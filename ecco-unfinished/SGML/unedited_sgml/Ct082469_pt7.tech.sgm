<P>THE King had hitherto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LVII.</NOTE> during the cour&s;e of
the war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1644.</NOTE> obtained many advantages over the
parliament, and had rai&s;ed him&s;elf from that
low condition, into which he had at fir&s;t fallen, to be
nearly upon an equal footing with his adver&s;aries. York|&s;hire,
and all the northern 'counties, were &s;ubjected by
the Marque&s;s of Newca&s;tle; and, excepting Hull, the
parliament was ma&s;ter of no garri&s;on in the&s;e quarters.
In the we&s;t, Plymouth alone, having been in vain be|&s;ieged
by Prince Maurice, re&s;i&s;ted the King's authority:
And had it not been for the di&s;appointment in the enter|prize
of Gloce&s;ter, the royal garri&s;ons had reached,
without interruption, from one end of the kingdom to
the other; and had occupied a greater extent of ground,

than tho&s;e of the parliament. Many of the royali&s;ts
flattered them&s;elves, that the &s;ame vigorous &s;pirit, which
had elevated them to the pre&s;ent height of power, would
&s;till favour their progre&s;s, and obtain them a final vic|tory
over their antagoni&s;ts: But tho&s;e who judged more
&s;oundly, ob&s;erved, that, be&s;ides the acce&s;&s;ion of the
whole Scots nation to the &s;ide of the parliament; the
very principle, on which the royal &s;ucce&s;&s;es had been
founded, was every day acquired, more and more, by
the oppo&s;ite party. The King's troops, full of gentry
and nobility, had exerted a valour &s;uperior to their ene|mies,
and had hitherto been &s;ucce&s;sful in almo&s;t every
rencounter: But in proportion as the whole nation be|came
warlike, by the continuance of civil di&s;cords, this
advantage was more equally &s;hared, and &s;uperior num|bers,
it was expected, mu&s;t at la&s;t obtain the victory.
The King's troops al&s;o, ill paid, and de&s;titute of every
nece&s;&s;ary, could not po&s;&s;ibly be retained in equal di&s;cipline
with the parliamentary forces, to whom all &s;upplies were
furni&s;hed from unexhau&s;ted &s;tores and trea&s;ures<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 560.</NOTE>. The
&s;everity of manners, &s;o much affected by the&s;e zealous
religioni&s;ts, a&s;&s;i&s;ted their military in&s;titutions; and the
rigid inflexibility of character, by which the au&s;tere re|formers
of church and &s;tate were di&s;tingui&s;hed, enabled
the parliamentary chiefs to re&s;train their &s;oldiers within
&s;tricter rules and more exact order. And while the
King's officers indulged them&s;elves even in greater li|cences,
than tho&s;e to which, during times of peace, they
had been accu&s;tomed, they were apt, both to neglect
their military duty, and to &s;et a pernicious example of
di&s;order, to the &s;oldiers under their command.</P>
<P>AT the commencement of the civil wars, all Engli&s;h|men,
who &s;erved abroad, were invited over, and treated
with extraordinary re&s;pect: And mo&s;t of them, being
de&s;cended of good families, and by rea&s;on of their ab|sence,
<PB N="3" REF="13">
unacquainted with the new principles, which de|pre&s;&s;ed
the dignity of the crown, had inli&s;ted under the
royal &s;tandard. But it is ob&s;ervable, that though the
military profe&s;&s;ion requires great genius, and, long ex|perience,
in the principal commanders, all its &s;ubordi|nate
duties may be di&s;charged by very ordinary talents,
and from &s;uperficial practice. Citizens and country-gentlemen
&s;oon became excellent officers; and the ge|nerals
of greate&s;t fame and capacity happened, all of
them, to &s;pring up on the &s;ide of the parliament. The
courtiers and great nobility in the other party, checked
the growth of any extraordinary genius among the &s;ub|ordinate
officers; and every man there, as in a regular
e&s;tabli&s;hed government, was confined to the &s;tation, in
which his birth had placed him.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might make preparations, during
the winter, for the en&s;uing campaign, &s;ummoned to
Oxford all the members of either hou&s;e, who adhered to
his intere&s;ts; and endeavoured to avail him&s;elf of the name
of parliament, &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately cheri&s;hed by the Engli&s;h
nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p, 559.</NOTE>. The hou&s;e of peers was pretty full; and be|&s;ides
the nobility, employed in different parts of the
kingdom, it contained twice as many members as voted
at We&s;tmin&s;ter. The hou&s;e of commons con&s;i&s;ted of
about 140; which amounted not to above half of the
other hou&s;e of commons<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 566, 574, 575.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO extremely light had government hitherto lain upon
the people, that the very name of <HI>exci&s;e</HI> was unknown
to them; and among the other evils ari&s;ing from the&s;e
dome&s;tic wars, was the introduction of that impo&s;t into
England. The parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter having voted
an exci&s;e on beer, wine, and other commodities; tho&s;e
at Oxford imitated the example, and coferred that re|venue
on the King. And in order to enable him the
better to recruit his army, they granted him the &s;um of

100,000 pounds, to be levied by way of loan upon the
&s;ubject. The King circulated privy &s;eals, counter&s;igned
by the &s;peakers of both hou&s;es, requiring the loan of par|ticular
&s;ums, from &s;uch per&s;ons as lived within his quar|ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 590.</NOTE>.
Neither party had as yet got above the pedantry
of reproaching their antagoni&s;ts with the&s;e illegal mea|&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE We&s;tmin&s;ter parliament pa&s;&s;ed a whim&s;ical or|dinance,
commanding all the inhabitants of London and
the neighbourhood, to retrench a meal a week, and to
pay the value of it for the &s;upport of the public cau&s;e<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Dugdale p. 119. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 748.</NOTE>.
'Tis ea&s;ily imagined, that, provided the money was paid,
they troubled them&s;elves very little about the execution
of their ordinance.</P>
<P>SUCH was the King's &s;ituation, that, in order to re|&s;tore
peace to the nation, he had no occa&s;ion to demand
any other terms, than to re&s;tore the laws and con&s;titu|tion,
to replace him in the &s;ame rights which had ever
been enjoyed by his predece&s;&s;ors, and to re-e&s;tabli&s;h,
on its antient ba&s;is, the whole frame of government,
civil as well as eccle&s;ia&s;tical. And that he might facili|tate
an end, &s;eemingly &s;o de&s;irable, he offered to employ
means equally popular, an univer&s;al act or oblivion, and
a toleration or indulgence to tender con&s;ciences. No|thing
therefore could contribute more to his intere&s;t,
than every di&s;cour&s;e of peace, and every di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the
Conditions, upon which that ble&s;&s;ing could be obtained.
And for this rea&s;on, he &s;ollicited a treaty, on all occa|&s;ions,
and de&s;ired a conference and mutual examination
of preten&s;ions, even when he entertained no hopes, that
any conclu&s;ion could po&s;&s;ibly re&s;ult from it.</P>
<P>FOR like rea&s;ons, the parliament wi&s;ely avoided, as
much as they could, all advances towards negotiation,
and were cautious not to expo&s;e too ea&s;ily to cen&s;ure
<PB N="5" REF="17">
tho&s;e high terms, which their apprehen&s;ions or their am|bition
made them previou&s;ly demand of the King. Tho'
their partizans were blinded with the thicke&s;t veil of re|ligious
prejudices, they dreaded to bring their preten&s;ions
to the te&s;t, or lay them open before the whole nation.
In oppo&s;ition to the &s;acred authority of the laws, to the
venerable precedents of many ages, they were a&s;hamed
to plead nothing but fears and jealou&s;ies, which were not
avowed by the con&s;titution, and to which, neither the
per&s;onal character of Charles, &s;o full of virtue, nor his
condition, &s;o deprived of all independent authority,
&s;eemed to afford any rea&s;onable foundation. Grievances
which had been fully redre&s;&s;ed; powers, either legal or
illegal, which had been entirely abandoned; it &s;eemed
unpopular, and invidious, and ungrateful, any farther
to in&s;i&s;t on.</P>
<P>THE King, that he might abate the univer&s;al vene|ration,
paid to the name of parliament, had i&s;&s;ued a de|claration,
in which he &s;et forth all the tumults, by
which him&s;elf and his partizans in both hou&s;es, had
been driven from London; and he thence inferred, that
the a&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter was no longer a free parlia|ment,
and, till its liberty was re&s;tored, was intitled to no
authority. As this declaration was an ob&s;tacle to all
treaty, &s;ome contrivance &s;eemed requi&s;ite, in order to
elude it.</P>
<P>A letter was wrote to the Earl of E&s;&s;ex, and &s;ub|&s;cribed
by the Prince, the Duke of York, and forty-three
noblemen<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 442. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 566. Whitlocke, p. 77.</NOTE>. They there exhort him to be an
in&s;trument for re&s;toring peace, and to promote that hap|py
end with tho&s;e, by whom he was employed. E&s;&s;ex,
though much di&s;gu&s;ted with the parliament, though ap|prehen&s;ive
of the extremities to which they were driving,
though de&s;irous of any rea&s;onable peace; yet was &s;till
<PB N="6" REF="18">
more re&s;olute to pre&s;erve an honourable fidelity to the
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. He replied, that as the paper &s;ent
him neither contained any addre&s;s to the two hou&s;es of
parliament, nor any acknowledgment of their authority,
he could not communiate it to them. Like propo&s;als
were reiterated by the King, during the en&s;uing campaign,
and met &s;till with a like an&s;wer from E&s;&s;ex<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 444. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 569, 570. Whit|locke, p. 94.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to make another trial for a treaty, the King,
this &s;pring, &s;ent another letter directed to the lords and
commons of parliament a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter: But
as he al&s;o mentioned, in the letter, the lords and com|mons
of parliament a&s;&s;embled at Oxford, and declared
that his &s;cope and intention was to make provi&s;ion that
all the members of both hou&s;es might &s;ecurely meet in a
full and free convention; the parliament, clearly per|ceiving
the conclu&s;ion which was implied, refu&s;ed all
treaty upon &s;uch terms<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 449. Whitlocke, p. 79.</NOTE>. And the King, who knew
what &s;mall hopes there were of accommodation, would
not abandon the preten&s;ions, which he had a&s;&s;umed, nor
acknowledge the two hou&s;es, more openly, for a free
parliament.</P>
<P>THIS winter the famous Pym died; a man as much
hated by the one party, as re&s;pected by the other. At
London, he was con&s;idered as the victim to national li|berty,
who had abridged his life by ince&s;&s;ant labours for
the intere&s;t of his country<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 66.</NOTE>: At Oxford, he was believed
to have been &s;truck with an uncommon di&s;ea&s;e, and to
have been con&s;umed with vermine; as a mark of divine
vengeance, for his multiplied crimes and trea&s;ons. He
had been &s;o little &s;tudious of improving his private fortune
in tho&s;e civil wars, of which he had been one principal
author, that the parliament thought them&s;elves obliged,
out of gratitude, to pay the debts which he had contract|ed<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Journ. 13th of February 1643.</NOTE>.
<PB N="7" REF="19">
We now return to the military operations, which,
during the winter, were carried on with vigor in &s;everal
places, notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE forces, brought from Ireland, were landed at
Mo&s;tyne in North-Wales; and being put under the com|mand
of Lord Biron, they took the ca&s;tles of Hawarden,
Bee&s;ton, Action, and Deddington-hou&s;e<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 299.</NOTE>. No place in Che&s;hire, or the neighbourhood, now adhered to the par|liament,
except Nantwich: And to this town Biron laid
&s;iege during the depth of winter. Sir Thomas Fairfax,
alarmed at &s;o con&s;iderable a progre&s;s, a&s;&s;embled an army
of 4000 men in York&s;hire, and having joined Sir Wil|liam
Brereton, was approaching to the camp of the
royali&s;ts. Biron and his &s;oldiers, elated with &s;ucce&s;&s;es
obtained in Ireland, had entertained the mo&s;t profound
contempt for the parliamentary forces; a di&s;po&s;ition,
which, if confined to the army, may be regarded as a
good pre&s;age of victory; but if it extend to the general,
is the mo&s;t probable forerunner of a defeat. Fairfax &s;ud|denly
attacked the camp of the royali&s;ts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of Jan.</NOTE> The &s;welling
of the river by a thaw divided one part of the army from
the other. That part expo&s;ed to Fairfax, being beat
from their po&s;t, retired into the church of Acton, and
were all taken pri&s;oners: The other retreated with pre|cipitation<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 301.</NOTE>. And thus was di&s;&s;ipated or rendered u&s;ele&s;s
that body of forces, which had been drawn from Ireland;
and the parliamentary party revived in tho&s;e north-we&s;t
counties of England.</P>
<P>THE inva&s;ion from Scotland was attended with con|&s;equences
of much greater importance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion from Scot|land.</NOTE> The Scots,
having &s;ummoned in vain the town of Newca&s;tle, which
was fortified by the vigilance of Sir Thomas Glenham,
pa&s;&s;ed the Tyne; and faced the Marque&s;s of Newca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Feb.</NOTE>
who lay at Durham with an army of 14000 men<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 615.</NOTE>. Af|ter
<PB N="8" REF="20">
&s;ome military operations, in which that general re|duced
the enemy to difficulties for forage and prvo&s;ions,
he received intelligence of a great di&s;a&s;ter, which had
befallen his forces in York&s;hire. Colonel Bella&s;is, whom
he had left with a con&s;iderable body of troops, was to|tally
routed at Selby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th April.</NOTE> by Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had
returned from Che&s;hire, with his victorious forces<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 618.</NOTE>.
Afraid of being inclo&s;ed between two armies, Newca&s;tle
retreated; and Leven having joined Lord Fairfax, they
&s;at down before York, in which the army of the royali&s;ts
had &s;hut them&s;elves up. But as the Scots and parlia|mentary
forces were not numerous enough to inve&s;t &s;o
large a town, divided by a river, they contented them|selves
to incommode it by a loo&s;e blockade; and affairs
remained, for &s;ome time, in &s;u&s;pen&s;e between the&s;e op|po&s;ite
armies<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING this winter and &s;pring, other parts of the
kingdom had al&s;o been harra&s;&s;ed with war. Hopton,
having a&s;&s;embled an army of 14000 men, endeavoured
to break into Su&s;&s;ex, Kent, and the &s;outhern a&s;&s;ociation,
which &s;eemed well di&s;po&s;ed to receive him. Waller fell
upon him at Cherington, and gave him a defeat<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">29th of March.</NOTE> of con|&s;iderable
importance. In another quarter, &s;iege being
laid to Newark by the parliamentary forces, Prince Ru|pert
prepared him&s;elf for relieving a town of &s;uch con&s;e|quence,
which alone pre&s;erved the communication open
between the King's &s;outhern and northern quarters<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 306.</NOTE>.
With a &s;mall force, but that animated by his active cou|rage,
he broke thro' the enemy, relieved the town, and
totally di&s;&s;ipated that army of the parliament<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">21&s;t of March.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT tho' fortune &s;eemed to have divided her favours
between the parties, the King found him&s;elf, in the
main, a con&s;iderable lo&s;er by this winter-campaign; and
he progno&s;ticated a &s;till wor&s;e event from the en&s;uing
<PB N="9" REF="21">
&s;ummer. The preparations of the parliament were great,
and much exceeded the &s;lender re&s;ources, of which he
was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. In the ea&s;tern a&s;&s;ociation, they levied
14000 men, under the Earl of Manche&s;ter, &s;econded by
Cromwel<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 621.</NOTE>. An army of ten thou&s;and men under E&s;&s;ex;
another of nearly the &s;ame force under Waller, were
a&s;&s;embled in the neighbourhood of London. The for|mer
was de&s;tined to oppo&s;e the King: The latter was
appointed to march into the we&s;t, where Prince Maurice,
with a &s;mall army which went continually to decay, was
&s;pending his time in vain before Lyme, an incon&s;iderable
town upon the &s;ea-coa&s;t. The utmo&s;t efforts of the
King could not rai&s;e above ten thousand men at Oxford;
and on their &s;word chiefly, during the campaign, were
the&s;e to depend for &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE Queen, terrified with the dangers, which every
way environed her, and afraid of being enclo&s;ed in Ox|ford,
in the middle of the kingdom, fled to Exeter,
where &s;he hoped to be delivered unmole&s;ted of the child,
of which &s;he was now pregnant, and from whence &s;he
had the means of an ea&s;y e&s;cape into France, if pre&s;&s;ed by
the forces of the enemy. She knew the implacable ha|tred,
which the parliament, on account of her religion
and her credit with the King, had all along borne her.
La&s;t &s;ummer, the commons had &s;ent up to the peers an
impeachment of high trea&s;on again&s;t her; becau&s;e, in
his utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he had a&s;&s;i&s;ted her hu&s;band with
arms and ammunition, which &s;he had bought in Hol|land<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 321.</NOTE>.
And had &s;he fallen into their hands, neither her
&s;ex, &s;he knew, nor high &s;tation, could protect her again&s;t
in&s;ults at lea&s;t, if not danger, from tho&s;e haughty re|publicans,
who &s;o little affected to conduct them&s;elves by
the maxims of gallantry and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning of the&s;e di&s;&s;en&s;ions, the parlia|ment,
'tis remarkable, had, in all things a&s;&s;umed an ex|treme
<PB N="10" REF="22">
a&s;cendant over their &s;overeign, and had di&s;played a
violence and arrogated an authority, which, on his &s;ide,
could not have been compatible, either with his temper or
his &s;ituation. While he &s;poke, perpetually of pardoning
all <HI>Rebels;</HI> they talked of nothing but the punihment of
<HI>Delinquents</HI> and <HI>Malignants:</HI> While he offered a tolera|tion
and an indulgence to tender con&s;ciences; they
threatened the utter extirpation of prelacy: To his pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of lenity, they oppo&s;ed declarations of rigor:
And the more the antient tenour of the laws inculcated
a re&s;pectful &s;ubordination to the crown, the more careful
were they, by their lofty preten&s;ions, to cover that defect,
under which they laboured.</P>
<P>THEIR great advantages in the north &s;eemed to &s;econd
their ambition, and finally to promi&s;e them &s;ucce&s;s in
their unwarrantable enterprizes. Manche&s;ter, having
taken Lincoln, had united his army to tho&s;e of Leven
and Fairfax; and York was now clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by their
combined forces. That town, though vigorou&s;ly de|fended
by Newca&s;tle, was reduced to extremity; and the
parliamentary generals, after enduring great lo&s;&s;es and
fatigue, flattered them&s;elves that all their labours would
at laft be crowned by that important conque&s;t. On a
&s;udden, they were alarmed with the approach of Rupert.
That gallant Prince, having vigorou&s;ly exerted him&s;elf
in Lanca&s;hire and Che&s;hire, had collected a con&s;iderable
army; and joining Sir Charles Lucas, who commanded
Newca&s;tle's hor&s;e, ha&s;tened to the relief of York with
an army of 20,000 men. The Scots and parliamentary
generals rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and drawing up on Mar&s;ton-moor,
propo&s;ed to give battle to the royali&s;ts. Prince
Rupert approached the town by another quarter, and in|terpo&s;ing
the river Ou&s;e between him and the enemy,
&s;afely joined his forces to tho&s;e of Newca&s;tle. The
Marque&s;s endeavoured to per&s;uade him, that, having &s;o
&s;ucce&s;fully effected his purpo&s;e, he ought to be con|tented
<PB N="11" REF="23">
with the pre&s;ent advantage, and leave the enemy,
now much dimini&s;hed by their lo&s;&s;es, and di&s;couraged by
their ill &s;ucce&s;s, to di&s;&s;olve by tho&s;e mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions,
which had taken place among them<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Life of the D. of Newca&s;tle, p. 40.</NOTE>. The Prince,
who&s;e martial di&s;po&s;ition was not &s;ufficiently tempered
with prudence, nor &s;oftened by complai&s;ance, pretend|ing
a po&s;itive order from the King, without deigning to
con&s;ult with Newca&s;tle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of July.</NOTE> who&s;e great merit and &s;ervices
de&s;erved better treatment, immediately gave orders for
battle, and drew out the whole army to Mar&s;ton-moor<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 506.</NOTE>.
This action was ob&s;tinately di&s;puted between the mo&s;t
numerous armies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Mar&s;ton-Moor.</NOTE>
which were engaged during the whole
cour&s;e of the&s;e wars; nor were the forces on each &s;ide
much different in their number. Fifty thou&s;and Briti&s;h
troops were led to mutual &s;laughter; and the victory
&s;eemed long undecided between them. Rupert, who
commanded the right wing of the royali&s;ts, was oppo&s;ed
to Cromwel<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. part 3. vol. ii. p. 633.</NOTE>, who conducted the choice troops of the
parliament, enured to danger under that determined
leader, animated by zeal, and confirmed by the mo&s;t ri|gid
di&s;cipline. After a &s;harp combat, the cavalry of the
royali&s;ts gave way; and the infantry, who &s;tood next
them, were likewi&s;e borne down, and put to flight.
Newca&s;tle's regiment alone, re&s;olute to conquer or to
peri&s;h, ob&s;tinately kept their ground, and maintained, by
their dead bodies, the &s;ame order, in which they had at
fir&s;t been ranged. In the other wing Sir Thomas Fair|fax
and Colonel Lambert, with &s;ome troops, broke thro'
the royali&s;ts; and, tran&s;ported by the fury of pur&s;uit,
&s;oon reached their victorious friends, engaged al&s;o in
pur&s;uit of the enemy. But after that tempe&s;t was pa&s;t,
Lucas, who commanded the royali&s;ts in this wing, re|&s;toring
order to his broken forces, made a furious attack
on the parliamentary cavalry, threw them into di&s;order,

pu&s;hed them upon their own infantry, and put that whole
wing to rout. When ready to &s;eize on their carriages
and baggage, he perceived Cromwel, who was now re|turned
from pur&s;uit of the other wing. Both &s;ides were
not a little &s;urpri&s;ed to find that they mu&s;t again renew
the combat for that victory, which each of them thought
they had already obtained. The front of the battle was
now exactly counterchanged, and each army occupied
the ground, which had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the enemy at
the beginning of the day. This &s;econd battle was equally
furious and de&s;perate at the fir&s;t: But after the utmo&s;t
efforts of courage by both parties, victory wholly inclined
to the &s;ide of the parliament. The Prince's train of ar|tillery
was taken; and his whole army pu&s;hed off the
field of battle<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 632. Whitlocke, p. 89.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS event was in it&s;elf, a mighty blow to the King;
but proved much more fatal in its con&s;equences. The
Marque&s;s of Newca&s;tle was intirely lo&s;t to the royal
cau&s;e. That Nobleman, the ornament of the court and
of his order, had been engaged, contrary to the natural
bent of his di&s;po&s;ition, into the&s;e military operations,
merely by a high &s;en&s;e of honour and a per&s;onal regard
to his ma&s;ter. The dangers of war were di&s;regarded by
his valour; but its fatigues were oppre&s;&s;ive to his natural
indolence. Munificent and generous in his expence;
polite and elegant in his ta&s;te; courteous and humane in
his behaviour; he brought a great acce&s;&s;ion of friends
and of credit to the party, which he embraced. But
amid&s;t all the hurry of action, his inclinations were &s;e|cretly
drawn to the &s;oft arts of peace, in which he took
delight; and the charms of poetry, mu&s;ic, and conver|&s;ation
&s;tole him often from his rougher occupations. He
cho&s;e Sir William Davenant, an ingenious poet, his
lieutenant-general: The other per&s;ons, in whom he
placed confidence, were more the in&s;truments of his re|fined
<PB N="13" REF="27">
plea&s;ures, than qualified for the bu&s;ine&s;s which
they undertook: And the &s;everity and application, re|qui&s;ite
to the &s;upport of di&s;cipline, were qualities in which
he was entirely wanting.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 507, 508. &s;ee Warwick.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN Prince Rupert, contrary to his advice, re&s;olved
on this battle, and i&s;&s;ued all orders without communi|cating
his intentions to him; he took the field, but, he
&s;aid, intirely as a volunteer; and, except by his per&s;onal
courage, which &s;hone out with lu&s;tre, he had no &s;hare
in the action. Enraged to find, that all his &s;ucce&s;sful
labours were rendered abortive by one act of fatal teme|rity,
terrified with the pro&s;pect of renewing all his pains
and fatigue, he re&s;olved no longer to maintain the few
re&s;ources which remained to a de&s;perate cau&s;e, and
thought, that the &s;ame regard to honour, which had at
fir&s;t called him to arms, now required him to abandon a
party, where he met with &s;uch unworthy treatment.
Next morning early, he &s;ent word to the Prince, that
he was in&s;tantly to leave the kingdom; and without de|lay,
he went to Scarborough, where he found a ve&s;&s;el,
which carried him beyond &s;ea. During the en&s;uing
years, till the re&s;toration, he lived abroad in great nece&s;|&s;ity,
and &s;aw with indifference his opulent fortune &s;e|que&s;tered
by tho&s;e who a&s;&s;med the government of Eng|land.
He di&s;dained, by &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion or compo&s;ition, to
&s;how obei&s;ance to their u&s;urped authority; and the lea&s;t
favourable cen&s;ors of his merit allowed, that the fidelity
and &s;ervices of a whole life, had &s;ufficiently atoned for
one ra&s;h action, into which his pa&s;&s;ion had betrayed
him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 511.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE Rupert with equal precipitation drew off the
remains of his army, and retired into Lanca&s;hire. Glen|ham,

his government in that whole county, and &s;ent a thou|sand
hor&s;e into Lanca&s;hire, to join with the parliamentary
forces in that quarter, and attend the motions of Prince
Rupert: The Scots army marched northwards, in order
to join the Earl of Calender, who was advancing with
ten thou&s;and additional forces<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 88.</NOTE>; and to reduce the town
of Newca&s;tle, which they took by &s;torm: The Earl of
Manche&s;ter, with Cromwel, to whom the fame of this
great victory was chiefly a&s;cribed, and who was wounded
in the action, return'd to the ea&s;tern a&s;&s;ociation, in order
to recruit his army<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 641.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e events pa&s;&s;ed in the north, the King's
affairs in the &s;outh were conducted with more &s;ucce&s;s and
more ability. Ruthven, a Scot&s;man, who had been
created Earl of Brentford, acted, under the King, as ge|neral.</P>
<P>THE parliament &s;oon compleated their two armies
commanded by E&s;&s;ex and Waller. The great zeal of
the city facilitated this undertaking. Many &s;peeches
were made to the citizens, by the parliamentary leaders,
in order to excite their ardour. Hollis, in particular,
exhorted them not to &s;pare, on this important occa&s;ion,
either their pur&s;es, their per&s;ons, or their prayers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vi. p. 662.</NOTE>; and
they were &s;ufficiently liberal, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in all
the&s;e contributions. The two generals had orders to
march with their combined armies towards Oxford; and,
if the King &s;hut him&s;elf up in that city, to lay &s;iege to
it, and by one enterprize to put a period to the war.
The King, leaving a numerous garri&s;on in Oxford,
pa&s;&s;ed with dexterity between the two armies, which had
taken Abingdon and had enclo&s;ed him on both &s;ides<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">3d of June.</NOTE>.
He marched towards Worce&s;ter; and Waller received
orders from E&s;&s;ex to follow him and watch his motions;
<PB N="15" REF="31">
while he him&s;elf marched into the we&s;t, in que&s;t of Prince
Maurice. Waller had approached within two miles of
the royal camp, and was only &s;eparated from it by the
Severn, when he received intelligence, that the King
was advanced to Beudly, and directed his cour&s;e towards
Shrew&s;bury. In order to prevent him, Waller pre|&s;ently di&s;lodged, and ha&s;tened by quick marches to that
city: When the King, &s;uddenly returning upon his own
foot-&s;teps, reached Oxford; and having reinforced his
army from that garri&s;on, now in his turn marched out
in que&s;t of Waller. The two armies faced each other
at Cropredy-bridge near.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Cropredy-bridge.</NOTE> Banbury; but the Charwell
ran betwixt them. Next day, the King di&s;lodged and
marched towards Daventry. Waller ordered a con&s;ider|able
detachment to pa&s;s the bridge, with an intention of
falling on the rear of the royali&s;ts. He wad repul&s;ed,
routed, and pur&s;ued with con&s;iderable lo&s;s<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 676. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 497. Sir Edward Walker, p. 31.</NOTE>. Stunned
and di&s;heartened with this blow, his army decayed and
melted away by de&s;ertion; and the King thought he
might &s;afely leave it, and march we&s;tward again&s;t
E&s;&s;ex. That general, having obliged Prince Maurice
to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Lyme, having taken Weymouth and
Taunton, advanced &s;till in his conque&s;ts, and met with
no equal oppo&s;ition. The King followed him, and hav|ing
re-inforced his army from all quarters, appeared in
the field with an army &s;uperior to the enemy. E&s;&s;ex,
retreating into Cornwall, informed the parliament of his
danger, and de&s;ired them to &s;end an army, which might
fall on the King's rear. General Middleton received a
commi&s;&s;ion to execute that &s;ervice; but came too late.
E&s;&s;ex's army, cooped up in a narrow corner at Le&s;tithiel,
deprived of all forage and provi&s;ions, and &s;eeing no pro&s;|pect
of &s;uccour, was reduced to the la&s;t extremity. The

<P>NO &s;ooner did this news reach London, than the com|mittee

of their authority.</P>
<P>THAT the King might have le&s;s rea&s;on to exult in
the advantages, which he had obtained in the we&s;t, the
parliament oppo&s;ed to him very numerous forces. Hav|ing
armed anew E&s;&s;ex's &s;ubdued, but not di&s;heartned

Newbury, where Charles cho&s;e his po&s;t, they attacked
him with great vigour; and that town was a &s;econd
time the &s;cene of the bloody animo&s;ities of the Engli&s;h.
E&s;&s;ex's &s;oldiers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of Oct.</NOTE> exhorting one another to repair their

made an impetuous a&s;&s;ault on the royali&s;ts; and having
recovered &s;ome of their cannon, lo&s;t in Cornwall, could
not forbear embracing them with tears of joy. Though
the King's troops defended them&s;elves with great valour,
they were overpower'd by numbers; and the night came
very &s;ea&s;onably to their relief, and prevented a total
overthrow. Charles leaving his baggage and cannon in
Dennington-ca&s;tle, near Newbury, forthwith retreated
to Wallingford, and from thence to Oxford. There
Prince Rupert and the Earl of Northampton joined him,
with con&s;iderable bodies of cavalry. Strengthened by
this re-inforcement, he ventured to advance towards the
enemy, now employed before Dennington-ca&s;tle<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 721, &amp;c.</NOTE>. E&s;&s;ex,
detained by &s;ickne&s;s, had not joined the army,
&s;ince his misfortune in Cornwall. Manche&s;ter who
commanded, though his forces were much &s;uperior to
tho&s;e of the King, declined an engagement, and reject|ed
Cromwel's advice, who earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed him not to

war. The King's army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Nov.</NOTE> by bringing off their cannon
from Dennington-ca&s;tle, in the face of the enemy,
&s;eemed &s;ufficiently to have repaired the honour, which
they had lo&s;t at Newbury; and Charles having the &s;ati&s;|faction
to excite, between Manche&s;ter and Cromwel,
equal animo&s;ities with tho&s;e which formerly took place
between E&s;&s;ex and Waller<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. 7. p. 1.</NOTE>, di&s;tributed his army into
winter-quarters.</P>
<P>THOSE conte&s;ts among the parliamentary generals,
which had di&s;turbed their military operations, were re|newed
in London during the winter; and each being
&s;upported by his own faction, their mutual reproaches
and accu&s;ations agitated the whole city and parliament.
There had long prevailed, in that party, a &s;ecret di&s;tinc|tion,
which, though the dread of the King's power had
hitherto &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it, yet, in proportion as the hopes of
<PB N="18" REF="36">
&s;ucce&s;s became nearer and more immediate, began to di&s;|cover
it&s;elf, with high conte&s;t and animo&s;ity. The IN|DEPENDENTS,
who had, at fir&s;t, taken &s;helter and con|cealed
them&s;elves under the wings of the PRESBYTE|RIANS,
now evidently appeared a di&s;tinct party, and be|trayed
very different views and preten&s;ions. We mu&s;t
here endeavour to explain the genius of this party, and
of its leaders, who henceforth occupy the &s;cene of ac|tion.</P>
<P>DURING tho&s;e times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ri&s;e and character of the indepen|dents.</NOTE> when the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit met
with &s;uch honour and encouragement, and was the im|mediate
means of di&s;tinction and preferment; it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to &s;et bounds to the&s;e holy fervors, or confine
within any natural limits, what was directed towards an
infinite and a &s;upernatural object. Every man, as prompt|ed
by the warmth of his temper, excited by emulation,
or &s;upported by his habits of hypocri&s;y, endeavoured to
di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf beyond his fellows, and to arrive at a
higher pitch of &s;aint&s;hip and perfection. In proportion
to its degrees of fanatici&s;m, each &s;ect became dangerous
and de&s;tructive, and as the independents went a note
higher than the pre&s;byterians, they could le&s;s be re|&s;trained
within any bounds of temper and moderation.
From this di&s;tinction, as from a fir&s;t principle, were de|rived,
by a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence, all the other differ|ences
of the&s;e two &s;ects.</P>
<P>THE independents rejected all eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ments,
and would admit of no church courts, no go|vernment
among pa&s;tors, no interpo&s;ition of the magi|&s;trate
in &s;piritual concerns, no fixed encouragement an|nexed
to any &s;y&s;tem of doctrines or opinions. Accord|ing
to their principles, each congregation, united volun|tarily
and by &s;piritual ties, compo&s;ed, within it&s;elf, a &s;e|parate
church, and exerci&s;ed a juri&s;diction, but one de|void
of temporal &s;anctions, over its own pa&s;tor and its
<PB N="19" REF="37">
own members. The election alone of the congregation
was &s;ufficient to be&s;tow the &s;acerdotal character; and as
all e&s;&s;ential di&s;tinction was denied between the laity and
the clergy, no ceremony, no in&s;titution, no vocation,
no impo&s;ition of hands, was &s;uppo&s;ed, as in all other
churches, to be requi&s;ite to convey a right to the holy
order. The enthu&s;ia&s;m of the pre&s;byterians led them to
&s;hake off the authority of prelates, to reject the re&s;traint
of liturgies, to retrench ceremonies, to limit the riches
and authority of the prie&s;tly office: The fanatici&s;m of
the independents, exalted to a higher pitch, aboli&s;hed
all eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, di&s;dained all creeds and
&s;y&s;tems, rejected every ceremony, and confounded each
rank and order. The &s;oldier, the merchant, the me|chanic,
indulging the fervors of zeal, and guided by the
illap&s;es of the &s;pirit, gave him&s;elf up to an inward and
&s;uperior direction, and was con&s;ecrated, in a manner, by an
immediate intercour&s;e and communication with Heaven.</P>
<P>THE catholics, pretending to an infallible guide, had
ju&s;tified, upon that principle, their doctrine and practice
of per&s;ecution: The pre&s;byterians, imagining that &s;uch
clear and certain tenets, as they them&s;elves adopted,
could be rejected only from a criminal and pertinacious
ob&s;tinacy, had hitherto gratified, to the full, their bi|gotted
zeal in a like doctrine and practice: The inde|pendents,
from the extremity of the &s;ame zeal, were led
into the milder principles of toleration. Their mind,
&s;et afloat in the wide &s;ea of in&s;piration, could confine it|&s;elf
within no certain limits; and the &s;ame variations,
in which an enthu&s;ia&s;t indulged him&s;elf, he was apt, by
a natural train of thinking, to permit in others. Of all
chri&s;tian &s;ects, this was the fir&s;t, which, during its pro&s;|perity,
as well as its adver&s;ity, always adopted the prin|ciple
of toleration; and, 'tis remarkable, that &s;o rea&s;on|able
a doctrine owed its origin, not to rea&s;oning, but to
the height of extravagance and fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="38">
POPERY and prelacy alone, who&s;e genius, they
thought, tended towards &s;uper&s;tition, the independents
were inclined to treat with rigour. The doctrines too
of fate or de&s;tiny, they were apt to deem e&s;&s;ential to all
religion. In the&s;e rigid opinions, the whole &s;ectaries,
amid&s;t all their other differences, unanimou&s;ly concur|red.</P>
<P>THE political &s;y&s;tem of the independents kept pace
with their religious. Not contented with confining, to
very narrow limits, the power of their &s;overeign, and
reducing the king to the rank of fir&s;t magi&s;trate; which
was the project of the pre&s;byterians; this &s;ect, more a$|dent
in the pur&s;uit of liberty, a&s;pired to a total abolition
of the monarchy, and even of the ari&s;tocracy; and pro|jected
an intire equality of rank and order, in a re|public,
quite free and independent. In con&s;equence of
this &s;cheme, they were declared enemies to all propo&s;als
for peace, except on &s;uch terms as, they knew, it was
impo&s;&s;ible to obtain; and they adhered to that maxim,
which is, in the main, prudent and political, that who|ever
draws the &s;word again&s;t his &s;overeign, &s;hould throw
away the &s;cabbard. By terrifying others with the fear
of vengeance from the injured prince, they had engaged
greater numbers into the oppo&s;ition again&s;t peace, and
had adopted their other principles with regard to govern|ment
and religion. And the great &s;ucce&s;s, which had
already attended the arms of the parliament, and the
greater, which was &s;oon expected, confirmed them &s;till
further in this ob&s;tinacy.</P>
<P>SIR Harry Vane, Oliver Cromwel, Nathaniel Fien|nes,
and Oliver St. John, the &s;ollicitor-general, were
regarded as the leaders of the independents. The Earl
of E&s;&s;ex, di&s;gu&s;ted with a war, of which he began to
fore&s;ee the pernicious con&s;equences, adhered to the pre&s;|byterians,
and promoted every rea&s;onable plan of ac|commodation.
<PB N="21" REF="39">
The Earl of Northumberland, fond of
his rank and dignity, regarded with horror a &s;cheme,
which, if it took place, would confound him&s;elf and his
family with the lowe&s;t in the kingdom. The Earls of
Warwic, and Denbigh, Sir Philip Stapleton, Sir Wil|liam
Waller, Hollis, Ma&s;&s;ey, Whitelocke, Mainard,
Glyn, had embraced the &s;ame &s;entiments. In the par|liament,
a con&s;iderable majority, and a much greater in
the nation, were attached to the pre&s;byterian party; and
it was only by cunning and deceit at fir&s;t, and after|wards
by violence, that the independents could entertain
any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Manche&s;ter, provoked at the violent
impeachment, which the King had lodged again&s;t him,
had long forwarded the war with great alacrity; but,
being a man of humanity and good principles, the view
of public calamities, and the pro&s;pect of a total &s;ubver|&s;ion
of government, began to moderate his ardor, and
inclined him to promote peace on any &s;afe or honour|able
terms. He was even &s;u&s;pected, in the field, not
to have pu&s;hed to the utmo&s;t again&s;t the King the ad|vantages,
obtained by the arms of the parliament; and
Cromwel, in the public debates, revived the accu&s;ation,
that he had wilfully neglected at Dennington-ca&s;tle a
favourable opportunity of fini&s;hing the war by a total
defeat of the royali&s;ts. &startq;I &s;howed him evidently,&endq;
&s;aid Cromwel, &startq;how this &s;ucce&s;s might be obtained;
and only de&s;ired leave, with my own brigade of hor&s;e,
to charge the King's army in their retreat; leaving
it in the Earl's choice, if he thought proper, to re|main
neuter with the re&s;t of his forces: But, not|with&s;tanding
all my importunity, he po&s;itively and
ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed his con&s;ent; and gave no other
rea&s;on but that, if we met with a defeat, there was
an end of our preten&s;ions: We &s;hould all be rebels
<PB N="22" REF="40">
and traitors, and be executed and forfeited by the
law<NOTE N="m" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 561.</NOTE>?&endq;</P>
<P>MANCHESTER, by way of recrimination, informed
the parliament, that at another time, Cromwel having
propo&s;ed &s;ome &s;cheme, which it &s;eemed improbable the
parliament would agree to, he in&s;i&s;ted and &s;aid, <HI>My
Lord, if you will &s;tick firm to hone&s;t men, you &s;hall find
your&s;elf at the head of an army, which will give law both to
king and parliament.</HI> &startq;This di&s;cour&s;e,&endq; continued Man|che&s;ter,
&startq;made the greater impre&s;&s;ion on me, becau&s;e
I knew the lieutenant-general to be a man of very
deep de&s;igns; and he has even ventured to tell me,
that it never would be well with England till I was
Mr. Montague, and there was ne'er a lord or peer in
the kingdom<NOTE N="n" PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol. v. p. 562.</NOTE>.&endq; So full was Cromwel of the&s;e re|publican projects, that notwith&s;tanding his habits of
profound hypocri&s;y, he could not &s;o carefully guard his
expre&s;&s;ions, but that &s;ometimes his favourite notions
would e&s;cape him.</P>
<P>THESE violent di&s;&s;entions brought matters to extre|mity,
and pu&s;hed the independents to the execution of
their de&s;igns. The pre&s;ent generals, they thought,
were more de&s;irous of protracting than fini&s;hing the war;
and having entertained a &s;cheme for pre&s;erving &s;till &s;ome
ballance in the con&s;titution, they were afraid of intirely
&s;ubduing the King, and reducing him to a condition,
where he &s;hould be intitled to a&s;k no conce&s;&s;ions. A
new model alone of the army would bring compleat vic|tory
to the parliament, and free the nation from tho&s;e
calamities, under which it laboured. But how to effect
this project was the difficulty. The authority, as well
as merits of E&s;&s;ex, was very great with the parliament.
Not only he had &s;erved them all along with the mo&s;t
exact and &s;crupulous honour: It was, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
to be a&s;cribed to his popularity, that they had ever been
<PB N="23" REF="41">
enabled to levy an army or make head again&s;t the royal
cau&s;e. Manche&s;ter, Warwic, and the other commanders
had likewi&s;e great credit with the public; nor were there
any hopes of prevailing over them, but by laying the
plan of an oblique and artificial attack, which would
conceal the real purpo&s;e of their antagoni&s;ts. The Scots
and Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, jealous of the progre&s;s of the
independents, were a new ob&s;tacle; which, without the
utmo&s;t art and &s;ubtlety, it would be difficult to &s;ur|mount<NOTE N="o" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 562.</NOTE>.
The methods by which this intrigue was con|ducted,
are &s;o &s;ingular, and mark &s;o well the genius of
the age, that we &s;hall give a detail of them, as they are
delivered by Lord Clarendon<NOTE N="p" PLACE="marg">Ibid. vol, v. p. 565.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A FAST, on the la&s;t Wedne&s;day of every month, had
been ordered by the parliament at the beginning of the&s;e
commotions; and their preachers, on that day, kept
alive, by their vehement declamations, the popular pre|judices
entertained again&s;t the King, again&s;t prelacy, and
again&s;t popery. The King, that he might combat the
parliament with their own weapons, appointed likewi&s;e
a monthly fa&s;t, where the people &s;hould be in&s;tructed in
the duties of loyalty and of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the higher
powers; and he cho&s;e the &s;econd Friday of every
month for the devotion of the royali&s;ts<NOTE N="q" PLACE="marg">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 364.</NOTE>. It was now
propo&s;ed and carried in parliament, by the independents,
that a new and more &s;olemn fa&s;t &s;hould be voted; when
they &s;hould implore the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance for extricating
them from tho&s;e perplexities, in which they were at pre|&s;ent
involved. On that day, the preachers, after many
political prayers, took care to treat of the reigning divi&s;ions
in the parliament, and a&s;cribed them entirely to the &s;elfi&s;h
ends, pur&s;ued by the members. In the hands of tho&s;e
members, they &s;aid, are lodged all the con&s;iderable com|mands
of the army, all the profitable offices in the civil
<PB N="24" REF="42">
admini&s;tration: And while the nation is falling every
day into poverty, and groans under an in&s;upportable
load of taxes; the&s;e men multiply po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions,
and will, in a little time, be ma&s;ters of all the
riches in the kingdom. That &s;uch per&s;ons, who fatten
in the calamities of their country, will ever embrace any
effectual mea&s;ure for bringing them to a period, or en|&s;uring
a final &s;ucce&s;s to the war, cannot rea&s;onably be
expected. Lingering expedients alone will be pur&s;ued:
And operations in the field concurring, in the &s;ame per|nicious
end, with deliberations of the cabinet; civil
commotions will, for ever, be perpetuated in the nation.
After exaggerating the&s;e di&s;orders, the mini&s;ters fell
again to their prayers; and be&s;ought the Lord that he
would take his own work into his own hand; and if the
in&s;truments, whom he had hitherto employed, were not
worthy to bring to a conclu&s;ion &s;o glorious a de&s;ign, that
$e would in&s;pire others more fit, who might perfect what
was begun, and by e&s;tabli&s;hing true religion, put a
&s;peedy period to the public mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>ON the day &s;ub&s;equent to the&s;e devout animadver&s;ions,
when the parliament met, a new &s;pirit appeared in the
looks of many. Sir Henry Vane told the commons,
That, if ever God appeared to them, it was in the
holy ordinances of ye&s;terday: That, as he was credibly
informed by many, who had been auditors in different
congregations, the &s;ame lamentations and di&s;cour&s;es,
which the godly preachers had made before them, had
been heard in other churches: That &s;o remarkable a
concurrence could proceed only from the immediate ope|ration
of the Holy Spirit: That he therefore be&s;ought
them, in vindication of their own honour, in confidera|tion
of their duty to God and their country, to lay a&s;ide
all private ends, and renounce every office, attended
with profit or advantage: That the ab&s;ence of &s;o many
members, occupied in different employments, had ren|dered
<PB N="25" REF="43">
the hou&s;e extremely thin, and dimini&s;hed the au|thority
of their determination: And that he could not
forbear, for his own part, the accu&s;ing him&s;elf as one
who enjoyed a gainful office, that of trea&s;urer of the
navy; and though he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it before the civil
commotions, and owed it not to the favour of the par|liament,
yet was he ready to re&s;ign it, and to &s;acrifice,
to the welfare of his country, every con&s;ideration of pri|vate
intere&s;t and advantage.</P>
<P>CROMWEL acted next his part, and commended the
preachers for having dealt with them plainly and impar|tially,
and told them of their errors, of which they were
&s;o unwilling to be in&s;tructed. Though they dwelt on
many things, he &s;aid, on which he had never before re|flected;
yet, upon revolving them, he could not but
confe&s;s, that, till there was a perfect reformation in
the&s;e particulars, nothing which they undertook could
po&s;&s;ibly pro&s;per. The parliament, no doubt, continued
he, had done wi&s;ely in the commencement of the war,
to engage &s;everal of their members in the mo&s;t dange|gerous
parts of it; and thereby to &s;atisfy the nation,
that they intended to &s;hare all hazards with the meane&s;t
of the people. But affairs are now changed. During
the progre&s;s of military operations, there have ari&s;en, in
the parliamentary armies, many excellent officers, who
are qualified for higher commands than they are now
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. And though it becomes not men, engaged
in &s;uch a cau&s;e, <HI>to put tru&s;t in the arm of fle&s;h,</HI> yet he
could a&s;&s;ure them, that their troops contained generals,
fit to command in any enterprize in Chri&s;tendom. The
army indeed, he was &s;orry to &s;ay, did not corre&s;pond,
by its di&s;cipline, to the merit of the officers; nor
were there any hopes, till the pre&s;ent vices and di&s;or|ders,
which prevail among the &s;oldiers, were repre&s;&s;ed
by a new model, that their forces would ever be at|tended
with &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s in any undertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="44">
IN oppo&s;ition to this rea&s;oning of the independents,
many of the pre&s;byterians &s;howed the inconvenience and
dangers of the projected alteration. Whitelocke, in
particular, a man of honour, who loved his country,
though, in every change of government, he always ad|hered
to the ruling power, &s;aid, That, be&s;ides the in|gratitude
of di&s;carding, and that by fraud and &s;ubtilty,
&s;o many noble per&s;ons, to whom the parliament had hi|therto
owed its chief &s;upport; they would find it ex|tremely
difficult to &s;upply the place of men, now formed
by experience to command and authority: That the
rank alone, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by &s;uch as were members of either
hou&s;e, prevented envy, retained the army in obedience,
and gave weight to military orders: That greater confi|dence
might &s;afely be repo&s;ed in men of family and for|tune,
than in mere adventurers, who would be apt to
entertain &s;eparate views from tho&s;e embraced by the per|&s;ons,
who employed them: That no maxim of policy
was more undi&s;puted, than the nece&s;&s;ity of pre&s;erving an
in&s;eparable connexion between the civil and military
powers, and of retaining the latter in &s;trict &s;ubordination
to the former: That the Greeks and Romans, the wi&s;e&s;t
and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lovers of liberty, had ever entru&s;ted
to their &s;enators the command of armies, and had main|tained
an unconquerable jealou&s;y of all mercenary forces:
And that tho&s;e alone who&s;e intere&s;t was involved in that
of the public, and who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a vote in the civil deli|berations,
would &s;ufficiently re&s;pect the authority of par|liament,
and never could be tempted to turn the &s;word
again&s;t tho&s;e, by whom it was committed to them<NOTE N="r" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 114, 115.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e rea&s;onings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Self-denying ordinance.</NOTE> a committee
was cho&s;en to frame what they called the <HI>&s;elf-denying
ordinance,</HI> by which the members of both hou&s;es were
excluded from all civil and military employments, ex|cept
<PB N="27" REF="45">
a few offices which were &s;pecified. This ordinance
was the &s;ubject of great debate, and, for a long time,
rent the whole parliament and city into factions. But,
at la&s;t, by the prevalence of envy with &s;ome; with
others, of fal&s;e mode&s;ty; with a great many, of the re|publican
and independent views; it pa&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e of
commons, and was &s;ent to the upper hou&s;e. The peers,
though the &s;cheme was, in part, levelled again&s;t their
order; though all of them were, at bottom, extremely
aver&s;e to it; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o little authority, that they dur&s;t
not oppo&s;e the re&s;olution of the commons; and they
thought it better policy, by an unlimited compliance, to
ward off that ruin, which they &s;aw approaching<NOTE N="s" PLACE="marg">Ru&s;h. vol. vii, p. 8, 15.</NOTE>. The
ordinance, therefore, having pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, E&s;&s;ex,
Warwic, Manche&s;ter, Denbigh, Waller, Brereton, and
many others, re&s;igned their commands, and received the
thanks of parliament for their good &s;ervices. A pen&s;ion
of ten thou&s;and pounds a year was &s;ettled on E&s;&s;ex.</P>
<P>It was agreed to recruit the army to 22,000 men;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1645.</NOTE> and
Sir Thomas Fairfax was appointed general<NOTE N="t" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 118. Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 7.</NOTE>. 'Tis re|markable,
that his commi&s;&s;ion did not run, like that of
E&s;&s;ex, in the name of the king and parliament, but in
that of the parliament alone: And the article of the &s;afe|ty
of the king's per&s;on was omitted. So much had the
animo&s;ities increa&s;ed between the parties<NOTE N="u" PLACE="marg">Whitlocke, p. 133.</NOTE>. Cromwel,
being a member of the lower hou&s;e, &s;hould have been
di&s;carded with the others; but this impartiality would
have di&s;appointed all the views of tho&s;e, who had intro|duced
the &s;elf-denying ordinance. He was &s;aved by a
&s;ubtilty, and by that political craft, in which he was &s;o
eminent. At the time, when the other officers re&s;igned
their commi&s;&s;ions, care was taken, that he &s;hould be &s;ent
with a body of hor&s;e, in order to relieve Taunton, be|&s;ieged

by the royali&s;ts. His ab&s;ence being remarked, or|ders
were di&s;patched for his immediate attendance in par|liament;
and the new general was directed to employ
&s;ome other officer in that &s;ervice. A ready compliance
was feigned; and the very day was named, on which, it
was averred, he would take his place in the hou&s;e. But
Fairfax having appointed a rendezvous of the army,
wrote to the parliament, and de&s;ired leave to retain, for
&s;ome days, Lieutenant-general Cromwel, who&s;e advice
he &s;aid, would be u&s;eful, in &s;upplying the place of tho&s;e
officers, who had re&s;igned. Shortly after, he begged,
with much earne&s;tne&s;s, that they would allow Cromwel
to &s;erve that campaign<NOTE N="w" PLACE="marg">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 629, 630. Whitlocke, p. 141.</NOTE>. And thus the independents,
tho' the minority, prevailed by art and cunning over the
pre&s;byterians, and be&s;towed the who lemilitary authority,
in appearance, upon Fairfax; in reality, upon Cromwel.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX was a per&s;on equally eminent for courage
and for humanity;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fairfax.</NOTE> and tho' &s;trongly infected with the
prejudices or principles, derived from religious and party-zeal,
he &s;eems never, in the cour&s;e of his public con|duct,
to have been &s;educed, by private intere&s;t or ambi|tion,
from adhering &s;trictly to the&s;e principles. Sincere
in his profe&s;&s;ions; di&s;intere&s;ted in his views; open in his
conduct; he had formed one of the mo&s;t &s;hining cha|racters
of that age; had not the extreme narrowne&s;s of
his genius, in every thing but in war, and his embarra&s;&s;ed
and confu&s;ed elocution, on every occa&s;ion but when he
gave orders, dimini&s;hed the lu&s;tre of his merit, and ren|dered
the part, which he acted, even when inve&s;ted with
the &s;upreme command, but &s;econdary and &s;ubordinate.</P>
<P>CROMWEL,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel.</NOTE> by who&s;e &s;agacity and in&s;inuation Fairfax

&s;trokes of his character are as open and &s;trongly marked,
<PB N="29" REF="49">
as the &s;chemes of his conduct were, during the time, dark
and impenetrable. His exten&s;ive capacity enabled him
to form the mo&s;t enlarged projects: His enterprizing ge|nius
was not di&s;mayed with the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t danger|ous.
Carried, by his natural temper, to magnanimity,
to grandeur, and to an imperious and domineering poli|cy;
he yet knew, when nece&s;&s;ary, to employ the mo&s;t
profound di&s;&s;imulation, the mo&s;t oblique and refined ar|tifice,
the &s;emblance of the greate&s;t moderation and &s;im|plicity.
A friend to ju&s;tice, tho' his public conduct was
one continued violation of it; devoted to religion, tho'
he perpetually employed it as the in&s;trument of his am|bition;
he was engaged in crimes from the pro&s;pect of
&s;overeign power, a temptation which is, in general, irre|&s;&s;itible
to human nature. And by u&s;ing well that au|thority,
which he attained by fraud and violence, he has

THE King, when he con&s;idered the propo&s;als and the
di&s;po&s;ition of the parliament, could not expect any ac|commodation,
and had no pro&s;pect but of war, or of
total &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and &s;ubjection: Yet, in order to &s;atisfy
his own party, who were extremely impatient for peace,
he agreed to &s;end the Duke of Richmond and Earl of
Southampton, with an an&s;wer to the parliament's propo|&s;als,
and at the &s;ame time to de&s;ire a treaty upon their
mutual demands and preten&s;ions<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 110.</NOTE>. It now became ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for him to retract his former declaration, that the
two hou&s;es at We&s;tmin&s;ter were not a free parliament;
and accordingly, he was induced, though with great re|luctance,
to give them, in his an&s;wer, the appellation of
the parliament of England<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 111. Dugdale, p. 748.</NOTE>. But it appeared after|wards,
by a letter, which he wrote to the Queen, and
of which a copy was taken at the battle of Na&s;eby, that
he &s;ecretly entered an explanatory prote&s;tation in his
council-book; and he pretended, tho' he had <HI>called</HI> them

<P>THE time and place of treaty were agreed on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Jan.</NOTE> and
accordingly &s;ixteen commi&s;&s;ioners from the King met at
Uxbridge with twelve authorized by the parliament, at|tended
with the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners. It was agreed that
the Scots and parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould give in
their demands with regard to three important articles,
<HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>Militia,</HI> and <HI>Ireland;</HI> and that the&s;e &s;hould

impracticable to come to any agreement with regard to
any of the&s;e articles.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ummer 1643, while the negotiations were car|ried
on with Scotland, the parliament had &s;ummoned an
a&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter, compo&s;ed of 121 divines and
30 laymen, celebrated in their party for piety and learn|ing.
By their advice, alterations were made in the
thirty-nine articles, or in the metaphy&s;ical doctrines of
the church; and, what was of greater importance, the
liturgy was entirely aboli&s;hed, and, in its place, a new
directory for wor&s;hip was e&s;tabli&s;hed; by which, &s;uitable
to the &s;pirit of the puritans, the utmo&s;t liberty, both in
praying and preaching, was indulged to the public
teachers. By the &s;olemn league and covenant, epi&s;co|pacy
was abjured, as de&s;tructive of all true piety; and
a national engagement, attended with every circum&s;tance,
which could render a promi&s;$ &s;acred and obligatory, was
entered into with the Scots, never to &s;uffer its re-admi&s;|&s;ion.
All the&s;e mea&s;ures &s;howed little &s;pirit of accom|modation in the parliament; and the King's commi&s;|&s;ioners
were not &s;urprized to find the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
<PB N="32" REF="54">
pre&s;bytery and the directory po&s;itively demanded, toge|ther
with the &s;ub&s;cription to the covenant, both by the
King and kingdom<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Such love of contradiction prevailed in the parliament, that they had con|verted Chri&s;tmas, which, with the churchmen, was a great fe&s;tival, into a &s;olemn fa&s;t and humiliation; &startq;In order,&endq; as they &s;aid, &startq;that it might call to remembrance our &s;ins and the &s;ins of our forefathers, who, pretending to celebrate the memory of Chri&s;t, have turned this fea&s;t into an extreme forgetfulne&s;s of him, by giving liberty to carnal and &s;en&s;ual delights.&endq; <HI>Ru&s;h.</HI> vol. vi. p. 817. 'Tis remarkable, that, as the parliament aboli&s;hed all holy days, and &s;everely prohibited all amu&s;ement on the Sabbath; and even burned, by the hands of the hangman, the King's book of &s;ports; the na|tion found, that there was no time left for relaxation or diver&s;ion. Upon ap|plication, therefore, of the &s;ervants and apprentices, the parliament appointed the &s;econd Tue&s;day of every month for play and recreation. <HI>Ru&s;h.</HI> vol. vii. p. 460. <HI>Whitelocke,</HI> p. 247. But the&s;e in&s;titutions, they found great difficulty to execute; and the people were re&s;olved to be merry when they plea&s;ed, not when the parliament &s;hould pre&s;cribe to them. The keeping of Chri&s;tmas holy-days was long a great mark of malignancy, and very &s;everely cen&s;ured by the commons. <HI>Whitelocke,</HI> p. 286. Even minced pyes, which cu&s;tom had made a Chri&s;tmas di&s;h among the churchmen, was regarded, during that &s;ea&s;on as a profane and &s;uper&s;titious viand by the &s;ectaries; tho' at other times it agreed very well with their &s;tomachs. In the parliamentary ordi|nance too, for the ob&s;ervance of the Sabbath, they in&s;erted a clau&s;e for the taking down of May-poles, which they called a heatheni&s;h vanity. Since we are upon this &s;ubject, it may not be ami&s;s to mention, that, be&s;ide &s;etting apart Sunday for the ordinances, as they called them, the godly had regular meetings on the Thur&s;days for re&s;olving ca&s;es of con&s;cience, and conferring about their progre&s;s in grace. What they were chiefly anxious about, was the fixing the preci&s;e moment of their conver&s;ion or new birth; and whoever could not a&s;certain &s;o difficult a point of calculation, could not pretend any title to &s;aint&s;hip. The profane &s;cholars at Oxford, after the parliament be|came ma&s;ters of that town, gave to the hou&s;e, in which the zealots a&s;&s;embled the denomination of <HI>Scruple-Shop:</HI> The zealots, in their turn, in&s;ulted the &s;cholars and profe&s;&s;ors; and, intruding into the place of lectures, declaime$ again&s;t human learning, and challenged the mo&s;t knowing of them to prov$ that their calling was from Chri&s;t. See Wood's Fa&s;ti Oxonien&s;is, p. 740.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD Charles been of a di&s;po&s;ition to neglect all theo|logical
controver&s;y; he yet had been obliged, in good
policy, to adhere to epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, not only be|cau&s;e
it was favourable to monarchy, but becau&s;e all his
<PB N="33" REF="55">
adherents were pa&s;&s;ionately devoted to it; and to abandon
them, in what they regarded as &s;o important an article,
was for ever to relinqui&s;h their friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.
But Charles had never attained &s;uch enlarged principles.
He e&s;teemed bi&s;hops e&s;&s;ential to the very being of a
chri&s;tian church; and he thought him&s;elf bound, by
more &s;acred ties, than tho&s;e of policy, or even of ho|nour,
to the &s;upport of that order. His conce&s;&s;ions
therefore, on this head, he judged &s;uffcient, when he
agreed, that an indulgence &s;hould be given to tender
con&s;ciences with regard to ceremonies; that the bi&s;hops
&s;hould exerci&s;e no act of juri&s;diction or ordination, with|out
the con&s;ent and council of &s;uch pre&s;byters as &s;hould
be cho&s;en by the clergy of each dioce&s;e; that they &s;hould
re&s;ide con&s;tantly in their dioce&s;e, and be bound to preach
every Sunday; that pluralities be aboli&s;hed; that abu&s;es
in eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts be redre&s;&s;ed; and that a hundred
thou&s;and pounds be levied from the bi&s;hop's e&s;tates and
the chapter lands, for payment of debts contracted by the
parliament<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 779, 780.</NOTE>. The&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, tho' con&s;iderable, gave
no &s;atisfaction to the parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners; and,
without abating any thing of their rigor on this head,
they proceeded to their demands with regard to the mi|litia.</P>
<P>THE king's partizans had all along maintained, that
the fears and jealou&s;ies of the parliament, after the &s;ecu|rities
&s;o early and ea&s;ily given to public liberty, were
either feigned or groundle&s;s; and that no human in&s;titu|tion
could be better poized and adju&s;ted, than was now
the government of England. By the abolition of the
&s;tar-chamber and court of high commi&s;&s;ion, the prero|gative,
they &s;aid, has lo&s;t all that coercive power, by
which it had formerly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed or endangered liberty:
By the e&s;tabli&s;hment of triennial parliaments, it can have
<PB N="34" REF="56">
no lei&s;ure to acquire new powers, or guard it&s;elf, during
any time, from the in&s;pection of that vigilant a&s;&s;embly:
By the &s;lender revenue of the crown, no king can ever
attain &s;uch influence as to procure a repeal of the&s;e &s;alu|tary
&s;tatutes: and while the prince commands no mer|cenary
forces, he will in vain, by violence, attempt an
infringement of laws, &s;o clearly defined by means of
late di&s;putes, and &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately cheri&s;hed by all his &s;ub|jects.
In this &s;ituation &s;urely, the nation, governed by
&s;o virtuous a monarch, may, for the pre&s;ent, remain in
tranquility, and try, whether it be not po&s;&s;ible, by peace|ful
arts, to elude that danger, with which, it is pretend|ed,
its liberties are &s;till threatened.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the royali&s;ts in&s;i&s;ted on the&s;e plau&s;ible topics,
before the commencement of the war, they were obliged
to own, that the progre&s;s of civil commotions had &s;ome|what
abated the force and evidence of this rea&s;oning.
If the power of the militia, &s;aid the oppo&s;ite party, be
entru&s;ted to the King, it were not now difficult for him to
abu&s;e that authority. By the rage of inte&s;tine di&s;cord, his
partizans are enflamed into an extreme hatred again&s;t
their antagoni&s;ts; and have contracted, no doubt, &s;ome
prejudices again&s;t popular privileges, which, in their ap|prehen&s;ion,
have been the &s;ource of &s;o much mi&s;chief.
Were the arms of the &s;tate, therefore, put entirely into
&s;uch hands; what public &s;ecurity, it may be demanded,
can be given to liberty, or what private &s;ecurity to tho&s;e,
who, in oppo&s;ition to the letter of the law, have &s;o ge|nerou&s;ly
ventured their lives in its defence? In compli|ance
with this apprehen&s;ion, Charles offered, that the
arms of the &s;tate &s;hould be entru&s;ted, during three years,
to twenty commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hould be named, either
by common agreement between him and the parliament,
or the one half by him, the other by the parliament.
And, after the expiration of that term, he in&s;i&s;ted, that
<PB N="35" REF="57">
his con&s;titutional authority over the militia &s;hould again
return to him<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 798.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners at fir&s;t demanded,
that the power of the &s;word &s;hould for ever be entru&s;ted
to &s;uch per&s;ons, as the parliament alone &s;hould ap|point<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 791.</NOTE>:
But afterwards, they relaxed &s;o far, as to re|quire
that authority only for &s;even years; after which,
it was not to return to the king, but to be &s;ettled by
bill, or by common agreement between him and his par|liament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 820</NOTE>.
The King's commi&s;&s;ioners a&s;ked, Whether
jealou&s;ies and fears were all on one &s;ide, and whether the
prince, from &s;uch violent attempts and preten&s;ions as he
had experienced, had not, at lea&s;t, equal rea&s;on to ap|prehend
for his authority, as they for their liberty?
Whether there was any equity, in &s;ecuring only one
party, and leaving the other, during the cour&s;e of &s;even
years, entirely at the mercy of their enemies? Whether,
if unlimited power was entru&s;ted to the parliament during
&s;o long a period, it would not be ea&s;y for them to frame
the &s;ub&s;equent bill in the manner mo&s;t agreeable to them|&s;elves,
and keep for ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;word, as well
as of every article of civil power and juri&s;diction<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 877.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>THE truth is, after the commencement of the war, it
was very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to find &s;ecurity for
both parties, e&s;pecially for that of the parliament. Amid&s;t
&s;uch violent animo&s;ities, power alone could en&s;ure &s;afe|ty;
and the power of one &s;ide was nece&s;&s;arily attended
with the danger of the other. Few or no in&s;tances occur
in hi&s;tory of an equal, peaceful, and durable accommo|dation,
that has been concluded between two factions,
which have been inflamed into civil war.</P>
<P>WITH regard to Ireland, there were no greater hopes
of agreement between the parties. The Parliament de|manded,
<PB N="36" REF="58">
That the ce&s;&s;ation with the rebels &s;hould be
declared null; that the management of the war &s;hould
be given over entirely to the parliament; and that after
the conque&s;t of Ireland, the nomination of the Lord
lieutenant and of the judges, or in other words, the &s;o|vereignty
of that kingdom, &s;hould likewi&s;e remain in
their hands<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 826, 827.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT rendered a peaceful accommodation &s;till more
de&s;perate: The demands on the&s;e three heads, however
exorbitant, were acknowledged, by the parliamentary
commi&s;&s;ioners, to be nothing but preliminaries. Were
all the&s;e granted, they &s;till re&s;erved the power of reviving
tho&s;e other demands, &s;till more exorbitant, which, a
little before, had been tran&s;mitted to the King at Ox|ford.
Such ignominious terms were there in&s;i&s;ted on,
as wor&s;e could &s;carcely be demanded, were Charles to|tally
vanqui&s;hed, a pri&s;oner, and in chains. The King
was required to attaint and exempt from a general par|don,
forty of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of his Engli&s;h &s;ub|jects,
and nineteen of his Scots, together with all popi&s;h
recu&s;ants in both kingdoms, who had borne arms for
him. It was in&s;i&s;ted, that forty-eight more, with all
members who had &s;at in either hou&s;e at Oxford, all
lawyers and divines who had embraced the King's party,
&s;hould be rendered incapable of any office, be forbid
the exerci&s;e of their profe&s;&s;ion, be prohibited from
coming within the verge of the court, and forfeit the
third of their e&s;tates to the parliament. It was re|quired,
that whoever had borne arms for the King, &s;hould
forfeit the tenth part of their e&s;tates, or if that did not
&s;uffice, the &s;ixth, for the payment of public debts. As
if the royal authority were not &s;ufficiently annihilated by
&s;uch terms, it was demanded, that the court of wards
&s;hould be aboli&s;ed; that all the con&s;iderable officers of
the crown, and all the judges, &s;hould be appointed by
<PB N="37" REF="59">
parliament; and that the right of peace and war &s;hould
not be exerci&s;ed without the con&s;ent of that a&s;&s;embly<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 850. Dugdale, p. 737.</NOTE>.
The pre&s;byterians, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, after in&s;i&s;ting
on &s;uch conditions, differed only in words, from the in|dependents,
who required the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a pure re|public.
When the debates had been carried on to no
purpo&s;e, during twenty days, among the commi&s;&s;ioners,
they &s;eparated, and returned; tho&s;e of the King, to
Oxford, tho&s;e of the parliament, to London.</P>
<P>A little before the commencement of this fruitle&s;s
treaty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of Laud.</NOTE> a deed was executed by the parliament, which
proved their determined re&s;olution to yield nothing, but
to proceed in the &s;ame violent and imperious manner,
with which they had, at fir&s;t, entered on the&s;e danger|ous
enterprizes. Archbi&s;hop Laud, the mo&s;t favoured
mini&s;ter of the king, was brought to the &s;caffold; and
in this in&s;tance, the public might &s;ee, that popular a&s;|&s;emblies,
as, by their very number, they are, in a great
mea&s;ure, exempt from the re&s;traint of &s;hame, &s;o, when
they al&s;o overleap the bounds of law, naturally break
out into acts of the greate&s;t tyranny and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>FROM the time, that Laud had been committed, the
hou&s;e of commons, engaged in enterprizes of greater
moment, had found no lei&s;ure to fini&s;h his impeach|ment;
and he had patiently endured &s;o long an impri&s;on|ment
without being brought to any trial. After the
union with Scotland, the bigotted prejudices of that na|tion
revived the like &s;pirit in England; and the &s;ectaries
re&s;olved to gratify their vengeance in the puni&s;hment of
this prelate, who had &s;o long, by his authority, and by
the execution of penal laws, kept their zealous &s;pirit
under confinement. He was accu&s;ed of high trea&s;on, in
endeavouring to &s;ubvert the fundamental laws, and of
other high crimes and mi&s;demeanors. The &s;ame illega|lity
of an accumulative crime and a con&s;tructive evi|dence,
<PB N="38" REF="60">
which appeared in the ca&s;e of Strafford; the
&s;ame violence and iniquity in conducting the trial, are
con&s;picuous through the whole cour&s;e of this pro&s;ecu|tion.
The groundle&s;s charge of popery, which was be|lied
by his whole life and conduct, was continually urged
again&s;t the pri&s;oner; and every error rendered unpardon|able
by this imputation, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to imply
the height of all enormities. &startq;This man, my lords,&endq;
&s;aid &s;erjeant Wilde, concluding his long &s;peech again&s;t
him, &startq;is like Naaman the Syrian; a great man, but a
leper<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h vol. vi. p. 830.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>WE &s;hall not enter into a detail of this matter, which,
at pre&s;ent, &s;eems to admit of &s;o little controver&s;y. It
&s;uffices to &s;ay, that after a long trial, and the examina|tion
of above a hundred and fifty witne&s;&s;es, the commons
found &s;o little likelihood of obtaining a judicial &s;entence
again&s;t Laud, that they were obliged to have recour&s;e to
their legi&s;lative authority, and to pa&s;s an ordinance for
taking away the life of this aged prelate. Notwith&s;tand|ing
the low condition, into which the hou&s;e of peers
were fallen, there appeared &s;ome intention of rejecting
this ordinance; and the popular leaders were again ob|liged
to apply to the multitude, and to extingui&s;h, by
threats of new tumults, the &s;mall remains of liberty,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the upper hou&s;e. Seven peers alone voted
in this important que&s;tion. The re&s;t, either from &s;hame
or fear, took care to ab&s;ent them&s;elves<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 169.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LAUD, who had behaved during his trial with great
&s;pirit and vigor of genius, &s;unk not under the horrors of
his execution; but tho' he u&s;ually profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ap|prehen&s;ive
of a violent death, he found all his fears to di&s;|&s;ipate
before that &s;uperior courage, by which he was
animated. &startq;No one,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;can be more willing
to &s;end me out of life, than I am de&s;irous to go.&endq;
<PB N="39" REF="61">
Even upon the &s;caffold, and during the intervals of his
prayers, he was harra&s;&s;ed and mole&s;ted by Sir John Clot|worthy,
a zealot of the reigning &s;ect, and a great leader
in the lower hou&s;e: This was the time he cho&s;e for ex|amining
the principles of the dying primate, and tra|paning
him into a confe&s;&s;ion, that he tru&s;ted, for his &s;al|vation,
to the merits of good works, not to the death
of the Redeemer<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 838, 839.</NOTE>. Having extricated him&s;elf from
the&s;e theological toils, the Archbi&s;hop laid his head on
the block; and it was &s;evered from the body by one
blow<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">12th of July.</NOTE>. Tho&s;e theological opinions, for which he &s;uf|fered,
contributed, no doubt, to the courage and con|&s;tancy
of his end. Sincere, he undoubtedly was, and,
however mi&s;guided, actuated by religious motives in all
his pur&s;uits; and it is to be regretted that a man of &s;uch
&s;pirit, who conducted his enterprizes with &s;o much
warmth and indu&s;try, had not entertained more enlarged
views, and embraced principles more favourable to the
general happine&s;s of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE great and important advantage, which the party
gained by Strafford's death, may in &s;ome degree, pal|liate
the iniquity of the &s;entence pronounced again&s;t
him: But the execution of this old infirm prelate, who

That he de&s;erved a better fate was not que&s;|tioned
by any rea&s;onable man: The degree of his merit
was, in other re&s;pects, much di&s;puted. Some accu&s;ed
him of recommending &s;lavi&s;h doctrines, of promoting
per&s;ecution, and of encouraging &s;uper&s;tition; while

<P>THAT the <HI>letter</HI> of the law, as much as the mo&s;t

very apparent: And tho' the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of a limited govern|ment

<P>TOLERATION had hitherto been &s;o little the principle

not obtain from the Engli&s;h the lea&s;t indulgence. This
very hou&s;e of commons, in their famous remon&s;trance,
took care to ju&s;tify them&s;elves, as from the highe&s;t im|putation,
of any intention to relax the golden reins of
di&s;cipline, as they called them, or grant any toleration<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 705.</NOTE>,
And the enemies of the church were &s;o fair from the
beginning, as not to lay claim to liberty of con&s;cience,
which they called a toleration for &s;oul murder. They
openly challenged the &s;uperiority, and even menaced the
e&s;tabli&s;hed church with that per&s;ecution, which they af|terwards
exerci&s;ed again&s;t it with &s;uch &s;everity. And if
the que&s;tion be con&s;idered in the view of policy; tho' a
&s;ect, already formed and advanced, may, with good rea|&s;on,
demand a toleration; what title had the puritans to
this indulgence, who were ju&s;t on the point of &s;epara|tion
from the church, and whom, it might be hoped,
&s;ome whol&s;ome and legal &s;everities would &s;till retain in
their obedience to it<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">That Laud's &s;everity was not extreme, appears from this fact, that he cau&s;ed the acts or records of the high commi&s;&s;ion-court to be &s;earched, and found that there had been fewer &s;u&s;pen&s;ions, deprivations, and other puni&s;h|ments, by three, during the &s;even years of his time, than in any &s;even years of his predece&s;&s;or Abbot; who was notwith&s;tanding in great e&s;teem with the hou&s;e of commons. <HI>Troubles and trials of Laud,</HI> p. 164. But Abbot was little attached to the court, and was al&s;o a puritan in doctrine, and bore a mortal hatred to the papi&s;ts. Not to mention, that the mutinous &s;pirit was ri&s;ing higher in the time of Laud, and would le&s;s bear controul. The maxims, however, of his admini&s;tration were the &s;ame which had ever prevailed in England, and which had place in every other European nation, except Hol|land, which &s;tudied chiefly the intere&s;ts of commerce, and France, which was fetter'd by edicts and treaties. To have changed them for the modern maxims of toleration, however rea&s;onable, would have been deemed a very bold and dangerous enterprize. It is a principle, advanced by pre&s;ident Mon|te&s;quieu, that, where the magi&s;trate is &s;atisfy'd with the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Religion, he ought to repre&s;s the fir&s;t attempts towards innovation, and only grant a toleration to &s;ects that are diffus'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd. See l'E&s;prit des Loix, Liv. 25. chap. 10. According to this principle, Laud's indulgence to the Ca|tholics, and &s;everity to the puritans, would admit of apology. I own, how|ever, that it is very que&s;tionable, whether per&s;ecution can in any ca&s;e be ju&s;tify'd.</NOTE>?</P>

WHATEVER ridicule, to a philo&s;ophical mind, may
be thrown on pious ceremonies, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd,
that, during a very religious age, no in&s;titution can be
more advantageous to the rude multitude, and tend more
to mollify that fierce and gloomy &s;pirit of devotion, to
which they are &s;ubject. Even the Engli&s;h church, tho'
it had retained a &s;hare of popi&s;h ceremonies, may ju&s;tly
be thought too naked and unadorned, and &s;till to approach
too near the ab&s;tract and &s;piritual religion of the puritans.
Laud and his a&s;&s;ociates, by reviving a few primitive in|&s;titutions
of this nature, corrected the error of the fir&s;t
reformers, and pre&s;ented, to the affrightened and a&s;toni&s;h|ed
mind, &s;ome &s;en&s;ible, exterior ob&s;ervances, which
might occupy it during its religious exerci&s;es, and abate
the violence of its di&s;appointed efforts. The thought,
no longer bent on that divine and my&s;terious E&s;&s;ence, &s;o
&s;uperior to the narrow capacities of mankind, was able,
by means of the new model of devotion, to relax it&s;elf in
the contemplation of pictures, po&s;tures, ve&s;tments, build|ings;
and all the fine arts, which mini&s;tred to religion,
thereby received additional encouragement. The primate,
<PB N="42" REF="64">
'tis true, conducted this &s;cheme, not with the enlarged
&s;entiments and cool di&s;po&s;ition of a legi&s;lator, but with
the intemperate zeal of a &s;ectary; and by over-looking
the circum&s;tances of the times, &s;erved rather to inflame
that religious fury, which he meant to repre&s;s. But this
blemi&s;h is more to be regarded as a general imputation
on the whole age, than any particular failing of Laud;
and 'tis &s;ufficient for his vindication to ob&s;erve, that his
errors were the mo&s;t excu&s;able of all tho&s;e which pre|vailed

<P>BEFORE the commencement of the&s;e civil di&s;orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montro&s;e's victories.</NOTE>
the Earl of Montro&s;e, a young nobleman of a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
family, returning from his travels, had been in|troduced
to the King, and had made an offer of his &s;er|vices;
but by the in&s;inuations of the Marque&s;s, after|wards
Duke of Hamilton, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed much of
Charles's confidence, he had not been received with that
di&s;tinction, to which he thought him&s;elf ju&s;tly intitled<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, Intr. p. 63.</NOTE>.
Di&s;gu&s;ted with this treatment, he had forwarded all
the violence of the covenanters; and agreeable to the
natural ardour of his genius, he had employed him&s;elf,
during the fir&s;t in&s;urrection, with great zeal as well as
&s;ucce&s;s, in levying and conducting their armies. Being
commi&s;&s;ioned by the <HI>Tables</HI> to wait upon the King, while
the royal army lay at Berwic, he was &s;o won upon by
the civilities and care&s;&s;es of that monarch, that he thence|forth
devoted him&s;elf intirely, though &s;ecretly, to his
&s;ervice, and entred into a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence with him.
In the &s;econd Scotti&s;h in&s;urrection, a great military
command was entru&s;ted to him by the covenanters; and
he was the fir&s;t who pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed, at the head of

their troops, in the inva&s;ion of England. He found
means, however, &s;oon after to convey a letter to the
King: And by the infidelity of &s;ome about that Prince;
Hamilton, as was by &s;ome &s;u&s;pected; a copy of this let|ter
was &s;ent to Leven the Scots general. Being ac|cu&s;ed
of treachery, and a corre&s;pondence with the ene|my,
Montro&s;e openly avowed the letter; and a&s;ked the
generals, if they dared to call their &s;overeign an enemy:
And by this bold and magnanimous behaviour, he
e&s;caped the danger of an immediate pro&s;ecution. As he
was now fully known to be of the royal party, he no
longer concealed his principles; and he endeavoured to
draw tho&s;e, who had entertained like &s;entiments, into a
bond of a&s;&s;ociation for his ma&s;ter's &s;ervice. Though
thrown into pri&s;on for this enterprize<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">It is not improper to take notice of a mi&s;take committed by Clarendon, much to the di&s;advantage of this gallant Nobleman; that he offered the King, when his Maje&s;ty was in Scotland, to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate Argyle. All the time the King was in Scotland, Montro&s;e was confined to pri&s;on. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 980.</NOTE>, and detained
&s;ome time, he was not di&s;couraged; but &s;till continued, by his countenance and protection, to infu&s;e &s;pirit into
the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed royali&s;ts. Among other per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion,
who united them&s;elves to him, was the Lord Na|pier
of Merchi&s;ton, &s;on to the famous inventor of the
logarithms, the per&s;on to whom the title of a GREAT
MAN is more ju&s;tly due, than to any other, whom his
country ever produced.</P>
<P>THERE was in Scotland another party, who, profe&s;|&s;ing
equal attachment to the King's &s;ervice, pretended
only to differ with Montro&s;e about the means of attain|ing
the &s;ame end; and of this party, Duke Hamilton
was the leader. That Nobleman had cau&s;e to be ex|tremely
devoted to the King, not only by rea&s;on of the
connexion of blood, which united him to the royal fa|mily;
but on account of the great confidence and fa|vour
with which he had ever been honoured by his
ma&s;ter. Being accu&s;ed by Lord Rae, not without &s;ome
<PB N="45" REF="69">
appearance or probability, of a con&s;piracy again&s;t the
King; Charles was &s;o far from harbouring &s;u&s;picion
again&s;t him, that, the very fir&s;t time Hamilton came to
court, he received him into his bed-chamber, and pa&s;&s;ed
alone the night with him<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Nal&s;on, vol. ii. p. 683.</NOTE>. But &s;uch was the Duke's
unhappy fate or conduct, that he e&s;caped not the impu|tation
of treachery to his friend and &s;overeign; and
though he at la&s;t &s;acrificed his life in the King's &s;ervice,
his integrity and &s;incerity have not been thought by hi&s;|torians
intirely free from blemi&s;h. Perhaps, (and this
is the mo&s;t probable opinion) the &s;ubtilties and refine|ments
of his conduct and his temporizing maxims, tho'
accompanied with good intentions, have been the chief
cau&s;e of a &s;u&s;picion, which has never yet been either
fully proved or refuted. As much as the bold and vivid
&s;pirit of Montro&s;e prompted him to enterprizing mea|&s;ures,
as much was the cautious temper of Hamilton in|clined
to &s;uch as were moderate and dilatory. While
the former foretold, that the Scots covenanters were &s;e|cretly
forming an union with the Engli&s;h parliament,
and inculcated the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing them by &s;ome
vigorous undertaking; the latter &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that every
&s;uch attempt would precipitate them into mea&s;ures, to
which, otherwi&s;e, they were not, perhaps, inclined.
After the Scots parliament was &s;ummoned without the
King's authority, the former exclaimed, that their in|tentions
were now vi&s;ible, and that if &s;ome unexpected
blow was not &s;truck, to di&s;&s;ipate them, they would arm
the whole nation again&s;t the King; the latter maintained
the po&s;&s;ibility of outvoting the di&s;affected party, and &s;e|curing,
by peaceful means, the allegiance of the Scots
nation<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iii. p. 380, 381. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 980. Wi&s;hart, cap. 2.</NOTE>. Unhappily for the royal cau&s;e, Hamilton's
repre&s;entations met with more credit from the King and
Queen, than tho&s;e of Montro&s;e; and the covenanters
<PB N="46" REF="70">
were allowed, without interruption, to proceed in all
their ho&s;tile mea&s;ures. Montro&s;e then ha&s;tened to Ox|ford;
where his invectives again&s;t Hamilton's treachery,
concurring with the general prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and &s;upported
by the unfortunate event of his councils, were entertain|ed
with univer&s;al approbation. Influenced by the clam|our
of his party, more than his own &s;u&s;picions, Charles,
&s;o &s;oon as Hamilton appeared, &s;ent him pri&s;oner to Pen|dennis
ca&s;tle in Cornwall. His brother, Laneric, who
was al&s;o put under confinement, found means to make
his e&s;cape, and fly into Scotland.</P>
<P>THE King's ears were now open to Montro&s;e's coun|cils,
who propo&s;ed none but the bolde&s;t and mo&s;t daring,
agreeable to the de&s;perate &s;tate of the royal cau&s;e in
Scotland. Though the whole nation was occupied by
the covenanters, though great armies were kept on foot
by them, and every place guarded by a vigilant admini|&s;tration;
he undertook, by his own credit, and that of
the few friends, who remained to the King, to rai&s;e &s;uch
commotions, as would &s;oon oblige the male-contents to
recal tho&s;e forces, which had &s;o &s;en&s;ibly thrown the ba|lance
in favour of the parliament<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;hart, cap. 3.</NOTE>. Not di&s;couraged
with the defeat at Mar&s;ton moor, which rendered it im|po&s;&s;ible
for him to draw any &s;uccour from England; he
was contented to &s;tipulate with the Earl of Antrim, a
Nobleman of Ireland, for &s;ome &s;upply of men from that
country. And he him&s;elf, changing his di&s;gui&s;es and
pa&s;&s;ing through many dangers, arrived in Scotland;
where he lay concealed in the borders of the Highlands,
and &s;ecretly prepared the minds of his partizans for the
attempting &s;ome great enterprize<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 618. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 982. Wi&s;hart, cap. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner were the Iri&s;h landed, though not exceed|ing
eleven hundred foot, very ill armed, than Montro&s;e
declared him&s;elf, and entered upon that &s;cene of action,
<PB N="47" REF="71">
which has rendered his name &s;o celebrated. About eight
hundred of the men of Athole flocked to his &s;tandard.
Five hundred men more, who had been levied by the
covenanters, were per&s;uaded to embrace the royal cau&s;e:
And with this combined force, he ha&s;tened to attack
Lord Elcho, who lay at Perth with an army of 6000
men, a&s;&s;embled upon the fir&s;t news of the Iri&s;h inva&s;ion.
Montro&s;e, inferior in number, totally unprovided of
hor&s;e, ill &s;upplied with arms and ammunition, had no|thing
to depend on, but the courage, which he him&s;elf,
by his own example, and the rapidity of his enterprizes,
&s;hould in&s;pire into his raw &s;oldiers. Having received the
fire of the enemy, which was an&s;wered chiefly with a
volley of &s;tones, he ru&s;hed amid&s;t them with his &s;word
drawn, threw them into confu&s;ion, pu&s;hed his advantage,
and obtained a complete victory, with the &s;laughter of
two thou&s;and of the covenanters<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1&s;t of September 1644. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 983. Wi&s;hart, cap. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS victory, though it augmented the renown of
Montro&s;e, increa&s;ed not his power nor numbers. The
far greater part of the kingdom were extremely attached
to the covenant; and &s;uch as bore an affection to the
royal cau&s;e, were terrified by the e&s;tabli&s;hed authority of
the oppo&s;ite party. Dreading the &s;uperior power of
Argyle, who, having joined his va&s;&s;als to a force levied
by the public, was approaching with a con&s;iderable
army; Montro&s;e ha&s;tened northwards, in order to rouze
again the Marque&s;s of Huntley and the Gordons, who,
having before ha&s;tily taken arms, had been in&s;tantly &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
by the covenanters. He was joined on his march
by the Earl of Airly, with his two younger &s;ons, Sir
Thomas and Sir David Ogilvy: The elde&s;t was, at that
time, a pri&s;oner with the enemy. He attacked at Aber|deen
the Lord Burley, who commanded a force of 2500
men. After a &s;harp combat, by his undaunted courage,
<PB N="48" REF="72">
which, his &s;ituation, was true policy, and was al&s;o
not unaccompanied with military &s;kill, he put the ene|my
to flight, and in the pur&s;uit did great execution upon
them<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">11th of September 1644. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 983. Wi&s;hart, cap. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT by this &s;econd advantage, he obtained not the
end, which he propo&s;ed. The envious nature of Hunt|ly,
jealous of Montro&s;e's glory, rendered him aver&s;e to
join an army, where he him&s;elf mu&s;t be &s;o much eclip&s;ed
by the &s;uperior merit of the general. Argyle, re-inforced
by the Earl of Lothian, was behind him with a great
army: The militia of the northern counties, Murray,
Ro&s;s, Caithne&s;s, to the number of 5000, oppo&s;ed him
in front, and guarded the banks of the Spey, a deep and
rapid river. In order to elude the&s;e numerous armies,
he turned a&s;ide into the hills, and &s;aved his weak, but
active troops, in Badenoch. After &s;ome marches and
counter-marches, Argyle came up with him at Faivy-ca&s;tle.
This Nobleman's character, though celebrated
for political courage and conduct, was very low for mi|litary
prowe&s;s; and after &s;ome &s;kirmi&s;hes, in which he
was wor&s;ted, he here allowed Montro&s;e to e&s;cape him.
By quick marches, through the&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible mountains,
that general freed him&s;elf from the &s;uperior forces of the
covenanters.</P>
<P>SUCH was the &s;ituation of Montro&s;e, that very good
or very ill fortune was equally de&s;tructive to him, and
dimini&s;hed his army. After every victory, his &s;oldiers,
greedy of &s;poil, but deeming the &s;malle&s;t acqui&s;ition to
be unexhau&s;ted riches, de&s;erted in great numbers, and
went home to &s;ecure the trea&s;ures, which they had ac|quired.
Tired too, and &s;pent with ha&s;ty and long
marches, in the depth of winter, through &s;nowy moun|tains,
unprovided of every nece&s;&s;ary, they fell off, and
left their general almo&s;t alone with the Iri&s;h who, hav|ing
<PB N="49" REF="73">
no place to which they could retire, &s;till adhered to
him in every fortune.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e, and &s;ome reinforcement of the Athole|men,
and Macdonalds whom he had recalled, Montro&s;e
fell &s;uddenly upon Argyle's country, and let loo&s;e upon
it the whole rage of war; carrying off the cattle, burn|ing
the hou&s;es, and putting the inhabitants to the &s;word.
This &s;everity, by which Montro&s;e &s;ullied his victories,
was the re&s;ult of private animo&s;ity again&s;t the chieftain,
as much as of zeal for the public cau&s;e. Argyle, col|lecting
three thou&s;and men, marched in que&s;t of the ene|my,
who had retired with their plunder; and he lay at
Innerlochy, &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf &s;till at a con&s;iderable di&s;|tance
from them. The Earl of Seaforth, at the head
of the garri&s;on of Inverne&s;s, who were veteran &s;oldiers,
joined to 5000 new levied troops of the northern coun|ties,
pre&s;&s;ed the royali&s;ts on the other &s;ide, and threaten|ed
them with inevitable de&s;truction. By a quick and
unexpected march, Montro&s;e ha&s;tened to Innerlochy,
and pre&s;ented him&s;elf in order of battle, before the &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
but not affrighted, covenanters. Argyle alone,
&s;eized with a panic, de&s;erted his army,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Feb.</NOTE> who &s;till main|tained
their ground, and gave battle to the royali&s;ts.
After a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance, they were defeated, and pur|&s;ued
with great &s;laughter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 985. Wi&s;hart, cap. 8.</NOTE>. And the power of the
Campbels (that is Argyle's name) being thus broke;
the highlanders, who were in general well-affected to
the royal cau&s;e, began to join Montro&s;e's camp, in great
numbers. Seaforth's army di&s;per&s;ed of it&s;elf, at the very
terror of his name. And the Lord Gordon, elde&s;t &s;on
to Huntley, having escaped from his uncle Argyle, who
had hitherto detained him, now joined Montro&s;e, with
no contemptible number of his followers, attended by
his brother the Earl of Aboine.</P>

THE council at Edinburgh, alarmed at Montro&s;e's
progre&s;s, began to think of a more regular plan of de|fence,
again&s;t an enemy, who&s;e repeated victories had
rendered him extremely formidable. They &s;ent for
Baillie, an officer of reputation from England; and join|ing
him in command with Urrey, who had again inli&s;ted
him&s;elf among the King's enemies, they &s;ent them to the
field, with a con&s;iderable army, again&s;t the royali&s;ts.
Montro&s;e, with a detachment of 800 men, had attacked
Dundee, a town extremely zealous for the covenant:
And having carried it by a&s;&s;ault, had delivered it up to
be plundered by his &s;oldiers; when Baillie and Urrey,
with their whole force, were unexpectedly upon him<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 228. Wi&s;hart, cap. 9.</NOTE>.
His conduct and pre&s;ence of mind, in this emergence,
appeared con&s;picuous. In&s;tantly he called off his &s;ol|diers
from plunder, put them in order, &s;ecured his re|treat
by the mo&s;t &s;kilful mea&s;ures; and having marched
&s;ixty miles in the face of an enemy much &s;uperior, with|out
&s;topping, or allowing his &s;oldiers the lea&s;t &s;leep or

<P>BAILLIE and Urrey now divided their troops, in order

&s;urpri&s;ed them, as much by the rapidity of his marches,
as by the boldne&s;s of his enterprizes. Urrey, at the
head of 4000 men, met him at Alderne, near Inverne&s;s;
and, encouraged by the &s;uperiority of number (for the
covenanters were double the royali&s;ts,) attacked him in
the po&s;t which he had cho&s;en. Montro&s;e, having placed
his right wing in very &s;trong ground, drew the be&s;t of
his forces to the other, and left no main body between
them; a defect which he artfully concealed, by &s;howing
a few men thro' the trees and bu&s;hes, with which that
ground was covered. That Urrey might have no lei&s;ure
to perceive the &s;tratagem, he in&s;tantly led his left wing
<PB N="51" REF="77">
to the attack; and, making a furious impre&s;&s;ion upon
the covenanters, drove them off the field, and obtained
a compleat victory<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 229. Wi&s;hart, cap. 10.</NOTE>. In this battle, the valour of young

<P>BAILLIE now advanced, in order to revenge Urrey's
di&s;comfiture; but, at Alford, he met him&s;elf with a like
fate<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">2d of July.</NOTE>. Montro&s;e, weak in cavalry, lined his troops of
hor&s;e with infantry; and after putting the enemies hor&s;e
to rout, fell with united force upon their infantry, which
were entirely cut in pieces, though with the lo&s;s of the
gallant Lord Gordon on the part of the royali&s;ts<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 229. Wi&s;hart, cap. 11.</NOTE>. And
having thus prevailed in &s;o many battles, which his vig|our
ever rendered as deci&s;ive as they were &s;ucce&s;sful; he
&s;ummoned together all his friends and confederates, and
prepared him&s;elf for marching into the &s;outhern pro|vinces,
in order to put a total period to the power of the
covenanters, and di&s;&s;ipate the parliament, which, with
great pomp and &s;olemnity, they had a&s;&s;embled at St.
John&s;ton's.</P>
<P>WHILE the fire was thus kindled in the north of the
i&s;land, it blazed out with no le&s;s fury in the &s;outh; and
the parliamentary and royal armies, as &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on

Fairfax, or more properly &s;peaking, Cromwel under his
name, introduced, at la&s;t, the <HI>new model</HI> into the army,
and threw the whole troops into a different &s;hape. From
the &s;ame men, new regiments and new companies were
formed, different officers appointed, and the whole mi|litary
force put into &s;uch hands, as the independents
could rely on. Be&s;ides members of parliament who were
excluded, many officers unwilling to &s;erve under the
new generals, threw up their commi&s;&s;ions; and unwa|rily
facilitated the project of putting the army entirely
into the hands of that &s;action.</P>
<P>THOUGH the di&s;cipline of the former parliamentary
army was not contemptible, a more exact plan was in|troduced,
and rigorou&s;ly executed, by the&s;e new com|manders.
Valour indeed was very generally diffu&s;ed
over the one party as well as the other, during this pe|riod:
Di&s;cipline al&s;o was attained by the forces of the
parliament: But the perfection of the military art, in
concerting the general plans of action, and the opera|tions
of the field, &s;eems &s;till, on both &s;ides, to have
been, in a great mea&s;ure, wanting. Hi&s;torians at lea&s;t,
perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience,
have not remarked any thing but a headlong impetuous
conduct; each party hurrying to a battle, where valour
and fortune chiefly determined the &s;ucce&s;s. The great
ornament of hi&s;tory, during the&s;e reigns, are the civil,
not the military tran&s;actions.</P>

all the intervals of action, they occupied them&s;elves
in &s;ermons, prayers, exhortations; and the &s;ame emu|lation,
there, attended them, which, in the field, is &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the honour of that profe&s;&s;ion. Rap|turous
ec&s;ta&s;ies &s;upplied the place of &s;tudy and reflection;
and while the zealous devotees poured out their thoughts
in unpremeditated harangues, they mi&s;took that elo|quence,
which, to their own &s;urprize, as well as that
of others, flowed in upon them, for divine illuminations,
and for illap&s;es of the Holy Spirit. Wherever they were
quartered, they excluded the mini&s;ter from his pulpit;
and, mounting that tribunal, conveyed their &s;entiments
to the audience, with all the authority, which followed
their power, their valour, their military exploits, united
to their appearing zeal and fervor. The private &s;oldiers,
&s;eized with the &s;ame &s;pirit, employed their vacant hours
in prayer, in peru&s;ing the Holy Scriptures, in gho&s;tly
conferences; where they compared the progre&s;s of their
&s;ouls in grace, and mutually &s;timulated each other to
farther advances in the great work of their &s;alvation.
When marching to battle, the whole field re&s;ounded, as
well with p&s;alms and &s;piritual &s;ongs adapted to the occa|&s;ion,
as with the in&s;truments of military mu&s;ic<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Dugdale, p. 7. Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 281.</NOTE>; and
each man endeavoured to drown the &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent dan|ger,
in the pro&s;pect of that crown of glory which was &s;et
before him. In &s;o holy a cau&s;e, wounds were e&s;teemed
meritorious; death, martyrdom; and the hurry and
dangers of action, in&s;tead of bani&s;hing their pious vi&s;ions,
&s;erved rather to impre&s;s their minds more &s;trongly with
them.</P>
<P>THE royali&s;ts endeavoured to throw a ridicule on this
fanatici&s;m of the parliamentary armies, without being
&s;en&s;ible how much rea&s;on they had to apprehend its dan|gerous
con&s;equences. The forces, a&s;&s;embled by the King
at Oxford, in the we&s;t, and in other places, were equal,
<PB N="54" REF="82">
if not &s;uperior, in number, to their adver&s;aries; but ac|tuated
by a very different &s;pirit. That licence, which
had been introduced by the want of pay, had ri&s;en to a
prodigious height among them, and rendered them more
formidable to their friends than to their enemies. Prince
Rupert, negligent of the people, fond of the &s;oldiery,
had indulged the troops in very unwarrantable liberties:
Wilmot, a man of profligate manners, had promoted the
&s;ame &s;pirit of di&s;order: And the licentious Goring, Ger|rard,
Sir Richard Granville, now carried it to the great|e&s;t
pitch of enormity. In the we&s;t e&s;pecially, where
Goring commanded, univer&s;al &s;poil and havoc were com|mitted;
and the whole country was laid wa&s;te by the
unbounded rapine of the army. All di&s;tinction of par|ties
being in a manner dropped; the mo&s;t devoted friends
of the church and monarchy wi&s;hed there for &s;uch &s;uc|ce&s;s
to the parliamentary forces, as might put an end to
the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions. The country people, de&s;poiled of
their &s;ub&s;tance, flocked together in &s;everal places armed
with clubs and &s;taves; and though they profe&s;&s;ed an en|mity
to the &s;oldiers of both parties, their hatred was in
mo&s;t places levelled chiefly again&s;t the royali&s;ts, from
whom they had met with the wor&s;t treatment. Many
thou&s;ands of the&s;e tumultuous pea&s;ants were a&s;&s;embled in
different parts of England; who de&s;troyed all &s;uch
&s;traggling &s;oldiers as they met with, and much infe&s;ted
the armies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. vii. p. 52, 61. 61. Whitlocke, p. 130, 131, 133, 135. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE di&s;po&s;ition of the forces on both &s;ides, was as

Pomfret, and other towns in York&s;hire: Part of it be|&s;ieged

to great difficulties. The King, being joined by
the Princes, Rupert and Maurice, lay at Oxford, with
a con&s;iderable army, about 15000 men. Fairfax and
Cromwel were po&s;ted at Wind&s;or, with the new model|led
army, about 22,000 men. Taunton, in the county
of Somer&s;et, defended by Blake, &s;uffered a long &s;iege
from Sir Richard Granville, who commanded an army
of about 8000 men; and though the defence had been
very ob&s;tinate, the garri&s;on was now reduced to the la&s;t
extremity. Goring commanded, in the we&s;t, an army
of nearly the &s;ame number<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 18, 19, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON opening the campaign, the King formed the pro|ject
of relieving Che&s;ter; Fairfax, that of relieving
Taunton. The King was fir&s;t in motion. When he
advanced to Draiton in Shrop&s;hire, Biron met him,
and brought intelligence, that his approach had rai&s;ed
the &s;iege, and that the parliamentary army was drawn
off. Fairfax, having reached Sali&s;bury in his road we&s;t|ward,
received orders from the committee of both king|doms
appointed for the management of the war, to re|turn
and lay &s;iege to Oxford, now expo&s;ed by the King's
ab&s;ence. He obeyed, after &s;ending Colonel Weldon to
the we&s;t, with a detachment of 4000 men. On Wel|don's
approach, Granville, who imagined that Fairfax
with his whole army was upon him, rai&s;ed the &s;iege,
and allowed this pertinacious town, now half taken and
half burned, to receive relief: But the royali&s;ts, being
reinforced with 3000 hor&s;e under Goring, again advan|ced
to Taunton, and &s;hut up Weldon, with his &s;mall
army, in that ruinous place<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King having affected his purpo&s;e with regard to
Che&s;ter, returned &s;outhwards; and, in his way, &s;at
down before Leice&s;ter, a garri&s;on of the parliament.
Having made a breach in the wall, he &s;tormed the town
<PB N="56" REF="84">
on all &s;ides; and, after a furious a&s;&s;ault, the &s;oldiers
entered &s;word in hand, committed all tho&s;e di&s;or|ders,
to which their natural violence, e&s;pecially when
enflamed by re&s;i&s;tance, is &s;o much addicted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 652.</NOTE>. A great
booty was taken and di&s;tributed among them: Fifteen
hundred pri&s;oners fell into the King's hands. This &s;uc|ce&s;s,
which &s;truck a great terror into the parliamentary
party, determined Fairfax to leave Oxford, which he
was beginning to approach; and marched towards the
King, with an intention of offering him battle. The
King was advancing towards Oxford, in order to rai&s;e
the &s;iege, which he apprehended was now begun; and
both armies, ere they were aware, had advanced within
&s;ix miles of each other. A council of war was called by
the King, in order to deliberate concerning the mea&s;ures
which he &s;hould now pur&s;ue. On the one hand, it
&s;eemed more prudent to delay the combat; because Ge|rard,
who lay in Wales with 3000 men, might be en|abled,
in a little time, to join the army; and Goring,
it was hoped, would &s;oon be ma&s;ter of Taunton, and
having put the we&s;t in full &s;ecurity, would then unite
his forces to tho&s;e of the King, and give him an incon|te&s;table
&s;uperiority over the enemy. On the other hand,
Prince Rupert, who&s;e boiling ardour &s;till pu&s;hed him on
to battle, excited the impatient humour of the nobility
and gentry, of which the army was full; and urged the
many difficulties under which the royali&s;ts laboured, and
from which nothing but a victory could relieve them:
The re&s;olution was taken of giving battle to Fairfax;
and the royal army immediately advanced upon him.</P>
<P>AT Na&s;eby was fought, with forces nearly equal, this
deci&s;ive and well-di&s;puted field,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Ne&s;eby.</NOTE> between the King and
parliament. The main body of the royali&s;ts was com|manded
by the King: The right wing, by Prince Ru|pert;
<PB N="57" REF="85">
The left, by Sir Marmaduke Langdale. Fairfax,
&s;econded by Skippon, placed him&s;elf in the main body
of the oppo&s;ite army: Cromwel, in the right wing:
Ireton, Cromwel's &s;on-in-law, in left. The charge
was begun, with his u&s;ual celerity and u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s, by
Prince Rupert. Tho' Ireton made ftout re&s;i&s;tance, and
even after he was run through the thigh with a pike,
&s;till maintained the combat, till he was taken pri&s;oner;
yet was that whole wing broke, and pur&s;ued with pre|cipitate
fury by Rupert: He was even &s;o incon&s;iderate as
to lo&s;e time in &s;ummoning and attacking the artillery of
the parliament, which had been le&s;t with a good guard
of infantry. The King led on his main body, and di&s;|played,
in this action, all the conduct of a pr$$ent ge|neral,
and all the valour of a &s;tout &s;oldier<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 146.</NOTE>. Fairfax
and Skippon encountered him, and well &s;upported that
reputation, which they had acquired. Skippon, being
dangerou&s;ly wounded, was de&s;ired by Fairfax to leave
the field; but declared that he would remain there as
long as one man maintained his ground<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 43. Whitlocke, p. 145.</NOTE>. The infantry
of the parliament was broke, and pre&s;&s;ed upon by the
King; tll Fairfax, with great pre&s;ence of mind, brought
up the re&s;erve and renewed the combat. Mean while,
Cromwel, having led on his troops to the attack of Lang|dale,
overbore the force of the royali&s;ts, and by his pru|dence
improved that advantage, which he had gained by
his valour. Having pur&s;ued the enemy about a quarter
of a mile, and detached &s;ome troops to prevent their ral|lying;
he turned back upon the King's infantry, and
threw them into the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion. One regiment
alone pre&s;erved its order unbroken, tho' twice de&s;perate|ly
a&s;&s;ailed by Fairfax: And that general, excited by &s;o
&s;teddy a re&s;i&s;tance, ordered Doyley, the captain of his
life-guard, to give them a third charge in front, while
he him&s;elf attacked them in rear. The regiment was
<PB N="58" REF="86">
broke. Fairfax, with his own hands, killed an en&s;ign,
and, having &s;eized the colours, gave them to a &s;oldier
to keep for him. The &s;oldier afterwards boa&s;ting that
he had won this &s;poil, was reproved by Doyley, who had
&s;een the action; <HI>Let him retain that honour,</HI> &s;aid Fairfax,
<HI>I have to-day acquired enough be&s;ide</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 145.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRINCE RUPERT, &s;en&s;ible too late of his error, left
the fruitle&s;s attack on the enemy's artillery, and joined
the King, who&s;e infantry was now totally di&s;comfited.
Charles exhorted this body of cavalry not to de&s;pair,
and cried aloud to them, <HI>One charge more, and we re|cover
the day</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 44.</NOTE>. But the di&s;advantages, under which they
laboured, were too evident; and they could by no means
be induced to renew the combat. Charles was obliged
to quit the field, and leave the victory to the enemy<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Clarendon&punc; vol. iv. p. 656, 657. Walker, p. 130, 131.</NOTE>.
The &s;lain, on the &s;ide of the parliament, exceeded tho&s;e
on the &s;ide of the King: They lo&s;t a thou&s;and men;
he not above eight hundred. But Fairfax made 500 of|ficers
pri&s;oners and 4000 private men: Took all the
King's artillery and ammunition, and totally di&s;&s;ipated
his infantry: So that &s;carce any victory could be more
compleat, than that which he obtained.</P>
<P>AMONG the other &s;poils, was &s;eized the King's cabi|net,
with the copies of his letters to the Queen, which
the parliament afterwards ordered to be publi&s;hed<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv p. 658.</NOTE>.
They cho&s;e, no doubt, &s;uch of them as they thought
would reflect mo&s;t di&s;honour upon him: Yet upon the
whole, the letters are wrote with delicacy and tender|ne&s;s,
and give an advantageous idea both of the King's
genius and morals. A mighty fondne&s;s, 'tis true, and
attachment, he expre&s;&s;es to his con&s;ort, and often pro|fe&s;&s;es

immediately to the we&s;t, with a view of &s;aving Taun|ton,
and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the only con&s;iderable force which
now remained to the royali&s;ts.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the campaign, Charles, appre|hen&s;ive
of the event, had &s;ent the Prince of Wales, now
fifteen years of age, to the we&s;t, with the title of gene|ral,
and had given orders, if he was pre&s;&s;ed by the ene|my,
that he &s;hould make his e&s;cape into a foreign coun|try,
and &s;ave one part of the royal family from the vio|lence
of the parliament. Prince Rupert had thrown
him&s;elf into Bri&s;tol, with an intention of defending that
important city. Goring commanded the army before
Taunton.</P>
<P>ON Fairfax's approach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July.</NOTE> the &s;iege of Taunton was
rai&s;ed; and the royali&s;ts retired to Lamport, an open
town in the county of Somer&s;et. Fairfax attacked them
in that po&s;t, beat them from it, killed about 300 men,

was, to the la&s;t degree, di&s;a&s;trous and melancholy.
As the dread of ills is commonly more oppre&s;&s;ive than
their real pre&s;ence, perhaps in no period of his life was
he more ju&s;tly the object of compa&s;&s;ion. His vigor of
mind, which, tho' it &s;ometimes failed him in acting,
never de&s;erted him in his &s;ufferings, was what alone &s;up|ported
him; and he was determined, as he wrote to
Lord Digby, if he could not live as a king to die like
a gentleman; nor &s;hould any of his friends, he &s;aid,
ever have rea&s;on to blu&s;h for the prince, whom they had

his more generous friends, who re&s;pected his misfortunes

which he made for a peaceful and equitable accom|modation

blood &s;pilt during the war, they told him, that they were
preparing bills for him, and his pa&s;&s;ing them would be
the be&s;t pledge of his inclination towards peace: In
other words, he mu&s;t yield at di&s;cretion<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 217, 219. Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 744.</NOTE>. He de&s;ired a

the mo&s;t grievous part of his mi&s;fortunes.</P>
<P>AFTER the ce&s;&s;ation with the Iri&s;h rebels, the King
was de&s;irous of concluding a final peace with them, and
obtaining their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in England: And he gave au|thority
to Ormond, Lord lieutenant, to promi&s;e them
an abrogation of all the penal laws, enacted again&s;t ca|tholics;
together with the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of Poining's &s;ta|tute,
with regard to &s;ome particular bills, which &s;hould
be agred on. Lord Herbert, created Earl of Glamorgan,
(tho' his patent had not yet pa&s;&s;ed the &s;eals) having occa|&s;ion,
<PB N="67" REF="101">
for his private affairs to go to Ireland, the King
con&s;idered that this Nobleman, being a catholic and
allied to the be&s;t Iri&s;h families, might be of &s;ervice: He
al&s;o fore&s;aw, that farther conce&s;&s;ions with regard to reli|gion
might probably be demanded by the bigoted Iri&s;h;
and that as the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, however nece&s;&s;ary, would
give great &s;candal to the prote&s;tant zealots in his three
kingdoms, it would be requi&s;ite both to conceal them
during &s;ome time, and to pre&s;erve Ormond's character
by giving privately authority to Glamorgan to conclude
and &s;ign the&s;e articles. But as he had a better opinion
of Glamorgan's zeal and affection for his &s;ervice, than of
his capacity, he injoined him to communicate all his
mea&s;ures to Ormond; and tho' the final conclu&s;ion of
the treaty mu&s;t be performed only in Glamorgan's own
name, he was required to be directed, in the &s;teps to|wards
it, by the opinion of the Lord lieutenant. Gla|morgan,
bigoted to his religion, and pa&s;&s;ionate for the
King's &s;ervice, but guided in the&s;e pur&s;uits by no manner
of judgment or di&s;cretion, &s;ecretly, of him&s;elf, without
any communication with Ormond, concluded a peace with
the council of Kilkenny, and agreed in the King's name,
that the Iri&s;h &s;hould enjoy all the churches, which they
had ever been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, &s;ince the commencement
of their in&s;urrection; on condition that they &s;hould a&s;|&s;i&s;t
the King in England with a body of ten thou&s;and
men. This tran&s;action was di&s;covered by accident. The
titular archbi&s;hop of Tuam being killed by a &s;ally of the
garri&s;on of Sligo, the articles of the treaty were found
among his baggage, and were immediately publi&s;hed
every where, and copies of them &s;ent over to the Eng|li&s;h
parliament<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi$. p. 239.</NOTE>. The Lord lieutenant and Lord Digby,
fore&s;eeing the clamour which would be rai&s;ed again&s;t the
King, committed Glamorgan to pri&s;on, charged him with
high trea&s;on for his temerity, and maintained that he
<PB N="68" REF="102">
had acted altogether without any authority from his Ma|je&s;ty.
The Engli&s;h parliament likewi&s;e neglected not &s;o
favourable an opportunity of reviving the old clamour
with regard to the King's favour of popery, and accu&s;ed
him of delivering over, in a manner, the whole kingdom
of Ireland to that hated &s;ect. The King told them,
&startq;That the Earl of Glamorgan having made an offer
unto him to rai&s;e forces in the kingdom of Ireland,
and to conduct them into England for his Maje&s;ty's
&s;ervice, had a commi&s;&s;ion to that purpo&s;e, and to that
purpo&s;e only, and that he had no commi&s;&s;ion at all to
treat of any thing el&s;e, without the privity and di|rection
of the Lord lieutenant, much le&s;s to capitu|late
any thing concerning religion, or any property

are de&s;irous of repre&s;enting this very innocent tran|faction,
in which the King was engaged by the mo&s;t vio|lent
nece&s;&s;ity, as a &s;tain on the memory of that unfor|tunate
prince<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><P>Dr. Birch has wrote a treati&s;e on this &s;ubject, with all that care and ac|curacy, by which he has been enabled to throw light on many pa&s;&s;ages of the Engli&s;h hi&s;tory. It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to oppo&s;e any facts contained in that gentleman's performance. I &s;hall only produce arguments, which prove that Glamorgan, when he received his private commi&s;&s;ion, had injunctions from the King to act altogether in concert with Ormond. 1. It &s;eems to be imply'd in the very words of the Commi&s;&s;ion. Glamorgan is empowered and authori&s;ed to treat and conclude with the confederate Roman catholics in Ireland. &startq;If upon nece&s;&s;ity any (<HI>articles</HI>) be conde&s;cende$ unto, wherein the King's lieutenant cannot &s;o well be &s;een in, as not fit for us at pre&s;ent publickly to own.&endq; Here no articles are mentioned, which are not fit to be communicated to Ormond, but only not fit for him and the King publickly to be &s;een in, and to ayow. 2. The King's prote&s;tation to Ormond, ought, both on account of that prince's character, and the rea&s;ons he a&s;&s;igns, to have the greate&s;t weight. The words are the&s;e, &startq;Ormond, I cannot but add to my long letter, that, upon the word of a chri&s;tian, I never intend|ed Glamorgan &s;hould treat any thing without your approbation, much le&s;s without your knowledge. For be&s;ides the injury to you, I was always dif|fident of his judgment (though I could not think him &s;o extremely weak as now to my co&s;t I have found;) which you may ea&s;ily perceive in a po&s;t|&s;cript of a letter of mine to you.&endq; Carte, vol. ii. App. xxiii. It is im|po&s;&s;ible, that any man of honour, however he might di&s;&s;emble with his ene|mies, would a&s;&s;ert a fal&s;ehood in &s;o &s;olemn a manner to his be&s;t friend; e&s;pecially where that per&s;on mu&s;t have had opportunities of knowing the truth. The letter, who&s;e po&s;t&s;cript is mentioned by the King, is to be found in Carte, vol. ii. App. xiii. 3. Mr. Carte has publi&s;hed a whole &s;eries of the King's corre&s;pondence with Ormond, from the time that Glamorgan came into Ire|land; and it is evident that Charles all along con&s;iders the lord lieutenantas the only per&s;on who was conducting the negotiations with the Iri&s;h. The 31&s;t of July 1645, after the battle of Na&s;eby, being reduced to great &s;traits, he writes earne&s;tly to Ormond to conclude a peace upon certain conditions mentioned, much inferior to tho&s;e granted by Glamorgan; and to come over him&s;elf with all the Iri&s;h he could engage in his &s;ervice. Carte, vol. iii. No. 400. This would have been a great ab&s;urdity, if he had already fixed a different canal, by which, on very different conditions, he propo&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h a peace. On the 22d of October, as his di&s;tre&s;&s;es multiply, he &s;omewhat enlarges the con|ditions, though they &s;till fall &s;hort of Glamorgan's: A new ab&s;urdity! See Carte, vol. iii. p. 411. 4. But what is equivalent to a demon&s;tration, that Glamorgan was con&s;cious that he had no powers to conclude a treaty on the&s;e terms, or without con&s;ulting the $ord lieutenant, and did not even expect, that the King would ratify the articles, is the defeazance, which he gave to the Iri&s;h council at the time of $igning the treaty. &startq;The Earl of Glamor|gan does no way intend hereby to oblige his Maje&s;ty other than he him&s;elf &s;hall plea&s;e, after he has received the&s;e 10,000 men, as a pledge and te&s;ti|mony of the &s;aid Roman catholics' loyalty and fidelity to his Maje&s;ty; yet he promi&s;es faithfully, upon his word and honour, not to acquaint his Ma|je&s;ty with this defeazance, till he had endeavoured, as far as in him lay, to induce his Maje&s;ty to the granting of the particulars in the &s;aid articles: But that done, the &s;aid commi&s;&s;ioners di&s;charge the &s;aid Earl of Glamorgan, both in honour and con&s;cience, of any farther engagement to them there|in; though his Maje&s;ty &s;hould not be plea&s;ed to grant the &s;aid particulars in the articles mentioned; the &s;aid Earl having given them a&s;&s;urance, upon his word, honour, and voluntary oath, that he would never, to any per&s;on what&s;oever, di&s;cover this defeazance in the interim without their con&s;ents.&endq; Dr. Bi$ch, p. 96. All Glamorgan's view was to get troops for the King's &s;ervice, without hurting his own honour or his ma&s;ter's. The wonder only is, why the Iri&s;h accepted a treaty, which bound no body, and which the very per&s;on, who concludes it, &s;eems to confe&s;s he does not expect to be ra|tified. They probably hoped, that the King would from their &s;ervices, be more ea&s;ily induced to ratify a treaty which was concluded, than to con&s;ent to its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>This note is &s;omewhat different from that publi&s;hed in the fir&s;t edition. On a review, I do not find that the King ever po&s;itively affirmed that Glamor|gan's powers were forgeries. He &s;ays not &s;o in his declaration to the parlia|ment above-cited. In his letter to Ormond and the Iri&s;h council, he &s;eems even to acknowledge their reality; at lea&s;t &s;ays that he might po&s;&s;ibly have given him &s;ome powers to treat; though he always enjoined him to act in &s;ubordination to the lord lieutenant. Carte, vol. iii. p. 425.</P>
<P>Dr. Birch, in page 360, has publi&s;hed a letter of the King's to Glamorgan, where he &s;ays, &startq;Howbeit I know you cannot be but confident of my mak+ing good all in&s;tructions and promi&s;es to you and the nuncio.&endq; But it is to be remarked, that this letter is dated in April 5, 1646; after there had been a new negotiation entered into between Glamorgan and the Iri&s;h, and after a provi&s;ional treaty had even been concluded between them. See Dr. Birch, p. 179. The King's a&s;&s;urances, therefore, can plainly relate only to this recent tran&s;action. The old treaty had long been di&s;a$owed by the King and &s;uppo&s;ed by all parties to be annulled.</P></NOTE></P>

as well as civil di&s;putes agitated the whole nation.</P>
<P>THE parliament, though they had very early aboli&s;hed
epi&s;copal authority, had not, during &s;o long a time,
&s;ub&s;tituted any other in its place; and their committees
of religion had hitherto a&s;&s;umed the whole eccle&s;ia&s;tical
juri&s;diction: But they now e&s;tabli&s;hed, by an ordinance,
the pre&s;byterian government in all its forms of <HI>congrega|tional,
cla&s;&s;ical, provincial,</HI> and <HI>national</HI> a&s;&s;emblies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs.</NOTE> All
the inhabitants of each pari&s;h were ordered to meet and
chu&s;e elders, on whom, together with the mini&s;ter, was
be&s;towed the intire direction of all &s;piritual concerns
within the congregation. A number of neighbouring
<PB N="71" REF="105">
pari&s;hes, commonly between twelve and twenty, formed
a cla&s;&s;is; and the court, which governed this divi&s;ion,
was compo&s;ed of all the mini&s;ters, together with two,
three, or four elders cho&s;en from each pari&s;h. The pro|vincial
a&s;&s;embly retained an in&s;pection over &s;everal neigh|bouring
cla&s;&s;es, and was compo&s;ed intirely of clergy|men:
The national a&s;&s;embly was con&s;tituted in the
&s;ame manner; and its authority extended over the whole
kingdom. 'Tis probable, that the tyranny exerci&s;ed by
the Scots clergy, had given warning not to allow lay|men
a place in the provincial or national a&s;&s;emblies; le&s;t
the nobility and more con&s;iderable gentry, &s;olliciting a
&s;eat in the&s;e great eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, &s;hould be&s;tow a
con&s;ideration upon them, and render them, in the eyes
of the multitude, a rival to the parliament. In the in|ferior
courts, the mixture of the laity might &s;erve rather
to temper the zeal of the clergy<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 224.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the pre&s;byterians, by the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of parity among the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, were &s;o far gratified,
they were denied &s;atisfaction in &s;everal other points, on
which they were extremely intent. The a&s;&s;embly of
divines had voted pre&s;bytery to be of divine right: The
parliament refu&s;ed their a&s;&s;ent to that deci&s;ion<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 106. Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 260, 261.</NOTE>. Selden,
Whitelock, and other political rea&s;oners, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the
independents, had prevailed in this important delibera|tion.
They thought, that had the bigoted religoni&s;ts
been able to get their heavenly charter recognized, the
pre&s;byters would &s;oon become more dangerous to the
magi&s;trate than had ever been the prelatical clergy.
The&s;e latter, while they claimed to them&s;elves a divine
right, admitted of a like origin to civil authority: The
former, challenging to their own order a cele&s;tial pedigree,
derived the legi&s;lative power from no more dignified a
&s;ource than the voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of the people.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="106">
UNDER colour of keeping the &s;acraments from profana|tion,
the clergy of all chri&s;tian &s;ects had a&s;&s;umed, what
they call the power of the keys, or the right of fulmi|nating
excommunication. The example of Scotland
was a &s;ufficient le&s;&s;on for the parliament to make
provi&s;ion again&s;t &s;o &s;evere a tyranny. They determined,
by an ordinance, all the ca&s;es in which excommunica|tion
could be u&s;ed. They allowed of appeals to the par|liament
from all eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts. And they appoint|ed
commi&s;&s;ioners in each province to judge of &s;uch ca&s;es
as fell not within their ordinance<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 210.</NOTE>. So much civil au|thority,
intermixed with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, gave di&s;gu&s;t
to all the zealots.</P>
<P>BUT nothing was attended with more univer&s;al &s;can|dal
than the propen&s;ity of many in the parliament to|wards
a toleration of the prote&s;tant &s;ectaries. The pre&s;|byterians
exclaimed, that this indulgence made the
church of Chri&s;t re&s;emble Noah's ark, and rendered it a
receptacle for all unclean bea&s;ts. They in&s;i&s;ted, that
the lea&s;t of Chri&s;t's truths was &s;uperior to all political
con&s;iderations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 308.</NOTE>. They maintained the eternal obligation
of their covenant to extirpate here&s;y and &s;chi&s;m. And
they menaced all their opponents with the &s;ame rigid
per&s;ecution, of which they had, them&s;elves, &s;o loudly
complained, when held in &s;ubjection by the hierarchy.</P>
<P>So great prudence and re&s;erve, in &s;uch material points,
does great honour to the parliament; and proves, that
notwith&s;tanding the prevalence of bigotry and fanati|ci&s;m,
there were many members, who had more enlarg|ed
views, and paid regard to the civil intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.
The&s;e men, uniting them&s;elves to the enthu&s;ia&s;ts, who&s;e
genius, is naturally aver&s;e to clerical u&s;urpations, exer|ci&s;ed
&s;o jealous an authority over the a&s;&s;embly of divines,
that they allowed them nothing but the liberty of ten|dering
<PB N="73" REF="107">
advice, and would not entru&s;t them even with
the power of electing their own chairman or his &s;ub&s;ti|tute,
or of &s;upplying the vacancies of their own mem|bers.</P>
<P>WHILE the di&s;putes were canva&s;&s;ed by theologians,
who engaged in their &s;piritual conte&s;ts every order of
the &s;tate; the King, though he entertained hopes of
reaping advantage from the&s;e divi&s;ions, was much at a
lo&s;s what &s;ide it would be mo&s;t for his intere&s;t to comply
with. The pre&s;byterians were, by their principles, the
lea&s;t aver&s;e to regal authority; but were rigidly bent on
the extirpation of prelacy: The independents were re&s;o|lute
to lay the foundations of a republican government;
but as they pretended not to erect them&s;elves into a na|tional
church, it might be hoped, that, if gratified with
a toleration, they would admit the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of
the hierarchy. So great attachment had the King to
epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, that he was ever inclined to put it
in ballance even with his own power and kingly office.</P>
<P>BUT whatever advantage he might propo&s;e to reap
from the divi&s;ions of the parliamentary party, he was
apprehen&s;ive, that it would come too late, to &s;ave him
from that de&s;truction with which he was in&s;tantly
threatened. Fairfax was approaching with a powerful
and victorious army, and was taking the proper mea|&s;ures
for laying &s;iege to Oxford, which mu&s;t infallibly
fall into his hands. To be taken captive, and led in
triumph by his in&s;olent enemies, was what Charles ju&s;tly
abhorred; and every in&s;ult, if not violence, was to be
dreaded, from that enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;oldiery, who hated his
per&s;on, and de&s;pi&s;ed his dignity. In this de&s;perate ex|tremity,
he embraced a mea&s;ure, which, in any other
&s;ituation, might ju&s;tly lie under the imputation of im|prudence
and indi&s;cretion.</P>

MONTREVILLE, the French mini&s;ter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1649.</NOTE> intere&s;ted for
the King more by the natural &s;entiments of humanity,
than any in&s;tructions from his court, which &s;eemed ra|ther
to favour the parliament, had &s;ollicited the Scots ge|nerals
and commi&s;&s;ioners, to give protection to their di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
&s;overeign; and having received many general pro|fe&s;&s;ions
and promi&s;es, he had always tran&s;mitted the&s;e,
perhaps with &s;ome exaggeration, to the King. From
his &s;ugge&s;tions, Charles began to entertain thoughts of
leaving Oxford, and flying to the Scots army, which at
that time lay before Newark<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. iv. p. 750. vol. v. p. 16.</NOTE>. He con&s;idered that the
Scots nation had been fully gratified in all their de|mands;
and having already, in their own country, an|nihilated
both epi&s;copacy and regal authority, had no
farther conce&s;&s;ions to exact of him. In all di&s;putes,
which had pa&s;&s;ed about &s;ettling the terms of peace, the
Scots, he heard, had &s;till adhered to the milder &s;ide, and
had endeavoured to &s;often the rigour of the Engli&s;h par|liament.
Great di&s;gu&s;ts al&s;o, on other accounts, had
taken place between the nations; and the Scots found,
that, in proportion as their a&s;&s;i&s;tance became le&s;s nece&s;|&s;ary,
le&s;s value was put upon them. The progre&s;s of
the independents gave them great alarm; and they were
&s;candalized to hear their beloved covenant &s;poken of
every day, with le&s;s regard and reverence. The refu&s;al
of a divine right to pre&s;bytery, and the infringing eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
di&s;cipline from political con&s;iderations, were, to
them, the &s;ubject of much offence; and the King hoped,
that, in their pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;ight of their na|tive
prince, flying to them in this extremity of di&s;tre&s;s,
would rouze every &s;park of genero&s;ity in their bo&s;om,
and procure him their favour and protection.</P>
<P>THAT he might the better conceal his intention, orders
were given at every gate in Oxford, for allowing three per|&s;ons
to pa&s;s; and in the night, the King, accompanied
<PB N="75" REF="111">
only with Dr. Hud&s;on and Mr. A&s;hburnham, went out at
that gate, which leads to London. He rode before a
portmanteau, and called him&s;elf A&s;hburnham's &s;ervant.
He pa&s;&s;ed through St. Albans, Henley, and came &s;o near
London as Harrow on the Hill. He once entertained
&s;ome thoughts of entering into this city, and of throw|ing
him&s;elf on the mercy of the parliament. But at la&s;t,
after pa&s;&s;ing through many cro&s;s roads, he arrived at the
Scots camp before Newark<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 267.</NOTE>. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of May.</NOTE> hearing
of his e&s;cape from Oxford, i&s;&s;ued rigorous orders, and
threatened with in&s;tant death, whoever &s;hould harbour
or conceal him<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 209.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Scots generals and commi&s;&s;ioners affected great<NOTE PLACE="marg">King goes to the Scots camp at Newark.</NOTE>
&s;urprize at the appearance of the King: And though
they payed him all the exterior re&s;pect due to his dig|nity,
they in&s;tantly put a guard upon him, under colour
of protection; and made him in reality a pri&s;oner.
They informed the Engli&s;h parliament of this unexpect|ed
incident, and a&s;&s;ured them, that they had entered in|to
no private treaty with the King. They applied to
him for orders to Bella&s;is, governor of Newark, to &s;ur|render
that town, now reduced to extremity; and the
orders were in&s;tantly obeyed. And hearing that the par|liament
laid claim to the entire di&s;po&s;al of the King's
per&s;on, and that the Engli&s;h army were making &s;ome
motions towards them; they thought proper to retire
northwards, and fixed their camp at Newca&s;tle<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 271. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure was very agreeable to the King; and he be|gan
to entertain hopes of protection from the Scots. He was
particularly attentive to the behaviour of their preachers,
on whom all depended. It was the mode of that age
to make the pulpit the &s;cene of news; and on every
great event, the whole Scripture was ran&s;acked by the
clergy, for pa&s;&s;ages applicable to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.

The fir&s;t mini&s;ter who preached before the King, cho&s;e
the&s;e words for his text. &startq;And behold all the men of I&s;rael

brethren the men of Judah, &s;tolen thee away, and
have brought the king and his hou&s;hold, and all Da|vid's
men with him, over Jordan? And all the men
of Judah an&s;wered the men of I&s;rael, Becau&s;e the
king is near of kin to us; wherefore then be ye angry
for this matter? Have we eaten at all of the King's
co&s;t? or hath he given us any gift? And the men of
I&s;rael an&s;wered the men of Judah, and &s;aid, we have
ten parts in the king, and we have al&s;o more right in
David than ye: Why then did ye de&s;pi&s;e us, that our
advice &s;hould not be fir&s;t had in bringing back our
king? And the words of the men of Judah were
fiercer than the words of the men of I&s;rael<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. chap. xix. 41, 42, and 43 ver&s;es. See Clarendon, vol. $word$ p. 23, 24.</NOTE>.&endq; But
the King &s;oon found, that the happine&s;s of the allu&s;ion
chiefly had tempted the preacher to employ this text,
and that the covenanting zealots were no wi&s;e pacified
towards him. Another preacher, after reproaching him
to his face, with his mi&s;government, ordered this p&s;alm
to be &s;ung;
<Q><L>Why do&s;t thou, tyrant, boa&s;t thy&s;elf</L>
<L>Thy wicked deeds to prai&s;e:</L></Q>
The King &s;tood up, and called for that p&s;alm which be|gins
with the&s;e words,
<Q><L>Have mercy, Lord, on me, I pray;</L>

<P>CHARLES had very little rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with his
&s;ituation. Not only he found him&s;elf a pri&s;oner, very
narrowly guarded: All his friends were kept at a di&s;|tance;
and no intercour&s;e, either by letters or conver|&s;ation,
was allowed him with any one, on whom he
could depend, or who was &s;u&s;pected of any attachment
to him. The Scots generals would enter into no confi|dence
with him; and &s;till treated him with di&s;tant cere|mony
and feigned re&s;pect. And every propo&s;al, which
they made him, tended farther to his aba&s;ement and his
ruin<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 30.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY required him to i&s;&s;ue orders to Oxford, and all
his other garri&s;ons, commanding their &s;urrender to the
parliament: And the King, &s;en&s;ible that their re&s;i&s;tance
was to very little purpo&s;e, willingly complied. The
terms which were given to mo&s;t of them, were honour|able;
and Fairfax, as far as $ay in his power, was very
exact in ob&s;erving them. Far from allowing violence;
he would not even permit in&s;ults or triumph over the un|fortunate
royali&s;ts; and by his generous humanity, &s;o
cruel a civil war ended, in appearance, very calmly, be|tween
the parties.</P>
<P>ORMOND having received like orders, delivered Dub|lin,
and other forts, into the hands of the parliamentary
officers. Montro&s;e al&s;o, after having experienced &s;till
more variety of good and bad fortune, threw down his
arms, and retired out of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE Marque&s;s of Worce&s;ter, a man pa&s;t eighty-four,
was the la&s;t in England who &s;ubmitted to the authority
of the parliament. He defended Raglan ca&s;tle to extre|mity;
and opened not its gates till the middle of Augu&s;t.
Four years, a few days excepted, were now elap&s;ed, &s;ince
<PB N="78" REF="116">
the King, fir&s;t erected his &s;tandard at Nottingham<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 293.</NOTE>. So
long had the Briti&s;h nations, by civil and religious quar|rels,
been occupied in &s;hedding their own blood, and
laying wa&s;te their mother-country.</P>
<P>THE parliament and the Scots laid their propo&s;als be|fore
the King. They were &s;uch as a captive, entirely
at mercy, could expect from the mo&s;t inexorable victor:
Yet were they little wor&s;e than what were in&s;i&s;ted on
before the battle of Na&s;eby. The power of the &s;word,
in&s;tead of ten, which the King now offered, was de|manded
for twenty years, together with a right to levy
whatever money the parliament &s;hould think proper for
the &s;upport of their armies. The other conditions were,
in the main, the &s;ame with tho&s;e which were formerly
offered to the King<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 309.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CHARLES &s;aid, that propo&s;als, which introduced &s;uch
important innovations in the con&s;titution, demanded
time for deliberation: The commi&s;&s;ioners replied, that
he mu&s;t give his an&s;wer in ten days<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol vii. p. 319.</NOTE>. He de&s;ired to
rea&s;on about the meaning and import of the terms:
They informed him, that they had no power of debate;
and required peremptorily his con&s;ent or refu&s;al. He re|que&s;ted
a per&s;onal treaty with the parliament: They
threatened, that, if he delayed compliance, the parlia|ment
would, by their own authority, &s;ettle the nation.</P>
<P>WHAT the parliament was mo&s;t intent upon, was not
the treaty with the King, to whom they paid little re|gard;
but that with the Scots nation. Two important
points remained to be &s;ettled with them; their delivery
of the King, and the e&s;timation of their arrears.</P>
<P>THE Scots pretended, that, as Charles was King of
Scotland as well as of England, they were intitled to an
equal vote in the di&s;po&s;al of his per&s;on: And that, in
&s;uch a ca&s;e, where the titles are equal, and the &s;ubject
<PB N="79" REF="117">
indivi&s;ible, the preference was due to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;or.
The Engli&s;h maintained, that, the King, being
in England, was comprehended within the juri&s;diction
of that kingdom, and could not be di&s;po&s;ed of by any
foreign nation. A delicate que&s;tion this, and what &s;urely
could not be decided by precedent; &s;ince &s;uch a &s;itua|tion
is not, any where, to be found in hi&s;tory<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the Scots concurred with the Engli&s;h, in impo&s;ing
&s;uch rigorous conditions on the King, that, notwith|&s;tanding
his unfortunate &s;ituation, he &s;till refu&s;ed to ac|cept
of them; it is certain, that they did not de&s;ire his
freedom: nor could they ever intend to join lenity and
tyranny together, in &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent a manner. Before
the &s;ettlement of terms, the admini&s;tration mu&s;t be po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
intirely by the parliaments of both kingdoms; and
how incompatible that &s;cheme with the liberty of the
King, is ea&s;ily imagined. To carry him a pri&s;oner into
Scotland, where few forces could be &s;upported in order
to guard him, was a mea&s;ure &s;o full of inconvenience
and danger, that, even if the Engli&s;h had con&s;ented to
it, it mu&s;t have appeared to the Scots nation altogether
ineligible: And how could &s;uch a plan be &s;upported in
oppo&s;ition to England, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch numerous, and
victorious armies, which were, at that time, or at lea&s;t,
&s;eemed to be, in intire union with the parliament? The
only expedient, it is obvious, which the Scots could
embrace, if they &s;crupled intirely to abandon the King,
was immediately to return, fully and cordially, to their
allegiance; and, uniting them&s;elves with the royali&s;ts
of both kingdoms, endeavour, by force of arms, to re|duce
the Engli&s;h parliament to more moderate condi|tions:
But be&s;ides that this mea&s;ure was full of extreme
hazard; what was it but in&s;tantly to combine with
their old enemies again&s;t their old friends, and in a fit of
romantic genero&s;ity, overturn what, with &s;o much ex|pence
<PB N="80" REF="118">
of blood and trea&s;ure, they had, during the cour&s;e
of &s;o many years, been &s;o carefully erecting?</P>
<P>BUT, though all the&s;e reflections occurred to the Scots
commi&s;&s;ioners, they re&s;olved to prolong the di&s;pute, and
to keep the King as a pledge for tho&s;e arrears, which
they claimed from England, and which they were not
likely, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of that nation, to ob|tain
by any other expedient. The &s;um, by their ac|count,
amounted to two millions: For they had receiv|ed
very little regular pay, &s;ince they had entered Eng|land.
And though the contributions which they had
levied, as well as the price of their living on free quar|ters,
mu&s;t be deducted; yet &s;till the &s;um, which they
in&s;i&s;ted on, was very con&s;iderable. After many di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions,
it was, at la&s;t, agreed, that, in lieu of all de|mands,
they &s;hould accept of 400,000 pounds, one half
to be paid in&s;tantly, another within a twelve-month<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 326.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>GREAT pains were taken by the Scots (and the Eng|li&s;h
complied with their pretended delicacy) to make this
e&s;timation and payment of arrears appear a quite diffe|rent
tran&s;action from that for the delivery of the King's
per&s;on: But common &s;en&s;e requires, that they &s;hould
be regarded as one and the &s;ame. The Engli&s;h, it is
evident, had they not been previou&s;ly a&s;&s;ured of receiv|ing
the King, would never have parted with &s;o con&s;i|derable
a &s;um, and, while they weakened them&s;elves, by
the &s;ame mea&s;ure have &s;trengthened a people, with
whom they &s;hould afterwards have &s;o material an intere&s;t
to di&s;cu&s;s.</P>
<P>THUS the Scots nation underwent, and &s;till undergo
(for &s;uch grievous &s;tains are not ea&s;ily wiped off) the re|proach
of &s;elling their King, and bargaining their prince
for money. In vain, did they maintain, That this
money was, on account of former &s;ervices, un|doubtedly
<PB N="81" REF="119">
their due; that in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation, no
other mea&s;ure, without the utmo&s;t indi&s;cretion, or even
their apparent ruin, could be embraced; that though
they delivered their King into the hands of his open
enemies, they were them&s;elves as much his open ene|mies
as tho&s;e to whom they &s;urrendered him, and their
common hatred again&s;t him had long united the two par|ties
in &s;trict alliance with each other. They were &s;till
an&s;wered, that they made u&s;e of this &s;candalous expe|dient
to obtain their wages; and that, after taking
arms, without any provocation, again&s;t their &s;overeign,
who had ever loved and cheri&s;hed them, they had de|&s;ervedly
fallen into a &s;ituation, from which they could

<P>THE infamy of this bargain had &s;uch influence on the
Scots parliament, that they once voted, that the King
&s;hould be protected and his liberty in&s;i&s;ted on. But the
general a&s;&s;embly interpo&s;ed, and pronounced, that, as
he had refu&s;ed to take the covenant, which was pre&s;&s;ed
on him, it became not the godly to concern them&s;elves
about his fortunes. After this declaration, it behoved
the parliament to retract their vote.</P>
<P>INTELLIGENCE of the final re&s;olution of the Scots

continued his game without interruption; and none of

peru&s;ed, had brought him news of any con&s;equence.
The Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who, &s;ome days after, came

moved partly by curio&s;ity, partly by compa&s;&s;ion and af|fection.
If any &s;till retained rancour again&s;t him, in his
pre&s;ent condition, they pa&s;&s;ed in &s;ilence; while his well-wi&s;hers,
more generous than prudent, accompanied his

the general tenderne&s;s, which began to prevail for this
virtuous and unhappy monarch.</P>
<P>THE commi&s;&s;ioners rendered his confinement at
Holmby very rigorous; di&s;mi&s;&s;ing all his antient &s;er|vants,
debarring him from all vi&s;its, and cutting off all
communication with his friends or family. The parlia|ment,
though earne&s;tly applied to by the King, refu&s;ed
to allow his chaplains to attend him; becau&s;e they had
not taken the covenant. The King refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at

<P>THE dominion of the parliament was of very
&s;hort duration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LIX.</NOTE> No &s;ooner had they &s;ubdued
their &s;overeign, than their own $span$ up again&s;t
$word$, and tumbled them $span$ throne.
The $acred boundaries of the $span$ viol$red,
nothing remained to confine the wild projects of zeal and
ambition. And every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive revolution became a
precedent for that which followed it.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the terror of the King's power dimi|ni&s;hed,
the divi&s;ions between independent and pre&s;byte|rian
became every day more apparent; and the neuters
found it, at la&s;t, requi&s;ite to &s;eek &s;helter in one or the
other faction. Many new writs were i&s;&s;ued for elections,
in room of members, who had died, or were di&s;qualified
for adhering to the King; yet &s;till the pre&s;byterians re|tained
the &s;uperiority among the commons: And all the
peers, except Lord Say, were e&s;teemed of that party.
The independents, to whom all the inferior &s;ectaries ad|hered,
predominated in the army: And the troops of
the new model were univer&s;ally affected with that en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
&s;pirit. To their a&s;&s;i&s;tance did the independent
party, among the commons, chiefly tru&s;t, in their pro|jects
for acquiring the a&s;cendant over their antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="125">
SOON after the retreat of the Scots, the pre&s;byterians,
&s;eeing every thing reduced to obedience, began to talk of
di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable part of the army: And, on pre|tence
of ea&s;ing the public burthens, they levelled a
deadly blow at the oppo&s;ite faction. They propo&s;ed to
embark a &s;trong detachment, under Skippon and Ma&s;&s;ey,
for the &s;ervice of Ireland: They openly declared their
intention of making a great reduction of the remainder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Fourteen thou&s;and men were only propo&s;ed to be kept up; 6000 hor&s;e, 6000 foot, and 2000 dragoons. Bates.</NOTE>.
It was even imagined, that another new model of the
army was projected, in order to regain to the pre&s;byte|rians,
that &s;uperiority, which they had &s;o imprudently
lo&s;t by the former<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 564.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE army had &s;mall inclination to the &s;ervice of Ire|land;
a country barbarous, uncultivated, and laid wa&s;te
by ma&s;&s;acres, and civil commotions: They had le&s;s in|clination
to di&s;band, and to renounce that pay, which,
having earned it through fatigues and dangers, they now
propo&s;ed to enjoy in ea&s;e and tranquillity. And mo&s;t
of the $span$ rai&s;ed from th$ $$egs of $span$,
had no other pro&s;pect, if deprived of their commi&s;&s;ion,
than that of returning to langui&s;h in their native pover|ty
and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P>THESE motives of intere&s;t acquired additional in|fluence,
and became more dangerous to the parlia|ment,
from the religious &s;pirit, by which the army was
univer&s;ally animated. Among the generality of men,
educated in regular, civilized &s;ocieties, the &s;entiments of
&s;hame, duty, honour, have con&s;iderable authority, and
&s;erve to counterballance and direct the motives, derived
from private advantage: But, by the predominancy of
enthu&s;ia&s;m among the parliamentary forces, all the&s;e &s;a|lutary
principles lo&s;t their credit, and were regarded as
<PB N="86" REF="126">
mere human inventions, yea moral in&s;titutions, $itter
for heathens than for chri&s;tians<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vi. p. 134.</NOTE>. The &s;aint, re&s;igned
over to &s;uperior guidance, was at full liberty to gratify
all his appetites, di&s;gui&s;ed under the appearance of pious
zeal. And, be&s;ides the &s;trange corruptions engendered
by this &s;pirit, it eluded and loo&s;ened all the ties of mo|rality,
and gave intire &s;cope, and even &s;anction to the
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and ambition, which naturally adhere to the
human mind.</P>
<P>THE military confe&s;&s;ors were farther encouraged in
di&s;obedience to &s;uperiors, by that &s;piritual pride, to which
a mi&s;taken piety is &s;o &s;ubject. They were not, they
&s;aid, mere janizaries; mercenary troops inli&s;ted for hire,
and to be di&s;po&s;ed of at the will of their payma&s;ters<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 565.</NOTE>.
Religion and liberty were the motives, which had excit|ed
them to arms; and they had a &s;uperior right to &s;ee
tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which they had purcha&s;ed with their
blood, en&s;ured to future generations. By the &s;ame title,
that the pre&s;byterians, in contradi&s;tinction to the roy|ali&s;ts,
had appropriated to them&s;elves the epithet of the
<HI>godly,</HI> or the <HI>well-affected</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 474.</NOTE>; the independents did now,
in contradi&s;tinction to the pre&s;byterians, a&s;&s;ume this
magnificent appellation, and arrogate all the a&s;cendant,
which naturally belongs to it.</P>
<P>HEARING of parties in the hou&s;e of commons, and
being informed, that the minority were friends to the
army, the majority enemies; the troops naturally inte|re&s;ted
them&s;elves in that dangerous di&s;tinction, and were
eager to give the &s;uperiority to their partizans. What|ever
hard&s;hips they underwent, though perhaps derived
from inevitable nece&s;&s;ity, were a&s;cribed to a &s;ettled de|&s;ign
of oppre&s;&s;ing them, and re&s;ented as an effect of the
animo&s;ity and malice of their antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="127">
NOTWITHSTANDING the great revenue, which ac|crued
from taxes, a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, &s;eque&s;trations, and com|po&s;itions,
con&s;iderable arrears were due to the army;
and many of the private men, as well as officers, had
near a twelvemonth's pay &s;till owing them. The army
&s;u&s;pected, that this deficiency was purpo&s;ely contrived,
in order to oblige them to live on free quarter; and, by
rendering them odious to the country, $erve as a pre|tence
for di&s;banding them. When they &s;aw &s;uch mem|bers,
as were employed in committees and civil offices,
accumulate great fortunes, they accu&s;ed them of rapine
and public plunder. And, as no plan was pointed out
by the commons for the payment of arrears, the &s;oldiers
dreaded, that, after they &s;hould be di&s;banded or em|barked
for Ireland, their enemies, who predominated in
the two hou&s;es, would intirely defraud them of their
right, and oppre&s;s them with impunity.</P>
<P>ON this ground or pretence did the fir&s;t commotions
begin in the army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny of the army.</NOTE> A petition, addre&s;&s;ed to Fairfax the
general, was handed about; de&s;iring an indemnity, and
that ratified by the King, for any illegal actions, of
which, during the cour&s;e of the war, the &s;oldiers might
have been guilty; together with &s;atisfaction in arrears,
freedom from pre&s;&s;ing, relief of widows and maimed &s;ol|diers,
and pay till di&s;banded. The commons, aware of
what combu&s;tible materials the army was compo&s;ed,
were alarmed at this intelligence. Such a combination,
they knew, if not checked in its fir&s;t appearance, mu&s;t
be attended with the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences, and
mu&s;t &s;oon exalt the military above the civil authority.
Be&s;ides &s;ummoning &s;ome officers to an&s;wer for this at|tempt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 30.</NOTE>
they immediately voted, that the petition tended
to introduce mutiny, to put conditions upon the parlia|ment,
and to ob&s;truct the relief of Ireland; and they
threatened to proceed again&s;t the promoters of it, as ene|mies
to the &s;tate, and di&s;turbers of public peace. This

declaration, which may be e&s;teemed violent, e&s;pecially
as the army had &s;ome ground for complaint, produced
very fatal effects. The &s;oldiers lamented, That they
were deprived of the privileges of Engli&s;hmen; that they
were not allowed &s;o much as to repre&s;ent their grievan|ces;
that, while petitions from E&s;&s;ex and other places
were openly encouraged again&s;t the army, their mouths
were &s;topped; and that they, who were the authors of
liberty to the nation, were reduced, by a faction in par|liament,
to the mo&s;t grievous &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;po&s;ition was the army found by Warwic,
Dacres, Ma&s;&s;ey, and other commi&s;&s;ioners; who were
&s;ent to make them propo&s;als for entering into the &s;ervice
of Ireland<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 457.</NOTE>. In&s;tead of inli&s;ting, the generality ob|jected
to the terms; demanded an indemnity; were cla|morous
for their arrears: And, though they expre&s;&s;ed
no di&s;&s;atisfaction again&s;t Skippon, who was appointed
commander, they di&s;covered much &s;tronger inclination
to &s;erve under Fairfax and Cromwel<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 458.</NOTE>. Some officers,
who were of the pre&s;byterian party, having entered into
engagements for this &s;ervice, could prevail on very few
of the &s;oldiers to inli&s;t under them. And, as they all
lay under the grievous reproach of de&s;erting the army,
and betraying the intere&s;ts of their companions; the re&s;t
were farther confirmed in that confederacy, which they
had formed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 461. 556.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To petition and remon&s;trate being the mo&s;t cautious
way of conducting a confederacy, an application to par|liament
was &s;igned by near 200 officers; in which they
made their apology with a very imperious air, a&s;&s;erted
their right of petitioning, and complained of that impu|tation
thrown upon them by the former declaration of
the lower hou&s;e<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 468.</NOTE>. The private men likewi&s;e of &s;ome
regiments &s;ent a letter to Skippon; in which, together
<PB N="89" REF="131">
with in&s;i&s;ting on the &s;ame topics, they lament, that de&s;igns
were formed again&s;t them and many of the godly party
in the kingdom; and declare, that they could not en|gage
for Ireland, till they were &s;atisfied in their expecta|tions,
and had their ju&s;t de&s;ires granted<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 474.</NOTE>. The army,
in a word, felt their power, and re&s;olved to be ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE parliament too re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible, to pre&s;erve
their dominion; but, being de&s;titute of power, and not
retaining much authority, it was not ea&s;y for them to
employ any expedient, which could contribute to their
purpo&s;e. The expedient, which they now made u&s;e of,
was the wor&s;t imaginable. They &s;ent Skippon, Crom|wel,
Ireton, and Fleetwood, to the head-quarters at
Saffron-Weldon in E&s;&s;ex; and empowered them to make
offers to the army, and inquire into the cau&s;e of its
<HI>di&s;tempers.</HI> The&s;e very generals, at lea&s;t the three la&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of May.</NOTE>
were &s;ecretly the authors of all the di&s;contents; and fail|ed
not to foment tho&s;e di&s;orders, which they pretended to
appea&s;e. By their &s;ugge&s;tion, a mea&s;ure was embraced,
which, at once, brought matters to extremity, and ren|dered
the mutiny incurable.</P>
<P>IN oppo&s;ition to the parliament at We&s;tmin&s;ter, a mili|tary
parliament was formed. Together with a council
of the principal officers, which was appointed after the
model of the hou&s;e of peers; a more free repre&s;entative
of the army was compo&s;ed, by the election of two pri|vate
men or inferior officers, under the title of agitators,
from each troop or company<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 485. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 43.</NOTE>. By this means, both
the general humour of that time was gratified, intent on
plans of imaginary republics; and an ea&s;y method con|trived
for conducting underhand, and propagating the
&s;edition of the army.</P>
<P>THIS terrible court, when a&s;&s;embled; having fir&s;t de|clared,
<PB N="90" REF="132">
that they found no <HI>di&s;tempers</HI> in the army, but
many <HI>grievances,</HI> under which it laboured; immediately
voted the offers of the parliament un&s;atisfactory. Eight
weeks pay alone, they &s;aid, was promi&s;ed; a &s;mall por|tion
of fifty-&s;ix weeks, which they pretended to be their
due: No vi&s;ible &s;ecurity was given for the remainder&punc;
And having been declared public enemies by the com|mons,
they might hereafter be pro&s;ecuted as &s;uch, un|le&s;s
the declaration was recalled<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 497, 505. Whitlocke, p. 250.</NOTE>. Before matters came
to this height, Cromwel had po&s;ted up to London, on
pretence of laying before the parliament the ri&s;ing di&s;|contents
of the army.</P>
<P>THE parliament made one vigorous effort more, $word$
try the force of their authority: They voted, that all
the troops, which did not engage for Ireland, &s;hould in|&s;tantly
be di&s;banded in their quarters<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">$word$ vol. vii. p. 487.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame
time, the council of the army ordered a general rendez|vous
of all the regiments, in order to provide for their
common intere&s;ts. And while they thus prepared them|&s;elves
for oppo&s;ition to the parliament, they &s;truck $word$
blow, which at once decided the victory in their fa|vour.</P>
<P>A party of five hundred hor&s;e appeared at Holmby,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of June. The King &s;eized by Joyce.</NOTE>
conducted by one Joyce, who had once been a taylor
by profe&s;&s;ion; but was now advanced to the rank of cor|net,
and was an active agitator in the army. Without
being oppo&s;ed by the guard, who&s;e affections were all
on the &s;ame &s;ide; Joyce came into the King's pre&s;ence
armed with pi&s;tols, and told him, that he mu&s;t imme|diately

do &s;o,</HI> replied Joyce; <HI>but in the mean time the King mu&s;t
immediately go with me.</HI> Re&s;i&s;tance was vain. The King,
after protracting the time as long as he could, went into
his coach; and was &s;afely conducted to the army, who
were ha&s;tening to their rendezvous at Triplo-Heath near
Cambridge. The parliament, informed of this event by
their commi&s;&s;ioners, were thrown into the utmo&s;t con|&s;ternation<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 514, 515. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX him&s;elf was no le&s;s &s;urprized at the King's
arrival. That bold mea&s;ure, executed by Joyce, had
never been communicated to the general. The orders
were intirely verbal; and no body avowed them. And,
while every one affected a&s;toni&s;hment at the enterprize,
Cromwel, by who&s;e council it had been directed, ar|rived
from London, and put an end to their delibera|tions.</P>
<P>THIS artful and audacious con&s;pirator had conducted
him&s;elf in the parliament with &s;uch profound di&s;&s;imu|lation,
with &s;uch refined hypocri&s;y, that he had long de|ceived
tho&s;e, who, being them&s;elves very dextrous prac|titioners
in the &s;ame arts, naturally entertained the more
&s;u&s;picion again&s;t others. At every intelligence of di&s;|orders
in the army, he was moved to the highe&s;t pitch of
grief and of anger. He wept bitterly: He lamented the
misfortunes of his country: He advi&s;ed every violent
mea&s;ure for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the mutiny; and by the&s;e preci|pitant
<PB N="92" REF="134">
councils, at once &s;eemed to evince his own &s;ince|rity,
and inflamed tho&s;e di&s;contents, of which he in|tended
to make advantage. He obte&s;ted heaven and
earth, that his devoted attachment to the parliament had
rendered him &s;o odious in the army, that his life, while
among them, was in the utmo&s;t danger; and he had
very narrowly e&s;caped a con&s;piracy, formed to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate
him. But information being brought, that the mo&s;t
active officers and agitators were intirely his creatures,
the parliamentary leaders &s;ecretly re&s;olved, that, next
day, when he came to the hou&s;e, an accu&s;ation &s;hould
be entered again&s;t him, and he &s;hould be &s;ent to the
Tower<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 46.</NOTE>. Cromwel, who, in the conduct of his de|&s;perate
enterprizes, frequently approached to the very
brink of de&s;truction, knew how to make the requi&s;ite
turn with proper dexterity and boldne&s;s. Being informed
of this de&s;ign, he ha&s;tened to the camp; where he was
received with acclamations of joy, and was in&s;tantly in|ve&s;ted
with the &s;upreme command both of general and
army.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX, having neither talents him&s;elf for cabals,
nor penetration to di&s;cover the cabals of others, had
given his confidence intirely to Cromwel; who, by the
be&s;t coloured pretences, and by the appearance of an
open &s;incerity and a &s;crupulous con&s;cience, impo&s;ed on
the ea&s;y nature of this brave and virtuous man. The
council of officers and the agitators were moved altoge|ther
by Cromwel's direction, and conveyed his will to
the whole army. By his profound and artful conduct,
he had now attained a &s;ituation, where he could cover

le&s;t his counterfeit aver&s;ion might throw a damp upon
them, or his &s;ecret encouragement beget &s;u&s;picion in the

joined the army; and in the critical moment, &s;truck that
important blow of &s;eizing the King's per&s;on, and de|priving
the parliament of any re&s;ource by an accommo|dation
with him. Tho' one vizor fell off, another &s;till
remained, to cover his natural countenance. Where
delay was requi&s;ite, he could employ the mo&s;t indefa|tigable
patience: Where celerity was nece&s;&s;ary, he flew
to a deci&s;ion. And by thus uniting in his per&s;on the
the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite talents, he was enabled to combine the

Immediately after, it was laid a&s;ide by tacit

called their oppre&s;&s;ions the &s;poiling the Egyptians, and
their rigid &s;everity the dominion of the Elect, interlard|ed
all their iniquities with long and fervent prayers,
&s;aved them&s;elves from blu&s;hing by their pious grimaces,
and exerci&s;ed, in the name of the Lord, all their cruelty
on men. An undi&s;gui&s;ed violence could be forgiven:
But &s;uch a mockery of the under&s;tanding, &s;uch an abu&s;e
of religion, were, with men of penetration, objects of
peculiar re&s;entment.</P>
<P>THE parliament, con&s;cious of their decay in popula|rity,
&s;eeing a formidable armed force advance upon
them, were reduced to de&s;pair, and found all their re|&s;ources
much inferior to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. London
&s;till retained a &s;trong attachment to pre&s;byteriani&s;m;
and its militia, which was numerous, and had acquired
reputation in the wars, had, by a late ordinance, been
put into hands, in whom the parliament could intirely
confide. This militia were now called out, and ordered
to guard the line, which had been drawn about the city,
in order to &s;ecure it again&s;t the King. A body of hor&s;e
was ordered to be in&s;tantly levied. Many officers, who
had been ca&s;hiered by the new model of the army, offered
their &s;ervice to the parliament. An army of 5000 men
lay in the north under the command of General Pointz,
who was of the pre&s;byterian faction; but the&s;e were too
di&s;tant to be employed in &s;o urgent a nece&s;&s;ity. The
forces, de&s;tined for Ireland, were quartered in the we&s;t;
and, though deemed faithful to the parliament, they al|&s;o
lay at a di&s;tance. Many inland garri&s;ons were com|manded
by officers of the &s;ame party; but their troops,
being &s;o much di&s;per&s;ed, could, at pre&s;ent, be of no
manner of &s;ervice. The Scots were faithful friends and
zealous for pre&s;bytery and the covenant: but a very
long time was required, ere they could collect their
forces, and march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="142">
IN this &s;ituation it was thought more prudent to &s;ub|mit,
and by compliance to &s;top the fury of the enraged
army. The declaration, by which the military peti|tioners<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE>
had been voted public enemies, was recalled,
and erazed from the journal-book<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 503. 547. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 45.</NOTE>. This was the fir&s;t
&s;ymptom which the parliament gave of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and
the army, hoping, by terror alone, to effect all their
purpo&s;es, &s;topped at St. Albans, and entered into nego|tiation
with their ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>HERE commenced the encroachments of the military
upon the civil authority. The army, in their u&s;urpa|tions
on the parliament, copied exactly the model, which
the parliament had &s;et them, in their recent u&s;urpations
on the crown.</P>
<P>EVERY day, they ro&s;e in their demands. If one
claim was granted, they had another ready, &s;till more
enormous and exorbitant; and were determined never to
be &s;atisfied. At fir&s;t, they pretended only to petition
for what concerned them&s;elves as &s;oldiers: Next, they
mu&s;t have a vindication of their character: Then, it
was nece&s;&s;ary, that their enemies be puni&s;hed<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 509.</NOTE>: At la&s;t,
they claimed a right of modelling the whole govern|ment,
and &s;ettling the nation<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 567. 633. Ibid. vol. viii. p. 731.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEY pre&s;erved, in words, all deference and re&s;pect
to the parliament; but in reality, in&s;ulted them and
tyrannized over them. That a&s;&s;embly they pretended
not to accu&s;e: It was only evil coun&s;ellors, who &s;educed
and betrayed it.</P>
<P>THEY proceeded &s;o far as to name eleven members,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of June.</NOTE>
whom, in general terms, they charged with high trea|&s;on,
as enemies to the army and evil coun&s;ellors to the

William Waller, Sir John Maynard, Ma&s;&s;ey, Glyn,
Long, Harley, and Nichols<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 570.</NOTE>. The&s;e were the very
leaders of the pre&s;byterian party.</P>
<P>THEY in&s;i&s;ted, that the&s;e members &s;hould immediately
be &s;eque&s;tred from parliament, and be thrown into pri|&s;on<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 572.</NOTE>.
The commons replied, that they could not, up|on
a general charge, proceed &s;o far<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 592.</NOTE>. The army ob|&s;erved
to them, that the ca&s;es of Strafford and Laud
were direct precedents for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 594. Whitlocke, p. 259.</NOTE>. At la&s;t, the
eleven members them&s;elves, not to give occa&s;ion to di&s;|cord,
begged leave to retire from the hou&s;e: and the
army, for the pre&s;ent, &s;eemed &s;atisfied with this proof of
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 593, 594.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>PRETENDING, that the parliament de&s;igned to levy
war upon them, and to involve the nation again in blood
and confu&s;ion, they required, that all new levies &s;hould
be &s;topped. The parliament complied with this de|mand<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 572. 574.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE being no &s;igns of re&s;i&s;tance, the army, in order
to &s;ave appearances, removed, at the de&s;ire of the par|liament,
to a greater di&s;tance from London, and fixed
their head quarters at Reading. They carried the
King along with them in all their removes.</P>

had not &s;een the Duke of Gloce&s;ter, his younge&s;t &s;on,
and the Prince&s;s Elizabeth, &s;ince he left London, at
the commencement of the civil di&s;orders; nor the Duke
of York, &s;ince he went to the Scots army before New|ark.
No private man, unacquainted with the plea&s;ures
of a court, and the tumult of a camp, more pa&s;&s;ionately
loved his family&punc; than did this good Prince; and &s;uch
an in&s;tance of indulgence in the army was extremely
grateful to him. Cromwel, who was witne&s;s to the
meeting of the royal family, confe&s;&s;ed, that he never
had been pre&s;ent at &s;o tender a &s;cene; and he extremely
applauded the benignity, which di&s;played it&s;elf in the
whole di&s;po&s;ition and behaviour of Charles.</P>
<P>THAT artful politician, as well as the leaders of all
parties, payed court to the King; and fortune, not|with&s;tanding
all his calamities, &s;eemed again to &s;mile
upon him. The parliament, afraid of his forming &s;ome
accommodation with the army, &s;poke to him in a more
re&s;pectful &s;tyle than formerly; and invited him to re&s;ide
at Richmond, and contribute his a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;ettle|ment
of the nation. All the chief officers treated him
with great regard, and talked every where of re&s;toring
him to his ju&s;t powers and prerogatives. In the public de|clarations
of the army, the &s;ettlement of his revenue and
authority was in&s;i&s;ted on<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 590.</NOTE>. The royali&s;ts, every where,
entertained hopes of the re&s;toration of monarchy; and
the favour, which they univer&s;ally bore the army, con|tributed
very much to di&s;courage the parliament, and to
forward their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King began to feel of what con&s;equence he was.
The more the national confu&s;ions increa&s;ed, the more
was he confident, that all parties would, at la&s;t, have
recour&s;e to his lawful authority, as the only remedy for
the public di&s;orders. <HI>You cannot be without me,</HI> &s;aid he,
on &s;everal occa&s;ions: <HI>You cannot compo&s;e the nation but by
<PB N="101" REF="147">
my a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</HI> A people without government and without
liberty, a parliament without authority, an army with|out
a legal ma&s;ter: Di&s;tractions every where, terrors,
oppre&s;&s;ions, convul&s;ions: From this &s;cene of confu&s;ion,
which could not long continue, all men, he hoped,
would be brought to reflect on that antient government,
under which they and their ance&s;tors had &s;o long en|joyed
happine&s;s and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THOUGH Charles kept his ears open to all propo&s;als,
and expected to hold the ballance between the oppo&s;ite
parties, he entertained more hopes of accommodation
with the army. He had experienced the extreme rigour
of the parliament. They pretended totally to annihilate
his authority: They had confined his per&s;on. In both
the&s;e particulars, the army &s;howed more indulgence<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 303.</NOTE>.
None of his friends were debarred his pre&s;ence. And in
the propo&s;als, which the council of officers &s;ent for the
&s;ettlement of the nation, they in&s;i&s;ted neither on the
abolition of epi&s;copacy, nor on the puni&s;hment of the
royali&s;ts; the two points to which the King had the
mo&s;t extreme reluctance: And they demanded that a
period &s;hould be put to the pre&s;ent parliament, the event
for which he mo&s;t ardently longed.</P>
<P>HIS conjunction too &s;eemed more natural with the
generals, than with that u&s;urping a&s;&s;embly, who had &s;o
long a&s;&s;umed the entire authority of the &s;tate, and who
had declared their re&s;olution &s;till to continue ma&s;ters.
By gratifying a few per&s;ons with titles and preferments,
he might draw over, he hoped, the whole military
power, and, in an in&s;tant, rein&s;tate him&s;elf in his civil
authority. To Ireton he offered the lieutenancy of Ire|land:
To Cromwel, the garter, the title of Earl of
E&s;&s;ex, and the command of the army. Negotiations to
this purpo&s;e were &s;ecretly conducted. Cromwel pre|tended
to hearken to them; and was plea&s;ed to keep the
<PB N="102" REF="148">
door open for an accommodation, if the cour&s;e of events
&s;hould, at any time, render it nece&s;&s;ary. And the
King, who had no &s;u&s;picion, that one, born a private
gentleman, could entertain the daring ambition of &s;eiz|ing
a &s;ceptre, tran&s;mitted through a long line of mon|archs;
indulged hopes, that he would, at la&s;t, embrace
a mea&s;ure, which, by all the motives of duty, intere&s;t,
and &s;afety, &s;eemed to be recommended to him.</P>
<P>WHILE Cromwel allured the King by the&s;e expecta|tions,
he &s;till continued his &s;cheme of reducing the par|liament
to &s;ubjection, and depriving them of all means
of re&s;i&s;tance. To gratify the army, the parliament in|ve&s;ted
Fairfax with the title of general in chief of all the
forces in England and Ireland; and entru&s;ted the
whole military authority to a per&s;on, who, though well
inclined to their &s;ervice, was no longer at his own di&s;|po&s;al.</P>
<P>THEY voted, that the troops, which, in obedience
to them, had inli&s;ted for Ireland, and de&s;erted the re|bellious
army, &s;hould be di&s;banded, or, in other words,
be puni&s;hed for their fidelity. The forces in the north,
under Pointz, had already mutined again&s;t their gene|ral,
and had entered into an a&s;&s;ociation with that body
of the army, which was &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed in ex|alting
the military above the civil authority<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 620.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THAT no re&s;ource might remain to the parliament,
it was demanded, that the militia of London &s;hould be
changed, the pre&s;byterian commi&s;&s;ioners di&s;placed, and
the command re&s;tored to tho&s;e, who, during the cour&s;e
of the war, had con&s;tantly exerci&s;ed it. The parliament
even complied with &s;o violent a demand, and pa&s;&s;ed a
vote in obedience to the army<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 629. 632.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this unlimited patience, they propo&s;ed to tempo|rize
under their pre&s;ent difficulties, and they hoped to
<PB N="103" REF="149">
find a more favourable opportunity for recovering their
authority and influence: But the impatience of the city
lo&s;t them all the advantage of their cautious mea&s;ures.
A petition again&s;t the alteration of the militia was car|ried<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of July.</NOTE>
to We&s;tmin&s;ter, attended by the apprentices and &s;e|ditious
multitude, who be&s;ieged the door of the com|mons;
and by their clamour, noi&s;e, and violence,
obliged them to rever&s;e that vote, which they had pa&s;&s;ed
&s;o lately. When gratified in this preten&s;ion, they im|mediately

<P>NO &s;ooner was intelligence of this tumult conveyed
to Reading, than the army were put in motion. The
two hou&s;es being under re&s;traint, they were re&s;olved,
they &s;aid, to vindicate, again&s;t the &s;editious citizens,
the invaded privileges of parliament, and re&s;tore that a&s;|&s;embly
to its ju&s;t freedom of debate and council. In
their way to London, they were drawn up on Houn|$low-Heath;
a formidable army, twenty thou&s;and
&s;trong, and determined, without regard to laws or li|berty,
to pur&s;ue whatever mea&s;ures their generals &s;hould
dictate to them. Here the mo&s;t favourable event hap|pened,
to quicken and encourage their advance. The
&s;peakers of the two hou&s;es, Manche&s;ter and Lenthal,
attended with eight peers, and about &s;ixty commoners,
having &s;ecretly retired from the city, pre&s;ented them&s;elves
with their maces, and all the en&s;igns of their dignity;
and complaining of the violence put upon them, applied
to the army for defence and protection. They were re|ceived
with &s;houts and acclamations: Re&s;pect was paid
them as to the parliament of England: And the army
being provided of &s;o plau&s;ible a pretence, which, in all
public tran&s;actions, is of great con&s;equence, advanced
to cha&s;ti&s;e the rebellious city, and to re-in&s;tate the vio|lated
parliament<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 750. Claren|don, vol. v. p. 63.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="150">
NEITHER Lenthal nor Manche&s;ter were e&s;teemed in|dependents;
and &s;uch a &s;tep in them was intirely unex|pecked.
But they probably fore&s;aw, that the army mu&s;t,
in the end, prevail, and they were willing to pay court
in time to that authority, which began to predominate in
the nation.</P>
<P>THE parliament, forced from their temporizing mea|&s;ures,
and obliged to re&s;ign, at once, or combat for their
liberty and power, prepared them&s;elves with vigour for
defence, and determined to re&s;i&s;t the violence of the ar|my.
The two hou&s;es immediately cho&s;e new &s;peakers,
Lord Hun&s;don, and Henry Pelham: They renewed their
former orders for inli&s;ting troops: They appointed Ma&s;|&s;ey
to be commander: They ordered the trained bands
to mann the lines: And the whole city was in a ferment,
and re&s;ounded with military preparations<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. vii. p. 646.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN any intelligence arrived, that the army &s;topped
or retreated, the &s;hout of <HI>One and all,</HI> ran with alacrity,
from &s;treet to &s;treet, among the citizens: When news
came of their advancing, the cry of <HI>Treat and capitulate</HI>
was no le&s;s loud and vehement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 265.</NOTE>. The terror of an uni|ver&s;al
pillage, and even ma&s;&s;acre, had &s;eized the timid
inhabitants.</P>
<P>AS the army approached, Rain&s;borow, being &s;ent by
the general over the river, pre&s;ented him&s;elf before South-wark,
and was gladly received by &s;ome &s;oldiers, who were
quartered there for its defence, and who were re&s;olved
not to &s;eparate their intere&s;ts from tho&s;e of the army.<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Aug.</NOTE>
It behoved then the parliament to &s;ubmit. The army
marched in triumph through the city; but pre&s;erved the
greate&s;t order, decency, and appearance of humility.
They conducted to We&s;tmin&s;ter the two &s;peakers, who
took their &s;eats as if nothing had happened. The eleven
impeached members, being accu&s;ed as cau&s;es of the tu|mult,
were expelled; and mo&s;t of them retired beyond

the tumult till the return of the &s;peakers: The lines

<P>THE independent party exulted in their victory. The
whole authority of the nation, they imagined, was lodged
in their hands; and they had a near pro&s;pect of mould|ing
the government into that imaginary republic, which
had long been the object of their wi&s;hes. They had &s;e|cretly
concurred in all encroachments of the military
power; and they expected, by the terror of the &s;word,
to impo&s;e a more perfect &s;y&s;tem of liberty on the reluctant
nation. All parties, the king, the church, the parlia|ment,
the pre&s;byterians, had been guilty of errors, &s;ince
the commencement of the&s;e di&s;orders: But it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that this delu&s;ion of the independents and re|publicans
was, of all others, the mo&s;t contrary to com|mon
&s;en&s;e and the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims of policy. Yet
were the leaders of that party, Vane, Fiennes, St. John,
Martin, the men in England the mo&s;t celebrated for pro|found
thought and deep contrivance; and by their well-coloured
pretences and profe&s;&s;ions, they had over-reached
the whole nation. To deceive &s;uch men would argue a
&s;uperlative capacity in Cromwel; were it not, that, be|&s;ides
the great difference there is between dark, crooked
councils and true wi&s;dom, an exorbitant pa&s;&s;ion for rule
and authority will make the mo&s;t prudent overlook the
dangerous con&s;equences of &s;uch mea&s;ures as &s;eem to tend,
in any degree, to their own advancement.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="152">
THE leaders of the army, having e&s;tabli&s;hed their do|minion
over the parliament and city, ventured to bring
the King to Hampton-Court; and he lived, for &s;ome
time, in that palace, with an appearance of dignity and
freedom. Such admirable equability of temper did he
po&s;&s;e&s;s, that, during all the variety of fortune, which he
underwent, no difference was perceived in his counte|nance
or behaviour; and tho' a pri&s;oner, in the hands of
his mo&s;t inveterate enemies, he &s;upported, towards all
who approached him, the maje&s;ty of a monarch; and
that, neither with le&s;s nor greater &s;tate, than what he
had been accu&s;tomed to maintain. His manner, which
was not in it&s;elf popular nor gracious, now appeared
amiable, from its great meekne&s;s and equality.</P>
<P>THE parliament renewed their applications to him,
and pre&s;ented him with the &s;ame conditions, which they
had offered at Newca&s;tle. The king declined accepting
them, and de&s;ired the parliament to take the propo&s;als of
the army into con&s;ideration, and make them the founda|tion
of the public &s;ettlement<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 810.</NOTE>. He &s;till entertained
hopes, that his negotiations with the generals would be
crowned with &s;ucce&s;s; tho' every thing, in that parti|cular,
bore daily a wor&s;e a&s;pect. Mo&s;t hi&s;torians have
thought, that Cromwel never was &s;incere in his profe&s;|&s;ions;
and that, having, by force, rendered him&s;elf
ma&s;ter of the King's per&s;on, and, by fair pretences, ac|quired
the countenance of the royali&s;ts, he had employed
the&s;e advantages to the en&s;laving the parliament: And
afterwards thought of nothing but the e&s;tabli&s;hment of
his own unlimited authority, with which he e&s;teemed
the re&s;toration, and even life of the King, altogether in|compatible.
This opinion, &s;o much warranted by the
exorbitant ambition and profound di&s;&s;imulation of his
character, meets with ready belief; tho' 'tis more agree|able
to the narrowne&s;s of human views, and the darkne&s;s
<PB N="107" REF="153">
of futurity, to &s;uppo&s;e, that this daring u&s;urper was
guided by events, and did not, as yet, fore&s;ee, with any
a&s;&s;urance, that unparalleled greatne&s;s, which he after|wards
attained. Many writers of that age have a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Salmonet, Ludlow, Hollis, &amp;c. all the&s;e, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, being the declared inveterate enemies of Cromwel, are the more to be credited, when they advance any fact, which may &s;erve to apologize for his violent and cri|minal conduct. There prevails a &s;tory, that Cromwel intercepted a letter, wrote to the Queen, where the King &s;aid, that he would fir&s;t rai&s;e and then de&s;troy Cromwel. But, be&s;ides that this conduct &s;eems to contradict the character of the King, it is, on other accounts, totally unworthy of credit. It is fir&s;t told by Roger Coke, a very pa&s;&s;ionate and fooli&s;h hi&s;torian, who wrote too &s;o late as the revolution, and who mentions it only as a rumour. In the Memoirs of Lord Broghill, we meet with another &s;tory of an intercepted letter, which de&s;erves &s;ome more attention, and agrees very well with the nar|ration here given. It is thus related by Mr. Maurice, chaplain to Roger, Earl of Orrery. &startq;Lord Orrery, in the time of his greatne&s;s with Cromwel, ju&s;t after he had &s;o &s;ea&s;onably relieved him in his great di&s;tre&s;s at Clonmell, riding out of Youghall one day with him and Ireton, they fell into di&s;cour&s;e about the King's death. Cromwel thereupon &s;aid more than once, that if the King had followed his own judgment, and had been attended by none but tru&s;ty &s;ervants, he had fooled them all; and that once they had a mind to have clo&s;ed with him, but, upon &s;omething that happened, fell off from that de&s;ign. Orrery finding them in good humour, and be|ing alone with them, a&s;ked, if he might pre&s;ume to de&s;ire to know, why they would once have clo&s;ed with his Maje&s;ty, and why they did not. Cromwel very freely told him, he would &s;atisfy him in both his queries. The rea&s;on (&s;ays he) why we would have clo&s;ed with the King was this: We found that the Scotch and pre&s;byterians began to be more powerful than we, and were likely to agree with him, and leave us in the lurch. For this rea&s;on we thought it be&s;t to prevent them, by offering fir&s;t to come in upon rea&s;onable conditions: But whil&s;t our thoughts were taken up with this &s;ubject, there came a letter to us from one of our &s;pies, who was of the King's bed-chamber, acquainting us, that our final doom was decreed that very day; that he could not po&s;&s;ibly learn what it was, but we might di&s;cover it, if we could but intercept a letter &s;ent from the King to the Queen, wherein he informed her of his re&s;olution; that this letter was &s;owen up in the &s;kirt of a &s;addle, and the bearer of it would come with the &s;addle upon his head, about ten of the clock that night, to the Blue Boar in Holbourn, where he was to take hor&s;e for Dover. The me&s;&s;enger knew nothing of the letter in the &s;addle, tho' &s;ome in Dover did. We were at Wind&s;or (&s;aid Cromwel) when we received this letter, and imme|diately upon the receipt of it, Ireton and I re&s;olved to take one tru&s;ty fellow with us, and to go in troopers habits to that inn. We did &s;o; and leav|ing our man at the gate of the inn, (which had a wicket only open to let per&s;ons in and out) to watch and give us notice when any man came in with a &s;addle, we went into a drinking-&s;tall. We there continued, drinking cans of beer, till about ten of the clock, when our centinel at the gate gave us notice, that the man with the &s;addle was come. We ro&s;e up pre&s;ently, and ju&s;t as the man was leading out his hor&s;e &s;addled, we came up to him with drawn &s;words, and told him, we were to &s;earch all that went in and out there; but as he looked like an hone&s;t man, we would only &s;earch his &s;addle, and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s him. The &s;addle was ungirt; we carried it into the &s;tall, where we had been drinking, and ripping open one of the &s;kirts, we there found the letter we wanted. Having thus got it into our hands, we delivered the man (whom we had left with our centinel) his &s;addle, told him he was an hone&s;t fellow, and bid him go about his bu&s;ine&s;s; which he did, pur&s;uing his journey without more ado, and ignorant of the harm he had &s;uffered. We found in the letter, that his Maje&s;ty acquainted the Queen, that he was courted by both factions, the Scots pre&s;byterians and the army; and that tho&s;e which bade the faire&s;t for him &s;hould have him: but yet he thought he &s;hould clo&s;e with the Sco$ch &s;ooner than with the other. Upon this we returned to Wind&s;or; and finding we were not like to have good terms from the King, we from that time vowed his de&s;truc|tion.&endq; &startq;This relation &s;uiting well enough with other pa&s;&s;ages and circum|&s;tances at this time, I have in&s;erted to gratify the reader's curio&s;ity.&endq; Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 12.</NOTE>,

that he really intended to make a private bargain with
the King; a mea&s;ure, which carried the mo&s;t plau&s;ible
appearance both for his &s;afety and advancement: But
that he found in&s;uperable difficulties in reconciling to it
the wild humours of the army. The horror and antipa|thy
of the&s;e fanatics had, for many years, been artfully
fomented again&s;t Charles; and tho' their principles were,
on all occa&s;ions, ea&s;ily warped and eluded by private in|tere&s;t,
yet was &s;ome colouring requi&s;ite, and a flat con|tradiction
to all former profe&s;&s;ions and tenets could not
&s;afely be propo&s;ed to them. 'Tis certain, at lea&s;t, that
Cromwel made u&s;e of this rea&s;on, why he admitted rarely
of vi&s;its from the King's friends, and &s;howed le&s;s favour
than formerly to the royal cau&s;e. The agitators, he &s;aid,
had rendered him odious to the army, and had repre|&s;ented
him as a traitor, who, for the &s;ake of private in|tere&s;t,
<PB N="109" REF="155">
was ready to betray the cau&s;e of God to the great
enemy of piety and religion. De&s;perate projects too, he
a&s;&s;erted to be &s;ecretly formed, for the murder of the
King; and he pretended much to dread le&s;t all his autho|rity,
and that of the commanding officers, would not be able
to re&s;train the&s;e enthu&s;i&s;ts from their bloody purpo&s;es<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v p. 76.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>INTELLIGENCE being daily brought to the King of
menaces thrown out by the agitators; he began to think
of retiring from Hampton-Court, and of putting him|&s;elf
in &s;ome place of &s;afety. The guards were doubled
upon him: The promi&s;cuous concour&s;e of people re|&s;trained:
A more jealous care exerted in attending his
per&s;on: All, under colour of protecting him from dan|ger;
but really with a view of making him unea&s;y in
his pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The&s;e artifices &s;oon operated the
intended effect. Charles, who was naturally apt to be
&s;wayed by council, and who had not then acce&s;s to
any good council, took &s;uddenly a re&s;olution of with|drawing
him&s;elf, tho' without any concerted, at lea&s;t,
any rational &s;cheme, for the future di&s;po&s;al of his per|&s;on.
Attended only by Sir John Berkeley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Nov.</NOTE> A&s;hburn|ham,
and Leg, he privately left Hampton-Court; and
his e&s;cape was not di&s;covered, till near an hour after;
when tho&s;e who entered his chamber, found on the table
&s;ome letters directed to the parliament, to the general, and
to the officer, who had attended him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 871.</NOTE>. All night, he tra|velled
thro' the fore&s;t, and arrived next day at Tichfield, a
&s;eat of the Earl of Southampton, where the Counte&s;s dow|ager
re&s;ided, a woman of great honour, to whom, the King
knew, he might &s;afely entru&s;t his per&s;on. Before he ar|rived
at this place, he had gone to the &s;ea-coa&s;t; and
expre&s;&s;ed great anxiety, that a &s;hip, which he &s;eemed to
look for, had not arrived; and from thence, Berkeley
and Leg, who were not in the &s;ecret, conjectured, that
his intention was to tran&s;port him&s;elf beyond &s;ea.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="156">
THE King could not hope to remain long concealed
at Tichfield: What mea&s;ure &s;hould be next embraced,
was the que&s;tion. In the neighbourhood lay the i&s;le of
Wight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King flies to the i&s;le of Wight.</NOTE> of which Hammond was governor. This man
was entirely dependent on Cromwel. At his recom|mendation
he had married a daughter of the famous
Hambden, who, during his life-time, had b$en an inti|mate
friend of Cromwel, and who&s;e memory was ever
religiou&s;ly re&s;pected by him. The&s;e circum&s;tances were
very unfavourable: Yet, becau&s;e the governor was ne|phew
to Dr. Hammond, the King's favourite chaplain,
and had acquired a good character in the army, it was
thought proper to have recour&s;e to him, in the pre&s;ent
exigence, when no other rational expedient could be
thought of. A&s;hburnham and Berkeley were di&s;patched
to the i&s;land. They had orders not to inform Hammond
of the place, where the King lay concealed, till they
had fir&s;t obtained a promi&s;e of him not to deliver up his
Maje&s;ty, tho' the parliament and army &s;hould require
him; but to re&s;tore him to his liberty, if he could not
defend him. This promi&s;e, it is evident, would have
been a very &s;lender &s;ecurity: Yet even without exacting
it, A&s;hburnham, imprudently, if not treacherou&s;ly,
brought Hammond to Tichfield; and the King was ob|liged
to put him&s;elf into his hands, and to attend him to
Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle in the i&s;le of Wight, where, tho'
received with great demon&s;trations of re&s;pect and duty,
he was in reality a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>LORD CLARENDON<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">P. 79, 80, &amp;c.</NOTE> is po&s;itive, that the King, when
he fled from Hampton-Court, had no intention of going
to this i&s;land: and indeed, all the circum&s;tances of that
hi&s;torian's narrative, which we have here followed,
&s;trongly favour this opinion. But there remains a letter
of Charles to the Earl of Leneric, &s;ecretary of Scotland;
in which he plainly intimates, that that mea&s;ure was
<PB N="111" REF="157">
voluntarily embraced, and even in&s;inuates, that, if he
had thought proper, he might have been in Jer&s;ey or any
other place of &s;afety<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are the words: &startq;Laneric; I wonder to hear (if that be true) that &s;ome of my friends &s;ay, that my going to Jer&s;ey would much more have furthered my per&s;onal treaty, than my coming hither, for which, as I &s;ee no colour of rea&s;on, &s;o I had not been here, if I had thought that fancy true, or had not been &s;ecured of a per&s;onal treaty; of which I nei|ther do, nor I hope will repent: For I am daily more and more &s;atisfied with the governor, and find the&s;e i&s;landers very good, peaceable, and quiet people. This encouragement I have thought not unfit for you to receive, hoping at lea&s;t it may do good upon others, tho' needle&s;s to you.&endq; Bur|net's Memoirs of Hamilton, p. 326. See al&s;o Ru&s;hworth, part 4. vol. ii. p. 941. All the writers of that age, except Clarendon, repre&s;ent the King's going to the i&s;le of Wight as voluntary and intended. Perhaps the King thought it little for his credit, to be trepanned into this mea&s;ure, and was more willing to take it on him&s;elf as intirely voluntary. Perhaps, he thought it would encourage his friends, if they thought him in a &s;ituation, which was not di&s;agreeable to him.</NOTE>. Perhaps, he &s;till confided in the
promi&s;es of the generals; and flattered him&s;elf, that, if
he were removed from the fury of the agitators, by which
his life was immediately threatened, they would execute
what they had &s;o often promi&s;ed in his favour.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the truth in this matter; for it
is impo&s;&s;ible fully to a&s;certain the truth; Charles was
never guilty of a weaker &s;tep, nor one more agreeable
to Cromwel and all his enemies. He was now lodged
in a place, removed from his partizans, at the di&s;po&s;al
of the army, whence it would be very difficult to deliver
him, either by force or artifice. And tho' it was always
in the power of Cromwel, whenever he plea&s;ed, to have
&s;ent him thither; yet &s;uch a mea&s;ure would have been
very invidious, if not accompanied with &s;ome danger.
That the King &s;hould voluntarily throw him&s;elf into the
&s;nare, and at once forfeit his own reputation of pru|dence,
and gratify his implacable per&s;ecutors, was
to them an incident peculiarly fortunate, and proved in
the i&s;&s;ue very fatal to him.</P>

CROMWEL, being now entirely ma&s;ter of the parlia|ment,
and free from all anxiety, with regard to the
King's per&s;on, applied him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly to quell tho&s;e
di&s;orders in the army which he him&s;elf had &s;o artfully
rai&s;ed, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully employed, again&s;t both King
and parliament. In order to engage the troops into a re|bellion
again&s;t their ma&s;ters, he had encouraged a very
arrogant &s;pirit among the inferior officers and private
men; and the camp, in many re&s;pects, carried more the
appearance of civil liberty than of military obedience.
The troops them&s;elves were formed into a kind of re|public;
and the plans of imaginary republics for the
&s;ettlement of the &s;tate, were, every day, the topics of
conver&s;ation among the&s;e armed legi&s;lators. Royalty it
was agreed to aboli&s;h: Nobility mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide: Even
all ranks of men be levelled; and an univer&s;al equality
of property, as well as power, be introduced among the
citizens. The &s;aints, they &s;aid, were the &s;alt of the
earth: An entire parity had place among the elect: And,
by the &s;ame rule, that the apo&s;tles were exalted from the
mo&s;t ignoble profe&s;&s;ions, the meane&s;t centinel, if en|lightened
by the &s;pirit, was entitled to equal regard with
the greate&s;t commander. In order to wean the &s;oldiers
from the&s;e licentious maxims, Cromwel had i&s;&s;ued or|ders
for di&s;continuing the meetings of the agitators; and
he pretended to pay intire obedience to the parliament&punc;
whom, being now reduced fully to &s;ubjection, he pro|po&s;ed
to make, for the future, the in&s;truments of his au$thority.
But the <HI>Levellers,</HI> for &s;o that party in the arm$

would not &s;o ea&s;ily be deprived of it. They &s;ecret$
continued their meetings: They a&s;&s;erted, that their of

were concerted: And every thing tended to total
anarchy and confu&s;ion. But this di&s;temper was &s;oon

<P>CROMWEL had great de&s;erence for the council of Ire|ton;
a man, who, having grafted the &s;oldier on the
lawyer, the &s;tate&s;man on the &s;aint, had adopted &s;uch
principles as were fitted to introduce the &s;evere&s;t tyranny,
while they &s;eemed to encourage the mo&s;t unbounded li|cence
in human &s;ociety. Fierce in his nature, tho' pro|bably
&s;incere in his intentions; he propo&s;ed by arbitrary
power to e&s;tabli&s;h liberty, and, in pro&s;ecution of his
imagined religious purpo&s;es, he thought him&s;elf di&s;pen&s;ed
from all the ordinary rules of morality, by which inferior
mortals mu&s;t allow them&s;elves to be governed. From
his &s;ugge&s;tion, Cromwel &s;ecretly called at Wind&s;or a
council of the chief officers, in order to deliberate con|cerning
the &s;ettlement of the nation, and the future di&s;|po&s;al
of the King's per&s;on<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 92.</NOTE>. In this conference, which
commenced with devout prayers, poured forth by Crom|wel
him&s;elf and other in&s;pired per&s;ons (for the officers
of this army received in&s;piration with their commi&s;&s;ion),
was fir&s;t opened the daring and unheard of council, of
bringing the King to ju&s;tice, and of puni&s;hing, by a ju|dicial
&s;entence, their &s;overeign for his pretended tyranny
and mal-admini&s;tration. While Charles lived, even tho'
re&s;trained to the clo&s;e&s;t pri&s;on, con&s;piracies, they knew,
<PB N="114" REF="162">
and in&s;urrections would never be wanting, in favour of
a prince, who was &s;o extremely revered and beloved by
his own party, and whom the nation in general began
to regard with great affection and compa&s;&s;ion. To
murder him privately was expo&s;ed to the imputation of
inju&s;tice and cruelty, aggravated by the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch
a crime; and every odious epithet of <HI>Traitor</HI> and <HI>A&s;&s;a&s;&s;in</HI>
would, by the general voice of mankind, be undi&s;put|ably
a&s;cribed to the actors of &s;uch a villany. Some un|expected
procedure mu&s;t be attempted, which would
a&s;toni&s;h the world by its novelty, would bear the &s;em|blance
of ju&s;tice, and would cover its barbarity by the
audaciou&s;ne&s;s of the enterprize. Striking in with the
fanatical notions of the intire equality of mankind, it
would en&s;ure the devoted obedience of the army, and
&s;erve as a general engagement again&s;t the royal family,
whom, by their open and united deed, they would &s;o
heinou&s;ly affront and injure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The following was a very favourite text among the enthu&s;ia&s;ts of that age. &startq;Let the high prai&s;es of God be in the mouths of his &s;aints, and a twofold &s;word in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the heathen and puni&s;hment upon the people; to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgments written: This honour have all his &s;aints.&endq; P&s;alm cxlix. ver. 6, 7, 8, 9.

<P>THIS mea&s;ure, therefore, being &s;ecretly re&s;olved on, it was
requi&s;ite, by degrees, to make the parliament adopt it, and to
conduct them from violence to violence; till this la&s;t act of
atrocious iniquity &s;hould &s;eem, in a manner, wholly inevit|able.
The King, in order to remove tho&s;e fears and jea|lou&s;ies,
which were perpetually pleaded as rea&s;ons for every
inva&s;ion of the con&s;titution, had offered, by a me&s;&s;age,
&s;ent from Cari&s;broke-ca&s;tle, to re&s;ign, during his own
life, the power of the militia and the nomination to all
the great offices; provided, that, after his death, the&s;e
prerogatives &s;hould again revert to the crown<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 880.</NOTE>: But the
<PB N="115" REF="163">
parliament acted intirely as victors and enemies; and, in
all their tran&s;actions with him, payed no longer any re|gard
to equity or rea&s;on. At the in&s;tigation of the in|dependents
and army, they neglected this offer, and
framed four propo&s;itions, which they &s;ent him as preli|minaries;
and, before they would deign to treat, they
demanded his po&s;itive a&s;&s;ent to all of them. By one, he
was required to inve&s;t the parliament with the military
power for twenty years, together with an authority to
levy whatever money &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary for exerci&s;ing
it: And even after the twenty years &s;hould be elap&s;ed,
they re&s;erved a right of rea&s;&s;uming the &s;ame authority,
whenever they &s;hould declare the &s;afety of the kingdom
to require it. By the &s;econd, he mu&s;t recall all his pro|clamations
and declarations again&s;t the parliament, and
acknowlege that a&s;&s;embly to have taken arms for their
ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary defence. By the third, he was to an|null
all the acts, and void all the patents of peerage,
which had pa&s;&s;ed the great &s;eal, &s;ince it had been carried
from London by Lord-Keeper Littleton. By the fourth,
he gave the two hou&s;es power to adjourn as they thought
fit: A demand &s;eemingly of no great con&s;equence; but
contrived by the independents, that they might be able
to remove the parliament to places, where it &s;hould re|main
in perpetual &s;ubjection to the army<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 88.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King regarded the preten&s;ion as mo&s;t unu&s;ual<NOTE PLACE="marg">1648.</NOTE>
and exorbitant, that he &s;hould make &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions,
while in&s;ecure of any &s;ettlement; and &s;hould blindly
tru&s;t his enemies for the conditions, which they were
afterwards to grant him. He required, therefore, a per|&s;onal
treaty with the parliament, and de&s;ired that all the
terms, on both &s;ides, &s;hould be adju&s;ted, before any
conce&s;&s;ions, on either &s;ide, &s;hould be in&s;i&s;ted on. The
republican party in the hou&s;e pretended to take fire at
<PB N="116" REF="164">
this an&s;wer; and openly inveighed, in the mo&s;t virulent
terms, again&s;t the per&s;on and government of the King;
who&s;e name, hitherto, had commonly, in all debates,
been mentioned with &s;ome degree of reverence. Ireton,
&s;eeming to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of the army, under the appel|lation
of many thou&s;and godly men, who had ventured
their lives in defence of the parliament, &s;aid, That the
King, by denying the four bills, had refu&s;ed &s;afety and
protection to his people; that their obedience to him
was but a reciprocal duty for his protection of them;
and that, as he had failed on his part, they were freed
from all obligations to allegiance, and mu&s;t &s;ettle the
nation, without con&s;ulting any longer &s;o mi&s;guided a
prince<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cl. Walker, p. 70.</NOTE>. Cromwel, after giving an ample character of
the valour, good affections, and godline&s;s of the army,
&s;ubjoined, That it was expected the parliament &s;hould
govern and defend the kingdom by their own power and
re&s;olutions, and not accu&s;tom the people any longer to
expect &s;afety and government from an ob&s;tinate man,
who&s;e heart God had hardened; that tho&s;e, who, at the
expence of their blood, had hitherto defended the par|liament
from &s;o many dangers, would &s;till continue,
with fidelity and courage to protect them again&s;t all op|po&s;ition,
in this vigorous mea&s;ure. &startq;Teach them not,&endq;
added he, &startq;by your neglecting your own &s;afety and
that of the kingdom (in which theirs too is involved)
to imagine them&s;elves betrayed, and their intere&s;t
abandoned to the rage and malice of an irreconcilable
enemy, whom, for your &s;ake, they have dared to
provoke. Beware, (<HI>and at the&s;e words he laid his hand
on his &s;word</HI>) beware, le&s;t de$pair cau&s;e them to &s;eek

Such arguments prevailed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Jan.</NOTE> though ninety-one members
had &s;till the courage to oppo&s;e. It was voted, that no more
<PB N="117" REF="165">

be received from him; and that it be trea&s;on for
any one, without leave of the two hou&s;es, to have any
intercour&s;e with him. The Lords concurred in the
&s;ame ordinance<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 965. 967.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY this vote of non-addre&s;&s;es, for &s;o it was called, the
King was, in reality, dethroned, and the whole con&s;ti|tution
formally overthrown. So violent a mea&s;ure was
&s;upported by a declaration no le&s;s violent. The blacke&s;t
calumnies were there thrown upon the King; &s;uch as,
even in their famous remon&s;trance, the commons thought
proper to omit, as incredible and extravagant: The
poi&s;oning his father, the betraying Rochelle, the con|triving
the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. viii. p. 998. Clarendon, vol. v. p. 93.</NOTE>. By bla&s;ting his &s;ame, had
that injury been in their power, they formed a very pro|per
prelude to the murthering of his per&s;on.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had the King refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to the four
bills, than Hammond, by orders from the army, remov|ed
all his &s;ervants, cut off all his corre&s;pondence with
his friends, and &s;hut him up in clo&s;e confinement. The
King afterwards &s;howed to Sir Philip Warwick, a decre|pid
old man, who, he &s;aid, was employed to kindle his
fire, and was the be&s;t company he enjoyed, during &s;eve|ral
months that this rigorous confinement la&s;ted<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Warwick, 329.</NOTE>. No
amu&s;ement was allowed him, or &s;ociety, which might
relieve his anxious thoughts: To be &s;peedily poi&s;oned
or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated was the only pro&s;pect, which he had, every
moment, before his eyes: For he entertained no appre|hen&s;ion
of a judicial &s;entence and execution, an event,
of which no hi&s;tory hitherto furni&s;hed an example.
Meanwhile the parliament were very indu&s;trious in pub|li&s;hing,

&s;uch benignity and con&s;tancy had not been more proper
to inflame, than allay, the general compa&s;&s;ion of the
people. The great &s;ource, whence the King derived
con&s;olation amid&s;t all his calamities, was undoubtedly
religion; a principle, which, in him, &s;eems to have
contained nothing $ierce nor gloomy, nothing which en|raged
him again&s;t his adver&s;aries, or terrified him with
the di&s;mal pro&s;pect of futurity. While every thing
around him bore a ho&s;tile a&s;pect; while friends, family,
relations, whom he pa&s;&s;ionately loved, were placed at a
di&s;tance, and unable to &s;erve him; he repo&s;ed him&s;elf
with confidence in the arms of that Being, who pene|trates
and &s;u&s;tains all nature, and who&s;e &s;everities, if re|ceived
with piety and re&s;ignation, he regarded as the
&s;ure&s;t pledge of unexhau&s;ted favour.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Second civil war.</NOTE> THE parliament and army, meanwhile, enjoyed not,
in tranquillity, that power, which they had obtained
with &s;o much violence and inju&s;tice. Combinations and
con&s;piracies, they were &s;en&s;ible, were every where form|ing
around them; and Scotland, whence the King's
cau&s;e had received the fir&s;t fatal blow, &s;eemed now to
promi&s;e it &s;upport and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BEFORE the delivery of the King's per&s;on at New-ca&s;tle,
and much more, &s;ince that event, the &s;ubjects of
di&s;content had been daily multiplying between the two
kingdoms. The independents, who began to prevail,
took all occa&s;ions of mortifying the Scots, whom the
pre&s;byterians looked on with the greate&s;t affection and
veneration. When the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, who, join|ed
to a committee of Engli&s;h lords and commons, had
managed the war, were ready to depart, it was propo&s;ed
in parliament to give them thanks for their civilities and
good offices. The independents prevailed, that the
words, <HI>Good offices,</HI> &s;hould be &s;truck out; and thus the
<PB N="119" REF="169">
whole brotherly friend&s;hip and intimate alliance with
the Scots, re&s;olved it&s;elf into an acknowlegement of
their being well-bred gentlemen.</P>
<P>THE advance of the army to London, the &s;ubjection
of the parliament, the &s;eizing of the King at Holmby,
his confinement in Cari&s;broke ca&s;tle, were &s;o many
blows, &s;en&s;ibly felt by that nation; as threatening the
final overthrow of pre&s;bytery, to which they were &s;o
pa&s;&s;ionately devoted. The covenant was profanely call|ed,
in the hou&s;e of commons, an almanack out of
date<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cl. Walker, p. 80.</NOTE>; and that impiety, though complained of, had
pa&s;&s;ed uncen&s;ured. In&s;tead of being able to determine
and e&s;tabli&s;h orthodoxy by the &s;word and by penal &s;ta|tutes,
they &s;aw the &s;ectarian army, who were ab&s;olute
ma&s;ters, claim an unbounded liberty of con&s;cience,
which the pre&s;byterians regarded with the utmo&s;t hor|ror.
All the violences, put on the King, they loudly
blamed, as repugnant to the covenant, by which they
&s;tood engaged to defend his royal per&s;on. And tho&s;e
very actions, of which they them&s;elves had been guilty,
they denominated trea&s;on and rebellion, when executed
by an oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>THE Earls of Loudon, Lauderdale, and Laneric, who
were &s;ent to London, prote&s;ted again&s;t the four propo&s;i|tions;
as containing too great a diminution of the
King's civil power, and providing no &s;ecurity for reli|gion.
They complained, that, notwith&s;tanding this
prote&s;tation, the propo&s;itions were &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on; con|trary
to the &s;olemn league, and to the treaty between
the two nations. And when they accompanied the Eng|li&s;h
commi&s;&s;ioners to the i&s;le of Wight, they &s;ecretly
formed a treaty with the King, for arming Scotland in

THREE parties, at that time, prevailed in Scotland.
The <HI>Royali&s;ts,</HI> who in&s;i&s;ted upon the re&s;toration of the
King's authority, without any regard to religious &s;ects
or tenets. Of the&s;e Montro&s;e, though ab&s;ent, was re|garded
as the head.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Inva&s;ion from Scot|land.</NOTE> The <HI>Rigid pre&s;byterians,</HI> who hated
the King, even more than they abhorred toleration;
and who determined to give him no a&s;&s;i&s;tance, till he
&s;hould &s;ign the covenant: The&s;e were governed by
Argyle. The <HI>Moderate pre&s;byterians,</HI> who endeavoured
to reconcile the intere&s;ts of religion and of the crown,
and hoped, by &s;upporting the pre&s;byterian party in Eng|land,
to &s;uppre&s;s the &s;ectarian army, and to re-in&s;tate
the parliament, as well as King, in their ju&s;t freedom
and authority: The two brothers, Hamilton and Lane|ric,
were leaders of this party.</P>
<P>WHEN Pendennis ca&s;tle was &s;urrendered to the parlia|mentary
army, Hamilton, who then obtained his liberty,
returned into Scotland; and being generou&s;ly determined
to remember antient favours, more than recent injuries,
he immediately embraced, with zeal and &s;ucce&s;s, the
protection of the royal cau&s;e. He obtained a vote
from the parliament to arm 40,000 men in &s;upport of
the King's authority, and to call over a con&s;iderable
body under Monro, who commanded the Scots forces in
Ul&s;ter. And though he openly prote&s;ted, that the co|venant
was the foundation of all his mea&s;ures, he &s;ecret|ly
formed an alliance with the Engli&s;h royali&s;ts, Sir
Marmaduke Langdale and Sir Philip Mu&s;grave, who
&s;urprized Berwic and Carli&s;$c, and levied con&s;iderable
forces in the north of England.</P>
<P>THE general a&s;&s;embly, who &s;at at the &s;ame time, and
were guided by Argyle, dreaded the con&s;equence of
the&s;e mea&s;ures, and fore&s;aw, that the oppo&s;ite party, if
&s;ucce&s;sful, would effect the re&s;toration of monarchy,
without the e&s;tabli&s;hment of pre&s;bytery in England. To
join the King before he had &s;ub&s;cribed the covenant,
<PB N="121" REF="173">
was, in their eyes, to re&s;tore him to his honour before
Chri&s;t was re&s;tored to his<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 305.</NOTE>; and they thundered out
anathemas again&s;t every one, who payed obedience to
the parliament. Two &s;upreme independent judicatories
were erected in the kingdom; one threatening the people
with damnation and eternal torments, the other with
impri&s;onment, bani&s;hment, and military execution. The
people were di&s;tracted in their choice; and the arma|ment
of Hamilton's party, though &s;econded by all the
civil power, went on but &s;lowly. The royali&s;ts he
would not, as yet, allow to join him, le&s;t he might
give offence to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical party; though he &s;e|cretly
promi&s;ed them tru&s;t and preferment, &s;o &s;oon as
his army &s;hould advance into England.</P>
<P>WHILE the Scots were making preparations for the
inva&s;ion of England, every part of that kingdom was
agitated with tumults, in&s;urrections, con&s;piracies, di&s;|contents.
'Tis &s;eldom, that the people gain any thing
by revolutions in government; becau&s;e the new &s;ettle|ment,
jealous and in&s;ecure, mu&s;t commonly be &s;upport|ed
with more expence and &s;everity than the old: But
on no occa&s;ion was the truth of this maxim more &s;en&s;ibly
felt, than in the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of England. Com|plaints
again&s;t the oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;hip-money, again&s;t the
tyranny of the &s;tar-chamber, had rouzed the people to
arms: And having gained a compleat victory over the
crown, they found them&s;elves loaded with a multiplicity
of taxes, formerly unknown; and &s;carce an appearance
of law and liberty remained in the admini&s;tration. The
pre&s;byterians, who had chiefly &s;upported the war, were
enraged to find the prize, ju&s;t when it &s;eemed within
their reach, &s;natched by violence from them. The roy|ali&s;ts,
di&s;appointed in their expectations, by the cruel
treatment which the King received from the army, were
&s;trongly animated to re&s;tore him to liberty, and to recover
<PB N="122" REF="174">
the advantages which they had unfortunately lo&s;t. All
orders of men were inflamed with indignation at &s;eeing
the military prevail over the civil power, and King and
parliament at once reduced to &s;ubjection by a mercenary
army. Many per&s;ons of family and di&s;tinction, from
the beginning of the war, had adhered to the parliament:
But all tho&s;e were, by the new party, deprived of au|thority;
and every office was entru&s;ted to the mo&s;t ig|noble
part of the nation. A ba&s;e populace exalted above
their &s;uperiors: Hypocrites exerci&s;ing iniquity under the
vizor of religion: The&s;e two circum&s;tances promi&s;ed not
much liberty or lenity to the people; and the&s;e were
now found united, in the &s;ame u&s;urped and illegal admi|ni&s;tration.</P>
<P>THOUGH the whole nation &s;eemed to combine in their
hatred of military tyranny, the ends, which the &s;everal
parties propo&s;ed, were &s;o different, that little concert
was ob&s;erved in their in&s;urrections. Langhorne, Poyer$
and Powel, pre&s;byterian officers, who commanded bo|dies
of troops in Wales, were the fir&s;t who declared
them&s;elves, and drew together a con&s;iderable army in
tho&s;e parts, which were extremely devoted to the royal
cau&s;e. An in&s;urrection was rai&s;ed in Kent by young
Hales and the Earl of Norwich. Lord Capel, Sir
Charles Lucas, Sir George Li&s;le, excited commotions
in E&s;&s;ex. The Earl of Holland, who had &s;everal times
changed party, &s;ince the commencement of the civil
wars, endeavoured to a&s;&s;emble forces in Surrey. Pom|fr$t
ca&s;tle in York&s;hire was &s;urprized by Morrice. Lang|dale
and Mu&s;grave were in arms, and ma&s;ters of Berw$$
and Carli&s;le in the north.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;eemed the mo&s;t dangerous circum&s;tance, the
general &s;pirit of di&s;content had &s;eized the fleet. Seven|teen
&s;hips, lying in the mouth of the river, declared for
the King; and putting Rain&s;borow, their admiral,
<PB N="123" REF="175">
a&s;hore, &s;ailed over to Holland, where the Prince of
Wales took the command of them<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 137.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h royali&s;ts exclaimed loudly again&s;t Ha|milton's
delays, which they attributed to a refined po|licy
in the Scots; as if their intentions were, that all
the King's party &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and the vic|tory
remain intire to the pre&s;byterians. Hamilton, with
better rea&s;on, complained of the precipitate humour of
the Engli&s;h royali&s;ts, who, by their ill-timed in&s;urrec|tions,
forced him to march his army, before his levies
were compleated, or his preparations in any forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>NO commotions, beyond a tumult of the apprentices,
which was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, were rai&s;ed in London: The
terror of the army kept the citizens in &s;ubjection. The
parliament was &s;o over-awed, that they declared the Scots
to be enemies, and all who joined them, traitors.
Ninety members, however, of the lower hou&s;e had the
courage to di&s;&s;ent from this vote.</P>
<P>CROMWEL and the military council prepared them|&s;elves
with vigour and conduct for defence. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of the army was, at this time, 26,000 men;
but by inli&s;ting &s;upernumeraries; the regiments were
greatly augmented, and commonly con&s;i&s;ted of more
than double their &s;tated complement<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 284.</NOTE>. Colonel Horton
fir&s;t attacked the revolted troops in Wales, and gave
them a con&s;iderable defeat. The remnants of the van|qui&s;hed
threw them&s;elves into Pembroke, and were there
clo&s;ely be&s;ieged, and &s;oon after taken, by Cromwel.
Lambert was oppo&s;ed to Langdale and Mu&s;grave in the
north, and gained advantages over them. Sir Michael
Live&s;ey defeated the Earl of Holland at King&s;ton, and
pur&s;uing his victory, took him pri&s;oner at St. Neots.
Fairfax, having routed the Kenti&s;h royali&s;ts at Maid|&s;tone,
followed the broken army: And when they join|ed
<PB N="124" REF="176">
the E&s;&s;ex in&s;urgents, and threw them&s;elves into Col+che&s;ter;
he laid &s;iege to that place, which defended it|&s;elf
to the la&s;t extremity. A new $leet was manned,
and &s;ent out under the command of Warwic, to oppo&s;e
the revolted &s;hips, of which the Prince had taken the
command.</P>
<P>WHILE the forces were employed in all quarters, the
parliament regained its liberty, and began to act with its
wonted courage and &s;pirit. The members, who ha$
withdrawn from the terror of the army, returned; and
in$u&s;ing boldne&s;s into their companions, re&s;tored to the
pre&s;byterian party the a&s;cendant, which it had formerly
lo&s;t. The eleven impeached members were recalled$
and the vote, by which they were expelled, was rever&s;ed.
The vote too of non-addre&s;&s;es was replealed; and com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
five peers and ten commoners, were &s;ent to
Newport in the i&s;le of Wight, in order to treat with
the King<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, vol. v. p. 180. Sir Edward Walker's perfect Copies, p. 6.</NOTE>. He was allowed to &s;ummon &s;everal of his
friends, and old coun&s;ellors, that he might have their ad|vice
in this important tran&s;action<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ibid. P. 8.</NOTE>. The theologians on
both &s;ides, armed with their &s;yllogi&s;ms and citations, at|tended
as auxiliaries<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 8. 38.</NOTE>. By them, the flame had fir&s;t
been rai&s;ed; and their appearance was but a bad prog|no&s;tic
of its extinction. Any other in&s;truments &s;eemed
better adapted for a treaty of pacification.</P>
<P>WHEN the King pre&s;ented him&s;elf to this company,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Sept. Treaty of Newport.</NOTE>
a great and &s;en&s;ible alteration was remarked in his a&s;pect
from what it appeared the year before, when he re&s;ided
at Hampton Court: The moment his &s;ervants had been
removed, he had laid a&s;ide all care of his per&s;on, and
had allowed his beard and hair to grow, and to hang
di&s;hevelled and neglected. His hair was become almo&s;t
intirely gray; either from the decline of years, or from
that load of &s;orrows, under which he laboured, and
<PB N="125" REF="177">
which, though borne with con&s;tancy, preyed inwardly
on his &s;en&s;ible and tender mind. His friends beheld with
compa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps even his enemies, that <HI>Grey
and di&s;crowned head;</HI> as he him&s;elf terms it, in a copy of
ver&s;es, which the truth of the &s;entiment, rather than
any elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, renders very pathetic<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Memoirs of Hamilton.</NOTE>.
Having in vain endeavoured by courage to defend his
throne from his armed adver&s;aries, it now behoved him,
by rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion, to &s;ave &s;ome fragments of it
from the&s;e peaceful, and no le&s;s implacable negotiators.</P>
<P>THE vigour of the King's mind, notwith&s;tanding the
&s;eeming decline of his body, here appeared unbroken
and undecayed. The parliamentary commi&s;&s;ioners would
allow none of his council to be pre&s;ent, and refu&s;ed to
enter into rea&s;oning with any but him&s;elf. He alone,
during the tran&s;actions of two months, was obliged to
&s;u&s;tain the argument again&s;t fifteen men of the greate&s;t
parts and capacity in both hou&s;es; and no advantage was
ever obtained over him<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Herbert's Memoirs, p. 72.</NOTE>. This was the &s;cene, above
all others, in which he was qualified to excel. A quick
conception, a cultivated under&s;tanding, a cha&s;te elocu|tion,
a dignified manner; by the&s;e accompli&s;hments he
triumphed in all di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of cool and temperate rea|&s;oning.
<HI>The King is much changed,</HI> &s;aid the Earl of Sali&s;bury
to Sir Philip Warwick: <HI>He is extremely improved of late.
No,</HI> replied Sir Philip; <HI>he was always &s;o: But you are
now at la&s;t &s;en&s;ible of it</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 324.</NOTE>. Sir Henry Vane, di&s;cour&s;ing
with his fellow-commi&s;&s;ioners, drew an argument from
the King's uncommon abilities, why the terms of pa|cification
mu&s;t be rendered more &s;trict and rigid<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Clarendon. Sir Edward Walker, p. 319.</NOTE>. But
Charles's capacity &s;hone not equally in action as in rea|&s;oning.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t point in&s;i&s;ted on by the parliamentary
commi&s;&s;ioners, was the King's recalling all his procla|mations
<PB N="126" REF="178">
and declarations again&s;t the parliament, and the
acknowledging, that they had taken arms in their own
defence. He frankly offered the former conce&s;&s;ion; but
long &s;crupled the latter. The fal&s;hood, as well as in|dignity
of that acknowledgment, begot in his brea&s;t an
extreme reluctance again&s;t it. The King had, no
doubt, in &s;ome particulars of moment, invaded, from$
&s;eeming nece&s;&s;ity, the privileges of his people: But hav|ing
renounced all claim to the&s;e u&s;urped powers, having
confe&s;&s;ed his errors, and having repaired every breach in
the con&s;titution, and even erected new ramparts, in or|der
to &s;ecure it; he could no longer, at the commence|ment
of the war, be repre&s;ented as the aggre&s;&s;or. How|ever
it might be pretended, that the former di&s;play of his
arbitrary inclinations, or rather his monarchical prin|ciples,
rendered an offen&s;ive or preventive war in the
parliament prudent and rea&s;onable; it could never, in
any propriety of &s;peech, make it be denominated a de|fen&s;ive
one. But the parliament, &s;en&s;ible, that the let|ter
of the law condemned them as rebels and traitors;
deemed this point ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for their future
&s;ecurity: And the King, finding, that peace could be
obtained on no other terms, at la&s;t yielded to it. He
only entered a prote&s;t, which was admitted; that no
conce&s;&s;ion, made by him, &s;hould be valid, unle&s;s the
whole treaty of pacification was concluded<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 11, 12. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HE agreed, that the parliament &s;hould retain, during
the term of twenty years, the power of the militia and
army, and of levying what money they plea&s;ed for their
&s;upport. He even yielded to them the right of re&s;um|ing,
at any time afterwards, this authority, whenever
they &s;hould declare &s;uch a re&s;umption requi&s;ite for pub|lic
&s;afety. In effect, the important power of the &s;word
was for ever ravi&s;hed from him and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. $word$ 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="179">
HE agreed, that all the great offices, during twenty
years, &s;hould be filled by both hou&s;es of parliament<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 78.</NOTE>.
He relinqui&s;hed to them the entire government of Ire|land,
and the conduct of the war there<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 45.</NOTE>. He renoun|ced
the power of the wards, and accepted of 100,000
pounds a year in lieu of it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 69. 77.</NOTE>. He acknowledged the va|lidity
of their great &s;eal, and gave up his own<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 56. 68.</NOTE>. He
abandoned the power of creating peers without con&s;ent
of parliament. And he agreed, that all the debts, con|tracted
in order to &s;upport the war again&s;t him, &s;hould
be paid by the people.</P>
<P>SO great were the alterations, made on the Engli&s;h
con&s;titution by this treaty, that the King &s;aid, not with|out
rea&s;on, that he had been more an enemy to his peo|ple
by the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, could he have prevented them,
than by any other action of his life.</P>
<P>OF all the demands of the parliament, Charles re$u&s;|ed
only two. Though he relinqui&s;hed almo&s;t every
power of the crown, he would neither give up his friends
to puni&s;hment, nor de&s;ert what he e&s;teemed his religi|ous
duty. The &s;evere repentance, which he had under|gone,
for abandoning Strafford, had, no doubt, con|firmed
him in the re&s;olution never again to be guilty of
a like error. His long &s;olitude and &s;evere afflictions had
contributed extremely to rivet him the more in tho&s;e re|ligious
principles, which had ever a con&s;iderable influ|ence
over him. His de&s;ire, however, of fini&s;hing an
accommodation induced him to go as far in both the&s;e
particulars, as he thought any way con&s;i&s;tent with his
duty.</P>
<P>THE e&s;tates of the royali&s;ts being, at that time, al|mo&s;t
intirely under &s;eque&s;tration, Charles, who could
give them no protection, con&s;ented, that they &s;hould
<PB N="128" REF="180">
pay &s;uch compo&s;itions, as they and the parliament could
agree on; and only begged, that they might be made
as moderate as po&s;&s;ible. He had not the di&s;po&s;al of of|fices;
and it &s;eemed but a &s;mall &s;acrifice to con&s;ent,
that a certain number of his friends &s;hould be rendered
incapable of public employments<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 61.</NOTE>. But when the par|liament
demanded a bill of attainder and bani&s;hment
again&s;t &s;even per&s;ons, the Marque&s;s of Newca&s;tle, Lord
Digby, Lord Biron, Sir Marmaduke Langdale, Sir Ri|chard
Granville, Sir Francis Doddington, and judge
Jenkins, the King utterly refu&s;ed compliance: Their
bani&s;hment for a limited time he was willing to agree
to<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 91. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>RELIGION was the fatal point about which the diffe|rences
had fir&s;t ari&s;en; and of all others, was the lea&s;t
&s;u&s;ceptible of compo&s;ition or moderation between the
contending parties. The parliament in&s;i&s;ted on the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of pre&s;bytery, the &s;ale of the chapter lands,
the abolition of all forms of prayer, and &s;trict laws
again&s;t the catholics. The King offered to retrench
every thing, which he did not e&s;teem of apo&s;tolical in|&s;titution:
He was willing to aboli&s;h archbi&s;hops, deans,
prebends, canons: He offered, that the chapter lands
&s;hould be let at low lea&s;es during ninety-nine years;
He con&s;ented, that the pre&s;ent church government &s;hould
continue during three years<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. $9. 35. 49.</NOTE>: After that time, he re|quired
not, that any thing &s;hould be re&s;tored to bi&s;hops
but the power of ordination, and even that power to be
exerci&s;ed by advice of the pre&s;byters<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 65.</NOTE>. If the parlia|ment,
upon the expiration of that period, was not
willing, all other branches of epi&s;copal juri&s;diction were
aboli&s;hed, and a new form of church government mu&s;t,
by common con&s;ent, be e&s;tabli&s;hed. The book of com|mon
<PB N="129" REF="181">
prayer he was willing to renounce, but required
the liberty of u&s;ing &s;ome other liturgy in his own cha|pel<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 75, 82. Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 1323.</NOTE>. A demand, which, though &s;eemingly very rea|&s;onable,
was po&s;itively refu&s;ed by the parliament.</P>
<P>IN the di&s;pute on the&s;e articles, one is not &s;urpri&s;ed,
that two of the parliamentary theologians &s;hould tell the
King, <HI>That if he did not con&s;ent to the utter abolition of epi&s;|c$pacy, he would be damned.</HI> But it is not without &s;ome
indignation, that we read the following vote of the
lords and commons. &startq;The hou&s;es, out of their dete&s;|tation
to that abominable idolatry u&s;ed in the ma&s;s, do
declare, that they cannot admit of, or con&s;ent unto any
&s;uch indulgence in any law, as is de&s;ired by his Ma|je&s;ty
for exempting the Queen and her family from
the penalties to be enacted again&s;t the exerci&s;e of the
ma&s;s<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Walker, p. 71.</NOTE>.&endq; The treaty of marriage, the regard to the
Queen's &s;ex and high &s;tation, even common humanity;
all con&s;iderations were undervalued, in compari&s;on of
their bigotted prejudices<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The King compo&s;ed a letter to the Prince, in which he related the whole cour&s;e of this tran&s;action, and accompanied his narrative with &s;everal wi&s;e, as well as pathetical reflections and advices. The words with which he con|cluded the letter, are remarkable. &startq;By what hath been &s;aid, you &s;ee how long I have laboured in the &s;earch of peace: Do not yo$ be di&s;heartened to tread in the &s;ame &s;teps. U&s;e all worthy means to re&s;tore your&s;elf to your rights, but prefer the way of peace: Show the greatne&s;s of your mind, rather to conquer your enemies by pardoning, than by puni&s;hing. If you &s;aw how unmanly and unchri&s;tian the implacable di&s;po&s;ition is in our ill|wi&s;hers, you would avoid that &s;pirit. Cen&s;ure me not for having parted with &s;o much of our right: The price was great; but the commodity was, &s;ecurity to us, peace to my people. And I am confident, that an|other parliament would remember, how u&s;eful a king's power is to a peo|ple's liberty; of how much power I dive&s;ted my&s;elf, that I and they might meet once again in a parliamentary way, in order to agree the bounds of prince and people. Give belief to my experience, never to af|fect more greatne&s;s or prerogative, than what is really and intrin&s;ically for the good of the subjects, not the &s;ati&s;faction of favourites. If you thus u&s;e it, you will never want means to be a father to all, and a bountiful prince to any, whom you incline to be extraordinarily gracious to. You may per|ceive, that all men entru&s;t their trea&s;ure, where it returns them intere&s;t; and if a prince, like the &s;ea, receive and repay all the fre&s;h &s;treams, which the rivers entru&s;t with him, they will not grudge, but pride them&s;elves, to make him up an ocean. The&s;e con&s;iderations, may make you as great a prince as your father is a low one; and your &s;tate may be &s;o much the more e&s;tabli&s;hed, as mine hath been &s;haken. For our &s;ubjects have learned, $word$ dare &s;ay, that victories over their princes, are but triumphs over them&s;elves, and &s;o, will more unwillingly hearken to changes hereafter. The Engli&s;h nation are a &s;ober people, however, at pre&s;ent, infatuated. I know not but this may be the la&s;t time, I may &s;peak to you or the world publickly. I am &s;en&s;ible into what hands I am fallen; and yet, I ble&s;s God, I have tho&s;e inward refre&s;hments, which the malice of my enemies cannot perturb. I have learned to bu&s;y my&s;elf, by retiring into my&s;elf; and therefore can the better dige&s;t whatever befals me; not doubting, but God's providence will re&s;train our enemies power, and turn their $iercene&s;s into his prai&s;e. To conclude, if God give you &s;ucce&s;s, u&s;e it humbly, and be ever far from re|venge. If he re&s;tore you to your right on hard conditions, whatever you promi&s;e, keep. The&s;e men, who have violated laws, which they were bound to pre&s;erve, will find their triumphs full of trouble.

IT was evidently the intere&s;t, both of King and par|liament,
to fini&s;h their treaty with all expedition; and
endeavour, by their combined forces, to re&s;i&s;t, if po&s;|&s;ible,
the $&s;urping fury of the army. It &s;eemed even
the intere&s;t of the parliament, to leave, in the king's
hand, a con&s;iderable &s;hare of authority, by which he
might be enabled to protect them and him&s;elf, from &s;o
dangerous an enemy. But the terms, on which they in|&s;i&s;ted,
were &s;o rigorous, that the King, fearing no wor&s;e
from the mo&s;t implacable enemies, was in no ha&s;te to come
to a conclu&s;ion. And &s;o great was the bigotry on both
&s;ides, that they were willing to &s;acrifice the greate&s;t civil
intere&s;ts, rather than relinqui&s;h the mo&s;t minute of their
theological contentions. From the&s;e cau&s;es, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
the artifice of the independents, the treaty was &s;pun out
to &s;uch a length, that the inva&s;ions and in&s;urrections
<PB N="131" REF="183">
were every where &s;ubdued; and the army had lei&s;ure to
execute their violent and &s;anguinary projects.</P>
<P>HAMILTON, having entered England with a numer|ous
tho' undi&s;ciplined army, dur&s;t not unite his forces<NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil war an inva&s;ion re|pre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE>
with tho&s;e of Langdale; becau&s;e the Engli&s;h royali&s;ts
had refu&s;ed to take the covenant; and the Scots pre&s;by|terians,
tho' engaged for the King, refu&s;ed to join them
on any other terms. The two armies marched together,
tho' at &s;ome di&s;tance; nor could even the approach of
the parliamentary army under Cromwel, oblige the co|venanters
to con&s;ult their own &s;afety, by a clo&s;e union
with the royali&s;ts. When principles are &s;o ab&s;urd and
&s;o de&s;tructive of human &s;ociety, it may &s;afely be affirm|ed,
that, the more &s;incere and the more di&s;intere&s;ted
they are, they only become the more ridiculous and
odious.</P>
<P>CROMWEL feared not to oppo&s;e 8000 men, to the
numerous armies of 20,000, commanded by Hamilton
and Langdale. He attacked the latter by &s;urprize, near
Pre&s;ton in Lanca&s;hire<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">17th of Augu&s;t.</NOTE>; and, tho' the royali&s;ts made a
&s;tout re&s;i&s;tance, yet, not being &s;uccoured in time by their
confederates, they were almo&s;t entirely cut in pieces.
Hamilton was next attacked, put to rout, and pur$ued
to Utoxeter, where he &s;urrendered him&s;elf pri&s;oner.
Cromwel followed his advantage; and marching into
Scotland with a con&s;iderable body, joined Argyle, who
was al&s;o in arms; and having &s;uppre&s;&s;ed Laneric, Monro,
and other moderate pre&s;byterians, he placed the power
entirely in the hands of the violent party. The eccle|&s;ia&s;tical
authority, exalted above the civil, exerci&s;ed
the &s;evere&s;t vengeance on all tho&s;e who had any &s;hare in
Hamilton's engagement; nor could any of that party re|cover
tru&s;t, or even live in &s;afety, but by doing &s;olemn
and public penance for taking arms, by authority of par|liament,
in defence of their lawful &s;overeign.</P>

THE chancellor, Loudon, who had, at fir&s;t, counte|nanced
Hamilton's enterprize, being terrified with the
menaces of the clergy, had, &s;ometime before, gone over
to the other party; and he now, openly in the church,
tho' inve&s;ted with the highe&s;t civil character in the king|dom,
did penance for his obedience to the parliament,
which he termed a carnal &s;elf-&s;eeking. He accompanied
his penance with &s;o many tears, and &s;uch pathetical ad|dre&s;&s;e&s;s
to the people for their prayers, in this his utter|mo&s;t
&s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s, that an univer&s;al weeping and

<P>THE loan of great &s;ums of money, often to the ruin
of families, was exacted of all &s;uch as lay under any
&s;u&s;picion of favouring the King's party, tho' their con|duct
had been ever &s;o inoffen&s;ive. This was a device,
fallen upon by the ruling party, in order, as they &s;aid,

known a more &s;evere and arbitrary government, than was

<P>THE &s;iege of Colche&s;ter terminated in a manner no
le&s;s unfortunate than Hamilton's engagement, for the
royal cau&s;e. After &s;uffering the utmo&s;t extremity of fa|mine,
after feeding on the vile&s;t aliments; the garri&s;on
de&s;ired, at la&s;t, to capitulate. Fairfax required them to
&s;urrender at mercy; and he gave &s;uch an explanation of
the&s;e terms, as to re&s;erve to him&s;elf power, if he plea&s;ed,
to put them all in&s;tantly to the &s;word. The officers en|deavoured,
tho' in vain, to per&s;uade the &s;oldiers, by
making a furious a&s;&s;ault, to break thro', or at lea&s;t, to
&s;ell their lives as dear as po&s;&s;ible. They were obliged<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1$th of Augu&s;t.</NOTE>
to accept of the conditions offered; and Fairfax, in&s;ti|gated
by Ireton, to whom Cromwel, in his ab&s;ence,
had con&s;igned over the government of the pa&s;&s;ive general,
&s;eized Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Li&s;le, and re|&s;olved
<PB N="133" REF="187">
to make them in&s;tant &s;acrifices to military ju&s;tice.
This unu&s;ual piece of &s;everity was loudly exclaimed
again&s;t by all the pri&s;oners. Lord Capel, fearle&s;s of
danger, reproached Ireton with it; and challenged him,
as they were all engaged in the &s;ame honourable cau&s;e,
to exerci&s;e the &s;ame impartial vengeance on all of them.
Lucas was fir&s;t &s;hot, and he gave, him&s;elf, orders to
fire, with the &s;ame alacrity, as if he had commanded a
platoon of his own &s;oldiers. Li&s;le in&s;tantly ran and ki&s;&s;ed
the dead body, and then chearfully pre&s;ented him&s;elf to
a like fate. Thinking that the &s;oldiers, de&s;tined for
his execution, &s;tood at too great a di&s;tance, he called to
them to come nearer: One of them replied, <HI>I'll war|r$nt
you, Sir, we'll hit you:</HI> He an&s;wered &s;miling, <HI>Friends,
I have been nearer you when you have mi&s;&s;ed me.</HI> Thus pe|ri&s;hed
this generous &s;pirit, not le&s;s beloved for his mo|de&s;ty
and humanity, than e&s;teemed for his courage and
military conduct.</P>
<P>SOON after, a gentleman, appearing in the King's pre|&s;ence,
clothed in mourning for Sir Charles Lucas; that
humane Prince, &s;uddenly recollecting the hard fate of his
friends, paid them a tribute, which none of his own un|paralleled

into a flood of tears<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e multiplied &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the army, they had
&s;ubdued all their enemies; and none remained but the
helple&s;s King and parliament, to oppo&s;e their violent
mea&s;ures. From Cromwel's &s;ugge&s;tion, a remon&s;trance
was drawn by the general council of officers, and &s;ent
to the parliament. They there complain of the treaty
with the King; demand his puni&s;hment for the blood
&s;pilt during the war; require a di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent
parliament, and a more equal repre&s;entative for the fu|ture;
and a&s;&s;ert, that, tho' &s;ervants, they are intitled to
<PB N="134" REF="188">
repre&s;ent the&s;e important points to their ma&s;ters, who
are them&s;elves no better than &s;ervants and tru&s;tees of the
people. At the &s;ame time, they advance with the army
to Wind&s;or,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;eized again by the army.</NOTE> and &s;end Colonel Eure to &s;eize the King's
per&s;on at Newport, and convey him to Hur&s;t ca&s;tle in
the neighbourhood, where he was reduced to very &s;trict
confinement.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure being fore&s;een &s;ome time before, the
King was exhorted to make his e&s;cape, which was con|ceived
to be very ea&s;y: But having given his word to
the parliament not to attempt the recovery of his liberty
during the treaty, and three weeks afterwards; he would
not, by any per&s;ua&s;ion, be induced to hazard the re|proach
of violating his promi&s;e. In vain was it urged,
that a promi&s;e, given to the parliament, could no longer
be binding; &s;ince they could no longer afford him pro|tection
from violence, threatened him by other per&s;ons,
to whom he was bound by no tye or engagement. The
King would indulge no refinements of ca&s;ui&s;try, how|ever
plau&s;ible, in &s;uch delicate &s;ubjects; and was re|&s;olved,
that whatever depredations fortune &s;hould com|mit
upon him, &s;he never &s;hould bereave him of his ho|nour<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Col. Cooke's Memoirs, p. 174. Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 1347.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE parliament lo&s;t not courage, notwith&s;tanding the
danger, with which they were &s;o nearly menaced. Tho'
without any plan for re&s;i&s;ting military u&s;urpations, they
generou&s;ly re&s;olved to with&s;tand them to the utmo&s;t; and
rather to bring on a violent and vi&s;ible &s;ubver&s;ion of go|vernment,
than lend their authority to tho&s;e illegal and
&s;anguinary mea&s;ures, which were projected. They &s;et
a&s;ide the remon&s;trance of the army, without deigning to
an&s;wer it; they voted the &s;eizing the King's per&s;on, to
be without their con&s;ent, and &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the ge|neral,
to know by what authority that enterprize had
<PB N="135" REF="189">
been executed; and they i&s;&s;ued orders, that the army
&s;hould advance no nearer London.</P>
<P>HOLLIS, the pre&s;ent leader of the pre&s;byterians, was
a man of the mo&s;t unconquerable intrepidity; and many
others of that party &s;econded his magnanimous &s;pirit. It
was propo&s;ed by them, that the generals and principal of|ficers,
&s;hould, for their di&s;obedience and u&s;urpations, be
proclaimed traitors by the parliament.</P>
<P>BUT the parliament were dealing with men, who
would not be frightened by words, nor retarded by any
&s;crupulous delicacy. The generals, under the name of
Fairfax, (for he &s;till allowed them to employ his name)
marched the army to London, and placing guards in
Whitehall, the Meu&s;e, St. James's, Durham-hou&s;e, Co|vent-garden,
and Palace-yard, &s;urrounded the parlia|ment
with their ho&s;tile armaments.</P>
<P>THE parliament, de&s;titute of all hopes of prevailing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">December 6. The hou&s;e purged.</NOTE>
retained, however, courage to re&s;i&s;t. They attempted,
in the face of the army, to clo&s;e their treaty with the
King; and, tho' they had formerly voted his conce&s;&s;ions
with regard to the church and delinquents to be un&s;ati&s;|factory,
they now took into con&s;ideration the final re&s;olu|tion
with regard to the whole. After a violent debate of
three days, it was carried, by a majority of 129 again&s;t
83, in the hou&s;e of commons, that the King's conce&s;|&s;ions
were a foundation for the hou&s;es to proceed upon in
the &s;ettlement of the kingdom.</P>
<P>NEXT day, when the commons were to meet, Colo|nel
Pride, formerly a drayman, had blockaded the hou&s;e,
at the head of two regiments; and, directed by the Lord
Grey of Groby, he &s;eized in the pa&s;&s;age, forty-one
members of the pre&s;byterian party, and &s;ent them to a
low room, which pa&s;&s;ed by the denomination of <HI>Hell;</HI>
whence they were afterwards carried to &s;everal inns.
Above 160 members more were excluded; and none
were allowed to enter but the mo&s;t furious and mo&s;t de|termined

of the independents; and the&s;e exceeded not
the number of fifty or &s;ixty. This atrocious inva&s;ion of
the parliament, commonly pa&s;&s;ed under the name of <HI>Co|lonel
Pride's purge;</HI> &s;o much di&s;po&s;ed were the nation to
make merry with the dethroning of tho&s;e members, who
had violently arrogated the whole authority of govern|ment,
and deprived the King of his legal prerogatives.</P>
<P>THE &s;ub&s;equent acts of the parliament, if this dimi|nutive
a&s;&s;embly de&s;erves that honourable name, retain
not the lea&s;t appearance of law, equity, or freedom.
They in&s;tantly rever&s;ed the former vote, and declared
the King's conce&s;&s;ions un&s;atisfactory. They determined,
that no members, ab&s;ent at this la&s;t vote, &s;hould be re|ceived,
till they &s;ub&s;cribed it, as agreeable to their judg|ment.
They renewed their former vote of non-addre&s;&s;es.
And they committed to pri&s;on, Sir William Waller,
Sir John Clotworthy, the generals, Ma&s;&s;ey, Brown, and
Copley, and other leaders of the pre&s;byterians. The&s;e
men, by their credit and authority, which was then very
high, had, at the commencement of the war, &s;upported
the parliament; and thereby prepared the way for the
greatne&s;s of the pre&s;ent leaders, who, at that time, were
of very &s;mall account in the nation.</P>
<P>THE &s;ecluded members having publi&s;hed a paper, con|taining
a narrative of the violence, which had been ex|erci&s;ed
upon them, and a prote&s;tation, that all acts were
void, which, from that time, had been tran&s;acted in
the hou&s;e of commons; the remaining members encoun|tered
it with a declaration, in which they pronounced it
fal&s;e, &s;candalous, &s;editious, and tending to the de&s;truc|tion
of the vi&s;ible and fundamental government of the
kingdom.</P>
<P>THESE &s;udden and violent revolutions held the whole
nation in terror and a&s;toni&s;hment. Every man dreaded
to be trampled under foot, in the contention between
tho&s;e mighty powers, which di&s;puted for the &s;overeignty
<PB N="137" REF="193">
of the &s;tate. Many began to withdraw their effects be|yond
&s;ea: Foreigners &s;crupled to give any credit to a
people, &s;o torn by dome&s;tic factions, and oppre&s;&s;ed by
military u&s;urpation: Even the internal commerce of the
kingdom began to &s;tagnate: And in order to remedy
the&s;e growing evils, the generals, in the army's name,
publi&s;hed a declaration, in which they expre&s;&s;ed their re|&s;olution
of &s;upporting law and ju&s;tice<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h. vol. viii. p. 1364.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE more to quiet the minds of men, the council of
officers took into con&s;ideration, a &s;cheme called <HI>The
agreement of the people;</HI> being the plan of a republic, to
be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of that government which
they had &s;o violently pulled in pieces. Many parts of
this &s;cheme, for correcting the inequalities of the repre|&s;entative,
are very plau&s;ible; had the nation been will|ing
to receive it, or had the army intended to impo&s;e it.
Other parts are too perfect for human nature, and &s;a|vour
&s;trongly of that fanatical &s;pirit &s;o prevalent through|out
the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE height of all iniquity and fanatical extravagance
yet remained; the public trial and execution of their &s;o|vereign.
To this period was every mea&s;ure precipitated
by the zealous independents. The parliamentary leaders
of that party had intended, that the army &s;hould, them|&s;elves,
execute that daring enterprize; and they deemed
&s;o irregular and lawle&s;s a deed, be&s;t fitted to &s;uch irre|gular
and lawle&s;s in&s;truments<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>. But the generals were
too wi$e, to load them&s;elves &s;ingly with the infamy,
which, they knew, mu&s;t attend an action, &s;o &s;hocking
to the general &s;entiments of mankind. The parliament,
they were re&s;olved, &s;hould &s;hare with them the reproach
of a mea&s;ure, which was thought requi&s;ite for the ad|vancement
of their common ends of &s;afety and ambi|tion.
In the hou&s;e of commons, therefore, a committee
<PB N="138" REF="194">
was appointed to bring in a charge again&s;t the King.
On their report a vote pa&s;&s;ed, declaring it trea&s;on in $word$
king, to levy war again&s;t his parliament, and appointing
a HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE to try his Maje&s;ty for this
new invented trea&s;on. This vote was &s;ent up to the
hou&s;e of peers.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of peers, during the civil wars, had, all
along, been of &s;mall account; but it had lately, &s;ince
the King's fall, become totally contemptible; and very
$ew members would &s;ubmit to the mortification of at|tending
it. It happened, that day, to be fuller than
u&s;ual, and they were a&s;&s;embled to the number of &s;ix|teen.
Without one di&s;&s;enting voice, and almo&s;t without
deliberation, they in&s;tantly rejected the vote of the lower
hou&s;e, and adjourned them&s;elves for ten days; hoping,
that this delay would be able to retard the furious career
of the commons.</P>
<P>THE commons were not to be &s;topped by &s;o &s;mall an
ob&s;tacle. Having fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed a principle, which is
noble in it&s;elf, and &s;eems &s;pecious, but is belied by all
hi&s;tory and experience, <HI>That the people are the origin of all
ju&s;t power;</HI> they likewi&s;e declared, that the commons of
England, a&s;&s;embled in parliament, being cho&s;en by the
people, and repre&s;enting them, have the &s;upreme autho|rity
of the nation, and that whatever is enacted and de|clared
law by the commons, hath the force of law, with|out
the con&s;ent of king or hou&s;e of peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">January 4.</NOTE> The ordi|nance
for the trial of Charles Stuart, king of England,
&s;o they called him, was again read and unanimou&s;ly a&s;|&s;ented

<P>IN proportion to the enormity of the violences and
u&s;urpations, were augmented the pretences of &s;anctity,
among tho&s;e regicides. &startq;Should any one have volun|tarily
propo&s;ed,&endq; &s;aid Cromwel in the hou&s;e, &startq;to

him as the greate&s;t traytor; but, &s;ince providence
and nece&s;&s;ity have ca&s;t us upon it, I will pray to God
for a ble&s;&s;ing on your councils; tho' I am not pre|pared
to give you any advice on this important occa|&s;ion.
Even I my&s;elf,&endq; &s;ubjoined he, &startq;when I was
lately offering up petitions for his Maje&s;ty's re&s;tora|tion,
felt my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,
and con&s;idered this &s;upernatural movement as the an|&s;wer,
which Heaven, having rejected the King, had
&s;ent to my &s;upplications&endq;.</P>
<P>A woman of Hertford&s;hire, illuminated by prophetical
vi&s;ions, de&s;ired admittance into the council of war, and
communicated to them a revelation, which a&s;&s;ured them,
that their mea&s;ures were con&s;ecrated from above, and ra|tified
by a heavenly &s;anction. This intelligence gave
them great comfort, and much confirmed them in their
pre&s;ent re&s;olutions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 360.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COLONEL Harri&s;on, the &s;on of a butcher, and the mo&s;t
furious enthu&s;ia&s;t of the army, was &s;ent with a &s;trong
party to conduct the King to London. At Wind&s;or,
Hamilton, who was there detained a pri&s;oner, was ad|mitted
into the King's pre&s;ence; and falling on his
knees, pa&s;&s;ionately exclaimed, <HI>My dear ma&s;ter! I have
indeed been &s;o to you,</HI> replied Charles, embracing him.
No farther intercour&s;e was allowed between them. The
King was in&s;tantly hurried away. Hamilton long fol|lowed
him with his eyes, all &s;uffu&s;ed in tears, and prog|no&s;ticated,
that, in this &s;hort &s;alutation, he had given
the la&s;t adieu to his &s;overeign and his friend.</P>
<P>CHARLES him&s;elf was a&s;&s;ured, that the period of his
life was now approaching; but notwith&s;tanding all the
preparations, which were making, and the intelligence,
which he received, he could not, even yet, believe, that

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="139" REF="197">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="140" REF="198">
his enemies really meant to conclude their violences by
a public trial and execution. A private a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination he
every moment looked for; and tho' Harri&s;on a&s;&s;ured
him, that his apprehen&s;ions were intirely groundle&s;s, it
was by that cata&s;trophe, &s;o frequent with dethroned
princes, that he expected to terminate his life. In ap|pearance,
as well as reality, the King was now de|throned.
All the exterior &s;ymbols of &s;overeignty were
withdrawn, and his attendants had orders to &s;erve him
without ceremony. At fir&s;t, he was &s;hocked with in|&s;tances
of rudene&s;s and familiarity, to which he had been
&s;o little accu&s;tomed. <HI>Nothing &s;o contemptible as a de&s;pi&s;ed
prince!</HI> was the reflection, which they &s;ugge&s;ted to him.
But he &s;oon reconciled his mind to this, as he had done
to his other calamities.</P>
<P>ALL the circum&s;tances of the trial were now adju&s;ted;
and the high court of ju&s;tice fully con&s;tituted. It con|&s;i&s;ted
of 133 per&s;ons, as named by the commons; but
there never met above 70: So difficult was it found, not|with&s;tanding
the blindne&s;s of prejudice, and the allurements
of intere&s;t, to engage men of any name or character in
that criminal mea&s;ure. Cromwel, Ireton, Harri&s;on, and
the chief officers of the army, mo&s;t of them of very
mean birth, were members, together with &s;ome of the
lower hou&s;e and &s;ome citizens of London. The twelve
judges were at fir&s;t appointed in the number: But as
they had affirmed, that it was contrary to all the ideas of
Engli&s;h law to try the King for trea&s;on, by who&s;e au|thority
all accu&s;ations for trea&s;on mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con|ducted;
their names, as well as tho&s;e of &s;ome peers,
were afterwards &s;truck out. Brad&s;haw, a lawyer, was
cho&s;en pre&s;ident. Coke was appointed &s;ollicitor for the
people of England. Dori&s;laus, Steele, and A&s;ke, were
named a&s;&s;i&s;tants. The court &s;at in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that, in calling over the court, when
the crier pronounced the name of Fairfax, which had
<PB N="141" REF="199">
been in&s;erted in the number, a voice came from one of
the &s;pectators, and cried, <HI>He has more wit than to be here.</HI>
When the charge was read again&s;t the King, <HI>In the name
of the people of England;</HI> the &s;ame voice exclaimed, <HI>Not a
tenth part of them.</HI> Axtel the officer, who guarded the
court, giving orders to fire into the box, whence the&s;e
in&s;olent &s;peeches came; it was di&s;covered, that Lady
Fairfax was there, and that it was &s;he who had had the
courage to utter them. She was a per&s;on of very noble
extraction, the daughter of Horace Lord Vere of Til|bury;
but being &s;educed by the violence of the times,
&s;he had long &s;econded her hu&s;band's zeal again&s;t the royal
cau&s;e, and was now, as well as he, &s;truck with abhor|rence
at the fatal and unexpected con&s;equence of all his
boa&s;ted victories.</P>
<P>THE pomp, the dignity, the ceremony of this tran|&s;action<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's trial.</NOTE>
corre&s;ponded to the greate&s;t conception, that is
&s;ugge&s;ted in the annals of human kind; the delegates of
a great people &s;itting in judgment upon their &s;upreme
magi&s;trate and trying him for his mi&s;government and
breach of tru&s;t. The &s;ollicitor, in name of the com|mons,
repre&s;ented, that Charles Stuart, being admitted
king of England, and <HI>entru&s;ted</HI> with a limited power;
yet neverthele&s;s, out of a wicked de&s;ign to erect an un|limited
and tyrannical government, had traiterou&s;ly and
maliciou&s;ly levied war again&s;t the pre&s;ent parliament, and
the people, whom they repre&s;ented, and was therefore
impeached as a tyrant, traitor, murderer, and a public
and implacable enemy to the commonwealth. After the
charge was fini&s;hed, the pre&s;ident directed his di&s;cour&s;e
to the King, and told him, that the court expected his
an&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' long detained a pri&s;oner, and now
produced as a criminal, &s;u&s;tained, by his magnanimous
courage, the maje&s;ty of a monarch. With great tem|per
<PB N="142" REF="200">
and dignity, he declined the authority of the court,
and refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit him&s;elf to their juri&s;diction. He
repre&s;ented, That, having been engaged in treaty with
his two hou&s;es of parliament, and having fini&s;hed almo&s;t
every article, he had expected to be brought to his ca|pital
in another manner, and ere this time, to have been
re&s;tored to his power, dignity, revenue, as well as to
his per&s;onal liberty: That he could not now perceive
any appearance of the upper hou&s;e, &s;o e&s;&s;ential a mem|ber
of the con&s;titution; and had learned, that even the
commons, who&s;e authority was pretended, were &s;ubdued
by lawle&s;s force, and were bereaved of their liberty:
That he him&s;elf was their NATIVE HEREDITARY KING;
nor was the whole authority of the &s;tate, tho' free and
united, intitled to try him, who derived his dignity from
the Supreme Maje&s;ty of Heaven: That, admitting tho&s;e
extravagant principles, which levelled all orders of men,
the court could plead no power, delegated by the people;
unle&s;s the con&s;ent of every individual, down to the
meane&s;t and mo&s;t ignorant pea&s;ant, had been previou&s;ly
a&s;ked and obtained: That he acknowledged, without
&s;cruple, that he had a <HI>tru&s;t,</HI> committed to him, and
one mo&s;t &s;acred and inviolable; he was entru&s;ted with
the liberties of his people, and would not now betray
them, by recognizing a power, founded on the mo&s;t atro|cious
violence and u&s;urpation: That having taken arms,
and frequently expo&s;ed his life, in defence of public li|berty,
of the con&s;titution, of the fundamental laws of
the kingdom, he was willing, in this la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
&s;cene, to $eal with his blood tho&s;e precious rights,
for which, tho' in vain, he had &s;o long contended: That
tho&s;e, who arrogated a title to &s;it as his judges, were
born his &s;ubjects, and born &s;ubjects to tho&s;e laws,
which determined, <HI>That the king can do no wrong:</HI> That
he was not reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;heltering him&s;elf
under that general maxim, which guards every Engli&s;h
<PB N="143" REF="201">
monarch, even the lea&s;t de&s;erving; but was able, by the
mo&s;t &s;atisfactory rea&s;ons, to ju&s;tify tho&s;e mea&s;ures, in
which he had been engaged: That, to the whole world,
and even to them, his pretended judges, he was de&s;irous,
if called upon in another manner, to prove the integrity
of his conduct, and a&s;&s;ert the ju&s;tice of tho&s;e defen&s;ive
arms, to which, unwillingly and unfortunately, he had
had recour&s;e: But that, in order to pre&s;erve an uniformity
of conduct, he muft, at pre&s;ent, forego the apology of
his innocence; le$t, by ratifying an authority, no better
founded than that of robbers and pyrates, he be ju&s;tly
branded as the betrayer, in&s;tead of being applauded as
the martyr, of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THE pre&s;ident, in order to &s;upport the maje&s;ty of the
people, and maintain the &s;uperiority of his court above
the pri&s;oner, &s;till inculcated, That he mu&s;t not decline
the authority of his judges; that they over-ruled his ob|jections;
that they were delegated by the people, the
only &s;ource of every lawful power; and that kings
them&s;elves acted but in tru&s;t from that community, which
had inve&s;ted this high court of ju&s;tice with its juri&s;diction.
Even according to tho&s;e principles, which, in his pre&s;ent
&s;ituation, he was perhaps obliged to adopt, his behaviour,
in general, will appear not a little har&s;h and barbarous;
but when we con&s;ider him as a &s;ubject, and one too of
no high character, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his unfortunate
&s;overeign, his &s;tyle will be e&s;teemed, to the la&s;t degree,
audacious and in&s;olent.</P>
<P>THREE times was Charles produced before the court,
and as often declined their juri&s;diction. On the fourth,
the judges having examined &s;ome witne&s;&s;es, by whom it
was proved, that the King had appeared in arms again&s;t
the forces commi&s;&s;ioned by the parliament, they pro|nounced
&s;entence again&s;t him. He &s;eemed very anxious,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of Jan.</NOTE>
at this time, to be admitted to a conference with the two
<PB N="144" REF="202">
hou&s;es; and it was &s;uppo&s;ed, that he intended to re&s;ign
the crown to his &s;on: But the court refu&s;ed compliance,
and con&s;idered that reque&s;t as nothing but a delay of
ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IT is confe&s;&s;ed, that the King's behaviour, during
this la&s;t period of his life, does great honour to his me|mory;
and that, in all appearances before his judges, he
never forgot his part, either as a prince or as a man. Firm
and intrepid, he maintained, in each reply, the utmo&s;t
per&s;pecuity and ju&s;tne&s;&s; both of thought and expre&s;&s;ion:
Mild and equable, he ro&s;e into no pa&s;&s;ion at that un|u&s;ual
authority, which was a&s;&s;umed over him. His &s;oul,
without effort or affectation, &s;eemed only to remain in
the &s;ituation &s;amiliar to it, and to look down with con|tempt
on all the efforts of human malice and iniquity.
The &s;oldiers, in&s;tigated by their &s;uperiors, were brought,
tho' with difficulty, to cry aloud for ju&s;tice: <HI>Poor &s;ouls!</HI>

they would do as much again&s;t their commanders</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ru&s;h, vol. viii. p, 1425.</NOTE>. Some of
them were permitted to go the utmo&s;t length of brutal in|&s;olence,
and to &s;pit in his face, as he was conveyed along
the pa&s;&s;age to the court. To excite a &s;entiment of piety,
was the only effect which this inhuman in&s;ult was able
to operate upon him.</P>
<P>THE people, tho' under the rod of lawle&s;s, unlimited
power, could not forbear, with the mo&s;t ardent prayers,
to pour forth their wi&s;hes for his pre&s;ervation; and, in
his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, they avowed <HI>him,</HI> by their generous
tears, for their monarch, whom, in their mi&s;guided fury,
they had before &s;o violently rejected. The King was
&s;oftened at this moving &s;cene, and expre&s;&s;ed his gratitude
for their dutiful affection. One &s;oldier too, &s;eized by
contagious &s;ympathy, demanded from heaven a ble&s;&s;ing
on oppre&s;&s;ed and fallen maje&s;ty: His officer, over-hear|ing
<PB N="145" REF="203">
his prayer, beat him to the ground in the King's pre|&s;ence.
<HI>The puni&s;hment, methinks, exceeds the offence:</HI> This
was the reflection, which Charles formed on that occa|&s;ion<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Warwick, p. 339.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the intention of trying the King was known
in foreign nations, &s;o enormous an action was exclaimed
again&s;t by the general voice of rea&s;on and humanity;
and all men, under whatever form of government they
were born, rejected this example, as the utmo&s;t effort of
undi&s;gui&s;ed u&s;urpation, and the mo&s;t heinous in&s;ult on
law and ju&s;tice. The French amba&s;&s;ador, by orders from
his court, interpo&s;ed on the King's behalf: The Dutch
employed their good offices: The Scots exclaimed and
prote&s;ted again&s;t this violence: The Queen, the Prince,
wrote pathetic letters to the parliament. All &s;ollicita|tions
were found fruitle&s;s with men who&s;e re&s;olutions
were fixed and irrevocable.</P>
<P>FOUR of Charles's friends, per&s;ons of the greate&s;t vir|tue
and dignity, Richmond, Hertford, Southampton,
Linde&s;ey, applied to the commons. They repre&s;ented,
That they were the King's coun&s;ellors, and had con|curred,
by their advice, with all tho&s;e mea&s;ure; which
were now imputed as crimes to their royal ma&s;ter: That,
in the eye of the law, and according to the dictates of
common rea&s;on, they alone were guilty, and were alone
expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure for every blameable action of the
prince: And that they now pre&s;ented them&s;elves, in or|der
to &s;ave, by their own puni&s;hment, that precious life,
which it became the commons them&s;elves, and every
&s;ubject, with the utmo&s;t hazard, to protect and defend<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Perinchef, p. 85. Lloyde, p. 319.</NOTE>.
Such a generous effort contributed to their honour; but
operated nothing towards the King's &s;afety.</P>
<P>THE people remained in that &s;ilence and a&s;toni&s;h|ment,
which all great pa&s;&s;ions, when they have not an
<PB N="146" REF="204">
opportunity of exerting them&s;elves, naturally produce in
the human mind. The &s;oldiers, being ince&s;&s;antly plied
with prayers, &s;ermons, and exhortations, were wrought
up to a degree of fury, and imagined, that, in the acts
of the mo&s;t extreme di&s;loyalty towards their prince, con|&s;i&s;ted
their highe&s;t merit in the eyes of Heaven<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet's Hi&s;tory of his own Times.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THREE days were allowed the King between his &s;en|tence
and his execution. This interval he pa&s;&s;ed with
great tranquillity chiefly in reading and devotion. All
his family, that remained in England, were allowed ac|ce&s;s
to him. It con&s;i&s;ted only of the Prince&s;s Elizabeth
and the Duke of Gloce&s;ter; for the Duke of York
had made his e&s;cape. Gloce&s;ter was little more than
an infant: The Prince&s;s, notwith&s;tanding her tender
years, &s;hewed a very advanced judgment; and the cala|mities
of her family had made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon
her. After many pious con&s;olations and advices, the
King gave her in charge to tell the Queen, That, during
the whole cour&s;e of his life, he had never once, even in
thought, failed in his fidelity towards her; and that his
conjugal tenderne&s;s and his life &s;hould have an equal
duration.</P>
<P>TO the young Duke too, he could not forbear giving
&s;ome advice, in order to &s;ea&s;on his mind with early prin|ciples
of loyalty and obedience towards his brother, who
was &s;o &s;oon to be his &s;overeign. Holding him on his
knee, he &s;aid, &startq;Now they will cut off thy father's
head.&endq; At the&s;e words, the child looked very &s;ted|fa&s;tly
upon him. &startq;Mark! child, what I &s;ay: They
will cut off my head! and perhaps make thee a king:
But mark what I &s;ay: Thou mu&s;t not be a king, as long
as thy brothers, Charles and James, are alive. They
will cut off thy brother's heads, when they can catch
them! And thy head too they will cut off at la&s;t!
<PB N="147" REF="205">
And therefore I charge thee do not be made a king
by them!&endq; The Duke, &s;ighing, replied, &startq;I will
be torn in pieces fir&s;t!&endq; So determined an an&s;wer,
from one of &s;uch tender years, filled the King's eyes
with tears of joy and admiration.</P>
<P>EVERY night, during this interval, the King &s;lept
&s;ound as u&s;ual; tho' the noi&s;e of workmen, employed
in framing the &s;caffold, and other preparations for his exe|cution,
continually re&s;ounded in his ears<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Clement Walker's hi&s;tory of independency.</NOTE>. The morn|ing
of the fatal day, he ro&s;e early; and calling Herbert,
one of his attendants, he bade him employ more than
u&s;ual care in dre&s;&s;ing him, and preparing him for &s;o
great and joyful a &s;olemnity. Bi&s;hop Juxon, a man en|dowed
with the &s;ame mild and &s;teddy virtues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of Jan.</NOTE> by which
the King him&s;elf was &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed, a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him in his devotions, and paid the la&s;t melancholy duties
to his friend and &s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE &s;treet before Whitehall was the place de&s;tined
for the execution: For it was intended,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And Execu|tion.</NOTE> by choo&s;ing that
very place, in &s;ight of his own palace, to di&s;play more
evidently the triumph of popular ju&s;tice over royal ma|je&s;ty.
When the King came upon the &s;caffold, he
found it &s;o &s;urrounded with &s;oldiers, that he could not
expect to be heard by any of the people: He addre&s;&s;ed,
therefore, his di&s;cour&s;e to the few per&s;ons who were
about him; particularly Colonel Tomlin&s;on, to who&s;e
care he had lately been committed, and upon whom, as
upon many others, his amiable deportment had operated
an intire conver&s;ion. He ju&s;tified his own innocence in
the late fatal wars, and ob&s;erved, that he had not taken
arms, till after the parliament had inli&s;ted forces; nor
had he any other object in his warlike operations, than
to pre&s;erve that authority intire, which his ance&s;tors had
tran&s;mitted to him. He threw not, however, the blame
<PB N="148" REF="206">
upon the parliament; but was more inclined to think
that ill in&s;truments had interpo&s;ed, and excited in them
fears and jealou&s;ies with regard to his intentions. Tho'
innocent towards his people, he acknowledged the equity
of his execution in the eyes of his Maker; and ob|&s;erved,
that an unju&s;t &s;entence which he had &s;uffered to
take effect, was now puni&s;hed by an unju&s;t &s;entence
upon him&s;elf. He forgave all his enemies, even the chief
in&s;truments of his death; but exhorted them and the
whole nation to return to the way of peace, by paying
obedience to their lawful &s;overeign, his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;|&s;or.
When he was preparing him&s;elf for the block, Bi|&s;hop
Juxon called to him: &startq;There is, Sir, but one
&s;tage more, which, tho' turbulent and trouble&s;ome, is
yet a very &s;hort one. Con&s;ider, it will &s;oon carry you
a great way; it will carry you from earth to heaven;
and there you &s;hall find, to your great joy, the prize,
to which you ha&s;ten, a crown of glory.&endq; I go,&endq; re|plied
the King, &startq;from a corruptible to an incorruptible
crown; where no di&s;turbance can have place.&endq; At
one blow was his head &s;evered from his body. A man
in a vizor performed the office of executioner: Another,
in a like di&s;gui&s;e, held up, to the &s;pectators, the head,
&s;treaming with blood, and cried aloud, <HI>This is the head of
a traitor!</HI></P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the grief, indignation, and
a&s;toni&s;hment, which took place, not only among the
&s;pectators, who were overwhelmed with a flood of &s;or|row,
but throughout the whole nation, &s;o &s;oon as the
report of this fatal execution was conveyed to them.
Never monarch, in the full triumph of &s;ucce&s;s and victo|ry,
was more dear to his people than his misfortunes and
magnanimity, his patience and piety, had rendered this
unhappy Prince. In proportion to their former delu&s;ions,
which had animated them again&s;t him, was the violence
<PB N="149" REF="207">
of their return to duty and affection; while each re|proached
him&s;elf, either with active di&s;loyalty towards
him, or with too indolent defence of his oppre&s;&s;ed cau&s;e.
On weaker minds, the effects of the&s;e complicated pa&s;|&s;ions
were prodigious. Women are &s;aid to have ca&s;t
forth the untimely fruit of their womb: Others fell into
convul&s;ions, or &s;unk into &s;uch a melancholy as attended
them to their grave: Nay &s;ome, unmindful of them|&s;elves,
as tho' they could not, or would not &s;urvive their
beloved prince, it is reported, &s;uddenly fell down dead.
The very pulpits were bedewed with un&s;uborned tears;
tho&s;e pulpits, which had formerly thundered out the mo&s;t
violent imprecations and anathemas again&s;t him. And
all men united in their dete&s;tation of tho&s;e hypocritical
parricides, who, by &s;anctified pretences, had &s;o long di&s;|gui&s;ed
their trea&s;ons, and in this la&s;t act of iniquity,
had thrown an indelible &s;tain upon the nation.</P>
<P>A fre&s;h in&s;tance of hypocri&s;y was di&s;played the very
day of the King's death. The generous Fairfax, not
contended with being ab&s;ent from the trial, had u&s;ed
all the intere&s;t, which he yet retained, to prevent the
execution of the fatal &s;entence; and had even employed
per&s;ua&s;ion with his own regiment, tho' none el&s;e &s;hould
follow him, to re&s;cue the King from his di&s;loyal mur|derers.
Cromwel and Ireton, informed of this inten|tion,
endeavoured to convince him, that the Lord had
rejected the King; and they exhorted him to &s;eek by
prayer &s;ome direction from Heaven on this important oc|ca&s;ion:
But they concealed from him, that they had al|ready
&s;igned the warrant for the execution. Harri&s;on
was the per&s;on appointed to join in prayer with the un|wary
general. By agreement, he prolonged his doleful
cant, till intelligence arrived, that the fatal blow was
&s;truck. He then ro&s;e from his knees, and in&s;i&s;ted with
Fairfax, that this event was a miraculous and providen|tial

an&s;wer, whch Heaven had &s;ent to their devout &s;up|plications<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Herbert, p. 135.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT being remarked, that the King, the moment be|fore
he &s;tretched out his neck to the executioner, had
&s;aid to Juxon, with a very earne&s;t accent, the &s;ingle
word, REMEMBER; great my&s;teries were &s;uppo&s;ed to be
concealed under that expre&s;&s;ion, and the generals vehe|mently
in&s;i&s;ted with the prelate, that he &s;hould inform
them of the King's meaning. Juxon told them, that the
King, having frequently charged him to inculcate on his
&s;on the forgivene&s;s of his murderers, had taken this op|portunity,
in the la&s;t moment of his life, when his com|mands,
he &s;uppo&s;ed, would be regarded as &s;acred and in|violable,
to re-iterate that de&s;ire: and that his mild &s;pi|rit
thus terminated its pre&s;ent cour&s;e, by an act of bene|volence
towards his greate&s;t enemies.</P>
<P>THE character of this Prince, as that of mo&s;t men,
if not of all men, was mixed; but his virtues predomi|nated
extremely above his vices, or, more properly &s;peak|ing,
his imperfections: For &s;carce any of his faults ro&s;e
to that pitch as to merit the appellation of vices. To
con&s;ider him in the mo&s;t favourable light, it may be af|firmed,
that his dignity was exempted from pride, his
humanity from weakne&s;s, his bravery from ra&s;hne&s;s, his
temperance from au&s;terity, his frugality from avarice:
All the&s;e virtues, in him, maintained their proper bounds,
and merited unre&s;erved prai&s;e. To &s;peak the mo&s;t har&s;hly
of him, we may affirm, that many of his good qualities
were attended with &s;ome latent frailty, which, tho'
&s;eemingly incon&s;iderable, was able, when &s;econded by
the extreme malevolence of his fortune, to di&s;appoint
them of all their influence: His beneficent di&s;po&s;ition
was clouded by a manner not very gracious; his virtue
was tinctured with &s;uper&s;tition; his good &s;en&s;e was di&s;|figured
<PB N="151" REF="211">
by a deference to per&s;ons of a capacity much in|ferior
to his own; and his moderate temper exempted
him not from ha&s;ty and precipitant re&s;olutions. He de|&s;erves
the epithet of a good, rather than of a great man;
and was more fitted to rule in a regular e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment,
than either to give way to the encroachments
of a popular a&s;&s;embly, or finally to &s;ubdue their preten|&s;ions.
He wanted &s;upplene&s;s and dexterity &s;ufficient for
the fir&s;t mea&s;ure: He was not endowed with the vigour
requi&s;ite for the &s;econd. Had he been born an ab&s;olute
prince, his humanity and good &s;en&s;e had rendered his
reign happy and his memory precious: Had the limita|tions
on prerogative been, in his time, quite fixed and
certain, his integrity had made him regard, as &s;acred,
the boundaries of the con&s;titution. Unhappily, his fate
threw him into a period, when the precedents of many
former reigns &s;avoured &s;trongly of arbitrary power, and
the genius of the people ran violently towards liberty.
And if his political prudence was not &s;ufficient to ex|tricate
him from &s;o perilous a &s;ituation, he may be ex|cu&s;ed;
&s;ince, even after the event, when it is commonly
ea&s;y to correct all errors, one is at a lo&s;s to determine
what conduct, in his circum&s;tances, could have main|tained
the authority of the crown, and pre&s;erved the
peace of the nation. Expo&s;ed, without revenue, with|out
arms, to the a&s;&s;ault of furious, implacable and bi|gotted
factions, it was never permitted him, but with
the mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences, to commit the &s;malle&s;t mi&s;|take;
a condition too rigorous to be impo&s;ed on the
greate&s;t human capacity.</P>
<P>SOME hi&s;torians have ra&s;hly que&s;tioned the good faith
of this Prince: But, for this reproach, the mo&s;t malig|nant
&s;crutiny of his conduct, which, in every circum|&s;tance,
is now thoroughly known, affords not any rea|&s;onable
foundation. On the contrary, if we con&s;ider
the extreme difficulties, to which he was &s;o frequently

reduced, and compare the &s;incerity of his profe&s;&s;ions and
declarations; we &s;hall avow, that probity and ho|nour
ought ju&s;tly to be numbered among his mo&s;t &s;hining
qualities. In every treaty, tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, which, he
thought, in con&s;cience, he could not maintain, he never
could, by any motive or per&s;ua&s;ion, be induced to make.
And though &s;ome violations of the petition of right may
be imputed to him; the&s;e are more to be a&s;cribed to the
nece&s;&s;ity of his &s;ituation, and to the lofty ideas of royal
prerogative, which he had imbibed, than to any failure
in the integrity of his principles<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The imputation of infincerity on Charles I. like many party-clamours, is very difficult to be removed; tho' it may not here be improper to &s;ay &s;ome|what with regard to it. I &s;hall fir&s;t remark, that this imputation &s;eems to be of a later growth than his own age; and that even his enemies, though they loaded him with many calumnies, did not in&s;i&s;t on this accu&s;ation. Lud|low, I think, is almo&s;t the only Parliamentarian, who imputes that vice to him; and how pa&s;&s;ionate a writer he is, mu&s;t be obvious to every one. Nei|ther Clarendon nor any other of the royali&s;ts ever ju&s;tify him from in&s;incerity; as not &s;uppo&s;ing that he had ever been accu&s;ed of it. In the &s;econd place, his deportment and character in common life was free from that vice: He was re&s;erved, di&s;tant, &s;tately; cold in his addre&s;s, plain in his di&s;cour&s;e, inflexi|ble in his principles; wide of the care&s;&s;ing, in&s;inuating manners of his &s;on; or the profe&s;&s;ing, talkative humour of his father. The imputation of in&s;in|cerity mu&s;t be grounded on &s;ome of his public actions, which we are there|fore in the third place to examine. The following are the only in&s;tances, which I find cited to confirm that accu&s;ation. (1.) His vouching Bucking|ham's narrative of the tran&s;actions in Spain. But it is evident that Charles him&s;elf was deceived: why otherwi&s;e did he quarrel with Spain? The fol|lowing is a pa&s;&s;age of a letter from lord Ken&s;ington, amba&s;&s;ador in France, to the duke of Buckingham, Cabbala, p. 318. &startq;But his highne&s;s (the Prince) had ob&s;erved as great a weakne&s;s and folly as that, in that after they (the Spaniards) had u&s;ed him &s;o ill, they would &s;uffer him to depart, which was one of the fir&s;t &s;peeches he uttered after he came into the &s;hip: But did he &s;ay &s;o? &s;aid the Queen (of France.) Yes, madam, I will a&s;|&s;ure you, quoth I, from the witne&s;s of mine own ears. She &s;miled and replied, Indeed I heard he was u&s;ed ill. So he was, an&s;wered I, but not in his entertainment; for that was as &s;plendid as that country could af|ford it; but in their frivolous delays, and in the unrea&s;onable conditions which they propounded and pre&s;&s;ed, upon the advantage they had of his princely per&s;on.&endq; (2.) Bi&s;hop Burnet, in his Hi&s;tory of the Hou&s;e of Hamilton, p. 154. has pre&s;erved a letter of the King's to the Scots bi&s;hops, in which he de&s;ires them not to be pre&s;ent at the parliament, where they would be forced to ratify the abolition of their own order: &startq;For,&endq; adds the King, &startq;we do hereby a&s;&s;ure you, that it &s;hall be &s;till one of our chie&s;e&s;t &s;tu|dies how to rectify and e&s;tabli&s;h the government of that church aright, and to repair your lo&s;&s;es, which we de&s;ired you to be mo&s;t confident of.&endq; And in another place, &startq;You may re&s;t &s;ecure, that though perhaps we may give way for the pre&s;ent to that which will be prejudicial both to the church and our own government; yet we &s;hall not leave thinking in time how to remedy both.&endq; But does the King &s;ay, that he will arbitrarily revoke his conce&s;&s;ions? Does not candor require us rather to &s;uppo&s;e, that he hoped his authority would &s;o far recover as to enable him to obtain the national con&s;ent to re-e&s;tabli&s;h epi&s;copacy, which he believed &s;o material a part of religion as well as of government? It is not ea&s;y indeed to think how he could expect to effectuate this purpo&s;e in any other way than his father had taken, that is, by con&s;ent of parliament. (3.) There is a pa&s;&s;age in lord Clarendon, where it is &s;aid, that the King a&s;&s;ented the more ea&s;ily to the bill, which excluded the bi&s;hops from the Hou&s;e of Peers; becau&s;e he thought, that that law, being enacted by force, could not be valid. But the King certainly rea&s;oned right in that conclu&s;ion. Three fourths of the Hou&s;e of Peers were at that time bani&s;hed by the violence of the populace: Twelve bi&s;hops were unju&s;tly thrown into the Tower by the Commons: Great numbers of the Commons them&s;elves were kept away by fear or violence: The King him&s;elf was forced to leave London. If all this be not force, there is no &s;uch thing. But this &s;cruple of the King's affects only the bi&s;hops' bill, and that again&s;t pre&s;&s;ing. The other con&s;titutional laws had pa&s;&s;ed without the lea&s;t appearance of vio|lence, as did indeed all the bills pa&s;&s;ed during the fir&s;t year, except Strafford's attainder, which could not be recalled. The parliament, therefore, even if they had known the King's &s;entiments in this particular, could have no ju&s;t foundation of jealou&s;y. (4.) The King's letter intercepted at Na&s;eby, has been the &s;ource of much clamour. We have &s;poke of it already, chap. lviii. Perhaps, it had been better had the King avoided that refinement; yet no|thing is more u&s;ual in all public tran&s;actions. After the death of Charles II. of Spain, King William's amba&s;&s;adors gave the duke of Anjou the title of King of Spain: Yet at that very time King William was &s;ecretly forming alliances to de|throne him: And &s;oon after he refu&s;ed him that title, and in&s;i&s;ted (as he had rea|&s;on) that he had not acknowledged his right. Yet King William ju&s;tly pa&s;&s;es for a very &s;incere Prince; and this tran&s;action is not regarded as any objection to his character. In all the negotiations at the peace of Ry&s;wic, the French am|ba&s;&s;adors always addre&s;&s;ed King William as King of England; yet it was made an expre&s;s article of the treaty, that the French King &s;hould acknow|lege him as &s;uch. Such a palpable difference is there between giving a title to a Prince, and po&s;itively recognizing his right to it. I may add, that Charles when he in&s;erted his prote&s;tation in the council-books before his council, &s;urely thought he had rea&s;on to ju&s;tify his counduct. There were too many men of honour in that company to avow a palpable cheat: To which we may &s;ubjoin, that, if men were as much di&s;po&s;ed to judge of this Prince's actions with candor as &s;everity, this precaution of entering a prote&s;t in his council-books might rather pa&s;s for a proof of &s;crupulous honour; left he &s;hould afterwards be reproached with breach of his word, when he &s;hould think proper again to declare the a&s;&s;embly at We&s;tmin&s;ter no parliament. (5.) The denying his commi&s;&s;ion to Glamorgan is another in&s;tance which has been cited. This matter has been already treated chap. lviii. That tran&s;action was entirely innocent. Even if the King had given a commi&s;&s;ion to Glamorgan to con|clude that treaty, and had ratified it, will any rea&s;onable man, in our age, think it &s;trange, that, in order to &s;ave his own life, his crown, his family, his friends, and his party, he &s;hould make a treaty with papifts, and grant them very large conce&s;&s;ions for their religion. (6.) There is another of the King's intercepted letters to the Queen commonly mentioned; where, it is pretended, he talked of rai&s;ing and then de&s;troying Cromwel: But that &s;tory &s;tands on no manner of foundation, as we have ob&s;erved in chap. lix. In a word, the par|liament, after the commencement of their violences, and &s;till more, after be|ginning the civil war, had rea&s;on for their &s;cruples and jealou&s;ies, founded on the very nature of their &s;ituation, and on the general propen&s;ity of the hu|man mind; not on any fault of the King's character; who was candid, &s;in|cere, upright; as much almo&s;t as any man, whom we meet with in hi&s;tory.</NOTE>&punc;</P>

THIS Prince was of a comely pre&s;ence; of a &s;weet,

and well complexioned; his body &s;trong, healthy, and
ju&s;tly proportioned; and being of a middle &s;tature, he

all the exterior, as well as many of the e&s;&s;ential
qualities, which form an accompli&s;hed prince.</P>
<P>THE tragical death of Charles begot a que&s;tion, whe|ther
the people, in any ca&s;e, were intitled to judge and to
puni&s;h their &s;overeign; and mo&s;t men, regarding chiefly
the atrocious u&s;urpation of the pretended judges, and the
merit of the virtuous prince who &s;uffered, were inclined
&s;trongly to condemn the republican principles, as highly
&s;editious and extravagant: But there &s;till were a few,
<PB N="155" REF="217">
who, ab&s;tracting from the particular circum&s;tances of
this ca&s;e, were able to con&s;ider the que&s;tion in general,
and were inclined to moderate, not contradict, the pre|vailing
&s;entiment. Such might have been their rea&s;on|ing.
If ever, on any occa&s;ion, it were laudable to con|ceal
truth from the populace; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that
the doctrine of re&s;i&s;tance affords &s;uch an example; and
that all &s;peculative rea&s;oners ought to ob&s;erve, with re|gard
to this principle, the &s;ame cautious &s;ilence, which
the laws, in every &s;pecies of government, have ever pre|&s;cribed
to them&s;elves. Government is in&s;tituted, in or|der
to re&s;train the fury and inju&s;tice of the people; and
being always founded on opinion, not on force, it is
dangerous to weaken, by the&s;e &s;peculations, the reve|rence,
which the multitude owe to authority, and to
in&s;truct them beforehand, that the ca&s;e can ever happen,
when they may be freed from their duty of allegiance.
Or &s;hould it be found impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;train the licence
of human di&s;qui&s;itions, it mu&s;t be acknowleged, that
the doctrine of obedience ought alone to be <HI>inculcated,</HI>
and that the exceptions, which are very rare, ought
&s;eldom or never to be mentioned in popular rea&s;onings
and di&s;cour&s;es. Nor is there any danger, that mankind,
by this prudent re&s;erve, &s;hould univer&s;ally degenerate in|to
a &s;tate of abject &s;ervitude. When the exception re|ally
occurs, even though it be not previou&s;ly expected
and de&s;canted on, it mu&s;t, from its very nature, be &s;o
obvious and undi&s;puted, as to remove all doubt, and
overpower the re&s;traint, however great, impo&s;ed by
teaching the general doctrine of obedience. But between
re&s;i&s;ting a prince and dethroning him, there is a very
wide interval; and the abu&s;es of power, which can war|rant
the latter violence, are much greater and more enor|mous,
than tho&s;e which will ju&s;tify the former. Hi&s;tory,
however, &s;upplies us with examples even of this kind;
and the reality of the &s;uppo&s;ition, though, for the fu|ture,
<PB N="156" REF="218">
it ought ever to be little looked for, mu&s;t, by all
candid inquirers, be acknowledged in the pa&s;t. But be|tween
dethroning a prince and puni&s;hing him, there is
another very wide interval; and it were not &s;trange, if
even men of the mo&s;t enlarged thought &s;hould que&s;tion,
whether human nature could ever, in any monarch,
reach that height of depravity, as to warrant, in revolt|ed
&s;ubjects, this la&s;t act of extraordinary juri&s;diction:
That illu&s;ion, if it be an illu&s;ion, which teaches us to
pay a &s;acred regard to the per&s;ons of princes, is &s;o &s;alu|tary,
that to di&s;&s;ipate it by the formal trial and puni&s;h|ment
of a &s;overeign, will have more pernicious effects
upon the people, than the example of ju&s;tice can be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have a beneficial influence upon princes, by
checking their career of tyranny. 'Tis dangerous al&s;o,
by the&s;e examples, to reduce princes to de&s;pair, or
bring matters to &s;uch extremities again&s;t per&s;ons endow|ed
with great power, as to leave them no re&s;ource, but
in the mo&s;t violent and mo&s;t &s;anguinary councils. This
general po&s;ition being e&s;tabli&s;hed, it mu&s;t, however, be
ob&s;erved, that no reader, almo&s;t of any party or prin|ciple,
was ever &s;hocked, when he read, in antient hi&s;|tory,
that the Roman &s;enate voted Nero, their ab&s;olute
&s;overeign, to be a public enemy, and, even without
trial, condemned him to the &s;evere&s;t and mo&s;t ignomini|ous
puni&s;hment; &s;uch a puni&s;hment, as the meane&s;t
Roman citizen was, by the laws, exempted from. The
crimes of that bloody tyrant are &s;o enormous, that they
break through all rules; and extort a confe&s;&s;ion, that
&s;uch a dethroned prince is no longer &s;uperior to his peo|ple,
and can no longer plead, in his own defence, laws,
which were e&s;tabli&s;hed for conducting the ordinary
cour&s;e of admini&s;tration. But when we pa&s;s from the
ca&s;e of Nero to that of Charles, the great di&s;proportion,
or rather total contrariety of characters, immediately
&s;trikes us; and we &s;tand a&s;toni&s;hed, that, among a ci|vilized
<PB N="157" REF="219">
people, &s;o much virtue could ever meet with &s;o fa|tal
a cata&s;trophe. Hi&s;tory, the great mi&s;tre&s;s of wi&s;dom,
furni&s;hes examples of all kinds; and every prudential,
as well as moral precept, may be authorized by tho&s;e
events, which her enlarged mirror is able to pre&s;ent to
us. From the memorable revolutions, which pa&s;&s;ed in
England during this period, we may naturally deduce
the &s;ame u&s;eful le&s;&s;on, which Charles him&s;elf, in his
latter years, inferred; that it is very dangerous for
princes to a&s;&s;ume more authority, than the laws have
allowed them. But, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e
events furni&s;h us with another in&s;truction, no le&s;s natu|ral,
and no le&s;s u&s;eful, concerning the madne&s;s of the
people, the furies of fanatici&s;m, and the danger of mer|cenary armies.</P>
<P>IN order to clo&s;e this part of Briti&s;h hi&s;tory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Feb.</NOTE> it is al&s;o
nece&s;&s;ary to relate the di&s;&s;olution of the monarchy in
England: That event &s;oon followed upon the death of
the monarch. When the $span$ on the day, ap|pointed
in their adjournment, they entered upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and &s;ent down &s;ome votes to the commons, of
which the latter deigned not to take the lea&s;t notice. In
a few days, the lower hou&s;e pa&s;&s;ed a vote, that they
&s;hould make no more addre&s;&s;es to the hou&s;e of peers, nor
receive any more from them; and that that hou&s;e was
u&s;ele&s;s and dangerous, and was therefore to be aboli&s;h|ed.
A like vote pa&s;&s;ed with regard to the monarchy;
and 'tis remarkable, that Martin, a zealous republican,
in the debate on this que&s;tion, confe&s;&s;ed, that, if they
de&s;ired a king, the la&s;t was as proper as any gentleman
in England<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Walker's hi&s;tory of independency, part 2.</NOTE>. The commons formed a new great &s;eal,

was executed on a &s;caffold, erected before We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.
Lord Capel underwent the &s;ame fate&punc; Both the&s;e

<P>IT may be expected that we &s;hould here make mention
of the <HI>Icon Ba&s;ilik&eacute;,</HI> a work publi&s;hed in the King's name
a few days after his execution. It &s;eems almo&s;t impo&s;|&s;ible,

thing which will &s;atisfy the zealots of both parties: But
with regard to the genuinene&s;s of that production, it is
not ea&s;y for an hi&s;torian to &s;ix any opinion, which will
be intirely to his own &s;atisfaction. The proofs brought
to evince that this work is or is not the King's, are &s;o
convincing, that, if an impartial reader peru&s;es any one &s;ide
apart<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">See on the one hand, Toland's Amyntor, and on the other, Wag&s;ta&s;&s;e's Vindication of the royal martyr, 3d edition, with Young's addition.

&s;ome time at a lo&s;s to fix any determination. Should an
ab&s;olute &s;u&s;pence of judgment be found difficult or di&s;|agreeable
in &s;o intere&s;ting a que&s;tion, I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
that I much incline to give the preference to the argu|ments
of the royali&s;ts. The te&s;timonies, which prove
that performance to be the King's, are more numerous,
certain, and direct, than tho&s;e on the other &s;ide. This
is the ca&s;e, even if we con&s;ider the external evidence:
But when we weigh the internal, derived from the &s;tyle
and compo&s;ition, there is no manner of compari&s;on.
The&s;e meditations re&s;emble in elegance, purity, neat|ne&s;s,
and &s;implicity, the genius of tho&s;e performances,
which we know with certainty to have flowed from the
royal pen: But are &s;o unlike the bomba&s;t, perplexed,
rhetorical, and corrupt &s;tyle of Dr. Gauden, to whom
they are a&s;cribed, that no human te&s;timony &s;eems &s;uffi|cient
to convince us, that he was the author. Yet all
the evidences, which would rob the King of that hon|our,
tend to prove, that Dr. Gauden had the merit of
writing &s;o fine a performance, and the infamy of im|po&s;ing
it on the world for the King's.</P>
<P>IT is not ea&s;y to conceive the general compa&s;&s;ion ex|cited
towards the King, by the publi&s;hing, at &s;o critical
a juncture, a work &s;o full of piety, meekne&s;s, and hu|manity.
Many have not &s;crupled to a&s;cribe to that
book the &s;ub&s;equent re&s;toration of the royal family.

great intere&s;t taken in it by the nation, as the &s;uppo&s;ed

<P>THE confu&s;ion which over&s;pread England after the
murder of Charles the Fir&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LX.</NOTE> proceeded as well
from the &s;pirit of refinement and innovation, which
agitated the ruling party,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eng|</NOTE> as from the di&s;&s;olution of all
that authority, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, by which
the nation had ever been accu&s;tomed to be governed.
Every man had framed the model of a republic; and,
however new it was, or fanta&s;tical, he was eager of re|commending
it to his fellow citizens, or even of im|po&s;ing
it by force upon them. Every man had adju&s;ted
a &s;y&s;tem of religion, which, being derived from no tradi|tional
authority, was peculiar to him&s;elf; and being
founded on &s;uppo&s;ed in&s;piration, not on any principles
of human rea&s;oning, had no means, be&s;ides cant and
low rhetoric, by which it could recommend it&s;elf to
others. The Levellers in&s;i&s;ted on an equal di&s;tribution
of property and power, and di&s;claimed all dependance
and &s;ubordination. The Millenarians or Fifth-Monar|chy-men
required, that government it&s;elf &s;hould be
aboli&s;hed, and all human powers be laid in the du&s;t, in
order to pave the way for the dominion of Chri&s;t, who&s;e
<PB N="162" REF="224">
&s;econd coming on earth they &s;uddenly expected. The
Antinomians even in&s;i&s;ted, that the obligations of mo|rality
and natural law were &s;u&s;pended, and that the elect,
guided by an internal principle, more perfect and divine,
were &s;uperior to the <HI>beggarly elements</HI> of ju&s;tice and humanity.
A con&s;iderable party declaimed again&s;t tythes and a hireling
prie&s;thood, and were re&s;olved that the magi&s;trate &s;hould
not &s;upport by power or revenue any eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.
Another party inveighed again&s;t the law
and its profe&s;&s;ors; and on pretence of rendering more
&s;imple the di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, were de&s;irous of abo|li&s;hing
the whole &s;y&s;tem of Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence, which
&s;eemed interwoven with monarchical government. Even
tho&s;e among the republicans, who adopted not &s;uch ex|travagancies,
were &s;o intoxicated with their faintly cha|racter,
that they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of peculiar
privileges; and all profe&s;&s;ions, oaths, laws, and engage|ments
had, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t their influence over
them. The bands of &s;ociety were every where loo&s;ened;
and the irregular pa&s;&s;ions of men were encouraged by
&s;peculative principles, &s;till more un&s;ocial and irregular.</P>
<P>THE Royali&s;ts, con&s;i&s;ting of the nobles and more con|&s;iderable
gentry, being degraded from their authority
and plundered of their property, were inflamed with the
highe&s;t re&s;entment and indignation again&s;t tho&s;e ignoble
adver&s;aries, who had reduced them to &s;ubjection. The
pre&s;byterians, who&s;e credit had fir&s;t &s;upported the arms
of the parliament, were enraged to find, that, by the
treachery or &s;uperior cunning of their, a&s;&s;ociates, the
fruits of all their &s;ucce&s;sful labours were ravi&s;hed from
them. The former party, from inclination and prin|ciple,
zealou&s;ly attached them&s;elves to the &s;on of their
unfortunate Monarch, who&s;e memory they re&s;pected,
and who&s;e tragical death they deplored. The latter ca&s;t
their eye towards the &s;ame object; but they had &s;till
many prejudices to overcome, many fears and jealou&s;ies
<PB N="163" REF="225">
to be allayed, ere they could cordially entertain thoughts
of re&s;toring that family, whom they had &s;o grievou&s;ly
offended, and who&s;e principles they regarded with &s;uch
violent abhorrence.</P>
<P>THE only &s;olid &s;upport of the republican independent
faction, which, tho' it formed &s;o &s;mall a part of the na|tion,
had violently u&s;urped the government of the whole,
was a numerous army of about fifty thou&s;and men. But
this army, formidable from its di&s;cipline and courage,
as well as its numbers, was actuated by a &s;pirit, that
rendered it extremely dangerous to the a&s;&s;embly, which
had a&s;&s;umed the command over it. Accu&s;tomed to in|dulge
every chimera in politics, every frenzy in religion,
the &s;oldiers knew little of the &s;ubordination of citizens,
and had only learned, from apparent nece&s;&s;ity, &s;ome
maxims of military obedience. And while they &s;till
maintained, that all tho&s;e enormous violations of law
and equity, of which they had been guilty, were ju&s;ti|fied
by the &s;ucce&s;s, with which providence had ble&s;&s;ed
them; they were ready to break out into any new di&s;or|der,
wherever they had the pro&s;pect of a like &s;anction
and authority.</P>
<P>WHAT alone gave &s;ome poize and &s;tability to all the&s;e
un&s;ettled humours, was the great influence, both civil
and military, acquired by Oliver Cromwel. This man,
&s;uited to the age in which he lived, and to that alone,
was equally qualified to gain the affection and confidence
of men, by what was mean, vulgar, and ridiculous in
his character; as to command their obedience by what
was great, daring, and enterprizing. Familiar even to
buffoonery with the meane&s;t centinel, he never lo&s;t his
authority: Tran&s;ported to a degree of madne&s;s with re|ligious
exta&s;ies, he never forgot the political purpo&s;es,
to which they might &s;erve. Hating monarchy, while a
&s;ubject; de&s;pi&s;ing liberty, while a citizen; tho' he re|tained
<PB N="164" REF="226">
for a time all orders of men under a &s;eeming obe|dience
to the parliament; he was &s;ecretly paving the
way, by artifice and courage, to his own unlimited au|thority.</P>
<P>THE parliament, for &s;o we mu&s;t henceforth call a
&s;mall and incon&s;iderable part of the hou&s;e of commons,
having murdered their Sovereign with &s;o many appear|ing
circum&s;tances of &s;olemnity and ju&s;tice, and &s;o much
real violence and even fury, began to a&s;&s;ume more the
air of a civil, legal power, and to enlarge a little the
narrow bottom, upon which they &s;tood. A few of the
excluded and ab&s;ent members, &s;uch as were liable to
lea&s;t exception, were admitted; but on condition, that
they &s;hould &s;ign an approbation of whatever had been
done in their ab&s;ence with regard to the King's trial:
And &s;ome of them were willing to acquire a &s;hare of
power on &s;uch terms: The greate&s;t part di&s;dained to
lend their authority to &s;uch apparent u&s;urpations. They
i&s;&s;ued &s;ome writs for new elections, in places where they
hoped to have intere&s;t enough to bring in their own
friends and dependants. They named a council of &s;tate
to the number of thirty eight, to whom all addre&s;&s;es

<PB N="165" REF="227">
from whom, they acknowledged, they had entirely
derived it.</P>
<P>THE Commonwealth found every thing in England
compo&s;ed into a &s;eeming tranquillity by the terror of
their arms. Foreign powers, occupied in wars among
them&s;elves, had no leizure nor inclination to interpo&s;e
in the dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions of this i&s;land. The young
king, poor and neglected, living &s;ometimes in Holland,
&s;ometimes in France, &s;ometimes in Jer&s;ey, comforted
him&s;elf, amid&s;t his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, with the hopes of
better fortune. The &s;ituation alone of Scotland and
Ireland gave any immediate inquietude to the new Re|public.</P>
<P>AFTER the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive defeats of Montro&s;e and Hamil|ton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Scotland.</NOTE>
and the ruin of their parties, the whole authority
in Scotland fell into the hands of Argyle and the rigid
churchmen, that party which was mo&s;t aver&s;e to the in|tere&s;ts
of the royal family. Their enmity, however,
again&s;t the independents, who had prevented the long
wi&s;hed for &s;ettlement of pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline in Eng|land,
carried them to embrace oppo&s;ite maxims in their po|litical
conduct. Tho' invited by the Engli&s;h parliament
to model their government into a republican form, they
re&s;olved still to adhere to monarchy, which had ever pre|vailed
in their country, and which, by the expre&s;s terms
of their Covenant, they were obliged to defend. They
con&s;idered be&s;ides, that as the property of the kingdom
lay chiefly in the hands of great families, it would be
difficult to e&s;tabli&s;h a Commonwealth, or without &s;ome
chief magi&s;trate, inve&s;ted with royal authority, to pre|serve
peace or ju&s;tice in the community. The execution
therefore, of the king, again&s;t which they had always
prote&s;ted, having occa&s;ioned a vacancy of the
throne, they immediately proclaimed his &s;on and &s;ucce&s;|&s;or,
Charles the &s;econd; but upon condition &startq;of his
<PB N="166" REF="228">
good behaviour and &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the Covenant,
and his entertaining no other per&s;ons about him but
&s;uch as were godly men and faithful to that obliga|tion.&endq;
The&s;e unu&s;ual clau&s;es, in&s;erted in the very
fir&s;t acknowledgement of their Prince, &s;ufficiently &s;hewed
their intention of limiting extremely his authority. And
the Engli&s;h Commonwealth, having no pretence to in|terpo&s;e
in the affairs of that kingdom, allowed the Scots,
for the pre&s;ent, to take their own mea&s;ures in &s;ettling
their government.</P>
<P>THE dominion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ireland.</NOTE> which England claimed over Ireland,
demanded more immediately their efforts for &s;ubouing
that country. In order to convey a ju&s;t notion of Iri&s;h
affairs, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to look backwards &s;ome years,
and to relate briefly tho&s;e tran&s;actions, which had pa&s;t
during the memorable revolutions in England. When
the late King agreed to that ce&s;&s;ation of arms with the
Popi&s;h rebels<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1643.</NOTE>, which was become &s;o requi&s;ite, as well
for the &s;ecurity of the Iri&s;h Prote&s;tants as for promoting
his intere&s;ts in England, the Parliament, in order to
blacken his conduct, reproached him with favoring that
odious rebellion, and exclaimed loudly again&s;t the terms
of the ce&s;&s;ation. They even went &s;o far as to declare
it entirely null and invalid, becau&s;e fini&s;hed without
their con&s;ent.; and to this declaration the Scots in Ul&s;ter,
and the Earl of Inchiquin, a nobleman of great autho|rity
in Mun&s;ter, profe&s;&s;ed to adhere. By their means,
the war was &s;till kept alive; but as the dangerous di&s;|tractions
in England hindered the parliament from &s;end|ing
any con&s;iderable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to their allies in Ireland,
Inchiquin entered into an accommodation with Ormond,
whom the King had created Lord-Lieutenant of that
kingdom. This latter nobleman, being a native of Ire|land,
and a per&s;on endowed with great prudence and
virtue, formed a &s;cheme for compo&s;ing the di&s;orders of
<PB N="167" REF="229">
his country, and for engaging the rebel Iri&s;h to &s;upport
the cau&s;e of his royal ma&s;ter. There were many cir|cum&s;tances
which &s;trongly invited the Iri&s;h to embrace
the King's party. The maxims of that Prince had al|ways
led him to give a rea&s;onable indulgence to the ca|tholics
throughout all his dominions; and one principal
ground of that enmity, which the puritans profe&s;&s;ed
again&s;t him, was this tacit toleration. The parliament,
even when unprovoked, had ever menaced the papi&s;ts with
the mo&s;t rigid re&s;traint, if not a total extirpation; and
immediately after the commencement of the Iri&s;h rebel|lion,
they put to &s;ale all the e&s;tates of the rebels, and had
engaged the public faith for transferring them to the ad|venturers,
who had already advanced money upon that
&s;ecurity. The &s;ucce&s;s, therefore, which the arms of
the parliament met with at Na&s;eby, &s;truck a ju&s;t terror
into the Iri&s;h; and engaged the council of Kilkenny,
compo&s;ed of deputies from all the catholic counties and
cities, to conclude a peace with the Marque&s;s of Or|mond<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1646.</NOTE>.
They profe&s;&s;ed to return to their duty and al|legiance,
engaged to furni&s;h ten thou&s;and men for the
&s;upport of the King's authority in England, and were
contented with &s;tipulating, in return, indemnity for
their rebellion and toleration of their religion.</P>
<P>ORMOND not doubting but a peace, &s;o advantageous
and even nece&s;&s;ary to the Iri&s;h, would be &s;trictly ob|&s;erved,
advanced with a &s;mall body of troops to Kil|kenny,
in order to concert mea&s;ures for common de|fence
with his new allies. The pope had &s;ent over to
Ireland a nuncio, Rinuccini, an Italian; and this man,
who&s;e commi&s;&s;ion empowered him to direct the &s;piritual
concerns of the Iri&s;h, was emboldened, by their igno|rance
and bigotry, to a&s;&s;ume the chief authority in the
civil government. Fore&s;eeing that a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
<PB N="168" REF="230">
to the Lord-Lieutenant would put an end to his own in|fluence,
he con&s;pired with Owen Oneal, who com|manded
the native Iri&s;h in Ul&s;ter, and who bore a great
jealou&s;y to Pre&s;ton, the general chiefly tru&s;ted by the
council of Kilkenny. By concert, the&s;e two malcon|tents
&s;ecretly drew forces together, and were ready to
fall on Ormond, who remained in &s;ecurity, tru&s;ting to
the pacification &s;o lately concluded with the rebels. He
received intelligence of their treachery, made his retreat
with great celerity and conduct, and &s;heltered his &s;mall
army in Dublin and the other fortified towns, which
&s;till remained in the hands of the Prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>THE nuncio, full of arrogance, levity, and ambition,
was not contented with this violation of treaty. He
&s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly of the clergy at Waterford, and
engaged them to declare again&s;t that pacification, which
the civil council had concluded with their lawful &s;ove|reign.
He even thundered out a &s;entence of excommu|nication
again&s;t all tho&s;e who &s;hould adhere to a peace,
&s;o prejudicial, as he pretended, to the catholic religion;
and the deluded Iri&s;h, terrified with his &s;piritual menaces,
ranged them&s;elves every where on his &s;ide, and &s;ub|mitted
to his authority. Without &s;cruple, he carried on
war again&s;t the Lord Lieutenant, and threatened with a
&s;iege the prote&s;tant garri&s;ons, which were, all of them,
very ill provided for defence.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the unfortunate King was nece&s;&s;itated
to take &s;helter in the Scots army; and being there re|duced
to clo&s;e confinement, and &s;ecluded from all com|merce
with his friends, de&s;paired, that his authority, o$
even his liberty, would ever be re&s;tored to him. He
&s;ent orders to Ormond, if he could not defend him&s;elf
rather to &s;ubmit to the Engli&s;h than the Iri&s;h rebels&punc;
and accordingly the Lord Lieutenant, being reduced to
the la&s;t extremity, delivered up Dublin, Tredah, Dun|dalk,
<PB N="169" REF="231">
and other garri&s;ons to colonel Michael Jones, who
took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them in the name of the Engli&s;h par|liament.
Ormond him&s;elf went over to England, was
admitted to the King's pre&s;ence, received a grateful ac|knowlegement
for his pa&s;t &s;ervices, and during &s;ome
time lived in tranquillity near London. But being ba|ni&s;hed,
with the other royali&s;ts, to a di&s;tance from that
city, and &s;eeing every event turn out unfortunately for
his royal ma&s;ter, and threaten him with a cata&s;trophe
&s;till more direful, he thought proper to retire into France,
where he joined the Queen and the Prince of Wales.</P>
<P>IN Ireland, during the&s;e tran&s;actions, the authority of
the nuncio prevailed without control among all the ca|tholics;
and that prelate, by his indi&s;cretion and in&s;o|lence,
&s;oon made them repent of the power, with which
they had entru&s;ted him. Prudent men likewi&s;e were &s;en|&s;ible
of the total de&s;truction, which was hanging over
the nation from the Engli&s;h parliament, and &s;aw no re|&s;ource
nor &s;afety but in giving &s;upport to the declining
authority of the King. The Earl of Clanricarde, a
nobleman of very antient family, a per&s;on too of merit,
who had ever pre&s;erved his loyalty, was &s;en&s;ible of the
ruin which threatened his countrymen, and was re&s;olved,
if po&s;&s;ible, to prevent it. He &s;ecretly formed a combi|nation
among the catholics; he entered into a corre|&s;pondence
with Inchiquin, who pre&s;erved great autho|rity
over the prote&s;tants in Mun&s;ter; he attacked the
nuncio, whom he chaced out of the i&s;land; and he &s;ent
to Paris a deputation, inviting the Lord Lieutenant to
return and take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his government.</P>
<P>ORMOND on his arrival in Ireland found the king|dom
divided into many factions, among whom either
open war or &s;ecret enmity prevailed. The authority of
the Engli&s;h parliament was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Dublin, and
the other towns, which he him&s;elf had delivered into
<PB N="170" REF="232">
their hands. Oneale maintained his credit in Ul&s;ter;
and having entered into a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with the
parliamentary generals, was more intent on &s;chemes for
his own per&s;onal &s;afety than anxious for the pre&s;ervation
of his country or religion. The other Iri&s;h, divided be|tween
their clergy, who were aver&s;e to Ormond, and
their nobility, who were attached to him, were very un|certain
in their motions and feeble in their mea&s;ures.
The Scots in the north, enraged, as well as their other
countrymen, again&s;t the u&s;urpations of the &s;ectarian
army, pro$e&s;&s;ed their adherence to the King; but were
&s;till hindered by many prejudices from entering into a
cordial union with his Lieutenant. All the&s;e di&s;tracted
councils and contrary humors checked the progre&s;s of
Ormond, and enabled the parliamentary forces in Ireland
to maintain their ground again&s;t him. The Engli&s;h
army, while employed in &s;ubduing the revolted royali&s;ts,
in reducing the parliament to &s;ubjection, in the trial,
condemnation, and execution of their &s;overeign, totally
neglected the &s;upply of Ireland, and allowed Jones and
the forces in Dublin to remain in the utmo&s;t weakne&s;s
and nece&s;&s;ity. But the Lord Lieutenant, having at la&s;t,
with much difficulty, a&s;&s;embled an army of 16000 men,
advanced upon the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons. Dundalk, where
Monk commanded, was delivered up by the garri&s;on,
who mutinied again&s;t their governor. Tredah, Neury,
and other forts were taken. Dublin was threatened with
a &s;iege; and the affairs of the Lord Lieutenant appeared
in &s;o pro&s;perous a condition, that the young King enter|tained
thoughts of coming in per&s;on into Ireland.</P>
<P>WHEN the Engli&s;h commonwealth was brought to
&s;ome tolerable appearance of &s;ettlement, men began to
ca&s;t their eyes towards the neighbouring i&s;land. During
the conte&s;t of the two parties, the government of Ire|land
had remained a great object of intrigue; and the
pre&s;byterians endeavoured to obtain the lieutenancy for
<PB N="171" REF="233">
Waller, the independents for Lambert. After the exe|cution
of the King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th March.</NOTE> Cromwel him&s;elf began to a&s;pire
to a command, where &s;o much glory, he &s;aw, might be
won, and &s;o much authority acquired. In his ab&s;ence,
he took care to have his name propo&s;ed to the council of
&s;tate; and both friends and enemies concurred imme|diately
to vote him into that important office: The for|mer
&s;u&s;pected, that the matter had not been propo&s;ed
merely by chance, without his own concurrence; the
latter de&s;ired to remove him to a di&s;tance, and hoped,
during his ab&s;ence, to gain the a&s;cendant over Fairfax,
whom he had &s;o long blinded by his hypocritical pro|fe&s;&s;ions.
Cromwel him&s;elf, when informed of his elec|tion,
feigned &s;urprize, and pretended at fir&s;t to he&s;itate
with regard to the acceptance of the command. And
Lambert, either deceived by his di&s;&s;imulation, or, in his
turn, feigning to be deceived, &s;till continued, notwith|&s;tanding
this di&s;appointment, his friend&s;hip and con|nexions
with Cromwel.</P>
<P>THE new Lieutenant immediately applied him&s;elf with
his wonted vigilance to make preparations for his expe|dition.
Many di&s;orders in England it behoved him pre|viou&s;ly
to compo&s;e. All places were full of danger and
inquietude. Tho' men, a&s;toni&s;hed with the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of
the army, remained in &s;eeming tranquillity, &s;ymptoms
of the highe&s;t di&s;content every where appeared. The
Engli&s;h, long accu&s;tomed to a mild government, and
unacquainted with di&s;&s;imulation, could not conform their
&s;peech and countenance to the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, or pre|tend
attachment to a form of government, which they
generally regarded with &s;uch violent abhorrence. It was
requi&s;ite to change the magi&s;tracy of London, and to de|grade,
as well as puni&s;h, the mayor and &s;ome of the al|dermen,
before the proclamation for the abolition of
Monarchy could be publi&s;hed in the city. An engage|ment
being framed to &s;upport the Commonwealth with|out
<PB N="172" REF="234">
King or Hou&s;e of Peers, the army were with &s;ome
difficulty brought to &s;ub&s;cribe it, but tho' it was impo&s;ed
upon the re&s;t of the nation under &s;evere penalties, no
le&s;s than the putting all refu&s;ers out of the protection of
law; &s;uch ob&s;tinate reluctance was ob&s;erved in the peo|ple,
that even the imperious parliament were obliged to
de&s;i&s;t from it. The &s;pirit of fanatici&s;m, by which that
a&s;&s;embly had at fir&s;t been &s;trongly &s;upported, was now
turned, in a great mea&s;ure, again&s;t them. The pulpits,
being chiefly filled with pre&s;byterians, or di&s;gui&s;ed roya|li&s;ts,
and having been long the &s;cence of news and poli|tics,
could by no penalties be re&s;trained from declara|tions,
unfavourable to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. Num|berle&s;s
were the extravagances, which broke out among
the people. Everard, a di&s;banded &s;oldier, having preached
that the time was now come when the community of
goods would be renewed among chri&s;tians, led out his
followers to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land; and being car|ried
before the general, he refu&s;ed to &s;alute him; be|cau&s;e
he was but his fellow creature<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke.</NOTE>. What &s;eemed
more dangerous: The army it&s;elf was infected with like
humors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">The following in&s;tance of extravagance is given by Walker, in his Hi&s;tory of Independency, part II. p. 152. About this time, there came &s;ix &s;oldiers into the pari&s;h church of Walton upon Thames, near twilight; Mr. Faucet, the preacher there, not having till then ended his &s;ermon. One of the &s;ol|diers had a lanthorn in his hand, and a candle burning in it, and in the other hand four candles not lighted. He de&s;ired the pari&s;hioners to &s;tay awhile, &s;aying he had a me&s;&s;age from God unto them, and thereupon offered to go into the pulpit. But the people refu&s;ing to give him leave &s;o to do, or to &s;tay in the church, he went into the church-yard, and there told them, that he had a vi&s;ion wherein he had received a command from God, to deliver his will unto them, which he was to deliver, and they to receive upon pain of damna|tion; con&s;i&s;ting of five lights. (1) &startq;That the &s;abbath was aboli&s;hed as un nece&s;&s;ary, Jewi&s;h, and merely ceremonial. And here (quoth he) I &s;houl$ put out the fir&s;t light, but the wind is &s;o high I cannot kindle it. (2) That tythes are aboli&s;hd as Jewi&s;h and ceremonial, a great burthen to th$ &startq;&s;aints of God, and a di&s;couragement of indu&s;try and tillage. And here I &s;hould put out my &s;econd light, &amp;c. (3.) That mini&s;ters are aboli&s;hed as Antichri&s;tian, and of no longer u&s;e now Chri&s;t him&s;elf de&s;cends into the hearts of his &s;aints, and his &s;pirit enlighteneth them with revelations and in&s;pirations. And here I &s;hould put out my third light, &amp;c. (4.) Ma|gi&s;trates are aboli&s;hed as u&s;ele&s;s now that Chri&s;t him&s;elf is in purity among&s;t us, and hath erected the kingdom of the &s;aints upon earth. Be&s;ides they are tyrants, and oppre&s;&s;ors of the liberty of the &s;aints, and tye them to laws and ordinances, mere human inventions: And here I &s;hould put out my fourth light, &amp;c. (5.) Then putting his hand into his pocket, and pulling out a little bible, he &s;hewed it open to the people, &s;aying, Here is a book you have in great veneration, con&s;r&s;ting of two parts, the old and new Te&s;tament: I mu&s;t tell you it is aboli&s;hed; it containeth beggarly rudi|ments, milk for babes: But now Chri&s;t is in glory among&s;t us, and im|parts a farther mea&s;ure of his &s;pirit to his &s;aints than this can afford. I am commanded to burn it before your face. Then putting out the candle he &s;aid; and here my fifth light is extingur&s;hed.&endq; It became a pretty common doctrine at that time, that it was unworthy of a chri&s;tian man to pay rent to his fellow creatures; and landlords were obliged to u&s;e all the penalties of law again&s;t their tenants, who&s;e con&s;cience was &s;crupulous.</NOTE>. Tho' the levellers had for a time been &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="173" REF="235">
by the audacious &s;pirit of Cromwel, they &s;till
continued to propagate their doctrines among the private
men and inferior officers, who pretended a right to be
con&s;ulted, as before, in the admini&s;tration of the Com|monwealth.
They now practi&s;ed again&s;t their officers
the &s;ame le&s;&s;on, which they had been taught again&s;t the
parliament. They framed a remon&s;trance, and &s;ent five
agitators to pre&s;ent it to the general and council of war;
The&s;e were ca&s;hiered with ignominy by &s;entence of a
court martial. One Lockier, having carried his &s;edition
farther, was &s;entenced to death; but this puni&s;hment
was &s;o far from quelling the mutinous &s;pirit, that above
a thou&s;and of his companions &s;howed their adherence to
him, by attending his funeral, and wearing in their hats
black and &s;ea-green ribbons by way of favours.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Levellers &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> About

lurked in the army, and broke out from time to time,
&s;eemed for the pre&s;ent to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>PETITIONS framed in the &s;ame &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition
were pre&s;ented to the parliament by lieutenant-colonel
Liburn, the per&s;on who, for di&s;per&s;ing &s;editious pamph|lets,
had formerly been treated with &s;uch &s;everity by the
Star Chamber. His liberty was at this time as ill re|li&s;hed
by the parliament, and he was thrown into pri&s;on,
as a promoter of &s;edition and di&s;order in the Common-wealth.
The women applied by petition for his relea&s;e;
but were now de&s;ired to mind their hou&s;hold affairs, and
leave the government of the &s;tate to the men. From
all quarters, the parliament were harra&s;&s;ed with petitions
of a very free nature, which &s;trongly &s;poke the &s;en&s;e of
the nation, and proved how ardently all men longed for
the re&s;oration of their laws and liberties. Even in a
fea&s;t, which the city gave to the parliament and council
of &s;tate, it was e&s;teemed a requi&s;ite precaution, if we
may credit Walker and Dugdale, to &s;wear all the cooks,
that they would &s;erve nothing but whole&s;ome food to
them.</P>
<P>THE parliament judged it nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge the
laws of high-trea&s;on beyond tho&s;e narrow bounds, within
which they had been confined during the monarchy.
They even comprehended verbal offences, nay inten|tions,
tho' they had never appeared in any overt-act
again&s;t the &s;tate. To affirm the pre&s;ent government to
be an u&s;urpation, to a&s;&s;ert that the parliament or council
of &s;tate were tyrannical or illegal, to endeavour the &s;ub|verting
their authority or &s;tirring up &s;edition again&s;t
them; the&s;e offences were declared to be high-trea&s;on.
<PB N="175" REF="237">
The power of impri&s;onment, of which the petition of
right had bereaved the King, it was now found requi&s;ite
to re&s;tore to the council of &s;tate; and all the jails of
England were filled with men whom the jealou&s;ies and
fears of the ruling party had repre&s;ented as dangerous<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;tory of Independency, part II.</NOTE>.
The taxes continued by the new government, and which,
being unu&s;ual, were e&s;teemed heavy, encrea&s;ed the ge|neral
ill will under which it labored. Be&s;ides the cu&s;toms
and exci&s;e, ninety thou&s;and pounds a month were levied
on land for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the army. The &s;eque&s;tra|tions
and compo&s;itions of the royali&s;ts, the &s;ale of the
crown lands, and of the dean and chapter lands, tho'
they yielded immen&s;e &s;ums, were not &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply
the va&s;t expences, and, as was &s;u&s;pected, the great
depredations, of the parliament and of their creatures.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the&s;e difficulties and di&s;turbances, the
fteddy mind of Cromwel, without confu&s;ion or embarra&s;&s;|ment,
&s;till pur&s;ued its purpofe. While he was collect|ing
an army of twelve thou&s;and men in the we&s;t of Eng|land,
he &s;ent to Ireland under Reynolds and Venables, a
reinforcement of four thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot, in order
to &s;trengthen Jones, and enable him to defend him&s;elf
again&s;t the Marque&s;s of Ormond, who lay at Fingla&s;s
and began to threaten Dublin. Inchiquin, with a &s;epa|rate
body, having taken Tredah and Dundalk, gave a
defeat to Offarrell who &s;erved under Oneal, and to
young Coot who commanded &s;ome parliamentary forces
After he had joined his troops to the main army, with
whom, for &s;ome time, he remair$ed united, Ormond
pa&s;&s;ed the river Liffy, and took po&s;t at Rathmines two
miles from Dublin, with a view of commencing the &s;iege
of that city. In order to cut off all farther &s;upply from
Jones, he had begun the reparation of an old fort, which
lay at the gates of Dublin; and being exhau&s;ted with
continual fatigue for &s;ome days, he had retired to re&s;t,
<PB N="176" REF="238">
after leaving orders to keep his forces under arms. He
was &s;uddenly awaked with the noi&s;e of firing; and &s;tart|ing
from his bed, &s;aw every thing already in tumult and
confu&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Augu&s;t.</NOTE> Jones, an excellent officer, formerly a law|yer,
had &s;allied out with the reinforcement newly ar|rived;
and attacking the party employed in repairing the
fort, he totally routed them, pur&s;ued the advantage, and
fell in with the army, which had neglected Ormond's
orders. The&s;e he &s;oon threw into di&s;order; put them
to flight, in &s;pite of all the efforts of the Lord-Lieute|nant;
chaced them off the field; &s;eized all their tents,
baggage, ammunition; and returned victorious to Dublin,
after killing three thou&s;and men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Siege of Dub|lin rai&s;ed.</NOTE> and taking above two
thou&s;and pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS lo&s;s, which threw &s;ome blemi&s;h on the military
character of Ormond, was irreparable to the royal cau&s;e.
That numerous army, which, with &s;o much pains and
difficulty, the Lord-Lieutenant had been collecting for
more than a year, was di&s;per&s;ed in a moment. Crom|wel
&s;oon after arrived in Dublin, where he was welcomed
with mighty &s;houts and rejoicings. He ha&s;tened imme|diately
to Tredah. That town was well fortified; and
Ormond had thrown into it a good garri&s;on of three
thou&s;and men, under Sir Arthur A&s;ton, an officer of re|putation.
He expected that Tredah, lying in the neigh|bourhood
of Dublin, would fir&s;t be attempted by Crom|wel,
and he was willing to employ the enemy &s;ome time
in that &s;iege, while he him&s;elf &s;hould repair his broken
forces. But Cromwel knew the importance of di&s;path.
Having made a breach, he ordered a general a&s;&s;ault.
Tho' twice repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">September. Tredah &s;tormed.</NOTE> he renewed the at|tack,
and him&s;elf, along with Ireton, led on his men.
All oppo&s;ition was overborne by the furious valour of the
troops. The town was taken &s;word in hand; and orders
being i&s;&s;ued to give no quarter, a cruel &s;laughter was
made of the garri&s;on. Even a few, who were &s;aved by
<PB N="177" REF="239">
the &s;oldiers, &s;atiated with blood, were next day mi&s;erably
butchered by orders from the general. One per&s;on
alone of the whole garri&s;on e&s;caped to be a me&s;&s;enger of
this univer&s;al havock and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>CROMWEL pretended by this &s;evere execution to reta|liate
the cruelty of the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre: But he well
knew, that almo&s;t the whole garri&s;on was Engli&s;h; and
his ju&s;tice was only a barbarous policy, in order to ter|rify
all other garri&s;ons from re&s;i&s;tance. His policy, how|ever,
had the de&s;ired effect. Having led the army with|out
delay to Wexford, he began to batter the town.
The garri&s;on after a &s;light defence offered to capitulate;
but before they obtained a ce&s;&s;ation, they imprudently
neglected their guards; and the Engli&s;h army ru&s;hed in
upon them. The &s;ame &s;everity was exerci&s;ed as at
Tredah.</P>
<P>EVERY town, before which Cromwel pre&s;ented him|&s;elf,
now opened its gates without re&s;i&s;tance. Ro&s;s,
tho' &s;trongly garri&s;oned, was &s;urrendered by Lord Taffe.
Having taken E&s;tionage; Cromwel<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> threw a bridge over
the Barrow, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Pa&s;&s;age and
Carric. Owen Oneale &s;ubmitted at di&s;cretion, and
&s;oon afterwards died. The Engli&s;h had no difficulties
to encounter but what aro&s;e from fatigue and the ad|vanced
&s;ea&s;on. Fluxes and contagious di&s;tempers crept
in among the &s;oldiers, who peri&s;hed in great numbers.
Jones him&s;elf, the brave governor of Dublin, died at
Wexford. And Cromwel had &s;o far advanced with his
decayed army, that he began to find it difficult, either
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the enemies country, or retreat to his own
garri&s;ons. But while he was in the&s;e &s;traits, Corke,
Kin&s;ale, and all the Engli&s;h garri&s;ons in Mun&s;ter de|&s;erted
to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> and opening their gates re&s;olved to &s;hare
the fortunes of their victorious countrymen.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="240">
THIS de&s;ertion of the Engli&s;h put an end entirely to<NOTE PLACE="marg">1650.</NOTE>
Ormond's authority, which was already much dimini&s;hed
by the misfortunes at Dublin, Tredah and Wexford.
The Iri&s;h, actuated by national and religious prejudices,
could no longer be kept in obedience by a prote&s;tant
governor, who was &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in all his enterprizes.
The clergy renewed their excommunications again&s;t him
and his adherents, and added the terrors of &s;uper&s;tition
to tho&s;e ari&s;ing from a victorious enemy. Cromwel
having received a reinforcement from England, again
took the field early in the &s;pring. After a &s;iege, he made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Kilkenny, the only place where he
met with any vigorous re&s;i&s;tance. The whole frame of
the Iri&s;h union being in a manner di&s;&s;olved, Ormond,
&s;oon after, left the i&s;land, and delegated his authority
to Clanricarde, who found affairs &s;o de&s;perate as to ad|mit
of no remedy. The Iri&s;h were glad to embrace ba|ni&s;hment
as a refuge. Above 40,000 men pa&s;&s;ed into
foreign &s;ervice; and Cromwel, well-plea&s;ed to free the
i&s;land from enemies, who never could be cordially re|conciled
to the Engli&s;h, gave them full liberty and lei|&s;ure
for their embarkation.</P>
<P>WHILE Cromwel proceeded with &s;uch uninterrupted
&s;ucce&s;s in Ireland, which in the &s;pace of nine months
he had almo&s;t entirely &s;ubdued, fortune was preparing
for him a new &s;cene of victory and triumph in Scotland.
Charles was at the Hague, when Sir Jo&s;eph Douglas
brought him intelligence, that he was proclaimed King
by the Scots parliment. At the &s;ame time, Douglas
informed him of the hard conditions annexed to the pro|clamation,
and damped extremely that joy, which might
ari&s;e from his being recognized &s;overeign in one of his
kingdoms. Charles too confidered, that tho&s;e who pre|tended
to acknowlege his title, were at that very time
in actual rebellion again&s;t his family, and would be &s;ure
<PB N="179" REF="241">
to intru&s;t very little authority into his hands, and &s;carcely
would afford him per&s;onal liberty and &s;ecurity. As the
pro&s;pect of affairs in Ireland was at that time very pro|mi&s;ing,
he intended rather to try his fortune in that
kingdom, from which he expected more dutiful &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion
and obedience.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE he found it expedient to depart from
Holland. The people in the United Provinces were
much attached to his intere&s;ts. Be&s;ides his connexion
with the family of Orange, which was extremely be|loved
by the populace, all men regarded with compa&s;|&s;ion
his helple&s;s condition, and expre&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t ab|horrence
again&s;t the murder of his father; a deed, to
which nothing they thought, but the rage of fanatici&s;m
and faction could have impelled the parliament. But
tho' the public in general bore a great favour to the
King, the States were unea&s;y at his pre&s;ence. They
dreaded the parliament, &s;o formidable by their power,
and &s;o pro&s;perous in all their enterprizes. They ap|prehended
the mo&s;t precipitant re&s;olutions from men
of &s;uch violent and haughty di&s;po&s;tions. And after the
murder of Dori&s;laus, they found it &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary
to &s;atisfy the Engli&s;h Commonwealth, by removing the
King at a di&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>DORISLAUS, tho' a native of Holland, had lived long
in England; and being employed as a&s;&s;i&s;tant to the
high court of ju&s;tice, which condemned the King, he
had ri&s;en to great credit and favour with the ruling party.
They &s;ent him envoy into Holland; but no &s;ooner had
he arrived at the Hague, than he was &s;et upon by &s;ome
royali&s;ts, chiefly retainers to Montro&s;e. They ru&s;hed
into the room, where he was &s;itting with &s;ome compa|ny;
dragg'd him from the table; put him to death as
the fir&s;t victim to their murder'd &s;overeign; very lei&s;urely
and peaceably &s;eparated them&s;elves; and tho' orders
were i&s;tued by the magi&s;trates to arre&s;t them, the&s;e were
<PB N="180" REF="242">
executed with &s;uch &s;lowne&s;s and reluctance, that the
criminals had, all of them, the opportunity to make
their e&s;cape.</P>
<P>CHARLES, having pa&s;s'd &s;ome time at Paris, where no
a&s;&s;i&s;tance was given him, and even few civilities were
paid him, made his retreat into Jer&s;ey, where his autho|rity
was &s;till acknowleged. Winram, laird of Liberton,
came to him as deputy from the committee of e&s;tates in
Scotland, and informed him of the conditions, to which
he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubmit before he could be admitted
to the exerci&s;e of his authority. Conditions more &s;e|vere,
were never impo&s;ed by &s;ubjects upon their &s;ove|reign;
but as the affairs of Ireland began extremely to
decline, and the King found it no longer &s;afe to ven|ture
him&s;elf in that i&s;land, he gave a civil an&s;wer to
Winram, and de&s;ired commi&s;&s;ioners to meet him at
Breda, in order to enter into a treaty with regard to
the&s;e conditions.</P>
<P>THE earls of Ca&s;&s;ilis and Lothian, the lord Burley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenanters.</NOTE>
the laird of Liberton and other commi&s;&s;ioners arrived at
Breda; but without any power of treating: The King
mu&s;t &s;ubmit without re&s;erve to the terms impo&s;ed upon
him. The terms were, That he &s;hould i&s;&s;ue a procla|mation,
bani&s;hing from court all excommunicated per|&s;ons,
that is, all tho&s;e, who either under Hamilton or
Montro&s;e, had ventured their lives for his family; that
no Engli&s;h &s;ubject, who had &s;erved again&s;t the par|liament,
&s;hould be allowed to approach him; that
he &s;hould bind him&s;elf by his royal promi&s;e to take
the covenant; that he &s;hould ratify all acts of par|liament,
by which pre&s;byterian government, the di|rectory
of wor&s;hip, confe&s;&s;ion of faith and catechi&s;m
were enjoined; and that in civil affairs he &s;hould
govern him&s;elf entirely according to the direction of
parliament, and in eccle&s;ia&s;tical according to that of
the a&s;&s;embly. The&s;e propo&s;als, the commi&s;&s;ioners, after
<PB N="181" REF="243">
pa&s;&s;ing &s;ome time in &s;ermons and prayers, in order to
expre&s;s the more determined re&s;olution, very &s;olemnly
delivered to the King.</P>
<P>THE King's friends were extremely divided with re|gard
to the part, which he &s;hould act in this critical
conjuncture. Mo&s;t of his Engli&s;h coun&s;ellors di&s;&s;uaded
him from accepting conditions, &s;o di&s;advantageous and
di&s;honourable. They &s;aid, that the men, who now go|verned
Scotland, were the mo&s;t furious and bigotted of
that party, which, notwith&s;tanding his gentle govern|ment,
had fir&s;t excited a rebellion again&s;t the late King;
after the mo&s;t unlimited conce&s;&s;ions, had renewed their
rebellion, and &s;topt the progre&s;s of his victories in Eng|land;
and after he had entru&s;ted his per&s;on with them in
his uttermo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s, had ba&s;ely &s;old him, together with
their own honour, to his barbarous enemies: That they
had as yet &s;hown no marks of repentance, and even in
the terms, which they now propo&s;ed, di&s;played the &s;ame
antimonarchical principles, and the &s;ame jealou&s;y of
their Sovereign, by which they had ever been actuated:
That nothing could be more di&s;honourable, than that
the King, in his fir&s;t enterprize, &s;hould &s;acrifice, merely
for the empty name of royalty, tho&s;e principles, for
which his father had died a martyr, and in which he
him&s;elf had been &s;trictly educated: That by this hypo|cri&s;y
he might lo&s;e the royali&s;ts, who alone were &s;in|cerely
attached to him; but never would gain the pre&s;by|terians,
who were aver&s;e to his family and his cau&s;e,
and would a&s;cribe his compliance merely to policy and
nece&s;&s;ity: That the Scots had refu&s;ed to give him any
a&s;&s;urances of their intending to re&s;tore him to the throne
of England; and could they even be engaged to make
&s;uch an attempt, it had &s;ufficiently appeared, by the
event of Hamilton's engagement, how unequal their
force was to &s;o great an enterprize: That on the fir&s;t

check, which they &s;hould receive, Argyle and his par|tizans
would lay hold of the quicke&s;t expedient for re|conciling
them&s;elves to the Engli&s;h parliament, and
would betray the King, as they had done his father, into
the hands of his enemies: And that, however de&s;perate
the royal cau&s;e, it mu&s;t &s;till be regarded as highly im|prudent
in the King to make a &s;acrifice of his honour;
where the &s;ole purcha&s;e was to endanger his life or li|berty.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Laneric, now Duke of Hamilton, the
Earl of Lauderdale, and others of that party, who had
been bani&s;hed their country for the late engagement,
were then with the King; and being de&s;irous of return|ing
home in his retinue, they joined the opinion of the
young Duke of Buckingham, and very earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed
him to accept the conditions required of him. It was
urged, that nothing would more gratify the King's ene|mies
than to &s;ee him fall into the &s;nare laid for him, and
by &s;o &s;crupulous a nicety leave the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his do|minions
to tho&s;e who de&s;ired but a pretence for exclud|ing
him: That Argyle, not daring &s;o far to oppo&s;e the
bent of the nation as to throw off all allegiance to his
&s;overeign, had embraced this expedient, by which he
hoped to make Charles dethrone him&s;elf, and refu&s;e a
kingdom, which was offered him: That it was not to
be doubted but the &s;ame national &s;pirit, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Ha|milton
and his party, would &s;till ri&s;e higher in favour of
their Prince after he had intru&s;ted him&s;elf to their fide|lity,
and would much abate the rigor of the conditios,
now impo&s;ed upon him: That whatever might be the
pre&s;ent intentions of the ruling party, they mu&s;t un|avoidably
be engaged in a war with England, and mu&s;t
accept the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the King's friends of all parties,
in order to &s;upport them&s;elves again&s;t a power, &s;o much
&s;uperior: That however a &s;teddy, uniform conduct
might have been &s;uitable to the advanced age, and &s;trict
<PB N="183" REF="247">
engagements of the late King, no one would throw any
blame on a young Prince for complying with conditions,
which nece&s;&s;ity had extorted from him: That even the
rigour of tho&s;e principles, profe&s;&s;ed by his father, tho'
with &s;ome it had exalted his character, had been ex|tremely
prejudicial to his intere&s;t; nor could any thing
be more &s;erviceable to the royal cau&s;e than to give all
parties room to hope for more equal and more indulgent
maxims of government: And that where affairs were
reduced to &s;o de&s;perate a &s;ituation, dangers ought little
to be regarded; and the King's honour lay rather in
&s;howing &s;ome early &s;ymptoms of courage and activity,
than in choo&s;ing &s;trictly a Party among theological con|trover&s;ies,
with which, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, he was,
as yet, very little acquainted.</P>
<P>THESE arguments, &s;econded by the advice of the
Queen and of the Prince of Orange, the King's brother
in law, who both of them e&s;teemed it ridiculous to re|fu&s;e
a kingdom, merely from regard to epi&s;copacy, had
great influence on Charles. But what chiefly determined
him to comply was the account brought him of the fate
of Montro&s;e, who, with all the circum&s;tances of rage
and contumely, had been put to death by his zealous
countrymen. Though in this in&s;tance the King &s;aw
more evidently the furious &s;pirit, by which the Scots
were actuated, he had now no farther re&s;ource, and was
obliged to grant whatever was demanded of him.</P>
<P>MONTROSE, having laid down his arms at the com|mand
of the late King, had retired into France, and,
contrary to his natural di&s;po&s;ition, lived for &s;ome time
inactive at Paris. He there became acquainted with the
famous Cardinal de Retz; and that penetrating judge
celebrates him in his memoirs as one of tho&s;e heroes, of
whom there are no longer any remains in the world, and
who are only to be met with in Plutarch. De&s;irous of
improving his martial genius, he took a journey to Ger|many,
<PB N="184" REF="248">
was care&s;&s;ed by the Emperor, received the rank
of Mare&s;chal, and propo&s;ed to levy a regiment for the
Imperial &s;ervice. While employed for that purpo&s;e in
the Low Countries, he heard of the tragical death of
the King; and at the &s;ame time received from his
young ma&s;ter a renewal of his commi&s;&s;ion of Captain
General in Scotland<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Clarendon.</NOTE>. His ardent and daring &s;pirit
needed but this authority to put him in action. He ga|thered
followers in Holland and the north of Germany,
whom his great reputation allured to him. The King
of Denmark and Duke of Hol&s;tein &s;ent him &s;ome &s;mall
&s;upplies of money: The Queen of Sweden furni&s;hed
him with arms: The Prince of Orange with &s;hips:
And Montro&s;e, ha&s;tening his enterprize, le&s;t the King's
agreement with the Scots &s;hould make him revoke his
commi&s;&s;ion, &s;et out for the Orkneys with about 500
men, mo&s;t of them Germans. The&s;e were all the pre|parations,
which he could make again&s;t a kingdom,
&s;ettled in dome&s;tic peace, &s;upported by a di&s;ciplined
army, fully apprized of his enterprize, and prepared
again&s;t him. Some of his retainers having told him of a
prophe&s;y, that <HI>to him and him alone it was reserved to re|store
the King's authority in all his dominions;</HI> he lent a
willing ear to &s;ugge&s;tions, which, however ill grounded
or improbable, were &s;o conformable to his own magna|nimous
di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>HE armed &s;everal of the inhabitants of the Orkneys,
though an unwarlike people, and carried them over with
him to Caithne&s;s; hoping, that the general affection to
the King's &s;ervice, and the fame of his former exploits,
would make the Highlanders flock to his &s;tandard. But
all men were now harra&s;&s;ed and fatigued with wars and
di&s;orders: Many of tho&s;e, who formerly adhered to him,
had been &s;everely puni&s;hed by the covenanters: And no
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s was entertained in oppo&s;ition to &s;o
<PB N="185" REF="249">
great a force as was drawn together again&s;t him. But
however weak Montro&s;e's army, the memory of pa&s;t
events &s;truck a great terror into the committee of e&s;tates.
They immediately ordered Le&s;ley and Holborne to march
again&s;t him with an army of 4000 men. Strahan was
&s;ent before with a body of cavalry to check his progre&s;s.
He fell unexpectedly on Montro&s;e, who had no hor&s;e to
bring him intelligence. The royali&s;ts were put to
flight; all of them either killed or taken pri&s;oners; and
Montro&s;e him&s;elf, having put on the di&s;gui&s;e of a pea|&s;ant,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montro&s;e taken pri|&s;oner.</NOTE>
was perfidiou&s;ly delivered into the hands of his
enemies, by a friend, to whom he had entru&s;ted his
per&s;on.</P>
<P>ALL the in&s;olence, which &s;ucce&s;s can produce in un|generous
minds, was exerci&s;ed by the covenanters again&s;t
Montro&s;e, whom they &s;o much hated and &s;o much
dreaded. Theological antipathy farther encrea&s;ed their
indignities towards a per&s;on whom they regarded as exe|crable
on account of the excommunication, which had
been pronounced again&s;t him. Le&s;ley led him about for
&s;everal days in the &s;ame low habit, under which he had
di&s;gui&s;ed him&s;elf. The vulgar, wherever he pa&s;&s;ed, were
in&s;tigated to reproach and vilify him. When he came
to Edinburgh, every circum&s;tance of elaborate rage and
in&s;ult was put in practice by order of the parliament.
At the ea&s;tern gate of the city, he was met by the ma|gi&s;trates,
and put into a new cart, purpo&s;ely made with
a high chair or bench, where he was placed, that the
people might have a full view of him. He was bound
with a cord, drawn over his brea&s;t and &s;houl$ers, and
fa&s;tened through holes made in the cart. When in this
po&s;ture, the hangman took off the hat of the noble pri|&s;oner,
and rode him&s;elf before the cart in his livery, and
with his bonnet on; the other officers, who were taken
pri&s;oners with the Marque&s;s, walking two and two be|fore
them.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="250">
THE populace, more generous and humane, when
they &s;aw &s;o mighty a change of fortune in this great
man, &s;o lately their dread and terror, into who&s;e hands
the magi&s;trates, a few years before, had delivered on
their knees the keys of the city, were &s;truck with com|pa&s;&s;ion,
and viewed him with &s;ilent tears and admira|tion.
The preachers, next Sunday, exclaimed again&s;t
the&s;e movements of rebel nature, as they expre&s;&s;ed it:
and reproached the people with their profane tenderne&s;s
towards this capital enemy of all piety and religion.</P>
<P>WHEN he was carried before the parliament, which
was then fitting, Loudon, the chancellor, in a violent
declamation, reproached him with the breach of the na|tional
covenant, which he had &s;ub&s;cribed; his rebellion
again&s;t God, the King, and the kingdom; and the
many horrible murders, trea&s;ons, and impieties, for
which he was now to be brought to condign puni&s;h|ment.
Montro&s;e in his an&s;wer maintained the &s;ame
&s;uperiority above his enemies, to which, by his fame
and great actions, as well as by the con&s;cience of a good
cau&s;e, he was ju&s;tly entitled. He told the parliament,
that &s;ince the King, as he was informed, had &s;o far
avowed their authority as to enter into treaty with them,
he now appeared uncovered before their tribunal; a re|&s;pect,
which, while they &s;tood in open defiance to their
&s;overeign, they would in vain have required of him.
That he acknowledged with infinite &s;hame and remor&s;e
the errors of his early conduct, when their plau&s;ible pre|tences
had &s;educed him to tread with them the paths of
rebellion, and bear arms again&s;t his prince and country.
That his following &s;ervices, he hoped, had &s;ufficiently
te&s;tified his repentance, and his death would now atone
for that guilt, the only one with which he could ju&s;tly
reproach him&s;elf. That in all his warlike enterprizes
he was warranted by that commi&s;&s;ion, which he had re|ceived
<PB N="187" REF="251">
from his and their ma&s;ter, again&s;t who&s;e lawful
authority they had erected their &s;tandard. That to ven|ture
his life for his &s;overeign was the lea&s;t part of his
merit: He had even thrown down his arms in obedience
to the &s;acred commands of the King; and had re&s;igned
to them the victory, which, in defiance of all their ef|forts,
he was &s;till enabled to di&s;pute with them. That
no blood had ever been &s;hed by him but in the field of
battle; and many per&s;ons were now in his eye, many
now dared to pronounce &s;entence of death upon him,
who&s;e life, forfeited by the laws of war, he had formerly
&s;aved from the fury of the &s;oldiers. That he was &s;orry
to find no better te&s;timony of their return to allegiance
than the murder of &s;o faithful a &s;ubject, in who&s;e death
the King's commi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be at once &s;o highly in|jured
and affronted. That as to him&s;elf they had in
vain endeavoured to vilify and degrade him by all their
&s;tudied indignities: The ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, he knew,
would enoble any fortune; nor had he other affliction
than to &s;ee the authority of his Prince, with which he
was inve&s;ted, treated with &s;o much ignominy. And
that he now joyfully followed, by a like unju&s;t &s;entence,
his late &s;overeign; and &s;hould be happy, if, in his fu|ture
de&s;tiny, he could follow him to the &s;ame bli&s;sful
man&s;ions, where his piety and humane virtues had al|ready,
without doubt, &s;ecured him an eternal recom|pence.</P>
<P>MONTROSE'S &s;entence was next pronounced again&s;t
him, &startq;That he, James Graham&endq; (for this was the
only name they vouch&s;afed to give him) &startq;&s;hould next
day be carried to Edinburgh cro&s;s, and there be
hanged on a gibbet, thirty foot high, for the &s;pace of
three hours: Then be taken down, his head be cut
off upon a &s;caffold, and affixed to the pri&s;on: His
legs and arms be &s;tuck up on the four chief towns of
the kingdom: His body be buried in the place appro|priated

for common malefactors; except the church,

<P>THE clergy, hoping, that the terrors of immediate
death had now given them an advantage over their ene|my,
flocked about him, and in&s;ulted over his fallen for|tunes.
They pronounced his damnation, and a&s;&s;ured
him, that the judgment, which he was &s;o &s;oon to &s;uf|fer,
would prove but an ea&s;y prologue to that which he
mu&s;t undergo hereafter. They next offered to pray with
him: But he was too well acquainted with tho&s;e forms
of imprecation, which they called prayers. &startq;Lord,
vouch&s;afe yet to touch the obdurate heart of this
proud incorrigible &s;inner; this wicked, perjured,
traiterous, and profane per&s;on, who refu&s;es to hearken
to the voice of thy church.&endq; Such were the petitions
which he expected they would, according to cu&s;tom, of|fer
up for him. He told them, that they were a mi&s;erable
deluded and deluding people; and would &s;hortly bring
their country under the mo&s;t in&s;upportable &s;ervitude, to
which any nation had ever been reduced. &startq;For my
part,&endq; added he, &startq;I am much prouder to have my
head affixed to the place, where it is &s;entenced to &s;tand,
than to have my picture hang in the King's bed|chamber.
So far from being &s;orry, that my legs and
arms are to be &s;ent to four cities of the kingdom; I
wi&s;h I had limbs enough to be di&s;per&s;ed into all the
cities of Chri&s;tendom, there to remain as te&s;timonies
in favour of the cau&s;e, for which I &s;uffer.&endq; This
&s;entiment, that very evening, while in pri&s;on, he threw
into ver&s;e. The poem remains; a &s;ignal monument of
his heroic &s;pirit, and no de&s;picable proof of his poetical
genius.</P>
<P>NOW was led forth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$word$ of May.</NOTE> amid&s;t the in&s;ults of his enemies
and the tears of the people, the man of the mo&s;t illu&s;tri|ous
birth and greate&s;t renown of the nation, to &s;uffer,
<PB N="189" REF="255">
for his adherence to the laws of his country, and the
rights of his &s;overeign, the ignominious death de&s;tined
to the meane&s;t malefactor. Every attempt, which the
in&s;olence of the governing party had made to &s;ubdue his
gallant &s;pirit, had hitherto proved fruitle&s;s: They made
yet one effort more, in this la&s;t and melancholy &s;cene,
when all enmity, ari&s;ing from motives merely human,
is commonly &s;oftened and di&s;armed. The executioner
brought that book, which had been publi&s;hed in elegant
Latin of his truly heroic actions, and tied it by a cord
about his neck. Montro&s;e &s;miled at this new in&s;tance
of their malice. He thanked them, however, for their
officious zeal; and &s;aid, that he bore this te&s;timony of
his bravery and loyalty with more pride than he had ever
worne the garter. Having a&s;ked, whether they had any
more indignities to put upon him, and renewing &s;ome
devout ejaculations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execute$.</NOTE> he patiently endured the la&s;t act of
the executioner.</P>
<P>THUS peri&s;hed, in the thirty-eighth year of his age,
the gallant marque&s;s of Montro&s;e; the man who&s;e mili|tary
genius, both by valour and conduct, had &s;hone
forth beyond any, which, during the&s;e civil di&s;orders,
had appeared in the three kingdoms. The finer arts too,
in his youth, he had &s;ucce&s;sfully cultivated; and whatever
was &s;ublime, elegant, or noble touched his great &s;oul.
Nor was he in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ures either of &s;ociety
or of love. Something, however, of the <HI>vast and unbound|ed</HI>
characterized all his actions and deportment; and it
was merely by an heroic effort of duty, that he brought
his mind, impatient of &s;uperiority, and even of equa|lity,
to pay &s;uch unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of his
&s;overeign.</P>
<P>THE vengeance of the covenanters was not &s;atisfied
with Montro&s;e's execution. Urrey, who&s;e incon&s;tancy
now led him to take part with the King, &s;uffered about
<PB N="190" REF="256">
the &s;ame time: Spoti&s;wood of Daer&s;ie, a youth of eigh|teen,
Sir Francis Hay of Dalgetie, and Colonel Sib|bald,
all of them men of birth and character, under|went
a like fate. The&s;e were taken pri&s;oners with
Montro&s;e. The Marque&s;s of Huntley, about a year
before, had al&s;o fallen a victim to the &s;everity of the co|venanters.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;t &s;cene di&s;plays in a full light the barbarity
of this theological faction: The &s;equel will &s;ufficiently
di&s;cover their ab&s;urdities. The corruptions of the be&s;t
things produce the wor&s;t; and no wonder that the abu&s;$s
of religion &s;hould of all others be the mo&s;t odious and
ridiculous. In order to convey a ju&s;t notion of the ge|nius
of the age, we are obliged &s;ometimes in our narra|tion
to make u&s;e of the &s;ame cant and expre&s;&s;ion, which
was then &s;o prevalent.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of June.</NOTE> in con&s;equence of his agreemeent with
the Scots commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;et &s;ail for Scotland; and be|ing
e&s;corted by &s;even Dutch &s;hips of war, who were
&s;ent to guard the herring fi&s;hery, he arrived in the firth
of Cromarty. Before he was permitted to land, he was
required to &s;ign the covenant; and many &s;ermons and
lectures were made him, exhorting him to per&s;evere in
that holy confederacy<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Hi&s;torical Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 159.</NOTE>. Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Covenanteers</NOTE> Lauderdale, Dum|fermling,
and other noblemen of that faction whom
they called Engagers, were immediately &s;eparated
from him, and obliged to retire to their hou&s;es, where
they lived in a private manner, without tru&s;t or autho|rity.
None of his Engli&s;h friends, who had &s;erved his
father, were allowed to remain in the kingdom. The
King him&s;elf found, that he was con&s;idered as a mere
pageant of &s;tate, and that the few remains of royalty,
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;erved only to draw on him the
greater indignities. One of the quarters of Montro&s;e,
his faithful &s;ervant, who had borne his commi&s;&s;ion, he
<PB N="191" REF="257">
found hanging at Aberdeen.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Hi&s;torical Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 160.</NOTE> The general a&s;&s;embly,
and afterwards the committee of e&s;tates and the army,
who were entirely governed by the a&s;&s;embly, &s;et forth a
public declaration, in which they prote&s;ted, &startq;that they
did not e&s;pou&s;e any malignant quarrel or party, but
fought merely on their former grounds or principles;
that they di&s;claimed all the &s;ins and guilt of the
King, and of his hou&s;e; nor would they own him or
his intere&s;t, otherwi&s;e than with a &s;ubordination to
God, and &s;o far as he owned and pro&s;ecuted the cau&s;e
of God, and acknowleged the &s;ins of his hou&s;e, and
of his former ways<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 166, 167.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King, lying entirely at mercy, and having no
a&s;&s;urance of liberty or life, farther than was agreeable to
the fancy of the&s;e au&s;tere zealots, was con&s;trained to
embrace a mea&s;ure, which nothing but the nece&s;&s;ity of
his affairs, and his great youth and inexperince could
excu&s;e. He i&s;&s;ued a declaration, &s;uch as they required
of him<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 170.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> He there gave thanks for the merciful di&s;pen|&s;ations
of providence, by which he was recovered out
of the &s;nare of evil councils, had attained a full per&s;ua|&s;ion
of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the covenant, and was in|duced
to ca&s;t him&s;elf and his intere&s;t wholly upon God.
He de&s;ired to be deeply humbled and afflicted in &s;pirit,
becau&s;e of his father's following evil council, oppo&s;ing
the covenant and the work of reformation, and &s;hedding
the blood of God's people through all his dominions.
He lamented the idolatry of his mother and the tolera|tion
of it in his father's hou&s;e; a matter of great of|fence,
he &s;aid, to all the prote&s;tant churches, and a
great provocation to him who is a jealous God, vi&s;iting
the &s;ins of the father upon the children. He profe&s;&s;ed,
that he would have no enemies but the enemies of the
<PB N="192" REF="258">
covenant; and that he dete&s;ted all popery, &s;uper&s;tition,
prelacy, here&s;y, &s;chi&s;m, and profanene&s;s; and was re|&s;olved
not to tolerate, much le&s;s to countenance
any of them in any of his dominions. He declared,
that he would never love nor favour any who have
&s;o little con&s;cience as to follow his intere&s;ts, in
preference to the go&s;pel and the kingdom of Je&s;us
Chri&s;t. And he expre&s;&s;ed his hope, that whatever ill
&s;ucce&s;s his former guilt might have drawn upon his
cau&s;e, yet now, having obtained mercy to be on God's
&s;ide, and to acknowlege his own cau&s;e &s;ubordinate to
that of God, the divine providence would crown his
arms with victory.</P>
<P>STILL the covenanters and the clergy were diffident
of the King's &s;incerity. The facility, which he di&s;co|vered
in yielding to whatever was required of him, made
them &s;u&s;pect that he regarded all his conce&s;&s;ions merely
as ridiculous farces, to which he mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;ub|mit.
They had another trial prepared for him. In|&s;tead
of the &s;olemnity of his coronation, which was de|layed,
they were re&s;olved, that he &s;hould pa&s;s through
a public humiliation, and do penance before the whole
people. They &s;ent him twelve articles of repentance,
which he was to acknowlege; and the King had agreed,
that he would &s;ubmit to this indignity. The various
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of his father and grandfather, together
with the idolatry of his mother, are again enumerated
and aggravated in the&s;e articles; and farther declarations
were in&s;i&s;ted on, that he &s;ought the re&s;titution of his
rights, for the &s;ole advancement of religion, and in &s;ubor|dination
to the kingdom of Chri&s;t<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker's Hi&s;torical Di&s;cour&s;es, p. 178.</NOTE>. In &s;hort, having ex|alted
the altar above the throne, and brought royalty under
their feet, the clergy were re&s;olved to trample on it and
vilify it, by every in&s;tance of contumely, which their
<PB N="193" REF="259">
pre&s;ent influence enabled them to impo&s;e upon their un|happy
prince.</P>
<P>CHARLES in the mean time found his authority en|tirely
annihilated, as well as his character degraded. He
was con&s;ulted in no public mea&s;ure. He was not called
to a&s;&s;i&s;t at any councils. His choice was &s;ufficient to
di&s;credit any pretender to office or advancement. All
efforts, which he made to unite the oppo&s;ite parties, en|crea&s;ed
the &s;u&s;picion, which the covenanters had enter|tained
of him, as if he was not entirely their own. Ar|gyle,
who by &s;ubtilties and compliances, partly led and
partly was governed by this wild faction, &s;till turned a
deaf ear to all advances, which the King made to enter
into confidence with him. <HI>Malignants</HI> and <HI>Engagers</HI> con|tinued
to be the objects of general hatred and per&s;ecu|tion;
and whoever was di&s;agreeable to the clergy failed
not to have one of the&s;e epithets affixed to him. The fa|natici&s;m,
which prevailed, being &s;o full of &s;our and
angry principles, and &s;o overcharged with various anti|pathies,
had acquired a new object of abhorrence:
The&s;e were the <HI>Sorcerers.</HI> So prevalent was the opinion
of witchcraft, that great numbers, accu&s;ed of that
crime, were burnt by &s;entence of the magi&s;trates thro'
all parts of Scotland. In a village near Berwic, which
contained only fourteen hou&s;es, fourteen per&s;ons were
puni&s;hed by fire<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Whi$locke, p. 434. 408.</NOTE>; and it became a &s;cience every where
much &s;tudied and cultivated, to di&s;tingui&s;h a true witch
by proper trials and &s;ymptoms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 396. 418.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE advance of the Engli&s;h army under Cromwel
was not able to appea&s;e or &s;often the animo&s;ities among
the Scots parties. The clergy were &s;till re&s;olute to ex|clude
all but their mo&s;t zealous adherents. So &s;oon as
the Engli&s;h parliament found that the treaty between
the King and the Scots would probably terminate in an
<PB N="194" REF="260">
accommodation, they made preparations for a war,
which, they &s;aw, would, in the end, prove inevitable.
Cromwel having now broke the force and courage of the
Iri&s;h, was &s;ent for; and he left the command of Ireland
to Ireton, who governed that kingdom in the character
of deputy, and with great vigilance and indu&s;try per&s;e|vered
in the work of &s;ubduing and expelling the na|tives.</P>
<P>IT was expected, that Fairfax, who &s;till retained the
name of General, would continue to act again&s;t Scot|land,
and appear at the head of the armies; a &s;tation for
which he was well qualified, and where alone he made
any figure. But Fairfax, though he had allowed the
army to make u&s;e of his name in murdering their &s;ove|reign,
and offering violence to the parliament, had enter|tained
un&s;urmountable &s;cruples again&s;t invading the Scots,
whom he con&s;idered as zealous pre&s;byterians, and u$$ted
to England by the &s;acred bands of the coven$$t. He
was farther di&s;gu&s;ted at the extremities into which he
had already been hurried; and was confirmed in his re|&s;olution
by the exhortations of his wife, who had great
influence over him, and was her&s;elf much governed by
the pre&s;byterian clergy. A committee of parliament
was &s;ent to rea&s;on with him; and Cromwel was one of
the number. In vain did they urge, that the Scots had
fir&s;t broke the covenant by their inva&s;ion of England
under Duke Hamilton; and that they would &s;urely re|new
their ho&s;tile attempts, if not prevented by the vi|gorous
mea&s;ures of the Commonwealth. Cromwel,
who knew the rigid inflexibility of Fairfax, in every
thing, which he regarded as matter of principle, ven|tured
to &s;olicit him with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s; and he
went &s;o far as to &s;hed tears of grief and vexation on this
occa&s;ion. No one could &s;u&s;pect any ambition in the
man, who laboured &s;o zealou&s;ly to retain his general in
that high office, which, he knew, he him&s;elf was alone
<PB N="195" REF="261">
entitled to fill. The &s;ame warmth of temper, which
made Cromwel a mo&s;t frantic enthu&s;ia&s;t, rendered him
the mo&s;t dangerous of hypocrites; and it was to this
turn of mind, as much as to his courage and capacity,
that he owed all his wonderful &s;ucce&s;&s;es. By the con|tagious
ferment of his zeal, he engaged every one to co|operate
with him in his mea&s;ures; and entering ea&s;ily
and affectionately into every part, which he was di&s;po&s;ed
to act, he was enabled, even after multiplied deceits, to
cover, under a tempe&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, all his crooked
&s;chemes and profound artifices.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX having re&s;igned his commi&s;&s;ion, it was be|&s;towed
on Cromwel, who was declared captain-general
of all the forces in England. This command, in a
Commonwealth, which &s;tood entirely by arms, was of
the utmo&s;t importance; and was the chief &s;tep, which
this ambitious politician had yet made towards &s;overeign
power. He immediately marched his forces, and entered
Scotland with an army of 16,000 men.</P>
<P>THE command of the Scots army was given to Le&s;ley,
a good officer, who formed a very proper plan for de|fence.
He entrenched him&s;elf in a fortified camp be|tween
Edinburgh and Leith, and took care to remove
from the counties of Mer&s;e and the Lothians every thing
which could &s;erve to &s;upport the Engli&s;h army. Crom|wel
advanced to the Scots camp, and endeavoured, by
every expedient, to bring Le&s;ley to a battle: The pru|dent
Scot&s;man knew, that, tho' &s;uperior in numbers, his
army was much inferior in di&s;cipline and experience to
the Engli&s;h; and he kept him&s;elf carefully within his
entrenchments. By &s;kirmi&s;hes and &s;mall rencounters he
tried to confirm the &s;pirits of his &s;oldiers; and he was
&s;ucce&s;sful in the&s;e enterprizes. His army encrea&s;ed daily
both in numbers and courage. The King came to the
camp; and having exerted him&s;elf in an action, gained
extremely on the affections of the &s;oldiery, who were
<PB N="196" REF="262">
more de&s;irous of &s;erving under a young prince of &s;pirit
and vivacity than under a committee of talking gown|men.
The clergy were alarmed. They ordered the
King immediately to leave the camp. They al&s;o purged
it carefully of about 4000 <HI>Malignants</HI> and <HI>Engagers,</HI> who&s;e
zeal had led them to attend the King, and who were the
&s;oldiers of chief credit and experience in the nation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed. Walker, p. 165.</NOTE>.
They then concluded, that they had an army compo&s;ed
entirely of &s;aints, and could not be beaten. They mur|mured
extremely, not only again&s;t their prudent general,
but al&s;o again&s;t the Lord, on account of his delays in
giving them deliverance<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">$span$ $$$d. p. 168</NOTE>; and they plainly told him,
that, if he would not &s;ave them from the Engli&s;h &s;ecta|ries,
he &s;hould no longer be their God<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke p. 449.</NOTE>. An advant|age
having offered it&s;elf on a Sunday, they hindred the
general from making u&s;e of it, le&s;t he &s;hould involve the
nation in the guilt of &s;abbath-breaking.</P>
<P>CROMWEL found him&s;elf in a very bad &s;ituation. He
had no provi&s;ions but what he received by &s;ea. He had
not had the precaution to bring the&s;e in &s;ufficient quan|tities;
and his army was reduced to difficulties. He re|tired
to Dunbar. Le&s;ley followed him and encamped on
the heights of Lammermure, which overlook that town.
There lay many difficult pa&s;&s;es between Dunbar and
Berwic, and of the&s;e Le&s;ley had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The
Engli&s;h general was brought to extremity. He had even
entertained a re&s;olution of &s;ending by &s;ea all his foot and
artillery to England, and of breaking thro', at all ha|zards,
with his cavalry. The madne&s;s of the Scots ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics
&s;aved him from this lo&s;s and di&s;honour.</P>
<P>NIGHT and day the mini&s;ters had been wre&s;tling with
the Lord in prayer, as they termed it; and they fancied,
that they had at la&s;t obtained the victory. Revelations,
they &s;aid, were made them, that the &s;ectarian and here|tical
<PB N="197" REF="263">
army, together with Agag, meaning Cromwel, was
delivered into their hands. Upon the faith of the&s;e vi|&s;ions,
they forced their general, in &s;pite of all his re|mon&s;trances,
to de&s;cend into the plain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Dunbar.</NOTE> with a view of
attacking the Engli&s;h in their retreat. Cromwel, look|ing
thro' a per&s;pective gla&s;s, &s;aw the Scots camp in mo|tion;
and foretold, without the help of revelations, that
the Lord had delivered his enemies into <HI>his</HI> hands. He
gave orders immediately for an attack.<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep|tember.</NOTE> In this battle it
was ea&s;ily ob&s;erved, that nothing, in militar actions,
can &s;upply the place of di&s;cipline and experience; and
that, in the pre&s;ence of real danger, where men are not
accu&s;tomed to it, the fumes of enthu&s;ia&s;m pre&s;ently di&s;|&s;ipate,
and lo&s;e their influence. The Scots, tho' doub$e
in number to the Engli&s;h, were &s;oon put to flight, and
pur&s;ued with great &s;laughter. The chief, if not only
re&s;i&s;tance was made by one regiment of Highlanders,
that part of the army which was the lea&s;t infected with
enthu&s;ia&s;m. No victory could be more compleat than this
obtained by Cromwel. About 3000 men were &s;lain
and 9000 taken pri&s;oners. Cromwel pur&s;ued his ad|vantage,
and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Edinburgh and Leith.
The remnants of the Scots army fled to Sterling. The
approach of the winter &s;ea&s;on, and an ague, which &s;eized
Cromwel, kept him from pu&s;hing the victory any far|ther.</P>
<P>THE clergy made great lamentations, and told the
Lord, that it was little to them to &s;acrifice their lives
and e&s;tates, but to him it was a great lo&s;s to &s;uffer his
elect and cho&s;en to be de&s;troyed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Walker.</NOTE>. They publi&s;hed a
declaration, containing the cau&s;e of their late misfor|tunes.
The&s;e vi&s;itations they afcribed to the manifold
provocations of the King's hou&s;e, of which, they feared,
he had not yet thoroughly repented; the &s;ecret intru|&s;ion
<PB N="198" REF="264">
of malignants into the King's family and even into
the camp; the leaving of a mo&s;t malignant and pro|fane
guard of hor&s;e, who, being &s;ent for to be purged,
came two days before the defeat, and were allowed to
fight in the army; the owning of the King's quarrel by
many without &s;ubordination to religion and liberty; and
the carnal &s;elf-&s;eeking of &s;ome, together with the neglect
of family prayers in others.</P>
<P>CROMWEL having been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the war of the
&s;word, took up the pen again&s;t the Scots eccle&s;ia&s;tics.
He wrote them &s;ome polemical letters, in which he main|tained
the chief points of the independent theology. He
took care likewi&s;e to retort on them their favorite argu|ment
of providence, and a&s;ked them whether the Lord had
not declared again&s;t them. But the mini&s;ters thought,
that the &s;ame events, which to their enemies were judge|ments,
to them were but trials; and they replied, that
the Lord had only hid his face, for a time, from Jacob.
But Cromwel in&s;i&s;ted, that the appeal had been made
to God in the mo&s;t expre&s;s and &s;olemn manner, and
that in the fields of Dunbar an irrevocable deci&s;ion had
been awarded in &s;avour of the Engli&s;h army<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">This is the be&s;t of Cromwel's wretched compo&s;itions that remain, and we &s;hall here extract a pa&s;&s;age out of it. &startq;You &s;ay you have not &s;o learned Chri&s;t as to hang the equity of your cau&s;e upon events. We could wi&s;h that blindne&s;s had not been upon your eyes to all tho&s;e marvellous di&s;pen|&s;ations, which God hath wrought lately in England. But did not you &s;o|lemnly appeal and pray? Did not we do &s;o too? And ought not we and you to think, with fear and trembling, of the hand of the great God, in this mighty and &s;trange appearance of his, but can &s;lightly call it an event?

THE defeat of the Scots was regarded by the King
as a very fortunate event.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651.</NOTE> The armies, which fought
on both &s;ides, were almo&s;t equally his enemies; and the
vanqui&s;hed were now obliged to give him &s;ome more
authority, and apply to him for &s;upport. The parlia|ment
was &s;ummoned to meet at St. John&s;tone. Hamil|ton,
Lauderdale, and all the Engagers were admitted into
court and camp, on condition of doing public pennance,
and expre&s;&s;ing repentance for their late tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.
Some Malignants al&s;o crept in under various pretences.
The intended humiliation or pennance of the King was
changed into the ceremony of his coronation, which
was performed at Scone with great pomp and &s;olemnity.
But amid&s;t all this appearance of re&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">I&s;t of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> Charles re|mained
in the hands of the mo&s;t rigid Covenanters:
and tho' treated with civility and courte&s;y by Argyle,
a man of parts and addre&s;s, he was little better than a
pri&s;oner, and was &s;till expo&s;ed to all the rudene&s;s and
pedantry of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics.</P>
<P>THIS young prince was in a &s;ituation, which very ill
&s;uited his temper and di&s;po&s;ition. All tho&s;e good qua|lities
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, his affability, his wit, his
gaiety, his gentlemanly, di&s;engaged behavior, were here
&s;o many vices; and his love of ea&s;e, liberty, and plea|&s;ure
was regarded as the highe&s;t enormity. Tho' art|ful
in the practice of courtly di&s;&s;imulation, the &s;ancti|fied
&s;tyle was utterly unknown to him; and he never
could mould his deportment into that &s;tarched grimace,
which the covenanters required as the infallible mark of
conver&s;ion. The duke of Buckingham was the only
Engli&s;h courtier allowed to attend him; and by his in|genious
talent of ridicule, he had rendered him&s;elf ex|tremely
<PB N="200" REF="266">
agreeable to his ma&s;ter. While &s;o many ob|jects
of deri&s;ion &s;urrounded them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1651.</NOTE> it was difficult to be
altogether in&s;en&s;ible to the temptation, and wholly to
&s;uppre&s;s the laugh. Obliged to attend from morning to
night at prayers and &s;ermons, they betrayed evident &s;ymp|toms
of wearine&s;s or contempt. The clergy never
could e&s;teem the King &s;ufficiently regenerated: And by
continued exhortations, remon&s;trances, and reprimands,
they &s;till endeavoured to bring him to a ju&s;ter &s;en&s;e of
his &s;piritual duty.</P>
<P>THE King's pa&s;&s;ion for the fair could not altogether
be re&s;trained. He had once been ob&s;erved u&s;ing &s;ome
familiarities with a young woman; and a committee of
mini&s;ters was appointed to reprove him for a behaviour
&s;o unbecoming a covenanted monarch. The &s;poke&s;man
of the committee, one Dougla&s;s, began with a &s;evere
a&s;pect, informed the King that great &s;candal had been
given to the godly, enlarged on the heinous nature of
&s;in, and concluded with exhorting his Maje&s;ty, when|ever
he was di&s;po&s;ed to amu&s;e him&s;elf, to be more care|ful,
for the future, in &s;hutting his windows. This
delicacy, &s;o unu&s;ual to the place and to the character of
the man, was remarked by the King; and he never for|got
the obligation.</P>
<P>THE King, &s;hocked with all the indignities, and per|haps,
&s;till more tired with all the formalities, to which
he was obliged to &s;ubmit, made an attempt to regain his
liberty. General Middleton, at the head of &s;ome roya|li&s;ts,
being pro&s;cribed by the Covenanters, kept in the
mountains, expecting &s;ome opportunity of &s;erving his
ma&s;ter. The King re&s;olved to join this body. He &s;e|cretly
made his e&s;cape from Argyle, and fled towards
the Highlands. Colonel Montgomery, with a troop of
hor&s;e, was &s;ent in pur&s;uit of him. He overtook the
King, and per&s;uaded him to return. The royali&s;ts be|ing
<PB N="201" REF="267">
too weak to &s;upport him, Charles was the more ea$$ly
induced to comply. This incident procured him after|wards
better treatment and more authority; the cove|nanters
being afraid of driving him by their rigours, to
&s;ome de&s;perate re&s;olution. Argyle renewed his court&s;hip
to the King, and the King, with equal diffimulation,
pretended to repo&s;e great confidence in Argyle. He even
went &s;o far as to drop hints of his intention to marry that
nobleman's daughter: But he had to do with a man too
wi&s;e to be &s;educed by &s;uch gro&s;s artifices.</P>
<P>SO &s;oon as the &s;ea&s;on would permit, the Scots army
was a&s;&s;embled under Hamilton and Le&s;ley; and the King
was allowed to join the camp. The forces of the we&s;tern
counties, notwith&s;tanding the imminent danger, which
threatened their country, were re&s;olved not to unite their
cau&s;e with that of an army, which admitted any engagers
or malignants among them; and they kept in a body
apart under Ker. They called them&s;elves the <HI>Protesters;</HI>
and their frantic clergy declaimed equally again&s;t the
King and Cromwel. The other party were denominated
<HI>Resolutioners;</HI> and the&s;e di&s;tinctions continued long after
to divide and agitate the kingdom.</P>
<P>CHARLES encamped at the Torwood; and his gene|rals
re&s;olved to conduct them&s;elves by the &s;ame cautious
maxims, which, &s;o long as they were embraced, had
been &s;ucce&s;sful during the former campaign. The town
of Stirling lay at his back, and the whole north &s;upplied
him with provi&s;ions. Strong entrenchments defended
his front; and it was in vain that Cromwel made every
attempt to bring him to an engagement. After lo&s;ing
much time, the Engli&s;h general &s;ent Lambert over the
f$rth into Fife, with an intention of cutting off the pro|vi&s;ions
of the Scots army. Lambert fell upon Holborne
and Brown, who commanded a party of the Scots, and
put them to rout with great &s;laughter. Cromwel al&s;o
<PB N="202" REF="268">
pa&s;&s;ed over with his whole army, and lying at the back
of the King, made it impo&s;&s;ible for him to keep his po&s;t
any longer.</P>
<P>CHARLES, reduced to de&s;pair, embraced a re&s;olution
worthy a young prince contending for empire. Having
the way open to England, he re&s;olved immediately to
march into that country, where he expected, that all
his friends, and all tho&s;e di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent
government would flock to his &s;tandard. He per&s;uaded
the generals to enter into the &s;ame views; and with one
con&s;ent the army, to the number of 14,000 men, ro&s;e
from their camp, and advanced by great journies towards
the &s;outh.</P>
<P>CROMWEL was &s;urprized at the movements of the
Scots army. Wholly intent on offending his enemy, he
had expo&s;ed his friends to the mo&s;t imminent danger,
and &s;aw the King with a large army marching into Eng|land,
where his pre&s;ence, from the general hatred, which
prevailed again&s;t the parliament, was capable of operat|ing
&s;ome great revolution. But if this conduct was an
over&s;ight in Cromwel, he quickly repaired it by his vigi|lance
and activity. He di&s;patched letters to the parlia|ment,
exhorting them not to be terrified at the approach
of the Scots: He &s;ent orders every where for a&s;&s;embling
forces to oppo&s;e the King: He ordered Lambert with a
body of cavalry to hang upon the rear of the royal
army, and infe&s;t their march: And he him&s;elf, leaving
Monk with 7000 men to compleat the reduction of
Scotland, followed the King with all the expedition po&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>CHARLES found him&s;elf di&s;appointed in his expecta|tions
of encrea&s;ing his army. The Scots, terrified at
the pro&s;pect of &s;o hazardous an enterprize, fell off in
great numbers. The Engli&s;h pre&s;byterians, having no
warning given them of the King's approach, were not
<PB N="203" REF="269">
prepared to join him. To the royali&s;ts, this mea&s;ure
was equally unexpected; and they were farther de|terred
from joining the Scots army by the orders which
the committee of mini&s;ters had i&s;&s;ued, not to admit any,
even in this de&s;perate extremity, who would not &s;ub|&s;cribe
the covenant. The earl of Derby, leaving the
i&s;le of Man, where he had hitherto maintained his inde|pendance
on the parliament, was employed in levying
forces in Che&s;hire and Lanca&s;hire; but was &s;oon &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed
by a party of the parliamentary army. And the
King, when he arrived at Worce&s;ter, found, that his
forces, extremely harra&s;&s;ed by a ha&s;ty and fatiguing
march, were not more numerous, than when he ro&s;e
from his camp in the Torwood.</P>
<P>SUCH is the influence of e&s;tabli&s;hed government, that
the Commonwealth, tho' founded in u&s;urpation the mo&s;t
unju&s;t and unpopular, had authority &s;ufficient to rai&s;e
every where the militia of the counties; and the&s;e, united
with the regular forces, bent all their efforts again&s;t the
King. With an army of above 40,000 men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep|tember.</NOTE> Cromwel
fell upon Worce&s;ter; and attacking it on all &s;ides, and
meeting with little re&s;i&s;tance except from Duke Hamilton
and general Middleton, broke in upon the di&s;ordered
royali&s;ts. The &s;treets of the city were &s;trowed with
the dead. Hamilton,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Worce&s;ter.</NOTE> a nobleman of great bravery and
honour, was mortally wounded; Ma&s;&s;ey wounded and
taken pri&s;oner; the King him&s;elf, having given many
proofs of per&s;onal valour, was obliged to fly. The whole
Scots army were either killed or taken pri&s;oners. The
country people, inflamed with national antipathy, inhu|manly
put to death the few who e&s;caped from the field of
battle.</P>
<P>THE King left Worce&s;ter at &s;ix o'clock in the after|noon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's e&s;cape.</NOTE>
and without halting, travelled about twenty-&s;ix
miles, in company with fifty or &s;ixty of his friends. To
provide for his &s;ecurity, he thought it be&s;t to &s;eparate

him&s;elf from his companions; and he left them without
communicating his intentions to any of them. By the
earl of Derby's directions, he went to Bo&s;cobel, a lone
hou&s;e in the borders of Stafford&s;hire, inhabited by one
Penderell, a farmer. To this man Charles entru&s;ted
him&s;elf. The man had dignity of &s;entiments much
above his condition; and tho' death was denounced
again&s;t all who concealed the King, and a great reward
promi&s;ed to any one who &s;hould betray him, he pro|fe&s;&s;ed
and maintained un&s;haken fidelity. He took the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his four brothers, equally honourable with
him&s;elf; and having cloathed the King in a garb like
their own, they led him into the neighbouring wood, put
a bill into his hand, and pretended to employ them&s;elves
in cutting faggots. Some nights he lay upon &s;traw in
the hou&s;e, and fed upon &s;uch homely fare as it afforded.
For a better concealment, he mounted upon an oak,
where he &s;heltered him&s;elf among the leaves and branches
for twenty-four hours. He &s;aw &s;everal &s;oldiers pa&s;s by.
All of them were intent in &s;earch of the King; and many
expre&s;&s;ed in his hearing their earne&s;t wi&s;hes of &s;eizing
him. This tree was afterwards denominated the <HI>Royal
Oak;</HI> and for many years was regarded by the whole
neighbourhood with great veneration.</P>
<P>CHARLES was in the middle of the kingdom, and
could neither &s;tay in his retreat, nor &s;tir a &s;tep from it,
without the mo&s;t imminent danger. Fears, hopes, and
party-zeal intere&s;ted multitudes to di&s;cover him; and
even the &s;malle&s;t indi&s;cretion of his friends might prove
fatal. Having joined lord Wilmot, who was &s;kulking
in the neighborhood, they agreed to put them&s;elves into
the hands of colonel Lane, a zealous royali&s;t, who
lived at Bentley, not many miles di&s;tant. The King's
feet were &s;o hurt by walking about in heavy boots or
countrymen's &s;hoes which did not fit him, that he was
obliged to mount on hor&s;eback; and he travelled in this
<PB N="205" REF="273">
&s;ituation to Bentley, attended by the five Penderells,
who had been &s;o faithful to him. Lane formed a &s;cheme
for his journey to Bri&s;tol, where, it was hoped, he would
find a &s;hip, in which he might tran&s;port him&s;elf. He
had a near kin&s;woman, Mrs. Norton, who lived within
three miles of that city, and was with child, very near
the time of her delivery. He obtained a pa&s;s (for dur|ing
tho&s;e times of confu&s;ion this precaution was requi|&s;ite)
for his &s;i&s;ter Jane Lane and a &s;ervant, to travel to|wards
Bri&s;tol, under pretence of vi&s;iting and attending
her relation. The King rode before the lady, and per|&s;onated
the &s;ervant: Wilmot, carrying a hawk on his
hand, pa&s;&s;ed for a &s;tranger, who had accidentally joined
them.</P>
<P>WHEN they arrived at Norton's, Mrs. Lane pretended,
that &s;he had brought along as her &s;ervant, a poor lad, a
neighbouring farmer's &s;on, who was ill of an ague; and
&s;he begged a private room for him, where he might be
quiet. Tho' Charles kept him&s;elf retired in this cham|ber,
the butler, one Pope, &s;oon knew him; and throw|ing
him&s;elf on his knees, prayed for his Maje&s;ty's life
and pre&s;ervation. The King was alarmed, but made
the butler promi&s;e that he would keep the &s;ecret from
every mortal, even from his ma&s;ter; and he was faithful
to his engagement.</P>
<P>NO &s;hip, it was found, would, for a month, &s;et &s;ail
from Bri&s;tol, either for France or Spain; and the King
was obliged to go el&s;ewhere for a pa&s;&s;age. He entru&s;ted
him&s;elf to colonel Windham of Dor&s;et&s;hire, an affec|tionate
partizan of the royal family. The natural effect
of the long civil wars and of the f$rious rage, to which
all men were wrought up in their different factions, was,
that every one's inclinations and affections were tho|roughly
known, and even the courage and fidelity of mo&s;t
men, by the variety of incidents, had been put to trial.
<PB N="206" REF="274">
The royali&s;ts too had, many of them, been obliged to
contrive concealments in their hou&s;es for them&s;elves,
their friends, or mo&s;t valuable effects; and the arts of
eluding the enemy had been often practi&s;ed. All the&s;e
circum&s;tances proved favourable to the King in the pre|&s;ent
exigency. As he pa&s;&s;ed often thro' the hands of
catholics, the <HI>Priest's hole,</HI> as they called it, the place,
where they were obliged to conceal their per&s;ecuted
prie&s;ts, was &s;ometimes employed for &s;heltering their di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
Sovereign.</P>
<P>WINDHAM, before he received the King, a&s;ked leave
to entru&s;t the important &s;ecret to his mother, his wife,
and four &s;ervants, on who&s;e fidelity he could entirely de|pend.
Of all the&s;e per&s;ons, no one proved wanting
either in honour or di&s;cretion. The venerable old ma|tron,
on the reception of her royal gue&s;t, expre&s;&s;ed the
utmo&s;t joy, that, having lo&s;t, without regret, three &s;ons
and one grand-child in defence of his father, &s;he was
now re&s;erved, in her declining years, to be in&s;trumental
in the pre&s;ervation of him&s;elf. Windham told the King,
that Sir Thomas, his father, in the year 1636, a few
days before his death, called to him his five &s;ons. &startq;My
children,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;we have hitherto &s;een &s;erene
and quiet times under our three la&s;t &s;overeigns: But
I mu&s;t now warn you to prepare for clouds and
&s;torms. Factions ari&s;e on every &s;ide and threaten the
tranquillity of your native country. But whatever
happen, do you faithfully honour and obey your Prince,
and adhere to the Crown. I charge you never to for|&s;ake
the Crown, tho' it &s;hould hang upon a bu&s;h.&endq;
&startq;The&s;e la&s;t words,&endq; added Windham, &startq;made &s;uch
impre&s;&s;ions on all our brea&s;ts, that the many af|flictions
of the&s;e &s;ad times could never efface their in|delible
characters.&endq; From innumerable in&s;tances it
appears how deep rooted in the minds of the Engli&s;h
gentry of that age was the principle of loyalty to their
<PB N="207" REF="275">
Sovereign; that noble and generous principle, inferior
only in excellence to the more enlarged and more in|lightened
affection towards a legal con&s;titution. But
during tho&s;e times of military u&s;urpation, the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
were the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE King continued nineteen days in Windham's
hou&s;e; and all his friends in Britain and in every part
of Europe, remained in the mo&s;t anxious &s;u&s;pence with
regard to his fortune: No one could conjecture whether
he was dead or alive; and the report of his death, being
generally believed, happily relaxed the vigilant &s;earch of
his enemies. Trials were made to procure a ve&s;&s;el for
his e&s;cape; but he &s;till met with di&s;appointments.
Having left Windham's hou&s;e, he was obliged again to
return to it. He pa&s;&s;ed thro' many other adventures;
a&s;&s;umed different di&s;gui&s;es; in every &s;tep was expo&s;ed to
imminent perils; and received daily proofs of uncor|rupted
fidelity and attachment. The &s;agacity of a &s;mith,
who remarked, that his hor&s;e's &s;hoes had been made in
the north, not in the we&s;t, as he pretended, once de|tected
him; and he narrowly e&s;caped. At Shoreham in
Su&s;&s;ex a ve&s;&s;el was at la&s;t found, in which he embarked.
He had been known to &s;o many, that, if he had not &s;et
&s;ail in that critical moment, it had been impo&s;&s;ible for
him to e&s;cape. After one and forty days concealment,
he arrived &s;afely at Fe&s;champ in Normandy. No le$s
than forty men and women had at different times been
pri$y to his e&s;cape<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Heathe's Chronicle, p. 301.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE battle of Worce&s;ter afforded Cromwel what he
called his <HI>crowning mercy.</HI> So elated was he, that he in|tended
to have knighted in the field two of his generals,
Lambert and Fleetwood; but was di&s;&s;waded by his
friends from exerting this act of regal authority. His
power and ambition were too great to brook &s;ubjection
<PB N="208" REF="276">
to the empty name of a republic, which &s;tood chiefly by
his influence and was &s;upported by his victories. How
early he entertained thoughts of taking into his hand the
reins of government is uncertain. We are only a&s;&s;ured,
that he now di&s;covered to his intimate friends the&s;e
a&s;piring views; and even expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of a&s;&s;uming
the rank of King, which he had contributed, with &s;uch
&s;eeming zeal, to aboli&s;h<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 523.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE little popularity and credit,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Com|monwealth.</NOTE> acquired by the re|publicans,
farther &s;timulated the ambition of this enter|prizing
politician. The&s;e men had not that large
thought, nor tho&s;e comprehen&s;ive views, which might
qualify them for acting the part of legi&s;lators: Selfi&s;h
aims and bigotry chiefly engro&s;&s;ed their attention. They
carried their rigid au&s;terity &s;o far as to enact laws, de|claring
fornication, after the fir&s;t act, to be felony, with|out
benefit of clergy<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Scobel, p. 121.</NOTE>. They made &s;mall progre&s;s in
that important work, which they profe&s;&s;ed to have &s;o
much at heart, the &s;ettling a new model of repre&s;enta|tion,
and fixing a plan of government. The nation be|gan
to apprehend, that they intended to e&s;tabli&s;h them|&s;elves
as a perpetual legi&s;lature, and to confine the whole
power to 60 or 70 per&s;ons, who called them&s;elves the
parliament of the Commonwealth of England. And
while they pretended to be&s;tow new liberties upon the
nation, they found them&s;elves obliged to infringe even
the mo&s;t valuable of tho&s;e, which, thro' time immemo|rial,
had been tran&s;mitted from their ance&s;tors. Not
daring to entru&s;t the trials of trea&s;on to juries, who, be|ing
cho&s;en indifferently from among the people, would
have been little favourable to the Commonwealth, and
would have formed their verdict upon the antient laws,
they eluded that noble in&s;titution, by which the govern|ment
of this i&s;land has ever been &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed.
<PB N="209" REF="277">
They had &s;een evidently in the trial of Lilburn what
they could expect from juries. This man, the mo&s;t
turbulent, but the mo&s;t upright and courageous of hu|mankind,
was tried for a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the new &s;ta|tute
of trea&s;ons: But tho' he was plainly guilty, he was
acquitted, to the infinite joy of the people. We&s;tmin|&s;ter-hall,
nay the whole city, rang with &s;houts and ac|clamations.
Never did any e&s;tabli&s;hed power receive &s;o
&s;trong a declaration of its u&s;urpation and invalidity;
and from no other in&s;titution, be&s;ides the admirable one
of juries, could be expected this magnanimous effort.</P>
<P>THAT they might not for the future be expo&s;ed to
affronts, which &s;o much le&s;&s;ened their authority, the
parliament erected a high court of ju&s;tice, who were to
receive indictments from the council of &s;tate. This
court was compo&s;ed entirely of men, devoted to the
ruling party, without name or character, determin|ed
to &s;acrifice every thing to their own &s;afety or ambi|tion.
Colonel Eu&s;ebius Andrews, and colonel Walter
Sling&s;by were tried by this court for con&s;piracies, and
condemned to death. They were royali&s;ts, and refu&s;ed
to plead before &s;o illegal a juri&s;diction. Love, Gib|bons,
and other pre&s;byterians, $having entered into a
plot again&s;t the republic, were al&s;o tried and executed.
The Earl of Derby, Sir Timothy Fether&s;tone, Bemboe,
being taken pri&s;oners after the battle of Worce&s;ter, were
put to death by &s;entence of a court martial: A method
of proceeding declared unlawful by that very petition of
right, for which a former parliament had &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly
contended, and which, after great efforts, they had ex|torted
from the King.</P>
<P>EXCEPTING their principles of toleration, the maxims,
by which the republicans regulated eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs,
no more progno&s;ticated any durable &s;ettlement, than
tho&s;e by which they conducted their civil concerns. The

was not allowed to be fini&s;hed: It &s;eemed even
the intention of many leaders in the parliament to admit
of no e&s;tabli&s;hed church, and to leave every one, with|out
any guidance of the magi&s;trate, to embrace what|ever
&s;ect and to &s;upport whatever clergy were mo&s;t
agreeable to him. It was not perceived, that by this
policy the enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;pirit mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity, from a
concurrence of the emulation and intere&s;ted views of the
eccle&s;ia&s;tics, be rai&s;ed to &s;uch a height as to elude all the
tyes of civil and moral duty.</P>
<P>THE parliament went &s;o far as to make &s;ome ap|proaches,
in one province, to their independant model.
Almo&s;t all the clergy of Wales being ejected as malig|nants,
itinerant preachers with a &s;mall &s;alary were &s;et|tled,
not above four or five in each county; and the&s;e,
being furni&s;hed with hor&s;es at the public charge, hur|ried
from place to place, and carried, as they expre&s;&s;ed
them&s;elves, the glad tidings of the go&s;pel<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Dr. John Walker's attempt, p. 147, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. They were
all of them men of the lowe&s;t birth and education, who
had de&s;erted mechanical trades, in order to follow this
new profe&s;&s;ion: And in this particular, as well as in
their wandering life, they pretended to be more truly
apo&s;tolical.</P>
<P>THE republicans, both by the turn of their di&s;po&s;ition,
and by the nature of the in&s;truments, which they em|ployed,
were better qualified for acts of force and vi|gour
than for the &s;low and deliberate work of legi&s;lation.
Notwith&s;tanding the late wars and blood&s;hed and the
pre&s;ent factions, the power of England had never, in
any period, been &s;o formidable to the neighbouring
kingdoms as at this time it appeared in the hands of the
Commonwealth. A numerous army &s;erved equally to
retain every one, in implicit &s;ubjection to e&s;tabli&s;hed au|thority,
and to &s;trike a terror into foreign nations. The
<PB N="211" REF="281">
power of peace and war was lodged in the &s;ame hands
with that of impo&s;ing taxes; and no difference of views,
among the &s;everal members of the legi&s;lature, could any
longer be apprehended. The pre&s;ent impo&s;itions, tho'
much &s;uperior to what had ever formerly been expe|rienced,
were in reality very moderate, and what a na|tion,
&s;o opulent, could ea&s;ily bear. The military ge|nius
of the people, by the civil conte&s;ts, had been
rouzed from its former lethargy; and excellent officers
were formed in every branch of &s;ervice. The confu|&s;ion,
into which all things had been thrown, had given
opportunity to men of low &s;tations to break thro' their
ob&s;curity, and to rai&s;e them&s;elves by their courage to
commands, which they were well qualified to exerci&s;e,
but to which their birth could never have entitled them.
And while &s;o great power was lodged in &s;uch active
hands, no wonder the republic was &s;ucce&s;sful in all its
enterprizes.</P>
<P>BLAKE, a man of heroic courage and a generous di&s;|po&s;ition,
the &s;ame per&s;on who had defended Lyme and
Taunton with &s;uch un&s;haken ob&s;tinacy again&s;t the King,
was made an admiral; and tho' he had hitherto been ac|cu&s;tomed
only to land &s;ervice, into which too he had
not entered till pa&s;t fifty years of age, he &s;oon rai&s;ed
the naval glory of the nation to a higher pitch than it
had ever attained in any former period. A fleet was
committed to him, and he received orders to pur&s;ue
Prince Rupert, to whom the King had given the com|mand
of that &s;quadron, which had de&s;erted to him.
Rupert took &s;helter in Kin&s;ale; and e&s;caping thence,
fled towards the coa&s;t of Portugal. Blake pur&s;ued, and
chaced him into the Tagus, where he intended to at|tack
that Prince. But the King of Portugal, moved by
the favour, which, throughout all Europe, attended the
royal cau&s;e, refu&s;ed Blake admittance, and aided Prince
Rupert in making his e&s;cape. To be revenged of this
<PB N="212" REF="282">
partiality, the Engli&s;h admiral made prize of twenty
Portugue&s;e &s;hips richly laden, and threatened &s;till far|ther
vengeance. The King of Portugal, dreading &s;o
dangerous a foe to his new acquired dominion, and
&s;en&s;ible of the unequal conte&s;t, in which he was en|gaged,
made all po&s;&s;ible &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the haughty re|public,
and was at la&s;t admitted to negotiate the renewal
of his alliance with England. Prince Rupert, having
lo&s;t a great part of his &s;quadron on the coa&s;t of Spain,
made &s;ail towards the We&s;t-Indies. His brother, Prince
Maurice, was there &s;hip-wrecked in a hurricane. Every
where, this &s;quadron &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by privateering, &s;ome|times
on Engli&s;h, &s;ometimes on Spani&s;h ve&s;&s;els. And
Rupert at la&s;t returned to France, where he di&s;po&s;ed of
the remnants of his fleet, together with all his prizes.</P>
<P>ALL the &s;ettlements in America, except New Eng|land,
which had been planted entirely by the puritans,
adhered to the royal party, even after the &s;ettlement of
the republic; and Sir George Ay&s;cue was &s;ent with a
&s;quadron to reduce them to obedience. Bermudas, An|tigua,
Virginia were &s;oon &s;ubdued. Barbadoes, com|manded
by Lord Willoughby of Parham, made &s;ome
re&s;i&s;tance; but was at la&s;t obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>WITH equal ea&s;e were Jer&s;ey, Guern&s;ey, Scilly, and
the I&s;le of Man brought under &s;ubjection to the repub|lic;
and the &s;ea, which had been much infe&s;ted by pri|vateers
from the&s;e i&s;lands, was rendered entirely &s;afe to
the Engli&s;h commerce. The Counte&s;s of Derby de|fended
the I&s;le of Man; and with great reluctance yielded
to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering to the enemy. This
lady, a daughter of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Trimo$uUille
in France, had, during the civil wars, di&s;played a manly
courage by her ob&s;tinate defence of Latham-Hou&s;e again&s;t
the parliamentary forces; and &s;he retained the glory of be|ing

<P>IRELAND and Scotland were now entirely &s;ubjected

Ireland, commanding a numerous army of 30,000 men
pro&s;ecuted the work of &s;ubduing the revolted Iri&s;h;
and he defeated them in many rencounters, which,
tho' in them&s;elves of no great moment, proved fatal to
their declining cau&s;e. He puni&s;hed without mercy all
the pri&s;oners who had any hand in the ma&s;&s;acres. Sir

brought to the gibbet, and &s;uffered an ignomi|nious
death, which he had &s;o well merited by his inhu|man

indu&s;try, capacity, even for the &s;trict execution of ju&s;tice

never could have been induced, by any motive, to &s;ub|mit
to the &s;malle&s;t appearance of regal government.
Cromwel appeared to be much affected by his death;
and the Republicans, who repo&s;ed great confidence in
him, were incon&s;oleable. To &s;how their regard for his
merit and &s;ervices, they be&s;towed an e&s;tate of two thou|&s;and
pounds a year on his family, and honoured him
with a magnificent funeral at the public charge. Tho'
the e&s;tabli&s;hed government was but the mere &s;hadow of
a Commonwealth, yet was it beginning by proper arts
to encourage that public &s;pirit, which no other &s;pecies
of civil polity is ever able fully to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>THE command of the army in Ireland devolved on
lieutenant-general Ludlow. The civil government of
the i&s;land was entru&s;ted to commi&s;&s;ioners. Ludlow con|tinued
to pu&s;h the advantages again&s;t the Iri&s;h, and
every where obtained an ea&s;y victory. That unhappy
people, di&s;gu&s;ted with the King on account of tho&s;e
violent declarations again&s;t them and their religion,
which had been extorted by the Scots, applied to the
King of Spain, to the Duke of Lorraine; and found
a&s;&s;i&s;tance no where. Clanricarde, unable to re&s;i&s;t the
prevailing power, made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the parliament,
and retired into England, where he &s;oon after died. He
was a &s;teady catholic; but a man much re&s;pected by all
parties.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which attended Monk in Scotland,
were no le&s;s deci&s;ive. That able general laid &s;iege to
Stirling ca&s;tle; and though it was well provided for de|fence,
it was &s;oon &s;urrendered to him. He there be|came
ma&s;ter of all the records of the kingdom; and he
&s;ent them to England. The Earl of Leven, the Earl
of Crawford, Lord Ogilvy, and other noblemen, hav|ing
met near Perth, in order to concert means for rai&s;|ing
a new army, were &s;uddenly &s;et upon by Colonel
<PB N="215" REF="287">
Alured, and mo&s;t of them taken pri&s;oners. Sir Philip
Mu&s;grave, with &s;ome Scots, being engaged at Dumfries
in a like enterprize, met with the &s;ame fate. Dundee
was a town well fortified, &s;upplied with a good garri&s;on
under Lumi&s;den, and full of all the rich furniture, the
plate and money of the kingdom, which had been &s;ent
thither as to a place of &s;afety. Monk appeared before
it; and having made a breach, gave a general a&s;&s;ault.
He carried the town; and following the example and
in&s;tructions of Cromwel, put the whole inhabitants to
the &s;word, in order to &s;trike a general terror into the
kingdom. Warned by this example, Aberdeen, St. An|drews,
Inverne&s;s, and other towns and forts, of their
own accord, yielded to the enemy. Argyle made his
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Engli&s;h Commonwealth; and except|ing
a few royali&s;ts, who remained &s;ome time in the
mountains, under the Earl of Glencairn, Lord Balcar|ras,
and General Middleton, that kingdom, which had
hitherto, through all ages, by means of its &s;ituation, po|verty,
and valour, maintained its independance, was re|duced
to a total &s;ubjection.</P>

men, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little of the real &s;pirit of liberty,
knew how to maintain all the appearances of it; and
they required the voluntary con&s;ent of all the counties
and towns of this conquered kingdom, before they would
unite them into the &s;ame Commonwealth with England.

with the pre&s;ent government<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">It had been an u&s;ual policy of the pre&s;byterian eccle&s;ia&s;tics to &s;ettle a chaplain in the great families, who acted as a &s;py upon his ma&s;ter, and gave them intelligence of the mo&s;t private tran&s;actions and di&s;cour&s;es of the family. A &s;ignal in&s;tance of prie&s;tly tyranny, and the &s;ubjection of the nobility! They even obliged the &s;ervants to give intelligence again&s;t their ma&s;ters. Whitlocke, p. 502. The &s;ame author, p. 512. tells the following &s;tory. The &s;ynod meeting at Perth, and citing the mini&s;ters and people, who had expre&s;&s;ed a di&s;like of <HI>t$eir beavenly government,</HI> the men being out of the way, their wives re&s;olved to an&s;wer for them. And on the day of appearance, 120 wo|men with good clubs in their hands came and be&s;ieged the church, where the reverend mini&s;ters fat. They &s;ent one of their number to treat with the fe|males, and he threatening excommunication, they ba&s;ted him for his labour, kept him pri&s;oner, and &s;ent a party of 60, who routed the re&s;t of the clergy, brui&s;ed their bodies &s;orely, took all their baggage and 12 hor&s;es. One of the mini&s;ters, after a mile's-running, taking all creatures for his foes, meeting with a &s;oldier fell on his knees, who knowing nothing of the matter a&s;ked the blackcoat what he meant. The female eonquerors, having laid hold on the &s;ynod clerk, beat him till he for&s;wore his office. Thirteen mini&s;ters rallied about four miles from the place, and voted that this village &s;hould never mor&ecirc; have a &s;ynod in it, but be accur&s;ed; and that though in the years 1638 and 39, the godly women were cried up for &s;toning the bi&s;hops, yet now the whole &s;ex &s;hould be e&s;teemed wicked.</NOTE>. The prudent conduct
of Monk, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a good capacity for the
arts both of peace and war, &s;erved much to reconcile the
minds of men, and to allay their prejudices.</P>
<P>By the total reduction and pacification of the Briti&s;h.
dominions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dutch war.</NOTE> the parliament had lei&s;ure to look abroad,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1652.</NOTE>
and to exert their vigour in foreign enterprizes. The
Dutch were the fir&s;t who felt the weight of their arms.</P>
<P>DURING the life of Frederic Hnery, Prince of Orange,
the &s;tates had maintained an exact neutrality in the civil
wars of England, and had never interpo&s;ed, except by
their good offices, between the contending parties. When
William, who had married an Engli&s;h prince&s;s, &s;uc|ceeded
to his father's commands and authority, the
States, both before and after the execution of the late
King, were accu&s;ed of taking &s;teps more favourable to
<PB N="217" REF="289">
the royal cau&s;e, and of betraying a great prejudice again&s;t
the cau&s;e of the parliament. It was long before the en|voy
of the Engli&s;h Commonwealth could obtain an au|dience
of the States General. The murderers of Do|ri&s;laus
were not pur&s;ued with &s;uch vigour as the parlia|ment
expected. And much regard had been payed the
King, and many good offices performed to him, both
by the public, and by men of all ranks, in the United
Provinces.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of William, Prince of Orange<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In October 17, 1650.</NOTE>,
which was attended with the depre&s;&s;ion of his party and
the triumph of the Republicans, the parliament thought,
that the time was now come of cementing a clo&s;er con|federacy
with the United Provinces. St. John, Lord
Chief Ju&s;tice, who was &s;ent over to the Hague, had
entertained the idea of forming a kind of coalition be|tween
the two Republics, which would have rendered
their intere&s;ts totally in&s;eparable; but fearing that &s;o
extraordinary a project would not be reli&s;hed, he con|tented
him&s;elf with dropping &s;ome hints of it, and openly
went no farther than to propo&s;e a &s;trict defen&s;ive al|liance
between England and the States, &s;uch as has now,
for near &s;eventy years, taken place between the&s;e
friendly powers<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. $82.</NOTE>. But the States, who were unwilling
to form a nearer confederacy with a government,
who&s;e mea&s;ures were &s;o obnoxious, and who&s;e &s;ituation
&s;eemed &s;o precarious, offered only to renew the former
alliances with England. And the haughty St. John, di&s;|gu&s;ted
with this refu&s;al, as well as incen&s;ed at many af|fronts,
which had been offered him with impunity, by
the retainers of the Palatine and Orange families, and
indeed by the populace in general, returned into Eng|land,
and endeavoured to excite a quarrel between the
two republics.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="290">
THE movements of great &s;tates are often directed by
as &s;lender &s;prings as tho&s;e of individuals. Though war
with &s;o con&s;iderable a naval power as the Dutch, who
were in peace with all their other neighbours, might &s;eem
dangerous to the yet un&s;ettled Commonwealth, there
were &s;everal motives, which at this time induced the
Engli&s;h parliament to embrace ho&s;tile mea&s;ures. Many
of the members thought, that a foreign war would &s;erve
as a pretence for continuing the &s;ame parliament, and de|laying
the new model of a repre&s;entative, with which the
nation had &s;o long been flattered. Others hoped, that the
war would furni&s;h a rea&s;on for maintaining, &s;ome time
longer, that numerous mercenary army, which was &s;o
much complained of<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">We are told in the life of Sir Harry Vane, that that famous Republican oppo&s;ed the Dutch war, and that it was the military gentlemen chiefly who &s;upported that mea&s;ure.</NOTE>. On the other hand, &s;ome, who
dreaded the encrea&s;ing power of Cromwel, expected,
that the great expence of naval armaments would prove
a motive for dimini&s;hing the military e&s;tabli&s;hment. To
divert the attention of the public from dome&s;tic quarrels
towards foreign tran&s;actions, &s;eemed in the pre&s;ent di&s;|po&s;ition
of men's minds to be good policy. The &s;upe|rior
power of the Engli&s;h Commonwealth, together
with the advantages of &s;ituation, promi&s;ed it &s;ucce&s;s;
and the parliamentary leaders hoped to gain many rich
prizes from the Dutch, to di&s;tre&s;s and &s;ink their flouri&s;h|ing
commerce, and by victories to throw a lu&s;tre on
their e&s;tabli&s;hment, which was &s;o new and unpopular.
All the&s;e views, enforced by the violent &s;pirit of St.
John, who had a great influence over Cromwel, deter|mined
the parliament to change the propo&s;ed alliance
into a furious war again&s;t the United Provinces.</P>
<P>TO cover the&s;e ho&s;tile intentions, the parliament,
under pretence of providing for the intere&s;ts of com|merce,
embraced &s;uch mea&s;ures as, they knew, would
<PB N="219" REF="291">
give di&s;gu&s;t to the States. They framed the famous act
of navigation; which prohibited all nations to import
into England in their bottoms any commodity, which
was not the growth and manufacture of their own coun|try.
By this law, though the terms, in which it was
conceived, were general, the Dutch were principally
hurt; becau&s;e their country produces few commodities,
and they &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by being the general carriers and
factors of the world. Letters of reprizal were granted
to &s;everal merchants, who complained of injuries, which,
as they pretended, they had received from the States;
and above eighty Dutch &s;hips fell into their hands, and
were made prize of. The cruelties practi&s;ed on the
Engli&s;h at Amboyna, which were certainly enormous,
but which &s;eemed to be buried in oblivion by a thirty
years &s;ilence, were again made the grounds of com|plaint.
And the allowing the murderers of Dori&s;laus to
e&s;cape, and the conniving at the in&s;ults to which St.
John had been expo&s;ed, were represented as &s;ymptoms
of an unfriendly, if not a ho&s;tile, di&s;po&s;ition in the
States.</P>
<P>THE States, alarmed at all the&s;e &s;teps, &s;ent over or|ders
to their amba&s;&s;adors to endeavour the renewal of
the treaty of alliance, which had been broke off by the
abrupt departure of St. John. Not to be unprepared,
they equipped a fleet of a hundred and fifty fail, and
took care, by their mini&s;ters at London, to inform the
council of &s;tate of that armament. This intelligence,
in&s;tead of &s;triking terror into the Engli&s;h republic, was
con&s;idered as a menace, and farther confirmed the par|liament
in their ho&s;tile re&s;olutions. The minds of men,
in both &s;tates, were every day more and more irritated
again&s;t each other; and it was not long before the&s;e
malignant humours broke forth into action.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="292">
TROMP, an admiral of great renown, received from
the States the command of a fleet of forty-two &s;ail, in
order to protect the Dutch navigation again&s;t the priva|teers
of the Engli&s;h. He was forced by &s;tre&s;s of wea|ther,
as he alledged, to take &s;helter in the road of
Dover, where he met with Blake, who commanded an
Engli&s;h fleet much inferior in number. Who was the
aggre&s;&s;or in the action, which en&s;ued between the&s;e two
admirals, both of them men of &s;uch prompt and fiery
di&s;po&s;itions, it is not ea&s;y to determine; &s;ince each of
them &s;ent to his own &s;tate a relation totally oppo&s;ite in
all its circum&s;tances to that of the other, and yet &s;up|ported
by the te&s;timony of every captain in his fleet.
Blake pretended, that, having given a &s;ignal to the
Dutch admiral to &s;trike, Tromp, in&s;tead of complying,
fired a broad-&s;ide at him. Tromp a&s;&s;erted, that he was
preparing to &s;trike, and that the Engli&s;h admiral, never|thele&s;s,
began ho&s;tilities. It is certain, that the admi|ralty
of Holland, who are di&s;tinct from the council of
&s;tate, had given Tromp no orders to &s;trike, but had le&s;t
him to his own di&s;cretion with regard to that vain, but
much conte&s;ted ceremonial. They &s;eemed willing to
introduce the claim of an equality with the new Com|monwealth,
and to interpret the former re&s;pect, which
they had ever payed the Engli&s;h flag, as a deference due
only to the Monarchy. This circum&s;tance forms a
&s;trong pre&s;umption again&s;t the narrative of the Dutch
admiral. The whole Orange party, it mu&s;t be remark|ed,
to which Tromp was &s;u&s;pected to adhere, were de|firous
of a war with England.</P>
<P>BLAKE, though his &s;quadron con&s;i&s;ted only of fifteen
ve&s;&s;els, re-inforced, after the battle began, by eight un|der
captain Bourne, maintained the fight with great
bravery for five hours, and &s;unk one &s;hip of the enemy,
and took another. Night parted the combatants, and
the Dutch fleet retired towards the coa&s;t of Holland.
<PB N="221" REF="293">
The populace of London were enraged, and would have
in&s;ulted the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors, who lived at Chel&s;ea,
had not the council of &s;tate &s;ent guards to protect
them.</P>
<P>WHEN the States heard of this action, of which the
fatal con&s;equences were ea&s;ily fore&s;een, they were in the
utmo&s;t con&s;ternation. They immediately di&s;patched Paw,
pen&s;ionary of Holland, as their amba&s;&s;ador extraordinary
to London, and ordered him to lay before the parliament
the narrative which Tromp had &s;ent of the late rencoun|ter.
They entreated them, by all the bands of their
common religion, and common liberties, not to preci|pitate
them&s;elves into ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, but to appoint
commi&s;&s;ioners, who &s;hould examine every circum&s;tance
of the action, and clear up the truth, which lay in ob|&s;curity.
And they pretended, that they had given no
orders to their admiral to offer any violence to the Eng|li&s;h,
but would &s;everely puni&s;h him, if they found upon
enquiry, that he had been guilty of an action, which
they &s;o much di&s;approved. The imperious parliament
would hearken to none of the&s;e rea&s;ons or remon&s;trances.
Elated with the numerous &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which they had ob|tained
over their dome&s;tic enemies, they thought, that
every thing mu&s;t yiel$ to their fortunate arms; and they
gladly &s;eized the opportunity, which they &s;ought, of
making war upon the States. They demanded, that,
without any farther delay or enquiry, reparation &s;hould
be made for all the damages, which the Engli&s;h had &s;u&s;|tained.
And when this demand was not complied
with, they di&s;patched orders for commencing war again&s;t
the United Provinces.</P>
<P>BLAKE &s;ailed northwards with a numerous fleet, and
fell upon the herring bu&s;hes, which were e&s;corted by
twelve men of war. All the&s;e he either took or di&s;|per&s;ed.
Tromp followed him with a fleet of above a hun|dred
&s;ail. When the&s;e two admirals were within &s;ight
<PB N="222" REF="294">
of each other, and preparing for battle, a furious &s;torm
attacked them. Blake took &s;helter in the Engli&s;h har|bours.
The Dutch fleet was di&s;per&s;ed and received
great damage.</P>
<P>SIR GEORGE AYSCUE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> though he commanded only
forty &s;hips according to the Engli&s;h accounts, engaged
near Plymouth the famous de Ruiter, who had under him
fifty &s;hips of war, with thirty merchant-men. The
Dutch &s;hips were indeed of inferior force to the Eng|li&s;h.
De Ruiter, the only admiral in Europe, who has
attained a renown equal to that of the greate&s;t general,
defended him&s;elf &s;o well, that Ay&s;cue gained no advan|tage
over him. Night parted them in the greate&s;t heat
of the action. De Ruiter next day &s;ailed off with his
convoy. The Engli&s;h had been &s;o &s;hattered in the fight,
that they were not able to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>NEAR the coa&s;t of Kent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> Blake, &s;econded by Bourne
and Pen, met the Dutch fleet; nearly equal in number,
commanded by de Witte and de Ruiter. A battle was
fought much to the di&s;advantage of the Dutch. Their
rear-admiral was boarded and taken. Two other ve&s;&s;els
were &s;unk, and one blown up. The Dutch fleet next
day made &s;ail towards Holland.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h were not &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful in the Mediterra|nean.
Van Galen with much &s;uperior force attacked
captain Badily, and defeated him. He bought, how|ever,
his victory with the lo&s;s of his life.</P>
<P>SEA-FIGHTS are &s;eldom &s;o deci&s;ive as to di&s;able the<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of No|vember.</NOTE>
vanqui&s;hed from making head in a little time again&s;t the
victors. Tromp, &s;econded by de Ruiter, met near the
Goodwins, with Blake, who&s;e fleet was inferior to the
Dutch, but who was re&s;olved not to decline the com|bat.
A furious battle commenced, where the admirals
on both &s;ides, as well as the inferior officers and &s;ea|men,
exerted extraordinary bravery. In this action,
<PB N="223" REF="295">
the Dutch had the advantage. Blake him&s;elf was
wounded. The Garland and Bonaventure were taken.
Two &s;hips were burned, and one &s;unk; and night came
very opportunely to &s;ave the Engli&s;h fleet. After this
victory, Tromp in a bravado fixed a broom to his main|ma&s;t;
as if he were re&s;olved to &s;weep the &s;ea entirely of
all Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>GREAT preparations were made in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> in order
to wipe off this di&s;grace. A gallant fleet of eighty &s;ail
was fitted out. Blake commanded, and Dean under
him, together with Monk, who had been &s;ent for from
Scotland. When the Engli&s;h lay off Portland, they
de&s;cried near break of day the Dutch fleet of &s;eventy-&s;ix<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE>
ve&s;&s;els, &s;ailing up the channel, along with a convoy of
300 merchant-men, who had received orders to wait at
the i&s;le of Rh$eA, till the fleet &s;hould arrive to e&s;corte
them. Tromp and de Ruiter commanded the Dutch.
This battle was the mo&s;t furious which had yet been
fought, between the&s;e warlike and rival nations. Three
days was the battle continued with the utmo&s;t rage and
ob&s;tinacy: and Blake, who was victor, gained not more
honour than Tromp, who was vanqui&s;hed. The Dutch
admiral made a &s;kilful retreat, and &s;aved all the mer|chant
&s;hips, except thirty. He lo&s;t however eleven
&s;hips of war, had 2000 men &s;lain, and near 1500 taken
pri&s;oners. The Engli&s;h, though many of their &s;hips
were extremely &s;hattered, had but one &s;unk. Their &s;lain
were not much inferior in number to tho&s;e of the ene|my.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the Engli&s;h were chiefly owing
to the &s;uperior &s;ize of their ve&s;&s;els; an advantage which
all the &s;kill and bravery of the Dutch admirals could not
compen&s;ate By means of &s;hip-money, an impo&s;ition,
which had been &s;o much complained of, and in &s;ome re|&s;pects

a &s;ituation, which it had never attain$d in any former
reign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1653.</NOTE> and he ventured to build &s;hips of a &s;ize, which
was then unu&s;ual. But the misfortunes, which the Dutch
met with in battle, were &s;mall in compari&s;on of tho&s;e,
which their trade &s;u&s;tained from the Engli&s;h. Their
whole commerce by the Channel was cut off: Even that
to the Baltic was much infe&s;ted by the Engli&s;h priva|teers.
Their fi&s;heries were totally &s;u&s;pended. A great
number of their &s;hips, above 1600, had fallen into the
enemies hands. And all this di&s;tre&s;s they &s;uffered, not
for any national intere&s;t or nece&s;&s;ity; but from vain
points of honour and per&s;onal re&s;entments, of which it
was difficult to give a &s;atisfactory account to the public.
They re&s;olved therefore to gratify the pride of the par|liament,
and to make &s;ome advances towards a peace.
Their reception, however, was not favourable; and it
was not without plea&s;ure, that they learned the di&s;&s;olu|tion
of that haughty a&s;&s;embly by the violence of Crom|wel;
an event from which they expected a more pro&s;pe|rous
turn to their affairs.</P>
<P>THE zealous republicans in the parliament had not
been the chief or fir&s;t promoters of the war; but when
it was once entered upon, they endeavoured to draw
from it every po&s;&s;ible advantage. On all occa&s;ions, they
&s;et up the fleet in oppo&s;ition to the army, and celebrated
the glory and &s;ucce&s;&s;es of their naval armaments. They
in&s;i&s;ted on the intolerable expence to which the nation
was &s;ubjected, and urged the nece&s;&s;ity of dimini&s;hing it
by a reduction of their land forces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;olution of the par|liament.</NOTE> They had ordered
&s;ome regiments to &s;erve on board the fleet in the quality

proceedings, evidently &s;aw, that they had entertained a
jealou&s;y of his power and ambition, and were re&s;olved
to bring him to a &s;ubordination under their authority.
Without &s;cruple or delay he re&s;olved to prevent them.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="299">
ON &s;uch firm foundations was built the credit of this
extraordinary man, that, though a great ma&s;ter of
fraud and di&s;&s;imulation, he judged it &s;uperfluous to em|ploy
any di&s;gui&s;e in conducting that bold enterprize.
He &s;ummoned a general council of officers; and imme|diately
found, that they were di&s;po&s;ed to receive what|ever
impre&s;&s;ions he was plea&s;ed to give them. Mo&s;t of
them were his creatures, had owed their advancement to
his favour, and relied entirely upon him for their fu|ture
preferment. The breach being already made be|tween
the military and civil powers, when the late King
was &s;eized at Holmby; the general officers regarded the
parliament as at once their creature and their rival; and
thought that they them&s;elves were entitled to &s;hare among
them tho&s;e offices and riches, of which its members had
&s;o long kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Harri&s;on, Rich, Overton, and
a few others, who retained &s;ome principle, were guided
by notions &s;o extravagant, that they were ea&s;ily deluded
into mea&s;ures the mo&s;t violent and mo&s;t criminal. And
the whole army had already been guilty of &s;uch illegal
and atrocious actions, that they could entertain no far|ther
&s;cruples with regard to any enterprize, which might
&s;erve their &s;elfi&s;h or fanatical purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the council of officers it was pre&s;ently voted to
frame a remon&s;trance to the parliament. After com|plaining
of the arrears, which were due to the army,
they there de&s;ired the parliament to remember how many
years they had &s;at, and what profe&s;&s;ions they had for|merly
made of their intentions to new model the repre|&s;entative,
and e&s;tabli&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ive parliaments, who might
bear that burthen of national affairs, from which they
them&s;elves would gladly, after &s;o much danger and fa|tigue,
be at la&s;t relieved. They confe&s;&s;ed, that the par|liament
had atchieved great enterprizes, and had &s;ur|mounted
mighty difficulties; yet was it an injury, they
&s;aid, to the re&s;t of the nation to be excluded from bear|ing
<PB N="226" REF="300">
any part in the &s;ervice of their country. It was now
full time for them to give place to others; and they
therefore de&s;ired them, after &s;ettling a council, who
might execute the laws during the interval, to &s;ummon
a new parliament, and e&s;tabli&s;h that free and equal go|vernment,
which they had &s;o long promi&s;ed to the
people.</P>
<P>THE parliament took this remon&s;trance in very ill
part, and made a &s;harp reply to the council of officers.
The officers in&s;i&s;ted on their advice; and by mutual al|tercation
and oppo&s;ition, the breach became &s;till wider
between the army and the Commonwealth.<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of April.</NOTE> Cromwel,
finding matters ripe for his purpo&s;e, called a council of
officers, in order to come to a determination with regard
to the public &s;ettlement. As he had here many friends,
&s;o had he al&s;o &s;ome opponents. Harri&s;on having a&s;&s;ured
the council, that the General &s;ought only to pave the way
for the government of Je&s;us and his &s;aints, Major Streater
bri&s;kly replied, that Je&s;us ought then to come quickly:
For if he delayed it till after Chri&s;tmas, he would come
too late; he would find his place occupied While the
officers were in debate, Colonel Ingold&s;by informs
Cromwel, that the parliament were &s;itting, and had
come to a re&s;olution not to di&s;&s;olve them&s;elves, but to
fill up the hou&s;e by new elections; and were at that
very time engaged in deliberations with regard to this
expedient. Cromwel in a ra$e immediately ha&s;tens to
the hou&s;e, and carries a body of 300 &s;oldiers along with
him. Some of them he placed at the door, &s;ome in the
lobby, &s;ome on the &s;tairs. He fir&s;t addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to
his friend St. John, and told him, that he had come
with a purpo&s;e of doing what grieved him to the very
&s;oul, and what he had earne&s;tly with tears prayed th$
Lord not to impo&s;e upon him: But there was a nece&s;|&s;ity,
in order to the glory of God and good of the na|tion.
He &s;at down for &s;ome time, and heard the de|bat$s
<PB N="227" REF="301">
He beckoned Harri&s;on, and told him, that he
now judged the parliament ripe for a di&s;&s;olution, &startq;Sir,&endq;
&s;aid Harri&s;on, &startq;the work is very great and dangerous:
I de&s;ire you &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, before you engage in
it.&endq; &startq;You &s;ay well,&endq; replied the General; and thereupon
&s;at &s;till about a quarter of an hour. When the que&s;tion
was ready to be put, he &s;aid again to Harri&s;on, &startq;This
is the time: I mu&s;t do it.&endq; And &s;uddenly &s;tarting
up, he loaded the parliament with the vile&s;t reproaches,
for their tyranny, ambition oppre&s;&s;ion, and robbery of
the public. Then &s;tamping with his foot, which was
the &s;ignal for the &s;oldiers to enter, &startq;For &s;hame,&endq; &s;aid
he to the parliament, &startq;get you gone: Give place to
hone&s;ter men; to tho&s;e who will more faithfully di&s;|charge
their tru&s;t. You are no longer a parliament:
I tell you, you are no longer a parliament. The
Lord has done with you: He has cho&s;en other in|&s;truments
for carrying on his work.&endq; Sir Harry
Vane exclaiming again&s;t this procedure, he cried with a
loud voice, &startq;O! Sir Harry Vane, Sir Harry Vane!
The Lord deliver me from Sir Harry Vane!&endq; Tak|ing
hold of Martin by the cloke, &startq;Thou art a
whore ma&s;ter,&endq; &s;aid he. To another, &startq;Thou art
an adulterer. To a third, Thou art a drunkard
and a glutton:&endq; &startq;And thou an extortioner,&endq; to a
fourth. He commanded a &s;oldier to &s;eize the m$ce.
&startq;What &s;hall we do with this bauble? Here take it
away. It is you,&endq; &s;aid he, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the
hou&s;e, &startq;that have forced me upon this. I have &s;ought
the Lord, night and day, that he would rather &s;lay
me than put me upon this work.&endq; Having com|manded
the &s;oldiers to clear the hall, he him&s;elf went
out the la&s;t, and ordering the doors to be locked, de|parted
to his lodgings in Whitehall.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="302">
IN this furious manner, which &s;o well denotes his ge|nuine
character, did Cromwel, without the lea&s;t oppo|&s;ition,
or even murmur, annihilate that famous a&s;&s;em|bly,
which had filled all Europe with the renown of its
actions, and with a&s;toni&s;hment at its crimes, and who&s;e
commencement was not more ardently de&s;ired by the
people than was its final di&s;&s;olution. All parties now
reaped &s;ucce&s;&s;ively the di&s;mal plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the in|juries,
which they had &s;uffered, revenged on their ene|mies;
and that too by the &s;ame arts, which had been
practi&s;ed again&s;t them. The King had &s;tretched his
prerogative beyond its ju&s;t bounds; and aided by the
church, had well nigh put an end to all the liberties and
privileges of the nation. The pre&s;byterians checked
the progre&s;s of the court and clergy, and excited, by
cant and hypocri&s;y, the populace fir&s;t to tumults, then
to war, again&s;t the King, the peers, and all the roya|li&s;ts.
No &s;ooner had they reached the pinnacle of gran|deur,
than the independants, under the appearance of
&s;till greater &s;anctity, in&s;tigated the army again&s;t them,
and reduced them to &s;ubjection. The independants,
amid&s;t their empty dreams of liberty, or rather of do|minion,
were oppre&s;&s;ed by the rebellion of their own
&s;ervants, and found them&s;elves at once expo&s;ed to the
in&s;ults of power and hatred of the people. By recent,
as well as all antient example, it was become evident,
that illegal violence, with whatever pretences it may be
covered, and whatever object it may pur&s;ue, mu&s;t in|evitably
end at la&s;t in the arbitrary and de&s;potic govern|ment
of a &s;ingle per&s;on.</P>

Huntingdon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel's birth and pri|vate life.</NOTE> the la&s;t year of the former century, of a
very good family; tho' he him&s;elf, being the &s;on of a
&s;econd brother, inherited but a &s;mall e&s;tate from his fa|ther.
In the cour&s;e of his education he had been &s;ent
to the univer&s;ity; but his genius was found little fitted
for the calm and elegant occupations of learning; and
he made &s;mall proficiency in his &s;tudies. He even threw
him&s;elf into a very di&s;&s;olute and di&s;orderly cour&s;e of life;
and he con&s;umed, in gaming, drinking, debauchery,
and country riots, the more early years of his youth,
and di&s;&s;ipated part of his patrimony. All of a &s;udden,
the &s;pirit of reformation &s;eized him; he married, af|fected
a grave and compo&s;ed behaviour, entered into all
the zeal and rigour of the puritanical party, and offered
to re&s;tore to every one whatever &s;ums he had formerly
gained by gaming. The &s;ame vehemence of temper,
which had tran&s;ported him into the extremes of plea&s;ure,
now di&s;tingui&s;hed his religious habits. His hou&s;e was
<PB N="230" REF="304">
the re&s;ort of all the z&eacute;alous clergy of the party; and his
ho&s;pitality, as well as his liberalities to the &s;ilenced and
deprived mini&s;ters, proved as chargeable as his former
debaucheries. Tho' he had acquired a tolerable fortune
by a maternal uncle, he found his affairs &s;o injured by his
expences, that he was obliged to take a farm at St. Ives,
and apply him&s;elf, for &s;ome years, to agriculture as a pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
But this expedient &s;erved rather to involve him in
farther debts and difficulties. The long prayers which he
&s;aid to his family in the morning, and again in the afternoon,
con&s;umed his own time and that of his ploughmen; and
he re&s;erved no lei&s;ure for the care of his temporal affairs,
His active mind, &s;uperior to the low occupations, to
which he was condemned, preyed upon it&s;elf; and he
indulged his imagination in vi&s;ions, illuminations, revela|tions;
the great nouri&s;hment of that hypocondriacal
temper, to which he was ever &s;ubject. Urged by his
wants and his devotions, he had formed a party with
Hambden, his near kin&s;man, who was pre&s;&s;ed only by
the latter motive, to tran&s;port him&s;elf into New England,
now become the retreat of the more zealous among the
puritanical party; and it was an order of council, which
obliged them to di&s;embark and remain in England. The
Earl of Bedford, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large e&s;tate in the Fen
Country, near the i&s;le of Ely, having undertaken to
drain the&s;e moraffes, was obliged to apply to the King;
and by the powers of the prerogative, he got commi&s;|&s;ioners
appointed, who conducted that work, and divided
the new acquired land among the &s;everal proprietors.
He met with oppo&s;ition from many, among whom
Cromwel di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf; and this was the fir&s;t
public opportunity, which he had met met with, of di&s;|covering
the factious zeal and ob&s;tinacy of his character.</P>
<P>FROM accident and intrigue he was cho&s;en by the
town of Cambridge member of the long parliament.
His dome&s;tic affairs were then in great di&s;order; and he
<PB N="231" REF="305">
&s;eemed not to po&s;&s;e&s;s any talents, which could qualify
him to ri&s;e in that public &s;phere, into which he was now
at la&s;t entered. His per&s;on was ungraceful, his dre&s;s
&s;lovenly, his voice untuneable, his elocution homely,
tedious, ob&s;cure, and embarra&s;&s;ed. The fervor of his
&s;pirit frequently prompted him to ri&s;e in the hou&s;e; but
he was not heard with attention: His name, for above
two years, is not to be found oftener than twice in any
committee; and tho&s;e committees, into which he was
admitted, were cho&s;en for affairs, which would more in|tere&s;t
the zealots than the men of bu&s;ine&s;s. In compa|ri&s;on
of the eloquent &s;peakers and fine gentlemen of the
hou&s;e, he was entirely overlooked; and his friend Hamb|den
alone was acquainted with the depth of his genius,
and foretold, that if a civil war &s;hould en&s;ue, he would
&s;oon ri&s;e to eminence and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>CROMWEL him&s;elf &s;eems to have been con&s;cious
where his &s;trength lay; and partly from that motive,
partly from the uncontroleable fury of his zeal, he al|ways
joined that party, which pu&s;hed every thing to ex|tremity
again&s;t the King. He was very active for the
famous remon&s;trance, which was the &s;ignal for all the
en&s;uing commotions; and when, after a long debate, it
was carried by a &s;mall majority, he told Lord Falkland,
that, if the que&s;tion had been lo&s;t, he was re&s;olved next
day to have converted into ready money the remains of
his fortune, and immediately to have left the kingdom.
Nor was this re&s;olution, he &s;aid, peculiar to him&s;elf:
Many others of his party he knew to be equally deter|mined.</P>
<P>HE was no le&s;s than forty-three years of age, when he
fir&s;t embraced the military profe&s;&s;ion; and by force of
genius, without any ma&s;ter, he &s;oon became an excel|lent
officer; tho' perhaps he never reached the fame of
a con&s;ummate commander. He rai&s;ed a troop of hor&s;e,
<PB N="232" REF="306">
fixed his quarters in Cambridge, exerted great &s;everity
towards that univer&s;ity, which zealou&s;ly adhered to the
royal party; and &s;howed him&s;elf a man who would go
all lengths in favour of that cau&s;e, which he had
e&s;pou&s;ed. He would not allow his &s;oldiers to perplex
their heads with tho&s;e &s;ubtilties of fighting by the King's
authority again&s;t his per&s;on, and of obeying his Maje&s;ty's
orders &s;ignified by both hou&s;es of parliament: He plainly
told them, that, if he met the King in battle, he would
fire a pi&s;tol in his face as readily as again&s;t any other
man. His troop of hor&s;e he &s;oon augmented to a regi|ment,
and he fir&s;t in&s;tituted that di&s;cipline and in&s;pired
that &s;pirit, which rendered the parliamentary armies in
the end victorious. &startq;Your troops,&endq; &s;aid he to Hamb|den,
according to his own account<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Conference held at Whitehall.</NOTE>, &startq;are mo&s;t of
them old decayed &s;erving men and tap&s;ters, and &s;uch
kind of fellows; the King's forces are compo&s;ed of
gentlemen's younger &s;ons and per&s;ons of good quality.
And do you think, that the mean &s;pirits of &s;uch ba&s;e
and low fellows as ours will ever be able to encounter
gentlemen, that have honour and courage and re&s;o|lution
in them? You mu&s;t get men of &s;pirit; and
take it not ill that I &s;ay, of a &s;pirit, that is likely to
go as far as gentlemen will go, or el&s;e I am &s;ure
you will &s;till be beaten, as you have hitherto been, in
every rencounter.&endq; He did as he propo&s;ed. He in|li&s;ted
freeholders and farmers &s;ons. He carefully invited
into his regiment all the zealous fanatics throughout
England. When collected in a body, their enthu&s;ia&s;tic
&s;pirit &s;till ro&s;e to a higher pitch. Their colonel, from
his own natural character, as much as from policy, was
&s;ufficiently inclined to encrea&s;e the flame. He preached,
he prayed, he fought, he puni&s;hed, he rewarded. The
wild enthu&s;ia&s;m, together with valour and di&s;cipline,
&s;till propagated it&s;elf; and all men ca&s;t their eyes on &s;o
<PB N="233" REF="307">
pious and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a leader. From low commands,
he ro&s;e with great rapidity to be really the fir&s;t, tho' in
appearance only the &s;econd, in the army. By fraud
and violence, he &s;oon rendered him&s;elf the fir&s;t in the
&s;tate. In proportion to the increa&s;e of his authority,
his talents &s;eemed always to expand them&s;elves; and
he di&s;played every day new abilities, which had lain dor|mant
till the very emergence, by which they were called
forth into action. All Europe &s;tood a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee a
nation, &s;o turbulent and unruly, who, for &s;ome en|croachments
on their privileges, had dethroned and mur|dered
an excellent Prince, de&s;cended from a long line of
monarchs, now at la&s;t &s;ubdued and reduced to &s;lavery by
one, who, a few years before, was no better than a pri|vate
gentleman, who&s;e name was not known in the na|tion,
and who was very little regarded even in that low
&s;phere, to which he had always been confined.</P>
<P>THE indignation, entertained by the people, again&s;t
an authority, founded on &s;uch manife&s;t u&s;urpation, was
not &s;o violent as might naturally be expected. Con|gratulatory
addre&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t of the kind, were made
to Cromwel by the fleet, the army, even many of the
chief corporations and counties of England; but e&s;pe|cially
by the &s;everal congregations of pretended saints,
di&s;per&s;ed throughout the kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">See Milton's State papers.</NOTE>. The royali&s;ts,
tho' they could not love the man, who had embrued his
hands in the blood of their &s;overeign, expected more le|nity
from him, than from the jealous and imperious re|publicans,
who had hitherto governed. The pre&s;byte|rians
were plea&s;ed to &s;ee tho&s;e men, by whom they had
been outwitted and expelled, now in the end expelled
and outwitted by their own &s;ervant; and they applauded
him, for this la&s;t act of violence upon the parliament.
The&s;e two parties compo&s;ed the bulk of the nation, and
kept the people in &s;ome tolerable temper. All men,
<PB N="234" REF="308">
likewi&s;e, harra&s;&s;ed with wars and factions, were glad to
&s;ee any pro&s;pect of ju&s;tice and &s;ettlement. And they
deemed it le&s;s ignominious to &s;ubmit to a per&s;on of &s;uch
admirable talents and capacity than to a few ignoble en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
hypocrites, who, under the name of a republic,
had reduced them to a cruel &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THE republicans being dethroned by Cromwel, were
the party who&s;e re&s;entment he had the greate&s;t rea&s;on to
apprehend. That party, be&s;ides the independants, con|tained
two &s;ets of men, who are &s;eemingly of the mo&s;t
oppo&s;ite principles, but who were then united by a &s;imi|litude
of genius and of character. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t
numerous were the millenarians, or fifth monarchy men,
who in&s;i&s;ted, that, dominion being founded in grace, all
di&s;tinction of magi&s;tracy mu&s;t be aboli&s;hed, except what
aro&s;e from piety and holine&s;s; who expected &s;uddenly
the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t upon earth; and who pre|tended,
that the &s;aints in the mean while, that is, them|&s;elves,
were alone entitled to govern. The &s;econd were
the dei&s;ts, who had no other object than political liber|ty,
who denied entirely the truth of revelation, and in|&s;inuated,
that all the various &s;ects, &s;o heated again&s;t each
other were alike founded in folly and in error. Men
of &s;uch daring geniu&s;es were not contented with the
e&s;tabli&s;hed forms of civil government; but challenged a
degree of freedom beyond what they expected ever to
enjoy under any monarchy. Martin, Challoner, Har|rington,
Sidney, Wildman, Nevil, were e&s;teemed the
heads of this &s;mall divi&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE dei&s;ts were perfectly hated by Cromwel, becau&s;e
he had no hold of enthu&s;ia&s;m by which he could govern|or
over-reach them; he therefore treated them with
great rigor and di&s;dain, and u&s;ually denominated then
the <HI>heathens.</HI> As the millenarians had a great intere$$
in the army, it was much more important for him t$
<PB N="235" REF="309">
gain their confidence; and their &s;ize of under&s;tanding
afforded him great facility in deceiving them. Of late
years, it had been &s;o u&s;ual a topic of conver&s;ation to
di&s;cour&s;e of parliaments and councils and &s;enates, and
the &s;oldiers them&s;elves had been &s;o much accu&s;tomed to
enter into that &s;pirit, that Cromwel thought it requi&s;ite
to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;omething which might bear the face of a
commonwealth. He &s;uppo&s;ed, that God, in his provi|dence,
had thrown the whole right as well as power of
government into his hands; and without any more ce|remony,
by the advice of his council of officers, he &s;ent
&s;ummons to a hundred and twenty-eight per&s;ons of dif|ferent
towns and counties of England, to five of Scot|land,
to &s;ix of Ireland. He pretended, by his &s;ole act
and deed, to devolve upon the&s;e per&s;ons the whole au|thority
of the &s;tate.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barebone's Parliament.</NOTE> This legi&s;lative power they were
to exerci&s;e during fifteen months; and they were after|wards
to choo&s;e the &s;ame number of per&s;ons, who might
&s;ucceed them in that high and important office.</P>
<P>THERE were great numbers at that time, always di&s;|po&s;ed
to adhere to the power, which was uppermo&s;t,
and to &s;upport the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. This maxim
is not peculiar to the people of that age; but what may
be e&s;teemed peculiar to them, is, that there prevailed an
hypocritical phra&s;e for expre&s;&s;ing &s;o prudential a conduct:
It was called a waiting upon providence. When pro|vidence,
therefore, was &s;o kind as to be&s;tow on the&s;e
per&s;ons, now a&s;&s;embled together, the &s;upreme authority,
they mu&s;t have been very ungrateful, if, in their turn,
they had been wanting in complai&s;ance towards it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of July.</NOTE> They
immediately voted them&s;elves a parliament; and having
their own con&s;ent, as well as that of Oliver Cromwel,
for their legi&s;lative authority, they now proceeded very
gravely to the exerci&s;e of it.</P>
<P>IN this notable a&s;&s;embly were &s;ome per&s;ons of the rank
of gentlemen; but the far greate&s;t part were low me|chanics;
<PB N="236" REF="310">
fifth monarchy men, anabapti&s;ts, antinomians,
independants; the very dregs of the fanatics. They
began with &s;eeking God by prayer: This office was
performed by eight or ten <HI>gifted</HI> men of the a&s;|&s;embly;
and with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, that, according to
the confe&s;&s;ion of all, they had never before, in any of
their devout exerci&s;es, enjoyed &s;o much of the holy
&s;pirit as was then communicated to them. Their hearts
were, no doubt, dilated when they con&s;idered the high
dignity, to which they &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves exalted.
They had been told by Cromwel in his fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e,
that he never looked to &s;ee &s;uch a day, when Chri&s;t
&s;hould be &s;o owned<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are his expre&s;&s;ions. &startq;Indeed, I have but one word more to &s;ay to you, tho' in that perhaps I &s;hall &s;how my weakne&s;s: It is by way of encouragement to you in this work; give me leave to begin thus: I con|fe&s;s I never looked to have &s;een &s;uch a day as this, it may be nor you nei|ther, when Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hould be &s;o owned as he is at this day and in this work. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is owned this day by your call, and you own him by your willingne&s;s to appear for him, and you manife&s;t this (as far as poor creatures can do) to be a day of the power of Chri&s;t. I know you well remember that &s;cripture, <HI>he makes his people willing in the day of his power.</HI> God manife&s;ts it to be the day of the power of Chri&s;t, having thro' &s;o much blood and &s;o much tryal as has been upon this nation, he makes this one of the greate&s;t mercies, next to his own &s;on, to have his people called to the &s;upreme authority. God hath owned his &s;on, and hath owned you, and hath made you to own him. I confe&s;s, I never looked to have &s;een &s;uch a day: I did not.&endq; I &s;uppo&s;e at this pa&s;&s;age he cried: For he was very much given to weeping, and could at any time &s;hed abundance of tears. The re&s;t of the &s;peech may be &s;een among Milton's State papers, page 106. It is very curious, and full of the &s;ame ob&s;curity, confu&s;ion, embarra&s;&s;ment and ab&s;urdity, which appear in almo&s;t all Oliver's productions.</NOTE>. They thought it therefore their
duty to proceed to a thorough reformation, and to pave
the way for the reign of the Redeemer, and for that
great work, which, it was expected, the Lord was to
bring forth among them. All fanatics, being con&s;e|crated
by their own fond imaginations, naturally bear an
antipathy to the clergy, who claim a peculiar &s;anctity,
derived merely from their office and prie&s;tly character.
This parliament took into con&s;ideration the abolition of
<PB N="237" REF="311">
the clerical function, as favouring of popery; and the
taking away tythes, which they called a relict of Ju|dai&s;m.
Learning al&s;o and the univer&s;ities they deemed
heatheni&s;h and unnece&s;&s;ary: The common law they de|nominated
a badge of the conque&s;t and of Norman &s;la|very;
and threatened the lawyers with a total abrogation
of their profe&s;&s;ion. Some &s;teps were even taken to|wards
an abolition of the chancery<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 543, 548.</NOTE>, the highe&s;t court
of judicature in the kingdom; and the Mo&s;aical law
was intended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed as the &s;ole &s;y&s;tem of Eng|li&s;h
juri&s;prudence<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Conference held at Whitehall.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OF all the extraordinary &s;chemes, adopted by the&s;e
legi&s;lators, they had not lei&s;ure to fini&s;h any, except
that which e&s;tabli&s;hed the legal &s;olemnization of mar|riage
by the civil magi&s;trate alone, without the interpo|&s;ition
of the clergy. They found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to
the deri&s;ion of the public. Among the fanatics of the
hou&s;e, there was a very active member, much noted for
long prayers, &s;ermons, and harangues. He was a lea|ther-&s;eller
in London: His name <HI>Prai&s;e-god Barebone.</HI>
This ridiculous name, which &s;eems to have been cho&s;en
by &s;ome poet or allegori&s;t to &s;uit &s;o ridiculous a per&s;on|age,
&s;truck the fancy of the people; and they com|monly

THE Dutch amba&s;&s;adors endeavoured to enter into
negotiation with this parliament; but tho' prote&s;tants
and even pre&s;byterians, they met with a very bad recep|tion
from tho&s;e who pretended to a &s;anctity &s;o much &s;u|perior.
The Hollanders were regarded as worldly minded
men, intent only on commerce and indu&s;try; whom it
was fitting the &s;aints &s;hould fir&s;t eradicate, ere they un|dertook
that great work, to which they believed them|&s;elves

of the earth the kingdom of the Redeemer<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. I. p. 273, 591. Al&s;o Stubbe, p. 91, 92.</NOTE>. The am|ba&s;&s;adors,
finding them&s;elves pro&s;cribed, not as enemies
of England, but of Chri&s;t, remained in a&s;toni&s;hment,
and knew not which was mo&s;t to be admired, the im|placable
&s;pirit or egregious folly of the&s;e pretended
&s;aints.</P>
<P>CROMWEL began to be a&s;hamed of his legi&s;lature.
If he ever had any other de&s;ign in &s;ummoning &s;o pre|po&s;terous
an a&s;&s;embly beyond amu&s;ing the populace and
the army; he had intended to alarm the clergy and
lawyers; and he had &s;o far &s;ucceeded as to make them
de&s;ire any other government, which might &s;ecure their
profe&s;&s;ions, now brought in danger by the&s;e de&s;perate fa|natics.
Cromwel him&s;elf was di&s;&s;atisfied, that the par|liament,
tho' they had received all their authority from
him, began to pretend power from the Lord<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. I. p. 393.</NOTE>, and to
<PB N="239" REF="313">
in&s;i&s;t already on their divine commi&s;&s;ion. He had
carefully &s;ummoned in his writs &s;everal per&s;ons entirely
devoted to him. By concert, the&s;e met early; and it
was mentioned by &s;ome among them, that the &s;itting of
this parliament any longer would be of no &s;ervice to
the nation. They ha&s;tened, therefore, to Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of De|cember.</NOTE>
along with Rou&s;e, their &s;peaker; and by a formal deed
or a&s;&s;ignment, re&s;igned back into his hands that &s;upreme
authority, which they had &s;o lately received from him.
General Harri&s;on and about twenty more remained in
the hou&s;e; and that they might prevent the reign of the
&s;aints from coming to an untimely end, they placed one
Moyer in the chair, and began to draw up prote&s;ts.
They were &s;oon interrupted by Colonel White, with a
party of &s;oldiers. He a&s;ked them what they did there.
&startq;We are &s;eeking the Lord,&endq; &s;aid they. &startq;Then you
may go el&s;ewhere,&endq; replied he: For to my certain
&startq;knowledge, he has not been here the&s;e &s;everal
years.&endq;</P>
<P>THE military being now in appearance, as well as in
reality, the &s;ole power which prevailed in the nation,
Cromwel thought fit to indulge a new fancy: For he
&s;eems not to have had any concerted plan in all the&s;e
alterations. Lambert, his creature, who, under the
appearance of ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to him, indulged a mo&s;t
unbounded ambition, propo&s;ed in a council of officers
to adopt another &s;cheme of government, and to temper
the liberty of a Commonwealth by the authority of a
&s;ingle per&s;on, who &s;hould be known by the appellation
of Protector. Without delay,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel made Pro|tector.</NOTE> he prepared what was
called the In&s;trument of Government, containing the
plan of this new legi&s;lature; and as it was &s;uppo&s;ed to
be agreeable to the general, it was immediately voted
by the council of officers. Cromwel was declared Pro|tector;
and with great &s;olemnity in&s;talled in that high
office.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="314">
SO little were the&s;e men endowed with the &s;pirit of
legi&s;lation, that they confe&s;&s;ed, or rather boa&s;ted, that
they had employed only four days in drawing this in|&s;trument,
by which the whole government of the three
kingdoms was pretended to be regulated and adju&s;ted
for all &s;ucceeding generations. There appears no diffi|culty
in believing them; when it is con&s;idered how
crude and undige&s;ted a &s;y&s;tem of civil polity they en|deavoured
to e&s;tabli&s;h. The chief articles of the in|&s;trument
are the&s;e: A council was appointed, which
was not to exceed twenty-one, nor be le&s;s than thirteen
per&s;ons. The&s;e were to enjoy their office during life or
good behaviour; and in ca&s;e of a vacancy, the remain|ing
members named three, of whom the Protector cho&s;e
one. The Protector was appointed the &s;upreme magi&s;|trate
of the Commonwealth: In his name was all ju&s;|tice
admini&s;tered; from him were all magi&s;tracy and all
honours derived; he had the power of pardoning all
crimes, excepting murder and trea&s;on; to him the be|nefit
of all forfeitures devolved. The right of peace,
war, and alliance, re&s;ted in him; but in the&s;e particu|lars
he was to act entirely by the advice and with the
con&s;ent of his council. The power of the &s;word was
ve&s;ted in the Protector, jointly with the parliament,
while it was &s;itting, or with the council of &s;tate in the
intervals. He was obliged to &s;ummon a parliament
every three years, and allow them to &s;it five months,
without adjournment, prorogation, or di&s;&s;olution. The
bills, which they enacted, were to be pre&s;ented to the
Protector for his con&s;ent; but if within twenty days it
was not obtained, they were to pa&s;s into laws by the
authority alone of the parliament. A &s;tanding army for
Britain and Ireland was e&s;tabli&s;hed, of 20,000 foot and
10,000 hor&s;e; and funds were a&s;&s;igned for their &s;up|port.
The&s;e were not to be dimini&s;hed without con|&s;ent
of the Protector; and in this article alone he a&s;|&s;umed

a negative. During the intervals of parliament,
the Protector and council had the power of enacting
laws, which were valid till the fir&s;t meeting of parlia|ment.
The chancellor, trea&s;urer, admiral, chief go|vernors
of Ireland and Scotland, and the chief ju&s;tices
of both the benches mu&s;t be cho&s;en with the approba|tion
of parliament; and in the intervals, with the ap|probation
of the council, to be afterwards ratified by
parliament. The Protector enjoyed his office during
life; and on his death, the place was immediately to be
&s;upplied by the council. This was the in&s;trument of
government enacted by the council of officers, and &s;o|lemnly
&s;worn to by Oliver Cromwel. The council of
&s;tate named by the In&s;trument were fifteen; men en|tirely
devoted to the Protector, and not likely, by rea|&s;on
of the oppo&s;ition among them&s;elves in party and
principles, ever to combine again&s;t him.</P>
<P>CROMWEL &s;aid, that he accepted the dignity of Pro|tector,
merely that he might exert the duty of a con|stable;
and pre&s;erve peace in the nation. Affairs indeed
were brought to that pa&s;s, by the furious animo&s;ities of
the &s;everal factions, that the exten&s;ive authority and
even arbitrary power of &s;ome fir&s;t magi&s;trate was become
a nece&s;&s;ary evil, in order to keep the people from relap|&s;ing
into blood and confu&s;ion. The independants were
too &s;mall a party ever to e&s;tabli&s;h a popular government,
or entru&s;t the nation, where they had &s;o little intere&s;t,
with the free choice of its own repre&s;entatives. The
pre&s;byterians had adopted the violent maxims of per&s;e|cution;
incompatible at all times with the peace of &s;o|ciety,
much more with the wild zeal of tho&s;e numerous
&s;ects, which prevailed among the people. The royali&s;ts
were &s;o much enraged by the injuries, which they had
&s;uffered, that the other prevailing parties would never
&s;ubmit to them, who, they knew, were enabled merely
by the execution of the antient laws, to take &s;uch &s;e|vere

revenge upon them. Had Cromwel been guilty of
no crime but this temporary u&s;urpation, the plea of ne|ce&s;&s;ity
and public good, which he alleged, might be al|lowed,
in every view, a very rea&s;onable excu&s;e for his
conduct.</P>
<P>DURING the variety of ridiculous and di&s;tracted &s;cenes,
which the civil government pre&s;ented in England, the
military force was exerted with the utmo&s;t vigor, con|duct,
and unanimity; and never did the kingdom appear
more formidable to all foreign nations. The Engli&s;h
fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of a hundred &s;ail, and commanded by
Monk and Dean, and under them by Pen and Lau|&s;on,
met, near the coa&s;t of Flanders, with the Dutch
fleet, equally numerous, and commanded by Tromp.
The two republics were not inflamed by any national
antipathy, and their intere&s;ts very little interfered: Yet
few battles have been fought with more fierce and ob|&s;tinate
courage than were tho&s;e many naval combats,
which occurred during this &s;hort, but violent war. The
de&s;ire of remaining &s;ole lords of the ocean animated
the&s;e &s;tates to an honourable emulation again&s;t each
other. After a battle of two days, in the fir&s;t of which
Dean was killed, the Dutch, inferior in the &s;ize of their
&s;hips, were obliged, with great lo&s;s, to retire into their
harbours. Blake, towards the end of the fight, joined
his countrymen with 18 &s;ail. The Engli&s;h fleet lay off
the coa&s;t of Holland, and totally interrupted the com|merce
of that republic.</P>
<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors, whom the Dutch had &s;ent into
England, gave them hopes of peace. But as they could
obtain no ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, the &s;tates, unwilling to
&s;uffer any longer the lo&s;s and di&s;grace of being blockaded
by their enemy, made the utmo&s;t efforts to recover their
injured honour. Never on any occa&s;ion did the power
and vigor of that &s;tate appear in a more con&s;picuous
<PB N="243" REF="319">
light. In a few weeks, they had repaired and manned
their fleet; and they equipped &s;ome &s;hips of a larger &s;ize,
than any which they had hitherto &s;ent to &s;ea. Tromp
i&s;&s;ued out, determined again to fight the victors, and to
die rather than to yield the conte&s;t. He met with the
enemy, commanded by Monk; and both &s;ides imme|diately
ru&s;hed into the combat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of July.</NOTE> Tromp, gallantly ani|mating
his men, with his &s;word drawn, was &s;hot thro'
the heart with a mu&s;quet ball. This event alone de|cided
the battle in favour of the Engli&s;h. Tho' near
thirty &s;hips of the Dutch were &s;unk and taken, they little
regarded this lo&s;s compared with that of their brave ad|miral.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE the negotiations of peace were conti|nually
advancing. The &s;tates, overwhelmed with the
expences of the war, terrified by their lo&s;&s;es, and mor|tified
by their defeats, were infinitely de&s;irous of an ac|commodation
with an enemy whom they found, by ex|perience,
to be too powerful for them. The King
having &s;hown a de&s;ire to &s;erve on board their fleet; tho'
they expre&s;&s;ed their &s;en&s;e of the honour intended them,
they declined an offer, which might enflame the quarrel
with the Engli&s;h Commonwealth. The great ob&s;tacle
to the peace was found not to be any animo&s;ity in the
Engli&s;h; but on the contrary a de&s;ire too earne&s;t of
union and confederacy. Cromwel had revived the chi|merical
&s;cheme of a coalition with the United Provinces;
a total conjunction of government, privileges, intere&s;ts,
and councils. This project appeared &s;o wild to the
States General,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1654.</NOTE> that they wondered any man of &s;en&s;e
could ever entertain it;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th April.</NOTE> and they refu&s;ed to enter into
conferences with regard to a propo&s;al, which could &s;erve
only to delay any practicable &s;cheme of accommodation.
The peace was at la&s;t &s;igned by Cromwel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Holland$</NOTE> now inve&s;ted
with the dignity of Protector; and it proves &s;ufficiently,
that the war had been very impolitic, &s;ince after the
<PB N="244" REF="320">
mo&s;t &s;ignal victories, no terms more advantageous could
be obtained. A defen&s;ive league was made between the
two republics. They agreed, each of them, to bani&s;h
the enemies of the other; tho&s;e concerned in the ma&s;|&s;acre
of Amboyna were to be puni&s;hed, if any remained
alive; the honour of the flag was yielded to the Eng|li&s;h;
eighty-five thou&s;and pounds were &s;tipulated to be
payed by the Dutch Ea&s;t India company for lo&s;&s;es, which
the Engli&s;h company had &s;u&s;tained; and the i&s;land of
Polarone in the Ea&s;t Indies was promi&s;ed to be yielded
to the latter.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, jealous of the connexions between the
royal family and that of Orange, in&s;i&s;ted on a &s;eparate
article; that neither the young Prince nor any of his fa|mily
&s;hould ever be inve&s;ted with the dignity of Stad|holder.
The province of Holland, &s;trongly prejudiced
again&s;t that office, which they e&s;teemed dangerous to li|berty,
&s;ecretly ratified this article. The Protector,
knowing that the other provinces would never be in|duced
to make &s;uch a conce&s;&s;ion, was &s;atisfied with
that &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>THE Dutch war, being &s;ucce&s;sful, and the peace
rea&s;onable, brought credit to Cromwel's admini&s;tration.
An act of ju&s;tice, which he exerci&s;ed at home, gave
likewi&s;e &s;atisfaction to the people; tho' the regularity of
it may perhaps appear &s;omewhat doubtful. Don Pan|taleon
Sa, brother to the Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;ador, and
joined with him in the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. II. p. 429.</NOTE>, fancying
him&s;elf in&s;ulted in London, came into the Exchange,
armed and attended with &s;everal &s;ervants. By mi&s;take,
he fell upon a gentleman, whom he took for the per&s;on
that had given him the offence, and having butchered
him with many wounds, he and all his accomplices
took &s;helter in the hou&s;e of the Portugue&s;e amba&s;&s;ador,
<PB N="245" REF="321">
who had connived at this ba&s;e enterprize<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 616.</NOTE>. The po|pulace
&s;urrounded the hou&s;e, and threatened to &s;et it
on fire. Cromwel &s;ent a guard, who &s;eized all the cri|minals.
They were brought to trial: And notwith|&s;tanding
the oppo&s;ition of the amba&s;&s;ador, who pleaded
the privileges of his office, Don Pantaleon was execut|ed
on Tower-hill. The laws of nations were here
plainly violated: But the crime committed by the Por|tugue&s;e
gentleman was to the la&s;t degree atrocious;
and the vigorous cha&s;ti&s;ement of it, &s;uiting &s;o well the
undaunted character of Cromwel, was univer&s;ally ap|proved
at home and admired among foreign nations.
The &s;ituation of Portugal obliged that court to acquie&s;ce;
and the amba&s;&s;ador &s;oon after &s;igned with the Protector
a treaty of peace and alliance, which was very advanta|geous
to the Engli&s;h commerce.</P>
<P>ANOTHER act of &s;everity, but nece&s;&s;ary in his &s;itua|tion,
was, at the very &s;ame time, exerci&s;ed by the Pro|tector,
in the capital puni&s;hment of Gerard and Vowel,
two royali&s;ts, who were accu&s;ed of con&s;piring again&s;t
his life. He had erected a high court of ju&s;tice for their
trial; an infringement of the antient laws, which at
this time was become familiar, but one to which no
cu&s;tom or precedent could reconcile the nation. Juries
were found altogether unmanageable. The re&s;tle&s;s Lil|burn,
for new offences, had been brought to a new
trial; and had been acquitted with new triumph and
exultation. If no other method of conviction had been
devi&s;ed during this illegal and unpopular government,
all its enemies were a&s;&s;ured of entire impunity.</P>
<P>THE Protector had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve the prejudices
entertained again&s;t his government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep|tember. A new par|liament.</NOTE> by the di&s;po&s;ition of
the parliament, which he &s;ummoned on the third of
September, that day of the year, on which he gained
his two great victories of Dunbar and Worce&s;ter, and
<PB N="246" REF="322">
which he always regarded as fortunate for him. It mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, that, if we are left to gather Cromwel's
intentions from his in&s;trument of government, it is &s;uch
a motley piece, that we cannot ea&s;ily conjecture, whe|ther
he &s;eriou&s;ly meant to e&s;tabli&s;h a tyranny or a repub|lic.
On one hand, a fir&s;t magi&s;trate, in &s;o exten|&s;ive
a government, &s;eemed requi&s;ite both for the dignity
and tranquillity of the &s;tate; and the authority, which
he a&s;&s;umed as protector, was, in &s;ome re&s;pects, inferior
to the prerogatives, which the laws entru&s;ted and &s;till
entru&s;t to the King. On the other hand, the legi&s;lative
power, which he re&s;erved to him&s;elf and council, toge|ther
with &s;o great an army, independant of the parlia|ment,
were bad progno&s;tics of his intention to &s;ubmit to
a civil and legal con&s;titution. But if this was not his
intention, the method, in which he di&s;tributed and con|ducted
the elections, being &s;o favourable to liberty, form
an incon&s;i&s;tency which is not ea&s;ily accounted for. He
deprived of their right of election all the &s;mall burroughs,
places much expo&s;ed to influence and corruption. Of
400 members, which repre&s;ented England, 270 were
cho&s;en by the counties. The re&s;t were elected by Lon|don,
and the more con&s;iderable corporations. The
lower populace too, &s;o ea&s;ily guided or deceived, were
excluded from the elections: An e&s;tate of 200 pounds
value was requi&s;ite to entitle any one to a vote. The
elections of this parliament were conducted with perfect
freedom; and, excepting that &s;uch of the royali&s;ts as had
borne arms again&s;t the parliament and all their &s;ons
were excluded, a more fair repre&s;entation of the people
could not be de&s;ired nor expected. Thirty members
were returned from Scotland; as many from Ireland.</P>
<P>THE Protector &s;eems to have been di&s;appointed, when
he found, that all the&s;e precautions, which were pro|bably
nothing but covers to his ambition, had not pro|cured
him the confidence of the public. Though Crom|wel's
<PB N="247" REF="323">
admini&s;tration was le&s;s odious to every party than
that of any other party, yet was it entirely acceptable to
none of them. The royali&s;ts had been in&s;tructed by
the King to remain quiet, and to cover them&s;elves un|der
the appearance of republicans; and they found in
this latter faction &s;uch inveterate hatred again&s;t the Pro|tector,
that they could not wi&s;h for more zealous adver|&s;aries
to his authority. It was maintained by them, that
the pretence of liberty and popular election was but a
new artifice of this grand deceiver, in order to lay a&s;leep
the deluded nation, and give him&s;elf lei&s;ure to rivet their
chains more &s;ecurely upon them: That in the in&s;tru|ment
of government he openly declared his intention of
&s;till retaining the &s;ame mercenary army, by who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
he had &s;ubdued the antient, e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment,
and who would with le&s;s &s;cruple obey him, in
overturning, whenever he &s;hould plea&s;e to order them,
that new &s;y&s;tem, which he him&s;elf had been plea&s;ed to
model: That being &s;en&s;ible of the danger and uncer|tainty
of all military government, he endeavoured to in|termix
&s;ome appearance, and but an appearance, of ci|vil
admini&s;tration, and to ballance the army by a &s;eem|ing
con&s;ent of the people: That the ab&s;urd trial, which
he had made of a parliament, elected by him&s;elf, ap|pointed
perpetually to elect their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, plainly
proved, that he aimed at nothing but temporary expe|dients,
was totally aver&s;e to a free republican govern|ment,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed not that mature and deliberate re|flection,
which could qualify him to act the part of a
legi&s;lator: That his imperious character, which had be|trayed
it&s;elf in &s;o many incidents, would never &s;eriou&s;ly
&s;ubmit to legal limitations; nor would the very image
of popular government be longer upheld than while it
was conformable to his arbitrary will and plea&s;ure: And
that the be&s;t policy was to oblige him to take off the
ma&s;k at once; and either &s;ubmit entirely to that parlia|ment

which he had &s;ummoned, or by totally rejecting
its authority, leave him&s;elf no re&s;ource but his &s;editious
and enthu&s;ia&s;tic army.</P>
<P>IN pro&s;ecution of the&s;e views, the parliament, hav|ing
heard the Protector's &s;peech three hours long<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 588.</NOTE>, and
having cho&s;en Lenthal for their &s;peaker, immediately
entered into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the pretended in&s;trument of
government, and of that authority, which Cromwel,
under the title of Protector, had a&s;&s;umed over the nation.
The greate&s;t liberty was u&s;ed in arraigning this new
dignity; and even the per&s;onal character and conduct of
Cromwel e&s;caped not altogether without cen&s;ure. The
utmo&s;t, which could be obtained by the officers and by
the court party, for &s;o they were called, was to pro|tract
the debate by arguments and long &s;peeches, and
prevent the deci&s;ion of a que&s;tion, which, they were
&s;en&s;ible, would be carried again&s;t them by a great majo|rity.
The Protector, &s;urpri&s;ed and enraged at this re|fractory
&s;pirit in the parliament, which however he
had &s;o much rea&s;on to expect, &s;ent for them to the
Painted Chamber, and with an air of great authority in|veighed
again&s;t their conduct. He told them, that no|thing
could be more ab&s;urd than for them to di&s;pute his
title; &s;ince the &s;ame in&s;trument of government, which
made them a parliament, had inve&s;ted him with the
Protector&s;hip; that &s;ome points in the new con&s;titution
were &s;uppo&s;ed to be fundamentals, and were not, on
any pretence, to be altered or di&s;puted; that among
the&s;e were the government of the nation by one per&s;on
and a parliament, their joint authority over the army
and militia, the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new parliaments, and li|berty
of con&s;cience; and that, with regard to the&s;e par|ticulars,
there was re&s;erved to him a negative voice, to
which, in the other circum&s;tances of government, he
confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf no wi&s;e intitled.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="327">
THE Protector now found him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to ex|act
a &s;ecurity, which, had he fore&s;een the &s;pirit of the
hou&s;e, he would with much better grace have required
at their fir&s;t meeting<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 620.</NOTE>. He obliged the members to
&s;ign a recognition of his authority, and an engagement
not to propo&s;e or con&s;ent to any alteration of the go|vernment,
as it was &s;ettled in one &s;ingle per&s;on and a
parliament; and he placed guards at the door of the
hou&s;e, who allowed none but &s;ub&s;cribers to enter. Mo&s;t
of the members, after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;ubmitted to this
condition; but retained the &s;ame refractory &s;pirit, which
they had di&s;covered in their fir&s;t debates. The in&s;tru|ment
of government was taken in pieces, and examined,
one article after another, with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous ac|curacy:
Very free topics were advanced with the gene|ral
approbation of the hou&s;e: And during the whole
cour&s;e of their tran&s;actions, they neither &s;ent up one
law to the Protector, nor took any notice of him. Be|ing
informed, that con&s;piracies were entered into be|tween
the members and &s;ome malecontent officers of the
army; he ha&s;tened to a di&s;&s;olution of &s;o dangerous an
a&s;&s;embly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1655.</NOTE> By the in&s;trument of government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> to which
he had &s;worn, no parliament could be di&s;&s;olved, till it
had &s;ate five months; but Cromwel pretended, that a
month contained only twenty-eight days, according to
the method of computation practi&s;ed in paying the fleet
and army. The full time, therefore, according to this
reckoning, being elap&s;ed; the parliament was ordered
to attend the Protector, where he made them a tedious,
confu&s;ed, angry harangue, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them. Were
we to judge of Cromwel's capacity by this, and indeed
by all his other compo&s;itions, we &s;hould be apt to en|tertain
no very favourable idea of it. But in the great
variety of human geniu&s;es, there are &s;ome, which, tho'
they &s;ee their object clearly and di&s;tinctly in general;

yet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXI.</NOTE> when they come to unfold its parts by di&s;cour&s;e or
writing, lo&s;e that luminous conception, which they had
before attained. All accounts agree in a&s;cribing to
Cromwel a tire&s;ome, dark, unintelligible elocution,
even when he had no intention to di&s;gui&s;e his mean|ing:
Yet no man's actions were ever, in &s;uch a variety
of difficult incidents, more deci&s;ive and judicious.</P>
<P>THE electing a di&s;contented parliament is a &s;ure
proof of a di&s;contented nation: The angry and abrupt
di&s;&s;olution of that parliament is &s;ure always to encrea&s;e
the general di&s;content. The members of this a&s;&s;embly,
returning to their counties, propagated that &s;pirit of
mutiny, which they had exerted in the hou&s;e. Sir
Harry Vane, and the old republicans, who maintained
the indi&s;&s;oluble authority of the long parliament, en|couraged
the murmurs again&s;t the pre&s;ent u&s;urpation;
though they acted &s;o cautiou&s;ly as to give the Protector
no handle again&s;t them. Wildman and &s;ome others of
that party carried &s;till farther their con&s;piracies again&s;t
the Protector's authority. The royali&s;ts, ob&s;erving this
general ill will towards the e&s;tabli&s;hment, could no
longer be retained in &s;ubjection; but fancied, that every
one, who was di&s;&s;atisfied like them, had al&s;o embraced
the &s;ame views and inclinations. They did not con&s;ider,
that all the old parliamentary party, though many of
them were di&s;plea&s;ed with Cromwel, who had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
them of their power, were &s;till more apprehen&s;ive of any
&s;ucce&s;s to the royal cau&s;e; whence, be&s;ides a certain
pro&s;pect of the &s;ame inconvenience, they had &s;o much
rea&s;on to dread the &s;evere&s;t vengeance for their pa&s;t
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IN concert with the King a con&s;piracy was entered
into by the royali&s;ts throughout England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection of the roya|li&s;ts.</NOTE> and a day of
general ri&s;ing appointed. Information of this de&s;ign
was conveyed to Cromwel. The Protector's admini&s;tra|tion
was extremely vigilant. Thurloe, his &s;ecretary, had
<PB N="251" REF="331">
&s;pies every where. Manning, who had acce&s;s to the
King's family, kept a regular corre&s;pondence with him.
And it was not difficult to obtain intelligence of a con|federacy,
&s;o generally diffu&s;ed among a party, who va|lued
them&s;elves more on zeal and courage, than on &s;e|crecy
and &s;obriety. Many of the royali&s;ts were thrown
into pri&s;on. Others, on the approach of the day, were
terrified with the danger of the undertaking, and re|mained
at home. In one place alone the con&s;piracy
broke out into action.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of March.</NOTE> Penruddoc, Groves, Jones, and
other gentlemen of the we&s;t, entered Sali&s;bury with
about 200 hor&s;e; at the very time when the &s;heriff and
judges were holding the a&s;&s;izes. The&s;e they made pri|&s;oners;
and they proclaimed the King. Contrary to
their expectations, they received no acce&s;&s;ion of force;
&s;o prevalent was the terror of the e&s;tabli&s;hed govern|ment.
Having in vain wandered about for &s;ome time,
they were totally di&s;couraged; and one troop of hor&s;e
was able at la&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s them. The leaders of the
con&s;piracy, being taken pri&s;oners, were capitally puni&s;h|ed.
The re&s;t were &s;old for &s;laves, and tran&s;ported to
Barbadoes.</P>
<P>THE ea&s;y &s;ubduing this in&s;urrection, which, by the
boldne&s;s of the undertaking, &s;truck at fir&s;t an infinite
terror into the nation, was a &s;ingular felicity to the Pro|tector,
who could not, without danger, have brought
together any con&s;iderable body of his mutinous army,
in order to &s;uppre&s;s it. The very in&s;urrection it&s;elf he
regarded as a fortunate event; &s;ince it proved the reality
of tho&s;e con&s;piracies, which his enemies, on every oc|ca&s;ion,
repre&s;ented as mere fictions, invented to colour
his jealous &s;everities. He re&s;olved to keep no longer any
terms with the royali&s;ts, who, though they were not
perhaps the mo&s;t implacable of his enemies, were tho&s;e
whom he could oppre&s;s under the mo&s;t plau&s;ible pre|tences,
and who met with lea&s;t countenance and pro|tection
<PB N="252" REF="332">
from his adherents. He i&s;&s;ued an edict with the
con&s;ent of his council, for exacting the tenth penny from
that whole party; in order, as he pretended, to make
them pay the expences, to which their mutinous di&s;po|&s;ition
continually expo&s;ed the public. Without regard
to compo&s;itions, articles of capitulation, or acts of in|demnity,
all the royali&s;ts, however harra&s;&s;ed with former
expences and oppre&s;&s;ions, were obliged anew to re|deem
them&s;elves by great &s;ums of money; and many of
them were reduced by the&s;e multiplied di&s;a&s;ters to ex|treme
poverty. Whoever was known to be di&s;affected,
or even lay under any &s;u&s;picion, though no guilt could
be proved again&s;t him, was expo&s;ed to this exaction.</P>
<P>IN order to rai&s;e an impo&s;ition, &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and ini|quitous,
the Protector in&s;tituted ten<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 88. Mo&s;t hi&s;torians &s;ay, that the major-generals were eleven: Dugdale and Bates fourteen.</NOTE> major-generals;
and divided the whole kingdom of England into &s;o
many military juri&s;dictions. The&s;e men, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
commi&s;&s;ioners, had power to &s;ubject whom they plea&s;ed
to decimation, to levy all the taxes impo&s;ed by the Pro|tector
and his council, and to impri&s;on any per&s;on who
&s;hould be expo&s;ed to their jealou&s;y or &s;u&s;picion; nor
was there any appeal from them but to the Protector
him&s;elf and his council. Under colour of the&s;e powers,
which were &s;ufficiently exorbitant, the major-generals
exerci&s;ed an authority &s;till more arbitrary, and acted as
if ab&s;olute ma&s;ters of the property and per&s;on of every
&s;ubject. All rea&s;onable men now concluded, that the
very ma&s;que of liberty was thrown a&s;ide, and that the
nation was for ever &s;ubjected to military and de&s;potic
government, exerci&s;ed not in the legal manner of Euro|pean
nations, but according to the maxims of ea&s;tern
tyranny. Not only the &s;upreme magi&s;trate owed his
authority to illegal force and u&s;urpation: He had
parcelled out the people into &s;o many &s;ubdivi&s;ions of
<PB N="253" REF="333">
&s;lavery, and had delegated to his inferior mini&s;ters the
&s;ame unlimited authority, which he him&s;elf had &s;o vio|lently
a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>A GOVERNMENT, totally military and de&s;potic, is
&s;ure, after &s;ome time, to fall into impotence and lan|guor:
But when it immediately &s;ucceeds a legal con&s;ti|tution,
it may, at fir&s;t, to foreign nations appear very vi|gorous
and active, and exert with more unanimity that
power, &s;pirit, and riches, which had been acquired un|der
a better form of government. It &s;eems now proper,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Eu|rope.</NOTE>
after &s;o long an interval, to llok abroad to the general
&s;tate of Europe, and to con&s;ider the mea&s;ures, which
England, at this time, embraced in its negotiations with
the neighbouring princes. The moderate temper and un|warlike
genius of the two la&s;t princes, the extreme dif|ficulties
under which they laboured at home, and the
great &s;ecurity which they enjoyed from foreign enemies,
had rendered them very negligent of the tran&s;actions of
the continent; and England, during their reigns, had
been in a manner overlooked in the general &s;y&s;tem of
Europe. The bold and re&s;tle&s;s genius of the Protector
led him to extend his alliances and enterprizes to every
corner of Chri&s;tendom; and partly from the a&s;cendant of
his magnanimous &s;pirit, partly from the &s;ituation of fo|reign
kingdoms, the weight of England, even under its
mo&s;t legal and brave&s;t princes, was never more &s;en&s;ibly
felt than during this unju&s;t and violent u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>A WAR of thirty years, the mo&s;t &s;ignal and mo&s;t de|&s;tructive
which had appeared in modern annals, was at
la&s;t fini&s;hed in Germany<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">In 1648.</NOTE>; and by the treaty of We&s;t|phalia,
were compo&s;ed tho&s;e fatal quarrels, which had
been excited by the Palatine's precipitant acceptance of
the crown of Bohemia. The young Palatine was re|&s;tored
to a part of his dignities and of his dominions:
<PB N="254" REF="334">
The rights, privileges, and authority of the &s;everal mem|bers
of the Germanic body were fixed and a&s;certained:
Sovereign princes and free &s;tates were in &s;ome degree re|duced
to obedience under laws: And by the valour of
the heroic Gu&s;tavus, the enterprizes of the active Riche|lieu,
the intrigues of the artful Mazarine, was in part
effected, after an infinite expence of blood and trea|&s;ure,
what had been expected and demanded from the
feeble efforts of the pacific James, &s;econded by the &s;canty
&s;upplies of his jealous parliaments.</P>
<P>SWEDEN, which had acquired by conque&s;t very large
dominions in the north of Germany, was engaged in
enterprizes, which promi&s;ed her, from her &s;ucce&s;s and
valour, &s;till more exten&s;ive acqui&s;itions on the &s;ide both
of Poland and of Denmark. Charles the tenth, who
had mounted the throne of that kingdom after the vo|luntary
re&s;ignation of Chri&s;tina, being &s;timulated by
the &s;ame of the great Gu&s;tavus as well as by his own
martial di&s;po&s;ition, carried his conquering arms to the
&s;outh of the Baltic, and gained the celebrated victory of
War&s;aw, which had been ob&s;tinately conte&s;ted during
the &s;pace of three days. The Protector, at the time
his alliance was courted by every power in Europe,
anxiou&s;ly courted the alliance of Sweden; and he was
fond of forming a confederacy with a prote&s;tant power
of &s;uch renown, even tho' it threatened the whole north
with conque&s;t and &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THE tran&s;actions of the parliament and Protector with
France had been various and complicated. The emi&s;|&s;aries
of Richelieu had furni&s;hed fuel to the flame of re|bellion,
when it fir&s;t broke out in Scotland; but after
the conflagration had diffu&s;ed it&s;elf, the French court,
ob&s;erving the materials to be of them&s;elves &s;ufficiently
combu&s;tible, found it unnece&s;&s;ary any longer to animate
the Briti&s;h malecontents to an oppo&s;ition of their So|vereign.
<PB N="255" REF="335">
On the contrary, they offered their mediation
for compo&s;ing the&s;e inte&s;tine di&s;orders; and their am|ba&s;&s;adors,
from decency, pretended to act in concert
with the court of England, and to receive directions
from a prince, with whom their ma&s;ter was connected
by &s;o near an affinity. Meanwhile, Richelieu died, and
&s;oon after him, the French King, Louis the thirteenth;
leaving his &s;on an infant four years old, and his widow,
Anne of Au&s;tria, regent of the kingdom. Cardinal Ma|zarine
&s;ucceeded Richelieu in the mini&s;try; and the &s;ame
general plan of admini&s;tration, tho' by men of &s;uch op|po&s;ite
characters, was &s;till continued in the French
councils. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of royal authority, the re|duction
of the Au&s;trian family, were pur&s;ued with ardor
and &s;ucce&s;s; and every year brought an acce&s;&s;ion of force
and grandeur to the French monarchy. Not only
battles were gained, towns and fortre&s;&s;es taken; the ge|nius
too of the nation &s;eemed gradually to improve,
and to compo&s;e it&s;elf to the &s;pirit of dutiful obedience
and of &s;teddy enterprize. A Cond&eacute;, a Turenne were
formed; and the troops animated by their valour, and
guided by their di&s;cipline, acquired every day a greater
a&s;cendant over the Spaniards. All of a &s;udden, from
&s;ome intrigues of the court, and &s;ome di&s;contents in the
courts of judicature, inte&s;tine commotions were excited,
and every thing relap&s;ed into confu&s;ion. But the&s;e re|bellions
of the French, neither ennobled by the &s;pirit of
liberty, nor di&s;graced by the fanatical extravagancies,
which di&s;tingui&s;hed the Briti&s;h civil wars, were con|ducted
with little blood&s;hed, and made but &s;mall im|pre&s;&s;ion
on the minds of the people. Tho' &s;econded by
the force of Spain, and conducted by the heroic Cond&eacute;,
the malecontents, in a little time, were either expelled
or &s;ubdued; and the French monarchy, having lo&s;t a
few of its conque&s;ts, returned again, with fre&s;h vigor,
to the acqui&s;ition of new dominion.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="336">
THE Queen of England and her &s;on, Charles, during
the&s;e commotions, pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of their time at Paris;
and notwith&s;tanding their near connexion of blood, re|ceived
but few civilities, and &s;till le&s;s &s;upport, from the
French court. Had the Queen regent been ever &s;o much
inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Engli&s;h Prince; the di&s;orders of her
own affairs, for a long time, would have rendered &s;uch
intentions ab&s;olutely impracticable. The bani&s;hed Queen
had a moderate pen&s;ion a&s;&s;igned her; but it was &s;o ill
payed, and her credit ran &s;o low, that, one morning,
when the Cardinal de Retz waited on her, &s;he informed
him, that her daughter, the Prince&s;s Henrietta, was ob|liged
to lie abed, for want of a fire to warm her. To
&s;uch a condition was reduced, in the mid&s;t of Paris, a
Queen of England, and daughter of Henry the fourth of
France!</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h Parliament, however, having a&s;&s;umed
the &s;overeignty of the &s;tate, re&s;ented the countenance,
cold as it was, which the French court gave to the un|fortunate
Monarch. On pretence of injuries, of which
the Engli&s;h merchants complained, they i&s;&s;ued letters of
repri&s;al upon the French; and Blake went &s;o far as to
attack and &s;eize a whole &s;quadron of &s;hips, which were
carrying &s;upplies to Dunkirk, then clo&s;ely be&s;ieged by
the Spaniards. That town, di&s;appointed of the&s;e &s;up|plies,
fell into the enemies hands. The court of France
&s;oon found it requi&s;ite to change their mea&s;ures. They
treated Charles with &s;uch affected indifference, that he
thought it more decent to withdraw, and to &s;ave him|&s;elf
the &s;hame of being de&s;ired to leave the kingdom.
He went fir&s;t to Spaw, thence he retired to Cologne;
where he lived two years, on a &s;mall pen&s;ion, about
6000 pounds a year, payed him by the French Mo|narch,
and on &s;ome contributions &s;ent him by his friends
in England. In the management of his family, he di&s;|covered
a di&s;po&s;ition to order and oeconomy; and his
<PB N="257" REF="337">
temper, cheerful, carele&s;s, and &s;ociable, was more than
a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation for that empire, of which his
enemies had bereaved him. Sir Edward Hyde, created
Lord-chancellor, and the Marque&s;s of Ormond, were
his chief friends and confidents.</P>
<P>IF the French mini&s;try had thought it prudent to bend
under the Engli&s;h parliament, they deemed it &s;till more
nece&s;&s;ary to pay deference to the Protector, when he
a&s;&s;umed the reins of government. Cardinal Mazarine,
by whom all the French councils were directed, was
artful and vigilant, &s;upple and patient, fal&s;e and in|triguing;
de&s;irous rather to prevail by dexterity than
violence, and placing his honour more in the final &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his mea&s;ures than in the &s;plendor and magnani|mity
of the means which he employed. Cromwel, by
his imperious character, rather than by the advantage of
his &s;ituation, acquired an a&s;cendant over this man; and
each propo&s;al made by the Protector, however unrea&s;on|able
in it&s;elf and urged with whatever in&s;olence, met
with a ready compliance from the politic and timid car|dinal.
Boardeaux was &s;ent over to England as mini&s;|ter;
and every circum&s;tance of re&s;pect was payed to the
daring u&s;urper, who had embrued his hands in the blood
of his &s;overeign, a Prince &s;o nearly related to the crown
of France. With indefatigable patience did Bourdeaux
conduct this negotiation, which Cromwel &s;eemed en|tirely
to neglect; and tho' privateers with Engli&s;h com|mi&s;&s;ions,
committed daily ravages on the French com|merce,
Mazarine was contented, in hopes of a fortu|nate
i&s;&s;ue, &s;till to &s;ubmit to the&s;e indignities<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, Vol. iii. p. 103, 619, 653.

the French monarchy, had been &s;till more forward in
their advances to the pro&s;perous parliament and pro|tector.
Don Alonzo de Cardenas, the Spani&s;h envoy,
was the fir&s;t public mini&s;ter, who recognized the autho|rity
of the new republic; and in return of this civility,
A&s;cham was &s;ent envoy into Spain by the parliament.
No &s;ooner had this mini&s;ter arrived in Madrid, than
&s;ome of the bani&s;hed royali&s;ts, inflamed by that inve|terate
hatred, which animated the Engli&s;h factions, broke
into his chamber, and murdered him together with his
&s;ecretary. Immediately, they took &s;anctuary in the
churches, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the general favour, which every
where attended the royal cau&s;e, were enabled, mo&s;t of
them, to make their e&s;cape. Only one of the criminals
&s;uffered death; and the parliament &s;eemed to re&s;t con|tented
with this atonement.</P>
<P>SPAIN, at this time, a&s;&s;ailed every where by vigorous
enemies from without, and labouring under many inter|nal
di&s;orders, retained nothing of her former grandeur,
except the haughty pride of her councils, and the ha|tred
and jealou&s;y of all her neighbours. Portugal had re|volted,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed its monarchy in the hou&s;e of Bra|ganza:
Catalonia, complaining of violated privileges,
had delivered it&s;elf over to France: Naples was &s;hook
with popular convul&s;ions: The Low Countries were in|vaded
with &s;uperior forces, and &s;eemed ready to change
their ma&s;ter: The Spani&s;h infantry, antiently &s;o for|midable,
had been annihilated by Cond&eacute; in the fields of
Rocroy: and tho' the &s;ame Prince, bani&s;hed France,
&s;u&s;tained by his activity and valour, the falling fortunes
of Spain, he could only hope to protract, not prevent,
the ruin, with which that monarchy was vi&s;ibly threat|ned.</P>
<P>HAD Cromwel under&s;tood and regarded the intere&s;t
of his country, he would have &s;upported the declining
<PB N="259" REF="341">
condition of Spain again&s;t the dangerous ambition of
France, and pre&s;erved that ballance of power, on which
the greatne&s;s and &s;ecurity of England &s;o much depends.
Had he &s;tudied only his own intere&s;ts, he would have
maintained an exact neutrality between tho&s;e two great
monarchies; nor would he ever have hazarded his ill-acquired
and un&s;ettled power, by provoking foreign
enemies, who might lend a&s;&s;i&s;tance to dome&s;tic faction,
and overturn his tottering throne. But his magnanimity
undervalued danger: His active di&s;po&s;ition and avidity
of exten&s;ive glory, made him incapable of repo&s;e: And
as the policy of men is continually warped by their tem|per,
no &s;ooner was peace made with Holland, than he
began to deliberate what new enemy he &s;hould invade
with his victorious arms.</P>
<P>THE exten&s;ive dominion and yet extreme weakne&s;s of
Spain in the We&s;t Indies;<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with Spain.</NOTE> the vigorous courage and
great naval power of England; were circum&s;tances,
which, when compared, excited the ambition of the
enterprizing Protector, and made him hope, that he
might, by &s;ome gainful conque&s;t, render for ever illu&s;|trious
that dominion, which he had a&s;&s;umed over his
country. Should he fail of the&s;e durable acqui&s;itions,
the Indian trea&s;ures, which mu&s;t every year cro&s;s the
ocean to reach Spain, were, he thought, a &s;ure prey to
the Engli&s;h navy, and would &s;upport his military force,
without laying new burthens on the di&s;contented peo|ple.
From France a vigorous re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t be ex|pected:
No plunder, no conque&s;ts could be hoped for.
The progre&s;s of his arms, even if attended with &s;ucce&s;s,
mu&s;t there be &s;low and gradual; and the advantages ac|quired,
however real, would be le&s;s &s;triking to the igno|rant
multitude, whom it was his intere&s;t to allure. The
royal family, &s;o clo&s;ely connected with the French mo|narch,
might receive great a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that neigh|bouring
kingdom; and an army of French prote&s;tants,

ACTUATED equally by tho&s;e bigotted, tho&s;e ambiti|ous,
and tho&s;e intere&s;ted motives, the Protector equip|ped
two con&s;iderable &s;quadrons; and while he was mak|ing
the&s;e preparations, all the neighbouring nations, ig|norant
of his intentions, remained in &s;u&s;pence, and
looked with anxious expectation on what &s;ide the &s;torm
would di&s;charge it&s;elf. One of the &s;quadrons, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of thirty capital &s;hips, was &s;ent into the Mediterra|nean
under Blake, who&s;e fame was now &s;pread over all
Europe. No Engli&s;h fleet, except during the Croi&s;ades,
had ever before &s;ailed tho&s;e &s;eas; and from one extre|mity
to the other, there was no naval force, Chri&s;tian
or Mahometan, able to re&s;i&s;t them. The Roman pon|tiff,
who&s;e weakne&s;s and who&s;e pride, equally provoke
attacks, dreaded inva&s;ion from a power, which profe&s;&s;ed
the mo&s;t inveterate enmity again&s;t him, and which
&s;o little regulated its movements by the common motives
of intere&s;t and prudence. Blake, ca&s;ting anchor before
Leghorn, demanded and obtained of the Duke of Tu&s;|cany
&s;atisfaction for &s;ome lo&s;&s;es, which the Engli&s;h com|merce
had formerly &s;u&s;tained from him. He next &s;ailed
to Algiers, and compelled the Dey to make peace, and
to re&s;train his pyratical &s;ubjects from all farther violences
on the Engli&s;h. He pre&s;ented him&s;elf before Tunis,
and having made the &s;ame demands, the Dey of that re|public
bade him look to the ca&s;tles of Porto-Farino and
Goletta, and do his utmo&s;t. Blake needed not to be
rouzed by &s;uch a bravado: He drew his &s;hips clo&s;e up
to the ca&s;tles, and tore them in pieces with his artillery.
He &s;ent a numerous detachment of &s;eamen in their long
boats into the harbour, and burned every &s;hip which
lay there. This bold action, which its very temerity,
perhaps, rendered &s;afe, was executed with very little
lo&s;s, and filled all that part of the world with the re|nown
of Engli&s;h valour.</P>

THE other &s;quadron was not equally &s;ucce&s;sful. It
was commanded by Pen, and carried on board 4000
men, under the command of Venables. About 5000

enterprize, may ju&s;tly be a&s;cribed, as much to the in|judicious
contrivance of the Protector, who planned it,
as to the bad execution of the officers, by whom it was
conducted. The &s;oldiers were the refu&s;e of the whole

with arms fit for &s;uch an expedition: Their pro|vi&s;ions
were very defective both in quantity and quality:
All hopes of pillage, the be&s;t incentive to valour among
&s;uch men, were refu&s;ed the &s;oldiers and &s;eamen: No
directions nor intelligence were given to conduct the
officers in their enterprize: And at the &s;ame time, they
were tied down to follow the advice of commi&s;&s;ioners,
who extremely di&s;concerted them in all their projects<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burchet's Naval Hi&s;tory. See al&s;o Carte's Collection, vol. ii. p. 46, 47. Thurloe, vol. iii. p. 505.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT was agreed by the Admiral and General to attempt
St. Domingo,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of April.</NOTE> the only place of &s;trength in the i&s;land of
Hi&s;paniola. On the approach of the Engli&s;h the Spa|niards
in a fright de&s;erted their hou&s;es, and fled into the
woods. Contrary to the opinion of Venables, the &s;ol|diers
were di&s;embarked without guides ten leagues di&s;|tant
from the town. They wandered four days through
the woods without provi&s;ions, and what was &s;till more
intolerable in that &s;ultry climate, without water. The
<PB N="263" REF="347">
Spaniards gathered courage, and attacked them. The Eng|li&s;h,
di&s;couraged with the bad conduct of their officers,
and &s;carce alive from hunger, thir&s;t, and fatigue, had
no &s;pirit to re&s;i&s;t. A very incon&s;iderable number of the
enemy put the whole army to rout, killed 600 of them,
and chaced the re&s;t on board their ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h commanders, in order to atone, if po&s;|&s;ible,
for this unpro&s;perous attempt, bent their cour&s;e
to Jamaica, which was &s;urrendered to them without a
blow. Pen and Venables returned to England, and
were both of them &s;ent to the Tower by the Protector,
who, though commonly ma&s;ter of his fiery temper, was
thrown into a violent pa&s;&s;ion at this di&s;appointment. He
had made a conque&s;t of much greater importance, than
he was him&s;elf at that time aware of; yet was it much
inferior to the va&s;t projects, which he had formed. He
gave orders, however, to &s;upport it by men and money;
and that i&s;land has ever &s;ince remained in the hands of
the Engli&s;h; the chief acqui&s;ition which they owe to
the enterprizing &s;pirit of Cromwel.</P>
<P>AS &s;oon as the news of this enterprize,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1656.</NOTE> which was a
mo&s;t unwarrantable violation of treaty, arrived in Eu|rope,
the Spaniards declared war again&s;t England, and
&s;eized all the &s;hips and goods of Engli&s;h merchants, of
which they could make them&s;elves ma&s;ters. The Spa|ni&s;h
commerce, &s;o profitable to the nation, was cut off;
and near 1500 ve&s;&s;els, it is computed<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 135. World's Mi&s;take in Oliver Cromwel, in the Harl. Mi&s;cel. vol. i.</NOTE>, fell in a few
years into the hands of the enemy. Blake, to whom
Montague was now joined in command, after receiving
new orders, prepared him&s;elf for ho&s;tilities again&s;t the
Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="264" REF="348">
SEVERAL &s;ea officers, having entertained &s;cruples of
con&s;cience with regard to the ju&s;tice of the Spani&s;h war,
threw up their commi&s;&s;ions, and retired home<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 570. 589.</NOTE>. No
command, they thought, of their &s;uperiors could ju&s;tify
a war, which was contrary to the principles of natural
equity, and which the civil magi&s;trate had no right to
order. Individuals, they maintained, in re&s;igning to
the public their natural liberty, could be&s;tow on it only
what they them&s;elves were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, a right of per|forming
lawful actions, and could inve&s;t it with no au|thority
of commanding what is contrary to the decrees
of heaven. Such maxims, though they &s;eem rea&s;onable,
are perhaps too perfect for human nature, and mu&s;t be
regarded as one effect, though of the mo&s;t innocent and
even honourable kind, of that &s;pirit, partly fanatical,
partly republican, which predominated in England.</P>
<P>BLAKE lay &s;ome time off Cadiz,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Succe&s;s.</NOTE> in expectation of
intercepting the plate fleet, but was at la&s;t obliged, for
want of water, to make &s;ail towards Portugal. Cap|tain
Stayner, whom he had left on the coa&s;t with a
&s;quadron of &s;even ve&s;&s;els, came in &s;ight of the galleons,
and immediately &s;et &s;ail to pur&s;ue them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">September.</NOTE> The Spani&s;h
admiral ran his &s;hip a&s;hore: Two others followed his
example: The Engli&s;h took two &s;hips valued at near
two millions of pieces of eight. Two galleons were &s;et
on fire; and the Marque&s;s of Bajadox, Viceroy of Peru,
with his wife and his daughter, betrothed to the young
Duke of Medina Celi, were de&s;troyed in them. The
Marque&s;s him&s;elf might have e&s;caped; but &s;eeing the&s;e
unfortunate women, a&s;toni&s;hed with the danger, fall
in a &s;woon, and peri&s;h in the flames, he cho&s;e rather to
die with them than drag out a life, embittered with
the remembrance of the&s;e di&s;mal &s;cenes<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. v. p. 433.</NOTE>. When the
trea&s;ures, gained by this enterprize, arrived at Port&s;|mouth,
<PB N="265" REF="349">
the Protector, from a &s;pirit of o&s;tentation, or|dered
them to be tran&s;ported by land to London.</P>
<P>THE next action again&s;t the Spaniards was more glo|rious,
though le&s;s profitable to the nation. Blake, hav|ing
heard that a Spani&s;h fleet of &s;ixteen &s;hips, much
richer than the former, had taken &s;helter in the Cana|ries,
immediately made &s;ail towards them. He found
them in the bay of Santa Cruz, di&s;po&s;ed in a mo&s;t for|midable
po&s;ture. The bay was &s;ecured with a &s;trong
ca&s;tle, well fortified with cannon, be&s;ides &s;even forts in
&s;everal parts of it, all united by a line of communica|tion,
manned with mu&s;queteers. Don Diego Diagues,
the Spani&s;h admiral, ordered all his &s;maller ve&s;&s;els to
moor clo&s;e to the &s;hore, and po&s;ted the larger galleons
farther off, at anchor, with their broad&s;ides to the
&s;ea.</P>
<P>BLAKE was rather animated than daunted with this
appearance. The wind &s;econded his courage, and
blowing full into the bay, in a moment brought him
among the thicke&s;t of his enemies. After a re&s;i&s;tance
of four hours, the Spaniards yielded to the Engli&s;h va|lour,
and abandoned their &s;hips, which were &s;et on
fire, and con&s;umed with all their trea&s;ures. The
greate&s;t danger &s;till remained to the Engli&s;h. They lay
under the fire of the ca&s;tles and all the forts, which mu&s;t,
in a little time, have torn them in pieces. But the wind
&s;uddenly &s;hifting, carried them out of the bay; where
they left the Spaniards in a&s;toni&s;hment at the happy te|merity
of their audacious victors.</P>
<P>THIS was the la&s;t and greate&s;t action of the gallant
Blake.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and death of admiral Blake.</NOTE> He was con&s;umed with a drop&s;y and &s;curvy,
and ha&s;tened home, that he might yield up his la&s;t
breath in his native country, which he &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately
$oved, and which he had &s;o much adorned by his valour.
As he came within &s;ight of land, he expired<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">20th of April, 1657.</NOTE>. Never
<PB N="266" REF="350">
man, &s;o zealous for a faction, was &s;o much re&s;pected
and e&s;teemed even by the oppo&s;ite factions. He was by
principle an inflexible Republican; and the late u&s;urpa|tions,
amid&s;t all the tru&s;t and care&s;&s;es which he received
from the ruling powers, were thought to be very little
grateful to him. <HI>It is &s;till our duty,</HI> he &s;aid to the &s;ea|men,
<HI>to fight for our country, into whatever hands the go|vernment
may fall.</HI> Di&s;intere&s;ted, generous, liberal;
ambitious only of true glory, dreadful only to his
avowed enemies; he forms one of the mo&s;t perfect
characters of that age, and the lea&s;t &s;tained with tho&s;e
errors and violences, which were then &s;o predominant.
The Protector ordered him a pompous funeral at the
public charge: But the tears of his countrymen were
the mo&s;t honourable panegyric on his memory.</P>
<P>THE conduct of the protector in foreign affairs, tho'
imprudent and impolitic, was full of vigor and enter|prize,
and drew a con&s;ideration to his country, which,
&s;ince the reign of Elizabeth, it &s;eemed to have totally
lo&s;t. The great mind of this &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urper was in|tent
on &s;preading the renown of the Engli&s;h name; and
while he &s;truck mankind with a&s;toni&s;hment at his extra|ordinary
fortune, he &s;eemed to ennoble, in&s;tead of de|ba&s;ing,
that people, whom he had reduced to &s;ubjec|tion.
It was his boa&s;t, that he would render the name
of an Engli&s;hman as much feared and revered as ever
was that of a Roman; and as his countrymen found
&s;ome reality in the&s;e preten&s;ions, their national vanity,
being gratified, made them bear with the more patience
all the indignities and calamities under which they la|boured.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t al&s;o be acknowledged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dome&s;tic admini&s;tra|tion of Cromwel.</NOTE> that the Protector, in
his civil and dome&s;tic admini&s;tration, di&s;played as great
regard both to ju&s;tice and clemency, as his u&s;urped au|thority,
derived from no law, and founded only on the
&s;word, could po&s;&s;ibly permit. All the chief offices in the
<PB N="267" REF="351">
courts of judicature were filled with men of integrity:
Amid&s;t the virulence of faction, the decrees of the
judges were upright and impartial: And to every man
but him&s;elf, and to him&s;elf, except where nece&s;&s;ity re|quired
the contrary, the law was the great rule of con|duct
and behaviour. Vane and Lilburn, who&s;e credit
with the republicans and levellers he dreaded, were in|deed
for &s;ome time confined to pri&s;on: Cony, who re|fu&s;ed
to pay illegal taxes, was obliged by menaces to
depart from his ob&s;tinacy: High courts of ju&s;tice were
erected to try tho&s;e who had engaged in con&s;piracies and
in&s;urrections again&s;t the Protector's authority, and
whom he could not &s;afely commit to the verdict of ju|ries.
But the&s;e irregularities were deemed inevitable
con&s;equences of his illegal authority. And though of|ten
urged by his officers, as is pretended<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Clarendon, Life of Dr. Berwick, &amp;c.</NOTE>, to attempt
a general ma&s;&s;acre of the royali&s;ts, he always with hor|ror
rejected &s;uch &s;anguinary councils.</P>
<P>IN the army was laid the &s;ole ba&s;is of the Protector's
power; and in managing them con&s;i&s;ted the chief art
and delicacy of his government. The &s;oldiers were held
in the mo&s;t exact di&s;cipline; a policy, which both ac|cu&s;tomed
them to obedience, and made them le&s;s hate|ful
and burthen&s;ome to the people. He augmented their
pay; though the public nece&s;&s;ities &s;ometimes obliged
him to run in arrears to them. Their intere&s;ts, they
were &s;en&s;ible, were clo&s;ely united with tho&s;e of their
General and Protector. And he entirely commanded
their affectionate regard, by his ability and &s;ucce&s;s in
almo&s;t every enterprize, which he had hitherto under|taken.
But all military government is precarious; much
more where it &s;tands in oppo&s;ition to civil e&s;tabli&s;h|ments;
and &s;till more, where it encounters religious
prejudices. By the wild fanatici&s;m, which he had nou|ri&s;hed
<PB N="268" REF="352">
in the &s;oldiers, he had &s;educed them into mea|&s;ures,
for which, if openly propo&s;ed to them, they
would have entertained the utmo&s;t aver&s;ion. But this
&s;ame &s;pirit rendered them more difficult to be governed,
and made their caprices terrible even to that hand which
directed their movements. So often taught, that the
office of King was an u&s;urpation upon Chri&s;t, they were
apt to &s;u&s;pect a Protector not to be altogether compatible
with that divine authority. Harri&s;on, tho' rai&s;ed to the
highe&s;t dignity, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed entirely of Cromwel's con|fidence,
became his mo&s;t inveterate enemy as &s;oon as he
e&s;tabli&s;hed the authority of a &s;ingle per&s;on, again&s;t which
he had always made &s;uch violent prote&s;tations. Over|ton,
Rich, Okey, officers of great rank in the army,
were actuated with like principles, and Cromwel was
obliged to deprive them of their commi&s;&s;ions. Their
influence, which was before thought unbounded among
the troops, &s;eemed from that moment to be totally anni|hilated.</P>
<P>THE more effectually to curb the enthu&s;ia&s;tic and &s;e|ditious
&s;pirit of the troops, Cromwel e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind
of militia in the &s;everal counties. Companies of infan|try
and cavalry were inli&s;ted under proper officers, regu|lar
pay di&s;tributed among them, and a re&s;ource by that
means provided both again&s;t the in&s;urrections of the
royali&s;ts, and mutiny of the army.</P>
<P>RELIGION can never be deemed a point of &s;mall con|&s;equence
in civil government: But during this period,
it may be regarded as the great &s;pring of men's actions
and determinations. Tho' tran&s;ported, him&s;elf, with
the mo&s;t frantic whim&s;ies, Cromwel had adopted a
&s;cheme for regulating this principle in others which was
&s;agacious and politic. Being re&s;olved to maintain a na|tional
church, and yet determined neither to admit epi&s;|copacy
nor pre&s;bytery, he e&s;tabli&s;hed a number of com|mi&s;&s;ioners,
<PB N="269" REF="353">
under the name of <HI>Tryers,</HI> partly laymen,
partly eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;ome pre&s;byterians, &s;ome indepen|dants.
The&s;e pre&s;ented to all livings, which were for|merly
in the gift of the crown; they examined and ad|mitted
&s;uch per&s;ons as received holy orders; and they in|&s;pected
the lives, doctrine and behaviour of all the clergy.
In&s;tead of &s;upporting that union between learning and
theology, which has &s;o long been maintained in Europe,
the&s;e tryers embraced the latter principle in its full pu|rity,
and made it the &s;ole object of their examinations.
The candidates were no more perplexed with que&s;tions
concerning their progre&s;s in Greek and Roman erudi|tion;
concerning their talent for profane arts and
&s;ciences: The chief object of &s;crutiny regarded their
advances in grace, and fixing the critical moment of
their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>WITH the pretended &s;aints of all denominations
Cromwel was familiar and ea&s;y. Laying a&s;ide the &s;tate
of Protector, which, on other occa&s;ions, he well knew
how to maintain, he in&s;inuated to them, that nothing
but nece&s;&s;ity could ever induce him to inve&s;t him&s;elf
with it. He talked &s;piritually to them; he &s;ighed, he
weeped, he canted, he prayed. He even entered with
them into an emulation of gho&s;tly gifts; and the&s;e men,
in&s;tead of grieving to be outdone in their own way, were
proud, that his highne&s;s, by his princely example, had
dignified tho&s;e practices in which they them&s;elves were
daily occupied<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><P>Cromwel followed, tho' but in part, the advice which he received from general Harri&s;on, at the time when the intimacy and endearment mo&s;t &s;trongly &s;ub&s;i&s;ted betwixt them. &startq;Let the waiting upon Jehovah,&endq; &s;aid that military &s;aint, &startq;be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s you have every day $word$ Reck$n it &s;o, more than to eat, &s;leep, and council together.

<P><PB N="270" REF="354">
IF Cromwel could be &s;aid to adhere to any particular
form of religion, they were the independants who could
chiefly boa&s;t of his favour; and it may be affirmed, that
&s;uch pa&s;tors of that &s;ect, as were not pa&s;&s;ionately ad|dicted
to civil liberty, were all of them devoted to him.
The pre&s;byterians al&s;o, being &s;aved from the ravages of
the anabapti&s;ts and millenarians, and enjoying their
e&s;tabli&s;hments and tythes, were not aver&s;e to his go|vernment;
tho' he &s;till entertained a great jealou&s;y of
that ambitious and re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit, by which they were
actuated. He granted an unbounded liberty of con|&s;cience,
to all but catholics and prelati&s;ts; and by that
means, he both attached the wild &s;ectaries to his own
per&s;on, and employed them in curbing the domineering
&s;pirit of the pre&s;byterians. &startq;I am the only man,&endq; he
was often heard to &s;ay, &startq;who has known how to &s;ub|due
that in&s;olent &s;ect which can &s;uffer none but it|&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>THE prote&s;tant zeal, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the pre&s;byterians
$nd independants, was highly gratified by the haughty
manner, in which the Protector &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully &s;upported
the per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants throughout all Europe. Even
the duke of Savoy, &s;o remote a Prince, and &s;o little ex|po&s;ed
to the naval power of England, was obliged, by
the authority of France, to comply with his mediation,
and to tolerate the prote&s;tants of the vallies, again&s;t
whom that prince had commenced a furious per&s;ecution.
France it&s;elf was con&s;trained to bear, not only with the
religion, but even in &s;ome in&s;tances, with the &s;editious
in&s;olence of the Hugonots; and when that court ap|plied
for a reciprocal toleration of the catholic religion
in England, the Protector, who arrogated in every thing
<PB N="271" REF="355">
the &s;uperiority, would hearken to no &s;uch propo&s;al. He
had entered a project of in&s;tituting a college in imita|tion
of that at Rome, for the propagation of the faith;
and his apo&s;tles, in zeal, tho' not in unanimity, had
certainly been a full match for the catholics.</P>
<P>CROMWEL retained the church of England in con|&s;traint;
tho' he permitted its clergy a little more liberty
than the republican parliament had formerly allowed.
He was plea&s;ed, that the &s;uperior lenity of his admini|&s;tration
&s;hould in every thing be remarked. He bridled
the royali&s;ts, both by the mercenary army which he re|tained,
and by tho&s;e &s;ecret &s;pies, which he found means
to intermix in all their coun&s;els. Manning being di&s;|covered
and puni&s;hed with death, he corrupted Sir Ri|chard
Willis, who was much tru&s;ted by chancellor Hyde
and all the royali&s;ts; and by means of that man he was
let into every de&s;ign and con&s;piracy of the party. He
could di&s;concert any project, by confining the per&s;ons
who were the actors in it; and as he re&s;tored them af|terwards
to liberty, his &s;everity pa&s;&s;ed only for the re&s;ult
of general jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion. The &s;ecret &s;ource of
his intelligence remained &s;till unknown and un&s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>CONSPIRACIES for an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination he was chiefly
afraid of; the&s;e being de&s;igns, which no prudence nor
vigilance could evade. Colonel Titus, under the name
of Allen, had wrote a very &s;pirited di&s;cour&s;e, exhorting
every one to embrace this method of vengeance; and
Cromwel knew, that the inflamed minds of the royal
party were &s;ufficiently di&s;po&s;ed to put this doctrine in
practice again&s;t him. He openly told them, that a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations
were ba&s;e and odious, and he never would com|mence
ho&s;tilities by &s;o &s;hameful an expedient; but if
the fir&s;t attempt or provocation came from them, he
would retaliate to the uttermo&s;t. He had in&s;truments,

de&s;i&s;t, till he had totally exterminated the royal family.
This menace, more than all his guards, contributed to
the &s;ecurity of his per&s;on<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">About this time an accident had almo&s;t robbed the Protector of his li$$ and &s;aved his enemies the trouble of all their machinations.

<P>THERE was no point about which the Protector was
more &s;ollicitous than to procure intelligence. This arti|cle
alone, 'tis &s;aid, co&s;t him &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a
year. Po&s;tma&s;ters, both at home and abroad, were,
many of them, in his pay: Carriers were &s;earched or
bribed: Secretaries and clerks were corrupted: The

private information to him: And nothing could

attended him<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Bates.</NOTE>. Before the King's trial, a meeting was
agreed on between the chiefs of the republican party
and the general officers, in order to concert the model
of that free government, which they were to &s;ub&s;titute,
in place of the monarchical con&s;titution, now totally
&s;ubverted. After debates on this &s;ubject, the mo&s;t im|portant,
which could fall under the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of human
creatures, Ludlow tells us, that Cromwel, by way of
frolic, threw a cu&s;hion at his head; and when Ludlow
took up another cu&s;hion in order to return the compli|ment,
the General ran down &s;tairs, and had almo&s;t
broke his bones in the hurry. When the High Court
of Ju&s;tice was &s;igning the King's &s;entence, a matter, if
po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more &s;erious, Cromwel taking the pen in
his hand, before he &s;ub&s;cribed his name, bedaubed with
ink the face of Martin, who &s;at next him. And the
pen being delivered to Martin, he practi&s;ed the &s;ame
frolic upon Cromwel<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tryal of the Regicides.</NOTE>. He frequently gave fea&s;ts to
his inferior officers; and when the meat was &s;et upon
the table, a &s;ignal was given; the &s;oldiers ru&s;hed in
upon them; and with much noi&s;e, tumult, and confu|&s;ion,
ran away with all the di&s;hes, and di&s;appointed the
officers of their expected meal<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Bates.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AMIDST all the unguarded play and buffoonery of this
extraordinary per&s;onage, he took the opportunity of re|marking
<PB N="274" REF="360">
the characters, de&s;igns, and weakne&s;&s;es of men;
and he would &s;ometimes pu&s;h them, by an indulgence in
wine, to open to him the mo&s;t &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of their
bo&s;om. Great regularity, however, and even au&s;terity
of manners were always maintained in his court; and
he was careful never by any liberties to give offence to
the mo&s;t rigid of the godly. Some &s;tate was upheld;
but with little expence, and without any &s;plendor. The
nobility, tho' courted by him, kept at a di&s;tance, and
di&s;dained to intermix them&s;elves with tho&s;e mean per|&s;ons,
who were the in&s;truments of his government.
Without departing from oeconomy, he was generous to
tho&s;e who &s;erved him; and he knew how to find out
and engage in his intere&s;ts every man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e
talents, which any particular employment demanded.
His generals, his admirals, his judges, his amba&s;&s;adors,
were per&s;ons, who contributed, all of them, in their
&s;everal &s;pheres, to the &s;ecurity of the Protector and to
the honour and intere&s;t of the nation.</P>
<P>UNDER pretence of uniting Scotland and Ireland in
one Commonwealth with England, he had reduced the&s;e
kingdoms to a total &s;ubjection; and he treated them en|tirely
as conquered provinces. The civil admini&s;tration
of Scotland was placed in a council, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly
of Engli&s;h, of which lord Broghill was pre&s;ident. Ju&s;tice
was admini&s;tred by &s;even judges, four of whom were
Engli&s;h. In order to curb the tyrannical nobility, he
both aboli&s;hed all va&s;&s;alage<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Whitelocke, p. 570.</NOTE> and revived the office of
ju&s;tices of peace, which King James had introduced,
but was not able to &s;upport<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. iv. p. 57.</NOTE>. A long line of forts and
garri&s;ons were maintained throughout the kingdom. An
army of 10,000 men<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. vi. p. 557.</NOTE> kept every thing in peace and
obedience, and neither the banditti of the mountains
<PB N="275" REF="361">
nor the bigots of the low countries could indulge their
inclination to turbulence and di&s;order. He courted the
pre&s;byterian clergy; though he nouri&s;hed that inte&s;tine
enmity which prevailed between the re&s;olutioners and
prote&s;ters; and he found, that very little policy was
requi&s;ite to fo&s;ter quarrels among theologians. He per|mitted
no church a&s;&s;emblies, being &s;en&s;ible that from
thence had proceeded many of the pa&s;t mi&s;chiefs. And
in the main, the Scots were obliged to acknowledge,
that never before, while they enjoyed their irregular,
factious liberty, had they attained &s;o much happine&s;s as at
pre&s;ent, when reduced to &s;ubjection under a foreign na|tion.</P>
<P>THE Protector's admini&s;tration of Ireland was much
more &s;evere and violent. The government of that i&s;land
was fir&s;t entru&s;ted to Fleetwood, a notorious fanatic,
who had married Ireton's widow; then to Henry Crom|wel,
&s;econd &s;on to the Protector, a young man of an
amiable mild di&s;po&s;ition, and not de&s;titute of vigor and
capacity. Five millions of acres, forfeited either by the
popi&s;h rebellion or by the adherents of the King, were
divided, partly among the adventurers, who had advanced
money to the parliament, partly among the Engli&s;h &s;ol|diers,
who had arrears due to them. Examples of a more
&s;udden and violent change of property are &s;carce to be
found in any hi&s;tory. An order even pa&s;&s;ed to confine
all the native Iri&s;h to the province of Connaught, where
they would be &s;hut up by rivers, lakes, and mountains,
and could not, it was hoped, be any longer dangerous
to the Engli&s;h government: But this barbarous and ab|&s;urd
policy, which, from an impatience of attaining
immediate &s;ecurity, mu&s;t have depopulated all the other
provinces, and rendered the Engli&s;h e&s;tates of no value,
it was &s;oon found impo&s;&s;ible to reduce to practice.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="362">
CROMWEL began to hope, that by his admini&s;tra|tion,
attended with &s;o much lu&s;tre and &s;ucce&s;s abroad,
&s;o much order and tranquillity at home,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New Parlia|ment.</NOTE> he had now ac|quired
&s;uch authority as would enable him to meet the
repre&s;entatives of the nation, and would a&s;&s;ure him of
their dutiful compliance with his government. He there|fore
&s;ummoned a parliament; but not tru&s;ting altogether
to the good will of the people, he u&s;ed every art, which
his new model of repre&s;entation allowed him to employ,
in order to influence the elections and fill the hou&s;e with
his own creatures. Ireland, being entirely in the hands
of the army, cho&s;e none but &s;uch officers as were mo&s;t
acceptable to him. Scotland &s;howed the &s;ame compli|ance;
and as the nobility and gentry of that kingdom
regarded their attendance on Engli&s;h parliaments as an
ignominious badge of &s;lavery, it was, on that account,
more ea&s;y for the officers to prevail in the elections.
Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, the Protector &s;till
found, that the majority would not be favourable to
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Sep|tember.</NOTE> He &s;et guards, therefore, on the door, who per|mitted
none to enter but &s;uch as produced a warrant from
his council; and the council rejected about a hundred,
who either refu&s;ed a recognition of the Protector's go|vernment,
or were on other accounts obnoxious to him.
The&s;e prote&s;ted again&s;t &s;o egregious a violence, &s;ubver|&s;ive
of all liberty; but every application for redre&s;s was
neglected both by the council and the parliament.</P>
<P>THE majority of the parliament, by means of the&s;e
arts and violences, were now at la&s;t either friendly to
the Protector, or re&s;olved, by their compliance, to ad|ju&s;t,
if po&s;&s;ible, this military government to their laws
and liberties. They voted a renounciation of all title in
Charles Stuart or any of his family; and this was the
fir&s;t act, dignified with the appearance of national con|&s;ent,
which had ever had that tendency. Colonel Jeph|&s;on,
in order to found the inclinations of the hou&s;e,
<PB N="277" REF="363">
ventured to move, that the parliament &s;hould be&s;tow
the crown on Cromwel; and no &s;urprize nor reluctance
was di&s;covered on that occa&s;ion. When Cromwel af|terwards
a&s;ked Jeph&s;on what induced him to make &s;uch
a motion, &startq;As long,&endq; &s;aid Jeph&s;on, &startq;as I have the
honour to &s;it in parliament, I mu&s;t follow the dic|tates
of my own con&s;cience, whatever offence I may
be &s;o unfortunate as to give you.&endq; &startq;Get thee
gone,&endq; &s;aid Cromwel, giving him a gentle blow on
the &s;houlder, get thee gone for a mad fellow as thou
art.&endq;</P>
<P>IN order to pave the way to this advancement, for
which he &s;o ardently longed, Cromwel re&s;olved to &s;acri|fice
his major-generals, whom he knew to be extremely
odious to the nation. That mea&s;ure was al&s;o become
nece&s;&s;ary for his own &s;ecurity. All government, purely
military, fluctuates perpetually between a de&s;potic mo|narchy
and a de&s;potic ari&s;tocracy, according as the au|thority
of the chief commander prevails, or that of the
officers next him in rank and dignity. The major-generals,
being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much di&s;tinct juri&s;diction,
began to e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;eparate title to power, and had ren|dered
them&s;elves formidable to the Protector him&s;elf;
and for this inconvenience, tho' he had not fore&s;een it,
he well knew, before it was too late, to provide a pro|per
remedy. Claypole, his &s;on-in-law, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
entirely his confidence, abandoned them to the plea&s;ure
of the hou&s;e; and tho' the name was &s;till retained, it
was agreed to abridge, or rather entirely annihilate, the
power of the major-generals.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, a more formal motion was made by alderman
Pack, one of the city members, for inve&s;ting the Pro|tector
with the dignity of King. This motion, at fir&s;t,
excited great di&s;order, and divided the whole hou&s;e into
parties. The chief oppo&s;ition came from the u&s;ual ad|herents
<PB N="278" REF="364">
of the Protector, the major-generals and &s;uch
officers as depended on them. Lambert, a man of deep
intrigue and of great intere&s;t in the army, had long en|tertained
the ambition of &s;ucceeding Cromwel in the
Protector&s;hip; and he fore&s;aw, if the monarchy was re|&s;tored,
that hereditary right would al&s;o be e&s;tabli&s;hed,
and the crown be tran&s;mitted to the po&s;terity of the
prince fir&s;t elected. He pleaded, therefore, con&s;cience;
and exciting all tho&s;e civil and religious jealou&s;ies again&s;t
kingly government, which had been &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly en|couraged
among the &s;oldiers, and which &s;erved them as
a pretence for &s;o many violences, he formed a numerous
and &s;till more formidable party again&s;t the motion.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the motion was &s;upported by
every one, who was more particularly devoted to the
Protector, and who hoped, by &s;o acceptable a mea&s;ure,
to pay court to the prevailing authority. Many per&s;ons
al&s;o, attached to their country, de&s;paired of ever being
able to &s;ubvert the pre&s;ent illegal e&s;tabli&s;hment, and
were de&s;irous, by fixing it on antient foundations, to
induce the Protector, from views of his own &s;afety, to
pay a regard to the antient laws and liberties of the
kingdom. Even the royali&s;ts imprudently joined in the
&s;ame mea&s;ure; and hoped, that, when the que&s;tion re|garded
only per&s;ons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1657.</NOTE> not forms of government, no one
would any longer ballance between the antient royal
family,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Crown of|fered to Cromwel.</NOTE> and an ignoble u&s;urper, who, by blood, trea&s;on,
and perfidy, had made his way to the throne. The bill
was voted by a con&s;iderable majority; and a committee
was appointed to rea&s;on with the Protector, and to over|come
tho&s;e &s;cruples, which he pretended again&s;t accept|ing
&s;o liberal an offer.</P>
<P>THE conference la&s;ted for &s;everal days.<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of April.</NOTE> The committee
urged, that all the &s;tatutes and cu&s;toms of England were
founded on the &s;uppo&s;ition of regal authority, and could
not, without extreme violence, be adju&s;ted to any other
<PB N="279" REF="365">
form of government: That a Protector, except during
the minority of a king, was a name utterly unknown to
the laws; and no man was acquainted with the extent
or limits of his authority: That if it was attempted to
define every part of his juri&s;diction, many years, if not
ages, would be required for the execution of &s;o compli|cated
a work; if the whole power of the King was at
once transferred to him, the que&s;tion was plainly about
a name, and the preference was undi&s;putably due to
the antient title: That the Engli&s;h con&s;titution was
more anxious concerning the form of government than
concerning the birthright of the fir&s;t magi&s;trate, and had
provided, by an expre&s;s law of Henry VII. for the &s;e|curity
of tho&s;e who act in defence of the King in be|ing,
by whatever means he might have acquired po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion:
That it was extremely the intere&s;t of all his High|ne&s;s's
friends to &s;eek the &s;helter of this &s;tatute; and even
the people in general were de&s;irous of &s;uch a &s;ettlement,
and in all juries were with great difficulty induced to
give their verdict in favour of a Protector: That the
great &s;ource of all the late commotions, had been the
jealou&s;y of liberty; and that a republic, together with
a Protector, had been e&s;tabli&s;hed in order to provide far|ther
&s;ecurities for the freedom of the con&s;titution; but
that by experience the remedy had been found in&s;uffi|cient,
even dangerous and pernicious; &s;ince every unde|terminate
power, &s;uch as that of a Protector, mu&s;t be
arbitrary; and the more arbitrary, as it was contrary to
the genius and inclination of the people.</P>
<P>THE difficulty con&s;i&s;ted not in per&s;wading Cromwel.
He was &s;ufficiently convinced of the &s;olidity of the&s;e rea|&s;onings;
and his inclination, as well as judgement, was
intirely on the &s;ide of the committee. But how to bring
over the army to the &s;ame way of thinking was the que&s;tion.
The office of King had been painted to them in &s;uch
<PB N="280" REF="366">
horrible colours, that there were no hopes of reconcil|ing
them &s;uddenly to it, even though be&s;towed upon
their general, to whom they were &s;o much devoted. A
contradiction, open and direct, to all pa&s;t profe&s;&s;ions
would make them pa&s;s, in the eyes of the whole na|tion,
for the mo&s;t &s;hamele&s;s hypocrites, inli&s;ted by no
other than mercenary motives in the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t
perfidious traitor. Principles, &s;uch as they were, had
been encouraged in them by every con&s;ideration human
and divine; and though it was ea&s;y, where intere&s;t
concurred, to deceive them by the thinne&s;t di&s;gui&s;es, it
might be found dangerous at once to pull off the ma&s;que,
and &s;how them in a full light the whole crime and
deformity of their conduct. Su&s;pended between the&s;e
fears and his own mo&s;t ardent de&s;ires, Cromwel pro|tracted
the time, and &s;eemed &s;till to oppo&s;e the rea&s;on|ings
of the committee; in hopes, that by artifice he
might be able to reconcile the refractory minds of the
&s;oldiers to his new dignity.</P>
<P>WHILE the Protector argued &s;o much in contradiction
both to his judgement and inclination, it is no wonder,
that his elocution, always confu&s;ed, embarra&s;&s;ed, and
unintelligible, &s;hould be involved in tenfold darkne&s;s,
and di&s;cover no glimmering of common &s;en&s;e or rea&s;on.
An exact account of this conference remains, and may
be regarded as a great curio&s;ity. The members of the
committee, in their rea&s;onings, di&s;cover judgement,
knowlege, elocution: Lord Broghill in particular ex|erts
him&s;elf on this memorable occa&s;ion. But what a
contra&s;t, when we pa&s;s to the Protector's replies! After
&s;o &s;ingular a manner does nature di&s;tribute her talents,
that, in a nation abounding with &s;en&s;e and learning, a
man, who, by &s;uperior per&s;onal merit alone, had made
his way to &s;upreme dignity, and had even obliged the
parliament to make him an offer of the crown, was yet
<PB N="281" REF="367">
incapable of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf on this occa&s;ion, but in
a manner which a pea&s;ant of the mo&s;t ordinary capacity
would ju&s;tly be a&s;hamed of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">We &s;hall produce any pa&s;&s;age at random: For his di&s;cour&s;e is all of a piece. &startq;I confe&s;s, for it behoves me to deal plainly with you, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I would &s;ay, I hope, I may be under&s;tood in this, for indeed I mu&s;t be tender what I &s;ay to &s;uch an audience as this; I &s;ay, I would be under|&s;tood, that in this argument I do not make parallel betwixt men of a dif|ferent mind and a parliament, which &s;hall have their de&s;ires.

<P>THE oppo&s;ition, which Cromwel dreaded, was not
that which came from Lambert and his adherents,
whom he now regarded as his capital enemies, and
whom he was re&s;olved, on the fir&s;t occa&s;ion, to deprive
of all power and authority: It was that which he met

as well as inclination, were the mo&s;t devoted to
him. Fleetwood had married his daughter: De&s;borow
his &s;i&s;ter: Yet the&s;e per&s;ons, actuated by principle
alone, could, by no per&s;wa&s;ion, artifice, or entreaty,
be induced to con&s;ent that their friend and patron
&s;hould be inve&s;ted with regal dignity. They told him,
that, if he accepted of the crown, they would in&s;tantly
throw up their commi&s;&s;ions, and never afterwards
would have it in their power to &s;erve him<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 261.</NOTE> Colonel

Protector within a few hours after he &s;hould have ac|cepted
the offer of the parliament. Some &s;udden mutiny
in the army was ju&s;tly dreaded. And upon the whole,
Cromwel, after the agony and perplexity of long doubt,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He rejects it.</NOTE>
was at la&s;t obliged to refu&s;e that crown, which the re|pre&s;entatives
of the nation, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner,
had tendered to him. Mo&s;t hi&s;torians are inclined to
blame his choice: but he mu&s;t be allowed to be the be&s;t
judge of his own &s;ituation. And in &s;uch complicated
&s;ubjects, the alteration of a very minute circum&s;tance,
unknown to the &s;pectator, will often be &s;ufficient to
ca&s;t the ballance, and render a determination, which,
in it&s;elf, may be uneligible, very prudent, or even ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the actor. A dream or prophecy,
lord Clarendon mentions, which, he affirms, (and he
mu&s;t have known the truth) was univer&s;ally talked of
almo&s;t from the beginning of the civil wars, and long
before Cromwel was &s;o con&s;iderable a per&s;on as to be&s;tow
upon it any degree of probability. In this prophecy it
was foretold, that Cromwel &s;hould be the greate&s;t man
in England, and would nearly, but never would fully$
<PB N="283" REF="371">
mount the throne. Such a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion probably aro&s;e
from the heated imagination either of him&s;elf or of his
followers; and as it might be one cau&s;e of the great
progre&s;s, which he had already made, it is not an un|likely
rea&s;on, which may be a&s;&s;igned for his refu&s;ing at
this time any farther elevation. The parliament, when
the regal dignity was rejected by Cromwel, found
them&s;elves obliged to retain the name of a Common|wealth
and Protector; and as the government was hi|therto
a manife&s;t u&s;urpation, it was thought proper to
&s;anctify it by a &s;eeming choice of the people and their
repre&s;entatives. In&s;tead of the in&s;trument of govern|ment,
which was the work of the general officers alone,
an humble petition and advice was framed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Humble pe|tition and advice.</NOTE> and offered
to the Protector by the parliament. This was repre|&s;ented
as the great ba&s;is of the republican e&s;tabli&s;hment,
regulating and limiting the powers of each member of
the con&s;titution, and &s;ecuring the liberty of the people
to the mo&s;t remote po&s;terity. By this deed, the autho|rity
of Protector was in &s;ome particulars enlarged: In
others, it was con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed. He had the
power of nominating his &s;ucce&s;&s;or; he had a perpetual
revenue a&s;&s;igned him, a million a year for the fleet and
army, three hundred thou&s;and pounds for the civil go|vernment;
and he had authority to name another hou&s;e,
who &s;hould enjoy their &s;eats during life, and exerci&s;e
&s;ome functions of the former hou&s;e of peers. But he
abandoned the power a&s;&s;umed in the intervals of parlia|ment,
of framing laws with the con&s;ent of his council;
and he agreed, that no members of either hou&s;e &s;hould
be excluded but by the con&s;ent of that hou&s;e, of which
they were members. The other articles were in the
main the &s;ame as in the in&s;trument of government. The

no man could tru&s;t him&s;elf without &s;inking. Even the
humble petition and advice, which he extolled in its
turn, appeared &s;o lame and imperfect, that it was found
requi&s;ite, this very &s;e&s;&s;ion, to mend it by a &s;upplement;
and after all, it may be regarded as a very crude and
undige&s;ted model of government. It was, however, ac|cepted
for the deed of the whole people in the three united
nations; and Cromwel, as if his power had ju&s;t com|menced
from this popular con&s;ent, was anew inaugurated
in We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall, after the mo&s;t &s;olemn and mo&s;t
pompous manner.</P>
<P>THE parliament having adjourned it&s;elf,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of June.</NOTE> the Pro|tector
deprived. Lambert of all his commi&s;&s;ions; but &s;till
allowed him a con&s;iderable pen&s;ion, of 2000 pounds a
year, as a bribe for his future, peaceable deportment.
Lambert's authority in the army, to the great &s;urprize
of every body, was found immediately to expire with
the lo&s;s of his commi&s;&s;ion. Packer and &s;ome other offi|cers,
whom Cromwel &s;u&s;pected, were al&s;o di&s;placed.</P>
<P>RICHARD, elde&s;t &s;on to the Protector; was brought
to court, introduced into public bu&s;ine&s;s, and hence|forth
regarded by many as his heir in the Protector&s;hip;
though Cromwel &s;ometimes employed the gro&s;s artifice
of flattering others with the hopes of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
Richard was a per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t peaceable,
inoffen&s;ive, unambitious character; and had hitherto
lived contentedly in the country on a &s;mall e&s;tate, which
his wife had brought him. The little activity, which
he di&s;covered, was always exerted to beneficent pur|po&s;es:
At the time of the King's trial, he had fallen on
his knees before his father, and had conjured him, by
all the ties of duty and humanity, to &s;pare the life of that
monarch. Cromwel had two daughters unmarried: One
of them he now gave to the grand&s;on and heir of his great
friend, the Earl of Warwick, with whom he had, in
<PB N="285" REF="375">
every fortune, pre&s;erved an uninterrupted intimacy and
corre&s;pondence: The other, he married to the vi&s;count
Falconbridge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1658.</NOTE> of family, formerly devoted to the royal
party. He was very ambitious of forming connexions
with the nobility; and it was one chief motive of his
de&s;iring the title of King, that he might replace every
thing in its natural order, and re&s;tore to the antient fa|milies,
that tru&s;t and honour, of which he now found
him&s;elf obliged, for his own pre&s;ervation, to deprive
them.</P>
<P>THE parliament was again a&s;&s;embled; con&s;i&s;ting,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> as
in the times of monarchy, of two hou&s;es, the commons
and the other hou&s;e. Cromwel, during the interval,
had &s;ent writs to his hou&s;e of peers, which con&s;i&s;ted of
&s;ixty members. They were compo&s;ed of five or &s;ix an|tient
peers, of &s;everal gentlemen of fortune and di&s;tinc|tion,
and of &s;ome officers who had ri&s;en from the
meane&s;t profe&s;&s;ions. None of the antient peers, how|ever,
would deign to accept a feat, which they mu&s;t
&s;hare with &s;uch companions as were a&s;&s;igned them. The
Protector endeavoured at fir&s;t to maintain the appearance
of a legal magi&s;trate. He removed the guards from the
door of both hou&s;es: But &s;oon found how incom|patible
liberty is with military u&s;urpations. By bring|ing
&s;o great a number of his friends and adherents into
the other hou&s;e, he had lo&s;t the majority among the na|tional
repre&s;entatives. In con&s;equence of a clau&s;e in the
Humble Petition and Advice, the commons a&s;&s;umed a
power of re-admitting tho&s;e members, whom the coun|cil
had formerly excluded. Sir Arthur Hazelrig and
&s;ome others, whom Cromwel had created lords, rather
cho&s;e to take their &s;eats with the commons. An un|conte&s;table
majority now declared them&s;elves again&s;t the
Protector; and they refu&s;ed to acknowledge the juri&s;dic|tion
of that other hou&s;e, which he had e&s;tabli&s;hed. Even
<PB N="286" REF="376">
the validity of the Humble Petition and Advice was que&s;|tioned;
as being voted by a parliament, which lay un|der
force, and which was deprived by military violence
of a con&s;iderable number of its members. The Protec|tor,
dreading combinations between the parliament and
the malecontents in the army, was re&s;olved to allow no
lei&s;ure for the forming any con&s;piracy again&s;t him; and
with great expre&s;&s;ions of anger and di&s;plea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Febru|ary.</NOTE> he di&s;|&s;olved
the parliament. When urged by Fleetwood and
others of his friends not to precipitate him&s;elf into this
ra&s;h mea&s;ure, he &s;wore by the living God, that they
&s;hould not &s;it a moment longer. The&s;e di&s;tractions at
home were not able to take off the Protector's attention
from foreign affairs; and in all his mea&s;ures he pro|ceeded
with equal vigour and enterprize, as if &s;ecure of
the duty and attachment of all the three kingdoms. His
alliance with Sweden he &s;till &s;upported; and he endea|voured
to a&s;&s;i&s;t that crown in its &s;ucce&s;sful enterprizes,
for reducing all its neighbours to &s;ubjection, and ren|dering
it&s;elf ab&s;olutely ma&s;ter of the Baltic. As &s;oon
as Spain declared war again&s;t him, he concluded a peace
and an alliance with France, and united him&s;elf in all
his councils with that potent and ambitious kingdom.
Spain, having long courted in vain the friend&s;hip of
the &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;urper, was reduced at la&s;t to apply to
the unfortunate Prince. Charles formed a league with
Philip, removed his &s;mall court to Bruges in the Low
Countries, and rai&s;ed four regiments of his own &s;ub|jects,
whom he employed in the Spani&s;h &s;ervice. The
Duke of York, who had, with great applau&s;e, &s;erved
&s;ome campaigns in the French army, and who had me|rited
the particular e&s;teem of Mar&s;hal Turenne, now
joined his brother, and continued to &s;eek military expe|rience
under Don John of Au&s;tria and the Prince of
Cond&eacute;. The &s;cheme of foreign politics, adopted by
the Protector, was highly imprudent, but was &s;uitab$$

was &s;o &s;ignally endowed. He was particularly de&s;irous

taken, and put into their hands. Early this campaign,
&s;iege was laid to Dunkirk; and when the Spani&s;h army
advanced to relieve it, the combined armies of France
and England marched out of their trenches, and fought
the battle of the Dunes, where the Spaniards were
totally defeated<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">It was remarked by the pretended &s;aints of that time, that the battle was fought on a day which was held for a fa&s;t in London, &s;o that as Fleetwood &s;aid (Thurloe, vol. vii. p. 159) while we were praying, they were fight|ing; and the Lord hath given a &s;ignal an&s;wer. The Lord has not only owned us in our work there, but in our waiting upon him in a way of prayer, which is indeed our old experienced approved way in all &s;treights and difficulties.

You have, &s;ays he, as I verily believe and am per&s;waded, a plentiful &s;tock of prayers going for you daily, &s;ent up by the &s;obere&s;t and mo&s;t approved mini&s;ters and chri&s;|tians in this nation, and, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome di&s;couragements, very much wre&s;tling of faith for you, which are to us, and I tru&s;t will be to you, mat|ter of great encouragement. But notwith&s;tanding all this, it will be good for you and us to deliver up our&s;elves and all our affairs to the di&s;po&s;ition of our all-wi&s;e Father, who not only out of prerogative, but becau&s;e of his good|ne&s;s, wi&s;dom and truth, ought to be re&s;igned unto by his creatures, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are children of his begetting through the &s;pirit, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

remarked on this occa&s;ion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dunkirk taken.</NOTE> Dunkirk, being &s;oon after

He committed the government of that important place
to Lockart, a Scot&s;man of ability, who had married his
niece, and was his amba&s;&s;ador in the court of France.</P>
<P>THIS acqui&s;ition was regarded by the Protector as the
means only of obtaining farther advantages. He was re|&s;olved

in England, &s;o chimerical or rather &s;o dangerous a
project, would certainly have been reduced to execu|tion.
And this fir&s;t and principal &s;tep towards Univer|&s;al
Monarchy, which France, during a whole century,
has never yet been able, by an infinite expence of
blood and trea&s;ure, fully to effectuate, had at once
been accompli&s;hed by the enterprizing, though un&s;kil|ful
politics of Cromwel.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e tran&s;actions, great demon&s;trations of
mutual friend&s;hip and regard pa&s;&s;ed between the French
King and the Protector. Lord Falconbrige, Cromwel's
&s;on-in-law, was &s;ent over to Louis, then in the camp
before Dunkirk; and was received with the &s;ame re|gard,

<P>THE Protector reaped little &s;atisfaction from the &s;uc|ce&s;s
of his arms abroad: The &s;ituation in which he
&s;tood at home kept him in perpetual unea&s;ine&s;s and in|quietude.
His admini&s;tration, &s;o expen&s;ive both by mi|litary
enterprizes and &s;ecret intelligence, had exhau&s;ted
his revenue, and involved him in a con&s;iderable debt.
The royali&s;ts, he heard, had renewed their con&s;piracies,
for a general in&s;urrection; and Ormond was &s;ecretly
<PB N="289" REF="381">
come over with a view of concerting mea&s;ures for the
execution of this project. Lord Fairfax, Sir William
Waller, and many heads of the pre&s;byterians, had &s;e|cretly
entered into the engagement. Even the army
was infected with the general &s;pirit of di&s;content, and
&s;ome &s;udden and dangerous eruption was every moment
to be dreaded from them. No hopes remained, after
his violent breach with the la&s;t parliament, that he
would ever be able to e&s;tabli&s;h, with general con&s;ent, a
legal &s;ettlement, or temper the military with the mix|ture
of any civil authority. All his arts and policy were
exhau&s;ted; and having &s;o often, by fraud and fal&s;e pre|tences,
deceived every party, and almo&s;t every indivi|dual,
he could no longer hope, by repeating the &s;ame
profe&s;&s;ions, to meet with equal confidence and regard.</P>
<P>HOWEVER zealous the royali&s;ts, their con&s;piracy took
not effect: Willis di&s;covered the whole to the Protector.
Ormond was obliged to fly, and he deemed him&s;elf for|tunate
to have e&s;caped &s;o vigilant an admini&s;tration.
Great numbers were thrown into pri&s;on. An high
court of ju&s;tice was anew erected for the trial of &s;uch
of the criminals, who&s;e guilt was mo&s;t apparent. Not|with&s;tanding
the recognition of his authority by the la&s;t
parliament, the Protector could not, as yet, tru&s;t to an
unbya&s;&s;ed jury. Sir Henry Sling&s;by, Dr. Huet, were
condemned and beheaded. Mordaunt, brother to the
Earl of Peterborow, very narrowly e&s;caped. The num|bers
for his condemnation and his acquital were equal;
and ju&s;t as the &s;entence was pronounced in his favour,
Colonel Pride, who was re&s;olved to condemn him,
came into the court. A&s;hton, Storey, and Be&s;tley
were hanged in different &s;treets of the city.</P>
<P>THE con&s;piracy of the Millenarians in the army
&s;truck Cromwel with &s;till greater apprehen&s;ions. Har|ri&s;on
and the other di&s;carded officers of that party could
not remain at re&s;t. Stimulated equally by revenge, by
<PB N="290" REF="382">
ambition, and by con&s;cience, they &s;till harboured in
their mind &s;ome de&s;perate project; and there wanted
not officers in the army, who, from like motives, were
di&s;po&s;ed to &s;econd all their undertakings. The levellers
and agitators had been encouraged by Cromwel to inter|po&s;e
with their advice in all political deliberations; and
he had even pretended to honour many of them with
his mo&s;t intimate friend&s;hip, while he conducted his
daring enterprizes again&s;t the King and the parliament.
It was an u&s;ual practice with him, in order to familia|rize
him&s;elf the more with the agitators, who were com|monly
corporals or &s;erjeants, to take them to bed with
him, and there, after prayers and exhortations, to di&s;|cu&s;s
together their projects and principles, political as
well as religious. Having a&s;&s;umed the dignity of Pro|tector,
he excluded them from all his councils, and
had neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to indulge them any
farther in their wonted familiarities. Among tho&s;e who
were enraged at this alteration was Sexby; an active
agitator, who now employed again&s;t him all that re&s;tle&s;s
indu&s;try which had formerly been exerted in his favour.
He even went &s;o far as to enter into a negotiation with
Spain; and Cromwel, who knew the di&s;tempers of the
army, was ju&s;tly afraid of &s;ome mutiny, to which a
day, an hour, an in&s;tant, might provide leaders.</P>
<P>OF a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations likewi&s;e he was apprehen&s;ive, from
the zealous &s;pirit, which actuated the &s;oldiers. Sinder|come
had undertaken to murder him; and by the mo&s;t
unaccountable accidents had hitherto been prevented
from executing his bloody purpo&s;e. His de&s;ign was di&s;|covered;
but the Protector could never find the bottom
of the enterprize, nor detect any of his accomplices.
He was tried by a jury; and notwith&s;tanding the gene|ral
odium attending that crime, notwith&s;tanding the
clear and full proof of his guilt, &s;o little conviction
prevailed of the Protector's right to the &s;upreme govern|ment,
<PB N="291" REF="383">
it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 53.</NOTE> that this con|&s;pirator
was condemned. When every thing was pre|pared
for his execution, he was found dead; from poi|&s;on,
as is &s;uppo&s;ed, which he had voluntarily taken.</P>
<P>THE Protector might better have &s;upported tho&s;e
fears and apprehen&s;ions, which the public di&s;tempers
occa&s;ioned, had he enjoyed any dome&s;tic &s;atisfaction, or
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any cordial friend of his own family, in who&s;e
bo&s;om he could &s;afely have unloaded his anxious and
corroding cares. But Fleetwood, his &s;on-in-law, actu|ated
with the wilde&s;t zeal, began to e&s;trange him&s;elf
from him; and was enraged to di&s;cover, that Cromwel,
in all his enterprizes, had entertained views of promot|ing
his own grandeur, more than of encouraging piety
and religion, of which he made &s;uch fervent profe&s;&s;ions.
His elde&s;t daughter, married to Fleetwood, had adopted
republican principles &s;o vehement, that &s;he could not with
patience behold power lodged in a &s;ingle per&s;on, even in
her indulgent father. His other daughters were no le&s;s
prejudiced in favour of the royal cau&s;e, and regreted
the violences and iniquities, into which, they thought,
their family had &s;o unhappily been tran&s;ported. But
above all, the &s;ickne&s;s of Mrs. Claypole, his peculiar
favorite, a lady endued with every humane virtue and
amiable accompli&s;hment, depre&s;&s;ed his anxious mind,
and poi&s;oned all his enjoyments. She had entertained
an high regard for Dr. Huet, lately executed; and be|ing
refu&s;ed his pardon, the melancholy of her temper,
encrea&s;ed by her di&s;tempered body, had prompted her to
lament to her father all his &s;anguinary mea&s;ures, and
urge him to compunction for tho&s;e heinous crimes, into
which his fatal ambition had betrayed him. Her death,
which followed &s;oon after, gave new edge to every
word, which &s;he had uttered.</P>
<P><PB N="292" REF="384">
ALL compo&s;ure of mind was now for ever fled from
the Protector: He found, that the grandeur, which he
had attained with &s;o much guilt and courage, could
not en&s;ure him that tranquillity, which it belongs to
virtue alone, and moderation fully to a&s;certain. Over|whelmed
with the load of public affairs, dreading per|petually
&s;ome fatal accident in his di&s;tempered govern|ment,
&s;eeing nothing around him but treacherous friends
or enraged enemies, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the confidence of no
party, re&s;ting his title on no principle, civil or religious,
his power he found to depend on &s;o delicate a poize of
factions and intere&s;ts, as the &s;malle&s;t event was able,
without any preparation, in a moment to overturn.
Death too, which, with &s;uch &s;ignal intrepidity, he had
braved in the field, being ince&s;&s;antly threatened by the
poniards of fanatical or intere&s;ted a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, was ever pre|&s;ent
to his terrified apprehen&s;ions, and haunted him in
every &s;cene of bu&s;ine&s;s or repo&s;e. Each action of his
life betrayed the terrors under which he laboured. The
a&s;pect of &s;trangers was unea&s;y to him: With a piercing
and anxious eye he &s;urveyed every face, to which he
was not daily accu&s;tomed. He never moved a &s;tep with|out
&s;trong guards attending him: He wore armour un|der
his cloaths, and farther &s;ecured him&s;elf by offen&s;ive
weapons, a &s;word, falchion, and pi&s;tols, which he al|ways
carried about him. He returned from no place
by the direct road, or by the &s;ame way which he went.
Every journey he performed with hurry and precipita|tion.
Seldom he &s;lept above three nights together in the
&s;ame chamber: And he never let it be known before|hand
what chamber he intended to choo&s;e, nor entru&s;ted
him&s;elf in any, which was not provided with backdoors,
at which &s;entinels were carefully placed. Society terri|fied
him, while he reflected on his numerous, unknown,
and implacable enemies: Solitude a&s;toni&s;hed him, by
withdrawing that protection, which he found &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary
for his &s;ecurity.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="385">
HIS body al&s;o, from the contagion of his anxious
mind, began to be affected; and his health &s;eemed very
&s;en&s;ible to decline. He was &s;eized with a &s;low fever,
which changed into a tertian ague.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sickne&s;s of the Protec|tor.</NOTE> For the &s;pace of a
week, no dangerous &s;ymptoms appeared; and in the
intervals of the fits he was able to walk abroad. At
length, the fever encrea&s;ed, and he him&s;elf began to
entertain &s;ome thoughts of death, and to ca&s;t his eye
towards that future exi&s;tence, who&s;e idea had once
been intimately pre&s;ent to him; though &s;ince, in the
hurry of affairs, and the &s;hock of wars and factions, it
had, no doubt, been con&s;iderably obliterated. He a&s;k|ed
Goodwin, one of his preachers, if the doctrine was
true, that the elect could never fall or &s;uffer a final re|probation.
&startq;Nothing more certain,&endq; replied the
preacher. &startq;Then am I &s;afe,&endq; &s;aid the Protector: &startq;For
I am &s;ure that once I was in a &s;tate of grace.&endq;</P>
<P>HIS phy&s;icians were &s;en&s;ible of the perilous condition,
to which his di&s;temper had reduced him: But his chap|lains,
by their prayers, vi&s;ions, and revelations, &s;o
buoyed up his hopes, that he began to believe his life
out of all danger. A favourable an&s;wer, it was pre|tended,
had been returned by heaven to the petitions of
all the godly; and he relied on their a&s;&s;everations much
more than on the opinion of the mo&s;t experienced phy|&s;icians.
&startq;I tell you,&endq; he cried with confidence to the
latter, &startq;I &s;hall not die of this di&s;temper: I am well
a&s;&s;ured of my recovery. It is promi&s;ed by the Lord,
not only to my &s;upplications, but al&s;o to that of men
who hold a &s;tricter commerce and more intimate cor|re&s;pondence
with him. Ye may have &s;kill in your
profe&s;&s;ion; but nature can do more than all the phy|&s;icians
in the world, and God is far above nature<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Bates: See al&s;o Thurloe, vol. vii. p. 355. 416.</NOTE>.&endq;
Nay, to &s;uch a degree of madne&s;s did their enthu&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="294" REF="386">
a&s;&s;urances mount, that upon a fa&s;t day, which was ob|&s;erved,
on his account, both at Hampton Court and at
Whitehall, they did not &s;o much pray for his health, as
give thanks for the undoubted pledges, which they had
received of his recovery. He him&s;elf was overheard of|fering
up his addre&s;&s;es to heaven; and &s;o far had the il|lu&s;ions
of fanatici&s;m prevailed over the plaine&s;t dictates
of natural morality, that he a&s;&s;umed more the character
of a mediator, in interceding for his people, than that of
a criminal, who&s;e atrocious violation of &s;ocial duty had,
from every tribunal, human and divine, merited the &s;e|vere&s;t
vengeance.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE all the &s;ymptoms began to wear a more
fatal a&s;pect; and the phy&s;icians were obliged to break
&s;ilence, and to declare that the Protector could not &s;ur|vive
the next fit, with which he was threatened. The
council was alarmed. A deputation was &s;ent to know
his will with regard to his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. His &s;en&s;es were
gone, and he could not now expre&s;s his intentions. They

Richard, &s;hould &s;ucceed him in the Protector&s;hip. A
&s;imple affirmative was, or &s;eemed to be extorted from
him. Soon after, on the 3d of September, that very
day, which he had always con&s;idered as the mo&s;t fortu|nate
to him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His death,</NOTE> he expired. A violent tempe&s;t, which
immediately &s;ucceeded his death, &s;erved as a &s;ubject of

it as confirmation of their particular prejudices.</P>
<P>THE writers, attached to the memory of this won|derful

&s;hort line of his mortal life could have &s;tretched out
to the extent of his immortal de&s;igns?&endq;</P>
<P>MY intention is not to disfigure this picture, drawn
by &s;o ma&s;terly a hand: I &s;hall only endeavour to re|move
from it &s;omewhat of the marvellous; a circum|&s;tance
which, on all occa&s;ions, gives much ground for
doubt and &s;u&s;picion. It &s;eems to me, that the circum|&s;tance
of Cromwel's life, in which his abilities are prin|cipally
di&s;covered, is his ri&s;ing from a private &s;tation, in
oppo&s;ition to &s;o many rivals, &s;o much advanced before
him, to a high command and authority in the army.
His great courage, his &s;ignal military talents, his emi|nent
dexterity and addre&s;s, were all requi&s;ite for this im|portant
acqui&s;ition. Yet will not this promotion appear
the effect of &s;upernatural abilities, when we con&s;ider,
that Fairfax him&s;elf, a private gentleman, who had not
the advantage of a &s;eat in parliament, had, thro' the &s;ame
&s;teps, attained even a &s;uperior rank, and, if indued with
<PB N="297" REF="391">
common capacity and penetration, had been able to re|tain
it. To incite &s;uch an army to rebellion again&s;t the
parliament, required no uncommon art or indu&s;try: To
have kept them in obedience had been the more difficult
enterprize. When the breach was once formed be|tween
the military and civil powers, a &s;upreme and ab|&s;olute
authority, from that moment is devolved on the
general; and if he is afterwards plea&s;ed to employ arti|$ice
or policy, it may be regarded, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions,
as great conde&s;cen&s;ion, if not as a &s;uperfluous caution.
That Cromwel was ever able really to blind or over-reach,
either the King or the republicans, does not ap|pear:
As they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of re&s;i&s;ting the force
under his command, they were glad to temporize with
him, and, by &s;eeming to be deceived, wait for oppor|tunities
of freeing them&s;elves from his dominion. If
he &s;educed the military fanatics, it is to be con&s;idered,
that their intere&s;t and his evidently concurred, that their
ignorance and low education expo&s;ed them to the gro&s;&s;e&s;t
impo&s;ition, and that he him&s;elf was at bottom as frantic
an enthu&s;ia&s;t as the wor&s;t of them, and, in order to ob|tain
their confidence, needed but to di&s;play tho&s;e vulgar
and ridiculous habits, which he had early acquired, and
on which he &s;et &s;o high a value. An army is &s;o for|cible,
and at the &s;ame time &s;o coar&s;e a weapon, that
any hand which wields it, may, without much dexte|rity,
perform any operation, and attain any a&s;cendant
in human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE dome&s;tic admini&s;tration of Cromwel, though it
di&s;covers great ability, was conducted without any plan
either of liberty or arbitrary power: Perhaps, his diffi|cult
&s;ituation admitted of neither. His foreign enter|prizes,
though full of intrepidity, were pernicious to
national intere&s;t, and &s;eem more the re&s;ult of impetuous
fury or narrow prejudices, than of cool fore&s;ight and
deliberation. An eminent per&s;onage however, he was
<PB N="298" REF="392">
in many re&s;pects, and even a &s;uperior genius; but un|equal
and irregular in his operations. And though not
defective in any talent, except that of elocution, the
abilities, which in him were mo&s;t admirable, and which
mo&s;t contributed to his marvellous &s;ucce&s;s, were the
magnanimous re&s;olution of his enterprizes, and his pe|culiar
dexterity in di&s;covering the characters, and prac|ti&s;ing
on the weakne&s;&s;es of mankind.</P>
<P>IF we &s;urvey the moral character of Cromwel with
that indulgence, which is due to the blindne&s;s and in|firmities
of the human &s;pecies, we &s;hall not be inclined
to load his memory with &s;uch violent reproaches as tho&s;e
which his enemies u&s;ually throw upon it. Amid&s;t the
pa&s;&s;ion and prejudices of that time, that he &s;hould pre|fer
the parliamentary to the royal cau&s;e, will not appear
very extraordinary; &s;ince, even at pre&s;ent, many men
of &s;en&s;e and knowledge are di&s;po&s;ed to think, that the
que&s;tion with regard to the ju&s;tice of the quarrel may
be regarded as very doubtful and ambiguous. The mur|der
of the King, the mo&s;t atrocious of all his actions,
was to him covered under a mighty cloud of republican
and fanatical illu&s;ions; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that he
might believe it, as many others did, the mo&s;t merito|rious
action, which he could perform. His &s;ub&s;equent
u&s;urpation was the effect of nece&s;&s;ity, as well as of am|bition;
nor is it ea&s;y to &s;ee, how the various factions
could at that time have been re&s;trained, without a mix|ture
of military and arbitrary authority. The private
deportment of Cromwel, as a &s;on, a hu&s;band, a father,
a friend, is expo&s;ed to no con&s;iderable cen&s;ure, if it does
not rather merit prai&s;e. And upon the whole, his cha|racter
does not appear more extraordinary and unu&s;ual
by the mixture of &s;o much ab&s;urdity with &s;o much pe|netration,
than by his tempering &s;uch violent ambition
and &s;uch enraged fanatici&s;m with &s;o much regard to ju&s;|tice
and humanity.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="393">
CROMWEL was in the fifty-ninth year of his age
when he died. He was of a romantic frame of body,
and of a manly, though not an agreeable a&s;pect. He
le&s;t only two &s;ons, Richard and Henry; and three
daughters; one married to General Fleetwood, another
to Lord Falconbridge, a third to Lord Rich. His fa|ther
died when he was young. His mother lived till
after he was Protector; and, contrary to her orders, he
buried her with great pomp in We&s;tmin&s;ter Abbey. She
could not be per&s;uaded, that his power or per&s;on was
ever in &s;ecurity. At every noi&s;e, which &s;he heard, &s;he
exclaimed, that her &s;on was murdered; and was never
&s;atisfied that he was alive, if &s;he did not receive frequent
vi&s;its from him. She was a decent woman; and by her
frugality and indu&s;try had rai&s;ed and educated a nume|rous
family upon a &s;mall fortune. She had even been
obliged to &s;et up a brewery at Huntington, which &s;he
managed to good advantage. Hence Cromwel, in the
invectives of that age, is often &s;tigmatized with the
name of the Brewer. Ludlow, by way of in&s;ult, men|tions
the great acce&s;&s;ion, which he would receive to his
royal revenues upon his mother's death, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a
jointure of &s;ixty pounds a year upon his e&s;tate. She
was of a good family, of the name of Stuart; remotely
allied, as is by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed, to the royal family.</P>

<P>ALL the arts of Cromwel's policy had been &s;o
often practi&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXII.</NOTE> that they began to lo&s;e their ef|fect;
and his authority, in&s;tead of being confirmed by
time and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;eemed every day to become more un|certain
and precarious. His friends the mo&s;t clo&s;ely
connected with him, and his coun&s;ellors the mo&s;t tru&s;ted,
were entering into cabals again&s;t his authority; and with
all his penetration into the characters of men, he could
not find any mini&s;ters, on whom he could rely. Men
of &s;trict probity and honour, he knew, would not &s;ub|mit
to be in&s;truments of an u&s;urpation, violent and il|legal:
Tho&s;e, who were free from the re&s;traint of prin|ciple,
might betray, for intere&s;t, that cau&s;e, in which,
from no better motives, they had inli&s;ted them&s;elves.
Even tho&s;e, on whom he conferred any favour, never
e&s;teemed the recompence &s;ufficient for the &s;acrifices,
which they made to obtain it: Whoever was refu&s;ed
<PB N="301" REF="395">
any demand, ju&s;tified his anger by the &s;pecious colours
of con&s;cience and of duty. Such difficulties &s;urrounded
the Protector, that his dying at &s;o critical a time, is
deemed by many the mo&s;t fortunate circum&s;tance that
ever attended him; and it was thought that all his cou|rage
and dexterity could not much longer have extended
his u&s;urped admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>BUT when that potent hand was removed, which
conducted the government, every one expected a &s;udden
di&s;&s;olution of the unweildy and ill-jointed fabric. Ri|chard,
a young man of no experience, educated in the
country, accu&s;tomed to a retired life, unacquainted
with the officers and unknown to them, recommended
by no military exploits, endeared by no familiarities,
could not long, it was thought, maintain that authority,
which his father had acquired by &s;o many valorous at|chievements,
and &s;uch &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;&s;es. And when it
was ob&s;erved, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the virtues of pri|vate
life, which in his &s;ituation were &s;o many vices;
that indolence, incapacity, irre&s;olution attended his fa|cility
and good nature; the various hopes of men were
excited by the expectation of &s;ome great event or revo|lution.
For &s;ome time, however, the public was di&s;|appointed
in this opinion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Richard ac|knowleged Protector.</NOTE> The council recognized the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Richard: Fleetwood, in who&s;e favour, it
was &s;uppo&s;ed, Cromwel had formerly made a will, re|nounced
all claim or preten&s;ion to the Protector&s;hip:
Henry, Richard's brother, who governed Ireland with
great popularity, en&s;ured him the obedience of that
kingdom: Monk, who&s;e authority was well e&s;tabli&s;hed
in Scotland, being much attached to his family, im|mediately
proclaimed the new Protector: The army,
every where, the fleet, acknowleged his title: Above
ninety addre&s;&s;es, from the counties and mo&s;t con&s;ider|able
corporations, congratulated him on his acce&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="302" REF="396">
in all the terms of dutiful allegiance: Foreign mini&s;ters
were forward in paying him the u&s;ual compliments:
And Richard, who&s;e moderate, unambitious character,
never would have led him to contend for empire, was
tempted to accept of &s;o rich a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which &s;eemed
to be tendered to him, by the con&s;ent of all man|kind.</P>
<P>IT was found nece&s;&s;ary to call a parliament, in order
to furni&s;h &s;upplies, both for the ordinary admini&s;tra|tion,
and for fulfilling tho&s;e engagements with foreign
Princes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A parlia|ment.</NOTE> particularly Sweden, into which the la&s;t Pro|tector
had entered. In hopes of obtaining greater in|fluence
on elections, the antient right was re&s;tored to
all the &s;mall burroughs; and the counties were allowed
no more than their accu&s;tomed members.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1659.</NOTE> The Hou&s;e
of Peers or the other Hou&s;e con&s;i&s;ted of the &s;ame per|&s;ons,
who had been nominated by Oliver.</P>
<P>ALL the commons,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Janu|ary.</NOTE> at fir&s;t, &s;igned without he&s;itation
an engagement not to alter the pre&s;ent government.
They next proceeded to examine the humble petition
and advice; and after great oppo&s;ition and many vehe|ment
di&s;putes, it was, at la&s;t, with much difficulty, car|ried
by the court-party to confirm it. An acknowlege|ment
too of the authority of the other hou&s;e was ex|torted
from them; tho' it was re&s;olved not to treat this
hou&s;e of peers with any greater re&s;pect than they &s;hould
return to the commons. A declaration was al&s;o made,
that the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the other hou&s;e &s;hould no way
prejudice the right of &s;uch of the antient peers as had,
from the beginning of the war, adhered to the parlia|ment.
In all parliamentary tran&s;actions, the oppo&s;ition
among the commons was &s;o con&s;iderable, and the de|bates
were &s;o prolonged, as much retarded all bu&s;ine&s;$,
and gave great alarm to the partizans of the young
Protector.</P>
<P><PB N="303" REF="397">
BUT there was another quarter from which greater
dangers were ju&s;tly apprehended. The mo&s;t con&s;ider|able
officers of the army, and even Fleetwood, brother|in-law
to the Protector, were entering into cabals again&s;t
him. No character in human &s;ociety is more dangerous
than that of the fanatic; becau&s;e, if attended with weak
judgment, he is expo&s;ed to the &s;ugge&s;tions of others;
if &s;upported by more di&s;cernment, he is entirely go|verned
by his own illu&s;ions, which &s;anctify his mo&s;t
&s;elfi&s;h views and pa&s;&s;ions. Fleetwood was of the for|mer
&s;pecies; and being extremely addicted to a republic
and even to the fifth monarchy or dominion of the &s;aints,
it was ea&s;y for tho&s;e, who had in&s;inuated them&s;elves
into his confidence, to in&s;til di&s;gu&s;ts again&s;t the dig|nity
of Protector. The whole republican party in the
army, which were &s;till con&s;iderable, Fitz, Ma&s;on, Mo&s;s,
Farley, united them&s;elves to that general. The officers
too of the &s;ame party, whom Cromwel had di&s;$arded,
Overton, Ludlow, Rich, Okey, Alured, began to ap|pear,
and to recover that authority, which had been
only for a time &s;u&s;pended. A party likewi&s;e, who &s;ound
them&s;elves eclip&s;ed in Richard's favour, Sydenham, Kel|&s;ey,
Berry, Haines, joined the cabal of the others.
Even De&s;borow, the Protector's uncle, lent his autho|rity
to that faction. But above all, the intrigues of
Lambert, who was now rouzed from his retreat, in|flamed
all the&s;e dangerous humours, and threatened the
nation with &s;ome great convul&s;ion. All the di&s;contented
officers e&s;tabli&s;hed their meetings at Fleetwood's lodg|ings;
and becau&s;e he dwelt in Wallingford-hou&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cabal of Wallingford Hou&s;e.</NOTE> the
party received a denomination from that place.</P>
<P>RICHARD, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither re&s;olution nor pene|tration,
was prevailed with to give an unguarded con|&s;ent
for calling a council of general officers, who might
make him propo&s;als, as they pretended, for the good of the
<PB N="304" REF="398">
army. No &s;ooner were they a&s;&s;embled than they voted
a remon&s;trance. They there lamented, that <HI>the good old
cau&s;e,</HI> as they termed it, that is, the cau&s;e, for which
they had engaged again&s;t the King, was entirely neg|lected;
and they propo&s;ed as a remedy, that the whole
military power, the command of the armies, &s;hould be
entru&s;ted to &s;ome per&s;on, in whom they might all con|fide.
The city militia, influenced by two aldermen;
Tichburn and Ireton, expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame re&s;olution of
adhering to <HI>the good old cau&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THE Protector was very ju&s;tly alarmed at tho&s;e move|ments
among the officers. The per&s;ons, in whom he
chiefly confided, were all of them, excepting Broghill,
men of civil characters and profe&s;&s;ions; Fiennes, Thur|loe,
Whitlocke, Wol&s;eley; who could only a&s;&s;i&s;t him
with their advice and opinion. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed none of
tho&s;e arts, which were proper to gain an enthu&s;ia&s;tic
army. Murmurs being thrown out again&s;t &s;ome pro|motions,
which he had made, <HI>Would you have me,</HI> &s;aid
he, <HI>prefer none but the godly? Here is Dick Ingold&s;by,</HI> con|tinued
he, <HI>who can neither pray nor preach; yet will I tru&s;t
him before ye all</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ludlow.</NOTE>. This imprudence gave great offence
to the pretended &s;aints. The other qualities of the Pro|tector
were laudable: He was of a gentle, humane, and
generous di&s;po&s;ition. Some of his party offering to put
an end to the&s;e intrigues by the death of Lambert, if he
would give them authority, he declared, that he would
not purcha&s;e power or dominion by &s;uch &s;anguinary
mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE parliament was no le&s;s alarmed at the military
cabals. They voted, that there &s;hould be no meeting
or general council of officers without the Protector's
con&s;ent, or by his orders. This vote brought affairs
immediately to a rupture. The officers ha&s;tened to Ri|chard,
<PB N="305" REF="399">
and demanded of him the di&s;&s;olution of the par|liament.
De&s;borow, a man of a clowni&s;h and brutal
nature, threatened him if he &s;hould refu&s;e. The Pro|tector
wanted the re&s;olution to deny, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little
ability to re&s;i&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April. Richard de|po&s;ed.</NOTE> The parliament was di&s;&s;olved; and by
the &s;ame act the Protector was by every one con&s;idered
as effectually dethroned. Soon after, he &s;igned his di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion
in form.</P>
<P>HENRY, the deputy of Ireland, was endowed with
the &s;ame moderate di&s;po&s;ition as Richard; but as he en|joyed
more vigour and capacity, it was apprehended,
that he might make re&s;i&s;tance. His popularity in Ire|land
was great; and even his per&s;onal authority, not|with&s;tanding
his youth, was con&s;iderable. Had his am|bition
been very eager, he had, no doubt, been able to
create di&s;turbance: But being threatened by Sir Hardre&s;s
Waller, Colonel John Jones, and other officers, he very
quietly re&s;igned his command, and retired to England.
He had once entertained thoughts, which he had not
re&s;olution to execute, of proclaiming the King in Dub|lin
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Cate's Collections, vol. ii. p. 243.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS fell, &s;uddenly and from an enormous height,
but, by a rare fortune, without any hurt or injury, the
family of the Cromwels. Richard continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s
an e&s;tate, which was very moderate, and burdened too
with a large debt, which he had contracted for the in|terment
of his father. After the re&s;toration, tho' he
remained unmole&s;ted, he thought proper to travel for
&s;ome years; and at Pezenas in Languedoc he was in|troduced
under a borrowed name to the Prince of Conti.
That Prince, talking of Engli&s;h affairs, broke out into
admiration of Cromwel's courage and capacity. &startq;But
as for that poor pitiful fellow, Richard,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;what has become of him? How could he be &s;uch a
<PB N="306" REF="400">
blockhead as to reap no greater benefit from all his
father's crimes and &s;ucce&s;&s;es?&endq; Richard extended his
peaceful and quiet life to an extreme old age, and died
not till the latter end of Queen Anne's reign. His &s;o|cial
virtues, more valuable than the greate&s;t capacity,
met with a recompence, more precious than noi&s;y &s;ame
and more &s;uitable, contentment and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE council of officers, now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;upreme
authority, deliberated what form of government they
&s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h. Many of them feeured inclined to ex|erci&s;e
the power of the &s;word in the mo&s;t open man|ner:
but as it was apprehended, that the people would
with great difficulty be induced to pay taxes, levied by
arbitrary will and plea&s;ure; it was agreed to pre&s;erve
the &s;hadow of civil admini&s;tration, and to revive the
long parliament, which had been expelled by Cromwel.
They could not be di&s;&s;olved, it was a&s;&s;erted, but by
their own con&s;ent; and violence had interrupted, but
was not able to de&s;troy, their right to government. The
officers al&s;o expected, that as the&s;e members had &s;uffi|ciently
felt their own weakne&s;s, they would be contented
to act in &s;ubordination to the military commanders, and
would thenceforth allow all the authority to remain where
the power was &s;o vi&s;ibly ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>THE officers applied to Lenthal, the &s;peaker, and
propo&s;ed to him, that the parliament &s;hould re&s;ume their
&s;eats. Lenthal was a man of a low and timid &s;pirit;
and being uncertain what i&s;&s;ue might attend the&s;e coun|cils,
was de&s;irous of evading the propo&s;al. He replied,
that he could by no means comply with the de&s;ire of the
officers; being engaged in a bu&s;ine&s;s of a far greater im|portance
to him&s;elf, which he could not omit on any
account, becau&s;e it concerned the &s;alvation of his own
&s;oul. The officers pre&s;&s;ed him to know what it might
be. He was preparing, he &s;aid, to participate of the
<PB N="307" REF="401">
Lord's Supper; which he re&s;olved to take the next &s;ab|bath
day. They in&s;i&s;ted, that mercy was preferable to
&s;acrifice, and that he could not better prepare him&s;elf
for that great duty, than by contributing to the public
good. All their remon&s;trances had no effect. How|ever,
on the appointed day, the &s;peaker, being informed,
that a quorum of the hou&s;e was likely to meet, thought
proper, notwith&s;tanding the &s;alvation of his &s;oul, as
Ludlow ob&s;erves, to join them; and the hou&s;e imme|diately
proceeded upon bu&s;ine&s;s. The &s;ecluded members
attempted, but in vain, to re&s;ume their &s;eats among
them.</P>
<P>THE numbers of this parliament were very &s;mall,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Long parlia|ment or Rump re|&s;tored.</NOTE> little
exceeding forty members: Their authority in the na|tion,
ever &s;ince they had been purged by the army, was
extremely dimini&s;hed; and after their expul&s;ion, had
been totally annihilated: But being all of them men of
violent ambition; &s;ome of them men of experience and
capacity; they were re&s;olved, &s;ince they enjoyed the
title of the &s;upreme authority, and ob&s;erved that &s;ome
appearance of a parliament was requi&s;ite for the purpo&s;es
of the army, not to act a &s;ubordinate part to tho&s;e who
acknowleged them&s;elves their &s;ervants. They cho&s;e a
council, in which they took care that the officers of
Wallingford-hou&s;e &s;hould not be the majority: They
appointed Fleetwood to be lieutenant-general, but in|&s;erted
in his commi&s;&s;ion, that it &s;hould only continue
during the plea&s;ure of the hou&s;e: They cho&s;e &s;even per|&s;ons,
who &s;hould nominate to &s;uch commands as be|came
vacant: And they voted, that all commi&s;&s;ions
&s;hould be received from the &s;peaker, and be &s;igned by
him in the name of the parliament. The&s;e precautions,
the tendency of which was vi&s;ible, gave great di&s;gu&s;t to
the general officers; and their di&s;content would have
broke out into &s;ome re&s;olution, fatal to the parliament,
<PB N="308" REF="402">
had it not been checked by the apprehen&s;ions of danger
from the common enemy.</P>
<P>THE bulk of the nation con&s;i&s;ted of royali&s;ts and
pre&s;byterians; and to both the&s;e parties the dominion of
the pretended parliament had ever been to the la&s;t de|gree
odious. When this parliament was expelled by
Cromwel, contempt had &s;ucceeded to hatred; and no re|&s;erve
had been u&s;ed in expre&s;&s;ing the utmo&s;t deri&s;ion
again&s;t the impotent ambition of the&s;e u&s;urpers. See|$ng
them rein&s;tated in authority, all orders of men felt
the highe&s;t indignation; together with apprehen&s;ions le&s;t
&s;uch tyrannical rulers &s;hould exert their power in taking
vengeance upon their enemies, by whom they had been
&s;o openly in&s;ulted. A &s;ecret reconcilement therefore,
was made between the rival parties; and it was agreed,
that, laying a&s;ide former enmities, all efforts &s;hould be
u&s;ed for the overthrow of the Rump: For &s;o they called
the parliament, in allu&s;ion to that part of the animal
body. The pre&s;bytcrians, &s;en&s;ible from experience, that
their pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, however laudable, had carried
them into unwarrantable extremes, were willing to lay
a&s;ide former jealou&s;ies, and, at all hazards, to re&s;tore
the royal family. The nobility, the gentry bent their
mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate endeavours to the &s;ame enterprize, by
which alone they could be redeemed from &s;lavery. And no
man was &s;o remote from party, &s;o indifferent to public
good, as not to feel the mo&s;t ardent wi&s;hes, for the di&s;|&s;olution
of that tyranny, which, whether the civil or
the military part of it be con&s;idered, was equally oppre&s;|&s;ive
and ruinous to the nation.</P>
<P>MORDAUNT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy of the royali&s;ts.</NOTE> who had &s;o narrowly e&s;caped on his
trial, before the high-court of ju&s;tice, &s;eemed rather ani|mated
than daunted with pa&s;t danger; and having, by
his re&s;olute behaviour, obtained the highe&s;t confidence
of the royal party, he was now become the center of all
<PB N="309" REF="403">
their con&s;piracies. In many counties, a re&s;olution was
taken to ri&s;e in arms. Lord Willoughby of Parham and
Sir Horatio Town&s;hend undertook to &s;ecure Lynne:
General Ma&s;&s;ey engaged to &s;eize Gloce&s;ter: Lord New|port,
Littleton, and other gentlemen con&s;pired to take
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Shrew&s;bury; Sir George Booth of Che&s;ter;
Sir Thomas Middleton of North-Wales; Arundel, Pol|lard,
Granville, Trelawney, of Plymouth and Exeter.
A day was appointed for the execution of all the&s;e en|terprizes.
And the King attended by the Duke of
York, had arrived &s;ecretly at Calais, with a re&s;olution
of putting him&s;elf at the head of his loyal &s;ubjects.
The French had promi&s;ed to &s;upply him with a &s;mall
body of forces, in order to countenance the in&s;urrections
of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>THIS combination was di&s;concerted by the infidelity
of Sir Richard Willis. That traitor continued with the
parliament the &s;ame corre&s;pondence, which he had be|gun
with Cromwel. He had engaged to reveal all con|&s;piracies,
&s;o far as to de&s;troy their effect; but re&s;erved
to him&s;elf, if he plea&s;ed, the power of concealing the
con&s;pirators. He took care never to name any of the
old, genuine cavaliers, who had zealou&s;ly adhered, and
were re&s;olved &s;till to adhere, to the royal cau&s;e in every
fortune. The&s;e men he e&s;teemed; the&s;e he even loved.
He betrayed only the new converts among the pre&s;byte|rians,
or &s;uch lukewarm royali&s;ts, as, di&s;couraged with
their di&s;appointments, were re&s;olved to expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to no more hazards. A lively proof, how impo&s;|&s;ible
it is, even for the mo&s;t corrupted minds, to dive&s;t
them&s;elves of all regard to morality and &s;ocial duty!</P>
<P>MANY of the con&s;pirators in the different counties
were thrown into pri&s;on: Others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> a&s;toni&s;hed at &s;uch
&s;ymptoms of &s;ecret treachery, left their hou&s;es or re|mained
quiet: The mo&s;t tempe&s;tuous weather prevailed
during the whole time appointed for the rendevouzes;
<PB N="310" REF="404">
in&s;omuch that &s;ome found it impo&s;&s;ible to join their
friends, and others were di&s;mayed with fear and &s;uper&s;ti|tion
at an incident &s;o unu&s;ual during the &s;ummer $word$
Of all the projects, the only one which took e$$$$$ $word$
that of Sir George Booth for the &s;eizing of Che&s;ter.
The Earl of Derby, Lord Herbert of Cherbury, Mr.
Lee, Colonel Morgan took part in his enterprize. Sir
William Middleton joined him with &s;ome troops from
North Wales; and the in&s;urgents were powerful enough
to &s;ubdue all in that neighbourhood, who ventured to
oppo&s;e them. In their declaration they made no men|tion
of the King: They only demanded a free and full
parliament.</P>
<P>THE Rump were ju&s;tly alarmed. How combu&s;tible
the materials were they well knew; and the fire was
now fallen among them. Booth was of a family emi|nently
pre&s;byterian; and his conjunction with the
royali&s;ts they regarded as a mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom.
They had many officers, who&s;e fidelity they could more
depend upon than that of Lambert: But there was no|one
in who&s;e vigilance and capacity they repo&s;ed &s;uch
confidence. They commi&s;&s;ioned him to &s;uppre&s;s the in|&s;urgents.
He made incredible ha&s;te. Booth impru|dently
ventured him&s;elf out of the walls of Che&s;ter,
and expo&s;ed, in the open field, his raw troops again&s;t
the&s;e hardy veterans. He was &s;oon routed and taken
pri&s;oner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Suppre&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> His whole party were di&s;per&s;ed. And the
parliament had no farther occupation than to fill all the
pri&s;ons with their open or &s;ecret enemies. De&s;igns were
even entertained of tran&s;porting the loyal families to
Barbadoes, Jamaica, and the other colonies; le&s;t they
&s;hould propagate in England children of the &s;ame ma|lignant
affections with them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ucce&s;s ha&s;tened the ruin of the parliament.
Lambert, at the head of a body of troops, was no le&s;s
dangerous to them than Booth. A thou&s;and pounds,
<PB N="311" REF="405">
which they &s;ent him to buy a jewel, were employed by
him in liberalities to his officers. At his in&s;tigation they
drew up a petition, and tran&s;mitted it to Fleetwood, a
weak man, and an hone&s;t, if &s;incerity in folly de&s;erves
that honourable name. The import of this petition
was, that Fleetwood &s;hould be made commander in
chief, Lambert major-general, De&s;borow lieutenant-ge|neral
of the hor&s;e, Monk major-general of the foot.
To which, a demand was added, that no officer &s;hould
be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his command but by a court-martial.</P>
<P>THE parliament, alarmed at the danger, immediately
ca&s;hiered Lambert, De&s;borow, Berry, Clarke, Barrow,
Kel&s;ey, Cobbet. Sir Arthur Hazelrig propo&s;ed the im|peachment
of Lambert for high trea&s;on. Fleetwood's
commi&s;&s;ion was vacated, and the command of the army
was ve&s;ted in &s;even per&s;ons, of whom that general was
one. The parliament voted, that they would have no
more general officers. And they declared it high trea&s;on
to levy any money without con&s;ent of parliament.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e votes were feeble weapons in oppo&s;ition to
the &s;words of the &s;oldiery. Lambert drew &s;ome troops
together, in order to decide the controver&s;y. Okey,
who was leading his regiment to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the
parliament, was de&s;erted by them. Morley and Mo&s;s
brought their regiments into Palace-yard, re&s;olute to
oppo&s;e the violence of Lambert.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Octo|ber.</NOTE> But that artful general
knew an ea&s;y way of di&s;appointing them. He placed
his &s;oldiers in the &s;treets which led to We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall.
When the &s;peaker came in his coach,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament expelled.</NOTE> he ordered the
hor&s;es to be turned, and very civilly conducted him home.
The other members were in like manner intercepted.
And the two regiments in Palace-yard, finding them|&s;elves
expo&s;ed to deri&s;ion, peaceably retired to their quar|ters.
A very little before this bold enterprize, a &s;olemn
fa&s;t had been kept by the army; and it is remarked,
<PB N="312" REF="406">
that this ceremony was the u&s;ual prelude to every &s;ignal
violence which they committed.</P>
<P>THE officers found them&s;elves again inve&s;ted with &s;u|preme
authority, of which they intended for ever to re|tain
the &s;ub&s;tance, however they might be&s;tow on others
the empty &s;hadow or appearance.<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of Octo|ber.</NOTE> They elected a com|mittee
of twenty-three per&s;ons, of whom &s;even were
officers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Committee of Safety.</NOTE> The&s;e they pretended to inve&s;t with &s;overeign
authority; and called them a committee of &s;afety. They
&s;poke every where of &s;ummoning a parliament, cho&s;en
by the people; but they really took &s;ome &s;teps towards
a&s;&s;embling a military parliament, compo&s;ed of officers,
elected from every regiment in the &s;ervice<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ludlow.</NOTE>. Through|out
the three kingdoms there prevailed nothing but the
melancholy fears, to the nobility and gentry, of a bloody
ma&s;&s;acre and extermination; to the re&s;t of the people,
of perpetual &s;ervitude, beneath tho&s;e &s;anctified robbers,
who&s;e union and who&s;e divi&s;ions would be equally de|&s;tructive,
and who$ under pretence of &s;uperior illumina|tions,
would &s;oon extirpate, if po&s;&s;ible, all private mo|rality,
as they had already all public law and ju&s;tice,
from the Briti&s;h dominions.</P>
<P>DURING the time that England continued in this di|&s;tracted
condition, the other kingdoms of Europe were
ha&s;tening towards a compo&s;ure of tho&s;e differences, by
which they had &s;o long been agitated.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foreign af|fairs.</NOTE> The parliament,
while it pre&s;erved authority, in&s;tead of following the
de&s;tructive politics of Cromwel, and lending a&s;&s;i&s;tance to
the conquering Swede, embraced the prudent maxims of
the Dutch Commonwealth, and re&s;olved, in conjunction
with that &s;tate, to mediate by force of arms an accom|modation
between the northern crowns. Montague was
&s;ent with a &s;quadron to the Baltic, and carried with him
as amba&s;&s;ador Algernon Sidney, the famous republican.
<PB N="313" REF="407">
Sidney found the Swedi&s;h monarch employed in the &s;iege
of Copenhagen, the capital of his enemy; and was
highly plea&s;ed, that, with a Roman arrogance, he could
check the progre&s;s of royal victories, and di&s;play in &s;o
&s;ignal a manner the &s;uperiority of freedom above tyranny.
With the highe&s;t indignation, the ambitious Prince
was obliged to &s;ubmit to the imperious mediation of the
two Commonwealths. &startq;'Tis cruel,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;that
laws &s;hould be pre&s;cribed me by parricides and ped|lars.&endq;
But his whole army was enclo&s;ed in an i&s;land,
and might be &s;tarved by the combined &s;quadrons of
England and Holland. He was obliged therefore to
quit his prey, when he had &s;o nearly got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
it; and having agreed to a pacification with Denmark,
retired into his own country, where he &s;oon after
died.</P>
<P>THE wars between France and Spain were al&s;o con|cluded
by the treaty of the Pyrenees. The&s;e bloody
animo&s;ities had long been carried on between the rival
&s;tates, even while governed by a &s;i&s;ter and brother, who
cordially loved and e&s;teemed each other. But politics,
which had &s;o long prevailed over the&s;e friendly affections,
now at la&s;t yielded to their influence; and never was
the triumph more full and compleat. The Spani&s;h Low
Countries, if not every part of that monarchy, lay al|mo&s;t
entirely at the mercy of its enemy. Broken ar|mies,
di&s;ordered finances, &s;low and irre&s;olute councils;
by the&s;e re&s;ources alone were the di&s;per&s;ed provinces of
Spain defended again&s;t the vigorous power of France.
But the Queen regent, anxious for the fate of her bro|ther,
employed her authority with the cardinal to &s;top
the progre&s;s of the French conque&s;ts, and put an end to
a quarrel, which, being commenced by ambition, and
attended with victory, was at la&s;t concluded with mo|deration.
The young monarch of France, tho' a&s;piring
<PB N="314" REF="408">
and warlike in his character, was at this time entirely
occupied in the plea&s;ures of love and gallantry, and had
pa&s;&s;ively re&s;igned the reins of the empire into the hands
of his politic mini&s;ter. And he remained an uncon|cerned
&s;pectator; while an opportunity for conque&s;t was
parted with, which he never was able, during the whole
cour&s;e of his active reign, fully to retrieve.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;ters of the two crowns, Mazarine and Don
Louis de Haro, met at the foot of the Pyrenees, in the
I&s;le of Phea&s;ants, a place which was &s;uppo&s;ed to belong
to neither kingdom. The negotiation being brought to
an i&s;&s;ue by frequent conferences between the mini&s;ters,
the Monarchs them&s;elves agreed to a congre&s;s; and the&s;e
two &s;plendid courts appeared in their full lu&s;tre amid&s;t
tho&s;e &s;avage mountains. Philip brought his daughter,
Mary There&s;e, along with him; and giving her in mar|riage
to his nephew, Louis, endeavoured to cement by
this new tye the incompatible intere&s;ts of the two mo|narchies.
The French King made a &s;olemn renuncia|tion
of every &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which might accrue to him in
right of his &s;pou&s;e; a vain formality, too weak to
re&s;train the ungoverned ambition of Princes.</P>
<P>THE affairs of England were in &s;o great di&s;order,
that it was not po&s;&s;ible to comprehend that kingdom in
the treaty, or adju&s;t mea&s;ures with a power, which was
in &s;uch ince&s;&s;ant fluctuation. The King, reduced to
de&s;pair by the failure of all enterprizes for his re&s;tora|tion,
was re&s;olved to try the weak re&s;ource of foreign
&s;uccours; and he went to the Pyrenees at the time when
the two mini&s;ters were in the mid&s;t of their negotiations.
Don Louis received him with that generous civility,
peculiar to his nation; and expre&s;&s;ed great inclination,
had the low condition of Spain allowed him, to give a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Monarch. The cautious Ma|zarine,
pleading the alliance of France with the Engli&s;h
Commonwealth, refu&s;ed even to &s;ee him; and though
<PB N="315" REF="409">
it is pretended, that the King offered to marry the Car|dinal's
niece, he could, for the pre&s;ent, obtain nothing
but empty profe&s;&s;ions of re&s;pect and prote&s;tations of &s;er|vice.
The condition of that Monarch, to all the
world, &s;eemed totally de&s;perate. His friends had been
baffled in every attempt for his &s;ervice: The &s;caffold had
often &s;treamed with the blood of the mo&s;t active royali&s;ts:
The &s;pirts of many were broke with tedious impri&s;on|ments:
The e&s;tates of all were burthened by the fines and
confi&s;cations which had been levied from them: None dur&s;t
openly avow them&s;elves of that party: And &s;o &s;mall did
their number &s;eem to a &s;uperficial view, that even &s;hould
the nation recover its liberty, which was e&s;teemed no
wi&s;e probable, it was judged uncertain what form of
government it would embrace. But amid&s;t all the&s;e
gloomy pro&s;pects, fortune, by a &s;urprizing revolution,
was now paving the way for the King to mount in
peace and triumph the throne of his ance&s;tors. It was
by the prudence and loyalty of General Monk, that this
happy change was at la&s;t accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>GEORGE MONK, to whom the fate was re&s;erved of
re-e&s;tabli&s;hing monarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General Monk.</NOTE> and fini&s;hing the bloody di&s;|&s;en&s;ions
of the three kingdoms, was the &s;econd &s;on of a
family in Devon&s;hire, antient and honourable, but
lately, from too great ho&s;pitality and expence, &s;ome|what
fallen to decay. He betook him&s;elf, very early in
his youth, to the profe&s;&s;ion of arms; and was engaged
in the unfortunate expeditions to Cadiz and the i&s;le of
Rh&eacute;. After England had concluded peace with all its
neighbours, he &s;ought military experience in the Low
Countries, the great &s;chool of war to all the European
nations; and he ro&s;e to the command of a company
under Lord Goring. This company con&s;i&s;ted of 200
men, of whom a hundred were volunteers, often gentle|men
of family and e&s;tate, &s;ometimes noblemen, who
lived upon their own fortunes in a &s;plendid manner.
<PB N="316" REF="410">
Such a military turn at that time prevailed among the
Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;ound of war was fir&s;t heard in this i&s;land,
Monk returned to England, partly de&s;irous of promo|tion
in his native country, partly di&s;gu&s;ted with &s;ome
ill u&s;age from the States, of which he found rea&s;on to
complain. Upon the Scots pacification, he was em|ployed
by the earl of Leice&s;ter again&s;t the Iri&s;h rebels;
and having obtained a regiment, was &s;oon taken notice of,
for his military &s;kill and for his calm and deliberate va|lour.
Without o&s;tentation, expence, or care&s;&s;es, merely
by his humane and equal temper, he gained the good|will
of all the &s;oldiery; and with a mixture of familia|rity
and affection, they u&s;ually called him <HI>hone&s;t George
Monk;</HI> an honourable appellation, which they &s;till con|tinued
to him, even during his greate&s;t elevation. He
was remarkable for his moderation in party; and while
all around him were enflamed into rage again&s;t the op|po&s;ite
faction, he fell under &s;u&s;picion from the candour
and tranquillity of his behaviour. When the Iri&s;h army
was called over into England, &s;urmi&s;es of this kind had
been &s;o far credited, that he had even been &s;u&s;pended
from his command, and ordered to Oxford, that he
might an&s;wer the charge laid again&s;t him. His e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
character for truth and &s;incerity here &s;tood him
in great &s;tead; and upon his earne&s;t prote&s;tations and
declarations, he was &s;oon re&s;tored to his regiment,
which he joined at the &s;iege of Nantwich. The very
next day after his arrival, Fairfax attacked and defeated
the royali&s;ts, commanded by Biron; and took Colonel
Monk pri&s;oner. He was &s;ent to the Tower, where he
endured, above two years, all the rigors of poverty and
confinement. The King, however, was &s;o mindful as
to &s;end him, notwith&s;tanding his own difficulties, a pre|&s;ent
of a 100 guineas; but it was not till after the
royali&s;ts were totally &s;ubdued, that he recovered his li|berty.
<PB N="317" REF="411">
Monk, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, had always refu&s;ed
the mo&s;t inviting offers from the parliament: But
Cromwel, &s;en&s;ible of his merit, having &s;ollicited him to
engage in the wars again&s;t the Iri&s;h, who were con&s;ider|ed
as rebels both by King and parliament; he was not
unwilling to repair his broken fortunes by accepting a
command, which, he flattered him&s;elf, was reconcilable
to the &s;tricte&s;t principles of honour. Having once en|gaged
with the parliament, he was obliged to obey or|ders;
and found him&s;elf nece&s;&s;itated to fight both again&s;t
the Marque&s;s of Ormond in Ireland, and again&s;t the
King him&s;elf in Scotland. Upon the reduction of this
la&s;t kingdom, Monk was left with the &s;upreme com|mand;
and by the equality and ju&s;tice of his admini|&s;tration
he was able to give contentment to that re&s;tle&s;s
people, now reduced to &s;ubjection by a nation whom
they hated. No le&s;s acceptable was his authority to the
officers and &s;oldiers; and fore&s;eeing, that the good will
of the army under his command might &s;ome time be of
great &s;ervice to him, he had, with much care and &s;uc|ce&s;s,
cultivated their friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE connexions, which he had formed with Crom|wel,
his benefactor, pre&s;erved him faithful to Richard,
who had been enjoined by his father to follow in every
thing the directions of General Monk. When the long
parliament was re&s;tored, Monk, who was not prepared
for oppo&s;ition, acknowleged their authority, and was
continued in his command, from which it would not
have been &s;afe to attempt the di&s;lodging him. After the
army had expelled the parliament, he prote&s;ted again&s;t
the violence, and re&s;olved,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk de|clares for the parliament.</NOTE> as he pretended, to vindi|cate
their invaded privileges. Deeper de&s;igns, either in
the King's favour or his own, were from the beginning
&s;u&s;pected to be the motive of his actions.</P>
<P>A RIVALSHIP had long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and
Lambert: and every body &s;aw the rea&s;on why he op|po&s;ed
<PB N="318" REF="412">
him&s;elf to the advancement of that ambitious ge|neral,
by who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s his own authority, he knew,
would &s;oon be &s;ubverted. But little friend&s;hip had ever
been maintained between him and the parliamentary
leaders; and it &s;eemed no wi&s;e probable, that he in|tended
to employ his indu&s;try, and &s;pend his blood for
the advancement of one enemy above another. How
early he entertained de&s;igns for the King's re&s;toration,
we know not with certainty: It is likely, that, as &s;oon
as Richard was depo&s;ed, he fore&s;aw, that, without &s;uch
an expedient, it would be impo&s;&s;ible ever to bring the
nation to a regular &s;ettlement. His elder and younger
brothers were entirely devoted to the royal cau&s;e: The
Granvilles, his near relations, and all the re&s;t of his
kindred, were in the &s;ame intere&s;t: He him&s;elf was in|toxicated
with no fumes of enthu&s;ia&s;m; and had main|tained
no connexions with any of the fanatical tribe.
His early engagements had been with the King, and he
had left that &s;ervice without receiving any di&s;gu&s;t from
the royal family. Since he had inli&s;ted him&s;elf with
the oppo&s;ite party, he had been guilty of no violence or
rigor, which might render him obnoxious. His return,
therefore, to loyalty was ea&s;y and open; and nothing
could be &s;uppo&s;ed to counterballance his natural propen|&s;ity
to that mea&s;ure, except the views of his own ele|vation,
and the pro&s;pect of u&s;urping the &s;ame grandeur
and authority, which had been a&s;&s;umed by Cromwel.
But from &s;uch exorbitant, if not impo&s;&s;ible projects, the
natural tranquillity and moderation of his temper, the
calmne&s;s and &s;olidity of his genius, and his limited ca|pacity,
not to mention his age, now upon the decline,
&s;eem to have &s;et him at a di&s;tance. Cromwel him&s;elf,
he always a&s;&s;erted<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gumble's life of Monk, p. 93.</NOTE>, could not long have maintained
his u&s;urpation; and any other per&s;on, even equal to
him in genius, it was obvious, would now find it more
<PB N="319" REF="413">
difficult to practi&s;e arts, of which every one, from expe|rience,
was &s;ufficiently aware. It is more agreeable,
therefore, to rea&s;on as well as candor to &s;uppo&s;e, that
Monk, &s;o &s;oon as he put him&s;elf in movement, had en|tertained
views of effectuating the King's re&s;toration;
nor ought any objections, derived from his profound
&s;ilence even to Charles him&s;elf, be regarded as con&s;ider|able.
His temper was naturally re&s;erved, his circum|&s;tances
required di&s;&s;imulation, the King he knew was
&s;urrounded with &s;pies and traitors; and upon the whole
it &s;eems hard to interpret that conduct, which ought to
exalt our idea of his prudence, as a di&s;paragement of his
probity.</P>
<P>SIR John Granville, hoping that the General would
engage in the King's &s;ervice, &s;ent into Scotland his
younger brother, a clergyman, Dr. Monk, who car|ried
him a letter and invitation from the King. When
the Doctor arrived, he found, that his brother was then
holding a council of officers, and was not to be &s;een for
&s;ome hours. In the mean time, he was received and
entertained by Price, the General's chaplain, a man of
probity, as well as a partizan of the King's. The Doc|tor
having an entire confidence in the chaplain, talked
very freely with him about the object of his journey,
and engaged him, if there &s;hould be occa&s;ion, to &s;econd
his applications. At la&s;t, the General arrives; the bro|thers
embrace; and after &s;ome preliminary conver&s;a|tion,
the Doctor opens his bu&s;ine&s;s. Monk interrupts
him to know, whether he had ever before to any body
mentioned the &s;ubject of his journey. &startq;To no body,&endq;
replied his brother, &startq;but to Price, whom I know to
be entirely in your confidence.&endq; The General, al|tering
his countenance, changed the di&s;cour&s;e; and
would enter into no farther confidence with him, but
&s;ent him away with the fir&s;t opportunity. He would
not tru&s;t his own brother the moment he knew that he
<PB N="320" REF="414">
had di&s;clo&s;ed the &s;ecret; though to a man whom he
him&s;elf could have tru&s;ted<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;down's defence of General Monk.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>His conduct in all other particulars was full of the
&s;ame re&s;erve and prudence; and no le&s;s was requi&s;ite
for effecting the difficult work which he had undertaken.
All the officers in his army, of whom he entertained any
&s;u&s;picion, he immediately ca&s;hiered: Cobbet, who had
been &s;ent by the Committee of Safety, under pretence
of communicating their re&s;olutions to Monk, but really
with a view of debauching his army, he committed to
cu&s;tody: He drew together the &s;everal &s;cattered regi|ments:
He &s;ummoned an a&s;&s;embly, &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling
a convention of e&s;tates in Scotland; and having
communicated his re&s;olution of marching into England,
he received from them a &s;ea&s;onable, though no great
&s;upply of money.</P>
<P>HRARING that Lambert was advanced northward
with his army, Monk &s;ent Cloberry and two other com|mi&s;&s;ioners
to London with large profe&s;&s;ions of his incli|nation
to peace, and with offers of terms for an accom|modation.
His chief aim was to obtain delay, and re|lax
the preparations of his enemies. The Committee
of Safety fell into the &s;nare. A treaty was &s;igned by
the commi&s;&s;ioners; but Monk refu&s;ed to ratify it, and
complained that his commi&s;&s;ioners had exceeded their
powers. He de&s;ired however to enter into a new nego|tiation
at Newca&s;tle. The Committee willingly ac|cepted
this fallacious offer.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">November.</NOTE> MEANWHILE the&s;e military &s;overeigns found them|&s;elves
&s;urrounded on all hands with inextricable difficul|ties.
The nation had fallen into a total anarchy; and by
refu&s;ing the payment of all taxes, reduced the army to the
greate&s;t nece&s;&s;ities. While Lambert's forces were a&s;|&s;embling
at Newca&s;tle, Hazelrig and Morley took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
<PB N="321" REF="415">
of Port&s;mouth, and declared for the parliament.
A party &s;ent to &s;uppre&s;s them, were per&s;uaded by their
commander to join in the &s;ame declaration. The city
apprentices ro&s;e in a tumult, and demanded a free
parliament. Though they were &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by Colonel
Hew&s;on, a man who from the profe&s;&s;ion of a cobler had
ri&s;en to a high rank in the army, the city &s;till di&s;covered
&s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t dangerous di&s;content. It even
e&s;tabli&s;hed a kind of &s;eparate government, and a&s;&s;umed
the &s;upreme authority within it&s;elf. Admiral Lau&s;on
with his &s;quadron came into the river, and declared for
the parliament. Hazelrig and Morley, hearing of this
important event, left Port&s;mouth, and advanced to|wards
London. The regiments near that city, being
&s;ollicited by their old officers, who had been ca&s;hiered
by the Committee of Safety, revolted again to the par|liament.
De&s;borow's regiment, being &s;ent by Lambert
to &s;upport his friends, no &s;ooner arrived at St. Alba$$s,
than it declared for the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>FLEETWOOD'S hand was found too weak and un&s;table
to &s;upport this ill-founded fabric, which, every where
around him, was falling into ruins. When he received
intelligence of any murmurs among the &s;oldiers, he
would fall upon his knees in prayer, and could hardly
be prevailed with to join the troops. Even when among
them, in the mid&s;t of any di&s;cour&s;e, he would invite
them all to prayers, and put him&s;elf on his knees be|fore
them. If any of his friends exhorted him to more
vigor, they could get no other an&s;wer, than that God
had &s;pit in his face, and would not hear him. Men
now cea&s;ed to wonder, why Lambert had promoted him
to the office of General, and had been contented him|&s;elf
with the &s;econd command in the army.</P>
<P>LENTHAL, the &s;peaker, being invited by the officers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">26th of De|cember.</NOTE>
again a&s;&s;umed authority, and &s;ummoned together the
parliament, which twice before had been expelled with
<PB N="322" REF="416">
&s;o much reproach and ignominy. As &s;oon as a&s;&s;embled,
they repealed their act again&s;t the payment of exci&s;e
and cu&s;toms; they appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for a&s;&s;ign|ing
quarters to the army;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament re&s;tored.</NOTE> and without taking any no|tice
of Lambert, they &s;ent orders to the forces under his
command immediately to repair to tho&s;e garri&s;ons, which
were appointed them.</P>
<P>LAMBERT was now in a very di&s;con&s;olate condition.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1660.</NOTE>
Monk,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Janu|ary.</NOTE> he &s;aw, had pa&s;&s;ed the Tweed at Cold&s;tream,
and was advancing upon him. His own &s;oldiers de|&s;erted
him in great multitudes, and joined the enemy.
Lord Fairfax too, he heard, had rai&s;ed forces behind
him, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of York, without declaring
his purpo&s;e. The la&s;t orders of the parliament &s;o en|tirely
&s;tripped him of his army, that there remained not
with him above 100 hor&s;e: All the re&s;t went to their
quarters with quietne&s;s and re&s;ignation; and him&s;elf
was, &s;ome time after, committed to the Tower. The
other officers of the army, who had formerly been
ca&s;hiered by the parliament, and had re&s;umed their
commands that they might &s;ubdue that a&s;&s;embly, were
again ca&s;hiered and confined to their own hou&s;es. Sir
Harry Vane and other members, who had concurred
with the Committee of Safety, were ordered into a like
confinement. And the parliament now &s;eemed to be
again po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more ab&s;olute authority than ever,
and to be without any danger of oppo&s;ition or contra|diction.</P>
<P>THE republican party was at this time headed by two
men, Hazelrig and Vane, who were of very oppo&s;ite
characters, and mortally hated each other. Hazelrig,
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed greater authority in the parliament, was
haughty, imperious, precipitate, vain-glorious; with|out
civility, without prudence; qualified only by his
noi&s;y, pertinacious ob&s;tinacy to acquire an a&s;cendant in
<PB N="323" REF="417">
public councils. Vane was noted, in all civil tran&s;ac|tions,
for temper, in&s;inuation, addre&s;s, and a profound
judgment; in all religious &s;peculations, for folly and
extravagance. He was a perfect enthu&s;ia&s;t; and fancy|ing
that he was certainly favoured with in&s;piration, he
deemed him&s;elf, to &s;peak in the language of the times,
to be a <HI>man above ordinances,</HI> and by rea&s;on of his per|fection,
to be unlimited and unre&s;trained by any rules,
which govern inferior mortals. The&s;e whim&s;ies, ming|ling
with pride, had &s;o corrupted his excellent under|&s;tanding,
that &s;ometimes he thought him&s;elf the per&s;on
deputed to reign on earth for a thou&s;and years over the
whole congregation of the faithful<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>MONK, though informed of the re&s;toration of the
parliament, from whom he received no orders, &s;till ad|vanced
with his army, which was near 6000 men: The
&s;cattered forces in England were above four times more
numerous. Fairfax, who had re&s;olved to declare for the
King, not being able to make the General open his in|tentions,
retired to his own hou&s;e in York&s;hire. In all
countries through which Monk pa&s;&s;ed, the prime gen|try
flocked to him with addre&s;&s;es, expre&s;&s;ing their ear|ne&s;t
de&s;ire, that he would be in&s;trumental in re&s;toring
the nation to peace and tranquillity, and to the enjoy|ment
of tho&s;e liberties, which by law were their birth|right,
but of which, during &s;o many years, they had
been fatally bereaved: And that, in order to this &s;alu|tary
purpo&s;e, he would prevail, either for the re&s;toring
tho&s;e members, who had been &s;ecluded before the
King's death, or for the election of a new parliament,
who might, legally and by general con&s;ent, again go|vern
the nation. Though Monk pretended not to fa|vour
the&s;e addre&s;&s;es, that ray of hope, which the know|ledge
of his character and &s;ituation afforded, mightily
animated all men. The tyranny and the anarchy,
<PB N="324" REF="418">
which now equally oppre&s;&s;ed the kingdom; the expe|rience
of pa&s;t di&s;tractions, the fear of future convul|&s;ions,
the indignation again&s;t military u&s;urpation,
again&s;t &s;anctified hypocri&s;y: All the&s;e motives had unit|ed
every party, except the mo&s;t de&s;perate, into ardent
wi&s;hes for the King's re&s;toration, the only remedy for
all the&s;e fatal evils.</P>
<P>SCOT and Robin&s;on were &s;ent as deputies by the par|liament,
under pretence of congratulating the General,
but in reality to &s;erve as &s;pies upon him. The city di&s;|patched
four of their principal citizens to perform like
compliments; and at the &s;ame time to confirm the Ge|neral
in his inclination to a free parliament, the object
of all men's prayers and endeavours. The authority of
Monk could &s;carce &s;ecure the parliamentary deputies
from tho&s;e in&s;ults, which the general hatred and con|tempt
towards their ma&s;ters drew from men of every
rank and denomination.</P>
<P>MONK continued his march with few intervals till he
came to St. Albans. He there &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the
parliament, de&s;iring them to remove from London tho&s;e
regiments, who, though they now profe&s;&s;ed to return
to their duty, had &s;o lately offered violence to that a&s;|&s;embly.
This me&s;&s;age was unexpected, and exceed|ingly
perplexed the hou&s;e. Their fate, they found,
mu&s;t &s;till depend on a mercenary army; and they were
as di&s;tant as ever from their imaginary &s;overeignty.
However, they found it nece&s;&s;ary to comply. The &s;ol|diers
made more difficulty. A mutiny aro&s;e among
them. One regiment in particular, which was quartered
in Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, expre&s;sly refu&s;ed to yield their place
to the northern army. But tho&s;e officers, who would
gladly, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, have inflamed the quarrel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Febru|ary.</NOTE>
were ab&s;ent or in confinement; and for want of leaders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Monk enters London.</NOTE>
the &s;oldiers were at la&s;t, with great reluctance, obliged
<PB N="325" REF="419">
to comply. Monk with his army took quarters at
We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>THE General was introduced to the hou&s;e; and
thanks were given him by Lenthal for the eminent &s;er|vices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE>
which he had done his country. Monk was a
prudent, but not an eloquent &s;peaker. He told the
hou&s;e, that the &s;ervices, which he had been enabled to
perform, were no more than his duty, and merited not
&s;uch prai&s;es as tho&s;e with which they were plea&s;ed to
honour him: That among many per&s;ons of greater
worth, who bore their commi&s;&s;ion, he had been em|ployed
as the in&s;trument of providence for effecting their
re&s;toration; but he con&s;idered this &s;ervice only as a &s;tep
to more important &s;ervices, which it was their part to
render to the nation: That as he marched along, he
ob&s;erved all ranks of men, in all places, to be in earne&s;t
expectation of a &s;ettlement, after the violent convul&s;ions,
to which they had been expo&s;ed; and to have no pro|&s;pect
of &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing but from the di&s;&s;olution of the
pre&s;ent parliament, and from the &s;ummoning of a new
one, free and full, who, meeting without oaths or en|gagements,
might finally give contentment to the na|tion:
That applications had been made to him for that
purpo&s;e; but that he, &s;en&s;ible of his duty, had &s;till told
the petitioners, that the parliament it&s;elf, which was
now free and would &s;oon be full, was the be&s;t judge of
all the&s;e mea&s;ures, and that the whole community ought
to acquie&s;ce in their determination: That though he
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in this manner to the people, he mu&s;t
now freely inform the hou&s;e, that the fewer engage|ments
were exacted, the more comprehen&s;ive would
their plan prove, and the more &s;atisfaction would it
give to the nation: And that it was &s;ufficient for pub|lic
&s;ecurity, if the fanatic party and the royali&s;ts were
excluded; &s;ince the principles of the&s;e factions were
de&s;tructive either of government or of liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="326" REF="420">
THIS &s;peech, containing matter, which was both
agreeable and di&s;agreeable to the hou&s;e as well as to the
nation, &s;till kept every one in&s;u&s;pence, and upheld that
uncertainty, in which it &s;eemed the General's intere&s;t
to retain the public. But it was impo&s;&s;ible for the
kingdom to remain long in this doubtful &s;ituation: The
people, as well as the parliament, pu&s;hed matters to a
deci&s;ion. During the late convul&s;ions, the payment of
taxes had been interrupted; and though the parliament,
upon their a&s;&s;embling, renewed the ordinances for all
collections and impo&s;itions, yet &s;o little reverence did
the people pay tho&s;e legi&s;lators, that they gave very
&s;low and unwilling obedience to their commands. The
common council of London flatly refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to
an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, required of them; and declared, that, till
a free and lawful parliament impo&s;ed taxes, they never
would deem it their duty to make any payment. This
re&s;olution would immediately have put an end to the
dominion of the parliament: They were determined,
therefore, upon this occa&s;ion to make at once a full ex|periment
of their own power and of their General's obe|dience.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> MONK received orders to march into the city, to
&s;eize twelve per&s;ons the mo&s;t obnoxious to the parlia|ment,
to remove the po&s;ts and chains from all the
&s;treets, and to take down and break the portculli&s;es and
gates of the city: And very few hours were allowed
him to deliberate upon the execution of the&s;e violent
orders. To the great &s;urprize and con&s;termation of all
men, Monk prepared him&s;elf for obedience. Neglect|ing
the entreaties of his friends, the remon&s;trances of
his officers, the cries of the people, he entered the city
in a military manner; he apprehended as many as he
could of the pro&s;cribed per&s;ons, whom he &s;ent to the
Tower; with all the circum&s;tances of contempt he
broke the gates and portculli&s;es; and having expo&s;ed
<PB N="327" REF="421">
the city to the &s;corn and deri&s;ion of all who hated it, he
returned in triumph to his quarters in We&s;tmin&s;ter.</P>
<P>NO &s;ooner had the General lei&s;ure to reflect, than he
found, that this la&s;t mea&s;ure, in&s;tead of being a conti|nuation
of that cautious ambiguity, which he had hi|therto
maintained, was taking party without re&s;erve,
and laying him&s;elf, as well as the nation, at the mercy
of that tyrannical parliament, who&s;e power had long
been odious, as well as their per&s;ons contemptible, to
all men. He re&s;olved therefore, before it was too late,
to repair the dangerous mi&s;take, into which he had
been betrayed, and to &s;how the whole world, &s;till more
without re&s;erve, that he meant no longer to be the mi|ni&s;ter
of violence and u&s;urpation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> After complaining of
the odious &s;ervice, in which he had been employed; he
wrote a letter to the hou&s;e, reproaching them, as well
with the new cabals which they had formed with Vane
and Lambert, as with the encouragement given to a fa|natical
petition pre&s;ented by Barebone; and he required
them, in the name of the citizens, &s;oldiers, and whole
Commonwealth, to i&s;&s;ue writs within a week for the
filling their hou&s;e, and to fix the time for their own
di&s;&s;olution and the a&s;&s;embling of a new parliament.
Having di&s;patched this letter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declares for a free parlia|ment.</NOTE> which might be regard|ed,
he thought, as an undoubted pledge of his &s;incerity,
he marched with his army into the city, and de&s;ired
Allen, the mayor, to &s;ummon a common-council at
Guildhall. He there made many apologies for the in|dignity,
which, two days before, he had been obliged
to put upon them; a&s;&s;ured them of his per&s;everance in
the mea&s;ures which he had adopted; and de&s;ired that
they might mutually plight their faith for a &s;trict union
between city and army, in every enterprize for the hap|pine&s;s
and &s;ettlement of the Commonwealth.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the joy and exultation,
which di&s;played it&s;elf throughout the city, as &s;oon as
<PB N="328" REF="422">
intelligence was conveyed of this happy mea&s;ure, em|braced
by the General. The pro&s;pect of peace, con|cord,
liberty, ju&s;tice, broke forth at once, from amid&s;t
the deepe&s;t darkne&s;s, in which the nation had ever
been involved. The view of pa&s;t calamities no longer
pre&s;ented di&s;mal progno&s;tics of the future: It tended
only to inhance the general exultation for tho&s;e &s;cenes
of happine&s;s and tranquillity, which all men now con|fidently
promi&s;ed them&s;elves. The royali&s;ts, the pre&s;|byterians,
forgetting all animo&s;ities, mingled in com|mon
joy and tran&s;port, and vowed never more to gratify
the ambition of fal&s;e and factious tyrants, by their cala|mitous
divi&s;ions. The populace, more outrageous in
their fe&s;tivity, made the whole air re&s;ound with accla|mations,
and illuminated every &s;treet with &s;ignals of
jollity and triumph. Applau&s;es of the General were
every where intermingled with dete&s;tation again&s;t the
parliament. The mo&s;t ridiculous inventions were
adopted, in order to expre&s;s this latter pa&s;&s;ion. At
every bonfire rumps were roa&s;ted; and where the&s;e
could no longer be found, pieces of fle&s;h were cut into
that &s;hape: And the funeral of the parliament (the po|pulace
exclaimed) was celebrated by the&s;e &s;ymbols of
hatred and deri&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE parliament, though in the agonies of de&s;pair,
made &s;till one effort for the recovery of their dominion.
They &s;ent a committee with offers to gain the Gene|ral.
He refu&s;ed to hear them except in the pre&s;ence of
&s;ome of the &s;ecluded members. Though &s;everal per|&s;ons,
de&s;perate from guilt and fanatici&s;m, promi&s;ed to
inve&s;t him with the dignity of &s;upreme magi&s;trate and to
&s;upport his government, he would not hearken to &s;uch
wild propo&s;als. Having fixed a clo&s;e corre&s;pondence
with the city, and e&s;tabli&s;hed its militia in hands,
who&s;e fidelity could be relied on, he marched again
with his army to We&s;tmin&s;ter, and pur&s;ued every pro|per
<PB N="329" REF="423">
mea&s;ure for the &s;ettlement of the nation. While
he &s;till pretended to maintain republican principles, he
was taking large &s;teps towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of
the antient monarchy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ecluded members, upon the General's invita|tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of Fe|bruary. Secluded members re|&s;tored.</NOTE>
went to the Hou&s;e, and finding no longer any
ob&s;truction, they entered, and immediately appeared to
be the majority: Mo&s;t of the independants left the
place. The re&s;tored members fir&s;t repealed all the or|ders,
by which they had been excluded: They gave
Sir George Boothe and all his party their liberty and
e&s;tates: They renewed and enlarged the General's com|mi&s;&s;ion:
They fixed an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for the &s;upport of the
fleet and army: And having pa&s;&s;ed the&s;e votes for the
pre&s;ent compo&s;ure of the kingdom,<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of March. Long parlia|ment di&s;|&s;olved.</NOTE> they di&s;&s;olved them|&s;elves,
and gave orders for the immediate a&s;&s;embling of
a new parliament. This la&s;t mea&s;ure had been previ|ou&s;ly
concerted with the General, who knew, that all
men, however different in affections, expectations, and
de&s;igns, united in their dete&s;tation of the long parlia|ment.</P>
<P>A COUNCIL OF STATE was e&s;tabli&s;hed, con&s;i&s;ting of
men of dignity and moderation; mo&s;t of whom, during
the civil wars, had made a great figure among the pre&s;|byterians.
The militia of the kingdom was put into
&s;uch hands as would promote order and &s;ettlement.
The&s;e, conjoined with Monk's army, which lay united
at London, were e&s;teemed a &s;ufficient check on the more
numerous, though di&s;per&s;ed army, of who&s;e inclinations
there was &s;till much rea&s;on to be diffident. Monk,
however, was every day removing the more obnoxious
officers, and bringing the troops to a &s;tate of di&s;cipline
and obedience.</P>
<P>OVERTON, governor of Hull, had declared his re&s;o|lution
to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fortre&s;s till the coming
<PB N="330" REF="424">
of King Je&s;us: But when Alured produced the autho|rity
of the parliament for his delivering the place to Co|lonel
Fairfax, he thought proper to comply.</P>
<P>MONTAGUE, who commanded the fleet in the Bal|tic,
had entered into the &s;ame con&s;piracy with Sir
George Boothe; and pretending want of provi&s;ions, had
&s;ailed from the Sound towards the coa&s;t of England,
with an intention of &s;econding that enterprize of the
royali&s;ts. On his arrival he received the news of
Boothe's defeat, and the total failure of the in&s;urrection.
The great difficulties to which the parliament was re|duced,
allowed them no lei&s;ure to examine &s;trictly the
rea&s;ons, which he gave for quitting his &s;tation; and they
allowed him to retire peaceably to his country hou&s;e.
The Council of State now conferred on him, in con|junction
with Monk, the command of the fleet; and
&s;ecured the naval, as well as military force in hands fa|vourable
to the public &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the&s;e &s;teps, which were
taking towards the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of monarchy, Monk
&s;till maintained the appearance of zeal for a Common|wealth,
and hitherto allowed no canal of corre&s;pon|dence
between him&s;elf and the King to be opened. To
call a free parliament, and to re&s;tore the royal family,
were vi&s;ibly, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the kingdom,
one and the &s;ame mea&s;ure: Yet would not the General
declare, otherways than by his actions, that he had
adopted the King's intere&s;t; and nothing but nece&s;|&s;ity,
at la&s;t extorted the confe&s;&s;ion from him. His
&s;ilence, in the commencement of his enterprize, ought
to be no objection to his &s;incerity; &s;ince he maintained
the &s;ame re&s;erve, at a time, when, con&s;i&s;tent with com|mon
&s;en&s;e, he could have entertained no other purpo&s;e<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">After Monk's declaration for a free parliament on the 11th of February, he could mean nothing but the King's re&s;toration: Yet it was long before he would open him&s;elf even to the King. This declaration was within eight days after his arrival in London. Had he ever intended to have &s;et up him|&s;elf, he would not &s;urely have &s;o &s;oon abandoned a project &s;o inviting: He would have taken &s;ome &s;teps, which would have betrayed it. It could only have been &s;ome di&s;appointment, &s;ome fru&s;trated attempt, which could have made him renounce the road of private ambition. But there is not the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of &s;uch intentions. The &s;tory told of Sir Anthony A&s;hley Cooper, by Mr. Locke, has not any appearance of truth. See Lord Lan&s;down's Vin|dication, and Philips's Continuation of Baker. I &s;hall add to what tho&s;e au|thors have advanced, that Cardinal Mazarine wi&s;hed for the King's re&s;tora|tion; though he would not have ventured much to have procured it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="425">
THERE was one Morrice, a gentleman of Devon|&s;hire,
of a &s;edentary, &s;tudious di&s;po&s;ition, nearly re|lated
to Monk, and one who had always maintained the
&s;tricte&s;t intimacy with him. With this friend alone did
Monk deliberate concerning that great enterprize,
which he had formed. Sir John Granville, who had a
commi&s;&s;ion from the King, applied to Morrice for ac|ce&s;s
to the General; but received for an&s;wer, that the
General de&s;ired him to communicate his bu&s;ine&s;s to
Morrice. Granville, though importunately urged,
twice refu&s;ed to deliver his me&s;&s;age to any but Monk
him&s;elf; and that cautious politician, finding him now
a per&s;on, who&s;e &s;ecre&s;y could be &s;afely tru&s;ted, admit|ted
him to his pre&s;ence, and opened to him his whole
intentions. Still he &s;crupled to commit any thing to
paper<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Lan&s;downe, Clarendon.</NOTE>: He delivered only a verbal me&s;&s;age by Gran|ville,
a&s;&s;uring the King of his &s;ervices, giving advice
for his conduct, and exhorting him in&s;tantly to leave
the Spani&s;h territories, and retire into Holland. He
was ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive le&s;t Spain might retain him as
a pledge for the recovery of Dunkirk and Jamaica.
Charles followed the&s;e directions, and very narrowly
e&s;caped to Breda. Had he protracted his journey a few
hours, he had certainly, under pretence of honour and
re&s;pect, been arre&s;ted by the Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="426">
LOCKHART, who was governor of Dunkirk, and no
wi&s;e aver&s;e to the King's &s;ervice, was applied to on
this occa&s;ion. The &s;tate of England was &s;et before him,
the certainty of the re&s;toration repre&s;ented, and the
pro&s;pect of great favour di&s;played, if he would antici|pate
the vows of the kingdom, and receive the King
into his garri&s;on. Lockhart &s;till replied that his com|mi&s;&s;ion
was derived from an Engli&s;h parliament, and be
would not open his gates but in obedience to the &s;ame
authority<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>. The &s;cruple, though in the pre&s;ent emer|gence
it approaches towards &s;uper&s;tition, it is difficult
for us entirely to condemn.</P>
<P>THE elections for the new parliament went every
where in favour of the King's party. This was one of
tho&s;e popular torrents, where the mo&s;t indifferent, or
even the mo&s;t aver&s;e, are tran&s;ported with the general
pa&s;&s;ion, and zealou&s;ly adopt the &s;entiments of the &s;o|ciety,
to which they belong. The enthu&s;ia&s;ts them|&s;elves
&s;eemed to be di&s;armed of their fury; and between
de&s;pair and a&s;toni&s;hment gave way to tho&s;e mea&s;ures,
which, they found, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them, by
their utmo&s;t efforts, to with&s;tand. The pre&s;byterians,
the royali&s;ts, being united, formed the voice of the na|tion,
which, without noi&s;e, but with infinite ardour,
called for the King's re&s;toration. The kingdom was
almo&s;t entirely in the hands of the former party; and
&s;ome zealous leaders among them began to renew the
demand of tho&s;e conditions, which had been required of
the late King in the treaty of Newport: But the gene|ral
opinion &s;eemed to condemn all tho&s;e rigorous and
jealous capitulations with their &s;overeign. Harra&s;&s;ed
with convul&s;ions and di&s;orders, men ardently longed for
repo&s;e, and were terrified with the mention of negotia|tions
or delay, which might afford opportunity to the
&s;editious army &s;till to breed new confu&s;ion. The pa&s;|&s;ion
<PB N="333" REF="427">
too for liberty, having been carried to &s;uch violent
extremes, and having produced &s;uch bloody commo|tions,
began, by a natural movement, to give place to
a &s;pirit of loyalty and obedience; and the public were
le&s;s zealous in a cau&s;e, which was become odious, on
account of the calamities which had &s;o long attended it.
After the conce&s;&s;ions made by the late King, the con|&s;titution
&s;eemed to be &s;ufficiently &s;ecured; and the ad|ditional
conditions in&s;i&s;ted on, as they had been framed
during the greate&s;t ardour of the conte&s;t, amounted ra|ther
to an annihilation than a limitation of monarchy.
Above all, the General was aver&s;e to the mention of
conditions; and re&s;olved, that the crown, which he in|tended
to re&s;tore, &s;hould be conferred on the King en|tirely
free and unincumbered. Without farther &s;cruple,
therefore, or jealou&s;y, the people gave their voice in
elections for &s;uch as they knew to entertain &s;entiments
favourable to monarchy; and all payed court to a party,
which, they fore&s;aw, was &s;oon to govern the nation.
Though the parliament had voted, that no one &s;hould
be elected, who had him&s;elf, or who&s;e father had borne
arms for the late King; very little regard was any
where payed to this ordinance. The leaders of the
pre&s;byterians, the Earl of Manche&s;ter, Lord Fairfax,
Lord Roberts, Hollis, Sir Anthony A&s;hley Cooper,
Anne&s;ley, Lewis, were determined to atone for pa&s;t
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions by their pre&s;ent zeal for the royal inte|re&s;ts;
and from former merits, &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and &s;uffer|ings,
they had acquired with their party the highe&s;t cre|dit
and authority.</P>
<P>THE affairs of Ireland were in a condition no le&s;s
favourable to the King. As &s;oon as Monk declared
again&s;t the Engli&s;h army, he di&s;patched emi&s;&s;aries into
Ireland, and engaged the officers in that kingdom to
concur with him in the &s;ame mea&s;ures. Lord Broghill,
<PB N="334" REF="428">
Pre&s;ident of Mun&s;ter, and Sir Charles Coote, Pre&s;ident
of Connaught, went &s;o far as to enter into a corre&s;pon|dence
with the King, and to promi&s;e their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for
his re&s;toration. In conjunction with Sir Theophilus
Jones, and other officers, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
government, and excluded Ludlow, who was zealous
for the parliament, but whom they pretended to be in a
confederacy with the Committee of Safety. They kept
them&s;elves in readine&s;s to &s;erve the King; but made no
declarations, till they &s;hould &s;ee the turn, which affairs
took in England.</P>
<P>BUT all the&s;e promi&s;ing views had almo&s;t been bla&s;ted
by an untoward accident. Upon the admi&s;&s;ion of the
&s;ecluded members, the republican party, particularly
the late King's judges, were &s;eized with the ju&s;te&s;t de|&s;pair,
and endeavoured to infu&s;e the &s;ame &s;entiments into
the whole army. By them&s;elves or their emi&s;&s;aries,
they repre&s;ented to the &s;oldiers, that all tho&s;e brave ac|tions,
which had been performed during the war, and
which were &s;o meritorious in the eyes of the parlia|ment,
would no doubt be regarded as the deepe&s;t crimes
by the royali&s;ts, and would expo&s;e the army to the &s;e|vere&s;t
vengeance. That in vain did that party make
profe&s;&s;ions of moderation and lenity: The King's
death, the execution of &s;o many of the nobility and
gentry, the &s;eque&s;trations and impri&s;onment of the re&s;t,
were in their eyes crimes &s;o deep, and offences &s;o per|&s;onal,
as mu&s;t be pro&s;ecuted with the mo&s;t implacable
re&s;entment. That the lo&s;s of all arrears, the ca&s;heering
every officer and &s;oldier, were the lighte&s;t puni&s;hment,
which mu&s;t be expected: After the di&s;per&s;ion of the
army, no farther protection remained to them, either
for life or property, but the clemency of enraged ene|mies.
And that, even, if the mo&s;t perfect &s;ecurity
could be obtained, it was inglorious to be reduced, by
<PB N="335" REF="429">
treachery and deceit, to &s;ubjection under a foe, who,
in the open field, had &s;o often yielded to their &s;uperior
valour.</P>
<P>AFTER the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions had been infu&s;ed into the
army, Lambert &s;uddenly made his e&s;cape from the
Tower, and threw Monk and the Council of State into
the greate&s;t con&s;ternation. They knew Lambert's
vigour and activity; they were acquainted with his
great popularity in the army; they were &s;en&s;ible, that,
though the &s;oldiers had lately de&s;erted him, they &s;uffi|ciently
expre&s;&s;ed their remor&s;e and their dete&s;tation of
tho&s;e, who, by fal&s;e profe&s;&s;ions, they found, had &s;o
egregiou&s;ly deceived them. It &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary, there|fore,
to employ the greate&s;t celerity in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing &s;o
dangerous an enemy: Colonel Ingold&s;by, who had
been named one of the late King's judges, but who was
now entirely engaged in the royal cau&s;e, was di&s;patch|ed
after him. He overtook him at Daventry, while he
had yet a&s;&s;embled but four troops of hor&s;e. One of
them de&s;erted him. Another quickly followed the ex|ample.
He him&s;elf, endeavouring to make his e&s;cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April.</NOTE>
was &s;eized by Ingold&s;by, to whom he made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions
not &s;uitable to his former character of &s;pirit and valour.
Okey, Axtel, Cobbet, Crede, and other officers of that
party were taken pri&s;oners with him. All the roads
were full of &s;oldiers ha&s;tening to join them. In a few
days they would have been very formidable. And it
was thought, that it might prove dangerous for Monk
him&s;elf to have a&s;&s;embled any con&s;iderable body of his
republican army for their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion: So that nothing
could be more happy than the &s;udden extinction of this
ri&s;ing flame.</P>
<P>WHEN the parliament met, they cho&s;e Sir Harbottle
Grim&s;tone &s;peaker,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of April.</NOTE> a man, who, though he had for
&s;ome time concurred with the late parliament, had long
<PB N="336" REF="430">
been e&s;teemed affectionate to the King's &s;ervice. The
great dangers, incurred during the former u&s;ur$$$$ns,
joined to the extreme caution of the Gene$$, kept
every one in awe; and no one dared, for &s;ome days, to
make any mention of the King. The members chiefly
exerted their &s;pirit in bitter invectives again&s;t the me|mory
of Cromwel, and in execrations upon the inhu|man
murther of their late Sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of May.</NOTE> At la&s;t, the Ge|neral,
having &s;ufficiently &s;ounded their inclinations,
gave directions to Anne&s;ley, pre&s;ident of the council, to
inform them, that one Sir John Granville, a &s;ervant of
the King's, had been &s;ent over by his Maje&s;ty, and was
now at the door with a letter to the Commons.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The re&s;tora|tion.</NOTE> The
loude&s;t acclamations were excited by this intelligence.
Granville was called in: The letters, accompanied with
a declaration, greedily read: Without one moment's
delay, and without a contradictory vote, a committee
was appointed to prepare an an&s;wer: And in order to
&s;pread the &s;ame &s;atisfaction throughout the kingdom, it
was voted that the letter and declaration &s;hould imme|diately
be publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE people, freed from that &s;tate of &s;u&s;pence in
which they had &s;o long been held, now changed their
anxious hope for the unmixt effu&s;ions of joy; and di&s;|played
a &s;ocial triumph, and exultation, which no pri|vate
pro&s;perity, even the greate&s;t, is ever able fully to
in&s;pire. Traditions remain of men who died for plea|&s;ure,
when informed of this happy and &s;urpri&s;ing event.
The King's declaration was well calculated to uphold
the &s;atisfaction, in&s;pired by the pro&s;pect of public &s;ettle|ment.
It offered a general amne&s;ty to all per&s;ons what|&s;oever;
and that without any exceptions but &s;uch as
&s;hould afterwards be made by parliament: It promi&s;ed a
liberty of con&s;cience; and a concurrence in any act of
parliament, which, upon mature deliberation, &s;hould
be offered, for the in&s;uring that indulgence: The en|quiry
<PB N="337" REF="431">
into all grants, purcha&s;es, and alienations, it &s;ub|mitted
to the arbitration of the &s;ame a&s;&s;embly: And it
a&s;&s;ured the &s;oldiers of all their arrears, and promi&s;ed
them, for the future, the &s;ame pay which they then en|joyed.</P>
<P>THE Lords, perceiving the &s;pirit, by which the
kingdom as well as the Commons were animated, ha&s;t|ened
to re-in&s;tate them&s;elves in their antient authority,
and to take their &s;hare in the &s;ettlement of the n$$ion.
They found the doors of their hou&s;e open; and all
were admitted, even &s;uch as had formerly been excluded
on account of their pretended delinquency.</P>
<P>THE two hou&s;es attended; while the King was pro|claimed
with great &s;olemnity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of May.</NOTE> in Palace-Yard, at
Whitehall, and at Temple-Bar. The Commons voted
500 pounds to buy a jewel for Granville, who had
brought them the King's gracious me&s;&s;ages: A pre&s;ent
of 50,000 pounds was conferred on the King, 10,000
pounds on the Duke of York, 5000 pounds on the
Duke of Gloce&s;ter. A committee of Lords and Com|mons
was di&s;patched to invite his Maje&s;ty to return and
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his dominions. The rapidity, with
which all the&s;e events were conducted, was marvellous,
and di&s;covered the pa&s;&s;ionate zeal and entire unanimity
of the nation. Such an impatience appeared, and &s;uch
an emulation, in Lords, and Commons, and City, who
&s;hould make the mo&s;t lively expre&s;&s;ions of their joy
and duty; that, as the noble hi&s;torian expre&s;&s;es it, a
man could not but wonder where tho&s;e people dwelt,
who had done all the mi&s;chief, and kept the King &s;o
many years from enjoying the comfort and &s;upport of
&s;uch excellent &s;ubjects. The King him&s;elf &s;aid, that it
mu&s;t &s;urely have been his own fault, that he had not
&s;ooner taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne; &s;ince he found
every body &s;o zealous for promoting his happy re&s;tora|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="338" REF="432">
THE re&s;pect of foreign powers &s;oon followed the &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
of the King's &s;ubjects. Spain invited him to
return to the Low Countries, and embark in &s;ome of
their maritime towns. France made prote&s;tations of af|fection
and regard, and offered Calais for the &s;ame pur|po&s;e.
The States-General &s;ent deputies with a like
friendly invitation. The King re&s;olved to accept of
this la&s;t offer. The people of the republic bore him a
very cordial affection; and politics no longer re&s;trained
their magi&s;trates from promoting and expre&s;&s;ing that
&s;entiment. As he pa&s;&s;ed from Breda to the Hague, he
was attended with numerous crowds, and was received
with the loude&s;t acclamations; as if them&s;elves, not their
rivals in power and commerce, were now re&s;tored to
peace and &s;ecurity. The States-General in a body,
and afterwards the States of Holland apart, performed
their compliments with the greate&s;t &s;olemnity: Every
per&s;on of di&s;tinction was ambitious of being introduced
to his Maje&s;ty; all amba&s;&s;adors and public mini&s;ters of
kings, princes, or &s;tates, repaired to him, and profe&s;&s;ed
the joy of their ma&s;ters on his behalf: So that one
would have thought, that, from the united efforts of
Chri&s;tendom, had been derived this revolution, which
diffu&s;ed every where &s;uch univer&s;al &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h fleet came in &s;ight of Scheveling. Mon|tague
had not waited for orders from the parliament;
but had per&s;uaded the officers, of them&s;elves, to tender
their duty to his Maje&s;ty. The Duke of York imme|diately
went on board, and took the command of the
fleet as Lord High Admiral.</P>
<P>WHEN the King di&s;embarked at Dover, he was met
by the General, whom he cordially embraced. Never
&s;ubject in fact, probably in his intentions, had de&s;erved
better of his King and country. In the &s;pace of a few
months, without effu&s;ion of blood, by his cautious and
<PB N="339" REF="433">
di&s;intere&s;ted conduct alone, he had be&s;towed &s;ettlement
on three kingdoms, which had long been torne with
the mo&s;t violent convul&s;ions: And having ob&s;tinately
refu&s;ed the mo&s;t inviting conditions, offered him by the
King as well as by every party in the kingdom, he
freely re&s;tored his injured ma&s;ter to the vacant throne.
The King entered London on the 29th of May, which
was al&s;o his birth-day.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of May</NOTE> The fond imaginations of
men interpreted as a happy omen the concurrence of
two &s;uch joyful periods.</P>
<P>AT this aera, it may be proper to &s;top for a moment,
and take a general &s;urvey of the age, &s;o far as re|gards
manners, finances, arms, commerce, arts and
&s;ciences. The chief u&s;e of hi&s;tory is, that it affords

<P>NO people could undergo a change more &s;udden and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners and arts.</NOTE>
entire in their manners than did the Engli&s;h nation dur|ing
this period. From tranquillity, concord, &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion,
&s;obriety, they pa&s;&s;ed in an in&s;tant to a &s;tate of
faction, fanatici&s;m, rebellion, and almo&s;t frenzy. The
violence of the Engli&s;h parties exceeded any thing,
which we can now imagine: Had they continued but a
little longer, there was ju&s;t rea&s;on to dread all the hor|rors
of the antient ma&s;&s;acres and pro&s;criptions. The
military u&s;urpers, who&s;e authority was founded on
<PB N="340" REF="434">
palpable inju&s;tice, and was &s;upported by no national
party, would have been impelled by rage and de&s;pair
into &s;uch &s;anguinary mea&s;ures; and if the&s;e furious
expedients had been embraced on one &s;ide, revenge would
naturally have pu&s;hed the other party, after a return
of power, to retaliate upon their enemies. No &s;ocial
intercour&s;e was maintained between the parties; no
marriages or alliances contracted. The royali&s;ts,
though oppre&s;&s;ed, harra&s;&s;ed, per&s;ecuted, di&s;dained all
affinity with their ma&s;ters. The more they were re|duced
to &s;ubjection, the greater &s;uperiority did they
affect above tho&s;e u&s;urpers, who by violence and in|ju&s;tice
had acquired an a&s;cendant over them.</P>
<P>THE manners of the two factions were as oppo&s;ite as
tho&s;e of the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations. &startq;Your friends, the
Cavaliers,&endq; &s;aid a parliamentarian to a royali&s;t, &startq;are
very di&s;&s;olute and debauched.&endq; &startq;Yes&endq; replied the
royali&s;ts, &startq;they have the infirmities of men: But your
friends, the roundheads, have the vices of devils,
tyranny, rebellion, and &s;piritual pride<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Sir Philip Warwic.</NOTE>.&endq; Riot and
di&s;order, it is certain, notwith&s;tanding the good ex|ample
&s;et them by Charles the fir&s;t, prevailed very
much among his partizans. Being commonly men of
birth and fortune, to whom exce&s;&s;es are le&s;s pernicious
than to the vulgar, they were too apt to indulge them|&s;elves
in all plea&s;ures, particularly tho&s;e of the table.
Oppo&s;ition to the rigid preci&s;ene&s;s of their antagoni&s;ts
increa&s;ed their inclination to good-fellow&s;hip; and the
character of a man of plea&s;ure was affected among
them, as a &s;ure pledge of attachment to the church and
monarchy. Even when ruined by confi&s;cations and &s;e|que&s;trations,
they endeavoured to maintain the appear|ance
of a carele&s;s and &s;ocial jollity. &startq;As much as
hope is &s;uperior to fear,&endq; &s;aid a poor and merry ca|valier,
<PB N="341" REF="435">
&startq;&s;o much is our &s;ituation preferable to that of
our enemies. We laugh while they tremble.&endq;</P>
<P>THE gloomy enthu&s;ia&s;m, which prevailed among
great numbers of the parliamentary party, is &s;urely the
mo&s;t curious &s;pectacle pre&s;ented by any hi&s;tory; and
the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, as well as entertaining, to a phi|lo&s;ophical
mind. All recreations were in a manner &s;u&s;|pended
by the rigid &s;everiy of the pre&s;byterians and
independants. Hor&s;e-races and cock-matches were
prohibited as the greate&s;t enormities<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Killing no Murder.</NOTE>. Even bear|baiting
was e&s;teemed heatheni&s;h and unchri&s;tian: The
&s;port of it, not the inhumanity, gave offence. Colonel
Hew&s;on, from his pious zeal, marched with his regi|ment
into London, and de&s;troyed all the bears, which
were there kept for the diver&s;ion of the citizens. This
adventure &s;eems to have given birth to the fiction of
Hudibras. Though the Engli&s;h nation be naturally
candid and &s;incere, hypocri&s;y prevailed beyond any ex|ample
in antient or modern times. The religious hy|pocri&s;y,
it may be remarked, is of a &s;ingular nature;
and being generally unknown to the per&s;on him&s;elf,
though more dangerous, it implies le&s;s fal&s;hood than
any other &s;pecies of in&s;incerity. The Old Te&s;tament,
preferably to the New, was the favourite of all the &s;ec|taries.
The ea&s;tern poetical &s;tyle of that compo&s;ition
made it more ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of a turn, which was
agreeable to them.</P>
<P>WE have had occa&s;ion, in the cour&s;e of this work,
to &s;peak of many of the &s;ects, which prevailed in Eng|land:
To enumerate them all would be impo&s;&s;ible.
The quakers, however, are &s;o con&s;iderable, at lea&s;t &s;o
&s;ingular, as to merit &s;ome attention; and as they en|tirely
renounced by principle the u&s;e of arms, they
<PB N="342" REF="436">
never made &s;uch a figure in public tran&s;actions as to
enter into any part of our narration.</P>
<P>THE religion of the quakers began with the lowe&s;t
vulgar, and, in its progre&s;s, came at la&s;t to compre|hend
people of better quality and fa&s;hion. George
Fox, born at Drayton in Lanca&s;hire in 1624, was the
founder of this &s;ect. He was the &s;on of a weaver, and
was him&s;elf bound apprentice to a &s;hoemaker. Feel|ing
a &s;tronger turn towards &s;piritual contemplations
than towards that mechanical profe&s;&s;ion, he le&s;t his
ma&s;ter, and went about the country, cloathed in a
leathern doublet, a dre&s;s, which he long affected, as
well for its &s;ingularity as its cheapne&s;s. That he might
wean him&s;elf entirely from &s;ublunary objects, he broke
off all connexions with his friends and family, and
never &s;tayed a moment in one place; le$t habitude
&s;hould beget new connexions, and depre&s;s the &s;ublimity
of his aerial meditations. He frequently wandered into
the woods, and pa&s;&s;ed whole days in hollow trees,
without other company or amu&s;ement than his bible.
Having reached that pitch of perfection that he needed
no other book, he &s;oon advanced to another &s;tate of
&s;piritual progre&s;s, and began to pay le&s;s regard even to
that divine compo&s;ition it&s;elf. His own brea&s;t, he
imagined, was full of the &s;ame in&s;piration, which had
guided the prophets and apo&s;tles them&s;elves; and by
this inward light mu&s;t every &s;piritual ob&s;curity be
cleared, by this living &s;pirit mu&s;t the dead letter be
animated.</P>
<P>WHEN he had been &s;ufficiently con&s;ecrated in his
own imagination, he felt that the fumes of &s;elf-applau&s;e
&s;oon di&s;&s;ipate, if not continually &s;upplied by the admi|ration
of others; and he began to &s;eek pro&s;elytes. Pro|&s;elytes
were ea&s;ily gained, at a time when all mens af|fections
were turned towards religion, and when the
<PB N="343" REF="437">
mo&s;t extravagant modes of it were &s;ure to be the mo&s;t
popular. All the forms of ceremony, invented by pride
and o&s;tentation, Fox and his di&s;ciples, from a &s;uperior
pride and o&s;tentation, carefully rejected: Even the or|dinary
rites of civility were &s;hunned, as the nouri&s;h|ment
of carnal vanity and &s;elf-conceit. They would
be&s;tow no titles of di&s;tinction: The name of <HI>friend</HI> was
the only &s;alutation, with which they indi&s;criminately
acco&s;ted every one. To no per&s;on would they make a
bow, or move their hat, or give any &s;igns of reverence.
In&s;tead of that affected adulation, introduced into mo|dern
tongues, of &s;peaking to individuals as if they were
a multitude, they returned to the &s;implicity of antient
languages; and <HI>thou</HI> and <HI>thee</HI> were the only expre&s;&s;ions,
which, on any con&s;ideration, they could be brought to
employ.</P>
<P>DRESS too, a mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
the members of this &s;ect. Every &s;uperfluity and
ornament was carefully retrenched: No plaits to their
coat, no buttons to their &s;leeves: No lace, no ruffles,
no embroidery. Even a button to the hat, though
&s;ometimes u&s;eful, yet not being always &s;o, was univer|&s;ally
rejected by them with horror and indignation.</P>
<P>THE violent enthu&s;ia&s;m of this &s;ect, like all high
pa&s;&s;ions, being too &s;trong for the weak nerves to &s;u&s;tain,
threw the preachers into convul&s;ions, and &s;hakings, and
di&s;tortions in their limbs; and they thence received the
denomination of <HI>quakers.</HI> Amid&s;t the great toleration,
which was then granted to all &s;ects, and even encou|ragement
given to all innovation, this &s;ect alone &s;uf|fered
per&s;ecution. From the fury of their zeal, the
quakers broke into churches, di&s;turbed public wor&s;hip,
and harra&s;&s;ed the mini&s;ter and audience with railing and
reproaches. When carried before a magi&s;trate, they re|fu&s;ed
him all reverence, and treated him with the &s;ame
familiarity as if he had been their equal. Sometimes they
<PB N="344" REF="438">
were thrown into mad-hou&s;es, &s;ometimes into pri&s;on:
Sometimes whipped, &s;ometimes pilloryed. The patience
and magnanimity, with which they &s;uffered, begot
compa&s;&s;ion, admiration, e&s;teem<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">The following &s;tory is told by Whitlocke, p. 599. Some quakers at Ha&s;ington in Northumberland coming to the mini&s;ter on the &s;abbath day, and &s;peaking to him, the people fell upon the quakers, and almo&s;t killed one or two of them, who going out fell on their knees, and prayed God to pardon the people, who knew not what they did; and afterwards &s;peaking to the people, &s;o convinced them of the evil they had done in beating them, that the country people &s;ell a quarrelling, and beat one another more than they had before beaten the quakers.</NOTE>. A &s;upernatural &s;pirit
was believed to &s;upport them under tho&s;e &s;ufferings,
which the ordinary &s;tate of humanity, freed from the
illu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion, is unable to &s;u&s;tain.</P>
<P>THE quakers crept into the army: But as they
preached univer&s;al peace, they &s;educed the military zea|lots
from their profe&s;&s;ion, and would &s;oon, had they
been &s;uffered, have put an end, without any defeat or
calamity, to the dominion of the &s;aints. The&s;e attempts
became a fre&s;h ground of per&s;ecution, and a new cau&s;e
for their progre&s;s among the people.</P>
<P>MORALS with this &s;ect were carried, or affected to
be carried, to the &s;ame degree of extravagance as reli|gion.
Give a quaker a blow on one cheek, he held
up the other: A&s;k his cloke, he gave you his coat al&s;o:
The greate&s;t intere&s;t could not engage him, in any
court of judicature, to &s;wear even to the truth: He
never a&s;ked more for his wares than the preci&s;e &s;um,
which he was determined to accept. This la&s;t maxim
is laudable, and continues &s;till to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erved
by that &s;ect.</P>
<P>NO fanatics ever carried farther the hatred of ceremo|nies,
forms, orders, rites, in&s;titutions. Even bapti&s;m
and the Lord's &s;upper, by all other &s;ects believed to be
interwoven with the very vitals of chri&s;tianity, were
di&s;dainfully rejected by them. The very &s;abbath they
<PB N="345" REF="439">
profaned. The holine&s;s of churches they derided; and
would give to the&s;e &s;acred edifices no other appellation
than that of <HI>&s;hops</HI> or <HI>&s;teeple-hou&s;es.</HI> No prie&s;ts were ad|mitted
in their &s;ect: Every one had received from im|mediate
illumination a character much &s;uperior to the
&s;acerdotal. When they met for divine wor&s;hip, each
ro&s;e up in his place, and delivered the extemporary in|&s;pirations
of the &s;pirit: Women al&s;o were admitted to
teach the brethren, and were con&s;idered as proper vehi|cles
to convey the dictates of the Holy Gho&s;t. Some|times
a great many preachers were moved to &s;peak at
once: Sometimes a total &s;ilence prevailed in their con|gregations.</P>
<P>SOME quakers attempted to fa&s;t forty days in imitation
of Chri&s;t; and one of them bravely peri&s;hed in the ex|periment<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 624.</NOTE>.
A female quaker came naked into the
church where the Protector &s;ate; being moved by the
&s;pirit, as &s;he &s;aid, to appear <HI>as a &s;ign</HI> to the people. A
number of them fancied, that the renovation of all
things had commenced, and that cloaths were to be re|jected
together with other &s;uperfluities. The &s;uffer|ings,
which followed the practice of this doctrine, were
a &s;pecies of per&s;ecution not well calculated for promot|ing
it.</P>
<P>JAMES NAYLOR was a quaker, noted for bla&s;phemy,
or rather madne&s;s, in the time of the Protector&s;hip.
He fancied that he him&s;elf was transformed into Chri&s;t,
and was become the real Saviour of the world; and in
con&s;equence of this frenzy, he endeavoured to imitate
many actions of our Saviour related in the evangeli&s;ts.
As he bore a re&s;emblance to the common pictures of
Chri&s;t; he allowed his beard to grow in a like form:
He pretended to rai&s;e a per&s;on from the dead<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Harleyan Mi&s;cellany, vol. vi. p. 399.</NOTE>: He en|tered
Bri&s;tol, mounted on a hor&s;e; I &s;uppo&s;e, from the
<PB N="346" REF="440">
difficulty in that place of finding an a&s;s: His di&s;ciples
&s;pread their garments before him, and cried, &startq;Ho&s;anna
to the highe&s;t; holy, holy is the Lord God of Sab|baoth.&endq;
When carried before the magi&s;trates, he
would give no other an&s;wers to all que&s;tions than
&startq;thou ha&s;t &s;aid it.&endq; What is remarkable, the parlia|ment
thought that the matter de&s;erved their attention.
About ten days they &s;pent in enquiries and debates about
him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. v. p. 708.</NOTE>. They condemned him to be pilloried, whipt,
burned in the face, and to have his tongue bored thro'
with a red hot iron. All the&s;e &s;everities he bore with
the u&s;ual patience. So far his delu&s;ion &s;upported him.
But the &s;equel &s;poiled all. He was &s;ent to Bridewell,
confined to hard labour, fed on bread and water, de|barred
from all his di&s;ciples, male and female. His il|lu&s;ions
di&s;&s;ipated; and after &s;ome time, he was con|tented
to come out an ordinary man, and return to
his ordinary occupations.</P>
<P>THE chief taxes in England, during the time of the
Commonwealth, were the monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, the ex|ci&s;e,
and the cu&s;toms. The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments were levied on
per&s;onal e&s;tates as well as on land<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Scobel. p. 419.</NOTE>; and commi&s;&s;ioners
were appointed in each county for rating the indivi|duals.
The highe&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment amounted to 120,000
pounds a month in England; the lowe&s;t was 35000.
The a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments in Scotland were &s;ometimes 10,000
pounds a month<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. ii. p. 476.</NOTE>; commonly 6000. Tho&s;e on Ire|land
9000. At a medium, this tax might have afforded
about a million a year. The exci&s;e, during the civil
wars, was levied on bread, fle&s;h-meat, as well as beer,
ale, &s;trong-waters, and many other commodities. After
the King was &s;ubdued, bread and fle&s;h-meat were ex|empted
from exci&s;e. The cu&s;toms on exportation were
lowered in 1656<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Scobel, p. 376.</NOTE>. In 1650, commi&s;&s;ioners were ap|pointed
<PB N="347" REF="441">
to levy both cu&s;toms and exci&s;es. Cromwel in
1657 returned to the old practice of farming. Eleven
hundred thou&s;and pounds were then offered, both for
cu&s;toms and exci&s;e, a greater &s;um than had ever been
levyed by the commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. vi. p. 425.</NOTE>. The whole of the taxes
during that period might at a medium amount to above
two millions a year; a &s;um, which, though mode|rate,
much exceeded the revenue of any former King.
Seque&s;trations, compo&s;itions, &s;ale of crown and church
lands, and of the lands of delinquents, yielded al&s;o con|&s;iderable
&s;ums, but very difficult to be e&s;timated.
Church lands are &s;aid to have been &s;old at a million<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Dr. Walker, p. 14.</NOTE>.
None of the&s;e were ever valued at above ten or eleven
years purcha&s;e<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 753.</NOTE>. Delinquents' e&s;tates amounted to
above 200,000 pounds a year<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. Cromwel died above
two millions in debt<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. vol. vii. p. 667.</NOTE>; though the parliament had left
him in the trea&s;ury above 500,000 pounds; and in
&s;tores, the value of 700,000 pounds<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">World's Mi&s;take in Oliver Cromwel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Committee of Danger in April 1648, voted to
rai&s;e the army to 40,000 men<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 298.</NOTE>. The &s;ame year, the
pay of the army was e&s;timated at 80,000 pounds a
month<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 378.</NOTE>. The e&s;tabli&s;hment of the army in 1652, was
in Scotland 15,000 foot, 2580 hor&s;e, 560 dragoons;
in England, 4700 foot, 2520 hor&s;e, garri&s;ons 6154. In
all, 31,519, be&s;ides officers<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Journal, 2d of December, 1652.</NOTE>. The army in Scotland
was afterwards con&s;iderably reduced. The army in
Ireland was not much &s;hort of 20,000 men; &s;o that
upon the whole, the Commonwealth maintained in
1652 a &s;tanding army of more than 50,000 men. Its
pay amounted to a yearly &s;um of 1,047,715 pounds<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.
Afterwards the Protector reduced the e&s;tabli&s;hment to
<PB N="348" REF="442">
30,000 men; as appears by the In&s;trument of Govern|ment
and Humble Petition and Advice. His frequent
enterprizes obliged him from time to time to augment
them. Richard had on foot in England an army of
13258 men, in Scotland 9506, in Ireland about 10,000
men<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Journal, 6th of April, 1659.</NOTE>. The foot &s;oldiers had commonly a &s;hilling a
day<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Thurloe, vol. i. p. 395. vol. ii. p. 414.</NOTE>. The hor&s;e had two &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; &s;o
that many gentlemen and younger brothers of good fa|mily
inli&s;ted in the Protector's cavalry<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gumble's Life of Monk.</NOTE>. No wonder,
that &s;uch men were aver&s;e from the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of
civil government, by which, they well knew, they mu&s;t
be deprived of &s;o gainful a profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>ABOUT the time of the battle of Worce&s;ter, the par|liament
had on foot about 80,000 men, partly mili$ia,
partly regular forces. The vigour of the Common|wealth,
and the great capacity of tho&s;e members, who
had a&s;&s;umed the admini&s;tration, never at any time ap|peared
&s;o con&s;picuous<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Whitlocke, p. 477.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE whole revenue of the public during the Protec|tor&s;hip
of Richard was e&s;timated at 1,868,717 pounds:
His annual expences at 2,201,540 pounds. An addi|tional
revenue was demanded of the parliament<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Journal, 7th of April, 1659.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE commerce and indu&s;try of England increa&s;ed
extremely during the peaceable period of Charles's reign:
The trade to the Ea&s;t-Indies and to Guinea became
con&s;iderable. The Engli&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed almo&s;t the &s;ole
trade with Spain. Seven hundred thou&s;and pounds a
a year in bullion were coined in the Engli&s;h mint.
Twenty thou&s;and cloths were annually &s;ent to Turkey<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Stafford's Let|ters, vol. i. p. 421, 423, 430, 467.</NOTE>.
Commerce met with interruption, no doubt, from the
civil wars and convul&s;ions, which afterwards prevailed;
<PB N="349" REF="443">
though it &s;oon recovered after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the
Commonwealth. The war with the Dutch, by di&s;tre&s;|&s;ing
the commerce of &s;o formidable a rival, &s;erved to en|courage
trade in England: The Spani&s;h war was in an
equal degree pernicious. All the effects of the Engli&s;h
merchants, to an immen&s;e value, were con$i&s;cated in
Spain. The prevalence of democratical principles en|gaged
the country gentlemen to $ind their &s;ons appren|tices
to merchants<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Clarendon.</NOTE>; and commerce has ever &s;ince been
more honourable in England than in any other Euro|pean
kingdom. The exclu&s;ive companies, which for|merly
confined trade, were never expre&s;sly aboli&s;hed by
any ordinance of parliament during the Commonwealth;
but as men payed no regard to the prerogative, whence
the charter of the&s;e companies were derived, the mo|nopoly
was gradually invaded, and commerce increa&s;ed
by the increa&s;e of liberty. Intere&s;t in 1650 was reduced
to $ix per cent.</P>
<P>THE colony of New England increa&s;ed by means of
the puritans, who fled thither, in order to free them|&s;elves
from the con&s;traint, which Laud and the church
party had impo&s;ed upon them; and before the com|mencement
of the civil wars, it is &s;uppo&s;ed to have con|tained
25,000 &s;ouls<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Briti&s;h Empire in America, vol. i. p. 372.</NOTE>. For a like rea&s;on, the catholics,
afterwards, who found them&s;elves expo&s;ed to many hard|&s;hips,
and dreaded &s;till wor&s;e treatment, went over to
America in great numbers, and &s;ettled the colony of
Maryland.</P>
<P>BEFORE the civil wars, learning and the fine arts
were favoured at court, and a good ta&s;te began to pre|vail
in the nation. The King loved pictures, &s;ometimes
handled the pencil him&s;elf, and was a good judge of the
art. The pieces of foreign ma&s;ters were bought up at a
va&s;t price; and the value of pictures doubled in Europe
by the emulation between Charles and Philip IV. of
<PB N="350" REF="444">
Spain, who was touched with the &s;ame elegant pa&s;&s;ion.
Vandyke was care&s;&s;ed and enriched at court. Inigo
Jones was ma&s;ter of the King's buildings; though af|terwards
per&s;ecuted by the parliament on account of the
part, which he had in rebuilding St. Paul's, and for
obeying &s;ome orders of council, by which he was di|rected
to pull down hou&s;es, in order to make room for
that fabric. Laws, who had not been &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by any
mu&s;ician before him, was much beloved by the King,
who called him the father of mu&s;ic. Charles was a
good judge of writing, and was e&s;teemed by &s;ome more
anxious with regard to purity of &s;tyle than became a
monarch<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Burnet's Hi&s;tory of his own Times.</NOTE>. Notwith&s;tanding his narrow revenue, and
his freedom from all vanity, he lived in &s;uch magnifi|cence,
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed four and twenty palaces, all of
them elegantly and compleatly furni&s;hed; in&s;omuch,
that, when he removed from one to another, he was
not obliged to tran&s;port any thing along with him.</P>
<P>CROMWEL, though him&s;elf a barbarian, was not in|&s;en&s;ible
to literary merit. U&s;her, notwith&s;tanding his
being a bi&s;hop, received a pen&s;ion from him. Marvel
and Milton were in his &s;ervice. Waller, who was his
relation, was care&s;&s;ed by him. That poet always &s;aid,
that the Protector him&s;elf was not &s;o wholly illiterate as
was commonly imagined. He gave a hundred pounds a
year to the divinity profe&s;&s;or at Oxford; and an hi&s;to|rian
mentions this bounty as an in&s;tance of his love of
literature<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Neale's Hi&s;tory of the P$$$tans, vol. iv. p. 123.</NOTE>. He intended to have erected a college at

<P>CIVIL WARS, e&s;pecially when founded on principles
of liberty, are not commonly unfavourable to the arts of
$loquence and compo&s;ition; or rather, by pre&s;enting
nobler and more intere&s;ting objects, they amply com|pen&s;ate
for that tranquillity, of which they bereave the

mu&s;es. The &s;peeches of the parliamentary orators dur|ing
this period, are of a &s;train much &s;uperior to what
any former age had produced in England; and the force
and compa&s;s of our tongue were then fir&s;t put to trial.
It mu&s;t however be confe&s;&s;ed, that the wretched fanati|ci&s;m,
which &s;o much infected the parliamentary party,
was no le&s;s de&s;tructive of ta&s;te and &s;cience, than of all
law and order. Gaity and wit were pro&s;cribed: Hu|man
learning de&s;pi&s;ed: Freedom of enquiry dete&s;ted:
Cant and hypocri&s;y alone encouraged. It was an ar|ticle
po&s;itively in&s;i&s;ted on in the preliminaries to the
treaty of Uxbrige, that all play-hou&s;es &s;hould for ever
be aboli&s;hed. Sir John Davenant, &s;ays Whitlocke<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">P. 639.</NOTE>,
&s;peaking of the year 1658, publi&s;hed an opera, not|with&s;tanding
the nicety of the times. All the King's
furniture was put to &s;ale: His pictures, di&s;po&s;ed of at
very low prices, enriched all the collections of Europe:
Even his palaces were pulled to pieces, and the materials
of them &s;old. The very library and medals at St.
James's, was intended by the Generals to be brought
to auction, in order to pay the arrears of &s;ome regi|ments
of cavalry, quartered near London: But Selden,
apprehen&s;ive of this lo&s;s, engaged his friend Whitlocke,
then Lord-Keeper for the Commonwealth, to apply for
the office of Librarian. This contrivance &s;aved that
valuable collection.</P>
<P>'TIS however remarkable, that the greate&s;t genius by
far, which &s;hone forth in England during this period,
was deeply engaged with the&s;e fanatics, and even pro|&s;tituted
his pen in theological controver&s;y, in factious
di&s;putes, and in ju&s;tifying the mo&s;t violent mea&s;ures of
the party. This was John Milton, who&s;e poems are ad|mirable,
though liable to &s;ome objections; his pro&s;e
writings di&s;agreeable, though not altogether defective in
genius. Nor are all his poems equal: His Paradi&s;e
<PB N="352" REF="446">
Lo&s;t, his Comus, and a few others, &s;hine out amid&s;t
&s;ome flat and in&s;ipid compo&s;itions: Even in the Paradi&s;e
Lo&s;t, his capital performance, there are very long pa&s;|&s;ages,
amounting to near a third of the work, almo&s;t
wholly devoid of harmony and elegance, nay, of all vi|gour
of imagination. The natural inequality in Mil|ton's
genius was much increa&s;ed by the inequalities in
his &s;ubject; of which &s;ome parts are of them&s;elves the
mo&s;t lofty that can enter into human conception,
others would have required the mo&s;t laboured elegance
of compo&s;ition to &s;upport them. It is certain, that this
author, when in a happy mood, and employed on a
noble &s;ubject, is the mo&s;t wonderfully &s;ublime of any
poet in any language; Homer and Lucretius and Ta&s;&s;o
not excepted. More conci&s;e than Homer, more &s;imple
than Ta&s;&s;o, more nervous than Lucretius; had he lived
in a latter age, and learned to poli&s;h &s;ome ruden$&s;s in
his ver&s;es; had he enjoyed better fortune, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
lei&s;ure to watch the returns of genius in him&s;elf; he
had attained the pinnacle of human perfection, and
borne away the palm of $pic poetry.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that Milton never enjoyed in his
life-time the reputation which he de&s;erved. His Para|di&s;e
Lo&s;t was long neglected: Prejudices again&s;t an
apologi&s;t for the regicides, and again&s;t a work not
wholly purged of the cant of former times, kept the
ignorant world from perceiving the prodigious merit of
that performance. Lord Somers, by encouraging a
good edition of it, about twenty years after the author's
death, fir&s;t brought it into reputation; and Ton&s;on, in
his dedication of a &s;maller edition, &s;peaks of it as a
work ju&s;t beginning to be known. Even during the
prevalence of Milton's party, he &s;eems never to have
been much regarded; and Whitlocke<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">P. 633.</NOTE> talks of one
Milton, as he calls him, a blind man, who was em|ployed
<PB N="353" REF="447">
in tran&s;lating a treaty with Sweden into Latin.
The&s;e forms of expre&s;&s;ion are amu&s;ing to po&s;terity, who
con&s;ider how ob&s;cure Whitlocke him&s;elf, though Lord-Keeper
and Amba&s;&s;ador, and indeed a man of great abi|lity
and merit, has become in compari&s;on of Milton.</P>
<P>IT was not &s;trange, that Milton received no encou|ragement
after the re&s;toration: It was more to be admir|ed,
that he e&s;caped with his life. Many of the cavaliers
blamed extremely that lenity towards him, which was
&s;o honourable in the King, and &s;o advantageous to
po&s;terity. It is &s;aid, that he had &s;aved Davenant's life
during the Protector&s;hip; and Davenant in return af|fored
him like protection after the re&s;toration; being
&s;en&s;ible, that men of letters ought always to regard their
&s;ympathy of ta&s;te as a more powerful band of union,
than any difference of party or opinion as a &s;ource of
animo&s;ity. It was during a &s;tate of poverty, blindne&s;s,
di&s;grace, danger, and old age, that Milton compo&s;ed
his wonderful poem, which not only &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all the
performances of his cotemporaries, but all the compo|&s;itions,
which had flowed from his pen, during the vi|gor
of his age, and the height of his pro&s;perity. This
circum&s;tance is not the lea&s;t remarkable of all tho&s;e
which attend that great genius.</P>
<P>WALLER was the fir&s;t refiner of Engli&s;h poetry, at
lea&s;t of Engli&s;h rhyme; but his performances &s;till
abound with many faults, and what is more material,
they contain but feeble and &s;uperficial beauties. Gaiety,
wit, and ingenuity are their ruling character: They
a&s;pire not to the &s;ublime; &s;till le&s;s to the pathetic.
They treat of love, without making us feel any ten|derne&s;s;
and abound in panegyric, without exciting
admiration. The panegyric however on Cromwel,
contains more force than we &s;hould expect from the
other compo&s;itions of this poet.</P>
<P><PB N="354" REF="448">
WALLER was born to an ample fortune, was early in|troduced
to the court, and lived in the be&s;t company.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed talents for eloquence as well as poetry;
and till his death, which happened in a good old age,
he was the delight of the hou&s;e of commons. The er|rors
of his life proceeded more from want of courage
than of honour or integrity.</P>
<P>COWLEY is an author extremely corrupted by the
bad ta&s;te of his age; but had he lived even in the
pure&s;t times of Greece and Rome, he mu&s;t always have
been a very indifferent poet. He had no ear for har|mony;
and his ver&s;es are only known to be &s;uch by the
rhyme, which terminates them. In his rugged untune|able
numbers are conveyed &s;entiments the mo&s;t &s;trained
and violent; long &s;pun allegories, di&s;tant allu&s;ions, and
forced conceits. Great ingenuity, however, and force
of thought &s;ometimes break out amid&s;t tho&s;e unnatural
conceptions: A few anacreontics &s;urpri&s;e us by their
ea&s;e and gaiety: His pro&s;e writings plea&s;e, by the ho|ne&s;ty
and goodne&s;s which they expre&s;s; and even by
their &s;pleen and melancholy. This author was much
more prai&s;ed and admired during his life time, and cele|brated
after his death, than the great Milton.</P>
<P>SIR JOHN DENHAM in his Cooper's Hill (for none
of his other poems merit attention) has a loftine&s;s and
vigor, which had not before him been attained by any
Engli&s;h poet, who wrote in rhyme. The mechanical
difficulties of that mea&s;ure retarded its improvement.
Shake&s;peare, who&s;e tragic &s;cenes are &s;o wonderfully
forcible and expre&s;&s;ive, is a very indifferent poet, when
he attempts rhyme. Preci&s;ion and neatne&s;s are chiefly
wanting in Denham.</P>
<P>NO author in that age was more c$lebrated both abroad
and at home than Hobbes: In our times, he is much
neglected: A lively in&s;tance, how pr$carious all repu|tations,
<PB N="355" REF="449">
founded on rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy! A plea|&s;ant
comedy, which paints the manners of the age,
and expo&s;es a faithful picture of nature, is a durable
work, and is tran&s;mitted to the late&s;t po&s;terity. But a
&s;y&s;tem, whether phy&s;ical or metaphy&s;ical, owes com|monly
its &s;ucce&s;s to its novelty; and is no &s;ooner can|va&s;&s;ed
with impartiality than its weakne&s;s is di&s;covered.
Hobbes's politics are fitted only to promote tyranny,
and his ethics to encourage licentiou&s;ne&s;s. Though an
enemy to religion, he partakes nothing of the &s;pirit of
&s;ceptici&s;m; but is as po&s;itive and dogmatical as if human
rea&s;on, and his rea&s;on in particular, could attain a
thorough conviction on the&s;e &s;ubjects. Clearne&s;s and
propriety of &s;tyle are the chief excellencies of Hobbes's
writings. In his own per&s;on he is repre&s;ented to have
been a man of virtue; a character no wi&s;e &s;urpri&s;ing,
notwith&s;tanding his libertine &s;y&s;tem of ethics. Timi|dity
is the principal fault with which he is reproached:
He lived to an extreme old age, yet could never recon|cile
him&s;elf to the thoughts of death. The boldne&s;s of
his opinions and &s;entiments, form a remarkable con|tra&s;t
to this part of his character.</P>
<P>HARRINGTON's Ocena was well adapted to that age,
when the plans of imaginary republics were the daily
&s;ubjects of debate and conver&s;ation; and even in our
time it is ju&s;tly admired as a work of genius and inven|tion.
The idea however of a perfect and immortal
Commonwealth will always be found as chimerical as
that of a perfect and immortal man. The &s;tyle of this
author wants ea&s;e and fluency; but the good matter,
which his work contains, makes ample compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>HARVEY is intitled to the glory of having made, by
rea&s;oning alone, without any mixture of accident, a
capital di&s;covery in one of the mo&s;t important branches
of &s;cience. He had al&s;o the happine&s;s of e&s;tabli&s;hing at
once his theory on the mo&s;t &s;olid and convincing proofs;
<PB N="356" REF="450">
and po&s;terity has added little to the arguments &s;ugge&s;ted
by his indu&s;try and ingenuity. His treati&s;e of the cir|culation
of the blood is farther embelli&s;hed by that
warmth and &s;pirit, which &s;o naturally accompany the
genius of invention. This great man was much fa|voured
by Charles the fir&s;t, who gave him the liberty
of u&s;ing all the deer in the royal fore&s;ts for perfecting
his di&s;coverics on the generation of animals.</P>
<P>THIS age affords great materials for hi&s;tory; but did
not produce any accompli&s;hed hi&s;torian. Clarendon,
however, will always be e&s;teemed an entertaining author,
even independant of our curio&s;ity to know the facts,
which he relates. His &s;tyle is prolix and redundant,
and &s;uffocates us by the length of its periods: But it
di&s;covers imagination and &s;entiment, and plea&s;es us at
the &s;ame time that we di&s;approve of it. He is more partial
in appearance than in reality: For he &s;eems perpetually
anxious to apologize for the King; but his apologies
are often well grounded. He is le&s;s partial in his rela|tion
of facts, than in his account of characters: He
was too hone&s;t a man to fal&s;ify the former; his affec|tions
were ea&s;ily capable, unknown to him&s;elf, of di&s;|gui&s;ing
the latter. An air of probity and goodne&s;s runs
through the whole work; as the&s;e qualities did in reality
embelli&s;h the whole life of the author.</P>
<P>THESE are the chief performances, which engage
the attention of po&s;terity. Tho&s;e numberle&s;s produc|tions,
with which the pre&s;s then abounded; the cant
of the pulpit, the declamations of party, the &s;ubtilties
of theology; all the&s;e have long ago &s;unk into &s;ilence
and oblivion. Even a writer, &s;uch as Selden, who&s;e
learning was his chief excellency; or Chillingworth,
an accute di&s;putant again&s;t the papi&s;ts, will &s;carce ever
be ranked among the cla&s;&s;ics of our language or coun|try.</P>

<P>CHARLES the &s;econd,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIII.</NOTE> when he a&s;cended the
throne of his ance&s;tors, was thirty years of age.
He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a vigorous con&s;titution, a fine &s;hape, a
manly figure, a graceful air; and though his features
were har&s;h, yet was his countenance in the main lively
and engaging. He was in that period of life, when
there remains enough of youth to render the per&s;on ami|able,
without dimini&s;hing that authority and regard,
which attend the years of experience and maturity.
Tenderne&s;s was excited by the memory of his recent
adver&s;ities. His pre&s;ent pro&s;perity was the object rather
of admiration than of envy. And as the &s;udden and
<PB N="358" REF="452">
&s;urpri&s;ing revolution, which re&s;tored him to his regal
rights, had al&s;o re&s;tored the nation to peace, law, or|der,
and liberty; no prince ever obtained a crown in
more favourable circum&s;tances, or was more ble&s;t with
the cordial affection and attachment of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>THIS popularity, the King, by his whole demeanor
and behaviour, was well qualified to &s;upport and to in|crea&s;e.
To a lively wit and quick comprehen&s;ion, he
united a ju&s;t under&s;tanding and a general ob&s;ervation
both of men and things. The ea&s;ie&s;t manners, the
mo&s;t unaffected politene&s;s, the mo&s;t engaging gaiety ac|companied
his conver&s;ation and addre&s;s. Accu&s;tomed
during his exile to live among his courtiers rather like a
companion than a monarch, he retained, even while on
the throne, that open affability, which was capable of
reconciling the mo&s;t determined republicans to his royal
dignity. Totally devoid of re&s;entment, as well from
the natural lenity as carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of his temper, he in|&s;ured
pardon to the mo&s;t guilty of his enemies, and left
hopes of favour to his mo&s;t violent opponents. From
the whole tenor of his actions and di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;eemed
de&s;irous of lo&s;ing the memory of pa&s;t animo&s;ities, and
of uniting every party in an affection for their prince
and their country.</P>
<P>INTO his council were admitted the mo&s;t eminent<NOTE PLACE="marg">New mini|&s;try.</NOTE>
men of the nation, without regard to former di&s;tinc|tions:
The pre&s;byterians, equally with the royali&s;ts,
&s;hared this honour. Anne&s;ley was al&s;o created Earl of
Angle&s;ey; A&s;hley Cooper Lord A&s;hley; Denzil Hollis
Lord Hollis. The Earl of Manche&s;ter was appointed
Lord Chamberlain, and Lord Say Privy Seal. Calamy
and Baxter, pre&s;byterian clergymen, were even made
Chaplains to the King.</P>
<P>ADMIRAL MONTAGUE, created Earl of Sandwich,
was entitled from his recent &s;ervices to great favour;
<PB N="359" REF="453">
and he obtained it. Monk, created Duke of Albe|marle,
had performed &s;uch &s;ignal &s;ervices, that, accord|ing
to a vulgar and malignant ob&s;ervation, he ought
rather to have expected hatred and ingratitude: Yet
was he ever treated by the King with great marks of
di&s;tinction. Charles's di&s;po&s;ition, free from jealou&s;y;
and the prudent behaviour of the General, who never
over-rated his merits; prevented all tho&s;e di&s;gu&s;ts,
which naturally ari&s;e in &s;o delicate a &s;ituation. The
capacity too of Albemarle was not exten&s;ive, nor
were his parts &s;hining. Though he had di&s;tingui&s;hed
him&s;elf in inferior &s;tations, he was found, upon fami|liar
acquaintance, to be unequal to tho&s;e great at|chievements,
which fortune had enabled him to per|form;
and he appeared unfit for the court, a &s;cene of
life to which he had never been accu&s;tomed. Morrice,
his friend, was created Secretary of State, and was &s;up|ported
more by his patron's credit than by his own abi|lity
or experience.</P>
<P>BUT the choice, which the King at fir&s;t made of his
principal mini&s;ters and favourites, was the circum|&s;tance,
which chiefly gave contentment to the nation,
and progno&s;ticated future happine&s;s and tranquillity.
Sir Edward Hyde, created Earl of Clarendon, was
Chancellor and Prime Mini&s;ter: The Marque&s;s, created
Duke, of Ormond, was Lord Steward of the Hou&s;e|hold:
The Earl of Southampton, High Trea&s;urer:
Sir Edward Nicholas, Secretary of State. The&s;e men,
united together in the &s;tricte&s;t friend&s;hip, and combin|ing
in the &s;ame laudable inclinations, &s;upported each
others credit, and pur&s;ued the intere&s;t of the public.</P>
<P>AGREEABLE to the pre&s;ent pro&s;perity of public affairs
was the univer&s;al joy and fe&s;tivity diffu&s;ed throughout
the nation. The melancholy au&s;terity of the fanatics
fell into di&s;credit together with their principles. The
royali&s;ts, who had ever affected a contrary di&s;po&s;ition,
<PB N="360" REF="454">
found in their recent &s;ucce&s;s new motives for mirth
and gaiety; and it now belonged to them to give re|pute
and fa&s;hion to their manners. From pa&s;t expe|rience
it had &s;ufficiently appeared, that gravity was very
di&s;tinct from wi&s;dom, formality from virtue, and hypo|cri&s;y
from religion. The King him&s;elf, who bore a
&s;trong propen&s;ity to plea&s;ure and &s;ociety, &s;erved, by his
powerful and engaging example, to bani&s;h tho&s;e &s;our
and malignant humours, which had hitherto engendered
&s;uch confu&s;ion. And though the ju&s;t bounds were un|doubtedly
pa&s;&s;ed, when men return from their former
extreme; yet was the public happy in exchanging
vices pernicious to &s;ociety for di&s;orders hurtful chiefly
to the individuals them&s;elves, who were guilty of
them.</P>
<P>IT required &s;ome time before the &s;everal parts of the
&s;tate, disfigured by war and faction, could recover their
former arrangement: But the parliament immediately
entered into a good corre&s;pondence with the King, and
they treated him with the &s;ame dutiful regard, which
had u&s;ually been payed to his predece&s;&s;ors. Being &s;um|moned
without the King's con&s;ent, they received, at
fir&s;t, only the title of a convention; and it was not
till the King pa&s;&s;ed an act for that purpo&s;e, that they
were called by the appellation of parliament. All judi|cial
proceedings, tran&s;acted in the name of the Com|monwealth
or Protector, they thought it requi&s;ite to ra|tify
by a new law. And both hou&s;es acknowledging
the guilt of the former rebellion, in their own name and
in that of all the &s;ubjects, laid hold of his Maje&s;ty's gra|cious
pardon and indemnity.</P>
<P>THE King, before his re&s;toration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of in|demity.</NOTE> being afraid of re|ducing
any of his enemies to de&s;pair, and at the &s;ame
time unwilling that &s;uch enormous crimes as had been
committed, &s;hould receive a total impunity, had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf very cautiou&s;ly in his declaration of
<PB N="361" REF="455">
Breda, and had promi&s;ed an indemnity to all criminals,
but &s;uch as &s;hould be excepted by the parliament. He
now i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, declaring that &s;uch of the
late King's judges as did not yield them&s;elves pri&s;oners
within fourteen days &s;hould receive no pardon. Nine|teen
&s;urrendered them&s;elves: Some were taken in their
flight: Others e&s;caped beyond &s;ea.</P>
<P>THE Commons &s;eem to have been more inclined to
lenity than the Lords. The upper hou&s;e, inflamed with
the ill u&s;age, which they had received, were re&s;olved,
be&s;ides the late King's judges, to except every one, who
had &s;at in any high court of ju&s;tice. Nay, the Earl of
Bri&s;tol moved, that no pardon might be granted to tho&s;e
who had any way contributed to the King's death. So
wide an exception, in which every one, who had &s;erved
the parliament, might be comprehended, gave a general
alarm; and men began to apprehend, that this motion
was the effect of &s;ome court artifice or intrigue. But
the King &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated the&s;e fears. He came to the
hou&s;e of Peers; and in the mo&s;t earne&s;t terms, pre&s;&s;ed
the act of general indemnity. He urged both the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of the thing, and the obligation of his former
promi&s;e: A promi&s;e, he &s;aid, which he would ever re|gard
as &s;acred; &s;ince to it he probably owed the &s;atisfac|tion,
which at pre&s;ent he enjoyed, of meeting his peo|ple
in parliament. This mea&s;ure of the King, though
irregular, by his taking notice of a bill which depended
before the hou&s;es, was received with great applau&s;e and
&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>AFTER repeated &s;ollicitations from the King, the act
of indemnity pa&s;&s;ed both hou&s;es, and &s;oon received
the royal a&s;&s;ent. Tho&s;e who had an immediate hand
in the King's death, were there excepted: Even Crom|wel,
Ireton, Brad&s;haw, and others now dead were at|tainted,
and their e&s;tates for&s;eited. Vane and Lambert,
tho' none of the King's judges, were al&s;o excepted. St.
<PB N="362" REF="456">
John and &s;eventeen per&s;ons more were deprived of all
benefit from this act, if they ever accepted any public
employment. All who had &s;at in any illegal high
court of ju&s;tice were di&s;abled from bearing offices.
The&s;e were all the &s;everities, which followed &s;uch furi|ous
civil wars and convul&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE next bu&s;ine&s;s was the &s;ettlement of the King's
revenue.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the re|venue.</NOTE> In this work, the parliament had regard to
public freedom as well as to the &s;upport of the crown.
The tenures of wards and liverics had long been re|garded
as a grievance by all lovers of liberty: Several
attempts had been made during the reign of James to
purcha&s;e this prerogative together with that of purvey|ance;
and 200,000 pounds a year had been offered
that Prince in lieu of them. During the time of the
republic, ward&s;hips and purveyance had been utterly
aboli&s;hed. And even in the pre&s;ent parliament, before
the King arrived in England, a bill had been introdu|ced,
offering him a compen&s;ation for the&s;e revenues. A
hundred thou&s;and pounds a year was the &s;um, which
the parliament agreed to; and half of the exci&s;e was
&s;ettled in perpetuity upon the crown as the fund whence
that revenue &s;hould be levied. Though that impo&s;t
yielded more profit, the bargain might be e&s;teemed hard;
and it was chiefly the nece&s;&s;ity of the King's &s;ituation,
which induced him to con&s;ent to it. No reque&s;t of the
parliament, during the pre&s;ent joy, could be refu&s;ed
them.</P>
<P>NOT only the power of the crown, by means of
ward&s;hips and purveyance, was very con&s;iderable: It
was al&s;o unequal and per&s;onal; and con&s;equently, of a
nature un&s;uitable to a monarchy, &s;ubjected to &s;trict and
regular limitations. The uniformity, therefore, of the
political &s;y&s;tem &s;eemed to require the abolition of the&s;e
Gothic in&s;titutions; though it might perhaps appear
<PB N="363" REF="457">
unju&s;t, that an advantage, which chiefly re&s;ulted to the
proprietors of land, &s;hould be purcha&s;ed by an impo&s;t,
that affected every inhabitant of the kingdom.</P>
<P>TONNAGE and poundage and the other half of the
exci&s;e were granted to the King during life. The par|liament
even proceeded &s;o far as to vote that the &s;ettled
revenue of the crown for all charges &s;hould be 1200,000
pounds a year; a &s;um larger than any Engli&s;h monarch
had ever before enjoyed. The late King's revenue
from 1637 to the meeting of the long parliament ap|peared
to be at a medium near 900,000 pounds a year;
of which 200,000 pounds aro&s;e from branches, partly
illegal, partly expired. The misfortunes of that Prince
were now believed to have proceeded originally from the
narrowne&s;s of his revenue, and from the ob&s;tinacy of
his parliaments, who had refu&s;ed him the nece&s;&s;ary
&s;upply. And as all the monarchs of Europe were per|petually
augmenting their forces, and con&s;equently
their expences, it became requi&s;ite that England, from
motives both of honour and &s;ecurity, &s;hould bear &s;ome
proportion to them, and adapt its revenue to the new
&s;y&s;tem of politics, which prevailed. According to the
Chancellor's computation, a charge of 800,000 pounds
a year, was at pre&s;ent required for the fleet and other
articles, which formerly co&s;t the crown but eighty thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>HAD the parliament, before re&s;toring the King, in|&s;i&s;ted
on any farther limitations than tho&s;e which the
con&s;titution already impo&s;ed; be&s;ides the danger of in|flaming
the antient quarrels among parties; it would
&s;eem, that their caution had been entirely &s;uperfluous.
By rea&s;on of its &s;lender and precarious revenue, the
crown in effect was &s;till totally dependant. Not a
fourth part of this &s;um, which &s;eemed requi&s;ite for pub|lic
expences, could be levied without con&s;ent of parlia|ment;
and any conce&s;&s;ions, had they been thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="364" REF="458">
might, even after the re&s;toration, be extorted
by the Commons from their nece&s;&s;itous Prince. This
parliament &s;howed no intention of employing at pre&s;ent
that engine to any &s;uch purpo&s;es; but they &s;eemed &s;till
determined not to part with it entirely, or to render the
revenues of the crown fixed and independant. Though
they voted in general, that 1200,000 pounds a year
&s;hould be &s;ettled on the King, they a&s;&s;igned not any
funds, which could yield two thirds of that &s;um. And
they left the care of fulfilling their engagements to the
future con&s;ideration of parliament.</P>
<P>IN all the temporary &s;upplies, which they voted, they
di&s;covered the &s;ame cautious frugality. To di&s;band the
army, &s;o formidable in it&s;elf, and &s;o much accu&s;tomed
to rebellion and changes of government, was nece&s;&s;ary
for the &s;ecurity both of King and parliament; yet the
Commons &s;howed great jealou&s;y in granting the &s;ums,
requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e. An a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of 70,000
pounds a month was impo&s;ed: but it was at fir&s;t voted,
to continue only for three months: And all the other
&s;ums, which, by a poll-bill and new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, they
levied for that u&s;e, they &s;till granted by parcels; as if
they were not, as yet, well a&s;&s;ured of the fidelity of
that hand, to which the money was committed. Hav|ing
proceeded &s;o far in the &s;ettlement of the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Sep|tember.</NOTE> the
parliament adjourned them&s;elves for &s;ome time.</P>
<P>DURING the rece&s;s of parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the regicides.</NOTE> the object, which
chiefly intere&s;ted the public, was the trial and condem|nation
of the regicides. The general indignation,
which attended the enormous crime, of which the&s;e men
had been guilty, made their &s;ufferings the &s;ubject of
joy to the people: But in the peculiar circum&s;tances of
that action, in the prejudices of the times, as well as
in the behaviour of the criminals, a mind, &s;ea&s;oned
with humanity, will find a plentiful &s;ource of compa&s;|&s;ion
and indulgence. Can any one, without the ut|mo&s;t
<PB N="365" REF="459">
concern for human blindne&s;s and ignorance, con|&s;ider
the demeanor of General Harri&s;on, who was fir&s;t
brought to his trial? With great courage and elevation
of &s;entiment, he told the court, that the pretended
crime, of which he &s;tood accu&s;ed, was not a deed, per|formed
in a corner: The found of it had gone forth to
mo&s;t nations; and in the &s;ingular and marvellous con|duct
of it had chiefly appeared the &s;overeign power
of heaven. That he him&s;elf, agitated by doubts, had
often, with pa&s;&s;ionate tears, offered his addre&s;&s;es to the
divine maje&s;ty; and carne&s;tly &s;ought for light and con|viction:
He had &s;till received a&s;&s;urance of a heavenly
&s;anction, and returned from the&s;e devout &s;upplications
with more &s;erene tranquillity and &s;atisfaction. That all
the nations of the earth, in the eyes of their creator,
were le&s;s than a drop of water in the bucket; nor were
their erroneous judgments aught but darkne&s;s compared
with divine illuminations. That the&s;e frequent illap&s;es
of the divine &s;pirit he could not &s;u&s;pect to be intere&s;ted
illu&s;ions; &s;ince he was con&s;cious, that, for no tempo|ral
advantage, would he offer injury to the poore&s;t man
or woman who trod upon the earth. That all the al|lurements
of ambition, all the terrors of impri&s;onment,
had not been able, during the u&s;urpation of Cromwel,
to &s;hake his &s;teddy re&s;olution or bend him to a compli|ance
with that deceitful tyrant. And that when invited
by him to &s;it on the right hand of the throne, when
offered riches and &s;plendor and dominion, he had dis|dainfully
rejected all temptations; and neglecting the
tears of his friends and family, had &s;till, through every
danger, held fa&s;t his principles and his integrity.</P>
<P>SCOT, who was more a republican than a fanatic,
had &s;aid in the hou&s;e of Commons, a little before the
re&s;toration, that he de&s;ired no other epitaph to be in|&s;cribed
on his tomb-&s;tone than this; <HI>Here lies Thomas
<PB N="366" REF="460">
Scot, who adjudged the King to death.</HI> He &s;upported the
&s;ame &s;pirit upon his trial.</P>
<P>CAREW, a Millenarian, &s;ubmitted to his trial, <HI>&s;aving
to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t his right to the government of the&s;e
kingdoms.</HI> Some &s;crupled to &s;ay, according to form,
that they would be tried by God and their country; be|cau&s;e
God was not vi&s;ibly pre&s;ent to judge them.
Others &s;aid, that they would be tried by the word of
God.</P>
<P>NO more than &s;ix of the late King's judges, Harri|&s;on,
Scot, Carew, Clement, Jones, and Scrope, were
executed: Scrope alone, of all tho&s;e who came in upon
the King's proclamation. He was a gentleman of a
good family and of a decent character: But it was
proved, that he had lately, in conver&s;ation, expre&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf as if he were no wi&s;e convinced of his guilt in
condemning the King. Axtel, who had guarded the
high court of ju&s;tice, Hacker, who commanded on the
day of the King's execution, Coke, the &s;ollicitor for
the people of England, and Hugh Peters, the furious
preacher, who inflamed the army to regicide: All the&s;e
were tried, and condemned, and &s;uffered with the
King's judges. No &s;aint nor confe&s;&s;or ever went to
martyrdom with more a&s;&s;ured confidence of heaven than
was expre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e criminals, even when the terrors
of immediate death, joined to many indignities, were
&s;et before them. The re&s;t of the King's judges, by an
unexampled lenity, were reprieved; and they were di&s;|per&s;ed
into &s;everal pri&s;ons.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Sep|tember.</NOTE> THIS puni&s;hment of declared enemies no wi&s;e inter|rupted
the rejoicings of the court: But the death of
the Duke of Gloce&s;ter, a young Prince of very pro|mi&s;ing
hopes, threw a great cloud upon them. The
King, by no incident in his life, was ever &s;o deeply
<PB N="367" REF="461">
affected. Gloce&s;ter was ob&s;erved to po&s;&s;e&s;s united the
good qualities of both his brothers: The clear judgment
and penetration of the King; the indu&s;try and applica|tion
of the Duke of York. He was al&s;o believed to be
affectionate to the religion and con&s;titution of his coun|try.
He was but twenty years of age, when the &s;mall
pox put an end to his life.</P>
<P>THE Prince&s;s of Orange, having come to England,
in order to partake of the joy, attending the re&s;tora|tion
of her family, with whom &s;he lived in great
friend&s;hip, &s;oon after &s;ickned and died. The Queen-mother
payed a vi&s;it to her &s;on; and obtained his con|&s;ent
to the marriage of the Prince&s;s Henrietta, with the
Duke of Orleans, brother to the French King.</P>
<P>AFTER a rece&s;s of near two months, the parliament
met,<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of No|vember.</NOTE> and proceeded in the great work of the national
&s;ettlement. They e&s;tabli&s;hed the po&s;t-office, wine|licences,
and &s;ome articles of the revenue. They
granted more a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments, and &s;ome arrears for paying
and di&s;banding the army. Bu&s;ine&s;s, being carried on
with great unanimity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;&s;olution of the Con|vention Par|liament. 29th of De|cember.</NOTE> was &s;oon di&s;patched: And after
they had &s;at near two months, the King in a &s;peech
full of the mo&s;t gracious expre&s;&s;ions, thought proper to
di&s;&s;olve them.</P>
<P>THIS Hou&s;e of Commons had been cho&s;en during the
reign of the old parliamentary party; and though many
royali&s;ts had crept in among&s;t them, yet did it chiefly
con&s;i&s;t of pre&s;byterians, who had not yet entirely laid
a&s;ide their old jealou&s;ies and principles, Lenthal, a
member, having &s;aid, that tho&s;e who fir&s;t took arms
again&s;t the King, were as guilty as tho&s;e, who after|wards
brought him to the &s;caffold, was &s;everely repri|manded
by order of the hou&s;e; and the mo&s;t violent
efforts of the Long Parliament to &s;ecure the con&s;titution,
and bring delinquents to ju&s;tice, were in effect vindicated
<PB N="368" REF="462">
and applauded. The claim of the two hou&s;es to the
militia, the fir&s;t ground of the quarrel, however exor|bitant
an u&s;urpation, this parliament was never brought
expre&s;sly to re&s;ign. All grants of money they made
with a very &s;paring hand. Great arrears being due by
the late Protector, to the fleet, the army, the navy-office,
and every branch of &s;ervice; this whole debt they
threw upon the crown, without e&s;tabli&s;hing funds &s;uffi|cient
for its payment. Yet notwith&s;tanding this jea|lous
care expre&s;&s;ed by the parliament, there prevails a
&s;tory, that Popham, having &s;ounded the di&s;po&s;ition of
the members, undertook to the Earl of Southampton to
procure, during the King's life, a grant of two millions
a year, land tax; a &s;um, which, joined to the cu&s;toms
and exci&s;e, would for ever have rendered this Prince
independant of his people. Southampton, it is &s;aid,
merely from his affection to the King, had unwarily
embraced the offer; and it was not till he communi|cated
the matter to the Chancellor, that he was made
&s;en&s;ible of its pernicious tendency. It is not impro|bable,
that &s;uch an offer might have been made, and
been hearkened to; but it is no wi&s;e probable, that all
the intere&s;t of the court would ever, with this Hou&s;e of
Commons, have been able to make it effectual. Claren|don
&s;howed his prudence, no le&s;s than his integrity,
in entirely rejecting it.</P>
<P>THE Chancellor, from the &s;ame principles of conduct,
ha&s;tened to di&s;band the army. When the King re|viewed
the&s;e veteran troops, he was &s;truck with their
beauty, order, di&s;cipline, and martial appearance; and
being &s;en&s;ible, that regular forces are mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary
implements of royalty, he expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of finding
expedients &s;till to retain them. But his wi&s;e mini&s;ter
&s;et before him the dangerous &s;pirit by which the&s;e troops
were animated, their enthu&s;ia&s;tic genius, their habits of
rebellion and mutiny; and he convinced the King,
<PB N="369" REF="463">
that till they were di&s;banded, he never could e&s;teem
him&s;elf &s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;hed on his throne. No more
troops were retained than a few guards and garri&s;ons,
about 1000 hor&s;e, and 4000 foot. This was the fir&s;t
appearance, under the monarchy, of a regular &s;tanding
army in England. The forti$ications of Gloce&s;ter,
Taunton, and other towns, which had made re&s;i&s;tance
to the King during the civil wars, were al&s;o demoli&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>CLARENDON not only behaved with great wi&s;dom
and ju&s;tice in the office of Chancellor: All the coun|cils,
which he gave the King, tended equally to pro|mote
the intere&s;t of Prince and people. Charles, ac|cu&s;tomed
in his exile to pay entire deference to the
judgement of that faithful &s;ervant, continued &s;till to
&s;ubmit to his direction; and for &s;ome time no mini&s;ter
was ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more ab&s;olute authority. He mo|derated
the forward zeal of the royali&s;ts, and tempered
their appetite for revenge. With the oppo&s;ite party, he
endeavoured to pre&s;erve inviolate all the King's engage|ments:
He kept an exact regi&s;ter of every promi&s;e
which had been made for any &s;ervices, and he employed
all his indu&s;try to fulfil them. This good mini&s;ter was now
very nearly allied to the royal family. His daughter,
Anne Hyde, a woman of &s;pirit and $ine accompli&s;h|ments,
had hearkened, while abroad, to the addre&s;&s;es of
the Duke of York, and under promi&s;e of marriage, had
&s;ecretly admitted him to her bed. Her pregnancy &s;oon
appeared after the re&s;toration; and though many en|deavoured
to di&s;&s;uade the Duke from &s;o unequal an al|liance,
the King, in pity to his friend and mini&s;ter,
who had been totally ignorant of the&s;e engagements,
obliged his brother to marry her. Clarendon expre&s;&s;ed
great unea&s;ine&s;s, at the honour, which he had obtained;
and &s;aid, that, by being elevated &s;o much above his
rank, he thence dreaded a more &s;udden downfal.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="464">
MOST circum&s;tances of Clarendon's admini&s;tration
have met with applau&s;e: His maxims alone in the
conduct of eccle&s;ia&s;tical politics have by many been
deemed the effect of prejudices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prelacy re|&s;tored.</NOTE> narrow and bigotted.
Had the jealou&s;y of royal power prevailed &s;o far with
the Convention Parliament as to make them re&s;tore the
King upon &s;trict limitations, there is no que&s;tion but
the e&s;tabli&s;hment of pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline had been one
of the conditions mo&s;t rigidly in&s;i&s;ted on. Not only
that form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government is more favour|able
to liberty than to royal power: It was likewi&s;e on
its own account, agreeable to the majority of the Hou&s;e
of Commons, and &s;uited their religious principles. But
as the impatience of the people, the danger of delay,
the general di&s;gu&s;t towards faction, and the authority of
Monk had prevailed over that jealous project of limita|tions,
the full &s;ettlement of the hierarchy, together with
the monarchy, was a nece&s;&s;ary and infallible con&s;e|quence.
All the royali&s;ts were zealous for that mode
of religion; the merits of the epi&s;copal clergy towards
the King, as well as their &s;ufferings on that account,
had been very great; the laws, which e&s;tabli&s;hed bi|&s;hops
and the liturgy, were as yet unrepealed by legal
authority; and any attempt of the parliament, by new
acts, to give the &s;uperiority to pre&s;byteriani&s;m, had
been &s;ufficient to involve again the nation in blood and
confu&s;ion. Moved by the&s;e views, the Commons had
very wi&s;ely po&s;tponed the examination of all religious
controver&s;y, and had le$t entirely the &s;ettlement of the
church to the King and to the antient laws.</P>
<P>THE King at fir&s;t u&s;ed great moderation in the exe|cution
of the laws. Nine bi&s;hops &s;till remained alive;
and the&s;e were immediately re&s;tored to their dioce&s;es:
All the ejected clergy recovered their livings: The li|turgy,
a form of wor&s;hip very decent, and not without
beauty, was again admitted into the churches: But at
<PB N="371" REF="465">
the &s;ame time, a declaration was i&s;&s;ued, in order to give
contentment to the pre&s;byterians, and pre&s;erve an air of
moderation and neutrality. In that declaration, the
King promi&s;ed, that he would provide &s;uffragan bi&s;hops
for the larger dioce&s;es; that the prelates &s;hould, all of
them, be regular and con&s;tant preachers; that they
&s;hould not confer ordination, or exerci&s;e any juri&s;dic|tion,
without the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pre&s;byters,
cho&s;en by the dioce&s;e; that &s;uch alterations &s;hould be
made in the liturgy, as would render it totally unexcep|tionable;
that in the mean time, the u&s;e of that mode
of wor&s;hip &s;hould not be impo&s;ed on &s;uch as were un|willing
to receive it; and that the &s;urplice, the cro&s;s in
bapti&s;m, and bowing at the name of Je&s;us &s;hould not
be rigidly in&s;i&s;ted on. This declaration the King i&s;&s;ued
as head of the church; and he plainly a&s;&s;umed, in many
parts of it, a legi&s;lative authority in eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters.
But the Engli&s;h government, though more exactly
defined by late conte&s;ts, was not, as yet, reduced, in
every particular, to the &s;trict limits of law. And if
ever prerogative was ju&s;tifiably employed, it &s;eemed to
be on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; when all parts of the &s;tate
were torne with pa&s;t convul&s;ions, and required the mo|derating
hand of the chief magi&s;trate, to reduce them
to their antient order.</P>
<P>BUT though the&s;e appearances of neutrality were
maintained, and a mitigated epi&s;copacy only &s;eemed to
be in&s;i&s;ted on, it was far from the intention of the mi|ni&s;try
always to pre&s;erve like regard to the pre&s;byterians.
The madne&s;s of the Fifth-Monarchy-men afforded them
a pretence for departing from it. Venner, a de&s;perate
enthu&s;ia&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In&s;urrection of the Mille|narians.</NOTE> who had often con&s;pired again&s;t Cromwel,
having, by his zealous lectures, inflamed his own ima|gination
and that of his followers, i&s;&s;ued forth with
them into the &s;treets of London. They were to the
number of &s;ixty, compleatly armed, believed them&s;elves
<PB N="372" REF="466">
invulnerable and invincible, and firmly expected the
&s;ame fortune, which had attended Gideon and other
heroes of the Old Te&s;tament. Every one at fir&s;t fled
before them. One unhappy man, who, being que&s;tion|ed,
&s;aid, &startq;He was for God and King Charles,&endq; they
in&s;tantly murdered. They went triumphantly from
&s;treet to &s;treet, every where proclaiming King Je&s;us,
who, they &s;aid, was their invi&s;ible leader. At length,
the magi&s;trates, having a&s;&s;embled &s;ome train-bands,
made an attack upon them. They defended them&s;elves
with great order as well as valour; and after killing
many of the a&s;&s;ailants, they made a regular retreat into
Cane-Wood near Hamp&s;tead. Next morning, they
were chaced thence by a detachment of the guards;
but they ventured again to invade the city, which was
not prepared to receive them. After committing great
di&s;order, and traver&s;ing almo&s;t every &s;treet of that im|men&s;e
capital, they &s;hut up them&s;elves in a hou&s;e,
which they were re&s;olute to defend to the la&s;t extremity.
Being &s;urrounded, and the hou&s;e untiled, they were
fired upon from every &s;ide; and they &s;till refu&s;ed quar|ter.
The people ru&s;hed in upon them, and &s;eized the
$word$ who were alive. They were tried, condemned, and
executed; and to the la&s;t they per&s;i&s;ted in affirming,
that, if they were deceived, it was the Lord that had
deceived them.</P>
<P>CLARENDON and the mini&s;try took occa&s;ion from
this in&s;urrection to infer the dangerous &s;pirit of the
pre&s;byterians and of all the &s;ectaries: But the madne&s;s
of the attempt &s;ufficiently proved, that it had been un|dertaken
by no concert, and never could have proved
dangerous. The well known hatred too, which pre|vailed
between the pre&s;byterians and the other &s;ects,
&s;hould have removed the former from all &s;u&s;picion of
any concurrence in the enterprize. But as a pretence
was wanted, be&s;ides their old demerits, for ju&s;tifying

the intended rigours again&s;t them, this rea&s;on, how|ever
&s;light, was very greedily laid hold of.</P>

compliance with the King. It was deliberated in the
Engli&s;h council, whether that nation &s;hould be re&s;tored
to its liberty, or whether the forts, erected by Crom|wel,
&s;hould not &s;till be upheld, in order to curb the
mutinous &s;pirit, by which the Scots in all ages had
been &s;o much governed. Lauderdale, who from the
battle of Worce&s;ter to the re&s;toration, had been detain|ed
a pri&s;oner in the Tower, had con&s;iderable influence
with the King; and he &s;trenuou&s;ly oppo&s;ed this violent
mea&s;ure. He repre&s;ented, that it was the loyalty of the
Scots nation, which had engaged them in oppo&s;ition to
the Engli&s;h rebels; and that to take advantage of the
calamities, into which, on that account, they had
fallen, would be regarded as the highe&s;t inju&s;tice and
ingratitude: That the &s;pirit of that people was now
fully &s;ubdued by the long &s;ervitude, under which the
u&s;urpers had detained them, and would of it&s;elf yield to
any rea&s;onable compliance with their legal &s;overeign,
if, by his means, they recovered their liberty and ind$|pendence:
That the attachment of the Scots towards
their King, whom they regarded as their native Prince,
was naturally much &s;tronger than that of the Engli&s;h;
and would afford him a &s;ure re&s;ource, in ca&s;e of any
rebellion among the latter: That republican principles
had long been, and &s;till were, very prevalent with his
$outhern &s;ubjects, and might again menace the throne
with new tumults and re&s;i&s;tance. That the time would
probably come, when the King, in&s;tead of de&s;iring to
&s;e$ Engli&s;h garri&s;ons in Scotland, would be better
plea&s;ed to have Scots garri&s;ons in England, who, &s;up|ported
by Engli&s;h pay, would be fond to curb the &s;e|ditious
genius of that opulent nation: And that a
<PB N="374" REF="468">
people, &s;uch as the Scots, governed by a few nobility,
would more ea&s;ily be reduced to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under mo|narchy,
than one, like the Engli&s;h, who breathed no|thing
but the &s;pirit of democratical equality.</P>
<P>THESE views induced the King to di&s;band all the
forces in Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1661.</NOTE> and to raze all the forts, which had
been erected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Janu|ary.</NOTE> General Middleton, created Earl of that
name, was &s;ent commi&s;&s;ioner to the parliament, which
was &s;ummoned. A very compliant &s;pirit was there di&s;|covered
in all orders of men. The commi&s;&s;ioner had
even &s;ufficient influence to obtain an act, annulling, at
once, all laws, which had pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince the year 1633;
on pretext of the violence, which, during that time,
had been employed again&s;t the King and his father, in
order to procure their a&s;&s;ent to the&s;e &s;tatutes. This
was a very large, if not an unexampled conce&s;&s;ion:
and, together with many dangerous limitations, over|threw
&s;ome u&s;eful barriers, which had been erected to
the con&s;titution. But the tide was now running
&s;trongly towards monarchy; and the Scots nation
plainly di&s;covered, that their pa&s;t re&s;i&s;tence had pro|ceeded
more from the turbulency of their ari&s;tocracy
and the bigotry of their eccle&s;ia&s;tics, than from any
fixed pa&s;&s;ion towards civil liberty. The Lords of ar|ticles
were re&s;tored, with &s;ome exorbitant branches of
prerogative; and royal authority, fortified with more
plau&s;ible claims and pretences, was, in its full extent,
re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in that kingdom.</P>
<P>THE prelacy likewi&s;e, by the abrogating every &s;ta|tute,
enacted in favour of pre&s;bytery, was thereby ta|citely
re&s;tored; and the King deliberated what u&s;e he
&s;hould make of this conce&s;&s;ion. Lauderdale, who at
bottom was a pa&s;&s;ionate zealot again&s;t epi&s;copacy, en|deavoured
to per&s;wade him, that the Scots, if gratified
in this favourite point of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government,
<PB N="375" REF="469">
would, in every other demand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXIII.</NOTE> be entirely compliant
with the King. Charles, though he had no &s;uch at|tachment
to prelacy as had influenced his father and
grandfather, had &s;uffered &s;uch indignities from the Scots
pre&s;byterians, that he ever after bore them a mo&s;t
hearty aver&s;ion. He &s;aid to Lauderdale, that pre&s;byte|riani&s;m,
he thought, was not a religion for a gentle|man;
and he could not con&s;ent to its farther continu|ance
in Scotland. Middleton too and his other mini|&s;ters
per&s;uaded him, that the nation in general were &s;o
di&s;gu&s;ted with the violence and tyranny of the eccle&s;i|a&s;tics,
that any alteration of church government would
be univer&s;ally grateful. And Clarendon, as well as
Ormond, dreading that the pre&s;byterian &s;ect, if legally
e&s;tabli&s;hed in Scotland, would acquire authority in
England and Ireland, &s;econded the application of the&s;e
mini&s;ters. The re&s;olution was therefore taken to re|&s;tore
prelacy; a mea&s;ure afterwards attended with many
and great inconveniencies: But whether in this re&s;olu|tion
the King did not chu&s;e the le&s;s evil, it is very dif|ficult
to determine. Sharpe, who had been commi&s;&s;ioned
by the pre&s;byterians in Scotland to manage their inte|re&s;t
with the King, was per&s;uaded to abandon that
party; and as a reward for his compliance, was created
Archbi&s;hop of St. Andrew's. The management of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical
affairs was chiefly intru&s;ted to him; and as
he was deemed a traitor and a renegade by his old
friends, he became, on that account, as well as from
the violence of his conduct, extremely obnoxious to
them.</P>
<P>CHARLES had not promi&s;ed to Scotland any &s;uch in|demnity
as by his declaration of Breda he had en&s;ured
to England: And it was deemed more political for him
to hold over men's heads, for &s;ome time, the terror of
puni&s;hment; till they &s;hould have made the requi&s;ite
compliance with the new e&s;tabli&s;hed government. Tho'
<PB N="376" REF="470">
neither the King's temper nor plan of admini&s;tration
led him to &s;everity; &s;ome examples, after &s;uch a bloody
and triumphant rebellion, &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary; and the
Marque&s;s of Argyle and one Guthry, were pitched on
as the victims. Two acts of indemnity, one pa&s;&s;ed by
the late King in 1641, another by the pre&s;ent in 1651,
formed, it was thought, invincible ob&s;tacles to the pu|ni&s;hment
of Argyle; and barred all enquiry into that
part of his conduct, which might ju&s;tly be regarded as
the mo&s;t exceptionable. Nothing remained but to try
him for his compliance with the u&s;urpation; a crime
common to him with the whole nation, and &s;uch a one
as the mo&s;t loyal and affectionate &s;ubject might fre|quently
by violence be obliged to commit. To make
this compliance appear the more voluntary and hearty,
there were produced in court letters which he had
wrote to Albemarle, while that General governed Scot|land,
and which contained expre&s;&s;ions of the mo&s;t cor|dial
attachment. But be&s;ides the general indignation,
excited by Albemarle's di&s;covery of this private corre&s;|pondence;
men thought, that even the highe&s;t demon|&s;trations
of affection might, during jealous times, be ex|acted
as a nece&s;&s;ary mark of compliance from a per&s;on
of &s;uch di&s;tinction as Argyle, and could not, by any
equitable con&s;truction, imply the crime of trea&s;on. The
parliament, however, was reduced to &s;uch a &s;tate of
&s;ervile complai&s;ance as to pa&s;s &s;entence upon him: and
he died with great con&s;tancy and courage. As he was
univer&s;ally known to have been the chief in&s;trument of
pa&s;t di&s;orders and civil wars, the irregularity of his &s;en|tence,
and &s;everal iniquitous circum&s;tances in the me|thod
of conducting his trial, &s;eemed on that account to
admit of &s;ome apology. The Lord Lorne, &s;on to
Argyle, having ever pre&s;erved his loyalty, obtained a
gift of the forfeiture. Guthry was a &s;editious preacher,
and had per&s;onally affronted the King: His puni&s;hment
<PB N="377" REF="471">
gave &s;urprize to no body. Sir Archibald John&s;tone of
Warri&s;ton was attainted and fled; but was &s;eized in
France about two years after, brought over and exe|cuted.
He had been very active, during all the late di&s;|orders;
and was even &s;u&s;pected of a &s;ecret combination
with the Engli&s;h regicides.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e in&s;tances of compliance in the Scots
parliament, they voted an additional revenue to the
King of 40,000 pounds a year, to be levied by way of
exci&s;e. A &s;mall force was propo&s;ed to be maintained by
this revenue, in order to prevent like confu&s;ions with
tho&s;e to which the kingdom had been hitherto expo&s;ed.
An act was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed, declaring the covenant to be
unlawful, and its obligation void and null. This was
a violent &s;hock to the bigotted prejudices of the na|tion.</P>
<P>IN England, the civil di&s;tinctions &s;eemed to be abo|li&s;hed
by the lenity and equality of Charles's admini&s;tra|tion.
Cavalier and round-head were heard of no more:
All men &s;eemed to concur in &s;ubmitting to the King's
lawful prerogatives, and in cheri&s;hing the ju&s;t privileges
of the people and of parliament. Theological contro|ver&s;y
alone &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and kept alive &s;ome &s;parks of
that flame, which had thrown the nation into &s;uch com|bu&s;tion.
While catholics, independants, and other
&s;ectaries were contented with entertaining &s;ome pro|&s;pect
of toleration; prelacy and pre&s;bytery &s;truggled for
the &s;uperiority, and the hopes and fears of both parties
kept them in agitation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conference at the Savoy, 25th of March.</NOTE> A conference was held in the
Savoy between twelve bi&s;hops and twelve leaders among
the pre&s;byterian mini&s;ters, with an intention, or at lea&s;t
on pretence, of bringing about an accommodation be|tween
the parties. The &s;urplice, the cro&s;s in bapti&s;m,
the kneeling at the &s;acrament, the bowing at the name
of Je&s;us, were anew canva&s;&s;ed; and the ignorant mul|titude
were in hopes, that &s;o many men of gravity and
<PB N="378" REF="472">
learning could not fail, after deliberate argumentation,
to agree in all points of controver&s;y: They were &s;ur|prized
to &s;ee them &s;eparate more inflamed than ever,
and more confirmed in their &s;everal prejudices. To en|ter
into particulars would be &s;uperfluous. Di&s;putes con|cerning
religious forms are often, in them&s;elves, the
mo&s;t frivolous of any; and merit attention only &s;o far
as they have influence on the peace and order of civil
&s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE King's declaration had promi&s;ed that &s;ome en|deavours
&s;hould be u&s;ed to effect a comprehen&s;ion of
both parties; and Charles's own indifference with re|gard
to all &s;uch que&s;tions &s;eemed a very favourable cir|cum&s;tance
for the execution of that project.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and again&s;t a comprehen|&s;ion.</NOTE> The par|tizans
of a comprehen&s;ion &s;aid, that the pre&s;byterians as

well di&s;po&s;ed towards an amicable agreement; that the
bi&s;hops, by relinqui&s;hing &s;ome part of their autho|rity,
and di&s;pen&s;ing with the mo&s;t exceptionable cere|monies,
would &s;o gratify their adver&s;aries as to obtain
their cordial and affectionate compliance, and unite the
whole nation in one faith and one wor&s;hip; that by ob&s;ti|nately
in&s;i&s;ting on forms, in them&s;elves in&s;ignificant, an
air of importance was be&s;towed on them, and men were
taught to continue equally ob&s;tinate in rejecting them; that
the pre&s;byterian clergy would go every rea&s;onable length,
rather than by parting with their livings, expo&s;e them|&s;elves
to a &s;tate of beggary, or at be&s;t of dependance;
and that if their pride were flattered by &s;ome &s;eeming
alterations, and a pretence given them for affirming,
that they had not abandoned their former principles, no|thing
farther was nece&s;&s;ary to produce a thorough union
between tho&s;e two parties, which comprehended the bulk
of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="379" REF="473">
IT was alleged on the other hand, that the difference
between religious &s;ects was founded, not on principle,
but on pa&s;&s;ion; and till the irregular affections of men
could be corrected, it was in vain to expect, by com|pliances,
to obtain a perfect unanimity and comprehen|&s;ion;
that the more in&s;ignificant the objects of di&s;pute
appeared, with the more certainty might it be inferred,
that the real ground of di&s;&s;en&s;ion was different from
that which was univer&s;ally pretended, that the love of
novelty, the pride of argumentation, the plea&s;ure of
making pro&s;elytes, and the ob&s;tinacy of contradiction,
would for ever give ri&s;e to &s;ects and di&s;putes, nor was it
po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch a &s;ource of di&s;&s;ention could ever, by
any conce&s;&s;ions, be entirely exhau&s;ted; that the church,
by departing from antient practices and principles,
would tacitly acknowlege her&s;elf guilty of error, and
lo&s;e that reverence, &s;o requi&s;ite for pre&s;erving the at|tachment
of the multitude; and that if the pre&s;ent con|ce&s;&s;ions
(which was more than probable) &s;hould prove
ineffectual, greater mu&s;t &s;till be made; and in the i&s;&s;ue,
di&s;cipline would be de&s;poiled of all its authority, and
wor&s;hip of all its decency, without obtaining that end,
which had been &s;o fondly &s;ought for by the&s;e dangerous
indulgences.</P>
<P>THE mini&s;try were inclined to give the preference to
the latter arguments; and were the more confirmed in
that intention by the di&s;po&s;ition, which appeared in the
parliament lately a&s;&s;embled. The royali&s;ts and zealous
churchmen were at pre&s;ent the popular party in the na|tion,
and, &s;econded by the efforts of the court, had
prevailed in almo&s;t every election. Not more than<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new par|ment. 8th of May.</NOTE>
fifty-&s;ix members of the pre&s;byterian party had obtained
&s;eats in the lower hou&s;e<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Carte's An&s;wer to the By&s;tander, p. 79.</NOTE>; and the&s;e were able neither
to oppo&s;e nor retard the mea&s;ures of the majority. Mo|narchy,
therefore, and epi&s;copacy, were now exalted
<PB N="380" REF="474">
to as great power and &s;plendor as they had lately &s;uffer|ed
mi&s;ery and depre&s;&s;ion. Sir Edward Turner was
cho&s;en &s;peaker.</P>
<P>AN act was pa&s;&s;ed for the &s;ecurity of the King's per|&s;on
and government. To intend or devi&s;e the King's
impri&s;onment, or bodily harm, or de&s;po&s;ition, or the
levying war again&s;t him, is declared, during the life|time
of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, to be high trea&s;on. To
affirm him to be a papi&s;t or heretic, or to endeavour by
&s;peech or writing to alienate his &s;ubjects affections from
him; the&s;e offences were made &s;ufficient to incapacitate
the per&s;on guilty from holding any employment in church
or &s;tate. To maintain that the Long Parliament is not
di&s;&s;olved, or that either or both Hou&s;es, without the
King, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of legi&s;lative authority, or that the
covenant is binding; was made puni&s;hable by the pe|nalty
of premunire.</P>
<P>THE covenant it&s;elf, together with the act for erect|ing
the high court of ju&s;tice, that for &s;ub&s;cribing the
engagement, and that for declaring England a Com|monwealth,
were ordered to be burned by the hands of
the hangman. The people a&s;&s;i&s;ted with great alacrity
on this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE abu&s;es of petitioning in the precedent reign had
been attended with the wor&s;t con&s;equences; and to pre|vent
&s;uch irregular practices for the future, it was en|acted,
that no more than twenty hands &s;hould be &s;ub|&s;cribed
to any petition, unle&s;s with the &s;anction of three
ju&s;tices, or the major part of the grand jury; and that
no petition &s;hould be pre&s;ented to the King or either
hou&s;e by above ten per&s;ons. The penalty for a tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion
of this law was a fine of a hundred pounds and
three months impri&s;onment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Bi&s;hop$ &s;eats re|&s;tored.</NOTE> THE bi&s;hops, though re&s;tored to their &s;piritual autho|rity,
were &s;till excluded from parliament by the law,
<PB N="381" REF="475">
which the late King had pa&s;&s;ed, immediately before the
commencement of the civil di&s;orders. Great violence,
both again&s;t the King and the Hou&s;e of Peers, had been
employed in pa&s;&s;ing this law; and on that account
alone, the partizans of the church were provided of a
very plau&s;ible pretence for repealing it. Charles ex|pre&s;&s;ed
much &s;atisfaction, when he gave his a&s;&s;ent to
the act for that purpo&s;e. It is certain, that the autho|rity
of the crown, as well as that of the church, was
intere&s;ted in re&s;toring the prelates to their former dig|nity.
But tho&s;e who e&s;teemed every acqui&s;ition of the
Prince a detriment to the people, were apt to complain
of this in&s;tance of complai&s;ance in the parliament.</P>
<P>AFTER an adjournment of &s;ome months, the parlia|ment
was again a&s;&s;embled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of No|vember.</NOTE> and proceeded in the &s;ame
&s;pirit as before. They di&s;covered no de&s;ign of re&s;tor|ing,
in its full extent, the antient prerogatives of the
crown: They were only anxious to repair all tho&s;e
breaches, which had been made, not by the love of li|berty,
but by the fury of faction and civil war. The
power of the &s;word had, in all ages, been allowed to
be ve&s;ted in the crown; and though no law conferred
this prerogative, every parliament, till the la&s;t of the
preceding reign, had willingly &s;ubmitted to an autho|rity
more antient, and therefore more &s;acred, than that
of any po&s;itive &s;tatute. It was now thought proper &s;o|lemnly
to relinqui&s;h the violent preten&s;ions of that par|liament,
and to acknowlege, that neither one hou&s;e,
nor both hou&s;es, independant of the King, were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of any military authority. The preamble to this
&s;tatute went &s;o far as to renounce all right even of <HI>defen|&s;ive</HI>
arms again&s;t the King; and much ob&s;ervation has
been made with regard to a conce&s;&s;ion, e&s;teemed &s;o &s;in|gular.
Were tho&s;e terms taken in their full literal
&s;en&s;e, they imply a total renunciation of limitations to
monarchy, and of all privileges in the &s;ubject, indepen|dant
<PB N="382" REF="476">
of the will of the Sovereign. For as no rights can
&s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome remedy, much le&s;s rights expo&s;ed
to &s;o much inva&s;ion from tyranny or even from ambi|tion;
if &s;ubjects mu&s;t never re&s;i&s;t, it is certain, that
every Prince, without any effort, policy, or violence,
is at once rendered ab&s;olute and uncontroulable:
The Sovereign needs only i&s;&s;ue an edict, aboli&s;hing
every authority but his own; and all liberty, from that
moment, is in effect annihilated. But this meaning it
were ab&s;urd to impute to the pre&s;ent parliament, who,
though zealous royali&s;ts, &s;howed, in their mea&s;ures,
that they had not ca&s;t off all regard to national privi|leges.
They were probably &s;en&s;ible, that to &s;uppo&s;e in
the Sovereign any &s;uch inva&s;ion of public liberty is en|tirely
uncon&s;titutional; and that therefore expre&s;sly to
re&s;erve, upon that event, any right of re&s;i&s;tance in the
&s;ubject mu&s;t be liable to the &s;ame objection. They had
&s;een that the Long Parliament, under colour of defence,
had begun a violent attack upon kingly power; and
after involving the kingdom in blood, had finally lo&s;t
that liberty, for which they had &s;o imprudently con|tended.
They thought, though perhaps erroneou&s;ly,
that it was no longer po&s;&s;ible, after &s;uch exorbitant
preten&s;ions, to per&s;evere in that prudent &s;ilence, hitherto
maintained by the laws, and that it was nece&s;&s;ary, by
&s;ome po&s;itive declaration, to bar the return of like in|conveniences.
When they excluded, therefore, the
right of defence, they &s;uppo&s;ed, that, the con&s;titution
remaining firm upon its ba&s;is, there never really could
be an attack made by the Sovereign. If &s;uch an attack
was at any time made, the nece&s;&s;ity was then extreme:
And the ca&s;e of extreme and violent nece&s;&s;ity, no laws,
they thought, could comprehend; becau&s;e to &s;uch a
nece&s;&s;ity no laws could beforehand point out a proper
remedy.</P>
<P><PB N="383" REF="477">
THE other mea&s;ures of this parliament &s;till di&s;covered
a more anxious care to guard again&s;t rebellion in the
&s;ubjects than encroachments in the crown: The recent
evils of civil war and u&s;urpation had naturally increa&s;ed
the &s;pirit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the monarch, and had thrown
the nation into that dangerous extreme. During the
violent and jealous government of the parliament and of
the Protectors, all magi&s;trates, liable to &s;u&s;picion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Corporation act.</NOTE> had
been expelled the corporations; and none had been
admitted, who gave not proofs of affection to the ruling
powers, or who refu&s;ed to &s;ub&s;cribe the covenant. To
leave all authority in &s;uch hands &s;eemed dangerous; and
the parliament, therefore, empowered the King to ap|point
commi&s;&s;ioners for regulating the corporations,
and expelling &s;uch magi&s;trates as either had intruded
them&s;elves by violence, or profe&s;&s;ed principles, dange|rous
to the con&s;titution, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical. It was
al&s;o enacted, that all magi&s;trates &s;hould di&s;claim the
obligation of the covenant, and &s;hould declare, both
their belief, that it was not lawful, upon any pretence
what&s;oever, to take arms again&s;t the King, and their
abhorrence of the traiterous po&s;ition of taking arms by
the King's authority again&s;t his per&s;on, or again&s;t tho&s;e
commi&s;&s;ioned by him.</P>
<P>WHEN the latter part of this oath, the words, <HI>com|mi&s;&s;ioned
by him,</HI> which &s;eem the mo&s;t dangerous to the
con&s;titution, came to be debated, it was moved in the
Hou&s;e, and earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by Sir John Vaughan, an
eminent lawyer, that the word, <HI>lawfully,</HI> might be add|ed,
in order to remove all difficulties. But the Attor|ney-General,
Sir Heneage Finch, an&s;wered, that it
was not nece&s;&s;ary: The very word, commi&s;&s;ion, im|ported
it; &s;ince any power, not lawfully i&s;&s;ued, to law|ful
per&s;ons, and for a lawful purpo&s;e, was in reality no
commi&s;&s;ion: And the whole Hou&s;e &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ent to
this interpretation. The &s;ame word, <HI>lawfully,</HI> was en|deavoured
<PB N="384" REF="478">
to be added by Southampton him&s;elf, in the
Hou&s;e of Peers; but a like an&s;wer was made by Angle|&s;ey.
Southampton &s;till in&s;i&s;ted, that &s;uch an addition
would clear all ob&s;curities; and that many, not having
heard the particular &s;en&s;e of the parliament, might
fancy, that, if any &s;ort of commi&s;&s;ion was granted, it
would not be lawful to re&s;i&s;t it: But that worthy pa|triot
could not prevail. The opinion of both parties,
it is to be pre&s;umed, was the &s;ame; Though the fear of
affording a pretence to rebellion made the royali&s;ts ra&s;hly
overlook the danger, to which liberty might be expo&s;ed
by &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions. They thought, that in mo&s;t hu|man
deliberation, it was difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to
make a choice which was not expo&s;ed to &s;ome inconve|nience.
And it is but too u&s;ual for victorious parties,
who had &s;uffered under oppre&s;&s;ion, to &s;ignalize their
triumph over their adver&s;aries, by carrying matters to
the extremity mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to that which had formerly
prevailed.</P>
<P>THE care of the church was no le&s;s prevalent with
this parliament than that of monarchy;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1662.</NOTE> and the bill of
uniformity was a pledge of their &s;incere attachment to
the epi&s;copal hierarchy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Act of uni|formity.</NOTE> and of their antipathy to pre&s;|byteriani&s;m.
Different parties, however, concurred in
promoting this bill, which contained many &s;evere
clau&s;es. The independants and other &s;ectaries, enraged
to find all their &s;chemes &s;ubverted by the pre&s;byterians,
who had once been their a&s;&s;ociates, exerted them&s;elves
to di&s;appoint that party of the favour and indulgence,
to which, from their recent merits in promoting the re|&s;toration,
they thought them&s;elves ju&s;tly entitled. By
the pre&s;byterians, &s;aid they, the war was rai&s;ed: By
them were the populace fir&s;t incited to tumults: By
their zeal, intere&s;t, and riches were the armies &s;up|ported:
By their force was the King &s;ubdued: And if,
<PB N="385" REF="479">
in the &s;equel, they prote&s;ted again&s;t tho&s;e extreme vio|lences,
committed on his per&s;on by the military leaders,
their oppo&s;ition came too late, after having &s;upplied the&s;e
u&s;urpers with the power and the pretences, by which
they maintained their &s;anguinary mea&s;ures. They had
indeed concurred with the royali&s;ts in recalling the King:
But ought they to be e&s;teemed, on that account, more
affectionate to the royal cau&s;e? Rage and animo&s;ity,
rai&s;ed by di&s;appointed ambition, were plainly their &s;ole
motives; and if the King &s;hould now be &s;o imprudent
as to di&s;tingui&s;h them by any particular indulgences, he
would &s;oon experience from them the &s;ame hatred and
oppo&s;ition, which proved &s;o fatal to his father.</P>
<P>THE catholics, though they had little intere&s;t in the
nation, were a con&s;iderable party at court; and from
their great &s;ervices and &s;ufferings, during the civil wars,
it &s;eemed but ju&s;t to bear them &s;ome favour and regard.
The&s;e religioni&s;ts dreaded an entire union among the
prote&s;tants. Were they the &s;ole nonconformi&s;ts in the
nation, the &s;evere execution of penal laws upon their
&s;ect &s;eemed an infallible con&s;equence; and they u&s;ed all
their intere&s;t to pu&s;h matters to extremity again&s;t the
pre&s;byterians, who had formerly been their mo&s;t &s;evere
oppre&s;&s;ors, and whom they now expected for their com|panions
in affliction. The Earl of Bri&s;tol, who, from
conviction, or intere&s;t, or levity, or complai&s;ance for
the company with whom he lived, had changed his re|ligion
during the King's exile, was regarded as the head
of this party.</P>
<P>THE church party had, during &s;o many years, &s;uf|fered
&s;uch injuries and indignities from the &s;ectaries of
every denomination, that no moderation, much le&s;s defe|rence,
was on this occa&s;ion to be expected in their ec|cle&s;ia&s;tics.
Even the laity of that communion &s;eemed
now di&s;po&s;ed to retaliate upon their enemies, according
to the u&s;ual mea&s;ures of party ju&s;tice. This &s;ect or
<PB N="386" REF="480">
faction (for it was a mixture of both) encouraged the
rumours of plots and con&s;piracies again&s;t the govern|ment;
crimes, which, without any apparent cau&s;e,
they imputed to their adver&s;aries. And in&s;tead of en|larging
their terms of communion, in order to compre|hend
the pre&s;byterians, they gladly laid hold of the pre|judices,
which prevailed among that &s;ect, in order to
eject them from all their livings. By the bill of uni|formity
it was required, that every clergyman &s;hould be
re-ordained, if he had not before received epi&s;copal or|dination;
&s;hould declare his a&s;&s;ent to every thing con|tained
in the Book of Common Prayer; &s;hould take
the oath of canonical obedience; &s;hould abjure the &s;o|lemn
league and covenant, and &s;hould renounce the
principle of taking arms, on any pretence what&s;oever,
again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>THIS bill re-in&s;tated the church in the &s;ame condi|tion,
in which it &s;tood before the commencement of the
civil wars; and as the old per&s;ecuting laws of Elizabeth
&s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in their full rigor, and new clau&s;es of a
like nature were now enacted, all the King's promi&s;es
of toleration and of indulgence to tender con&s;ciences
were thereby eluded and broken. 'Tis true, Charles,
in his declaration from Breda, had expre&s;&s;ed his inten|tion
of regulating that indulgence by the advice and au|thority
of parliament: But this limitation could never
rea&s;onably be extended to a total infringement and vio|lation
of his promi&s;e. It is agreed, that the King did
not voluntarily concur with this violent mea&s;ure, and
that the zeal of Clarendon and of the church party among
the Commons, &s;econded by the intrigues of the catholics,
was the real cau&s;e, which extorted his con&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE royali&s;ts, who now predominated, were very
ready to &s;ignalize their victory, by e&s;tabli&s;hing tho&s;e
high principles of monarchy, which their antagoni&s;ts
had controverted: But when any real power or revenue
<PB N="387" REF="481">
was demanded for the crown, they were neither &s;o for|ward
nor &s;o liberal in their conce&s;&s;ions as the King
would gladly have wi&s;hed. Though the parliament
pa&s;&s;ed laws for regulating the navy, they took no no|tice
of the army; and declined giving their &s;anction to
this dangerous innovation. The King's debts were be|come
intolerable; and the Commons were at la&s;t con|&s;trained
to vote him an extraordinary &s;upply of 1,200,000
pounds, to be levied by eighteen months a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.
But be&s;ides that this &s;upply was much inferior to the oc|ca&s;ion,
the King was obliged earne&s;tly to &s;ollicit the
Commons, before he could obtain it; and, in order to
convince the Hou&s;e of its ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, he de&s;ired
them to examine &s;trictly into all his receipts and di&s;|bur&s;ements.
Finding likewi&s;e upon enquiry, that the
&s;everal branches of revenue fell much &s;hort of the &s;ums
expected, they at la&s;t, after much delay, voted a new
impo&s;ition of two &s;hillings on each hearth; and this tax
they &s;ettled on the King during life. The whole e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
revenue, however, did not, for many years,
exceed a million<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">D'Egrades, 25th of July, 1761. Mr. Ralph's Hi&s;tory, vol. i. p. 176.</NOTE>; a &s;um confe&s;&s;edly too narrow for the
public expences. A very rigid frugality at lea&s;t, which
the King wanted, would have been requi&s;ite to make it
&s;uffice for the dignity and &s;ecurity of the government.
After all bu&s;ine&s;s was di&s;patched,<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of May</NOTE> the parliament was
prorogued.</P>
<P>BEFORE the parliament ro&s;e,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's mar|riage.</NOTE> the court was employed
in making preparations for the reception of the new
Queen, Catherine of Portugal, to whom the King was
betrothed, and who had ju&s;t landed at Port&s;mouth. Dur|ing
the time, that the Protector carried on the war with
Spain, he was naturally led to &s;upport the Portugue&s;e in
their revolt; and he engaged him&s;elf by treaty to &s;upply
them with 10,000 men for their defence again&s;t the
Spaniards. On the King's re&s;toration, advances were
<PB N="388" REF="482">
made by Portugal for the renewal of that alliance; and
in order to bind the friend&s;hip clo&s;er, an offer was
made of the Portugue&s;e Prince&s;s, and a portion of
300,000 pounds, together with two fortre&s;&s;es, Tangiers
in Africa and Bombay in the Ea&s;t Indies. Spain, who,
after the peace of the Pyrenees, bent all her force to re|cover
Portugal, now in appearance abandoned by
France, took the alarm, and endeavoured to fix Charles
in an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t. The Catholick King offered to
adopt any other Prince&s;s as a daughter of Spain, either
the Prince&s;s of Parma, or, what he thought more po|pular,
&s;ome Prote&s;tant Prince&s;s, the daughter of Den|mark,
Saxony, or Orange: And on any of the&s;e, he
promi&s;ed to confer a dowry equal to that offered by Por|tugal.
But many rea&s;ons inclined Charles rather to ac|cept
of the Portugue&s;e propo&s;als. The great di&s;orders
in the government and finances of Spain, made the
execution of her promi&s;es be much doubted; and the
King's urgent wants demanded &s;ome &s;upply of money.
The intere&s;t of the Engli&s;h commerce likewi&s;e &s;eemed
to require, that the independancy of Portugal &s;hould be
&s;upported, le&s;t the union of that crown with Spain
&s;hould put the whole trea&s;ures of America into the
hands of one potentate. The claims too of Spain upon
Dunkirk and Jamaica, rendered it impo&s;&s;ible, without
farther conce&s;&s;ions, to obtain the cordial friend&s;hip of
that power: And on the other hand, the offer, made
by Portugal, of two &s;uch con&s;iderable fortre&s;&s;es, pro|mi&s;ed
a great acce&s;&s;ion to the naval force of England.
Above all, the propo&s;al of a Prote&s;tant Prince&s;s, was
no allurement to Charles, who&s;e inclinations led him
&s;trongly to give the preference to a Catholic alliance.
According to the mo&s;t probable accounts<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 254. This account &s;eems better &s;upported, than that in Ablancourt's Memoirs, that the Chancellor chiefly pu&s;hed the Portugue&s;e alliance. The &s;ecret tran&s;actions of the court of England could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be much known to a French re&s;ident at Li&s;bon: And whatever oppo&s;ition the Chancellor made, he would certainly endeavour to conceal it from the Queen and all her family; and even in the parliament and council would &s;upport the re&s;olution already taken.</NOTE>, the re&s;olu|tion
<PB N="389" REF="483">
of marrying the daughter of Portugal was taken by
the King, unknown to all his mini&s;ters; and no re|mon&s;trances
could prevail with him to alter his inten|tions.
The Chancellor, with Ormond and Southamp|ton,
urged many oppo&s;ite rea&s;ons; and particularly in|&s;i&s;ted
on a report, which was current, of the incapacity
of the Prince&s;s to have children: But their arguments
were rejected. When the matter was laid before the
council, all voices concurred in approving the re&s;olu|tion;
and the parliament expre&s;&s;ed the &s;ame complai&s;|ance.
And thus was concluded, &s;eemingly with uni|ver&s;al
con&s;ent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21th of May</NOTE> the inau&s;picious marriage with Cathe|rine,
a Prince&s;s of virtue, but who was never able,
either by the graces of her per&s;on or humour, to make
her&s;elf agreeable to the King. The report however of
her natural incapacity to have children, &s;eems to have
been groundle&s;s; &s;ince &s;he was twice declared to be
pregnant<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;down's Defence of General Monk. Temple, vol. ii. p. 154.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fe&s;tivity of the&s;e e&s;pou&s;als was clouded by the
trial and execution of criminals. Berk&s;tead, Cobbe$,
and Okey, three regicides, had e&s;caped beyond &s;ea;
and after wandering &s;ome time concealed in Germany,
came privately to Delft, having appointed their families
to meet them in that place. They were di&s;covered by
Downing, the King's re&s;ident in Holland, who had
formerly &s;erved the Protector and Commonwealth in the
&s;ame &s;tation, and who once had even been Chaplain to
Okey's regiment. He applied to the States for a war|rant
to arre&s;t them. It had been u&s;ual for the States to
grant the&s;e warrants; though at the &s;ame time, they
had ever been careful &s;ecretly to adverti&s;e the per&s;ons,
<PB N="390" REF="484">
that they might be enabled to make their e&s;cape. This
precaution was eluded by the vigilance and di&s;patch of
Downing. He quickly &s;eized the criminals, hurried
them on board a frigate which lay off the coa&s;t, and
&s;ent them to England. The&s;e three men behaved with
more moderation and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion than any of the other
regicides, who had &s;uffered. Okey in particular, at
the place of execution, prayed for the King, and ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his intention, had he lived, of &s;ubmitting peace|ably
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed government. He had ri&s;en dur|ing
the wars from being a chandler in London to a high
rank in the army; and in all his conduct appeared to be
of a man humanity and honour. In con&s;ideration of his
good character and of his dutiful behaviour, his body
was given his friends to be buried.</P>
<P>THE attention of the public was much engaged by
the trial of two di&s;tingui&s;hed criminals, Lambert and
Vane. The&s;e men, though none of the immediate
murderers of the King, had been excepted from the ge|neral
indemnity, and committed to pri&s;on. The Con|vention-Parliament,
however, was &s;o favourable to
them, as to petition the King, if they &s;hould be found
guilty, to &s;u&s;pend their execution: But this new
parliament, more zealous for monarchy, applied for
their trial and condemnation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Vane.</NOTE> Not to revive di&s;putes,
which were better buried in oblivion, the indictment of
Vane did not comprehend any of his actions during the
war between the King and parliament: It extended
only to his behaviour after the late King's death, as
member of the Council of State, and Secretary of the
Navy; where fidelity to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, re|quired
his oppo&s;ition to monarchy.</P>
<P>VANE wanted neither courage nor capacity to avail
him&s;elf of this advantage. He urged, that, if a com|pliance
with the government, at that time e&s;tabli&s;hed in
<PB N="391" REF="485">
England, and an acknowledgment of its authority were
to be regarded as criminal, the whole nation had incur|red
equal guilt, and none would remain, who&s;e inno|cence
could entitle them to try or condemn him for his
pretended trea&s;ons: That, according to the&s;e maxims,
wherever an illegal authority was e&s;tabli&s;hed by force, a
total and univer&s;al de&s;truction mu&s;t en&s;ue; while the
u&s;urpers pro&s;cribed one part of the nation for di&s;obe|dience,
the lawful Prince puni&s;hed the other for com|pliance:
That the legi&s;lature of England, fore&s;eeing
this violent &s;ituation, had provided for public &s;ecurity
by the famous &s;tatute of Henry the &s;eventh; in which
it was enacted, that no man, in ca&s;e of any revolution,
&s;hould ever be que&s;tioned for his obedience to the King
in being: That whether the e&s;tabli&s;hed government
was a Monarchy or a Commonwealth, the rea&s;on of
the thing was &s;till the &s;ame; nor ought the expelled
Prince to think him&s;elf entitled to allegiance, &s;o long
as he could not afford protection: That it belonged not
to private per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no power, to di&s;cu&s;s the
title of their governors; and every u&s;urpation, even the
mo&s;t flagrant, would equally require obedience with
the mo&s;t legal e&s;tabli&s;hment: That the controver&s;y be|tween
the late King and his parliament was of the mo&s;t
delicate nature; and men of the greate&s;t probity had been
divided in their choice of the party which they &s;hould
embrace: That the parliament, being rendered undi&s;|&s;oluble
but by their own con&s;ent, was become a kind
of co-ordinate power with the King; and as the ca&s;e
was thus entirely new and unknown to the con&s;titution,
it ought not to be tried rigidly by the letter of the an|tient
laws: That for his part, all the violences, which
had been put upon the parliament, and upon the per&s;on
of the Sovereign, he had ever condemned; nor had he
once appeared in the Hou&s;e for &s;ome time before and
after the execution of the King: That, finding the
<PB N="392" REF="486">
whole government thrown into di&s;order, he was &s;till re|&s;olved,
in every revolution, to adhere to the Com|mons,
the root, the foundation of all lawful autho|rity:
That in pro&s;ecution of this principle, he had
cheerfully undergone all the violence of Cromwel's ty|ranny;
and would now, with equal alacrity, expo&s;e
him&s;elf to the rigours of perverted law and ju&s;tice:
That though it was in his power, on the King's re&s;to|ration,
to have e&s;caped from his enemies, he was deter|mined,
in imitation of the mo&s;t illu&s;trious names of an|tiquity,
to peri&s;h in defence of liberty, and to give te&s;|timony
with his blood for that honourable cau&s;e, in
which he had been inli&s;ted: And that, be&s;ides the ties,
with which God and nature had bound him to his na|tive
country, he was voluntarily engaged by the mo&s;t
&s;acred covenant, who&s;e obligation no earthly power
&s;hould ever be able to make him relinqui&s;h.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of June</NOTE> ALL the defence, which Vane could make, was fruit|le&s;s.
The court, con&s;idering more the general opinion
of his active guilt in the beginning and pro&s;ecution of
the civil wars, than the articles of trea&s;on charged
again&s;t him, took advantage of the letter of the law,
and brought him in guilty. His courage de&s;erted him
not upon his condemnation. Though timid by nature,
the per&s;ua&s;ion of a ju&s;t cau&s;e &s;upported him again&s;t
the terrors of death; while his enthu&s;ia&s;m, excited by
the pro&s;pect of glory, embelli&s;hed the conclu&s;ion of a
life, which, through the whole cour&s;e of it, had been
&s;o much disfigured by the prevalence of that principle.
Le&s;t pity for a courageous &s;ufferer &s;hould make impre&s;|&s;ion
on the populace, drummers were placed under the
&s;caffold,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu|tion. 14th of June</NOTE> who&s;e noi&s;e, as he began to launch out in
reflections on the government, drowned his voice, and
admoni&s;hed him to temper the ardour of his zeal. He
was not a&s;toni&s;hed at this unexpected incident. In all
his behaviour, there appeared a firm and animated in|trepidity;
<PB N="393" REF="487">
and he con&s;idered death but as as a pa&s;&s;age
to that eternal felicity, which he believed to be pre|pared
for him.</P>
<P>THIS man, &s;o celebrated for his parliamentary ta|lents,
and for his capacity in bu&s;ine&s;s, has left &s;ome
writings behind him: They treat all of them, of reli|gious
&s;ubjects, and are ab&s;olutely unintelligible: No
traces of eloquence, or even of common &s;en&s;e appea$
in them. A &s;trange paradox! did we not know, that
men of the greate&s;t genius, where they relinqui&s;h by
principle the u&s;e of their rea&s;on, are only enabled by
their vigour of mind, to work them&s;elves the deeper
into error and ab&s;urdity. It was remarked, that, as
Vane, by being the chief in&s;trument of Strafford's death,
had fir&s;t opened the way for that de&s;truction, which
overwhelmed the nation; &s;o by his own death he clo&s;ed
the &s;cene of blood. He was the la&s;t that &s;uffered on ac|count
of the civil wars. Lambert, though condemned,
was reprieved at the bar; and the judges declared, that,
if Vane's behaviour had been equally dutiful and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive,
he would have experienced like lenity in the
King. Lambert &s;urvived his condemnation near thirty
years. He was confined to the i&s;le of Guerne&s;ey;
where he lived contented, forgetting all his pa&s;t &s;chemes
of greatne&s;s, and entirely forgot by the nation.</P>
<P>HOWEVER odious Vane and Lambert to the pre&s;by|terians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pre&s;byteria$ clergy eject|ed. 24th of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE>
that party had no lei&s;ure to rejoice at their con|demnation.
The fatal St. Bartholomew approached;
the day, when the clergy were obliged by the late law,
either to relinqui&s;h their livings, or to &s;ign the articles
required of them. A combination had been entered
into by the more zealous of the pre&s;byterian eccle&s;ia&s;|tics
to refu&s;e the &s;ub&s;cription; in hopes, that the
bi&s;hops would not dare at once to expel &s;o great a num|ber
of the mo&s;t popular preachers. The catholic party
at court, who de&s;ired a great rent among the prote&s;|tants,
<PB N="394" REF="488">
encouraged them in this ob&s;tinacy, and gave them
hopes, that the King would protect them in their refu|&s;al.
The King him&s;elf, by his irre&s;olute conduct, con|tributed,
either from de&s;ign or accident, to increa&s;e this
opinion. Above all, the terms of &s;ub&s;cription had been
made very &s;trict and rigid, on purpo&s;e to di&s;gu&s;t all the
zealous and &s;crupulous among the pre&s;byterians, and
deprive them of their livings. About 2000 of the clergy,
in one day, relinqui&s;hed their cures; and to the great
a&s;toni&s;hment of the court, &s;acrificed their intere&s;t to their
religious tenets. Fortified by &s;ociety in their &s;ufferings,
they were re&s;olved to undergo any hard&s;hips, rather
than openly renounce tho&s;e principles, which, on other
occa&s;ions, they were &s;o apt, from intere&s;t, to warp or
elude. The church enjoyed the plea&s;ure of retaliation;
and even pu&s;hed, as u&s;ual, the vengeance farther than
the offence. During the dominion of the parliamentary
party, a fifth of the livings had been left to the ejected
clergy; but this indulgence, though at fir&s;t in&s;i&s;ted on
by the Hou&s;e of Peers, was now refu&s;ed to the pre&s;by|terians.
However difficult to conciliate peace among
theologicians, it was hoped by many that &s;ome relaxa|tion
in the terms of communion might have kept the
pre&s;byterians united to the church, and have cured tho&s;e
eccle&s;ia&s;tical factions, which had been &s;o fatal, and
were &s;till &s;o dangerous. Bi&s;hoprics were offered to
Calamy, Baxter and Reynolds, great leaders among the
pre&s;byterians; the la&s;t only could be prevailed with to
accept. Deaneries and other promotions were refu&s;ed by

<P>THE next mea&s;ure of the King has not had the
good fortune to be ju&s;tified by any party; but is often

of his reign: 'Tis the &s;ale of Dunkirk to the

and the liberal, not to &s;ay lavi&s;h, di&s;po&s;ition of the
<PB N="395" REF="489">
King, were but ill &s;uited to each other; and notwith|&s;tanding
all the &s;upplies voted him, his trea&s;ury was
&s;till very empty and very much indebted. He had re|ceived
the &s;um of 200,000 crowns from France; but
the forces &s;ent over to Portugal, and the fleets, main|tained
in order to defend that kingdom, had already
co&s;t the King that &s;um, and together with it, above
double the money, which he had received for the
Queen's dowry<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'E&s;trade, 17th of Augu&s;t, 1662.</NOTE>. The time fixed for payment of his
&s;i&s;ter's portion to the Duke of Orleans was now ap|proaching.
Tangiers, a fortre&s;s from which great be|nefit
was expected, was become an additional burthen
on the crown; and Rutherford, who now commanded
in Dunkirk, had increa&s;ed the charge of that garri&s;on
to a hundred and twenty thou&s;and pounds a year. The&s;e
con&s;iderations had &s;uch influence, not only on the
King, but even on Clarendon, that that uncorrupt mi|ni&s;ter
was the mo&s;t forward to advi&s;e the accepting a
&s;um of money in lieu of a place which, he thought, the
King, from the narrow &s;tate of his revenue, was no
longer able to retain. By the treaty with Portugal, it
was &s;tipulated, that Dunkirk &s;hould never be yielded to
the Spaniards: France was therefore the only purcha&s;er
that remained. D'E&s;trades was invited over by a letter
from the Chancellor him&s;elf, in order to conclude the
bargain. Nine hundred thou&s;and pounds were demand|ed:
One hundred thou&s;and were offered. The Engli&s;h
by degrees lowered their demands: The French rai&s;ed
their offer: And the bargain was &s;truck at 400,000
pounds. The artillery and &s;tores were valued at a fifth
of the &s;um<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Id. 21&s;t of Augu&s;t. 12th of September, 1662.</NOTE>. The importance of this &s;ale was not,
at that time, &s;ufficiently known, either abroad or at
home<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">It appears, however, from many of D'E&s;trade's letters, particularly that of the 21&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1661, that the King might have transferred Dunkirk to the parliament, who would not have refu&s;ed to bear the charges of it, but were unwilling to give money to the King for that purpo&s;e. The King on the other hand was jealous, le&s;t the parliament &s;hould acquire any &s;uch &s;epa|rate dominion or authority: A proof that the government was not as yet &s;ettled into that compo&s;ure, and mutual confidence, which is ab&s;olutely re|qui&s;ite for conducting it.</NOTE>. The French monarch him&s;elf, though &s;o fond
<PB N="396" REF="490">
of acqui&s;itions, and &s;o good a judge of his own inte|re&s;ts,
thought that he had made a very hard bargain<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Id. 3d of October, 1662. The chief importance indeed of Dunkirk to the Engli&s;h was that it was able extremely to di&s;tre&s;s their trade, when in the hands of the French: But it was Lewis the XIVth who fir&s;t made it a good &s;ea-port. England can have no occa&s;ion to tran&s;port armies, to the continent, but in &s;upport of &s;ome ally who&s;e towns &s;erve to the &s;ame purpo&s;e as Dunkirk would, if in the hands of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE>;
and this &s;um, in appearance &s;o &s;mall, was the utmo&s;t,
which he would allow his Amba&s;&s;ador to offer.</P>
<P>A NEW incident di&s;covered &s;uch a glimp&s;e of the
King's character and principles of policy as at fir&s;t the
nation was &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s how to interpret, but
&s;uch as &s;ub&s;equent events, by degrees, rendered &s;uffi|ciently
plain and manife&s;t.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indul|gence. 26th of De|cember.</NOTE> He i&s;&s;ued a declaration on

as may enable him to exerci&s;e, with a more
univer&s;al &s;atisfaction, that power of di&s;pen&s;ing, which
he conceived to be inherent in him<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Kennet's Regi&s;ter, p. 850.</NOTE>.&endq; Here a mo&s;t
important prerogative was exerci&s;ed by the King; but
under &s;uch artificial re&s;erves and limitations as might
prevent the full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the claim, and obviate a
breach between him and his parliament. The founda|tion
of this mea&s;ure lay much deeper, and was of the
utmo&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE King, during his exile, had imbibed &s;trong pre|judices
in favour of the catholic religion; and accord|ing
to the mo&s;t probable accounts, had already been re|conciled
in form to the church of Rome. The great
zeal, expre&s;&s;ed by the parliamentary party again&s;t all
papi&s;ts, had always, from a &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition, inclin|ed
the court and all the royali&s;ts to adopt more favour|able
&s;entiments towards that &s;ect, who, through the
whole cour&s;e of the civil wars, had &s;trenuou&s;ly &s;up|ported
the rights of the Sovereign. The rigour too,
which the King, during his abode in Scotland, had ex|perienced
from the pre&s;byterians, di&s;po&s;ed him to run into
the other extreme, and to bear a kindne&s;s to the party,
mo&s;t oppo&s;ite in its genius to the &s;everity of tho&s;e reli|gioni&s;ts.
The &s;ollicitations and importunities of the
Queen-mother, the contagion of the company which
he frequented, the view of a more &s;plendid and courtly
mode of wor&s;hip, the hopes of indulgence in plea&s;ure;
all the&s;e cau&s;es operated powerfully on a young Prince,
who&s;e carele&s;s and di&s;&s;olute temper made him incapable
of adhering clo&s;ely to the principles of his early educa|tion.
But if the thoughtle&s;s humour of Charles ren|dered
him an ea&s;y convert to popery, the &s;ame di&s;po&s;i|tion
<PB N="398" REF="492">
ever prevented the theological tenets of that &s;ect
from taking any fa&s;t hold of him. During his vigorous
&s;tate of health, while his blood was warm and his &s;pi|rits
high, a contempt and di&s;regard of all religion held
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind; and he might more properly be
denominated a dei&s;t than a catholic. But in tho&s;e revo|lutions
of temper, when the love of raillery gave place
to reflection, and his penetrating, but negligent under|&s;tanding
was clouded with fears and apprehen&s;ions, he
had &s;tarts of more &s;incere conviction, and a &s;ect, which
always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his inclinations, was then ma&s;ter of his
judgment and opinion.</P>
<P>BUT though the King thus floated, during his whole
reign, between irreligion, which he more openly pro|fe&s;&s;ed,
and popery, to which he retained a &s;ecret pro|pen&s;ity,
his brother, the Duke of York, had zealou&s;ly
adopted all the principles of that theological party. His
eager temper and narrow under&s;tanding made him a
thorough convert, without any re&s;erve from intere&s;t, or
doubts from rea&s;oning and enquiry. By his application
to bu&s;ine&s;s, he had acquired a great a&s;cendant over the
King, who, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much more di&s;cern|ment,
was glad to throw the burthen of affairs on the
Duke, of whom he entertained little jealou&s;y. On
pretence of ea&s;ing the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters, they agreed
upon a plan for introducing a general toleration, and
giving the catholics the free exerci&s;e of their religion;
at lea&s;t, the exerci&s;e of it in private hou&s;es. The two
brothers &s;aw with plea&s;ure &s;o numerous and popular a
body of the clergy refu&s;e conformity; and it was hoped,
that, under &s;helter of their name, the &s;mall and hated
&s;ect of the catholics might meet with favour and pro|tection.</P>
<P>BUT while the King pleaded his early promi&s;es of
toleration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1663. 18th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> and in&s;i&s;ted on many other plau&s;ible topics,
<PB N="399" REF="493">
the parliament, who &s;at a little after the declaration
was i&s;&s;ued, could by no means be &s;atisfied with this
mea&s;ure. The declared intention of ea&s;ing the di&s;&s;en|ters,
and the &s;ecret purpo&s;e of favouring the catholics,
were equally di&s;agreeable to them; and in the&s;e prepo&s;|&s;ions
they were encouraged by the King's mini&s;ters
them&s;elves, particularly the Chancellor. The Hou&s;e of
Commons repre&s;ented to the King, that his declaration
of Breda contained no promi&s;e to the pre&s;byterians and
other di&s;&s;enters, but only an expre&s;&s;ion of his intentions,
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of the parliament's concurrence;
that even if the nonconformi&s;ts had been entitled to
plead a promi&s;e, they had entru&s;ted this claim as well
as all their other rights and privileges, to the Hou&s;e of
Commons, who were their repre&s;entatives, and who
now freed the King from that obligation; that it was
not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that his Maje&s;ty and the Hou&s;es were
&s;o bound by that declaration as to be incapacitated from
making any laws, which might be contrary to it; that
even at the King's re&s;toration, there were laws of uni|formity
in force, which could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with but
by act of parliament; and that the indulgence propo&s;ed
would prove mo&s;t pernicious both to church and &s;tate,
would open the door to &s;chi&s;m, encourage faction, di|&s;turb
the public peace, and di&s;credit the wi&s;dom of the
legi&s;lature. The King did not think proper, after this
remon&s;trance, to in&s;i&s;t any farther at pre&s;ent on the pro|$ect
of indulgence.</P>
<P>IN order to deprive the catholics of all hopes, the
two Hou&s;es concurred in a remon&s;trance again&s;t them.
The King gave a very gracious an&s;wer; though he
&s;crupled not to profe&s;s his gratitude towards many of
that per&s;ua&s;ion, on account of their faithful &s;ervices in
his father's cau&s;e and in his own. A proclamation, for
form's &s;ake, was &s;oon after i&s;&s;ued again&s;t Je&s;uits and
Romi&s;h prie&s;ts: But care was taken, by the very terms
<PB N="400" REF="494">
of it, to render it ineffectual. The parliament had al|lowed,
that all the foreign prie&s;ts, belonging to the two
Queens, &s;hould be excepted, and that a permi&s;&s;ion for
them to remain in England &s;hould &s;till be granted. In
the proclamation, the word <HI>foreign,</HI> was purpo&s;ely
omitted; and the Queens were thereby authorized to
give protection to as many Engli&s;h prie&s;ts as they &s;hould
think proper.</P>
<P>THAT the King might reap &s;ome advantage from his
compliances, however fallacious, he engaged the Commons
anew into an examination of his revenue, which, chiefly
by the negligence in levying it, had proved, he &s;aid,
much inferior to the public charges. Notwith&s;tanding
the price of Dunkirk, his debts, he complained, amount|ed
to a con&s;iderable &s;um; and to &s;atisfy the Commons,
that the money formerly granted him, had not been pro|digally
expended, he offered to lay before them the
whole account of his di&s;bur&s;ements. It is however
agreed on all hands, that the King, though during his
bani&s;hment, he had managed his &s;mall and precarious
income with great order and oeconomy, had now much
abated of the&s;e virtues, and was unable to make his
royal revenues &s;uffice for his expences. The Commons,
without entering into too nice a di&s;qui&s;ition, voted him
four &s;ub&s;idies; and this was the la&s;t time, that taxes
were levied in that manner.</P>
<P>SEVERAL laws were made this &s;e&s;&s;ion with regard to
trade. The militia al&s;o came under con&s;ideration, and
&s;ome rules were e&s;tabli&s;hed for ordering and arming it.
It was enacted, that the King &s;hould have no power of
keeping the militia under arms above fourteen days in
the year. The &s;ituation of this i&s;land, together with
its great naval power, has always occa&s;ioned other
means of &s;ecurity, however requi&s;ite, to be much neg|lected
among&s;t us: And the parliament &s;howed here a
very &s;uperfluous jealou&s;y of the King's &s;trictne&s;s in di&s;|ciplining
<PB N="401" REF="495">
the militia. The principles of liberty rather
require a contrary jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>THE Earl of Bri&s;tol's friend&s;hip with Clarendon,
which had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, with great intimacy, during their
exile and the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the royal party, had been
con&s;iderably impaired &s;ince the re&s;toration, by the Chan|cellor's
refu&s;al of his a&s;&s;ent to &s;ome grants, which
Bri&s;tol had applied for to a court lady: And a little
after, the latter nobleman, agreeable to the impetuo&s;ity
and indi&s;cretion of his temper, broke out again&s;t the
mini&s;ter in the mo&s;t outrageous manner. He even en|tered
a charge of trea&s;on again&s;t him before the Hou&s;e
of Peers; but had concerted his plan &s;o imprudently,
that the judges, when con&s;ulted, declared, that, neither
for its matter nor its form, could it legally be received.
The articles indeed re&s;emble more the incoherent alter|cations
of a pa&s;&s;ionate enemy, than a &s;erious charge, fit
to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed by a court of judicature; and Bri&s;tol
him&s;elf was &s;o a&s;hamed of his conduct and defeat, that
he ab&s;conded during &s;ome time. Notwith&s;tanding his
fine talents, his eloquence, his &s;pirit, and his courage,
he could never regain the character, which he lo&s;t by
this ha&s;ty and precipitant mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT though Clarendon was able to clude this ra&s;h
a&s;&s;ault,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Decline o$ Clarendon's credit.</NOTE> he was &s;en&s;ibly declining in his credit at court;
and in proportion as the King found him&s;elf e&s;tabli&s;hed
on the throne, he began to alienate him&s;elf from a mi|ni&s;ter
who&s;e character was &s;o little &s;uited to his own.
The King's favour for the catholics was always oppo&s;ed
by Clarendon, public liberty was &s;ecured again&s;t all at|tempts
of the over-zealous royali&s;ts, prodigal grants
were checked or refu&s;ed, and the dignity of his own
character was &s;o much con&s;ulted by the Chancellor,
that he made it an inviolable rule, as did al&s;o his friend,
Southampton, never to enter into any connexion with
the royal mi&s;tre&s;&s;es. The King's favourite was Mrs.
<PB N="402" REF="496">
Palmer, afterwards created Dutche&s;s of Cleveland; a
woman prodigal, rapacious, di&s;&s;olute, violent, revenge|ful.
She failed not in her turn to undermine Claren|don's
credit with his ma&s;ter; and her &s;ucce&s;s was at
this time made apparent to the whole world. Secretary
Nicholas, the Chancellor's great friend, was removed
from his place; and Sir Harry Bennet, his avowed
enemy, was advanced to that office. Bennet was &s;oon
after created Lord Arlington.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King's conduct had hitherto, &s;ince his
re&s;toration, been, in the main, laudable, men of pene|tration
began to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e virtues, by which
he had, at fir&s;t, &s;o much dazzled and enchanted the
nation, had great &s;how, but not equal &s;olidity.
His good under&s;tanding lo&s;t much of its influence by
his want of application; his bounty was more the
re&s;ult of a facility of di&s;po&s;ition than of any gene|ro&s;ity
of character; his &s;ocial humour led him frequent|ly
to neglect his dignity; his love of plea&s;ure was not
attended with proper &s;entiment and decency; and while
he &s;eemed to bear a good will to every one that ap|proached
him, he had a heart not very capable of &s;in|cere
friend&s;hip, and he had &s;ecretly entertained a very
bad opinion and dir&s;tu&s;t of mankind. But above all,
what &s;ullied his character in the eyes of good judges
was his negligent ingratitude towards the unfortunate
cavaliers, who&s;e zeal and &s;ufferings for the royal cau&s;e
had known no bounds. This conduct however in the
King may, from the circum&s;tances of his &s;ituation and
temper, admit of &s;ome excu&s;e; at lea&s;t, of &s;ome alle|viation.
As he had been re&s;tored more by the efforts
of his reconciled enemies than of his antient friends,
the former pretended a title to &s;hare his favour; and
being from practice, acquainted with public bu&s;ine&s;s,
they were better qualified to execute any tru&s;t commit|ted
to them. The King's revenues were far from being
<PB N="403" REF="497">
large, or even equal to his nece&s;&s;ary expences; and
his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and the companions of his mirth and plea|&s;ures,
gained by &s;ollicitation every reque&s;t from his
ea&s;y temper. The very poverty, to which the more
zealous royali&s;ts had reduced them&s;elves, by rendering
them in&s;ignificant, made them unfit to &s;upport the
King's mea&s;ures, and cau&s;ed him to regard them as a
u&s;ele&s;s incumbrance. And as many fal&s;e and ridicu|lous
claims of merit were offered, his natural indolence,
aver&s;e to a &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion or enquiry, led him to treat
them all with equal indifference. The parliament took
&s;ome notice of the poor cavaliers. Sixty thou&s;and
pounds were at one time di&s;tributed among them: Mrs.
Lane al&s;o and the Penderells had hand&s;ome pre&s;ents and
pen&s;ions from the King. But the greate&s;t part of the
royali&s;ts &s;till remained in poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; aggra|vated
by the cruel di&s;appointment of their &s;anguine
hopes, and by &s;eeing favour and preferment be&s;towed
upon their mo&s;t inveterate foes. With regard to the
act of indemnity and oblivion, they univer&s;ally &s;aid,
that it was an act of indemnity to the King's enemies,
and of oblivion to his friends.</P>

period of the pre&s;ent reign, did this &s;pirit pa&s;s more
evidently the bounds of rea&s;on and moderation.</P>
<P>THE King in his &s;peech to the parliament had ven|tured
openly to demand a repeal of the triennial act; and
he even went &s;o far as to declare, that, notwith&s;tanding
the law, he never would allow any parliament to be
a&s;&s;embled by the methods pre&s;cribed in that famous &s;ta|tute.
The parliament, without taking offence at this
declaration, repealed the law; and in lieu of all the &s;e|curities,
formerly provided, &s;atisfied them&s;elves with a
general clau&s;e, &startq;that parliaments &s;hould not be in|terrupted
above three years at the mo&s;t.&endq; As the
Engli&s;h parliament had now rai&s;ed it&s;elf to be a regular
<PB N="405" REF="499">
check and controul upon royal power; 'tis evident, that
they ought &s;till to have pre&s;erved a regular &s;ecurity for
their meeting, and not have tru&s;ted entirely to the good|will
of the King, who, if ambitious or enterpri&s;ing, had
&s;o little rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed with the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies. Be|fore
the end of Charles's reign, the nation had occa|&s;ion
to feel very &s;en&s;ibly the bad effects of this repeal.</P>
<P>BY the act of uniformity, every clergyman, who
&s;hould officiate without being properly qualified, was
puni&s;hable by fines and impri&s;onment: But this &s;ecurity
was not thought &s;ufficient for the church. It was now
enacted, that, wherever five per&s;ons above tho&s;e of the
&s;ame hou&s;ehold, &s;hould a&s;&s;emble in a religious congre|gation,
every one of them was liable, for the fir&s;t of|fence,
to be impri&s;oned three months, or pay five
pounds; for the &s;econd, to be impri&s;oned &s;ix months,
or pay ten pounds; and for the third, to be tran&s;ported
&s;even years, or pay one hundred pounds. The parlia|ment
had only in their eye the malignity of the &s;ecta|ries:
They &s;hould have carried their attention farther,
to the cau&s;e of that malignity, the former re&s;traint and
hard&s;hips, which they had undergone.</P>
<P>THE Commons likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed a vote, that the
wrongs, di&s;honours, and indignities, offered to the
Engli&s;h by the &s;ubjects of the United Provinces, were
the greate&s;t ob&s;tructions to all foreign trade: And they
promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King with their lives and fortunes
in a&s;&s;erting the rights of his crown again&s;t all oppo&s;i|tion
what&s;oever. This was the fir&s;t open &s;tep towards
a Dutch war. We mu&s;t explain the cau&s;es and mo|tives
of this mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THAT clo&s;e union and confederacy, which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Hol|land.</NOTE> during a

<PB N="406" REF="500">
intere&s;ts of the&s;e &s;tates, as on their terror of the grow|ing
power of France, who, without their combination
it is apprehended would &s;oon extend her dominion over
Europe. In the fir&s;t years of Charles's reign, when
the ambitious genius of the French monarch had not,
as yet, di&s;played it&s;elf; and when the mighty force of
his people was, in a great mea&s;ure, unknown even to
them&s;elves, the rival&s;hip of commerce, not checked by
any other jealou&s;y or apprehen&s;ion, had naturally in
England begot a violent enmity again&s;t the neighbour|ing
republic.</P>
<P>TRADE was beginning, among the Engli&s;h, to be a
matter of very general concern; but notwith&s;tanding
all their efforts and advantages, their commerce &s;eemed
hitherto to &s;tand upon a footing, which was &s;omewhat
precarious. The Dutch, who, by indu&s;try and fruga|lity,
were enabled to under&s;ell them in every market,
retained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mo&s;t lucrative branches of
commerce; and the Engli&s;h merchants had the morti|fication
to find, that all attempts to extend their trade
were &s;till turned, by the vigilance of their rivals, to
their lo&s;s and di&s;honour. Their indignation increa&s;ed,
when they con&s;idered the &s;uperior naval power of Eng|land,
the bravery of her officers and &s;eamen, her fa|vourable
&s;ituation by which &s;he was enabled to inter|cept
the whole Dutch commerce. By the pro&s;pect of
the&s;e advantages, they were &s;trongly prompted from mo|tives
le&s;s ju&s;t than political, to make war upon the
States; and at once to ravi&s;h from them by force, what
they could not obtain, or could obtain but &s;lowly, by
&s;uperior &s;kill and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>THE carele&s;s, unambitious temper of Charles ren|dered
him little capable of forming &s;o va&s;t a project as
that of engro&s;ing the commerce and naval power of
Europe; yet could he not remain altogether in&s;en&s;ible
<PB N="407" REF="501">
to &s;uch obvious and &s;uch tempting pro&s;pects. His ge|nius,
happily turned towards mechanics, inclined him
to &s;tudy naval affairs, which, next to plea&s;ure, he both
loved the mo&s;t of all things, and under&s;tood the be&s;t.
Though the Dutch, during his exile, had expre&s;&s;ed to|wards
him more civility and friend&s;hip, than he had re|ceived
from any other foreign power; the Louve&s;tein
or ari&s;tocratic faction, which, at this time, ruled the
Commonwealth, had fallen into clo&s;e union with
France; and could that party be &s;ubdued, he might
hope, that his nephew, the young Prince of Orange,
would be re-in&s;tated in the authority, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his
ance&s;tors, and would bring the States to a dependance
under England. His narrow revenues made it &s;till re|qui&s;ite
for him to &s;tudy the humour of his people,
which now ran violently towards war; and it has been
&s;u&s;pected, though the &s;u&s;picion was not ju&s;tified by the
event, that the hopes of diverting &s;ome of the &s;upplies
to his private u&s;e were not overlooked by this nece&s;&s;itous
monarch.</P>
<P>THE Duke of York, more active and enterpri&s;ing,
pu&s;hed more eagerly the war with Holland. He de&s;ired
an opportunity of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf: He loved to
cultivate commerce: He was at the head of a new Afri|can
company, who&s;e trade was extremely checked by
the &s;ettlements of the Dutch: And perhaps, the bigot|ted
prejudices, by which that Prince was always &s;o
much governed, began, even &s;o early, to in&s;til into
him an antipathy again&s;t a prote&s;tant Commonwealth,
the bulwark of the reformation. Clarendon and South|ampton,
ob&s;erving that the nation was not fortified by
any foreign alliance, were aver&s;e to the war; but their
credit was now on the decline.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e concurring motives,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of May</NOTE> the court and parlia|ment
were both of them inclined to a Dutch war. The
parliament was prorogued without voting any &s;upplies:
<PB N="408" REF="502">
But as they had been induced, without any open appli|cation
from the crown, to pa&s;s that vote above-men|tioned
again&s;t the Dutch encroachments, it was rea|&s;onably
con&s;idered as &s;anction &s;ufficient for the vigo|rous
mea&s;ures, which were re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>DOWNING, the Engli&s;h mini&s;ter at the Hague, a man
of an in&s;olent, impetuous temper, pre&s;ented a memorial
to the States, containing a li&s;t of tho&s;e depredations,
which the Engli&s;h complained of. It is remarkable, that
all the pretended depredations preceded the year 1662,
when a treaty of league and alliances had been renewed
with the Dutch; and the&s;e complaints where then
thought, either &s;o unju&s;t or &s;o frivolous, that they had
not been mentioned in that treaty. Two &s;hips alone,
the Bonaventure and the Good-hope, had been claimed
by the Engli&s;h; and it was agreed, that they &s;hould
pro&s;ecute their claim by the ordinary cour&s;e of ju&s;tice.
The States had con&s;igned a &s;um of money, in ca&s;e the
cau&s;e &s;hould be decided again&s;t them; but the matter
was &s;till in dependance. Cary, who was entru&s;ted by
the proprietors with the management of the law&s;uit for
the Bonaventure, had re&s;olved to accept of thirty thou|&s;and
pounds, which were offered him; but was hindered
by Downing, who told him, that the claim was a mat|ter
of &s;tate between the two nations, not a concern of
private per&s;ons<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 42.</NOTE>. The&s;e
circum&s;tances give us no fa|vourable
idea of the ju&s;tice of the Engli&s;h preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>CHARLES confined not him&s;elf to memorials and re|mon&s;trances.
Sir Robert Holmes was &s;ecretly di&s;|patched
with a &s;quadron of twenty-two &s;hips to the
coa&s;t of Africa. He not only expelled the Dutch from
Cape Cor&s;e, to which the Engli&s;h had &s;ome preten|&s;ions:
He likewi&s;e &s;eized the Dutch &s;ettlements of Cape
$word$ and the I&s;le of Gorce, together with &s;everal &s;hips
<PB N="409" REF="503">
trading on that coa&s;t. And having &s;ailed to America,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of Nova Belgia, &s;ince called New
York; a territory, which James the fir&s;t had given by
patent to the Earl of Sterling, but which had never
been planted but by the Hollanders. When the States
complained of the&s;e ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, the King, un|willing
to avow what he could not well ju&s;tify, pre|tended
to be totally ignorant of Holmes's enterprize.
He likewi&s;e con$ined Holmes to the Tower; but &s;ome
time after re&s;tored him to his liberty.</P>
<P>THE Dutch, finding that their applications for redre&s;s
were likely to be cluded, and that a ground of quarrel
was indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought for by the Engli&s;h, began to
arm with diligence. They even exerted, with &s;ome
precipitation, an act of vigor, which ha&s;tened on the
rupture. Sir John Law&s;on and de Ruyter had been &s;ent
with combined &s;quadrons into the Mediterranean, in
order to cha&s;ti&s;e the pyratical States on the coa&s;t of Bar|bary;
and the time of their &s;eparation and return was
now approaching. The States &s;ecretly di&s;patched orders
to de Ruyter, that he &s;hould take in provi&s;ions at Ca|diz;
and &s;ailing towards the coa&s;t of Guinea, &s;hould
retaliate on the Engli&s;h, and put the Dutch in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of tho&s;e &s;ettlements whence Holmes had expelled them.
De Ruyter, having a con&s;iderable force on board, met
with no oppo&s;ition in Guinea. All the new acqui&s;i|tions
of the Engli&s;h, except Cape Cor&s;e, were recover|ed
from them. They were even di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome old
&s;ettlements. Such of their &s;hips as fell into his hands
were &s;eized by de Ruyter. That Admiral &s;ailed next to
America. He attacked Barbadoes, but was repul&s;ed.
He afterwards committed ho&s;tilities on Long I&s;land.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Engli&s;h preparations for war were
advancing with vigor and indu&s;try. The King had re|ceived
no &s;upplies from parliament; but by his own
<PB N="410" REF="504">
funds and credit he was enabled to equip a fleet: the
city of London lent him 100,000 pounds: the &s;pirit of
the nation &s;econded his armaments: he him&s;elf went
from port to port, in&s;pecting with great diligence, and
encouraging the work: and in a little time the Engli&s;h
navy was put in a very formidable condition. Eight
hundred thou&s;and pounds are &s;aid to have been expend|ed
on this armament. When Law&s;on arrived, and
communicated his &s;u&s;picion of de Ruyter's enterpri&s;e,
orders were i&s;&s;ued for &s;eizing all Dutch &s;hips; and 135
fell into the hands of the Engli&s;h. The&s;e were not
confi&s;cated, nor declared prizes, till afterwards, when
war was proclaimed.</P>
<P>THE parliament, when met, granted a &s;upply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of No|vember. A new &s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> the
large&s;t by far that had ever been given to a King of
England, but no more than &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent
undertaking. Near two millions and a half were voted,
to be levied by quarterly payments in three years. The
avidity of the merchants, together with the great pro&s;|pect
of &s;ucce&s;s, had animated the whole nation again&s;t
the Dutch.</P>
<P>A GREAT alteration was made this &s;e&s;&s;ion in the me|thod
of taxing the clergy. In almo&s;t all the other mo|narchies
of Europe, the a&s;&s;emblies, who&s;e con&s;ent was
formerly requi&s;ite to the enacting of laws, were com|po&s;ed
of three e&s;tates, the clergy, the nobility, and the
commonalty, which formed &s;o many members of the
political body, of which the King was con&s;idered as the
head. In England too, the parliament was always re|pre&s;ented
as con&s;i&s;ting of three e&s;tates; but their &s;epa|ration
was never &s;o di&s;tinct as in other kingdoms. A
convocation, however, had u&s;ually &s;at at the &s;ame time
with the parliament: though they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no a nega|tive
voice in the pa&s;&s;ing of laws, and a&s;&s;umed no farther
power than that of impo&s;ing taxes on the clergy. By
<PB N="411" REF="505">
rea&s;on of eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, which he could be|&s;tow,
the King's influence over the church was more
con&s;iderable than over the laity; &s;o that the &s;ub&s;idies
granted by the convocation, were commonly greater
than tho&s;e voted by the parliament. The church, there|fore,
was not di&s;plea&s;ed to depart tacitly from the right
of taxing her&s;elf, and allow the Commons to lay impo|&s;itions
on eccle&s;ia&s;tical revenues, as on the re&s;t of the
kingdom. In recompence, two &s;ub&s;idies, which the
convocation had formerly granted, were remitted, and
$word$ parochial clergy were allowed to vote at elections.
Thus the church of England made a barter of power
for profit. Their convocations, having become u&s;ele&s;s
to the crown, have been very much di$u&s;ed of late
years.</P>
<P>THE Dutch &s;aw, with the utmo&s;t regret, a war ap|proaching,
whence they might dread the mo&s;t fatal con|&s;equences,
but which a&s;&s;orded no pro&s;pect of advantage.
They tried every art of negotiation, before they would
come to extremity. Their mea&s;ures were at that time
directed by John de Wit, a mini&s;ter equally eminent for
greatne&s;s of mind, for capacity, and for integrity. Tho'
moderate in his private deportment, he knew how to
adopt in his public councils that magnanimity, which
&s;uits the mini&s;ter of a great &s;tate. It was ever his
maxim, that no independant government &s;hould yield
to another any evident point of rea&s;on or equity; and
that all &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, &s;o far from preventing war,
&s;erved to no other purpo&s;e than to provoke fre&s;h claims
and in&s;olencies. By his management a &s;pirit of union
was pre&s;erved in all the provinces; great &s;ums were le|vied;
and a navy was equipped, compo&s;ed of larger
&s;hips than the Dutch had ever built before, and able to
cope with the fleet of England.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="506">
As &s;oon as certain intelligence arrived of de Ruyter's
enterprizes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1665.</NOTE> Charles declared war again&s;t the States.
His fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of 114 &s;ail, be&s;ides fire-&s;hips and
ketches, was commanded by the Duke of York,<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> and
under him by Prince Rupert and the Earl of Sandwich.
It had about 22,000 men on board. Obdam, who was
admiral of the Dutch navy, of nearly equal force,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of June. Victory of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> de|clined
not the combat. In the heat of action, when
engaged in clo&s;e fight with the Duke of York, Ob|dam's
&s;hip blew up. This accident much di&s;couraged
the Dutch, who fled towards their own coa&s;t. Tromp
alone, &s;on of the famous admiral, killed during the Pro|tector&s;hip,
bravely &s;u&s;tained with his &s;quadron the ef|forts
of the Engli&s;h, and protected the rear of his coun|trymen.
The vanqui&s;hed had nineteen &s;hips &s;unk and
taken. The victors lo&s;t only one. Sir John Law&s;on
died &s;oon after of his wounds.</P>
<P>IT is affirmed, and with great appearance of rea&s;on,
that this victory might have been rendered much more
compleat, had not orders been i&s;&s;ued to &s;lacken &s;ail by
Brounker, one of the Duke's bedchamber, who pre|tended
authority from his ma&s;ter. The Duke di&s;claimed
the orders; but Brounker never was &s;ufficiently pu|ni&s;hed
for his temerity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Burnet &s;ufficiently accounts for Brounker's impunity, by informing us, that he was a favourite of the Dutche&s;s of Cleveland, the King's favourite mi&s;treis.</NOTE>. It is allowed, however, that
the Duke behaved with great bravery during the action.
He was long in the thicke&s;t of the fire. The Earl of
Falmouth, Lord Mu&s;kerry, and Mr. Boyle, were killed
by one &s;hot at his &s;ide, and covered him all over with
their brains and gore. And it is not likely, that in a
pur&s;uit, where even per&s;ons of inferior &s;tation, and of
the mo&s;t cowardly di&s;po&s;ition, acquire courage, a com|mander
&s;hould feel his &s;pirits to flag, and &s;hould turn
<PB N="13" REF="507">
from the back of an enemy, who&s;e face he had not
been afraid to encounter.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;a&s;ter threw the Dutch into con&s;ternation,
and determined de Wit, who was the &s;oul of all their
councils, to exert his military capacity, in order to &s;up|port
the declining courage of his countrymen. He went
on board the fleet, which he took under his command;
and he &s;oon remedied all tho&s;e di&s;orders which had been
occa&s;ioned by the late misfortune. The genius of this
man was of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive nature. He quickly be|came
as much ma&s;ter of naval affairs, as if he had from
his infancy been educated in them; and he even im|proved
&s;ome parts of pilotage and &s;ailing, beyond what
men expert in tho&s;e arts had ever been able to attain.</P>
<P>THE mi&s;fortunes of the Dutch determined their al|lies
to act for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport. The King
of France was engaged in a defen&s;ive alliance with the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with France.</NOTE>
States; but as his naval force was yet in its infancy, he
was extremely aver&s;e, at that time, from entering into a
war with &s;o formidable a power as England. He tried
long to mediate a peace between the two parties, and
for that purpo&s;e &s;ent an emba&s;&s;y to London, which re|turned
without effecting any thing. Lord Hollis, the
Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador at Paris, endeavoured to draw over
Lewis to the &s;ide of England; and, in his ma&s;ter's
name, made him the mo&s;t tempting offers. Charles
was content to abandon all the Spani&s;h Low Coun|tries
to the French, without pretending to a foot of
ground for him&s;elf; provided Lewis would allow him
to pur&s;ue his advantages again&s;t the Dutch<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">D'E&s;trades, 19th of December, 1664.</NOTE>. But the
French Monarch, though the conque&s;t of that valuable
territory was the chief object of his ambition, rejected
the offer as contrary to his inter&s;t: he thought, that if
the Engli&s;h had once e&s;tabli&s;hed an uncontroulable do|minion
<PB N="414" REF="508">
over the &s;ea and over commerce, they would
&s;oon be able to render his acqui&s;itions a very dear pur|cha&s;e
to him. When de Lionne, the French &s;ecretary,
a&s;&s;ured Van Buninghen, Amba&s;&s;ador of the States, that
this offer had been pre&s;&s;ed on his ma&s;ter during &s;ix
months, &startq;I can readily believe it,&endq; replied the Dutch|man;
&startq;I am &s;en&s;ible that it is the intere&s;t of Eng|land<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Id. 14th of Augu&s;t, 1665.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>SUCH were the e&s;tabli&s;hed maxims at that time with
regard to the intere&s;ts of Princes. It mu&s;t however be
allowed, that the politics of Charles in making this of|fer,
were not a little hazardous. The extreme weak|ne&s;s
of Spain would have rendered the French conque&s;ts
ea&s;y and infallible: but the vigour of the Dutch, it
might be fore&s;een, would make the &s;ucce&s;s of the Eng|li&s;h
much more precarious. And even were the naval
force of Holland totally annihilated, the acqui&s;ition of the
Dutch commerce to England could not be relied on as
a certain con&s;equence; nor is trade a con&s;tant attendant
of power, but depends on many other, and &s;ome of
them very delicate, circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THO' the King of France was re&s;olved to &s;upport the
Hollanders in that unequal conte&s;t, in which they were
engaged; he yet protracted his declaration, and em|ployed
the time in naval preparations, both in the ocean
and the Mediterranean. The King of Denmark mean
while was re&s;olved not to remain an idle &s;pectator of
the conte&s;t between the maritime powers. The part
which he acted was the mo&s;t extraordinary: he made a
&s;ecret agreement with Charles to &s;eize all the Dutch
&s;hips in his harbours, and to &s;hare the &s;poils with the
Engli&s;h, provided they would a&s;&s;i&s;t him in executing
this mea&s;ure. In order to increa&s;e his prey, he perfi|diou&s;ly
invited the Dutch &s;hips to take &s;helter in his
<PB N="415" REF="509">
ports; and accordingly the Ea&s;t India fleet, very richly
laden, had put into Bergen. Sandwich, who now coun|manded
the Engli&s;h navy (the Duke having gone a&s;hore)
di&s;patched Sir Thomas Tiddiman with a &s;quadron to
attack them; but whether from the King of Den|mark's
delay in &s;ending orders to the Governor, or,
what is more probable, from his avidity in endeavour|ing
to engro&s;s the whole booty, the Engli&s;h admiral,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE>
tho' he behaved with great bravery, failed of his pur|po&s;e.
The Dani&s;h governor fired upon him; and the
Dutch, having had lei&s;ure to fortify them&s;elves, made a
very gallant re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE King of Denmark, &s;eemingly a&s;hamed of his
conduct, concluded with Sir Gilbert Talbot, the Eng|li&s;h
envoy, an offen&s;ive alliance agan&s;t the States;
and at the very &s;ame time, his re&s;ident at the Hague,
by his orders, concluded an offen&s;ive alliance again&s;t
England. To this la&s;t alliance he adhered, probably
from jealou&s;y of the encrea&s;ing naval power of England;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rupture with Den|mark.</NOTE>
and he &s;eized and confi&s;cated all the Engli&s;h &s;hips in
his harbours. This was a very &s;en&s;ible check to the
advantages which Charles had obtained over the Dutch.
Not only a great blow was given to the Engli&s;h com|merce:
the King of Denmark's naval force was al&s;o
con&s;iderable, and threatened every moment a conjunc|tion
with the Hollanders. That Prince &s;tipulated to
a&s;&s;i&s;t his allies with a fleet of thirty &s;ail; and he re|ceived
in return a yearly &s;ub&s;idy of 1,500,000 crowns,
of which 300,000 were paid by France.</P>
<P>THE King endeavoured to counterbalance the&s;e con|federacies
by acqui$ing new friends and allies. He had
di&s;patched Sir Richard Fan&s;haw into Spain, who met
with a very cold reception. That monarchy was &s;unk
into a great degree of weakne&s;s, and was menaced with
an inva&s;ion from France; yet could not any motive
<PB N="416" REF="510">
prevail with Philip to enter into a cordial friend&s;hip
with England. Charles's alliance with Portugal, the
detention of Jamaica and Tangiers, the &s;ale of Dun|kirk,
to the French; all the&s;e offences &s;unk &s;o deep in|to
the mind of the Spani&s;h monarch, that no motive of
intere&s;t was &s;ufficient to outweigh them.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter was the only ally that Charles
could acquire. That prelate, a man of re&s;tle&s;s enter|prize
and ambition, had entertained a violent animo&s;ity
again&s;t the States; and he was ea&s;ily engaged, by the
promi&s;e of &s;ub&s;idies from England, to make an incur|&s;ion
on that republic. With a tumultuary army of
near 20,000 men, he invaded her territories, and met
with weak re&s;i&s;tance. The land forces of the States
were as &s;eeble and ill-governed, as their fleets were
gallant and formidable. But after committing great ra|vages
in &s;everal of the provinces, a &s;top was put to the
progre&s;s of this warlike prelate. He had not military
&s;kill &s;ufficient to improve the advantages which fortune
had offered him. The King of France &s;ent a body of
6000 men to oppo&s;e him: &s;ub&s;idies were not regularly
remitted to him from England; and many of his troops
de&s;erted for want of pay: the Elector of Brandenburgh
threatened him with an inva&s;ion in his own &s;tate: and
on the whole, he was glad to conclude a peace under
the mediation of France. On the fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;e of his
intentions, Sir William Temple was &s;ent from London
with money to fix him in his former alliance; but
found, that he arrived too late.</P>
<P>THE Dutch, encouraged by all the&s;e favourable cir|cum&s;tances,
continued re&s;olute to exert them&s;elves to
the utmo&s;t in their own defence. De Ruyter, their
great admiral, was arrived from his expedition to G$i|nea:
Their India fleet was come home in safety: Th$$
harbours were crowded with merchant &s;hips: Faction
<PB N="417" REF="511">
at home was appea&s;ed: The young Prince of Orange
bad put him&s;elf under the tuition of the States of Hol|land,
and of de Wit, their pen&s;ionary, who executed his
tru&s;t with great honour and fidelity: And the animo|&s;ity,
which the Hollanders entertained again&s;t the at|tack
of the English, &s;o unprovoked, as they thought it,
made them thir&s;t for revenge, and hope for better &s;uc|cess
in their next enterprize. Such vigour was exerted

the fleet, all merchant &s;hips were prohibited to &s;ail, and
even the fi&s;heries were totally &s;u&s;pended<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Tromp's life. D'E&s;trades, 5th of February, 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h likewi&s;e continued in the &s;ame di&s;po&s;i|tion,
though another more grievous calamity had joined
it&s;elf to that of war. The plague had broke out in
London; and that with &s;uch violence as to cut off, in
le&s;s than a year, near 100,000 inhabitants.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> The King
was obliged to &s;ummon the parliament at Oxford.</P>
<P>THE good agreement &s;till continued between the<NOTE PLACE="marg">New &s;e&s;&s;ion.</NOTE>
King and the parliament. They, on their part, unani|mou&s;ly
voted him the &s;upply demanded, twelve hundred
and fifty thou&s;and pounds, to be levied in two years by
monthly a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. And he, to gratify them, pa&s;&s;ed
the famous five-mile-act,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Five-mile|act.</NOTE> which has given occa&s;ion to
&s;uch grievous and &s;uch ju&s;t complaints. The church,
under pretence of guarding monarchy again&s;t its inve|terate
enemies, per&s;evered in the project of wracking its
own enmity again&s;t the nonconformi&s;ts. It was enact|ed,
that no di&s;&s;enting teacher, who took not the non|re&s;i&s;tance
oath above-mentioned, &s;hould, except upon
the road, come within five miles of any corporation, or
of any place, where he had preached after the act of
oblivion. The penalty was a fine of fifty pounds, and
&s;ix months impri&s;onment. By ejecting the noncon|formi&s;t
mini&s;ters from their churches, and prohibiting
<PB N="418" REF="512">
all &s;eparate congregations, they had been rendered inca|pable
of gaining any livelihood by their &s;piritual pro|fe&s;&s;ion.
And now, under colour of removing them from
places, where their influence might be dangerous, an
expedient was fallen upon to deprive them of all means
of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Had not the &s;pirit of the nation under|gone
a change, the&s;e violences were preludes to the mo&s;t
furious per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>HOWEVER prevalent the hierarchy, this law did not
pa&s;s without oppo&s;ition. Be&s;ides &s;everal peers, attached
to the old parliamentary party, Southampton him&s;elf,
though Clarendon's great friend, expre&s;&s;ed his di&s;ap|probation
of the&s;e mea&s;ures. But the church party, not
di&s;couraged with this oppo&s;ition, introduced into the
Hou&s;e of Commons a bill for impo&s;ing the oath of non|re&s;i&s;tance
on the whole nation. It was rejected only
by three voices. The parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">31&s;t of Octo|ber.</NOTE> after a very &s;hort
&s;e&s;&s;ion, was prorogued.</P>
<P>AFTER France had declared war,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1666.</NOTE> England was evi|dently
over-matched in &s;orce. Yet &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this
advantage by her &s;ituation, that &s;he lay between the
fleets of her enemies, and might be able, by &s;peedy and
well-concerted operations, to prevent their conjunction.
But &s;uch was the unhappy conduct of her commanders,
or &s;uch the want of intelligence in her mini&s;ters,
that this circum&s;tance turned rather to her prejudice.
Lewis had given orders to the Duke of Beaufort, his
admiral, to &s;ail from Toulon; and the French &s;qua|dron,
under his command, con&s;i&s;ting of above forty
&s;ail<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">D' E&s;trades, 21&s;t of May, 1666.</NOTE>, was now commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be entering the
channel. The Dutch fleet, to the number of &s;eventy-&s;ix
&s;ail, was at &s;ea, under the command of de Ruyte$
and Tromp, in order to join him. The Duke of Al|bemarle
and Prince Rupert commanded the Engli&s;h
<PB N="419" REF="513">
fleet, which exceeded not &s;eventy-four &s;ail. Albemarle,
who, from his &s;ucce&s;&s;es under the Protector&s;hip, had
too much learned to de&s;pi&s;e the enemy, propo&s;ed to de|tach
Prince Rupert with twenty &s;hips, in order to op|po&s;e
the Duke of Beaufort. Sir George Ay&s;cue, well
acquainted with the bravery and conduct of de Ruyter,
prote&s;ted again&s;t the temerity of this re&s;olution: But
Albemarle's authority prevailed. The remainder of the
Engli&s;h &s;et &s;ail to give battle to the Dutch; who, &s;ee|ing
the enemy advance quickly upon them, cut their
cables, and prepared for the combat. The battle,
which en&s;ued, is one of the mo&s;t memorable, which we
read of in &s;tory; whether we con&s;ider its duration, or
the de&s;perate courage, with which it was fought.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sea fight of four days.</NOTE> Al|bemarle
made here &s;ome atonement by his valour for the
ra&s;hne&s;s of the attempt. No youth, animated by glory and
ambitious hopes, could exert him&s;elf more than did this
man, who was now in the decline of life, and who had
reached the &s;ummit of honours. We &s;hall not enter
minutely into particulars. It will be &s;ufficient to men|tion
the chief events of each day's engagement.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t day, Sir William Berkeley,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of June.</NOTE>, Vice-Admi|ral,
leading the van, fell into the thicke&s;t of the ene|my,
was over-powered, and his &s;hip taken. He him|&s;elf
was found dead in his cabbin, all covered with
blood. The Engli&s;h had the weather-gage of the ene|my;
but as the wind blew &s;o high, that they could not
u&s;e their lower tire, they received &s;mall advantage from
this circum&s;tance. The Dutch &s;hot however, fell
chiefly on their &s;ails and rigging; and few &s;hips were
&s;unk or much damaged. Chain-&s;hot, was at that time
a new invention; which is commonly attributed to de
Wit. Sir John Harman exerted him&s;elf extremely this
day. The Dutch Admiral, Evertz, was killed in en|gaging
him. Darkne&s;s parted the combatants.</P>
<P><PB N="420" REF="514">
THE &s;econd day, the wind was &s;omewhat fallen, and
the combat became more $leddy and more terrible. The
Engli&s;h now found, that the mo&s;t heroic valour cannot
compen&s;ate the &s;uperiority of numbers, again&s;t an ene|my
who is well conducted, and who is not defective in
courage. De Ruyter and Van Tromp, rivals in glory
and enemies from faction, exerted them&s;elves in emula|tion
of each other; and de Ruyter had the advantage
of di&s;engaging and &s;aving his antagoni&s;t who had been
&s;urrounded by the Engli&s;h, and was in the mo&s;t immi|nent
danger. Sixteen fre&s;h &s;hips joined the Dutch
fleet during the action: And the Engli&s;h were &s;o &s;hat|tered,
that, their &s;ighting &s;hips were reduced to twenty-eight,
and they found them&s;elves obliged to retreat to|words
their own coa&s;t. The Dutch followed them,
and were ju&s;t on the point of renewing the combat;
when a calm, which came a little before night, pre|vented
the engagement.</P>
<P>NEXT morning, the Engli&s;h were nece&s;&s;itated to con|tinue
their retreat; and a proper di&s;po&s;ition was made
for that purpo&s;e. The &s;hattered &s;hips were ordered to
&s;tretch a-head; and &s;ixteen of the mo&s;t entire followed
them in good order, and kept the enemy in awe. Al|bemarle
him&s;lef clo&s;ed the rear, and pre&s;ented an un|daunted
countenance to his victorious foes. The Earl
of O&s;&s;ory, &s;on to Ormond, a gallant youth, who
&s;ought honour and danger in every action throughout
Europe, was then on board the Admiral. Albemarle
confe&s;&s;ed to him his intention rather to blow up his
&s;hip and peri&s;h gloriou&s;ly, than yield to the enemy.
O&s;&s;ory applauded this de&s;perate re&s;olution.</P>
<P>ABOUT two o'clock, the Dutch had come up with
their enemy, and were ready to renew the fight; when
a new fleet was de&s;cried from the &s;outh, crowding all
their &s;ails to reach the &s;cene of action. The Dutch
flattered them&s;elves that Beaufort was arrived, to cut off
<PB N="421" REF="515">
the retreat of the vanqui&s;hed: The Engli&s;h hoped,
that Prince Rupert had come, to turn the &s;cale of ac|tion.
Albemarle, who had received intelligence of the
Prince's approach, bent his cour&s;e towards him. Un|happily,
Sir George Ay&s;cue, in a &s;hip of a hundred
guns, the large&s;t in the fleet, &s;truck on the Galloper
&s;ands, and could receive no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his friends,
who were ha&s;tening to join the reinforcement. He
could not even reap the con&s;olation of peri&s;hing glori|ou&s;ly,
and revenging his death on his enemies. They
were preparing fire&s;hips to attack him, and he was
obliged to &s;trike. The Engli&s;h &s;ailors, &s;eeing the ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
with the utmo&s;t indignation &s;urrendered them|&s;elves
pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>ALBEMARLE and Prince Rupert were now determin|ed
to face the enemy; and next morning, the battle
began afre&s;h, with more equal &s;orce than ever, and with
equal valour. After long cannonading, the fleets came
to a more clo&s;e combat; which was continued with
great violence, till parted by a mi&s;t. The Engli&s;h re|tired
fir&s;t into their harbours.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Engli&s;h, by their ob&s;tinate courage,
reaped the chief honour in this engagement, it is &s;ome|what
uncertain, who obtained the victory. The Hol|landers
took a few &s;hips; and having &s;ome appearances
of advantage, expre&s;&s;ed their &s;atisfaction by all the &s;igns
of triumph and rejoicing. But as the Engli&s;h fleet was
repaired in a little time, and put to &s;ee more formidable
than ever, together with many of tho&s;e &s;hips, which
the Dutch had boa&s;ted to have burned or de&s;troyed;
all Europe &s;aw that tho&s;e two brave nations were en|gaged
in a conte&s;t, which was not likely, on either
&s;ide, to prove deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>IT was the conjunction of the French alone, which
could give the &s;uperiority to the Dutch. In order to
facilitate this conjunction, de Ruyter, having repaired
<PB N="422" REF="516">
the fleet, po&s;ted him&s;elf at the mouth of the Thames.
The Engli&s;h under Prince Rupert and Albemarle were
not long in coming to the attack.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of July. Victory of the Engli&s;h.</NOTE> The numbers of
each fleet amounted to about eighty &s;ail; and the valour
and experience of the commanders, as well as of the
&s;eamen, rendered the engagement &s;ierce and ob&s;tinate.
Sir Thomas Allen, who commanded the white &s;qua|dron
of the Engli&s;h, attacked the Dutch van, whom he
entirely routed; and he killed the three Admirals who
commanded it. Van Tromp engaged Sir Jeremy
Smith; and during the heat of action, he was &s;eparated
from de Ruyter and the main body, whether by acci|dent
or de&s;ign was never certainly known. De Ruyter,
with great conduct and valour, maintained the combat
again&s;t the main body of the Engli&s;h; and though over|powered
by numbers, kept his &s;tation, till night ended
the engagement. Next day, finding the Dutch fleet
&s;cattered and di&s;couraged, his high &s;pirit was obliged to
&s;ubmit to a retreat, which yet he conducted with &s;uch
&s;kill, as to render it equally honourable to him&s;elf as
the greate&s;t victory. Full of indignation however for
yielding the &s;uperiority to the enemy, he frequently ex|claimed,
&startq;My God! what a wretch am I? among &s;o
&startq;many thou&s;and bullets, is there not one to put an end
to my mi&s;erable life?&endq; One de Witte, his &s;on-in-law,
who &s;tood near, exhorted him, &s;ince he &s;ought
death, to turn upon the Engli&s;h, and render his life a
dear purcha&s;e to the victors. But de Ruyter e&s;teemed
it more worthy a brave man to per&s;evere to the uttermo&s;t,
and, as long as po&s;&s;ible, to render &s;ervice to his coun|try.
All that night and next day, the Engli&s;h pre&s;&s;ed
upon the rear of the Dutch; and it was chiefly by the
redoubled efforts of de Ruyter, that the latter &s;aved
them&s;elves in their harbours.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of the Hollanders in this action was not
very con&s;iderable; but as violent animo&s;ities had broke
<PB N="423" REF="517">
out between the two Admirals, who engaged all the
officers on one &s;ide or other, the con&s;ternation, which
took place, was very great among the provinces.
Tromp's commi&s;&s;ion was at la&s;t taken from him; but
though &s;everal Captains had mi&s;behaved, they were &s;o
well protected by their friends in the magi&s;tracy of the
towns, that mo&s;t of them e&s;caped puni&s;hment, many
were &s;till continued in their commands.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h now rode inconte&s;tible ma&s;ters of the
&s;ea, and in&s;ulted the Dutch in their harbours. A de|tachment
under Holmes was &s;ent into the road of Vlie,
and burned a hundred and forty merchantmen, two men
of war, together with Brandaris, a large and rich vil|lage
on the coa&s;t. The merchants, who lo&s;t by this
enterprize, uniting them&s;elves to the Orange faction,
exclaimed again&s;t an admini&s;tration, which, they pre|tended,
had brought &s;uch di&s;gracce and ruin on their
country. None but the firm and intrepid mind of de
Wit could have &s;upported it&s;elf under &s;uch a complica|tion
of calamities.</P>
<P>THE King of France, apprehen&s;ive that the Dutch
would &s;ink under their misfortunes; at lea&s;, that de
Wit, his friend, might be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the admini|&s;tration,
ha&s;tened the advance of the Duke of Beau|fort.
The Dutch fleet likewi&s;e was again equip|ped;
and under the command of de Ruyter, crui&s;ed
near the Straits of Dover. Prince Rupert with the
Engli&s;h navy, now &s;tronger than ever, came full &s;ail
upon them. The Dutch Admiral thought proper to
decline the combat, and retired into St. John's Road
near Bulloigne. Here he &s;heltered him&s;elf, both from
the Engli&s;h, and from a furious &s;torm, which aro&s;e.
Prince Rupert too was obliged to retire into St. Helens;
where he &s;tayed &s;ome time, in order to repair the dam|ages,
which he had &s;u&s;tained. Mean while the Duke
<PB N="424" REF="518">
of Beaufort proceeded up the channel, and pa&s;&s;ed the
Engli&s;h fleet unperceived; but he did not find the
Dutch, as he expected. De Ruyter had been &s;eized with
a fever: Many of the chief officers had fallen into &s;ick|ne&s;s:
A contagious di&s;temper was &s;pread through the
whole fleet: And the States thought it nece&s;&s;ary to recal
them into their harbours, before the enemy &s;hould be
refited. The French King, anxious for his navy,
which, with &s;o much care and indu&s;try, he had lately
built, di&s;patched orders to Beaufort, to make the be&s;t of
his way to Bre&s;t. That Admiral had again the good for|tune
to pa&s;s the Engli&s;h. One &s;hip alone, the Ruby,
fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>
<P>WHILE the war continued without any deci&s;ive &s;uc|ce&s;s
on either &s;ide,<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of Sep|tember. Fire of Lon|don.</NOTE> a dreadful calamity happened in
London, which threw the people into great con&s;terna|tion.
A fire, breaking out in a baker's hou&s;e near the
bridge, &s;pread it&s;elf on all &s;ides with &s;uch rapidity, that
no efforts could extingui&s;h it, till it laid in a&s;hes a con|&s;iderable
part of the city. The inhabitants, without be|ing
able to do any thing effectual for their relief, were
reduced to be &s;pectators of their own ruin; and were
pur&s;ued from &s;treet to &s;treet by the flames, which un|expectedly
gathered round them. Three days and nights
did the fire advance; and it was only by the blowing up
of hou&s;es, that it was at la&s;t extingui&s;hed. The King
and Duke u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;top the pro|gre&s;s
of the flames; but all their indu&s;try was un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.
About four hundred &s;treets, and thirteen thou|&s;and
hou&s;es were reduced to a&s;hes.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of this calamity were evident. The nar|row
&s;treets of London, the hou&s;es built intirely of wood,
the dry &s;ea&s;on, and a violent ca&s;t wind which blew;
the&s;e were &s;o many concurring circum&s;tances, which
rendered it ea&s;y to a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of the de&s;truction
<PB N="425" REF="519">
that en&s;ued. But the people were not &s;atisfied with this
obvious account. Prompted by blind rage, &s;ome a&s;cribed
the guilt to the republicans, others to the catholics;
though it is not ea&s;y to conceive how the burning of
London could &s;erve the purpo&s;es of either party. As
the papi&s;ts were the chief objects of public dete&s;tation,
the rumour, which threw the guilt on them, was more
favourably received by the people. No proof however,
or even pre&s;umption, after the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry by a
committee of parliament, ever appeared to authorize
&s;uch a calumny; yet in order to give countenance to
the popular prejudice, the in&s;cription, engraved by au|thority
on the monument, a&s;cribed this calamity to that
hated &s;ect. This clau&s;e was erazed by order of King
James, when he came to the throne; but after the re|volution
it was replaced. So credulous, as well as ob|&s;tinate,
are the people, in believing every thing, which
&s;latters their prevailing pa&s;&s;ion!</P>
<P>THE fire of London, though at that time a great ca|lamity,
has proved in the i&s;&s;ue beneficial both to the
city and the kingdom. The city was rebuilt in a very
little time; and care was taken to make the &s;treets
wider and more regular than before. A di&s;cretionary
power was a&s;&s;umed by the King to regulate the di&s;tri|bution
of the buildings, and to forbid the u&s;e of lath
and timber, the materials, of which the hou&s;es were
formerly compo&s;ed. The nece&s;&s;ity was &s;o urgent, and
the occa&s;ion &s;o extraordinary, that no exceptions were
made to an exerci&s;e of authority, which otherwi&s;e
might have been e&s;teemed illegal. Had the King been
enabled to carry his power &s;till farther, and made the
hou&s;es be rebuilt with perfect regularity, and entirely
upon one plan; he had much contributed to the con|venience,
as well as embelli&s;hment of the city. Great
advantages, however, have re&s;ulted from the alterations;
<PB N="426" REF="520">
though not carried to the full length. London became
much more healthy after the fire. The plague, which
u&s;ed to break out with great fury twice or thrice every
century, and indeed was always lurking in &s;ome corner
or other of the city, has not once di&s;covered it&s;elf &s;ince
that calamity.</P>
<P>THE parliament met &s;oon after, and gave the &s;anction
of law to tho&s;e regulations made by royal authority; as
well as appointed commi&s;&s;ioners for deciding all &s;uch
que&s;tions of property, as might ari&s;e from the fire. They
likewi&s;e voted a &s;upply of 1,800,000 pounds to be le|vied,
partly by a poll-bill, partly by a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. Tho'
their enquiry brought out no proofs, which could fix on
the papi&s;ts the burning of London, the general aver&s;ion
again&s;t that &s;ect &s;till prevailed; and complaints were
made, probably without much &s;oundation, of its dan|gerous
increa&s;e. Charles, at the de&s;ire of the Com|mons,
i&s;&s;ued a proclamation for the bani&s;hment of all
prie&s;ts and je&s;uits; but the bad execution of this, as
well as of former edicts, de&s;troyed all confidence in his
&s;incerity, whenever he pretended an aver&s;ion towards
the catholic religion. Whether &s;u&s;picions of this na|ture
had dimini&s;hed the King's popularity, is uncertain;
but it appears,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1667.</NOTE> that the &s;upply was voted much later
than Charles expected, or even than the public nece&s;&s;i|ties
&s;eemed to require. The intrigues of the Duke of
Buckingham, a man who wanted only &s;teadine&s;s to ren|der
him extremely dangerous, had &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;|ed
the mea&s;ures of the court: And this was the fir&s;t
time that the King found any con&s;iderable rea&s;on to
complain of a failure of confidence in this Hou&s;e of
Commons. The ri&s;ing &s;ymptoms of ill humour tended,
no doubt, to quicken the &s;teps, which were already
making towards a peace with foreign enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="427" REF="521">
CHARLES began to be &s;en&s;ible, that all the ends, for
which the war had been undertaken, were likely to
prove entirely ineffectual.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances towards peace.</NOTE> The Dutch, even when
alone, had defended them&s;elves with great vigor, and
were every day improving in their military &s;kill and pre|parations.
Though their trade had &s;uffered extremely,
their exten&s;ive credit enabled them to levy prodigious
&s;ums; and while the &s;eamen of England loudly com|plained
of want of pay, the Dutch navy was regularly
&s;upplied with every thing requi&s;ite for its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
As two powerful Kings now &s;upported them, every
place, from the extremity of Norway to the coa&s;ts of
Bayonne, was become ho&s;tile to the Engli&s;h. And
Charles, neither fond of action, nor &s;timulated by any
violent ambition, gladly &s;ought for means of re&s;toring
tranquillity to his people, heartily di&s;gu&s;ted with a war,
which, being joined with the plague and fire, had
proved &s;o fruitle&s;s and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t advances towards an accommodation were
made by England. When the King &s;ent for the body
of Sir William Berkeley, he in&s;inuated to the States his
de&s;ire of peace on rea&s;onable terms; and their an&s;wer
corre&s;ponded in the &s;ame amicable intentions. Charles,
however, to maintain the appearance of &s;uperiority, &s;till
in&s;i&s;ted, that the States &s;hould treat at London; and
they agreed to make him this compliment &s;o far as con|cerned
them&s;elves: But being engaged in alliance with
two crowned heads, they could not, they &s;aid, prevail with
the&s;e to depart in that re&s;pect from their dignity. On a
&s;udden, the King went &s;o far on the other &s;ide as to of|fer
the &s;ending Amba&s;&s;adors to the Hague; but this
propo&s;al, which &s;eemed honourable to the Dutch, was
meant only to divide and di&s;tract them, by affording the
English an opportunity to carry on cabals with the di&s;|affected
party. The offer was therefore rejected; and
conferences were &s;ecretly held in the Queen mother's
<PB N="428" REF="522">
apartments at Paris, where the preten&s;ions of both par|ties
were di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. The Dutch made very equitable
propo&s;als; either that all things &s;hould be re&s;tored to
the &s;ame condition in which they &s;tood before the war;
or that both parties &s;hould continue in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their
pre&s;ent acqui&s;itions. Charles accepted the latter propo|&s;al;
and almo&s;t every thing was adju&s;ted, except the
di&s;putes with regard to the i&s;le of Polerone. This
i&s;land lies in the Ea&s;t Indies, and was formerly valuable
for its product of &s;pices. The Engli&s;h had been ma&s;|ters
of it; but were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the time when the
violences had been committed again&s;t them at Amboyna.
Cromwel had &s;tipulated to have it re&s;tored; and the
Hollanders, having fir&s;t entirely de&s;troyed all the &s;pice
trees, maintained, that they had executed the treaty,
but that the Engli&s;h had been anew expelled during the
cour&s;e of the war. Charles renewed his preten&s;ions to
this i&s;land; and as the rea&s;ons on both &s;ides began to
multiply, and &s;eemed to require a long di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it
was agreed to transfer the treaty to &s;ome other place;
and Charles made choice of Breda.</P>
<P>LORD Hollis and Henry Coventry were the Engli&s;h
Amba&s;&s;adors. They immediately de&s;ired, that a &s;u&s;pen|&s;ion
of arms &s;hould be agreed to, till the &s;everal claims
&s;hould be adju&s;ed: But this propo&s;al, &s;eemingly &s;o na|tural,
was rejected by the intere&s;t of de Wit. That
penetrating and active mini&s;ter, thoroughly acquainted
with the characters of Princes and the &s;ituation of af|fairs,
had di&s;covered an opportunity of &s;triking a blow,
which might at once re&s;tore to the Dutch the honour
lo&s;t during the war, and &s;everely revenge tho&s;e injuries,
which he a&s;cribed to the wanton ambition and inju&s;tice
of the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P>WHATEVER projects might have been formed by
Charles for &s;ecreting the money granted him by parlia|ment,
he had hitherto failed in his intention. The ex|pences
<PB N="429" REF="523">
of &s;uch va&s;t armaments had exhau&s;ted all the
&s;upplies<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">The Dutch had &s;pent on the war near 40 millions of livres a year, above 3 millions &s;terling: A much greater &s;um than had been granted by the Eng|li&s;h parliament. D'E&s;trades, 24th of December 1665; 1&s;t of January 1666. Temple, vol. i. p. 71. It was probably the want of money which engaged the King to pay the &s;eamen with tickets; a contrivance which proved &s;o much to their lo&s;$.</NOTE>; and even a great debt was contracted to the
&s;eamen. The King therefore was re&s;olved to &s;ave as
far as po&s;&s;ible, the la&s;t &s;upply of 1,80,000 pounds;
and to employ it for payment of his debts, as well tho&s;e
occa&s;ioned by the war, as tho&s;e which either nece&s;&s;ity,
or plea&s;ure, or genero&s;ity had formerly engaged him to
contract. He ob&s;erved, that the Dutch had been with
great reluctance forced into the war, and that the events
of it were not &s;uch as to in&s;pire them with great de&s;ire
of its continuance. The French, he knew, had been
engaged into ho&s;tilities by no other motive than that of
&s;upporting their allies; and were now more de&s;irous
than ever of putting an end to the quarrel. The di&s;|ferences
between the parties were &s;o incon&s;iderable, that
the conclu&s;ion of peace appeared ab&s;olutely in&s;allible;
and nothing but forms, or at lea&s;t &s;ome vain points of
honour, &s;eemed to remain for the Amba&s;&s;adors at Breda
to di&s;cu&s;s. In this &s;ituation, Charles, allured by the
pro&s;pect of gain, ra&s;hly remitted his preparations, and
expo&s;ed England to one of the greate&s;t affronts, which
it has ever received. Two &s;mall &s;quadrons alone were
equipped; and during a war with &s;uch potent and mar|tial
enemies, every thing was left almo&s;t in the &s;ame
&s;ituation as in times of the mo&s;t profound tranquillity.</P>
<P>DE WIT protracted the negotiations at Breda, and
ha&s;tened the naval preparations. The Dutch fleet ap|peared
in the Thames under the command of de Ruy|ter,
and threw the Engli&s;h into the utmo&s;t con&s;terna|tion.
A chain had been drawn cro&s;s the river Medway;
&s;ome fortifications had been added to Sheerne&s;s and Up|nore
<PB N="430" REF="524">
ca&s;tle: But all the&s;e preparations were unequal to
the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity. Sheerne&s;s was &s;oon taken; nor
could it be &s;aved by the valour of Sir Edward Sprague,
who defended it. Having the advantage of a &s;pring
tide, and an ea&s;terly wind, the Dutch pre&s;&s;ed on,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of June Di&s;grace at Chatham.</NOTE> and
broke the chain, though fortified by &s;ome &s;hips, which
had been there &s;unk by order of the Duke of Albe|marle.
They burned the three &s;hips, which lay to guard
the chain, the Matthias, the Unity, and the Charles
the fifth. After damaging &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing
them&s;elves of the hull of the Royal Charles, which the
Engli&s;h had burned, they advanced with &s;ix men of war,
and five fire-&s;hips, as far as Upnore ca&s;tle, where they
burned the Royal Oak, the Loyal London, and the Great
James. Captain Douglas, who commanded on board the
Royal Oak, peri&s;hed in the flames, tho' he had an ea&s;y op|portunity
of e&s;caping. &startq;Never was it known,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;that a Douglas had left his po&s;t without orders<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 41.</NOTE>.&endq;
The Hollanders fell down the Medway without receiv|ing
any con&s;iderable damage; and it was apprehended,
that they might next tide fail up the Thames, and ex|tend
their ho&s;tilities even to the bridge of London.
Nine &s;hips were &s;unk at Woolwich, four at Blackwall:
Platforms were rai&s;ed in many places, furni&s;hed with
artillery: The train bands were called out; and every
place was full of the utmo&s;t di&s;order, The Dutch
&s;ailed next to Port&s;mouth, where they made a fruitle&s;s
attempt: They met with no better &s;ucce&s;s at Ply|mouth:
They in&s;ulted Harwich: They &s;ailed again up
the Thames as far as Tilbury, where they were repul|&s;ed.
The whole coa&s;t was in alarm; and had the
French thought proper at this time to join the Dutch
fleet, and to invade England, con&s;equences the mo&s;t
fatal might ju&s;tly have been apprehended. But Lewis
had no intention to pu&s;h the victory to &s;uch extremi|ties.
<PB N="431" REF="525">
His intere&s;t required, that a ballance &s;hould be
kept between the two maritime powers; not that an
uncontrouled &s;uperiority &s;hould be given to either.</P>
<P>Great indignation prevailed among&s;t the Engli&s;h, to
&s;ee an enemy, whom they regarded as inferior, whom
they had expected totally to &s;ubdue, and over whom
they had gained many honourable advantages, now of a
&s;udden ride undi&s;puted ma&s;ters of the ocean, burn their
&s;hips in their very harbours, &s;ill every place with
confu&s;ion, and &s;trike a terror into the capital it&s;elf.
But though the cau&s;e of all the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters could be
as&s;cribed neither to bad fortune, to the mi&s;conduct
of admirals, nor the mi&s;behaviour of &s;emen, but
&s;olely to the avarice, at lea&s;t to the improvi|dence,
of the government; no dangerous &s;ymptoms of
di&s;content appeared, and no attempt for an in&s;urrection
was made by any of tho&s;e numerous &s;ectaries, who had
been &s;o openly branded for their rebellious principles,
and who upon that &s;uppo&s;ition had been treated with
&s;uch &s;everity<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Some nonconformi&s;ts however, both in Scotland and England, had kept a corre&s;pondence with the States, and had entertained projects for in&s;urrections, but they were too weak even to attempt the execution of them. D'E&s;trades, 13th of October, 1665.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, two expedients were em|braced:
An army of 12,000 men was &s;uddenly levied;
and the parliament, though it lay under prorogation,
was &s;ummoned to meet. The hou&s;es were very thin;
and the only vote, which the Commons pa&s;&s;ed, was an
address for breaking the army; which was complied
with. This expre&s;&s;ion of jealou&s;y &s;hewed the court
what they might expect from that a&s;&s;embly; and it was
thought mo&s;t prudent to prorogue them till next winter.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;igning the treaty at Breda, extricated the<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July Peace of Bre|da.</NOTE>
King from his pre&s;ent difficulties. The Engli&s;h Am|ba&s;&s;adors
received orders to recede from tho&s;e demands,
<PB N="432" REF="526">
which, however frivolous in them&s;elves, could not now
be relinqui&s;hed, without acknowledging a &s;uperiority in
the enemy. Polerone remained with the Dutch; &s;atisfac|tion
for the &s;hips, Bonaventure and Good-hope, the pre|tended
grounds of the quarrel, was no longer in&s;i&s;ted on;
Acadie was yielded to the French. The acqui&s;ition of
New-York, a &s;ettlement &s;o important by its &s;ituation,
was the chief advantage which the Engli&s;h reaped
from a war, in which the national character of bra|very
had &s;hone out with great lu&s;tre, but where the
mi&s;conduct of the government, e&s;pecially in the con|clu&s;ion
had been no le&s;s apparent.</P>
<P>To appea&s;e the people by &s;ome &s;acrifice &s;eemed re|quisite<NOTE PLACE="marg">Clarendon's fall.</NOTE>
qui&s;ite before the meeting of the parliament; and the
prejudices of the nation plainly pointed out the victim.
The Chancellor was at this time much expo&s;ed to the
hatred of the public, and of every party, which divided
the nation. All the numerous &s;ectaries regarded him as
their determined enemy; and a&s;cribed to his advice
and influence, tho&s;e per&s;ecuting laws, to which they
had &s;o long been expo&s;ed. The catholics knew, that
while he retained any authority, all their credit with
the King and the Duke would be entirely u&s;ele&s;s to
them, nor mu&s;t they ever expect any favour or indul|gence.
Even the royali&s;ts, di&s;appointed in their &s;an|guine
hopes of pre&s;erment, threw a great load of envy
on Clarendon, into who&s;e hands the King &s;eemed at
fir&s;t to have re&s;igned the whole power of government.
The &s;ale of Dunkik, the bad payment of the &s;eamen,
the di&s;grace at Chatham, the un&s;ucce&s;sful conclu&s;ion of
the war; all the&s;e misfortunes were charged on the
Chancellor, who, though he had ever oppo&s;ed the rup|ture
with Holland, thought it &s;till his duty to ju&s;tify
what he could not prevent. A building likewi&s;e of
more expence and magnificence than his &s;lender fortune
could afford, being unwarily undertaken by him, much
<PB N="433" REF="527">
expo&s;ed him to public reproach, as if he had acquired
great riches by corruption. The populace gave it com|monly
the appellation of Dunkirk Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf, who had always more revered
than loved the Chancellor, was now totally e&s;tranged
from him. Amid&s;t the di&s;&s;olute manners of the court,
that mini&s;ter &s;till maintained an inflexible dignity, and
would not &s;ubmit to any conde&s;cen&s;ions, which he
deemed unworthy his age and character. Buckingham,
a man of pro$$igate morals, happy in his talent of ridi|cule,
but expo&s;ed in his own conduct to all the ridi|cule,
but expo&s;ed in his own conduct to all the ridi|cule,
which he threw on others, &s;till made him the ob|ject
of his raillery, and gradually le&s;&s;ened in the King
that regard, which he bore to his mini&s;ter. When any
difficulties aro&s;e, either for want of power or money,
the blame was &s;till ca&s;t on him, who, it was believed,
had carefully at the re&s;toration checked all lavi&s;h con|ce&s;&s;ions
to the King. And what perhaps touched
Charles more nearly, he found in Clarendon, it is &s;aid,
ob&s;tacles to his plea&s;ure as well as to his ambition.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;gu&s;ted with the homely per&s;on of his
&s;pou&s;e, and de&s;irous of having children, had hearkened
to propo&s;als of obtaining a divorce, on pretence either
of her being pre-engaged to another, or of having made
a vow of cha&s;tity before her marriage. He was farther
&s;timulated by his pa&s;&s;ion for Mrs. Stuart, daughter to a
Scots gentleman; a lady of great beauty, and who&s;e
virtue he had hitherto &s;ound impregnable: But Claren|don,
apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences attending a di&s;|puted
title, and perhaps anxious for the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
his grandchildren, engaged the Duke of Richmond to
marry Mrs. Stuart, and thereby put an end to the
King's hopes. It is pretended, that Charles never for|gave
this di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>WHEN politics, therefore, and inclination both con|curred
to make the King &s;acrifice Glarendon to popular
<PB N="434" REF="528">
prejudices, the memory of his pa&s;t &s;ervices was not able any
longer to delay his fall. The &s;eals were taken from him,
and given to Sir Orlando Bridgeman. Southampton the
Trea&s;urer was now dead, who had per&s;evered to the utmo&s;t
in his attachments to the Chancellor. The la&s;t time he
appeared at the council board, he exerted his friendship
with a vigour, which neither age nor in&s;irmities could
abate. &startq;This man,&endq; &s;aid he, &s;peaking of Clarendon,
&startq;is a true prote&s;tant, and an hone&s;t Engli&s;hman; and
while he enjoys power, we are &s;ecure of our laws,
liberties, and religion. I dread the con&s;equences of
his removal.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT the fall of the Chancellor was not &s;ufficient to
gratify the malice of his enemies: His total ruin was
re&s;olved on. The Duke of York in vain exerted his
intere&s;t in behalf of his father-in-law. Both Prince and
people united in promoting that violent mea&s;ure; and
no means were thought &s;o proper for ingratiating the
court with a parliament, which had &s;o long been go|verned
by that very mini&s;ter, who was now to be the
victim of their prejudices.</P>
<P>SOME popular acts paved the way for the &s;e&s;&s;ion;
and the parliament, in their fir&s;t addre&s;s, gave the King
thanks for the&s;e in&s;tances of his goodne&s;s, and among
the re&s;t, they took care to mention his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of
Clarendon. The King, in reply, a&s;&s;ured the Hou&s;es,
that he would never again employ that nobleman in
any public office what&s;oever. Immediately, the charge
again&s;t him was opened in the Hou&s;e of Commons
by Mr. Seymour, afterwards Sir Edward, and con|&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventeen articles. The Hou&s;e, without
examining particulars, farther than hearing gene|ral
affirmations, that all would be proved, immedi|ately
voted his impeachment. Many of the articles<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">The articles were, that he had advi&s;ed the King to govern by military power without parliaments, that he had affirmed the King to be a papi&s;t or popi&s;hly affected, that he had received great &s;ums of money for procuring the Canary patent, and other illegal patents, that he had advi&s;ed and procured divers of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects to be impri&s;oned again&s;t law, in remote i&s;lands and gar|ri&s;ons, thereby to prevent their having the benefit of the law, that he had procured the cu&s;toms to be farmed at under-rates, that he received great &s;ums from the Vintners' Company, for allowing them to inhance the price of wines, that he had in a &s;hort time gained a greater e&s;tate than could have been &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e from the profits of his offices, that he had introduced an ar|bitrary government into his Maje&s;ty's plantations, that he had rejected a pro|po&s;al for the pre&s;ervation of Nevis and St. Chri&s;tophers, which was the occa|&s;ion of great lo&s;&s;es in tho&s;e parts, that when he was in his Majesty's &s;ervice beyond &s;ea he held a corre&s;pondence with Cromwel and his accomplices, that he advi&s;ed the &s;ale of Dunkirk, that he had unduly altered Jetters patent under the King's $eal, that he had unduly decided cau&s;es in council. which &s;hould have been brought before chancery, that he had i&s;&s;ued quo warrantos again&s;t corporations with an intention of &s;quezing money from them, that he had taken money for pa&s;&s;ing the bill of &s;ettlement of Ireland, that he betrayed the nation in all foreign treaties, and that he was the principal advi&s;er of dividing the fleet in June 1666.</NOTE>
<PB N="435" REF="529">
we know to be either false or &s;rivolous; and &s;uch of
them, as we are le&s;s acquainted with, we may fairly
pre&s;ume to be no better grounded. His advi&s;ing the
&s;ale of Dunkirk, &s;eems the heavie&s;t and true&s;t part of
the charge; but a mi&s;take in judgment, allowing it to
be &s;uch, where there appears no &s;ymptoms of corruption
or bad inten$$$ons, it would be very hard to charge as a
crime on any mini&s;ter. The King's nece&s;&s;ities, which
occa&s;ioned that mea&s;ure, cannot with any appearance of
rea&s;on be imputed to Clarendon; and chiefly proceeded
from the over-frugal maxims of the parliament it&s;elf, in
not granting the proper &s;upplies to the crown.</P>
<P>WHEN the charge was carried up to the Peers, as it
contained an accu&s;ation of trea&s;on in general, without
&s;pecifying any particulars, it &s;eemed not a &s;ufficient
ground for committing Clarendon to cu&s;tody. The
precedents of Strafford and Laud were not, by rea&s;on of
the violence of the times, deemed a proper autho|rity;
but as the Commons &s;till in&s;i&s;ted upon his com|mitment,
it was nece&s;&s;ary to appoint a free conference
<PB N="436" REF="530">
between the Hou&s;es. The Lords per&s;evered in their re|&s;olution;
and the Commons voted this conduct to be an
ob&s;truction to public ju&s;tice, and a precedent of evil and
dangerous con&s;equence. They al&s;o cho&s;e a committee
to draw up a vindication of their own proceedings.</P>
<P>CLARENDON, finding that the popular torrent, united
to the violence of power, ran with great impetuo&s;ity
again&s;t him, and that a defence, offered to &s;uch pre|judiced
ears, would be entirely ineffectual, thought pro|per
to withdraw him&s;elf. At Calais, he wrote a paper
addre&s;&s;ed to the Hou&s;e of Lords. He there &s;aid, that his
fortune, which was but moderate, had been gained entirely
by the lawful, avowed profits of his office, and by the
voluntary bounty of the King; that during the fir&s;t
years after the re&s;toration he had always concurred in
opinion with the other coun&s;ellors, men of &s;uch repu|tation
that no one could entertain &s;u&s;picions of their
wi&s;dom or integrity; that his credit &s;oon declined, and
however he might di&s;approve of &s;ome mea&s;ures, he
&s;ound it in vain to oppo&s; them; that his repugnance
to the Dutch war, the &s;ource of all the public griev|ances,
was always generally known, as well as his dis|approbation
of many unhappy &s;teps taken in conduct|ing
it; and that whatever pretence might be made of
national offences, his real crime, that which had exa$|perated
his powerful enemies, was his frequent oppo&s;|tion
to oxorbitant grants, which the importunity of
&s;itors had extorted from his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THIS paper the Lords tran&s;mitted to the Commons
under the appellation of a libel; and by a vote of both
Hou&s;es, it was condemned to be burned by the hands of
the hangman. They next proceeded to exert their $span$
power again&s;t Clarendon, and pa&s;&s;ed a bill of
$word$ and incapacity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$span$</NOTE> which received the royal
$span$ retired into France, where he lived in a
$span$. He &s;urvived his bani&s;hment &s;ix years;
<PB N="437" REF="531">
and he employed his lei&s;ure chiefly in reducing into or|der
the Hi&s;tory of the Civil Wars, for which he had
before collected materials. The performance does great
honour to his memory; and, except Whitelock's Me|morials,
is the mo&s;t candid account of tho&s;e times,
compo&s;ed by any cotemporary author.</P>
<P>CLARENDON was always a friend to the liberty and
the con&s;titution of his country. At the commencement
of the civil wars, he had entered into the late King's
&s;ervice, and was honoured with a great &s;hare in the
esteem and friend&s;hip of that monarch: He was pur&s;ued
with unrele$ting animo&s;ity by the Long Parliament:
He had &s;hared all the &s;ortunes and directed all the coun|cils
of the pre&s;ent King during his exile: He had been
advanced to the highe&s;t tru&s;t and offices after the re&s;to|ration:
Yet all the&s;e circum&s;tances, which might na|turally
operate with &s;uch force, either on re$entment,
gra$itude, or ambition, had no influence on his uncor|rupted
mind. It is &s;aid, that when he fir&s;t engaged in
the &s;tudy of the law, his father exhorted him with great
earne&s;tne&s;s to &s;hun the practice too common in that pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
of &s;training every point in favour of preroga|tive,
and perverting &s;o u&s;eful a &s;cience to the oppre&s;&s;ion
of liberty: And in the mid&s;t of the&s;e rational and vir|tious
councils, which he re-iterated, he was &s;uddenly
&s;eized with an apoplexy, and expired in his &s;on's pre|&s;ence.
This circum&s;tance gave additional weight to the
principles, which he inculcated.</P>
<P>THE combination of King and &s;ubject to oppre&s;s &s;o
good a mini&s;ter affords, to men of oppo&s;ite di&s;po&s;itions,
an equal occa&s;ion of inveighing again&s;t the ingratitude
of Princes, or ignorance of the people. Charles &s;eems
never to have mitigated his re&s;entment again&s;t Claren|don;
and the national prejudices pur&s;ued him to his re|treat
in France. A company of Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, be|ing
<PB N="438" REF="532">
quartered near him, a&s;&s;aulted his hou&s;e, broke open
the doors, gave him a dangerous wound on the head,
and would have proceeded to the la&s;t extremity, had
not their officers, hearing of the violence, happily in|terpo&s;ed</P>
<P>THE next expedient,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1668.</NOTE> which the King embraced, in
order to acquire popularity, is much more de&s;erving of
prai&s;e; and, had it been &s;teadily pur&s;ued, would pro|bably
have rendered his reign happy, certainly his me|mory
glorious. It is the Triple Alliance of which I
&s;peak; a mea&s;ure, which gave entire &s;atisfaction to the
public.</P>
<P>THE glory of France, which had long been eclip&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of France.</NOTE>
either by dome&s;tic factions, or by the &s;uperior force of
the Spani&s;h monarchy, began now to break out with
great lu$tre, and to engage the attention of all the
neighbouring nations: The independant power and
mutinous &s;pirit of the nobility were &s;ubdued: The po|poular
preten&s;ions of the parliament re&s;trained: The Hu|gonot
party reduced to &s;ubjection: That exten&s;ive and
&s;ertile country, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of every advantage both of cli|mate
and &s;ituation, was fully peopled with ingenious
and indu&s;trious inhabitants: And while the &s;pirit of the
nation di&s;covered all the vigour and bravery requi&s;ite for
great enterprizes, it was tamed to an entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion
under the will of the Sovereign.</P>
<P>THE Sovereign, who now filled the throne, was well
adapted, by his per&s;onal character,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of Lewis XIV.</NOTE>, both to increa&s;e and
to avail him&s;elf of the&s;e mighty advantages. Lewis the
fourteenth, endowed with every quality, which could
enchant the people, po&s;&s;e&s;$ied many which merit the ap|probation
of the wi&s;e. The ma&s;culine beauty of his
per&s;on was embelli&s;hed with a noble air: The dignity of
his behaviour was tempered with the highe&s;t affability
<PB N="439" REF="533">
and politene&s;s: Elegant without effeminacy, addicted
to plea&s;ure without neglecting bu&s;ine&s;s, decent in his
very vices, and beloved in the mid&s;t of arbitrary power;
he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed all cotemporary monarchs, as in grandeur,
&s;o likewi&s;e in fame and glory.</P>
<P>His ambition, regulated by prudence, not by ju&s;tice,
had carefully provided every means of conque&s;t; and
before he put him&s;elf in motion, he &s;eemed to have ab|&s;olutely
en&s;ured &s;ucce&s;s. His finances were brought
into order: A naval power created: His armies in|crea&s;ed
and di&s;ciplined: Magazines and military &s;tores
provided: And though the magnificence of his court
was &s;upported beyond all former example, &s;o regular
was the occonomy ob&s;erved, and &s;o willingly did the
people, now enriched by arts and commerce, &s;ubimit to
mutliplied taxes, that his military force much exceeded
what in any preceding age had ever been employed by
any European monarch.</P>
<P>THE &s;udden decline and almo&s;t total fall of the Spa|ni&s;h
monarchy opened an inviting field to &s;o enterpri&s;|ing
a Prince, and &s;eemed to promi&s;e him an ea&s;y and
univer&s;al conque&s;t. The other nations of Europe,
&s;eeble or ill-governed, were a&s;toni&s;hed at the great|ne&s;s
of his rifing empire; and all of them ca&s;t their
eyes towards England, as the only power, which could
&s;ave them from that &s;ubjection, with which they were
&s;o nearly threatened.</P>
<P>THE animo&s;ity, which had antiently &s;ub&s;i&s;ted be|tween
the Engli&s;h and French nations, and which had
been &s;u&s;pended for above a century by the jealou&s;y of
Spani&s;h greatne&s;s, began to revive and to exert it&s;elf.
The glory of pre&s;erving the ballance of Europe, a glory
&s;o much founded on ju&s;tice and humanity, flattered the
ambition of England; and the whole people were eager
to provide for their own future &s;ecurity, by oppo&s;ing
<PB N="440" REF="534">
the progre&s;s of &s;o hated a rival. The pro&s;pect of em|bracing
&s;uch mea&s;ures had contributed, among other
rea&s;ons, to render the peace of Breda &s;o univer&s;ally ac|ceptable
to the nation. By the death of Philip the
fourth, King of Spain, an inviting opportunity, and
&s;ome very &s;lender pretences, had been afforded to call
forth the ambition of Lewis.</P>
<P>AT the treaty of the Pyrenees, when Lewis espou&s;ed
the Spani&s;h Prince&s;s, he had renounced every title of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion to every part of the Spani&s;h monarchy; and
this renounciation had been couched in the mo&s;t accu|rate
and mo&s;t preci&s;e terms, which language could af|ford.
But on the death of his father-in-law, he retracted
his renounciation, and pretended, that natural rights,
depending on blood and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, could not be anni|hilated
by any extorted deed or contract. Philip had le&s;t
a &s;on, Charles the &s;econd of Spain; but as the Queen
of France was of a former marriage, &s;he laid claim to
a con&s;iderable province of the Spani&s;h monarchy, even
to the exclu&s;ion of her brother. By the cu&s;toms of &s;ome
parts of Brabant, a female of a fir&s;t marriage was pre|ferred
to a male of a &s;econd, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to private
inheritances; and Lewis thence inferred, that his Queen
had acquired a right to the dominion of that important
dutchy.</P>
<P>A CLAIM of this nature was more properly &s;upported
by military force than by argument and rea&s;oning.<NOTE PLACE="marg">French in|va&s;ion of the Low Coun|tries.</NOTE>
Lewis appeared on the frontiers of the Netherlands with
a numerous army of 40,000 men, commanded by the
be&s;t generals of the age, and provided of every thing
nece&s;&s;ary for action. The Spaniards, though they might
have fore&s;een this mea&s;ure, were totally unprepared.
Their towns, without magazines, without fortifications,
without garri&s;ons, fell into the hands of the French
King, as &s;oon as he pre&s;ented him&s;elf before them.
<PB N="441" REF="535">
Athe, Li&s;le, Tournay, Oudenarde, Courtray, Charleroi,
Binche were immediately taken: And it was vi&s;ible,
that no force in the Low Countries was able to &s;top or
retard the progre&s;s of the French arms.</P>
<P>THIS mea&s;ure, executed with &s;o much celerity and &s;uc|ce&s;s,
gave great alarm to almo&s;t every court in Europe. It
had been ob&s;erved with what dignity, or even haughti|ne&s;s,
Lewis, from the time he began to govern, had
ever &s;upported all his rights and preten&s;ions. D'E&s;trades,
the French Amba&s;&s;ador, and Watteville, the Spani&s;h,
having quarrelled in London, on account of their preten|&s;ion
for precedency, the French monarch was not &s;ati&s;|fied,
till Spain &s;ent to Paris a &s;olemn emba&s;&s;y, and pro|mi&s;ed
never more to revive &s;uch conte&s;ts. Crequi,
his Amba&s;&s;ador in Rome, had met with an affront from
the Pope's guards. The Pope, Alexander the &s;eventh,
had been obliged to break his guards, to di&s;patch his
newphew to a&s;k pardon, and to allow a pillar to be erect|ed
in Rome it&s;elf, as a monument of his own humilia|tion.
The King of England too had experienced the
high &s;pirit and un&s;ubmitting temper of Lewis. A claim
of precedency in the Engli&s;h flag having been advan|ced,
the French monarch remon&s;trated with &s;uch vig|our,
and prepared him&s;elf to re&s;i&s;t with &s;uch courage,
that Charles found it more prudent to de&s;i&s;t from his
preten&s;ions. The King of England, &s;aid Lewis to his
Amba&s;&s;ador D'E&s;trades, may know my force, but he
knows not the &s;entiments of my heart: Every thing
appears to me contemptible in compari&s;on of glory<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">25th of January, 1662.</NOTE>.
The&s;e mea&s;ures of conduct had given &s;trong indications
of his character: But the inva&s;ion of Flanders di&s;cover|ed
an ambition, which, being &s;upported by &s;uch over|grown
power, menaced the general liberties of Europe.</P>
<P>As no State lay nearer the danger, none was &s;eized
with more terror than the United Provinces. They
<PB N="442" REF="536">
were &s;till engaged, together with France, in a war
again&s;t England; and Lewis had promi&s;ed them, that
he would take no &s;teps again&s;t Spain without previou&s;ly
informing them: But, contrary to this a&s;&s;urance, he kept
a total &s;ilence, till on the very point of entering upon
action. If the renounciation, made at the treaty of the
Pyrenees, was not valid, it was fore&s;een, that, upon
the death of the King of Spain, a &s;ickly in$ant, the
whole monarchy would be claimed by Lewis; after
which it would be vainly expected to &s;et bounds to his
preten&s;ions. Charles, acquainted with the&s;e well-grounded
apprehen&s;ions of the Dutch, had been the
more ob&s;tinate in in&s;i&s;ting on conditions at Breda; and
by delaying to &s;ign the treaty, had imprudently expo&s;ed
him&s;elf to the &s;ignal di&s;grace, which he received at
Chatham. De Wit, &s;en&s;ible, that a few week's delay
would be of no con&s;equence in the Low Countries,
took this opportunity of &s;triking an important blow,
and of fini&s;hing the war with honour to him&s;elf and to
his country.</P>
<P>NEGOTIATIONS<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations.</NOTE> meanwhile commenced for the &s;av|ing
Flanders; but no re&s;i&s;tance was made to the French
arms. The Spani&s;h mini&s;ters exclaimed every where
again&s;t the flagrant inju&s;tice of Lewis's preten&s;ions, and
repre&s;ented it to be the intere&s;t of every power in Eu|rope,
even more than of Spain it&s;elf, to prevent his
conque&s;t of the Low Countries. The Emperor and the
German Princes di&s;covered evident &s;ymptoms of di&s;con|tent;
but their motions were flow and backward. The
States, though terrified at the pro&s;pect of having their
frontiers expo&s;ed to &s;o formidable a foe, &s;aw no re&s;ource,
no means of safety. England indeed &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to
make oppo&s;ition to the French; but the variable and
impolitic conduct of Charles kept that republic from
making him any open advances, by which they might
lo&s;e the friend&s;hip of France, without acquiring any
<PB N="443" REF="537">
new ally. And though Lewis, dreading a combination
of all Europe, had offered terms of accommodation,
the Dutch apprehended le&s;t the&s;e, either from the ob|&s;tinacy
of the Spaniards, or the ambition of the
French, would never be carried into execution.</P>
<P>CHARLES re&s;olved with great prudence to take the
fir&s;t &s;tep towards a confederacy. Sir William Temple,
his re&s;ident at Bru&s;&s;els, received orders to go &s;ecretly to
the Hague, and to concert with the States the means of
&s;aving the Netherlands. This man, whom philo&s;ophy
had taught to de&s;pi&s;e the world, without rendering him
unfit for it, was frank, open, sincere, &s;uperior to the
little tricks of vulgar politicians: And meeting in de
Wit with a man of the &s;ame generous and enlarged
&s;entiments, he immediately opened his ma&s;ter's inten|tion,
and pre&s;&s;ed a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion. A treaty was
from the fir&s;t negotiated between the&s;e two &s;tate&s;men
with the &s;ame cordiality, as if it were a private affair,
tran&s;acted between two intimate companions. Deeming
the inter&s;s of their country the &s;ame, they gave full
&s;cope to that &s;ympathy of character, which di&s;po&s;ed
them to an intire reliance on each others profe&s;&s;ions and
engagements. And though the jealou&s;y again&s;t the
hou&s;e of Orange might in&s;pire de Wit with an aver&s;ion
to a &s;trict union with England, he generou&s;ly re&s;olved
to &s;acrifice all private con&s;iderations to the public &s;er|vice.</P>
<P>TEMPLE pre&s;&s;ed an offen&s;ive league between England
and Holland, in order to oblige France to relinqui&s;h all
her conque&s;ts: But de Wit told him, that this mea&s;ure
was too bold and precipitant to be agreed to by the
States. He &s;aid, that the French were the old and
con&s;tant allies of the republic; and till matters came to
extremity, &s;he never would deem it prudent to abandon
a friend&s;hip &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, and rely entirely on a
<PB N="444" REF="538">
treaty with England, which had lately waged &s;o cruel a
war again&s;t her: That ever &s;ince the reign of Elizabeth,
there had been &s;uch a fluctuation in the Engli&s;h coun|cils,
that it was not po&s;&s;ible, for two years together, to
take any &s;ure or certain mea&s;ures with that kingdom:
That though the pre&s;ent mini&s;try, having entered into
views &s;o conformable to national intere&s;t, promi&s;ed
greater firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, it might &s;till be un&s;afe,
in a bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;uch con&s;equence, to put entire confi|dence
in them: That the French monarch was young,
haughty, and powerful; and if treated in &s;o imperious
a manner, would expo&s;e him&s;elf to the greate&s;t extremi|ties
rather than &s;ubmit: That it was &s;ufficient, if he
could be con&s;trained to adhere to the offers, which he him|&s;elf
had already made; and if the remaining provinces of
the Low Countries could be thereby &s;aved from the
danger, with which they were at pre&s;ent threatned:
And that the other powers, in Germany and the north,
who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance they might expect, would be satisfied
with putting a &s;top to the French conque&s;ts, without
pretending to recover the places, which were already
lo&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h Amba&s;&s;ador was contented to accept of
the terms, propo&s;ed by the pen&s;ionary. Lewis had of|fered
to relinqui&s;h all the Queen's rights on condition
either of keeping the conque&s;ts, which he had made
la&s;t campaign, or of receiving, in lieu of them, Franche|comt&eacute;,
together with Cambray, Aire, and St. Omers.
De Wit and Temple founded their treaty upon this pro|po&s;al.
They agreed to offer their mediation to the con|tending
powers, and oblige France to adhere to this al|ternative,
and Spain to accept of it. If Spain refu&s;ed,
they agreed, that France &s;hould not pro&s;ecute her claim
by arms, but leave it entirely to England and Holland
to employ force for making the terms effectual. And
the remainder of the Low Countries they thenceforth
<PB N="445" REF="539">
guaranteed to Spain. A defen&s;ive treaty was likewi&s;e
concluded between Holland and England.</P>
<P>THE articles of this confederacy were &s;oon adju&s;ted
by &s;uch candid and able negotiators: But the greate&s;t
difficulty &s;till remained. By the con&s;titution of the re|public,
all the towns in all the provinces mu&s;t give their
con&s;ent to every treaty; and be&s;ides that this formality
could not be di&s;patched in le&s;s than two months, it
was ju&s;tly to be dreaded, that the in$$ence of France
would ob&s;truct the pa&s;&s;age of the treaty in &s;ome of the
&s;maller cities. D'E&s;trades, the French Amba&s;&s;ador, a
man of great ability, hearing of the league, which was
on the carpet, treated it very lightly; &startq;Six weeks
hence,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;we &s;hall &s;peak to it.&endq; To ob|viate
this difficulty, de Wit had the courage, for the
public good, to break through the laws in &s;o fundamen|tal
an article; and by his authority, he prevailed with
the States General at once to &s;ign and ratify the league:
Though they acknowledged, that, if that mea&s;ure<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> &s;hould di&s;plea&s;e their con&s;tituents, they ri&s;qued their
heads by this irregularity. After &s;ealing, all parties
embraced with great cordiality. Temple cried out, <HI>At
Breda, as friends: Here, as brothers.</HI> And de Wit add|ed,
that now the matter was fini&s;hed, it looked like a
miracle.</P>
<P>ROOM had been left in the treaty for the acce&s;&s;ion of
Sweden,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Triple league.</NOTE> which was &s;oon after obtained; and thus was
concluded in five days the triple league; an event re|ceived
with equal &s;urpri&s;e and approbation by the world.
Notwith&s;tanding the unfortunate conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t
war, England now appeared in her proper &s;tation, and,
by this wi&s;e conduct, had recovered all her influence
and credit in Europe. Temple likewi&s;e received great
applau&s;e; but to all the compliments made him on that
occa&s;ion, he mode&s;tly replied: That to remove things
<PB N="446" REF="540">
from their center, or proper element, required force
and labour; but that of them&s;elves they ea&s;ily returned
to it.</P>
<P>THE French monarch was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with
this mea&s;ure. Not only bounds were at pre&s;ent &s;et to
his ambition: Such a barrier was al&s;o rai&s;ed as &s;eemed
for ever impregnable. And though his own offer was
made the foundation of the treaty, he had pre&s;cribed &s;o
&s;hort a time for the acceptance of that offer, that he
&s;till expected, from the delays and reluctance of Spain,
to find &s;ome opportunity of eluding it. The court of
Madrid &s;howed equal di&s;plea&s;ure. To be obliged to
give up any part of the Spani&s;h provinces, in lieu of
claims, &s;o apparently unju&s;t, and the&s;e urged with &s;uch
violence and haughtine&s;s, in&s;pired the highe&s;t di&s;gu&s;t.
Often did they threaten to abandon entirely the Low
Countries rather than &s;ubmit to &s;o cruel a mortifica|tion
and they endeavoured, by this menace, to terrify
the mediating powers into more vigorous mea&s;ures for
their &s;upport. But Temple and de Wit were better
acquainted with the views and intere&s;ts of Spain. They
knew, that &s;he mu&s;t &s;till retain the Low Countries, as
a bond of connexion with the other European powers,
who alone, if her young monarch &s;hould happen to die
without i&s;&s;ue, could en&s;ure her independency again&s;t
the preten&s;ions of France. They &s;till urged, therefore,
the terms of the triple league, and threatned Spain
with war in ca&s;e of refu&s;al. The plenipotentiaries of
all the powers met at Aix-la-Chapelle. Temple was
mini&s;ter for England; Van Beuninghen for Holland;
D'Hona for Sweden.</P>
<P>SPAIN at la&s;t, pre&s;&s;ed on all hands, accepted of the
alternative offered: but in her very compliance, &s;he
gave &s;trong &s;ymptoms of ill|humour and di&s;content. It
$word$ been apparent, that the Hollanders, entirely neg|lecting
<PB N="447" REF="541">
the honour of the Spani&s;h monarchy, had been
anxious only for their own &s;ecurity; and, provided
they could remove Lewis to a di&s;tance from their fron|tiers,
were more indifferent what progre&s;s he made in
all other places. Sen&s;ible of the&s;e views, the Queen|regent
of Spain re&s;olved &s;till to keep them in an anxiety,
which might for the future be the foundation of an
union more intimate than they were willing at pre&s;ent
to enter into. Franchecomt&eacute;, by a vigorous and well<NOTE PLACE="marg">Treaty of Aix-la-Cha|pelle.</NOTE>
concerted plan of the French King, had been conquer|ed,
in fifteen days, during a rigorous &s;ea&s;on, and in the
mid&s;t of winter. She cho&s;e therefore to recover this
province, and to abandon all the towns conquered in
Flanders during the la&s;t campaign. By this means,
Lewis extended his garri&s;ons into the heart of the Low
Countries; and a very feeble barrier remained to the
Spani&s;h provinces.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the advantages of his &s;ituation,
the French monarch could entertain &s;mall hopes of ever
extending his conque&s;ts on that quarter, which lay the
mo&s;t expo&s;ed to his ambition, and where his acqui&s;i|tions
were of mo&s;t importance. The triple league gua|ranteed
the remaining provinces to Spain; and the Em|peror
and other powers of Germany, who&s;e intere&s;ts
&s;eemed to be &s;trongly concerned, were invited to enter
into the &s;ame con&s;ederacy. Spain her&s;elf having about
this time, under the mediation of Charles, made peace
on equal terms with Portugal, might be expected to
exert more vigour in oppo&s;ition to her haughty and
triumphant rival. The mighty &s;atisfaction, expre&s;&s;ed
in England, on account of the councils now embraced
by the court, promi&s;ed the hearty concurrence of par|liament
in every mea&s;ure, which could be propo&s;ed for
oppo&s;ition to the grandeur of France. And thus all
Europe &s;eemed to repo&s;e her&s;elf with &s;ecurity under the
wings of that powerful confederacy, which had &s;o hap|pily
<PB N="448" REF="542">
been formed for her protection. It is now time to
give &s;ome account of the &s;tate of affairs in Scotland
and in Ireland.</P>
<P>THE Scots nation, though they had never been &s;ub|jects
to the arbitrary power of their prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Scotland.</NOTE> had but very
imperfect notions of law and liberty; and &s;carce in any
age had they ever enjoyed an admini&s;tration, which had
confined it&s;elf within the proper boundaries. By their
final union alone with England, their once hated anta|goni&s;t,
they have happily attained the experience of a
government perfectly regular, and exempt from all vio|lence
and inju&s;tice. Charles, from his aver&s;ion to bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
had entru&s;ted the affairs of that country to his
mini&s;ters, particularly Middleton; and the&s;e could not
forbear making very extraordinary &s;tretches of autho|rity</P>
<P>THERE had been intercepted a letter, wrote by Lorne
to Lord Duffus, in which, a little too plainly, but very
truly, he complained, that his enemies had endeavoured
by &s;al&s;hood to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the King again&s;t him. But he
&s;aid, that he had now di&s;covered them, and had defeated
them, and had gained the per&s;on, meaning the Earl of
Clarendon, upon whom the chief of them depended.
This letter was produced before the parliament; and
Lorne was tried upon an old, tyrannical, ab&s;urd law of
<HI>Lea&s;ing-making;</HI> by which it was rendered criminal to
belie the &s;ubjects to the King, or create in him an ill
opinion of them. He was condemned to die: But
Charles was much di&s;plea&s;ed with the &s;entence, and
granted him a pardon<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 149.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It was carried in parliament, that twelve per&s;ons,
without crime, witne&s;s, trial, or accu&s;er, &s;hould be de|clared
incapable of all tru&s;t or office; and to render this
inju&s;tice more egregious, it was agreed, that the&s;e per|&s;ons
<PB N="449" REF="543">
&s;hould be named by ballot: A method of voting,
which &s;everal republics had adopted at elections, in or|der
to prevent faction and intrigue; but which could
&s;erve only as a cover to malice and iniquity, in the in|flicting
of puni&s;hments. Lauderdale, Crawford, and
Sir Robert Murray, among others, were incapacitated:
But the King, who di&s;approved of this inju&s;tice, re|fu&s;ed
his a&s;&s;ent<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 152.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN act was pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t all per&s;ons, who &s;hould
move the King for re&s;toring the children of tho&s;e at|tainted
by parliament; an unheard-of re&s;traint on ap|plications
for grace and mercy. No penalty was affixed;
but the act was but the more violent and tyrannical on
that account. The court-lawyers had e&s;tabli&s;hed it as
a maxim, that the a&s;&s;igning a puni&s;hment was a limita|tion
of the crown: Whereas a law, forbidding any
thing, though without a penalty, made the offenders
criminal. And in that cafe, they determined, that the
puni&s;hment was arbitrary; only that it could not ex|tend
to life. Middleton as commi&s;&s;ioner pa&s;&s;ed this
act; though he had no in&s;tructions for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AN act of indemnity pa&s;&s;ed; but at the &s;ame time it
was voted, that all tho&s;e who had offended during the late
di&s;orders, &s;hould be &s;ubjected to fines; and a committee
of parliament was appointed for impo&s;ing them. The&s;e
proceeded without any regard to &s;ome equitable rules,
which the King had pre&s;cribed to them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 147.</NOTE>. The mo&s;t
obnoxious compounded &s;ecretly. No con&s;ideration was
had, either of men's e&s;tates, or of the degrees of their
guilt: No proofs were produced: Enquiries were not
&s;o much as made: But as fa&s;t as information was given
in again&s;t any man, he was marked down for a parti|cular
fine: And all was tran&s;acted in a &s;ecret com|mittee.
When the li&s;t was read in parliament, excep|tions
<PB N="450" REF="544">
were made to many: Some had been under age
during the civil wars; &s;ome had been abroad. But it
was &s;till replied, that a proper time would come, when
every man &s;hould be heard in his own defence. The
only intention, it was &s;aid, of &s;etting the fine was, that
&s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould have no benefit by the act of indem|nity,
unle&s;s they paid the &s;um demanded: Every one
that cho&s;e to &s;tand upon his innocence, and renounce
the benefit of the indemnity, might do it as his peril.
It was well known, that no one would dare &s;o far to &s;et
at defiance &s;o arbitrary an admini&s;tration. The King
wrote to the council, ordering them to &s;uper&s;ede the
levying tho&s;e fines: But Middleton found means,
during &s;ome time, to elude tho&s;e orders<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 201.</NOTE>. And at la&s;t,
the King obliged his mini&s;ters to compound for half
the &s;ums, which had been impo&s;ed. In all the&s;e tran&s;|actions,
and in mo&s;t others, which pa&s;&s;ed during the
pre&s;ent reign, we &s;till find the moderating hand of the
King, interpo&s;ed to protect the Scots from the oppre&s;|&s;ions,
which their own countrymen, employed in the
mini&s;try, were de&s;irous of exerci&s;ing over them.</P>
<P>BUT the chief circum&s;tance, whence were derived all
the &s;ub&s;equent tyranny and di&s;orders in Scotland, was
the rigorous execution of the laws for the e&s;tabli&s;hment
of epi&s;copacy, to which a great part of the nation had
entertained the mo&s;t un&s;urmountable aver&s;ion. The
right of patrons had for &s;ome years been aboli&s;hed; and
the power of electing mini&s;ters had been ve&s;ted in the
kirk-&s;e&s;&s;ion, and lay-elders. It was now enacted, that
all incumbents, who had been admitted upon this title,
&s;hould receive a pre&s;entation from the patron, and
&s;hould be in&s;tituted anew by the bi&s;hop, under the pe|nalty
of deprivation. The more rigid pre&s;byterians con|certed mea&s;ures among them&s;elves, and refu&s;ed obe|dience:
<PB N="451" REF="545">
They imagined, that their number would protect
them. Three hundred and fifty pari&s;hes, above a
third of the kingdom, were at once declared vacant.
The we&s;tern counties chiefly were ob&s;tinate in this par|ticular.
New mini&s;ters were &s;ought for all over the
kingdom; and no one was &s;o ignorant or vicious as to
be rejected. The people, who loved extremely and
re&s;pected their former teachers; men remarkable for the
&s;everity of their manners, and their fervor in preach|ing;
were inflamed again&s;t the&s;e intruders, who had
obtained their livings under &s;uch invidious circum|&s;tances,
and who took no care, by the regularity of
their manners, to &s;often the prejudices contracted
again&s;t them. Even mo&s;t of tho&s;e, who retained their
livings by compliance, fell under the imputation of hy|pocri&s;y,
either by their &s;hewing a di&s;gu&s;t to the new
model of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, which they had ac|knowleged;
or on the other hand, by declaring, that
their former adherence to pre&s;bytery and the covenant
had been the re&s;ult of violence and nece&s;&s;ity. And as
Middleton and the new mini&s;try indulged them&s;elves in
great riot and di&s;order, to which the nation had been
little accu&s;tomed, an opinion univer&s;ally prevailed, that
any form of religion, offered by &s;uch hands, mu&s;t be
profane and impious.</P>
<P>THE people, notwith&s;tanding their di&s;contents, were
re&s;olved to give no handle again&s;t them, by the lea&s;t
&s;ymptom of mutiny or &s;edition: But this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;|po&s;ition
in&s;tead of procuring a mitigation of the ri|gours,
was made u&s;e of as an argument for continuing
the &s;ame mea&s;ures, which by their vigour had enforced
&s;o prompt an obedience. The King, however, was
di&s;gu&s;ted with the violence of Middleton<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 202.</NOTE>; and he
made Rothes Commi&s;&s;ioner in his place. This noble|man
<PB N="452" REF="546">
was already Pre&s;ident of the Council; and &s;oon
after was made Lord Keeper and Trea&s;urer. Lauderdale
&s;till continued Secretary of State, and commonly re&s;ided
at London.</P>
<P>AFFAIRS remained in a peaceable &s;ituation, till the &s;e|vere
law was made in England again&s;t conventicles<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1664.</NOTE>.
The Scots parliament imitated that violence, by pa&s;&s;ing a
like act. A kind of high-commi&s;&s;ion court was appointed,
for executing this rigorous law, and for the direction of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. But even this court, illegal as it
might be deemed, was much preferable to the method
next adopted. Military force was let loo&s;e by the coun|cil.
Wherever the people had generally for&s;aken their
churches, the guards were quartered through the coun|try.
Sir James Turner commanded them, a man who&s;e
natural ferocity of temper was often inflamed by the
u&s;e of &s;trong liquors. He went about the country, and
received from the mini&s;ters li&s;ts of tho&s;e who ab&s;ented
them&s;elves from church, or were &s;uppo&s;ed to frequent
conventicles. Without any proof or legal conviction,
he demanded a fine from them, and quartered &s;oldiers
on the &s;uppo&s;ed delinquents till he received payment.
As an in&s;urrection was dreaded during the Dutch war,
new forces were levied, and intru&s;ted to the command
of Dalzeil and Drummond; two officers, who had &s;erved
the King during the civil wars, and had afterwards re|tired
to Mu&s;covy, where they had increa&s;ed the native
cruelty of their di&s;po&s;ition. A full career was given to
their tyranny by the Scots mini&s;try. Repre&s;entations
were made to the King again&s;t the&s;e enormities. He
&s;eemed touched with the &s;tate of the country; and be|&s;ides
giving orders, that the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion
&s;hould be di&s;continued, he &s;ignified his opinion, that
another way of proceeding was nece&s;&s;ary to his &s;er|vice<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 213.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="453" REF="547">
THIS lenity of the King's came too late to remedy
the di&s;orders. The people, inflamed with bigotry, and
irritated by ill u&s;age, ro&s;e in arms. They were in&s;tigated
by Guthry, Semple, and other preachers. They &s;ur|pri&s;ed
Turner in Dumfries, and re&s;olved to have put
him to death; but finding, that his orders, which fell
into their hands, were more violent than his execution
of them, they &s;pared his life. At Laneric, after many
prayers, they renewed the covenant, and &s;et out their
manife&s;to; where they profe&s;&s;ed all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the
King: They de&s;ired only the re&s;toration of pre&s;bytery and
of their former mini&s;ters. As many gentlemen of their
party had been confined on &s;u&s;picion; Wallace and
Learmont, two officers, who had &s;erved, but in no
high rank, were entru&s;ted with the command. Their
force never exceeded two thou&s;and men; and though
the whole country bore them great favour, men's &s;pirits
were &s;o &s;ubdued, that the rebels could expect no farther
acce&s;&s;ion of numbers. Dalziel took the field to op|po&s;e
their progre&s;s. Their number was now dimini&s;hed
to 800; and the&s;e, having advanced near Edinburgh,
attempted to find their way back into the we&s;t by Pent|land
Hills. They were attacked by the King's forces<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">28th of November, 1666.</NOTE>.
Finding that they could not e&s;cape, they &s;topped their
march. Their mini&s;ters endeavoured to infu&s;e courage
into them. After finging &s;ome p&s;alms, they turned on
the enemy; and being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the advantage of the
ground, they received the fir&s;t charge very re&s;olutely.
But that was all the action: Immediately, they lo&s;t or|der,
and fled for their lives. About forty were killed on
the &s;pot, and a hundred and thirty taken pri&s;oners.
The re&s;t, favoured by the night, and by the wearine&s;s,
and even by the pity of the King's troops, made their
e&s;cape.</P>
<P><PB N="454" REF="548">
THE oppre&s;&s;ions which the&s;e people had &s;uffered, the
delu&s;ions under which they laboured, and their inoffen|&s;ive
behaviour during the in&s;urrection, made them the
objects of compa&s;&s;ion: Yet were the King's mini&s;ters,
particularly Sharpe, re&s;olute to take &s;evere vengeance.
Ten were hanged on one gibbet at Edinburgh: Thirty|five
before their own doors in different places. The&s;e
criminals might all have &s;aved their lives, if they would
have renounced the covenant. The executions were
going on, when the King put a &s;top to them. He &s;aid,
that blood enough had already been &s;hed; and he wrote
a letter, in which he ordered, that &s;uch of the pri|&s;oners,
as &s;hould &s;imply promi&s;e to obey the laws for
the future, &s;hould be &s;et at liberty, and that the incor|rigible
&s;hould be &s;ent to the plantations<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Burnet, p. 237.</NOTE>. This letter
was brought by Burnet, Archbi&s;hop of Gla&s;gow; but
not being immediately delivered to the council by
Sharpe, the Pre&s;ident<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Wodrow's Hi&s;tory, vol. i. p. 255.</NOTE>, one Maccail, had in the in|terval
been put to the torture, under which he expir|ed.
He &s;eemed to die in a triumph of joy. &startq;Fare|wel
&s;un, moon, and &s;tars; &s;arewel world and time;
farewel weak and frail body: Welcome eternity,
welcome angels and &s;aints, welcome Saviour of the
world, and welcome God, the judge of all!&endq; Such
were his la&s;t words: And the&s;e animated &s;peeches he
uttered with a voice and manner, which &s;truck all the
by&s;tanders with a&s;toni&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE &s;ettlement of Ireland after the re&s;toration was a
work of much greater difficulty than that of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Affairs of Ireland.</NOTE>
or of Scotland. Not only the power, during the
former u&s;urpations, had there been ve&s;ted in the King's
enemies: The whole property, in a manner, of the
kingdom had al&s;o been changed; and it became nece&s;|&s;ary
to redre&s;s, but with as little violence as po&s;&s;ible,
<PB N="455" REF="549">
many grievous hard&s;hips and iniquities, which were
there complained of.</P>
<P>THE Iri&s;h catholics had in 1648 concluded a treaty
with Ormond, the King's lieutenant; in which they
had &s;tipulated pardon for their pa&s;t rebellion, and had
engaged under certain conditions to a&s;&s;i&s;t the royal
cau&s;e: And though the violence of the prie&s;ts and the
bigotry of the people had prevented, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the execution of this treaty; yet were there many,
who, having &s;trictly, at the hazard of their lives, ad|hered
to it, &s;eemed on that account well entitled to reap
the fruits of their loyalty. Cromwel, having without
di&s;tinction expelled all the native Iri&s;h from the three
provinces of Mun&s;ter, Lein&s;ter, and Ul&s;ter, had con|fined
them to Connaught and the county of Clare; and
among tho&s;e who had thus been forfeited, were many
who&s;e innocence was altogether unque&s;tionable. Seve|ral
prote&s;tants likewi&s;e, and Ormond among the re&s;t,
had all along oppo&s;ed the Iri&s;h rebellion, yet having af|terwards
embraced the King's cau&s;e again&s;t the parli|ment,
they were all of them forfeited by the Protector.
And there were many officers, who had, from the com|mencement
of the in&s;urrection, &s;erved in Ireland, and
who, becau&s;e they would not de&s;ert the King, had been
refu&s;ed all their arrears by the Engli&s;h Common|wealth.</P>
<P>To all the&s;e unhappy &s;ufferers &s;ome ju&s;tice &s;eemed to
be due: But the difficulty was to find the means of re|dre&s;&s;ing
&s;uch great and exten&s;ive iniquities. Almo&s;t all
the valuable parts of Ireland had been mea&s;ured out and
divided, either to the adventurers, who had lent money
to the parliament for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the Iri&s;h rebel|lion,
or to the &s;oldiers, who had received land in lieu
of their arrears. The&s;e could not be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, be|cau&s;e
they were the mo&s;t powerful and only armed part
<PB N="456" REF="550">
of Ireland; becau&s;e it was requi&s;ite to favour them, in or|der
to &s;upport the Engli&s;h and prote&s;tant intere&s;t in that
kingdom; and becau&s;e they had generally, with a &s;eeming
zeal and alacrity, concurred in the King's re&s;toration.
The King, therefore, i&s;&s;ued a proclamation; in which
he promi&s;ed to maintain their &s;ettlement, and at the
&s;ame time engaged to give redre&s;s to the innocent &s;uf|ferers.
There was a large quantity of land as yet un|divided
in Ireland; and from this and &s;ome other funds,
it was thought po&s;&s;ible for the King to fulfil both the&s;e
engagements.</P>
<P>A COURT OF CLAIMS was erected, con&s;i&s;ting altoge|ther
of Engli&s;h commi&s;&s;ioners, who had no connexion
with, any of the parties, into which Ireland was divided.
Before the&s;e, were laid four thou&s;and claims of per&s;ons
de&s;iring re&s;titution on account of their innocence; and
the commi&s;&s;ioners had found lei&s;ure to examine only &s;ix
hundred. It already appeared, that, if all the&s;e were to
be re&s;tored, the funds, whence the adventurers and &s;ol|diers
mu&s;t get reprizals, would fall extremely &s;hort of
giving them any tolerable &s;atisfaction. A great alarm
and anxiety &s;eized all ranks of men: The hopes and
fears of every party were excited: The&s;e eagerly gra&s;ped
at recovering their paternal inheritance: Tho&s;e were
re&s;olute to maintain their new acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P>THE Duke of Ormond was created Lord-Lieutenant,
being the only per&s;on, who&s;e prudence and ju&s;tice could
compo&s;e &s;uch jarring intere&s;ts. A parliament was a&s;|&s;embled
at Dublin; and as the Lower Hou&s;e was al|mo&s;t
entirely cho&s;en by the &s;oldiers and adventurers,
who &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was extremely favourable to
that intere&s;t. The Hou&s;e of Peers &s;howed greater im|partiality.</P>
<P>AN in&s;urrection was projected, together with a &s;ur|prizal
of the ca&s;tle of Dublin, by &s;ome of the di&s;banded
<PB N="457" REF="551">
&s;oldiers; but this de&s;ign was happily defeated by the vi|gilance
of Ormond. Some of the criminals were pu|ni&s;hed.
Blood, the mo&s;t de&s;perate of them, e&s;caped
into England.</P>
<P>BUT affairs could not long remain in the confu&s;ion
and uncertainty, in which they were placed. All par|ties
&s;eemed willing to abate &s;omewhat of their preten|&s;ions,
in order to attain &s;ome &s;tability; and Ormond
interpo&s;ed his authority to that purpo&s;e. The &s;oldiers
and adventurers agreed to relinqui&s;h a third part of their
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and as they had purcha&s;ed their lands at very
low prices, they had rea&s;on to think them&s;elves ex|tremely
favoured by this compo&s;ition. All the per&s;ons,
forfeited on account of their adherence to the King,
were re&s;tored; and &s;ome of the innocent Iri&s;h. It was
a hard &s;ituation, that a man was obliged to prove him|&s;elf
innocent, in order to recover po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tate,
which he and his ance&s;tor had ever enjoyed: But the
hard&s;hip was augmented, by the difficult conditions an|nexed
to this proof. If the per&s;on had ever lived in
the quarters of the rebels, he was not admitted to plead
his innocence; and he was, for that rea&s;on alone, &s;up|po&s;ed
to have been a rebel. The enormous guilt of the
Iri&s;h nation made men overlook the more willingly any
iniquity, which might fall on individuals; and it was
con&s;idered, that though it be always the intere&s;t of all
good government to prevent inju&s;tice, it is not always
po&s;&s;ible to remedy it, after it has had a long cour&s;e, and
has been attended with great &s;ucce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IRELAND began to attain a &s;tate of &s;ome compo&s;ure,
when it was di&s;turbed by a very violent act, pa&s;&s;ed by
the Engli&s;h parliament, which prohibited the impor|tation
of Iri&s;h cattle into England<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1666.</NOTE>. Ormond remon|&s;trated
&s;trongly again&s;t this law. He &s;aid, that the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="458" REF="552">
trade, carried on between England and Ireland,
was extremely to the advantage of the former kingdom,
which received only provi&s;ions, or rude materials, and
&s;ent back in return every &s;pecies of manufacture: That
if the cattle of Ireland were prohibited, the inhabitants
of that i&s;land had no other commodity by which they
could pay England for their importations, and mu&s;t
have recour&s;e to other nations for a &s;upply: That the
indu&s;trious inhabitants of England, if deprived of Iri&s;h
provi&s;ions, which made living cheap, would be obliged
to augment the price of labour, and thereby render
their manufactures too dear to be exported to foreign
markets: That the lazy inhabitants of Ireland, finding
provi&s;ions fall almo&s;t to nothing, would never be in|duced
to labour, but would perpetuate to all genera|tions
their native &s;loth and barbari&s;m: That by cutting
off almo&s;t entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all
the natural bands of union were di&s;&s;olved, and nothing
remained to keep the Iri&s;h in their duty but force and
violence: And that by reducing that kingdom to ex|treme
poverty, it would be even rendered incapable of
maintaining that military power, by which, during its
well grounded di&s;contents, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be re|tained
in &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THE King was &s;o convinced of the ju&s;tne&s;s of the&s;e
rea&s;ons, that he u&s;ed all his intere&s;t to oppo&s;e the bill;
and he openly declared, that he could not give his a&s;|&s;ent
to it with a &s;afe con&s;cience. But the Commons
were re&s;olute in their purpo&s;e. Some of the rents of
England had fallen of late years, which had been a&s;|cribed
entirely to the importation of Iri&s;h cattle: Seve&s;|ral
intrigues had contributed to inflame that prejudice
particularly tho&s;e of Buckingham and A&s;hley, who were
de&s;irous of giving Ormond di&s;turbance in his govern
ment: And the &s;pirit of tyranny, of which nations an
as &s;u&s;ceptible as individuals, had animated the Engli&s;h
<PB N="459" REF="553">
extremely to exert their &s;uperiority over their dependant
&s;tate. No affair could be conducted with greater vio|lence
than this was by the Commons. They even
went &s;o &s;ar in the preamble of the bill as to declare
the importation of Iri&s;h cattle to be a <HI>nui&s;ance.</HI>
By this
expre&s;&s;ion, they gave &s;cope to their pa&s;&s;ion, and at the
&s;ame time barred the King's prerogative, by which he
might think him&s;elf entitled to di&s;pen&s;e with a law, &s;o
full of inju&s;tice and bad policy. The Lords expunged
the word; but as the King was &s;en&s;ible, that no &s;upply
would be given by the Commons, unle&s;s they were gra|tified
in all their prejudices, he was obliged both to em|ploy
his intere&s;t with the Peers for making the bill
pa&s;s, and to give the royal a&s;&s;ent to it. He could not,
however, forbear expre&s;&s;ing his di&s;plea&s;ure at the jea|lou&s;y
entertained again&s;t him, and at the intention,
which the Commons di&s;covered of retrenching his pre|rogative.</P>
<P>THIS law brought great di&s;tre&s;s for &s;ome time upon
Ireland; but it has occa&s;ioned their applying with
greater indu&s;try to manufactures, and has proved in the
i&s;&s;ue beneficial to that kingdom.</P>

<P>SINCE the re&s;toration,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXV.</NOTE> England was in a condi|tion, which had never been experienced in any
former period of her government, and which &s;eemed
the only one, that could fully en&s;ure her happine&s;s and
her liberty: The King was in continual want of &s;upply
from the parliament; and he &s;eemed willing to accom|modate
him&s;elf to that dependent &s;ituation. In&s;tead of
reviving tho&s;e claims of prerogative, &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in|&s;i&s;ted
on by his father and grandfather, he had &s;trictly
confined him&s;elf within the limits of law, and had
courted, by every art of popularity, the affections of his
&s;ubjects. Even the &s;everities, however blameable, which
he had been forced to exerci&s;e again&s;t nonconformi&s;ts,
are to be con&s;idered as expedients, by which he &s;trove
to ingratiate him&s;elf with that party, which predomi|nated
<PB N="461" REF="555">
in parliament. But notwith&s;tanding the&s;e pro|mi&s;ing
appearances, there were many circum&s;tances,
which kept the government from re&s;ting &s;teddily on that
bottom, on which it was placed. The crown having
lo&s;t almo&s;t all its antient deme&s;nes, relied entirely on
voluntary grants of the people; and the Commons, not
fully accu&s;tomed to this new &s;ituation, were not di&s;po&s;|ed
to &s;upply with &s;ufficient liberality the nece&s;&s;ities of
the crown. They imitated too &s;trictly the example of
their predece&s;&s;ors in a rigid frugality of public money;
and neither &s;ufficiently con&s;idered the indigent &s;ituation
of the Prince, nor the general &s;tate of Europe, where
every nation, by its increa&s;e both of magnificence and
$orce, had made great additions to all public expences.
Some con&s;iderable &s;ums, indeed, were be&s;towed on
Charles, and the patriots of that age, tenacious of an|$ient
maxims, loudly upbraided the Commons with pro|digality:
But if we may judge by the example of a later
period, when the government has become more regular,
and the harmony of its parts has been more happily ad|ju&s;ted,
the parliaments of this reign &s;eem rather to have
merited a contrary reproach.</P>
<P>THE natural con&s;equence of the poverty of the
crown was, be&s;ides feeble irregular tran&s;actions in
foreign affairs, a continual uncertainty in its dome&s;tic
admini&s;tration. No one could an&s;wer with any toler|able
a&s;&s;urance for the mea&s;ures of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons.
Few of the members were attached to the court
by any other band than that of inclination. Royali&s;ts
indeed in their principles, but unexperienced in bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
they lay expo&s;ed to every rumour or in&s;inuation;
and were driven by momentary gu&s;ts or currents, no
le&s;s than the populace them&s;elves. Even the attempts
made to gain an a&s;cendant over them, by offices, and,
as 'tis believed, by bribes and pen&s;ions, were apt to ope|rate
in a manner contrary to what was intended by
<PB N="462" REF="556">
the mini&s;ters. The novelty of the practice conveye$
a general, and indeed a ju&s;t, alarm; while at the &s;am$
time, the poverty of the crown rendered this influenc$
very limited and precarious.</P>
<P>THE character of Charles was ill fitted to remedy
tho&s;e defects in the con&s;titution. He acted in the ad|mini&s;tration
of public affairs, as if government were a
pa&s;time, rather than a &s;erious occupation; and by the
uncertainty of his conduct, he lo&s;t that authority, which
could alone be&s;tow con&s;tancy on the fluctuating re&s;olu|tions
of the parliament. His expences too, which al|ways
exceeded the proper bounds, were directed more
by inclination than by policy; and while they rendered
him continually dependant on the parliament, they were
not calculated &s;o as fully to &s;atisfy either the intere&s;ted

<P>THE parliament met after a long adjournment;<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of Fe|bruary. A parliament.</NOTE> and
the King promi&s;ed him&s;elf every thing from the at|tachment
of the Commons. All his late mea&s;ures had
been calculated to acquire the good will of his people;
and above all, the triple league, it was hoped, would
be able to efface all the impre&s;&s;ions left by the unhappy
conclu&s;ion of the Dutch war. But a new attempt
made by the court, and a very laudable one too, lo&s;t
him, for a time, the effect of all the&s;e endeavours.
Buckingham, who was in great favour with the King$
and carried on many intrigues among the Commons$
had al&s;o endeavoured to &s;upport connexions with the
nonconformi&s;ts; and he now formed a &s;cheme, toge|ther
with the Lord Keeper, Sir Orlando Bridgeman, and
Sir Mathew Hale, Chief Ju&s;tice, two worthy patriots, to
put an end to tho&s;e &s;everities, under which the&s;e religio|ni&s;ts
had &s;o long laboured. It was propo&s;ed to reconcil$
the pre&s;byterians by a comprehen&s;ion, and to grant$
toleration to the independants and other &s;ectaries$
Favour &s;eems not, by this &s;cheme, as by others em|braced

during the pre&s;ent reign, to have been intended
the catholics: Yet were the zealous Commons &s;o di&s;|gu&s;ted,
that they could not be prevailed on even to
give the King thanks for the triple league, however
laudable that mea&s;ure was then, and has ever &s;ince been
e&s;teemed. They immediately voted an addre&s;s for a
proclamation again&s;t conventicles. Their reque&s;t was
complied with; but as the King &s;till dropped &s;ome
hints of his de&s;ire to reconcile his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects,
the Commons pa&s;&s;ed a very unu&s;ual vote, that no man
&s;hould bring into the Hou&s;e any bill of that nature.
The King in vain re-iterated his &s;ollicitations for &s;up|ply,
repre&s;ented the nece&s;&s;ity of equipping a fleet, and
even offered, that the money which they &s;hould grant,
&s;hould be collected and i&s;&s;ued for that purpo&s;e by commi&s;|&s;ioners
appointed by the Hou&s;e. In&s;tead of compliance,
the Commons voted an enquiry into all the mi&s;carriages
during the late war; the &s;lackening $ail after the Duke's
victory from fal&s;e orders delivered by Brounker, the
mi&s;carriage at Berghen, the divi&s;ion of the fleet under
Prince Rupert and Albemarle, the di&s;grace at Chatham.
Brounker was expelled the Hou&s;e, and ordered to be
impeached. Commi&s;&s;ioner Pet, who had neglected or|ders
for the &s;ecurity of Chatham, met with the &s;ame
fate. The&s;e impeachments were never pro&s;ecuted. The
Hou&s;e at la&s;t, having been indulged in all their preju|dices,
were prevailed with to vote the King three hun|dred
and ten thou&s;and pounds, by an impo&s;ition on
wine and other liquors; after which they were ad|journed.</P>
<P>Public bu&s;ine&s;s, be&s;ides being retarded by the di&s;gu&s;t of
the Commons again&s;t the tolerating maxims of the court,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of May.</NOTE>
received ob&s;tructions this &s;e&s;&s;ion from a quarrel between
the two Hou&s;es. Skinner, a rich merchant in Lon|don,
having met with &s;ome injuries from the Ea&s;t India
Company, laid the matter by petition before the Hou&s;e
<PB N="464" REF="558">
of Lords, by whom he was relieved in co&s;ts and dam|ages
to the amount of five thou&s;and pounds. The
Commons voted, that the Lords, in taking cognizance
of this affair, originally, without any appeal from in|ferior
courts, had acted in a manner not agreeable to the
laws of the land, and tending to deprive the &s;ubject of
the right, ea&s;e, and benefit, due to him by the&s;e laws;
and that Skinner, in pro&s;ecuting the &s;uit, had infringed
the privileges of the Commons: For which offence,
they ordered him to be taken into the cu&s;tody of the
Serjeant at Arms. Some conferences en&s;ued between
the Hou&s;es; where the Lords were tenacious of their
right of judicature, and maintained, that the method,
in which they had exerci&s;ed it was quite regular. The
Commons ro&s;e into a great &s;erment; and went &s;o far as
to vote, that &startq;whoever &s;hould be aiding or a&s;&s;i&s;ting in
putting in execution the order or &s;entence of the
Hou&s;e of Lords, in the ca&s;e of Skinner again&s;t the
Ea&s;t India Company, &s;hall be deemed a betrayer of
the rights and liberties of the Commons of England,
and an infringer of the privileges of the Hou&s;e of
Commons.&endq; They rightly judged, that it would not
be ea&s;y, after this vote, to find any one, who would
venture on their indignation. The proceedings indeed
of the Lords &s;eem in this ca&s;e to have been unu&s;ual and
without precedent.</P>
<P>THE King's nece&s;&s;ities obliged him again to a&s;&s;emble
the parliament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1669.</NOTE> who &s;howed &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to relieve
him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of Oc-</NOTE> The price, however, which he mu&s;t pay for this
indulgence, was his yielding to laws again&s;t conventicles.
His complia&s;ance in this particular contributed more to
gain the Commons, than all the pompous pretences of
&s;upporting the triple alliance, that popular mea&s;ure, by
which he expected to make &s;uch advantage. The quar|rel
between the two Hou&s;es was revived; and as the
<PB N="465" REF="559">
Commons had voted only four hundred thou&s;and pounds,
with which the King was not &s;atisfied, he thought pro|per,
before they had carried their vote into a law, to
prorogue them. The only bu&s;ine&s;s fini&s;hed this &s;hort<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of De|cember,</NOTE>
&s;e&s;&s;ion was the receiving the report of the committee
appointed for examining the public accounts. On the
fir&s;t in&s;pection of this report, there appears a va&s;t &s;um,
no le&s;s than a million and a half, unaccounted for; and
the natural inference is, that the King had very much
abu&s;ed the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him by parliament. But a
more accurate in&s;pection of particulars &s;erves, in a great
mea&s;ure, to remove this imputation. The King indeed
went &s;o far as to tell the parliament from the throne,
&startq;That he had fully informed him&s;elf of that matter,
and did affirm, that no part of tho&s;e monies, which
they had given him, had been diverted to other u&s;es,
but on the contrary, be&s;ides all tho&s;e &s;upplies, a very
great &s;um had been rai&s;ed out of his &s;tanding reve|nue
and credit, and a very great debt contracted;
and all for the war.&endq; Though artificial pretences
have often been employed by Kings in their &s;peeches to
parliament, and by none more than Charles, it is &s;ome|what
difficult to &s;u&s;pect him of a direct lie and fal&s;hood.
He mu&s;t have had &s;ome rea&s;ons, and perhaps not un|plau&s;ible
ones, for this affirmation, of which all his
hearers, as they had the accounts lying before them,
were at that time very competent judges<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The ab&s;tract of the report of the Brook-hou&s;e committee (&s;o that com|mittee was called) was fir&s;t publi&s;hed by Mr. Ralph, vol. i. p. 177, from Lord Hallifax's Collections, to which I refer. If we peru&s;e their apology, which we find in the &s;ub&s;equent page of the &s;ame author, we &s;hall find, that they acted with &s;ome malignity towards the King. They would take notice of no &s;ervices performed before the 1&s;t of September, 1664. But all the King's preparations preceded that date, and, as Chancellor Clarendon told the parliament, amounted to eight hundred thou&s;and pounds; and the computa|tion is very probable. This &s;um, therefore, mu&s;t be added. The com|mittee likewi&s;e charged &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds to the King on ac|count of the winter and &s;ummer guards, &s;aved during two years and ten months that the war la&s;ted. But this &s;eems inquitous. For though that was an u&s;ual burthen on the revenue, which was then &s;aved; would not the dimi|nution of the cu&s;toms during the war be an equivalent to it? Be&s;ides, near three hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds are charged for prize-money, which perhaps the King thought he ought not to account for. The&s;e &s;ums exceed the million and a half.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="466" REF="560">
THE method which all parliaments had hitherto fol|lowed,
was to vote a particular &s;um for the &s;upply,
without any di&s;tinction or appropriation for particular &s;er|vices.
So long as the demands of the crown were only
&s;mall and ca&s;ual, no great inconveniencies aro&s;e from
this practice. But as all the mea&s;ures of government
were now changed, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that, if the
King made a ju&s;t application of public money, this in|accurate
method of proceeding, by expo&s;ing him to &s;u&s;|picions,
was very prejudicial to him. If he was inclined
to act otherwi&s;e, it was equally hurtful to the people.
For the&s;e rea&s;ons, a contrary practice, during all the
late reigns, has con&s;tantly been followed by the Com|mons.</P>
<P>WHEN the parliament met after the prorogation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1670.</NOTE> they
entered anew upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;upply,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> and
granted the King an additional duty, during eight
years, of twelve pounds on each tun of Spani&s;h wine,
eight on each tun of French. A law was al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed
empowering him to &s;ell the fee farm rents; the la&s;t re|mains
of the deme&s;nes by which the antient Kings of
England had been &s;upported. By this expedient he
obtained &s;ome &s;upply for his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, but le$t
the crown, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more dependant than before.
How much money might be rai&s;ed by the&s;e &s;ales is un|certain;
but it could not be near one million eight hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds, the &s;um a&s;&s;igned by &s;ome writers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Mrs Carte, in his Vindication of the An&s;wer to the By&s;tander, p. 99, &s;ays, that the &s;ale of the fee farm rents would not yield above one hun|dred thou&s;and pounds; and his rea&s;ons appear well founded.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="467" REF="561">
THE act again&s;t conventicles pa&s;&s;ed, and received the
royal a&s;&s;ent. It bears the appearance of mitigating the
former per&s;ecuting laws; but if we may judge by the
&s;pirit, which had broke out almo&s;t every &s;e&s;&s;ion during
this parliament, it was not intended as any favour to
the nonconformi&s;ts. 'Twas probably found by expe|rience,
that laws over rigid and &s;evere could not be
executed. By this act the hearer in a conventicle, (that
is, in a di&s;&s;enting a&s;&s;embly, where more than five were
pre&s;ent, be&s;ides the family) was fined five &s;hillings for the
fir&s;t offence, ten for the &s;econd; the preacher twenty
pounds for the fir&s;t offence; forty for the &s;econd. The
per&s;on, in who&s;e hou&s;e the conventicle met, forfeited a like
&s;um with the preacher. One clau&s;e is very remarkable;
that, if any di&s;pute &s;hould ari&s;e with regard to the in|terpretation
of any part of the act, the Judges &s;hould
always explain the doubt in the &s;en&s;e lea&s;t favourable to
conventicles, it being the intention of the parliament
entirely to &s;uppre&s;s them. Such was the zeal of the
Commons, that they violated the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
maxims of civil policy, which require, that, in
all criminal pro&s;ecutions, favour &s;hould always be given
to the pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>THE affair of Skinner &s;till remained a ground of
quarrel between the two Hou&s;es; but the King pre|vailed
with the Peers to accept of the expedient pro|po&s;ed
by the Commons, that a general razure &s;hould be
made of all the tran&s;actions with regard to that di&s;put|ed
que&s;tion.</P>
<P>SOME attempts were made by the King to effectuate
a union between England and Scotland: But they were
too feeble to remove all the difficulties, which ob&s;truct|ed
that u&s;eful and important undertaking. Commi&s;&s;io|ners
were appointed to meet, in order to regulate the
conditions: But the de&s;ign, chiefly by the intrigues of
Lauderdale, &s;oon after came to nothing.</P>
<P><PB N="468" REF="562">
THE KING, about this time, began frequently to at|tend
the debates of the Hou&s;e of Peers. He &s;aid, that they
amu&s;ed him, and that he found them no le&s;s entertain|ing
than a play. But deeper de&s;igns were &s;u&s;pected.
As he &s;eemed to intere&s;t him&s;elf extremely in the cau&s;e
of Lord Roos, who had obtained a divorce from his
wife on the accu&s;ation of adultery, and applied to par|liament
for leave to marry again; people imagined,
that Charles propo&s;ed to make a precedent of the ca&s;e,
and that &s;ome other pretence would be found for getting
rid of the Queen. Many propo&s;als to this purpo&s;e, it
is &s;aid, were made him by Buckingham: But the King,
however little &s;crupulous in &s;ome re&s;pects, was incap|able
of any action har&s;h or barbarous; and he always
rejected with horror all &s;chemes of this nature. A &s;u&s;|picion
however of &s;uch intentions, it was ob&s;erved,
had, at this time, begot a coldne&s;s between the two
royal brothers.</P>
<P>WE now come to a period, when the King's coun|cils,
which had hitherto, in the main, been good, tho'
negligent and fluctuating, became, during &s;ome time,
remarkably bad, or even criminal; and breeding in|curable
jealou&s;ies in all men, were followed by &s;uch
con&s;equences as had almo&s;t terminated in the ruin both
of Prince and people. Happily the &s;ame negligence &s;till
attended him, and, as it had le&s;&s;ened the influence of
the good, it al&s;o dimini&s;hed the effect of the bad mea|&s;ures,
which he embraced.</P>
<P>IT was remarked, that the committee of council,
e&s;tabli&s;hed for foreign affairs, was entirely changed;
and that Prince Rupert, the Duke of Ormond, Secre|tary
Trevor, and Lord Keeper Bridgeman, men in
who&s;e honour the nation had great confidence, were
never called to any deliberations. The whole &s;ecret
was entru&s;ted to five per&s;ons, Clifford, A&s;hley, Buck|ingham,
<PB N="469" REF="563">
A$lington, Lauderdale. The&s;e men were
known by the appellation of the Cabal, a word which
the initial letters of their names happened to compo&s;e.
Never was there a more dangerous mini&s;try in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Cabal.</NOTE>
nor one more noted for pernicious councils.</P>
<P>LORD ASHLEY, &s;oon after known by the name of
Earl of Shafte&s;bury,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their cha|racters.</NOTE> was one of the mo&s;t remarkable
characters of the age, and the chief &s;pring of all the
&s;ucceeding movements. During his early youth, he
had engaged in the late King's party; but being di&s;|gu&s;ted
with &s;ome mea&s;ures of Prince Maurice, he &s;oon
de&s;erted to the parliament. He in&s;inuated him&s;elf into
the confidence of Cromwel; and as he had great in|fluence
on the pre&s;byterians, he was &s;erviceable in &s;up|porting
the authority of that u&s;urper. He employed
the &s;ame credit to promote the re&s;toration; and on that
account both de&s;erved and acquired great favour with
the King. In all his changes, he &s;till maintained the
character of never betraying tho&s;e friends whom he de|&s;erted;
and which ever party he joined, his great ca|pacity
and &s;ingular talents &s;oon gained him their confi|dence,
and enabled him to take the lead among them.
No &s;tation could &s;atisfy his ambition, no fatigues were
in&s;uperable to his indu&s;try. Well-acquainted with the
blind attachment of parties, he &s;urmounted all &s;en&s;e of
&s;hame: And relying on the &s;ubtilty of his contrivances,
he was not &s;tartled with enterprizes, the mo&s;t hazar|dous
and mo&s;t criminal. His talents, both of public
&s;peaking and private in&s;inuation, &s;hone out in an emi|nent
degree; and amid&s;t all his furious pa&s;&s;ions, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
a found judgment of bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;till more of
men. Though fitted by nature for beginning and
pu&s;hing the greate&s;t undertakings, he was never able
to conduct any to a happy period; and his eminent abi|lities,
by rea&s;on of his in&s;atiable de&s;ires, were equally
dangerous to him&s;elf, to the Prince, and to the people$</P>
<P><PB N="470" REF="564">
THE Duke of Buckingham po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the advant|ages,
which a graceful per&s;on, a high rank, a &s;plendid
fortune, and a lively wit could be&s;tow; but by his wild
conduct, unre&s;trained either by prudence or principle,
he found means to render him&s;elf in the end odious and
even in&s;ignificant. The lea&s;t intere&s;t could make him
abandon his honour; the &s;malle&s;t plea&s;ure could &s;educe
him from his intere&s;t; the mo&s;t frivolous caprice was
&s;ufficient to counterballance his plea&s;ure. By the want
of &s;ecrecy and con&s;tancy, he de&s;troyed his character in
public life; by the contempt of order and oeconomy,
he di&s;&s;ipated his private fortune; by riot and debauchery,
he ruined his health; and he remained at la&s;t as inca|pable
of doing hurt, as he had ever been little de&s;irous
of doing good, to mankind.</P>
<P>THE Earl, &s;oon after created Duke, of Lauderdale,
was not defective in natural, and &s;till le&s;s in acquired,
talents; but neither was his addre&s;s graceful, nor his
under&s;tanding ju&s;t. His principles, or, more properly
&s;peaking, his prejudices, were ob&s;tinate, but unable to
re&s;train his ambition: His ambition was &s;till le&s;s dan|gerous
than the tyranny and violence of his temper.
An implacable enemy, but a lukewarm friend; in&s;olent
to his inferiors, but abject to his &s;uperiors; though in
his whole character and deportment, he was almo&s;t dia|metrically
oppo&s;ite to the King, he had the fortune,
beyond any other mini&s;ter, to maintain, during the
greate&s;t part of his reign, an a&s;cendant over him.</P>
<P>THE talents of parliamentary eloquence and intrigue
had rai&s;ed Sir Thomas Clifford; and his daring impe|tuous
&s;pirit gave him weight in the King's councils.
Of the whole Cabal, Arlington was the lea&s;t dangerous
either by his vices or his talents. His judgment was
&s;ound, though his capacity was but moderate; and his
intentions were good, though he wanted courage and
<PB N="471" REF="565">
integrity to per&s;evere in them. Together with Temple
and Bridgeman, he had been a great promoter of the
triple league; but he threw him&s;elf with equal alacrity
into oppo&s;ite mea&s;ures, when he found them agreeable to
his ma&s;ter. Clifford and he were &s;ecretly catholics:
Shafte&s;bury, though addicted to a&s;trology, was reckon|ed
a dei&s;t: Buckingham had too little reflection to em|brace
any &s;teady principles: Lauderdale had long been
a bigotted and furious pre&s;byterian; and the opinions
of that &s;ect &s;till kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his mind, however
little they appeared in his conduct.</P>
<P>THE dark councils of the Cabal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their coun|cils.</NOTE> though from the
fir&s;t they gave anxiety to all men of reflection, were
not thoroughly known but by the event. Such &s;eem
to have been the views, which they &s;ugge&s;ted to the
King and the Duke, and which the&s;e Princes too
greedily embraced. They &s;aid, that the parliament,
though the &s;pirit of party, for the pre&s;ent, attached
them to the crown, were &s;till more attached to tho&s;e
powers and privileges, which their predece&s;&s;ors had
u&s;urped from the Sovereign: That after the fir&s;t flow
of kindne&s;s, they had di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of di&s;con|tent;
and would be &s;ure to turn again&s;t the King all
the authority which they yet retained, and &s;till more
tho&s;e preten&s;ions which it was ea&s;y for them in a mo|ment
to revive: That they not only kept the King in
dependance by means of his precarious revenue, but
had never di&s;covered a &s;uitable genero&s;ity, even in tho&s;e
temporary &s;upplies, which they granted him: That it
was time for the Prince to rouze him&s;elf from his le|thargy,
and to recover that authority, which his prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
during &s;o many ages, had peaceably enjoyed:
That the great error or misfortune of his father was the
not having formed any clo&s;e connexion with foreign
Princes, who, on the breaking out of the rebellion,
might have found their intere&s;t in &s;upporting him:
<PB N="472" REF="566">
That the pre&s;ent alliances, being entered into with &s;o
many weaker potentates, who them&s;elves &s;tood in need
of the King's protection, could never &s;erve to maintain,
much le&s;s augment, the royal authority: That the
French monarch alone, &s;o generous a Prince, and by
blood &s;o nearly allied to the King, would be found
both able and willing, if gratified in his ambition, to
defend the common cau&s;e of Kings again&s;t u&s;urping
&s;ubjects: That a war, undertaken again&s;t Holland by
the united force of two &s;uch mighty potentates, would
prove an ea&s;y enterprize, and would &s;erve all the pur|po&s;es
which were aimed at: That under pretence of that
war, it would not be difficult to levy a military force,
without which, during the prevalence of republican
principles among his &s;ubjects, the King would vainly
expect to defend his prerogative: That his naval power
might be maintained, partly by the &s;upplies, which, on
other pretences, would previou&s;ly be obtained from par|liament;
partly by &s;ub&s;idies from France; partly by cap|tures,
which might ea&s;ily be made on that opulent re|public:
That in &s;uch a &s;ituation, attempts to recover
the lo&s;t authority of the crown would be attended with
&s;ucce&s;s; not would any malecontents dare to re&s;i&s;t a
Prince, fortified by &s;o powerful an alliance; or if they
did, they would only draw more certain ruin on them|&s;elves
and on their cau&s;e: And that by &s;ubduing the
States, a great &s;tep would be taken towards advancing a
reformation of the government; &s;ince it was apparent,
that that republic, by its fame and grandeur, fortified,
in his factious &s;ubjects, their attachment to what they
vainly called their civil and religious liberties.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ugge&s;tions happened fatally to concur with
all the inclinations and prejudices of the King; his
de&s;ire of more exten&s;ive authority, his propen&s;ity to the
catholic religion, his avidity for money. He &s;eems
likewi&s;e, from the very beginning of his reign, to have
<PB N="473" REF="567">
entertained great jealou&s;y of his own &s;ubjects, and, on
that account, a de&s;ire of fortifying him&s;elf by an inti|mate
alliance with France. So early as 1664, he had
offered the French monarch to allow him without op|po&s;ition
to conquer Flanders, provided that Prince
would engage to furni&s;h him with ten thou&s;and infan|try,
and a &s;uitable number of cavalry, in ca&s;e of any
rebellion in England<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'E&s;trades, 21&s;t of July, 1667.</NOTE>. As no dangerous &s;ymptoms at
that time di&s;covered them&s;elves, we are left to conjec|ture,
from this incident, what opinion Charles had
conceived of the factious di&s;po&s;ition of his people.</P>
<P>EVEN during the time, when the triple alliance was
mo&s;t zealou&s;ly cultivated, the King never &s;eems to
have been entirely cordial in tho&s;e &s;alutary mea&s;ures,
but &s;till to have ca&s;t a longing eye towards the French
alliance. Clifford, who had much of his confidence,
&s;aid imprudently, &startq;Notwith&s;tanding all this joy, we
mu&s;t have a &s;econd war with Holland.&endq; The acce&s;|&s;ion
of the Emperor to that alliance had been refu&s;ed
by England on very frivolous pretences. And many
unfriendly cavils were rai&s;ed again&s;t the States with re|gard
to Surinam and the conduct of the Ea&s;t India
Company. But about April 1669, the &s;tronge&s;t &s;ymp|toms
appeared of tho&s;e fatal mea&s;ures, which were after|wards
more openly pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>DE WIT, at that time, came to Temple; and told
him, that he payed him a vi&s;it as a friend, not as a mi|ni&s;ter.
The occa&s;ion was to acquaint him with a con|ver&s;ation
which he had lately had with Puffendorf, the
Swedi&s;h agent, who had pa&s;&s;ed by the Hague in the
way from Paris to his own country. The French mi|ni&s;ters,
Puffendorf &s;aid, had taken much pains to per|&s;uade
him, that the Swedes would find their account very
ill in tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which they had lately embraced:
That Spain would fail them in all her promi&s;es of &s;ub|&s;idies;
<PB N="474" REF="568">
nor would Holland alone be able to &s;upport
them: That England would certainly fail them, and
had already adopted councils directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e
which by the triple league &s;he had bound her&s;elf to pur|&s;ue:
And that the re&s;olution was not the le&s;s fixed and
certain, that the &s;ecret was as yet communicated to ve|ry
$ew either in the French or Engli&s;h court. When
Puffendorf &s;eemed incredulous, Turenne &s;howed him a
letter from Colbert de Croi&s;&s;y, the French mini&s;ter at
London; where, after mentioning the &s;ucce&s;s of his
negotiations, and the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of the chief
mini&s;ters there, he added, &startq;And I have at la&s;t made
them &s;en&s;ible of the whole extent of his Maje&s;ty's
bounty<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. ii. p. 179.</NOTE>.&endq; From this incident it appears, that the
infamous practice of &s;elling them&s;elves to foreign
Princes, a practice, which, notwith&s;tanding the ma|lignity
of the vulgar, is certainly very rare among
men in high office, had not been &s;crupled by Charles's
mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>BUT the King's re&s;olutions &s;eem never to have been
entirely fixed, till the vi&s;it which he received from his
&s;i&s;ter, the Dutche&s;s of Orleans. Lewis, knowing the
addre&s;s and in&s;inuation of that amiable Prince&s;s, and the
great influence which &s;he had obtained over her brother,
had engaged her to employ all her good offices, in or|der
to detach England from the triple league, which,
he knew, had fixed &s;uch an un&s;urmountable barrier to
his ambition. That he might the better cover this ne|gotiation,
he pretended to vi&s;it his frontiers, particularly
the great works which he had undertaken at Dunkirk;
and he carried the Queen and the whole court along
with him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of May</NOTE> While he remained on the oppo&s;ite &s;hore,
the Dutche&s;s of Orleans went over into England; and
Charles met her at Dover, where they pa&s;&s;ed ten days
together in great mirth and fe&s;tivity. By her artifices
<PB N="475" REF="569">
and care&s;&s;es, &s;he prevailed on Charles to relinqui&s;h the
mo&s;t &s;ettled maxims of honour and policy, and to fi|ni&s;h
his engagements with Lewis for the de&s;truction of
Holland. No particular articles &s;eem here to have been
&s;igned, or even agreed upon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Alliance with France.</NOTE> Neither of the Princes
had the lea&s;t claims on that republic; and they could
therefore regulate their preten&s;ions only by the future
&s;ucce&s;s of their arms. And as to the &s;cheme, which
Charles is with &s;o good rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed to have enter|tained,
of employing the French power, or at lea&s;t the
terror of it, for enlarging his authority at home; it
was of &s;uch a nature as mu&s;t depend upon incidents,
and, for the pre&s;ent, it &s;ufficed, if he conjoined his in|tere&s;ts
intimately with France, and obtained general
a&s;&s;urances of &s;upport, in ca&s;e of any oppo&s;ition or in|&s;urrection.</P>
<P>BUT Lewis well knew Charles's character, and the
u&s;ual fluctuation of his councils. In order to fix him in
the French intere&s;ts, he re&s;olved to bind him by the
tyes of plea&s;ure, the only ones which with him were
irre&s;i&s;tible; and he made him a pre&s;ent of a French
mi&s;tre&s;s, by who&s;e means he hoped, for the future, to
govern him. The Dutche&s;s of Orleans brought with
her a young lady of the name of Quero&uuml;aille, whom the
King carried to London, and &s;oon after created Dutche&s;s
of Port&s;mouth. He was extremely attached to her du|ring
the whole cour&s;e of his life; and &s;he proved a
great means of &s;upporting his connections with her na|tive
country. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible but his quick di&s;cern|ment
mu&s;t have perceived the &s;cope of all the&s;e artifices;
but he was too much a &s;lave to plea&s;ure, ever to de|fend
him&s;elf again&s;t its pre&s;ent allurements.</P>
<P>The &s;atisfaction which Charles reaped from his new
alliance, received a great check by the death of his
&s;i&s;ter, and &s;till more by tho&s;e melancholy circum&s;tances
<PB N="476" REF="570">
which attended it. Her death was &s;udden, after a few
days illne&s;s; and &s;he was &s;eized with the malady upon
drinking a gla&s;s of &s;uccory-water. Strong &s;u&s;picions of
poi&s;on aro&s;e in the court of France, and &s;pread all over
Europe; and as her hu&s;band had di&s;covered many &s;ymp|toms
of jealou&s;y and di&s;content on account of her con|duct,
he was univer&s;ally believed to be the author of
that crime. Charles him&s;elf, during &s;ome time, was
entirely convinced of his guilt; but upon receiving the
atte&s;tation of phy&s;icians, who, on opening her body,
found no foundation for the general rumour, he was,
or pretended to be &s;atisfied. The Duke of Orleans in|deed
did never, in any other circum&s;tance of his life,
betray &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as might lead him to &s;o criminal
an action; and a lady, it is &s;aid, drank the remains of
the &s;ame gla&s;s, without feeling any inconvenience. The
&s;udden death of Princes is commonly accompanied with
the&s;e di&s;mal $urmi&s;es; and therefore le&s;s weight is in
this ca&s;e to be laid on the &s;u&s;picions of the public.</P>
<P>CHARLES, in&s;tead of breaking with France upon this
incident, took advantage of it to &s;end over Buckingham,
under pretence of condoling with the Duke of Orleans,
but in reality to concert farther mea&s;ures for the pro|jected
war. Never amba&s;&s;ador received greater care&s;&s;es.
The more de&s;tructive the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures were to the
intere&s;ts of England, the more natural was it for Lewis
to load with civilities, and even with favours, tho&s;e
whom he could engage to promote them.</P>
<P>THE journey of Buckingham rai&s;ed &s;trong &s;u&s;picions
in Holland, which every circum&s;tance tended &s;till farther
to confirm. Lewis made a &s;udden irruption into Lor|raine;
and though he mi&s;&s;ed &s;eizing the Duke him&s;elf,
who had no &s;urmi&s;e of the danger, and who very nar|rowly
e&s;caped, he was &s;oon able, without re&s;i&s;tance, to
make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the whole country. The French
<PB N="477" REF="571">
monarch was &s;o far unhappy, that, though the mo&s;t
tempting opportunities offered them&s;elves, he had not
commonly &s;o much as the pretence of equity and ju&s;|tice
to cover his ambitious mea&s;ures. This acqui&s;ition
of Lorraine ought to have excited the jealou&s;y of the
contracting powers in the triple league, as much as an
inva&s;ion of Flanders it&s;elf; yet did Charles turn a deaf
ear to all remon&s;trances which were made him upon
that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT what tended chiefly to open the eyes of de Wit
and the States, with regard to the mea&s;ures of England,
was the &s;udden recal of Sir William Temple. That
mini&s;ter had &s;o firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed his character of ho|nour
and integrity, that he was believed incapable even
of obeying his ma&s;ter's commands, in promoting mea|&s;ures
which he e&s;teemed pernicious to his country; and
&s;o long as he remained in employment, de Wit thought
him&s;elf a&s;&s;ured of the fidelity of England. Charles was
&s;o &s;en&s;ible of this prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that he ordered Temple
to leave his family at the Hague, and pretended that
that mini&s;ter would immediately return, after having
conferred with the King about &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, where his
negotiation had met with ob&s;tructions. De Wit made
the Dutch re&s;ident inform the Engli&s;h court, that he
would con&s;ider the recal of Temple as an expre&s;s de|claration
of a change of mea&s;ures in England; and
would even know what interpretation to put upon any
delay of his return.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e mea&s;ures were &s;ecretly in agitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of Oc|tober. A parliament</NOTE> the
parliament met, according to adjournment. The King
made a very &s;hort &s;peech, and left the bu&s;ine&s;s to be
enlarged upon by the keeper. That mini&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted
much on the King's great want of &s;upply; the mighty
increa&s;e of the naval power of France, now triple to
what it was before the la&s;t war with Holland; the de|cay
<PB N="478" REF="572">
of the Engli&s;h navy&punc; the nece&s;&s;ity of fitting out
next year a fleet of fifty &s;ail; the obligations which the
King lay under by &s;everal treaties to exert him&s;elf for
the common good of chri&s;tendom. Among other trea|ties,
he mentioned the triple alliance, and the defen&s;ive
league with the &s;tates. It is certain, that Bridgeman,
though he was not admitted into the &s;ecrets of the ca|bal,
mu&s;t have ob&s;erved &s;o many grounds of &s;u&s;picion,
as &s;hould have kept him from giving &s;anction to that
deceit, which was intended to be put upon the par|liament.</P>
<P>THE artifice &s;ucceeded. The Hou&s;e of Commons,
entirely &s;atisfied with the King's mea&s;ures, voted him
con&s;iderable &s;upplies. A land tax for a year was im|po&s;ed
of a &s;hilling a pound; two &s;hillings a pound on
two thirds of the &s;alaries of offices; fifteen &s;hillings on
every hundred pound of bankers' money and &s;tock; an
additional exci&s;e upon beer for &s;ix years, and certain
impo&s;itions upon law proceedings for nine years. The
parliament had never before been in a more liberal di&s;|po&s;ition;
and never &s;urely was it le&s;s merited by the
councils of the King and of his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>THE Commons pa&s;&s;ed another bill for laying a duty
on tobacco, Scots &s;alt, gla&s;&s;es, and &s;ome other commo|dities.
Again&s;t this bill the merchants of London ap|peared
by petition before the Hou&s;e of Lords. The
Lords entered into their rea&s;ons, and began to make
amendments on the bill &s;ent up by the Commons. This
attempt was highly re&s;ented by the lower hou&s;e, as an
encroachment on the right, which they pretended to
po&s;&s;e&s;s alone, of granting money to the crown. Many
remon&s;trances pa&s;&s;ed between the two hou&s;es; and by
their altercations the King was obliged to prorogue the
parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1671.</NOTE> and he thereby lo&s;t the money which was
intended him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of April.</NOTE> This is the la&s;t time that the Peers have
<PB N="479" REF="573">
revived any preten&s;ions of that nature. Ever &s;ince, the
privilege of the Commons, in all other places, except
the Hou&s;e of Peers, has pa&s;&s;ed for undi&s;puted.</P>
<P>THERE was a private affair, which during this &s;e&s;&s;ion
di&s;gu&s;ted the Hou&s;e of Commons, and required &s;ome
pains to accommodate it. The u&s;ual method of tho&s;e
who oppo&s;ed the court in the money bills, was, if they
failed in the main vote, as to the extent of the &s;upply,
to levy the money from &s;uch funds as they expected
would be unacceptable, or would prove deficient. It
was propo&s;ed to lay an impo&s;ition upon playhou&s;es:
The courtiers objected, that the players were the King's
&s;ervants, and a part of his plea&s;ure. Sir John Coventry,
a gentleman of the country party, a&s;ked, &startq;whether the
King's plea&s;ure lay among the male or the female
players?&endq; This &s;troke of &s;atire was aimed at
Charles, who, be&s;ides his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of higher quality,
entertained at that time two actre&s;&s;es, Davis and Nell
Gwin. The King received not the raillery with that
good humour which might have been expected. It was
&s;aid, that this being the fir&s;t time, when re&s;pect to Ma|je&s;ty
had been publicly violated, it was nece&s;&s;ary, by
&s;ome &s;evere cha&s;ti&s;ement, to make Coventry an example
to all who might incline to tread in his foot&s;teps.
Sands, Obrian, and &s;ome others of the guards, were
ordered to way-lay him, and to &s;et a mark upon him.
He defended him&s;elf with great bravery, and after
wounding &s;everal of the a&s;&s;ailants, was with &s;ome
difficulty di&s;armed. They cut his no&s;e to the bone,
in order, as they &s;aid, to teach him what re&s;pect he
owed to the King. The Commons were enflamed by
this indignity offered to one of their members, on ac|count
of words &s;poke in the hou&s;e. They pa&s;&s;ed a
law,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coventry act</NOTE> where they made it capital to maim any per&s;on;
and they enacted, that tho&s;e criminals who had a&s;&s;aulted
<PB N="480" REF="574">
Coventry, &s;hould be incapable of receiving a pardon
from the crown.</P>
<P>THERE was another private affair tran&s;acted about
this time, by which the King was as much expo&s;ed to
the imputation of a capricious lenity, as he was here
blamed for unnece&s;&s;ary &s;everity. Blood, a di&s;banded of|ficer
of the Protector, had been engaged in the con&s;pi|racy
for rai&s;ing an in&s;urrection in Ireland; and for this
crime he him&s;elf had been attainted, and &s;ome of his
accomplices capitally puni&s;hed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Blood's crimes.</NOTE> The daring villain me|ditated
a revenge upon Ormond, the Lord Lieutenant.
Having by artifice drawn off the Duke's footmen, he
attacked his coach in the night, as he drove along St.
James's &s;treet in London, and made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
his per&s;on. He might here have fini&s;hed the crime,
had he not meditated re&s;inements in his vengeance:
He was re&s;olved to hang the Duke at Tyburn; and for
that purpo&s;e bound him, and mounted him on hor&s;e|back
behind one of his companions. They were ad|vanced
a good way into the fields; when the Duke,
making efforts for his liberty, threw him&s;elf to the
ground, and brought down with him the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to
whom he was tied. They were &s;truggling together in
the mud; when Ormond's &s;ervants, whom the alarm
had reached, came and &s;aved him. Blood and his com|panions,
firing their pi&s;tols in a hurry at the Duke,
rode off and &s;aved them&s;elves by means of the darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUCKINGHAM was at fir&s;t, with &s;ome appearance of
rea&s;on, &s;u&s;pected to be the author of the attempt. His
profligate character, and his enmity again&s;t Ormond,
expo&s;ed him to this imputation. O&s;&s;ory &s;oon after came
to court, and &s;eeing Buckingham &s;tand by the King,
his colour ro&s;e, and he could not forbear expre&s;&s;ing
him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e. &startq;My Lord, I know well,
that you are at the bottom of this late attempt upon
<PB N="481" REF="575">
my father: but I give you warning, if by any means
he comes to a violent end, I &s;hall not be at a lo&s;s to
know the author: I &s;hall con&s;ider you as the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in:
I &s;hall treat you as &s;uch; and wherever I meet you,
I &s;hall pi&s;tol you, though you &s;tood behind the King's
chair; and I tell it you in his Maje&s;ty's pre&s;ence,
that you may be &s;ure I &s;hall not fail of perform|ance<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Carte's Ormond, vol. ii. p. 225.</NOTE>.&endq; If there was here any indecorum, it was
ea&s;ily excu&s;ed in a generous youth, when his father's
life was expo&s;ed to danger.</P>
<P>A LITTLE after, Blood formed a de&s;ign of carrying
off the crown and regalia from the tower; a de&s;ign, to
which he was prompted, as well by the &s;urpri&s;ing bold|ne&s;s
of the enterprize, as by the views of profit. He
was very near &s;ucceeding. He had bound and wounded
Edwards, the keeper of the jewel-office, and had got
out of the Tower with his prey, but was overtaken and
&s;eized, with &s;ome of his a&s;&s;ociates. One of them was
known to have been concerned in the attempt upon
Ormond; and Blood was immediately concluded to be
the ringleader. When a&s;ked, he frankly avowed the
enterprize; but refu&s;ed to tell his accomplices. &startq;The
fear of death,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;would never engage him,
either to deny a guilt, or betray a friend.&endq; All the&s;e
extraordinary circum&s;tances made him the general &s;ub|ject
of conver&s;ation; and the King was moved by an
idle curio&s;ity to &s;ee and &s;peak with a per&s;on &s;o noted for
his courage and his crimes. Blood might now e&s;teem
him&s;elf &s;ecure of pardon, and he wanted not addre&s;s to
improve the opportunity. He told Charles, that he had
been engaged, with others, in a de&s;ign to kill him with
a carabine above Batter&s;ea, where his Maje&s;ty often
went to bathe: That the cau&s;e of this re&s;olution was
the &s;everity exerci&s;ed over the con&s;ciences of the godly,
<PB N="482" REF="576">
in re&s;training the liberty of their religious a&s;&s;emblies:
That when he had taken his &s;tand among the reeds,
full of the&s;e bloody re&s;olutions, he found his heart
checked with an awe of Maje&s;ty; and not only relented
him&s;elf, but diverted his a&s;&s;ociates from their purpo&s;e:
That he had long ago brought him&s;elf to an entire in|difference
about life, which he now gave for lo&s;t; yet
could he not forbear warning the King of the danger
which might attend his execution: That his a&s;&s;ociates
had bound them&s;elves together by the &s;tricte&s;t oaths to
revenge the death of any of their confederacy: And
that no precaution nor power could &s;ecure any one
from the effects of their de&s;perate re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>WHETHER the&s;e con&s;iderations excited fear or ad|miration
in the King, they confirmed his re&s;olution of
granting a pardon to Blood; but he thought it a re|qui&s;ite
point of decency fir&s;t to obtain the Duke of Or|mond's
con&s;ent. Arlington came to Ormond in the
King's name, and de&s;ired that he would not pro&s;ecute
Blood, for rea&s;ons which he was commanded to give
him. The Duke gallantly replied, that his Maje&s;ty's
commands were the only rea&s;on, that could be given,
and being &s;ufficient, he might therefore &s;pare the re&s;t.
Charles carried his kindne&s;s to Blood &s;till farther: He
granted him an e&s;tate of five hundred pounds a year in
Ireland; he encouraged his attendance about his per|&s;on;
he &s;howed him great countenance, and many
applied to him for promoting their preten&s;ions at court.
And while old Edwards, who had bravely ventured his
life, and had been wounded, in defending the crown
and regalia, was forgotten and neglected, this man,
who de&s;erved only to be &s;tared at, and dete&s;ted as a
mon&s;ter, became a kind of favourite.</P>
<P>ERRORS of this nature in private life, have often as
bad an influence as mi&s;carriages, in which the public is
<PB N="483" REF="577">
more immediately concerned. Another incident hap|pened
this year, which infu&s;ed a very general di&s;plea|&s;ure,
and &s;till greater apprehen&s;ions, into all men. The
Dutche&s;s of York died, and in her la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, &s;he
made open profe&s;&s;ion of the Romi&s;h religion, and
fini&s;hed her life in that communion. This put an end
to that thin di&s;gui&s;e, which the Duke had hitherto
worne;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke de|clares him|&s;elf catholic.</NOTE> and he now openly declared his attachment to
the church of Rome. Unaccountable terrors of popery,
ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Stuart, had pre|vailed
throughout the nation; but the&s;e had formerly
been found &s;o groundle&s;s, and had been employed to &s;o
many bad purpo&s;es, that &s;urmi&s;es of this nature were
likely to meet with the le&s;s credit from all men of
&s;en&s;e; and nothing but the Duke's imprudent bigotry
could have convinced the whole nation of his conver&s;ion.
Popery, which had hitherto been only a hideous &s;pectre,
was now become a real ground of terror, being openly
and zealou&s;ly embraced by the heir apparent to the
crown, a Prince of indu&s;try and enterprize; while the
King him&s;elf was not entirely free from like &s;u&s;pi|cions.</P>
<P>IT is probable, that the new alliance of France in|&s;pired
the Duke with courage to make open profe&s;&s;ion
of his religion, and rendered him more carele&s;s of the
affections and e&s;teem of the Engli&s;h. This alliance be|came
every day more vi&s;ible to all the world. Temple
was declared to be no longer Amba&s;&s;ador to the States;
and Downing, whom the Dutch regarded as the invete|rate
enemy of their republic, was &s;ent over in his place.
A ground of quarrel was &s;ought by means of a yacht,
di&s;patched for Lady Temple. The Captain &s;ailed thro'
the Dutch fleet, which lay on their own coa&s;ts; and he
had orders to make them &s;trike, to fire on them, and to
per&s;evere till they &s;hould return his fire. The Dutch
Admiral, Van Ghent, &s;urpri&s;ed at this bravado, came
<PB N="484" REF="578">
on board the yacht, and expre&s;&s;ed his willingne&s;s to
pay re&s;pect to the Briti&s;h flag, according to antient
practice: But that a fleet on their own coa&s;ts &s;hould
&s;trike to a &s;ingle ve&s;&s;el, and that not a &s;hip of war,
was, he &s;aid, &s;uch an innovation, that he dur&s;t not,
without expre&s;s orders, agree to it. The Captain,
thinking it dangerous to renew firing in the mid&s;t of the
Dutch fleet, continued his voyage; and for this neglect
of orders was committed to the Tower.</P>
<P>THIS incident however furni&s;hed Downing with a
new article to increa&s;e tho&s;e vain pretences, on which
it was propo&s;ed to ground the intended quarrel. The
Engli&s;h court delayed &s;everal months before they com|plained;
le&s;t, if they had demanded &s;atisfaction more
early, the Dutch might have had time to grant it. Even
when Downing delivered his memorial, he was bound
by his in&s;tructions not to accept of any &s;atisfaction after
a certain number of days; a very imperious manner of
negotiating, and impracticable in Holland, where the
forms of the republic render delays ab&s;olutely unavoid|able.
An an&s;wer, however, though refu&s;ed by Down|ing,
was &s;ent over to London; with an Amba&s;&s;ador
Extraordinary, who had orders to u&s;e every expedient
which might give &s;atisfaction to the court of England.
That court replied, that the an&s;wer of the Hollanders was
dark and ob&s;cure; but they would not &s;pecify the ar|ticles
or expre&s;&s;ions, which were liable to that objection.
The Dutch Amba&s;&s;ador de&s;ired the Engli&s;h mini&s;try to
draw the an&s;wer in what terms they plea&s;ed; and he
engaged to &s;ign it: The Engli&s;h mini&s;try replied, that
it was not their bu&s;ine&s;s to draw papers for the
Dutch. The Amba&s;&s;ador brought them the draught of
an article, and a&s;ked them whether it was &s;atisfactory:
The Engli&s;h an&s;wered, that, when he had &s;igned and
delivered it, they would tell him their mind concerning
it. The Dutchman re&s;olved to &s;ign it at a venture;
<PB N="485" REF="579">
and on his demanding a new conference,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1672.</NOTE> an hour was
appointed for that purpo&s;e. But when he attended, the
Engli&s;h refu&s;ed to enter upon bu&s;ine&s;s, and told him,
that the &s;ea&s;on for negotiating was now pa&s;t<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">England's Appeal, p. 22.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>LONG and frequent prorogations were made of the
parliament; le&s;t the Hou&s;es &s;hould declare them&s;elves
with vigour again&s;t councils, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the inclina|tion
as well as intere&s;ts of the public. Could we &s;up|po&s;e,
that Charles, in his alliance again&s;t Holland,
really meant the good of his people, that mea&s;ure mu&s;t
pa&s;s for an extraordinary, nay, a romantic, &s;train of
heroi&s;m, which could lead him, in &s;pite of all difficul|ties,
and even in &s;pite of them&s;elves, to &s;eek the happi|ne&s;s
of the nation. But every &s;tep, which he took in
this affair, became a proof to all men of penetration,
that the pre&s;ent war was intended again&s;t the liberties of
his own &s;ubjects, even more than again&s;t the Dutch
them&s;elves. He now acted in every thing, as if he
were already an ab&s;olute monarch, and was never more
to lie under the controul of national a&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>THE long prorogation of parliament, if it freed the
King from their importunate advices and remon&s;trances,
was however attended with this inconvenience, that no
money could be procured to carry on the military pre|parations
again&s;t Holland. Under pretence of main|taining
the triple league, which, at that very time, he
had firmly re&s;olved to break, Charles had obtained a
large &s;upply from the Commons; but this money was
&s;oon exhau&s;ted by debts and expences. France had &s;ti|pulated
to pay two hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds
the fir&s;t year of the war, and the third of that &s;um
every year during the cour&s;e of it; but the&s;e &s;upplies
were very incon&s;iderable, compared to the immen&s;e
charge of the Engli&s;h navy. It &s;eemed as yet premature
to venture on levying money, without con&s;ent of par|liament;
<PB N="486" REF="580">
&s;ince the power of taxing them&s;elves was the
privilege, of which the Engli&s;h were, with rea&s;on, par|ticularly
jealous. Some other re&s;ource mu&s;t be fallen
on. The King had declared, that the &s;taff of trea&s;urer
was ready for any one, that could find an expedient
for &s;upplying the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities. Shaft&s;bury drop|ped
a hint to Clifford, which the latter immediately
&s;eized, and carried to the King, who granted him the
promi&s;ed reward, together with a peerage. This expe|dient
was the &s;hutting up the Exchequer, and retaining
all the payments, which &s;hould be made into it.</P>
<P>IT had been u&s;ual for the bankers to carry their
money to the Exchequer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of Janu|ary. Exche|quer &s;hut.</NOTE> and to advance it upon the
&s;ecurity of the funds, by which they were afterwards
repaid, when the money was levied on the public.
The bankers, by this traffic, got eight, &s;ometimes ten,
per cent. for &s;ums, which either had been con&s;igned
to them without intere&s;t, or which they had borrowed
at &s;ix per cent: Profits, which they dearly paid for by
this egregious breach of public faith. The mea&s;ure
was &s;o &s;uddenly taken, that none had warning of the
danger. A general confu&s;ion prevailed in the city, fol|lowed
by the ruin of many. The bankers &s;topped pay|ment;
the merchants could an&s;wer no bills; di&s;tru&s;t
took place every where, with a &s;tagnation of com|merce,
by which the public was univer&s;ally affected.
And men, full of di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions, a&s;ked each other
what mu&s;t be the &s;cope of tho&s;e my&s;terious councils,
whence the parliament and all men of honour were ex|cluded,
and which commenced by the forfeiture of pub|lic
credit, and an open violation of the mo&s;t &s;olemn en|gagements,
both foreign and dome&s;tic.</P>
<P>ANOTHER mea&s;ure of the court contains &s;omething
laudable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indul|gence.</NOTE> when con&s;idered in it&s;elf; but if we reflect on
the motive whence it proceeded, as well as the time
<PB N="487" REF="581">
when it was embraced, it will appear a &s;trong in&s;tance
of the arbitrary and dangerous councils, pur&s;ued at pre|&s;ent
by the King and his mini&s;try. Charles re&s;olved to
make u&s;e of his &s;upreme power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters;
a power, he &s;aid, which was not only inherent in him,
but which had been recognized by &s;everal acts of par|liament.
By virtue of this authority, he i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of March.</NOTE>
&s;u&s;pending the penal laws, enacted again&s;t
all nonconformi&s;ts or recu&s;ants what&s;oever, and grant|ing
to the prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters the public exerci&s;e of
their religion, to the catholics the exerci&s;e of it in pri|vate
hou&s;es. A fruitle&s;s experiment of this kind, op|po&s;ed
by the parliament, and retracted by the King,
had already been made a few years after the re&s;toration;
but Charles expected that the parliament, whenever it
&s;hould meet, would now be tamed to greater &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,
and would no longer dare to controul his mea&s;ures.
Meanwhile, the di&s;&s;enters, the mo&s;t inveterate enemies
to the court, were mollified by the&s;e indulgent maxims:
And the catholics, under their &s;helter, enjoyed more li|berty
than the laws had hitherto allowed them.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, the act of navigation was &s;u&s;pend|ed
by royal will and plea&s;ure: A mea&s;ure, which, tho'
a &s;tretch of prerogative, &s;eemed u&s;eful to commerce,
while all the &s;eamen were employed on board the royal
navy. A like &s;u&s;pen&s;ion had been granted, during the
time of the fir&s;t Dutch war, and was not much re|marked;
becau&s;e men had, at that time, entertained
le&s;s jealou&s;y of the crown. A proclamation was al&s;o
i&s;&s;ued, containing very rigorous clau&s;es in favour of
pre&s;&s;ing: Another full of menaces again&s;t tho&s;e who
pre&s;umed to &s;peak undutifully of his Maje&s;ty's mea&s;ures,
and even again&s;t tho&s;e who heard &s;uch di&s;cour&s;es, un|le&s;s
they informed in due time upon the offenders: An|other
again&s;t importing or vending any &s;orts of painted
<PB N="488" REF="582">
earthen ware, &startq;except tho&s;e of China, upon pain of
being grievou&s;ly fined, and &s;uffering the utmo&s;t pu|ni&s;hment,
which might be lawfully inflicted upon con|temners
of his Maje&s;ty's royal authority.&endq; A new
army had been levied; and it was found, that di&s;cipline
could not be enforced without the exerci&s;e of martial
law, which was therefore e&s;tabli&s;hed by order of coun|cil,
though contrary to the petition of right. All the&s;e
acts of power, however little important in them&s;elves,
favoured &s;trongly of arbitrary government, and were
no-wi&s;e &s;uitable to that legal admini&s;tration, which the
parliament, after &s;uch violent convul&s;ions and civil
wars, had hoped to have e&s;tabli&s;hed in the kingdom.</P>
<P>IT may be worth remarking, that the Lord-Keeper
refu&s;ed to affix the &s;eals to the declaration for &s;u&s;pend|ing
the penal laws; and was for that rea&s;on, though
under other pretences, removed from his office. Sha&s;te&s;|bury
was made Chancellor in his place; and thus an|other
member of the Cabal received the reward of his
councils.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attack of the Smyrna fleet.</NOTE> FOREIGN tran&s;actions kept pace with the&s;e dome&s;tic
occurrences. An attempt, before the declaration of
war, was made on the Dutch Smyrna fleet by Sir Ro|bert
Holmes. That fleet con&s;i&s;ted of &s;eventy &s;ail, va|lued
at a million and a half; and the hopes of &s;eizing
&s;o rich a prey had been a great motive for engaging
Charles in the pre&s;ent war, and he had con&s;idered that
capture as a principal re&s;ource for &s;upporting his mili|tary
enterprizes. Holmes, with nine frigates and three
yachts, had orders to go in &s;earch of this fleet; and he
pa&s;&s;ed Sprague in the channel, who was returning home
with a &s;quadron from a cruize in the Mediterranean.
Sprague informed him of the near approach of the Hol|landers;
and had not Holmes, from a de&s;ire of engro&s;|&s;ing
all the honour and profit of the enterprize, kept
<PB N="489" REF="583">
the &s;ecret of his orders, the conjunction of the&s;e &s;qua|drons
had rendered the &s;ucce&s;s infallible. When Holmes
approached the Dutch, he put on an amicable appear|ance,
and invited the admiral, Van Ne&s;s, who com|manded
the convoy,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of March.</NOTE> to come on board of him: One of
his captains gave a like in&s;idious invitation to the rear-admiral.
But the&s;e officers were on their guard. They
had received an intimation of the ho&s;tile intentions of
the Engli&s;h, and had already put all the &s;hips of war
and merchantmen in an excellent po&s;ture of defence.
Three times were they valiantly a&s;&s;ailed by the Engli&s;h;
and as often did they valiantly defend them&s;elves. In
the third attack one of the Dutch &s;hips of war was
taken; and three or four of their mo&s;t incon&s;iderable
merchantmen fell into the enemies hands. The re&s;t,
fighting with great &s;kill and courage, continued their
cour&s;e; and, favoured by a mi&s;t, got &s;afe into their own
harbours. This attempt is denominated perfidious and
pyratical by the Dutch writers, and even by many of
the Engli&s;h. It merits at lea&s;t the appellation of irre|gular;
and as it had been attended with bad &s;ucce&s;s, it
brought double &s;hame upon the contrivers. The Eng|li&s;h
mini&s;try endeavoured to cover the action, by pre|tending
that it was a ca&s;ual rencounter, ari&s;ing from the
ob&s;tinacy of the Dutch, who refu&s;ed the honours of the
flag: But the contrary was &s;o well known, that even
Holmes him&s;elf had not the a&s;&s;urance to per&s;i&s;t in this
a&s;&s;everation.</P>
<P>'TILL this incident the States, notwith&s;tanding all
the menaces and preparations of the Engli&s;h, never be|lieved
them to be thoroughly in earne&s;t; and had al|ways
expected, that the affair would terminate either in
&s;ome demands of money, or in &s;ome propo&s;als for the
advancement of the Prince of Orange. The French
them&s;elves had made little account of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from
<PB N="490" REF="584">
England; and could &s;carce believe, that their ambitious
projects would, contrary to every maxim of honour and
policy, be forwarded by that power, which was mo&s;t
intere&s;ted, and mo&s;t able to oppo&s;e them. But Charles
was too far advanced to retreat.<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of March. War declared with Hol|land.</NOTE> He immediately i&s;&s;ued
a declaration of war again&s;t the Dutch; and &s;urely rea|&s;ons
more fal&s;e and frivolous never were employed to
ju&s;tify a flagrant violation of treaty. Some complaints
are made of injuries done to the Ea&s;t India Company,
which yet that company di&s;avowed: The detention of
&s;ome Engli&s;h in Surinam is mentioned; though it ap|pears,
that the&s;e per&s;ons had voluntarily remained there:
The refu&s;al of a Dutch fleet on their own coa&s;ts to
&s;trike to an Engli&s;h yacht, is much aggravated: And to
piece up all the&s;e preten&s;ions, &s;ome abu&s;ive pictures are
mentioned, and repre&s;ented as a ground of quarrel.
The Dutch were long at a lo&s;s what to make of this
article; till at la&s;t it was di&s;covered, that a portrait of
Cornelius de Wit, brother to the pen&s;ionary, painted
by order of &s;ome magi&s;trates of Dort, and hung up in a
chamber of the town-hou&s;e, had given occa&s;ion to the
complaint. In the per&s;pective of this portrait, the
painter had drawn &s;ome &s;hips on fire in a harbour. This
was con&s;trued to be Chatham, where de Wit had really
di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, and had acquired great honour;
but little did he imagine, that, while the in&s;ult it&s;elf
had &s;o long been forgiven, the picture of it &s;hould draw
&s;uch &s;evere vengeance upon his country. The conclu|&s;ion
of this manife&s;to, where the King &s;till profe&s;&s;ed his
attachment to the triple alliance, was of a piece with all
the re&s;t of it.</P>
<P>THE French King's declaration of war contained
more dignity, if undi&s;gui&s;ed violence and inju&s;tice could
merit that appellation. He pretended only, that the
behaviour of the Hollanders had been &s;uch, that it did
not con&s;i&s;t with his glory any longer to bear it. That
<PB N="491" REF="585">
monarch's preparations were in great forwardne&s;s; and
his ambition was flattered with the mo&s;t promi&s;ing views
of &s;ucce&s;s. Sweden was detached from the triple league:
The bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter was engaged by the payment of
&s;ub&s;idies to take part with France: The elector of Co|logne
had entered into the &s;ame alliance; and having
con&s;igned Bonne and other towns into the hands of
Lewis, magazines were there erected; and it was from
that quarter that France propo&s;ed to invade the United
Provinces. The &s;tanding force of that kingdom amount|ed
to one hundred and eighty thou&s;and men; and with
more than the half of this great army was the King
now approaching to the Dutch frontiers. The order,
oeconomy, indu&s;try of Colbert, &s;ub&s;ervient equally to
the ambition of the Prince and happine&s;s of the
people, furni&s;hed unexhau&s;ted trea&s;ures: The&s;e, em|ployed
by the unrelenting vigilance of Louvois, &s;up|plied
every military preparation, and facilitated all the
enterprizes of the army: Cond&eacute;, Turenne, &s;econded
by Luxembourg, Crequi, and the mo&s;t renowned ge|nerals
of the age, conducted this army, and by their
conduct and reputation in&s;pired courage into every one.
The monarch him&s;elf, &s;urrounded with a gallant nobi|lity,
animated his troops by the pro&s;pect of reward, or,
what was more valued, by the hopes of his approba|tion.
The fatigues of war gave no interruption to
gaiety: Its dangers furni&s;hed matter for glory; and in
no enterprize did the genius of that gallant and polite
people ever break out with more di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THOUGH de Wit's intelligence in foreign courts was
not equal to the vigilance of his dome&s;tic admini&s;tration,
he had, long before, received many &s;urmi&s;es of this fatal
confederacy; but he prepared not for defence, &s;o early
or with &s;uch indu&s;try, as the danger required. An union
of England with France was evidently, he &s;aw, de&s;truc|tive
to the intere&s;ts of the former kingdom; and there|fore,
<PB N="492" REF="586">
overlooking or ignorant of the humours and &s;ecret
views of Charles, he concluded it impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch
pernicious projects could ever really be carried into exe|cution.
Secure in this fallacious rea&s;oning, he allowed
the republic to remain too long in that defencele&s;s &s;itu|ation,
into which many concurring accidents had united
to throw it.</P>
<P>BY a continued and &s;ucce&s;sful application to com|merce,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Weakne&s;s of the States.</NOTE>
the people were become very unwarlike, and
confided entirely for their defence in that mercenary
army, which they maintained. After the treaty of
We&s;tphalia, the States, tru&s;ting to their peace with
Spain, and their alliance with France, had broke a
great part of this army, and did not &s;upport with &s;uffi|cient
vigilance the di&s;cipline of the troops which re|mained.
When the ari&s;tocratic party prevailed, it was
thought prudent to di&s;mi&s;s many of the old experienced
officers, who were devoted to the hou&s;e of Orange;
and their place was &s;upplied by raw youths, the &s;ons or
kin&s;men of burgoma&s;ters, by who&s;e intere&s;t the party
was &s;upported. The&s;e new officers, relying on the
credit of their friends and family, neglected their mili|tary
duty; and &s;ome of them, it is &s;aid, were even al|lowed
to &s;erve by deputies, to whom they a&s;&s;igned a
&s;mall part of their pay. During the war with England,
all the forces of that nation had been di&s;banded: Lewis's
inva&s;ion of Flanders, followed by the triple league, oc|ca&s;ioned
the di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the French regiments: And
the place of the&s;e troops, which had ever had a chief
&s;hare in the honour and fortune of all the wars in the
low countries, had not been &s;upplied by any new levies.</P>
<P>DE WIT, &s;en&s;ible of this dangerous &s;ituation, and
alarmed by the reports which came from all quarters,
be&s;tirred him&s;elf to &s;upply tho&s;e defects, to which it was
not ea&s;y of a &s;udden to provide a &s;uitable remedy. But
<PB N="493" REF="587">
every propo&s;al which he could make, met with oppo&s;i|tion
from the Orange party, which was now become
extremely formidable. The long and uncontrouled ad|mini&s;tration
of this &s;tate&s;man had begot envy: the pre|&s;ent
incidents rou&s;ed up his enemies and opponents,
who a&s;cribed to his mi&s;conduct alone the bad &s;ituation
of the commonwealth: And, above all, the popular af|fection
to the young Prince, which had &s;o long been
held in violent con&s;traint, and had thence acquired new
acce&s;&s;ion of force, began to di&s;play it&s;elf, and to threaten
the commonwealth with &s;ome great convul&s;ion. Wil|liam
the third, Prince of Orange, was now in the
twenty-&s;econd year of his age, and gave &s;trong indica|tions
of all tho&s;e great qualities, by which his life was
afterwards &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed. De Wit him&s;elf, by
giving him an excellent education, and in&s;tructing him
in all the principles of government and &s;ound policy,
had generou&s;ly contributed to make his rival formidable.
Dreading the precarious &s;ituation of his own party, he
was always re&s;olved, he &s;aid, by conveying to him the
knowledge of affairs, to render the Prince capable of
&s;erving his country, if ever any future emergence &s;hould
throw the admini&s;tration into his hands. The conduct
of the young Prince had hitherto been extremely lauda|ble.
Notwith&s;tanding his powerful alliances with Eng|land
and Brandenburgh, he had expre&s;&s;ed his re&s;olution
of depending entirely on the States for his advancement;
and the whole tenor of his behaviour &s;uited extremely
the genius of that people. Silent and thoughtful; given
to hear and to enquire; of a &s;ound and &s;teady under|&s;tanding:
much firmne&s;s in what he once re&s;olved, or
once denied; great application to bu&s;ine&s;s, little to
plea&s;ure: By the&s;e virtues he engaged the attention of
all men. And the people, &s;en&s;ible that they owed their
liberty, and very exi&s;tence, to his family, and remem|bring,
that his great uncle, Maurice, had been able,
<PB N="494" REF="588">
even in more early youth, to protect them again&s;t the
exorbitant power of Spain, were de&s;irous of rai&s;ing this
Prince to all the authority of his ance&s;tors, and hoped,
from his valour and conduct alone, to receive protection
again&s;t tho&s;e imminent dangers, with which they were
at pre&s;ent threatened.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e two powerful factions &s;truggled for &s;u|periority,
every &s;cheme for defence was oppo&s;ed, every
project retarded. What was determined with difficulty,
was executed without vigour. Levies indeed were
made, and the army compleated to &s;eventy thou&s;and
men<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 75.</NOTE>: The Prince was appointed both general and ad|miral
of the Commonwealth, and the whole military
power was put into his hands. But new troops could
not of a &s;udden acquire di&s;cipline and experience: And
the partizans of the Prince were &s;till un&s;atisfied, as long
as the <HI>perpetual edict,</HI> &s;o it was called, remained in force;
by which he was excluded from the Stadtholder&s;hip,
and from all &s;hare in the civil admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>It had always been the maxim of de Wit's party to
cultivate naval affairs with extreme care, and to give
the flect a vi&s;ible preference above the army, which they
repre&s;ented as the object of an unrea&s;onable partiality in
the Princes of Orange. The two violent wars, which
had of late been waged with England, had exerci&s;ed the
valour, and improved the &s;kill of the &s;ailors. And,
above all, de Ruyter, the greate&s;t &s;ea commander of the
age, was clo&s;ely connected with the Love&s;tein party;
and every one was di&s;po&s;ed, with confidence and ala|crity,
to obey him. The equipment of the fleet was
therefore ha&s;tened by de Wit; in hopes, that, by &s;trik|ing
at fir&s;t a &s;ucce&s;sful blow, he might in&s;pire courage
into the di&s;mayed States, and &s;upport his own declining
authority. He &s;eems too, to have been, in a peculiar
<PB N="495" REF="589">
manner, enraged again&s;t the Engli&s;h; and he re&s;olved
to take revenge on them for their conduct, of which, he
thought, his country had &s;uch rea&s;on to complain. By
the offer of a clo&s;e alliance and confederacy for mutual
defence, they had &s;educed the Republic to quit the al|liance
of France; but no &s;ooner had &s;he embraced the&s;e
mea&s;ures, than they formed leagues for her de&s;truction,
with that very power, which they had treacherou&s;ly en|gaged her to offend. In the mid&s;t of full peace, nay,
during an intimate union, they had attacked her com|merce,
the only means of her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and, moved
by &s;hameful rapacity, had invaded that property, which,
relying on their faith, they had hoped to find unpro|tected
and defencele&s;s. Contrary to their own vi&s;ible
intere&s;t, as well as to their honour, they &s;till retained a
malignant re&s;entment for her &s;ucce&s;sful conclu&s;ion of
the la&s;t war; a war, which had, at fir&s;t, &s;prung from
their own wanton in&s;olence and ambition. To repre&s;s
&s;o dangerous an enemy, would, de Wit imagined, give
a peculiar plea&s;ure, and contribute to the future &s;ecu|rity
of his country, who&s;e pro&s;perity was &s;o much the
object of general envy.</P>
<P>Actuated by like motives and views, de Ruyter put to
&s;ea with a formidable fleet, con&s;i&s;ting of ninety-one &s;hips
of war and forty-four fire-&s;hips. Cornelius de Wit was
on board, as deputy from the States. They &s;ailed in
que&s;t of the Engli&s;h, who were under the command of
the Duke of York, and who had already joined the
French under Mare&s;chal d' Etr&eacute;cs. The combined fleets
lay at Solebay in a very negligent po&s;ture; and Sand|wich,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Solebay. 28th of May.</NOTE>
being an experienced officer, had given the Duke
warning of the danger; but received, 'tis &s;aid, &s;uch an
an&s;wer as intimated, that there was more of caution than
of courage in his apprehen&s;ions. Upon the appearance
of the enemy, every one ran to his po&s;t with precipita|tion,
and many &s;hips were obliged to cut their cables,
<PB N="496" REF="590">
in order to be in readine&s;s. Sandwich commanded the
van; and though determined to conquer or to peri&s;h, he
&s;o tempered his courage with prudence, that the whole
fleet was vi&s;ibly indebted to him for its &s;afety. He
ha&s;tened out of the bay, where it had been ea&s;y for de
Ruyter with his fire-&s;hips to have de&s;troyed the combi|ned
fleets, which were crowded together; and by this
wi&s;e mea&s;ure he gave time to the Duke of York, who
commanded the main body, and to Mare&s;chal d' Etr&eacute;es,
Admiral of the rear, to di&s;engage them&s;elves. He
him&s;elf meanwhile was engaged in clo&s;e fight with the
Hollanders; and by pre&s;enting him&s;elf to every danger,
had drawn upon him all the brave&s;t of the enemy. He
killed Van Ghent, the Dutch Admiral, and beat off his
&s;hip: He &s;unk another &s;hip, which ventured to lay him
aboard: He &s;unk three fire-&s;hips, which endeavoured to
grapple with him: And though his ve&s;&s;el was torne in
pieces with &s;hot, and of a thou&s;and men &s;he contained,
near &s;ix hundred were laid dead upon the deck, he con|tinued
&s;till to thunder with all his artillery in the mid&s;t
of the enemy. But another fire-&s;hip, more fortunate
than the preceding, having laid hold of his ve&s;&s;el, her
de&s;truction was now inevitable. Warned by Sir Ed|ward
Haddock, his Captain, he refu&s;ed to make his
e&s;cape,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sandwich killed</NOTE> and bravely embraced death as a &s;helter from that
ignominy, which a ra&s;h expre&s;&s;ion of the Duke, he
thought, had thrown upon him.</P>
<P>DURING this fierce engagement with Sandwich, de
Ruyter remained not inactive. He attacked the Duke
of York, and &s;ought him with &s;uch fury for above two
hours, that of two and thirty actions, in which he had
been engaged, he declared this combat to be the mo&s;t
ob&s;tinately di&s;puted. The Duke's &s;hip was &s;o &s;hattered,
that he was obliged to leave her, and remove his flag to
another. His &s;quadron was overpowered with num|bers;
till Sir Jo&s;eph Jordan, who had &s;ucceeded to
<PB N="497" REF="591">
Sandwich's command, came to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the
&s;ight, being more equally ballanced, was continued till
night, when the Dutch retired, and were not followed
by the Engli&s;h. The lo&s;s &s;u&s;tained by the fleets of the
two maritime powers was nearly equal, if it did not ra|ther
&s;all more heavy on the Engli&s;h. The French &s;uf|fered
very little, becau&s;e they had &s;carce been engaged
in the action; and as this backwardne&s;s is not their na|tional
character, it was concluded, that they had re|ceived
orders to &s;pare their &s;hips, while the Dutch and
Engli&s;h &s;hould weaken them&s;elves by their mutual ani|mo&s;ity.
Almo&s;t all the other actions during the pre|&s;ent
war tended to confirm this &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>IT brought great honour to the Dutch to have fought
with &s;ome advantage the combined fleets of two &s;uch
powerful nations; but nothing le&s;s than a compleat vic|tory
could &s;erve the purpo&s;e of de Wit, or &s;ave his coun|try
from tho&s;e calamities which from every quarter
threatened to overwhelm her. He had expected, that
the French would make their attack on the &s;ide of Ma|e&s;tricht,
which was well fortified, and provided of a
good garri&s;on; but Lewis, taking advantage of his al|liance
with Cologne, re&s;olved to invade the enemy from
that quarter, which he knew to be more feeble and de|fencele&s;s.
The armies of that Elector, and tho&s;e of
Mun&s;ter appeared on the other &s;ide of the Rhine, and
divided the force and attention of the States. The
Dutch troops, too weak to defend &s;o exten&s;ive a fron|tier,
were &s;cattered into &s;o many towns, that no con|&s;iderable
body remained in the field; and a &s;trong gar|ri&s;on
was hardly to be found in any fortre&s;s. Lewis
pa&s;&s;ed the Meu&s;e at Vi&s;et; and laying &s;iege to Or&s;oi,<NOTE PLACE="marg">14th of May.</NOTE> a
town of the Elector of Brandenburgh, but garri&s;oned by
the Dutch,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Progre&s;s of the French.</NOTE> he carried it in three days. He divided
his army, and inve&s;ted at once Burik, We&s;el, Emerik,
and Rhimberg, four places regularly fortified, and not
<PB N="498" REF="592">
unprovided of troops: In a few days all the&s;e places
were &s;urrendered. A general a&s;toni&s;hment had &s;eized
the Hollanders, from the combination of &s;uch powerful
Princes again&s;t the Republic; and no where was re|&s;i&s;tance
made, &s;uitable to the antient glory or pre&s;ent
greatne&s;s of the State. Governors without experience
commanded troops without di&s;cipline; and de&s;pair had
univer&s;ally extingui&s;hed that &s;en&s;e of honour, by which
alone, men in &s;uch dangerous extremities can be ani|mated
to a valorous defence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of June.</NOTE> LEWIS advanced of the banks of the Rhine, which
he prepared to pa&s;s. To all the other calamities of the
Dutch was added the extreme drought of the &s;ea&s;on, by
which the greate&s;t rivers were much dimini&s;hed, and in
&s;ome places rendered fordable. The French cavalry,
animated by the pre&s;ence of their Prince, full of impe|tuous
courage, but ranged in exact order, flung them|&s;elves
into the river: The infantry pa&s;&s;ed in boats: a
few regiments of Dutch appeared on the other &s;ide,
who were unable to make re&s;i&s;tance. And thus was
executed without danger, but not without glory, the
pa&s;&s;age of the Rhine: &s;o much celebrated, at that time,
by the flattery of French courtiers, and tran&s;mitted to
po&s;terity by the more durable flattery of their poets.</P>
<P>EACH &s;ucce&s;s added courage to the conquerors, and
&s;truck the vanqui&s;hed with di&s;may. The Prince of
Orange, though prudent beyond his age, was but newly
advanced to the command, unacquainted with the army,
unknown to them; and all men, by rea&s;on of the vio|lent
factions which prevailed, were uncertain of the au|thority
on which they mu&s;t depend. It was expected
that the fort of Skink, &s;o famous for the &s;ieges which $word$
had formerly &s;u&s;tained, would make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance $word$
but it yielded to Turenne in a few days. The &s;ame
General made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Arnheim, Knotzem|bourg,
<PB N="499" REF="593">
and Nimeguen, as &s;oon as he appeared before
them. Doe&s;bourg at the &s;ame time opened its gates to
Lewis: Soon after, Harderwic, Amers&s;ort, Campen,
Rhenen, Viane, Elberg, Zwol, Cuilemberg, Wage|ninguen,
Lochem, Woerden, &s;ell into the enemies hands.
Groll and Deventer &s;urrendered to the Mare&s;chal Lux|embourg,
who commanded the troops of Mun&s;ter. And
every hour brought to the States news of the rapid pro|gre&s;s
of the French, and of the cowardly defence of
their own garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange, with his &s;mall and di&s;cou|raged
army, retired into the province of Holland;
where he expected, from the natural &s;trength of the
country, &s;ince all human art and courage failed, to be
able to make &s;ome re&s;i&s;tance. The town and province
of Utrecht &s;ent deputations, and &s;urrendered them&s;elves
to Lewis. Naerden, a place within three leagues of
Am&s;terdam, was &s;eized by the Marquis of Rochfort;
and had he pu&s;hed on to Muyden, he had ea&s;ily got
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. Fourteen &s;tragglers of his army having
appeared before the gates of that town, the magi&s;trates
&s;ent them the keys; but a &s;ervant maid, whoi was alone
in the ca&s;tle, having rai&s;ed the drawbridge, kept them
from taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fortre&s;s. The magi&s;trates
afterwards, finding the party &s;o weak, made them drunk,
and took the keys from them. Muyden is &s;o near Am|&s;terdam,
that its cannon may infe&s;t the &s;hips which en|ter
that city.</P>
<P>LEWIS with a &s;plendid court made a &s;olemn entry<NOTE PLACE="marg">2$th of June.</NOTE>
into Utrecht, full of glory, becau&s;e every where attend|ed
with &s;ucce&s;s; though more owing to the cowardice
and mi&s;conduct of his enemies, than to his own valour
or prudence. Three provinces were already in his
hands, Guelderland, Overy&s;iel, and Utrecht; Groning|hen
was threatened; Friezeland lay expo&s;ed: The
<PB N="500" REF="594">
only difficulty lay in Holland and Zealand; and the
monarch deliberated concerning the proper mea&s;ures for
reducing them. Cond&eacute; and Turenne exhorted him to
di&s;mantle all the towns, which he had taken, except a
few; and fortifying his main army by the garri&s;ons, put
him&s;elf in a condition of pu&s;hing his conque&s;ts. Lou|vois,
hoping that the other provinces, weak and di&s;|mayed,
would prove an ea&s;y prey, advi&s;ed him to keep
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of places, which might afterwards &s;erve to
retain the people in &s;ubjection. His council was fol|lowed;
though it was found, &s;oon after, to have been
the mo&s;t impolitic.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;ternati|on of the Dutch.</NOTE> MEANWHILE the people, throughout all the Repub|lic,
in&s;tead of colecting a noble indignation again&s;t the
haughty conqueror, di&s;charged their rage upon their
own unhappy mini&s;ter, on who&s;e prudence and integrity
every one formerly be&s;towed the merited applau&s;e. The
bad condition of the armies was laid to his charge: The
ill choice of governors was a&s;cribed to his partiality:
As in&s;tances of cowardice multiplied, treachery was &s;u&s;|pected;
and his former connections with France being
remembered, the populace believed, that he and his
partizans had now combined to betray them to their
mo&s;t mortal enemy. The Prince of Orange, notwith|&s;tanding
his youth and inexperience, was looked on as
the only &s;aviour of the State; and men were violently
drove by their fears into his party, to which they had al|ways
been led by favour and inclination.</P>
<P>THE town of Am&s;terdam alone &s;eemed to retain &s;ome
courage; and by forming a regular plan of defence, en|deavoured
to infu&s;e &s;pirit into the other cities. The
magi&s;trates obliged the burge&s;&s;es to keep a &s;trict watch:
The populace, whom want of employment might en|gage
to mutiny, were maintained by regular pay, and
armed for the defence of the public. Some &s;hips, which
<PB N="501" REF="595">
lay u&s;ele&s;s in the harbour, were refitted, and &s;tationed
to guard the city: And the &s;luices being opened, the
neigbouring country, without regard to the great da|mage
&s;u&s;tained, was laid under water. All the province
followed this example, and &s;crupled not, in this extre|mity,
to re&s;tore to the &s;ea tho&s;e fertile fields, which
with infinite art and expence had been won from it.</P>
<P>THE States of Holland met to con&s;ider, whether any
means were left to &s;ave the remains of their lately flou|ri&s;hing,
and now di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Commonwealth. Though
they were &s;urrounded with waters, which barred all ac|ce&s;s
to the enemy, their deliberations were not con|ducted
with that tranquility, which could alone &s;ugge&s;t
mea&s;ures, proper to extricate them from their pre&s;ent
difficulties. The nobles gave their vote, that, provided
their religion, liberty, and &s;overeignty could be &s;aved,
every thing el&s;e &s;hould without &s;cruple be &s;acrificed to
the conqueror. Eleven towns concurred in the &s;ame
&s;entiments. Am&s;terdam &s;ingly declared again&s;t all trea|ty
with in&s;olent and triumphant enemies: But notwith|&s;tanding
that oppo&s;ition, amba&s;&s;adors were di&s;patched to
implore the pity of the two combined monarchs. It
was re&s;olved to &s;acrifice to Lewis Mae&s;tricht and all
the frontier towns, which lay without the bounds of
the &s;even provinces; and to pay him a large &s;um for
the charges of the war.</P>
<P>LEWIS deliberated with his mini&s;ters Louvois and
Pomponne, concerning the mea&s;ures which he &s;hould
embrace in the pre&s;ent emergence; and foutunately for
Europe, he &s;till preferred the violent councils of the
former. He offered to evacuate his conque&s;ts on condi|tions,
that all duties lately impo&s;ed on the commodi|ties
of France &s;hould be taken off; that the public ex|erci&s;e
of the Romi&s;h religion &s;hould be permitted;
the churches &s;hared with the Catholics, and their
<PB N="502" REF="596">
prie&s;ts maintained by appointments from the States;
that all the frontier towns of the Republic &s;hould be
re&s;igned to him, together with Nimeguen, Skink, Knot|zembourg,
and that part of Guelderland which lay on
the other &s;ide of the Rhine; as likewi&s;e the i&s;le of Bom|mel,
that of Voorn, the fortre&s;s of St. Andrews, that of
Louve&s;tein and Crevecoeur; that they &s;hould pay him
the &s;um of twenty millions of livres for the charges of
the war; that they &s;hould every year &s;end him a &s;olemn
emba&s;&s;y, and pre&s;ent him with a golden medal, as an ac|knowledgment,
that they owed to him the pre&s;ervation
of that liberty, which by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his predece&s;&s;ors
they had been able to acquire; and that they &s;hould
give entire &s;atisfaction to the King of England: And
he allowed them but ten days for the acceptance of the&s;e
exorbitant demands.</P>
<P>THE amba&s;&s;adors, who came to London, met with
&s;till wor&s;e reception: No mini&s;ter was allowed to treat
with them; and they were retained in a kind of con|finement.
But notwith&s;tanding this rigorous conduct
of the court, the pre&s;ence of the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors ex|cited
the &s;entiments of tender compa&s;&s;ion, and even in|dignation
among the people in general, but e&s;pecially
among tho&s;e who could fore&s;ee the aim and re&s;ult of
tho&s;e dangerous councils. The two mo&s;t powerful
monarchs, they &s;aid, in Europe, the one by land, the
other by &s;ea, have, contrary to the faith of &s;olemn trea|ties,
combined to exterminate an illu&s;trious Republic:
What a di&s;mal pro&s;pect does their &s;ucce&s;s afford to the
neighbours of the one, and to the &s;ubjects of the other?
Charles had formed the triple league, in order to re&s;train
the exorbitant power of France: A &s;ure proof, that he
does not now err from ignorance. He had courted and
obtained the applau&s;es of his people by that wi&s;e mea|&s;ure:
As he now adopts contrary councils, he mu&s;t &s;ure|ly
expect by their means to render him&s;elf independent
<PB N="503" REF="597">
of his people, who&s;e &s;entiments are become &s;o indiffe|rent
to him. During the mo&s;t entire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the
nation, and mo&s;t dutiful behaviour of the parliament,
dangerous projects, without provocation, are formed to
reduce them to &s;ubjection, and all the foreign intere&s;ts
of the people are &s;acrificed, in order the more &s;urely to
bereave them of their dome&s;tic liberties. Le&s;t any in|&s;tance
of freedom &s;hould remain within their view, the
United Provinces, the real barrier of England, mu&s;t be
abandoned to the mo&s;t dangerous enemy of England;
and by an univer&s;al combination of tyranny again&s;t laws
and liberty, all mankind, who have retained, in any de|gree,
their precious, though hitherto precarious, birth|rights,
are for ever to &s;ubmit to &s;lavery and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THOUGH the fear of giving offence to his confederate
had engaged Charles to treat the Dutch amba&s;&s;adors
with &s;uch rigour, he was not altogether withoiut unea|&s;ine&s;s,
on account of the rapid and unexpected progre&s;s
of the French arms. Were Holland entirely conquered,
its whole commerce and naval force, he &s;aw, mu&s;t be|come
an acce&s;&s;ion to France; the Spani&s;h Low Coun|tries
mu&s;t &s;oon follow; and Lewis, now independent
of his ally, would no longer think it his intere&s;t to &s;up|port
him again&s;t his di&s;contented &s;ubjects. Charles,
though he never &s;tretched his attention to very di&s;tant
con&s;equences, could not but fore&s;ee the&s;e obvious events;
and though incapable of envy or jealou&s;y, he was touch|ed
with anxiety, when he found every thing yield to the
French arms, while &s;uch vigorous re&s;i&s;tance was made
to his own. He &s;oon di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Dutch amba&s;&s;adords,
le&s;t they &s;hould cabal among his &s;ubjects, who bore them
great favour: But he &s;ent over Buckingham and Ar|lington,
and &s;oon after Lord Halifax, to negotiate anew
with the French King, in the pre&s;ent pro&s;perous &s;itua|tion
of that monarch's affairs.</P>
<P><PB N="504" REF="598">
THESE mini&s;ters pa&s;&s;ed through Holland; and as
they were &s;uppo&s;ed to bring peace to the di&s;tre&s;t Re|public,
they were received every where with the loude&s;t
acclamations. &startq;God ble&s;s the King of England! God
ble&s;s the Prince of Orange! Confu&s;ion to the States&endq;!
This was every where the cry of the populace. The
amba&s;&s;adors had &s;everal conferences with the States and
the Prince of Orange; but made no rea&s;onable advances
towards in accommodation. They went to Utrecht,
where they renewed the league with Lewis, and agreed,
that neither of the Kings &s;hould ever make peace with
Holland but by common con&s;ent. They next gave in
their preten&s;ions, of which the following are the prin|cipal
articles; that the Dutch &s;hould give up the ho|nour
of the flag, without the lea&s;t re&s;erve or limitation,
nor &s;hould whole fleets, even on the coa&s;t of Holland,
refu&s;e to &s;trike and lower their top&s;ails to the &s;malle&s;t
&s;hip, carrying the Briti&s;h flag; that all per&s;ons, guilty
of trea&s;on again&s;t the King, or of writing &s;editious li|bels,
&s;hould on complaint, be bani&s;hed for ever the do|minions
of the States; that the Dutch &s;hould pay the
King a million &s;terling towards the charges of the war,
together with ten thou&s;and pounds a year for permi&s;&s;ion
to fi&s;h on the Briti&s;h &s;eas; that they &s;hould &s;hare the
Indian trade with the Engli&s;h; that the Prince of
Orange and his de&s;cendants &s;hould enjoy the &s;overeignty
of the United Provinces; at lea&s;t, that they &s;hould be
inve&s;ted with the dignities of Stadtholder, Admiral, and
General, in as ample a manner as had ever been en|joyed
by any of his ance&s;tors; and that the i&s;le of Wal|cheren,
the city and ca&s;tle of Sluis, together with the
i&s;les of Cad&s;ant, Gor&eacute;e, and Vorne, &s;hould be put into
the King's hands, as a &s;ecurity for the performance of
articles. It is mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent with candour and rea&s;on
to &s;uppo&s;e, that Charles had not, in his alliance with
France, propo&s;ed the utter de&s;truction of the United
<PB N="505" REF="599">
Provinces; &s;ince &s;uch a &s;cheme is &s;carce compatible
with the project of employing the French power for ex|tending
his authority at home: But as the unexpected
progre&s;s of Lewis's arms had reduced the Hollanders to
the la&s;t extremity, the King was de&s;irous of acquiring
a con&s;iderable &s;hare of that rich booty, which fortune
had thrown into their hands.</P>
<P>THE terms propo&s;ed by Lewis bereaved the Repub|lic
of all &s;ecurity again&s;t any land inva&s;ion from France:
Tho&s;e demanded by Charles expo&s;ed them equally to an
inva&s;ion by &s;ea from England: And when both were
joined, they appeared ab&s;olutely intollerable, and reduced
the Hollanders, who &s;aw no means of defence, to the
utmo&s;t de&s;pair. What extremely augmented their di|&s;tre&s;s,
were the violent factions with which they conti|nued
to be every where agitated. De Wit, too perti|nacious
in defence of his own &s;y&s;tem of liberty, while
the very being of the Commonwealth was threatened,
&s;till per&s;erved in oppo&s;ing the repeal of the perpetual
edict, now become the object of horror to the Dutch
populace. Their rage at la&s;t broke all bounds, and bore
every thing before it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of June.</NOTE> They ro&s;e in an in&s;urrection at
Dort, and by force con&s;trained their burgo-ma&s;ters to
&s;ign the repeal, &s;o much demanded. This proved a
&s;ignal of a general revolt throughout all the provinces.</P>
<P>AT Am&s;terdam, the Hague, Middlebourg, Rotterdam,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince of O|range Stadt|holder.</NOTE>
the people flew to arms, and trampling under foot the au|thority
of their magi&s;trates, obliged them to &s;ubmit to the
Prince of Orange. They expelled from their office &s;uch
as di&s;plea&s;ed them: They required the Prince to appoint
others in their place: And agreeable to the proceedings
of the populace in all ages, provided they might wreak
their vengeance on their &s;uperiors, they expre&s;&s;ed a
great indifference for the protection of their civil li|berties.</P>
<P><PB N="506" REF="600">
THE &s;uperior talents and virtues of de Wit made him,
on this occa&s;ion, the chief object of general envy, and
expo&s;ed him to the utmo&s;t rage of popular prejudices.
Four a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins, actuated by no other motive than mi&s;taken
zeal, had a&s;&s;aulted him in the &s;treets; and after giving
him many wounds, had left him for dead. One of
them was puni&s;hed: The others were never que&s;tioned
for their crime. His brother Cornelius, who had behaved
with great prudence and courage on bond the fleet, was
obliged by &s;ickne&s;s to come a&s;hore, and he was now
confined to his hou&s;e at Dort. Some a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins broke in
upon him; and it was with the utmo&s;t difficulty that
his family and &s;ervants could repel their violence. At
Am&s;terdam, the hou&s;e of the brave de Ruyter, the &s;ole
re&s;ource of the di&s;tre&s;t Commonwealth, was &s;urrounded
by the enraged populace, and his wife and children were
for &s;ome time expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger.</P>
<P>ONE Tichelaer, a barber, a man noted for infamy, ac|cu&s;ed
Cornelius de Wit of endeavouring by bribes to en|gage
him in the de&s;ign of poi&s;oning the Prince of Orange.
The accu&s;ation, tho' attended with the mo&s;t improbable
and even ab&s;urd circum&s;tances, was greedily received by
the credulous multitude; and Cornelius was cited be|fore
a court of judicature. The judges, either blinded
by the &s;ame prejudices, or not daring to oppo&s;e the po|pular
torrent, condemned him to &s;uffer the que&s;tion.
This man, who had bravely &s;erved his country in war,
and who had been inve&s;ted with the highe&s;t dignities,
was delivered into the hands of the executioner, and
torn in pieces by the mo&s;t inhuman torments. Amid&s;t
the &s;evere agonies which he endured, he &s;till made pro|te&s;tations
of his innocence, and frequently repeated an
ode of Horace, which contained &s;entiments &s;uited to his

<P>THE judges, however, condemned him to lo&s;e his

this pro&s;ecution, re&s;olved not to de&s;ert him on account
of the unmerited infamy, which was endeavoured to be
thrown upon him. He came to his brother's pri&s;on, de|termined
to accompany him to the place of his exile.

of the multitude. They exerci&s;ed on the dead bodies of

recited; and till tired with their own fury, it was not
permitted the friends of the decea&s;ed to approach, or to
be&s;tow on them the honours of a funeral, &s;ilent and un|attended.</P>
<P>THE ma&s;&s;acre of the de Wits put an end for the time
to the remains of their party; and all men, from fear,
inclination, or prudence, concurred in expre&s;&s;ing the
mo&s;t implicit obedience to the Prince of Orange. The
Republic, tho' half &s;ubdued by foreign force, and as yet
di&s;mayed by its misfortunes, was firmly united under
one leader, and began to collect the remains of its an|tient
vigour. William,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Good con|duct of the Prince.</NOTE> worth of that heroic family
from which he &s;prung, adopted &s;entiments becoming the
head of a brave and free people. He bent all his efforts
again&s;t the public enemy: He fought not again&s;t his
country any advantages which might be dangerous to
civil liberty. Tho&s;e intolerable conditions, demanded by
their in&s;olent enemies, he exhorted the States to reject
with &s;corn; and by his advice they put an end to nego|tiations,
which &s;erved only to break the courage of their
fellow citizens, and delay the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their allies.
He &s;howed them, that the numbers and riches of the
people, aided by the advantages of nature, would &s;till
be &s;ufficient, if they abandoned not them&s;elves to de|&s;pair,
to re&s;i&s;t, at lea&s;t retard, the progre&s;s of their ene|mies,
and pre&s;eve the remaining provinces, till the
other nations of Europe, &s;en&s;ible of the common danger,
could come to their relief. He repre&s;ented, that as envy
of their opulence and liberty had produced this mighty
combination again&s;t them, they would in vain expect
by conce&s;&s;ions to &s;atisfy foes, who&s;e preten&s;ions were as
little bounded by moderation as by ju&s;tice. He exhort|ed
them to remember the generous valour of their an|ce&s;tors,
who, yet in the infancy of their State, preferred
liberty to every human con&s;ideration, and rouzing their
<PB N="509" REF="603">
&s;pirits to an ob&s;tinate defence, repelled all the power,
riches, and military di&s;cipline of Spain. And he pro|fe&s;&s;ed
him&s;elf willing to tread in the &s;teps of his illu&s;trious
predece&s;&s;ors, and hoped, that as they had honoured him
with the &s;ame affection which their ance&s;tors paid the
former Princes of Orange, they would &s;econd his efforts
with the &s;ame con&s;tancy and manly fortitude.</P>
<P>THE &s;pirit of the young Prince infu&s;ed it&s;elf into all
his hearers. Tho&s;e who lately entertained thoughts of
yielding their necks to &s;ubjection were now bravely de|termined
to re&s;i&s;t the haughty victor, and to defend tho&s;e
la&s;t remains of their native &s;oil, of which neither the ir|ruptions
of Lewis nor the innundation of waters had as
yet bereaved them. Should even the ground fail them
on which they might combat, they were &s;till re&s;olved
not to yield the generous &s;trife; but flying to their &s;et|tlements
in the Indies, erect a new empire in tho&s;e re|mote
regions, and pre&s;erve alive, even in the climates of
&s;lavery, that liberty, of which Europe was become un|worthy.
Already they concerted mea&s;ures for executing
this extraordinary re&s;olution; and found, that the ve&s;&s;els
contained in their harbours could tran&s;port above two
hundred thou&s;and inhabitants to the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>THE combined Princes, finding at la&s;t &s;ome appearance
of oppo&s;ition, bent al their efforts to &s;educe the Prince
of Orange, on who&s;e valour and conduct the fate of the
Commonwealth entirely depended. The &s;overeignty of
the province of Holland was offered him, and the pro|tection
of England and France, to in&s;ure him, as well
again&s;t the inva&s;ion of foreign enemies, as the in&s;ur|rection
of his &s;ubjects. All propo&s;als were generou&s;ly
rejected; and the Prince declared his re&s;olution to retire
into Germany, and to pa&s;s his life in hunting on his
lands there, rather than abandon the liberty of his coun|try,
or betray the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. When Buck|ingham
<PB N="510" REF="604">
urged the inevitable de&s;truction which hung over
the United Provinces, and a&s;ked him, whether he did
not &s;ee, that the Commonwealth was ruined; <HI>There is
one certain means,</HI> replied the Prince, <HI>by which I can be
&s;ecure never to &s;ee my country's ruin: I will die in the la&s;t
ditch.</HI></P>
<P>THE people in Holland had been much incited to
e&s;pou&s;e the Prince's party, by the hopes, that the King
of England, plea&s;ed with his nephew's advancement,
would abandon tho&s;e dangerous engagements, into
which he had entered, and would afford his protection
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Republic. But all the&s;e hopes were
&s;oon found to be fallacious. Charles &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in
his alliance with France; and the combined fleets ap|proached
the coa&s;t of Holland, with an Engli&s;h army on
board, commanded by Count Schomberg. It is pre|tended,
that an unu&s;ual tide carried them off the coa&s;t,
and that Providence thus interpo&s;ed, in an extraordinary
manner, to &s;ave the Republic from the imminent danger
to which it was expo&s;ed. Very tempe&s;tuous weather,
it is certain, prevailed all the re&s;t of the &s;ea&s;on; and
the combined fleets either were blown to a di&s;tance, or
dared not to approach a &s;hore, which might prove fatal
to them. Lewis, finding that his enemies gathered cou|rage
behind their inundations, and that no farther pro|gre&s;s
was likely for the pre&s;ent to attend his arms, had
retired to Ver&s;ailles.</P>
<P>THE other nations of Europe regarded the &s;ubjection
of Holland as the forerunner of their own &s;lavery, and
retained no hopes of defending them&s;elves, &s;hould &s;uch
a mighty acce&s;&s;ion be made to the already exorbitant
power of France. The Emperor, though he lay at a
di&s;tance, and was naturally &s;low in his undertakings,
began to put him&s;elf in motion; Brandenburgh &s;hewed
a di&s;po&s;ition to take party with the States; Spain had
<PB N="511" REF="605">
&s;ent &s;ome forces to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and by the pre&s;ent
efforts of the Prince of Orange, and the pro&s;pect of re|lief
from their allies, a different face of affairs began al|ready
to appear. Groninghen was the fir&s;t place which
&s;topped the progre&s;s of the enemy: The bi&s;hop of Mun|&s;ter
was repul&s;ed from that town, and obliged to rai&s;e
the &s;iege with lo&s;s and di&s;honour. Naerden was at|tempted
by the Prince of Orange; but Mare&s;chal Lux|embourg,
breaking in upon his entrenchments with a
&s;udden irruption, obliged him to abandon the enterprize.</P>
<P>THERE was no ally on whom the Dutch more relied
for a&s;&s;i&s;tance than the parliament of England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1673.</NOTE> which the
King's nece&s;&s;ities at la&s;t obliged him to a&s;&s;emble.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of Fe|bruary. A parlia|ment.</NOTE> The eyes
of all men, both abroad and at home, were fixed on this
&s;e&s;&s;ion, which met after prorogations continued for near
two years. It was evident how much the King dreaded
the a&s;&s;embling his parliament; and the di&s;contents uni|ver&s;ally
excited by the bold mea&s;ures entered into both
in foreign and dome&s;tic admini&s;tration, had given but
too ju&s;t foundation for his apprehen&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE King, however, in his &s;peech, addre&s;&s;ed them
with all the appearance of cordiality and confidence.
He &s;aid, that he would have a&s;&s;embled them &s;ooner, had
he not been de&s;irous to allow them lei&s;ure for attending
their private affairs, as well as to give his people re&s;pite
from taxes and impo&s;itions: That &s;ince their la&s;t meet|ing,
he had been forced into a war, not only ju&s;t but
nece&s;&s;ary, nece&s;&s;ary both for the honour and intere&s;t of
the nation: That in order to have peace at home, while
he had war abroad, he had i&s;&s;ued his declaration of indul|gence
to di&s;&s;enters, and had found many good effects to
re&s;ult from that mea&s;ure: That he heard of &s;ome ex|ceptions
which had been taken to this exerci&s;e of power;
but he would tell them plainly, that he was re&s;olved to
<PB N="512" REF="606">
&s;tick to his declaration; and would be much offended
at any contradiction: and that though a rumour had
been &s;pread, as if the new levied army had been intend|ed
to controul law and property, he regarded that jea|lou&s;y
as &s;o frivolous, that he was re&s;olved to augment
his forces next &s;pring, and did not doubt but they would
con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity of them in their &s;upplies. The
re&s;t of the bu&s;ine&s;s he left to the chancellor.</P>
<P>THE chancellor enlarged on the &s;ame topics, and
added many extraoridinary po&s;itions of his own. He
told them, that the Hollanders were the common ene|mies
of all monarchies, e&s;pecially that of England, their
only competitor for commerce and naval power, and the
&s;ole ob&s;tacle to their views of an univer&s;al empire, as ex|ten&s;ive
as that of antient Rome: That even during their
pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s and danger, they were &s;o intoxicated with
the&s;e ambitious projects, as to &s;light all treaty, nay, to
refu&s;e al ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities: That the King, in en|tering
on this war, did no more than pro&s;ecute tho&s;e
maxims, which had engaged the parliament to advi&s;e
and approve of the la&s;t; and he might therefore &s;afely
&s;ay, that <HI>it was their war:</HI> That the States being the
eternal enemies of England, both by intere&s;t and incli|nation,
the parliament had wi&s;ely judged it nece&s;&s;ary to
extirpate them, and had laid it down as an eternal max|im,
that <HI>delenda e&s;t Carthago,</HI> this ho&s;tile government by
all means is to be &s;ubverted: And that tho' the Dutch
pretended to have a&s;&s;urances, that the parliament would
furni&s;h no &s;upplies to the King, he was confident, that
this hope, in which they extremely tru&s;ted, would &s;oon
fail them.</P>
<P>BEFORE the Commons entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s, there
lay before them an affair, which di&s;covered, beyond a
po&s;&s;ibility of doubt, the arbitrary projects of the King;
and the mea&s;ures taken upon it, proved, that the hou&s;e
<PB N="513" REF="607">
was not at pre&s;ent in a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to them. It
had been the con&s;tant undi&s;puted practice, ever &s;ince
the parliament in 1604, for the hou&s;e, in ca&s;e of any
vacancy, to i&s;&s;ue out writs for new elections; and the
Chancellor, who, before that time, had had &s;ome pre|cedents
in his favour, had ever afterwards ab&s;tained from
all exerci&s;e of that authority. This indeed was one of
the fir&s;t &s;teps, which the Commons had taken in e&s;ta|bli&s;hing
and guarding their privileges; and nothing
could be more requi&s;ite than this precaution, in order to
prevent the clande&s;tine i&s;&s;uing of writs, and to en&s;ure a
fair and free election. No one but &s;o de&s;perate a mini|&s;ter
as Shafte&s;bury, who had entered into a regular plan
for reducing the people to &s;ubjection, could have enter|tained
thoughts of breaking in upon a practice &s;o rea&s;on|able
and &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;hed, or could have hoped to &s;uc|ceed
in &s;o bold an enterprize. Several members had
taken their &s;eats upon irregular writs i&s;&s;ued by the
Chancellor; but the hou&s;e was no &s;ooner a&s;&s;embled,
and the Speaker placed in his chair, than a motion was
made again&s;t them; and the members them&s;elves had
the mode&s;ty to withdraw. Their election was declared
null; and new writs, in the u&s;ual form, were i&s;&s;ued by
the Speaker.</P>
<P>THE next &s;tep taken by the Commons had the ap|pearance
of &s;ome more complai&s;ance; but in reality
proceeded form the &s;ame &s;pirit of liberty and indepen|dence.
They re&s;olved, in order to &s;upply his Maje&s;ty's
extraordinary occa&s;ions, for that was the expre&s;&s;ion
they u&s;ed, to grant eighteen months a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, at the
rate of 70,000 pounds a month, amounting in the whole
to 1,260,000 pounds. Though unwilling to come to a
violent breach with the King, they would not expre&s;s
the lea&s;t approbation of the war; and they gave him
the pro&s;pect of this &s;upply, only that they might have
<PB N="514" REF="608">
permi&s;&s;ion to proceed peaceably in the redre&s;s of &s;ome
other grievances, of which they had &s;uch rea&s;on to com|plain.</P>
<P>NO grievance was more alarming, both on account of
the &s;ecret views from which it proceeded, and the con|&s;equences which might attend it, than the declaration
of indulgence. A remon&s;trance was immediately formed
again&s;t that exerci&s;e of prerogative. The King defended
his mea&s;ure. The Commons per&s;i&s;ted in their oppo&s;i|tion
to it; and they repre&s;ented, that &s;uch a practice,
if admitted, might tend to interrupt the free cour&s;e of
the laws, and alter the legi&s;lative power, which had al|ways
been acknowledged to re&s;ide in the King and the
two hou&s;es. All the world was in expectation, with re|gard
to the i&s;&s;ue of this extraordinary affair. The King
&s;eemed engaged in honour to &s;upport his mea&s;ure; and
in order to obviate all oppo&s;ition, he had po&s;itively de|clared
that he would &s;upport it. The Commons were
obliged to per&s;evere, not only becau&s;e it was di&s;honour|abnle
to be foiled, where they could plead &s;uch &s;trong
rea&s;ons, but al&s;o becau&s;e, if the King prevailed in his
preten&s;ions, an end &s;eemed to be put to all the legal li|mitations
of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that the King was now come to that
delicate cri&s;is, which he ought at fir&s;t to have fore&s;een,
when he embraced tho&s;e de&s;perate councils; and his re|&s;olutions,
in &s;uch an event, ought long ago to have
been entirely fixed and determined. Be&s;ides his u&s;ual
guards, he had an army encamped at Blackheath under
the command of Mare&s;chal Schomberg, a foreigner;
and many of the officers were of the catholic religion.
His ally, the French king, he might expect, would &s;e|cond
him, if violence became requi&s;ite for re&s;training
his di&s;contented &s;ubjects, and &s;upporting the mea&s;ures,
which by common con&s;ent they had agreed to pur&s;ue.
<PB N="515" REF="609">
But Charles was &s;tartled, when he approached &s;o dan|gerous
a precipice, as that which lay before him. Were
violence once offered, there could be no return, he &s;aw,
of mutual confidence and tru&s;t with his people; the pe|rils
attending foreign &s;uccours, e&s;pecially from &s;o
mighty a prince, were &s;ufficiently apparent; and the
&s;ucce&s;s which his own arms had met with in the war
was not &s;o great, as to increa&s;e his authority, or terrify
the melacontents from oppo&s;ition. The de&s;ire of power
likewi&s;e, which had engaged Charles in the&s;e precipi|tant
mea&s;ures, had le&s;s proceeded, we may ob&s;erve,
from ambition than from love of ea&s;e. Strict limitations
of the con&s;titution rendered the government complicated
and trouble&s;ome; and it was impo&s;&s;ible for him, with|out
much contrivance and intrigue, to procure the
money nece&s;&s;ary for his plea&s;ures, or even for the regu|lar
&s;upport of the government. When the pro&s;pect,
therefore, of &s;uch dangerous oppo&s;ition pre&s;ented it&s;elf,
the &s;ame love of ea&s;e inclined him to retract what it
&s;eemed &s;o difficult to maintain; and his turn of mind,
naturally pliant and carele&s;s, made him find little ob|jection
to a mea&s;ure, which a more haughty prince
would have embraced with the utmo&s;t reluctance. That
he might yield with the better grace, he a&s;ked the opi|nion
of the Hou&s;e of Peers, who advi&s;ed him to comply
with the Commons. And accordingly the King &s;ent<NOTE PLACE="marg">Declaration of indulgence recalled.</NOTE>
for the declaration, and with his own hands broke the
&s;eals. The Commons expre&s;&s;ed the utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction
with this mea&s;ure, and the mo&s;t entire duty to his
Maje&s;ty. The King a&s;&s;ured them, that he would will|ingly
pa&s;s any law, offered him, which might tend to
give them &s;atisfaction in all their ju&s;t grievances.</P>
<P>SHAFTESBURY, when he &s;aw the King recede at
once from &s;o capital a point, which he had publicly de|clared
his re&s;olution to maintain, concluded, that all
the &s;chemes for enlarging royal authority were vani&s;hed,
<PB N="516" REF="610">
and that Charles was utterly incapable of pur&s;uing &s;uch
difficlt and &s;uch dangerous mea&s;ures. The parliament,
he fore&s;aw, might pu&s;h their enquiries into tho&s;e coun|cils,
which were &s;o generally odious; and the King,
from the &s;ame facility of di&s;po&s;ition, might abandon his
mini&s;ters to their vengeance. He was re&s;olved, there|fore,
to make his peace in time with that party, which
was likely to predominate and to atone for all his vio|lences
in favour of monarchy, by like violences in op|po&s;ition
to it. Never turn was more &s;uddedn, or le&s;s
calculated to &s;ave appearances. Immediately he entered
into all the cabals of the country party; and di&s;covered
to them, perhaps magnified, the arbitrary councils of
the court, in which he him&s;elf had borne &s;o deep a
&s;hare. He was received with open arms by that party,
who &s;tood in need of &s;o able a leader; and no que&s;tions
were a&s;ked with regard to his late apo&s;tacy. The vari|ous
factions, into which the nation had been divided,
and the many &s;udden revolutions to which the public
had been expo&s;ed, had tended much to debauch the
minds of men, and to de&s;troy the &s;en&s;e of honour and
decorum in their public conduct.</P>
<P>BUT the parliament, though &s;atisfied with the King's
compliance, had not lo&s;t all tho&s;e apprehen&s;ions, to
which the mea&s;ures of the court had given &s;o much
foundation. A law pa&s;&s;ed for impo&s;ing a <HI>te&s;t</HI> on all
who &s;hould enjoy any public office. Be&s;ides taking the
oaths of allegiance and &s;upremacy, and receiving the &s;a|crament
in the e&s;tabli&s;hed church; they were obliged to
abjure all belief in the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation.
As the di&s;&s;enters had &s;econded the efforts of the Com|mons
again&s;t the King's declaration of indulgence, and
&s;eemed re&s;olute to accept of no toleration in an illegal
manner, they had acquired great favour with the par|liament,
and a project was adopted to unite the whole
prote&s;tant intere&s;t again&s;t the common enemy, who now
<PB N="517" REF="611">
began to appear formidable. A bill pa&s;&s;ed the Com|mons
for the ea&s;e and relief of the prote&s;tant noncon|formi&s;ts;
but met with &s;ome difficulties, at lea&s;t delays,
in the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>THE re&s;olution for &s;upply was carried into a law;
as a recompence to the King for his conce&s;&s;ions. A
general pardon likewi&s;e and indemnity was pa&s;&s;ed, which
&s;creened the mini&s;ters from all farther enquiry. The
parliament probably thought that the be&s;t method of re|claiming
the criminals, was to &s;hew them, that their ca&s;e
was not de&s;perate. Even the remon&s;trance, which the
Commons voted of their grievances, may be regarded as
a proof, that their anger was, for the time, appea&s;ed.
None of the capital points are touched on; the breach
of the triple league, the French alliance, the &s;hutting
up the Exchequer. The &s;ole grievances mentioned are
an arbitrary impo&s;ition on coals for providing convoys,
the exerci&s;e of military law, the quartering and pre&s;&s;ing
of &s;oldiers; and they prayed, that, after the conclu&s;ion
of the war, the whole army &s;hould be di&s;banded. The
King gave them a gracious, though eva&s;ive an&s;wer.
When bu&s;ine&s;s was fini&s;hed, the two Hou&s;es adjourned
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THOUGH the King had, for the time, receded from<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of March.</NOTE>
his declaration of indulgence, and thereby had tacitly
relingui&s;hed the &s;u&s;pending power, he was &s;till re&s;olved,
notwith&s;tanding his bad &s;ucce&s;s both at home and
abroad, to per&s;erve in his alliance with France, and in
the Dutch was, and con&s;equently in all tho&s;e &s;ecret
views, whatever they were, which depended on tho&s;e
fatal mea&s;ures. The money, granted by parliament,
&s;ufficed to equip a fleet, of which Prince Rupert was
declared Admiral: For the Duke was &s;er a&s;ide by the
te&s;t. Sir Edward Sprague and the Earl of O&s;&s;ory com|manded

&s;et &s;ail towards the coa&s;t of Holland, and found the
enemy, lying at anchor, within the &s;ands at Schonvelt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of May Sea-fight.</NOTE>
There is a natural confu&s;ion attending &s;ea-fights, even
beyond other military tran&s;actions; derived from the
precarious operations of winds and tides, as well as
from the &s;moke and darkne&s;s, in which every thing is
there involved. No wonder, therefore, that relations
of the&s;e battles are apt to contain uncertainties and con|tradictions;
e&s;pecially when compo&s;ed by writers of the
ho&s;tile nations, who take plea&s;ure in exalting their own
advantages, and &s;uppre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e of the enemy. All
we can &s;ay with certainty of this battle, is, that both
&s;ides boa&s;ted of the victory; and we may thence infer,
that the action was not deci&s;ive. The Dutch, being near
home, retired into their own harbours. In a week, they
were refitted, and pre&s;ented them&s;elves again to the com|bined
fleets. A new action en&s;ued, not more deci&s;ive than
the foregoing.<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of June. Another &s;ea-fights.</NOTE> It was not fought with great ob&s;tinacy on
either &s;ide; but whether the Dutch or the alllies fir&s;t retir|ed
&s;eems to be a matter of uncertainty. The lo&s;s in the
former of the&s;e actions fell chiefly on the French, whom
the Engli&s;h, diffident of their intentions, took care to
place under their own &s;quadrons; and they thereby ex|po&s;ed
them to all the fire of the enemy. There &s;eems
not to have been a &s;hip lo&s;t on either &s;ide in the &s;econd
engagement.</P>
<P>IT was &s;ufficient glory to de Ruyter, that with a fleet
much inferior to the combined &s;uadrons of France and
England, he could fight without any notable di&s;advan|tage;
and it was &s;ufficient vicotry, that he could defeat
the project of a de&s;cent in Zealand, which, had it
taken place, had endangered, in the pre&s;ent circum|&s;tances,
the total overthrow of the Dutch common|wealth.
Prince Rupert al&s;o was &s;u&s;pected not to favour
<PB N="519" REF="613">
the King's projects of &s;ubduing Holland, or enlarging his
authority at home; and from the&s;e motives, he was
thought not to have pre&s;&s;ed &s;o hard on the enemy, as
his well-known valour gave rea&s;on to expect. It is in|deed
remarkable, that, during this war, thought the
Engli&s;h with their allies much over-matched the Hol|landers,
they were not able to gain any advantage over
them; while in the former war, though often over-born
by numbers, they &s;till exerted them&s;elves with the
mo&s;t heroic courage, and always acquired great re|nown,
&s;ometimes even &s;ignal victories. But they were
di&s;gu&s;ted with the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, which they e&s;teem|ed
pernicious to their country; they were not &s;atisfied
in the ju&s;tice of the quarrel; and they entertained a
perpectual jealou&s;y of their confederates, whom, had
they been permitted, they would with much more
plea&s;ure have de&s;troyed than even the enemy them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF Prince Rupert was not favourable to the de&s;igns
of the court, he enjoyed as little favour from the
court, at lea&s;t from the Duke, who, though he could
no longer command the fleet, &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;ed the chief
authority in the Admiralty. The Prince complained of
a total want of every thing, powder, &s;hot, provi&s;ions,
beer, and even water; and he went into harbour, that
he might refit the fleet, and &s;upply its numerous ne|ce&s;&s;ities.
After &s;ome weeks he was refitted; and he
again put to &s;ea. The ho&s;tile fleets met at the mouth
of the Texel, and fought the la&s;t battle, which, during a<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of Augu&s;t. Another $word$ fight.</NOTE>
cour&s;e of &s;o many years, the&s;e neighbouring maritime
powers have di&s;puted with each other. De Ruyter,
and under him Tromp, commanded the Dutch in this
action, as in the two former: For the Prince of
Orange had reconciled the&s;e two gallant rivals; and
they retained nothing of their former animo&s;ity, except
<PB N="520" REF="614">
that emulation, which mades them exert them&s;elves
with more di&s;tingui&s;hed bravery again&s;t the enemies of
their country. Brankert was oppo&s;ed to d'Etre&eacute;s, de
Ruyter to Prince Rupert, Tromp to Sprague. It is
remarkable, that in all actions the&s;e brave admirals la&s;t
mentioned had &s;till &s;eleted each other, as the only an|tagoni&s;ts
worthy each others valour; and no deci&s;ive
advantage had as yet been gained by either of them.
They fought in this battle, as if there were no mean
between death and victory.</P>
<P>D'ETREES and all the French &s;quadron, except Rear
Admiral Martel, kept at a di&s;tance; and Brankert, in|&s;tead
of pre&s;&s;ing on them, bore down to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of de Ruyter, who was engaged in furious combat with
Prince Rupert. On no occa&s;ion did the Prince acquire
more de&s;erved honour: His conduct, as well as valour,
&s;hone out with &s;ignal lu&s;tre. Having di&s;engaged his
&s;quadron from the numerous enemies, with which he
was every where &s;urrounded, and having joined Sir
John Chichely, his Rear Admiral, who had been &s;epa|rated
from him, he made ha&s;te to the relief of Sprague,
who was very hard pre&s;&s;ed by Tromp's &s;quadron. The
Royal Prince, in which Sprague fir&s;t engaged, was &s;o
di&s;abled, that he was obliged to hoi&s;t his flag on board
the St. George; while Tromp was for a like rea&s;on
obliged to quit his &s;hip, the Golden Lion, and go on
board the Comet. The fight was renewed with the
utmo&s;t fury by the&s;e valorous rivals, and by the Rear
Admirals, their &s;econds. O&s;&s;ory, Rear Admiral to
Sprague, was preparing to board Tromp, when he &s;aw
the St. George terribly torn, and in a manner di&s;abled.
Sprague was leaving her in order to hoi&s;t his flag on
board a third &s;hip, and return to the charge; when a
&s;hot, which had pa&s;&s;ed through the St. George, took
<PB N="521" REF="615">
his boat, and &s;unk her. The Admiral was drowned, to
the great regret of Tromp him&s;elf, who be&s;towed on
his valour the de&s;erved prai&s;es.</P>
<P>PRINCE Rupert found affairs in this dangerous &s;itua|tion,
and &s;aw mo&s;t of the &s;hips in Sprague's &s;quadron
di&s;abled from fight. The engagement was renewed,
and became very clo&s;e and bloody. The Prince threw
the enemy into great di&s;order. To increa&s;e it, he &s;ent
among them two fire-&s;hips; and at the &s;ame time made
a &s;ignal to the French to bear down, which if they had
done, a total victory mu&s;t have en&s;ued. But the
Prince, when he &s;aw that they neglected his &s;ignal,
and ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of his &s;hips were in no condi|tion
to keep the &s;ea long, wi&s;ely provided for their
&s;afety by making ea&s;y &s;ail towards the Engli&s;h coa&s;t.
The victory in this battle was as doubtful, as in all
the actions fought during the pre&s;ent war.</P>
<P>THE turn, which the affairs of the Hollanders took
by land, was more favourable. The Prince of Orange
be&s;ieged and took Naerden; and from this &s;ucce&s;s gave
his country rea&s;on to hope for &s;till more pro&s;perous en|terprizes.
Montecuculi, who commanded the Imperia|li&s;ts
on the Upper Rhine, deceived, by the mo&s;t artful
conduct, the vigilance and penetration of Turenne,
and making a &s;udden march, &s;at down before Bonne.
The Prince of Orange's conduct was no le&s;s ma&s;terly;
while he eluded all the French generals, and leaving
them behind him, joined his army to that of the Impe|riali&s;ts.
Bonne was taken in a few days: Several
other places of the Electorate of Cologne fell into the
hands of the allies: And the communication being
thus cut off between France and the United Provinces,
Lewis was obliged to recal his forces, and to aban|don
all his conque&s;ts, with greater rapidity than he
<PB N="522" REF="616">
had at fir&s;t made them. The taking Mae&s;tricht was
the only advantage, which he gained this campaign.</P>
<P>A CONGRESS was opened at Cologne under the me|diation
of Sweden; but with &s;mall hopes of &s;ucce&s;s.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Congre&s;s of Cologne.</NOTE>
The demands of the two Kings were &s;uch as mu&s;t have
reduced the Hollanders to perpetual &s;ervitude. In pro|portion
as the affairs of the States ro&s;e, the Kings &s;unk
in their demands; but the States &s;till &s;unk lower in
their offers; and it was impo&s;&s;ible for the parties ever
to agree on any conditions. After the French eva|cuated
Holland, the congre&s;s broke up; and the &s;eizure
of Prince William of Fur&s;tenburg by the Imperiali&s;ts,
afforded the French and Engli&s;h a good pretence for
leaving Cologne. The Dutch amba&s;&s;adors in their me|morials
expre&s;&s;ed all the haughtine&s;s and di&s;dain, &s;o
natural to a free State, which had met with &s;uch un|merited
ill u&s;age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">20th of Oc|tober. A parlia|ment.</NOTE> THE Parliament of England was now a&s;&s;embled,
and di&s;covered much greater &s;ymptoms of ill humour,
than had appeared in their la&s;t meeting. They had
&s;een for &s;ome time a negotiation of marriage carried on
between the Duke of York and the Archduche&s;s of
Im&s;pruc, a catholic of the Au&s;trian family; and they
had made no oppo&s;ition. But when that intention
failed, and the Duke applied to a Prince&s;s of the hou&s;e
of Modena, then in clo&s;e conjunction with France;
this circum&s;tance, joined to &s;o many other grounds of
di&s;content, rai&s;ed the Commons into a flame; and they
remon&s;trated with teh greate&s;t zeal again&s;t the intended
marriage. The King told them, that their remon|&s;trance
came too late; and that the marriage was al|ready
agreed on, and even celebrated by proxy. The
Commons &s;till in&s;i&s;ted; and proceeding to the exami|nation
of the other parts of government, they voted the
<PB N="523" REF="617">
&s;tanding army to be a grievance, and declared, that
they would grant no more &s;upply, unle&s;s it appeared,
that the Dutch were &s;o ob&s;tinate as to refu&s;e all rea|&s;onable
conditions. To cut &s;hort the&s;e di&s;agreeable at|tacks,
the King re&s;olved to prorogue the Parliament;<NOTE PLACE="marg">4th of No|vember.</NOTE>
and with that intention he came unexpectedly to the
Hou&s;e of Peers, and &s;ent the u&s;her to &s;ummon the
Commons. It happened, that the &s;peaker and the
u&s;her nearly met at the door of the hou&s;e; but the
&s;peaker being within, &s;ome of the members &s;uddenly
&s;hut the door, and cried, <HI>To the chair, to the chair:</HI> while
others cried, <HI>The black-rod is at the door.</HI> The &s;peaker
was hurried to the chair; and the following motions
were in&s;tantly made: That the alliance with France is
a grievance; that the evil coun&s;ellors about the King
are a grievance; that the Duke of Lauderdale is a
grievance, and not fit to be tru&s;ted or employed. There
was a general cry, <HI>To the que&s;tion, to the que&s;tion:</HI> But
the u&s;her knocking violently at the door, the &s;peaker
leaped from the chair, and the hou&s;e ro&s;e in great con|fu&s;ion.</P>
<P>DURING the interval, Shafte&s;bury, who&s;e intrigues
with the malecontent party were now become notorious,
was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the office of Chancellor; and the
&s;eals were given to Sir Heneage Finch, under the title
of Lord Keeper. The te&s;t had incapacitated Clifford;
and the white &s;taff was conferred on Sir Thomas O&s;|borne,
&s;oon after created Earl of Danby, a mini&s;ter of
ability, who had ri&s;en by his parliamentary talents.
Clifford retired into the country, and &s;oon after died.</P>
<P>THE Parliament had been prorogued,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674.</NOTE> in order to
give the Duke lei&s;ure to con&s;ummate his marriage;<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> but
the King's nece&s;&s;ities &s;oon obliged him again to a&s;|&s;emble
<PB N="524" REF="618">
them; and by &s;ome popular acts he paved the
way for the &s;e&s;&s;ions. But all his efforts were in vain.
The di&s;gu&s;t of the Commons was fixed on foundations
too deep to be ea&s;ily removed. They began with ap|plications
for a general fa&s;t; by which they intimated,
that the nation was in a very calamitous condition:
They addre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the King's guards, which they
repre&s;ented as dangerous to liberty, and even as illegal,
&s;ince they had never yet received the &s;anction of par|liament:
They took &s;ome &s;teps towards e&s;tabli&s;hing a
new and more rigorous te&s;t again&s;t popery: And what
chiefly alarmed the court, they made an attack on the
members of the cabal, to who&s;e pernicous councils they
ju&s;tly imputed all their pre&s;ent grievances. Clifford
was dead: Shafte&s;bury had made his peace with the
country party, and was become their leader: Buck|ingham
was endeavouring to imitate Shafte&s;bury; but
his intentions were as yet known to very few. A mo|tion
was therefore made in the hou&s;e of Commons for
his impeachment: He de&s;ired to be heard at the bar;
but expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in &s;o confu&s;ed and ambiguous a
manner, as gave little &s;atisfaction. He was required to
an&s;wer preci&s;ely to certain queries, which they propo&s;ed
to him. The&s;e queries regarded all the articles of mi&s;con|duct
above-mentioned; and among the re&s;t, the follow|ing
one &s;eems remarkable. &startq;By who&s;e advice was the
army brought up to over-awe the debates and re&s;o|lutions
of the Hou&s;e of Commons?&endq; This &s;hews to
what length the &s;u&s;picions of the hou&s;e were at that
timne carried. Buckingham, in all his an&s;wers, endea|voured
to exculpate him&s;elf, and to load Arlignton.
He &s;ucceeded not in the former intention: The Com|mons
voted an addre&s;s for his removal. But Arlington,
who was on many accounts obnoxious to the hou&s;e,
<PB N="525" REF="619">
was attacked. Articles were drawn up again&s;t him;
though the impeachment was never pro&s;ecuted.</P>
<P>THE King plainly &s;aw, that he could expect no &s;up|ply
from the Commons for carrying on a war, which
was &s;o odious to them. He re&s;olved therefore to make
a &s;eparate peace with the Dutch, on the terms which
they had propo&s;ed through the canal of the Spani&s;h
amba&s;&s;ador. With a cordiality, which, in the pre&s;ent
di&s;po&s;ition on both &s;ides, was probably but affected, but
which was obliging, he a&s;ked advice of the Parliament.
The Parliament unanimou&s;ly concurred, both in thanks
for this gracious conde&s;cen&s;ion, and in their advice for
peace. Peace was accordingly concluded. The ho|nour
of the flag was yielded by the Dutch in the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive terms: A regulation of trade was agreed to:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace with Holland.</NOTE>
All po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were re&s;tored to the &s;ame condition as
before the war: The Engli&s;h planters in Surinam were
allowed to remove at plea&s;ure: And the States agreed
to pay to the King the &s;um of eight hundred thou&s;and
patacoons, near three hundred thou&s;and pounds. Four<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE>
days after the Parliament was prorogued, the peace
was proclaimed in London, to the great joy of the
people. Spain had declared, that &s;he could no longer
&s;tand neuter, if ho&s;tilities were continued agai&s;t Hol|land;
and a great decay of trade was fore&s;een, in ca&s;e
a rupture &s;hould en&s;ue with that nation. The pro&s;|pect
of this lo&s;s contributed very much to increa&s;e the
national aver&s;ion to the pre&s;ent war, and to enliven the
joy for its conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE was in the French &s;ervice a large body of
Engli&s;h to the number of ten thou&s;and men, which
had acquired great honour in every action, and had
contributed greatly to the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of Lewis. The&s;e
<PB N="526" REF="620">
troops, Charles &s;aid he was bound by treaty not to
recall; but he obliged him&s;elf to the States by a &s;e|cret
article not to allow them to be recruited. His
partiality to France prevented a &s;trict execution of
this article.</P>
