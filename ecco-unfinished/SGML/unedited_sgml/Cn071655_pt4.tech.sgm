of LIFE.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>JOB x. I.</BIBL>
<Q>My &s;oul is weary of my life.&mdash;</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>JOB, in the fir&s;t part of his days, was
<HI>the greate&s;t of all the men of the Ea&s;t.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM I.</NOTE>
His po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions were large; his family
was numerous and flouri&s;hing; his own
character was fair and blamele&s;s. Yet
this man it plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it with
extraordinary rever&s;es of fortune. He
was robbed of his whole &s;ub&s;tance. His
&s;ons and daughters all peri&s;hed; and he
<PB N="2" REF="11">
him&s;elf, fallen from his high e&s;tate, child|le&s;s
and reduced to poverty, was &s;mitten
with &s;ore di&s;ea&s;e. His friends came a|bout
him, &s;eemingly with the purpo&s;e of
admini&s;tering comfort. But from a har&s;h
and ill-founded con&s;truction of the in|tention
of Providence in his di&s;a&s;ters,
they only added to his &s;orrows by un|ju&s;t
upbraiding. Hence tho&s;e many pa|thetic
lamentations with which this book
abounds, poured forth in the mo&s;t beau|tiful
and touching &s;train of Oriental poe|try.
In one of tho&s;e hours of lamenta|tion,
the &s;entiment in the text was utter|ed;
<HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life;</HI> a &s;en|timent,
which &s;urely, if any &s;ituation
can ju&s;tify it, was allowable in the ca&s;e
of Job.</P>
<P>In &s;ituations very different from that
of Job, under calamities far le&s;s &s;evere,
it is not uncommon to find &s;uch a &s;en|timent
working in the heart, and &s;ome|times
breaking forth from the lips of
men. Many, very many there are, who
on one occa&s;ion or other, have experien|ced
<PB N="3" REF="12">
this wearine&s;s of life, and been tempt|ed
to wi&s;h that it would come to a clo&s;e.
Let us now examine in what circum&s;tan|ces
this feeling may be deemed excu&s;e|able;
in what it is to be held &s;inful;
and under what re&s;tractions we may, on
any occa&s;ion, be permitted to &s;ay, <HI>My
&s;oul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL con&s;ider the words of the text
in three lights; as expre&s;&s;ing, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The
&s;entiment of a di&s;contented man; <HI>Second|ly,</HI>
The &s;entiment of an afflicted man;
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> The &s;entiment of a devout man.</P>
<P>I. LET us con&s;ider the text as expre&s;&s;ing
the &s;entiment of a di&s;contented man;
with whom it is the effu&s;ion of &s;pleen,
vexation, and di&s;&s;atisfaction with life, a|ri&s;ing
from cau&s;es neither laudable nor
ju&s;tifiable. There are chiefly three cla&s;|&s;es
of men who are liable to this di&s;ea&s;e
of the mind: the idle; the luxurious; the
criminal.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="13">
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THIS wearine&s;s of life is often
found among the idle; per&s;ons common|ly
in ea&s;y circum&s;tances of fortune, who
are not engaged in any of the laborious
occupations of the world, and who are,
at the &s;ame time, without energy of mind
to call them forth into any other line of
active exertion. In this languid, or ra|ther
torpid &s;tate, they have &s;o many va|cant
hours, and are &s;o much at a lo&s;s
how to fill up their time, that their &s;pi|rits
utterly &s;ink; they become burden|&s;ome
to them&s;elves, and to every one a|round
them; and drag with pain the
load of exi&s;tence. What a convincing
proof is hereby afforded, that man was
de&s;igned by his Creator to be an active
being, who&s;e happine&s;s is to be found
not merely in re&s;t, but in occupation
and pur&s;uit? The idle are doomed to
&s;uffer the natural puni&s;hment of their
inactivity and folly; and for their com|plaints
of the tire&s;omen&s;s of life there
is no remedy but to awake from the
dream of &s;loth, and to fill up with pro|per
<PB N="5" REF="14">
employment the mi&s;erable vacancies
of their days. Let them &s;tudy to be|come
u&s;eful to the world, and they &s;hall
&s;oon become le&s;s burden&s;ome to them|&s;elves.
They &s;hall begin to enjoy exi&s;t|ence;
they &s;hall reap the rewards which
Providence has annexed to virtuous ac|tivity;
and have no more cau&s;e to &s;ay,
<HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> THE luxurious and the di&s;&s;ipated
form another cla&s;s of men, among whom
&s;uch complaints are &s;till more frequent.
With them they are not the fruit of idle|ne&s;s.
The&s;e are men who have been
bu&s;ied enough; they have run the whole
race of plea&s;ure; but they have run it
with &s;uch incon&s;iderate &s;peed, that it ter|minates
in wearine&s;s and vexation of &s;pi|rit.
By the perpetual cour&s;e of di&s;&s;ipa|tion
in which they are engaged; by the
exce&s;&s;es which they indulge; by the rio|tous
revel, and the midnight or rather
morning hours to which they prolong
their fe&s;tivity; they have debilitated their
<PB N="6" REF="15">
bodies, and worn out their &s;pirits. Sa|tiated
with the repetition of their ac|cu&s;tomed
plea&s;ures, and yet unable to
find any new ones in their place; wan|dering
round and round their former
haunts of joy, and ever retuning di&s;|appointed;
weary of them&s;elves, and of
all things about them, their &s;pirits are
opre&s;&s;ed with a deadly gloom, and the
complaint bur&s;ts forth of odious life and
a mi&s;erable world. Never are the&s;e com|plaints
more frequent than at the clo&s;e
of rounds of amu&s;ement, and after a long
repetition of fe&s;tal plea&s;ures; when the
&s;pirits which had been forced up, as by
&s;ome intoxicating drug, to an unnatural
height, &s;ub&s;ide into profound dejection.
What increa&s;es the evil is, that it is not
among the infirm and the aged, but a|mong
the young, the gay, and the pro&s;|perous,
who ought to be reputed the hap|pie&s;t
men, that this di&s;ta&s;te of life mo&s;t
frequently prevails.</P>
<P>When per&s;ons of this de&s;cription, in
their peevi&s;h and &s;plenetic hours, exclaim,
<PB N="7" REF="16">
<HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life,</HI> let them
know, let them be a&s;&s;ured, that this is
no other than the judgement of God, o|vertaking
them for their vices and fol|lies.
Their complaints of mi&s;ery are en|titled
to no compa&s;&s;ion; nay, they are
&s;inful, becau&s;e they ari&s;e from a &s;inful
cau&s;e; from a mind broken and deba&s;ed
by luxury and corruption. They are the
authors of their own mi&s;ery, by having
thrown away on the follies of the world
tho&s;e powers which God had be&s;towed
on them for nobler ends.&mdash;Let them re|turn
to the duties of men and Chri&s;tians.
Let them retreat from frivolity, and ab|&s;tain
from ece&s;s. Let them &s;tudy tem|perance,
moderation, and &s;elf-command.
By entering on a virtuous and manly
cour&s;e of action, and applying to the ho|nourable
di&s;charge of the functions of
their &s;tation, they will acquire different
views. They will obtain more real enjoy|ment
of life, and become more willing to
prolong it.&mdash;But, after the warnings
which God has given them of their mi&s;|behaviour
<PB N="8" REF="17">
by the inward mi&s;ery they
&s;uffer, if they &s;till continue to run the
&s;ame intemperate round, and to drain
plea&s;ure to the la&s;t dregs, it &s;hall come
to pa&s;s, that they who now contemn life,
and are impatient of its continuance,
&s;hall be the per&s;ons mo&s;t eager to pro|long
it. When they behold it in reality
drawing towards a clo&s;e, and are obliged
to look forward to what is to come after
it, they &s;hall be rendered awfully &s;en&s;i|ble
of its value. They will then gra&s;p
eagerly at the flying hours; anxious to
&s;top them if they could, and to employ
every moment that remains in repairing
their pa&s;t errors, and in making their
peace, if po&s;&s;ible, with God and heaven.
According as <HI>they have hown,</HI> they now
<HI>reap.</HI> They are reduced <HI>to eat the fruit
of their own ways, and to be filled with
their own devices.</HI></P>
<P>THERE remains &s;till a third cla&s;s of tho&s;e
who from di&s;content are become weary
of life; &s;uch as have embittered it to
<PB N="9" REF="18">
them&s;elves by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of cri|minal
deeds. They have been, perhaps,
unnatural to their parents, or treache|rous
to their friends; they have viola|ted
their fidelity; have en&s;nared and
ruined the innocent; or have occa&s;ioned
the death of others. There is no won|der
that &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould lo&s;e their
reli&s;h for life. To whatever arts they
may have recour&s;e for procuring a de|ceitful
peace, con&s;cience will at times ex|ert
its native power, and &s;hake over them
its terrific &s;courge. The internal mi&s;ery
they endure has &s;ometimes ari&s;en to &s;uch
a height, as has made them terminate,
with their own hands, an exi&s;tence which
they felt to be in&s;upportable.&mdash;To the
complaints of &s;uch per&s;ons no remedy
can be furni&s;hed, except what ari&s;es from
the bitterne&s;s of &s;incere and deep repen|tance.
We can do no more than exhort
for the evils they have committed; and
to fly to the divine mercy through Je&s;us
<PB N="10" REF="19">
Chri&s;t for pardon and forgivene&s;s. Let
us now,</P>
<P>II. TURN to per&s;ons of another de&s;crip|tion,
and con&s;ider the &s;entiment in the
text as extorted by &s;ituations of di&s;tre&s;s.
The&s;e are &s;o various&s;ly multiplied in the
world, and often &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive and heavy,
that a&s;&s;uredly it is not uncommon to hear
the afflicted complain that they are weary
of life. Their complaints, if not always
allowable, yet certainly are more excu&s;able
than tho&s;e which flow from the &s;ources
of di&s;&s;atisfaction already mentioned. They
are &s;ufferers, not &s;o much through their
own mi&s;conduct, as through the appoint|ment
of Providence; and therefore to
per&s;ons in this &s;ituation it may &s;eem more
needful to offer con&s;olation, than to give
admonition. However, as the evils which
produce this impatience of life are of
different &s;orts, a di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made
as to the &s;ituations which can mo&s;t ex|cu&s;e
it.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="20">
SOMETIMES, the exclamation in the
text may be occa&s;ioned by deep and over|whelming
grief. When they whom we
had mo&s;t affectionately loved, and in
whom we had placed the felicity of our
days, are taken away, our connection
with life appears to be di&s;&s;olved. &startq;Why
&s;hould we &s;urvive tho&s;e to whom our
&s;ouls were tied? Would to God we
had died before them! Now when they
are gone, all plea&s;ure and hope is gone
as to us. To us the &s;un no longer &s;hines
with his u&s;ual brightne&s;s. No longer
cheerfuln&s;s inve&s;ts the face of nature.
On every object a &s;ad gloom appears
to re&s;t; and every employment of life
is become an oppre&s;&s;ive burden.&endq; With
the feelings of tho&s;e who are thus di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed
we naturally &s;ympathi&s;e. They
are frequently the feelings of the mo&s;t
virtuous and amiable minds: And yet
&s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t be told, that grief may
be indulged &s;o far as to become immo|derate
and improper. There are bounds
which are pre&s;cribbed to it both by rea&s;on
<PB N="12" REF="21">
and by religion. A Chri&s;tian ought not
to <HI>mourn like tho&s;e who have no hope.</HI>
While he feels his &s;orrows as a man, he
&s;hould al&s;o &s;tudy to bear them like a
man, with fortitude; and not abandon
him&s;elf to feeble and fruitle&s;s melancho|ly.
Let him have recor&s;e to a &s;tre|nuous
di&s;charge of the duties of his &s;ta|tion,
and con&s;ider it as incumbent on
him to make the be&s;t improvement that
he can of tho&s;e comforts which Provi|dence
has &s;till left in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AGAIN; if &s;ometimes happens that, a|part
from grief, great rever&s;es of world|ly
fortune give ri&s;e to the lamentation
in the text. This was the ca&s;e with Job
him&s;elf. A &s;udden fall from opulence
into indigence and want; &s;ome under&s;er|ved
di&s;grace incurred, or &s;ome unexpect|ed
cloud thrown over former reputation
and fame; the unkindne&s;s and de&s;ertion
of friends, or the in&s;olent triumph of e|nemies,
are apt to overwhelm the minds
of men with gloom, and to reduce them
<PB N="13" REF="22">
to be weary of life. To per&s;ons under
&s;uch calamities, &s;ympathy is due. That
&s;ympathy, however, will be proportion|ed
to the degree in which we con&s;ider
them as free from blame in the misfor|tunes
which they &s;uffer. As far as,
through their own mi&s;conduct and vice,
they have been the authors to them&s;elves
of tho&s;e misfortunes, we withdraw our
pity. The burthen which they have
brought on them&s;elves we leave them
to bear us they can; and with little con|cern
we hear them exclaim that their
<HI>&s;ouls are weary of life.</HI>&mdash;Not only &s;o, but
even in ca&s;es where calamities have fallen
on the innocent, to the pity which we
feel for them will be joined a &s;ecret con|tempt,
if we perceive that together with
their pro&s;perity, their courage and for|titude
have al&s;o for&s;aken them. To a|bandon
them&s;elves to dejection carries
no mark of a great or a worthy mind.
In&s;tead of declaring that his <HI>&s;oul is weary
of his life,</HI> it becomes a brave and a good
man, in the evil day, with firmne&s;s to
<PB N="14" REF="23">
maintain his po&s;t; to bear up again&s;t the
&s;torm; to have recour&s;e to tho&s;e advan|tages
which, in the wor&s;t of times, are
always left to integrity and virtue; and
never to give up the hope that better
days may yet ari&s;e.</P>
<P>It is good for per&s;ons in &s;uch &s;ituations
to remark that, though Job was for a
long while &s;everely tried by a variety of
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, yet his condition was not left
finally unhappy. On the contrary, the
goone&s;s of that God whom he had &s;erv|ed
returned at la&s;t, to &s;hine upon him
with greater brighten&s;s than ever. His
riches were re&s;tored to him twofold. The
lo&s;&s;es in his family were repaired by a
new offspring. His name became again
renowned in the Ea&s;t; and <HI>the latter
end of Job,</HI> we are told, <HI>was more ble&s;|&s;ed
than the beginning.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;till, it may be a&s;ked, will not
the continuance of long and &s;evere di&s;|ea&s;e
ju&s;tify the exclamation in the text,
<HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life?</HI> To per&s;ons
<PB N="15" REF="24">
who are for&s;aken by all the ble&s;&s;ings of
health, and who have no pro&s;pect left,
but that of lingering under &s;ickne&s;s or
pain, Job's complaint may a&s;&s;uredly be
forgiven more than to any others. Though
it might be &s;ugge&s;ted to them, that even
in old age and &s;ickne&s;s, except in very
extreme ca&s;es, &s;ome re&s;ources are always
left, of which they may avail them&s;elves
for relief; yet it mu&s;t be admitted, that
lawfully they may wi&s;h their &s;ufferings
to be brought to an end. Still, however,
they mu&s;t remember, that re&s;ignation to
the plea&s;ure of heaven continues to be
their duty to the la&s;t. As long as any
part remains to be acted, as long as their
continuance in the world can &s;erve any
valuable purpo&s;e, it is more honourable
to bear the load with magnanimity, than
to give way to a querulous and dejected
&s;pirit. It remains,</P>

of men, among whom, though more
rarely than among tho&s;e whom I have
<PB N="16" REF="25">
de&s;cribbed, the &s;entiment of the text is to
be found. They are per&s;ons who have
no particular complaint to make of the
inju&s;tice of the world, or the afflictions
of their &s;tate. But they are tired of the
vanity of the world, of its in&s;ipid enjoy|ments,
and its perpetually revolving cir|cle
of tri&s;les and follies. They feel
them&s;elves made for &s;omething greater
and nobler. They are di&s;gu&s;ted and hurt
with the &s;cenes of wickedne&s;s that are
often pa&s;&s;ing before their eyes. Their
hearts are warmed with the thoughts of
a purer and more perfect exi&s;tence de|&s;igned
for man; and in the moments of
a&s;piration after it, the exclamation breaks
forth. <HI>My &s;oul is weary of my life.&mdash;O that
I had wings like a dove! for then I would
fly away and be at re$t. Lo then I would
wander far off, and remain in the wilder|ne&s;s.
I would ha&s;ten my e&s;cape from the
windy &s;torm and tempe&s;t. For I have &s;een
violence and &s;trife in the city. Wickedne&s;s
is in the nud&s;t thereof; deceit and guile de|part

the &s;entiment in the text may &s;ometimes
be that of a devout man. But &s;uch per|&s;ons
I mu&s;t admoni&s;h, that their devo|tion,
how &s;incere however, is not alto|gether
of a rational and cha&s;tened kind.
It was form this temper that, in former
ages of the church, the numerous race
&s;prung of anchorets, hermits, and all the
various orders who voluntarily abandon|ed
the world, to people the lonely di&s;arts
and the mona&s;tic retreat. The ordinary
cour&s;e of things &s;eemed below them as
candidates for heaven. The concerns of
the world appeared unworthy of their
attention, and dangerous to their virtue.
Breathing after a higher &s;tate, they ima|gined
that they could not ab&s;tract them|&s;elves
too much from every earthly a|mu&s;ement,
as long as they were forced
to remain in this place of exile.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="27">
Let us beware of all &s;uch imaginary
refinements as produce a total di&s;reli&s;h
of our pre&s;ent condition. They are, for
the mo&s;t part, grafted either on di&s;ap|pointed
pur&s;uits, or on a melancholy and
&s;plenetic ca&s;t of mind. They are far
from contributing to happine&s;s, and are
incon&s;i&s;tent with all the active virtues of
man. This life de&s;erves not indeed to
be put in competition with that ble&s;&s;ed
immortality to which God has rai&s;ed our
hopes. But &s;uch as it is, it is the gift
of God. It is the &s;phere in which his
wi&s;dom has placed us, and appointed us
to act our parts. As long as it la&s;ts, we
mu&s;t neither &s;light the duties which it
requires, nor undervalue the innocent
enjoyments which it offers. It belongs
to a man to live among men as his bre|thren;
which he who declares him&s;elf
weary of life is not qualified to do with
propriety.</P>
<P>THUS I have placed before you, in
various views, the &s;entiment in the text;
<PB N="19" REF="28">
and have &s;hewn in what circum&s;tances,
and from what cau&s;es, that di&s;reli&s;h of
life ari&s;es which is often found among
mankind. On a review of the whole,
we cannot but acknowledge, that it is
oftener to be a&s;cribed to our own vices
and follies, than to any other cau&s;e. A|mong
the multitudes in the world, to
whom at this day life is burden&s;ome, the
far greater number is of tho&s;e who have
rendered it &s;o to them&s;elves. Their idle|ne&s;s,
their luxury and plea&s;ures, their
criminal deeds, their immoderate pa&s;&s;ions,
their timidity and ba&s;ene&s;s of mind, have
dejected them in &s;uch a degree, as to
make them weary of their exi&s;tence.
Preyed upon by di&s;content of their own
creating, they complain of life when they
ought to reprehend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Various a&s;llictions there doubtle&s;s are
in the world; many per&s;ons with whom
we have cau&s;e to &s;ympathi&s;e, and whom
we might rea&s;onably forgive for wi&s;h|ing
death to clo&s;e their &s;orrows. But of
the evils which embitter life, it mu&s;t be
<PB N="20" REF="29">
admitted, that the greater part is &s;uch as
we have brought on our&s;elves; or at lea&s;t
&s;uch as, if we were not wanting to our|&s;elves,
might be tolerably &s;upported.
When we compute the numbers of tho&s;e
who are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>My &s;oul is weary
of my life,</HI> &s;ome there are to whom this
&s;entiment is excu&s;able; but many more
among whom it is in no way ju&s;tifiable.
I admit that, among the worthie&s;t and
the be&s;t, there may be dark moments
in which &s;ome feeling of this nature may
be apt to intrude upon their minds. But
with them they are only moments of
occa&s;ional and pa&s;&s;ing gloom. They &s;oon
recall the vigour of their minds; and re|turn
with &s;atisfaction to the di&s;charge
of the duties, and to a participation of
the enjoyments, of life.</P>
<P>One great cau&s;e of men's becoming
weary of life is grounded on the mi&s;ta|ken
views of it which they have formed,
and the fal&s;e hopes which they have en|tertained
from it. They have expected a
&s;cene of enjoyment; and when they meet
<PB N="21" REF="30">
with di&s;appointments and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, they
complain of life, as if it had cheated and
betrayed them. God ordained no &s;uch
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for man on earth as continued
plea&s;ure. For the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es he de|&s;igned
our &s;tate to be checquered with
plea&s;ure and pain. As &s;uch let us receive
it, and make the be&s;t of what is doomed
to be our lot. Let us remain per&s;uaded,
that &s;imple and moderate plea&s;ures are
always the be&s;t; that virtue and a good
con&s;cience are the &s;ure&s;t foundations of
enjoyment; that he who &s;erves his God
and his Saviour with the pure&s;t inten|tions,
and governs his pa&s;&s;ions with the
greate&s;t care, is likely to lead the happie&s;t
life. Following the&s;e principles, we &s;hall
meet with fewer occa&s;ions of being wea|ry
of life; we &s;hall always find &s;ome &s;a|tisfactions
mixed with its cor&s;&s;es; and
&s;hall be enabled to wait with a humble
and contented mind till the Almighty,
in his appointed time, fini&s;h our &s;tate of

<HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> and <HI>faith unfeigned.</HI> In
treating of the&s;e, I &s;hall &s;hew the nature
of their connexion with charity, and the
importance of their being always united
with it.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="33">
<HI>The end of the commandment is charity.</HI>
Charity is the &s;ame with benevolence or
love; and is the term uniformly em|ployed,
in the New Te&s;tament, to denote
all the good affections which we ought
to bear towards one another. It con&s;i&s;ts
not in &s;peculative ideas of general bene|volence
floating in the head, and leaving
the heart, as &s;peculations too often do,
untouched and cold. Neither is it con|fined
to that indolent good nature, which
makes us re&s;t &s;atisfied with being free
from inveterate malice, or ill-will to our
fellow-creatures, without prompting us
to be of &s;ervice to any. True charity
is an active principle. It is not proper|ly
a &s;ingle virtue; but a di&s;po&s;ition re|&s;iding
in the heart, as a fountain whence
all the virtues of benignity, candour, for|bearance,
genero&s;ity, compa&s;&s;ion, and li|berality,
flow, as &s;o many native &s;treams.
From general good-will to all, it extends
its influence particularly to tho&s;e with
whom we &s;tand in neare&s;t connection,
and who are directly within the &s;phere
<PB N="25" REF="34">
of our good offices. From the country
or community to which we belong, it
de&s;cends to the &s;maller a&s;&s;ociations of
neighbourhood, relations, and friends;
and &s;preads it&s;elf over the whole circle
of &s;ocial and dome&s;tic life. I mean not
that it imports a promi&s;cuous undi&s;tin|gui&s;hing
affection, which gives every
man an equal title to our love. Cha|rity,
if we &s;hould endeavour to carry it
&s;o far, would be rendered an impracti|cable
virtue, and would re&s;olve i&s;elf
into mere words, without affecting the
heart. True charity attempts not to &s;hut
our eyes to the di&s;tinction between good
and bad men; nor to warm our hearts
equally to tho&s;e who befriend and tho&s;e
who injure us. It re&s;erves our e&s;teem
for good men, and our complacency for
our friends. Towards our enemies it
in&s;pires forgivene&s;s and humanity. It
breathes univer&s;al candour, and liberality
of &s;entiment. It forms gentlene&s;s of
temper, and dictates affability of man|ners.
It prompts corre&s;ponding &s;ypa|thies
<PB N="26" REF="35">
with them who rejoice and them
who weep. It teaches us to &s;light and
de&s;pi&s;e no man. Charity is the comfort|er
of the afflicted, the protector of the
oppre&s;&s;ed, the reconciler of differences,
the interce&s;&s;or for offenders. It is faith|fulne&s;s
in the friend, public &s;pirit in the
magi&s;trate, equity and patience in the
judge, moderation in the &s;overeign, and
loyalty in the &s;ubject. In parents it is
care and attention; in children it is re|verence
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. In a word, it
is the &s;oul of &s;ocial life. It is the &s;un
that enlivens and cheers the abodes of
nien. It is <HI>like the dew of Hermon,</HI> &s;ays
the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>and the dew that de&s;cendet$
on the mountains of Zion, where the Lord
commanded the ble&s;&s;ing, even life for ever|more</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxxxiii. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUCH charity, &s;ays the text, is <HI>the end
of the commandment.</HI> This a&s;&s;ertion of the
<PB N="27" REF="36">
Apo&s;tle is undoubtedly con&s;onant to all
that rea&s;on can &s;ugge&s;t on the &s;ubject of
religion. For, on con&s;idering the nature
of the Supreme Being, rea&s;on gives us
much ground to believe, that the chief
de&s;ign of all the commandments which
he has given to men, is to promote their
happine&s;s. Independent and &s;elf-&s;ufficient,
that Supreme Being has nothing to exact
from us for his own intere&s;t or felicity.
By our &s;ervices he cannot be benefited,
nor by our offences injured. When he
created the world, it was benevolence that
moved him to confer exi&s;tence. When
he made him&s;elf known to his creatures,
benevolence in like manner moved him
to give them laws for their conduct.
Benevolence is the &s;pring of legi&s;lation
in the Deity, as much as it was the mo|tive
of creation. He i&s;&s;ued his com|mands
on earth on purpo&s;e that by o|bedience
to them, his creatures might be
rendered happy among them&s;elves in this
life, and be prepared for greater happine&s;s
in another. Charity, e&s;pecially when
<PB N="28" REF="37">
joined with purity, good con&s;cience, and
faith, is obviou&s;ly the great in&s;trument
for this purpo&s;e; and therefore mu&s;t needs
po&s;&s;e&s;s the chief and primary place in the
laws of God.</P>
<P>Accordingly, throughout the New Te&s;|tament,
it is uniformly pre&s;ented to us
in the &s;ame light in which it is placed by
the text. This is known to all who have
any acquaintance with the &s;acred books.
Charity is termed <HI>the fulfilling of the law,</HI>
and <HI>the bond of perfectne&s;s.</HI> It was a&s;&s;um|ed
by our ble&s;&s;ed Lord as the characte|ri&s;tical
di&s;tinction of his di&s;ciples; and
in that magnificent eulogium which the
Apo&s;tle Paul pronounces upon it, in the
thirteenth chapter of the fir&s;t epi&s;tle to the
Corinthians, it is expre&s;sly preferred by
him to <HI>faith</HI> and <HI>hope.</HI> This de&s;erves to
be &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;idered by tho&s;e who are
apt to undervalue charity, as an appen|dage
of what they contemptuou&s;ly call
Morality; while they confine true reli|gion
to &s;ome favourite tenets and ob&s;er|vances
of their own, which they con&s;i|der
<PB N="29" REF="38">
as comprehending the &s;um of what
is acceptable to God. Such per&s;ons &s;how
them&s;elves profoundly ignorant of the
nature of religion, and may too often be
&s;u&s;pected of being &s;trangers to its influ|ence.
For, as the apo&s;tle John rea&s;ons,
He <HI>that loveth not his brother, whom he
hath &s;een, how can be love that God whom
he hath not &s;een</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">John iv. 2$.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, while I a&s;cribe to
charity that high place in the &s;y&s;tem of re|ligion,
which ju&s;tly belongs to it, I am not
to be under&s;tood as confining all religion
to this di&s;po&s;ition alone. With much
wi&s;dom and propriety, the text hath an|nexed
to it certain adjuncts, without
which neither the character of a good
man can be completed, nor charity it|&s;elf
exerci&s;ed to advantage. To the con|&s;ideration
of the&s;e I now proceed; and
I enter the more readily on this branch
<PB N="30" REF="39">
of the &s;ubject, as there is ground to be|lieve,
that many pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s cha|rity,
without properly under&s;tanding its
nature and efficacy. There has been al|ways
an unhappy tendency among men
to run to extremes, on one &s;ide or other,
in matters of religion. As one &s;et of
men, who employ all their zeal on right
belief, are prone to undervalue good prac|tice;
&s;o another &s;et, who wi&s;h to be e|&s;teemed
rational Chri&s;tians, are inclined
to re&s;t the whole of their duty on chari|table
deeds, while they overlook cer|tain
di&s;po&s;itions and habits which ought
always to accompany them. It is there|fore
of importance, that the mi&s;takes of
both the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men &s;hould be recti|&s;ied,
in order that religion may be held
forth to the world in its complete form,
and in its &s;ull and undimin&s;hed lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t qualification of charity point|ed
out in the text is purity; <HI>charity out
of a pure heart.</HI> Purity includes the vir|tues
which belong to the individual,
<PB N="31" REF="40">
con&s;idered in him&s;elf, and with re&s;pect
to the government of his de&s;ires and
plea&s;ures. It hath its &s;eat in the heart;
but extends its influence over &s;o much
of the outward conduct, as to form a
great and material part of the character.
They are only the <HI>pure in heart,</HI> we are
told by our Saviour, <HI>who can &s;ee God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 8.</NOTE>.
It is al&s;o true, that they are only the <HI>pure
in heart</HI> who can properly di&s;charge their
duties towards mankind. Inordinate love
of plea&s;ure, intemperance, &s;en&s;uality, and
a cour&s;e of irregular life, are incon&s;i&s;tent,
not only with the general character of a
good man, but al&s;o with the peculiar
exerci&s;es of charity and benevolence. For
nothing is more certain, than that habits
of licentious indulgence contribute to
&s;tiffle all the good affections; to harden
the heart; to nouri&s;h that &s;elfi&s;h attach|ment
to our own vitious plea&s;ures which
renders us in&s;en&s;ible to the circum&s;tan|ces
<PB N="32" REF="41">
and wants of others. A profligate
man is &s;eldom found to be a good hu&s;|band,
a good father, or a beneficent
neighbour. How many young per&s;ons
have at fir&s;t &s;et out in the world with
excellent di&s;po&s;itions of heart; generous,
charitable, and humane; kind to their
friends, and amiable among all with
whom they had intercour&s;e? And yet
how often have we &s;een all tho&s;e fair
appearances unhappily bla&s;ted in the pro|gre&s;s
of life, merely through the influ|ence
of loo&s;e and corrupting plea&s;ures;
and tho&s;e very per&s;ons who promi&s;ed
once to be ble&s;&s;ings to the world, &s;unk
down, in the end, to be the burthen and
nui&s;ance of &s;ociety? The profu&s;ion of
expence which their plea&s;ures occa&s;ion,
accounts in a great mea&s;ure for the fatal
rever&s;e that takes place in their charac|ter.
It not only drains the &s;ources
whence the &s;treams of beneficence &s;hould
flow, but often obliges them to become
oppre&s;&s;ive and cruel to tho&s;e whom it was
<PB N="33" REF="42">
their duty to have patroni&s;ed and &s;up|ported.</P>
<P>Purity of heart and conduct mu&s;t there|fore
be held fundamental to charity and
love, as well as to general piety and vir|tue.
The licentious, I know, are ready
to imagine, that their occa&s;ional deeds
of bounty and liberality will atone for
many of their private di&s;orders. But,
be&s;ides that &s;uch plans of compen&s;ation
for vices, by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed virtues, are
always fallacious, the licentious may be
a&s;&s;ured, that it is an appearance only of
charity, not the reality of it, to which
they can lay claim. For that great vir|tue
con&s;i&s;ts not in occa&s;ional actions of
humanity, in fits of kindne&s;s or compa&s;|ion,
to which bad men may be prompted
by natural in&s;tinct; but in the &s;teady and
regular exerci&s;e of tho&s;e good affections,
and the di&s;charge of tho&s;e important du|ties
towards others, for which the licen|tious
are in a great mea&s;ure di&s;qualified.
Their criminal propen&s;ities direct their
inclinations to very different objects and
<PB N="34" REF="43">
pur&s;uits; and often determine them to
&s;acrifice the ju&s;t rights of others, &s;ome|times
to &s;acrifice the peace and the re|putation
of the innocent, to the gratifi|cation
of their pa&s;&s;ions. Such is the per|nicious
influence which the love of plea|&s;ure
has on the good qualities of its de|voted
votaries. The impure heart is like
the &s;tagnant and putrifying lake, which
&s;ends forth its poi&s;onous exhalations to
corrupt and wither every plant that grows
on its banks.</P>
<P>THE &s;econd qualification annexed to
Charity, in the text, is, that it be <HI>of a
good con&s;cience.</HI> By this I under&s;tand the
Apo&s;tle to mean, that charity be in full
con&s;i&s;tency with ju&s;tice and integrity;
that the <HI>con&s;cience</HI> of the man who pur|po&s;es
to perform actions of benevolence,
be free from the reproach of having ne|glected
the primary duties of equity.
For, undoubtedly, ju&s;tice is a virtue pri|mary
to charity; that is, it mu&s;t go be|fore
it in all its exertions. One mu&s;t fir&s;t
<PB N="35" REF="44">
<HI>do ju&s;tly</HI> before he can pretend that he
<HI>loves mercy.</HI>&mdash;Religion, my friends, in or|der
to render it u&s;eful to mankind, mu&s;t
be brought down by its teachers from the
&s;ublimity of &s;peculation to the functions
and occupations of ordinary life. It is
my duty to admoni&s;h you, that you mu&s;t,
in the fir&s;t place, be fair in all your deal|ings
with others; you mu&s;t di&s;charge the
debts you owe; you mu&s;t pay the wages
due to your &s;ervants and dependents;
you mu&s;t provide for your own family,
and be ju&s;t to the claims of relations;
then, and then only, you can, <HI>from a good
con&s;cience,</HI> as the text enjoins, perform
acts of genero&s;ity and mercy.</P>
<P>This leads to a reflection which here
de&s;erves our attention; that, in order to
fulfil that <HI>charity which is the end of the
commandment,</HI> oeconomy, and good order
in private life, ought to be carefully &s;tu|died
by all Chri&s;tians. This is more
clo&s;ely connected with <HI>a good con&s;cience,</HI>
than many &s;eem inclined to admit. Oe|conomy,
when prudently and temperate|ly
<PB N="36" REF="45">
conducted, is the &s;afeguard of many
virtues; and is in a particular manner
favourable to the exertions of benevo|lence.
He who by incon&s;iderate con|duct
is injuring his circum&s;tances, will
probably in time lo&s;e the inclination, and
certainly is depriving him&s;elf of the means,
of being &s;erviceable to his brethren. Some
important exertions, indeed, there are
of charity, which have no connection
with giving or be&s;towing. Candour, for|givene&s;s,
gentlene&s;s, and &s;ympathy, are
due to our brethren at all times, and in
every &s;ituation of our own fortune. The
poor have opportunities for di&s;playing
the&s;e virtues, as well as the rich. They
who have nothing to give, can often afford
relief to others, by imparting what they
feel. But, as far as beneficence is in|cluded
in charity, we ought always to
remember, that ju&s;tice mu&s;t, in the fir&s;t
place, be held inviolably &s;acred.</P>
<P>The wi&s;dom of &s;cripture remarkably
appears, in the connexion pointed out
by the text between <HI>charity</HI> and <HI>good con&s;|cience</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="46">
or integrity; a connexion which I
apprehend is often not attended to &s;o much
as it de&s;erves. Among the frugal and in|du&s;trious,
great regard is commonly paid
to ju&s;tice. They will not defraud. They
will not take any unlawful advantage
in their dealings: And &s;atisfied with this
degree of <HI>good con&s;cience,</HI> they are &s;tran|gers
to that charity, which is the <HI>end
of the commandment.</HI> They are hard and
unfeeling. They are rigid and &s;evere in
their demands. They know nothing of
humanity, forgivene&s;s, or compa&s;&s;ion.&mdash;Among
another cla&s;s of men, who have
been more liberally educated, and who
are generally of a higher rank in life, ju&s;|tice
is apt to be con&s;idered as a virtue le&s;s
noble than charity; and which may, on
&s;ome occa&s;ions be di&s;pen&s;ed with. They
are humane perhaps, and tender in their
feelings. They are ea&s;y to their depend|ents.
They can be liberal, even to profu|&s;ion.
While, at the &s;ame time, they are
accumulating debts, which they know
them&s;elves unable to di&s;charge. Their
<PB N="38" REF="47">
affairs are allowed to run into confu&s;ion.
Oeconomy and good order are neglected.
The innocent, in great numbers, &s;uffer
materially through their mi&s;management:
And all the while they a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves
the prai&s;e of being generous and
good-hearted men. This &s;urely is not that
<HI>charity</HI> which the Go&s;pel enjoins; and
which, in its very e&s;&s;ence, involves; <HI>good
con&s;cience</HI> and integrity. He who pre|tends
to do good to his brethren, without
fir&s;t doing them ju&s;tice, cannot be acount|ed
their real friend. True charity is not
a meteor, which occa&s;ionally glares; but a
luminary, which, in its orderly and re|gular
cour&s;e, di&s;pen&s;es a benignant influ|ence.</P>
<P>THE third and la&s;t adjunct connected in
the text with charity is, that it be <HI>of faith
unfeigned.</HI> Faith, in the &s;cripture &s;en&s;e of
it, includes the whole of religious princi|ples
re&s;pecting God, and re&s;pecting Chri&s;t.
Good principles, without good practice, I
confe&s;s, are nothing; they are of no avail
<PB N="39" REF="48">
in the &s;ight of God, nor in the e&s;timation
of wi&s;e men. But practice not founded
on principle is likely to be always un&s;ta|ble
and wavering; and, therefore, the
faith of religious principles enters, for a
very con&s;iderable &s;hare, into the proper
di&s;charge of the duties of charity.</P>
<P>It will be admitted that, without faith,
our duties towards God cannot be pro|perly
performed. You may be a&s;&s;ured
that your duties towards men will al|ways
greatly &s;uffer from the want of it.
Faith, where pure and genuine, &s;upplies
to every part of virtue, and in particular
of the virtue of charity, many motives
and a&s;&s;i&s;tances, of which the unbelie|ver
is de&s;titute. He who acts from
faith acts upon the high principle of re|gard
to the God who hath made him,
and to the Saviour who redeems him;
which will often &s;timulate him to his
duty when other principles of benevo|lence
become faint and languid, or are
cro&s;&s;ed by oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts. When he
con&s;iders him&s;elf as pur&s;uing the appro|bation
<PB N="40" REF="49">
of that divine Being from whom
love de&s;cends, a &s;acred enthu&s;ia&s;m both
prompts, and con&s;ecrates, his charitable
di&s;po&s;itions. Regardle&s;s of men, or of
human recompence, he is carried along
by a higher impul&s;e. He acts with the
&s;pirit of a follower of the Son of God,
who not only has enjoined love, but has
enforced it by the example of laying
down his life for mankind. Whatever
he does in behalf of his fellow-creatures,
he con&s;iders him&s;elf as doing, in &s;ome de|gree,
to that diving Per&s;on, who hath
&s;aid, <HI>Ina&s;much as ye have done it unto one
of the lea&s;t of the&s;e my brethren, ye have
done it unto me</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xxv. 40.</NOTE>. Hence charity is with
him not only a moral virtue, but a Chri&s;|tian
grace. It acquires additional dignity
and energy from being connected with
the heavenly &s;tate and the heavenly in|habitants.
He mingles with beings of a
higher order, while he is di&s;charging his
<PB N="41" REF="50">
duty to his fellow-creatures on earth; and
by joining faith and piety to good works,
he completes the character of a Chri&s;|tian.</P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to explain
the full &s;en&s;e of that comprehen&s;ive view
of religion, which is given in the text.
I have &s;hown in what re&s;pects <HI>charity</HI>
joined with <HI>the pure heart, the good con|&s;cience,</HI>
and <HI>faith unfeigned,</HI> forms <HI>the end
of the commandment.</HI> Let us ever keep
in view tho&s;e e&s;&s;entail parts of a virtuous
character, and pre&s;erve them in their
proper union. Thus &s;hall our religion
ri&s;e into a regular and well-proportioned
edifice, where each part gives firmne&s;s
and &s;upport to another. If any one of
tho&s;e material parts be wanting in the
&s;tructure; if, out of our &s;y&s;tem of cha|rity,
either purity, or ju&s;tice, or faith,
be left, there will be cracks an flaws
in the building which prepare its ruin.</P>
<P>This is indeed one of the greate&s;t and
mo&s;t frequent errors of men, in their
<PB N="42" REF="51">
moral conduct. They take hold of vir|tue
by pieces and corners only. Few
are odepraved as to be without all &s;en&s;e
of duty, and all regard to it. To &s;ome
moral qualities, which appear to them
amiable or e&s;timable, almo&s;t all men lay
claim; and on the&s;e they re&s;t their worth,
in their own e&s;timation. But the&s;e &s;cat|tered
pieces of virtue, not uniting into
one whole, nor forming a con&s;i&s;tent cha|racter,
have no powerful influence on
their general habits of live. From various
unguarded quarters they lie open to
temptation. Their lives are full of con|tradiction,
and perpetually fluctuate be|tween
good and evil. Virtue can nei|ther
ri&s;e to its native dignity, nor attain
its proper rewards, until all its chief parts
be joined together in our character, and
exert an equal authority in regulating our
conduct.</P>

the food that we receive, the re&s;t
that we enjoy, daily admoni&s;h us of a
&s;uperior power, on whom the inhabitants
of the earth depend for light, life, and
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But as long as all things
<PB N="44" REF="53">
proceed in their ordinary cour&s;e; when
day returns after day with perfect &s;imi|larity;
when our life &s;eems &s;tationary,
and nothing occurs to warn us of any ap|proaching
change, the religious &s;enti|ments
of dependence are apt to be for|gotten.
The great revolutions of time,
when they come round in their &s;tated
order, have a tendency to force &s;ome im|pre&s;&s;ions
of piety even on the mo&s;t un|thinking
minds. They both mark our
exi&s;tence on earth to be advancing to|wards
its clo&s;e, and exhibit our condition
as continually changing; while each re|turning
year brings along with it new e|vents,
and at the &s;ame time carries us
forwards to the conclu&s;ion of all. We
cannot, on &s;uch occa&s;ions avoid perceiv|ing,
that there is a Supreme Being who
holds in his hands the line of our exi&s;tence,
and measures out to each of us our allot|ted
portion of that line. Beyond a certain
limit, we know that it cannot be extend|ed;
and long before it reach that limit it
may be cut a&s;under by an invi&s;ible hand,
<PB N="45" REF="54">
which is &s;tretched forth over all the inha|bitants
of the world. Then naturally a|ri&s;es
the ejaculation of the text, <HI>My times,
O God, are in thy hand.</HI> &startq;My fate de|pends
on thee. The duration of my
life, and all the events which in fu|ture
days are to fill it, are entirely at
thy di&s;po&s;al.&endq;&mdash;Let us now, when we
have ju&s;t &s;een one year clo&s;e, and another
begin, meditate &s;eriou&s;ly on this &s;enti|ment.
Let us con&s;ider what is implied
in <HI>our times being in the hand of God;</HI> and
to what improvement this meditation
leads.</P>
<P>THE text evidently implies, fir&s;t, that
<HI>our times</HI> are not in our own hand; that,
as our continuance in life depends not
on our&s;elves, &s;o the events which are
to happen, while life remains, are un|known
to us, and not under our own
direction. Of this we may behold ma|ny
a proof, when we look back on the tran&s;actions
of the year which is ju&s;t fi|ni&s;hed.
Recollection will readily pre&s;ent
<PB N="46" REF="55">
to us a bu&s;y period, filled up with a
mixture of bu&s;ine&s;s and amu&s;ement, of
anxieties and cares, of joys and &s;orrows.
We have talked, perhaps, and acted much.
We have formed many a plan; in pub|lic
or in private life, we have been en|gaged
in a varitey of pur&s;uits. Let me
now a&s;k, how &s;mall a proportion of all
that has happened could have been fore|&s;een,
or foretold by us? How many
things have occurred, of which we had
no expectiation; &s;ome, perhaps, that have
&s;ucceeded beyond our hopes; many,
al&s;o, that have befallen us contrary to
our wi&s;h? How often were each of us ad|moni&s;hed
that there are &s;ecret wheels,
which, un&s;een by us, bring about the
revolutions of human affairs; and that,
while man was devi&s;ing his way, Provi|dence
was directing the event?</P>
<P>That &s;cene is now clo&s;ed. The tale of
that year had been told. We look for|ward
to the year which is beginning;
and what do we behold there?&mdash;All, my
brethren, is a blank to our view: A dark
<PB N="47" REF="56">
unknown pre&s;ents it&s;elf. We are enter|ing
on an untried, undi&s;covered coun|try,
where, as each &s;ucceeding month
comes forward, new &s;cenes may open;
new objects may engage our attention;
changes at home or abroad, in public or
in private affairs, may alter the whole
&s;tate of our fortune. New connections
may be at hand to be formed, or old
ones ju&s;t about to be di&s;&s;olved; perhaps,
we may have little more to do with this
world, or with any of its connections;
we may be &s;tanding on the verge of time
and life, and on the point of pa&s;&s;ing
into a new region of exi&s;tence. In &s;hort,
the pro&s;pect before us is full of awful
uncertainty. Life and death, pro&s;perity
and adver&s;ity, health and &s;ickne&s;s, joy
and trouble, lie in one undi&s;tingui&s;hable
ma&s;s, where our eye can de&s;cry nothing
through the ob&s;curity that wraps them
up.</P>
<P>While it is thus certain that <HI>our times</HI>
are not at our own di&s;po&s;al, we are
taught, by the text, that they are <HI>in the
<PB N="48" REF="57">
hand of God.</HI> This may be con&s;idered
in two views. Our times are in the hand
of God, as a &s;upreme Di&s;po&s;er of events.
They are in the had of God as a Guar|dian
and a Father.</P>
<P><HI>Our times,</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>are in the hand of
God</HI> as a &s;upreme irre&s;i&s;tible Ruler. All
that is to happen to us in this and the
&s;ucceeding years of our life,&mdash;if any &s;uc|ceeding
years we &s;hall be allowed to &s;ee,&mdash;
has been foreknown and arranged by
God. The fir&s;t view, under which hu|man
affairs pre&s;ent them&s;elves to us, is
that of confu&s;ed and irregular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion.
The events of the world &s;eem thrown
together by chance, like the billows of
the &s;ea, tumbling and to&s;&s;ing over each
other, without rule or order. All that
is apparent to us is the fluctuation of hu|man
caprice, and the operation of hu|man
pa&s;&s;ions. We &s;ee the &s;trife of am|bition,
and the efforts of &s;tratagem, la|bouring
to accompli&s;h their &s;everal pur|po&s;es
among the &s;ocieties of men. But
<PB N="49" REF="58">
it is no more than the &s;urface, the out|&s;ide
of things, that we behold. Higher
coun&s;els, than it is in our power to trace,
are concerned in the tran&s;actions of the
world. If we believe in God at all, as
the Governor of the univer&s;e, we mu&s;t
believe that without his providence, no|thing
happens on earth. He over-rules,
at his plea&s;ure, the pa&s;&s;ions of men. He
bends all their de&s;igns into &s;ub&s;erviency
to his decree. <HI>He makes the wrath of man
to prai&s;e him;</HI> and <HI>re&s;trains,</HI> in what mea|&s;ure
he thinks fit, <HI>the reminder of wrath</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. lxxvi. 10.</NOTE>.
He brings forth in their cour&s;e all the
generations of men. When the time is
come for their entering into light, they
appear on the &s;tage; and when the time
fixed for their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion arrives, he <HI>chan|ges
their countenance,</HI> and &s;ends them a|way.
The time of our appearing is now
come, after our ance&s;tors had left their
place, and gone down to the du&s;t. We
<PB N="50" REF="59">
are at pre&s;ent permitted to act our part
freely, and without con&s;traint. No vio|lence
is done to our inclination or choice.
But a&s;&s;uredly there is not a day of our life,
nor an event in that day, but was fore&s;een
by God. That &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of occurrences,
which to us is full of ob&s;curity and dark|ne&s;s,
is all light and order in his view. He
&s;ees from the beginning to the end; and
brings forward every thing that happens,
in its due time and place.</P>
<P><HI>Our times are</HI> altogether <HI>in his hand.</HI>
Let us take notice, that they are not in
the hands either of our enemies, or of our friends. It is not in the power of
man to &s;horten or to prolong our life,
more or le&s;s than God has decreed.
Enemies may employ craft or violence
in their attacks; friends may employ
&s;kill and vigilance for the pre&s;erva|tion
of our health and &s;afety; but
both the one and the other can have
effect only as far as God permits. They
work in &s;ub&s;erviency to his purpo&s;e. By
him they are held in invi&s;ible bonds.
<PB N="51" REF="60">
To the exertions of all human agents
he &s;ays, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come, and no
farther.</HI></P>
<P>WE are to ob&s;erve next, that <HI>our times
are in the hand of God.</HI> not only as an
almighty di&s;po&s;er, but as a merciful
Guardian and Father. We are by no
means to imagine, that from race to race,
and from year to year, God &s;ports with
the lives of &s;ucceeding generations of
men, or, in the mere wantonne&s;s of ar|bitrary
power, brings them forth, and
&s;ends them away. No; if we have any
confidence in what either the light of na|ture
&s;ugge&s;ts to all men, or what the
revelation of the go&s;pel had confirmed to
Chri&s;tians, we have full ground to be|lieve,
that the admini&s;tration of human
affairs is conducted with infinite wi&s;dom
and goodne&s;s. The coun&s;els of the Al|mighty
are indeed too deep for out limit|ed
under&s;tandings to trace. <HI>His path</HI>
may often, as to us, <HI>be in the &s;ea, and his
foot&s;teps in the mighty waters;</HI> while, ne|verthele&s;s,
<PB N="52" REF="61">
<HI>all his paths are mercy and
truth.</HI> He who, from the benignity of
his nature, erected this world for the a|bode
of men; He who furni&s;hed it &s;o
richly for our accommodation, and &s;to|red
it with &s;o much beauty for our en|tertainment;
He who, &s;ince fir&s;t we en|tered
into life, hath followed us with &s;uch
a variety of mercies, &s;urely can have no
plea&s;ure in our di&s;appointment and di&s;tre&s;s.
<HI>He knows our frame; he remem|bers
we are du&s;t;</HI> and looks to frail man,
we are a&s;&s;ured, with <HI>&s;uch pity as a father
beareth to his children</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. ciii. 13, 14.</NOTE>. To him we may
&s;afely commit our&s;elves, and all our con|cerns;
as to one who is be&s;t qualified,
both to direct the incidents proper to
happen to us in this world, and to judge
of the time when it is fit for us to be re|moved
from it.</P>
<P>Even that ignorance of our future d&s;|tiny
in life, of which we &s;ometimes
<PB N="53" REF="62">
complain, is a &s;ignal proof of his good|ne&s;s.
he hides from us the view of &s;e|curity,
becau&s;e the view would be dan|gerous
and overpowering. It would ei|ther
di&s;pirit us with vi&s;ions of terror, or
intoxicate us by the di&s;clo&s;ure of &s;ucce&s;s.
The veil which covers from our &s;ight
the events of this and of &s;ucceeding years,
is a veil woven by the hand of mercy.
Our <HI>times are in his hand;</HI> and we have
rea&s;on to be glad that in his hand they
are kept, hut out from our view. Sub|mit
to his plea&s;ure as an almighty Ruler
we mu&s;t, becau&s;e we cannot re&s;i&s;t him.
Equal rea&s;on there is for tru&s;ting in him
as a Guardian, under who&s;e di&s;po&s;al we
are &s;afe.</P>
<P>SUCH is the import of the text, that
<HI>our times are in the hand of God.</HI> Our
times are unknown to us, and not under
our own direction. They are in the
hands of God as a Governor and Ruler;
in the hands of God as a Guardian and
Father. The&s;e &s;eparate views of the text
<PB N="54" REF="63">
require, on our part, &s;eparate improve|ments.</P>
<P>SEEING our times are not in our own
hand, &s;eeing futurity is unknown to us,
let us, fir&s;t, check the vain curio&s;ity of pe|netrating
into what is to come. Conjec|ture
about futurity we often mu&s;t,; but
upon all conjectures of what this year is
to produce, let us lay a proper re&s;traint.
Let us wait till God &s;hall bring forward
events in their proper cour&s;e, without
wi&s;hing to di&s;cover what he has conceal|ed;
le&s;t, if the di&s;covery were granted,
we &s;hould &s;ee many things, which we
would wi&s;h not to have &s;een.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t common propen&s;ity of man|kind
is to &s;tore futurity with whate|ver
is agreeable to them; e&s;pecially in
tho&s;e periods of life when imagination is
lively, and hope is ardent. Looking for|ward
to the year now beginning, they
are ready to promi&s;e them&s;elves much
from the foundations of pro&s;perity which
they have laid; from the friend&s;hips and
<PB N="55" REF="64">
connections which they have &s;ecured;
from the plans of conduct which they have
formed. Alas! how deceitful do all the&s;e
dreams of happine&s;s often prove! While
many are &s;aying in &s;ecret to their hearts,
<HI>To-morrow &s;hall be as this day and more a|bundantly,</HI>
we are obliged in return to &s;ay
to them, <HI>Boa&s;t not thy&s;elf of to-morrow, for
thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring
forth.</HI> I do not mean, that in the un|known
pro&s;pect which lies before us, we
&s;hould forebode to our&s;elves nothing but
misfortunes.&mdash;May it be the plea&s;ure of
heaven that this year run on in a placid
and tranquil tenor to us all!&mdash;But this
I &s;ay, that in &s;uch fore&s;ight of futurity
as we are allowed to take, we may rec|kon
upon it as certain, that this year
&s;hall prove to us, as many pa&s;t have pro|ved,
a checquered &s;cene of &s;ome com|forts
and &s;ome troubles. In what pro|portion
one or other of the&s;e &s;hall prevail
in it; whether, when it ends, it &s;hall
leave with us the memory of joys or of
&s;orrows, is to be determined by him in
<PB N="56" REF="65">
who&s;e hands <HI>our times are.</HI> Our wi&s;dom
is, to be prepared for whatever the
year is to bring; prepared to receive
comforts with thankfulne&s;s, troubles with
fortitude; and to improve both for the
great purpo&s;es of virtue and eternal life.</P>
<P>ANOTHER important in&s;truction which
naturally ari&s;es from our times not be|ing
in our own hands is, that we ought
no longer to rifle with what it is not in
our power to prolong; but that we &s;hould
make ha&s;te to live as wi&s;e men; not de|laying
till tomorrow what may be done
today' <HI>doing now with all our night
whatever our hand findeth to do;</HI> before
that <HI>might cometh wherein no man can work.</HI></P>
<P>Amid&s;t the uncertainty of the events
which are before us, there is one thing
we have too much rea&s;on to believe
namely, that of us who are now a&s;&s;em|bled
in this congregation, and who have
&s;een the year begin, there are &s;ome who
&s;hall not &s;urvive to &s;ee it clo&s;e. Whe|ther
it &s;hall be you, or you, or I, who
<PB N="57" REF="66">
&s;hall be gathered to our fathers before
the revolving year has fini&s;hed its round,
God alone knows. <HI>Our times are in his
hand?</HI> But to our place, it is more than
probable that &s;ome of us &s;hall have gone.
Could we foretel the month, or the day,
on which our change was to happen,
how diligent would we be in &s;etting our
hou&s;e in order, and preparing our&s;elves
to appear before our Maker? Surely,
that ought to be prepared for with mo&s;t
care, concerning which we are ignorant
how &s;oon it is to take place. Let us
therefore <HI>walk circum&s;pectly, and redeem
the time.</HI> Let us di&s;mi&s;s tho&s;e trivial and
&s;uperfluous cares which burden or cor|rupt
our life, in order to attend to what
is of highe&s;t importance to us as men and
Chri&s;tians. The beginning of each year
&s;hould carry to us all a &s;olemn admoni|tion
of our folly, in neglecting to im|prove
&s;uitably the years that are pa&s;t.
it &s;hould call up mi&s;pent time into our
view; and be like the hand coming forth
upon the wall, in the days of Bel&s;haz|zar,
<PB N="58" REF="67">
and writing in legible characters o|ver

thou art weighed in the balance,
and found wanting; take care le&s;t they
kingdom be on the point of departing
from thee.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider, in the next place,
that our times, as I before illu&s;trated,
are in the hand of God as a &s;overeign
Di&s;po&s;er, it is an obvious inference from
this truth, that we &s;hould prepare our|&s;elves
to &s;ubmit patiently to his plea&s;ure,
both as to the events which are to fill up
our days, and as to the time of our con|tinuing
in this world. To contend with
him we know to be fruitle&s;s. The word
that is gone out of his mouth mu&s;t &s;tand.
In the path which he has marked out
for us, whether it be &s;hort or long, rug|ged
or &s;mooth, we mu&s;t walk. Is it not
then the dictate of wi&s;dom, that we &s;hould
previously reconcile our&s;elves to this &s;o|vereign
ordination, and bring our minds
to harmonize with what is appointed to
be our de&s;tiny? let us fortify this tem|per,
<PB N="59" REF="68">
by recalling that reflexion of the
wi&s;e man; <HI>who knoweth what is food for
man in this life; all the days of his vain

<P>To enjoy long life, and &s;ee many days,
is the univer&s;al wi&s;h; and, as the wi&s;h
is prompted by nature, it cannot be in
it&s;elf unlawful. At the &s;ame time, &s;everal
circum&s;tances concur to temper
the eagerne&s;s of this wi&s;h; and to &s;how
us that it &s;hould always be formed un|der
due &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the wi&s;er judge|ment
of Heave. Who among us can
tell, whether, in wi&s;hing for the conti|nuance
of many years on earth, we may
not be only wi&s;hing for a prolongation
of di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery?&mdash;You might live,
my friends, till you had undergone lin|gering
rounds of &s;ervere pain, from which
death would have proved a &s;ea&s;onable
deliverance. You might live till your
brea&s;ts were pierced with many a wound
from public calamities or private &s;orrows.
<PB N="60" REF="69">
You might live till you beheld the death
of all whom you had loved; till you &s;ur|vived
all tho&s;e who love you; till you
were left as de&s;olate &s;trangers on earth,
in the mid&s;t of a new race, who neither
knew you, nor cared for you, but who
wi&s;hed you, off the &s;tage.&mdash;Of a nature &s;o
ambiguous are all the pro&s;pects which life
&s;ets before us, that in every wi&s;h we form
relating to them,. much rea&s;on we have
to be &s;atisfied that our times are in the
hands of God, rather than our own.</P>
<P>THIS con&s;ideration is greatly &s;trength|ened
when, in the la&s;t place, we think of
God acting, not as a Sovereign only, but
as a Guardian, in the di&s;po&s;al of our
times. This is our great con&s;olation in
looking forward to futurity. To God
as a wi&s;e Ruler, calm &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion is due;
but it is more than &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion that be|longs
to him as a merciful Father; it is
the &s;pirit of cordial and affectionate con&s;ent
to his will. Unknown to us as the times
to come are, it &s;hould be &s;ufficient to our
<PB N="61" REF="70">
full repo&s;e that they are known to God.
The day and the hour which are fixed
in his coun&s;els for our dismi&s;&s;ion from
life, we ought to be per&s;uaded are fixed
for the be&s;t; and that any longer we
&s;hould not wi&s;h to remain.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee that la&s;t hour drawing
nigh, though our &s;pirit may be com|po&s;ed
on our own account, yet, on ac|count
of our friends and families, no
little anxiety and &s;orrow may be &s;ome|times
apt to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the mind.
Long we have enjoyed the comfort of
their &s;ociety, and been accu&s;tomed to con|&s;ider
them as parts of our&s;elves. To be
parted from them forever is, at any rate,
a bitter thought; but to the bitterne&s;s of
this, is over and above added the aprrehen|&s;ion
of their &s;uffering much by our death.
We leave many a relation, perhaps may
leave young children, and a helple&s;s family.
behind us, to be expo&s;ed to various dan|gers,
and thrown forth on an unfriendly

oppre&s;s the tender and feeling heart at

<P>I HAVE thus &s;hown what the import

<PB N="63" REF="72">
of the doctrine of the text, that <HI>our times

the truth of which can be called in que&s;|tion
by none; a fact which, whether
per&s;ons have any &s;entiments of religion
or not, is calculated to make a &s;erious im|pre&s;&s;ion
on every mind; e&s;pecially at &s;ea|&s;ons
when the revolution of years gives
us warning that our duration on earth
is mea&s;ured, and advances towards its

of the text is &s;till more important. A|mong
them it tends to awaken impre&s;|&s;ions
which are not only &s;erious, but, as
I have &s;hown, &s;alutary and comforting
to the heart.&mdash;Thankful that our times
are in the hand of a Sovereign, who is
both wi&s;e and gracious, let us prepare
our&s;elves to meet the approaching events
of life with becoming re&s;ignation, and

our duty; and when it &s;hall plae&s;e him
to give the command for our removal
hence, let us utter only this voice: &startq;In
thy hand, O my God, <HI>my times are.</HI>
Thou art calling me away. Here I

<P>THE parable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. IV.</NOTE> of which the&s;e words
are a part, contains a prophetical
de&s;cription of the &s;tate of the church.
Our Lord predicts that the &s;ocieties of
Chri&s;tians were to be infected with per|&s;ons
of loo&s;e principles and bad di&s;po&s;i|tions,
whom he likens to <HI>tares</HI>&s;pringing
up among <HI>wheat.</HI> He intimates that
there &s;hould ari&s;e &s;ome who&s;e officious
<PB N="67" REF="76">
zeal would prompt the de&s;ire of extermi|nating
immediately all &s;uch evil men;
but that this were contrary to the de|&s;igns
of providence, and to the &s;pirit of
Chri&s;tianity; that a complete &s;eparation
was indeed to be made at la&s;t between
the good and the bad; but that this &s;e|paration
was to be delayed till the end
of the world, when, in the &s;tile of the
parable, the <HI>tares</HI>&s;hould be entirely <HI>ga|thered
out from among the wheat. Let
both grow together until the harve&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>When we look around us nothing is
more con&s;picuous in the &s;tate of the
world, than that broad mixture of the
religious and the impious, the virtuous
and the wicked, which we find taking
place in every &s;ociety. Strong objec|tions
&s;eem hence to ari&s;e again&s;t either
the wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s of divine pro|vidence;
e&s;pecially when we behold bad
men not only tolerated in the world, but
occa&s;ionally exalted in their circum&s;tan|ces,
to the depre&s;&s;ion of the ju&s;t. Why,
it will be &s;aid, if a Supreme Being exi&s;t,
<PB N="68" REF="77">
and if his ju&s;tice rule the univer&s;e, does
he allow &s;uch infamous per&s;ons as the
records of hi&s;tory often pre&s;ent, to have
a place, and even to make a figure in
his world? why &s;leeps the thunder idle
in his hand, when it could &s;o ea&s;ily bla&s;t
them? What &s;hall we think of one who,
having the power of exterminating them
always at his command, permits them
to proceed without di&s;turbance; nay,
&s;ometimes appears to look on them with
complacency?&mdash;It becomes highly wor|thy
of out attention to con&s;ider what an|&s;wer
can be made to the&s;e objections
to inquire whether any rea&s;ons can be
given that &s;erve to ju&s;tify this di&s;pen&s;a|tion
of Providence, in allowing a mix|ture
of bad men to continue on the face
of the earth until the end of time. This
inquiry &s;hall make the &s;ubject of the
pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e, together with &s;uch re|flections
as naturally ari&s;e from &s;urvey|ing
the &s;tate of human affairs.</P>
<P>BUT, before entering directly on &s;uch
<PB N="69" REF="78">
inquiry, it may be proper to take no|tice,
that, in our e&s;timation of who are
the good, who are the bad, we are often
in hazard of committing mi&s;takes. The
real characters of men are known only
to God. They frequently depend on the
&s;ecret and un&s;een parts of life. As in
judging of them&s;elves men are always
partial, &s;o in judging of others they of|ten
err, through the imperfect informa|tion
which they have gathered, or the
ra&s;h prejudices which they have formed.
They are too apt to limit the character
of virtue to tho&s;e who agree with them
in &s;entiment and belief; and to exagge|rate
the failings of tho&s;e again&s;t whom they
have conceived di&s;like, into great and
unpardonable crimes. Were it left to
the indi&s;creet zeal of &s;ome to extirpate
from the earth all tho&s;e whom they con|&s;ider
as bad men, there is ground to ap|prehend
that, in&s;tead of tares the wheat
would often be rooted out.&mdash;At the &s;ame
time, we readily admit the fact, as too
manife&s;t to be denied, that a multitude
<PB N="70" REF="79">
of gro&s;s and notorious &s;inners are now
mixed with the followers of God and
virtue. Let us proceed then to con&s;ider
how far this is con&s;i&s;tent with the ju&s;|tice
and wi&s;dom of the Governor of the
world.</P>
<P>IT is a principle in which all &s;erious
and reflecting per&s;ons have agreed, and
which by many arguments is confirmed,
that our pre&s;ent &s;tate on earth is de&s;igned
to be a &s;tate of di&s;cipline and improvement,
in order to fit human nature for a higher
and better &s;tate which it is to attain here|after.
Now, this principle being once
admitted, we &s;ay, that the mixture of vir|tue
and vice which here prevails, is cal|culated
to an&s;wer this purpo&s;e better
than a more unmixed and perfect &s;tate
of &s;ociety would have done.</P>
<P>FOR, in the fir&s;t plcae, the crimes of
the wicked give occa&s;ion to the exerci&s;e
of many excellent di&s;po&s;itions of heart
among the righteous. They bring forth
<PB N="71" REF="80">
all the &s;uffering virtues, which otherwi&s;e
would have had no field; and by the
exerci&s;e of which the human character is
tried, and acquires &s;ome of its chief
honours. Were there no bad men in the
world to vex and di&s;tre&s;s the good, the
good might appear in the light of harm|le&s;s
innocence; but could have no op|portunity
of di&s;playing fidelity, magna|nimity,
patience, and fortitude. One half
of virtue, and not the lea&s;t important
half, would be lo&s;t to the world. In
our pre&s;ent imperfect &s;tate, any virtue
which is never exerci&s;ed is in hazard of
becoming extinct in the human brea&s;t.
If goodne&s;s con&s;tantly proceeded in a
&s;mooth and flowery path; if, meeting
with no adver&s;ary to oppo&s;e it, it were
&s;urrounded on every hand with acclama|tion
and prai&s;e, is there no ground to
dread that it might be corrupted by va|nity,
or might &s;ink into indolence? This
dangerous calm mu&s;t therefore be inter|rupted.
The waters mu&s;t be troubled,
le&s;t they &s;hould &s;tagnate and putrify.
<PB N="72" REF="81">
When you behold wicked men multiply|ing
in number, and increa&s;ing in power,
imagine not that Providence particularly
favours them. No; they are &s;uffered for
a time to pro&s;per, that they may fulfil
the high de&s;igns of heaven. They are
employed as in&s;truments in the hand of
God for the improvement of his &s;ervants.
They are the rods with which he cha&s;|tens
the virtuous, in order to rou&s;e them
from a dangerous&s; lumber; to form them
for the day of adver&s;ity, and to teach
them how to &s;uffer honourably.</P>
<P>IN the next place, the mixture of the
bad among the good &s;erves not only to
give exerci&s;e to the pa&s;&s;ive graces, but al|&s;o
to improve the active powers and vir|tues
of man. IT inures the righteous to
vigilance and exertion. It obliges them
to &s;tand forth, and act their part with
firmne&s;s and con&s;tancy in evil times. It
gives occa&s;ion for their virtues to &s;hine
with con&s;picuous lu&s;tre; and makes them
appear as <HI>the lights of the world</HI> amid&s;t
<PB N="73" REF="82">
&s;urrounding darkne&s;s. Were it not for
the dangers that ari&s;e from abounding
iniquity, there would be no opportunity
for courage to act, for wi&s;dom to admo|ni&s;h,
for caution to watch, nor for faith
to exert it&s;elf in <HI>overcoming the world.</HI> it
is that mixture of dispo&s;itions which now
takes place, that renders the theatre on
which we act &s;o bu&s;y and &s;tirring, and
&s;o much fitted for giving employment to
every part of man's intelligent and moral
nature. It affords a complete field for the
genuine di&s;play of characters; and gives e|very
man the opportunity to come forth
and &s;how what he is. Were the tenor of
human conduct altogether regular and uni|form,
interrupted by no follies and vices,
no cro&s;s di&s;po&s;itions and irregular pa&s;|&s;ions,
many of our active powers would
find no exerci&s;e. Perhaps even our life
would langui&s;h, and become too &s;till and
in&s;ipid. Man is not yet ripe for a para|di&s;e
of innocence, and for the enjoyment
of a perfect and faultle&s;s &s;ociety. As in
<PB N="74" REF="83">
the natural world, he is not made for
perpetual &s;pring and cloudle&s;s &s;kies, but
by the wintry &s;torm mu&s;t be called to ex|ert
his abilities for procuring &s;helter and
defence; &s;o in the moral world, the inter|mixture
of bad men renders many an ex|ertion
nece&s;&s;ary, which in a more perfect
&s;tate of the world would find no place,
but which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trial is
proper and u&s;eful.&mdash;The exi&s;tence of
vice in the world a&s;&s;uredly te&s;tifies our pre|&s;ent
corruption; and according to the de|gree
of its prevalence, is always, more or
le&s;s, the &s;ource of mi&s;ery. It is a &s;tand|ing
proof of the fall and degeneracy of
man. But as long as that fallen &s;tate
continues, the wi&s;dom of Providence e|minently
appears in making the errors
and frailties of the wicked &s;ub&s;ervient
to the improvement of the ju&s;t. <HI>Tares</HI>
are for that rea&s;on &s;uffered at pre&s;ent to
grow up <HI>among the wheat.</HI></P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations on the wi&s;dom of
Providence in this di&s;pen&s;ation will be
<PB N="75" REF="84">
farther illu&s;trated, by con&s;idering the u&s;e|ful
in&s;tructions which we receive, or
which at lea&s;t every wi&s;e man may re|ceive,
from the follies and vices of tho&s;e
among whom we are obliged to live.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They furni&s;h in&s;truction con|cerning
the &s;nares and dangers again&s;t
which we ought to be mo&s;t on our guard.
They put it thereby in our power to pro|fit
by the errors and mi&s;conduct of o|thers.
By ob&s;erving from what &s;mall
beginnings the greate&s;t crimes have a|ri&s;en;
ob&s;erving how bad company has
&s;educed this man from his original prin|ciples
and habits; how a carele&s;s indul|gence
of plea&s;ure has blinded and in|toxicated
that man; how the neglect of
divine in&s;titutions has, in another, gra|dually
paved the way for open profliga|cy;
much &s;alutary in&s;truction is con|veyed
to the virtuous. Tracing the dan|gerous
and &s;lippery paths by which &s;o
many have been in&s;en&s;ibly betrayed in|to
ruin, their views of human nature are
enlarged; the &s;en&s;e of their own imbe|cility
<PB N="76" REF="85">
is &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed upon them;
accompanied with the conviction of the
nece&s;&s;ity of a con&s;tant dependence on the
grace and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of heaven. All the
crimes which they behold di&s;turbing &s;o|ciety
around them, &s;erve as &s;ignals hung
out to them, beacons planted in their
view, to prevent their making &s;hipwreck
among tho&s;e rocks on which others have
&s;plit. It has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that not
only from the advices of his friends, but
from the reproaches of his enemies, a wi&s;e
man may draw in&s;truction. In the &s;ame
manner, it is not only by the examples
of good men, but likewi&s;e by tho&s;e of
the wicked, that an attentive mind may
be confirmed in virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Next,</HI> THESE examples of bad men,
while they admoni&s;h the virtuous of the
dangers again&s;t which they are to guard,
are farther porfitable by the views which
they exhibit of the evil and the defor|mity
of &s;in. Its odious nature never ap|pears
in &s;o &s;trong a light as when di&s;|played
<PB N="77" REF="86">
in the crimes of the wicked. It is
true that, when vice is carried only to a
certain degree, and di&s;gui&s;ed by plau&s;ible
colours, it may pa&s;s unreproved, and e|ven
for a while &s;eem popular in the
world. But it is no le&s;s true that, when
it becomes open and flagrant, and is de|prived
of the &s;hadow of virtue, it never
fails to incur general reproach, and, and to
become the object either of contempt or
of hatred. How often, for in&s;tance, have
the greate&s;t abilities, which once drew e|&s;teem
and admiration, &s;unk, in a &s;hort
time, into the mo&s;t humiliating degrada|tion,
merely through the a&s;cendant which
corrupted inclinations and low habits had
acquired over their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or? How of|ten
have the ri&s;ing honours of the young
been bla&s;ted, by their for&s;aking the path
of honour on which they had once enter|ed,
for the blind and crooked tracts of
depravity and folly? Such &s;pectacles of
the infamy of vice, &s;uch memorials of
the di&s;grace attending it, are permitted
by Providence for general in&s;truction;
<PB N="78" REF="87">
and a&s;&s;uredly are edifying to the world.
It was nece&s;&s;ary, for moral improvement,
that the beauty and excellence of virtue,
and the deformity of vice, &s;hould be
&s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed on every intelligent
mind. This could never be done with
&s;o great advantage as by the &s;triking con|tra&s;ts
of both which are produced by the
living examples of evil men intermixed
with the good. It is in this mirror that
we clearly contemplate how much the
<HI>righteous is more excellent than his neigh|bour.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;ame purpo&s;e of important in|&s;truction
is farther promoted by the in|&s;tances
of mi&s;ery which the &s;tate of wic|ked
men on earth affords. I admit that
the worldly &s;ucce&s;s, which &s;ometimes at|tends
them, may blind and &s;educe the
unwary; but a little more reflection ena|bles
men to di&s;tingui&s;h between apparent
&s;ucce&s;s and real happine&s;s. The condi|tion
of worthle&s;s men, whatever &s;plen|dor
riches may throw around them, is
<PB N="79" REF="88">
ea&s;ily di&s;cerned to be a re&s;tle&s;s and mi|&s;erable
one; and the mi&s;ery which they
&s;uffer, to be derived from their vices. In
that great corrupted crowd which &s;ur|rounds
us, what ince&s;&s;ant bu&s;tle and &s;tir,
what agitation and tumult take place?
What envy and jealou&s;y of one another?
How much bitterne&s;s of re&s;entment do
we behold among them; mutually de|ceiving
and deceived; &s;upplanting and
&s;upplanted; ever pur&s;uing, but never &s;a|tisfied?
The&s;e are not matters of rare ob|&s;ervations,
or which require nice &s;crutiny
to di&s;cover them. We need only open
our eyes to behold the wicked tormented
by their pa&s;&s;ions, and far removed from
that &s;anctuary of calmne&s;s and tranquil|lity
which is the abode of real happine&s;s.
Nay, when we appeal to bad men them|&s;elves,
after they have run the whole
round of vicious plea&s;ure, we will often
find them obliged to confe&s;s, that the
wretched re&s;ult of their pur&s;uits had been
<HI>vanity and vexation of &s;pirit;</HI> and that the
happie&s;t days they have enjoyed were in
<PB N="80" REF="89">
the time of innocence; before criminal
de&s;ires and guilty pa&s;&s;ions had taken
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their brea&s;ts. such practi|cal
demon&s;trations as the&s;e of the infe|licity
of &s;in are yielded by the exam|ples
of evil doers whom we &s;ee around
us. By attending to their &s;ituation, the
mi&s;ery, as well as infamy of guilt is reali|&s;ed,
an rendered &s;en&s;ible to our appre|hen&s;ion.</P>
<P>THUS, upon a fair inquiry, you be|hold
how the ways of God may, in this
remarkable ca&s;e, be ju&s;tified to man. You
behold what important ends are advan|ced,
by permitting the <HI>tares</HI> at pre&s;ent
to <HI>grow together with the wheat.</HI> The
intermixture of evil men in human &s;o|ciety
&s;erves to exerci&s;e the &s;uffering gra|ces
and virtues of the good; by the di|ver&s;ity
of characters among tho&s;e with
whom they have intercour&s;e, it &s;erves to
bring forth and improve their active
powers and virtues, and to enlarge the
circle of u&s;eful occupations; it &s;erves to
<PB N="81" REF="90">
in&s;truct them in the temptations again&s;t
which they are to guard, to reveal to
them all the deformity of vice, and to
make its mi&s;eries pa&s;s con&s;picuou&s;ly be|fore
their eyes. When we con&s;ider them
as actors on the theatre of the world, they
are thereby improved in the part they
have to perform. When we con&s;ider
them as &s;pectators of what is pa&s;&s;ing
on that theatre, their minds are thereby
in&s;tructed; their views rectified and en|larged
by the objects that are &s;et before
them.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e important truths,&s;everal
reflections no le&s;s important ari&s;e.</P>
<P>We are naturally taught, in the fir&s;t
place, never to be ha&s;ty in finding fault
with any of the arrangements of Provi|dence.
The pre&s;ent permi&s;&s;ion of moral
evil on the earth &s;eemed, on the fir&s;t
view, to furni&s;h a &s;trong objection again&s;t
either the wi&s;dom or the goodne&s;s of
the Author of nature. After beholding
the u&s;eful purpo&s;es which are an&s;wered
<PB N="82" REF="91">
by that permi&s;&s;ion, how cautious &s;hould
we be in advancing any of our ra&s;h &s;pe|culations
again&s;t his government and con|duct!
To our confined and humble &s;ta|tion
it belongs not to cen&s;ure, but to &s;ub|mit,
tru&s;t, and adore; &s;atisfied that the
farther we inquire, the rectitude of his
ways will appear the more; thankful for
the di&s;coveries of them which have been
imparted to us; and per&s;uaded that, where
our di&s;coveries fail, it is not becau&s;e there
is no more wi&s;dom or goodne&s;s to be &s;een,
but becau&s;e our pre&s;ent condition allows
us not to &s;ee more.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, let us be taught
with what eye we are to look upon tho&s;e
bad men whom we find around us in the
world. Not &s;urely with an eye of envy.
Whatever pro&s;perity they may &s;eem to
enjoy, they are &s;till no more than <HI>tares,</HI>
the weeds of the field; contemptible in
the &s;ight of God; tolerated by his pro|vidence
for a while on account of the righ|teous,
to who&s;e improvement they are
<PB N="83" REF="92">
rendered &s;ub&s;ervient. The parable in|forms
us that, in the end, they are to be
<HI>gathered together and burnt.</HI> In this life
only they have <HI>their good things.</HI> But
their prosperity is tran&s;itory. <HI>They are
brought into de&s;olation in a moment, and ut|terly
con&s;umed with terrors. As a dream
when one awaketh, &s;o, O God, when thou
awake&s;t, thou &s;halt de&s;pi&s;e their image</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm. lxxiii. 19, 20.</NOTE>.&mdash;
When we con&s;ider their unhappy &s;tate, it
becomes us to behold them with the eye
of pity. Let us remember that, in the
mid&s;t of their errors, they are by nature
&s;till our brethren. Let us not behave to
them in the &s;pirit of bitterne&s;s. In&s;ult
not their follies. Pride not your&s;elves
on &s;uperior virtue. Remember that, as
bad men are mixed with the good, &s;o, in
the be&s;t men, vices are at pre&s;ent mixed
with virtues. Your own character, good
as you may e&s;teem it, is not free from e|very
evil taint; and in the characters of
<PB N="84" REF="93">
tho&s;e whom you reprobate as vitious,
there are always &s;ome good qualities mix|ed
with the bad ones. Study, as far as
you can, to reclaim and amend them;
and if, in any degree, you have been pro|fited
by their failings, endeavour, in re|turn,
to profit them, by good coun&s;el and
advice; by advice, not admini&s;tered with
officious zeal, or &s;elf-conceited &s;uperiority,
but with the tenderne&s;s of compa&s;&s;ion
and real friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>In the third place, in whatever pro|portion
the admixture of vice may &s;eem
to take place in the world, let us never
de&s;pair of the prevalence of virtue on the
whole. Let us not exaggerate, beyond
mea&s;ure, the quantity of vice that is found
in the mixture. It is proper to ob&s;erve,
that in the parable now before us, after
the owner of the field had <HI>&s;own his good
&s;eed,</HI> no rea&s;on is given us to think, that
the good &s;eed was entirely chocked up by
<HI>tares.</HI> On the contrary, we are told that
<HI>the blade &s;prung up, and brought forth fruit;</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="94">
and, though the <HI>tares</HI> al&s;o aro&s;e, yet, in
the end there was a <HI>harve&s;et,</HI> when the
<HI>wheat was reaped and gathered into the
barn.</HI> In the mo&s;t corrupted times, God
never leaves him&s;elf without many wit|ne&s;&s;es
on earth. He is always attentive
to the cau&s;e of goodne&s;s; and frequent|ly
&s;upports and advances it by means
which we are unable to trace. He nou|ri&s;hes
much piety and virtue in hearts
that are unknown to us; and beholds re|pentance
ready to &s;pring up among ma|ny
whom we con&s;ider as reprobates.&mdash;I
know that it has always been common
for per&s;ons to repre&s;ent the age in which
they live as the wor&s;t that ever appeared;
and religion and virtue as ju&s;t on the
point of vani&s;hing from among men.
This is the language &s;ometimes of the &s;e|rious;
often of the hypocritical, or of
the narrow-minded. But true religion
gives no&s;anction to &s;uch &s;evere cen&s;ures,
or &s;uch gloomy views. Though the <HI>tares</HI>
mu&s;t be at all times &s;pringing up, there is
no rea&s;on for believing that they &s;hall
<PB N="86" REF="95">
ever over&s;pread the whole field. The
nature of the weeds that &s;pring up may
vary, according to the nature of the &s;oil.
Different modes of iniquity may di&s;tin|gui&s;h
different ages of the world; while
the &s;um of corruption is nearly the &s;ame.
Let not our judgements of men, and of
the times in which we live, be ha&s;ty and
pre&s;umptuous. Let us tru&s;t in the grace
of God; and hope the be&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>IN the fourth and la&s;t place, let us keep
our eyes ever fixed on that important pe|riod,
which is alluded to in the text, as
the conclu&s;ion of all. <HI>Let both grow to|gether
until the harve&s;t.</HI> The great &s;piri|tual
year is to be clo&s;ed by <HI>a harve&s;t,</HI>
when <HI>the hou&s;eholder is to gather the wheat
into his barn;</HI> when, at the end of the
world, the final di&s;tinction of men and
characters is to take place. The confu&s;ed
mixture of good and evil, which now pre|vails,
is only a temporary di&s;pen&s;ation of
Providence, accommodated to man's fal|len
and imperfect &s;tate. Let it not tempt
<PB N="87" REF="96">
us for a moment to di&s;tru&s;t the reality of
the divine government; or to entertain
the remote&s;t &s;u&s;picion that moral good
and evil are to be on the &s;ame terms for|ever.
The frailties of our nature fitted
us for no more at pre&s;ent than the enjoy|ment
of a very mixed and imperfect &s;|coiety.
But when our nature, purified and
refined, &s;hall become ripe for higher ad|vancement,
then &s;hall the &s;pirits of the
ju&s;t, de&s;engaged from any polluted mix|ture,
undi&s;turbed by &s;in or by &s;inners,
be united in one divine a&s;&s;embly, and re|joice
forever in the pre&s;ence of him who
made them. Looking forward to this glo|rious
i&s;&s;ue with &s;tedfa&s;t faith, let no cro&s;s
appearances ever di&s;comfit our hopes, or
lead us to &s;u&s;pect that we have been
&s;erving God in vain. If we continue
<HI>faithful to the death,</HI> we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured,
that in due time we &s;hall <HI>receive the crown
of life.</HI></P>

Throughout all ranks, the afflicted form
a con&s;iderable proportion of the human
race; and even they who have a title to
be called pro&s;perous, are always, in &s;ome
periods of their life, obliged to drink
from the cup of bitterne&s;s. The Chri&s;|tian
<PB N="89" REF="98">
religion is particularly entitled to our
regard, by accommodating it&s;elf with
great tenderne&s;s to this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condi|tion
of mankind. It is not to be con&s;i|dered
as merely an authoritative &s;y&s;tem of
precepts. Important precepts it indeed
delivers for the wi&s;e and proper re|gulation
of life. But the &s;ame voice
which enjoins our duty, utters the words
of con&s;olation. The go&s;pel de&s;erves to
be held a di&s;pen&s;ation of relief to man|kind
under both the temporal and &s;piri|tual
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of their &s;tate.</P>
<P>This amiable and compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit
of our religion con&s;picuou&s;ly appears in
the character of its great Author. It
&s;hone in all his actions while he lived on
earth. It breathed in all his di&s;cour&s;es;
and, in the words of the text, is expre&s;&s;ed
with much energy. In the preceding
ver&s;e, he had given a high account of his
own per&s;on and dignity. <HI>All things are
delivered unto me of my Father; and no
man knoweth the Son but the Father; nei|ther
knoweth any man the Father,&s;ave
<PB N="90" REF="99">
the Son, and he to whom&s;oever the Son will
reveal him.</HI> But lea&s;t any of his hearers
&s;hould be di&s;couraged by this my&s;terious
repre&s;entation of his greatne&s;s, he in&s;tant|ly
tempers it with the mo&s;t gracious be|nignity;
declaring, in the text, the mer|ciful
intention of his mi&s;&s;ion to the
world, <HI>Come unto me, all ye that labour,
and are heavy laden, and I will give you
re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE fir&s;t thing which claims our at|tention
in the&s;e words is, what we are to
under&s;tand by <HI>coming unto Chri&s;t.</HI> This
is a phra&s;e which has often given occa|&s;ion
to controver&s;y. By theological wri|ters
it has been involved in much need|le&s;s
my&s;tery, while the meaning is in it|&s;elf
plain and ea&s;y. The very metaphor
that is her u&s;ed &s;erves to explain it. In
the ancient world, di&s;ciples flocked round
their different teachers, and attended them
wherever they went; in order both to
te&s;tify their attachment, and to imbibe
more fully the doctrine of their ma&s;ters.
<PB N="91" REF="100">
<HI>Coming unto Chri&s;t,</HI> therefore, is the &s;ame
with re&s;orting to him as our declared
Ma&s;ter; acknowledging our&s;elves his di&s;|ciples,
believers in his doctrine, and fol|lowers
of his precepts. As Chri&s;t is made
known to us under the character both of
a Teacher and a Saviour, our <HI>coming to
him</HI> imports not only &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his
in&s;tructions, but confidence al&s;o in his
power to &s;ave. It imports that, for&s;aking
the corruptions of &s;in and the world, we
follow that cour&s;e of virtue and obe|dience
which he points out to us; rely|ing
on his mediation for pardon of our
offences, and acceptance with heaven.
This is what is implied in the &s;cripture
term <HI>Faith;</HI> which includes both the a&s;&s;ent
of the under&s;tanding to the truth of
the Chri&s;tian religion, and the concurrence
of the will in receiving it.</P>
<P>WHAT next occurs in the text to at|tract
our notice is the de&s;cription of tho&s;e
to whom the invitation is addre&s;&s;ed. All
tho&s;e who <HI>labour and are heavy laden,</HI>
<PB N="92" REF="101">
that is, who, in one way or other, feel
them&s;elves grieved and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, are
here invited to come to Chri&s;t.&mdash;Now,
from two &s;ources chiefly our di&s;tre&s;&s;es a|ri&s;e;
from moral, or from natural cau&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THEY may ari&s;e from inward
moral cau&s;es; from certain feelings and
reflexions of the mind, which occa&s;ion
unea&s;ine&s;s and pain. A cour&s;e of &s;in
and vice always proves ruinous and de|&s;tructive
in the i&s;&s;ue. But its tendency
to ruin is often not perceived, while that
tendency is advancing. For as &s;in is the
reign of pa&s;&s;ion and plea&s;ure, it forms
men to a thoughtle&s;s incon&s;iderate &s;tate.
Circum&s;tances, however, may occur, and
frequently, in the cour&s;e of life, do occur,
which di&s;clo&s;e to a vicious man the ruin
which he is bringing on him&s;elf, as an
offender again&s;t the God who made him.
When &s;ome occa&s;ional confinement to &s;o|litude,
or &s;ome turn of adver&s;e fortune,
directs his attention immediately upon
<PB N="93" REF="102">
his own character; or when, drawing to|wards
the clo&s;e of life, his pa&s;&s;ions &s;ub|&s;ide,
his plea&s;ures withdraw, and a future
&s;tate comes forward to his view; in &s;uch
&s;ituations it often happens, that the pa&s;t
follies and crimes of &s;uch a man appear to
him in a light mo&s;t odious and &s;hocking;
and not odious only, but terrifying to his
heart. He con&s;iders that he is undoubt|edly
placed under the government of a ju&s;t
God, who did not &s;end him into this world
for nought; that he has neglected the part
a&s;&s;igned to him; has contemned the laws
of heaven; has degraded his own nature;
and in&s;tead of being u&s;eful, having been
hurtful and pernicious to tho&s;e among
whom he lived, is about to leave a dete&s;|table
memory behind him.&mdash;What ac|count
&s;hall he give of him&s;elf to his Ma|ker?
Self condemned, polluted by &s;o many
crimes, how can he expect to find mercy
in his &s;ight?&mdash;Hence, an overwhelmed
and dejected mind; hence, di&s;mal forebo|dings
of puni&s;hment; hence, that <HI>wound|ed
&s;pirit,</HI> which, when it is deeply pierced,
<PB N="94" REF="103">
becomes the &s;ore&s;t of all human evils,
and has &s;ometimes rendered exi&s;tence a
burden which could not be endured.</P>
<P>Such di&s;tre&s;&s;es as the&s;e, ari&s;ing from
moral internal cau&s;es, may be made light
of by the giddy and the vain; and re|pre&s;ented
as confined to a few per&s;ons on|ly
of di&s;tempered imagination. But to
tho&s;e who&s;e profe&s;&s;ions give them occa&s;ion
to &s;ee men under various circum&s;tances
of affliction, they are known to be far
from being unfrequent in the world; and,
on many more occa&s;ions than is commonly
imagined, to throw over the human mind
the blacke&s;t gloom of which it is &s;u&s;cepti|ble.
Religious feelings, be a&s;&s;ured, have a
deep root in the nature of man. They form
a part of the human con&s;titution. They
are interwoven with many of tho&s;e fears
and hopes which actuate us in the chang|ing
&s;ituations of fortune. During the gay
and active periods of life, they may be
&s;mothered; but with mo&s;t men, they are
&s;mothered rather than totally obliterated:
And if any cri&s;is of our condition &s;hall a|waken
<PB N="95" REF="104">
and bring them forth, in their
full force, upon a con&s;cious guilty heart,
woe to the man, who, in &s;ome di&s;con|&s;olate
&s;ea&s;on, is doomed to &s;uffer their
extreme vengeance!</P>
<P>BUT, while under &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;es of
the mind not a few may be &s;aid to <HI>la|bour
and to be heavy laden,</HI> greater &s;till is
the multitude of tho&s;e who, from natural
external cau&s;es, from the calamities and
evils of life, undergo much &s;uffering and
mi&s;ery. The life of man is not indeed
wholly compo&s;ed of mi&s;ery. It admits
of many plea&s;ing &s;cenes. On the whole,
there is rea&s;on to believe that it affords
more joy than grief. At the &s;ame time,
the unfortunate, as I before ob&s;erved,
form always a numerous cla&s;s of man|kind;
and it may be &s;aid with truth, that
<HI>&s;ore travel is ordained for the &s;ons of men.</HI>
Though the burden is not equally laid on
all; &s;ome there always are, on whom it
falls with oppre&s;&s;ive weight.&mdash;Unexpect|ed
di&s;appointments have cru&s;hed their
<PB N="96" REF="105">
hopes, and bla&s;ted the plans which they
had formed for comfort in the world.
The world had, perhaps, &s;miled upon
them once, only to give them a &s;harper
feeling of its mi&s;eries at the la&s;t. Strug|gling
with poverty, unable to &s;upport
their families whom they &s;ee langui&s;hing
around them, they, at the &s;ame time, are
obliged by their &s;ituation in &s;ociety to
conceal their nece&s;&s;ities; and under the
forced appearance of cheerfulne&s;s, to hide
from the world a broken heart. They
are &s;tung, perhaps, by the unkindne&s;s of
friends: ca&s;t off by tho&s;e in whom they
had tru&s;ted; or torn by untimely death
from real friends, in connexion with
whom they might have flouri&s;hed and
been happy; at the &s;ame time borne
down, it may be, with the infirmities of
a &s;ickly body, and left to drag a painful
life without a&s;&s;i&s;tance or relief.&mdash;How
many &s;ad &s;cenes of this nature, on which
it were painful to in&s;i&s;t, does the world
afford?</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="106">
When we turn to tho&s;e who are ac|counted
pro&s;perous men, we &s;hall always
find many &s;orrows mingled with their
plea&s;ures; many hours of care and vexa|tion,
wherein they acknowledge them|&s;elves
cla&s;&s;ed with tho&s;e who <HI>labour and
are heavy laden.</HI> In entering into &s;ome
gay fe&s;tive a&s;&s;embly, we behold affected
chearfulne&s;s di&s;played on every counte|nance;
and might fancy that we had ar|rived
at the temple of unmixed plea&s;ure
and gladne&s;s of heart. Yet, even there,
could we look into the bo&s;oms of the&s;e
apparently happy per&s;ons, how often
would we find them inwardly prey|ed
upon by &s;ome tormenting &s;u&s;picions,
&s;ome anxious fears, &s;ome &s;ecret griefs,
which either they dare not di&s;clo&s;e to
the world, or from which, if di&s;clo&s;ed,
they can look for no relief?&mdash;In &s;hort,
amid&s;t that great company of pilgrims,
who are journeying through life, many
there are who&s;e journey lies through a
valley of tears; and many to whom that
<PB N="98" REF="107">
valley is only cheared by tran&s;ient glimp|&s;es
of joy.</P>
<P>To the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of mankind is addre&s;|&s;ed
the invitation of the text. To them,
it is in a particular manner adder&s;&s;ed;
overlooking the giddy and di&s;&s;ipated mul|titude.
<HI>Come unto me all ye that labour,

were always ready to accept that
&s;ort of piety which is merely the con&s;e|quence

fear or danger to have recour&s;e to him.
His words are to be under&s;tood as inti|mating,

his compa&s;&s;ionate regard; that he will
not reject us merely becau&s;e we have been
ca&s;t off by the world; but that, if with
proper di&s;po&s;itions and &s;entiments we apply
to him in the evil day, we &s;hall be &s;ure of
meeting with a gracious reception. It now
remains to &s;how, what that reception is
which we may look for; what that <HI>re&s;t</HI>
<PB N="99" REF="108">
in which Chri&s;t hath promi&s;ed to confer
on tho&s;e who <HI>come to him;</HI> whether their
di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;e from moral or from natu|ral
cau&s;es. <HI>Come unto me, and I will give
you re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>I. CHRIST affords re&s;t to the di&s;turb|ed
mind that labours under apprehen|&s;ions
and fears of guilt. Let tho&s;e who
&s;uffer di&s;tre&s;s of this nature <HI>come to Chri&s;t,</HI>
that is, with contrition and repentance,
have recour&s;e to him as their Saviour,
and they &s;hall regain quietne&s;s and peace.
Fooli&s;h and guilty they have been, and
ju&s;tly lie under dread of puni&s;hment; but
the penitent &s;orrow which they now feel,
implies their di&s;po&s;ition to be changed. It
implies, as far as it is genuine, that, &s;en&s;ible
of their folly, they now de&s;ire to become
good and wi&s;e; and are determined for
the future to hold a virtuous cour&s;e, could
they only hope to obtain pardon for the
pa&s;t. In this &s;ituation of mind, let them
not be ca&s;t down and de&s;pair. Chri&s;t has
brought with him from heaven the olive
<PB N="100" REF="109">
branch. He carries in his hand the &s;ig|nal
of forgivene&s;s. The declaration which
he public&s;hes is, <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his
way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;
and let him return to the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him; and to our
God, for he will abundantly pardon</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah lv. 7.</NOTE>. In|&s;ufficient
though our own repentance
be, to procure pardon from heaven, we
are informed, that an all-&s;ufficient atonc|ment
has been made by Chri&s;t. Neither
the number nor the atrocity of offences
excludes, from forgivene&s;s, the penitent
who returns to his duty. To all who
come under this de&s;cription, the offer of
mercy extends, without exception. <HI>He
that &s;pared not his own Son, but delivered
him up for us all, how &s;hall be not with
him al&s;o freely give us all things</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 32.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>This di&s;covery of divine government,
afforded by the Go&s;pel, is perfectly cal|culated
to &s;catter the gloom which had
<PB N="101" REF="110">
overca&s;t the de&s;ponding heart. The at|mo&s;phere
clears up on every &s;ide; and is
illuminated by chearing rays of cele&s;tial
mercy. Not only is hope given to the
penitent, but it is rendered &s;inful not to
indulge that hope. We are not only al|lowed
and encouraged, but we are com|manded
to tru&s;t in the divine clemency.
We are commanded to believe that <HI>none
who come unto Chri&s;t he will in any wi&s;e

ways; for why will ye die, $ hou&s;e of I&s;|rael</HI>
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 11.</NOTE>&mdash;Such is the relief which the
religion of Chri&s;t brings to them who
<HI>labour and are heavy laden</HI> under the im|pre&s;&s;ions
of guilt and diving di&s;plea&s;ure;
a relief which nothing can render ineffec|tual
to the heart, except the mo&s;t gloomy
&s;upper&s;tition, founded on gro&s;s mi&s;concep|tions
<PB N="102" REF="111">
of the nature and attributes of God.
Let us now,</P>
<P>II. Con&s;ider what <HI>re&s;t</HI> the religion of
Chri&s;t gives to them who&s;e di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;es
not from inward and moral, but from
natural and external cau&s;es; from ad|ver&s;e
fortune, or any of tho&s;e numerous
calamities to which we are at pre&s;ent ex|po&s;ed.
To &s;uch per&s;ons, it may &s;eem
more difficult to promi&s;e any effectual
relief. In the former ca&s;e, the di&s;tre&s;s
lay entirely in the mind. As &s;oon as its
views are rectified, and its apprehen&s;ions
quieted, the evil is removed, and the cure
effected. Here, the di&s;tre&s;s ari&s;es from
without; and the religion of Chri&s;t af|fects
not the cour&s;e of external events.
But though it removes not all the evils
of life, though it promi&s;es no continuance
of unde&s;turbed pro&s;perity, (which indeed
it were not &s;alutary for man always to
enjoy) yet, if it mitigates the evils which
nece&s;&s;arily belong to our &s;tate, and &s;up|ports
us under them, it may ju&s;tly be
<PB N="103" REF="112">
&s;aid to give <HI>re&s;t to them who labour and
are heavy laden.</HI> When much that is
material and important is effected, we
have no cau&s;e to complain, though all
that we de&s;ire be not acompli&s;hed.&mdash;In
this part of the di&s;cour&s;e, I am to be con|&s;idered
as adder&s;&s;ing my&s;elf not merely to
&s;uch as are at pre&s;ent &s;uffering any &s;evere
calamity. I now &s;peak to many, who,
in the mid&s;t of health and affluence, en|joy
the various comforts of life. But I
mu&s;t de&s;ire &s;uch per&s;ons to look forward
to what may one day be their &s;tate. Let
them reflect how important it is to pre|pare
them&s;elves for the future unknown
vici&s;&s;itudes of the world. For, <HI>if a man
live many years, and rej$ice in them all, yet
let him remember the days of darken&s;s, for
they &s;hall be many</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. xi. 8.</NOTE>.&mdash;Now, either in the
pro&s;pect of future di&s;tre&s;s, or under pre|&s;ent
&s;uffering. I &s;ay, that the religion of
Chri&s;t gives <HI>re&s;t</HI> to the heart, by the for|titude
<PB N="104" REF="113">
which it in&s;pires, and by the con|&s;olations
which it affords.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT in&s;pires fortitude. It di&s;co|vers
a &s;upreme admini&s;tration, &s;o friend|ly
to the intere&s;ts of goodne&s;s, as never
to allow the followers of Chri&s;t to dread,
that, in any &s;ituation of fortune, they
&s;hall be neglected by Heaven. From the
ab&s;tract con&s;ideration of the divine per|fections,
men had always &s;ome ground to
believe, that the general order of the uni|ver&s;e
was con&s;ulted by its great Ruler.
But how far the intere&s;t of individuals
might be obliged to yield, or, in many ca|&s;es
might be &s;acrificed, to this general or|der,
they were left altogether in the dark.
Here the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t comes to our
aid, by the explicit a&s;&s;urance which it
gives, that, in the great &s;y&s;tem of Provi|dence,
the welfare of every &s;ingle good
man is particularly included. <HI>All things,</HI>
we are expre&s;sly told, are made to <HI>work
together,</HI> not merely for the order and per|fection
of the whole, but al&s;o <HI>for good to
<PB N="105" REF="114">
them who love God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 28.</NOTE>. The life of every
per&s;on, who comes under this de&s;cription,
forms a &s;y&s;tem complete within ite&s;elf;
where every event that happens to him
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es its de&s;tined place, and forms a
link in that great chain of cau&s;es, which
was appointed, from the beginning of
things, for carrying on his improvement
and felicity. Such an arrangement of
the affairs of the world, may appear a&s;to|ni&s;hing
to our narrow capacities; yet
&s;urely implies no effort beyond the reach
of infinite power, joined with infinite wi&s;|dom
and goone&s;s.</P>
<P>Hence ari&s;es a degree of fortitude and
con&s;tancy to good men, which can upon
no other grounds be attained. Faith, in
the&s;e principles of the go&s;pel, erects for
them a fortre&s;s, impregnable to the a&s;|&s;aults
of the world, into which they can
at all times retreat. Sitting under the
&s;helter of divine protection, they calmly
<PB N="106" REF="115">
hear the &s;torm, when it blows with its
utmo&s;t violence around them. <HI>The &s;toods
have lifted up their voice; they have lifted
up all their waves. But the Lord on high
is mightier than the noi&s;e of many waters;
yea, than the mighty waves of the &s;ea</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xciii. 34.</NOTE>.
Of the man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;uch principles,
it is ju&s;tly &s;aid, <HI>His heart is e&s;tabli&s;hed; he
&s;hall not be afraid of $vil tidings; his heart
is fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. cxii. 7, 8.</NOTE>. Tranquil|lity,
order, and magnanimity, dwell with
him; while all is confu&s;ion and trepida|tion
among tho&s;e, who have nothing to
look to but the apparent di&s;orders of the
world.</P>
<P>THE doctrine of Chri&s;t not only arms us,
in this manner, with fortitude again&s;t the
approach of evil; but, &s;uppo&s;ing evils to fall
upon us with their heavie&s;t pre&s;&s;ure, it
lightens the load by many con&s;olations to
which others are &s;trangers. While bad men
<PB N="107" REF="116">
trace, in the calamities with which they
are vi&s;ited, the hand of an offended &s;o|vereign,
Chri&s;tians are taught to view
them as the well-intended cha&s;ti&s;ements
of a merciful Father. They hear amid&s;t
them, that &s;till voice which a good con|&s;cience
brings to their ear: <HI>Fear not, for
I am with thee; be not di&s;mayed, for I am
thy God</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xli. 10.</NOTE>. They apply to them&s;elves
the comfortable promi&s;es with which the
go&s;pel abounds. They di&s;cover in the&s;e
the happy i&s;&s;ue decreed to their troubles;
and wait with patience till Providence
&s;hall have accompli&s;hed its great and good
de&s;igns. In the mean time, devotion o|pens
to them its ble&s;&s;ed and holy &s;anctua|ry:
That &s;anctuary in which the wound|ed
heart is healed, and the weary mind
is at re&s;t; where the cares of the world
are forgotten, where its tumults are hu&s;h|ed,
and its mi&s;eries di&s;appear; where
greater objects open to our view than
<PB N="108" REF="117">
what the world pre&s;ents; where a more
&s;erene &s;l$y &s;hines, and a &s;we$ter and
calmer light beams on the afflicted heart.
In tho&s;e moments of devotion, a pious
man, pouring out his wants and &s;orrows
to an almighty Supporter, feels that he is
not left &s;olitary and for&s;aken in a vale
of woe. God is with him; Chri&s;t and
the Holy Gho&s;t are with him; and though
he &s;hould be bereaved of every earthly
friend, he can look up in heaven to a Friend
who will never die.</P>
<P>To the&s;e pre&s;ent con&s;olations, the re|ligion
of Chri&s;t adds the joyful pro&s;pect
of that future &s;tate, where eternal <HI>re&s;t re|ma$eth
for the people of God.</HI> This life
they are taught to con&s;ider as only the
<HI>hou&s;e of th$$ pilgrimage;</HI> the temporary
man&s;ion of painful though nece&s;&s;ary di&s;|cipline.
But let them endure for a little,
and the pilgrimage &s;hall end, the di&s;ci|pline
&s;hall be fini&s;hed; and all the vir|tuous
be a&s;&s;embled in tho&s;e bli&s;sful re|gions
which are prepared for their re|ward.
Such a pro&s;pect chears the dark|e&s;t
<PB N="109" REF="118">
hours of life; and affords a remedy
to every trouble. <HI>The &s;ufferings of this
pre&s;ent time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory which &s;hall be revealed</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 18.</NOTE>.
They appear in this comparative view,
as no more than a di&s;tre&s;&s;ing dream of
the night, from which one awakes into
health, and light, and joy.&mdash;Peculiar is
this high con&s;olation to the religion of
Chri&s;t. It is what all nations had eager|ly
wi&s;hed for; what all philo&s;ophy had
anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to di&s;cover; but what
no re&s;earch, no philo&s;ophy were able to
a&s;certain to mankind, till Chri&s;t brought
the a&s;&s;urance of life and immortality from
heaven; and conferred on his di&s;ciples
this noble and ine&s;timable gift.</P>
<P>THUS, on the whole, the Chri&s;tian doc|trine
is found to be the great Medicine of
life. It is the balm of human &s;orrows and
cares. In our pre&s;ent &s;tate, where &s;o ma|ny
<PB N="110" REF="119">
are &s;uffering actual di&s;tre&s;s, of one kind
or other, and where all have rea&s;on to
dread the approach of di&s;tre&s;s, it is religion
only that can alleviate the burdens of life,
and &s;mooth our pa&s;&s;age through this evil
world.&mdash;Let this view of religion per|&s;uade
us to improve the &s;acred ordinance
of our Lord's &s;upper for <HI>coming unto Chri&s;t,</HI>
in the way before explained: that is, join|ing
our&s;elves to him as his di&s;ciples; his
di&s;ciples, not in words and profe&s;&s;ions on|ly,
but in heart, and in truth; <HI>taking upon
us his yoke,</HI> as is added in the words imme|diately
following the text; <HI>and learning of
him who is meek and lowly in heart.</HI> Let
tho&s;e who labour under the &s;en&s;e of re|membered
follies and crimes, <HI>c$me unto
Chri&s;t</HI> with penitent di&s;oi&s;itions, and they
&s;hall obtain pardon. Let tho&s;e who la|bour
under the &s;uffering of pre&s;ent, or
the apprehen&s;ion of future &s;orrows, <HI>come
unto Chri&s;t,</HI> and they &s;hall receive con&s;o|lation.
All who are in any &s;en&s;e <HI>heavy laden,</HI>
coming unto him, &s;hall find <HI>re&s;t</HI> to
their &s;ouls.</P>

<Q>The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT appears from many pa&s;&s;ages in the
writings of this prophet,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. VI.</NOTE> that in his
days great corruption of manners had be|gun
to take place among the people of
I&s;rael. Originally a &s;ober and a religious
nation, accu&s;tomed to a &s;imple and pa&s;|toral
life, after they had enlarged their
<PB N="114" REF="123">
territories by conque&s;t, and acquired
wealth by commerce, they gradually con|tracted
habits of luxury; and luxury
&s;oon introduced its u&s;ual train of attend|ing
evils. In the hi&s;tory of all nations,
the &s;ame circulation of manners has been
found; and the age in which we live re|&s;embles,
in this respect, the ages which
have gone before it. Forms of iniquity
may vary; but the corrupt propen&s;ities
of men remain at all times much the
&s;ame; and revolutions from primitive
&s;implicity to the re&s;inements of criminal
luxury have been often exhibited on the
&s;tage of the world. The reproof direct|ed
in the text to the Jews of that an|tient
age, will be found equally appli|cable
to the manners of many, in mo|dern
times. In di&s;cour&s;ing from it, I
&s;hall fir&s;t con&s;ider the character of tho&s;e
who are de&s;cribed in the text, and &s;how
the guilt that is involved in it. I &s;hall
next con&s;ider the duties which per&s;ons
of that character are &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="115" REF="124">
neglected; to <HI>regard the work of the Lord,
and to con&s;ider the operation of his hands.</HI></P>
<P>I. WHEN we take into view the cha|racter
pointed at in the text, it is evident
that what the prophet means to reprove
is, the &s;pirit of incon&s;iderate di&s;&s;ipation,
of intemperate indulgence, and irreligious
luxury. It is not <HI>the fea&s;t and the wine, the
harp and the viol,</HI> which he means to
condemn. Ma&s;ic and wine are, in them|&s;elves,
things of innocent nature: Nay,
when temperately enjoyed, they may be
employed for u&s;eful purpo&s;es; for af|fording
relaxation from the oppre&s;&s;ive
cares of life, and for promoting friendly
intercour&s;e among men. The opulent
are not prohibited from enjoying the
good things of this world, which Pro|vidence
has be&s;towed upon them. Re|ligion
neither aboli&s;hes the di&s;tinction of
ranks, (as the vain philo&s;ophy of &s;ome
would teach us to do), nor interferes
with a mode&s;t and decent indulgence of
plea&s;ure.&mdash;It is the criminal abu&s;e of
<PB N="116" REF="125">
plea&s;ure which is here cen&s;ured; that
thoughtle&s;s and intemperate enjoyment
of it which wholly ab&s;orbs the time and
attention of men; which obliterates eve|ry
&s;erious thought of the proper bu&s;ine&s;s
of life; an effaces the &s;en&s;e of religion
and of God.</P>
<P>It may be proper to remark, that it is
not open and direct impiety, which is
laid to the charge of the per&s;ons here
characteri&s;ed. It is not &s;aid, that in their
fea&s;ts they &s;co&s;fed at religion, or bla&s;phe|med
the name of God. To this &s;ummit
of wickedne&s;s the&s;e per&s;ons had not yet
arrived; perhaps, the age in which they
lived gave not its countenance to this
wantonne&s;s of impiety. It is merely a
negative crime of which they are accu|&s;ed;
that they, <HI>regarded not the work of
the Lord, neither con&s;idered the operation of
his hands.</HI> But this ab&s;ence of all religious
impre&s;&s;ions is here pointed out, as &s;uffi|cient
to &s;tigmati&s;e their characters with
guilt. As &s;oon as the &s;en&s;e of a Supreme
Being is lo&s;t, the great check is taken
<PB N="117" REF="126">
off which keeps under re&s;traint the pa&s;|&s;ions
of men. Mean de&s;ires, and low
plea&s;ures, take place of the greater and
nobler &s;entiments which rea&s;on and re|ligion
in&s;pire. Amid&s;t the tumult of <HI>the
wine and the fea&s;t,</HI> all proper views of hu|man
life are forgotten. The duties which,
as men, they have to perform, the part
they have to act in the world, and the
di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which they are expo&s;ing them|&s;elves,
are bani&s;hed from their thoughts.
<HI>To-morrow &s;hall be as this day, and more
abundantly,</HI> is the only voice. Inflamed
by &s;ociety, and circulated from one loo&s;e
companion to another, the &s;pirit of riot
grows and &s;wells, till it end in brutal
exce&s;s.</P>
<P>Were &s;uch di&s;orders rare and occa&s;ion|al
merely, they might perhaps be for|gotten
and forgiven. But, nouri&s;hed by
repetition and habit, they grow up among
too many, to become the bu&s;ine&s;s and oc|cupation
of life. By the&s;e unfortunate
votaries of plea&s;ure, they are accounted
e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s. Life appears to
<PB N="118" REF="127">
&s;tagnate without them. Having no re|&s;ource
within them&s;elves, their &s;pirits
&s;ink, and their very being &s;eems annihi|lated,
till the return of their favourite
plea&s;ures awaken within them &s;ome tran|&s;ient
&s;parkles of joy.&mdash;Idlene&s;s, ea&s;e, and
pro&s;perity, have too natural a tendency

hours of life, which recal men to recol|lection
and wi&s;dom. They &s;how to the
unthinking what this world really is, and
what may be expected from it. But the
day that is always bright and unclouded,
is not made for men. It flatters them
with the dangerous illu&s;ion, that it is in
their power to render life one &s;cene of
plea&s;ure; and that they have no other
bu&s;ine&s;s on earth, but to &s;pread the <HI>fea&s;t,</HI>
and call <HI>&s;the harp and the</HI> viol to &s;ound.
<PB N="119" REF="128">
But the examples are &s;o frequent, of the
dangers and the crimes which ari&s;e from an
intemperate abu&s;e of plea&s;ure, that on this
part of the &s;ubject it &s;eems needle&s;s to in|&s;i&s;t
any longer. I proceed, therefore,</P>
<P>II. To con&s;ider the duties which men
are accu&s;ed of having neglected; and
which, it is here &s;uppo&s;ed, if duly at|tended
to, would have acted as the cor|rectives
of di&s;&s;olute and irreligious lux|ury;
the&s;e are, to <HI>regard the work of the
Lord,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider the operation of his
hands.</HI>&mdash;By recommending &s;uch duties, I
do not mean to repre&s;ent it as requi&s;ite
that the fea&s;t &s;hould be turned into an
act of wor&s;hip; that the countenances of
men &s;hould be always grave; or that,
in the hours of amu&s;ement and of &s;ocial
fe&s;tivity, no &s;ubject may employ their
thoughts and their di&s;cour&s;e, except God
and a future &s;tate. All extremes in re|ligion
are dangerous; and, by carrying
au&s;terity too far, we are in hazard of
only promoting hypocri&s;y. But though
<PB N="120" REF="129">
&s;ome, in the la&s;t age, might be prone to
this extreme; yet, at the pre&s;ent day,
there is not much occa&s;ion for warn|ing
men again&s;t it.&mdash;What I now in|&s;i&s;t
upon is, that all our plea&s;ures ought
to be tempered with a &s;erious &s;en&s;e of
God; that &s;cenes of gaiety and enjoy|ment
&s;hould never make us forget that
we are &s;ubjects of his government, and
have a part allotted as to act in his world;
that on no occa&s;ion they &s;hould be pro|longed
&s;o much, repeated &s;o often, or &s;uf|fered
to tran&s;port us &s;o far, as to lead us
to break any of the divine laws, or to act
incon&s;i&s;tently with the character of men
and Chri&s;tians. A prevailing &s;en&s;e of
God on the mind is to be ever held the
&s;ure&s;t guard of innocence and virtue, a|mid&s;t
the allurements of plea&s;ure. It is
the &s;alutary mixture which mu&s;t be in|fu&s;ed
into the cup of joy, in order to ren|der
it &s;afe and innoxious.</P>
<P>This &s;en&s;e of God &s;hould lead us, in
the language of the prophet, to <HI>regard the
work of the Lord,</HI> and to <HI>con&s;ider the ope|ration
<PB N="121" REF="130">
of his hands;</HI> which expre&s;&s;ions may
be under&s;tood as requiring us to have
God upon our thoughts under two views;
<HI>to regard his work,</HI> as the Author of na|ture;
and <HI>to con&s;ider the operation of his
hands,</HI> as the Governor of the world.
Let us attend more particularly to each
of the&s;e views of the Supreme Being.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, we are to view God
as the Author of nature, <HI>or to regard the
work of the Lord.</HI> With his works we
are in every place &s;urrounded. We can
ca&s;t our eyes no where, without di&s;cern|ing
the hand of Him who formed them,
if the gro&s;sne&s;s of our minds will only
allow us to behold Him. Let giddy and
thoughtle&s;s men turn a&s;ide a little from
the haunts of riot. Let them &s;tand &s;till,
and contemplate the wondrous works of
God; and make trial of the effect which
&s;uch contemplation would produce.&mdash;It
were good for them that, even indepen|dently
of the Author, they were more
acquainted with his works; good for
<PB N="122" REF="131">
them, that from the &s;ocieties of loo&s;e and
di&s;&s;olute men, they would retreat to the
&s;cenes of nature; would oftener dwell
among them, and enjoy their beauties.
This would form them to the reli&s;h of
uncorrupted, innocent plea&s;ures; and
make them feel the value of calm enjoy|ments,
as &s;uperior to the noi&s;e and tur|bulence
of licentious gaiety. From the
harmony of nature, and of nature's
works, they would learn to hear &s;weeter
&s;ounds than what ari&s;e from <HI>the viol, the
tab$et, and the pipe.</HI></P>
<P>But to higher and more &s;erious thoughts
the&s;e works of nature give occa&s;ion, when
con&s;idered in conjunction with the Creator
who made them.&mdash;Let me call on you,
my friends, to catch &s;ome interval of
reflection, &s;ome &s;erious moment, for look|ing
with thoughtful eye on the world a|round
you. Lift your view to that im|men&s;e
arch of heaven which encompa&s;|&s;es
you above. Behold the &s;un in all
his &s;plendor rolling over your head by
day; and the moon, by night, in mild
<PB N="123" REF="132">
and &s;crene maje&s;ty, &s;urrounded with that
ho&s;t of &s;tars which pre&s;ent to your ima|gination
an innumerable multitude of
worlds. Li&s;ten to the awful voice of
thunder. Li&s;ten to the roar of the tem|pe&s;t
and the ocean. Survey the wonders
that fill the earth which you inhabit.
Contemplate a &s;teady and powerful Hand,
bringing round &s;pring and &s;ummer, au|tumn
and winter, in regular cour&s;e; de|corating
this earth with innumerable
beauties, diver&s;ifying it with innumerable
inhabitants; pouring forth comforts on
all that live; and, at the &s;ame time, over|awing
the nations with the violence of
the elements, when it plea&s;es the Creator
to let them forth.&mdash;After you have view|ed
your&s;elves as &s;urrounded with &s;uch a
&s;cene of wonders; after you have beheld
on every hand, &s;uch an a&s;toni&s;hing di&s;|play

which whi&s;pers you within, that to
this great Creator reverence and homage
<PB N="124" REF="133">
are due by all the rational beings whom
he has made? Admitted to be &s;pectators of

believe that you were brought hither for
no purpo&s;e; but to immer&s;e your&s;elves in
gro&s;s and brutal, or, at be&s;t, in trifling
plea&s;ures; lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of the wonders
you behold; lo&s;t to all reverence of that
God who gave you being, and who has
erected this amazing fabric of nature, on
which you look only with &s;tupid and un|meaning
eyes?&mdash;No: Let the &s;cenes which
you behold prompt corre&s;pondent feel|ings.
Let them awaken you from the
degrading intoxication of licentious&s;ne&s;s,
into nobler emotions. Every object which
you view in nature, whether great or
&s;mall, &s;erves to in&s;truct you. The &s;tar
and the infect, the fiery meteor and the
flower of &s;pring, the verdant field and the
lofty mountain, all exhibit a &s;upreme
Power, before which you ought to trem|ble
and adore; all preach the doctrine,
all in&s;pire the &s;pirit, of devotion, and reve|rence.
<PB N="125" REF="134">
<HI>Regarding,</HI> then, <HI>the work of the

&s;entiments as the&s;e:&mdash;&startq; Lord, wherever

magnificent temple of the univer&s;e,
where thou ha&s;t placed me, may I ever
be thy faithful wor&s;hipper; and may
the reverence and the fear of God be
the fir&s;t &s;entiments of my heart! &endq;&mdash;It
is to &s;uch con&s;ideration of God I would
now recal your thoughts, from the <HI>wine

and becoming &s;entiments, in the place of
criminal di&s;&s;ipation. But,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, there is a con&s;ide|ration
of a nature &s;till more &s;erious, to be
employed for the &s;ame purpo&s;e; the con|&s;ideration
of God as not only the Author
of nature, but the Governor of his crea|tures.
<PB N="126" REF="135">
While we <HI>regard the work of the
Lord,</HI> we are al&s;o to <HI>con&s;ider the</HI> never cea&s;|ing
<HI>operation of his hands.</HI> We are to look
up to an awful and ire&s;i&s;tible Providence,
&s;tretching its arm over our head; di|recting
the fate of men, and di&s;pen&s;ing at
its plea&s;ure happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. In the
giddy moments of jollity, the wantorn and
thoughtle&s;s are apt to &s;ay; &startq; <HI>Let us eat and

is better for man, than to rejoice as
much as he can all the days of his vain

by &s;upper&s;titious terrors. He who &s;it|teth
in the heavens be&s;tows no minute
attention on the &s;ons of earth. He per|mits
<HI>all things to come alike to all; one
event to happen to be</HI> righteous and to the
wicket. &endq;&mdash;Be a&s;&s;ured, my brethren, it
is not &s;o. You greatly deceive your|&s;elves,
by imagining that your Creator
and Governor is indifferent to the part
you are now acting; or that the di&s;tri|bution
of good and evil, which now takes
<PB N="127" REF="136">
place, has no relation to your moral con|duct.
In &s;ome in&s;tances, that relation
may not be apparent, becau&s;e the moral
government of God is not completed in
this world. But a multitude of proofs
&s;how government to be already begun;
and point out to you the train in which
you may expect it to proceed.</P>
<P>In the hi&s;tory of all ages and nations,
you cannot but have ob&s;erved a thou&s;and
in&s;tances, in which <HI>the operation of the divine
hand</HI> has been di&s;played; overtaking evil
doers &s;ooner or later with puni&s;hment, and
bringing on their own heads the ruin they
had devi&s;ed for others. You are not to i|magine
that this di&s;plea&s;ure of Providence
is exerted only agin&s;t the ambitious, the
treacherous, and the cruel, who are the au|thors
of exten&s;ive mi&s;ery to the world. Un|der
this idea, perhaps, you may be de&s;irous
to &s;helter your&s;elves, that your exce&s;&s;es are
of a harmle&s;s kind; that you &s;eek nothing
more than the enjoyment of your own plea|ures;
that your <HI>fea&s;t</HI> and your <HI>wine</HI>
<PB N="128" REF="137">
interfere not with the order of the world;
and that therefore you have done nothing
which &s;hould awaken the &s;leeping thun|der,
and bring it down from heaven on
you heads. Though not &s;tained with
the blacke&s;t colours of guilt, your con|duct
may neverthele&s;s be highly offen|&s;ive
to the Ruler of the world. His go|vernment
is not of that indolent inatten|tive
kind, which allows impunity to eve|ry
le&s;&s;er criminal. He beholds with di&s;|plea&s;ure
the behaviour of tho&s;e who de|grade
their nature by vitious di&s;orders;
and contaminate, by their example, every
&s;ociety with which they are connected.

or other, they &s;hall &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Look around the circle of your ac|quaintance,

virtuous, who vi&s;ibly pro&s;per in the world,
and ri&s;e into reputation and influence; ob|&s;erve
whether the licentious and intem|perate
are not con&s;tantly humbled and
<PB N="129" REF="138">
checked by &s;ome dark rever&s;e either in
their health or their fortune; whether
the irreligious and profligate are ever
&s;uffered to e&s;cape long, without being
marked with infamy, and becoming ob|jects
of contempt.&mdash;I a&s;k, to what cau&s;e
this is to be a&s;cribed, but to that <HI>opera|tion
of the hand of God,</HI> which I am now
calling you to con&s;ider? Does it not obvi|ou&s;ly
carry the marks of a plan, a &s;y&s;tem
of things, contrived and fore-ordained by
Providence, for rewarding virtue, and pu|ni&s;hing
vice in every form of its di&s;or|ders?&mdash;The
Governor of the world need
not for this purpo&s;e &s;tep from this throne,
or put forth his hand from the coluds.
With admirable wi&s;dom he hath &s;o or|dered
the train of human affairs, that, in
their natural cour&s;e, mens <HI>own wickedne&s;s
&s;hall reprove them, and their back&s;$dings
correct them; that they &s;hall be made to eat
the fruit of their doings, and to fall into the
pit which them&s;elves bad digged.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="139">
The&s;e things have been always &s;o ap|parent
to ob&s;ervation, that though a man
may have been &s;educed into irregular
and evil cour&s;es during his life, yet, at
the clo&s;e of it, it &s;eldom happens but he
di&s;cerns their pernicious nature, and con|demns
him&s;elf for them. Never, per|haps,
was there a father, who, after he
had &s;pend his days in idlene&s;s, di&s;&s;ipation,
and luxury, did not, when dying, admo|ni&s;h
the children whom he loved, to hold
a more honourable cour&s;e, to follow the
paths of virtue, to fear God, and to fulfil
properly the duties of their &s;tation.&mdash;To
your&s;elves, indeed, I can confidently ap|peal,
whether what I am now &s;aying, be
not confirmed by your own te&s;timony.
After you have been guilty of &s;ome cri|minal
acts, in the cour&s;e of tho&s;e riotous
plea&s;ures which you indulge, have you
not, at certain times, felt the &s;tings of
remor&s;e? Were you not obliged to con|fe&s;s
to your&s;elves that a &s;ad pro&s;pect of
mi&s;ery was opening before you, if &s;uch
exce&s;&s;es were to continue? Did you not
<PB N="131" REF="140">
hear an inward voice upbraiding you for
having &s;unk and degraded your charac|ter
&s;o far below that of many of your
equals around you?&mdash;My friends, what
was this but the voice of God, &s;peaking,
as the Governor of his creatures, within
your heart; te&s;tifying loudly that your
cour&s;e of life was di&s;plea&s;ing to him;
and warning you of puni&s;hments that
were to follow? If his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t
you is already begun to be te&s;tified, can
you tell where it is to &s;top, or how long it
may continue to pur&s;ue you throughtout
future &s;tages of your exi&s;tence? <HI>Who
knoweth the power of his wrath?</HI>&mdash;To
this awful, this warning voice, will you
not be per&s;uaded reverently to li&s;ten? Im|pre&s;&s;ed
by the dread authority which it
carries, &s;hall you not fall down on your
knees before your Maker, imploring his
mercy to pardon your pa&s;t offences, and
his grace to rectify your future way?</P>
<P>SUCH ought to be the effects of the
con&s;ideration of God as the Governor of
<PB N="132" REF="141">
the world. It leads to thoughts of a ve|ry
&s;erious nature. When we <HI>regard the
work of the Lord,</HI> and contemplate him
as the Author of the univer&s;e, &s;uch con|templation
prompts devotion. But when
we <HI>con&s;ider the operation of his hands</HI> in
providence, and contemplate him as the
Governor of mankind, &s;uch contempla|tion
prompts humiliation before him for
offences committed. The former ad|dre&s;&s;es
it&s;elf to the ingenuous &s;entiments
that are left in the heart; and awakens a
&s;en&s;e of our unworthine&s;s, in neglecting
the Author of nature, amid&s;t our riotous
plea&s;ures. The latter adder&s;&s;es it&s;elf to
our regard for &s;afety and happine&s;s; and
awakens fear and dread, from con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
of the guilt we have contracted.
Hence &s;prings up in every thoughtful
mind, an anxious concern to avert the
di&s;plea&s;ure, and regain the favour of that
Supreme Being to whom we are all
&s;ubject. This, among unenlightened na|tions,
gave ri&s;e to &s;acrifices, expiations,
and all the rites of humble, though &s;upper|&s;titious
<PB N="133" REF="142">
wor&s;hip. Among nations, who
have been in&s;tructed in true religion, &s;en|timents
of the &s;ame nature pave the way
for prayer, repentance, faith, and all tho&s;e
duties, by means of which we may hope,
through a divine Mediator and Interce&s;|&s;or,
to be reconciled to heaven. Natural
and revealed religion here appear in con|cord.
We behold the original dictates of
the human heart laying a foundation for
the glad reception of the comfortable tid|ings
of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus endeavoured to &s;how in
what manner, by <HI>regarding the work of the
Lord, and con&s;idering the operation of his
hands,</HI> we may prevent the dangers ari&s;|ing
from a thoughtle&s;s indulgence of
plea&s;ure; we may be furni&s;hed with an
antidote to the poi&s;on which is too often
mixed in that intoxicating cup.&mdash;Human
life is full of troubles. We are all tempt|ed
to alleviate them as much as we can,
by freely enjoying the plea&s;urable mo|ments
which Providence thinks fit to al|low
<PB N="134" REF="143">
low us. Enjoy them we may: But, if
we would enjoy them &s;afely, and enjoy
them long, let us temper them with the
fear of God. As &s;oon as this is forgotten
and obliterated, the &s;ound of <HI>the harp
and the viol</HI> is changed into the &s;ignal of
death. The &s;erpent comes forth from
the ro&s;es where it had lain in ambu&s;h,
and gives the fatal &s;ting. Plea&s;ure in
moderation is the cordial, in exce&s;s it is

<P>I. <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life.</HI>
This plainly imports that there are dif|ferent
<HI>paths</HI> or cour&s;es of conduct, which
may be pur&s;ued by men in this world;
a path which leads to li&s;e or happine&s;$,
and a path which i&s;&s;ues in death or de|&s;truction.
The&s;e oppo&s;ite lines of con|duct
are determined by the choice which
men make of virtue or of vice; and hence
men are divided into two great cla&s;&s;es,
according as their inclinations lead them
to good or to evil. <HI>The path of life</HI> is of|ten
a rough and difficult path, followed
<PB N="138" REF="147">
only by a few. The oppo&s;ite one is the
broad way, in which the multitude walk;
&s;eemingly &s;mooth, and &s;trewed with flow|ers;
but leading in the end to death and
mi&s;ery. <HI>The path of life</HI> conducts us up a
&s;teep a&s;cent. The palace of virtue has, in
all ages, been repre&s;ented as placed on the
&s;ummit of a hill; in the a&s;cent of which
labour is requi&s;ite, and difficulties are to
be &s;urmounted; and where a conductor
is needed, to direct our way, and to aid
our &s;teps.</P>
<P>Now, the hope which good men en|tertian
is, that this <HI>path of life</HI> &s;hall be
&s;hewn them by God; that, when their
intentions are upright, God will both in|&s;truct
them concerning the road which
leads to true happine&s;s, and will a&s;&s;i&s;t
them to pur&s;ue it &s;ucce&s;&s;fully. Among
nations where any &s;uitable ideas of God
or of virtue began to be formed, hopes
of this nature al&s;o began to be entertain|ed.
It was con&s;onant to the nature of
man, to think that the Supreme Being
was favourable to virtue. Accordingly,
<PB N="139" REF="148">
in the writings of &s;ome of the ancient phi|lo&s;ophers,
we find various ob&s;cure traces
of this belief, that there was a benign hea|venly
&s;pirit, who illuminated the minds
of the virtuous, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted their endea|vours
to obtain wi&s;dom and happine&s;s.
They even a&s;&s;erted, that no man became
great or good without &s;ome in&s;piration of
heaven.</P>
<P>But what they indi&s;tinctly conceived,
and could not with confidence rely upon,
the doctrine of Chri&s;tianity hath clearly
explained and fully confirmed; expre&s;s|ly
and frequently teaching that, not only
by the external di&s;coveries of revelation,
but by the inward operations of his Spi|rit,
he <HI>shows</HI> to the humble and virtu|ous
the <HI>path of life.</HI> While, by his word,
he in&s;tructs them in their duty, by
the influence of his grace he a&s;&s;i&s;ts them
in the performance of it. In all revela|tion
there is certainly no doctrine more
comfortable than this. It is to good men
a noble and plea&s;ing thought, that they
are pur&s;uing a path which God has di&s;|covered
<PB N="140" REF="149">
covered and pointed out to them. For
they know that every path, in which he
is their conductor, mu&s;t be honourable,
mu&s;t be &s;afe, mu&s;t bring them in the end
to felicity. They follow that <HI>Shepherd
of I&s;rael,</HI> who always leads his &s;hock into
<HI>green pa&s;tures, and makes them lie down be|&s;ide
the &s;till waters.</HI> At the &s;ame time,
they know that, if there be truth in re|ligion
at all, on this principle they may
&s;ecurely re&s;t, that the Divine Being will
never de&s;ert tho&s;e who are endeavouring
to follow out, as they can, the path which
he has &s;hewn them. He beholds them
here in a &s;tate of great imbecility; sur|rounded
with much darken&s;s; expo&s;ed to
numberle&s;s dangers, from the temptations
that a&s;&s;ault them without, and the &s;educ|tion
of mi&s;guided and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions
within. In this &s;ituation, can they ever
&s;u&s;pect that the Father of mercies will
leave his &s;ervants, alone and unbefriended,
to &s;truggle up the hill of virtue, without
&s;tretching forth a compa&s;&s;ionate arm to aid
their frailty, and to guide them through
<PB N="141" REF="150">
the bewildering paths of life? Where were
then the <HI>God of love?</HI> Where, tho&s;e in&s;i|nite
compa&s;&s;ions of his nature, in which
all his wor&s;hippers have been encouraged
to tru&s;t?&mdash;No: He will <HI>&s;end forth his
light and his truth to bring them to his holy
hill.</HI> For <HI>the righteous Lord loveth right|eou&s;ne&s;s,
and his countenance beholdeth the
upright.</HI> With him there is no oblique
purpo&s;e, to turn him a&s;ide, from favouring
the cau&s;e of goodne&s;s. No undertaking
to which he has given his countenance
&s;hall prove abortive. No promi&s;e that he
has made &s;hall be allowed to fail. Whom
he loveth, he loveth to the end. The &s;ecret
of the Lord is with them that fear him, and
he will &s;hew them his covenant. The meek
will be guide in judgement, and them will
be teach his way. His grace &s;hall be &s;uf|ficient
for them, and his &s;trength be made
perfect in their weaken&s;s. They go from
&s;trength to &s;trength; every one of them ap|peareth
before God in Zion<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xxv. 14, 9. 2 Cor. xii. 9. P&s;al. lxxxiv. 7.</NOTE>&mdash;Such are
the
<PB N="142" REF="151">
the hopes with which good men in a pre|&s;ent
life &s;et forth on a cour&s;e of piety and
virtue. <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of
life.</HI> Le us now proceed,</P>
<P>II. To con&s;ider the termination of the&s;e
hopes in a future &s;tate. <HI>In thy pre&s;ence is
fulne&s;s of joy; at thy right hand there are
plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI> All happine&s;s af|&s;uredly
dwells with God. The <HI>fountain
of life</HI> is ju&s;tly &s;aid to be <HI>with him.</HI> That
&s;upreme and independent Being mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily
po&s;&s;e&s;s within him&s;elf every prin|ciple
of beatitude; and no cau&s;e from
without can po&s;&s;ibly affect his untroubled
felicity. Among created dependent be|ings,
happine&s;s flows in &s;cattered and fee|ble
&s;treams; &s;treams that are often tinged
with the blacken&s;s of mi&s;ery. But from
before the throne of God i&s;&s;ues the river
of life, full, unmixed, and pure; and the
plea&s;ures which now in &s;canty portions
we are permitted to ta&s;te, are all derived
from that &s;ource. Whatever gladdens
<PB N="143" REF="152">
the hearts of men or angels, with any real
and &s;atisfactory joy, comes from heaven.
It is a portion of the <HI>pure influence flow|ing
from the glory of the Almighty;</HI> a ray
<HI>i&s;&s;uing from the brightne&s;s of the everla&s;ting
life.</HI> It is manife&s;t, therefore, that every
approach to God mu&s;t be an approach to
felicity. The enjoyment of his imme|diate
pre&s;ence mu&s;t be the con&s;umma|tion
of felicity; and it is to this pre&s;ence
that the P&s;almi&s;t here expre&s;&s;es his hope
that the <HI>path of life</HI> was to conduct him.</P>
<P>The whole of what is implied in ar|riving
at the pre&s;ence of the Divinity, we
cannot expect to comprehend. Such ex|pre&s;&s;ions
as the&s;e of &s;cripture, <HI>beholding
the face of God; being made glad with the
light of his countenance, and &s;atisfied with
his likene&s;s; &s;eeing light in his light; &s;eeing
no longer darkly as through a gla&s;s, but face
to face; &s;eeing him as he is;</HI> are expre&s;&s;ions
altogether my&s;terious, conveying &s;ublime
though ob&s;cure ideas of the mo&s;t perfect
happine&s;s and highe&s;t exaltation of human
nature. This we know, that the ab&s;ence
<PB N="144" REF="153">
of God, the di&s;tance at which we are now
placed from any communication with our
Creator, is one great &s;ource of our infeli|city.
Faith exerts its endeavours, but of|ten
ineffectually, to rai&s;e our &s;ouls to him.
He is a <HI>God that hideth him&s;elf.</HI> His ways
&s;eem intricate and
perplexed. We fre|quently
cannot reconcile them to the con|ceptions
which we had formed of his na|ture;
and with many a &s;u&s;picion and
doubt they perplex the inquiring mind.
His works we &s;urvey with a&s;toni&s;hment.
We wonder and adore. But while we
clearly trace the foot&s;teps of their great
Author, his pre&s;ence we can never di&s;|cern.
<HI>We go forward, but he is not there;
and backward, but we cannot perceive him:
on the left hand, where he worketh, but we
cannot behold him: he hideth him&s;elf on the
right hand, that we cannot &s;ee him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxiii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. Hence
amid&s;t the various &s;orrows and di&s;cou|ragements
of the pre&s;ent &s;tate, that excla|mation
<PB N="145" REF="154">
of Job's is often drawn forth from
the pious heart, <HI>O that I knew where I
might find him, that I might come even to his

<P>Surrounded by &s;uch di&s;tre&s;&s;ing ob&s;cu|rity,
no hope more tran&s;porting can be
opened to a good man, than that a period
is to come, when he &s;hall be allowed to
draw nearer to the Author of his exi&s;t|ence,
and to enjoy the &s;en&s;e of his pre&s;ence.
In order to convey &s;ome faint idea of that
future bli&s;s, by &s;uch an image as we can
now employ, let the image be taken from
the mo&s;t glorious repre&s;entative of the Su|preme
Being, with which we are acquaint|ed
in this world, the Sun in the heavens. As
that re&s;plendent luminary chears and re|vives
the univer&s;e, when, after the dark|ne&s;s
of a tempe&s;tuous night, it comes
forth in the morning with its brighte&s;t
lu&s;tre, and in&s;pires every heart with glad|ne&s;s;
as a&s;cending gradually through the
heavens, it converts that whole va&s;t ex|tent,
<PB N="146" REF="155">
over which its beams are diffu&s;ed,
into a region of light; and thus changes
entirely the &s;tate of objects, by arraying
all nature in beauty, and transforming it
into the image of its own brightne&s;s:&mdash;Some
&s;uch change as this, though in a de|gree
infinitely &s;uperior, we may conceive
the revelation of the Divine I re&s;ence to
produce upon the human &s;oul. <HI>I will
behold thy face in righteous&s;ne&s;s; I &s;hall be
&s;atisfied, when I awake, with thy likene&s;s:</HI>&mdash;But
without endeavouring farther to un|fold
my&s;teries which we cannot explore,
there are two &s;ublime and expre&s;&s;ive views
of the Divine E&s;&s;ence given us in &s;crip|ture,
on which it may be edifying that
our thoughts &s;hould re&s;t for a little, in or|der
to aid our conceptions of the ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s
of good men hereafter, in the pre|&s;ence
of God. It is &s;aid, <HI>God is light</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 5.</NOTE>
<HI>God is love</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8.</NOTE>. Let us con&s;ider what <HI>&s;ul|ne&s;s
of joy</HI> mu&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch mani|fe&s;tations
<PB N="147" REF="156">
fe&s;tations of the Divine E&s;&s;ence to the ble&s;|&s;ed.</P>
<P><HI>God is light.</HI> The revelation of his pre|&s;ence,
infers of cour&s;e, a complete diffu|&s;ion
of light and knowledge among all
who partake of that pre&s;ence. This un|que&s;tionably
forms a primary ingredient
of happine&s;s. Ignorance, or the want of
light, is the &s;ource of all our pre&s;ent mi&s;|conduct,
and all our misfortunes. The heart
of man is dark; and in the dark|ne&s;s
of his heart is the &s;$at of his corrup|tion.
He is unable to di&s;cern what is
truly good. Perpetually employed in
&s;earch of happine&s;s, he is perpetually mi&s;|led
by fal&s;e appearances of it. The er|rors
of his under&s;tanding impo&s;e upon
his pa&s;&s;ions; and, in con&s;equence of the
wrong direction which his pa&s;&s;ions take,
he is betrayed into a thou&s;and di&s;orders.
Hence &s;en&s;uality, covetou&s;ne&s;s, and all the
violent conte&s;ts with others about trifles,
which occa&s;ion &s;o much mi&s;ery, and &s;o
many crimes in the world. <HI>He feedeth of
<PB N="148" REF="157">
a&s;hes: a deceived heart hath turned him
a&s;ide, that he cannot deliver his &s;oul, nor &s;ay,
Is there not a lie in my right hand</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah xliv. 20.</NOTE>?&mdash;Once
open to him the perfect &s;ources of
knowledge and truth; &s;uppo&s;e him pla|ced
in the pre&s;ence of that God who is
<HI>Light;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e him illuminated by light
derived immediately from the Supreme
Being; pre&s;ently all his former errors
would fla away, as mi&s;ts are di&s;pelled by
the ri&s;ing &s;un. His whole nature would
be changed and reformed. The prejudices
which ob&s;cured his under&s;tanding would
be removed. The &s;eductions of his pa&s;&s;ions
would di&s;appear. Rectitude and virtue,
having nothing now to ob&s;truct their en|trance,
would take entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his
heart. Angels are happier than men, be|cau&s;e
they enjoy more enlarged knowledge
and views; becau&s;e they labour under none
of our unhappy deceptions; but &s;ee the
truth as it is in it&s;elf; &s;ee it, as it is in
<PB N="149" REF="158">
God. Sharing the &s;ame light, which il|luminates
them, good men in a future
&s;tate will &s;hare in their felicity.</P>
<P>Moreover, the light that flows from the
pre&s;ence of Him who is the original
&s;ource of light not only bani&s;hes mi&s;eries
which were the effects of former darkne&s;s,
but al&s;o confers the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite enjoy|ment.
The knowledge afforded us at
pre&s;ent &s;erves to &s;upply our mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
wants; but it does no more. It is al|ways
imperfect and un&s;atisfactory; nay,
much painful anxiety it often leaves. Nar|row
is the &s;phere within which the mind
can &s;ee at all; and even there it can &s;ee
only <HI>darkly as through a gla&s;s.</HI> But when
it &s;hall be enlarged beyond this du&s;ky
territory, let loo&s;e from his earthly pri|&s;on,
and in <HI>God's light</HI> permitted to <HI>&s;ee
light,</HI> the mo&s;t magnificent and glorious
&s;pectacles must open to the view of the
purified &s;pirit. What mu&s;t it be to be|hold
the whole &s;tupendous &s;cene of na|ture
unveiled, and its hidden my&s;teries
di&s;clo&s;ed! To trace the wi&s;e and ju&s;t go|vernment
<PB N="150" REF="159">
of the Almighty, through all
tho&s;e intricacies which had &s;o long per|plexed
us! To behold his hand conduct|ing
ten thou&s;and worlds, which are now
unknown to us; and throughout all the
regions of boundle&s;s &s;pace, to view wi&s;|dom
and goodne&s;s perpetually acting, and
diver&s;ifying its operations in forms of
endle&s;s variety! Well may &s;uch di&s;cove|ries
in&s;pire that &s;ong of the ble&s;&s;ed, which
the apo&s;tle John heard <HI>as the voice of many
waters, and as the voice of mighty thunder|ings,
&s;aying, Alleluiah! For the Lord God
omnipotent reigneth. Great and marvellous
are thy works, Lord God Almighty; ju&s;t
and true are thy ways, thou King of &s;aints</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rev. xix. 6. xv. 3.</NOTE>!
As <HI>God is Light,</HI> &s;o al&s;o it is &s;aid in &s;crip|ture,</P>
<P><HI>God is Love.</HI> His pre&s;ence mu&s;t of
cour&s;e diffu&s;e love, among all who are per|mitted
to dwell in it. <HI>He that loveth
<PB N="151" REF="160">
not, knoweth not God. He that dwelleth
in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 John iv. 8, 16.</NOTE>.
Were man a &s;ingle, &s;olitary being, the
full enjoyment of light might &s;uffice for
his happine&s;s; as the perfection of know|ledge
would rectify and improve to the
highe&s;t all his faculties. But, both here
and hereafter, he is connected with other
beings. Heaven implies a &s;ociety; and
the felicity of that &s;ociety is con&s;tituted
by the perfection of love and goodne&s;s,
flowing from the pre&s;ence of the God of
love.</P>
<P>Hence follows the entire purification of
human nature from all tho&s;e malevolent
pa&s;&s;ions, which have &s;o long rendered our
abode on earth the abode of mi&s;ery. We
greatly deceive our&s;elves, when we charge
our chief di&s;tre&s;&s;es merely to the account
of our external condition in the world.
From the di&s;advantages attending it, I ad|mit,
that we may often have been expo&s;ed
<PB N="152" REF="161">
to &s;uffer. We may have met with di&s;|appointments
in our pur&s;uits. By the
arrows of misfortune we may have
been wounded. Under infirmities of
body we may have langui&s;hed. But on
this we may depend, that the wor&s;t evils
of our pre&s;ent condition ari&s;e from the
want of goodne&s;s and love; from the di&s;|orders
of &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions; from the irrita|tion
which the&s;e occa&s;ion when working
within our&s;elves, and the di&s;tre&s;s which
they produce when breaking out upon
us from others; in a word, from that
corrupted &s;tate of temper, and that reci|procation
of jealou&s;ies, &s;u&s;picions, and in|juries,
which is ever taking place among
the &s;ocieties of men. Could you bani&s;h
di&s;tru&s;t, craft, and uncharitablene&s;s, from
the earth, and form all mankind into an
a&s;&s;embly of the ju&s;t and the benevolent;
could you in&s;pire every heart with kind
affections, and render every one friendly
and generous to his neighbour; you would
bani&s;h at once the mo&s;t afflictive tribe of
human evils. Seldom would the voice of
<PB N="153" REF="162">
complaint be heard. All nature would
a&s;&s;ume a different a&s;pect. Cheerfulne&s;s
would be &s;een on every countenance. Pa|radi&s;e
would return. The wilderne&s;s
would &s;mile; <HI>the de&s;art rejoice and blo&s;&s;om
as the ro&s;e.</HI>&mdash;Now &s;uch are the effects
which the pre&s;ence of the God of love
mu&s;t produce on the inhabitants above.
<HI>Beholding his glory, they are changed into
the &s;ame image.</HI> In that temple of eternal
love, which his pre&s;ence has hallowed and
con&s;ecrated, no &s;ound but the voice of
harmony is ever heard; no appearances
ever pre&s;ent them&s;elves but tho&s;e of peace
and joy.</P>
<P>THUS, con&s;idering God under the&s;e two
illu&s;trious characters which are given of
him in &s;cripture, as <HI>Light,</HI> and as <HI>Love,</HI> it
follows that in his pre&s;ence there mu&s;t be
<HI>fulne&s;s of joy.</HI> But I am far from &s;aying that
the few imperfect hints I have now given,
exhau&s;t, or even approach to, the &s;um of
tho&s;e <HI>plea&s;ures for evermore which are at
God's right hand.</HI> Ten thou&s;and plea|&s;ures
<PB N="154" REF="163">
are there, which now we have nie|ther
faculties to comprehend, nor powers
to enjoy. Behind that my&s;terious cloud,
which covers the habitation of eternity,
the view of mortals cannot penetrate.
Content with our humble and di&s;tant &s;i|tuation,
we mu&s;t as yet remain. Faith
can only look to tho&s;e glories from afar.
In patient &s;ilence, it mu&s;t wait, tru&s;t, and
adore.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing the ideas which I have &s;et
before you, in this di&s;cour&s;e, to be no
more than the &s;peculations of contem|plative
mind, &s;uch as were wont of old
to be indulged by the philo&s;ophers of the
Platonic &s;chool, &s;till they would de&s;erve
attention, on account of their tendency to
purify and elevate the mind. But when
they are con&s;idered in connection with a
revelation, which, upon grounds the mo&s;t
unque&s;tionable, we believe to be divine,
they are entitled to command, not atten|tion
only, but reverence and faith.&mdash;They
pre&s;ent to us &s;uch high expectations as
are &s;ufficient to determine every rea&s;on|able
<PB N="155" REF="164">
man to the choice of virtue; to &s;up|port
him under all its pre&s;ent di&s;courage|ments,
and to comfort him in the hour of
death. Ju&s;tly may they excite in our
hearts that ardent a&s;piration of the P&s;al|mi&s;t:
<HI>My &s;oul thir&s;teth for God, for the
living God; O when &s;$all I come and ap|pear
before him!</HI>&mdash;But, with this wi&s;h in
our hearts, never, I be&s;eech you, let us
forget what was &s;et forth in the fir&s;t part of
this di&s;cour&s;e; that, in order to arrive at
the pre&s;ence of God, the <HI>path of life</HI> mu&s;t
previou&s;ly be &s;hewn to us by him, and
that in this path we mu&s;t per&s;evere to the
end. The&s;e two things cannot be di&s;|joined,
a virtuous life and a happy eter|nity.
<HI>Who &s;hall a&s;cend unto the hill of the
Lord? and who &s;hall &s;tand in his holy
place? He only who hath clean hands and
a pure heart.</HI> Between a corrupted heart
and the God of light and love, there
never can be any connection. But of
this we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the path of
piety and virtue, pur&s;ued with a firm and
<PB N="156" REF="165">
con&s;tant &s;pirit, will, in the end, through
the merits of our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, bring
us to that pre&s;ence, where is <HI>fulne&s;s of
joy, and where are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI></P>

curio&s;ity, by a &s;evere reply; <HI>What is that
<PB N="159" REF="168">
to thee?</HI> &startq; What is it to thee what <HI>this
man &s;hall do;</HI> what &s;hall be his rank; or
what the circum&s;tances of his life or his
death? Attend thou to thine own duty.
Mind thy proper concerns. Fulfil the
part which I have allotted to thee. <HI>Fol|low
thou me.</HI> &endq;&mdash;The in&s;truction which
ari&s;es from this conver&s;ation of our Lord's
with Peter, is, That all prying inqui|ries
into the &s;tate, circum&s;tances, or cha|racter
of others, are reprehen&s;ible and im|proper;
that to every man a particular
charge is a&s;&s;igned by his Lord and Ma&s;|ter,
the fulfillment of which ought to be
the primary object of his attention, without
officiou&s;ly thru&s;ting him&s;elf into the con|cerns
of others. The illu&s;tration of the&s;e
points &s;hall make the &s;ubject of the pre&s;ent
di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT idle curio&s;ity that inqui&s;itive
and meddling &s;pirit, which leads men to
pry into the affairs of their neighbours,
is reprehen&s;ible on three accounts. It in|terrupts
the good order, and breaks the
<PB N="160" REF="169">
peace of &s;ociety. It brings forward and
nouri&s;hes &s;everal bad pa&s;&s;ions. It draws
men a&s;ide from a proper attention to the
di&s;charge of their own duty.</P>
<P>IT interrupts, I &s;ay, the order, and
breaks the peace of &s;ociety. In this world
we are linked together by many ties. We
are bound by duty, and we are prompted
by intere&s;t, to give mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
to perform friendly offices to each other.
But tho&s;e friendly offices are performed
the mo&s;t advantage, when we avoid to in|terfere
unnece&s;&s;arily in the concerns of
our neighbour. Every man has his own
part to act, has his own intere&s;t to con&s;ult,
has affairs of his own to manage, which
his neighbour has no call to &s;crutinize.
Human life then proceeds in its mo&s;t na|tural
and orderly train, when every one
keeps within the bounds of his proper
province; when, as long as his pur&s;uits
are fair and lawful, he is allowed, with|out
di&s;turbance, to conduct them in his
own way. <HI>That ye &s;tudy to be quiet, and
<PB N="161" REF="170">
to do your own bu&s;ine&s;s</HI>*<NOTE N="$" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. iv. 11.</NOTE>, is the apo&s;toli|cal
rule, and indeed the great rule, for
pre&s;ervation of harmony and order. But
&s;o it is, that, in every age, a &s;et of men
have exi&s;ted, who, driven by an unhappy
activity of &s;pirit, oftener perhaps than by
any &s;ettled de&s;ign of doing ill, or any mo|tives
of ambition or intere&s;t, love to in|termeddle
where they have no concern,
to inquire into the private affairs of others,
and from the imperfect information which
they collect, to form conclu&s;ions concern|ing
their circum&s;tances and character.
The&s;e are they who, in &s;cripture, are cha|racteri&s;ed
as <HI>tatlers, and bu&s;y bodies in other
mens matters,</HI> and from whom we are cal|led
to <HI>turn away.</HI></P>
<P>Though per&s;ons of this de&s;cription
&s;hould be prompted by nothing but vain
curio&s;ity, they are, neverthele&s;s, dangerous
troublers of the world. While they con|ceive
them&s;elves to be inoffen&s;ive, they are
<PB N="162" REF="171">
&s;owing di&s;&s;en&s;ion and feuds. Cro&s;&s;ing the
lines in which others move, they create
confu&s;ion, and awaken re&s;entment. For
every man conceives him&s;elf to be inju|red,
when he finds another intruding in|to
his affairs, and, without any title, taking
upon him to examine his conduct. Being
improperly and unnece&s;&s;arily di&s;turbed,
he claims the right of di&s;turbing in his
turn tho&s;e who wantonly have troubled
him. Hence, many a friend&s;hip has been
broken; the peace of many a family has
been overthrown; and much bitter and la&s;t|ing
di&s;cord has been propagated through
&s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHILE this &s;pirit of meddling curio|&s;ity
injures &s;o con&s;iderably the peace and
good order of the world, it al&s;o nouri&s;hes,
among individuals who are addicted to it,
a multitude of bad pa&s;&s;ions. Its mo&s;t
frequent &s;ource is mere idlen&s;s, which, in
it&s;elf a vice, never fails to engender many
vices more. The mind of man cannot be
long, without &s;ome food to nouri&s;h the ac|tivity
<PB N="163" REF="172">
of its thoughts. The idle, who have
no nouri&s;hment of this &s;ort within them|&s;elves,
feed their thoughts with inquiries
into the conduct of their neighbours.
The inqui&s;itive and curious are always
talkative. What they learn, or fancy
them&s;elves to have learned, concerning o|thers,
they are generally in ha&s;te to di|vulge.
A tale which the malicious have
invented, and the credulous have pro|pagated;
a rumour which, ari&s;ing among
the multitude, and tran&s;mitted by one to
another, has, in every &s;tep of its progre&s;s,
gained fre&s;h additions&punc; becomes in the
end the foundation of confident a&s;&s;ertion,
and of ra&s;h and &s;evere judgement.</P>
<P>It is often by a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and ri|valry,
that the re&s;earches of &s;uch per&s;ons
are prompted. They wi&s;h to di&s;cover &s;ome|thing
that will bring down their neigh|bour's
character, circum&s;tances, or reputa|tion,
to the level of their own; or that will
flatter them with an opinion of their own
&s;uperiority A &s;ecret malignity lies at
the bottom of their inquiries. It may be
<PB N="164" REF="173">
concealed by an affected &s;how of candour
and impartiality. It may even be veiled
with the appearance of a friendly concern
for the intere&s;ts of others, and with af|fected
apologies for their failings. But
the hidden rancour is ea&s;ily di&s;covered.&mdash;While,
therefore, per&s;ons of this de&s;crip|tion
trouble the peace of &s;ociety, they at
the &s;ame time poi&s;on their own $inds
with malignant pa&s;&s;ions. Their di&s;po&s;i|tion
is entirely the rever&s;e of that amiable
&s;pirit of charity, on which our religion
lays &s;o great a &s;tre&s;s. Charity <HI>covereth
the multitude of &s;ins;</HI> but this prying and
meddling &s;pirit &s;eeks to di&s;cover and di|vulge
them. Charity <HI>thinketh no evil;</HI> but
this temper inclines us always to &s;u&s;pect
the wor&s;t. Charity <HI>rejoiceth not in iniqui|ty;</HI>
this temper triumphs in the di&s;covery
of errors and failings. Charity, like the
fun, brightens every object on which it
&s;hines; a cen&s;orious di&s;po&s;ition ca&s;ts e|very
character into the darke&s;t &s;hade it
will bear.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="174">
IT is to be farther ob&s;erved, that all im|pertinent
curio&s;ity about the affairs of o|thers
tends greatly to ob&s;truct per&s;onal
reformation; as it draws mens thoughts
a&s;ide from what ought to be the chief ob|ject
of attention, the improvement of their
own heart and life. They who are &s;o of|ficiou&s;ly
occupied about their neighbours,
have little lei&s;ure, and le&s;s inclination, to
ob&s;erve their own defects, or to mind their
own duty. From their inqui&s;itive re|&s;earches,
they find, or imagine they find,
in the behaviour of others, an apology
for their own failings: And the favourite
re&s;ult of their inquiries generally is, to re&s;t
&s;atisfied with them&s;elves. They are at
lea&s;t as good, they think, as others around
them. The condemnation which they
pa&s;s on the vices of their neighbours, they
interpret to be a &s;entiment of virtue in
thenm&s;elves. They become tho&s;e hypo|crites
de&s;cribed by our Lord, who &s;ee
clearly <HI>the mote that is in their neighbour's
eye, while they di&s;cern not the beam that is
in their own.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="175">
IN oppo&s;ition to &s;uch a character as this,
the doctrine plainly inculcated by the text
is, that to every man a particular charge
is given by his Lord and Ma&s;ter, a part is
a&s;&s;igned him by Providence to act; that to
this he ought to bend his chief attention;
and, in&s;tead of &s;crutini&s;ing the character
or &s;tate of others, ought to think of him|&s;elf,
and leave them to &s;tand or fall by
their own ma&s;ter. <HI>What &s;hall this man do?</HI>
&s;aid Peter. <HI>What,</HI> replies our Lord, <HI>is that
to thee? Follow thou me.</HI></P>
<P>WHERE per&s;ons po&s;&s;e&s;s any important
&s;tation, di&s;tingui&s;hed rank, in the world,
the application of this doctrine to them is
manife&s;t. It they have any candour, they
cannot refu&s;e to acknowledge that God
and the world have a title to expect from
them a diligent attention to their proper
part in life; and that to wa&s;te their time
in idle inquiries about others, with whom
they have nothing to do, is reprehen&s;ible
and &s;inful. But there are multitudes of
mankind, to whom this appears in a very
<PB N="167" REF="176">
different light. They are humble and pri|vate
men, who are willing to conceive
them&s;elves as of little importance in the
world. Having no exten&s;ive influence,
and no call, as they think, to di&s;tingui&s;h
them&s;elves by active exertions in any
&s;phere, they imagine that they may inno|cently
lead an idle life, and indulge their
curio&s;ity, by canva&s;&s;ing at plea&s;ure the
character and the behaviour of tho&s;e a|round
them. With per&s;ons of this de|&s;cription
every &s;ociety too much abounds.
&mdash;My brethren, no one ought to con&s;ider
him&s;elf as in&s;ignificant in the &s;ight of God.
In our &s;everal &s;tations we are all &s;ent forth
to be labourers in God's vineyard. Every
man has his work allotted, his talent com|mitted
to him; by the due improvement
of which he might, in one way or other,
&s;erve God, promote virtue, and be u&s;e|ful
in the world. <HI>Occupy till I come,</HI> is
the charge given to all Chri&s;tians without
exception. To be entirely unemployed
and idle is the prerogative of no one, in
any rank of life.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="177">
Even that &s;ex, who&s;e ta&s;k is not to
mingle in the labours of public and ac|tive
bu&s;ine&s;s, have their own part a&s;&s;igned
them to act. In the quiet of dome&s;tic
&s;hade, there are a variety of virtues to be
exerci&s;ed, and of important duties to be
di&s;charged. Much depends on them for
the maintenance of private oeconomy and
order, for the education of the young, and
for the relief and comfort of tho&s;e who&s;e
functions engage them in the toils of the
world. Even where no &s;uch female du|ties
occur to be performed, the care of
preparing for future u&s;efulne&s;s, and of at|taining
&s;uch accompli&s;hments as procure
ju&s;t e&s;teem, is laudable. In &s;uch duties
and cares, how far better is time employ|ed,
than in that &s;earch into private con|cerns,
that circulation of rumours, tho&s;e
di&s;cu&s;&s;ions of the conduct, and de&s;cants
on the character of others, which engro&s;s
conver&s;ation &s;o much, and which end,
for the mo&s;t part, in &s;everity of cen&s;ure!</P>
<P>In whatever condition we are placed,
to act always in character &s;hould be our
<PB N="169" REF="178">
con&s;tant rule. He who acts in charac|ter
is above contempt, though his &s;tation
be low. He who acts out of character
is de&s;picable, though his &s;tation be ever
&s;o high. <HI>What is that to thee,</HI> what this
man or that man does? Think of what
thou oughte&s;t to do thy &s;efl; of what is &s;ui|table
to thy character and place; of what
the world has a title to expect from thee.
Every excur&s;ion of vain curio&s;ity about
others, is a &s;ubtraction from that time and
thought which was due to our&s;elves and
due to God. <HI>Having gifts,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle

&s;heweth mercy, with cheerfulne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rom. xii. 6,&mdash;9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the great circle of human affairs
there is room for every one to be bu&s;y
<PB N="170" REF="179">
and well employed in his own province,
without encroaching upon that of others.
It is thy province of &s;uperiors to direct;
of inferiors, to obey; of the learned to be
in&s;tructive; of the ignorant, to be docile;
of the old to be communicative; of the
young to be advi&s;eable and diligent. Art
thou poor? Show thy&s;elf active and in|du&s;trious,
peaceable and contented. Art
thou wealthy? Show thy&s;elf beneficient
and charitable, conde&s;cending and hu|mane.
If thou live&s;t much in the world,
it is the duty to make the light of a good
example &s;hine con&s;picuou&s;ly before others.
If thou live&s;t private and retired, it is thy
bu&s;ine&s;s to improve thine own mind, and
to add, if thou can&s;t do no more, one
faithful &s;ubject to the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom.
There is indeed no man &s;o &s;eque&s;tered
from active life, but within his own nar|row
&s;phere he may find &s;ome opportuni|ties
of doing good; of cultivating friend|&s;hip,
promoting peace, and di&s;charging
many of the&s;e le&s;&s;er offices of humanity
and kindne&s;s, which are within the reach
<PB N="171" REF="180">
of every one, and which we all owe to
one another. In all the various relations
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t among us in life, as hu&s;|band
and wife, ma&s;ter and &s;ervants, pa|rents
and children, relations and friends,
rulers and &s;ubjects, innumerable duties
&s;tand ready to be performed; innumera|ble
calls to virtuous activity pre&s;ent them|&s;elves
on every hand, &s;ufficient to fill up
with advantage and honour the whole
time of man.</P>
<P>THERE is, in particular, one great and
comprehen&s;ive object of attention, which,
in the text, is placed in direct oppo&s;ition to
that idle curio&s;ity reprehended by our
Lord; that is, to follow Chri&s;t. <HI>Follow
thou me.</HI> What this man or that man
does; how he employs his time; what
u&s;e he makes of his talents; how he &s;uc|ceeds
in the world; are matters, concern|ing
which the information we receive can
never be of great importance to ud; of|ten,
is of no importance at all. But how
our Saviour behaved while he was on
<PB N="172" REF="181">
earth, or how, in our &s;ituation, he would
have behaved, are matters of the highe&s;t
moment to every Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The commandment given in the text,
to <HI>follow him,</HI> includes both ob&s;ervance
of his words, and imitation of his exam|ple.
the words of Chri&s;t contain, as we
all know, the &s;tanding rule of our life.
His example exhibits the great model on
which our conduct ought to be formed;
and it is to this that the precept here deliver|ed
directly refers.&mdash;Examples have great
influence on all. But by all human exam|ples,
we are in danger of being occa&s;ion|ally
mi&s;led. We are ever obliged to be on
our guard, le&s;t the admiration of what is
e&s;timable, betray us into a re&s;emblance of
what is blemi&s;hed and faulty. For the
mo&s;t perfect human characters, in the
mid&s;t of their brightne&s;s and beauty&punc; are
always marked with &s;ome of tho&s;e dark
&s;pots which &s;tain the nature of man.
But our Lord po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the virtues of
the greate&s;t and be&s;t men, without par|taking
any of their defects. In him, all
<PB N="173" REF="182">
was light without a &s;hade, and beauty
without a &s;tain.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, his
example is attended with this &s;ingular ad|vantage,
of being more accommodated
than any other to general imitation. It
was di&s;tingui&s;hed by no unnatural au&s;te|rities,
no affected &s;ingularities; but exhi|bits
the plain and &s;imple tenor of all tho&s;e
virtues for which we have mo&s;t frequent
occa&s;ion in ordinary life. In order to
render it of more univer&s;al benefit, our
Lord fixed his re&s;idence in no particular
place; he tied him&s;elf down to no parti|cular
calling or way of living; but gives
us the opportunity of viewing his beha|viour,
in that variety of lights which e|qually
and indifferently regard all man|kind.
His life was divided between the
retired and the active &s;tate. Devotion and
bu&s;ine&s;s equally &s;hared it. In the di&s;|charge
of that high office with which
he was ve&s;ted, we behold the perfect mo|del
of a public character; and we behold
the mo&s;t beautiful example of private life,
when we contemplate him among his di&s;|ciples,
<PB N="174" REF="183">
as a Father in the mid&s;t of his fa|mily.
&mdash;By &s;uch means he has exhibited
before us &s;pecimens of every kind of
virtue; and to all ranks and cla&s;&s;es of
men has afforded a pattern after which
they may copy. Hardly is there any e|mergency
which can occur in life, but
from &s;ome incident in our Saviour's con|duct,
from &s;ome feature di&s;played in his
character, we are enabled to &s;ay to our|&s;elves,
&startq; Thus Chri&s;t would have &s;poken,
thus he would have acted, thus he
would have &s;uffered, if he had been cir|cum&s;tanced
as we are now.&endq;</P>
<P>In&s;tead, therefore, of thinking of thy
neighbours around thee, and of inquiring
how they behave, keep Chri&s;t in thine eye,
and in thy whole conduct follow him.
<HI>Follow him</HI> in his &s;teady and con&s;cientious
di&s;charge of duty, amid&s;t oppo&s;ition from
evil men, and a corrupted world. Follow
him in his patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his Fa|ther's
will, and the calmen&s;s of his &s;pirit
under all trials. Follow him in his acts
of di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, in his com|pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="175" REF="184">
to the unhappy, in his readine&s;s
to oblige, to a&s;&s;i&s;, and to relieve. Imitate
the mildne&s;s and gentlen$&s;s of his man|ners.
Imitate the a&s;&s;ability and conde$$en|&s;ion
which appeared in his behaviour.
Imitate the uncorrupted &s;implicity and
purity which di&s;tingui&s;hed his whole life.</P>
<P>THESE are much worthier and nobler
objects of your attention, than any of tho&s;e
trifling varieties which you can explore
and di&s;cover in the characters of tho&s;e
among whom you live. By lifting your
view to &s;o high a &s;tandard, you will be
pre&s;erved from de&s;cending to tho&s;e futile
and corrupting employments of thought,
which occupy the idle, the vain, and the
malignant. It is incredible, how much
time and attention are thrown away by
men, in examining the affairs of others,
and di&s;cu&s;&s;ing their conduct. Were their
time and attention thrown away only, the
evil would, in &s;ome degree, be le&s;s. But
they are wor&s;e than thrown away; they
are not merely fruitle&s;s, but productive of
<PB N="176" REF="185">
much mi&s;chief. Such a habit of thought
is connected with a thou&s;and vices. It is
the con&s;tant &s;ource of ra&s;h and &s;evere cen|&s;ure.
It ari&s;es from envy and jealou&s;y.
It foments ill nature and pride. It pro|pagates
mi&s;under&s;tanding and di&s;cord. All
tho&s;e evils would be prevented, if the re|proof
which our Lord admini&s;ters in the
text came oftener home, with proper au|thority,
to the reflexion of men: <HI>What is
that to thee?</HI> Each of us have more mate|rial
and important bu&s;ine&s;s of our own to
fulfil. Our ta&s;k is a&s;&s;igned; our part al|lotted.
Did we &s;uitably examine how
that part was performed, we &s;hould be le&s;s
di&s;po&s;ed to bu&s;y our&s;elves about the con|cerns
of others. We would di&s;cover ma|ny
a di&s;order to be corrected at home;
many a weed to be pulled out from our
own grounds; much remaining to be done,
in order to render our&s;elves u&s;eful in this
world, and fit for a world to come.&mdash;Wherefore,
in&s;tead of being critics on
others, let us employ our critici&s;m on
<PB N="177" REF="186">
our&s;elves. Leaving others to be judged
by Him who &s;earcheth the heart&punc; let us
implore his a&s;&s;i&s;tance for enabling us to
act well our own part, and to follow
Chri&s;t.</P>

by a circum&s;tance in his behaviour which appeared

though nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent, is not al|ways
to continue. $word$ time &s;hall come
<PB N="180" REF="189">
when a commentary &s;hall be afforded on
all that is now ob&s;cure; when the veil of
my&s;tery &s;hall be removed; and full &s;a|tisfaction
be given to every rational mind.
<HI>Thou &s;halt know hereafter.</HI> This is the
doctrine which I purpo&s;e to illu&s;trate in
the following di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I. OUR Saviour's words lead us to ob|&s;erve,
that many things in the conduct
of Providence are at pre&s;ent my&s;terious
and unintelligible. The truth of this
ob&s;ervation will not be called in que&s;tion.
It is indeed very readily admitted by all;
and ever &s;ince the beginning of the world
has been the foundation of many a com|plaint,
and of much &s;ceptici&s;m concern|ing
the government of Heaven.&mdash;That
human affairs are not left to roll on ac|cording
to mere chance, and that Provi|dence
interpo&s;es in them to a certain de|gree,
is made evident by various tokens
to every candid mind. But the perplexi|ty
and trouble of the thoughtful inqui|rer
ari&s;es from ob&s;erving that Providence
<PB N="181" REF="190">
appears not to pur&s;ue any regular or con|&s;i&s;tent
plan. An unaccountable mixture
of light and darkne&s;s pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us,
when we attempt to trace the affairs of
the world up to any wi&s;e and righteous
admini&s;tration. We &s;ee ju&s;tice and order
begun; but on many occa&s;ions they &s;eem
to be de&s;erted The ray of light which
we had traced for a while, &s;uddenly for|&s;akes
us; and, where we had looked for
the continuance of order, we meet with
confu&s;ion and di&s;appointment.&mdash;For in|&s;tance;
when we examine the con&s;titu|tion
of the human mind, we di&s;cern evi|dent
marks of its being framed with a
view to favour and reward virtue. Con|&s;cience
is endowed with &s;ignal authori|ty
to check vice. It brings home un|ea&s;ine&s;s
and remor&s;e to the bad; and it
&s;ooths and &s;upports the righteous with
&s;elf-approbation and peace. The ordi|nary
cour&s;e of human things is made to
coincide in &s;ome degree with this con&s;ti|tution
of our nature. The worthy and
the good are, in general, honoured and
<PB N="182" REF="191">
e&s;teemed. <HI>He that walketh uprightly,</HI> is,
for the mo&s;t part, found to <HI>walk &s;urely.</HI>
The chief misfortunes that befal us in life
can be traced to &s;ome vices or follies
which we have committed; and it almo&s;t
never happens but the <HI>&s;inner's own wic|kedne&s;s
is made,</HI> &s;ooner or later, <HI>to reprove
him, and his back&s;lidings to correct him.</HI></P>
<P>All this carries the impre&s;s of a ju&s;t
Providence, of a wi&s;e and a benevolent
admini&s;tration of the univer&s;e. We can|not
avoid perceiving that the Almighty
hath <HI>&s;et his throne for judgement.</HI> At
the &s;ame time, when we pur&s;ue our in|quiries,
the Almighty appears to <HI>hold back
the face of his throne, and to &s;pread his cloud
upon it</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxvi. 9.</NOTE>. For in looking abroad into the
world, how many &s;cenes do we behold,
which are far from corre&s;ponding with
any ideas we could form of the govern|ment
of Heaven? Many nations of the
earth we &s;ee lying in a &s;tate of barbarity
<PB N="183" REF="192">
and mi&s;ery; &s;unk in &s;uch gro&s;s igno|rance
as degrades them below the rank of
rational beings; or abandoned to be the
prey of cruel oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny.
When we look to the &s;tate of individuals
around us, we hear the lamentations of
the unhappy on every hand. We meet with
weeping parents, and mourning friends.
We behold the young cut off in the flower
of their days, and the aged left de&s;olate
in the mid&s;t of &s;orrows. The u&s;eful and
virtuous are &s;wept away, and the worth|le&s;s
left to flouri&s;h. The lives of the be&s;t
men are often filled with di&s;couragements
and di&s;appointed hopes. Merit langui&s;h|es
in neglected &s;olitude; and vanity and
pre&s;umption gain the admiration of the
world. From the &s;courge of calumny,
and from the hand of violence, the inju|red
look up to God as the Avenger of
their cau&s;e; but often they look up in
vain. He is <HI>a God that hideth him&s;elf.</HI>
He dwelleth, as to them, in the &s;ecret
place of darkne&s;s; or, if he dwelleth in
<PB N="184" REF="193">
light, it is in <HI>light to which no man can
approach.</HI> Re&s;ignation may &s;eal up their
lips; but in &s;ilence they drop the tear,
and mourn while they adore.</P>
<P>SUCH, it mu&s;t not be di&s;&s;embled, are
the difficulties which encounter us when
we attempt to trace the pre&s;ent ways of
God. At the &s;ame time, upon reflection,
we may be &s;atisfied that cau&s;es can be a&s;|&s;igned
for things appearing in this un|favourable
light; and that there is no
rea&s;on to be &s;urpri&s;ed at the divine con|duct
being my&s;terious at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The monarchy of the univer&s;e is a great
and complicated &s;y&s;tem. It comprehends
numberle&s;s generations of men, who are
brought forth to act their parts for pur|po&s;es
unknown to us. It includes two
worlds at once; the world that now is,
and which is only a &s;mall portion of
exi&s;tence; and a world that is to come,
which endures for eternity. To us, no
more than the beginnings of things are
vi&s;ible. We &s;ee only &s;ome broken parts
<PB N="185" REF="194">
of a great whole. We trace but a few
links of that chain of being, which,
by &s;ecret connections, binds together
the pre&s;ent and the future Such know|ledge
is afforded us as is &s;ufficient for
&s;upplying the exigencies and wants of
our pre&s;ent &s;tate; but it does no more.
Peeping abroad from a dark corner of the
univer&s;e, we attempt in vain to explore
the coun&s;els that govern the world. It is
an attempt to &s;ound an unfa$homable deep
with a &s;canty line; and with a feeble
wing to a&s;cend above the &s;tars. In any
complicated work, even of human art, it
is found nece&s;&s;ary to be acquainted with
the de&s;ign of the whole, in order to judge
of the fitne&s;s of its parts. In a &s;cheme
&s;o complex as the admini&s;tration of the
world, where all the parts refer to one
another, and where what is &s;een is often
&s;ubordinate to what is invi&s;ible, how is it
po&s;&s;ible but our judgements mu&s;t be of|ten
erroneous, and our complaints ill-founded?
If a pea&s;ant or a cottager be
incapable of judging of the govern|ment
<PB N="186" REF="195">
of a mighty empire, is it &s;urpri&s;ing
that we &s;hould be at a lo&s;s concerning the
conduct of the Almighty towards his crea|tures?
<HI>What I do thou knowe&s;t not now.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, on this argument &s;till more can
be &s;aid for our &s;atisfaction. We are to
ob&s;erve, that complete information re|&s;pecting
the ways of God, not only was
not to be expected here; but, moreover,
that it would have been hurtful, if grant|ed
to us in our pre&s;ent &s;tate. It would
have proved incon&s;i&s;tent with that &s;tate;
with the actions which we have to per|form
in it, and the duties we have to ful|fil.
It would indeed have overthrown
the whole de&s;ign of our being placed
in this world. We are placed here un|der
the trial of our virtue. Ignorance
of the events that are ordained to befal
us, ignorance of the plans and the decrees
of heaven, enter nece&s;&s;arily into a &s;tate
of trial. In order to exerci&s;e both our
intellectual and moral powers, and to car|ry
them forward to improvement, we mu&s;t
<PB N="187" REF="196">
be left to find our way in the mid&s;t of
difficulties and doubts, of hard&s;hips, and
&s;ufferings. We mu&s;t be taught to act our
part with con&s;tancy, though the reward
of our con&s;tancy be di&s;tant. We mu&s;t
learn to bear with patience whatever our
Creator judges proper to lay upon us,
though we &s;ee not the rea&s;on of the hard|&s;hips
he inflicts. If we were let into the
&s;ecret of the whole plan of Providence;
if the ju&s;tice of Heaven were, in every
&s;tep of its procedure, made manife&s;t to
our view, man would no longer be the
creature he now is, nor would his pre&s;ent
&s;tate an&s;wer any purpo&s;e of di&s;cipline or
trial.</P>
<P>My&s;tery and darken&s;s, therefore, mu&s;t
of nece&s;&s;ity now take place in the cour&s;e
of things. Our pre&s;ent &s;tate can be no
other than a &s;tate of twilight or dawn,
where dubious forms &s;hall often pre&s;ent
them&s;elves to us, and where we &s;hall find
our&s;elves in a middle condition between
complete light and total darkne&s;s. Had
we enjoyed no evidence of a ju&s;t Judge
<PB N="188" REF="197">
ruling the earth, and of his providence
interpo&s;ing in our affairs, virtue would
have been altogether deprived of its en|couragement
and &s;upport. Had the evi|dence,
on the other hand, been &s;o &s;trong
as to place the hand of the Almighty con|&s;tantly
before our eyes, the intention of our
pre&s;ent exi&s;tence would have been defeated,
and no trial of virtue have remained. In|&s;tead,
therefore, of complaining of the ob|&s;curity
which at pre&s;ent cover the con|duct
of Providence, we &s;ee that, on the
whole, we have rea&s;on to &s;ubmit and a|dore.</P>
<P>II. THE text &s;ugge&s;ts that, though what
God is doing, or what he intends to do,
we <HI>know not now,</HI> yet there is ground to
believe, that at &s;ome future period we
&s;hall receive information <HI>What I do thou
knowe&s;t not now, but thou &s;halt know here|after.</HI>
The que&s;tion here ari&s;es, what that
<HI>hereafter</HI> is to which we are to look for
the &s;olution of our pre&s;ent doubts?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="198">
IN the fir&s;t place, <HI>hereafter</HI> may, on
&s;ome occa&s;ions, refer to the &s;ub&s;equent
cour&s;e of events in this world. It often
happens that the con&s;equences of things
throw light on the de&s;igns of God. The
hi&s;tory of Providence, in proportion as it
advances, di&s;embroils it&s;elf. Though our
pre&s;ent condition forbids exten&s;ive and
complete information, yet as much is
&s;ometimes allowed to appear as gives us
favourable openings into the righteous and
benevolent coun&s;els of heaven.&mdash;Thus, in
the public affairs of the world, it has been
frequently &s;een, that from the mo&s;t un|promi&s;ing
cau&s;es important and benefi|cent
effects have, in the &s;equel, ari&s;en. In
our own country, at one period, the vio|lent
pa&s;&s;ions of a prince gave beginning to
the Reformation. At another period, ar|bitrary
attempts again&s;t religion and li|berty
occa&s;ioned that happy Revolution
which has formed the aera of national
pro&s;perity. In many in&s;tances, <HI>the wrath
of man</HI> has been made to <HI>prai&s;e God.</HI> Tho&s;e
wars and commotions that &s;hake the mo|ral
<PB N="190" REF="199">
world have an&s;wered &s;imilar purpo&s;es
with tempe&s;ts in the natural world, of
purging the air from noxious vapours, and
re&s;toring it to a temperature more &s;ound
and whole&s;ome. From the mid&s;t of con|fu&s;ion
order has been made to &s;pring, and
from temporary mi&s;chiefs, la&s;ting advan|tages
to ari&s;e.&mdash;In all ca&s;es of this na|ture,
with which &s;acred and civil hi&s;tory
abounds, &s;ecret de&s;igns of heaven wee
going on, which were unfolded in the
end. The wheel was always in motion.
The hand of the clock was advancing with
unperceived progre&s;s, till the moment came
of its &s;triking the appointed hour.</P>
<P>In like manner, with re&s;pect to indivi|duals,
there is often a <HI>hereafter</HI> in the
cour&s;e of their lives, which di&s;clo&s;es and
ju&s;tifies the ways of God. Not to mention
the good effects which misfortunes are
found to produce on the minds of men,
by checking their vices, and correcting
their errors, innumerable exemplifications
can be given, of misfortunes paving their
way to future advancement in the world.
<PB N="191" REF="200">
We are always querulous and impatient
when de&s;igns &s;ucceed not according to
our wi&s;h. Ignorant of what futurity is to
bring forward, occupied with nothing but
the pre&s;ent, we exclaim, Where is God?
Where the &s;ceptre of righteou&s;ne&s;s? <HI>Hath
he forgotten to be gracious?</HI> or doth he in|deed
&s;ee, and is there knowledge in the
Mo&s;t High?&mdash;<HI>God &s;eeth not as man &s;eeth:</HI>
He looketh not merely to what you &s;uf|fer,
but to what the effect of the&s;e &s;uf|ferings
is to be. Con&s;ider only in how
different a light the Patriarch Jo&s;eph would
view the events of his life after he had
&s;een in what they had terminated, from
the light in which he &s;aw them, when led
away by the I&s;hmaelites as a &s;lave, or when
thrown by Potiphar into the Egyptian
pri&s;on. We murmur again&s;t Providence,
ju&s;t as the impetuous youth frets again&s;t
his in&s;tructors and tutors, who are keep|ing
him under a &s;trict, and as he thinks
a needle&s;s, di&s;cipline. He knows not
that, by their in&s;truction and di&s;cipline,
they are laying the foundation of his fu|ture
<PB N="192" REF="201">
fortunes; of the wealth which he is
to acquire, and of the advancement to
which he is to ri&s;e in the world. What
may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to him by his tutors
and in&s;tructors, is equally applicable to
us all under our pre&s;ent &s;tate of educati|on;
<HI>What I do, thou knowe&s;t not now, but
thou &s;halt know hereafter.</HI>&mdash;Regarding,
then, the unknow i&s;&s;ue of all worldly
events in this life, let us never de&s;pair;
let us never think di&s;honourably of the
government of God; but have patience
till his providence accompli&s;h its de&s;igns
in its won way, and at its own time. <HI>Al|though
thou &s;aye&s;t thou &s;halt not &s;ee him, yet
judgement is before him; therefore tru&s;t thou
in him</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxxv. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd place, the expre&s;&s;ion of
<HI>hereafter</HI> in the text mu&s;t be under&s;tood
to refer, in its full extent, not to future
events in this life, but to a &s;ub&s;equent
<PB N="193" REF="202">
&s;tate of being. For this life is no more
than the beginning of the mighty and
exten&s;ive plans of Providence. The &s;eeds
are only now &s;own, of what is to ripen
and come forth, at the harve&s;t of the
world; when the revolution of the great
moral year &s;hall be fini&s;hed, and the go|vernment
of God &s;hall obtain its full com|pletion.
It is the chief &s;cope of religion
to direct our view to this period; and it
hath often taught us that the knowledge
of the ways of God, then enjoyed by the
ble&s;&s;ed, &s;hall con&s;titute a chief article of
their felicity. <HI>Now we &s;ee through a
gla&s;s darkly; but then face to face. Now
we know in part; but then we &s;hall know
even as we are known. When that which
is perfect is come, then that which is in part
&s;hall be done away. In God's light we &s;hall
&s;ee light</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Cor. xiii. 10, 12. P&s;alm xxxvi. 9.</NOTE>. The rea&s;ons that required ob|&s;curity
to remain for a while on the ways
of God no longer &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The education
<PB N="194" REF="203">
of good men is completed; and the inten|tion
of tho&s;e &s;teps of education, which
once they could not comprehend, now be|comes
apparent&mdash;Why this man was pre|maturely
carried away from the world in
the beginning of a promi&s;ing cour&s;e; why
that de&s;erving family were left overwhelm|ed
with grief and de&s;pair, by the lo&s;s of
one who was their &s;ole benefactor and
&s;upport; why friend&s;hips cemented by
tender ties were &s;uddenly torn a&s;under
by death: The&s;e are inquiries to which
we can now make no reply; and which
throw a dark gloom over the condut of
the Almighty. But the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t
above, who are admitted to a larger view
of the ways of God, &s;ee the rea&s;ons of
&s;uch coun&s;els. They &s;ee that one man
was &s;ea&s;onably taken away from dangers
and evils to come, which, unknow to
him, were hovering over his head. They
&s;ee that Providence was in &s;ecret prepa|ring
unexpected ble&s;&s;ings for the family
who appeared to be left di&s;con&s;olate and
hopele&s;s. They &s;ee that it was time for
<PB N="195" REF="204">
friend&s;hips to be di&s;&s;olved, when their
longer continuance would to &s;ome of the
parties have proved a &s;nare. Where we
behold nothing but the rod of power
&s;tretched forth, they di&s;cern an interpo&s;i|tion
of the hand of mercy.</P>
<P>Let us wait till this promi&s;ed <HI>hereafter</HI>
arrive, and we &s;hall in like manner be &s;a|tisfied
concerning the events that now
di&s;turb and perplex us. We &s;hall then
know why &s;o much darken&s;s and mi&s;ery
have been &s;o long permitted to reamain on
the earth, and &s;o much opre&s;&s;ion and
tyranny to prevail among the nations.
We &s;hall &s;ee ri&s;ing, as from the a&s;hes

Cau&s;e. I a&s;k him, Whether in the
natural world he di&s;cerns not as many
my&s;terious and puzzling appearances as
are to be found in the moral world?
Are not de&s;tructive &s;torms, burning
mountains, uninhabitable de&s;erts, as dif|ficult
<PB N="198" REF="207">
to be reconciled to his pre-con|conceived
ideas of &s;upreme wi&s;dom and
goodne&s;s in the Creator, as the &s;ufferings
and afflictions which in the cour&s;e of Pro|vidence
befal the ju&s;t? The natural and
moral world are, in this re&s;pect, counter|parts
to one another. Both are marked
with the &s;ame characters, and carry the
imprc&s;s of the &s;ame powerful and gracious
hand. In both, it is evidently the intention
of the fir&s;t Author not to render every
thing level to our capacity; but in the
mid&s;t of high de&s;ign and order, to al|low
certain objects to appear, which con|tradict
the ideas we had formed, and
mock our vain re&s;earches. Now, if we
are obliged to admit that the order
and beauty of the natural world &s;uffici|ently
prove it to be the work of a wi&s;e
Creator, notwith&s;tanding the &s;eeming
deformities which it exhibits; are we

<P>BONDAGE and &s;ubjection are di&s;a|greeable

ideas to the mind. The advo|cates
of vice, taking advantage of tho&s;e
natural impre&s;&s;ions, have in every age
employed them for di&s;crediting religion.
They repre&s;ent it as the bondage and con|finement
<PB N="202" REF="211">
of the free-born &s;oul of man;
as a &s;tate of perpetual con&s;traint, formed
by a &s;y&s;tem of &s;evere rules, which de&s;ign|ing
men have contrived to impo&s;e as fet|ters
on the multitude. On the other hand,
they paint a licentious cour&s;e to them|&s;elves,
and hold it out to the world, as
the gay and plea&s;urable enjoyment of
life; where, having &s;urmounted the pre|judices
of education, and the timorous
&s;cruples of con&s;cience, men can think and
act at plea&s;ure, and give full &s;cope to
every wi&s;h of the heart.&mdash;But what if
tho&s;e pretended &s;ons of freedom be them|&s;elves
held in mi&s;erable &s;ubjection, and
their boa&s;ts of liberty be no more than
the <HI>&s;welling words of vanity?</HI> The Apo&s;tle
a&s;&s;erts in the text, that while they <HI>pr$m$$c
liberty</HI> to others, they are <HI>the &s;ervants,</HI> or
&s;laves, of <HI>corruption, overcome, and brought
into bondage by it.</HI> This a&s;&s;ertion of the
Apo&s;tle I purpo&s;e to illu&s;trate. I &s;hall en|deavour
to make it appear, that no true
liberty can ari&s;e from vice; that bad men
<PB N="203" REF="212">
undergo the wor&s;t &s;ervitude; and that no
one is free, but he who is virtuous and good.</P>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to begin with removing
fal&s;e ideas of liberty, and &s;howing in what
it truly con&s;i&s;ts. We are not to imagine
that to be free imports our being &s;et loo&s;e
from re&s;traint or rule of every kind. No
man, in any condition of life, is at liberty
to act always as he plea&s;es, and to gratify
every wi&s;h he forms. The nature of the
human &s;tate nece&s;&s;arily impo&s;es on all
men various re&s;traints. The laws of &s;o|ciety
allow no one to indulge him&s;elf in
pur&s;uits or plea&s;ures that are injurious to
his neighbour. Even our own nature
limits our plea&s;ures within certain bounds.
All our de&s;ires cannot be gratified toge|ther.
They frequently interfere, and re|quire
him who would indulge one favour|ite
pa&s;&s;ion, to deny him&s;elf in another.
Di&s;tinctions, therefore, mu&s;t be made,
preferences be given, and &s;ome general
regulation of conduct be ob&s;erved, by
every one who con&s;ults his own welfare.
<PB N="204" REF="213">
If there be any regulation which en&s;ures
us of &s;afety and happine&s;s, to be di&s;en|gaged
from the ob&s;ervance of that regu|lation
is no article of liberty; at lea&s;t of
&s;uch liberty as a wi&s;e man would wi&s;h to
enjoy. It is in effect to be turned loo&s;e
to our own ruin. It is &s;uch liberty as a
blind man enjoys, of wandering at ran|dom,
and &s;triking into every devious path,
without a guide to direct his &s;teps, and
&s;ave him from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>That unbounded licentious&s;ne&s;s, there|fore,
which &s;inners prefer to every regu|lation
of conduct, is altogether different
from true freedom. It is in moral beha|viour
the &s;ame as anarchy is in a &s;tate,
where law and order are cxtinct. An|archy,
&s;urely, is no le&s;s incompatible
with true liberty than ab&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m;
and of the two it is hard to &s;ay which is
the lea&s;t eligible, or the mo&s;t mi&s;erable
&s;tate. Liberty by no means &s;uppoes the
ab&s;ence of all government. It only &s;up|po&s;es
that the government under which
we are placed is wi&s;e; and that the re|&s;traints
<PB N="205" REF="214">
to which we voluntarily &s;ubmit
our&s;elves have been contrived for the ge|neral
intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To be free, therefore, imports, in gene|ral,
our being placed in &s;uch circum&s;tan|ces,
that within the bounds of ju&s;tice and
good order, we can act according to our
own deliberate choice, and take &s;uch mea|&s;ures
for our conduct as we have rea&s;on
to believe are conducive to our welfare;
without being ob&s;tructed either by ex|ternal
force, or by violent internal impul&s;e.
This is that happy and dignified &s;tate
which every wi&s;e man earne&s;tly wi&s;hes to
enjoy. The advantages which re&s;ult from
it are chiefly the&s;e three; freedom of choice;
independence of mind; boldne&s;s and &s;e|curity.
In oppo&s;ition to the&s;e di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
characters of liberty, I now pro|ceed
to &s;how that, in the fir&s;t place, vice
deprives bad men of free choice in their
actions; that, in the &s;econd place, it
brings them under a &s;lavi&s;h dependence
on external circum&s;tances; and that, in
the third place, it reduces them to that
<PB N="206" REF="215">
abject, cowardly, and di&s;quieted &s;tate
which is e&s;&s;entially characteri&s;tic of bon|dage.</P>
<P>I. VICE is incon&s;i&s;ten$ with liberty, as it
deprives &s;inners of the power of free choice,
by bringing them under the dominion
of pa&s;&s;ions and habits. Religion and virtue
adder&s;s them&s;elves to rea&s;on. They call
us to look round on every &s;ide; to think
well of the con&s;equences of our actions;
and, before we taken any &s;tep of importance,
to compare the good with the evil that
may en&s;ue from it. He therefore who fol|lows
their dictates, acts the part of a man
who freely con&s;ults, and chu&s;es, for his own
intere&s;t. But vice can make no preten|&s;ions
of this kind. It awaits not the te&s;t of
deliberate compari&s;on and choice; but o|verpowers
us at once by &s;ome &s;triking im|pre&s;&s;ion
of pre&s;ent advantage or enjoyment.
It hurries us with the violence of pa&s;&s;ion;
captivates us by the allurements of plea|&s;ure;
or dazzles us by the glare of riches.
The &s;inner yields to the impul&s;e, merely
<PB N="207" REF="216">
becau&s;e he cannot re&s;i&s;t it. Rea&s;on re|mon&s;trates;
con&s;cience endeavours to
check him; but all in vain. Having once
allowed &s;ome &s;trong pa&s;&s;ion to gain the
a&s;cendant, he has thrown him&s;elf into
the middle of a torrent, again&s;t which he
may &s;ometimes faintly &s;truggle, but the
impetuo&s;ity of the &s;tream bears him along.
In this &s;ituation he is &s;o far from being
free, that he is not ma&s;ter of him&s;elf.
He does not go, but is driven; to&s;&s;ed, a|gitated,
and impelled; pa&s;&s;ive, like a &s;hip
to the violence of the waves.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ions has for a while exerci&s;ed
its tyrannical &s;way, its vehemence may by
degrees &s;ub&s;ide. But when by long in|dulgence,
it has e&s;tabli&s;hed habits of gra|tification,
the &s;inner's bondage becomes
then more confirmed, and more mi&s;erable.
For during the heat of pur&s;uit he is little
capable of reflection. But, when his ar|dour
is abated, and neverthele&s;s, a vitious
habit rooted, he has full lei&s;ure to per|ceive
the heavy yoke he has brought upon
him&s;elf. How many &s;laves do we &s;ee in
<PB N="208" REF="217">
the world to intemperance, and all kinds
of criminal plea&s;ure, merely through the
influence of cu&s;toms which they had al|lowed
to become &s;o inveterate that it was
not in their power to alter them? Are
they not often reduced to a condition &s;o
wretched, that when their licentious plea|&s;ures
have become utterly in&s;ipid, they
are &s;till forced to continue them, &s;olely be|cau&s;e
they cannot refrain; not beacau&s;e
the indulgence gives them plea&s;ure, but
becau&s;e ab&s;tinence would give them pain;
and this too, even when they are obliged
at la&s;t to condemn their habits of life, as
injuring their fortune, impairing their
con&s;titution, or di&s;gracing their charac|ter?
Vice is not of &s;uch a nature that we
can &s;ay to it, <HI>Hitherto &s;halt thou come and
no further.</HI> Having once entered into its
territories, it is not in our power to make
a retreat when we plea&s;e. <HI>He that com|m$$teth
&s;in is the &s;ervant of &s;in.</HI> No man
who has once yielded up the government
of his mind, and given loo&s;e rein to his
de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, can tell how far the&s;e
<PB N="209" REF="218">
may carry him. He may be brought into
&s;uch a de&s;perate &s;tate, that nothing &s;hall
remain for him but to look back with
regret upon the for&s;aken path of inno|cence
and liberty; and, &s;everely con&s;cious
of the thraldom he &s;uffers, to groan under
fetters which he de&s;pairs of throwing of.
<HI>Can the $thiopian change his &s;kin, or the
leopard his &s;pots? then may ye al&s;o do good
who are accu&s;tomed to do evil</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Jeremiah xiii. 23.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Vice confirms its dominion, and ex|tends
it &s;till farther over the &s;oul, by com|pelling
the &s;inner to &s;upport one crime by
means of another. Not only is he en&s;lav|ed
to tho&s;e vices which take their ri&s;e
from his own inclination, but they render
others nece&s;&s;ary, to which, again&s;t his in|clination,
he mu&s;t &s;ubmit; and thereby
&s;trengthen the commanding power of ini|quity
within him. The immoderate love
of plea&s;ure, for in&s;tance, leads him into
expence beyond his fortune. In order to
<PB N="210" REF="219">
&s;upport that expence, he is obliged to
have recour&s;e to low and di&s;honourable
methods of gain, which originally he de|&s;pi&s;ed.
To cover the&s;e, he is forced upon
arts of di&s;&s;imulation and fraud. One in|&s;tance
of fraud obliges him to &s;upport
it by another; till, in the end, there a|ri&s;es
a character of complicated vice; of
luxury &s;hooting forth into ba&s;ene&s;s, di&s;|hone&s;ty,
inju&s;tice, and perhaps cruelty.
It is thus that one favourite pa&s;&s;ion brings
in a tribe of auxiliaries to complete the
dominion of &s;in. Among all our corrupt
pa&s;&s;ions there is a &s;trong and intimate con|nection.
When any one of them is a|dopted
into our family, it never quits us
until it has fathered upon us all its kind|red.
&mdash;By &s;uch means as the&s;e, by the
violence of pa&s;&s;ions, by the power of ha|bits,
and by the connection of one vice
with another, &s;in e&s;tabli&s;hes that &s;ervitude
over the will, which deprives bad men of
all power of free choice in their actions.</P>
<P>II. THE &s;lavery produced by vice ap|pears
<PB N="211" REF="220">
in the dependence under which it
brings the &s;inner, to circum&s;tances of exter|nal
fortune. One of the favourite charac|ters
of liberty, is the independence it be|&s;tows.
He who is truly a freeman is above all
&s;ervile compliances, and abject &s;ubjection.
He is able to re&s;t upon him&s;elf; and while
he regards his &s;uperiors with proper de|ference,
neither deba&s;es him&s;elf by cring|ing
to them, nor is tempted to purcha&s;e
their favour by di&s;honourable means.
But the &s;inner has for$eited every privi|ledge
of this nature. His pa&s;&s;ions and
habits render him an ab&s;olute dependent
on the world, and the world's favour; on
the uncertain goods of fortune, and the
fickle humours of men. For it is by
the&s;e he &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and among the&s;e his
happine&s;s is &s;ought; according as his
pa&s;&s;ions determine him to pur&s;ue plea|&s;ures,
riches, or preferments. Having no
fund within him&s;elf whence to draw enjoy|ment,
his only re&s;ource is in things with|out.
His hopes and fears all hang upon
the world. He partakes in all its vici&s;&s;i|tudes;
and is moved and &s;haken by eve|ry
<PB N="212" REF="221">
wind of fortune. This is to be in the
&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e a &s;lave to the world.</P>
<P>Religion and virtue, on the other
hand, confer on the mind principles of
noble independence. <HI>The upright man is
&s;atisfied from him&s;elf.</HI> He de&s;pi&s;es not the
advantages of fortune; but he centers
not his happine&s;s in them. With a mo|derate
&s;hare of them he can be contented;
and contentment is felicity. Happy in
his own integrity, con&s;cious of the e&s;teem
of good men, repo&s;ing firm tru&s;t in the
providence, and the promi&s;es of God, he
is exempted from &s;ervile dependence on
other things. He can wrap him&s;elf up
in a good con&s;cience, and look forward,
without terror, to the change of the world.
Let all things &s;hift around him as they
plea&s;e, he believes that, by the divine or|dination,
they &s;hall be made <HI>to work to|gether</HI>
in the i&s;&s;ue <HI>for his good:</HI> And
therefore, having much to hope from
God, and little to fear from the world,
he can be ea&s;e in every &s;tate. One who
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es within him&s;elf &s;uch an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="213" REF="222">
of mind, is truly free.&mdash;But &s;hall
I call that man free, who has nothing that
is his own, no property a&s;&s;ured; who&s;e
very heart is not his own, but rendered
the appendage of external things, and the
&s;port of fortune? Is that man free, let
his outward condition be ever &s;o &s;plendid,
whom his imperious pa&s;&s;ions detain at
their call, whom they &s;end forth at their
plea&s;ure, to drudge and toil, and to beg
his only enjoyment from the ca&s;ualties of
the world? Is he free, who mu&s;t flatter
and lie to compa&s;s his ends; who mu&s;t
bear with this man's caprice, and that
man's scorn; mu&s;t profe&s;s friend&s;hip where
he hates, and re&s;pect where he contemns;
who is not at liberty to appear in his own
colours, nor to &s;peak his own &s;entiments;
who dares not be hone&s;t, le&s;t he &s;hould
be poor?&mdash;Believe it, no chains bind
&s;o hard, no fetters are &s;o heavy, as tho&s;e
which fa&s;ten the corrupted heart to this
treacherous world; no dependence is
more contemptible than that under which
the voluptuous, the covetous, or the am|bitious
<PB N="214" REF="223">
man lies to the means of plea&s;ure,
gain, or power. Yet this is the boa&s;ted li|berty,
which vice promi&s;es, as the recom|pence
of &s;etting us free from the &s;alutary
re&s;traints of virtue.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER character of the &s;lave|ry
of vice, is that mean, cowardly, and di&s;|quieted
&s;tate, to which it reduces the &s;inner.
Boldne&s;s and magnanimity have ever been
accounted the native effects of liberty.
He who enjoys it, having nothing to ap|prehend
from oppre&s;&s;ive power, performs
the offices, and enjoys the comforts of
life, with a manly and undi&s;turbed mind,
Hence his behaviour a dignified, and his
&s;entiments are honourable; while he who
is accu&s;tomed to bend under &s;ervile &s;ubjec|tion,
has always been found mean-&s;pirited,
timorous, and ba&s;e.&mdash;Compare, in the&s;e
re&s;pects, the virtuous and the vicious man,
and you will ea&s;ily &s;ee to which of them
the characteri&s;tics of freedom mo&s;t ju&s;tly
belong. The man of virtue, relying on
a good con&s;cience and the protection of
<PB N="215" REF="224">
Heaven, acts with firmne&s;es and courage;
and in the di&s;charge of his duty, fears
not the face of man. The man of vice,
con&s;cious of his low and corrupt aims,
&s;hrinks before the &s;tedfa&s;t and piercing
eye of integrity; is ever looking around
him with anxious and fearful circum&s;|pec|tion,
and thinking of &s;ubterfuges, by
which he may e&s;cape from danger. The
one is <HI>bold as a lion;</HI> the other <HI>flieth when
no man pur&s;ueth.</HI> To the one, nothing ap|pears
contemptible, by which he can pro|cure
any pre&s;ent advantage. The other
looks with di&s;dain on whatever would de|grade
his character. &startq; I will not, &endq; &s;ays
he, &startq; &s;o demean my&s;elf, as to catch the
favour of the greate&s;t man, by this or
that low art. It &s;hall not be &s;aid or
thought of me, that I did what was ba&s;e
in order to make my fortune. Let o|thers
&s;toop &s;o low, who cannot be with|out
the favours of the world. But I
can want them, and therefore at &s;uch a
price I will not purcha&s;e them. &endq; This
<PB N="216" REF="225">
is the voice of true liberty; and &s;peaks
that greatne&s;s of mind which it is formed
to in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Corre&s;ponding to that abject di&s;po&s;ition
which characteri&s;es a bad man, are the
fears that haunt him. The terrors of a
&s;lave dwell on his mind, and often appear
in his behaviour. For guilt is never free
from &s;u&s;picion and alarm. The &s;inner
is afraid, &s;ometimes, of the partners of his
crimes, le&s;t they betray him; &s;ometimes,
of tho&s;e who have &s;uffered by his crimes,
le&s;t they revenge them&s;elves; frequently,
of the world around him, le&s;t it detect
him; and what is wor&s;t of all, he is re|duced
to be afraid of him&s;elf There is
a witne&s;es within him that te&s;tifies again&s;t
his mi&s;deeds; and threatens him in &s;e|cret,
when other alarms leave him. Con|&s;cience
holds up to his view the image of
his pa&s;t crimes, with this in&s;cription en|graved
upon it, &startq; <HI>God will bring every
work into judgement.</HI> &endq; How oppo&s;ite is
&s;uch a &s;tate as this, to the peaceful &s;ecu|rity
ari&s;ing from the liberty enjoyed by
<PB N="217" REF="226">
the virtuous?&mdash;Were there nothing
more in the circum&s;tances of &s;inners to
affix upon them the marks of &s;ervitude,
this alone would be &s;ufficient, that, as the
&s;cripture expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>through fear of death
they are all their lifetime &s;ubject to bondage</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE>.
Death &s;ets all other captives free. The
&s;lave who digs in the mine, or labours
at the oar, can rejoice in the pro&s;pect of
laying down his burden together with
his life; and ta&s;tes the hope of being at
la&s;t on equal terms with his cruel oppre&s;|&s;or.
But to the &s;lave of guilt there ari&s;es
no hope from death. On the contrary,
he is obliged to look forward with con|&s;tant
terror to his mo&s;t certain of all
events, as the conclu&s;ion of all his hopes
and the commencement of his greate&s;t
mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus &s;et before you &s;uch clear
and unequivocal marks of the &s;ervitude
<PB N="218" REF="227">
undergone by &s;inners, as fully verify the
a&s;&s;ertion in the text, that a &s;tate of vice
and corruption is a &s;tate of bondage. In
order to perceive how &s;evere a bondage
it is, let us attend to &s;ome peculiar cir|cum&s;tances
of aggravation which belong to
it.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, It is a bondage to which the mind
it&s;elf, the native &s;eat of liberty, is &s;ubject|ed.
In other ca&s;es, a brave man can
comfort him&s;elf with reflecting that, let
tyrants do their wor&s;t, let pri&s;ons or fet|ters
be his lot, his mind remains uncon|quered
and free. Of this liberty they
cannot rob him; here he moves in a high|er
&s;phere, above the reach of oppre&s;&s;ion or
confinement. But what avails the &s;how
of external liberty, to one who has lo&s;t
the government of him&s;elf? As our Sa|viour
rea&s;ons, in another ca&s;e, <HI>If the light
that is in thee be darkne&s;s, how great is that
darkne&s;s?</HI> So we may rea&s;on here, if that
part of thy nature, thy mind, thy will,
by which only thou can&s;t enjoy and re|li&s;h
liberty, be it&s;elf in bondage to evil
<PB N="219" REF="228">
pa&s;&s;ions and habits, how mi&s;erable mu&s;t
be that bondage?</P>
<P>Next, It is aggravated by this con&s;ide|ration,
that it is a bondage which we have
brought upon our&s;elves. To have been
forced into &s;lavery, is mi&s;fortune and mi|&s;ery.
But to have renounced our liberty
and cho&s;en to be &s;laves, is the greate&s;t re|proach
added to the greate&s;t mi&s;ery. Mo|ments
there frequently mu&s;t be, when a
&s;inner is &s;en&s;ible of the degradation of his
&s;tate; when he feels with pain the &s;lavi&s;h
dependence under which heis is brought to
fortune and the world, to violent pa&s;&s;ions
and &s;ettled habits, and to fears and ap|prehen&s;ions
ari&s;ing from con&s;cious guilt.
In &s;uch moments, how cruel is the reflec|tion,
that of all this di&s;grace and mi&s;ery
he has been the author to him&s;elf; that
by voluntary compliance, he has given to
his pa&s;&s;ions that haughty a&s;cendant which
they now exerci&s;e over him; has forged

La&s;tly, The &s;ervitude of vice is accom|panied
with this farther aggravation, that
it is &s;ubjection to our own &s;ervants. Tho&s;e
de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, which the &s;inner has
rai&s;ed to lawle&s;s rule, were given us as
in&s;truments of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation; but were
plainly de&s;igned to be under the direction
of a higher power. Of them&s;elves, they
are head&s;trong and blind; they bear all
the marks of intended &s;ubordination; and
con&s;cience is inve&s;ted with every en|&s;ign
of authority and &s;upremacy. But
&s;in inverts the whole frame of human na|ture.
It compels rea&s;on to bow down
before tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it was formed
to command; and leads it, as it were in
triumph, to grace the &s;hameful conque&s;t
of its mini&s;ters and &s;ervants. It has been
always ob&s;erved that none are &s;o in&s;olent
in power, as they who have u&s;urped an
authority to which they had no right;
and &s;o it is found to hold in this in&s;tance.
The de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions of a vitious man,
having once obtained an unlimited &s;way,
trample him under their feet. They
<PB N="221" REF="230">
make him feel that he is &s;ubject to divers,
and contradictory as well as imperious
ma&s;ters, who often pull him different
ways. His &s;oul is rendered the recep|tacle
of many repugnant and jarring di&s;|po&s;tions;
and re&s;embles &s;ome barbar|ous
country, cantoned out into different
principalities, who are continually waging
war on one another.&mdash;Such is the &s;tate
into which &s;inners have brought them|&s;elves,
in order to be free from the &s;uppo&s;|ed
confinement of virtue. Where they
had promi&s;ed them&s;elves nothing but ea&s;e
and plea&s;ure, they are made to experience
re&s;traints more &s;evere, and mortifications
more painful, than any which they would
have undergone under the di&s;cipline of
religion.</P>
<P>It will perhaps be contended by &s;ome,
that although the repre&s;entation which
has now been given of the &s;lavery of &s;in
holds true in certain in&s;tances, yet that
it is applicable only to tho&s;e who come
under the de&s;cription of atrocious &s;inners.
They imagine that a certain moderate
<PB N="222" REF="231">
cour&s;e may be held in vice, by means of
which, men, without throwing altogether
a&s;ide the re&s;traints of rea&s;on, may enjoy
as ea&s;y and plea&s;urable life.&mdash;By rea|&s;oning
thus, my friends, you flatter and
deceive your&s;elves to your own de&s;truc|tion.
Be a&s;&s;ured, that, by every vitious
indulgence, you are making an approach
to a &s;tate of complete &s;lavery; you are
forfeiting a certain &s;hare of your liber|ty;
how &s;oon the whole of it may be for|feited,
you are not aware. It is true that
all which has now been &s;aid of the &s;ervi|tude
of &s;in, applies only to a character cor|rupted
in the extreme. But, remember
that to this extreme no man ever arrives
at once. He pa&s;&s;es through many of
tho&s;e intermediate &s;tages, in one of which
you are now perhaps found. Vice al|ways
creeps by degrees; and in&s;en&s;ibly
twines around us tho&s;e concealed fetters
by which we are at la&s;t completely bound.
&mdash;As you value therefore your liberty
and your happine&s;s, avoid every approach
to evil. Con&s;ider all vitious plea&s;ures as
<PB N="223" REF="232">
enchanted ground, by entering on which,
you will be farther and farther en&s;nared

an inward principle of goodne&s;s, is be|yond
di&s;ute, and that its value and effi|cacy
are derived from its effects in puri|fying
the heart, and reforming the life.
<PB N="225" REF="234">
All external &s;ervices, which have not this
tendency, are entirely in&s;ignificant. They
degenerate into mere &s;uper&s;tition, equally
unacceptable to God, and unprofitable to
man. Hence they are &s;o often treated in
&s;cripture with high contempt, when &s;ub|&s;tituted
in the room of the important du|ties
of a virtuous life.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, it is certain that
external &s;ervices have their own place,
and a con&s;iderable one too, in the &s;y&s;tem
of religion. What their proper place is no
one can be at a lo&s;s to di&s;cern, who will
only make a ju&s;t di&s;tinction between the
means, and the end, in religion. It is
evident there is danger of mens erring
here, either on one &s;ide or other; and it
is certain that they have erred on both.
After it was ob&s;erved, that mankind were
prone to lay too much weight on the ex|ternal
parts of religion, it began to be
thought, that no weight was to be allowed
to them at all. The time was, when all
religion centered in attending the duties
of the church, and paying veneration to
<PB N="226" REF="235">
whatever was accounted &s;acred. This alon$
&s;anctified the character, and compen&s;ated
every blemi&s;h in moral conduct. From
this extreme, the &s;pirit of the age &s;eems to
be running fa&s;t into the oppo&s;ite extreme, of
holding every thing light that belongs to
public wor&s;hip. But if &s;uper&s;tition be an
evil, and a very great one it undoubtedly
is, irreligion is not a &s;maller evil: And
though the <HI>form of godline&s;s</HI> may often
remain, when <HI>the power</HI> of it is wanting;
yet the <HI>power</HI> cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t where
the <HI>form</HI> is altogether gone.&mdash;The holy
P&s;almi&s;t, who&s;e words are now before us,
di&s;covers much better principles. Ex|pre&s;&s;ing
always the highe&s;t regard for the
laws of God, and the precepts of virtue,
he breathes, at the &s;ame time, a &s;pirit of
pure devotion. Though loaded with the
cares of royalty, and encircled with the
&s;plendor of a court, he thought it well be|came
him to &s;how re&s;pect to the great
Lord of nature; and on many occa&s;ions
expre&s;&s;es, as he does in the text, his de|light
in the public &s;ervice of the temple.
<PB N="227" REF="236">
<HI>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy

I purpo&s;e to &s;how the importance of the
public wor&s;hip of God, and the benefits
re&s;ulting from it. I &s;hall con&s;ider it in
three lights; as it re&s;pects God; as it re|&s;pects
the world; as it re&s;pects our&s;elves.</P>
<P>I. LET us con&s;ider it with re&s;pect to
God. If there exi&s;t a Supreme Being,
the Creator of the world, no con&s;equence
appears more natural and direct than this,
that he ought to be wor&s;hipped by his crea|tures,
with every outward expre&s;&s;ion of
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and honour. We need only
appeal to every man's heart, whether this
be not a principle which carries along
with it its own obligation, that to Him
who is the Fountain of our life, and the
Father of our mercies; to Him who has
rai&s;ed up that beautiful &s;tructure of the
univer&s;e in which we dwell, and where
we are &s;urrounded with &s;o many ble&s;|&s;ings
and comforts; &s;olemn acknowledge|ments
<PB N="228" REF="237">
of gratitude &s;hould be made, prai|&s;es and
prayers &s;hould be offered, and all
&s;uitable marks of dependence on him be ex|pre&s;&s;ed.
&mdash;This obligation extends beyond
the &s;ilent and &s;ecret &s;entiments of our
hearts. Be&s;ides private devotion, it na|turally
leads to a&s;&s;ociations for public wor|&s;hip;
to open and declared profe&s;&s;ions of
re&s;pect for the Deity. Where ble&s;&s;ings
are received in common, jointly to ac|knowledge
them. Sincere gratitude is al|ways
of open and diffu&s;ive nature. It
loves to pour it&s;elf forth; to give free vent
to its emotions; and, before the world,
to acknowledge and honour a Benefactor.</P>
<P>So con&s;onant is this to the natural &s;en|timents
of mankind, that all the nations
of the earth have, as with one con&s;ent,
agreed to in&s;titute &s;ome forms of wor&s;hip;
to hold meetings, at certain times, in ho|nour
of their deities. Survey the &s;ocie|ties
of men in their rude&s;t &s;tate; explore
the African de&s;arts, the wilds of America,
<PB N="229" REF="238">
of the di&s;tant i&s;lands of the ocean; and
you will find that over all the earth &s;ome
religious ceremonies have obtained. You
will every where trace, in one form or o|ther,
the temple, the prie&s;t, and the offer|ing.
The prevalence of the mo&s;t ab&s;urd
&s;uper&s;titions furni&s;hes this te&s;timony to
the truth, that in the hearts of all men
the principle is engraved, of wor&s;hip being
due to that invi&s;ible Power who rules the
world.&mdash;Herein con&s;i&s;ts the great excel|lency
of Chri&s;tian religion, that it hath
in&s;tructed us in the &s;imple and &s;piritual
nature of that wor&s;hip. Di&s;encumbered
of idle and unmeaning ceremonies, its ri|tual
is pure, and worthy of a divine Au|thor.
Its po&s;itive in&s;titutions are few in
number, mo&s;t &s;ignificant of &s;piritual
things, and directly conducive to good
life and practice. How inexcu&s;able then
are we, if, placed in &s;uch happy circum|&s;tances,
the &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e obligations to
the public wor&s;hip of God &s;hall be oblite|rated
among us, which the light of nature
<PB N="230" REF="239">
inculcated, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on the mo&s;t
wild and barbarous nations?</P>
<P>The refinements of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy
have indeed &s;ugge&s;ted this &s;hadow of ob|jection,
that God is too great to &s;tand in
need of any external &s;ervice from his crea|tures;
that our expre&s;&s;ions of prai&s;e and
honour are mi&s;placed with re&s;pect to him,
who is above all honour and all prai&s;e;
that in his &s;ight the homage we &s;eek to
pay mu&s;t appear contemptible; and is
therefore in it&s;elf &s;uperfluous and trif|fling.
&mdash;But who hath taught tho&s;e vain
rea&s;oners, that all expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude
and honour towards a &s;uperior become
un&s;uitable, merely becau&s;e that &s;uperior
needs not any returns? Were they ever
indebted to one who&s;e favours they had
it not in their power to repay; and, did
they, on that account, feel them&s;elves &s;et
loo&s;e from every obligation to acknow|ledge,
and to prai&s;e their benefactor? On
the contrary, the more di&s;intere&s;ted his
beneficence was, did not gratitude, in any
ingenuous mind, burn with the greater
<PB N="231" REF="240">
ardour, and prompt them the more eager|ly
to &s;eize every opportunity of publicly
te&s;tifying the feelings of their hearts?&mdash;Almighty
God, it is true, is too great to
need our &s;ervice or homage. But he is
al&s;o too good not to accept it, when it is
the native expre&s;&s;ion of a grateful and ge|nerous
mind. If pride and &s;elf-&s;ufficien|cy
&s;tiffle all &s;entiments of dependance on
our Creator; if levity, and attachment to
worldly plea&s;ures, render us totally ne|glectful
of expre&s;&s;ing our thankfulne&s;s to
Him for his ble&s;&s;ings; do we not hereby
di&s;cover &s;uch a want of proper feeling,
&s;uch a degree of hardne&s;s and corruption
in our affections, as &s;hows us to be im|moral
and unworthy; and mu&s;t ju&s;tly ex|po&s;e
us to the high di&s;plea&s;ure of heaven?
On the contrary, according to every no|tion
which we can form of the Father of
the univer&s;e, mu&s;t it not be acceptable
to him to behold his creatures properly
affected in heart towards their great bene|factor;
a&s;&s;embling together to expre&s;s, in
acts of wor&s;hip, that gratitude, love, and
<PB N="232" REF="241">
reverence which they own him; and thus
nouri&s;hing and promoting in one another
an affectionate &s;en&s;e of his goodne&s;s? Are
not &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions, and &s;uch a behavi|our
as this, intimately connected with all
virtue?</P>
<P><HI>O Come, let us wor&s;hip and bow down;
let us kneel before the Lord our maker. For
he is our God; and we are the flock of his
pa&s;ture. Enter into his gates with thank&s;|giving
and his courts with prai&s;e. The pray|er
of the upright in his delight. It cometh be|fore
him as incen&s;e, and the uplifting of their
hands as the evening &s;acrifice.</HI>&mdash;Having
thus &s;hown the rea&s;onablene&s;s of public
wor&s;hip with re&s;pect to God, let us now,</P>
<P>II. CONSIDER its importance in another
view, as it re&s;pects the world. When we
&s;urvey the general &s;tate of mankind, we
find them continually immer&s;ed in world|ly
affairs; bu&s;ied about providing the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life, occupied in the pur&s;uits
of their plea&s;ures, or eagerly pro&s;ecuting
the advancement of their intere&s;ts. In
<PB N="233" REF="242">
&s;uch a &s;ituation of things, a &s;mall mea|&s;ure
of reflexion might convince any one,
that without &s;ome returns of &s;acred days,
and &s;ome &s;olemn calls to public wor&s;hip,
it were impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve in the
world any &s;en&s;e of objects, &s;o foreign to
the general current of thought as an in|vi&s;ible
Governor, and a future &s;tate. If it
be of importance to the peace and good
order of &s;ociety, that there &s;hould prevail
among men the belief of One in the hea|vens,
who is the protector of righteou&s;ne&s;s
and the avenger of crimes; if it be of im|portance
that they be taught to look for|ward
to a day of judgement, when they
are to be brought to account for their
mo&s;t &s;ecret actions, and eternally reward|ed
or puni&s;hed, according as their con|duct
has been good or evil; if &s;uch prin|ciples
as the&s;e, I &s;ay, be of con&s;equence
to the public welfare, they certainly en|force
the authority of public wor&s;hip,
and prove the nece&s;&s;ity of religious in|&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="243">
I &s;peak now particularly with a view
to the multitude, the great ma&s;s and body
of the people. We all know, how &s;eldom
from education, or private in&s;truction,
they have the advantage of deriving &s;en|timents
of religion or morality. Early
obliged to labour for their bread, they
would remain all their days in gro&s;s igno|rance
of every moral or &s;acred principle,
were it not for tho&s;e public a&s;&s;emblies in
which they hear of God, and Chri&s;t, and
judgement, and heaven and hell. Shut
up tho&s;e temples to which they re&s;ort
with reverence; exclude them from the
opportunities they now po&s;&s;e&s;s of receiv|ing
religious in&s;truction, and imbibing
religious ideas; and what can you expect
them to become? no other than a feroci|ous
rabble, who &s;et free from checks of
con&s;cience, and fears of divine vengeance,
would be prone to every outrage which
they could commit with impunity. It is
well known that, in the early ages of the
world, &s;ages and legi&s;lators who endea|voured
to tame and to a&s;&s;ociate the bar|barous
<PB N="235" REF="244">
hordes of men, found it nece&s;&s;ary
for this purpo&s;e, to have recour&s;e to reli|gion.
By bringing the rude multitudes to
wor&s;hip together, and at &s;tated times and
places, to join in hymns and &s;ongs to their
deities, they gradually re&s;trained them from
violence, and trained them to &s;ubordina|tion
and civilized life.</P>
<P>During the progre&s;s of &s;ociety in after
periods, religious a&s;&s;emblies at church con|tinue,
I am per&s;uaded, to have a very con|&s;iderable
influence on the civilization and
improvement of the people. Even inde|pendent
of effect upon their moral princi|ples,
by leading numbers of them to meet to|gether
in an orderly way, and in their mo&s;t
decent appearance, they tend to humanize
and poli&s;h their manners. They &s;trength|en
the &s;ocial connections, and promote
friendly intercour&s;e among tho&s;e who are
in the &s;ame neighbourhood, and in the
&s;ame lines of life. It mu&s;t at the &s;ame
time, be agreeable to every humane mind
to think, that one day in &s;even is allotted
for re&s;t to the poor from their daily la|bours,
<PB N="236" REF="245">
and for &s;uch enjoyments of ea&s;e
and comfort as their &s;tation affords.
It is the only day which gives them oc|ca&s;ion
to feel them&s;elves as belonging
to the &s;ame cla&s;s of beings with their &s;u|periors;
when joining with them in the
&s;ame acts of wor&s;hip, and recognizing
a common Lord. Amid&s;t tho&s;e di&s;|tinctions
which the difference of ranks
nece&s;&s;arily introduces into human &s;ociety,
it is &s;urely fit that there be &s;ome occa&s;ions
when man can meet with man as a bro|ther,
in order that the pride of the great
may be checked; and the low may be
taught that, if they di&s;charge properly
their appointed part, they have rea&s;on to
expect, from the $ord of the univer&s;e, the
&s;ame rewards with the rich and the
mighty.</P>
<P>It will, I believe, be generally admit|ted
that forms of public wor&s;hip, and
means of religious in&s;truction, are impor|tant,
on &s;everal accounts, for the body of
the people, and belong to the maintenance
of public &s;afety and order. But many
<PB N="237" REF="246">
who admit this are apt to think, that to
the common people alone they may be
left. To per&s;ons of liberal education and
enlarged minds, what benefit can ari&s;e
from hearing what they already know;
and what, perhaps, is to be inculcated on
them by tho&s;e who are of inferior capaci|ty
to them&s;elves?&mdash;Admitting this plea
of &s;uperiority which their vanity forms,
and &s;etting a&s;ide for the pre&s;ent any per|&s;onal
obligation they are under to wor|&s;hip
God, I mu&s;t a&s;k &s;uch per&s;ons, how
they can expect that religious a&s;&s;emblies
will be long re&s;pected by the lower ranks
of men, if by men of rank and education
they are di&s;countenanced and for&s;aken?
Do not they know, that tho&s;e lower ranks
are ready to copy the manners, and to
follow the example of their &s;uperiors in
all things; but a&s;&s;uredly in nothing more,
than in what appears to &s;et them free
from re&s;traint, and to gratify licentiou&s;|ne&s;s?
While they acknowledge the impor|tance,
and even the nece&s;&s;ity, of public re|ligion
to certain cla&s;&s;es of men, do they,
<PB N="238" REF="247">
neverthele&s;s, contribute by their beha|viour
to defeat the end of public religion,
and to annihilate that importance which
they a&s;cribe to it?&mdash;They are employ|ed
in framing laws and &s;tatutes for pre|venting
crimes, and keeping the di&s;order|ly
multitude within bounds; and at the
&s;ame time, by per&s;onally di&s;countenan|cing
public wor&s;hip, they are weakening,
they are even aboli&s;hing, among the mul|titutde,
that moral re&s;traint, which is of
more general influence upon manners
than all the laws they frame. In vain
they complain of the di&s;hone&s;ty of
&s;ervants, of the in&s;olence of mobs,
of the attacks of the highwayman.
To all the&s;e di&s;orders they have them|&s;elves
been acce&s;&s;ory. By their open di&s;|regard
of &s;acred in&s;titutions, they have
di&s;&s;eminated profligacy among the peo|ple.
They have broken down the flood|gates
which &s;erved to re&s;train the torrent;
they have let it loo&s;e to overflow the land;
and by the growing deluge may them|&s;elves
be &s;wept away.&mdash;But I mu&s;t next ar|gue
upon a different ground; and proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="248">
III. To &s;et forth the importance of the
public wor&s;hip of God to every individu|al,
in every rank of life. Whatever his
&s;tation be, he is &s;till a man; and has the
duties of a man to perform. Were his
attendance on divine wor&s;hip of no other
effect, than to add countenance to a &s;alu|tary
in&s;titution, this alone would render
it his duty. But moreover, we a&s;&s;ert it to
be his duty on his own account; if it be
the duty of every man to u&s;e the proper
means of pre&s;erving and fortifying his
virtue. All the Chri&s;tian in&s;titutions have
a direct tendency to this end. They all
&s;erve to give warmth to piety, and to add
&s;olemnity to moral virtue. A very high
opinion, indeed, that man mu&s;t have of
his own character, who imagines that, a|mid&s;t
all the follies and corruptions of the
world, he &s;tands in need of no a&s;&s;i&s;tance
for enabling him to act his part with pro|priety
and dignity.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not, whether per&s;ons of
rank and education are to learn any thing
that is new to them, by frequenting the
<PB N="240" REF="249">
places of public wor&s;hip. The great prin|ciples
of piety and morality are obvious
and ea&s;ily known; and we &s;hall readily
admit, that there are many to whom no
new in&s;truction is communicated in the
hou&s;e of God. But, my friends, the pur|po&s;e
of your going there is to have known
truths recalled to your mind, and their
dormant influence awakened; is to have
&s;erious meditations &s;ugge&s;ted; to have
good di&s;po&s;itions rai&s;ed; to have the heart
adju&s;ted to a compo&s;ed and tranquil
frame. Is there any man of rea&s;on and
reflection, who will not acknowledge &s;uch
effects, as far as they follow from attend|ance
on religious ordinances, to be of the
mo&s;t beneficial nature? The&s;e occa&s;ional
ce&s;&s;ations from the cares and anxieties of
life, the&s;e interruptions to the bu&s;tle and
the pa&s;&s;ions of the world, in order to think
and hear of eternity, are both a relief and
an improvement to the mind. By this re|treat
from its ordinary circle of thoughts,
it is enabled to return, with more clearne&s;s
<PB N="241" REF="250">
and more vigour, to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
world, after a &s;erious and proper pau&s;e.</P>
<P>But I think mu&s;t a&s;k the per&s;ons with whom
I now rea&s;on, whether there be no other
call to come to God's hou&s;e, than to hear
in&s;truction there? Is not the devout ado|ration
of the God of heaven the principal
object of our religious a&s;&s;emblies; and is
this what any man of reflection, and of
&s;ober mind, dare to make light of? In the
temple of the Lord, the rich and the poor,
the prince and the pea&s;ant, appear as &s;up|pliants
alike for the protection and favour
of the Almighty.&mdash;Great and flouri&s;hing
as thou may&s;t think thy&s;elf, know that
thou &s;tande&s;t as much in need of that
protection, as the meane&s;t of the crowd
whom thou beholde&s;t wor&s;hipping, with
lowly reverence, the God of their fathers.
The &s;un of pro&s;perity &s;hines at pre&s;ent on
thy head, and the favourable gale carries
thee &s;oftly along the &s;tream of life. But
the Almighty needs only to give the word,
and in&s;tantly the tempe&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e; and
they frail bark &s;hall be driven into the o|cean,
<PB N="242" REF="251">
and whelmed in the deep. <HI>In my
pro&s;perity I &s;aid I &s;hall never be moved.
Thou, Lord, did&s;t hide thy face, and I was
troubled.</HI>&mdash;Look up, with dread, to that aw|ful
hand of providence which is &s;tretched
over your heads. Remember the in&s;tabi|lity
of all human things; Remember it,
and tremble, ye who de&s;pi&s;e the devout
acknowledgement of Him who di&s;po&s;es of
the human fate! <HI>Though ye live many years
and rejoice in them all, remember the days of
darken&s;s; for they &s;hall be many</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>But after all that has been urged on this
&s;ubject, I am &s;en&s;ible it may be objected,
that many who make con&s;cience of pay|ing
&s;trict regard to the in&s;titutions of re|ligion,
do not appear to have derived much
benefit from them. They are not, it will
be &s;aid, more improved in moral conduct,
and in the proper di&s;charge of the &s;everal
duties of life, than others who have been
apparently negligent of the &s;ervices of the
<PB N="243" REF="252">
church. On the contrary, a formal re|gard
to the&s;e appears to be &s;u|&s;tituted by
many, in the room of the weightier mat|ters
of the law.&mdash;Though this &s;hould be
admitted, it goes no farther than to &s;how
that human weakne&s;s, or corruption, may
defeat the purpo&s;e of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing
means of moral improvement. That a
&s;uper&s;titious attention to external wor&s;hip,
has too often u&s;urped the character, and
&s;upplanted the place of real virtue, willl
not be denied. Admonitions again&s;t &s;o
dangerous an error cannot be given too
often. But becau&s;e the be&s;t things have
been often mi&s;applied and abu&s;ed, no ar|gument
thence ari&s;es for their being un|dervalued,
and thrown a&s;ide. So al&s;o rea|&s;on,
in&s;truction, and di&s;cipline of every
kind, have been frequently perverted to
bad ends; and yet their intrin&s;ic worth
and u&s;efulne&s;s remain untouched and ac|knowledged.
&mdash;Be&s;ides this, it cannot be
admitted that, becau&s;e religious in&s;titu|tions
produce not all the good that might
be wi&s;hed, and hoped for, they therefore
<PB N="244" REF="253">
do no good at all. This were a ra&s;h and
ill-founded conclu&s;ion. If the morals of
men are not always amended by them as
they ought to have been, there is rea&s;on,
however, to think that they would have
been wor&s;e without them. Some check
is always given by them to open profliga|cy.
Some a&s;&s;i&s;tance is furni&s;hed to good
di&s;po&s;itions of heart; at lea&s;t, to decency
of manners. Even momentary impre&s;|&s;ions
of &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s made on the thoughtle&s;s
by the &s;olemnities of religion, are not
without their fruit. They leave general|ly
&s;ome trace behind them; and when the
traces are often renewed, they may be
hoped, through the divine ble&s;&s;ing, to
form at la&s;t a deep impre&s;&s;ion on the
mind.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame time, I do not &s;ay that re|ligious
in&s;titutions work upon the mind
like a charm; and that mere bodily at|tendance
on them will always en&s;ure us
of &s;ome profitable effect. Let the means
that are employed, for the improvement
of rational beings, be ever &s;o powerful in
<PB N="245" REF="254">
them&s;elves, much of their &s;ucce&s;s will al|ways
depend on the manner in which
they are received and applied. I &s;hall
therefore conclude my rea&s;onings on this
&s;ubject, with a few ob&s;ervations concerning
the di&s;po&s;itions requi&s;ite on our part, for
deriving benefit from the public ordinan|ces
of religion.</P>
<P>THE ends for which we a&s;&s;emble in the
hou&s;e of God are two; to wor&s;hip God,
and to li&s;ten to religious in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>The public wor&s;hip of God is the chief
and mo&s;t &s;acred purpo&s;e of every religious
a&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;tians. Let it here be re|membered,
that it is not the uttering, or
the hearing of certain words, that con&s;ti|tutes
the wor&s;hip of the Almighty. It is
the heart that prai&s;es, or prays. If the
heart accompany not the words that are
&s;poken or heard, we <HI>offer the &s;acrifice of
fools.</HI> By the inattentive thought, and the
giddy and wandering eye, we profane the
temple of the Lord, and turn the appear|ance
of devotion into in&s;ult and mockery.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="255">
With regard to religious in&s;truction, at|tention
and reverence are unque&s;tionably
due. All religious and moral knowledge
comes from God. It is a light from hea|ven,
fir&s;t tran&s;mitted to man by the ori|ginal
con&s;titution of his nature, and after|wards
made to &s;hine with fairer and fuller
lu&s;tre by the revelation of the go&s;pel in
Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Its brightne&s;s may &s;ome|times
be &s;tronger, and &s;ometimes weaker,
according to the mediums by which it is
conveyed. But &s;till, as far as the in&s;truc|tions
delivered from the pulpit are illu|minated
by the ray from heaven, they
are the truths of God, and ought to be re|ceived
as &s;uch. Refinements of vain phi|lo&s;ophy,
or intricate &s;ubtilities of theologu|cal
controver&s;y, are undoubtedly not en|titled
to &s;uch regard. But when the great
principles of natural or revealed religion
are di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; when the important doc|trines
of the go&s;pel concerning the life,
and &s;ufferings, and death of our ble&s;&s;ed Re|deemer
are di&s;played; or u&s;eful in&s;truc|tions
regarding the regulation of life, and
<PB N="247" REF="256">
the proper di&s;pcharge of our &s;everal duties,
are the &s;ubjects brought into view; it is
not then the human &s;peaker, but the di|vine
authority that is to be regarded.</P>
<P>In the &s;peaker, many imperfections and
infirmities may be di&s;covered. The di&s;co|veries
of the go&s;pel are repre&s;ented in
the &s;cripture, as a hidden trea&s;ure brought to
light; but, by the appointment of God,
<HI>we have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">2. Corinth. 4. 7.</NOTE>.
It is not the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity that ought
to bring us to church. Too often, it is to
be feared, we a&s;&s;emble there merely as
critics on the preacher; critics on his &s;en|timents,
his language, and his delivery.
But, &s;uch are not the di&s;o&s;itions which
become us on &s;o &s;erious an occa&s;ion. It
is with humility, with fairne&s;s, and can|dour,
with an intention to improve our|&s;elves
in piety and virtue, with a view to
make per&s;onal application to our own cha|racter,
that we ought to hear the word of
<PB N="248" REF="257">
God.&mdash;When we enter the &s;acred tem|ple,
let us ever con&s;ider our&s;elves as crea|tures
&s;urrounded with darkne&s;s, &s;eeking
illumination from heaven; as guilty crea|tures,
imploring forgivene&s;s from our
judge; as frail and mortal creatures, pre|paring
for that eternal habitation into
which we know not how &s;oon we are to
pa&s;s.</P>
<P>IF, with &s;uch &s;entiments and impre&s;|&s;ions
we join in the wor&s;hip of God, and
the ordinances of religion, we may ju&s;tly
hope that they &s;hall be accompanied to us
with the divine ble&s;&s;ing. It is the expre&s;s
precept of God, <HI>not to for&s;ake the a&s;&s;embling
of our&s;elves together</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 10. 25.</NOTE>. <HI>Gather together the
people, men, women, and children, that they
may hear, and that they may learn, and fear
the Lord your God, and ob&s;erve to do all
the words of this law</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxi. 12.</NOTE>. <HI>Enter his gates
<PB N="249" REF="258">
with thank&s;giving, and his courts with
prai&s;e. Give unto the Lord the glory due to
his name.</HI>&mdash;Thus hath God commanded,
and he never commanded his people to
&s;eek his name in vain. For, <HI>where two or
three are gathered together in his name, our
Lord hath told us that he is in the mid&s;t of
them</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. xviii. 20.</NOTE>. <HI>God hath &s;aid that he loveth the
gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of
Jacob</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxxvii. 2.</NOTE>. <HI>The prayer of the upright is his
delight.</HI> Both in their temporal and &s;pi|ritual

de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions we are connected
with the objects around us, that our at|tachment
to them is always in hazard of
becoming exce&s;&s;ive and &s;inful. Hence re|ligion

<PB N="251" REF="260">
this attachment, by rectifying our errone|ous
opinions, and in&s;tructing us in the
proper value we ought to &s;et on worldly
things. Such was particularly the &s;cope
of the Apo&s;tle in this context. He is put|ting
the Corinthians in mind that their
<HI>time is &s;hort;</HI> that every thing here is tran|&s;itory;
and therefore, that in all the diffe|rent

they were ever to keep in view this con|&s;ideration,
that <HI>the fa&s;hion of this world pa&s;|&s;eth
away.</HI> The original expre&s;&s;ion im|ports,
the figure or form under which the
world pre&s;ents it&s;elf to us. The meaning
is, All that belongs to this vi&s;ible &s;tate is
continually changing. Nothing in hu|man
affairs is fixed or &s;table. All is in
motion and fluctuation; altering its ap|pearance
every moment, and pa&s;&s;ing into
&s;ome new form. Let us meditate for a
little on the &s;erious view which is here
given us of the world, in order that we
may attend to the improvements which
is &s;ugge&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="261">
I. <HI>The fa&s;hion of the world pa&s;&s;eth away,</HI>
as the opinions, ideas, and manners of
men are always changing. We look in
vain for a &s;tandard to a&s;certain and fix
any of the&s;e; in vain expect that what
has been approved and e&s;tabli&s;hed for a
while, is always to endure. Principles
which were of high authority among our
ance&s;tors are now exploded. Sy&s;tems of
philo&s;ophy which were once univer&s;ally
received, and taught as infallible truths,
are now obliterated and forgotten. Modes
of living behaving, and employing time,
the pur&s;uits of the bu&s;y, and the enter|tainments
of the gay, have been entirely
changed. They were the offspring of
fa&s;hion, the children of a day. When
they had run their cour&s;e, they expired;
and were &s;ucceeded by other modes of
living, and thinking, and acting, which
the glo&s;s of novelty recommended for a
while to the public ta&s;te.</P>
<P>When we read an account of the man|ners
and occupations, of the &s;tudies and
opinions, even of our own countrymen,
<PB N="253" REF="262">
in &s;ome remote age, we &s;eem to be read|ing
the hi&s;tory of a different world from
what we now inhabit. Coming down|wards
through &s;ome generations, a new
face of things appears. Men begin to
think, and act, in a different train; and
what we call refinement gradually opens.
Arriving at our own times, we con&s;ider
our&s;elves as having widely enlarged the
&s;phere of knowledge on every &s;ide, hav|ing
formed ju&s;t ideas on every &s;ub|ject;
having attained the proper &s;tandard
of manners and behaviour; and wonder
at the ignorance, the uncouthne&s;s, and
ru&s;ticity of our forefathers. But, alas!
what appears to us &s;o perfect &s;hall in its
turn pa&s;s away. The next race, while
they &s;hove us off the &s;tage, will introduce
their favourite di&s;coveries and innova|tions;
and what we now admire as the
height of improvement, may in a few ages
hence be con&s;idered as altogether rude and
imperfect. As one wave effaces the ridge
which the former had made on the &s;and
by the &s;ea &s;hore, &s;o every &s;ucceeding age
<PB N="254" REF="263">
obliterates the opinions and modes of the
age which had gone before it. <HI>The fa&s;hion
of the world</HI> is ever pa&s;&s;ing away.</P>
<P>Let us only think of the changes which
our own ideas and opinions undergo in
the progre&s;s of life. One man differs not
more from another, than the &s;ame man
varies from him&s;elf in different periods,
of his age, and in different &s;ituations of
fortune. In youth, and in opulence, eve|ry
thing appears &s;miling and gay. We
fly as on the wings of fancy; and &s;urvey
beauties wherever we ca&s;t our eye. But
let &s;ome more years have pa&s;&s;ed over our
heads, or let di&s;appointments in the world
have depre&s;&s;ed our &s;pirits; and what a
change takes place? The plea&s;ing illu&s;ions
that once &s;hone before us; the &s;plendid
fabrics that imagination had reared; the
enchanting maze in which we once wan|dered
with delight, all vani&s;h and are for|gotten.
The world it&s;elf remains the
&s;ame. But its for, its appearance, and
a&s;pect, is changed to our view; its <HI>fa&s;hion,</HI>
as to us, hath <HI>pa&s;&s;ed away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="264">
II. WHILE our opinions and ideas are
thus changing within, the condition of
all external things is, at the &s;ame time,
ever changing without us, and around us.
Wherever we ca&s;t our eyes over the face
of nature, or the monuments of art, we
di&s;cern the marks of alteration and vici&s;&s;i|tude.
We cannot travel far upon the
earth, without being pre&s;ented with many
a &s;triking memorial of the changes made
by time. What was once a flouri&s;hing
city, is now a neglected village. Where
ca&s;tles and palaces &s;tood, fallen towers
and ruined walls appear. Where the mag|nificence
of the great &s;hone, and the mirth
of the gay re&s;ounded, there, as the prophet
I&s;aiah de&s;cribes, <HI>the owl and the raven now
dwell, thorns come up, and the n$ttle and the
bramble grow in the courts.</HI>&mdash;When we
read the hi&s;tory of nations, what do we
read but the hi&s;tory of ince&s;&s;ant revolution
and change? We behold kingdoms alter|nately
ri&s;ing and falling; peace and war
taking place by turns; princes, heroes,
and &s;tate&s;men, coming forth in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="256" REF="265">
on the &s;tage, attracting our attention for
a little by the &s;plended figure they make,
and then di&s;appearing and forgotten. We
&s;ee the <HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> a&s;&s;uming all its
different forms, and in all of them, <HI>pa&s;&s;ing
away.</HI></P>
<P>But to hi&s;torical annals there is no oc|ca&s;ion
for our having recour&s;e. Let any
one, who has made &s;ome progre&s;s in life,
recollect only what he has beheld pa&s;&s;ing
before him, in his own time. We have
&s;een our country ri&s;e triumphant among
the nations; and we have &s;een it al&s;o
humbled in its turn. We have &s;een in
one hemi&s;phere of the globe new do|nions
acquired, and in another hemi|&s;phere,
our old dominions lo&s;t. At
home, we have &s;een factions and par|ties
&s;hift through all their different
forms; and admini&s;trations, in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
ri&s;e and fall.. What were once the great
themes of eager di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and political
conte&s;t, are now forgotten. Fathers re|count
them to their children as the tal$
of other times. New actors have come
<PB N="257" REF="266">
forth on the &s;tage of the world. New ob|jects
have attracted the attention, and new
intrigues engaged the pa&s;&s;ions of men.
New members fill the &s;eats of ju&s;tice; new
mini&s;ters the temples of religion; and a
new world, in &s;hort, in the cour&s;e of a
few years, has gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly
ri&s;en around us.</P>
<P>When from the public &s;cene we turn
our eye to our own private connections,
the changes which have taken place in the
<HI>fa&s;hion of the world,</HI> mu&s;t touch every
reflecting mind with a more tender &s;en&s;i|bility.
For where are now, many of the
companions of our early years; many
of tho&s;e with whom we fir&s;t began the
race of life; and who&s;e hopes and pro|&s;pects
were once the &s;ame with our
own? In recollecting our old acquaintance
and friends, what deva&s;tations have been
made by the hand of time? On the ru|ins
of our former connections, new ones
have ari&s;en; new relations have been
formed; and the circle of tho&s;e among
whom we live is altogether changed from
<PB N="258" REF="267">
what it once was. Comparing our pre|&s;ent
&s;ituation with our former condition
of life; looking back to our father's hou&s;e,
and to the &s;cenes of youth; remembering
the friends by whom we were trained,
and the family in which we grew up; who,
but with inward emotion, recollects tho&s;e
days of former years, and is di&s;po&s;ed to
drop the &s;ilent tear, when he views the
<HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> thus always <HI>pa&s;&s;ing a|way!</HI></P>
<P>III. NOT only our connections with all
things around us change, but our own
life, through all its &s;tages and conditions,
is ever pa&s;&s;ing away. How ju&s;t, and how
affecting is that image, employed in the
&s;acred writings to de&s;cribe the &s;tate of
man, <HI>we &s;pend our years as a tale that is
told</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. xc. 9.</NOTE>! It is not to any thing great or
la&s;ting that human life is compared; not
to a monument that is built, or t$ an in|&s;cription
<PB N="259" REF="268">
that is engraved; not even to a
book that is written, or to a hi&s;tory that is
recorded; but to a <HI>tale,</HI> which is li&s;tened
to for a little; where the words are fu|gitive
and pa&s;&s;ing, and where one incident
&s;uc$eds and hangs on another, till, by in|&s;en&s;ible
tran&s;itions, we are brought to the
clo&s;e; <HI>a tale,</HI> which in &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages may
be amu&s;ing, in others, tedious; but whe|ther
it amu&s;es or fatigues, is &s;oon told,
and &s;oon forg$tt$n. Thus, year &s;teals up|on
us after year. Life is never &s;tanding
&s;till for a moment; but continually, though
in&s;en&s;ibly, &s;liding into a new form. Infancy
ri$es up fa&s;t to childhood; childhood to
youth; youth pa&s;&s;$s quickly into manhood;
and the grey hair and the faded look are not
long of admoni&s;hing us, that old age is at
hand. In this cour&s;e all generations run.
The world is made up of uncea&s;ing rounds
of tran&s;itory exi&s;tence. Some generations
are coming forward into being, and others
ha&s;tening to leave it. The &s;tream which
carries us all along is ever flowing with a
<PB N="260" REF="269">
quick current, though with a &s;till and
noi&s;el$&s;s cour&s;e. The dwelling place o$
man is continually emptying, and by a
fre&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of inhabitants, continually
filling anew. <HI>The memory of man pa&s;&s;$th
away, like the $$membrance of a gue&s;$ wh$
hath tarried but one night.</HI></P>
<P>As the life of man, con&s;idered in its du|ration,
thus fleets and pa&s;&s;es away, &s;o du|ring
the time it la&s;ts, its condition is p$r|petually
changing. It affords us nothing
on which we can &s;et up our re&s;t; no en|joyment
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion which we can pro|perly
call our own. When we have be|gun
to be placed in &s;uch circum&s;tances
as we de&s;ired, and wi&s;h our lives to pro|ceed
in the &s;ame agreeable tenor, how o$|ten
comes &s;ome unexpected event acro&s;s,
to di&s;concert all our $chemes of happin$&s;s?
Our health declines; our friends die; our
families are &s;cattered; &s;omething or other
is not long of occurring, to &s;how us that
the wheel mu&s;t turn round; <HI>the fa&s;hion of
the world</HI> mu&s;t <HI>pa&s;s away.</HI> Is there any
man who dare$ to look to futurity with
<PB N="261" REF="270">
an eye of confident hope; and to &s;ay, that
again&s;t a year hence, $ie can promi&s;e be|ing
in the &s;ame condition of health or for|tune,
as he is at pre&s;ent? The &s;eeds of
change are every where &s;own in our &s;tate;
and the very cau&s;es that &s;eemed to pro|mi&s;e
u$ &s;$$curity, are often &s;ecretly under|mining
it. Great fame provokes the at|tacks
of envy and reproach. High health
gives occa&s;ion to intemperance anddi&s;ea&s;e.
The elevation of the mighty never fails
to render their condition tottering; and
that ob&s;curity which &s;h$lters the mean,
expo&s;es them, at the &s;ame time, to become
the prey of oppre&s;&s;ion. So completely
is the <HI>fa&s;hion of this world</HI> made by Provi|dence
for change, and prepared for <HI>pa&s;&s;ing
away.</HI> In the mid&s;t of this in&s;tability, it
were &s;ome comfort, did human pro&s;perity
decay as &s;lowly as it ri&s;$s. By $low de|grees,
and by many intervening &s;t$ps, it
ri&s;es. But one day is &s;ufficient to &s;$at|ter,
and bring it to nought. I might
add,</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="271">
That the world it&s;elf in which we
dwell, the ba&s;is of all our pre&s;ent Enjoy|m$nts,
is it&s;elf contrived for change, and
de&s;igned to pa&s;s away. While the g$n$|rations
of men come forth in their tu$$,
like troops of &s;ucceeding pilgrims, to $word$
their part on this globe, the globe $word$
which they act is tottering under th$$$ f$$/
It was once over$lowed by a d$luge. It $word$
&s;haken by earthquakes; it is undermin$d
by &s;ubterraneous fires; it carries many
a mark of haing &s;uffered violent c$$|vul&s;ions,
and of t$nding to di&s;&s;oluti$$.
Revelation informs us, that there is a $word$
approaching, in which <HI>the heavens $word$

When this d$&s;tined hour arrives, the <HI>$$|&s;hion
of the world</HI> &s;hall have finally $word$
away. Immortal &s;pirits &s;hall then $word$
back upon this world, as we do at pre&s;ent $word$

<PB N="263" REF="272">
exi&s;tence, and their place is no more to be
found.</P>
<P>I SHALL in&s;i&s;t no longer on this repre|&s;entation
of things. Enough has been
&s;aid, to &s;how that the <HI>fa&s;hion of the world,</HI>
in every &s;en&s;e, <HI>p$&s;&s;es</HI> away. Opinions and
manners, public affairs and private con|cerns,
the life of man, the conditions of
fortune, and the earth it&s;elf on which we
dwell, are all changing around us.&mdash;Is
every thing, then, with which we are
connected, pa&s;&s;ing and tran&s;itory? Is the
whole &s;tate of man no more than a dream
of fleeting vi&s;ion? Is he brought forth, to
be only the child of a day? Are we thrown
into a river, where all flows, and nothing
&s;tays; where we have no means of re&s;i&s;t|ing
the current; nor can reach any firm
ground, on which to re&s;t our foot?&mdash;No,
my brethren; man was not doomed to be
&s;o unhappy; nor made by his Creator &s;o
much in vain. There are three fixed and
permanent objects, to which I mu&s;t now
call your attention, as the great &s;upports
<PB N="264" REF="273">
of human con&s;tancy amid&s;t this fugitive
&s;tate. Though this world changes and
pa&s;&s;es away, virtue and goodne&s;s never
change; God never changes; heaven and
immortality pa&s;s not away.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> VIRTUE and goodne&s;s never
change. Let opinions and manners, con|ditions
and &s;ituations, in public and in
private life, alter as they will, virtue is
ever the $ame. It re&s;ts on the immove|able
ba&s;is of Eternal Truth. Among all
the revolutions of human things it main|tains
its ground; ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the vene|ration
and e&s;teem of mankind, and con|f$rring
on the heart, which enjoys it, &s;a|tisfaction
and peace. Con&s;ult the mo&s;t
remote antiquity. Look to the mo&s;t &s;a|vage
nations of the earth. How wild,
and how fluctuating &s;oever the ideas of
men may have been, this opinion you will
find to have always prevailed, that probi|ty,
truth, and b$neficence, form the honour
and the excellency of man. In this, the
philo&s;opher and the $avage, the warrior
<PB N="265" REF="274">
and the hermit, join. At this altar all
have wor&s;hipped. Their o$ferings may
have been un&s;eemly. Their notions of
virtue may have been rude, and occa&s;ion|ally
tainted by ignorance and &s;upper&s;tition;
but the fundamental ideas of moral worth
have ever remained the &s;ame.</P>
<P>Here then is one point of &s;tability, af|fected
by no vici$&s;itudes of time and life,
on which we may re&s;t. Our fortunes
may change, and our friends may die;
but virtue may &s;till be our own; and as
long as this remains, we are never mi&s;era|ble.
<HI>Till I die I will not remove my inte|grity
from me. My righteou&s;ne&s;s I hold fa&s;t,
and will not let it go. My hea$ &s;hall not re|proach
me &s;o long as I live</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Job xxvii. 5, 6.</NOTE>. He who, with
the holy man of old, can hold this language,
may with undi&s;turbed mind &s;urvey time
flying away, life decaying, and the whole
fa&s;hion of the world changing around him.
He hath within him&s;elf, a &s;ource of con|&s;olation
and hope, independent of all earth|ly
<PB N="266" REF="275">
objects. Every terre&s;trial glory &s;par|kles
only for a little, with tran&s;ient bright|ne&s;s.
But virtue &s;hines with eternal and
unalterable &s;plendour. It derives its ori|gin
from heaven; and partakes both of the
lu&s;tre, and the &s;tability, of cele&s;tial objects.
<HI>It is the brightne&s;s of the everla&s;ting light;
the un&s;potted mir$or of God, and the image
of his goodne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, God never changes.
Amid&s;t the uncea&s;ing vici&s;&s;itude of ea$th|ly
things, there remains at the head of
the univer&s;e an eternal protector of vir|tue,
who&s;e <HI>throne is e&s;tabli&s;hed for ever.</HI>
With him there is <HI>no variablene&s;s, neither
any &s;hadow of turning;</HI> no incon&s;tancy of
purpo&s;e, and no decay of wi&s;dom or of
power. We know that he loved righte|ou&s;ne&s;s
from the beginning of days, and
that he will continue to love it unaltera|bly
to the la&s;t. Fore&s;een by him was eve|ry
revolution which the cour&s;e of ages
has produced. All the changes which
happen in the &s;tate of nature, or the life
<PB N="267" REF="276">
of men, were comprehended in his decree.
How much &s;oever worldly things may
change in them&s;elves, they are all united
in his plan; they con&s;titute one great &s;y&s;|tem
or whole, of which he is the Author;
and which, at its final completion, &s;hall
appear to be perfect. His dominion
holds together, in a continued chain, the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive variety of human events; gives
&s;tability to things that in them&s;elves are
fluctuating; gives con&s;tancy even to the
<HI>fa&s;hion of the world</HI> while it is <HI>pa&s;&s;ing away.</HI>
Wherefore, though all things change on
earth, and we our&s;elves be involved in the
general mutability, yet as long as, with
tru&s;t and hope, we look up to this Supreme
Being, we re&s;t on the <HI>rock of ages,</HI> and are
&s;afe amid&s;t every change. We po&s;&s;&s;e&s;s a
fortre&s;s to which we can have recour&s;e in
all dangers; a refuge under all &s;torms;
<HI>a dwelling pl$ce in all generations.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t place, heaven and
immortality pa&s;s not away. The fleeting
&s;cenes of this life are to be con&s;idered as
no more than an introduction to a nobler
<PB N="268" REF="277">
and more permanent order of things,
when man &s;hall have attained the matu|rity
of his being. This is what rea&s;on
gave &s;ome ground to expect; what reve|lation
has fully con$irmed; and in con|firming
it, has agreed with the &s;entiments
and anticipations of the good and wi$e in
every age. We are taught to believe, that
what we now behold, is only the fir&s;t &s;tage
of the life of man. We are arrived no
farther than the thre&s;hold; we dwell as in
the outer courts of exi&s;tence. Here, tents
only are pitched; tabernacles erected for
the $ojourners of a day. But in the re|gion
of eternity, all is great, &s;table, and un|changing.
There, the <HI>m$n&s;i$ns</HI> of the ju&s;t
are prepared: there, the <HI>City wh$$h $$th
$oundations</HI> is built; there is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
the kingdom <HI>w$i$h can$$t be m$$$d.</HI> Here,
every thing is in &s;tir and fluctuation;
becau&s;e here good men continue not, but
pa&s;s onward in the cour&s;e of being.
There, all is &s;erene, &s;teady and orderly;
becau&s;e there remaineth the final <HI>$e&s;t o$
the people of God.</HI> Here, all is corrupted
<PB N="269" REF="278">
by our folly and guilt; and of cour&s;e
mu&s;t be tran&s;ient and $ain. But there,
purcha&s;ed by the death, and &s;ecured by the
re$urrection of the Son of God, is an <HI>in$e|ritance
incorruptible, undefiled, and th$t $$deth
not away.</HI> There reigns that tranquillity
which is never troubled. There &s;hines that
&s;un which never &s;ets. There flows that ri|ver
of plea&s;ures, which is always unru$$led
and pure. Looking forward to tho&s;e di|vine
habitations, the changes of the pre|&s;ent
world di&s;appear to the eye of faith;
and a good man becomes a&s;hamed of &s;uf|fering
him&s;elf to be dejected by what is
&s;o &s;oon to pa&s;s away.</P>
<P>SUCH are the objects you ought to op|po&s;e
to the tran&s;ient <HI>fa&s;hion of the world;</HI>
Virtue, and God, and Heaven. Fixing
your regard on the&s;e, you will have no
rea&s;on to complain of the lot of man, or
the world's mutability.&mdash;The de&s;ign of
the preceding repre&s;entation which I gave
of the world, was not to indulge vain de|clamation;
to rai&s;e fruitle&s;s melancholy;
or to throw an unnece&s;&s;ary cloud over hu|man
<PB N="270" REF="279">
man life. But to &s;how the moderation
requi&s;ite in our attachment to the world;
and at the &s;ame time, to point out the
higher objects both of attention and con|&s;olation
which religion affords.&mdash;Pa&s;&s;|ing
and changeable as all human things
are, among them, however, we mu&s;t at
pre&s;ent act our part; to them we mu&s;t
return from religious meditation. They
are not below the regard of any Chri&s;tian;
for they form the &s;cene which providence
has appointed at pre&s;ent for his activity,
and his duty. Trials and dangers they
may often pre&s;ent to him; but amid&s;t
the&s;e he will &s;afely hold his cour&s;e, if,
when engaged in worldly affairs, he keep
in view tho&s;e divine objects which I have
been &s;etting before him. Let him ever
retain connection with Virtue, and God,
and Heaven. By them let his conduct be
regulated, and his con&s;tancy &s;upported.
So &s;hall he <HI>u&s;e this world</HI> without <HI>abu&s;ing

<P>TRANQUILLITY of mind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XIII.</NOTE> or, in the
words of the text, a mind <HI>not
moved</HI> or di&s;quieted by the accidents of
life, is undoubtedly one of the greate&s;t
ble&s;&s;ings that we can po&s;&s;e&s;s on earth.
It is here mentioned as the reward of the
man, who&s;e character had been de&s;cribed
in this p&s;alm, as leading a virtuous life,
and di&s;charging his duty towards God
<PB N="273" REF="282">
and his neighbour. It is indeed the ulti|mate
aim, to which the wi&s;hes of the wi&s;e
and reflecting have ever been directed,
that with a mind undi&s;turbed by anxieties,
cares, and fears, they might pa&s;s their
days in a plea&s;ing &s;erenity. They ju&s;tly
concluded that, by enjoying them&s;elves
in peace, they would enjoy, to the greate&s;t
advantage, all the comforts of life that
came within their reach.</P>
<P>This happy tranquillity, the multitude
conceive to be mo&s;t readily attainable by
means of wealth, or, at lea&s;t, of an ea&s;y
fortune; which they imagine would &s;et
them above all the ordinary di&s;turbances
of life. That it has &s;ome effect for this
purpo&s;e, cannot be denied. Poverty and
&s;traitened circum&s;tances are often incon|&s;i&s;tent
with tranquillity. To be de&s;titute
of tho&s;e conveniencies that &s;uit our rank
in the world; to be burdened with an|xiety
about making provi&s;ion for every
day which pa&s;&s;es over our head; in&s;tead of
bringing comfort to a family who look
up to us for aid, to behold our&s;elves &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="274" REF="283">
with their wants and com|plaints,
are circum&s;tances which cannot
fail to give much unea&s;ine&s;s to every feel|ing
mind. To take mea&s;ures, therefore,
for attaining a competent fortune, by lau|dable
means, is wi&s;e and proper. Entire
negligence of our affairs, and indifference
about our worldly circum&s;tances, is, for
the mo&s;t part, the con&s;equence of &s;ome
vice, or &s;ome folly.&mdash;At the &s;ame time, I
mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that the attainment of opu|lence
is no certain method of attaining
tranquillity. Embara&s;&s;ments and vexa|tions
often attend it; and long experience
has &s;hown, that tranquillity is far from be|ing
always found among the rich. Nay,
the higher that men ri&s;e in the world, the
greater degrees of power and di&s;tinction
which they acquire, they are often the far|ther
removed from internal peace. The
world affords &s;o many in&s;tances of mi&s;eries
abounding in the higher ranks of life,
that it were needle&s;s to enlarge on a topic
&s;o generally known and admitted.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="284">
A&s;&s;uming it, therefore, for an undoubt|ed
truth, that the mere po&s;&s;$&s;&s;ion of the
goods of fortune may be con&s;i&s;tent with
the want of inward tranquillity, we mu&s;t
look around for other more certain grounds
of it. We mu&s;t inquire whether any line
of conduct can be pointed out, which, in|dependent
of external &s;ituation in the
world, $hal$ tend to make us ea&s;y in mind;
&s;hall either be&s;tow, or aid, that tanquilli|ty
which all men de&s;ire. The remaining
part of this di&s;cour&s;e &s;hall be employed in
&s;ugge&s;ting, with great plainne&s;s of &s;peech,
&s;uch directions as appear to me mo&s;t mate|rial
on this important &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> direction, which I have to &s;ug|ge&s;t,
is, that we imitate the character of the
man who is de&s;cribed in this p&s;alm as
<HI>walking uprightly, working righteou&s;ne&s;s,
and &s;peaking the truth, as he thinketh in his
heart;</HI> that we &s;tudy to pre&s;erve a clear
con&s;cience, and to lead a virtuous and ho|nourable,
at lea&s;t an innoffen&s;ive and in|nocent,
life. Of &s;uch a man only it can
<PB N="276" REF="285">
be &s;aid, that <HI>doing the&s;e things he &s;hall ne|ver
be moved.</HI> So great is the power of
con&s;cience over every human being, that
the remembrance of crime$ never fails to
overthrow tranquillity of mind. Be a&s;|&s;ured,
that he who defrauds his neighbour,
who has en&s;nared the innocent, has viola|ted
this tru&s;t, or betrayed his friend, &s;hall
never enjoy within him&s;elf undi&s;turbed
quiet. His evil deeds will at times recur
to his thoughts, like gho&s;ts ri&s;ing up
in black array before him to haunt his
couch. Even the &s;en&s;e of a fooli&s;h and
trifling conduct, of a life pa&s;t in idlene&s;s
and di&s;&s;ipation; by which, though a man
has not been guilty of great crimes, he
has however wa&s;ted his &s;ub&s;tance, mi&s;pent
his time, and brought upon him&s;elf ju&s;t
reproach; even this, I &s;ay, is &s;ufficient to
create much unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;quiet to the
heart. Let him, therefore, who wi&s;hes to
enjoy tranquillity, &s;tudy, above all things,
to act an irreproachable part. With com|fort
he will re&s;t his head on his pillow at
night, when he is con&s;cious that through|out
<PB N="277" REF="286">
the day he has been doing his duty
towards God and man; when none of the
tran&s;actions of that day come back, in
painful remembrance, to upbraid him.
To this te&s;timony of a good con&s;cience, let
him be able.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, to join humble tru&s;t
in the favour of God. As, after the be&s;t
endeavours we can u&s;e, no man's beha|viour
will be entirely faultle&s;s, it is e&s;&s;en|tial
to peace of mind, that we have &s;ome
ground for hope in the Divine mercy,
that, through the merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
our defects &s;hall be forgiven, and grace
be &s;hewn us by Heaven. This includes
all the duties of faith and repentance that
are required by the Go&s;pel; the faithful
di&s;charge of which duties is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for delivering us from tho&s;e fears
of another world, which, if not allayed,
are &s;ufficient to bani&s;h all tranquillity from
the heart. Our religious principles mu&s;t
at the &s;ame time be &s;ound and pure; and
carefully pre&s;erved from the taint of &s;u|per&s;tition
<PB N="278" REF="287">
who&s;e gloomy horrors, taking
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of weak and ill informed minds,
convert what they mi&s;take for religion, in|to
a &s;ource of mi&s;ery.&mdash;Moreover, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
that we be able to place tru&s;t in
God, not only as our future Judge, but as
the pre&s;ent Governor of human affairs.
So uncertain is the continuance of every
earthly comfort, that he, who repo&s;es no
confidence in the Supreme Di&s;po&s;er of e|vents,
mu&s;t be often di&s;quieted and de|jected.
He alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es firm tranquil|lity,
who, amid&s;t all human vici&s;&s;itudes,
looks up, with &s;ettled tru&s;t, to an almighty
Ruler, as to one under who&s;e conduct he
is &s;afe. To him alone belongs that hap|py
privilege, de&s;cribed by the P$almi&s;t:
<HI>He &s;hall not be a$raid of evil ti$ings; his
heart is fixed; tru&s;ting in the Lord</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm cxii. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I have pointed out the primary and e&s;|&s;ential
foundations of tranquillity; virtuous
conduct, good principles, and pious di&s;|po&s;itions.
<PB N="279" REF="288">
At the &s;ame time, a man may
be both pious and virtuous, and yet,
through &s;ome defects in the management
of his mind and temper, may not po&s;&s;e&s;s
that happy &s;erenity and &s;elf-enioyment,
which ought to be the portion of virtue
and piety. In&s;tances of this will occur to
every one who is acquainted with the world.
We too often behold per&s;ons, who&s;e prin|ciples,
and who&s;e moral conduct, are in the
main unexceptionable, leading an uncom|fortable
life; through fretfulne&s;s of temper,
peevi&s;hne&s;s of manners, or $ullenne&s;s of
di&s;po&s;ition. There is, therefore, &s;ome di&s;|cipline
to be &s;tudied; there are &s;ome &s;ub&s;i|diary
parts of character to be attended to,
in order to give piety and virtue their full
effect for conferring tranquillity. To the
con&s;ideration of the&s;e &s;econdary means I
now proceed. Let me then advi&s;e you,</P>
<P>In the <HI>third</HI> place, to attend to the cul|ture
and improvement of your minds.
A fund of u&s;eful knowledge, and a &s;tock
of ideas, afford much advantage for the
<PB N="280" REF="289">
enjoyment of tranquillity. I do not mean,
that every man mu&s;t &s;tudy to become
deeply learned. The &s;ituation of many
would not allow it. The ta&s;te, and the
habits of others, prevent it. But what I
mean is, that every man who wi&s;hes to
lead a comfortable life &s;hould provide for
him&s;elf, as much as he can, by means of
ob&s;ervation, reading, and reflecting, a
large field of u&s;eful thoughts. In a mind
ab&s;olutely vacant, tranquillity is &s;eldom
found. The vacancy too often will be
filled up by bad de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions.
Whereas, the mind of a wi&s;e man is a
kingdom to it&s;elf. In his lonely, or me|lancholy
hours, he finds always re&s;ources
within him&s;elf, to which he can turn for
relief. As there are many occa&s;ions when
external objects afford no plea&s;ure, it is
only by being able to re&s;t on the enter|tainments
afforded to him&s;elf by his
mind, that any one can pa&s;s his days with
&s;$lf-enjoyment. Let me recomment for
the &s;ame purpo&s;e,</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="290">
In the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that we be always
careful to provide proper employment for
our time. Regular indu&s;try and labour,
with intervals of ea&s;e, is perhaps the &s;tate
mo&s;t conducive of any to tranquillity. If
our &s;tation give no call to indu&s;try, it will
be profitable that we &s;tudy to have &s;ome
end or object in view, to which our atten|tion
&s;hall be directed. Relaxation from
inten&s;e, or ince&s;&s;ant pur&s;uit, is requi&s;ite for
comfort. But if relaxation degenerate
into total idlene&s;s, it becomes in a high
degreee adver&s;e to tranquillity. Every
man by his nature, is formed, more
or le&s;s, for action. In a mind that is en|tirely
quie&s;cent, and that has no object to
put in into motion, in&s;tead of &s;elf-enjoy|ment,
there will be con&s;tant languor, te|diou&s;ne&s;s,
and mi&s;ery. Life &s;tagnates in
&s;uch a &s;ituation, like a pool of dead waters;
and the man becomes a burden to him|&s;elf.
Violent and dangerous pur&s;uits,
which di&s;tract and embroil tho&s;e who are
engaged in them, I cannot be under&s;tood
to recommend. Every on &s;ees how fo|reign
<PB N="282" REF="291">
the&s;e are to a &s;tate of tranquillity.
But in the ordinary tenor of calm and
ea&s;y life, I would advi&s;e every one to have
&s;ome end before him; &s;ome object which
&s;hall bring the mind into action, and fill
up the vacuities of time. Provided the
object be innocent, and of no un&s;uitable
or degrading nature, it may an&s;wer this
purpo&s;e, though it &s;hould not be in it&s;elf
of high importance. It is better for the
mind to have &s;ome determinate direction
given it, than to be always left floating, as
it were, in empty &s;pace.&mdash;But about what|ever
objects we are employed, it is &s;till
more material to tranquillity that, in the</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> place, we learn to govern our pa&s;|&s;ions.
The&s;e are the mo&s;t frequent di&s;|turbers
of our peace. Nece&s;&s;ary as their
impul&s;e is to give activity to the mind,
yet if they are not kept in &s;ubordination
to rea&s;on, they &s;peedily throw all things
into confu&s;ion. Such of them as belong
to the malignant and un&s;ocial cla&s;s, evi|dently
tend to produce vexation and di&s;|$uiet.
Again&s;t &s;uffering the&s;e to gain
<PB N="283" REF="292">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart, admonition is
&s;carcely nece&s;&s;ary. But I mu&s;t admoni&s;h
you, that even tho&s;e which are accounted
of innocent nature, and which therefore
may lay hold of virtuous minds, if they
obtain the entire ma&s;tery, are &s;ufficient to
overthrow the tranquillity of life. Let
every one, therefore, who values that tran|quillity,
&s;tudy to retain moderation and
&s;elf-command, even in the mid&s;t of pa&s;|&s;ions
which have a fair and bland appear|ance.
He will find that the grati$ication
of any one of them, compen&s;ates not that
perpetual &s;lavery to which it will reduce
him, when it becomes inordinate.</P>
<P>I have farther to admoni&s;h you, that
this &s;elf-command is particularly nece&s;&s;a|ry
in all that relates to habitual temper.
Even where &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions are out of the
que&s;tion, tho&s;e &s;lighter emotions which
ruffle or &s;our the temper, are &s;ufficient, by
their frequent recurrence, to poi&s;on all
&s;elf-enjoyment. He who would po&s;&s;e&s;s a
tranquil &s;tate, mu&s;t, above all things, cul|tivate
calmne&s;s and gentlene&s;s of di&s;po&s;i|tion.
<PB N="284" REF="293">
He ought e&s;pecially to cultivate it in
that &s;ociety, whether dome&s;tic or &s;ocial, with
which he has mo&s;t frequent intercour&s;e.
We all know, that there are thou&s;ands who
in public, and in formal companies, appear
to be all gentlene&s;s and &s;weetne&s;s, but
who, at home, and among their neare&s;t
relations, give vent, with freedom, to the
mo&s;t har&s;h and peevi&s;h di&s;po&s;itions. Such
per&s;ons are not likely to enjoy much real
comfort. For it is in the daily and fami|liar
intercour&s;e of life, that temper chief|ly
exerts its power, either for promoting
or for di&s;turbing, the tranquillity of our
days. On occa&s;ions when men come clo&s;|e&s;t
together$ if, in&s;tead of meeting in
&s;mooth contact, they rub and grate on
one another, the feelings produced on
both &s;ides are of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive and
di&s;plea&s;ing kind. Nothing can be a&s;&s;um|ed
as a more certain axiom, than that he
who allows either inordinate pa&s;&s;ions, or
a cro&s;s temper, to govern him, mu&s;t,
though he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s all that flouri&s;h|ing
<PB N="285" REF="294">
fortune can be&s;tow, be a &s;tranger to
tranquillity.</P>
<P><HI>In the &s;ixth</HI> place, let me advi&s;e you ne|ver
to expect too much from the world.
High hopes, and florid views, are great e|nemies
to tranquillity. When ra&s;hly in|dulged,
they are con&s;tantly producing
di&s;appointments. Their indulgence, in the
mean time, occa&s;ions di&s;content with our
pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and he who is di&s;con|tented
cannot be happy. One of the fir&s;t
le&s;&s;ons, both of religion and of wi&s;dom, is,
to moderate our expectations and hopes;
and not to &s;et forth on the voyage of life
like men who expect to be always carried
forward with a favourable gale. Let your
views be &s;uited to your rank and &s;tation
in the world; and never &s;oar fanta&s;tical|ly
beyond them. Content your&s;elves with
&s;ober plea&s;ures, and form your reli&s;h to
them. Be thankful when you are free
from pain, though you be not in the
mid&s;t of high enjoyment. Be &s;atisfied if
the path you tread be ea&s;y and &s;mooth,
<PB N="286" REF="295">
though it be not &s;trewed with flowers.
Human life admits not of continued plea|&s;ure;
nor is it always rendered happy by
great exaltation. Remember, that it is a
middle region which is the native &s;tation
of tranquillity. It neither a&s;pires to tho&s;e
heights of the atmo&s;phere where the thun|der
is formed; nor creeps always on the
ground. Affect not, on every occa&s;ion, to
put your&s;elves forward. Be content to
retire &s;ometimes into the &s;hade; and al|low
others to take their proper place.&mdash;It
will be ea&s;ily &s;een, that I &s;peak not now
to the ambitious and a&s;piring; but to
tho&s;e who value tranquillity more than
&s;plendid appearance in the world.</P>
<P>Such per&s;ons I al&s;o advi&s;e, while they
expect not too much from the world,
neither, al&s;o, to form too high expecta|tions
from the characters of tho&s;e on
who&s;e friend&s;hip they re&s;t, and with
whom it is their lot to be connected, ei|ther
in &s;ocial or dome&s;tic relations. If
you have looked for perfection any where,
you will find your&s;elf di&s;appointed; and
<PB N="287" REF="296">
the con&s;equence of this di&s;appointment
will be, that friend&s;hip will cool, and di&s;|gu&s;t
&s;ucceed. If you wi&s;h to enjoy com|fort
in any of your connections, take
your fellow-creatures as they are, and
look for their imperfections to appear.
You know you have your own; bear with
tho&s;e of others, as you expect that they
are to bear with you. As no one is with|out
his failings, few al&s;o are void of ami|able
qualities. Select for your compa|nions,
tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t &s;hare
of &s;uch qualities; and value them accord|ingly.
&mdash;In a word, make the be&s;t of this
world as you find it. Reckon both on
the &s;tate of human life, and on the &s;ociety
of men, as mixed, and checquered with
good and evil. Carrying always in your
eye &s;uch views of things, you will be be&s;t
formed to tho&s;e equal &s;pirits, and that
rea&s;onable di&s;po&s;ition of mind, which
make the ba&s;is of tranquillity. I &s;hall
only add as my</P>
<P><HI>Seventh,</HI> and la&s;t advice on the &s;ubject,
<PB N="288" REF="297">
to mix retreat with the active bu&s;ine&s;s
of the world, and to cultivate habits of
&s;erious thought and recollection. I before
advi&s;ed tho&s;e who are not particularly en|gaged
in active life, to form to them&s;elves
&s;ome object of pur&s;uit, in order to fur|ni&s;h
proper employment to time and
thought. But the great multitude of men
are in a different &s;ituation. Indu&s;try is re|quired
of them; bu&s;ine&s;s and cares pre&s;s;
and active pur&s;uits occupy their clo&s;e&s;t at|tention.
He, who, in this &s;ituation, pours
him&s;elf forth ince&s;&s;antly on the world, can|not
e&s;cape partaking much of its di&s;turb|ance
and trouble. Amid&s;t bu&s;tle, in|trigue
and di&s;fen&s;ion, he mu&s;t pa&s;s many
an unea&s;y hour. Here an enemy en|counters
him; there, a rival meets him.
A &s;u&s;picious friend alarms him one hour;
an ungrateful one provokes him the next.
I do not recommend, that for the&s;e rea|&s;ons,
he who &s;tudies tranquillity &s;hould
retire from all public bu&s;ine&s;s, and for|&s;ake
the haunts of men. This were the
retreat of a monk, not of a good and a
<PB N="289" REF="298">
wi&s;e man. Tranquillity were too dearly
purcha&s;ed by the neglect of tho&s;e duties
which belong to a man, and a Chri&s;tian.
Nor indeed in ab&s;olute &s;eclu&s;ion from the
world is tranquillity ever found. On the
contrary, when the human mind is cut off
from tho&s;e employments for which it was
de&s;igned by nature and Providence, it
preys on it&s;elf, and engenders its own mi|&s;ery.
Tranquillity is always mo&s;t likely
to be attained, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the
world is tempered with thoughtful and
&s;erious retreat. <HI>Commune with your hearts
on your bed, and be &s;till.</HI> Leaving this world
to it&s;elf, let there be &s;ea&s;ons which you
devote to your&s;elves, and to God. Reflec|tion
and meditation allay the workings of
many unquiet pa&s;&s;ions; and place us at a
di&s;tance from the tumults of the world.
When the mind has either been ruffled or
ca&s;t down, in intercour&s;e with God and
heaven we find a &s;anctuary to which we
can retreat. In the hours of contempla|tion
and devotion, a good man enjoys
him&s;elf in peace. He beholds nobler ob|jects
<PB N="290" REF="299">
than what worldly men can b$ hold.
He a&s;&s;umes a higher character. He $$|tens
to the voice of nature and of God;
and from this holy &s;anctuary comes forth
with a mind fortified again&s;t the little di&s;|turbances
of the world. Such habit$
therefore, cannot be too much recommend|ed
to the lovers of tranquillity, as power|ful
&s;ub&s;idiary means for attaining that
happy &s;tate.</P>
<P>I HAVE thus pointed out what appears
to me the di&s;cipline of religion and wi&s;|dom
for tranquillity of mind. <HI>He that
doth the&s;e things &s;hall never be moved.</HI>&mdash;During
the early periods of life, vivid &s;$n|&s;ations
of plea&s;ure are the &s;ole objects
thought wo$thy of pur&s;uit. Mere ea&s;e and
calmne&s;s are de&s;pi&s;ed, as the portion of
the aged only and the feeble. Some long|er
acquaintance with the world, with its
di&s;appointed hopes and fallacious pl$$|&s;ures,
teaches almo&s;t all men, by degrees,
to wi&s;h for tranquillity and peace. But
you mu&s;t not imagine, that the&s;e are ble&s;|&s;ings
<PB N="291" REF="300">
which will drop on men of their own
accord, as &s;oon as they begin to de&s;ire
them. No: The thoughtle&s;s, and the
profligate, will ever remain &s;trangers to
them. They will remain the &s;port of every
accident that occurs to derange their minds,
and to di&s;turb their life.&mdash;The three
great enemies to tranquillity are, Vice,
Super&s;tition, and Idlene&s;s: Vice, which
poi&s;ons and di&s;turbs the mind with bad
pa&s;&s;ions; Super&s;tition, which fills it with
imaginary t$rrors; Idlene&s;s, which loads
it with tediou&s;ne&s;s and di&s;gu&s;t. It is only
by following the path which Eternal Wi&s;|dom
has pointed out, that we can arrive
at the ble&s;&s;ed temple of Tranquillity, and
obtain a &s;tation there: By doing, or at
lea&s;t endeavouring to do, our duty to God
and man; by acquiring a humble tru&s;t
in the mercy and favour of God through
Je&s;us Chri&s;t; by cultivating our minds,
and properly employing our time and
thoughts; by governing our pa&s;&s;ions and
our temper; by correcting all unrea&s;on|able
expectations from the world, and from
<PB N="292" REF="301">
men; and, in the mid&s;t of worldly $word$,
habituating our&s;elves to calm retreat
and &s;erious recollection.&mdash;By &s;uch means
as the&s;e, it may be hoped, that, through
the divine ble&s;&s;ing, our days, &s;hall flow in
a &s;tream as unruffled as the human &s;tate
admits. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled
&s;ea, when it cannot re&s;t. But the work of

I. Let us con&s;ider the external condi|tion
of man. We find him placed in a
world, where he has by no means the di&s;|po&s;al
of the events that happen. Calami|ties
&s;ometimes befal the worthie&s;t and the
be&s;t, which it is not in their power to pre|vent,
and where nothing is loft them, but
to acknowledge and to &s;ubmit to the high
hand of Heaven. For &s;uch vi&s;itations of
trial, many good and wi&s;e rea&s;ons can be
a&s;&s;igned, which the pre&s;ent &s;ubject leads
me not to di&s;cu&s;s. But though tho&s;e una|voidable
calamities make a part, yet they
make not the chief part, of the vexations
and &s;orrows that di&s;tre&s;s human life. A
multitude of evils be&s;et us, for the &s;ource
of which we mu&s;t look to another quar|ter.
&mdash;No &s;ooner has any thing in the
health, or in the circum&s;tances of men,
gone cro&s;s to their wi&s;h, than they begin
to talk of the unequal di&s;tribution of the
good things of this life; they envy the
condition of others; they repine at their
own lot, and fret again&s;t the Ruler of the
world.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="305">
Full of the&s;e &s;entiments, one man pines
under a broken con&s;titution. But let us

unknown decree of heaven? Has he du|ly
valued the ble&s;&s;ing of health, and al|ways

Has he been moderate in his life,
and temperate in all his pleas&s;ures? If now
he be only paying the price of his former,
perhaps his forgotten, indulgences, has
he any title to complain, as if he were
&s;uffering unju&s;tly? Were you to &s;urvey
the chambers of &s;ickne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, you

you, for bettering and advancing your
&s;tate? If you have cho&s;en to indulge your
humour, or your ta&s;te, in the gratifica|tions
of indolence or plea&s;ure, can you
complain becau&s;e others, in preference to
you, have obtained tho&s;e advantages
which naturally belong to u&s;eful labours,

and honourable pur&s;uits? have not the
con&s;equences of &s;ome fal&s;e &s;teps, into
which your pa&s;&s;ions, or your plea&s;ures,
have betrayed you, pur&s;ued you through
much of your life; tainted perhaps, your
character, involved you in embara&s;&s;ments,
or &s;unk you into neglect?&mdash;It is an old
&s;aying, that every man is the artificer of
his own fortune in the world. It is cer|tain,
that the world &s;eldom turns wholly
again&s;t a man, unle&s;s through his own
fault. <HI>Godline&s;s is,</HI> in general, <HI>profitable

joined with good temper and pru|dence,
have ever been found the &s;ure&s;t
road to pro&s;perity; and where men fail
of attaining it, their want of &s;ucce&s;s is
for oftener owing to their having deviat|ed
from that road, than to their hav|ing
encountered in&s;uperable bars in it.
Some, by being too artful, forfeit the re|putation
of probity. Some, by being too
open, are accounted to fail in prudence.
Others, by being fickle and changeable,
are di&s;tru&s;ted by all.&mdash;The ca&s;e com|monly
<PB N="299" REF="308">
is, that men &s;eek to a&s;cribe their
$$$&s;appointments to any cau&s;e, rather than
to their own mi&s;conduct; and when they
can devi&s;e no other cau&s;e, they lay them
to the charge of Providence. Their folly
leads them into vices; their vices into
misfortunes; and in their misfortunes
they <HI>&s;ret again&s;t the Lord.</HI> They are
doubly unju&s;t towards God. In their pro|&s;perity,
they are apt to a&s;cribe their &s;uc|ce&s;s
to their own diligence, rather than to
God's ble&s;&s;ing; and in their adver&s;ity,
they impute their distre&s;&s;es to his provi|dence,
not to their own mi&s;behaviour.
whereas, the truth is the very rever&s;e of
this. <HI>Every good and every perfect gift
cometh from above;</HI> and of evil and mi&s;e|ry,
man is the author to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>When from the condition of indivi|duals,
we look abroad to the public &s;tate
of the world, we meet with more proofs
of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. We &s;ee
great &s;ocieties of men torn in pieces by
inte&s;tine di&s;&s;en&s;ions, tumults, and civil
commotions. We &s;ee mighty armies go|ing
<PB N="300" REF="309">
forth, in formidable array, again&s;t
each other, to cover the earth with blood,
and to fill the air with the cries of widow,
and orphans. Sad evils the&s;e are, to
which this mi&s;erable world is expo&s;ed.
&mdash;But are the&s;e evils, I be&s;eech you,
to be imputed to God? Was it he who
&s;ent forth &s;laughtering armies into the
field, or who filled the peaceful city with
ma&s;&s;acres and blood? Are the&s;e mi&s;eries
any other, than the bitter fruit of mens
violent and di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions? Are they
not clearly to be traced to the ambition
and vices of princes, to the quarrels of
the great, and to the turbulence of the
people?&mdash;Let us lay them entirely out
of the account, in thinking of Providence;
and let us think only of the <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s of
men.</HI> Did man controul his pa&s;&s;ions, and
form his conduct according to the dic|tates

by cruelty; and human &s;ocieties would
live in order, harmony and peace. In
tho&s;e &s;cenes of mi&s;chief and violence
<PB N="301" REF="310">
which fill the world, let man behold, with
&s;hame, the picture of his vices, his ingno|rance,
and folly. Let him be humbled
by the mortifying view of his own <HI>per|ver&s;ene&s;s;</HI>
but let not <HI>his heart fret again&s;t
the Lord.</HI>&mdash;Form the external condition,
let us proceed.</P>
<P>II. To con&s;ider the internal &s;tate of
man. It is certain that much di&s;quiet
and mi&s;ery may be found there, although
his outward condition appear undi&s;turb|ed,
and ea&s;y. As far as this inward di&s;|quietude
ari&s;es from the &s;tings of con|&s;cience,
and the horrors of guilt, there
can be no doubt of its being &s;elf-created
mi&s;ery; which it is altogether impo&s;&s;ible
to impute to Heaven. But even, when
great crimes, and deep remor&s;e, are not
the occa&s;ions of torment, how often is
poi&s;on infu&s;ed into the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing
conditions of fortune, by the follies and
the pa&s;&s;ions of the pro&s;perous? we &s;ee
them peevi&s;h and re&s;tle&s; corrupted with
luxury, and enervated by ca&s;e; impatient
<PB N="302" REF="311">
of the &s;malle&s;t di&s;appointment; oppre&s;&s;ed
with low &s;pirits, and complaining of eve|ry
thing around them. How many <HI>Ha|mans,
Hazaels, and herods,</HI> are there in
the world, who, form what they &s;uffer
within, pa&s;s their days in more vexation
and mi&s;ery, than they who undergo the
hard&s;hips of poverty? Dare &s;uch men, in
their mo&s;t di&s;contented moments, charge
the providence of heaven with mi&s;eries
of their own procuring? Providence had
put into their hand the faire&s;t opportu|nity
of pa&s;&s;ing their life with comfort.
But they them&s;elves bla&s;ted every com|fort
that was offered; and verified the
prediction, that <HI>the pro&s;perity of fools &s;hall
de&s;troy them</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 32.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As it is man's own <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s</HI> which
ruins his pro&s;perity, we mu&s;t not omit to
remark, that it is the &s;ame cau&s;e which
aggravates and embitters his adver&s;ity.
That you &s;uffer from the external af|flictions
<PB N="303" REF="312">
of the world, may often be ow|ing
to God's appointment; but when, in
the mid&s;t of the&s;e, you al&s;o &s;uffer from
the di&s;orders of your mind and pa&s;&s;ions,
this is owing to your&s;elves; and they are
tho&s;e inward di&s;orders which add the &s;e|vere&s;t
&s;ting to external afflictions. Many
are the re&s;ources of a good and a wi&s;e man,
under all the di&s;a&s;ters of life. In the mid&s;t
of them, it is always in his power to en|joy
peace of mind, and hope in God. He
may &s;uffer; but under &s;uffering he will
not &s;ink, as long as all is found within.
But when the &s;pirit has been wounded by
guilt and folly, its wounds open, bleed
a fre&s;h, upon every blow that is received
from the world. The mind becomes
&s;en&s;ible and &s;ore to the flighte&s;t injuries of
fortune; and a &s;mall rever&s;e is felt as an
in&s;upportable calamity.</P>
<P>On the whole; the farther you &s;earch into
human life, and the more you ob&s;erve the
manners and the conduct of men, you will
be the more convinced of this great truth,
that of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es which abound in the
<PB N="304" REF="313">
world, we are the chief authors. Among
the multitudes who are, at this day, bewail|ing
their condition and lot, it will be found
to hold of far the greater part, that they
are reaping the <HI>fruit of their own doings;
their inequities are reproving them, and their
black&s;lidings correcting them.</HI> Unattainable
objects fooli&s;hly pur&s;ued, intemperate pa&s;|&s;ions
nouri&s;hed, vicious plea&s;ures and de|&s;ires
indulged, God and God's holy laws for|gotten;
the&s;e, the&s;e are the great &s;courges
of the world; the great cau&s;es of the life
of man being &s;o embroiled and unhappy.
God hath ordained our &s;tate on earth to
be a mixed and imperfect &s;tate. we have
our&s;elves to blame for its becoming an in|&s;upportable
one. If it bring forth nothing
to us but vexation and vanity, we have
&s;own the &s;eeds of that vanity and vexa|tion;
and as we have &s;own, we mu&s;t reap.
&mdash;I now proceed to make improvement of
tho&s;e truths which we have been con&s;ider|ing.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let us be taught, to
<PB N="305" REF="314">
look upon &s;in as the &s;ource of all our mi|&s;eries.
It may &s;ometimes a&s;&s;ume the gent|ler
names of folly, irregularity, or levity;
but under whatever form it appears, it
always imports a deviation from that &s;a|cred
law which ought to regulate our
conduct. It is &s;till the <HI>root that beareth
gall and wormwood</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxix. 18.</NOTE>; and in exact pro|portion
to the quantity of this poi&s;onous
weed, which we our&s;elves have infu&s;ed in|to
our cup, we mu&s;t expect to drink the
waters of bitterne&s;s. If the <HI>fooli&s;hne&s;s of
man</HI> did not <HI>pervert his ways,</HI> his heart
would have no occa&s;ion to <HI>fret again&s;t the
Lord.</HI> He would enjoy competent &s;ati&s;|faction
in every &s;ituation of life; and un|der
its unavoidable evils, would derive
con&s;olation from religion and virtue.&mdash;
Indeed, of every evil which we now en|dure.,
of tho&s;e evils which we look upon
to be the appointment of providence, as
well as of others, &s;in is ultimately the
cau&s;e; as it was man's revolt from God,
<PB N="306" REF="315">
which gave ri&s;e originally to tho&s;e evils,
and which rendered the cha&s;ti&s;ements we
undergo, in this &s;tate of di&s;cipline, nece&s;&s;a|ry,
even for the <HI>&s;ons of God.</HI>&mdash;But at
pre&s;ent, we confine our ob&s;ervation to
tho&s;e mi&s;eries of which men are the im|mediate
procurers to them&s;elves; and
from them alone, we find &s;ufficient
rea&s;on to con&s;ider &s;in as the capital foe
to man; as the great troubler and di&s;|turber
of his life. To Providence, then,
let us look up with reverence. On &s;in let
our indignation be vented; and, what is
of more con&s;equence, again&s;t &s;in and all
its approaches, let our utmo&s;t caution be
employed. As we proceed through the
different paths of life, let us accu&s;tom our|&s;elves
to beware of &s;in, as the hidden
&s;nake lurking among the gra&s; from
who&s;e fatal touch we mu&s;t fly in ha&s;te,
if we would not experience its &s;ting.&mdash;
Too many have no ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of
this danger. <HI>Fools,</HI> &s;aid the wi&s;e man,
<HI>make a mock at &s;in.</HI> A fool indeed he mu&s;t
be, who dares to think lightly of it. He
&s;hows not only the depravity of his heart,
<PB N="307" REF="316">
but, what perhaps he will be more a&s;ham|ed
to be charged with, he &s;hows his ig|norance
of the world. He &s;hows that he
knows not, he under&s;tands not, even his
worldly intere&s;t, nor the intere&s;t and hap|pine&s;s
of human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, let us learn from
what has been &s;et forth, one of the mo&s;t
awful and important of all truths, the re|ality
of a divine government exerci&s;ed o|ver
the world. Blind mu&s;t that man, be
who di&s;cerns not the mo&s;t &s;triking marks
of it, in the doctrine which has been un|der
our review. If there be a &s;ceptic, who
contends, that unre&s;trained liberty in the
gratification of de&s;ire is given to man;
that in the &s;ight of his Creator, all actions
are equal; and that no rule of moral con|duct
hath been pre&s;cribed, or by any pe|nalty
enforced; in order to confute &s;uch
a man, we have not recour&s;e to rea&s;on|ings,
but &s;imply appeal to plain and ob|vious
facts. we bid him look only to
the life of man; and take notice how e|very
vice, is by the con&s;titution of things,
<PB N="308" REF="317">
connected with mi&s;ery. We bid him
trace the hi&s;tory of any one, with who&s;e
conduct he had particular occa&s;ion to be
acquainted; and ob&s;erve, whether the chief
misfortunes which pur&s;ued him were not
brought upon him by his own mi&s;beha|viour.
We bid him remark in the hi&s;to|ry
of nations, whether public virtue has
not always exalted them; and whether
licentiou&s;ne&s;s and crimes have not paved
the way for their ruin. The&s;e are te&s;ti|monies
to the truth of religion, which can|not
by any &s;ophi&s;try be evaded. This
is a voice, which &s;peaks its warnings loud
and &s;trong to every heart.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem upon which the divine go|vernment
at pre&s;ent proceeds, plainly is,
that mens <HI>own wickedne&s;s</HI> &s;hould be ap|pointed
to <HI>correct them;</HI> that &s;inners
&s;hould <HI>be $word$ in the work of their hands,
and &s;unk in the pit which them&s;elves had
digged; that the back&s;lider in heart should
be filled with his own ways.</HI>&mdash;Of all the
plans which could have been devi&s;ed for
the government of the world, this ap|proves
<PB N="309" REF="318">
it&s;elf to rea&s;on, as the wi&s;e&s;t and
mo&s;t worthy of God;&s;o to frame the
con&s;titution of things, that the divine laws
&s;hould in a manner execute them&s;elves,
and carry their &s;anctions in their own bo|&s;om.
When the vices of men require pu|ni&s;hment
to be inflicted, the Almighty is
at no lo&s;s for mini&s;ters of ju&s;tice. A
thou&s;and in&s;truments of vengeance are at
his command; innumerable arrows are
always in his quiver. But &s;uch is the
profound wi&s;dom of his plan, that no pe|culiar
interpo&s;als of power are requi&s;ite.
He has no occa&s;ion to &s;tep from his throne,
and to interrupt the order of nature.
With that Maje&s;ty and &s;olemnity which
befits omnipotence, He pronounces, <HI>Eph|raim
is joined to his idols; let him alone</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ho&s;ea. Iv. 17.</NOTE>;
He leaves tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors to their own guilt,
and puni&s;hment follows of cour&s;e. Their
&s;ins do the work of ju&s;tice. They lift the
&s;courge; and with every &s;troke which
<PB N="310" REF="319">
they inflict on the criminal, they mix this
&s;evere admonition, that as he is only reap|ing
the fruit of his own actions, he de|&s;erves
all that he &s;uffers.&mdash;From what
has been &s;aid, I might take occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Third</HI> place, to &s;how the inju&s;tice
of our charging Providence with a pro|mi&s;cuous
and unequal di&s;tribution of its
favours, among the good and the bad.
That unequal di&s;tribution takes place in
appearance only, not in reality. The
whole conduct of Providence &s;ufficiently
marks, which of tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of men it
ble&s;&s;es and protects. The pro&s;perity of
&s;inners is no more than a deceitful &s;how.
The great materials of happine&s;s are pro|vided
for the virtuous; and <HI>evil</HI> never
fails to <HI>pur&s;ue the wicked.</HI> I &s;hall clo&s;e the
di&s;cour&s;e with ob&s;erving,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> and la&s;t place, the nece&s;&s;i|ty
which plainly ari&s;es from our pre&s;ent
condition, of looking up to God for direc|tion
and aid, in the conduct of life. The
<PB N="311" REF="320">
re&s;ult of the whole doctrine I have now
delivered is, that man's happine&s;s or mi&s;e|ry
is, in a great mea&s;ure, put into his own
hands. In vain he complains of Provi|dence.
If his <HI>heart fret again&s;t the Lord,</HI> it
is only becau&s;e <HI>his fooli&s;hne&s;s hath perverted
his way;</HI> for on him&s;elf, and his own be|haviour,
it depends, to be free of tho&s;e mi|&s;eries
which harra&s;s the wicked.&mdash;But a|las!
when we &s;ay, that this depends upon
man, on what uncertain ground do we
place his &s;ecurity? Is man, when left to
him&s;elf, equal to this high tru&s;t that is re|po&s;ed
in him, this important charge that
is committed to him, of attaining happi|ne&s;s,
by wi&s;e and irreproachable conduct?
Incon&s;tant as he is in virtue, variable in
his re&s;olutions, &s;oft and yielding in his
nature to a thou&s;and temptations; how
&s;hall he guide him&s;elf through &s;uch &s;lip|pery
and dangerous paths as tho&s;e of hu|man
life; where many hidden precipices
&s;urround him; many fal&s;e lights lead him
a&s;tray; and where the con&s;equence of eve|ry
&s;tep he takes may be de&s;truction and
<PB N="312" REF="321">
ruin?&mdash;Thankful let us be to heaven,
that in this &s;ituation, a merciful guide
&s;tretches out his hand to aid us; that a
cele&s;tial light &s;hines upon us from above;
that a divine Spirit is promi&s;ed to illumi|nate
and &s;trenythen us. let us humbly re|que&s;t
of Heaven, that this Spirit of the Al|mighty
may ever be our guide; never pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly
tru&s;ting in our own wi&s;dom;
but li&s;tening attentively to the voice of God;
and <HI>in all our ways acknowledging Him</HI> who
only can <HI>direct our &s;teps</HI>&mdash;Upon the whole,
let us hold fa&s;t the per&s;ua&s;ion of the&s;e
fundamental truths;&mdash;that in all his di&s;|pen&s;ations,
God is ju&s;t and good; that the
cau&s;e of all the troubles we &s;uffer is in
our&s;elves, not in him; that virtue is the
&s;ure&s;t guide to a happy life; that he who
for&s;akes this guide, enters upon the path
of death; but that he who <HI>walketh up|rightly,
walketh &s;urely;</HI> and that he who
<HI>keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own
&s;oul.</HI></P>

walks are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s,</HI> while <HI>the

as attending the one, while
<PB N="314" REF="323">
&s;hame is the portion of the other. The
path of the one leads to life; that of the
other to de&s;truction. In the text, an ad|vantage
of righteousne&s;s is &s;pecified,
which is not commonly attended to, and
which &s;ome will not readily allow that it
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. We are told by the wi&s;e man,
that it affords light and direction to con|duct,
and will prove our be&s;t guide
through all the intricacies of life. <HI>The
integrity of the upright &s;hall guide them;</HI> or,
as it is added, to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, in a fol|lowing
ver&s;e, <HI>the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the perfect

will admit, that integrity is an amiable qua|lity;
that it is entitled to much re&s;pect, and
in mo&s;t ca&s;es ought to influence our beha|viour;
who neverthele&s;s are unwilling to
allow it the chief place in the direction of
their worldly conduct. They hold, that
a certain artful &s;agacity, founded upon
knowledge of the world, is the be&s;t con|ductor
of every one, who would be as &s;uc|ce&s;sful
adventurer in life; and that a &s;trict
attention to integrity, as his only guide,
<PB N="315" REF="324">
would often lead him into danger and di&s;|tre&s;s.
In oppo&s;ition to tenets of this
kind, I now purpo&s;e to &s;how, that amid&s;t
all perplexities and dangers, there is no
guide we can chu&s;e &s;o &s;afe, and &s;o &s;ucce&s;s|ful
on the whole, as the integrity of an
upright mind; and that upon every try|ing
occa&s;ion, principles of probity and ho|nour
will conduct a good man through
life with more advantage, than if he were
to act upon the mo&s;t refined &s;y&s;tem of
worldly wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>IT will not take much time to delineate
the character of the man of integrity, as
by its nature it is a plain one, and ea&s;ily
under&s;tood. He is one, who makes it his
con&s;tant rule to follow the road of duty,
according as the word of God, and the
voice of his con&s;cience, point it out to him.
He is not guided merely by affections,
which may &s;ometimes give the colour of
virtue to a loo&s;e and un&s;table character.
The upright man is guided by a fixed
principle of a mind, which determines him
<PB N="316" REF="325">
to e&s;teem nothing but what is honour|able;
and to abhor whatever is ba&s;e and
unworthy, in moral conduct. Hence you
find him ever the &s;ame; at all times, the
tru&s;ty friend, the affectionate relation, the
con&s;cientious man of bu&s;ine&s;s, the pious
wor&s;hipper, the public &s;pirited citizen.
He a&s;&s;umes no borrowed appearance. He
&s;eeks no ma&s;k to cover him; for he acts
no &s;tudied part; but he is in truth what
he appears to be, full of truth, candour,
and humanity. In all his pur&s;uits, he
knows no path but the fair and direct
one; and would much rather fail of &s;uc|ce&s;s;
than attain it by reproachful means.
He never &s;hows you a &s;miling counte|nance,
while he meditates evil again&s;t
you in his heart. He never prai&s;es you
among your friends; and then joins in
traducing you among your enemies. You
will never find one part of his character
at variance with another. In his man|ners,
he is &s;imple and unaffected; in all his
proceedings, open and con&s;i&s;tent.&mdash;Such is
the man of integrity &s;poken of in the
<PB N="317" REF="326">
text. Let us now proceed to &s;how, in what
manner, and with what effect, integrity
&s;erves for the guide of his life.</P>
<P>EVERY one, who has begun to make
any progre&s;s in the world, will be &s;en&s;ible,
that to conduct him&s;elf in human affairs
with wi&s;dom and propriety, is often a mat|ter
of no &s;mall difficulty, Amid&s;t that
variety of characters, of jarring di&s;po&s;i|tions,
and of interfering intere&s;ts, which
take place among tho&s;e with whom we
have intercour&s;e, we are frequently at a
&s;tand, as to the part mo&s;t prudent for us
to chu&s;e. Ignorant of what is pa&s;&s;ing
in the brea&s;ts of tho&s;e around us, we can
form no more than doubtful conjectures
concerning the events that are likely to
happen. They may take &s;ome turn alto|gether
different from the cour&s;e in which
we had imagined they were to run, and
according to which we had formed our
plans. The &s;lighte&s;t incident often &s;hoots
out into important con&s;equences of which
we were not aware. The labyrinth be|comes
<PB N="318" REF="327">
&s;o intricate, that the mo&s;t &s;agacious
can lay hold on no clue to guide him
through it; He finds him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed,
and at lo&s;s how to act.&mdash;In public and
in private life, in managing our own con|cerns,
and in directing tho&s;e of others,
the doubt &s;tarted by the Wi&s;e man fre|quently
occurs; <HI>Who knoweth what is
good for man in this life?</HI>&mdash;while thus fa|tigued
with conjecture, we remain per|plexed
and undetermined in our choice;
we are at the &s;ame time pulled to diffe|rent
&s;ides, by the various emotions which
belong to our nature./ On one hand, plea|&s;ure
allures us to what is agreeable; on
the other, intere&s;t weighs us down to|wards
what &s;eems gainful. Honour at|tracts
us towards what is &s;plendid; and
indolence inclines us to what is ea&s;y. In
the con&s;ultations which we hold with our
own mind concerning our conduct., how
often are we thus divided within our&s;elves;
puzzled by the uncertainty of future e|vents,
and di&s;tracted by the conte&s;t of
different inclinations?</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="328">
It is in &s;uch &s;ituations as the&s;e, that the
principle of integrity interpo&s;es to give
light and direction. While worldly men
fluctuate in the mid&s;t of tho&s;e perplexi|ties
which I have de&s;cribed, the virtuous
man has one Oracle, to which he re&s;orts in
every dubious ca&s;e, and who&s;e deci&s;ions
he holds to be infallible: He con&s;ults his
con&s;cience. He li&s;tens to the voice of
God. Were it only on a few occa&s;ions
that this Oracle could be con&s;ulted, its
value would be le&s;s. But it is a mi&s;take
to imagine, that its Re&s;pon&s;es are &s;eldom
given. Hardly is there any material tran&s;|action
whatever in human life, any im|portant
que&s;tion, that holds us in &s;u&s;pence
as to practice, but the difference between
right and wrong will &s;how it&s;elf; and the
principle of integrity will, fi we li&s;ten to
it impartially, give a clear deci&s;ion.
whenever the mind is divided within it|&s;elf,
con&s;cience is &s;eldom or never neutral.
There is always one &s;ide or other to which
it leans. There is always one &s;cale of the
balance, into which it throws the weight
<PB N="320" REF="329">
of <HI>&s;ome virtue; or &s;ome prai&s;e;</HI> of &s;ome|thing
that is <HI>ju&s;t and true, lovely, hone&s;t, and
of good report.</HI> The&s;e are the forms, which
ri&s;e to the ob&s;ervation of the upright
man. By others they may be un&s;een, nor
overlooked; but in his eye, the lu&s;tre of
virtue out&s;hines all other brightne&s;s.
Wherever this pole &s;tar directs him, he
&s;teadily holds his cour&s;e.&mdash;Let the i&s;|&s;ue
of that cour&s;e be ever &s;o uncertain;
let his friends differ from him in opi|nion;
let his enemies clamour; he is not
moved; his purpo&s;e is fixed. He a&s;ks
but one que&s;tion of his heart, what is the
mo&s;t worthy and honourable part; what
is the part mo&s;t becoming the &s;tation
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the character which
he wi&s;hes to bear, the expectations which
good men entertain of him? Being once
decided as to this, he he&s;itates no more.
He &s;huts his ears again&s;t every &s;olicita|tion.
He pur&s;ues the direct line of inte|grity,
without <HI>turning either to the right
hand or to the left.</HI> &startq;It is the Lord who
calleth. Him I follow. Let him or|der
<PB N="321" REF="330">
what &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight.&endq;
&mdash;It is in this manner that the <HI>integrity
of the upright acts as their guide</HI></P>
<P>But as, upon a &s;uperficial view, it may
appear hazardous to place our&s;elves en|tirely
under &s;uch a guide, let us now pro|ceed
to con&s;ider what can be &s;aid in de|fence
of this plan of conduct, and what
advantages &s;erve to recommend it.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, I affirm, that the guid|ance
of integrity is the &s;afe&s;t under which
we can be placed; that the road in which
it leads us is, upon the whole, the free&s;t
from dangers. Perfect immunity form
danger is not to be expected in this life.
We can chu&s;e no path, in which we may
not meet with di&s;appointments and mi&s;|fortunes.
Our life, at the be&s;t, is a pil|grimage,
and perils &s;urround it. Again&s;t
the&s;e perils, the men of the world imagine
that craft and dexterity furni&s;h the be&s;t
defence; and if, in any in&s;tance, they o|ver-reach
the upright, they con&s;ider it as
a manife&s;t deci&s;ion in favour of their
<PB N="322" REF="331">
plan. But in&s;tead of re&s;ting on a few
in&s;tances, let us take an exten&s;ive &s;urvey
of the cour&s;e of human affairs. Let us
enquire who the per&s;ons are that, in all
the different lines of life, have gone
through the world with mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;s;
and we &s;hall find, that the men of probity
and honour form by far the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
part of the li&s;t; we &s;hall find
that men of plain under&s;tanding, acting
upon fair $nd direct views, have much
oftener pro&s;pered, than men of the deep|e&s;t
policy, who were devoid of principle.
How few are the in&s;tances of per&s;ons who
by fidelity, worth, and &s;tedfa&s;t adherence
to their duty, have either lo&s;t their for|tunes,
or incurred general displea&s;ure, in
times when human affairs were proceed|ing
in their ordinary train? But how nu|merous
and frequent are the examples of
tho&s;e who&s;e pro&s;pects have been bla&s;ted,
who&s;e circum&s;tances have been ruined,
and their names &s;unk into contempt by
vice and di&s;hone&s;ty?</P>
<P>The man of the world aims at higher
<PB N="323" REF="332">
things, and more rapid &s;ucce&s;s, than the
man of moderation and virtue. But, at
the &s;ame time, he incurs greater ri&s;ques
and dangers. No calculation of proba|bilities
can en&s;ure &s;afety to him who is
acting a deceitful part. Amid&s;t the un|fore&s;een
vici&s;&s;itudes of the world, he has
to dread, not only di&s;appointment to his
plans, but the mi&s;eries al&s;o which detect|ed
fallacies may bring on his head. He
walks on the edge of precipices, where a
&s;ingle fal&s;e &s;tep may be fatal. He fol|lows
a wandering light, which, if it fail
of guiding him by a &s;hort path to the Pa|lace
of ambition, lands him in the pit, or
the lake. Whereas he who follows the
guidance of integrity, walks in the high
road on which the light of the &s;un &s;hines.
He &s;ees before him the Habitation of peace
to which his &s;teps are directed; and if he
be longer of arriving at it, he is &s;ure of
neither wandering far a&s;tray, nor of meet|ing
on his road with any forms of unu|&s;ual
terror.&mdash;Let it be always remem|bered
that the principle of integrity which
<PB N="324" REF="333">
directs a good man, is far from excluding
prudence in the conduct of life. It im|plies
no improvident or thoughtle&s;s &s;im|plicity.
On the contrary, it is clo&s;ely
connected with true wi&s;dom. A man of
enlarged capacity, and exten&s;ive views, is
always upright. Craft is merely the &s;up|plement
of inferior abilities. It charac|terizes
a narrow comprehen&s;ion, and a
little mind.&mdash;As the path of integrity is
on the whole the &s;afe&s;t path of con|duct;
&s;o,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, it is unque&s;tionably
the mo&s;t honourable. Integrity is the
foundation of all that is high in character
among mankind. Other qualities may add
to its &s;plendor; but if this e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite
be wanting, all their lu&s;tre fades. Were I
drawing the character of one who claimed
the admiration of the world; and after I
had a&s;cribed to him cloquence, valour,
and every endowment that is mo&s;t &s;hin|ing
and captivating, did I add, that he was
a man of too much art to be tru&s;ted, I ap|peal
<PB N="325" REF="334">
to every one, whether by this &s;ingle
&s;troke, the whole character would not be
&s;unk and degraded? An intere&s;ted and
crafty man may perhaps ri&s;e into in$lu|ence
and high &s;tation; he may be a rich
and a powerful, but will never be a great,
man. He may be feared, and externally
honoured and courted; but in the &s;ecret
thoughts of men he finds no re&s;pect.
We all feel, that magnanimous &s;entiments
cannot dwell in the &s;ame brea&s;t with &s;el|fi&s;hne&s;s
and deceit.</P>
<P>He who re&s;ts upon an internal principle
of virtue and honour, will act with a dig|nity
and a boldne&s;s, of which they are in|capable
who are wholly guided by intere&s;t.
He is above tho&s;e timid &s;u&s;picions, and
cautious re&s;traints, which &s;etter and em|barra&s;s
their conduct. That firmne&s;s
which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of rectitude in|&s;pires,
gives vigour and force to his exer|tions
on every great occa&s;ion. It adds dou|ble
weight to all the abilities of which he is
po&s;&s;e&s;t. It even &s;upplies the place of tho&s;e
abilities in which he is defective. They
<PB N="326" REF="335">
who oppo&s;e him are obliged to honour him.
They look up to him with a &s;ecret awe, as
to one who moves above them in a &s;uperior
&s;phere; regardle&s;s of their good or ill opi|nion,
of their promi&s;es or their threaten|ings;
like one of tho&s;e cele&s;tial luminaries
which holds its cour&s;e through its orbit,
without being affected by any commo|tions
among the elements below. Such a
man is tru&s;ted and relied upon, as well as
e&s;teemed, becau&s;e all know where to find
him, and upon what &s;y&s;tem he acts. He
attaches $word$ and followers to him&s;elf,
without courting them; and though his
progre&s;s towards fame &s;hould be &s;low,
and interrupted at fir&s;t by crooked arts,
it is neverthele&s;s certain and &s;ure. The
public may be mi&s;led for a while, in judg|ing
of real merit; but it is &s;eldom unju&s;t
at the la&s;t. As per&s;ons continue to come
forward to view, and to act their part in
trying circum&s;tances, their characters are
at length fully a&s;certained; and, almo&s;t
always, rated as they de&s;erve. How cor|rupt
&s;oever the world may be, they can|not
<PB N="327" REF="336">
with-hold approbation from him,
who&s;e conduct is marked by uniform
integrity and honour. Enemies he will
have; but the public favours him; the
multitude of men wi&s;h him &s;ucce&s;s; and
de&s;tine him, in their thoughts, to every &s;tep
of his pre&s;erment, before he arrives at it.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, the plan of conduct,
on which the man of integrity proceeds
is the mo&s;t comfortable; that is, attended
with the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction in a man's
own mind. Amid&s;t the various and per|plexing
events of life, it is of &s;ingular ad|vantage
to be kept free from doubt, as to
the part mo&s;t proper to be cho&s;en. He
who con&s;ults nothing but worldly inte|re&s;t
mu&s;t, upon every turn of fortune, un|dergo
much painful &s;u&s;pence. He is o|bliged
to li&s;ten with anxious ear to every
whi&s;per of report; and upon every new
a&s;pect which the face of affairs a&s;&s;umes,
mu&s;t &s;tudy how to place him&s;elf in a new
po&s;ture of defence. But the man of prin|ciple
is a &s;tranger to the&s;e inward trou|bles.
<PB N="328" REF="337">
His time is not lo&s;t; nor his tem|per
&s;retted by long and anxious con&s;ulta|tions.
One light always &s;hines upon him
from above. One path, the path of inte|grity,
always opens clear and di&s;tinct to
his view.&mdash;But this is not his only advan|tage,
to be freed from embara&s;&s;ments, by
having placed him&s;elf under the charge of
one con&s;tant guide. He is al&s;o rewarded
with the &s;en&s;e of having cho&s;en his guide
well and wi&s;ely. He is delivered from all
inward upbraidings, from all mi&s;givings
of mind, from all alarms founded on the
dread of di&s;covery and di&s;grace. A good
con&s;cience enables him to look back on
the part which he has acted with &s;atis|faction;
and to look forward to the i&s;&s;ue
which it may bring, without concern, It
is in the ca&s;e of one i&s;&s;ue only, that the
man who acts from worldly intere&s;t can
enjoy &s;atisfaction; that is, when his de|&s;igns
have &s;ucceeded according to his wi&s;h.
But it is the &s;elicity of the man, who acts
under the direction of integrity, that in
every i&s;&s;ue, he has &s;omething to comfort
<PB N="329" REF="338">
him. Though &s;ucce&s;s has <HI>failed</HI> him, the
con&s;olation remains of having done his
duty, and &s;tudied to approve him&s;elf to
God.</P>
<P>This reference of all his actions to di|vine
approbation furnishes another &s;ource
of &s;atis&s;action and peace. He looks up,
with plea&s;ing hope, to a Protector in the
heavens, who <HI>loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, and who&s;e
countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI> The man
of wordly wi&s;dom is con&s;cious of having
no title to the favour of that high admini|&s;tration
which rules the univer&s;e. By
quitting the path of righteou&s;ne&s;s, he has
left that &s;traight road, in which God had
appointed him to walk. He has taken the
direction of his way to him&s;elf; and cho|&s;en
to be his own guide and m&s;ter. To
his own abilities, therefore, &s;uch as they
are, he mu&s;t tru&s;t; and is become wholly
re&s;pon&s;ible for the i&s;&s;ue of his conduct.
But the man of virtue hath <HI>committed his
way to the Lord.</HI> He follows the divine
&s;ignal. He co-operates with the divine
prupo&s;e. The power which &s;ways the u|niver&s;e
<PB N="330" REF="339">
is engaged on his &s;ide. By natural
con&s;equence, he had ground to expect,
that any &s;eeming di&s;appointments which
he may now incur, &s;hall be over-ruled at
the end to &s;ome &s;alutary effect. Hence,
that <HI>peace of God keeping the heart,</HI> to which
worldly men are &s;trangers. Hence a de|gree
of firmne&s;s and re&s;olution in conduct,
which it is impo&s;&s;ible for them to po&s;&s;e&s;s.
E&s;pecially when we add.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;ourth</HI> and la&s;t place, that he who
thus pru&s;ues a cour&s;e of integrity, has al|ways
in his view the pro&s;pect of immor|tal
rewards. That &s;urely is the wi&s;e&s;t di|rection
of conduct, which is mo&s;t amply
recompen&s;ed at la&s;t. But what recom|pence
can worldly wi&s;dom be&s;tow, com|parable
to what is promi&s;ed by the go&s;|pel
to them who, <HI>by patient continuance in
well doing, look for glory, honour, and immor|tality?</HI>
&mdash;The recompence indeed is di&s;tant;
but the hope of it is pre&s;ent; and hope is
one of the mo&s;t powerful principles of hu|man
action. Let a man be firm in the
<PB N="331" REF="340">
belief that he is acting under the im|mediate
protection of Heaven, and that
through all eternity he &s;hall be rewarded
for what he now performs; and, as far
as this belief is prevalent, his conduct will
be &s;teady and determined. Wherever re|ligion
directs him to hold his cour&s;e, he
will advance with intrpidity. He will
&s;ubmit to re&s;traints without reluctance.
He will meet dangers without fear. To
every motive which rea&s;on &s;ugge&s;ts in fa|vour
of virtue, the hope of life eternal
adds &s;upernatural &s;trength.&mdash;Accordingly,
in the behaviour of many holy men, un|der
the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances of di&s;|tre&s;s,
we behold this effect eminently ex|emplified.
It appears, with much lu&s;tre,
in the &s;pirited and $word$ &s;enti|ments
of the Apo&s;tle Paul, when he had
the pro&s;pect of death before him. <HI>Behold
I go bound in the spirit to $word$ not
knowing the things that &s;hall be&s;al me there,
&s;ave that the Holy Gho&s;t $ that
bonds and $word$ abide me. But none of
the&s;e things move me; neither count $ my
<PB N="332" REF="341">
life dear unto my&s;elf, &s;o that I may fini&s;h my
cour&s;e with joy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">$cts xv. 22.</NOTE>.&mdash;I am now ready to
be offered, and the time of my departure is
at hand. I have &s;ought a good &s;ight; I
have fini&s;hed my cour&s;e; I have kept the
faith. Hence&s;orth there is laid up for me a
crown of $word$, which the Lord, the
righteous $word$, &s;hall give me at that day<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Timothy. iv. 6.</NOTE>.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have endeavoured to &s;how in
what manner the <HI>integrity of the upright
guides them;</HI> and what the advantages
are of placing our&s;elves under its guid|ance.
If it be the line of &s;afety, or the
line of honour, which we chu&s;e to pur|&s;ue;
if we con&s;ult our pre&s;ent comfort
or look forward to future rewards; in all
the&s;e re&s;pects, the cour&s;e which integrity
points out is by far the mo&s;t eligible.</P>
<P>It is a great recommendation of the guid|ance
offered to us by integrity, that it is
ea&s;ily under&s;tood by all men. Plans of
<PB N="333" REF="342">
worldly policy are deep and intricate;
and experience &s;hows how often the a|ble&s;t
per&s;ons are mi&s;taken in the mea&s;ures
which they adapt for carrying them on.
But when men's intentions are fair and
upright, it will be found, that a moderate
&s;hare of under&s;tanding and attention is
all that is requi&s;ite, for conducting them|&s;elves
with &s;afety and propriety. Providence
never intended, that the art of liv|ing
happily in this world &s;hould depend
on that deep penetration, that acute &s;aga|city,
and tho&s;e refinements of thoughts,
which few po&s;&s;e&s;s. It has dealt more
graciou&s;ly with us; and made happine&s;s
to depend on uprightne&s;s of intention,
much more than on extent of capacity.
For the mo&s;t part, the fir&s;t &s;entiment
which &s;trikes a good man, concerning
what he ought, or ought not to do, is the
&s;ounde&s;t, and &s;ugge&s;ts the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t
coun&s;el. when he he&s;itates, and begins
to deliberate how far his duty, or his ho|nour,
can be reconciled to what &s;eems his
intere&s;t, he is on the point of deviating
<PB N="334" REF="343">
into a dangerous path.&mdash;At the &s;ame
time, it is of great con&s;equence, that he
who &s;eeks to &s;urrender his conduct to the
direction of integrity, &s;hould be well ap|prized
of what true integrity requires.
Let him guard again&s;t burdening con&s;ci|ence
unnece&s;&s;arily; left a &s;uper&s;titious re|gard
to trifles lead him to relax in mat|ters
of higher obligation. Let him avoid
minute &s;crupulo&s;ity, on the one hand.
Let him keep at a di&s;tance from loo&s;e ca|&s;ui&s;try,
on the other. But when he is &s;a|tisfied
that his con&s;cience has been well
informed, let him, without wavering, ad|here
to its dictates in the whole of his
conduct. This will prove the true&s;t wi&s;|dom
both for this world and the next.
For <HI>he who walketh uprightly walketh &s;ure|ly.
The path of the ju&s;t is as the &s;hining
light:</HI> And it &s;hall <HI>&s;hine more and more unto
the perfect day.</HI></P>

under tho&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, religion performs
two offices: it teaches us how we ought
to bear them; and it a&s;&s;i&s;ts us in thus
bearing them. Materials for both are
found in the words of the text, which
contain a &s;entiment &s;o natural and ju&s;t,
as to carry conviction to every rea&s;onable
mind. They were the words of Job, at
a time when, to his other calamities, this
dome&s;tic affliction was added, That one,
who ought to have a&s;&s;uaged and &s;oothed

<HI>as one of the fooli&s;h women &s;peaketh:
what? &s;hall we receive good at the hand
of God, and hall we not receive evil?</HI>&mdash;
Three in&s;tructions naturally ari&s;e from the
text: Fir&s;t, that this life is a mixed &s;tate
of good and evil: Secondly, that both the goods and the evils in it proceed from
God: And, thirdly, That there are ju&s;t
rea&s;ons for our receiving with patience
the evils of life, from the &s;ame hand
which be&s;tows its goods.</P>
<P><PB N="337" REF="346">
I. This life is a mixed &s;tate of good
and evil. This is a matter of fact, which
will be denied by nene., and on which it
is not nece&s;&s;ary to be&s;tow much illu&s;tra|tion
It is evident to the &s;lighte&s;t in&s;pec|tion,
that nothing here is unallayed and
pure. Every man's &s;tate is checquered
with alternate griefs and joys, di&s;appoint|ment
and &s;ucce&s;s. No condition is alto|gether
&s;table. No life pre&s;erves always
the &s;ame tenor. The vici&s;&s;itudes of the
world &s;ometimes bring forward the af|flicted
into more comfortable circum&s;tan|ces;
and often trouble the joy of the pro|&s;perous.
This is the train in which hu|man
affairs have ever been found to pro|ceed;
and in which we may expect them
always to go on.</P>
<P>But though this be univer&s;ally admit|ted
in &s;peculation, and often confe&s;&s;ed in
di&s;cour&s;e, the misfortune is, that few think
of applying it to their own ca&s;e. The
bulk of mankind di&s;cover as much confi|dence
in pro&s;perity, and as much impa|tience
under the lea&s;t rever&s;e, as if Pro|vidence
<PB N="338" REF="347">
had fir&s;t given them a&s;&s;urance
that their pro&s;perity was never to change,
and afterwards had cheated their hopes.
Whereas, what rea&s;on ought to teach us,
is, to adju&s;t our mind to the mixed &s;tate
in which we find our&s;elves placed; never
to pre&s;ume, never to de&s;pair; to be thank|ful
for the goods which at pre&s;ent we en|joy,
and to expect the evils that may &s;uc|ceed.
&mdash;Thou ha&s;t been admitted to partake
of the fea&s;t of life,. Its good things are
di&s;tributed, in various portions, among the
gue&s;ts. thou ha&s;t had thine allotted
&s;hare. Complain not, when they portion
is removed. It is not permitted to any
one, to remain always at the banquet.</P>
<P>II. We are taught by the text, that both
the goods and the evils which compo&s;e
this mixed &s;tate, come from the hand of
God. A little reflection may convince
us, that, in God's world, neither good nor
evil can happen by chance. If there were
any one moment, in which God quitted
the reins of the univer&s;e, and &s;uffered any
<PB N="339" REF="348">
power to interfere with his admini&s;tra|tion,
it is evident, that, from that moment,
the mea&s;ures of his government mu&s;t be|come
disjointed and incomplete. He
who governs all things, mu&s;t govern con|tinually;
and govern the lea&s;t things as
well as the greate&s;t. <HI>He never &s;lumbers
nor &s;leeps.</HI> There are no void &s;paces, no
broken plans, in his admini&s;tration; no
ble&s;&s;ings that drop upon us without his
intention; nor any cro&s;&s;es that vi&s;it us,
un&s;ent by him. <HI>I am the Lord, and there
is none el&s;e. I form the light, and create
darkne&s;s. I make peace, and create evil. I
the Lord do all the&s;e things,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">$word$ xlv. 6, 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>How it has come to pa&s;s, that this life
&s;hould contain &s;uch a mixture of goods
and evils, and that the mixture too &s;hould
be of God's appointment, gives ri&s;e to a
difficult inquiry. for how can any thing
but what is good proceed from the God
of love? Can darkne&s;s i&s;&s;ue form the
<PB N="340" REF="349">
&s;ource of light? or can it be any &s;atis|faction
to the <HI>Father of mercies,</HI> to behold
the &s;orrows of creatures whom he has
made?&mdash;Here there was room for much
perplexity, till revelation informed us, that
the mixture of evils in man's e&s;tate is ow|ing
to man him&s;elf. Had he continued
as God originally made him, he would
have received nothing but good from his
Creator. His apo&s;ta&s;y and corruption o|pened
the gates of the tabernacle of dark|ne&s;s.
Mi&s;ery i&s;&s;ued forth, and has ever
&s;ince pur&s;ued him. In the pre&s;ent condi|tion
of his nature, that mi&s;ery is partly
puni&s;hment,
partly trial. He is become
incapable to bearing uninterrupted pro|&s;perity;
and by the mixture of evils in
his lot, merciful de&s;igns are carried on for
his improvement and re&s;toration.</P>
<P>What the text leads us at pre&s;ent to con|&s;ider
is, the effect that will follow from
imitating the example of Job, and refer|ring
to the hand of the Almighty, the evils
which we &s;uffer, as well as the goods which
we enjoy. Such a reference of the di|&s;tre&s;sful
<PB N="341" REF="350">
events of our life to the appoint|ment
of Heaven, not only is a duty which
piety requires, but tends also to mitigate
di&s;tre&s;s, and to &s;ugge&s;t con&s;olation. For
to dwell, as is too commonly done, upon
the in&s;truments and &s;ubordinate means of
our trouble, is frequently the cau&s;e of
much grief, and much &s;in. When we
view our &s;ufferings as proceeding merely
from our fellow-creatures, the part which
they have acted in bringing them upon
us, is often more grating than the &s;uffer|ing
it&s;elf. The unrea&s;onablene&s;s, perhaps,
of an enemy, the treachery of a friend,
the ingratitude or in&s;olence of one whom
we had much obliged, add weight to a
load laid upon us by means &s;o provoking
The thoughts of their malignity, or of our
own neglect in guarding again&s;t it, &s;erve
to poi&s;on the &s;ore. Whereas, if in&s;tead of
looking to men, we beheld the cro&s;s as
coming from God, the&s;e aggravating cir|cum&s;tances
would affect us le&s;s; we would
feel no more than our proper burden;
<PB N="342" REF="351">
we would &s;ubmit to it more patiently;
and many re&s;ources would open to us, as
&s;hall in a little be &s;houwn, from thinking
of the hand that lays it on. Had job,
when de&s;poiled of all his &s;ub&s;tance, thought
of nothing but the Chaldeans and Sabeans
who robbed him, with what violent pa&s;|&s;ions
would he have been tran&s;ported, and
with what eager di&s;ires of revenge tor|mented?
Whereas, con&s;idering them as
rods and in&s;truments only in the divine
hand, and receiving the correction as from
the Almighty him&s;elf, the tumult of his
mind &s;ub&s;ided; and with re&s;pectful com|po&s;ure
he could &s;ay, <HI>The Lord gave; and
the Lord hath taken away: Ble&s;&s;ed be the
name of the Lord.</HI> This leads me.</P>
<P>III. To con&s;ider the la&s;t, and mo&s;t im|portent
in&s;tructions, ari&s;ing from the text;
namely, that there are many rea&s;ons why
we, who receive good from the hand of
God, &s;hould receive with patience the
Evils which he is plea&s;ed to inflict. This
Is &s;trongly conveyed by that interoga|tory
<PB N="343" REF="352">
from of &s;peech, in which the &s;enti|ment
of job is expre&s;&s;ed: <HI>What we
receive good at the hand of God, and &s;hall
we not receive evil?</HI> In order to unfold all
that is contained in this appeal made to eve|ry
man's con&s;cience, let us con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, that the good things
which God has be&s;towed, afford &s;ufficient
evidence for our believing, that the evils
which he &s;ends, are not can &s;ele&s;sly or wan|tonly
inflicted. Did we live in a world
which bore the marks of a malicious or
cruel governor, there might be rea&s;on for
di&s;tru&s;ting every &s;tep of his conduct. But
in the world which we inhabit, we behold,
on the contrary, plain marks of predomi|nant
goodne&s;s. we behold the &s;tructure of
the univer&s;e, the order of nature, the gene|ral
cour&s;e of Providence, obviou&s;ly arranged
with a benevolent regard to the welfare of
men. All the art and contrivance of which
the divine works are full, point to this
end; and the more they are explored,
create the firmer belief, that the good|ne&s;s
<PB N="344" REF="353">
of the Deity gave ri&s;e to the &s;y&s;|tem
of creation. What is the conclu|&s;ion
to be thence drawn, but that in &s;uch
parts of the divine admini&s;tration as ap|pear
to us har&s;h and &s;evere, the &s;ame good|ne&s;s
continues to pre&s;ide, though exerci|&s;ed
in a hidden and my&s;terious manner?</P>
<P>Let me de$ire you to con&s;ider, whether
if &s;omepowerful friend had placed you
in an opulent and comfortable &s;tation,
and, in the general conduct of your a$$airs,
had di&s;covered the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted kind|ne&s;s,
you would not a&s;cribe any occa&s;ional
di&s;couragements you received, to &s;ome un|known
rea&s;on or cau&s;e rather than to his
unfaithfulne&s;s or cruelty? Ought not the
experience which we have had, and the
di&s;covery which all nature affords, of the
divine goodne&s;s, lead us to put a like con|&s;truction
on the evils which we &s;uffer
from a hand that hath &s;o frequently load|ed
us with good?&mdash;Have we forgotten,
in the mid&s;t of our complaints, who
brought us unto the light of day; who
watched over our helple&s;s infancy; who
<PB N="345" REF="354">
reared our growing childhood; and
though ten thou&s;and &s;urrounding dan|gers,
has been our protector and guardian
until this day? How often has he re&s;cu|ed
us from &s;ickne&s;s and death, and made
our hearts glad with unexpected com|forts?
Now, that &s;ome cloud is thrown o|ver
our pro&s;perity, or &s;ome ble&s;&s;ing with|drawn,
in which for a time we had rejoi|ced,
can we imagine that there is no good
cau&s;e for this change of his proceeding?
Shall we &s;u&s;pect that his nature is entire|ly
altered? <HI>Hath God forgotten to be gra|cio$s?
Hath he in anger &s;hut up his te$der
mercies?</HI> No, let us &s;ay with the p&s;almi&s;t,
<HI>This is my infirmity; but I will remember
the works of the Lord. I will remember the
years of the right hand of the mo&s;t High</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">P&s;. lxxvii ix. 10&#62;</NOTE>
&mdash;One &s;ignal works of the mo&s;t High
at lea&s;t, let us remember, and rejoice in
the remembrance of it; even that final
remedy which he has provided for all the
<PB N="346" REF="355">
evils occa&s;ioned by &s;in, in the redemption
of the world accomli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
<HI>He who &s;pared not his own Son, but deliver|ed
him up for us all,</HI> will he, in any ca&s;e,
wantonly a&s;&s;ict the children of men with
&s;uper&s;luous and unnece&s;&s;ary, &s;orrows? Is
not this a proof &s;o &s;atisfactory, &s;o expre&s;s
and demon&s;tratives, of the gracious pur|po&s;es
of God, as &s;hould di&s;po&s;e us to take
in good part, every thing which proceeds
from him? Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, that the good things
we receive from God are unde&s;erved, the
evils we &s;uffer are ju&s;tly merited. Every
rea&s;onable per&s;on mu&s;t feel the weight of
this con&s;ideration, for producing patience
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. For, thought to &s;uffer at
any rate be grievus, yet to &s;uffer unju&s;t|ly,
is double galling. Whereas, when
one receives a mixed portion, where of the
goods are above his de&s;erts, and the evils
below his de&s;erts, to complain, in &s;uch a
ca&s;e, is unrea&s;onable; there is more
ground for being thankful.&mdash;all its, is
<PB N="347" REF="356">
true, have not de&s;erved evil equally. Yet
all of us de&s;erve it more or le&s;s; and to
merit good at the hand of the Lord, is
what none of us can pretend. At the be&s;t
we are but <HI>unprofitable &s;ervants.</HI> Even this is
more than we are entitled to claim. For
if God were to <HI>enter into judgement</HI> with
us, who could &s;tand before him? Who
could ju&s;tify him&s;elf in his &s;ight? When
the mo&s;t inoffen&s;ive compare their con|duct
with God's holy law; when they re|flect
upon the duties they have omitted,
and the actual guilt they have contracted,
they will find more rea&s;on to accu&s;e them|&s;elves,
than to complain of the divine
cha&s;ti&s;ment. Whatever innocence any
of us may plead, nay, whatever merit we
may claim, with re&s;pect to men and the
would, we &s;uffer no more than what we
de&s;erve from the Governor of the world,
and of his di&s;plea&s;ure, we know that the
wrath of man is no other than the in&s;tru|ment.</P>
<P>Not only all of us have done evil, but
what ought to be particularly attended
<PB N="348" REF="357">
to, God has ju&s;t title to puni$h us for it
Although a man know that he de&s;erves
puni&s;hment, yet he will not allow every
one to inflict it. A child will &s;ubmit to his
parents, a &s;ervant to his ma&s;ter, a &s;ubject to
the magi&s;trate, when he would not bear
correction from another hand. But no pa|rent
can have &s;o complete a right autho|rity
over his children, no ma&s;ter over his
&s;ervants, no magi&s;trate over his &s;ubjects, as
the Almighty hath over us. When we
were born, we brought nothing with us
into God's world. During our conti|nuance
in it, we have lived on the good
things which God was plea&s;ed to lend
us; and of which, God and our own con|&s;cience
know that we have made but a
&s;orry improvement. When he thinks
proper to take any of them away, no
wrong is done us; for they were not
ours. To have enjoyed them always, was
a favour. To enjoyed them &s;o long, was
what we neither de&s;erved, nor had any
title to expect.</P>
<P><PB N="349" REF="358">
In the <HI>third</HI> place, the good things
which at difference time we have received
and enjoyed, are much greater than the
evils which we &s;uffer. Of this fact. I am
&s;en&s;ible is will be difficult to per&s;uade the
afflicted. But would they weigh in a fair
balance, the whole of their circum&s;tances,
$hey would find it true. Whateve$ per|&s;ons
feel at the pre&s;ent, makes &s;o &s;trongs
an impre&s;&s;ion upon them, as very com|monly
to obliterat$ the memory of all the
pa&s;t. when one is oppre&s;&s;ed with &s;ome
painful de&s;ea&s;e in his body, or wru$g with
&s;ome &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s of mind every former
comfort, at that moments, g$$s for nothing
life is behold in all its gloom. A dark
cloud &s;eems to hang over it; and it is re|viled,
as no other than a &s;cene of wretch|edne&s;s
and &s;orrow. But this is to be un|ju&s;t
to human life, as well as ungratefu$
to its author.&mdash;Let me only de&s;ire you
to think how many days, how many
months, how many years, you have pa&s;&s;ed
in health, and ea&s;e, and comfort; how
many plea&s;urable feelings you have had;
<PB N="350" REF="359">
how many friends you have enjoyed;
how many ble&s;&s;ings, in &s;hort, of differ|rent
kinds you have $a&s;ted; and you will
be forced to acknowledge, that more ma|terials
of thank&s;iving pre&s;ent them&s;elves
than of la$entation and complaint.&mdash;
The&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, you will &s;ay, are pa&s;t.
But though pa&s;t, ought they to be gone
from your remembrance? Do they merit
no place, in the comparative e&s;timate of
the goods and evils of your &s;tate? Did
you could you, expect, that in this muta|ble
world, any temporal joy was to la&s;t
for ever? Has gratitude no influence to
form your minds to a calm acquie&s;cence
in your Benefactor's appointments? What
can be more rea&s;onable than to &s;ay, &startq;Hav|ing
in former times received &s;o many
good things from the hand of God,
&s;hall I not now, without murmuring,
receive the few evils which it plea&s;es
him to &s;end?&endq;</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> place, not only the goods
of life are upon the whole greater than
<PB N="351" REF="360">
its evils; but the evils which we &s;uffer
are &s;eldom, or never, without &s;ome mix|ture
of good. As there is no condition
on earth of pure unmixed selicity, &s;o there
is none &s;o mi&s;erable, as to be de&s;titute of
every comfort. Entire and complete mi|&s;ery,
if ever it take place, is of our own
procuring, not of God's &s;ending. None
but the mo&s;t gro&s;s and atrocious &s;inners
can be in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to di&s;cover
no ray of relief of hope. In the ordina|ry
di&s;tre&s;&s;es of life, it if generally our
own folly and infirmity which, upon the
lo&s;s of &s;ome one ble&s;&s;ing that we had
highly prized, deprives us of &s;atisfaction
in all other things. Many of our cala|mities
are purely imaginary, and &s;elf-cre|ated;
ari&s;ing $rom rival&s;hip or competi|tion
with others, and from fal&s;e opinions
of the importance of objects, to which
cu&s;tom and fa&s;hion have annexed an ideal
value. Were the&s;e mi&s;taken opinions
once corrected by rea&s;on, the evil would
di&s;appear, and contentment would re&s;ume
its place. With re&s;pect to tho&s;e calami|ties
<PB N="352" REF="361">
which are inflicted by God, his pro|vidence
has made this wi&s;e and merciful
con&s;titution, that, after the fir&s;t &s;hock, the
burden by degrees is lightened. Time
brings a gentle and powerful opiate to all
misfortunes. What is very violent can|not
la&s;t long; and what la&s;ts long we be|come
$ccu&s;tomed to bear. Every &s;ituation
that is permanent, at length is felt to be
tolerable. The mind accommodates it|&s;elf
to it; and by degrees regains its u|&s;ual
tranquility. Hence the greate&s;t part
of the evils of life are more terrible in the
previo$s apprehen&s;ion, than in the actual
feeling; and it &s;eldom happens but, in
one corner of other, &s;omething is found
on which the mind can lay hold for its
relief.</P>
<P>How many, for in&s;tance, do we behold
around us, &s;traitened in their worldly
circum&s;tances, and yet finding the means
to live cheerfully, with poverty and peace
in the &s;ame habitation? If we are deprive|ed
of friends whom we tenderly loved,
are there not &s;till &s;ome remaining, from
<PB N="353" REF="362">
whom we may expect much confort? If
our bodies are afflicted with &s;ore di&s;ea&s;e,
have we not rea&s;on to be thankful that
our mind continues vigorous and entire;
that we are in &s;ituation to look around
us for whatever can afford us ea&s;e; and
that after the decay of this frail and moul|dering
tabernacle, we can look forward to
a <HI>house not made with han$s eternal in the
heavens?</HI>&mdash;In the mid&s;t of all di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
there remains to every &s;incere Chri&s;tian,
that mixture of pure and genuine con&s;o|lation,
which &s;prings from the promi&s;es
and hopes of the go&s;pel. Con&s;ider, I be|&s;eech
you, what a &s;ingularly happy di&s;|tinction
this makes in your &s;ituation, be|yond
the &s;tate of tho&s;e who, under the va|rious
troubles of life, are left <HI>without hoe,
and without God in the world;</HI> without
any thing to look to, but a train of un|known
cau&s;e and accidents, in which
they &s;ee no light nor comfort.&mdash;Thank
the Father of mercies, that into all the e|vils
he &s;ends, he infu&s;es this joyful hope,
that the <HI>&s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent time are
<PB N="354" REF="363">
not worthy to be compared with the glory
that &s;hall be $e$ealed</HI> in the end, to the
virtuous and good.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fifth</HI> and la&s;t place, as the evils
which we &s;uffer are thus alleviated by a
mixture of good; &s;o we have rea&s;on to be|lieve,
that the evils them&s;elves are, in ma|ny
re&s;pects, good. When borne with pa|tience
and dignity, they improve and e|noble
our character. They bring into
exerci&s;e &s;everal of the manly and heroic
virtues; and by the con&s;tancy and fide|lity
with which we &s;upport our trials on
earth, prepare us for the hight&s;t rwards
in heaven.&mdash;It has always been found
that the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of human na|ture
cannot bear uninterrupted pro&s;peri|ty,
without being corrupted by it. The
poi&s;onous weeds which &s;pring up in that
too luxuriant &s;oil, require the hand of ad|ver&s;ity
to extirpate them. It is the expe|rience
of &s;orrow and di&s;tre&s;s that &s;ubdues

of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;often&s;s the hardness of the &s;el|fi&s;h

The duties which &s;pring from that charac|ter,
form many branches of the great law
of charity, which is the favourite precept
of Chri&s;tianity. They, therefore, who
would &s;eparate &s;uch duties from a religious
&s;pirit, or who at mo&s;t treat them as only
<PB N="359" REF="368">
the inferior parts of it do a real injury to
religion. They are mi&s;taken friends of
piety, who, under the notion of exalting
it, place it in a &s;ort of in&s;ulated cor|ner,
disjoined from the ordinary affairs
of the world, and the connections of
men with one another. On the contra|ry,
true piety influences them all. It
acts as a vivifying &s;pirit, which animates
and enlivens, which rectifies and conducts
them. It is no le&s;s friendly to men than
zealous for the honour of God; and by
the generous affections which it nouri&s;h|es,
and the beneficent influence which it
exerts on the whole of conduct, is fully
vindicated from every reproach which
the infidel would throw upon it.&mdash;In this
view, I am now to di&s;cour&s;e on the na|ture
and duties of virtuous friend&s;hip, as
clo&s;ely connected with the true &s;pirit of
religion. It is a &s;ubject which the in&s;pi|red
philo&s;opher, who is the author of this

his repeated notice; and in many pa&s;&s;ages

Thine o$n friend, and thy father's friend,</HI> it is &s;aid in the text, <HI>for&s;ake not.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST begin the &s;ubject, by ob&s;erving,
that there are among mankind friend|&s;hip
of different kinds, or, at lea&s;t, con|nexions
which a&s;&s;ume that name. when
they are no more than confederacies of
bad men, they ought to be called con&s;pi|racies,
rather than friend&s;hips. Some bond
of common intere&s;t, &s;ome league again&s;t
the innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting, may have
united them for a time. But they are
held together only by a rope of &s;and.
At bottom they are all rivals, and ho&s;tile
to one another. Their friend&s;hip can
<PB N="361" REF="370">
&s;ub&s;i&s;t no longer than intere&s;t cements
them. Every one looks with a jealous
eye on his &s;uppo&s;ed friend; and watches
the fir&s;t favourable opportunity to de&s;ert,
or to betray.</P>
<P>Friend&s;hips too there are of a diffe|rent
kind, and of a more re&s;pectable na|ture,
formed by the connection of politi|cal
parties. It is not, perhaps, on &s;elfi&s;h
or crooked de&s;ign that &s;uch friend&s;hips
are originally founded. Men have been
a&s;&s;iciated together by &s;ome public intere&s;t,
or general cau&s;e, or for defence agin&s;t
&s;ome real or imagined danger; and con|nexions
thus formed, often draw men into
clo&s;e union, and in&s;ire for a &s;ea&s;on no
&s;mall degree of cordial attachment. When
upon ju&s;t and honourable principles this
union is founded, it has proved, on va|rious
occa&s;ions, favourable to the cau&s;e of
liberty and good order among mankind.
At the &s;ame time, nothing is more ready
to be abu&s;ed than the name of public &s;pi|rit,
and a public cau&s;e. It is a name, un|der
which private intere&s;t is often &s;helter|ed
<PB N="362" REF="371">
and &s;elfi&s;h de&s;ign are carried on.
The unwary are allured by a &s;pecious ap|pearance;
and the heat of faction u&s;urps
the place of the generous warmth of
freind&s;hip.</P>
<P>IT is not of &s;uch friend&s;hip, whether
of the laudable or the &s;u&s;picious kind,
that I am now to di&s;cour&s;e; but of pri|vate
friend&s;hip, which grow neither out
of intere&s;ted de&s;ign, nor party zeal; but
which &s;low from that &s;imilarity of di&s;po|&s;tions,
that corre&s;ponding harmony of
minds, which enders &s;ome per&s;on to our
heart, and makes us take as much part in
his circum&s;tances, fortunes, and fate, as if
they were our own. <HI>The &s;oul of Jonathan
was knit with the &s;oul of David; and Jo|nathan
loved him as his own &s;oul</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel xviii. 1.</NOTE>. Such
friend&s;hip certainly are not unreal; and
for the honour of human nature, it is to
be hoped are not altogether unfrequent
<PB N="363" REF="372">
among mankind.&mdash;Happy it is, when
they take root in our early years; and
are engrafted on the ingenuous &s;en&s;ibility
of youth. Friend&s;hip then contracted, re|tain
to the la&s;t a tenderne&s;s and warmth,
&s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by friend&s;hip that are
formed in the riper periods of life. The
remembrance of antient and youthful con|nections
melts every human heart; and
the di&s;&s;olution of them is, perhaps, the
mo&s;t painful feeling to which we are ex|po&s;ed
here below.&mdash;But at whatever pe|riod
of life friend&s;hip are formed, as long
as they continue &s;incere and affectionate
they form undoubtedly, one of the great|e&s;t
bel&s;&s;ing we can enjoy. By the plea&s;|ing
communication of all our &s;entiments
which they prompt, they are ju&s;tly &s;aid
to double our plea&s;ure, and to divide our
&s;orrows. They give brighter &s;un&s;hine
to the gay incidents of life; and they en|lighten
the gloom of its darker hours. <HI>A
faithful friend,</HI> it is ju&s;tly and beautifully
&s;aid, by one of the Apocryphal writers,
<PB N="364" REF="373">
<HI>is the medicine of life</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;ticus vi. 16.</NOTE>. A variety of oc|ca&s;ion
happen, when to pour forth the
heart to one whom we love and tru&s;t, is
the chief comfort, perhaps the only relief,
we can enjoy. Mi&s;erable is he who, &s;hut
up within the narrow inclo&s;ure of &s;elfi&s;h
intere&s;t, has no per&s;on to whom he can
at all times, with full confidence, expand
his &s;oul.</P>
<P>SINCE cordial friend&s;hip is &s;o great a
ble&s;&s;ing to human life, let us proceed to
con&s;ider what duties it requires, and by
what methods it may be cultivated to
mo&s;t advantage. The fundamental qua|lities
of true friend&s;hip are, con&s;tancy and
&s;idelity. Without the&s;e material ingre|dients,
it is of no value. An incon&s;tant
man is not capable of friend&s;hip. He
may perhaps have affections which occa|&s;ionally
glow in his heart; which excite
fondne&s;s for amiable qualities; or connect
<PB N="365" REF="374">
him with &s;eeming attachment to one
whom he e&s;teems, or to whom he has
been obliged. But after the&s;e feelings
have la&s;ted for a little, either fancied in|ter&s;t
alienates him, or &s;ome new object
attracts him; and he is no longer the
&s;ame per&s;on to tho&s;e whom he once loved.
A man of this incon&s;tant mind cannot be
&s;aid to have any mind at all. For where
there is no fixedne&s;s of moral principle,
occa&s;ional feelings are of no value; mind
is of no effect; and with &s;uch per&s;on it
is never de&s;irable to have any connexion.
Where con&s;tancy is wanting, there can be
no fidelity, which is the other ba&s;is of
friend&s;hip. For all friend&s;hip &s;uppo&s;es
entire confidence and tru&s;t; &s;uppo&s;es the
&s;eal of &s;ecrecy to be inviolable; &s;uppo&s;es
promi&s;es and engagements to be &s;acred;
and no advantage of our own to be pur|&s;ud,
at the expence of our friend's honour.
An incon&s;tant man, is de&s;picable. A faith|le&s;s
man, is ba&s;e.</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;ing neither con&s;tancy nor fi|delity
to be altogether wanting, &s;till how|ever
<PB N="366" REF="375">
friend&s;hip is in hazard of &s;uffering
from the follies, and unrea&s;onable hu|mours,
to which all of us are liable. It
it to be regarded as a tender plant in an
unfavourable &s;oil, which, in order to its
flouri&s;hing, requires to be reared and
nur&s;ed with care. The following direc|tions
may be of u&s;e for promoting its cul|tivation,
and pre&s;erving it from whatever
might be apt to bla&s;t and wither it.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let me advi&s;e you not
to expect perfection in any with whom
you contract friend&s;hip. It holds in ge|neral,
with re&s;pect to all worldly pur&s;uits,
that the more moderate our expectations
are, they are likely to be the more &s;ucce&s;s|ful.
If, in any &s;ituatin of life, we hope
to po&s;&s;es complete happine&s;s, we may de|pend
on receiving mortifications. If, in
any per&s;on, we tru&s;t to find nothing but
perfection we may be a&s;&s;ured that, on
longer acquaintance, we &s;hall meet with
di&s;appointments. In the ca&s;e of friend|&s;hip,
this admonition is the more nece&s;&s;a|ry
<PB N="367" REF="376">
to be given, as a certain warmth and
enthu&s;ia&s;m belong to it, which are apt to
carry us beyond the bounds of nature.
In young minds, e&s;pecially, a di&s;po&s;ition
of this kind is often found to take place.
They form to them&s;elves romantic ideas,
gathered perhaps from fictitious hi&s;tories,
of the high and heroic qualities which be|long
to human nature. All tho&s;e qua|lities,
they a&s;cribe, without re&s;erve or li|mitation
to the per&s;on with whom they
wi&s;h to enter into intimate friend&s;hip;
and on the lea&s;t failure appearing, aliena|tion
in&s;tantly follows. Hence many a
friend&s;hip, ha&s;tily perhaps contracted, is
as ha&s;tily di&s;&s;olved, and di&s;gu&s;t &s;ucceeds
to violent attachment.&mdash;Remember, my
friends, they a faultle&s;s character on earth
is a mere chimera. Many failings you
experience in your&s;elves. Be not &s;urpri|&s;ed,
when you di&s;cover the like in others,
of whom you had formed the highe&s;t o|pinion.
The be&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;timable
per&s;ons are they, in whom the fewe&s;t ma|terial
defects are found; and who&s;e great
<PB N="368" REF="377">
and &s;olid qualities counterbalance the
common infirmities of men. It is to
the&s;e qualities you are to look in forming
friend&s;hip; to good &s;en&s;e and prudence,
which con&s;titute the ba&s;is of every re&s;pec|table
character; to virtue, to good tem|per
to &s;teadine&s;s of affection; and accord|ing
to the union of tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions,
e&s;teem your&s;elves happy in the friend
whom you chu&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, I mu&s;t admoni&s;h
you not to be hurt by differences of opi|nion
afi&s;ing in intercour&s;e with your
friends. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the&s;e not to
occur. Perhaps no two per&s;ons were e|ver
ca&s;t &s;o exactly in the &s;ame mould, as
to think always in the &s;ame manner, on
every &s;ubject. It was wi&s;ely contrived by
Providence, that diver&s;ity of &s;entiment
&s;hould take place among men, on purpo&s;e
to exerci&s;e our faculties, and to give varie|ty
to human life. Perpetual uniformity
of thought would become monotonous
and in&s;ipid.&mdash;When it is with regard to
<PB N="369" REF="378">
trifles that diver&s;ity or contrariety of opi|nions
&s;hows it&s;elf, it is childi&s;h in the la&s;t
degree, it this become the ground of e|&s;tranged
affection. When from &s;uch a
cau&s;e there ari&s;es any breach of friend|&s;hip,
human weakne&s;s is then di&s;covered
in a mortifying light. In matters of &s;e|rious
moment, the &s;entiments of the be&s;t
and worthie&s;t may vary from tho&s;e of
their friends, according as their lines of
life diverge, or as their temper, and habits
of thought, pre&s;ent objects under different
points of view. But among candid and
liberal minds, unity of affection will &s;till
be pre&s;erved. No man has any title to
erect his own opinions into an univer&s;al
and infallible &s;tandard: And the more en|larged
that any man's mind is, the more
readily he will overlook difference in &s;en|timents,
as long as he is per&s;uaded that
he follows the dictates of con&s;cience and
integrity.</P>
<P><PB N="370" REF="379">
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, it is material to the
pre&s;ervation of friend&s;hip, that openne&s;s
of temper and manners, on both hands
be cultivated. Nothing more certainly
di&s;&s;olves friend&s;hip, than the jealou&s;y
which ari&s;es from darkne&s;s and conceal|ment.
If your &s;ituation oblige you to
take a different &s;ide from your friend, do
it openly. Avow your conduct; avow
your motives; as far as honour allows,
di&s;clo&s;e your&s;elves frankly; &s;eek no cover
from unnece&s;&s;ary and my&s;terious &s;ecrecy.
Mutual confidence is the &s;oul of friend|&s;hip.
As &s;oon as that is de&s;troyed, or
Even impaired, it is only a &s;how of friend|&s;hip
that remains. What was once cor|dial
intimacy, degenerates fir&s;t into formal
civility. Con&s;traint on both &s;ides next
&s;ucceeds; and di&s;gu&s;t or hatred &s;oon fol|low.
&mdash;The maxim that has been laid
down by certain crooked politicians, to
behave to a friend with the &s;ame guarded
caution as we would do to an enemy, be|cau&s;e
it is po&s;&s;ible that he may one day
become &s;uch, di&s;covers a mind which never
<PB N="371" REF="380">
was made for the enjoyments of friend&s;hip.
It is a maxim which, not unrea&s;onlably I
admit, may find place in tho&s;e political
and party friend&s;hips, of which I before
&s;poke, where per&s;onal advancement is al|ways
in view. But it is altogether incon|&s;i&s;tent
with the &s;pirit of tho&s;e friend&s;hip,
which are formed, and under&s;tood go be
nouri&s;hed, by the heart.</P>
<P>THE <HI>fourth</HI> advice which I give is, To
cultivate, in all intercour&s;e among friends,
gentle and obliging manners. It is a com|mon
error to &s;uppo&s;e, that familiar intima|cy
&s;uper&s;edes attention to the le&s;&s;er duties
of behaviour; and that, under the notion
of freedom, it may excu&s;e a carele&s;s, or
even a rough, demeanour. On the con|trary,
an intimate connection can only be
kept up, by a con&s;tant wi&s;h to be plea&s;ing
and agreeable. The nearer and clo&s;er that
men are brought together, the more fre|quent
that the points of contact between
them become, there is the greater nece&s;&s;ity
for the &s;urface being &s;mooth, and every
<PB N="372" REF="381">
thing being removed that can grate or of|fend.
&mdash;Let no har&s;hne&s;s no appearance of
neglect, no &s;upercilious affectation, of &s;u|priority,
occur in the intercour&s;e of
friends. A part reply, a pronene&s;s to re|buke,
a captious and contradictious &s;pirit,
are often known to embitter dome&s;tic life,
and &s;et friends at variance. In tho&s;e
&s;maller articles of behaviour, where men are
too apt to be carele&s;s, and to indulge their
humour without re&s;traint, the real cha|racter
is often under&s;tood to break forth,
and &s;hew it&s;elf. It is by no means e|nough,
that, in all matters of &s;erious in|tere&s;t,
we think our&s;elves ready to prove
the &s;incerity of our $$$$$$hip. The&s;e
occur more rarely. The o$d$$ary tenor
of life is compo&s;ed of &s;mall duties and $f|fices,
which men have occa&s;ion daily to
perform; and it is only by rendering dai|ly
behaviour agreeable, that we can long
pre&s;erve the comforts of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fifth</HI> place, let me caution you
not to li&s;ten ra&s;hly to evil reports again&s;t
<PB N="373" REF="382">
your friends. When upon proper grounds
you have formed a connection, be flow of
believing any thing again&s;t the friend whom
you have cho&s;en. Remember, that there
is among mankind a &s;pirit of malignity,
which too often takes plea&s;ure in di&s;turb|ing
the &s;ociety of tho&s;e who appear to en|joy
one another. The &s;cripture hath warn|ed
us, that there is a <HI>whi&s;perer who &s;epa|rateth
chief friends; there is a fal&s;e witne&s;s
who &s;o$$eth di&s;cord among brethren.</HI> Give
not therefore a ready ear to the officious
in&s;inuations of tho&s;e who, under the gui&s;e
of friendly concern, come to admoni&s;h
you, that you ought to &s;tand on your guard
again&s;t tho&s;e whom they &s;ee you di&s;po&s;ed
to tru&s;t. con&s;ider, whether, under this fair
appearance, there may not lurk &s;ome &s;e|cret
envy and rivalry, or &s;ome, concea$ed
intere&s;t. cha&s;e not every flying report.
Suffer not the poi&s;on of jealou&s;y ea&s;ily to
taint your mind, and break your peace.
A wide difference there is between that
weak credulity which allows it&s;elf to be
impo&s;ed upon blindly, and that dark and
<PB N="374" REF="383">
&s;u&s;picious &s;pirit which is always inclined
to the evil &s;ide. It forms part of the cha|rcter
of a wi&s;e and good man, that he is
not prone to <HI>to take up reproach again&s;t his
neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;ixth</HI> and la&s;t place, let me exhort
you not to de&s;ert your friend in danger
of di&s;tre&s;s. Too many there are in the
world, who&s;e attachment to tho&s;e they
call their friends is confined to the day of
their pro&s;perity. As long as that conti|nues,
they are, or appear to be, affection|ate
and cordial. But as &s;oon as their
friends is under a cloud, they begin to
withdraws, and to &s;eparate their intere&s;ts
from his. In friend&s;hip of this &s;ort, the
heart, a&s;&s;uredly, has never had much con|cern.
For the great te&s;t of true friend&s;hip,
is con&s;tancy in the hour of danger, adhe|rence
in the &s;ea&s;on of di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;When
your friend is calumniated, then is the
time, openly and boldly to e&s;pou&s;e his
cau&s;e. When his &s;ituation is changed, or
his fortunes are falling, then is the time of
<PB N="375" REF="384">
affording prompt and zealous aid. When
&s;ickne&s;s of infirmity occa&s;ion him to be
neglected by others, that is the opportu|nity
which every real friend will &s;eize, of
redoubling all the affectionate attentions
which love &s;ugge&s;ts. The&s;e are the im|portant
duties, the &s;acred claims of friend|&s;hip
which religion and virtue enforce on
every worthy mind.&mdash;To &s;how your&s;elves
warm, after this manner, in the cau&s;e of
your friend, commands e&s;teem, even from
tho&s;e who have per&s;onal intere&s;t in oppo&s;|ing
him. This honourable zeal of friend|&s;hip,
has, in every age, attracted the vene|ration
of mankind. It has con&s;ecrated
to the late&s;t po&s;terity the names of tho&s;e
who have given up their fortunes, and
have even expo&s;ed their lives, in behalf
of the friends whom they loved; while
ignominy and di&s;grace have ever been the
portion of them, who de&s;erted their friends
in the evil day. <HI>Thine own friend for&s;ake not.</HI></P>
<P>BEFORE concluding, it mu&s;t not be
forgotten that the injunction of the Wi&s;e
<PB N="376" REF="385">
Man in the text, is accompanied with this
remarkable expre&s;&s;ion; not only <HI>thine
own friend,</HI> but al&s;o <HI>thy father's friend
for&s;ake not.</HI> The&s;e words bring back to our
remembrance the days of former years;
and &s;ugge&s;t f &s;entiment, which cannot but
touch every feeling heart. Thine own
friend may be dear; thy father's friend
ought to be &s;acred. As long as life re|mains
in any human brea&s;t, the memory
of tho&s;e antient ties &s;hould remain, which
connected us once with our father, and
our father's hou&s;e.&mdash;Thy father has per|haps,
long ago, gone down to the du&s;t.
But when you recal the innocent days of
childhood and youth; when you think of
tho&s;e family tran&s;actions which once glad|dened
your hearts; your father's friend, in
the mid&s;t of the&s;e, will ri&s;e to your re|membrance.
There was a time when you
acco&s;ted him with re&s;pect, or looked up to
him with fondne&s;s, and was made happy
by his kindly notice. Does &s;uch a one
now &s;urvive, and &s;hall he not receive
<PB N="377" REF="386">
from you &s;ome portion of filial reverence
and honour? To di&s;regard and neglect
him, is to &s;purm your father's memory;
is to in&s;ult the a&s;hes of him who now
&s;leeps in the grave; is to tran&s;mit your|&s;elves
to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ucceed you, as
unfeeling and ba&s;e. <HI>Thine own friend,
and they father's friend, for&s;ake not.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE pointed out &s;ome of the chief
duties which belong to virtuous friend|&s;hip;

amid&s;t the pre&s;ent uncertainties of life.
Time and life are always going on, and

&s;tate. What the&s;e may be, whether for
the better or for the wor&s;e, we cannot tell;
<PB N="380" REF="389">

to cover futurity with a veil which
no mortal can lift up. In the mean time
none of us can avoid forming de&s;igns,
and laying plans, for the time to come.
The pre&s;ent moment is never &s;ufficient

apt to do, it becomes us to be di&s;ciplined
and prepared, for whatever it may bring.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="390">
It is needle&s;s to &s;pend much time in
confirming the truth, which is the foun|dation
of the admonition in the text; in
proving, either that change and mutability
belong to our pre&s;ent &s;tate, or that the
changes of it cannot be fore&s;een by us.
The&s;e are truths &s;o obvious and confe&s;|&s;ed,
that an attempt to confirm them is
like proving, that all men are to die. At
the &s;ame time, obvious as they are, it were
to be wi&s;hed, that the thoughts of men
dwelt upon them more. For, by a &s;trange
but prevailing deception, it would &s;eem,
from the general conduct of mankind,
that almo&s;t every one thinks his own ca&s;e
an exception from the general law; and
that he may build plans with as much
confidence on his pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as if
&s;ome a&s;&s;urance had been given him that
it were never to change. Hence it has
been often ob&s;erved by &s;erious per&s;ons,
that there is no more $eneral cau&s;e to
which the vices of men can be a&s;cribed,
their forgetfulne&s; of God and their ne|glect
of duty, than to their pre&s;uming
<PB N="382" REF="391">
upon the continuance of life, of plea&s;ure,
and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>Look but a little way, my friends, into
your own &s;tate; and you mu&s;t unavoid|ably
perceive that, from the beginning, it
has been &s;o contrived by Providence, that
there &s;hold be no permanent &s;tability to
man's condition on earth. The &s;eeds of
alteration are every where &s;own. In your
health, life, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, connections, plea|&s;ures,
there are cau&s;e of decay impercep|tible
working; &s;ecretly undermining the
foundations of what appears to you the
mo&s;t &s;table; continually tending, to abo|li&s;h
the pre&s;ent form of things, and to
bring forward new appearances, and new
objects in their order: So that nothing is
or can be, &s;tationary on earth. All chan|ges,
and pa&s;&s;es. It is a &s;tream which is ever turn|ing
round. When you behold the tree
covered with blo&s;&s;oms in the &s;pring, or
loaded with fruit in the autumn, as well
may you imagine, that tho&s;e blo&s;&s;om, or
that fruit, are to remain in their place
<PB N="383" REF="392">
through the whole year, as believe that
human affairs are to continue, for to-day
and to-morrow, for this year and the next,
proceeding in the &s;ame tenor.&mdash;To render
this reflection &s;till more &s;erious, think, I
pray you, on what &s;mall and incon&s;idera|ble
cau&s;es tho&s;e changes depend, which
affect the fortunes of men, throughout
their whole lives. How &s;oon is evil done!
There needs no great bu&s;tle or &s;tir, no long
preparation of events, to overturn what
&s;eems mo&s;t &s;ecure, and to bla&s;t what ap|pears
mo&s;t &s;louri&s;hing. A gale of wind
ri&s;es on the ocean; and the ve&s;&s;el which
carried our friends, or our fortunes, is o|verwhelmed
in the deep. A &s;park of a
candle falls by night in &s;ome neglected
corner; and the whole &s;ub&s;tance of fami|lies
is con&s;umed in flames before the
morning. A ca&s;ual blow, or a &s;udden
fall, deranges &s;ome of our internal parts;
and the re&s;t of life is di&s;tre&s;s and mi&s;ery.
It is awful to think, at the mercy of how
many &s;eeming contingencies we perpe|tually
<PB N="384" REF="393">
lie, for what we call happine&s;s in
this world.</P>
<P>In the mid&s;t, however, of all the&s;e ap|parent
contingencies, plans and de&s;igns
for the future are every day formed; pur|&s;uits
are undertaken; and life proceeds in
its u&s;u$l train. Fit and proper it is, that
life &s;hould thus proceed. For the uncer|tainty
of to-morrow was never di&s;igned
by Providence, to deter us from acting or
planning to day; but only to admoni&s;h
us, that we ought to plan, and to act, &s;ober|ly
and wi&s;ely.&mdash;What that wi&s;e and &s;ober
conduct is which becomes us, what the
rules and precautions are, which, in &s;uch
a &s;tate as ours, re&s;pect futurity, I now pro|ceed
to &s;how. They may be compre|hended
in the following directions. Boa&s;t
not thy&s;elf of to-morrow; De&s;pair not of
to-morrow; Delay not till to-morrow what
is proper to be done to day; Prepare thy|&s;elf
for whatever to-morrow may bring
forth; Build thy hopes of hapine&s;s on
&s;omething more &s;olid and la&s;ting than
<PB N="385" REF="394">
what either today or to-morrow will pro|duce.</P>
<P>I. IN the words of the text, <HI>Boa&s;t not
they&s;elf of to-morrow;</HI> that is, never pre|&s;ume
arrogantly on futurity; in the mo&s;t
fair and promi&s;ing &s;tate of fortune beware
of pride and vanity; beware of re&s;ting
wholly upon your&s;elves, and forgetting
Him who direct the changes of this mu|table
&s;tate. If there be any virtues, which
the uncertain condition of the world in|culcate
on man, they are, a&s;&s;uredly, mo|duration
and humility Man was, for
this end, placed in a world, where he
knows &s;o little of what is before him, that
he might be impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of his
dependence on the Ruler of the world;
that he might feel the importance of ac|quiring
favour and protection from Hea|ven.
by a li&s;e of piety and virtue; and
that, not knowing how &s;oon his own con|dition
may be the &s;ame with that of the
mo&s;t wretched, he might be prompted to
act towards all his brethren the humane
<PB N="386" REF="395">
and friendly part.&mdash;The favours which
Providence be&s;tows upon him at pre&s;ent,
he ought to receive with thankfulne&s;s,
and may enjoy with chearfulne&s;s. Though
commanded not to <HI>boa&s;t him&s;elf of to-morrow,</HI>
the meaning of the precept is not, that he
mu&s;t be &s;ad to day. Rejoice he may in
the day of pro&s;perity; but certainly, <HI>Re|joice
with trembling,</HI> is the in&s;cription that
&s;hould be written on all human plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As for them who, intoxicated with tho&s;e
plea&s;ures, become giddy and in&s;olent;
who, flattered by the illu&s;ions of pro&s;pe|rity,
make light of every &s;erious admoni|tion
which the changes of the world give
them, what can I &s;ay too &s;trong to alarm
them of their danger?&mdash;They have &s;aid
to them&s;elves, <HI>My mountain &s;tands &s;trong,
and &s;hall never be moved. To-morrow &s;hall
be as this day, and more abundantly. I &s;hall
never &s;ee adver&s;ity.</HI>&mdash;Ra&s;h and wretched
men! are you &s;en&s;ible how impious &s;uch
words are? To the world, perhaps you
dare not utter them; but they &s;peak the
&s;ecret language of your hearts. Know
<PB N="387" REF="396">
you are u&s;urping upon Providence; you
are &s;etting Heaven at defiance; you are
not only preparing &s;harper &s;tings for your|&s;elves,
when the changes of life &s;hall come,
but you are accelerating tho&s;e changes;
you are fa&s;t bringing ruin upon your own
heads. For God will not &s;uffer pride in
man; and the experience of all ages hath
&s;hown, how careful he is to check it. In
a thou&s;and memorable in&s;tances, the cour&s;e
of his government has been vi&s;ibly point|ed
again&s;t it. <HI>He &s;heweth &s;trenght with
his arm, and &s;cattereth the proud in the ima|ginations
of their hearts. The day of the
Lord is upon every one that is proud and

and to &s;tain the pride of all glory.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Luke i. 15. I&s;aiah. ii. 11. xxiii. 9.</NOTE> Some

II. as we are not to boa&s;t, &s;o neither
are we to de&s;pair, of to-morrow. The
former admonition was directed to tho&s;e
who pre&s;perity had elated with vain
hopes. This is de&s;igned for tho&s;e whom
a more adver&s;e &s;ituation in life has filled
with fears and alarms of what is to come.
The rea&s;on of both admonitions is the
&s;ame' <HI>thou knowe&s;t not what a day may
bring forth.</HI> It may bring forth &s;ome un|expected
misfortune; and therefore thou
&s;hould&s;t be humble in pro&s;perity. It may
bring forth &s;ome unfore&s;een relief; and
therefore thou &s;hould&s;t hope under di&s;|tre&s;s.
&mdash;It is too common with mankind,
to be totally engro&s;&s;ed, and overcome, by
pre&s;ent events. Their pre&s;ent condition,
whatever it is, they are apt to imagine,
will never change; and hence by pro&s;pe|rity
they are lifted up, and by adver&s;ity are
dejected and broken; prone, in the on
ca&s;e, to forget God, in the other, to re|pine
agan&s;t him. Whereas, the doctrine,
which the changes of the world pepetually
<PB N="389" REF="398">
inculcate is, that no &s;tate of external things
&s;hould, appear &s;o important, or &s;hould &s;o
affect and agitate our &s;pirits, as to deprive
us of a calm, an equal, and &s;teady mind.
Man knoweth neither the good, nor the
evil which is before him. In your <HI>patience,
therefore, po&s;&s;e&s;s your &s;ouls:</HI> tru&s;ting, in the
day of &s;orrow, that God hath not <HI>forgot|ten
to be gracious:</HI> and that <HI>though weep|ing
may endure for night, joy cometh to</HI>
the upright <HI>in the morning</HI></P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;s not your&s;elves, then, with an|xious
fears about to-morrow. Let me
exhort you to di&s;mi&s;s all &s;olicitude, which
goes beyond the bounds of prudent pre|caution.
Anxiety, when it &s;eizes the
heart is a dangerous di&s;ea&s;e, productive
both of much &s;in, and much mi&s;ery. It
acts as a corro&s;ive of the mind. It eats
out our pre&s;ent enjoyments, and &s;ub&s;ti|tutes
in there place, many an acute pain.
&mdash;The Wife Man, in the text, has advi&s;ed
us <HI>not to boa&s;t of to-morrow;</HI> and our Sa|viour
has in&s;tructed us to <HI>take no thought
<PB N="390" REF="399">
for to-morrow</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Matth. Vi. 33.</NOTE>. Both the&s;e directions,
properly under&s;tood, are entirely con&s;i&s;t|ent;
and the great rule of conduct, re|&s;pecting
futurity, is compounded of them
both; requiring us, neither arrogantly
to pre&s;ume on to-morrow, nor to be an|xiou&s;ly,
and fearfully &s;olicitous about it.
<HI>The morrow,</HI> &s;ays our Saviour, <HI>&s;hall take
$word$ for the things of it&s;elf.</HI> We &s;hall
be better able to judge of the cour&s;e mo&s;t
proper for us to hold, when events have be|gun
to come for ward in their order. Their
pre&s;ence often &s;ugge&s;ts wi&s;er coun&s;els, and
more &s;ucce&s;sful expedients, than it is po&s;|&s;ible
for us to contrive at a di&s;tance. By
exce&s;s of &s;olicitude before hand, we fre|quently
introduce that confu&s;ion of mind,
and that hurry and di&s;order of &s;pirits,
which bring us into the mo&s;t unfavour|able
&s;tate for judging &s;oundly.&mdash;Where|fore
never indulge either anxiety, or de|&s;pair,
about futurity. Affright not your|&s;elves
<PB N="391" REF="400">
with imaginary terrors. Antici|pate
not evil, which perhaps may never
come. Make the be&s;t which you can on
this day, in the fear of God, and in the
practice of your duty; and, having done
&s;o leave to-morrow to it&s;elf. <HI>Sufficient
for the day,</HI> when it comes, <HI>will be the evil
thereof</HI></P>
<P>III. DELAY not till to-morrow any thing
which is fit and proper to be done to-day.
Remember, that thou art not the lord of
to-morrow. Thou art &s;o far from having
any title to di&s;po&s;e of it, that thou art ig|norant
of the mo&s;t material circum&s;tances
relating to it; not only of what it &s;hall
bring forth, but whether thou &s;halt live to
&s;ee it.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding the uncontrover$ible
evidence of this truth, procra&s;tination
has, throughout every age, been the ruin
of mankind. Dwelling amid&s;t endle&s;s
projects of what they are hereafter to do,
they cannot &s;o properly be &s;aid to live, as
to be always about to live; and the fu|ture
has ever been the gulph in which the
<PB N="392" REF="401">
pre&s;ent is &s;wallowed up and lo&s;t.&mdash;Hence
ari&s;e many of tho&s;e misfortunes which be|fal,
men in their worldly concerns What
might at pre&s;ent be arranged in their cir|cum&s;tances
with advantage, being delay|ed
to another opportunity, cannot be ar|ranged
at all. To-morrow being loaded
with the concerns of to-day, in addition to
its own, is clogged and embarra&s;&s;ed. Af|fairs,
which had been po&s;tponed,: multi|ply
and crowd upon one another; till, at
la&s;t, they prove &s;o intricate and perplexed,
and the pre&s;&s;ure of bu&s;ine&s;s becomes &s;o
great, that nothing is le&s;t, but to &s;ink un|der
the burdern. Of him, therefore, who
indulges this lingering and delaying &s;pi|rit
in worldly matters, it is ea&s;y to prog|no&s;ticate
that the ruin is not far off.</P>
<P>Evils of the &s;ame kind, ari&s;ing from the
&s;ame cau&s;e, overtake men, in their moral
and &s;piritual intere&s;ts. There are few,
but who are &s;en&s;ible of &s;ome things in
their character and behaviour, which
ought to be corrected, and which, at one
time or other, they intend to correct;
<PB N="393" REF="402">
&s;ome head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ion, which de|&s;ign
to &s;ubdue; &s;ome bad habit, which they
purpo&s;e to reform; &s;ome dangerous con|nection,
which they are re&s;olved to break
off. But the convenient &s;ea&s;on for the&s;e
reformations is not yet come. Certain
ob&s;t, cles are in the way, which they ex|pect
by and by to &s;urmount; and there|fore
they go on in peace for the pre&s;ent,
in their u&s;ual cour&s;es, tur&s;ting, at a future
day to begin their de&s;igned improvement.
In the mean time the angel of death de|&s;cends;
and in the mid&s;t of their di&s;tant
plans, executes his commi&s;&s;ion, and carries
them away.&mdash;Guard again&s;t delu&s;ions of
this kind, which have been fatal to &s;o ma|ny.
&mdash;Thou art now in tranquillity, in
health, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a calm mind. Im|prove
the&s;e advantages, for performing all
that becomes thee, as a man, and as a
Chri&s;tian; for who can tell how long thou
&s;halt be permitted to enjoy them? New
alterations of fortune may be ju&s;t coming
forward; new troubles in public, or in
private life, about to ari&s;e new exigencies
<PB N="394" REF="403">
ready to throw thee into &s;ome condition
which &s;hall leave thee neither lei&s;ure nor
opportunity, to execute any of the good
purpo&s;es thou ha&s;t at pre&s;ent in thy mind.
Wherefore, trifle no longer with what is
&s;o &s;erious, and what may be &s;o critical;
but <HI>to day, while it is called to day,</HI> li&s;ten
to the voice of God, and do his works.
<HI>Do now,</HI> as the Wi&s;e Man advi&s;es, <HI>with
thy might what&s;oever thy band findeth to
do; for there is no work, nor device, nor
wi&s;dom, in the grave whether thou goe&s;t</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;. ix. 10.</NOTE>
&mdash;In&s;tead of delaying till to-morrow
what ought to be done to-day, let me ex|hort
you,</P>
<P>IV. To every day prepared for what|ever
to-morrow may bring forth. There
is a certain preparation for the vici&s;&s;itudes
of life, in which the multitude are &s;uffi|ciently
bu&s;ied providing, as they think, a|gain&s;t
whatever may happen, by increa&s;ing
<PB N="395" REF="404">
their riches, and &s;trengthening them&s;elves
by friends, connections, and worldly ho|nours.
But the&s;e bulwarks which they
erect, are totally in&s;u&s;ficient again&s;t the
drcaded &s;torm. it is to &s;ome other quar|ter
we mu&s;t look for our defence; for
when it is the world it&s;elf who&s;e changes
we have rea&s;on to dread, the world, and
the things of it, cannot afford us protec|tion.
The be&s;t preparation for all the
uncertainties of futurity con&s;i&s;ts, in a well
ordered mind, a good con&s;cience, and a
chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of Heaven.
You know not what &s;hall be on to-mor|row.
But there is One who knows it well;
for his decree hath fixed it. To him
look up with reverence; and &s;ay, <HI>&ldquo;Not
my will but thine be done;</HI> what thou ap|pointe&s;t
is ever wi&s;e, and ju&s;t and good.&rdquo;
Seek to fulfil the part which he hath a&s;|&s;igned
you; to do the things which he hath
commanded you to do; and leave all the
re&s;t to him. Whatever to-morrow brings
forth, let it find you employed <HI>in doing
<PB N="396" REF="405">
ju&s;tly, loving mercy, and walking humbly
with your God;</HI> and then you &s;hall meet
to-morrow without fear, when you meet
it without the upbraidings of guilt.</P>
<P>If if &s;hall bring forth to you any unex|pected
good, prepare to receive it with
gratitude, temperance, and mode&s;ty. If
it &s;hall bring forth evil, prepare to receive
it with manly fortitude. Let no events
of any kind, derange your equanimity, or
&s;hake your con&s;tancy. Contract your de|&s;ires,
and moderate your hopes. Expect
not more from the world than it is able to
afford you. Take it for granted that what
is naturally mutable, will one day change;
that what was de&s;igned to be tran&s;ient,
will pa&s;s away.&mdash;Look forward to futu|rity
without impatience. Be not de&s;irous
to know it. It belongs to God. Let him
bring forward the events of the world, in
his own way. Imagine that you conti|nually
hear tho&s;e words, which our Lord
once addre&s;&s;ed to Peter, when he was in|quiring
about what was to happen to a
fellow di&s;ciple, <HI>What is that to thee? Fol|low
<PB N="397" REF="406">
thou me.</HI> Amid&s;t all the uncertainty
of future events, this road of clear and
plain duty lies before you; follow chri&s;t,
and inquire no farther. Seek no crooked
path, in order to avoid impending dan|gers.
<HI>Turn not to the right hand, nor to
the left; but commit thy way unto the Lord;
tru&s;t al&s;o in him, and he &s;hall bring to pa&s;s
the de&s;ires of thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>V. BUILD your hopes of happine&s;s on
&s;omewhat more &s;olid and la&s;ting than
what either to-day or to-morrow are like|ly
to produce. From what has been &s;aid,
you may clearly perceive, that he who
re&s;ts wholly upon this world, builds his
hou&s;e upon the &s;and. This life, by means
of wi&s;dom and virtue, may be rendered to
a good man, a tolerable, nay a comfort|able,
&s;tate. But he who expects complete
happine&s;s from it, will be greatly deceived.
Man, in his mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition,
were much to be pitied, if he was de&s;ti|tute
of any higher hope. Rolling from
<PB N="398" REF="407">
change to change, throughout all the days
of his life, with a dark and unknown
pro&s;pect always before him in futurity,
what would avail a few &s;hort interrupted
glimp&s;es of happine&s;s which, from time to
time, he was permitted to enjoy? Can we
believe, that only for &s;uch a &s;tate as this,
man was de&s;igned by his great and good
Creator?&mdash;No: Let us <HI>ble&s;s the God and
Father of our Lord je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, accord|ing
to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us
again into a lively hope, by the re&s;urrection of
Chri&s;t from the dead, to an inheritance incor|ruptible,
undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</HI>
Here is the Rock on which the mind, howe|ver
to&s;t by the &s;torms of life, can &s;ecurely
re&s;t. Here is the object to which a wi&s;e
man will bend his chief attention, that, af|ter
having acted his part on earth with
fidelity and honour, he may be enabled,
through the merits of his Saviour, to look
for a place in the man&s;ions of eternal
and untroubled peace. This pro&s;pect is
the great corrective of the pre&s;ent vanity
of human life. It gives &s;ignificancy and
<PB N="399" REF="408">
importance to its mo&s;t tran&s;itory &s;cenes;
and, in the mid&s;t of its mutability, di&s;covers
one fixed point of re&s;t. He who is habi|tually
influenced by the hope of immorta|lity,
will be able to look without li&s;may
on the changes of the world. He will
neither boa&s;t of to-morrow, nor be afraid
of it; but will pa&s;s through the varieties
of life with a manly and unbroken mind;
with a noble &s;uperiority to tho&s;e fears and
expectations, tho&s;e cares and &s;orrows,
which agitate the multitude.&mdash;Such are
the native effects of Chri&s;tian faith and
hope. To them alone it belongs, to &s;ur|mount
all the di&s;couragements to which
we are now expo&s;ed; to render our life
comfortable, and our death ble&s;&s;ed; nay,
to make <HI>the day of our death better than the
day of our birth.</HI></P>

from its original purpo&s;e; and, in the pre|&s;ent
&s;tate of the world, has proved the
cau&s;e of much evil. For, as vice has a|bounded
in every age, it hath propaga|ted
it&s;elf much more ea&s;ily by the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of this &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition. We natu|rally
mould our&s;elves on the pattern of
prevailing manners; and corruption is
communicated from one to another. By
mutually giving, and taking, the example
of &s;inful liberties licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;preads
and grows; each ju&s;tifies him&s;elf by his
neighbour; and the multitude of &s;inners
&s;trengthen one another's hands to commit
iniquity. In all ages of the world, cu&s;tom
has had more power than rea&s;on.
Few take the trouble of inquiring what
is the right path; the greater part con|tent
them&s;elves with following that in
which the multitude have gone before
them. No exhortation, therefore, is more
nece&s;&s;ary to be frequently given, and to
be &s;eriou&s;ly enforced, than that which we
<PB N="402" REF="411">
receive from the text; <HI>Thou &s;halt not fol|low
a multitude to do evil.</HI></P>
<P>To acquire a full view of any danger
to which we are expo&s;ed, is the fir&s;t mea|&s;ure
to be taken, in order to our &s;afety.
Let us then begin the &s;ubject, with con&s;i|dering
how much we are in hazard of be|ing
mi&s;led into vice by the general man|ners
which we behold around us.&mdash;No
virtue is more nece&s;&s;ary to a Chri&s;tian,
but &s;carcely is there any more difficult
to be put in practice, than that firmne&s;s
of mind which can enable a man to main|tain
his principles, and to &s;tand his ground
again&s;t the torrent of cu&s;tom fa&s;hion and
example. Example has upon all minds a
&s;ecret and in&s;inuating influence, even
when we our&s;elves are in&s;en&s;ible of its ope|ration
We imperceptibly &s;lide into &s;ome
re&s;emblance of the manners of tho&s;e with
whom we have frequent intercour&s;e. This
often &s;hows if&s;elf, in the mo&s;t indifferent
things. But the re&s;emblance is &s;till more
readily contracted, when there is &s;ome|thing
<PB N="403" REF="412">
within our&s;elves, that leans to the
&s;ame &s;ide which is countenanced by the
practice of others. We are always glad
to find any apology for indulging our
inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions; and the exam|ple
of the multitude too readily &s;ugge&s;ts
that apology. Even before corruption
has made great progre&s;s in our hearts,
&s;ometimes, mere complai&s;ance and good
nature incline us to fall in with the ways
of others. Sometimes, timidity and fal&s;e
&s;hame prevent our differing from them:
Frequently, expectation and intere&s;t impel
us &s;trongly to comply, How great is the
danger we incur, when, in times of pre|vailing
vice, all the&s;e principles of imita|tion
and compliance unite together a|gain&s;t
our virtue?</P>
<P>The world is too ju&s;tly &s;aid by &s;cirp|ture,
to <HI>lie in wickedne&s;s.</HI> It is a &s;chool
wherein every vice is taught, and too ea|&s;ily
learned. Even from our earlie&s;t child|hood,
fal&s;e &s;entiments are in&s;tilled into
our minds. We are bred up in admira|tion
of the external &s;how of life. We are
accu&s;tomed, as &s;oon as we can under&s;tand
<PB N="404" REF="413">
any thing, to hear riches and honours
&s;poken of as the chief goods of men, and
propo&s;ed to us as the objects to which our
future pur&s;uits are to be directed. We
&s;ee the mea&s;ures of outward re&s;pect and
deference taken from the&s;e alone. Reli|gion
and virtue are recommended to us,
in a formal manner, by our teachers and
in&s;tructors; but all improvements of the
mind and heart, are vi&s;ibly placed by
the world, in an inferior rank to the ad|vantages
of fortune Vices, that chance
to be fa&s;hionable, are treated as &s;light fail|ings;
and coloured over, in common di&s;|cour&s;e,
with tho&s;e &s;oft and gentle names
which expre&s;s no condemnation. We en|ter,
perhaps, on the world, with good
principles, and an aver&s;ion to downright
vice. But when, as we advance in life,
we become initiated in that my&s;tery of ini|quity,
which is called, the way of the
world; when we meet with deceit and
artifice in all ranks of men; when we be|hold
iniquity authori&s;ed by great name,
and often rewarded with &s;ucce&s;s and ad|vancement,
<PB N="405" REF="414">
our original good impre&s;&s;ions
too &s;oon decay. The practice of the multi|tude
renders vice familiar to our thoughts;
and gradually wears off the abhorrence
with which we once beheld it. We begin
to think. that what is &s;o very general, can|not
be highly criminal. The malignity
of &s;in appears dimini&s;hed, by &s;o many be|ing
&s;harers in the reproach; and in&s;tead
of mens vices detracting, as they ought
to do from our good opinion of the men,
our attachment to the men oftener recon|ciles
us to the vices of which they are
guilty.</P>
<P>The countenance which &s;in receives
from the practice of the multitude, not
only removes the re&s;traints which are im|po&s;ed
by mode&s;ty and &s;hame; but, &s;uch
is the degeneracy of the world, that &s;hame
is too often employed again&s;t the cau&s;e of
religion and virtue. The ridicule of the
giddy and unthinking bears down he
conviction of the &s;ober and mode&s;t.
Again&s;t their own belief, they appear to
adopt the notions of the infidel; and a|gain&s;t
<PB N="406" REF="415">
their own choice, they join in the
vices of the libertine; that they may not
be reproached as per&s;ons of a narrow
mind, and &s;till en&s;laved to the prejudices
of education. How much rea&s;on is there
to believe theat, merely from this timidity
of temper, many, who&s;e principles are on
the &s;ide of religion and virtue, are never|thele&s;s
found <HI>walking in the way of &s;inners,
and &s;itting in the chair of the &s;cornful?&mdash;</HI>
Intere&s;t too, often coincides with this
weakne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, in tempting &s;uch
per&s;ons to follow the multitude. To fall
in with the prevailing ta&s;te, to &s;uit them|&s;elves
to the pa&s;&s;ions of the great, or to
the humours of the low, with whom they
chance to be connected, appears the rea|die&s;t
way to ri&s;e in the world. Hence
they are naturally led to relinqui&s;h the
firmne&s;s of an upright character, for that
&s;upple and ver&s;able turn, which accommo|dates
it&s;elf to the times, and a&s;&s;umes what|ever
appearance &s;eems mo&s;t convenient
for intere&s;t.&mdash;Such are the dangers to
which we are expo&s;ed, in times of corrup|tion
<PB N="407" REF="416">
of <HI>following the multitude to do evil;</HI>
dangers which require our mo&s;t &s;erious
attention and care, in order to guard our|&s;elves
again&s;t them.&mdash;I proceed to lay &s;uch
con&s;iderations before you as may be u&s;eful
for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, Let us remember that
the multitude are very bad guides; are &s;o
far from having a title to implicit regard,
that he who blindly follows them, may be
pre&s;umed to err. For prejudice, and pa&s;|&s;ion,
are known to &s;way the crowd. They
are &s;truck by the out&s;ide of things; they
inquire &s;uperficially, admire fal&s;e appear|ances,
and pur&s;ue fal&s;e goods. Their o|pinions
are for the mo&s;t part ha&s;tily form|ed,
and of cour&s;e are variable, floating,
and incon&s;i&s;tent. In every age, how &s;mall
is the number of tho&s;e who are guided
by rea&s;on, and calm inquiry? How few
do we find, who have the wi&s;dom to think
and judge for them&s;elves, and have &s;tea|dine&s;s
to follow out their own judgement?
<PB N="408" REF="417">
Ignorance, and low education, darken the
views of the vulgar. Fa&s;hion and pre|judice,
vanity and plea&s;ure, corrupt the
&s;entiments of the great. The example of
neither, affords any &s;tandard of what is
right and wi&s;e. If the philo&s;opher, when
employed in the pur&s;uit of truth. finds it
nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;regard e&s;tabli&s;hed preju|dices
and popular opinion, &s;hall we, in the
more importand inquiry after the rule of
life, &s;ubmit to &s;uch blind guidance as the
practice of the many; e&s;teeming whatever
they admire, and following wherever they
lead? Be a&s;&s;ured, that he who &s;ets up the
general opinion as the &s;tandard of truth,
or the general practice as the mea&s;ure of
right, is likely, upon &s;uch a foundation,
to build no other &s;uper&s;tructure except
vice and folly.&mdash;If the practice of the mul|titude
be a good pattern for our imitation,
their opinions &s;urely &s;hould be as good a
rule for our belief Upon this principle,
we mu&s;t exchange Chri&s;tianity for Paga|ni&s;in
or Mahometani&s;m, and the light of
the Reformation for the &s;uper&s;titions of Po|pery;
<PB N="409" REF="418">
for the&s;e latter have ever had, and
&s;till have, the numbers and the multitude
on their &s;de.&mdash;Our Saviour has &s;ufficient|ly
characteri&s;ed the way of the world,
when he de&s;cribes the <HI>broad, oad</HI> in which
the multitudes go, as the <HI>road which leads
to de&s;truction;</HI> and the path which leads to
happine&s;s, as a <HI>narrow path,</HI> which fewer
find. From which it is an ea&s;y interence,
that to have the multitude on our &s;ide, is
&s;o far from affording any pre&s;umption
of our being &s;afe, that is &s;hould lead us
to &s;u&s;pect that we are holding the cour&s;e
of danger.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, as the practice of
the multitude is no argument of a good
practice, &s;o it cannot afford us either ju&s;|tification,
or &s;afety, in what is evil.&mdash;It af|fords
us, I &s;ay, no ju&s;ti$ication. Truth
and error, virtue and vice, are things of
immutable nature. The difference be|tween
them is grounded on that ba&s;is of
eternal rea&s;on, which no opinions or cu&s;|toms
of men can a&s;fect or alter. Whether
<PB N="410" REF="419">
virtue be e&s;teemed, or not, in the world,
this makes it neither more nor le&s;s e&s;tima|ble
in it&s;elf. it carries always a divine
authority. which men cannot impair. It
&s;hines with an e&s;&s;ential lu&s;tre, which
prai&s;e cannot brighten, nor reproach tar|ni&s;h.
It has a right to regulate the opi|nions
of men; but by their opinions can|not
be controlled. Its nature continues
invariably the &s;ame, though all the mul|titude
of fools &s;hould concur in endea|vouring
to turn it into ridicule. <HI>Wo un|to
them,</HI> &s;ays the prophet I&s;aiah, <HI>that
call evil, good, and good, evil; that put
darkne&s;s for light, and light for darkne&s;s;
that put bitter for &s;weet, and &s;weet for bit|ter
&mdash;Their root &s;hall be as rottenne&s;s, and
their blo&s;&s;om &s;hall go up as du&s;t; becau&s;e they
have ca&s;t away the law of the Lord of bo&s;ts,
and de&s;pi&s;ed the word of the holy one of I&s;|rael</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah v. 20, 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As the practice of the multitude fur|ni&s;hes
<PB N="411" REF="420">
no ju&s;tification to the &s;inner, &s;o
neither does it afford him any $afety. Re|ligion
is altogether a matter of per&s;onal
concern. God hath delivered to every
man the rule of life; and every man mu$t
think and act for him&s;elf; becau&s;e for
him&s;elf he is to an&s;wer. If others be wic|ked,
it will be the wor&s;e for them; but
it will not, on that account, be the better
for us if we &s;hall be evil al&s;o. Let vice
be ever &s;o prevalent, it is &s;till that <HI>evil
thing which the Lord abhorreth;</HI> and,
<HI>though hand join in hand,</HI> the wicked &s;hall
not e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed. So far is the num|ber
of offenders from &s;urni&s;hing any
ground of &s;afety, that it calls more loudly
for divine ju&s;tice to interpo&s;e. It is as
ea&s;y for the Almighty arm to cru&s;h a
whole guilty &s;ociety, as to puni&s;h a &s;ingle
individual; and when the difobedient
&s;ubjects of God countenance and $trength|en
one another in licentiou&s;ne&s;s, by tran&s;|gre&s;fing
in troops and bands, it becomes
high time for his government to exert
it&s;elf, and let its vengeance forth.&mdash;One
<PB N="412" REF="421">
could &s;carcely think that any profe&s;&s;or of
Chari&s;tian faith would fancy to him&s;elf
any apology from the way6 of the world,
when he knows that the declared de&s;ign
of his religion was, to di&s;tingui&s;h him
from the world, which is &s;aid to <HI>lie in &s;in;</HI>
and that chri&s;t came to call out for him|&s;elf
a <HI>peculiar people, who&s;e</HI> character it
&s;hould be, <HI>not to be conformed to the world,
but transformed by the renewing of their
minds.</HI>&mdash;So little, indeed, can the practice
of the world either ju&s;tify or extenuate
vice, that it de&s;erves our &s;erious con&s;idera|tion,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, whether there bc
not &s;everal circum&s;tances, which peculiar|ly
aggravate the guilt of tho&s;e who follow
the multitude in evil. Do you not, there|by,
&s;trengthen the power of &s;in, and per|petuate
the pernicious influence of bad
example? by &s;triking off from the cor|rupted
crowd, you might be eminently
u&s;eful. You might animate and recover
many, whom weakne&s;s and timidity keep
<PB N="413" REF="422">
under bondage to the cu&s;toms of the
world; whereas, by tamely yielding to the
current of vice you render that current
&s;tronger for carrying others along; you
add weight and &s;tability to the bad cau&s;e;
you lend to the multitude all the force of
your example, for drawing others after
them, to the commi&s;&s;ion of evil.&mdash;While
you are thus acce&s;&s;ory to the ruin of o|thers,
you are, at the &s;ame time, &s;tamping
your own character with the foule&s;t and
deepe&s;t impre&s;&s;ions of corruption. By &s;ur|rendering
your judgement, and your con|&s;cience,
to the multitude, you betray the
rights, and degrade the honour, of the ra|tional
nature. Nothing great or worthy
can be expected of him, who in&s;tead of
con&s;idering what is right in it&s;elf, and
what part it is fitte&s;t for one in his &s;tation
to act, is only con&s;idering what the world
will think, or &s;ay of him; what &s;ort of
behaviour will pa&s;s with the faire&s;t &s;how,
and be mo&s;t calculated to plea&s;e the ma|ny.
When a man has thus given up the
<PB N="414" REF="423">
liberty and independence of his mind, we
can no longer reckon upon him in any
thing. We cannot tell how far he may be
carried in vice. There is too much ground
to dread, that he will lie, di&s;&s;emble, and be|tray;
changing him&s;elf, without &s;cruple,
into every &s;hape that will find favaour a|mong
tho&s;e whom he &s;eeks to gain.&mdash;
While this &s;ervility to the world infers
ba&s;ene&s;s towards men, it involves al&s;o the
highe&s;t impiety towards God. It &s;hows
that we yield to the world that reverence
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, which is only due to the
divine law. We treat the government of
the Almighty with &s;corn; as if his pre|cepts
de&s;erved to be obeyed, only when they
&s;uited the caprice and the follies of the
multitude; and were entitiled to no regard,
as &s;oon as they contradicted the reigning
cu&s;toms and fa&s;hions of the world.&mdash;
While &s;uch conduct carries in it &s;o much
wickedne&s;s and folly, let us ob&s;erve,</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fourth</HI> place, that mo&s;t excel|lent
and honourable character which can a|dorn
<PB N="415" REF="424">
a man and a chri&s;tian, is acquired,
by re&s;i&s;ting the torrent of vice, and adhe|ring
to the cau&s;e of God and virtue a|gain&s;t
a corrupted multitude. It will be
found to hold in general, that all tho&s;e,
who, in any of the great lines of life, have
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves for thinking pro|foundly,
and acting nobly, have de&s;pi&s;ed
popular prejudices, and departed, in &s;everal
things, from the common ways of the
world. On no occa&s;ion is this more re|qui&s;ite
for true honour, than where reli|gion
and morality are concerned. In times
of prevailing licentiou&s;ne&s;s, to maintain
unblemi&s;hed virtue, and uncorrupted in|tegrity;
in a public or a private cau&s;e, to
&s;tand firm by what is fair and ju&s;t, amid&s;t
di&s;couragements and oppo&s;ition; de&s;pi&s;ing
groundle&s;s cen&s;ure and reproach; di&s;dain|ing
all compliance with public manners,
when they are vicious and unlawful; and
never a&s;hamed of the punctual di&s;charge of
every duty towards God and man;&mdash;this
is what &s;hows true greatne&s;s of &s;pirit, and
will force approbation even from the dege|nerate
<PB N="416" REF="425">
multitude them&s;elves. &startq;This is

We may, thereby, render our&s;elves
more agreeable to &s;ome with whom we
are connected; and by artful complian|ces,
may plea&s;e our&s;elves with the pro&s;pect
of promoting our for&s;une. But the&s;e ad|vantages
&s;uch as they are, remain doubt|ful

leave us at a lo&s;s what cour&s;e to &s;teer;

conduct, into which a dependent on the

But &s;uppo&s;ing him &s;ucce&s;sful in his views,

principles to &s;erve the world. As long as

you compute the final amount, it will
prove a very &s;mall con&s;olation, that, as you
have had &s;harers in guilt, you &s;hall have
companions al&s;o in puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>Look forward to the i&s;&s;ue of things.
The multitude of men po&s;&s;e&s;s now, in a
great mea&s;ure, the di&s;tribution of prai&s;e
and cen&s;ure, of &s;ucce&s;s and di&s;appoint|ment,
according to their caprice. But this
confu&s;ed and promi&s;cuous di&s;tribution is
not always to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The day cometh,
when we all are to appear before a more
di&s;cerning Judge, and a more impartial
tribunal. The day cometh, when our
Lord Je&s;us chri&s;t, &s;hall de&s;eend from hea|ven
in all the glory of his Father, to un|veil
every character, and to <HI>render to every
man according to his works.</HI> At that day,
how &s;hall he lift up his head, who hath
been all his life the &s;lave of the world's
<PB N="421" REF="430">
opinion; who hath moulded his principles,
and his practice, &s;olely to plea&s;e the mul|titude;
who hath been <HI>a&s;hamed of his Sa|viour
and his words;</HI> and to gain favour
with men, hath apo&s;tati&s;ed from the na|tive
&s;entiments and dictates of his heart?
&mdash;To &s;ay all in one word; there is a con|te&s;t
now between God and the world.
The&s;e form the oppo&s;ite &s;ides which di|vide
mankind. Con&s;ider well, to which of
the&s;e you will chu&s;e to adhere. On the one
&s;ide, lie your allegiance, your honour, and
your intere&s;t; on the other, lie your
guilt and your &s;hame. For the one, con|&s;cience
and rea&s;on, for the other pa&s;&s;ion,
and inclination, plead. On the one hand,
are the approbation of God, immortal ho|nour,
and divine rewards; on the other,
&mdash;remember and beware,&mdash;are the &s;tings
of con&s;cience, endle&s;s puni&s;hment, and
endle&s;s infamy.</P>

<P>IT is of the highe&s;t importance to reli|gious
conduct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">SERM. XX.</NOTE> that our minds be fill|ed
with &s;uitable conceptions of the attri|butes
<PB N="423" REF="432">
butes of God. They are the foundations
of our reverence for him; and reverence is
the foundation of religion. All the di|vine
perfections are intere&s;ting to man.
Almighty power, in conjuction with E|ternity
and Omnipre&s;ence, naturally in|&s;pires
&s;olemn awe. Infinite Goodne&s;s re|lieves
the mind from the appre&s;&s;ion which
Power alone would produce; and, our
our experience of pre&s;ent benefits; and, from
remembrance of the pa&s;t, creates love, gra|titude,
and tru&s;t. In the middle between
the&s;e, &s;tands the contemplation of divine
Wi&s;dom, which conjoins impre&s;&s;ions of
awe with tho&s;e of comfort; and while it
humbles us into profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, en|courages,
at the &s;ame time our reliance on
that <HI>King eternal, immortal, and in$&s;ible,</HI>
who is ju&s;tly &s;tiled in the text, <HI>the only wi&s;e
God.</HI></P>
<P>Among men, wi&s;dom is a quality en|tirely
different from cunning or craft.
It always &s;uppo&s;es good and fair inten|tion
in the per&s;on who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; and
<PB N="424" REF="433">
imports, that laudable ends are pur&s;ued
by proper and ju&s;tifiable means. In like
manner, wi&s;dom in the Supreme Being
cannot be &s;eparated from the rectitude of
his nature. It is, in him, an exertion of
benevolence; and imports, that the pur|po&s;es
of ju&s;tice and goodne&s;s are carried
on and accompli&s;hed, by means the mo&s;t
effectual. To meditate, on &s;ome of tho&s;e
in&s;tances in which this divine wi&s;dom is
di&s;played, cannot but be highly favour|able
to the impre&s;&s;ions both of piety, and
of virtue.</P>
<P>IT is difficult to &s;ay whether the natu|ral,
or the moral, world, afford the mo&s;t
con&s;picuous and &s;triking di&s;plays of the
wi&s;dom of God. Not one, nor many di&s;|cour&s;es,
nor indeed the &s;tudy and labour of
a whole life, were, in any degree, &s;ufficient
to explore them. Of the proofs of wi&s;|dom
which the natural world affords, I
cannot attempt now to di&s;cour&s;e. Any
illu&s;tration of the&s;e would lead to di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions
of a &s;cientific kind, which more
<PB N="425" REF="434">
properly belong to the philo&s;opher; and
on which philo&s;ophy has often employed
it&s;elf, with much utility and honour. I
&s;hall only take notice that. in proportion
as human knowledge hath enlarged its
&s;phere of re&s;earch and di&s;covery, in the
&s;ame proportion, hath the wi&s;dom of the
Creator &s;truck the minds of all inquirers
and ob&s;ervers, with the highe&s;t admiration.
All nature is in truth &s;cene of wonders.
In the di&s;po&s;ition of the heavenly bodies,
and the general arrangement of the &s;y&s;tem
of the univer&s;e; in the &s;tructure of the
earth; in the endle&s;s variety of living
creatures that fill it; and in the provi&s;ion
made for them all, to enable them to fulfil
the ends of their being, it is not ea&s;y to
determine, whther power, wi&s;dom, or
goodne&s;s be mo&s;t con&s;picuous. It belongs
not only to <HI>the heavens to declare the glory
of God, and to the firmament to &s;hew forth
his handy-work;</HI> in the &s;malle&s;t and mo&s;t
incon&s;iderable, as well as in the mo&s;t il|lu&s;trious
works of God, equal marks ap|pear
or profound de&s;ign and con&s;ummate
<PB N="426" REF="435">
art. It has been ju&s;tly &s;aid, that there is
not a vegetable that grows, nor an infect
that moves, but what is &s;ufficient to con|found
the athei&s;t, and to afford the candid
ob&s;erver endle&s;s materials of devout ado|ration
and prai&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN we turn to the moral world,
the field of admiration which opens to us
is no le&s;s exten&s;ive and &s;triking. I can
only mention a few in&s;tances of that ex|qui&s;ite
wi&s;dom which everywhere meet
us.</P>
<P>In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, let us attend to the
con&s;titution of human nature. Though we
are taught by revelation, to con&s;ider it as
now impaired by the fall, yet, as it &s;tands,
we behold the traces of a noble &s;tructure,
planned and executed with the highe&s;t &s;kill.
All the powers and faculties be&s;towed on
man are &s;uch, as perfectly &s;uit his condition,
and adapt him to the purpo&s;es for which
he was de&s;igned&mdash;Sen&s;es were given him,
that he might di&s;tingui&s;h what is nece&s;&s;a|ry
for the pre&s;ervation and welfare of his
<PB N="427" REF="436">
body. Now, &s;uppo&s;e that any one of
tho&s;e &s;en&s;es, the fight, for in&s;tance, or the
hearing, or the touch, had been in a con|&s;iderable
degree either more blunt, or
more acute, than it is at pre&s;ent, what an
unhappy change would this have made
upon our &s;tate? On the one hand, greater
imperfection of the organs, would have
deprived us of all the comfort and advan|tage
which we now enjoy from &s;uch
powers. On the other hand, a greater de|gree
of exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;ibility in them, would
have rendered life a burden to us. Our
&s;en&s;es, in&s;tead of being inlets to know|ledge
and plea&s;ure, would then have be|come
con&s;tant avenues to unea&s;ine&s;s and
pain. their powers, therefore, are &s;kil|fully
adju&s;ted to that mea&s;ure of &s;trength,
which allows them to an&s;wer the purpo&s;es
of health, &s;afety, and comfort; without
either falling &s;hort of this line of u&s;eful|ne&s;s,
or improperly, and hurtfully, &s;tretch|ing
beyond it.</P>
<P>In the mind, appetites and pa&s;&s;ions
were placed, as the moving powers of the
<PB N="428" REF="437">
&s;oul, to impel its activity. But as their
impul&s;e required regulation and re&s;traint,
rea&s;on was, at the &s;ame time, conferred as
the directing power.&mdash;Of all our pa&s;&s;ions,
&s;elf-love, and the de&s;ire of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,
were, with the utmo&s;t propriety, made the
&s;tronge&s;t, for a rea&s;on which the meane&s;t
capacity may comprehend. Every man
is mo&s;t immediately committed by Provi|dence
to his own care and charge. He
knows his own &s;ituation be&s;t; and has
more opportunites of promoting his own
happine&s;s, than he can have of advan|cing
the happine&s;s of any other per&s;on.
It was therefore fit and wi&s;e, that, by
the &s;tronge&s;t in&s;tinct, he &s;hould be prompt|ed
to attend to him&s;elf.&mdash;At the &s;ame
time, as no man &s;tanding alone is &s;uf|ficient
for his own welfare, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that, by mutual &s;ympathy and
&s;ocial in&s;tincts, we &s;hould be drawn to
give aid to one another. Here it de&s;erves
our particular notice, that he force of
tho&s;e &s;ocial in&s;tincts is, with admirable
propriety, proportioned by Providence to
<PB N="429" REF="438">
the degree of their u&s;efulne&s;s and impor|tance<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. II. Vol. iii.</NOTE>.
Thus, that parental affection,
which the helple&s;s &s;tate of infancey and
childhood renders &s;o needful, is made the
&s;tronge&s;t of them all. Next, come tho&s;e ties
of blood, which prompt mutual kindne&s;s a|mong
tho&s;e who are intimately joined to|gether
by brotherhood, and other family
connections. To the&s;e &s;ucceeds that va|luable
in&s;tinct of pity, which impels us to
a&s;&s;i&s;t the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, wherever we behold
them. To take part with others in their
good fortune belongs to man's &s;ocial na|ture,
and increa&s;es the &s;um of happine&s;s.
At the &s;ame time, to take part with the
pro&s;perous is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary than to &s;ym|pathi&s;e
with the unhappy; and therefore
the principle which prompts us to <HI>rejoice
with them that rejofce,</HI> is made not to be
&s;o &s;trong, as that which impels us to <HI>weep
with them that weep.</HI></P>
<P>But they are not only the laudable and
important parts of our di&s;po&s;ition, which
<PB N="430" REF="439">
di&s;cover the wi&s;dom of the Author of our
frame; even our imperfections and fol|lies,
are by him rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to
u&s;eful ends.&mdash;Amid&s;t tho&s;e inequalities
of condition, for in&s;tance, which the &s;tate
of human life required, where it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that &s;ome &s;hould be rich, and o|thers
poor, that &s;ome &s;hould be eminent
and di&s;tingui&s;hed, and others ob&s;cure and
mean, how &s;ea&s;onable is that good opinion
which every one entertains of him&s;elf;
that &s;elf-complacency with which he com|pares
him&s;elf to others; and that fond
hope, which is ever plea&s;ing him with the
pro&s;pect of future plea&s;ures and advanta|ges
in life? Without tho&s;e flattering &s;en|&s;ations,
vain as they often are, how totally
in&s;upportable would this world become, to
many of its inhabitants? Whereas, by
means of them, Providence hath contrived
to balance, in a great mea&s;ure, the inequa|lities
of condition among mankind. It hath
contrived to diffu&s;e plea&s;ure through all
ranks; and to bring the high and the low
nearer to alevel with each other, than might
<PB N="431" REF="440">
at fir&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed. It hath &s;moothed the
mo&s;t rugged tracts of human life; and
hath gilded with rays of borrowed light
its mo&s;t dreary &s;cenes.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of Divine wi&s;dom, in
framing our nature, is &s;o remarkable as
to demand particular attention; that is,
the mea&s;ure according to which, God hath
di&s;pen&s;ed knowledge and ignorance to
man. There is nothing of which we are
more ready to complain, than of our nar|row
and confined views of nature, and of
Providence, and of all things around us:
And yet, upon examination, it will be
found, that our views extend, on every &s;ide,
ju&s;t as far as they ought; and that, to
&s;ee and know more than is allowed us, in|&s;tead
of bringing any advantage, would
produce certain mi&s;ery<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. IV. Vol. i. And Serm. IX. Vol.. iv.</NOTE>.&mdash;We pry, for
in&s;tance, with impatient curio&s;ity, into
future events. Happily for us, they are
veiled and covered up; and one peep be|hind
<PB N="432" REF="441">
that veil, were it permitted, would
be &s;ufficient to poi&s;on the whole comfort
of our days by the anticipation of &s;orrows
to come.&mdash;In like manner, we often wi&s;h
with eagerne&s;s to penetrate into the &s;ecrets
of nature, to look into the invi&s;ible world,
and to be made acquainted with the whole
de&s;tiny of man. Our wi&s;h is denied;
we are environed on all hands with my|&s;tery;
and that my&s;tery is our happine&s;s.
For were tho&s;e great invi&s;ible objects fully
di&s;clo&s;ed. the fight of them would con|found
and overwhelm us. It would ei|ther
totally derange our feeble faculties;
or would engro&s;s our attention to &s;uch
a degree, as to lay us a&s;ide from the bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and concerns of this world it would
have the &s;ame effect, as if we were carried
away form the earth, and mingled among
the inhabitants of &s;ome other planet.&mdash;
The knowledge that is allowed to us, was
de&s;igned to fit us for acting our part in
our pre&s;ent &s;tate. At the exact point
therefore, where u&s;efulne&s;s ends, know|ledge
&s;tops, and ignorance commences.
<PB N="433" REF="442">
Light &s;hines upon us, as long as it &s;erves
to guide our path; but for&s;akes us, as &s;oon
as it becomes noxious to the eye; and
&s;alutary darkne&s;s is appointed to clo&s;e the
&s;cene.&mdash;Thoughtle&s;s and &s;tupid mu&s;t that
man be, who, in all this furniture of the
human mind, in this exact adju&s;tment of
its &s;everal powers to the great purpo&s;es of
life, di&s;cerns not the hand of adorable
Wi&s;dom, as well as of infinite Coodne&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, Let us contemplate
the &s;ame wi&s;dom, as exhibiting it&s;elf to
us in the moral government of the world.
We are informed by revelation, that this
life is de&s;igned by providence to be an in|troductory
part of exi&s;tence to intelligent
beings; a &s;tate of education and di&s;ci|pline,
where creatures fallen from their
original rank, may gradually recover their
rectitude and virtue. Under this view,
which is in it&s;elf perfectly con&s;onant to
all that rea&s;on di&s;covers, we &s;hall find the
general cour&s;e of human affairs, confu&s;ed
as it may &s;ometimes appear, to have been
<PB N="434" REF="443">
been ordered with exqui&s;ite wi&s;dom.&mdash;It
was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch a &s;tate, that all the
active powers of man &s;hould be brought
forth into exerci&s;e, and completely tried.
It became proper, therefore, that there
&s;hould be a mixture of characters in the
world; and that men &s;hould be &s;hewn in
a variety of &s;ituations<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Se$ Serm. IV. Vol. iv.</NOTE> Hence that di|ver&s;ity
of tempers and di|&s;po&s;itions which
are found in &s;ociety; tho&s;e inequalities in
rank and &s;tation, which we &s;ee taking
place; and tho&s;e different talents and in|clinations,
which prompt men to different
pur&s;uits By the&s;e means, every depart|ment
in &s;ociety is filled up; and every man
has &s;ome &s;phere prepared for him, in
which he can act. He is brought forth
as on a bu&s;y &s;tage. Where opportunity
is given for his character to di&s;play it&s;elf
fu$ly.&mdash;His life is, with great propriety,
varied by interchanges of pro&s;perity and
adver&s;ity. Always pro&s;perous, he would
<PB N="435" REF="444">
become di&s;&s;ipated, indolent, and giddy:
Always a$eicted, he would be fretful, de|jected,
&s;ullen. There are few per&s;ons
therefore, or none, who&s;e lot &s;hares not of
both the&s;e &s;tates; in order that every di&s;|po&s;ition
of the heart may be explored,
and every mean of improvement afforded.
&mdash;As man is ultimately de&s;igned for a
higher &s;tate of exi&s;tence than the pre&s;ent,
it was not proper that this world &s;hould
prove a paradi&s;e to him, or &s;hould afford
him that complete &s;atisfaction which he
ince&s;&s;antly pur&s;ues. Di&s;appointments,
therefore, are often made to bla&s;t his
hopes; and, even while the comforts of
life la&s;t, they are always mixed with &s;ome
troubles; in order that an exce&s;&s;ive at|tachment
to this world may gradually be
loo&s;ened. The cour&s;e of things is evi|dently
&s;o ordered by Providence, that oc|curences
&s;hall be always happening, to
bring down the mo&s;t profperous to a le|vel
with the re&s;t of his brethren, and to
rai&s;e up, in their turn, the low and the
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed</P>
<P><PB N="436" REF="445">
In the mid&s;t of tho&s;e vici&s;&s;itudes, which
are &s;o obviou&s;ly conducive to improve|ment,
both wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s required,
that the &s;upreme Governor of the world
&s;hould be &s;een to protect the intere&s;ts, and
favour the &s;ide of virtue. But in the de|gree
of evidence, with which this was to
be &s;hown, it was no le&s;s requi&s;ite, that a
proper temperament &s;hould be ob&s;erved.
Had virtue been always completely re|warded,
and made happy on earth, men
would no longer have had a motive for
a&s;piring to a more ble&s;&s;ed &s;tate. In the
ca&s;e of every crime, had divine ju&s;tice
interpo&s;ed to bring complete puni&s;hment
on the head of the criminal; or had a$
the felicity which is prepared for the ju&s;t
in a future world, and all the mi&s;ery which
there awaits the wicked, been already di&s;|played
to the view, and rendered &s;en&s;ible
to the feeling of men, there would have
been an end of that &s;tate of trial, for which
our whole condition on earth was intend|ed.
It was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that, at
pre&s;ent, we &s;hould <HI>&s;ee through a gla&s;s
<PB N="437" REF="446">
darkly.</HI> A certain degree of my&s;tery and
ob&s;curity was, with perfect wi&s;dom, left
on the conduct of the Almighty<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Se Serm. IV. Vol. i.</NOTE>.&mdash;But,
amid&s;t that ob&s;curity, &s;ufficient encou|ragement
and &s;upport is in the mean time
given to virtue; &s;ufficient ground is afford|ed
for the full belief, that it is what the
Deity loves, and will finally reward. His
approbation of it is &s;ignified to every man
by the voice of con&s;cience. Inward &s;atis|faction
and peace are made always to be|long
to it; and general e&s;teem and ho|nour,
for the mo&s;t part, to attend it. On
the other hand, the wicked, in no &s;itua|tion
of life, are allowed to be truly happy.
Their vices and their pa&s;&s;ions are made to
trouble their pro&s;perity; and their pu|ni&s;hment
to grow out of their crimes.
Let any one attentively recollect the ma|terial
incidents of his life; and he will,
for the mo&s;t part, be able to trace the
chief misfortunes which have befallen
<PB N="438" REF="447">
him, to &s;ome guilt he has contracted, or
&s;ome folly he has committed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. XIII. iv.</NOTE>. Such
is the profound wi&s;dom with which Pro|vidence
conducts its coun&s;els, that, al|though
it does not appear to interpo&s;e,
men are made to reap from their actions,
the fruits which they had de&s;erved; their
iniquities <HI>to correct them, and their back|&s;lidings
to reprove them;</HI> and while they
&s;uffer, they are forced to acknowledge the
ju&s;tice of their puni&s;hment.&mdash;The&s;e are
not matters of rare or occa&s;ional ob&s;erva|tion;
but deeply interwoven with the
texture of human affairs. They di&s;cover
a regular plan, a formed &s;y&s;tem, according
to which the whole train of Providence
proceeds; and which manife&s;ts to every
&s;erious ob&s;erver the con&s;ummate wi&s;dom
of its Author.&mdash;As thus, in the con&s;titu|tion
of human nature, and in the moral
government of the world, divine wi&s;dom
&s;o remarkably appears, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><PB N="439" REF="448">
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, That in the redemp|tion
of the world, and in the oeconomy
of grace, it &s;hines no le&s;s con&s;picuou&s;ly.
The &s;ubject which opens to us here is too
exten&s;ive to be fully illu&s;trated at pre&s;ent;
but the great lines of it are obvious<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. V. Vol. i.&mdash;Serm. V. Vol. ii.&mdash;Serm. XV. Vol. iii.&mdash;Serm. V. Vol. iv.</NOTE>.&mdash;In
carrying on a plan, by which forgive|ne&s;s
was to be di&s;pen&s;ed to an offending
race, wi&s;dom required that the authority
of the legi&s;lator &s;hould be fully pre&s;erved,
and no &s;uch relaxation be introduced in|to
government, as might give licence or
encouragement to offenders. According|ly,
the mo&s;t admirable provi&s;ion was
made for the&s;e important purpo&s;es, by the
interpo&s;ition of the Son of God &s;uffering
and dying for &s;inners. The &s;overeign
awe of ju&s;tice is maintained, while ju&s;|tice
is tempered with mercy. Men are
bound to righteou&s;ne&s;s, under the highe&s;t
&s;anctions; and ample &s;ecurity and con|&s;olation
<PB N="440" REF="449">
&s;olation are, at the &s;ame time, a&s;&s;orded to
the penitent. By the in&s;tructions, and
example, of their Saviour, they are in|&s;tructed
in their duty; and through a
Mediator and Interce&s;&s;or, they are en|couraged
to o&s;&s;er their wor&s;hip and pray|ers
to the Almighty. They are a&s;&s;ured
that, in whatever is too arduous for hu|man
nature to perform, they &s;hall be a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
by a Divine Spirit; and under all
trials and di&s;&s;iculties, they are &s;upported
by the expre&s;s promi&s;e of the eternal life,
which is brought to light by the go&s;pel.
&mdash;It is not po&s;&s;ible for the under&s;tanding
to conceive any menthod of &s;alvation, plan|ned
with more goodne&s;s, and executed
with more wi&s;dom, than what is &s;hown
in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. the con&s;$dera|tion
of this con&s;titution alone, gives us
full rea&s;on to join in that exclamation of
the Apo&s;tle; <HI>O the depth of the riches both
of the wi&s;dom and the knowledge of God!
How un&s;earchable are his judgements, and
his ways pa&s;t $inding out!</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Rome. ii. 33.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="441" REF="450">
FROM this &s;hort &s;urvey which we have
taken of Divine wi&s;dom, as di&s;covering
it&s;elf, in the whole complex frame of the
moral world; in the con&s;titution of hu|man
nature; in the government of hu|man
affairs; and in the redemption of
the human race; we cannot but perceive
how much rea&s;on we have to pro&s;trate
our&s;elves before God, and with all humi|lity
to wor&s;hip and adore.&mdash;When we
view that immen&s;e &s;tructure of the uni|ver&s;e
in which we dwell; when we think
of Him, who&s;e wi&s;dom has planned the
whole &s;y&s;tem of being; who&s;e mind com|prehends,
who&s;e coun&s;els direct, the whole
cour&s;e of events, from the beginning to the
end of time; by whom nothing is &s;o in|con&s;iderable
as to be overlooked, or &s;o
tran&s;ient as to be forgotten; who attends
to the concerns of the poor man in his
cottage, while he is &s;teering the &s;un and
the moon in their cour&s;e through the
heavens; into what a&s;toni&s;hment and
&s;elf-annihilation do we fall! Before him
all our boa&s;ted knowledge is ignorance,
<PB N="442" REF="451">
and our wi&s;dom is folly. Wherever we
ca&s;t our eyes on his works and ways, we
find all things adju&s;ted in <HI>number, weight,
and mea&s;ure;</HI> and after all that we can
&s;urvey, Lo! the&s;e are but a part of his
ways; <HI>and how &s;mall a portion is heard of
him!</HI></P>
<P>It is the power of God, which produces
among the multitude of men any impre&s;|&s;ion
of religion. When thunder roars
in the heavens, or an earthquake &s;hakes
the ground, they are &s;truck with awe, and
di&s;po&s;ed to wor&s;hip an invi&s;ible power.
But &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions of Deity are occa|&s;ional,
and tran&s;itory. The la&s;ting reve|rence
of a Supreme Being ari&s;es, in a well
informed mid, from the di&s;play of that
infinite wi&s;dom which all the univer&s;e
pre&s;ents. Its operations are con&s;tantly,
though &s;ilently, going on around us.
We may view it in the peaceful and &s;e|date
&s;tate of the univer&s;e, as well as in its
greate&s;t commotions; we behold it in e|very
in&s;ect that moves on the ground, at
the &s;ame time that we admire it in the
<PB N="443" REF="452">
revolutions of the cele&s;tial bodies. Hap|py
for us, if the contemplation &s;hall nou|ri&s;h
that temper of habitual devotion,
which &s;o well becomes dependent beings,
and is &s;o intimately connected with all
virtue<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Serm. xix. vol. iii.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>But the chief effect that ought to be
produced by meditation on the divine
wi&s;dom, is perfect re&s;ignation to the Go|vernor
of the univer&s;e, and entire tru&s;t
in his admini&s;tration. Our private mi&s;|fortunes
and di&s;appointments are too often
the &s;ubject of querulous complaints. and
even of unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions of Providence.
But when in the whole natural and mo|ral
world, we behold an arrangement of
things which plainly di&s;covers the mo&s;t
con&s;ummate wi&s;dom, can we believe, that
in the arrangement of our petty concerns,
this wi&s;dom is dormant and neglectful?
How much more rea&s;on is there to think,
that our ignorance of the divine plans
mi&s;leads our judgement, than that the
<PB N="444" REF="453">
wi&s;dom of the Almighty has erred in di|recting
our private affairs?&mdash;Divine
wi&s;dom, as I ob&s;erved in the beginning,
is an exertion of divine benevolence. It
has, it can have, not other &s;cope than to
accompli&s;h the be&s;t ends, by the mo&s;t
proper means. Let the Wi&s;dom, there|fore
and the Goodne&s;s, of the deity, be
ever conjoined in our idea. Let every
new di&s;covery of divine wi&s;dom, be a
new ground of hope, of joy, and of cor|dial
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, to every virtuous man.
Let him be thankful that he lives in a
world, where nothing happens to him by
chance, or at random; but where a great
a wi&s;e, and beneficent Mind continually
&s;uperintends every event.</P>
<P>Under the faith of this great principle
of religion, let us proceed in the cour&s;e
of our duty, with &s;tedfa&s;t and undi&s;may|ed
mind. Let us retain faithful allegi|ance
to our Creator and our Redeemer;
and then we may always hope the be&s;t;
and <HI>ca&s;t our care upon him who careth for
us. Wait on the Lord; be of good courage,
<PB N="445" REF="454">
and He &s;hall &s;trengthen your heart. Al|though
thou &s;aye&s;t, thou can&s;t not &s;ee him, yet
judgement is before him; therefore tru&s;t thou
in him.</HI>&mdash;Let us begin every undertak|ing,
with humble dependence on his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
for enabling us to pro&s;ecute it to
the end. When our undertakings are fi|ni&s;hed,
and the clo&s;e of life approaches,
with prai&s;e to him let us conclude all our
labours.</P>
<P><HI>Unto the king Eternal, immortal, invi&s;i|ble,
the only Wi&s;e God, be honour and glory
for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
