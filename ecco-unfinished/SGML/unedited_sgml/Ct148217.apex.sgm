<P>THE following pages are the re&s;ult of an attempt to compre&s;s and arrange tho&s;e arguments, which coming from a great State&s;man, on a momentous and &s;ea&s;onable &s;ubject, have not failed already to obtain, as they de&s;erve, an extraordinary &s;hare of public attention. However, the Editor under&s;tands from all quarters, that there &s;till remain a very con|&s;iderable number to whom the &s;ub&s;tance would be acceptable in a &s;maller compa&s;s. Neither is it any impeachment of the admirable original to &s;ay, what Mr. Burke him&s;elf has &s;aid in the preface, that being written for private u&s;e, in the form of a letter, the arguments do not, perhaps, follow in that regular order which is be&s;t adapted to common ap|prehen&s;ion. When brought into one view, they &s;peak for them&s;elves, in an&s;wer to all cavils upon the &s;ubject; and evince that there exi&s;ts, independently of foreign or que&s;tionable matter, an entire body of rea&s;oning proof again&s;t the attack of heedle&s;s or par|tial critici&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="3">
Ever &s;ince the work fir&s;t appeared the National A&s;&s;embly has been confirming its truth; betraying more and more tho&s;e principles by which the author had proved that they were actuated. Le&s;t any doubt might remain of their &s;u&s;pected de&s;ign <HI>of aboli&s;hing the Chri&s;tian Religion,</HI> by bringing its mini&s;ters into contempt, their la&s;t proceedings have been per|fectly explicit and unequivocal. By a cruel and ma|licious refinement upon tyranny, they have at length reduced the clergy to this terrible alternative; either with a &s;olemn oath to ratify the de&s;truction of their church, or to e&s;cape from its ruins, committing what remains to mercenaries, who having lo&s;t their character, have lo&s;t, when the la&s;t &s;troke comes to be made, their only principle of &s;ecurity! The A&s;|&s;embly well knows that in &s;uch hands Chri&s;tianity lies entirely at their mercy.</P>
<P>And let the Engli&s;h reader beware how he con&s;i|der him&s;elf an unconcerned &s;pectator: nor when he reads of an intriguing monied intere&s;t con&s;piring with a re&s;tle&s;s literary cabal again&s;t the religion and property of their country, let him &s;light too ha&s;tily that advice of Mr. Burke, <Q>&startq;At home we behold &s;imilar beginnings, we &s;hould be on our guard again&s;t &s;imilar conclu&s;ions.&endq;</Q></P>

<HEAD>AN ABRIDGMENT, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1">
<HEAD>I. <HI>The conduct of tho&s;e Clubs in England which have recommended to us the example of France.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU &s;ee by the Letter that I have tran&s;mitted to you, that, though I do mo&s;t heartily wi&s;h that France may be animated by a &s;pirit of rational liberty, it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning &s;ome material points in your late tran&s;|action.</P>
<P>You imagined, when you wrote la&s;t, that I might po&s;&s;ibly be reckoned among the approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the &s;olemn public &s;eal of &s;anction they have received, from two Clubs of Gentlemen in London called the Revolution Soci|ety, and the Con&s;titutional Society.</P>
<P>For one, I &s;hould be &s;orry to be thought directly or indirectly concerned in their proceedings.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5">
I &s;hould think it at lea&s;t improper and irregular for me to open <HI>a formal public corre&s;pondence with the actual government of a foreign nation,</HI> without the expre&s;s authority of the government under which I live.</P>
<P>I &s;hould be &s;till more unwilling to enter into that corre&s;pondence, <HI>under any thing like an equivocal de|&s;cription,</HI> which to many unacquainted with our u&s;ages, might make the addre&s;s in which I joined, appear the act of per&s;ons in &s;ome &s;ort of corporate capacity, acknowledged by the laws of this king|dom, and authorized to &s;peak the &s;en&s;e of &s;ome part of it&mdash;a policy that has very much the com|plection of a fraud.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be tolerably &s;ure too, before I venture publicly to congratualte men on a ble&s;&s;ing, that they have <HI>really</HI> received one. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they plea&s;e. We ought to &s;ee what it will plea&s;e them to do, be|fore we ri&s;que congratulations which may be &s;oon turned into complaints.</P>
<P>I &s;hould therefore &s;u&s;pend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with mo|rality and religion; with the &s;olidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and &s;ocial man|ners. All the&s;e (in their way) are good things too; and without them, liberty is not a benefit whil&s;t it la&s;ts, and is not likely to continue long.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations, however, were below the dignity of the Revolution Society; but now that we
<PB N="7" REF="6">
are in a condition to di&s;cern the true nature of the object held up to our attention, their de&s;ign of draw|ing us into an imitation of the National A&s;&s;embly of France gives me a con&s;iderable degree of unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2">
<HEAD>II. <HI>The nature of that example which the French have given us.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Is our monarchy, after their example, to be anni|hilated, with all the laws, all the tribunals, and all the ancient corporations of the kingdom? Is every landmark of the country to be done away, in favour of a geometrical and arithmetical con&s;titution? Is the Hou&s;e of Lords to be voted u&s;ele&s;s? Is epi&s;co|pacy to be aboli&s;hed? Are the church lands to be &s;old to Jews and jobbers, or given to bribe new-in|vented municipal republics into a participation in &s;acrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances, and the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic pre&s;ents? Are &s;ilver &s;hoe-buckles to be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the land tax and the malt tax for the &s;upport of the naval &s;trength of this king|dom? Are all orders, ranks, and di&s;tinctions to be confounded, that univer&s;al anarchy may ari&s;e out of national Bankruptcy? For this great end is the army to be &s;educed from its di&s;cipline and its fidelity; fir&s;t by every kind of debauchery, and then by the terrible precedent of a donative in the increa&s;e of pay? Are the curates to be &s;educed from their bi&s;hops by holding out to them the delu&s;ive hope of a dole out of the &s;poils of their own order? Are the citi|zens of London, like tho&s;e of Paris, to be drawn
<PB N="8" REF="7">
from their allegiance by feeding them at the expence of their fellow &s;ubjects? Is a compul&s;ory paper cur|rency to be &s;ub&s;tituted in the place of the legal coin of this kingdom? Is what remains of the plundered &s;tock of public revenue, to be employed in the wild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with one another?&mdash;If the&s;e are the ends and means of the Revolution Society, I admit they are well a&s;&s;orted; and France may fur|ni&s;h them for both with precedents in point.</P>
<P>I am no &s;tranger to the faults and defects of the &s;ubverted government of France; but is it true, that the French government was &s;uch as to be utterly incapable of reform? All France was of a different opinion in the beginning of the year 1789. The in&s;tructions to the repre&s;entatives of the States Gene|ral, from every di&s;trict in that kingdom, were filled with projects for the <HI>refermation</HI> of that government, without the remote&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of <HI>a de&s;ign to de|&s;troy it.</HI> The true que&s;tion at pre&s;ent is, whether tho&s;e who have de&s;troyed, or tho&s;e who would have reformed, are in the right? Upon a free con&s;titu|tion there was but one opinion in France. All the &s;truggle, all the di&s;&s;ention aro&s;e afterwards. The triumph of the victorious party was over the prin|ciple of a <HI>Briti&s;h Con&s;titution.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>1&s;t. Re&s;pecting the Con&s;titution of their Legi&s;lature.</HEAD>
<P>We have a right therefore to expect that &s;ome very unu&s;ual appearances of wi&s;dom will di&s;play them&s;elves on the face of the de&s;igns of tho&s;e who
<PB N="9" REF="8">
appeal to no practice, and who copy after no model. Has any &s;uch been manife&s;ted? Let us examine, fir&s;t, the Con&s;titution of their Legi&s;lature. Here your new Con&s;titution is the very rever&s;e of ours in its principle. The Member who goes to the National A&s;&s;embly is not cho&s;en by the people, nor accoun|table to them. There are three elections before he is cho&s;en; two &s;ets of magi&s;tracy intervene between him and the A&s;&s;embly; &s;o that the whole &s;pirit of election is changed, and there is no way to make a connection between the original con&s;tituent and the repre&s;entative. Every man who has &s;erved in an a&s;&s;embly is ineligible for two years after. Ju&s;t as the&s;e magi&s;trates begin to learn their trade, they are di&s;qualified for exerci&s;ing it. Your Con&s;titution has too much of jealou&s;y to have much of &s;en&s;e in it:&mdash;You con&s;ider the breach of tru&s;t in the repre&s;entative &s;o principally, that you do not at all regard the que&s;|tion of his fitne&s;s to execute it.</P>
<P>In order to &s;ecure a &s;teady and moderate conduct in &s;uch a&s;&s;emblies, it is nece&s;&s;ary that the body of them &s;hould be re&s;pectably compo&s;ed, in point of condition of life, of permanent property, of education, and of &s;uch habits as enlarge and liberalize the under&s;tanding. In the calling of the States General of France, the fir&s;t thing which &s;truck me was a great departure from the ancient cour&s;e. I found the repre&s;entation of the Third E&s;tate, compo&s;ed of &s;ix hundred per&s;ons: they were equal in number to the repre&s;entation of both the other orders: now as the orders were not to act &s;eparately, but to be melted down into one, the
<PB N="10" REF="9">
policy of this numerous repre&s;entative became obvi|ous; a very &s;mall de&s;ertion from either of the other two orders mu&s;t throw the power of both into the hands of the third. In fact, the whole power of the State was &s;oon re&s;olved into that body. But, it is an&s;wered, the repre&s;entation of twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred thou&s;and. True; if the con&s;titution of a kingdom be a problem of arithmetic. However, a government of five hun|dred country attornies and ob&s;cure curates is not good for twenty-four millions of men, though it were cho&s;en by eight millions; nor is it the better for being guided by a dozen of per&s;ons of quality, who have betrayed their tru&s;t in order to obtain that power; for &s;uch in general is the compo&s;ition of the governing majority of the National A&s;&s;embly, which I can never con&s;ider as any thing el&s;e than a voluntary a&s;&s;ociation of men, who have availed them|&s;elves of circum&s;tances to &s;eize upon the power of the State, and in which is &s;carcely to be perceived the &s;lighte&s;t trace of what we call the natural landed intere&s;t of the country.</P>
<P>This A&s;&s;embly, which overthrows kings and kingdoms, has not even the phy&s;iognomy and a&s;pect of a grave legi&s;lative body; they act like the come|dians of a fair before a riotous audience; they act amid&s;t the tumultuous cries of a mixed mob of fero|cious men and of women lo&s;t to &s;hame, who, accor|ding to their in&s;olent fancies, direct, controul, ap|plaud, explode them; and &s;ometimes mix and take their &s;eats among&s;t them. Who is it that admires
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and from the heart is attached to national repre&s;enta|tive a&s;&s;emblies, but mu&s;t turn with horror and di&s;gu&s;t from &s;uch a profane burle&s;que, and abominable per|ver&s;ion of that &s;acred in&s;titute.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2">
<HEAD>2. <HI>Their Executive Power.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Let us turn then our eyes to what they have done towards the formation of an executive power. For this they have cho&s;en <HI>a degraded king.</HI> This their fir&s;t executive officer is to be a machine without any &s;ort of deliberative di&s;cretion in any one act of his function. The King of France is not the fountain of ju&s;tice. A thou&s;and times better it had been for this unappy prince if he had nothing at all to do with its admini&s;tration; deprived as he is of all that is venerable and all that is con&s;olatory in that function, without a power of originating any proce&s;s; without a power of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, mitigation, or pardon.</P>
<P>He is no more the fountain of honour, than he is of ju&s;tice. All rewards, all di&s;tinctions are in other hands. He has no negative; yet his name and au|thority mu&s;t be u&s;ed to enforce every har&s;h decree. Nay, he mu&s;t concur in the butchery of tho&s;e who &s;hall attempt to free him from his impri&s;onment. A king, circum&s;tanced like the pre&s;ent, can have no generous intere&s;t to excite him to action. To infe|rior people &s;uch an office might be a matter of ho|nour&mdash;but to be rai&s;ed to it, and to de&s;cend to it, are different things, and &s;ugge&s;t different &s;entiments.</P>
<P>Is the conduct of a war to be tru&s;ted to a man who may abhor its principle; who, in every &s;tep he
<PB N="12" REF="11">
takes to render it &s;ucce&s;sful, confirms the power of tho&s;e by whom he is oppre&s;&s;ed? Will foreign States &s;eriou&s;ly treat with him who has no prerogative of peace or war? No, not &s;o much as in a &s;ingle vote by him&s;elf, or his mini&s;ters, or by any one whom he can po&s;&s;ibly influence.</P>
<P>Does he <HI>really</HI> name the mini&s;ters? they will have a &s;ympathy with him. Are they forced upon him? The whole bu&s;ine&s;s between them, and the nominal king will be mutual counteraction. The Mini&s;ters of State in France are the only per&s;ons in that coun|try who are incapable of a &s;hare in the national coun|cils. What mini&s;ters! what councils! what a nation!</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3">
<HEAD>3. <HI>In their Judicature.</HI></HEAD>
<P>As little genius and talent am I able to perceive in the plan of judicature formed by the National A&s;|&s;embly. In&s;tead of in$itating your monarchy, and &s;eating your judges on a bench of independence, your object is to reduce them to the mo&s;t blind obedience. As you have changed all things, you have invented new principles of order. You fir&s;t appoint judges, who, I &s;uppo&s;e, are to determine according to law, and then you let them know, that <HI>at &s;ome time or other</HI> you intend to give them &s;ome law by which they are to determine. Any &s;tudies which they have made (if any they have made) are to be u&s;ele&s;s to them: they know not by what law they judge, nor under what authority they act, nor by what te|nure they hold. They thus become complete, and
<PB N="13" REF="12">
mo&s;t dangerous in&s;truments in the hands of the go|verning power, which, in the mid&s;t of a cau&s;e or on the pro&s;pect of it, may wholly change the rule of deci&s;ion.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="4">
<HEAD>4. <HI>In their Army.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Has more wi&s;dom been di&s;played in the con&s;titu|tion of your army, than what is di&s;coverable in your plan of judicature? Truly it is not very ea&s;y to di|vine what that army may become at la&s;t. You have got the wolf by the ears, and I wi&s;h you joy of the happy po&s;ition in which you have cho&s;en to place your&s;elves, and in which you are well circum&s;tanced for a free deliberation, relatively to that army, or to any thing el&s;e. You &s;eem to have given the provi|&s;ional nomination of the officers, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to the King, with a re&s;erve of approbation to the National A&s;&s;embly. This double negotiation for military rank &s;eems to me a contrivance as well adapted, as if it were &s;tudied for no other end, to promote faction in the A&s;&s;embly it&s;elf, relative to this va&s;t military patronage; and then to poi&s;on the corps of officers with factions of a nature &s;till more dangerous to the &s;afety of government, and de&s;truc|tive in the end to the efficiency of the army it&s;elf. Tho&s;e officers, who lo&s;e the promotions, intended for them by the Crown, mu&s;t become of a faction oppo&s;ite to the A&s;&s;embly. On the contrary, tho&s;e officers, who carry their point through an intere&s;t in the A&s;&s;embly, mu&s;t &s;light in the Crown an autho|rity
<PB N="14" REF="13">
which would not advance and could not retard their promotion.</P>
<P>It is be&s;ides to be con&s;idered, whether an A&s;&s;em|bly like yours, is fit for promoting the obedience and di&s;cipline of an army. It is known that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedience to any &s;enate or popular authority; and they will lea&s;t of all yield it to an a&s;&s;embly which is to have a continuance only of two years. In the weakne&s;s of one kind of authority and the fluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for &s;ome time mutinous and full of faction, until &s;ome popu|lar General &s;hall draw the eyes of all men upon him|&s;elf. Armies will obey him on his per&s;onal account. There is no other way of &s;ecuring military obedience in this &s;tate of thing. But the moment in which that event &s;hall happen, <HI>the per&s;on who really com|mands the army is your ma&s;ter.</HI></P>
<P>How came the A&s;&s;embly by their pre&s;ent power over the army? Chiefly, to be &s;ure, by debauching the &s;oldiers from their officers. They have begun by a mo&s;t terrible operation. They have de&s;troyed the principle of obedience; that &s;ubordination on which the whole military &s;y&s;tem depends&mdash;the &s;ol|dier is told, he is a citizen, and has the rights of man and citizen. The right of man, he is told, is to be his own governor, and to be ruled only by tho&s;e to whom he delegates that &s;elf-government. It is very natural he &s;hould think, that he ought, mo&s;t of all, to have his choice where he is to yield the greate&s;t degree of obedience. The Secretary at
<PB N="15" REF="14">
War informs the A&s;&s;embly, with affected a&s;toni&s;h|ment, that the regiments pay no regard to oaths. The A&s;&s;embly then propo&s;e&mdash;what? more oaths. They renew decrees and proclamations as they ex|perience their inefficiency, and they multiply oaths in proportion as they weaken, in the minds of men, the &s;anctions of religion. I hope that handy abridge|ment of the excellent &s;ermons of Voltaire, d'Alem|bert, Diderot, and Helvetius, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Certain infidel writers.</NOTE> on the immortality of the &s;oul, on a particular &s;uperintending Provi|dence, and on a future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;h|ments, are &s;ent down to the &s;oldiers along with their civic oaths. Of this I have no doubt. All your re|&s;olutions, all your proceedings, all your debates, all the works of your doctors in religion and politics are put into their hands, and you expect that they will apply to their own ca&s;e ju&s;t as much of your doctrines and examples as &s;uits your plea&s;ure. This military aid can only la&s;t for a time, whil&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of the increa&s;e of pay remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all di&s;putes is &s;lattered.</P>
<P>As to the municipal army or militia, which is to balance this national army, that is a mon&s;ter which, having neither coherency nor connection with the other parts of your &s;y&s;tem, cannot fail to terminate its perplexed movements in &s;ome great national calamity.</P>
<P>Having concluded my few few remarks on the Con&s;titution of the Supreme Power, the Executive, the Judicature, and the Military, I &s;hall &s;ay &s;ome|thing of your revenue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="5">
<PB N="16" REF="15">
<HEAD>5. <HI>In their Finance.</HI></HEAD>
<P>To fill up all the deficiencies in the old impo&s;itions, and the new deficiencies of every kind which were to be expected, what remained to a State without authority? The National A&s;&s;embly called for a vo|luntary benevolence. What they obtained was &s;ome|thing more than could be rationally calculated, but what was far, indeed, from an&s;werable to their real nece&s;&s;ities, and much le&s;s to their fond expectations. At length the ma&s;k is thrown off, and they are now trying to exact their benevolence by <HI>force.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;poil of the church was now become the grand re&s;ource of all their operations in finance. Money was no where to be &s;een. The Mini&s;ter of Finance reiterated his call for a &s;upply. Thus pre&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, in&s;tead of paying the old debt, they con|tracted a new one, at 3 per cent. creating a new paper currency, called A&s;&s;ignats, founded on an eventual &s;ale of the church lands.</P>
<P>It was found nece&s;&s;ary by all, even the mo&s;t vio|lent means, to put every individual on the &s;ame bottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty intere&s;t. In order, therefore, to force the mo&s;t reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rendered their paper circulation compul&s;ory in all payments. With you a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner with|out a &s;peculation. What he receives in the morning will not have the &s;ame value at night. Indu&s;try mu&s;t wither away. Oeconomy mu&s;t be driven from your country. Careful provi&s;ion will have no exi&s;|tence.
<PB N="17" REF="16">
Who will labour without knowing the amount of his pay? Who will &s;tudy to increa&s;e what none can e&s;timate? Who will accumulate when he does not know the value of what he &s;aves?</P>
<P>The truly melancholy part of thus &s;y&s;tematically making a nation of game&s;ters is this, that <HI>though all are forced to play, few can under&s;tand the game.</HI> And I have no doubt, that if this mon&s;ter of a Con|&s;titution can continue, France will be wholly go|verned by the agitators in corporations, by &s;ocieties in the towns formed of directors of a&s;&s;ignats, and tru&s;tees for the &s;ale of church lands, attornies, agents, money-jobbers, &s;peculators, and adventurers, com|po&s;ing an ignoble con&s;piracy, founded on the de|&s;truction of the Crown, the Church, the Nobility, and the People.</P>
<P>It is not the confi&s;cation of our church property, from this example in France, that I dread, though I think this would be no trifling evil. The great &s;ource of my &s;olicitude is, le&s;t it ever &s;hould be con|&s;idered in England, as the policy of a State, to &s;eek re&s;ource in confi&s;cations <HI>of any kind;</HI> or that any one de&s;cription of citizens &s;hould be brought to regard any of the others as their proper prey. Nations are wading deeper and deeper into an ocean of bound|le&s;s debt. Public debts, which at fir&s;t were a &s;ecu|rity to Governments by intere&s;ting many in the pub|lic tranquillity, are likely, in their exce&s;s, to be|come the means of their &s;ubver&s;ion. If Govern|ments provide for the&s;e debts by heavy impo&s;itions, they peri&s;h by becoming odious to the people: if
<PB N="18" REF="17">
they do not provide for them, they will be undone by the efforts of the mo&s;t dangerous of all parties, I mean an exten&s;ive, di&s;contented <HI>money intere&s;t,</HI> in|jured, but not de&s;troyed.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>The two Parties who have brought about the Re|volution in that Country.</HI></HEAD>
<P>Along with the monied intere&s;t in France, a new de&s;cription of men had grown up, with whom that intere&s;t &s;oon formed a clo&s;e and marked union; I mean the political <HI>Men of Letters.</HI> Men of letters, fond of di&s;tingui&s;hing them&s;elves, are rarely aver&s;e to innovation. This literary cabal had &s;ome years ago formed &s;omething like a regular plan <HI>for the de&s;truction of the Chri&s;tian Religion.</HI> What was not to be done towards their great end, by any di|rect or immediate act, might be wrought by a lon|ger proce&s;s through the medium of opinion. The world had done them ju&s;tice, and in favour of gene|ral talents, forgave the evil tendency of their pecu|liar principles. This was true liberality; which they returned, by endeavouring to confine the reputation of &s;en&s;e, learning, and ta&s;te, to them&s;elves or their followers. To this &s;y&s;tem of literary monopoly was joined an unremitting indu&s;try to blacken and di&s;|credit, in every way, and by every means, all tho&s;e who did not hold to their faction. To tho&s;e who have ob&s;erved the &s;pirit of their conduct, it had been long clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and pen into a per&s;ecution which would &s;trike at property, liberty, and life. The i&s;&s;ue of the whole was, that what
<PB N="19" REF="18">
with oppo&s;ition, and what with &s;ucce&s;s, a violent and malignant zeal of a kind hitherto unknown, took entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their minds. The re&s;ources of intrigue were called in, to &s;upply the defects of argument and wit; and as controver&s;ial zeal &s;oon turns its thoughts on force, they began to in&s;inuate them&s;elves into a corre&s;pondence with foreign princes; in hopes, through their authority, which at fir&s;t they flattered, to bring about the changes they had in view. The corre&s;pondence between this cabal and the late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, will throw no &s;mall light on their proceedings. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e for which they intrigued with princes, they cultivated in a di&s;tingui&s;hed manner the <HI>monied in|tere&s;t</HI> of France.</P>
<P>They who will not believe that the philo&s;ophical fanatics who guide in the&s;e matters entertain a de&s;ign of utterly aboli&s;hing the Chri&s;tian religion, whenever the minds of men are prepared for this la&s;t &s;troke again&s;t it, by bringing its Mini&s;ters into univer&s;al contempt, are utterly ignorant of their character and proceedings. The&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;ts do not &s;cruple to to avow their opinion, that a &s;tate can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without any Religion better than with one; and that they are able to &s;upply the place of any good which may be in it, by a &s;ort of education, the &s;cheme of which has been long known. Of late they di&s;tingui&s;h it by the name of <HI>a Civic Education;</HI> but its tendency is to form a new race of &s;avages in Chri&s;tian countries.</P>

As the&s;e two kinds of men, <HI>(the literary and mo|nied intere&s;t)</HI> appear principal leaders in all the late tran&s;actions, their junction and politics will &s;erve to account for the general fury with which all the land|ed property of eccle&s;ia&s;tical corporations has been attacked, and the great care, which contrary to their principles has been taken of a monied intere&s;t origi|nating from the authority of the Crown.</P>
<P>We cannot be ignorant of the &s;pirit of athei&s;tical fanatici&s;m, in&s;pired by a multitude of writings, di&s;|per&s;ed with incredible a&s;&s;iduity and expence, and by &s;ermons delivered in all the &s;treets and places of pub|lic re&s;ort in Paris. The&s;e writings and &s;ermons have filled the populace with a black and &s;avage atrocity of mind, which &s;uper&s;edes in them the common feel|ing of morality and religion.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of pro&s;elyti&s;m attends this &s;pirit of fana|tici&s;m. They have &s;ocieties to cabal and corre&s;pond at home and abroad for the propagation of their te|nets. The republic of Berne, one of the happie&s;t, the mo&s;t pro&s;perous, and the be&s;t governed coun|tries upon earth, is one of the great objects, at the de&s;truction of which they aim. I am told they have in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ucceeded in &s;owing there the &s;eeds of di&s;content. They are bu&s;y throughout Germany. Spain and Italy have not been untried. <HI>England</HI> is not left out of the comprehen&s;ive &s;cheme of their malignant charity; and in England we find tho&s;e who &s;tretch out their arms to them, who recom|mend their examples from more than one pulpit, and who choo&s;e in more than one periodical meeting, publikly to corre&s;pond with them, to applaud them,

and to hold them up as objects of imitation, who &s;ugge&s;t to them leagues of perpetual amity, <HI>at the very time</HI> when the governing powers of their coun|try may find it expedient <HI>to make war upon them.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, we ought to hold our|&s;elves upon our guard: the beginnings of confu&s;ion with us in England, are at pre&s;ent feeble enough, but whenever our neighbour's hou&s;e is on fire, it cannot be ami&s;s for the engines to play a little on our own.</P>

<HEAD>IV. <HI>The wild notions of their followers in England.</HI></HEAD>
<P>On the forenoon of the 4th of November, 1789, Dr. Richard Price, a non-conforming mini&s;ter of eminence, preached to the above-mentioned Revo|lution Society, at the di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;e in the Old Jewry, a very extraordinary mi&s;cellaneous &s;ermon. That &s;ermon is in a &s;train which, I believe, has not been heard in this kingdom in any of the pulpits which are tolerated and encouraged in it, &s;ince the year 1648, when a predece&s;&s;or of Dr. Price, the Rev. Hugh Peters, made the King's own cha|pel at St. James's ring with the honour and privi|lege of the Saints; who, "with the high prai&s;es of God in their mouths, and a two-edged &s;word in their hands, were to execute judgement on the heathen, and puni&s;hments upon the people; to bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron." Few harangues from the pulpit ever breathed le&s;s of the &s;pirit of moderation, than the lecture in
<PB N="22" REF="21">
the Old Jewry. Suppo&s;ing, however, that &s;omething like moderation were vi&s;ible in this political &s;ermon; yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought to be allowed to the di&s;&s;en&s;ions and animo&s;ities of mankind.</P>
<DIV3 N="1">
<HEAD>1. <HI>Affecting our Civil Con&s;titution.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The doctrines of this political divine affect our Con&s;titution in its vital parts. He a&s;&s;erts that by the principles of the Revolution of 1688, the people of England have acquired three fundamental rights; namely, that we have acquired a right,</P>
<P>1&s;t. To choo&s;e our own Governors;</P>
<P>2d. To ca&s;hier them for mi&s;conduct;</P>
<P>3d. To frame a Government for our&s;elves.</P>
<P>This new and hitherto unheard-of Bill of Rights, though made in the name of the whole people of England, belongs to the&s;e gentlemen, and their faction only. The body of the Engli&s;h nation have no &s;hare in it; they utterly di&s;claim it. They are bound to do &s;o by the laws of their country, made at the time of that very Revolution, which is appealed to by the Society which abu&s;es its name.</P>
<P>If the principles of the Revolution are any where to be found, it is in the Statute called the Declaration of Right. In that mo&s;t wi&s;e, &s;ober, and con&s;iderate declaration, drawn up by great Lawyers and great State&s;men, and not by warm and inexperienced en|thu&s;ia&s;ts, not one word is &s;aid, nor one &s;ugge&s;tion made, of a general right to choo&s;e our own gover|nors.
<PB N="23" REF="22">
At no time, perhaps, did the &s;overeign Legi&s;|lature manife&s;t a more tender regard to that funda|mental principle of Briti&s;h policy, <HI>an hereditary &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion,</HI> than at the time of the Revolution. The Crown was carried &s;omewhat out of the line in which it had before moved; but the new line was derived from the &s;ame &s;tock. It was &s;till a kind of heredi|tary de&s;cent qualified with Prote&s;tanti&s;m. When the Legi&s;lature altered the direction, but kept the principle, they &s;hewed that they held it inviolable. All this precaution proves to a demon&s;tration, how totally adver&s;e the wi&s;dom of the nation was to turn|ing a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity into a rule of law.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;econd</HI> claim of the Revolution Society is, a right of ca&s;hiering our governors for mi&s;conduct. No government could &s;tand a moment if it could be blown down with any thing &s;o loo&s;e and indefinite as an opinion of mi&s;conduct. They who led at the Re|volution grounded the virtual abdication of King James upon no &s;uch light and uncertain principle. They charged him with nothing le&s;s than a de&s;ign to &s;ubvert the Prote&s;tant Church and State. This was &s;omething more than mi&s;conduct. Their tru&s;t for the future pre&s;ervation of the State was not in fu|ture revolutions. The grand policy of all their re|gulations was to render it almo&s;t impracticable for any future Sovereign to compel the States of the kingdom to have again recour&s;e to tho&s;e violent re|medies. In order to lighten the Crown they aggra|vated re&s;pon&s;ibility on mini&s;ters of State: be&s;ides, this ceremony of ca&s;hiering Kings, of which the&s;e
<PB N="24" REF="23">
gentlemen talk &s;o much at their ea&s;e, can rarely, if ever, be performed without force: it then becomes a ca&s;e of war, and not of Con&s;titution. Government mu&s;t be abu&s;ed and deranged indeed, before it can be thought of; then the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t in|dicate the remedy; but with or without right, a Re|volution will be the very la&s;t re&s;ource of the think|ing and the good.</P>
<P>The $Word$ head of right, namely, the Right to form a Government for our&s;elves, has, at lea&s;t, as little counterance from any thing done at the Revo|lution, as the t$o fir&s;t of their claims. The very idea of the fabrication of a new government, is enough to fill us with di&s;gu&s;t and horror. We wi&s;hed at the period of the Revolution, and do now with, to derive all that we po&s;&s;e&s;s as an inheritance from our forefathers; well knowing that, without an hereditary government, we can have no hereditary right to any thing. To the people of England, the idea of inheritance furni&s;hes a &s;ure principle of con|&s;ervation, and a &s;$re principle of tran&s;mi&s;&s;ion, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acqui&s;ition free; but it &s;ecures what it ac|quires. All the reformations we have hitherto made have proceeded on the principle of reference to an|tiquity; and I hope, nay, I am per&s;uaded, that all tho&s;e which po&s;&s;ibly may be formed hereafter, will be carefully formed upon analogical precedent, authority, and example.</P>

<HEAD>2. <HI>The Rights of Men.</HI></HEAD>
<P>But it is in vain to talk to the&s;e gentlemen of authority and example. They have a mine that will blow up at one gr$$d explo&s;ion all precedents, charters, and Acts of Parliament. They have the <HI>"rights of men."</HI> Again&s;t the&s;e, their rights of men, let no government look for &s;ecurity in the length of its continuance, or in the ju&s;tice and lenity of its ad|mini&s;tration. The objections of the&s;e &s;peculati&s;ts, if its forms do not quadrate with their theories, are as valid again&s;t &s;uch an old and beneficial government, as again&s;t the mo&s;t violent tyranny or the greene&s;t u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Far am I from denying in theory; full as far is my heart from withholding in practice, (if I were of power to give or withhold) the <HI>real</HI> rights of men. In denying their fal&s;e claims, I do not mean to injure tho&s;e which are real, and which are &s;uch as their pretended rights would totally de|&s;troy. By having a right to every thing, men want every thing. Government is a contrivance of hu|man wi&s;dom to provide for human wants. Among the&s;e wants is to be reckoned a want, out of civil &s;o|ciety, of a &s;ufficient re&s;traint upon their pa&s;&s;ions. This can only be done by a power out of them&s;elves; and not in the exerci&s;e of its functions, &s;ubject to that will, and tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which it is its office to bridle and &s;ubdue. But as the liberties and re&s;tric|tions vary with times and circum&s;tances, and admit of infinite modifications, they are not to be &s;ettled
<PB N="26" REF="25">
upon any ab&s;tract rule; and it is as fooli&s;h to di&s;cu&s;s them upon that principle, as it would be to di&s;cu&s;s a man's ab&s;tract right to food and to medicine.</P>

<HEAD>3 <HI>The common feelings of humanity.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The wor&s;t of the&s;e politics of revolution is this, they temper and harden the brea&s;t, in order to prepare it for the de&s;perate &s;trokes which are &s;ome|times u&s;ed in extreme occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>This &s;ort of people are &s;o taken up with their theories about the <HI>Rights</HI> of man, that they have to|tally forgot his <HI>nature.</HI> The famous &s;ermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but this &s;pirit through the whole of it. Plots, ma&s;&s;acres, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, &s;eem to &s;ome people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution. The preacher found them all in the French Revolution; his enthu&s;ia&s;m kindles as he advances, and when he arrives at his peroration, he breaks out into the following rapture:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;What an eventful period is this! I am happy that I have lived to &s;ee it. I could almo&s;t &s;ay, <HI>Lord, n$w, l$tte&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation.</HI> I have lived to &s;ee a diffu&s;ion of knowledge, which has under|minded &s;uper&s;tition and error. I have lived to &s;ee thirty millions of people, indignant and re&s;olute, &s;purning at &s;lavery, and demanding liberty with an irre&s;i&s;tible voice; their King led in triumph, and an arbitrary monarch &s;urrendering him&s;elf to his &s;ubjects.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="26">
Before I proceed farther, I have to remark, that Dr. Price &s;eems rather to over value the great acqui|&s;itions of light which he has obtained and diffu&s;ed in this age. The la&s;t century had, though in a different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr. Price. On the trial of the Rev. Hugh Peters for high trea|&s;on, it was depo&s;ed, that when King Charles was brought to London for his trial, the apo&s;tle of liberty in that day conducted the triumph. <HI>"I &s;aw,"</HI> &s;ays the witne&s;s, <HI>his Maje&s;ty in the coach with &s;ix hor&s;es, and Peters riding before the King triumphing.</HI> Dr. Price, when he talks as if he had made a di&s;covery, only follows a precedent; for after the commence|ment of the King's trial, this &s;ame Dr. Peters, con|cluding a long prayer at the Royal Chapel at White|hall, (he had very triumphantly cho&s;en his place) &s;aid, "I have prayed and preached the&s;e twenty|years, and now I may &s;ay, with old Simeon, <HI>Lord, now lette&s;t thou thy &s;ervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have &s;een thy &s;alvation."</HI> Peters had not the fruits of his prayer, for he neither departed &s;o &s;oon as he wi&s;hed, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily hope none of his followers may be in this country) him&s;elf a &s;acrifice to the triumph he led as pontiff.</P>
<P>I find a preacher of the go&s;pel, profaning the beau|tiful and prophetic ejaculation, commonly called, <HI>"nunc dimittis,"</HI> made on the fir&s;t pre&s;entation of our Saviour in the temple, and applying it with unnatu|ral rapture to the mo&s;t horrid, atrocious, and afflicting &s;pectacle, that ever was exhibited to the pity and in|dignation
<PB N="28" REF="27">
of mankind. This <HI>leading in triumph,</HI> (a thing in its be&s;t form humanly and irreligious) which fills our preacher with &s;uch un$allowed tran&s;|ports, mu&s;t &s;hock, I believe, the moral ta&s;te of every well-born mind. Several Engli&s;h were the &s;tupified and indignant &s;pectators of that triumph. It was (unle&s;s we have been &s;trangely deceived) a &s;pectacle more re&s;embling a proce&s;&s;ion of American &s;avages, entering into Onondaga, after &s;ome of their murders, called victories, and leading into hovels hung round with &s;calps, their captives overpowered with the &s;colds and buffets of women as ferocious as them|&s;elves, much more than it re&s;embled the triumphal pomp of a civilized nation.&mdash;If a civilized nation, or any man who had a &s;en&s;e of genero&s;ity, were capa|ble of a per&s;onal triumph over the fallen and afflic|ted.</P>

<HEAD>4. <HI>Our Religious E&s;tabli&s;hment.</HI></HEAD>
<P>At fir&s;t I was at a lo&s;s to account for this fit of unguarded tran&s;port, till I recollected the Io Paean of this memorable triumph; I mean the ani|mating cry which called for <HI>all the bi&s;hops to be hanged on the lamp-po&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>However, the cabals here, who take a &s;ort of &s;hare in your tran&s;actions, are yet but a handful of people. In England, mo&s;t of us conceive that it is <HI>envy and mali$aity,</HI> and not a love of the &s;elf-denial and mor|tification of the ancient church, which makes &s;ome look a&s;kance at the di&s;tinctions, and honours, and re|venues, which, taken from no per&s;on, are &s;et apart
<PB N="29" REF="28">
for learning and virtue. The ears of the people of England are di&s;tingui&s;hing; they hear the&s;e men &s;peak broad. Their tongues betray them. Their language is the cant and gibberi&s;h of hypocri&s;y. The people of England mu&s;t think &s;o, when the&s;e praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive evan|gelic poverty, and which in the &s;pirit, ought always to exi&s;t in them, but in the thing mu&s;t be varied, when manners, when modes of life, when indeed the whole order of human affairs, has undergone a total revolution.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the body of the Engli&s;h nation know, and what is better, feel inwardly, that religion is the ba&s;is of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If our religious tenets &s;hould ever want a farther elucidation, we &s;hall not call on <HI>athei&s;m</HI> to explain them. If our eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hment &s;hould want revi&s;ion, it is not <HI>avar$$e or rapa$iry,</HI> public or private, that we &s;hall employ for the audit, receipt, or application of its con&s;ecrated revenue.</P>
<P>It is from their attachment to a church e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, that the Engli&s;h nation did not think it wi&s;e to entru&s;t that great fundamental intere&s;t to the un&s;teady and precarious contribution of individuals. They go further; they certainly never have &s;uffered, and never will &s;uffer the fixed e&s;tate of the church to be con|verted into <HI>a pen&s;ion,</HI> to depend on the trea&s;ury, and to be delayed, withheld, or perhaps extingui&s;hed, by difficulties which may be pretended for political pur|po&s;es, and are in fact, often brought on by the extra|vagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians. The people of England think they have con&s;titutional
<PB N="30" REF="29">
motives, as well as religious, for not turning their in|dependent clergy into pen&s;ioners of &s;tate. They tremble for their liberty from the influence of a clergy dependent on the crown; they tremble for the pub|lic tranquillity from the di&s;orders of a factious clergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the crown. They, therefore, made their church, like their king and nobility, independent.</P>
<P>On the&s;e ideas, in&s;tead of quarrelling with e&s;ta|bli&s;hments, as &s;ome do, who have made a philo&s;ophy and religion of their ho&s;tility to them, we cleave clo&s;ely to them. <HI>Church and State</HI> are ideas in&s;e|parable in our minds; and &s;carcely is the one men|tioned without mentioning the other. We are re|&s;olved to keep an e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; an e&s;tabli&s;hed monarchy; an e&s;tabli&s;hed ari&s;tocracy; an e&s;tabli&s;hed democracy.</P>
