<P>THE <HI>EDINBURGH SOCIETY</HI>
for the encouragement of arts, &s;ciences, ma|nufactures,
and agriculture propo&s;ed, in the
year 1755, <HI>a gold medal</HI> to <HI>the be&s;t ESSAY</HI>
on <HI>TASTE;</HI> and, not having a&s;&s;igned it that
year, repeated the propo&s;al in 1756. This
determined the author to enter on the following
enquiry into the nature of Ta&s;te; the general
principles of which only he pre&s;ented to the So|ciety,
&s;u&s;pecting that the whole might exceed the
limits which they had fixed, by requiring an
<HI>e&s;&s;ay.</HI> The judges appointed for that &s;ub|ject,
having been plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign the premium
to him, he is encouraged to offer the whole, as
it was at fir&s;t compo&s;ed, to the public.</P>

ESSAY
ON
TASTE.</HEAD>
<P>A FINE ta&s;te is neither wholly the
gift of <HI>nature,</HI> nor wholly the effect
of <HI>art.</HI> It derives its origin from
certain powers natural to the mind; but the&s;e
powers cannot attain their full perfection;
unle&s;s they be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by proper culture.
Ta&s;te con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the improvement of
tho&s;e principles, which are commonly called
<HI>the powers of imagination,</HI> and are con&s;idered
by modern philo&s;ophers as <HI>internal</HI> or <HI>reflex
&s;en&s;es</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hutche&s;on</HI> was the fir&s;t who con&s;idered the powers of imagination as &s;o many &s;en&s;es. In his <HI>Enquiry concerning beauty and virtue,</HI> and his <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> he calls them <HI>internal</HI> &s;en&s;es. In his later works, he terms them <HI>&s;ub&s;equent</HI> and <HI>reflex</HI> &s;en&s;es; <HI>&s;ub&s;equent,</HI> becau&s;e they always &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome previous perception of the objects, about which they are employed; thus a perception of harmony pre&s;uppo&s;es our hearing certain founds, and is totally di&s;tinct from merely hear|ing them, &s;ince many, who enjoy the external &s;en&s;e of hearing in the greate&s;t perfection, have no mu&s;ical ear; <HI>reflex,</HI> be|cau&s;e in order to their exertion, the mind reflects upon and takes notice of &s;ome circum&s;tance or mode of the object that was perceived, be&s;ides tho&s;e qualities, which offered them|&s;elves to its attention at fir&s;t view. Thus the perception of any object does not give us the plea&s;ant &s;entiment of novelty, till we have reflected on this circum&s;tance, that we never perceived it formerly. In the following E&s;&s;ay the terms <HI>internal &s;en&s;e</HI> and <HI>reflex &s;en&s;e</HI> are u&s;ed promi&s;cuou&s;ly.</NOTE>, &s;upplying us with finer and more
delicate perceptions, than any which can be
<PB N="2" REF="7">
properly referred to our external organs.
The&s;e are reducible to the following princi|ples;
the &s;en&s;es of novelty, of &s;ublimity, of
beauty, of imitation, of harmony, of ridi|cule,
and of virtue. With the explication
of the&s;e, we mu&s;t, therefore, begin our en|quiry
into the nature of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> We &s;hall
next endeavour to di&s;cover, how the&s;e &s;en&s;es
co-operate in forming <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> what other pow|ers
of the mind are combined with them in
their exertions, what con&s;titutes that refine|ment
and perfection of them, which we
term <HI>good ta&s;te,</HI> and by what means it is ob|tained.
And la&s;t of all, we &s;hall, by a re|view
of the principles, operation, and &s;ub|jects
of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> determine its genuine rank
among our faculties, its proper province, and
real importance.</P>

<P>THE mind receives plea&s;ure or pain,
not only from the impul&s;e of external
objects, but al&s;o from the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of its
own operations and di&s;po&s;itions. When the&s;e
are produced by external objects, the plea&s;ure
or the pain, which ari&s;es immediately from
the exertions of the mind, is a&s;cribed to tho&s;e
things, which give occa&s;ion to them. We
have a plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation, whenever the mind
is in a lively and elevated temper. It attains
this temper, when it is forced to exert its ac|tivity,
and put forth its &s;trength, in order to
&s;urmount any difficulty: and if its efforts
prove &s;ucce&s;sful, con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the &s;ucce&s;s
in&s;pires new joy. Hence moderate difficul|ty,
&s;uch as exerci&s;es the mind, without fa|tiguing
it, is plea&s;ant, and renders the object
<PB N="4" REF="9">
by which it is produced agreeable. Even
plainne&s;s and per&s;picuity becomes di&s;plea&s;ing
in an Author, when it is carried to exce&s;s,
and leaves no room for exerci&s;ing the read|er's
thought: and though great ob&s;curity
di&s;gu&s;ts us, yet we are highly gratified by de|licacy
of &s;entiment, which always includes
&s;ome degree of it, occa&s;ions a &s;u&s;pen&s;e of
thought, and leaves the full meaning to be
gue&s;&s;ed at, and comprehended only on atten|tion
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Some critics have explained this gratification, either by &s;uppo&s;ing imaginary refinements of reflection, or by principles which are only con&s;equences of the plea&s;ure that attends the moderate exerci&s;e of thought. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

Dial.</BIBL></NOTE>&punc; The exerci&s;e of thought, which mo|derate
<PB N="5" REF="10">
difficulty produces, is a principal &s;ource
of the plea&s;ure we take in &s;tudy and inve&s;ti|gation
of every kind; for though the utility
of many &s;ubjects enhances our &s;atisfaction,
yet the former principle, without any aid from
this, often renders very great labour, not only
&s;upportable, but agreeable. Witne&s;s the de|light,
with which antiquaries be&s;tow indefa|tigable
pains on recovering or illu&s;trating an|cient
fragments, recommended only by their
age, and ob&s;curity, and &s;carce apprehended
to be, on any other account, of great impor|tance.
This is in general the cau&s;e of our
plea&s;ure in all enquiries of mere curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>NOT only the performance of actions, but
al&s;o the conception of mo&s;t objects, to which
we have not been accu&s;tomed, is attended
with difficulty. On this account, when <HI>new</HI>
objects are in them&s;elves indifferent, the ef|forts,
that are nece&s;&s;ary for conceiving them,
exalt and enliven the frame of the mind,
make it receive a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion from them,
and thus render them in &s;ome mea&s;ure agree|able.
When the objects are in them&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="11">
agreeable, the&s;e efforts heighten our &s;atisfac|tion.
A fine country or an agreeable pro|&s;pect
is doubly beautiful to a &s;tranger. It
gives con&s;iderable exerci&s;e to the mind, to
ob&s;erve every part of it, and to conceive the
&s;ituation of the &s;everal objects, which it in|cludes.
A fre&s;h di&s;covery in &s;cience, or a
new performance in the arts gives greater &s;a|tisfaction,
when we become fir&s;t acquainted
with it, than ever after. The fir&s;t time that
we &s;tudy a philo&s;ophical theory, the mind
runs through it with eagerne&s;s, that it may
get a view of all its parts, is con&s;tantly en|gaged
in tracing the connection of the argu|ments,
in examining their force, in conceiv|ing
what objections can be formed again&s;t
them, and is by this means affected with an
agreeable agitation, which cea&s;es, after repeat|ed
peru&s;als have rendered the theory familiar
to us. A poem or a picture is examined,
with a &s;imilar ardour and unremitted exertion
of mind, by a per&s;on who has not &s;een it for|merly.</P>
<P>THOUGH a new object be &s;o &s;imple as to be
conceived without any difficulty, there are
&s;ome &s;ituations, in which it will give exerci&s;e
to the mind, and will, for this rea&s;on, be agree|able.
It is extremely di&s;agreeable, to be &s;unk
<PB N="7" REF="12">
into indolence and languor, without any thing
to awaken our attention, or give play to our
faculties. This &s;tate is almo&s;t unavoidable,
when we are long confined to the contem|plation
of a &s;ingle object, or when the &s;ame
object recurs very often to our view. In this
ca&s;e, it &s;oon becomes &s;o familiar, that the
impre&s;&s;ion, which it makes upon the mind,
is too faint to give it any exerci&s;e. Memory
retains all the parts of the object &s;o di&s;tinctly,
that it outruns &s;en&s;e, and, before we have
&s;urveyed them, informs us, that we are per|fectly
acquainted with them already. We
find our&s;elves cloyed, and immediately turn
from the object with di&s;gu&s;t. Any new ob|ject
will, in this &s;ituation, be agreeable; it
occurs opportunely to occupy the mind, when
it was at a lo&s;s how to employ it&s;elf; it
frees us from the pain of &s;atiety and languor;
it gives an impul&s;e to the mind, and
puts it in motion. This is always plea&s;ant,
but its plea&s;ure is greatly augmented by the
unea&s;ine&s;s from which it has relieved us.
This is a plea&s;ure which mo&s;t men ta&s;te eve|ry
day, by varying their &s;tudies, their bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
or their recreations. When genuine
elegance in furniture or architecture has
been long the fa&s;hion, men &s;ometimes grow
weary of it, and imitate the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> or revive
<PB N="8" REF="13">
the <HI>Gothic</HI> ta&s;te, merely for the plea&s;ure they
receive from what is unlike to tho&s;e things,
which they have been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee.
The plea&s;ure of novelty is, in this ca&s;e, pre|ferred
to that which re&s;ults from real beauty.</P>
<P>IF there are &s;ome things, who&s;e novelty
produces no degree of plea&s;ure, it ari&s;es from
their not at all enlivening the thought, or
exerci&s;ing the mind. If their novelty is even
painful, it proceeds from their exciting &s;ome
other &s;en&s;ation, which de&s;troys the plea&s;ure
naturally attendant on the novelty. The ex|erci&s;e
of mind, which the conception of new
objects occa&s;ions, though it be plea&s;ant in its
own nature, renders a di&s;agreeable object more
di&s;agreeable at fir&s;t: for the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite
&s;en&s;ations produced by the &s;ame cau&s;e, and
exi&s;ting in the mind at once, are ea&s;ily trans|fu&s;ed
into one another, and, by their com|po&s;ition
form one more violent, which al|ways
follows the nature of the ingredient that
was mo&s;t inten&s;e.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the elevation and exertion of
mind, which &s;prings from the mere difficulty
of conceiving a new object, or from the live|line&s;s
of a new perception, is attended with
<PB N="9" REF="14">
&s;urpri&s;e, which augments our delight or un|ea&s;ine&s;s,
by farther enlivening the thought
and agitating the mind. For this rea&s;on, the
poet and the orator, not only &s;olicitou&s;ly
avoid &s;entiments and modes of expre&s;&s;ion
which are trite and common, and &s;earch
through all the &s;tores of nature for images,
figures, and illu&s;trations, which have not
been appropriated by their predece&s;&s;ors; but
al&s;o &s;tudy to contrive the &s;tructure of their
compo&s;itions in &s;uch a manner, that the
commone&s;t thoughts and arguments may &s;ur|pri&s;e
by the unexpectedne&s;s of their intro|duction
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">E&s;t enim grata in eloquendo novitas et commutatio, et magis inopinata delectant. <BIBL><HI>Quint. In&s;t. Orat.</HI> lib. viii. cap. 6.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even the hi&s;torian, who is
confined to known materials and facts, en|deavours
to give them the appearance of no|velty,
by the light in which he repre&s;ents
them, and by his own reflections on the cau|&s;es,
the effects, and the nature of the tran&s;|actions
he narrates. Novelty can be&s;tow
charms on a mon&s;ter, and make things plea|&s;ant,
which have nothing to recommend
them but their rarity.</P>
<P>IN like manner, any agreeable pa&s;&s;ion or
emotion, which a new object happens to
<PB N="10" REF="15">
produce, will run into the plea&s;ant &s;entiment
that naturally ari&s;es from its novelty, and will
augment it. A new &s;uit gives plea&s;ure to a
child, by its being different from his former;
it likewi&s;e excites his pride, and gives him an
expectation of attracting the notice of his
companions. It gratifies the vanity of a fine
lady, to be among the fir&s;t in a fa&s;hion; it
&s;eems to proclaim her rank, to di&s;tingui&s;h
her from the vulgar, and to command
re&s;pect.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ure of novelty is &s;ometimes al&s;o
heightened by reflection. When the con|ception
of an object is attended with very
con&s;iderable difficulty, the plea&s;ure which
we feel in the exertion of mind, nece&s;&s;ary
for overcoming this difficulty, is increa&s;ed by
the joy, with which we reflect on our &s;uc|ce&s;s
in having &s;urmounted it. When objects
are of &s;uch a nature that we reckon our ac|quaintance
with them an acqui&s;ition in know|ledge,
the plea&s;ure of their novelty ari&s;es in
part from the &s;atisfaction, with which we
reflect on our having made this acqui&s;ition.
Both the&s;e circum&s;tances, the conciou&s;ne&s;s
of &s;ucce&s;s, and the opinion of improvement,
contribute to that delight, which a mathema|tician
<PB N="11" REF="16">
enjoys, the fir&s;t time that he compre|hends
a difficult and curious demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>IT may be farther ob&s;erved, that novelty
in the works of genius and art derives addi|tional
charms from another principle, to be
explained afterwards, the ingenuity which it
&s;hews. To &s;trike out a new track, to exe|cute
what was not attempted before, di&s;plays
original genius, which we always ob&s;erve
with plea&s;ure.</P>

But we take in, with ea&s;e, one entire con|ception

it one: the view of any &s;ingle part
&s;ugge&s;ts the whole, and enables fancy to ex|tend

the capacity of the mind.</P>
<P>MANY things are indeed denominated &s;ub|lime,

&s;eem incapable of amplitude, the fir&s;t and fun|damental
requi&s;ite of the &s;ublime. But &s;uch

a whole, partake of the nature of <HI>quan|tity,</HI>
and, as well as exten&s;ion, enlarge and
elevate the mind, which contemplates them.
Eternity is an object, which fills the whole
capacity of the &s;oul, nay exceeds its compre|hen&s;ion;
and &s;trikes it with a&s;toni&s;hment and
admiration. We cannot &s;urvey a va&s;t army

which ari&s;es, not &s;o much from the
largene&s;s of the &s;pace they occupy, as from
the numbers of men or &s;hips, which are in

to a common end; the union and &s;imi|litude
of the parts adding <HI>&s;implicity</HI> to the
<HI>va&s;tne&s;s</HI> of their number. Hence too is de|rived
the &s;ublime of &s;cience, which lies in
univer&s;al principles and general theorems,
from which, as from an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource,
flow multitudes of corollaries and &s;ubordinate
truths.</P>
<P>BUT do not we attribute grandeur and
&s;ublimity to &s;ome things, which are de&s;titute
of <HI>quantity</HI> of every kind? What can be more
remote from quantity, than the pa&s;&s;ions and
affections of the &s;oul? Yet the mo&s;t imperfect
and uncultivated ta&s;te is &s;en&s;ible of a &s;ubli|mity
in heroi&s;m, in magnanimity, in a con|tempt
of honours, of riches, of power, in a
noble &s;uperiority to things external, in pa|trioti&s;m,
in univer&s;al benevolence. To ac|count
for this, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that, as
no pa&s;&s;ion can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without its cau&s;es, its
objects, and its effects, &s;o, in forming the
idea of any pa&s;&s;ion, we do not &s;atisfy our|&s;elves
<PB N="18" REF="22">
with conceiving it as a &s;imple emotion
in the mind, but we run over, in thought,
the objects about which it is employed, the
things by which it is produced, and the ef|fects
by which it di&s;covers it&s;elf. And as
the&s;e always enter into our conception of the
pa&s;&s;ion, and are often connected with quan|tity,
they naturally render the pa&s;&s;ion &s;ub|lime.
What wonder that we e&s;teem hero|i&s;m
grand, when, in order to imagine it, we
&s;uppo&s;e a mighty conqueror, in oppo&s;ition
to the mo&s;t formidable dangers, acquiring
power over <HI>multitudes</HI> of nations, &s;ubjecting
to his dominion wide <HI>extended</HI> countries, and
purcha&s;ing renown, which reaches to the
extremities of the world, and &s;hall continue
through <HI>all the ages</HI> of futurity? What can
be more truly great than the object of that
benevolence, which, uncon&s;ined by the nar|row
limits of vicinity or relation, compre|hends
<HI>multitudes,</HI> gra&s;ps whole <HI>large</HI> &s;ocie|ties,
and even extends from pole to pole?</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t al&s;o be remarked, that whatever
excites in the mind a &s;en&s;ation or emotion
&s;imilar to what is excited by va&s;t objects is
on this account denominated &s;ublime; it be|ing
natural to reduce to the &s;ame &s;pecies, to
<PB N="19" REF="23">
expre&s;s by the &s;ame name, and even fre|quently
to confound together tho&s;e objects,
which we contemplate with the &s;ame or a
like di&s;po&s;ition. Hence the raging of the
&s;ea in a &s;torm, and the loud roaring thunder&punc;
which in&s;pire an awful &s;edatene&s;s, are termed
&s;ublime. Objects exciting terror are, for
this rea&s;on, in general &s;ublime; for terror
always implies a&s;toni&s;hment, occupies the
whole &s;oul, and &s;u&s;pends all its motions.</P>
<P>IN like manner, we admire as &s;ublime &s;u|perior
excellence of many kinds; &s;uch emi|nence
in &s;trength, or power, or genius, as
is uncommon, and overcomes difficulties,
which are in&s;urmountable by lower degrees
of ability; &s;uch vigour of mind, as indicates
the ab&s;ence of low and groveling pa&s;&s;ions, and
enables a per&s;on to de&s;pi&s;e honours, riches,
power, pain, death; &s;etting him above
tho&s;e enjoyments, on which men generally
put an high value, and tho&s;e &s;ufferings,
which they think intolerable. Such degrees
of excellence excite wonder and a&s;toni&s;hment,
the &s;ame emotion which is produced by am|plitude.
A great degree of <HI>quality</HI> has here
the &s;ame effect upon the mind, as va&s;tne&s;s of
<HI>quantity,</HI> and that by the &s;ame principles, by
<PB N="20" REF="24">
&s;tretching and elevating the mind in the con|ception
of it.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall but ju&s;t ob&s;erve that the &s;ublime
pa&s;&s;ions, habitually prevailing in the temper,
and uniformly di&s;playing them&s;elves in &s;uita|ble
expre&s;&s;ions and effects, con&s;titute dignity
and &s;ublimity of character.</P>
<P>BUT in order to comprehend the whole
extent of the &s;ublime, it is proper to take no|tice
that objects, which do not them&s;elves
po&s;&s;e&s;s that quality, may neverthele&s;s acquire
it, by <HI>a&s;&s;ociation</HI> with &s;uch as do. It is the
nature of a&s;&s;ociation to unite different ideas
&s;o clo&s;ely, that they become in a manner
one. In that &s;ituation, the qualities of one
part are naturally attributed to the whole, or
to the other part. At lea&s;t a&s;&s;ociation ren|ders
the tran&s;ition of the mind from one idea
to another &s;o quick and ea&s;y, that we con|template
both with the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, and
are therefore &s;imilarly affected by both.
Whenever, then, any object uniformly and
con&s;tantly introduces into the mind the idea
of another that is grand, it will, by its con|nexion
with the latter, be it&s;elf rendered
grand. Hence words and phra&s;es are deno|minated
<PB N="21" REF="25">
lofty and maje&s;tic. Sublimity of
&s;tyle ari&s;es, not &s;o much from the &s;ound of
the words, though that doubtle&s;s may have
&s;ome influence, as from the nature of the
ideas, which we are accu&s;tomed to annex to
them, and the character of the per&s;ons,
among whom they are in mo&s;t common u&s;e.
This too is the origin of the grandeur we a&s;|cribe
to objects high and elevated in place;
of the veneration, with which we regard
things in any direction di&s;tant; and of the
&s;uperior admiration excited by things remote
in time; e&s;pecially in antiquity or pa&s;t du|ration<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">The author of <HI>a Treati&s;e of Human Nature</HI> has very in|geniou&s;ly reduced the&s;e phaenomena into the principle of a&s;&s;o|ciation. B. ii. P. 3, S. 8. The &s;um of his rea&s;oning, &s;o far as it is nece&s;&s;ary to take notice of it here, is as follows. &ldquo;Be|cau&s;e we are accu&s;tomed every moment to ob&s;erve the difficulty with which things are rai&s;ed in oppo&s;ition to the impul&s;e of gravity; the idea of a&s;cending always implies the notion of force exerted in overcoming this difficulty; the conception of which invigorates and elevates the thought, after the &s;ame manner as a va&s;t object, and thus gives a di&s;tance above us much more an appearance of greatne&s;s, than the &s;ame &s;pace could have in any other direction. The &s;en&s;ation of ampli|tude, which by this means comes to attend the interpo&s;ed di&s;tance, is transferred to, and con&s;idered as excited by the ob|ject that is eminent and above us; and that object, by this transference, acquires grandeur and &s;ublimity. And here we may ob&s;erve in pa&s;&s;ing, that this natural tendency to a&s;&s;ociate ideas of grandeur with things above us is the rea&s;on, why the term <HI>&s;ublime</HI> $s metaphorically applied to excellence of any kind, e&s;pecially to that &s;pecies of it, which elates the mind with noble pride in the conception. To our transferring, in like manner, the interpo&s;ed &s;pace, and its attendant &s;en&s;ation, to the di&s;tant object, is owing the veneration, with which we regard, and the value we &s;et upon things remote in place. And becau&s;e we find greater difficulty, and mu&s;t employ &s;u|perior energy, in running over the parts of duration, than tho&s;e of &s;pace; and in a&s;cending through pa&s;t duration, than in de&s;cending through what is future; therefore we value higher, and contemplate with greater veneration things di&s;tant in time than things remote in &s;pace, and the per&s;ons and objects of antiquity, than tho&s;e which we figure to our&s;elves in the ages of futurity.&rdquo;</NOTE>.</P>

BUT the fine arts pre&s;ent the mo&s;t nume|rous

In all of them, the &s;ublime is at|tained,
chiefly by the arti&s;t's exciting <HI>ideas</HI> of
&s;ublime objects; and in &s;uch as are mimical,
this quality is chiefly owing to our being led
by the exactne&s;s of the imitation to form
ideas and conceive images of &s;ublime originals.

and belongs to objects po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>uniformity,
variety,</HI> and <HI>proportion.</HI> Each of the&s;e qua|lities
plea&s;es in &s;ome degree; but all of them
united give exqui&s;ite &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>FACILITY in the conception of an object,
if it is moderate, gives us plea&s;ure: the mind
thinks well of it&s;elf, when it is able to form
it's conception without pain or labour. This
con&s;titutes the value of per&s;picuity of thought
and language, which is agreeable in oppo&s;i|tion
to ob&s;curity, as this occa&s;ions an unea&s;y
&s;earch into the meaning of the parts or the
tendency of the whole, which requires greater
labour than we are willing to be&s;tow. Hence
too it is that <HI>uniformity</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity</HI> become
agreeable. Objects endued with the&s;e qua|lities
<PB N="32" REF="36">
enter ea&s;ily into the mind: they do
not di&s;tract our attention, or hurry us too
fa&s;t from one &s;cene to another: the view of
a part &s;ugge&s;ts the whole, and, impelling the
mind to imagine the re&s;t, produces a grateful
exertion of its energy.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, in all the beautiful works
of nature, uniformity is pre&s;erved in the ge|neral
appearance of the corre&s;pondent parts.
And though a perfectly accurate regularity is
avoided, both in natural effects and in the
fine arts; yet &s;o much of it mu&s;t be retained,
as to keep the variety from degenerating into
perplexity and confu&s;ion. Regular figures
are in general preferred to irregular; and
&s;uch as have parallel &s;ides to &s;uch as have
not. Equality is requi&s;ite to the beauty of
every piece of painting<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><L>Altera pars tabulae vacuo ne frigida campo,</L>

notwith&s;tanding, according to the rules of
per&s;pective, &s;ugge&s;t the <HI>idea</HI> of exact uni|formity.
To be&s;tow &s;implicity upon a mul|titude
of &s;eparate phaenomena, the philo&s;o|pher
traces them up to common qualities,
and general cau&s;es; and it is only when he
has done &s;o, that the beauty of &s;cience be|gins<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Uniformity and &s;implicity are, &s;trictly &s;peaking, di&s;tinct ideas; the former implying the &s;imilarity of the corre&s;pondent parts; the latter the fewne&s;s of unlike parts in the whole ob|ject.

<P>BUT uniformity, when perfect and un|mixed,
is apt to pall upon the &s;en&s;e, to grow
languid, and to &s;ink the mind into an unea&s;y
&s;tate of indolence. It cannot therefore alone
produce plea&s;ure, either very high, or of very
long duration. <HI>Variety</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to enli|ven
it. Where this is wanting, uniformity
degenerates into dull formality. Variety in
&s;ome mea&s;ure gratifies the &s;en&s;e of novelty,
as our ideas vary in pa&s;&s;ing from the contem|plation
of one part to that of another. This
<PB N="34" REF="38">
tran&s;ition puts the mind in action, and gives
it employment, the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of which is
agreeable<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Intricacy,</HI> which often greatly contributes to beauty, may be con&s;idered as a &s;pecies of <HI>variety;</HI> at lea&s;t its agreea|blene&s;s is derived from the &s;ame cau&s;e; and variety is mo&s;t naturally combined with uniformity, intricacy with &s;implici|ty.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the works of nature we find variety
&s;tudiou&s;ly &s;ought after, as in the uneven &s;ur|face
of the globe; the infinity of &s;hapes and
hues in the flowers that adorn it; the intri|cate
windings of rivers; the wildne&s;&s;es of na|ture,
which we even &s;et our&s;elves to copy by
art; and in ten thou&s;and other in&s;tances.
To procure it, the Architect enriches his
buildings with ornaments of different forms.
In all works of ta&s;te, too great uniformity is
avoided by numberle&s;s graceful attitudes, by
varying of members, and by contra&s;ting the
parts<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><L>Inque Figura$um cumulis non omnibus idem</L>

<P>So great is the power of variety in producing beauty, that an|ingenious arti&s;t, who has lately <HI>analy&s;ed</HI> it, not altogether with|out rea&s;on, re&s;olves almo&s;t the whole of it into that principle and defines the art of compo&s;ing to be nothing el&s;e but &startq;the art of varying well.&endq; He holds uniformity no further ne|ce&s;&s;ary, than it is requi&s;ite to convey the idea of re&s;t or motion, without po&s;&s;ibility of falling. But here he goes too far. It were ea&s;y to point out in&s;tances, where uniformity is &s;tudied, though it cannot have any degree of this effect: and he ac|knowleges that beauty re&s;ides only in a <HI>compo&s;ed</HI> variety; which nece&s;&s;arily implies a mixture of uniformity. He indeed &s;uf|ficiently proves that uniformity is not the only, or chief princi|ple of perfect beauty. Yet it often by it&s;elf con&s;titutes &s;ome degree of it; as in the &s;traight and parallel &s;ides of a canal.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="39">
WERE the variety indeed boundle&s;s, the
mind would be fatigued and pained with con|tinual
&s;hifting from part to part, without the
pro&s;pect of any end of its labour: it would
be di&s;plea&s;ed and di&s;gu&s;ted, when it found
that, after numberle&s;s efforts to conceive
the object, the endle&s;s di&s;&s;imilitude and per|plexed
compo&s;ition of the parts &s;till baffled
its endeavours, and hindered it from perfect|ing
its idea. A certain degree of uniformity
mu&s;t therefore be blended with the variety of
objects; otherways this variety, in&s;tead of
producing moderate energy, would &s;ubject us
to in&s;urmountable toil, which would make
our plea&s;ure &s;oon degenerate into pain.</P>
<P>THESE two qualities, by thus moderating
the effects of one another, increa&s;e the plea|&s;ure
<PB N="36" REF="40">
re&s;ulting from each: giving the mind at
once the oppo&s;ite gratifications of facility and
active exertion, mixed with, and mellowing
one another.</P>
<P>PROPORTION con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in re|lations
of the parts preci&s;ely men&s;urable, as
in a general aptitude of the &s;tructure to the
end propo&s;ed; which experience enables us
in&s;tantaneou&s;ly to perceive, better than any
artificial methods can determine it. Its in|fluence
on beauty is therefore derived from
<HI>fitne&s;s</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See HOGARTH'S <HI>Analy&s;is of Beauty,</HI> Chap. xi.</NOTE>, a principle which will be illu&s;tra|ted
pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>A VERY &s;mall di&s;proportion in any of the
members of the human body produces de|formity.
The lea&s;t deviation, in the pro|ductions
of the fine arts, from the natural
harmony of the parts, always occa&s;ions a ble|mi&s;h.</P>
<P>THERE is another kind of <HI>proportion,</HI> at
lea&s;t not wholly dependent on utility, which
is pre&s;erved in the appearances of things,
when none of the parts are &s;o &s;mall, in re&s;pect
of one another, and of the whole, as to di&s;|appear
<PB N="37" REF="41">
through their &s;mallne&s;s, when we
contemplate the whole; and when none of
them are &s;o large, that, when we fix our
view on them, we cannot di&s;tinctly perceive
at the &s;ame time their relation to the whole,
and to the other parts. Figures, who&s;e &s;ides
are very numerous, lo&s;e a great part of the
beauty, which would ari&s;e from this variety,
by the want of proportion between the &s;ides
and the diameter. Works in the <HI>Gothic</HI>
ta&s;te, crowded with minute ornaments, fall as
much &s;hort of perfect beauty, by their di&s;|proportion,
as by their deviation from &s;im|plicity.</P>
<P>As nothing gives us greater plea&s;ure, than
what leads us to form a lofty conception of
our own faculties, &s;o nothing is more di&s;a|greeable,
than what reminds us of their im|perfection.
On this account it is, that the
want of this kind of proportion di&s;gu&s;ts us.
It leads us to entertain a low, and of con&s;equence
ungrateful, opinion of our capacity,
by rendering it impo&s;&s;ible to form one entire
conception of the object. The variety of its
parts may amu&s;e us, and keep us from at|tempting
to comprehend the whole; and
then, e&s;pecially if it be joined with uniform|ity,
<PB N="38" REF="42">
it will yield us &s;ome degree of plea&s;ure,
and con&s;titute an inferior and imperfect &s;pe|cies
of beauty. But &s;till proportion is nece&s;|&s;ary
for perfecting the beauty, and fully gra|tifying
a correct and improved ta&s;te.</P>
<P>THUS the ab&s;ence of any one of the&s;e in|gredients,
the want either of uniformity, of
variety, or of proportion, dimini&s;hes the beau|ty
of objects: but where all of them are
wanting, deformity mu&s;t prevail. Figures
may be de&s;irable or valuable on other ac|counts;
but without the&s;e qualities they can|not
be beautiful.</P>
<P>UTILITY, or the <HI>fitne&s;s</HI> of things for an|&s;wering
their ends<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">This, which is the principle of a di&s;tinct order of beau|ty, is confounded with uniformity, which is but one ingredient in that of figures, by CROUSAZ; <HI>Trait&eacute; du Beau,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>, con&s;titutes another
&s;pecies of beauty, di&s;tinct from that of figure.
It is of &s;o great importance that, though <HI>con|venience</HI>
is &s;ometimes in le&s;&s;er in&s;tances &s;acri|ficed
to <HI>regularity,</HI> yet a great degree of in|convenience
generally de&s;troys all the plea|&s;ure,
which &s;hould have ari&s;en from the &s;ym|metry
and proportion of the parts. It is the
peculiar excellence of nature's works, that, at
<PB N="39" REF="43">
lea&s;t in the noble&s;t of them, the mo&s;t perfect
fitne&s;s for their re&s;pective ends is united and
rendered con&s;i&s;tent with the great elegance of
form<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">In pleri&s;que rebus incredibiliter hoc natura e&s;t ip&s;a fa|bricata,&mdash;ut ea, quae maximam utilitatem in &s;e continerent, eadem haberent plurimum vel dignitatis, vel &s;aepe etiam ve|nu&s;tatis. <BIBL>CIC. <HI>de Orat.</HI> lib. iii.</BIBL></NOTE>. We pay a very great regard to
fitne&s;s and utility, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the &s;tandard
of beauty and proportion in the &s;everal kinds.
And though the mo&s;t perfect art falls infinite|ly
&s;hort of nature, in combining the u&s;eful
with the regular; yet none of its productions
is reckoned a ma&s;ter-piece, in which the&s;e
excellencies do not meet<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">CIC. ibid.</NOTE>; and to obtain
utility, forms of inferior beauty are, for par|ticular
purpo&s;es, con&s;tantly preferred, even
where beauty is far from being neglected.
The cube, not any of the more varied poly|gons,
is cho&s;en for a pede&s;tal, on account of
its &s;tability. Utility has determined, though
with con&s;iderable latitude, the dimen&s;ions and
general form of mo&s;t in&s;truments and works,
without adhering to which, the greate&s;t pro|fu&s;ion
of decoration cannot render them beau|tiful
in the kind. Unfitne&s;s renders orna|ments
di&s;plea&s;ing when wrong applied, which,
in their proper place, might be truly elegant.
<PB N="40" REF="44">
The &s;plendor of a &s;ingle figure in hi&s;tory-painting
will but augment its faultine&s;s, if it
takes off the eye from what ought to be the
principal, and ob&s;tructs the effect which
&s;hould be produced by the whole. In com|po&s;ition
the mo&s;t refined reflections, the mo&s;t
elaborate de&s;criptions, the warme&s;t pathos
di&s;plea&s;e; if they break the unity, if they do
not promote, much more if they retard, the
main de&s;ign, to which all the parts &s;hould be
&s;ubordinate.</P>
<Q>Sed nunc non erat his locus&mdash;</Q>
<P>The impropriety of their po&s;ition wholly
defaces their intrin&s;ic beauty. In general,
it is from the end and de&s;ign of works of ge|nius
that their peculiar rules can be deduced:
this directs the author in the choice, di&s;po|&s;ition,
and embelli&s;hment of the parts: and by
this the critic mu&s;t regulate his judgment.
It is from the relation they bear to different
ends, that narration, poetry, and eloquence
are &s;ubject to very different laws: and from
the &s;ame &s;ource is derived the diver&s;ity of the
rules belonging to the &s;ubordinate branches of
each. Could fitne&s;s be di&s;pen&s;ed with, a col|lection
of fine &s;entiments and figures cloathed
<PB N="41" REF="45">
in agreeable language, might fully gratify
our ta&s;te, however unconnected with one
another.</P>
<P>THAT we may comprehend the nature of
that plea&s;ure which is produced by fitne&s;s, it
mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that, whenever we di&s;cover
in effects a greater degree of uniformity or
well adapted complication, than could be ex|pected
from the laws of chance; e&s;pecially
when we recognize a fitne&s;s for an&s;wering an
important end; we then infer, not only in|tention,
but art and &s;kill in the cau&s;e: which
implying mental excellence and perfection,
the view of it gives a noble &s;atisfaction; as
on the other hand faultine&s;s of contrivance,
by &s;ugge&s;ting imperfect &s;kill and want of ge|nius,
di&s;plea&s;es us greatly. When therefore
we &s;ee a work, it leads us by a natural a&s;&s;o|ciation
to conceive its end; prone to com|pari&s;on,
we examine the propriety of the
parts in relation to this end; if any of them
are prejudicial to it, we are di&s;gu&s;ted with
the want of &s;kill, which this imperfection be|trays.
We dwell in imagination on the in|conveniences
which mu&s;t ari&s;e from the un|fitne&s;s
of the &s;tructure; we form &s;trong ideas
of them, which produce almo&s;t the &s;ame un|ea&s;y
<PB N="42" REF="46">
&s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions, as if we actually
experienced them; and by this means often
obliterate all the plea&s;ing impre&s;&s;ions, which
the other qualities of the object might have
cau&s;ed. But when, on examination, the fit|ne&s;s
of all the parts appears, the &s;atisfaction,
with which we think on the &s;kill and inge|nuity
thus di&s;played, communicates it&s;elf to
the effect &s;o nearly allied to it, &s;o clo&s;ely con|nected
with it by cau&s;ation: and we &s;ympa|thetically
enter into a &s;trong feeling of the de|light
which mu&s;t attend the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or u&s;e
of what is &s;o well de&s;igned and executed.</P>
<P>THE beauty of <HI>colours</HI> is entirely di&s;tinct
from both the former, and plea&s;es us from
principles wholly different. Colours being
nothing el&s;e than various degrees and modi|fications
of light, &s;ome of them are le&s;s hurt|ful
to the organs of &s;ight than others; and
are, on that account, in &s;ome in&s;tances ap|proved
as beautiful.</P>
<P>SOME colours again, by their <HI>&s;plendor,</HI> af|ford
a lively and vigorous &s;en&s;ation, which
gratifies us, by producing a chearful and vi|vacious
di&s;po&s;ition of mind in contemplating
them.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="47">
BUT the beauty of colours is, in mo&s;t in|&s;tances,
re&s;olvable into <HI>a&s;&s;ociation;</HI> tho&s;e being
approved, which, either by a natural re&s;em|blance,
or by cu&s;tom, or opinion, introduce and
are connected with agreeable ideas of any &s;ort;
and tho&s;e being di&s;approved, which have any
way become related to di&s;agreeable ones. The
verdure of the fields is delightful, not only by
being inoffen&s;ive to the eye, but chiefly by
its &s;ugge&s;ting the plea&s;ant idea of fertility.
Heath in bloom would form a carpet agree|able
enough to &s;ight, if we could &s;eparate
from its appearance the idea of the barren|ne&s;s
of the mountains and wilds it covers. In
dre&s;s colours are either beautiful or the con|trary,
according to the nature of the idea
which they lead us to form of the &s;tation, &s;en|timents,
and character of the wearer.</P>
<P>IN &s;ome ca&s;es, a particular dre&s;s, in con|&s;equence
of e&s;tabli&s;hed manners, &s;ugge&s;ts to
the generality nearly the &s;ame idea. Where|ever
this <HI>general</HI> connection takes place, it
forms a kind of &s;tandard in dre&s;s, for per&s;ons
in certain &s;tations or profe&s;&s;ions. We come to
perceive a propriety in conforming to it; and
<PB N="44" REF="48">
we are di&s;plea&s;ed with the indecency of devi|ating
remarkably from it.</P>
<P>WHEN the idea &s;ugge&s;ted by dre&s;s is dif|ferent
in different per&s;ons, &s;o al&s;o is the reli&s;h
for the colour; what &s;ugge&s;ts to one a live|line&s;s
and vivacity of turn, gives another the
idea of gaudine&s;s and levity; the &s;ame dre&s;s
may convey to &s;ome the idea of gravity and
&s;edatene&s;s, to others that of dullne&s;s and au|&s;terity.</P>
<P>COLOURS, as applied in painting, come un|der
con&s;ideration here only in re&s;pect of their
delicacy or vivacity; which, however e&s;ti|mable,
are not yet of &s;o great importance, as
the power they have of repre&s;enting grandeur
or beauty of figure, or of exhibiting &s;olid bo|dies,
by &s;uch an artful and ingenious imita|tion,
as it&s;elf delights us, in a way hereafter
to be explained.</P>
<P>THE beauty of colours may be heightened
by the addition of <HI>variety,</HI> a circum&s;tance
which be&s;tows &s;ome charms on the mo&s;t ir|regular
mixture of them, provided they be of
them&s;elves agreeable, e&s;pecially if they be &s;o
<PB N="45" REF="49">
di&s;po&s;ed as to &s;et off to advantage the &s;eparate
brightne&s;s or beauty of each other.</P>
<P>THERE is perhaps no term u&s;ed in a loo&s;er
&s;en&s;e than beauty, which is applied to almo&s;t
every thing that plea&s;es us. Though this
u&s;age is doubtle&s;s too indefinite, we may,
without a faulty deviation from preci&s;ion, ap|ply
this epithet to every plea&s;ure which is
conveyed by the eye, and which has not got
a proper and peculiar name; to the plea&s;ure
we receive, either when an object of &s;ight
&s;ugge&s;ts plea&s;ant ideas of other &s;en&s;es; or when
the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted are agreeable ones form|ed
from the &s;en&s;ations of &s;ight; or when
both the&s;e circum&s;tances concur. In all
the&s;e ca&s;es, beauty is, at lea&s;t in part, re&s;olva|ble
into a&s;&s;ociation.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t method of effecting beauty, we
have already &s;een exemplified in colours,
which are them&s;elves objects of &s;ight introdu|cing
plea&s;ant ideas not derived from &s;ight.
Thus al&s;o the &s;tructure of a human face often
indicates good mental di&s;po&s;itions, which are
not only them&s;elves approved as virtuous, but
by being &s;o, diffu&s;e a beauty over the coun|tenance
in which they are imprinted: but
<PB N="46" REF="50">
bad affections, expre&s;&s;ed in the look, throw
deformity upon the fine&s;t features.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd way is produced the only
beauty of thought or &s;entiment, which comes
properly under the pre&s;ent head; that beauty
which ari&s;es, when the &s;ubject de&s;cribed is
agreeable to &s;ight, as light, flowers, fields,
meadows, groves; or when it is illu&s;trated by
images from things that are &s;o agreeable.
This is one great part of the beauty of pa&s;to|ral;
and enters in &s;ome degree into every
kind of poetry<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">The other qualities which render &s;entiments beautiful or agreeable, as metaphor, fable, antithe&s;is morality, eleva|tion, &amp;c. belong to other cla&s;&s;es.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO the third cau&s;e, or the union of both
the former, imitations of <HI>beautiful</HI> originals,
by figure and colour, owe their beauty. It
is ob&s;ervable that the arts which u&s;e the&s;e in|&s;truments
have greater advantages for imitat|ing
beauty than &s;ublimity. This they can
repre&s;ent, as we have &s;een, only by &s;ugge&s;ting
<HI>ideas</HI> of grand objects; but the copies would
not, if con&s;idered as originals, be grand;
&s;ince they are almo&s;t ever de&s;titute of magni|tude,
its mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential requi&s;ite, But imita|tions
<PB N="47" REF="51">
of beautiful originals, independent of
their re&s;emblance to the&s;e, are beautiful;
&s;ince they cannot otherways exhibit their
beauties to the thought, than by them&s;elves
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them in &s;ome degree: and often
they po&s;&s;e&s;s them as perfectly as their arche|types.
A &s;tatue has the &s;ame regularity and
proportion as its original. A painting may
equal the object it repre&s;ents, not only in
&s;ymmetry and propriety, but in colour.</P>
<P>THE cla&s;&s;es of beauty, which we have
been explaining, are di&s;tinct in their princi|ples,
though by rea&s;on of the &s;imilitude of
their feeling, they are reduced to the &s;ame
genus. But they are often in things variou&s;ly
united, and by their union they render our
&s;atisfaction more inten&s;e. In a fine face all
the principles of beauty are combined. To
an exact &s;ymmetry and regular proportion of
varied features, and parts nicely adapted to
their &s;everal purpo&s;es, is &s;uperadded complex|ion,
compo&s;ed of white and red, colours beau|tiful

We have a natural &s;en&s;e, which is highly
gratified by a de&s;igned re&s;emblance, though
there be nothing agreeable in the original.
Similitude is a very powerful principle of a&s;&s;o|ciation,
which, by continually connecting
the ideas in which it is found, and leading
our thoughts from one of them to the other,
produces in mankind a &s;trong tendency to
compari&s;on. As compari&s;on implies in the
very act a gentle exertion of the mind, it is
on that account agreeable. As a farther ener|gy
is requi&s;ite for di&s;covering the original by

is intended, our admiration of the &s;kill
and ingenuity of the arti&s;t diffu&s;es it&s;elf over
the effect from which that &s;kill is inferred,
and compleats the delight which the work
in&s;pires.</P>
<P>HENCE the rapture with which a connoi&s;&s;eur
beholds the capital performances of the emi|nent
ma&s;ters in painting or &s;culpture. Hence
the main excellence of poetical or eloquent
de&s;criptions; the characteri&s;tical perfection
of which ari&s;es from the author's judiciou&s;ly
&s;electing the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and &s;triking qua|lities
of his &s;ubject, and combining them in|to
&s;uch a picture as quickly revives in the
reader, and &s;trongly impre&s;&s;es on his mind
a lively idea of the original. The fundamen|talbeauty
of metaphor and allegory lies in their
in&s;inuating the analogies of things; that of &s;imi|litude
and compari&s;on in their more explicitly
propo&s;ing the&s;e analogies. By this they com|municate
<PB N="51" REF="55">
finene&s;s to a &s;entiment. Mo&s;t of
the figures and tropes of eloquence derive
their grace from their being &s;o employed, as
to corre&s;pond with the natural expre&s;&s;ions or
objects of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and &s;entiments, which
actuate the orator, or which he would in&s;pire
into his audience. Improbability, which is
a want of re&s;emblance to natural things, al|ways
renders a fable or &s;tory le&s;s entertaining;
and if the improbability be very great, or ex|tend
to the material parts, it often makes it
wholly nau&s;eous.</P>
<P>WHEN excellent originals are imitated, the
copies derive their charms, not merely from
exactne&s;s of imitation, but al&s;o from the ex|cellence
which they repre&s;ent; and the grati|fication
which the&s;e copies afford may almo&s;t
as properly be a&s;cribed to beauty or &s;ublimity
as to imitation. As the beauty here is com|plicated
in it's principles, it will of con&s;equence
be al&s;o compounded in its effect, and will ra|vi&s;h
the mind much more than either of its con|&s;tituents
alone. An <HI>Hercules,</HI> exhibiting pro|portion,
&s;trength, and fortitude in perfection,
mu&s;t be a finer&s;tatue than the exacte&s;t imitation
of a <HI>Ther&s;ites or Silenus.</HI> The works of <HI>Polygno|tus,</HI>
which repre&s;ented beautiful objects, were
<PB N="52" REF="56">
doubtle&s;s more delightful than the pictures of
<HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> or <HI>Pau&s;on,</HI> however &s;killfully they
might repre&s;ent ordinary or faulty objects<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>.
The ancient <HI>Greek,</HI> or the modern <HI>Italian</HI>
painters will always be preferable to the <HI>Fle|mi&s;h,</HI>
who, though they imitate <HI>well,</HI> do not
make a judicious <HI>choice</HI> of &s;uch beauties of na|ture
as de&s;erve to be imitated<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In this particular the antient arti&s;ts were &s;o careful, that they were not content with imitating the mo&s;t perfect <HI>individuals,</HI> they could meet with; but, collecting the perfec|tions of many, they formed one <HI>general</HI> idea more complete, than could be drawn from any &s;ingle real exi&s;tence. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. The <HI>Margites</HI>
of <HI>Homer</HI> could not have given us &s;o high en|tertainment
as we receive from the <HI>Iliad.</HI> A
compari&s;on, however nicely &s;uited to the &s;ubject,
will plea&s;e &s;till more, if it is taken from what
conveys no ideas, but &s;uch as are noble and
agreeable: and indeed by &s;ugge&s;ting &s;uch as
are &s;trongly the rever&s;e, it will be &s;uffi|cient
<PB N="53" REF="57">
to turn the mo&s;t magnificent &s;ubject
into ridicule.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till the force of imitation is mo&s;t
con&s;picuous, when no other principles con|cur
to heighten its effect: for as it is then
pure and unmixed, we cannot que&s;tion,
that the whole plea&s;ure of the &s;entiment pro|duced
is owing to it alone. Its power is in|deed
&s;o great, that it not only, without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of other principles, produces a con|&s;iderable
degree of plea&s;ure; but often re|commends
and gains the preference to
imperfect or faulty originals; and makes
things grateful when reflected by it, which
would be very ungrateful, if viewed directly.
The rude&s;t rocks and mountains; the ob|jects
that in nature are mo&s;t deformed; even
di&s;ea&s;e and pain, acquire beauty when &s;kill|fully
imitated in painting<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. It is chiefly
by copying imperfections and ab&s;urdities that
mimicry and humour plea&s;e. A perfect
imitation of characters morally evil, can make
us dwell with plea&s;ure on them, notwith&s;tand|ing
the unea&s;y &s;entiments of di&s;approbation
<PB N="54" REF="58">
and abhorrence which they excite. The
character of <HI>Iago</HI> is dete&s;table, but we ad|mire
<HI>Shake&s;pear's</HI> repre&s;entation of it. Nay
imperfect and mixt characters are, in all
kinds of writing, preferred to faultle&s;s ones,
as being ju&s;ter copies of real nature. The
plea&s;ant &s;en&s;ation re&s;ulting from the imita|tion
is &s;o inten&s;e, that it overpowers and con|verts
into delight even the <HI>unea&s;y</HI> impre&s;&s;ions,
which &s;pring from the objects imitated.
There can be no &s;tronger proof of the force
of imitation in conferring on its effects the
power of plea&s;ing, than its rendering tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;ions agreeable, when excited by it, which,
when produced in the natural way, are pure
and unmixt pain. Su&s;pen&s;e, anxiety, terror,
when produced in Tragedy, by imitation of
their objects and cau&s;es, and infu&s;ed by &s;ym|pathy,
afford not only a more &s;erious, but a
much inten&s;er and nobler &s;atisfaction, than
all the laughter and joy, which farce or co|medy
can in&s;pire, When thus &s;econdarily
produced, they agitate and employ the mind,
and rou&s;e and give &s;cope to its greate&s;t activi|ty;
while at the &s;ame time our implicit
knowledge that the occa&s;ion is remote or fic|titious,
enables the plea&s;ure of imitation to
<PB N="55" REF="59">
relieve the pure torment, which would at|tend
their primary operation.</P>
<P>FROM what has been &s;aid, it is obvious
that the plea&s;ure of imitation ari&s;es from a
combination of cau&s;es. Be&s;ides the act of
compari&s;on, which is the &s;ame in all in&s;tan|ces,
the exactne&s;s of the re&s;emblance, our
di&s;covery of it, and the art we conceive ne|ce&s;&s;ary
for producing it, concur to make up
our gratification.</P>
<P>EXACTNESS of re&s;emblance is &s;carce farther
approved, than as it evidences &s;kill and ena|bles
us to to di&s;cover the original. <HI>Ca|ravaggio</HI>
is cen&s;urable for too clo&s;ely follow|ing
the life, as well as <HI>Gio&s;eppino</HI> for wanton|ly
deviating from it into fanta&s;tical extrava|gances.
Among the antient &s;tatuaries like|wi&s;e,
<HI>Demetrius</HI> is cen&s;ured for being too
&s;tudious of likene&s;s, and &s;acrificing beauty to
it; and is on this account reckoned inferior
to <HI>Ly&s;ippus</HI> and <HI>Praxiteles,</HI> who, at the &s;ame
time that they excelled in producing like|ne&s;s,
carried it no farther than was con&s;i&s;tent
with beauty<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ad veritatem <HI>Ly&s;ippum</HI> et <HI>Praxitelem</HI> acce&s;&s;i&s;&s;e optime affirmant. Nam <HI>Demetrius</HI> tanquam nimius in ea reprehen|ditur, et $uit &s;imilitudinis quam pulchritudinis amantior. <BIBL><HI>Q$int. In&s;tit. Orat.</HI> lib. xii. cap. 10.</BIBL></NOTE>. Exactne&s;s of re&s;emblance may
<PB N="56" REF="60">
be carried &s;o far in any work of genius, as
to degenerate into di&s;agreeable &s;ervility; and
is ea&s;ily di&s;pen&s;ed with, when the deviation
from &s;imilitude appears to be the re&s;ult of &s;u|perior
art. However, that in&s;trument of imi|tation
is doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t perfect, which is
capable of producing the mo&s;t perfect likene&s;s.
Among the fine arts, this preeminence, in
mo&s;t &s;ubjects, belongs to &s;culpture; and
more to painting, in &s;ubjects perfectly adapted
to it, than to poetry.</P>
<P>BUT even the imperfection of the in&s;tru|ment
of imitation may &s;ometimes add merit
to the effect. Though it renders the re&s;em|blance
le&s;s accurate, this very circum&s;tance
enhances the plea&s;ure, by producing a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of greater &s;agacity in di&s;covering
the original; at the &s;ame time that the pro|duction
of likene&s;s with unapt materials, im|plying
greater difficulty, gives ri&s;e to an high|er
approbation of the ingenuity of the arti&s;t.
In this re&s;pect painting is more artificial than
&s;tatuary. For that rea&s;on a fine picture will
in&s;pire full as great plea&s;ure as a &s;tatue. Its
repre&s;enting &s;olid bodies, only by the di&s;po|&s;ition
of light and &s;hade, tho' it&s;elf a plane, is a
<PB N="57" REF="61">
proof of the highe&s;t &s;kill. And could a per|&s;on
be formed to delicacy of ta&s;te, and yet
kept from &s;eeing a picture till he were adult;
it is &s;carce conceivable what rapture he &s;hould
feel, when he fir&s;t di&s;covered it to be but a
plane variou&s;ly &s;haded, after having firmly
believed, that, like the objects he had been
accu&s;tomed to, it had it&s;elf the prominences
and cavities which it repre&s;ents<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Hence in the celebrated conte&s;t between a painter and a &s;tatuary, concerning the merit of their arts&punc; both argued from real principles of excellence; the &s;tatuary pleading the per|fection of re&s;emblance in his art; the painter the &s;uperior in|genuity which his di&s;covered. The blind man gave the pre|ference to the latter. The controver&s;y cannot be determined, till it is previou&s;ly fixed, which principle is, on the whole, eligible.</NOTE>. And
as every difficulty of execution heightens our
idea of the &s;kill by which it is &s;urmounted,
not only the <HI>importance</HI> of the work, but al&s;o the
<HI>difficulty</HI> of repre&s;enting pa&s;&s;ion and character by
figure and colour, increa&s;e the beauty of hi&s;to|ry-painting.
In this view poetry, imitating by
in&s;tituted &s;ymbols, noways re&s;embling things,
is on mo&s;t &s;ubjects more imperfectly mimetic
than the other arts: but this imperfection gives
it a kind of merit, as that art is able notwith|&s;tanding
to &s;ugge&s;t very lively ideas of its ob|jects.
But what con&s;titutes its unque&s;tionable
<PB N="58" REF="62">
&s;uperiority to all its &s;i&s;ter arts, is its peculiar
and unrivaled power of imitating the noble&s;t
and mo&s;t important of all &s;ubjects, the calme&s;t
&s;entiments of the heart, and human charac|ters
di&s;played in a long &s;eries of conduct. For
in determining the comparative merit of the
imitative arts, we mu&s;t not only e&s;timate the
excellencies of the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> or <HI>manners</HI> of
imitation, which they re&s;pectively claim; but
al&s;o the moment of what they imitate, the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te of harmony.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;en&s;e of harmony, which confers
a kind of beauty upon &s;ound, not
only is conver&s;ant in all the arts which employ
language, but it&s;elf lays the &s;ole foundation
of the art of mu&s;ic. By it the ear derives
from its objects a plea&s;ure &s;imilar to what the
eye receives from forms. This plea&s;ure is
re&s;olvable into the agreeablene&s;s of <HI>&s;ingle</HI>
&s;ounds, and into the charms and energy of a
&s;killful <HI>complication</HI> of them.</P>
<P>SINGLE &s;ounds are either loud or low,
acute or grave, &s;lender or full, even or bro|ken.
To the&s;e qualities attention mu&s;t be
paid, if we would plea&s;e the ear. If &s;ounds
are too <HI>low,</HI> they do not &s;trike with force
enough to gratify: if too <HI>loud,</HI> they confound
us. Great <HI>acutene&s;s</HI> lacerates the organ: and
an exce&s;s of <HI>gravity</HI> renders the impre&s;&s;ion
too dull and &s;piritle&s;s to plea&s;e. <HI>Exility</HI> hin|ders
&s;ounds from &s;ufficiently filling the ear,
and thence is attended with a perception of
<PB N="60" REF="64">
meanne&s;s and futility: but <HI>full</HI> and &s;welling
notes, by occupying its whole expan&s;ion, ac|quire
grandeur and in&s;pire delight. <HI>Broken</HI>
&s;ounds grate the ear, by their har&s;h inequa|lities:
<HI>&s;moothne&s;s</HI> and evenne&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to
prevent their being di&s;agreeable.</P>
<P>HARMONY pre&s;uppo&s;es the agreeablene&s;s
of the &s;eparate notes, but it is produced only
by a <HI>combination</HI> of &s;ounds. The different
compo&s;itions of articulate &s;ounds, added to
the &s;eparate qualities of each, render &s;ome
words harmonious, others har&s;h. Some ar|ticulate
&s;ounds do not ea&s;ily concur; the
tran&s;ition from one configuration of the or|gans
of &s;peech to the other, is difficult and
unea&s;y; and the hearer is led by a delicate
&s;ympathy with the &s;peaker, to feel this pain
and labour. It is the frequency of &s;uch com|binations,
that prevents euphony in any
tongue; and renders &s;ome languages le&s;s
&s;mooth and harmonious than others. In &s;en|tences,
periods, and di&s;cour&s;es, the harmony
or the a&s;perity of &s;tyle ari&s;es from the repe|tition
of &s;ounds and combinations &s;eparately
agreeable or di&s;agreeable: and the harmony
is rendered more delightful, by the <HI>variety</HI>
which the length of the compo&s;ition admits.
<PB N="61" REF="65">
The importance of variety we &s;hall acknow|ledge,
if we but reflect how tire&s;ome &s;ame|ne&s;s
of cadence is. The &s;uperior harmony
of Poetry is produced by the greater facility
of its combinations, joined to a con&s;iderable
degree of <HI>uniformity,</HI> and a regular <HI>proportion</HI>
in time; the proper method of obtaining
which, in every language, determines its pro&s;|ody:
and the variety of the means to be
employed for this end in different languages
introduces a &s;imilar variety in the genius and
mea&s;ure of their ver&s;e.</P>
<P>WHENEVER our plea&s;ure ari&s;es from a &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
of &s;ounds, it is a perception of a com|plicated
nature; made up of a <HI>&s;en&s;ation</HI> of the
pre&s;ent &s;ound or note, and an <HI>idea</HI> or remem|brance
of the foregoing, which by their mixture
and concurrence, produce &s;uch a my&s;terious de|light,
as neither could have produced alone.
And it is often heightened by an <HI>anticipation</HI>
of the &s;ucceeding notes. Hence it proceeds
in part, that we are in general be&s;t plea&s;ed
with pieces of mu&s;ic, which we are acquaint|ed
with: our under&s;tanding them more tho|roughly
counter balances the power of novelty.
Hence too it is, that we often acquire in time
<PB N="62" REF="66">
a fondne&s;s for what at fir&s;t we did not highly
reli&s;h; the anticipation, which repetition
enables us to make of the &s;ucceeding note,
&s;upplying the defect in the &s;en&s;ation of the
pre&s;ent, and the idea of the pa&s;t &s;ound when
di&s;united from it, cementing them as it
were, and making them run into one another
without difficulty or har&s;hne&s;s. Sen&s;e, Me|mory,
and Imagination are thus conjunctively
employed, in exhibiting to the interior organ
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ounds, which properly di&s;po|&s;ed,
e&s;pecially in mu&s;ic, fill us with exqui&s;ite
delight.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable that the proper and plea&s;|ing
di&s;po&s;ition of &s;ounds in <HI>melody</HI> bears a great
re&s;emblance, in its principles, to that arrange|ment
of parts, which con&s;titutes the beauty of
forms. It is a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of notes, bearing to
one another a regular <HI>proportion</HI> in time;
&s;o <HI>varied</HI> in their lengths and intervals<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">As the great force of <HI>proportion</HI> in time is evident from the univer&s;al attention, that is paid to it in Mu&s;ic of every kind; &s;o the influence of <HI>variety</HI> of time appears particularly in the Drum, the whole Mu&s;ic of which is owing to it alone.</NOTE>,

from no other cau&s;e, but its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;ome
of the&s;e qualities in greater perfection. The
<HI>uniformity</HI> is pre&s;erved almo&s;t undimini&s;hed;
the different parts being &s;o combined, that no
di&s;&s;onance is occa&s;ioned by their multiplicity;
but the concordant notes, melted into one ano|ther,
&s;trike the ear together without confu|&s;ion
or di&s;traction. With this &s;implicity, an
immen&s;e <HI>variety</HI> is made con&s;i&s;tent; each &s;e|parate
part being a di&s;tinct &s;eries of artfully
varied &s;ounds; the melody of all the parts
being enjoyed at once: the vibrations of the
concords coinciding not always, but at regu|lar
periods; the diver&s;ity of the concords and
their &s;ucce&s;&s;ions producing a great diver&s;ity of
harmonies; and the judicious intermixture
of di&s;cords preventing the &s;en&s;e from being
cloyed with &s;ymphony too long continued.
At the &s;ame time, the <HI>proportion</HI> is rendered
more con&s;picuous and artful, by its being
pre&s;erved in all the parts; and a new kind
<PB N="64" REF="68">
of it is introduced by their comparative
&s;trength. So great is the efficacy of the&s;e
principles, that they alone produce very high
plea&s;ure, though no pa&s;&s;ion is excited by the
mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till the chief excellence of Mu&s;ic lies
in its <HI>expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> By this quality, mu&s;ic is ap|plied
to a determinate &s;ubject: by this it ac|quires

each other into the mind; mu&s;ic, producing

characters and conduct we di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
the right and the wrong, the excel|lent
and the faulty; but it al&s;o &s;preads its
influence over all the mo&s;t con&s;iderable works

the mo&s;t ludicrous. It claims a <HI>joint autho|rity</HI>
with the other principles of Ta&s;te; it
requires an attachment to morality in the
epos and the drama, and it pronounces the
quicke&s;t flights of wit, without it, phren&s;y
and di&s;traction. Something moral has in|&s;inuated
it&s;elf, not only into the &s;erious de&s;igns
of <HI>Raphael,</HI> but al&s;o into the humourous re|pre&s;entations
of <HI>Hogarth.</HI></P>
<P>NAY our moral &s;en&s;e claims authority <HI>&s;u|perior</HI>
to all the re&s;t. It renders morality
the chief requi&s;ite; and where this is in any
<PB N="75" REF="79">
degree violated, no other qualities can attone
for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. Particular beauties
may be approved, but the work is, on the
whole, condemned.</P>
<P>How great a part of the &s;entiments pro|duced
by works of genius ari&s;es from the
exertion of this &s;en&s;e, approving or condemn|ing,
is too obvious to require our dwelling on
it. The noble&s;t and mo&s;t delightful &s;ubjects
of imitation are affections, characters, and
actions: and their peculiar merit ari&s;es almo&s;t
entirely from their continually drawing out
and employing the moral faculty. By its
approbation, more effectually than by any
other means, we become intere&s;ted for &s;ome of
the per&s;ons repre&s;ented, and &s;ympathi&s;e with
every change in their condition. It fills us with
joyful approbation of the virtuouscharacter, and
with abhorrence, not ungrateful when thus ex|cited,
of the vicious. When pro&s;perity and &s;uc|ce&s;s
attend the former, we feel his good de&s;ert,
we rejoice to find it meet its due reward, we
are compo&s;ed into delightful &s;erenity, compla|cence
and affiance in righteous providence:
when he is &s;unk into di&s;appointment and ad|ver&s;ity,
we are &s;en&s;ible that he de&s;erved it
not, and ta&s;te the plea&s;urable pain of com|pa&s;&s;ion
<PB N="76" REF="80">
for his &s;ufferings, and virtuous re|&s;entment
again&s;t the authors of them. When
the vicious man is pro&s;perous, we glow with
indignation, we feel a kind of melancholy de|&s;pondence:
when he &s;uffers, we become
&s;en&s;ible to the danger of vice, to the terrors
of guilt; we allow his ill de&s;ert, but mix pity
with our blame. We are thus agitated by
tho&s;e mo&s;t important pa&s;&s;ions; the infu&s;ion
of which con&s;titutes the highe&s;t entertainment
that works of ta&s;te can give.</P>
<P>BUT what exten&s;ive influence the moral
&s;en&s;e has on ta&s;te of every kind, it will be
unnece&s;&s;ary particularly to de&s;cribe, if we
only recollect the various perceptions which
it conveys. To it belongs our perception of
the fairne&s;s, beauty, and loveline&s;s of vir|tue,
of the ugline&s;s, deformity, and hateful|ne&s;s
of vice, produced by the native qualities
of each con&s;idered &s;imply. From it is deri|ved
our perception of decency, fitne&s;s, and
congruity in the former; of incongruity, inde|cency
and unfitne&s;s in the latter; which ari&s;es
from implicit compari&s;on of them, with the
&s;tructure and con&s;titution of the mind. By
it we perceive that virtue is obligatory, right,
and due; and that vice is undue, unlawful,
<PB N="77" REF="81">
and wrong: the perception &s;prings from the
&s;upremacy of our approving and di&s;approving
faculty, as our internal governour pre&s;cribing
a law of life. The &s;ame &s;en&s;e conveys a per|ception
of merit and good de&s;ert in virtue, of
demerit and ill de&s;ert in vice; a perception,
which never fails to be excited, when we
think at once of moral and natural good or
evil. From this variety of &s;en&s;ations ari&s;e
all the reflex pa&s;&s;ions which regard good or
bad men as their objects. How much the&s;e
&s;entiments and affections enter into the per|ceptions
of ta&s;te, the lea&s;t reflection will in|form
us.</P>
<P>THUS much may &s;uffice for an Analy&s;is
of ta&s;te into tho&s;e &s;imple powers of human
nature, which are its principles. There are
qualities in things, determinate and &s;table,
independent of humour or caprice, that are
fit to operate on mental principles, common
to all men, and, by operating on them, are
naturally productive of the &s;entiments of ta&s;te
in all its forms. If, in any particular in|&s;tance,
they prove ineffectual, it is to be
a&s;cribed to &s;ome weakne&s;s or di&s;order in the
per&s;on, who remains unmoved, when the&s;e
qualities are exhibited to his view. Men
<PB N="78" REF="82">

by novelty; how weakly the &s;ublime&s;t
objects often &s;trike us, when by long cu&s;tom
they have become familiar. The &s;ublimity
of the heavens could not fail to enrapture one
unaccu&s;tomed to the glorious &s;pectacle. Tho'

receive along with it other plea&s;urable feel|ings.

The mo&s;t elevating objects in nature

<PB N="82" REF="86">
as de&s;tined for Empire univer&s;al, as pre&s;cri|bing

attended by the graceful.</P>
<P>POETRY is a complication of beauties, re|flecting
by their union additional lu&s;tre on one
another. The &s;ublime, the new, the ele|gant,
the natural, the virtuous, are often
blended in the imitation; brighten'd by the
power of fiction, and the riche&s;t variety of
imagery; and rendered more delightful by
the harmony of numbers. When Poetry is
&s;et to well adapted mu&s;ic, both gain <HI>new</HI>
power by their alliance. The mu&s;ic, by
<PB N="83" REF="87">
exciting the requi&s;ite affections, puts the
mind in a di&s;po&s;ition to conceive ideas &s;uited
to them with peculiar facility, vivacity, and
plea&s;ure. The&s;e ideas the Poet rai&s;es: and
they, in their turn, enliven the affections,
and pre&s;erve them from langui&s;hing or ex|piring,
by rendering their objects more de|terminate.
But in order to experience this
compound plea&s;ure, both a mu&s;ical ear and
a poetic ta&s;te are requi&s;ite: the want of
either extingui&s;hes one part of the delight,
and very much dimini&s;hes the other.</P>
<P>THE degree of force with which objects

di&s;po&s;ition of the mind. Things of|ten
affect us deeply, when we are in an hu|mour
&s;uited to them, tho' at another time
they would make &s;mall impre&s;&s;ion. The &s;mal|le&s;t
injury may produce fury in a per&s;on na|turally
pa&s;&s;ionate, or by accident chagrined.
When the temper of the mind is &s;uch, as
gives it an habitual turn to one kind of &s;en|timents
and affections, it enters into them,
whenever they occur, with extraordinary &s;pi|rit.
As they fall in with its predominant
bent, no force is required to adapt it to the
perception of them; it &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and
<PB N="84" REF="88">
even eagerly embraces them, as perfectly con|formable
to its frame.</P>
<P>Now as all the objects of the &s;ame inter|nal
&s;en&s;e, however various, have their com|mon
qualities,; &s;o all the&s;e &s;en&s;es are analo|gous
in their principles and feeling. The
&s;ame turn of mind is, on this account, con|gruous
to them all. The prevalence and ex|erci&s;e,
of any one of them di&s;po&s;es and at|tunes
the mind to all the re&s;t. And this pre|vious
di&s;po&s;ition to them be&s;tows &s;trength
and vigour on all their exertions. In fact,
the kindred powers of ta&s;te are &s;eldom di&s;u|nited.
Where all of them have con&s;iderable
vigour, one may be, in compari&s;on with the
re&s;t, predominant; either by the natural con|&s;truction
of the mind, or by peculiar culture.
But where one of them is remarkably dull,
or altogether wanting, the others &s;carce ever
appear in full perfection.</P>
<P>THE union of the&s;e powers has a farther
influence in forming ta&s;te, as that union opens
a new field, in which ta&s;te may exerci&s;e it|&s;elf
and gather flowers to adorn the native
beauty of its objects. As the fine arts are
truly &s;i&s;ters, derived from the &s;ame common
<PB N="85" REF="89">

<P><PB N="86" REF="90">
IN all the&s;e ways our interior &s;en&s;es, mere|ly
by their union, tend to form and perfect
Ta&s;te.</P>
<P>WE may here take occa&s;ion to mention a
principle, di&s;tinct from all the internal &s;en|&s;es,
from which ta&s;te will, in many in&s;tances,
receive a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It is &s;uch a <HI>&s;en&s;ibility of
heart,</HI> as fits a man for being ea&s;ily moved,
and for readily catching, as by infection, any
pa&s;&s;ion, that a work is fitted to excite. The
fouls of men are far from being alike &s;u&s;|ceptible
of impre&s;&s;ions of this kind. A
hard hearted man can be a &s;pectator of very
great di&s;tre&s;s, without feeling any emotion:
A man of a cruel temper has a malignant
joy in producing mi&s;ery. On the other
hand, many are compo&s;ed of &s;o delicate ma|terials,
that the &s;malle&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s of their
fellow creatures excites their pity. A &s;imi|lar
variety may be ob&s;erved, in re&s;pect of the
other pa&s;&s;ions. Per&s;ons of the former ca&s;t
will be little affected by the mo&s;t moving
tragedy; tho&s;e of the latter turn will be in|tere&s;ted
by a very indifferent one. A per|formance,
which can in&s;u&s;e the keene&s;t
pa&s;&s;ions into the brea&s;t of an <HI>Italian,</HI> will af|fect
<PB N="87" REF="91">
a <HI>Frenchman</HI> very little, and leave an
<HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> perfectly unconcerned. We are
apt to be a&s;toni&s;hed, when we read of the
prodigious force, with which eloquence
wrought upon the delicate &s;pirits of the <HI>Athe|nians,</HI>
and feel &s;o little of any thing analo|gous
to it, that nothing but the mo&s;t unex|ceptionable
evidence could make it credible.
This diver&s;ity in the formation of the heart
will produce a con&s;iderable diver&s;ity in the
&s;entiments, which men receive from works
of ta&s;te, and in the judgment, which they
form concerning them.</P>
<P>A VERY great part of the merit of mo&s;t
works of genius ari&s;es from their fitne&s;s to
agitate the heart with a variety of pa&s;&s;ions.
In the mo&s;t excellent mu&s;ic, the agreeable|ne&s;s
of the melody, and the richne&s;s of the
harmony, are only &s;ub&s;ervient to the expre&s;|&s;ion.
It is &s;o much the bu&s;ine&s;s of painting
and poetry to affect us, by infu&s;ing &s;uitable
pa&s;&s;ions, that a very ingenious critic<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The ABBE DU BOS. <HI>See Reflex. Critiq, &s;ur la po&euml;&s;ie &amp; &s;ur la peinture,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> has
mi&s;taken it for the <HI>only</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e arts.
Some kinds of poetry are addre&s;&s;ed princi|pally
to the powers of imagination, and attain
<PB N="88" REF="92">
their ultimate end, by exhibiting pictures
of &s;uch objects as gratify our internal &s;en&s;es.
Such particularly is de&s;criptive poetry. But
even this kind will &s;oon grow languid and
unentertaining, if it does not &s;upport it&s;elf, by
introducing &s;ubjects of an affecting nature.
In dramatic poetry, and in eloquence, the
ultimate end is to affect; whatever only
plea&s;es the internal &s;en&s;es is &s;ubordinate to
this end, and becomes faulty, if it be not con|ducive
to it&punc;</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the pathetic is a quality
of &s;o great moment in works of ta&s;te, a man,
who is de&s;titute of &s;en&s;ibility of heart, mu&s;t
be a very imperfect judge of them. He is a
&s;tranger to tho&s;e feelings, which are of greate&s;t
importance to direct his judgment. If a per&s;on
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the internal &s;en&s;es in perfection,
without delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion, he could e&s;timate
the principal works of genius, only by their
inferior qualities. In a tragedy, he might
perceive whether de&s;criptions of natural ob|jects
are beautiful or &s;ublime, whether the
characters are natural and well &s;upported,
whether the &s;entiments are ju&s;t and noble;
he might examine, with coldne&s;s and indif|ference,
the beauties and the faults of the
<PB N="89" REF="93">
compo&s;ition: but whether it has accompli&s;h|ed
its main end, whether the fable is fit to
produce pity and terror in the &s;pectators, he
mu&s;t be totally at a lo&s;s to determine. In a
word, he can have no reli&s;h for any thing
that is addre&s;&s;ed to the <HI>heart.</HI></P>
<P>DELICACY of pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be united with
vigorous internal &s;en&s;es, in order to give ta&s;te
its ju&s;t extent. Where this union takes
place, works of genius produce their full ef|fect;
and in&s;pire a complicated plea&s;ure. A
man receives adequate perceptions of all their
qualities, and, by this, means, has it in his
power to allow each its proper weight in de|termining
his judgment concerning the me|rit
of the whole. Delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion may
intere&s;t a per&s;on &s;o much, that he cannot for
&s;ome time examine a performance with cri|tical
exactne&s;s; but it gives him exqui&s;ite
delight in the mean time, and enables him
to pa&s;s a ju&s;t &s;entence at la&s;t.</P>

<P>THE compleate&s;t <HI>union</HI> of the internal

good ta&s;te, even though they be attended

objects and their qualities. Judgment mu&s;t
indeed accompany even their mo&s;t <HI>imperfect</HI>
exertions. They do not operate, till certain
qualities in objects have been perceived, di&s;|criminated
from others &s;imilar, compared
and compounded. In all this judgment is
employed: it bears a part in the di&s;cern|ment
and production of every form that
&s;trikes them, But in a&s;&s;i&s;ting their <HI>perfect</HI>
energies, it has a &s;till more exten&s;ive in|fluence.
Good &s;en&s;e is an indi&s;pen&s;able in|ingredient
in true ta&s;te, which always im|plies
a quick and accurate perception of
things as they really are.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="95">
THAT judgment may compleatly exhibit
to the internal &s;en&s;es, the beauties and ex|cellencies
of <HI>nature,</HI> it mea&s;ures the ampli|tude
of things, determines their proportions,
and traces out their wife con&s;truction and be|neficial
tendency. It u&s;es all the methods,
which art and &s;cience indicate for di&s;covering
tho&s;e qualities that lie too deep &s;pontaneou&s;ly
to &s;trike the eye. It inve&s;tigates the laws
and cau&s;es of the works of <HI>nature:</HI> it com|pares
and contra&s;ts them with the more im|perfect
works of <HI>art;</HI> and thus &s;upplies
materials, from which fancy may produce
ideas and form combinations, that will
&s;trongly affect the mental ta&s;te.</P>
<P>JUDGMENT finds out the general charac|ters
of <HI>each art,</HI> and, by comparing them,
draws conclu&s;ions concerning the relations,
which &s;ub&s;i&s;t between <HI>different</HI> arts. Till
it has di&s;covered the&s;e, none of them can
acquire that additional power of plea&s;ing,
which is imparted to them by their recipro|cal
connection.</P>
<P>IN every art, a ju&s;t performance con&s;i&s;ts
of various parts, combined into one &s;y&s;tem,
and &s;ub&s;ervient to one de&s;ign, But without
<PB N="92" REF="96">
the exerci&s;e of judgment, we cannot know
whether the de&s;ign is &s;killfully pro&s;ecuted,
whether the means are well adju&s;ted to the
end, whether every member, which is intro|duced,
has a tendency to promote it.</P>
<P>IN <HI>mu&s;ic</HI> the <HI>ear</HI> immediately perceives
the plea&s;ure re&s;ulting from each principle:
But <HI>judgment,</HI> a&s;&s;uming the perceptions of
that organ, compares them, and by compa|ri&s;on
determines their re&s;pective merit and
due proportion. It enables the ear, from its
di&s;covery of the general relations, to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
with preci&s;ion between invention and
extravagance, to di&s;cern the &s;uitablene&s;s or
un&s;uitablene&s;s of the parts, and their fitne&s;s
or unfilne&s;s to &s;u&s;tain the main &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN <HI>painting</HI> judgment di&s;covers the mean|ing
of the piece, not only remotely, as it is
the in&s;trument of that previous knowledge,
which is nece&s;&s;ary for under&s;tanding it; but
al&s;o more immediately, as from the &s;tructure
and relation of the parts it infers the general
de&s;ign, and explains their &s;ub&s;erviency to the
main end of the whole. It compares the
imitation with its exemplar, and &s;ees its
likene&s;s. It is judgment, working on our
<PB N="93" REF="97">
experience, that puts it in our power to know,
whether the painter has fixed upon the atti|tudes
and airs in nature appropriated to the
pa&s;&s;ions, characters, and actions he would re|pre&s;ent;
and, when the&s;e attitudes are various,
whether he has cho&s;en tho&s;e, which mo&s;t per|fectly
corre&s;pond with the unity and propriety
of his de&s;ign. Painting being circum&s;cribed to
an in&s;tant of time, judgment alone can perceive,
whether that in&s;tant is properly &s;elected,
whether the arti&s;t has pitched on that mo|ment,
which comprehends the circum&s;tances
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the grand event, and be&s;t al|lows,
without a deviation from &s;implicity, the
indication of the other requi&s;ite circum&s;tances.
It e&s;timatesthe due proportion of all the fi|gures,
in dignity, elegance, and lu&s;tre, and
their due &s;ubordination to the principal. In
fine, it is nece&s;&s;arily employed in that exhibi|tion
of the object to the &s;en&s;es, which mu&s;t
be previous to their perception of it.</P>
<P>IN order to approve or condemn in <HI>poetry</HI>
or <HI>eloquence,</HI> we mu&s;t take into view at once,
and compare &s;o many particulars, that none
can he&s;itate to acknowledge the ab&s;olute ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of a &s;ound and vigorous judgment.
We mu&s;t determine, whether the fable or
<PB N="94" REF="98">
de&s;ign is well imagined in congruity to the
&s;pecies of the poem or di&s;cour&s;e; whether
all the incidents or arguments are natural
members of it; which of them promotes its
force or beauty, or which, by its want of
connection, ob&s;tructs the end, or debilitates
its gennine effect; what degree of relation
is &s;ufficient to introduce epi&s;odes, illu&s;trations
or digre&s;&s;ions, &s;o that they may appear, not
excre&s;cences and deformities, but &s;uitable de|corations.
It is <HI>&s;en&s;e,</HI> which is plea&s;ed or
di&s;plea&s;ed, when the&s;e things are determined:
but <HI>judgment</HI> alone can determine them, and
pre&s;ent to &s;en&s;e the object of its perception.
By an accurate &s;crutiny of the various rela|tions
of the parts, judgment fixes that &s;itua|tion,
in which they will appear with greate&s;t
advantage, and mo&s;t promote that regular
organization, on which both the elegance
and vigour of the whole depends. It com|pares
characters with nature; and pronoun|ces
them either real, or mon&s;trous. It com|pares
them with other characters; and finds
them good or bad in the kind, properly or
improperly marked. It compares them with
them&s;elves; and di&s;covers whether they are
con&s;i&s;tent or incon&s;i&s;tent, well or ill &s;upport|ed,
whether their peculiar decorum is pre|&s;erved
<PB N="95" REF="99">
or violated. Truth and ju&s;tne&s;s is
the foundation of every beauty in &s;entiment:
It imparts to it that &s;olidity, without which
it may dazzle a vulgar eye, but can never
plea&s;e one who looks beyond the fir&s;t appear|ance.
And to a&s;certain truth, to unma&s;k
fal&s;ehood however artfully di&s;gui&s;ed, is the
peculiar prerogative of judgment. The
fine&s;t &s;entiments, if applied to &s;ubjects un&s;uit|able,
may not only lo&s;e their beauty, but even
throw deformity upon the whole: and judg|ment
alone perceives the fitne&s;s or unfitne&s;s
of their application. This faculty arrogates
al&s;o to it&s;elf, in &s;ome degree, the cognizance
of &s;tyle and language; and, by bringing it
to the te&s;t of cu&s;tom, di&s;covers its propriety,
purity, and elegance. Judgment, not &s;atis|fied
with examining the &s;eparate parts, com|bines
them and the feelings they produce, in
order to e&s;timate the merit of the whole.
It &s;ettles the relative value of different
poems and di&s;cour&s;es, of the &s;ame or various
kinds, by a &s;tudious and &s;evere compari&s;on
of the dignity of their ends, the moment
of their effects, the &s;uitablene&s;s, difficulty,
and ingenuity of the means employed.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="100">
THUS in all the operations of ta&s;te, judg|ment
is employed; not only in pre&s;enting
the &s;ubjects, on which the &s;en&s;es exerci&s;e
them&s;elves; but al&s;o in comparing and
weighing their perceptions and decrees, and
thence pa&s;&s;ing ultimate &s;entence upon the
whole.</P>
<P>BUT, though the reflex &s;en&s;es and judg|ment
meet, yet, in a con&s;i&s;tence with true
ta&s;te, they may be united in very different
proportions. In &s;ome, the acutene&s;s of the
<HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> in others, the accuracy of <HI>judgment</HI> is
the predominant ingredient. Both will de|termine
ju&s;tly, but they are guided by dif|ferent
lights; the former, by the perception
of &s;en&s;e, the latter, by the conviction of the
under&s;tanding. One <HI>feels</HI> what plea&s;es or
di&s;plea&s;es; the other <HI>knows</HI> what ought to
gratify or di&s;gu&s;t. Sen&s;e has a kind of in|&s;tinctive
infallibility, by means of which,
when it is vigorous, it can pre&s;erve from er|ror,
though judgment &s;hould not be perfect.
Judgment, by contemplating the qualities
that affect ta&s;te, by &s;urveying it's &s;entiments
in their cau&s;es, often makes amends for dul|ne&s;s
of imagination. Where <HI>that</HI> prevails,
<PB N="97" REF="101">
one's chief entertainment from Works of ge|nius
lies in what he feels: where <HI>this</HI> is predo|minant,
one enjoys principally the intellectual
plea&s;ure, which re&s;ults from di&s;covering the
cau&s;es of his feelings. This diver&s;ity in the
form and con&s;titution of ta&s;te is very ob&s;erva|ble
in two of the greate&s;t criticks of antiqui|ty.
<HI>Longinus</HI> is ju&s;tly characteri&s;ed

delicate; but his judgment, though good,
was not in proportion. On this account he
delivers ju&s;t &s;entiments, with rapture and
enthu&s;ia&s;m, and, by a kind of contagion,
infu&s;es them into his readers, without always
explaining to them the rea&s;on of their being &s;o
affected. <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> on the contrary appears to
examine his &s;ubject, perfectly cool and un|affected;
he di&s;covers no warmth of imagina|tion,
no &s;uch admiration or extacy, as can,
without reflection, tran&s;port his readers into
his opinion. He derives his deci&s;ions, not
from the liveline&s;s of feeling, but from
the depth of penetration; and &s;eldom

&s;ome defect, corrects &s;ome inaccuracy,

<HI>habit,</HI> which is the grand, indeed the only,
immediate means of improvement of every
kind, extending it's power to all our facul|ties,

charmed with an appearance of ingenuity in
their diver&s;ions; prone to imitate, and grati|fied
by every effect of imitation which they
are capable of ob&s;erving: they are very
quick in di&s;cerning oddity, and highly enter|tained
with the di&s;covery of it; and will
hardly ever fail of pa&s;&s;ing a right judgment
concerning characters, when the&s;e characters
are exerted in a &s;eries of actions level to their

under&s;tandings. But a &s;mall degree of excel|lence
&s;atisfies them; a fal&s;e &s;emblance of it is
ea&s;ily impo&s;ed on them for the true; any di&s;|gui&s;e
mi&s;leads them. The daubing of a &s;ign|po&s;t,
the improbable tales of nur&s;es, the unna|tural
adventures of chivalry, the har&s;h numbers
of <HI>Grub-&s;treet</HI> rhyme, the grating notes of a
&s;trolling fidler, the coar&s;e&s;t buffoonry, are &s;uf|ficient
todelight them. In &s;ome, for want of
exerci&s;e and culture, the &s;ame gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and
contraction of ta&s;te continues always, or it is ap|plied
in a low, perver&s;e, or whim&s;ical manner.
They may de&s;pi&s;e a reli&s;h for <HI>childi&s;h</HI> trifles;
but them&s;elves enter into <HI>important</HI> &s;ubjects,
with as little reli&s;h as the mere&s;t children; or
are perhaps delighted with <HI>other trifles,</HI> a very
little different or &s;uperior in kind. Of dre&s;s
or equipage, of the beauties of a tulip, of a
&s;hell, or a butterfly, they are accurate jud|ges
and high admirers. But the &s;ublimity
of nature, the ingenuity of art, the grace of
painting, the charms of genuine poetry, the
&s;implicity of pa&s;toral, the boldne&s;s of the ode,
the affecting incidents of tragedy, the ju&s;t
repre&s;entation of comedy; the&s;e are &s;ubjects
of which they under&s;tand nothing, of which
they can form no judgment. Many who
pretend to judge, having pur&s;ued a wrong

powers. They are in &s;ome of &s;o
<HI>tender</HI> and delicate a &s;tructure, that they are
<HI>&s;trongly affected</HI> both with plea&s;ure and pain.
In others their <HI>dullne&s;s</HI> renders both enjoy|ments

is in none of our powers more con&s;pi|cuous

<PB N="107" REF="111">
of rea&s;on, the gratification of appetite, or the
pur&s;uits of gain, are perfect &s;trangers to
the &s;atisfactions or unea&s;ine&s;&s;es of ta&s;te; they
can &s;carce form any idea of them. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI>
mentions a celebrated mathematician, who
was &s;o perfectly incapable of any impre&s;|&s;ion
from the charms of poetry, that he read
the <HI>Aeneid,</HI> with no other &s;atisfaction, than
what he derived from a compari&s;on of it,
with a map of the travels of <HI>Aeneas.</HI></P>
<P>SENSIBILITY very much depends on the
<HI>original</HI> con&s;truction of the mind; it being
le&s;s than any other of the qualities of good
ta&s;te <HI>improvable</HI> by u&s;e. The effect of <HI>habit</HI>
on our <HI>perceptions</HI> is the very rever&s;e of that,
which it produces on our <HI>active powers.</HI> It
<HI>&s;trengthens</HI> the latter, but gradually <HI>dimini&s;hes</HI>
the vivacity of the former. Cu&s;tom wears
off the difficulty of conception, which ren|ders
new objects peculiarly agreeable or di&s;a|greeable.
They come by repetition to enter
the mind with &s;o great facility, that they
give no exerci&s;e to its faculties; and of con|&s;equence
convey much le&s;s inten&s;e delight or
unea&s;ine&s;s than at fir&s;t. Hence it would
&s;eem to follow, that the more we are conver|&s;ant
with objects of ta&s;te, the le&s;s forcible
<PB N="108" REF="112">
our &s;entiments &s;hould be. And indeed the
mo&s;t <HI>unexperienced</HI> feel the mo&s;t <HI>turbulent</HI> and
<HI>violent</HI> plea&s;ure or pain. U&s;e renders both
more <HI>re&s;erved</HI> and ca&s;tigated.</P>
<Q>For fools <HI>admire,</HI> but men of &s;en&s;e <HI>approve.</HI></Q>
<P>But &s;till we find in fact, that an exten&s;ive ac|quaintance
with the beauties of art and na|ture
heightens our reli&s;h for them. When
we are accu&s;tomed to the &s;tudy, we can
&s;urvey no object with indifference; but re|ceive
higher plea&s;ure or more pungent di&s;gu&s;t,
than tho&s;e who&s;e ta&s;te is wholly unimproved.</P>
<P>THE following ob&s;ervations will account
for this &s;eeming paradox.</P>
<P>WERE the <HI>&s;ame</HI> object, however excel|lent,
to be continually pre&s;ented to our ta&s;te,
it mu&s;t &s;oon lo&s;e it's charms; fir&s;t becoming
indifferent, and then di&s;gu&s;ting, by the lan|guor,
which a continual identity of exerci&s;e
would introduce. Hence no natural &s;cene,
no production of art or genius can plea&s;e us
long, except every new &s;urvey di&s;covers
beauties unob&s;erved before, or gives us ad|ditional
a&s;&s;urance of it's perfection. But the
<PB N="109" REF="113">
objects of ta&s;te are infinitely various. One
who indulges it is continually changing his
&s;ubjects, and feeling plea&s;ures or pains
really di&s;tinct, though in the highe&s;t degree
analogous. He thus pre&s;erves a &s;ort of <HI>no|velty,</HI>
which tends to keep up the original
vivacity of his perceptions, and the continual
employment of ta&s;te produces &s;ome <HI>effects,</HI>
which compen&s;ate, nay, often overballance
the gradual decay of &s;en&s;ibility by repeti|tion.</P>
<P>IT is by enabling us to conceive objects
with <HI>facility,</HI> that cu&s;tom dimini&s;hes the
&s;trength of their impre&s;&s;ions. But <HI>facility,</HI>
if moderate, is a &s;cource of plea&s;ure: it will
therefore, by it's <HI>immediate</HI> influence, for
&s;ome time prevent our delight from being
weakened. It al&s;o renders our conceptions,
though le&s;s <HI>&s;triking,</HI> yet more <HI>complete</HI> and
accurate. A more perfect object is pre&s;ented
to the mind, than could be, previous to
u&s;e: and it's greater <HI>perfection</HI> may increa&s;e
our approbation or di&s;like, as much as <HI>novelty</HI>
did before: a performance often fails to plea&s;e
or di&s;gu&s;t, merely becau&s;e, having an inade|quate
idea of it's parts, we do not ob&s;erve
the qualities from which the&s;e &s;entiments
<PB N="110" REF="114">
&s;hould re&s;ult. A per&s;on un&s;killed in poetry
or painting will &s;urvey a work with perfect
indifference, becau&s;e he does not really &s;ee
it's beauties or it's blemi&s;hes. But let the&s;e
be pointed out to him, by one more knowing
in the art; immediately he begins to approve
or di&s;approve. Cu&s;tom &s;upplies the place
of an external monitor, by enabling us to
take in at one view a full perception of every
quality, on which the excellence or faultine&s;s
depends.</P>
<P>IT may be ob&s;erved farther, that ta&s;te,
being a faculty of a derivative kind, implies in
it's exertion mental <HI>actions,</HI> which are &s;trength|ened
by u&s;e and exerci&s;e. And <HI>their</HI> im|provement
tends to &s;upport the delicacy and
liveline&s;s of <HI>it's</HI> perceptions. Cu&s;tom &s;trength|ens
tho&s;e principles and proce&s;&s;es of thought,
by which our reflex &s;en&s;ations are produced;
and the &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t always bear &s;ome
proportion to the vigour of their cau&s;es.
The mind acquires a habit of enlarging it&s;elf
into the &s;entiment of &s;ublimity, by being accu&s;|tomed
to expand its faculties to the dimen&s;ions
of a large object: by u&s;e, it becomes &s;killful
in compounding uniformity with variety; in
mea&s;uring proportion; in tracing out de&s;ign;
<PB N="111" REF="115">
in judging of imitation; in blending hetero|geneous
qualities. This expertne&s;s gives
force and boldne&s;s to the &s;entiments produced,
and heightens the attendant con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
our own abilities.</P>
<P>OBJECTS impre&s;s us more or le&s;s, accor|ding
to the degree of <HI>attention,</HI> which we
be&s;tow upon them. Cu&s;tom enables us to
apply our minds more vigorou&s;ly to objects,
than we could at fir&s;t. It is not only difficult
to <HI>form</HI> a complete conception of new objects,
but when they excite neither &s;urprize nor
curio&s;ity, it is &s;ometimes even difficult to
<HI>attempt</HI> conceiving them, and to bring our|&s;eves
&s;teadily to contemplate them. Cu&s;tom
wears off this indi&s;po&s;ition; begets an apti|tude
and previous bia&s;s to the emotions, which
beauty and deformity in&s;pire; and thus ren|ders
us prone to their peculiar &s;entiments.
Works of ta&s;te fall in with the predominant
temper, and on that account ea&s;ily engage
the attention, affect deeply, and excite the
livelie&s;t perceptions. It is remarkable too,
from whatever cau&s;e it proceeds, that we &s;et
a high value on what we have been long ac|cu&s;tomed
to. A man of ta&s;te places the
plea&s;ures of imagination in a higher cla&s;s than
<PB N="112" REF="116">
other men are apt to do; he e&s;teems them
more noble and &s;ub&s;tantial: and the opinion
acquired by cu&s;tom, of their value and impor|tance
transfu&s;es it&s;elf into each gratification.</P>
<P>THE &s;entiments of ta&s;te depend very much
on <HI>a&s;&s;ociation.</HI> So far as they proceed from
this, <HI>cu om</HI> mu&s;t augment them, as cu&s;tom,
by adding a new principle of union, renders
the connection more intimate, and introduces
the related ideas more quickly and forcibly.
Cu&s;tom likewi&s;e begets new a&s;&s;ociations,
and enables works of ta&s;te to &s;ugge&s;t ideas,
which were not <HI>originally</HI> connected with
them: and what a &s;urprizing inten&s;ene&s;s,
the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, originally foreign, be|&s;tows
on our perceptions, both plea&s;urable
and painful, is obvious in too many in&s;tances
to require being enlarged on.</P>
<P>BY the concurrence of the&s;e cau&s;es, the
&s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te is even <HI>augmented,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
the tendency of habit to <HI>dimini&s;h</HI> it.
Its gratification or di&s;gu&s;t is often more ex|qui&s;ite,
than any of the emotions which at|tend
appetite and pa&s;&s;ion. It becomes &s;o
acute that the <HI>&s;malle&s;t</HI> beauties and blemi&s;hes
have force &s;ufficient to affect it. But tho'
<PB N="113" REF="117">
the vivacity of its perceptions &s;hould &s;ome|times
decay by repetition; yet cu&s;tom, pro|ducing
the other perfections of ta&s;te, gives a
refinement, elegance, and a&s;&s;urance to our
&s;entiments, which may compen&s;ate their <HI>vio|lence</HI>
at fir&s;t. <HI>Judgment</HI> may approve with
greate&s;t confidence and ju&s;tice, when <HI>fancy</HI>
is no longer enraptured and enthu&s;ia&s;tically
agitated.</P>
<P>SENSIBILITY of ta&s;te ari&s;es chiefly from
the &s;tructure of our internal &s;en&s;es, and is but
indirectly and remotely connected with the
&s;oundne&s;s or improvement of judgment.
The want of it is <HI>one</HI> ingredient in many
&s;orts of fal&s;e ta&s;te; but does not con&s;titute
&s;o much one &s;pecies of <HI>wrong</HI> ta&s;te, as a
total <HI>deficience</HI> or great <HI>weakne&s;s</HI> of ta&s;te.
Sen&s;ibility may &s;ometimes become <HI>exce&s;&s;ive;</HI>
and render us extravagant both in liking and
di&s;liking, in commending and blaming. But,
in truth, this extravagance proceeds much
le&s;s commonly from exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, than
from a defect in the other requi&s;ites of fine
ta&s;te; from an incapacity to di&s;tingui&s;h and
a&s;certain, with preci&s;ion, different degrees
of excellence or faultine&s;s. In&s;tead of for|ming
an adequate idea of the nature of the
<PB N="114" REF="118">
beauty or deformity, we go beyond all
bounds of moderation; and when we want
to expre&s;s our &s;entiments, can do it only in
general terms, tumid and exaggerated. If
we are di&s;plea&s;ed, we &s;ignify it, with the
inveteracy of a <HI>Dennis,</HI> in terms of general
invective; and, without explaining the cau&s;es
of our di&s;approbation, pronounce it poor,
dull, wretched, execrable. If we are plea&s;ed
we cannot tell, with what, how, or why;
but only declare it fine, incomparable, with
the unmeaning rapture of an ancient rhap&s;o|di&s;t,
who, without under&s;tanding the princi|ples
of art, or the &s;en&s;e of an author, like a
madman, really agitated by the fury which
the poets feigned, could recite or prai&s;e them
with &s;uch vehemence as tran&s;ported him&s;elf,
and a&s;toni&s;hed his auditors<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">From <HI>Plato's</HI> dialogue in&s;cribed <HI>Io,</HI> we learn that there were men of this character, who travelled through Greece and contended at the public fe&s;tivals.

It is probable that they al&s;o declaimed in prai&s;e of their favourite ver&s;es; this &s;eems to be implied in the ex|pre&s;&s;ions, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, and is in&s;inuated by the proof which <HI>Socrates</HI> produces of their ig|norance of art, from the capacity of every real arti&s;t to di&s;|tingui&s;h beauties from faults, and to point them out in the works of any performer in the kind. <HI>Socrates</HI> proves, from the conce&s;&s;ions of his antagoni&s;t, that neither did his &s;enti|ments proceed from true ta&s;te, from a vigorous perception of the beauties he recited, nor his encomiums from judgment, from a critical &s;kill in the principles of beauty. He therefore, in his u&s;ual &s;train of irony, re&s;olves both into an unaccountable agitation of &s;pirit, proceeding either from madne&s;s or from in|&s;piration; and with great humour compares the &s;everal mu&s;es to as many magnets. The mu&s;e in&s;pires the poet, without any agency or knowledge of his; he, in the &s;ame manner conveys the in&s;piration to his rhap&s;odi&s;t, and he to his atten|tive hearers; ju&s;t as the load&s;tone by, it's imperceptible and unaccountable influence, attracts a ring of iron, that a &s;econd, and that a third.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>REFINEMENT of ta&s;te exi&s;ts only, where,
to an original delicacy of imagination, and
natural acutene&s;s of judgment, is &s;uperadded
a long and intimate acquaintance with the

&s;hould be &s;tudied, but &s;uch as have real ex|cellence;
and tho&s;e are chiefly to be dwelt
upon, which di&s;play new beauties on every
review. The mo&s;t con&s;picuous virtues will
be at fir&s;t perceived. Farther application will
di&s;cover &s;uch as lie too deep to &s;trike a &s;uper|ficial

which, without &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would have
<PB N="127" REF="131">
long, perhaps always, remained undi&s;covered
by him. And repeated di&s;coveries of this
kind, made either by one's own &s;agacity, or
by the indication of others, beget in time an
habitual refinement, a capacity of making
&s;imilar ones, with facility and quickne&s;s.</P>
<P>WHERE refinement is wanting, ta&s;te mu&s;t
be coar&s;e and vulgar. It can take notice
only of the gro&s;&s;er beauties; and is di&s;gu&s;ted
only with the mo&s;t &s;hocking faults. The
thine&s;t di&s;gui&s;e, the lea&s;t depth is &s;ufficient
to elude its &s;crutiny. It is in&s;en&s;ible to the
delicacies of art and nature: they are too
fine, and make too &s;light an impre&s;&s;ion to be
ob&s;erved. As &s;avages can be touched with
nothing, but what excites the utmo&s;t extra|vagance
of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o a gro&s;s and barbarous
ta&s;te can reli&s;h nothing that is not either pal|pable
or overdone. Cha&s;te beauties it has
not acutene&s;s to perceive; complex ones it
has not force enough to comprehend. Look|ing
only to the &s;urface, it often approves
what is really faulty or defective, and is indif|ferent
to what po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the utmo&s;t elegance.
Its deci&s;ions are, of con&s;equence, di&s;propor|tioned
to the real merit of the objects: the
mo&s;t glaring, the lea&s;t artificial performances
<PB N="128" REF="132">
are &s;ure to gain the preference. It has been
often remarked, that a certain gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and
want of refinement in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ta&s;te, al|lows,
and even demands a boldne&s;s, a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s,
and indelicacy in their theatrical entertain|ments,
which would be intolerable to the ele|gant

<P>BUT, an exce&s;&s;ive or fal&s;e refinement, is
equally to be avoided<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">True ta&s;te is a proper medium betwixt the&s;e extremes. &ldquo;Ce di&s;cernement fait conno&icirc;tre les cho&s;es telles qu'elles &s;ont en elles-m&ecirc;mes, &s;ans qu'on demeure court, comme le peu|ple, qui s'arr&ecirc;te &agrave; la &s;uperfi$ie; ni au&s;&s;i &s;ans qu'on aille trop loin, comme$ces e&s;prits rafinez, qui a force de &s;ubtilizer s'e|vaporent en des imaginations vaines et chimeriques.&rdquo; <BIBL>En|tret. <HI>iv.</HI> d' Ari&s;t.</BIBL></NOTE>.

was &s;o intent on the contemplation of the

into fal&s;e elegance, and capricious nicety.

<P>CORRECTNESS of ta&s;te pre&s;erves us from

<P>EVERY excellence is a middle between
two extremes, one of which always bears

every ca&s;e pull off the ma&s;k, and certainly
di&s;tingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>CUSTOM enables us to form ideas with
exactne&s;s and preci&s;ion. By &s;tudying works
<PB N="139" REF="143">
of ta&s;te, we acquire clear and di&s;tinct concep|tions
of tho&s;e qualities, which render them
beautiful or deformed: we take in at one
glance all the e&s;&s;ential properties; and thus
e&s;tabli&s;h in the mind a criterion, a touch&s;tone
of excellence and depravity. Judgment al&s;o
becomes &s;kilful by exerci&s;e, in determining,
whether the object under con&s;ideration per|fectly
agrees with this mental &s;tandard.
While it is unaccu&s;tomed to a &s;ubject, it
may, through its own imbecillity, and for
want of clear ideas of the characters of the
kind, mi&s;take re&s;emblance for identity; or
at lea&s;t be unable to di&s;tingui&s;h them, with|out
laborious application of thought, frequent
trials, and great hazard of error. But when
u&s;e has rendered any &s;pecies of exertion fami|liar,
it ea&s;ily and infallibly di&s;criminates,
wherever there is the minute&s;t difference.
We grow &s;o well acquainted with every
form, and have ideas &s;o perfectly adequate,
that we are &s;ecure again&s;t mi&s;take, when &s;uf|ficient
attention is be&s;towed. The real qua|lities
of things are pre&s;ented to ta&s;te pure and
unmixed, in their genuine features and pro|portions,
and excite &s;entiments entirely con|gruous.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="144">
JUSTNESS of ta&s;te extends &s;till farther, than
to the di&s;tinction of counterfeit for real. We
can compare the &s;entiments produced, and
di&s;cover readily the different cla&s;&s;es, to which
they belong. We not only feel in general
<HI>that</HI> we are plea&s;ed, but perceive in <HI>what</HI>
particular manner; not only di&s;cern that
there is <HI>&s;ome</HI> merit, but al&s;o of what determi|nate
<HI>kind</HI> that merit is. Though all the &s;en|&s;ations
of ta&s;te are, in the highe&s;t degree,
analogous and &s;imilar; yet each has its pecu|liar
feeling, its &s;pecific form, by which one
who has a di&s;tinct idea of it, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es
exactne&s;s of judgment, may mark its diffe|rence
from the others. It is this which be|&s;tows
preci&s;ion and order on our &s;entiments.
Without it they would be a mere confu&s;ed
chaos: we &s;hould, like per&s;ons in a mi&s;t,
&s;ee &s;omething, but could not tell what we
&s;aw. Every good or bad quality, in the
works of art or genius would be a mere <HI>je ne
&s;&ccedil;ai quoy.</HI></P>
<P>As a correct ta&s;te di&s;tingui&s;hes the <HI>kinds,</HI> it
al&s;o mea&s;ures the <HI>degrees</HI> of excellence and
faultine&s;s. Every one is con&s;cious of the
degree of approbation or di&s;like, which he
<PB N="141" REF="145">
be&s;tows on objects. But &s;ometimes the ideas
we retain of the&s;e &s;en&s;ations are &s;o ob&s;cure,
or our comparing faculty is &s;o imperfect, that
we only know in general, that one gratifica|tion
is higher or more inten&s;e than another;
but cannot &s;ettle their <HI>proportion,</HI> nor even
perceive the <HI>exce&s;s,</HI> except it be con&s;iderable.
We are often better plea&s;ed at fir&s;t with &s;uper|ficial
glitter or gaudy beauty, which, having
no &s;olidity, become on examination in&s;ipid or
di&s;ta&s;teful, than with &s;ub&s;tantial merit, which
will &s;tand the te&s;t of reiterated &s;crutiny;
<Q><L>&mdash;quae, &s;i propius &s;tes,</L>
<L>Te capiet magis;&mdash;</L>
<L>Judicis argutum quae non formidat acumen;</L></Q>
But as the perceptions of an improved ta&s;te
are always adequate to the merit of the objects;
&s;o an accurate judgment is &s;en&s;ible, on com|pari&s;on,
of the lea&s;t diver&s;ity in the degree of
the plea&s;ure or pain produced. And if we
have a&s;certained tho&s;e qualities, which are
the cau&s;es of our &s;entiments, reflection on
the degrees of them, which things po&s;&s;e&s;s,
will help to regulate our deci&s;ion, and prevent
our being impo&s;ed upon by any ambiguity in
our feelings; giving us both an exacter &s;tan|dard,
<PB N="142" REF="146">
and an additional &s;ecurity again&s;t judg|ing
wrong.</P>
<P>THE accuracy of ta&s;te may become &s;o ex|qui&s;ite,
that it &s;hall not only di&s;criminate the
different kinds and degrees of gratification;
but al&s;o mark the lea&s;t varieties in the manner
of producing it. It is this accuracy, habitu|ally
applied to works of ta&s;te, that lays a
foundation for our di&s;covering the peculiar
character and manner of different ma&s;ters.
A capacity for this, as it implies the nice&s;t
exactne&s;s, is ju&s;tly a&s;&s;igned as an infallible
proof of real and well improved ta&s;te.</P>
<P>INCORRECTNESS of ta&s;te may ari&s;e, either
from the dullne&s;s of our internal <HI>&s;en&s;es,</HI> or
from the debility of <HI>judgment.</HI> The former
renders our &s;entiments ob&s;cure and ill-defined,
and therefore difficult to be compared. The
latter incapacitates us for perceiving the re|lations
even of the cleare&s;t perceptions, or
the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hable qualities. In either
ca&s;e, the mind is di&s;tracted with &s;u&s;pen&s;e
and doubt. This is an unea&s;y &s;tate, from
which we are de&s;irous to extricate our&s;elves,
by any means. If we have not vigour of
ta&s;te enough, to determine the merit of the
<PB N="143" REF="147">
object, by its intrin&s;ic characters, we take
up with any &s;tandard, however foreign or
improper, that can end our wavering. Au|thority
in all its forms u&s;urps the place of
truth and rea&s;on. The u&s;age of an admired
genius will procure approbation even to
<HI>faults,</HI> from one who&s;e ta&s;te is languid. He
is unable readily to detect them; and their
being committed by &s;o great a ma&s;ter, and
intermixed with many beauties, will keep
him from even &s;u&s;pecting that they can be
wrong; and con&s;equently prevent his &s;cru|tiny.
Like the &s;pots of the &s;un, which can|not
be di&s;covered by the naked eye, the
faults of an eminent genius require &s;omething
more to enable us to di&s;cern them, than the
elements of ta&s;te which nature be&s;tows: till
the&s;e are invigorated by culture, they will di&s;|appear
in the general &s;plendor. The <HI>genius</HI> of
<HI>Shake&s;pear</HI> may betray an unformed ta&s;te into
an approbation of the <HI>barbarities,</HI> which are
often mingled with his beauties. The wits
of king <HI>Charles's</HI> court are &s;aid to have allowed
<HI>Cowley</HI> an undi&s;tingui&s;hed admiration. One
may be too much plea&s;ed with <HI>Congreve's</HI>
wit, to remark its incongruity to the characters
to which it is a&s;cribed. The veneration we
have for antiquity, aided by the &s;how of
<PB N="144" REF="148">
learning, which acquaintance with it implies,
and by the malignant joy, which envy feels
in depreciating cotemporaries, often &s;tamps a
value on its productions, di&s;proportioned to
their intrin&s;ic merit:
<Q><L>&mdash;Et ni&s;i quoe terris &s;emota, &s;ui&s;que</L>
<L>Temporibus defuncta videt, fa&s;tidit et odit.</L></Q></P>
<P>The opinion and example of others often re|commends
to us, what is fa&s;hionable or new,
without our taking the pains to examine it.
And their opinion is often not founded on
judgment, but dictated by intere&s;t, friend&s;hip,
enmity, or party &s;pirit. Every period of
time has produced bubbles of artificial fame,
which are kept up a while by the breath of
fa&s;hion, and then break at once and are an|nihilated.
The learned often bewail the lo&s;s
of ancient writers, who&s;e characters have &s;ur|vived
their works; but, perhaps, if we
could retrieve them, we &s;hould find them
only the <HI>Granvilles, Montagues, Stepneys,</HI> and
<HI>Sheffields</HI> of their time, and wonder by what
infatuation or caprice they could be rai&s;ed to
notice<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">RAMBLER, No. 106.</NOTE>. Fal&s;e or imperfect rules, either
e&s;tabli&s;hed by our&s;elves, or implicitly re|ceived
from others, may corrupt or con&s;train
<PB N="145" REF="149">
our ta&s;te, and render our deci&s;ions unju&s;t.
Had critici&s;m in it's infancy fallen into the
hands of one, in judgment and penetration,
inferior to <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> a number of precarious
and unnatural rules might have long obtained
an undi&s;puted authority. A prevailing turn
and di&s;po&s;ition of mind often makes us una|ble
to reli&s;h any thing, but what falls in with
it, and thus perverts and prejudices our judg|ment.
Hence generally proceeds the depra|vity
of public ta&s;te, and the pernicious influ|ence
it has on public entertainments and dra|matic
works: and hence, in a great mea|&s;ure,
the connection of the ta&s;te of a people
with their morals.</P>
<P>THESE corruptions of ta&s;te can be avoided
only by e&s;tabli&s;hing within our&s;elves an exact
&s;tandard of intrin&s;ic excellence, by which we
may try whatever is pre&s;ented to us. It will
be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the careful &s;tudy of the mo&s;t
correct performances of every kind, which
are generally indeed the mo&s;t excellent. But
though they &s;hould only ri&s;e to mediocrity,
they are fitter for laying the foundation of
correctne&s;s, than &s;uch as are far &s;uperior on
the whole, but faulty in &s;ome particulars:
<PB N="146" REF="150">
for the greater the beauties, the readier are
the faults to debauch the ta&s;te. 'Till it is
formed, and has acquired con&s;iderable vigour,
it is dangerous to be much conver&s;ant with
tho&s;e productions, the virtues of which are
eminent, but blended with many faults. The
chief utility of critici&s;m lies in promoting cor|rectne&s;s
of ta&s;te. In the mo&s;t imperfect e&s;|&s;ays,
the authority of the critic will, at lea&s;t,
excite our attention, and provoke our enqui|ry.
But every one who really merits the
name conveys much more momentous in&s;truc|tion,
and more effectually teaches ju&s;tne&s;s of
thinking, by explaining the kind and degree
of every excellence and blemi&s;h, by teaching
us what are the qualities in things, to which
we owe our plea&s;ure or di&s;gu&s;t, and what the
principles of human nature, by which they
are produced.</P>
<P>CARE however mu&s;t be taken to pre&s;erve
our ta&s;te unconfined though exact, to avoid
that &s;crupulous formality, often &s;ub&s;tituted
for true correctne&s;s, which will allow no de|viation
from e&s;tabli&s;hed rules. To di&s;approve
a tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of a general law, when the
&s;pirit is ob&s;erved, and when the end is, per|haps
more effectually, promoted, is not <HI>ju&s;t|ne&s;s,</HI>
<PB N="147" REF="151">
but <HI>&s;ervility</HI> and narrowne&s;s of ta&s;te.
Who will di&s;like the land&s;capes of <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI>
though he has di&s;regarded correctne&s;s of draw|ing
in his animals? <HI>Parmegiano</HI> is &s;aid by
good judges to owe the inexpre&s;&s;ible greatne&s;s
of manner in his pictures, to the neglect of
ju&s;t proportion in &s;ome of the members of his
figures. A contracted ta&s;te is chiefly inci|dent
to tho&s;e, who would &s;upply the want
of natural talents, by the drudgery of appli|cation.
But in every thing, the finical is e&s;|&s;entially
different from the neat, the exact
from the preci&s;e, the regular from the

<P>THE la&s;t fini&s;hing and complete im|provement

regular adju&s;tment of all it's &s;entiments, ac|cording
to their genuine value; &s;o that none

us in&s;en&s;ible to the re&s;t. This is ju&s;tne&s;s and
correctne&s;s, not confined to the parts of ob|jects,
but extended to the whole. Ta&s;te is
not one &s;imple power; but an aggregate of
many, which, by the re&s;emblance of their
energies, and the analogy of their &s;ubjects,
and cau&s;es, readily a&s;&s;ociate and are combi|ned.
But every combination of them will
not produce a perfect ta&s;te. In all compo&s;i|tions,

<P>The want of due proportion is one of the
mo&s;t fertile cau&s;es of fal&s;e ta&s;te; and one of
the mo&s;t common &s;ources of that variety of
forms and modifications, which true ta&s;te
a&s;&s;umes in different per&s;ons. Every one has
a predominant turn of genius and ta&s;te, by
which his reli&s;h is more adapted to &s;ome one
&s;pecies of excellence, than to others. This
is inevitable on account of the diver&s;ities in|cident
to men, in the natural bent of their
<PB N="151" REF="155">
temper and pa&s;&s;ions; which always renders
them peculiarly acce&s;&s;ible to &s;ome kinds of gra|tification
or di&s;gu&s;t. According as the &s;ublime
or the humble pa&s;&s;ions, the grave or the lively,
are predominant in the &s;tructure of the &s;oul, our
reli&s;h will be keene&s;t for the grand or the ele|gant,
the &s;erious or the ludicrous. In this man|ner,
the nece&s;&s;ary imperfection of human na|ture
prevents our ever being able to e&s;tabli&s;h a
proportion and oeconomy of our internal &s;en|&s;es,
nicely accurate in every re&s;pect. A &s;mall
di&s;proportion is not cen&s;ured, becau&s;e it is
natural: but when it exceeds certain bounds,
it is acknowleged to degenerate into a partial
and di&s;torted form. This di&s;tortion is not,
however, &s;o much owing to the original ex|ce&s;s
of one principle as to other cau&s;es. <HI>That</HI>
lays the foundation of it; but <HI>the&s;e</HI> augment
the natural inequality, and render it more
ob&s;ervable. The principal of the&s;e cau&s;es is
a narrowne&s;s of mind, by rea&s;on of which,
we cannot comprehend many perceptions at
once, without confu&s;ion, nor trace out their
relations, and a&s;certain their re&s;pective mo|ment,
without di&s;traction and perplexity.
We fix upon a part, we are engro&s;&s;ed by the
&s;eparate &s;entiment, which it excites, we are
blind to the nature of the other parts, or,
<PB N="152" REF="156">
at lea&s;t, cannot extend our thoughts &s;o far,
as to combine them all into one conception.
A due proportion of the principles of ta&s;te
pre&s;uppo&s;es the correctne&s;s of each, and in|cludes,
additional to it, an enlargement and
comprehen&s;ion of mind.</P>
<P>THAT it may be acquired, all the internal
&s;en&s;es mu&s;t be equally exerci&s;ed. If, by
accidental di&s;u&s;e or perver&s;ion, any of them
has fallen below it's proper tone, it mu&s;t, by
particular attention, be again wound up to it.
Habitual exerci&s;e promotes an harmonious
&s;ubordination of the principles of ta&s;te, by
producing a large compa&s;s of thought. It
renders Ideas and &s;en&s;ations &s;o determinate
and familiar, that the large&s;t collections of
them find room to lie di&s;tinctly expo&s;ed to
the mental eye; and at the &s;ame time
&s;trengthens judgment to &s;uch a pitch, that
it can view with ea&s;e the mo&s;t complicated
&s;ubjects, and decide with accuracy concerning
them. 'Till this enlargement and exten&s;ive
amplitude of ta&s;te is once acquired, our de|terminations
mu&s;t be e&s;&s;entially defective.
Every art has a whole for it's object: the
contrivance, di&s;po&s;ition, and expre&s;&s;ion of
this is it's main requi&s;ite: the merit of the
<PB N="153" REF="157">
parts ari&s;es, not &s;o much from their &s;eparate
elegance and fini&s;hing, as from their relations
to the &s;ubject: and therefore, no true judg|ment
can be formed, even of a part, without
a capacity of comprehending the whole at
once, and e&s;timating all its various qualities.</P>
<P>THOUGH plea&s;ure and pain are counter|parts
in ta&s;te, our &s;en&s;e of them may be di&s;|proportioned
and unequal. If unea&s;y and
gloomy pa&s;&s;ions preponderate in the con&s;ti|tution,
and form the prevailing temper, they
produce a &s;uperior pronene&s;s to &s;entiments
of di&s;approbation and di&s;like. The chear|ful
and plea&s;urable affections, on the other
hand, diffu&s;e a tincture over all our powers,
which makes us much more &s;u&s;ceptible of
admiration, than of its oppo&s;ite. This ine|quality
is frequently de&s;tructive of true ta&s;te.
A perfect and faultle&s;s performance is not
to be expected in any art. Our gratification
mu&s;t in every ca&s;e be ballanced again&s;t di&s;|gu&s;t;
beauties again&s;t blemi&s;hes; before we
have compared aud mea&s;ured them, we can
form no judgment of the work. For want
of the quickne&s;s and compa&s;s of thought,
requi&s;ite for this, or of inclination to employ
<PB N="154" REF="158">
it, we often err in our deci&s;ions. Excel|lencies
and faults are &s;ometimes united in
the &s;ame part. A member may be &s;o ele|gantly
fini&s;hed, as to gain the applau&s;e of
the un&s;killful; but &s;o un&s;uitable to its place,
&s;o prejudicial to the unity and effect of the
whole, as to de&s;erve the &s;evere&s;t cen&s;ure
But in every performance, beauties and ble|mi&s;hes
are to be found in different parts. A
contracted mind fixes on one or the other.
It is related of <HI>Apollodorus,</HI> an ancient paint|er,
that he de&s;troyed his fine&s;t pictures, if he
could di&s;cover in them any, even the minute&s;t
fault. Some critics, as if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the
&s;ame frantic &s;pirit, will condemn a thou&s;and
beauties of the highe&s;t rank, on account of a
few intermingled faults, which bear no
proportion to them, and do not perhaps at
all affect the whole. On the contrary, the
merit of a &s;ingle part will &s;trike a more can|did
judge &s;o &s;trongly, as to make him over|look
multitudes of faults, which infinitely
overballance it.</P>
<P>BUT a per&s;on of true ta&s;te forms his judg|ment
only from the &s;urplus of merit, after an
accurate compari&s;on of the perfections and
<PB N="155" REF="159">
the faults. And indeed the greate&s;t critics<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">This &s;ubject is profe&s;&s;edly examined by <HI>Longinus,</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>
allow the chief merit, not to the greater
<HI>number,</HI> but to the higher <HI>rank</HI> of beauties;
not to that <HI>preci&s;ion</HI> and con&s;tant atention to
every trifle, which produces a cold and lan|guid
mediocrity, but to that noble <HI>boldne&s;s</HI> of
genius, which ri&s;es to the height of excel|lence,
with a kind of &s;upernatural ardor, that
makes it negligent with regard to numberle&s;s
<HI>minutiae;</HI> in fine, not to that <HI>faultle&s;s</HI> in&s;i|pidity,
which e&s;capes our blame, but to that
daring <HI>exaltation,</HI> which, however &s;haded by
inaccuracies, or even deba&s;ed by the mixture
of gro&s;s tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, forces our admiration.
<HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> has been ju&s;tly preferred to <HI>Hy|perides,
Archilochus</HI> to <HI>Erato&s;thenes,</HI> and <HI>Pin|dar</HI>
to <HI>Bacchylides.</HI> A man &s;hould ju&s;tly
expo&s;e him&s;elf to a &s;u&s;picion of bad ta&s;te,
who approved a faultle&s;s, unintere&s;ting tra|gedy,
more than <HI>Othello</HI> or King <HI>Lear;</HI> or
who gave <HI>Waller</HI> greater applau&s;e than <HI>Dry|den.
Titian</HI> has been blamed for incorrect|ne&s;s
of de&s;ign; but he will ever hold a rank
among painters, far &s;uperior to <HI>Andrea del

another, and in &s;ome mea&s;ure produce the

<P>IT has been ob&s;erved above, that tho&s;e
internal &s;en&s;es, from which ta&s;te is form|ed,
are commonly referred to the <HI>imagina|tion;</HI>
which is con&s;idered as holding a mid|dle
rank between the bodily &s;en&s;es, and the
rational and moral faculties.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned that the vulgar divi|&s;ions
of our faculties are generally &s;uperfi|cial
and inaccurate. Our mental operations,
though of all things the mo&s;t intimately pre|&s;ent
to us, are of &s;uch a &s;ubtle and tran&s;itory
nature, that, when they are reflected on, they
in a great mea&s;ure elude our view, and their
limits and di&s;tinctions appear involved in ob|&s;curity
and confu&s;ion. The common di&s;tri|bution
of our mo&s;t obvious powers, our ex|ternal
<PB N="160" REF="163">
&s;en&s;es, is acknowledged to be faulty:
much more may we expect inaccuracy in
the ordinary methods of cla&s;&s;ing &s;uch as are
le&s;s generally attended to. All divi&s;ions of
our derived and compounded powers mu&s;t
be liable to error, till the &s;imple qualities,
from which they proceed, have been inve&s;|tigated.</P>
<P>IT &s;ometimes happens, notwith&s;tanding,
that, by a kind of natural anticipation, we
&s;trike out ju&s;ter divi&s;ions, than could have
been expected, without reflection on the real
foundation of them. This holds in the pre|&s;ent
ca&s;e. If we will but recollect and com|pare
tho&s;e qualities of human nature, from
which ta&s;te has been explained, we &s;hall be
convinced, that all its phaenomena proceed,
either from the general laws of <HI>&s;en&s;ation,</HI> or
from certain operations of the <HI>imagination.</HI>
Ta&s;te therefore, though it&s;elf a &s;pecies of
&s;en&s;ation, is, in re&s;pect of its principles, ju&s;tly
reduced to imagination.</P>
<P>THAT ta&s;te is properly a kind of &s;en&s;a|tion,
can &s;carce be called in que&s;tion, by any
one who has clear and di&s;tinct ideas. It
&s;upplies us with &s;imple perceptions, intirely
<PB N="161" REF="164">
different from all that we receive by exter|nal
&s;en&s;e or by reflection. The&s;e make us
acquainted with the forms and inherent qua|lities
of things external, and with the nature
of our own powers and operations: but
ta&s;te exhibits a &s;et of perceptions, which,
though con&s;equent on the&s;e, are really dif|ferent;
which re&s;ult from, but are not in|cluded
in, the primary and direct perception
of objects. They are however equally un|compounded
in their feeling, as incapable of
being conceived prior to experience, as im|mediately,
nece&s;&s;arily, and regularly exhibit|ed
in certain circum&s;tances, as any other
&s;en&s;ation what&s;oever<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Indeed as our external &s;en&s;es are <HI>ultimate</HI> and <HI>original</HI> principles, it may perhaps be taken for granted that this cir|cum&s;tance is e&s;&s;ential to the idea of a &s;en&s;e, and that no power of the mind can be properly expre&s;&s;ed by this name, which is derived and compounded, and capable of being re|&s;olved into &s;impler principles. According to this hypothe&s;is, the powers of ta&s;te would not be &s;en&s;es. To enquire whe|ther they are or are not, may perhaps be deemed a di&s;pute about words, as the determination will depend upon the defi|nition of a &s;en&s;e. It is however of &s;ome real moment, that the powers of the mind be reduced into cla&s;&s;es, according to their real differences and analogies; and therefore, that no definition be received, which would di&s;turb the regular di&s;|tribution of them. And that the powers of ta&s;te may with the greate&s;t propriety be reckoned &s;en&s;es, though they be de|rived faculties, will, it is hoped, appear from the following ob&s;ervations. We are directed by the <HI>phaenomena</HI> of our fa|culties, in reducing them to cla&s;&s;es. The obvious phaenome|na of a <HI>&s;en&s;e</HI> are the&s;e. It is a power, which &s;upplies us with &s;uch <HI>&s;imple</HI> perceptions, as cannot be conveyed by any other channel to tho&s;e who are de&s;titute of that &s;en&s;e. It is a power which receives its perception <HI>immediately,</HI> as &s;oon as its object is exhibited, previous to any rea&s;on concerning the qualities of the object, or the cau&s;es of the perceptions. It is a power which exerts it&s;elf <HI>independent of volition,</HI> &s;o that, while we remain in proper circum&s;tances, we cannot, by any act of the will, prevent our receiving certain &s;en&s;ations, nor alter them at plea&s;ure, nor can we, by any means, procure the&s;e &s;en&s;ations, as long as we are not in the proper &s;ituation for receiving them by their peculiar organ. The&s;e are the circum&s;tances which characterize a &s;en&s;e. Sight, for in&s;tance, conveys &s;imple perceptions, which a blind man cannot po&s;&s;i|bly receive. A man who opens his eyes at noon immediate|ly perceives light; no efforts of the will can prevent his per|ceiving it, while his eyes are open; and no volition could make him perceive it at midnight. The&s;e characters evi|dently belong to all the external &s;en&s;es, and to reflexion or con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s, by which we perceive what pa&s;&s;es in our minds. They likewi&s;e belong to the powers of ta&s;te; harmony, for example, is a &s;imple perception, which no man who has not a mu&s;ical ear can receive, and which every one who has an ear immediately and nece&s;&s;arily receives on hearing a good tune. The powers of ta&s;te are therefore to be reckoned &s;en|&s;es. Whether they are ultimate powers, is a &s;ub&s;equent que&s;|tion. Tho&s;e who are unacquainted with philo&s;ophy reckon all our powers ultimate qualities of the mind. But nature de|lights in &s;implicity, and produces numerous effects, by a few cau&s;es of exten&s;ive influence; and it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of phi|lo&s;ophy to inve&s;tigate the&s;e cau&s;es, and to explain the phaeno|mena from them. On enquiry it appears that the internal &s;en&s;es are not ultimate principles, becau&s;e all their phaenomena can be accounted for, by &s;impler qualities of the mind. Thus, the plea&s;ure we receive from beautiful forms is re&s;olvible into the plea&s;ure of facility and that of moderate exertion. But, notwith&s;tanding this di&s;covery of the cau&s;es of our reflex &s;en|&s;ations, we may continue to term them &s;en&s;es, &s;ince it does not contradict any of the phaenomena, on account of which this name was originally be&s;towed upon them. Beautiful forms have uniformity, variety, and proportion; but the plea&s;ure they give us an immediate &s;en&s;ation, prior to our analy&s;ing them, or di&s;covering by rea&s;on that they have the&s;e qualities. We find, on examination, that uniformity and pro|portion are agreeable. As they enable us to conceive the object with facility and variety; as it hinders this facility from degenerating into languor; and thence we conclude, that the plea&s;ant &s;entiment of beauty is the re&s;ult of tho&s;e &s;im|ple principles which di&s;po&s;e us to reli&s;h moderate facility, and moderate difficulty; but the &s;entiment of beauty ari&s;es, with|out our reflecting on this mixture. This &s;entiment is com|pound in its <HI>principles,</HI> but perfectly &s;imple in its <HI>feeling.</HI> If this &s;hould &s;eem to imply a contradiction, let it be remem|bered that two liquors of different flavours may, by their mix|ture, produce a third flavour, which &s;hall excite in the palate a &s;en&s;ation as &s;imple, as that which it receives from any of the ingredients. In like manner, the perception of white|ne&s;s is as &s;imple as that of any colour; but philo&s;ophers know that, in re&s;pect of its cau&s;e, it is compounded of the &s;even primary colours. Lord <HI>Verulam</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Nov. Org.</HI> lib. ii. aph. 26.</NOTE>. concludes from &s;ome experiments that the external &s;en&s;e of ta&s;te is compounded of &s;mell and touch. Suppo&s;e this conclu&s;ion ju&s;t, ta&s;te would be a derived power; but &s;till it would be a di&s;tinct &s;en&s;e, as its perceptions are peculiar, and &s;pecifically different in their feeling both from odours and tangible qualities. Ju&s;t &s;o each principle of ta&s;te is with rea&s;on accounted a particular &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e its perceptions, however produced, are peculiar to it, and &s;pecifically different from all others. Each conveys perceptions, which, in re&s;pect of their feeling, are original, though the powers, by which they are conveyed, are derived. It is &s;carce nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that our a&s;cribing the &s;enti|ments of ta&s;te to mental proce&s;&s;es is totally different from a&s;|&s;erting that they are deductions of rea&s;on. We do not prove that certain objects are grand by arguments, but we perceive them to be grand, in con&s;equence of the natural con&s;titution of our mind, which di&s;po&s;es us, without reflection, to be plea&s;ed with largene&s;s and &s;implicity. Rea&s;oning may, however, be employed in exhibiting an object to the mind, and yet the perception that it has, when the object is once exhibited, may properly belong to a &s;en&s;e. Thus rea|&s;oning may be nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain the circum&s;tances, and de|termine the motive, of an action; but it is the moral &s;en&s;e that perceives it to be either virtuous or vicious, after rea&s;on has di&s;covered its motive and its circum&s;tances.</NOTE> Ta&s;te is &s;ubject|ed

to the &s;ame general laws, which regulate
our other &s;en&s;es. To trace out all the&s;e
<PB N="163" REF="166">

mention but one law of &s;en&s;ation, which has

been &s;o often hinted at already, and which,
by its immediate effects and remoter con&s;e|quences,
has &s;o great influence on the &s;enti|ments
of ta&s;te, that it will be proper in a few
words to illu&s;trate it. When an object is pre&s;en|ted
to any of our &s;en&s;es, the mind conforms it
&s;elf to its nature and appearance, feels an
emotion, and is put in a frame &s;uitable and
analogous; of which we have a perception
<PB N="165" REF="168">
by con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or reflection. Thus diffi|culty
produces a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a grateful
exertion of energy: facility of an even and
regular flow of &s;pirits: excellence, perfect|ion,
or &s;ublimity, begets an enlargement of
mind and con&s;cious pride; deficience or im|perfection,
a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;oul, and painful
humility. This adapting of the mind to
its pre&s;ent object is the <HI>immediate</HI> cau&s;e of
many of the plea&s;ures and pains of ta&s;te;
and, by its <HI>con&s;equences,</HI> it augments or dimi|ni&s;hes
many others. Though the actions of
the mind &s;ucceed one another with &s;urpri&s;ing
quickne&s;s, they are not in&s;tantaneous: it re|quires
&s;ome time to pa&s;s from one di&s;po&s;ition
or employment to another. Every frame of
mind has a kind of firmne&s;s, tenacity, or ob|&s;tinacy,
which renders it aver&s;e to quit it's
hold. Every &s;en&s;ation or emotion, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, re&s;i&s;ts diminution or extinction. We
find it difficult to di&s;mi&s;s at once any object,
which has engro&s;&s;ed our thoughts, and to turn
in an in&s;tant to another<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Difficile e&s;t mutare habitum animi &s;emel con&s;titutum. <BIBL>QUINT. <HI>In&s;t&punc; Orat.</HI> lib. iv. cap. 2.</BIBL></NOTE>. Even after an
object is removed, the frame it produced, the
<HI>impetus</HI> it gave the mind, continues, and ur|ges
us to go on in the &s;ame direction: it re|quires
time and labour to de&s;troy it. If the
<PB N="166" REF="169">
&s;ucceeding object demand a different confor|mation
of mind, our application to it mu&s;t,
on this account, be le&s;s vigorous, and its im|pre&s;&s;ion
fainter. But if it be analagous to
the preceding, it finds the &s;uitable di&s;po&s;ition
already rai&s;ed, and therefore &s;trikes the &s;en&s;e
with all its force. Hence the mighty effi|cacy,
which perceptions acquire, in poetry
or eloquence, by being introduced in a pro|per
order, and with due preparation. Hence
the influence of an habitual and prevailing
temper or turn of mind, in enlivening con|gruous
perceptions, and in debilitating &s;uch
as are incongruous. As far as the &s;entiments
of ta&s;te depend on the&s;e principles, &s;o far
they ari&s;e immediately from the general laws
of &s;en&s;ation.</P>
<P>WE can explain our external &s;en&s;es no
otherwi&s;e, than by marking their differen|ces,
reducing them to cla&s;&s;es, and delineating
the laws of exertion common to all, or pecu|liar
to each. They are original qualities of
human nature, not re&s;olvible into any others,
more ultimate and &s;imple; but ta&s;te, in mo&s;t
of its forms, at lea&s;t, is a derivative and &s;e|condary
power. We can trace it up to &s;im|pler
principles, by pointing out the mental
proce&s;s that produces it, or enumerating the
<PB N="167" REF="170">
qualities, by the combination of which it is
formed. The&s;e are found, on examination,
to be no other than certain exertions of <HI>ima|gination.</HI>
That this may become more ob|vious,
we &s;hall briefly a&s;certain the nature
and extent of fancy, by exhibiting a detail of
its principal operations, as far as they con|cern
the pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION is fir&s;t of all employed in
pre&s;enting &s;uch ideas, as are not attended
with <HI>remembrance,</HI> or a perception of their
having been formerly in the mind. This de|fect
of remembrance, as it prevents our re|ferring
them to their original &s;en&s;ations, di&s;|&s;olves
their natural connection. But when
<HI>memory</HI> has lo&s;t their real bonds of union,
<HI>fancy,</HI> by its a&s;&s;ociating power, confers upon
them new ties, that they may not lie perfectly
loo&s;e, ranges them in an endle&s;s variety
of forms. Many of the&s;e being repre&s;enta|tions
of nothing that exi&s;ts in nature, what|ever
is fictitious or chimerical is acknowledged
to be the offspring of this faculty, and is
termed imaginary. But wild and lawle&s;s as
this faculty appears to be, it commonly ob|&s;erves
certain general rules, a&s;&s;ociating chiefly
ideas which <HI>re&s;emble,</HI> or are <HI>contrary,</HI> or tho&s;e
<PB N="168" REF="171">
that are conjoined, either merely by <HI>cu&s;tom,</HI>
or by the connection of their objects in <HI>vici|nity,
coexi&s;tence,</HI> or <HI>cau&s;ation.</HI> It &s;ometimes
<HI>pre&s;umes</HI> that ideas have the&s;e relations, when
they have them not; but it generally di&s;covers
them, where they are; and by this means
becomes the cau&s;e of many of our mo&s;t im|portant
operations<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">For in&s;tance, &s;ome ideas are of &s;uch a nature, that, whenever they occur, they impel to action. It is by making &s;uch ideas frequently occur, by con&s;tantly &s;ugge&s;ting them, that repetition produces the cu&s;tomary tendency, and habi|tual pronene&s;s to an action, which is an e&s;&s;ential part in every active habit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEREVER fancy &s;uppo&s;es, or perceives in
ideas any of the uniting qualities ju&s;t now
mentioned, it readily, and with a kind of ea|gerne&s;s,
pa&s;&s;es from one idea to its a&s;&s;ociates;
it be&s;tows &s;uch a connection on them, that
they become almo&s;t in&s;eparable, and generally
appear together. Their union is &s;o &s;trong,
the tran&s;ition from one to the other is &s;o ea&s;y,
that the mind takes in a long train of related
ideas with no more labour than is requi&s;ite for
viewing a &s;ingle perception; and runs over
the whole &s;eries with &s;uch quickne&s;s, as to
be &s;carce &s;en&s;ible that it is &s;hifting its objects.
On this account, when a number of di&s;tinct
<PB N="169" REF="172">
ideas are firmly and intimately connected, it
even combines them into a whole, and con&s;i|ders
them as all together compo&s;ing one percep|tion.
This is the origin of all our complex per|ceptions.
It is fancy which thus be&s;tows unity
on number, and unites things into one image,
which in them&s;elves, and in their appearance
to the &s;en&s;es, are di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. All
the objects that affect ta&s;te, and excite its
&s;entiments, are certain forms or pictures made
by fancy, certain parts or qualities of things,
which it combines into complex modes.</P>
<P>IDEAS, which are thus compounded, or
which are even, without compo&s;ition, only
a&s;&s;ociated, communicate, by the clo&s;ene&s;s
of their relation, their qualities to one ano|ther.
The di&s;po&s;ition with which the mind
contemplated the fir&s;t, by its own firmne&s;s,
which makes force requi&s;ite to de&s;troy or
change it, and by the &s;trength of the union,
which keeps this force from being applied,
continues while we view the others. And
we imagine, by a kind of illu&s;ion, that they
produced the di&s;po&s;ition, which in reality was
brought to the perception of them; and we
a&s;cribe to them the qualities which are nece&s;|&s;ary
for its production. A perception, by
<PB N="170" REF="173">
being connected with another, that is &s;trong,
plea&s;ant, or painful, becomes it&s;elf vigorous,
agreeable or di&s;agreeable. Hence may be
deduced the force of <HI>&s;ympathy,</HI> which enlivens
our <HI>ideas</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ions infu&s;ed by it to &s;uch
a pitch, as in a manner converts them into
the pa&s;&s;ions them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IF indeed the connected ideas have &s;uch a
degree of relation, as unavoidably leads us to
compare them, the phaenomenon will be re|ver&s;ed,
the effect of the <HI>compari&s;on</HI> overbal|lancing
that of the <HI>a&s;&s;ociation.</HI> An idea will
appear weaker, le&s;s plea&s;ant, or le&s;s painful
than it really is, by being introduced by one
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a greater degree of the&s;e qua|lities,
if it is at the &s;ame time compared
with it.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION &s;ometimes operates &s;o
&s;trongly, as not only to a&s;&s;ociate, or even
combine, but al&s;o to confound together ideas
or &s;en&s;ations that are related, and to mi&s;take
one for the other. This is the cau&s;e of our
often a&s;cribing the plea&s;ure or the pain, which
re&s;ults merely from our own operations, to
the objects about which they happen to be
employed; and of our confounding together
<PB N="171" REF="174">
objects, or ideas, which are contemplated
with the &s;ame or a like di&s;po&s;ition. It is
likewi&s;e the &s;ource of many figures, in which
one thing is u&s;ed for another, as metaphor,
denomination, abu&s;ion, and the like.</P>
<P>IMAGINATION does not confine it&s;elf to
its own weak ideas; but often acts in con|junction
with our &s;en&s;es, and &s;preads its in|fluence
on their impre&s;&s;ions. Sen&s;ations,
emotions, and affections are, by its power,
a&s;&s;ociated with others, readily introducing
&s;uch as re&s;emble them, either in their feeling
or direction. Nay, they are capable of a
clo&s;er union, than even our ideas; for they
may not only, like them, be <HI>conjoined,</HI> but
al&s;o <HI>mixed</HI> and blended &s;o perfectly together,
that none of them &s;hall be di&s;tinctly perceiv|able
in the compound, which ari&s;es from
their union.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e are operations of imagination,
which naturally proceed from its &s;imple&s;t
exertions, and are the principles, from which
the &s;entiments of ta&s;te ari&s;e. The&s;e &s;enti|ments
are not fanta&s;tical, imaginary, or un|&s;ub&s;tantial;
but are univer&s;ally produced by
the energies of fancy, which are indeed of
<PB N="172" REF="175">
the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and have the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive influence on the operations of the
mind. By being compounded with one an|other,
or with other original qualities of hu|man
nature, they generate mo&s;t of our com|pounded
powers. In particular, they pro|duce
<HI>affection,</HI> and <HI>ta&s;te</HI> of every kind; the
former, by operating in conjunction with
tho&s;e qualities of the mind, which fit us for
action; the latter, by being combined with
the general laws of &s;en&s;ation.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the connexion of ta&s;te with genius.</HEAD>
<P>TASTE may be con&s;idered either as an
e&s;&s;ential <HI>Part,</HI> or as a nece&s;&s;ary <HI>atten|dant</HI>
of genius; according as we con&s;ider ge|nius
in a more or le&s;s exten&s;ive manner. Every
one aknowledges that they have a very near
connexion. It is &s;o evident, that it has almo&s;t
pa&s;t into a maxim, that the able&s;t performers
are al&s;o the be&s;t judges in every art. How
far the maxim is ju&s;t will be&s;t appear, by
briefly determining the nature and principles
of genius.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and leading quality of genius is
<HI>invention,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ts in an exten&s;ive
comprehen&s;ivene&s;s of imagination, in a rea|dine&s;s
of a&s;&s;ociating the remote&s;t ideas, that
are any way related. In a man of genius
the uniting principles are &s;o vigorous and
quick, that whenever any idea is pre&s;ent to
the mind, they bring into view at once all
others, that have the lea&s;t connection with
it. As the magnet &s;elects from a quantity
of matter the ferruginous particles, which hap|pen
<PB N="174" REF="177">
to be &s;cattered through it, without
making an impre&s;&s;ion on other &s;ub&s;tances;
&s;o imagination, by a &s;imilar &s;ympathy, equally
inexplicable, draws out from the whole com|pa&s;s
of nature &s;uch ideas as we have occa&s;ion
for, without attending to any others; and yet
pre&s;ents them with as great propriety, as if
all po&s;&s;ible conceptions had been explicitly
expo&s;ed to our view, and &s;ubjected to our
choice.</P>
<P>AT fir&s;t the&s;e Materials may lie in a rude
and indige&s;ted chaos: but when we attentive|ly
review them, the &s;ame a&s;&s;ociating power,
which formerly made us &s;en&s;ible of their
connection, leads us to perceive the different
degrees of that connection; by it's magical force
ranges them into different &s;pecies, according
to the&s;e degrees; di&s;po&s;es the mo&s;t &s;trongly
related into the &s;ame member; and &s;ets all
the members in that po&s;ition, which it points
out as the mo&s;t natural. Thus from a con|fu&s;ed
heap of materials, collected by fancy,
genius, after repeated reviews and tran&s;po&s;i|tions,
de&s;igns a regular and well proportioned
whole<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">This operation of genius, in de&s;igning it's productions, is de&s;cribed with all the beauties of poetical expre&s;&s;ion, in <HI>The plea&s;ures of imagination,</HI> <BIBL>B. iii. ver. 348&ndash;410.</BIBL></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">
THIS brightne&s;s and force of imagination
throws a lu&s;tre on it's effects, which will
for ever di&s;tingui&s;h them from the lifele&s;s
and in&s;ipid productions of inanimated indu&s;|try.
Diligence and acquired abilities may
a&s;&s;i&s;t or improve genius; but a fine imagina|tion
alone can produce it. Hence is derived
it's inventive power in all the &s;ubjects to which
it can be applied. This is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in com|mon
by the mu&s;ician, the painter, the poet,
the orator, the philo&s;opher, and even the
mathematician. In each indeed, it's form
has &s;omething peculiar, ari&s;ing either from
the degree of extent and comprehen&s;ion of
fancy; or from the peculiar prevalence of
&s;ome one of the a&s;&s;ociating qualities; or
from the mind being, by original con&s;titu|tion,
education, example, or &s;tudy, more
&s;trongly turned to one kind than the others.</P>
<P>A GENIUS for the fine arts implies, not
only the power of invention or de&s;ign, but
likewi&s;e a capacity to expre&s;s it's de&s;igns in
apt materials. Without this, it would not
only be imperfect, but would for ever lie
latent, undi&s;covered, and u&s;ele&s;s. It is chief|ly
the peculiar modification of this capacity,
which adapts a genius to one art rather than
<PB N="176" REF="179">
another. To form a painter, the ideas a&s;|&s;embled
by fancy mu&s;t give him a view of
their corre&s;pondent objects, in &s;uch order and
proportion, as will enable him to exhibit the
original to the eye, by an imitation of it's
figure and colour. To form a poet, they
mu&s;t lead the thoughts, not to the corporeal
forms of things, but to the &s;igns, with which
by the common u&s;e of language, they are
connected; &s;o that he may employ them
with propriety, force, and harmony, in ex|citing
&s;trong ideas of his &s;ubject.</P>
<P>CULTURE may &s;trengthen invention;
knowledge is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;upplying a fund
from which it may collect it's materials; but
improvement chiefly affects the capacity of
expre&s;&s;ion. Painting requires a mechanical
&s;kill, produced by exerci&s;e: mu&s;ic a know|ledge
of the power of &s;ounds, derived from
experience: poetry and eloquence an acquain|tance
with all the force of words and in&s;titu|ted
&s;igns, an advantage which can be obtain|ed
only by careful &s;tudy.</P>
<P>THUS genius is the grand architect, which
not only choo&s;es the materials, but di&s;po&s;es
them into a regular &s;tructure. But it is not
able to fini&s;h it by it&s;elf. It needs the a&s;&s;i&s;|tance
<PB N="177" REF="180">
of ta&s;te, to guide and moderate it's ex|ertions.
Though the different relations of
the parts, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, determine the
form and po&s;ition of each, we acquire much
ampler a&s;&s;urance of it's rectitude, when ta&s;te
has reviewed and examined both the de&s;ign
and execution. It &s;erves as a check on mere
fancy; it interpo&s;es it's judgment, either ap|proving
or condemning; and rejects many
things, which una&s;&s;i&s;ted genius would have
allowed.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tinct provinces of genius and ta&s;te
being thus marked out, it will be ea&s;y to di&s;|cover
how far they are connected. They
mu&s;t be connected in a con&s;iderable degree,
&s;ince they both &s;pring from imagination: but
as it is differently exerted in each, their con|nection
will not be perfectly accurate and
uniform.</P>
<P>GENIUS is not always attended with ta&s;te
preci&s;ely equal and proportioned. It is &s;ome|times
incorrect, though copious and exten&s;ive.
It is &s;ometimes bold, yet can transfu&s;e no de|licacy
or grace into it's productions. But it
is never &s;ound where ta&s;te is altogether wan|ting.
The &s;ame vigour of the a&s;&s;ociating
principles, which renders genius quick and
<PB N="178" REF="181">
comprehen&s;ive, mu&s;t be&s;tow &s;uch &s;trength on
the &s;everal dependent operations of fancy,
which generate ta&s;te, as &s;hall make that fa|culty

by critics, are deduced from their practice,

<P>BUT ta&s;te often prevails where genius is
wanting; they may judge, who cannot them|&s;elves
perform. The operations, that depend
on the imagination, may be vigorous enough
to form a high reli&s;h, though it be de&s;titute
of that brightne&s;s and exten&s;ion, which is
nece&s;&s;ary for a comprehen&s;ive genius. The
a&s;&s;ociating principles may be &s;trong and ac|tive

be narrow. And &s;oundne&s;s and &s;trength of

IT mu&s;t however be acknowleged, that
genius will always throw a peculiar brightne&s;s

contagion, to catch the &s;pirit of an author,
to judge with the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition, in which

The common defect, with which they are charged, is, that their ob&s;ervations are too ge|neral. This is undoubtedly the ca&s;e, as critici&s;m has been, generally, managed: and the rea&s;on is, that it has been &s;el|dom cultivated by a regular and ju&s;t induction. It was long ago ob&s;erved by Lord <HI>Verulam,</HI> that there are two kinds of in|duction, one imperfect and in&s;ufficient, which leads us at once from experiments, to the mo&s;t general conclu&s;ions; the other legitimate and perfect, but &s;carce ever u&s;ed, which ri&s;es gra|dually from le&s;s general, to more general principles. &ldquo;Duae viae &s;unt, atque e&s;&s;e po&s;&s;unt, ad inquirendam et inveniendam veritatem.

Indeed in what|ver regards &s;entiment, there is a peculiar temptation to pur|&s;ue this cour&s;e. For the very feelings excited by qualities that belong to different <HI>genera,</HI> being &s;en&s;ibly di&s;tinct, direct men, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to di&s;tingui&s;h them, though not with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion. But it requires attention and acutene&s;s to mark the le&s;&s;er varieties of &s;entiment, which corre&s;pond to the &s;pecies of each. The matter of fact objected only &s;hews, therefore, that critici&s;m has been cultivated by a wrong method of induction. The con&s;equence has been, that even tho&s;e general di&s;tinctions, which appear to be a&s;certained, are loo&s;e uncertain, and ill defined; a defect that can never be reme|died, till the other &s;ort of induction is applied, and critics be content to ri&s;e from particular principles, gradually, to &s;uch as are more general. Thus only can our conceptions of all the &s;entiments of ta&s;te, and of the qualities by which they are excited, be rendered accurate and determinate.</NOTE>.</P>

To complete the critici&s;m, and render it
truly philo&s;ophical, the common qualities of
the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es, both &s;uperior and &s;ubordi|nate,
mu&s;t be compared with the principles

<P>ALL this is included in perfect critici&s;m,

<P>IT has been often ob&s;erved that nature is
the &s;tandard and archetype of all true rules of

converted into a &s;tanding law, and applied to
ca&s;es no ways &s;imilar: arbitrary re&s;traints
have been impo&s;ed without nece&s;&s;ity, and
even &s;hining faults have been recommended

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the objects of ta&s;te.</HEAD>
<P>WE have &s;een the importance of ta&s;te,
both to the performer, and the
judge. But its proper office and exten&s;ive
influence will perhaps appear &s;till farther,
by con&s;idering its objects in a &s;omewhat dif|ferent
light. It may be conceived as em|ploying
it&s;elf about <HI>nature, art,</HI> and <HI>&s;cience.</HI>
With regard to nature, which is the com|mon
&s;ubject of the other two, ta&s;te and rea|&s;on
are employed in conjunction. In art,
ta&s;te is the ultimate judge, and rea&s;on but its
mini&s;ter. In &s;cience, rea&s;on is &s;upreme,
but may &s;ometimes reap advantage, from
u&s;ing ta&s;te as an auxiliary.</P>
<P>AS rea&s;on inve&s;tigates the <HI>laws</HI> of nature,
ta&s;te alone di&s;covers its <HI>beauties.</HI> It fills us
with admiration of the &s;tupendous magnitude
of the mundane &s;y&s;tem. It is charmed with
the regularity, order, and proportion, which
every part of it di&s;plays, even to the mo&s;t il|literate;
with the beauty and variety of co|lours,
<PB N="188" REF="191">
which tinge the face of nature; with
the fitne&s;s and utility of all its productions;
with the inexhau&s;tible diver&s;ity, and endle&s;s
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects, which it pre&s;ents
to view. Flowers di&s;clo&s;e a thou&s;and deli|cate
or vivid hues. Animals appear in come|ly
&s;ymmetry. Here the ocean &s;preads forth
it's &s;mooth and boundle&s;s &s;urface; there the
earth forms a verdant carpet. Mountains
ri&s;e with rugged maje&s;ty; the valleys wear
a plea&s;ant bloom; and even the dreary wil|derne&s;s
is not de&s;titute of augu&s;t &s;implicity.
The day is u&s;hered in by a &s;plendid lumina|ry,
who&s;e beams expo&s;e to view the beauties
of the world, and gild the face of nature.
And when the curtain of night veils terre&s;|trial
objects from our eye, the wide expan&s;e
appears &s;pangled with &s;tars, and opens the
pro&s;pect of multitudes of worlds pa&s;t rec|koning.
Spring, &s;ummer, autumn, pre&s;ent
us with natural beauties, in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
periods of their growth; and even &s;tern
winter leaves many objects unde&s;troyed, from
which a vigorous ta&s;te may extract no incon|&s;iderable
degree of entertainment.</P>
<P>SCARCE any art is &s;o mean, &s;o entirely
mechanical, as not to afford &s;ubjects of ta&s;te.
<PB N="189" REF="192">
Dre&s;s, furnitnre, equipage will betray a good
or bad ta&s;te: nay the lowe&s;t uten&s;il may be
beautiful or ugly in the kind<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">In how great a degree the beauty of the&s;e meaner &s;ub|jects is regulated by the &s;ame principles, from which that of the nobler &s;prings, appears in many in&s;tances, produced by Mr. <HI>Hogarth,</HI> in his <HI>Analy&s;is of beauty.</HI>.</NOTE> But the
finer arts, which imitate the excellencies of
nature, &s;upply it with more proper materials;
and thence derive their merit. Mu&s;ic, paint|ing,
&s;tatuary, architecture, poetry, and elo|quence,
con&s;titute it's peculiar and dome&s;tic
territory, in which it's authority is ab&s;olutely
&s;upreme. In this department, genius receives
it's decrees with implicit &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and
rea&s;on is but it's mini&s;ter, employed to bring
into view, and reduce into form, the &s;ubjects
of which it is to judge.</P>
<P>THE &s;ciences are &s;u&s;ceptible, not only of
truth or fal&s;ehood; but al&s;o of beauty or
deformity, excellence or defect. As the for|mer
are primarily regarded, rea&s;on, by which
they are di&s;tingui&s;hed, here reigns &s;upreme,
and is the immediate and proper judge of
merit. Ta&s;te exerci&s;es only a &s;ubordinate
juri&s;diction, and mu&s;t be employed in &s;ub&s;er|vience
to under&s;tanding. When this &s;ub|ordination
<PB N="190" REF="193">
is perverted, and ta&s;te is principal|ly
regarded, fal&s;e and erroneous theories are
introduced. Imagination is &s;ub&s;tituted for
rea&s;on; prejudice &s;upplies the place of evi|dence;
plau&s;ible fables are embraced in&s;tead
of &s;olid truths. An immoderate attachment
to novelty or antiquity, to &s;ublimity or &s;im|plicity,
has often in &s;cience given ri&s;e to whim|&s;ical
principles, and di&s;torted explications of
the phaenomena of things. To one or other
of the&s;e cau&s;es, we may a&s;cribe mo&s;t of the
&s;y&s;tems of fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, that have ever
prevailed in the world.</P>
<P>BUT ta&s;te, when under the entire controul
of rea&s;on, and u&s;ed only as it's a&s;&s;i&s;tant, is
highly u&s;eful in &s;cience. It judges, not only
of the manner in which &s;cience is communi|cated,
but al&s;o of the &s;ubject matter it&s;elf.
Every ju&s;t conclu&s;ion, by extending our know|ledge
of nature, di&s;covers &s;ome new beauty
in the con&s;titution of things, and &s;upplies ad|ditional
gratification to ta&s;te. The plea&s;ure,
which attends the perceptions of this faculty,
&s;trongly prompts us to exert rea&s;on in philo|&s;ophical
enquiries, and, with unremitted a&s;&s;i|duity,
to explore the &s;ecrets of nature
that we may obtain that plea&s;ure. By
it's approbation, it confirms the deductions
<PB N="191" REF="194">
of rea&s;on, and, by making us feel the <HI>beauty,</HI>
heightens our conviction of the <HI>truth</HI>
of it's conclu&s;ions. The <HI>Newtonean</HI> theory
is not more &s;atisfying to the under|&s;tanding,
by the ju&s;t rea&s;onings on which
it is founded, than agreeable to ta&s;te, by it's
&s;implicity and elegance. As the operations
of ta&s;te are quick, and almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous,
it is &s;ometimes di&s;gu&s;ted with the bungling
appearance of principles, and leads us to &s;u&s;|pect
them, before rea&s;on has had time to di&s;|cover
where the fal&s;ehood lies. A king of
<HI>Spain,</HI> who had made con&s;iderable progre&s;s
in a&s;tronomy, is &s;aid to have been highly
di&s;gu&s;ted with the confu&s;ion and perplexity,
in which the <HI>Ptolemaic</HI> &s;y&s;tem involves the
motions of the cele&s;tial bodies. His <HI>rea&s;on</HI>
&s;ubmitted to that hypothe&s;is; but his <HI>ta&s;te</HI>
di&s;liked it. In&s;tead of cen&s;uring the con&s;ti|tution
of nature, he &s;hould have &s;u&s;pected
the explication, which repre&s;ented it as
irregular, and ill contrived. When the mun|dane
&s;y&s;tem is ju&s;tly explained, it appears to
be adju&s;ted with the nice&s;t regularity and
proportion; the &s;en&s;e of which at once con|firms
the theory, and fills us with admiration

<P>THE ob&s;ervations we have made concer|ning
the &s;ubjects of ta&s;te not only a&s;|certain
it's genuine province, but likewi&s;e, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, evince it's exten&s;ive utility and
importance. It will not however be impro|per
to complete our view of it's advantages,
by con&s;idering it's effects, both immediate and
remote.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>immediate</HI> &s;ource of plea&s;ures, not
only innocent, but elegant and noble. The
powers of imagination are a &s;triking in&s;tance
of the munificence of our creator, who has
furni&s;hed us not only with tho&s;e faculties,
which are nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of our
being, but &s;uch al&s;o as may fit us for recei|ving
a rich variety of enjoyment. And by the
improvement of the&s;e powers, our plea&s;ures
may be &s;till farther multiplied, and rendered
more exqui&s;ite. A fine ta&s;te qualifies a man
for enjoyments, to which others are perfect
&s;trangers, and enables him to derive enter|tainment
from almo&s;t every thing in art or
nature. It enlarges his &s;phere of happine&s;s,
<PB N="193" REF="196">
by yielding delights, which employ the mind
without fatiguing it, and gratify without
cloying.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ures of ta&s;te, though le&s;s im|proving
than &s;uch as are intellectual, are often
as great, generally more rapturous, always
more univer&s;ally attainable. We need but
attend, and they are infu&s;ed by every object,
without labour or expence of thought. The
beauties of nature are open to all: and tho'
few can have the <HI>property,</HI> mo&s;t men may
have the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of many of the wonders
of art. The improvement of ta&s;te is ea&s;ier,
and more certain, than that of rea&s;on. Some
are indeed incapable of the highe&s;t perfection
of it: But few are &s;o entirely de&s;titute of the
natural &s;eeds of it, as not to receive &s;ome
plea&s;ure from it's proper objects. Though
all cannot attain &s;uch <HI>ju&s;tne&s;s</HI> of di&s;cernment,
as may qualify them for being judges, or
gain them authority as critics; there are
&s;carce any, who may not acquire the <HI>&s;en&s;ibi|lity,</HI>
that is requi&s;ite for their own gratifi|cation.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ures of ta&s;te are not like the gra|tifications
of external &s;en&s;e, followed by un|ea&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="194" REF="197">
or &s;atiety; nor reflected upon with
di&s;&s;atisfaction. They are confe&s;&s;edly of an
higher order. A reli&s;h for them adds digni|ty
to a character, and commands no incon&s;i|derable
degree of approbation. A man, who
devotes a con&s;iderable part of his time to the
gratification of &s;en&s;e, is an object of contempt
or indignation: but a per&s;on who can fill up
tho&s;e parts of life, that afford no opportunities
for &s;ocial offices, with plea&s;ures of ta&s;te, who
can find entertainment for many hours in a
gallery of pictures, or in a collection of poems,
is e&s;teemed on this very account. Ju&s;tne&s;s
of ta&s;te procures an author as high a degree
of reputation, as the mo&s;t curious ab&s;tract
di&s;qui&s;itions. <HI>Ari&s;totle's</HI> critical works are
more generally valued than his logic. To the
later he owed the veneration of his implicit
followers; a veneration which free enquiry
has already extingui&s;hed: but on account
of the former, all ages will probably admire
him.</P>
<P>THE &s;entiments of ta&s;te &s;pread a lu&s;tre over
mo&s;t of our enjoyments. The plea&s;ures of
&s;en&s;e and the external decorations of life
would be in&s;ipid and de&s;picable to every man
of under&s;tanding, if ideas of elegance and
<PB N="195" REF="198">
magnificence, derived from ta&s;te, were not
a&s;&s;ociated with them. Ta&s;te &s;tamps a value
upon riches, as the procuring it's gratifications
is the great end, for which they are de&s;ired,

<P>THE more remote advantages of ta&s;te
ari&s;e from the influence it has on the
pa&s;&s;ions and the character.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions, as well as ta&s;te, depend for
their production on the <HI>imagination;</HI> and
may therefore rea&s;onably be expected to bear
&s;ome analogy to it. Were it proper to enter
on a full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the origin of the pa&s;|&s;ions,
it might be &s;hown, not only that they
derive their exi&s;tence, their particular turn,
and their various degrees of &s;trength, from
the operations of fancy, but al&s;o that they
owe them, in many in&s;tances, to the very
&s;ame operations of fancy, which produce the
&s;entiments of ta&s;te. Fancy forms the pic|tures
which affect ta&s;te, by compounding &s;e|veral
di&s;tant ideas into one whole; and the&s;e
&s;ame pictures excite the pa&s;&s;ions. <HI>A&s;&s;ocia|tion</HI>
has a very great influence on ta&s;te; and
every philo&s;opher, who has examined the
<PB N="197" REF="200">
affections with tolerable care, has remarked
the great dependence which they have on
a&s;&s;ociation. Many of them ari&s;e from <HI>&s;ym|pathy;</HI>
and this principle is likewi&s;e the
&s;ource of many &s;entiments of ta&s;te. Both
our &s;entiments and our affections are often
rendered more inten&s;e by the mixture of con|comitant
emotions. A &s;trong imagination
produces a vigorous and lively ta&s;te; and
it is always attended with keen and ardent
pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THUS ta&s;te and affection are effects of the
&s;ame cau&s;e, &s;treams i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame
fountain; and mu&s;t therefore be in a con&s;i|derable
mea&s;ure &s;imilar, They likewi&s;e mu|tually
influence one another, and hence de|rive
a farther &s;imilarity. We have remark|ed
already, that the prevailing pa&s;&s;ion often
enlivens the &s;en&s;ations of ta&s;te, and deter|mines
it's particular form. Ta&s;te as often aug|ments
the vigour of the pa&s;&s;ions, and fixes
their prevailing character. Pre&s;ent a mere
ab&s;tract idea of good or evil; the mind feels
no emotion. Mention a particular advantage
or di&s;advantage; de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, joy or
&s;orrow is immediately arrou&s;ed. Tell us that
a man is generous, benevolent, or compa&s;|&s;ionate,
<PB N="198" REF="201">
or on the contrary that he is &s;ordid
&s;elfi&s;h, or hardhearted; this general account
of his character is too indefinite to excite ei|ther
love or hatred. Rehear&s;e a &s;eries of ac|tions,
in which the&s;e characters have been
di&s;played; immediately the &s;tory draws out
the affections corre&s;pondent. It is only a per|ception
enlivened by fancy, that affects our
active powers. A very general idea is &s;o un|&s;table,
that fancy cannot lay hold of it: but
when a particular idea is pre&s;ented, the ima|gination
dwells upon it, cloaths it with a va|riety
of circum&s;tances, runs from it to other
ideas, that are connected with it, and fini&s;hes
a picture of the object repre&s;ented by that
idea, which will infallibly produce a &s;uitable
affection. Now if we examine the colours,
which imagination throws upon our ideas,
in order to enable them to excite the pa&s;|&s;ions,
we &s;hall find that the greate&s;t part of
them are extracted from the &s;entiments of
ta&s;te. Honours have a great influence on
mo&s;t men; but greate&s;t on tho&s;e, who&s;e ta&s;te
is of &s;uch a &s;tructure, as to give them a high
reli&s;h of the magnificence and pomp, which
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of honours naturally procures.
There is &s;carce any quality, that recommends
a per&s;on more &s;trongly to our friend&s;hip,
<PB N="199" REF="202">
than a fitne&s;s for gratifying our ta&s;te in &s;ome
way or another. A genius for mu&s;ic or
painting will &s;ometimes more &s;peedily and
certainly introduce a &s;tranger to the notice
or good offices of a man, who is a tolerable
judge in the&s;e arts, than more important ac|compli&s;hments,
of which he is not equally
qualified to judge. A &s;en&s;e of beauty has gene|rally
much greater influence upon the amo|rous
pa&s;&s;ion, than the mere appetite for &s;en|&s;ual
plea&s;ure; and is &s;ometimes &s;o powerful,
as even to overbalance, in our choice, the na|tural
approbation of agreeable mental quali|ties.
An elegant entertainment is prepared,
not to &s;atisfy hunger, but to plea&s;e ta&s;te. We
may perhaps venture to a&s;&s;ert, that every ap|petite
and pa&s;&s;ion in our nature, except ava|rice
alone, or the love of money for the &s;ake
of hoarding, derives it's origin and it's vigour,
in a great mea&s;ure, from tho&s;e ideas, which
imagination borrows from ta&s;te, and a&s;&s;o|ciates
with the object of that pa&s;&s;ion. This
being the ca&s;e, the pa&s;&s;ions will naturally re|ceive
one tincture or other, in every man,
according to the particular con&s;titution of his
ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203">
WE find by experience &s;uch a connection
between the ta&s;tes and the pa&s;&s;ions of men,
as the&s;e ob&s;ervations would lead us to expect.
Great &s;en&s;ibility of ta&s;te is generally accom|panied
with lively pa&s;&s;ions. Women have
always been con&s;idered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing both in
a more eminent degree than men. Quick|ne&s;s
of ta&s;te is e&s;&s;ential to poetic genius; and
<HI>Horace</HI> has a&s;&s;igned to poets the corre&s;pon|dent
turn of pa&s;&s;ion, when he characteri&s;es
them <HI>genus irritabile.</HI> A gro&s;s, uncultivated
ta&s;te produces a gro&s;&s;ne&s;s and indelicacy of
pa&s;&s;ion, But wherever a delicate ta&s;te pre|vails,
it be&s;tows a certain refinement and ele|gance
on our principles of action, which
makes us de&s;pi&s;e many objects as gro&s;s and
coar&s;e, which vulgar minds pur&s;ue with ar|dour:
and even when we are attached to the
very &s;ame things with other men, it gives a
peculiar politene&s;s to our manner of affecting
them. Savages have a gro&s;sne&s;s both of ta&s;te
and of pa&s;&s;ion, which di&s;tingui&s;hes them from
civilized nations. The vulgar in every na|tion
are di&s;tingui&s;hed, by the &s;ame circum|&s;tance,
from the polite. Whatever quality
gives a tincture to the ta&s;te of a nation, is
found to tinge al&s;o the national character.
<PB N="201" REF="204">
The <HI>French</HI> have a peculiar delicacy of ta&s;te:
and a peculiar vivacity and elegance runs
through their manners. The irregularity and
boldne&s;s of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ta&s;te corre&s;ponds ex|actly
with the general &s;pirit of the nation.
The &s;tateline&s;s, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> affect
in their behaviour, is analagous to the lofti|ne&s;s
which they approve in compo&s;ition. It
is no difficult matter to trace a like connec|tion
between ta&s;te and character in indivi|duals.</P>
<P>THIS connection may be owing, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, to the influence, which the pa&s;&s;ions
have on ta&s;te. But it can &s;carce be doubted,
that it ari&s;es as frequently from the tincture,
which ta&s;te gives to the pa&s;&s;ions: e&s;pecially
when we recollect that the ideas which ex|cite
the pa&s;&s;ions are, in a great mea&s;ure, de|rived
from the &s;entiments of ta&s;te.</P>
<P>IF it &s;hould farther appear, that a ju&s;t and
well regulated ta&s;te has a peculiar tendency
to confirm virtuous affections and principles,
it's importance would be &s;till more con&s;pi|cuous.
Tho&s;e who have enquired, whether
it has this tendency, &s;eem to have run into
extremes. Some repre&s;ent the&s;e qualities in
<PB N="202" REF="205">
actions and affections, which excite our mo|ral
approbation, as the &s;ame with tho&s;e qua|lities,
which, in a picture or a poem, produce
the gratification of ta&s;te; and think that it
is the &s;ame faculty, which is plea&s;ed in both
ca&s;es<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">This is often a&s;&s;erted, or very directly in&s;inuated, by Lord SHAFTESBURY. See <HI>Characteri&s;tics,</HI> pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. But experience will &s;carce &s;up|port
this opinion. A ta&s;te for the fine arts,
and a high &s;en&s;e of virtue, which, on this
hypothe&s;is, would be the &s;ame, are often &s;e|parated:
and a careful examination of the
moral faculty, would probably lead us to de|rive
it from other principles, than tho&s;e from
which ta&s;te has been explained. There
&s;eems however to be as little rea&s;on for de|termining
with others, that ta&s;te has no in|fluence
upon morality<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">This opinion is maintained by Mr. BROWN, <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Characteri&s;tics,</HI> &sect; 7.</NOTE>. It may be &s;epa|rated
from virtue; it may accidentally lead
men to act viciou&s;ly, for it's gratification: but
that it is naturally more favourable to virtue
than to vice, may be inferred from many of
the acknowledged qualities of the human
mind.</P>
<P>MOST wrong pa&s;&s;ions may be traced up
to &s;ome perver&s;ion of ta&s;te, which produces
<PB N="203" REF="206">
them, by leading us to mi&s;apprehend their
objects. It would be almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to
undertake a formal proof, that luxury, prodi|gality,
ambition, ari&s;e chiefly from this
cau&s;e. And it is evident, that, if ta&s;te were
perfectly formed, &s;o as to di&s;cover that it is
a fal&s;e beauty or &s;ublimity, or at lea&s;t an in|ferior
&s;pecies, that belongs to the&s;e vices or
their objects; and if it were accu&s;tomed to
the purer and nobler &s;ubjects about which
it may be employed, tho&s;e ideas, which now
mi&s;lead &s;o many, mu&s;t lo&s;e a great influence
upon them, Vice is often promoted by ta&s;te
ill formed or wrong applied: let ta&s;te be
rendered correct and ju&s;t, vice will be almo&s;t
extingui&s;hed; for our opinions of things will
be, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, true and &s;uited to their
natures.</P>
<P>A MAN who is acquainted with high and
noble plea&s;ures naturally de&s;pi&s;es &s;uch as are
far inferior. A reli&s;h for the gratifications of
ta&s;te will enable a man, in &s;ome degree, to
undervalue the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, and to di&s;|regard
the calls of appetite, which are the
greate&s;t ob&s;tructions to the prevalence of
good affections. A man of an improved ta&s;te
puts very little value on &s;en&s;ual delights, ex|cept
<PB N="204" REF="207">
&s;o far as they come to him, recommend|ed
by an opinion of elegance. And it has
been already ob&s;erved that a perfectly ju&s;t
ta&s;te would enable him to &s;trip this recom|mendation
in a great mea&s;ure of it's force.</P>
<P>ANY &s;entiment or affection which is &s;uita|ble
to the prevailing bia&s;s of the mind, will
derive peculiar &s;trength from that bia&s;s. A
ju&s;t and elegant ta&s;te, frequently employed
puts the mind into an habitual di&s;po&s;ition,
more congruous to the agreeable feeling, and
gentle impul&s;es of kind affection, than to the
more tumultuous agitations of the rougher
pa&s;&s;ions. The exerci&s;e of ta&s;te begets &s;ereni|ty,
and &s;atisfaction. When the&s;e prevail,
the mind is prone to benevolence. This af|fection
finds the mind already in a temper
&s;uited to it; and it &s;trikes deep it's roots, as
in a &s;oil, which &s;upplies it with it's natural
nouri&s;hment, in great abundance. A man is
&s;eldom better di&s;po&s;ed to friend&s;hip, generofi|ty,
love, and the whole train of kind affections,
than when his mind has been &s;oftened, by
the charms of mu&s;ic, painting, or poetry.
It is univer&s;ally acknowledged, that the&s;e arts,
when properly applied, are very powerful in
recommending virtue. And their power
<PB N="205" REF="208">
ari&s;es, in a great mea&s;ure, from the circum|&s;tance
which we are now con&s;idering. Their
immediate gratifications, by producing a con|gruous
di&s;po&s;ition, prepare the mind for being
deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the moral &s;entiments
and affections, which they are fitted to in|&s;inuate.</P>
<P>ALL the principles of the human mind
have &s;o near a connection, that one of them
can &s;carce be con&s;iderably altered, but it pro|duces
a &s;imilar alteration in the re&s;t. A vi|gorous
ta&s;te, not only is affected with every
the minute&s;t object, directly pre&s;ented to it;
but imparts al&s;o a peculiar &s;en&s;ibility to all
the other powers of the &s;oul. Refinement
of ta&s;te makes a man &s;u&s;ceptible of delicate
feelings on every occa&s;ion; and the&s;e increa&s;e
the acutene&s;s of the moral &s;en&s;e, and render
all it's perceptions &s;tronger and more exqui|&s;ite.
On this account a man of nice ta&s;te
will have a &s;tronger abhorrence of vice, and
a keener reli&s;h for virtue, in any given &s;itu|ation,
than a per&s;on of dull organs can have,
in the &s;ame circum&s;tances. Hence it proceeds
in part that many actions are reckoned either
virtuous or vicious by civilized nations, which
to &s;avages appear perfectly indifferent. This
<PB N="206" REF="209">
may rather be a&s;cribed to an elegance of ta&s;te
gradually introduced by &s;ociety, than to any
peculiar di&s;po&s;ition to virtue. The moral
&s;en&s;e is, in &s;avages, &s;o dull that the qualities
of the&s;e actions are imperceptible to them,
and their &s;entiments in other in&s;tances are
weak in proportion. Civilized nations have
delicacy &s;ufficient to perceive moral qualities
in actions, which make no impre&s;&s;ion on a
&s;avage; and this delicacy renders more vigo|rous,
in proportion, the perceptions which
they have from tho&s;e actions that are approved
or di&s;approved by &s;avages them&s;elves. Thus
the cultivation of ta&s;te gives new force to the
&s;entiments of the moral faculty, and by this
means renders it more powerful to repre&s;s the
vicious pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;upport the virtuous.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved that, though
ta&s;te and the moral &s;en&s;e are di&s;tinct powers,
yet many actions and affections are fit to gra|tify
both. What is virtuous and obligatory
is often al&s;o beautiful or &s;ublime. What is
vicious may be at the &s;ame time mean, de|formed,
or ridiculous. A man, who&s;e ta&s;te
is uncultivated, has no motive in the&s;e ca&s;es,
but what ari&s;es from the moral principle. A
per&s;on of improved ta&s;te, not only has this
<PB N="207" REF="210">
in it's greate&s;t &s;trength, but is capable of ad|ditional
motives derived from ta&s;te; and, hav|ing
thus a double impul&s;e, mu&s;t be more
&s;trongly prompted than the other. It mu&s;t
be acknowledged indeed that &s;ome vices ap|pear
&s;ublime or elegant, and may therefore
be recommended by ta&s;te. But they always
have the&s;e qualities in a le&s;s degree than the
oppo&s;ite virtues. Superiority to external
things is nobler than ambition. Admiration
of the&s;e vices therefore implies a defect of ju&s;t
ta&s;te. Where this faculty is perfect, it always
prefers virtue to vice.</P>
<P>IN order to give the foregoing ob&s;ervations
their full weight, it is nece&s;&s;ary to remember
that many different cau&s;es concur in forming
the characters of men. Ta&s;te is but one of
the&s;e cau&s;es; and not one of the mo&s;t power|ful.
It is not therefore to be expected that
the character &s;hould be, in every in&s;tance,
perfectly analogous to the ta&s;te. Other cau&s;es
may counteract the influence of this principle
and render the turn of the pa&s;&s;ions di&s;&s;imilar
to it's &s;tructure. On this account, examples
of a good ta&s;te joined with gro&s;s pa&s;&s;ions or a
vicious character are far from being &s;ufficient
to prove that ta&s;te has no connection with
<PB N="208" REF="211">
morals. This heterogeneous compo&s;ition
may be otherwi&s;e accounted for. All our
conclu&s;ions concerning human nature mu&s;t
be founded on experience: but it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary
that every conclu&s;ion &s;hould be <HI>imme|diately</HI>
deduced from experiment. A conclu|&s;ion
is often &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed, if it be
&s;hewn that it nece&s;&s;arily re&s;ults from general
qualities of the human mind, which have
been a&s;certained by experiment and induction.
This is the natural method of e&s;tabli&s;hing
&s;ynthetical conclu&s;ions; e&s;pecially where an
effect is produced by a complication of cau&s;es.
This is the ca&s;e in the &s;ubject of our pre&s;ent
enquiry. The character and the pa&s;&s;ions are
affected by many different cau&s;es; of which
ta&s;te is one. Ta&s;te in the fine arts may ap|pear
to be wanting in &s;ome men, becau&s;e
they have had no opportunities of exerci&s;ing
it on &s;ubjects of that kind; while, at the &s;ame
time, the natural principles of it being vigo|rous,
and all men being conver&s;ant about the
objects of affection, it may be&s;tow a delicacy
and refinement on the character. Affectation
may di&s;gui&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions; imitation may ren|der
them un&s;uitable to the turn of ta&s;te; ha|bit
may make them run counter to it: but
ta&s;te has, notwith&s;tanding, a natural tenden|cy
to influence them.</P>

<P>THE following e&s;&s;ays, upon the &s;ame &s;ub|ject
which Profe&s;&s;or <HI>GERRARD</HI> has treated
in &s;uch a ma&s;terly manner, are the productions
of three of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t elegant writers,
that the <HI>French</HI> nation has ever produced.
There can then be no doubt about their title
to a place in this volume, which, by &s;uch a va|luable
addition, will contain, perhaps, all that
can be &s;aid concerning the principles, the nature,
the characters and extent, the ri&s;e and decline
of true <HI>ta&s;te;</HI> matters hitherto injudiciou&s;ly
treated by many pens, and but &s;uperficially by
the be&s;t. But notwith&s;tanding the merit of
the&s;e e&s;&s;ays, it is owing to Mr. <HI>GERRARD'S</HI>
candid and generous permi&s;&s;ion, that they are
admitted into a volume which was appropriated
to his own excellent performance. The genuine
love of truth di&s;pells tho&s;e anxious fears of ri|vality,
which are the re&s;ult of a narrow and
&s;elfi&s;h ambition, and not of a noble and generous
emulation. Be&s;ides, Mr. <HI>GERRARD'S</HI> talents
render &s;uch anxious fears entirely groundle&s;s.
<PB N="212" REF="214">
On the other hand, our ingenious profe&s;&s;or

down to po&s;terity in company with tho&s;e of
<HI>MONTESQUIEU, D'ALEMBERT,</HI> and <HI>VOL|TAIRE.</HI></P>
<P>The e&s;&s;ays of the two latter are fini&s;hed
pieces. That of the late pre&s;ident <HI>MONTES|QUIEU</HI>
is an imperfect fragment, an a&s;&s;em|blage
of &s;cattered thoughts, the fir&s;t &s;trokes of
his pencil, in which we &s;ee the noble &s;ubject
&s;ketched out in part, and the principal colours
that enter into the compo&s;ition of true <HI>ta&s;te</HI>
thrown carele&s;ly upon the canva&s;s. For while
the noble arti&s;t was drawing his outlines, and
gathering materials for his work, he was
&s;eized with a di&s;order, which prevented him
from giving it the fini&s;hing touch, and depri|ved
the republick of letters of one of it's bright|e&s;t

an original genius, unconnected as they may be,
will be highly acceptable to &s;uch as know that
there is a true &s;ublime always to be found in
the fir&s;t and mo&s;t imperfect &s;ketches of great

<P>THE external &s;en&s;e, with which nature
has furni&s;hed us, and by which we
di&s;tingui&s;h and reli&s;h the various kinds of
nouri&s;hment, that are adapted to health and
plea&s;ure, has in all languages given occa&s;ion
to the metaphorical word <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> by which we
expre&s;s our perception of beauty, deformity,
or defect in the &s;everal arts. <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> then,
in general, is a quick di&s;cernment, a &s;udden
perception, which, like the &s;en&s;ation of the
palate, anticipates reflexion; like the palate,
it reli&s;hes what is good with an exqui&s;ite and
<PB N="214" REF="216">
voluptuous &s;en&s;ibility, and rejects the contrary
with loathing and di&s;gu&s;t; like the palate
al&s;o, it is often doubtful, and, as it were, be|wildered,
not knowing whether it &s;hould
reli&s;h or reject certain objects, and frequent|ly
requires the influence of habit to give it a
fixed and uniform determination.</P>
<P>TO have a <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es &s;omething more
than merely to perceive, and to di&s;cern with
accuracy the beauty of any work or object.
This beauty mu&s;t be <HI>felt,</HI> as well as <HI>perceived;</HI>
the mind mu&s;t be touched and affected by it
in a lively and &s;en&s;ible manner. This feeling
however, in order to con&s;titute true <HI>ta&s;te,</HI>
mu&s;t not be a vague and confu&s;ed &s;en&s;ation;
but mu&s;t be attended with a di&s;tinct view, a
quick and comprehen&s;ive di&s;cernment of the
various qualities, in their &s;everal relations and
connexions, which enter into the compo&s;ition
of the object we contemplate. And in this
we &s;ee another &s;triking re&s;emblance between
the intellectual ta&s;te and the &s;en&s;ual one; for
as a nice palate perceives immediately the
mixture of different wines, &s;o the man of

of different &s;tyles in the &s;ame production;
and let the beauties and defects be ever &s;o

latter.</P>
<P>AS the corruption of the <HI>&s;en&s;ual ta&s;te</HI> di&s;|covers
it&s;elf by a reli&s;h for only tho&s;e delicate
and high &s;ea&s;oned di&s;hes, in which all the

a forced &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure; &s;o the de|pravity

by an attachment to far-fetched and &s;tudied

The corruption of the &s;en&s;ual ta&s;te, which
makes us delight in &s;uch aliments as are di&s;|gu&s;ting

and the laboured &s;tiffne&s;s of art, to the
beautiful &s;implicity of nature, le&s;s a di&s;ea&s;e in
our mental frame.</P>
<P>THE intellectual <HI>ta&s;te</HI> is much more form|ed
by education and culture, than the &s;en&s;ual
one; for though the latter may be brought,
by habit, to reli&s;h what at fir&s;t excited loath|ing

of mankind &s;hould acquire by cu&s;tom and
experience, tho&s;e &s;en&s;ations and perceptions
which are nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ervation. It

formation requires time, in&s;truction, and ex|perience.
A young man unin&s;tructed in the

of mu&s;ic, the various parts who&s;e connexion
and relation con&s;titute the e&s;&s;ence and charm
of the compo&s;ition, nor will he perceive in
a picture the gradations of light and &s;hade,
that harmony of colours, that correctne&s;s of
de&s;ign which characterize a fini&s;hed piece;
but in proce&s;s of time, and al&s;o by degrees,
he learns both to hear and to &s;ee in a more
perfect manner. The &s;ame unin&s;tructed
per&s;on will find a variety of emotions ari&s;e in
his mind, the fir&s;t time he is pre&s;ent at the
repre&s;entation of a fine tragedy; but he will
neither perceive the dexterity of the author in
maintaining the unities, nor that exqui&s;ite
art by which the drama is &s;o managed, that
no per&s;on enters upon the &s;cene nor quits it
without an evident rea&s;on, nor yet that &s;till
more nice and difficult art of making the va|rious

&s;ubordinate intere&s;ts terminate and cen|ter
in one, which ab&s;orbs them all. It is
only by the force of habit and reflexion, that
he will di&s;tingui&s;h the&s;e &s;everal objects of
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and feel delightful &s;en&s;ations from cir|cum&s;tances,
of which formerly he had little

others, and thus excite <HI>ta&s;te</HI> in a nation,
which, without them, had never known it's
refined plea&s;ures. By frequently contempla|ting
the works of great and eminent ma&s;ters
in the various arts, the powers of nature
ari&s;e into <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and we imbibe, as it were,
the &s;pirit of the&s;e illu&s;trious men, &s;o as to
come at length to look at a gallery of paintings
with the eyes of a <HI>Le Brun,</HI> a <HI>Pou&s;&s;in,</HI> or a
<HI>Le Sueur;</HI> to hear the declamation of <HI>Quinaut's</HI>
operas, with the ear of a <HI>Lulli;</HI> and the airs
and &s;ymphonies with that of a <HI>Rameau.</HI> Nay,
we even read works of learning and genius,
with a portion of that &s;pirit that appears in
their compo&s;ition.</P>
<P>IF in the fir&s;t periods of the culture of the
arts and &s;ciences it has &s;ometimes happened
<PB N="218" REF="220">
that a whole nation have been unanimous in
the prai&s;e of authors full of defects, and whom
&s;ucceeding ages have beheld with indifference,
and even with contempt; the rea&s;on is, that
the&s;e authors had natural beauties which
were perceived by all, while that ju&s;t di&s;cern|ment
that was nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;tingui&s;h their
numerous defects, and which is le&s;s the gift
of nature, than the re&s;ult of time, habit, and
reflexion, was as yet acquired by none. Thus
<HI>Lucilius,</HI> who had been in the highe&s;t repu|tation
among the Romans, &s;unk into oblivion
when <HI>Horace</HI> aro&s;e; and <HI>Regnier</HI> was univer|&s;ally
admired by the French, until <HI>Boileau</HI>
appeared; and if there are &s;everal ancient
authors, who have maintained their credit,
notwith&s;tanding the ab&s;urdities that are to be
found in every page of their writings, it mu&s;t
be the authors of tho&s;e nations, among whom
no judicious and correct writer has appeared
to open their eyes, like <HI>Horace</HI> among the
Romans, and <HI>Boileau</HI> among the French.</P>
<P>IT is a common &s;aying, that there is no
di&s;puting about ta&s;tes: And if by <HI>ta&s;te</HI> here be
under&s;tood the palate, which loaths certain
aliments and reli&s;hes others, the maxim is
ju&s;t; becau&s;e it is needle&s;s to di&s;pute about
<PB N="219" REF="221">
what cannot be corrected, or to attempt re|forming
the con&s;titution and mechani&s;m of
organs merely corporeal. But the maxim is
fal&s;e and pernicious, when applied to that
<HI>intellectual ta&s;te,</HI> which has for it's objects the
arts and &s;ciences. As the&s;e objects have real
charms, &s;o there is in reality a good ta&s;te
which perceives them, and a bad one which
perceives them not; and there are certain
methods, by which we may often correct
tho&s;e mental defects which produce a depra|ved
<HI>ta&s;te.</HI> But it mu&s;t be granted, at the
&s;ame time, that there are certain phlegmatick
&s;pirits, which nothing can enflame, and al&s;o
certain di&s;torted intellects, which it is im|po&s;&s;ible
to rectify; with &s;uch therefore, it
is in vain to di&s;pute about ta&s;tes, becau&s;e
they have none at all.</P>
<P>IN many things Ta&s;te &s;eems to be of an
arbitrary nature, and without any fixed or
uniform direction, &s;uch as in the choice of
dre&s;s and equipage, and in every thing that
does not come within the circle of the finer
arts. In this low &s;phere it &s;hould be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed,
methinks, by the name of <HI>fancy;</HI>
for it is <HI>fancy</HI> rather than <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> that produces
<PB N="220" REF="222">
&s;uch an endle&s;s variety of new and contradic|tory
modes.</P>
<P>THE ta&s;te of a nation may degenerate and
become extremely depraved; and it almo&s;t
always happens that the period of it's perfec|tion
is the forerunner of it's decline. Arti&s;ts
through the apprehen&s;ion of being regarded
as mere imitators, &s;trike out into new and un|common
paths, and turn a&s;ide from the beau|tiful
&s;implicity of nature, which their prede|ce&s;&s;ors
invariably kept in view. In the&s;e ef|forts
there is a certain degree of merit, which
ari&s;es from indu&s;try and emulation, and ca&s;ts
a veil over the defects which accompany their
productions. The publick, fond of novelty,
applauds their invention; but this applau&s;e
is &s;oon &s;ucceeded by &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. A
new &s;et of arti&s;ts &s;tart up, invent new me|thods
to plea&s;e a capricious ta&s;te, and depart
&s;till further from nature than tho&s;e who fir&s;t
ventured from it's paths into the wilds of
fancy. Thus the ta&s;te of a people degene|rates
into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t corruption. Over|whelmed
with new inventions, which &s;uc|ceed
and efface each other with incredible
rapidity, they &s;carcely know where they are,
and ca&s;t back their eager and anxious de&s;ires
<PB N="221" REF="223">
towards the period, when <HI>true ta&s;te</HI> reigned
under the empire of nature. But they implore
it's return in vain; that happy period cannot
be recalled, it depo&s;its however in the cu&s;to|dy
of certain choice &s;pirits the &s;ublime plea|&s;ures
of <HI>true ta&s;te,</HI> which they cheri&s;h and
enjoy in their little circle, remote from the
profane eye of the depraved and capricious
multitude.</P>
<P>THERE are va&s;t countries, where <HI>ta&s;te</HI> has
not yet been able to penetrate. Such are
tho&s;e uncultivated wa&s;tes, where civil &s;ociety
has never been brought to any degree of
perfection, where there is little intercour&s;e
between the &s;exes, and where all repre&s;enta|tions
of living creatures in painting and &s;culp|ture
are &s;everely prohibited by the laws of
religion. Nothing renders the mind &s;o
narrow, and &s;o little, if I may u&s;e that
expre&s;&s;ion, as the want of &s;ocial inter|cour&s;e;
this confines it's faculties, blunts
the edge of genius, damps every noble
pa&s;&s;ion, and leaves in a &s;tate of languor
and inactivity every principle, that could
contribute to the formation of <HI>true ta&s;te.</HI>
Be&s;ides, where &s;everal of the finer arts are
wanting, the re&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily langui&s;h
<PB N="222" REF="224">
and decay, &s;ince they are in&s;eparably con|nected
together, and mutually &s;upport each
other. This is one rea&s;on, why the A&s;i|aticks
have never excelled in any of the
arts, and hence al&s;o it is that <HI>true ta&s;te</HI>
has been confined to certain countries in
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>

<P>THE philo&s;ophical &s;pirit, &s;o celebrat|ed
by one part of our nation, and &s;o
decried by another, has produced different
and even contrary effects, according as we
con&s;ider it with re&s;pect to the Sciences, or in
relation to the Belles Lettres. Operating in
the &s;phere of &s;cience, to which it properly
<PB N="224" REF="227">
belongs, it has &s;et limits to that pa&s;&s;ion for
explaining all things which aro&s;e from the
towering pride of &s;y&s;tem; but entering into
the circle of Belles Lettres it has pre&s;umed,
on the contrary, to analy&s;e our plea&s;ures, to
call be$$ $word$ it's tribunal the more elegant
feelings of the human mind, and to &s;ubmit
to it's examination the various objects of
<HI>ta&s;te.</HI> If the wi&s;e moderation, which has
been ob&s;erved, in the&s;e later times, by phi|lo&s;ophers
in matters of &s;cience, has met with
much contradiction; is it &s;urprizing that the
encroaching &s;pirit of the new adventurers in
literature has al&s;o been oppo&s;ed? This phi|lo&s;ophical
&s;pirit, applied to the objects of
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> mu&s;t undoubtedly di&s;plea&s;e &s;uch of our
writers as imagine, that, in matters of ta&s;te,
as well as in tho&s;e of a more &s;erious kind,
every paradox ought to be rejected, every
new opinion bani&s;hed, and that, merely
becau&s;e it is new. This way of thinking,
however, appears to me both unrea&s;onable
and pernicious; we cannot extend too far the
liberty of examining, judging, and inventing
in matters of &s;peculation and literary amu&s;e|ment,
even though, in many ca&s;es, that
liberty &s;hould be utterly un&s;ucce&s;sful in it's
efforts. The flight of genius mu&s;t be un|re&s;trained,
<PB N="225" REF="228">
&s;ince it is often in the mid&s;t of it's
wilde&s;t excur&s;ions that it creates the true
&s;ublime. Such al&s;o is the ca&s;e with the fa|culty
of rea&s;on, or the philo&s;ophical &s;pirit.
Let us therefore permit this di&s;cerning &s;pirit
to extend indi&s;criminately, though &s;ometimes
without &s;ucce&s;s, it's in&s;pection to all the ob|jects
of our plea&s;ures, and by that means
put it in a capacity of &s;triking out new paths,
and conducting genius it&s;elf into unknown
regions.</P>
<P>ONE of the great advantages of philo&s;ophy
in it's application to matters of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> is it's
being &s;o admirably adapted to cure, or to
prevent, that exce&s;&s;ive veneration for a certain
cla&s;s of authors, which we may call by the
name of literary &s;uper&s;tition. It will ju&s;tify
our e&s;teem of the ancients by rendering that
e&s;teem rational, and reducing it within it's
proper bounds; it will prevent our admiring
them in their defects; it will &s;hew us their
equals in &s;everal of our modern writers, who,
becau&s;e they have followed the models exhi|bited
by the ancients, are &s;o unrea&s;onably
mode&s;t as to e&s;teem them&s;elves inferior to
their ma&s;ters. But it will be a&s;ked, whether
this method of analyzing metaphy&s;ically mat|ters
<PB N="226" REF="229">
of feeling and &s;entiment, will not be at|tended
with many inconveniencies? Whe|ther
it will not often engage us to enquire
into the rea&s;ons of things which have no rea|&s;on
at all, damp our plea&s;ure by leading us
into the cu&s;tom of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing coldly what was
de&s;igned by nature to touch and to inflame,
and put &s;uch &s;hackles upon true genius, as to
render it &s;ervilely timorous, and check it's
enterprizing ardour? Let us endeavour to
give a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer to the&s;e important
que&s;tions.</P>
<P>TASTE, though far from being generally
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, yet is by no means an arbitrary
thing. This is a truth acknowledged on all
&s;ides, both by tho&s;e who reduce <HI>ta&s;te</HI> to mere
feeling and perception, and by tho&s;e al&s;o
who would bring it within the &s;phere of rea|&s;oning
and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve
at the &s;ame time, that all the beauties and
perfections, which appear in the productions
of nature or of art, are not properly the ob|jects
of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> who&s;e perceptions are le&s;s ex|ten&s;ive
than many are apt to imagine. There
are certain charms of a &s;ublime and &s;triking
kind, which equally affect all ob&s;ervers, and
of which, con&s;equently, all the various or+ders
<PB N="227" REF="230">
of mankind, in all ages and nations of
the world, are competent judges. But there
is al&s;o another &s;pecies of beauty, which only
affects tho&s;e minds, that are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a
certain delicacy of feeling, and which remains
imperceptible to vulgar &s;pirits. The beauties
which belong to this cla&s;s, are beauties only
of a &s;econd order; becau&s;e objects, which
excite the idea of grandeur, &s;urpa&s;s tho&s;e
which affect us only by their gracefulne&s;s and
elegance. The charms however of this &s;e|cond
cla&s;s of objects are tho&s;e, which it re|quires
the mo&s;t &s;agacity to di&s;cern, and the
greate&s;t delicacy to feel truly; and according|ly
they abound mo&s;t in tho&s;e nations where
&s;ocial intercour&s;e has contributed to the per|fection
of the arts, and multiplied the &s;ources
of plea&s;ure and enjoyment. It is then in
this cla&s;s of beauty, which is adapted to the
contemplation of the di&s;cerning few, that we
are properly to look for the objects of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI>
The&s;e ob&s;ervations lead us naturally to define
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> as the <HI>Faculty of di&s;tingui&s;hing, in the
works of art, the various qualities which are
adapted to excite plea&s;ure or di&s;gu&s;t, in minds
that are &s;u&s;ceptible of delicate &s;entiments and
perceptions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="231">
IF then <HI>ta&s;te</HI> be not an arbitrary thing, it
mu&s;t be founded on fixed and evident princi|ples,
by the application of which, we may
form a deci&s;ive judgment of all the various pro|ductions
of art. The truth is, that the
&s;ource of our plea&s;ures and of our di&s;gu&s;ts
lies &s;olely and intirely within our&s;elves; &s;o
that, if we reflect with attention upon our
mental frame, we &s;hall find there general
and invariable rules of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> which will &s;erve
as the criterion of beauty and deformity, in
all the objects, which the fecundity of the
different arts pre&s;ents to our view. From
hence it follows, that the &s;ame philo&s;ophical
&s;pirit, which obliges us, for want of &s;ufficient
evidence, to &s;u&s;pend every moment our en|quiries
about the nature and qualities of tho&s;e
objects that are without us, ought, on the
contrary, to animate our re&s;earches with re&s;|pect
to the objects and the nature of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI>
which lies obvious to our examination, as
it exi&s;ts within us, and con&s;titutes a part of
our mental frame. The true philo&s;opher
will, at the &s;ame time, ea&s;ily perceive that
this examination mu&s;t be confined within
proper limits. We mu&s;t never, in our re|&s;earches
upon any &s;ubject, flatter our&s;elves
with the hopes of ri&s;ing to <HI>Fir&s;t principles,</HI>
<PB N="229" REF="232">
which a thick veil perpetually conceals from
the eyes of mortals. To inve&s;tigate the pri|mitive
and metaphy&s;ical cau&s;e of our various
plea&s;ures would be as chimerical a project,
as to attempt explaining the operation of ex|ternal
objects upon our &s;en&s;es. But as the
origin of our knowledge has been reduced to
a &s;mall number of &s;en&s;ations; &s;o the &s;ources
of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, that are relative to <HI>ta&s;te,</HI>
may be traced out by a few evident ob&s;ervations
upon the manner in which we perceive and
feel. Thus far the true &s;age extends his re|&s;earches,
but here al&s;o he &s;tops, and de&s;cends
from hence, as from fir&s;t principles, to tho&s;e
con&s;equences that re&s;ult from his accurate
ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>IN analyzing <HI>ta&s;te</HI> we &s;hall find many qua|lities
nece&s;&s;ary to the proper exerci&s;e of that
perceptive power which e&s;cape the notice of
inattentive ob&s;ervers. It does not con&s;i&s;t
wholly in accuracy and rectitude of judg|ment,
however rare and precious this quality
may be, nor yet in a delicate &s;en&s;ibility alone.
No: there is yet, farther, a con&s;iderable
a&s;&s;emblage of &s;en&s;es and powers (if I may &s;o
&s;peak) which enters into it's compo&s;ition,
and which we mu&s;t therefore carefully take
<PB N="230" REF="233">
into the account. A few examples will il|lu&s;trate
this ob&s;ervation. When we read a
&s;ublime piece of poetry, what are the powers
and faculties of our nature to which the bard
addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf? They are various; &s;ome|times
he &s;peaks to our imagination, &s;ome|times
to our affections, &s;ometimes to our
rea&s;on, but always to the external &s;en&s;e or
organ of hearing. Ver&s;e is a &s;pecies of har|mony,
with re&s;pect to which the ear is too
delicate to admit of the lea&s;t defect; &s;o that
rea&s;on it&s;elf, upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, is obliged
to make certain &s;acrifices to rhime. A philo|&s;opher
then, with all his penetration and de|licacy
of &s;entiment, will be an incompetent
judge of poetry, if he has not a good ear.
He will a&s;&s;ert that the plea&s;ures which re&s;ult
from poetick harmony are merely chimerical;
that all authors of whatever kind their pro|ductions
may be, ought to addre&s;s them&s;elves
alone to the under&s;tanding and the heart;
nay, by captious rea&s;onings he will ca&s;t an
apparent ridicule upon the care and indu&s;try,
which are employed in arranging words and
periods, &s;o as to render them harmonious
and plea&s;ing to the ear. Thus a natural
philo&s;opher, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no other external
<PB N="231" REF="234">
&s;en&s;e but that of <HI>feeling,</HI> would hold it as a
thing impo&s;&s;ible, that di&s;tant objects &s;hould
operate upon our bodily organs, and would
prove his a&s;&s;ertion by &s;ophi&s;tical arguments,
to which no &s;atisfactory an&s;wer could be gi|ven,
as long as he was deprived of <HI>&s;ight</HI> and
<HI>hearing.</HI> Such is the ca&s;e of that philo&s;opher,
who, without a delicate ear, pretends to
have a <HI>ta&s;te</HI> for poetry. He imagines he
does no real injury to a poem, when, by
tran&s;po&s;ing the words, he de&s;troys their har|mony
and cadence, and he will attribute the
languor and flatne&s;s, which the poem acquires
by this change, to the power of prejudice
and cu&s;tom, to which he acknowledges his
own involuntary &s;ubjection. He will never
once imagine, that, by breaking the mea&s;ure
and tran&s;po&s;ing the words, he has de&s;troyed
the delightful harmony that re&s;ulted from
their metrical arrangement and proportions.
To judge however properly of &s;uch a conduct
we have only to a&s;k our&s;elves, what we
&s;hould think of a mu&s;ician, who, to prove
that the plea&s;ure of melody is founded in
opinion and not in nature, &s;hould &s;poil a fine
air by de&s;troying the proportion and &s;ymmetry
of the &s;ounds, of which it was compo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="232" REF="235">
IT is not thus that the true philo&s;opher
will judge of the plea&s;ures that ari&s;e from po|etry,
Avoiding wi&s;ely all extremes, he will
neither attribute them entirely to <HI>nature</HI> on
the one hand, nor wholly to <HI>opinion</HI> on the
other. He will ob&s;erve, that, as all nations
are more or le&s;s agreeably affected with the
charms of mu&s;ick in general, though they
may not all delight in the &s;ame particular
kinds of melody; &s;o, in like manner, they
are all, in general, &s;u&s;ceptible of plea&s;ure
from poetick harmony, though the poetry of
one people may differ extremely from that of
another. It is by examining attentively this
difference, that the true &s;age will be able
at length to determine how far the plea&s;ures
we receive from poetry and mu&s;ick are in|fluenced
by <HI>habit;</HI> what <HI>real</HI> additions they
derive from thence, and what <HI>imaginary</HI>
ones they receive from <HI>opinion.</HI> For he
will ever di&s;tingui&s;h between that plea&s;ure,
which is the re&s;ult of habit, and that which
is arbitrary, and merely founded on opinion;
a di&s;tinction hitherto not &s;ufficiently attended
to, in treating this &s;ubject, but which, not|with&s;tanding,
daily experience &s;ufficiently
<PB N="233" REF="236">
ju&s;tifies. There are certain plea&s;ures that
&s;trike us immediately, and that pervade the
&s;oul the very moment that their objects are
pre&s;ented; there are others, which require
time to produce their proper effect; which
are received with indifference or di&s;gu&s;t, un|til
the mind has been modified by their action
upon it to a certain degree, and are then en|joyed
with the quicke&s;t &s;en&s;ations of delight.
How often has it happened, that a piece of
mu&s;ick which we have heard, for the fir&s;t
time, without any agreeable emotion, has
excited afterwards in us the mo&s;t extatick
raptures, when, by it's being often repeated,
the ear has been at length able to di&s;tingui&s;h
it's complicated charms, and to perceive
the whole delicacy and force of it's expre&s;&s;i|on.</P>
<P>THIS is a &s;triking in&s;tance of the plea&s;ures
which ari&s;e from habit, and which mu&s;t by
no means be looked upon as arbitrary, be|cau&s;e
they may be, at fir&s;t, received with
indifference, and have the force of prejudice
again&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="237">
THUS a philo&s;ophical connoi&s;&s;eur will be
careful to maintain every faculty and every
&s;en&s;e in their re&s;pective privileges, and to at|tribute
to a good ear the authority that be|longs
to it, in deciding concerning the merit
of poetical compo&s;itions. But, at the &s;ame
time, he will be far from thinking, that the
poet's attention to plea&s;e the external &s;en&s;e
can ju&s;tify his di&s;pen&s;ing with the more im|portant
obligation of &s;atisfying the rea&s;on and
imagination of his readers, by the ju&s;tne&s;s of
his ideas, and the &s;ublimity of his views. As
he is per&s;uaded that the fir&s;t and mo&s;t im|portant
rule of good writing requires a con|formity
between the &s;tyle of an author, and
the matter which he treats, &s;o nothing will
di&s;gu&s;t him more than common and trivial
ideas expre&s;&s;ed with affectation, and adorned
with the vain pomp and harmony of poe|try.
A plain and ea&s;y pro&s;e will, in his
opinion, be preferable to &s;uch numbers as
derive their principal merit from their ca|dence,
and little or none from the truths
and &s;entiments which they are employed
to embelli&s;h and &s;et off. Feelingly &s;en&s;ible
al&s;o of the charms of poetick imagery, he is,
on that very account, plea&s;ed with &s;uch ima|ges
<PB N="235" REF="238">
alone, as are new and &s;triking; and yet
even to the&s;e he will prefer, without he&s;ita|tion,
tho&s;e beautiful &s;entiments which unfold,
in a noble and affecting manner, truths that
are u&s;eful to mankind.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, however, be carefully ob&s;erved,
that though a philo&s;opher be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all
that variety of &s;en&s;es and faculties that enter
into the compo&s;ition of true <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> yet this is
not all that is required in the matter now
under con&s;ideration; it is farther nece&s;&s;ary,
that the exerci&s;e of the&s;e faculties be not too
much confined to one particular &s;et of objects.
The famous <HI>Malebranche</HI> could not read the
mo&s;t &s;ublime ver&s;es without a certain weari|ne&s;s
and di&s;gu&s;t; and yet his &s;tyle abounds
with all the grand characters of poetry, and
is full of imagination, &s;entiment, and har|mony;
but his imagination, entirely occupied
about matters purely intellectual, confined
it's energy to the creation of philo&s;ophical
&s;y&s;tems; and the high degree of feeling and
vivacity with which he was endued, only
&s;erved to make him embrace with ardour, as
truth, what was no more than mere hypothe|&s;is.
Though his pro&s;e was extremely har|monious,
<PB N="236" REF="239">
yet poetical harmony had no charms
to him; which may perhaps be owing to one
of the following rea&s;ons: either that the &s;en|&s;ibility
of his ear was confined to the harmo|ny
of pro&s;e; or that a mechanical and natu|ral
talent enabled him to write harmonious
pro&s;e without his perceiving it, ju&s;t as his
imagination had &s;erved him in philo&s;ophy
without his knowledge, or as a mu&s;ical in|&s;trument
produces, without con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,
well-proportioned &s;ounds.</P>
<P>IT is not only to a want of delicacy in the
mind, or of &s;en&s;ibility in the external organs
of perception, that we are to impute all er|roneous
judgments in matters of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> The
plea&s;ure we receive from any excellent pro|duction
of art, is, or may be derived from
different &s;ources. The true philo&s;ophical
analy&s;is con&s;i&s;ts therefore, in di&s;tingui&s;hing
well the&s;e various &s;ources, and keeping them
&s;eparate from each other, that &s;o we may
refer to each what properly belongs to it,
and may not attribute our plea&s;ures to cau&s;es
that have had no &s;ort of influence in their
production. It has been ob&s;erved, that the
rules of each art &s;hould be taken from the
<PB N="237" REF="240">
mo&s;t excellent compo&s;itions which each re&s;|pective
art has furni&s;hed, and the ob&s;ervation
is undoubtedly ju&s;t. It is not however by
the confu&s;ed aggregate of plea&s;ure, by the
collective re&s;ult of the agreeable perceptions,
which the&s;e compo&s;itions have produced in us
that we are to fix the rules of <HI>ta&s;te;</HI> but by
that reflex act of the mind, which enables
us to di&s;tingui&s;h the particular pa&s;&s;ages that
excited in us delightful &s;en&s;ations from tho&s;e
which were only de&s;igned as &s;hades in the
piece, or as re&s;ting places for the exhau&s;ted
attention of the reader, and al&s;o from tho&s;e
where the author has exhibited marks of in|voluntary
negligence. For want of ob&s;erving
this method the imagination warmed by cer|tain
beauties of the noble&s;t kind, which may
&s;hine forth in a work, otherwi&s;e full of the
mo&s;t mon&s;trous defects, will gradually become
in&s;en&s;ible of the&s;e defects; nay, will tran&s;|form
them into beauties, and conduct us at
length to that &s;tupid enthu&s;ia&s;m, which, by
admiring every thing indi&s;criminately, per|ceives,
or rather feels nothing truly. Thus
by a confu&s;ed and mechanical impre&s;&s;ion,
many will be led either to e&s;tabli&s;h fal&s;e rules
of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> or, what is equally pernicious, to
<PB N="238" REF="241">
&s;ub&s;titute arbitrary notions in the place of
fixed principles; to contract the &s;phere of the
arts; to pre&s;cribe bounds to our plea&s;ures in
order to render them in&s;ipidly uniform, and
to confine the efforts of genius and indu&s;try
within a narrow circle.</P>
<P>IT is the province of philo&s;ophy to break
the&s;e inglorious bonds a&s;under; but &s;he can|not
be too circum&s;pect in the choice of the
arms, by which this noble deliverance is
to be accompli&s;hed. The late Mon&s;. <HI>De
la motte</HI> maintained that ver&s;ication was not
e&s;&s;ential to dramatical compo&s;itions; but to
prove an opinion &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of a rational
defence, he injudiciou&s;ly launched into para|dox,
wrote again&s;t poetry in general, and
thereby did nothing but injury to his cau&s;e:
he might as well have wrote again&s;t mu&s;ick
of every kind, in order to prove, that the cho|rus
is not e&s;&s;ential to tragedy. This ingenious
writer was under no nece&s;&s;ity of combating
the prejudices of the publick again&s;t his opini|on,
by &s;uch &s;en&s;ele&s;s paradoxes. There was,
methinks, a much &s;horter way of proving his
point, and that was, to have compo&s;ed his
celebrated tragedy of <HI>In&eacute;s de Ca&s;tro</HI> in pro&s;e,
<PB N="239" REF="242">
the affecting nature of a &s;ubject &s;o tenderly
intere&s;ting, &s;hould have encouraged him to
venture upon this innovation, and thus the
theatre would have been enriched with a new
&s;pecies of dramatick poetry. But an ambi|tious
de&s;ire of being di&s;tingui&s;hed from the
crowd leads men &s;ometimes to combat, in
theory, received opinions, while a timorous
&s;elf-love, that dreads all new and dangerous
attempts through the apprehen&s;ion of mi&s;|carrying,
obliges them to follow tho&s;e very
opinions in practice. It is here that we may
ob&s;erve a con&s;iderable difference between the
philo&s;opher and the legi&s;lator; the latter di&s;|pen&s;es,
in his private conduct, with the laws
which he impo&s;es upon others; while the
philo&s;opher ob&s;erves in his work, the rules
which he condemns in his preface.</P>
<P>THE two &s;ources of error which we have
been hitherto con&s;idering, <HI>viz.</HI> the want of
&s;en&s;ibility, on the one hand, and the want of
that reflexion, which is requi&s;ite to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the true cau&s;es of our plea&s;ures, on the
other, will be the occa&s;ion of perpetuating
that tedious controver&s;y, &s;o often renewed,
and &s;o injudiciou&s;ly carried on, the merit of
<PB N="240" REF="243">
the ancients. Their advocates, under the
impul&s;e of an enthu&s;ia&s;tick admiration, are
too prone to exalt their productions upon the
whole, on account of the &s;triking beau|ties
that appear in &s;ome of the parts; while
their adver&s;aries refu&s;e tho&s;e applau&s;es that
are due to the parts, on account of the defects
that appear in the whole.</P>
<P>THERE is however another error, into
which the philo&s;ophical critick is more liable
to fall, and to avoid which, he mu&s;t con&s;e|quently
employ his principal attention. This
error con&s;i&s;ts in applying to the peculiar objects
of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> principles, which, though true in
them&s;elves, yet have no relation to the&s;e ob|jects.
Every one is acquainted with tho&s;e
lines in the tragedy of the <HI>Horatii,</HI></P>
<Q><L>Que vouliez vous qu'il fit contre trois? Qu'il mourut.</L>
<L>Ou qu'un beau de&s;e&s;poir alors le &s;ecur&ucirc;t<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To enable tho&s;e, who don't under&s;tand the <HI>French</HI> lan|guage, to enter into the true &s;pirit of this ingenious critici&s;m, it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that in <HI>Corneille's</HI> tragedy of the <HI>Horatii,</HI> a me&s;&s;enger arrives to inform the old <HI>Horatius,</HI> that two of his &s;ons were killed, and that the third was flying from the three <HI>Curiatii.</HI> The venerable old man is filled with in|dignation at the conduct of his remaining &s;on. The me&s;&s;enger to excu&s;e him, addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus to the incen&s;ed father: <HI>What other re&s;ource had be than flight, overpowered as he was by three combatants? A glorious death</HI> (replies the old <HI>Hora|tius) or that &s;uccour that is admini&s;tred by a noble de&s;pair.</HI> The&s;e words <HI>A glorious death,</HI> which are equivalent to <HI>Qu'il mourut,</HI> conclude the fir&s;t line in the <HI>French,</HI> and give us a &s;triking in&s;tance of the true &s;ublime. What follows is cen&s;ured by Mr. <HI>D' Alembert</HI> for the excellent rea&s;ons offered in his elegant ob&s;ervations on this pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>The heroick expre&s;&s;ion of the aged father
<HI>Qu'il mourut,</HI> has been ju&s;tly and univer&s;ally
<PB N="241" REF="244">
admired; and the following ver&s;e as ju&s;tly
and univer&s;ally condemned; and yet the
common principles of metaphy&s;icks will fur|ni&s;h
arguments or rather &s;ophi&s;ms, to ju&s;tify
this ver&s;e again&s;t all the rules of true <HI>ta&s;te.</HI>
It will be alledged, for in&s;tance, that this &s;e|cond
ver&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s all the feel|ings
that pa&s;&s;ed in the mind of the old <HI>Hora|tius;</HI>
for though it was his duty to prefer the
death of his &s;on to a life of di&s;honour; yet it
was &s;till more natural to wi&s;h that his &s;on
might e&s;cape by the means of his valour, and
that, animated by a <HI>noble de&s;pair,</HI> he might
&s;tand alone again&s;t his three adver&s;aries, and
return victorious from the combat. This
defence, however plau&s;ible upon metaphy&s;i|cal
principles, is ab&s;olutely mi&s;applied in the
<PB N="242" REF="245">
ca&s;e before us, where the que&s;tion is not
concerning the mere expre&s;&s;ion of truth and
nature, but concerning &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions of
both as are &s;triking and &s;ublime. According
to the rea&s;oning of the metaphy&s;ical critick,
the &s;econd ver&s;e, as it contains the &s;entiment
that is the mo&s;t natural of the two, &s;hould
have preceded the fir&s;t, which, by that means,
would have lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of it's force.
Be&s;ides; nothing more feeble, flat, and fri|gid
than this &s;econd ver&s;e, even when re&s;|tored
to it's true and natural place. For
where is the nece&s;&s;ity for the old <HI>Horatius's</HI>
expre&s;&s;ing the de&s;ire which that ver&s;e con|tains?
Will not every one &s;uppo&s;e, without
difficulty, that it would have been infinitely
more rejoicing to him to have &s;een his &s;on
living, and crowned with victory, than fal|ling
a victim to the &s;uperior force of his ene|mies?
The poet then had no occa&s;ion to ex|pre&s;s
a de&s;ire which every one mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e:
the only &s;entiment which &s;uited that violent
&s;tate of emotion in which the venerable old
man now was, the only affection which was
proper to be di&s;covered upon &s;uch an occa&s;ion,
and in circum&s;tances where the glory of his
country and of his name were immediately
<PB N="243" REF="246">
concerned, was that heroick courage, which
engaged him to choo&s;e for his &s;on a noble
death rather than a life of di&s;honour and in|famy.
The cold and tardy rea&s;onings of
&s;low and phlegmatick &s;pirits are very different
from the &s;udden and prodigious bounds,
which minds, nobly fired, make towards
the true &s;ublime; the latter, di&s;daining to
remain, even for a moment, in the &s;phere
of vulgar &s;entiments, under&s;tand much more
than they expre&s;s, and &s;oar with a rapid
flight to tho&s;e &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions that
carry the &s;tronge&s;t marks of energy and
grandeur. Their progre&s;s re&s;embles that of
one of <HI>Homer's</HI> gods, who&s;e fourth &s;tride
brought him from one end of the univer&s;e to
the other.</P>
<P>THUS then it happens, that, in matters of
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> the demi-philo&s;opher (if I may employ
that term) leads us from the paths of truth
and nature, to which it is the province of
true philo&s;ophy to re&s;tore our wandering &s;teps.
It is therefore an injury done both to the
Belles Lettres and to Philo&s;ophy, to imagine
that they are either incompatible with, or pre|judicial
to each other. Whatever relates to
<PB N="244" REF="247">
our ideas and perceptions, and even to our
&s;entiments and feelings, is the true domain,
the proper &s;phere of philo&s;ophy. It would
therefore be as unrea&s;onable to confine her
to the heavenly bodies, or to the material
&s;y&s;tem of the univer&s;e, as it would be to limit
poetry to the prai&s;es of the gods, or the
plea&s;ures of love. The true &s;pirit of philo|&s;ophy
is &s;o far from being in oppo&s;ition to
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> that it is, on the contrary, it's mo&s;t
&s;olid &s;upport, as it teaches us always to &s;et
out from true and evident principles, to ob|&s;erve
that every art has it's peculiar nature,
every &s;ituation and affection of the mind it's
proper character, and every object it's di&s;tinct|ive
colouring, and thus prevents our con|founding
the limits by which the various
kinds are &s;o carefully di&s;tingui&s;hed. Such
is the nature, excellence, and power of the
philo&s;ophical &s;pirit, the abu&s;e of which,
&s;hews that it is not truly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked by &s;ome, that the
&s;ubmitting the objects of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> to analytical
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is adapted to blunt the delicacy of
the feeling powers, and to damp the fire and
vigour of genius. But this effect is not to be
<PB N="245" REF="248">
feared. The true philo&s;opher knows that
in the moment when genius creates and in|vents,
it will not admit of the lea&s;t check
or re&s;traint; that it loves to ru&s;h forward
without controul and without rule, to produce
indi&s;criminately the mon&s;trous and the &s;ub|lime,
and to carry down it's rapid &s;tream
gold and mud mingled together by the impe|tuo&s;ity
of it's cour&s;e. Rea&s;on, therefore,
gives to genius, while it creates a boundle&s;s
liberty, and even permits it to continue it's
career until it exhau&s;ts it's vigour and &s;inks
down to repo&s;e, like tho&s;e firey cour&s;ers,
which it is impo&s;&s;ible to tame any other way
than by throwing the bridle upon their necks.
But then it is the time for rea&s;on to exerci&s;e
it's authority, and to &s;it in judgment upon
the productions of genius. Accordingly, it
pre&s;erves whatever was the off-&s;pring of a
true and noble enthu&s;ia&s;m, effaces, on the
contrary, whatever was produced by the ir|regular
&s;allies of an over-heated imagination,
and thus enriches the republick of letters
with ma&s;terly performances in all the various
kinds. Where is the writer of genius and
<HI>ta&s;te,</HI> who does not perceive in the heat of
compo&s;ition, that one part of his mind (if I
<PB N="246" REF="249">
may &s;o expre&s;s my&s;elf) &s;eparates it&s;elf from
the other which is employed in compo&s;ing,
in order to ob&s;erve it's motions, and to give
them a free cour&s;e, and al&s;o points out before
hand what is afterwards to be effaced?</P>
<P>THE true philo&s;opher u&s;es much the &s;ame
method in judging of the productions of
others, that he employs in compo&s;ing his
own. He begins by giving him&s;elf up to the
high and lively &s;en&s;ations of plea&s;ure, which
generally ari&s;e from the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion that
a new and ma&s;terly performance makes upon
the mind. Per&s;uaded however, that real
beauties gain in proportion as they are atten|tively
examined, he recollects him&s;elf; ex|tends
his re&s;earches to the cau&s;es of his &s;ati&s;|faction;
&s;ingles them out one after another;
di&s;tingui&s;hes carefully between illu&s;ory &s;en&s;a|tions,
and deep and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions; and
by this analytical procedure is rendered capa|ble
of pronouncing with judgment concern|ing
the merit of a work in general, and of
each of it's particular and con&s;tituent parts.</P>
<P>FROM the&s;e ob&s;ervations we &s;hall be fur|ni&s;hed
with an an&s;wer to a que&s;tion, which
<PB N="247" REF="250">
has been often propo&s;ed, and al&s;o much de|bated,
<HI>viz.</HI> Whether, in judging concerning
a work of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> &s;entiment or feeling is to be
preferred before rea&s;oning and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion?
<HI>Feeling</HI> is undoubtedly the natural judge for
the fir&s;t moment, <HI>Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion</HI> for the &s;econd,
and the &s;econd judge will, almo&s;t always,
confirm the deci&s;ions of the fir&s;t in tho&s;e
per&s;ons, who, with a quick and delicate
&s;en&s;e of beauty, are &s;o happy as to po&s;&s;e&s;s a
ju&s;t and accurate di&s;cernment. But the dif|ficulty,
it will be alledged, &s;till remains;
for as &s;entiment and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion will not always
be agreed, what mu&s;t be done when they
differ? Is it not be&s;t in all ca&s;es to follow
&s;entiment as our guide, and hold always by
it's deci&s;ion? Is it not a mi&s;erable occupation,
will many a&s;k, to be di&s;puting again&s;t our
agreeable &s;en&s;ations, and what obligations
&s;hall we lie under to philo&s;ophy if it mani|fe&s;tly
tend to dimini&s;h our plea&s;ures? We
cannot an&s;wer this latter que&s;tion without
the utmo&s;t regret; becau&s;e we are obliged
to acknowledge the effect of philo&s;ophy to
be, in reality, what it is here repre&s;ented to
be.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="251">
SUCH is the unhappy lot of humanity,
that the knowledge we acquire &s;erves only
to give us a mortifying view of the &s;cenes of
error and illu&s;ion, through which we have
pa&s;&s;ed, and is, almo&s;t always, attended with
the diminution of our plea&s;ures. The rude
&s;implicity of our ance&s;tors rendered the im|pre&s;&s;ions
they received from the mon&s;trous
productions of the ancient theatre, more live|ly
and &s;triking than tho&s;e which we receive,
in this poli&s;hed age, from the mo&s;t perfect
of our dramatick performances. The nations,
which we &s;urpa&s;s in knowledge and in re|finement,
are not le&s;s happy than we are;
&s;ince both their de&s;ires and their wants are
le&s;s numerous than ours, and they are &s;ati&s;|fied
with plea&s;ures of a le&s;s elegant kind,
than tho&s;e which we pur&s;ue. We &s;hould
not, however, be willing to exchange our
knowledge for the ignorance of tho&s;e nations,
or for the rude &s;implicity of our ance&s;tors.
For, though this knowledge may dimini&s;h
our plea&s;ures, yet it flatters our vanity. We
applaud our&s;elves on account of that delicacy
and refinement, that render us difficult to be
plea&s;ed, and even look upon them as merito|rious.
<PB N="249" REF="252">
Self-love is the reigning pa&s;&s;ion, and
that which, generally &s;peaking, we are the
mo&s;t eager to gratify. The plea&s;ure we de|rive
from thence, is not, like many others,
the effect of a &s;udden and violent impre&s;&s;ion;
it is uniform and permanent, and may there|fore
be enjoyed at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>THESE reflexions, methinks, will be e&s;|teemed
&s;ufficient to ju&s;tify philo&s;ophy from
the accu&s;ations that have been brought again&s;t
it by ignorance and envy. We cannot how|ever
conclude without ob&s;erving, that even
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that the&s;e accu&s;ations
and reproaches were ju&s;t, yet they lo&s;e their
influence, and become un&s;eemly, when they
are not made by philo&s;ophers them&s;elves. To
them alone it belongs to determine the &s;phere,
and to fix the boundaries of the philo&s;ophical
&s;pirit; as it belongs only to tho&s;e who have
wit, to plead again&s;t the abu&s;e that may be
made of it. But it unluckily happens, in op|po&s;ition
to this rule, that tho&s;e who have the
lea&s;t acquaintance with philo&s;ophy are its mo&s;t
violent detracters; ju&s;t as poetry is decried by
&s;uch as have no talent for that noble art; the

De MONTESQUIEU.</HEAD>
<P>THE con&s;titution of human nature in
it's pre&s;ent &s;tate, opens to the mind
three different &s;ources of plea&s;ure; one in
it's internal faculties and e&s;&s;ence, another in
it's union with the body, and a third in tho&s;e
impre&s;&s;ions and prejudices, that are the re&s;ult
of certain in&s;titutions, cu&s;toms, and habits.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="257">
THESE different plea&s;ures of the mind
con&s;titute the proper objects of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> tho&s;e
objects which we term beautiful, good,
agreeable, natural, delicate, tender, grace|ful,
elegant, noble, grand, &s;ublime, and
maje&s;tick, as al&s;o the qualities to which we
give the name of <HI>Je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HI> When,
for in&s;tance, the plea&s;ure we enjoy in the
contemplation of any object is accompanied
with a notion of it's utility to us, we call that
object <HI>good;</HI> but when an object appears
merely agreeable, without being advantageous,
we then term it <HI>beautiful.</HI></P>
<P>THE ancients do not &s;eem to have fully
apprehended this important di&s;tinction; they
con&s;idered as things of a <HI>po&s;itive</HI> nature tho&s;e
qualities, or rather perceptions, which are
merely <HI>relative</HI> to the nature and operations
of the &s;oul. Hence, tho&s;e dialogues &s;o ce|lebrated
by the ancients, in which <HI>Plato</HI> gives
us an ample account of the rea&s;onings of his
great ma&s;ter, are, in our times, un&s;u&s;cepti|ble
of a rational defence, becau&s;e they are
founded upon the principles of a fal&s;e phi|lo&s;ophy.
All the rea&s;onings they contain
<PB N="259" REF="258">
concerning goodne&s;s, beauty, perfection,
wi&s;dom, folly, hardne&s;s, &s;oftne&s;s, &amp;c. are
intirely inconclu&s;ive<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">This ob&s;ervation is intirely erroneous; for granting <HI>goodne&s;s, beauty, hard, &s;oft,</HI> &amp;c. to be merely perceptions of the mind, and nothing really exi&s;ting <HI>without us;</HI> yet if the&s;e perceptions be invariably excited by certain objects and not by others, if they ari&s;e uniformly when the&s;e objects are pre&s;ented, they form, of con&s;equence, fixed and permanent relations, which render all the rea&s;onings founded on them as conclu&s;ive, as if the&s;e perceptions were the inherent qualities of external objects. The tran&s;lator thought this error of too much con|&s;equence to pa&s;s it over in &s;ilence.</NOTE>, as they &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e
various perceptions to be what they are not,
real and po&s;itive qualities.</P>
<P>THE &s;ources, therefore, of beauty, good|ne&s;s,
&amp;c. lie within us, and, of con&s;equence,
when we enquire into their cau&s;es, we do no
more than inve&s;tigate the &s;prings of our men|tal
plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>LET us then turn the eye of the mind up|on
it&s;elf, examine it's inward frame, con&s;i|der
it in it's actions, and it's pa&s;&s;ions, and
contemplate it in it's plea&s;ures in which it's
true nature is be&s;t di&s;covered. It derives
plea&s;ure from poetry, painting, &s;culpture,
architecture, mu&s;ick, dancing, in a word,
<PB N="260" REF="259">
from the various productions of nature and
art. Let us, therefore, inquire into the
rea&s;ons that render the&s;e objects plea&s;ing, as
al&s;o into the manner of their operation, and
the times and circum&s;tances in which they
produce their agreeable effects, and thus give
an account of our various feelings. This
will contribute to the formation of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI>
which is nothing more than the faculty of
di&s;covering with quickne&s;s and delicacy the
degree of plea&s;ure, which we &s;hould receive
from each object that comes within the &s;phere
of our perceptions.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the plea&s;ures of the mind.</HEAD>
<P>THE mind, be&s;ides tho&s;e plea&s;ures which
it receives by the organs of &s;en&s;e, enjoys
others which are peculiar to it's &s;piritual na|ture,
and are ab&s;olutely independent on ex|ternal
&s;en&s;ation. Such are the plea&s;ures that
ari&s;e from curio&s;ity, from the ideas of it's
own exi&s;tence, grandeur and perfections,
from the faculty of taking a general and com|prehen&s;ive
view of things, of contemplating
a great variety of objects, and of comparing,
combining and &s;eparating it's own ideas.
<PB N="261" REF="260">
The&s;e plea&s;ures, which are attached to the
nature of every intelligent being, depend not
upon the external &s;en&s;es, but re&s;ide in the ve|ry
e&s;&s;ence of the &s;oul; and it is needle&s;s to
inquire whether the &s;oul enjoys them, in
con&s;equence of it's union with the body, or
not; all that is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know is,
that it enjoys them always, and that they are
the true and proper objects of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI> We
&s;hall not, therefore, take any notice here of
the di&s;tinction that may be made between
the plea&s;ures that the &s;oul derives from it's
own e&s;&s;ence, and tho&s;e that re&s;ult from it's
union with the body, but &s;hall comprehend
both the&s;e kinds of enjoyment under the com|mon
name of <HI>natural plea&s;ures.</HI> The&s;e plea|&s;ures
we mu&s;t, however, di&s;tingui&s;h from
others that have certain connexions with them,
and which we may call <HI>acquired plea&s;ures.</HI>
In the &s;ame manner, and al&s;o for the &s;ame
rea&s;ons, we di&s;tingui&s;h between the <HI>ta&s;te</HI>
which is <HI>natural,</HI> and that which is <HI>ac|quired.</HI></P>
<P>IT is of great u&s;e in re&s;earches of this
kind to know the &s;ource of tho&s;e plea&s;ures of
which <HI>ta&s;te</HI> is the rule or mea&s;ure: Since the
<PB N="262" REF="261">
knowledge of our plea&s;ures, whether <HI>natural</HI>
or <HI>acquired,</HI> will contribute much towards
the rectifying the two kinds of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> that cor|re&s;pond
to them. We cannot truely appre|ciate
our plea&s;ures, nor indeed enjoy them
with a proper reli&s;h, if we do not carefully
examine the nature of tho&s;e plea&s;ures, and
their fir&s;t &s;prings in the human con&s;titution.</P>
<P>IF our &s;ouls had not been united to mate|rial
&s;ub&s;tances, they would &s;till have been
capable of knowledge, but it is probable they
would have loved whatever they knew;
whereas, in the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of things,
we &s;carcely love any thing but that of which
we are ignorant.</P>
<P>THE con&s;titution of our nature is an arbi|trary
thing; we might have been otherwi&s;e
con&s;tituted than we are at pre&s;ent; and, in
that ca&s;e, our perceptions and feelings would
have been quite different from what they
now are. An external organ of &s;en&s;ation
more or le&s;s would have given ri&s;e to a &s;pec|ies
of poetry and eloquence totally different
from that which takes place at pre&s;ent; nay,
even another contexture of the organs we
<PB N="263" REF="262">
po&s;&s;e&s;s would have changed va&s;tly the nature
of poetry; for in&s;tance, Had the con&s;titution
of our mental and bodily powers rendered
our attention and application of mind more
vigorous and con&s;tant than what they are at
pre&s;ent, this circum&s;tance would have pre|vented
the exi&s;tence of tho&s;e rules, which
are de&s;igned to adapt the di&s;po&s;ition of a &s;ub|ject
to that mea&s;ure of attention of which we
are capable: Had we been naturally endowed
with a more perfect degree of &s;agacity and
penetration, all the rules which are founded
upon the degree which we now po&s;&s;e&s;s,
mu&s;t have been entirely different: In a word,
all the laws that derive their exi&s;tence and au|thority
from a certain con&s;titution of our na|ture,
would have been totally different, upon
the &s;uppo&s;ition of it's being otherwi&s;e con&s;ti|tuted.</P>
<P>IF the &s;en&s;e of fight had been more feeble
and confu&s;ed than it actually is, it would
have been nece&s;&s;ary to have introduced into
the plans of the architect fewer ornaments,
and more uniformity; but the contrary rule
mu&s;t have taken place had our fight been
more di&s;tinct, piercing, and comprehen&s;ive.
<PB N="264" REF="263">
Had our &s;en&s;e of hearing been con&s;tituted like
tho&s;e of many other animals, the mo&s;t of our
mu&s;ical in&s;truments would have required a
quite different con&s;truction and modulation.
It is true the relations of things to each other
would have &s;till continued the &s;ame, let the
con&s;truction of our organs have been ever &s;o
different from what it now is; but their re|lation
to us being totally changed, they would
not have produced in us the effects they now
produce. And as the per&s;ection of the arts
con&s;i&s;ts in their pre&s;enting to us their re&s;pec|tive
objects in &s;uch a manner as will render
them as agreeable and &s;triking as is po&s;&s;ible;
&s;o a different con&s;titution of our nature from
the pre&s;ent, would, nece&s;&s;arily, require a
change in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the arts adapted
to the change which that new con&s;titution
would occa&s;ion in the means of enjoyment,
in the manner of being agreeably affected.</P>
<P>WE are, at fir&s;t fight, prone enough to
imagine that a knowledge of the various
&s;ources of our plea&s;ures is &s;ufficient in order
to the attainment of what is called <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> and
that the man who has &s;tudied the dictates of
philo&s;ophy upon this &s;ubject is a man of <HI>ta&s;te.</HI>
<PB N="265" REF="264">
and may judge with confidence concerning
all the productions of nature and art. But
this is a mi&s;take: for the <HI>natural ta&s;te</HI> does
not con&s;i&s;t in a theoretick knowledge, but in
the quick and exqui&s;ite application of rules
which, in &s;peculation, may be really unknown
to the mind. It is not, for example, nece&s;|&s;ary
to know that the plea&s;ure we receive
from a certain object which we call beautiful
is the effect of &s;urprize; it is enough that
the object produces it's effect, and &s;urpri&s;es
neither more nor le&s;s than is expedient for that
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>ALL, therefore, that can be &s;aid upon the
&s;ubject before us, and all the precepts that we
can lay down for forming our <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> can only
regard directly that <HI>ta&s;te</HI> that is to be acqui|red,
though they have a di&s;tant and indirect
relation to the <HI>natural</HI> one. This indirect re|lation
is manife&s;t; for the <HI>acquired ta&s;te</HI> af|fects,
changes, augments and dimini&s;hes the
<HI>natural</HI> one, ju&s;t as the former is affected,
changed, augmented and dimini&s;hed by the
latter.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="265">
THE mo&s;t general definition that can be
given of <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> con&s;idered antecedently to it's
divi&s;ion into good and bad, is, that it is &s;ome|thing
which attaches us to certain objects by
the power of an internal &s;en&s;e, or feeling.
This account, however, does not &s;uppo&s;e that
it may not be applied to intellectual things,
the knowledge of which is &s;o delightful to the
mind, that it has been looked upon by &s;ome
philo&s;ophers as the only &s;ource of true felici|ty.
The &s;oul acquires knowledge by it's ideas
and it's inward &s;en&s;es or feelings<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a good deal of difficulty in tran&s;lating the <HI>French</HI> word <HI>&s;entiment</HI> by any other term than that of <HI>feeling.</HI> The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> word <HI>&s;entiment</HI> in the &s;ingular number may be u&s;ed methinks to render the <HI>French</HI> term, and I have ventured to apply it &s;everal times in this &s;en&s;e, leaving out the particle <HI>a,</HI> which attaches to it another meaning in our language.

certain that the &s;oul <HI>feels</HI> whatever it <HI>perceives,</HI>
and there are no objects &s;o ab&s;tru&s;ely intellec|tual

<HEAD>Concerning curio&s;ity.</HEAD>
<P>THE human mind is naturally formed
for thinking or perceiving, and <HI>curio&s;ity</HI> is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to &s;uch a being: for as all things are
connected in nature, and every idea and object
are in the great chain of being immediately
preceded by their cau&s;es, and as immediately
followed by their effects, &s;o we cannot de&s;ire
the knowledge of one object without being
de&s;irous al&s;o of arriving at the knowledge of
tho&s;e that are intimately related to it. Thus
when we &s;ee the part only of an excellent
piece of painting, we are eagerly de&s;irous of
a &s;ight of what remains concealed from our
view, and the eagerne&s;s of this de&s;ire is pro|portioned
to the plea&s;ure we received from
what we had already &s;een.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="268">
IT is, therefore, the plea&s;ure which we have
received from one object, that carries forward
our de&s;ires towards another; hence the mind
is always bent upon the pur&s;uit of &s;omething
new, and never enjoys a permanent repo&s;e.</P>
<P>THUS may we always be &s;ure of admini&s;|tring
plea&s;ure to the mind, by pre&s;enting to
its contemplation a multitude of objects, or
even, a greater number than it expected to
&s;ee.</P>
<P>By the&s;e ob&s;ervations we may be enabled
to explain the rea&s;on, why we receive plea|&s;ure
both from the view of a regular garden,
and al&s;o from a rural pro&s;pect, in which there
is neither order nor proportion. The plea|&s;ure
we receive from the&s;e different objects
ari&s;es originally from the &s;ame cau&s;e, even
from the natural de&s;ire we have of &s;eeing a
multitude of objects. This de&s;ire renders us
eager to extend our views, and to wander
from place to place; the mind, under it's im|pul&s;e,
abhors all limits, and would willingly
enlarge the &s;phere of its contemplation, and
even of it's actual pre&s;ence; and thus one of
it's great plea&s;ures is, to take in a large and
di&s;tant pro&s;pect. But this plea&s;ure is not ea|&s;ily
<PB N="270" REF="269">
attained: in towns and cities our view is
ob&s;tructed by various ranges of buildings; in
the country it is limited and interrupted by
many ob&s;tacles. What then is to be done?
Why, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to art, which
comes to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and di&s;clo&s;es nature
which was concealed from our &s;ight; in this
ca&s;e we are more plea&s;ed with art, than with
nature, that is to &s;ay, with nature veiled and
un&s;een. But when nature pre&s;ents it&s;elf to
us in exten&s;ive pro&s;pects, in variegated land|&s;capes,
where the eye can roam uncontrouled
through meadows and woods, through ri&s;ing
grounds and flowery plains, the mind is quite
otherwi&s;e elated and tran&s;ported with the&s;e
rural &s;cenes, than with the gardens of <HI>Le No|tre;</HI>
becau&s;e &s;uch is the fecundity of nature,
that it is always new and original, whereas
art copies and re&s;embles it&s;elf in all its pro|ductions.
This al&s;o is the rea&s;on why in
painting we are more plea&s;ed with a rural
land&s;cape, than with a correct plan of the
fine&s;t garden upon the earth; becau&s;e the
painter repre&s;ents nature in tho&s;e &s;cenes, where
&s;he appears with the greate&s;t beauty, with
the mo&s;t &s;triking variety, where the eye can
<PB N="271" REF="270">
ramble at liberty, and behold her in all her
charms with plea&s;ure and delight.</P>
<P>THAT which, generally &s;peaking, renders
a thought grand and &s;triking, is when the ob|ject
it repre&s;ents opens to our view a multi|tude
of other objects with which it is con|nected,
&s;o that we di&s;cover of a &s;udden, and,
as it were, in&s;tantaneou&s;ly what we had no
hopes of knowing without a con&s;iderable de|gree
of attention and application.</P>

<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the plea&s;ures, which ari&s;e
from order.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not &s;ufficient to exhibit to the mind
a multiplicity of objects; it is farther requi|&s;ite
that they be exhibited with order and ar|rangement,
for then it retains what it has
&s;een, and al&s;o forms to it&s;elf &s;ome notion of
what is to follow. One of the highe&s;t men|tal
plea&s;ures is that which we receive from a
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the extent of our views, and
the depth of our penetration; but in a produc|tion
void of order this plea&s;ure is impeded;
the mind, de&s;irous to &s;upply from its own
ideas this want of regularity, is perplexed in
the vain attempt; it's plan mingles it&s;elf with
that which the author of the work had form|ed,
and this produces a new confu&s;ion. It re|tains
nothing, fore&s;ees nothing; it is dejected
by the confu&s;ion that reigns in it's ideas, and
by the comfortle&s;s void that &s;ucceeds the abun|dance
and variety of it's vain recources. It's fa|tigue
is without it's effect, and efforts are un&s;uc|ce&s;sful.
<PB N="273" REF="272">
Hence the judicious arti&s;t always in|troduces
a certain order, even amid&s;t confu&s;ion,
where confu&s;ion is not the main object, the
principal thing to be expre&s;&s;ed. Hence the
painter throws his figures into groups; and
when he draws a battle, repre&s;ents, as it were,
in the front of his piece, the principal objects
which the eye is to di&s;tingui&s;h, and ca&s;ts at a
di&s;tance, by the magick of per&s;pective, the
groups where confu&s;ion and di&s;order reign.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the plea&s;ure that ari&s;es from
variety.</HEAD>
<P>IF order be thus nece&s;&s;ary in all &s;orts of
productions, <HI>variety</HI> is no le&s;s &s;o; without
<HI>variety</HI> the mind falls into a lifele&s;s inactivity
and languor; for &s;imilar objects appear to it
as if they were wholly the &s;ame; &s;o that if
a part of a piece of painting was di&s;clo&s;ed to
our view, which carried a &s;triking re&s;emblance
of another part of the &s;ame piece that we had
already &s;een, this &s;econd part would be real|ly
a new object without appearing &s;uch, and
would be contemplated without the lea&s;t &s;en|&s;ation
<PB N="274" REF="273">
of plea&s;ure. The beauties we di&s;cern
in the productions of art, as well as in the
works of nature, con&s;i&s;ting entirely in the
plea&s;ure they admini&s;ter, it is nece&s;&s;ary &s;o to
modify the&s;e beauties as to render them the
means of diver&s;ifying our plea&s;ures as far as
is po&s;&s;ible. We mu&s;t employ our indu&s;try
in offering to the eye of the mind objects
which it has not as yet &s;een, and in exciting
within it feelings different from tho&s;e which
it may have already experienced.</P>
<P>THUS Hi&s;tory plea&s;es by the variety of
facts and relations which it contains; Ro|mance
by the variety of prodigies it invents;
and Dramatic Poetry by the variety of pa&s;&s;ions
which it excites. Thus al&s;o they who are
well ver&s;ed in the art of education endeavour

<P>UNIFORMITY carried on to a certain
length renders every thing in&s;upportable. The
&s;ame arrangement of periods continued for a
long time fatigues in a piece of eloquence.
The &s;ame numbers and cadences become ex|tremely
<PB N="275" REF="274">
tedious in a long poem. If the ac|counts
given of the famous <HI>Vi&s;ta</HI> or alley that
extends from <HI>Mo&s;cow</HI> to <HI>Peter&s;burg</HI> be true,
the traveller, pent up between the&s;e two
&s;eemingly endle&s;s rows of trees, mu&s;t feel the
mo&s;t di&s;agreeable la&s;&s;itude and &s;atiety in the
continuance of &s;uch a dull uniformity. Nay,
even pro&s;pects which have the charm of <HI>va|riety,</HI>
cea&s;e to plea&s;e, if they be repeated with|out
much alteration, and are for a long time
pre&s;ent to the mind. Thus the traveller, who
has been long wandering through the <HI>Alps,</HI>
will de&s;cend &s;atiated with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive
views, the mo&s;t romantick and delightful
land&s;capes.</P>
<P>THE human mind loves <HI>variety,</HI> and the
rea&s;on is, as we have already ob&s;erved, that it
is naturally framed for contemplation and
knowledge. If then the love of variety is
&s;ubordinate and adapted to the attainment of
knowledge, it is requi&s;ite, that variety, whe|ther
in the productions of nature or art, be
&s;uch as will facilitate knowledge; or, in other
words, an object mu&s;t be &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;imple</HI>
to be perceived with ea&s;e, and &s;ufficiently <HI>di|ver&s;ified</HI>
to be contemplated with plea&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="275">
THERE are certain objects, which have the
appearance of variety, without the reality; and
others, that &s;eem to be uniform, but are, in
effect, extremely diver&s;ified.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gothic</HI> architecture appears extremely
rich in point of variety, but it's ornaments fa|tigue
the eye by their confu&s;ion and minute|ne&s;s.
Hence we cannot ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h one
from the other, nor fix our attention upon any
one object, on account of the multitude that
ru&s;h at once upon the &s;ight; and thus it hap|pens
that this kind of architecture di&s;plea&s;es
in the very circum&s;tances that were de&s;igned
to render it agreeable.</P>
<P>A <HI>Gothic</HI> &s;tructure is to the eye what a rid|dle
is to the under&s;tanding; in the contem|plation
of it's various parts and ornaments the
mind perceives the &s;ame perplexity and con|fu&s;ion
in it's ideas, that ari&s;e from reading an
ob&s;cure poem.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture, on the contra|ry,
appears uniform; but as the nature, and
the number al&s;o of it's divi&s;ions are preci&s;ely
<PB N="277" REF="276">
&s;uch as occupy the mind without fatiguing
it, it has con&s;equently that degree of <HI>variety,</HI>
that is plea&s;ing and delightful.</P>
<P>GREATNESS in the <HI>whole</HI> of any produc|tion
requires of nece&s;&s;ity the &s;ame quality in
the <HI>parts.</HI> Gigantic bodies mu&s;t have bulky
members; large trees mu&s;t have large bran|ches,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such is the nature of things.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grecian</HI> architecture, who&s;e divi&s;ions
are few, but grand and noble, &s;eems formed
after the model of the great and the &s;ublime.
The mind perceives a certain maje&s;ty which
reigns through all it's productions.</P>
<P>THUS the painter di&s;tributes the figures,
that are to compo&s;e his work, into various
groups; and in this he follows nature and
truth, for a crowd is almo&s;t always divided
into &s;eparate companies. In the &s;ame man|ner
in every complex piece of painting we &s;ee
the lights and &s;hades di&s;tributed into large
ma&s;&s;es, which &s;trike the eye at a di&s;tance, be|fore
the whole compo&s;ition is di&s;tinctly per|ceived.</P>

<DIV2>
<PB N="278" REF="277">
<HEAD>Concerning the plea&s;ure that ari&s;es from
&s;ymmetry.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved that variety is
plea&s;ing to the human mind; and we mu&s;t
farther remark, that a certain degree of <HI>&s;ym|metry</HI>
produces al&s;o an agreeable effect, and
contributes to the beauty of the greate&s;t part
of tho&s;e complex productions, which we be|hold
with admiration and delight. How
&s;hall we reconcile this &s;eeming contradiction!
It will vani&s;h if we attend to the following
ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>ONE of the principal cau&s;es of the plea&s;ure,
which the mind receives in the contemplation
of the various objects that are pre&s;ented to it,
is the facility with which it perceives them.
Hence <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> is rendered agreeable, as it's
&s;imilar arrangements relieve the mind, aid the
quickne&s;s of it's comprehen&s;ion, and enable it,
upon a view of the one half of an object, to
form immediately an idea of the whole.</P>
<P>UPON this ob&s;ervation is founded the fol|lowing
general rule, That where <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> is
<PB N="279" REF="278">
thus u&s;eful to the mind, by aiding it's com|prehen&s;ion,
and facilitating it's operations and
it's perceptions, there it is, and mu&s;t always
be agreeable; but where it does not produce
this effect, it becomes flat and in&s;ipid, becau&s;e,
without any good purpo&s;e, it deprives an ob|ject
of that <HI>variety</HI> to which nature has given
&s;uperior charms. In tho&s;e objects which are
viewed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, <HI>variety</HI> is requi&s;ite, be|cau&s;e
they are di&s;tinctly perceived without the
lea&s;t difficulty. On the contrary, where a
multitude of objects are pre&s;ented to us in one
point of view, and ru&s;h in at once upon the
eye, there <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to aid us in+forming
quickly an idea of the whole. Thus
<HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> is ob&s;erved in the front of a build|ing,
in a parterre, in a temple; and there it
plea&s;es extremely for the rea&s;on now men|tioned,
it's aiding the mind to take in imme|diately
the whole object without pain, per|plexity,
or confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE object which the mind views not
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but, as it were, by one effort,
mu&s;t be <HI>&s;imple</HI> and <HI>one;</HI> all it's parts mu&s;t
unite in forming one de&s;ign, and mu&s;t relate
to one end. This is another con&s;ideration,
<PB N="280" REF="279">
that renders <HI>&s;ymmetry</HI> plea&s;ing, as it alone
properly con&s;titutes what we call a <HI>whole,</HI> or
the effect of a variety of parts that center in
one general de&s;ign.</P>
<P>THERE is yet another con&s;ideration that
pleads in favour of <HI>&s;ymmetry,</HI> and that is the
de&s;ire, &s;o natural to the mind, of &s;eeing every
thing fini&s;hed and brought to perfection. In
all complex objects there mu&s;t be a &s;ort of
counterbalance, or equilibrium between the
various parts that terminate in one <HI>whole;</HI> and
an edifice only with one wing, or with one
wing &s;horter than the other, would be as un|fini&s;hed
and imperfect a production as a body
with only one arm, or with two of unequal
length.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning contra&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>IF the mind takes plea&s;ure in <HI>&s;ymmetry,</HI> it
is al&s;o agreeably affected by <HI>contra&s;ts.</HI> This
requires explication, and a few examples will
&s;erve for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IF painters and &s;culptors, in obedience to
the directions of nature, are careful to ob&s;erve
<PB N="281" REF="280">
a certain &s;ymmetry in their compo&s;itions; the
&s;ame nature requires that the attitudes which
they repre&s;ent &s;hould contra&s;t each other; and
thus exhibit an agreeable variety, a plea&s;ing
oppo&s;ition to the eye of the &s;pectator. One
foot placed preci&s;ely in the &s;ame po&s;ition with
the other, or any two of the corre&s;ponding
parts of the body placed exactly in the &s;ame
direction, di&s;gu&s;t a judicious ob&s;erver, becau&s;e
this &s;tudied &s;ymmetry produces a perpetual
and in&s;ipid &s;amene&s;s of attitude, &s;uch as we
ob&s;erve in the <HI>Gothic</HI> figures, which all re|&s;emble
each other in this re&s;pect. Be&s;ides,
this uniformity of attitude is contrary to our
natural frame and con&s;titution; nature has
not de&s;igned that we &s;hould imitate in our
ge&s;tures the &s;tupid uniformity that is ob&s;er|vable
in the <HI>Indian</HI> Pagods: no; &s;he has
given us the power of &s;elf-motion and con|&s;equently
the liberty of modifying our air and
our po&s;ture as we plea&s;e. And if &s;tiffne&s;s and
affectation be un&s;upportable in the human
form, can they be plea&s;ing in the productions
of art?</P>
<P>THE attitudes therefore, particularly of
&s;uch figures as are repre&s;ented in &s;culpture,
<PB N="282" REF="281">
mu&s;t be contra&s;ted in order to give them an
agreeable air of variety and ea&s;e. What ren|ders
this more e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary in &s;culp|ture
is, that of all the arts it is naturally the
mo&s;t cold and lifele&s;s, and can only affect
and enflame by the force of it's contra&s;ts and
the boldne&s;s of it's po&s;tures.</P>
<P>BUT as, according to an ob&s;ervation al|ready
made, the variety which the <HI>Gothic</HI>
architects were &s;tudious to introduce into
their &s;tructures gave them an in&s;ipid air of
uniformity; &s;o has it happened that the va|riety,
which other arti&s;ts propo&s;ed effectua|ting
by the means of contra&s;ts, has degene|rated
al&s;o into a vicious &s;ymmetry.</P>
<P>THIS is not only ob&s;ervable in certain
productions of &s;culptors and painters, but al|&s;o
in the &s;tyle of certain authors, who, by
perpetual antithe&s;es form a contra&s;t between
the beginning and the end of each phra&s;e.
Of this we find &s;everal examples in <HI>St. Augu&s;|tin,</HI>
and others, who wrote during the low
periods of the <HI>Latin</HI> language; and al&s;o in
the writings of &s;everal moderns, particularly
tho&s;e of <HI>St. Evremont.</HI> The &s;ame cadence
<PB N="283" REF="282">
or jingle repeated in every phra&s;e is extreme|ly
di&s;agreeable and fa&s;tidious. <HI>Contra&s;ts</HI> thus
multiplied become intolerably uniform; and
tho&s;e oppo&s;itions, that were de&s;igned to pro|duce
variety, degenerate, by perpetual repe|tition,
into the mo&s;t tedious &s;ymmetry. The
mind finds &s;o little variety in this &s;ort of com|po&s;ition,
that having heard but one half of
a phra&s;e, it will always anticipate the other.
There is, indeed, a certain oppo&s;ition in the
words of each phra&s;e; but this oppo&s;ition is
always the &s;ame; and the flowing of each pe|riod,
though harmonious, is yet mo&s;t fa|tiguing
on account of the con&s;tant return of
the &s;ame kind of <HI>contra&s;ts.</HI></P>
<P>SEVERAL painters have fallen into this vi|cious
cu&s;tom of multiplying <HI>contra&s;ts</HI> beyond
mea&s;ure in all their compo&s;itions, &s;o that the
view of one &s;ingle figure will enable the acute
ob&s;erver to gue&s;s at the di&s;po&s;ition of all tho&s;e
that are contiguous to it. This perpetual
&s;tudy of diver&s;ity produces uniformity, as has
been ob&s;erved above. Be&s;ides, this pa&s;&s;ion
for multiplying <HI>contra&s;ts</HI> has no example in
nature, which operates, on the contrary,
with a &s;eeming di&s;order, void of all affecta|tion,
<PB N="284" REF="283">
and, &s;o far from giving to all bodies a
determinate and uniform motion, gives to a
great number no motion at all. The hand
of nature diver&s;ifies truly her multifarious pro|ductions;
&s;ome bodies &s;he holds in repo&s;e,
while &s;he impre&s;&s;es upon others an infinite
variety of tendencies and movements.</P>
<P>IF the merely intellectual faculties of our
nature determine us to take plea&s;ure in vari|ety,
our feeling powers are not le&s;s agreeably
affected by it. The mind cannot long bear
the &s;ame objects, the &s;ame plea&s;ures, the
&s;ame &s;ituations, if I may u&s;e that term, be|cau&s;e
it is united to a body to which they are
in&s;upportable. The activity of the mind, and
it's &s;en&s;ations and feelings depend upon the
cour&s;e of the animal &s;pirits that circulate in
the nerves; there are, of con&s;equence, two
circum&s;tances that &s;u&s;pend their vigour, <HI>viz.</HI>
the la&s;&s;itude of the nerves, and the di&s;&s;ipation
of the animal &s;pirits, or their entire ce&s;|&s;ation.</P>
<P>THUS every thing fatigues us after a cer|tain
time; this, at lea&s;t, is undoubtedly true
with re&s;pect to tho&s;e plea&s;ures that are ex|tremely
inten&s;e; we quit them always with
<PB N="285" REF="284">
the &s;ame &s;atisfaction with which we embra|ced
them; the fibres which were their in&s;tru|ments
have need of repo&s;e; we mu&s;t there|fore
employ others that are in a condition to
&s;erve us, and thus di&s;tribute equally to the
various parts of our frame the functions they
are to perform in rendering us active and
happy.</P>
<P>THE &s;oul finds it's vigour exhau&s;ted by
any long and inten&s;e feeling. But to be de&s;|titute
of &s;entiment or feeling, is to fall into
a void which &s;inks and overwhelms our bet|ter
part. We remedy this di&s;order, or ra|ther
prevent this di&s;agreeable alternative by
diver&s;ifying the modifications and plea&s;ures
of the mind, and then it feels without
wearine&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the plea&s;ure which is the
effect of &s;urpri&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition that renders variety
agreeable to the mind, is al&s;o the occa&s;ion of
tho&s;e plea&s;ures which it receives from <HI>&s;urpri&s;e.</HI>
This feeling of &s;urpri&s;e plea&s;es both from the
nature of it's object, and the quickne&s;s and
<PB N="286" REF="285">
rapidity with which it acts upon the mind,
which perceives either an object it did not ex|pect,
or an object pre&s;ented in a different
manner from that which it imagined before|hand.</P>
<P>SURPRISE is excited by &s;uch objects as are
either marvellous, new, or unexpected; and
in tho&s;e ca&s;es where we are &s;truck with the
marvellous, the principal feeling is accompa|nied
with an acce&s;&s;ory &s;en&s;ation which ari&s;es
from this, that the object which we con|template
as marvellous is al&s;o new and unex|pected.</P>
<P>HENCE games of hazard attract the whole
attention of the mind, and affect in a lively
and agreeable manner by pre&s;enting to it a
continual train of unexpected events; and
hence al&s;o ari&s;es the plea&s;ure we take in tho&s;e
games in which we are a&s;&s;ociated with part|ners,
for they are al&s;o a combination of un|fore&s;een
events produced by the joint influ|ence
of dexterity and hazard.</P>
<P>WE may farther reduce to the &s;ame prin|ciple
the chief plea&s;ure we receive from dra|matick
<PB N="287" REF="286">
compo&s;itions, in which we find an
important &s;eries of events developed by de|grees,
the mo&s;t &s;triking occurrences &s;tudiou&s;|ly
concealed until the very moment of their
arrival, all the powers of invention employed
to create new objects of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e,</HI> and in
which we are &s;ometimes affected with a par|ticular
kind of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e</HI> upon &s;eeing things fall
out, ju&s;t as we might have conjectured be|fore
hand.</P>
<P>WE ob&s;erve, finally, that the productions
of wit and learning are read with eagerne&s;s
only becau&s;e they procure us the lively plea|&s;ure
of novelty and <HI>&s;urpri&s;e;</HI> and thus &s;upply
the defect of conver&s;ation which is, almo&s;t
always, uniform and in&s;ipid, and &s;eldom ex|cites
the agreeable feeling now under con&s;i|deration.</P>
<P>SURPRISE may be excited either by the ob|ject
it&s;elf that is pre&s;ented to our view, or
by the manner in which we perceive it, and
the circum&s;tances under which we con&s;ider
it; for an object may appear, in our per|ception,
greater or le&s;s than it is in reality;
it may appear different from what it actually
<PB N="288" REF="287">
is; and even in tho&s;e ca&s;es where we &s;ee it as
it is, we may &s;ee it under circum&s;tances,
which excite an acce&s;&s;ory feeling of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e.</HI>
Thus in the view of any work the mind may
be &s;truck with the circum&s;tantial or acce&s;&s;ory
idea of the difficulty of it's production, of the
per&s;on that contrived and fini&s;hed it, of the
time or manner in which it was executed,
or of any other circum&s;tances that are inti|mately
connected with it.</P>
<P><HI>SUETONIUS</HI> recites the crimes of
<HI>Nero</HI> with a certain coolne&s;s and tranquillity
which a&s;toni&s;h, and which almo&s;t per&s;uade
the reader that the enormities he de&s;cribes
excited but faintly, if at all, his indignation
and horror. But the hi&s;torian &s;tops &s;hort,
changes his &s;tyle &s;uddenly, and &s;ays, &startq;The
earth, having &s;uffered &s;uch a mon&s;ter to
breathe upon it's &s;urface for fourteen years,
abandoned him at la&s;t;&endq; <HI>Tale mon&s;trum per
quatuordecim annos perpe&s;&s;us terrarum orbis
tandem de&s;tituit.</HI> In this &s;hort, but emphatick
phra&s;e, the mind is &s;truck with different &s;en|&s;ations
of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e</HI> ari&s;ing from a variety of
circum&s;tances. We are &s;urpri&s;ed at the hi&s;|torian's
&s;udden change of &s;tyle, at the di&s;co|very
<PB N="289" REF="288">
of his being affected quite otherwi&s;e than
we, at fir&s;t, imagined, and at his de&s;crib|ing,
in &s;o few words, one of the &s;ignal re|volutions
that happened in the <HI>Roman</HI> empire.
Thus the mind is affected, at one and the
&s;ame time, by a variety of circum&s;tances
which concur to excite in it an agreeable emo|tion,
and to &s;trike it with a plea&s;ing &s;ur|pri&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the various cau&s;es which may
contribute to excite a &s;ingle feeling
or &s;en&s;ation in the mind.</HEAD>
<P>IT is nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve that, generally
&s;peaking, every &s;en&s;ation is excited by more
than one cau&s;e. The force of a &s;en&s;ation,
and that variety of feelings into which it may
be decompounded, are the re&s;ult of various
and di&s;tinct cau&s;es, which, however, operate
at one and the &s;ame time. The excellence
of wit and genius con&s;i&s;ts in their exerci&s;ing,
at once, &s;everal faculties of the mind, and
exciting in it a variety of feelings; and, if
we examine attentively the merit of the mo&s;t
celebrated authors, we &s;hall find that it lies
<PB N="290" REF="289">
principally in this; and that they plea&s;e in
proportion to the number of feelings which
they produce at the &s;ame in&s;tant in the
mind.</P>
<P>WE are more plea&s;ed with a regular gar|den
than with a confu&s;ed and crowded heap
of trees; but ob&s;erve the multiplicity of rea|&s;ons
on which this preference is founded:
1. Our view is le&s;s confined by the one than
by the other. 2. In a regular garden each
walk or alley forms a di&s;tinct and grand object,
while, in a confu&s;ed heap of trees, each tree
forms, indeed, a di&s;tinct object, but only a
minute and incon&s;iderable one. 3. We &s;ee
an arrangement and di&s;po&s;ition of things to
which we are not accu&s;tomed. 4. We ap|prove
and appreciate the pains and indu&s;try
that have been employed. 5. We admire
the care that has been taken to combat and
correct perpetually the irregular fecundity of
nature, which, by new and unde&s;ired pro|ductions,
&s;eems di&s;po&s;ed to involve in confu|&s;ion
the works of art; and this ob&s;ervation is
verified by the di&s;gu&s;t with which we behold
a garden, which has been neglected, and &s;uf|fered
to run wild. But farther, we receive
<PB N="291" REF="290">
plea&s;ure in the productions of art, not only
from various, but al&s;o from contrary cau&s;es:
Sometimes we are plea&s;ed with the difficulty
of a work; at others it is the facility of it's
execution that renders it agreeable. We of|ten
admire in the magnificence of a country|&s;eat
the &s;plendor and profu&s;ion of it's owner;
and, as often, are plea&s;ed with the art which
has formed a &s;triking and agreeable arrange|men
with little labour and expence.</P>
<P>PLAY affects us agreeably, becau&s;e it &s;a|tisfies
our avarice, and often fulfils the hopes
we entertain of making an addition to our
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; it flatters our vanity too, by a
&s;ecret con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of our being the favorites
of fortune, and by exciting the attention of
tho&s;e about us to our &s;ucce&s;s; it gratifies, al&s;o,
our curio&s;ity by pre&s;enting to our view a di|ver&s;ified
&s;pectacle of per&s;ons, characters, and
pa&s;&s;ions; in a word, it yields the various
plea&s;ures of <HI>&s;urpri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>DANCING plea&s;es by it's nimblene&s;s and
rapidity, by the gracefulne&s;s of it's motions,

<PB N="292" REF="291">
is &s;o intimate that we compare the dancer to
an in&s;trument which plays in concert. But
that which renders dancing peculiarly plea&s;ing

articulate founds. 2. Becau&s;e they can ne|ver

their mu&s;ick is intended to expre&s;s. 3. Be|cau&s;e

the other hand, the&s;e &s;ame per&s;ons are not
de&s;titute of qualities that render them agree|able
in certain re&s;pects, as they retain, much
longer than others, the bloom and air of
youth, and po&s;&s;e&s;s a flexibility and &s;weene&s;s

of voice which are peculiar to them&s;elves and

&s;ometimes in direct and violent oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>THE mind &s;ometimes augments it's enjoy|ment,
by the power of imagination, which
multiplies the cau&s;es of plea&s;ure by the con|nexions
it forms, and the acce&s;&s;ory ideas and
perceptions it creates. Thus an object that
has formerly plea&s;ed us, plea&s;es us &s;till, and
that for no other rea&s;on but that it has for|merly
plea&s;ed us, and that we connect the
pa&s;t idea with the pre&s;ent. Thus again, an
actre&s;s who has delighted us upon the &s;tage,
continues al&s;o to delight us in a chamber;
her voice, her pronunciation, the remem|brance
of the applau&s;es that crowned her
performance, nay a combination that we im|perceptibly
form between the idea of her and
that of the prince&s;s &s;he repre&s;ented upon
the &s;cene, all this variety, all this mixture

WE are full of acce&s;&s;ory perceptions and

that defect, and will even have credit
enough to make it pa&s;s for an ornament. The
greate&s;t part of the women we love have lit|tle

<HEAD>Concerning delicacy of perception and
feeling.</HEAD>
<P>PERSONS of a delicate mental frame
are tho&s;e, who to every idea, and every &s;en|&s;ation,
add a variety of acce&s;&s;ory ideas and &s;en|&s;ations.
Gro&s;s minds receive no more up|on
the view of an object than the &s;imple &s;en|&s;ation
which that object of it&s;elf is adapted to
excite; they neither know how to compound
nor to decompound their perceptions and
ideas; they neither augment nor dimini&s;h the
<PB N="295" REF="294">
gifts of nature. The ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e
with per&s;ons of a delicate turn of mind; they
refine upon vulgar &s;entiments, and improve
and multiply their agreeable &s;en&s;ations, e&s;pe|cially
in love, the greate&s;t part of who&s;e plea|&s;ures
is due to a quick and lively fancy. <HI>Po|lyxenes</HI>
and <HI>Apicius</HI> enjoyed at table a variety
of &s;en&s;ations of their own creating, which are
unknown to vulgar gluttons; and tho&s;e, who
judge with <HI>ta&s;te,</HI> concerning the productions
of wit and genius, have a multitude of per|ceptions,
both natural and acquired, which
are entirely peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>Concerning the Je ne &s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HEAD>
<P>WE find &s;ometimes in certain per&s;ons
and in certain objects an invi&s;ible charm, a
natural gracefulne&s;s, which has not been
hitherto defined, and which we have been
obliged to expre&s;s by the vague epithet <HI>Je ne
&s;&ccedil;ai quoi.</HI> It appears to me highly probable
that this &s;ecret charm is principally the effect
of &s;urpri&s;e. We are &s;en&s;ibly touched, when
we find certain per&s;ons more agreeable than
at fir&s;t &s;ight we imagined them to be; and
we are filled with a plea&s;ing kind of &s;urpri&s;e,
<PB N="296" REF="295">
when we &s;ee them triumph over tho&s;e de|fects,
which the eye &s;till perceives, but which
the heart no longer feels. Hence we find
often, among the female &s;ex, tho&s;e inexpre&s;&s;i|ble
graces adorn the ugly, which are very &s;el|dom
lavi&s;hed upon the fair and beautiful. A
beautiful nymph generally di&s;appoints our ex|pectations,
and appears, after &s;ome little time,
le&s;s amiable than at fir&s;t &s;ight; after having
&s;urpri&s;ed us at fir&s;t by her charms, &s;he falls
greatly off, and &s;urpri&s;es us at length by her
defects; but the fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;e is a pa&s;t plea|&s;ure,
which is become faint and languid, and
is almo&s;t effaced, whereas the &s;econd is a
fre&s;h and lively &s;en&s;ation of di&s;gu&s;t. Hence
it rarely happens that the beautiful are the
objects of a violent and durable pa&s;&s;ion, which
&s;eems rather re&s;erved for the <HI>agreeable,</HI> than
for the <HI>fair,</HI> for tho&s;e graces which &s;trike us
unexpectedly, and which indeed we had no
rea&s;on to expect. Sumptuous and magnifi|cent
robes are generally de&s;titute of that grace|ful
air, which we often find in the &s;implicity
of the &s;hepherd's habit. We admire the air
of maje&s;ty that reigns in the draperies of <HI>Paul
Verone&s;e;</HI> but we are al&s;o mo&s;t agreeably
touched with the &s;implicity of <HI>Raphael,</HI> and
<PB N="297" REF="296">
the graces that flow from the pencil of <HI>Cor|rege.
Paul Verone&s;e</HI> promi&s;es much, and per|forms
what he promi&s;es. <HI>Raphael</HI> and <HI>Cor|rege</HI>
promi&s;e little, but perform a great deal,
and this is doubly plea&s;ing to the &s;urpri&s;ed
&s;pectator.</P>
<P>THOSE graces that can render even defor|mity
agreeable, are more frequently centered
in the mind, than expre&s;&s;ed in the counte|nance.
A beautiful face di&s;clo&s;es at once all
it's charms, and conceals nothing; but an
amiable mind &s;hews it&s;elf only by little and
little, and at &s;uch times and in &s;uch a degree,
as it thinks proper; it can conceal it&s;elf dex|terou&s;ly
for a time, in order to &s;hine forth af|terwards
with a brighter lu&s;tre, and to admi|ni&s;ter
that kind of &s;urpri&s;e, to which the
graces often owe their exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THE graces are more rarely found in the
features of the face, than in the air and man|ners;
for the&s;e change every moment, and
may therefore every moment produce new
objects of &s;urpri&s;e. In a word, beauty is li|mited
to a certain &s;et of features; but grace|fulne&s;s
may re&s;ult from an infinite variety of
<PB N="298" REF="297">
circum&s;tances; &s;o that, if I may &s;o expre&s;s
my&s;elf, there is &s;carcely more than one way
of being <HI>beautiful,</HI> whereas there are an hun|dred
thou&s;and of being <HI>agreeable.</HI></P>
<P>A GENERAL rule of conduct e&s;tabli&s;hed
between the two &s;exes in all nations, whe|ther
&s;avage or civilized, requires, that the fir&s;t
propo&s;al of conjugal union &s;hould be made by
the men, and that the fair &s;hould have no|thing
more to do than to grant or to reject
the tender demands of love; and this very
circum&s;tance is a &s;ource of graces peculiar to
the &s;ex. As they are always obliged to be
upon the defen&s;ive, they are con&s;eqently obliged
to conceal their pa&s;&s;ions, and many of their
charms. Under this nece&s;&s;ary re&s;traint the
lea&s;t word, look, or ge&s;ture, that breaks loo&s;e
from it's confinement, without violating the
natural and primitive law of &s;hame-faced mo|de&s;ty,
becomes a grace, and produces a deli|cious
kind of &s;urpri&s;e. Such is the wi&s;e and
excellent con&s;titution of nature, that tho&s;e
things, which, without the &s;acred law of mo|de&s;ty,
would have been indifferent and in&s;i|pid,
are rendered mo&s;t agreeable and intere&s;t|ing
in con&s;equence of that law, which is a
<PB N="299" REF="298">
&s;ource of delicate &s;en&s;ations, and refined plea|&s;ure
to all rational beings.</P>
<P>As affectation and re&s;traint are incapable
of exciting &s;urpri&s;e, it follows that graceful|ne&s;s
is neither to be found in tho&s;e manners
that are under the fetters of re&s;traint, nor in
tho&s;e that are the re&s;ult of a laborious affecta|tion;
but in a certain ea&s;e, and liberty that
lies between the&s;e two extremes, the avoid|ing
of which is a circum&s;tance that &s;urpri&s;es
the mind in an agreeable manner.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that tho&s;e manners
which are the mo&s;t natural &s;hould be the
mo&s;t ea&s;y in practice; but the ca&s;e is quite
otherwi&s;e; for, by the re&s;traints of education
we always lo&s;e more or le&s;s of the ingenuous
&s;implicity of nature, who&s;e recovery yields a
high degree of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;trikes us &s;o agreeably in dre&s;s,
as that negligence and even di&s;order which
conceal the pains that have been taken, and
keep out of &s;ight all the art that cleanline&s;s
did not require, and that vanity alone could
employ. In the &s;ame manner wit is only
<PB N="300" REF="299">
agreeable, when it's &s;allies are flowing and
ea&s;y, and &s;eem rather luckily hit off, than la|boriou&s;ly
invented and far-fetched.</P>
<P>THE man who amu&s;es a company with
&s;mart &s;ayings, which are the fruits of preme|ditation
and &s;tudy, will pa&s;s indeed for a man
of wit, but not of that ea&s;y wit, which is the
&s;pontaneous effu&s;ion of nature, and in which
alone the graces di&s;play their genuine charms.
Grace in manners or in di&s;cour&s;e appears
mo&s;t in tho&s;e who are the lea&s;t con&s;cious of
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, and who&s;e plainne&s;s and &s;impli|city,
promi&s;ing nothing of that nature, occa|&s;ion
an agreeable &s;urpri&s;e in &s;uch as at length
perceive, in the mid&s;t of this &s;implicity, a qua|lity
which they &s;o little expected.</P>
<P>FROM all this we may conclude that the
graces now under con&s;ideration are not to be
acquired; in order to po&s;&s;e&s;s them we mu&s;t
be natural and ingenuous; and nothing is
more &s;elf-contradictory than the attempt of
&s;tudying to be natural.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t beautiful fictions in the
<HI>Iliad</HI> is that of the Girdle, which imparted to
<PB N="301" REF="300">
<HI>Venus</HI> the power of plea&s;ing. No image
could contribute &s;o happily to give us a notion
of the &s;ecret magick and influence of tho&s;e
graces which &s;eem to be &s;hed upon certain
per&s;ons by an invi&s;ible hand, and which are
intirely di&s;tinct from beauty. The my&s;terious
girdle could be given to no other than <HI>Venus.</HI>
It was not &s;uitable to the maje&s;tick beauty of
<HI>Juno;</HI> for maje&s;ty requires a certain gravity,
or, in other words, a certain degree of re&s;|traint
which is incon&s;i&s;tent with the ea&s;y and
carele&s;s &s;implicity of the graces; nor was it
better adapted to the bold and haughty air of
<HI>Pallas,</HI> as haughtine&s;s is irreconcileable with
the mild &s;weetne&s;s of the graces, and is often
liable to the &s;u&s;picion of affectation.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning &s;urpri&s;e in it's progre&s;&s;ive
&s;tate.</HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;ublime and &s;triking beauties
are to be found in tho&s;e objects, the fir&s;t view
of which excites but an incon&s;iderable emo|tion
of &s;urpri&s;e, an emotion, however, which
continues, augments, and breaks forth, at
la&s;t, into admiration and rapture. The
<PB N="302" REF="301">
works of <HI>Raphael</HI> do not affect us in any ex|traordinary
manner at fir&s;t &s;ight; his imitation
of nature is &s;o exact, that we contemplate it
at fir&s;t with as little &s;upri&s;e, as if we &s;aw the
real objects he repre&s;ents, that is to &s;ay, al|mo&s;t
without any. But the more we examine
the &s;ublime productions of that great arti&s;t,
the more our &s;urpri&s;e increa&s;es, until it ari&s;es
into a&s;toni&s;hment. In the work of an infe|rior
pencil we are immediately &s;truck with a
&s;ingular expre&s;&s;ion, a high colouring, a fan|ta&s;tick
attitude, becau&s;e we are not accu&s;tom|ed
to ob&s;erve them el&s;ewhere. We may
compare <HI>Raphael</HI> with <HI>Virgil;</HI> and the <HI>Vene|tian</HI>
painters, with their forced attitudes, may
be con&s;idered as the imitators of <HI>Lucan.
Virgil,</HI> more natural and &s;imple, &s;trikes le&s;s,
at fir&s;t view, than after an attentive examina|tion.
<HI>Lucan,</HI> on the contrary, &s;trikes at fir&s;t
view, and afterwards affects us little.</P>
<P>THE exact proportion, that is ob&s;erved in
the con&s;truction of the famous church of <HI>St.
Peter</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> makes it appear, at fir&s;t &s;ight,
le&s;s va&s;t and ample than it is in reality; for
we know not where to begin, nor on what
point we &s;hould fir&s;t fix our eye in order to
<PB N="303" REF="302">
judge of it's dimen&s;ions. Were it's breadth
le&s;s con&s;iderable, we &s;hould be immediately
&s;truck with it's length; and were it's length
dimini&s;hed, it's breadth would amaze us at
fir&s;t fight. But if it's va&s;t dimen&s;ions do not
&s;trike us with amazement at the moment that
we ca&s;t our eye upon the mighty fabrick, the
ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e when we &s;et about ex|amining
it with application and attention of
mind; then the eye perceives, as it were, the
noble &s;tructure expanding it&s;elf on all &s;ides;
and &s;urpri&s;e, gathering force from moment
to moment, throws the &s;oul, at length, into
the deepe&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment. Thus the travel|ler,
upon the fir&s;t view of the <HI>Pyrenean</HI>
mountains, imagines that his eye takes in
their whole extent; but as he advances he
perceives his error, &s;ees new &s;ummits ari&s;e,
and lo&s;es him&s;elf in the wide and endle&s;s
pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>IT often happens that the mind enjoys
plea&s;ure in con&s;equence of a feeling of which
it has no di&s;tinct notion, and which ari&s;es
from it's perceiving an object, as quite diffe|rent
from what it knows that object to be in
reality. The following example will abun|dantly
<PB N="304" REF="303">
illu&s;trate this ob&s;ervation. The cupo|la
of <HI>St. Peter's</HI> is of it&s;elf an immen&s;e edi|fice;
and it is well known that <HI>Michael An|gelo,</HI>
after an attentive view of the <HI>Pantheon,</HI>
which was the large&s;t of the <HI>Roman</HI> temples,
&s;aid that he would erect a &s;tructure of the
&s;ame kind, with this difference only, that it
&s;hould be built in the air. He executed, ac|cordingly,
the cupola of <HI>St. Peter's</HI> after the
model of the <HI>Pantheon;</HI> but ordered, at the
&s;ame time, the pillars which &s;upported it to
be made &s;o ma&s;&s;y, that the cupola, though,
in reality, of a mountainous &s;ize, appears
quite otherwi&s;e to the eye of the &s;pectator.
At the view therefore of this noble piece of
architecture the mind remains &s;u&s;pended be|tween
what it perceives, and what it knows,
between the appearance and the reality, and
cannot recover from the &s;urpri&s;e it feels at the
fight of an edifice, which is, at the &s;ame
time &s;o ma&s;&s;y and &s;o light.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning tho&s;e beauties that re&s;ult
from a certain embara&s;&s;ment and

<P>THE mind is frequently &s;truck with &s;ur|pri&s;e
from its not being able to reconcile the
pa&s;t with the pre&s;ent, what it &s;ees with what
it has &s;een. There is in <HI>Italy</HI> a va&s;t lake
called <HI>Il lago maggiore,</HI> who&s;e borders are
entirely wild and barren: but, upon &s;ailing
about fifteen miles in this little ocean, we find
two i&s;lands called the <HI>Borromees,</HI> about a
quarter of a mile in circumference; and in
the&s;e di&s;tingui&s;hed &s;pots nature &s;eems to have
lavi&s;hed all tho&s;e rural beauties that the mo&s;t
exuberant fancy can paint. The mind is a&s;|toni&s;hed
at this &s;ingular contra&s;t, and recalls
upon this occa&s;ion the plea&s;ure it has received
from the prodigies of romance, where the
reader is tran&s;ported from craggy rocks and
barren de&s;arts into &s;miling land&s;capes and en|chanted
ground.</P>
<P>ALL contra&s;ts &s;trike of nece&s;&s;ity, becau&s;e
objects placed in oppo&s;ition &s;et off each other
<PB N="306" REF="305">
reciprocally: thus a dwarf in company with
a per&s;on of a tall &s;tature forms a contra&s;t that
makes the latter appear more enormous, and
the former more minute.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e contra&s;ts &s;urpri&s;e; and hence
the plea&s;ure we receive from antithe&s;es, and
other &s;uch figures, and in general from all
tho&s;e beauties of nature and art that are pro|duced
or heightened by oppo&s;ition. When

Satricum <HI>and</HI> Corniculum <HI>were provinces:

Tibur, <HI>now our &s;uburbs, and</HI> Praene&s;te, <HI>where

&s;hews us at the &s;ame time the grandeur to

<P><PB N="307" REF="306">
WE may here ob&s;erve the remarkable dif|ference
there is between an antithe&s;is of
ideas, and an antithe&s;is merely of words.
The latter is glaring, the former lies in &s;ome
mea&s;ure concealed; the one is always in the
&s;ame form and dre&s;s, the other changes as
we plea&s;e; the one is diver&s;ified and com|plex,
the other is uniform and &s;imple.</P>
<P>The &s;ame hi&s;torian, &s;peaking of the <HI>Sam|nites,</HI>

could have furni&s;hed to the <HI>Romans</HI> the oc|ca&s;ions
of four and twenty triumphs, <HI>ut non

It is remarkable here that the
very &s;ame words, which intimate the de|&s;truction
of that conquered people, convey
to us an idea of their unparalleled ob&s;tinacy
and fortitude.</P>
<P>THE violence of a fit of laughter increa&s;es
in proportion to the pains we take to &s;tifle it;
becau&s;e there is then a &s;triking contra&s;t be|tween
the air and ge&s;tures we a&s;&s;ume, and
<PB N="308" REF="307">
tho&s;e that naturally corre&s;pond with the pre|&s;ent
frame and di&s;po&s;ition of our minds. In
the &s;ame manner we laugh at the &s;ight of an
enormous no&s;e, or any other remarkable de|fect
in a countenance, on account of the un|&s;eemly
contra&s;t which &s;uch a feature makes,
when compared with the re&s;t. Hence we
&s;ee that contra&s;ts are &s;ometimes the cau&s;es of
deformity, as well as of beauty. When they
are introduced without rea&s;on, or when they
only &s;erve to expo&s;e a defect and to place it
in a &s;triking and con&s;picuous point of view,
then they render an object deformed. <HI>De|formity</HI>
produces different effects upon the
mind, according to the ideas that are a&s;&s;ocia|ted

&s;tyle<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>French</HI> word <HI>naivet&eacute;,</HI> which &s;ignifies &s;implicity without meanne&s;s, is difficult to be expre&s;&s;ed without a peri|phra&s;is. We therefore wi&s;h that Mr. <HI>John&s;ton</HI> would admit <HI>naivity</HI> into his Dictionary.</NOTE>. The attainment of this is extremely
difficult, becau&s;e it lies between the &s;ublime
and it's oppo&s;ite, but &s;o near the latter, that it
is not ea&s;y to &s;teer along it's border without
touching it, or, to &s;peak without a figure, it
is difficult to maintain this &s;implicity of &s;tyle
without falling &s;ometimes into a low and
vulgar &s;train.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="309">
THE greate&s;t ma&s;ters in mu&s;ick acknow|ledge
that tho&s;e vocal-pieces which are per|formed
with the greate&s;t facility are always
the mo&s;t difficult in the compo&s;ition; a cer|tain
proof this, that there are limits pre&s;cribed
both to our plea&s;ures and to the art by which
they are produced.</P>
<P>When we read the pompous and lofty
&s;trains of <HI>Corneille,</HI> and the natural and flow|ing
ver&s;ification of <HI>Racine,</HI> we can &s;carcely
per&s;uade our&s;elves that the former compo&s;ed
with ea&s;e, and the latter with difficulty and
labour; yet &s;uch was really the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A LOW and in&s;ipid &s;tyle is the &s;ublime of
the multitude, who are plea&s;ed with &s;uch
productions as appear expre&s;&s;ly made for them,
and which are, at the &s;ame time, adapted to
their capacities.</P>
<P>THE ideas that ari&s;e in the minds of &s;uch
as are ble&s;&s;ed with elevation of genius im|proved
and directed by a liberal education, are
either natural<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Idies naives.</HI></NOTE>, noble, or &s;ublime.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="310">
WHEN an object is pre&s;ented to us under
various circum&s;tances or in acce&s;&s;ory points
of light that aggrandize it con&s;iderably, the
complex idea, then excited in the mind, may
be called noble. This is more e&s;pecially ob|&s;ervable
in compari&s;ons, in which the mind
mu&s;t always have it's perceptions augmented
and multiplied; for compari&s;ons mu&s;t, in
their nature, nece&s;&s;arily add &s;omething to
their objects, either by heightening our no|tions
of their grandeur, or of their elegance;
and &s;imilitudes taken from mean objects are
carefully to be avoided; for the mind, in&s;tead
of contemplating them with plea&s;ure, beholds
them with di&s;gu&s;t, and would have &s;tudiou&s;|ly
concealed them, had it fir&s;t di&s;covered
them.</P>
<P>WHEN the elegance or delicacy of any &s;ub|ject
is to be di&s;played, by &s;imilitudes or com|pari&s;ons,
the mind is more plea&s;ed with the
compari&s;ons that are formed between the qua|lities,
actions, and manners of the objects
than with tho&s;e that are drawn between the
objects them&s;elves; as when a hero is com|pared
<PB N="312" REF="311">
with a lion, a lady with a &s;tar, a &s;wift
runner with a &s;tag.</P>
<P><HI>MICHAEL ANGELO</HI> excelled in
giving an air of dignity to all the &s;ubjects that
exerci&s;ed his &s;ublime pencil. In his celebra|ted
<HI>Bacchus</HI> he has not followed the ignoble
<HI>manner</HI> of the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> painters, who repre|&s;ent
that deity in a &s;taggering attitude; for
this would have been un&s;uitable to the maje&s;|ty
of a god. He has drawn him, on the
contrary, firm upon his limbs, and in a &s;ted|dy
po&s;ture; but, at the &s;ame time, has diffu|&s;ed
through the whole countenance of the
jolly deity &s;uch a di&s;&s;olute gaiety and &s;uch an
exqui&s;ite air of plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction at the
&s;ight of the &s;parkling liquor which he pours
into his cup, as produces the mo&s;t agreeable
effect.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame admirable arti&s;t, in a piece
which repre&s;ents the pa&s;&s;ion of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and is
now in the gallery of <HI>Florence,</HI> has drawn
the <HI>Virgin</HI> &s;tanding in an erect po&s;ture, and
beholding the crucifixion of her &s;on without
&s;hedding a tear, or di&s;covering the lea&s;t mark
of affliction or pity. The &s;ublime painter
<PB N="313" REF="312">
&s;uppo&s;es her in&s;tructed in the grand my&s;tery
of redemption, and therefore makes her &s;up|port
this dreadful &s;pectacle with re&s;ignation
and greatne&s;s of &s;oul.</P>
<P>THERE is no production of <HI>Michael Ange|lo,</HI>
which does, not bear &s;ome marks of the
grandeur and elevation of his genius. There
is in his very &s;ketches that air of maje&s;ty,
which we find in tho&s;e lines which <HI>Virgil</HI>
has left unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P>THERE is a gallery at <HI>Mantoua,</HI> in which
<HI>Giulio Romano</HI> has repre&s;ented the giants thun|der-&s;truck
by <HI>Jupiter.</HI> In this celebrated
piece all the gods appear &s;eized with a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and terror, while <HI>Juno,</HI> with an air of
tranquillity and fortitude, fits near <HI>Jupiter,</HI>
and points out to him a giant who has e&s;caped
his bolts, and whom &s;he entreats to de&s;troy
with the re&s;t. By this the arti&s;t has given to
<HI>Juno</HI> an air of maje&s;ty, which rai&s;es her va&s;tly
above the other deities. We ob&s;erve al&s;o in the
&s;ame piece, that the terror painted in the looks
of the gods is greater or le&s;s, in proportion,
as their places are more or le&s;s di&s;tant from
<PB N="314" REF="313">
the throne of <HI>Jupiter.</HI> This is highly natu|ral;
&s;ince, in a battle, the proximity of the
victor is every way proper to di&s;pell the fears
of his troops.</P>
