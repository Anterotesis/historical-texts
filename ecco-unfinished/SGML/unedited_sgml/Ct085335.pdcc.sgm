<Q>This Tract is dedicated to <HI>Phillip</HI>, Earl of <HI>Arundell</HI>. The Author was a noted Town-writer of his Time; and publi&s;hed many Pamphlets of Entertainment in Pro&s;e and Ver&s;e. He was reputed Ma&s;ter of a clear and elegant Style, and numbered among the Improvers of our Language in tho&s;e Days. He could &s;hew a Variety of Reading upon any Subject, by his <HI>Allu&s;ions, Compari&s;ons</HI>, &amp;c. which he had ready upon all Occa&s;ions; but at la&s;t fell into irregular Cour&s;es of Life, which brought him to Want, Mi&s;ery, and Repentance. He died of a Surfeit upon pickled Herrings and <HI>Rheni&s;h</HI> Wine, on the Third of <HI>Septemb.</HI> in the Year 1592.

<Q>The Author, <HI>James Perrott</HI>, as he &s;igns him&s;elf at the End of his Dedication to <HI>Robert</HI>, Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>, was the natural Son of Sir <HI>John Perrot</HI>, Lord Deputy of <HI>Ireland</HI>. He was afterwards knighted, and a frequent Member of Parliament. This was the Au|thor's fir&s;t Publication (unknown to <HI>A. Wood.</HI>) It is di&s;creetly and learnedly handled, for a young Man of twenty-five Years of Age; and founded upon a &s;olid and loyal View of re&s;training tho&s;e dangerous Malecontents, whether Scholars, or Soldiers, who did, ma|ny of them, in his Time, turn Fugitives, and Renegades; &s;ettling them&s;elves in Foreign Countries, e&s;pecially under the Umbrage of <HI>Spain</HI>, to negotiate Con&s;piracies, Inva&s;ions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with their traiterous Corre&s;pondents in <HI>England</HI>. The Author died in 1636, hav|ing printed &s;ome other Pieces; but his <HI>Life of Sir Philip Sidney</HI> (never publi&s;hed) is mo&s;t de&s;ireable; and would in all Probability &s;et forth that gallant and accompli&s;hed Gentle|man's Virtues and Actions, in a more con|&s;picuous Light than does appear in the faint and inexpre&s;&s;ive Draught that has been left us by his great Friend, Sir <HI>Fulk Grevill</HI>.</Q>

<Q>It appears in the <HI>Preface</HI>, that the Author's Motives for publi&s;hing this <HI>Relation</HI> were, <HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, The Knowledge his Friends had of his being &s;pecially appointed an Attendant upon his Lord&s;hip in this Expedition; and his hav|ing made &s;ome Ob&s;ervation of the Particulars in the &s;ame. <HI>Secondly</HI>, Becau&s;e &s;ome fal&s;e Re|ports had been made of their Entertainment in <HI>Spain</HI>, and of their Proceedings there.

And, at the End of the Preface, the Author appears to be <HI>Robert Tre&s;well</HI>, alias, <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> Herald. It is a &s;carce Piece, and has not, perhaps, been &s;ufficiently made U&s;e of, to &s;et forth the Hi&s;tory of this Part of King <HI>James</HI> his Reign, in its due Colours.

<Q>This was the mo&s;t violent <HI>Storm</HI> in the Memory of Man, or that ever was, per|haps, in <HI>England</HI>. It began on <HI>Friday</HI> Night, about Eleven o' Clock (not on <HI>Saturday</HI> Morning, as this Pamphlet &s;ays) <HI>November</HI> 26, 1703, and continued till Seven o' Clock next Morning. This Tract is as full of Particulars as its Compa&s;s will admit; but it is probable, the greate&s;t Part of the Da|mages were never regi&s;tered. This Author thinks the <HI>Fire of London</HI> was not &s;o con&s;i|derable a Misfortune. Indeed that was li|mited to a narrow Space, in Compari&s;on of this; which extended over the <HI>Sea</HI>, as well as all the <HI>Land</HI>. Among the Accidents; it was an odd one that befell Mr. <HI>Hemp&s;on</HI>; who was blown out of an upper Room in the <HI>Bell-&s;avage</HI> Inn upon <HI>Ludgate-Hill</HI> a|&s;leep; and knew nothing of the <HI>Storm</HI>, till he found him&s;elf lying on his <HI>Bed</HI> in the o|pen <HI>Street</HI>.

<Q>The fir&s;t of the&s;e <HI>Speeches</HI>, which only we can have Room here to take Notice of, was occa&s;ioned by a Bill, brought into the Hou&s;e, in which <HI>Cambridge</HI> was mentioned <HI>before Oxford</HI>; which rai&s;ed &s;ome Debates in <HI>January</HI> 1640, about placing one Word before the other. Whereupon Sir <HI>Simonds D'ewes</HI> undertook to prove, in this Speech, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> was a renowned City, 500 Years before there was an Hou&s;e &s;tanding in <HI>Oxford</HI>; and that (without regarding <HI>Twine</HI>'s Allegations, for the Antiquity of <HI>Oxford</HI>; or tho&s;e of <HI>Caius</HI>, for that of <HI>Cam|bridge</HI>; mo&s;t Part of which he accounts but <HI>Deliria Senum</HI>) from <HI>Gildas Albanius</HI>'s <HI>Bri|ti&s;h</HI> Story, who died about the Year 520. And from a <HI>Saxon</HI> anonymous Story in <HI>La|tin</HI>, who&s;e Author lived in the Reign of <HI>Penda</HI> King of the <HI>Mercians</HI>, about the Year 620. And from <HI>Nennius</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Bri|tain</HI>, wrote in the Year 880. Who all call <HI>Cambridge, Cair-grant</HI>: Which Word <HI>Cair</HI>, in the old <HI>Celtique</HI> Tongue, &s;ignifies a City. And <HI>Cair grant</HI> is not only expounded by <HI>Alfred</HI> of <HI>Beverly</HI> to &s;ignify <HI>Cambridge</HI>, but by <HI>William de Ram&s;ey, Abbot</HI> of <HI>Croyland</HI>, in his Life of <HI>Guthlac</HI>; who &s;ays further, it was &s;o called a <HI>Granta flumine</HI>. And though it &s;uffered great Deva&s;tations by the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Incur&s;ions, it is, in <HI>Dome&s;dei</HI> Book, de&s;cri|bed as a Place of con&s;iderable Moment; ha|ving in it <HI>Decem Cu&s;todias</HI>, and a <HI>Ca&s;tle</HI> of great Strength and Extent. Thus much for the Antiquity of the Place; this Author next lays it down, that <HI>Cambridge</HI> was a <HI>Nur|&s;ery</HI> for <HI>Learning</HI>, before <HI>Oxford</HI> was known to have a <HI>Grammar School</HI> in it. But to prove it, begins no higher than King <HI>Alfred</HI>'s Time, for the Gathering of Per&s;ons to &s;tudy Arts and Sciences there: He further ob&s;erves it was &s;o famous a Seminary of In&s;truction in <HI>William</HI> the <HI>Norman</HI>'s Reign, that he &s;ent his Son <HI>Henry</HI> thither, afterwards the fir&s;t of that Name, King of <HI>England</HI>; who, for the uncommon Knowledge he acquired, was &s;irnamed <HI>Beauclerk</HI>. He adds that the mo&s;t ancient and fir&s;t endowed College of <HI>Eng|land</HI>, was <HI>Valence College</HI> in <HI>Cambridge</HI>; which after the Foundation, as appears by a <HI>Par|liament</HI> Roll in the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>London, Anno</HI> 38 <HI>Hen.</HI> VI.

To the fir&s;t and &s;econd of the&s;e, that is, the <HI>Ballance</HI>, and <HI>Agrarian</HI>, you made no Objection; and therefore I &s;hould not need to make an An&s;wer: But for the Third, I mean <HI>Rotation</HI>, which you im|plicitly reject, in your De&s;ign to perpe|tuate the pre&s;ent Members, I &s;hall only add this, to what I have already &s;aid and written on that Subject: That a <HI>Common-wealth</HI> is like a great <HI>Top</HI>, that mu&s;t be kept up by being whipped round, and held in perpetual <HI>Circulation</HI>; for, if you di&s;|continue the <HI>Rotation</HI>, and &s;uffer the Se|nate to &s;ettle, and &s;tand &s;till, down it falls immediately. And, if you had &s;tudied this Point, as carefully as I have done, you could not but know, there is no &s;uch Way under Heaven of di&s;po&s;ing the Vici&s;&s;itudes of Command and Obedience, and of di&s;|tributing <HI>equal</HI> Right and Liberty among all Men, as this of <HI>Wheeling</HI>; by which, as <HI>Chaucer</HI> writes, a &s;ingle Fart hath been divided among a whole Covent of Friars, and every one hath had his ju&s;t Share of &endq;the Savour.</Q>

<Q>&startq;Now if this be true, that a Man may be killed for &s;ix, or &s;even <HI>Duckets</HI>, or for &s;uch a &s;light Thing as an <HI>Apple</HI>; then certainly might our <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> judge a Man to Death, for my Lord <HI>Cottington</HI>'s E&s;tate.

<Q>By this <HI>Engli&s;h Heroe</HI>, is meant General <HI>Monk</HI>, Duke of <HI>Albemarle</HI>, who died the foregoing Year. And had the <HI>Cloud</HI> been <HI>opened</HI>, as is here promi&s;ed, by which &s;ome might think to be intended the My&s;tery of the <HI>Re&s;toration</HI>; wherein that General ap|peared the leading Figure, we might have had a very &s;atisfactory Sight: But that Ex|pre&s;&s;ion is more confined to the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> him|&s;elf; who was of a clo&s;e and <HI>cloudy</HI> Di&s;po&s;i|tion, much inclined to <HI>Secrecy</HI>, and wrapped in <HI>Re&s;ervation</HI>. And, indeed, in the Man|ner of Setting him forth, the <HI>Author</HI> is much corre&s;pondent to his <HI>Subject</HI>; is &s;o much in|volved in Allu&s;ions and Digre&s;&s;ions, that the greate&s;t Part of the Work is a dark, de|tached Rhap&s;ody of Reflections. Yet are there &s;ome curious <HI>Anecdotes</HI>, in <HI>Charac|ters</HI> of <HI>Per&s;ons</HI>, and <HI>Remarks</HI> on the <HI>late Times</HI>, &s;prinkled up and down, e&s;pecially concerning General <HI>Monk</HI>, no where el&s;e to be met with; and in which the Au|thor does maintain his Title of <HI>a Loyal and Impartial Pen</HI>. As where he mentions that Tradition of the <HI>General</HI>'s Promi&s;e, <HI>Ne|ver to bear Arms in England again&s;t his Prince</HI>.
<Q>&startq;This, &s;ays our Author, not a few will have mo&s;t exactly to be perform|ed; and hence by no Action of his Loy|alty to be impeached. What he acted in the fir&s;t <HI>Dutch</HI> Engagement, and what was performed in the <HI>Caledoman</HI> War, mu&s;t, by a milder Glo&s;s, be interpreted a Zeal for his Country, and no Di&s;affection to his King; but the more rigid Cen&s;ors will not allow him, who wounds in <HI>Hands</HI> and <HI>Feet</HI>, no Enemy, though not equally mortal with him who tran&s;pierces &endq;the <HI>Heart</HI>.</Q>
He &s;ays further: The <HI>Low Country</HI> Religion obliged him to a <HI>Party</HI>; by whom he was di&s;obliged: That he honour|ably de&s;erted his De&s;erters; and intimates, that the <HI>Juncto</HI>, who made him a Cypher in Commi&s;&s;ion, contributed thereby to vote to their own Ruin; and when he broke down the <HI>City</HI> Gates, he &s;aid, he then thought him&s;elf even with them. His dreadle&s;s Re|gard of <HI>Plague</HI> and <HI>War</HI>, is imputed to a <HI>Prede&s;tinarian</HI> Principle. He violently pro|&s;ecuted the <HI>Dutch</HI> War, in which he ex|ceeded his Commi&s;&s;ion; brought the Nati|on many Millions in Debt, and, had he been a <HI>Dutchman</HI>, might have lo&s;t him his Head: Whereas,
<Q>&startq;by the Method he &s;eem|ed to <HI>re&s;tore</HI>, he might have <HI>&s;ecured</HI> his Country: Here, a <HI>Fal$us</HI>, he might have effected by <HI>Delays</HI>, what he could not by <HI>Fighting</HI>; and have &s;eemed a double <HI>Re|&s;torer</HI> of his Nation, who&s;e Ra&s;hne&s;s might &endq;have intitled him the <HI>Demoli&s;her</HI>.</Q>
The Reports he gives us of the <HI>General</HI>'s <HI>Fr$g$li|ty</HI>, or, in Truth, <HI>Sordidne&s;s</HI>; his introducing Board-wages at Court; &s;aving Half, in his own daily Allowance; cau&s;ing Fowl$, that were uncarved at his Table one Day, to be new roa&s;ted, and re-vi&s;it it the next; and his menacing an only Child with Di&s;i$he|riting, for expending five Shillings at a Sup|per, might &s;eem incredible, in a Man who had taken &s;uch liberal Views of Life, and had &s;uch high Honours, profitable Po&s;ts, and va&s;t Trea&s;ures accumulated upon him, if other Authors, who knew him, had not written to the like Purpo&s;e. But, upon the Account of his <HI>Credulity</HI> in the Cures of of <HI>Greatrakes</HI> the <HI>Stroaker</HI>, and Patronage of him, the Ignorance of that illiterate Quack and Impo&s;tor, as he is now plainly called, and &s;eems di&s;covered to be, is more expatia|ted upon, than any other Circum&s;tance in the whole Tract. As our Author, before, had not contradicted the A&s;&s;ertion, That his Heroe's <HI>Head-piece</HI> was the wor&s;t Part of his <HI>Armour:</HI> So now, his &s;trong Faith in this gracious Babe of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Refor|mation, is repre&s;ented as a great Weak|ne&s;s; e&s;pecially in that In&s;tance, of his &s;end|ing this <HI>Stroaker</HI> to a &s;uperannuated Wo|man of <HI>Ninety</HI>, who had lo&s;t her <HI>Hearing</HI> twelve Years, in Expectation, b$ his Hand, to recover it.

B.</HI> it is particularized by what Toys, Trifles, and unnece&s;&s;ary Wares tran&s;port|ed from <HI>France</HI> into <HI>England</HI>, they re|ceive of us the <HI>yearly</HI> Value of above <HI>Six and twenty-hundred-thou&s;and Pounds</HI>; and that, by the Commodities exported from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>France</HI>, we receive not above <HI>Ten hundred-thou&s;and Pounds a Year</HI> of them: So that our Trade with <HI>France</HI> is at lea&s;t <HI>Sixteeen-hun|dred thou&s;and Pounds per Annum</HI> clear Lo&s;s to this Kingdom. The Author propo&s;es many Ways whereby we may recover this Lo&s;s, and retrieve our&s;elves, if our infatuating In|dolence will give us Leave. Otherwi&s;e <HI>France</HI> will continue to flouri&s;h by our Sloth, to grow wi&s;e by our Folly, proud by our Exce&s;s, and powerful by our Trea&s;ure, till they become our De&s;truction. For as the middle Region of the Air is wont to frame its Thunder, Hail, and other Meteors again&s;t the Earth, out of the Exhalations it draws from the Earth: So <HI>France</HI>, out of the Riches it gathers from <HI>England</HI>, and other neighbouring Dominions, rai&s;es formidable Armies and potent Fleets to invade them.</Q>

<Q>This <HI>Poem</HI>, which was printed in the Year 1593, is written in Lines of ten Syllables, without Rhime; or what we call <HI>blank Ver&s;e</HI>.

he remembers the <HI>Origin</HI> of the <HI>Order</HI>, according to the common Tradition of a <HI>Lady's Garter drop'd in a Dance</HI>, and taken up by that King; but conceived to be the <HI>Queen</HI>'s by our Author. Then he di&s;cerns all that glorious Company to be the <HI>Fir&s;t Founders</HI>, who came down thither to grace this <HI>In&s;tallation</HI>; among them the <HI>Black Prince</HI>, on a Coal-black Cour&s;er, his Cor&s;let varni&s;hed as black as Jet, his Ba&s;es black, with a Battle-Ax in his Hand; and all, from Head to Foot, as black as Night. (And in &s;uch &s;able Armour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he is to be &s;een in &s;ome ancient Illuminations on Vellum, re|pre&s;enting him in the Wars of <HI>France</HI>.) Yet makes our Poet this Di&s;tinction:
<Q><L>Though <HI>Black</HI> of Hue, that <HI>Surname</HI> yet in <HI>Fraunce</HI></L>
<L>He <HI>wan:</HI> For Terror to the <HI>Frenchmen</HI>'s Hearts</L>
<L>His <HI>Count'nance</HI> was; his <HI>Sword,</HI> an iron Scourge.</L></Q>
At la&s;t, our Author attaining a View, in this airy Proce&s;&s;ion, of King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. and his warlike Band of this Order; he e&s;|pied, written in the <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Fame</HI>, the Name of <HI>Francis</HI> Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> (&s;ome few Years before decea&s;ed) of whom, after &s;ome high Encomiums, he tells this Story: That, once walking out alone, this aged Earl was overtaken with Sleep, and laid him&s;elf down to Re&s;t near a Farmer's Lodge. He was wrapped in a plain ru&s;&s;et Cloak; but it covered not the Badge of Honour which was buckled round his Leg, &s;o that it tempted a young thievi&s;h Vagrant, who pa&s;&s;ed by, to en|deavour at Taking it off. The Earl was not &s;o fa&s;t a&s;leep, but he &s;oon perceived the De|&s;ign, and offered him a better Prize; for his <HI>Garter</HI> would not fit every Leg, and he e&s;teemed it better than his <HI>Pur&s;e</HI>. The Thief, affrighted, ran away; and the Earl would plea&s;antly tell his Friends, The Rogue would not have dared to &s;teal the <HI>Garter</HI>, if he had under&s;tood the <HI>French</HI> about it. Next comes on Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>, and her &s;tately Train of gartered Knights, in great Pomp and Glory; and King <HI>Edward</HI> con|gratulates tho&s;e <HI>Five</HI> e&s;pecially, who had this Day the Honour to be created by the &s;aid Queen; that is to &s;ay, the Earls of <HI>Northum|berland</HI>, and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI>; the Lords <HI>Boroughe</HI>, and <HI>Sh$ffi$lde</HI>; and Sir <HI>Francis Knolles</HI>. And, after that King has given Characters of their Virtues, and Exhortations to proceed in them, <HI>Renown</HI> founded a Retreat: The <HI>Train</HI>, as &s;wift as &s;hooting Stars, retired, <HI>Fame</HI>'s double Doors fell to, and the gay <HI>Morn</HI> wak'd from her golden Sleep. The Author, in his <HI>Epilogue</HI>, tells that Earl, to whom he addre&s;&s;es the <HI>Prologue</HI>, that he offers this Dream as the Fir&s;tling of his Scholar's Crop, con&s;ecrated to his Noble Name. O|ther <HI>Poetical Pieces</HI> of his were printed the &s;ame Year; e&s;pecially in the <HI>Dramatic</HI> Way; and &s;ome <HI>Pa&s;toral</HI> Pieces of his were printed in <HI>England</HI>'s <HI>Helicon</HI>. But the Tragedy of <HI>Alphon&s;us</HI> Emperor of <HI>Germany</HI>, was <HI>Chap|man</HI>'s. Tis true, as <HI>A. Wood</HI> ob&s;erves, that, mo&s;t Poets dying ob&s;curely, it is hard to trace them to their Graves; and he was mi&s;led in &s;etting down this Poet, to be flou|ri&s;hing after his Death, from the Dates of &s;ome of his Writings which were then print|ed: For we are a&s;&s;ured by one of his Con|temporaries, that he fell a Victim in the <HI>Wars of Venus</HI>, in, or before the Year 1598. And might then be about Forty, or a Middle-aged Man.</Q>

<Q>The Author of this curious and u&s;eful Tract, dedicates it to Sir <HI>Edmond Ander&s;on</HI>, Knight, Lord Chief Ju&s;tice of the Common Pleas; conceiving his Lord&s;hip might take &s;ome Delight in <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> of this Kind; as having lately permitted Mr. <HI>George Chur|chey</HI> to dedicate to him, his Tran&s;lation from the <HI>Latin</HI>, of <HI>Jacobus Dubravius</HI>, his <HI>New Book of Hu&s;bandry, treating of Fi&s;hponds</HI>, &amp;c.

And doubts not, but he &s;hall, in this little Treati&s;e, find &s;omething that he knew not before. In his <HI>Preface</HI>, he ob&s;erves, concerning <HI>Fi&s;h</HI>, that none have written thereof, in our Tongue, to any Purpo&s;e, whom he ever &s;aw; and that the &s;aid Tran&s;lation, compiled by a Stranger, and rendered into <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> by a
<PB N="60" REF="60">
Per&s;on of no great Experience, will not &s;a|tisfy the De&s;ires of tho&s;e who would prac|ti&s;e this Way to Improvement. That, for him&s;elf, he means not to expre&s;s all that might be &s;aid in the&s;e Matters, but only what he has ob&s;erved and practi&s;ed; for, if he &s;hould &s;et down, by Way of Preface, the great Benefits that might grow to this Realm, by practi&s;ing to have Abundance of the two fore&s;aid Commodities, the Preface would grow a greater Volume than the Book. Concerning <HI>Fruit</HI>, he &s;ays, though many Authors have more learnedly written, yet, many of them being Strangers, inhabiting Climates far differing from ours, they mo&s;t|ly teach how &s;uch Fruits, as their Countries bring forth, are to be u&s;ed; of which Kinds we have little or no U&s;e. That, if the Be|nefit ari&s;ing to the Commonwealth through Abundance of Fruit were well weighed, there would be Laws e&s;tabli&s;hed for the In|crea&s;e and Maintenance of it. That <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter&s;hire, Hereford&s;hire, Worce&s;ter&s;hire</HI>, great Part of <HI>Kent</HI>, and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>, are &s;o &s;tored, as to yield the Poor Meat and Drink, great Part of the Year. That he has known, in tho&s;e Counties, many Men, who had twelve or twenty Per&s;ons in Family, not u&s;e, mo&s;t Years, two Quarters of Malt in Drink, but o$ly <HI>Cider</HI> and <HI>Perry</HI>; and &s;ell yearly, be|&s;ides, great Quantities.

<Q>There is a wooden Print of Old <HI>Parr</HI>, in a black Cap, and &s;itting in a Chair, fa|cing this Title-page, The <HI>Life</HI> is written in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>; and it is dedicated to King <HI>Charles</HI> in Ver&s;e, by the &s;aid <HI>John Taylor</HI>; who, be|ing one of his Maje&s;ty's Watermen, is u&s;u|ally &s;tiled the <HI>Water-Poet</HI>. He informs the King, that as he had had the <HI>Greate&s;t</HI>, the <HI>Lea&s;t</HI>, and the <HI>Olde&s;t</HI> of his Subjects, at his Court, meaning <HI>William Evans</HI>, his Gi|gantick Porter; little <HI>Jeffrey</HI>, the Queen's Dwarf; and this <HI>Thomas Parr</HI>; he cho&s;e the latter, for the Subject of his Mu&s;e; and begs his Maje&s;ty's Acceptance of this De&s;cription of his Life, as he had received and read others of his Poems. If we were to draw the chief Circum&s;tances expre&s;&s;ed in the &s;aid <HI>Poem</HI>, and the preliminary Di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>, into a regular Order, and join the <HI>Chronology</HI>, it might render the Story more compleat: And &s;o it would appear, That, living with his Father <HI>John Parr</HI>, a Hu&s;|bandman at <HI>Winnington</HI> afore&s;aid, till he was &s;eventeen Years old, he was, in 1500, &s;ent to Service, under a Ma&s;ter of the &s;ame Cal|ling, with whom he dwelt, till the Death of his Father, about 1518; then, returning Home, re&s;ided upon the Farm, or Lands, he left him in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, till the Lea&s;e expired in 1522. He then renewed the Lea&s;e for Twenty-one Years, of Mr. <HI>Lewis Porter</HI>; and when this ended, in 1543, he renewed it, a &s;econd Time, for the &s;ame Term, of Mr. <HI>John Porter</HI>. In 1563, old <HI>Parr</HI>, being then <HI>Four&s;core Years of Age</HI>, married <HI>Jane</HI>, Daughter of <HI>John Taylor</HI>, a Maid; by whom he had a Son, and a Daugh|ter, named <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Joan</HI>, who both died very young. The next Year, 1564, his &s;econd Lea&s;e ending, he renewed, for the like Term, of Mr. <HI>Hugh Porter</HI>. In 1585, ended his <HI>third</HI> Lea&s;e; and he took a <HI>Lea&s;e</HI>, for <HI>Life</HI>, of <HI>John</HI> the Son of <HI>Hugh Porter</HI>. In 1588, being then aged <HI>One-hundred and five Years</HI>, and having a Colt's Tooth in his Head, he did Penance in a <HI>White Sheet</HI>, in <HI>Alberbury</HI> Church, for Lying with a hand|&s;ome Woman, named <HI>Katherine Milton</HI>, and, as it is here &s;ugge&s;ted, getting her with Child. Upon which Penance, &s;ays our Poet,
<Q><L>Should all, that &s;o offend, &s;uch Penance do,</L>
<L>O! What a Price would <HI>Linnen</HI> ri&s;e unto!</L></Q>
In 1595, he buried his Wife <HI>Jane</HI>; after they had lived together Thirty-two Years. Having continued a Widower ten Years, and, being now <HI>One-hundred Twenty-two Years of Age</HI>, he married, in the Year 1605, <HI>Jane</HI> the Widow of <HI>Anthony Adda</HI>, Daugh|ter of <HI>John Loyde</HI>, of the Pari&s;h of <HI>Gill&s;els</HI>, in <HI>Montgomery Shire</HI> in <HI>Wales</HI>; and they li|ved thirty Years together. But now, think|ing that Time might dimini&s;h the Strength of his <HI>Tenement</HI>, as it had increa&s;ed the Va|lue of his <HI>Tenure</HI>, he was, for his Wife's Sake, de&s;irous to renew his <HI>Lea&s;e</HI> for Years; which was not complied with, though he politickly counterfeited the Renewal of his <HI>Age</HI>, by pretending to &s;ee, who had been long blind, a Pin on the Floor, which ha|ving directed his Wife to lay there, he bid her, take up, in Pre&s;ence of his Landlord's Son, Mr. <HI>Edward Porter</HI>, with whom it pa&s;&s;ed as a plea&s;ant Conceit, but it had no Effect. Soon after, <HI>Thomas</HI> Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI>, a great Lover of Antiquities, vi&s;iting an E&s;tate of his, in tho&s;e Parts, was led by the Fame of this great Curio&s;ity, this <HI>Thomas de Temporibus</HI>, to vi&s;it him. He took him into his Protection, and, having prevailed on him to &s;ee <HI>London</HI>, ordered a Litter with two Hor&s;es for his Carriage; and being attended by his Daughter-in-Law, named <HI>Lucy, John the $word$</HI>, and a Servant of his Lord&s;hip's,

named <HI>Brian Kelley</HI>, who defrayed their Ex|pences on the Road, they &s;et out from <HI>Win|nington:</HI> But, when they arrived at <HI>Coventry</HI>, the Multitude of People grew &s;o great and pre&s;&s;ing, to behold this breathing Monument, that <HI>Kelley</HI> was afraid he &s;hould be able to carry his Charge no further. At la&s;t, with &s;low Marches, they arrived &s;afe at <HI>London</HI>, about the End of <HI>September</HI>, 1635. King <HI>Charles</HI> having had Certificates from the Gentry of <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> of the Lea&s;es afore&s;aid, and other Particulars, proving <HI>Thomas Parr</HI>, to be the <HI>Elde&s;t Son</HI> of <HI>Time</HI>, alive; he was admitted to Court, admired with great Ve|neration, and had the Honour to ki&s;s his Maje&s;ty's Hand, Care was taken to accom|modate him with all Conveniences, in a Lodging provided for him at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>: But the Change agreed not; he had breath|ed in a freer Air, fed on &s;impler Diet, nor had been u&s;ed to &s;uch Throngs of Vi&s;itors. All which, though now grown very decri|pid, &s;o as not to walk, without two Per&s;ons to &s;upport him, and having only one Tooth left in his Head, not his <HI>Colt's Tooth</HI> before|mentioned, might ha&s;ten his natural Decay; and he at la&s;t paid the Debt of Nature like other Men, though it was longer delayed, in the Middle of <HI>November</HI> following; after he had been, little more than &s;ix Weeks, re|moved to the City afore&s;aid, as appears in the Title-page above; and he was decently buried in the <HI>Abbey</HI>.

<Q>The&s;e <HI>Soap-boilers</HI> appear to have under|gone a tedious, expen&s;ive, and cruel Per&s;ecu|tion, by tho&s;e Courtiers, who had procured a Patent to &s;upplant them, and engro&s;s their Bu&s;ine&s;s. After twenty or thirty Freemen of the Trade had, for many Years, carried it on quietly, two Patents were granted to <HI>And. Palmer</HI>, and <HI>Rog.

Stradling</HI>, and others; who, in <HI>December</HI>, 1631, procured a Grant to make <HI>Hard</HI>, and <HI>Soft-&s;oap</HI>, for fourteen Years. Soon after, Sir <HI>H. Comp|ton</HI>, Sir <HI>H.

From the&s;e &s;pecious Overtures of tho&s;e <HI>Monopoli&s;ts</HI>, through that Grant, aro&s;e much Lo&s;s to the Crown, and great Grie|vance to the regular Trade&s;men afore&s;aid. For fir&s;t the King allowed <HI>Five-thou&s;and Pounds</HI> to Sir <HI>John Bourchier</HI> and <HI>Jones</HI>, for their Expences in the Project; and the Cor|poration, finding the new <HI>White-Soap</HI>, after all their Artifices, would not vend, to di&s;|able the <HI>London Soap-makers</HI>, from affording to &s;ell <HI>theirs</HI> at the Price by <HI>the&s;e</HI> propo&s;ed, procured a Proclamation that no Soap &s;hould be &s;old, made with <HI>Fi&s;h Oyl</HI>, but only that of <HI>Olives</HI> or <HI>Rape</HI>; &s;o that all the old <HI>Soap-makers</HI> Stock lay upon their Hands.

In the End, they were all <HI>fined</HI>, from Five-hundred, to Fif|teen-hundred Pounds a Man; and <HI>impri&s;on|ed</HI>; mo&s;t, for ten, one for near twelve Months; that is, from the 10th of <HI>May</HI>, 1633, to the 6th of <HI>April</HI>, 1634, and two of them <HI>died</HI> in that <HI>Re&s;traint</HI>. Then came Orders to <HI>e&s;treat</HI> the <HI>Fines</HI>; and <HI>Extents</HI> were i&s;&s;ued upon their <HI>Goods</HI>; they were di&s;|abled to u&s;e their Trade, and others made Soap with their Materials. The <HI>We&s;tmin|&s;ter</HI> Soapers had <HI>Licence</HI>, upon the Badne&s;s of their <HI>White-Soap</HI>, to make old Soap, with Fi&s;h Oyl, for which tho&s;e of <HI>London</HI> had been &s;entenced; and, again&s;t their own De|cree, to &s;ell it at a Penny in the Pound dear|er, than Soap of the like Goodne&s;s was u&s;u|ally &s;old for before, by the <HI>London</HI> Soap-ma|kers; and warranted one of the <HI>Sixteen</HI> afore|&s;aid, to make that Soap for them, again&s;t his own Covenant to the Contrary; and or|dered that none &s;hould buy any, but of this Corporation. Officers were impowered to enter all Hou&s;es, and carry off all Soap un|marked; break down Pans, Fatts, Ci&s;terns, &amp;c. Drove many to Flight in the Country, beyond Sea, &amp;c. At length, after this Cor|poration had &s;pent <HI>One-hundred and Fifteen-thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Soap-making, Salaries, Law, &amp;c. and vexed the whole Kingdom, for <HI>three Years</HI>, and u&s;urped the Soap-makers Trade, <HI>one Year</HI> and a <HI>Quarter</HI>, they ob|tained a Grant from the King, of <HI>Forty-thou&s;and Pounds</HI>, for Surrendering their Pa|tent, and <HI>Three-thou&s;and Pounds</HI> for Charges of their Hou&s;es, paid them by the <HI>London</HI> Soap makers; who were al&s;o obliged to take off their Materials, at their own Rates, a|mounting to above <HI>Twenty-thou&s;and Pounds</HI> more; be&s;ides <HI>Five-hundred Pounds</HI>, for not meddling with the <HI>Soap-makers</HI> Hou&s;es: And all this, only to have the U&s;e of their Trade again. Then the King incorporated the <HI>London Soap makers</HI>; and though tho&s;e of <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had paid him but <HI>four Pounds per</HI> Tun, and, for a &s;hort Time, <HI>&s;ix Pounds</HI>; the&s;e of <HI>London</HI>, without any Liberty of rai|&s;ing the Price, were obliged to pay <HI>eight Pounds</HI> the Tun; which, in about three Years, amounted to above <HI>Ninety-thou&s;and Pounds</HI>. Thus &s;uffered they, by <HI>Fines, Im|pri&s;onments, Ejectments, Spoil</HI> and <HI>Plunder</HI>, from <HI>June</HI> 1632, to <HI>May</HI> 1637, near five Years, to the Ruin of many, for their In|compliance with the intolerable U&s;urpations of tho&s;e <HI>Knights, E&s;quires</HI>, and <HI>Gentlemen</HI>. Wherefore, it is here, as rea&s;onably, as it is humbly de&s;ired, That the &s;aid Patentees may be puni&s;hed, and make the Sufferers full Recompence: That the Commodity may be reduced to its accu&s;tomed Price; and none &s;uffered to u&s;e the Trade, but &s;uch as have been brought up, and are &s;killed in it.</Q>

That this Ne|gotiation of tho&s;e <HI>Nuncio's</HI> was written by the <HI>Venetian</HI> Amba&s;&s;ador, may be read al&s;o in Dr. <HI>Heylyn's Life</HI> of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Laud</HI>, Page 388. That Dr. <HI>Gregorio Panzani</HI>, a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, arrived in <HI>London</HI>, the Twenty-fifth of <HI>December</HI>, 1634, to move that a <HI>Catholick Bi&s;hop</HI> might re&s;ide in <HI>England</HI>, under cer|tain Limitations, to moderate the Differences between the Secular and Regular Clergy and the Je&s;uits. But hearing what Di&s;turbance Dr. <HI>Smith</HI>, Bi&s;hop of <HI>Chalcedon</HI>, had made among them, by Conte&s;ting for the Power of <HI>Ordinary</HI> over all <HI>England</HI>, to the Driving him into <HI>France</HI>; and as the Oath of Allegi|ance could not be allowed of by the Pope, Seignior <HI>Panzani</HI> was advi&s;ed to drop that Scheme, and procure the Allowance of a <HI>Nuncio</HI> to come to the <HI>Queen</HI>, by whom the Courts, that is, the Religions might be reconciled. Accordingly, here arrived, in <HI>July</HI>, 1636, as the Pope's Re&s;ident, Seignior <HI>George Con</HI>, a <HI>Scotchman</HI>, Secretary for the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue to Cardinal <HI>Barbarini</HI>, who was &s;plendidly received, but it was believed by our Author, he would not effectually &s;ucceed, becau&s;e he ingratiated too much with the Je&s;uits;
<Q>&startq;which if the Court perceive &s;ays he, may dimini&s;h the good Opinion, which is now conceived of him.

His whole Book is a <HI>Rap|&s;ody</HI> of Notes, and &s;cattered Papers, from other Men, collected without either <HI>Order</HI> or <HI>Method</HI>; being exceedingly defective, both in <HI>Time, Place</HI>, and <HI>Nomination</HI>; and written in &s;o un&s;eemly and disjointed a <HI>Stile</HI>, that you may ea&s;ily perceive he hath taken up other Men's <HI>Words</HI>, without under&s;tanding their <HI>Matter</HI>; and, unle&s;s it be where he rails on Per&s;ons of Honour, which he doth <HI>plainly</HI>, and <HI>often</HI>, though &s;ometimes very fal&s;ly, his Language is &endq;dark, har&s;h, and unintelligible.</Q>
Further this intelligent Author, being acquainted with mo&s;t of the eminent Per&s;onages which are by <HI>Sander&s;on</HI> &s;o much disfigured and tra|duced, had great Advantages as well as In|clination to rectify their Stories and do Ju&s;|tice to Truth: In doing which, he has ac|quainted us with &s;ome curious Pieces of &s;e|cret Hi&s;tory, whereof all other Writers have been &s;ilent. Particularly, it was here fir&s;t made known, why Sir <HI>Walter Ralegh</HI> is &s;o partially treated by <HI>Sander&s;on</HI>, becau&s;e his Father pretending <HI>Ralegh</HI> owed him much Money, and it being brought to Trial, he was found <HI>Ralegh</HI>'s Debtor in very great Sums, for which he died in Pri&s;on. Here are al&s;o &s;ome A&s;per&s;ions wiped off from the Memory of Queen <HI>Eli&s;abeth</HI>; others ca&s;t on the Noble Hou&s;e of <HI>Pembroke</HI>, upon Sir <HI>T. Overbury, Hen.

<Q>The Author, who was a Practitioner in Phy&s;ick, and a Native of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>, dedicates this his ingenious Treati&s;e to K. <HI>Charles</HI>. There are many entertaining Remarks, ma|ny Philo&s;ophical and Hi&s;torical Illu&s;trations, as well as good Medicinal Pre&s;criptions in it, relating to the Cau&s;es and Cures of all de&s;tructive <HI>Contagions</HI>; e&s;pecially that which then raged in this Nation: And there may al&s;o be &s;ome few In&s;tances of his being led a little into <HI>Credulity</HI> by the Authorities of &s;ome Writers, otherwi&s;e, or for the Gene|rality of good Credit; as where he treats of <HI>Amulets</HI> and e&s;pecially <HI>Witches</HI>.

Among his <HI>Progno&s;ticks</HI>, the Re|mark he makes, from <HI>Simon Kelway</HI> and others, that <HI>Children</HI>, Mimicking Funerals, Armies, and Battles, predict <HI>Mortalities</HI> and <HI>Civil Wars</HI>; will be accounted, by &s;ome, but a <HI>Childi&s;h</HI> Remark: But others will look upon that King's Chaplain as a Conju|rer, who, twenty Years before this Plague, preaching at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>, again&s;t black Patches, or Beauty-&s;pots, &s;aid they were Fore-runners of other <HI>Spots</HI>, and Marks of the <HI>Plague</HI>; which &s;oon after broke out there, and drove all the patched Women out of the City. In his Section of <HI>Pre&s;ervation</HI>, he in&s;tances how durably the <HI>Infection</HI> will lurk among Cloths, in that fatal <HI>furred Gown</HI>, which <HI>Fraca&s;torius</HI> affirms to have killed five and twenty Men in <HI>Verona</HI>, one after another, with the <HI>Plague. La&s;tly</HI>, In his Section <HI>of the Cure of the Pe&s;tilence</HI>, he makes great U&s;e of <HI>Vinegar</HI>, in all his Ingredients, and gives us a particular <HI>Panegyrick</HI> upon its extraor|dinary Efficacy, not only in this, but many other Di&s;tempers, from Page 79, to 86; where he &s;ays, <HI>it is for the Virtue of</HI> Vinegar <HI>that I wrote this Book</HI>; and, <HI>I had rather take</HI> Vinegar <HI>by it&s;elf, than many other, nay, than any other &s;ingle Medicine without it</HI>.

<Q>This Tract may be reckoned among tho&s;e Monuments, in Memory of the Meritorious, which are too &s;carcely met with, and &s;uffered too much to run to Ruin.

Then comes a &s;hort Di&s;cour&s;e in <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>, con|taining &s;ome Reflexions by the <HI>Author</HI>, &s;ome Re&s;olutions by <HI>Fame</HI>, and &s;ome Remarks by <HI>Clio</HI>; when ro&s;e another of tho&s;e venerable Knights, and framed his Tale, in near three Pages of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> after the like Manner; by which it appears, that he was Sir <HI>Henry Pi|chard</HI>, Vintner, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>Lon|don</HI>, in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. That he led 5000 Men in his Return from the Wa$s of <HI>France</HI>; and that he then enter|tained <HI>four Kings</HI>, one <HI>Prince</HI>, and all their <HI>Train</HI> at a Banquet. Next after a &s;hort Conference, again in <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>, between <HI>Fame</HI> and <HI>Clio</HI>, aro&s;e Sir <HI>William Sevenoake</HI>, Gro|cer, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> V.

After &s;ome further Repre&s;entation of him in <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>, as to his Entertainment, and Meditations in tho&s;e Regions; he re|turns to his Re&s;t; and another li&s;ts up his aged Limbs, Sir <HI>Thomas White</HI>, Merchant-Taylor, and Lord-Mayor of <HI>London</HI>, in the Time of Queen <HI>Mary</HI>; and he unfolds his Merits in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>, for near two Pages; and though not as a Warrior, yet as a &s;ingular Benefactor to the Learned and the Poor.

After the per&s;onal Figure of this Knight is de&s;cribed, and he is &s;um|moned to di&s;play his Story, he rehear&s;es it, for near four Pages in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>, like the re&s;t; wherein he appears to have been a <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> Man, the Son of a Knight; but being bound to the Trade afore&s;aid, was &s;ent by his Ma&s;ter with Goods to <HI>Denmark</HI>; where, by &s;ome fortunate Di&s;pute, he was made favourably known to the King; &s;oon after, he &s;hewed his &s;upe|rior Valour at a Turnament, and had a Fa|vour given him by the King's Daughter. Was &s;ent General of the King's Army a|gain&s;t <HI>Soliman</HI> the Great <HI>Turk</HI>, overcame him, and was knighted by him in the Field; returned Home with rich Gifts and great Glory, and died in Honour and Peace. Next, after an Expo&s;tulation in <HI>Pro&s;e</HI>, be|tween the Godde&s;s of <HI>Renown</HI>, and her <HI>Mu&s;e</HI>, upon that &s;urpri&s;ing Grace &s;hewn by a <HI>Mahometan</HI> Tyrant, to a <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Con|queror of him, another young gay Knight ari&s;es, named Sir <HI>Chri&s;topher Croker</HI>, Vint|ner in the Reign of <HI>Edward</HI> III. and he chants out his Feats in like Manner, for the Space of two Pages, in <HI>Ver&s;e</HI>; wherein it is recorded, that he &s;erved his Time un|der his Ma&s;ter, who was named <HI>Stodie</HI>, in <HI>Gracious Street</HI>, and gained the Affections of his Daughter.

<Q>&startq;what he had granted for the Content of his People; and how he had quite, for &s;ome Time, dive&s;ted him&s;elf of the very <HI>E&s;&s;ence</HI> of <HI>Authority</HI>, and re&s;erved Nought, but the <HI>Shadow</HI>; to give Satisfaction unto his <HI>two Hou&s;es</HI>, in all their Propo&s;als put up to him; and therein, referred them to the <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners</HI> there pre&s;ent; who con|firmed &endq;the &s;ame.</Q>
But notwith&s;tanding, this his Deportment &s;o much engaged the Inhabitants to him, who are &s;aid to have been, between <HI>&s;even or eight-thou&s;and fighting Men, compleatly armed</HI>; they &s;uffered his Maje&s;ty to be tran&s;ported over to <HI>Hur&s;t Ca|&s;tle</HI>, upon the Arrival of Supplies to Colonel <HI>Ewer</HI>; where he now remained a &s;ad &s;olitary Pri&s;oner, by the Appointment of the Army only, the Parliament no Way vi&s;ibly inter|medling or approving it.</Q>

<Q>That <HI>Samuel Chidley</HI> was the Author of this &s;carce Pamphlet; and to render it the more remarkable, as well as more &s;uitable to his Subject, he has printed it all in <HI>Red Letters</HI>. In his Letter to the Lord Mayor, <HI>Thomas Andrewes</HI>, dated 25 <HI>June</HI>, 1649, he tells him,
<Q>&startq;That Chri&s;t made Interce&s;|&s;ion to God for Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, who <HI>were guilty</HI> of <HI>eternal</HI> Death before <HI>God:</HI> We make Interce&s;&s;ion for Men, who are not &endq;guilty of <HI>temporal</HI> Death before Men.</Q>

<Q>&startq;I know no Friend of mine that is guilty of Theft: What I have done is in Con&s;cience to God, and &endq;Compa&s;&s;ion to my Native Country, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
And, in his <HI>Rea&s;ons of Weighty Con&s;ideration</HI>, he &s;hews out of the Scripture, how incon|&s;i&s;tent with the Laws of God, tho&s;e of our Land are, that kill a Thief for Stealing <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Rayment</HI>, or to the Value of <HI>Four|teen Pence</HI>.

but that a Malefactor, then upon Trial for &s;tealing, refu&s;ing to Plead, till that <HI>Letter</HI> was read publickly, was denied tho&s;e Condi|tions, and &s;entenced to the <HI>Pre&s;s</HI> by the Recorder <HI>Steele</HI>. Hereupon follows his <HI>Pe|tition</HI> to the <HI>Council of State</HI>, That the then Condemned Pri&s;oners might be reprieved, till the Parliament had heard the Matter. And after this, we have his <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> to the <HI>General Council</HI> for the <HI>Army:</HI> In which he offers &s;everal Arguments for reforming the Laws relating to the Trial and Puni&s;hment of Thieves and Robbers: Concluding, that, upon Conviction, they &s;hould be obliged to make double Satisfaction, if not out of their <HI>Effects</HI>, by their <HI>Labour</HI>. We have al&s;o, following this, His <HI>Letters</HI> to the <HI>Regulators of the Law</HI> appointed by the Parliament; wherein he tells them, that the be&s;t of their Actions, in that Character, had hitherto been, at mo&s;t, but a <HI>Tything of Mint, Annis, and Cummin: And you have neglected Mercy, one of the weighty Matters of the Law:</HI> And was verily per&s;uaded, They could not have put a Stop to the Murdering of tho&s;e Men who were hanged at <HI>Tyburn</HI> the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ions, for &s;tealing Five Shillings and Six|pence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the End, there is an odd <HI>Adverti&s;ement</HI>, informing us, That Mr. <HI>Chidley</HI> appointed one of the&s;e <HI>Pamphlets</HI> to be nailed upon <HI>Tyburn Gallows</HI>, before the Execution, with this Motto over it:

But it could not be nailed on the Gallows, for the Crowd of People; therefore it was nailed to the Tree which grew upon the Bank by the Gallows; and there it remain|ed, and was read by many, both before and after Execution; and 'twas thought it would &s;tand there till it dropped away.</Q>

<Q>It is not improbable but this Pamphlet was written by Dr. <HI>Heylin</HI>'s Antagoni&s;t, <HI>Henry Hickman</HI>, whether in Conjunction with any other Per&s;on, is not certain. He taxes him with ca&s;ting &s;ome foul Blots upon the fir&s;t Patrons of, and their Motives to the <HI>Reformation</HI>. And Page 48 tells him,
<Q>&startq;We &s;hould rather judge you to be the Pupil of Dr. <HI>Harding</HI> (whom you would be thought to oppo&s;e) than of Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel</HI>, whom you do &s;eem to Reverence. Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel</HI> does not think, that he fouls either his Tongue or his Pen, in naming the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> But how oft, in your Hi&s;tory, do you, by way of Scorn, tell us of the <HI>Zuinglian</HI> Go&s;pellers, as if this were &s;ome Reproach to them, and you had nothing to do with the <HI>Go&s;pel?</HI> which, in an hundred Places, your Dr. &endq;<HI>Harding</HI> upbraids Bi&s;hop <HI>Jewel</HI> with.</Q>

And indeed, could he have <HI>an&s;wered</HI> all the&s;e <HI>Que&s;tions</HI>, as directly as they are propounded, we mu&s;t have had a very clear and &s;atisfac|tory <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>London</HI>. How|ever, the An&s;wers he does make to tho&s;e Que&s;tions may be thus briefly repre&s;ented. 1. That it was <HI>done by</HI> the Permi&s;&s;ion of God through the Carele&s;ne&s;s of Man; the <HI>Baker</HI>, or his Servants, in who&s;e Hou&s;e it began. 2.

within the Walls, was &s;eated upon about 460 Acres, which had about 15000 Hou&s;es thereon, be&s;ides Churches, Chapels, Halls, and other publick Buildings, he concludes about 12000 were burnt, which is four Parts in five, which, together with all other Build|ings, Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> he values at <HI>Seven Mil|lions Three-hundred Thirty five-thou&s;and Pounds</HI>. Then proceeds, in the &s;ame Section, to his <HI>Parallel</HI> of the Di&s;a&s;ters at <HI>Mo&s;co</HI>, as men|tioned in the Title: But in this there was a wonderful Di&s;parity, that not above <HI>half a Do|zen Londoners</HI> were lo&s;t in our Conflagration, but above <HI>Two-hundred-thou&s;and M$&s;covites</HI> mi|&s;erably con&s;umed in theirs. 3. As to the Place <HI>Where</HI>; he an&s;wers, with a &s;hort, but &s;hining Encomium upon our <HI>Metropolis</HI>; the Suffer|ings of which, might employ, he &s;ays, a better Pen, and be the Subject of a full Volume. 4. By <HI>What Means</HI>; This he an&s;wers by enlarg|ing upon his fir&s;t Paragraph, where he &s;peaks of the <HI>Negligence</HI> of the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> or his <HI>Ser|vant</HI>; the <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Deadne&s;s</HI> of the Night; <HI>Narrowne&s;s</HI> of the <HI>Streets; Clo&s;ene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Rotten|ne&s;s</HI> of the old Wooden <HI>Buildings</HI>; the <HI>Com|bu&s;tible Goods</HI> and <HI>Merchandi&s;e</HI> &s;tored all a|bout; the great Heat and Drought of the preceding Summer; the violent <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Wind, which blew all the While, the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive of all others; they approaching over the Ocean, this, over the Continent; &s;o as to burn our Flowers and Leaves of Trees, more than the hotte&s;t Sun: La&s;tly, the great Want of <HI>Water</HI>, particularly at that Time, the <HI>Thames</HI> Water-hou&s;e being out of Order; and the great Want of <HI>Room</HI> in tho&s;e Streets &s;o contracted and &s;o crouded with People, to play the Engines. 5. The Que&s;tion <HI>Why</HI>, he leaves que&s;tionable, Whether for the Pu|ni&s;hment of our <HI>Sins</HI>, the Trial of our <HI>Faith</HI>, or the Exerci&s;e of our <HI>Patience</HI>. 6. The Que|&s;tion <HI>How</HI> it was done, he refers, for an An|&s;wer, to the fourth Section. 7. And, la&s;tly, <HI>When</HI>; he an&s;wers <HI>When</HI> we were newly come out of a <HI>Civil War</HI> of twenty Years Standing; wherein about 100,000 People peri&s;hed: <HI>When</HI> the <HI>Plague</HI> had, the Year be|fore &s;wept away above 100,000 more; and was &s;till raging: <HI>When</HI> the Kingdom was ex|hau&s;ted of <HI>Money</HI>, and <HI>Trade</HI> lo&s;t: And <HI>When</HI> we had <HI>Wars</HI> with <HI>France, Denmark</HI>, and <HI>Holland</HI>, and not without Fear of Divi&s;ions among our&s;elves.

His Motives, to this Performance, appear in the fir&s;t Page to have ri&s;en from what had been &s;aid in a <HI>Pamphlet</HI> not long before publi&s;hed, entitled, <HI>A Propo&s;ition for the Safety and Peace of tho King and Kingdom</HI>, &amp;c. pag. 47. where the Writer is charged to have ca&s;t a groundle&s;s and unde&s;erved <HI>Odium</HI> upon <HI>Cathedral</HI> Men, in depre&s;&s;ing their <HI>Per&s;ons</HI>, and heightening their <HI>Emoluments</HI>; Characterizing them as; <HI>Low in their Condition, and in their Intere&s;ts; Covetous, and Unde&s;ervedly Rewarded</HI>.
<Q>&startq;And as to their <HI>Emoluments, of Twenty Years in One</HI>, if they were rea&s;onable at <HI>Canter|bury</HI> (&s;ays the Doctor) they could not be very <HI>Va&s;t</HI> in other <HI>Cathedrals</HI>. Our <HI>Fines</HI>, adds he, are divided equally, but that the <HI>Dean</HI> hath double the Share of a Prebend, and the Total of that great Income of our fir&s;t <HI>Fines</HI> (deducting the <HI>Reparation</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI>, and our <HI>Pre&s;ent</HI> to our <HI>Royal</HI> Benefactor) the Share of each of the Twelve Canons was about <HI>Eleven Hundred Pounds</HI>. Such a Sum was no exce&s;&s;ive Reward for long Suf|ferers, and con&s;tant Actors in the King's Cau&s;e, of which the mo&s;t Part of our Society con&s;i&s;teth. I am none of the

Such moderate Showers, falling upon Lands parched with a long Drought, could not drench them to an Exuberancy, to leave Pools above Ground. The Condition of my Brethren could not &endq;be much different from mine.</Q>

<Q>&startq;What had become of Ours, and all the <HI>Cathedral</HI> Churches, if all the <HI>Fines</HI> had been taken from them before the Admi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Canons?</HI> That of <HI>Canterbury</HI>, though much de|faced by <HI>Culmer</HI>, and the Fanatick Sol|diers, and decayed by a Neglect of well nigh twenty Years, was more entire than mo&s;t <HI>Cathedrals</HI> in <HI>England</HI> when we came to it; yet, in the Year 1664, we found that the <HI>Reparations</HI> of it &s;tood us in <HI>Twelve-thou&s;and Pounds</HI>; all that Ex|pence ari&s;ing out of <HI>Fines</HI>. But for the <HI>Fines</HI>, all the <HI>Cathedrals</HI> in the Kingdom, by this Time, had been Heaps of Ruins: Without the <HI>Fines</HI>, the&s;e <HI>Great Fabricks</HI>, the <HI>Greate&s;t</HI> of <HI>Europe</HI>, cannot yet be &endq;pre&s;erved from Ruin, &amp;c.</Q>

There are two or three Copies of Ver&s;es printed with this Work, in Prai&s;e of the Author, and our <HI>Woollen Manufacture</HI>; before one of which he is called Capt. <HI>Jo&s;eph Trevers</HI>.

And indeed, he does well &s;et forth the great Ad|vantages of our <HI>Woollen Trade</HI>, and the much greater it might produce, but for the many Abu&s;es of it. He &s;hews ingenuou&s;ly, how every Two Pounds of <HI>Wooll</HI>, worth about Twenty-pence, will make a Yard of <HI>Ker&s;ey</HI>, worth five or &s;ix Shillings; and every four Pounds of <HI>Wooll</HI>, worth about Three-&s;hillings and Four-pence, will make a Yard of <HI>Broad-Cloth</HI>, worth Eleven or Twelve Shillings: So that Two-thirds is the lea&s;t Profit, that ari&s;es by put|ting our Wooll into Manufactures; which amounts to above <HI>Two-hundred-thirty Pounds</HI> Sterling Profit in every <HI>Tun</HI> of <HI>Wooll</HI> &s;o wrought up, accounting Twenty-hundred <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Weight to the <HI>Tun</HI>. So that, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, but an Hundred Tuns of Wooll Tran&s;ported out of the Kingdom in a Year to <HI>France</HI>, unwrought, it will a|mount to <HI>Twenty two-thou&s;and four-hundred Pounds</HI> Sterling, which is &s;o much clear Lo&s;s to the Kingdom, and treble &s;o much Profit to <HI>France</HI>, by their working up three Times as much of their own with ours; be&s;ides the depriving thereby &s;o many of our <HI>Poor</HI> from <HI>Work</HI>, and the <HI>Rich</HI> of their <HI>Rents</HI>. But, not|with&s;tanding tho&s;e great Advantages in this Trade, it is here affirmed, that <HI>Millions</HI> of Money are lo&s;t to the King and Kingdom, by private Exportation of our <HI>Wooll</HI>, and <HI>Fuller</HI>'s <HI>Earth</HI>; the lo&s;ing our Trade, and being undermined by the <HI>Dutch</HI>; the Impor|tation of Foreign prohibited Goods, to the Detriment of the <HI>Silk-Weavers</HI>, &amp;c. and be|&s;ides the Lo&s;s by <HI>Smugglers</HI>; the Frauds of unfaithful <HI>Officers</HI>, and others concerned in the <HI>Law</HI>, are here complained of, and fur|ther offered to be laid open, to prevent the

<Q><HI>England</HI> being now engaged in a War with the <HI>Dutch</HI>, the Author thinks he could not more &s;ea&s;onably than now tran&s;mit the&s;e Papers to the &s;aid Sir <HI>Thomas</HI>. And in the 4th Page thus characteri&s;es the Writer of the foregoing Pamphlet and his Work:
<Q>&startq;This Author treats of our Dome&s;tick Af|fairs not only more Rationally, but more like a Man concerned for the Good of <HI>Eng|land</HI> than he does of our Intere&s;ts <HI>Abroad</HI>. For then, in&s;tead of examining calmly, how far the Friend&s;hip of other Countries would at this pre&s;ent be u&s;eful to us, he falls into pa&s;&s;ionate Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s for the <HI>Hollanders</HI>; as if our principal De&s;ign, in &s;eeking <HI>Foreign Alliances</HI>, ought not to be the Encrea&s;e of our Wealth and Power, but the Finding out Humours in another Nation that plea&s;e us, and the being civil to tho&s;e with whom we have been longe&s;t &endq;acquainted.</Q>
And, Page 6, he ob&s;erves upon the Author's Argument, <HI>That we ought to keep Friends with the</HI> Dutch, <HI>becau&s;e they are Traders</HI>, that it is in plain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> no more than
<Q>&startq;Becau&s;e we love Trade therefore we love Tho&s;e that take it from &endq;us.</Q>

<Q>&startq;Had the Author been a <HI>Lover</HI> in&s;tead of a <HI>Politician</HI>, he would have known that Rivals are the Things in this World which Men do and &endq;ought mo&s;t to hate.</Q>

which &s;he gave her Father in a Me&s;s of Broth; whereof, after much Torment, he died in 1666. Then they got one <HI>La Chau&s;&s;ee</HI>, who had been Servant to St. <HI>Croix</HI>, into the Family of one of her Brothers, a Coun&s;el|lor; and when both the Brothers were at Dinner, with other Company, they all ta&s;ted of a fatal Pie, which, after about two or three Months painful Sufferings, carried them both off in 1670; and five others narrowly e&s;caped the like untimely End at the &s;ame Meal. <HI>La'Chau&s;&s;ee</HI> had &s;o cunningly avoided all <HI>Su&s;|picion</HI> before the Deed, that his Ma&s;ter left him a Legacy of an Hundred Crowns.

<Q>This Pamphlet is Dedicated to the Lords and Commons in Parliament a&s;&s;embled, by the Author, <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI>; who had, for &s;ome Time, zealou&s;ly endeavoured to detect, and root out, &s;ome publick Corruptions. But it appears, that his Adverti&s;ements to the State, met with more Regard, than Reward: For he ob&s;erves, that his Tract, entitled, <HI>Eng|gland</HI>'s <HI>Glory Reviewed</HI>, which he publi&s;hed the preceding Se&s;&s;ion, had &s;everal Regulations propo&s;ed in it, which were now put in Practice, though he received not &s;o much as Thanks for them. He had, among&s;t other Things, ob&s;erved, that the greate&s;t Part of the Charge and Trouble of <HI>Collecting the Land Tax</HI> might be &s;aved, by laying the <HI>Re|ceiver-Generals</HI> wholly a&s;ide; and had applied to the Council about it; but, the Matter be|ing put off, he here revives the <HI>Propo&s;al</HI>; &s;hewing how, if he had been regarded, <HI>Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> might have been &s;aved that Year. He &s;hews, al&s;o, the great Danger there was in <HI>Selling of Imployments</HI>; whereby Enemies to the Government, getting into Offices, communicated the Secrets of it to its Enemies. He al&s;o lays open the great Re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s of the State, in not regarding the <HI>Propo&s;als</HI> of Mr. <HI>George Everett</HI>, an eminent Shipwright (publi&s;hed la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion) wherein he &s;o evidently demon&s;trated, how he could &s;ave an <HI>Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year</HI>, by the Means offered in the &s;aid Tract, for <HI>building and repairing the Royal Navy</HI>, that here are produced the Names of above forty Per&s;ons of Honour, Quality, and Experi|ence; Lords of the Admiralty, Aldermen and Merchants of <HI>London</HI>, and &s;everal Ship|wrights; who, by their Certificates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> have &s;hewed their ab&s;olute Approbation thereof: And yet no Encouragement had He. (See another Propo&s;al of his to the State; to Facilitate the <HI>Manning of our Fleets</HI>, in the 170th <HI>Article</HI> of this <HI>Catalogue</HI>.) Our Author then recounts how he had reflected (in a Book publi&s;hed the la&s;t Se&s;&s;ion) upon the mi&s;chievous Indolence of our Fleets, the two preceding Years; though they were of &s;tronger Force than the Enemy. And, to his having laid that Matter open to the View of the World, a&s;cribes the Sending of Ad|miral <HI>Ru&s;&s;el</HI> into the <HI>Streights</HI>, with &s;uch a Power, as &s;aved an Ally from Ruin: Then recites his Propo&s;al for laying a&s;ide the <HI>Pre&s;s-Ketches</HI>, and for taking up the Sailors in the &s;everal Ports, by the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Officers. He al&s;o recites the Demon&s;tration he had made of the Injuries which the Nation had received from the great <HI>Imbargoes laid upon Shipping</HI>;
<PB N="111" REF="111">
the Con&s;equence of which was, that there had been none laid this Year: In&s;omuch that the Lords of the Admiralty had ordered no Pre&s;s-Ma&s;ter &s;hould pre&s;ume to meddle with any Sailors on Board of any Outward-bound Shipping.

<Q>This Pamphlet is dedicated to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, al&s;o by <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI>. And here he more expre&s;ly detects &s;everal Male-Practices; e&s;pecially many Embezzlements of the <HI>Naval Stores</HI> in his Maje&s;ty's Yard at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>, and it is laid heavily upon Cap|tain <HI>Wil&s;haw</HI>, one of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy. And when Sir <HI>Richard Haddock</HI> was &s;ollicited to encourage the Apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome Per&s;ons who had, by &s;ini&s;ter Means, obtained &s;ome of tho&s;e Stores; he only, after near an Hour's Di&s;cour&s;e upon it, an|&s;wered, <HI>That Kings and Princes were born to be cheated</HI>. But he acknowledges the Lords of the Admiralty gave all imaginable Encou|ragement to tho&s;e who made &s;uch Di&s;cove|ries, as long as the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI>, Lord <HI>Cornwallis</HI>, and Sir <HI>Richard On&s;low</HI> were in Commi&s;&s;ion; but, upon their leaving the Board, the Scene changed, and &s;ome Per&s;ons were turned out of their Employments for their Faithfulne&s;s to his Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t and their Tru&s;ts. He next touches upon Mr. <HI>George Everett</HI>'s Propo&s;al to &s;ave One-hundred thou&s;and Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>, in building and repairing the Royal Navy, which having produced a <HI>Report</HI> from the Navy Board to the Lords of the Privy-Council, &s;igned <HI>R.

St. Loe</HI>, their Lord&s;hips are here &s;aid to have looked upon it to be a &s;candalous One; and the &s;aid Mr. <HI>Everett</HI> delivered them a <HI>Memorial</HI> in An&s;wer to it, which is here printed by our Author, who ob&s;erves how the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy preva|ricated with Mr. <HI>Everett</HI>, by a&s;&s;erting, that the Whole Charge of building and repairing of the Navy did not amount annually to One-hundred thou&s;and Pounds, when they knew, &s;ays he, that the E&s;timate given unto the Hou&s;e of Commons for the Wear and Tare of the Royal Navy, for this pre&s;ent Year, was Seven-hundred-eighty thou&s;and Pounds. Then he proceeds to &s;hew, That the <HI>Sailors</HI> being inhumanly and barbarou&s;ly treated, is the only true Cau&s;e why they de|cline the Publick Service: And, to this Pur|po&s;e, we have here a Letter written by Mr. <HI>John Trevor</HI> to the Lords of the Admiralty, laying open the Frauds u&s;ed in the Payment of Seamens <HI>Tickets</HI>; al&s;o by <HI>Queries</HI> and <HI>Runs</HI>, and other Grievances; and towards the End there is a <HI>Petition</HI>, which the Author <HI>Robert Crosfeild</HI> had delivered to the Hou&s;e of Lords, complaining of the Commi&s;&s;ioners for Sick and Wounded Seamen, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their great Mi&s;carriages here mentioned; al&s;o again&s;t the Lords of the Admiralty and Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Navy for conniving at Frauds, &s;upporting of Criminals, per&s;ecu|ting their Di&s;coverers, and turning ju&s;t Men out of Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the Examination thereupon of the &s;aid Author and one Mr. <HI>Ba&s;ton</HI>, who had publi&s;hed a Detection of tho&s;e Mi&s;carriages, and did hereafter publi&s;h more thereof, as will in this Catalogue appear.</Q>

<Q>This Author here attempts to be a <HI>Re|former</HI> of the <HI>City</HI> of <HI>London</HI>, which is the grand Pattern of other Corporations, and chiefly in their pernicious Practice of <HI>Selling Offices</HI>, or <HI>Employments</HI>; to the great En|couragement of Inju&s;tice, Extortion, and Oppre&s;&s;ion: Daily Complaints ari&s;ing, through the exce&s;&s;ive &s;training and advancing the exorbitant Fees of <HI>Coun&s;ellors, Attornies, Clerks</HI>, Serjeants, Gaolers, and other Of|ficers in this City. He argues, that a Man who be&s;tows his Time and Toil on a Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, ought in Rea&s;on to make double as much <HI>per Annum</HI> of his Money, as in a lazy Annuity; &s;o that a <HI>Serjeant</HI> for his Five-hundred Pounds &s;eems to have a ju&s;t Preten|&s;ion to get about One-hundred-fifty Pounds a Year; a round Income for a Man in his Po&s;t and Character. And how mu&s;t he rai&s;e it at <HI>Half a Crown</HI> for every Arre&s;t, of which his <HI>Yeoman</HI>, who gives about Two hundred Pounds for his Place, partakes One-third? So that, not arre&s;ting &s;ix Men every Day, one with another, to rai&s;e the Profits of his <HI>Purcha&s;e</HI> Money, he extorts <HI>Civility-Money</HI>, &amp;c. in&s;tead of Half-Crowns, half Pounds, and whole Pounds, be&s;ides &s;everal other Demands, too unrea&s;onable for the Rich to &s;uffer, but what throws the Poor often into inextricable Ruin. He in|forms us a little farther, that the <HI>Keeper</HI>'s Place of <HI>Newgate</HI> was lately &s;old for Three-thou&s;and five-hundred Pounds, and a&s;ks what an annual Income mu&s;t the Fees a|mount to, to &s;atisfy that &s;aucy Purcha&s;e, and all the &s;ubordinate Blood-&s;uckers in that one Gaol? So he tells us al&s;o, that One-thou&s;and five-hundred Pounds is paid for a <HI>City-Council</HI> or <HI>Attorney</HI>'s Place; as well as divers other Offices; which mu&s;t rai&s;e near Five-hundred Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI>, from their mi&s;erable Clients, to ballance the exce&s;&s;ive Price they pay for them. Here are many other Intimations of the mo&s;t dete&s;table Barbarity u&s;ed by &s;uch as have bought them&s;elves a Power over the Poor; in&s;o|much that the Common <HI>Hangman</HI>, encou|raged by the&s;e Examples, will &s;carcely give a <HI>Malefactor</HI> a Ca&s;t of his <HI>Office</HI>, without a <HI>Bribe</HI>; very formally demanding his Fees, and <HI>Higgling</HI> too, as nicely with him, as if he was going to do him &s;ome mighty Fa|vour.

He cen&s;ures our Suffering the E&s;cape of the <HI>Thoulon</HI> Fleet in <HI>Bre&s;t</HI>, very ju&s;tly, lays open the mi&s;erable Ca&s;e of the Sailors who are poi&s;oned and &s;tarved with bad Provi&s;ions or Want of good, in a very lively Manner, and &s;hews why &s;o little Redre&s;s was had from the Parliament. What Profits the Victualling Office made in buying of Cattle at <HI>Smithfield</HI>; and how prepo&s;terous their Contracts with the Dealers to the Of|fice were; particularly he informs us, that <HI>Thomas Middleton</HI>, the Hogman, got of them four or five-thou&s;and Pounds by his Contract one Year of them; and the next Year was a Lo&s;er by them; and, when he complained of his Lo&s;s, the Commi&s;&s;ioners procured him two thou&s;and five-hundred Pounds out of the King's Pocket; &s;o that, being burdened with Riches, he took Occa|&s;ion to hang him&s;elf. (<HI>Quere</HI>, Whether this is not the &s;ame Hogman that a late no|ble Duke is &s;aid to have trundled about with him in his Chariot, till he had won all his Money of him; and whether this was not the Occa&s;ion that he hanged him&s;elf?) But our Author is perhaps as &s;harp upon the <HI>Admiralty</HI>, as any other Topick he touches upon, where he calls it,
<Q>&startq;An Office, ma|naged we know not how, nor to what Purpo&s;e; for I dare engage to pick out as many Old Women in <HI>Wapping</HI>, that &s;hould have managed that Affair more for the Honour, Glory, and Advantage of the &endq;<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</Q>
And a little further, &s;peaking of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s and <HI>Hiram</HI>'s Navy, ob&s;erves,
<Q>&startq;That the Scripture tells us, They were under the Conduct of <HI>Ship-Men that had Knowledge of the Sea</HI>; and, in another Place, that Part of this Lading was Apes and Peacocks; but tells us no where, that <HI>Apes</HI> or <HI>Peacocks</HI> had the So|vereign Command in Sea Affairs; or that Land-men were proper Per&s;ons to com|&endq;mand Men of War.</Q>

The Belief of it at Home would make the People more impatient, if the Treaty were broke off. So proceeds to ex|amine the Grounds of Complaint in the People under this Divi&s;ion of them&mdash;The landed Men; the Clergy; Merchants; Ma|nufacturers; Shopkeepers, and Farmers. He concludes, with the Advantages which have been produced by the War and Taxes; and thinks,
<Q>&startq;The benign Providence, which hath &s;hewn us the Means of carrying on the War nine Years, with &s;o little Grief and Oppre&s;&s;ion to the People, will not de|&s;ert us, if it be found nece&s;&s;ary to continue it another Year. That our good <HI>Queen</HI> has <HI>no Views</HI>, but the Welfare of her Peo|ple; nor any Ends to pur&s;ue, by continu|ing the War unnece&s;&s;arily: And, as God forbid the War &s;hould be continued a Month, if a &s;afe and good Peace can be had now; &s;o, on the other Hand, let not not the mi&s;taken Notion, of Taxes be|ing grievous, cau&s;e it to be concluded un|&endq;timely.</Q></Q>

He was al&s;o Author of other Works, in <HI>Latin</HI>; two of them upon <HI>Naval Affairs:</HI> And li|ved to the latter End of the Year 1651. As for this Treati&s;e, it is dedicated to King <HI>James</HI>; and the Drift of it is to &s;hew how poor and &s;adly &s;upplied the Churches were in <HI>Ireland</HI>. He imputes the &s;ole Cau&s;e of their Mi&s;ery to the Multitude of Benefices long &s;ince taken from the daily Mini&s;ters of the Churches, and converted to other U&s;es, but principally to the Luxury of the Monks. For there was an Age when the <HI>Chri&s;tian Religion</HI> &s;eemed to con&s;i&s;t only in building of <HI>Mona&s;teries</HI>, and be&s;towing large Revenues upon them, which, as they were at fir&s;t bur|den&s;ome to the Temporal State, &s;o they grew baneful to the Churches, by rea&s;on of the Mul|titude of Livings they procured to be appro|priated to their U&s;es. In&s;omuch that, as our Author ob&s;erved, out of an old <HI>Leiger-Book</HI> of the Abbey of St. <HI>Thomas</HI>, in <HI>Bermingham</HI>'s Tower in <HI>Dublin</HI>&punc; a Hou&s;e of no very old Foundation, within few Years after it was erected, it had procured <HI>Fifty-nine Church-Livings</HI>, in Part, or in Whole, to be ap|propriated to its U&s;e. And the&s;e <HI>Mona&s;te|ries</HI> corrupted, by their Example, many <HI>Chantries, Colledges, Ho&s;pitals</HI>, and <HI>Nunne|ries</HI>, to do the like. Whence Barbari&s;m, Ignorance, and Super&s;tition, &s;o much pre|vailed, and few Churches were to be found, &s;erved by other than poor Vicars and &s;tipen|dary <HI>Curates</HI>, and tho&s;e chiefly Men of &s;uch coar&s;e Qualifications as one can hardly &s;ay, Whether They are le&s;s worthy of better Maintenance, or &s;uch Maintenance of better Men.</Q>

Worm or Serpent. The Whole was near Thirteen Inches long: It had an Head like a Snake; its Body &s;trait; about an Inch round, and &s;ix Inches long; of a white Co|lour, and very &s;mooth: Then it divided into two Branches, of a Fle&s;h Colour; the one, about two Inches and an Half long, the other, &s;omewhat &s;horter: Which two Branches again divided, and terminated in five long, thin Fibers a-piece. It was thought to have been growing three Years; for &s;o long the young Man had complained of a Pain in his Brea&s;t: And the Author had often noted an extraordinary Sharpne&s;s in his Eye, like the Eye of a Serpent, whence he argues from Friar <HI>Bacon</HI>, in his Book <HI>De Coelo et Mundo</HI>; and <HI>Alkindus</HI>, in his Treati&s;e <HI>De Radiis</HI>, That all Things have their peculiar Emanations, and irradiate their &s;pecific <HI>Beams</HI> from their own Centre: And that inward Di&s;ea&s;es may be di&s;covered by &s;uch Signatures &s;ent forth from their Cen|tres, analogical to their Circumferences, by which we may find the Cau&s;es, if we be diligent and careful. <HI>John Stow</HI>, in his <HI>Chron.

<Q>In this Pamphlet there is a lively Di&s;play of the Pope's Intreagues to increa&s;e the Va|riance between the King, Lords, and Com|mons of <HI>England</HI>. And here are the Nego|tiations di&s;played of &s;ome of our <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Cour|tiers to that Purpo&s;e.

The Duke of <HI>Loraine</HI> was &s;ollicited, by Sir <HI>Kenelm Digbie</HI>'s Means, who was then the Queen's Agent for the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Affairs at <HI>Rome</HI>, to help the King of <HI>England</HI> with an Army, again&s;t the <HI>Covenanteers</HI> in <HI>England</HI>.

<Q>&startq;Thus fell that illu&s;trious Prince, who&s;e Greatne&s;s in E&s;tate and Title was his only Crime; for, being of an ancient and &s;plendid Family; the Blood-Royal of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>France</HI> not being out of his Veins; and being allied to all the con&s;ide|rable Families of <HI>England</HI>; and having an E&s;tate to &s;upport that Greatne&s;s, of <HI>an hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year</HI>; be&s;ides the Fortunes he obtained by his Marriages, which were al&s;o very large; all his Pater|nal E&s;tate was di&s;po&s;ed of by the Queen, without Regard to the Innocence of his Children, the hard Mea&s;ure of his Accu&s;a|tions, and his Obedience, which led him to the Pur&s;uit of her Commands upon all Occurrences: Which E&s;tate, as it is divi|ded and improved, is valued at <HI>Five-hun|dred Thou&s;and Pounds a Year</HI>. My Lord of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI>, who was the leading Man at that Time, and &s;at with watchful Diligence, at the Helm, which he managed, as his In|tere&s;t or Pa&s;&s;ion in&s;pired him, fir&s;t propo|&s;ed the Marriage of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI> to the Duke of <HI>Norfolk</HI>; which he refu&s;ed, till

importuned by the Per&s;ua&s;ions of tho&s;e that appeared to be his Friends; and a&s;&s;ured by a Letter under Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s own Hand of her Con&s;ent; all which en&s;nared him, till the Con&s;ummation of the Mar|riage; which was made evident by a Letter kept long in the Family, from the Hands of the Queen of <HI>Scots</HI>; in which &s;he &s;ub|&s;cribed her&s;elf, <HI>Your mo&s;t obedient Wife</HI> Mary <HI>of</HI> Scotland <HI>and</HI> Norfolk. And this great Family, thus eclip&s;ed, remained under the Cloud of a &s;evere Deprivation, till the la&s;t King <HI>Charles</HI>, of Ble&s;&s;ed Memory, re&s;to|red them to their former Titles and Dig|nities: That excellent Prince con&s;idered their long and &s;ilent Sufferings, with what Forwardne&s;s mo&s;t of them engaged their Lives and Fortunes in the Service of his Royal Father; there being but two of all that great and numerous Family, that drew a Sword again&s;t their King: May tho&s;e two be buried in the dull A&s;hes of Oblivion for ever, and wiped out of our Way, as &endq;perhaps they are out of the Book of Life.</Q></Q>

<Q>This Pamphlet was drawn up by no in|con&s;iderable Hand. There are many free and whol&s;ome Ob&s;ervations in it, upon the late Mi&s;government of <HI>Scotland</HI>, and Cha|racters of tho&s;e Mini&s;ters who were employ|ed in it; which would give &s;ome clear Light into that Part of Hi&s;tory, were their Names drawn out, as they might be, of the Twilight of their initial Letters, into the open Sun|&s;hine of Words at Length; as the Duke of <HI>Lauderdale</HI>'s is, who&s;e general Character, here makes a glaring Figure, for the Mi&s;|chiefs he did, while he was Secretary in that Kingdom. In Page 41, The Author has this Political Reflection:&mdash;
<Q>&startq;Having now di&s;patched all that is either Hi&s;torical, or Argumentative, about the &s;everal Heads in Difference between the Parliament of <HI>Scot|land</HI>, and a few unadvi&s;ed, or ill-de&s;igning Men about his Maje&s;ty: I &s;hall &s;hut up this Di&s;cour&s;e with &s;ome Political Reflec|tions upon the Whole. Whereof the fir&s;t is, That it is not the having barely a <HI>Good King</HI>, that renders a People happy; but much of it mu&s;t ari&s;e from his having <HI>Good Mini&s;ters</HI> about him. For no Nation had ever a better Prince than we at pre&s;ent have; and yet we find there is Cau&s;e of Complaint, by Rea&s;on of the ill Coun&s;el|lors that po&s;&s;e&s;s his Ear. We do not think, that he entertains them out of Choice; yet that will not give his People
<PB N="152" REF="152">
Ea&s;e, though it may for a While &s;uppre&s;s their Murmurings. His Maje&s;ty being &s;o little acquainted with Men at his fir&s;t Co|ming over, might lay him open to be mi&s;|led in the Choice of his Officers; but to continue to u&s;e them, after he hath had &s;ufficient Means, as well as Opportunity of knowing their Characters, will leave an Imputation not only upon his Goodne&s;s, but upon his Wi&s;dom. For as the People have no other Way of judging of the Good|ne&s;s of their Prince, but by finding his Officers and chief Mini&s;ters to be &s;uch: So if the&s;e be not, they may po&s;&s;ibly acknow|ledge <HI>William</HI> to be a good Man, but they never will believe the <HI>King</HI> is &s;o. And <HI>Machiavel</HI>'s Ob&s;ervation, That <HI>a wi&s;e King will always find wi&s;e Mini&s;ters</HI>, is no more than what every Man is per&s;uaded of upon the fir&s;t Principles of Rea&s;on and of Com|mon Sen&s;e. I do acknowledge, that ill Men have Ways of Thru&s;ting them&s;elves upon Princes, which they that are vertuous think too unworthy, and below them to u&s;e. For whereas the latter are always mode&s;t, and &s;eek no Recommendations but from their own Merit; the former are importunate, and can both flatter and bribe Favourites to &s;peak well of them. It was a &s;evere Prediction, as well as Ob&s;ervation; which the late Prince of <HI>Conde</HI> made upon the News of King <HI>Charles the Second</HI>'s Death, and of his <HI>Brother</HI>'s Succeeding him, <HI>That he was like to be well &s;erved, through having none about him, but his own Fools, and his Predece&s;&s;ors Knaves</HI>. How may wi&s;e Men then imagine his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty is like to be &s;erved, who, though he hath not the Fools of the la&s;t Reign about him, yet He hath both the Knaves of That, and &endq;of the Former! <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></Q>

About five Months after, there appeared upon one of the Grains the Face of a Man <HI>(Garnet</HI>'s no Doubt) &s;pecked out in Miniature. And not only all <HI>England</HI>, but all <HI>Europe</HI>, at lea&s;t as far as <HI>Rome</HI>, was belittered with the News of this miraculous Straw. It was &s;o fruitful, that it multiplied many Hundred Fold, and not without the Improvement of many of|ficious Engraftments; as may be &s;een above. Copper-Plates were engraved of it; Volumes, Pamphlets, and Poems have been written of it, in <HI>Latin</HI>, and in <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>. Four Years af|ter, a Je&s;uit, who calls him&s;elf <HI>Jack Andrew</HI>, publi&s;hed an <HI>Apology</HI> for this Brother of his, under this Title, <HI>Andreae Eudaemon Joannis Cydonii &egrave; Societate Je&s;u, ad Actionem Prodito|riam Edouardi Coqui Apologia</HI> pro R.

And though they &s;uffered Shipwreck, upon the Rocks that &s;urround tho&s;e I&s;lands, yet were they pre&s;erved every Man, which ne|ver before befel any but them&s;elves. There, without any human Creature to mole&s;t them, they lived in Health and Safety near a Twelve-month, till, having built two little Ships of the Cedar that grew there, in them they went to <HI>Virginia</HI>, leaving only two Men behind; whom Sir <HI>George Sommers</HI>, return|ing again the &s;ame Year, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, &s;ent thither in 1612, found in good Plight.

<Q>The learned and ingenious Author of this Di&s;cour&s;e, afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Exeter</HI>, &amp;c. dedicates it to the Right Honourable, <HI>Ed|ward</HI> Lord <HI>Denny</HI>, Baron of <HI>Waltham</HI>. To whom he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;If any Men had Rea&s;on to be in Love with the Face of a foreign Entertainment, tho&s;e are they who were admitted to the Attendance of the truly Generous and Honourable Lord <HI>Hay</HI> your mo&s;t noble Son, in his late Emba&s;&s;age to <HI>France</HI>, in which Number, my Unwor|thine&s;s was allowed to make one, who can therefore well witne&s;s, that no Man could either receive more Honour from a &s;trange &endq;Country, or do more Honour to his own.</Q>
But, a little further, he &s;ays,
<Q>&startq;Whil&s;t o|thers were enjoying the noble Courte&s;ies of the Time, my Thoughts entertained them&s;elves with Searching into the Proof of that ordinary Travell, wherewith I &s;aw Men commonly affected; which, I mu&s;t needs confe&s;s, the more I &s;aw, the le&s;s &endq;I liked.</Q>
A little further, That he looked not at earthly Commodities in Travel, but at the Soul;
<Q>&startq;which, I well &s;aw, u&s;es not only to gather no Mo&s;s in this Rolling, but &s;uffers the be&s;t Graces it hath to mol|der away in&s;en&s;ibly, in &s;uch unnece&s;&s;ary Agitation. I have now been twice Abroad; both Times, as thinking my&s;elf worthy of Nothing but Neglect, I bent my Eyes upon others, to &s;ee what they did, what they got. My Inquiry found our Spiritual Lo&s;s &s;o palpable, that, now at la&s;t, my Heart could not chu&s;e but break forth at my Hand, and tell my Countrymen of &endq;the dangerous I&s;&s;ue of their Curio&s;ity.</Q>

From the Trea|ti&s;e it&s;elf, many &s;trong Arguments might be extracted, to demon&s;trate the greater Like|lihood of Corrupting our Morals, than Im|proving our Behaviour, by the ordinary Cour&s;e of Travel; but no where more than in the twenty-fir&s;t <HI>Section</HI>, from Page 81, to 85; where he a&s;ks, <HI>What Mi&s;chief have we among us, that we have not borrowed?</HI> So runs through a long Train of them; begin|ning at our Skin, and the Variety of our vain Di&s;gui&s;es; as if we had not Wit enough to be fooli&s;h, unle&s;s we were taught it.

Where did we learn,
<Q>&startq;&s;ays he, the Art of Di&s;hone&s;ty in practical <HI>Machiaveliani&s;m</HI> in fal&s;e Equivocations? Where the &s;light Account of that Filthi|ne&s;s, which is but condemned as venial, and tollerated, as not unnece&s;&s;ary? Where the Skill of civil and honourable Hypo|cri&s;y, in tho&s;e formal Complements which do neither expect-Belief from others, nor carry any from them&s;elves? Where that unnatural Villany, which though it were burnt with Fire and Brim&s;tone from Hea|ven, and the A&s;hes of it drowned in the <HI>Dead Sea</HI>, yet hath made Shift to revive, and calls for new Vengeance upon the Actors, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Lo! here, dear Country|men, the Fruit of your idle Gaddings.

<Q>This Pamphlet has many good Argu|ments and Remarks in it, in An&s;wer to the Objections u&s;ually made to &s;uch Under|takings; however, the Author mode&s;tly thinks in his Preface, that they are not filed and &s;moothned enough for the Pre&s;s.

The Conclu&s;ion of the whole Treati&s;e: In which it appears, the Conditions in this Undertaking were, that, be&s;ides the Immunities and Privileges grant|ed by his Maje&s;ty, the Planters were each to have an Hundred or two Acres of Land, upon Di&s;bur&s;ing five and twenty Pounds a|piece; and &s;o for more proportionably for the Rai&s;ing of the Common Stock.</Q>

<Q><P>This Catalogue was probably compiled by the Printer or Vender of it.

But as all <HI>Catalogues of Books</HI> are of great U&s;e in Literary Pur&s;uits, &s;o might this have informed &s;ome Writers, who have attempted to revive &s;everal of the Authors pre&s;erved therein, of many Articles, which would have rendered their Account of them more complete.

W.</HI> At the End, he gives us to under&s;tand that he propo&s;es to publi&s;h a <HI>Lexicon</HI>, to compleat his Scheme, and he &s;ets forth his intended Method therein, and by an <HI>Index</HI> to refer each <HI>Word</HI>, by Num|bers, to the &s;ame <HI>Word</HI>, with its <HI>Character</HI>, in the <HI>Lexicon:</HI> With another <HI>Index</HI>, to contain all the <HI>Radical Characters</HI>, with their Significations annexed. For, by finding the <HI>Radix</HI> in your <HI>Index</HI>, you are directed to the <HI>Lexicon</HI>, and, under that <HI>Radix</HI>, you find the Word de&s;ired. This Project has been thought &s;o practicable, &s;o con&s;iderable, and of &s;uch exten&s;ive Benefit to Mankind, by many learned Men, that they have, with great Study and Labour, endeavoured to improve upon, and render it &s;till more commodious and prevailing: <HI>Cave Beck</HI>, Ma&s;ter of Arts, publi&s;hed his <HI>Univer&s;al-Cha|racter</HI> in 8<HI>vo</HI>, 1657. <HI>George Dolgarne</HI>, a <HI>Scot&s;man</HI>, publi&s;hed his <HI>Ars Signorum, vulgo Character Univer&s;alis, &amp; Lingua Philo&s;ophica, London</HI>, 8<HI>vo.</HI> 1660, which has been enlar|ged and improved upon, by Bi&s;hop <HI>Wil|kins</HI>, in his <HI>E&s;&s;ay towards a Real Character, and a Philo&s;ophical Language. Folio</HI>, 1008. An Account of which may be &s;een in the <HI>Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions</HI>, Num. 35. <HI>Quere</HI>, whether &s;ome, or all of the&s;e Authors, have have not con&s;ulted, and been beholden to the Pamphlet above?</Q>
<P N="548">548. A <HI>Declaration</HI> concerning the newly invented <HI>Art</HI> of <HI>Double Writing</HI>. Wherein are expre&s;&s;ed the Rea&s;ons of the Author's Proceed|ings in Procuring a <HI>Priviledge</HI> for the &s;ame: As al&s;o of the <HI>Time, Manner</HI>, and <HI>Price</HI> of the <HI>Di&s;covery</HI> of the &s;aid <HI>Art</HI>; and of the <HI>In|&s;truments</HI> belonging thereunto. For the Sati&s;|faction of all that de&s;ire to be Partakers of the <HI>great Benefit</HI> of the &s;ame, before they adventure any Thing towards the <HI>Reward</HI> thereof. Whereunto is annexed a Copie of an <HI>Ordi|nance</HI> of both <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> of <HI>Parliament</HI>, approving the Fea&s;ibility and great U&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>Inven|tion</HI>; and allowing a <HI>Priviledge</HI> to the <HI>Inventor</HI> for the <HI>&s;ole Benefit</HI> thereof, for <HI>fourteen Years</HI>, upon the Penalty of one-hundred Pounds. Printed by <HI>R. L.</HI> for <HI>R. W.</HI> at the <HI>Star</HI> under St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Church in <HI>Cornwall. Quarto</HI>, 1648</P>
<Q>We cannot make &s;uch Ob&s;ervations upon this remarkable <HI>Invention</HI>, as we would, all the Copy of our Pamphlet, except this Ti|tle, and a little Part of the Preface, being, at pre&s;ent, mi&s;laid. I think, I have read it to be the Product of Sir <HI>William Petty</HI>'s fruitful Brain, however it may have e&s;caped <HI>Anthony Wood</HI>, in his Catalogue of that noted Per&s;on's Works. This Invention was af|terwards a&s;&s;umed, or revived, with &s;ome Improvements, by Mr. <HI>George Ridpath</HI>, a <HI>Scots</HI> Writer of News, and other Things, in King <HI>William</HI>'s Time. It certainly &s;eems of great U&s;e, that <HI>one Man</HI> can &s;et <HI>two Pens</HI> at Work, or make <HI>two Copies</HI> of a <HI>Writing</HI> at one <HI>Time</HI>; by which, <HI>Tran|&s;cripts</HI> may be made as &s;oon again, as other|wi&s;e; and many <HI>Errors</HI> prevented. But, whether &s;uch <HI>Engines</HI> would be greater Friends or Enemies, if brought into pub|lick U&s;e, by Depriving Half the Hands in publick Offices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> of Employment, &s;hould be fir&s;t con&s;idered.</Q>
