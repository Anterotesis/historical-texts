<L>THE tragic Mu&s;e has long forgot to plea&s;e</L>
<L>With <HI>Shake&s;pear</HI>'s Nature, or with <HI>Fletcher</HI>'s Ea&s;e:</L>
<L>No Pa&s;&s;ion mov'd, thro' five long Acts you &s;it,</L>
<L>Charm'd with the Poet's Language, or his Wit.</L>
<L>Fine Things are &s;aid, no matter whence they fall;</L>
<L>Each &s;ingle Character might &s;peak them all.</L>
<L>But from this modern fa&s;hionable Way,</L>
<L>To Night, our Author begs your Leave to &s;tray.</L>
<L>No fu&s;tian Hero rages here to Night;</L>
<L>No Armies fall, to fix a Tyrant's Right:</L>
<L>From lower Life we draw our Scene's Di&s;tre&s;s:</L>
<L>&mdash; Let not your Equals move your Pity le&s;s!</L>
<L>Virtue di&s;tre&s;t in humble State &s;upport;</L>
<L>Nor think, &s;he never lives without the Court.</L>
<L>Tho' to our Scenes no Royal Robes belong,</L>
<L>And tho' our little Stage as yet be young <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This Tragedy was fir&s;t acted at the Little Theatre in the <HI>Hay-Market</HI>.</NOTE>,</L>
<L>Throw both your Scorn and Prejudice a&s;ide,</L>
<L>Let us with Favour, not Contempt be try'd;</L>
<L>Thro' the fir&s;t Acts a kind Attention lend,</L>
<L>The growing Scene &s;hall force you to attend;</L>
<L>Shall catch the Eyes of every tender Fair,</L>
<L>And make them charm their Lovers with a Tear.</L>
<L>The Lover too by Pity &s;hall impart</L>
<L>His tender Pa&s;&s;ion to his fair One's Heart:</L>
<L>The Brea&s;t which others Angui&s;h cannot move,</L>
<L>Was ne'er the Seat of Friend&s;hip, or of Love.</L>
