<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_IT was ea&s;y to &s;ee at the
Clo&s;e of the fir&s;t Volume of
this Work, that the Subject
was not exhau&s;ted, whatever
the Trade&s;man was; and how
compleat &s;oever he was to be made by
the intended In&s;tructions of the Author,
and upon the Foot of the long Expe|rience
of the Advi&s;er, yet the Advices
were not compleat, and much remain'd to
be &s;poken, every Way as u&s;eful and ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary as what was &s;aid be|fore.</P>
<P>THIS Volume has gone thorough with
the Work, and I doubt not will be found
both as profitable and as entertaining as the
other: As it is di&s;tingui&s;h'd from the fir&s;t
by the Nature of its Advices, &s;o 'tis di|rected
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
in a differing Manner: The fir&s;t
Volume particularly called for the Atten|tion
of young Trade&s;men in their Begin|ning,
Introduction, and fir&s;t Steps in Trade,
in order to make their Way &s;afe, their
Going on ea&s;y, and their End pro&s;perous.</P>
<P>THIS Part is directed as well to the
old, as to the young Trade&s;men; it is to
the Men of Bu&s;ine&s;s; as well to the over|grown,
as to the growing; the upper Cla&s;s,
as well as the lower; and it may be ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to both.</P>
<P>WHILE the Trade&s;man is not above Tra|ding,
he will find him&s;elf not out of the
Need of Caution: Age in Trade has its
trading Di&s;ea&s;es as well as Age in Body,
and may in proportion &s;tand in Need of the
Phy&s;ician; and as ill Habits increa&s;e, and
grow fatal to Men in Years, and are hard|e&s;t
to cure, &s;o ill Habits in the Youth of
Trade, grow upon the Trade&s;man as his
Pur&s;e thickens, and his Strength in Trade
increa&s;es, and ought to be well guarded
again&s;t.</P>
<P>A young Trade&s;man has Dangers to
&s;hun, and wi&s;e Mea&s;ures to learn, the Good
or Evil of which are to him&s;elf; the old
well-thriven Trade&s;man, when his Mea&s;ures
are taken, and when he is over Head and
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
Ears, as we call it, in getting Money, grows
dangerous to him&s;elf, and to the whole
Body of Trade&s;men about him.</P>
<P>'TIS needful to warn them both; the
young again&s;t the early Practice, and the
old again&s;t the full-grown Habit; and the
fir&s;t Part of this Work is adapted to both.</P>
<P>THE Length of the nece&s;&s;ary Advices
has oblig'd me to leave out a very u&s;eful
Chapter, which was addre&s;s'd to both Kinds
of Trade&s;men, the Old, as well as the
Young: The Subject was again&s;t that dange|rous
Thing, which the wi&s;e Man calls <HI>&s;triking
Hands with a Stranger;</HI> by which I mean,
and &s;o did <HI>Solomon</HI> al&s;o, the Trade&s;mens
being bound one for another.</P>
<P>IT is true, that as the particular Circum|&s;tances
of Trade are now &s;tated, it is hardly
po&s;&s;ible for Trade&s;men to go through the
World in their Bu&s;ine&s;s without being
bound for one another; the high Duties,
&s;uch as Exci&s;es, Cu&s;toms, and the Number
of Offices in the publick Revenue, obli|ging
Men to get Bond&s;men; the Govern|ment
gives Credit, but requires Security,
and it &s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary they
&s;hould do &s;o; and this in &s;ome Things
makes my Advices be given with the more
Caution; but let it be upon what Occa&s;ion
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
it will, the Trade&s;man ought to be very
wary of engaging him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THREE Things every Trade&s;man ought
to con&s;ider before he &s;trikes Hands with a
Stranger, that is, before he is bound for
another.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHETHER he is able to pay the Debt;
for he that is bound for a Debt, mu&s;t
expect to pay the Debt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT when he binds him&s;elf for his
Friend, he binds his Wife, Children,
and E&s;tate, and brings them all into
the Hazard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT he binds al&s;o, all tho&s;e innocent
Trade&s;men who deal with him, and
perhaps tru&s;t him; who put their E&s;tates
and Families, as it were, into his Hand,
and who in Ju&s;tice ought not to be em|bark'd
in the Ri&s;que, or brought to run
more Hazards than they are aware of.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>WOULD the con&s;idering Trade&s;man give
the&s;e three Heads their due Weight in his
Thoughts when he is called upon to do the
(fatal) kind Office of being Surety for his
Friend, he would not be ea&s;ily drawn into
any Snare on that Account.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7">
THERE are &s;ome Di&s;tinctions indeed which
&s;hould be made in this Ca&s;e, and Sureti|&s;hip
&s;hould be divided into three Heads al&s;o:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. BEING Bail for Appearance: This indeed
depends not upon the Trade&s;man's Abi|lity,
but his Hone&s;ty; for if the Bond
be for a Debt, the Man may not be
able to pay it; and &s;o the Trade&s;man,
who is bound may be oblig'd to pay
the Debt, tho' the Man were hone&s;t; but
if it be only Bail for Appearance, that
he is always able to do if he be alive,
and if he dies, the Obligation cea&s;es;
&s;o that there is not the &s;ame Hazard
by a great deal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. BEING bound for the Hone&s;ty of a
Per&s;on upon entering into publick Of|fices
or Tru&s;ts This al&s;o depends up|on
the Integrity of the Man, not his
Ability; and though it be more dan|gerous
than the fir&s;t, yet not equally
with the la&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. BUT the la&s;t is downright Sureti&s;hip
for the Debt; and the Trade&s;man ought
never to do it, unle&s;s, as above, his
Circum&s;tances are &s;uch, that he can
pay the Debt without Hazard to his
Credit or to his Creditors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8">
I could not but mention this here, ha|ving
been prevented from &s;peaking at large
to it, in its proper Place, for want of Room.</P>
<P>THE latter Part of this Work may &s;erve as
a Plan of the Inland Trade of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI>
the Title is an Index of the Work;
its U&s;es are general, and it concerns the
younger as well as the elder Trade&s;men;
the Tables, the Calculations, and the Con|clu&s;ions
are equally needful and u&s;eful to
them all, and I could not think the Work
compleat without them.</P>
<P>THE whole De&s;ign is now perfected;
the World will &s;ee no more Volumes upon
this Subject; our Bu&s;ine&s;s being not to
multiply Books, but to make the Advices
compleat, that they may make the Trade&s;|men
&s;o.</P>

too much may rather make him
too enterprizing, or too indolent, yet the

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_HItherto we have talk'd in a Dia|lect
&s;uited to the young Trade&s;|man,
to whom the Subject was
more immediately directed, and
given Advices, as the Circum|&s;tances
of young Beginners might be &s;up|po&s;ed
to want it.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t Entrance into Trade, the
Trade&s;man, like a young Commander of
a Ship, launching into the Ocean for a
long Voyage which he had never been be|fore,
&s;hould look out for skilful A&s;&s;i&s;tants,
as the Captain take experienced Mates,
and, if need be, a good Pilot, that knows
the Coa&s;t, to &s;tand to him, and give him
<PB N="2" REF="14">
good Direction, when he comes to make
Land; to de&s;cribe the Bearings, try the
Depths, and other Difficulties which u&s;ually
occur in &s;uch Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>OUR former Work has been recommend|ed
as a Pilot or Guide to the young Trade&s;|men
of this I&s;land; and as it was no more
than what was extremely wanted among
them, &s;o they cannot &s;ugge&s;t that it has not
been &s;ignificant; worth my undertaking,
and their Acceptance; nothing of the like
Nature having been attempted before;
it mu&s;t be acknowledged then to be u&s;eful,
unle&s;s they that &s;ugge&s;t otherwi&s;e will fir&s;t
tell us that the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>
are an incon&s;iderable Branch of our
People, a Cla&s;s who&s;e Significance is not
much, their Number &s;mall, and their Pro|&s;perity
of little Importance to the whole
Body of the Nation.</P>
<P>BUT they mu&s;t be extremely ignorant of
the State of Commerce in this Nation, and
of the Number and Weight of the Trade&s;|men
among us, who would venture to &s;ay
&s;o; for that though <HI>it is true</HI> I confine my
whole Di&s;cour&s;e to the Trade&s;men concern'd
in our Inland Trade only, which they call the
lowe&s;t Cla&s;s, and the meane&s;t of the trading
World, next but one Degree above the la|bouring
Poor, yet I mu&s;t lay this Objection
in their Way, <HI>viz.</HI> that as low as they may
or can &s;uppo&s;e them to be, they are the
<PB N="3" REF="15">
mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential to the Trade it&s;elf, the mo&s;t
con&s;iderable in Number, and employ among
them the large&s;t Share of the Capital
Stock of the whole Kingdom, having al&s;o,
without Compari&s;on, the greate&s;t Share of
Credit: Let us join I&s;&s;ue then upon that
Point, and examine the Particulars.</P>
<P>IT would be hard, indeed, to make a Gue&s;s
at the Numbers of tho&s;e I call Trade&s;men,
as they are de&s;cribed in our former Volume,
and to whom that Di&s;cour&s;e and this is to be
directed, and who are employed in the In|land
Trade of this Nation: I'll fir&s;t give you
a new De&s;cription of them in a few Words.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THEY are to be under&s;tood to contain
all tho&s;e People through who&s;e Hands
the Produce and Manufacture of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> pa&s;s for Sale from their being
fini&s;hed, and fitted for the Market to
their immediate Con&s;umption or Expor|tation;
the Whole&s;ale Trade&s;men being
the fir&s;t Buyer, and the Retale Shop-Keeper
the la&s;t Seller of all the &s;aid
Produce and Manufacture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ALL tho&s;e Trade&s;men who are likewi&s;e
employed in buying Goods of foreign
Growth, from the Merchant who is the
Importer; and &s;elling them again as well
by Whole&s;ale as Retale, from one to
another, how many Hands &s;oever they
<PB N="4" REF="16">
may pa&s;s through, whether to be manfac|tured
or worn, till, as above, they come
to the la&s;t Con&s;umer: Of all which I
&s;hall &s;peak at large in its Order.</ITEM>
</LIST>
By the la&s;t Con&s;umer here is not merely un|der&s;tood
tho&s;e that eat or wear, and &s;o con|&s;equently
con&s;ume the Goods, whether the
home Produce and Manufacture, or the fo|reign
Importation; but tho&s;e other Trade&s;|men
or Manufacturers, who, in their ordinary
Employments and Bu&s;ine&s;s, u&s;e up and em|ploy
tho&s;e Goods as Materials, or ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary Articles in the making, or manufac|turing,
or preparing other Goods. <HI>For Ex|ample;</HI></P>
<P>FIRST the Wool is carried from Place to
Place before it comes to the Manufacturer,
and is made the Subject of Trade in two or
three Capacities, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Farm to the
Wool-Stapler, or from the Butcher to the
Fell-Monger; from tho&s;e again to this or
that Market, and &s;ometimes to &s;everal; then
to the Wool-Comber, and at la&s;t is bought by
the Woollen Manufacturer, by whom it is
brought to the Con&s;umption: For there is an
End of its Species as Wool; it no longer bears
its own Name, but is lo&s;t in the &s;everal Names
of the Manufacture into which it is con|verted.</P>
<P>So the Oil imported from <HI>Sevill, Li&s;|bon,
Cadiz, Gallipoli,</HI> and &s;everal other
<PB N="5" REF="17">
Places, or made at our own Oil-Mills,
and the <HI>Train</HI> Oil brought from <HI>New Eng|land,
Newfoundland, Greenland, &amp;c.</HI> is all
lo&s;t in the Hands of the &s;aid Manufacturers;
they are properly the la&s;t Con&s;umers.</P>
<P>THE &s;everal Drugs and Dye-Stuffs, &s;uch as
Dying Woods, Braziletto, <HI>Nicaragua Wood,</HI>
Logwood, Fu&s;tick, Shumach, and the like;
the Red Earth, the Lichen, the Gums,
the Gauls, Cochineal, Indico, Woad, and
abundance of other Things both of our
own and foreign Growth, which are the Sub|ject
of Commerce, and very con&s;iderable Ar|ticles
of Trade, are lo&s;t in the Dye-Fat,
and the Dyer is to them the la&s;t Con&s;umer:
The like of Painters Colours, which include
abundance of curious Things, the Produc|tions
both of Nature and Art.</P>
<P>THE like al&s;o of Drugs u&s;ed in Medicine,
the Furniture of the Labaratories of the Learn|ed,
the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the Phy&s;ician's

the Surgeon and Apothecary, are the

who&s;e Hands tho&s;e Things pa&s;s by way of
Sale, either from the fir&s;t Grower or Planter
of them at home, or the Importer of them
from abroad, are what I properly call <HI>Trade&s;|men.</HI>
For Example;
<Q><PB N="6" REF="18">
<P>THE Dye Stuffs are bought from the Mer|chant
Importer by the <HI>Salter,</HI> he is the
Trade&s;man; he &s;ells &s;ome of them to
the Country Shop-Keepers, and they are
Trade&s;men in that particular Article;

the la&s;t Con&s;umers.</P>
<P>THE Drugs are bought from the Merchant
Importer by the Druggi&s;t, and by him

the Surgeons, and the Phy&s;icians,
&s;uch of them (at lea&s;t) as make up any
Medicines, Salves, or other Prepara|tions
of their own; and the&s;e are the
Trade&s;men in tho&s;e particular Ca&s;es;
and &s;o of the re&s;t.</P></Q>
But ordinarily the la&s;t Con&s;umer of every
Species in Trade, is the Per&s;on who buys by
Retale for his own or his Family U&s;e, &s;uch
Things either for eating, drinking, wearing,
or u&s;ing, as are never to pa&s;s any farther in
Sale.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE the Per&s;on who, as a Mer|chant
or Adventurer, buys for Exportation,
and for Con&s;umption in foreign Parts, &s;o
that it is no more expo&s;ed to Sale, or
pa&s;&s;es through any other Hands trading in
this I&s;land or Country: The&s;e are indeed
the la&s;t Con&s;umers, <HI>as to us,</HI> and are at
the End of the Inland Commerce, as much

Now all the People thus concerned be|tween
the two Extremes, between the Growth

how many in proportion to others, but how

the Weight they bear in Trade, and the

IT is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to make a Calcula|tion

<P>THE Number of Hor&s;es and Carriages
for the carrying Goods to Fairs, and to

it is &s;o prodigious a Thing, that if the
Trade it&s;elf, and the Trade&s;men which ma|nage
it, were not incredibly great and con&s;i|derable,
beyond expre&s;&s;ing, what could it be
&s;upported by?</P>
<P>LET no Man then pretend to tell us the
Trade&s;men of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are a mean
and incon&s;iderable Cla&s;s of Men, and of
&s;mall Importance in the Affair of Commerce:
It is mo&s;t certain, that the greate&s;t Stroke
of Trade in the whole World is carried on
<PB N="13" REF="25">
under their Hands, and by their Stocks: They
are the Life of all the Inland Trade of the
Nation: The whole Manufacture and Pro|duce
goes through their Hands: They are
in all their Circum&s;tances beyond our Cal|culation:
In their Number mon&s;trous, and
beyond all Conjecture: In their Sub&s;tance,
yet infinitely more, and beyond all Account:
As al&s;o in the Credit they both give and
take for the carrying on the &s;aid Commerce.</P>
<P>As they are then &s;o con&s;iderable a Body,
and really much more then I have or can &s;et
forth in Writing, it is not of &s;mall Import
to &s;peak to them by way of Inftruction: The
ill or well Government of &s;uch a Body of
People mu&s;t be of Con&s;equence to the pub|lick
Intere&s;t; the evil or good Management of
&s;uch a Weight of Bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t have a great
deal depending upon it; the Con&s;equence of
any general Mi&s;take, and of any fal&s;e Steps
taken in an Affair which the whole Com|munity
of Trade mu&s;t be &s;o much concern'd
in, mu&s;t be very great.</P>
<P>A vulgar Error, generally e&s;pou&s;ed in &s;uch
a Ca&s;e as this, and in carrying on &s;uch a
Commerce, may at any Time be fatal to the
whole Commerce; at lea&s;t, any Thing uni|ver&s;ally
e&s;pou&s;ed among them, is either ex|ceedingly
to the Good and Advantage of the
whole Body, or to their Damage and Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>A Mi&s;carriage here is in Commerce, as a
Plague or Infection is in the State of Health,
<PB N="14" REF="26">
dangerous and de&s;tructive to the whole Body,
and may be as fatal in Proportion: For Ex|ample;
any Stagnation of Credit, any Alte|ration
of Coin, any publick Tax imprudent|ly
laid upon this or that Branch of the Trade
where it is rival'd by Foreigners: How do
&s;uch Things &s;pread their Influence through
the whole Body, and give a Wound not to
this or that Trade&s;man in particular, but to
the whole Article of Trade in general?</P>
<P>How did the Advance of the Rate of Gui|neas,
&s;o long ago as the Year 1694-95. give
a Shock to the whole Trade, and to all the
Manufacture of <HI>Britain?</HI> And had it not
been prudently check'd, and provided again&s;t
by the Parliament immediately following,
how would it have brought an immen&s;e
Wealth out of the publick Stock of the Na|tion
into the Hands of Foreigners. For Ex|ample;</P>
<P>AN
Ounce of Gold co&s;t from three Pounds
eighteen Shillings to four Pounds; at la&s;t,
came to four Pounds five Shillings in <HI>Hol|land</HI>
or <HI>France:</HI> This being &s;ent over hither,
and coined into Guineas, at thirty Shil|lings,
immediately yielded &s;ix Pounds; with
this &s;ix Pounds co&s;ting four Pounds, that
<HI>Dutch</HI> Man or Foreigner going to Market,
bought as many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufactures as the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant could buy for &s;ix Pounds,
really co&s;ting &s;ix Pounds Sterling; con&s;equent|ly
when the&s;e Goods came to Market, &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="15" REF="27">
at <HI>Cadiz</HI> or <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant
was able to &s;ell as cheap, with 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Gain, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant could &s;ell with
25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>THIS is a plain Ca&s;e; and had it gone on,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> would in a little while have got
all the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufacture into their Hands
for nothing, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant abroad
mu&s;t have been undone, and in the End the
Manufacturer al&s;o.</P>
<P>I COULD give In&s;tances of other publick
Di&s;a&s;ters, which, when they fall upon Trade,
are to it as publick Calamities are to a Na|tion:
And this is the Rea&s;on why &s;ea&s;onable
Advices to Trade&s;men are from being low|priz'd,
or to be e&s;teemed needle&s;s or imper|tinent;
when the greate&s;t Dangers are in
View, the mo&s;t early Councils are and ought
to be e&s;teemed friendly and valuable.</P>
<P>NOT that I a&s;&s;ume the Station of an In-&s;tructor
to all the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI>
but &s;omething may po&s;&s;ible be &s;aid,
which all the Trade&s;men in <HI>England</HI> may
pick u&s;eful Things from, and apply to
proper Purpo&s;es for the general Good:
The wi&s;er Trade&s;men will make good u&s;e of
tho&s;e Advices, which they have the lea&s;t
occa&s;ion for; and the re&s;t will both find oc|ca&s;ion
for them, and make u&s;e of them
with Prudence for their own Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="28">
BUT our Undertaking wants no Excu&s;es,
no Flouri&s;hes; it is directed chiefly to Peo|ple
who, being young in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and newly
venturing upon Trade, cannot have any Pre|tence
to be above Directions: Such as not
being grown Compleat Trade&s;men, are in the
Way for it, and cannot but want Direction
in their Way.</P>
<P>To &s;uch what is pa&s;t has been directed,
and they have accepted the Good-will of it,
and given Te&s;timony to the Weight of the
Advices.</P>
<P>WE are now turning the Tables, and
talking to the Trade&s;men in another Capa|city:
Before I directed them how to thrive;
I am now telling them how to behave when
they are thriven; how to improve upon their
Improvement; grow rich after they are
grown rich; and to act in the Shape and Ap|pearance
of e&s;tabli&s;hed Trade&s;men already
thriven.</P>
<P>THERE are Mea&s;ures &s;till wanting for the
Trade&s;man, even after he is grown rich: 'Tis
never too late to give him due Caution to de|&s;erve
his Character, pre&s;erve the Reputation he
has got, and keep his Money. I have given you
great Examples of the Mi&s;carriages of tho&s;e
in Trade, who once thought them&s;elves as
much above the World as any Trade&s;men
now in <HI>Great Britain</HI> can do, who thought
them&s;elves out of the Reach of Di&s;a&s;ter,
above the Shocks of Fortune, above the
<PB N="17" REF="29">
Fear, or even the Po&s;&s;ibility of a Blow:
How many &s;uch have I &s;een come down,
even till they became below Contempt.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man, as he is never out of
Danger of being overborn in his Commerce,
&s;o he is never out of the Danger of a Blow
to his Credit; and for both tho&s;e Rea&s;ons can|not
be out of the Reach of good Council.</P>
<P>You will be apt to &s;ay in Contempt of
this, that they are out of Danger of a Wound;
they are &s;tanch, and fear nothing, and there|fore
'tis good Council to them to defy Dan|gers
di&s;tant or pre&s;ent; and in Ca&s;es of real
and pre&s;ent Dangers, to be as bold as if they
were all di&s;tant.</P>
<P>ONE of the greate&s;t Dangers attending
a thriving Trade&s;man, is, le&s;t he &s;hould do
&s;ome little weak Thing to adventure his
Credit, or &s;ome gro&s;s and fooli&s;h Thing to
endanger his Stock. I have here given Exam|ples
where the greate&s;t and be&s;t-a&s;&s;ur'd have
mi&s;carried; and we &s;hall &s;ee 'tis very ea&s;y.</P>
<P>THE Account I have given in this Work of
the Magnitude of our Commerce, is an Argu|ment
to confirm this Danger: There are Ad|venures
in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade, too big for any
Man's &s;ingle Head, and too big for any Man's
&s;ingle Strength; too great for the Gra&s;p of
their E&s;tates, let them be what they will;
and the rich overgrown Trade&s;man has as
much need to be cautioned to keep within
Compa&s;s, and to avoid Projects and Projec|tors,
<PB N="18" REF="30">
as any the poore&s;t and younge&s;t Head
of them all; and in one Re&s;pect more, name|ly,
that the higher his Leap, the greater his
Fall; the more his Adventure, the more
Danger of his Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the rich well-increa&s;ed Trade&s;|man,
as he has a great Stock in Trade, &s;o
he has a great Fund of Credit; and he ought
to be more cautious than another Man, how
he does any Thing to le&s;&s;en his Character,
and wound his Credit.</P>
<P>THEY &s;ay of young Surgeons, they will
make de&s;perate Attempts, pu&s;h at all, and
&s;ometimes do great Cures by tho&s;e enterpri|&s;ing
Things, when a long-experienced, rich,
e&s;tabli&s;h'd Surgeon will not offer at them,
will not meddle or venture upon &s;uch Things,
becau&s;e he will not hazard his Reputation,
and bring his Credit upon the Stage in ca&s;e
of a Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>IF the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Trade&s;man is then in
Danger; if he wants to be caution'd in the
great Article of his Reputation; if it is ea&s;y
for the bige&s;t to gra&s;p beyond his Reach,
and, like <HI>Milo,</HI> in Pre&s;umption of his
Strength, be fa&s;ten'd in the Cleft till he is
devoured; then this &s;econd Volume of Di|rections
to the Compleat Trade&s;man, is as
much to the Purpo&s;e as the fir&s;t, and in &s;ome
re&s;pect more, becau&s;e the People this is di|rected
to are infinitely of more Con&s;equence
in ca&s;e of a Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="31">
A Trade&s;man, like a great Tree in a
thick Wood, if he falls, he is &s;ure to cru&s;h
a great deal of the Under-Wood which lies
within the Reach of his Boughs and Branches.
A young Trade&s;man mi&s;carries, and it reaches
but a little Way; a few Creditors are affect|ed,
and &s;ome Hurt is done: But if the over|grown
Trade&s;man falls, he &s;hakes the <HI>Ex|change,</HI>
as we call it; he dips deep among
other Trade&s;men; he pulls down here half
a Dozen, and there half a Score; and they
pull down others, and, like rolling Nine|pins,
they tumble down one another.</P>
<P>THE Fall of a great Trade&s;man is a Shock
even to the Trade it&s;elf; he &s;inks every
Man about him: As his Credit was good,
&s;o his Debts are large; if he owes Mo|ney,
'tis not by Hundreds, but by Thou|&s;ands,
which &s;trikes deep into the Pro|&s;perity
of all round about him, and the
whole Trade is &s;aid to &s;uffer by him: He
pulls down Families; and if twenty Top|ping
Trade&s;man fall with him, as is &s;ome|times
the Ca&s;e, tho&s;e twenty may bring down
every one two or three more, and &s;o on,
the De&s;truction is endle&s;s.</P>
<P>IT is not, therefore, for nothing that I
direct my fir&s;t Cautions to the&s;e great Trade&s;|men;
much le&s;s is it a u&s;ele&s;s Argument,
that I begin to u&s;e with them, <HI>viz,</HI> to in&s;i&s;t
upon their Hone&s;ty: Hone&s;ty is never out
of Sea&s;on to a Trade&s;man; but more e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="20" REF="32">
when he is grown great and rich, than
even at his Beginning. At fir&s;t we &s;ay there
is no Fear of him; he dares not be a
Knave; his Stock of Credit being ju&s;t in its
Ri&s;e, and the Foundation but ju&s;t laying,
he cannot but know that the lea&s;t unfair
Action expo&s;es him at once, and he is
blown up and gone.</P>
<P>BUT when the Trade&s;man is thriven, and
grown rich, his Character e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and
his Credit pa&s;t Danger, then he can act, as
we &s;ay, &s;ecure, and take greater Liberties
then he dur&s;t do before: Then is the Tryal
of his Principles, as an hone&s;t Man, and
then indeed is the mo&s;t Danger of his being
a K&mdash;.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, you'll &s;ay, that a Man &s;hould
be in mo&s;t Danger of turning a Knave, when
he has the lea&s;t Temptation to it. When
Men are poor, and are found guilty of little
Prevarications and Infractions of Principle,
Nece&s;&s;ity and Poverty is the Plea, and pa&s;&s;es
with &s;ome People for an Excu&s;e; though, by
the Way, it is no more &s;o, than Poverty is
a Plea at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> for committing a
Robbery or a Burglary.</P>
<P>BUT when we are &s;peaking comparatively,
'tis certainly a ju&s;t Way of arguing, that a
poor Man has a &s;tronger Temptation, and
may be the more an C$bject of our Pity,
when he makes a Slip, becau&s;e his Di&s;tre&s;s
was great: He has perhaps a Family, and
<PB N="21" REF="33">
his Circum&s;tances are low; the Temptation
&s;trong, the Nece&s;&s;ity great, and who knows
what he might do in this Ca&s;e? 'Tis a hard
Thing to &s;ee a Family &s;tarve, and having a
Loaf of Bread in his keeping, entru&s;ted with
him by a Neighbour, refu&s;e to cut it, be|cau&s;e
it was not his own; and where that
hone&s;t Man is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not know.
But that's out of my Way at pre&s;ent; I &s;hall
touch it again pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT if the poor Man has no Excu&s;e,
much le&s;s has the rich: If he has nothing
to &s;ay but his Poverty, what has the rich
Man to &s;ay: To be rich is to be without
Temptation; the rich Trade&s;man may have
the greate&s;t Opportunity of being a K&mdash;,
but he has much the lea&s;t Temptation to it,
or Excu&s;e for it.</P>
<P>AND yet &s;o it is, every Station of Life
has its Snares attending it, and every Degree
of Bu&s;ine&s;s has its Invitation to do Evil:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Nece&s;&s;ity tempts the poor Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Avarice tempts the rich.</ITEM>
</LIST>
It is true, they are both, to the la&s;t Degree,
criminal in yielding to the Temptation; but
the latter much more than the former; for
he is tempted by that which is in it&s;elf a
Crime: 'Tis not criminal to be poor; Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
is no Offence till it makes it&s;elf a
Snare, and places it&s;elf in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Stead:
<PB N="22" REF="34">
But <HI>Avarice</HI> is a Crime in its Nature; 'tis
a <HI>Devil</HI> in its very Kind, born of Hell, and
infu&s;ed in the very Soul it&s;elf: The fir&s;t is
an Accident to the Man, a Circum&s;tance of
Life, and comes from without; but Avarice
is within the Man; 'tis mingled, as we &s;ay,
with his Animal Life; it runs in his Blood;
it has in&s;inuated it&s;elf into his very Species,
and he is truly, as the Text &s;ays, <HI>drawn
a&s;ide by his own Lu&s;t, and enticed.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;peaking of Hone&s;ty in this Situa|tion,
the rich Trade&s;man is tempted in a
more violent Manner than the poor, and
perhaps is equally unfortified again&s;t the
Attack, con&s;equently he is every Way as
liable to fall into it. There are, for ought
I know or &s;ee, as many rich trading K&mdash;<HI>s</HI>
as poor ones, and, in proportion to their
Number, many more; and it cannot, there|fore,
be taken ami&s;s, that I begin this Work
with the Importance of this great Article of
Trading HONESTY.</P>
<P>IT is not le&s;s to the Purpo&s;e, in &s;peaking
to the &s;uperior Rank of Trade&s;men, to ad|moni&s;h
them of that dangerous Article of
Trading Tyranny; and that they &s;hould
avoid, as much as lies in them, making them|&s;elves
a Grievance in Trade, a Prejudice to
the Commerce it&s;elf, as well as to their
Neighbours; 'tis certain that a rich well|thriven
topping Trade&s;men may be a Ble&s;|&s;ing
to the Publick, as he is a Credit to it;
<PB N="23" REF="35">
and he may carry on a great Trade, without
being a Hindrance to others, e&s;pecially if
he will pre&s;erve the Title of a fair and ge|nerous
Trade&s;man, that is, willing to let
other Men live by him, and live with him
in Trade.</P>
<P>BUT if on the other Part he &s;ets up to be
an Engro&s;&s;er, that is to &s;ay, an Oppre&s;&s;or
in Trade; if by the Strength of his Cun|ning,
and the Strength of his Stock united,
he commits Spoil, and, as it may be truly
called, ravages the Trade, and runs down
his Neighbours, he is not only &s;o far a pub|lick
Grievance in Trade, but is not indeed
an hone&s;t Man; nor can he be called &s;o, for
he is far from doing as he would be willing
other Men &s;hould do by him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I have touch'd this Point as
gently as I could, allowing a needful Liber|ty
to explain the Gr$$vance, &s;o as to convince
this Trade&s;man that it is really &s;uch; that it
is not a fair Way of Trading; and that by
this Practice he becomes an Oppre&s;&s;or, in|deed,
a Plunderer, a meer Trading Dragoon,
and de&s;troys not the Trade&s;man only, but
the Trade it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told by &s;ome People, on
reading the fir&s;t Volume of this Work, that
having never duly con&s;idered the Thing it|&s;elf
in its full Latitude, as I have laid it
down, they did not look upon the Inland
Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to be any Thing
<PB N="24" REF="36">
&s;o con&s;iderable as they now find it is; that
the Trade&s;men, that is to &s;ay, the Shop-Keepers
and Warehou&s;e-Keepers of <HI>England,</HI>
were in their Opinion a mean Kind of Peo|ple,
not &s;o con&s;iderable either for their Num|ber,
their Wealth, or their U&s;efulne&s;s, as
they now find they are; and that they thought
my Work was accordingly of no great Im|portance.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on I thought it was need|ful
to let them &s;ee in a clear Light, how far
they are mi&s;taken, and how apparent it is
that the whole Weight of the Inland Com|merce
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is in the Hands of
the&s;e People who I call <HI>Trade&s;men,</HI> how
numerous and how con&s;iderable they are;
upon which indeed the Importance of this
Work will be abundantly &s;een.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, when I direct my Work to
the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and their
&s;everal Dependants, Servants, Journeymen,
Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am talking to above two
Millions of People, all living, as we may
call it, at their own Hands, Trucking, Bar|tering,
Buying, Selling, Turning and Twi&s;|ting,
this Way and that Way, all the needful
Subjects of Commerce, and every one pick|ing
a Penny by them in their Pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>PRODUCTION and Con&s;umption are the
two great Extreams of Commerce, as Gene|ration
and Corruption are the two great Ends
of Nature; in a Word, as Beginning and
<PB N="25" REF="37">
Ending are the two great Extreams of all
Things in the World, and even of the World
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have therefore &s;pent a little Time to
make the World &s;en&s;ible of the Magnitude
and Importance of this unknown and little
con&s;ider'd Article of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Inland
Trade, how and by what Means it is car|ried
on and manag'd to &s;uch a Prodigy as it
is; by which the Trade&s;men will know,
that it is not of a &s;mall Concern to the Na|tion,
that their Way is directed, and that they
are told in a familiar, plain, but effectual
Manner how they ought to guide their Af|fairs,
and how to act, &s;o as to be u&s;eful both
to their Country and to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>SOME De&s;criptions of the Commerce it&s;elf
may come in too of cour&s;e; and are ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the forming in the Trade&s;man's
Mind right Notions and ju&s;t Ideas of what
Part he is acting in the World; of what U&s;e he
is, to his native Country; and how to proceed,
&s;o that he may really be of U&s;e to him&s;elf,
and not become a Nu&s;ance or Offence either
to Poor or Rich.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome trading Vices too touch'd
at in this Work; which, though in re&s;pect
to the general Good, I found nece&s;&s;ary to
mention, yet, in re&s;pect to the Per&s;ons of the
Trade&s;men in general, I have touch'd them
but lightly, being willing to act the skilful
Surgeon, and make no deeper <HI>Inci&s;ions</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="38">
than are ab&s;olutely needful, in order to a
Cure.</P>
<P>THE rich Trade&s;man has his <HI>Faux pas,</HI>
and wrong Steps in his Conduct, as well as
the poor, and the old Standard as well as the
young Beginner; perhaps the latter are not the
ea&s;ie&s;t to cure, any more than the former; and
yet at the &s;ame Time they are not the lea&s;t
mi&s;chevious in their Con&s;equences, but the
more by the Ability of the Per&s;ons to do Hurt.</P>
<P>THE De&s;criptions of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade,
judged by the Proportion of its Appendixes,
&s;uch as the Taxes that may or have been le|vy'd
from it, the Expences of Freight and
Carriage of their Goods, as well by Coa&s;ting
and Fre&s;h-water Navigation as by Land|Carriage,
are Things which carry their own
Evidence along with them; and tho' they
may not be &s;o intelligible to tho&s;e who have
not been long experienced in Trade, and
may not have had Occa&s;ion to look criti|cally
into them, yet the more knowing Part
of the Trading World will &s;ee, that &s;ome of
the cleare&s;t Views of the Magnitude of our
Home Trade may be taken from them that
are any other Way to be had.</P>
<P>IF it be true that the City of <HI>London</HI>
only, be&s;ides Coals and Corn, two immen&s;e
Articles of Land and Water Carriage, re|ceives
every Year from the &s;everal Counties
of <HI>Che&s;hire, Wilt&s;hire, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>War|wick,</HI>
&s;o many thou&s;and Ton of Chee&s;e,
<PB N="27" REF="39">
and &s;o many thou&s;and Firkins of Butter,
be&s;ides what comes up in Pots, and &s;o
many thou&s;and Hog&s;heads of Syder, and the
like Proportion of other Things, the Car|riage
of which I have &s;poken of at length in
its Place, what mu&s;t the Carriage of all
the prodigious Trade in other Things amount
to, mo&s;t of all the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI>
being brought by Land, and &s;ome from
a hundred and fifty to two hundred Miles?
and what mu&s;t the Return of that Trade it|&s;elf
amount to?</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall dwell no longer upon gene|ral
Heads, or make Apologies for any Thing:
I begin with a Satisfaction that I &s;hall need
no Defence for any Thing &s;aid in this Book,
and con&s;equently no previous Excu&s;es: 'Tis
aim'd at the publick Good, evidently pur|&s;ues
it through all its Parts, and will con|vince
all its Readers of it by the Con&s;e|quence.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of HONESTY in Trade; how rare to be
found; how nece&s;&s;ary for the promoting
Commerce; what Scandal the Trade&s;men
generally lie under, about it; and what
the Meaning of it is; and how to be un|der&s;tood;
with a Word or two to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the Kinds of it.</HEAD>
<P>_WE had occa&s;ion to mention &s;ome|thing
of the Hone&s;ty requir'd in a
Trade&s;man in the fir&s;t Volume of this
Work; but as it had a quite diffe|rent
View from this, it is meet to make a
farther Enquiry into it.</P>
<P>HONESTY is indeed a nice Article, and is
not ea&s;ily to be de&s;crib'd; 'tis much more talk|ed
of than under&s;tood; more under&s;tood than
practis'd; and more practis'd too, than en|courag'd
or accepted. It is well de&s;crib'd
by one Author, to be a nice Plant, that grows
be&s;t in a barren Soil, and upon poor Ground;
for where the Soil is rich, and the Land en|cumber'd
with other Productions, 'tis apt to
be choak'd with the &s;preading Leaves of
other Plants, or be trod under Foot by the
Workmen that come to take Care of other
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="41">
IT does not thrive be&s;t, indeed, among
the Money-getting Part of the World, and
therefore it may be, that it is not &s;o culti|vated
and taken Care of among our Trade&s;|men
as it might be, and as it were to be
wi&s;h'd it had been; in which Ca&s;e we might
perhaps have had a better Crop: But yet I
may let you &s;ee where it is nouri&s;h'd too,
with pretty good Succe&s;s, even in Commerce,
e&s;pecially among our Home Traders, to
their Honour be it &s;poken; and 'tis to be
hoped they will encourage others to fair
Dealings too by their Example.</P>
<P>HONESTY, however de&s;picably &s;ome &s;peak
of it, and however ragged and forlorn it may
look at pre&s;ent among us, may have a Time
to come in play again; and tho' it &s;eems to
be dropp'd pretty much out of Trade ever
&s;ince the Year <HI>Twenty,</HI> when &s;o many hone&s;t
Men turn'd K&mdash;, and Con&s;cience was
Bubble-ridden and Stock-jobb'd till it came
under PAR, yet Time may come, in &s;pite of
Companies, and Companies of Sharpers, that
<HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> may be able to appear upon <HI>Change</HI>
again; whether ever it may in the ALLEY, or
not, I dare not &s;ay.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed a great many Preten|ders
to <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> in the World, and a great ma|ny
among Trade&s;men too, as well as among
other People; and e&s;pecially tho&s;e who make
a great Noi&s;e with their Hone&s;ty, who when
they come to be examined a little more nar|rowly
<PB N="30" REF="42">
into the Particulars, it is ea&s;y to di&s;co|ver
they know nothing of the Matter; and
indeed, 'tis a Rule that &s;eldom fails among
Trade&s;men, whether it is the &s;ame with
other People, or no, I will not determine,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have not always the mo&s;t
<HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> that make the mo&s;t Noi&s;e about it,
who talk mo&s;t of it, and &s;eem to put the
greate&s;t Value upon it: As it is in Religion,
They have not always the mo&s;t A&s;&s;urance of
Salvation, that &s;upport their common Affirma|tives
with that ordinary, tho' extraordinary
Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>As I hope to be &s;av'd;</HI> &s;o they
do not &s;peak mo&s;t Truth, that are always &s;wea|ring
by their Troth; nor have they the mo&s;t
<HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> that are always boa&s;ting of it: Nay,
if I may advi&s;e the Trade&s;man, I would re|commend
it to him as a needful Policy, if
it were no more, to leave off &s;wearing and
bla&s;ting him&s;elf behind the Compter: As to
the Religion of it, that's another Point; I
am not &s;peaking of it at this Time, nor are
all Trade&s;men fit to be talk'd to in that Man|ner.</P>
<P>But
as I am talking to Money-getting
Men, who are pu&s;hing their Fortunes, as
I may call it, by Whole&s;ale and Retale, I
would advi&s;e them to abate that Part out of
their Shop and Warehou&s;e Rhetorick, upon
this Account, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Body believes them
one Jot the more for it; nor is it any Ad|vantage
to them in their Bu&s;inc&s;s, or Credit
to their Character.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="43">
AFFIRMING Things in Trade upon the
Faith o&s; &s;uch A&s;&s;everations, is bearing Wit|ne&s;s
to them&s;elves, and &s;tands for nothing;
and that which is &s;till wor&s;e, is, that it is &s;o
often done to &s;upport Cheat and Fraud, and
&s;o &s;eldom in Aid of Truth, that it really leaves
the Veracity of the Trade&s;man much wor&s;e
than it found him; and I mu&s;t needs &s;ay,
adds to the general Scandal upon Shop-Keep|ers,
namely, That whatever they may in
other Places, they are never to be minded
behind the Compter; that tho' you may be|lieve
what they &s;ay in another Place, you are
not to believe what they &s;wear when they are
there; &s;o that 'tis Part of the Art and My|ftery
of the Profe&s;&s;ion, to &s;wear and for&s;wear
in the Shop and the Warehou&s;e; and there's
no Sin in it, for they could not live without
it.</P>
<P>HENCE comes that common Saying among
&s;ome People, who perhaps want Charity more
than they wont Knowledge, <HI>That all Trade&s;|men
are Knaves;</HI> and 'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
they &s;hould be &s;o; that it cannot be
otherwi&s;e; that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould
be hone&s;t Men; and if they were not all
Rogues, they would break, and be undone;
they could not live or get their Bread; and
the like.</P>
<P>THIS is a terrible Attack upon the poor
Trade&s;man; and were it true, no hone&s;t Man
would put his Son Apprentice to a Trade&s;man
<PB N="32" REF="44">
upon any Account whatever; for who would
bind his Child to the <HI>Devil?</HI> (for 'tis all
one;) who would put his Son Apprentice
to that which mu&s;t of con&s;equence carry
him to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and make a Knave of
him unavoidably by the con&s;equence of
that Thing?</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;men tell you, indeed, to ex|cu&s;e
them&s;elves, that 'tis the Con&s;equences
of Trade; that they are not &s;o as Men, or
as in any of their other Conduct, but only
as Trade&s;men; that Trade is not to be car|ried
on without Roguery: A Trade&s;man
to be hone&s;t, &s;ay they! 'tis again&s;t the Na|ture
of the Thing: They mu&s;t lye, and
cheat, and cozen, or they could neither
buy or &s;ell; 'tis a grand e&s;&s;ential Part of
Commerce; they that deal with them know
it, and expect it, and indeed are in part the
Rea&s;on and Occa&s;ion of it; nay, the Buyers
are the Aggre&s;&s;ors: Shew a Cu&s;tomer a Piece
of Goods, 'tis natural for them to &s;light
and di&s;parage them: '<HI>Tis naught, 'tis naught,</HI>
&s;ays the Buyer; but when he goes away, he
boa&s;teth. <HI>Solomon,</HI> you &s;ee, <HI>blames the Buyer
more than the Seller, or rather than the Seller.</HI></P>
<P>BUYING and Selling, as is ob&s;erved in
the former Volume, is but a Piece of
Jargon betweeen the Shop-Keeper and the
Cu&s;tomer, giving one another the <HI>Lye</HI> for
half an Hour together, in all the civil Lan|guage
imaginable: One &s;ays 'tis very good,
<PB N="33" REF="45">
and the other 'tis very bad; and both Sides
&s;wearing to what they &s;ay, 'tis nothing but
<HI>you lye,</HI> and <HI>you lye:</HI> Indeed you lye, <HI>Madam;</HI>
and in Troth you lye, <HI>Sir;</HI> and then they go
on: And there's no buying or &s;elling without
it; in a word, there's no keeping a Shop
open without it: And where is the <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI>
of it all the while?</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, if this Part were true; I mean,
that there could be no keeping the Shop open
without it, then it would con&s;equently fol|low,
indeed, as it is alledg'd, and the Tradef|man
could not be an hone&s;t Man; that they
were all K&mdash;s and R&mdash;s; and that it
could not be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT Thanks be to Virtue and good Mean|ing
that Fact is not true; 'tis certainly a Slan|der
upon a Million of People in this I&s;land,
who, we have Rea&s;on to believe, are as hone&s;t
as their Neighbours; and I make no Que&s;|tion,
but it is as po&s;&s;ible for a Trade&s;man to
be as hone&s;t as any other Man, and yet to
carry on his Trade too; and I'll make it ap|pear
to be &s;o, with allowing all that can be
&s;aid to the contrary.</P>
<P>BUT pray take me right, and ob&s;erve, when
I &s;ay <HI>tis po&s;&s;ible,</HI> I do not deny but it is
difficult; a Trade&s;man may be an hone&s;t Man,
but I do not &s;ay 'tis &s;o ea&s;y to him to be &s;o,
as it is for a Man out of Trade; there are
more Snares, more Ob&s;tructions in his Way,
and more Allurements to him to turn Knave,
<PB N="34" REF="46">
than in any other Employment, that I will
not di&s;pute.</P>
<P>BUT then, the Argument is highly in his
Favour, that as the Difficulty is the greater,
the greater is his Prai&s;e, and the greater his
Reward, and, which is to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e
in particular, the greater is the Value of him
as to Men. An hone&s;t Trade&s;man is a Jewel
indeed, and ought to be valued, and indeed
is valued wherever he is found.</P>
<P>NOR is it the Rarity only which makes
a Trade&s;man of Integrity be valued &s;o much
among his Neighbours: Be&s;ides, perhaps I
am not &s;o much of the Opinion of the Rarity
of them as &s;ome are; but that, on the contrary,
there are a great Number. But 'tis the U&s;e|fulne&s;s
of&s;uch Trade&s;man that renders them &s;o
valuable: A Trade&s;man perfectly and nicely
hone&s;t, &s;incere, and without Guile, is one
of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Things in a Common|wealth,
and which the Publick &s;tands often
Times in great need of.</P>
<P>AN hone&s;t Trade&s;men is more capable of
&s;erving his Country, either in a publick or
a private Capacity, than almo&s;t any other
Man of the &s;ame Figure. He is nece&s;&s;ary
on many Occa&s;ions to the Government, to
the People, to publick, to private Intere&s;ts;
and indeed almo&s;t to every Body, and to
every Thing.</P>
<P>BUT fir&s;t let us &s;peak of the Difficulty of
a Trade&s;man's being hone&s;t: He has without
<PB N="35" REF="47">
Que&s;tion more Ob&s;tructions to his Hone&s;ty,
more Opportunities, and more Importunities
to Knavery, than are more within any other
Station of Life; every Day clande&s;tine Ad|vantages
of Trade offer them&s;elves to him,
&s;ecret Occa&s;ions to enrich him&s;elf, &s;upplant
his Neighbour, and put a Trick upon the
World, for his private Advantage: The
Wedge of Gold, and the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Gar|ment
&s;hew them&s;elves every now and then,
as they did to <HI>Achan;</HI> and he has a private
Hint to take them, and hide them among
his Stuff; and 'tis hard for him to re&s;i&s;t it.
Here he can over-reach his Cu&s;tomer, there
Bite his Country Manufacturer; this Way he
can impo&s;e upon the Rich, there devour the
Poor; and as getting Money by all po&s;&s;ible
(fair) Methods is his proper Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
what he opens his Shop for, or keep his
Warehou&s;e for, 'tis not the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in
the World to di&s;tingui&s;h between fair and
foul, when 'tis again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Add to this, that when a Thing &s;omething
doubtful happens in his Way, and he has an
Opportunity to get Money, 'tis not very ea|&s;y
for him to determine it to be di&s;hone&s;t,
again&s;t him&s;elf; and a Trade&s;man may be
too apt to be partial to his own Intere&s;t, and
judge in his own Favour.</P>
<P>THIS at lea&s;t, as it expo&s;es him to the Ha|zard
of Di&s;hone&s;ty, &s;o he often bears the
<PB N="36" REF="48">
Cen&s;ure of being di&s;hone&s;t when he really
was not &s;o.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd,
that a Trade&s;man walks upon the Edge of
the Precipice, and &s;ometimes goes &s;o near
the utmo&s;t Brink, that to make a &s;mall Slip
is almo&s;t unavoidable; and this gives the Oc|ca&s;ion
of &s;aying as above, that he cannot be
hone&s;t; he is &s;urrounded with others that are
not hone&s;t, and they will reproach him to wa&s;h
their own Character, and rank him with them|&s;elves,
if they can: As my Lord <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI>
&s;ays of the Game&s;ters, there is no playing
fair among them; if you don't cheat as they
do, they will &s;ay you do, and that's the &s;ame
Thing, as he &s;ays,
<Q><L>If with known Cheats you'll play upon the
Square,</L>
<L>You'll be undone.&mdash;</L>
<L>For Hone&s;ty's again&s;t all common Sen&s;e;</L>
<L>Men mu&s;t be Knaves, 'tis in their own
Defence.</L>
<L>Nor will weak Truth your Reputation
&s;ave:</L>
<L>The Knaves will all agree to call you
Knave.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF then you will turn the Words a little,
and in&s;tead of &s;aying a Trade&s;man cannot be
an hone&s;t Man, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould
be hone&s;t, and that all Trade&s;men are Knaves,
<PB N="37" REF="49">
you will expre&s;s it thus, That 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
for a Trade&s;man not to be thought a Knave;
or that every Trade&s;man, or all Trade&s;men,
are thougnt Knaves, that is to &s;ay, by &s;ome
or other; then it can hardly be contradicted.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis the hone&s;t Trade&s;man's Mercy;
that to be a Knave, and to be call'd a Knave
are oftentimes extremely different; a Man
may be under the Power of gro&s;s Abu&s;es;
&s;trong Calumny attacks him, and the Knaves
all agree to call him <HI>Knave,</HI> and yet he may
be truly and &s;incerely hone&s;t for all that.</P>
<P>THIS would lead me into a ju&s;t Exclama|tion
again&s;t the abhorr'd Practice of Calum|ny,
rai&s;ing Clamour, and ca&s;ting Dirt at
the Characters of innocent Men, or taking
Plea&s;ure in blackening Mens Characters for
Trifles, and for &s;mall Matters, with the many
other Excur&s;ions of the Tongue, loading
Men with Reproach, which they do not
de&s;erve.</P>
<P>IT is indeed an abhorr'd Practice; and yet we
find is &s;o general, that 'tis hard to meet with
a &s;potle&s;s Character; 'tis difficult for a Man
to act &s;o as not to de&s;erve Blame in any
Thing, and much more difficult not to bear
the Reproach of it, whether he de&s;erve it or no.
Trade&s;men walk, as I &s;ay, on the Brink of Of|fence;
they mu&s;t &s;ometimes &s;plit a Hair, as 'tis
called, between Innocence and Fault, between
Hone&s;t and Di&s;hone&s;t; and who can do this,
<PB N="38" REF="50">
and not fall under Reproach on one Side or
on the other.</P>
<P>To be hone&s;t, therefore, and to have the
Reputation of it, as I &s;aid above, are two
Things, and va&s;tly different from one ano|ther:
There may be, and I know there are,
a great many Trade&s;men that are nicely ho|ne&s;t,
intentionally &s;o, even to Perfection;
for Intentional Hone&s;ty may be perfect, what|ever
actual Hone&s;ty may be: I &s;ay I know
many are &s;o Intentionally, and <HI>actually too,</HI>
in their utmo&s;t Endeavour: But the Knaves
will never cea&s;e to call them all <HI>Knaves,</HI> as
well as them&s;elves, and to brand them with
the odious Title, whether ju&s;t, or no; and
while it is &s;o, how mu&s;t an hone&s;t Man, that
is really &s;o, demean him&s;elf? how &s;hall he
be able to walk, and act, and pre&s;erve him|&s;elf?</P>
<P>WHEN
I &s;ay pre&s;erve him&s;elf, I mu&s;t ex|plain
the Meaning of it a little, or I &s;hall not
be under&s;tood. A Trade&s;man has two Arti|cles
which are and ought to be his particu|lar
Care to pre&s;erve in the World; and by
pre&s;erving them, he pre&s;erves him&s;elf.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His Character,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His Property.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To pre&s;erve both together is exceeding
difficult, and &s;ometimes impo&s;&s;ible; a cla|mouring
noi&s;y impertinent Man, but not a
<PB N="39" REF="51">
Trade&s;man, nor of his own Profe&s;&s;ion, quar|rels
with him unju&s;tly, abu&s;es, in&s;ults him,
I mean in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; demands &s;uch and
&s;uch Things which are not his Due to de|mand,
or the other Man's Due to pay; the
hone&s;t Man is in a Strait; if he yields it,
he gives up his Right, wrongs his Family;
wherefore he in&s;i&s;ts upon it, and defends him|&s;elf,
and he cannot be hone&s;t to him&s;elf, if
he does not; this is <HI>pre&s;erving his Proper|ty;</HI>
why then, he is called a Knave, a Cheat,
a Rogue, and <HI>all Trade&s;men are the &s;ame;</HI>
and thus the general Slander begins.</P>
<P>AGAIN, it is unavoidable but that where
there is &s;uch a prodigious Number of Trade&s;|men,
as there are in this Nation, and &s;uch
an infinite Variety of Di&s;putes, and Ca&s;es
which happen among them; their Bu&s;ine&s;s and
Number, not being to be calculated or expre&s;|&s;ed,
much le&s;s to be gue&s;s'd at; I &s;ay it is un|avoidable,
but that there mu&s;t happen al&s;o
abundance of Di&s;putes, Quarrels, Cavils,
and Contentions among them: It is evident
in one particular Ca&s;e, which I have often ob|&s;erved,
and you will find it &s;o if you enquire
among the Lawyers, <HI>viz.</HI> that when Trade
declines, their Bu&s;ine&s;s falls off; and as Trade
revives, <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-Hall</HI> is full of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THE
Meaning is plain; the more Trade,
the more Suits at Law: Men differ, di&s;pute,
contend, and appeal to the Law about their
<PB N="40" REF="52">
Bargains, Debts, Accounts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then, not
being able to determine Right and Wrong
among them&s;elves, the Lawyers come in
to adju&s;t Things for them: Bu&s;ine&s;s is intri|cate,
and Accidents in Trade numerous, and
full of Niceties, and this appears in their
&s;o frequently quarrelling with one another.</P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, that where two Parties
quarrel, and go to Law, both, generally
&s;peaking, think they are right, and their
Oppo&s;er wrong: He that &s;ays he &s;uffers
Wrong, fails not to reproach the other with
injurious Language; blames him for Oppre&s;|&s;ion,
Fraud, Fal&s;hood, and the like. In a
word, it &s;eldom happens but that both Sides
call Names, and this of <HI>Knave</HI> principally,
and in the fir&s;t Place; and where is the
Trade&s;man that does not both give and re|ceive
this good Language?</P>
<P>THUS it is owing to the Trade&s;men them|&s;elves
that they obtain the Name of <HI>Knave,</HI>
and Cheat, Injurious, a Plunderer, and in a
word, a di&s;hone&s;t Man: They generally get
it from one another, and they are the fir&s;t
to reproach one another; &s;o that they have
no Body to blame &s;o much as them&s;elves, for
the Scandal, or rather Slander mentioned
above, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is impo&s;&s;ible for a Trade&s;|man
to be an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>BUT to bring this Matter, to talk Sen&s;e
and Truth both at once, if that be po&s;&s;ible,
<HI>and,</HI> as we &s;ay proverbially, <HI>to &s;addle the
<PB N="41" REF="53">
right Hor&s;e,</HI> the following Particulars will go
a great way in &s;tating the Ca&s;e fairly be|tween
the trading World and the re&s;t of
Mankind.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. IT mu&s;t be granted it requires a great
deal of Care and Circum&s;pection in a
Trade&s;man to be hone&s;t, and to de&s;erve
the Title of an hone&s;t Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THERE are indeed abundance of Trade&s;|men
that are not hone&s;t Men, and who&s;e
Conduct has a&s;&s;i&s;ted very much in rai|&s;ing
this general Scandal upon all the re&s;t,
<HI>viz. That they cannot be hone&s;t.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But yet 'tis very po&s;&s;ible, and Exam|ples
are very frequent in the Ca&s;e, where
Trade&s;men are as &s;trictly and as exactly
hone&s;t as any Men can be.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IT is alledged again by the Enemy, that
true it is, or it may be true rather, that there
are many hone&s;t Trade&s;men who are hone&s;t
in the Language of Trade, and are e&s;teemed
&s;o among their own Sort, that is, among
Trade&s;men; but then, &s;ay they, that is Ho|ne&s;ty
among Trade&s;men, that is not Ho|ne&s;ty
with other Men; and &s;o they enter into
the Merits of the Trade&s;man's Way of deal|ing
in all the &s;everal Branches of it; and
&s;etting up our Saviour's Rule for a Standard
of Uprightne&s;s, they in&s;i&s;t upon it, that
there is not an hone&s;t Trade&s;man in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> namely, who <HI>does by all Men</HI> no|thing
<PB N="42" REF="54">
but as he would <HI>be willing they &s;hould
do by him:</HI> 'Tis the Golden Rule, and ought
to be the Standard of a Trade&s;man's Ma|nagement
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<Q>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</Q>
<P>THIS is a Rule without Spot indeed, a
perfect and unexceptionable Rule, and will
hold for an unalterable Law as long as
there is a Trade&s;man left in the World;
but it may be &s;aid, indeed, Where is the
Man that acts thus? where is the Man who&s;e
&s;potle&s;s Integrity reaches it? who has kept
up to the Height, who has govern'd his Ac|tions
&s;o regularly, and with &s;uch Exactne&s;s,
as to &s;ay, <HI>All this have I kept from my
Youth?</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, I much que&s;tion whether that
Man be alive, that can &s;ay thus of him&s;elf
ab&s;olutely; but I cannot doubt in the lea&s;t
but that there are many Trade&s;men that, aba|ting
human Infirmity, may &s;ay, That they
have endeavour'd after &s;uch a Perfection;
who if they fall, ri&s;e again; if they &s;lip, are
the fir&s;t to reproach them&s;elves with it; re|pent,
and re-a&s;&s;ume their upright Conduct;
the general Tenor of who&s;e Lives is to be
hone&s;t, and to do fair Things. And this is
what we may be allow'd to call <HI>an hone&s;t
Man;</HI> for as to Perfection, we are not look|ing
for it in Life; 'tis enough if it be to be
<PB N="43" REF="55">
found in the Intention and De&s;ire: Sincerity of
De&s;ire is Chri&s;tian Perfection; Heaven will ac|cept
it for &s;uch, and we ought to do &s;o: He that
objects &s;hould be &s;ure that he has a greater
Degree of Perfection to produce for him&s;elf;
but that is not our Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>To de&s;ire to be hone&s;t, is Hone&s;ty; becau&s;e
he that does &s;o, will not fail to endeavour,
by all po&s;&s;ible Means, to act hone&s;tly in
every Thing he does; if not, he will give
but very &s;lender Te&s;timony of the Sincerity
of his hone&s;t Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Now let a Trade&s;man's Difficulties be as
great as they will, be his Snares as many as
are rea&s;onably to be &s;uppo&s;ed; be the Impor|tunities
of his Advantage how great &s;oever,
yet he may both &s;incerely de&s;ire, and endea|your
to act hone&s;tly in every Thing: And
he that does &s;o, and who, if he &s;lips at any
Time, both repents and reforms, re-affumes
his Re&s;olutions to do hone&s;tly, and to make
Reparations where he has done Wrong, that
Man &s;hould pa&s;s for an hone&s;t Man with
me, as long as I have any Rea&s;on or Rule to
judge of an hone&s;t Man by.</P>
<Q><L>He that repents, and does his Crimes amend,</L>
<L>Stands next to him, that never did offend.</L></Q>
<P>AND why is it not to be allowed to a
Trade&s;man to repent, and reform: This would
not only &s;hut half the World out of our own
<PB N="44" REF="56">
good Opinion, but would lock them out of
Heaven too. If it were true, that a Trade&s;man
could not be an hone&s;t Man, and could not
reform or repent, we might e'en &s;ay of them,
as the Di&s;ciples &s;aid to our Saviour about the
rich Men, <HI>Who then can be &s;av'd?</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, this would be a Step to make all
the Trade&s;men be, what you talk them up to
be; to make them De&s;peradoes; and &s;eeing
that by Profe&s;&s;ion they mu&s;t be K&mdash;s,
make them conclude, they can be no other,
and &s;o make them re&s;olve to be as bad as they
can. If you once per&s;uade a Man that he
can never be hone&s;t, you open the Door to
him never to endeavour it.</P>
<P>BUT why may not a Trade&s;man be hone&s;t?
Is it becau&s;e he endeavours to &s;ell his Goods
as dear as he can, and to buy his Goods as
cheap as he can? I &s;ee no room to make out
the Charge upon that Foot, if he does not
yield to &s;ome di&s;hone&s;t Means, to per&s;uade
the Buyer to think a Thing to be what it is
not. Now how far the Seller of the Goods
is bound to di&s;cover every Thing in the Goods
he &s;ells that may be to its Di&s;advantage, any
more than he is to conceal any Thing that
may be to its Advantage, is a Point not yet
&s;ettled in the World, nor perhaps ever will
be.</P>
<P>NOR are the Bounds and Limits of Ho|ne&s;ty
&s;trictly &s;ettled betwixt the Buyer and
Seller. How far the former may recommend
<PB N="45" REF="57">
his Goods; how far the latter may decry
and di&s;parage them; how far the Seller
(Trade&s;man) may &s;et them off with Flouri&s;hes
and Rhetorick; and what Art he may u&s;e to
per&s;uade the Cu&s;tomer to buy; and how far
the Cu&s;tomer may &s;trive and &s;truggle with
the Trade&s;man, by running down the Good|ne&s;s
of his Goods, and le&s;&s;ening the Value
of them, in order to bring him to abate.</P>
<P>THE Limits between the&s;e two, I &s;ay,
are not &s;ettled with re&s;pect to their Hone&s;ty
or Di&s;hone&s;ty; and &s;o it remains a Difficulty,
how far the Trade&s;man is to be cen&s;ur'd on
that Account; but then I mu&s;t add too, that
if it be upon this Foot that the Trade&s;man
is cen&s;ur'd as di&s;hone&s;t, and that all Trade&s;|men
that practi&s;e the Art of &s;etting off their
Goods by the Help of Words are Knaves,
then I mu&s;t add, that all Buyers, who with
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Chap &s;ays, <HI>'Tis Naught, 'tis
Naught;</HI> that is to &s;ay, endeavours to depre|ciate
and run down the Goods he buys by
the Help of the &s;ame Artifice, is a Knave
too, and that as much as the Trade&s;man;
and &s;o we &s;hall bring almo&s;t all Mankind in|to
the Charge; and it will not be true only that
the Trade&s;man cannot be hone&s;t, but in Fact,
no Man that has any Thing to do in the
World with the Poor, or with the Rich, with
the Buyer or with the Seller, with a Labour|er,
or the Ma&s;ter, with one or with another,
can be hone&s;t. But we are all K&mdash;<HI>s,</HI> and
<PB N="46" REF="58">
the Sons of K&mdash;<HI>s,</HI> Man and Mother's
Child; not an hone&s;t Wretch left on the Face
of God's Globe, no, not one.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is carrying the Charge too
far, running up Things too high; and you
have, like DAVID in another Ca&s;e, <HI>&s;aid in your
Ha&s;te, that all Men are Lyars:</HI> And on the
other Hand, I mu&s;t in Vindication of the
Trade&s;men of this Nation &s;ay two or three
Things of them:</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They are, generally &s;peaking, fair
Traders and punctual hone&s;t Dealers; there
may be Sharpers and double-dealing Knaves
among them, but generally &s;peaking, there
is a Face of Hone&s;ty upon the whole
Body.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I believe it may be &s;aid of them
without boa&s;ting, or without Partiality, that
they are rather hone&s;ter and fairer in their
Dealings here, than other Nations, I mean
than other trading Nations.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to &s;ay, 'tis a Proof
of this, that I ob&s;erve there is greater per|&s;onal
Credit given in Trade in this Nation,
<HI>that is,</HI> Men are more tru&s;ted upon their
Words, upon their Hone&s;ty, than in any
other Nation in the World.</P>
<P>IF you were to tru&s;t a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian</HI> in <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI>
upon his Parole, he would not only cheat
you, but would boa&s;t of it the next Day,
laugh in your Face, and ask you how you
came to be &s;uch a Fool to tru&s;t him: If you
<PB N="47" REF="59">
part with your Goods to any of the wander|ing
Dealers of the Ea&s;tern World, without
the Effects to be exchang'd &s;ecur'd in your
Hands, you may expect to hear no more of
them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>France</HI> and in <HI>Italy</HI> Men trade with the
utmo&s;t Jealou&s;y and Caution; and except it
is among the Merchants and Men of great
Dealing, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd Reputation in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
you &s;ee very little fair punctual Dealing
among the meaner People.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England</HI> a Man &s;ells his Goods up|on
Tru&s;t, and delivers them to an ordinary
Shop-Keeper or Retailer, and that to a con|&s;iderable
Quantity and Value, with the
greate&s;t Tranquility and Ea&s;e of Mind in the
World, and has as punctual and hone&s;t Deal|ing,
as if he had a Bond and Security for
Payment; and a Warehou&s;e-Keeper &s;leeps as
ea&s;y, that has &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and Pounds
owing him among the Country Trade&s;men
and Shop-Keepers, upon the meer Credit of
their Words, being what we call a Book-Debt:
I &s;ay, he &s;leeps as ea&s;y, tho' his whole
Fortune lies thus di&s;pers'd, perhaps in all the
principal Towns in <HI>England,</HI> or mo&s;t of them,
as if it was all in Ca&s;h, in the Bank, or laid
out in Land, and in his full Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THIS is the Fruit of the Trade&s;man's Ho|ne&s;ty;
fair and ju&s;t Dealing rai&s;es Credit,
and for ought I &s;ee, is the only Foundation
upon which Credit in Trade is rais'd; and if
<PB N="48" REF="60">
&s;o, as the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Credit in Trade, is the
greate&s;t in the World at this Time, I mean
in their home Trade, it is no unju&s;t Inference
to draw from it, that their Hone&s;ty is in Pro|portion
greate&s;t al&s;o. But I &s;hall have occa|&s;ion
to &s;peak of this again in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I return to the De&s;cription of this nice
Article call'd Hone&s;ty, as it re&s;pects Trade,
as I &s;aid before; the Limits of it are not
duly &s;ettled, and we have not &s;et up a &s;tated
Rule to judge it by. Hence we are frequent|ly
wrangling about it, and every Day cal|ling
Truth Fal&s;hood, and Ju&s;tice Knavery;
while on the other Hand, the K&mdash;calls
him&s;elf an hone&s;t Man, and the greate&s;t
Frauds are carried on under a Mask of the
utmo&s;t Nicety. Hypocri&s;y is cover'd with
a Habit or Dre&s;s, re&s;embling Hone&s;ty, as a
Whore puts on the Habit of a <HI>Nun</HI> at the
<HI>Ball,</HI> and covers the <HI>Courte&s;an</HI> with the <HI>Re|ligieu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI>
like Silver, &s;hould have a Stan|dard
for the E&s;&s;ay; and then &s;hould receive
a Stamp of Current upon it, as the Silver
does that of a Coinage; after which there
would be no room to que&s;tion it: But if
any one doubted, the Touch would deter|mine
its Quality to be Sterling. It is indeed
very injurious to the World, that this is not
done; tho' how to bring it about is &s;omething
difficult; for there are a great many Sorts of
Hone&s;ty in the World, as well of the right
<PB N="49" REF="61">
true Hone&s;ty, as of the pretended or coun|terfeit
Hone&s;ty.</P>
<Q>1. As I ob&s;erv'd before, there are &s;everal
Degrees of Hone&s;ty, and &s;everal kinds
of it, even of what we call true Ho|ne&s;ty,
as there is Silver of a coar&s;er
or finer kind, &s;ome of one Country,
&s;ome of another; for Example, they
tell us of &s;everal Kinds of Hone&s;ty,
even here at home, &s;uch as <HI>York&s;hire</HI>
Hone&s;ty, for Example; which, however,
&s;ome People, who call them&s;elves good
Judges too, don't care to take for Stan|dard
Hone&s;ty, and yet when you come
into <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> they tell you, their Coun|try
Hone&s;ty is of the fine&s;t Kind in the
World, and that it is farther North that
the counterfeit Hone&s;ty grows; and tho'
I have been far North too, yet I don't
find, but their Hone&s;ty is as good as
other People's, and other People's Kna|very
as bad as theirs; for Hone&s;ty, in a
Word, is Hone&s;ty, let it grow where it
will, and let People &s;et up what they
will for Hone&s;ty, yet the Counter|feit
will di&s;cover it &s;elf wherever it is
found.</Q>
<P>THUS in &s;ome Part of the World, Cun|ning
is call'd Hone&s;ty, and pa&s;&s;es Current
too, without any con&s;iderable Exception;
<PB N="50" REF="62">
and which is more wonderful, there is a
Country not far off, neither where they take
Simplicity for Hone&s;ty, and Men pa&s;s for
hone&s;t, becau&s;e they are Fools; which Ho|ne&s;ty,
by the way, like the old bra&s;s Far|things,
will go but a very little Way from
Home, and if it comes abroad among People
where their Hone&s;ty is true Sterling, it is
pre&s;ently di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>THERE is another kind of <HI>Hone&s;ty,</HI> which
they call <HI>New-England Hone&s;ty,</HI> and which
they &s;ay, is the mo&s;t dangerous of any of
the Counterfeits. But I cannot &s;ee that it
has done any great Harm in the World; which
&s;ome malicious People intimate is, becau&s;e
they keep it at Home pretty much; and that
they &s;ay is, becau&s;e it is known, and &s;o will
not pa&s;s abroad: But of that I have no Room
to di&s;cour&s;e fully in this Work, neither is it
to my Purpo&s;e. If our Friends in <HI>New-England</HI>
have been impo&s;ed upon, and a coun|terfeit
Hone&s;ty has been introduc'd, and
made to pa&s;s for Current Hone&s;ty among
them, I doubt not but they will call it into
their Mint, and recoin it; and then, without
Doubt, it will come out as good Standard,
Current Hone&s;ty as ours is in <HI>Europe;</HI> &s;o pray,
Gentlemen before we examine other People's
Hone&s;ty too far, let us take Care of our
own.</P>
<P>THERE is, as I have &s;aid, a great Variety
in the kinds of Hone&s;ty among our &s;elves;
<PB N="51" REF="63">
and this is that which touches the Point that
I am upon. For when I in&s;i&s;t, that there is a
kind of Hone&s;ty in our Dealings, and in Trade,
and that a Trade&s;man may be an hone&s;t Man as
above, I am pre&s;ently an&s;wered in this gibing
Way: Yes, you Trade&s;men may have &s;ome Ho|ne&s;ty;
but then that pa&s;&s;es for Hone&s;ty among
you, which is not Hone&s;ty with other Men; for
Example, &s;ay they, lying, and cheating, &s;et|ting
off bad Goods for good, damag'd and
unfini&s;hed for merchantable, and the like;
this is call'd Hone&s;ty behind the Compter,
but is not &s;o any where el&s;e; nor will the
Trade&s;man call it &s;o in any but him&s;elf; ex|cu&s;ing
his own Practice, with this very ordinary
and coar&s;e Plea, <HI>viz. That he cannot help it;</HI>
he cannot carry on his Trade without it;
which la&s;t we grant to be true, &s;ay they, and
therefore add, that a Trade&s;man cannot be
an hone&s;t Man; he mu&s;t be a K&mdash;by Vir|tue
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>he cannot help it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT all this is an&s;wered in this General,
by telling you, that 'tis a vulgar Error; that
the Trade&s;men mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;h'd, as the
re&s;t of the World are, into hone&s;t and di&s;ho|ne&s;t;
that perhaps there are Men who thus
plead the Nece&s;&s;ity of their Bu&s;ine&s;s for it; but
that on the other Hand, there are Men that
do not act thus, nor do they find any Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
for it; but can, and do carry on their
Trades very well without it, and thereby wit|ne&s;s
that others might do &s;o too.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="64">
THIS <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> then con&s;i&s;ts in a general Pro|bity
of Conduct; punctual keeping their Word,
making the Honour of Trade, (as it is call'd,)
be their Guide, and their Word be equal to
their Bond in all Ca&s;es. I knew a Trade&s;|man
that was never &s;ued at Law by any Bo|dy,
and yet carried on a very con&s;iderable
Bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>London</HI> for almo&s;t fifty Years,
having no Quarrel in Trade with any Man;
if he had any con&s;iderable Debt owing him,
that he could not get in, he u&s;ed &s;uch Forbear|ance
and Lenity with others, that he never
arre&s;ted any Man in his Life. It is true, he
might be a Lo&s;er by that Part, and was &s;o;
but that was a Damage only to him&s;elf: But
he pre&s;erv'd the Character of an hone&s;t and
an upright Dealer to the la&s;t, and really de|&s;erv'd
it, for he was &s;o; and no Doubt,
there are many more &s;uch; and therefore the
Reproach, that a Trade&s;man cannot be an
hone&s;t Man is a Slander, and no other; and
there I &s;hall leave it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the needful Capacities of a compleat
Trade&s;man; that he need not be a Scholar,
yet &s;hould not be a Dunce; that he need
not be a Wit, yet &s;hould not be a Fool;
that a competent Degree of Knowledge is
nece&s;&s;ary to his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and although
that too much may rather make him too
enterprizing, or too indolent, yet the Di|rection
of Bu&s;ine&s;s requires, that a
Trade&s;man &s;hould be a Man of good Sen&s;e,
a Man of Under&s;tanding and Judg|ment.</HEAD>
<P>_TIS an odd Saying, as well as &s;aid in
an odd (antient) Style, that a <HI>Trade&s;|man</HI>
&s;hould have <HI>Mother-Wit,</HI> but
no <HI>Clergy:</HI> I differ exceedingly
from my Forefathers in that Point; a Fool
may make a Fiddler, but he will make an
ill Shop-Keeper; the Trade&s;man mu&s;t be a
Man of Sen&s;e, or he will never be a Man of
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>BY a Fool here I would be under&s;tood
as <HI>I mean,</HI> not as <HI>I &s;peak;</HI> that is to &s;ay,
not in the Letter; I don't mean an Idiot, a
<PB N="54" REF="66">
Driveler, a meer natural Fool; but an un|taught,
illiterate, &s;hallow-headed Fellow,
who we ordinarily call a Fool; and even
&s;uch the Trade&s;men &s;hould not be, if it be
po&s;&s;ible to help or avoid it.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Trade&s;man, I &s;ay, &s;hould be
a Man of Sen&s;e; what if it is not ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould be what we call a Man
of Parts? He &s;hould, nay, he mu&s;t, have
Knowledge competent to his Bu&s;ine&s;s. As to
Learning, it is not ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he
&s;hould under&s;tand <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin;</HI> but
'tis ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould under&s;tand
Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s: Tho' he need not be
a Man of Letters, he ought to be a Man
of Figures; as a Carpenter need not under|&s;tand
Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s A&s;tronomical Tables,
yet he ought to be Ma&s;ter of <HI>Gunter's Scale,</HI>
and know how to mea&s;ure by his Rule and
his Compa&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE are many Studies as remote from
a Trade&s;man as the <HI>Greek Grammar</HI> is from
the <HI>Engli&s;h Primmer;</HI> but it does not fol|low,
therefore, that the Trade&s;man mu&s;t
know nothing but his Weights and Mea|&s;ures:
As I &s;ay in my Title, he need not
be a <HI>Wit,</HI> but he &s;hould not be a <HI>Dunce:</HI>
He need not be a Poet or a Pedant; but he
&s;hould not be a dull &s;leepy Thing, that has
no Genius to any Thing, but ju&s;t what he
has before him; he &s;hould have &s;ome Spirit
and Life in his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="67">
THERE are <HI>thin-headed</HI> Fellows, who
are all Flutter and Fancy, that are too vo|latile
for a Shop or Warehou&s;e, and a&s;e fit|ter
for Dancing Ma&s;ters than Trade&s;men;
and there are <HI>thick-headed</HI> Fellows on the
other hand, who mu&s;t have every Thing
beaten into them, as Men cleave Blocks, with
Beetle and Wedges.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Trade&s;man is the Middle
among the&s;e Extremes; he knows more
than he has an immediate U&s;e for, and is
capable of learning more than he knows;
he loves Knowledge enough to make him
&s;eek it, and knows he wants it enough to
make him love it; he has Knowledge enough
to make him diligent, and not &s;o much as
to make him loo&s;e and a&s;piring.</P>
<P>ONE of the be&s;t Parts of Knowledge the
Trade&s;man in good Bu&s;ine&s;s can have, is to
know <HI>when he is well;</HI> be contented to go
on where he is, keep the Road, not &s;trag|gling
into unknown By-paths of Trade,
which he has never travelled in before, and
where he does not know the Way in, or the
Way out, but may be lo&s;t before he can
look round him. Over much &s;earching after
more Bu&s;ine&s;s, when he has enough already,
gra&s;ping when he has his Hands full, and
hatching more, when he is as full as he can
hold, is a trading Evil, and generally is fa|tal
to the Trade&s;men; 'tis like a Sow bring|ing
forth more Pigs than &s;he can &s;uckle, or
<PB N="56" REF="68">
a Hen laying more Eggs than &s;he can
cover.</P>
<P>THE ploding fair-driving Trade&s;man, that
goes on &s;afe and &s;ure, and is always mo|ving;
he, I &s;ay, is the Man that bids faire&s;t
to be rich: The Coach and the Chariot gal|lop,
and drive, and the Po&s;ts whip and &s;pur;
but the Plowman and the Carrier go &s;oft
and fair, and yet the la&s;t come with the
greate&s;t Certainty to the End of their Jour|ney,
and draw or carry the greate&s;t Burden.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Carriage, which we u&s;e in
drawing the greate&s;t Burdens or Loads, I
mean &s;uch as draw Timber, and are, in our
modern U&s;age, call'd a Wain or Carriage,
are in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> called a <HI>Tug,</HI> from
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Language, &s;ignifying Hard
Labour; and the <HI>Waggon</HI> has its Deriva|tion
from the &s;ame Language, wherein the
Words are u&s;ually expre&s;&s;ive of the Manner
or Thing which they are u&s;ed for; as the
<HI>Waggon</HI> is a Carriage, which being heavy
loaden, does but ju&s;t WAG ON; but &s;till
'tis ob&s;erv'd, it keeps wagging, and it al|ways
goes on; and as &s;oftly as it goes, we
&s;ee &s;ome of our Carriers come as far as from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> a hundred and fifty Miles to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
with forty to fifty Hundred Weight, and
make their Journeys con&s;tantly, wet or dry,
dark or light, blow high, blow low, &s;till,
according to their true original Name, and
the Meaning of it, they WAG ON.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69">
THUS the prudent Trade&s;man, that goes
on carefully and gently, lets no Irons burn,
and yet lets no Irons cool; he truly drives
his Trade, but does not pu&s;h it; keeps it
going, but does not over-run it; keeps
in his own Orbit, and within the Circle of
his own diurnal Revolution: This is in a Word
the Compleat Trade&s;man.</P>
<P>Now, as I &s;aid, this Trade&s;man &s;hould
neither be a Wit or a Fool: My Rea&s;on is
this; I do not think a Man can have too
much Wit, let his Calling or Employment
be what it will, provided there is a due
Weight of Judgment and Experience to
ballance this Wit; for there is a manife&s;t
Difference between Wit and Judgment, not
in the Nature of them only, but in their
Operation al&s;o; and indeed, they will nei|ther
of them be able to &s;hew their Value
alone. Like <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Wool in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ma|nufacture,
they are too fine to work by
them&s;elves; and, as Silver, is too brittle to
work without its Aloy: There mu&s;t be a
Mixture of Judgment to keep the Wit &s;olid.</P>
<Q><L>Wit, without Sen&s;e, is like the laughing Evil,</L>
<L>While Sen&s;e unmix'd with Fancy, is the Devil.</L></Q>
<P>WIT, like Mercury and Quick&s;ilver, is
of U&s;e to make the Silver Ore run, and &s;e|parate
the Sterling from the Dro&s;s; but
bring it to the Crucible by it&s;elf, it flies up
<PB N="58" REF="70">
into the Air, like a true Spirit, and is lo&s;t
at once, and who can fix it again after|wards.</P>
<P>A Wit, turn'd Trade&s;man! what an in|congruous
Part of Nature is there brought
together, con&s;i&s;ting of direct Contraries?
No Apron Strings will hold him; 'tis in
vain to lock him in behind the Compter,
he's gone in a Moment; in&s;tead of Journal
and Ledger, he runs away to his <HI>Virgil</HI>
and <HI>Horace;</HI> his Journal Entries are all
Pindaricks, and his Ledger is all Heroicks;
he is truly dramatick from one End to the
other, through the whole Scene of his
Trade; and as the fir&s;t Part is all Comedy,
&s;o the two la&s;t Acts are always made up with
Tragedy; a Statute of Bankrupt is his <HI>Exeunt
omnes,</HI> and he generally &s;peaks the Epilogue
in the <HI>Fleet Pri&s;on</HI> or the <HI>Mint.</HI> Again,
take the Fool-Trade&s;man, the thick-headed
Wretch, that has nothing bright about him;
no Genius neither for one or other; he
&s;hould have been the Manufacturer, not
the Factor; he &s;hould have &s;tood by the
Shuttle and the Warping-Mill, not come to
the Buying and Selling; indeed he is a
kind of a natural Mechanick, <HI>viz.</HI> Nature
cut him out to be a meer Mechanick, not a
Trade&s;man; to make the Work, not buy
and &s;ell it; and he is out of his Element
when he is out of the Loom.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="71">
INDEED, when you &s;ee him in the Shop
or the Warehou&s;e, he &s;eems to be a little like
the Shuttle that the Weaver throws backward
and &s;orward, he is ever going ju&s;t the &s;ame
Pace, and keeps the &s;ame &s;oad: This backward
and forward is the only Motion, for ought
I know, in all Natures Engines, that is not
circular; 'tis the Pendulum of the Manu|facture,
which regulates and mea&s;ures the
re&s;t of its Motions, and makes all the circu|lar
Motions be exact.</P>
<P>THIS Man is no more fit for a Trade&s;man
than the fluttering Shuttlecock-Trade&s;man
mentioned above as a Wit: If the Trade&s;man
is a Man of Wit, a Man of bright Thoughts,
has a Touring Fancy, a Profu&s;ion of polite Ideas,
let him make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s to keep all tho&s;e
fine Parts of Nature's Imagery within Bounds;
let him make u&s;e of them like fine Paint|ings,
to be hanged up in his Hall, and grace
the Entrance; let him garni&s;h his Soul with
them as much as he plea&s;es, and &s;hew them
as much as he finds Occa&s;ion, but not take
them down, and di&s;place them.</P>
<P>THE fine&s;t Accompli&s;hments of Nature
may do the Trade&s;man no Harm, if he can
keep this Magazine of Gunpowder from the
Fire; but if he brings the Candle to it, or
brings the Powder to the Candle, he is gone,
he is &s;ure to be blown up: Pictures taken
down from the Wall, and &s;et one before
another, with their painted Sides inward,
<PB N="60" REF="72">
are the wor&s;t Furniture in the Hou&s;e, and
like a fine brocaded Silk, are beautiful on one
Side, but all Rags and Ends on the other.</P>
<P>THE Brightne&s;s of the Trade&s;man's Head,
the Clearne&s;s of his Thought, the Eleva|tion
of his Fancy, they are all <HI>out-of-the|way
Things</HI> to the poor Man in his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and &s;erve only to &s;et him up in a Station
above him&s;elf; make him fancy him&s;elf fra|med
by Nature for other Things than the
Compter or the Compting-Hou&s;e; and &s;o
&s;et his Pride a tip-toe, bloating it up into
Conceit; and thus the Man is undone.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t and wor&s;t Mi&s;chief that can at|tend
a Trade&s;man is Conceit of his own
Worth: Such a Man fancies the World is
ill-&s;orted with him, that he is under-rated
among Mankind; that Nature de&s;ign'd him
for &s;omething above what he is, and his
Father made a wrong Judgment of him
when he put him to a Trade: He &s;hould
have been &s;ent to the Univer&s;ity when he
was put Apprentice, and &s;hould have had a
Company in the Guards when he &s;et up Shop|keeping;
that then he had been &s;omething
in the World like him&s;elf, and been fit
Company for Gentlemen, and the like; or
&s;hould have been put to the Law, and made
a Coun&s;ellor.</P>
<P>LET the Trade&s;man once have but his Head
full of the&s;e Things, and he is a lo&s;t Man:
From that Hour he takes out a Commi&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="61" REF="73">
Bankrupt again&s;t him&s;elf by the very Notion
of it; he can do nothing ever after, but read
News, go abroad to &s;ee Shows, Ma&s;que|rades,
and Opera's: If War is upon the Anvil,
he wi&s;hes him&s;elf in the Field, and thinks
him&s;elf qualified to be every Thing that he
&s;ees other Men arrive at.</P>
<P>D&mdash;it, &s;aid a good &s;ub&s;tantial Chim|ney-Sweeper,
that I knew, if my Father had
had the lea&s;t Under&s;tanding, how to &s;uit the
Employments he put his Children to, with
the Genius and Inclinations of his Sons, he
would have made my Brother <HI>Tom</HI> a Chim|ney-Sweeper,
not me: I &s;hould have been
bred to the Sea, or &s;ent into the Army: I,
that knew how to de&s;erve, and had Sen&s;e and
Parts to recommend my&s;elf, I &s;hould have
been an Admiral by this Time, or a General
Officer, and &s;hewn my Under&s;tanding in a
Council of War: I &s;hould have let the World
know that I had good Blood in my Veins,
and that my Ance&s;tors, tho' buried in Obli|vion
by the Injuries of Time, were cer|tainly
&s;omething con&s;iderable; and that their
Virtue and Gallantry &s;hould revive in their
Po&s;terity, though their Families could not
be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Heralds. Upon
this the puff'd-up Mortal laid by his black
Cloaths and his Truncheon, went into the
Army, got maim'd with a Shot in his Hand,
and the next News I had of him was, that
I &s;aw him a begging.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="74">
AMBITION and a&s;piring Thought are
Plagues and Di&s;ea&s;es to a Trade&s;man: When
they work in his Mind, his Friends &s;hould
get his Head &s;hav'd, and put him into a
dark Hou&s;e for a little while, admini&s;tring
proper Phy&s;ick to him, to keep him from the
Vapours; and that the Cure might be wrought
upon his Under&s;tanding, it &s;hould be fir&s;t
wrought upon his Body, for the de&s;ir'd Ef|fect.</P>
<P>THE
Trade&s;man &s;hould be wi&s;e rather
than witty; he &s;hould be as wi&s;e as he can
in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and though he pa&s;&s;es for <HI>no
Body</HI> among the Beaus, and Wits of the
Town, Nature's Weather-Cocks, and the
Froth and Flutter of the Creation, he will
be <HI>&s;ome Body</HI> in his own Way, and build
upon a Foundation, that his Po&s;terity may
have Room to value them&s;elves upon;
and if he cannot be a Gentleman, he may
be able to buy a Gentleman, and that's
enough to him.</P>
<P>BUSINESS is a Thing &s;uited to a ftaid
Head; it does not require the polite Part
of human Under&s;tanding, or call for a li|beral
Education; and it is the Trade&s;man's
Mercy that it is &s;o: But at the &s;ame Time
he knows little of Bu&s;ine&s;s, who thinks a
Trade&s;man may be a Fool, an Idiot, or a
Natural.</P>
<P>IT is a poor Pittance of human Nature,
that the&s;e Men will allow to a Trade&s;man,
<PB N="63" REF="75">
that they will allow him neither Sen&s;e or
Hone&s;ty; that he need not be a wi&s;e Man,
and is bound to be a K&mdash;; that he needs
no Wit, and can have no Honour: But &s;uch
Men forget that the Hone&s;ty and the Wit
are A&s;&s;i&s;tants to one another, and that the
Trade&s;man that is a K&mdash;, is generally &s;o

rich becau&s;e he is diligent.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;omejudicious People &s;ay from
their Judgment of Nature, and I join exactly
with their Opinion, that a Fool and a Coward

he does not under&s;tand it; he does

goes beyond the Limits of it, and when
not; what is litterally hone&s;t, and what
is con&s;tructively &s;o; what Hone&s;ty im|plies,
and what it contains; in a Word,
he does not know where Hone&s;ty ends,
and Knavery begins, or where the Ex|tremes
of them join. How &s;ould a
<PB N="64" REF="76">
Man be hone&s;t, &s;trictly hone&s;t, that does
not know when he is &s;o? and when he
is not, when he does right and when he
does wrong? One Way he is hone&s;t to
his own Lo&s;s and Di&s;advantage, for
fear of being a Knave; another Way
he is a Knave, by the meer Folly and
Weakne&s;s of his Head, and when he does
not de&s;ign it? and all becau&s;e he does not
know it, and con&s;equently does not
know how to &s;hun and avoid it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Coward cannot be hone&s;t, becau&s;e
when Difficulties and Hazards, Quarrels
and Dangers happen, and his Way
&s;eems to be hedg'd up with Thorns,
the Man &s;inks with the Terror of
it, and has not Courage to be hone&s;t;
he cannot <HI>Dare,</HI> he cannot hold up
his Head again&s;t Danger, or his Heart
again&s;t Power; he may be threatened
and frighted into an ill Thing, though
it is not willingly; and though he is not
a Knave in Choice, he will be &s;o for
fear; he cannot be otherwi&s;e.</ITEM>

<P>THERE is a great Deal more of this kind
to be &s;aid for it, under both tho&s;e Heads;

an hone&s;t Man: The Trade&s;man that wants
a Head, wants the E&s;&s;ential of his Charac|ter,
he is neither fit to be a Chriftian, or to
be a Trade&s;man; a Fool is not qualified for
this World, or for another; he is a K&mdash;becau&s;e
he is a Fool, and knows not how to
be hone&s;t; and he is &s;till the more a Fool,
becau&s;e he &s;toops to be a K&mdash;; in a word,
he is an unhappy Creature, and unhappily
embarra&s;&s;ed in the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of being
both wicked and &s;imple together.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man therefore mu&s;t not be a
Fool; it entangles him in the mo&s;t mi&s;erable
Circum&s;tances of Life, and brings him into
the Nece&s;&s;ity of acting in a Manner that does
not con&s;i&s;t with that Reputation, &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial
to a Trade&s;man; a &s;olid Quantity of
good Sen&s;e, no Pride, (no Flutter, no Fop,)
Sen&s;e and Wit con&s;olidated, mix'd in due
Proportions, and &s;uited to the main End of
Life: The&s;e are the Qualifications needful to
a Compleat Trade&s;man.</P>
<P>THERE are a certain &s;ort of People, often
found among Trade&s;men, that are in the
middle State between the&s;e two above|named;
I mean K&mdash;and F&mdash;, and
who yet we take to be properly of neither of
the two Species; and the&s;e we call <HI>Cunning
Men;</HI> a kind of &s;hrewd de&s;igning Men, that
are always &s;tudying to be what they call
<PB N="66" REF="78">
&s;harp; that never think they do any Thing,
if they do not act beyond every Body, and
if they do not circumvent every Body they
deal with.</P>
<P>THESE Cunning Men will find it a very
hard Matter &s;upport the Credit of their Ho|ni&s;ty,
or to make a good Claim to the Title
of it. Hone&s;ty and Cunning are a different
Species. I have heard of a kind of North|Country
Double-faced Hone&s;ty, which is
little better than meer Craft; but it will ne|ver
&s;tand the Te&s;t, it will never pa&s;s for
Hone&s;ty among Men of &s;imple well-mean|ing
Principles.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man &s;hould be wi&s;e as the Ser|pent,
but he &s;hould be innocent, that is,
<HI>Hone&s;t</HI> too as the Dove; he &s;hould have the
Wi&s;dom of the Serpent, but not the Cun|ning,
the Craft, the Sharping, the Biting of
the Serpent; he &s;hould be wi&s;e and hone&s;t,
and if he is truly wi&s;e, he mu&s;t be hone&s;t;
Wi&s;dom is a Part of his Hone&s;ty, as it is e&s;|&s;ential
to it.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Trade&s;man mu&s;t be a wi&s;e
Man; and yet, as I &s;aid, he need not be a
Wit: He &s;hould be a Man wi&s;e in his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
wi&s;e in his Way, and that Wi&s;dom is
enough to him: He &s;hould be wi&s;e as a
Trade&s;man. And I think it would not be ami&s;s
to explain my &s;elf a little upon that Subject,
for the Wi&s;dom of a Trade&s;man has many
effential Things in it, which yet do not qua|lify
<PB N="67" REF="79">
him for the Wi&s;dom of any other Species,
or to pa&s;s for a Wit in the World.</P>
<Q>1. He mu&s;t be wi&s;e and wary; wi&s;e enough
not to be cheated and impos'd upon,
ruin'd, and undone by others: This is a
Wi&s;dom, which however it maybe &s;aid to
be of a meaner Kind, and that the Brutes
are acknowledged to be very much
Ma&s;ters of it; yet it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to be found in a Man embark'd
in Bu&s;ine&s;s: The World is full of
Craft and Subtilty, Sharping and Bi|ting;
and if the Trade&s;man be hone&s;t,
and not wary; if he is what we call a
weak Man, he is in the utmo&s;t Danger
of being undone. 'Tis very hard,
yet &s;o it is, that the Hone&s;ty in that
Ca&s;e is a Di&s;a&s;ter to him, that is to
&s;ay, the want of being &s;harp in his
Bu&s;ine&s;s makes his Principle of Ho|ne&s;ty
dangerous to him; he is not able
to prevent Frauds upon him&s;elf, for
want of Sagacity, and a due Share of
Under&s;tanding, and he cannot return
Sharping for Sharping; and &s;o his Ho|ne&s;ty
not being fortified by his Wit, and
the Heart not a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Head, he
falls a Prey to the fir&s;t cunning &s;harping
Knave, that he happens to be dealing
with.</Q>
<P><PB N="68" REF="80">
THERE is a memorable Story well known
in the Place where it was tran&s;acted, which
is &s;o directly to this Purpo&s;e, that tho' it re|lates
to an Affair in foreign Commerce, yet
I cannot think it out of Cour&s;e in this
Place.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchant in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> having
a large Parcel of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloths to &s;ell, an
<HI>Armeian</HI> Merchant comes to &s;ee them: He
brings with him a <HI>Jew,</HI> who was a Broker
between them, and which is u&s;ual in the&s;e
Countries, to make the Bargain, and to fix the
Price; all which, to &s;horten the Story, was
done to his Mind. But the main Que&s;tion
was about Payment.</P>
<P>THE Merchant enquired of the <HI>Jew</HI> about
the Character of his <HI>Armenian</HI> Cu&s;tomer;
and he, pretending to be very impartial, an|&s;wer'd
coldly, That he could &s;ay nothing to
that, only that he believed him to be very
hone&s;t, and al&s;o able; that he had a great
Parcel of Goods, &s;uch as Bales of Silk,
and Sacks of Gaul to &s;ell; and that he &s;up|po&s;ed
he might either have them in Ex|change
for his Cloths; but added, that he
could &s;ay little.</P>
<P>THE Merchant was not &s;atisfied with that
Account, becau&s;e the <HI>Armenian</HI> in&s;i&s;ted up|on
twenty Days Time for the di&s;po&s;ing his
Goods, and that then he would pay in Mo|ney;
and did not offer his own Goods in imme|diate
Exchange; &s;o they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="81">
A few Days after, the <HI>Armenian</HI> finds
Means, by the Help of the &s;ame <HI>Jew,</HI> to
get ten Bales, that is to &s;ay, a hundred Cloths
into his Warehou&s;e, belonging either to the
<HI>Jew</HI> him&s;elf, or &s;ome other Per&s;on, for
which it &s;eems the <HI>Armenian</HI> had either made
Payment, or given Pledge for the returning
them.</P>
<P>AFTER this the knavi&s;h <HI>Jew</HI> takes an
Occa&s;ion to bring the Merchant to the
<HI>Armenian</HI>'s Chamber or Room in the <HI>Cara|van&s;era,</HI>
or Inn, and there he &s;ees ten Bales
of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth: Upon this he concludes
the <HI>Jew</HI> had trick'd him, and had &s;poken in|differently
of the <HI>Armenian,</HI> on Purpo&s;e to
&s;ell another Merchant Goods, and hinder
him; and asking the <HI>Jew</HI> the Meaning of
it, he told him, they were &s;uch a Merchant's
Bales, naming &s;ome Merchant that was
gone away from the Place at that Time, for
about three Weeks; &s;o that he could not en|quire
of him, and that he had tru&s;ted the
<HI>Armenian</HI> very readily with tho&s;e hundred
Cloths, knowing him to be a very hone&s;t
Man,</P>
<P>UPON this the Merchant &s;olicites the <HI>Ar|menian</HI>
again to buy, who appeared back|ward,
play'd off, and &s;aid he was now &s;up|plied,
and had almo&s;t enough; but at la&s;t
&s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be prevail'd with by the
<HI>Jew,</HI> who was a Confederate, to take the
Goods; and the hone&s;t weak Merchant per|fectly
<PB N="70" REF="82">
deluded, concludes the Bargain, being
10th to lo&s;e the Opportunity of &s;elling the
Goods.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Goods are delivered to
the Value of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> or upwards, in three Days
more, being but two Days before Payment
was to be made, the <HI>Armenian</HI> di&s;appeared,
and the <HI>Jew</HI> al&s;o; and the poor deceived
Merchant was ruined and undone.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man, tho' he need neither be
Poet or Politician, &s;hould yet have &s;o much
Wit, or whatever you plea&s;e to call it, not to
be cheated thus; &s;o much Capacity as to bear
up again&s;t Fraud, and deal with a <HI>Jew:</HI>
And this is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his own
Safety; for without this the Trade&s;man is
never &s;ecure; and he that is not &s;ufficiently
&s;tored in the Head, to defend him&s;elf again&s;t
&s;uch Things as the&s;e, is not qualified to be a
Trade&s;man; &s;uch a Man &s;hould be put Ap|prentice
to &s;ome Handicraft, or &s;hould be
&s;ent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> rather than to be plac'd
in a Compting-Hou&s;e, or behind the Comp|ter.</P>
<P>THEY are therefore much deceived, that
think Men of the meane&s;t Capacities only are
qualified to be Trade&s;men: Though the
Trade&s;man, as I have &s;aid, need not be a
polite fini&s;h'd Genius, tho' he need not be
a Poet, a Scholar, a State&s;man, yet he &s;hould
be a Man of Sen&s;e; one that under&s;tands his
Bu&s;ine&s;s in general, that knows &s;omething
<PB N="71" REF="83">
of the World, and how to deal with Man|kind;
not a Novice, that may be made a
Tool of, and be cheated by every Shar|per.</P>
<P>I have hinted in the former Volume, that
it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary a Trade&s;man &s;hould
under&s;tand the Goods he deals in; and it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, indeed; but I mu&s;t add,
there is a general Under&s;tanding al&s;o needful
to the Trade&s;man, which goes beyond the par|ticular
Part; that is, he &s;hould be a Man of
Under&s;tanding as a Trade&s;man; it is in ge|neral
expre&s;&s;ed by that common but &s;ignifi|cant
Term, a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, a Man ac|quainted
with Bu&s;ine&s;s in general, that knows
the ordinary Rules of Dealings in the World,
and how an hone&s;t Man &s;hould act in all
Ca&s;es; one that, tho' he is in him&s;elf an hone&s;t
Man, will not be at a Lo&s;s how to deal with
Knaves, <HI>Jews,</HI> and Sharpers; that is to &s;ay,
not how to deal with them in their own Way,
but how to fence again&s;t them, and how to
prevent his being circumvented by them.</P>
<Q><P>2. Be&s;ides this Warine&s;s, the Trade&s;man
ought to be a Man of univer&s;al Know|ledge
in Dealing; he ought to under|&s;tand
&s;omething of all the general
Schemes of Commerce, e&s;pecially of
his own Country; I &s;ay, <HI>his own Coun|try
now,</HI> becau&s;e I am confined in this
Di&s;cour&s;e to the Inland Home-Trade
<PB N="72" REF="84">
of <HI>England,</HI> and am &s;peaking of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;man in particular; for
as to foreign Trade, it is not concern'd
in this Article at all.</P>
<P>As I am &s;peaking thus of the Home|Trade,
and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;man only:
It is not enough, that the Trade&s;man
&s;hould under&s;tand ju&s;t what he more
immediately deals in; he meets with
frequent Offers and Occa&s;ions to Trade,
to Day in one Thing, to Morrow in an|other;
to Day on his own Account, to
Morrow by Commi&s;&s;ion; to Day &s;ingly,
to Morrow in Partner&s;hip; and it is
requi&s;ite he &s;hould be a Man of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
that, as is u&s;ually &s;aid, nothing may
come ami&s;s to him, nothing may be &s;o
out of his Way, as that he may not un|der&s;tand
it.</P></Q>
<P>IF he is not a Man of State and Poli|ticks,
he &s;hould be a Man of full Employ;
a Trade&s;man is never idle: <HI>Bu&s;ine&s;s</HI> is in
its right Sen&s;e a comprehen&s;ive Word, and
requires a comprehen&s;ive Under&s;tanding
too in its kind; and though I have not
room fully to explain it, yet the Reader will
under&s;tand what I mean by what I have all
along in&s;i&s;ted on in the Direction to Trade&s;
men, namely, to apply them&s;elves with all
their Might, and exert their utmo&s;t Dili|gence
in the carrying on their Trade; to
<PB N="73" REF="85">
get Judgment in the Goods they deal in;
to gain a general Knowledge in all Bu&s;ine&s;s;
to be able to undertake any Trade, though
not bred to it; to under&s;tand how to corre&s;|pond;
to write a Trading Style; to keep
their Books well; and the like, in whatever
Bu&s;ine&s;s they undertake.</P>
<P>THESE Things help to con&s;titute a Man
of Bu&s;ine&s;s; in a word, he that is thus
qualified is fit for any Thing, will get his
Bread in any Country, is agreeable to all
Society, and in all Places can turn his Hand
and his Head to any Trade, to any Employ|ment,
as Occa&s;ion calls him out.</P>
<P>I need &s;ay no more then, to his Ca|pacities:
You will ea&s;ily grant, that
&s;uch a Man as this mu&s;t not be a Fool,
not an empty &s;hallow-headed, rattling,
nothing-doing Fellow; the Man of Bu|&s;ine&s;s
is a Man of Weight, a Man of
Value and of Worth, and cannot be an ig|norant,
dull, unmeaning Head; it is evi|dent
in Experience, we &s;ee it every where,
the Trade&s;man that is a thriving, managing,
diligent Man, is full of Vigour, full of Vi|vacity,
always &s;tirring and bu&s;tling, never
idle, never &s;otti&s;h; his Head and his Heart
are employ'd; he moves with a kind of
Velocity, unknown to other Men: The Plow|man
goes on heavy, and with Labour, tho'
&s;teadily and &s;uitably to his Bu&s;ine&s;s too:
The Carrier <HI>wags on,</HI> according to the true
<PB N="74" REF="86">
Import of the Machine he drives, which
was therefore call'd a Waggon, from the
Slowne&s;s of its Motion; but the Trade&s;man,
all Life and Spirit, like a Planet, is conti|nually
in a brisk Motion; and whether di|rect
or retrogade, he always has his double
Revolution round his own Axis, and at the
&s;ame Time progre&s;&s;ive too: He has his an|nual
and his diurnal Motion; by the la&s;t
he influences his Shop, and immediate Cor|re&s;pondence;
and by the fir&s;t his Encrea&s;e
in Stock, and the general Gain of his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
which he ca&s;ts up annually for his
compleat Satisfaction.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Trade&s;man then mu&s;t be
a Man of general Knowledge, as well as
of a particular Under&s;tanding; he mu&s;t not
only under&s;tand his Shop, his Books, and
how to &s;ell his Goods, but he mu&s;t have a
general Knowledge of all Trade; he mu&s;t
know the true Original of all the Goods he
deals in, the Growth and Fountain of every
Product, and the &s;everal Variations of Spe|cies;
the Changes that every Manfacture &s;uf|fers
by Dying, Managing, and all the O|perations
by which the Face of it is alter'd;
how it comes to be what it is; whence every
Thing comes, and whether it goes, and (as I
may call it) the Beginning and End of every
Article in Trade.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man may be too learned, as I
have &s;aid, in other Things; but he can ne|ver
<PB N="75" REF="87">
know too much in Trade; he may &s;peak
too much <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> but can never
&s;peak too much Trading <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> he may
be too much a Man of Letters, but he can
never be too much a Man of Figures.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Trade&s;man is made com|pleat
by this very Thing; 'tis by the gene|ral
Knowledge of Bu&s;ine&s;s that he becomes
a Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that he is fitted for un|dertaking
whatever offers to his Advantage,
and knows how to judge what is fit for him
to undertake.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to one of the main
Parts of a Trade&s;man's Wi&s;dom, that Ex|cellence
of Knowledge and Under&s;tanding
by which he knows not only what may be
for his Advantage, and what Undertaking to
venture upon, and how to enter upon it;
but by which he is qualified to give that
mo&s;t u&s;eful Thing called a <HI>Negative</HI> in any
Propo&s;al of Bu&s;ine&s;s that is before him.</P>
<P>IT is but too often that a Trade&s;man is
drawn in by the &s;pecious Pretences of Gain,
and of apparent Succe&s;s, to embark in Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
perhaps out of his Way, and remote
from his ordinary Employment; and &s;ome|times
by the Nature of the Thing it&s;elf, or
by the meer Dint of his own Application
and exqui&s;ite Management, he may be &s;aid
even to force it to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>BUT the nice&s;t Part of his Skill is, to &s;earch
the Thing to the Bottom at fir&s;t, and &s;ee all
<PB N="76" REF="88">
the Arcana, the Creeks and Corners of the
Affair beforehand, and judge whether it will
do, or no, before he engages; then accord|ing
to that Judgment to refu&s;e, as well as to
accept; and &s;o, as above, to give a Nega|tive,
if he &s;ees it rea&s;onable; not embark
fir&s;t, and then find by the Lo&s;s that
the Thing would not do, and &s;o be ob|liged
at la&s;t to throw it up with burnt Fin|gers.</P>
<P>THE
refu&s;ing &s;pecious Projects and fair|looking
Propo&s;als of Profit, calls for the ut|mo&s;t
Perfection of Judgment in a Trade&s;|man;
for the meer natural Propen&s;ity which
there is in a Trade&s;man, by the very Con|&s;equence
of his Profe&s;&s;ion, to hearken to
every Thing that is probable to bring an
Advantage, has a violent Bia&s;s in his
Thoughts, in favour of a new Propo&s;al; but
this Fire is often to his Lo&s;s, and he ought
to have a needful Degree of Phlegm to
balance it, to bring him to examine every
Side of the Propo&s;al, &s;ee the good and the
bad together, &s;etting the Probabilities on either
Side in a true Light, and judging with the
utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s and Indifferency between
the one and the other, &s;o to bring him&s;elf to
a Power of &s;aying No, which I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s
it is very difficult to a Trade&s;man to
do.</P>
<P>IN all Propo&s;als, &s;uch as I am now &s;peak|ing
of, the Profits are generally placed in
<PB N="77" REF="89">
the Front of the Undertaking, and the
Trade&s;man is &s;hewn the &s;mooth Side of
Things fir&s;t; the Difficulties, the Hazards,
the Po&s;&s;ibilities, and Events, the Probabilities
of Di&s;a&s;ter and Mi&s;carriage ordinarily lie
hid, and out of Sight; and this is the Rea|&s;on
why &s;o many Trade&s;men are drawn into
Di&s;a&s;ter and Misfortune before they are
aware, and dip into Bu&s;ine&s;s too deep be|fore
they &s;ee their Way out, before they
find their Mi&s;take, and why &s;o many do not
&s;ee it till it is too late to retrieve it, and &s;o
never get out at all.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man's Prudence, if he be a Man
of Judgment, is how to put every Thing to its
Tryal; HERE if at any Time Wit &s;tands him
in&s;tead, when it furni&s;hes him with a Penetra|tion
&s;ufficient to judge for him&s;elf, that he
may neither refu&s;e an Advantage, which it
is again&s;t the Grain very much for a Trade&s;|man
to do, or fall into a Snare.</P>
<P>NOR is this meerly when an Offer is
made by Sharpers and Projectors, to cheat
and deceive him, and with a De&s;ign to tra|pan
him; for there &s;ometimes an ordinary
Judgment may find Things out, and a
Knave may be detected in the very fir&s;t
Appearance; but it is mo&s;t dangerous when
it is brought to him in the Hand of good|meaning
hone&s;t Men, who may be mi&s;ta|ken
in their Judgment, or may be blinded
by the &s;pecious Probabilities, and the Out|&s;ide
<PB N="78" REF="90">
of Things, and may offer and propo&s;e
without De&s;ign to delude or deceive the Per|&s;on
they make the Propo&s;al to.</P>
<P>THESE are indeed of the two the mo&s;t
dangerous; for in &s;uch a Ca&s;e the Man
propo&s;ing is deceived him&s;elf, through his
Ignorance, and deceives or offers to deceive
the Trade&s;man innocently, and without any
De&s;ign of Evil; believing that the Propo|&s;al
is really every Way as advantageous as
he (the Propo&s;er) &s;ets it out to be, of|fering
to embark with him in an equal
Ri&s;que, and on an equal Foot with him&s;elf;
in which Ca&s;e, if it fail, the Con&s;equence
is, that they are both deceived together, and
perhaps both ruin'd together; and yet the
Man that drew him in may be no Deceiver
neither, as is often the Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Now here the Perfection of the Trade&s;|man's
Judgment &s;hews it&s;elf; here is need
of his utmo&s;t Skill and Penetration, to &s;ee into
the deficient Parts of a fair and promi&s;ing
Out&s;ide, to weigh with an unbia&s;s'd and im|partial
Judgment every Thing, not that
appears only, but all the Events, all the
Di&s;appointments, and all the cro&s;s Incidents
that may happen to thwart the Expectations
of the Propo&s;er, and render the De&s;ign
abortive, and, according to the&s;e Di&s;coveries,
to clo&s;e with, or to decline the Adventure.</P>
<P>BY this Pre&s;cience of his Under&s;tanding
and Judgment he concludes thus: It is po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="79" REF="91">
indeed, &s;uch an Undertaking may an|&s;wer,
nay, 'tis very probable too, and there
are &s;uch and &s;uch good Pro&s;pects in it, and
I believe the Man means no Fraud, but is
perfectly hone&s;t in the De&s;ign of it; but
I &s;ee there are Difficulties in it too, and here
it may fall &s;hort, there it may mi&s;carry;
here I may be di&s;appointed, and there I
may be di&s;appointed; and upon the Whole,
I doubt it will do me no good, and there|fore
I will not meddle with it, I wont ven|ture;
I'll let it alone; better &s;it &s;till, than
ri&s;e up and fall.</P>
<P>THIS Caution is the &s;afe Side of a Trade&s;|man's
Management; and we &s;eldom &s;ee &s;uch
a Man mi&s;carry; 'tis the only Perfection of
his Judgment to be able to give a Nega|tive,
and to give him&s;elf a Rea&s;on for it;
for the Difficulty of refu&s;ing, lies in the
Trade&s;man him&s;elf; the powerful Inclina|tion
to get Money is in a Trade&s;man like the
Attraction in the Centre of the Solar Sy&s;tem;
it draws all the Bodies within its Compa&s;s to,
or towards it&s;elf; it influences all their Mo|tions,
and directs them to their proper End.</P>
<P>GAIN is the Trade&s;man's Life, 'tis the
E&s;&s;ence of his Being, as a qualified Trade&s;|man.
Convenience, and the Supply of ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Things for Life, were the fir&s;t Cau&s;es
indeed of Trade; but the Rea&s;on and End
of the Trade&s;man is to get Money: 'Tis the
Pole-Star and Guide, the Aim and De&s;ign
<PB N="80" REF="92">
of all his Motions; 'tis the Center and
Point to which all his Actions tend; 'tis
the Soul of Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Spur of Indu&s;try,
the Wheel that turns within all the Wheels
of his whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, and gives Motion to
all the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Now, 'tis hard to turn the Trade&s;man
from any Undertaking which has a probable
View of Gain in it: The Propo&s;al comes
with great Advantage to him, when the very
Pro&s;pect &s;hines in his Eyes with &s;uch a
Lu&s;tre, that 'tis a meer Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in fa|vour
of the De&s;ign it&s;elf, he is half
engaged before he looks into the In&s;ide:
This makes him &s;ee every Thing afterward
with an already-bia&s;s'd Judgment, and the
Sight of his Under&s;tanding is dazzled, &s;o
that he &s;ees every Thing near hand double,
and Thing remote not at all.</P>
<P>BY this Delu&s;ion, the Man is too apt to be
drawn into the Snare, clo&s;es eagerly with a
new projected Scheme, jumps at the Bait,
and &s;ees not the Hook; and many an inno|cent
unthinking Trade&s;man is ruined by the&s;e
Precipitations. But the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s takes
Things quite another Way; he weighs eve|ry
Part with a calm Mind and a &s;teady Judg|ment;
he has, what the late King <HI>William</HI>
&s;aid of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a warm
Heart, and a cool Head; his Pul&s;e beats high
for the Profit of a Bu&s;ine&s;s, as high as any
Man's, but his Hand will not go before his
<PB N="81" REF="93">
Head; his Act and Deed will not run be|fore
his Judgment; he maturely con&s;iders
and weighs every Article, &s;tates the Ac|count
of Profit and Lo&s;s, with an Equality
of Judgment, and wi&s;ely &s;tands ready to
give the Negative, as ea&s;ily as the Affirma|tive,
if he &s;ees an Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE real Difficulty of this is a Te&s;timo|ny,
that a Compleat Trade&s;man mu&s;t be no
Fool; there is much more of the wi&s;e Man
to be &s;een in the Negative, than in the Af|firmative,
in almo&s;t all the Parts of Life.
'Tis one of the Characters of a Man of
Sen&s;e, that he knows how to &s;ay No. How
many well-natur'd, ea&s;y-temper'd, good-hu|mour'd
Gentlemen are ruined in the World,
ruined in their Morals, in their Fortunes, in
their Pro&s;pects, meerly for Want of this hap|py
Negative, for Want of the Power of
&s;aying No.</P>
<P>SOCIETY tempts, a plea&s;ant Companion in|vites,
this Friend &s;ends, and that Friend calls;
the ea&s;y, good-humoured, weak Creature,
goes immediately; he has no Power to re&s;i&s;t;
he has no Negative, he cannot &s;ay No, and
away he goes, be it to the Tavern, or to a
wor&s;e Hou&s;e; nay, be it to the Gaming-Ta|ble,
or &s;till wor&s;e, the Highway.</P>
<P>BUT the rough po&s;itive Temper is the &s;afe
Man; that can be &s;urly, and if he di&s;likes
the Propo&s;als, however his Inclination may
tempt him, yet turns upon his Heel, and
<PB N="82" REF="94">
&s;ays No; that's the Man that e&s;capes the Dan|ger.</P>
<P>IT is the &s;ame Thing in Trade: The &s;afe
Man is he that can &s;ay No; who con&s;idering
all the Circum&s;tances of a Propo&s;al, and
weighing the bad again&s;t the good, the pro|bable
Mi&s;carriage again&s;t the probable Suc|ce&s;s,
maturely &s;ays No; declines the Propo|&s;al,
and avoids the Danger; is content to be
&s;afe rather than rich, to be ea&s;y rather than
bu&s;y, that is, cautious of Hazard, as well as
forward for Profit.</P>
<P>THIS, therefore, is the Wi&s;dom of a Trade&s;|man,
and it requires a great Share of Un|der&s;tanding,
as well as of Prudence, to guide
the Man of Bu&s;ine&s;s in this Part; for it is
a difficult Thing, and the wife&s;t Man may
be mi&s;taken; he may refu&s;e an Advantage
as well on one Hand, and (as they call it in
the Language of Trade) &s;tand in his own
Light, as well as avoid a Lo&s;s on t'other;
all that can be &s;aid is, he mu&s;t judge for him|&s;elf:
And that brings me back to the Propo|&s;itions
advanc'd above, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Trade&s;|man
mu&s;t be no Fool.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, a Set of Men in the
World, and in our particular <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> World
of Trade too, for that is what I mean by our
World, who have but a very mean Share of
Under&s;tanding, and yet carry on great Trades,
go through a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
with Succe&s;s too; nay, &s;ome are of Opi|nion,
<PB N="83" REF="95">
that the&s;e downright empty-headed
Trade&s;men are the &s;a&s;e&s;t, and be&s;t, and the
mo&s;t likely to thrive; and we often find it
&s;o.</P>
<P>BUT then I mu&s;t add, the&s;e are generally
Men, who either have a certain natural Cau|tion
in their Tempers, which guides them to
&s;ay No, as above, though they do it without
any Act of their Judgment, becau&s;e they have
little or no Judgment to act with; Or that
have a kind of a Sagacity, as the Birds e&s;pe|cially,
and al&s;o other Brutes have, to be
afraid of every Body, and &s;o they tru&s;t no
Body; they are &s;hy of every Thing that
&s;tirs, and every Body that offers; believe
every Body will bite them, and cheat them,
and by this they are &s;ecured; nothing can
hurt them, for they meddle with nothing;
no Body can cheat them, becau&s;e they tru&s;t
no Body; no Body deceives them, becau&s;e
they believe no Body.</P>
<P>BUT this kind of general Jealou&s;y of
Mankind, is not the Act or Effect of the
Trade&s;man's Judgment; it is not his Wi&s;|dom,
as I was ju&s;t now &s;peaking, and the
Perfection of his Trading Prudence; but 'tis
a meer brutal Part, gro&s;s and rough, &s;ordid|ly
ignorant, and neither guided by Rea&s;on,
or by the Nature of the Thing; 'tis neither
an Act of Prudence or of Fore&s;ight, but a
meer Part of &s;urly Ignorance, and Humour:
Such Men as the&s;e, as they are &s;afe from
<PB N="84" REF="96">
the Accident of their Temper, &s;o they are
rich, if it &s;o happens to them, meerly from
the Con&s;equence of being <HI>So and So</HI> &s;tated in
a Round of Bu&s;ine&s;s, by the Accident of
their Situation; having perhaps jump'd into
a Shop, or into a Trade, by Succe&s;&s;ion to
Parents or Ma&s;ters, who left it to them; and &s;o
Coing right forward, like the Carrier's Hor&s;e
in the Road, where they were always u&s;ed
to travel; as they would be lo&s;t if they were
but ju&s;t turn'd out into a &s;trange Track,
where they had never gone before, &s;o they
are ob&s;tinate again&s;t all Propo&s;als, that may
turn them out of the old Path.</P>
<P>THEIR Succe&s;s, I &s;ay, is the meer Effect
of their Situation in Trade; and if they are
put out of the Road of Bu&s;ine&s;s, they are
lo&s;t; they neither know to go on, or how to
find their Way into the Road again from
whence they come.</P>
<P>THESE are a &s;ort of Pa&s;&s;ive People, who
&s;tand as an Exception again&s;t a general Rule;
who thrive in their Ignorance, and grow rich,
not by their Wi&s;dom, but meerly by being
Fools; meerly becau&s;e they were in the Road,
and had neither Courage or Under&s;tanding
to go out of it.</P>
<P>BUT if a Fool in Trade happens to thrive,
and perhaps thrives becau&s;e he is a Fool, yet
it does not at all argue agai&s;t my Propo&s;i|tion,
that a Trade&s;man &s;hould be a Man of
Sen&s;e. If the hon&s;t Trade&s;men were all
<PB N="85" REF="97">
Fools, the t'other Half, I mean the K&mdash;s
Trade&s;men, would be all Aldermen, that is
to &s;ay, all rich; for they would &s;oon make
their Market of their Neighbours; for all
the Foods would not be wary and cautious,
like him hinted at above, and the re&s;t would
be undone; in a word, a Fool may be a
Trade&s;man, but the Compleat Trade&s;man I
&s;peak of mu&s;t not be a Fool.</P>
<P>NOR could &s;uch wife Fools as that I have
de&s;crib'd, carry on the va&s;t Inland Commerce
of this Nation: Here and there a weak Man
acting within his own narrow Circle, and
having the Pattern of wi&s;er Heads round
him, to be as it were, his Pole-Star to &s;teer
by, may go plodding on, as I have &s;aid,
and may do well enough, may act with a
little, and keep him&s;elf up tolerably well:
But when we come to de&s;cribe a Man of Cor|re&s;pondence
and of general Trade, a Man
carrying on a Head of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and, as we
&s;ay, driving the World before him; the poor
empty-headed Man I &s;peak of, mu&s;t not be
the Man; his Capacity is not equal to it;
as his Under&s;tanding is confin'd, &s;o mu&s;t his
Corre&s;pondence; a large Bu&s;ine&s;s would be
too much for his Head, if it was not too
much for his Hands; as his Brains are limit|ed,
&s;o would his Circle of Bu&s;ine&s;s be re|&s;trained;
and it would appear, he could ne|ver
be a Compleat Trade&s;man, becau&s;e he
was a Fool.</P>

which naturally attend a pro&s;perous

<P>_WE are now to &s;uppo&s;e a Trade&s;man,

<P>I'LL take it for granted too, that having

Reputation and Character in the World:
And there are three Characters; one of which
a Trade&s;man of &s;uch &s;tanding generally
comes under the Name of, whether with
good or bad Fame.</P>
<Q><P>1. THAT he has been a <HI>Hard-Head,</HI> a
Devourer, a <HI>Jew;</HI> for the&s;e and more
<PB N="87" REF="99">
&s;uch are the general Titles by which &s;uch
Trade&s;men are u&s;ually di&s;tingui&s;h'd and
known; that he will let no Body live
by him, that he will skin a Flint, that
he will buy cheaper than any Man
can &s;ell, and &s;ell dearer than any Man
can buy; that he cares not who &s;inks
if he can but &s;wim; that he grinds the
Faces of his Workmen, and will hard|ly
let a poor Man live by his Labour:
Thus he has got what he has by gri|ping
and &s;queezing of labouring Men;
and that it will never thrive with him,
<HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>2. OR they tell you he has got it by
<HI>Sharping</HI> and <HI>Trickin,</HI> undermining
of his Neighbours, worming People
out of their Intere&s;t in Things, and
&s;etting up Bubbles and Bites to cheat
the World with; that he is a Man of
no <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> that cares not who lo&s;es
&s;o he can but gain; that he (in a word)
cheats every Body if he can, but takes
care no Body &s;hall cheat him; that he
has been a Knave in his Dealing, over|reaching
and defrauding wherever he
could; that &s;o he did but get Money,
he car'd not how he got it, nor of
whom; that he neither valued the
Ble&s;&s;ing of the Rich, or the Cur&s;es of
the Poor, &s;o he could but get Money by
them. This is a dreadful Character,
<PB N="88" REF="100">
it mu&s;t be cofe&s;&s;s'd; and that there
are &s;ome Trade&s;men that de&s;erve it,
mu&s;t al&s;o be granted: But the next is
a brighter Side by a great deal, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>3. THAT he is an hone&s;t, open-hearted,
generous, fair-dealing Trade&s;man; that
every Body &s;peaks well of him, loves
to deal with him; and whether they
get or lo&s;e by him, they are always
plea&s;ed; that he treats the Rich with
good Manners, and the Poor with good
Language, is courteous and kind to
all People, and that in particular he is a
punctual Pay-Ma&s;ter; that when he has
made a Bargain, whether he gets or
lo&s;es by it, he always performs it, and
without Murmuring or Cavilling; that
he takes no unju&s;t Advantage, does not
lie upon the Catch to &s;upplant any
Body, and &s;corns, in &s;hort, to do an
ill Thing, though he might gain by
it; that his Word is as &s;acred as his
Bond; that he never grinds the Face of
the Poor, but pays for his Work chear|fully
and readily, and is content to let
poor Men live by him; that he &s;corns
to make Mi&s;take pa&s;s for Payment, or
to lie upon the Catch to trapan his
Neighbour; in a word, that he is a
fair, downright, hone&s;t Man, God has
ble&s;t him, and every Body gives him a
good Word.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="89" REF="101">
I believe I may venture to &s;ay, that one
of the&s;e three Characters takes in almo&s;t all
the thriving Part of our Trade&s;men, let
them be of what Trade, or of what kind
of Bu&s;ine&s;s they will: It is true, there are
&s;ome who come under a middling kind of
Half-in-Half Character, and are neither well
&s;poken of, or ill &s;poken of; neither well
thought of, or ill thought of; no People
hardly know what to make of them, or
what to &s;ay to them; they are clo&s;e and
concealed, hone&s;t in Shew, and never bite
and devour, but when no Body &s;ees them,
and when they can do it &s;ecurely; that
are fond of being called hone&s;t Men, and
make as if they would de&s;erve it; but cut
&s;harp, go clo&s;e to the Brink of Knavery, tho'
they would not be thought to &s;tep out be|yond
their Bounds; that keep them&s;elves to
them&s;elves; and, in a word, no Body knows
where to have them.</P>
<P>THESE mu&s;t be what they are; as no Bo|dy
&s;peaks much ill of them, &s;o I &s;hall &s;ay
little well of them, only this, that they are
none of the People that will rai&s;e the Credit
of the Trade&s;men in general to any great
Height; and when a Slanderer tells us that
all Trade&s;men mu&s;t be K&mdash;, we cannot
bring this Trade&s;man out for a Voucher in
their Behalf.</P>
<P>BUT now, to &s;peak of the Trade&s;man as
&s;uch, let his ju&s;t Character be as it will, what is
<PB N="90" REF="102">
his Bu&s;ine&s;s now he is, as we &s;ay, thriven,
and grown rich; he under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
or el&s;e he would not have gone on &s;o well;
but let me tell him, he is not pa&s;t the Dan|ger
yet; Men of the be&s;t Figures in Trade
have met with a Fall, and have made a Slip
at la&s;t, which at one Blow have ruin'd all
their Pro&s;pects, bla&s;ted them at once, and
overthrown at one Blow all their twenty
Years Labour: Witne&s;s the late Directors
of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and let their
Fall be ju&s;t or unju&s;t, that is not my Bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
perhaps I am not of the &s;ame Opi|nion
with the general Clamour under which
they fell; but this Part is exactly to my
pre&s;ently Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>MANY of tho&s;e Gentlemen were Trade&s;|men
of long &s;tanding; they had behav'd &s;o
as to have obtain'd, and as I have heard,
to de&s;erve an un&s;potted Reputation in Trade:
If they were not hone&s;t Men, there were
indeed no hone&s;t Men in Trade in the World,
nay, &s;ome received that Te&s;timony even in
the very Article of their Misfortune, and
may be&s;aid to fall, only in con&s;equence of
the Title they bore, and the Office they
were embarked in, tho' it appeared they had
not acted one way or other; but if I may
u&s;e the Words of an infinitely &s;uperior Ca&s;e,
they were number'd with Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>YET the&s;e Men fell into Ruin; as Down
a Precipice, ingulph'd at once in the common
<PB N="91" REF="103">
Calamity; as Directors without directing; as
guilty, tho' innocent; as blackened with the
general Calumny, tho' not particularly ca|lumniated.</P>

how were they &s;ent into the Wil|derne&s;s
like the 'Scape Goat, with the Sins
of their Superiors upon their Heads, bearing
the Burden for other People's Crimes, and
linking, as it were, on purpo&s;e, to let others
&s;wim.</P>
<P>BUT not to enter into particular Ca&s;es any
farther than to make them Examples for the
Caution of others, and to intimate to the
World, how they ought to act in the Conduct
of Trading Life, which is the mo&s;t intricate
of all human Mea&s;ures; let the People I
am writing to take the Hint, and than leave
the Per&s;ons to their own Oppre&s;&s;ions, which
are heavy enough: The U&s;e of it to us in
the Ca&s;e before me is this.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man is never &s;afe; his Condition
is &s;ubjected to innumerable Ca&s;ualties, and
to unavoidable Di&s;a&s;ters: No E&s;tate is &s;o big
as not to be in Hazard, no Po&s;ture of his
Affairs out of the Reach of Accidents; while
he continues in Trade, like a Seaman, tho'
he is at the Mouth of the Harbour, nay,
tho' &s;afe in the Port, and come to an An|chor,
he can never &s;ay he is entirely out
of Danger, and perfectly &s;afe, till he has &s;et
both Feet &s;afe on Shore; in the Mer|chandize

on board 'tis the &s;ame, the Voyage
is not ended till the Goods are landed, and
in the Merchant's Warehou&s;e.</P>
<P>IN like manner, the Trade&s;man is not pa&s;t
the Danger till his Bottom is wound up;
and if he continues in Trade, we may &s;ay
of him, he is never perfectly &s;afe till he is
nail'd up between two Elm Boards; never
out of Danger till he is in his Grave; no
State of Pro&s;perity &s;o high, or &s;o great, but
&s;ome have fallen from as high a Condition.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw a Spectacle, which, tho' I was
entirely unconcern'd, mov'd me &s;o much,
that it brought Tears into my Eyes in &s;pite

mu&s;t a little affect the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Reader.

<P>THESE are recent Te&s;timonies that no Pro&s;|perity
in Trade is out of the Reach of Di|&s;a&s;ter;
&s;o that the Trade&s;man can never call
him&s;elf a &s;afe Man, till he is entirely drawn
out of Trade, and, as I &s;aid before, landed
in the Grave, or in his Country Retreat,
and can &s;ay, he has no more to do with Bu|&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>HENCE then, the Trade&s;man is not above
Caution, let his Condition be what it will:
My Caution is this, never to run out of his
Bu&s;ine&s;s into Hazards, great Undertakings,
<PB N="96" REF="108">
capital Adventures, wild Experiments upon
Pre&s;umption of Succe&s;s, and upon Pro&s;pect
of new Advantage and farther Gain: Me|thinks
a Man that has once 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket, &s;hould not want to be advi&s;ed to be
&s;atisfied with the Road of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which
has rais'd him to that Height, and not to
hazard a Fall, in order to ri&s;e higher.</P>
<P>HE that is not &s;atisfied, and does not think
him&s;elf rich enough with 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket, neither would he be &s;atisfied one Jot
the more, if he had five Times that Sum.
Where was the Man in the late di&s;tracted
Times, who thought him&s;elf well, and &s;at
&s;till content with the mo&s;t immen&s;e Sum?
had it been po&s;&s;ible, we had not had &s;o many
ruined Families now among us, cur&s;ing their
own Avarice, and lamenting their Folly; I
was worth &s;o much and &s;o much; &s;ome
50000 <HI>l.</HI> &s;ome twice as much, but could not
be content, and &s;o fool'd it away all.</P>
<P>LET the wi&s;e and wary Trade&s;man take
the Hint, keep within the Bounds where
Providence has placed him, be content to ri&s;e
gradually and gently, as he has done; and
as he is &s;ufficiently rich, if he will make
it more, let it be in the old Road; go &s;oftly
on, lea&s;t he comes not &s;oftly down.</P>
<P>PRECIPITATIONS of all Kinds are dangerous;
a Trade&s;man ri&s;es gently, but he falls ha&s;ti|ly;
nay, which is wor&s;e than all the re&s;t,
and is particular to the Di&s;a&s;ters of Trade, a
<PB N="97" REF="109">
Trade&s;man &s;eldom &s;tumbles, but he falls;
the Rea&s;on lies here, the lea&s;t Slip of a
Trade&s;man touches his Credit, and if his Cre|dit
is touch'd, the Trade&s;man is gone: He
may &s;truggle for &s;ome Time, and if his Bot|tom
is very good, he may perhaps keep him|&s;elf
from a mortal Wound; but let his Bot|tom
be what it will, he rarely recovers it in
Trade, never goes on chearfully and tho|roughly
if his Credit is hurt by the Blow:
'Tis like &s;ome Di&s;ea&s;es, which, tho' they may
be cur'd as the Phy&s;icians call a Cure, yet
they leave a Taint in the Blood, which is ne|ver
thoroughly carried off, but breaks out
again upon all Occa&s;ions of other Illne&s;s,
and the Man is never perfectly &s;ound while
he lives.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that when a Man is
once grown rich, his Dependance upon Cre|dit
is at an End; what cares he? or rather,
what need he care for Credit, that has twen|ty
thou&s;and Pounds in his Pocket?</P>
<P>I would rather &s;ay, what need he care for
Trade, that has twenty thou&s;and Pound in
his Pocket? why &s;hould he trade any farther?
and what need he de&s;ire any more, that has
&s;uch a Bank? 'Tis Time to leave off and
have done; 'tis Time to leave labouring for
the World, when he has the World, as they
call it, in a String.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am of Opinion, it would be
much better for the publick Intere&s;t of Trade,
<PB N="98" REF="110">
and for the Trade&s;men too, if every Man that
is advan$'d in Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o as to be worth
twenty thou&s;and Pounds, &s;hould leave off;
as I have &s;aid above, that it would be
much better for Trade, and for the publick
State of Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o I add now, 'twould be
much better for the Nation in general, that
twenty Trade&s;men, with each a thou&s;and
Pound in his Pocket, were employ'd in
Trade, than one Trade&s;man with twenty
thou&s;and Pounds. For fir&s;t, the &s;ame Trade
would then maintain twenty Families, which
now &s;upports but one. 2. Tho&s;e twenty Fa|milies,
would in con&s;equence, have abun|dance
of Dependencies more upon them,
than one &s;ingle Family, let that one Family
make as good a Figure in Trade as they will.
3. The twenty Families would act, with le&s;s
Danger to one another, and to Trade in
general, than one over-rich Trade&s;man
does, or can do.</P>
<P>I explain my &s;elf thus:
<Q>1. The Number of Families maintain'd
by Trade, while the Commerce it &s;elf
is under no Oppre&s;&s;ion by them, is a
vi&s;ible Benefit, nay, even a Ble&s;&s;ing to
the Nation, where the Trade is carried
currently on, as that Increa&s;e of People,
is a Ble&s;&s;ing in it &s;elf; but 'tis a far|ther
Benefit too, as it is an Increa&s;e of
the diligent Part of the People, an In|crea&s;e
<PB N="99" REF="111">
not of Vagrants and indigent Peo|ple;
Mouths that are unprofitable and
that live upon the Labour of other Peo|ple,
more capable or more indu&s;trious
than them&s;elves; but as it is an Increa&s;e
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and of People to do it: An
Increa&s;e of Labour always brings Hands
together to perform it, and the multiply|ing
of diligent labouring People, where
Work is found to employ them, is cer|tainly
a publick Benefit to the Nation.</Q></P>
<P>I cannot think I &s;hould be ask'd &s;o weak a
Que&s;tion, whether a Trade carried on by
twenty Ma&s;ter-Trade&s;man, with each Man a
thou&s;and Pound in Stock, &s;hall not nece&s;&s;ari|ly
employ more People than that &s;ame Trade,
carried on by one Ma&s;ter-Trade&s;man, with
the &s;ame Stock united in one Hand; the Fact is
&s;o ea&s;ily to be demon&s;trated, that it will hardly
bear the Name of a Que&s;tion. Suppo&s;e it was
only that they keep every one an Apprentice,
and one other Servant, it cannot be &s;ugge&s;ted,
that the other Trade&s;man, tho' with twenty
thou&s;and Pounds in his Pocket, would keep
twenty Apprentices and twenty Servants, be
it almo&s;t of any Trade whatever; and if it
was not a Shop-Keeping Trade, but an Em|ployment
that required &s;ome Hands, yet the
rich Ma&s;ter-Trade&s;man could not employ
twenty Times the Number of Men, as the
&s;ingle thou&s;and Pound Man would do; &s;o
<PB N="100" REF="112">
that even that Way the common Intere&s;t
lies be&s;t in the twenty Hands than in one.</P>
<P>ADD to this what relates to the &s;econd
Con&s;ideration above, <HI>viz.</HI> that the twenty
Trade&s;men mu&s;t inhabit twenty Hou&s;es, pay
abundantly a greater Proportion to all Man|ner
of Taxes, be rated perhaps twenty Times
as much to the Poor, to Pari&s;h Taxes, to
the Church, to the Highways, and to every
per&s;onal Rate; for &s;ometimes the Trade&s;man,
with his twenty thou&s;and Pounds Stock, may
live in no better a Hou&s;e than the Trade&s;man
with a thou&s;and Pounds Stock; &s;o that in
all the&s;e Ca&s;es the dividing Trade into many
Hands, is a much greater Advantage to the
Publick, than to have it continued in one
Hand only.</P>
<P>AS to the la&s;t Head, <HI>viz.</HI> that it would be
better for Trade it&s;elf, 'tis an Article of par|ticular
Moment in the Subject I am upon, and
brings me forward to the immediate Subject of
the next Chapter, relating to Mi&s;chiefs or|dinarily
attending Trade, from the Encroach|ings,
Engro&s;&s;ings, and other avaricious Mea|&s;ures
which are often the Con&s;equences of an
over-grown Trade&s;man's pu&s;hing &s;till on
when he is too great and too powerful for
his Neighbours.</P>
<P>THOSE Trade&s;men, who, tho' increas'd
in their Trade, can &s;et no Bounds to their De|&s;ires;
who neither know when they have
enough, or when they have too much, are
<PB N="101" REF="113">
oftentimes fatal in their Mea&s;ures, not only
to their Neighbours in Trade, but even to
Trade it&s;elf; and therefore the Publick is
&s;ometimes oblig'd to make Laws again&s;t them
to re&s;train their Exorbitancies and Exce&s;&s;es,
and to prevent their eating up the little
Trade&s;men about them.</P>
<P>THESE are the Laws again&s;t Extortion,
taking large Intere&s;t for Money, engro&s;&s;ing
particular Commodities, fore&s;talling Mar|kets,
Combinations in Trade, and the like;
all which are the Effects of large over|match'd
Stocks, and the Capital Projects of
money'd Men in Trade; and if it were not for
&s;uch Laws, &s;ometimes the &s;maller Trade&s;|men
would be over-run, be foreclos'd in
Trade, and be left to &s;tand at their Shops
or Shop-Doors unemploy'd, and without
Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, 'tis evident, that an
over-grown or over-rich Trade&s;man, pu&s;hing
&s;till on in Trade, is really far from being a
publick Benefit to Trade it&s;elf in the gene|ral,
or to the Country where he lives; or it
is far from a Benefit to Trade to have it con|tracted
in a few Hands, to have it circulate
in Gro&s;s, and be manag'd by a few Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>I might run it out, for farther Explana|tion,
into the particular manufacturing
Trade&s;men, where it is much more to be &s;een
than in the Shop-Keeping Part; but I &s;hall
&s;peak of it again at large in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="114">
I return therefore to the rich Trade&s;man,
who&s;e Ca&s;e was the principal Subject of this
Chapter: Two Things are ab&s;olutely nece&s;|&s;ary
to him to take into his Concern, and
are never below him, &s;o long as Trade it&s;elf
is not below him.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> HE is to be cautious &s;till of not launch|ing
out beyond him&s;elf: Nothing of its kind
is more common than for the Trade&s;man,
when he once finds him&s;elf grown rich, to
have his Head full of great De&s;igns and
new Undertakings. He finds his Ca&s;h flow
in upon him, and perhaps he is fuller of
Money than his Trade calls for; and as he
&s;carce knows how to employ more Stock in
it than he does, his Ears are the &s;ooner
open to any Project or Propo&s;al that offers
it&s;elf; and I mu&s;t add, that this is the mo&s;t
critical Time with him in all his Life; if
ever he is danger of Ruin, 'tis ju&s;t then.</P>
<Q><P>1. HE is fir&s;t of the Opinion, that as he has
an over-grown Stock, he ought to em|ploy
it, and that no Money ought to
lie idle; what though it is an Adven|ture
a little out of his Way, he only
employs &s;ome loo&s;e Corns in it, &s;ome
&s;mall Sums that he can &s;pare, and which
he does not value; if he lo&s;es them it
won't hurt him, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="115">
2. THAT 'tis a probable Undertaking; that
it may hit, and then he &s;hall do his Bu|&s;ine&s;s
at once; and then comes all the
great Things into his Head that am|bitious
Men fire their Thoughts with,
which turn the Windmill of his Brain
&s;o fa&s;t, that they make him delirious in
Trade, and he is a meer Trade Luna|tick
ever after.</P></Q>
<P>THIS therefore, I &s;ay, is the mo&s;t critical
Time of a Trade&s;man's Life; at this Moment
he is more in Danger of being undone than
ever he was when he had not 500<HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket. For,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HE ought to be told, that no
Trade&s;man is out of Danger of being un|done
while he continues in Trade, that no
E&s;tate, no over-grown Circum&s;tance is too
great to be ruin'd by a Project; nay, the
greater and &s;tronger his Stock, and the vainer
he is of it, the more Danger he is in of run|ning
&s;ome bold Adventure, which may at
la&s;t give him a mortal Wound, and hazard
the Overthrow of all his Fortunes at once.
I could name &s;uch Examples of this, that
has happened within our own Knowledge and
Memory, that would put it out of all Que&s;|tion;
and I forbear meerly becau&s;e I would
not open the Wounds of the unhappy Suf|ferers,
<PB N="104" REF="116">
and bring the Mi&s;erable upon the
Stage again, to renew their Sorrows.</P>
<P>HE that in this World thinks him&s;elf &s;e|cure
again&s;t the Shocks of Fortune, as we
may well call them, &s;eems either to know
very little of the World, or to think but lit|tle
of what he does know: No Station is
above Di&s;a&s;ter; and no Man is &s;o &s;ubject to
them, as he that having a &s;trong Fund, is yet
for pu&s;hing at more, not knowing when he
has enough, or not &s;atisfied with enough.
As Ambition is the Ruin of the greate&s;t Mo|narch
when he gra&s;ps at, and would devour
his innocent neighbouring Princes and States,
&s;o <HI>Avarice</HI> is often the Ruin of the greate&s;t
Trade&s;men, when not &s;atisfied with having
gain'd a plentiful Fortune by their Diligence
and Application, they are re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h at
greater Things than they can gra&s;p, launch
out of their Depth in Trade, and blinded with
the Vanity of their projected Hopes, do not
&s;ee their Danger.</P>
<P>AN ill Pilot as &s;oon lo&s;es a great Ship as
a &s;mall, and a rich Cargo is as ea&s;ily &s;hip|wreck'd
as a poor: The Rocks and Sands which
lie under Water hid and conceal'd, are as
dangerous to a Man of War as to a Merchant
Ship; and the Number of its Guns, which
makes it terrible to other Enemies, are ra|ther
In&s;truments to forward its Ruin, in ca&s;e
of Tempe&s;ts and Storms, than Helps to deli|ver
it.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="117">
THE richer the Trade&s;man is, the bolder
he is apt to be in his Adventures, not being to
be &s;o ea&s;ily wounded by a Lo&s;s; but as the
Game&s;ter is tempted to throw again, to re|trieve
the pa&s;t Lo&s;s, &s;o one Adventure in
Trade draws in another, till at la&s;t comes a
capital Lo&s;s, which weakens the Stock, and
which wounds the Reputation; and thus, by
one Lo&s;s coming in the Neck of another,
the Trade&s;man is fir&s;t made de&s;perate, in his
De&s;peration ventures at all, and &s;o is at once
undone.</P>
<P>IF any Man &s;hould be &s;o ill-natur'd as to
tell me I &s;peak too feelingly upon this Part
of the Subject, though it may not be the
kinde&s;t Thing he could have &s;aid to a poor
Author, yet it may not be the wor&s;e for
the Argument: An old Sailor, that has &s;plit
upon a &s;unk Rock, and has lo&s;t his Ship, is
not the wor&s;t Man to make a Pilot of for
that Coa&s;t; on the contrary, he is in par|ticular
able to guide tho&s;e that come after
him to &s;hun the Dangers of that unhappy
Place.</P>
<P>TRADE is a &s;afe Channel to tho&s;e that
keep in the <HI>fair Way,</HI> (&s;o the Sailors call the
ordinary Entrance into an Harbour;) but
if in Contempt of Dangers, and of fair
Warnings, any Man will run out of the
Cour&s;e, neglect the Buoys and Marks which
are &s;et up by the Publick for the Direction
of Sailors, and, at all Hazards, venture
<PB N="106" REF="118">
among the Rocks, he is to blame no body
but him&s;elf if he lo&s;es his Ship.</P>
<P>THE Sum of the Matter is this; That no
Trade&s;man, however rich and pro&s;perous,
&s;hould think him&s;elf out of the Reach of
Mi&s;fortunes in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and therefore none
&s;hould run upon needle&s;s Hazards and Diffi|culties,
in confidence of their own good Suc|ce&s;s
in Things pa&s;t, and upon the A&s;&s;urance
of their Strength of Stock, no Condition
being beyond the Reach of Di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>HOW unpitied do &s;uch Men fall? how
does the World reproach them with Stupidi|ty
and Folly, when they who had no need
to hazard them&s;elves, run into unlikely Ad|venturings,
and ruin them&s;elves without
Cau&s;e; who thinking them&s;elves &s;afe, fall
when no body throws them down, and &s;ur|prize
the World with their Di&s;a&s;ters, when
every one thought them &s;ecure from all Di|fa&s;ter?</P>
<P>I
know no State of Life, I mean in that
we call the Middle Station of it, and among
the &s;eni&s;ible Part of Mankind, which is more
&s;uited to make Men perfectly ea&s;y, and com|fortable
to them&s;elves, than that of a thriving
Trade&s;man: He &s;eems not only thoroughly
&s;ettled with Re&s;pect to his Circum&s;tances,
but that Settlement &s;eems the be&s;t &s;ecur'd and
e&s;tabli&s;h'd; and tho' he is not uncapable of a
Di&s;a&s;ter, yet is in the be&s;t Manner fenc'd
again&s;t it of any Man whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="119">
HIS Life is perfectly ea&s;y, &s;urrounded
with Delights; every Way his Pro&s;pect is
good; if he is a Man of Sen&s;e, he has the
be&s;t Phylo&s;ophick Retreats that any Station
of Life offers him: He is able to retire from
Hurry, to contemplate his own Felicity, and
to &s;ee it the lea&s;t encumber'd of any State
of the middle Part of Life: And as the low
State of Life is in it&s;elf the be&s;t qualified to
make a Man really happy, &s;o he has the
be&s;t Station in that low State.</P>
<P>HE is below the Snares of the Great, and
above the Contempt of tho&s;e that are call'd
Low: His Bu&s;ine&s;s is a Road of Life, with
few or no uneven Places in it; no chequer'd
Work, no Hills and Dales in it, no Woods
and Wilderne&s;&s;es to lo&s;e his Way, and wan|der
in: Plenty &s;urrounds him, and the In|crea&s;e
flows in daily: Like a &s;welling Tide,
he has a Flood without an Overwhelming;
Deeps without Drowning, Heights without
falling: He is a &s;afe Man, nothing can hurt
him but him&s;elf: If he comes into any Mi&s;|chiefs,
they are of his own chu&s;ing; if he falls,
'tis his own doing, and he has no body to
blame but him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man, when he has thriven and
grown rich by his Trade; how he ought to
act with regard to the Publick Intere&s;t
of Trade, as it re&s;pects the Country he
lives in; and of its being nece&s;&s;ary that
Trade &s;hould run through as many Hands
as it can.</HEAD>
<P>_IT does not follow, that becau&s;e a
Trade&s;man is grown rich by Trade,
that therefore he mu&s;t turn a general
Devourer and De&s;troyer of the Trade
it&s;elf, as well as of his Neighbour Trade&s;|man;
that he mu&s;t, or may make Ravages
and Depredations by the Greatne&s;s of his
Stock, and run down, and ruin, not only the
Trade&s;men about him, but the Trade it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THERE is a due Regard, which Ju&s;tice
claims from him, even after his own Bu&s;ine&s;s
is done, to pre&s;erve as far as may be fairly
and hone&s;tly to him&s;elf, the Intere&s;t of the
Trade in general, as well as his own Inte|re&s;t
in particular; and thus in all his Me|thods
of carrying on his Trade. An hone&s;t
Sailor, when by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Expe|rience
<PB N="109" REF="121">
he knows the Entrance, and how to car|ry
his Ship &s;afe into Harbour, will do nothing
to bar or block up the Pa&s;&s;age again&s;t tho&s;e
that come after him: On the contrary, he
leaves all the Marks and Buoys which have
been a Guide to him, exactly in their fir&s;t Po|&s;ition,
that others may &s;teer with Safety the
&s;ame Way after him.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems not unju&s;t only, but a little mali|cious,
that when a Trade&s;man is got into a
Channel of Trade, by his Succe&s;s in which he
has gain'd an E&s;tate, he &s;hould purpo&s;ely ren|der
that Channel impracticable to others. For
Example:</P>
<P>THERE is a Maxim in Trade, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI>
e&s;pecially in the Home Trade, which will ever
remain true as long as Trade bears its Name in
the World, <HI>viz.</HI> That the more Hands it
goes through, the greater publick Advantage
it is to the Country it is carried on or mana|ged
in; and therefore, it is not always the
true Intere&s;t of a Manufacturer in this or that
particular Place, to &s;horten or le&s;&s;en the need|ful
Expence of Trade, tho' it &s;hould render
the Goods &s;omething the cheaper at Market.</P>
<Q>N. B. I am not &s;peaking now of Foreign,
but of Home Trade, and Goods for a
Home Con&s;umption; it mu&s;t be always
true, that it is our Intere&s;t to &s;end our
Manufacture as cheap to a foreign Mar|ket
as we can, e&s;pecially where they
<PB N="110" REF="122">
are rivalled by other Manufactures of
the &s;ame or a like kind. But even in
that Ca&s;e, it were better that Encourage|ment
were given to the Exportation, by
taking off Impo&s;ts or Duties payable
on the &s;aid Exportation, and even by
Bounties given by the Publick to en|courage
the Merchant, than by Depre|dations
upon the Trade it &s;elf.</Q>
<P>EVERY Manufacture has its proper Chan|nel
of Trade, after it is fini&s;hed as a Manu|facture;
as it is made in this or that particu|lar
Country remote from <HI>London,</HI> it is, gene|rally
&s;peaking, &s;ent up to <HI>London</HI> for Sale:
There it is &s;old by a Factor or Warehou&s;e|Keeper
to the Merchant for Exportation, or
to the Shop-Keeper for retailing, or to the
Whole&s;ale-Man, for &s;ending again into other
Countries proper for its Sale, and to the
Shop-Keepers there for Retail, and &s;o on.</P>
<P>THE growing of the Wool, and the wearing
of the Cloths, are the two Extremes of Trade;
the Beginning and End of all Manufacturing
and Management about it. The Sheep-Ma&s;|ter,
who &s;heers and &s;ells the Fleece,
and the Shop-Keeper, who &s;ells the Cloth
or Cloths ready made by Retail, are the
fir&s;t and the la&s;t Trade&s;men concerned in the
whole Trade: Now to bring it directly to
the Point, and that the meane&s;t Capacity may
under&s;tand me, I ob&s;erve here, that the more
<PB N="111" REF="123">
Hands this Manufacture, &s;uppo&s;e of Cloths
or Stuff, pa&s;&s;es through, either in the Work|man&s;hip,
or Carriage, or Sale of the Goods;
and which the Goods them&s;elves are able to
&s;pport, &s;o much the greater Benefit is that
Manufacture to the publick Stock of the Na|tion,
becau&s;e the Employment of the People is
the great and main Benefit of Trade.</P>
<P>IT is not an Equivalent to &s;ay, that the
Wearer or Con&s;umer &s;hall buy the Cloth or
Stuff Six Pence or a Shilling a Yard, or a
Suit of Cloaths Two or Three Shillings the
cheaper; for though that would be &s;ome Be|nefit
to him in private, yet it is not, I &s;ay, an
Equivalent to the finding Bread and Sub&s;i&s;|tance,
as it pa&s;&s;es, for &s;ix or &s;even Families,
who might otherwi&s;e gain their Living by
that Manufacture, if it went in the ordinary
Channel. For Example;</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the Manufacture be a Piece of
Broad Cloth, and it is made in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> at
<HI>Warmin&s;ter,</HI> or thereabouts. The Clothier
when it is fini&s;hed, &s;ends it up by the Carrier
to <HI>London,</HI> to Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI>
Factor to be &s;old. Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the Factor, &s;ells
it to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Draper: Mr. <HI>B.</HI>
the Woollen-Draper, &s;ells it to Mr. <HI>C.</HI> Shop-Keeper
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and he cuts it out in
his Shop, and &s;ells it to <HI>D</HI>&mdash;<HI>E</HI>&mdash;E&s;&abque;
a Country Gentleman, and other Gentlemen
about him, to make them new Suits of
Cloaths, and &s;o they are the la&s;t Con&s;umers;
<PB N="112" REF="124">
al&s;o 'tis &s;ent down by the Carrier from <HI>Lon|don</HI>
to <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>NOW between the <HI>Wilt&s;hire</HI> Clothier and
the <HI>Northampton</HI> Shop-Keeper, here are no
le&s;s than four important Families of Trade&s;|men,
who get their Living, and, perhaps, in
Time grow rich by their Bu&s;ine&s;s, in the ne|gotiating,
as I may call it, this Piece of
Cloth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE Carrier from <HI>Warmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
his Pay comes to, perhaps, 5 <HI>s. per</HI>
Cloth, which is Two Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard
upon the Cloth at Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factor has
his Commi&s;&s;ion at two and a half
<HI>per Cent.</HI> which if this Cloth be &s;old
for fifteen Shillings a Yard, amounts
to Four Pence Half-Penny <HI>per</HI> Yard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Draper, &s;elling
it to Mr. <HI>C.</HI> the Shop-Keeper at <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI>
and giving him, perhaps, &s;ix
to nine Months Credit, he cannot afford
to get le&s;s than Nine Pence or a Shilling
<HI>per</HI> Yard by him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THE <HI>Northampton</HI> Carrier for Carriage,
mu&s;t have &s;omething, &s;uppo&s;e about
Three Half-Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard for Carriage,
all which amounts to One Shilling and
Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard Advance upon
the Cloth.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="113" REF="125">
BUT now here is Mr. <HI>F. G.</HI> another Shop-sKeeper
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and perhaps an
Alderman, a rich over-grown Trade&s;man;
and he having more Money than his Neigh|bours,
and wanting no Credit, but prying
about into all the Secrets of the Trade, he finds
out where the&s;e Cloths are made, and away goes
he to <HI>Warmin&s;ter</HI> directly; and there finding
out the Clothier, or perhaps two or three
Clothiers, he &s;ettles a Corre&s;pondence with
them, buys his Goods there, and has them
brought directly by Hor&s;e-Packs to <HI>Nor|thampton;</HI>
and perhaps paying Ready Mo|ney,
tempts the Clothier to &s;ell it him a
Penny <HI>per</HI> Yard cheaper too than his Factor
&s;old it at <HI>London</HI> to the Woollen-Draper.</P>
<P>BY this Means, the following Incidents
happen in Trade, and the following Advan|tages,
to the rich Shop-Keeper at <HI>Northamp|ton.</HI></P>
<P>1.
The Carriage from <HI>Warmin&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Nor|thampton</HI>
he mu&s;t pay, which being a little
farther than to <HI>London,</HI> and out of the ordi|nary
Road, may amount to Two Pence a
Yard upon the Cloth, but the Man buying,
perhaps, three or four Hor&s;e-Packs at a
Time, he has it carried cheap; and finding
Ways, perhaps, to load the Hor&s;es out with
Wool, &s;ill by the Strength of his great Stock
he makes his Advantage both Ways, and
gains &s;o much, that the Carriage of his
Wool and his Cloth co&s;ts him nothing, for
<PB N="114" REF="126">
he &s;ends the Clothier the Wool, and brings
the Cloth back.</P>
<P>THUS he has his Cloth Two Shillings and
Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard cheaper than his Neigh|bour
Shop-Keeper, and by &s;elling it &s;o much
cheaper to <HI>D. E.</HI> E&s;&abque; and others, he gets
all their Cu&s;tom from his poor Neighbour
Trade&s;man, who can &s;ell to no Body but
&s;uch People, as perhaps being in his Books,
mu&s;t buy of him, becau&s;e they owe him
Money.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all: For this Mr. <HI>F. G.</HI>
of <HI>Northampton,</HI> buying thus of the Clo|thier,
here is the Carrier of <HI>Warmin&s;ter</HI> &s;unk
out of Trade; he is &s;upplanted, and the Man
and his Hor&s;es put out of their Employment,
and the <HI>Northampton</HI> Carrier likewi&s;e. Mr. <HI>A.</HI>
the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factor, al&s;o lo&s;es his Em|ploy,
aud may &s;it and blow his Fingers for
want of Trade. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Dra|per,
lo&s;e shis Trade too, and he having a great
Family, and &s;itting at a high Rent, is ruin'd
by the Lo&s;s of his whole&s;ale Trade, &s;o he runs
out, breaks, and is undone. Thus the Channel
of Trade is turn'd, the Stream is cut off, and all
the Families that were before employ'd (be|tween
them) are cut out of their Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and turn'd loo&s;e in the World to get their
Bread &s;ome other Way, or perhaps want it.</P>
<P>AND what's all the Benefit which is made by
this Spoil upon Trade? only this, That 'Squire
<HI>D&mdash;E&mdash;</HI> of <HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> buys his
<PB N="115" REF="127">
Suits of Cloths half a Crown a Yard cheap|er;
which is of no great Concern to him, nor
does he value it, or is it of any moment in
Proportion to the Wounds which Trade re|ceives
by it, in all the Particulars mentioned
above.</P>
<P>THIS is cutting off the Circulation of Trade;
this is managing Trade with a few Hands;
and if this Practi&s;e, which is indeed evident|ly
begun, was come to be univer&s;al, a Mil|lion
of People in <HI>England</HI> that now live
handfomely by Trade, would be de&s;titute of
Employment, and their Families in Time
might want Bread.</P>
<P>NOR in Conclu&s;ion, would the Gentlemen
or la&s;t Con&s;umers be better'd by it all; for
this Want of Employment, would in the
End, drive away the People, and the Mouths
would be wanting for the Bread, as well as
the Bread for the Mouths; the Growth of the
Land not being con&s;umed, the Rents mu&s;t
fall of Cour&s;e, and &s;o the Mi&s;chief would
circulate, as the Trade &s;hould have done.
Certainly the Gentlemen find their Intere&s;t in
the Dearne&s;s of the Manufacture, if it may
be call'd Dearne&s;s, whether they will &s;ee it,
or no; 'tis highly their Advantage to have
Multitudes of People upon their Lands, and
nothing can keep the People together like
&s;omething that can find them Employment.</P>
<P>THERE is another Fundamental in the Pro&s;|perity
of a Nation, which will never fail to
<PB N="116" REF="128">
be true, <HI>viz.</HI> that no Land is fully improv'd,
'till it is made to yield its utmo&s;t Increa&s;e:
But if our Lands &s;hould be made to
yield their utmo&s;t Increa&s;e, and your
People cannot con&s;ume the Increa&s;e, or fo|reign
Trade take it off your Hands, 'tis
then no Increa&s;e to us, and mu&s;t not be pro|duced;
&s;o that the Lands mu&s;t be laid down,
that is to &s;ay, a certain Proportion of them,
and left to bear no Corn, or feed no Cattle,
becau&s;e your Produce is too great for your
Con&s;umption.</P>
<P>HENCE 'tis a certain and unque&s;tioned Bene|fit
to a Nation to increa&s;e the Number of Peo|ple,
that they may con&s;ume the Product of the
Land. But then take it with you as you go,
that this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be an Increa&s;e of &s;uch
People as can not only con&s;ume the Provi&s;ions,
but can pay for them too; for an Increa&s;e of
Beggars is no Increa&s;e at all in Sen&s;e of Trade.</P>
<P>AND how &s;hall the Numbers of &s;uch Peo|ple
be increas'd, but by finding Employment
for them? Let any Experiment of this kind
be referr'd to, let any Man erect a Manufacture
in a Village, where there are but few Inha|bitants;
if that Manufature goes on, and
there are Wages to be paid con&s;tant, and
Work to be had, there will &s;oon be People:
Where Bu&s;ine&s;s leads, the People always
follow. If People did not come in imme|diately,
being kept out by Pari&s;h Laws,
they would &s;oon increa&s;e by tho&s;e who had
<PB N="117" REF="129">
or could obtain legal Settlements, &s;taying all
at home; whereas where there is no con|&s;tant
Employment, the People &s;catter and
di&s;per&s;e, and &s;eek Settlements where they
can get Employment.</P>
<P>THUS you &s;ee wherever there are Manu|facture,
there are always Crowds of People;
the Towns grow populous, and are throng'd
with working Poor till they grow rich, and,
as it were, innumerable. Thus it is in the
We&s;t Riding of <HI>York&s;hire;</HI> thus in <HI>Norfolk,</HI>
about <HI>Norwich,</HI> and the Country round; at
<HI>Exeter,</HI> and all over the County of <HI>Devon;</HI>
and the like in other Parts: Wherever the
Trade is, there are the People.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;equence of this, is, that where
the&s;e populous Towns are, the Country can|not
produce enough to feed them; but they
buy the Provi&s;ions from the neighbouring
Provinces or Counties.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, where there are no Ma|nufactures,
there's no Employ for the People;
where the Inhabitants are, only Landlord
and Tenant, there the People cannot con|&s;ume
the Product of the Earth; and did
not the next or neighbouring Counties take
off their Corn and Cattle, the poor Far|mers
and Tenants would not know what to
do with them, or how to pay their Rent.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is the Support of the whole
Community, employs the People, keeps them
at home, and in Throngs together, by which
<PB N="118" REF="130">
the Produce of the Country is con&s;um'd, which
is the Life of the whole Country. It is cer|tain,
that were it not for Trade, the People
of <HI>England</HI> would not be able to con&s;ume the
Provi&s;ions which the Land produces; and
even as it is, they could not do it, were it
not that great Quantities of Corn are every
Year exported into foreign Countries:
Should a large and good Crop, and a &s;ea|&s;onable
Harve&s;t come in, and no Demand
for Corn come from abroad, 'tis hard to ex|pre&s;s
what our Ca&s;e in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be;
and though 'tis an Expre&s;&s;ion which may at
fir&s;t Sight appear &s;trange, yet it is actually
&s;o, we &s;hould be curs'd with Plenty.</P>
<P>THERE was a Time, when this was more
&s;en&s;ibly felt in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps than in
mo&s;t Part of <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> in the Year 1680.
to the Revolution, a &s;mall Interval of one
Piece of a Year of Drought excepted. There
was during tho&s;e Years, an uninterrupted
Series of Plenty, not in <HI>England</HI> only, but
in all the neighbouring Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
&s;o that we had not only a great Plenty at
Home, but no Demand from abroad.</P>
<P>THE Con&s;equence of this was, that the
be&s;t Wheat was &s;old at the great Markets
near <HI>London,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Farnham, Dartford,
Hem&s;ted, Hertford, Hitchin,</HI> and other
known Markets, at from Sixteen to Eighteen
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter; and farther off, as in
<HI>Northampton&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Bedford&s;hire, Hamp|&s;hire.
<PB N="119" REF="131">
Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and Places of the like Di&s;tance,
at Thirteen to Fourteen <HI>per</HI> Quarter.</P>
<P>AND as this Cheapne&s;s held for &s;o many
Years, what was the Con&s;equence of it?
Truly this, That all the Farmers in <HI>England,</HI>
generally &s;peaking, were in a &s;inking Con|dition;
many broke and blew up every
Year; and it was impo&s;&s;ible that tho&s;e who
depended upon nothing but their Labour,
and the Crop, could pay the Rent. I remem|ber
to have &s;een a Farmer who had twenty
Acres of good Wheat, a fair and flouri&s;hing
Crop, yet when it came to Market, it would
not pay for the Seed, the Husbandry, the
Harve&s;ting, and Thre&s;hing, and Carriage
to Market, all the Rent of the Land &s;unk,
and to be paid out of his dead Stock.</P>
<P>NOR was the Goodne&s;s of the Crop any
Advantage to the poor Farmer; but the
more Corn the more Charge of Reaping,
Hou&s;ing, Thre&s;hing, Cleaning, and Carry|ing
to Market; and where the Price was &s;o
&s;mall, it could ill pay tho&s;e Charges, except
that oftentimes the poor Man did mo&s;t of
that Work him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HAD this continued till now, mo&s;t of the Far|mers
all over <HI>England</HI> had been Beggars;
the Farms would in mo&s;t Places have been
thrown up, and the Landlords mu&s;t have
turn'd Plowmen, or, which is what I men|tioned
above, the Rent of Lands mu&s;t have
&s;unk extremely low, which is, in &s;hort,
<PB N="120" REF="132">
&s;inking the Fee-Simple, and reducing the
E&s;tates of the Gentry all over the Nation.</P>
<P>THOSE that enter into the&s;e Particulars,
may, with me, make this u&s;eful Ob&s;erva|tion,
namely, that 'tis Trade alone that can
remedy this Evil: Employing Numbers of
People &s;ecures the Con&s;umption of the Pro|duce,
and that keeps up the Price, and by
con&s;equence the Rate of the Lands: This
keeping up the Price of the Produce, enables
the Farmer to pay his Rent. If our Manu|factures
were &s;o increas'd by Trade, that
they could maintain more People than the
Land could feed, and that, <HI>as the</HI> Dutch <HI>do
at this Time,</HI> we were obliged to fetch all
our Corn, or great Part of it from abroad,
it would mo&s;t certainly be an Advantage to
the Publick, and the Rent of Lands would
ri&s;e in Proportion.</P>
<P>IT would be a long and u&s;eful Di&s;cour&s;e,
if I could digre&s;s to it, to &s;hew how great
and real an Advantage keeping up the Rent
is to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation;
all your Taxes are rated upon it, your Pro|portions
form'd from it, your Militia rai&s;ed
by it, your Poor's Rates and Surveyors
Rates, and every other Thing of Pari&s;h Pro|portion
taxed by it.</P>
<P>THE more the Rate of Lands, the more
your Land-Tax pays to the Publick, and
yet without Lo&s;s to the Landlord, but on
the contrary, greatly to his Gain; and the
<PB N="121" REF="133">
more the Land-Tax brings in, the le&s;s Need
of Levies by other <HI>Ways and Means;</HI> the
more your Land-Tax rai&s;es, the more the
Strength of the Nation is tried, the Go|vernment
is enabled to rai&s;e the more Forces.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as the rai&s;ing the Rents and
Rates of Lands is an Addition to the Strength
of the Nation, &s;o the increa&s;ing the Num|ber
of People, that is to &s;ay, of &s;uch Peo|ple
as are able to work and maintain them|&s;elves,
&s;till increa&s;es the Strength; for the
more Hands the more Strength, and the
more Mouths the more Wealth; becau&s;e
every Mouth helps to con&s;ume the Growth,
&s;uppo&s;ing the Hands &s;till to pay for what
the Mouth con&s;umes; for you mu&s;t always
take it with you, that Multitudes of Alms|taking
Poor, Numbers of Beggars do nothing.</P>
<P>THIS would be a Digre&s;&s;ion, if I was to
go on with it: But as it &s;tops here, and is
turn'd &s;hort upon the Subject in hand, it is
extremely to the Purpo&s;e, thus, <HI>viz.</HI> that
all this is done by Trade, and by Trade
only.</P>
<P>TRADE maintains Multitudes, and in|crea&s;es
them by the Con&s;equence of their
Labour.</P>
<P>TRADE rai&s;es Towns, Cities, and popu|lous
Villages, by bringing the People toge|ther
to particular Places, where the Com|merce
fixes, and where the Manufactures
are fix'd.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="134">
TRADE employs the People, and pays
them Wages for their Labour.</P>
<P>TRADE increa&s;es by tho&s;e People con|&s;uming
and wearing the Manufactures they
make, as well as the Provi&s;ions they buy.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is a publick Benefit; and, in
a word, the Wealth of Families, the Rates
of Lands, and the Strength of the Nation
depend all upon Trade.</P>
<P>AS Trade then is a publick Benefit, the
Trade&s;men are a publick Ble&s;&s;ing; for they
are the Men that carry it on; or, as I ob&s;erv'd
before, may very well be &s;aid to DRIVE the
Trade; they manage it, they keep it up to
its Rules and Regulations; they keep up
the Value of the Manufacture, and the Re|putation
of the Manufacturer; for 'tis plain
the Credit of the Manufacturer is maintain'd
by the Goodne&s;s of his Manufacture.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall ju&s;t mention it, though
I &s;hall &s;peak more largely to it el&s;ewhere:
It is not always the Intere&s;t of Trade to
have the Manufacture be brought down to
a low Price, e&s;pecially if the Goodne&s;s of
the Goods &s;inks with the Rate: But to keep
up the Manufacture to its Goodne&s;s, though
the Price be higher than its Neighbours, is
a Credit to the Manufacture, and to the
Nation that make them, let them come from
what Part of the World they will.</P>
<P>IT was urg'd by &s;ome, who &s;ugge&s;ted that
our Manufacture of Broad Cloth will be out
<PB N="123" REF="135">
done by the <HI>French,</HI> that we &s;hall lo&s;e our
<HI>Turky</HI> Trade, the <HI>French</HI> &s;elling their
Cloaths cheaper at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and at <HI>Aleppo</HI>
than the <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> and that becau&s;e Cheapne&s;s
always cau&s;es Con&s;umption, and the <HI>French</HI>
Cloths were cheaper, therefore we &s;hould
not &s;ell our Cloths till all the <HI>French</HI> were
gone.</P>
<P>BUT Experience has prov'd the contrary;
the <HI>French</HI> Cloths feel as fine, look as well,
the Colours are dyed as good, the Cloth|workers
Part was perform'd as well, for the
Cloths were well dre&s;s'd; in a word, they
look'd every Way as good, and perhaps at fir&s;t
had &s;ome Advantage, and went well off.</P>
<P>BUT when they came to wear, the Con|&s;umer
pre&s;ently found the Advantage; as the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth weighed twenty to thirty, to for|ty
Pound a Bale more than the <HI>French</HI> at the
Scale; &s;o in the wearing there was no Compa|ri&s;on:
The <HI>French</HI> wore like Druggets, rough
and woolly; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> like Velvet, &s;mooth
and &s;olid: The <HI>French</HI> wore $appy and coar&s;e,
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> wore &s;oft and fine: The <HI>French</HI>
wore into Rags, and wore out; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
wore firm and la&s;ting, even to the Thread:
And what followed, the Con&s;equence was
plain.</P>
<P><Q><P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth obtain'd Credit, and
increa&s;ed it by its real Worth.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="136">
THE <HI>French</HI> Cloth lo&s;t its Credit, and
declined by the Value appearing to lo&s;e:
And what follow'd?</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth, though dearer, went
always off, and was &s;old fir&s;t.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Cloth, though cheaper, lay
on hand, and would &s;eldom &s;ell while
there was any <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cloth to be
had.</P></Q>
SO that it is not always that a lower priced
Manufacture goes be&s;t off.</P>
<P>THERE is a great Difference between dear
and high-priced, or cheap and low-priced;
Goods may be high-priced, and not dear,
low-priced, and not cheap; the Rates of all
Goods are to be mea&s;ur'd by their Good|ne&s;s
or Badne&s;s; and 'tis therefore the Inte|re&s;t
of Trade&s;men to keep up the Goodne&s;s
and Value of their Goods, and then the
Price, though higher than others, may be
lower in Proportion: But of this al&s;o I may
&s;peak more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>IT is, however, to the Purpo&s;e here, thus,
<HI>viz.</HI> That to keep up the Goodne&s;s of a
Manufacture is not only the way to keep
up its Rate at Market, but by that to keep
up the Wages of the Workmen; and it is of
the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence to keep up the Rate
of the Wages of the Poor, if it can be done,
upon many Accounts too long to dwell upon
here.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="137">
BY the Height of Wages the Rate of all
Things are &s;upported; the Price of Provi|&s;ions
are in the fir&s;t Place maintain'd by it;
by the Price of Provi&s;ions the Rent of Lands
are kept up, and by the Rent of Lands the
E&s;tates of the Nobility and Gentry, and the
whole landed Intere&s;t are &s;upported, and
the publick Stock of the Nation kept up,
and improved as above.</P>
<P>UPON this Account, and from the whole
of what has been &s;aid, it appears, that 'tis
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the Rate of
our Manufactures to as good a Price as the
Rea&s;on of the Thing will allow: When I
&s;ay it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, I mean it is &s;o
in the Language of Trade; it is ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the Pro&s;perity of Trade,
and therefore let none trouble us or them|&s;elves
with the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary Cavil at the
Words ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; if they do,
we &s;hall di&s;regard it: 'Tis the Thing, not
the Words that we are laying the Weight
upon; and I mu&s;t be under&s;tood to &s;peak
in the Language of Trade, which is the Sub|ject
I am &s;peaking of, and I make the&s;e
Cautions here once for all, that I may not
trouble my&s;elf or the Reader any more with
&s;uch Critici&s;ms in the Reading.</P>
<Q><P>1. IT may be &s;aid in the Language of
Trade, that a Man <HI>cannot do</HI> a Thing
which he cannot do to his Gain; a
<PB N="126" REF="138">
Trade&s;man cannot &s;ell his Goods at
&s;uch a Price, that is to &s;ay, he cannot
to &s;ave or gain by them: He has Goods
in his Hands to di&s;po&s;e of for a Manu|facturer,
or for any Employer, and he
writes him word he cannot &s;ell them,
that is, he cannot &s;ell them but to Lo&s;s,
or at the Price he is limited to.</P>
<P>HE is to &s;end Goods to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but he
cannot &s;end them by &s;uch a Carrier,
that is, he cannot &s;end them &s;o cheap
as he can by &s;uch another.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man leaves off a particular
Trade or Trading to a particular Place;
why he an&s;wers, he can trade in &s;uch
Goods no longer, or he cannot trade to
&s;uch a Place any more; the Rea&s;on is,
he cannot do it without Lo&s;s.</P>
<P>HE cannot trade in &s;uch Goods, for he
can get nothing by them.</P>
<P>SUCH and &s;uch People can &s;upply &s;uch a
Market cheaper than he can afford it,
they living near to the Place, and for
that Rea&s;on he can trade there no lon|ger.</P>
<P>THAT cannot be done in Trade which
cannot be done to Advantage; for Gain
is the End of Commerce to the Mer|chant,
as Supply of Nece&s;&s;aries is the
End of it to the Con&s;umer.</P>
<P>2. THAT Thing is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
a Trade, which it is not to be carried
<PB N="127" REF="139">
on profitably without: For Example,
Ships, Seamen, and the Water are ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary for carrying on the
Coal-Trade from <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> to <HI>London;</HI>
the Water is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the
Ships, the Ships ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary
to the Seamen, and all of them ab&s;o|lutely
nece&s;&s;ary to the Trade; becau&s;e
the Coals could not be &s;old without the
Market, the Market not &s;upplied with|out
Ships to carry them, the Ships could
not float without the Water, the Water
could not guide them without the Sai|lors
and Pilots.</P>
<P>SHIPS are nece&s;&s;ary to the Coal-Trade
as Food is nece&s;&s;ary to Life: In like
Ca&s;es, therefore, when I &s;ay in Matters
of Trade &s;uch or &s;uch Things are ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary, I am to be under|&s;tood
that they are &s;o when they are
nece&s;&s;ary to the Pro&s;perity of Trade.</P></Q>
<P>HAVING thus enter'd tho&s;e preliminary
Cautions, as I &s;aid, once for all, I return
to the Subject where I left off, namely, that
it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in Trade to keep up
our Manufacture to as good a Price, that is,
to as high a Rate as the Nature and Rea&s;on
of the Thing will allow; the Rea&s;ons are
plain, becau&s;e, as the Manufactures &s;ink in
Price, Wages abate to the Poor, Provi&s;ions
mu&s;t abate in the Market, and Rents mu&s;t
<PB N="128" REF="140">
&s;ink, and abate to the Landlords, Taxes and
Pound-Rates &s;ink to the Publick, and the
whole Stock of the Nation abates in
its Value. I&s;hall explain this in the next
Chapter, and di&s;tingui&s;h it from &s;everal ex|ceptionable
Ca&s;es.</P>

not by Engro&s;&s;ings, Combinations, and other
illegal Practices in Trade, oppre&s;s and

<P>_NOthing is more frequent among
Trade&s;men than to &s;upplant and
underwork one another in their
Bu&s;ine&s;s, by &s;inking or abating the
Value or Price of the Goods they &s;ell, that
is, in a word, to <HI>under-&s;ell</HI> one another, to
carry away the Trade.</P>
<P>THIS is a Thing &s;o big with Mi&s;chiefs, &s;o
complicated in trading Craft, and the Particu|lars
&s;o little known or con&s;idered by the Peo|ple
that go that Way to work, that I doubt
not the hone&s;t Trade&s;man will be thankful
to be let into the Con&s;equences of it, and
at lea&s;t to &s;ee how it affects him: But fir&s;t,
<PB N="129" REF="141">
I mu&s;t &s;tate the Ca&s;e, and enquire into the
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>THERE are two or three Sorts of Trade&s;|men
that under&s;el their Goods:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. YOUNG Trade&s;men, newly &s;et up;
and they do it to get a Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. RICH old Trade&s;men, who have over-grown
Stocks; and they do it to keep
their Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Poor Trade&s;men, who are obliged to
&s;ell to rai&s;e Money.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> YOUNG Trade&s;men, newly &s;et up,
and who think by &s;elling cheap they &s;hall
get a Trade, and bring Cu&s;tom to their Shop:
It is true the Pretence is &s;pecious and fair;
but the Thing in it&s;elf is foul and unfair,
and in the End is ruinous to the Trade and
to the Trade&s;man al&s;o.</P>
<Q><P>1. IT is a Fraud in ic&s;elf; for 'tis only
deceiving the Cu&s;tomers you invite,
who you draw in to come to your Shop,
per&s;wading them to believe they &s;hall
always buy cheaper of you than of
other People; whereas your Defign is
to make your&s;elf Amends upon them
afterwards, and at lea&s;t not to continue to
&s;ellthem &s;o cheap for a Con&s;tancy, as they
call it. Thus I knew, or perhaps I might
&s;ay know, a certain Shop-Keeper that,
<PB N="130" REF="142">
to invite a Lady to his Shop, promi&s;ed
to &s;ell her con&s;iderably cheaper than
&s;he &s;hould buy any where el&s;e in <HI>Lon|don;</HI>
and accordingly &s;urpriz'd her by
&s;elling her a Suit of Cloaths near two
Shillings a Yard cheaper, than he &s;old
the &s;ame Silk to another Lady before
her Face.</P>
<P>IT was hardly po&s;&s;ible but that finding
her&s;elf &s;o kindly us'd, &s;he &s;hould go
again to his Shop, and not only go
her&s;elf, but carry her Friends there too:
But the Trade&s;man, who kept his Account
very well in his Head, did not forget
to make him&s;elf Satisfaction in his next
Bargain for the Lo&s;s in his &s;i&s;t, and
&s;he paid &s;ufficiently for it in what &s;he
bought next, not in the Price, &s;o much
as in the Goodne&s;s of what &s;he bought.
If it is objected, that then &s;he need not
have bought; I an&s;wer, that is no &s;uf|ficient
Objection, becau&s;e 'tis to be &s;up|po&s;ed
that the Lady, by being &s;o ex|ceedingly
well u&s;ed at fir&s;t, might, no
que&s;tion, come into the Shop prepo&s;|&s;e&s;s'd
a little in the Mercer's Favour,
and with a Belief, that he would u&s;e her
well at lea&s;t, though perhaps he could
not u&s;e her &s;o very well as he did
before. One is apt to &s;peak well of the
Bridge that carries us well over, and
<PB N="131" REF="143">
to expect good Pennyworths To-day,
where we had &s;uch good U&s;age Ye&s;ter|day;
and &s;o the Party is at lea&s;t the
ea&s;ier to to be cheated.</P>
<P>BUT in the next Place, it is not &s;o ea&s;y for a
Cu&s;tomer to avoid being cheated in the
Goods, as it may be to avoid being im|po&s;ed
upon in the Price. The Price is
generally a little known, or with|in
a little to be gue&s;&s;ed at; but the
Goodne&s;s of the Goods are not &s;o ea&s;i|ly,
at lea&s;t not &s;o nicely judg'd of
or di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Buyer; their
Judgment cannot be &s;o good as the
Trade&s;man's, who knows the Making
of them, and perhaps might him&s;elf fur|ni&s;h
the Materials; He is capable of
&s;ome certain Frauds in that Part, which
it is impo&s;&s;ible for the Buyer to know,
or at lea&s;t to di&s;cover, till the Wear|ing,
and till the Experience comes to
bear Witne&s;s for them; and then the
Trade&s;man never fails to put it off by
&s;aying he is very &s;orry for it, that he
thought it an extraordinary Piece, and
by adding a more fatal Wheedle, <HI>viz.</HI>
that he will make you Amends when
you plea&s;e to want any Thing el&s;e;
and when the Lady comes again, he
does do it perhaps a little, to carry on
the Bite, and &s;o alternately cheats her
and abates, and abates and cheats her
<PB N="132" REF="144">
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively, till one Time with another
he makes him&s;elf even with her, and
makes her even with him too; Thus he
&s;ecures her Cu&s;tom, and has her fa&s;t to
his Shop; after which &s;he is like other
Cu&s;tomers to him, and they deal as
well as they can together.</P></Q>
<P>THIS is a Piece of Shop-Keeping Craft,
and there's no great Matter in it; no more
indeed is there in the young Shop-Keeper's
&s;elling cheap at his fir&s;t Opening; it is his
Intere&s;t, and the Buyer is even with him in
the Trick of it; for as they &s;ay, Every one
has a Penny for a new Shop: The Rea&s;on is
this; People always think the new Shop|keeper
will &s;ell cheaper than ordinary, to
oblige and get Trade, and &s;o they go there
to have (as they call it) &s;ome of his good
Pennyworths, though perhaps they never
intend to come again. So the Shop-Keeper
&s;ells cheaper than his Neighbours, to engage
them to his Shop, though he never de&s;igns
to u&s;e them &s;o again, but, like the Mer|cer,
to make him&s;elf even with them when
they are become Cu&s;tomers to his Shop.</P>
<P>AND thus the Cu&s;tomers bite the Shop|keeper,
by telling him that they intend to
be con&s;tant to his Shop, if he &s;ells them
cheap; that is to &s;ay, if he will &s;ell his
Goods cheaper than he can afford, they will
come and buy, and help to ruin him. On the
<PB N="133" REF="145">
other hand, he tells them, that he does &s;ell
them cheaper than he can afford, in hopes
to engage them to the Shop, that is to &s;ay,
in hopes he may have an Opportunity to
pick their Pockets another Time; &s;o they go
on, according to a Piece of modern <HI>Latin,</HI>
(if you plea&s;e to accept of it) of my rude
making, <HI>Qui &s;harpat &s;harpabitur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> BUT to leave this little petty Fraud
of Under&s;elling to get a Trade, which is only
le&s;s hurtful than others, becau&s;e it goes a
le&s;s Way, and is but of a &s;hort Continu|ance:
There is another that is more fatal in
its Con&s;equence, and that as it is of a greater
Magnitude; and this is when the rich over-grown
Tradefman under&s;els to keep his
Trade, to prevent young Beginners &s;etting
up by him, and to break others that are al|ready
trading within his Reach. And this is
fatal many Ways:
<Q><P>1. TIS fatal to the poorer and little Dea|lers
about him; for they &s;tand &s;till,
with their Fingers in their Mouths, as
we call it, or walk about at their Shop
Doors, and have nothing to do, while
they &s;ee all the Trade run in the great
Channel of their neighbouring Alder|man's
Shop; who gives large Credit at
a Ready-Money Price, or &s;ells for Rea|dy
Money Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than
<PB N="134" REF="146">
they can; &s;o that they are undone of
Cour&s;e, have a high Rent to pay, and
no Trade, and the great over-grown
Dealer gets all the Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>2. BUT this is not all: This over-grown
Dealer out-buys them too; for being,
as is noted, full of Money, he watches
all po&s;&s;ible Advantages of Buying; lies
ready when a poor Manufacturer has
a great Stock of Goods on his Hands,
and cannot &s;ell them, or wants Money,
and perhaps mu&s;t &s;ell them; and then
he buys at an Under-Price, and by
oppre&s;&s;ing the Maker, on one hand,
he makes him able to oppre&s;s his Neigh|bour
Shop-Keepers on the other; for he
that underbuys, can be &s;ure to under&s;el.</P></Q></P>
<P>NOR is this all; the Mi&s;chief does not
end here: He is not content to run down
the poor Trade&s;man that lives near him by
under&s;elling, and oppre&s;&s;ing here and there
a Manufacturer by hard buying, but he does
the &s;ame in its kind by all the Manufacturers
who he employs; for he will buy nothing
but with the utmoft grinding, and &s;crewing;
Beating them down to the lowe&s;t Pitch of li|ving,
and even below living; till they are &s;o
far from letting a Trade&s;man or Workman
live under them, that, as a poor Clothier
&s;aid to Sir&mdash;, a known hard Buyer in
<PB N="135" REF="147">
the City, he will hardly give them leave
to &s;tarve under him.</P>
<P>NOW, as the Con&s;equence of this goes
farther than what I was &s;peaking of before,
&s;o it is more fatal; for,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THIS Method is not only fatal to
the poor Clothier, but, in a word, 'tis fatal to
the Clothing, 'tis injurious to the Trade
it&s;elf, and ruins not the Clothier, but the
Nation; the whole Country feels the Blow,
like an Earthquake, which does not &s;hake
this or that particular Town or Village only,
but gives a Shock to the whole Country.
For Example,</P>
<P>THE Clothier having &s;old this great
Merchant a large Quantity of Goods very
low, and engaging with him to &s;upply him
all the Year in proportion to the &s;ame Price;
the fir&s;t Effect of this is, that the Merchant
ca&s;ts off all the Clothiers who he dealt with
before, or at lea&s;t tho&s;e who made that Sort of
Goods before, unle&s;s they will &s;ell at the
&s;ame Price, which he makes to be perhaps
five or ten Shillings upon a Cloth lower than
formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> OTHER Merchants in <HI>London,</HI>
who are Buyers of the &s;ame Goods, (&s;up|po&s;ing
they do not at fir&s;t know the parti|cular
Ca&s;e or Rea&s;on of it,) finding an
Alteration, that the Clothiers hang about
them, and that they cannot &s;ell their Goods, and
that the Hall or the Factors Warehou&s;es are
<PB N="136" REF="148">
full of Goods, piled up, as is &s;ometimes the
Ca&s;e: The Merchants, I &s;ay, &s;eeing the Clo|thiers
importuning them for a Market, fail
not to make their Advantage, and to &s;crew
them down to an Abatement, and the Clo|thier
rather than not &s;ell, and wanting Money
too to pay their Spinners and Workfolks in
the Country, are forc'd to comply; and thus
by degrees the Goods are &s;unk at Market:
For Example; &s;uppo&s;e,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The white Cloths made at <HI>Cirence&s;ter</HI>
u&s;ually &s;old at Six Pound <HI>per</HI> Piece Rea|dy
Money, are now brought down to
Five Pound Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Piece,
three Months or &s;ix Months Credit, and
to Five Pound Ready Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. FINE <HI>Medley</HI> Cloths of <HI>Trowbridge</HI> or
<HI>Warmin&s;ter,</HI> at Fourteen or Fifteen Shil|lings
<HI>per</HI> Yard, brought down by the &s;ame
Rule to Thirteen or Fourteen Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Yard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. DU-Roys of <HI>Taunton</HI> and the Towns
round it, from Twenty Seven Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Piece, to Twenty Four Shillings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. FINE Druggets of <HI>Devizes,</HI> or of
<HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> from Eighteen Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard,
Fifteen Pence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Shaloons of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> or of the We&s;t
Country, in Proportion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND thus indeed of all the &s;everal
Woollen Manufactures of one kind or ano|ther
<PB N="137" REF="149">
throughout <HI>England;</HI> for the Ca&s;e is
the &s;ame in one Thing as in another, from
this over-rich Buyer running down the poor
Clothiers, and driving them away to &s;eek
a Market; they on the other hand are &s;ent
hawking about to other Merchants or Buyers,
or forc'd to borrow Money of the Factor,
which is the &s;ame Thing; (for at la&s;t he un|der&s;els
their Goods to pay him&s;elf,) and thus
at length all the Buyers &s;eeing a Glut of
Goods, run down the Price, and the whole
Market &s;inks upon their Hands.</P>
<P>THIS is one Step to Ruin.</P>
<P>BUT it does not end here; for the Clo|thier
pinch'd in Price, and not able to live
at the Rate he is now oblig'd to &s;ell at,
comes down into the Country, and the fir&s;t
Thing he does is, to &s;lack his Hand in Quan|tity,
and make le&s;s; The Con&s;equence
of this is, that he di&s;mi&s;&s;es &s;o many Looms,
and turns off &s;o many Spinners; &s;o there
in the fir&s;t Place the Employment of the
Poor is &s;horten'd, and the Trade in general
is abated.</P>
<P>THE poor Weavers and Spinners go to
&s;eek other Ma&s;ters; but by this Time the
re&s;t of the Clothiers finding the Market &s;ink
as above, are in the &s;ame Condition, and they
won't take on more Workfolk, when, as it
happens, they had rather too many before,
and in a little while they are fain to do ju&s;t
the &s;ame Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> turn off their Weavers
and Spinners too.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="150">
THE Poor being thus pinch'd, have the&s;e
&s;everal Recour&s;es.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To Abatement,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To Charity,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Fly from their Mi&s;ery,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Go to Jail.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THUS the Ruin reaches the Labourer; for
as it is with the Ma&s;ter, &s;o it mu&s;t be with
the Servant.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> TO Abatement of Price: As it was
with the Clothier, rather work &s;tarvingly
than not work at all; rather pinch than pe|ri&s;h;
the Wages abate, and the Poor &s;uffer:
As their Pay &s;inks, they are obliged to pinch,
fare hard, feed coar&s;e, be cloath'd in Rags,
and the like: And what follows this? the
Price of Provi&s;ions mu&s;t follow the Price
of Wages; for as the Poor have Money, or
not Money, &s;o they mu&s;t buy, or not buy
in the Market: 'Tis true they mu&s;t not,
they cannot &s;tarve; but they mu&s;t abate,
and feed as (I &s;ay) coar&s;e, and fare harder;
and by this Means Provi&s;ions, which for|merly
went off well, come back from the
Market un&s;old: The Butcher, which kill'd
three Sheep for a Market-Day, kills but
two; and others, that killed a Bullock
for a Market-Day in the Country, perhaps,
kill a Bullock between three or four of
them.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="151">
THUS abating the Labour of the Poor,
and &s;inking their Wages, affects the Markets,
and the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions abates;
but I mu&s;t go thro' the re&s;t of the Articles
too, for they all end at the &s;ame Point.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> WANT of Work oppre&s;&s;ing the
labouring Poor, they fly from their Mi&s;ery;
(like <HI>Hagar,</HI> that could not &s;ee the Death of
the Child,) they run away: A poor Man
cannot &s;ee his Wife and Children &s;tarve;
if he could work and relieve them, he would
&s;tay, and be willing to labour with all his
Heart; but his Ma&s;ter the Clothier, who
employ'd him, has put him off, has no Work
for him; and he has tried all the other Ma&s;|ters
in the Town, and the Ca&s;e is the &s;ame;
they have all more Workmen than they can
employ, for the Market declines; or if they
would employ them, they mu&s;t abate their
Wages; &s;o that with his utmo&s;t Labour he
can but ju&s;t keep him&s;elf from &s;tarving, not
being able to get any Thing for a Wife and
three, four, or five poor Children; and
this makes the Man di&s;tracted: He cannot
feed them; He cannot bear to hear them
cry for Bread, and have none to give them.
Indeed, who could? So the Man runs away
in De&s;pair, li&s;ts for a Soldier, goes to Sea,
or any Thing but &s;tarve, and the Con&s;e|quence
is this:
<Q><PB N="140" REF="152">
<P>1. THE Market, as I &s;aid before, is &s;o
much le&s;&s;en'd, as the Provi&s;ion that
Man eat before amounted to; that's a
plain Ca&s;e;. and if this &s;hould be, or
&s;uppo&s;e this to be but a hundred or
two hundred in a whole County, &s;uch
as <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> which is a manfacturing Coun|ty;
and if it goes on, it may be many
hundred; the Con&s;umption of Provi|&s;ions
in that County &s;inks in Proportion,
and the Effect of that I am to &s;peak
to by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>2. BUT if this Man can po&s;&s;ibly get a little
Work, he will; and rather than &s;ee his
Family peri&s;h, as above, he gets in where
he can, though he &s;upplants another;
and that he obtains by offering to work
cheaper; and &s;o another Family is turn|ed
out of Work; then the Weaver of
that other Family, rather than &s;tarve
too, does the &s;ame; and thus the Men,
it may be, keep their Work, but &s;ink
their Pay; and as this is, more or le&s;s,
&s;o the poor Family is more or le&s;s
di&s;tre&s;s'd, and are oblig'd to fare the
harder, and buy the le&s;s or the wor&s;e
Provi&s;ions in the Market; &s;o the Effect
is the &s;ame; and be&s;ides which, this
brings on the third Article, <HI>viz.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> CHARITY. If the Man is not able
to maintain his Family, the Pari&s;h mu&s;t:
<PB N="141" REF="153">
Perhaps the Wages he gain'd before was but
ju&s;t enough: One Pair of Hands to work, and
three or four Pair of Mouths to feed, &s;even or
eight Backs to cloath, with Hou&s;e-Rent and
Fire, what can the poor Man do? he had
ju&s;t enough to do before, and now his
Wages are abated, perhaps, &s;o much upon a
Piece, as may amount to two, or three, or
four Shillings a Week upon his Labour,
and in proportion as much upon the Spin|ning,
which was his Wife's Labour; and
this brings the Family into Di&s;tre&s;s, and they
have nothing to do but to make their Ca&s;e
known to the Pari&s;h, and they mu&s;t relieve
them: This is, in ca&s;e, the poor Man &s;tays,
and works under an Abatement of Wages.</P>
<P>BUT if the Man, not able to &s;tay to &s;ee
the Mi&s;ery of his Family, runs away, li&s;ts
into the Army, or goes to Sea: Then the
Wife and Children comes to the Pari&s;h whol|ly,
and lie upon them, not to help, but to
keep; and the Con&s;equence of this al&s;o I
mu&s;t &s;peak to by it&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> BUT there is yet another Shift;
and this is the &s;ame in its Con&s;equences eve|ry
Way, but rather more mi&s;erable to the
Family: The poor Man, not able to maintain
his Family by his Labour, now the Price or
Wages of his Work is &s;unk and abated, &s;hifts
as long as ever he can, goes on Tru&s;t at the
<PB N="142" REF="154">
Chandler's Shop for Nece&s;&s;aries of one &s;ort,
at the Apothecary's for another; here for
Food, there for Phy&s;ick; at the Baker's for
Bread, at the Alehou&s;e for Drink, till no
Body will credit him any farther; and being
not able to pay what he owes already, the
Baker arre&s;ts him, and that being known,
the Alehou&s;e-Keeper loads him with his
Action too, and &s;o the re&s;t; and the poor
Creature is carried to Gaol: There he can
neither work at one Price or another, but
begs at the Grate, and the fir&s;t cold Winter
is &s;tarved, and dies in the Pri&s;on: The Fa|mily
are to be &s;ure, on this &s;ad Occa&s;ion, in
the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s; and, as in the Ca&s;e be|fore,
they fall wholly upon the Pari&s;h.</P>
<P>NOW let us &s;um up the Account: I could
run it a great Way farther, but 'tis needle&s;s,
the Fact is too plain. This happens &s;o often,
no Man that under&s;tands Trade, need be &s;ent
to ask another about it: The young Trade&s;|man
need not go, and ask his Father; or the
antient Trade&s;man rumage his Memory; and
for the Time when it was thus, 'tis even ju&s;t
now upon us: And how many Tumults
have you had, and how many Riots, and
&s;ome Lives lo&s;t upon it? Nay, you are ob|liged
to keep a Party of Hor&s;e in <HI>Colche&s;ter,</HI>
another at <HI>Froome,</HI> and another at <HI>Bradford,</HI>
at this very Time, to keep the Peace
among the Poor, and to make them acquie&s;cc
<PB N="143" REF="155">
with their own Mi&s;ery; as to the Numbers
it has driven from their Work, and the di&s;|tre&s;s'd
Families that have been brought to the
Pari&s;hes by this means, let the People of the
Places inform you, who labour under the
Weight of it; and tho' the exqui&s;ite Manage|ment
of the Inhabitants, who&s;e Charge it has
been, keeps it down very much, yet 'tis a Load,
few Corporations in <HI>England</HI> could &s;upport.</P>
<P>THIS is &s;ome of the Effects of &s;inking the
Rate of our Manufacture; and who is the
better for all this? If it did indeed increa&s;e
the Con&s;umption, as is the Ca&s;e on many
other Occa&s;ions, according to the antient
Maxim in Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapne&s;s cau&s;es
Con&s;umption, &s;omething might be plead|ed
for it; but this Part, which I have &s;tated
among the Clothiers and their Dealers, is
not owing to a Stop or Decay of the fo|reign
or dome&s;tick Commerce; tho' it cannot
be, indeed, when there is a quick Demand for
the Goods abroad: But 'tis here owing all
to the Avarice of the over-grown Trade&s;|man,
of whom I mentioned above, that he
would ruin his Neighbours; and &s;o indeed
he would ruin the Country, in effect; for
every Thing that lowers the Rate of the
Poor's Wages, injures the Publick Stock.</P>
<P>I know a great Stir is made, about bring|ing
our Manufacture to be as cheap abroad
as may be; that rival Nations, may not be
able to weaken us, or to undermine our
<PB N="144" REF="156">
Manufacture: And this I grant mo&s;t readily;
but there are a hundred Ways to bring our
Manufacture down to a low Rate at a foreign
Market, be&s;ides that of running down the
Wages of the Maker, &s;uch as taking off all
Duties, and if need be, giving a Bounty on
the Exportation, to encourage it, which
Bounty might be levied again upon the Con|&s;umption
at Home or many other Ways.</P>
<P>BESIDES &s;inking the Rate of the Wages,
is not the be&s;t Way to render the Manufac|ture
cheap at the Markets abroad; my Rea|&s;ons
are brief, but &s;ound.</P>
<P>EVERY Thing is dear or cheap, as it is in
Proportion good or bad, or as the Goodne&s;s
is proportioned to the Price.</P>
<P>THERE is a manife&s;t Difference in Trade,
between cheap and low-priz'd: It is always
our Trading Intere&s;t, to have our Manufac|ture
cheap in the foreign Markets; but it
may not be always our Trading Intere&s;t to
have them low-priz'd; they may be cheap,
tho' high-prized, if the Sub&s;tance be rich, and
they may be dear tho' low-priz'd, if they are
mean in their Value. Now 'tis the Excellence
of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture, that it is the be&s;t
in all the foreign Markets of the World, and
tho' the Price may be high, yet the Manufac|ture
may be cheap; and it is &s;o with our Goods
at this Time, and therefore it is, that the be&s;t
Buyers always call for our Manufactures a|broad,
before tho&s;e, either of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Hol|land,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="157">
or any other Countries, whether it be
in <HI>Spain,</HI> or in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Turky</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI>
or wherever you go.</P>
<P>IT is true, the Engli&s;h Woollen Manufac|ture
bears the be&s;t Price in all the Markets
in the World: The Rea&s;on is plain; 'tis the
be&s;t of its kind, and, in Proportion to
its Goodne&s;s, is the cheape&s;t too in the
World.</P>
<P>NOW if you would bring down the Wa|ges
of the People that make it, whether it
be that of the Spinners or Weavers, or what|ever
People you employ, what will be the
Con&s;equence? You will lower the Price, 'tis
true, but then you will abate the Goodne&s;s
too; then you bring it to a Level with other
Country Clothing, and in &s;hort, ruin your
Manufacture, ruin its intrin&s;ick Value, and
that will ruin its Credit at Market, and that
in effect, is to ruin your Trade.</P>
<P>'TIS a Mi&s;take to &s;ay, the <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Dutch</HI> rival your Manufacture; they may
rival them indeed in Price, in endeavouring
to under&s;el you; but no Nation in the World
can come up to you in Goodne&s;s, or match
the intrin&s;ick Value of the Goods; and what
does all their rivalling and imitating your
Manufacture amount to? If they cannot equal
it in Goodne&s;s, equalling it in Price amounts
to nothing; a Diamond may be cheap, and
a Cart-Load of old Iron may be dear:
The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Manufacture is always good, its
<PB N="146" REF="158">
never dear, becau&s;e the Price is proportioned
to the Goodne&s;s, and is more than as much
better than the <HI>French,</HI> as it is in Price high|er;
and that is &s;o much more than equivalent
in the Market.</P>
<P>THIS as it re&s;pects foreign Trade, is in|deed
foreign to our Purpo&s;e, and therefore, I
pray, it may be taken for a Digre&s;&s;ion, or
read it in Parenthe&s;is, and &s;o you may read
it, or pa&s;s it over as you plea&s;e, the other
Work will read without it.</P>
<P>BUT I bring it back to our Inland Com|merce
thus; The Cheapne&s;s or Dearne&s;s of
that Part of our publick Stock, which is con|&s;umed
at Home, is not of one Farthing Va|lue
in our Trade, becau&s;e it is not of any
Weight, one Way or other in the publick
Stock. It is begun among our &s;elves, paid
for by our &s;elves, and to our &s;elves, and &s;o is
neither here or there, 'tis the &s;ame Thing;
and tho' all the Hands it pa&s;&s;es thro', rai&s;e a
Gain from it, and it goes on &s;addled with
their Expence, yet the la&s;t Con&s;umer pays it
all; he lo&s;es whatever others gain, and &s;o
you are but ju&s;t where you was; 'tis a Dance
truly in a Circle, and you end ju&s;t where
you began, the People live by one another,
and then live upon one another.</P>
<P>THUS the Plowman rai&s;es the Corn, which
pays his Landlord his Rent; the Poor buy the
Corn for Bread for their Families, which Corn
they pay for to the Countryman in Money;
<PB N="147" REF="159">
this enables him to pay his Landlord the Rent.
The Manufacturer employs the Poor, and
gives them a good Price for their Labour,
by which they are enabled to pay the Far|mers,
or the Bakers under them for their
Corn, that is, for their Bread; and again the
Trade&s;man employs the Manufacturer, and
pays him in Money, enabling him to em|ploy
the Poor, the Spinner, Weaver, <HI>&amp;C.</HI>
and thus the Money circulates with the Trade.</P>
<P>IF this Trade&s;man grinds down the Manu|facturer,
and abates his Price, as has been
hinted, the Abatement circulates through the
whole Trade, and influences every Branch,
even to the Landlord's Rent, as above; and
what Advantage is this to the Nation's Com|merce?
Not one Farthing in fact. Nor in|deed
does even the Con&s;umer, that is, the la&s;t
Buyer, or Wearer, ordinarily feel any Ad|vantage
by it: 'Tis all &s;unk in the Pocket of
the &s;aid over-grown Trade&s;man, who by this
means, becomes an Oppre&s;&s;or of his Fellow-Trade&s;men,
and is injurious to his Country,
and to the Commerce in general.</P>
<P>`Tis, therefore, no improper Maxim, to
lay down in a Di&s;cour&s;e of this Nature, that
a Trade&s;man grown over-great and over-rich,
is no Advantage to Trade in general. I have
read of a Law, which was in force in a cer|tain
I&s;land in the <HI>Levant,</HI> call'd <HI>Zia,</HI> that
whoever was &s;o unju&s;t to his Country, as
to live above &s;ixty Years, &s;hould be poi&s;oned;
<PB N="148" REF="160">
that the re&s;t of the People might not be in
Danger of being &s;tarv'd.</P>
<P>THIS was indeed a little barbarous; but
it would be much more rational in Commerce,
to make a Law, that after a Trade&s;man &s;hould
arrive to be worth above &s;uch a certain Sum,
&s;uppo&s;e it &s;hould be thirty, to forty, to fifty,
or to &s;ixty thou&s;and Pounds, place it where
you will, he &s;hould then be obliged to leave
off Trade, and have no more to do with
Commerce; I mean Shop-Keeping or Ware|hou&s;e-Keeping
Commerce; but &s;hould be
obliged to leave it to other Trade&s;men, that
he might not &s;tarve the poor young Trade&s;|men,
that &s;et up by him, by engro&s;&s;ing the
Bu&s;ine&s;s, and under&s;elling.</P>
<P>NOT that &s;uch a Law can be expected in
this Land of Liberty, but every Body will
claim to Trade, as long as they plea&s;e, and
for as much as they plea&s;e, and as cheap as
they plea&s;e. But it mu&s;t be &s;aid too, that it
is no le&s;s a Grievance in Trade for all that.</P>
<P>ALL regrating and fore&s;talling of Markets,
is accounted &s;o pernicious in Trade, that there
are Laws again&s;t it, as there is again&s;t Com|binations
and Engro&s;&s;ings al&s;o; in &s;hort, a
Man thus over-grown in Trade and Wealth,
is an Engro&s;&s;er and Fore&s;taller of Cour&s;e,
he is al&s;o a Combination in him&s;elf. How
often have we &s;een one over-rich Trade&s;man
attempt at an <HI>India</HI> Sale, to buy all the Cof|fee,
another all the Pepper, and &s;o of other
<PB N="149" REF="161">
Goods, and then put their own Price upon
tho&s;e Goods for a while, and &s;o impo&s;e upon
the whole Nation.</P>
<P>WE have had &s;everal Examples of this
kind in Trade here in <HI>London,</HI> but general|ly
without Succe&s;s; Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> of
<HI>Hackney,</HI> bought up once all the long Cloths
at an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Sale, amounting to 80000 <HI>l.</HI>
Sterling, and having the Command of a great
Shop of Ca&s;h, as I might call it, near <HI>Lom|bard-Street,</HI>
clear'd and paid for them all in
Time. We have &s;een the &s;ame done lately in
other Goods, as the Cochineal by one, and
the Pepper by another: But as the&s;e Engro&s;|&s;ings
did not u&s;ually &s;ucceed, &s;o indeed, nei|ther
is it the Advantage of Trade that it
&s;hould be &s;o; and &s;uch over-grown Trade&s;|men
are a Nu&s;ance in Trade.</P>
<P>AS I &s;aid, that Trade ought to circulate
through as many Hands as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o it is
not for the Advantage of the Trade in gene|ral,
to be managed by a few Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t Place, it is more in the Power
of tho&s;e few to make Combinations in Trade,
then it is when the Trade&s;men are multiply'd
to a greater Number; two or three great rich
Trade&s;men are able to join together, and to
buy up any Quantity of Goods; whereas if
the Trade was in the Hands of a great Num|ber,
they would never be brought into it,
or would never agree when they were in.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="162">
IT is certainly better, that fifty Trade&s;|men
were carrying on a particular Trade,
with every Man a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, than one
great over-grown Trade&s;man, with 50000 <HI>l.</HI>
Stock; for be&s;ides that by &s;o much Trade
being engro&s;&s;ed in one Hand, as would main|tain
fifty Families, 'tis al&s;o in the Power of
that one Trade&s;man to oppre&s;s, and perhaps
injure an hundred more, and in the End, ruin
&s;everal of them: This is too evident in ma|ny
Particulars. In a Word, an over-grown
Trade&s;man is a publick Grievance in Trade.</P>
<Q><P>1. AS by his flowing Stock, he has the
Opportunity of watching Advantages;
and buying only of the poore&s;t Dealers,
and when they, wanting Money, are obli|ged
to &s;ell, tho' to Lo&s;s, rather than not
rai&s;e immediate Ca&s;h to keep the Wheel
of their Trade a-going; like tho&s;e &s;aving
Hou&s;e-Keepers that go to Market at
eleven a-Clock at Night, when they
know the Butchers (willing to be gone)
will rather &s;ell a Joint of Meat for le&s;s
than it co&s;t them, than turn away a Cu&s;|tomer.
This is an Oppre&s;&s;ion upon
Trade, and is an Advantage meerly
owing to the Stock they have above
their Neighbours.</P>
<P>2. BY the va&s;t Stock they have in Trade,
they give large Credit where they think
the Trade&s;men they deal with are &s;afe,
<PB N="151" REF="163">
and by keeping &s;uch Men always in
their Books, they &s;ecure the Cu&s;tomer,
and make him pay a better Price than
otherwi&s;e he would do; &s;o making
them&s;elves whole that Way for what
they &s;ell at Under-Rates at other Times,
and to other Men.</P>
<P>3. WHERE they are rivall'd by any other
Trade&s;men, they immediately &s;ell their
Goods at Underprizes, to get and &s;ecure
the Trade from that Rival; and this
they will do, &s;o long, till they &s;hall tire
the other out, and cau&s;e them to give
it over. Thus I have &s;een a Brewer
in a Country. Town, when another has
&s;et up near him, &s;ell all his Beer Two
or Three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel cheaper,
on purpo&s;e to break the new Comer,
and carry it on, till he has brew'd him|&s;elf
a thou&s;and Pound out of Pocket,
and when the other, being overcome,
and perhaps almo&s;t broke, has given it
over, then he has rais'd his Price Four
or Five Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, till he has
made him&s;elf whole again, and then go
on upon a Level as before.</P>
<P>4. UPON all Occa&s;ions the&s;e Men &s;tand
ready to buy (as the Trade&s;men call
it) the good Bargains, to get all the
Pennyworths, which other Trade&s;men
cannot do for want of Money. In a
word, the&s;e are the Men that can buy
<PB N="152" REF="164">
cheap and &s;ell dear, and that have infi|nite
Advantages over their Neighbours;
and for that very Rea&s;on they are, as
I call it, a Burden and a Nu&s;ance to
Trade, an Injury to young Begin|ners,
the Ruin of the Poor, and a general
Calamity to the whole Nation; I mean
in its trading Capacity only, for other|wi&s;e
to have Men be Ma&s;ters of large
Stocks gain'd in Trade, is an Encou|ragement
to Trade it &s;elf, and a Benefit
to the Publick.</P></Q>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this Part by directing
the thriving rich or over-rich Trade&s;man
to act the generous Part; to charge it upon
him&s;elf, to continue, what 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed
he had been in his Beginning, namely, a
fair Trader; not to take unju&s;t and ruinous
Advantages in Trade; not to turn Devourer
in Bu&s;ine&s;s, cruel and voracious to his Neigh|bour;
cru&s;hing the poor Country Manufac|turer
or Whole&s;ale Dealer by either unfair
Buying or Under&s;elling.</P>
<P>LET him not grind the poor Manufactu|rer,
by forcing them to &s;ell cheaper than
'tis apparent he can work: He &s;hould
remember that the Man will but go home
and get it out of the labouring Poor,
and &s;o, as I &s;aid above, drive them to
the Jail, or to the Pari&s;h, or perhaps to
<PB N="153" REF="165">
both; the Man to the fir&s;t, and his Wife
and Children to the la&s;t.</P>
<P>HE &s;hould remember that by thus buying
cheaper than the Maker can &s;ell, he not only
makes the Manufacturer oppre&s;s and cru&s;h
the Poor, and &s;o, as has been &s;aid, &s;catter
and di&s;per&s;e them, le&s;&s;en the Con&s;umption
of the Produce, and &s;o cau&s;e both Labour
and Land to &s;ink together; but he oppre&s;&s;es
the Trade it&s;elf, wrongs the Credit of the
Goods, and brings them down as Market;
becau&s;e the Maker being impos'd upon in the
Abatement of Price, by the Con&s;equence
abates in the Goodne&s;s of his Goods, and
brings them wor&s;e to Market than ever he
did before.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the Thing implies it: If
the Price is abated, the Workman&s;hip will
abate; the Spinners, Weavers, and Cloth|workers
all are affected, and all will agree in
this Method, that if you will not give the
u&s;ual Price, you cannot expect the Goods
to be of the u&s;ual Goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>AND what's the Con&s;equence of all this,
but that in the End the Trade is ruin'd, the
Manufacture &s;poil'd, the Trade&s;men are
broke, the Poor remov'd, and the Manufac|ture,
in a word, is given over? 'Tis not
known again by its own Face, or call'd by
its own Name; the very Names of the
Goods are lo&s;t in the World: New Manu|factures
are invented, and &s;o the Trade goes
<PB N="154" REF="166">
round in a Circle; the Rich devour the
Poor, the Poor &s;tarve the Manfacture,
and the Badne&s;s of the Manufacture ruins
the Trade; and this is the Rea&s;on why &s;uch
flouri&s;hing Trade&s;men every Day break,
and are undone, namely, that vying with one
another in this Manner of Trade, and &s;ink|ing
their Goods, they fall together, ruin
them&s;elves and the Trade too.</P>
<P>SUCH Trade&s;men as the&s;e &s;hould leave
off; 'tis Time they &s;hould leave Room for
tho&s;e that come after them: To &s;ee a Trade&s;|man
worth forty or fifty thou&s;and Pound,
and yet trading &s;ill, plodding &s;till, I look
upon him like a great Dragon in a Wood,
that devours all the Travellers, till &s;ome
great Accident happens, that di&s;arms him,
and puts an End to him, and to the Spoil he
does, all at once.</P>
<P>ENGROSSING Trade is in it&s;elf as much
an Evil as engro&s;&s;ing any particular Goods
in Trade; it is a Combination which is al|ways
e&s;teem'd a Grievance; that Man is a
Fund of Commerce in him&s;elf, and he has
held it &s;o long, that he is a meer Combi|nation
in him&s;elf, though he has no Corre|&s;pondence
in it with others: As he him&s;elf
confederates with him&s;elf, he buys up all
the large Parcels of Goods, which are too
great for other Trade&s;men in his own Way
to buy, then &s;ells them all out among tho&s;e
Trade&s;men, but with an Advance to him|&s;elf;
<PB N="155" REF="167">
&s;o that he as effectually &s;ecures them
from &s;elling under &s;uch or &s;uch a Price, as
if they had combin'd together po&s;itively not
to do it, and none but him&s;elf can under|&s;ell;
for at the &s;ame Time he can &s;ell as
cheap as he will; he can &s;ell as low as
they bought, that is to &s;ay, he can &s;ell as
cheap to another Chapman as he did to tho&s;e
of his own Trade.</P>
<P>THUS he is a Bite upon the Men of his
own Trade; for they are bound, and he is
loo&s;e; they are bound by their Intere&s;t not
to &s;ell cheaper than they bought, and he at
the &s;ame Time is free to &s;ell as low as he
did to them, by which Means they can &s;ell
none while he has any left.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;candalous doing is this? 'tis
a Tyranny in Trade; the over-grown
Trade&s;man is, in &s;hort, a trading Tyrant,
and he tyrannizes in a mo&s;t unju&s;t and
unrea&s;onable Manner over all the Trade&s;|men
of his own Cla&s;s; nay, he tyrannizes
over Trade it&s;elf; for while it is the true
Intere&s;t of Trade to be extended, and dilated
in &s;uch a Manner, that as many Families,
and as many People as po&s;&s;ible, may be em|ploy'd
in, and maintain'd by it; he, on
the contrary, contracts it, crowds it into a
narrow Compa&s;s, manages as much in his
own little Circle, and perhaps with four or
five Servants, as would and might, and in|deed
ought to employ and maintain twenty
<PB N="156" REF="168">
Families of Head-Trade&s;men, &s;uch as him|&s;elf,
or at lea&s;t &s;uch as him&s;elf was when
he begun, and their Servants, &s;uppo&s;e two
Servants to each Shop.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he is a Tyrant, and an Oppre&s;|for
to tho&s;e very Servants who he keeps;
for &s;uppo&s;e, for Example, he keeps at a
Time five Apprentices; when the&s;e Ap|prentices
come out of their Times, he
&s;tarves them; he prevents them; they may
ea&s;ily &s;ee 'tis to no Purpo&s;e to &s;et up near
him; there's no body can live within his
Compa&s;s; like a high, old, over&s;preading
Tree, it ought to be cut down, or at lea&s;t
the Branches be loppp'd off; for nothing
will grow under it; what with keeping the
Beams of the Sun off, and what with drop|ping
continually in wet Weather, and &s;hed|ding
a whole Surface of Leaves at another
Sea&s;on, its Greatne&s;s and Breadth makes the
very Soil barren about it; nothing can
thrive under its Shade.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man thus over-grown with
Stock, and pu&s;hing on his Trade with a power|ful
Ca&s;h, is a de&s;tructive Shade to all the
young Trade&s;men that &s;et up near him;
&s;o that he breeds up Apprentices, in &s;hort,
to nothing; he takes their Money, indeed,
and has the Benefit of their &s;even Years
Services, and when they come out of their
Times, they are ju&s;t where they were; they
can do nothing for them&s;elves, unle&s;s they
<PB N="157" REF="169">
go out of his Reach, out of his Knowledge;
and as that is to go out of their own Know|ledge
too, &s;o all the Acquaintance they
have made in the Time of their Service is of
no U&s;e to them.</P>
<P>NOR does it end here; but perhaps in
the Town they go to, there's &s;uch another
trading Tyrant, and &s;o on in a third Place;
and what if there were one in every con&s;ide|rable
trading Town? as to &s;peak the Truth,
there are few without; what then? what
mu&s;t young Trade&s;men do? The An&s;wer is
be&s;t given by pleading the Fact; what do
they do? 'Tis plain: They do &s;et up, and
labour in the Fire; &s;ome few &s;truggle hard,
and by Dint of Indu&s;try and Stock, make
Shi&s;t to hold it till kind Death, or &s;ome other
Accident, removes the Tyrant Trade&s;man,
and then the Stream of Trade that was
damm'd up, breaks out, and every one gets
&s;ome, as in a great Drought, a ha&s;ty Rain
making a Flood, the low Lands drink in their
Fill, and then the re&s;t are refre&s;h'd.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean Time, how many poor
young Trade&s;tmen are cru&s;h'd, and not being
able to live under the Droppings of this great
Tree, langui&s;h a while, &s;tarve and die away?
I mean, die as Trade&s;men? that is to &s;ay,
fail and break, or wa&s;te what Stock they had,
and are obliged to give over, for Fear of it?
In which la&s;t Ca&s;e, they always come off
with Wounds and Scars, Lo&s;&s;es, and le&s;&s;en|ing
<PB N="158" REF="170">
of their Fortunes; and this makes &s;o
many young Trade&s;men go abroad; pu&s;hing
&s;ome into one Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome into another,
to rai&s;e their Fortunes, and &s;ome into the
Armies.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be added too, that this is a
Calamity in Trade, and abundantly proves
that it is injurious; that to have too much
Trade engro&s;s'd into one Hand, is taking the
Bread from the Mouths of many others that
have a Right to be fed with it, and is an Ex|orbitance
which, if it were po&s;&s;ible, ought to
be prevented. Trade &s;hould be a current
Channel, and ought to flow for the Benefit
of the whole Body: Indu&s;try claims an
Encouragement; and though a great and rich
Trade&s;man cannot be legally limited and re|&s;train'd
from continuing in Trade, as long
as he plea&s;es; yet &s;uch a Man may be told,
that he &s;hould not make him&s;elf an Oppre&s;|for
in Trade; that he &s;hould not be an un|fair
Trader at his latter End, that was not
&s;o in his Beginning; that he &s;hould have a
ju&s;t Regard to the Trade it &s;elf, as well as to
his private and particular Profit; not to run
down the Price of Goods, or the Labour of
the Poor, only becau&s;e he can gain when
others cannot.</P>
<P>In a word, he may be told, that he is
a common Grievance to the Trade in gene|ral,
and to his Country, when he does &s;o;
and that he cea&s;es to be a Compleat Trade&s;|man,
<PB N="159" REF="171">
when he turns Engro&s;&s;er and Under|miner
of his Neighbours. The Compleat
Trade&s;man is a generous Trade&s;man, and
will not be an unfair Trader, will not act
to the Prejudice, either of his Trading
Neighbours, or of the Trade it &s;elf: Where
&s;uch are, and how hard they are to be found,
is a Subject to be &s;poken of by it &s;elf.</P>

<P>_HAVING taken the Freedom to
tell the rich over-grown Trade&s;|man,
that he is never too high to
fall, that he is never out of the
Reach of Di&s;a&s;ter, till he is quite out of

Pro&s;perity to be call'd rich, and yet is not
di&s;pos'd to lay down.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="172">
FOR though I do &s;ay, it would be the be&s;t
Step a Trade&s;man could take after he is ri&s;en
up to the Magnitude of 20000 <HI>l.</HI> as I men|tioned
before, to lay down, and draw out of
Trade; yet I do not lay it down as a Rule,
and that it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to him to
lay down at &s;uch or &s;uch a Time, or that
he cannot lawfully and hone&s;tly continue lon|ger
in Trade.</P>
<P>THERE may be Circum&s;tances which may
plead for a continuing in Trade, though a
Man be arriv'd to &s;uch a Degree of Wealth;
he may have a large Family to provide for,
Children to breed up in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to
carry it on after him; Daughters to marry,
and to whom it is his Intere&s;t to bring their
Husbands into Part of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and &s;o
he may divide it into &s;everal Parts.</P>
<P>PART of his Sub&s;tance may be abroad in
foreign Adventures, and he may think it pro|per
to wait till it comes &s;afe in; for a Trade&s;|man
is not a Compleat Trade&s;man till he has
got all his Effects Home, every Bottom
wound up, and his E&s;tate lodg'd, either in
the Bank, or in &s;ome e&s;tabli&s;h'd Fund, where
he is &s;ure to enjoy its Revenue, without Ha|zard
or Defalkation of any kind.</P>
<P>IN this Ca&s;e, and &s;uppo&s;ing all &s;afe, we
mu&s;t talk of him in a different Po&s;ition: 'Tis
certain, leaving off his Bu&s;ine&s;s with twenty
thou&s;and Pounds in his Pocket, he changes
his Situation in the World, that is to &s;ay,
<PB N="161" REF="173">
he lays down the Trade&s;man, and takes up
the Gentleman with a thou&s;and Pounds a
Year E&s;tate.</P>
<P>AS he begins his new Figure in &s;uch an
advanc'd Station, let me give &s;ea&s;nable
Hint to him; and then as he has done with
Trade, &s;o I &s;hall have done with him; for
I am not writing to the Gentleman, but
the Trade&s;man.</P>
<Q><P>1. AS he has been bred up a Trade&s;man,
he will not be to &s;eek in what Part of
Life to begin; a managing Gentleman
is certainly the &s;afe&s;t in his Circum&s;tan|ces;
the one main Thing he has to do
as a Gentleman, is only to live within
the Compa&s;s of his Income, within the
Limits of his E&s;tate.</P>
<P>HE that has a thou&s;and Pounds a Year E&s;tate
ought to &s;pend five hundred a Year, and
no more: He that once comes to lay
up five hundred Pounds a Year, out of
his Eftate, will always &s;ee a ri&s;ing Fa|mily
under him; as he that &s;pends
but one hundred Pounds a Year more
than his E&s;tate brings in, will always
be nece&s;&s;itous, under the Hatches,
mu&s;t borrow, mortgage, or &s;ell, and
&s;o gradually bleeds to Death.</P></Q>
<P>LET the managing Trade&s;man be but a
managing Gentleman too, and he is made for
<PB N="162" REF="174">
Ages, his Family is e&s;tabli&s;hed; every two
Years he can add fifty Pounds a Year in
Land to his E&s;tate; and if he lives twenty
Years in &s;uch a Circum&s;tance, adding the
additional Income, and the Advances made
by it, he leaves his E&s;tate doubled, and
grown up to two thou&s;and Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>THE great Misfortune of this luxurious
Age is, that the Gentlemen of <HI>Great Bri|tain</HI>
cannot do thus; that they mu&s;t, and do,
and will live, as the <HI>Scots</HI> calls it, in the
middle of their Geer, that is, to the Extent
of their Revenue; and this is the Rea&s;on,
that they not only cannot increa&s;e, but will
always decline, unle&s;s they plea&s;e to take up,
and live within the Compa&s;s of their E&s;tates.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Truth, that the Luxu|ry
of the Gentry is the Pro&s;perity of the
Trade&s;man; the high and expen&s;ive Way
of Living, which the Gentry of this Nation
are, of late fallen into, is a too certain Foun|dation
of the Increa&s;e of Commerce, and of
the Ruin of the Gentry both together; it is
true, frequent War, a flouri&s;hing Court, and
the Increa&s;e of publick Bu&s;ine&s;s, is a Door
at which Preferment enters, by which the
Po&s;terity of the pre&s;ent declined Fami|lies
may ri&s;e again, and the young beggar'd
Gentry may pick up a little; but &s;uppo&s;e
that, what a Decimation do they fir&s;t &s;uffer?
how few are tho&s;e that ri&s;e to tho&s;e that fall?
and how poor are the ordinary Heights they
<PB N="163" REF="175">
ri&s;e to, compar'd to what their luxuriant An|ce&s;tors
fell from?</P>
<P>LET the mi&s;erable Li&s;t of Half-Pay Men,
the Skeletons of the late War, te&s;tify this: What
are they look'd upon to be at this Time? Are
they not the Nation's Pen&s;ioners, &s;pending the
Remains of their Days as their Parents did?
The Remains of their Fortune is a kind of
Indolence, that them&s;elves are a&s;ham'd of,
like an old Weapon growing ru&s;ty for want
of U&s;e, till by meer Time, they grow In|valids
to their Country, as they have been
all along to them&s;elves; and if a War does
not intervene to re&s;tore them to Action, they
die off, only to relieve their Country, and
ea&s;e the Publick of the Charge of them.</P>
<P>BUT I return to the exalted Trade&s;man:
He knows the World too well, not to know,
that not to live within the Compa&s;s of his E&s;|tate,
is to condemn him&s;elf to a declining Con|dition
from the fir&s;t Hour; and who would
think, that obliging him&s;elf to live within
the Compa&s;s of five, or &s;ix, or &s;even hun|dred
a Year Expence, can be called a Con|finement?</P>
<P>HE
that has been a frugal managing Man
in Trade, can never, with his Sen&s;es about
him, turn an unthinking ftupid Extravagant
when he leaves off: 'Tis contrary to the very
Nature of the Thing; 'tis contrary to the or|dinary
Cour&s;e of his Life; he mu&s;t lay a&s;ide
all his Experience, his Under&s;tanding in Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
<PB N="164" REF="176">
and Knowledge of the World; for
there is &s;omething &s;o ab&s;urd in a Life of
imprudent Expence, that a Man bred in Bu|&s;ine&s;s
can never fall into it, unle&s;s he has
fir&s;t forfeited all his former Capacities, and
is no more able to make any Judgment of
Things.</P>
<P>IT is not po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould not &s;ee the
&s;pending more than his Income mu&s;t end in
Ruin, mu&s;t reduce that Income, and oblige
him at la&s;t to le&s;&s;en the Expence double to
the fir&s;t Extravagance: 'Tis very &s;eldom that
Trade&s;men, who have labour'd for the getting
an E&s;tate, are them&s;elves the De&s;troyers of
it; they know too well how to ca&s;t up Profit
and Lo&s;s, and 'tis too natural to them to look
into Things, to let them run on to Extremi|ties.</P>
<P>HENCE,
I think there is the le&s;s Need to
talk to the Trade&s;man after he has laid down,
and is li&s;ted among the Gentry, than before.
I therefore return to him, as yet a Trade&s;man,
tho' rich, and when in the Height of his
trading Fortunes; for ju&s;t then when he be|gins
to cool in his trading Warmth, and enter|tains
Thoughts of laying down and leaving
off, but has not yet done it, I &s;ay, then is an|other
Cri&s;is of the Trade&s;man's Fortunes, a
Juncture when he is in Danger of a Blow,
much more than he was in the full Cour&s;e
of his Trade, or perhaps may ever be after
it.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="177">
1. THEN he is in the greate&s;t Danger of
Projects, and that with this particular Mi&s;|chief,
that if he adventures upon any Thing,
'tis generally &s;omething large, great, propor|tion'd
to the Figure he made in Bu&s;ine&s;s be|fore,
that is to &s;ay, it will be as equal in Danger
to his Capacity of bearing, as le&s;&s;er Projects
are to le&s;&s;er People; and indeed the Diffe|rence
between them lies here only, <HI>namely,</HI>
that a little Trade&s;man is ruined by little Pro|jects,
a capital over-grown Trade&s;man by
larger Undertakings; with this Di&s;advan|tage
&s;till to the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> that if his great
Undertakings mi&s;carry, the Blow is gene|rally
irrecoverable, and the Wound incu|rable.</P>
<P>LESSER
Hurts may be healed; but the&s;e
are mortal Wounds, or no Wounds at all.
I could name &s;ome of the va&s;t Undertakings
which deep Heads have run into, which
have been too great for any &s;ingle Hands to
manage, too heavy for any &s;ingle Backs to
bear; &s;uch was farming the Revenues of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> by Alderman <HI>Forth,</HI> engro&s;&s;ing
the Long Cloth and Sallampores by Sir
<HI>Thomas Cook;</HI> building whole Streets, or
Towns rather, be&s;ides <HI>O&s;terly-Hou&s;e,</HI> by
Doctor <HI>Barebone;</HI> planting Colonies in <HI>New
Jer&s;ey, Pen&s;ilvania,</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> and ma|ny
others; all which mortally wounded the
Fortunes and Credit of the Undertakers of
them, even after they were worth not
<PB N="166" REF="178">
20000 <HI>l.</HI> only, but &s;ome of them three or four
Times tho&s;e Sums.</P>
<P>I know nothing in which a rich <HI>Leaving|off</HI>
Trade&s;men has more need of Advice,
than ju&s;t at the Time of advancing into
&s;ome Capital Undertaking, that has a fair
Pro&s;pect, but a remote and va&s;tly extended
View; which if it takes, will indeed do great
Things, but if it mi&s;carries, will undo great
Things al&s;o, and ruin him after he is already
made rich.</P>
<P>WHAT Temptation but that I mentioned
before, of meer Avarice, can lie in the Way
of a Man worth 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his Pocket?
what can he propo&s;e to him&s;elf, better than
what he already has? If it be to get an E&s;|tate,
he is an&s;wered, he has an E&s;tate. As
I &s;aid before, he has a thou&s;and a Year in
Hand, and a moral Certainty of a thou&s;and
a Year more, with a Negative only.</P>
<P>IT is a very remarkable Difference which
attends the Trade&s;man I am &s;peaking to,
in the Con&s;equence of this Management; his
Pro&s;perity con&s;i&s;ted before all in the active
Part of Life; in Diligence, Application,
Endeavour, and turning his Head and Hand
to every profitable Thing in the Road and
Cour&s;e of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and I have &s;aid
enough to &s;pur the young Trade&s;man on to
Diligence, on Purpo&s;e to bring him to this
Circum&s;tance of Life, which I call rich.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="179">
BUT now being to wind off the Bottom,
being grown rich, and re&s;olv'd to leave off,
as he is going to change the Figure of his
Life, and place him&s;elf in a quite differing
Po&s;ture in Life, &s;o the Direction is quite dif|ferent
al&s;o, for now his only Virtue is Indo|lence,
the only &s;afe Part he is to act (if it be
proper to call it acting) is, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> to do no|thing,
and I mu&s;t add, it is the mo&s;t difficult
Part too.</P>
<P>IT is not difficult only, but next to im|po&s;&s;ible
to a Trade&s;man, bred to Bu&s;ine&s;s,
bred to be always looking &s;harp out, watch|ing
Advantages, and then taking hold of
them, improving every Hint, pu&s;hing every
vi&s;ible Advantage; 'tis next to impo&s;&s;ible,
for &s;uch a Man to &s;it &s;till, and do nothing;
to &s;ee the World flow up to his very Teeth,
and not open his Mouth to take it in; 'tis
again&s;t the very Current of his Blood;
he cannot do it; Nature, Rea&s;on, and every
Thing about him, at lea&s;t by their Out&s;ides,
call upon him to come in, and be made at
once. But a good Judgment, and the Event
of Things fore&s;een at a Di&s;tance, would with|hold
him; there his Rea&s;on would &s;ound
a Negative to him, and bid him &s;tand, <HI>fa&s;t.
Come in and be made:</HI> Why I am made, <HI>&s;ays
he;</HI> I dont want it. <HI>Come in and be rich,</HI>
Avarice &s;ays: I am rich; and can, with Pa|tience,
be as much richer as I plea&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="180">
HOW many over-grown rich Trade&s;men,
leaving off, nay, who had left off Trade,
and retir'd to enjoy what they had got,
came at this unhappy Summons of their
Avarice, into the late publick Infatuation,
ruin'd at one Blow the Fruits of forty Years
unwearied Diligence and Labour, and
went out and hang'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AND yet who could with&s;tand the At|tack;
the very Principle of a Trade&s;man
fell in with it: There was no room to re&s;i&s;t
it; Nature hardly furni&s;h'd them with one
Word to &s;ay again&s;t clo&s;ing with it: 'Twas
the harde&s;t Thing in the World to reconcile
the Negative to common Sen&s;e; and yet
none but tho&s;e who adher'd to the Nega|tive,
even again&s;t common Sen&s;e, were &s;afe;
unle&s;s they got &s;afe out after they were
plung'd deep in, which was next to impo&s;|&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT
to leave exclaiming at particular
Examples, the Advice is general, and will
hold good in all its &s;everal Parts: The rich
Trade&s;man once left off, having converted
his Money into &s;olid Rents, laid the Trade&s;|man
down, and commenc'd Gentleman, as
above, he ought the fir&s;t Thing he does to
put a re&s;olved Negative upon all Propo&s;als
of Bu&s;ine&s;s what&s;oever: He has one e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd
Bu&s;ine&s;s before him, and in that he
is effectually &s;afe, has no Ri&s;que to run, no
Dangers in View; 'twill make him rich with|out
<PB N="169" REF="181">
Po&s;&s;iblity of Mi&s;carriage, and that is,
live upon one Half of his Income, and lay
up the other Half: Such a Man is out of
the Reach of Fortune or Misfortune; no
Ca&s;ualty can reach him; 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he
can be hurt.</P>
<P>IF he leaves off, as I have &s;aid, at 20000 <HI>l.</HI>
in his Pocket, that is, at 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
E&s;tate, how ea&s;ily will he rai&s;e his Revenue
to 2000 <HI>l.?</HI> and how ea&s;ily may his Suc|ce&s;&s;or,
pur&s;uing that Method, advance it
to almo&s;t what Magnitude he plea&s;es?</P>
<P>PRUDENT Management, and frugal Living,
will increa&s;e any Fortune to any Degree:
I knew a private Gentleman, who&s;e Father
&s;et him up thus, worth 20000<HI>l.</HI> and bid
him go and &s;et up for a Gentleman, for he
would not let him meddle with Trade. The
Father had gotten a great E&s;tate by Mer|chandize;
but told his Son 20000<HI>l.</HI> was a
very good Trade, and if he manag'd it well,
he would be rich without running the Ri&s;ques
of a Merchant.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman took the Hint,
and begun the World with a good E&s;tate,
liv'd frugally, yet hand&s;omely; purchas'd an
E&s;tate of 1500<HI>l. per Annum</HI> with his own
Stock and his Wife's Fortune, which was
very con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he went on for &s;ome
Years, till his Family increas'd: He &s;pent
about 300<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> then 400<HI>l.</HI> and
<PB N="170" REF="182">
at length 500<HI>l.</HI> Before he came to &s;pend 400<HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> he had rai&s;ed his E&s;tate to 1800<HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> by the mere Increa&s;e of its
own Income; always putting the Money out
as fa&s;t as it came in, upon the publick Se|curities,
which at that Time paid 7 <HI>l. per
Cent.</HI> Intere&s;t. At the End of fifteen Years
he had rai&s;ed his E&s;tate to 2500<HI>l.</HI> a Year,
the Sub&s;cription or Engraftment, as it was then
called, to the <HI>Bank,</HI> falling in at that Time:
When his E&s;tate was thus large, he took a
larger Hou&s;e into his Hands, being of his
own E&s;tate too; and &s;etting up a Coach,
his Expences amounted to near 800<HI>l.</HI> a
Year, not more; and at that Time his old
Father died, and left him a va&s;t Addition
to his Fortune, being no le&s;s than between
50 and 60000<HI>l.</HI> in Money and Rents; &s;o
that when it was all put together, he had a
clear E&s;tate of between 5 and 6000<HI>l.</HI> a
Year.</P>
<P>AS he liv'd in a hand&s;ome Figure before,
&s;o he did not at all enlarge his Equipage
on this Occa&s;ion; but his Family growing
numerous, and al&s;o growing up, obliged him
to an Expence of about 1000 to 1200 <HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> never more.</P>
<P>THIS Man lived twenty two Years after
his Father's la&s;t Lump was left him; and
going on upon the &s;ame prudential Improve|ment
as above, it was found at his Death,
that he had 16000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> &s;tated Re|venue,
<PB N="171" REF="183">
and almo&s;t 90000<HI>l.</HI> in Ready Mo|ney,
that is to &s;ay, in the <HI>Bank, Exchequer,</HI>
and &s;uch other publick Securities, as were to
be e&s;teemed Ready Money.</P>
<P>ONCE I &s;aw a Caculation made from his
E&s;tate in his own Pre&s;ence; for I had &s;o
far an Intimacy with his Affairs, by which
it appear'd, that in twenty five Years more,
had he liv'd &s;o long, he mu&s;t have been
worth two Millions Sterling.</P>
<P>'TIS true this was rai&s;ed from a capital
Beginning; but 'tis as true, that every Be|ginning,
where the Expence is within the
Compa&s;s of the Income, will do the &s;ame
Thing in Proportion, and that without any
Ri&s;que of mi&s;carrying. Indeed (human Vi|ciffitudes
allow'd for) a Man that lives thus
within the Limits of his Revenue, cannot
mi&s;carry; there's no Room for Di&s;a&s;ter, no
Po&s;&s;ibility of Mi&s;carriage.</P>
<P>He does not increa&s;e by Art and by Craft,
not by Management of Stock, or making
Gain of this or that particular Thing; he
increa&s;es by Nature, by the mere Con&s;equence
of Things; if fix comes in, and four goes out,
there mu&s;t be two left behind; nothing can
break in upon the Security of this Man's
Affairs, but &s;ome publick Calamity, &s;uch
a War, as &s;hould expo&s;e us to publick Inva|&s;ions
and Depredations of an Enemy, to ra|vage
the Land, and burn down the Tenants
Hou&s;es; and even in &s;uch a Ca&s;e they could
<PB N="172" REF="184">
not carry away the Land; the Fee-Simple,
with After-Years of Peace would re&s;tore all
again.</P>
<P>WHY then &s;hould the Trade&s;man look
any where but right before him? If he is
withdrawn from Trade, let him fix his Staff
down there, and never turn to the Right
Hand, or to the Left; he has an E&s;tate and
an E&s;tabli&s;hment for his Life, by that he
&s;tands, and keeping to that he can never fall;
let him re&s;olve to give the Negative to eve|ry
Propo&s;al, to every Offer, however ad|vantageous;
and till he can do that, he is
never &s;afe.</P>
<P>FROM the fir&s;t Hour that he withdraws
out of Trade, he &s;hould re&s;olve to with|draw
wholly out of it, and then he may
write <HI>Secure</HI> upon his Door, and not till then,
becau&s;e Trade is never without its Hazards;
an E&s;tate as an E&s;tate, is in no Danger, but
from the Kitchen and the Stable. Nothing
wounds the E&s;tate, but the Table and the
Equipage, if the Expence is kept under the
Revenue, the Man will always grow, and
be always growing; if not, I need not &s;ay,
what will follow: Cau&s;es and Con&s;equences
are always &s;teady and the &s;ame, and will
ever be &s;o to the End of Time.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o many Di&s;a&s;ters in Trade,
which &s;ometimes bear hard upon, even the
mo&s;t Capital Trade&s;men, and that &s;o hard, as
to hazard their Ruin, even in the Highe&s;t of
<PB N="173" REF="185">
their Fortunes: The &s;udden ri&s;ing and fal|ling
of any one particular Article in Trade,
how has it &s;unk a particular Trade&s;man, four
to five thou&s;and Pounds at a Time? This I
have known frequently happen, and that in
&s;everal particular Sorts of Goods; and this
dips deep into a Trade&s;man's Stock, tho' he
&s;hould be &s;o overgrown, as we have now
de&s;cribed: The &s;udden Surprize of Fires, as
&s;uch Di&s;a&s;ters are &s;ometimes circum&s;tanced,
and e&s;pecially, before the late In&s;urances of
Goods in Warehou&s;es have been &s;et up. I
could name &s;ome &s;o very con&s;iderable with|in
the&s;e few Years, as had not &s;uch In&s;uran|ces
been made, would have overthrown a
Man of 20000<HI>l.</HI> Stock; but 'tis not proper
to enter upon Particulars of &s;uch a Nature,
where the Examples are &s;till in being and in
Bu&s;ine&s;s. 'Tis an ill Office to publi&s;h
Trade&s;men Lo&s;&s;es, 'tis what &s;hould be con|ceal'd,
not reviv'd, e&s;pecially while the
Men are living and trading.</P>
<P>BUT to go back beyond our pre&s;ent Age,
Sir <HI>William Warren</HI> was a famous Ju&s;tice,
who by three, if not more Fires in <HI>Wap|ping,</HI>
was &s;o demoli&s;hed, not only his Dwel|ling
Hou&s;e, but whole Streets of Hou&s;es of
his own building, and rebuilding, burnt down,
that from a Man of a very great acquired
Fortune by Bu&s;ine&s;s, he was reduc'd to very
mean Circum&s;tances, and yet had no other
<PB N="174" REF="186">
apparent Lo&s;&s;es, at lea&s;t none that were con|&s;iderable.</P>
<P>THE &s;hutting up the Exchequer in King
<HI>Charles</HI> II's Time, how did it at once reduce
the Fortunes and Credit too of the chief
Bankers in <HI>Lombard-Street?</HI> eleven of them
were, as it evidently appear'd by the Accounts
afterwards given into Parliament, Men of
clear and great E&s;tates, from 20000<HI>l.</HI> the lea&s;t,
to immen&s;e Sums the highe&s;t; yet at one
Blow, they fell as if they had been blown
up with Gunpowder, or as the City of <HI>Pa|lermo</HI>
lately fell by an Earthquake.</P>
<P>BUT to go no farther back than our own
Times; Will any Man &s;ay a Trade&s;man is
&s;afe from Di&s;a&s;ter? Let &s;uch look back upon
our late War, when not &s;ome Ships only, but
whole Fleets of Ships fell into the Hands of
the <HI>French,</HI> &s;o that 3000 Sail were taken
before the Seas were any Thing like being
defended or duly guarded: Or to look on
our Affair of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> or our Neigh|bours
of the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;ipi,</HI> how many ruined
Families are to be &s;een in either Nation, and
among the Trade&s;men only, who before that
Time were as much above the Fear of Di&s;|a&s;ter,
as 20000<HI>l.</HI> can be &s;uppo&s;ed to make
any Man be.</P>
<P>LARGE Adventures are the Fate of large
Stocks in Trade; Men in the Height of Trade
do not, like young Beginners, venture a little
here and a little there; con&s;equently, if Lo&s;|&s;es
<PB N="175" REF="187">
come, they fall heavy. I have &s;een a
Trade&s;man in <HI>London</HI> give up his Books,
where he has appear'd to be worth 40000<HI>l.</HI>
clear of all Debts and Demands, and yet
&s;ink and become Bankrupt in le&s;s than two
Years, and be, as we call it in Trade, half
as much wor&s;e than nothing.</P>
<P>IF this then is the Ca&s;e, and the Trade&s;|man
is never &s;afe while he is in Trade, he is
&s;o long not out of the Reach, no, nor out
of the Want of good Advice; and the fir&s;t
Advice I would give a rich Trade&s;man, be|&s;ides
what I have mentioned already, is, not
to run into great Adventures on the Pre&s;ump|tion
of his great Stock, or which is wor&s;e,
not on Pre&s;umption of his great Credit; not
to ri&s;que, becau&s;e he can bear a Lo&s;s, but
as he grows rich let his Warine&s;s and his Cau|tions
increa&s;e, as his Stock increa&s;es.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of &s;ome Men famous in
Story for their Bravery and Courage, that
when they grew rich they grew Cowards,
and backward to run Hazards. The Story
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Merchant, who lifted under
<HI>Sertorius,</HI> whether Fact or a Fable, is very
applicable to this Ca&s;e: He came a Stranger
into the Army, but was &s;oon made remark|able
to the whole Camp, and to the Gene|ral
in particular, by his Gallantry, and by
his Courage on the mo&s;t de&s;perate and diffi|cult
Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="188">
AT Length the General &s;ent for him, and
de&s;ir'd to know him, and told him he had
been Witne&s;s to his Behaviour, and that he
was ju&s;tly admir'd for his Courage and Bra|very,
and enquired into his Circum&s;tances:
He told the General, that he was a Merchant
of <HI>Italy:</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e he told him of what
Place in particular; that travelling Home|ward
out of <HI>Gaul,</HI> he fell among Thieves,
and was robb'd of all he had; by which be|ing
utterly undone and reduc'd to Beggary
and Di&s;tre&s;s, he came into the Army for no
other End, but to die honourably, and &s;o
put an End to a Life of Mi&s;ery and De&s;pe|ration.</P>
<P>THE
General mov'd with Compa&s;&s;ion, for
his Misfortunes, and pleas'd that he could
reward a Man of &s;uch Merit, gave him a
Commi&s;&s;ion, as we call it, that is, made him
a Centurion; his Behaviour &s;till continuing
brave, he advanc'd him to the Command of
a Cohort, that is to &s;ay, made him a Colonel;
a Cohort generally con&s;i&s;ting of from 800 to
1000 Men.</P>
<P>SOME Time after this, <HI>Sertorius</HI> having
&s;ome particular Pieces of Service, which re|quired
an Officer of known Experience and
try'd Courage, he &s;ingled this Man out, and
gave him the Introduction to it, with a Com|pliment
upon his Fidelity and Valour, which
he had &s;een try'd upon &s;o many extraordi|nary
Occa&s;ions. But was &s;urpri&s;ed to find
<PB N="177" REF="189">
that it was not received with the &s;ame Alacrity
and chearful Countenance as u&s;ual; but on
the contrary, with a kind of Reluctance
and Backwardne&s;s not u&s;ual in Men of Cou|rage.</P>
<P>THIS
was &s;o evident too, that the General
ask'd him the Occa&s;ion of it; and the Man
an&s;wer'd frankly, it was not that he was
weary of the Service, only that he thought
him&s;elf not &s;o fit for it now, as before; but
if he could find out &s;ome Body <HI>that had
been robb'd lately,</HI> would certainly be
a fitter Man for it.</P>
<P>THE Moral of the Story is exactly to
my Purpo&s;e: Bold Adventures are for Men
of de&s;perate Fortunes, not for Men who&s;e
Fortunes are made; to make a Man rich and
great, adds nothing to his Vigour and Spirit
in the Bu&s;ine&s;s he is to undertake: Men
furni&s;h'd for great Attempts, mu&s;t be Men
who have great Expectations; when you
mount the Man, you di&s;mount his Courage;
when he is upon the Pinacle of his For|tunes,
he is pa&s;t the Pinacle of his enter|pri&s;ing
Spirit; he has nothing to do then, but
to keep him&s;elf where he is.</P>
<P>NOW, though this is a Scoundrel Spirit
in a Hero, 'tis yet a noble Spirit in a Trade&s;|man:
'Tis a Meanne&s;s hardly hone&s;t in a
General; but 'tis a Wi&s;dom and a Prudence
never enough to be commended in a Trade&s;|man:
Adventure &s;paringly if you would
<PB N="178" REF="190">
come out of Trade readily; the adventuring
Days are over, when the Trade&s;man &s;ees
the Door open, and is looking for his Way
out of Trade.</P>
<P>HE that runs into great Adventures after
he has enrich'd him&s;elf; &s;eems not to have
a true Notion of Trade; or to think it &s;o
much a Lottery as he ought to know it is.
One would think common Prudence &s;hould
make a deeper Impre&s;&s;ion upon a Man of
twenty or thirty Years Experience in Trade,
than to leave him in any Want of Advice
as to &s;uch a Thing as this.</P>
<P>HE that has traded, as I &s;ay, twenty or
thirty Years, mu&s;t have &s;een the Beginning
and End of many a fair Out&s;ide, mu&s;t have
&s;een many a plau&s;ible Propo&s;al vani&s;h into
Smoke, and end in the &s;ame Emptine&s;s
where it began: For him to dip in Air and
Vapour, and buy the Fancies of Projectors
and Undertakers with the &s;olid Sub&s;tance,
which he has laboured &s;o many Years for,
it has &s;omething &s;o prepo&s;terous in it, that
one would think no Man of ordinary Ex|perience
could come into it; and yet nothing
is more frequent than to &s;ee &s;uch Men who
have been cunning enough for all the World
before, drop into the weake&s;t Snares, and
be made Dupes of at la&s;t, by the meane&s;t
and mo&s;t Scoundrel Projector.</P>
<P>ON this Account, and becau&s;e of the
many Examples there are to be given where
<PB N="179" REF="191">
&s;uch Men have mi&s;carried: I &s;ay, on this
Account it is that I think this Advice is &s;ea|&s;onable;
and no Trade&s;man will think him|&s;elf
affronted, if from the frequent Examples
of Men ruined by &s;uch Mi&s;takes, I venture
to argue, that no Man is above the Caution,
no Man &s;o &s;ecure as not to want it.</P>
<P>NOR do I confine my&s;elf in this Part, to
the Trade&s;man's being drawn into Projects
and great Undertakings, tho' the&s;e have been
the capital Mi&s;chiefs which have overthrown
&s;o many, that I may well make it a Mark
of the whole.</P>
<P>BUT even in the Way of their own Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
how many rich Trade&s;men have I &s;een
fall at la&s;t by over-large Adventures within
the Compa&s;s of their proper Bu&s;ine&s;s? How
many were ruined at the Beginning of the
fir&s;t War, by undertaking to cloth the Ar|my?
Others by the Tran&s;port Service:
Some by furni&s;hing one Commodity, &s;ome
another; giving Credit to the Government,
under the Temptation of a great Price for
their Goods, and large Profits; at the &s;ame
Time being drawn in from one Article to
another, till they launched out not their
whole Stocks only, but to the utmo&s;t Ex|tent
of their Credit; and the Government
not paying in Time, the rich Trade&s;man
has been ruined, with his Talleys in his
Hand, and with his Accounts to &s;hew.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="192">
INNUMERABLE In&s;tances of Trade&s;men
ruined by the&s;e Things were to be &s;een in
tho&s;e Days, till Want of the publick Cre|dit
grew a terrible Calamity upon Trade;
and had not the Parliament re&s;tored that
Credit in the very critical Time, by making
good pa&s;t Deficiencies, and &s;hewing the Na|tion
where their grand Securities lay; that
the Parliament only was the Fund of Funds,
which could alone give Credit, and &s;up|port
it when given; by which the People
were encouraged to tru&s;t the Government,
without heavy Di&s;counts and large Ad|vancements
on the Rates of Goods &s;old to
them: I &s;ay, had not this been the Cafe,
the publick Credit mu&s;t entirely have &s;unk,
and innumerable Trade&s;men, even of the
fir&s;t Magnitude, have fallen with it under the
general Calamity.</P>
<P>ALL this is mentioned, without any par|ticular
Views in the Retro&s;pect, to let us
&s;ee how frequent it has been, and con&s;e|quently
&s;till may be, for the mo&s;t Topping
Trade&s;men, <HI>to u&s;e a Trading City Phra&s;e,</HI>
to be overthrown, and &s;ink under the or|dinary
Calamities of Bu&s;ine&s;s; not with &s;tand|ing
their Circum&s;tances have been otherwi&s;e
e&s;teemed (even by them&s;elves) to be above
the Reach of Di&s;a&s;ter: From hence I may
rea&s;onably argue, that the Trade&s;man has al|ways
Occa&s;ion to be wary and cautious; and
even the higher he advances, he &s;hould be
<PB N="181" REF="193">
&s;o far from abating, that he &s;hould increa&s;e
his Vigilance, by how much his Dangers
are greater from Adventures of greater Mag|nitude.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY
there &s;eems to be a Danger
&s;uch Men are more than others expos'd to;
I mean that of giving over-large Credit.
This is &s;ometimes unavoidable, but gene|rally
&s;peaking, &s;hould be guarded again&s;t as
one of the mo&s;t dangerous Con&s;equences of
a &s;trong Stock, and a powerful Credit.
How often have we found in &s;ome of our
late Commi&s;&s;ions of Bankrupt, that this or
that particular Man has come in a Creditor
to the Rate of ten, twelve, to fourteen
thou&s;and Pounds a Man? All tru&s;ted, as
we &s;ay, upon the Honour of a particular
Trade&s;man, who in the End &s;hews, that he
has no Honour, or perhaps Hone&s;ty at all;
and this without Bond or Security, upon the
ordinary Faith of a Book Debt, and with|out
any previous Con&s;ideration, more than
the mere Credit of the Man.</P>
<P>IF it were only that &s;uch a Man cannot
rea&s;onably run in Debt &s;o great a Sum,
if his own Circum&s;tances were good, yet
&s;uch a Credit does not &s;eem to corre&s;pond
with the u&s;ual Prudence of a Trade&s;man;
unle&s;s the Per&s;on tru&s;ting him has &s;uch a
clear Stock of his own, as not to value the
Lo&s;s of ten thou&s;and Pounds at a Time; and
how many of the&s;e are to be found?</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="194">
THIS is generally the Rea&s;on why, when
&s;uch a Trade&s;man &s;inks, he pulls down a
great many with him, as was hinted before;
as a great Tree, which falling among the
&s;maller Wood, cru&s;hes many &s;maller, and
otherwi&s;e promi&s;ing Plants with its Fall:
A Trade&s;man in full Credit, but ill rooted, and
rotten at Bottom, is really a terrible Article
in the Commonwealth of Trade; for Men
live with him as the People dwell upon
<HI>London-Bridge,</HI> without Fear, becau&s;e of
his long Standing.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That as the Trade&s;man is never too high

and no Condition is &s;o low or &s;o de&s;pica|ble

Diligence and Application recover it.</HEAD>
<P>_AS it was the encouraging Saying
of a wi&s;e Man relating to the ge|neral

A diligent Trade&s;man ought never to de|&s;pair.
And truly, Diligence is &s;o ab&s;olutely

without it he ought never to hope.</P>
<P>A MAN that will lie &s;till, &s;hould never

Diligence to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to De|liverance,
as Legs are to Progre&s;&s;ion. Ap|plication

&s;hall never be help'd: Heaven is always
able; but Heaven always requires us to be
a Means to our&s;elves, and he &s;eldom fails
concurring with tho&s;e Means; nay, it is &s;o
far Heaven is plea&s;ed to concur, that he
gives the very Honour of our Pro&s;perity
to our&s;elves, as if we were the Cau&s;es of it.
<HI>The diligent Hand makes rich.</HI> We know
'tis the Hand of Heaven that makes rich;
but the Text gives it to the Hand of Dili|gence,
as if it were to encourage the Man to
Application, and to beftir him&s;elf, heartily
promi&s;ing him both the Advantage and the
Credit of it, both the Honour and the Reward.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;poken to the Subject of Indu&s;|try
at large in the former Volume; but I
have not mentioned it as a Di&s;tre&s;s, and un|der
the Weight of Di&s;couragement, which
is what I now propo&s;e: A Trade&s;man &s;ets
up, falls, and &s;inks under Misfortunes, and
is undone: If he is a Man of no Spirit, in|dolent,
dead-hearted, and de&s;ponding, he
<PB N="184" REF="196">
is undone indeed, or, as we &s;ay, <HI>utterly un|done;</HI>
he de&s;pairs, faints, and lies in the
<HI>Mint,</HI> skulks under privileg'd Places, and
there his Creditors not complying, he &s;inks,
and dies: I have &s;een too many do thus
merely for want of Spirit and Courage to
work through Di&s;&s;ter.</P>
<P>BUT the vigorous re&s;tle&s;s Man of Dili|gence
never lies &s;till there; he &s;truggles,
he &s;trives with Creditors, to get free; if
that will not do, he gets abroad, turns him|&s;elf
round in the World, nay, I might &s;ay,
turns the World round with his Applica|tion:
If one Thing fails, he meets another;
if not in one Place, he &s;eeks out another;
he never gives out. I have known a Trade&s;|man
ri&s;e and fall, and ri&s;e and fall &s;ix or &s;e|ven
Times, and never give it over till at
la&s;t he has conquer'd the World, and ri&s;en
to &s;tand.</P>
<P>NOR &s;hould any Man upbraid a Trade&s;|man
for being unwearied in his Applica|tion;
nothing but unwearied Diligence and
invincible Courage can work a Man into
Bu&s;ine&s;s, who is once to&s;s'd out of it by the
Misfortunes of Trade: Trade is like a Rol|ling
Sea, that &s;ometimes one Wave wa&s;hes
a Man over Board, the next returning
Surge wa&s;hes him on Board again; as one
Breath of Wind puffs a Candle out, and
the next Puff blows it in again: A
Trade&s;man is never out of Hope to ri&s;e,
<PB N="185" REF="197">
till he is nail'd up in his Coffin, and &s;ix
Foot under Ground.</P>
<P>HE may be truly &s;aid to walk after he is
(civilly) dead; for he revives when the very
Name of him is, as it were, buried and
forgotten; if he is in this Part of the Globe,
or in another, 'tis all one; his Hand or
Head is always at Work, or perhaps both;
he rolls about the World like a Snowball,
always gathering more, always increa&s;ing,
till he comes to a Magnitude &s;ufficient to
exi&s;t of him&s;elf, and then he boldly &s;hews
him&s;elf in the &s;ame Orbit, in which he fir&s;t
&s;hin'd; for that is what he ever aims at.</P>
<P>BUT then 'tis ob&s;ervable of the poor bu|&s;tling
Creature, that whenever he thus ri&s;es
from his Di&s;a&s;ters, 'tis with the additional
Circum&s;tances of great Indu&s;try and Hone&s;|ty,
or with no Character or Reputation; for
the Re&s;toration of his Fortune and Figure
by Fraud and Knavery, is not, in my ca&s;t|ing
up the Account, any Recovery at all,
any more than if a Man &s;hould go to Sea,
and get a new E&s;tate by Rapine and Pyra|cy:
This I would call no ri&s;ing in the World,
no re&s;toring of Circum&s;tances; but he that
returns from the Captivity of his Fortunes,
with an Addition of Integrity to that of
Wealth, he returns with an Advantage
that wipes out the Infamy of his former Mi&s;|carriage,
and he &s;hines the brighter for the
dark Cloud that has &s;o long cover'd him.

THUS I have known a Trade&s;man come
back from an Ab&s;ence of twenty Years, a
long Bani&s;hment from his Shop, his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and his Family, and having met with
happier Turns abroad, has called his Cre|ditors
together, and though di&s;charged from
legal Demands, has thought him&s;elf obliged
to make equitable Satisfation of the Debt,
as much as if it had been hill owing in due
Form.</P>
<P>AND this Te&s;timony of the Integrity of
a Trade&s;man's Principle, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge
&s;tands upon Record again&s;t the com|mon
Scandal mentioned in our third Chap|ter,
namely, that a Trade&s;man cannot be
hone&s;t; that they are all Rogues; that they
not only are &s;o, but mu&s;t be &s;o; that it is
&s;o by the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of their Calling;
and that it cannot be otherwi&s;e. But by
this Gallantry of Principle in Trade, they
te&s;tify it was really at Bottom in all their
Actions, whatever the unhappy Exigences
of their Circum&s;tances brought them to the
ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of doing; for I mu&s;t
always be allowed to &s;ay, that ab&s;olute
Nece&s;&s;ity forces many a poor di&s;tre&s;&s;ed
Trade&s;man to do Things, which he is
a Penitent for to the la&s;t Hour of his
Life, and which his very Soul abhorr'd in
the very doing.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="201">
BUT how glorious a Te&s;timony is it to the
Fame and Character of the Man, when
through the many Difafters of a long un|happy
Life, he returns loaden with Ho|ne&s;ty,
and a good Con&s;cience, and without
any evident Force, pays the Widows and
the Orphans, who&s;e Families had fuffer'd
by him, and who had, as we may &s;ay, for|gotten
the antient Injury, and retain'd no
Hopes of &s;uch a Free-will offering, how|ever
due.</P>
<P>NOR mu&s;t I forget (Charity commands
it) to take notice of the many mourning
Penitents, who have the &s;ame Hone&s;ty,
but are not ble&s;t with the &s;ame Opportunity
of making Reparation of Wrongs, and Re|&s;titution
of Injuries done to others, who&s;e
Grief it is, that they cannot do it, and who
&s;incerely wi&s;h for the Occa&s;ion: I cannot
doubt but there are many &s;uch in the
World, and have always been &s;uch; and
that righteous Heaven accepts the &s;incere
Re&s;olution of &s;uch, for Peformance, though
they have not been ble&s;s'd with the Means
to perform it.</P>
<P>YET if I might be allow'd here to &s;peak
a Word to the di&s;treffed Trade&s;man in the
wor&s;t of his Circum&s;tances, that &s;avour'd
of any Thing &s;erious, it &s;hould be to urge
him to maintain the Principle entire; as
the be&s;t Means, at lea&s;t, to hope that he
&s;hall have the Occa&s;ion put into his Hand,
<PB N="188" REF="202">
not by way of meritorious Hone&s;ty, but
upon this Dependance, That as Heaven
alone can &s;upport the Principle, &s;o it may
be hoped he will one Time or other join
the Means and the End, and make them
able to do what they &s;inerely de&s;ire to do.</P>
<P>IT cannot be forgot, without Inju&s;tice to
the Ca&s;e before me, That I know no Cir|cum&s;tance
of Life gives a Man a greater
Te&s;timony to his Integrity than this of a
Trade&s;man; a Man in any other Capacity
&s;eems to be entirely without &s;o much as a
View or Pro&s;pect of it.</P>
<P>IN all other Di&s;a&s;ters of Life, once un|happy,
ever unfortunate; once branded
with Reproach, ever wearing that Mark of
Infamy: 'Tis the Trade&s;man's Felicity
only, that if he recovers his Di&s;a&s;ters, 'tis
in his Brea&s;t too to recover his Character,
to re&s;tore him&s;elf to the Opinion of good
Men, and &s;et him&s;elf right in their E&s;teem.</P>
<P>HOW many Gentlemen have I heard la|ment
their Difafter in this Circum&s;tance in
particular, that would &s;acrificed their Lives
to have recovered but the Name of an ho|ne&s;t
Man, which perhaps for one early Slip,
leaves a BUT in their Character, like a Bend
in their Coat of Arms, to be remember'd as
long as their Names are to be heard of.</P>
<P>WHAT Examples might we not give in
Hi&s;tory of this, particularly in two of the
greate&s;t Men of their Days; the fir&s;t of the
<PB N="189" REF="203">
good Lord <HI>Cranmer,</HI> Archbi&s;hop of <HI>Canter|bury,</HI>
who to &s;hew his Execration of that
one, and perhaps that only one ill Action
of his Life, with an inimitable Con&s;tancy
thru&s;t his right Arm into the Fire, and held
it there to the la&s;t Ga&s;p of Life, crying out,
<HI>Burn unworthy Right Hand,</HI> being the In|&s;trument
by which he denied his God, and
recanted his Religion.</P>
<P>THE other was the truly great Man, the Lord
<HI>Bacon,</HI> who being overcome by the Temp|tation
of Avarice, fell once into the Crime of
Corruption in Ju&s;tice, &s;unk under the Infa|my
and Mi&s;ery of it, and could never, by the
greate&s;t Te&s;timonies of Penitence, and of a
real Grief for the Fact, recover his Charac|ter;
and the Weight of that particular Thing
broke his Heart.</P>
<P>I might give In&s;tances nearer Home, and
in Ca&s;es &s;ome greater, &s;ome le&s;s, tho' none
more worthy our Mention. But to bring
it all to our Purpo&s;e: The Trade&s;man, how|ever
mi&s;erable in his Fall, however &s;canda|lous
in the Circum&s;tance of it, however
great the Infamy, and with whatever Ag|gravations
his Ruin has been, yet if once
he appears with a generous Hone&s;ty to di&s;|charge
his old Obligations, and pay off the
Debts contracted in his Di&s;tre&s;s, he becomes
the Darling, even of Fame it &s;elf; he gains
an Applau&s;e, infinitely &s;uperior to all the
Reproach he &s;uffer'd; he has ample Amends
<PB N="190" REF="204">
made him by the World, in a Manner, &s;o
very much to his Advantage, that I know
no Ca&s;e that comes up to it.</P>
<P>Nay, that which &s;eems to requite the Man,
and make his very Memory Satisfaction for all
the unworthy Bla&s;ts it had before ca&s;t upon
his Reputation, and that not only in kind,
but with Intere&s;t, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is
ever paying the Debt, for it has never done
with it; the Man's Name is never men|tioned,
but the Remembrance of this Pattern
of his Hone&s;ty is annex'd, as if it were an Ap|pendix
to his Hi&s;tory; 'tis a Debt due to
his Memory paid with Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>I cannot but &s;ay this is a particular En|couragement
to a Trade&s;man to be hone&s;t,
becau&s;e whenever he plea&s;es to be &s;o, all his
trading Mi&s;carriages are forgotten, all his
fal&s;e Steps are buried in that one Action of In|tegrity,
and he is call'd an hone&s;t Man, nay,
the hone&s;te&s;t of hone&s;t Men, ever after; with|out
&s;o much as one Reflection of Di&s;honour
upon the wor&s;t of his pa&s;t Life: He is wa&s;h'd
clean from every Spot; he is clearer than an
Innocent, that never offended; for he is &s;po|ken
of with &s;uch an Addition of Honour to
his Character, that a &s;imple Life of Hone&s;ty,
though in the highe&s;t Degree &s;eldom attains
to.</P>
<P>TO fall, is common to all Mankind; to
fall and ri&s;e, is a Particular that few Men
arrive to, and no Man &s;o ea&s;y or &s;o often
<PB N="191" REF="205">
as the Trade&s;man; but to fall into the very
Dirt of Scandal and Reproach, and ri&s;e with
Reputation; to fall with Infamy, and ri&s;e
with Applau&s;e; to fall dete&s;ted, and ri&s;e
care&s;&s;ed and embraced by all Mankind; this
I think is a kind of Peculiar to the Trade&s;|man;
nay, to the unhappy unfortunate
Trade&s;man, who by this one Turn of his
Affairs, is lifted out of the Mire into a Sta|tion
of Life, infinitely &s;uperior to the be&s;t
Condition he was ever in before.</P>
<P>AND this abundantly &s;upports the Title
of this Chapter, namely, that a Trade&s;man
is never too low to ri&s;e: But let the Reader
of this Part take this with him as he goes,
that it mu&s;t be attended &s;till with a previous
Hone&s;ty, or el&s;e the other Part follows al&s;o,
of which I have &s;poken already, That he is
never too high to fall.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That a Trade&s;man, though &s;tanding him&s;elf
&s;ecure, &s;hould have a Charitable Concern
for tho&s;e who mi&s;carry, at lea&s;t, &s;hould not
in&s;ult and rejoice at their Calamity.</HEAD>
<P>_IF it would not offend the flouri&s;hing
Trade&s;man too much, I might here
put in a Caution for his U&s;e; and
<PB N="192" REF="206">
I think 'tis the more &s;ea&s;onable here, becau&s;e
I too often find that Trade&s;men are apt to
be the forwarde&s;t in the Offence, I mean,
that of triumphing in the Misfortunes, and
over the Per&s;ons of their Neighbours in Di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>NOR is it &s;ufficient to triumph, as I &s;ay,
in their Misfortunes, but they generally are
the forwarde&s;t to reproach their Names, en|ter
into the Particulars of their Conduct, and
heap Scandal upon them as well as Shame.</P>
<P>IT is true, that 'tis hard for a Trade&s;man
to fall, but that &s;ome Charge may lie again&s;t
his Morals, &s;ome Reproach may be rais'd
upon his Management; and no Man is &s;o
capable of &s;eeing into this Part, as his Neigh|bour
Trade&s;man. I have touch'd at &s;ome
of tho&s;e in the former Volume, &s;uch as
breaking his Word in Appointments of Pay|ment,
which depending upon other Appoint|ments,
may be unavoidable, and many other
Ca&s;es, wherein it mu&s;t be &s;aid for the poor
Trade&s;man, that the be&s;t Man that ever
broke or fail'd in Trade, has been obliged
to do tho&s;e Things in his Di&s;tre&s;s, which at
other Times his very Soul abhorred, and
which he looks back upon with the utmo&s;t
Regret and Self|eproach.</P>
<P>AND as I &s;aid, the be&s;t Trade&s;man that
ever failed, may do thus; &s;o I mu&s;t add, the
better the Trade&s;man is, the more this Reflec|tion
afflicts him, when he looks back upon
<PB N="193" REF="207">
tho&s;e Things: And as we are directed in the
Lord's Prayer to &s;ay, <HI>Deliver us from
Evil</HI> &s;o a poor declining, and yet con&s;cien|tious
Trade&s;man ought to &s;ay, <HI>Deliver us</HI>
from the <HI>horrid Nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of doing <HI>Evil.</HI>
Indeed, it may be called a Nece&s;&s;ity of do|ing
Evil; for &s;uch it is to the Trade&s;man,
and it is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity, unavoidable
to him; he mu&s;t do the&s;e Things, or &s;ink
into De&s;truction immediately.</P>
<P>IT is true, &s;trictly &s;peaking, he ought to
&s;ink, he ought to peri&s;h, rather than do it:
When he has his Neighbour's Bread in his
keeping, he ought to &s;tarve, and &s;ee Wife and
Children &s;tarve and peri&s;h, rather than touch
it; but where is the Man? or, who is the Man
that can re&s;i&s;t the ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity? and
therefore the wi&s;e Prayer of <HI>Agar</HI> is very
&s;ignificant, <HI>Give me not Poverty, le&s;t I
&s;teal, Prov. xxx.</HI> 9. The Meaning is plain,
Keep me from Poverty; for I fear if I am
di&s;tre&s;s'd, I &s;hould not be hone&s;t.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the very Text it&s;elf &s;peaks, tho'
not in favour of the Crime, yet in great
Compa&s;&s;ion and Pity for the Criminal Men:
<HI>Do not de&s;pi&s;e a Thief that &s;teals to &s;atis&s;fy
his Hunger,</HI> Prov. vi. 30. Not that the
Text encourages The&s;t on any Account;
but 'tis evidently implied, that the Nece&s;|&s;ity
is too great to be &s;upported; that Hun|ger
will make Men turn Thieves. And let
human Nature &s;peak for it&s;elf: Will the
<PB N="194" REF="208">
hone&s;te&s;t Man alive peri&s;h for Hunger, and
not touch his Neighbours Loaf, when it is
in his keeping? I tell you, he will not eat
his Neighbour's Loaf only, but eat his
Neighbour him&s;elf, ay, and crave a Ble&s;|&s;ing
to the Food too, as has been known to
be the Ca&s;e in many Di&s;tre&s;&s;es that have hap|pen'd
in the World.</P>
<Q><P>DISTRESS is an Article which human Na|ture
is not equal to.</P>
<P>TEN Men are in a Boat at Sea; they
have no Food to eat, no Water to
drink: Hunger is raging: One of them,
a good Man, abhors an evil Action;
and goes on till he is in the utmo&s;t A|gony;
he dares not kill him&s;elf, that
is Self-Murder, and leaves no Room
for Repentance.</P>
<P>THE Extremity increa&s;es, he grows ra|venous,
and his Eye is evil again&s;t his
Neighbour's Life; they fall upon one,
and kill and devour him, and yet pe|ri&s;h;
he lies down, and mourns with the
Horror, and wi&s;hes for Death; but the
Rage of Hunger increa&s;ing, they draw
Lots for Life, and do the &s;ame Thing
again.</P></Q>
<P>THE poor Trade&s;man's Ca&s;e is the &s;ame
in Degree: He has not his Neighbour in|deed
with him in the Boat, but he has his
<PB N="195" REF="209">
Neighbour's Bread with him, that is to &s;ay,
his Neighbour's Stock, his Goods, or his
Money, are embarked with him, and he de|vours
them; that is to &s;ay, he makes u&s;e of
them in his Di&s;tre&s;s to relieve him&s;elf, per|haps
to keep him&s;elf from an Arre&s;t and a
Jail, or to bring him&s;elf out of a Pri&s;on,
when he is put in, which is &s;till wor&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE are the heavy Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the
Trade&s;man, overwhelm'd with the Difficul|ties
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and this is really to &s;a|tisfy
his Soul, as the Scripture expre&s;&s;es it,
when he is hungry; and this, with the &s;ame
Text, calls for our Pity, not our Reproach.</P>
<P>IT is upon that Account I mention it;
not that I ju&s;tify the Trade&s;man acting thus,
and think, as I have already &s;aid, &s;uch a
Trade&s;man &s;hould chu&s;e to &s;hut up, and
call his People together, before it comes to
that Length. But I am not talking to him
now, but to his rich flouri&s;hing Neighbour:
When I directed my Speech to the Trade&s;|man
him&s;elf, I gave him &s;uch Advice as I
think was &s;uitable to his Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT now I &s;peak to the rich Trade&s;man,
that looks on with Smiles upon the Cala|mity
of his Neighbour; that triumphs over
his Di&s;a&s;ter, and loads him with Reproaches,
adding Sorrow to the Afflicted, and Grief
to the Mi&s;erable: To &s;uch I mu&s;t &s;ay, in
the Words of the Text, though meant of
another Kind of Standing, <HI>Let him that
<PB N="196" REF="210">
thinketh he &s;tandeth, take heed le&s;t he fall,</HI>
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 12. and 'tis ob&s;ervable, the Cau|tion
in the Text is not to him <HI>that &s;tandeth,</HI>
but him <HI>that thinketh he &s;tandeth;</HI> intima|ting,
that Men may think them&s;elves &s;afe,
when they are not &s;o, and may but think
they &s;tand.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;o in Religion, much more is it
&s;o in Trade: Here Men may really think
they &s;tand, and that they are pa&s;t Danger,
and many Times are in &s;uch Circum&s;tances
as would almo&s;t ju&s;tify any Body's thinking
&s;o; and were their Thoughts bounded, and
their Ambition duly limited, they might be
&s;aid to be out of Danger; but as I have
&s;aid, that a Trade&s;man is never out of Dan|ger
till he is out of Trade, &s;o he is never
out of Danger till his De&s;ires of having more
are limited; he is never too high to fall, till
he is once &s;o high as to aim no higher.</P>
<P>AMBITION is Avarice in a Trade&s;man;
in a Courtier it is to be in great Po&s;ts; in
a Soldier to be in great Command; but in
a Trade&s;man it is to have a great E&s;tate: It
is indeed Covetou&s;ne&s;s in them all, and
Pride in them all; &s;o we count them capital
Vices among all; but the End is the &s;ame,
tho' the different Views differ with the Men.
In &s;hort, the Courtier's Avarice is to be great
in State and in Figure; and the Trade&s;man's
Ambition is to be rich in his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and as
'tis in one, &s;o 'tis in both; while the Ambition,
<PB N="197" REF="211">
the Avarice remains, the Trade&s;man is
never out of Danger any more than the
State&s;man.</P>
<P>THE Inference is the &s;ame as before: If
not out of Danger of falling your&s;elf, take
heed then, how you carry it to tho&s;e that do
fall: To the afflicted Trade&s;man Pity &s;hould
be &s;hewn, as the Scripture &s;ays, <HI>To him that
is afflicted Pity &s;hould be &s;hewn by his Friend.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Method now is to trample upon,
and triumph over the Afflictions of the
poor overwhelm'd Trade&s;man; and that by
his Neighbour Trade&s;man, who perhaps is
not many Year after him, nor long behind
him in the &s;ame Calamity.</P>
<P>NOR does this trampling on his Di&s;a&s;ter
con&s;i&s;t only in the Triumph of the Tongue,
adding In&s;ults and Reproaches to his Cala|mity;
but it is a formal Charge or Accu&s;a|tion
again&s;t his Morals; loading him with
Scandal, and indeed is an Indictment again&s;t
him in Form; which the Trade&s;man ought
not to do, unle&s;s he can prove the Facts,
and unle&s;s he will appear before the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
of Bankrupt, or in &s;ome Court
of Ju&s;tice, and legally pro&s;ecute the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THIS makes me &s;peak it with the more
Earne&s;tne&s;s, that the rich Trade&s;man, or
&s;uppo&s;edly &s;tanding Trade&s;man, &s;hould <HI>take
heed le&s;t he fall;</HI> that is, in the Sen&s;e of the
pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, &s;hould act as if he was not &s;ure,
as no Trade&s;man is, that he &s;hall not fall;
<PB N="198" REF="212">
he &s;hould act with Prudence, with Mode&s;ty,
and with Charity.</P>
<P>AND this the more, becau&s;e as that he
is not &s;ure he <HI>&s;hall not fall,</HI> &s;o is not &s;ure
the Trade&s;man, poor and di&s;courag'd, &s;unk
and demoli&s;h'd as he is, &s;hall not yet ri&s;e
again. That Text in <HI>Micah,</HI> however
meant in and applied to another Ca&s;e, may
be ju&s;tly applied to this of the Trade&s;man,
<HI>Micah</HI> vii. 8. <HI>Rejoice not again&s;t me, O
mine Enemy, when I fall; I &s;hall ari&s;e,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>NO Men ri&s;e oftner out of the deepe&s;t
Di&s;tre&s;&s;es than the ruin'd Trade&s;men of this
particular Nation: 'Tis ob&s;ervable that it is
not &s;o ea&s;y to recover the ruin'd Fortunes
of a Trade&s;men in other Nations, as it is
of this: The Rea&s;ons for that are, not that
the Trade&s;inen in this Nation are le&s;s dili|gent
and indefatigable than in other Coun|tries;
I wi&s;h I could &s;ay it was &s;o; nay, I
wi&s;h I could &s;ay it was not ju&s;t the contra|ry;
but I believe it to be owing to the
great Flux of Bu&s;ine&s;s which is carried on
here; which is certainly greater in <HI>Eng|land</HI>
than in any other Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI>
or in the whole World; and we &s;hall &s;ee
more into that Part when the Magnitude of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> or <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Commerce comes to
be &s;poken of.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;man is a kind of
<HI>Phooenix,</HI> who often ri&s;es out of his own
<PB N="199" REF="213">
A&s;hes, and makes the Ruin of his Fortunes
be a firm Foundation to build his Recove|ry:
Indeed there is &s;omething in the fir&s;t
Ruin of a Trade&s;man, that furni&s;hes him
effectually to &s;tand the firmer for the Time
to come.</P>
<P>NO Man is &s;o well caution'd again&s;t Di|&s;a&s;ters,
&s;o well warn'd again&s;t Mi&s;chief of
all Kinds, &s;o well fortified again&s;t fal&s;e
Mea&s;ures, as a ruin'd Trade&s;man; he knows
what has once blown him up; If it was
high Living before, he goes on the more
frugally now: If it was hard Drinking before,
he lives temperately now: If it was keeping
Company before, he keeps his Shop now:
And by the&s;e new Mea&s;ures he conquers
fir&s;t him&s;elf, and then all his Misfortunes;
he becomes not only a new Man, but a
new Trade&s;man; makes a new Figure in
the World, and all his former Mi&s;takes are
forgotten: He is as if he had never been
otherwi&s;e: The World is reconcil'd to him
in a Moment: If his former Circum&s;tances
are recover'd, his Reputation is doubled;
and I know no Man that &s;inks with greater
Hope, and ri&s;es again with greater Advan|tage
than the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade&s;man.</P>
<P>THIS, if there was nothing el&s;e in it,
&s;hould make their Neighbour Trade&s;man
cautious how they ill u&s;e them in their Mi&s;|fortunes
and Afflictions, and how they tri|umph
and trample over them, as if they
<PB N="200" REF="214">
were like Trees twice dead, and pluck'd up
by the Roots.</P>
<P>HOW ill does it look upon a Neighbour
Trade&s;man to rejoice over the Mi&s;carriage
of a poor Trade&s;man his Neighbour, or perhaps
his Debtor? I &s;ay, how ill does it look upon
him when the poor Trade&s;man, working
through his Difficulties, comes to &s;et up
again ju&s;t at his Door, and he &s;ees the Cu&s;|tomers
flock to his Shop, and that he ri&s;es
in Credit, in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in Stock?</P>
<P>BUT to come back to the poor, broken,
di&s;located, comfortle&s;s, Trade&s;man, that has
fallen under his Misfortunes, as I &s;aid to
him before; <HI>Nil De&s;perandum;</HI> let him
never de&s;pair, never give out, never abate
his Diligence: If one Thing will not do,
try another; be always attempting, always
hoping; and 'tis on this Account I men|tion
it; when I &s;ay he &s;hould de&s;pair of
nothing, it is to introduce this Part, <HI>viz,</HI>
always hoping.</P>
<P>HOPE is the &s;tronge&s;t Spur to Diligence;
he that works without Hope will never
hold it long: It is true, 'tis the Fault of
&s;ome Men, that they are always hoping,
even when it is groundle&s;s, and con&s;equent|ly
&s;ruitle&s;s; they hope with a cau&s;ele&s;s
Expectation; hope without Views; are full
of Expectations from Emptine&s;s and Air;
and this is the Rea&s;on, that if they are full
of any Thing, it is of Di&s;appointment.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="215">
How &s;hould the&s;e Men fail of Di&s;ap|pointments,
who anticipate their own Sor|rows,
by fixing their Hopes upon incapable
Objects. This is, as when a Ship is &s;inking to
take hold of an Anchor, or of one of the
great Guns to get to Shore upon, in&s;tead of
a &s;pare Top|a&s;t,
or a &s;pare Yard; the
latter may float the Man to the Land, the
former will &s;ink him directly to the Bot|tom.</P>
<P>AS long as the Trade&s;man has any Hope,
&s;o long he will be &s;ure to &s;truggle with his
Misfortunes; and as long as he can &s;truggle,
he may hope: A Trade&s;man is the be&s;t fit|ted
to &s;truggle with Di&s;a&s;ters of any Part
of Mankind: The Soldier, indeed, takes up
a Mankind: The Soldier, indeed, takes up
a Musket, or gets a Commi&s;&s;ion, and ha|ving
a hundred thou&s;and to one Odds again&s;t
him, is knock'd on the Head, or ri&s;es to
&s;omething: The Scholar, got into Misfor|tune,
is good for ju&s;t nothing, but to &s;crib|ble
for Bread; write Poems, and as Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>To daub the Vile, and compliment the Great.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Trade&s;man can live in any
Part of the World; give him but Liberty,
and &s;omething to begin with, he will not
fail to engage in &s;omething or other that
may turn to Account. How many Trade&s;|men,
after being ruin'd in <HI>England,</HI> have
<PB N="202" REF="216">
gone to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> at the mean Salary
of 20<HI>l.</HI> a Year, and have come home with
as many Thou&s;ands in their Pockets? How
many have gone to other of our Colonies
empty, in the Nature of Servants, and are
now re&s;ident there, in the Quality of con&s;ide|rable
Planters, or come home again with E&s;|tates.</P>
<P>NO People in the World recover the
mo&s;t de&s;perate and hopele&s;s Circum&s;tances, or
work through the mo&s;t inextricable Difficul|ties
like them.</P>
<P>IF the Trade&s;man is never to de&s;pair of
his own Circum&s;tances, then we &s;hould ne|ver
give him up for lo&s;t, and u&s;e him as if
he was dead, and never to ri&s;e: As he is
the mo&s;t likely to ri&s;e again when he falls,
&s;o we have the lea&s;t Rea&s;on to think him
lo&s;t when we &s;ee him down: The Advice,
then, is to him that thinketh he &s;tandeth, to
u&s;e tenderly tho&s;e that fall.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Fact: The poor Di&s;|tre&s;s'd
Trade&s;man has been, as others be|fore
him have been, oblig'd to do many
Things, which otherwi&s;e he would not
have done; he has been oblig'd to run in
Debt when he would not; to take Money
when he could not refund it; to touch
Tru&s;ts committed to him; to promi&s;e Pay|ment,
and break Promi&s;es: And what is the
Meaning of all this? His Di&s;tre&s;s has driven
<PB N="203" REF="217">
him to it: The rich Man upbraids him with
it, and &s;ays, he never did thus and thus.</P>
<P>YOU never did &s;o: Was you ever tried?
Was you ever di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to make Payment,
and did not promi&s;e without a Pro&s;pect?
Was you ever in Pri&s;on, and would not
make u&s;e of another Man's Money entru&s;t|ed
with you, to fetch you out?</P>
<P>HE is the hone&s;t Man that has &s;tood the
Te&s;t of the ordinary and extraordinary
Que&s;tion in that Ca&s;e; who can &s;ay he has
&s;tarved rather than touch his Neighbour's
Loaf: 'Tis he that can pay, and will not,
that is the Knave; but for him that would
pay, and cannot, he may be as hone&s;t as he
that does pay becau&s;e he can.</P>
<P>WHEN the poor Broken Trade&s;man fir&s;t
fails, he bears all the&s;e Reproaches, that's
true; but when he ri&s;es again, and pays
every Man punctually again, not needing
to do it, having been legally di&s;charged,
then he &s;hines brighter than before, and ob|tains
a brighter Character than he that never
fail'd at all.</P>
<P>AS then the Fortunes of the rich Trade&s;|man
are never known till he is dead, &s;o the
Fate of the Bankrupt is not concluded while
he is alive; his Principles are not fully
&s;hewn, and therefore his Actions &s;hould not
be cen&s;ur'd till his Bottom is wound off, till
he has done with the World, and the World
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="218">
LET us look at both the Trade&s;men, the
low and the high: Their Characters are
known by the Conclu&s;ion, and not before;
as I have &s;aid above. Death only deter|mines
their Characters; the poor diligent
Trade&s;man, recovering from his Misfortunes
and &s;hewing his Hone&s;ty in the faire&s;t
Manner, yet may fail again; he may meet
with Di&s;a&s;ters again, ay, and again; and
we often &s;ee Men fail three Times over,
and more; and yet go to their Graves, as
we may, in their own Coaches, pick up
their Fortunes at la&s;t, and die rich.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we have &s;een flou|ri&s;hing
Trade&s;men carry it on with a full
Credit, and a great Stroke of Bu&s;ine&s;s to
the la&s;t, and when they have died, not leave
enough to bury them, nay, not enough to
pay five Shillings in the Pound: So various,
&s;o uncertain is the Scene of a Trade&s;man's
Life: And hence it came to be a proverbial
Saying, <HI>That no Man knows what a Trade&s;
man is till he is dead.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT then can the Trade&s;man &s;ay for
in&s;ulting the Reputation of an unfortunate
Brother? Let his own Bottom be wound
up fir&s;t, and then he may &s;peak with the
more A&s;&s;urance; for a Trade&s;man neither
knows him&s;elf, or is known, till his Bottom
is wound off; and it greatly reproaches his
own Chararcter to have him triumph over
the Di&s;a&s;ters of another.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219">
THE antient Standard Trade&s;man has
al&s;o &s;omething to regard relating to his own
Reputation at the Clo&s;e of his trading Days.</P>
<P>I have di&s;tingui&s;h'd in the Character of a
Trade&s;man, between Credit and Reputation,
and the Di&s;tinction is very ju&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Credit of a Trade&s;man con&s;i&s;ts in
his punctual Payment of his Bills, and De|mands
of every Kind; and this Credit may
be untainted and &s;potle&s;s as to Trade, when
he may have no Reputation, as a Man of
Worth, a Man of Value, or as to his Morals,
or his per&s;onal and relative Conduct in his
Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man may have a thorough Credit
for Payment; that Men would tru&s;t him for
any Sum; that when Bills were accepted,
they are paid to a Day, to a Tittle; and
yet take him in his other Part, even of his
Dealings, he has no Reputation; that he
will bite every Man he can, oppre&s;s the
Poor in his Bargains; take all Advantages
in Trade; that he will do nothing but what
he may be forc'd to, nothing but what he
can't help: The u&s;ual Saying of &s;uch a
Man is, <HI>That he is an hone&s;t Man with
good looking to; that he will be always
hone&s;t when 'tis for his own Intere&s;t:</HI> And
indeed 'tis well among &s;ome People, if
&s;o much as that could be gained of them.

BUT he is the Trade&s;man of Credit and
Reputation, who is known to be a fair and
generous Trade&s;man, that will own a ver|bal
Bargain, and not prevaricate and deny
Facts, becau&s;e they are not to be &s;hewn
under Hand and Seal; that when he is char|ged
upon his Word, will acknowledge the
Promi&s;e, will perform the Condition, and
will not take the Advantage to defraud his
Dealers on frivolous Pretences, and find
Holes to creep out to evade Contracts not
to his Mind, and break his Word to &s;ave
his Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE'S many a Trade&s;man, who&s;e
Credit will pa&s;s in Trade, or upon <HI>Ex|change,</HI>
for ten thou&s;and Pound, who yet
has the Name of a Rogue and a Knave in
his ordinary Dealing, and will die, at lea&s;t
die out of Trade, bla&s;ted and branded with
Infamy, as an unfair Dealer, as a Man of
no Probity, no Character, and that would
&s;eldom do a fair Thing.</P>
<P>CREDIT is &s;upported by a good Fund of
Money; and he &s;hall always be tru&s;ted in
Trade that pays punctually.</P>
<P>BUT Reputation is &s;upported by Hone&s;|ty,
by fair, and punctual, and honourable
Dealings; by a generous clean Behaviour
in Trade, and by acting upon all Occa&s;ions
as an hone&s;t Man, though without Com|pul&s;ion,
and without Nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="223">
To bring this home to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e;
the rich over|rown
Trade&s;man may have
the fir&s;t of the&s;e; his Credit may be good
and untouch'd, no Man doubts his Ability;
but his Reputation may be good for no|thing;
he may be an immoral Man, an un|ju&s;t,
a cozening, cheating Knave at the
Bottom, and that in Trade too, and yet his
Credit for Payment be perfectly good.</P>
<P>HE may be branded with over reaching,
circumventing,
trapaning his Neighbours,
taking all Advantages, ju&s;t or unju&s;t, not
valuing his Word, or being to be bound by
any Thing but Hand and Seal; in a Word,
he may be a compleat Knave, and yet, as
to his punctual Payment, be as compleat a
Trade&s;man as can be de&s;ir'd.</P>
<P>AND what is the Reputation of &s;uch a Man
good for? Let him be as rich as a <HI>Ty&s;&s;on,</HI>
or a <HI>Cutler,</HI> if he has not the Character of
an hone&s;t Trade&s;man, as well as &s;ub&s;tan|tial
Trade&s;man, what is it good for? and
of what Value is &s;uch a Man in the Place
where he dwells? He dies with the Re|proaches
of the Rich, and with the Cur&s;es
of the Poor.</P>
<P>NOR indeed is it rightly to be called Ho|ne&s;ty,
that a Trade&s;man pays his Bills cur|rently,
that he pays Ready Money for
what he buys, or, to put it into Trade&s;|mens
Words, that he buys all for Ready
Money: All this he may do without one
<PB N="208" REF="224">
Grain of Principle; when his Bills are ac|cepted,
he mu&s;t pay them to &s;ave his Cre|dit,
or to avoid Force; in a Word, he is in
all that, only hone&s;t, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI> becau&s;e he
can't help it.</P>
<P>HE buys for Ready Money, that is, be|cau&s;e
he would buy cheaper than ordinary;
and he pays Ready Money becau&s;e he buys
&s;o, and mu&s;t do it, or el&s;e no Man will &s;ell
Goods to him at a Readymoney
Price ano|ther
Time.</P>
<P>IN a word, he buys his Credit by the&s;e
Things, and he is hone&s;t becau&s;e he cannot
help it; as many Men are not Thieves only
for fear of the Gallows; and as another Pro|verb
&s;ays, though profanely, <HI>That</HI> God
<HI>would have few Servants if the</HI> Devil
<HI>were dead;</HI> but there is not one Dram of
Principle in all this: It is far from de&s;er|ving
&s;o much as the Name of Hone&s;ty; and
the Trade&s;man may do this, and yet be as
great a K&mdash;as any walks the <HI>Exchange,</HI>
or that opens a Shop in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>HONESTY is quite another Thing: A tru|ly
hone&s;t Trade&s;man would be &s;o if no
Body was Witne&s;s to it; would keep his
Word to a Tittle, though no Body heard
him promi&s;e: He &s;corns to undermine or
circumvent his Neighbour, but acts the
friendly Part to the Rich, and the generous
Part to the Poor; oppre&s;&s;es no Man, grinds
no Man, takes no unju&s;t Advantages again&s;t
<PB N="209" REF="225">
any Man, but witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him&s;elf, as
well as for him&s;elf, upon all Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THIS Di&s;tinction between Credit and Re|putation,
as it is very needful in Trade, &s;o 'tis
very ju&s;t to the Trade&s;men; for many Men
go to their Graves with the ju&s;t Character
of Knave, di&s;hone&s;t, unju&s;t, who yet die
in full Credit, as Trade&s;men, and leave im|men&s;e
Wealth behind them. I could name
&s;ome Trade&s;men in <HI>London,</HI> who have died
worth a hundred thou&s;and Pounds in E&s;tate,
who could not with all the Money have
purcha&s;ed their Reputation of hone&s;t Men,
no, nor with ten Times the Money.</P>
<P>REPUTATION is not to be purchas'd by
Money; 'tis rais'd by Probity, and Prudence
of Conduct, and by that only; a long Series
of generous and ju&s;t Dealings, open Evidences
of an Integrity of Mind, the&s;e bear Wit|ne&s;s
to them&s;elves, and give a Character.</P>
<P>CREDIT, indeed, is gain'd by Money:
When we want to credit a Man in Trade, we
ask, is he able? is he rich? if you are once
&s;atisfied of the Ability, you are &s;atisfied to
tru&s;t the Man, and &s;ell your Goods; for
&s;ays the Trade&s;man &s;elling, <HI>Let him but
buy; if he is able, I'll make him willing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How much better is Reputation than this
Credit? I mean to the Man, as a Man, and
as a Chri&s;tian: It mu&s;t be acknowledged,
as the Times go now, it will not go &s;o far
in Trade as the Credit:</HI> Let the Man be
<PB N="210" REF="226">
the greate&s;t Sharper and Cheat in the City,
if he is but able, we'll take his Bills, tru&s;t
him with our Goods, and hazard with him
upon all Adventures, becau&s;e we depend
upon the Law, as above, to make him wil|ling.</P>
<P>BUT what imports his Hone&s;ty to us
in Trade; if the Man be not able, his
Hone&s;ty may make us value him, but 'tis
his Ability that makes us tru&s;t him, and
trade with him. <HI>And this, I doubt not,
makes &s;o many Trade&s;men (too many in|deed)
value their Credit &s;o much above
their Con&s;cience; of which I had rather &s;ay
nothing than &s;peak all the Truth.</HI></P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">That the rich Trade&s;man leaving off, &s;hould

Peace, and go off in a Calm, with the
good Word of the Rich, and the Ble&s;|&s;ings
of the Poor, and whatever he was
before, be well &s;poken of at la&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>_I Bring all this back to the antient
&s;ub&s;tantial Trade&s;man, that talks
of leaving off, and being grown
rich, begins to flack his Hand in
<PB N="211" REF="227">
Bu&s;ine&s;s; is, as it were, &s;atisfied with what
he has, and tired with the Hurry of the
World: It cannot but be to the Advantage
of this Trade&s;man to come off clean, to
wind up the Bottom well, without any
tangled Skeins behind; to leave no Broils
upon the Hands of his Succe&s;&s;ors in Trade,
and no Slurs upon his Reputation that
gave it over.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a Trade&s;man leaving off,
is not under the &s;ame ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of
guarding him&s;elf, to rai&s;e a Credit, and &s;up|port
his Character for the Support of his
Bu&s;ine&s;s; but 'tis &s;till of &s;ome Weight to
a Trade&s;man, to maintain the Reputation
which he had, and to go off well, that he
may not go out of Bu&s;ine&s;, as &s;ome go out
of the World, like the Snuff of a Candle,
with a Smoke and a Stink.</P>
<P>IF he has been a cunning, &s;harping, bi|ting,
overreaching
Wretch; if he has put
<HI>Tork&s;hire</HI> upon the World all his Days, and
&s;et up Craft for Hone&s;ty, 'tis Time to leave
it off at la&s;t, and, if he can, to recover
him&s;elf, and get a better Name to go off
the Stage with; as the wor&s;t Malefactors,
repent when they come to the Gallows, and
gain our Pity at la&s;t by their Penitence, if
they could not by their Crime; &s;o the mo&s;t
unfair de&s;igning rich Trade&s;man may (at
the Clo&s;e) do &s;ome hand&s;ome Things to re|&s;tore
his good Name, and reconcile the
<PB N="212" REF="228">
common Opinion to him at his going off;
and 'tis better late than never, like the Peo|ple
in &s;ome Countries, who cheat and lye,
oppre&s;s, deceive, and run through a long
Life of &s;candalous Inju&s;tice in their Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and then, with the Money they have
&s;crew'd out of the Poor, build an Ho&s;pital,
and &s;ettle Revenues and Ma&s;&s;es to hire
Prayers to be &s;aid for them.</P>
<P>BUT I would &s;uppo&s;e our Trade&s;man
not &s;o bad as that; I am not a rating him
with the wor&s;t neither, but &s;uppo&s;e him to
be a Man that, it may be, has been a little
&s;harp and hard, and the World has found
fault with him; he has not &s;o good a Name
as &s;ome of his Neighbours in his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and now he is drawing out: I would re|commend
it to &s;uch a Trade&s;man, I &s;ay, to
come off clean, pay every Man hand&s;omely,
wrangle with no Body, bring no conte&s;ted
Accounts, no Quarrels, no Suits at Law
along with him; but, as he pretends, to &s;it
down ea&s;y, &s;o I would advi&s;e him to &s;it
down &s;o, as to make every Body ea&s;y with
him.</P>
<P>A Man may be ea&s;y him&s;elf, in oppre&s;|&s;ing
and wronging every Body el&s;e, and
going off with the Spoils of the Poor; but
if he would have the World be ea&s;y too, he
mu&s;t do every Thing clean and fair by
them at la&s;t, as well as by him&s;elf: A Man
that leaves his Bu&s;ine&s;s with the Reproach
<PB N="213" REF="229">
of a thou&s;and little Quarrels about his Ears,
rather hides him&s;elf from the World, than
&s;its down to enjoy it: All the Trade&s;man's
Accounts &s;hould be fairly and quietly clos'd,
all Di&s;putes calmly ended, and all Mouths
friendly &s;topp'd.</P>
<P>IT is an uncomfortable Thing to be pur|&s;ued
from the Shop to the Retreat, where|ever
it is, or may be, with the Glamours
of oppre&s;&s;ed Families, the Noi&s;e of the
Poor, or the In&s;ults of the Rich: I am to
&s;uppo&s;e, if a Trade&s;man is leaving off, it
is with the u&s;ual Saying of the rich Men
that withdraw from the World, <HI>That he
may enjoy him&s;elf; that he may live in
Quiet and Peace at the latter End of
his Days, without Noi&s;e, and without
Hurry.</HI> And how can that be done, when
the remaining Di&s;putes of twenty Years
&s;tanding continue un&s;ettled, and all the lit|tle
Brangles of forty Years Trade hang upon
and haunt him to the la&s;t?</P>
<P>IF he would die in Peace, he mu&s;t live
in Peace, make Peace with every Body be|fore
he dies: The Trade&s;man leaving his
Shop, is like another Man's leaving the
World; he &s;hould re&s;olve to die in Charity
with all Men: It is a trading Death; he
dies out of Trade as much as another dies
out of the World; he &s;hould therefore en|deavour
to go off in a Calm.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="230">
BUT a little farther, to explain my&s;elf: I do
not mean by this that he &s;hould clo&s;e all Ac|counts
only, and pay every Man his Due and
ju&s;t Demands; for that he mu&s;t do, or el&s;e
they will &s;ay he <HI>goes off,</HI> not <HI>goes out of
Trade;</HI> that he is broke, not that he leaves
off; that he is a rich Bankrupt, and a thou|&s;and
other namele&s;s Things, which no Man
would care to have &s;aid of him.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man is not properly &s;aid to
have quite left off, or be out of Bu&s;ine&s;s,
ju&s;t by his &s;hutting up his Shop, or put|ting
another into it; unle&s;s he has evened
all Differences, and adju&s;ted all his Di&s;putes
with the World: 'Tis not enough that he
has paid all his Debts, (as he calls it,) if
there are open Accounts and Demands, ei|ther
upon him, or by him upon others; the
Man is &s;till involved, and, which is wor&s;e,
embroil'd with the World: Tho&s;e tan|gled
Skeins are as apt to rai&s;e Slurs, and
bring Scandal upon him at parting, as any
Thing whatever; and the avoiding the&s;e
Things as much as may be, is at lea&s;t a Part
of what I call going quietly out of Trade,
and parting friendly with the World.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY I lay the Stre&s;s of this upon
&s;uch Ca&s;es, and &s;uch Di&s;putes, wherein he
is Plaintiff, not Defendant; where perhaps
he is injurious, or at lea&s;t is &s;aid to be &s;o,
and rigid in his Demands; taking the utmo&s;t
Advantages in Accounts, upon the Defi|ciency
<PB N="215" REF="231">
of a Debtor's Books; for all Trade&s;|men
are not Accomptants; all are not equal|ly
careful; here Parcels of Goods may be
deliver'd to him, and yet the Per&s;ons not
able to make due Proof; there Receipts for
Money may be mi&s;laid, or not be carefully
pre&s;erved, or perhaps Money has been paid,
and the Receipt omitted, and the rich Trade&s;|man,
at fini&s;hing his Accounts, refu&s;es to
allow them, though perhaps he knows it
ju&s;t, taking Advantage of the other's Neg|ligence:
In all the&s;e Ca&s;es, the Trade&s;man
brings an ill Character upon him&s;elf; and
this he &s;hould indu&s;triou&s;ly avoid: He ought
to acknowledge Goods that he knows he has
had deliver'd, Money that he knows he has
received; and not putting the poor Trade&s;|man
upon the Proof of Things, when he
knows he has &s;ome Advantage of his Neg|ligence:
He ought not to take Mi&s;take for
a Balance, and make a poor Trade&s;man
Debtor to his Ignorance; &s;uch an Act of
open Hone&s;ty, acknowledging Money paid,
though without a Receipt, and Goods deli|ver'd,
though without an Evidence, will
do him more Honour in Trade, be&s;ides the
Ju&s;tice of it, than ever Money, twice de|manded,
will do him good.</P>
<P>ALSO by leaving off quietly, and going out
of Trade in a Calm, I mean, that he &s;hould
do generous and kind Things by the World at
parting; not exacting the utmo&s;t Penny with
<PB N="216" REF="232">
Severity, where it cannot be had without
Di&s;tre&s;s; not doing hard Things by any
Man, which at another Time he would not
do upon the Score of farther Trade; and
tear Mankind to Pieces, becau&s;e, or with
this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>What do I value di&s;ob|liging
him, I &s;hall trade no more with him,
I &s;hall get no more by him, and therefore
I will have my Money.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TRADESMEN often, nay, generally for|bear
a Cu&s;tomer, though he be far in Debt,</HI>
Becau&s;e, <HI>&s;ays the Creditor,</HI> he is a good
Cu&s;tomer, though a little long-winded, and
I deal con&s;iderably with him, and am every
Day getting Money by him; and if I am
hard upon him, I &s;hall di&s;oblige him, and
lo&s; my Cu&s;tomer; <HI>and &s;o he lets him owe
a con&s;iderable Sum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when he leaves off, then the Scene
changes: I have done Trade; I expect to
get no more by him; I have nothing to do
but to get in my Debts; what care I for
his Good-will or his Ill-will; I mu&s;t have
my Money, and will have it: And &s;o he
falls upon the poorer Trade&s;man with Vio|lence
and Cruelty; and the Man, not able
to pay him all at once, is undone, and
breaks.</P>
<P>BY this Method the rich Trade&s;man may
indeed hurry in tho&s;e of his Debts that are
current, and where the Debtors are able;
and though it is with Difficulty to many,
<PB N="217" REF="233">
yet they that are any way in Condition to pay,
will do it; but two Things will certainly
follow: Fir&s;t, Tho&s;e that pay him in that
Manner, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e that do it
with Difficulty, will reproach him with In|civility
and Ingratitude, after long, fair,
and friendly U&s;age, and after having gain'd
many Thou&s;ands or Hundreds of Pounds
by them.</P>
<P>AND tho&s;e who cannot bear the Hurry,
though with Patience and ea&s;y good U&s;age
they might have paid all, yet are overthrown,
and fall under the Violence, &s;ink, and are
undone; and &s;o the eager, mercile&s;s, but
avaricious Creditor, lo&s;es the Debt he might
have &s;av'd, and gains the Scandal of a cruel
Creditor into the Bargain.</P>
<P>THIS Way of leaving off Trade is like
one of the Pagan Emperors, that when he
went out of the World, would have had all
the be&s;t Men of his Court, and &s;ome that
had &s;erv'd him mo&s;t faithfully, and the be&s;t
and wealthie&s;t of the Nobility, put to
Death, that the World might mourn for
his Death in the Per&s;ons of their Friends,
who had not died, if the Emperor had liv'd.</P>
<P>THUS the rich Trade&s;man, acting with
Violence and Cruelty, leaves off with the
Ill-ill; and ill Word of every Body; car|rying
off the Spoils of the Trade, as well
as off the poor oppre&s;&s;ed Trade&s;man; and
will he call this leaving off, and Retiring?
<PB N="218" REF="234">
he &s;hould rather call it running away from
the ju&s;t Clamours of the Poor, and remo|ving
him&s;elf only out of the Hearing of it;
like a Man that &s;ets his own Hou&s;e on Fire
to burn his Neighbour's, but takes care to
get out of the Way, that he may not be
burnt him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS nothing is of more Value to a Trade&s;|man,
while in Bu&s;ine&s;s, than his Credit,
&s;o nothing can be of more Value to him
at his going out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, than his Re|putation:
To trade fairly, and leave off
hand&s;omely, fini&s;hes a Trade&s;man's Scene of
Life, and fini&s;hes it the mo&s;t to his Advan|tage,
and in the be&s;t Manner he can de&s;ire;
he goes off with Applau&s;e; he can ask his
Friends, as <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> did, at his Death,
if he had acted his Part well; and can &s;ay
to them with <HI>Augu&s;tus, Plaudite,</HI> and go
off &s;miling.</P>
<P>FOR any Trade&s;man to &s;ay he does not
value the Tongues of Men, or care what
the World &s;ays of him, is to talk like a De|&s;perado,
not like a wi&s;e Man; for tho' (while
acting ju&s;tly and prudently) it is a Part of Wi&s;|dom,
and of a true Greatne&s;s of Mind not
to value what the World &s;ays &s;landerou&s;ly
and unju&s;tly of us; yet it is always the Stu|dy
of good and wi&s;e Men, and is not unwor|thy
that Greatne&s;s of Mind, to act &s;o as
that no Evil can be &s;poken ju&s;tly, and with
Cau&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="235">
EVERY wi&s;e Man &s;tudies to merit the
the Prai&s;e of wi&s;e and good Men, and to
merit it by wi&s;e and good Actions: To be
evil &s;poken of may be the Lot of a good
Man; but to be &s;poken of for Evil, is only
the ju&s;t Due of a Criminal: 'Tis one Thing
to be accu&s;ed, and 'tis another Thing to be
fal&s;ely accu&s;ed; as 'tis one Thing be char|ged
with a Crime, and another Thing to be
guilty; the fir&s;t a wi&s;e Man laughs at, the
la&s;t he trembles at.</P>
<P>BUT not to run this up to a Part too
pungent, and to make it &s;eem piquant and
particular, my Meaning is clear; as Repu|tation
and Credit in Bu&s;ine&s;s is a Trea&s;ure,
and e&s;teemed &s;o by all Trade&s;men, as Dea|lers,
&s;o to go with Reputation out of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
is a Trea&s;ure every Man &s;hould e&s;teem
and covet, as a wi&s;e Man and as a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>NOW no Man has more Advantage in this
Particular than a Trade&s;man, if his Cha|racter
was any thing tolerable before: By
leaving off well, he puts him&s;elf in a Ca|pacity
of forming a compleat Fame, as to
Bu&s;ine&s;s; nay, if he had but an indifferent
good Name before, yet if he goes off clean,
he wipes out all the Blots at once, if they
are not too indelible, and have not, like a
Tincture in Grain, &s;tain'd too deep to be
di&s;charg'd.</P>
<P>BY going out of Trade clean, I mean
clo&s;ing the trading Scene without the Cla|mour
<PB N="220" REF="236">
of the Poor; without Quarrels from
the Rich; without the Charge of fraudulent
Accounts, cavilling and litigious Wran|glings
upon Trifles, denied or revoked A|greements,
Bargains relinqui&s;h'd and di&s;|owned,
only becau&s;e di&s;advantageous; with|out
&s;uffering Suits for ju&s;t Debts, and op|pre&s;&s;ing
poor Men, even in rea&s;onable De|mands;
and many other Ca&s;es, which &s;erve
only to &s;ully the Character of a Trade&s;|man
at his going off.</P>
<P>THE Trade&s;man and the World, like a
Ma&s;ter and an old Servant, &s;hould part lo|vingly,
without Re&s;lections and Ill|ill;
and
this cannot be done without taking care
to leave no old Scores between them un|balanced.
To go out of Trade with the
Clamours of Mankind, loaded with Re|proach,
and follow'd with Imprecations,
and a general Cen&s;ure on their ordinary
Actions, as well as extraordinary; what is
this but declaring War with the World, and
biding human Nature Defiance.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man that has been in good Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a large Acquain|tance;
his Employment requires it; at his
laying down, he drops his general Know|ledge
of the World, his common and ordi|nary
Society, and re&s;erves only a particular
cho&s;en few, who he &s;ets by to call Friends;
forms an Intere&s;t of Intimacy and Friend|&s;hip
<PB N="221" REF="237">
with them, and pre&s;erves it after the
re&s;t are all dropp'd and forgotten.</P>
<P>BUT he does not commence a Breach with
all the re&s;t; neither does the &s;ingling out
a few particular Friends for his Confidence
and Company, intimate, that he &s;hould di&s;|oblige
any Body; no Man then can be af|fronted
that he is not made a Friend, becau&s;e
he was a Cu&s;tomer, or claim that he &s;hould
be a particular Friend afterward, becau&s;e he
was a general Acquaintance before.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is not the Ca&s;e; but my
Meaning is, that the Trade&s;man &s;hould not,
as the Month of <HI>March</HI> is &s;aid to do &s;ome|times,
invert the Cour&s;e of Things, and
coming in like a Lamb, go out like a Lion:
Trade is indeed a Scene of Hurry &s;ome|times,
and the more Bu&s;ine&s;s the more Noi&s;e;
but the Man is not bound to live in a Hurry,
and die in a Storm: In a word, every
wealthy Trade&s;man, who is a Man of
Sen&s;e, will &s;trive, at his laying down his
Bu&s;ine&s;s, to do it with the Smiles of his
Friends, and the good Word of his Ene|mies;
with the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Poor, and
the Favour of the Rich.</P>
<P>THE End of this Di&s;cour&s;e is chiefly di|rected
to this Part; namely, That a Trade&s;|man
&s;hould not, for a few &s;mall petty Debts,
ruffle his poorer Debtors, and commence
Suits at Law with his Cu&s;tomers, upon this
old Foot, this ill-natured Conclu&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="238">
That I have got all I can by them, and I will
lo&s;e nothing back again, if I can help it;
and as for their good Will, what is it to me?
I &s;hall have no more to do with them, I
have no more Dealings with them; what do
I value their good or their ill Will?</P>
<P>ON the contrary, with what Advantage
does an hone&s;t Trade&s;man leave the World,
when he &s;hews him&s;elf ea&s;y with his Deb|tors,
giving Time to &s;ome, and even quit|ting
others, where Pity calls for it? As a
good Chri&s;tian dies in Charity with all the
World, &s;o he goes off the Stage of Trade
with a general Kindne&s;s in his Brea&s;t to all
Mankind; he gives every one good U&s;age,
and receives the like; the Poor pray for him,
the Rich are fond of him, and all Men
&s;peak well of him.</P>
<P>THIS is the Exit of a Compleat Trade&s;|man:
Hitherto I have been directing him
in his Way, I am now directing how to make
up his Bottom. There is as much need of
Council in a Trade&s;man's End, as there was
in his Beginning, only perhaps the la&s;t is
the more difficult; as 'tis always more diffi|cult
to end wi&s;ely, than to begin wi&s;ely.</P>
<P>AS I know not whether of the two is the
mo&s;t difficult in the Cour&s;e of a Chri&s;tian's
Life, to <HI>live well,</HI> or to <HI>die well;</HI> and 'tis
certain, that one depends very much upon
the other: So it is the &s;ame in Trade&s;men;
if a Man has been a fair Trader all his Life,
<PB N="223" REF="239">
if he has acted ju&s;tly and honourably in the
World, if he has been a generous open heart|ed
Neighbour, a fair Dealer, quiet in his Di&s;|po&s;ition,
a Man of a wi&s;e prudent Manage|ment,
he finds it as ea&s;y to pre&s;erve the good
Will of Mankind at la&s;t, as he did to gain
it at fir&s;t; but if he has been a &s;harping, cun|ning,
over-reaching
Dealer; if he has been
a cruel Biter and Devourer of the Poor that
laboured under him, obliging them to make
Brick without Straw, &s;hortening their Wa|ges,
but exacting, or rather increa&s;ing
their Work; making them fir&s;t beg for Work,
and then beg for their Pay; taking Advan|rages
of the Poverty of the Seller, to buy
under the true Worth of the Goods; and, in
a Word, oppre&s;&s;ing, not the Trade&s;man on|ly,
but the Trade it&s;elf; he meets with the
the Reward of it at la&s;t, and goes out of
Trade with as ill a Name as he lived in it;
he entails even upon his Memory, as a
Trade&s;man, the Cur&s;es of the Poor, the Re|proaches
of the Rich, the ill Word of eve|ry
Body, and has the good Word of no
Body.</P>
<P>THERE'S no Popery in Trade: Works of
Supererogation may be allowed here; and tho'
a Trade&s;man's Soul &s;hall not be &s;av'd by his
own Merit, any more than that of another
Fellow-chri&s;tian,
yet his Reputation may;
indeed, it &s;hall or can be pre&s;erv'd by no other
Means: As he behaves, &s;o he &s;hall be e&s;|teem'd.
<PB N="224" REF="240">
It is true, the World may &s;ome|times
run again&s;t a Man's Character, in a
&s;trong Current of general Di&s;like, without
a due Cau&s;e, and common Fame does not al|ways
do a Man Ju&s;tice: But this is very rare,
and happens rather in other Things than in
Trade, as in publick Affairs, in Politicks, in
Religion and Opinion; and it is particular
to &s;uch Ca&s;es, becau&s;e tho&s;e Things general|ly
run by Parties and Factions, by Schi&s;ms
and Divi&s;ions in Principles, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT in Trade it is very &s;eldom thus; the
World is generally more ju&s;t in this Part
of Life, than in any other Ca&s;es: If a
Trade&s;man is ju&s;t and fair in his Dealings,
if he is compa&s;&s;ionate and kind to the Poor;
if he performs his Agreements punctually,
and pays his poor Workmen chearfully and
generou&s;ly; he carries the Fame of it after
him, and goes off, I mean at his laying
down Trade, with the good Will and the
good Word of all the World. Nay, which
is &s;omething unu&s;ual in mo&s;t other Ca&s;es in
the World, they are as extravagant in their
Applau&s;e, as they are on the other Side
of their Clamour, and will &s;et him as high
above his Merit, as they will run another
down below it.</P>
<P>AS then this is the Way of the World,
and that People do and will act thus by one
another in all &s;uch Ca&s;es, 'tis in the Trade&s;|man's
View, and con&s;equently in his Choice,
<PB N="225" REF="241">
upon what Terms to &s;tand with Mankind at
parting; and tho' 'tis true, a wi&s;e Man will
not overrate
the Popular Opinion, whether
for him or again&s;t him, yet I cannot but
think, every Man would rather go off the
Stage with the good Will of his Neigh|bours,
than with a general Odium.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but recommend it to every
Trade&s;man to do &s;o for this Rea&s;on, becau&s;e
the Merit of <HI>the fir&s;t</HI> is ordinarily founded
upon a ju&s;t and human Cour&s;e of Life, do|ing
Things commendable and Prai&s;we|orthy
in
them&s;elves, and which a wi&s;e Man ought
to practi&s;e, whether they were rewarded with
due Acknowledgments from the World, or no.
On the other hand, the Merit of the &s;econd
is generally founded upon Ju&s;tice too, that
is to &s;ay, the Man by a long Series of un|fair
Dealing, or of unkind and cruel U&s;age,
and other, the ordinary Vices of a griping
over-reaching
Trade&s;man, ju&s;tly brings tho&s;e
Things upon him&s;elf; and he may &s;o far be
properly &s;aid to &s;uffer as an Evil-doer,
that
is to &s;ay, to &s;uffer ju&s;tly, which no wi&s;e
Man can de&s;ire to do.</P>
<P>THIS is the Rea&s;on why I lay &s;o much
Weight upon that Point, and argue &s;o much
for the Trade&s;man's laying down his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
upon good Terms with the World. I
am as much for de&s;pi&s;ing Slander and Re|proach
as any Man, and as any Man ought
to be. I think it a <HI>Brutum fulmen</HI> in its
<PB N="226" REF="242">
own Nature; 'tis a Thunder without a Bolt,
a Cannon fir'd without a Ball, Rage with|out
a Weapon, a Snake without a Sting;
there's no true Satyr in it, and a good Man
has nothing to fear from it.</P>
<P>BUT then we mu&s;t add this, that we
&s;hould be &s;ure that it is really Slander, not
Scandal: Scandal is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the La&s;h
of a real Fact; Slander is the Scourge of
Fal&s;hood, and the Effect of Malice. He
that can de&s;pi&s;e the ill Tongues of Men, is
a Philo&s;opher and a good Chri&s;tian; but it
mu&s;t be upon a Suppo&s;ition, that he is inno|cent
too, or el&s;e he acts neither Philo&s;opher
or Chri&s;tian, but goes upon a meer Stock of
<HI>Face,</HI> a kind of Hardne&s;s that I can hardly
give a Name to.</P>
<P>HE that can hold up his Face to the World,
in the Teeth of a general Clamour, and yet
be at the &s;ame Time guilty, and know in his
Con&s;cience that he merits their Reproach,
and that they have Rea&s;on for what they
&s;ay, is arriv'd to a Degree &s;omething be|yond
the Power of human Nature, even in
its utmo&s;t Degeneracy; and mu&s;t have &s;ome
A&s;&s;i&s;tance from one who&s;e Name I need
not mention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man's being Pur&s;e-proud; the
Folly and the Scandal of it; and how ju&s;t|ly
ridiculous it renders him in the World.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I have cautioned the Trade&s;man
again&s;t being &s;ecure in his Pro&s;peri|ty,
&s;o I cannot quit him, without
&s;aying a Word to him about his particular
per&s;onal Conduct in his Pro&s;perity; and that
is a noi&s;y, furfeiting, trouble&s;ome Blu&s;ter of
his Wealth, and of his great Wi&s;dom and
good Judgment in gaining it; this we call,
and ju&s;tly too, being <HI>Pur&s;e-proud;</HI>
and 'tis
the mo&s;t hateful un&s;ociable Thing belonging
to a Trade&s;man; and yet 'tis what is very
difficult for him to avoid.</P>
<P>If the Trade&s;man is ri&s;en from nothing to
be an Alderman, to be a Man in Wealth and
Figure, it might &s;uffice him, that the verySta|tion
of Life he fills up in the Place where he
lives, declares it: His Fur-gown
and Gold
Chain, the antient Geugaws of Corporation
Pageantry, and the grave magi&s;teral Suppor|ters
of a Trade&s;man's Pride, might be &s;ufficient
to tell the World he is rich, without his
never-wea&s;ing
Tongue being always trum|peting
out his own Prai&s;es, and his own
Wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="244">
OR, if I was to talk &s;eriou&s;ly to him, tho'
that's out of Fa&s;hion too in the City, as
well as at Court, I would &s;ay, he &s;hould
&s;atisfy him&s;elf with being &s;ecretly thankful
to Heaven, for ble&s;&s;ing his Diligence, and
not be always boa&s;ting to Men, as if his Di|ligence
was the Merit, and that Heaven was
only ju&s;t to him, in giving him the due Re|ward
of it.</P>
<P>BUT a Word about that Part is enough, <HI>as
Times</HI> go; I am now to &s;peak to the &s;ociable
Part of it: How odd does it found in his
Mouth, to have his whole Time, (on all Oc|ca&s;ions,
in all Societies, and interrupting all
Conver&s;ation,) be taken up with it, all Di&s;|cour&s;e
&s;umm'd up in it, all good Company
entertain'd with it, I might have &s;aid di&s;|turb'd
with it?</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, I think a Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;man
one of the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and
intollerable of all God's two legg'd Crea|tures;
and this as well before he has left off
Trade, as afterwards.</P>
<P>BEFORE he has left off, he is &s;o to his
Neighbours and <HI>Fellow|rade&s;men;</HI>
after he
has left off he is the like <HI>among Gentlemen:</HI>
As to the Trade&s;man, he in&s;ults every one
of them in their Turn, Poor as well as Rich:
He le&s;&s;ens the latter, and perfectly tramples
upon the former: He attacks the rich Trade&s;|man
with all po&s;&s;ible Railery, tells you he
has thriven a little by Accident or Nece&s;&s;ity;
<PB N="229" REF="245">
that he may perhaps have gotten a little
Money, but nothing like what the World
talks of: That had he been left in &s;uch a Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
he would have made twenty Times as
much of it by that Time: The other, &s;ays he,
was left with a good Stock, and a good Trade,
but has been &s;o far from bettering it in his
Hands, that he has not half the Trade his indu&s;|trious
Father had: Whereas I, <HI>&s;ays the Rho|domontading
bloated Creature,</HI> began without
any of tho&s;e Advantages; I hammer'd out
a Trade by my own Indu&s;try, by the Force
of an invincible Application, and by my
Judgment in Bu&s;ine&s;s: If he had begun
without &s;uch Helps as he had to introduce
him, he would have been a Beggar and a
Bankrupt long ago; and then he adds, grin|ning,
who knows what may happen yet?
whereas I hewed my Way through Rocks
and Mountains.</P>
<P>THEN he goes on upon another Point:
He has fool'd away good Part of what he
got, &s;ays the blu&s;tring Creature, by tru&s;ting
out his Stock hand-over-head, to he knew
not who; taking no Care to be well inform'd
of the Characters of Men, and whether they
were fit to be tru&s;ted, or no; and there, adds
he, with a Snear, he fool'd away 500 <HI>l.</HI> by
tru&s;ting <HI>G</HI>&mdash;<HI>S</HI>&mdash;, a Fellow I would not
have tru&s;ted with 500 <HI>s.</HI> Alas! I &s;aw by the
Way of his trading, and the Manner of his
going on, that he would not hold it; I knew
<PB N="230" REF="246">
he would break at la&s;t; I always believed
&s;o, and always &s;aid &s;o.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> That might be true, indeed, be|cau&s;e
he generally &s;aid &s;o of every Bo|dy,
as is cu&s;tomary; for when any Man
fails in Trade, 'tis u&s;ual for &s;uch Peo|ple
to pretend, they knew and expect|ed
it long before, tho' perhaps all the
re&s;t of the Town was &s;urpriz'd at it,
and thought the Per&s;on a rich and &s;afe
Man to deal with.</Q>
<P>THEN he runs on again upon the Folly
and Madne&s;s of the rich Trade&s;man's tru&s;t|ing
out his Effects, and hazarding his E&s;tate,
by unwarily giving great Credit to &s;uch and
&s;uch People, by which he has had great Lo&s;|&s;es,
&s;uch as, for ought he knows, may be fatal
to him at la&s;t. But I, <HI>continues he,</HI> (with a
Gravity &s;uitable to his Pride,) have always
acted by other Rules, I have taken other
Mea&s;ures; if I had not I had not been where
I am; I had been &s;till labouring in the Fire,
and working to get Money hone&s;tly, for
Fools to run away with knavi&s;hly.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> This Di&s;cour&s;e is upon a Sup|po&s;ition,
that a Man may always judge
of the Bottom and Sub&s;tance of every
Trade&s;man that he deals with, than
which nothing is more untrue; and that
<PB N="231" REF="247">
we &s;ee the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Trade&s;men,
tho&s;e who we thought to be like Pil|lars
of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> &s;ink and fall in|to
Misfortune and Mi&s;ery, as I have &s;aid
but ju&s;t before; and nothing is more a&s;|&s;uming,
than for a Man to &s;ay, he can
always judge of the Sub&s;tance of a
Trade&s;man by his Out&s;ide, and, in &s;hort,
may know who is fit to be tru&s;ted, and
who not.</Q>
<P>THUS far we take the Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;|man's
Blu&s;tering among his Fellow Trade&s;|men,
and vaunting of his own Prudence
and Condition; his Wi&s;dom in judging who
to deal with, and who not; who were fit to
be tru&s;ted, and who not; and what Trade&s;|men
were likely to &s;tand, and what to fall;
when at the &s;ame Time the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t
wary Men in Trade in the World are often
deceiv'd in that very one Point, which I take
to be one of the mo&s;t important Difficulties
of Trade.</P>
<P>BY this Prudence it is he boa&s;ts, that he
has always avoided Lo&s;&s;es, has forborn to
tru&s;t tho&s;e Men, who have afterwards fail'd;
that by this he has pre&s;erved him&s;elf and his
Fortune, when others have &s;unk by their Un|warine&s;s,
and been undone, whereas the
Truth of the Story has been, that he has not
had Stock &s;ufficient to tru&s;t them, and &s;o has
<PB N="232" REF="248">
not been in a Condition in Trade to lo&s;e any
Thing by their Misfortune.</P>
<P>THUS I have known &s;everal of tho&s;e
Pur&s;e-proud
Creatures fit peddling in a Shop
twenty to thirty, nay, to forty Years, and not
being able to give Credit, tho' to the be&s;t of
Dealers, (for almo&s;t all Trade&s;men take as
well as give Credit in their Bu&s;ine&s;s,) ri&s;e
perhaps to be worth a thou&s;and Pound, or
perhaps two, and then boa&s;t of their Policy
and Prudence in Trade, their Warine&s;s and
Caution in giving Credit, <HI>and the like;</HI> where|as
the generous open-hearted
Trade&s;man,
who they reproach with his Want of Cau|tion,
tho' he has lo&s;t more than the other
ever got, goes on with Courage, and, it may
be, leaves off at la&s;t with ten to fifteen to
twenty thou&s;and Pound in his Pocket; having
carried on a va&s;t Trade, given great Credit,
&s;erv'd his Neighbours, been a publick Be|nefit
to Trade in general, and to all the
People he has dealt with in particular;
which the Pur&s;e-proud
Creature, I &s;peak
of, could not pretend to, nor had Room to
expect; and yet he bla&s;ts this Conduct with
his vain conceited Tongue, and &s;ugge&s;ts, that
the more frank and generous Trade&s;man mu&s;t
die a Beggar.</P>
<P>THIS in&s;upportable Wretch has always
another Thing attending his ill Tongue,
and that is Envy: As he &s;peaks well of no
Body, &s;o he mu&s;t envy every Body, e&s;pe|cially
<PB N="233" REF="249">
every Body that out|ives
his Re|proach;
it cannot be otherwi&s;e: He that
thus &s;peaks &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly of his thriving
Neighbours, &s;peaks as he wi&s;hes it to
be; he has an Exception to every Man's
Fame and Character, be it ever &s;o good;
and the better it is, the more he is piqu'd
at it: This is the natural Product of an en|vious
Spirit; he in&s;inuates, that they will
mi&s;carry, becau&s;e he &s;ecretly de&s;ires they
&s;hould do &s;o. Again, Envy is of a Na|ture
&s;o agreeing with that of the dreadful
Pit from whence it came, and &s;o tinctur'd
from <HI>Satan,</HI> in whom, <HI>if we may believe
the Learned,</HI> it was the original Crime, and
laid the Foundation of his fir&s;t Rebellion,
that, like him, it falls always upon the be&s;t
Objects: The brighte&s;t Character is the
Mark at which Envy is certain to &s;hoot all
its poi&s;on'd Darts; and as it is &s;o in Ca&s;es
of a higher Nature, 'tis &s;o in its Degree in
this.</P>
<P>THE Man I am &s;peaking of is fir&s;t a
poor, empty, bloated-up
Animal, who ri|&s;ing
from nothing, or &s;omething very mean,
and having been lifted up beyond what he
was, continues always lifted beyond what
he is: He is &s;o, and will be &s;o, becau&s;e,
though his Stock of Money may encrea&s;e,
yet his Stock of Pride encrea&s;es &s;till fa&s;ter
than his Wealth; and as he knows that
tho' he is tolerably well, yet he is not all
<PB N="234" REF="250">
he pretends to be; &s;o he cannot patiently
bear that others &s;hould ri&s;e beyond what he
knows him&s;elf to be.</P>
<P>THIS &s;wells his Envy; for as Pride is the
fir&s;t Vice in the Soul, &s;o Envy is the fir&s;t|born
Product of Pride, and 'tis a true natu|ral
Child, the Image of its Parent: In a
word, to drive at Things above our&s;elves
is Pride; to hate all that out-go
us, and
ri&s;e too fa&s;t for us, is Envy; and to &s;lan|der
all we hate, is the Product of both;
'tis the Fruit by which the Tree is known.</P>
<P>WHY is the Man's Mouth always full of
Evil, but becau&s;e his Heart is always full of
Envy? And whence comes his Envy, but from
his Pride? Becau&s;e the Man exceeds him or
excels him, the fir&s;t in Wealth, the la&s;t in
Merit, either of them whets his Anger,
and he runs on railing; for 'tis &s;aid ju&s;tly
of Envy, it goes always with its Mouth
open.</P>
<P>BUT to leave the Cau&s;es, and go on with
the Facts; for 'tis this gives the Offence,
and makes the Man &s;o trouble&s;ome to all
about him: Could his Picture be drawn,
you would &s;ee him like a Ballad-singer,
always
with a Crowd about him; but they
are of &s;uch a kind, as no Man need be vain
of, and none but &s;uch a Man could; for
wi&s;e Men &s;hun him as they would an In|fection;
he per&s;ecutes them, indeed, with
his Noi&s;e; but any By-stander
might &s;ee,
<PB N="235" REF="251">
though him&s;elf cannot, that they are &s;ick
of him; that his Noi&s;e &s;urfeits them; that
his Song, being always to one Tune, has no
Mu&s;ick in it; and that they avoid him as
much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>INDEED, my Bu&s;ine&s;s is not to write Cha|racters
here, but to warn the Compleat
Trade&s;man, to whom I all along direct my
Di&s;cour&s;e, to avoid the hateful Character;
and as I would have him act in another
Manner, &s;o I would have him act from other
Principles: The Truth is, to infu&s;e Princi|ples
of Mode&s;ty, Prudence, Diligence, and
Virtue, into a young Trade&s;man, is to &s;e|cure
him from acting in &s;uch a Manner as
this: He that ri&s;es by Steps of Wi&s;dom and
Prudence, will &s;tand upon the &s;ame Bottom,
will go on to act by the &s;ame Rules, and
not run into the Vices of Trade, when he
has thriven by the Virtue of it.</P>
<P>HE that gets an E&s;tate by Hone&s;ty, will
enjoy it with Mode&s;ty: To boa&s;t of his
own Wi&s;dom in the ama&s;ing his Money,
and in&s;ult the Sen&s;es and Under&s;tanding of
every Man that has mi&s;carried, is not only
a Token of Immode&s;ty, but, if that were
of any Force with this Age, I &s;hould &s;ay,
'tis the infallible Mark of Irreligion; 'tis
&s;acrificing to his own Net, and to his own
Drag, to his own Head, and to his own
Hands: 'Tis not a Phari&s;ee, indeed; for he
went up to the Temple with, <HI>God, I thank
<PB N="236" REF="252">
thee,</HI> in his Mouth; he boa&s;ted, indeed, of
more Holine&s;s than he had, as this Man
often does of more Money than he has:
But the Phari&s;ee out-did
him there, that he
acknowledg'd it to his Maker, that he was
&s;o good and &s;o righteous, and not like the
Publican: But this Man forgetting to look
up, or to look in, as he might do, looks
only upon the Out&s;ide of his Affairs, as
<HI>Nebuchaduezzar</HI> did upon the City of <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI>
Dan. iv. 30. <HI>Is not this great</HI> BABEL,
<HI>that I have built for the Hou&s;e of my
King, done by the Might of</HI> my Power, <HI>and
for the Honour of</HI> my Maje&s;ty; and what
follows in the very next Line, a Voice came
from Heaven, thus: <HI>O</HI> KING, <HI>to thee is it
&s;poken, they &s;hall drive thee</HI> from Men,
<HI>and thy Dwelling &s;hall be</HI> with the Bea&s;ts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I confe&s;s the <HI>Simile</HI> is too high for the
Bea&s;t I am &s;peaking of, infinitely too high;
but it is &s;o &s;uitable to him in all the Parts,
as well as in the End, that nothing can more
ju&s;tly, or more aptly match with him; he
is really fit to be driven <HI>from among Men,</HI>
and to dwell with the Bea&s;ts of the Field;
for he is too tire&s;ome to live among his
Neighbours.</P>
<P>I would calmly caution my young Trade&s;|man,
who aims at the Title I am prepa|ring
him for, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Compleat, to &s;hun
every Thing that has the lea&s;t Tendency
<PB N="237" REF="253">
to this Evil, this trading Vice, as a Thing
that will at la&s;t rob him of all the true
Enjoyment of his Pro&s;perity when it comes.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man has Hazards enough of
thriving at all, and Fears and Anxieties
enough all the Way he goes; and 'tis great
Pity, that when he has thriven he &s;hould
not enjoy it with Satisfaction to him&s;elf,
and with the Kindne&s;s, E&s;teem, and Affec|tion
of his Neighbours: A wi&s;e, &s;ober,
mode&s;t Trade&s;man, when he is thriven, and
grown rich, is really a valuable Man, and
he is valued on all Occa&s;ions: As he went
on with every Body's good Wi&s;hes when
he was getting it, &s;o he has every Body's
Ble&s;&s;ing and good Word when he has
got it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if he retains the Character when
he is out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, which he de&s;erved
and gain'd when he was in Bu&s;ine&s;s, he is a
publick Good in the Place where he lives; as
he was u&s;eful to him&s;elf before, he is u&s;eful
to every Body el&s;e after: Such a Man has
more Opportunity of doing good than al|mo&s;t
any other Per&s;on I can name: He is
u&s;eful a thou&s;and Ways, and many of them,
&s;uch as Men of ten Times his Learning
and Education and Capacities in other
Things are able to be.</P>
<P>HE is in the fir&s;t Place a kind of a natu|ral
Magi&s;trate in the Town where he lives;
and all the little Cau&s;es, which in Matters
<PB N="238" REF="254">
of Trade are innumerable, and which often,
for want of &s;uch a Judge, go on to Suits
at Law, and &s;o ruin the People concern'd
in them by the Expence, the Delay, the
Wounds in Sub&s;tance, and the Wounds in
Reputation, which they often bring with
them: I &s;ay, all the&s;e Cau&s;es are brought
before him; and he not only hears and de|termines
them, but in many of them his
Determination &s;hall be as effectual among
the contending Trade&s;men, and his Vote as
deci&s;ive, as any Lord Chancellor in the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he is the general Peace|Maker
of the Country, the common Arbi|trator
of all trading Differences, Family
Breaches, private Injuries; and in general,
he is the Dome&s;tick Judge, in Trade e&s;pe|cially;
and by this he gains a general Re|&s;pect,
an univer&s;al Kind of Reverence in
all the Families about him, nay, he has the
Ble&s;&s;ings and Prayers of Poor and Rich.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he is the Trade-coun&s;ellor
of
the Country where he lives: It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;s'd,
in Matters of Commerce, Lawyers
make but very poor Work, when they come
to be con&s;ulted about the little Di&s;putes
which continually happen among Trade&s;|men,
and are &s;o far from &s;etting Things to
Rights, that they generally, by their Igno|rance
in the U&s;age and Cu&s;toms of Trade,
make Breaches wider, rather than clo&s;ing
<PB N="239" REF="255">
them, and leave Things wor&s;e than they
find them.</P>
<P>NOT that I have any Regard in this Part
to the general Scandal which lies upon the
Country Lawyers, (ay, and Town Lawyers
too,) <HI>viz.</HI> of &s;etting People together by
the Ears, in order to reconcile them; that
is to &s;ay, to widen Breaches, in order to
heal them their own Way; but it too often
happens &s;o, whether they intend it &s;o, or no;
and I cannot &s;ay they have the Reproach
of it without Cau&s;e; whether it happens
through Ignorance or De&s;ign, is not to my
pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; nor am I to make this
Work go out of its Way, to write Satyr
upon Profe&s;&s;ions of any kind.</P>
<P>BUT let the Lawyers act how they will,
and go to&mdash;their own Way in general:
The Ca&s;e here is Fact, in the Particular,
that as among Coun&s;ellors one is a good
Chancery Man, another a good City Coun|&s;el,
another is practis'd in one Court, and
at one Bar, another at the other Bar; one
is a Chamber-coun&s;el,
another a Convey|ancer,
another a Pleader; &s;o the old, ap|prov'd,
experienced Trade&s;man, that has
the Reputation of an hone&s;t Man, has left
off Bu&s;ine&s;s, and gone out of Trade with
a good Reputation for Judgment, Integrity,
and Mode&s;ty, he is the Oracle for Trade,
every one goes to him for Advice, refers to
<PB N="240" REF="256">
his Opinion, and con&s;ults with him in diffi|cult
and intricate Ca&s;es.</P>
<P>AND to crown all, he is the Trade|Chan|cellor
of the whole Place: Differences are
adju&s;ted, Enemies reconcil'd, equitable Que|&s;tions
re&s;olv'd by him: He is not the Arbi|ter,
but the Umpire; he is the la&s;t Re&s;ort;
even when Arbitrators cannot make it up,
he is cho&s;en to arbitrate between the Arbi|trators:
As the <HI>Romans</HI> had two Con&s;uls,
which were their Leaders in Time of War,
and their Guides in Time of Peace; Gene|rals
in the Field, and Judges in the Town;
&s;o they had their <HI>Dictator,</HI> who was Su|perior
to the Con&s;uls, who had the ultimate
Authority that the Commonwealth could
give; they were every Thing, and every
where; had the Power of Life and Death
in their ab&s;olute Determination; the Dicta|tor
was Lord Chancellor in the State, and
Generali&s;&s;imo in the Camp.</P>
<P>SO this happy Trade&s;man is the Sum of all
the Application of the other Trade&s;men near
him, or that know him; he not only adju&s;ts
Differences before they come to a Height, and
&s;o prevents the People going to Law, &s;aves
them from the Expence of their Money,
and the wa&s;ting Extravagances of violent,
and perhaps malicious Pro&s;ecutions, but
makes Men Friends, when they are, as it were,
ju&s;t beginning to be Enemies; and before
the Breaches are come to a Head, he &s;tops
<PB N="241" REF="257">
the Erruption; Like the Moderator, he calms
the Pa&s;&s;ions of the Furious, checks the Con|tentious;
and finding out the healing Medium
which &s;atis&s;ies both Sides, brings them to
yield to one another, and &s;o does Ju&s;tice to
both.</P>
<P>THUS he is, in a word, a kind of a common
Peace-maker;
and as we call the elde&s;t Al|derman
the Father of the City, &s;o he is, in a
kind, the Father of the trading World in the
Orb or Circle where he moves in; his Pre|&s;ence
has a kind of a Peace-taking
A&s;pect in
it, and he is as nece&s;&s;ary as a Magi&s;trate, whe|ther
he is in Office, or not, nay, he is a thou|&s;and
Times more u&s;eful than &s;ome good-for-nothing
Mayors and Aldermen, when not
attended with valuable and &s;uitable Qua|lities:
And this brings me back to the poor
empty rattling Pur&s;e-proud
Body I was &s;peak|ing
of before.</P>
<P>LET my young Trade&s;man but fix his
Eye upon &s;uch an one; I doubt he needs not
go far to &s;eek him; there are few Cities, or
Corporations, or Courts of Aldermen, but
have &s;ome Time or other the Misfortune to
be troubled with them: Let him, I &s;ay, mark
the Man, &s;ee how he behaves, hark how
he rings out his own Character, how he
dwells upon his own extraordinary Self on
every Occa&s;ion; and with what a Storm of
Impertinence he breaks out, in the greate&s;t
<PB N="242" REF="258">
and be&s;t Company, and let him ask him&s;elf,
if the Pattern be worth his Imitation?</P>
<P>FROM him let the Ob&s;erver turn to his
wi&s;er Neighbours, and &s;ee how the blu&s;ter|ing
Creature is accepted; how all the Com|pany
are &s;urfeited with him, and &s;ick of
him; how they turn from him when he is
pre&s;ent, and laugh at him when he is ab|&s;ent;
how he is the common Burthen of So|ciety,
and how diligently the be&s;t Men a|void
him.</P>
<P>LET him hear the Opinion of the mo&s;t
Judicious, concerning this Man's Conduct;
his Way in Company, or out of it, in his
Bu&s;ine&s;s, or out of his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and not|with&s;tanding
his having gotten &s;ome Money,
let the Trade&s;man judge from the whole,
whether that Conduct is to be imitated; whe|ther
you would be pleas'd with &s;uch a Cha|racter;
with being &s;o receiv'd among wi&s;e
Men; and with having &s;o vi&s;ibly, &s;o uni|ver&s;ally
the Contempt of all Men ca&s;t upon
you, in Company, or out of Company; and
as you can upon &s;edate Thoughts be plea|&s;ed
with it, or di&s;pleas'd, &s;o make your
own Conduct agree with it or di&s;agree with
it.</P>
<P>I have upon many Occa&s;ions &s;poken in
this Work to the Trade&s;man I am talking
to, of a certain Thing called Reputation:
The Word indeed in Trade has a particular
<PB N="243" REF="259">
Import, and &s;igni&s;ies a Man of Sub&s;tance, a
Man of Credit, fit to be tru&s;ted, or as it is
more ordinarily expre&s;s'd, an able Man: Al&s;o
there is a Thing called Hone&s;ty, which is
under&s;tood too in the general Article of Re|putation:
To &s;ay a Man is a Knave, or to
reflect upon him as not an hone&s;t Man, is
to wound his Reputation; &s;o that Reputa|tion
there, is of a particular Signification:
But there is a Reputation too which relates
to the per&s;onal Conduct and Capacities of a
Man; as &s;uch a Man has the Reputation of
being a Man of Sen&s;e, the Reputation of
a Man of Parts and Under&s;tanding, or the
Reputation of a Man of Virtue and Mode&s;|ty,
and the like. If you reproach a Man
with ill Manners, or ill Morals, (the la&s;t e&s;pe|cially,)
he takes it very ill, and &s;ays you in|jure
his Reputation.</P>
<P>IT is every Way to my Purpo&s;e here;
if my young Trade&s;man is to be &s;uppos'd to
aim at his true Intere&s;t, he will ob&s;erve, that
to be careful of his Reputation in all the&s;e, is
as e&s;&s;ential to him, as that of his Credit in
Payments, and that to be e&s;teemed a Man of
Under&s;tanding, of Sen&s;e, Mode&s;ty, and Vir|tue,
is as well worth his Concern, as 'tis to
be e&s;teem'd a Man of Subftance.</P>
<P>THE laft indeed is u&s;eful in the Begin|ning
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the fir&s;t in his lea|ving
it off; the la&s;t makes him come in with
<PB N="244" REF="260">
Reputation, and the fir&s;t makes him go out
with Reputation; with this Difference too in
the Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Reputation, which
we call Credit, is temporary, 'tis wanting
and needful only for a little while, that is to
&s;ay, &s;o long as he wants to be tru&s;ted, &s;o long
as he is drudging through the World, and
working for an E&s;tate; but when he has
thriven, and got it, that Reputation is u&s;e|le&s;s,
and at an End.</P>
<P>BUT the Reputation of his Capacities,
Sen&s;e, and Under&s;tanding, and e&s;pecially
that which indeed is ordinarily attendant up|on
them, namely, his Virtue and Mode&s;ty;
the&s;e are valuable from his Beginning to his
End, and that not to the End of his Trade only,
but of his Life; not only when he was poor,
but when he is rich, and rather more at la&s;t
than at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>NOR can he ever &s;ay it is of no U&s;e to
him, to be thought a wi&s;e and under&s;tand|ing,
a mode&s;t and good Man; he always
&s;tands in Need of it: This is the Life of
his Character <HI>at la&s;t,</HI> as well as <HI>at fir&s;t:</HI>
This is the good Name, which the wi&s;e Man
&s;ays is <HI>better than Life,</HI> which a good
Man had rather die than part with, and cea|&s;es
to be a good Man when he lo&s;es it, e&s;pe|cially
if he ju&s;tly forfeits it.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man grown rich and above the
World, tells you he wants no Credit, he
<PB N="245" REF="261">
does not value Credit, becau&s;e he asks no
Man to tru&s;t him. But no Trade&s;man, at
lea&s;t no wi&s;e Man, will &s;ay &s;o of his Repu|tation;
for every Man, Trade&s;men or others,
de&s;ires to de&s;erve the Name of an hone&s;t Man,
and of a Man of Sen&s;e and Virtue; and
a Trade&s;man leaving off his Bu&s;ine&s;s ought
to regard it much more, than even the &s;ame
Trade&s;man in the Hurry of his Trade; not
that an hone&s;t Man &s;hould not always pre|&s;erve
his Character as a Man of Hone&s;ty;
but it may be more remarkably nece&s;&s;ary at
one Time than another, at lea&s;t, it is of more
U&s;e at one Time than another. <HI>For Ex|ample;</HI></P>
<P>THE
Character of a Trade&s;man, for a
Man of Sen&s;e and Under&s;tanding, is more
particularly of U&s;e to him, when he comes
to leave off, and &s;ettle among his Neighbours
as a Man of Years, than at any Time be|fore;
and that on many Accounts: Of what
U&s;e is he to the World, or to him&s;elf, if he
is not al&s;o a Man of &s;ome Weight in this
particular Article of his Under&s;tanding?
Of what U&s;e to him&s;elf? of what Value
to tho&s;e about him? Of what Weight is an
OLD FOOL in a Pari&s;h, or in a Town?
What Good does a poor &s;hallow, noi&s;y, Pur&s;e|proud
Trade&s;man do in his Generation, to
him&s;elf, or to any Body el&s;e? A weak-head|ed
empty Trade&s;man out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
<PB N="246" REF="262">
left capable to do nothing, and &s;ay nothing,
what is he? what but a poor unactive
Thing, that ri&s;es in the Morning to go to
Bed at Night? waits a little Time ju&s;t to
drop into the Grave, and be forgotten? No
body wants him while he lives, or mi&s;s him
when he dies: If any Thing of Con&s;e|quence
is felt from him, it is the Ea&s;e that
his Neighbours obtain at their Clubs and So|cieties,
and in their ordinary Conver&s;ation,
by being delivered from his Noi&s;e, and
being no more tired and di&s;ordered by the
di&s;cording un&s;onorous Clamour of his
Tongue, always ringing Changes upon the
hateful Subject of his own Prai&s;es, and his
mighty Wealth, gotten by his exorbitant Di|ligence,
and his inimitable Application.</P>
<P>BUT to have done with him as fa&s;t as we
can, I mu&s;t take a little Notice of him when
he is out of his Element, as well as in it; and
then I &s;hall do, as it ought to be done with
him, turn him out of the Company. I have
mentioned his Behaviour and Reception a|mong
his Fellow-Trade&s;men,
his Brethren
of the <HI>Counter</HI> and the <HI>Compting-Hou&s;e,</HI>
the
Men of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, his Neigh|bours,
and Equals.</P>
<P>IF they are &s;ick of him, if they are gor|ged
with his Rattling and Noi&s;e, how is it
when he comes among Gentlemen? when
&s;allying out from his Sphere, in which Na|ture
<PB N="247" REF="263">
circum&s;crib'd him, and for which alone
he was fitted, (if fit for any Thing,) he comes
out, and calls him&s;elf <HI>a Gentleman?</HI> What
Figure does he make among them? What
Reception do they give him? The late King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. of merry Memory, the be&s;t hu|mour'd
Man (whatever he was for a King)
that ever till then wore the Character of
<HI>Royal,</HI> u&s;ually had that Expre&s;&s;ion, that he
<HI>could make a Knight,</HI> but he <HI>could not make
a</HI> GENTLEMAN; <HI>Ex quo vis Ligno non fit
Mercurio.</HI> If it was a Work too hard for a
King, how &s;hould the clowni&s;h Impertinent
that I am &s;peaking of do it? Nay, how
&s;hould he be the Agent upon him&s;elf, me|tamorphi&s;e
him&s;elf, and turn him&s;elf, not
<HI>in&s;ide out,</HI> for that he does every Day, but
turn him&s;elf <HI>out&s;ide in,</HI> from a conceited
Pur&s;e-proud
Shop-Keeper
turn him&s;elf into
a Gentleman? Much ea&s;ier might he get an
<HI>Actaeon</HI> &s;et upon his Shoulders, than a Stock
of Brains put into his Head, <HI>Mode&s;ty</HI> upon
his Face, or <HI>Manners</HI> upon his Behaviour.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>be that as it will,</HI> there's no Remedy,
he will call him&s;elf a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and will
thru&s;t him&s;elf into the Company of &s;uch,
that he may at lea&s;t be thought &s;o by others:
But what Pen can de&s;cribe, what Tongue ex|pre&s;s
the nau&s;eous, offen&s;ive, contemptible
Appearance, which he makes there? How
do the Gentlemen commi&s;erate their own
<PB N="248" REF="264">
Condition, when he comes in? Who can
conceive the general Di&s;order it puts them
into? How they look upon and condole with
one another, for &s;poiling their Company,
and marring their Mirth with the un&s;uitable
Society of a Scoundrel? how they con&s;ult in
what Manner to be be&s;t rid of him? and
how they wi&s;h for a Law to e&s;tabli&s;h the
ju&s;t &s;orting Mankind, and ranging them in|to
Cla&s;&s;es, as the re&s;t of God's Creatures are,
where among the very Bea&s;ts and Fowls,
they a&s;&s;ociate in Kinds, and <HI>Birds of a Fea|ther
flock together?</HI></P>
<P>STRANGE that the &s;en&s;itive Life &s;hould
enjoy a better Regimen than the Rational:
We don't &s;ee the Sheep herd with the Dogs,
e&s;pecially with <HI>Mungrels,</HI> or the Deer with
the Hounds; the generous Hor&s;e hates to
graze with the long-ear'd
abject Ass; and the
maje&s;tick Lyon abhors to &s;ociate with that
Emblem of a Churl, the <HI>Bear.</HI></P>
<P>BUT among Men, where the Difference is
infinitely greater, the &s;ordid teizing Mecha|nick,
tru&s;ted by Heaven with a little more
Money than his Neighbours, borrows the
Feathers of the Gay, the Polite, the Manly,
and the Mannerly; and in &s;pite of Nature,
and his Want of Brains, claims not to pa&s;s
for what he is, but for what he neither is,
or is capable to be.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="265">
IF &s;uitable Society is a heavenly Life,
Heaven guard us all from that evident
Plague of Nature, that State of Life which
is the immediately contrary to all human Fe|licity,
<HI>viz.</HI> being unequally match'd: Con|ver&s;ation
is certainly the Glory of a Man,

the Man of Letters and the Stupid, the

Mouth of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Swale</HI>
of <HI>Medway,</HI> and
being rudely &s;eiz'd by the Crew of a Fi&s;h|ing-Smack,
was brought up in a barbarous
Triumph to <HI>Fever&s;ham.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN his Maje&s;ty was there, though he
was taken out of the Hands of tho&s;e dirty
Fellows that fir&s;t &s;eiz'd him, and u&s;ed him
as I care not to remember; he found him|&s;elf
in the Hands of a yet more dangerous
Sort of People, the Rabble, who, upon the
Noi&s;e of the King's being taken, as they
call'd it, throng'd from all Parts of the
Country to <HI>Fever&s;ham;</HI> &s;o that the King
found him&s;elf &s;urrounded, as it were, with
an Army of Furies, the whole Street, which
<PB N="251" REF="267">
is very wide and large, being fill'd, and
Thou&s;ands of the noi&s;y Gentry got toge|ther,
for they knew not what, and, not un|likely,
to do they knew not what.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty, who knew well enough the
Temper of the People at that Time, but
not what they might be pu&s;h'd upon to do
at &s;uch a Juncture, when the whole Nation
was in a Ferment, was very unea&s;y, as well
he might, and &s;poke to &s;ome of the Gen|tlemen,
who came with more Re&s;pect, and
more like them&s;elves to the Town upon
that &s;urpri&s;ing Occa&s;ion: The King told
them he was in their Hands, and was con|tent
to be &s;o, and they might do what they
would with him; but whatever they thought
fit to do with him, he de&s;ired they would
quiet the People, and not let him be de|liver'd
up to the Rabble to be torn to
Pieces.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen told his Maje&s;ty they
were &s;orry to &s;ee him u&s;ed &s;o ill, and they
would do any thing that was in their Power
to protect him; but that it was not po&s;&s;ible
for them to quel the Tumult of the People;
they &s;hould rather be in Danger, of being
torn to Pieces for Papi&s;ts, and the like.</P>
<P>THE King di&s;tre&s;s'd to the la&s;t Degree
with the In&s;ults of the Street; the People
&s;houting, and hollowing, and pre&s;&s;ing to
have the Door open'd in a really frightful
<PB N="252" REF="268">
Manner; At length, his Maje&s;ty ob&s;erving
a mighty bu&s;y forward Gentleman (as he
&s;eemed to be) among the Crowd, who run
about from one Party to another, hollow|ing,
and animating the People, heading the
Mob, and, as it were, leading them on to
a Charge, &s;haking his Hat, and calling to
the People to hollow, and the like, accord|ing
to the Street-U&s;age
in other Ca&s;es; the
King &s;ent a Gentleman to him to bring him
in, and tell him his Maje&s;ty de&s;ir'd to &s;peak
with him.</P>
<P>THE Me&s;&s;age was deliver'd with all po&s;|&s;ible
Civility, and the little <HI>Ma&s;&s;inello</HI> was
prevail'd with to come up Stairs: The King
receiv'd him with a Courte&s;y rather equal
to his pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances than to his
Dignity, and began to argue with him; told
him what he was doing might have an Event
wor&s;e than he intended; that he &s;eemed to
be Heating the People up for &s;ome Mi&s;|chief,
which perhaps he did not fore&s;ee;
and that as he had done him no immediate
per&s;onal Wrong, why &s;hould he attack
him in this Manner; that he was in their
Hands, and they might do what they pleas'd
with him; but he hop'd they did not de&s;ign
to murder him.</P>
<P>THE Fellow &s;tood, as it were, Thunder|&s;truck
with the Awe of Maje&s;ty, and &s;aid
not one Word; but the King went on &s;peak|ing
<PB N="253" REF="269">
to him, and told him, he found he had
&s;ome Influence on the Rabble, and de&s;ir'd
him that he would pacify them, and quiet
them; that Me&s;&s;engers were gone to <HI>London,</HI>
to the Parliament at <HI>London;</HI> and that he
de&s;ir'd only they would be quiet till they
return'd.</P>
<P>THE King knew nothing of the Man,
what he was, or who he was; perhaps if
he had, he would not have &s;pent &s;o much
Pains upon him, much le&s;s did his Maje&s;ty
know that it was a Pur&s;e-proud Country
Shop-Keeper; but that by-the-by, the Sto|ry's
very &s;hort.</P>
<P>WHAT the Fellow an&s;wer'd to the King
I know not; but as I immediately enquir'd,
they told me he did not &s;ay much but this;
<HI>What can I do with them? and what would
you have me do with them?</HI> but as &s;oon as
the King had done &s;peaking to him, he
turn'd &s;hort, and made to the Door as fa&s;t
as he could, to go out of the Room.</P>
<P>UPON that, one of the Gentlemen &s;poke
to him to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e, <HI>very civilly,</HI> and
began to u&s;e &s;ome Argument with him: He
an&s;wered him, like a true Churl, with In&s;o|lence,
and to the la&s;t Degree rude, like him&s;elf,
<HI>Don't talk to me,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>about it; what can
I do?</HI> and &s;o goes on to the Stairs. As &s;oon as
he was got fairly to the Stair-Head,
and
&s;aw his Way open, he turns &s;hort about to
the Gentlemen, and rai&s;ing his Voice &s;o
<PB N="254" REF="270">
that the King, who was but in the next
Room, &s;hould be &s;ure to hear him, &s;ays he,
<HI>I have a Bag of Money as long as my Arm,</HI>
HOLLOW, <HI>Boys,</HI> HOLLOW.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> THE King was &s;o filled with Con|tempt
and ju&s;t Indignation, at the mean
low-&s;pirited In&s;olence of the <HI>Pur&s;e|proud</HI>
Wretch, that it quite took off the
Horror of the Rabble, which was too
much upon his Mind before, and
his Maje&s;ty only <HI>&s;inil'd,</HI> and &s;at
down, and &s;aid, <HI>Let them alone, let
them do their wor&s;t.</HI> But that by the
Way, the Story I know per&s;onally to
be true.</Q>
<P>THE Example, I think, &s;erves my Pur|po&s;e
exactly, and lets you &s;ee the true Pic|ture
of a Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;man; for this
Man was a Country <HI>Grocer,</HI> not in <HI>Fe|ver&s;ham,</HI>
but in a little Village in the ad|jacent
Country: After this &s;hort Hi&s;tory,
I need &s;ay no more by way of Character
about it.</P>
<P>BUT I cannot conclude it without giving
my Compleat Trade&s;man a Caution again&s;t
the Temper: To be a rich Trade&s;man is de&s;i|rable;
but to be vain of the mere Wealth as
&s;uch, is a Token of the greate&s;t Meanne&s;s
of Spirit that Mankind is or can be capable
<PB N="255" REF="271">
of; 'tis a Ba&s;ene&s;s of Soul below a rational
Creature; 'tis like a Boar, who is &s;urly and
mi&s;chevious only becau&s;e he is fat; when it
is certain that he is fed up to that ungo|vernable
Height and Heat of his Blood
only to have his Throat cut, and make the
larger Brawn.</P>
<P>OF all the Mi&s;takes of a Trade&s;man's
Life, I mean after that of breaking, and
turning Bankrupt is pa&s;t Danger, this of
being Pur&s;e-proud
is the wor&s;t, and with the
utmo&s;t Diligence to be avoided by the
Trade&s;men; 'tis what expo&s;es him mo&s;t to
the ju&s;t Scorn and Contempt of the World,
at lea&s;t of the wi&s;er Part of it, and making
tho&s;e Men &s;ick of him, that it &s;hould be
his Honour to be agreeable to.</P>
<P>NOR is it an expo&s;ing him only, but it
is particularly his Di&s;a&s;ter, in that, it ex|po&s;es
him at that Time of his Life when
his Character &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;h'd; when
the Intere&s;t he &s;hould have among the be&s;t
Men &s;hould begin, and when what Reputa|tion
he gains would be &s;ure to &s;tay with
him; when being well received among even
his Superiors, and honour'd among his E|quals
and Inferiors, he &s;hould go with the
utmo&s;t Plea&s;ure through the Remainder of
Life, and enjoy all that the World could give,
or the Deity de&s;ign'd for making a Man of
his Station compleatly happy.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="272">
IF then the Trade&s;man would go on in
his Bu&s;ine&s;s chearfully, and go out of it
comfortably; if he would be e&s;teemed
when in Trade, and valued and wellaccepted-in
the World, when out of Trade;
if he would be u&s;eful to others and to him|&s;elf,
be honoured by the Poor, and be agree|able
to the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of Men; if he
would go through the World with Ap|plau&s;e,
and out of it with Satisfaction; ob|tain
a good E&s;teem when alive, and leave
a good Report behind him when he is dead;
let him of all the Errors of Life, I mean
re&s;pecting Mankind, avoid this as the wor&s;t;
as the mo&s;t &s;candalous, mo&s;t offen&s;ive, and
mo&s;t ridiculous Thing he can ever be guil|ty

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Trade&s;man being quarrel&s;ome and

his Neighbours.</HEAD>
<P>_OF all the Signals of a Pur&s;|roud
Trade&s;man,
I know none more in|fallible
than this, of his being quar|rel&s;ome
and litigious among his Neigh|bours
<PB N="257" REF="273">
and Cu&s;tomers, to catch at every Ad|vantage,
to wrangle without Rea&s;on, quar|rel
without Provocation, di&s;pute Trifles,
and go to Law without Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>IT is u&s;ual to &s;ay, when we &s;ee a Man
fond of going to Law, that he does not know
what to do with his Money; he that will
&s;eek Ju&s;tice in the Law, ought to be fir&s;t
very &s;ure he can obtain Ju&s;tice no other
Way: The Law was not de&s;ign'd to &s;et Peo|ple
together by the Ears, but to prevent it:
He that &s;eeks his Remedy by Law, that may
have his Right by Treaty, makes the Law
a Stalking-hor&s;e
to his Pa&s;&s;ions, and is as
much guilty of Violence, as he that takes
his Right by Force.</P>
<P>GOING to Law for a Debt, tho' the Debt
be ju&s;t, before all due and chri&s;tian Mea|fures
are made u&s;e of to obtain Right by fair
Means, that is, by peaceable Methods, is ta|king
your Neighbour by the Throat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a Thing, tho' not expre&s;ly forbidden, yet
left as an Example of ungrateful Fury and
Rage, and a Mark of Infamy left on it, as a
Brand of Heaven's Di&s;like.</P>
<P>IF we talk of Heaven and our Maker,
we are all Bankrupts, in&s;olvent Debtors, and
unable to pay, no not the lowe&s;t Compo&s;i|tion;
and if our great Creditor had not found
out a merciful Method for an imputed Pay|ment,
we mu&s;t have all gone to Jail, 'till
we had paid the uttermo&s;t Farthing: And
<PB N="258" REF="274">
is it for us then to take our Neighbour <HI>by
the Throat?</HI> and with Rage and Fury cry,
pay me what thou owe&s;t me? where's the
Gratitude of it to him that forgave the great
Debt? where the Compa&s;&s;ion which we had
&s;o much need of our&s;elves?</P>
<P>BUT if there is &s;uch a Brand of Cruelty
and Ingratitude upon our violent exacting,
even our ju&s;t Due, what then is the Charac|ter
of him that u&s;es Violence with Inju&s;tice
too? Injurious Violence is but a legal Rob|bery;
for without que&s;tion, taking, what
we call the Advantages of the Law, may be
as much a Violence as breaking up a Hou&s;e;
and tho' the Letter of the Law may be in
their Favour, yet Con&s;cience, and Ju&s;tice,
and hone&s;t Dealing, would deter a fairdealing
Man from it.</P>
<P>THERE is a Court of Chancery in every
Man's Brea&s;t, and every Man is Judge in
that Court, even for him&s;elf; whatever it
may be in other Ca&s;es, there a Man is al|low'd
to be Judge in his own Cafe; but the
Rea&s;on is plain, as Con&s;cience is Lord Chan|cellor,
he can't help determining the Cau&s;e
impartially within him&s;elf; and whether it
be right or wrong on his Side, whether for
him or again&s;t him, the &s;ecret Judge within
will tell him very faithfully how it &s;tands,
and what ought to be done.</P>
<P>IF he will not liften to what that Judge
&s;ays to him, if he will not acknowledge
<PB N="259" REF="275">
the Juri&s;diction of the Court, and &s;ubmit to
the Sentence pronounced, that is another
Ca&s;e quite, he takes that upon him&s;elf, and
the Judge of that &s;ecret Court of Chan|cery
will appeal to a higher Bar; as a Man
appeals here from the Lord Chancellor's De|cree
to the Judgment of the Hou&s;e of Lords;
only with this Difference, that here the
Chancellor appeals again&s;t the Client, there
the Client appeals again&s;t the Chancellor;
the Judge appeals again&s;t the Criminal, not
the Criminal again&s;t the Judge.</P>
<P>NOw let the Trade&s;man I am &s;peaking to,
bring this home to him&s;elf: Before he goes
to Law with his Debtor or Dealer, let him
try the Cau&s;e in Equity in his own Brea&s;t;
let him ask the Opinion of his own Law|yer,
(I may &s;ay Lawgiver,) the Lord Chan|cellor
of his own Heart, I mean Con&s;cience;
and let him take heed when he has done
&s;o, that he takes the Coun&s;el there given
him.</P>
<P>IT is a high Affront to a Coun&s;ellor at
Law, to ask his Advice, and then not fol|low
it; 'tis like &s;ending for a Phy&s;ician, and
then refu&s;ing his Medicines; and they who
are &s;o us'd, generally think them&s;elves ob|lig'd
to ju&s;tify the Advice they gave.</P>
<P>HE that con&s;ults his own Con&s;cience, and
then refu&s;es to li&s;ten to its Direction; that

may expect its Re&s;entment; it will ap|peal
again&s;t him el&s;ewhere, and ju&s;tify the
Equity of the Sentence even in his Face.</P>
<P>HE that thus acts in Contempt of the ju&s;t
Sentence within, and will pur&s;ue his Rage
and Revenge again&s;t another, becau&s;e he
has the Advantage over him by &s;ome Neg|lect
on one Side, or Di&s;a&s;ter on the other,
mu&s;t expect the Appeal of Con&s;cience in its
Turn, and tho' the oppre&s;s'd Debtor may
not obtain Relief, may be made to pay

the Oppre&s;&s;or is behind, and may be expect|ed.

<P>BUT perhaps this is too grave for the
Times; the quarrel&s;ome Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;|man
I &s;peak of, is got into the Law, and he's
above Go&s;pel; he has an Advantage which
the <HI>Devil</HI> has put into his Hands, and he will
make his Market of it; as for going to the
<HI>Devil</HI> for it, let the <HI>Devil</HI> and him alone
to agree about that, give him the Money,
he has no more to &s;ay about Con&s;cience, and
the &s;ecret Reproof within him&s;elf; he can
get over all that his own Way, 'tis &s;a|tisfying
his Avarice and Revenge that he
is bent upon: I have him fa&s;t, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and
<PB N="261" REF="277">
I'll follow him, I'll warrant you; I'll pu&s;h him
Home, I'll ruin him; he &s;hall pay me every
Penny, Charges and all, or he &s;han't &s;tand
at his Shop|oor.</P>
<P>WELL but &s;ays a peaceable Neighbour,
that goes between them, don't be &s;o warm;
it may be you have an Advantage again&s;t
the poor Man: He did owe your Father &s;o
much Money indeed, but he declares he paid
him 200 <HI>l.</HI> of it in &s;everal Payments, and
his Books make it appear; but two of the
Receipts are lo&s;t, he cannot find them; his
Apprentice is gone beyond Sea, who kept
his Ca&s;h, and kept the Receipts and other
Papers, and the Receipts are mi&s;&s;ing; &s;ure
you won't take the Advantage of &s;uch a
Thing.</P>
<P>NOT take the Advantage! &s;ays he again;
why not take every ju&s;t Advantage, to ob|tain
my Right?</P>
<P>AY, but Sir, &s;ays the other, you mu&s;t
needs know that you had the Money.</P>
<P>I KNOW! &s;ays the Trade&s;man; I know
nothing but black and white; if I had the
Money, to be &s;ure he had my Receipt.</P>
<P>WELL, &s;ays the Peace-Maker, and &s;o he
had, no doubt; but it is mi&s;laid.</P>
<P>MISLAID! &s;ays the K&mdash;; don't tell me,
Trade&s;men never mi&s;lay Receipts, and of
&s;uch a Con&s;equence too.</P>
<P>WELL, but Sir, &s;ays the Peace-Maker,
will you &s;hew your own Books? What if it
<PB N="262" REF="278">
&s;hould appear to be enter'd there? No doubt
you keep Books as well as other Men, and if
you have receiv'd the Money&mdash;</P>
<P>HERE he interrupts him haughtily, and
rai&s;ing his Voice &s;ays, what d'ye mean by
that? what are my Books to make up his
Accompts? Sure I keep my Books for my
own U&s;e, and he keeps his Books for his
U&s;e.</P>
<P>I don't know Sir, <HI>&s;ays the good Peace-Maker,</HI>
what you may keep your Books for;
but an hone&s;t Man will never refu&s;e to &s;hew
his Books in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as this.</P>
<P>WELL, well, I am as hone&s;t as he: He
pretends to &s;ay, he has paid this 200 <HI>l.</HI> but
has nothing to &s;hew for it: What mu&s;t I
take his Say|&s;o
for Payment: I tell you Sir,
I will allow my own Hand to a Receipt, if
he can produce it; if he can't, the Law will
not &s;uppo&s;e the Money was ever paid, nor
&s;hall I allow it.</P>
<P>THAT very &s;evere, &s;ays the Peace-Maker:
But Sir, adds he, Let me ask one Fa|vour
of you in behalf of this innocent Suf|ferer?
You won't &s;hew your Books, you
&s;ay, to &s;et it to rights.</P>
<P>NO I wont, Sir, &s;ays the Trade&s;man; he
has nothing to do with my Books.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, replies the other, Grant me
one Thing, however, about your Books.</P>
<P>WHAT that, pray?</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279">
Why &s;hew 'em your &s;elf; look into them
fairly, and &s;ee whether this Money does not
appear fairly enter'd there at &s;uch and &s;uch a
Time.</P>
<P>AND what then? what would you make
of that? &s;ays the Trade&s;man, jeering.</P>
<P>NOTHING Sir, nothing, &s;ays the Peace-Maker;
only look in them, promi&s;e me
that.</P>
<P>I NEED not promi&s;e you that, &s;ays the
Trade&s;man, I look in my Books every Day.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, I &s;ay no more, only look par|ticularly
into this Man's Account, and I'll
be &s;atisfied with one Thing that will certain|ly
follow: When you &s;ee the Money made
receiv'd in your Ca&s;h, only ask your &s;elf,
Whether it is hone&s;t and fair for you to de|mand
it again?</P>
<P><HI>Ask my &s;elf!</HI> a pretty Story to put off a
Debt; I tell you I ask him for the Money,
and I'll have it too: I am &s;ure enough,
if he has no Receipt, I have had no Pay|ment.</P>
<P>WELL, do but look in your Books, &s;ays the
Peace|aker,
and &s;ee if the Money won't
&s;tare in your Face there: Try the Cau&s;e
before your own Con&s;cience; I warrant you
'twill go again&s;t you; you'll be ca&s;t in that
Court.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;ays the Trade&s;man, if you come
to preach, I have done with you: I'll &s;end
for you when I want a Par&s;on; at pre&s;ent
<PB N="264" REF="280">
I have no Occa&s;ion; Im not &s;ick Sir: I
ha'n't &s;ent for the Doctor yet; and we always
con&s;ult the Doctor before the Prie&s;t.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, &s;ays the Peace-Maker, you may
je&s;t with your Friends, but don't je&s;t with
your &s;elf; you may want the Doctor and the
Par&s;on too in due Time: But in the mean
Time, you may want good Advice; and
mine is no bad Coun&s;el, u&s;e it as you will.</P>
<P>AY, ay, I'll u&s;e it as I will, &s;ays the
Trade&s;man; in the mean Time I want my
Money, and my Money I'll have, or I
know my Way, I'll take my Cour&s;e for
it.</P>
<P>NO Sir, &s;ays the Peace-Maker, you
don't want your Money, you want his Mo|ney;
it is not yours; I am fully &s;atis&s;ied you
have had yours already.</P>
<Q><P>UPON this they parted; the Trade&s;man
&s;ued the poor Man for the 200<HI>l.</HI> and got
a Verdict again&s;t him; but the poor
Debtor brought his Bill in Chancery,
and made &s;uch Circum&s;tances appear,
as that the Chancellor granted him an
Injunction again&s;t Proceedings, till
Time might be had to &s;end over to
his Apprentice, who was gone to <HI>New
England,</HI> to know of him what he
could &s;ay to it.</P>
<P>UPON the Return to this Letter, the
young Man, who was then for him|&s;elf,
<PB N="265" REF="281">
recollected the Thing, and &s;ent
over an Affidavit before proper Per|&s;ons,
and atte&s;ted in Form by a Notary
Publick, that he paid the Money, and
nam'd &s;everal Circum&s;tances too which
much confirm'd it.</P>
<P>BUT with the re&s;t he &s;ent over Direc|tions
to &s;earch among &s;ome Papers
which he had left with his other Goods
at a Relation's Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> inti|mating,
that he believed the Receipts
would be found there.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, upon &s;earching the Pa|pers,
there were the two Receipts found
under the Trade&s;man's own Hand; up|on
producing which the unju&s;t Trade&s;|man
was fairly, but (to him) &s;hamefully,
ca&s;t, and decreed to pay the Charges
of Suit, as well in Chancery as in Com|mon
Law, and other Damages al&s;o,
to no le&s;s a Sum altogether, than be|tween
thirty or forty Pound, be&s;ides
his own Charges.</P></Q>
<P>I might give many Examples of like
Inju&s;tice, whereby Bills, Receipts, or Bonds,
having been lo&s;t, or burnt, or de&s;troy'd, the
Money has been lo&s;t, and the unju&s;t Plain|tiff
has made no Scruple of pur&s;uing ea|gerly
for the Money that had been fairly
paid before; but they are too long for this
Work.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="282">
BUT I come nearer to the Trade&s;man's
Con&s;cience than this &s;till; and I &s;ay, though
the Debt be ju&s;t, though the Defendant does
not di&s;pute the Payment, but perhaps di&s;|putes
&s;ome particular Circum&s;tances in the
Demand, &s;ome promi&s;ed Abatement, &s;ome
Defect in the Goods, &s;ome trifling Objec|tion;
and perhaps both Sides are litigious,
quarrel&s;ome, Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;men; I
&s;ay they both come under the ju&s;t Reproof,
and they ought rather to yield &s;mall Mat|ters
on one Hand, or perhaps on both
Hands, rather than pu&s;h at one another
with Violence: If they want Temper, if
they are equally warm, equally opiniated
of being right, let them chu&s;e Peace-Makers,
refer their Di&s;putes to indifferent
and moderate Judges between them, and
make up Trifles by peaceable-minded
Men,
that they may avoid Trouble and Law-Charges.</P>
<P>THIS
is when two litigious, quarrelling,
Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;men meet; when both
are haughty and outrageous, po&s;itive and
ob&s;tinate: It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, when &s;uch
do fall out, and fall upon one another, we
are apt to &s;ay, that they are well match'd;
that let them fight it out; they have either
of them Money enough, and no body pities
them; let them tire them&s;elves a little, and
when they have both felt the Expence of
it, they will grow cool.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="283">
BUT as I am directing my&s;elf to the foo|li&s;h
rich Trade&s;man, 'tis not that they &s;hould
be fooli&s;h. on Purpo&s;e to make Sport to
tho&s;e that are wi&s;er; but it is to &s;hew them
the Folly of it, that they may grow wi&s;er
them&s;elves: I have heard of two Trade&s;|men
that fell out thus about the Pack-cloth
that
a Parcel of Goods were deliver'd in,
that is to &s;ay, &s;ent down into the Country
in: The Country Shop-Keeper
bought &s;uch
and &s;uch Goods at a Whole&s;ale-draper's
or
Mercer's, or &s;ome &s;uch Trade&s;man in <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and went home, leaving the Whole|&s;ale
Man to &s;end the Goods down after
him.</P>
<P>1. THE Warehou&s;e Man accordingly makes
up the Goods in three Bales or Parcels, and
&s;ends them down by the Carrier. Two In|cidents
happen upon this Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THEY had made no Capitulation about
what the Goods &s;hould be pack'd up in;
but the Whole&s;ale Man taking him&s;elf to
be left at Liberty, packs &s;ome of the finer
Goods in a Ca&s;e or Che&s;t, and the re&s;t in
Canvas, and charges &s;even Shillings for
the Ca&s;e, and twelve Shillings for the Can|vas.</P>
<P>2. THEY had neither of them thought of
what Carrier to &s;end them by, there being
two Carriers who carried Goods to the &s;ame
Town; one who was the ordinary Carrier
of the Place, and one who only went thro'
<PB N="268" REF="284">
the Town to another Town forty Miles be|yond
it; the latter, it &s;eems, was the Car|rier
which the Country Trade&s;man made
u&s;e of; but he had not po&s;itively directed
his Goods to be &s;ent by him; and the other
being, as is &s;aid, the ordinary Carrier of the
Place; the Trade&s;man in <HI>London</HI> thought he
was the Man, and &s;o deliver'd the Goods
to him.</P>
<P>IN the Journey the Carrier met with a
Di&s;a&s;ter; the Weather was exceeding wet;
extraordinary ha&s;ty Rains happened, and the
Waters were out, and &s;o high, that going
through a River which was u&s;ually pa&s;&s;able,
the Water came into the Waggon, and the
Goods, e&s;pecially tho&s;e in the Che&s;t, or Ca&s;e,
were damag'd very much.</P>
<P>THE Country Chap, a rich Pur&s;e-proud
Trade&s;man,
quarrels at both the&s;e Articles;
he would not pay for the Ca&s;e or the Can|vas
that the Goods were pack'd in; he
bought the Goods, and he expected to have
tho&s;e Things thrown in, as Paper and Pack|thread
is thrown into &s;maller Things, and
Things &s;old by Retail: At be&s;t, he would
return the Che&s;t and the Canvas, but he
would not pay for them.</P>
<P>THEN as to the Carrier: The Goods were
not &s;ent by his Carrier, and he had not or|dered
them to be &s;ent by the other, and he
would not &s;tand to the Damage that had
<PB N="269" REF="285">
happen'd, and &s;o would not receive the
Goods.</P>
<P>HERE was a double Quarrel, and not
very ea&s;y to determine which was right, and
which was wrong; in fact, it &s;eemed both
were right, and both were wrong; that is,
the Country Trade&s;man was right in the
la&s;t, and the City Trade&s;man in the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>IT matters not to my Purpo&s;e to try the
Cau&s;e here; but take it which Way you
will, the Con&s;equence was much the &s;ame:
They went on, &s;pent a great deal of Money,
even more than the Goods were worth; at
la&s;t one of them died; the Executors had
more Wit, and the &s;urviving Trade&s;man
was out of Breath; and &s;o the Suit ended
to the Damage of both, un&s;peakably.</P>
<P>NOW were it only thus; were this litigious
Pur&s;e-proud
Temper only to happen among
tho&s;e of the &s;ame fort, I confe&s;s the Grie|vance
would be the le&s;s: But how often
does the haughty Creature, who has neither
Rea&s;on or Compa&s;&s;ion to &s;teer his Actions,
but who is hurried on by his Pride and In&s;o|lence
only? I &s;ay, how often does he vent
his Fire, and let loo&s;e his Pride upon the
innocent, quiet, well-meaning
Trade&s;man,
falling upon him upon every Occa&s;ion in
Trade, and quarrelling upon every Occa|&s;ion
out of Trade, nay, even without Oc|ca&s;ion,
and watching and waiting for an
Occa&s;ion?</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="286">
ALL this points, indeed, at the &s;can|dalous
Creature, de&s;crib'd in our la&s;t Chap|ter,
and it is his Due, and much more: But
I would have this Chapter be directed ano|ther
Way, namely, to the young Trade&s;|man,
who is coming forward in Bu&s;ine&s;s,
thriving, and in a fair Way to be a rich
Trade&s;man: I would have him be the Man
I aim at, and wi&s;h for, <HI>viz.</HI> a Compleat
Trade&s;man; and he that is &s;o, will care|fully
avoid the Extreme I am &s;peaking of,
and never be either vain of his good For|tune,
or quarrel&s;ome and litigious in the
enjoying it.</P>
<P>PRIDE is the Vice of a long Pur&s;e; he
that in Bu&s;ine&s;s has the Money, and not
the Corruption, is my Compleat Trade&s;|man;
indeed he alone is the happy Man in
Trade: To &s;ee a Trade&s;man rich and hum|ble,
is to &s;ee one of the &s;tanch Supports of
the Government, and of the whole Nation
in general: No Nation in the World has
more Trade&s;men than <HI>England,</HI> or &s;o many
wealthy, rich, and truly honourable Per&s;ons
in Trade, or &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s upon their
Hands: But there are &s;ome among them at
the &s;ame Time that have the Vices with the
Virtue, the Salt with the Fre&s;h.</P>
<P>TO be Pur&s;e-Proud in Trade is the &s;ame Vice
in its Sphere, as to be conceited in Wit; only
with this Difference, that the Trade&s;man
has frequently the Pur&s;e that he is proud
<PB N="271" REF="287">
of; but the Fop is generally conceited of
the Wit which he has not.</P>
<P>INDEED, &s;ometimes we &s;ee a mo&s;t in|congruous,
mon&s;trous Piece of trading Fop|pery,
<HI>viz.</HI> we &s;ee a Trade&s;man Pur&s;e-proud,
and not have the Pur&s;e neither; the Man
fir&s;t fancies him&s;elf rich, and then indulges
the Vanity of it: Such a Man may be &s;aid
to be proud of the Pur&s;e without the Mo|ney.
Of tho&s;e, I think, I may &s;ay, turn|ing
his Lines a little, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> &s;aid
to Poet <HI>Shadwell,</HI> who charg'd him with
being conceited and proud of his Parts; Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI> &s;eems to grant it, and replies thus:
<Q><L>Our Pride of Wit and Parts may be an Evil,</L>
<L>But to be proud of Non&s;en&s;e, <HI>that's the Devil.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>TURN the Tables to our Trade&s;man,
who is Pur&s;e-proud and yet poor, and it
will run thus:
<Q><L>Pride of the &s;welling Bags may be an Evil,</L>
<L>But to be Poor and Pur&s;e-proud, that's the
Devil.</L></Q></P>
<P>AND to carry on the Allu&s;ion a little
farther: As the conceited <HI>Would-be-Wit</HI> is
generally a Fool, or, to &s;peak &s;paringly of
him, a weak Man, &s;o it is in Trade; take
the Pur&s;e-proud Trade&s;men, and generally
&s;peaking, they are not among the bright
<PB N="272" REF="288">
Men, not the Compleat Trade&s;men: He is
quite another Man; his Conduct is quite
differing; the Compleat Trade&s;man is a
Man of too much Sen&s;e, he under&s;tands
himself better; and to bring it directly to
the Ca&s;e in hand:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HE under&s;tands him&s;elf better than to
be continually embarra&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in
Suits at Law; falling upon his Fellow|Trade&s;men
with Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion, ma|king
Quarrels for the &s;ake of them,
and pur&s;uing Advantages as if he liv'd
by them; 'tis quite out of his Way;
he does not reli&s;h Strife.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. HE under&s;tands Trade better than to
pu&s;h every Debtor to Extremity, and
tear Men to Pieces ju&s;t when he knows
they cannot an&s;wer his Demand; when
he knows that by Patience, and a lit|tle
Forbearance, the Debt may be got
in, that by Violence would be at lea&s;t
in Danger of being lo&s;t.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. HE knows the Value of his Money
better than to throw it away in Pro&s;e|cutions
at Law for Trifles; in which
he knows he that gets the Victory, al|ways
is a Lo&s;er: He works too hard
for his Money, and gets it with too
much Care and Application, to make
<HI>Ducks and Drakes</HI> of it when he has
done, and throw it away in Gratifica|tion
<PB N="273" REF="289">
of his common Re&s;entment: He'll
never go to Law for the Pack-cloth
'till he &s;pends the Parcel, or fell his
Cu&s;tomer for an empty Box.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THERE cannot be a greater Te&s;timony
of the Decay of a Trade&s;man's Under&s;tand|ing,
or of his real Deficiency of Brains, than
this of his being litigious, and apt to quar|rel;
taking Advantage of every Man, and
pu&s;hing tho&s;e Advantages, whether ju&s;t or
unju&s;t, awing and terrifying poor Men to Ex|tremities
with <HI>going to Law,</HI> for even Di&s;re|&s;pect;
making Men Offenders for Words,
and threatning them with Bags of Money,
their Hundreds and Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>AS nothing but a Man of bad Parts, or
bad Principles can delight in making him|&s;elf
Terror and Plague to the Country
round him, &s;o he has the Reward of it;
he is &s;ure to be fir&s;t hated, then &s;hunn'd,
and at la&s;t de&s;pis'd; when fir&s;t they
fear him, they naturally hate him: But
when the Fear abates, and they &s;ee him,
like the Devil, not &s;o terrible or &s;o black as
he is painted, they learn to &s;corn and de|&s;pi&s;e
him.</P>
<P>NOR is this Temper any ea&s;ier to them|&s;elves
than it is to their Neighbours; for they
are every Day impoveri&s;hing them&s;elves to
carry on the litigious Practice; con&s;tant Law-Suits,
and con&s;tant Charges eat them up; and
<PB N="274" REF="290">
tho' they get the better, they are Lo&s;ers by
the Quarrels they rai&s;e.</P>
<P>I knew a Trade&s;man that, generally
&s;peaking, had the&s;e Kinds of Broils always
upon his Hands; and he was the mo&s;t un|ea&s;y
Man alive: He was always alaying
Lawyers
Bills, always reading over Bills in
Chancery exhibited again&s;t him; for 'twas
ob&s;erv'd he was always Plaintiff at common
Law, and Defendant in Chancery; that is
to &s;ay, that he pur&s;ued his Neighbours fir&s;t
upon every flight Advantage, and they al|ways
&s;ought Relief in Equity, and gene|rally
had it too; for he was mo&s;t injurious
in his fir&s;t Preten&s;ions; and he that is &s;o, will
always have the wor&s;t of it in Equity,
whatever he may have at Common Law.</P>
<P>THIS good-humour'd
Citizen, I believe,
&s;pent for &s;ome Years before he left off, 200<HI>l.</HI>
a Year in Law|uits,
and oftentimes he
paid both Plaintiff's and Defendant's Charges,
and very rarely (if ever) got the Money
the Suit co&s;t him; it was well if he came
off without paying double Co&s;t, that is,
their Co&s;t whom he went to Law with, and
his own al&s;o.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was not reduc'd to Poverty
by it; but he was always kept embroil'd
and embarra&s;s'd, and was not &s;o rich by a
great many hundred Pounds, perhaps Thou|&s;ands,
as he would otherwi&s;e have been: At
la&s;t he met with one crabbed Trade&s;man,
<PB N="275" REF="291">
who held him &s;o hard to it, that fir&s;t and
la&s;t it co&s;t him above 300 <HI>l.</HI> and he was ca&s;t
too, and oblig'd to pay Co&s;t on the Defen|dant's
Side; and this Piece of co&s;tly Expe|rience
cur'd him of that quarrel&s;ome Tem|per,
and made him &s;ick of the Law ever
after.</P>
<P>WHO can help wi&s;hing every litigious|temper'd
Trade&s;man the like Succe&s;s in his
quarrelling Proceedings, that we might have
many more &s;uch converted People among
us, that is to &s;ay, that being made wi&s;e by
their own Experience, they might quit the
hateful Di&s;po&s;ition, and live at Peace with
their Fellow-trade&s;men.</P>
<P>IT
is recorded of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that when
they had martial warlike Princes among
them, who by their Conduct enlarg'd their
Empire to the Magnitude we now &s;ee it ar|riv'd
at, they took Care always to be ma|king
War in one Place or other, on one
Side or other, that their Soldiery might not
lo&s;e their Vigour, that their Swords might
not ru&s;t, and that they might not want ex|perienc'd
Officers, or have their Men unexer|cis'd
in the Di&s;cipline; and take them, as they
were, a furious bloody Generation, that
made it their Bu&s;ine&s;s to over-run
the World;
yet they were right to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I think it may very aptly be brought
home to the Trade&s;man I am &s;peaking of:
He is &s;o enur'd to the contentious Habit,
<PB N="276" REF="292">
that if he &s;hould di&s;continue it any Time,
if he &s;hould be condemned to live at Peace
with his Neighbours, he would grow ru&s;ty,
and lo&s;e the Art of di&s;turbing Mankind,
which is, in &s;hort, the chief Enjoyment of
his Life.</P>
<P>A Trade&s;man thus quarrel&s;ome, wran|gling
in every Bargain, di&s;puting every
Tri&s;le, and going to Law for every Di&s;|pute,
living by Differences, and delighting
in Storms and Tempe&s;ts, &s;hould be e&s;teem'd
what we call a common Barreter in the
Law, or as a Scold among the Women; he
&s;hould be pre&s;ented as a publick Nu&s;ance, a
common Di&s;turber of the Neighbourhood;
and, as the Peace|aker,
has the Ble&s;&s;ing
of Heaven, and the Prayers of his Neigh|bours
upon him, &s;o this unea&s;y Creature
&s;eems to be ju&s;t in the contrary Situation,
and ought to expect the contrary from
both.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, he that goes to Law with his
Neighbours for Trifles, that lives in Con|tention
as in his Element, I do not &s;ee why
the famous Engine call'd a <HI>Ducking-stool</HI>
&s;hould
not be as proper an Application to
him, to cool his Pa&s;&s;ion, abate the Venom of
his Blood, and take out the Acrimony of his
Spirits, as it is to a little fiery outrageous
old Woman, that &s;colds Day and Night
merely to open her Pipes.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="293">
'TIS certain, the quarrelling Trade&s;man is a
common publick Grievance in the Country
where he dwells; and as his Conduct, or
rather Want of Conduct, is tormenting to
others, &s;o it is pernicious to him&s;elf; 'tis rui|nous
to his Family, de&s;troys his Sub&s;tance,
makes him hated among his Neighbours,
and in the End, he is vexatious to him&s;elf;
for he eats upon him&s;elf, as Envy is de&s;crib'd
by a Viper gnawing its own Bowels, &s;o 'tis
mo&s;t true in him; for his Envy, which, as
above, is the real Cau&s;e of his quarrel&s;ome
Di&s;po&s;ition, eats in upon him&s;elf, de&s;troys
his Sub&s;tance, which is the vital Strength
of his Bu&s;ine&s;s as a Trade&s;man, and reduces
him in the End to narrow Circum&s;tances,
and perhaps to Poverty.</P>
<P>AND yet &s;o it is; and I mu&s;t take No|tice
of it here, to the Scandal of our unhap|py
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Temper, that even Poverty it|&s;elf
does not put an End to it; and it is to
be &s;een in the Di&s;po&s;ition even of the com|mon
People; I mean the Poor: How are
they almo&s;t continually together by the Ears
among one another for Tri&s;les, and carrying
on their wrangling Tempers by &s;tated
Degrees, ju&s;t as the quarrel&s;ome Trade&s;men
do among their Neighbours.</P>
<P>FIRST they differ a little, and which is
very particular, for little or nothing; then
it makes Words; Words rai&s;e the Pa&s;&s;ions;
then they &s;cold, call Names, and perhaps
<PB N="278" REF="294">
fight; then away to the Ju&s;tice for a War|rant:
If the Ju&s;tice is a good peaceable Gen|tleman,
pities them, and per&s;wades them to
make it up, as is often the Ca&s;e, they fly out
into a Pa&s;&s;ion, and perhaps Rudene&s;s, and away
they go to another Ju&s;tice, and &s;o to ano|ther;
for they will have a Warrant, what|ever
it co&s;ts them.</P>
<P>IF it be Matter of Right and Wrong,
though but to the Value of Sixpence or a
Shilling, away they run to an Officer, and
get a Writ; and I have &s;een a poor Crea|ture,
that wanted Bread, pay &s;ixteen or &s;e|venteen
Shillings for Charges, in pro&s;ecuting
a Debt of Ten Pence or a Shilling.</P>
<P>BUT above all, if it be Matter of Scan|dal;
if in their Fury a hard Word has e|&s;cap'd,
and a hard Name been dropp'd, the
Lawyer is immediately employ'd, the poor
Wretch in Rags arre&s;ts the poor Wretch in
Rags,
<Q>And Beggars &s;pend the Pari&s;h Alms at Law.</Q></P>
<P>IT is true, this is a Digre&s;&s;ion; but it is a
u&s;eful Digre&s;&s;ion; that the litigious Trade&s;|man
may &s;ee the Picture of his Behaviour in
Miniature: Here he may &s;ee the true Plan
of his own Di&s;po&s;ition; and if any Thing
could make an Impre&s;&s;ion upon him, I think
this &s;hould; for as hateful as it is among
<PB N="279" REF="295">
the Poor, &s;o much the more it is among the
Trade&s;men, who live by their Bu&s;ine&s;s, and
who &s;hould be particularly careful to live
peaceably with every Body, becau&s;e they
may be &s;aid indeed to get their Bread by
every Body; and if Contention does not
make them poor, I may venture to &s;ay it
will never make them rich.</P>
<P>I believe no Trade&s;man will ever get an
E&s;tate by pulling other Trade&s;men in Pieces;
and if he did, it is a horrid Way of encrea&s;ing
his Wealth; A contentious Humour certainly
tends to wa&s;te the Trade&s;man, not to en|crea&s;e
him: It is true, he wa&s;tes tho&s;e he
quarrels with; and that may be &s;ome Part
of his Satisfaction; and a wretched Satisfac|tion
it is; but it will in the End wa&s;te him|&s;elf
too: Wherefore, upon the whole, I
think the ble&s;&s;ed A po&s;tle's Rule, as it was
good and whol&s;ome for tho&s;e he wrote to,
'tis &s;till more &s;o to a Trade&s;man, <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 15.
<HI>If it be po&s;&s;ible, as much as lieth in you, live
peaceably with all Men.</HI> I &s;hall pur&s;ue the
Advice for the curing this Pe&s;tilence of
Trade in the next Chapter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="280" REF="296">
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade&s;man's avoiding Law-Suits
and Contention in Bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;tudying
to live peaceably with his Neighbours,
e&s;pecially in Matters of Trade.</HEAD>
<P>_WHAT has been &s;aid in the la&s;t
Chapters points at the two mo&s;t &s;can|dalous
Parts of a Trade&s;man's Life,
the grand Vices of a thriving Trade&s;man,
<HI>viz.</HI> his being impertinently Pur&s;e-proud,
and his being vexatious and quarrel&s;ome:
'Tis to be hop'd, it may be &s;ufficient to cau|tion
a Trade&s;man of Sen&s;e and Mode&s;ty from
falling into either of tho&s;e Snares, both fatal
to his Character, and both rendering him a
Burden and Offence to the World, as far as
his narrow Circle can extend.</P>
<P>I would now turn to the better|anag'd
Trade&s;man;
who beginning-well, de&s;ires to
go on &s;o; who endeavours to mind his Bu|&s;ine&s;s,
follow what is before him, and di|&s;turb
no Body: As he is caution'd again&s;t
the quarrel&s;ome Temper, and the Pur&s;e|proud
Excur&s;ions of the other, by the odious
Example, &s;o let me turn to him with Per|&s;wa&s;ions
for the re&s;t of his Conduct, drawn
<PB N="281" REF="297">
from &s;uch Arguments as wife Men will al|ways
li&s;ten to.</P>
<P>FOR his own &s;ake, for his Family's &s;ake,
for the &s;ake of a good Fame among the be&s;t
Men, and that he may go through the World
with an ea&s;y and comfortable Suit, let him
<HI>&s;tudy to be quiet, and to do his own Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI>
that is, not to be the common Di&s;turber of
his Neighbours, and the Aver&s;ion of his
Dealers.</P>
<P>WHO cares to deal with a Trade&s;man that
is always tormenting them with Cavils and
Quarrels, wrangling for Trifles, and going
to Law for meer Shadows of Difference, as
if he &s;ought Advantages, and quarrelled for
the &s;ake of Quarrelling?</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Cu&s;tomers will always &s;hun
trading with &s;uch a Man. No, &s;ays the
County Trade&s;man, or Chapman, what
&s;hould I deal with him for, that is always
rai&s;ing Objections, and &s;eeking Advantages?
that when he has receiv'd one hundred Pound,
will go to Law with me for eighteen Pence;
always bringing &s;ome After-Reckonings to
cavil and wrangle about, and is never pleas'd
when a Man is in his Debt, or out of his
Debt? I love, adds the good hone&s;t Shop|Keeper,
to trade where I can have hone&s;t
fair Dealing: I pay well, and I think I de|&s;erve
to be us'd well, and I will be us'd
well too, or I wont be us'd at all.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="298">
THE Trade&s;man who values his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
mu&s;t always value his Cu&s;tomers; and as he
that does &s;o, and u&s;es them with Civility,
&s;hall always keep them, and add to their
Number; &s;o he that does not, &s;hall always
lo&s;e them.</P>
<P>IT is a &s;trange Temper of Unea&s;ine&s;s that
a Man &s;hould not be able to u&s;e tho&s;e Men
well that he gets his Bread by, and keep
tho&s;e Men fa&s;t to him that he is oblig'd to
for their Cu&s;tom. As the Trade&s;man mu&s;t
be ju&s;t in all the Parts of his Corre&s;pon|dence,
&s;o he &s;hould be civil too; there is a
Courte&s;y in Trade as well as in Conver&s;a|tion,
which is due to every Body we deal
with; 'tis due in both, but much more in
Trade: Civility in Conver&s;ation is a Debt to
our&s;elves, as 'tis a Te&s;t of good Manners,
and gives a Lu&s;tre to Behaviour: But in
Trade 'tis a Debt to the Buyer; as in Money
the Borrower is Servant to the Lender, &s;o in
Trade the Seller is &s;o far Servant to the
Buyer.</P>
<P>HIS Shop is a Place to be invited into,
not to be commanded into; and therefore
we &s;ee the be&s;t Shop-Keepers
do not think
it below them to &s;tand at the Door, and with
Cap in Hand, that is, with the utmo&s;t Re|&s;pect,
to ask their Cu&s;tomers to come in, to
&s;ee if they can plea&s;e them&s;elves, and find
what they have Occa&s;ion for.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="299">
FOR a Trade&s;man to be too proud thus to
invite his Cu&s;tomer, is to be above his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
which is one of the wor&s;t Things can
be &s;aid of him; for he that is above his Bu|&s;ine&s;s
&s;hould leave it off, or el&s;e in Time he
may chance to turn the Tables, and his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s
will be above him.</P>
<P>IF then an extraordinary Civility is a Debt
in Trade, from the Seller to the Buyer, to
be &s;ure quarrelling and a litigious Wrangle
with the Buyer is a Breach of the ju&s;t Con|duct
of a Trade&s;man; it ought indeed to be
his Aver&s;ion, as certainly it will be the Buy|er's
Ave&s;&s;ion in the End: Such a Trade&s;man
&s;ells not the Parcel only, but the Cu&s;tomer,
and will in the End &s;ell his Trade too; for no
Man will deal twice with him, after he di&s;|covers
it once.</P>
<P>IT is objected here, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
a Man in a great Bu&s;ine&s;s to be without Broils
and Quarrels, and even Suits at Law &s;ome|times
in the Cour&s;e of his Trade; it will
happen, and he cannot avoid it, unle&s;s he
will always give up his Right: Sometimes
the Buyer or Cu&s;tomer, is the litigious Man;
He quarrels; the Bill of Parcel as &s;oon as
the Goods are &s;ent in, denies the Price of
Things, though agreed for, rai&s;es innumera|ble
groundle&s;s Scruples and Objections, con|trary
to Truth, and contrary to the Nature
of the Thing; and there's no dealing with
&s;uch Men; they are not to be oblig'd; they
<PB N="284" REF="300">
are not to be won by Courte&s;y or good
U&s;age, but play upon all tho&s;e Things, and
take their Advantages of them; what can a
Man do?</P>
<P>THIS is a well-grounded Objection,
if true; and in this Ca&s;e the Tables are
turn'd ju&s;t the other Way: The Buyer is then
become the Man of Strife, and the litigious
Man; the Breach of the Harmony is all
in him: And I add then, my Reproof lies
upon him, and not upon the Seller. The
Trade&s;man may err in both Extremes; he
may be a wrangling contentious Per&s;on,
which End of the Staff &s;oever he holds;
and the Reproof is to him that is guilty, not
to the other; to the Agre&s;&s;or, not the Per|&s;on
attack'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Man has bought Goods, and
the Price is agreed on, he ought to acquie&s;ce
in the Price, and not rai&s;e Cavils and Di&s;|putes
afterward, to perplex the Ca&s;e, making
a plain Bargain difficult, and di&s;puting
a ju&s;t Demand; forcing the Trade&s;man he
dealt with to go to Law for a ju&s;t Debt;
than which nothing is more &s;candalous in
Trade.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;till the &s;ame Thing; the Ad|vice
is ju&s;t and well founded; as the Seller
&s;hould avoid being litigious and contentious,
&s;o &s;hould the Buyer al&s;o; for Ju&s;tice is the
&s;ame in all.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="301">
I grant &s;ometimes in Trade, Law-Suits
and Contention are not to be avoided; and
where there is a great Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Occa&s;ions
of &s;uch Breaches often happen, &s;o that unle&s;s
the mo&s;t injurious Things in Nature are to
be born with, and unle&s;s the Defendant will
&s;uffer Depredations upon his Property, and
even allow him&s;elf to be plunder'd, he mu&s;t
defend him&s;elf, and &s;eek his Protection in
the Law.</P>
<P>BUT this has no Relation to what I am
&s;peaking of; this is not to be litigious, but to
defend a Man's Intere&s;t and Family again&s;t
the litigious quarrelling Dealer, perhaps a
Trade&s;man too; but the Character is al|ways
due to the Agre&s;&s;or; for the mo&s;t
quiet inoffen&s;ive Man in the World mu&s;t de|fend
him&s;elf if he is attack'd; Nature re|quires
it, Duty to his Family requires it, com|mon
Ju&s;tice, and indeed Nece&s;&s;ity, calls up|on
him to do it.</P>
<P>BUT this, I &s;ay, is not the Man I am
&s;peakingof: It is the Agre&s;&s;or; 'tis the Plain|tiff,
not the Defendant, that is the quarrel|ling
litigious Trade&s;man, and who ju&s;tly
comes under the Reproof of this Work.
The Difference is very plain in the Manner
of their going to Law: The quiet, hone&s;t,
inoffen&s;ive Trade&s;man may be Plaintiff, but
the querulous litigious Trade&s;man is never
Defendant. By never, I mu&s;t be under&s;tood
to mean, very rarely, very &s;eldom: He al|ways
<PB N="286" REF="302">
falls out fir&s;t, he is ea&s;y to quarrel,
loth to be reconcil'd; he does no Right,
and takes no Wrong; this is the Man that (I
&s;ay) &s;hould be deem'd a common Di&s;turber
in the Sen&s;e of the Law, and e&s;pecially in
the Sen&s;e of his Neighbours.</P>
<P>I think I need &s;ay very little to &s;et out
to the Con&s;idering Trade&s;man, the hateful
Picture of this Kind of Man, and le&s;s to
warn him from following the Example:
He is the Contempt of his Rich, and the
Aver&s;ion of his Poorer Neighbours, the
Scandal of his Trade, and the Terror of
his Cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>AND what mu&s;t we &s;ay now to the Com|pleat
Trade&s;man, with Re&s;pect to this Prac|tice?
There are &s;o many Pleas for it, &s;o ma|ny
Arguments in the Defence of it, that the
Trade&s;men &s;eem to approve of the Thing,
even where they do not follow the Example:
Nay, you have frequent Excu&s;es made for
&s;uch People by &s;ome Trade&s;men, upon a
Kind of &s;imple Policy, lea&s;t we &s;hould think
it was not allowable to a Trade&s;man to &s;ue
for his ju&s;t Debt, even where they could
not be otherwi&s;e recover'd.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uch &s;hall have an Opportunity to &s;ee
them&s;elves mi&s;taken: It is nece&s;&s;ary there|fore
to di&s;tingui&s;h a little in this Ca&s;e be|tween
the litigious quarrelling Temper I am
expo&s;ing, and the nece&s;&s;ary Recovery of our
Right.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="303">
THERE are &s;ome Men &s;o fond of going to
Law for their Debts, that they will &s;ue for
their Money by Proce&s;s, when they may
have it without; that will hardly demand a
Debt but by a Writ, and who &s;ends the At|torney
or the Bailiff to a Debtor before they
ask for the Money: The&s;e are the Men I
point at in this Di&s;cour&s;e; but as &s;ome are
thus in the Extreme one Way, &s;o &s;ome again
will pay no Body, till they are forc'd to it,
and they are in the Extreme another Way.</P>
<P>THE happy Medium between the&s;e Ex|tremes,
and which I would recommend to
the Compleat Trade&s;man, is this:
<Q><P>1. NOT to decline or delay paying a ju&s;t
Debt, if able to di&s;charge it, but to
pay it without giving any Man Cau&s;e,
or putting him to the Charge of &s;uing
for his own.</P>
<P>2. NOT to give any Man Trouble, tho' for a
ju&s;t Debt, where there is any Probabi|lity
of obtaining it without, no, nor till
all rea&s;onable, Quiet, and friendly Me|thods
are tried to avoid it.</P>
<P>3. When oblig'd by Nece&s;&s;ity to u&s;e Vio|lence,
that is to &s;ay, the Violence of a
legal Pro&s;ecution, yet to do it with Ci|vility,
with Tenderne&s;s, without ex|po&s;ing
the Debtor more than needs mu&s;t,
and above all without putting him to
more than nece&s;&s;ary Charges: This
<PB N="288" REF="304">
&s;hews a ju&s;t Reluctance to the Thing,
and te&s;tifies, that the Plantiff, (that is,
the Trade&s;man,) would not have thus
&s;ued for his Debt, if not forc'd by una|voidable
Nece&s;&s;ity; in which Ca&s;e the
Defendant is ju&s;tly an&s;werable for all
the Evils, which he &s;uffers, and which
he brings thus upon him&s;elf.</P></Q></P>
<P>As it is in Matter of Debt, that all po&s;&s;i|ble
Means &s;hould be u&s;ed to avoid coming
to Extremeties with the Debtor, &s;o in Mat|ters
of Right and Wrong, di&s;puted and con|tended,
about the hone&s;t peaceable Trade&s;man,
will, as far as in him lies, prevent a Deci&s;ion
at Law; if it be po&s;&s;ible, he will bring all
Differences to a friendly Accommodation, by
Expo&s;tulation, by Application, by Arbitra|tion,
nay, and even abating &s;ometimes much
of his Demands for Peace &s;ake.</P>
<P>WHEN two Trade&s;men of this pacifick
Temper meet, a Reference never fails to put
an End to all Di&s;putes between them: A
Man that means Hone&s;tly, is never afraid or
a&s;ham'd to refer all his Differences to the next
unbia&s;s'd and indifferent Man he meets: He
embraces all Occa&s;ions of bringing &s;uch
Things to an amicable peaceable Conclu&s;ion;
he leaves no Stone unturn'd to per&s;uade his
Oppo&s;er, to convince him he is wrong; that
he does him Inju&s;tice; that to contend at Law,
is but weakning him&s;elf, and injuring both;
<PB N="289" REF="305">
that it is but throwing away their Money,
which is the Life and Blood of their Trade;
like Princes making War for Trifles, where
both Sides are &s;ure to be Loo&s;ers, and to &s;pill
the Blood of their innocent Subjects for no|thing,
or at lea&s;t nothing comparatively.</P>
<P>IT may be po&s;&s;ible, that Both the contend|ing
Trade&s;men may be in the Right, and
both in the Wrong; that is to &s;ay, one may
be right in one Particular, and one in an|other,
while both the Particulars are Part of
the Di&s;pute. <HI>If both are peaceably inclin'd,</HI>
a grave Neighbour of a healing Di&s;po&s;ition,
&s;uch a Compleat Trade&s;man as I de&s;crib'd
in the la&s;t Chapter, who having left off Bu|&s;ine&s;s
with Reputation, and particularly with
the Reputation of a Man of Sen&s;e and Tem|per:
Such a one being call'd in, never fails
to make up the Breach, to reconcile all the
Differences, and &s;hew them how ea&s;ily they
might, with the Help of a little Moderation,
have done it without him.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, if <HI>two Trade&s;men,</HI>
who are Men of Pa&s;&s;ion, both hot, both
quarrel&s;ome, and given to Law-Suits, Men
of Contention and Strife, <HI>that is,</HI> Lovers of
it, &s;uch as I have de&s;crib'd; if tho&s;e two
meet in a Breach, 'tis like two Enemies meet|ing
in a Mine; one brings Fire, and the o|ther
Gunpowder, and both are blown up to|gether.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="306">
IN order then to prevail with the Man of
Bu&s;ine&s;s, to act upon a better View, and
with wi&s;er Mea&s;ures, we need do no more
than recommend to him the Example of the
litigious Trade&s;man, when, <HI>as we &s;ay in
other Ca&s;es,</HI> he meets with his Match: When
two &s;uch fiery hot-headed People meet toge|thes,
let him but calmly ob&s;erve, how like
two Ma&s;tiffs they worry one another; how
they wa&s;te their Sub&s;tance in the needle&s;s
Expence, rai&s;e their Spleen in the Aggrava|tions
and Provocations which they meet with
in the Proceedings; for the Rage ri&s;es with
the Expences, and the Men are like two Li|ons
in two cages, who are tearing one an|other
in Pieces in their Imagination, and are
really eager to do it, but cannot come at
one another to make u&s;e either of Teeth or
Claws.</P>
<P>THE litigious Trade&s;man who I am thus
de&s;cribing, are acting the Brutes, not the
Chri&s;tians; they pur&s;ue one another with
per&s;onal Spleen, not with a ju&s;t Demand of
Right. To &s;et this Part in a true Light, we
ought to &s;tate the Thing it &s;elf; that which
we call in our Language, <HI>Going to Law:</HI>
The &s;imple and direct Meaning is, a Man
who is injur'd by another in his Property,
<HI>that is,</HI> kept out of his Money unrea&s;ona|bly
long, or po&s;itively denied Payment of his
ju&s;t Due, or is otherwi&s;e manife&s;tly injured,
appeals to the Judge or Judges of his Coun|try
<PB N="291" REF="307">
to do him Right, to order his Oppo|nent,
and reduce him to the Nece&s;&s;ity of an|&s;wering
his Demands, according to Law.</P>
<P>THE very Nature of the Thing intimates,
that this is, in every wi&s;e Man, an Act not
of Choice, but of Nece&s;&s;ity; and that it
ought to be &s;o; that no hone&s;t Man will pro|ceed
in this Manner with another, if he can
avoid it; for who would chu&s;e to get that by
War, which he might obtain with Peace;
and I have &s;ometimes thought, that it is ma|ny
Ways be&s;t for us in this Nation, that in
Suits at Law 'tis generally found the Victor
is a Lo&s;er; that &s;o Men may &s;ee a Rea&s;on be|fore-hand,
why they &s;hould not <HI>go to Law,</HI>
if they can avoid it.</P>
<P>BUT to return: <HI>Going to Law,</HI> is an Ap|peal
of Right; as it is an Appeal to the Law,
&s;o its End mu&s;t be Peace; and this may, and
indeed ought always to be done with Temper:
When I &s;ay its End is Peace, I would be
rightly under&s;tood thus; the only ju&s;tifiable
End of going to Law, is that Right being
fir&s;t done me, I may be at Peace, may live
in Charity and good Neighbourhood, other|wi&s;e
we make the Breach in a Civil Matter
become criminal.</P>
<P>FOR Men to make a Di&s;pute at Law be
a formal Quarrel, engage their Pa&s;&s;ions in
the Difference, and turn their Trade-Breaches
into Breaches of Charity and Breaches of
T$mper: This is to put off the Chri&s;tian,
<PB N="292" REF="308">
and the Man of Sen&s;e both together; if this
were the true End and the ju&s;tifiable Prac|tice
in going to Law, &s;uch Men could not
be call'd Chri&s;tians, according to the Rules
of Chri&s;tianity; nor could they be admitted
to the Sacrament while &s;uch a Suit at Law
continued.</P>
<P>THIS Way of going to Law had a terrible
Event a few Years ago in this Nation, and
left a bloody Precedent, <HI>viz.</HI> in the late
Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and the Lord <HI>Mohun:</HI> They
had been many Years contending at Law a|bout
an E&s;tate; the Particulars are not mate|rial
here; but meeting occa&s;ionally while the
Suit was depending, the Heat of the legal
Proce&s;s broke out in an illegal Flame; they
differ in Words, give and return di&s;obliging
Expre&s;&s;ions, (to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it;) this
kindles their Pa&s;&s;ions, both hot, both brave,
and neither of them over-much Ma&s;ter of
their Temper. <HI>In a word,</HI> they quarrel, a
Challenge en&s;ues, they both meet, both fight,
and were both kill'd. I need &s;ay no more,
the Story is too well known, and was too
lately acted to be forgot.</P>
<P>THIS is the Ca&s;e in Sub&s;tance, though not
carried on to &s;uch a fatal Length, with all the
Men who go to Law upon Trifles, and carry
on their Suits at Law with Heat and Ani|mo&s;ity;
in &s;hort, they go to Law like Duke
<HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> and if they had
<PB N="293" REF="309">
Courage to engage, would put it to the like
I&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>IF the Trade&s;man &s;hould not go to Law
at all, but with evident Nece&s;&s;ity, and not
till he is &s;atisfied, he cannot obtain his Right
by any other Way, it is a Con&s;equence that
he &s;hould not proceed in it with per&s;onal
Feud and Animo&s;ity: As he &s;hould enter
upon it with Reluctance, &s;o he &s;hould go
on with it in the &s;ame Temper; always pre|&s;erving
a Willingne&s;s to be reconcil'd, and
to make an amicable End of the Di&s;pute;
always te&s;tifying that he &s;eeks nothing but his
Right, and that once granted, he has no
farther View.</P>
<P>HE that goes to Law upon any other
View, may be &s;aid not to Go to Law,
but to <HI>fight at Law;</HI> that is, he fights his
Oppo&s;er with the Weapons of the Law,
and he fights him indeed as an Enemy, to
kill and de&s;troy him, to wound, hurt, and
indeed ruin him: I need not explain it; we
have too many Examples of it among us.</P>
<P>THIS I affirm is not a lawful going to
Law: But above all, this &s;hould not be the
Trade&s;man's Way of living among his
Neighbours: It will neither gain him Cre|dit
or Comfort, nor will it advance his Trade
at all; for when once a Trade&s;man gains
the Repute of a litigious, quarrel&s;ome, &s;ple|natick
Man among his Fellow-Trade&s;men
and Dealers, no Body cares to deal with
<PB N="294" REF="310">
him, and they that do, always endeavour to
keep him at Arm's End, act with him upon
the Square, and with the utmo&s;t Caution,
as with a Man that lies upon the Catch for
all Advantages, and that will draw them
into a Snare, if he can.</P>
<P>IN a few Words then, I mu&s;t advi&s;e the
Trade&s;man to avoid the Cau&s;e, as he would
avoid the Character; avoid the Scandal of
a litigious quarrelling Temper in Bu&s;ine&s;s, as
the wor&s;t Thing that can be &s;aid of him, I
mean in Trade: Indeed, a Trade&s;man can|not
have a wor&s;e Character in the World,
except it be that of downright Cheat and
Fraud; and if he is come to that, he is out
of the Rank of tho&s;e that I am &s;peaking
to; he is no more a Compleat Trade&s;man,
but a Knave; a Trade&s;man degenerated into
a Devourer; a kind of ravenous Creature, of
the woli&s;h Kind, that watches, and lies in
wait for his Neighbours, to ruin and de|&s;troy
them.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to the great Article
of a Trade&s;man's Tenderne&s;s and Compa&s;|&s;ion
to his Debtors, who are ju&s;tly his Deb|tors,
but perhaps are not always able to an|&s;wer
his Demands, or at lea&s;t not to an&s;wer
them in their due Time, either when he ex|pects
it, or indeed when Rea&s;on demands it.</P>
<P>YET even to &s;uch the Trade&s;man under
the &s;everal Denominations, in which I have
de&s;crib'd him, will treat them with Ten|derne&s;s:
<PB N="295" REF="311">
It is true, he ought to be paid,
and the Debtor ought to &s;hew a ju&s;t Endea|vour
to pay him; for 'tis but too true, there
are &s;ome litigious Tempers, even in Debtors,
that will abu&s;e the utmo&s;t Patience, that
will delay Payment, even when they are
able to an&s;wer the Debt; in a word, that
will not pay till they are forc'd, and
that wickedly take all Advantages po&s;&s;ible
to evade the Payment of ju&s;t Debts, what|ever
Charge they are at, or whatever Charge
they put others to.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e I am not directing the Trade&s;|man
how he &s;hould act: As they &s;eem to
ask no Pity, &s;o they certainly de&s;erve none;
they are not only mi&s;chievous to them&s;elves,
but they are the Cau&s;e of much Severity to
Men of better Principles; who &s;uffer &s;ome|times
very deeply, becau&s;e they are not di&s;|tingui&s;h'd
from Men who act knavi&s;hly and
deceitfully.</P>
<P>BUT the Trade&s;man u&s;ing a ju&s;t Endea|vour
to find it out, will di&s;tingui&s;h between
them; will &s;oon &s;ee the indu&s;trious poor
Trade&s;man, who would pay punctually if
he could, and who does pay as he can, and
as fa&s;t as he is able; from the litigious De|fendant
Trade&s;man, who, though able to
pay, &s;tands out to the la&s;t again&s;t a ju&s;t Debt;
tries all po&s;&s;ible Shifts, and Tricks of the
Law, to evade, to delay, to put off; &s;uffers
Judgment by Default to protract Time, brings
<PB N="296" REF="312">
Writs of Error, to hang up the Cau&s;e, as they
call it, and at la&s;t either &s;hifts out of the
Way, and carries his Goods away, and
breaks, or otherwi&s;e makes it up as well as
he can, to the Lo&s;s of the Pro&s;ecutor as
well as him&s;elf: I &s;ay the Difference between
the&s;e two may be clearly di&s;cover'd with a
little Care and Caution, and the Trade&s;man
then will know how to govern him&s;elf.</P>
<P>FOR the poor hone&s;t Trade&s;man, he for|bears
him, takes the Money as he can pay
it, &s;hews him all the Tenderne&s;s and Com|pa&s;&s;ion
that good Temper and good Princi|ples
dictate to him; and by this Means often
gets in his Debts, which, under a ra&s;h and
rigorous Pro&s;ecution, would have been lo&s;t,
and the poor Debtor ruin'd al&s;o.</P>
<P>AND this indeed is what I mention it for:
A Trade&s;man who is in Condition to forbear
an indu&s;trious, decaying, or reduc'd Fel|low-Trade&s;man,
will find this a general
Truth, with very few Exceptions, <HI>viz.</HI> For|bearance
has &s;av'd many a poor Trade&s;man,
and been a Means to his recovering in the
World; while Cruelty and furious falling
upon a Debtor, has run down many a Trade&s;|man,
who&s;e Circum&s;tances have been other|wi&s;e
good, and has been his Ruin.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Truth with many
Trade&s;men, That Misfortunes &s;eldom come
alone; the Ca&s;e is often deriv'd from this
Original, <HI>viz.</HI> that a ra&s;h pa&s;&s;ionate Credi|tor
<PB N="297" REF="313">
not only falls upon him, but does it
with Rage, and perhaps &s;omething of Spleen,
but to be &s;ure with Pa&s;&s;ion; and expo&s;ing
him to the common Talk of the Place,
brings other Demands upon him, one in the
Neck of another, till the Man, not able to
&s;tand a Storm, though he might have &s;tood
again&s;t one Shock or two, is overwhelmed,
even before his Time.</P>
<P>IT is a terrible Article to a poor Trade&s;|man,
when he falls into the Hands of a
Creditor of this litigious quarrel&s;ome Tem|per;
he is &s;ure to find no Mercy, no good
U&s;age, no Civility from him.</P>
<P>BUT I come back to the Point: I am ad|vi&s;ing
a Trade&s;man how to govern him&s;elf
in this Part of his trading Conduct; and I
believe he will find him&s;elf advis'd for his
own Advantage.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Court no Trade-Quarrels;</HI> go to Law
with no Body, tho' for your ju&s;t Due,
if it may be obtained without it: What
rea&s;onable Man will &s;eek his Right by
violent and rough Means, that may ob|tain
it by &s;oft and &s;mooth Methods.</P>
<P>2.<HI>Try all the Methods of Gentlene&s;s and
Patience,</HI> which a forbearing Temper
can dictate, or which Prudence and the
Safety of your Debt will allow, before
you proceed to Rigour and Pro&s;ecution.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="314">
3. <HI>If you are forced</HI> to &s;uch Pro&s;ecution
of Right, as the Law directs, yet act
in it &s;o as may te&s;tify the Reluctance
of your Mind; that you are forced to
act as you do, and that nothing of
Heat and Pa&s;&s;ion has moved you to it;
but the mere ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Care
of your Intere&s;t and Family.</P>
<P>4.<HI>Proceed with all due Caution</HI> for the
Reputation of your Debtor, without
expo&s;ing him where it may be avoided,
without putting him to needle&s;s and
extravagant Expences, and, if po&s;&s;ible,
without leaving him to the Cruelty and
exacting Violence of Bailiffs and At|torneys.</P>
<P>5. In a word, <HI>be always ready</HI> to put an
End to &s;uch Pro&s;ecutions by Arbitra|tions,
where the Nature of the Thing
will allow them, and upon moderate
Terms, where they will not, rather
abating than rigorou&s;ly exacting the
utmo&s;t of your Demands.</P></Q>
<P>THIS is the Temper of the truly Chri&s;|tian
and Peaceable Trade&s;man: This will
gain him two ine&s;timable Ble&s;&s;ings, the mo&s;t
valuable in Life, namely, Peace of Mind,
and the Love and E&s;teem of all his hone&s;t
Neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION to the Second PART.</HEAD>
<P>_THE former Volume of this Work
chiefly re&s;pects the Introducti|on
of a young Trade&s;man into
his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and Dirctions for
his carrying it on, and e&s;pecially
for his per&s;onal conduct in it; the &s;ea&s;ona|ble
Advice, and the &s;ub&s;tantial In&s;tructions
<PB N="2" REF="316">
there given, are &s;uch, that if well accepted,
&s;tudied, and pur&s;ued, they will certainly lay
a firm foundation for a Trade&s;man's e&s;tabli&s;h|memt
and pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>The world has been convinc'd of the
u&s;efulne&s;s of tho&s;e In&s;tructions; they have
been received with a general approbation,
they have been made acceptable in their
manner, as they are u&s;eful in their me|thod;
and they &s;eem to be made a <HI>vade me|cum</HI>
for the ages to come, by the reception
they have met with in the age that is
pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But the readers of the fir&s;t Volume &s;eem
to ri&s;e from it with an appetite, and it has
been a kind of a general notion in their
reading, certainly the hand that has been
employ'd to give all tho&s;e kind Directions
is able to give more; and they look at me
with a kind of an expectation of &s;ome|thing
yet to come.</P>
<P>It is certain, the &s;ubject is copious, I
might &s;ay 'tis even voluminous, and there
is &s;till room for much more to be &s;aid than
has yet been po&s;&s;ible in the narrow compa&s;s
of one &s;ingle volume to be expre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Trade is an ocean, the be&s;t and mo&s;t ex|perienc'd
Sailor needs his Pilot books, his
navigating In&s;truments, his Cro&s;s-&s;taff, Qua|drant,
Compa&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to &s;teer by, and take
his ob&s;ervations, and it may with truth be
&s;aid, the Mathematicians on &s;hore make all
<PB N="3" REF="317">
the Ships &s;ail at &s;ea, for 'tis by their Rules,
their Scales, their Tables of Lines and Tan|gents,
by their Problems, and Experiments,
that the expert Seamen direct their Ships,
keep their Reckonings, and perform their
Voyages.</P>
<P>Trade, I &s;ay, is an ocean, they that &s;ail in
it, however experienc'd, have always need
of Directions; the various changes and turns
that Trade takes in the nature and con&s;e|quence
of things, and by the length of time,
are &s;uch, that the mo&s;t experienc'd Trade&s;|man
may &s;tand in need of new In&s;tructions
and Hints, and make daily di&s;coveries of
things, which he knew nothing of before.</P>
<P>How frequent is it to hear an old Trade&s;man
&s;ay, Trade is quite altered, &s;ince I knew it;
the methods are chang'd, the cour&s;e of things
is chang'd, the manner both of buying and &s;el|ling
is altered; the Manufactures are chang'd,
the very places where they are made are
chang'd, the Manufacturers remove from
town to town, and the places know them no
more; the Markets remove where they are
&s;old, and even the demands of them both
abroad and at home, the very Nations to
which they were exported in former times,
take none now; and Nations which for|merly
made no u&s;e of them, are now the
particular Staple or Market for them? As ha|bits
and the form of clothing are chang'd
by the fancies and fa&s;hions of Men, &s;o Trade
<PB N="4" REF="318">
is nece&s;&s;arily bound to follow the cu&s;toms
which the &s;ame fa&s;hions and fancies intro|duce.
The Manufactures indeed, are in kind
the &s;ame, becau&s;e the principles of all Ma|nufactures
are the &s;ame. Wool, Flax, Silk
and Hair, are the four grand principles and
foundations of Manufacture, as drugs and
plants are the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> the princi|ples
of Phy&s;ic and Pharmacy.</P>
<P>But tho' the principles are the &s;ame, the
management of the materials differ continu|ally;
invention forms the modes of wear|ing,
and art follows as invention leads. The
Manufacturing is the effect of art, the ma|terials
are the work of Nature; the fir&s;t are
variable, but the la&s;t is the &s;ame. The Silk
of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the fine Linen
of <HI>Egypt</HI> were the Manufactures and Mer|chandizes
of <HI>Tyre,</HI> as ancient as the fir&s;t
ages of Trade; and I could run out my di&s;|cour&s;e
in a u&s;eful as well as diverting di&s;|cour&s;e
upon the antiquity of Trade and Ma|nufacture,
from the va&s;t variety of the pro|duct
of the World, as far back as the Pro|phet
<HI>Ezekiel;</HI> but I &s;hall not take up your
time with things &s;o remote.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent u&s;e of it is to ob&s;erve the
various changes which Trade has &s;uffer'd;
the &s;everal turns given to the Manufactures
by the invention of Men; the violent re|movings
of the Manufactures, and the Mar|kets
of them from one City to another, and
<PB N="5" REF="319">
from one Nation to another, as Wars, the
convul&s;ions of Nations, and the fate of the
World has directed.</P>
<P>In proportion to the&s;e, tho' not equal in
degree, we &s;ee daily changes in the na|ture
of our Commerce, in the kinds of our
Manufacture among our &s;elves, in their &s;orts,
their value, the places of their making, and
of their vending; and this makes room for
new ob&s;ervations and in&s;tructions to the
Trade&s;man. He that was expert in bu&s;ine&s;s
forty year ago, let him lay by, and be out
of Trade but twenty year, will have need al|mo&s;t
to &s;erve a new Apprentice&s;hip, and
learn new skill and judgment in the Goods
he formerly dealt in; and in a word, will
want ju&s;t to begin where he begun be|fore.</P>
<P>And
yet the materials are &s;till the &s;ame,
the Silks of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> are tran&s;ported to <HI>Italy,</HI>
to <HI>France</HI> and to <HI>Spittlefields;</HI> the raw Silk
is remov'd, I mean the very growth of it,
from the banks of the <HI>Ca&s;pian,</HI> to the banks
of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; and from the
&s;hores of <HI>Georgia</HI> to the &s;hores of <HI>Italy;</HI>
and the Manufactures of <HI>A&s;ia</HI> are infinitely
out done in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The fine Linen of <HI>Egypt</HI> is remov'd to
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the dyeing of
Purple and Scarlet, for which the <HI>Phoenici|ans</HI>
were &s;o fam'd, is lo&s;t to that part of
<PB N="6" REF="320">
the World, and &s;et up in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol|land.</HI></P>
<P>To
bring this home, we find &s;everal bran|ches
of our Manufactures in <HI>England</HI> chang'd,
and &s;ome of them remov'd; the kinds of
them alter'd, the demand for them chang'd,
and that within our own memory, as &s;hall
be at large &s;hew'd in its place.</P>
<P>By this means, and for this rea&s;on, the
Trade is chang'd, the face of it is chang'd,
and the place of it; for the Trade follows
the demand, as the Cart follows the Hor&s;e
that draws it.</P>
<P>This variety gives, as I have &s;aid, a new
face to things, and the Manufacturer has
daily new rules to learn, new cu&s;toms to &s;et
up, and new mea&s;ures to take, &s;uch as his
Fore-fathers never knew, and &s;o it will be
to the end of time.</P>
<P>It is become a policy in Trade, to alter
Fa&s;hions and Cu&s;toms; not only in Cloths,
that part was always variable, at lea&s;t in the&s;e
parts of the World; but it never went &s;uch
a length in other things as it does now:
For the Fa&s;hions alter now in the more
durable kinds of things, &s;uch as Furni|ture
of Hou&s;es, Equipages, Coaches, nay even
of Hou&s;es them&s;elves; and Hou&s;es built
twenty or thirty years ago, are now old fa|&s;hion'd,
and mu&s;t be pull'd down, to build
more modi&s;h Apartments; and we &s;ee more
new Hou&s;es at this time in <HI>England,</HI> built
<PB N="7" REF="321">
within twenty to thirty years, than were
built in <HI>England</HI> in two hundred years be|fore.</P>
<P>This
mu&s;t needs give a new turn to the
Trade, and that of cour&s;e gives new methods
and new mea&s;ures to the Manufacturers,
obliges them to a continual &s;tudy of novel|ty,
and to rack their invention for new Fa|&s;hions,
introduces new Cu&s;toms, and even
gives a turn to Trade it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon this foundation it becomes nece&s;|&s;ary,
to an <HI>Engli&s;h Trade&s;man,</HI> to give him a
&s;tate of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade, an account of its
pre&s;ent, not its pa&s;t &s;ituation; and to let him
&s;ee, not what it has been, but what it is, and
not what a <HI>Trade&s;man</HI> was to do forty years a|go,
but what he is to do now, in order to carry
on his bu&s;ine&s;s pro&s;perou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>Nor has the &s;tate and nature of Trade on|ly
&s;uffer'd a change; but the <HI>Trade&s;men</HI>
them&s;elves are fallen into more extravagan|cies,
and make new kinds of excur&s;ions
out of their bu&s;ine&s;s, run new hazards and
dangers, and are ruin'd by new and differ|ent
ways than they did, or indeed than they
could formerly.</P>
<P>In the good old days of Trade, which
our Fore-fathers plodded on in, and got
E&s;tates too at, there were no Bubbles, no
Stock-jobbing, no South-&s;ea Infatuations,
no Lotteries, no Funds, no Annuities, no
buying of Navy Bills, and publick Securi|ties,
<PB N="8" REF="322">
no circulating Exchequer Bills; in a
word, Trade was a va&s;t great River, and all
the Money in the Kingdom ran down its
mighty &s;tream; the whole wealth of the Na|tion
kept in its Channel, and there were
no new Canals or Side-drains laid open to
abate its waters, to divert its current, and
to carry its &s;tream off from the ordinary
cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Whereas now half your Trading Ma|nufacturers
are Stock-jobbers, and half the
&s;tock of the Nation is diverted from the
channel of Trade to run wa&s;te, as I may
&s;ay, and like a River without banks, to
drown the flat country, and &s;poil the in|du&s;try
of the Plough and the Husbandman.
Or like a river which u&s;ed to drive many
Mills, when the Water is by new Drains
drawn off, and the Stream diverted, they have
&s;carce Water enough left in the ordinary
Channel to keep the Mills ju&s;t jogging on,
not in full work, and &s;ometimes, nay too
often, they &s;tand &s;till for want of Water;
whereas &s;ometimes they have been known
to be in danger of blowing up by a too great
weight upon them.</P>
<P>In a word, and to leave allegories, Trade
is limited and &s;traightn'd in abundance of ar|ticles,
by the diverting &s;o va&s;t a &s;tock of ready
Money from it, as our Stocks, and Banks,
and Funds carry out of that ordinary cour&s;e;
and by the reducing Paper Credit to a much
<PB N="9" REF="323">
narrower compa&s;s than it was formerly at,
and by &s;everal other things which are acci|dents
to Trade particular to the&s;e times, and
which Trade&s;men were never acquainted
with before.</P>
<P>For this rea&s;on a new &s;tate of Commerce,
and new In&s;tructions to Trading Manufa|cturers,
for their carrying on their Trades,
and for the management of them&s;elves, af|ter
the new methods of Trade, is very &s;uita|ble
to the&s;e times; and mu&s;t be u&s;eful to our
Trading Manufacturers, and this is the far|ther
de&s;ign of this Work.</P>
<P>Previous to this undertaking, and preli|minary
to this part of it, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to
mention, that I am &s;till confining my &s;elf
in this work to our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade; that is
to &s;ay, the home Trade, and home Traders,
including a little of our &s;hipping and &s;ailing;
&s;o far only as it relates to our inland river na|vigation,
and the coa&s;ting Trade, which be|longs
to, and is wholly cairried on within our
&s;elves; not at all concerning our &s;elves with
the Merchant or the Merchandizing part of
our Trade, how great &s;oever it is, and how|ever
well worth con&s;idering; nay, the
greater and more worth con&s;idering that
part may be, the more I &s;hall avoid med|ling
with it here, referring it to be talk'd
of in its proper place, well meriting to be
&s;poken of apart, and unincumbred with
any other di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="324">
It is no boa&s;t, nor any peculiarity or par|tiality
to our &s;elves to &s;ay, that <HI>England</HI>
is at this time not only a Nation of the
greate&s;t Trade in the World, but is the cen|ter
of the whole Commerce of <HI>Europe</HI> at
lea&s;t, if not the whole trading World.
I prove it by the&s;e two heads.</P>
<Q><P>I. It exports more value of its own pro|duce,
and of the labour of its own peo|ple,
than any other Nation.</P>
<P>II. It con&s;umes more of the Growth and
Produce, Labour and Manufacture of
foreign Countries, than any other Na|tion.</P></Q>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;hews the value and excellence
of its Produce, and of its Manufactures, and
the demand for them in other Countries.</P>
<P>And the &s;econd proves the dependance
foreign Nations have upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Trade, for the con&s;umption of their Goods,
and without which they would not know
how to vent or di&s;po&s;e of them.</P>
<P>And to bring it to the point in debate,
both the&s;e &s;hew the greatne&s;s and prodigi|ous
extent of our home Trade, which with|out
partiality is certainly beyond any other
Nation in <HI>Europe;</HI> and including <HI>Scotland</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which yet are not con&s;iderable
in proportion to the re&s;t, greater than all
<PB N="11" REF="325">
the re&s;t of the inland Commerce of <HI>Europe.</HI>
As to our Plantations or Colonies, they are
naturally to be included, their people being
our own, and their con&s;umption always to
be reckon'd as part of our own, their Pro|duce
our Produce, and their Wealth our
Wealth; and &s;o it is, in all ca&s;es co&s;ider'd,
I &s;ay our Trade &s;o con&s;ider'd, is I believe
greater than all the inland Trade of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It may be worth while, but to take a &s;hort
view here of our importation of Goods of
foreign growth from abroad, which Goods,
<HI>for &s;uch I &s;hall only mention,</HI> are chiefly
made u&s;e of, and con&s;umed at home, as for
&s;uch as are exported again to other Coun|tries,
I take little notice of them.</P>
<P>The Wines and Brandy imported from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> when our Trade was open
with <HI>France,</HI> was &s;o great, that 'tis hardly cre|dible;
according to an account given in
from the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, they amounted as
follows.</P>
<P>Wine 22372 ton.</P>
<P>Brandy 11291 ton.</P>
<P>That Trade being &s;ince check'd by prohi|bitions,
and high duties, the brandy is
indeed brought in by &s;muggling and clan|de&s;tine
Trade, &s;o that no e&s;timate can be
made of it; and the channel of the wine
Trade being turn'd, we imported in the
year 1621. into the port of <HI>London</HI> only,
as follows,

All the&s;e wines are con&s;um'd at home,
be&s;ides the &s;everal quantities imported in
the out-ports of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and

an ordinary computation thus.</P>
<P>The importation in the out-ports of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> and including <HI>Ireland,</HI> e&s;ti|mated
at one third of the quantity import|ed
at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The importation of wine in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in|cluding
<HI>French,</HI> and inclu&s;ive of the wines
run on &s;hore there, and at the I&s;le of <HI>Man,</HI>
are indeed too low in this calculation by
a great deal.</P>
<P>The importation of brandy has been nine
thou&s;and ton a year, &s;uppo&s;e it now at
one half, &s;o that by e&s;timation, the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI>
Dominions import yearly from <HI>France, Spain,

yearly carried to our <HI>We&s;t India</HI> Colonies,
which, one year with another, amounts to
above a thou&s;and pipes a year.</P>
<P>2. The Silk in bales, raw and thrown &s;ilk
including, the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> a|mounts

<P>The value of this at but 100<HI>l.</HI> per bale, one

<P>3. Add to this, that the fruit properly call'd
&s;o, (<HI>viz.</HI>) rai&s;ins, figs, almonds, oranges, le|mons,

<P>This is a copious &s;ubject indeed; nor is it
ea&s;y to give a De&s;cription of it in the nar|row
compa&s;s to which I am pre&s;crib'd; It
would rather call for a large Volume in
Folio, however, I mu&s;t do it in little as
well as I can.</P>
<P>Tho' the Trading Manufacturer is de&s;crib'd
in the clo&s;e of our fir&s;t part, to be only
&s;uch as are concern'd in the home Trade;
that is to &s;ay, in buying and &s;elling among
our &s;elves, exclu&s;ive of all that part, which
we call foreign corre&s;pondence; yet the
home Trade is not confin'd to the Goods
only made at home, or to the Goods only
con&s;um'd at home. But the Trading Ma|nufacturer
I am &s;peaking of, is employ'd in
buying and &s;elling, as well the Manufactures
made at home, and the Growth of the
Country at home, which are exported into
foreign Countries, and are bought by the
<PB N="23" REF="337">
Merchants for that purpo&s;e; as al&s;o in buy|ing
and &s;elling the Goods, which are the
Growth and Manufacture of foreign Coun|tries;
and are imported here by the Mer|chants,
but are con&s;um'd at home, or made
u&s;e of at home, tho' it be for the fitting
other Goods for exportation.</P>
<P>Al&s;o many of the Goods imported from
abroad, and which are of the Growth and
Produce of the Country, from whence they
come, or the Manufacture of the people
of tho&s;e Countries, are bought by our
Trade&s;men of tho&s;e Merchants, which
imported them, and &s;old again Nett as they
come, to other Merchants who export them
again to other Countries; &s;o that tho' they
are exported again, yet pa&s;&s;ing thus thro'
the hands of &s;ome of our Trading Manufac|turers,
they become on that account a
branch of our home Commerce, and are a
part of the general circulation of Trade
mention'd before. <HI>For example,</HI>
<Q><P>Dye &s;tuffs and drugs of &s;everal &s;orts, as
I mention'd in the ca&s;e of carriage, are
foreign Goods; and are bought of the
Merchants by the Dry-&s;alter, who is an
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trading Shopkeeper; and the&s;e
are &s;old again by the &s;aid Salter to other
Merchants to be exported again; and &s;o
far as they pa&s;s thro' the hands of the
<PB N="24" REF="338">
&s;aid Salter, they become an article of our
home Trade for the time only; &s;uch are
our Salt-peter, Indico, Shumach, Gauls,
Logwood, Fu&s;tick, Bra&s;ileto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the&s;e
lo&s;e al&s;o their Appearance, &s;uffering the
operation of grinding in a Mill, which
&s;ometimes cau&s;es them to be bought and
&s;old &s;everal times before they come to be
exported.</P>
<P>Callicoe's, <HI>India</HI> Silks, Cotton, Wool,
Coffee, Tea, Pepper, and in general, al|mo&s;t
all the &s;orts of Goods imported from
the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> are thus bought and &s;old;
fir&s;t from the Company, and &s;econdly to
the Merchants, for the &s;aid Exportation;
and &s;o they become an article of our
home Trade in the &s;ame manner; and
&s;o of the re&s;t.</P></Q></P>
<P>But with this &s;hort exception for the
buying and &s;hipping off foreign Goods;
which in the language of the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e
is call'd exporting by Certificate; they have
al&s;o another, <HI>viz.</HI> that they only pa&s;s thro'
a few hands; the re&s;t of our Trade,
which may properly, and in a more li|mited
re&s;train'd &s;en&s;e be call'd our home
Trade, con&s;i&s;ts in buying and &s;elling &s;uch
Goods of any kind, and of all kind what|&s;oever,
as are con&s;um'd at home; whether
manufactured at home or no, and whether
of our own Growth or no; as well what is im|ported
for our u&s;e from abroad, as what
<PB N="25" REF="339">
is exported for other Countries of the Growth
or Manufacture of our Country, and Peo|ple
at home; this I take to be a &s;hort, and yet
full account, of the Fund at lea&s;t, of our
home Trade, and of what our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Trade&s;men are employ'd in and about.</P>
<P>The various manner, how the&s;e Goods
of &s;o many &s;orts and kinds are brought to|gether,
and brought to the &s;everal Markets
where they are &s;old; the manner in which
they pa&s;s from hand to hand, and from
place to place, which I call the circulation
of Trade, and the prodigious numbers of
People, which are by this means employ'd,
more than otherwi&s;e would be, are the con|&s;equences
of that circulation, and which
are all articles by them&s;elves, &s;erving to add
to the great ma&s;s of Bu&s;ine&s;s call'd the <HI>En|li&s;h</HI>
home Trade.</P>
<P>Nor can I exclude that prodigy of Bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
which tho' it is neither buying or &s;el|ling,
making or manufacturing, planting or
reaping, yet is to be reckon'd a part of
Trade; and the People principally manag|ing
it, are ju&s;tly al&s;o call'd Trade&s;men; I
mean the article of carriage, by Land and
by Sea, mention'd in my Introduction, but
promis'd there to be &s;poken to more at
large.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> By this article of carriage, which
I thus call a branch of Trade, I do
<PB N="26" REF="340">
not mean the Farmer's carrying his
corn from the Field to his Barn, or
from his Barn to the Market; nor the
Manufacturer carrying his wool to the
Spinner's, or his yarn from the Spin|ner's
back to his own hou&s;e; the Ba|ker's
carrying about his bread, or the
Butcher and Farmer his provi&s;ions to
Market; no, tho' the&s;e are for &s;ale;
nor do I reckon up an innumerable
number of &s;maller things carried from
place to place, &s;uch as Materials for
building and repairing, chalk, and lime,
and dung, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for manuring of Land,
and the like.</Q>
<P>But by this great article of carriage, I am
to be under&s;tood, to mean carriage for
Trade; in the capital articles of River and
Coa&s;t Navigation, whether of corn or any
other Goods; and the carriage of &s;hopkeep|ers
Goods, Manufactures and Materials
for Manufacturers, which are carry'd by &s;tat|ed
and u&s;ual Carriers for hire, and for the
particular a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Trade, either by
Cart, Waggon, or Hor&s;epacks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If ju&s;t calculations were made of the im|men&s;e
&s;ums of Money paid yearly in <HI>En|gland</HI>
upon this one occa&s;ion, the numbers
of people, of cattle, and of &s;hips which it
con&s;tantly employs, tho' no calculation could
be made from it, of the value of the Goods
<PB N="27" REF="341">
carried, e&s;pecially by land carriage; yet it
might form &s;ome <HI>Ideas</HI> in the mind of the
reader, how prodigious a thing the Com|merce
it &s;elf is; and of what importance
the people are con&s;equently who carry it
on.</P>
<P>It is true, the carriage of &s;ome heavy
Goods, and in their often removes from
place to place, as well as from hand to hand,
before they come to the la&s;t con&s;umer, a|mounts
&s;everal times over the value of
the fir&s;t co&s;t; and &s;everal examples might
be given of this; as particularly that of
coals, &s;alt, fi&s;h, tobacco, chalk, potters
and pipe-clay, and &s;everal other Goods of
the like &s;orts, which are bulky or heavy,
and are brought either by Sea or by Land|carriage
a great way.</P>
<P>How the coals in &s;everal parts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
where they are carried twenty to thir|ty
miles and more, by waggons and hor&s;e|carriage,
are bought for 2 <HI>s.</HI> or 4 <HI>s.</HI> per
Chaldron at the Pit, and are worth from
five to ten times that &s;um at the con|&s;umer's,
merely by the expence of carriage,
I have mention'd already; it mu&s;t be add|ed,
that where they pay no tax, for the
Tax upon coals is only plac'd upon &s;uch
coals as are carried by Sea, the River
carried coals paying no part of it, though
in &s;ome places carried over large arms or
Bays of the Sea: thus in the ca&s;e of the coals
<PB N="28" REF="342">
brought from the we&s;t part of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI>
from <HI>Wake&s;ield,</HI> down the River <HI>Calder;</HI>
the&s;e coals are carry'd by Water to <HI>Selby;</HI>
and then they enter the open Sea, or arm
of the Sea, which we call the <HI>Humber;</HI> the
<HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Calder,</HI> tho' join'd, lo&s;ing their
names. Thus they pa&s;s the &s;aid <HI>Hum|ber,</HI>
where it is &s;everal miles broad, and
then enter the <HI>Ou&s;e,</HI> and go up by the tide
to the City of <HI>York,</HI> and yet pay no duty;
the&s;e coals are bought at the Pit for at mo&s;t
1 <HI>d.</HI> to 1 1/2. per Bu&s;hel, and yet at <HI>York,</HI> tho'
carried all the way by Water, are &s;old for
7 <HI>d.</HI> to 8 <HI>d.</HI> per Bu&s;hel at cheape&s;t; and much
more &s;ometimes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI>-coals brought by Sea to
<HI>London,</HI> are bought at the Pit, or at the Steath,
which is the Wharf, for under 5 <HI>s.</HI> per Chal|dron;
I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;peak with the mo&s;t; but
when they come to <HI>London,</HI> are not deliver'd
to the con&s;umcrs under from 25 to 30 <HI>s.</HI> per
Chaldron; and when they are a third time
loaded on board the Lighters in the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and carried thro' bridge, then loaded a fourth
time into the great we&s;t-country Barges, and
carry'd up the River, perhaps to <HI>Oxford,</HI> or
<HI>Abbington,</HI> and thence loaded a fifth time in
carts or waggons, and carried perhaps ten or
fifteen or twenty miles, to the la&s;t con&s;umer;
by this time they are &s;ometimes &s;old for 45 to
50 <HI>s.</HI> per Chaldron; &s;o that the 5 <HI>s.</HI> fir&s;t co&s;t
including 5 <HI>s.</HI> tax is encrea&s;ed to five times
<PB N="29" REF="343">
the prime co&s;t; and becau&s;e I have menti|on'd
the frequent loading and unloading the
coals, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to explain it here once
for all, becau&s;e it may give a light into the
nature of this River and Coa&s;t Commerce,
not in this thing only, but in many others.
The&s;e loadings are thus.</P>
<P>1. They are dug in the Pit a va&s;t depth
in the Ground, &s;ometimes fifty, &s;ixty, to a
hundred &s;athom, and being loaded, for &s;o
the Miners call it, into a great basket or Tub,
are drawn up by a wheel and hor&s;e, or hor|&s;es,
(to the day that is to the light) to the top
of the &s;ha&s;t or pit mouth, and there thrown
out upon the great heap to lye ready again&s;t
the Ships come into the Port to demand them.</P>
<P>2. They are then loaded again into a
great machine call'd a Waggon, which by
the means of an artificial road call'd a <HI>Wag|gon-way,</HI>
goes with the help of but one
hor&s;e, and carries two Chaldron or more
at a time; and this &s;ometimes three or four
miles to the neare&s;t River or Water-carriage
they come at, and there they are either
thrown into or from a great &s;tore-hou&s;e call'd
a <HI>Stethe,</HI> made &s;o artificially, with one part
clo&s;e to or hanging over the Water, that
the <HI>Lighters</HI> or <HI>Keels</HI> can come clo&s;e to
or under it, and the coals be at once &s;hot
out of the Waggon into the &s;aid Lighters,
which carry them to the Ships; which I
call the fir&s;t loading upon the Water.</P>
<Q><PB N="30" REF="344">
<P>From the Lighters they are thrown by
hand into the Ships, which is the &s;e|cond
loading.</P>
<P>From the Ships being brought to <HI>London,</HI>
they are deliver'd by the <HI>Coal-Meeters</HI>
into Coal-lighters or Ve&s;&s;els in the River,
which is the third loading.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e Lighters into the great We&s;t|country
Barges, &s;uppo&s;e for <HI>Oxford</HI> or
<HI>Abbington,</HI> which is the fourth load|ing.</P>
<P>From tho&s;e Barges they are loaded into
Carts and Waggons, to be carried to
the re&s;pective Country Towns to the
la&s;t con&s;umer, which is the fifth load|ing.</P></Q>
<P>But if you include the account of their digging
and loading into the Waggons, this makes
&s;even &s;everal removes, all which adds to the
expences, and heightens the price of Coals to
&s;uch a degree, as is mention'd above.</P>
<P>It is the like in &s;everal other Goods, too
many to repeat; &s;uch as Salt, Lead, Stone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> As the workman&s;hip adds to the
value of Manufactures, &s;o the carriage to
that of heavy Goods; thus the Tobacco from
<HI>Virginia</HI> is bought thence at 1 <HI>d.</HI> per pound,
and yet by the freight, the lading fir&s;t by Sloops
there, then unlading by Lighters here, and
Carts after, to what a rate does it rai&s;e the
Goods! not to mention the duties to the
Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="345">
But from the&s;e bulky heavy articles, let
us come to that which is more particular|ly
a branch of the great Commerce I am
&s;peaking of, namely the carriage of Trade&s;|mens
Goods from place to place, for &s;ale.</P>
<P>This article would &s;eem very incredible
were it not to be demon&s;trated; the num|bers
of carriers by waggon and by pack|hor&s;es,
who are con&s;tantly going and com|ing,
between this great City of <HI>London,</HI>
and almo&s;t all the Towns of note in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
from beyond <HI>Exeter</HI> 160 miles South|we&s;t,
to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> 300 to 340 miles North;
and from <HI>We&s;t-Che&s;ter</HI> 150 miles North|we&s;t,
to <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI> 100 miles
Ea&s;t.</P>
<P>The number of ve&s;&s;els, hor&s;es and peo|ple
employ'd in this carriage is incredible,
and the Money annually paid for this car|riage
is &s;o al&s;o; let &s;ome few articles explain
it in general.</P>
<P>It is computed by Authors of good Cre|dit,
that the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> &s;ends up
to <HI>London</HI> yearly, and to <HI>Sturbridge-Fair</HI>
19000 ton of Chee&s;e.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> and its adjacent
Lands, near 30000 ton of Chee&s;e to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and all other places.</P>
<P>The Counties of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> including <HI>Cam|bridge&s;hire</HI>
and a &s;mall quantity from <HI>York,</HI>
fifty thou&s;and firkins of Butter, each firkin
weighs 56 pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="346">
The quantity of Corn con&s;um'd in the
City of <HI>London</HI> and parts adjacent is &s;o great,
and the way of its being brought thither
&s;o different, as &s;hall be &s;hewn in its
place, that no calculation can be made of
it, &s;o I &s;hall not attempt it: 'Tis our great
&s;elicity in <HI>England,</HI> that how great and
grievous &s;oever the Taxes have been, we
are not yet come to a <HI>Gabelle</HI> or tax up|on
Corn, as is the ca&s;e of <HI>Italy,</HI> and many
other Countries, and may in time be our
ca&s;e, if Wars and publick Perplexities en|crea&s;e
upon us. Were that our ca&s;e, we had
been able exactly to calculate the quantity
of Corn brought to this great Market, and
to all the re&s;t of the great Corn Markets
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But it may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent to ob&s;erve,
that be&s;ides the prodigious quantity of Corn,
and Meal, and Malt, brought by Sea, and
by the navigation of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and other
Rivers; &s;uch as the <HI>Medway,</HI> the <HI>Lea,</HI> and
&s;everal &s;maller Rivers to <HI>London,</HI> the like of
which is not to be &s;een in the World; there
is al&s;o a very great quantity, e&s;pecially of
Meal and Malt, brought by Land-carriage,
from the Counties of <HI>Surrey, Kent, Su&s;&s;ex,</HI>
and <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> for the Wheat is carry'd by
Land even from beyond <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> to <HI>Farn|ham</HI>
Market, and from thence to the Mills a|bout
<HI>Guildford,</HI> and all the Country adjoin|ing,
and then to <HI>London</HI> by Water.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="347">
In like manner Wheat is brought from
<HI>Northampton&s;hire,</HI> nay from <HI>Harbro$</HI> in <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI>
and from <HI>Bedford,</HI> to the great
Markets of <HI>Hemp&s;tead,</HI> S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and <HI>Hitch|in,</HI>
and being then ground at innumerable
Mills (in the County of <HI>Hertford</HI> chiefly,
which is full of Mills,) is brought by Land-carriage
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This va&s;t carriage of Corn and Meal to
<HI>London,</HI> is a branch of Trade, and is to be
reckon'd as &s;uch, otherwi&s;e I &s;hould not men|tion
it, having hinted, that I do not rec|kon
the carriage of Corn to Market, as
an ordinary part of Trade: But this ar|ticle
is a part of the great Carriage I am
&s;peaking of, and 'tis ob&s;ervable, that there
are many Farmers, and others that are not
Farmers, who keep Teams of Hor&s;es on pur|po&s;e
to let them out, for the bringing of
Corn, and Meal, and Malt to <HI>London;</HI> and
generally the&s;e Carriages go back laden
with Coals, Grocery, Wine, Salt, Oil,
Iron, Chee&s;e, and other heavy Goods for
Shop-Keepers and Trade&s;men of the
Country, and it is a very great return they
make for the mere expence of this Car|riage.</P>
<P>Here
I might branch out this di&s;cour&s;e very
profitably, and very much for the benefit of
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;man, in giving an account
of the Corn-Trade, the Butter and Chee&s;e-Trade,
and the Malting-Trade; three arti|cles
<PB N="34" REF="348">
which employ &s;o much of the Lands
of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;uch an innumerable num|ber
of our People and Cattle, that they are,
and I believe ju&s;tly &s;o e&s;teem'd, a quarter
part of the whole inland Commerce: But
this wou'd be a task &s;o difficult, is a &s;ubject
&s;o nice, &s;o full of variety, and of u&s;eful
In&s;truction to the Trade&s;men, as well as
to the landed Men, that unle&s;s I wou'd
handle it very &s;uperficially, which I de|&s;ire
not to be guilty of in any thing I
&s;hall &s;peak of in this Work, it wou'd be
the greate&s;t folly imaginable to meddle with
it.</P>
<P>The parts of it are &s;o many, the Chan|nels
it runs in &s;o differing and di&s;tant from
one another, and the People are employ'd
in it in &s;o differing a manner, that it wou'd
take up a large Volume by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t &s;uffice to &s;ay, that <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Scotland,</HI> which are now prodigiou&s;ly en|creas'd
in the Product of Corn, and every
day more and more encrea&s;ing, do &s;upply
a very great part of the Trading Countries,
I mean on the South and We&s;t Shores of
<HI>Europe,</HI> with Corn, whenever their Crops
fail, or that by Scarcity or War, or any o|ther
means, the price in tho&s;e Countries
makes it worth while to carry it to them.</P>
<P>It is very &s;eldom but in &s;ome parts or
other the Harve&s;t fails, differing Climates
and differing Soils make frequent deficiencies
<PB N="35" REF="349">
in Corn, drought &s;tarves them in <HI>Spain,</HI> Lo|cu&s;ts
devour 'em in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and on the coa&s;t of
<HI>Barbary;</HI> exce&s;&s;ive Rains hurt 'em in <HI>France,</HI>
and e&s;pecially Hail; and the like in <HI>Germany;</HI>
and as to <HI>Holland,</HI> their doors are always
open to receive Corn, having little, very lit|tle
of their own; not enough, as a good
Author writing on that &s;ubject expre&s;&s;es it,
to feed their Cocks and Hens. Some or
other of the&s;e Markets &s;eldom fail, and
<HI>England</HI> lying open by Sea to them all, 'tis
very &s;eldom but we have a vent abroad.</P>
<P>If it happens otherwi&s;e, if plenty and a
good Harve&s;t ble&s;&s;es all the Countries I &s;peak
of, and they call for no Corn for <HI>France,
Spain, Portugal,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> that Ble&s;&s;ing which
makes the World &s;mile, makes us mourn;
'tis a bad article for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that we
are, as it may be &s;aid, curs'd with Plenty.
In a word, our Product being more than
our con&s;umption, and the Corn not find|ing
a vent, the Farmer is ruin'd, the Land|lord
can't be paid his Rent, the Lands can|not
be till'd, &s;o the poor are not employ'd;
a &s;trange Paradox! the People &s;tarve by
having too much Bread.</P>
<P>As the Corn-Trade is o&s; &s;uch con&s;equence
to us, for the Shipping off the overplus, &s;o
it is a very con&s;iderable Bu&s;ine&s;s in it &s;elf;
the principal People concern'd in it, as a
Trade, are, tho' very numerous indeed, yet
but of four Denominations.</P>

<P>The&s;e
Corn-Factors in the Country ride
about among the Farmers, and buy the
Corn, even in the Barn before it is thre&s;h'd,
nay, &s;ometimes they buy it in the Field
&s;tanding, not only before it is reap'd,
but before it is ripe. This &s;ubtle bu&s;ine&s;s

which they, poor Men, often want, they buy
cheap when there is a pro&s;pect of Corn be|ing

who, as I &s;aid, (<HI>Chap. II.</HI>) ought not to be
<PB N="37" REF="351">
fools, and indeed they &s;eldom are &s;o; and
were they fam'd for their hone&s;ty, as much
as they generally are for their under&s;tanding
in bu&s;ine&s;s, they might boa&s;t of having
a very &s;hining character.</P>
<P>II. Meal-Men; the&s;e generally live either
in <HI>London,</HI> or within thirty Miles of it,
that employment chiefly relating to the Mar|kets
of <HI>London;</HI> they formerly were the
general buyers of Corn, that is to &s;ay,
Wheat and Rye, in all the great Markets
about <HI>London,</HI> or within thirty or forty
Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which Corn they u&s;ed
to bring to the neare&s;t Mills they could find
to the Market, and there have it ground,
and then &s;ell the Meal to the Shopkeepers,
called Meal-men in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But a few Years pa&s;t has given a new
turn to this Trade; for now the Bakers in
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent, go to the
Markets them&s;elves, and have cut out the
Shopkeeping Meal-men; &s;o the Bakers are
the Meal-men, and &s;ell the fine Flower to
private Families, as the Meal-men u&s;ed to do;
and as the Bakers have cut out the Meal-&s;hops
in <HI>London,</HI> &s;o the Millers have cut
out the Mealmen in the Country; and
whereas they formerly only ground the
Corn for the Meal-men, they now &s;corn
that Trade, buy the Corn, and grind it for
them&s;elves; &s;o the Baker goes to the Mil|ler
<PB N="38" REF="352">
for his Meal, and the Miller goes to
the Market for the Corn.</P>
<P>It is true, this is an anticipation in Trade,
and is again&s;t that &s;tated whole&s;ome rule
of Commerce, which I mention'd before,
<HI>viz.</HI> That Trade ought to pa&s;s thro' as
many hands as it can, and that the cir|culation
of Trade, like that of the
Blood, is the life of the Commerce. But
I am not directing to what &s;hou'd be, but
telling what is; 'tis certain, the Meal-men
are in a manner cut out of the Trade, both
in <HI>London</HI> and in the Country too, except
it be tho&s;e Country Meal-men who &s;end
Meal to <HI>London</HI> by Barges, from all the
Countries bordering on the <HI>Thames,</HI> or on
any navigable River running into the
<HI>Thames,</HI> We&s;t, and &s;ome about <HI>Chiche&s;ter,
Arundel,</HI> and the coa&s;t of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Hamp|&s;hire,</HI>
who &s;end Meal by Sea; and the&s;e are
a kind of Meal-Merchants, and have Fac|tors
at <HI>London</HI> to &s;ell it for them, either
at <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> the great Meal-Market of
<HI>England,</HI> or at other &s;maller Markets.</P>
<P>By this change of the Trade, the Mil|lers,
e&s;pecially in that part of <HI>England</HI> which
is near the <HI>Thames</HI> who in former times were
e&s;eem'd People of a very mean Employ|ment,
are now become Men of va&s;t Bu&s;i|ne&s;s;
and it is not an uncommon thing to
have Mills upon &s;ome of the large Rivers
<PB N="39" REF="353">
near the Town, which are let for three or
four hundred pounds a year rent.</P>
<P>III. Mal&s;ters; the&s;e are now no longer
Farmers, and as might be &s;aid, working
labouring People, as was formerly the ca&s;e,
when the public expence of Beer and Ale,
and the number of Alc-hou&s;es was not &s;o
great, but generally the mail con&s;iderable
Farmers malted their own Barley, e&s;pecial|ly
in the Towns and Countries; and from
whence they &s;upplied <HI>London,</HI> and almo&s;t
every farm hou&s;e of note.</P>
<P>As the demand for Malt encreas'd, tho&s;e
Farmers found it for their purpo&s;e to make
more and larger quantities of Malt, than
the Barley they them&s;elves &s;owed wou'd &s;up|ply,
and &s;o bought the Barley at the &s;mal|ler
Farms about them; till at length the
Market for Malt &s;till encrea&s;ing, and the
profits likewi&s;e encouraging, they &s;ought far
and near for Barley; and at this time the
Malting Trade at <HI>Ware, Hartford, Roy&s;ton,
Hitchin,</HI> and other Towns on that &s;ide
of <HI>Hertford&s;hire,</HI> fetch their Barley twenty,
thirty, or forty Miles, and all the Barley they
can get out of the Counties of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Cam|bridge,
Bedford, Huntingdon,</HI> and even as far
as <HI>Suffolk,</HI> is little enough to &s;upply them;
and the like it is at all the Malt-making
Towns upon the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> where
the Malt-Trade is carried on for &s;upply of
<PB N="40" REF="354">
<HI>London,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>King&s;ton, Chert&s;ey, Wind&s;or,
High-Wickham, Reading, Wallingford, Ab|bington,
Tame, Oxford,</HI> and all the Towns
adjacent; and at <HI>Abbington</HI> in particular they
have a Barley - Market, where you &s;ee
every Market - day four or five hundred
Carts and Waggons of Barley to be &s;old at
a time, &s;tanding in rows in the Market place,
be&s;ides the va&s;t quantity carry'd directly to
the Mal&s;ters hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The Malt-Trade thus encrea&s;ing, it &s;oon
came out of the hands of the Farmers; for
either the Farmers found &s;o much Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and to &s;o much advantage in the Malting
Trade, that they left off Ploughing, and put
off their Farms, &s;ticking wholly to the Malt;
or other Men, encouraged by the apparent
advantage of the Malting Trade, &s;et it up by
it &s;elf, and bought their Barley, as is &s;aid
above of the Farmers when their Malt Trade
fir&s;t encrea&s;ed, or both the&s;e together,
which is mo&s;t probable; and thus Malting
became a Trade by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Again, tho' the Farmers then generally
left off Malting in the manner as above;
yet they did not wholly throw them&s;elves
out of the profit of the Trade, but hir'd the
making of their own Malt; that is, to put
out their Barley to the Malt-hou&s;es to be
made on their account; and this occa&s;ion'd
many Men to erect Malt-hou&s;es chiefly to
make Malt only for other people, at &s;o
<PB N="41" REF="355">
much per Quarter, as they could agree;
and at intervals, if they wanted full em|ploy,
then they made it for them&s;elves: of
the&s;e I &s;hall &s;ay more pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>It is objected by &s;ome, that this Malting
or Malt-making is not a Trade, but a Manu|facture,
and that the Mal&s;ters, therefore,
&s;hou'd not be rank'd among the Trade&s;men,
of whom this Work has all along been &s;up|po&s;ed
to &s;peak.</P>
<P>But my an&s;wer will reconcile this by the
help of two di&s;tinctions.</P>
<Q><P>1. We mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between Trade&s;|men
that are Shopkeepers, and which
are properly &s;poken of in the former
part of this Work, and Trade&s;men,
who tho' they are dealers, and that
perhaps as coni&s;derably as the others,
yet by the cour&s;e of their Bu&s;ine&s;s,
tran&s;act their Affairs in another man|ner,
of whom there are a very great
variety, and whom we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h
not in this Trade of Malting only,
but in &s;everal other articles of Bu&s;ine&s;s,
of which we may have occa&s;ion to
&s;peak.</P>
<P>2. In this particular Trade of Malting,
we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e Mal|&s;ters
who make their Malt them&s;elves,
and &s;ell it either at home or at <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and who are very properly call'd
<PB N="42" REF="356">
Trade&s;men, and tho&s;e Mal&s;ters, who,
as above, are only working Mal&s;ters,
and make it for other Men, at a cer|tain
price per Quarter, for the mere la|bour
of the operation; the&s;e are indeed
Manufacturers of Malt, and with them
the Malt is a Manufacture and no more;
as in the City of <HI>London,</HI> there are
Gold&s;miths who keep Shops, &s;ell
wrought Plate, Rings, and &s;everal o|ther
things of Silver and Gold, and buy
old Plate; and the&s;e are very ju&s;tly cal|led
Trade&s;men, and di&s;tingui&s;h'd as &s;uch
by the name of Gold&s;miths; and there
are at the &s;ame time Plateworkers, who
Melt, Ca&s;t and Hammer up all &s;orts
of Plate and other valuable things of
Gold or Silver, and the&s;e are call'd
working Gold&s;miths or Silver&s;miths,
and are very properly call'd Smiths,
for they are mere Manufactuers and
Workmen, and the Plate, as it comes
out of their hands, is a Manufacture,
and no more.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e di&s;tinctions will &s;et us right in our
judging of who are, and who are not to be
call'd Trade&s;men in the &s;en&s;e of this di&s;|cour&s;e;
&s;o that when we direct our In&s;truc|tions
to the <HI>Complete Trade&s;man,</HI> we may
know who we are talking to, and who
not.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="357">
It is with, this di&s;tinction, that I menti|on'd
the Corn-factors in the la&s;t article be|fore
this as Trade&s;men, tho' they keep no
Shops; and they mu&s;t be mentioned again
here; becau&s;e as the Malt-Trade is now be|come
&s;o great, there are great numbers
of tho&s;e Factors who &s;ell no other Grain
(for Malt is &s;till a Grain) than Malt; and
are, as we may &s;ay, agents for the Mal&s;ters
who &s;tay in the Country, and only &s;end
up their Goods, and a&s;&s;i&s;tants to tho&s;e Mal|&s;ters
who come up them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The mentioning the&s;e Factors again here,
naturally brings me to ob&s;erve a new way
of buying and &s;elling of Corn, as well as
Malt, which is introduc'd by the&s;e Factors
a practice greatly encreas'd of late, tho' it is
an unlawful way of Dealing, and many
ways prejudicial to the Markets; and this
is buying of Corn by &s;amples only: the
ca&s;e is thus.</P>
<P>The Farmer that has perhaps twenty load
of Wheat in his Barn, rubs out only a few
handfulls of it with his hand, and puts it
into a little money bag, and with this &s;am|ple,
as 'tis call'd, in his pocket, away he goes
to Market.</P>
<P>When he comes there, he &s;tands with his
little bag in his hand at the particular
place where &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and there
the Factors or Buyers come al&s;o; the Factor
looks on the &s;ample, asks his price, bids, and
<PB N="44" REF="358">
then buys; and that not a &s;ack or a load, but
the whole quantity; and away they go to|gether
to the next Inn to adju&s;t the bar|gain.</P>
<P>This
adju&s;ting the bargain is thus; The Fac|tor
demands how much he has of the Corn,
he &s;ettles that at twenty load, more or le&s;s,
as the mow may come out; then how &s;oon
he can have it, ready thre&s;h'd, clean'd and
deliver'd, and the time is agreed on.</P>
<P>The Farmer inquires where he mu&s;t de|liver
it, which is generally agreed to be ei|ther
to &s;uch or &s;uch Hoys or Barges, or Ve&s;|&s;els,
as the neare&s;t navigation to the place;
or at &s;uch and &s;uch Mills, if it be Wheat,
as are neare&s;t to be ground at; (this la&s;t is,
if the buyer acts for a Meal-man or Miller.)
The next demand is the payment, and that
is adju&s;ted to be at the delivery, or per|haps
the Factor will be &s;o kind to the Far|mer
as to bring it to his hou&s;e, if not far
off; upon this the Factor gives earne&s;t, and
&s;o the whole barn, or &s;tack, or mow of
Corn is &s;old at once; and not only &s;o, but
'tis odds but the Factor deals with him ever
after by coming to his hou&s;e, and &s;o the
Farmer troubles the Market no more.</P>
<P>This kind of Trade is chiefly carried on in
tho&s;e Market-Towns which are at a &s;mall
di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> or at lea&s;t from the
River <HI>Thames;</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Rumford, Dartford,
Grayes, Roche&s;ter, Maid&s;tone, Chelmsford,
<PB N="45" REF="359">
Malden, Colche&s;ter, Ip&s;wich,</HI> and &s;o down
on both &s;ides the River to the <HI>North&s;ore|land;</HI>
and particularly at <HI>Margate,</HI> and
<HI>Whit&s;taple,</HI> on one &s;ide; and to the coa&s;t
of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and along the coa&s;t both ways
beyond, and likewi&s;e up the River; al&s;o</P>
<P>At the&s;e Markets you may &s;ee, that be|&s;ides
the Market-hou&s;e where a &s;mall quan|tity
of Corn perhaps is &s;een, the place men|tioned
above, where the Farmers and Fac|tors
meet is like a little exchange, where
all the re&s;t of the Bu&s;ine&s;s is tran&s;acted, and
where an hundred times the quantity of
Corn is bought and &s;old, as appears in &s;acks
in the Market-hou&s;e; it is thus in particu|lar
at <HI>Grayes,</HI> and at <HI>Dartford;</HI> and tho
on a Market-day there are very few Wag|gons
with Corn to be &s;een in the Market,
yet the Street or Market-place, nay, the
Towns and Inns are throng'd with Far|mers,
and &s;amples on one hand, and with
Meal-men, <HI>London</HI> - Bakers, Millers, and
Corn-Factors, and other Buyers on the other;
the re&s;t of the Week you &s;ee the Waggons
and Carts continually coming all Night,
and all Day, laden with Corn of all &s;orts to be
deliver'd on board the Hays, where the Hoy|men
&s;tand ready to receive it, and general|ly
to pay for it al&s;o; and thus a prodigious
Corn-Trade is manag'd in the Market, and
little or nothing to be &s;een of it.</P>
<P>Now tho' this is openly done, nor do I
<PB N="46" REF="360">
&s;ee it will be ever practicable to prevent it,
yet it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, that this is a
really clande&s;tine Trade, utterly unlawful,
and may &s;ometimes be very inconvenient, as
it opens the door to the fatal and forbid|den
Trade of engro&s;&s;ing, regrating, fore&s;tal|ling
the Markets, and the like, which in
ca&s;es of &s;carcity may be, and &s;ometimes has
been very injurious to the public, and e&s;pe|cially
to the poor.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a great injury to the Markets
as well to the Market-Towns, in prevent|ing
the concour&s;e of People, and hor&s;es,
and carriage to the place, which affects the
whole T&s;ade of that Market, as is vi&s;ible
in tho&s;e Towns where it is practis'd to a
great degree; as al&s;o to the Market, as a
property; for the Markets of <HI>England</HI> are
&s;requently the particular E&s;tates of private
Per&s;ons, and the Markets in Corporations
are generally the E&s;tate and Property of the
Corporation as a body Politic.</P>
<P>But it is not our bu&s;ine&s;s here to di&s;cour&s;e
of the Inju&s;tice in this part of Trade, but to
de&s;cribe it, and give an account that it is
&s;o. There are many branches of this Corn-Trade,
which vary as the circum&s;tances of
time, and of public Affairs influence it; by
which frequent prohibitions, and re&s;traints
are laid upon the Exportation, and &s;ome|times
Limitations of the price: But the&s;e
things are too long for this place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Principles and Subject of the
Home-Trade, about which our
Trade&s;men are more particularly
employ'd.</HEAD>
<P>THE Introduction having frequently
led me from &s;peaking of and to
the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
to the Trade it &s;elf, e&s;pecially as it is ex|plain'd
to mean the <HI>Home-Trade,</HI> exclu&s;ive
of the Merchandizing part of Bu&s;ine&s;s: I
am now of cour&s;e to &s;peak of the other
parts or branches of that Trade, not men|rioned
in the &s;aid Introduction; and it &s;eems
proper to di&s;patch the&s;e &s;everal branches
together, that our account of things may
not be confus'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Home-Trade</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as is noted
already, may be under&s;tood to con&s;i&s;t of
things produc'd at Home, or things im|ported
from Abroad; and as all the&s;e gradu|ally
come into the hands of the Trade&s;|man,
&s;o they more particularly become
the &s;ubject of the <HI>Home-Trade:</HI> The Goods
imported from abroad are bought by the
Trade&s;man from the Merchant importer;
the Goods produc'd at home are, in like
<PB N="48" REF="362">
manner, bought from the Grower or fir&s;t
Producer; &s;uch as Wool from the Gra&s;ier,
Corn from the Farmer, Metal from the
Miner, and the like; or from the Merchant
or Maker, &s;uch as 'Woollen Manufactures
from the Clothier, Cotton Manufactures
from the Maker, Leather from the Tanner,
Earthen-ware from the Potter, wrought
Iron from the Black-&s;mith, wrought Plate
from the Silver-&s;mith, <HI>and the like;</HI> and thus
the&s;e al&s;o become the &s;ubject of Trade,
and &s;o employ the Trade&s;men of whom I
have been &s;peaking.</P>
<P>Of the Goods imported from abroad and
bought of the Merchant, I have &s;poken in
the Introduction. The&s;e foreign Importa|tions
coming into the Shopkeeper's hands,
or into the hands of Manufacturers, who, as I
have &s;aid, are &s;o far the Con&s;umers, are
now no more to be treated as foreign, but
the branches of the general home Con&s;ump|tion,
and in part are the &s;upport of the
Trade&s;men of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next and chief article is our own
product or inland Goods in general, and
the&s;e, <HI>as above,</HI> are divided into two
heads.</P>
<Q><P>1. The mere product of NATURE, &s;uch as
are al&s;o mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> Wool,
Skins, Hides, Corn, Coals, Metals,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="363">
II. The product of ART, &s;uch as we more
particularly and properly call Manufac|ture.</P></Q>
<P>Both the&s;e are the &s;ubject of Trade, and
the &s;upport of the Trade&s;men of <HI>Great-Bri|tain,</HI>
of whom I am &s;peaking; and &s;ince 'tis
nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe them more particular|ly,
I &s;hall do it &s;o as that the Trade&s;man
may receive In&s;truction too in his bu&s;ine&s;s
from the de&s;cription, and &s;o make this part
of the Work u&s;eful to him, as a Trade&s;|man,
as well as the other. I begin with
the Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> are
&s;o prodigious in quantity, that the variety
of kinds is &s;carce taken notice of; nay,
&s;ome have their thoughts &s;o engro&s;s'd by
the Woollen and Clothing Manufacture,
that when you name the word Manufacture,
they wou'd under&s;tand nothing but the
Woollen Manufacture, they wou'd have it
be call'd THE <HI>Manufacture,</HI> as if there were
no Manufacture, or that nothing was to
be call'd a Manufacture, but what was made
of Wool; whereas <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as we
&s;hall &s;ee in its cour&s;e, has her people em|ploy'd
in many very u&s;eful Manufactures,
and that &s;uch as make very con&s;iderable
articles in our Commerce as well our home,
Trade as our foreign Trade, giving bu&s;i|ne&s;s
to the Trade&s;man and to the Mer|chant
<PB N="50" REF="364">
al&s;o, as it does likewi&s;e employment
and wages to the poor.</P>
<P>In giving an account of the&s;e Manufac|tures
it will be very u&s;eful to the Trade&s;man
to ob&s;erve, not only what the Manufactures
them&s;elves are, their names and kinds, but
where they are principally made, and in what
part of the Country, that &s;o the Trade&s;men
dealing in tho&s;e Goods may have at lea&s;t
a general notion of the Manufacture it &s;elf,
what it is, how made, and where to en|quire
after it.</P>
<P>But here, previous to the &s;everal &s;pecies
of the Woollen Manufacture, there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
ob&s;ervation to be made relating to the
fir&s;t and general operation of the thing call|ed
Wool; however plain and ea&s;y the road
of Manufacturing may be, or rather appears
to be, I mu&s;t let the Trade&s;men know, that
the apparatus in general is in it&s;elf very
con&s;iderable, and almo&s;t equal to the Ma|nufacture
it&s;elf; and that in order to under|&s;tand
the Manufacture, it is nece&s;&s;ary to
under&s;tand the &s;everal things done in or|der
to prepare the materials, and the many
hands tho&s;e materials pa&s;s thro' before they
come to the fini&s;her, or, as I may call him,
the Ma&s;ter Manufacturer who &s;ends them to
Market, by whom they come to the Trade&s;|man
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Wool and the Oil mentioned in
our beginning, as the great principles of
<PB N="51" REF="365">
the Manufacture in general, are brought by
differing channels to the hands of the Ma|nufacturer;
and indeed pa&s;s a long way in
the ordinary channel of Trade, before they
meet at the Clothier's hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The OIL has already been mention'd, it
chiefly comes from <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> a City in the
gulph of <HI>Otranto</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in the King|dom
of <HI>Naples,</HI> or from <HI>Seville,</HI> and <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and from <HI>Faro, Figuera, Lisbon,</HI> and
<HI>Oporto</HI> in <HI>Portugal;</HI> but the greate&s;t quan|tity
is that from <HI>Gallipoli;</HI> I need not add
that this is imported by the Merchant, bought
by the Trade&s;man, and &s;old to the Manu|facturer.</P>
<P>The
WOOL has many Channels as well
from Abroad as at Home.</P>
<P>I. Wool from Abroad makes only two
Articles.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Spani&s;h-wool,</HI> of which I need &s;ay no
more than as is &s;aid of the Oil, 'tis im|ported
from <HI>Spain</HI> by the Merchant,
and chiefly from <HI>Bilboa,</HI> is bought by
the Trade&s;man, &s;old again to the
Clothier, being mo&s;tly u&s;ed up with the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-wool, and mixt together, the
<HI>Spani&s;h</HI> being too fine, and &s;hort, to u&s;e
by it&s;lf, except in &s;ome particular goods.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Iri&s;h-wool,</HI> this comes over by allow|ance
&s;ettled by Parliament, and is only
admitted to be imported at the fol|lowing
<PB N="52" REF="366">

Minhead, Bri&s;tol,</HI> and <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P><HI>N. B.</HI> We have &s;ometimes, and in &s;mall
quantities, a good &s;ort of Wool from
<HI>Barbary,</HI> the <HI>African</HI> Wool being of
good &s;ub&s;tance, a long full &s;taple, and
not very coar&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It might be noted, that if the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were an indu&s;trious, diligent
People, and under&s;tood any thing of
Improvement, and e&s;pecially of Ma|nufacturing,
and wou'd furni&s;h them|&s;elves
with this Wool of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and
mix it with their own, it wou'd work
as well together as could be de&s;ir'd,
and they might make as good a Ma|nufacture
as our <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>-Cloths; but
they have neither the art or the appli|cation.</P></Q>
<P>Al&s;o we have &s;ometimes Wool import|ed
from <HI>Turkey</HI> and is called <HI>Caramania</HI>-Wool,
which is very good, but the quan|tity
is but &s;mall.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>Engli&s;h-Wool,</HI> This is the main
article, the &s;ub&s;tance of the whole Manu|facture,
and con&s;equently the chief article
in all the Home Trade of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But we mu&s;t not pa&s;s it over, that this
Wool takes a great many &s;everal turns
thro' a great many hands, and appears in
<PB N="53" REF="367">
many &s;everal Shapes, &s;uffers a great ma|ny
&s;everal Operations, and even alterations,
before it comes to the Manufacturer or
Clothier, and in tho&s;e various turns of its
&s;pecies, it may be &s;aid to be for &s;ome time
in the hands of the Trade&s;man, and is ma|naged
as an article of the Home-Trade, and a
very con&s;iderable article too; tho' afterwards
it cea&s;es to move in that channel, and be|comes
a material in the hand of the Labou|rer
or Manufacturer as you will &s;ee in its
order.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The Wool it&s;elf being taken from
the Sheeps back, either by (the Sheerer) the
Farmer, or by the Fellmonger from the
Skin, the Creature being dead, becomes a
&s;ubject of Trade, and is either &s;old to the Sta|pler,
that is the Wool-Merchant, and by him
to the Manufacturer, or is carried by the Far|mer,
and Fellmonger, as is &s;ometimes the
ca&s;e, to the particular Counties where it
is con&s;um'd.</P>
<P>The&s;e Staplers and Wool - dealers are
&s;eatter'd all over the Kingdom, and are a
very important and con&s;iderable &s;ort of
Trade&s;men, being the fir&s;t Trade&s;men into
who&s;e hands the &s;aid Wool comes for &s;ale;
the principal Towns in <HI>England,</HI> where they
are found to be in any numbers together, are
in <HI>London,</HI> or <HI>Southwark</HI> rather, being prin|cipally
in <HI>Barnaby-&s;treet,</HI> and the Town of
<HI>Blandford</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire;</HI> there are al&s;o
<PB N="54" REF="368">
&s;ome in <HI>Norwich</HI> and in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and
<HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire a great many.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sturbridge-$air</HI> is famous for the great
quantity of Wool &s;old there, and which
goes beyond any other Fairs or Markets in
all the North or Ea&s;t part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But wherever the Wool is carried, and
by whom&s;oever it is &s;old, this of cour&s;e
brings it to the fir&s;t part of its Manufactur|ing,
and this con&s;i&s;ts of two operations.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Combing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Carding.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>The Combers are a particular &s;et of Peo|ple,
and the combing a Trade by it&s;elf; the
carding on the other hand is chiefly done
by Workmen hired by the Clothiers them|&s;elves;
the Combers buy the Wool in the
Fleece, or in the Pack, and when it is comb|ed,
put it on to the next operation on their
own account; the Carding is generally done
by hired &s;ervants as above; the&s;e operati|ons
hand on the Wool to the next, which
is common to both, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Spining.</HI></P>
<P>But before it comes this length it re|quires
a prodigious number of People, Hor|&s;es,
and carriages (Carts or Waggons) to
carry it from place to place; for the People
of tho&s;e Countries where the Wool is
grown, or taken as above, are not the Peo|ple
who &s;pin it into Yarn.</P>
<P>On the contrary, &s;ome whole Counties
and parts of Counties are employ'd in Spin|ing,
<PB N="55" REF="369">
who &s;ee nothing of any Manufacture
among them, the mere Spining only ex|cepted.</P>
<P>Thus
the Weavers of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and of
the parts adjacent, and the Weavers of <HI>Spit|tlefields</HI>
in <HI>London,</HI> &s;end exceeding great
quantities of Wool into remote Counties
to be &s;pun, be&s;ides what they &s;pin in both
tho&s;e populous Counties of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and
<HI>Suffolk;</HI> particularly they employ almo&s;t the
whole Counties of <HI>Cambridge, Bedford,</HI>
and <HI>Hertford;</HI> and be&s;ides that, as if all this
part of <HI>England</HI> was not &s;ufficient for them,
they &s;end a very great quantity of Wool
one hundred and fifty Miles by Land-car|riage
into the North, as far as <HI>We&s;tmorland</HI>
to be &s;pun, and the Yarn is brought back
in the &s;ame manner to <HI>London,</HI> and to
<HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>This va&s;t Con&s;umption of Wool in <HI>Nor|folk</HI>
and <HI>Suffolk</HI> is &s;upply'd chiefly out of
<HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> a County famous for the large
breed of Sheep bred up for the &s;upply of
the <HI>London</HI>-Markets, as the <HI>We&s;tern</HI>-Manu|facturers
are &s;upply'd from <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> of
which in its place.</P>
<P>Nor is all this &s;ufficient &s;till, but as if all
<HI>England</HI> was not able to &s;pin &s;ufficient to
the Manufactures a very great quantity of
Yarn ready &s;pun, is brought from <HI>Ireland,</HI>
landed at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and brought from thence
<PB N="56" REF="370">
by Land-carriage to <HI>London,</HI> and then to
<HI>Norwich</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> a large and exceed|ingly
populous County, is chiefly taken up
with the great Manufacture of Bayes and
Perpets; the Con&s;umption of Wool for this
Manufacture is chiefly bought of the Sta|plers
in <HI>London;</HI> the &s;orting, oyling, comb|ing,
or otherwi&s;e preparing the Wool, is the
work of the Ma&s;ter Manufacturer or Bay|maker;
and the Yarn is generally &s;pun
in the &s;ame County, the extent of it be|ing
not le&s;s than between fifty and &s;ixty
Miles &s;quare, and full of great and popu|lous
Towns; &s;uch as <HI>Colche&s;ter, Braintree,
Cog&s;hall, Chelmsford, Billerecay, Bi&s;hop|&s;tafford,
Saffron-walden, Waltham, Rum|ford,</HI>
and <HI>innumerable</HI> &s;maller, but very po|pulous
Villages, and in a word, the whole
Country full of People.</P>
<P>The We&s;tern part of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uperior
both in Manufactures, and in numbers
of People al&s;o, are neither to be &s;upplied
either with Wool, or with Spining, among
them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding two &s;uch articles
in both, as no other part of <HI>England</HI> can
come up to, no, not by a great deal. (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>1. Notwith&s;tanding the innumerable
numbers of Sheep fed upon tho&s;e al|mo&s;t
boundle&s;s Downs, and Plains in
the Counties of <HI>Dor&s;et, Wilts, Glou|ce&s;ter,
<PB N="57" REF="371">
Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI>
where the multitudes, not of Sheep
only, but even of Flocks of Sheep, are
not to be reckon'd up; in&s;omuch that
the People of <HI>Dorche&s;ter</HI> &s;ay, there
are &s;ix hundred thou&s;and Sheep always
feeding within &s;ix Miles round that
one Town.</P>
<P>2. Notwith&s;tanding the large and mo&s;t po|pulous
Counties of <HI>Wilts, Somer&s;et,
Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> in which the
Manufacture being &s;o exceeding great,
all the Women Inhabitants may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to be thoroughly employ'd
in &s;pining the Yarn for them; and in
which Counties are, be&s;ides the popu|lous
Cities of <HI>Exce&s;ter, Salisbury, Wells,
Bath, Bri&s;tol,</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> I &s;ay, be|&s;ides
the&s;e the greate&s;t Towns, and the
greate&s;t number of them, that any o|ther
part of the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> can &s;hew; &s;ome of which
excced even the great Towns of <HI>Leeds,
Wake&s;ield, Sheffield,</HI> &amp;c. in the North;
&s;uch as, <HI>Taunton,</HI> Divizes, Tiverton,
Crediton, Brad&s;ord, Trowbridge, We&s;t|bury,
Froom, Stroud, Biddi&s;ord, Barn|&s;taple,
Dartmouth, Bridgewater, Min|head,

Blandford, Wimbourn, Sherborn, Ciren|ce&s;ter,
Honiton, Warmin&s;ter, Tewks|bury,
Tedbury, Stroud, Malmsbury,
<PB N="58" REF="372">
and abundance of others, too many to &s;et
down; all which I mention, becau&s;e tho&s;e
that pretend to have calculated the num|bers
of People employ'd in the&s;e four Coun|ties,
a&s;&s;ure me, that there are not &s;o few
as a million of People con&s;tantly employ'd
there, in Spining and Weaving, for the
Woollen Manufacture only; that be&s;ides
the great Cities, Towns and Sea-ports men|tion'd
above, there are not le&s;s than one hun|dred
and twenty Market Towns, &s;ix large
Cities, and fifteen hundred Pari&s;hes, &s;ome
of which are exceeding full of People.</P>
<P>And yet notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;uch is
the greatne&s;s of this prodigious Manufac|ture,
that they are &s;aid to take yearly thirty
thou&s;and packs of Wool, and twenty five
thou&s;and packs of Yarn ready &s;pun from
<HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, take a &s;hort view of the
middle part of <HI>England; Leice&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Nor|thampton,</HI>
and <HI>Warwick&s;hires,</HI> having an in|numerable
number of large Sheep, which,
as is &s;aid of <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> are bred for the
<HI>London</HI> Markets, the Wool con&s;equently is
of an exceeding long &s;taple, and the fine&s;s
is known al&s;o to be extraordinary.</P>
<P>This Wool is brought every week, <HI>Tue&s;|day</HI>
and <HI>Friday,</HI> to the Market at <HI>Cirence&s;|ter,</HI>
on the edge of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Wilts,</HI>
the quantity is &s;uppos'd to be at lea&s;t five
hundred packs of Wool per Week.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="373">
Here it is bought by the Wool-combers
and Carders of <HI>Tedbury, Malmsbury,</HI> and
the Towns on all that &s;ide of <HI>Wilts,</HI> and
<HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> be&s;ides what the Clothiers them|&s;elves
buy; The&s;e carry it out far and near
among the poor People of all the adjacent
Countries for the &s;pining, and having made
the Yarn they &s;upply that Manufacture as
far as <HI>Froom, Warmin&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Taunton,</HI> and
thus the We&s;t Country is furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The North requires another In&s;pection,
the re&s;t of the <HI>Leice&s;ter&s;hire</HI> Wool-Mer|chants,
who do not bring their Wool South|ward,
carry it forward to the North, to
<HI>Wake&s;ield, Leeds,</HI> and <HI>Hallifax;</HI> here they
mix it with, and u&s;e it among the Northern
Wool, which is not e&s;teem'd &s;o fine.</P>
<P>Not forgetting, not with &s;tanding, that they
have a great deal of very fine Wool, and
of a good &s;taple from the Woulds or Downs
in the Ea&s;t riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and from the
Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> more e&s;pecially the
Banks of the <HI>Tees,</HI> where for a long way, the
grounds are rich, and the Sheep thought
to be the large&s;t in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Hither all the fine&s;t Wool of tho&s;e Coun|tries
is brought, and the coar&s;er &s;ort, and
the Scots Wool, which comes into <HI>Halli|fax,</HI>
Rochdale, Bury, and the <HI>Manufacturing</HI>
Towns of <HI>Lanca&s;hire, We&s;tmoreland,</HI> and
<HI>Cumberland</HI> is employ'd in the coar&s;er Ma|nufactures
of tho&s;e Countrics, &s;uch as Ker|&s;ies,
<PB N="60" REF="374">
half-thicks, Yarn-&s;tockings, Duffelds;
Ruggs, <HI>Turkey-work</HI> Chairs, and many o|ther
u&s;eful things, which tho&s;e Countries
abound in.</P>
<P>Thus you have in as few Words as may
be, a Scheme of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Wool,
as it is the apparatus to the Woollen Manu|facture,
as well before it comes to be &s;pun
into the Yarn, as after.</P>
<P>It remains to give the Trade&s;man a like
view of the Manufacture it&s;ef, when fini&s;h|ed,

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of whom we are to under&s;tand by
the Trade&s;men of England, and
in who&s;e hands the va&s;t inland
Commerce of this Nation is carried
on; that the number of them is not
to be calculated, but it is be&s;t judg'd
of by reviewing and recon&s;idering
the magnitude of the &s;everal branch|es
of the home Trade, &s;uch as the
Corn and Wine Trade, Liquors
and Manufactures of all &s;orts.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Trade of <HI>England</HI> is exceeding
great, &s;o is the number of the Trade&s;|men
who carry it on. It is not
ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h who are Trade&s;men, and
who not, much le&s;s to calculate their num|bers;
and the particular Employments into
which they are divided are very many, but
for Brevity, I &s;hall reduce them, as I did in
the former Volume, to a very few.</P>
<Q><P>1. The <HI>Husbandman</HI> or Farmer, no nor
the Gra&s;ier, are not properly Trade&s;|men,
tho' they are &s;prings and wheels
<PB N="73" REF="387">
in the movement of Trade too, but
they are not Trade&s;men in the pre|&s;ent
&s;en&s;e of the Word.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Ma&s;ter-Manufacturer</HI> and Handi|craft,
are not Trade&s;men, tho' indeed
they are the very foundation of Trade.</P>
<P>3. The Retailer, including the Shopkeep|ers
of all &s;orts, are Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>4. The whole&s;ale Man, including &s;eve|ral
Trades, tho' not keeping either
Shops or Ware-hou&s;es.</P>
<P>5. The Carriers and Ma&s;ters of Ve&s;&s;els
for the coa&s;ting Bu&s;ine&s;s, who keeping
Servants and Carriages, are generally
con&s;irable Traders.</P>
<P>6. Brokers, and Buyers, and Sellers of
Cattle, Corn and other Provi&s;ions by
whole&s;ale for other Men.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e are the Men who carry on the
whole Trade of the Kingdom, and under
them almo&s;t all tho&s;e whom we call labour|ing
poor are maintain'd and employ'd.</P>
<P>1. The Farmer and Gra&s;ier, tho&s;e, as a|bove,
are not properly Trade&s;men; they em|ploy
under them the Cottagers and mere
Husbandmen, who Plow, Sow, Harve&s;t
and Carry out to Market the fir&s;t principles
of all Commerce, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Provi&s;ions for
the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the whole, &s;uch as Corn
and Cattle, Bread and Fle&s;h; the poor &s;er|vants,
which are employ'd by the&s;e Farmers
<PB N="74" REF="388">
and Gra&s;iers are numberle&s;s, and there is no
e&s;timate can be made of them, as well Men|&s;ervants
as Maid - &s;ervants, Dairy - maids,
Hou&s;e-maids, and maids for looking after
the Cows and Poultry, and the Families;
the&s;e I &s;ay, I do not call Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>2. The Manufacturer and Handicraft or
Arti&s;t of every kind; I do not mean the
working People, tho' many and mo&s;t of
them do work al&s;o, at lea&s;t they are far from
being idle, yet the&s;e are not among my li&s;t
of Trade&s;men; they are indeed the fir&s;t
&s;prings, the wheels in the whole move|ment
of the whole Manufacturing; they buy
the Wool, put it out to &s;pinning, and after
that to weaving, and under them employ and
&s;ub&s;i&s;t not many thou&s;ands only, but many
hundred thou&s;ands of poor People, who&s;e
dependence is wholly upon it; and the&s;e
are they who follow the Manufacture &s;o
well, &s;o effectually, &s;o fully, that they keep
up the goodne&s;s of the Manufactures to
their true &s;tandard and value, and to who&s;e
judgment and care is owing the great Cre|dit
and real E&s;teem of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>-woollen
Manufactures in foreign Parts, above all
the rival Manufactures, which are &s;o often,
and have been &s;o long attempted in other
Countries to their prejudice; yet the&s;e are
not Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>The next is the true <HI>Trade&s;man, viz.</HI> the
Factor employ'd by the &s;aid Manufacturer,
who &s;ells the Goods from the very fir&s;t hand to
<PB N="75" REF="389">
the Retailers and Merchants, the fir&s;t &s;elling
them at home, and the la&s;t exporting them
abroad. The&s;e indeed are real Trade&s;men,
and the chief of Trade&s;men; and tho' they
are but few, compared to the other heads,
and are chiefly re&s;ident in <HI>London,</HI> yet they
corre&s;pond with all the Nation, and may be
&s;aid to be the mo&s;t con&s;iderable both in
bu&s;ine&s;s, in credit, and in &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>La&s;tly the <HI>Retailer,</HI> this is the la&s;t and
fini&s;hing agent of Trade: All Commerce
ends in the Con&s;umption, and with the
con&s;umer; in this number are included all
the Country Shop-Keepers in <HI>England,</HI>
who&s;e number is not to be known, unle&s;s
&s;omebody &s;hould be &s;ent with <HI>Joab</HI> out to
number the People, which I hope will not
be attempted.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, in the Introduction to
this Work, how impo&s;&s;ible it is to make
any ju&s;t calculations, either of the magni|tude
of our inland Trade, the number of
the Trade&s;men, or the value and extent of
their Stocks, and the Commerce they drive;
nor &s;hall I undertake the unequal task here:
But I &s;hall give &s;ome little Specimens from
&s;uch particulars, as may be more ea&s;ily come
at, by which at lea&s;t it will appear, how
impracticable it is to make a regular and
exact Computation.</P>
<P>I al&s;o gave &s;ome hints from the prodigi|ous
expence of Carriage only, which at|tends
<PB N="76" REF="390">
the Commerce of this I&s;land: But
that article is not &s;ufficiently &s;poken to
there, nor was it intended to be &s;o; you
will therefore have &s;ome farther light into
it under the pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>We have in <HI>England</HI> near ten thou&s;and
Pari&s;hes, &s;ome indeed, and the mo&s;t in num|ber,
are but Villages, and thin of People:
But others again are very large and popu|lous
Towns, throng'd with Inhabitants, be|cau&s;e
full of bu&s;ine&s;s, and bigger than ma|ny
Cities; I might name &s;ome &s;maller,
which are yet very populous, &s;uch as <HI>Ware,
Chelmsford, King&s;ton, Uxbridge,</HI> and &s;eve|ral
&s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>There is hardly a Pari&s;h of all the ten
thou&s;and but has &s;ome of the&s;e Retailers in
them, and that &s;everal. On the other hand
&s;ome, and that not a few, have many hun|dreds,
nay, perhaps a thou&s;and in a Pari&s;h, in
&s;uch great Pari&s;hes as tho&s;e I have mention'd.</P>
<P>We are told that there are in the Pari&s;h
of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> above 60000 People, in that
of <HI>Hallifax</HI> 100000 Communicants, in
<HI>Sheffield</HI> 50000, in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> 20000, in
<HI>Froome</HI> 50000, and &s;o in proportion in o|ther
places.</P>
<P>We are told al&s;o there are ten Trading|Towns
in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> the We&s;t - riding of
<HI>Tork&s;hire,</HI> and the adjacent Country, which
have mo&s;t of them not above one Pari&s;h,
and none above two, and in mo&s;t of them
<PB N="77" REF="391">
the highe&s;t Magi&s;trate is a Con&s;table, and
yet have each of them more People than
the City of <HI>York,</HI> and &s;ome of them twen|ty
times as much Trade; &s;uch are <HI>Warring|ton,
Manche&s;ter, Macclesfield, Liverpool,
Hallifax, Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Don|ca&s;ter,
Huthersfield;</HI> in all the&s;e the num|ber
of Shop-Keepers, Retailers, and &s;uch as
come under the proper denomination of
Trade&s;men, are infinite, by which I mean
not to be calculated by any rule, or gue&s;t
at by any proportions.</P>
<P>There are abundance of other very popu|lous
Trading and Manufacturing Towns in
<HI>England,</HI> which may have from two to four
or five Pari&s;hes, the number of who&s;e Trade&s;|men,
as well whole&s;ale as retail, is not to
be reckon'd up; &s;uch as <HI>Hull, Birmingham,
New Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne, Leice&s;ter, Notting|ham,
Taun$on, Reading, Plymouth, Port&s;|mouth,
Roche&s;ter,</HI> and abundance more, too
many to name; and experienc'd Trade&s;man,
who I am ju&s;t now conver&s;ing with upon
this Head, bids me &s;et it down upon his
Credit, and that he will be oblig'd to De|mon&s;trate
it upon any ju&s;t occa&s;ion, that
there are fixty thou&s;and Trade&s;men in the
particular denomination of a Trade&s;man as
here de&s;crib'd, within the County of <HI>Nor|folk</HI>
only; and he adds, that he believes there
are not le&s;s than an hundred thou&s;and, if I al|low
tho&s;e to be Trade&s;men who are deal|ers
<PB N="78" REF="392">
in Wool, in &s;pun Yarn, and in the
Manufactures of Stuffs made all over that
County, and are not Makers, and &s;everal
Traders of other kind, all which I mu&s;t ac|knowledge
ought to be reckon'd Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>If this is true, then there may be two mil|lions
of Trade&s;men, including their Ser|vants,
Prentices and Journeymen in <HI>Great|Britain;</HI>
for I have yet &s;aid nothing of <HI>Scot|land,</HI>
where the number of Trade&s;men are
very con&s;iderable al&s;o, and their Trade con|&s;iderable
too; but this number however I
take to be of the mo&s;t.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, I have not yet reckon'd
tho&s;e travelling Trade&s;men who we call
<HI>Manche&s;ter-Men,</HI> and tho&s;e who carry <HI>Leeds</HI>-Cloth,
Ker&s;ies and <HI>York&s;hire</HI>-cloth of all
&s;orts upon Hor&s;es all over <HI>Britain,</HI> who
are &s;ome of them very con&s;iderable Dealers,
and furni&s;h the Shop-Keepers all over <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
with their Goods, without cutting or
retailing any thing. Al&s;o,</P>
<P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e who travel and go from
Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e &s;elling by retail, and who
are properly Pedlars, and call'd by that
name; many of which do al&s;o keep Shops
or Chambers, or Warehou&s;es, in the adja|cent
Market-Towns, and &s;ell their Goods
in the Villages round. The&s;e all come un|der
the title of Trade&s;men; they are by &s;ome
call'd Petty-chapmen, and the number of
them is very great, tho' as &s;ome think not
<PB N="79" REF="393">
&s;o great as they have formerly been, which
however is a que&s;tion does not relate to
my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>Under the&s;e denominations the general
Commerce of this Kingdom is carried on,
the home made Manufactures di&s;pers'd and
circulated, and the foreign Importations
handed about to the la&s;t con&s;umer.</P>
<P>It is true, this Calculation makes a pro|digious
number of People be employ'd in
Trade; and &s;o no que&s;tion there are, how
el&s;e &s;hould the Trade it &s;elf, which is &s;o
immen&s;ely great, be carried on? and how
el&s;e &s;hould the &s;upplying the whole Nation,
Men, Women and Children, with all &s;orts
of Provi&s;ions, Clothes, Hou&s;e-furniture, Eat|ables
and Drinkables be managed?</P>
<P>There are al&s;o abundance of other People
who mu&s;t &s;till come into the li&s;t of Trade&s;|men,
be&s;ides tho&s;e already nam'd, and who
are certainly Trade&s;men. For example,
All our Brewers and Di&s;tillers, and the
Dealers in many things relating to them,
as the Hop-Merchants, Hoop and Stave|Merchants
for their Cask, nay, the Iron|Merchants
for their Iron-hoops; and to
join them together, all the Vintners, Inn|holders,
Alehou&s;e-Keepers, and that pro|digiou&s;ly
multiplied article of Strong-wa|ter
Shops, the&s;e are all Trade&s;men; and as
&s;uch, were it worth while, I might fill up
this Book with needful In&s;tructions for
<PB N="80" REF="394">
their particula Government, and all little
enough; for how &s;hou'd they be tyed up by
rules who are encouragers of the re&s;t of man|kind,
to live without rule or Government?</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e have the mo&s;t need of In&s;truc|tion:
However, as the In&s;truction to them,
and to &s;uch as them, regards rather their
morals and manners, than their manage|ment
of bu&s;ine&s;s, I omit it here, that part
being not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this tract; be&s;ides,
who &s;hou'd go about to direct or govern
tho&s;e people, who, I &s;ay, are the ruin of all
the Nation, as to Government and ma|nagement
of them&s;elves?</P>
<P>The&s;e are a &s;ort of People that indeed
not only live without morals, but that
Trade without method; they generally go on
like their Cu&s;tomers, and carry on their
Trade, as if they were always drunk; keep
no Books but their Slate, and no Pen and
Ink but their Chalk and their Tallies; they
live without rule, Trade without order,
they thrive by mere chance, as Cu&s;tomers
come in, and when they grow rich, 'tis by the
nece&s;&s;ity of their affairs, the World reels in
upon them as their Cu&s;tomers reel out; they
live by the &s;ins of the People, and they are
a collection of &s;inners again&s;t the People,
for they break almo&s;t all the known laws
of Government in the Nation.</P>
<P>Yet their number is prodigious great,
and they are hardly to be reckoned up; and
<PB N="81" REF="395">
we mu&s;t admit them into the cla&s;s of Trade&s;|men,
there is no remedy, for they buy and
fell, trade on this &s;ide, and that, and are
no Manufacturers on one hand or on the
other.</P>
<P>The Butchers are al&s;o Trade&s;men, and
particularly that part of them of which we
have a great many in <HI>London,</HI> call'd car|ca&s;e
Butchers, that is to &s;ay, whole&s;ale Butch|ers,
who kill the meat in great quantities,
and fell it out to the Butchers in the out|parts
and in the Villages and Towns near the
City; the&s;e are indeed the more con&s;idera|able
of the kind, but the retail Butchers are
Trade&s;men too, for they buy and &s;ell con|tinually.</P>
<P>Hor&s;e-cour&s;ers,
or Jockeys and Hor&s;e-deal|ers,
are al&s;o Trade&s;men, &s;o are the buyers
and &s;ellers of Cattle, whether fat or lean, I
mean &s;uch as act between the Breeder and
the Butcher; and between the Breeder and
the Feeder, of which there are great num|bers
in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ome are called Sales-men,
&s;ome Cow-jobbers, &s;ome Dealers, &s;ome
Brokers, and many of them Factors; as par|ticularly
the buyers of Chee&s;e, Butter, Corn
and Malt are called Factors.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many more kinds of Dealers
may be called Trade&s;men, tho' they keep
neither Shop or Ware-hou&s;e, and of the&s;e
the number is beyond all account.</P>

The fir&s;t value of the&s;e Wines in the
Countries from whence they come is not
great, in compari&s;on to the value when
they come to the pint pot, as they call it,
that is to the Retailer. But the duties of
Importation, the freight to the Ships, the
expences attending it, the landing, the ma|naging,
hou&s;ing, carrying from place to
place, Cellerage, Cooperage, and the like;
the&s;e put all together make the value of this
Trade, reckoning it at the rate to the la&s;t

<P>Take the u&s;ual Tavern rate of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI>

this amounts to 40 pounds <HI>per</HI> Pipe; if we

take the e&s;timation upon the lowe&s;t value
<PB N="86" REF="400">
of the &s;ale of Wine in <HI>England,</HI> to a|mount
to 2514824<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> o <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner I rate the quantity, as ap|pears
above, much under what is every Year
imported; &s;o that I cannot be taxed with
a fal&s;e Computation, if I in&s;i&s;t that the va|lue
of the Wines &s;old in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> a|mounts
to three millions <HI>per</HI> annum.</P>
<P>As the quantity of Wine is thus great,
the number of people (Trade&s;men) who are
employed in buying, &s;elling, carrying and
di&s;po&s;ing this va&s;t quantity of Wines, are
al&s;o great in Proportion; and there is &s;o ju&s;t
a connection between the quantity of
Goods in Trade, and the number of Trade&s;|men
managing and carrying on the Trade,
that I know no better way to form an Idea
of one, than by a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the other.</P>
<P>When we &s;ee a va&s;t Circulation, a pro|digious
Importation, and know the mighty
Con&s;umption of the Goods, it is mo&s;t na|tural
to conclude, there is a number of Peo|ple
equal to the Employment employ'd in
the vent of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> is the next clau&s;e in
the Article of Liquors con&s;um'd in <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
the gro&s;s quantity brew'd in <HI>Great|Britain</HI>
is not ea&s;ily calculated; becau&s;e the
exci&s;e is no rule to judge it by, great quan|tities
being brewed which are not for &s;ale,
and con&s;equently pay no exci&s;e; but as the
quantity brewed for &s;ale is only concerned
<PB N="87" REF="401">
in the ca&s;e before us, namely the judging of
the numbers of Trade&s;men (that is publick
Hou&s;e-Keepers) employ'd in the venting and
di&s;po&s;ing of it, &s;o a gue&s;s may be made.</P>
<P>The numbers of Ale-hou&s;es and Inn-Keep|ers
in <HI>England</HI> are &s;aid by ordinary com|putation
to be above 200000; and indeed I
believe that calculation to be very much
within compa&s;s; e&s;pecially if all tho&s;e Ta|verns,
who likewi&s;e &s;ell Malt Liquors, are
taken into the number.</P>
<P>The quantity of Liquors the&s;e hou&s;es di&s;|po&s;e
of mu&s;t be prodigious great; e&s;pecial|ly
if we con&s;ider the exce&s;&s;ive draft, which
&s;ome of tho&s;e Publick hou&s;es have; particu|larly
in this City, and in &s;ome other Towns
of great concour&s;e of People, Hou&s;es on the
great Roads, in Sea-port Towns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
the like, of di&s;tilled Spirits.</P>
<P>But the be&s;t calculation of the quantity of
drink brew'd, is to be taken from the quan|tity
of Malt made; &s;ince all the Malt, ex|cept
a very &s;mall quantity exported, is ei|ther
brew'd into Beer and Ale, di&s;tilled
into Spirits, or fermented into Vinegar.
Now the quantity of Malt is thus to be
&s;tated. The Malt-tax before <HI>Scotland</HI> came
in to pay their Proportion, amounted one
Year to 660000 <HI>l.</HI> and it is generally now
given for 600000, that is to &s;ay, to bring
in &s;o much clear of the Collection.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="402">
If then it brings in 660000 pounds in|cluding
the charge of collecting, the
quantity is ea&s;ily computed; for the duty
being &s;ix-pence <HI>per</HI> Bu&s;hel, or four &s;hillings
<HI>per</HI> quarter, the que&s;tion is, how many &s;ix|pences
there are in &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty
thou&s;and pound; there being ju&s;t forty &s;ix|pences
in twenty &s;hillings, or a pound, it is
ea&s;ily ca&s;t up, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is twenty &s;ix
millions four hundred thou&s;and &s;ix-pences,
and con&s;equently, ju&s;t &s;o many Bu&s;hels of
Malt made in <HI>England,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI>
came in to pay the &s;ame Tax with us. But
then here is not any allowance for the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment,
as they call it, of the Officers
Sallaries in Collecting, all which is paid out
of the Duty, and con&s;equently &s;o much more
Malt made to pay it.</P>
<P>The &s;um of the account then is, that
there is twenty &s;ix millions four hundred
thou&s;and Bu&s;hels, or three millions three
hundred thou&s;and Quarters of Malt made
in <HI>England</HI> in a Year, be&s;ides &s;o much as
pays the Officers Sallaries, that collect it,
and incident charges, which is a very con|&s;iderable
article al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is true, they tell us there is a very great
quantity of this Malt di&s;till'd into Spirits,
and al&s;o fermented as above into Vinegar;
but of all this I do not find they pretend
to above 300000 quarters; &s;o that the Beer
and Ale mu&s;t be found to make up the re&s;t,
<PB N="89" REF="403">
which makes the brew'd part alone to be
three millions of Quarters.</P>
<P>In the &s;trong Beer brewing they calculate
ordinarily three barrels upon a quarter, &s;o
that if there are three millions of quarters
brew'd, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to make nine
millions of Barrels of &s;trong Beer, &s;uppo&s;ing
no &s;mall Beer to be made; but as a very
great quantity of &s;mall Beer is al&s;o brew'd
for and by &s;mall Families, the number of
the whole mu&s;t be prodigiou&s;ly greater, tho'
not all of &s;trong Beer; if then &s;uch an im|men&s;e
quantity of Malt is brew'd and di&s;till'd,
what a prodigious number of Trade&s;men
of all &s;orts mu&s;t be employ'd in venting,
(that is) in retailing this Beer and Ale?</P>
<P>This leads me of cour&s;e to enquire into
the other branches of our Liquid Trade,
which occa&s;ions al&s;o a very great bu&s;ine&s;s,
&s;uch as,</P>
<P>1. Di&s;tilling, a new Trade in <HI>England,</HI> is
encreas'd to a prodigious degree, by an acci|dent
in our Commerce, which was the Pro|hibition
of Brandy from <HI>France;</HI> not that
our drinking of Brandy and Spirits is &s;o
very much encreas'd: But upon the rai&s;ing
the price of foreign Brandy, fir&s;t by an ab|&s;olute
Prohibition, and then by a Duty of
two and fifty pound <HI>per</HI> Ton upon the Im|portation,
the dearne&s;s occa&s;ion'd the &s;top
to the Con&s;umption, and this encourag'd
the Di&s;tilling Trade at home, and put
<PB N="90" REF="404">
the Di&s;tillers upon exerting their skill to
&s;uch a degree, as we &s;ee it rai&s;ed to at this
time; in which they are come to &s;uch Per|fection,
that the ordinary People are now
&s;o very well &s;atisfied with their Malt Spirits,
and e&s;pecially with their new Compo&s;itions,
that they do not &s;eek <HI>French</HI>-Brandy in
&s;uch a manner as they formerly did.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain that in the Years 1687
and 1688 when the Trade with <HI>France</HI> was
open, and the duty paid upon the Importa|tion
of Brandy was but nine pound <HI>per</HI> Ton,
there was imported and con&s;equently con|&s;um'd
in this Nation from <HI>France</HI> in one
Year from 9000 to 11000 Ton of Brandy;
a quantity, which were it imported now,
wou'd be an expence almo&s;t equal to the
common nett charge of all the Liquors
drank in <HI>England</HI> put together, I mean
clear of Exci&s;e: for example,</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the quantity at a medium of
Years to amount to 10000 Ton in a Year,
and &s;uppo&s;e this Brandy to amount in <HI>France</HI>
but to 10 pound <HI>per</HI> Ton, let us &s;ee the

<P>We find &s;ince the&s;e Prohibitions very
great quantities of Brandy run by the arts
<PB N="91" REF="405">
of Clande&s;tine Traders; but even that
quantity is now much abated, except in the
North parts and We&s;t parts, &s;ince the Di&s;|tillers
have found out a way to hit the
palate of the Poor, by their new fa&s;hion'd
compound Waters call'd <HI>Geneva;</HI> &s;o that
the common People &s;eem not to value the
<HI>French</HI>-Brandy as u&s;ual, and even not to
de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>That this Di&s;tilling Trade, as thus im|proved
and encrea&s;ed, adds exceedingly to
the numbers of our Trade&s;men, and has
even erected &s;everal new &s;pecies of Traders,
which were little or not at all known or
under&s;tood before, I need go no farther for
a proof of, than an account laid before
the Hou&s;e of Commons the very la&s;t Year
1726 in behalf of the Di&s;tillers, and to
&s;hew the Hou&s;e how u&s;eful they were to
the publick; in which account, to make it
appear that they ought to be encouraged,
and the Trade pre&s;erved and nouri&s;hed by
the Government, as a thing upon which
the publick pro&s;perity very much depended,
they offered the following heads to the
Parliament's con&s;ideration.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. That the Di&s;tillers in and about <HI>Lon|don</HI>
only, con&s;um'd annually 200000
quarters of Malt, the Growth of our
own Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That be&s;ides this, they con&s;ume a
<PB N="92" REF="406">
very great quantity of Mela&s;&s;es, the
Product of our own Colonies, which
ought to be e&s;teem'd our own Pro|duce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That be&s;ides Malt and Mela&s;&s;es, they
con&s;umed from 10 to 15000 hog&s;heads
of Cyder every Year, and &s;ometimes
more, be&s;ides a great quantity of damag|ed
Wines, which would otherwi&s;e by
Act of Parliament be &s;tav'd and &s;pilt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. They in&s;i&s;ted that by the Con&s;ump|tion
of Malt they employ'd above
100000 Acres of Land; this they al|ledg'd
was true, becau&s;e the Malt they
u&s;ed being of an inferior quality, the
Lands it generally grew upon were
poor, and might be &s;uppo&s;ed not to
yield above 2 quarters upon an Acre.
<HI>N. B.</HI> It added to the merit of
this Trade, that it employ'd and oc|ca&s;ion'd
the cultivating &s;o much
Land of that kind that would other|wi&s;e
lye wa&s;te and until'd; al&s;o
that the Cattle employ'd in the Hus|bandry
of the Land, and in the
Carriage of the &s;aid Malt from place
to place, be&s;ides the Water Carri|age,
the Hor&s;es &s;o employ'd mu&s;t con|&s;ume
the Growth of many thou&s;ands
of Acres more.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. They made it appear al&s;o, that they paid
in the bare Exci&s;e of the Liquors, thus
<PB N="93" REF="407">
di&s;till'd, above an hundred thou&s;and
pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to the Govern|ment,
be&s;ides 200000 &s;ix-pences, which
is 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a year by the exci&s;e upon
the Malt, and be&s;ides the duty upon
Coals, the exci&s;e upon the Cyder and
the Cu&s;tom of the Mela&s;&s;es.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The&s;e were the Allegations brought in
by the Di&s;tillers to &s;hew to the Parliament
what u&s;eful People they were, how nece&s;&s;a|ry
in the Common-wealth, how a&s;&s;i&s;tant
to the Government, in paying &s;uch great
&s;ums to the publick Funds and the like.</P>
<P>And all the&s;e arguments &s;erve in their
turn, to &s;hew what numbers of Trade&s;men
they have &s;et up, what a great &s;hare of bu|&s;ine&s;s
they &s;upply, what &s;tocks, what poor
People they employ; and &s;o it brings them
down to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>It is true, that the&s;e Liqours are &s;old as
<HI>Addenda</HI> to other Trades, by the Chandlers,
Grocers, Inn-Keepers, Victuallers, and the
like; But let us ca&s;t our Eyes about us, and
in the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> and parts adjacent,
we may &s;ee a prodigious number of Shop|keepers
who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s is wholly and &s;olely
the &s;elling of Spirits and Strong-waters, as we
call them, and nothing el&s;e; and I am told
there are in <HI>England</HI> &s;ome thou&s;ands of
&s;uch, more than was ever known before.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I &s;hould add here, that
the Advice to the Complete Trade&s;men
<PB N="94" REF="408">
ought to have be&s;towed a little pains upon
the&s;e Gentlemen call'd Strong-water Men,
who&s;e &s;hare in ruining the Peoples Morals,
as well as their Health, is too great, not to
require that they &s;hou'd be animadverted
upon; let them take this gentle hint, they
know how to reform it.</P>
<P>But to bring it home to the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e,
'tis evident to common ob&s;ervation,
that the&s;e Additions to the Trade in Li|quors
are not trifles in the inland Com|merce
of the Nation; and 'tis upon that
Foundation, that the&s;e Calculations are
made.</P>
<P>The Cyder Trade may perhaps be thought
a trifle, too mean to mention here; but I &s;hall
put the Trade&s;men in mind, that thro'
&s;everal Counties in <HI>England</HI> Cyder is, at
lea&s;t for many Miles together, the common
draft of the Peoples drink; and that even
in their Publick-hou&s;es, there are no Malt
Liquors &s;old at all, and in others but very
little, as I can te&s;tifie of my own knowledge,
in the Shires of <HI>Worce&s;ter, Glouce&s;ter</HI> and
<HI>Hereford,</HI> and the like in <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI> and
<HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire;</HI> from whence they tell us
they &s;hip off twenty thou&s;and hog&s;heads of
Cyder a Year to <HI>London,</HI> as is mentioned
above, &s;o that Cyder, as a Trade, is far from
being incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>All the&s;e articles, however trifling in them|&s;elves,
become con&s;iderable in the ca&s;e be|fore
<PB N="95" REF="409">
us, namely, that as they pa&s;s thro' many
hands, between the Growth and the Con|&s;umption,
and go thro' &s;ome particular O|perations
in the pa&s;&s;age, they by that means
are a medium of Commerce, and add a
very great number to the general ma&s;s of
Trade&s;men; &s;uch as to whom the&s;e two
Volumes are addre&s;&s;ed, and e&s;pecially to
tho&s;e Trade&s;men, who, as I &s;aid above, do
not come into the cla&s;s of Shop-Keepers or
Ware-hou&s;e keepers.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here, and indeed it wou'd
very well take up a whole Chapter, to give
&s;ome particular In&s;tructions to tho&s;e Trade&s;|men
I call Publick-hou&s;e-Keepers, Vint|ners,
Victuallers, Inn-Keepers and the like;
how they &s;hou'd carry on their Trades like
Men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and perhaps, in the end,
not le&s;s to the advantage of their Families,
without prompting the Pot and the Gla&s;s, and
as the Text calls it, putting the Bottle to
their Neighbour's No&s;e, in a gro&s;s and &s;can|dalous
manner, as is generally the practice;
making them&s;elves Brokers to the <HI>Devil,</HI>
and tempters to Vice, merely for the getting
two-pence or three-pence, or perhaps &s;ix|pence
extraordinary &s;pent in their hou&s;e;
I think I need not explain my &s;elf, the
ordinary Practice of tho&s;e People, and the
Cu&s;tom of their hou&s;es (tho&s;e Tabernacles
of <HI>Bacchus</HI>) de&s;cribe it too plainly, and I
&s;hall &s;peak of it by it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="410">
This makes the name of an Ale-hou&s;e a
&s;candal, and the very Employment, which
wou'd otherwi&s;e be as reputable as other
Trades, is placed under Licen&s;e, as if it was
needful to keep them under the awe of the
Magi&s;trate, and keep a check upon them,
that they might take better care of their
conduct, on the pain of having their Li|cen&s;es
taken from them, and their Shops, as
we may &s;ay, &s;hut up.</P>
<P>That a Victualler or Ale-hou&s;e-Keeper
may be a very hone&s;t Trade&s;man is cer|tainly
true; and I might give an account
of &s;everal within my own knowledge of
the World that are &s;o; 'tis a di&s;a&s;ter to them,
however it came to pa&s;s, to be &s;o &s;tated in
the World as to be engaged in an Employ|ment
that &s;ubjects them to reproach, and
that implies a Crime even in the nece&s;&s;ity
of carrying it on; but with a careful and
circum&s;pect management, how ea&s;y is it
for them to e&s;tabli&s;h a Reputation for a
quiet, calm, mode&s;t and well govern'd hou&s;e;
and to found that Reputation upon the foot
of a ju&s;t, exact and regular conduct in the
management of their bu&s;ine&s;s, let the na|ture
of it be what it will?</P>
<P>I have &s;een &s;ome Inn-Keepers in particu|lar,
manage their bu&s;ine&s;s with all the ex|actne&s;s
of right and thorough bred Trade&s;|men,
keep their Hou&s;es, their Stables, their
Cellars, their Books, all with &s;uch care,
<PB N="97" REF="411">
&s;uch con&s;tant Application, &s;uch regular Di&s;|po&s;itions
of things, one apart from ano|ther,
that there has not been the lea&s;t di&s;|order
about them.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e have large Farms upon
their hands dependent upon their Inns,
and &s;ome the Po&s;t-hou&s;e; and that too, where
they have had a large branch in their hands,
and &s;everal by-bags and by-roads to direct,
and to keep the accounts of, yet do all
with the utmo&s;t readine&s;s, and perhaps, be
their own Brewers al&s;o at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>Will any one deny that the&s;e are to be
call'd Trade&s;men? 'tis apparent that they are
not only Trade&s;men, but &s;ome of the mo&s;t
&s;ignificant Trade&s;men that bear that name;
and this, e&s;pecically when they come to
have had extraordinary bu&s;ine&s;s, as is often
the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>But it mu&s;t be allow'd, that together with
the&s;e &s;ober, grave and &s;ub&s;tantial Trade&s;|men,
there are abundance of &s;coundrel, &s;or|ry,
griping, &s;harping Fellows, who neither
merit the name or the character; and that
the&s;e are embark'd in the de&s;troying the
morals of the Nation, and the health and
livelyhood of the People, and to them a
Chapter of advice wou'd have been very
&s;ea&s;onable; but it is enough to tell &s;uch,
they are the reproach of the employment,
which but for their ill conduct&punc; $$ight be
<PB N="98" REF="412">
as reputable, as hone&s;t, and as free from
vices as any other employment.</P>
<P>I have heard much of the exce&s;&s;ive drink|ing
among the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Germans,</HI>
and e&s;pecially in the Provinces of <HI>We&s;tpha|lia</HI>
and the Lower-<HI>Saxony;</HI> where they Brew
great quantities of Beer, and Mum, and have
plenty of Wine be&s;ides: But I believe I
may venture to challenge all the World to
&s;hew the like quantity of Beer, and Ale, and
Wine, and Cyder, and Brandy, Arrack and
Geneva, and other Strong-waters, con&s;um'd
in &s;o narrow a compa&s;s of Land, or among
an equal number of People, as is now in
this our Country of <HI>England;</HI> nor is it
po&s;&s;ible there can be a like number of
Trade&s;men employ'd in the Management.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Ro&s;tock,</HI> in the Duke of
<HI>Mecklemburgh</HI>'s Country, is famous for its
Brewery, and for the great quantity of Beer
they Brew there, and export to other Coun|tries;
and it is indeed the principal Trade
of the whole Port; yet I am inform'd
that there may be found two Brewing|offices
in <HI>London,</HI> which Brew more Beer
than all that City; and if it is true, as I be|lieve
it is, that there are two Brewers in
<HI>London</HI> who Brew each of them 1000 Bar|rels
a Week, which makes 104000 Barrels
a Year, I believe <HI>Ro&s;tock</HI> cannot go be|yond
it.</P>
<P>It is not much to the purpo&s;e here to
<PB N="99" REF="413">
cnter into the particular proportions, be|tween
the Beer and Ale, and that of Bran|dy
and Strong-waters, and the Per&s;ons em|ploy'd
in &s;elling, venting and putting off
tho&s;e Liquors, the number of the fir&s;t bear|ing
no proportion to the numbers of the
la&s;t, except in <HI>London</HI> only; but it mu&s;t of
nece&s;&s;ity be very great.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the Foundation laid, on
which to rai&s;e an e&s;timate of the numbers
of the Trade&s;men in this Kingdom; and
really if all the &s;chools of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> all the
Hou&s;es that &s;ell Liquors, and entertain loo&s;e

reckon'd among the hone&s;t Trade&s;men, as
I do not &s;ee it can be otherwi&s;e; we mu&s;t

that could po&s;&s;ibly be made, and wou'd
ruin thou&s;ands of Families: <HI>For Exam|ple$:</HI></P>
<P>Suppo&s;e
an Act of Parliament were
to pa&s;s to prohibit the wearing of Pe|rukes,
an extravagance which no Nation
ever run into like this, except the <HI>French:</HI>
But &s;hou'd &s;uch a Law pa&s;s, how many
thou&s;and Hair-Merchants, Periwig-makers
and their Dependances mu&s;t &s;ink, want Em|ployment,
and be undone? the like might
be &s;aid of &s;everal other things.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e a like Law &s;hou'd pa&s;s again&s;t
wearing Silver or Gold either in Buttons,
or Lace, embroidery, or any other way, as
it was (before the Union) in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
as during the late War, was &s;trictly enjoin'd
in <HI>France;</HI> but how many Silver and Gold-wire-Drawers,
Embroiderers, Lace-makers,

&s;hut up Shop, and be undone? and
&s;o of other Employments.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e publick calamities &s;hou'd reduce
our Pride to &s;uch a degree, as that no Bone|lace
&s;hou'd be allow'd to be worn in all
his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, what a blow wou'd
<PB N="101" REF="415">
it be to the Employment of the Poor in
tho&s;e Counties, where &s;o many thou&s;ands
of poor People gain their Bread by that Ma|nufacture?
and the like of many other parts
of the Ladies Dre&s;&s;es, which however need|le&s;s,
and however the mere effect of Pride
and Luxury, are yet by cu&s;tom become ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to our Commerce, by which means
the Luxury of the People is become a ver|tue
in Trade.</P>
<P>If a due Calculation were made of all the
&s;everal Trades be&s;ides Labouring, Manufac|turing
and Handicraft Bu&s;ine&s;s, which are
&s;upported in this Nation merely by the
Sins of the People, <HI>as I may call them,</HI> I
mean the &s;umptuary Trades, the Ribbons,
the Perfumes, the Silks, the Cambricks, the
Mu&s;lins, and all the numberle&s;s Gayeties of
Dre&s;s; as al&s;o by the Gluttony, the Drunk|enne&s;s,
and other exorbitances of Life, it
might remain a que&s;tion, whether the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
or the unnece&s;&s;ary were the greate&s;t
ble&s;&s;ing to Trade; and whether reforming
our Vices wou'd not ruin the Nation.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard, and a melancholy reflec|tion
to think, that Wickedne&s;s &s;hou'd have
got &s;uch root in this Nation, and &s;hould be
&s;o effectually fix'd, that it could not be re|moved,
but at the expence of our Trade,
and the ruin of an infinite number of Peo|ple;
that it is &s;o incorporated with our
<PB N="102" REF="416">
felicity, that like a Limb of the Body an
amputation wou'd endanger the Life.</P>
<P>It is next to Incredible, what a &s;hare the
Luxury of the Age has, in the Employment
of Families, and in the multiplying of Trade&s;|men
in this Nation, among whom no one
article they deal in, may be call'd a nece&s;|&s;ary
to Life, or even to the real comforts
of Life.</P>
<P>The exorbitances of Dre&s;s I have named,
at lea&s;t &s;ome of them; the exce&s;&s;es of Eat|ing
and Drinking I have but ju&s;t named;
but I may be allowed to add, that tho&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es,
as they are more Criminal than tho&s;e
of Dre&s;s and Attire, &s;o they are even in that
exce&s;s become more interwoven with our
publick advantages; and to our great Mis|fortune
be it &s;poken, are &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the
&s;upport of the very Government, as well as of
Commerce, that without the Revenue now
rai&s;ed by them, we can hardly &s;ee how
the publick Affairs could be &s;upported. For
example:
<Q><P>The Wine-trade, as calculated above, pays
the Government in the ordinary cu&s;|toms,
be&s;ides the advantages flowing
from it to the Shipping, the Naviga|tion,
and the employ of Seamen, above
580000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If it &s;hould be &s;omething over
or under, that is not material in &s;o
general a calculation.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="417">
The Malt tax as mention'd above 600000,
&s;ome rate it now, including <HI>Scotland,</HI>
at 700000, but I think it too much.</P>
<P>The Exci&s;e, take it in all its Branches up|on
Liquors, and now including Coffee
and Tea, which may well be call'd
part of our Luxury, I &s;uppo&s;e to be,
1.000000 more or le&s;s,</P>
<P>Together 2.180000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>Ob&s;erve that this is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
nett duties clear of the va&s;t expences of
the Collection, which it is not my bu&s;ine&s;s
to examine here; becau&s;e I am now giv|ing
only the gro&s;s &s;ums of things where|in
there is no nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;trict examina|tion
into &s;maller Circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>But the great enquiry upon the Suppo|&s;ition
of the&s;e Calculations being really true,
or near the truth, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>How many Wines and Brandy wou'd be
imported? how much Malt made, and Beer
brew'd, and Spirits di&s;till'd, and Coffee and
Tea drank; if all Luxury and Intemperance
were laid a&s;ide, if no more of all the&s;e was to
be made u&s;e of, than a due moderation in the
u&s;e of them all required? I do not mean
that the People &s;hou'd be &s;uppo&s;ed to drink
no more Strong-beer or Ale than nece&s;&s;i|ty
required, that they &s;hou'd take Wine
only as Phy&s;ick, and that Canary &s;hou'd be
<PB N="104" REF="418">
&s;old only in the Apothecaries Shops, as was
the ca&s;e in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. time, and in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> al&s;o; and that all of them were
to be u&s;ed no more than was needful
for Health, which by the way wou'd go but
a very little way.</P>
<P>But I wou'd &s;ugge&s;t a moderate temperate
way of drinking only; &s;uppo&s;e it to be &s;uch
as the <HI>Spaniards, Italians</HI> and &s;uch Nations
u&s;e it, that no Drunkenne&s;s, no Extrava|gancies,
no Exce&s;&s;es were practis'd among
us, either among the Poor or the Rich; and
let any one that under&s;tands the general
Con&s;umption of the&s;e Liquors tell me, what
defalcation he thinks wou'd be made in the
revenue from what it is, as things now &s;tand
among us; and whether at lea&s;t a million
and half of that va&s;t Revenue wou'd not
be taken off from the account.</P>
<P>But then, let them tell us al&s;o, what a
dreadful Blow wou'd this Reformation be
to Trade? however nece&s;&s;ary, however call'd
for by Heaven and Earth, however requir'd
for the health both of Soul and Body, that's
not the que&s;tion: But it wou'd be a clap
of Thunder to the Nation: As it wou'd im|mediately
&s;ave above a million of Money,
&s;o it wou'd immediately &s;tarve above a mil|lion
of People.</P>
<P>How many Ale-hou&s;es mu&s;t &s;hut up, how
many Bu&s;hes be taken down, what an ar|my
of Drawers and Tap&s;ters, that &s;cum of
<PB N="105" REF="419">
the Rabble, wou'd immediately go a beg|ging?
what regiments of Gaugers and Ex|ci&s;e-men,
Tide-waiters and Searchers, and
all the Mob of Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e and Exci&s;e
Officers wou'd be disbanded, and left to the
Grave and the Gallows? and what an in|numerable
throng of Women and Children,
the wretched dependants of tho&s;e mi&s;era|bles,
wou'd come to the Pari&s;h for Bread?</P>
<P>And what mu&s;t be done in this ca&s;e? 'tis
a dreadful &s;tory; that's the truth of it; the
Nation's Pro&s;perity is built on the ruin of
the Nation's Morals; their Exce&s;&s;es are the
Exce&s;s of their welfare, and in a Word,
we mu&s;t Preach no more to them Sobriety,
Temperance, and Abatement either of Pride
or Drunkenne&s;s, for if they &s;hou'd reform
they are undone; upon the giving up their
Souls depends the keeping up their Bodies;
and if you put a &s;top to the Exce&s;&s;es of the
Age, as you le&s;&s;en the Revenue, &s;o you ruin
the People; in &s;hort, Virtue would be really,
in the very Letter of it, a SINKING FUND,
for it wou'd in a Word &s;ink the value of ma|ny
of our mo&s;t important Funds; and to
add to it all, it wou'd &s;ink the value of
Lands too: The Con&s;umption of a pro|digious
quantity of the Barley, which is now
u&s;ed, would be le&s;&s;en'd in proportion, and
the Lands which are yearly employ'd to
produce it be uncultivated.</P>
<P>But what a blow wou'd it be to Trade?
<PB N="106" REF="420">
it wou'd take up all the remaining part of this
Work, to give a particular account of the
many Trades and Families of Trade&s;men,
and the poor People depending upon them,
who mu&s;t &s;ink, be without bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;eek
their Bread at other Employments, which
they were not bred to.</P>
<P>What a poor Nation mu&s;t we have been
if we had been a &s;ober, religious, temperate
Nation? How had pre&s;erving our Morals
made us Beggars? unle&s;s the Rich had run
into Exce&s;&s;es and Crimes innumerable,
How mu&s;t innumerable poor have &s;tarv'd?
in a Word, it looks as if we were bound to
be wicked or Poor, and go a &s;otting, or go
a begging; the wealth of the Country is
rais'd by its Wickedne&s;s, and if it &s;hou'd be
reform'd it wou'd be undone.</P>
<P>Nor is this our ca&s;e in our Liquors only,
and in our gaieties of Dre&s;s, but in almo&s;t
every thing el&s;e; particularly in our table
Exce&s;&s;es; the wa&s;t and wantonne&s;s in Eating
is come to &s;uch a height, that it is the &s;up|port
of innumerable People: what a &s;warm
of Gardiners, Poulterers, Pa&s;try-Cooks, Eat|ing-hou&s;es,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are &s;upported by the mere
Extraordinaries of Eating; rai&s;ing Plants by
mere Violence, and as it were a rape upon the
Earth; forcing her to produce things before
her time, and as it were in &s;pite of &s;ea&s;ons,
climates, forward or backward Springs, and
the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate oppo&s;ition of natural
Cau&s;es?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="421">
What Rapes are committed upon nature
in the production of Animals as well as
Plants? making the Ewes bring Lambs all
the Winter, fatting Calves to a mon&s;trous
&s;ize, u&s;ing cruelties and contrary diets to
the poor Brute, to whiten its Fle&s;h for the
Palates of the Ladies, and to gorge the dain|ty
Stomachs of tho&s;e that lay up their feli|city
in Eating fine, as they call it?</P>
<P>It is not my bu&s;ine&s;s here to write a Satyr
upon Luxury, and therefore I go no farther
in my Exclamations again&s;t the&s;e horrible
Exce&s;&s;es: But as my Ob&s;ervations lye an|other
way, I return to the Text. How many
Trades are depending upon the&s;e unhappy
Articles? how many People, Cattle, Acres
of Land, nay whole Countries (almo&s;t) are
employ'd, in furni&s;hing Rarities for the
nice Palates of the&s;e Friends to Luxury?
Should we be reduc'd to moderation in our
diet, and to feed &s;paringly, though whole|&s;ome
too, but not dainty, &s;o as Heaven could
with but one dry or wet Summer bring us
to the nece&s;&s;ity of doing; how many Trade&s;|men
wou'd it be the ruin of? how many
Maid-&s;ervants wou'd it di&s;mi&s;s from their
Places? how many Shops wou'd it &s;hut up?
how many Kitchens wou'd it make half u&s;e|le&s;s?
in a Word, was Eating and Drinking
reduced to things needful only, and to need|ful
quantities too, we &s;hou'd be a mo&s;t mi|&s;erable
Nation as to Trade, I won't &s;ay but
<PB N="108" REF="422">
more of our People wou'd dye good Chri&s;|tians,
and many of them live longer too,
as well as better than they do. But we
&s;hou'd have no more Trade than they have
in <HI>Swedeland</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> comparatively
&s;peaking; and our moderation and temper|ance,
practis'd fir&s;t to reform our manners,
wou'd be &s;oon nece&s;&s;ary to us, for want of
Money to live better.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, Trade is almo&s;t uni|ver&s;ally
founded upon Crime; the few Ar|ticles
which mere nece&s;&s;ity obliges one Na|tion
to purcha&s;e from another, are very
few; they would employ but few Ships,
call for &s;mall Stocks, and but few Mer|chants:
I do not doubt but nece&s;&s;ity was
the fir&s;t foundation of Trade: People tra|vel'd
or &s;ail'd from one Nation to another
to buy and exchange &s;uch Goods only as
they wanted for their needful &s;upply: But
yet finding in remote Countries rarities to
invite the curious, gaieties to tempt the fine,
rich Furrs to clothe the tender and delicate,
and fine Silks to plea&s;e the wanton and
gay world; the&s;e being carried away and
brought to Countries where they receiv'd
Goods equally rare, but perhaps as &s;uper|fluous,
they carried Specimens at fir&s;t to &s;hew
in the Countries they came from, and there
receiv'd orders to fetch over quantities, and
thus we came to have the Silks of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI>
the Sables and Ermins of <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;|covy,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="423">
the Callicoes of <HI>India;</HI> thus the <HI>Per|&s;ians</HI>
and <HI>Armenians</HI> fetch our Woollens,
tho' they have their own Silks: Thus the
toys and trifles, the e&s;&s;ences and perfumes of
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Italians,</HI> the Wine and
Oil of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and all the &s;uperfluities
of the Nations are carried from Place to
Place at a va&s;t Expence, and become the
&s;ubject of Trade, both of Labour and Mo|ney,
and find Employment for millions of
People in all parts almo&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>On this very account, two thirds of the
Navigation of the World is employ'd, to
&s;peak nothing of Land-carriage; let a &s;hort
reflection explain it to your under&s;tanding,
we have in <HI>England</HI> ten thou&s;and &s;ail of
Ships, &s;ome &s;ay twenty thou&s;and, and I
believe they that &s;ay twenty &s;peak neare&s;t
the truth.</P>
<P>Now take out of tho&s;e all the Coal-&s;hips,
Salt-&s;hips, Corn-&s;hips, and &s;uch like coa&s;t|ing
Ve&s;&s;els, which carry nece&s;&s;aries from
one place to another, and for the &s;upply of
this great City in particular, and others in
proportion: Take away the Fi&s;hing Ve&s;|&s;els
al&s;o for the &s;ame Places, and what are
all the re&s;t employ'd in? How at lea&s;t does
the unnece&s;&s;ary mingle with the needful,

our Cravings, and call for more?</P>
<P>In a Word, our Navigation is chiefly em|ploy'd
upon the exorbitances of Life; &s;uch
as we call needful for Trade, but in the
main are not nece&s;&s;ary to the being of Man|kind,
no, nor for their <HI>well being</HI> neither;

but are employ'd in promoting the Luxury
of the World, and are all now thought
extraordinary advantages to the publick, as

Trade is a &s;ufficient defence now, of any
branch of Commerce, however tending di|rectly
to the propagating Vice; like laying

<P><PB N="112" REF="426">
Their Trade is only an exchange of the
more nece&s;&s;ary things of Life, &s;uch as we
&s;ay are required for Food and Raiment;
this Food is far from luxurious fea&s;ting, or
faring diliciou&s;ly, &s;uch as we call fine Eating

to affirm, that if all the Trades of which

were to be taken civilly and quietly out
of the City of <HI>London,</HI> there wou'd be much
fewer People in <HI>London</HI> than there are now
in <HI>Con&s;tantinople:</HI> For Example:</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="427">
The <HI>Turks</HI> have neither Malt or Malt_Liquor:
There at once they abate you all
the Inns, Ale-hou&s;es and Publick Drinking
or Eating-hou&s;es, which are to be &s;een in
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent; and who&s;e
number is &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly great, that &s;hould
it be made publick, Strangers would hardly

the number that depend upon them too,
&s;uch as Malt&s;ters, Malt-makers, Brewers
and their Servants, Tap&s;, ters and all the
namele&s;s crew of Ma&s;ters and Servants,
Hor&s;es, Carriages, Farmers, Ploughmen,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> who all get their Bread by the Drink|ing-trade;
reckoning from the &s;owing the
Barley to the drunken con&s;umer of the Li|quor:
How many thou&s;ands more would
there &s;till be that would have their Bread to
&s;eek, and new Employments to look out for,
if the Drinking of Malt Liquor was to
be taken wholly out of Trade, and the

quarts of Malt every Year, be&s;ides 15000

<P>Bring this to a calculation with the City

<P>Let tho&s;e that con&s;ider <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI>
to be a City containing a million of Peo|ple,

<HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> if all the ways of
living mentioned above were taken away,
and many more that I could name.</P>
<P>Not to &s;ay a word of all the Ships which
are employ'd in bringing the&s;e forbidden,
(out of fa&s;hion) Materials to them, and all
the Trades depending upon the building and
con&s;tant repair of tho&s;e Ships: For Ex|ample:</P>
<P>The
<HI>Turks</HI> have no Collonies in remote
Countries, to bring in va&s;t Fleets yearly, the
Growth of <HI>Virginia, Barbadoes, Jamaica,
New-Spain</HI> and the <HI>Bra&s;ils;</HI> their Tobacco
Grows as it were every where at their own
Doors, they Drink their Coffee without Su|gar,
nature's juices are &s;ufficient to them
without &s;weetning; there at once a va&s;t
throng of <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Merchants with all
<PB N="117" REF="431">
their Ships, the Loading and the Sailors are
quite put out of Employment and voted
u&s;ele&s;s in Trade.</P>
<P>I might go on to di&s;card out of Trade all
the mighty throng of tho&s;e Trades who get
their living here by vanity and dre&s;s; I
mean by the variety and changes of fa&s;hion
in dre&s;s, whether of Men or Women, as
al&s;o for the rich furniture of Hou&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
what numbers of Taylors and Mantua-ma|kers,
Ho&s;iers, Milleners, Semp&s;tre&s;&s;es, Up|hol&s;terers
and in particular Lace-&s;hops and
Linen-drapers mu&s;t we di&s;mi&s;s out of Trade
in this Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>Particularly, and which indeed I &s;hould
have reckoned before, all the Haberda&s;hers
of Hats, and Glovers, all the Hat-makers
and Glove-makers wou'd be di&s;mi&s;s'd at
once, and mo&s;t of the Shoe-makers al&s;o; &s;o
that the &s;poil wou'd fall among the Handi|crafts
al&s;o, as well as among the Trade&s;|men.</P>
<P>But
to avoid dwelling upon things too
long, this great City, I believe, mu&s;t be glad
to di&s;mi&s;s two thirds of its People, and &s;end
them into the Country to 'Till the Land,
and get their Bread as <HI>Adam</HI> did, by the
Sweat of their Brows; where they mu&s;t di&s;|per&s;e
too, and &s;catter up and down, for they
mu&s;t live no more of them in a place, than
the Land could maintain, if they did they
mu&s;t &s;tarve.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="432">
I bring all this home to my fir&s;t argu|ment
thus; <HI>viz.</HI> Trade is propagated by
our crimes, the people &s;upport one another
by their Extravagance and Luxury, their
Gaiety and Pride; Gluttony and Drunken|ne&s;s
a&s;&s;i&s;t to maintain the Nation; the peo|ple
grow rich by the people; they &s;upport
one another; the Taylor, the Draper, the
Mercer, the Coach-maker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and their
Servants, all haunt the Publick-hou&s;es; the
Ma&s;ters to the Taverns, the Servants to the
Ale-hou&s;es, and thus the Vintner and the
Victualler thrive and grow rich. Tho&s;e a|gain
getting before-hand in the World,
mu&s;t have fine Clothes, fine Hou&s;es, and
fine Furniture; their Wives grow gay, as
the Husbands grow rich, and they go to the
Draper, the Mercer, the Taylor, the Up|hol&s;terer,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to buy fine Clothes and nice
Goods; Thus the Draper and Mercer and
Taylor grow rich too, Money begets Mo|ney,
Trade circulates, and the tide of Mo|ney
flows in with it, one hand wa&s;hes the
other hand, and both hands wa&s;h the Face.</P>
<P>Hence we &s;ee the Trade&s;man depends
upon the poor as well as the rich, and all
together makes Trade; which ob&s;ervation
affords a good inference to keep a Trade&s;|man
humble; but of that by it&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this however may be
&s;aid in the behalf or defence of our Com|merce,
as well Foreign as Home Trade, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="433">
that the Trade does not make the Vice,
but the Vice makes the Trade; if the Trade&s;|men
propagate Crimes in the ordinary way
of their bu&s;ine&s;s, the fault is not in the Trade,
but in the Man; as in the care of Drunken|ne&s;s,
the Grape and the Malt is not charg|able,
they are an innocent product, no, nor
are the Wine, the Spirits, the Beer or A$$
guilty; 'tis the exce&s;s, 'tis drinking them
extravagantly, taking an unrea&s;onable quan|tity
loytering away an unrea&s;onable deal of
time, &s;pending their Money and &s;tarving
their Families; the&s;e are the Vices.</P>
<P>Again, Trade, take it in the fir&s;t Per&s;on
of the Trade&s;man, does not introduce the
Luxury, and Extravagance of the people; or
their exorbitant expence in fine Clothes or
fine Equipages, their Pride and O&s;tentation
in either or any of the&s;e: But the Vice is
in the brea&s;t of the vicious; the Pride is in
the in&s;ide of the Beau, while his Embroide|ries,
his Laces, his fine Clothes only flut|ter
in the Wind from the out&s;ide of his
Carca&s;s. Now the Trade&s;man indeed takes
the advantage of the Fop, and puts in to
furni&s;h him with Gaieties, and fine Feathers:
But the Trade&s;man does not bid him turn
Peacock, and &s;trut about to &s;hew and &s;pread
his Plumes.</P>
<P>The Man is a Fool, or Fop, or Beau, the
terms are &s;ynonymous, 'tis much the &s;ame
call him what you will, he comes to the
<PB N="120" REF="434">
Trade&s;man's &s;hop, he buys one toy here, ano|ther
trifle there; he calls for Silver-buttons
in one place, fine Brocade or Cloth of Gold
in another; here he &s;ets an Embroiderer to
Work, there a Lace-maker; he directs
one to make this, another that; in a
word, he &s;catters his Money about as a Far|mer
makes Hay, and when all the&s;e things
are brought together; as <HI>Aaron</HI> ca&s;t the
Earings into the Fire, and out came a Calf;
&s;o the Taylor is &s;ent for, and all the ap|paratus
of his Pride being thrown into his
hands, out comes the Pye-ball'd party-co|lour'd
Beau, compleatly cook'd up and dre&s;s'd
as gay as a Merry-andrew.</P>
<P>All this while 'tis not the Monkey that
plays the Man, but 'tis the Man that plays the
Monkey; 'tis not the Merry-andrew that
acts the Mountebank, 'tis the Mountebank
that acts the Merry-andrew: But &s;till Trade
is in the right of it, to take their Money for
this is a vertue, as it employs a great num|ber
of People; and thus it frequently appears,
that the extravagant pride of the age feeds
Trade, and con&s;equently the Poor.</P>
<P>And what wou'd become of Trade if it
was not thus? The alternative is unhappily
come upon us; we mu&s;t either &s;ell them
fine Clothes, or they will buy abroad, which
is quite contrary to the rea&s;on of Trade:
If fine Silks, rich Brocades, Velvets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are not to be had here, the Beau and the
<PB N="121" REF="435">
fine Lady will &s;end to <HI>France</HI> for them, nay,
they will go to <HI>France</HI> to fetch them, rather
than want them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> do the like, they are forbid
importing our fine Woolen Cloths into
<HI>France;</HI> and their Manufacturers, whatever
they boa&s;t of, cannot make the like there:
And what follows? we &s;ee every Summer
the <HI>French</HI> Beaus make a trip over to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
on purpo&s;e to make new Clothes
and go home again (for they may carry
them ready made.)</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wer'd, we might reduce
the national Pride by &s;umptuary Laws; re|&s;training
the wearing of Embroidery, Silver
and Gold Trimmings, high priz'd Laces, and
the like. Hold there; you may re&s;train their
Extravagance, but you can't promi&s;e to re|&s;train
their Pride; the gay Dre&s;s may be for|bid,
yet the gay temper may remain; &s;o you
ruin your Trade and keep your Vice.</P>
<P>A Man lighted off from his Hor&s;e, to
take a &s;tone out of his Foot, and to ea&s;e
the poor Creature who halted &s;orely; The
ignorant Hor&s;e kick'd him, (perhaps &s;up|po&s;ing
he was going to hurt him, his Foot
being tender) is it &s;o! an&s;wers the Man (and
(lifting his own Foot up) gives the Hor&s;e a
kick, <HI>there's kick for kick,</HI> (&s;ays he) <HI>and
the &s;tone in your Foot &s;till.</HI></P>
<P>All your &s;umptuary Laws do nothing to re|form
the Vice, and yet they injure the Trade
<PB N="122" REF="436">
&s;o, that there's the Trade wounded, the
Trade&s;men ruin'd, and the Crime's in the
Country &s;till.</P>
<P>But to return to the ca&s;e as it is; Trade
takes the benefit of all your Extravagancies,
Trade gains by the Vice, but Trade does
not make the Vice; that would be to make
Trade criminal in its own nature; and no
hone&s;t Man could then be a Trade&s;man, no
religious Man could be a Mercer, or a Lace|man,
or a Taylor, and &s;o of the re&s;t; and
this way indeed it might be &s;aid, as I for|merly
noted, that a Trade&s;man could not
be an hone&s;t Man.</P>
<P>It is mo&s;t certain, that Trade is &s;upported
and enlarg'd, e&s;pecially in this Country, by
many Branches of our exce&s;&s;es and immo|ralities;
and tho' I might &s;et down &s;ome
Expedients here, which might contribute
&s;omething towards an abatement at lea&s;t of
the evil, tho' not to an effectual cure, yet
as I am upon other things in this Work, it
is at pre&s;ent quite out of the way.</P>
<P>Collected bodies of People are al&s;o a par|ticular
a&s;&s;i&s;tance to Trade; and therefore
to have one great and capital City in a
Kingdom, is a very great advantage to
Trade, and much more than if the &s;ame
numbers of People dwelt in &s;everal places.
For example:</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the City of <HI>London</HI> to contain
fifteen hundred thou&s;and People, as they
<PB N="123" REF="437">
tell us it does; I in&s;i&s;t that it is much more
to the advantage of the whole Kingdom,
I mean as to Trade, that it &s;hou'd be &s;o,
than that the &s;ame number of People were
divided equally, and liv'd in fifteen &s;eve|ral
Cities remote from one another.</P>
<P>It is the &s;ame as to Navigation, it is much
better that they have here one command|ing
Port, one noble navigable River, than
that they had in their divided and remote
&s;ituation, as above, fifteen navigable Rivers,
one to every City.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> is a remarkable inf&s;tance of this,
there is there no capital City, the City or
rather Village of <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Court
re&s;ides, is &s;uppo&s;ed to contain 300,000 Peo|ple,
and this is call'd the capital; but it has
neither Sea-port or Inland Navigation, no
Navigable River being near it; the neare&s;t is
the <HI>Tagus</HI> at <HI>Toledo,</HI> which is not only di&s;tant
12 Leagues at lea&s;t, but does not open in|to
the Sea in the &s;ame Dominion, but in
<HI>Portugal;</HI> &s;o that it is no Navigation at all
as to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Spain</HI> has abundance of other Popu|lous
Cities and Sea-ports in it, di&s;per&s;t and
remote from one another, as <HI>Seville, Gra|nada,
Cadiz, Barcelona, Sarago&s;&s;a, Malaga,
Granada, Valentia, Toledo, Cordoua,</HI> and
&s;everal others.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of tho&s;e, <HI>Seville,</HI> has at lea&s;t
300,000 People in it al&s;o, and &s;everal of the
<PB N="124" REF="438">
re&s;t from 100,000 upwards to near 200,000,
at <HI>Cadiz, Barcelona, Malaga, Sarago&s;&s;a,
Valentia, Granada,</HI> which la&s;t City our
be&s;t Geographers reckon to be very near as
Populous as <HI>Seville</HI> or <HI>Madrid;</HI> to &s;um them
up from the the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> way of e&s;timating
Cities, and by the be&s;t accounts, we can
meet with, take them thus.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Madrid</HI> 24000 Families, half of which
are of Nobility and Quality, having
from 20 to 30 and upwards in Family,
the re&s;t being of the ordinary rate.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides e&s;timating the King's Hou&s;hold at
the <HI>Pardo,</HI> which including the ordi|nary
Guards is &s;aid to contain always
12000 Souls. 2. <HI>Seville,</HI> containing
60000 Families at &s;ix in a Hou&s;e 360000
Souls. 3. <HI>Granada,</HI> 50000 Families.
4. <HI>Malaga. 5. Cordoua. 6. Valentia.</HI>
7. <HI>Barcelona. 8. Sarago&s;&s;a. 9. Cadiz.</HI>
10. <HI>Majorca,</HI> each of the&s;e, 15000 Fa|milies,
which with the Poor and the re|ligious
Hou&s;es make far above 100000
in each City.</P></Q>
<P>The rea&s;on of naming the&s;e Cities will
appear pre&s;ently: Put them all together, they
are not &s;uppo&s;ed to contain more People
than the City of <HI>London,</HI> and tho&s;e adja|cent
Towns to <HI>London,</HI> which depend up|on
<PB N="125" REF="439">
their &s;upply of Provi&s;ions from the Ci|ty,
including al&s;o the Ships in the River.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e Cities &s;tand all remote
from one another, and mo&s;t of them in the
mo&s;t rich and fertil &s;oil, on or near the Sea|coa&s;ts,
or on the banks of navigable Rivers,
their &s;upply of Provi&s;ions, Fewel, Clothing,
Equipage, Furniture, and take it of as ma|ny
kinds as you plea&s;e, does neither come
with difficulty, call for multitudes of hands
to be employ'd in rai&s;ing, procuring, fetch|ing
or carrying them, nor does it Influence
the Country to any perceptible degree,
except perhaps for twenty or thirty Miles
round them.</P>
<P>But were all the&s;e Cities, that is to &s;ay,
the number of the Inhabitants included in
them, all join'd in one capital, &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Ma|drid,</HI>
and tho' you were to &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Ma|drid</HI>
had a noble navigable River coming
up to it, &s;uch as the <HI>Tagus,</HI> or the <HI>Ebro,</HI> or
the <HI>Guadalquiver,</HI> 'tis evident, the whole
Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> large and &s;pacious as it is,
for it may be reckon'd almo&s;t 500 Miles
Square, wou'd be engag'd and influenced,
more or le&s;s, in &s;upplying that one City
with Provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>All the Sea-coa&s;ts, and all the Cities and
Ports upon tho&s;e Coa&s;ts wou'd be bu&s;ied, and
Fleets of Ships employ'd to furni&s;h Wine,
Corn, Oil, Fruits, and Foreign Importations of
every kind, all to the capital port of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="440">
All the Inland Provinces wou'd be en|gag'd

<P>All the rich Meadows and Pa&s;tures wou'd

Cattle, to nouri&s;h the Cows, &s;uckle the

di&s;per&s;t and &s;catter'd a few and few together;
and thus as it is in <HI>England,</HI> every Pro|vince
wou'd be providing &s;omething for the
Capital.</P>
<P>Nor is it a ju&s;t objection to &s;ay, the &s;ame
number of People will con&s;ume the &s;ame
quantity of Provi&s;ions in whatever &s;ituation
they may be plac'd; for tho' the quantity
&s;hould be the &s;ame, yet the Influences up|on

tho&s;e Ships and Fleets were to take them
on board?</P>
<P>How is this the cau&s;e of employing a

one another, where the Country within
twenty or thirty Miles round them wou'd be
&s;ufficient for them, and able to &s;upply them,

City the Center of foreign Commerce; here
a great quantity of Goods from all foreign
Countries, are brought in, becau&s;e here is al|ways
a Market, and here they can be con|&s;um'd;
whereas take all the other Ports of
<HI>England,</HI> many of them can &s;end Ships
Loaden out, but few can bring them Load|en
home; for example:</P>

what &s;hall they do with tho&s;e at <HI>Yarmouth?</HI>
they mu&s;t all unlade and deliver their Car|goes

ignorance, e&s;pecially in Trade, are great|ly
mi&s;taken, who pretend the bulk and
growing greatne&s;s of the City is, too much
for the whole Country; alledging that the
Nation is Liver-grown, and mu&s;t dye of a
<HI>Pleura.</HI> The City drawing away the nouri&s;h|ment
from the Country as a drop&s;ie &s;wells
the Body, but draws the nouri&s;hment away
from the extreme parts.</P>
<P>But I &s;ay, this is a mi&s;take; even the &s;imi|le
it&s;elf will not hold; for this &s;welling the
Body of the City makes it the Center of
Nouri&s;hment to the whole Nation; and as
every part of the Kingdom &s;ends up hither
the be&s;t of their Produce, &s;o they carry back
a return of wealth: The Money flows from
the City into the remote&s;t parts, and fur|ni&s;hes
them again to encrea&s;e that Produce,
to improve the Lands, pay Rent to their
Landlords, Taxes to their Governors, and
&s;upply their Families with nece&s;&s;aries; and
this is Trade.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould we know any thing con&s;ider|able
of this Trade if the greatne&s;s of the
City did not cau&s;e it; here the Manufactures
as well as Produce of the &s;everal Countries
<PB N="130" REF="444">
are ama&s;s'd for &s;ale, as well for the circu|lation
of Commerce at home, as the Ex|portation
to Countries abroad.</P>
<P>Here Ships from all parts arrive, and &s;e|veral
of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Branches of
Trade are confin'd to this place by Law:
The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade is all &s;ettled here;
the <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade deliver all here; the
<HI>Italian</HI> Thrown Silk is confin'd to be im|ported
here, and here only, and at no other
Port in <HI>England:</HI> Here the <HI>African</HI> Com|pany
import all their Gold, and the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Company all their Silver; in a Word, 'tis
the great gulph of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Trade, and as
it comes in here, &s;o it goes out again from
hence to all parts of the Nation, circulating
in <HI>Home-Trade</HI> from the Merchant to the
Con&s;umer.</P>
<P>Let us ob&s;erve how this wou'd be in
<HI>Spain,</HI> to go back to the &s;ame reflections as
before; there is lately publi&s;hed, by an Au|thority
that may be depended upon, an ac|count
of the Con&s;umption of Provi&s;ions at
<HI>Madrid;</HI> it is done by way of O&s;tenta|tion,
to &s;hew the greatne&s;s of the place,
and the number of its inhabitants, and a
little to take notice of the plenty of Fle&s;h
eaten in <HI>Spain,</HI> in contradiction to the no|tion
which &s;ome have in this Country, that
they eat more Fle&s;h in <HI>London</HI> in a Month
than they do in all <HI>Spain</HI> in a Year; the
Account is thus.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="445">
Provi&s;ions con&s;um'd for one Year, in the
capital Town of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>500000 Sheep and Goats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12000 Black Cattle or Beeves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6000 Lambs and Kids.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9000 Calves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13000 Swine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>90000 Arobas of Oil.</ITEM>

Gallons and a half.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>56000 Quintals of Bacalco that is Salt
Fi&s;h, each Quintal 113 pound weight.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be acknowleg'd this is a very
con&s;iderable quantity of Provi&s;ions; but I
mu&s;t add, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to gue&s;s at
the numbers of People in <HI>Madrid,</HI> by this
account. On the other hand, take the Com|putation
and compare it with <HI>England,</HI> I
make no doubt, but the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> con|&s;umes
much more, tho' we do not reckon
one third of the People to be in it.</P>
<P>It is true, the Wine and the Oil exceeds
the expence of Wine and Oil in <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI>
but if it be con&s;idered that their Oil is u&s;ed
as we u&s;e Butter, and that Wine or Wa|ter
is the only Liquor they Drink, and that
they have neither Malt-liquor or Cyder; the
Provi&s;ions con&s;um'd at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> will far exceed
<PB N="132" REF="446">
tho&s;e of <HI>Madrid,</HI> tho' <HI>Madrid</HI> is &s;aid to have
near 300000 People, and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> not quite
one.</P>
<P>For &s;et the quantity of Butter, Chee&s;e
and Milk again&s;t their Oil, and the quanti|ty
will be infinitely out-done; and &s;et the
Malt-liquor and Cyder and Wine again&s;t
their Wine alone, the quantity will exceed
in <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and the value much more.</P>
<P>As to the number of Sheep and Lambs,
I &s;uppo&s;e there will be no great difference;
but for the Hogs, Lambs, Calves and black
Cattle, I doubt not but <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> goes greatly
beyond <HI>Madrid,</HI> e&s;pecially the Victualling
their Ships at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> included.</P>
<P>But to bring this back to my Subject;
all the&s;e Provi&s;ions expended at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
what do they do for the Country as to Trade?
Truly they employ the Country very
much, that's certain, and we mu&s;t do ju&s;tice;
and our City of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> does the like: But
how far in the Country does that Employ|ment
extend? How far do they feel the
Influence? perhaps in <HI>Spain</HI> it may go far|ther,
and the Country may be concern'd in
furni&s;hing Corn twenty or thirty Mile, and
Cattle farther, forty or fifty Mile, but after
that you find little or nothing of it.</P>
<P>Thus at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> they carry Corn a great
way indeed, by Water down the Rivers <HI>Se|vern</HI>
and <HI>Avon,</HI> out of <HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hire</HI> and
<HI>Worce&s;ter&s;hire,</HI> and from the Vale of <HI>Eve|&s;ham;</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="447">
likewi&s;e they bring Cyder from <HI>He|reford&s;hire</HI>
down the <HI>Wye, Che&s;hire</HI> Chee&s;e
by the <HI>Severn</HI> out of <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and But|ter
from <HI>South-Wales</HI> by Sea, and &s;o <HI>Bri&s;|tol</HI>
may affect all tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>But their Black Cattle are &s;upplied from
<HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> and their Mutton
and Corn, Chee&s;e and Bacon from <HI>Wilts</HI> and
<HI>Glouce&s;ter&s;hires,</HI> all Counties ju&s;t adjoining;
and after you are gone twenty Miles from
them, even in tho&s;e Counties, you &s;carce find
any mention of the place; I mean of <HI>Bri&s;|tol;</HI>
nay one way there are other Cities and
great Towns that Intercept the Provi&s;ions,
&s;o that very little comes that way, except
Beef; I mean <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire,</HI> where there is
the City of <HI>Wells,</HI> the City of <HI>Bath,</HI> and the
Towns of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and <HI>Froom;</HI> the latter
more Populous than both the two former
put together (tho' Cities) if we may believe
Fame and Travellers.</P>
<P>Thus Trade receives but little influence
from &s;uch places as <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Bri|&s;tol</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> except it be ju&s;t in the ad|jacent
Counties, and within twenty or
thirty Mile of the place.</P>
<P>But bring this back to <HI>London,</HI> and con|&s;ider
the multitudes of People there, and the
exceeding numbers which are gather'd South|ward
into the Counties and Towns for
thirty to forty Miles round <HI>London,</HI> almo&s;t
every way, how all the Country round is
<PB N="134" REF="448">
made populous by the va&s;t run of Bu&s;ine&s;s oc|ca&s;ion'd
by the neighbourhood of the City;
in&s;omuch that 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed if there is a
Million and half of People in <HI>London,</HI> there
is at lea&s;t half a Million more in <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI>
and in tho&s;e parts of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Surrey</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI>
which lye &s;o adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> as to be
within about ten Miles of it; now for the
&s;upply of the&s;e two Millions of People, we
find the whole Kingdom more or le&s;s en|gaged,
and the wheels of Trade are &s;et a
going by it almo&s;t all over the I&s;land.</P>
<P>Nor let us &s;uppo&s;e that the Influence is &s;mall
at the remoter di&s;tances of the Country; but
ju&s;t the contrary, for Multitudes of People
are employ'd in the extreme&s;t parts of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
for the &s;upply of <HI>London,</HI> either with
Food or Fuel, or Manufactures, and that
to a &s;urprizing degree; <HI>for Example:</HI></P>
<P>What a prodigy of Trade does the bare
bringing Coals from the North to <HI>London</HI>
keep up in the Nation? They tell us 30000
People are always employ'd under Ground,
in digging them at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI>
a thou&s;and &s;ail of Ships, or not many fewer,
are employ'd in carrying them, and ten
thou&s;and Seamen, Lightermen, Keelmen
and Boatmen, in the Loading, Carrying
and Unloading the Coals.</P>
<P>Of the Corn Trade I have &s;poken at large,
I refer to it for this part. Take then the But|ter
Trade in <HI>York&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Suffolk;</HI> the
<PB N="135" REF="449">
Chee&s;e Trade in <HI>Wilts, Glouce&s;ter</HI> and <HI>War|wick&s;hire,</HI>
all remote from <HI>London,</HI> and all
employ'd for the &s;upply of <HI>London,</HI> where
(according to the mo&s;t moderate accounts
I have met with) above fifty thou&s;and ton
of Chee&s;e is con&s;um'd in a Year, and as
much Butter; with this difference only, that
the Butter is mo&s;t of it made near <HI>London,</HI>
that is to &s;ay, within 40 to 50 Miles, the
Chee&s;e generally from 70 to 150 Miles.</P>
<P>The multitudes of People concern'd in,
and employ'd by the&s;e things in the mo&s;t
remote parts of the Kingdom, are not to
be conceiv'd, much le&s;s calculated, but by
tho&s;e who under&s;tand the particular Funds
of Provi&s;ions, and the places where they are
made: How many Lands do they cau&s;e to be
cultivated and improv'd, by the va&s;t &s;tocks of
Cows fed on them? How many by the num|bers
of Black Cattle fed in the farthe&s;t parts
of <HI>England,</HI> every way; as in <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> and
<HI>We&s;tmoreland,</HI> the North-riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI>
the Counties of <HI>Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Kent</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex?</HI> &s;uch Bullocks as (by the
way) <HI>Spain</HI> never &s;aw: Again the prodigi|ous
extent of Grounds in the wilder and
remoter Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> one way, and
<HI>Wales</HI> another, and the Mountains of <HI>York|&s;hire</HI>
and <HI>Durham</HI> another; all employ'd
in Breeding, as the other are in Feeding
the &s;tores of Black-Cattle for the Market
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="450">
The like to be &s;aid of the Sheep, which
take up whole Counties and Tracts of Lands
in &s;everal Parts of the Country; as in <HI>Lei|$e&s;ter</HI>
and <HI>Lincoln&s;hire, Northampton</HI> and
<HI>Bucks,</HI> the Bank of <HI>Tees,</HI> and <HI>Rumney-Mar&s;hes</HI>

Numberle&s;s, and all for the &s;upply of <HI>Lon|don.</HI></P>
<P>What an Infinite number of People do
the&s;e employ? What millions of Acres of
Land do they improve? And how do they
create and propagate Trade, even in the re|mote&s;t
Corners of the I&s;land, all mov'd,
&s;upplied, and the Trade &s;upported by the
prodigious Demand of all the&s;e things at the
capital City? Not half of which would be
felt, if the capital City and its adjacent
Multitudes were as I &s;aid above, &s;eparated,
and dwelt in ten or fifteen &s;everal Cities,
remote from one another, and every one
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting as it were by it&s;elf; I &s;ay, though
there wou'd be the &s;ame number of People
to feed, there wou'd not be half the Trade
or Bu&s;ine&s;s occa&s;ion'd to Feed them by.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="451">
The Hurry, the Bu&s;tle, the Throng, that
is to be &s;een here, evidently add to the
Trade; People beget a throng of Bu&s;ine&s;s,
how many Trades does it employ? what
crowds do they call for upon that very oc|ca&s;ion,
which in the divided Circum&s;tances
of things wou'd not be thought of? <HI>For
Example,</HI></P>
<P>What need of Hackney Coaches in &s;mal|ler
Cities, either for the hurry and di&s;patch
of Bu&s;ine&s;s, or for Plea&s;ure; where the num|bers
abate the variety of both. How many
are there at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> at <HI>Exce&s;ter,</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI>
or at <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne? Edinburgh,</HI>
tho' a capital of a Kingdom &s;eparate, and

Term Court of Ju&s;tice, and all the Cere|mony
and nece&s;&s;ary pomp of a Royal City,
had not above ten or twelve Hackney Coach|es,
and no City or other Town in <HI>Bri|tain</HI>
has any at all except <HI>London:</HI> This
therefore wou'd be all laid a&s;ide; &s;o there
would be eight hundred Hackney Coach|men,

other depending People and their Families,
and all the Farmers and Carriages employ'd
to Furni&s;h them with Forage, di&s;mi&s;s'd at

u&s;ele&s;s in the World.</P>
<P>None of the Rivers in <HI>Britain,</HI> except

Per&s;ons about their Bu&s;ine&s;s or Plea|&s;ure
as Pa&s;&s;engers only; nor if the Cities
of <HI>England</HI> were di&s;pers'd as above, would
any of them have occa&s;ion for &s;uch; neither
is it &s;een in the World where Boats ply in
that manner, except the Wherries at <HI>Lon|don,</HI>

<P>There then wou'd be four or five thou&s;and

upon me for making an immoderate Com|putation,
conclude thirty thou&s;and People
immediately dropt out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and all
their Families reduc'd to the utmo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>I take this Propo&s;ition about great Cities,
and the number of People collected toge|ther
making Trade, to agree in &s;ome mea|&s;ure
with what you may ob&s;erve in the
Spring of the Year, from the variety of the
Sea&s;ons; take a time of drought, and when
<PB N="139" REF="453">
the Earth for want of Rain is dry'd, hard
and parch'd up; comes a light flying Shower
and wets the Surface a little, and goes off;
then comes a hot gleam from the Sun, and
licks it up, and by and by comes another
da&s;h of wet, and then more Sun &s;hine, and &s;o
on &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and alternately, &s;everal times
a day, and for a week or a fortnight together.</P>
<P>The&s;e light flying Showers an&s;wer no
end, do little or no Good; the Sun dryes
it up as fa&s;t as it wetted, and (by the long
intervals between) all the benefit is lo&s;t; the
Ground remains hard, &s;teril and barren &s;till,
'tis all one as a drought.</P>
<P>But would the &s;ame quantity of Rain
fall all in one Shower, was there a weight
of Water &s;ufficient to &s;et Nature at Work,
&s;ink down to the Root, and duly moi&s;|ten
the Plants, give drink to the thir&s;ty
Earth, and &s;et the Pri&s;oners free, (I mean
the Seeds which lye bak'd and block'd up
in the Earth, and cannot get out) then the
Earth is refre&s;h'd, and every thing thrives
and flouri&s;hes as it &s;hou'd do.</P>
<P>I think the &s;imile is very ju&s;t; a &s;mall
body of People do nothing, as to this Arti|cle
of Trade; I &s;ay they do nothing; they
do not Influence Trade, even in proporti|on
to their Numbers; like a &s;mall &s;tream of
Water to a Mill, it not only will not make
the Wheel go, at a &s;lower and a propor|tion'd
rate, but it runs by, or under it, goes
<PB N="140" REF="454">
off in wa&s;t, and does not make the Mill <HI>go
at all;</HI> It runs all away to no purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Here a &s;mall City, and there a large
Town, they are good to depend upon the
Capital, and to have the Capital, in ma|ny
things, depend upon them; but they
are not able to &s;ub&s;titute a Capital, and to
&s;tand in the room of it; when they come
to have the general Body, the whole Na|tion's
Trade depend upon them, in&s;tead of
a capital City, then they are nothing at all,
they are of no Importance.</P>
<P>They tell us <HI>France</HI> is &s;o &s;ituated by the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of navigable Rivers, that there
are two and forty large Cities, which have
all a Communication with the great City
of <HI>Paris</HI> by Water, either by Sea or River
Navigation; and what is the con&s;equence?
Not that the&s;e Cities make <HI>Paris</HI> great
and Rich, but that all the&s;e Cities are made
rich and great by the City of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;ay the &s;ame of <HI>London,</HI> tho' not as to
River Navigation; but the whole Kingdom
of <HI>England</HI> by its Communication with
<HI>London,</HI> is the &s;ame; it is not the Kingdom
makes <HI>London</HI> rich, but the City of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
makes all the Kingdom rich.</P>
<P>The Country corre&s;ponds with the City,
but the City corre&s;ponds with all the World;
the Country &s;upplies the City with Corn
and Cattle, that is to &s;ay, with Provi&s;ions;
yes, and if there was not &s;uch a City to
<PB N="141" REF="455">
take off and con&s;ume them, what wou'd the
Country do? How mu&s;t the product of the
Land be &s;old? how the Rent paid? the Land
mu&s;t lye wa&s;t and uncultivated, the Cattle
would run Wild, and devour the Country,
or be &s;tarv'd and dye: The Country &s;ends
up their Corn, their Malt, their Cattle,
their Fowls, their Coals, their Fi&s;h all to
<HI>London;</HI> and <HI>London</HI> &s;ends back Spice, Su|gar,
Wine, Druggs, Cotton, Linen, To|bacco,
and all foreign nece&s;&s;aries to the
Country; and above all the re&s;t that u&s;eful
drug call'd <HI>Money;</HI> &s;o that &s;till 'tis the capi|tal
City that is the life of the Country,
and keeps them all in motion.</P>
<P>Again, the Countrymen &s;heer their Sheep,
&s;ell their Wool, carry it from Place to Place;
the Manufacturers &s;et it to work, to Comb|ing,
Carding, Spining, Winding, Twi&s;ting,
Dying, Weaving, Fulling, Dre&s;&s;ing, and thus
they fini&s;h their numberle&s;s Manufactures;
But what mu&s;t they do with them, what
could a <HI>Madrid,</HI> or a <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> do for them?
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> could take off &s;ome, indeed, and does
export a Proportion with its Neighbours;
but <HI>London</HI> is the Center of the gro&s;s body
of Manufacture, <HI>London</HI> an&s;wers the end
of every Trade Abroad, and of every Ma|nufacture
at Home; be it <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> for
Cotton-ware, <HI>York&s;hire</HI> for coar&s;e Cloth,
Ker&s;ies, <HI>&amp;c. Wilts</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> for fine
Cloths, <HI>Norwich</HI> for Stuffs, <HI>Wales</HI> for
<PB N="142" REF="456">
Flannels, all goes to <HI>London,</HI> and all have
their Money in return from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>London</HI> con&s;umes all, circulates all, ex|ports
all, and at la&s;t pays for all, and this
is Trade; this greatne&s;s and wealth of the

every kind in the Country, and in every part
of the Country.</P>
<P>It may be thought a little a&s;&s;uming to &s;ay,
the City &s;upports the Trade&s;men of the
Country, but the fact is plain; you cannot
go to a Shopkeeper of any Note in the re|mote&s;t
Town in <HI>England,</HI> but he holds
&s;ome corre&s;pondence at <HI>London;</HI> or el&s;e
he mu&s;t be a mean Trade&s;man, that buys
his Goods of &s;ome of his better furni&s;h'd
Neighbours, and they buy at <HI>London;</HI> &s;o
that the other may be &s;aid to buy at <HI>Lon|don</HI>
too, only he does it at &s;econd Hand.</P>
<P>Nor is this all; but, as all the&s;e Country
Trade&s;men buy at <HI>London,</HI> &s;o they all are
in debt at <HI>London</HI> more or le&s;s; they all
owe the <HI>London</HI> Shopkeepers Money; &s;o
that the whole Country may in &s;ome re|&s;pects
be &s;aid to Trade upon the City's &s;tock,
the <HI>London</HI> Trade&s;men giving them all Cre|dit.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="457">
It is indeed a little remote from the &s;ub|ject
of inland Trade, or el&s;e 'tis very remark|able
and worth our ob&s;erving, that the Ci|ty
of <HI>London</HI> Trades with &s;uch an immen&s;e
Stock, that it may be &s;aid they give Cre|dit
to all the World; all the Trades they
carry on Abroad, almo&s;t in every part of
the World, are carried on by the &s;trength
of their Stocks; They do not receive
the Goods from Abroad, and &s;o make the
returns back to the &s;everal Countries from
whence they come; but they &s;end their own
Goods fir&s;t out, and receive the Goods of
other Counries back in payment.</P>
<P>Thus in all the Ports of <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> the Merchants of <HI>Lon|don</HI>
have their Hou&s;es (as they call them)
there; the Warehou&s;es are pil'd full up to
the Ceilings with <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Bales; <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
Stocks carry on the Trade; in a word,
we give Credit to all the World.</P>
<P>Not a Fleet of <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Ships from the
<HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> not the Galleons of Flota from <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
but the Gold of the fir&s;t, and the Sil|ver
of the la&s;t, or at lea&s;t a great &s;hare of
it, is the product of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stocks, and
belongs to <HI>London</HI> Merchants, who&s;e
Goods &s;old upon Credit at <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Ca|diz,</HI>
went fir&s;t out to <HI>America</HI> to purcha&s;e
that Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>Not a <HI>Turkey</HI> Fleet, or a Ship from <HI>Leg|horn,

<PB N="144" REF="458">
frieghted with the fine&s;t raw and Thrown
Silk, the choice&s;t Druggs and Gums, but
'tis all the Effects of the Merchants of <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
and in return for Credit fir&s;t given by
the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It is the like in the Plantation Trade, all
the <HI>New-England</HI> Trade, the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Trade,
the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Trade, 'tis all carried on by
the Stocks of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>The Sugars, the Tobacco's, the Furrs, the
Turpentine, the Cocoa, the Indigo, and all
the re&s;t of the Produce of our Colonies,
it comes Home in return from all tho&s;e
I&s;lands for the Goods long before con&s;ign'd
to them from <HI>London;</HI> &s;o that in a Word
almo&s;t all the Plantations are managed up|on
the Stocks and Sub&s;tance of the Citi|zens
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>To bring it all back to what I ob&s;erv'd
before; as this va&s;t corre&s;pondence Abroad
is thus carried on by the City of <HI>London</HI>
upon its own Stock, and they give Credit
to all the World; &s;o when tho&s;e returns
come back, they di&s;per&s;e all tho&s;e Goods
again among the Country Trade&s;men, and
give them Credit too; and this is the Effect
of a capital City: A capital City carries
on a capital Trade, and enriches, and em|ploys
the whole Country, which if the
&s;ame People dwelt in a divided and &s;e|parate
Capacity, wou'd not be the Ca&s;e
at all.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="459">
So many Deductions mu&s;t be made from
the Home Trade, that thou&s;ands, nay hun|dreds
of thou&s;ands of People now employ'd
in Collecting the Commerce thus to one
place, would then be left without Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and by con&s;equence without Bread; as in
the Country, if the Sheep fed all about the
Farmers Hou&s;es as the Swine do, or were
Dome&s;ticks like their Dogs, and not in
Flocks, requiring to be tended and direct|ed,
there wou'd be no employ for all the
Shepherds, which in the We&s;t and Northern
parts of <HI>England</HI> are maintain'd by keep|ing,
and waiting upon, and folding them;
&s;o the nece&s;&s;ary Attendance upon the Trade,
as it all goes up to, and comes back from <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
how many thou&s;ands of People does
it Employ?</P>
<P>It is ordinarily &s;aid, that there are 30000
Higglers, and Travelling Market Folks, as
we call them, about this City, a poor &s;ort
of People that are wholly employ'd to
bring Butter, Eggs, Pigeons, Fowls, Chic|kens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to <HI>London</HI> Market, and bring
Veal and Pork, and &s;maller things up and
down, from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, and every one
of them have a Hor&s;e, &s;ome more, &s;ome
Carts; &s;ome of them come forty or fifty
Miles; the&s;e wou'd be all out of Bu&s;ine&s;s,
except only &s;uch as lived within four, or
five, or &s;ix Miles of the Place.</P>
<P>The like of Gardiners, who&s;e numbers
are now, within a few Years, &s;o prodigiou&s;|ly
<PB N="146" REF="460">
encrea&s;ed, and who now keep Carts and
whole Teams of Hor&s;es, or large Luggage
Boats upon the River, and Employ an In|credible
quantity of Land for ten Miles
di&s;tance round the City; whereas were it a
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> or an <HI>Exce&s;ter,</HI> no &s;uch thing wou'd
be remov'd above a Mile from the place,
nor &s;o many Hor&s;es and Servants be em|ploy'd
by nineteen in twenty.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the Benefits of a ca|pital
City, as to Trade: I might give a great
many Examples, of other Advantages, which
a conflux of People nece&s;&s;arily bring with
it; but it is enough, the Magnitude of the
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> inland Commerce is a Te&s;timony
of it; the Influence of the City upon it all
has evidently been not the &s;upport only,
but the very Birth and Foundation of the
Trade it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>London</HI> is &s;uch a Fund of
Commerce, as indeed cannot be de&s;crib'd in
a narrow compa&s;s; the Trade&s;men of it,
however degenerated, and whatever deficien|cies
may be found in their Conduct as &s;uch,
yet it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, they carry on
as great a Trade as ever, and perhaps a
greater, nor can it be di&s;puted, but that their
Trade encrea&s;es every Day.</P>
<P>It may indeed be true, that the encrea&s;e
of Crime is the encrea&s;e of Commerce,
and the Wickedne&s;s of the time is the
Ble&s;&s;ing of the Trade; the Vanity, the
<PB N="147" REF="461">
Luxury, the Folly, and even the Vice of the
People is the cau&s;e of that encrea&s;e, or at
lea&s;t, part of it, <HI>as I have &s;aid already;</HI> but
the fact is &s;till true, that the Trade is en|creas'd,
and that in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner;
as to the Error of it, that is not our pre&s;ent
Bu&s;ine&s;s, the morality of the Trade&s;men's
Conduct upon that account is indeed an
Article by it &s;elf, and I &s;hall take &s;ome No|tice
of it in our next Chapter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of &s;uch Trade&s;men who by the nece&s;|&s;ary
Con&s;equences of their Bu&s;ine&s;s
are oblig'd to be acce&s;&s;ary to the
Propagation of Vice, and the En|crea&s;e
of the Wickedne&s;s of the
Times, and that all the Immorality
of the Age is not occa&s;ion'd by the
Ale-hou&s;es and the Taverns.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a very melancholy Reflection, for
an hone&s;t Trade&s;men to make, that by
the Con&s;equence of his Trade, which is his
lawful Calling, he may be a Tool in the
hand of the Devil to prompt and propagate
the Vice, and encrea&s;ing immoralities of the
Times, and of the Country where he lives.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may think now, I am go|ing
<PB N="148" REF="462">
to run out here in a long Exclamation
again&s;t the &s;everal Profe&s;&s;ions or Trades,
which are made In&s;truments of Crime; as
Alehou&s;e-Keepers, Tavern-Keepers, and &s;uch
like People, who&s;e Hou&s;es are too often the
receptacles and retreats of Lewdne&s;s and
Gaming, as well as Drunkenne&s;s, and other
Exce&s;&s;es; and to reproach them with their
Profe&s;&s;ions as &s;uch: But you will be Mi&s;|taken;
a Vintner or a Victualler may, if he
plea&s;es, keep as regular a Hou&s;e, and as good
order in it, as any other Man; &s;o that it
is not his Profe&s;&s;ion that is the cau&s;e of
the Scandal; but if he does not, at lea&s;t as
far as his own Government extends (and
I cannot &s;ay he is an&s;werable for any more)
the Man is the Criminal, not the Trade, and
I &s;hall explain my &s;elf more particularly pre|&s;ently.</P>
<P>But
the Sumptuary Trades, on the other
hand, cannot do this; and &s;uch of them
who&s;e whole Employ has a natural and di|rect
tendency to the Propagation of our Ex|ce&s;&s;es
of &s;everal &s;orts, the&s;e are of another
nature; and there the Trade&s;man is natu|rally
the very immediate In&s;trument in the
Vice, the In&s;tigator, I may &s;ay, the Tempter.</P>
<P>And what &s;hall we &s;ay, while we are
come to an Age, when, as I hinted ju&s;t now,
the national Vices are become Virtues in
Trade, and the flouri&s;hing of &s;o many
thou&s;and Shop-Keepers, &s;o many rich Ma|nufacturers,
<PB N="149" REF="463">
and the Employment of &s;o
many millions of poor People is the mere
Effect of abominable Luxury and Pride;
&s;uch as that of Dre&s;s, of Furniture; of change
of Fa&s;hion, of delicacies in Dyet, Eat|ing,
Drinking, and the like.</P>
<P>Every Taylor invents Fa&s;hions, the Mer|cer
&s;tudies new Patterns, the Weaver forms
them into beautiful and gay Figures, and
&s;tores him&s;elf with a va&s;t variety to allure
the fancy; the Coach-maker contrives new
Machines, Chairs, Berlins, Flyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all to
prompt the Whim$ies, and unaccounta|ble
Pride of the Gentry, and draw them or
lead them into uncommon Extravagancies;
changing their Equipages as often as fancy,
not nece&s;&s;ity directs.</P>
<P>The Upholder does the like in Furniture,
till he draws the gay Ladies to &s;uch an Ex|ce&s;s
of Folly, that they mu&s;t have their
Hou&s;es new furni&s;h'd every Year; every
thing that has been longer than a Year in
u&s;e mu&s;t be call'd old, and to have their
fine Lodgings &s;een by Per&s;ons of any Fi|gure
above twice over, looks ordinary and
mean.</P>
<P>It wou'd take up a Book of it&s;elf to give
a due Mea&s;ure of Satyr to the &s;urprizing
folly of our People, e&s;pecially the Gentry,
who, as if their E&s;tates were too great, and
that they knew not which way to di&s;po&s;e
of their Money fa&s;t enough, &s;uffer the Trade&s;|men,
<PB N="150" REF="464">
as above, to guide their Vanity by the
artifice of Words, making them di&s;like their
riche&s;t Clothes, Equipages and Furniture,
fancying them out of Fa&s;hion, and not fit to
be &s;een, only that the Upholder, the Coach|maker,
or the Taylor may furni&s;h new, and
be paid for it.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Ca&s;e is not directed to the
Ladies and Beaus who are thus wheedl'd and
drawn in, or to the folly of the Times, in be|ing
&s;ubject to be &s;o ridiculou&s;ly impos'd up|on,
but to the Trade&s;men who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts
upon the Practice of &s;uch Arts, at lea&s;t the
&s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity of their Bu&s;ine&s;s often
depend upon it.</P>
<P>As the Vanities of the People encrea&s;e
Trade, &s;o the Craft of the&s;e Trade&s;men en|crea&s;e
the Vanity of the People; I mu&s;t re|fer
it to Principle, if upon &s;edate Reflecti|on
it can be reconcil'd to their Thoughts,
if it &s;its ea&s;ie upon their Con&s;ciences, they
mu&s;t go on; but I wou'd recommend it to
&s;uch Trade&s;men to act with &s;ome Caution
in the&s;e Ca&s;es, with re&s;pect to the Days of
reflection which may be perhaps a great way
off, but will certainly come.</P>
<P>There is a ju&s;t Impartiality which a
Trade&s;man may ob&s;erve between his In|tere&s;t
and his Cu&s;tomer; if the Buyer comes
and directs him to make this or that parti|cular
thing, of &s;uch and &s;uch materials, and
in &s;uch and &s;uch a form, it is his Bu&s;ine&s;s to
<PB N="151" REF="465">
perform it, and the Extravagance is indeed
the Fop's that Impo&s;es it upon him.</P>
<P>But we have &s;ome Trade&s;men who rack
Invention to bring &s;omething into the
World more than ordinarily whim&s;ical and
extravagant, to allure and fall in with the
mo&s;t &s;tupid and ea&s;ily abus'd humour of the
Time; if this takes, that Man values him|&s;elf
upon being the Inventor of this new
thing; if po&s;&s;ible gets it call'd by his own
Name, and the Town runs after it, in the
exce&s;s of their Folly, even to di&s;traction.</P>
<P>This Man values him&s;elf upon it, gets
a fame by it that an&s;wers his end in Trade,
and brings a profit inexpre&s;&s;ible; then he
&s;ets up for a <HI>Fa&s;hion-Monger,</HI> and then the
meane&s;t things go down with the fancy of
the abu&s;ed People only upon the name of
the Man. Such was the <HI>Doyly</HI> Stuffs, well
known in the Town &s;ome Years ago, and
which tho' a trifle in it&s;elf, yet &s;et the Beaus
a dre&s;&s;ing in the meane&s;t and mo&s;t fooli&s;h
tra&s;h, and which was neither more or le&s;s
than the gro&s;&s;e&s;t piece of Impo&s;ition of its
kind that ever went down with the Town.</P>
<P>It may be true, that this was no Exam|ple
of Vice indeed, but of Folly, and that
the&s;e Follies create Trade; but the Exce&s;&s;es
mentioned above, carry the&s;e Follies to a
greater height, even till they become Cri|minal
to the Families concern'd in them,
while the Per&s;ons run in Debt for their Gaie|ty,
<PB N="152" REF="466">
and wound their E&s;tates to make a &s;hew
in their Hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Here the fine tall Oaks, nay Woods of
them are fell'd to rai&s;e the Equipage of the
Family, and the Fields are &s;tript without
Doors to line the Man&s;ion Hou&s;e within:
In a Word, the Children are &s;tarv'd to be
made Gay, made Beggars to be fine, and poor
only to look as if they were rich; if the
Woods cea&s;e to &s;upply, they Borrow, Mort|gage,
run in Debt, and at la&s;t go a begging
too, for the plea&s;ure of going fine; and if
the Luxury of the pre&s;ent Age does not fill
the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> Pri&s;ons with Ba|ronets,
and E&s;quires, the Court with Cham|bermaids
of Quality, and the Army with
elde&s;t Sons in&s;tead of younger Brothers, it
mu&s;t be prevented by &s;ome Extraordinary
Change of Management in the World,
which in an Age where Reformation is &s;o
much out of Fa&s;hion can hardly be expected.</P>
<P>Now this is the way of Living that makes
Trade, which by the way is the only good
it can be &s;aid to do; but how the Trade&s;|men
who propagate this in order to form
their private Intere&s;t, can ju&s;tify that Prac|tice
to their own Principles, or can pretend
to have any pretences to Principles, that
Merits to be con&s;idered.</P>
<P>This I mu&s;t acknowledge is in my Opi|nion
a much wor&s;e Article in, and has a far
greater tendency to debauching the Morals
<PB N="153" REF="467">
of the People, than the Ale-hou&s;e and the
Brandy-&s;hop; for the Luxury of the rich is,
in my Opinion, much wor&s;e than the Drunk|enne&s;s
of the Poor; and has a Tendency to
much wor&s;e things, which I could make out
at large, but that is not my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>But it Propagates Trade, and that is my
&s;ubject: Pray let us examine a little into
the manner, and &s;ome of the Con&s;equences
of this, I mean in Trade, for that is the Point.</P>
<P>'Tis True, the growing Wealth of the
Town, and the Gaiety of Dre&s;s have advanc|ed
the Silk Manufacture to a prodigy, in
which the Improvement of Fancy runs on
to bear a &s;hare: The Weaver's Art is &s;o
encouraged by this, that now we make at
home all the fine Broad-&s;ilks, Velvets, Bro|cades,
Damasks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which formerly came
from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> Above twelve hun|dred
thou&s;and pounds a Year, which by the
&s;tricte&s;t Calculation was formerly paid to the
<HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;e, &amp;c.</HI> for wrought
Silks, is now all kept at Home, and ex|pended
among our own Poor; &s;o far the
effect in Trade is very good.</P>
<P>But ob&s;erve the difficulty upon the Trade&s;|men,
the known humour of the Peo|ple
of this Nation, (more perhaps than of
any other in the World,) is to de&s;pi&s;e the
Growth or Product of their own Country,
and give the mo&s;t Extravagant Prices for
Foreign Manufactures, whether better in
<PB N="154" REF="468">
kind or not: Now what's the con&s;equence
of this, the Mercers find out the &s;oft place,
the Ladies will allow nothing but <HI>French</HI>
to be fit for a Per&s;on of Quality to wear;
if you offer them the riche&s;t Silk, the mo&s;t
beautiful Pattern, the mo&s;t agreeable Co|lours,
if it has the Scandal of being <HI>Eng|li&s;h,</HI>
it mu&s;t not have the honour to come
upon their Backs, there's the original Vice:
'Tis founded in humour.</P>
<P>The Mercer has two or three ingenious
Workmen, Ma&s;ter Weavers in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI>
who are Men of exqui&s;ite Art, clean
Heads, and bright Fancies in their Bu&s;ine&s;s;
the&s;e Men &s;o far outdo the <HI>French,</HI> that
nothing comes from <HI>France</HI> equal to what
they perform here.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> Thus far the Trade is improv'd,
and the Silk Manufacture in <HI>England</HI>
nobly advanc'd; and this Trade might
perhaps be carry'd on without Crime,
as much as any Trade that relates to
dre&s;s and the gaiety of Apparel.</Q>
<P>But the Mercer finding how the hu|mour
of the Town goes, he &s;ets the&s;e
skilful Arti&s;ts to Work, and to rack their
Invention for new out-of-the-way Fancies
and Patterns of Silks, &s;uch (to be &s;ure) as
have not been &s;een in the Town before;
the Workman&s;hip is exqui&s;itely good, the
<PB N="155" REF="469">
Silk rich and weighty, the Brocades thick
and high, and the Patterns flaming in Fan|cy;
the&s;e the Mercer keeps in Petto, and
when the Ladies have with di&s;dain look'd
upon all the fine Things a well furni&s;h'd
Shop can produce, and are as it were ju&s;t
going out of his Door, the cunning Trade&s;|man,
well furni&s;h'd with a Stock in his Face,
as well as in his Shop, an oyly Tongue and
a ca&s;e-harden'd Con&s;cience, takes the Ladies
to one Corner of the Shop, and whi&s;per|ing,
as if he was afraid any one &s;hou'd hear
what he de&s;ired every one &s;hou'd know,
he makes 'em this formal Speech with the
utmo&s;t A&s;&s;urance, and not one Word of
Truth in it.</P>
<Q><P>&startq;Madam, &s;ays he, I can indeed &s;hew
you &s;ome very fine <HI>French</HI> Silks, but
your Lady&s;hip knows there is &s;ome
hazard in that part of our Bu&s;ine&s;s,
and we dare not &s;hew them publickly
in our Shop; be&s;ides, very few Ladies
will go to the Price of them: But I
dare &s;o far depend upon your Lady|&s;hip's
Honour, that you will not do me
any Injury if you &s;hou'd not Buy.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> With this he Invites them into
an Inner-&s;hop, or perhaps up Stairs in|to
his dining Room, and there he
goes on with the Cheat.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> 'Tis to be ob&s;erv'd al&s;o, that 'tis
<PB N="156" REF="470">
an original fal&s;hood in Fact; for the
<HI>French</HI> Silks are by him &s;uppo&s;ed to be
run, or as we call it &s;muggled; that is,
got on &s;hore without paying Duties;
&s;o that he is liable to be inform'd
again&s;t, and have the Goods &s;eized;
whereas the Goods come no more
from <HI>France,</HI> than the Mercer.</P></Q>
<P>The Ladies taken with this Bite, and per|fectly
drawn into the &s;nare, follow the Mer|cer
into his retreat, and there he produces
the Extraordinaries he pretends to; the La|dies
are &s;urpriz'd with the Silks, that's the
fir&s;t Article; for they are really fine, rich,
new, charming in every re&s;pect, and well
worth their not liking only, but admiring.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t que&s;tion the Ladies ask is, if they
are really <HI>French,</HI> the Mercer makes no
&s;cruple to affirm they are, and perhaps
&s;wears to it: But fails not to add another
black Article, <HI>Yes,</HI> Madam, <HI>French!</HI> your
Lady&s;hip may depend upon it, <HI>they are
French; we can make no &s;uch Things as the&s;e
in England.</HI> There are two direct fal&s;hoods
by way of Preliminary, be&s;ides laying a &s;can|dal
upon his Country, as if we were not
able to come up to the <HI>French,</HI> or any o|ther
Nation in the Perfection of the Ma|nufacture;
whereas 'tis known we go be|yond
them in every branch of the Trade,
<PB N="157" REF="471">
and in every particular Article of the Per|formance.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for the grand Cheat
is behind, and 'tis not a Cheat only, but 'tis
a complicated fraud; dre&s;s'd, and &s;et out with
&s;o many downright fal&s;hoods, that 'tis like
a Silver Watch gilded, and then &s;et out with
fal&s;e Diamonds, &s;o that no Body but a Per|&s;on
well skill'd in the Fraud can perceive
the Cheat.</P>
<P>The next thing the Lady asks is the Price;
the cunning Trade&s;man &s;miles, &s;hakes his
Head, and with a world of Grimace tells
her, indeed, Madam, I am almo&s;t afraid to
tell your Lady&s;hip the Price: But 'tis what
we can't help; the&s;e things will be always
dear, becau&s;e they are &s;o difficult to be had,
and &s;o much hazard attends it; Indeed, Ma|dam,
I cannot &s;ay they are cheap; and then
he &s;tops, and takes Breath a little; not that
the matter of what he has &s;aid, which has
not a word of Truth in it, is in any danger
of being di&s;cover'd, or as we &s;ay, in like
ca&s;es, that a L&mdash;would choak him, or en|danger
his Lungs: But to give the Lady
time to &s;wallow and dige&s;t the gro&s;s things
already &s;aid to her.</P>
<P>Well, &s;ays the Lady, but let's hear it how|ever,
let's know the Price; upon which ha|ving
prepar'd her for the extravagant de|mand,
he asks her 35 <HI>s.</HI> a Yard, with an
A&s;&s;urance not to be de&s;crib'd, tho' cover'd
<PB N="158" REF="472">
at fir&s;t, and dre&s;s'd up with the Appearance
of all po&s;&s;ible &s;incerity and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>The Price thus broke, the Lady &s;tarts a
little at it at fir&s;t, but is drawn in gradual|ly
to it, by the Repetition of all tho&s;e Trad|ing
L&mdash;s we mentioned before; and be|ing
a&s;&s;ured by the Mercer, that it is a right
<HI>French</HI> Silk, and was brought over from
<HI>France</HI> with a great deal of difficulty and
hazard, &s;he comes up to his Price within a|bout
half a Crown a Yard; &s;o he &s;ells her
the Silk as a va&s;t favour, a great Penny|worth,
lays a great Obligation upon her
Lady&s;hip for the particular re&s;pect &s;hewn her
in venturing to &s;hew it her at all; and claims
an Intere&s;t in her favour for her &s;elf and
her friends, for their future coming to his
Shop.</P>
<P>And now after all this Grimace, as I
think it may be ju&s;tly call'd, here are three
or four things in it worth our Notice.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Here is a &s;tated e&s;tabli&s;hed form of
Cheating and Fal&s;hood, &s;et up as a Rule
of Trade, and what the Mercer re&s;olves
upon as a Practice in the Cour&s;e of
his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Here is a fatal national folly encourag|ed,
and in its own Imagination grati|fied
too; tho' the Per&s;on is deceiv'd,
and mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly impo&s;ed upon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is a mo&s;t immoderate gain made
<PB N="159" REF="473">
by the Fraud, which indeed is the
grand Incentive and Provokative to
the Crime.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Here is general Trade propagated by a
double Crime; <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> again&s;t Man
in the fooli&s;h depre&s;&s;ing a u&s;eful home
Manufacture, di&s;couraging Trade, de|priving
the Poor of our own Coun|try,
and affecting the Labours of Fo|reigners;
<HI>and the &s;econd,</HI> again&s;t Truth,
and the Author of Truth; in pu&s;hing
on Bu&s;ine&s;s at the expence of our Mo|rals,
and with a Chain of accumulat|ed
Fal&s;hood and Prevarication.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>What can the Trade&s;men &s;ay for this?
who wou'd be a rich Man at this Price,
and how do the&s;e things give Life to the
general Scandal upon Bu&s;ine&s;s, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
a Trade&s;man cannot be an hone&s;t Man?
The Mercer makes his Market by the Fraud,
that's true; he &s;ells this Silk for 32 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI>
a Yard, which he could very well afford,
for 18 to 20, or 22 <HI>s.</HI> and gain an hone&s;t
Profit too.</P>
<P>Now what mu&s;t we &s;ay to tho&s;e Trade&s;|men,
who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to lay them
under the nece&s;&s;ity of this way of acting;
how do they, as I &s;aid above, not only
prompt and draw People on in the popular
Vice of <HI>over gay Dre&s;s,</HI> and Exce&s;&s;es in ha|bit,
but pro&s;titute Principle to propagate
<PB N="160" REF="474">
Crime, and &s;acrifice Con&s;cience to &s;upport
the Luxurious Temper? for Exce&s;s of Orna|ment
is a Luxury in Habit, as well as Eat|ing
and Drinking.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be hard to per&s;uade the
Trade&s;men that this is a Crime, and could
it be ab&s;tracted from the plain Cheat, and
the black addenda of Fal&s;hood and L&mdash;ing,
it would be &s;till more difficult; but as the
Offences cannot be &s;eparated, &s;o the re|proach
cannot be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>But what mu&s;t be done? whatever Manu|facture
is di&s;courag'd, the Manufacture of
Cheating ought not to be encourag'd to
prevent it: If Trade cannot be carried on
without &s;ending the Trade&s;men to the <HI>De|vil,</HI>
the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hou'd come and open Shop
him&s;elf, rather than any hone&s;t Men &s;hou'd
Trade for him, as the&s;e do, and at &s;uch a
price, rai&s;e their Fortunes under his Con|duct;
for indeed in &s;uch Ca&s;es, 'tis little bet|ter
than the <HI>Devil</HI> driving the Trade, and
the Trade&s;men's being the <HI>Devils</HI> Journey|men;
they certainly carry on the Trade for
him, and he pays them board Wages; thus
the Trade&s;men get the Money, and the
<HI>Devil</HI> gets the Trade&s;men.</P>
<P>On the other hand, wou'd the Mer|cer
act the hone&s;t Part, that is, fir&s;t be hone&s;t
to their Country, and to the Manufucture
wrought at Home, as in one re&s;pect, they
really ought to do, and propagate our own
<PB N="161" REF="475">
Manufactures with their utmo&s;t Endeavour,
refu&s;ing Univer&s;ally to &s;ell any <HI>French</HI> or
Foreign Silks, which really and <HI>Bona fide</HI>
there is no manner of need of; and wou'd
they at the &s;ame time tell the Ladies plain|ly,
that <HI>France</HI> cannot furni&s;h any thing fi|ner,
richer, more beautiful, or more agree|able
than is made by our own Weavers,
and that all the&s;e charming Patterns, fine Co|lours,
rich Brocades, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made at Home
and are inimitable from Abroad as is mo&s;t
true.</P>
<P>Wou'd they do thus, I &s;ay, as hone&s;t Deal|ings
claim they &s;hou'd do, they would effec|tually
&s;uppre&s;s the fooli&s;h humour of de|&s;pi&s;ing
our own Manufacture, which is &s;o
general among the People, and in a little
time our own Weavers wou'd advance their
Improvements to &s;uch a Degree, as to &s;end
their wrought Silks Abroad, even to <HI>France</HI>
it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I come now to mention the turn which
the Luxury of our People has given to Trade
in &s;ome other particulars, which will lead
the Trade&s;men to the like ju&s;t Reflections.</P>
<P>The Face of Trade has its new turns in
the Heads of the People, within the&s;e few
Years to &s;uch a Degree, that it is worth our
Reflections, and we may draw many u&s;eful
Inferences from it, in the very &s;ubject I am
upon.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="476">
Let any Man who&s;e Years and Strength
of Head allow him to look back, and to
remember how things &s;tood in <HI>London</HI> a|bout
forty to fifty Years ago, and let him
but con&s;ider the Face of the City in tho&s;e
Days, and how it is now; I mean with re|&s;pect
of Trade only, for I keep clo&s;e to my
Text.</P>
<P>The Mercers were few in number, but
great Dealers; <HI>Pater $word$ no&s;ter Row</HI> was the
Center of their Trade; that Street was built
for them, the &s;pacious Shops, back Ware-hou&s;es,
Skie-lights, and other Conveniences
made on purpo&s;e for the Trade are &s;till to
be &s;een, and the Stocks they had were pro|digious
great.</P>
<P>As were the Trade&s;men, &s;o was the
Trade; the Street was throng'd, the Coach|es
were oblig'd to &s;tand in two rows, one
&s;ide to go in, and the other to go out, for
there was no turning, and the Mercers kept
two Beadles to keep the order of the Street;
any one may &s;ee and judge what Num|bers
the Street could hold, about fifty prin|cipal
Shops took up the whole, the re&s;t
were Dependents, as Lace-Men about the
middle near <HI>Ivy-lane,</HI> the Button-&s;hops at
the end of the Street next <HI>Cheap&s;ide,</HI> and
the Cruel-&s;hops, Silk-men and Fringe-&s;hops,
near at hand in <HI>Blow-bladder-&s;treet.</HI></P>
<P>They held it in this Figure about twen|ty
Years after the Fire, and not more, and
<PB N="163" REF="477">
even in that time, the number encrea&s;ing as
the gay humour came on, we &s;aw outly|ing
Mercers &s;et up about <HI>Aldgate,</HI> the Ea&s;t
end of <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Covent-garden:</HI>
In a few Years more <HI>Covent-garden</HI> began
to get a name, and at length by degrees
intercepted the Quality &s;o much, the Streets
al&s;o being large and commodious for Coach|es,
that the Court came no more into the Ci|ty
to buy Clothes; on the contrary, the Ci|tizens
ran to the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; <HI>Pater-no&s;ter
Row</HI> began to be de&s;erted and abandon'd of
its Trade, and in le&s;s than two Years the
Mercers began to for&s;ake the Place, and
follow the Trade, &s;eeing the Trade wou'd
not follow them; as at Sea, if the &s;hoals of
Fi&s;h &s;hift their u&s;ual &s;tation, the Fi&s;hermen
follow the Fi&s;h, not the Fi&s;h the Fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row</HI> Mercers, as I re|member,
went all away to <HI>Covent-garden,</HI>
and there for &s;ome Years was the Center of
Trade; re&s;erving &s;ome &s;till within <HI>Aldgate,</HI>
and at the Corners of <HI>Lombard</HI> and <HI>Fen-Church
-Street,</HI> and within <HI>Lombard &s;treet,</HI>
as far as to <HI>Clements-lane</HI> End, and in the
Lane the Button-makers, who followed like|wi&s;e
from <HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row.</HI></P>
<P>Within about ten Years more the Trade
&s;hifted again; <HI>Covent-garden</HI> began to de|cline,
and the Mercers encrea&s;ing prodigi|ou&s;ly
went back into the City; there like
Bees unhiv'd they hover about a while,
<PB N="164" REF="478">
not knowing where to fix; but at la&s;t, as if
they would come back to the old Hive in
<HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row,</HI> but could not be admit|ted,
the &s;warm &s;ettled on <HI>Lugate-hill.</HI></P>
<P>How they are encrea&s;ed there, how they
&s;pead them&s;elves within the Gate as well as
without, and take up both &s;ides of the
way from the Ditch almo&s;t to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
except &s;uch Hou&s;es as could not be had;
how they are &s;pread in le&s;&s;er &s;warms, and
&s;ettled in other Places, as at <HI>Round court,
Fen-Church-&s;treet,</HI> and <HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> this
I need not mention.</P>
<P>This change of the Face of the Trade,
and encrea&s;e of the number of Mercers,
I do not take to inferr a proportion'd in|crea&s;e
of the Trade, tho' the Trade is cer|tainly
encreas'd too, as the numbers, and
Pride, and Wealth, of the People are en|creas'd;
but not, I &s;ay, in proportion to the
numbers of Mercers, who&s;e numbers, in&s;tead
of about fifty to &s;ixty, which they were in
the Year 1663, may now be call'd about
three or four hundred.</P>
<P>This will the better appear, when I &s;hall
tell you that there has not been the like
number of Bankrupts of any Trade in the
whole City of <HI>London,</HI> as of the Mercers, for
the&s;e 30 Years pa&s;t; and that as I am inform|ed,
there is not a Mercer's Shop on all <HI>Lud|gate-hill,</HI>
and <HI>Ludgate &s;treet,</HI> out of which
there has not one Mercer or more broke,
<PB N="165" REF="479">
&s;ince the Swarm, as I &s;aid, fir&s;t &s;ettled there;
whereas in <HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row</HI> they all grew
Rich, and very &s;eldom any fail'd or mi&s;|carried.</P>
<P>But to go on with my view of the Face
of Trade in the City, &s;ince the Mercers re|moved
from <HI>Pater-no&s;ter Row,</HI> as above;
we have &s;een almo&s;t all the Collections of
Trade&s;men, who appear'd in whole Streets
before, &s;eparated and di&s;pers'd, except the
Shoe-makers, and even tho&s;e are not &s;o
congregated in Rows as formerly; for Ex|ample:</P>
<P>How are the great Woollen-Drapers &s;e|parated
from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard, the
Sales-Men from <HI>Birchin-lane,</HI> the whole&s;ale
Uphol&s;terers on the South-&s;ide of <HI>Cornhill,</HI>
the Bankers in <HI>Lombard-&s;treet,</HI> the Cake|&s;hops
in <HI>Wood-&s;treet,</HI> even the Butchers in
great and little <HI>Ea&s;t-cheap,</HI> almo&s;t all di&s;|pers'd
and gone? We &s;ee <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard
fill'd with Cane Chair-makers on one &s;ide;
<HI>Cornhill</HI> with the meane&s;t of Trades, &s;uch
as Coffee-hou&s;es, Perriwig-makers, Pattern|&s;hops
and Pa&s;try-cooks; even <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> it
&s;elf, formerly famous for capital Traders, and
the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing whole&s;ale Dealers as
well as Shop-Keepers, how do we &s;ee it now
fill'd up with Shoe makers, Milleners, Toy|&s;hops,
and Pa&s;try-cooks? And had not the
Linen-Drapers, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s al&s;o, as
well as Numbers, is mon&s;trou&s;ly encrea&s;|ed,
<PB N="166" REF="480">
took that Street, it had been all dwind|led
into Pedling, and Petty Trade.</P>
<P>The like turn appears in the two great
Centers of the Women Merchants; I mean
the Exchange Shops; particularly at the <HI>Roy|al
Exchange,</HI> and the <HI>New-Exchange</HI> in the
<HI>Strand;</HI> both the&s;e we &s;aw full of Flouri&s;h|ing
Shops of the Millenary kin$: But now
we &s;ee all the upper part of the <HI>New Ex|change,</HI>
turn'd into a Looking-Gla&s;s Ware|hou&s;e,
the &s;everal Divi&s;ions of the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI>
turn'd into Offices of A&s;&s;urance,
Rooms for publick Sales, and the like; and
the Millenary Trade &s;eparated into innu|merable
little Commode Shops, Head Dre&s;|&s;ers
and &s;uch like People, yet taking Shops
in the mo&s;t publick parts of the City.</P>
<P>Now to ob&s;erve whence all this &s;quan|dring
of the Trade&s;men proceeded, 'tis evi|dent
it came from the encrea&s;e of the Gaie|ty
and profu&s;e Humour, which I call the Lux|ury
of the Times; as this temper of the Peo|ple
encreas'd, and the numbers al&s;o of the
People thronging to the City made a more
than common encrea&s;e of Cu&s;tomers, by the
&s;ame rule the numbers of the&s;e Trades like|wi&s;e
encreas'd, and became too great for the
&s;everal Places where they were formerly,
as it may be &s;aid, Confin'd.</P>
<P>Hence the whole&s;ale Drapers formerly
centred in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and among the Whole|&s;ale
Country Dealers in <HI>Bread-&s;treet,</HI> and
<PB N="167" REF="481">
<HI>Friday-&s;treet</HI> are &s;pread &s;o extreamly, that
the North&s;ide of <HI>Cheap&s;ide</HI> &s;eems to be
one great row of Drapers &s;hops, the Bankers
&s;pread from <HI>Lombard-&s;treet</HI> to <HI>Temple-bar,</HI>
and then to <HI>Charing-cro&s;s,</HI> and &s;o of the
re&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, the &s;ame flouri&s;hing of Pride has
dictated new Methods of Living to the Peo|ple,
and while the poore&s;t Citizens &s;trive to
live like the Rich, the Rich like the Gentry,
the Gentry like the Nobility, and the No|bility
&s;triving to out&s;hine one another, no
wonder that all the &s;umptuary Trades en|crea&s;e;
that in&s;tead of ten or twelve Coach-makers
in the City, and not quite &s;o many
at the other end of the Town, we have
the Company of Coach-makers incorporat|ed,
and whole Streets of them &s;et up toge|ther;
as in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> great <HI>Queen-&s;treet,</HI>
little <HI>Queen-&s;treet, Cow-lane, Bi&s;hop&s;gate-&s;treet,
Alder&s;gate-&s;treet,</HI> and many other
Places, where their numbers are hardly to be
reckoned up.</P>
<P>The like &s;urprizing encrea&s;e of Perriwig-makers,
of whom including Barbers, they
tell us there's not le&s;s than 30000 in the
City and adjacent parts of <HI>London;</HI> all this
is occa&s;ion'd by that one Exce&s;s of wearing
Perriwigs, a thing little known in <HI>England</HI>
fifty Year ago, and not at all four&s;core
Years ago.</P>

&s;ay to the highe&s;t, to the farthe&s;t extreme,
that it is po&s;&s;ible they can be brought to,
whether our Trade is not brought to its
Meridian al&s;o. <HI>I mu&s;t own I think it is,</HI>
and that as in all Ca&s;es of &s;uch a Nature,

things decline when they are at their Ex|tremes,
&s;o Trade not only mu&s;t decline, but

<P>Our Manufactures decline, which is to our
Trade, as Bread is to the Body, the &s;taff of
their Life; the Nations round us begin to
ta&s;t the &s;weetne&s;s of it, to &s;ee how we are

their own Labour, and &s;o keep their Mo|ney

mu&s;t come to <HI>England</HI> to purcha&s;e our Ma|nufactures.</P>

<P>LET all the Trade&s;men then and the
Dependants upon Trade in <HI>England</HI>
con&s;ider the infinite Moment it is to them
in Commerce, to promote, encourage and
&s;upport that Trade (I mean the inland Trade,
the home Trade of this Nation) by which
they are them&s;elves all &s;upported, and their
Poor maintain'd; <HI>and in a Word,</HI> by which
all the Branches of our Commerce are
brought to the pre&s;ent Immen&s;e greatne&s;s
in which they now appear, and of which
&s;o much has been &s;aid: And that I may not
be thought to be Preaching Religion here,
in&s;tead of Trade, I &s;hall clear my &s;elf of
that Scandal, by explaining my &s;elf in a few
Articles.</P>
<P>It is alledg'd, that if Vice is, as it too
plainly appears, &s;o much the &s;upport of our
Trade, when I urge you to promote and &s;up|port
<PB N="172" REF="486">
the Trade of the Nation, I tacitly in|&s;inuate,
that we mu&s;t Encourage our Vice
for the Encouragement of our Trade; but
this is &s;uch a Corrupt u&s;e of a ju&s;t rea&s;on|ing,
that it needs no great art to overthrow
it.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, but that notwith&s;tand|ing
all that has been &s;aid of our Vice pro|pagating
our Commerce, yet our Trade
might be &s;upported, our Trade&s;men be kept
employ'd, and their Shops &s;till be open'd,
tho' a Time of Reformation were to come,
which I doubt is but too far off.</P>
<P>Perhaps it wou'd at fir&s;t give a turn to the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of Home-Trade, and there
might be &s;ome little &s;hock given to our
&s;umptuary Employments, and to tho&s;e Shops
and Shambles of Vice, the Victualling
and Liquor Trades; but God forbid, that
we &s;hou'd be under&s;tood to prompt the Ex|ce&s;&s;es
of the Age, in order to pre&s;erve and
encrea&s;e that particular branch of Com|merce.</P>
<P>I doubt not to &s;hew the World, that we
are not obliged to run into Extremes and
Extravagancies in Dre&s;&s; to promote the Silk
Manufactures, to have our poor People turn
Sots and Drunkards, to promote the Malt
and Brewing Trade, or the rich to &s;upport
the Wine Trade; and &s;o of other Madne&s;&s;es
which are the pre&s;ent Grievances of the
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="487">
The Silk Manufacture, as it is now improv|ed
and made our own, is a very great help
to Trade, as well the Home Trade as the
Foreign Trade; and e&s;pecially is a timely
relief to us, in the pre&s;ent evident decay
of our Woollen, which I call our National
Manufacture; and 'tis not only nece&s;&s;ary to
us in Trade, but it is &s;o in it &s;elf al&s;o;
nor is it to be all charg'd to the Account of
our Vice or our Pride: We may be as
Proud, and as Vain, and as Gay, as Luxuri|ous,
and as Vitious in our Woollen Manu|facture,
as in our Silk, and I doubt we are
&s;o.</P>
<P>The Silk is ordinarily the wear and dre&s;s
of the Ladies, and I am not willing to be
&s;o unju&s;t, as to lay all the Pride at their
Doors. I doubt there is not &s;o much Odds
between the Sexes as to Crime; but
that if they were all join'd in our account of
publick Follies, they would have little rea&s;on
to complain of partiality: But this is what I
think may be in&s;i&s;ted on, a Reformation might
effect Trade in many particular things, but
need not overthrow and de&s;troy it in general.</P>
<P>The Silk Manufacture might be very con|&s;iderable
in <HI>England,</HI> if the Ladies went a
little more mode&s;tly dre&s;s'd, if they were
a little le&s;s Curious, le&s;s Extravagant, le&s;s
Exotick, and abated a little of their Exce&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The Wine Trade would &s;till be very
Con&s;iderable, tho' the Gentlemen abated
<PB N="174" REF="488">
their immoderate Drinking, and went Home
now and then a little &s;ooner, and a little
&s;oberer.</P>
<P>The Malt and Brewing Trades, the Di&s;|tilling
Spirits, and the Importation of Bran|dy
might be &s;till very great Articles in our
Trade, and all together be very great &s;up|ports
to the publick Revenue, and to the
Government, tho' not &s;o great as they now
are, if the number of Alehou&s;es were a
little le&s;s, and tho' the Gin-&s;hops and Bran|dy-&s;hops
were fewer by &s;ome thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>Trade need not be de&s;troy'd, tho' Vice
were mortally wounded, much le&s;s need
we be oblig'd to encourage Flaming Luxu|ry
for fear of di&s;couraging our Commerce
le&s;&s;ening our Revenue, or &s;tarving our Poor.</P>
<P>But there are Vices in Trade, which I
wou'd direct the Complete Trade&s;men to
avoid, and which tend indeed to de&s;troy
our Trade, to wound it in the mo&s;t tender
parts, and to expo&s;e it, in the End, to a
total Decay, if not to Death and De&s;truc|tion;
I mean as to its pro&s;perous and flou|ri&s;hing
Circum&s;tances. It is true, while there
are People, while we are a populous, a nu|merous
Nation, we mu&s;t have Trade, Peo|ple
make Trade of mere nece&s;&s;ity, and for
mere nece&s;&s;ity Men mu&s;t have Food and
Clothes, and that alone will continue &s;ome
Trade; but this will not &s;upport the de|gree
of Trade which mu&s;t be maintain'd,
<PB N="175" REF="489">
to make our Trade be what we call great
and flouri&s;hing.</P>
<P>Nor indeed will the Home-Trade of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
in a few more Years, be like what it
now is, if we do not enter into &s;ome new
Mea&s;ures for its &s;upport; and this is what
I wou'd move the Complete <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Trade&s;|men
to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and main thing is this, that
while we are call'd Home Traders, we &s;hou'd
not be promoters of Foreign Trade in pre|judice
of our own.</P>
<P>It has been of great weight in my Direc|tions
to the Complete Trade&s;men, in order
to per&s;uade him to go on &s;ucce&s;sfully,
that he &s;hou'd not be above his Bu&s;ine&s;s,
that he &s;hou'd not be a&s;ham'd of his Shop
or of his Counter, that he &s;hou'd be dili|gent
in all his Affairs, that he &s;hou'd add Ap|plication
and Indu&s;try, in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to
Knowledge and Experience of his Bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>But let me add, if our Manufactures are
the Trade&s;mens Life, if they are his Trade,
why &s;hou'd they not be his Wear? why
&s;hould the Merchant be above his own Ma|nufactures?
'tis an ab&s;urdity in Trade; and
however frequent it be, it cannot be pleaded
for; that whereas the Con&s;umption of the
Manufacture is the Life and Soul of the Ma|nufacturers,
and of the Trade&s;men that deal
in it, tho&s;e Manufacturers and Trade&s;men
&s;hou'd with-hold their Hands from that Con|&s;umption,
<PB N="176" REF="490">
and be above wearing the Manu|factures
they get their Bread by.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy humour, which at pre|&s;ent,
I may &s;ay, runs in the Blood of this
whole Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that while we &s;ee al|mo&s;t
all the Nations, in <HI>Europe</HI> labouring
to di&s;courage our Manufacture, and to wear
their own, however inferior in goodne&s;s$
while we &s;ee them Diligent to promo$$$$
their own Growth, and employ their own
Poor, and rather to content them&s;elves with
wor&s;e and meaner things, I mean as t$
Cloathing, than they wou'd otherwi&s;e make
u&s;e of, that they may encourage and employ
their own People; we &s;ee our own Nation
at the &s;ame time pleas'd with any Foreign
Manufacture, rather than their own, and
choo&s;ing to dre&s;s in the tawdry and &s;orry
trifles of Strangers, rather than in the much
more valuable Articles of their own Work|man&s;hip;
as if they were Sick and Surfeit|ed
with their own Manufactures, and will|ing
to &s;ee their own People &s;tarve, rather
than encourage them by wearing the very
Goods they Sell.</P>
<P>I have only room to add, that while we
practi&s;e this, we ought never more to com|plain
of the Decay of our Trade.</P>
