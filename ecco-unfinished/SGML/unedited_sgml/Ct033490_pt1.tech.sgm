<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DELICACY of TASTE and PAS$ION.</HEAD>
<P>SOME People are &s;ubject to a certain <HI>delicacy</HI>
of <HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which makes them extremely &s;en&s;i|ble
to all the accidents of life, and gives them
a lively joy upon every pro&s;perous event, as well as
a piercing grief, when they meet with misfortunes
and adver&s;ity. Favours and good offices ea&s;ily engage
their friend&s;hip; while the &s;malle&s;t injury provokes
their re&s;entment. Any honour or mark of di&s;tinc|tion
elevates them above mea&s;ure; but they are as
&s;en&s;ibly touched with contempt. People of this cha|racter
have, no doubt, much more lively enjoyments,
as well as more pungent &s;orrows, than men of cool
and &s;edate tempers: But, I believe, when every thing
is balanced, there is no one, who would not rather
chu&s;e to be of the latter character, were he entire|ly
ma&s;ter of his own di&s;po&s;ition. Good or ill for|tune
is very little at our own di&s;po&s;al: And when
a per&s;on, that has this &s;en&s;ibility of temper, meets
with any misfortune, his &s;orrow or re&s;entment takes
<PB N="4" REF="7">
intire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of him, and deprives him of all re|li&s;h
in the common occurrences of life; of which the
right enjoyment forms the greate&s;t part of our hap|pine&s;s.
Great plea&s;ures are much le&s;s frequent than
great pains; &s;o that a &s;en&s;ible temper mu&s;t meet
with fewer trials in the former way than in the lat|ter.
Not to mention, than men of &s;uch lively pa&s;|&s;ions
are apt to be tran&s;ported beyond all bounds of
prudence and di&s;cretion, and to take fal&s;e &s;teps in
the conduct of life, which are often irretrievable.</P>
<P>THERE is a <HI>delicacy</HI> of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> ob&s;ervable in &s;ome
men, which very much re&s;embles this <HI>delicacy</HI> of
<HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> and produces the &s;ame &s;en&s;ibility to beauty
and deformity of every kind, as that does to pro|&s;perity
and adver&s;ity, obligations and in injuries. When
you pre&s;ent a poem or a picture to a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of this talent, the delicacy of his feeling, makes
him be touched very &s;en&s;ibly with every part of it;
nor are the ma&s;terly &s;trokes perceived with more ex|qui&s;ite
reli&s;h and &s;atisfaction, than the negligences
or ab&s;urdities with di&s;gu&s;t and unea&s;ine&s;s. A polite
and judicious conver&s;ation affords him the highe&s;t
entertainment; rudene&s;s or impertinence is as great
a puni&s;hment to him. In &s;hort, delicacy of ta&s;te has
the &s;ame effect as delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion: It enlarges
the &s;phere both of our happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, and
makes us &s;en&s;ible to pains as well as plea&s;ures, which
e&s;cape the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="8">
I BELIEVE, however, there is no one, who will
not agree with me, that notwith&s;tanding this re&s;em|blance,
a delicacy of ta&s;te is as much to be de&s;ired
and cultivated as a delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion is to be la|mented,
and to be remedied, if po&s;&s;ible. The good
or ill accidents of life are very little at our di|&s;po&s;al;
but we are pretty much ma&s;ters what
books we &s;hall read, what diver&s;ions we &s;hall par|take
of, and what company we &s;hall keep. Phi|lo&s;ophers
have endeavoured to render happine&s;s en|tirely
independent of every thing external. That
is impo&s;&s;ible to be <HI>attained:</HI> But every wi&s;e man
will endeavour to place his happine&s;s on &s;uch ob|jects
as depend mo&s;t upon him&s;elf: and <HI>that</HI> is not
to be <HI>attained</HI> &s;o much by any other means as by
this delicacy of &s;entiment. When a man is po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
of that talent, he is more happy by what plea&s;es
his ta&s;te, than by what grati&s;ies his appetites, and
receives more enjoyment from a poem or a piece
of rea&s;oning than the mo&s;t expen&s;ive luxury can
afford.</P>
<P>How far delicacy of ta&s;te, and that of pa&s;&s;ion,
are connected together in the original frame of the
mind, it is hard to determine. To me there ap|pears
a very con&s;iderable connexion between them.
For we may ob&s;erve that women, who have more
delicate pa&s;&s;ions then men, have al&s;o a more delicate
<PB N="6" REF="9">
ta&s;te of the ornaments of life, of dre&s;s, equipage,
and the ordinary decencies of behaviour. Any ex|cellency
in the&s;e hits their ta&s;te much &s;ooner than
ours; and when you plea&s;e their ta&s;te, you &s;oon en|gage
their affections.</P>
<P>BUT whatever connection there may be original|ly
betwixt the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions, I am per&s;uaded, that
nothing is &s;o proper to cure us of this delicacy of
pa&s;&s;ion, as the cultivating of that higher and more
refined ta&s;te, which enables us to judge of the cha|racters
of men, of compo&s;itions of genius, and of
the productions of the nobler arts. A greater or
le&s;s reli&s;h of tho&s;e obvious beauties which &s;trike the
&s;en&s;es, depends entirely upon the greater or le&s;s &s;en|&s;ibility
of the temper: But with regard to the &s;cien|ces
and liberal arts, a fine ta&s;te is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure
the &s;ame with &s;trong &s;en&s;e, or at lea&s;t depends &s;o
much upon it, that they are in&s;eparable. To judge
aright of a compo&s;ition of genius, there are &s;o many
views to be taken in, &s;o many circum&s;tances to be
compared, and &s;uch a knowledge of human nature
requi&s;ite, that no man, who is not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
founde&s;t judgment, will ever make a tolerable critic
in &s;uch performances. And this is a new rea&s;on for
cultivating a reli&s;h in the liberal arts. Our judgment
will &s;trengthen by this exerci&s;e: We &s;hall form ju&s;ter
notions of life: Many things, which plea&s;e or afflict
others, will appear to us too frivolous to engage our
<PB N="7" REF="10">
attention: And we &s;hall lo&s;e by degrees that &s;en&s;ibi|lity
and delicacy of pa&s;&s;ion, which is &s;o incommo|dious.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps I have gone too far in &s;aying, That
a cultivated ta&s;te for the polite arts extingui&s;hes the
pa&s;&s;ions, and renders us indifferent to tho&s;e objects
which are &s;o fondly pur&s;ued by the re&s;t of mankind.
On farther re&s;lection, I find, that it rather improves
our &s;en&s;ibility for all the tender and agreeable pa&s;|&s;ions;
at the &s;ame time that it renders the mind
incapable of the rougher and more boi&s;terous e|motions.</P>
<Q><L>Ingenuas didici&s;&s;e fideliter artes,</L>
<L>Emollit mores, nec &s;init e&s;&s;e feros.</L></Q>
<P>FOR this, I think there may be a&s;&s;igned two very
natural rea&s;ons. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, nothing is &s;o im|proving
to the temper as the &s;tudy of the beauties,
either of poetry, eloquence, mu&s;ick, or painting.
They give a certain elegance of &s;entiment, to which
the re&s;t of mankind are entire &s;trangers. The emo|tions
they excite are &s;o&s;t and tender. They draw
the mind off from the hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s and inte|re&s;t;
cheri&s;h reflection; di&s;po&s;e to tranquillity; and
produce an agreeable melancholy, which, of all di&s;|po&s;itions
of the mind, is the be&s;t &s;uited to love and
friend&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="11">
In the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, a delicacy of ta&s;te is faour|able
to love and friend&s;hip, by confining our choice
to few people, and making us indifferent to the
company and conver&s;ation of the greate&s;t part of
men. You will very &s;eldom find, that mere men
of the world, whatever &s;trong &s;en&s;e they may be
endowed with, are very nice in di&s;tingui&s;hing of cha|racters,
or in marking tho&s;e in&s;en&s;ible differences and
gradations which make one man preferable to ano|ther.
Any one, that has competent &s;en&s;e, is &s;uffi|cient
for their entertainment: They talk to him,
of their plea&s;ure and affairs, with the &s;ame frank|ne&s;s
as they would to another; and finding many,
who are fit to &s;upply his place, they never feel any
vacancy or want in his ab&s;ence. But to make u&s;e
of the allu&s;ion of a celebrated<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Menf.</HI> FONTENELLS, <HI>Plura$it&eacute; de$ Mendes.</HI> Soir &amp;</NOTE> FRENCH author, the
judgment may be compared to a clock or watch,
where the mo&s;t ordinary machine is &s;ufficient to tell
the hours; but the mo&s;t elaborate and artificial alone
can point out the minutes and &s;econds, and di&s;tin|gui&s;h
the &s;malle&s;t differences of time. One that has
well dige&s;ted his knowledge both of books and men,
has little enjoyment but in the company of a few &s;e|lect
companions. He feels too &s;en&s;ibly, how much
all the re&s;t of mankind fall &s;hort of the notions which
he has entertained. And, his affections being thus
<PB N="9" REF="12">
confined within a narrow circle, no wonder he carries
them further than if they were more general and
undi&s;tingui&s;hed. The gaiety and frolic of a bottle-companion
improves with him into a &s;olid friendship:
And the ardours of a youthful appetite become an
elegant pa&s;&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the LIBERTY of the PRESS.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more apt to &s;urprize a fo|reigner,
than the extreme liberty, which we
enjoy in this country, of communicating whatever
we plea&s;e to the public, and of openly cen&s;uring
every mea&s;ure, entered into by the king or his mi|ni&s;ters.
If the admini&s;tration re&s;olve upon war, 'tis
affirmed, that either wilfully or ignorantly they mi&s;|take
the intere&s;t of the nation, and that peace, in
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs, is infinitely prefer|able.
If the pa&s;&s;ion of the mini&s;ters lie towards
peace, our political writers breathe nothing but wa$
and deva&s;tation, and repre&s;ent the pacific conduct of
the government as mean and pu&s;illanimous. As this
liberty is not indulged in any other government,
either republican or monarchical; in HOLLAND and
VENICE, no more than in FRANCE or SPAIN; it
may very naturally give occa&s;ion to the&s;e two que&s;|tions,
<HI>How it happens that</HI> GREAT BRITAIN <HI>enjoys
&s;uch a peculiar privilege?</HI> and <HI>Whether the unlimited
exerci&s;e of this liberty be advantageous or prejudicial
to the public?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14">
As to the fu&s;t que&s;tion, Why the laws indulge
us in &s;uch an extraordinary liberty? I believe the
rea&s;on may be derived from our mixed form of go|vernment,
which is neither wholly monarchical, nor
wholly republican. It will be found, if I mi&s;take
not, a true ob&s;ervation in politics, that the two ex|tremes
in government, liberty and &s;lavery, common|ly
approach neare&s;t to each other; and that as you
depart from the extremes, and mix a little of mo|narchy
with liberty, the government becomes al|ways
the more free; and on the other hand, when
you mix a little of liberty with monarchy, the yoke
becomes always the more grievous and intolerable.
I &s;hall endeavour to explain my&s;elf. In a govern|ment,
&s;uch as that of FRANCE, which is entirely ab|&s;olute,
and where laws, cu&s;tom, and religion concur,
all of them, to make the people fully &s;atisfied with
their condition, the monarch cannot entertain the
lea&s;t <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> again&s;t his &s;ubjects, and therefore is
apt to indulge them in great <HI>liberties</HI> both of &s;peech
and action. In a government altogether republican,
&s;uch as that of HOLLAND, where there is no ma|gi&s;trate
&s;o eminent as to give <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> to the &s;tate,
there is no danger in intru&s;ting the magi&s;trates with
very large di&s;cretionary powers; and though many
advantages re&s;ult from &s;uch powers, in the pre$er|ing
peace and order, yet they lay a con&s;iderable
re&s;traint on men's actions, and make every pri|vate
&s;ubject pay a great re&s;pect to the government.
<PB N="13" REF="15">
Thus it &s;eems evident, that the two extremes of
ab&s;olute monarchy and of a republic, approach very
near to each other in &s;ome material circum&s;tan|ces.
In the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> the magi&s;trate has no jealou&s;y of
the people: In the <HI>&s;econd,</HI> the people have no jea|lou&s;y
of the magi&s;trate: Which want of jealou&s;y be|gets
a mutual confidence and tru&s;t in both ca&s;es,
and produces a &s;pecies of liberty in monarchies, and
of arbitrary power in republics.</P>
<P>TO ju&s;tify the other part of the foregoing ob|&s;ervation,
that in every government the means are
mo&s;t wide of each other, and that the mixtures of
monarchy and liberty render the yoke either more
ea&s;y or more grievous; I mu&s;t take notice of a re|mark
of TACITUS with regard to the ROMANS
under the emperors, that they neither could bear
total &s;lavery nor total liberty, <HI>Nec totam &s;ervitutem,
nec totam liberta$em pati po&s;lunt.</HI> This remark a ce|lebrated
poet has tran&s;lated and applied to the ENG|LISH,
in his lively de&s;cription of queen ELIZABETH'S
policy and government.</P>
<Q><L>Et f$t ai$er &s;on joug a $ Anglois indomp&eacute;,</L>
<L>$ui ne peut ni &s;e$$vir, ni vivre en libert$.</L>
<L>HENRIADE, Liv. 1.</L></Q>
<P>ACCORDING to the&s;e remarks, we are to con&s;i|der
the ROMAN government under the emperors as
a mixture of de&s;poti&s;m and liberty, where the de|&s;poti&s;m
<PB N="14" REF="16">
prevailed; and the ENGLISH government
as a mixture of the &s;ame kind, but where the liberty
predominates. The con&s;equences are exactly con|formable
to the foregoing ob&s;ervation; and &s;uch as
may be expected from tho&s;e mixed forms of govern|ment,
which beget a mutual watchfulne&s;s and jealou&s;y.
The ROMAN emperors were, many of them, the mo&s;t
frightful tyrants that ever di&s;graced human nature;
and 'tis evident their cruelty was chiefly excited by
their <HI>jealou&s;y,</HI> and by their ob&s;erving, that all the
great men of ROME bore with impatience the do|minion
of a family, which, but a little before, was
no ways &s;uperior to their own. On the other hand,
as the republican part of the government prevails in
ENGLAND, though with a great mixture of monar|chy,
'tis obliged, for its own pre&s;ervation, to main|tain
a watchful <HI>jealou&s;y</HI> over the magi&s;trates, to remove
all di&s;cretionary powers, and to &s;ecure every one's
life and fortune by general and inflexible laws. No
action mu&s;t be deemed a crime but what the law
has plainly determined to be &s;uch: No crime mu&s;t
be imputed to a man but from a legal proof before
his judges; and even the&s;e judges mu&s;t be his
fellow-&s;ubjects, who are obliged, by their own in|tere&s;t,
to have a watchful eye over the encroachments
and violence of the mini&s;ters. From the&s;e cau&s;es it
proceeds, that there is as much liberty, and eyen,
perhaps, licentiou&s;ne&s;s in BRITAIN, as there were
formerly &s;lavery and tyranny in ROME.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
THESE principles account for the great liberty of
the pre&s;s in the&s;e kingdoms, beyond what is indulg|ed
in any other government. 'Tis &s;ufficiently known,
that arbitrary power would &s;teal in upon us, were
we not extremely watchful to prevent its progre&s;s,
and were there not an ea&s;y method of conveying
the alarum from one end of the kingdom to the
other. The &s;pirit of the people mu&s;t frequently be
rouzed in order to curb the ambition of the court;
and the dread of rou&s;ing this &s;pirit, mu&s;t be em|ployed
to prevent that ambition. Nothing &s;o ef|fectual
to this purpo&s;e as the liberty of the pre&s;s,
by which all the learning, wit and genius of the
nation may be employed on the &s;ide of liberty, and
every one be animated to its defence. As long,
therefore, as the republican part of our government
can maintain it&s;elf again&s;t the monarchical, it mu&s;t
be extremely jealous of the liberty of the pre&s;s, as
of the utmo&s;t importance to its pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore the liberty of the pre&s;s is &s;o e&s;|&s;ential
to the &s;upport of our mixed government;
this &s;ufficiently decides the &s;econd que&s;tion, <HI>Whether
this liberty be advantageous or prejudicial;</HI> there be|ing
nothing of greater importance in every &s;tate
than the pre&s;ervation of the ancient government,
e&s;pecially if it be a free one. But I would $ain go
a &s;tep farther, and a&s;&s;ert, that &s;uch a liberty is at|tended
<PB N="16" REF="18">
with &s;o few inconveniencies, that it may be
claimed as the common right of mankind, and ought
to be indulged them almo&s;t in every government:
except the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, to which indeed it would
prove fatal. We need not dread from this liberty
any &s;uch ill con&s;equences as followed from the ha|rangues
of the popular demagogues of ATHENS and
tribunes of ROME. A man reads a book or pam|phlet
alone and $$olly. There is none pre&s;ent from
whom he can catch the pa&s;&s;ion by contagion. He
is not hurried away by the force and energy of action.
And &s;hould he be wrought up to ever &s;o &s;editious
a humour, there is no violent re&s;olution pre&s;ented
to him, by which he can immediately vent his pa&s;|&s;ion.
The liberty of the pre&s;s, therefore, however
abu&s;ed, can &s;carce ever excite popular tumults or
rebellion. And as to tho&s;e murmurs or &s;ecret di&s;|contents
it may occa&s;ion, 'tis better they &s;hould get
vent in words, that they may come to the know|ledge
of the magi&s;trate before it be too late, in or|der
to his providing a remedy again&s;t them. Man|kind,
it is true, have always a greater propen&s;ion to
believe what is &s;aid to the di&s;advantage of their go|vernors,
than the contrary; but this inclination is
in&s;eparable from them, whether they have liberty
or not. A whi&s;per may fly as quick, and be as
pernicious as a pamphlet. Nay, it will be more per|nicious,
where men are not accu&s;tomed to think freely,
or di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt truth and fal&s;hood.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19">
IT has al&s;o been found, as the experience of man|kind
increa&s;es, that the <HI>pe$ple</HI> are no &s;uch dange|rous
mon&s;ter as they have been repre&s;ented, and that
it is in every re&s;pect better to guide them, like ra|tional
creatures, than to lead or drive them, like
brute bea&s;ts. Before the United Provinces &s;et the
example, toleration was deemed incompatible with
good government; and it was thought impo&s;&s;ible,
that a number of religious &s;ects could live together
in harmony and peace, and have all of them an
equal affection to their common country, and to each
other. ENGLAND has &s;et a like example of civil
liberty; and though this liberty &s;eems to occa&s;ion
&s;ome &s;mall ferment at pre&s;ent, it has not as yet
produced any pernicious effects; and it is to be
hoped, that men, being every day more accu&s;tomed
to the free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public affairs, will improve
in the judgment of them, and be with greater dif|ficulty
&s;educed by every idle rumour and popular
clamour.</P>
<P>IT is a very comfortable reflection to the lovers
of liberty, that this peculiar privilege of BRITAIN
is of a kind that cannot ea&s;ily be wre&s;ted from us,
but mu&s;t la&s;t as long as our government remains,
in any degree, free and independent. It is &s;eldom,
that liberty of any kind is lo$t all at once. Slavery
has &s;o frightful an a&s;pect to men accu&s;tomed to

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of IMPUDENCE and MODESTY.</HEAD>
<P>I AM of opinion, That the common complaints
again&s;t Providence are ill-grounded, and that
the good or bad qualities of men are the cau&s;es of
their good or bad fortune, more than what is gene|rally
imagined. There are, no doubt, in&s;tances to
the contrary, and the&s;e too pretty numerous; but few,
in compari&s;on of the in&s;tances we have of a right
di&s;tribution of pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity: nor indeed
could it be otherwi&s;e from the common cour&s;e of
human affairs. To be endowed with a benevolent
di&s;po&s;ition, and to love others, will almo&s;t infalli|bly
procure love and e&s;teem; which is the chief
circum&s;tance in life, and facilitates every enterprize
and undertaking; be&s;ides the &s;atisfaction, which im|mediately
re&s;ults from it. The ca&s;e is much the
&s;ame with the other virtues. Pro&s;perity is natu|rally,
though not nece&s;&s;arily, attached to virtue and
merit; and adver&s;ity, in like manner, to vice and
folly.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
I MUST, however, confe&s;s, that this rule admits
of an exception, with regard to one moral quality;
and that <HI>mode&s;ty</HI> has a natural tendency to conceal
a man's talents, as <HI>impudence</HI> di&s;plays them to the
utmo&s;t, and has been the only cau&s;e why many have
ri&s;en in the world, under all the di&s;advantages of
low birth and little merit. Such indolence and in|capacity
is there in the generality of mankind, that
they are apt to receive a man for whatever he has
a mind to put him&s;elf off for; and admit his over|bearing
airs as proofs of that merit which he a&s;&s;umes
to him&s;elf. A decent a&s;&s;urance &s;eems to be the na|tural
attendant of virtue; and few men can di&s;tin|gui&s;h
impudence from it: As, on the other hand,
diffidence, being the natural re&s;ult of vice and folly,
has drawn di&s;grace upon mode&s;ty, which in outward
appearance &s;o nearly re&s;embles it.</P>
<P>As impudence, though really a vice, has the &s;ame
effects upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue;
&s;o we may ob&s;erve, that it is almo&s;t as difficult to
be attained, and is, in that re&s;pect, di&s;tingui&s;hed
from all the other vices, which are acquired with
little pains, and continually encreate upon indulgence.
Many a man, being &s;en&s;ible that mode&s;ty is extreme|ly
prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has
re&s;olved to be impudent, and to put a bold face
upon the matter: But, it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch
<PB N="21" REF="23">
people have &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in the attempt, but
have been obliged to relap&s;e into their primitive
mode&s;ty. Nothing carries a man through the world
like a true genuine natural impudence. Its counter|feit
is good for nothing, nor can ever &s;upport it|&s;elf.
In any other attempt, whatever faults a man
commits and is &s;en&s;ible of, he is &s;o much the nearer
his end. But when he endeavours at impudence,
if he ever failed in the attempt, the remembrance
of that failure will make him blu&s;h, and will infal|libly
di&s;concert him: After which every blu&s;h is a
cau&s;e for new blu&s;hes, till he be found out to be an
arrant cheat, and a vain pretender to impudence.</P>
<P>IF any thing can give a mode&s;t man more a&s;&s;u|rance,
it mu&s;t be &s;ome advantages of fortune, which
chance procures to him. Riches naturally gain a
man a favourable reception in the world, and give
merit a double lu&s;tre, when a per&s;on is endow|ed
with it; and &s;upply its place, in a great mea|&s;ure,
when it is ab&s;ent. It is wonderful to ob&s;erve
what airs of &s;uperiority fools and knaves, with large
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, give them&s;elves above men of the greate&s;t
merit in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make
any &s;trong oppo&s;ition to the&s;e u&s;urpations; or rather
&s;eem to favour them by the mode&s;ty of their be|haviour.
Their good &s;en&s;e and experience make
them diffident of their judgment, and cau&s;e them to
examine every thing with the greate&s;t accuracy: As,
<PB N="22" REF="24">
on the other hand, the delicacy of their &s;entiments
makes them timorous le&s;t they commit faults, and
le&s;e in the practice of the world that integrity of
virtue, &s;o to &s;peak, of which they are &s;o jealous. To
make wi&s;dom agree with confidence, is as difficult
as to reconcile vice and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>THESE are the reflections which have occurred up|on
this &s;ubject of impudence and mode&s;ty; and I
hope the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee them
wrought into the following allegory,</P>
<P>JUPITER, in the beginning, joined VIRTUE,
WISDOM, and CONFIDENCE together; and VICE,
FOLLY, and DIFFIDENCE: And thus connected,
&s;ent them into the world. But though he thought
he had matched them with great judgment, and &s;aid
that <HI>Confidence</HI> was the natural companion of <HI>Vir|tue,</HI>
and that <HI>Vice</HI> de&s;erved to be attended with <HI>Dif|fidence,</HI>
they had not gone far before di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e
among them. <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> who was the guide of the
one company, was always accu&s;tomed before &s;he
ventured upon any road, however beaten, to exa|mine
it carefully; to enquire whither it led; what
dangers, difficulties and hindrances might po&s;&s;bly
or probably occur in it. In the&s;e deliberations &s;he
u&s;ually con&s;umed &s;ome time; which delay was very
di&s;plea&s;ing to <HI>Confidence,</HI> who was always inclined
to hurry on, without much forethought or delibe|ration,
<PB N="23" REF="25">
in the fir&s;t road he met. <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Virtue</HI>
were in&s;eparable: But <HI>Confidence</HI> one day, following
his impetuous nature, advanced a con&s;iderable way
before his guides and companions; and not feeling
any want of their company, he never enquired after
them, nor ever met with them more. In like man|ner,
the other &s;ociety, though joined by JUPITER,
di&s;agreed and &s;eparated. As <HI>Folly</HI> &s;aw very little way
before her, &s;he had nothing to determine concern|ing
the goodne&s;s of roads, nor could give the pre|ference
to one above another; and this want of re&s;o|lution
was encrea&s;ed by <HI>Diffidence,</HI> who, with her
doubts and &s;cruples, always retarded the journey.
This was a great annoyance to <HI>Vice,</HI> who loved not
to hear of difficulties and delays, and was never
&s;atisfied without his full career, in whatever his in|clinations
led him to. <HI>Folly,</HI> he knew, though &s;he
hearkened to <HI>Diffidence,</HI> would be ea&s;ily managed
when alone; and therefore, as a vicious hor&s;e throws
his rider, he openly beat away this controller of all
his plea&s;ures, and proceeded in his journey with
<HI>Folly,</HI> from whom he is in&s;eparable. <HI>Confidence</HI> and
<HI>Diffidence</HI> being, after this manner, both thrown loo&s;e
from their re&s;pective companies, wandered $or &s;ome
time; till at la&s;t chance led them at the &s;ame time
to one village. <HI>Confidence&punc;</HI> went directly up to the
great hou&s;e, which belonged to WEALTH, the lord
of the village; and without &s;taying for a porter, in|truded
him&s;elf immediately into the innermo&s;t apart|ments,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
where he found <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly</HI> well received
before him. He joined the train; recommended him|&s;elf
very quickly to his landlord; and entered into
&s;uch familiarity with <HI>Vice,</HI> that he was enli&s;ted in the
&s;ame company with <HI>Folly.</HI> They were frequent gue&s;ts
of <HI>Wealth,</HI> and from that moment in&s;eparable. <HI>Diffi|dence,</HI>
in the mean time, not daring to approach the
great hou&s;e, accepted of an invitation from POVERTY,
one of the tenants; and entering the cottage, found
<HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> who being repul&s;ed by the land|lord,
had retired thither. <HI>Virtue</HI> took compa&s;&s;ion of
her, and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> found, from her temper, that &s;he
would ea&s;ily improve: So they admitted her into their
&s;ociety. Accordingly, by their means, &s;he altered
in a little time &s;omewhat of her manner, and be|coming
much more amiable and engaging, was now
known by the name of <HI>Mode&s;ty.</HI> As ill company has
a greater effect than good, <HI>Confidence,</HI> though more
refractory to coun&s;el and example, degenerated &s;o far
by the &s;ociety of <HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly,</HI> as to pa&s;s by the
name of IMPUDENCE. Mankind, who &s;aw the&s;e &s;o|cieties
as JUPITER fir&s;t joined them, and know no|thing
of the&s;e mutual de&s;ertions, are thereby led into
&s;trange mi&s;takes; and wherever they &s;ee <HI>Impudence,</HI>
make account of finding <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> and
wherever they ob&s;erve <HI>Mode&s;ty,</HI> call her attendants
<HI>Vice</HI> and <HI>Folly.</HI></P>

con&s;i&s;ts in the character and conduct of the gover|nors,
mo&s;t political di&s;putes would be at an end,
and all <HI>Zeal</HI> for one con&s;titution above another, mu&s;t

a friend to Moderation, I cannot forbear condem|ning
this &s;entiment, and &s;hould be &s;orry to think,
that human affairs admit of no greater &s;tability, than
what they receive from the ca&s;ual humours and cha|racters
of particular men.</P>
<P>'TIS true, tho&s;e who maintain, that the goodne&s;s
of all government con&s;i&s;ts in the goodne&s;s of the ad|mini&s;tration,
<PB N="26" REF="28">
may cite many particular in&s;tances in
hi&s;tory, where the very &s;am$ government, in diffe|rent
hands, has varied &s;uddenly into the two oppo|&s;ite
extremes of good and bad. Compare the FRENCH
government under HENRY III. and under HENRY
IV. Oppre&s;&s;ion, levity, artifice on the part of the
rulers; faction, &s;edition, treachery, rebellion, di&s;loy|alty
on the part of the &s;ubjects: The&s;e compo&s;e the
character of the former mi&s;erable aera. But when the
patriot and heroic prince, who &s;ucceeded, was once
firmly &s;eated on the throne, the government, the
people, every thing &s;eemed to be totally changed;
and all from the difference of the temper and &s;enti|ments
of the&s;e two &s;overeigns. An equal difference
of a contrary kind, may be found on comparing the
reigns of ELIZABETH and JAMES, at lea&s;t with re|gard
to foreign affairs: and in&s;tances of this kind
may be multiplied, almo&s;t without number, from an|cient
as well as modern hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>BUT here I would beg leave to make a di&s;tinction.
All ab&s;olute governments (and &s;uch, in a great mea|&s;ure,
was that of ENGLAND, till the middle of
the la&s;t century, notwith&s;tanding the numerous pane|gyrics
on ancient ENGLISH liberty) mu&s;t very much
depend on the admini&s;tration; and this is one of the
great inconveniences of that form of government.
But a republican and free government would be a
mo&s;t obvious ab&s;urdity, if the particular checks and
<PB N="27" REF="29">
controuls, provided by the con&s;titution, had really
no influence, and made it not the intere&s;t, even of
bad men, to operate for the public good. Such is
the intention of the&s;e forms of government, and &s;uch
is their real effect, where they are wi&s;ely con&s;titu|ted:
As, on the other hand, they are the &s;ources
of all di&s;order, and of the blacke&s;t crimes, where
either &s;kill or hone&s;ty has been wanting in their origi|nal
frame and in&s;titution.</P>
<P>SO great is the force of laws, and of particular
forms of government, and &s;o little dependence have
they on the humours and tempers of men, that con|&s;equences
almo&s;t as general and certain may be de|duced
from them, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, as any which
the mathematical &s;ciences afford us.</P>
<P>THE ROMAN government gave the whole legi&s;|lative
power to the commons, without allowing a
negative either to the nobility or con&s;uls. This un|bounded
power the commons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in a collec|tive,
not in a repre&s;entative body. The con&s;equen|ces
were: When the people, by &s;ucce&s;s and conque&s;t,
had become very numerous, and had &s;pread them|&s;elves
to a great di&s;tance from the capital, the city-tribes,
tho' the mo&s;t contemptible, carried almo&s;t every
vote: They were, therefore mo&s;t cajoled by every
one who affected popularity: They were &s;upported in
idlene&s;s by the general di&s;tribution of corn, and by
<PB N="28" REF="30">
particular bribes, which they received from almo&s;t
every candidate: By this means they became every
day more licentious, and the CAMPUS MARTIUS
was a perpetual &s;cene of tumult and &s;edition: Armed
&s;laves were introduced among the&s;e ra&s;cally citizens;
&s;o that the whole government fell into anarchy, and
the greate&s;t happine&s;s which the ROMANS could look
for, was the de&s;potic power of the CAESAR$. Such
are the effects of democracy without a repre&s;enta|tive.</P>
<P>A NOBILITY may po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole, or any part
of the legi&s;lative power of a &s;tate, in two different
ways. Either every nobleman &s;hares the power as
part of the whole body, or the whole body enjoys
the power as compo&s;ed of parts, which have each
a di&s;tinct power and authority. The VENETIAN ari|&s;tocracy
is an in&s;tance of the fir&s;t kind of govern|ment:
The POLISH of the &s;econd. In the VENE|TIAN
government the whole body of nobility po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
the whole power, and no nobleman has any
authority which he receives not from the whole.
In the POLISH government every nobleman, by
means of his fiefs, has a peculiar hereditary autho|rity
over his va&s;&s;als, and the whole body has no
authority but what it receives from the concurrence
of its parts. The di&s;tinct operations and tendencies
of the&s;e two &s;pecies of government might be made
mo&s;t apparent even <HI>a priori.</HI> A VENETIAN nobility
<PB N="29" REF="31">
is infinitely preferable to a POLISH, let the humours
and education of men be ever &s;o much varied. A no|bility,
who po&s;&s;e&s;s their power in common, will pre|&s;erve
peace and order, both among them&s;elves, and their
&s;ubjects; and no member can have authority enough
to controul the laws for a moment. The nobles will
pre&s;erve their authority over the people, but with|out
any grievous tyranny, or any breach of private
property; becau&s;e &s;uch a tyrannical government pro|motes
not the intere&s;t of the whole body, however
it may that of &s;ome individuals. There will be a
di&s;tinction of rank between the nobility and people,
but this will be the only di&s;tinction in the &s;tate.
The whole nobility will form one body, and the
whole people another, without any of tho&s;e private
feuds and animo&s;ities, which &s;pread ruin and de&s;ola|tion
every where. 'Tis ea&s;y to &s;ee the di&s;advan|tages
of a POLISH nobility in every one of the&s;e
particulars.</P>
<P>'Tis po&s;&s;ible &s;o to con&s;titute a free government,
as that a &s;ingle per&s;on, call him duke, prince, or
king, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s a very large &s;hare of power, and
&s;hall form a proper balance or counterpoi&s;e to the
other parts of the legi&s;lature. This chief magi&s;trate
may be either <HI>elective</HI> or <HI>hereditary;</HI> and though the
former in&s;titution may, to a &s;uperficial view, appear
the mo&s;t advantageous; yet a more accurate in&s;pec|tion
will di&s;cover in it greater inconveniencies than
<PB N="30" REF="32">
in the latter, and &s;uch as are &s;ounded on cau&s;es and
principles eternal and immutable. The filling of the
throne, in &s;uch a government, is a point of too great
and too general intere&s;t, not to divide the whole people
into factions: From whence a civil war, the greate&s;t
of ills, may be apprehended, almo&s;t with certainty,
upon very vacancy. The prince elected mu&s;t be
either a <HI>Foreigner</HI> or a <HI>Native:</HI> The former will be
ignorant of the people whom he is to govern; &s;u&s;|picious
of his new &s;ubjects, and &s;u&s;pected by them;
giving his confidence entirely to &s;trangers, who will
have no other care but of enriching them&s;clves in
the quicke&s;t manner, while their ma&s;ter's favour and
authority are able to &s;upport them. A native will
carry into the throne all his private animo&s;ities and
friend&s;hips, and will never be regarded, in his ele|vation,
without exciting the &s;entiments of envy in
tho&s;e, who formerly con&s;idered him as their equal.
Not to mention, that a crown is too high a reward
ever to be given to merit alone, and will always
induce the candidates to employ force, or money,
or intrigue, to procure the votes of the electors: SO
that &s;uch an election will give no better chance for
&s;uperior merit in the prince, than if the &s;tate had
tru&s;ted to birth alone for determining their &s;overeign.</P>
<P>IT may therefore be pronounced as an univer&s;al
axiom in politics, <HI>That an hereditary prince, a nobi|lity
without va&s;&s;als, and a people voting by their re|pre&s;entatives
<PB N="31" REF="33">
form the be&s;t</HI> MONARCHY, ARISTO|CRACY,
<HI>and</HI> DEMOCRACY. But in order to prove
more fully, that politics admit of general truths, which
are invariable by the humor or education either of
&s;ubject or &s;overeign, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve
fome other principles of this &s;cience, which may &s;eem
to de&s;erve that character.</P>
<P>IT may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved, that though free go|vernments
have been commonly the mo&s;t happy for
tho&s;e who partake of their freedom; yet are they
the mo&s;t ruinous and oppre&s;&s;ive to their provinces:
And this ob&s;ervation may, I believe, be fixed as a
maxim of the kind we are here &s;peaking of. When
a monarch extends his dominions by conque&s;t, he
&s;oon learns to con&s;ider his old and his new $u$|jects
as on the &s;ame footing; becau&s;e, in reality,
all his &s;ubjects are to him the &s;ame, except the few
friends and favourites, with whom he is per&s;onally
acquainted. He does not, therefore, make any di&s;|tinction
betwixt them in his <HI>general</HI> laws; and, at
the &s;ame time, is no le&s;s careful to prevent all <HI>par|ticular</HI>
acts of oppre&s;&s;ion on the one as on the other.
But a free &s;tate ncce&s;&s;arily makes a great di&s;tinction
and mu&s;t always do &s;o, till men learn to love their
neighbours as well as them&s;elves. The conquerors,
in &s;uch a government, are all legi&s;lators, and will
be &s;ure &s;o to contrive matters, by re&s;trictions of trade,
and by taxes, as to draw &s;ome private, as well as
<PB N="32" REF="34">
public, advantage from their conque&s;ts. Provincial
governors have al&s;o a better chance in a republic,
to e&s;cape with their plunder, by means of bribery
or intere&s;t, and their fellow-citizens, who find their
own &s;tate to be inriched by the &s;poils of the &s;ub|ject-provinces,
will be the more inclined to tole|rate
&s;uch abu&s;es. Not to mention, that it is a ne|ce&s;&s;ary
precaution in a free &s;tate to change the go|vernors
frequently; which obliges the&s;e temporary
tyrants to be more expeditious and rapacious, that
they may accumulate &s;ufficient wealth before they
give place to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors. What cruel tyrants
were the ROMANS over the world during the time
of their commonwealth! 'Tis true, they had laws
to prevent oppre&s;&s;ion in their provincial magi&s;trates;
but CICERO informs us, that the ROMANS could
not better con&s;ult the intere&s;t of the provinces than
by repealing the&s;e very laws. For, in that ca&s;e,
&s;ays he, our magi&s;trates, having intire impunity,
would plunder no more than would &s;atis&s;y their
own rapaciou&s;ne&s;s: Whereas, at pre&s;ent, they mu&s;t
al&s;o &s;atisfy that of their judges, and of all the great
men of ROME, who&s;e protection they &s;tand in need
of. Who can read of the cruelties and oppre&s;&s;ions
of VERRES without horror and a&s;toni&s;hment? And
who is not touched with indignation to hear, that
after CICERO had exhau&s;ted on that abandoned cri|minal
all the thunders of his eloquence, and had
prevailed &s;o far as to get him condemned to the
<PB N="33" REF="35">
utmo&s;t extent of the laws; yet that cruel tyrant
lived peaceably to old age, in opulence and ea&s;e,
and, thirty years afterward, was put into the pro|&s;cription
by MARK ANTHONY, on account of his
exorbitant wealth, where he fell, with CICERO him|&s;elf,
and all the mo&s;t virtuous men of ROME? After
the di&s;&s;olution of the commonwealth, the ROMAN
yoke became ea&s;ier upon the provinces, as TACI|TUS
informs us<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Ann. lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>; and it may be ob&s;erved, that
many of the wor&s;t emperors, DOMITIAN<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">SUET. in vita DOMIT.</NOTE>, for in|&s;tance,

to modern times, we &s;hall always find the ob|&s;ervation
to hold. The provinces of ab&s;olute mo|narchies

IRELAND, and you will be convinced of this truth;

people from ENGLAND, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;o many rights

better treatment than that of a conquered province.
CORSICA is al&s;o an obvious in&s;tance to the &s;ame
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THERE is an ob&s;ervation of MACHIAVEL, with
regard to the conque&s;ts of ALEXANDER the Great,
which, I think, may be regarded as one of tho&s;e eter|nal
political truths which no time nor accidents can
vary. It may &s;eem &s;trange, &s;ays that politician, that
&s;uch &s;udden conque&s;ts, as tho&s;e of ALEXANDER, &s;hould
be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o peaceably by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, and that
the PERSIANS, during all the confu&s;ions and civil
wars of the GREEKS, never made the &s;malle&s;t efforts
towards the recovery of their former independent go|vernment.
To &s;atisfy us concerning the cau&s;e of this
remarkable event, we may con&s;ider, that a monarch
may govern his &s;ubjects in two different ways. He may
either follow the maxims of the ea&s;tern princes, and
&s;tretch his power &s;o far as to leave no di&s;tinction of
ranks among his &s;ubjects, but what proceeds imme|diately
from him&s;elf; no advantages of birth; no
<PB N="35" REF="37">
hereditary honours and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and, in a word,
no credit among the people, except from his com|mi&s;&s;ion
alone. Or a monarch may exert his power
after a milder manner, like our EUROPEAN princes;
and leave other &s;ources of honour, be&s;ide his &s;mile
and favour: Birth, titles, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, valour, integri|ty,
knowledge, or great and fortunate atchievements.
In the former &s;pecies of government, after a conque&s;t,
'tis impo&s;&s;ible ever to &s;hake off the yoke; &s;ince no
one po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, among the people, &s;o much per&s;onal
credit and authority as to begin &s;uch an enterprize:
Whereas, in the latter, the lea&s;t misfortune, or di&s;|cord
of the victors, will encourage the vanqui&s;hed
to take arms, who have leaders ready to prompt and
conduct them in every undertaking<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I HAVE taken it for granted, according to the &s;uppo&s;ition of MACHIAVEL, that the antient PERSIANS had no nobi|lity; tho' there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the FLORENTINE &s;ecretary, who &s;eems to have been better acquainted with the ROMAN than the GREEK authors, was mi&s;taken in this parti|cular.

wi&s;h he had not mixed fal&s;hood with truth, in a&s;|&s;erting,
that monarchies governed according to the

<P>LEGISLATORS, therefore, ought not to tru&s;t the

Effects will always corre&s;pond to cau&s;es; and
wi&s;e regulations in any commonwealth, are the mo&s;t
valuable legacy which can be left to future ages.
In the &s;malle&s;t court or office, the &s;tated forms and

the &s;ame in public affairs? Can we a&s;cribe the &s;ta|bility
and wi&s;dom of the VENETIAN government,
through &s;o many ages, to any thing but the form
of government? And is it not ea&s;y to point out tho&s;e
defects in the original con&s;titution, which produced
the tumultuous governments of ATHENS and ROME,
and ended at la&s;t in the ruin of the&s;e two famous

on the humours and education of particular men,
that one part of the &s;ame republic may be wi&s;ely
conducted, and another weakly, by the very &s;ame
men, merely on account of the difference of the forms
and in&s;titutions, by which the&s;e parts are regulated.
Hi&s;torians inform us that this was actually the ca&s;e

of &s;edition, and tumult, and di&s;order, the bank of

The ages of greate&s;t public &s;pirit are not always
mo&s;t eminent for private virtue. Good laws may
beget order and moderation in the government, where
the manners and cu&s;toms have in&s;tilled little huma|nity
or ju&s;tice into the tempers of men. The mo&s;t
illu&s;trious period of the ROMAN hi&s;tory, con&s;idered

between the nobility and people being then
fixed by the conte&s;ts of the tribunes, and not being
yet lo&s;t by the extent of conque&s;ts. Yet at this very

that, during part of a &s;ea&s;on, a <HI>Praetor</HI> puni&s;h|ed

<P>HERE, then, is a &s;ufficient inducement to maintain,
with the utmo&s;t ZEAL, in every free &s;tate, tho&s;e forms
and in&s;titutions by which liberty is &s;ecured, the pub|lic
good con&s;ulted, and the avarice or ambition of
particular men re&s;trained and puni&s;hed. Nothing
does more honour to human nature, than to &s;ee it
&s;u&s;ceptible of &s;o noble a pa&s;&s;ion; as nothing can be a
greater indication of meanne&s;s of heart in any man,
than to &s;ee him devoid of it. A man who loves only
him&s;elf, without regard to friend&s;hip or merit, is a
dete&s;table mon&s;ter; and a man, who is only &s;u&s;cep|tible
of friend&s;hip, without public &s;pirit, or a regard
to the community, is deficient in the mo&s;t material
part of virtue.</P>
<P>BUT this is a &s;ubject which needs not be longer in|&s;i&s;ted

both &s;ides who kindle up the pa&s;&s;ions of their parti|zans,
and under the pretence of public good, pur&s;ue
the intere&s;ts and ends of their particular faction. For
my part, I &s;hall always be more fond of promoting
<PB N="41" REF="43">
moderation than zeal; tho' perhaps the &s;ure&s;t way
of producing moderation in every party is to increa&s;e
our zeal for the public. Let us therefore try, if it be
po&s;&s;ible, from the foregoing doctrine, to draw a le&s;&s;on
of moderation with regard to the parties into which
our country is at pre&s;ent<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In 1742.</NOTE> divided; at the &s;ame time,
that we allow not this moderation to abate the indu&s;try
and pa&s;&s;ion with which every individual is bound to
pur&s;ue the good of his country.</P>
<P>THOSE who either attack or defend a mini&s;ter in
&s;uch a government as ours, where the utmo&s;t liberty
is allowed, always carry matters to an extreme, and
exaggerate his merit or demerit with regard to the pub|lic.
His enemies are &s;ure to charge him with the
greate&s;t enormities, both in dome&s;tic and foreign ma|nagement;
and there is no meanne&s;s nor crime, of
which, in their account, he is not capable. Unne|ce&s;&s;ary
wars, &s;candalous treaties, profu&s;ion of public
trea&s;ure, oppre&s;&s;ive taxes, every kind of mal-admini|&s;tration
is a&s;cribed to him. To aggravate the charge,
his pernicious conduct, it is &s;aid, will extend its bane|ful
influence even to po&s;terity, by undermining the
be&s;t con&s;titution in the world, and di&s;ordering that
wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of laws, in&s;titutions and cu&s;toms, by which
our ance&s;tors, for &s;o many centuries, have been &s;o
happily governed. He is not only a wicked mini&s;ter
<PB N="42" REF="44">
in him&s;elf, but has removed every &s;ecurity provided
again&s;t wicked mini&s;ters for the future.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the partizans of the mini&s;ter
make his panegyric run as high as the accu&s;ation
again&s;t him, and celebrate his wi&s;e, &s;teady and mo|derate
conduct in every part of his admini&s;tration.
The honour and intere&s;t of the nation &s;upported
abroad, public credit maintained at home, per&s;ecution
re&s;trained, faction &s;ubdued; the merit of all the&s;e
ble&s;&s;ings is a&s;cribed &s;olely to the mini&s;ter. At the
&s;ame time he crowns all his other merits, by a reli|gious
care of the be&s;t con&s;titution in the world, which
he has pre&s;erved in all its parts, and has tran&s;mitted
entire, to be the happine&s;s and &s;ecurity of the late&s;t
po&s;terity.</P>
<P>WHEN this accu&s;ation and panegyric are received
by the partizans of each party, no wonder they be|get
a mo&s;t extraordinary ferment on both &s;ides, and
fill the nation with the mo&s;t violent animo&s;ities. But
I would fain per&s;uade the&s;e party-zealots, that there
is a fiat contradiction both in the accu&s;ation and pane|gyric,
and that it were impo&s;&s;ible for either of them
to run &s;o high, were it not for this contradiction. If
our con&s;titution be really <HI>that noble fabric, the pride
of</HI> BRITAIN, <HI>the envy of our neighbours, rai&s;ed by the
labour of &s;o many centuries, repaired at the expence of &s;o

I &s;ay, if our con&s;titution does in any degree de&s;erve

of twenty years, when oppo&s;ed by the greate&s;t ge|niu&s;es
of the nation, who exerci&s;ed the utmo&s;t liberty
of tongue and pen, in parliament, and in their fre|quent
appeals to the people. But, if the mini&s;ter be
wicked and weak, to the degree &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted
on, the con&s;titution mu&s;t be faulty in its original prin|ciples,
and he cannot con&s;i&s;tently be charged with
undermining the be&s;t con&s;titution in the world. A
con&s;titution is only &s;o far good, as it provides a reme|dy

<P>Sir <HI>ROBERT WALPOLE,</HI> prime mini&s;ter of GREAT BRITAIN, is a man of ability, not a genius; good-natured, not virtuous; con&s;tant, not magnanimous; moderate, not equi|table<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Moderate in the exerci&s;e of power, not equitable in engro&s;&s;ing it.</NOTE>. His virtues, in &s;ome in&s;tances, are free from the al|lay of tho&s;e vices, which u&s;ually accompany &s;uch virtues: He is a generous friend, without being a bitter enemy. His vices, in other in&s;tances, are not compen&s;ated by tho&s;e virtues which are nearly allyed to them: His want of enterpri&s;e is not attended with frugality. The private character of the man is better than the public: His virtues more than his vices: HIs fortune great|er than his fame. With many good qualities he has incurred the public hatred: With good capacity he has not e&s;caped ridicule. He would have been e&s;teemed more worthy of his high &s;tation, had he $ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it; and is better qualified for the &s;econd than for the fir&s;t place in any government. His mini&s;try has been more advantageous to his family than to the public, better for this age than for po&s;terity, and more pernicious by bad precedents than by real grievances. During his time trade has flouri&s;hed, liberty declined, and learning gone to ruin. As I am a man, I love him; as I am a &s;cholar, I hate him; as I am a BRITON, I calmly wi&s;h his fall.

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the FIRST PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is more &s;urprizing to tho&s;e, who
con&s;ider human affairs with a philo&s;ophical
eye, than to &s;ee the ea&s;ine&s;s with which the many are
governed by the few; and to ob&s;erve the implicit
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion with which men re&s;ign their own &s;enti|ments
and pa&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e of their rulers. When
we enquire by what means this wonder is brought
about, we &s;hall find, that as FORCE is always on the
&s;ide of the governed, the governors have nothing to
&s;upport them but opinion. 'Tis therefore, on opinion
only that government is founded; and this maxim
extends to the mo&s;t de&s;potic and mo&s;t military govern|ments,
as well as to the mo&s;t free and mo&s;t popular.
The &s;oldan of AEGYPT, or the emperor of ROME;
might drive his harmle&s;s &s;ubjects, like brute bea&s;ts,
again&s;t their &s;entiments and inclination: But he mu&s;t,
at lea&s;t, have led his <HI>mamalukes,</HI> or <HI>praetorian bands,</HI>
like men, by their opinion.</P>
<P>OPINION is of two kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> opinion of INTE|REST,
and opinion of RIGHT. By opinion of inte|re&s;t,
<PB N="48" REF="50">
I chiefly under&s;tand the &s;en&s;e of the public ad|vantage
which is reaped from government; together
with the per&s;ua&s;ion, that the particular government,
which is e&s;tabli&s;hed, is equally advantageous with any
other that could ea&s;ily be &s;ettled. When this opinion
prevails among the generality of a &s;tate, or among
tho&s;e who have the force in their hands, it gives great
&s;ecurity to any government.</P>
<P>RIGHT is of two kinds, right to POWER and right
to PROPERTY. What prevalence opinion of the fir&s;t
kind has over mankind, may ea&s;ily be under&s;tood by
ob&s;erving the attachment which all nations have to
their ancient government, and even to tho&s;e names
which have had the &s;anction of antiquity. Antiquity
always begets the opinion of right; and whatever
di&s;advantageous &s;entiments we may entertain of man|kind,
they are always found to be prodigal both of
blood and trea&s;ure in the maintenance of public ju&s;|tice.
This pa&s;&s;ion we may denominate enthu&s;ia&s;m,
or we may give it what appellation we plea&s;e; but
a politician, who &s;hould overlook its influence on
human affairs, would prove him&s;elf but of a very
limited under&s;tanding. <HI>There is,</HI> indeed, no parti|cular,
in which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, there may appear a
greater contradiction in the frame of the human mind
than the pre&s;ent. When men act in a faction, they
are apt, without any &s;hame or remor&s;e, to neglect
all the ties of honour and morality, in order to &s;erve
<PB N="49" REF="51">
their party; and yet, when a faction is formed upon
a point of right or principle, there is no occa&s;ion,
where men di&s;cover a greater ob&s;tinacy, and a more
determined &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice and equity. The &s;ame
&s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition of mankind is the cau&s;e of both the&s;e
contradictory appearances.</P>
<P>'Tis &s;ufficiently under&s;tood, that the opinion of
right to property is of the greate&s;t moment in all mat|ters
of government. A noted author has made pro|perty
the foundation of all government; and mo&s;t of
our political writers &s;eem inclined to follow him in
that particular. This is carrying the matter too far;
but &s;till it mu&s;t be owned, that the opinion of right
to property has a great influence in this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e three opinions, therefore, of public
<HI>intere&s;t,</HI> of <HI>right to power,</HI> and of <HI>right to property,</HI> are
all governments founded, and all authority of the few
over the many. There are indeed other principles,
which add force to the&s;e, and determine, limit, or
alter their operation; &s;uch as <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t, fear,</HI> and
<HI>affection:</HI> But &s;till we may a&s;&s;ert; that the&s;e other
principles can have no influence alone, but &s;uppo&s;e
the antecedent influence of tho&s;e opinions above-mentioned.
They are, therefore, to be e&s;teemed the
&s;econdary, not the original principles of government.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="52">
FOR, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> as to <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t,</HI> by which I mean the
expectation of particular rewards, di&s;tinct from the
general protection which we receive from govern|ment,
'tis evident that the magi&s;trate's authority mu&s;t
be antecedently e&s;tabli&s;hed, or, at lea&s;t be hoped for,
in order to produce this expectation. The pro&s;pect
of reward may augment the authority with regard to
&s;ome particular per&s;ons; but can never give birth to
it, with regard to the public. Men naturally look
for the greate&s;t favours from their friends and acquain|tance;
and therefore, the hopes of any con&s;iderable
number of the &s;tate, would never center in any par|ticular
&s;et of men, if the&s;e men had no other title to
magi&s;tracy, and had no &s;eparate influence over the
opinions of mankind. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be
extended to the other two principles of <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>af|fection.</HI>
No man would have any rea&s;on to <HI>fear</HI> the
fury of a tyrant, if he had no authority over any but
from fear; &s;ince, as a &s;ingle man, his bodily force
can reach but a &s;mall way, and all farther power he
pro&s;&s;e&s;&s;es mu&s;t be founded either on our own opinion,
or on the pre&s;umed opinion of others. And tho' <HI>af|fection</HI>
to wi&s;dom and virtue in a <HI>&s;overeign</HI> extends
very far, and has great influence; yet he mu&s;t be an|tecedently
&s;uppo&s;ed inve&s;ted with a public character,
otherwi&s;e the public e&s;teem will &s;erve him in no &s;tead,
nor will his virtue have any influence beyond a nar|row
&s;phere.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="53">
A GOVERNMENT may endure for &s;everal ages,
tho' the balance of power, and the balance of pro|perty
do not agree. This chiefly happens, where
any rank or order of the &s;tate has acquired a large
&s;hare of the property; but, from the original con&s;ti|tution
of the government, has no &s;hare of the power.
Under what pretext would any individual of that
order a&s;&s;ume authority in public affairs? As men
are commonly much attached to their ancient govern|ment,
it is not to be expected, that the public would
ever favour &s;uch u&s;urpations. But where the original
con&s;titution allows any &s;hare of power, tho' &s;mall, to
an order of men, who po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare of the
property, 'tis ea&s;y for them gradually to &s;tretch their
authority, and bring the balance of power to coin|cide
with that of property. This has been the ca&s;e
with the hou&s;e of commons in ENGLAND.</P>
<P>MOST writers, who have treated of the BRITISH
government, have &s;uppo&s;ed, that as the hou&s;e of com|mons
repre&s;ents all the commons of GREAT BRI|TAIN;
&s;o its weight in the &s;cale is proportioned
to the property and power of all whom it repre&s;ents.
But this principle mu&s;t not be received as ab&s;olutely
true. For tho' the people are apt to attach them&s;elves
more to the hou&s;e of commons, than to any other
member of the con&s;titution; that hou&s;e being cho&s;en
by them as their repre&s;entatives, and as the public
guardians of their liberty; yet are there in&s;tances
<PB N="52" REF="54">
where the hou&s;e, even when in oppo&s;ition to the
crown, has not been followed by the people; as we
may particularly ob&s;erve of the <HI>tory</HI> hou&s;e of com|mons
in the reign of king WILLIAM. Were the
members of the hou&s;e obliged to receive in&s;tructions
from their con&s;tituents, like the DUTCH deputies,
this would entirely alter the ca&s;e; and, if &s;uch im|men&s;e
power and riches, as tho&s;e of the whole com|mons
of BRITAIN, were brought into the &s;cale, 'tis
not ea&s;y to conceive, that the crown could either in|fluence
that multitude of people, or with&s;tand that
overbalance of propety&punc; 'Tis true, the crown has
great influence over the collective body of BRITAIN
in the elections of members; but were this influence
which at pre&s;ent is only exerted once in &s;even years,
to be employed in bringing over the people to every
vote, it would &s;oon be wa&s;ted; and no &s;kill, popu|larity
or revenue, could &s;upport it. I mu&s;t, there|fore,
be of opinion, that an alterations, in this parti|cular,
would introduce a total alteration in our go|vernment,
and would &s;oon reduce it to a pure repub|lic;
and, perhaps, to a republic of no inconvenient
form. For tho' the people collected in a body like
the ROMAN tribes, be quite unfit for government, yet
when di&s;per&s;ed in &s;mall bodies, they are more &s;u&s;cep|tible
both of rea&s;on and order; the force of popular
currents and tides is, in a great mea&s;ure, broke; and
the public intere&s;t may be pur&s;ued with &s;ome method
<PB N="53" REF="55">
and con&s;tancy. But 'tis needle&s;s to rea&s;on any farther
concerning a form of government, which is never
likely to have place in BRITAIN, and which &s;eems
not to be the aim of any party among&s;t us. Let us
cheri&s;h and improve our ancient government as much
as po&s;&s;ible, without encouraging a pa&s;&s;ion for &s;uch
dangerous novelties.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that
the pre&s;ent political controver&s;y, with regard to <HI>in|&s;tructions,</HI>
is a very frivolous one, and can never be
brought to any deci&s;ion, as it is managed by both
parties. The country party pretend not, that a mem|ber
is ab&s;olutely bound to follow in&s;tructions, as an
amba&s;&s;ador or general is confined by his orders, and
that his vote is not to be received in the hou&s;e, but
&s;o far as it is conformable to them. The court|party
again, pretend not, that the &s;entiments of the
people ought to have no weight with each member;
much le&s;s that he ought to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;entiments of
tho&s;e he repre&s;ents, and with whom he is more par|ticularly
connected. And if their &s;entiments be of
weight, why ought they not to expre&s;s the&s;e &s;enti|ments?
The que&s;tion, then, is only concerning the
degrees of weight which ought to be placed on in|&s;tructions.
But &s;uch is the nature of language, that
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for it to expre&s;s di&s;tinctly the&s;e different
degrees; and if men will carry on a controver&s;y on
<PB N="54" REF="56">
this head, it may well happen, that they differ in
their language, and yet agree in their &s;entiments; or
differ in their &s;entiments, and yet agree in their lan|guage.
Be&s;ides, how is it po&s;&s;ible to fix the&s;e degrees,
con&s;idering the variety of affairs which come before
the hou&s;e, and the variety of places which members
repre&s;ent? Ought the in&s;tructions of TOTNESS to
have the &s;ame weight with tho&s;e of LONDON? or in|&s;tructions,
with regard to the <HI>Convention,</HI> which re|&s;pected
foreign politics, to have the &s;ame weight as
tho&s;e with regard to the <HI>exci&s;e,</HI> which re&s;pected only
our dome&s;tic affairs?</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of LOVE and MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>I KNOW not whence it proceeds, that women
are &s;o apt to take ami&s;s every thing which is &s;aid
in di&s;paragement of the married &s;tate; and always
con&s;ider a &s;atyr upon matrimony as a &s;atyr upon
them&s;elves. Do they mean, that they are the parties
principally concerned, and that if a backwardne&s;s to
enter into that &s;tate &s;hould prevail in the world, they
would be the greate&s;t &s;ufferers? Or, are they &s;en&s;ible,
that the misfortunes and mi&s;carriages of the married
&s;tate are owing more to their &s;ex than to ours? I
hope they do not intend to confe&s;s either of the&s;e two
particulars, or to give &s;uch an advantage to their ad|ver&s;aries,
the men, as even to allow them to &s;u&s;pect
it.</P>
<P>I HAVE often had thoughts of complying with this
humour of the fair &s;ex, and of writing a panegyric
upon marriage: But, in looking around for mate|rials,
they &s;eemed to be of &s;o mixed a nature, that at
<PB N="56" REF="58">
the conclu&s;ion of my reflections, I found that I was as
much di&s;po&s;ed to write a &s;atyr, which might be pla|ced
on the oppo&s;ite pages of the panegyric: And I
am afraid, that as &s;atyr is, on mo&s;t occa&s;ions, thought
to contain more truth than panegyric, I &s;hould have
done their cau&s;e more harm than good by this expe|dient.
To mi&s;repre&s;ent facts is what, I know, they
will not require of me. I mu&s;t be more a friend to
truth, than even to them, where their intere&s;ts are
oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>I SHALL tell the women what it is our &s;ex com|plains
of mo&s;t in the married &s;tate; and if they be
di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atisfy us in this particular, all the other
differences will ea&s;ily be accommodated. If I be not
mi&s;taken, 'tis their love of dominion, which is the
ground of the quarrel; tho' 'tis very likely, that they
will think it an unrea&s;onable love of it in us, which
makes us in&s;i&s;t &s;o much upon that point $&punc; However
this may be, no pa&s;&s;ion &s;eems to have more influence
on female minds, than this for power; and there is a
remarkable in&s;tance in hi&s;tory of its prevailing above
another pa&s;&s;ion, which is the only one that can be
&s;uppo&s;ed a proper counterpoi&s;e for it. We are told
that all the women in SCYTHIA once con&s;pired again&s;t
the men, and kept the &s;ecret &s;o well, that they exe|cuted
their de&s;ign before they were &s;u&s;pected. They
&s;urpri&s;ed the men in drink, or a&s;leep; bound them
all fa&s;t in chains; and having called a &s;olemn coun|cil
<PB N="57" REF="59">
of the whole &s;ex, it was debated what expedient
&s;hould be u&s;ed to improve the pre&s;ent advantage, and
prevent their falling again into &s;lavery. To kill all
the men did not &s;eem to the reli&s;h of any part of the
a&s;&s;embly, notwith&s;tanding the injuries formerly re|ceived;
and they were afterwards plea&s;ed to make a
great merit of this lenity of theirs. It was, therefore,
agreed to put out the eyes of the whole male &s;ex, and
thereby re&s;ign in all future time the vanity which
they could draw from their beauty, in order to &s;ecure
their authority. We mu&s;t no longer pretend to dre&s;s
and &s;how, &s;ay they; but then we &s;hall be free from
&s;lavery. We &s;hall hear no more tender &s;ighs; but in
return we &s;hall hear no more imperious commands.
Love mu&s;t for ever leave us; but he will carry &s;ub|jection
along with him.</P>
<P>'TIS regarded by &s;ome as an unlucky circum&s;tance,
&s;ince&punc; the women were re&s;olved to maim the men, and
deprive them of &s;ome of their &s;en&s;es, in order to ren|der
them humble and dependent, that the &s;en&s;e of
hearing could not &s;erve their purpo&s;e, &s;ince 'tis pro|bable
the females would rather have attacked that
than the &s;ight: And I think it is agreed among the
learned, that, in a married &s;tate, 'tis not near &s;o great
an inconvenience to lo&s;e the former &s;en&s;e as the latter.
However this may be, we are told by modern anec|dotes,
that &s;ome of the SCYTHIAN women did &s;e|cretly
&s;pare their hu&s;band's eyes; pre&s;uming, I &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="58" REF="60">
that they could govern them as well by means
of that &s;en&s;e as without it. But &s;o incorrigible and
untractable were the&s;e men, that their wives were all
obliged, in a few years, as their youth and beauty de|cayed,
to imitate the example of their &s;i&s;ters; which
it was no difficult matter to do in a &s;tate where the
female &s;ex had once got the &s;uperiority.</P>
<P>I KNOW not if our SCOTTISH ladies derive any
thing of this humour from their SCYTHIAN ance&s;|tors;
but, I mu&s;t confe&s;s that I have often been &s;ur|prized
to &s;ee a woman very well plea&s;ed to take a fool
for her mate, that &s;he might govern with the le&s;s con|troul;
and could not but think her &s;entiments, in this
re&s;pect, &s;till more barbarous than tho&s;e of the SCY|THIAN
women above-mentioned; as much as the
eyes of the under&s;tanding are more valuable than
tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>BUT to be ju&s;t, and to lay the blame more equally,
I am afraid it is the fault of our &s;ex, if the women be
&s;o fond of rule, and that if we did not abu&s;e our au|thority,
they would never think it worth while to
di&s;pute it. Tyrants, we know, produce rebels; and
all hi&s;tory informs us, that rebels, when they prevail,
are apt to become tyrants in their turn. For this rea|&s;on,
I could wi&s;h there were no preten&s;ions to autho|rity
on either &s;ide; but that every thing was carried
on with perfect equality, as between two equal mem|bers
<PB N="59" REF="61">
of the &s;ame body. And to induce both parties
to embrace tho&s;e amicable &s;entiments, I &s;hall deliver
to them PLATO's account of the origin of love and
marriage.</P>
<P>MANKIND, according to that fanciful philo&s;opher,
were not, in their original, divided into male and fe|male,
as at pre&s;ent; but each individual per&s;on was
a compound of both &s;exes, and was in him&s;elf both
hu&s;band and wife, melted down into one living crea|ture.
This union, no doubt, was very intire, and the
parts very well adju&s;ted together, &s;ince there re&s;ulted
a perfect harmony betwixt the male and female, al|tho'
they were obliged to be in&s;eparable companions.
And &s;o great were the harmony and happine&s;s flowing
from it, that the ANDROGYNES (for &s;o PLATO calls
them) or MEN-WOMEN, became in&s;olent upon their
pro&s;perity, and rebelled again&s;t the Gods. To pu|ni&s;h
them for this temerity, JUPITER could contrive
no better expedient, than to divorce the male-part
from the female, and make two imperfect beings of
the compound, which was before &s;o perfect. Hence
the origin of men and women, as di&s;tinct creatures.
But notwith&s;tanding this divi&s;ion, &s;o lively is our re|membrance
of the happine&s;s which we enjoyed in
our primaeval &s;tate, that we are never at re&s;t in this
&s;ituation; but each of the&s;e halves is continually
&s;earching thro' the whole &s;pecies to find the other
half, which was broken from it: And when they
<PB N="60" REF="62">
meet, they join again with the greate&s;t fondne&s;s and
&s;ympathy. But it often happens, that they are mi&s;|taken
in this particular; that they take for their half
what no way corre&s;ponds to them; and that the parts
do not meet nor join in with each other, as is u&s;ual
in fractures. In this ca&s;e the union was &s;oon di&s;&s;ol|ved,
and each part is &s;et loo&s;e again to hunt for its
lo&s;t half, joining it&s;elf to every one whom it meets,
by way of trial, and enjoying no re&s;t till its perfect
&s;ympathy with its partner &s;hews, that it has at la&s;t
been &s;ucce&s;sful in its endeavours.</P>
<P>WERE I di&s;po&s;ed to carry on this fiction of PLA|TO,
which accounts for the mutual love betwixt the
&s;exes in &s;o agreeable a manner, I would do it by the
following allegory.</P>
<P>WHEN JUPITER had &s;eparated the male from the
female, and had quelled their pride and ambition by
&s;o &s;evere an operation, he could not but repent him
of the cruelty of his vengeance, and take compa&s;&s;ion
on poor mortals, who were now become incapable of
any repo&s;e or tranquillity. Such cravings, &s;uch anxi|eties,
&s;uch nece&s;&s;ities aro&s;e, as made them cur&s;e their
creation, and think exi&s;tence it&s;elf a puni&s;hment.
In vain had they recour&s;e to every other occupation
and amu&s;ement. In vain did they &s;eek after every
plea&s;ure of &s;en&s;e, and every refinement of rea&s;on.
Nothing could fill that void, which they felt in their
<PB N="61" REF="63">
hearts, or &s;upply the lo&s;s of their partner, who was &s;o
fatally &s;eparated from them. To remedy this di&s;or|der,
and to be&s;tow &s;ome comfort, at lea&s;t, on the hu|man
race in their forlorn &s;ituation, JUPITER &s;ent
down LOVE and HYMEN to collect the broken halves
of human kind, and piece them together in the be&s;t
manner po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e two deities found &s;uch a
prompt di&s;po&s;ition in mankind to unite again in their
primaeval &s;tate, that they proceeded on their work
with wonderful &s;ucce&s;s for &s;ome time; till at la&s;t,
from many unlucky accidents, di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e be|twixt
them. The chief coun&s;ellor and favourite of
HYMEN was CARE, who was continually filling his
patron's head with pro&s;pects of futurity; a &s;ettle|ment,
family, children, &s;ervants; &s;o that little el&s;e
was regarded in all the matches <HI>they</HI> made. On the
other hand, <HI>Love</HI> had cho&s;en PLEASURE for his fa|vourite,
who was as pernicious a coun&s;ellor as the
other, and would never allow <HI>Love</HI> to look beyond
the pre&s;ent momentary gratification, or the &s;tisfying
of the prevailing inclination. The&s;e two favourites
became, in a little time, irreconcileable enemies, and
made it their chief bu&s;ine&s;s to undermine each other
in all their undertaking. No &s;ooner had <HI>Love</HI> fixed
upon two halves, which he was cementing together,
and forming to a clo&s;e union, but <HI>Care</HI> in&s;inuates him|&s;elf,
and bringing HYMEN along with him, di&s;&s;olves
the union produced by love, and joins each half to
&s;ome other half, which he had provided for it. To
<PB N="62" REF="64">
be revenged of this, <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> creeps in upon a pair
already joined by HYMEN; and calling <HI>Love</HI> to his
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they under hand contrive to join each half
by &s;ecret links, to halves, which HYMEN was wholly
u$acquainted with. It was not long before this
quarrel was felt in its pernicious con&s;equences; and
&s;uch complaints aro&s;e before the throne of JUPITER,
that he was obliged to &s;ummon the offending parties
to appear before him, in order to give an account of
their proceedings. After hearing the pleadings on
both &s;ides, he ordered an immediate reconcilement
betwixt <HI>Love</HI> and HYMEN, as the only expedient for
giving happine&s;s to mankind: And that he might
be &s;ure this reconcilement &s;hould be durable, he laid
his &s;trict injunctions on them never to join any halves
without con&s;ulting their favourites <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Plea&s;ure,</HI>
and obtaining the con&s;ent of both to the conjunction.
Where this order is &s;trictly ob&s;erved, the <HI>Androgyne</HI> is
perfectly re&s;tored, and the human race enjoy the &s;ame
happine&s;s as in their primaeval &s;tate. The &s;eam is
&s;carce perceived that joins the two beings; but both
of them combine to form one perfect and happy

<P>THERE is nothing which I would recommend
more earne&s;tly to my female readers than the
&s;tudy of hi&s;tory, as an occupation, of all others, the
be&s;t &s;uited both to their &s;ex and education, much
more in&s;tructive than their ordinary books of amu&s;e|ment,
and more entertaining than tho&s;e &s;erious com|po&s;itions,
which are u&s;ually to be found in their clo|&s;ets.
Among other important truths, which they
may learn from hi&s;tory, they may be informed of
two particulars, the knowledge of which may contri|bute
very much to their quiet and repo&s;e; <HI>That</HI> our
&s;ex, as well as theirs, are far from being &s;uch perfect
creatures as they are apt to imagine, and, <HI>That</HI> Love
is not the only pa&s;&s;ion, which governs the male-world,
but is often overcome by avarice, ambition, vanity,
and a thou&s;and other pa&s;&s;ions. Whether they be the
fal&s;e repre&s;entations of mankind in tho&s;e two parti|culars,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
which endear romances and novels &s;o much to
the fair &s;ex, I know not; but mu&s;t confe&s;s that I am
&s;orry to &s;ee them have &s;uch an aver&s;ion to matter of
fact, and &s;uch an appetite for fal&s;hood. I remember I
was once de&s;ired by a young beauty, for whom I had
&s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, to &s;end her &s;ome novels and romances
for her amu&s;ement in the country; but was not &s;o un|generous
as to take the advantage, which &s;uch a
cour&s;e of reading might have given me, being re&s;ol|ved
not to make u&s;e of poi&s;oned arms again&s;t her. I
therefore &s;ent her PLUTARCH'S lives, a&s;&s;uring her, at
the &s;ame time, that there was not a word of truth in
them from beginning to end. She peru&s;ed them very
attentively, 'till &s;he came to the lives of ALEXANDER
and CAESAR, who&s;e names &s;he had heard of by acci|dent;
and then returned me the book, with many
reproaches for deceiving her.</P>
<P>I MAY indeed be told, that the fair &s;ex have no
&s;uch aver&s;ion to hi&s;tory, as I have repre&s;ented, provi|ded
it be <HI>&s;ecret</HI> hi&s;tory, and contain &s;ome memorable
tran&s;action proper to excite their curio&s;ity. But as I
do not find that truth, which is the ba&s;is of hi&s;tory, is
at all regarded in tho&s;e anecdotes, I cannot admit of
this as a proof of their pa&s;&s;ion for that &s;tudy. How|ever
this may be, I &s;ee not why the &s;ame curio&s;ity
might not receive a more proper direction, and lead
them to defire accounts of tho&s;e who lived in pa&s;t ages,
as well as of their cotemporaries. What is it to CLE|ORA,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
whether FULVIA entertains a &s;ecret commerce
of <HI>Love</HI> with PHILANDER or not? Has &s;he not
equal rea&s;on to be plea&s;ed, when &s;he is informed
(what is whi&s;pered about among hi&s;torians) that
CATO'S &s;i&s;ter had an intrigue with CAESAR, and
palmed her &s;on, MARCUS BRUTUS, upon her hu&s;|band
for his own, tho' in reality he was her gallant's?
And are not the loves of MESSALINA or JULIA as
proper &s;ubjects of di&s;cour&s;e as any intrigue that this
city has produced of late years?</P>
<P>BUT I know not whence it comes, that I have been
thus &s;educed into a kind of raillery again&s;t the ladies:
Unle&s;s, perhaps, it proceed from the &s;ame cau&s;e,
which makes the per&s;on, who is the favourite of the
company, be often the object of their good-natured
je&s;ts and plea&s;antries. We are plea&s;ed to addre&s;s our|&s;elves
after any manner, to one who is agreeable to
us; and, at the &s;ame time, pre&s;ume, that nothing
will be taken ami&s;s by a per&s;on, who is &s;ecure of the
good opinion and affections of every one pre&s;ent. I
&s;hall now proceed to handle my &s;ubject more &s;eri|ou&s;ly,
and &s;hall point out the many advantages, which
flow from the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory, and &s;how how well
&s;uited it is to every one, but particularly to tho&s;e who
are debarred the &s;everer &s;tudies, by the tenderne&s;s of
their complexion, and the weakne&s;s of their edu|cation.
The advantages found in hi&s;tory &s;eem to be
<PB N="66" REF="68">
of three kinds, as it amu&s;es the fancy, as it improves
the under&s;tanding, and as it &s;trengthens virtue.</P>
<P>IN reality, what more agreeable entertainment to
the mind, than to be tran&s;ported into the remote&s;t
ages of the world, and to ob&s;erve human &s;ociety, in
its infancy, making the fir&s;t faint e&s;&s;ays towards the
arts and &s;ciences: To &s;ee the policy of government,
and the civility of conver&s;ation refining by degrees,
and every thing which is ornamental to human life
advancing towards its perfection. To remark the
ri&s;e, progre&s;s, declen&s;ion, and final extinction of the
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing empires: The virtues, which con|tributed
to their greatne&s;s, and the vices, which drew
on their ruin. In &s;hort, to &s;ee all human race, from
the beginning of time, pa&s;s, as it were, in review be|fore
us; appearing in their true colours, without any
of tho&s;e di&s;gui&s;es, which, during their life-time, &s;o
much perplexed the judgment of the beholders. What
&s;pectacle can be imagined, &s;o magnificent, &s;o various,
&s;o intere&s;ting? What amu&s;ement, either of the &s;en&s;es
or imagination, can be compared with it? Shall tho&s;e
trifling pa&s;times, which engro&s;s &s;o much of our time,
be preferred as more &s;atisfactory, and more fit to en|gage
our attention? How perver&s;e mu&s;t that ta&s;te be,
which is capable of &s;o wrong a choice of plea&s;ures?</P>
<P>BUT hi&s;tory is a mo&s;t improving part of know|ledge,
as well as an agreeable amu&s;ement; and a
<PB N="67" REF="69">
great part of what we commonly call <HI>Erudition,</HI> and
value &s;o highly, is nothing but an acquaintance with
hi&s;torical facts. An exten&s;ive knowledge of this
kind belongs to men of letters; but I mu&s;t think it
an unpardonable ignorance in per&s;ons of whatever
&s;ex or condition, not to be acquainted with the hi&s;|tory
of their own country, together with the hi&s;tories
of ancient GREECE and ROME. A woman may be|have
her&s;elf with good manners, and have even &s;ome
vivacity in her turn of wit; but where her mind is &s;o
unfurni&s;hed, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible her conver&s;ation can af|ford
any entertainment to men of &s;en&s;e and reflection.</P>
<P>I MUST add, that hi&s;tory is not only a valuable
part of knowledge, but opens the door to many
other parts, and affords materials to mo&s;t of the &s;ci|ences.
And indeed, if we con&s;ider the &s;hortne&s;s of
human life, and our limited knowledge, even of what
pa&s;&s;es in our own time, we mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that we
&s;hould be for ever children in under&s;tanding, were it
not for this invention, which extends our experience
to all pa&s;t ages, and to the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations; mak|ing
them contribute as much to our improvement in
wi&s;dom, as if they had actually lain under our ob|&s;ervation.
A man acquainted with hi&s;tory may, in
&s;ome re&s;pect, be &s;aid to have lived from the begin|ning
of the world, and to have been making conti|nual
additions to his &s;tock of knowledge in every
century.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="70">
THERE is al&s;o an advantage in that experience
which is acquired by hi&s;tory, above what is learned
by the practice of the world, that it brings us ac|quainted
with human affairs, without dimini&s;hing in
the lea&s;t from the mo&s;t delicate &s;entiments of virtue.
And, to tell the truth, I know not any &s;tudy or occu|pation
&s;o unexceptionable as hi&s;tory in this particular.
Poets can paint virtue in the mo&s;t charming colours;
but, as they addre&s;s them&s;elves entirely to the pa&s;|&s;ions,
they often become advocates for vice. Even
philo&s;ophers are apt to bewilder them&s;elves in the
&s;ubtilty of their &s;peculations; and we have &s;een &s;ome
go &s;o far as to deny the reality of all moral di&s;tinc|tions.
But I think it a remark worthy the attention
of the &s;peculative, that the hi&s;torians have been, al|mo&s;t
without exception, the true friends of virtue, and
have always repre&s;ented it in its proper colours, how|ever
they may have erred in their judgments of par|ticular
per&s;ons. MACHIAVEL him&s;elf di&s;covers a
true &s;entiment of virtue in his hi&s;tory of FLORENCE.
When he talks as a <HI>Politician,</HI> in his general rea&s;on|ings,
he con&s;iders poi&s;oning, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination and perjury,
as lawful arts of power; but when he &s;peaks as an
<HI>Hi&s;torian,</HI> in his particular narrations, he &s;hows &s;o
keen an indignation again&s;t vice, and &s;o warm an ap|probation
of virtue, in many pa&s;&s;ages, that I could
not forbear applying to him that remark of HORACE,
That if you chace away nature, tho' with ever &s;o
great indignity, &s;he will always return upon you.
<PB N="69" REF="71">
Nor is this combination of hi&s;torians in favour of vir|tue
at all difficult to be accounted for. When a man
of bu&s;ine&s;s enters into life and action, he is more apt
to con&s;ider the characters of men, as they have rela|tion
to his intere&s;t, than as they &s;tand in them&s;elves;
and has his judgment warped on every occa&s;ion by
the violence of his pa&s;&s;ion. When a philo&s;opher con|templates
characters and manners in his clo&s;et, the
general ab&s;tract view of the objects leaves the mind
&s;o cold and unmoved, that the &s;entiments of nature
have no room to play, and he &s;carce feels the differ|ence
between vice and virtue. Hi&s;tory keeps in a
ju&s;t medium betwixt the&s;e extremes, and places the
objects in their true point of view. The writers of
hi&s;tory, as well as the readers, are &s;ufficiently intere&s;t|ed
in the characters and events, to have a lively &s;en|timent
of blame or prai&s;e; and, at the &s;ame time,
have no particular intere&s;t or concern to pervert their
judgment.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the INDEPENDENCY of PARLIAMENT.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently ob&s;erved, in comparing the
conduct of the <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> parties, that the
former are commonly le&s;s a&s;&s;uming and dogmatical
in conver&s;ation, more apt to make conce&s;&s;ions; and
tho' not, perhaps, more &s;u&s;ceptible of conviction, yet
more able to bear contradiction than the latter; who
are apt to fly out upon any oppo&s;ition, and to regard
one as a mercenary de&s;igning fellow, if he argues
with any coolne&s;s and impartiality, or makes any
conce&s;&s;ions to their adver&s;aries. This is a fact, which,
I believe, every one may have ob&s;erved, who has been
much in companies where political que&s;tions have
been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; tho' were one to a&s;k the rea&s;on of
this difference, every party would be apt to a&s;&s;ign a
different one. Gentlemen in the <HI>Oppo&s;ition</HI> will a&s;|cribe
it to the very nature of their party, which,
being founded on public &s;pirit, and a zeal for the
con&s;titution, cannot ea&s;ily endure &s;uch doctrines, as
<PB N="72" REF="73">
are of pernicious con&s;equence to liberty. The cour|tiers,
on the other hand, will be apt to put us in
mind of the clown mentioned by lord SHAFTSBURY.
&startq;A Clown, &s;ays that<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;cellaneous Reflections, p. 107.</NOTE> excellent author, once took
a fancy to hear the <HI>Latin</HI> di&s;putes of doctors at
an univer&s;ity. He was a&s;ked what plea&s;ure he
could take in viewing &s;uch combatants, when he
could never know &s;o much, as which of the parties
had the better. <HI>For that matter,</HI> replied the clown,
<HI>I a'n't &s;uch a fool neither, but I can &s;ee who's the
fir&s;t that puts t'other into a pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> Nature her&s;elf
dictated this le&s;&s;on to the clown, that he who had
the better of the argument would be ea&s;y and well-humoured:
But he who was unable to &s;upport his
cau&s;e by rea&s;on, would naturally lo&s;e his temper,
and grow violent.&endq;</P>
<P>To which of the&s;e rea&s;ons &s;hall we adhere? To
neither of them, in my opinion; unle&s;s we have a
mind to inli&s;t our&s;elves, and become zealots in either
party. I believe I can a&s;&s;ign the rea&s;on of this dif|ferent
conduct of the two parties, without offend|ing
either. The country party are plainly mo&s;t po|pular
at pre&s;ent, and, perhaps, have been &s;o in mo&s;t
admini&s;trations: So that, being accu&s;tomed to pre|vail
in company, they cannot endure to hear their
opinions controverted, but are as confident on the
public favour, as if they were &s;upported in all their
<PB N="73" REF="74">
&s;entiments by the mo&s;t infallible demon&s;ration. The
courtiers, on the other hand, are commonly &s;o run
down by popular talkers, that if you &s;peak to them
with any moderation, or make them the &s;malle&s;t con|ce&s;&s;ions,
they think them&s;elves extremely beholden to
you, and are apt to return the favour by a like mo|deration
and facility on their part. To be furious
and pa&s;&s;ionate, they know, would only gain them
the character of <HI>&s;hamele&s;s mercenaries;</HI> not that of
<HI>zealous patriots,</HI> which is the character that &s;uch a warm
behaviour is apt to acquire to the other party.</P>
<P>IN all controver&s;ies, we find, without regarding
the truth or fal&s;hood on either &s;ide, that tho&s;e who
defend the e&s;tabli&s;hed and popular opinions, are al|ways
the mo&s;t dogmatical and imperious in their
&s;tile: While their adver&s;aries affect a mo&s;t extraor|dinary
gentlene&s;s and moderation, in order to &s;often,
as much as po&s;&s;ible, any prejudices that may lye a|gain&s;t
them. Con&s;ider the behaviour of our <HI>free|thinkers</HI>
of all denominations, whether they be &s;uch
as decry all revelation, or only oppo&s;e the exorbi|tant
power of the clergy; COLLINS, TINDAL, FOS|TER,
HOADLEY. Compare their moderation and
good-manners, with the zeal and even &s;currility of
their adver&s;aries, and you will be convinced of the
truth of my ob&s;ervation. A like difference may be
ob&s;erved in the conduct of tho&s;e FRENCH writers,
who maintained the controver&s;y with regard to an|cient
<PB N="74" REF="75">
and modern learning. BOILEAU, <HI>Mon&s;tieur &amp;
Madame</HI> DACIER, <HI>l'Abbe de</HI> Bos, who defended the
party of the ancients, mixed their rea&s;onings with
&s;atyre and invective: While FONTENELLE, <HI>la</HI> MOT|TE,
CHARPENTIER, and even PERRAULT never
tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the bounds of moderation and good-breed|ing;
tho' provoked by the mo&s;t &s;evere railleries of
their adver&s;aries.</P>
<P>I AM led into this train of reflection, by con&s;der|ing
&s;ome papers wrote upon the grand topic of <HI>court|influence,
and parliamentary dependence,</HI> where, in my
humble opinion, the country party, be&s;ides vehemence
and &s;atye, &s;hew too rigid an inflexibility, and too
great a jealou&s;y of makinig conce&s;&s;ions to their ad|ver&s;ries.
Their rea&s;onings lo&s;e their force, by be|ing
carried too far; and the popularity of their opi|nions
has &s;educed them to neglect, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
their ju&s;tne&s;s and &s;olidity. The following rea&s;oning
will, I hope, &s;erve to ju&s;tify me in this opinion.</P>
<P>POLITICAL writers have e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a maxim,
That in contriving any &s;y&s;tem of government, and
and fixing the &s;everal checks and controuls of the
con&s;titution, every man ought to be &s;uppo&s;ed a <HI>knave,</HI>
and to have no other end, in all his actions, but pri|vate
intere&s;t. By this intere&s;t we mu&s;t govern him,
and, by means of it, make him co-operate to public
good, notwith&s;tanding his in&s;atiable avarice and am|bition.
<PB N="75" REF="76">
Without this, &s;ay they, we &s;hall in vain boa&s;t
of the advantages of any con&s;titution, and &s;hall find,
in the end, that we have no &s;ecurity for our liberties
or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, except the good-will of our rulers;
that is, we &s;hall have no &s;ecurity at all.</P>
<P>'TIS therefore a ju&s;t <HI>political</HI> maxim, <HI>That every
man mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed a knave:</HI> Tho' at the &s;ame time,
it appears &s;omewhat &s;trange, that a maxim &s;hould be
true in <HI>politics,</HI> which is fal&s;e in <HI>fact.</HI> But to &s;atisfy
us on this head, we may con&s;ider, that men are ge|nerally
more hone&s;t in their private than in their
public character, and will go greater lengths to &s;erve
a party, than when their own private intere&s;t is a|lone
concerned. Honour is a great check upon man|kind:
But where a con&s;iderable body of men act to|gether,
this check is, in a great mea&s;ure, removed;
&s;ince a man is &s;ure to be approved of by his own
party, for what promotes the common intere&s;t, and
he &s;oon learns to de&s;pi&s;e the clamours of his adver|&s;aries.
To which we may add, that every court or
&s;enate is determined by the majority; &s;o that, if &s;elf-intere&s;t
influences only the majority, (as it will always
do) the whole &s;enate follows the allurements of this
&s;eparate intere&s;t, and acts as if it contained not one
member, who had any regard to public intere&s;t and
liberty.</P>
<P>WHEN there offers, therefore, to our cen&s;ure, and
examination, any plan of government, real or ima|ginary,
<PB N="76" REF="77">
where the power is di&s;tributed among &s;everal
courts, and &s;everal orders of men, we &s;hould always
con&s;ider the private intere&s;t of each court, and each
order; and, if we find, that, by the &s;kilful divi&s;ion
of the power, the private intere&s;t mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily,
in its operation, concur with the public, we may pro|nounce
that government to be wi&s;e and happy. If,
on the contrary, the private intere&s;t of each order
be not checked, and be not directed to public inte|tere&s;t,
we ought to look for nothing but faction,
di&s;order, and tyranny from &s;uch a government. In
this opinion I am ju&s;tified by experience, as well as
by the authority of all philo&s;ophers and politicians
both antient and modern.</P>
<P>How much, therefore, would it have &s;urprized
&s;uch a genius as CICERO, or TACITUS, to have been
told, That, in a future age, there &s;hould arife a very
regular &s;y&s;tem of <HI>mixt</HI> government, where the autho|rity
was &s;o di&s;tributed, that one rank, whenever it
plea&s;ed, might &s;wallow up all the re&s;t, and engro&s;s
the whole power of the con&s;titution. Such a govern|ment,
they would &s;ay, will not be a mixed government.
For &s;o great is the natural ambition of men, that they
are never &s;atisfied with power; and if one order of
men, by pur&s;uing its own intere&s;t, can u&s;urp upon
every other order, it will certainly do &s;o, and render
it&s;elf, as far as po&s;&s;ible, ab&s;olute and uncontroulable.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="78">
BUT, in this opinion, experience &s;hews they would
have been mi&s;taken. For this is actually the ca&s;e
with the BRITISH con&s;titution. The &s;hare of power
allotted by our con&s;titution to the hou&s;e of commons
is &s;o great, that it ab&s;olutely commands all the other
parts of the government. The king's legi&s;lative
power is plainly no proper check to it. For tho$
the king has a negative in the pa&s;&s;ing of laws; yet
this, in fact, is e&s;teemed of &s;o little moment, that
whatever is voted by the two hou&s;es, is always &s;ure
to be pa&s;&s;ed into a law, and the royal a&s;&s;ent is little
better than a mere form. The principal weight of
the crown lies in the executive power. But be&s;ides
that the executive power, in every government, is
altogether &s;ubordinate to the legi&s;lative; be&s;ides this,
I &s;ay, the exerci&s;e of this power requires an immen&s;e
expence, and the commons have a&s;&s;umed to them|&s;elves
the &s;ole power of di&s;po&s;ing of public money.
How ea&s;y, therefore, would it be for that hou&s;e to
wre&s;t from the crown all the&s;e powers, one after
another, by making every grant of money condi|tional,
and choo&s;ing their time &s;o well, that their
refu&s;al of &s;ub&s;idies &s;hould only di&s;tre&s;s the govern|ment,
without giving foreign powers any advantage
over us? Did the hou&s;e of commons depend in the
&s;ame manner on the king, and had none of the mem|bers
any property but from his gift, would not he
command all their re&s;olutions, and be from that mo|ment

But there is a peculiar difficulty in the pre|&s;ent
ca&s;e, which would embarra&s;s the mo&s;t knowing
and mo&s;t impartial examiner. The power of the
crown is always lodged in a &s;ingle per&s;on, either
king or mini&s;ter; and as this per&s;on may have ei|ther
a greater or le&s;s degree of ambition, capacity,
courage, popularity or fortune, the power, which is
too great in one hand, may become too little in
another. In pure republics, where the power is
di&s;tributed among &s;everal a&s;&s;emblies or &s;enates, the
checks and controuls are more regular in their ope|ration;
becau&s;e the members of &s;uch numerous a&s;|&s;emblies
may be pre&s;umed to be always nearly equal
in capacity and virtue; and 'tis only their number,
riches, or authority, which enter into con&s;ideration.

<P>THOSE who a&s;&s;ert, That the balance of our go|vernment
inclines towards ab&s;olute monarchy, may
&s;upport their opinion by the following rea&s;ons. That
property has a great influence on power cannot po&s;|&s;ibly
be denied; but yet the general maxim, <HI>That the
balance of one depends on the balance of the other,</HI> mu&s;t
be received with &s;everal limitations. 'Tis evident,
that much le&s;s property in a &s;ingle hand will be able
to counter-balance a greater property in &s;everal hands;
not only becau&s;e it is difficult to make many per&s;ons
combine in the &s;ame views and mea&s;ures; but al&s;o be|cau&s;e
property, when united, cau&s;es much greater de|pendance,
than the &s;ame property, when di&s;per&s;ed. An
hundred per&s;ons, of 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a year a-piece, can con&s;ume
all their income, and no body &s;hall ever be the better
for them, except their &s;ervants and trade&s;men, who
ju&s;tly regard their profits as the product of their own
labour. But a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 100,000<HI>l.</HI> a year,
if he has either any genero&s;ity, or any cunning, may
create a great dependance by obligations, and &s;till a
<PB N="85" REF="85">
greater by expectations. Hence we may ob&s;erve, that
in all free governments any &s;ubject exorbitantly rich
has always created a jealou&s;y, even tho' his riches
bore no manner of proportion to the riches of the
&s;tate, CRASSUS'S fortune, if I remember well, a|mounted
only to about<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">As intere&s;t in ROME was higher than with us, this might yield above 100,000 <HI>l.</HI> a year.</NOTE> &s;ixteen hundred thou&s;and
pounds in our money; and yet we find, that, tho' his
genius was nothing extraordinary, he was able, by
means of his riches alone, to counter-balance, during
his life-time, the power of POMPEY as well as that
of CAESAR, who afterwards became ma&s;ter of the
world. The wealth of the MEDICIS made them
ma&s;ters of FLORENCE; tho', 'tis probable, it was
very incon&s;iderable, compared to the united proper|ty
of that opulent republic.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations are apt to make one enter|tain
a very magnificent idea of the BRITISH &s;pirit
and love of liberty; &s;ince we could maintain our free
government, during &s;o many centuries, again&s;t our
&s;overeigns, who, be&s;ides the power and dignity and
maje&s;ty of the crown, have always been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
much more property than any &s;ubject has ever en|joyed
in any commonwealth. But it may be &s;aid,
that this &s;pirit, however great, will never be able to
&s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t that immen&s;e property, which is
<PB N="86" REF="86">
now lodged in the king, and which is &s;till increa&s;ing.
Upon a moderate computation, there are near three
millions at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown. 'The civil li&s;t
amounts to near a million; the collection of all taxes
to another million; and the employments in the army
and navy, together with eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, to
above a third million: An enormous &s;um, and what
may fairly be computed to be more than a thirtieth
part of the whole income and labour of the king|dom.
When we add to this immen&s;e property, the
increa&s;ing luxury of the nation, our pronene&s;s to cor|ruption,
together with the great power and preroga|tives
of the crown, and the command of &s;uch nume|rous
military forces, there is no one but mu&s;t de&s;pair
of being able, without extraordinary efforts, to &s;up|port
our free government much longer under all the&s;e
di&s;advantages.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, tho&s;e who maintain, that the
bya&s;s of the BRITISH government leans towards a re|public,
may &s;upport their opinion by very &s;pecious
arguments. It may be &s;aid, that tho' this immen&s;e
property in the crown, be joined to the dignity of fir&s;t
magi&s;trate, $nd to many other legal powers and pre|rogatives,
which &s;hould naturally give it a greater in|fluence;
yet it really becomes le&s;s dangerous to li|berty
upon that very account. Were BRITAIN a re|public,
and were any private man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a reve|nue,
a third, or even a tenth part as large as that of
<PB N="87" REF="87">
the crown, he would very ju&s;tly excite jealou&s;y; be|cau&s;e
he would infallibly have great authority in the
government: And &s;uch an irregular authority, not
avowed by the laws, is always more dangerous than
a much greater authority, which is derived from them.
A<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On ne monte jamais &s;i $aut que quand on ne &s;&ccedil;ait pas ou on va, &s;aid CROMWELL to the pre&s;ident DE BELLIIVRE. DE RETZ'S Memoirs.</NOTE> man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of u&s;urped power, can &s;et no
bounds to his preten&s;ions: His partizans have liberty
to hope for every thing in his favour: His enemies
provoke his ambition, with his fears, by the violence
of their oppo&s;ition: And the government being
thrown into a ferment, every corrupted humour in
the &s;tate naturally gathers to him. On the contrary,
a legal authority, tho' very great, has always &s;ome
bounds, which terminate both the hopes and preten|&s;ions
of the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it: The laws mu&s;t
have provided a remedy again&s;t its exce&s;&s;es: Such an
eminent magi&s;trate has much to fear, and little to
hope from his u&s;urpations: And as his legal autho|rity
is quietly &s;ubmitted to, he has &s;mall temptation
and &s;mall opportunity of extending it farther. Be|&s;ides,
it happens, with regard to ambitious aims and
projects, what may be ob&s;erved with regard to &s;ects
of philo&s;ophy and religion. A new &s;ect excites &s;uch
a ferment, and is both oppo&s;ed and defended with
&s;uch vehemence, that it &s;preads always fa&s;ter, and
<PB N="88" REF="88">
multiplies its partizans with greater rapidity, than
any old e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, recommended by the
&s;anction of the laws and of antiquity. Such is the
nature of novelty, that where any thing plea&s;es it
becomes doubly agreeable, if new; but if it di&s;|plea&s;es,
it is doubly di&s;plea&s;ing, upon that very ac|count.
And, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, the violence of enemies
is favourable to ambitious projects, as well as the zeal
of partizans.</P>
<P>IT may farther be &s;aid, that tho' men be very
much governed by intere&s;t; yet even intere&s;t it&s;elf,
and all human affairs are entirely governed by <HI>opinion.</HI>
Now, there has been a very &s;udden and a very &s;en|&s;ible
change in the opinions of men within the&s;e la&s;t
fifty years by the progre&s;s of learning and of liberty.
Mo&s;t people, in this i&s;land, have dive&s;ted them&s;elves
of all &s;uper&s;titious reverence to names and authority:
The clergy have much lo&s;t their credit: Their pre|ten&s;ions
and doctrines have been ridiculed; and even
religion can &s;carce &s;upport it&s;elf in the world. The
mere name of <HI>king</HI> commands little re&s;pect; and to
talk of a king as GOD's vicegerent on earth, or to
give him any of tho&s;e magnificent titles, which for|merly
dazzled mankind, would but excite laughter in
every one. Tho' the crown, by means of its large
revenue, may maintain its authority in times of tran|quility,
upon private intere&s;t and influence; yet as
the lea&s;t &s;hock or convul&s;ion mu&s;t break all the&s;e in|tere&s;ts
<PB N="89" REF="89">
to pieces, the kingly power, being no longer
&s;upported by the &s;ettled principles and opinions of
men, will immediately di&s;&s;olve. Had men been in
the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition at the <HI>revolution,</HI> as they are at
pre&s;ent, monarchy would have run a great ri&s;que of
being entirely lo&s;t in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>DURST I venture to deliver my own &s;entiments
amid&s;t the&s;e oppo&s;ite arguments, I would a&s;&s;ert, that
unle&s;s there happen &s;ome extraordinary convul&s;ion, the
power of the crown, by means of its large revenue, is
rather upon the increa&s;e; tho', at the &s;ame time I own,
that its progre&s;s &s;eems very &s;low, and almo&s;t in&s;en|&s;ible.
The tide had run long, and with &s;ome rapi|dity,
to the &s;ide of popular government, and is ju&s;t
beginning to turn towards monarchy.</P>
<P>'TIS well known that every government mu&s;t come
to a period, and that death is unavoidable to the po|litical
as well as to the animal body. But, as one
kind of death may be preferable to another, it may
be enquired, whether it be more de&s;irable for the
BRITISH con&s;titution to terminate in a popular go|vernment,
or in ab&s;olute monarchy? Here I would
declare frankly, that tho' liberty be infinitely prefer|able
to &s;lavery, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e; yet I &s;hould
much rather wi&s;h to &s;ee an ab&s;olute monarch than a
republic in this i&s;land. For, let us con&s;ider, what
kind of republic we have rea&s;on to expect. The
<PB N="90" REF="90">
que&s;tion is not concerning any fine imaginary repub|lic,
of which a man may form a plan in his clo&s;e$.
There is no doubt, but a popular government may
be imagined more perfect than ab&s;olute monarchy, or
even than our pre&s;ent con&s;titution. But what rea&s;on
have we to expect that any &s;uch government will
ever be e&s;tabli&s;hed in BRITAIN, upon the di&s;&s;olution
of our monarchy? If any &s;ingle per&s;on acquire
power enought to take our con&s;titution to pieces, and
put it up a-new, he is really an ab&s;olute monarch;
and we have had already an in&s;tance of this kind,
&s;ufficient to convince us, that &s;uch a per&s;on will never
re&s;ign his power, or e&s;tabli&s;h any free government.
Matters, therefore, mu&s;t be tru&s;ted to their natural
progre&s;s and operation; and the hou&s;e of commons,
according to its pre&s;ent con&s;titution, mu&s;t be the only
legi&s;lature in &s;uch a popular government. The in|conveniencies,
attending &s;uch a &s;ituation of affairs,
pre&s;ent them&s;elves by thou&s;ands. If the hou&s;e of
commons, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, ever di&s;&s;olves it&s;elf, which
is not to be expected, we may look for a civil war
every election. If it continues it&s;elf, we &s;hall &s;uffer
all the tyranny of a faction, &s;ubdivided into new fac|tions.
And as &s;uch a violent government cannot long
&s;ub&s;i&s;t, we &s;hall, at la&s;t, after infinite convul&s;ions, and
civil wars, find repo&s;e in ab&s;olute monarchy, which
it would have been happier for us to have e&s;tabli&s;hed
peaceably from the beginning. Ab&s;olute monarchy,
<PB N="91" REF="91">
therefore, is the ea&s;ie&s;t death, the true <HI>Euthana&s;ia</HI> of
the BRITISH con&s;titution.</P>
<P>THUS, if we have rea&s;on to be more jealous of
monarchy, becau&s;e the danger is more imminent from
that quarter; we have al&s;o rea&s;on to be more jealous
of popular government, becau&s;e that danger is more
terrible. This may teach us a le&s;&s;on of moderation
in all our political controver&s;ies.</P>

to &s;ecure the peace, happine&s;s, and liberty of future
generations. The influence of u&s;eful inventions in
the arts and &s;ciences may, perhaps, extend farther
than tho&s;e of wi&s;e laws, who&s;e effects are limited both
in time and place; but the benefit ari&s;ing from the
former is not &s;o &s;en&s;ible as that which proceeds from
the latter. Speculative &s;ciences do, indeed, improve
the mind; but this advantage reaches only to a few
per&s;ons, who have lei&s;ure to apply them&s;elves to
them. And as to practical arts, which increa&s;e the
commodities and enjoyments of life, 'tis well known,
that mens happine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in an abun|dance
of the&s;e, as in the peace and &s;ecurity with which
they po&s;&s;e&s;s them; and tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings can only be de|rived

<PB N="94" REF="93">
general virtue and good morals in a &s;tate, which are
so requi&s;ite to happine&s;s, can never ari&s;e from the most
refined precepts of philo&s;ophy, or even the sever&s;t
injunctions of religion; but mu&s;t proceed entirely
from the virtuous education of the youth, the effect
of wi$e laws and in&s;titutions. In mu&s;t, therefore, pre|&s;ume

and mu&s;t regard antiquity as &s;omewhat unju&s;t in its
di&s;tribution of hono&s;r, when it made gods of all the
inventors of u&s;eful arts, &s;uch as CERES, BACCHUS,
AESCULAPIUS; and dignified legi&s;lators, &s;uch as RO|MULUS
and THESUS, only with the appellation of
demi-gods, and heroes.</P>
<P>As much as legi&s;lators and founders of &s;tates ought
to be hounoured and respected among men, as much
ought the founders of &s;ects and factions to be dete&s;ted
and hated; becau&s;e the influence of factions is di|rectly
contrary to that of laws. Factions &s;ubvert go|vernment,
reader laws impotent, and beget the fierceft
animo$ities among men of the &s;ame nation, who ought
to give mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and protection to each other.
And what &s;hould render the founder of parties more
odious is, the difficulty of extirpating the&s;e parties,
when once they have taken ri&s;e in any &s;tate. They
naturally propagate them&s;elves for many centuries, and
&s;eldom end but by the total di&s;&s;olution of that go|vernment,
in which they are planted. They are,
be&s;ides, &s;eeds which grow mo&s;t plentifully in the rich|e&s;t
<PB N="95" REF="94">
$oils; and tho' de&s;potic governments be not en|tirely
free from them, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that they
ri&s;e more ea&s;ily, and propagate them&s;elves fa&s;ter in
free governments, where they always infect the legi|&s;lature
it&s;elf, which alone could be able by the &s;teady
application of rewards and puni&s;hments, to eradicate
them.</P>
<P>FACTIONS or parties may be divided into PER|SONAL
and REAL; that is, into factions founded on
per&s;onal friend&s;hip or animo&s;ity among tho&s;e who
compo&s;e the factions, and into tho&s;e founded on &s;ome
real difference of &s;entiment or intere&s;t. The rea&s;on
of this di&s;tinction is obvious, tho' I mu&s;t acknow|ledge,
that parties are &s;eldom found pure and unmixt,
either of the one kind or the other. Tis not often
&s;een, that a government divides into factions, where
there is no difference in the views of the&s;e factions, either
real or apparent, trivial or material: And in tho&s;e
factions, which are founded on the mo&s;t real and mo&s;t
material difference, there is always ob&s;erved to be a
great deal of per&s;onal animo&s;ity or affection. But
notwith&s;tanding this mixture, a party may be denomi|nated
either per&s;onal or real, according to that prin|ciple
which is peredominant, and is found to have the
greate&s;t influence.</P>
<P>PERSONAL factions ari&s;e mo&s;t ea&s;ily in &s;mall re|publics.
Every dome&s;tic quarrel becomes an affair of
&s;tate. Love, vanity, emulation, any pa&s;&s;ion begets

public divi&s;ion as well as ambition and re&s;entment.
The NERI and BIANCHI of FLORENCE, the FRE|GOSI
and ADOEMI of GENOA, the COLONESSI and
ORSINI of modern ROME, were parties of this kind.</P>
<P>MEN have &s;uch a propen&s;ity to divide into per&s;onal
factions, that the &s;malle&s;t appearance of real difference
will produce them. What can be imagined more
trivial than the difference between one colour of livery
and another in hor&s;e-races? Yet this difference be|got
two mo&s;t inveterate factions in the GREEK em|pire,
the PRASINI and VENETI, who never &s;u&s;pended
their animo&s;ities, till they ruined that unhappy go|vernment.</P>

remarkable, that it could continue for &s;o long a tract
of time; even tho' it did not &s;pread it&s;elf, nor draw
any of the other tribes into a &s;hare of the quarrel If
mankind had not a &s;trong propen&s;ity to &s;uch divi&s;ons,
the indifference of the re&s;t of the community mu&s;t
have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed this fooli&s;h animo&s;ity, that had not
any aliment of new benefits and injuries, of &s;ym|pathy

when the whole &s;tate is rent into two equal factions.</P>
<P>NOTHING is more u&s;ual than to &s;ee parties, which
have begun upon real difference, continue even
after that difference is lo&s;t. When men are once in|li&s;ted
on oppo&s;ite &s;ides, they contract an affection to
the per&s;ons with whom they are united, and an ani|mo&s;ity
again&s;t their antagoni&s;ts: And the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions
they often tran&s;mit to their po&s;terity. The real dif|ference
between GUELF and GHIBBELLINE was long
lo&s;t in ITALY, before the&s;e factions were extinguished.
The GUELFS adhered to the pope, the GHIBBEL|LINES
to the emperor; and yet the family of SFOR|SA,

<P>THE civil wars which aro&s;e &s;ome few years ago
in MOROCCO, betwixt the <HI>bla$ks</HI> and <HI>whites,</HI> merely
on account of their complexion, are founded on a
very plea&s;ant difference. We laugh at them; but I
believe, were things rightly examined, we afford
much more occa&s;ion of ridicule to the MOORS. For,
what are all the wars of religion which have pre|vailed
in this polite and knowing part of the world?
They are certainly more ab&s;urd than the MOORISH
civil wars. The difference of complexion is &s;en&s;ible
and a real difference: But the difference about an ar|ticle
of faith, which is utterly ab&s;urd and unitel|ligible,
is not a difference of &s;entiments, but only a
difference of a few phra&s;es and expre&s;&s;ions, which one
party accepts of, without under&s;tanding them; and
the other refu&s;es, in the &s;ame manner. Be&s;ides, I do
not find, that the <HI>whites</HI> in MOROCCO ever impo&s;ed
on the <HI>blacks</HI> any nece&s;&s;ity of altering their com|plexion,
or threatened them with inqui&s;itions and
penal laws in ca&s;e of ob&s;tinacy; Nor have the <HI>blacks</HI>
been more unrea&s;onable in this particular. But is a
<PB N="99" REF="98">
man's opinion, where he is able to form a real opi|nion,
more at his di&s;po&s;al than his complexion? And
can one be induced by force or fear to do more than
paint and di&s;gui&s;e in the one ca&s;e as well as in the
other?</P>
<P>REAL factions may be divided into factions from
<HI>intere&s;t,</HI> from <HI>principle</HI> and from <HI>affection.</HI> Of all fac|tions,
tho&s;e from intere&s;t are the mo&s;t rea&s;onable, and
mo&s;t excu&s;able. Where two orders of men, &s;uch
as the nobles and people, have a di&s;tinct authority in
a government, which is not very accurately balanced
and modelled, they naturally follow a di&s;tinct intere&s;t:
nor can we rea&s;onably expect a different conduct from
that degree of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which is implanted in hu|man
nature. It requires very great &s;kill in a legi&s;la|tor
to prevent &s;uch factions; and many philo&s;ophers
are of opinion, that this &s;ecret, like the <HI>grand elixir,</HI>
or <HI>perpetual motion,</HI> may amu&s;e men in theory, but can
never po&s;&s;ibly be reduced to practice. In de&s;potic go|vernments,
indeed, factions often do not appear; but
they are never the le&s;s real; or rather, they are more
real and more pernicious, upon that very account.
The di&s;tinct orders of men, nobles and people, &s;ol|diers
and merchants, have all a di&s;tinct intere&s;t; but
the more powerful oppre&s;&s;es the weaker with impu|nity,
and without re&s;i&s;tance; which begets a &s;eeming
tranquillity in &s;uch governments.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="99">
THERE has been an attemt to divide the <HI>landed</HI>
and <HI>trading</HI> intere&s;t in <HI>England;</HI> but without &s;ucce&s;s.
The intere&s;t of the&s;e two bodies is not really di&s;tinct,
and never will be &s;o, till our public debts increa&s;e to
&s;uch a degree, as to become altogether oppre&s;&s;ive and
intolerable.</P>
<P>PARTIES from <HI>principles,</HI> e&s;pecially ab&s;tarct &s;pecu|lative
principles, are known only to modern times,
and are, perhaps, the mo&s;t extraordinary and unac|countable,
<HI>phaenomenon,</HI> which has ever yet appeared
in human affairs. Where different principles beget a
contrariety of conduct, which is the ca&s;e with all dif|ferent
political principles, the matter may be more
ea&s;ily explained. A man, who e&s;teems the true right
of government to lie in one man, or one family,
cannot ea&s;ily agree with his fellow citizen, who thinks
that another man or family is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this right.
Each naturally wi&s;hes that right may take place, ac|cording
to his own notions of it. But where the dif|ference
of principles is attended with no contrariety
of action, but each may follow his own way, without
interfering with his neighbour, as happens in all re|ligious
controver&s;ies; what madne&s;s, what fury can
beget &s;uch unhappy and &s;uch fatal divi&s;ions?</P>
<P>Two men, travelling on the highway, the one
ea&s;t&punc; the other we&s;t, can ea&s;ily pa&s;s each other, if the
way be broad enough: But two men, rea&s;oning upon
<PB N="101" REF="100">
oppo&s;ite principles of religion, cannot &s;o ea&s;ily pa&s;s,
without &s;hocking; tho' one &s;hould think, that the
way were al&s;o, in that ca&s;e, &s;ufficiently broad, and that
each might proceed, without interruption, in his
own cour&s;e. But &s;uch is the nature of the human
mind, that it always takes hold of every mind that
approaches it; and as it is wonderfully fortified and
corroborated by an unanimity of &s;entiments, &s;o is it
&s;hocked and di&s;turbed by any contrariety. Hence the
eagerne&s;s, which mo&s;t people di&s;cover in a di&s;pute;
and hence their impatience of oppo&s;ition, even in the
mo&s;t &s;peculative and indifferent opinions.</P>
<P>THIS principle, however frivolous it may appear,
&s;eems to have been the origin of all religions wars
and divi&s;ions. But, as this principle is univer&s;al in
human nature, its effects would not have been been con|fined
to one$age, and to one &s;ect of religion, did it
not there concur with other more accidental cau&s;es,
which rai&s;e it to &s;uch a height, as to produce the
highe&s;t mi&s;ery and deva&s;tation. Mo&s;t religions of the
ancient world aro&s;e in the unknown ages of governm|ment,
when men were as yet barbarous and unin|&s;tructed,
and the prince, as well as pea&s;ant, was di&s;|po&s;ed
to receive, with implicit faith, every pious tale
or fiction which was offered him. The magi&s;trate
embraced the religion of the people, and entering cor|dially
into the care of &s;acred matters, naturally ac|quired
an authority in them, and united the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical
<PB N="102" REF="101">
with the civil power. But the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> reli|gion
ari&s;ing, while principles directly oppo&s;ite to it
were firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the polite part of the world,
who de&s;pi&s;ed the nation that fir&s;t broached this no|velty;
no wonder, that in &s;uch circum&s;tances, it was
but little countenanced by the civil magi&s;trate, and
that the prie&s;thood were allowed to engro&s;s all the
authority in the new &s;ect. So bad a u&s;e did they
make of this power, even in tho&s;e early times, that
that the per&s;ecutions of Chri&s;tianity may, perhaps
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I &s;ay, <HI>in part;</HI> For 'tis a vulgar error to imagine, that the ancients were as great friends to toleration as the ENGLISH OF DUTCH are at pre&s;ent. The laws again&s;t external &s;uper&s;tition, among&s;t the ROMANS, were as ancient as the time of the twelve tables; and the JEWS as well as CHRISTIANS were &s;ometimes puni&s;hed by them: tho', in general, the&s;e laws were not rigorou&s;ly executed. Immediately after the conque&s;t of GAUL, they forbad all but the natives to be initiated into the religion of the DRUIDS; and this was a kind of per&s;ecution. In about a century after this conque&s;t, the emperor, CLAUDIUS, quite aboli&s;hed that &s;uper&s;tition by penal laws; which would have been a very grievous per&s;ecution, if the imitation of the ROMAN manners had not, before-hand, weaned the GAULS from their ancient prejudices. SUETONIUS <HI>in vita</HI> CLAUDII. PLINY a&s;cribes the abolition of the Druid &s;uper&s;titions to TI|BERIUS, probably becau&s;e that emperor had taken &s;ome &s;teps towards re&s;training them, (lib. 30. cap. 1.) This is an in|&s;tance of the u&s;ual caution and moderation of the ROMANS in &s;uch ca&s;es; and very different from their violent and &s;anguinary method of treating the <HI>Chri&s;tians.</HI> Hence we may entertain a &s;u&s;picion, that tho&s;e furious per&s;ecutions of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, owing to the imprudent zeal and bigotry of the fir&s;t propagators of that &s;ect; and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory af|fords us many rea&s;ons to confirm this &s;u&s;picion.</NOTE> <HI>in part,</HI> be a&s;cribed to the violence in&s;tilled by them
<PB N="103" REF="102">
into their followers. And the &s;ame principles of
prie&s;tly government continuing, after Chri&s;tianity be|came
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, they have engendered a
&s;pirit of per&s;ecution, which has ever &s;ince been the
poi&s;on of human &s;ociety, and the &s;ource of the mo&s;t
inveterate factions in every government. Such fac|tions,
therefore, on the part of the people, may ju&s;tly
be e&s;teemed factions of <HI>principle:</HI> but, on the part of
the prie&s;ts, who are the prime movers, they are really
factions of <HI>intere&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another cau&s;e (be&s;ide the authority of
the prie&s;ts, and the &s;eparation of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and
civil powers) which has contributed to render CHRIS|TENDOM
the &s;cene of religious wars and divi&s;ions.
Religions, that ari&s;e in ages totally ignorant and bar|barous,
con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of traditional tales and fictions,
which may be very different in every &s;ect, without be|ing
contrary to each other; and even when they are
contrary, every one adheres to the tradition of his
own &s;ect, without much rea&s;oning or di&s;putation.
<PB N="104" REF="103">
But as philo&s;ophy was widely &s;pread over the world,
at the time when Chri&s;tianity aro&s;e, the teachers of
the new &s;ect were obliged to form a &s;y&s;tem of &s;pecu|lative
opinions; to divide, with &s;ome accuracy, their
articles of faith; and to explain, comment, confute,
and confirm with all the &s;ubtilty of argument and &s;ci|ence.
From hence naturally aro&s;e keenne&s;s in di&s;|pute,
when the chri&s;tian religion came to be &s;plit in|to
new divi&s;ions and here&s;ies: And this keenne&s;s a&s;|&s;i&s;ted
the prie&s;ts in their pernicious policy, of beget|ting
a mutual hatred and antipathy among their de|luded
followers. Sects of philo&s;ophy, in the ancient
world, were more zealous than parties of religion;
but in modern times, parties of religion are more fu|rious
and enraged than the mo&s;t cruel factions which
ever aro&s;e from intere&s;t and ambition.</P>
<P>I HAVE mentioned parties from <HI>offection</HI> as a kind
of <HI>real</HI> parties, be&s;ide tho&s;e from <HI>interest</HI> and <HI>principle.</HI>
By parties from affection. I under&s;tand tho&s;e which
are founded on the different affections of men to|wards
particular families and per&s;ons, whom they de|$ire
to rule over them. The&s;e parties are often very
violent; tho', I mu&s;t own, it is &s;omewhat unaccount|able,
that men &s;hould attach them&s;elves &s;o &s;trongly
to per&s;ons, with whom they are no way acquainted,
whom perhaps they never &s;aw, and from whom they
never received, nor can ever hope for any favour.
Yet this we find often to be the ca&s;e, and even with
<PB N="105" REF="104">
men, who, on other occa&s;ions, di&s;cover no great ge|nero&s;ity
of &s;pirit, nor are found to be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported
by friend&s;hip beyond their own interest. We are apt,
I know not how, to think the relation betwixt us and
our &s;overeign very clo&s;e and intimate. The &s;plendor
of maje&s;ty and power be&s;tows an importance on the
fortunes even of a &s;ingle per&s;on. And when a man's
good-nature gives him not this imaginary intere&s;t, his
ill-nature will, from &s;pite and oppo&s;ition to per&s;ons
who&s;e &s;entiments are different from his own.

<P>WERE the BRITISH government propo&s;ed as
a &s;ubject of &s;peculation to a &s;tudious man, he
would immediately perceive in it a &s;ource of divi|&s;ion
and party, which it would be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
for it, under any admini&s;tration, to avoid. The ju&s;t
balance between the republican and monarchical part
of our con&s;titution is really, in it&s;elf; &s;o extreme|ly
delicate and uncertain, that when joined to mens
pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible but different
opinions mu&s;t ari&s;e concerning it, even among per|&s;ons
of the be&s;t under&s;tanding. Tho&s;e of mild tem|pers,
who love peace and order, and dete&s;t &s;edition
and civil wars, will always entertain more favour|able
&s;entiments of monarchy, than men of bold and
generous &s;pirits, who are pa&s;&s;ionate lovers of liber|ty,
and think no evil comparable to &s;ubjection and
&s;lavery. And tho' all rea&s;onable men agree in ge|neral
to pre&s;erve our mixed government; yet when
they come to particulars, &s;ome will incline to tru&s;t
<PB N="108" REF="108">
larger powers to the crown, to be&s;tow on it more
influence, and to guard again&s;t its encroachments with
le&s;s caution, than others who are terrified at the mo&s;t
di&s;tant approaches of tyranny and de&s;potic power.
Thus are there parties of PRINCIPLE involved in
the very nature of our con&s;titution, which may pro|perly
enough be denominated tho&s;e of<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e words have become of general u&s;e, and therefore I &s;hall employ them, without intending to expre&s;s by them an univer&s;al blame of the one party, or approbation of the other. The court-party may, no doubt, on &s;ome occa&s;ions con&s;ult be&s;t the intere&s;t of the country, and the country-party oppo&s;e it. In like manner, the ROMAN part$$s were denominated <HI>Op|timates</HI> and <HI>Populares;</HI> and CICERO, like a true party-man, defines the <HI>Optimates</HI> to be &s;uch as, in all their public con|duct, regulated them&s;elves by the &s;entiments of the be&s;t and worthie&s;t of the ROMANS: <HI>Pro.

COUNTRY. The &s;trength and violence of each of
the&s;e part$e$ will much depend upon the particular
admini&s;tration. An administration may be &s;o bad, as
to throw a g$eat majority into the oppo&s;ition; as a
good admini&s;tration will reconcile to the court many
of the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate lovers of liberty. But, how|ever
the nation may fluctuate betwixt them, the par|ties
<PB N="109" REF="109">
them&s;elves will always &s;ub&s;i&s;t, &s;o long as we
are governed by a limited monarchy.</P>
<P>BUT, be&s;ides this difference of <HI>Principle,</HI> tho&s;e par|ties
are very much fomented by a difference of IN|TEREST,
without which they could &s;carce ever be
dangerous or violent. The crown will naturally be|&s;tow
all its tru&s;t and power upon tho&s;e, who&s;e prin|ciples,
real or pretended, are mo&s;t favourable to mo|narchical
government; and this temptation will na|turally
engage them to go greater lengths than their
principles would otherwi&s;e carry them. Their an|tagoni&s;ts,
who are di&s;appointed in their ambitious
aims, throw them&s;elves into the party who&s;e princi|ples
incline them to be mo&s;t jealous of royal power,
and naturally carry tho&s;e principles to a greater length
than &s;ound politics will ju&s;tify. Thus, the <HI>Court</HI> and
<HI>Country</HI> parties, which are the genuine offspring of
the BRITISH government, are a kind of mixt parties,
and are influenced both by principle and by intere&s;t.
The heads of the factions are commonly mo&s;t govern|ed
by the latter motive; the inferior members of
them by the former. I mu&s;t be under&s;tood to mean
this of per&s;ons who have motives for taking party
on any &s;ide. For, to tell the truth, the greate&s;t part
are commonly men who a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves they

deemed, from long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to belong to
them as their birth-right. An ambitious, or rather
an ignorant, prince aro&s;e, who e&s;teemed all the&s;e pri|vileges
to be conce&s;&s;ions of his predece&s;&s;ors, revo|cable
at plea&s;ure; and, in pro&s;ecution of this prin|ciple,
he openly acted in violation of liberty, during
the cour&s;e of &s;everal years. Nece&s;&s;ity, at la&s;t, con|&s;trained
him to call a parliament: the &s;pirit of li|berty
aro&s;e and &s;pread it&s;elf: The prince, being
without any &s;upport, was obliged to grant every thing
required of him: And his enemies, jealous and im|placable,
&s;et no bounds to their preten&s;ions. Here
then began tho&s;e conte&s;ts, in which it was no won|der,
that men of that age were divided into diffe|rent
parties; &s;ince even at this day, the impartial
are at a lo&s;s to decide concerning the ju&s;tice of the
quarrel. The preten&s;ions of the parliament, if yield|ed
to, broke the balance of our con&s;titution, by ren|dering
the government almo&s;t intirely republican.
If not yielded to, we were, perhaps, &s;till in danger
<PB N="113" REF="113">
of de&s;potic power, from the &s;ettled principles and
inveterate habits of the king, which had plainly ap|peared
in every conce&s;&s;ion that he had been con|&s;trained
to make to his people. In this que&s;tion, &s;o
delicate and uncertain, men naturally &s;ell to the &s;ide
which was mo&s;t conformable to their u&s;ual princi|ples;
and tho&s;e, who were the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate fa|vourers
of monarchy, declared for the king, as the
zealous friends of liberty &s;ided with the parliament.
The hopes of &s;ucce&s;s being nearly equal on both
fides, <HI>intere&s;t</HI> had no general influence in this con|te&s;t:
So that ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER were
merely parties of principle; neither of which di&s;|owned
either monarchy or liberty; but the former
party inclined mo&s;t to the republican part of our
government, and the latter to the monarchical. In
this re&s;pect they may be con&s;idered as court and
country-party enflamed into a civil war, by an un|happy
concurrence of circum&s;tances, and by the tur|bulent
&s;pirit of the age. The commonwealth's men,
and the partizans of de&s;potic power, lay concealed in
both parties, and formed but an incon&s;iderable part
of them.</P>
<P>THE clergy had concurred with the king's arbi|trary
de&s;igns, according to their u&s;ual maxims in &s;uch
ca&s;es: And, in return, were allowed to per&s;ecute
their adver&s;aries, whom they called heretics and &s;chi&s;|matics.
The e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy were epi&s;copal; the
<PB N="114" REF="114">
non-conformi&s;ts pre$byterian: So that all things con|curred
to throw the former, without re&s;erve, into the
king's party; and the latter into that of the par|liament.
The <HI>Cavaliers</HI> being the court party, and
the <HI>Round-heads</HI> the country-party, the union was in|fallible
between the former and the e&s;tabli&s;hed pre|lacy,
and between the latter and pre&s;byterian non-conformi&s;ts.
This union is &s;o natural, according to
the general principles of politics, that it requires
&s;ome very extraordinary &s;ituation of affairs to break
it.</P>
<P>EVERY one knows the event of this quarrel; fa|tal
to the king fir&s;t, and to the parliament afterwards.
After many confu&s;ions and revolutions, the royal fa|mily
was at la&s;t re&s;tored, and the government e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
on the &s;ame footing as before. CHARLES II.
was not made wi&s;er by the example of his father;
but pro&s;ecuted the &s;ame mea&s;ures, tho' at fir&s;t, with
more &s;ecrecy and caution. New parties aro&s;e, under
the appellations of <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Tory,</HI> which have con|tinued
ever &s;ince to confound and di&s;tract our go|vernment.
What the nature is of the&s;e parties, is,
perhaps, one of the mo&s;t difficult que&s;tions, which
can be met with, and is a proof that hi&s;tory may con|tain
problems, as uncertain as any, which are to be
found in the mo&s;t ab&s;tract &s;ciences. We have &s;een
the conduct of the&s;e two parties, during the cour&s;e
of &s;eventy years, in a va&s;t variety of circum&s;tances,
<PB N="115" REF="115">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power, and deprived of it, during peace
and during war: Per&s;ons, who profe&s;s them&s;elves of
one &s;ide or other, we meet every hour, in company,
in our plea&s;ures, in our &s;erious occupations: We our|&s;elves
are con&s;trained, in a manner, to take party;
and living in a country of the highe&s;t liberty, every
one may openly declare all his &s;entiments and opi|nions:
And yet we are at a lo&s;s to tell the nature,
preten&s;ions, and principles of the parties. The que|&s;tion
is, perhaps, in it&s;elf, &s;omewhat di&s;&s;icult; but
has been rendered more &s;o, by the prejudice and vio|lence
of party.</P>
<P>When we compare the parties of WHIG and
TORY, to tho&s;e of ROUND-HEAD and CAVALIER,
the mo&s;t obvious difference, which appears betwixt
them, con&s;i&s;ts in the principles of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience,</HI>
and <HI>indefea&s;ible right,</HI> which were but little heard of
among the CAVALIERS, but became the univer&s;al
doctrine, and were e&s;teemed the true characteri&s;tic of
a TORY. Were the&s;e principles pu&s;hed into their
mo&s;t obvious con&s;equences, they imply a formal re|nunciation
of all our liberties, and an avowal of ab|&s;olute
monarchy; &s;ince nothing can be a greater ab|&s;urdity
than a limited power, which mu&s;t not be re|&s;i&s;ted,
even when it exceeds its limitations. But as
the mo&s;t rational principles are often but a weak
counterpoi&s;e to pa&s;&s;ion; 'tis no wonder, that the&s;e
ab&s;urd principles, <HI>&s;ufficient,</HI> according to a celebrat|ed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Differtation on parties, <HI>Letter</HI> 2d.</NOTE>
<PB N="116" REF="116">
author, <HI>to &s;hock the common &s;en&s;e of a</HI> HOTTEN|TOT
or SAMOIEDE, were found too weak for that
effect. The TORIES, as men, were enemies to op|pre&s;&s;ion;
and al&s;o as ENGLISHMEN, they were ene|mies
to de&s;potic power. Their zeal for liberty, was,
perhaps, le&s;s &s;ervent than that of their antagoni&s;ts; but
was &s;ufficient to make them forget all their general prin|ciples,
when they &s;aw them&s;elves openly threatened
with a &s;ubver&s;ion of the antient government. From
the&s;e &s;entiments aro&s;e the <HI>revolution;</HI> an event of
mighty con&s;equence, and the firme&s;t foundation of
BRITISH liberty. The conduct of the TORIES, dur|ing
that event, and after it, will afford us a true in&s;ight
into the nature of that party.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, They appear to have had the
&s;entiments of true BRITONS in their affections to
liberty, and in their determined re&s;olution not to
&s;acrifice it to any ab&s;tract principles what&s;over, or to
any imaginary rights of princes. This part of their
character might ju&s;tly have been doubted of before
the <HI>revolution,</HI> from the obvious tendency of their
avowed principles, and from their great compliances
with a court, which made little &s;ecret of its arbitrary
de&s;igns. The <HI>revlution</HI> &s;hewed them to have been,
in this re&s;pect, nothing but a genuine <HI>court-party,</HI> &s;uch
as might be expected in a BRITISH government:
That is, <HI>Lovers of liberty, but greater lovers of mo|narchy.</HI>
<PB N="117" REF="117">
It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that they
carried their monarchical principles further, even in
practice, but more &s;o in theory, than was, in any de|gree,
con&s;i&s;tent with a limited government.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> NEITHER their principles nor affections
concurred, entirely or heartily, with the &s;ettlement
made at the <HI>revolution,</HI> or with that which has &s;ince
taken place. This part of their character may &s;eem
contradictory to the former; &s;ince any other &s;ettle|ment,
in tho&s;e circum&s;tances of the nation, mu&s;t pro|bably
have been dangerous, if not fatal to liberty.
But the heart of man is made to reconcile contradic|tions
; and this contradiction is not greater than that
betwixt <HI>pa&s;&s;ive obedience,</HI> and the <HI>re&s;i&s;tance</HI> employed
at the <HI>revolution.</HI> A TORY, therefore, &s;ince the <HI>revo|lution
,</HI> may be defined in a few words, to be <HI>a lover
of monarchy, tho' without abandoning liberty; and a
partizan of the family of</HI> STUART. As a WHIG may
be defined to be <HI>a lover of liberty, tho' without re|nouncing
monarchy; and a friend to the &s;ettlement in
the</HI> PROTESTANT <HI>line</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The author above cited has a&s;&s;erted, that the REAL di&s;|tinction betwixt WHIG and TORY was lo&s;t at the <HI>revolution,</HI> and that ever &s;ince they have continued to be mere <HI>per&s;onal</HI> par|ties, like the GUELFS and GIBBELINES, after the emperors had lo&s;t all authority in ITALY. Such an opinion, were it received, would turn our whole hi&s;tory into an aenigma.</P>
<P>I &s;hall fir&s;t mention, as a proof of a real di&s;tinction betwixt the&s;e parties, what every one may have ob&s;erved or heard con|cerning the conduct and conver&s;ation of all his friends and ac|quaintance on both &s;ides. Have not the TORIES always bore an avowed affection to the family of STUART, and have not their adver&s;aries always oppo&s;ed with vigour the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of that family?</P>
<P>The TORY principles are confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t favourable to monarchy. Yet the tories have almo&s;t always oppo&s;ed the court the&s;e fifty years; nor were they cordial friends to King WIL|LIAM, even when employed by him. Their&punc; quarrel, there|fore, cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain with the throne, but with the per&s;on who &s;at on it.</P>
<P>They concurred heartily with the court during the four la&s;t years of Queen ANNE. But is any one at a lo&s;s to find the rea&s;on?</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown in the BRITISH government is a point of too great con&s;equence to be ab&s;olutely indifferent to per&s;ons who concern them&s;elves, in any degree, about the for|tune of the public; much le&s;s can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the TO|RY party, who never valued them&s;elves upon moderation, could maintain a <HI>&s;toical</HI> indifference in a point of &s;uch importance. Were they, therefore, zealous for the hou&s;e of HANOVER? Or was there any thing that kept an oppo&s;ite zeal from openly ap|pearing, if it did not openly appear, but prudence, and a &s;en&s;e of decency?</P>
<P>'Tis mon&s;trous to &s;ee an e&s;tabli&s;hed epi&s;copal clergy in declared oppo&s;ition to the court, and a non-conformi&s;t pre&s;byterian clergy in conjunction with it. What could have produced &s;uch an unnatural conduct in both? Nothing, but that the former e&s;pou&s;ed monarchical principles too high for the pre&s;ent &s;ettle|ment, which is founded on principles of liberty: And the lat|ter, being afraid of the prevalence of tho&s;e high principles, ad|hered to that party, from whom they had rea&s;on to expect liber|ty and toleration.</P>
<P>The different conduct of the two parties, with regard to fo|reign politics, is al&s;o a proof to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. HOLLAND has always been mo&s;t favoured by one, and FRANCE by the other. In &s;hort, the proofs of this kind &s;eem &s;o palpable and evident, that 'tis almo&s;t needle&s;s to collect them.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="118">
THESE different views, with regard to the &s;ettle|ment
of the crown, were accidental, but natural ad|ditions
<PB N="119" REF="119">
to the principles of the <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> par|ties,
which are the genuine parties of the BRITISH
government. A pa&s;&s;ionate lover of monarchy is apt
to be di&s;plea&s;ed at any change of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; as
&s;avouring too much of a commonwealth: A pa&s;&s;ion|ate
lover of liberty, is apt to think that every part of
the government ought to be &s;ubordinate to the inter|e
&s;ts of liberty. 'Tis however remarkable, that tho'
the principles of WHIG and TORY were both of them
of a compound nature; yet the ingredients, which
predominated in both, were not corre&s;pondent to each
other. A TORY loved monarchy, and bore an af|fection
to the family of STUART; but the latter af|fection
was the predominant inclination of the party.
A WHIG-loved-liberty, and was a friend to the &s;et|tlement
<PB N="120" REF="120">
in the PROTESTANT line; but the love of
liberty was profe&s;&s;edly his predominant inclination.
The TORIES have frequently acted as republicans,
where either policy or revenge has engaged them to
that conduct; and there was no one of that party,
who, upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that he was to be di&s;ap|pointed
in his views with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
would not have de&s;ired to impo&s;e the &s;tricte&s;t limita|tions
on the crown, and to bring our form of govern|ment
as near republican as po&s;&s;ible, in order to de|pre&s;s
the family, which, according to his apprehen|&s;ion,
&s;ucceeded without any ju&s;t title. The WHIGS,
'tis true, have al&s;o taken &s;teps dangerous to liberty,
under colour of &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion and &s;ettlement
of the crown, according to their views: But as the
body of the party had no pa&s;&s;ion for that &s;ucce&s;&s;ion,
otherwi&s;e than as the means of &s;ecuring liberty, they
have been betrayed into the&s;e &s;teps by ignorance or
frailty, or the intere&s;ts of their leaders. The &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of the crown was, therefore, the chief point with
the TORIES; the &s;ecurity of our liberties with the
WHIGS. Nor is this &s;eeming irregularity at all dif|ficult
to be accounted for, by our pre&s;ent theory.
<HI>Court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> parties are the true parents of TORY
and WHIG. But 'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, that the at|tachment
of the <HI>court</HI> party to monarchy &s;hould not
degenerate into an attachment to the monarch; there
being &s;o clo&s;e a connexion between them, and the lat|ter
being &s;o much the more natural object. How
<PB N="121" REF="121">
ea&s;ily does the wor&s;hip of the divinity degenerate into
a wor&s;hip of the idol? The connexion is not &s;o great
betwixt liberty, the divinity of the old <HI>country</HI> party
or WHIGS, and any monarch or royal family; nor is
it &s;o rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that in that party, the wor|&s;hip
can be &s;o ea&s;ily transferred from the one to the
other. Tho' even that would be no great miracle.</P>
<P>'TIS difficult to penetrate into the thoughts and
&s;entiments of any particular man; but 'tis almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible
to di&s;tingui&s;h tho&s;e of a whole party, where it
often happens, that no two per&s;ons agree preci&s;ely in
the &s;ame maxims of conduct. Yet I will venture to
affirm, that it was not &s;o much PRINCIPLE, or an
opinion of indefea&s;ible right, which attached the
TORIES to the ancient royal family, as AFFECTION,
or a certain love and e&s;teem for their per&s;ons. The
&s;ame cau&s;e divided ENGLAND formerly between the
hou&s;es of YORK and LANCASTER, and SCOTLAND
between the families of BRUCE and BALIOL; in an
age, when political di&s;putes were but little in fa&s;hion,
and when political <HI>principles</HI> mu&s;t of cour&s;e have had
but little influence on mankind. The doctrine of
pa&s;&s;ive obedience is &s;o ab&s;urd in it&s;elf, and &s;o oppo&s;ite
to our liberties, that it &s;eems to have been chiefly left
to pulpit-declaimers, and to their deluded followers
among the vulgar. Men of better &s;en&s;e were guided
by <HI>affection;</HI> and as to the leaders of this party, 'tis
probable, that <HI>intere&s;t</HI> was their chief motive, and
<PB N="122" REF="122">
that they acted more contrary to their private &s;enti|ments,
than the leaders of the oppo&s;ite party. Tho'
'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to maintain with zeal the right of
any per&s;on or family, without acquiring a good-will
to them, and changing the <HI>principle</HI> into <HI>affection;</HI> yet
this is le&s;s natural to people of an elevated &s;tation and
liberal education, who have had full opportunity of
ob&s;erving the weakne&s;s, folly, and arrogance of mo|narchs,
and have found them to be nothing &s;uperior,
if not rather inferior to the re&s;t of mankind. The
<HI>intere&s;t,</HI> therefore, of being heads of a party does of|ten,
with &s;uch people, &s;upply the place both of <HI>prin|ciple</HI> and <HI>affection.</HI></P>
<P>SOME, who will not venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the <HI>real</HI>
difference betwixt WHIG and TORY was lo&s;t at the
<HI>revolution,</HI> &s;eem inclined to think, that the difference
is now aboli&s;hed, and that affairs are &s;o far returned to
their natural &s;tate, that there are at pre&s;ent no other par|ties
among&s;t us but <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country;</HI> that is, men,
who by intere&s;t or principle, are attached either to mo|narchy
or to liberty. It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;t, that
the TORY party &s;eem, of late, to have decayed much
in their numbers; &s;till more in their zeal; and I may
venture to &s;ay, &s;till more in their credit and authority.
There are few men of knowledge or learning, at lea&s;t,
few philo&s;ophers, &s;ince Mr. LOCKE has wrote, who
would not be a&s;hamed to be thought of that party;
and in almo&s;t all companies the name of OLD WHIG
<PB N="123" REF="123">
is mentioned as an unconte&s;table appellation of honour
and dignity. Accordingly, the enemies of the mi|ni&s;try,
as a reproach, call the courtiers the true TO|RIES
; and as an honour, denominate the gentlemen
in the <HI>oppo&s;ition</HI> the true WHIGS. The TORIES have
been &s;o long obliged to talk in the republican &s;tile,
that they &s;eem to have made converts of them&s;elves
by their hypocri&s;y, and to have embraced the &s;enti|ments,
as well as language of their adver&s;aries. There
are, however, very con&s;iderable remains of that par|ty
in ENGLAND, with all their old prejudices; and a
proof, that <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country</HI> are not our only par|ties,
is, that almo&s;t all the di&s;&s;enters &s;ide with the
court, and the lower clergy, at lea&s;t, of the church of
ENGLAND, with the oppo&s;ition. This may convince
us, that &s;ome bya&s;s &s;till hangs upon our con&s;titution,
&s;ome extrin&s;ic weight, which turns it from its natural
cour&s;e, and cau&s;es a confu&s;ion in our parties.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that
we never had any TORIES in SCOTLAND, according
to the proper &s;ignification of the word, and that the
divi&s;ion of parties in this country was really into
WHIGS and JACOBITES. A JACOBITE &s;eems to be
a TORY, who has no regard to the con&s;titution, but
is either a zealous partizan of ab&s;olute monarchy, or at
lea&s;t willing to &s;acrifice our liberties to the obtaining the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion in that family to which he is attached. The
rea&s;on of the difference betwixt ENGLAND and SCOT|LAND,
<PB N="124" REF="124">
I take to be this: Political and religious di|vi&s;ions
in the latter country, have been, &s;ince the <HI>re|volution
,</HI> regularly corre&s;pondent to each other. The
PRESBYTERIANS were all WHIGS without excep|tion
: Tho&s;e who favoured <HI>epi&s;copacy,</HI> of the oppo&s;ite
party. And as the clergy of the latter &s;ect were
turned out of their churches at the <HI>revolution,</HI> they had
no motive for making any compliances with the go|vernment
in their oaths, or their forms of prayers, but
openly avowed the highe&s;t principles of their party;
which is the cau&s;e, why their followers have been
more viclent than their brethren of the TORY party
in ENGLAND<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some of the opinions, delivered in the&s;e E&s;&s;ays, with re|gard to the public tran&s;actions in the la&s;t century, the author, on more accurate examination, found occa&s;ion to retract in his <HI>Hi&s;tory of</HI> GREAT BRITAIN.

<P>THESE two &s;pecies of fal&s;e religion, tho' both per|nicious,
are yet of a very different, and even of a con|trary
nature. The mind of man is &s;ubject to certain
unaccountable terrors and apprehen&s;ions, proceeding
either from the unhappy &s;ituation of private or public
affairs, from ill health, from a gloomy and melan|choly
di&s;po&s;ition, or from the concurrence of all
the&s;e circum&s;tances. In &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, infinite
unknonw evils are dreaded from unknown agents;
and where real objects of terror are wanting, the &s;oul,
active to its own prejudice, and fo&s;tering its predomi|nant
inclination, finds imaginary ones, to who&s;e
power and malevolence it &s;ets no limits. As the&s;e
enemies are entirely invi&s;ible and unknown, the me|thods
taken to appea&s;e them are equally unaccount|able,
<PB N="126" REF="126">
and con&s;i&s;t in ceremonies, ob&s;ervances, mortifi|cations,
&s;acrifices, pre&s;ents, or in any practice, how|ever
ab&s;urd or frivolous, which either folly or kna|very
recommends to a blind and terrified credulity.
Weakne&s;s, fear, melancholy, together with igno|rance,
are, therefore, the true &s;ources of SUPER|STITION.</P>
<P>BUT the mind of man is al&s;o &s;ubject to an unac|countable
elevation and pre&s;umption, proceeding
from pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s, from luxuriant health, from
&s;trong &s;pirits, or from a bold and confident di&s;po&s;i|tion.
In &s;uch a &s;tate of mind, the imagination &s;wells
with great, but confu&s;ed conceptions, to which no
&s;ublunary beauties or enjoyments can corre&s;pond.
Every thing mortal and peri&s;hable vani&s;hes as un|worthy
of attention. And a full range is given to the
fancy in the invi&s;ible regions or world of &s;pirits,
where the &s;oul is at liberty to indulge it&s;elf in every
imagination, which may be&s;t &s;uit its pre&s;ent ta&s;te and
di&s;po&s;ition. Hence ari&s;e raptures, tran&s;ports, and
&s;urpri&s;ing flights of fancy; and confidence and pre|&s;umption
&s;till increa&s;ing, the&s;e raptures being alto|gether
unaccountable, and &s;eeming quite beyond the
reach of our ordinary faculties, are attributed to the
immediate in&s;piration of that Divine Being, who is
the object of devotion. In a little time, the in&s;pired
per&s;on comes to regard him&s;elf as the chief favourite
of the Divinity; and when this frenzy once takes
<PB N="127" REF="127">
place, which is the &s;ummit of enthu&s;ia&s;m, every
whim&s;y is con&s;ecrated: Human rea&s;on, and even mo|rality
are rejected as fallacious guides: And the fana|tic
madman delivers him&s;elf over, blindly, and with|out
re&s;erve, the &s;uppo&s;ed illap&s;es of the &s;pirit, and
to in&s;pirations from above. Hope, pride, pre&s;ump|tion,
a warm imagination, together with ignorance,
are, therefore, the true &s;ources of ENTHUSIASM.</P>
<P>THESE two &s;pecies of fal&s;e religion might afford
occa&s;ion to many &s;peculations; but I &s;hall confine
my&s;elf, at pre&s;ent, to a few reflexions concerning their
different influence on government and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>MY fir&s;t reflection is, <HI>That &s;uper&s;tion is favour|able
to prei&s;tly power, and enthu&s;ia&s;m as much or ra|ther
more contrary to it, than &s;ound rea&s;on and philo|&s;ophy.</HI>
As &s;uper&s;tition is founded on fear, &s;orrow, and
a depre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits, it repre&s;ents the man to him|&s;elf
in &s;uch de&s;picable colours, that he appears un|worthy
in his own eyes, of approaching the divine
pre&s;ence, and naturally has recour&s;e to any other per|&s;on,
who&s;e &s;anctity of life, or, perhaps, impudence
and cunning, have made him be &s;uppo&s;ed more fa|voured
by the Divinity. To him the &s;uper&s;titious
entru&s;t their devotions: To his care they recommend
their prayers, petitions, and &s;acrifices: And by his
means, hope to render their addre&s;&s;es acceptable to
<PB N="128" REF="128">
their incen&s;ed deity. Hence the origin of PRIESTS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">By <HI>Prie&s;ts</HI> I here mean only the pretenders to power and dominion, and to a &s;uperior &s;anctity of character, di&s;tinct from virtue and good morals. The&s;e are very different from <HI>clergymen,</HI> who are &s;et apart, <HI>by the laws,</HI> to the care of &s;acred matters, and to the conducting our public devotions with greater decency and order. There is no rank of men more to be re&s;pected than the latter.</NOTE>,
who may ju&s;tly be regarded as one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t in|ventions
of a timorous and abject &s;uper&s;tition, which,
ever diffident of it&s;elf, dares not offer up its own de|votions,
but ignorantly thinks to recommend it&s;elf to
the divinity, by the mediation of his &s;uppo&s;ed friends
and &s;ervants. As &s;uper&s;tition is a con&s;iderable ingre|dient
in almo&s;t all religions, even the mo&s;t fanatical;
there being nothing but philo&s;ophy able to conquer
entirely the&s;e unaccountable terrors; hence it pro|ceeds,
that in almo&s;t every &s;ect of religion there are
prie&s;ts to be found. But the &s;tronger mixture there
is of &s;uper&s;tition, the higher is the authority of the
prie&s;thood. Modern judai&s;m and popery, (e&s;pecially
the latter) being the mo&s;t unphilo&s;ophical and ab&s;urd
&s;uper&s;titions which have yet been known in the
world, are the mo&s;t en&s;laved by their prie&s;ts. As the
church of ENGLAND may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to retain &s;ome
mixture of popi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, it partakes al&s;o, in its
original con&s;titution, of a propen&s;ity to prie&s;tly power
<PB N="129" REF="129">
and dominion; particularly in the re&s;pect it exacts to
the &s;acerdotal character. And tho', according to the
&s;entiments of that church, the prayers of the prie&s;t
mu&s;t be accompanied with tho&s;e of the laity; yet is
he the mouth of the congregation, his per&s;on is &s;acred,
and without his pre&s;ence few would think their pub|lic
devotions, or the &s;acraments, and other rites, ac|ceptable
to the divinity.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be ob&s;erved, that all en|thu&s;ia&s;ts
have been free from the yoke of eccle&s;ia&s;tics,
and have expre&s;t great independence in their devo|tion;
with a contempt of forms, ceremonies, and
traditions. The <HI>quakers</HI> are the mo&s;t egregious, tho'
at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t innocent enthu&s;ia&s;ts that
have been yet known; and are, perhaps, the only
&s;ect, who have never admitted prie&s;ts among&s;t them.
The <HI>independents,</HI> of all the ENGLISH &s;ecta$ies, ap|proach
neare&s;t to the <HI>quakers</HI> in fanatici&s;m, and in
their freedom from prie&s;tly bondage. The <HI>pre&s;by|terians</HI>
follow after, at an equal di&s;tance in both the&s;e
particulars. In &s;hort, this ob&s;ervation is founded in
the mo&s;t certain experience; and will al&s;o appear to
be founded on rea&s;on, if we con&s;ider, that as en|thu&s;ia&s;m
ari&s;es from a pre&s;umptuous pride and confi|dence,
it thinks it&s;elf &s;ufficiently qualified to <HI>ap|proach</HI>
the divinity, without any human mediator.
Its rapturous devotions are &s;o fervent, that it even
imagines it&s;elf <HI>actually</HI> to <HI>approach</HI> him by the way of
<PB N="130" REF="130">
contemplation and inward conver&s;e; which makes it
neglect all tho&s;e outward ceremonies and ob&s;ervan|ces,
to which the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the prie&s;ts appears &s;o re|qui&s;ite
in the eyes of their &s;uper&s;titious votaries. The
fanatic con&s;ecrates him&s;elf, and be&s;tows on his own
per&s;on a &s;acred character, much &s;uperior to what
forms and ceremonious in&s;titutions can confer on any
other.</P>
<P>MY <HI>&s;econd</HI> reflection with regard to the&s;e &s;pecies of
fal&s;e religion is, <HI>that religions, which partake of enthu|&s;ia&s;m
are, on their fir&s;t ri&s;e, much more furious and
violent than tho&s;e which partake of &s;uper&s;tition; but in
a little time become much more gentle and moderate.</HI>
The violence of this &s;pecies of religion, when excited
by novelty, and animated by oppo&s;ition, appears
from numberle&s;s in&s;tances; of the <HI>anabapti&s;ts</HI> in GER|MANY,
the <HI>cami&s;ars</HI> in FRANCE, the <HI>levellers</HI> and
other fanatics in ENGLAND, and the <HI>covenanters</HI> in
SCOTLAND. Enthu&s;ia&s;m being founded on &s;trong
&s;pirits, and a pre&s;umptuous boldne&s;s of character, it
naturally begets the mo&s;t extreme re&s;olutions; e&s;pe|cially
after it ri&s;es to that height as to in&s;pire the de|luded
fanatics with the opinion of divine illumina|tions,
and with a contempt for the common rules of
rea&s;on, morality and prudence.</P>
<P>'TIS thus enthu&s;ia&s;m produces the mo&s;t cruel de&s;o|lations
in human &s;ociety: But its fury is like that of
<PB N="131" REF="131">
thunder and tempe&s;t, which exhau&s;t them&s;elves in a
little time, and leave the air more calm and &s;erene
than before. When the fir&s;t fire of enthu&s;ia&s;m is
&s;pent, men naturally, in all fanatical &s;ects, &s;ink into
the greate&s;t remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and coolne&s;s in &s;acred matters;
there being no body of men among&s;t them, endow|ed
with &s;ufficient authority, who&s;e intere&s;t is con|cerned
to &s;upport the religious &s;pirit: No rites, no
ceremonies, no holy ob&s;ervances, which may enter
into the common train of life, and pre&s;erve the &s;a|cred
principles from oblivion. Super&s;tition, on the
contrary, &s;teals in gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly; renders
men tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive; is acceptable to the ma|gi&s;trate,
and &s;eems inoffen&s;ive to the people: Till at
la&s;t the prie&s;t, having firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed his authority,
becomes the tyrant and di&s;turber of human &s;ociety,
by his endle&s;s contentions, per&s;ecutions, and religious
wars. How &s;moothly did the ROMISH church ad|vance
in their acqui&s;ition of power? But into what
di&s;mal convul&s;ions did they throw all EUROPE, in
order to maintain it? On the other hand, our &s;ec|taries,
who were formerly &s;uch dangerous bigots, are
now become very free rea&s;oners; and the <HI>quakers</HI>
&s;eem to approach nearly the only regular body of
<HI>dei&s;ts</HI> in the univer&s;e, the <HI>literati,</HI> or the di&s;ciples of
CONFUCIUS in CHINA<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The CHINESE Literati have no prie&s;ts or eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;ta|bli&s;hment.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="132">
MY <HI>third</HI> ob&s;ervation on this head is, <HI>that &s;uper|&s;tition
is an enemy to civil liberty, and enthu&s;ia&s;m a
friend to it.</HI> As &s;uper&s;tition groans under the domi|nion
of the prie&s;ts, and enthu&s;ia&s;m is de&s;tructive of
all eccle&s;ia&s;tical power, this &s;ufficiently accounts for
the pre&s;ent ob&s;ervation. Not to mention, that en|thu&s;ia&s;m
being the infirmity of bold and ambitious
tempers, is naturally accompanied with a &s;pirit of li|berty;
as &s;uper&s;tition, on the contrary, renders men
tame and abject, and fits them for &s;lavery. We learn
from the ENGLISH hi&s;tory, that, during the civil
wars, the <HI>independents</HI> and <HI>dei&s;ts,</HI> tho' the mo&s;t oppo|&s;ite
in their religious principles; yet were united in
their political ones, and were alike pa&s;&s;ionate for a
commonwealth. And &s;ince the origin of <HI>whig</HI> and
<HI>tory,</HI> the leaders of the <HI>whigs</HI> have either been <HI>dei&s;ts</HI>
or profe&s;t <HI>latitudinarians</HI> in their principles; that is,
friends to toleration, and indifferent to any parti|cular
&s;ect of <HI>chri&s;tians:</HI> While the &s;ectaries, who
have all a &s;trong tincture of enthu&s;ia&s;m, have always,
without exception, concurred with that party, in the
defence of civil liberty. The re&s;emblance in their
&s;uper&s;titions long united the high-church <HI>tories,</HI> and
the <HI>Roman catholics,</HI> in the &s;upport of prerogative and
kingly power; tho' experience of the tolerating &s;pirit
of the <HI>whigs</HI> &s;eems of late to have reconciled the <HI>ca|tholics</HI>
to that party.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="133">
THE <HI>molini&s;ts</HI> and <HI>jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> in FRANCE have a
thou&s;and unintelligible di&s;putes, which are not wor|thy
the reflection of a man of &s;en&s;e: But what princi|pally
di&s;tingui&s;hes the&s;e two &s;ects, and alone merits at|tention,
is the different &s;pirit of their religion. The
<HI>molini&s;t.,</HI> conducted by the <HI>je&s;uites,</HI> are great friends to
&s;uper&s;tition, rigid ob&s;ervers of external forms and ce|remonies,
and devoted to the authority of the prie&s;ts,
and to tradition. The <HI>jar&s;eni&s;ts</HI> are enthu&s;ia&s;ts, and
zealous promoters of the pa&s;&s;ionate devotion, and of
the inward life; little influenced by authority; and,
in a word, but half catholics. The con&s;equences are
exactly conformable to the foregoing rea&s;oning. The
<HI>je&s;uites</HI> are the tyrants of the people, and the &s;laves
of the court: And the <HI>jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> pre&s;erve alive the

<HEAD>ESSAY XIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of AVARICE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that comic writers exag|gerate
every character, and draw their fop,
or coward with &s;tronger features than are any where
to be met with in nature. This moral kind of paint|ing
for the &s;tage has been often compared to the paint|ing
for cupolas and cielings, where the colours are
over-charged, and every part is drawn exce&s;&s;ively
large, and beyond nature. The figures &s;eem mon|&s;trous
and di&s;proportioned, when &s;een too nigh; but
become natural and rengular, when &s;et at a di&s;tance,
and placed in that point of view, in which they
are intended to be &s;urveyed. For a like rea&s;on,
when characters are exhibited in theatrical repre&s;en|tations,
the want of reality removes, in a manner,
the per&s;onages; and redering them more cold and
unentertaining, makes it nece&s;&s;ary to compen&s;ate, by
the force of colouring, what they want in &s;ub&s;tance.
Thus we find in common life, that when a man
once allows him&s;elf to depart from truth in his nar|rations,
he never can keep within bounds of pro|bability;
<PB N="136" REF="135">
but adds &s;till &s;ome new circum&s;tance to ren|der
his &s;tories more marvellous, and to &s;atisfy his
imagination. Two men in buckram &s;uits became
eleven to Sir JOHN FALSTAFF before the end of his
&s;tory.</P>
<P>THERE is only one vice, which may be found
in life with as &s;trong features, and a high a colour|ing
as need be employed by any &s;atyri&s;t or comic
poet; and that is AVARICE. Every day we meet
with men of immen&s;e fortunes, without heirs, and
on the very brink of the grave, who refu&s;e them|&s;elves
the mo&s;t common nece&s;&s;aries of life, and go
on heaping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, under all the
real pre&s;&s;ures of the &s;evere&s;t poverty. An old u&s;urer,
&s;ays the &s;tory, lying in his la&s;t agonies was pre&s;ented
by the prie&s;t with the crucifix to wor&s;hip. He opens
his eyes a moment before he expires, con&s;iders the
crucifix, and cries, <HI>These jewels are not true; I can
only lend ten pi&s;t$les upon &s;uch a pledge.</HI> This was pro|bably
the invention of &s;ome epigrammati&s;t; and yet
every one, from his own experience, may be able
to recollect almost as &s;trong in&s;tances of per&s;everance
in avarice. 'Tis commonly reported of a famous
mi&s;er in this city, that finding him&s;elf near death,
he &s;ent for &s;ome of the magi&s;trates, and gave them
a bill of an hundred pounds, payable after his de|cea&s;e;
which &s;um he intended &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed
of in charitable u&s;es; but &s;carce were they gone,
<PB N="137" REF="136">
when he orders them to be called back, and offers
them ready money, if they would abate five pounds
of the &s;um. Another noted mi&s;er in the north, in|tending
to defraud his heirs, and leave his fortune
to the building an ho&s;pital, protracted the drawing
of his will from day to day; and 'tis thought, that
if tho&s;e intere&s;ted in it had not paid for the draw|ing
it, he had died inte&s;tate. In &s;hort, none of the
mo&s;t furious exce&s;&s;es of love and ambition are in any
re&s;pet to be compared to the extremes of avarice.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t excu&s;e that can be made for avarice is,
that it generally prevails in old men, or in men of
cold tempers, where all the other affections are ex|tinct;
and the mind being incapable of remaining
without some pa&s;&s;ion or pur&s;uit, at la&s;t find out this
mon&s;trou&s;ly ab&s;urd one, which &s;uits the coldne&s;s and
inactivity of its temper. At the &s;ame time, it &s;eems
very extraordinary, that &s;o fro&s;ty, &s;piritle&s;s a pa&s;&s;ion
&s;hould be able to carry us farther than all the warmth
of youth and plea&s;ure. But if we look more nar|rowly
into the matter, we &s;hall find, that this very
circum&s;tance renders the explication of the ca&s;e more
ea&s;y. When the temper is warm and full of vi|gour,
it naturally &s;hoots out more ways than one,
and produces inferior pa&s;&s;ions to counter-balance, in
&s;ome degree, its predominant inclination. 'Tis im|po&s;&s;ible
for a per&s;on of that temper, however bent
on any pur&s;uit, to be deprived of all &s;en&s;e of &s;hame,
<PB N="138" REF="137">
or all regard to the &s;entiments of mankind. His
friends mu&s;t have &s;ome influence over him: And other
con&s;iderations are apt to have their weight. All this
&s;erves to re&s;train him within &s;ome bounds. But 'tis
no wonder that the avaritious man, being, from the
coldne&s;s of his temper, without regard to reputation,
to friend&s;hip, or to plea&s;ure, &s;hould be carried &s;o far
by his prevailing inclination, and &s;hould di&s;play his
paffion in &s;uch &s;urprizing in&s;tances.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY we find no vice &s;o irreclaimable
as avarice: And tho' there &s;carcely has been a mo|rali&s;t
or philo&s;opher, from the beginning of the world
to this day, who has not levelled a &s;troke at it, we
hardly find a &s;ingle in&s;tance of any per&s;on's being
cured of it. For this rea&s;on, I am more apt to ap|prove
of tho&s;e, who attack it with wit and humour,
than of tho&s;e who treat it in a &s;erious manner. There
being &s;o little hopes of doing good to the people
infected with this vice, I would have the re&s;t of man|kind,
at lea&s;t, diverted by our manner of expo&s;ing
it: As indeed there is no kind of diver&s;ion, of which
they &s;eem &s;o willing to partake.</P>
<P>AMONG the fables of <HI>Mon&s;ieur de la</HI> MOTTE, there
is one levelled again&s;t avarice, which &s;eems to me
more natural and ea&s;y, than mo&s;t of the fables of
that ingenious author. A mi&s;er, &s;ays he, being dead,
and fairly interred, came to the banks of the STYX,
<PB N="139" REF="138">
de&s;iring to be ferried over along with the other gho&s;ts.
CHARON demands his fare, and is &s;urprized to &s;ee
the mi&s;er, rather than pay it, throw him&s;elf into the
river, and &s;wim over the other &s;ide, notwith&s;tand|ing
all the clamour and oppo&s;ition that could be
made to him. All hell was in an uproar; and each
of the judges was meditating &s;ome puni&s;hment, &s;uit|able
to a crime of &s;uch dangerous con&s;equence to the
infernal revenues. Shall he be chained to the rock
with PROMETHEUS? Or tremble below the preci|pice
in company with the DANAIDES? Or a&s;&s;i&s;t SI|SYPHUS
in rolling his &s;tone? No, &s;ays MINOS, none
of the&s;e. We mu&s;t invent &s;ome &s;everer puni&s;hment.
Let him be &s;ent back to the earth, to &s;ee the u&s;e his
heirs are making of his riches.</P>
<P>I HOPE it will not be interpreted as a de&s;ign of
&s;etting my&s;elf in oppo&s;ition to this celebrated author,
if I proceed to deliver a fable of my own, which is
intended to expo&s;e the &s;ame vice of avarice. The
hint of it was taken from the&s;e lines of Mr. POPE.</P>

<P>OUR old mother Earth once lodged in indictment
again&s;t AVARICE before the courts of heaven, for her
wicked and malicious council and advice, in tempting,
inducing, per&s;uading, and traiterou&s;ly &s;educing the
<PB N="140" REF="139">
children of the plaintiff to commit the dete&s;table
crime of parricide upon her, and, mangling her body,
ran&s;ack her very bowels for hidden trea&s;ure. The
indictment was very long and verbo&s;e; but we mu&s;t
omit a great part of the repetitions and &s;ynonymous
terms, not to tire our readers too much with our tale.
AVARICE, being called before JUPITER to an&s;wer to
this charge, had not much to &s;ay in her own defence.
The injury was clearly proved upon her. The fact,
indeed, was notorious, and the injury had been fre|quently
repeated. When therefore the plaintiff de|manded
ju&s;tice, JUPITER very readily gave &s;entence
in her favour; and his decree was to this purpo&s;e,
That &s;ince dame <HI>Avarice,</HI> the de&s;endant, had thus
grievou&s;ly injured dame <HI>Earth,</HI> the plaintiff, &s;he was
hereby ordered to take that trea&s;ure, of which &s;he had
feloniou&s;ly robbed the &s;aid plaintiff, by ran&s;acking
her bo&s;om, and in the &s;ame manner, as before, open|ing
her bo&s;om, re&s;tore it back to her, without dimu|nition
to retention. From this &s;entence, it &s;hall fol|low,
&s;ays JUPITER to the by-&s;tanders, That, in all
future ages, the retainers of <HI>Avarice</HI> &s;hall bury and
conceal their riches, and thereby re&s;tore to the earth
what they took from her.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the DIGNITY OF HUMAN NATURE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are certain &s;ects, which &s;ecretly form
them&s;elves in the learned world, as well as
in the political; and tho' &s;ometimes they come not
to an open rupture, yet they give a different turn
to the ways of thinking of tho&s;e who have taken
party on either &s;ide. The mo&s;t remarkable of this
kind are the &s;ects, that are founded on the different
&s;entiments with regard to the <HI>dignity of human na|ture;</HI>
which is a point that &s;eems to have divided
philo&s;ophers and poets, as well as divines, from the
beginning of the world to this day. Some exalt our
&s;pecies to the &s;kies, and repre&s;ent man as a kind of
human demi-god, who derives his origin from hea|ven,
and retains evident marks of his lineage and
de&s;cent. Others in&s;i&s;t upon the blind &s;ides of
human nature, and can di&s;cover nothing, except va|nity,
in which man &s;urpa&s;&s;es the other animals, whom
he affects &s;o much to de&s;pi&s;e. If an author po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
the talent of rhetoric, and declamation, he com|monly
<PB N="142" REF="141">
takes party with the former: If his turn lies
towards irony and ridicule, he naturally throws him|&s;elf
into the other extreme.</P>
<P>I AM far from thinking, that all tho&s;e, who have
depreciated human nature have been enemies to vir|tue,
and have expo&s;ed the frailties of their fellow-creatures
with any bad intention. On the contrary,
I am &s;en&s;ible, that a very delicate &s;en&s;e of morals,
e&s;pecially when attended with &s;omewhat of the <HI>Mi|&s;anthrope,</HI>
is apt to give a man a di&s;gu&s;t of the world,
and to make him con&s;ider the common cour&s;e of hu|man
affairs with too much &s;pleen and indignation.
I must, however, be of opinion, that the &s;entiments
of tho&s;e, who are inclined to think favourably of
mankind, are much more advantageous to virtue,
than the contrary principles which give us a mean
opinion of our nature. When a man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
a high notion of his rank and character in the crea|tion,
he will naturally endeavour to act up to it,
and will &s;corn to do a ba&s;e or vicious action, which
might &s;ink him below that figure which he makes
in his own imagination. Accordingly we find, that
all our polite and fa&s;hionable morali&s;ts in&s;i&s;t upon this
topic, and endeavour to repre&s;ent vice as unworthy
of man, as well as odious in it&s;elf.</P>
<P>WOMEN are generally much more flattered in their
youth than men; which may proceed from this rea|&s;on,
<PB N="143" REF="142">
among others, that their chief point of honour
is con&s;idered as much more difficult than ours, and
requires to be &s;upported by all that decent pride,
which can be in&s;tilled into them.</P>
<P>WE find very few di&s;putes which are not found|ed
on &s;ome ambiguity in the expre&s;&s;ion; and I am
per&s;uaded, that the pre&s;ent di&s;pute concerning the
dignity of human nature, is not more exempt from
it than any other. It may, therefore, be worth while
to con&s;ider, what is real, and what is only verbal
in this controver&s;y.</P>
<P>THAT there is a natural difference betwixt merit
and demerit, virtue and vice, wi&s;dom and folly, no
rea&s;onable man will deny: but yet 'tis evident, that
in affixing the term, which denotes either our ap|probation
or blame, we are commonly more influenced
by compari&s;on than by any fixt unalterable &s;tandard
in the nature of things. In like manner, quantity,
and exten&s;ion, and bulk, are by every one acknow|ledged
to be real things: But when we call any ani|mal
<HI>great</HI> or <HI>little,</HI> we always form a &s;ecret compa|ri&s;on
between that animal and others of the &s;ame
&s;pecies; and 'tis that compari&s;on which regulates our
judgment concerning its greatne&s;s. A dog and a
hor&s;e may be of the very &s;ame &s;ize, while the
one is admired for the greatne&s;s of its bulk, and
the other for the &s;mallne&s;s. When I am pre|&s;ent,
<PB N="144" REF="143">
therefore, at any di&s;pute, I always con&s;ider with
my&s;elf, whether it be a que&s;tion of compari&s;on or
not that is the &s;ubject of the controver&s;y; and if it
be, whether the di&s;putants compare the &s;ame objects
together, or talk of things that are widely different.
As the latter is commonly the ca&s;e, I have long &s;ince
learnt to neglect &s;uch di&s;putes as manife&s;t abu&s;es of
lei&s;ure, the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent that could be made
to mortals.</P>
<P>IN forming our notions of human nature, we are
very apt to make a compari&s;on betwixt men and ani|mals,
which are the only creatures endowed with
thought that fall under our &s;en&s;es. Certainly this
compari&s;on is very favourable to mankind. On the
one hand we &s;ee a creature, who&s;e thoughts are not li|mited
by any narrow bounds, either of place or time;
who carries his re&s;earches into the mo&s;t di&s;tant re|gions
of this globe, and beyond this globe, to the
planets and heavenly bodies; looks backward to con|&s;ider
the fir&s;t origin of human race; ca&s;ts his eyes
forward to &s;ee the influence of his actions upon po&s;|terity,
and the judgments which will be formed of
his character a thou&s;and years hence; a creature, who
traces cau&s;es and effects to a great length and in|tricacy;
extracts general principles from particular
appearances; improves upon his di&s;coveries; corrects
his mi&s;takes; and makes his very errors profitable.
On the other hand, we are pre&s;ented with a crea|ture
<PB N="145" REF="144">
the very rever&s;e of this; limited in its ob&s;er|vations
and rea&s;onings to a very few &s;en&s;ible objects
which &s;urround it; without curio&s;ity, without fore|fight;
blindly conducted by in&s;tinct, and attaining
in a very &s;hort time, its utmo&s;t perfection, beyond
which it is never able to advance a &s;ingle &s;tep. What
a wide difference is there betwixt the&s;e creatures! And
how exalted a notion mu&s;t we entertain of the former,
in compari&s;on of the latter!</P>
<P>THERE are two means commonly employed to
de&s;troy this conclu&s;ion: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By making an unfair
repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e, and in&s;i&s;ting only upon
the weakne&s;&s;es of human nature. And <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> By
forming a new and &s;ecret compari&s;on between man
and beings of the mo&s;t perfect wi&s;dom. Among the
other excellencies of man, this is remarkable, that
he can form an idea of perfections much beyond
what he has experience of in him&s;elf; and is not
limited in his conception of wi&s;dom and virtue. He can
ea&s;ily exalt his notions and conceive a degree of knowlege,
which, when compared to his own, will make
the latter appear very contemptible, and will cau&s;e
the difference betwixt that and the &s;agacity of ani|mals,
in a manner, to di&s;appear and vani&s;h. Now
this being a point, in which all the world is agreed,
that human under&s;tanding falls infinitely &s;hort of per|fect
wi&s;dom; 'tis proper we &s;hould know when this
compari&s;on takes place, that we may not di&s;pute, where
there is no real difference in our &s;entiments. Man falls
<PB N="146" REF="145">
much &s;horter of perfect wi&s;dom, and even of his own
ideas of perfect wi&s;dom, than animals do of man;
but yet the latter difference is &s;o con&s;iderable, that no|thing
but a compari&s;on with the former, can make it
appcar of little moment.</P>
<P>&startq;TIS al&s;o very u&s;ual to <HI>compare</HI> one man with an|other;
and finding very few whom we can call <HI>wi&s;e</HI> or
<HI>virtuous,</HI> we are apt to entertain a contemptible notion
of our &s;pecies in general. That we may be &s;en&s;ible
of the fallacy of this way of rea&s;oning, we may ob|&s;erve,
that the honourable appellations of wi&s;e and
virtuous, are not annexed to any particular degree of
tho&s;e qualities of <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>virtue;</HI> but ari&s;e altogether
from the compari&s;on we make betwixt one man and
another. When we find a man, who arrives at &s;uch a
pitch of wi&s;dom as is very uncommon, we pronounce
him a wi&s;e man: So that to &s;ay, there are few wi&s;e
men in the world, is really to &s;ay nothing; &s;ince 'tis
only by their &s;carcity, that they merit that ap|pellation.
Were the lowe&s;t of our &s;pecies as wi&s;e
as TULLY, or my lord BACON, we &s;hould &s;till have
rea&s;on to &s;ay, that there are few wi&s;e men. For
in that ca&s;e we &s;hould exalt our notions of wi&s;dom,
and &s;hould not pay a &s;ingular honour to any one,
who was not &s;ingularly di&s;tingui&s;hed by his talents.
In like manner, I have heard it ob&s;erved by thought|le&s;s
people, that there are few women po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
beauty, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e who want it; not con|&s;idering,
that we be&s;tow the epithet of <HI>beautiful</HI> only
<PB N="147" REF="146">
on &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s a degree of beauty, that is com|mon
to them with a few. The &s;ame degree of beauty
in a woman is called deformity, which is treated as
real beauty in one of our &s;ex.</P>
<P>AS 'tis u&s;ual, in forming a notion of our &s;pecies,
to <HI>compare</HI> it with the other &s;pecies above or below
it, or to compare the individuals of the &s;pecies a|mong
them&s;elves; &s;o we often compare together the
different motives or actuating principles of human
nature, in order to regulate our judgment concern|ing
it. And indeed, this is the only kind of com|pari&s;on
which is worth our attention, or decides any
thing in the pre&s;ent que&s;tion. Were our &s;elfi&s;h and
vicious principles &s;o much predominant above our
&s;ocial and virtuous, as is a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome philo&s;o|phers,
we ought undoubtedly to entertain a contemp|tible
notion of human nature.</P>
<P>THERE is much of a di&s;pute of words in all this
controver&s;y. When a man denies the &s;incerity of all
public &s;pirit or affection to a country and commu|nity,
I am at a lo&s;s what to think of him. Per|haps
he never felt this pa&s;&s;ion in &s;o clear and di&s;|tinct
a manner as to remove all his doubts concern|ing
its force and reality. But when he proceeds
afterwards to reject all private friend&s;hip, if no in|tere&s;t
or &s;elf-love intermixes it&s;elf; I am then con|fident
that he abu&s;es terms, and confounds the ideas
of things; &s;ince it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to be
<PB N="148" REF="147">
&s;o &s;elfi&s;h, or rather &s;o &s;tupid, as to make no diffe|rence
between one man and another, and give no
preference to qualities, which engage his approba|tion
and e&s;teem. Is he al&s;o, &s;ay I, as in&s;en&s;ible to
anger as he pre$ends to be to friend&s;hip? And does
injury and wrong no more affect him than kind|ne&s;s
or benefits? Impo&s;&s;ible: He does not know him|&s;elf:
He has forgot the movements of his mind;
or rather he makes u&s;e of a different language from
the re&s;t of his countrymen, and calls not things
by their proper names. What &s;ay you of natural
affection? (I &s;ubjoin) Is that al&s;o a &s;pecies of &s;elf-love?
Yes: All is &s;elf-love. <HI>Your</HI> children are loved
only becau&s;e they are yours: <HI>Your</HI> friend for a like
rea&s;on: And <HI>your</HI> country engages you only &s;o far
as it has a connexion with <HI>your&s;elf.</HI> Were the idea
of &s;elf removed, nothing would affect you: You would
be altogether inactive and in&s;en&s;ible: Or if you ever
gave your&s;elf any movement, it would only be from
vanity, and a de&s;ire of fame and reputation to this
&s;ame &s;elf. I am willing, reply I, to receive your in|terpretation
of human actions, provided you admit
the facts. That &s;pecies of &s;elf-love, which di&s;plays
it&s;elf in kindne&s;s to others, you mu&s;t allow to have
great influence, and even greater, on many occa&s;ions,
than that which remains in its original &s;hape and
form. For how few are there, who, having a family,
children, and relations, do not &s;pend more on the
maintenance and education of the&s;e than on their own
<PB N="149" REF="148">
plea&s;ures? This, indeed, you ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, may pro|ceed
from their &s;elf-love, &s;ince the pro&s;perity of their
family and friends is one, or the chief of their plea|&s;ures,
as well as their chief honour. Be you al&s;o
one of the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h men, and you are &s;ure of every
one's good opinion and good will; or not to &s;hock
your nice ears with the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, the &s;elf-love of
every one, and mine among&s;t the re&s;t, will then in|cline
us to &s;erve you, and &s;peak well of you.</P>
<P>IN my opinion, there are two things which have
led a&s;tray tho&s;e philo&s;ophers, who have in&s;i&s;ted &s;o
much on the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of man. In the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place,
they found, that every act of virtue or friend&s;hip was
attended with a &s;ecret plea&s;ure: from whence they
concluded, that friend&s;hip and virtue could not be
difintere&s;ted. But the fallacy of this is obvious. The
virtuous &s;entiment or pa&s;&s;ion produces the plea&s;ure,
and does not ari&s;e from it. I feel a plea&s;ure in doing
good to my friend, becau&s;e I love him; but do not
love him for the &s;ake of that plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, it has always been found, that the
virtuous are far from being indifferent to prai&s;e; and
therefore they have been repre&s;ented as a &s;et of vain-glorious
men, who had nothing in view but the ap|p$au&s;es
of others. But this al&s;o is a fallacy. 'Tis very
unju&s;t in the world, when they find any tincture of
vanity in a laudable action, to depreciate it upon that
<PB N="150" REF="149">
account, or a&s;cribe it entirely to that motive. The
cafe is not the &s;ame with vanity, as with other pa&s;|&s;ions.
Where avarice or revenge enters into any
&s;eemingly virtuous action, 'tis difficult for us to de|termine
how far it enters, and 'tis natural to &s;uppo&s;e
it the &s;ole actuating principle. But vanity is &s;o clo&s;e|ly
allied to virtue, and to love the fame of laudable
actions approaches &s;o near the love of laudable actions
for their own &s;ake, that the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are more capa|ble
of mixture, than any other kinds of affection; and
'tis almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to have the latter without &s;ome
degree of the former. Accordingly we find, that this
pa&s;&s;ion for glory is always warped and varied accord|ing
to the particular ta&s;te or &s;entiment of the mind
on which it falls. NERO had the &s;ame vanity in driv|ing
a chariot, that TRAJAN had in governing the
empire with ju&s;tice and ability. To love the glory of
virtuous actions is a &s;ure proof of the love of virtuous
actions.</P>

<P>THOSE who employ their pens on political
&s;ubjects, free from party-rage, and party pre|judices,
cultivate a &s;cience, which, of all others, con|tributes
mo&s;t to public utility, and even to the pri|vate
&s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who addict them&s;elves to the
&s;tudy of it. I am apt, however, to entertain a &s;u&s;|picion,
that the world is &s;till too young to fix many
general truths in politics, which will remain true to
the late&s;t po&s;terity. We have not as yet had ex|perience
of above three thou&s;and years; &s;o that not
only the art of rea&s;oning is &s;till defective in this &s;ci|ence,
as well as in all others, but we even want &s;uf|ficient
materials upon which we can rea&s;on. 'Tis not
fully known, what degrees of refinement, either in
virtue or vice, human nature is &s;u&s;ceptible of; nor,
what may be expected of mankind from any great
revolution in their education, cu&s;toms or principles.
MACHIAVEL was certainly a great genius; but hav|ing
<PB N="152" REF="151">
confined his &s;tudy to the furious and tyrannical
governments of ancient times, or to the little di&s;or|derly
principalities of ITALY, his rea&s;onings, e&s;pe|cially
upon monarchical government, have been found
extremely defective; and there &s;carce is any maxim
in his <HI>prince,</HI> which &s;ub&s;equent experience has not en|tirely
refuted. <HI>A weak prince,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>is incapable
of receiving good coun&s;el; for if he con&s;ult with &s;eve|ral,
he will not be able to choo&s;e among their different
coun&s;els. If he abandon him&s;elf to one, that mini&s;ter
may, perhaps, have capacity; but he will not be long
a mini&s;ter: He will be &s;ure to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s his ma&s;ter, and
place him&s;elf and his family upon the throne.</HI> I men|tion
this, among innumerable in&s;tances, of the errors
of that politician, proceeding, in a great mea&s;ure, from
his having lived in too early an age of the world, to
be a good judge of political truth. Almo&s;t all the
princes of EUROPE are at pre&s;ent governed by their
mini&s;ters; and have been &s;o for near two centuries;
and yet no &s;uch event has ever happened, or can po&s;|&s;ibly
happen. SEJANUS might project dethroning
the CAESARS; but FLEURY, tho' ever &s;o vicious, could
not, while in his &s;en&s;es, entertain the lea&s;t hopes of
di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the BOURBONS.</P>
<P>TRADE was never e&s;teemed an affair of &s;tate, 'till
the la&s;t century; and there &s;carcely is any ancient

Even the ITALIANS have kept a profound &s;ilence
with regard to it; tho' it has now excited the chief
attention, as well of mini&s;ters of &s;tate, as of &s;pecu|lative
rea&s;oners. The great opulence, grandeur, and
military atchievements of the two maritime powers,
&s;eem fir&s;t to have in&s;tructed mankind in the va&s;t im|portance
of an exten&s;ive commerce.</P>
<P>HAVING, therefore, intended in this e&s;&s;ay to have
made a full compari&s;on of civil liberty and ab&s;olute
government, and to have &s;hewn the great advantages
of the former above the latter; I began to entertain
a &s;u&s;picion, that no man in this age was &s;ufficiently
qualified for &s;uch an undertaking; and that whatever
any one &s;hould advance on that head would, in all
probability, be refuted by further experience, and be
rejected by po&s;terity. Such mighty revolutions have
happened in human affairs, and &s;o many events have
ari&s;en contrary to the expectation of the ancients, that
they are &s;ufficient to beget the &s;u&s;picion of &s;till further
changes.</P>
<P>IT had been ob&s;erved by the ancients, that all the
arts and &s;ciences aro&s;e among free nations; and, that
<PB N="154" REF="153">
the PERSIANS and EGYPTIANS, notwith&s;tanding all
their ea&s;e, opulence and luxury, made but faint ef|forts
towards a reli&s;h in tho&s;e finer plea&s;ures, which
were carried to &s;uch perfection by the GREEKS,
amid&s;t continual wars, attended with poverty, and
the greate&s;t &s;implicity of life and manners. It had
al&s;o been ob&s;erved, that as the GREEKS lo&s;t their
liberty, tho' they encrea&s;ed mightily in riches, by
means of the conque&s;t of ALEXANDER; yet the arts,
from that moment, declined among them, and have
never &s;ince been able to rai&s;e their head in that cli|mate.
Learning was tran&s;planted to ROME, the only
free nation at that time in the univer&s;e; and having
met with &s;o favourable a &s;oil, it made prodigious
&s;hoots for above a century; till the decay of liberty
produced al&s;o the decay of letters, and &s;pread a total
barbari&s;m over the world. From the&s;e two experi|ments,
of which each was double in its kind, and
&s;hewed the fall of learning in de&s;potic governments,
as well as its ri&s;e in popular ones, LONGINUS thought
him&s;elf &s;ufficiently ju&s;tified, in a&s;&s;erting, that the arts
and &s;ciences could never flouri&s;h, but in a free go|vernment:
and in this opinion, he has been followed
by &s;everal eminent writers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mr. ADDISON and lord SHAFTESBURY.</NOTE> in our own country, who
either confined their view merely to ancient facts, or
entertained too great a partiality in favour of that form
of government, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="154">
BUT what would the&s;e writers have &s;aid, to the in|&s;tances
of modern ROME and of FLORENCE? Of which
the former carried to perfection all the finer arts of
&s;culpture, painting and mu&s;ic, as well as poetry, tho'
they groaned under tyranny, and under the tyranny
of prie&s;ts: While the latter made the greate&s;t pro|gre&s;s
in the arts and &s;ciences, after they began to lo&s;e
their liberty by the u&s;urpations of the family of ME|DICIS.
ARIOSTO, TASSO, GALLILAEO, no more
than RAPHAEL, and MICHAEL ANGELO, were not
born in republics. And tho' the LOMBARD &s;chool
was famous as well as the ROMAN, yet the VENE|TIANS
have had the &s;malle&s;t &s;hare in its honours, and
&s;eem rather inferior to the other ITALIANS, in their
genius for the arts and &s;ciences. RUBENS e&s;tabli&s;hed
his &s;chool at ANTWERP, not at AMSTERDAM; DRES|DEN,
not HAMBURGH, is the centre of politene&s;s in
GERMANY.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t eminent in&s;tance of the flouri&s;hing
of learning in de&s;potic governments, is that of
FRANCE, which &s;carce ever enjoyed any e&s;tabli&s;hed
liberty, and yet has carried the arts and &s;ciences as
near perfection as any other nation. The ENGLISH
are, perhaps, better philo&s;ophers; the ITALIANS
better painters and mu&s;icians; the ROMANS were great|er
orators: But the FRENCH are the only people,
except the GREEKS, who have been at once philo&s;o|phers,
poets, orators, hi&s;torians, painters, architects,
<PB N="156" REF="155">
&s;culptors, and mu&s;icians. With regard to the &s;tage,
they have excelled even the GREEKS, who have far
excelled the ENGLISH. And, in common life, they
have, in a great mea&s;ure, perfected that art, the mo&s;t
u&s;eful and agreeable of any, <HI>$ Art de Vivre,</HI> the art
of &s;ociety and conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the &s;tate of the &s;ciences and polite
arts in our own country, HORACE'S ob&s;ervation, with
regard to the ROMANS, may, in a great mea&s;ure, be

<P>THE elegance and propriety of &s;tile have been very
much neglected among us. We have no dictionary

The fir&s;t polite pro&s;e we have, was wrote by a man
who is &s;till alive<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. SWIFT.</NOTE>. As to SPRAT, LOCKE, and even

&s;tiff and pedantic; tho' their &s;en&s;e be excellent. Men,

that they had no reli&s;h for the &s;eemingly minute
ob&s;ervations of grammar and critici&s;m. And tho'
<PB N="157" REF="156">
this turn of thinking mu&s;t have con&s;iderably improved
our &s;en&s;e and our talent of rea&s;oning beyond tho&s;e of
other nations; it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that even in tho&s;e
&s;ciences above-mentioned, we have not any &s;tandard-book,
which we can tran&s;mit to po&s;terity: And the
utmo&s;t we have to boa&s;t of, are a few e&s;&s;ays towards
a more ju&s;t philo&s;ophy; which, indeed, promi&s;e very
much, but have not, as yet, reached any degree of
perfection.</P>
<P>IT has become an e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion, that com|merce
can never flouri&s;h but in a free government;
and this opinion &s;eems to be founded on a longer and
larger experience than the foregoing, with regard to
the arts and &s;ciences. If we trace commerce in its pro|gre&s;s
thro' TYRE, ATHENS, SYRACUSE, CARTHAGE,
VENICE, FLORENCE, GENOA, ANTWERP, HOLLAND,
ENGLAND, &amp;c. we &s;hall always find it to have fixt its
&s;eat in free governments. The three greate&s;t trading
towns now in the world, are LONDON, AMSTER|DAM,

cities; that is, enjoying a double liberty. It
mu&s;t, however, be ob&s;erved, that the great jea|lou&s;y
entertained of late, with regard to the com|merce
of FRANCE, &s;eems to prove, that this maxim
is no more certain and infallible, than the foregoing,
and that the &s;ubjects of an ab&s;olute prince may become
our rivals in commerce, as well as in learning.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="157">
DURST I deliver my opinion in an affair of &s;o
much uncertainty, I would a&s;&s;ert, that, notwith&s;tand|ing
the efforts of the FRENCH, there is &s;omething
pernicious to commerce inherent in the very nature of
ab&s;olute government, and in&s;eparable from it: Tho'
the rea&s;on I would a&s;&s;ign for this opinion, is &s;ome|what
different from that which is commonly in&s;i&s;ted
on. Private property &s;eems to me almo&s;t as &s;ecure in
a civilized EUROPEAN monarchy, as in a republic;
nor is danger much apprehended in &s;uch a govern|ment,
from the violence of the &s;overeign; more than
we commonly dread harm from thunder, or earth|quakes,
or any accident the mo&s;t unu&s;ual and extra|ordinary.
Avarice, the &s;pur of indu&s;try, is &s;o ob&s;ti|nate
a pa&s;&s;ion, and works its way thro' &s;o many real
dangers and difficulties, that 'tis not likely it will be
&s;cared by an imaginary danger, which is &s;o &s;mall,
that it &s;carce admits of calculation. Commerce there|fore,
in my opinion, is apt to decay in ab&s;olute go|vernments,
not becau&s;e it is there le&s;s <HI>&s;ecure,</HI> but be|cau&s;e
it is le&s;s <HI>honourable.</HI> A &s;ubordination of ranks
is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of monarchy.
Birth, titles, and place, mu&s;t be honoured above in|du&s;try
and riches. And while the&s;e notions prevail,
all the con&s;iderable traders will be tempted to throw
up their commerce, in order to purcha&s;e &s;ome of tho&s;e
employments, to which privileges and honours are
annexed.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="158">
SINCE I am upon this head of the alterations which
time has produced, or may produce in politics, I
mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that all kinds of government, free and
de&s;potic, &s;eem to have undergone, in modern times,
a great change to the better, with regard both to fo|reign
and dome&s;tic management. The <HI>balance of
power</HI> is a &s;ecret in politics, fully known only to
the pre&s;ent age; and I mu&s;t add, that the internal
POLICE of the &s;tate has al&s;o received great improve|ments
within the la&s;t century. We are informed by
SALLUST, that CATALINE'S army was much aug|mented
by the acce&s;&s;ion of the highwaymen about.
ROME; tho' I believe, that all of that profe&s;&s;ion, who
are at pre&s;ent di&s;per&s;ed over EUROPE, would not
amount to a regiment. In CICERO'S pleadings for
MILO, I find this argument, among others, made u&s;e
of to prove, that his client had not a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated CLO|DIUS.
Had MILO, &s;aid he, intended to have killed
CLODIUS, he had not attacked him in the day time,
and at &s;uch a di&s;tance from the city: He had way|laid
him at night, near the &s;uburbs, where it might
have been pretended, that he was killed by robbers;
and the frequency of the accident would have fa|voured
the deceit. This is a &s;urprizing proof of the
loo&s;e police of ROME, and of the number and force
of the&s;e robbers; &s;ince CLODIUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide A&s;c. Ped. in Orat. pro Milone.</NOTE> was at that time
attended with thirty &s;laves, who were compleatly arm|ed,
<PB N="160" REF="159">
and &s;ufficiently accu&s;tomed to blood and danger
in the frequent tumults excited by that &s;editious tri|bune.</P>
<P>BUT tho' all kinds of government be improved in
modern times, yet monarchical government &s;eems to
have made the greate&s;t advances towards perfection.
It may now be affirmed of civilized monarchies,
what was formerly &s;aid in prai&s;e of republics alone,
<HI>that they are a government of Laws, not of men.</HI> They
are found &s;u&s;ceptible of order, method, and con&s;tancy,
to a &s;urprizing degree. Property is there &s;ecure; in|du&s;try
encouraged; the arts flouri&s;h; and the prince
lives &s;ecure among his &s;ubjects, like a father among
his children. There are perhaps, and have been for
two centuries, near two hundred ab&s;olute princes,
great and &s;mall, in EUROPE; and allowing twenty
years to each reign, we may &s;uppo&s;e, that there have
been in the whole two thou&s;and monarchs or tyrants,
as the GREEKS would have called them: Yet of the&s;e
there has not been one, note even PHILIP II. of SPAIN,
&s;o bad as TIEERIUS, CALIGULA, NERO, or DOMI|TIAN,
who were &s;our in twelve amon&s;t the ROMAN
emperors. It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed, that tho'
monarchical governments have approached nearer to
popular ones, in gentlene&s;s and &s;tability; they are
&s;till much inferior. Our modern education and cu&s;|toms
in&s;til more humanity and moderation than the
<PB N="161" REF="160">
ancient; but have not as yet been able to overcome
entirely the di&s;advantages of that form of govern|ment.</P>
<P>BUT here I mu&s;t beg leave to advance a conjecture,
which &s;eems very probable, but which po&s;terity alone
can fully judge of. I am apt to think, that in mo|narchical
governments there is a &s;ource of improve|ment,
and in popular governments a &s;ource of dege|neracy,
which in time will bring the&s;e &s;pecies of go|vernment
&s;till nearer an equality. The greate&s;t abu&s;es
which ari&s;e in FRANCE, the mo&s;t perfect model of
pure monarchy, proceed not from the number or
weight of the taxes, beyond what are to be met with
in free countries; but from the expen&s;ive, une|qual,
arbitrary, and intricate method of levying them,
by which the indu&s;try of the poor, e&s;pecially of the
pea&s;ants and farmers, is, in a great mea&s;ure, di&s;cou|raged,
and agriculture rendered a beggarly and &s;lavi&s;h
employment. But to who&s;e advantage do the&s;e abu&s;es
tend? If to that of the nobility, they might be
e&s;teemed inherent in that form of government; &s;ince
the nobility are the true &s;upports of monarchy; and
'tis $word$ their intere&s;t &s;hould be more con&s;ulted,
in &s;uch a con&s;titution, than that of the people. But
the nobility are, in reality, the principal lo&s;ers by
this oppre&s;&s;ion; &s;ince it ruins their e&s;tates, and beg|gars
their tenants. The only gainers by it are the
<HI>Finan&ccedil;iers,</HI> a race of men rather odious to the nobi|lity
<PB N="162" REF="161">
and the whole kingdom. If a prince or mini&s;ter,
therefore, &s;hould ari&s;e endowed with &s;ufficient di&s;cern|ment
to know his own and the public intere&s;t, and
with &s;ufficient force of mind to break thro' ancient
cu&s;toms, we might expect to &s;ee the&s;e abu&s;es reme|died;
in which ca&s;e, the difference betwixt their ab|&s;olute
government and our free one, would not appear
&s;o con&s;iderable as at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE &s;ource of degeneracy, which may be remark|ed
in free governments, con&s;i&s;ts in the practice of con|tracting
debt, and mortgaging the public revenues,
by which taxes may, in time, become altogether in|tolerable,
and all the property of the &s;tate be brought
into the hands of the public. This practice is of
modern date. The ATHENIANS, tho' governed by
a republic, paid near two hundred <HI>per Cent.</HI> for tho&s;e
&s;ums of money, which any emergent occa&s;ion made
it nece&s;&s;ary for them to borrow; as we learn from
XENOPHON<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. Among the moderns, the DUTCH
fir&s;t introduced the practice of borrowing great &s;ums
at low intere&s;t, and have well nigh ruined them&s;elves
by it. Ab&s;olute princes have al&s;o contracted debt;
but as an ab&s;olute prince may play the bankrupt when
<PB N="163" REF="162">
he plea&s;es, his people can never be oppre&s;t by his
debts. In popular governments, the people, and
chiefly tho&s;e who have the highe&s;t offices, being com|monly
the public creditors, 'tis difficult for the &s;tate
to make u&s;e of this remedy, which, however it may
be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary, is always cruel and barbarous.
This, therefore, &s;eems to be an inconvenience, which
nearly threatens all free governments; e&s;pecially our
own, at the pre&s;ent juncture of affairs. And what a
&s;trong motive is this, to increa&s;e our frugality of the
public money; le&s;t, for want of it, we be reduced,
by the multiplicity of taxes, to cur&s;e our free govern|ment,
and wi&s;h our&s;elves in the &s;ame &s;tate of &s;ervi|tude
with all the nations that &s;urround us?</P>

<P>THOSE, who con&s;ider the periods and revo|lutions

hi&s;tory there is found a much greater uniformity than
in the hi&s;tory of learning and &s;cience, and that the
wars, negotiations, and politics of one age re&s;emble
more tho&s;e of another, than the ta&s;te, wit, and &s;pe|culative
principles. Intere&s;t and ambition, honour
and &s;hame, friend&s;hip and enmity, gratitude and re|venge,
are the prime movers in all public tran&s;ac|tions;
and the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are of a very &s;tubborn and
intractable nature, in compari&s;on of the &s;entiments

<PB N="166" REF="164">
to the ROMANS, in ta&s;te and &s;cience, than in
courage and virtue.</P>
<P>BUT not to compare together nations &s;o widely
different, that they may almo&s;t be e&s;teemed of a dif|ferent
&s;pecies; it may be ob&s;erved, that even this
latter period of human learning, is, in many re&s;pects,
of an oppo&s;ite character to the ancient; and that if
we be &s;uperior in philo&s;opy, we are &s;till, notwith|&s;tanding
all our refinements, much inferior in elo|quence.</P>
<P>IN ancient times, no work of genius was thought
to require &s;o great parts and capacity, as the &s;peak|ing
in public; and &s;ome eminent writers have pro|nounced
the talents, even of a great poet or philo|&s;opher,
to be of an inferior nature to tho&s;e requi&s;ite
for &s;uch an undertaking. GREECE and ROME pro|duced,
each of them, but one accompli&s;hed orator;
and whatever prai&s;es the other celebrated &s;peakers
might merit, they were &s;till e&s;teemed much inferior to
the&s;e great models of eloquence. 'Tis ob&s;ervable,
that the ancient critics could &s;care find two orators in
any age, who de&s;erved to be placed preci&s;ely in the
&s;ame rank, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame degree of merit.
CALVUS, CAELIUS, CURIO, HORTENSIUS, CAESAR
ro&s;e one above another: But the greate&s;t of that age
was inferior to CICERO, the mo&s;t eloquent &s;peaker,
who had ever appeared in ROME. Tho&s;e of fine tafte,
<PB N="167" REF="165">
however, pronounced this judgment of the ROMAN
orator, as well as of the GRECIAN, that both of them
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed in eloquence all that had ever appeared,
but that they were far from reaching the prefection of
their art, which was infinite, and not only exceeded
human force to attain, but human imagination to
conceive. CICERO declares him&s;elf di&s;&s;atisfied with
his own performances; nay, even with tho&s;e of DE|MOSTHENIES.
<HI>Ita &s;unt avidae capaces me&s;e aures,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>&s;emper aliquid immen&s;um, infinitumque de|&s;iderant.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;ingle circum&s;tance is &s;ulfficient to make us
apprehend the wide difference between ancient and
modern eloquence, and let us &s;ee how much the lat|ter
is inferior to the former. Of all the polite and
and learned nations, BRITAIN alone po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a po|pular
government, or admits into the legi&s;lature &s;uch
numerous a&s;&s;emblies as can be &s;uppo&s;ed to lie under
the dominion of eloquence. But what has BRITAIN
to boa&s;t of in this particular? In enumerating all
the great men, who have done honour to our country,
we exult in our poets and philo&s;ophers; but what
orators are ever mentioned? Or where are the mo|numents
of their genius to be met with? There are
found indeed, in our hi&s;tories, the names of &s;everal,
who directed the re&s;olutions of our parliament: But
neither them&s;elves nor others have taken the pains to
pre&s;erve their &s;peeches; and the authority which they
<PB N="168" REF="166">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;eems to have been owing to their experi|ence,
wi&s;dom, or power, more than to their talents
for oratory. At pre&s;ent, there are above half a dozen
&s;peakers in the two hou&s;es, who, in the judgment of
the public, have reached very near the &s;ame pitch of
eloquence; and no man pretends to give any one the
preference to the re&s;t. This &s;eems to me a certain
proof, that none of them have attained much beyond
a mediocrity in their art, and that the &s;pecies of elo|quence,
which they a&s;pire to, gives no exerci&s;e to the
&s;ublimer faculties of the mind, but may be reached
by ordinary talents and flight application. A hun|dred
cabinet-makers in LONDON can work a table or
a chair equally well; but no one poet can write ver&s;es
with &s;uch &s;pirit and elegance as Mr. POPE.</P>
<P>WE are told, that when DEMOSTHENES was to
plead, all ingenious men flocked to ATHENS from
the mo&s;t remote parts of GREECE, as to the mo&s;t
celebrated &s;pectacle of the world<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Ne illud quidem intelligunt, non modo ita memoriae pro|ditum e&s;&s;e, &s;ed ita nece&s;&s;e fui&s;&s;e, cum DEMOSTHENES dicturus e&s;&s;et, ut concur&s;ds, audiendi cau&s;a, ex tota GRICIA fierent.

When old CIBBER is to act, the curio&s;ity of &s;everal

<P>EVEN a per&s;on unacquainted with the noble remains
of ancient orators, may judge, from a few &s;trokes,
that the &s;tile or &s;pecies of their eloquence was infi|nitely
more &s;ublime than that which modern orators
a&s;pire to. How ab&s;urd would it appear, in our tem|perate

like that noble one of DEMOSTHENES, &s;o much
celebrated by QUINCTILIAN and LONGINUS, when,
ju&s;tifying the un&s;ucce&s;sful battle of CHAERONEA, he
breaks out, <HI>No, my Fellow-Citizens, No: You have

<P>ONE is &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s what cau&s;e we may
a&s;cribe &s;o &s;en&s;ible a decline of eloquence in latter
ages. The genius of mankind, at all times, is, per|haps,
equal: The moderns have applied them&s;elves,
with great indu&s;try and &s;ucce&s;s, to all the other arts
and &s;ciences: And one of the mo&s;t learned nations
of the univer&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a popular government; a cir|cum&s;tance
which &s;eems requi&s;ite for the full di&s;play of
the&s;e noble talents: But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e ad|vantages,
our progre&s;s in eloquence is very incon&s;i|derable,
in compari&s;on of the advances, which we
have made in all the other parts of learning.</P>
<P>SHALL we a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;trains of ancient elo|quence
are un&s;uitable to our age, and not to be imi|tated
by modern orators? Whatever rea&s;ons may be
made u&s;e of to prove this, I am per&s;uaded they will
be found, upon examination, to be un&s;ound and un|&s;atisfactory.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> IT may be &s;aid, that in ancient times, du|ring
the flouri&s;hing period of the GREEK and ROMAN
learning, the municipal laws, in every &s;tate were
but few and &s;imple, and the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es
<PB N="172" REF="170">
was, in a great mea&s;ure, left to the equity and com|mon
&s;en&s;e of the judges. The &s;tudy of the laws was
not then a laborious occupation, requiring the drudg|ery
of a whole life to fini&s;h it, and utterly incom|patible
with every other &s;tudy or profe&s;&s;ion. The
great &s;tate&s;ment and generals among the ROMANS were
all lawyers; and CICERO, to &s;hew the facility of ac|quiring
this &s;cience declares, that in the mid&s;t of all
his occupations, he would undertake, in a few days,
to make him&s;elf a compleat civilian. Now, where
a pleader addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the equity of his judges,
he has much more room to di&s;play his eloquence,
than where he mu&s;t draw his arguments from &s;trict
laws, &s;tatutes, and precedents. In the former ca&s;e,
many circum&s;tances mu&s;t be taken in, many per&s;onal
con&s;iderations regarded; and even favour and inclina|tion,
which it belongs to the orator, by his art and
eloquence, to conciliate, may be di&s;gui&s;ed under the
appearance of equity. But how &s;hall a modern law|yer
have lei&s;ure to quit his toil&s;ome occupations, in
order to gather the flowers of PARNASSUS? Or
what opportunity &s;hall he have of di&s;playing them,
amid&s;t the rigid and &s;ubtile arguments, objections, and
replies, which he is obliged to make u&s;e of? The
greate&s;t genius, and greate&s;t orator, who &s;hould pre|tend
to plead before the <HI>Chancellor,</HI> after a month's
&s;tudy of the laws, would only labour to make him|&s;elf
ridiculous.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="171">
I AM ready to own, that this circum&s;tance, of the
multiplicity and intricacy of laws, is a di&s;couragement
to eloquence in modern times: But I a&s;&s;ert, that it
will not account entirely for the decline of that noble
art. It may bani&s;h oratory from WESTMINSTER-HALL,
but not from either hou&s;e of parliament.
Among the ATHENIANS, the AREOPAGITES expre&s;ly
forbad all allurements of eloquence; and &s;ome have
pretended that in the GREEK orations wrote in the
<HI>judiciary</HI> form, there is not &s;uch a bold and rhetorical
&s;tile, as appears in the ROMAN. But to what a pitch
did the ATHENIANS carry their eloquence in the <HI>de|liberative</HI>
kind, when affairs of &s;tate were canva&s;&s;ed,
and the liberty, happine&s;s, and honour of the nation
were the &s;ubject of debate? Di&s;putes of this na|ture
elevate the genius above all others, and give the
fulle&s;t &s;cope to eloquence; and &s;uch di&s;putes are very
frequent in this nation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT may be pretended, that the decline of
eloquence is owing to the &s;uperior good &s;en&s;e of the
moderns, who reject with di&s;dain, all tho&s;e rhetorical
tricks, employed to &s;educe the judges, and will admit
of nothing but &s;olid argument in any debate or deli|beration.
If a man be accu&s;ed of murder, the fact
mu&s;t be proved by witne&s;&s;es add evidence; and the
laws will afterwards determine the puni&s;hment of the
criminal. It would be ridiculous to de&s;cribe, in &s;trong
colours, the horror and cruelty of the action: To in|troduce
<PB N="174" REF="172">
the relations of the dead; and, at a &s;ignal,
make them throw them&s;elves at the feet of the judges,
imploring ju&s;tice with tears and lamentations: And
&s;till more ridiculous would it be, to employ a picture
repre&s;enting the bloody deed, in order to move the
judges by the di&s;play of &s;o tragical a &s;pectacle: Tho'
we know, that this poor artifice was &s;ometimes prac|ti&s;ed
by the pleaders of old<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">QUINTIL. lib. 6. cap. 1.</NOTE>. Now, bani&s;h the pa|thetic
from public di&s;cour&s;es, and you reduce the
&s;peakers merely to modern eloquence; that is, to
good-&s;en&s;e, delivered in proper expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it may be acknowledged, that our mo|dern
cu&s;toms, or our &s;uperior good-&s;en&s;e, if you will,
&s;hould make our orators more cautious and re&s;erved
than the ancient, in attempting to inflame the pa&s;|&s;ions,
or elevate the imagination of their audience:
But, I &s;ee no rea&s;on, why it &s;hould make them de|&s;pari
ab&s;olutely of &s;ucceeding in that attempt. It
&s;hould make them redouble their art, not abandon it
intirely. The ancient orators &s;eems al&s;o to have been
on their guard again&s;t this jealou&s;y of their audience;
but they took a different way of eluding it<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">LONGINUS, cap. 15.</NOTE>. They
hurried away with &s;uch a torrent of &s;ublime and pa|thetic,
that they left their hearers no lei&s;ure to per|ceive
the artifice, by which they were deceived. Nay,
<PB N="175" REF="173">
to con&s;ider the matter aright, they were not deceived
by any artifice. The orator, by the force of his own
genius and eloquence, fir&s;t inflamed him&s;elf with an|ger,
indignation, pity, &s;orrow; and then communi|cated
tho&s;e impetuous movements to his audience.</P>
<P>DOES any man pretend to have more good &s;en&s;e than
JULIUS CAESAR? Yet that haughty conqueror, we
know, was &s;o &s;ubdued by the charms of CICERO's
eloquence, that he was, in a manner, con&s;trained to
change his &s;ettled purpo&s;e and re&s;olution, and to ab|&s;olve
a criminal, whom, before that orator pleaded,
he was determined to condemn.</P>
<P>SOME objections, I own, notwith&s;tanding his va&s;t
&s;ucce&s;s, may lie again&s;t &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of the ROMAN
orator. He is too florid and rhetorical: His figures
are too &s;triking and palpable: His divi&s;ions drawn
chiefly from the rules of the &s;chool: And his wit di&s;|dains
not always the artifice even of a pun, rhyme, or
jingle of words. The GRECIAN addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf
to an audience much le&s;s refined than the ROMAN &s;e|nate
or judges. The lowe&s;t vulgar of ATHENS were
his &s;overeigns, and the arbiters of his eloquence<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The orators formed the ta&s;te of the ATHENIAN people, not the people of the orators. GORGIAS LEONTINUS was very taking with them, till they became a cquainted with a better man|ner. His figures of &s;peech, &s;ays DIODORUS SICULUS, his anti|thefis, his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, his <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which are now de&s;pi&s;ed, had a great effect upon the audience. Lib. 12. page 106. <HI>ex edi|tione</HI> RHOD: 'Tis in vain therefore for modern orators to plead the ta&s;te of their hearers as an apology for their lame performances. It would be &s;trange prejudice in favour of antiquity, not to allow a BRITISH parliament to be naturally &s;uperior in judgment and delicacy to an ATHENIAN mob.</NOTE>
<PB N="176" REF="174">
Yet is his manner much more cha&s;te and au&s;tere than
that of the other. Could it be copied, its &s;ucce&s;s
would be infallible over a modern a&s;&s;embly. 'Tis ra|pid
harmony, exactly adju&s;ted to the &s;en&s;e: 'Tis ve|hement
rea&s;oning, without any appearance of art:
'Tis di&s;dain, anger, boldne&s;s, freedom, involved in
a continued &s;tream of argument: And of all human
productions, the orations of DEMOSTHENES pre&s;ent
to us the models, which approach the neare&s;t to per|fection.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> IT may be pretended, that the di&s;orders
of the ancient governments, and the enormous crimes,
of which the citizens were often guilty, afforded much
ampler matter for eloquence than can be met with
among the moderns. Were there no VERRES or CA|TALINE,
there would be no CICERO. But that this
rea&s;on can have no great influence, is evident. 'Twould
be ea&s;y to find a PHILIP in modern times; but where
&s;hall we find a DEMOSTHENES?</P>
<P>WHAT remains, then, but that we lay the blame
on the want of genius, or of judgment in our &s;peak|ers,
<PB N="177" REF="175">
who either found them&s;elves incapable of reaching
the heights of ancient eloquence, or rejected all &s;uch
endeavours, as un&s;uitable to the &s;pirit of modern a&s;|&s;emblies?
A few &s;ucce&s;sful attempts of this nature might
rouze up the genius of the nation, excite the emulation
of the youth, and accu&s;tom our ears to a more &s;ublime
and more pathetic elocution, than what we have been
hitherto entertained with. There is certainly &s;ome|thing
accidental in the fir&s;t ri&s;e and the progre&s;s of
the arts in any nation. I doubt whether a very &s;ati&s;|factory
rea&s;on can be given, why ancient ROME, tho'
it received all its arts from GREECE, could attain only
to a ta&s;te or reli&s;h of &s;tatuary, painting and architec|ture,
without reaching the practice of the&s;e noble
arts: While modern ROME has been excited, by a few
remains found among the ruins of antiquity, and has
carried the&s;e arts to the greate&s;t perfection. Had &s;uch
a cultivated genius for oratory, as WALLER's for
poetry, ari&s;en, during the civil wars, when liberty be|gan
to be fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, and popular a&s;&s;emblies to
enter into all the mo&s;t material points of govern|ment;
I am per&s;uaded &s;o illu&s;trious an example would
have given a quite different turn to BRITISH elo|quence,
and made us reach the perfection of the an|cient
model. Our orators would then have done ho|nour
to their country, as well as our poets and phi|lo&s;ophers,
and BRITISH CICEROS have appeared as
well as BRITISH PLUTARCHS and VIRGILS.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="176">
I HAVE confe&s;t that there is &s;omething accidental in
the origin and progre&s;s of the arts in any nation; and
yet I cannot forbear thinking, that if the other learned
and polite nations of EUROPE had po&s;&s;e&s;t the &s;ame ad|vantages
of a popular government, they would pro|bably
have carried eloquence to a greater height than
it has yet reached in BRITAIN. The FRENCH &s;er|mons,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of FLECHIER and BOSSUET,
are much &s;uperior to the ENGLISH in this parti|cular;
and in both of them are many &s;trokes of the
mo&s;t &s;ublime poetry. None but private cau&s;es, in
that country, are ever debated before their parliament
or courts of judicature; but notwith&s;tanding this di&s;|advantage,
there appears a &s;pirit of eloquence in ma|ny
of their lawyers, which, with proper cultivation
and encouragement, might ri&s;e to the greate&s;t height.
The pleadings of PATRU are very elegant, and give
us room to imagine what &s;o fine a genius could have
performed in que&s;tions concerning public liberty or
&s;lavery, peace or war, who exerts him&s;elf with &s;uch
&s;ucce&s;s, in debates concerning the price of an old hor&s;e,
or a go&s;&s;iping &s;tory of a quarrel betwixt an abbe&s;s and
her nuns. For 'tis remarkable, that this polite writer,
tho' e&s;teemed by all the men of wit in his time, was
never employed in the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cau&s;es of their
courts of judicature, but lived and died in poverty:
From an ancient prejudice indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated by

again&s;t cardinal MAZARINE, made the parlia|ment
of PARIS enter into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of public af|fairs,
and during that &s;hort interval, there appeared
many &s;ymptoms of the revival of ancient eloquence.
The <HI>avocat general</HI> TALON, in an oration, invoked
on his knees, the &s;pirit of St. LOUIS to look down
with compa&s;&s;ion on his divided and unhappy people,
and to in&s;pire them, from above, with the love of con|cord
and unanimity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De RETZ's Memoirs.</NOTE>. The members of the FRENCH
academy have attempted to give us models of elo|quence
in their harangues at their admittance: But,
having no &s;ubject to di&s;cour&s;e upon, they have run al|together
into a ful&s;ome &s;train of panegyric and flat|tery,
the mo&s;t barren of all &s;ubjects. Their &s;tile,
however, is commonly, on the&s;e occa&s;ions, very ele|vated
and &s;ublime, and might reach the greate&s;t
heights, were it employed on a &s;ubject more favour|able
and engaging.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome circum&s;tances, I confe&s;s, in the
ENGLISH temper and genius, which are di&s;advanta|geous
to the progre&s;s of eloquence, and render all
attempts of that kind more dangerous and difficult
among them than among any other nation. The
ENGLISH are con&s;picuous for <HI>good-&s;en&s;e,</HI> which makes
them very jealous of any attempts to deceive them
by the flowers of rhetoric and elocution. They are
<PB N="180" REF="178">
al&s;o peculiarly <HI>mode&s;t;</HI> which makes them con&s;ider it
as a piece of arrogance to offer any thing but rea&s;on
to public a&s;&s;emblies, or attempt to guide them by
pa&s;&s;ion or fancy. I may, perhaps, be allowed to add,
that the people in general are not remarkable for de|licacy
of ta&s;te, or for &s;en&s;ibility to the charms of the
mu&s;es. Their <HI>mu&s;ical parts,</HI> to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of
a noble author, are but indifferent. Hence their co|mic
poets, to move them, mu&s;t have recour&s;e to ob|&s;cenity;
their tragic poets to blood and &s;laughter:
And hence their orators, being deprived of any &s;uch
re&s;ource, have abandoned altogether the hopes of
moving them, and have confined them&s;elves to plain
argument and rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>THESE circum&s;tances, joined to particular acci|dents,
may, perhaps, have retarded the growth of
eloquence in this kingdom; but will not be able to
prevent its &s;ucce&s;s, if ever it appear among&s;t us:
And one may &s;afely pronounce, that this is a field, in
which the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing laurels may yet be gathered,
if any youth of accompli&s;hed genius, thoroughly ac|quainted
with all the polite arts, and not ignorant of
public bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould appear in parliament, and ac|cu&s;tom
our ears to an eloquence more commanding
and pathetic. And to confirm me in this opinion,
there occur two con&s;iderations, the one derived from
ancient, the other from modern times.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="179">
'TIS &s;eldom or never found, when a fal&s;e ta&s;te in
poetry or eloquence prevails among any people, that
it has been preferred to a true, upon compari&s;on and
reflection. It commonly prevails merely from igno|rance
of the true, and from the want of perfect mo|dels,
to lead men into a ju&s;ter apprehen&s;ion, and more
refined reli&s;h of tho&s;e productions of genius. When
<HI>the&s;e</HI> appear, they &s;oon unite all &s;uffrages in their fa|vour,
and, by their natural and powerful charms, gain
over, even the mo&s;t prejudiced, to the love and admi|ration
of them. The principles of every pa&s;&s;ion, and
of every &s;entiment, is in every man; and when
touched properly, they ri&s;e to life, and warm the
heart, and convey that &s;atisfaction by which a work
of genius is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the adulterate beauties
of a capricious wit and fancy. And if this ob&s;erva|tion
be true, with regard to all the liberal arts, it
mu&s;t be peculiarly &s;o, with regard to eloquence;
which, being merely calculated for the public, and
for men of the world, cannot, with any pretext of
rea&s;on, appeal from the people to more refined judges;
but mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the public verdict, without re|&s;erve
or limitation. Whoever, upon compari&s;on, is
deemed by a common audience the greate&s;t orator,
ought mo&s;t certainly to be pronounced &s;uch, by men
of &s;cience and erudition. And tho' an indifferent
orator may triumph for a long time, and be e&s;teemed
altogether perfect by the vulgar, who are &s;atisfied
with his accompli&s;hments, and know not in what he
<PB N="182" REF="180">
is defective: Yet, whenever the true genius ari&s;es, <HI>he</HI>
draws to him the attention of every one, and imme|diately
appears &s;uperior to his rival.</P>
<P>NOW to judge by this rule, ancient eloquence, that
is, the &s;ublime and pa&s;&s;ionate, is of a much ju&s;ter
ta&s;te than the modern, or the argumentative and ra|tional;
and, if properly executed, will always have
more command and authority over mankind. We are
&s;atisfied with our mediocrity, becau&s;e we have had no
experience of any thing better: But the ancients had
experience of both, and, upon compari&s;on, gave the
preference to that kind, of which they have left us
&s;uch applauded models. For, if I am not mi&s;taken,
our modern eloquence is of the &s;ame &s;tile or &s;pecies
with that which ancient criticks denominated ATTIC
eloquence, that is, calm, elegant and &s;ubtile, which
in&s;tructed the rea&s;on more than affected the pa&s;&s;ions,
and never rai&s;ed its tone above argument or common
di&s;cour&s;e. Such was the eloquence of LYSIAS among
the ATHENIANS, and of CALVUS among the RO|MANS.
The&s;e were e&s;teemed in their time; but when
compared with DEMOSTHENES and CICERO, were
eclip&s;ed like a taper when &s;et in the rays of a meri|dian
&s;un. Tho&s;e latter orators po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ame ele|gance
and &s;ubtilty, and force of argument, with the
former; but what rendered them chiefly admirable,
was that pathetic and &s;ublime, which, on proper oc|ca&s;ions,
<PB N="183" REF="181">
they threw into their di&s;cour&s;e, and by which
they commanded the re&s;olutions of their audience.</P>
<P>OF this &s;pecies of eloquence we have &s;carce had any
in&s;tances in BRITAIN, at lea&s;t in our public &s;peakers.
In our writers, we have had &s;ome in&s;tances, which
have met with great applau&s;e, and might a&s;&s;ure our
ambitious youth of equal or &s;uperior glory in attempts
for the revival of ancient eloquence. Lord BOLING|BROKE's
productions, with all their defects in argu|ment,
method, and preci&s;ion, contain a force and
energy, which our orators &s;carce ever aim at; tho'
'tis evident, that &s;uch an elevated &s;tile has much bet|ter
grace in a &s;peaker than in a writer, and is a&s;&s;ured
of more prompt and more a&s;toni&s;hing &s;ucce&s;s. 'Tis
there &s;econded by the graces of voice and action:
The movements are mutually communicated betwixt
the orator and the audience: And the very a&s;pect of
a large a&s;&s;embly, attentive to the di&s;cour&s;e of one
man, mu&s;t in&s;pire him with a peculiar elevation, &s;uf|ficient
to give a propriety to the &s;tronge&s;t figures and
expre&s;&s;ions. 'Tis true, there is a great prejudice
again&s;t <HI>&s;et-&s;$eeches;</HI> and a man can &s;carce e&s;cape ridi|cule,
who repeats a di&s;cour&s;e as a &s;chool-boy his le&s;|&s;on,
and takes no notice of any thing which has been
advanced in the cour&s;e of the debate. But where is
the nece&s;&s;ity of falling into this ab&s;urdity? A public
&s;peaker mu&s;t know beforehand the que&s;tion under de|bate.
<PB N="184" REF="182">
He may compo&s;e all the arguments, objections,
and an&s;wers, &s;uch as he thinks will be mo&s;t proper

<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that
even tho' our modern orators &s;hould not elevate their
&s;tile or a&s;pire to a rival&s;hip with the antient; yet
there is a material defect in mo&s;t of their &s;peeches,
which they might correct, without departing from
that compo&s;ed air of argument and rea&s;oning, to
which they limit their ambition. Their great affecta|tion
of extemporary di&s;cour&s;es has made them reject
all order and method, which &s;eems &s;o requi&s;ite to ar|gument,
and without which 'tis &s;carce po&s;&s;ible to pro|duce

But when the event is &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed

THE di&s;tingui&s;hing between chance and cau&s;es
mu&s;t depend upon every particular man's &s;agacity, in
con&s;idering every particular incident. But, if I were
to a&s;&s;ign any general rule to help us in applying this
di&s;tinction, it would be the following, <HI>What depends
upon a few per&s;ons is, in a great mea&s;ure, to be a&s;cribed
to chance, or &s;ecret and unknown cau&s;es: What ari&s;es
from a great number, may often be accounted for by de|terminate
and known cau&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>THERE may two very natural rea&s;ons be a&s;|&s;igned
for this rule. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> If you &s;uppo&s;e a dye to
have any bya&s;s, however &s;mall, to a particular &s;ide,
this bya&s;s, tho' perhaps, it may not appear in a few
throws, will certainly prevail in a great number, and
will ca&s;t the balance entirely to that &s;ide. In like
manner, when any <HI>cau&s;es</HI> beget a particular inclina|tion
or pa&s;&s;ion, at a certain time, and among a cer|tain
people; tho' many individuals may e&s;cape the'
contagion, and be ruled by pa&s;&s;ions peculiar to them|&s;elves;
yet the multitude will certainly be infected
with the common pa&s;&s;ion, and be governed by it in all
their actions.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THOSE principles or cau&s;es, which are
fitted to operate on a multitude, are always of a
gro&s;&s;er and more &s;tubborn nature, le&s;s &s;ubject to acci|dents,
and le&s;s influenced by whim and private fancy,
than tho&s;e which operate on a few only. The latter
<PB N="189" REF="186">
are commonly &s;o delicate and refined, that the &s;mall|e&s;t
incident in the health, education, or fortune of a
particular per&s;on, is &s;ufficient to divert their cour&s;e,
and retard their operation; nor is it po&s;&s;ible to re|duce
them to any general maxims or ob&s;ervations.
Their influence at one time will never a&s;&s;ure us con|cerning
their influence at another; even tho' all the
general circum&s;tances &s;hould be the &s;ame in both
ca&s;es.</P>
<P>TO Judge by this rule, the dome&s;tic and the gra|dual
revolutions of a &s;tate, mu&s;t be a more proper &s;ub|ject
of rea&s;oning and ob&s;ervation, than the foreign
and the violent, which are commonly produced by
&s;ingle per&s;ons, and are more influenced by whim, folly
or caprice, than by general pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts.
The depre&s;&s;ion of the lords, and ri&s;e of the commons
in ENGLAND, after the &s;tatutes of alienation, and the
increa&s;e of trade and indu&s;try, are more ea&s;ily ac|counted
for by general principles, than the depre&s;|&s;ion
of the SPANISH, and ri&s;e of the FRENCH mo|narchy,
after the death of CHARLES QUINT. Had
HARRY IV. Cardinal RICHELIEU, and LOUIS XIV.
been SPANIARDS; and PHILIP II, III, and IV, and
CHARLES II. been FRENCHMEN, the hi&s;tory of the&s;e
two nations had been intirely rever&s;ed.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;ame rea&s;on, 'tis more ea&s;y to account for
the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of commerce in any kingdom,
<PB N="190" REF="187">
than for that of learning; and a &s;tate, which &s;hould
apply it&s;elf to the encouragement of the one, would
be much more a&s;&s;ured of &s;ucce&s;s, than one which
&s;hould cultivate the other. Avarice, or the de&s;ire of
gain, is an univer&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, which operates at all
times, in all places, and upon all per&s;ons: But curi|o&s;ity,
or the love of knowledge, has a very limited
influence, and requires youth, lei&s;ure, education, ge|nius,
and example, to make it govern any per&s;on.
You will never want book&s;ellers, while there are buy|ers
of books: But there may frequently be readers,
where there are are no authors. Multitudes of peo|ple,
nece&s;&s;ity and liberty, have begot commerce in
HOLLAND: But &s;tudy and application have &s;carce
produced any eminent writers.</P>
<P>WE may, therefore, conclude, that there is no &s;ub|ject,
in which we mu&s;t proceed with more caution,
than in tracing the hi&s;tory of the arts and &s;ciences;
le&s;t we a&s;&s;ign cau&s;es which never exi&s;ted, and reduce
what is merely contingent to &s;table and univer&s;al
principles. Tho&s;e, who cultivate the &s;ciences in any
&s;tate, are always few in number: The pa&s;&s;ion, which
governs them, limited: Their ta&s;te and judgment

influence on the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of all the refined
arts.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="188">
BUT there is a rea&s;on, which induces me not to
a&s;cribe the matter altogether to chance. Tho' the
per&s;ons, who cultivate the &s;ciences with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;h|ing
&s;ucce&s;s, as to attract the admiration of po&s;terity,
be always few, in all nations and all ages; 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible
but a &s;hare of the &s;ame &s;pirit and genius mu&s;t
be antecedently diffu&s;ed thro' the people among whom
they ari&s;e, in order to produce, form, and cultivate,
from their earlie&s;t infancy, the ta&s;te and judgment of
tho&s;e eminent writers. The ma&s;s cannot be altoge|ther
in&s;ipid, from which &s;uch refined &s;pirits are ex|tracted<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E&s;t Deus in nobis; agitante cale&s;cimus illo: Impetus hic, &s;acrae &s;emina mentis habet, OVID. <HI>Fa&s;t. Lib.</HI> 1.</NOTE>.
<HI>There is a God within us,</HI> &s;ays OVID, <HI>who
breathes that divine air by which we are animated.</HI>
Poets, in all ages, have advanced this claim to in&s;pi|ration.
There is not however any thing &s;upernatural
in the ca&s;e. Their fire is not kindled from heaven.
It only runs along the earth; is caught from one
brea&s;t to another; and burns brighte&s;t, where the
materials are be&s;t prepared, and mo&s;t happily di&s;po|&s;ed.
The que&s;tion, therefore, concerning the ri&s;e
and progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ciences, is not altoge|ther
a que&s;tion concerning the ta&s;te, genius, and &s;pirit
of a few, but concerning tho&s;e of a whole people;
and may, therefore, be accounted for, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
by general cau&s;es and principles. I grant, that
a man, who &s;hould inquire, why &s;uch a particular
<PB N="192" REF="189">
poet, as HOMER, for in&s;tance, exi&s;ted, at &s;uch a
place, in &s;uch a time, would throw him&s;elf headlong
into chimaera, and could never treat of &s;uch a &s;ubject,
without a multitude of fal&s;e &s;ubtilties and refinements.
He might as well pretend to give a rea&s;on, why &s;uch
particular generals, as FABIUS and SCIPIO, lived in
ROME at &s;uch a time, and why FABIUS came into
the world before SCIPIO. For &s;uch incidents as
tho&s;e, no other rea&s;on can be given but that of HO|RACE.</P>

<P>BUT I am per&s;uaded, that in many ca&s;es very good
rea&s;ons might be given, why &s;uch a nation is more
polite and learned, at a particular time, than any of
its neighbours. At lea&s;t, this is is &s;o curious a &s;ub|ject,
that it were a pity to abandon it intirely, before
we have found, whether or not it be &s;u&s;cepible of
rea&s;oning, and can be reduced to any general prin|ciples.
I &s;hall therefore proceed to deliver a few ob|&s;ervations
on this &s;ubject, which I &s;ubmit, with intire
deference, to the cen&s;ure and examination of the
learned.</P>
<P><HI>MY fir&s;t ob&s;ervation is,</HI> That it is impo&s;&s;ible for the
arts and &s;ciences to ari&s;e, at fir&s;t, among any people, un|le&s;s
<PB N="193" REF="190">
that people enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of a free govern|ment.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t ages of the world, when men are as
yet barbarous and ignorant, they &s;eek no farther &s;e|curity
again&s;t mutual violence and inju&s;tice, than the
choice of &s;ome rulers, few or many, in whom they
place an implicite confidence, without providing any
&s;ecurity, by laws or political in&s;titutions, again&s;t the
violence and inju&s;tice of the&s;e rulers. If the autho|rity
be centred in a &s;ingle per&s;on, and if the people,
either by conque&s;t, or by the ordinary cour&s;e of pro|pagation,
increa&s;e to a great multitude, the monarch,
finding it impo&s;&s;ible, in his own per&s;on, to execute
every office of &s;overeignty, in every place, mu&s;t dele|gate
his authority to inferior magi&s;trates, who pre&s;erve
peace and order in their particular di&s;tricts. As expe|rience
and education have not yet refined the judge|ments
of men to any con&s;iderable degree, the prince,
who is him&s;elf unre&s;trained, never dreams of re&s;train|ing
his mini&s;ters, but delegates his full authority to
every one, whom he &s;ets over any portion of the peo|ple.
All general laws are attended with inconve|niencies,
when applied to particular ca&s;es; and it re|quires
great penetration and experience, both to per|ceive
that the&s;e inconveniencies are fewer than what
re&s;ult from full di&s;cretionary powers in every magi&s;|trate;
and al&s;o, to di&s;cern what general laws are, upon
the whole, attended with fewe&s;t inconveniencies.
<PB N="194" REF="191">
This is a matter of &s;o great difficulty, that men may
have made &s;ome advances, even in the &s;ublime arts of
poetry and eloquence, where a rapidity of genius and
imagination a&s;&s;i&s;ts their progre&s;s, before they have ar|rived
at any great refinement in their municipal laws,
where frequent trials, and diligent ob&s;ervation, can
alone direct their improvements. It is not, there|fore,
to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a barbarous monarch, un|re&s;trained
and unin&s;tructed, will ever become a legi&s;|lator,
or think of re&s;training his <HI>Ba&s;haws</HI> in every
province, or even his <HI>Cadis</HI> in every village. We
are told, that the late <HI>Czar,</HI> tho' actuated with a no|ble
genius, and &s;mit with the love and admiration of
EUROPEAN arts; yet profe&s;&s;ed an e&s;teem for the
TURKISH policy in this particular, and approved of
&s;uch &s;ummary deci&s;ions of cau&s;es, as are practi&s;ed in
that barbarous monarchy, where the judges are not
re&s;trained by any methods, forms, or laws. He did
not perceive, how contrary &s;uch a practice would have
been to all his other endeavours for refining his peo|ple.
Arbitrary power, in all ca&s;es, is &s;omewhat op|pre&s;&s;ive
and deba&s;ing; but 'tis altogether ruinous and
intolerable, when contracted into a &s;mall compa&s;s;
and becomes &s;till wor&s;e, when the per&s;on, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
it, knows that the time of his authority is limit|ed
and uncertain. <HI>Habet &s;ubjectos tanquam &s;uos; viles,
ut alienos</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TACIT. Hi&s;t. lib. 1.</NOTE>. He governs the &s;ubjects with full autho|rity,
<PB N="195" REF="192">
as if they were his own; and with negligence
or tyranny, as belonging to another. A people go|verned
after &s;uch a manner are &s;laves in the full and
proper &s;en&s;e of the word; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible they can
ever a&s;pire to any refinements of ta&s;te or rea&s;on. They
dare not &s;o much as pretend to enjoy the nece&s;&s;aries
of life in plenty or &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>TO expect, therefore, that the arts and &s;ciences
&s;hould take their fir&s;t ri&s;e in a monarchy, is to expect
a contradiction. Before the&s;e refinements have taken
place, the monarch is ignorant and unin&s;tructed; and,
not having knowledge &s;ufficient to make him &s;en&s;ible
of the nece&s;&s;ity of balancing his government upon
general laws, he delegates his full powers to all infe|rior
magi&s;trates. This barbarous policy deba&s;es the
people, and for ever prevents all improvement. Were
it po&s;&s;ible, that, before &s;cience was known in the
world, a monarch could po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;o much wi&s;dom as to
become a legi&s;lator, and govern his people by law,
not by the arbitrary will of their fellow &s;ubjects, it
might be po&s;&s;ible for that &s;pecies of government to be
the fir&s;t nur&s;ery of arts and &s;ciences. But in that &s;up|po&s;ition
there &s;eems to be a manife&s;t contradiction.</P>
<P>IT may happen, that a republic, in its infant &s;tate,
may be &s;upported by as few laws as a barbarous mo|narchy,
and may entru&s;t as unlimited an authority to
its magi&s;trates or judges. But, be&s;ides that the fre|quent
<PB N="196" REF="193">
elections of the&s;e magi&s;trates by the people, are
a con&s;iderable check upon their authority; 'tis im|po&s;&s;ible,
but, in time, the nece&s;&s;ity of re&s;training the
magi&s;trates, in order to pre&s;erve liberty, mu&s;t at la&s;t
appear, and give ri&s;e to general laws and &s;tatutes.
The ROMAN Con&s;uls, for &s;ome time, decided all cau|&s;es,
without being confined by any po&s;itive &s;tatutes,
till the people, bearing this yoke with impatience,
created the <HI>decemvirs,</HI> who promulgated the <HI>twelve
tables;</HI> a body of laws, which, tho', perhaps, they
were not equal in bulk to one ENGLISH act of parlia|ment,
were almo&s;t the only written rules which regu|lated
property and puni&s;hment, for &s;ome ages, in that
famous republic. They were, however, &s;ufficient,
together with the forms of a free government, to &s;e|cure
the lives and properties of the citizens; to ex|empt
one man from the dominion of another; and
to protect every one again&s;t the violence or tyranny of
his fellow citizens. In &s;uch a &s;ituation the &s;ciences
may rai&s;e their heads, and flouri&s;h: But never can
have being amid&s;t &s;uch a &s;cene of oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;la|very,
as always re&s;ults from barbarous monarchies,
where the people alone are re&s;trained by the authority
of the magi&s;trates, and the magi&s;trates are not re&s;train|ed
by any law or &s;tatute. An unlimited de&s;poti&s;m of
this nature, while i$ exi&s;ts, effectually puts a &s;top to
all improvements, and keeps men from attaining that
knowledge, which is requi&s;ite to in&s;truct them in the
<PB N="197" REF="194">
advanttages ari&s;ing from a better police, and more
moderate authority.</P>
<P>HERE then are the advantages of republics. Tho'
a republic &s;hould be barbarous, it nece&s;&s;arily, by an
infallible operation, gives ri&s;e to LAW, even before
mankind have made any con&s;iderable advances in the
other &s;ciences. From law ari&s;es &s;ecurity: From &s;e|curity
curio&s;ity: And from curio&s;ity knowledge. The
latter &s;teps of this progre&s;s may be more accidental;
but the former are altogether nece&s;&s;ary. A republic,
without laws, can never have any duration. On the
contrary, in a monarchical government, law ari&s;es
not nece&s;&s;arily from the forms of the government.
Monarchy, when ab&s;olute, contains even &s;omething
repugnant to law. Great wi&s;dom and reflexion can
alone reconcile them. But &s;uch a degree of wi&s;dom
can never be expected, before the greater refinements
and improvements of human rea&s;on. The&s;e refine|ments
require curio&s;ity, &s;ecurity, and law. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI>
growth, therefore, of the arts and &s;ciences can never
be expected in de&s;potic governments.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s of things,
law mu&s;t precede &s;cience. In republics law may pre|cede
&s;cience, and may ari&s;e from the very nature of
the government. In monarchies it ari&s;es not from
the nature of the government, and cannot precede
&s;cience. An ab&s;olute prince, who is barbarous, ren|ders
<PB N="198" REF="195">
all his mini&s;ters and magi&s;trates as ab&s;olute as
him&s;elf: And there needs no more to prevent, for
ever, all indu&s;try, curio&s;ity, and &s;cience.</P>
<P>THERE are other cau&s;es which di&s;courage the ri&s;e
of the refined arts in de&s;potic governments; tho' I
take the want of laws, and the delegation of full
powers to every petty magi&s;trate, to be the principal.
Eloquence certainly ari&s;es more naturally in popular
governments: Emulation too, in every accompli&s;h|ment,
mu&s;t there be more animated and enlivened:
And genius and capacity have a fuller &s;cope and ca|reer.
All the&s;e cau&s;es render free governments the
only proper <HI>nur&s;ery</HI> for the arts and &s;ciences.</P>
<P>THE next ob&s;ervation which I &s;hall make on this
head, is, <HI>That nothing is more favourable to the ri&s;e of
politene&s;s and learning, than a number of neighbouring
independent &s;tates connected together by commerce and
policy.</HI> The emulation, which naturally ari&s;es among
tho&s;e neighbouring &s;tates, is an obvious &s;ource of
improvement: But what I would chiefly in&s;i&s;t on is
the &s;top, which &s;uch limited territories give both to
<HI>power</HI> and to <HI>authority.</HI></P>
<P>EXTENDED governments, where a &s;ingle per&s;on has
great influence, become &s;oon de&s;potic; but &s;mall
ones change naturally into commonwealths. A large
government is accu&s;tomed by degrees to tyranny;
<PB N="199" REF="196">
becau&s;e each act of violence is at fir&s;t performed up|on
a part, which, being di&s;tant from the majority, is
not taken notice of, nor excites any violent ferment.
Be&s;ides, a large government, tho' the whole be di&s;|contented,
may, by a little art, be kept in obedience;
while each part, ignorant of the re&s;olutions of the
re&s;t, is afraid to begin any commotion or in&s;urrection.
Not to mention, that there is a &s;uper&s;titious reverence
for princes, which mankind naturally fall into when
they do not often &s;ee the &s;overeign, and when many
of them become not acquainted with him, &s;o as to
perceive his weakne&s;&s;es. And as large &s;tates can af|ford
a great expence, in order to &s;upport the pomp,
of maje&s;ty; this is a kind of fa&s;cination on mankind,
and naturally contributes to the en&s;laving them.</P>
<P>IN a &s;mall government, any act of oppre&s;&s;ion is
immediately known thro' the whole: The murmurs
and di&s;contents, proceeding from it, are ea&s;ily commu|nicated:
And the indignation ri&s;es the higher, that
the &s;ubjects are not apt to apprehend in &s;uch &s;tates,
that the di&s;tance is very wide between them&s;elves and
their &s;overeign. &startq;No man,&endq; &s;aid the prince DE
CONDE, &startq;is a hero to his <HI>Valet de Chambre.</HI>&endq; 'Tis
certain, that admiration and acquaintance are altoge|ther
incompatible towards any mortal creature. Sleep
and love convinced ALEXANDER that he was not a
God: But I &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch as attended him daily
could ea&s;ily, from the numberle&s;s weakne&s;&s;es to which
<PB N="200" REF="197">
he was &s;ubject, have given him many other &s;till more
convincing proofs of his humanity.</P>
<P>BUT the divi&s;ions into &s;mall &s;tates are favourable to
learning, by &s;topping the progre&s;s of <HI>authority</HI> as well
as that of <HI>power,</HI> Reputation is often as great a fa&s;|cination
upon power as &s;overeignty, and is equally
de&s;tructive to the freedom of thought and examina|tion.
But where a number of neighbouring &s;tates
have a great intercour&s;e of arts and commerce, their
mutual jealou&s;y keeps them from receiving too lightly
the law from each other, in matters of ta&s;te or of rea|&s;oning,
and makes them examine every work of art
with the greate&s;t care and accuracy. The contagion
of popular opinions &s;preads not &s;o ea&s;ily from one
place to another. It readily receives a check in &s;ome
&s;tate or other, where it concurs not with the prevail|ing
prejudices. And nothing but nature and rea&s;on,
or at lea&s;t, what bears them a &s;trong re&s;emblance, can
force its way thro' all ob&s;tacles, and unite the mo&s;t
rival nations into an e&s;teem and admiration of it.</P>
<P>GREECE was a clu&s;ter of little principalities, which
&s;oon became republics; and being united both by
their near neighbourhood, and by the ties of the
&s;ame language and intere&s;t, they entered into the clo|&s;e&s;t
intercour&s;e of commerce and of learning. There
concurred a happy climate, a &s;oil not unfertile, and a
mo&s;t harmonious and comprehen&s;ive language; &s;o that
<PB N="201" REF="198">
every circum&s;tance among that people &s;eemed to fa|vour
the ri&s;e of the arts and &s;ciences. Each city pro|duced
its &s;everal arti&s;ts and philo&s;ophers, who refu&s;ed
to yield the preference to tho&s;e of the neighbouring
republics: Their contentions and debates &s;harpened
the wits of men: A variety of objects was pre&s;ented
to the judgment, while each challenged the preference
to the re&s;t: And the &s;ciences, not being dwarfed by
the re&s;traint of authority, were enabled to make &s;uch
con&s;iderable &s;hoots, as are, even at this time, the ob|jects
of our admiration. After the ROMAN <HI>chri&s;tian</HI>
or <HI>catholic</HI> church had &s;pread it&s;elf over the civilized
world, and had engro&s;&s;ed all the learning of the
times; being really one large &s;tate within it&s;elf, and
united under one head; this variety of &s;ects imme|diately
di&s;appeared, and the PERIPATETIC philo|&s;ophy
was alone admitted into all the &s;chools, to the
utter depravation of every kind of learning. But
mankind having, at length, thrown off this yoke,
affairs are now returned nearly to the &s;ame &s;ituation
as before, and EUROPE is at pre&s;ent a copy at large,
of what GREECE was formerly a pattern in minia|ture.
We have &s;een the advantage of this &s;ituation in
&s;everal in&s;tances. What checked the progre&s;s of the
CARTESIAN philo&s;ophy, to which the FRENCH na|tion
&s;hewed &s;uch a &s;trong propen&s;ity towards the end
of the la&s;t century, but the oppo&s;ition made to it by
the other nations of EUROPE, who &s;oon di&s;covered
the weak &s;ides of that philo&s;ophy? The &s;evere&s;t &s;cru|tiny,
<PB N="202" REF="199">
which NEWTON's theory has undergone, pro|ceeded
not from his countrymen, but from foreigners;
and if it can overcome the ob&s;tacles which it meets
with at pre&s;ent in all parts of EUROPE, it will pro|bably
go down triumphant to the late&s;t po&s;terity.
The ENGLISH are become &s;en&s;ible of the &s;candalous
licentiou&s;ne&s;s of their &s;tage, from the example of the
FRENCH decency and morals. The FRENCH are con|vinced,
that their theatre has become &s;omewhat ef|feminate,
by too much love and gallantry; and begin
to approve of the more ma&s;culine ta&s;te of &s;ome
neighbouring nations.</P>
<P>IN CHINA there &s;eems to be a pretty con&s;iderable
&s;tock of politene&s;s and &s;cience, which, in the cour&s;e
of &s;o many centuries, might naturally be expected to
ripen into &s;omething more perfect and fini&s;hed, than
what has yet ari&s;en from them. But CHINA is one
va&s;t empire, &s;peaking one language, governed by one
law, and &s;ympathizing in the &s;ame manners. The
authority of any teacher, &s;uch as CONFUCIUS, was
propagated ea&s;ily from one corner of the empire to
another. None had courage to re&s;i&s;t the torrent of
popular opinion. And po&s;terity were not bold enough
to di&s;pute what had been univer&s;ally received by their
ance&s;tors. This &s;eems to be one natural rea&s;on, why
<PB N="203" REF="200">
the &s;ciences have made &s;o &s;low a progre&s;s in that
mighty empire<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">If it be a&s;ked how we can reconcile to the foregoing prin|ciples the happine&s;s, riches, and good police of the CHINESE, who have always been governed by a &s;ole monarch, and can &s;carce form an idea of a free government; I would an&s;wer, that tho' the CHINESE government be a pure monarchy, it is not, properly &s;peaking, ab&s;olute. This proceeds from a peculiarity of the &s;ituation of that country: They have no neighbours, ex|cept the TARTARS, from whom they were, in &s;ome mea&s;ure &s;ecured, at lea&s;t &s;eemed to be &s;ecured, by their famous wall, and by the great &s;uperiority of their numbers. By this means, mili|tary di&s;cipline has always been much neglected among&s;t them; and their &s;tanding forces are mere militia, of the wor&s;t kind; and unfit to &s;uppre&s;s any general in&s;urrection in countries &s;o ex|tremely populous. The &s;word, therefore, may properly be &s;aid to be always in the hands of the people, which is a &s;ufficient re&s;traint upon the monarch, and obliges him to lay his <HI>manda|rins</HI> or governors of provinces under the re&s;traint of general laws, in order to prevent tho&s;e rebellions, which we learn from hi&s;tory to have been &s;o frequent and dangerous in that government. Perhaps, a pure monarchy of this kind, were it fitted for a de|fence again&s;t foreign enemies, would be the be&s;t of all govern|ments, as having both the tranquillity attending kingly power, and the moderation and liberty of popular a&s;&s;emblies.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the face of the globe, EUROPE, of
all the four parts of the world, is the mo&s;t broken by
&s;eas, rivers, and mountains; and GREECE of all
countries of EUROPE. Hence the&s;e regions were na|turally
<PB N="204" REF="201">
turally divided into &s;everal di&s;tinct governments. And
hence the &s;ciences aro&s;e in GREECE; and EUROPE
has been hitherto the mo&s;t con&s;tant habitation of
them.</P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes been inclined to think, that in|terruptions
in the periods of learning, were they not
attended with &s;uch a de&s;truction of ancient books, and
the records of hi&s;tory, would be rather favourable to
the arts and &s;ciences, by breaking the progre&s;s of au|thority,
and dethroning the tyrannical u&s;urpers over
human rea&s;on. In this particular, they have the &s;ame
influence, as interruptions in political governments
and &s;ocieties. Con&s;ider the blind &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of the
ancient philo&s;ophers to the &s;everal ma&s;ters in each
&s;chool, and you will be convinced, that no good could
ever be expected from an hundred centuries of &s;uch a
&s;ervile philo&s;ophy. Even the ECLECTIC$, who aro&s;e
about the age of AUGUSTUS, notwith&s;tanding their
profe&s;&s;ing to chu&s;e freely what plea&s;ed them from
every different &s;ect, were yet, in the main, as &s;lavi&s;h
and dependent as any of their brethren; &s;ince they
&s;ought for truth, not in nature, but in the &s;everal
&s;chools; where they &s;uppo&s;ed &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
found, tho' not united in a body, yet di&s;per&s;ed in
parts. Upon the revival of learning, tho&s;e &s;ects of
STOICS and EPICUREANS, PLATONISTS, and PY|THAGOREANS,
could never regain any credit or au|thority;
and, at the &s;ame time, by the example of
<PB N="205" REF="202">
their fall, kept men from &s;ubmitting, with &s;uch blind
deference, to tho&s;e new &s;ects, which have attempted
to gain an a&s;cendant over them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>third</HI> ob&s;ervation, which I &s;hall form on this
head, of the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the arts and &s;ciences,
is, <HI>That tho' the only proper</HI> Nur&s;ery <HI>of the&s;e noble
plants be a free government, yet they may be tran&s;plant|ed
into any government; and that a republic is mo&s;t
favourable to the growth of the &s;ciences, and a civi|lized
monarchy to that of the polite arts.</HI></P>
<P>To balance a large &s;tate or &s;ociety, whether mo|narchical
or republican, on general laws, is a work
of &s;o great difficulty, that no human genius, how|ever
comprehen&s;ive, is able, by the mere dint of rea|&s;on
and reflection, to effect it. The judgments of
many mu&s;t unite in this work: Experience mu&s;t guide
their labour: Time mu&s;t bring it to perfection: And
the feeling of inconveniencies mu&s;t correct the mi&s;|takes,
which they inevitabily fall into, in their fir&s;t
trials and experiments. Hence the impo&s;&s;ibility ap|pears,
that this undertaking &s;hould be begun and
carried on in any monarchy; &s;ince &s;uch a form of
government, ere civilized, knows no other &s;ecret in
policy, than that of entru&s;ting unlimited powers with
every governor or magi&s;trate, and &s;ubdividing the
people into &s;o many cla&s;&s;es and orders of &s;lavery.
From &s;uch a &s;ituation, no improvements can ever be
<PB N="206" REF="203">
expected in the &s;ciences, in the liberal arts, in laws,
and &s;carce in the manual arts or manufactures. The
&s;ame barbari&s;m and ignorance, with which the go|vernment
commences, is propagated to all po&s;terity,
and can never come to a period by the efforts or inge|nuity
of &s;uch unhappy &s;laves.</P>
<P>BUT tho' law, the &s;ource of all &s;ecurity and hap|pine&s;s,
ari&s;es late in any government, and is the &s;low
product of order and of liberty, it is not pre&s;erved
with the &s;ame difficulty, with which it is produced;
but when it has once taken root, is a hardy plant,
which will &s;carce ever peri&s;h thro' the ill culture of
men, or the rigour of the &s;ea&s;ons. The arts of luxu|ry,
and much more the liberal arts, which depend
on a refined ta&s;te or &s;entiment, are ea&s;ily lo&s;t; be|cau&s;e
they are always reli&s;hed by a few only, who&s;e
lei&s;ure, fortune and genius fit them for &s;uch amu&s;e|ments.
But what is profitable to every mortal, and
in common life, when once di&s;covered, can &s;carce
ever peri&s;h, but by the total &s;ubver&s;ion of &s;ociety,
and by &s;uch furious inundations of barbarous inva|ders,
as obliterate all memory of former arts and
civility. Imitation al&s;o is apt to tran&s;port the&s;e
coar&s;er and more u&s;eful arts from one climate to an|other,
and make them precede the refined arts in
their progre&s;s; tho' perhaps they &s;prang after them
in their fir&s;t ri&s;e and propagation. From the&s;e cau&s;es
proceed civilized monarchies, where the arts of go|vernment,
<PB N="207" REF="204">
fir&s;t invented in free &s;tates, are pre&s;erved
to the mutual advantage and &s;ecurity of &s;overeign
and &s;ubject.</P>
<P>HOWEVER perfect, therefore, the monarchical
form may appear to &s;ome politicians, it owes all its
perfection to the republican; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, that
a pure de&s;poti&s;m, e&s;tabli&s;hed among a barbarous peo|ple
can ever, by its native force and energy, refine and
poli&s;h it&s;elf. It mu&s;t borrow its laws, and methods,
and in&s;titutions, and con&s;equently its &s;tability and
order, from free governments. The&s;e advantages are
the &s;ole growth of republics. The exten&s;ive de&s;po|ti&s;m
of a barbarous monarchy, by entering into the
detail of the government, as well as into the princi|pal
points of admini&s;tration, for ever prevents all &s;uch
improvements.</P>
<P>IN a civilized monarchy, the prince alone is un|re&s;trained
in the exerci&s;e of his authority, and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es
alone a power, which is not bounded by any
thing but cu&s;tom, example, and the &s;en&s;e of his own
intere&s;t. Every mini&s;ter or magi&s;trate, however emi|nent,
mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the general laws, which go|vern
the whole &s;ociety, and mu&s;t exert the autho|rity
delegated to him after the manner, which is pre|&s;cribed.
The people depend on none but their &s;o|vereign,
for the &s;ecurity of their property. He is
&s;o far removed from them, and is &s;o much exempt
<PB N="208" REF="205">
from private jealou&s;ies or intere&s;ts, that this depen|dence
is not felt. And thus a &s;pecies of government
ari&s;es, to which, in a high political rant, we may
give the name of <HI>Tyranny,</HI> but which, by a ju&s;t and
prudent admini&s;tration, may afford tolerable &s;ecurity
to the people, and may an&s;wer mo&s;t of the ends of
political &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT tho' in a civilized monarchy, as well as in a
republic, the people have &s;ecurity for the enjoyment
of their property; yet in both the&s;e forms of go|vernment,
tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;upreme authority
have the di&s;po&s;al of many honours and advantages,
which excite the ambition and avarice of mankind.
The only difference is, that in a republic, the can|didates
for offices mu&s;t look downwards, to gain the
&s;uffrages of the people; in a monarchy, they mu&s;t
turn their attention upwards to court the good graces
and favour of the great. To be &s;ucce&s;sful in the
former way, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for a man to make him|&s;elf
<HI>u&s;eful,</HI> by his indu&s;try, capacity, or knowlege:
To be pro&s;perous in the latter way, 'tis requi&s;ite for
him to render him&s;elf <HI>agreeable,</HI> by his wit, com|plai&s;ance,
or civility. A &s;trong genius &s;ucceeds be&s;t
in republics: A refined ta&s;te in monarchies. And
con&s;equently the &s;ciences are the more natural growth
of the one, and the polite arts of the other.</P>
<P><PB N="209" REF="206">
NOT to mention, that monarchies, receiving their
chief &s;tability from a &s;uper&s;titious reverence to prie&s;ts
and princes, have almo&s;t always abriged the liberty
of rea&s;oning, with regard to religion and politics,
and con&s;equently metaphy&s;ics and morals. All the&s;e
form the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branches of &s;cience. Ma|thematics
and natural philo&s;ophy, which only re|main,
are not half &s;o valuable.</P>
<P>THERE is a very great connection among all the
arts, which contribute to plea&s;ure; and the &s;ame
delicacy of ta&s;te, which enables us to make im|provements
in one, will not allow the others to re|main
altogether rude and barbarous. Among&s;t all
the arts of conver&s;ation, no one plea&s;es more than
mutual deference or civility, which leads us to re&s;ign
our own inclinations to tho&s;e of our companion, and
to curb and conceal that pre&s;umption and arrogance
&s;o natural to the human mind. A good-natured man,
who is well educated, practi&s;es this civility to every
mortal, without premeditation or intere&s;t. But, in
order to render that valuable quality general among
any people, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;&s;i&s;t the natural
di&s;po&s;itions by &s;ome general motive. Where power
ri&s;es upwards from the people to the great, as in
all republics, &s;uch refinements of civility are apt to
be little practi&s;ed, &s;ince the whole &s;tate are, by that
means, brought near to a level, and every member
of it is rendered, in a great mea&s;ure, independent of
<PB N="210" REF="207">
another. The people have the advantage, by the
authority of their &s;uffrages: The great, by the &s;u|periority
of their &s;tation. But in a civilized mo|narchy,
there is a long train of dependence from the
prince to the pea&s;ant, which is not great enough
to render property precarious, or depre&s;s the minds
of the people; but is &s;ufficient to beget in every one
an inclination to plea&s;e his &s;uperiors, and to form
him&s;elf upon tho&s;e models, which are mo&s;t accep|table
to people of condition and education. Polite|ne&s;s
of manners, therefore, ari&s;es mo&s;t naturally in
monarchies and courts; and where that flouri&s;hes,
none of the liberal arts will be altogether neglected
or de&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE republics in EUROPE are at pre&s;ent noted for
want of politene&s;s. <HI>The good manners of a</HI> SWISS

among the FRENCH. The ENGLISH, in &s;ome
degree, fall under the &s;ame cen&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding
their learning and genius. And if the VENETIANS
be an exception to the rule, they owe it, perhaps,
to their communication with the other ITALIANS,
mo&s;t of who&s;e governments beget a dependence more
than &s;ufficient for civilizing their manners.</P>
<P><PB N="211" REF="208">
'Tis difficult to pronounce any judgment concern|ing
the refinements of the ancient republics in this
particular: But I am apt to &s;u&s;pect, that the arts of
conver&s;ation were not brought &s;o near perfection a|mong
them as the arts of writing and compo&s;ition.
The &s;currility of the ancient orators, in many in|&s;tances,
is quite &s;hocking, and exceeds all belief.
Vanity too is often not a little offen&s;ive in authors
of that age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">'Tis needle&s;s to cite CICERO or PLINY on this head: They are too much noted: But one is a little &s;urprized to find ARRIAN, a very grave, judicious writer, interrupt the thread of his narration all of a &s;udden to tell his readers that he him|&s;elf is as eminent among the GREEKS for eloquence as ALEX|ANDER was for arms.

expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>I SHALL al&s;o be &s;o bold, as to affirm, That a|mong
the ancients, there was not much delicacy of
breeding, or that polite deference and re&s;pect, which
civility obliges us either to expre&s;s or counterfeit
towards the per&s;ons with whom we conver&s;e C$|CERO
was certainly one of the polite&s;t gentlemen
of his age; and yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have frequent|ly
been &s;hocked with the poor figure under which he
repre&s;ents his friend ATTICUS, in tho&s;e dialogues,
where he him&s;elf is introduced as a &s;peaker. That
learned and virtuous ROMAN, who&s;e dignity, tho'
he was only a private gentleman, was inferior to that
of no one in ROME, is there &s;hewn in rather a
more pitiful light than PHILALETHES'S friend in our
modern dialogues. He is a humble admirer of the
orator, pays him frequent compliments, and receives
his in&s;tructions, with all the deference that a &s;cholar
owes to his ma&s;ter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">ATT. Non mihi videtur ad beate vivendum &s;atis e&s;&s;e vir|tutem. MAR. At hercule BRUTO meo videtur; cujus ego ju|dicium, pace tua dixerim, longe antepono tuo. TUSC. Quae. lib. 5.</NOTE>. Even CATO is treated in &s;ome|what

any thing on that head among the diffe|rent

before him, as he always does on other occa|&s;ions.
There is al&s;o a &s;pirit of dialogue ob&s;erved
in the eloquent books <HI>de Oratore,</HI> and a tolerable
equality maintained among the &s;peakers: But then
the&s;e &s;peakers are the great men of the age pre|ceding
the author, and he recounts the conference
as only from hear&s;ay.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t particular details of a real dia|logue,
which we meet with in antiquity is related
by POLYBIUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE>, when PHILIP, king of MACEDON,
a prince of wit and parts, met with TITUS FLA|MININUS,
one of the polite&s;t of the ROMANS as
we learn from PLUTARCH<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In vita FLAMIN.</NOTE>, accompanied with
amba&s;&s;adors from almo&s;t all the GREEK cities.
The AETOLIAN amba&s;&s;ador very abruptly tells the
<PB N="214" REF="211">
king, that he talked like a fool or a madman (<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">)
<HI>That's evident,</HI> &s;ays his maje&s;ty, <HI>even to a blind man;</HI>
which was a raillery on the blindne&s;s of his excellency.
Yet all this pa&s;t not the u&s;ual bounds: For the confe|rence
was not di&s;turbed; and FLAMININUS was very
well diverted with the&s;e &s;trokes of humour. At the
end, when PHILIP craved a little time to con&s;ult with
his friends, of whom he had none pre&s;ent, the RO|MAN
general, being de&s;irous al&s;o to &s;hew his wit, as
the hi&s;torian &s;ays, tells him, <HI>that perhaps the rea&s;on,
why he had none of his friends with him, was becau&s;e
he had murdered them all;</HI> which was actually the ca&s;e.
This unprovoked piece of ru&s;ticity is not condemned
by the hi&s;torian, cau&s;ed no farther re&s;entment in
PHILIP, than to excite a SARDONIAN &s;mile, or what
we call a grin, and hindered him not from renewing
the conference next day. PLUTARCH<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In vita FLAMIN.</NOTE> too mentions
this raillery among&s;t the witty and agreeable &s;ayings
of FLAMININUS.</P>
<P>'Tis but an indifferent compliment, which HO|RACE

of love, or ari&s;es from reflections on duty and con|venience?
Nothing, therefore, can proceed le&s;s from
affectation than the pa&s;&s;ion of gallantry. 'Tis <HI>natu|ral</HI>
in the hige&s;t degree. Art and education, in the
mo&s;t elegant courts, make no more alternation on it,
than on all the other laudable pa&s;&s;ions. They only
turn the mind more towards it; they refine it; they
poli&s;h it; and give it a proper grace and expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT gallantry is as <HI>generous</HI> as it is <HI>natural.</HI> To
correct &s;uch gro&s;s vices, as lead us to commit a real
injury to others, is the part of morals, and the ob|ject
<PB N="220" REF="217">
of the mo&s;t ordinary education. Where <HI>that</HI> is
not attended to, in &s;ome degree, no human &s;ociety
can &s;ub&s;i&s;t. But in order to render conver&s;ation,
and the intercour&s;e of minds more ea&s;y and agree|able,
Good-manners have been invented, and have
carried the matter &s;omewhat farther. Wherever na|ture
has given the mind a propen&s;ity to any vice, or
to any pa&s;&s;ion di&s;agreeable to others, refined breeding
has taught men to throw the bya&s;s on the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide, and to pre&s;erve, in all their behaviour, the ap|pearance
of &s;entiments contrary to tho&s;e which they
naturally incline to. Thus, as we are commonly
proud and &s;elfi&s;h, and apt to a&s;&s;ume the preference
above others, a polite man learns to behave with de|ference
towards tho&s;e with whom he conver&s;es, and
to yield the &s;uperiority to them in all the common in|cidents
of &s;ociety. In like manner, wherever a per|&s;on's
&s;ituation may naturally beget any di&s;agreable
&s;u&s;picion in him, 'tis the part of good-manners to
prevent it, by a &s;tudied di&s;play of &s;entiments, directly
contrary to tho&s;e of which he is apt to be jealous.
Thus, old men known their infirmities, and naturally
dread contempt from the youth: Hence, well-edu|cated
youth, redouble the in&s;tances of re&s;pect and de|ference
to their elders. Strangers and foreigners are
without protection: Hence, in all polite countries,
they receive the highe&s;t civilities, and are intitled to
the fir&s;t place in every company. A man is lord in
his own family, and his gue&s;ts are, in a manner, &s;ub|ject
<PB N="221" REF="218">
to his authority: Hence, he is always the lowe&s;t
per&s;on in the company; attentive to the wants of
every one; and giving him&s;elf all the trouble, in or|der
to plea&s;e, which may not betray too vi&s;ible an
affectation, or impo&s;e too much con&s;traint on his
gue&s;ts<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The frequent mention in ancient authors of that ill-br$d cu&s;tom of the ma&s;ter of the family's eating better bread or drink|ing better wine at table, than he afforded his gue&s;ts, is but an indifferent mark of the civility of tho&s;e ages. See JUVENAL. fat. 5. PLINI$, lib. 14. cap. 13. Al&s;o PLINI$ <HI>Epi&s;t. Lucian de mercede conductis, Saturnalia,</HI> &amp;c. There is &s;carce any part of EUROPE at pre&s;ent &s;o uncivilized as to admit of &s;uch a cu&s;tom.</NOTE>. Gallantry is nothing but an in&s;tance of the
&s;ame generous and refined attention. As nature has
given <HI>man</HI> the &s;uperiority above <HI>woman,</HI> by endowing
him with greater &s;trength both of mind and body;
'tis his part to alleviate that &s;uperiority, as much as
po&s;&s;ible, by the genero&s;ity of his behaviour, and by
a &s;tudied deference and complai&s;ance for all her incli|nations
and opinions. Barbarous nations di&s;play this
&s;uperiority, by reducing their females to the mo&s;t ab|ject
&s;lavery; by con$ining them, by beating them, by
&s;elling them, by killing them. But the male &s;ex,
among a polite people, di&s;cover their authority in a
more generous, tho' not a le&s;s evident manner; by
civility, by re&s;pect, by complai&s;ance, and, in a word,
by gallantry. In good company, you need not a&s;k,
Who is the ma&s;ter of the fea&s;t? The man who &s;its in
<PB N="222" REF="219">
the lowe&s;t place, and who is always indu&s;trious in help|ing
every one, is mo&s;t certainly the per&s;on. We
mu&s;t either condemn all &s;uch in&s;tances of genero&s;ity,
as foppi&s;h and affected, or admit of gallantry among
the re$t. The ancient MUSCOVITES wedded their
wives with a whip, in&s;tead of a wedding-ring. The
&s;ame people, in their own hou&s;es, took always the
precedency above foreigners, even<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Relation of three emba&s;&s;ies,</HI> by the earl of CARLILE.</NOTE> foreign amba&s;&s;a|dors.
The&s;e two in&s;tances of their genero&s;ity and po|litene&s;s
are much of a piece.</P>
<P>GALLANTRY is not le&s;s con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and
<HI>prudence,</HI> than with <HI>n$ture</HI> and <HI>genero&s;ity;</HI> and when
under proper regulations, contributes, more than any
other invention, to the <HI>entertainment</HI> and <HI>improvement</HI>
of the youth of both &s;exes. In all vegetables, 'tis
ob&s;ervable, that the flower and the &s;eed are always
connected together; and in like manner, among
every &s;pecies of animals, nature has founded on the
love between the &s;exes their &s;weete&s;t and be&s;t enjoy|ment.
But the &s;atisfaction of the bodily appetite is
not alone of great value; and even among brute
creatu$es, we find, that their play and dalliance, and
other expre&s;&s;ions of fondne&s;s, form the greate&s;t part
of the entertainment. In rational beings, we mu&s;t
certainly admit the mind for a con&s;iderable &s;hare.
Were we to rob the fea&s;t of all its garniture of rea&s;on,
<PB N="223" REF="220">
di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ympathy, friend&s;hip, and gaiety, what re|mains
would &s;carce be worth acceptance, in the judg|ment
of the truly elegant and luxurious.</P>
<P>WHAT better &s;chool for manners, than the com|pany
of virtuous women; where the mutual endea|vour
to plea&s;e mu&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly poli&s;h the mind, where
the example of the female &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty mu&s;t
communicate it&s;elf to their admirers, and where the
delicacy of that &s;ex puts every one on his guard, le&s;t
he give offence by any breach of decency?</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, That my own particular choice
rather leads me to prefer the company of a few &s;elect
companions, with whom I can, calmly and peaceably,
enjoy the fea&s;t of rea&s;on, and try the ju&s;tne&s;s of every
reflection, whether gay or &s;erious, that may occur to
me. But as &s;uch a delightful &s;ociety is not every day
to be met with, I mu&s;t think, that mixt companies,
without the fair-&s;ex, are the mo&s;t in&s;ipid entertain|ment
in the world, and de&s;titute of gaiety and polite|ne&s;s,
as much as of &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on. Nothing can
keep them from exce&s;&s;ive dulne&s;s but hard drinking;
a remedy wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>AMONG the ancients, the character of the fair-&s;ex
was con&s;idered as altogether dome&s;tic, nor were they
regarded as part of the polite world, or of good com|pany.
This, perhaps, is the true rea&s;on why the an|cients
have not left us one piece of plea&s;antry, that
<PB N="224" REF="221">
is excellent, (unle&s;s one may except the banquet of
XENOPHON, and the dialogues of LUCIAN) tho' ma|ny
of their &s;erious compo&s;itions are altogether inimi|table.
HORACE condemns the coar&s;e railleries and
cold je&s;ts of PLAUTUS: But, tho' the mo&s;t ea&s;y, agree|able,
and judicious writer in the world, is his own
talent for ridicule very &s;triking or refined? This,
therefore, is one con&s;iderable improvement, which the
polite arts have received from gallantry, and from
courts, where it fir&s;t aro&s;e.</P>
<P>THE point of <HI>honour,</HI> or duelling, is a modern in|vention,
as well as <HI>gallantry;</HI> and by &s;ome e&s;teemed
equally u&s;e&s;ul for the refining of manners: But how
it has contributed to that effect, I am at a lo&s;s to de|termine.
Conver&s;ation, among the greate&s;t ru&s;tics,
is not commonly infe&s;ted with &s;uch rudene&s;s as can
give occa&s;ion to duels, even according to the mo&s;t
refined laws of this fanta&s;tic honour; and, as to the
other &s;mall indecencies, which are the mo&s;t offen&s;ive,
becau&s;e the mo&s;t frequent, they can never be cured
by the practice of duelling. But the&s;e notions are
not only <HI>u&s;ele&s;s:</HI> They are al&s;o <HI>pernicious.</HI> By &s;eparat|ing
the man of honour from the man of virtue, the
greate&s;t profligates have got &s;omething to value them|&s;elves
upon, and have been able to keep them&s;elves
in countenance, tho' guilty of the mo&s;t &s;hameful and
mo&s;t dangerous vices. They are debauchees, &s;pend|thri&s;ts,
and never pay a farthing they owe: But they
<PB N="225" REF="222">
are men of honour; and therefore are to be received
as gentlemen in all companies.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome of the parts of modern honour,
which are the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential parts of morality; &s;uch
as fidelity, the ob&s;erving promi&s;es, and telling truth.
The&s;e points of honour Mr. ADDISON had in his eye,
when he made JUBA &s;ay,
<Q><L>Honour's a &s;acred tye, the law of kings,</L>
<L>The noble mind's di&s;tingui&s;hing perfection,</L>
<L>That aids and &s;trengthens virtue, when it meets her,</L>
<L>And imitates her actions where &s;he is not:</L>
<L>It ought not to be &s;ported with.</L></Q></P>
<P>The&s;e lines are very beautiful: But I am afraid, that
Mr. ADDISON has here been guilty of that impropriety
of &s;entiment, with which, on other occa&s;ions, he has
&s;o ju&s;tly reproached our poets. The ancients certainly
never had any notion of <HI>honour</HI> as di&s;tinct from <HI>vir|tue.</HI></P>
<P>BUT,
to return from this digre&s;&s;ion, I &s;hall advance
it as a <HI>fourth</HI> ob&s;ervation on this, of the ri&s;e and pro|gre&s;s
of the arts and &s;ciences, <HI>That when the arts and
&s;ciences come to perfection in any &s;tate, from that moment
they naturally, or rather nece&s;&s;arily decline, and &s;el$om
or never revive in that nation, where they formerly
flouri&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="223">
IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that this maxim, tho' co$|formable
to experience, may, at fir&s;t &s;ight, be e&s;teem|ed
very contrary to rea&s;on. If the natural genius of
mankind be the &s;ame in all ages, and in almo&s;t all
countries, (as I am of opinion it is) it mu&s;t very much
forward and cultivate this genius, to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
exact patterns in every art, which may regulate the
ta&s;te, and fix the objects of imitation. The mo|dels
left us by the ancients gave birth to all the arts
about 200 years ago, and have mightily advanced
their progre&s;s in every country of EUROPE: Why
had they not a like effect during the reign of TRAJAN
and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, when they were much more entire,
and were &s;till admired and &s;tudied by the whole world?
So late as the emperor JUSTINIAN, the POET, by way
of di&s;tinction, was under&s;tood, among the GREEKS,
to be HOMER; among the ROMANS, VIRGIL. Such
admiration &s;till remained for the&s;e divine geniu&s;es;
tho' no poet had appeared for many centuries, who
could juftly pretend to have imitated them.</P>
<P>A MAN'S genius is always, in the beginning of his
life, as much unknown to him&s;elf as to others; and
'tis only after frequent trials, attended with &s;ucce&s;s,
that he dares think him&s;elf equal to tho&s;e undertak|ings,
in which they who have &s;ucceeded, have fixed
the admiration of mankind. If his own nation be
already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of many models of eloquence, he na|turally
compares his own juvenile exerci&s;es with the&s;e;
<PB N="227" REF="224">
and being &s;en&s;ible of the infinite di&s;proportion betwixt
them, is di&s;couraged from any further attempts, and
never aims at a rival&s;hip with tho&s;e authors, whom he
&s;o much admires. A noble emulation is the &s;ource of
every excellence. Admiration and mode&s;ty naturally
extingui&s;h this emulation. And no one is &s;o liable to
an exce&s;s of admiration and mode&s;ty, as a truly great
genius.</P>
<P>NEXT to emulation, the greate&s;t encourager of the
noble arts is prai&s;e and glory. A writer is animated
with new force, when he hears the applau&s;es of the
world for his former productions; and, being rouzed
by &s;uch a motive, he often reaches a pitch of perfec|tion,
which is equally &s;urprizing to him&s;elf and to his
readers. But when the po&s;ts of honour are all occu|pied,
his fir&s;t attempts are but coldly received by the
public; being compared to productions, which are
both in them&s;elves more excellent, and have already
the advantage of an e&s;tabli&s;hed reputation. Were
MOLIERE and CORNEILLE to bring upon the &s;tage
at pre&s;ent their early productions, which were for|merly
&s;o well received, it would di&s;courage the young
poets, to &s;ee the indifference and di&s;dain of the pub|lic.
The ignorance of the age alone could have
given admi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Prince of</HI> TYRE; but 'tis to
that we owe <HI>the Moo:.</HI> Had <HI>Every man in his humour</HI>
been rejected, we had never &s;een VOLPONE.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="225">
PERHAPS it may not be for the advantage of any
nation, to have the arts imported from their neigh|bours
in too great perfection. This extingui&s;hes emu|lation,
and &s;inks the ardor of the generous youth.
So many models of ITALIAN painting brought into
BRITAIN, in&s;tead of exciting our arti&s;ts, is the cau&s;e
of their &s;mall progre&s;s in that noble art. The &s;ame,
perhaps, was the ca&s;e of ROME, when it received the
arts from GREECE. That multitude of polite pro|ductions
in the FRENCH language, di&s;per&s;ed all over
GERMANY and the NORTH, hinder the&s;e nations
from cultivating their own language, and keep them
&s;till dependent on their neighbours for tho&s;e elegant
entertainments.</P>
<P>'TIS true, the ancients had left us models in every
kind of writing, which are highly worthy of admi|ration.
But be&s;ides that they were wrote in lan|guages,
which were known only to the learned; be|&s;ides
this, I &s;ay, the compari&s;on is not &s;o perfect nor
intire between modern wits, and tho&s;e who lived in
&s;o remote an age. Had WALLER been born in
ROME, during the reign of TIBERIUS, his fir&s;t pro|ductions
had been de&s;pi&s;ed, when compared to the
fini&s;hed odes of HORACE. But in this i&s;land the &s;upe|riority
of the ROMAN poet dimini&s;hed nothing from
the fame of the ENGLISH. We e&s;teemed our&s;elves
&s;ufficiently happy, that our climate and language
<PB N="229" REF="226">
could produce but a faint copy of &s;o excellent an
original.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the arts and &s;ciences, like &s;ome plants,
require a fre&s;h &s;oil; and however rich the land
may be, and however you may recruit it by art or
care, it will never, when once exhau&s;ted, produce
any thing that is perfect or fini&s;hed in the kind.</P>

I have given each of them the name of the philo|&s;ophical &s;ect, to which it bears the greate&s;t affinity.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS a great mortification to the vanity of man,
that his utmo&s;t art and indu&s;try can never
equal the meane&s;t of nature's productions, either for
beauty or value. Art is only the underworkman, and
is employed to give a few &s;trokes of embelli&s;hment
to tho&s;e pieces, which come from the hand of the
ma&s;ter. Some of the drapery may be of his drawing;
but he is not allowed to touch the principal figure.
Art may make a $uit of clothes: But nature mu&s;t pro|duce
a man.</P>
<P>EVEN in tho&s;e productions, which are commonly
denominated works of art, we find, that the noble&s;t
<PB N="232" REF="228">
of the kind are beholden for their chief beauty to
the force and happy influence of nature. To the
<HI>Oe&s;trum</HI> or native enthu&s;ia&s;m of the poets, we owe
whatever is admirable in their productions. The
greate&s;t genius, where nature at any time fails him
(for &s;he is not equal) throws a&s;ide the lyre, and hopes
not, from the rules of art, to reach that divine har|mony,
which mu&s;t proceed from her in&s;piration alone.
How poor are tho&s;e &s;ongs, where a happy flow of
fancy has not furni&s;hed materials for art to embelli&s;h

<P>BUT of all the fruitle&s;s attempts of art, no one is
&s;o ridiculous, as that which the &s;evere philo&s;ophers

and making us be plea&s;ed by rules of rea|&s;on,
and by reflection. Why did none of them
claim the reward, which XERXES promi&s;ed to him,
who could invent a new plea&s;ure? Unle&s;s, perhaps,
they invented &s;o many plea&s;ures for their own u&s;e, that
they de&s;pi&s;ed riches, and &s;tood in no need of any en|joyments,
which the rewards of that monarch could
procure them. I am apt, indeed, to think, that
they were not willing to furni&s;h the PERSIAN court
with a new plea&s;ure, by pre&s;enting it with &s;o new and
$nu&s;ual an object of ridicule. Their &s;peculations,
when confined to theory; and gravely delivered in the
&s;chools of GREECE, might excite admiration in their
ignorant pupils: But the attempting to reduce &s;uch

principles to practice would &s;oon betray their ab|&s;urdity.</P>
<P>YOU pretend to make me happy by rea&s;on, and by
rules of art. You mu&s;t, then, create me anew by
rules of art. For on my original frame and &s;tructure
does my happine&s;s depend. But you want power to
effect this; and &s;kill too, I am afraid: Nor can I en|tertain
a le&s;s opinion of nature's wi&s;dom than of yours.
And let her conduct the machine, which &s;he has &s;o
wi&s;ely framed. I find, that I &s;hould only &s;poil it by
my tampering.</P>
<P>TO what purpo&s;e &s;hould I pretend to regulate, re|fine,
or invigorate any of tho&s;e &s;prings or principles,
which nature has implanted in me? Is this the road
by which I mu&s;t reach happine&s;s? But happine&s;s im|plies
ea&s;e, contentment, repo&s;e and plea&s;ure; not
watchfulne&s;s, care, and fatigue. The health of my
body con&s;i&s;ts in the facility with which all its opera|tions
are performed. The &s;tomach dige&s;ts the ali|ments:
The heart circulates the blood: The brain
&s;eparates $nd refines the &s;pirits: And all this without
my concerning my&s;elf in the matter. When by my

the cour&s;e of my &s;entiments and pa&s;&s;ions. In vain
&s;hould I &s;train my faculties, and endeavour to receive

<HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> &s;miles at my languor. She beckens her &s;i&s;ter,
<HI>Virtue,</HI> to come to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The gay, the fro|lic

welcome, my ever dear companions, to the&s;e &s;hady
bowers, and to this luxurious repa&s;t. Your pre&s;ence

again play around my heart; while you partake of
my delights, and di&s;cover in your chearful looks, the
plea&s;ure which you receive from my happine&s;s and

<P>IN our chearful di&s;cour&s;es, better than in the for|mal

and while we yet po&s;&s;e&s;s a being, let us fix
&s;ome good, beyond the power of fate or fortune.
To-morrow will bring its own plea&s;ures along with
it: Or &s;hould it di&s;appoint our fond wi&s;hes, we &s;hall

Words are too faint to de&s;cribe my love; and if, alas!

the pre&s;ent moment, and lo&s;e no part of &s;o peri&s;hable

Our fruitle&s;s anxieties, our vain projects, our

lo&s;t. Our pre&s;ent doubts, concerning the original
cau&s;e of all things, mu&s;t never, alas! be re&s;olved.
This alone we may be certain of, that if any govern|ing
mind pre&s;ide over the univer&s;e, he mu&s;t be plea&s;ed

plea&s;ure, for which alone we were created. Let this
reflection give ea&s;e to your anxious thoughts; but

<P>THERE is this obvious and material difference
in the conduct of nature, with regard to man
and other animals, that having endowed the former
with a &s;ublime cele&s;tial &s;pirit, and having given him
an affinity with &s;uperior beings, &s;he allows not &s;uch
noble faculties to lie lethargic or idle; but urges him,
by nece&s;&s;ity, to employ, on every emergence, his ut|mo&s;t
<HI>art</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try.</HI> Brute creatures have many of
their nece&s;&s;ities &s;upplied by nature, being cloathed and
armed by this beneficent parent of all things: And
where their own <HI>indu&s;try</HI> is requi&s;ite on any occa&s;ion,
nature, by implanting in&s;tincts, &s;till &s;upplies them
with the <HI>art,</HI> and guides them to their good, by her
unerring precepts. But man, expo&s;ed naked and in|digent
to the rude elements, ri&s;es &s;lowly from that
helple&s;s &s;tate, by the care and vigilance of his pa|rents;
and having attained his utmo&s;t growth and
<PB N="244" REF="239">
perfection, reaches only a capacity of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, by
his own care and vigilance. Every thing is &s;old to
&s;kill and labour; and where nature furni&s;hes the ma|terials,
they are &s;till rude and unfini&s;hed, till indu&s;try,
every active and intelligent, refines them from their
brute &s;tate, and fits them for human u&s;e and conve|nience.</P>
<P>ACKNOWLEGE, therefore, O man, the beneficence
of nature: For &s;he has given thee that intelligence
which &s;upplies all thy nece&s;&s;ities. But let not indo|lence,
under the fal&s;e appearance of gratitude, per|&s;uade
thee to re&s;t contented with her pre&s;ents. Would'&s;t
thou return to the raw herbage for thy food, to the
open &s;ky for they covering, and to &s;tones and clubs for
thy defence again&s;t the ravenous animals of the de|&s;ert?
Then return al&s;o to thy &s;avage manners, to thy
timorous &s;uper&s;tition, to thy brutal ignorance; and
&s;ink thy&s;elf below tho&s;e animals, who&s;e condition
thou admire&s;t, and woulde&s;t &s;o fondly imitate.</P>
<P>THY kind parent, nature, having given thee art
and intelligence, has filled the whole globe with ma|terials
for the&s;e talents to work upon: Hearken to her
voice, which &s;o plainly tells thee, that thou thy&s;elf
&s;houlde&s;t al&s;o be the object of thy indu&s;try, and that
by art and attention thou can&s;t alone acquire that abi|lity,
which will rai&s;e thee to thy proper &s;tation in the
univer&s;e. Behold this artizan, who converts a rude
<PB N="245" REF="240">
and &s;hapele&s;s &s;tone into a noble metal; and molding
that metal by his cunning hands, creates, as it were
by magic, every weapon for his defence, and every
uten&s;il for his convenience. He has not this &s;kill
from nature: U&s;e and practice have taught it him:
And if thou woulde&s;t emulate his &s;ucce&s;s, thou mu&s;t
follow his laborious foot&s;teps.</P>
<P>BUT while thou <HI>ambitiou&s;ly</HI> a&s;pire&s;t to the perfecting
thy bodily powers and faculties, woulde&s;t thou <HI>meanly</HI>
neglect thy mind, and from a prepo&s;terous &s;loth,
leave it &s;till rude and uncultivated, as it came from
the hands of nature? Far be &s;uch folly and negli|gence
from every rational being. If nature has been
frugal in her gifts and endowments, there is the more
need of art to &s;upply her defects. If &s;he has been ge|nerous
and liberal, know that &s;he &s;till expects indu&s;try
and application on our part, and revenges her&s;elf in
proportion to our negligent ingratitude. The riche&s;t
genius, like the mo&s;t fertile &s;oil, when uncultivated,
&s;hoots up into the ranke&s;t weeds; and in&s;tead of vines
and olives for the plea&s;ure and u&s;e of man, produces,
to its &s;lothful owner, the mo&s;t abundant crop of poi|&s;ons.</P>
<P>THE great end of all human indu&s;try, is the attain|ment
of happine&s;s. For this were arts invented, &s;ci|ences
cultivated, laws ordained, and &s;ocieties model|led,
by the profounde&s;t wi&s;dom of patriots and legi&s;|lators.
<PB N="246" REF="241">
Even the lonely &s;avage, who lies expo&s;ed to
the inclemency of the elements, and the fury of wild
bea&s;ts, forgets not, for a moment, this grand object of
his being. Ignorant as he is of every art of life, he
keeps &s;till in view the end of all tho&s;e arts, and ea|gerly
&s;eeks for felicity amid&s;t that darkne&s;s with which
he is environed. But as much as the wilde&s;t &s;avage is
inferior to the poli&s;hed citizen, who, under the
protection of laws, enjoys every convenience which
indu&s;try has invented; &s;o much is this citizen him&s;elf
inferior to the man of virtue, and the true philo|&s;opher,
who governs his appetites, &s;ubdues his pa&s;|&s;ions,
and has learned, from rea&s;on, to &s;et a ju&s;t va|lue
on every pur&s;uit and enjoyment. For is there an
art and apprentice&s;hip requi&s;ite for every other attain|ment?
And is there no art of life, no rule, no pre|cepts
to direct us in this principal concern? Can no
particular plea&s;ure be attained without &s;kill; and can
the whole be regulated without reflection or intelli|gence,
by the blind guidance of appetite and in&s;tinct?
Surely then no mi&s;takes are ever committed in this
a fair; but every man, however di&s;&s;olute and negli|gent,
proceeds in the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s, with as
unerring a motion, as that which the cele&s;tial bodies
ob&s;erve, when, conducted by the hand of the Al|mighty,
they roll along the ethereal plains. But if
mi&s;takes be often, be inevitably committed, let us re|gi&s;ter
the&s;e mi&s;takes; let us con&s;ider their cau&s;es; let
us weight their importance; let us inquire for their
<PB N="247" REF="242">
remedies. When from this we have fixed all the
rules of conduct, we are <HI>philo&s;ophers:</HI> When we have
reduced the&s;e rules to practice, we are <HI>&s;ages.</HI></P>
<P>LIKE many &s;ubordinate arti&s;ts, employed to form
the &s;everal wheels and &s;prings of a machine: Such
are tho&s;e who excel in all the particular arts of life. <HI>He</HI>
is the ma&s;ter workman who puts tho&s;e &s;everal parts
together, moves them according to ju&s;t harmony and
proportion, and produces true felicity as the re&s;ult of
their con&s;piring order.</P>
<P>WHILE thou ha&s;t &s;uch an alluring object in view,
&s;hall that labour and attention, which is requi&s;ite to
the attaining thy end, ever &s;eem burden&s;ome and into|lerable?
Know, that this labour it&s;elf is the chief in|gredient
of the &s;elicity to which thou a&s;pire&s;t, and
that every enjoyment &s;oon becomes in&s;ipid and di&s;|ta&s;teful,
when not acquired by fatigue and indu&s;try.
See the hardy hunters ri&s;e from their downy couches,
&s;hake off the &s;lumbers which &s;till weigh down their
heavy eye-lids, and, ere <HI>Aurora</HI> has yet covered the
heavens with her flaming mantle, ha&s;ten to the fore&s;t.
They leave behind, in their own hou&s;es, and in the
neighbouring plaine, animals of every kind, who&s;e

them&s;elves to the fatal &s;troke. Laborious man
di&s;dains &s;o ea&s;y a purcha&s;e. He &s;eeks for a prey,
which hides it&s;elf from his &s;earch, or flies from his
<PB N="248" REF="243">
pur&s;uit, or defends it&s;elf from his violence. Having
exerted in the chace every pa&s;&s;ion of the mind, and
every member of the body, he then finds the charms
of repo&s;e, and with joy compares its plea&s;ures to tho&s;e
of his engaging labours.</P>
<P>AND can vigorous indu&s;try give plea&s;ure to the
pur&s;uit even of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s prey, which fre|quently
e&s;capes our toils? And cannot the &s;ame in|du&s;try
render the cultivating our mind, the modera|ting
our pa&s;&s;ions, the enlightening our rea&s;on, an
agreeable occupation; while we are every day &s;en|&s;ible
of our progre&s;s, and behold our inward features
and countenance brightening ince&s;&s;antly with new
charms? Begin by curing your&s;elf of this lethargic
indolence; the ta&s;k is not difficult: You need but
ta&s;te the &s;weets of hone&s;t labour. Proceed to learn
the ju&s;t value of every pur&s;uit; long &s;tudy is not re|qui&s;ite:
Compare, tho' but for once, the mind to the
body, virtue to fortune, and glory to plea&s;ure. You
will then perceive the advantages of indu&s;try: You
will then be &s;en&s;ible what are the proper objects of
your indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IN vain do you &s;eek repo&s;e from beds of ro&s;es: In
vain do you hope for enjoyment from the mo&s;t deli|cious
wines and fruits. Your indolence it&s;elf becomes
a fatigue. Your plea&s;ure it&s;elf creates di&s;gu&s;t. The
mind, unexerci&s;ed, finds every delight in&s;ipid and
<PB N="249" REF="244">
loath&s;ome; and ere yet the body, full of noxious
humours, feels the torment of its multiplied di&s;ea&s;es,
your nobler part is &s;en&s;ible of the invading poi&s;on,
and &s;eeks in vain to relieve its anxiety by new plea|&s;ures,
which &s;till augement the fatal malady.</P>
<P>I NEED not tell you, that by this eager pur&s;uit of
plea&s;ure, you more and more expo&s;e your&s;elf to for|tune
and accidents, and rivet your affections on ex|ternal
objects, which chance may, in a moment, ra|vi&s;h
from you. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that your indulgent
&s;tars favour you &s;till with the enjoyment of your
riches and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. I prove to you, that even in
the mid&s;t of your luxurious plea&s;ures, you are un|happy;
and that, by too much indulgence, you are
incapable of enjoying what pro&s;perous fortune &s;till al|lows
you to po&s;&s;e&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT &s;urely the in&s;tability of fortune is a con&s;ider|ation
not to be over looked or neglected. Happine&s;s
cannot po&s;&s;ibly exi&s;t, where there is no &s;ecurity; and
&s;ecurity can have no place, where fortune has any
dominion. Tho' that un&s;table deity &s;hould not exert
her rage again&s;t you, the dread of it would &s;till tor|ment
you; would di&s;turb your &s;lumbers, haunt your
dreams, and throw a damp on the jollity of your mo&s;t
delicious banquets.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="245">
THE temple of wi&s;dom is &s;eated on a rock, above
the rage of the fighting elements, and inacce&s;&s;ible to
all the malice of man. The rolling thunder breaks
below; and tho&s;e more terrible in&s;truments of human
fury reach not to &s;o &s;ublime a height. The &s;age,
while he breathes that &s;erene air, looks down with
plea&s;ure, mixed with compa&s;&s;ion, on the errors of

of life, and pur&s;ue riches, nobility, honour, or
power, for genuine felicity. The greate&s;t part he
beholds di&s;appointed of their fond wi&s;hes: Some la|ment,
that having once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the object of their
de&s;ires, it is ravi&s;hed from them by envious fortune:
And all complain, that even their own vows, tho'
granted, cannot give them happine&s;s, or relieve the
anxiety of their di&s;tracted minds.</P>
<P>BUT does the &s;age preferve him&s;elf always in this
philo&s;ophic indifference, and re&s;t contented with la|menting
the mi&s;eries of mankind, without ever em|ploying
him&s;elf for their relief? Does he con&s;tantly
indulge this &s;evere wi&s;dom, which, by pretending to
elevate him above human accidents, does in reality
harden his heart, and render him carele&s;s of the in|tere&s;ts
of mankind, and of &s;ociety? No: he knows
that in this &s;ullen <HI>Apathy,</HI> neither true wi&s;dom nor
true happine&s;s are to be found. He feels too &s;trong|ly
the charm of the &s;ocial affections ever the counteract
&s;o &s;weet, &s;o natural, &s;o virtous a propen&s;ity. Even
<PB N="251" REF="246">
when, bathed in tears, he laments the mi&s;eries of
human race, of his country, of his friends, and un|able
to give &s;uccour, can only relieve them by com|pa&s;&s;ion;
he yet rejoices in the generous di&s;po&s;ition,
and feels a &s;atisfaction &s;uperior to that of the mo&s;t in|dulged
&s;en&s;e. So engaging are the &s;entiments of hu|manity,
that they brighten up the very face of &s;orrow,
and operate like the &s;un, which, &s;hining on a du&s;ky
cloud or falling rain, paints on them the mo&s;t glo|rious

<P>BUT 'tis not here alone, that the &s;ocial virtues di&s;|play
their energy. With whatever ingredient you
mix them, they are &s;till predominant. As &s;orrow can|not
overcome them, &s;o neither can &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure
ob&s;cure them. The joys of love, however tumult|uous,
bani&s;h not the tender &s;entiments of &s;ympathy
and affection. They even derive their chief influence
from that generous pa&s;&s;ion; and when pre&s;ented alone,
afford nothing to the unhappy mind but la&s;&s;itude and
di&s;gu&s;t. Behold this &s;prightly debauchee, who pro|fe&s;&s;es
a contempt of all other plea&s;ures but tho&s;e of
wine and jollity: Separate him from his companions,
like a &s;park from a fire, where before it contributed
to the general blaze: His alacrity &s;uddenly extingui&s;h|es;
and tho' &s;urrounded with every other means of
delight, he lothes the &s;umptuous banquet, and pre&s;ers
<PB N="252" REF="247">
even the mo&s;t ab&s;tracted &s;tudy and &s;peculation, as
more agreeable and entertaining.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions never afford &s;uch tran&s;port|ing
plea&s;ures, or make &s;o glorious an appearance in
the eyes both of GOD and man, as when, &s;haking
off every earthly mixture, they a&s;&s;ociate them&s;elves
with the &s;entiments of virtue, and prompt us to lau|dable
and worthy actions. As harmonious colours
mutually give and receive a lu&s;tre by their friendly
union; &s;o do the&s;e ennobling &s;entiments of the hu|man
mind. See the triumph of nature in parental
affection! What &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion; what &s;en&s;ual delight
is a match for it! Whether a man exults in the pro|&s;perity
and virtue of his offspring, or flies to their
&s;uccour, thro' the mo&s;t threatening and tremendous
dangers?</P>
<P>PROCEED &s;till in purifying the generous pa&s;&s;ion,
you will &s;till the more admire its &s;hining glories.
What charms are there in the harmony of minds, and
in a friend&s;hip founded on mutual e&s;teem and gratitude!
What &s;atisfaction in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, in
comforting the afflicted, in rai&s;ing the fallen, and in
&s;topping the career of cruel fortune, or of more cruel
man, in their in&s;ults over the good and virtuous!
But what &s;upreme joy in the victories over vice as
well as mi&s;ery, when, by virtuous example or wife
exhortation, our fellow-creatures are taught to govern
<PB N="253" REF="248">
their pa&s;&s;ions, reform their vices, and &s;ubdue their
wor&s;t enemies, which inhabit within their own bo|&s;oms?</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e objects are &s;till too limited for the hu|man
mind, which, being of cele&s;tial origin, &s;wells
with the divine&s;t and mo&s;t enlarged affections, and
carrying its attention beyond kindred and acquaint|ance,
extends its benevolent wi&s;hes to the mo&s;t di&s;|tant
po&s;terity. It views liberty and laws as the &s;ource
of human happine&s;s, and devotes it&s;elf, with the ut|mo&s;t
alacrity, to their guardian&s;hip and protection.
Toils, dangers, death it&s;elf carry their charms, when
we brave them for the public good, and ennoble that
being, which we generou&s;ly &s;acrifice for the intere&s;ts
of our country. Happy the man, whom indulgent
fortune allows to pay to virtue what he owes to na|ture,
and to make a generous gift of what mu&s;t other|wi&s;e

<P>IN the true &s;age and patriot are united whatever

is the re&s;ult of our own reflection and indu&s;try?</P>
<P><HI>BUT where is the reward of virtue? And what

to human weakne&s;s, and has not left this fa|vourite
child naked and unendowed. She has pro|vided
virtue of the riche&s;t dowry; but being careful,
left the allurements of intere&s;t &s;hould engage &s;uch

GLORY is the portion of virtue, the &s;weet reward of
honourable toils, the triumphant crown, which co|vers
the thoughtful head of the di&s;intere&s;ted patriot,
or the du&s;ty brow of the victorious warrior. Elevated
by &s;o &s;ublime a prize, the man of virtue looks down
with contempt on all the allurements of plea&s;ure, and
all the menaces of danger. Death it&s;elf lo&s;es its ter|rors,

when he con&s;iders, that its dominion extends
only over a part of him, and that, in &s;pite of death
and time, the rage of the elements, and the endle&s;s
vici&s;&s;itude of human affairs, he is a&s;&s;ured of an im|mortal
fame among all the &s;ons of men.</P>
<P>THERE &s;urely is a being who pre&s;ides over the

has reduced the jarring elements into ju&s;t order and

far this beneficent being extends his care, and whe|ther
he prolongs our exi&s;tence beyond the grave, in
order to be&s;tow on virtue its ju&s;t reward, and render it
fully triumphant. The man of morals, without de|ciding
any thing on &s;o dubious a &s;ubject, is &s;atisfied
with that portion which is marked out to him by the
&s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all things. Gratefully he accepts
of that farther reward prepared for him; but if di&s;ap|pointed,
he thinks not virtue an empty name; but
ju&s;tly e&s;teeming it it's own reward, he gratefully
acknowleges the bounty of his creator, who by call|ing
him forth into exi&s;tence, has thereby afforded
him an opportunity of once acquiring &s;o invaluable a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The PLATONIST<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Or, the man of contemplation, and <HI>philo&s;phical</HI> devotion.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>TO &s;ome philo&s;ophers it appears matter of &s;ur|prize,
that all mankind, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;ame
nature, and being endowed with the &s;ame faculties,
&s;hould yet differ &s;o widely in their pur&s;uits and incli|nations,
and that one &s;hould utterly condemn what is
fondly &s;ought after by another. To &s;ome it appears
matter of &s;till more &s;urprize, that a man &s;hould differ &s;o
widely from him&s;elf at different times; and, after
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, reject with di&s;dain what, before, was the
object of all his vows and wi&s;hes. To me this feveri&s;h
uncertainty and irre&s;olution, in human conduct, &s;eems
altogether unavoidable; nor can a rational &s;oul, made
for the contemplation of the &s;upreme being, and of
his works, ever enjoy tranquillity or &s;atisfaction, while
detained in the ignoble pur&s;uits of &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure or
popular applau&s;e. The divinity is a boundle&s;s ocean
of bli&s;s and glory: Human minds are &s;maller &s;treams,
which ari&s;ing at fir&s;t from this ocean, &s;eek &s;till, amid
<PB N="258" REF="252">
all their wanderings, to return to it, and to lo&s;e them|&s;elves
in that immen&s;ity of perfection. When check|ed
in this natural courte, by vice or folly&punc; they be|come
furious and enraged; and, &s;welling to a tor|rent,
do then &s;pread horror and deva&s;tation on the
neighbouring plains.</P>
<P>IN vain, by pompous phra&s;e and pa&s;&s;ionate ex|pre&s;&s;ion,
each recommends his own pur&s;uit, and in|vites
the credulous hearers to an imitation of his life
and manners. The heart belies the countenance,
and &s;en&s;ibly feels, even amid the highe&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, the
un&s;atisfactory nature of all tho&s;e plea&s;ures, which de|tain
it from its true object. I examine the volup|tuo$s
man before enjoyment; I mea&s;ure the vehe|mence
of his de&s;ire, and the importance of his object;
I find that all his happine&s;s proceeds only from that
hurry of thought which takes him from him&s;elf, and
turns his view from his guilt and mi&s;ery. I con&s;ider
him a moment after; he has now enjoyed the plea|&s;ure,
which he fondly &s;ought after. The &s;en&s;e of
his guilt and mi&s;ery returns upon him with double
angui&s;h: His mind tormented with fear and remor&s;e;
his body depre&s;&s;ed with di&s;gu&s;t and &s;atiety.</P>
<P>BUT a more augu&s;t, at lea&s;t a more haughty per|&s;onage,
pre&s;ents him&s;elf boldly to our cen&s;ure; and
a&s;&s;uming the title of a philo&s;opher and man of mo|rals&punc;
offers to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t rigid examination.
<PB N="259" REF="253">
He challenges with a vi&s;ible, tho' concealed impa|tience,
our approbation and applau&s;e; and &s;eems of|fended,
that we &s;hould he&s;itate a moment before we
break out into admiration of his virtue. Seeing this
impatience, I he&s;itate &s;till more: I begin to examine
the motives of his &s;eeming virtue: But behold! ere
I can enter upon this inquiry, he flings him&s;elf from
me; and addre&s;&s;ing his di&s;cour&s;e to that crowd of
heedle&s;s auditors, fondly abu&s;es them by his magni|ficent
preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>O PHILOSOPHER! thy wi&s;dom is vain, and thy
virtue unprofitable. Thou &s;eeke&s;t the ignorant ap|plau&s;es
of men, not the &s;olid reflections of thy own
con&s;cience, or the more &s;olid approabation of that be|ing,
who, with one regard of his all-&s;eeing eye, pe|netrates
the univer&s;e. Thou &s;urely art con&s;cious of
the hollowne&s;s of thy pretended probity, whil&s;t call|ing
thy&s;elf a citizen, a &s;on, a friend, thou forgette&s;t
thy higher &s;overeign, thy true father, thy greate&s;t be|nefactor.
Where is the adoration due to &s;uch infinite
perfection, whence every thing good and valuable is
derived? Where is the gratitude, owing to thy cre|ator,
who called thee forth from nothing, who placed
thee in all the&s;e relations to thy fellow-creatures, and
requiring thee to fulfil the duty of each relation, for|bids
thee to neglect what thou owe&s;t to him&s;elf, the
mo&s;t perfect being, to whom thou art connected by
the clo&s;e&s;t tye?</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="254">
BUT thou art thy&s;elf thy own idol: Thou wor&s;hip|pe&s;t
thy <HI>imaginary</HI> perfections: Or rather, &s;en&s;ible of
thy <HI>real</HI> imperfections, thou &s;eeke&s;t only to deceive
the world, and to plea&s;e thy fancy, by multiplying
thy ignorant admirers. Thus, not contented with ne|glecting
what is mo&s;t excellent in the univer&s;e, thou de|&s;ire&s;t
to &s;ub&s;titute in his place what is mo&s;t vile and
contemptible.</P>
<P>CONSIDER all the works of mens hands; all the
inventions of human wit, in which thou affecte&s;t &s;o
nice a di&s;cernment: Thou wilt find, that the mo&s;t
perfect production &s;till proceeds from the mo&s;t perfect
thought, and that 'tis MIND alone, which we admire,
while we be&s;tow our applau&s;e on the graces of a well
proportioned &s;tatue, or the &s;ymmetry of a noble pile.
The &s;tatuary, the architect comes &s;till in view, and
makes us reflect on the beauty of his art and contri|vance,
which, from a heap of unformed matter, could
extract &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions and proportions. This &s;upe|rior
beauty of thought and intelligence thou thy&s;elf
acknowlege&s;t, while thou invite&s;t us to contemplate,
in thy conduct, the harmony of affections, the dignity
of &s;entiments, and all tho&s;e graces of a mind, which
chiefly merit our attention. But why &s;toppe&s;t thou
&s;$ort? See&s;t thou nothing farther that is valuable?
Amid thy rapturous applau&s;es of beauty and order,
art thou &s;till ignorant where is to be found the mo&s;t
con&s;ummate beauty? the mo&s;t perfect order? Com|pare
<PB N="261" REF="255">
the works of art with tho&s;e of nature. The one
are but imitations of the other. The nearer art ap|proaches
to nature, the more perfect is it e&s;teemed.
But &s;till, how wide are its neare&s;t approaches, and
what an immen&s;e interval may be ob&s;erved between
them? Art copies only the out&s;ide of nature, leaving
the inward and more admirable &s;prings and principles;
as exceeding her imitation; as beyond her compre|hen&s;ion.
Art copies only the minute productions of
nature, de&s;pairing to reach that grandeur and magni|ficence,
which are &s;o a&s;toni&s;hing in the ma&s;terly
works of her original. Can we then be &s;o blind, as
not to di&s;cover an intelligence and a de&s;ign in the ex|qui&s;ite
and mo&s;t &s;tupendous contrivance of the uni|ver&s;e?
Can we be &s;o &s;tupid, as not to feel the warme&s;t
raptures of wor&s;hip and adoration, upon the contem|plation
of that intelligent being, &s;o infinitely good and
wife?</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t perfect happine&s;s, &s;urely, mu&s;t ari&s;e
from the contemplation of the mo&s;t perfect object.
But what more perfect than beauty and virtue? And
where is beauty to be found equal to that of the uni|ver&s;e?
Or virtue, which can be compared to the be|nevolence
and ju&s;tice of the deity? If aught can
dimini&s;h the plea&s;ure of this contemplation, it mu&s;t be
either the narrowne&s;s of our faculties, which conceals
from us the greate&s;t part of the&s;e beauties and per|fections;
or the &s;hortne&s;s of our lives, which allows

not time &s;ufficient to in&s;truct us in them. But 'tis our
comfort, that if we employ worthily the faculties here

<HEAD>ESSAY XXI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The SCEPTIC.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE long entertained a great &s;u&s;picion, with
regard to the deci&s;ions of philo&s;ophers upon all
&s;ubjects, and found in my&s;elf a greater inclination to
di&s;pute, than a&s;&s;ent to their conclu&s;ions. There is
one mi&s;take, to which they &s;eem liable, almo&s;t without
exception; they con&s;ine too much their principles, and
make no account of that va&s;t variety, which nature
has &s;o much affected in all her operations. When a
philo&s;opher has once laid hold of a favourite prin|ciple,
which perhaps accounts for many natural effects,
he will extend the &s;ame principle over the whole cre|ation,
and reduce to it every phaenomenon, tho' by
the mo&s;t violent and ab&s;urd rea&s;oning. Our own
mind being narrow and contracted, we cannot ex|tend
our conception to the variety and extent of na|ture;
but imagine, that &s;he is as much bounded in
her operations, as we are in our &s;peculations.</P>
<P>BUT if ever this infirmity of philo&s;ophers is to be
&s;u&s;pected on any occa&s;ion, 'tis in their rea&s;onings con|cerning
<PB N="264" REF="258">
human life, and the methods of attaining
happine&s;s. In that ca&s;e, they are led a&s;tray, not
only by the narrowne&s;s of their under&s;tandings, but
al&s;o by that of their pa&s;&s;ions. Almo&s;t every one has
a predominant inclination, to which all his other de|&s;ires
and affections &s;ubmit, and which governs him,
tho', perhaps, with &s;ome intervals, thro' the whole
cour&s;e of his life. 'Tis difficult for him to apprehend,
that any thing, which appears totally indifferent to
him, can ever give enjoyment to any per&s;on, or can
po&s;&s;e&s;s charms, which altogether e&s;cape his ob&s;erva|tion.
His own pur&s;uits are always, in his account,
the mo&s;t engaging: The objects of his pa&s;&s;ion, the
mo&s;t valuable: And the road which he pur&s;ues, the
only one that leads to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT would the&s;e prejudiced rea&s;oners reflect a
moment, there are many obvious in&s;tances and argu|ments,
&s;ufficient to undeceive them, and make them
enlarge their maxims and principles. Do they not
&s;ee the va&s;t variety of inclinations and pur&s;uits among
our &s;pecies, where each man &s;eems fully &s;atisfied with
his own cour&s;e of life, and would e&s;teem it the great|e&s;t
unhappine&s;s to be confined to that of his neigh|bour?
Do they not feel in them&s;elves, that what
plea&s;es at one time, di&s;plea&s;es at another, by the
change of inclination; and that it is not in their
power, by their utmo&s;t efforts, to recall that ta&s;te or
appetite, which formerly be&s;towed charms on what
<PB N="265" REF="259">
now appears indifferent or di&s;agreeable? What is the
meaning therefore of tho&s;e general preferences of the
town or country life, of a life of action or one of
plea&s;ure, of retirement or &s;ociety; when, be&s;ides the
different inclinations of different men, every one's ex|perience
may convince him, that each of the&s;e kinds
of life is agreeable in its turn, and that their variety
or their judicious mixture chiefly contributes to the
rendering all of them agreeable.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hall this bu&s;ine&s;s be allowed to go altogether
at adventures? And mu&s;t a man con&s;ult only his hu|mour
and inclination, in order to determine his cour&s;e
of life, without ever employing his rea&s;on to inform
him what road is preferable, and leads mo&s;t &s;urely to
happine&s;s? Is there no difference then between one
man's conduct and another?</P>
<P>I ANSWER, There is a great difference. One man,
following his inclinations, in chu&s;ing his cour&s;e of life,
may employ much &s;urer means for &s;ucceeding than
another, who is led by his inclination into the &s;ame
cour&s;e of life, and pur&s;ues the &s;ame object. <HI>Are
riches the chief object of your de&s;ires?</HI> Acquire &s;kill in

into either of the extremes, you either provoke men's
pride by your in&s;olence, or teach them to de&s;pi&s;e you
by your timorous &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and by the mean opi|nion
which you &s;eem to entertain of your&s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE, you &s;ay, are the maxims of common pru|dence

<P>I AM &s;orry, then, I have pretended to be a philo|&s;opher:

deliver my opinion upon the matter, and only de|&s;ire
you to e&s;teem it of as little con&s;equence as I do
my&s;elf. By that means you will neither think it
worthy of your ridicule nor your anger.</P>
<P>IF we can depend upon any principle, which we

beautiful or deformed; but that the&s;e attributes ari&s;e
from the particular con&s;titution and fabric of human
&s;entiments and affections. What &s;eems the mo&s;t deli|cious
food to one animal, appears loath&s;ome to ano|ther:
What affects the feeling of one with delight,
produces unea&s;ine&s;s to another. This is confe&s;&s;edly
the ca&s;e with regard to all the bodily &s;en&s;es: But if
we examine the matter more accurately, we &s;hall find
that the &s;ame ob&s;ervation holds even where the mind
concurs with the body, and mingles its &s;entiments
with the exterior appetites.</P>
<P>DESIRE this pa&s;&s;ionate lover to give you a character

nothing&punc; however, from all this di&s;cour&s;e, but
that the poor man is in love; and that the general
appetite between the &s;exes, which nature has infu&s;ed
into all animals, is in him determined to a particular
object by &s;ome qualities, which give him plea&s;ure.
The &s;ame divine creature, not only to a different ani|mal,
but al&s;o to a different man, appears a mere
mortal being, and is beheld with the utmo&s;t indif|ference.</P>
<P>NATURE has given all animals a like prejudice in
favour of their offspring. As &s;oon as the helple&s;s in|fant
&s;ees the light, tho' in every other eye it appears
a de&s;picable and a mi&s;erable creature, it is regarded by
its fond parent with the utmo&s;t affection, and is pre|ferred
to every other object, however perfect or ac|compli&s;hed.
The pa&s;&s;ion alone, ari&s;ing from the ori|ginal
&s;tructure and formation of human nature, be|&s;tows
a value on the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant object.</P>
<P>WE may pu&s;h the &s;ame ob&s;ervation further, and
may conclude, that even when the mind operates
alone, and feeling the &s;entiments of blame or appro|bation,
pronounces one object deformed and odious,
another beautiful and amiable; I &s;ay, that even in
this ca&s;e, the&s;e qualities are not really in the objects,
<PB N="269" REF="263">
but belong entirely to the &s;entiments of that mind
which blames or prai&s;es. I grant, that it will be
more difficult to make this propo&s;ition evident, and
as it were, palpable, to negligent thinkers, becau&s;e
nature is more uniform in the &s;entiments of the mind
than in mo&s;t feelings of the body, and produces a
nearer re&s;emblance in the inward than in the outward
part of human kind. There is &s;omething approach|ing
to principles in mental ta&s;te; and critics can rea|&s;on
and di&s;pute much more plau&s;ibly than cooks or
perfumers. We may ob&s;erve, however, That this
uniformity among human kind, hinders not, but that
there is a con&s;iderable diver&s;ity in the &s;entiments of
beauty and worth, and that education, cu&s;tom, pre|judice,
caprice, and humour frequently vary our ta&s;te
of this kind. You will never convince a man, who
is not accu&s;tomed to ITALIAN mu&s;ic, and has not an
ear to follow its intricacies, that a SCOTCH tune is
not preferable. You have not even any &s;ingle argu|ment,
beyond your own ta&s;te, which you can employ
in your behalf: And to your antagoni&s;t, his particu|lar
ta&s;te will always appear a much more convincing
argument to the contrary. If you be wi&s;e, each of
you will allow, that the other may be in the right;
and having many other in&s;tances of this diver&s;ity of
ta&s;te, you will both confe&s;s, that beauty and worth
are merely of a relative nature, and con&s;i&s;t in an
agreeable &s;entiment, produced by an object on a par|ticular
<PB N="270" REF="264">
mind, according to the peculiar &s;tructure and
con&s;titution of that mind.</P>
<P>BY this diver&s;ity of &s;entiment, ob&s;ervable in human
kind, nature has, perhaps, intended to make us &s;en|&s;ible
of her authority, and let us &s;ee what &s;urprizing
changes &s;he could produce on the pa&s;&s;ions and de|&s;ires
of mankind, merely by the change of their in|ward
fabric, without any alteration on the objects.
The vulgar may even be convinced by this argument:
But men accu&s;tomed to thinking may draw a more
convincing, at lea&s;t a more general argument, from
the very nature of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IN the operation of rea&s;oning, the mind does no|thing
but run over its objects, as they are &s;uppo&s;ed
to &s;tand in reality, without adding any thing to them,
or dimini&s;hing any thing from them. If I examine
the PTOLOMAIC and COPERNICAN &s;y&s;tems, I endea|vour
only, by my enquiries, to know the real &s;itua|tion
of the planets; that is, in other words, I endea|vour
to give them, in my mind or conception, the
&s;ame relations which they bear towards each other in
the heavens. To this operation of the mind, there|fore,
there &s;eem$ to be always a real, tho' often an
unknown &s;tandard, in the nature of things; nor is truth
or fal&s;hood variable by the various apprehen&s;ions of
mankind. Tho' all human race &s;hould for ever con|clude,
that the &s;un moves, and the earth remains at
<PB N="271" REF="265">
re&s;t, the &s;un &s;tirs not an inch from his place for all
the&s;e rea&s;onings; and &s;uch conclu&s;ions are eternally
fal&s;e and erroneous.</P>
<P>BUT the ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with the qualities of
<HI>beautiful and deformed, de&s;irable and odious,</HI> as with
truth and fal&s;hood. In the former ca&s;e, the mind is
not contented with merely &s;urveying its objects, as
they &s;tand in them&s;elves: It al&s;o feels a &s;entiment of
delight or unea&s;ine&s;s, approbation or blame, con&s;e|quent
to that &s;urvey: and this &s;entiment determines
it to pronounce the object <HI>beautiful or deformed, de|&s;irable
or odious.</HI> Now, 'tis evident, that this &s;enti|ment
mu&s;t depend upon the particular fabric or &s;truc|ture
of the mind, which enables &s;uch particular ob|jects
to operate in &s;uch a particular manner, and pro|duces
a &s;ympathy or conformity between the mind
and the objects. Vary the &s;tructure of the mind or
inward organs, the &s;entiment no $onger follows, the'
the objects remain the &s;ame. The &s;entiment being
different from the object, and ari&s;ing from its opera|tion
upon the organs of the mind, an alteration upon
the latter mu&s;t vary the effect, nor can the &s;ame ob|ject,
pre&s;ented to a mind totally different, produce the
&s;ame &s;entiment.</P>
<P>THIS conclu&s;ion every one is apt to form of him|&s;elf,
without much philo&s;ophy, where the &s;entiment
is evidently di&s;tingui&s;hable from the object. Who is
<PB N="272" REF="266">
not &s;en&s;ible, that power, and glory, and vengeance, are
not de&s;irable of them&s;elves, but derive all their value
from the &s;tructure of human pa&s;&s;ions, which begets a
de&s;ire towards &s;uch particular objects? But with re|gard
to beauty, either natural or moral, the ca&s;e is
commonly &s;uppo&s;ed to be different. The agreeable
quality is thought to lie in the object, not in the &s;en|timent;
and that merely becau&s;e the &s;entiment is not
&s;o turbulent and violent as to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf, in an
evident manner, from the perception of the object.</P>
<P>BUT a very little reflection &s;uffices to di&s;tingui&s;h
them. A man may know exactly all the circles and
ellip&s;es of the COPERNICAN &s;y&s;tem, and all the irre|gular
&s;pirals of the PTOLOMAIC, without perceiving
that the former is more beautiful than the latter.
EUCLID has very fully explained every quality of the
circle, but has not, in any propo&s;ition, &s;aid a word
of its beauty. The rea&s;on is evident. Beauty is not
a quality of the circle. It lies not in any part of the
line <HI>who&s;e</HI> parts are all equally di&s;tant from a com|mon
centre. It is only the effect, which that figure
operates upon the mind, who&s;e particular fabric or
&s;tructure renders it &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch &s;entiments. In
vain would you look for it in the circle, or &s;eek i$
either by your &s;en&s;es, or by mathematical rea&s;onings,
in all the properties of that figure.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="267">
THE mathematician, who took no other plea&s;ure
in reading Virgil, but that of examining ENEAS'S
voyage by the map, might under&s;tand perfectly the
meaning of every Latin word, imployed by that di|vine
author; and con&s;equently, might have a di&s;tinct
idea of the whole narration. He would even have
a more di&s;tinct idea of it, than they could have who
had not &s;tudied &s;o exactly the geography of the poem.
He knew, therefore, every thing in the poem: But
he was ignorant of its beauty; becau&s;e the beauty,
properly &s;peaking, lies not in the poem, but in the
&s;entiment or ta&s;te of the reader. And where a man
has no &s;uch delicacy of temper, as to make him feel
this &s;entiment, he mu&s;t be ignorant of the beauty,
tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;cience and under&s;tanding of an
angel<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">WERE I not afraid of appearing too philo&s;ophical, I &s;hould remind my reader of that famous doctrine, &s;uppo&s;ed to be fully proved in modern times, &startq;That ta&s;tes and colours, and all other &s;en&s;ible qualities, lie not in the bodies, but merely in the &s;en&s;es.&endq; The ca&s;e is the &s;ame with beauty and deformity, virtue and vice. This doctrine, however, takes off no more from the reality of the latter qualities, than from that of the former; nor need it give any umbrag$ either to critics or mora|li&s;ts. Tho' colours were allowed to lie only in the eye, would dyers or painters ever be le&s;s regarded or e&s;teemed? There is a &s;ufficient uniformity in the &s;en&s;es and feelings of mankind, to make all the&s;e qualities the objects of art and rea&s;oning, and to have the greate&s;t influence on life and manners. And as 'tis certain, that the di&s;covery above-mentioned in natural philo&s;ophy, makes no alteration on action and conduct; why &s;hould a like di&s;covery in moral philo&s;ophy make any alteration?</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="274" REF="268">
THE inference upon the whole is, that it is not
from the value or worth of the object, which any
per&s;on pur&s;ues, that we can determine his enjoyment,
but merely from the pa&s;&s;ion with which he pur&s;ues it,
and the &s;ucce&s;s which he meets with in his pur&s;uit.
Objects have ab&s;olutely no worth or value in them|&s;elves.
They derive their worth merely from the
pa&s;&s;ion. If that be &s;trong, and &s;teady, and &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful,
the per&s;on is happy. It cannot rea&s;onably be
doubted, but a little mi&s;s, dre&s;t in a new gown for a
dancing-&s;chool ball, receives as compleat enjoyment
as the greate&s;t orator, who triumphs in the &s;plendor
of his eloquence, while he governs the pa&s;&s;ions and
re&s;olutions of a numerous a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>ALL the difference, therefore, betwixt one man
and another, with regard to life, con&s;i&s;ts either in the
<HI>pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> or in the <HI>enjoyment:</HI> And the&s;e differences are
&s;ufficient to produce the wide extremes of happine&s;s
and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>To be happy, the <HI>pa&s;&s;ion</HI> mu&s;t neither be too violent
nor too remi&s;s. In the fir&s;t ca&s;e, the mind is in a
perpetural hurry and tumult; in the &s;econd, it &s;inks
into a di&s;agreeable indolence and lethargy.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="269">
To be happy, the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be benign and &s;ocial;
not rough or fierce. The affections of the latter kind
are not near &s;o agreeable, to the feeling, as tho&s;e of
the former. Who will compare rancour and animo|&s;ity,
envy and revenge, to friend&s;hip, benignity, cle|mency
and gratitude?</P>
<P>To be happy, the pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t be chearful and gay,
not gloomy and melancholy. A propen&s;ity to hope
and joy is real riches: One to fear and &s;orrow, real
poverty.</P>
<P>SOME pa&s;&s;ions or inclinations, in the <HI>enjoyment</HI> of
their object, are not &s;o &s;teady or con&s;tant as others,
nor convey &s;uch durable plea&s;ure and &s;atisfaction.
<HI>Philo&s;ophical devotion,</HI> for in&s;tance, like the enthu&s;i|a&s;m
of a poet, is the tran&s;itory effect of high &s;pirits,
great lei&s;ure, a fine genius, and a habit of &s;tudy and
contemplation: But notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
an ab&s;tracted, invi&s;ible object, like that which
<HI>natural</HI> religion alone pre&s;ents to us, cannot long ac|tuate
the mind, or be of any moment in life. To
render the pa&s;&s;ion of continuance, we mu&s;t find &s;ome
method of affecting the &s;en&s;es and imagination, and
mu&s;t embrace &s;ome <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> as well as <HI>philo&s;ophical</HI>
accounts of the divinity. Popular &s;uper&s;tition and
ob&s;ervances are even found to be of u&s;e in this par|ticular.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="270">
THO' the tempers of men be very different, yet we
may &s;afely pronounce in general, that a life of plea|&s;ure
cannot &s;upport it&s;elf &s;o long as one of bu&s;ine&s;s,
but is much more &s;ubject to &s;atiety and di&s;gu&s;t. The
amu&s;ements, which are the mo&s;t durable, have all a
mixture of application and attention in them; &s;uch as
gaming and hunting. And in general, bu&s;ine&s;s and
action fill up all the great vacancies of human life.</P>
<P>BUT where the temper is the be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed for any
<HI>enjoyment,</HI> the object is often wanting: And in this
re&s;pect, the pa&s;&s;ions, which pur&s;ue <HI>external</HI> objects,
contribute not &s;o much to happine&s;s, as tho&s;e which
re&s;t in our&s;elves; &s;ince we are neither &s;o certain of at|taining
&s;uch objects, nor &s;o &s;ecure of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing them.
A pa&s;&s;ion for learning is pre&s;erable, with regard to
happine&s;s, to one for riches.</P>
<P>SOME men are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great &s;trength of mind;
and even when they pur&s;ue <HI>external</HI> objects, are not
much affected by a di&s;appointment, but renew their
application and indu&s;try with the greate&s;t chearful|ne&s;s.
Nothing contributes more to happine&s;s than
this turn of mind.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to this &s;hort and imperfect &s;ketch of
human life, the happie&s;t di&s;po&s;ition of mind is the
<HI>virtuous;</HI> or, in other words, that which leads to ac|tion-and
employment, renders us &s;en&s;ible to the &s;o|cial
<PB N="277" REF="271">
pa&s;&s;ions, &s;teels the heart again&s;t the a&s;&s;aults of for|tune,
reduces the affections to a ju&s;t moderation,
makes our own thoughts an entertainment to us, and
inclines us rather to the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety and con|ver&s;ation,
than to tho&s;e of the &s;en&s;es. This, in the
mean time, mu&s;t be obvious to the mo&s;t carele&s;s rea|&s;oner,
that all di&s;po&s;itions of mind are not alike fa|vourable
to happine&s;s, and that one pa&s;&s;ion or humour
may be extremely de&s;irable, while another is equally
di&s;agreeable. And indeed, all the difference between
the conditions of life depends upon the mind; nor is
there any one &s;ituation of affairs, in it&s;elf, preferable
to another. Good and ill, both natural and moral,
are entirely relative to human &s;entiment and affec|tion.
No man would ever be unhappy, could he al|ter
his feelings. PROTEUS-like, he would elude all
attacks, by the continual alterations of his &s;hape and
form.</P>
<P>BUT of this re&s;ource nature has, in a great mea|&s;ure,
deprived us. The fabric and con&s;titution of our
mind no more depends on our choice, than that of our
body. The generality of men have not even the
&s;malle&s;t notion, that any alteration in this re&s;pect can
ever be de&s;irable. As a &s;tream nece&s;&s;arily follows
the &s;everal inclinations of the ground, on which it
runs; &s;o are the ignorant and thoughtle&s;s part of
mankind actuated by their natural propen&s;ities. Such
are effectually excluded from all preten&s;ions to phi|lo&s;ophy,
<PB N="278" REF="272">
and the <HI>medicine of the mind,</HI> &s;o much boa&s;ted.
But even upon the wi&s;e and thoughtful, nature has a
prodigious influence; nor is it always in a man's
power, by the utmo&s;t art and indu&s;try, to correct his
temper, and attain that virtuous character, to which he
a&s;pires. The empire of philo&s;ophy extends over a
few: and with regard to the&s;e too, her authority is
very weak and limited. Men may well be &s;en&s;ible of
the value of virtue, and may de&s;ire to attain it; but
'tis not always certain, that they will be &s;ucce&s;sful in
their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>WHOEVER con&s;iders, without prejudice, the cour&s;e
of human actions, will find, that mankind are almo&s;t
entirely guided by con&s;titution and temper, and that
general maxims have little influence, but &s;o far as they
affect our ta&s;te or &s;entiment. If a man have a lively
&s;en&s;e of honour and virtue, with moderate pa&s;&s;ions,
his conduct will always be conformable to the rules of
morality; or if he depart from them, his return will
be ea&s;y and expeditious. But on the other hand,
where one is born of &s;o perver&s;e a frame of mind, of
&s;o callous and in&s;en&s;ible a di&s;po&s;ition, as to have no
reli&s;h for virtue and humanity, no &s;ympathy with his
fellow-creatures, no de&s;ire of e&s;teem and applau&s;e;
&s;uch a one mu&s;t be allowed entirely incurable, nor is
there any remedy in philo&s;ophy. He reaps no &s;ati&s;|faction
but from low and &s;en&s;ual objects, or from the
indulgence of malignant pa&s;&s;ions: He feels no remor&s;e
<PB N="279" REF="273">
to controul his vicious inclinations: He has not even
that &s;en&s;e or ta&s;te, which is requi&s;ite to make him de|&s;ire
a better character: For my part, I know not how
I &s;hould addre&s;s my&s;elf to &s;uch a one, or by what ar|guments
I &s;hould endeavour to reform him. Should
I tell him of the inward &s;atisfaction which re&s;ults from
laudable and humane actions, the delicate plea&s;ures of
di&s;intere&s;ted love and friend&s;hip, the la&s;ting enjoy|ments
of a good name and an e&s;tabli&s;hed character,
he might &s;till reply, that the&s;e were, perhaps, plea|&s;ures
to &s;uch as were &s;u&s;ceptible to them; but that,
for his part, he finds him&s;elf of a quite different turn
and di&s;po&s;ition. I mu&s;t repeat it; my philo&s;ophy af|fords
no remedy in &s;uch a ca&s;e, nor could I do any
thing but lament this per&s;on's unhappy condition.
But then I a&s;k, If any other philo&s;ophy can afford a
remedy; or if it be po&s;&s;ible, by any &s;y&s;tem, to render
all mankind virtuous, however perver&s;e may be their
natural frame of mind? Experience will &s;oon convince
us of the contrary; and I will venture to affirm, that
perhaps, the chief benefit, which re&s;ults from philo|&s;ophy,
ari&s;es in an indirect manner, and proceeds
more from its &s;ecret, in&s;en&s;ible influence, than from
its immediate application.</P>
<P>'TIS certain, that a &s;erious attention to the &s;ci|ences
and liberal arts, &s;oftens and humanizes the
temper, and cheri&s;hes tho&s;e fine emotions, in which
true virtue and honor con&s;i&s;ts. It rarely, very rarely
<PB N="280" REF="274">
happens, that a man of ta&s;te and learning is not, at
lea&s;t, an hone&s;t man, whatever frailties may attend
him. The bent of his mind to &s;peculative &s;tudies
mu&s;t mortify in him the pa&s;&s;ions of intere&s;t and ambi|tion,
and mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, give him a greater
&s;en&s;ibility of all the decencies and duties of life. He
feels more fully a moral di&s;tinction in characters and
manners, nor is his &s;en&s;e of this kind dimini&s;hed, but,
on the contrary, it is much encrea&s;ed, by his &s;pecu|lations.</P>
<P>BESIDES &s;uch in&s;en&s;ible changes upon the temper
and di&s;po&s;ition, 'tis highly probable, that others may
be produced by &s;tudy and application. The prodi|gious
effects of education may convince us, that the
mind is not altogether &s;tubborn and inflexible, but
will admit of many alterations from its original make
and &s;tructure. Let a man propo&s;e to him&s;elf the mo|del
of a character, which he approves of: Let him be
well acquainted with tho&s;e particulars, in which his
own character deviates from this model: Let him
keep a con&s;tant watch over him&s;elf, and bend his
mind, by a continual effort, from the vices, towards
the virtues; and I doubt not but, in time, he will find,
in his temper, an alteration to the better.</P>
<P>HABIT is another powerful means of reforming
the mind, and implanting in it good di&s;po&s;itions
and inclinations. A man who continues in a cour&s;e
<PB N="281" REF="275">
of &s;obriety and temperance, will hate riot and di&s;or|der:
If he engage in bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;tudy, indolence
will &s;eem a puni&s;hment to him: If he con&s;train him|&s;elf
to practi&s;e beneficence and affability, he will &s;oon
abhor all in&s;tances of pride and violence. Where one
is thorowly convinced, that the virtuous cour&s;e of $ife
is preferable; if he has but re&s;olution enough, for
&s;ome time, to impo&s;e a violence on him&s;elf; his re|formation
need not be de&s;paired of. The misfortune
is, that this conviction and this re&s;olution never can
have place, unle&s;s a man be, before-hand, tolerably
virtuous.</P>
<P>HERE then is the chief triumph of art and philo|&s;ophy:
It in&s;en&s;ibly refines the temper, and it points
out to us tho&s;e di&s;po&s;itions which we &s;hould endeavour
to attain, by a con&s;tant <HI>bent</HI> of mind, and by repeated
<HI>habit.</HI> Beyond this I cannot acknowlege it to have
great influence; and I mu&s;t entertain doubts concern|ing
all tho&s;e exhortations and con&s;olations, which are
in &s;uch vogue among all &s;peculative rea&s;oners.</P>
<P>WE have already ob&s;erved, that no objects are, of
them&s;elves, de&s;irable or odious, valuable or de&s;pica|ble;
but that objects acquire the&s;e qualities from the
particular character and con&s;titution of the mind,
which &s;urveys them. To dimini&s;h therefore, or aug|ment
any per&s;on's value for an object, to excite or mo|derate
his pa&s;&s;ions, there are no direct arguments or
<PB N="282" REF="276">
rea&s;ons, which can be employed with any force or
influence. The catching flies, like DOMITIAN, if it
give more plea&s;ure, is preferable to the hunting wild
bea&s;ts, like WILLIAM RU$US, or conquering king|doms,
like ALEXANDER.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the value of every object can be deter|mined
only by the &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions of every in|dividual,
we may ob&s;erve, that the pa&s;&s;ions, in pro|nouncing
their verdict, con&s;ider not the object &s;imply,
as it is in it&s;elf, but &s;urvey it with all the circum|&s;tances,
which attend it. A man tran&s;ported with
joy, on account of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a diamond, confines
not his view to the gli&s;tering &s;$one before him: He
al&s;o con&s;iders its rarity, and from thence chiefly ari&s;es
his plea&s;ure and exultation. Here therefore a philo|&s;opher

either moderate or excite any particular pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT may &s;eem unrea&s;onable ab&s;olutely to deny the

be confe&s;&s;ed, that there lies this &s;trong pre&s;umption
again&s;t it, that if the&s;e views be natural and obvious,
they would have occured of them&s;elves, without the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of philo&s;ophy; if they be not natural, they
never can have any influence on the affections. <HI>The&s;e</HI>
are of a very delicate nature, and cannot be forced
<PB N="283" REF="277">
or con&s;trained by the utmo&s;t art or indu&s;try. A con|&s;ideration,
which we &s;eek for on purpo&s;e, which we
enter into with difficulty, which we retain with care
and attention, can never produce tho&s;e genuine and
durable movements of pa&s;&s;ion, which are the re&s;ult of
nature, and the con&s;titution of the mind. A man
may as well pretend to cure him&s;elf of love, by view|ing
his mi&s;tre&s;s thro' the <HI>artificial</HI> medium of a micro&s;|cope,
or pro&s;pect, and beholding there the coar&s;ene&s;s
of her &s;kin, and mon&s;trous di&s;proportion of her fea|tures,
as hope to excite or moderate any pa&s;&s;ion by
the <HI>artificial</HI> arguments of a SENECA or an EPICTE|TUS.
The remembrance of the natural a&s;pect and
&s;ituation of the objects will, in both ca&s;es, &s;till re|turn
upon him. The reflections of philo&s;ophy are too
&s;ubtile and di&s;tant to take place in common life, or
eradicate any affection. The air is too fine to breathe
in where it is above the winds and clouds of the at|mo&s;phere.</P>
<P>ANOTHER defect of tho&s;e refined reflections, which
philo&s;ophy pre&s;ents to us, is, that commonly they can|not
dimini&s;h or extingui&s;h our vicious pae&s;&s;ions, with|out
dimini&s;hing or extingui&s;hing &s;uch as are virtuous,
and rendering the mind totally indifferent and inac|tive.
They are &s;o the mo&s;t part, general, and are
applicable to all our affections. In vain do we hope
to direct their influence only to one &s;ide. If by in|ce&s;&s;ant
&s;tudy and meditation we have rendered them

<P>'TIS certain, were a &s;uperior being thru&s;t into a
human body, that the whole of life would to him ap|pear
&s;o mean, contemptible and puerile, that he never
could be induced to take part in any thing, and would
&s;carcely give attention to what pa&s;&s;es around him.
To engage him to &s;uch a conde&s;cen&s;ion as to play
even the part of a PHILIP with zeal and alacrity,
would be much more difficult than to con&s;train the
&s;ame PHILIP, after having been a king and a con|queror
during fifty years, to mend old &s;hoes with pro|per
care and attention; the occupation which LU|CIAN
a&s;&s;igns him in the infernal regions. Now all
the &s;ame topics of di&s;dain towards human affairs,
which could operate on this &s;uppo&s;ed being, occur al&s;o
to a philo&s;opher; but being, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, di&s;|proportioned
to human capacity, and not being for|tified
<PB N="288" REF="282">
with the experience of any thing better, they
make not a full impre&s;&s;ion on him. He &s;ees, but he
feels not &s;ufficiently their truth; and is always a &s;u|blime
philo&s;opher, when he needs not; that is, as
long as nothing di&s;turbs him, or rouzes his affections.
While others play, he wonders at their keenne&s;s and
ardour; but he no &s;ooner puts in his own &s;take, than he
is commonly tran&s;ported with the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, which
he had &s;o much condemned while he remained a
&s;imple &s;pectator.</P>
<P>THERE are chiefly two con&s;iderations to be met
with in books of philo&s;ophy, from which any im|portant
effect is to be expected, and that becau&s;e
the&s;e con&s;iderations are drawn from common life,
and occur upon the mo&s;t &s;uperficial view of human
affairs. When we reflect on the &s;hortne&s;s and uncer|tainty
of life, how de&s;picable &s;eem all our pur&s;uits of
happine&s;s? And even, if we would extend our con|cern
beyond our own life, how frivolous appear our
mo&s;t enlarged and mo&s;t generous projects; when we
con&s;ider the ince&s;&s;ant changes and revolutions of hu|man
affairs, by which laws and learning, books and
governments are hurried away by time, as by a rapid
&s;tream, and are lo&s;t in the immen&s;e ocean of matter?
Such a reflection certainly tends to mortify all our pa&s;|&s;ions:
But does it not thereby counterwork the arti|fice
of nature, who has happily deceived us into an
opinion, that human life is of &s;ome importance? And
<PB N="289" REF="283">
may not &s;uch a reflection be employed with &s;ucce&s;s by
voluptuous rea&s;oners, in order to lead us from the
paths of action and virtue, into the flowery fields of
indolence and plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>WE are informed by THUCYDIDES, that, during
the famous plague of ATHENS, when death &s;eemed
pre&s;ent to every one, a di&s;&s;olute mirth and gaiety pre|vailed
among the people, who exhorted one another
to make the mo&s;t of life as long as it endured. The
&s;ame ob&s;ervation is made by BOCCACE with regard to
the plague of FLORENCE. A like principle makes
&s;oldiers, during war, to be more addicted to riot and
expence, than any other race of men. Pre&s;ent plea|&s;ure
is always of importance; and whatever dimi|ni&s;hes
the importance of all other objects mu&s;t be|&s;tow
on it an additional influence and value.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> philo&s;ophical con&s;ideration, which may
often have an influence on the affections, is derived
from a compari&s;on of our own condition with the
condition of others. This compari&s;on we are conti|nually
making, even in common life; but the mi&s;|fortune
is, that we are apt rather to compare our
&s;ituation with that of our &s;uperiors, than with that
of our inferiors. A philo&s;opher corrects this na|tural
infirmity, by turning his view to the other
&s;ide, in order to render him&s;elf ea&s;y in the &s;itu|ation
in which fortune has placed him. There are
few people, who are not &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;ome con&s;ola|tion
<PB N="290" REF="284">
from this reflection, tho' to a very good natured
man, the view of human mi&s;eries &s;hould rather pro|duce
&s;orrow than comfort, and add to his lamenta|tions
for his own misfortunes a deep compa&s;&s;ion for
tho&s;e of others. Such is the imperfection, even of
the be&s;t of the&s;e philo&s;ophical topics of con&s;olation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The &s;ceptic, perhaps, carries the matter too far, when he limits all philo&s;ophical topics and reflections to the&s;e two. There &s;eem to be others, who&s;e truth is undeniable, and who&s;e natural tendency is to tranquilize and &s;often all the pa&s;&s;ions. Philo&s;ophy greedily &s;eizes the&s;e, &s;tudies them, weighs them, commits them to the memory, and familiarizes them to the mind: and their influence on tempers, which are thoughtful, gentle, and mode|rate, may be con&s;iderable. But what is their influence, you will &s;ay, if the temper be antecedently di&s;po&s;ed after the &s;ame man|ner which they pretend to form it? They may, at lea&s;t, fortify that temper, and furni&s;h it with views, by which it may enter|tain and nouri&s;h it&s;elf. Here are a few examples of &s;uch philo|&s;ophical reflections.</P>
<P>1. Is it not certain, that every condition has concealed ills? Then why envy any body?</P>
<P>2. Every one has known ills; and there is a compen&s;ation throughout. Why not be contented with the pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>3. Cu&s;tom deadens the &s;en&s;e both of the good and the ill, and levels every thing.</P>
<P>4. Health and humour all. The re&s;t of little con&s;equence, except the&s;e be affected.</P>
<P>5. How many other goods have I? Then why be vexed for one ill?</P>
<P>6. How many are happy in the condition of which I com|plain? How many envy me?</P>
<P>7. Every good mu&s;t be paid for: Fortune by labour, favour by flattery. Would I keep the price, yet have the commodity?</P>
<P>8. Expect not too great happine&s;s in life. Human nature ad|mits it not.</P>
<P>9. Propo&s;e not a happine&s;s too complicated. But does that depend on me? Yes: The fir&s;t choice does. Life is like a game: One may choo&s;e the game: And pa&s;&s;ion, by degrees, &s;eizes the proper object.</P>
<P>10. Anticipate by your hopes and fancy future con&s;olation, which time infallibly brings to every a$$iction.</P>
<P>11. I de&s;ire to be rich. Why? That I may po&s;&s;e&s;s many fine objects; hou&s;es, gardens, equipage, &amp;c. How many fine ob|jects does nature offer to every one without expence? If enjoyed, &s;ufficient. If not: See the effect of cu&s;tom or of temper, which would &s;oon take off the reli&s;h of the riches.</P>
<P>12. I de&s;ire $ame. Let this occur: If I act well, I &s;hall have the e&s;teem of all my acquaintance. And what is all the re&s;t to me?</P>
<P>The&s;e reflections are &s;o obvious, that 'tis a wonder they oc|cur not to every man: So convincing, that 'tis a wonder they per&s;uade not every man. But perhaps they do occur to and per|&s;uade mo&s;t men; when they con&s;ider human life, by a general and calm &s;urvey: But where any real, affecting incident hap|pens; when pa&s;&s;ion is awakened, fancy agitated, example draws, and coun&s;el urges; the philo&s;opher is lo&s;t in the man, and he &s;earches in vain for that per&s;ua&s;ion, which before &s;eemed &s;o firm and un&s;haken. What remedy for this inconvenience? A&s;&s;i&s;t your&s;elf by a frequent peru&s;al of the entertaining morali&s;ts: Have recour&s;e to the learning of PLUTARCH, the imagination of LUCIAN, the eloquence of CICERO, the wit of SENECA, the gaiety of MONTAIGNE, the &s;ublimity of SHAFTESBURY. Moral precepts, &s;o couched, &s;trike deep, and fortify the mind again&s;t the illu&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion. But tru&s;t not altogether to ex|ternal aid: By habit and &s;tudy acquire that philo&s;ophic temper, which both gives force to reflection, and by rendering a great part of your happine&s;s independent, takes off the edge from all di&s;orderly pa&s;&s;ions, and tranquilizes the mind. De&s;pi&s;e not the&s;e helps; but confide not too much in them neither; unle&s;s nature has been favourable in the temper, with which &s;he has endowed you.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="285">
I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, That
tho' virtue be undoubtedly the be&s;t choice, when it is
<PB N="292" REF="286">
attainable; yet &s;uch is the di&s;order and confu&s;ion of
human affairs, that no perfect oeconomy or regular
di&s;tribution of happine&s;s and mi&s;ery is ever, in this
life, to be expected. Not only the goods of fortune,
and the endowments of the body (both which are of
great importance) not only the&s;e advantages, I &s;ay,
are unequally divided betwixt the virtuous and vici|cus,
but even the mind it&s;elf partakes, in &s;ome de|gree,
of this di&s;order, and the mo&s;t worthy character,
by the very oeconomy of the pa&s;&s;ions, enjoys not al|ways
the highe&s;t felicity.</P>
<P><PB N="293" REF="287">
'Tis ob&s;ervable, that tho' every bodily di&s;ea&s;e or
pain proceeds from &s;ome di&s;order in the parts, yet the
pain is not always proportioned to the di&s;order; but
is greater or le&s;s, according to the greater or le&s;s &s;en|&s;ibility
of the part, upon which the noxious humours
exert their influence. A <HI>tooth-ach</HI> produces more vi|olent
convul&s;ions of pain than a <HI>ph$$&s;is</HI> or a <HI>dro$&s;y.</HI>
In like manner, with regard to the con&s;titution of the
mind, we may ob&s;erve, that all vice is indeed perni|cious;
but yet the di&s;turbance or pain is not mea&s;ured
out by nature with exact proportion to the degrees of
vice, nor is the man of highe&s;t virtue, even ab&s;tract|ing
from external accidents, always the mo&s;t happy.
A gloomy and melancholy di&s;po&s;ition is certainly, <HI>to
our &s;entiments,</HI> a vice or imperfection; but as it may
be accompanied with great &s;en&s;e of honour and great
integrity, it may be found in very worthy character;
tho' 'tis &s;ufficient alone to imbitter life, and render the
per&s;on affected with it compleatly mi&s;erable. On the
other hand, a &s;elfi&s;h villain may po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;pring and
alacrity of temper, a certain <HI>gaiety of heart,</HI> which is
indeed a good quality, but which is rewarded much
beyond its merit, and when attended with good for|tune,
will compen&s;ate the unea&s;ine&s;s and remor&s;e ari&s;|ing
from all the other vices.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, as an ob&s;ervation to the &s;ame pur|po&s;e,
that if a man be liable to a vice or imperfection,
it may often happen, that a good quality, which he
po&s;&s;e&s;es with it, will render him more mi&s;erable, than
<PB N="294" REF="288">
if he were completely vicious. A per&s;on of &s;uch im|b$c$$$ty
of temper, as to be ea&s;ily broke by affeiction,
is more unhappy for being endowed with a generous
and friendly di&s;po&s;ition, which gives him a lively con|cern
for others, and expo&s;es him the more to fortune
and accidents. A &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, in an imperfect
character, is certainly a virtue, but produces great un|ea&s;ine&s;s
and remor&s;e, from which the abandoned vil|lain
is entirely free. A very amorous complexion,
with a heart incapable of friend&s;hip, is happier than
the &s;ame exce&s;s in love, with a genero&s;ity of temper,
which tran&s;ports a man beyond him&s;elf, and renders
him a total &s;lave to the object of his pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN a word, human life is more governed by for|tune
than by rea&s;on; is to be regarded more as a
d$$l pa&s;time than as a &s;erious occupation; and is more
influenced by particular humour than by general prin|ciples.
Shall we engage our&s;elves in it with pa&s;&s;ion
and anxiety? It is not worthy of &s;o much concern.
Shall we be indifferent about what happens? We lo&s;e all
the plea&s;ure of the game by our phlegm and carele&s;&s;|ne&s;s.
While we are rea&s;oning concerning life, life is
gone; and death, tho' <HI>perhaps</HI> they receive him dif|ferently,
yet treats alike the fool and the philo&s;opher.
To reduce life to exact rule and method, is com|monly
a painful, oft a fruitle&s;s occupation: And is it
not al&s;o a proof, that we overvalue the prize for
<PB N="295" REF="289">
which we contend? Even to rea&s;on &s;o carefully con|cerning
it, and to fix with accuracy its ju&s;t idea,
would be over-valuing it, were it not that, to &s;ome
tempers, this occupation is one of the mo&s;t amu&s;ing,
in which life could po&s;&s;ibly be employed.</P>

SEVARAMBIANS, where a great many men and a
<PB N="299" REF="292">
few women are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;hipwrecked on a de|&s;ert
coa&s;t; the captain of the troop, in order to ob|viate
tho&s;e endle&s;s quarrels which aro&s;e, regulates
their marriages after the following manner: he takes
a hand&s;ome female to him&s;elf alone; a&s;&s;igns one to
every couple of inferior officers; and to five of the
lowe&s;t rank he gives one wi&s;e in common. Could the
greate&s;t legi&s;lator, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, have con|trived
matters with greater wi&s;dom?</P>
<P>THE ancient BRITONS had a very &s;ingular kind of
marriage, which is to be met with among no other
people. Any number of them, as ten or a dozen,
joined in a &s;ociety together, which was perhaps re|qui&s;ite
for mutual defence in tho&s;e barbarous times.
In order to link this &s;ociety the clo&s;er, they took an
equal number of wives in common, and whatever
children were born, were reputed to belong to all of
them, and were accordingly provided for by the whole
community.</P>
<P>AMONG the inferior creatures, nature her&s;elf, being
the &s;upreme legi&s;lator, pre&s;cribes all the laws which
regulate their marriages; and varies tho&s;e laws ac|cording
to the different circum&s;tances of the creature.
Where &s;he furni&s;hes, with ea&s;e, food and defence to
the new-born animal, the pre&s;ent embrace terminates
the marriage; and the care of the offspring is commit|ted
entirely to the female. Where the food is of more
<PB N="300" REF="293">
difficult purcha&s;e, the marriage continues for one &s;ea|&s;on,
till the common progeny can provide for it&s;elf;
and then the union immediately di&s;&s;olves, and leaves
each of the parties free to enter into a new engagement
at the en&s;uing &s;ea&s;on. But nature having endowed man,
with rea&s;on, has not &s;o exactly regulated every article of
his marriage contract, but has left him to adju&s;t them,
by his own prudence, according to his particular cir|cum&s;tances
and &s;ituation. Municipal laws are a &s;up|ply
to the wi&s;dom of each individual; and, at the
&s;ame time, by re&s;training the natural liberty of men,
make the private intere&s;t &s;ubmit to the intere&s;t of the
public. All regulations, therefore, on this head are
equally lawful, and equally conformable to the prin|ciples
of nature; tho' they are not all equally conve|nient,
or equally u&s;eful to &s;ociety. The laws may
allow of polygamy, as among the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> nations; or
of voluntary divorces, as among the GREEKS and RO|MANS;
or they may confine one man to one woman,
during the whole cour&s;e of their lives, as among the
modern EUROPEANS. It may not be di&s;agreeable to
con&s;ider the advantages and di&s;advantages which re|&s;ult
from each of the&s;e in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>THE advocates for polygamy may recommend it as
the only effectual remedy for the furies and di&s;orders
of love, and the only expedient for freeing men from
that &s;lavery to the females, which the natural violence
of our pa&s;&s;ions has impo&s;ed on us. By this means
<PB N="301" REF="294">
alone can we regain our right of &s;overeignty; and,
&s;ating our appetite, re-e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of rea&s;on
in our minds, and, of con&s;equence, our own au|thority
in our families. Man, like a weak &s;overeign,
being unable to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t the wiles and
intrigue, of his &s;ubjects, mu&s;t play one faction again&s;t
another, and become ab&s;olute by the mutual jealou&s;ies
of the females. <HI>To divide and to govern</HI> is an univer|&s;al
maxim; and by neglecting it, the EUROPEANS
undergo a more grievous and a more ignominious &s;la|very
than the TURKS or PERSIANS, who are &s;ub|jected
indeed to a &s;overeign, who lies at a di&s;tance
from them, but in their dome&s;tic affairs rule with an
uncontroulable &s;way. An hone&s;t TURK, who &s;hould
come from his &s;eraglio, where every one trembles be|fore
him, would be &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee SYLVIA in her
drawing-room, adored by all the beaus and pretty fel|lows
about town, and he would certainly take her for
&s;ome, mighty and de&s;potic queen, &s;urrounded by her
guard of ob&s;equious &s;laves and eunuchs.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, it may be urged with better
rea&s;on, that this &s;overeignty of the male is a real
u&s;urpation, and de&s;troys that nearne&s;s of rank, not to
&s;ay equality, which nature has e&s;tabli&s;hed between the
&s;exes. We are, by nature, their lovers, their&punc; friends,
their patrons: Would we willingly change &s;uch en|dearing
appellations, for the barbarous titles of ma&s;ter
and tyrant?</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="295">
IN what capacity &s;hall we gain by this inhuman
proceeding? As lovers, or as hu&s;bands? The <HI>lover,</HI>
is totally annihilated; and court&s;hip, the mo&s;t agree|able
&s;cene in human life, can no longer have place,
where women have not the free di&s;po&s;al of them&s;elves,
but are bought and &s;old, like the meane&s;t animals.
The <HI>hu&s;band</HI> is as little a gainer, having found the
admirable &s;ecret of extingui&s;hing every part of love,
except its jealou&s;y. There is no ro&s;e without its
thorn; but he mu&s;t be a fooli&s;h wretch indeed, who
throws away the ro&s;e and pre&s;erves only the thorn.</P>
<P>WOULD not willingly in&s;i&s;t upon it as an advan|tage
in our EUROPEAN cu&s;toms, what was ob&s;erved
by MEHEMET EFFENDI the la&s;t TURKISH amba&s;&s;ador
in FRANCE. <HI>We</HI> TURKS, <HI>&s;ays he, are great &s;impletons
in compari&s;on of the chri&s;tians. We are at the expence
and trouble of keeping a &s;eraglio, each in his own hou&s;e:
But you ea&s;e your&s;elves of this h$rden, and have your &s;e|raglio
in your friends hou&s;es.</HI> The known virtue of our
BRITISH ladies frees them &s;ufficiently from this im|putation:
And the TURK him&s;elf, had he travelled
among us, mu&s;t have owned, that our free commerce
with the fair &s;ex, more than any other invention,
embelli&s;hes, enlivens, and poli&s;hes &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BUT the ASIATIC manners are as de&s;ructive to
friend&s;hip as to love. Jealou&s;y excludes men from
<PB N="303" REF="296">
all intimacies and familiarities with each other. No
man dares bring his friend to his hou&s;e or table, le&s;t
he bring a lover to his numerous wives. Hence all
over the ea&s;t, each family is as &s;eparate from another,
as if they were &s;o many di&s;tinct kingdoms. No won|der
then, that SOLOMON, living like an ea&s;tern prince,
with his &s;even hundred wives, and three hundred con|cubines,
without one friend, could write &s;o patheti|cally
concerning the vanity of the world. Had he
tried the &s;ecret of one wife or mi&s;tre&s;s, a few friends,
and a great many companions, he might have found
life &s;omewhat more agreeable. De&s;troy love and
friend&s;hip; what remains in the world worth accept|ing?</P>
<P>THE bad education of children, e&s;pecially children
of condition, is another unavoidable con&s;equence of
the&s;e in&s;titutions. Tho&s;e, who pa&s;s all the early part
of life among &s;laves, are only qualified to be, them|&s;elves,
&s;laves and tyrants; and in every future inter|cour&s;e,
either with their inferiors or &s;uperiors, are apt
to forget the natural equality of mankind. What
attention, too, can it be &s;uppo&s;ed a parent, who&s;e &s;e|raglio
affords him fifty &s;ons, will give to the in&s;tilling
principles of morality or &s;cience into a progeny, with
whom he him&s;elf is &s;carcely acquainted, and whom
he loves with &s;o divided an affection? Barbari&s;m,
therefore, appears, from rea&s;on as well as experience,
to be the in&s;eparable concomitant of polygamy.</P>
<P><PB N="304" REF="297">
To render polygamy more odious, I need not re|count
the frightful effects of jealou&s;y, and the con|&s;traint
in which it holds the fair-&s;ex all over the ea&s;t.
In tho&s;e countries men are not allowed to have any
commerce with the females, not even phy&s;icians,
when &s;ickne&s;s may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have extingui&s;hed
all wanton pa&s;&s;ions in the bo&s;oms of the fair, and, at
the &s;ame time, has rendered them unfit objects of
de&s;ire. TOURNEFORT tells us, That when he was
brought into the <HI>grand &s;ignior</HI>'s feraglio as a phy&s;ician,
he was not a little &s;urprized, in looking along a gal|lery,
to &s;ee a great number of naked arms, &s;tanding
out from the &s;ides of the room. He could not ima|gine
what this could mean; till he was told, that
tho&s;e arms belonged to bodies, which he mu&s;t cure,
without knowing any more about them, than what
he could learn from the arms. He was not allowed
to a&s;k a que&s;tion of the patient, or even of her at|tendants,
le&s;t he might find it nece&s;&s;ary to enquire
concerning circum&s;tances, which the delicacy of the
&s;eraglio allows not to be revealed. Hence the phy|&s;icians
in the ea&s;tern countries pretend to know all
di&s;ea&s;es from the pul&s;e; as our quacks in EUROPE
undertake to cure a per&s;on merely from &s;eeing his wa|ter.
I &s;uppo&s;e, had <HI>Mon&s;ieur</HI> TOURNEFORT been of
this latter kind, he would not, in CONSTANTINOPLE,
have been allowed by the jealous TURKS to be fur|ni&s;hed
with materials requi&s;ite for exerci&s;ing his ar$&punc;</P>
<P><PB N="305" REF="298">
IN another country, where polygamy is al&s;o allowed,
they render their wives cripples, and make their feet
of no u&s;e to them, in order to con&s;ine them to their
own hou&s;es. But it will, perhaps, appear &s;trange,
that in an EUROPEAN country, where polygamy is
not allowed, jealou&s;y can yet be carried to &s;uch a
height, that 'tis indecent &s;o much as to &s;uppo&s;e, that
a woman of rank can have feet or legs. A SPA|NIARD
is jealous of the very thoughts of tho&s;e who
approach his wife; and, if po&s;&s;ible, will prevent his
being di&s;honoured, even by the wantonne&s;s of ima|gination.
Witne&s;s the following &s;tory, which we
have from very good authority<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Memoirs de la cour d'<HI>ESPAGNE</HI> par Madame d'<HI>AUNOY.</HI></NOTE>. When the mother
of the late king of SPAIN was on her road towards
MADRID, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed thro' a little town in SPAIN, fa|mous
for its manufactory of gloves and &s;tockings.
The hone&s;t magi&s;trates of the place thought they could
not better expre&s;s their joy for the reception of their
new queen, than by pre&s;enting her with a &s;ample of
tho&s;e commodities, for which alone their town was
remarkable. The <HI>major-domo,</HI> who conducted the
queen, received the gloves very graciou&s;ly: But when
the &s;tockings were pre&s;ented, he flung them away with
great indignation, and &s;everely reprimanded the ma|gi&s;trates
for this egregious piece of indecency. <HI>Know,</HI>
&s;ays he, <HI>That a queen of</HI> SPAIN <HI>has no legs.</HI> The poor
young queen, who, at that time, under&s;tood the lan|guage
<PB N="306" REF="299">
but very imperfectly, and had been often
frightened with &s;tories of SPANISH jealou&s;y, ima|gined
that they were to cut off her legs. Upon
which &s;he fell a crying, and begged them to conduct
her back to GERMANY; for that &s;he never could en|dure
that operation: And it was with &s;ome difficulty
they could appea&s;e her. PHILIP IV. is &s;aid never in
his life to have laughed heartily, but at the recital of
this &s;tory.</P>
<P>IF a SPANISH lady mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
legs, what mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed of a TURKISH lady?
She mu&s;t not be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a being at all. Ac|cordingly,
'tis e&s;teemed a piece of rudene&s;s and inde|cency
at CONSTANTINOPLE, ever to make mention
of a man's wives before him<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Memoires de Marquis d'<HI>ARGENS</HI>&punc;</NOTE>. In EUROPE, 'tis
true, fine bred people make it al&s;o a rule never to
talk of their wives: But the rea&s;on is not founded on
our jealou&s;y. I &s;uppo&s;e it is becau&s;e we &s;hould be apt,
were it not for this rule, to become trouble&s;ome to
company, by talking too much of them.</P>
<P>THE author of the PERSIAN letters has given a
different rea&s;on for this polite maxim. <HI>Men,</HI> &s;ays he,
<HI>never care to mention their wives in company, le$t they
&s;hould talk of them before people, who are better ac|quainted
with them than them&s;elves.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="307" REF="300">
HAVING rejected polygamy, and matched one man
with one woman, let us now con&s;ider what duration
we &s;hall a&s;&s;ign to their union, and whether we &s;hall
admit of tho&s;e voluntary divorces, which were in u&s;e
among the GREEKS and ROMANS. They who would
defend this practice, may employ the following rea|&s;ons.</P>
<P>How often does di&s;gu&s;t and aver&s;ion ari&s;e after
marriage, from the mo&s;t trivial accidents, or from an
incompatibility of humour; where time, in&s;tead of
curing the wounds proceeding from mutual injuries,
fe&s;ters them every day the more, by new quarrels and
reproaches? Let us &s;eparate hearts, which are not
made for each other. Each of them may, perhaps,
find another, for which it is better fitted. At lea&s;t,
nothing can be more cruel, than to pre&s;erve, by vio|lence,
an union, which, at fir&s;t, was made by mutual
love, and is now, in effect, di&s;&s;olved by mutual
hatred.</P>
<P>BUT the liberty of divorces is not only a cure to
hatred and dome&s;tic quarrels: It is al&s;o an admirable
pre&s;ervative again&s;t them, and the only &s;ecret for
keeping alive that love, which fir&s;t united the mar|ried
couple. The heart of man delights in liberty:
The very image of con&s;traint is grievous to it: When
you would confine it by violence, to what would
otherwi&s;e have been its choice, the inclination im|mediately
<PB N="308" REF="301">
changes, and de&s;ire is turned into aver&s;ion.
If the public intere&s;t will not allow us to enjoy in
polygamy that <HI>variety,</HI> which is &s;o agreeable in love;
at lea&s;t, deprive us not of that liberty, which is &s;o
e&s;&s;entially requi&s;ite. In vain you tell me, that I had
my choice of the per&s;on, with whom I would conjoin
my&s;elf. I had my choice, 'tis true, of my pri&s;on;
but this is but a &s;mall comfort, &s;ince it mu&s;t &s;till be a
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>SUCH are the arguments, which may be urged in
favour of divorces: But there &s;eem to be the&s;e three
unan&s;werable objections again&s;t them: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> What
mu&s;t become of the children, upon the &s;eparation of
the parents? Mu&s;t they be committed to the care of a
&s;tepmother; and in&s;tead of the fond attention and
concern of a parent, feel all the indifference or hatred
of a &s;tranger or an enemy? The&s;e inconveniences are
&s;ufficiently felt, where nature has made the divorce by
the doom inevitable to all mortals: And &s;hall we &s;eek
to multiply the&s;e inconveniences, by multiplying di|vorces,
and putting it in the power of parents, upon
every caprice, to render their po&s;terity mi&s;erable?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IF it be true, on the one hand, that the
heart of man naturally delights in liberty, and hates
every thing to which it is confined; 'tis al&s;o true, on
the other hand, that the heart of man naturally &s;ub|mits
to nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;oon lo&s;es an inclination, when
<PB N="309" REF="302">
there appears an ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility of gratifying it. The&s;e
principles of human nature, you will &s;ay, are
contradictory: But what is man but a heap of con|tradictions?
Tho' 'tis remarkable, that where prin|ciples
are, after this manner, contrary in their ope|ration,
they do not always de&s;troy each other; but
the one or the other may predominate on any particu|lar
occa&s;ion, according as circum&s;tances are more or
le&s;s favourable to it. For in&s;tance, love is a re&s;tle&s;s
and impatient pa&s;&s;ion, full of caprices and variations;
ari&s;ing in a moment from a feature, from an air, from
nothing, and &s;uddenly extingui&s;hing after the &s;ame
manner. Such a pa&s;&s;ion requires liberty above all
things; and therefore ELOISA had rea&s;on, when, in
order to pre&s;erve this pa&s;&s;ion, &s;he refu&s;ed to marry her
beloved ABELARD.</P>
<Q><L>How oft, when pre&s;t to marriage, have I &s;aid,</L>
<L>Cur&s;e on all laws but tho&s;e which love has made:</L>
<L>Love, free as air, at &s;ight of human ties,</L>
<L>Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.</L></Q>
<P>But <HI>friend&s;hip</HI> is a calm and &s;edate affection, conducted
by rea&s;on and cemented by habit; &s;pringing from
long acquaintance and mutual obligations; without
jealou&s;ies or fears, and without tho&s;e feveri&s;h fits of
heat and cold, which cau&s;e &s;uch an agreeable torment
in the amorous pa&s;&s;ion. So &s;ober an affection, there|fore,
as friend&s;hip, rather thrives under con&s;traint,
<PB N="310" REF="303">
and never ri&s;es to &s;uch a height, as when any &s;trong
intere&s;t or nece&s;&s;ity binds two per&s;ons together, and
gives them &s;ome common object of pur&s;uit. Let us
con&s;ider then, whether love or friend&s;hip &s;hould mo&s;t
predominate in marriage; and we &s;hall &s;oon deter|mine
whether liberty or con&s;traint be mo&s;t favorable
to it. The happie&s;t marriages, to be &s;ure, are found
where love, by long acquaintance, is con&s;olidated in|to
friend&s;hip. Whoever dreams of raptures and ex|ta&s;ies
beyond the honey-moon, is a fool. Even ro|mances
them&s;elves, with all their liberty of fiction,
are obliged to drop their lovers the very day of their
marriage, and find it ea&s;ier to &s;upport the pa&s;&s;ion for
a dozen years under coldne&s;s, di&s;dain and difficulties,
than a week under po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;ecurity. We need
not, therefore, be afraid of drawing the marriage|knot
the clo&s;e&s;t po&s;&s;ible. The friend&s;hip between the
per&s;ons, where it is &s;olid and &s;incere, will rather gain
by it: And where it is wavering and uncertain, this
is the be&s;t expedient for fixing it. How many fri|volous
quarrels and di&s;gu&s;ts are there, which people
of common prudence endeavour to forget, when they
lye under a nece&s;&s;ity of pa&s;&s;ing their lives together;
but which would &s;oon inflame into the mo&s;t deadly
hatred, were they pur&s;ued to the utmo&s;t, under the
pro&s;pect of an ea&s;y &s;eparation?</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="304">
IN the <HI>third</HI> place, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that nothing
is more dangerous than to unite two per&s;ons &s;o clo&s;ely
in all their intere&s;ts and concerns, as man and wife,
without rendering the union intire and total. The
lea&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of a &s;eparate intere&s;t mu&s;t be the &s;ource
of endle&s;s quarrels and jealou&s;ies. What Dr. PARNEL
calls,
<Q>The little pilf'ring temper of a wife,</Q>
will be doubly ruinous; and the hu&s;band's &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,
being accompanied with more power, may be &s;till
more dangerous.</P>
<P>SHOULD the&s;e rea&s;ons again&s;t voluntary divorces be
e&s;teemed in&s;ufficient, I hope no body will pretend to
refu&s;e the te&s;timony of experience. At the time
when divorces were mo&s;t frequent among the RO|MANS,
marriages were mo&s;t rare; and AUGUSTUS
was obliged, by penal laws, to force the men of
fa&s;hion into the married &s;tate: A circum&s;tance which
is &s;carce to be found in any other age or nation.
The more ancient laws of ROME which prohibited
divorces, are extremely prai&s;ed by DIONYSIUS HALY|CARNASSAEUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE>. Wonderful was the harmony, &s;ays
the hi&s;torian, which this in&s;eparable union of inte|re&s;ts
produced between married per&s;ons; while each
of them con&s;idered the inevitable nece&s;&s;ity by which
<PB N="312" REF="305">
they were linked together, and abandoned all pro|&s;pect
of any other choice or e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>

The ju&s;tne&s;s of the repre&s;entation is lo&s;t, and the
mind is di&s;plea&s;ed to find a picture, which bears no
re&s;emblance to any original. Nor are &s;uch exce&s;&s;ive
refinements more agreeable in the epi&s;tolary or philo|&s;ophic
&s;tile, than in the epic or tragic. Too much
ornament is a fault in every kind of production. Un|common
expre&s;&s;ions, &s;trong fla&s;hes of wit, pointed
<PB N="315" REF="308">
&s;imilies, and epigrammatic turns, e&s;pecially when
they occur too frequently, are a disfigurement, rather
than any embelli&s;hment of di&s;cour&s;e. As the eye, in
&s;urveying a GOTHIC building, is di&s;tracted by the
multiplicity of ornaments, and lo&s;es the whole by its
minute attention to the parts; &s;o the mind, in per|u&s;ing
a work over&s;tocked with wit, is fatigued and
di&s;gu&s;ted with the con&s;tant endeavour to &s;hine and
&s;urprize. This is the ca&s;e where a writer over|abounds
in wit, even tho' that wit, in it&s;elf, &s;hould be
ju&s;t and agreeable. But it commonly happens to &s;uch
writers, that they &s;eek for their favourite ornaments,
even where the &s;ubject affords them not; and by that
means, have twenty in&s;ipid conceits for one thought
which is really beautiful.</P>
<P>THERE is no &s;ubject in critical learning more co|pious
than this of the ju&s;t mixture of &s;implicity and
refinement in writing; and therefore, not to wander
in too large a field, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to a few
general ob&s;ervations on that head.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I ob&s;erve, <HI>That tho' exce&s;&s;es of both kinds are
to be avoided, and tho' a proper medium ought to be
&s;tudied in all productions; yet this medium lies not in a
point, but admits of a very con&s;iderable latitude.</HI> Con|&s;ider
the wide di&s;tance, in this re&s;pect, between Mr.
POPE and LUCRETIUS. The&s;e &s;eem to lie in the
two greate&s;t extremes of refinement and &s;implicity, in
<PB N="316" REF="309">
which a poet can indulge him&s;elf, without being
guilty of any blameable exce&s;s. All this interval may
be filled with poets, who may differ from each other,
but may be equally admirable, each in his peculiar
&s;tile and manner. CORNEILLE and CONGREVE,
who carry their wit and refinement &s;omewhat farther
than Mr. POPE (if poets of &s;o different a kind can be
compared together) and SOPHOCLES and TERENCE,
who are more &s;imple than LUCRETIUS, &s;eem to
have gone out of that medium, in which the mo&s;t
perfect productions are found, and to be guilty of
&s;ome exce&s;s in the&s;e oppo&s;ite characters. Of all the
great poets, VIRGIL and RACINE, in my opinion,
lie neare&s;t the center, and are the farthe&s;t removed
from both the extremities.</P>
<P>MY <HI>&s;econd</HI> ob&s;ervation on this head is, <HI>That it is
very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to explain by words,
where the ju&s;t medium between the exce&s;&s;es of &s;implicity
and refinement lies, or to give any rule, by which we
can know preci&s;ely the bounds between the fault and the
beauty.</HI> A critic may not only di&s;cour&s;e very judici|ou&s;ly
on this head, without in&s;tructing his readers, but
even without under&s;tanding the matter perfectly him|&s;elf.
There is not a finer piece of critici&s;m than <HI>the
di&s;&s;ertation on pa&s;torals</HI> by FONTENELLE; where, by
a number of reflections and philo&s;ophical rea&s;onings,
he endeavours to fix the ju&s;t medium, which is &s;uitable
to that &s;pecies of writing. But let any one read the
<PB N="317" REF="310">
pa&s;torals of that author, and he will be convinced
that this judicious critic, notwith&s;tanding his fine
rea&s;onings, had a fal&s;e ta&s;te, and fixed the point of
perfection much nearer the extreme of refinement
than pa&s;toral poetry will admit of. The &s;entiments
of his &s;hepherds are better &s;uited to the toilettes of
PARIS, than to the fore&s;ts of ARCADIA. But this it
is impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cover from his critical rea&s;onings.
He blames all exce&s;&s;ive painting and ornament as
much as VIRGIL could have done, had <HI>he</HI> wrote a
differtation on that &s;pecies of poetry. However dif|ferent
the ta&s;tes of men may be, their general di&s;|cour&s;es
on the&s;e &s;ubjects are commonly the &s;ame. No
critici&s;m can be very in&s;tructive, which de&s;cends not
to particulars, and is not full of examples and illu&s;tra|tions.
'Tis allowed on all hands, that beauty, as
well as virtue, lies always in a medium; but where
this medium is placed, is the great que&s;tion, and can
never be &s;ufficiently explained by general rea&s;onings.</P>
<P><HI>I SHALL deliver it as a</HI> third <HI>ob&s;ervation on this
&s;ubject,</HI> That we ought to be more on our guard again&s;t
the exce&s;s of refinement than that of &s;implicity; and that
beacau&s;e the former exce&s;s is both le&s;s <HI>beautiful,</HI> and
more <HI>dangerous</HI> than the latter.</P>
<P>'TIS a certain rule, that wit and pa&s;&s;ion are intirely
incon&s;i&s;tent. When the affections are moved, there is
no place for the imagination. The mind of man be|ing
<PB N="318" REF="311">
naturally limited, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible, that all its fa|culties
can operate at once: And the more any one
predominates, the le&s;s room is there for the others to
exert their vigour. For this rea&s;on, a greater degree
of &s;implicity is required in all compo&s;itions, where
men, and actions, and pa&s;&s;ions are painted, than in
&s;uch as con&s;i&s;t of reflections and ob&s;ervations. And as
the former &s;pecies of writing is the more engaging
and beautiful, one may &s;afely, upon this account, give
the preference to the extreme of &s;implicity above that
of refinement.</P>
<P>WE may al&s;o ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e compo&s;itions,
which we read the oftene&s;t, and which every man of
ta&s;te has got by heart, have the recommendation of
&s;implicity, and have nothing &s;urprizing in the thought,
when dive&s;ted of that elegance of expre&s;&s;ion, and
harmony of numbers, with which it is cloathed. If
the merit of the compo&s;ition lies in a point of wit;
it may &s;trike at fir&s;t; but the mind anticipates the
thought in the &s;econd peru&s;al, and is no longer affect|ed
by it. When I read an epigram of MARTIAL,
the fir&s;t line recalls the whole; and I have no plea&s;ure
in repeating to my&s;elf what I know already. But
each line, each word in CATULLUS, has its merit;
and I am never tired with the peru&s;al of him. 'Tis
&s;ufficient to run over COWLEY once: But PARNEL,
after the fiftieth reading, is as fre&s;h as at the fir&s;.
Be&s;ides, 'tis with books, as with women, where a
<PB N="319" REF="312">
certain plainne&s;s of manner and of dre&s;s is more en|gaging
than that glare of paint and airs and apparel,
which may dazzle the eye, but reaches not the affec|tions.
TERENCE is a mode&s;t and ba&s;hful beauty, to
whom we grant every thing, becau&s;e he a&s;&s;umes no|thing,
and who&s;e purity and nature make a durable,
tho' not a violent impre&s;&s;ion on us.</P>
<P>BUT refinement, as it is the le&s;s <HI>beautiful,</HI> &s;o is it
the more <HI>dangerous</HI> extreme, and what we are the apt|e&s;t
to fall into. Simplicity pa&s;&s;es for dulne&s;s, when it
is not accompanied with great elegance and propriety.
On the contrary, there is &s;omething &s;urprizing in a
blaze of wit and conceit. Ordinary readers are
mightily &s;truck with it, and fal&s;ely imagine it to be
the mo&s;t difficult, as well as mo&s;t excellent way of
writing. SENECA abounds with agreeable faults, &s;ays
QUINTILIAN, <HI>abundat dulcibus vitiis;</HI> and for that
rea&s;on is the more dangerous, and the more apt to
pervert the ta&s;te of the young and incon&s;iderate.</P>
<P>I SHALL add, that the exce&s;s of refinement is now
more to be guarded again&s;t than ever; becau&s;e$tis
the extreme, which men are the mo&s;t apt to fall into,
after learning has made great progre&s;s, and after
eminent writers have appeared in every &s;pecies of
compo&s;ition. The endeavour to plea&s;e by novelty
leads men wide of &s;implicity and nature, and fills
their writings with affectation and conceit. It was
<PB N="320" REF="313">
thus the ASIATIC eloquence degenerated &s;o much
from the ATTIC. It was thus the age of CLAUDIUS
and NERO became &s;o much inferior to that of AU|GUSTUS
in ta&s;te and genius: And perhaps there are,
at pre&s;ent, &s;ome &s;ymptoms of a like degeneracy of
ta&s;te, in FRANCE as well as in ENGLAND.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of NATIONAL CHARACTERS.</HEAD>
<P>THE vulgar are very apt to carry all <HI>national
characters</HI> to extremes; and having once e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
it as a principle, that any people are knavi&s;h,
or cowardly, or ignorant, they will admit of no excep|tion,
but comprehend every individual under the
&s;ame character. Men of &s;en&s;e condemn the&s;e undi&s;|tingui&s;hing
judgments: Tho' at the &s;ame time, they
allow, that each nation has a peculiar &s;et of manners,
and that &s;ome particular qualities are more frequently
to be met with among one people than among their
neighbours. The common people in SWISSERLAND
have &s;urely more probity than tho&s;e of the &s;ame rank
in IRELAND; and every prudent man will, from that
circum&s;tance alone, make a difference in the tru&s;t
which he repo&s;es in each. We have rea&s;on to expect
greater wit and gaiety in a FRENCHMAN than in a
SPANIARD; tho' CERVANTES was born in SPAIN.
An ENGLISHMAN will naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to have
<PB N="322" REF="315">
more knowledge than a DANE; tho' TYCHO BRAHE
was a native of DENMARK.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT rea&s;ons are a&s;&s;igned for the&s;e <HI>national
characters;</HI> while &s;ome account for them from <HI>moral</HI>
and others from <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es. By <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es, I
mean all circum&s;tances, which are fitted to work on
the mind as motives or rea&s;ons, and which render a
peculiar &s;et of manners habitual to us. Of this kind
are, the nature of the government, the revolutions
of public affairs, the plenty or penury in which the
people live, the &s;ituation of the nation with regard
to its neighbours, and &s;uch like circum&s;tances. By
<HI>phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es, I mean tho&s;e qualities of the air and
climate, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to work in&s;en&s;ibly on the
temper, by altering the tone and habit of the body,
and giving a particular complexion, which tho' re|flection
and rea&s;on may &s;ometimes overcome, yet will
it prevail among the generality of mankind, and have
an influence on their manners.</P>
<P>THAT the character of a nation will very much de|pend
on <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es, mu&s;t be evident to the mo&s;t &s;u|perficial
ob&s;erver; &s;ince a nation is nothing but a col|lection
of individuals, and the manners of individuals
are frequently determined by the&s;e cau&s;es. As po|verty
and hard labour deba&s;e the minds of the com|mon
people, and render them unfit for any &s;cience
and ingenious profe&s;&s;ion; &s;o where any government
<PB N="323" REF="316">
becomes very oppre&s;&s;ive to all its &s;ubjects, it mu&s;t
have a proportional effect on their temper and ge|nius,
and mu&s;t bani&s;h all the liberal arts from among
them. In&s;tances of this nature are very frequent in
the world.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle of moral cau&s;es fixes the cha|racter
of different profe&s;&s;ions, and alters even that
di&s;po&s;ition, which the particular members receive
from the hand of nature. A <HI>&s;oldier</HI> and a <HI>prie&s;t</HI> are
different characters, in all nations, and all ages; and
this difference is founded on circum&s;tances, who&s;e
operation is eternal and unalterable.</P>
<P>THE uncertainty of their life makes &s;oldiers lavi&s;h
and generous as well as brave: Their idlene&s;s, as
well as the large &s;ocieties, which they form in camps
or garri&s;ons, inclines them to plea&s;ure and gallantry:
By their frequent change of company, they acquire
good breeding and an openne&s;s of behaviour: Being
employed only again&s;t a public and an open enemy,
they become candid, hone&s;t, and unde&s;igning: And
as they u&s;e more the labour of the body than that of
the mind, they are commonly thoughtle&s;s and igno|rant<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">'TIS a &s;aying of MENANDER, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. MEN. apud STORAEU$ <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. '<HI>Tis not in the power even of God to make a polite &s;oldier.</HI> The contrary ob&s;ervation with regard to the manners of &s;oldiers takes place in cur days. This &s;eems to me a pre&s;umption, that the ancients owed all their refinement and civility to books and &s;tudy; for which, indeed, a &s;oldier's life is not &s;o well calcu|lated.

<P><PB N="324" REF="317">
'TIS a trite, but not altogether a fal&s;e maxim, that
<HI>prie&s;ts of all religions are the &s;ame;</HI> and tho' the cha|racter
of the profe&s;&s;ion will not, in every in&s;tance,
prevail over the per&s;onal character, yet it is &s;ure al|ways
to predominate with the greater number. For
as chymi&s;ts ob&s;erve, that &s;pirits, when rai&s;ed to a
certain height, are all the &s;ame, from whatever mate|rials
they be extracted; &s;o the&s;e men, being elevated
above humanity, acquire a uniform character, which
is intirely their own, and which, in my opinion, is,
generally &s;peaking, not the mo&s;t amiable that is to
be met with in human &s;ociety. It is, in mo&s;t points,
oppo&s;ite to that of a &s;oldier; as is the way of life,
from which it is derived<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>Tho' all mankind have a &s;trong propen&s;ity to religion at certain times and in certain di&s;po&s;itions; yet are there few or none, who have it to that degree, and with that con&s;tancy, which is requi&s;ite to &s;upport the character of this profe&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t, therefore, happen, that clergymen, being drawn from the common ma&s;s of mankind, as people are to other employ|ments, by the views of profit, the greate&s;t part, tho' no athei&s;ts or free-thinkers, will find it nece&s;&s;ary, on particular occa&s;ions, to feign more devotion than they are, at that time, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, and to maintain the appearance of fervor and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, even when jaded with the exerci&s;es of their religion, or when they have their minds engaged in the common occupations of life. They mu&s;t not, like the re&s;t of the world, give &s;cope to their natural movements and &s;entiments: They mu&s;t &s;et a guard over their looks and words and actions: And in order to &s;upport the veneration paid them by the ignorant vulgar, they mu&s;t not only keep a remarkable re&s;erve, but mu&s;t promote the &s;pirit of &s;uper&s;tition, by a continued grimace and hypocri&s;y. This di&s;&s;imulation often de&s;troys the candour and ingenuity of their temper, and makes an irreparable breach in their character.</P>
<P>If by chance any of them be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a temper more &s;u&s;|ceptible of devotion than u&s;ual, &s;o that he has but little occa&s;ion for hypocri&s;y to &s;upport the character of his profe&s;&s;ion; 'tis &s;o natural for him to over-rate this advantage, and to think that it atones for every violation of morality, that frequently he is not more virtuous than the hypocrite. And tho' few dare openly avow tho&s;e exploded opinions, <HI>that every thing is lawful to the &s;aints, and that they alone have property in their goods;</HI> yet we may ob&s;erve, that the&s;e principles lurk in every bo&s;om, and repre&s;ent a zeal for religious ob&s;ervances as &s;o great a merit, that it may compen&s;ate for many vices and enormities. This ob&s;ervation is &s;o common, that all prudent men are on their guard, when they meet with any extraordinary appearance of religion; tho' at the &s;ame time, they confe&s;s, that there are many exceptions to this general rule, and that probity and &s;uper&s;tition are not altogether incompatible.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men are ambitious; but the ambition of other men may commonly be &s;atisfied, by excelling in their particular profe&s;&s;ion, and thereby promoting the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. The ambition of the clergy can often be &s;atisfied only by promoting ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition and implicite faith and pious frauds. And hav|ing got what ARCHIMEDES only wanted, (<HI>viz,</HI> another world, on which he could fix his engines) no wonder they move this world at their plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men have an over-weaning conceit of them&s;elves; but <HI>the&s;e</HI> have a peculiar temptation to that vice, who are regarded with &s;uch veneration, and are even deemed &s;acred, by the igno|rant multitude.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t men are apt to bear a particular regard for members of their own profe&s;&s;ion; but as a lawyer, or phy&s;ician, or mer|chant does, each of them, follow out his bu&s;ine&s;s apart, the in|tere&s;ts of the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions are not &s;o clo&s;ely united as the intere&s;ts of clergymen of the &s;ame religion; where the whole body gains by the veneration, paid to their common tenets, and by the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>Few men can bear contradiction with patience; but the clergy too often proceed even to a degree of fury on this article: Be|cau&s;e all their credit and livelihood depend upon the belief, which their opinions meet with; and they alone pretend to a divine and &s;upernatural authority, or have any colour for repre|&s;enting their antagoni&s;ts as impious and prophane. The <HI>Odium Thcologicum,</HI> or Theological Hatred, is noted even to a proverb, and means that degree of rancour, which is the mo&s;t furious and implacable.</P>
<P>Revenge is a very natural pa&s;&s;ion to mankind; but &s;eems to reign with the greate&s;t force in prie&s;ts and women: Becau&s;e be|ing deprived of the immediate exertion of anger, in violence and combat, they are apt to fancy them&s;elves de&s;pi&s;ed on that account; and their pride &s;upports their vindictive di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Thus many of the vices of human nature are, by fixed moral cau&s;es, inflamed in that profe&s;&s;ion; and tho' &s;everal individuals e&s;cape the contagion, yet all wi&s;e governments will be on their guard again&s;t the attempts of a &s;ociety, who will for ever com|bine into one faction, and while it acts as a &s;ociety, will for ever be actuated by ambition, pride, revenge, and a per&s;ecuting &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The temper of religion is grave and &s;erious; and this is the character required of prie&s;ts, which confines them to &s;trict rules of decency, and commonly prevents irregularity and intemperance among&s;t them. The gaiety, much le&s;s the exce&s;&s;es of plea&s;ure, is not permitted in that body; and this virtue is, perhaps, the only one, which they owe to their profe&s;&s;ion. In religions, indeed, founded on &s;peculative priniciples, and where public di&s;cour&s;es make a part of religious &s;ervice, it may al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed that the clergy will have a con&s;iderable &s;hare in the learning of the times; tho' 'tis certain that their ta&s;te and eloquence will al|ways be better than their &s;kill in rea&s;oning and philo&s;ophy. But whoever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the other noble virtues of humanity, meekne&s;s, and moderation, as very many of them, no doubt, do, is be|holden for them to nature or reflection, not to the genius of his calling.</P>
<P>'Twas no bad expedient in the ROMANS, for preventing the &s;trong effect of the prie&s;tly character, to make it a law that no one &s;hould be received into the &s;acerdotal office, till he was pa&s;t fifty years of age, DION. <HI>Hal.</HI> lib. 1.

the infancy of &s;ociety, if any of the&s;e di&s;po&s;itions be
found in greater abundance than the re&s;t, it will natu|rally
prevail in the compo&s;ition, and give a tincture to
the national character. Or &s;hould it be a&s;&s;erted, that
no &s;pecies of temper can rea&s;onably be pre&s;umed to
predominate, even in tho&s;e contracted &s;ocieties, and
that the &s;ame proportions will always be pre&s;erved in
the mixture; yet &s;urely the per&s;ons in credit and au|thority,
being a more contracted body, cannot always
be pre&s;umed to be of the &s;ame character; and their
influence on the manners of the people, mu&s;t, at all
times, be very con&s;iderable. If on the fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of a republic, a BRUTUS &s;hould be placed in au|thority,
and be tran&s;ported with &s;uch an enthu&s;ia&s;m
for liberty and public good, as to overlook all the ties
of nature, as well as private intere&s;t, &s;uch an illu&s;|trious
example will naturally have an effect on the
whole &s;ociety, and kindle the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion in every
bo&s;om. Whatever it be that forms the manners of
one generation, the next mu&s;t imbibe a deeper tinc|ture
of the &s;ame dye; men being more &s;u&s;ceptible of
<PB N="331" REF="324">
all impre&s;&s;ions during infancy, and retaining the&s;e
impre&s;&s;ions as long as they remain in the world. I
a&s;&s;ert, then, that all national characters, where they
depend not on fixed <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es, proceed from &s;uch
accidents as the&s;e, and that phy&s;ical cau&s;es have no di&s;|cernible
operation on the human mind.</P>
<P>IF we run over the whole globe, or revolve all the
annals of hi&s;tory, we &s;hall di&s;cover every where &s;igns
of this &s;ympathy or contagion of manners, none of
the influence of air or climate.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> We may ob&s;erve, that where a very exten|&s;ive
government has been e&s;tabli&s;hed for many cen|turies,
it &s;preads a national character over the whole
empire, and communicates to every part a &s;imilitude
of manners. Thus the CHINESE have the greate&s;t
uniformity of character imaginable; tho' the air and
climate, in different parts of tho&s;e va&s;t dominions,
admit of very con&s;iderable variations.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> In &s;mall governments, which are conti|guous,
the people have notwith&s;tanding a different
character, and are often as di&s;tingui&s;hable in their
manners as the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations. ATHENS and
THEBES were but a &s;hort day's journey from each
other; tho' the ATHENIANS were as remarkable for
ingenuity, politene&s;s, and gaiety, as the THEBANS
for dulne&s;s, ru&s;ticity, and a phlegmatic temper.
<PB N="332" REF="325">
PLUTARCH, di&s;cour&s;ing of the effects of air on the
minds of men, ob&s;erves, that the inhabitants of the
PIRAEUM po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed very different tempers from tho&s;e
of the higher town of ATHENS, which was di&s;tant
about four miles from the former: But I believe no
one attributes the difference of manners, in WAPPING
and St. JAMES's, to a difference of air or climate.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> The &s;ame national character commonly
follows the authority of government to a preci&s;e
boundary; and upon cro&s;&s;ing a river or pa&s;&s;ing a
mountain, one finds a new &s;et of manners, with a
new government. The LANGUEDOCIANS and GAS|CONS
are the gaye&s;t people of all FRANCE; but
whenever you pa&s;s the PYRENEES, you are among
SPANIARDS. Is it conceivable, that the qualities of
the air &s;hould change &s;o exactly with the limits of an
empire, which depend &s;o much on the accidents of
battles, negociations, and marriages?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Where any &s;et of men, &s;cattered over
di&s;tant nations, have a clo&s;e &s;ociety or communi|cation
together, they acquire a &s;imilitude of manners,
and have but little in common with the nations
among&s;t whom they live. Thus the JEWS in EU|ROPE,
and the ARMENIANS in the ea&s;t, have a pe|culiar
character; and the former are as much noted
<PB N="333" REF="326">
for fraud, as the latter for probity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A &s;mall &s;ect or &s;ociety amid&s;t a greater are commonly mo&s;t regular in their morals; becau&s;e they are more remarked, and the faults of individuals draw di&s;honour on the whole. The only exception to this rule is, when the &s;uper&s;tition and preju|dices of the large &s;ociety are &s;o &s;trong as to throw an infamy on the &s;maller &s;ociety, independent of their morals. For in that ca&s;e, having no character either to &s;ave or gain, they become carele&s;s of their behaviour, except among them&s;elves.</NOTE>. The <HI>Je&s;uites,</HI>
in all <HI>Roman-catholic</HI> countries, are al&s;o ob&s;erved to
have a character peculiar to them&s;elves.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> Where any accident, as a difference of
language or religion, keeps two nations, inhabiting
the &s;ame country, from mixing with each other, they
will pre&s;erve, during &s;everal centuries, a di&s;tinct and even
oppo&s;ite &s;et of manners. The integrity, gravity, and
bravery of the TURKS, form an exact contra&s;t to the
deceit, levity, and cowardice of the modern GREEKS.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> The &s;ame &s;et of manners will follow a na|tion,
and adhere to them over the whole globe, as
well as the &s;ame laws and language. The SPANISH,
ENGLISH, FRENCH and DUTCH colonies are all di&s;|tingui&s;hable
even between the tropics.</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> The manners of a people change very
con&s;iderably from one age to another; either by great
alterations in their government, by the mixtures of
new people, or by that incon&s;tancy, to which all hu|man
<PB N="334" REF="327">
affairs are &s;ubject. The ingenuity and indu&s;try
of the ancient GREEKS have nothing in common
with the &s;tupidity and indolence of the pre&s;ent inha|bitants
of tho&s;e regions. Candour, bravery, and
love of liberty, formed the character of the ancient
ROMANS; as &s;ubtilty, cowardice, and a &s;lavi&s;h di&s;po|&s;ition
do that of the modern. The old SPANIARDS
were re&s;tle&s;s, turbulent, and &s;o addicted to war, that
many of them killed them&s;elves, when deprived of
their arms by the ROMANS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TIT. LIVII, Lib. 34. Cap. 17.</NOTE>. One would find an equal
difficulty, at pre&s;ent, (at lea&s;t one would have found
it fifty years ago) to rouze up the modern SPANIARDS
to arms. The BATAVIANS were all &s;oldiers of for|tune,
and hired them&s;elves into the ROMAN armies.
Their po&s;terity make u&s;e of foreigners for the &s;ame
purpo&s;e that the ROMANS did their ance&s;tors. Tho'
&s;ome &s;trokes of the FRENCH character be the &s;ame
with that, which CAESAR has a&s;cribed to the GAULS;
yet what compari&s;on between the civility, humanity,
and knowledge of the modern inhabitants of that
country, and the ignorance, barbarity, and gro&s;&s;ne&s;s
of the ancient? Not to in&s;i&s;t upon the great difference
betwixt the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of BRITAIN, and tho&s;e
before the ROMAN conque&s;t; we may ob&s;erve, that
our ance&s;tors, a few centuries ago, were &s;unk into
the mo&s;t abject &s;uper&s;tition, la&s;t century they were
<PB N="335" REF="328">
inflamed with the mo&s;t furious enthu&s;ia&s;m, and are
now &s;ettled into the mo&s;t cool indifference with re|gard
to religious matters, that is to be found in any
nation of the world.</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly.</HI> Where &s;everal neighbouring nations have
a very clo&s;e communication together, either by po|licy,
commerce, or travelling, they acquire a &s;imi|litude
of manners, proportioned to the communica|tion.
Thus all the FRANKS appear to have a uni|form
character to the ea&s;tern nations. The differen|ces
among them are like the particular accents of dif|ferent
provinces, which are not di&s;tingui&s;hable, ex|cept
by an ear accu&s;tomed to them, and which com|monly
e&s;cape a foreigner.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly.</HI> We may often remark a wonderful mix|ture
of manners and characters in the &s;ame nation,
&s;peaking the &s;ame language, and &s;ubject to the &s;ame
government: And in this particular, the ENGLISH
are the mo&s;t remarkable of any people, that ever were
in the world. Nor is this to be a&s;cribed to the mu|tability
and uncertainty of their climate, or to any
other <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es; &s;ince all the&s;e cau&s;es take place
in their neighbouring kingdom of SCOTLAND, with|out
having the &s;ame effect. Where the government
of a nation is altogether republican, it is apt to beget
a particular &s;et of manners. Where it is altogether
monarchical, it is more apt to have the &s;ame effect;
the imitation of &s;uperiors &s;preading the national
<PB N="336" REF="329">
manners fa&s;ter among the people. If the governing
part of a &s;tate con&s;i&s;ts altogether of merchants, &s;uch
as HOLLAND, their uniform way of life will fix their
character. If it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of nobles and landed
gentry, like GERMANY, FRANCE, and SPAIN, the
&s;ame effect follows. The genius of a particular &s;ect
or religion is al&s;o apt to mould the manners of a peo|ple.
But the ENGLISH government is a mixture of
monarchy, ari&s;tocracy, and democracy. The people
in authority are compo&s;ed of gentry and merchants.
All &s;ects of religion are to be found among them.
And the great liberty and independency, which they
enjoy, allows every one to di&s;play the manners pe|culiar
to him. Hence the ENGLISH, of any people
in the univer&s;e, have the lea&s;t of a national character;
unle&s;s this very &s;ingularity may &s;tand for &s;uch.</P>
<P>IF the characters of men depended on the air and
climate, the degrees of heat and cold &s;hould naturally
be expected to have a mighty influence; &s;ince no|thing
has a greater effect on all plants and irrational
animals. And indeed there is &s;ome rea&s;on to think,
that all the nations, which live beyond the polar cir|cles
or between the tropics, are inferior to the re&s;t of
the &s;pecies, and are utterly incapable of all the higher
attainments of the human mind. The poverty and
mi&s;ery of the northern inhabitants of the globe, and
the indolence of the &s;outhern from their few nece&s;|&s;ities,
may, perhaps, account for this remarkable dif|ference,
<PB N="337" REF="330">
without having recour&s;e to <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es.
This however is certain, that the characters of nations
are very promi&s;cuous in the temperate climates, and
that almo&s;t all the general ob&s;ervations, which have
been formed of the more &s;outhern or more northern
nations in the&s;e climates, are found to be uncertain
and fallacious<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I am apt to &s;u&s;pect the negroes, and in general all the other &s;pecies of men (for there are four or five different kinds) to be naturally inferior to the whites. There never was a civilized nation of any other complexion than white, nor even any indi|vidual eminent either in action or &s;peculation. No ingenious manufactures among&s;t them, no arts, no &s;ciences. On the other hand, the mo&s;t rude and barbarous of the whites, &s;uch as the ancient GERMANS, the pre&s;ent TARTARS, have &s;till &s;ome|thing eminent about them, in their valour, form of government, or &s;ome other particular. Such a uniform and con&s;tant differ|ence could not happen, in &s;o many countries and ages, if nature had not made an original di&s;tinction betwixt the&s;e breeds of men. Not to mention our colonies, there are NEGROE &s;laves di&s;per&s;ed all over EUROPE, of which none ever di&s;covered any &s;ymptoms of ingenuity; tho' low people, without education, will &s;tart up among&s;t us, and di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves in every pro|fe&s;&s;ion. In JAMAICA indeed they talk of one negroe as a man of parts and learning; but 'tis likely he is admired for very &s;lender accompli&s;hments, like a parrot, who &s;peaks a few words plainly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL we &s;ay, that the neighbourhood of the &s;un
inflames the imagination of men, and gives it a pe|culiar
&s;pirit and vivacity. The FRENCH, GREEKS,
<PB N="338" REF="331">
EGYPTIANS and PERSIANS are remarkable for gai|ety.
The SPANIARDS, TURKS and CHINESE are
noted for gravity and a &s;erious behaviour, without any
&s;uch difference of climate, as to produce this difference
of temper.</P>
<P>THE GREEKS and ROMANS, who called all other
nations barbarians, confined genius and a fine under|&s;tanding
to the more &s;outhern climates, and pronoun|ced
the northern nations incapable of all knowledge
and civility. But BRITAIN has produced as great
men, either for action or learning, as GREECE or
ITALY has to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>'TIS pretended, that the &s;entiments of men be|come
more delicate as the country approaches nearer
the &s;un; and that the ta&s;te of beauty and elegance re|ceives
proportionable improvements in every latitude;
as we may particularly ob&s;erve of the languages, of
which the more &s;outhern are &s;mooth and melodious,
the northern har&s;h and untuneable. But this ob&s;erv|ation
holds not univer&s;ally. The ARABIC is un|couth
and di&s;agreeable: The MUSCOVITE &s;oft and
mu&s;ical. Energy, &s;trengh, and &s;ometimes har&s;hne&s;s
form the character of the LATIN tongue: The ITA|LIAN
is the mo&s;t liquid, &s;mooth, and effeminate lan|guage,
which can po&s;&s;ibly be imagined. Every lan|guage
will depend &s;omewhat on the manners of the
people; but much more on that original &s;tock of
<PB N="339" REF="332">
words and &s;ounds, which they received from their an|ce&s;tors,
and which remain unchangeable, even while
their manners admit of the greate&s;t alterations. Who
can doubt, but the ENGLISH are at pre&s;ent a much
more polite and knowing people than the GREEKS
were for &s;everal ages after the &s;iege of TROY? Yet
there is no compari&s;on between the language of MIL|TON
and that of HOMER. Nay, the greater are the
alterations and improvements, which happen in the
manners of a people, the le&s;s can be expected in their
language. A few great and re&s;ined geniu&s;es will
communicate their ta&s;te and knowledge to a whole
people, and produce the greate&s;t improvements:
But they fix the tongue by their writings, and pre|vent,
in &s;ome degree, its farther changes.</P>
<P>LORD BACON has ob&s;erved, that the inhabitants of
the &s;outh are, in general, more ingenious than tho&s;e
of the north; but that, where the native of a cold
climate has genius, he ri&s;es to a higher pitch than can
be reached by the &s;outhern wits. This ob&s;ervation a
late writer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Dr. Berkeley: Minute philo&s;opher.</NOTE> confirms, by comparing the &s;outhern
wits to cucumbers, which are commonly all good of
their kind; but at be&s;t are an in&s;ipid fruit: While
the northern geniu&s;es are like melons, of which not
one in fifty is good; but when it is good, it has an
exqui&s;ite reli&s;h, I believe this remark may be allow|ed
ju&s;t, when confined to the EUROPEAN nations, and
<PB N="340" REF="333">
to the pre&s;ent age, or rather to the preceding one:
But then I think it may be accounted for from mo|ral
cau&s;es. All the &s;ciences and liberal arts have been
imported to us from the &s;outh; and 'tis ea&s;y to ima|gine,
that, in the fir&s;t ardor of application, when ex|cited
by emulation and by glory, the few, who were
addicted to them, would carry them to the greate&s;t
height, and &s;tretch every nerve, and every faculty, to
reach the pinnacle of perfection. Such illu&s;trious
examples &s;pread knowledge every where, and begot
an univer&s;al e&s;teem for the &s;ciences: After which,
'tis no wonder, that indu&s;try relaxes; while men
meet not with &s;uitable encouragement, nor arrive at
&s;uch di&s;tinction by their attainments. The univer&s;al
diffu&s;ion of learning among a people, and the intire
bani&s;hment of gro&s;s ignorauce and ru&s;ticity, is, there|fore,
&s;eldom attended with any remarkable perfection
in particular per&s;ons. It &s;eems to be taken for grant|ed
in the dialogue <HI>de Oratoribus,</HI> that knowledge
was much more common in VESPASIAN'S age than in
that of CICERO or AUGUSTUS. QUINCTILIAN
al&s;o complains of the profanation of learning, by its
becoming too vulgar. &startq;Formerly, &s;ays JUVENAL,
&s;cience was confined to GREECE and ITALY. Now
the whole world emulate ATHENS and ROME.
Eloquent GAUL has taught BRITAIN, knowing in
the laws. Even THULE entertains thoughts of
<PB N="341" REF="334">
hiring rhetoricians for its in$$ruction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>&startq;Sed Cantaber unde</L>
<L>Stoicus? antiqui prae&s;ertim aetate Metelli.</L>
<L>Nunc totus GRAIAS, no&s;tra&s;que habet orbis ATHENAS.</L>
<L>GALLIA cau&s;idicos docuit facunda BRITANNOS:</L>
<L>De conducendo loquitur jam rhetore THULE.&endq; Satyr. 15.</L></Q></NOTE>.&endq; This
&s;tate of learning is remarkable; becau&s;e JUVENAL is
him&s;elf the la&s;t of the ROMAN writers, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
any degree of genius. Tho&s;e, who &s;ucceeded, are
valued for nothing but the matters of fact, of which
they give us information. I hope the late conver&s;ion
of MUSCOVY to the &s;tudy of the &s;ciences will not
prove a like progno&s;tic to the pre&s;ent period of learn|ing.</P>
<P>CARDINAL BENTIVOGLIO gives the preference to
the northern nations above the &s;outhern with regard
to candour and &s;incerity; and mentions, on the one
hand, the SPANIARDS and ITALIANS, and on the
other, the FLEMISH and GERMANS. But I am apt
to think, that this has happened by accident. The
ancient ROMANS &s;eem to have been a candid &s;incere
people as are the modern TURKS. But if we mu&s;t
needs &s;uppo&s;e, that this event has ari&s;en from fixed
cau&s;es, we may only conclude from it, that all ex|tremes
are apt to concur, and are commonly attended
with the &s;ame con&s;equences. Treachery is the u&s;ual
concomitant of ignorance and barbari&s;m; and if civi|lized
<PB N="342" REF="335">
nations ever embrace &s;ubtle and crooked poli|tics,
'tis from an exce&s;s of re&s;inement, which makes
them di&s;dain the plain direct road to power and
glory.</P>
<P>MOST conque&s;ts have gone from north to &s;outh;
and hence it has been inferred, that the northern na|tions
po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;uperior degree of courage and fero|city.
But it would have been ju&s;ter to have &s;aid, that
mo&s;t conque&s;ts are made by poverty and want upon
plenty and riches. The SARACENS, leaving the de|&s;erts
of ARABIA, carried their conque&s;ts northwards
upon all the fertile provinces of the ROMAN empire;
and met the TURKS half way, who were coming
&s;outhwards from the de&s;erts of TARTARY.</P>
<P>AN eminent writer<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Sir WILLIA$ TEMPLE'S account of the Netherlands.</NOTE> has remarked, that all cou|ragious
animals are al&s;o carnivorous, and that greater
courage is to be expected in a people, &s;uch as the
ENGLISH, who&s;e food is &s;trong and hearty, than in
the half-&s;tarved commonalty of other countries. But
the SWEDE$, notwith&s;tanding their di&s;advantages in
this particular, are not inferior, in martial courage,
to any nation that ever was in the world.</P>
<P>IN general, we may ob&s;erve, that courage, of all
national qualities, is the mo&s;t precarious; becau&s;e it
<PB N="343" REF="336">
is exerted only at intervals, and by a few in every
nation; whereas indu&s;try, knowledge, civility, may
be of con&s;tant and univer&s;al u&s;e, and for &s;everal ages,
may become habitual to the whole people. If cou|rage
be pre&s;erved, it mu&s;t be by di&s;cipline, example,
and opinion. The tenth legion of CAESAR, and the
regiment of PICARDY in FRANCE were formed pro|mi&s;cuou&s;ly
from among the citizens; but having
once entertained a notion, that they were the be&s;t
troops in the &s;ervice, this very opinion really made
them &s;uch.</P>
<P>AS a proof how much courage depends on opinion,
we may ob&s;erve, that of the two chief tribes of the
GREEKS, the DORIANS, and IONIANS, the former
were always e&s;teemed, and always appeared more
brave and manly than the latter; tho' the colonies of
both the tribes were inter&s;per&s;ed and intermingled
thro' all the extent of GREEC$, the le&s;&s;er ASIA, SI|CILY,
ITALY, and the i&s;lands of the AEGEAN &s;ea.
The ATHENIANS were the only IONIANS that ever
had any reputation for valour or military atchieve|ments;
tho' even the&s;e were e&s;teemed inferior to the
LACEDEMONIANS, the brave&s;t of the DORIANS.</P>
<P>THE only ob&s;ervation, with regard to the differences
of men in different climates, on which we can re&s;t
any weight, is the vulgar one, that people in the
northern regions have a greater inclination to &s;trong
<PB N="344" REF="337">
liquors, and tho&s;e in the &s;outhern to love and wo|men.
One can a&s;&s;ign a very probable <HI>phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;e
for this difference. Wine and di&s;tilled &s;pirits warm
the frozen blood in the colder climates, and fortify
men again&s;t the injuries of the weather: As the ge|nial
heat of the fun in the countries expo&s;ed to his
beams, inflames the blood, and exalts the pa&s;&s;ion be|twixt
the &s;exes.</P>
<P>PERHAPS too, the matter may be accounted for
by <HI>moral</HI> cau&s;es. All &s;trong liquors are rarer in the
north, and con&s;equently are more coveted. DIO|DORUS
SICU$US<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> 5. The &s;ame author a&s;cribes taciturnity to that peo|ple; a new proof that national characters may alter very much. Taciturnity, as a national character, implies un&s;ociablene&s;s. ARISTOTEE in his Politics, book 2. chap. 9. fays that the GAULS are the only warlike nation, who are negligent of women.</NOTE> tells us, that the GAULS, in
his time, were great drunkards, and much addicted
to wine; chiefly, I &s;uppo&s;e, from its rarity and no|velty.
On the other hand, the heat in the &s;outhern
climates, obliging men and women to go half naked,
thereby renders their frequent commerce more dan|gerous,
and inflames their mutual pa&s;&s;ion. This
makes parents and hu&s;bands more jealous and re&s;erv|ed;
which &s;till farther inflames the pa&s;&s;ion. Not to
mention, that as women ripen &s;ooner in the &s;outhern
<PB N="345" REF="338">
regions, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve greater jealou&s;y and
care in their education; it being evident, that a girl
of twelve cannot po&s;&s;e&s;s equal di&s;cretion to govern this
pa&s;&s;ion, with one, who feels not its violence till &s;he
be &s;eventeen or eighteen.</P>
<P>PERHAPS too, the fact is fal&s;e, that nature has, ei|ther
from moral or phy&s;ical cau&s;es, di&s;tributed the&s;e
different inclinations to the different climates. The
ancient GREEKS, tho' born in a warm climate, &s;eem
to have been much addicted to the bottle; nor were
their parties of plea&s;ure any thing but matches of
drinking among the men, who pa&s;&s;ed their time alto|gether
apart from the fair &s;ex. Yet when ALEXAN|DER

ITALY few drink pure wine, except in the greate&s;t

nece&s;&s;ary, in order to recruit the &s;pirits, evaporated
by heat, as it is in SWEDEN, during the winter, in
order to warm the bodies congealed by the rigour of
the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>IF jealou&s;y be regarded as a proof of an amorous
di&s;po&s;ition, no people were more jealous than the
MUSCOVITES, before their communication with EU|ROPE
had &s;omewhat altered their manners in this
particular.</P>
<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing the fact true, that nature, by phy|&s;ical
principles, has regularly di&s;tributed the&s;e two
pa&s;&s;ions, the one to the northern, the other to the
&s;outhern regions; we can only infer, that the climate
may affect the gro&s;&s;er and more bodily organs of our
frame; not that it can work upon tho&s;e finer organs,
on which the operations of the mind and under&s;tand|ing
depend. And this is agreeable to the analogy of
nature. The races of animals never degenerate when
carefully tended; and hor&s;es, in particular, always
&s;how their blood in their &s;hape, &s;pirit, and &s;wiftne&s;s:
<PB N="347" REF="340">
But a coxcomb may beget a philo&s;pher, as a man of
virtue may leave a worthle&s;s progeny.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that
tho' the pa&s;&s;ion for liquor be much more brutal and
deba&s;ing than love, which, when properly managed,
is the &s;ource of all politene&s;s and re&s;inement; yet this
gives not &s;o great an advantage to the &s;outhern cli|mates,
as we may be apt, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to imagine.
When love goes beyond a certain pitch, it renders
men jealous, and cuts off the free intercour&s;e between
the &s;exes, on which the politene&s;s of a nation will al|ways
much depend. And if we would &s;ubtilize and
refine upon this point, we might ob&s;erve, that na|tions,
in very temperate climates, &s;tand the faire&s;t
chance for all &s;orts of improvement; their blood not
being &s;o inflamed as to render them jealous, and yet
being warm enough to make them &s;et a due value on
the charms and endowments of the fair &s;ex.</P>

<P>IT &s;eems an unaccountable plea&s;ure, which the
&s;pectators of a well wrote tragedy receive from
&s;orrow, terror, anxiety, and other pa&s;&s;ions, which are
in them&s;elves di&s;agreeable and unea&s;y. The more
they are touched and affected, the more are they de|lighted
with the &s;pectacle, and as &s;oon as the unea&s;y
pa&s;&s;ions cea&s;e to operate, the piece is at an end. One
&s;cene of full joy and contentment and &s;ecurity is the
utmo&s;t, that any compo&s;ition of this kind can bear;
and it is &s;ure always to be the concluding one. If in
the texture of the piece, there be interwoven any
&s;cenes of &s;atisfaction, they afford only faint gleams of
plea&s;ure, which are thrown in by way of variety, and
in order to plunge the actors into deeper di&s;tre&s;s, by
means of that contra&s;t and di&s;appointment. The
whole art of the poet is employed, in rouzing and
&s;upporting the compa&s;&s;ion and indignation, the anxi|ety
and re&s;entment of his audience. They are plea|&s;ed
<PB N="350" REF="342">
in proportion as they are afflicted, and never are
&s;o happy as when they employ tears, &s;obs, and crie$
to give vent to their &s;orrow, and relieve their heart,
&s;woln with the tendere&s;t &s;ympathy and compa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE few critics, who have had &s;ome tincture of
philo&s;ophy, have remarked this &s;ingular phaeno|menon,
and have endeavoured to account for it.</P>
<P>L'ABBE DUBOS, in his reflections on poetry and
painting, a&s;&s;erts, that nothing is in general &s;o di&s;a|greeable
to the mind as the languid, li&s;tle&s;s &s;tate of in|dolence,
into which it falls upon the removal of
every pa&s;&s;ion and occupation. To get rid of this
painful &s;ituation, it &s;eeks every amu&s;ement and pur|&s;uit;
bu&s;ine&s;s, gaming, &s;hows, executions; whatever
will rouze the pa&s;&s;ions, and take its attention from
it&s;elf. No matter what the pa&s;&s;ion is: Let it be di&s;|agreeable,
afflicting, melancholy, di&s;ordered; it is
&s;till better than that in&s;ipid languor, which ari&s;es from
perfect tranquillity and repo&s;e.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible not to admit this account, as being,
at lea&s;t, in part &s;atisfactory. You may ob&s;erve, when
there are &s;everal tables of gaming, that all the company
run to tho&s;e, where the deepe&s;t play is, even tho' they
find not there the be&s;t players. The view, or at
lea&s;t, imagination of high pa&s;&s;ions, ari&s;ing from great
lo&s;s or gain, affects the &s;pectators by &s;ympathy, gives
<PB N="351" REF="343">
them &s;ome touches of the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;erves
them for a momentary entertainment. It makes the
time pa&s;s the ea&s;ier with them, and is &s;ome relief to
that oppre&s;&s;ion, under which men commonly labour,
when left intirely to their own thoughts and medi|tations.</P>
<P>WE find, that common lyars always magnify, in
their narrations, all kinds of danger, pain, di&s;tre&s;s,
&s;ickne&s;s, deaths, murders, and cruelties; as well as
joy, beauty, mirth, and magnificence. It is an ab|&s;urd
&s;ecret, which they have for plea&s;ing their com|pany,
fixing their attention, and attaching them to
&s;uch marvellous relations, by the pa&s;&s;ions and emo|tions,
which they excite.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, a difficulty of applying to the
pre&s;ent &s;ubject, in its full extent, this &s;olution, how|ever
ingenious and &s;atisfactory it may appear. It is
certain, that the &s;ame object of di&s;tre&s;s, which plea&s;es
in a tragedy, were it really &s;et before us, would give
the mo&s;t unfeigned unea&s;ine&s;s; tho' it be then the
mo&s;t effectual cure of languor and indolence. Mon|&s;ieur
FONTENELLE &s;eems to have been &s;en&s;ible of this
difficulty; and accordingly attempts another &s;olution
of the phaenomenon; at lea&s;t makes &s;ome addition to
the theory above mentioned<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Reflexions &s;ur la poetique, &sect;. $36.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>&startq;PLEASURE and pain,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;which are two
&s;entiments &s;o different in them&s;elves, differ not &s;o
much in their cau&s;e. From the in&s;tance of tick|ling,
it appears, that the movement of plea&s;ure
pu&s;hed a little too far, becomes pain; and that
the movement of pain, a little moderated, be|comes
plea&s;ure. Hence it proceeds, that there is
&s;uch a thing as a &s;orrow, &s;oft and agreeable: It is a
pain weakened and dimini&s;hed. The heart likes
naturally to be moved and affected. Melancholy
objects &s;uit it, and even di&s;a&s;trous and &s;orrowful,
provided they are &s;oftened by &s;ome circum&s;tance.
It is certain, that on the theatre, the repre&s;entation
has almo&s;t the effect of reality; but yet it has not
altogether that effect. However we may be hur|ried
away by the &s;pectacle; whatever dominion
the &s;en&s;es and imagination may u&s;urp over the rea|&s;on,
there &s;till lurks at the bottom a certain idea
of fal&s;hood in the whole of what we &s;ee. This
idea, tho' weak and di&s;gui&s;ed, &s;uffices to dimini&s;h
the pain which we &s;uffer from the misfortunes of
tho&s;e whom we love, and to reduce that affliction
to &s;uch a pitch as converts it into a plea&s;ure. We
weep for the misfortune of a hero, to whom we
are attached. In the &s;ame in&s;tant we comfort our|&s;elves,
by reflecting, that it is nothing but a fiction:
And it is preci&s;ely that mixture of &s;entiments, which
compo&s;es an agreeable &s;orrow, and tears that de|light
us. But as that affliction, which is cau&s;ed by
<PB N="353" REF="345">
exterior and &s;en&s;ible objects, is &s;tronger than the
con&s;olation which ari&s;es from an internal reflection,
they are the effects and &s;ymptoms of &s;orrow, which
ought to prevail in the compo&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS &s;olution &s;eems ju&s;t and convincing; but per|haps
it wants &s;till &s;ome new addition, in order to
make it an&s;wer fully the phaenomenon, which we
here examine. All the pa&s;&s;ions, excited by eloquence,
are agreeable in the highe&s;t degree, as well as tho&s;e
which are moved by painting and the theatre. The
epilogues of CICERO are, on this account chiefly, the
delight of every reader of ta&s;te; and it is difficult to
read &s;ome of them without the deepe&s;t &s;ympathy and
&s;orrow. His merit as an orator, no doubt, depends
much on his &s;ucce&s;s in this particular. When he had
rai&s;ed tears in his judges and all his audience, they
were then the mo&s;t highly delighted, and expre&s;&s;ed
the greate&s;t &s;atisfaction with the pleader. The pa|thetic
de&s;cription of the butchery made by VERRES of
the SICILIAN captains is a ma&s;ter-piece of this kind:
But I believe none will affirm, that the being pre&s;ent
at a melancholy &s;cene of that nature would afford any
entertainment. Neither is the &s;orrow here &s;oftened
by fiction: For the audience were convinced of the
reality of every circum&s;tance. What is it then,
which in this ca&s;e rai&s;es a plea&s;ure from the bo&s;om of
unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;o to &s;peak; and a plea&s;ure, which &s;till
<PB N="354" REF="346">
retains all the features and outward &s;ymptoms of di&s;|tre&s;s
and &s;orrow?</P>
<P>I ANSWER: This extrordinary effect proceeds from
that very eloquence, with which the melancholy
&s;cene is repre&s;ented. The genius required to paint
objects in a lively manner, the art employed in col|lecting
all the pathetic circum&s;tances, the judgment
di&s;played in di&s;po&s;ing them; the exerci&s;e, I &s;ay, of
the&s;e noble talents, together with the force of expre&s;|&s;ion,
and beauty of oratorial numbers, diffu&s;e the
highe&s;t &s;atisfaction on the audience, and excite the
mo&s;t delightful movements. By this means, the un|ea&s;ine&s;s
of the melancholy pa&s;&s;ions is not only over|powered
and effaced by &s;omething &s;tronger of an op|po&s;ite
kind; but the whole movement of tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ions
is converted into plea&s;ure, and &s;wells the delight
which the eloquence rai&s;es in us. The &s;ame force of
oratory, employed on an unintere&s;ting &s;ubject, would
not plea&s;e half &s;o much, or rather would appear alto|gether
ridiculous; and the mind, being left in ab&s;o|lute
calmne&s;s and indifference, would reli&s;h none of
tho&s;e beauties of imagination or expre&s;&s;ion, which, if
joined to pa&s;&s;ion, give it &s;uch exqui&s;ite entertainment.
The impul&s;e or vehemence, ari&s;ing from &s;orrow, com|pa&s;&s;ion,
indignation, receives a new direction from
the &s;entiments of beauty. The latter, being the
predominant emotion, &s;eize the whole mind, and con|vert
the former into them&s;elves, or at lea&s;t, tincture
<PB N="355" REF="347">
them &s;o &s;trongly as totally to alter their nature: And
the &s;oul, being, at the &s;ame time, rouzed by pa&s;&s;ion,
and charmed by eloquence, feels on the whole a
&s;trong movement, which is altogether delightful.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle takes place in tragedy; with
this addition, that tragedy is an imitation, and imi|tation
is always of it&s;elf agreeable. This circum|&s;tance
&s;erves &s;till farther to &s;mooth the motions of
pa&s;&s;ion, and convert the whole &s;eeling into one uni|form
and &s;trong enjoyment. Objects of the greate&s;t
terror and di&s;tre&s;s plea&s;e in painting, and plea&s;e more
than the mo&s;t beautiful objects, that appear calm and
indifferent<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Painters make no &s;cruple of repre&s;enting di&s;tre&s;s and &s;orrow as well as any other pa&s;&s;ion: But they &s;eem not to dwell &s;o much on the&s;e melancholy affections as the poets, who, tho' they copy every emotion of the human brea&s;t, yet pa&s;s very quick|ly over the agreeable &s;entiments. A painter repre&s;ents only one in&s;tant; and if that be pa&s;&s;ionate enough, it is &s;ure to affect and delight the &s;pectator: But nothing can furni&s;h to the poet a variety of &s;cenes and incidents and &s;entiments, except di&s;tre&s;s, terror, or anxiety. Compleat joy and $atisfaction is attended with &s;ecurity, and leaves no farther room for action.</NOTE>. The affection, rouzing the mind, ex|cites
a large &s;tock of &s;pirit and vehemence; which is
all transformed into plea&s;ure by the force of the pre|vailing
movement. It is thus the fiction of tragedy
&s;oftens the pa&s;&s;ion, by an infu&s;ion of a new feeling,
<PB N="356" REF="348">
not merely by weakening or dimini&s;hing the &s;orrow.
You may be degrees weaken a real &s;orrow, till it to|tally
di&s;appears; yet in none of its gradations will it
ever give plea&s;ure; except, perhaps, by accident, to
a man &s;unk under lethargic indolence, whom it rou|zes
from that languid &s;tate.</P>
<P>TO confirm this theory, it will be &s;ufficient to pro|duce
other in&s;tances, where the &s;ubordinate move|ment
is converted into the predominant, and gives
force to it, tho' of a different, and even &s;ometimes
tho' of a contrary nature.</P>
<P>NOVELTY naturally excites the mind, and attracts
our attention; and the movements, which it cau&s;es,
are always converted into any pa&s;&s;ion, belonging to
the object, and join their force to it. Whether an
event excites joy or &s;orrow, pride or &s;hame, anger or
good-will, it is &s;ure to produce a &s;tronger affection,
when new or unu&s;ual. And tho' novelty of it&s;elf be
agreeable, it enforces the painful, as well as agreeable
pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>HAD you any intention to move a per&s;on extreme|ly
by the narration of any event, the be&s;t method of
increa&s;ing its effect would be artfully to delay inform|ing
him of it, and fir&s;t excite his curio&s;ity and impa|tience
before you let him into the &s;ecret. This is the
artifice practi&s;ed by IAGO in the famous &s;cene of
<PB N="357" REF="349">
SHAKESPEARE; and every &s;pectator is &s;en&s;ible, that
OTHELLO's jealou&s;y acquires additional force from
his preceding impatience, and that the &s;ubordinate
pa&s;&s;ion is here readily transformed into the predo|minant.</P>
<P>DIFFICULTIES increa&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of every kind;
and by rou&s;ing our attention, and exciting our active
powers, they produce an emotion, which nouri&s;hes
the prevailing affection.</P>
<P>PARENTS commonly love that child mo&s;t, who&s;e
&s;ickly infirm frame of body has occa&s;ioned them the
greate&s;t pains, trouble, and anxiety, in rearing him.
The agreeable &s;entiment of affection here acquires
force from &s;entiments of unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTHING endears &s;o much a friend as &s;orrow for
his death. The plea&s;ure of his company has not &s;o
powerful an influence.</P>
<P>JEALOUSY is a painful pa&s;&s;ion; yet, without &s;ome
&s;hare of it, the agreeable affection of love has diffi|culty
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in its full force and violence. Ab&s;ence
is al&s;o a great &s;ource of complaint among&s;t lovers,
and gives them the greate&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s: Yet nothing
is more favourable to their mutual pa&s;&s;ion than &s;hort
intervals of that kind. And if long intervals be per|nicious,
it is only becau&s;e, thro' time, men are ac|cu&s;tomed

<P>THESE in&s;tances (and many more might be col|lected)
are &s;ufficient to afford us &s;ome in&s;ight into the
<PB N="359" REF="351">
analogy of nature, and to &s;how us, that the plea&s;ure,
which poets, orators, and mu&s;icians give us, by ex|citing,
grief, &s;orrow, indignation, compa&s;&s;ion, is not
&s;o extraordinary nor paradoxical, as it may at fir&s;t

of expre&s;&s;ion, the power of numbers, the charms of
imitation; all the&s;e are naturally, of them&s;elves, de|lightful
to the mind: And when the object pre&s;ented
lays al&s;o hold of &s;ome affection, the plea&s;ure &s;till ri&s;es
upon us, by the conver&s;ion of this &s;ubordinate move|ment
into that which is predominant. The pa&s;&s;ion,
tho', perhaps, naturally, and when excited by the
&s;imple appearance of a real object, it may be painful;
yet is &s;o &s;moothed, and &s;oftened, and mollified, when
rai&s;ed by the finer arts, that it affords the highe&s;t en|tertainment.</P>

if the movements of the imagination be not predo|minant

is converted into the latter, and &s;till farther increa&s;es

vehemence of CICERO: So al&s;o did his pain and
unea&s;ine&s;s. The&s;e former pa&s;&s;ions were too &s;trong
for the plea&s;ure ari&s;ing from the beauties of elocu|tion;
and operated, tho' from the &s;ame principle,
yet in a contrary manner, to the &s;ympathy, compa&s;|&s;ion,
and indignation of the audience.</P>
<P>LORD CLARENDON, when he approaches the ca|ta&s;trophe

mu&s;t then become infinitely di&s;agreeable; and
he hurries over the King's death, without giving us
one circum&s;tance of it. He con&s;iders it as too horrid
a &s;cene to be contemplated with any &s;atisfaction, or
even without the utmo&s;t pain and aver&s;ion. He
him&s;elf, as well as the readers of that age, were too
deeply concerned in the events, and felt a pain from
&s;ubjects, which an hi&s;torian and a reader of another
age would regard as the mo&s;t pathetic and mo&s;t in|tere&s;ting,
and, by con&s;equence, the mo&s;t agreeable.</P>
<P>AN action, repre&s;ented in tragedy, may be too
bloody and atrocious. It may excite &s;uch move|ments
of horror as will not &s;often into plea&s;ure; and
the greate&s;t energy of expre&s;&s;ion, be&s;towed on de&s;crip|tions
<PB N="361" REF="353">
of that nature, &s;erves only to augment our un|ea&s;ine&s;s.
Such is that action, repre&s;ented in the
<HI>Ambitious Stepmother,</HI> where a venerable old man,
rai&s;ed to the height of fury and de&s;pair, ru&s;hes again&s;t
a pillar, and &s;triking his head upon it, be&s;mears it all
over with mingled brains and gore. The ENGLISH
theatre abounds too much with &s;uch images.</P>
<P>EVEN the common &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion re|quire
to be &s;oftened by &s;ome agreeable affection, in
order to give a thorough &s;atisfaction to the audience.
The mere &s;uffering of plaintive virtue, under the tri|umphant
tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of vice, forms a
di&s;agreeable &s;pectacle, and is carefully avoided by all
ma&s;ters of the theatre. In order to di&s;mi&s;s, the audi|ence
with intire &s;atisfaction and contentment, the vir|tue
mu&s;t either convert it&s;elf into a noble courageous
de&s;pair, or the vice receive its proper puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>MOST painters appear in this light to have been
very unhappy in their &s;ubjects. As they wrought for
churches and convents, they have chiefly repre&s;ented

<P>THE great variety of Ta&s;tes, as well as of opini|ons,
which prevail in the world, is too obvious
not to have fallen under every one's ob&s;ervation. Men
of the mo&s;t confined knowledge are able to remark a
difference in the narrow circle of their acquaintance,
even where the per&s;ons have been educated under the
&s;ame government, and have early imbibed the &s;ame
prejudices. But tho&s;e who can enlarge their view to
contemplate di&s;tant nations and remote ages, are &s;till
more &s;urprized at the great incon&s;i&s;tence and contra|diction.
We are apt to call <HI>barbarous</HI> whatever de|parts
widely from our own ta&s;te and apprehen&s;ion:
But &s;oon find the epithet of reproach retorted on
us. And the highe&s;t arrogance and &s;elf-conceit is
at la&s;t &s;tartled, on ob&s;erving an equal a&s;&s;urance on all
&s;ides, and &s;cruples, amid&s;t &s;uch a conte&s;t of &s;entiments,
to pronounce po&s;itively in its own favour.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="356">
As this variety of ta&s;te is obvious to the mo&s;t care|le&s;s
enquirer; &s;o will it be found, on examination,
to be &s;till greater in reality than in appearance. The
&s;entiments of men often differ with regard to beauty
and deformity of all kinds, even while their general
di&s;cour&s;e is the &s;ame. There are certain terms in
every language, which import blame, and others
prai&s;e; and all men, who u&s;e the &s;ame tongue, mu&s;t
agree in their application of them. Every voice is
united in applauding elegance, propriety, &s;implicity,
&s;pirit in writing; and in blaming &s;u&s;tian, affectation,
coldne&s;s, and a fal&s;e brilliancy: But when critics come
to particulars, this &s;eeming unanimity vani&s;hes; and
it is found, that they had affixed a very different
meaning to their expre&s;&s;ions. In all matters of opi|nion
and &s;cience, the ca&s;e is oppo&s;ite: The difference
among men is there oftner found to lie in generals
than in particulars; and to be le&s;s in reality than in
appearance. An explication of the terms commonly
ends the controver&s;y; and the di&s;putants are &s;urprized
to find, that they had been quarrelling, while at bot|tom
they agreed in their judgment.</P>
<P>THOSE who found morality on &s;entiment, more
than on rea&s;on, are inclined to comprehend ethics un|der
the former ob&s;ervation, and to &s;uppo&s;e, that in all
que&s;tions, which regard conduct and manners, the
difference among men is really greater than at fir&s;t
&s;ight it appears. It is indeed obvious, that writers of
<PB N="365" REF="357">
all nations and all ages concur in applauding ju&s;tice,
humanity, magnanimity, prudence, veracity; and in
blaming the oppo&s;ite qualities. Even poets and other
authors, who&s;e compo&s;itions are chiefly calculated to
plea&s;e the imagination, are yet found, from HOMER
down to FENELON, to inculcate the &s;ame moral pre|cepts,
and to be&s;tow their applau&s;e and blame on the
&s;ame virtues and vices. This great unanimity is u&s;u|ally
a&s;cribed to the influence of plain rea&s;on; which,
in all the&s;e ca&s;es, maintains &s;imilar &s;entiments in all
men, and prevents tho&s;e controver&s;ies, to which the
ab&s;tract &s;ciences are &s;o much expo&s;ed. So far as the
unanimity is real, the account may be admitted as
&s;atisfactory: But it mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed, that &s;ome
part of the &s;eeming harmony in morals may be ac|counted
for from the very nature of language. The
word, <HI>virtu$,</HI> with its equivalent in every tongue,
implies prai&s;e; as that of <HI>vice</HI> does blame: And no
one, without the mo&s;t obvious and gro&s;&s;e&s;t impropri|ety,
could affix reproach to a term, which in general
u&s;e is under&s;tood in a good &s;en&s;e; or be&s;tow applau&s;e,
where the idiom requires di&s;approbation. HOMER's
general precepts, where he delivers any &s;uch, will
never be controveted; but it is very obvious, that
when he draws particular pictures of manners, and
repre&s;ents heroi&s;m in ACHILLES and prudence in
ULYSSES, he intermixes a much greater degree of
ferocity in the former, and of cunning and fraud in
the latter, than FENELON would admit of. The &s;age
<PB N="366" REF="358">
ULYSSES in the GREEK poet &s;eems to delight in
lies and fictions, and often employs them without
any nece&s;&s;ity or even advantage: But his more &s;$ru|pulous
&s;on in the FRENCH epic writer expo&s;es him|&s;elf
to the mo&s;t imminent perils, rather than depart
from the exacte&s;t line of truth and veracity.</P>
<P>THE admirers and followers of the ALCORAN in|&s;i&s;t
very much on the excellent moral precepts, which
are inter&s;per&s;ed throughout that wild performance.
But it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the ARABIC words,
which corre&s;pond to the ENGLISH, equity, ju&s;tice,
temperance, meekne&s;s, charity, were &s;uch as, from
the con&s;tant u&s;e of that tongue, mu&s;t always be taken
in a good &s;en&s;e; and it would have argued the great|e&s;t
ignorance, not of morals, but of language, to
have mentioned them with any epithets, be&s;ides tho&s;e
of applau&s;e and approbation. But would we know,
whether the pretended prophet had really attained a
ju&s;t &s;entiment of morals? Let us attend to his nar|ration;
and we &s;hall &s;oon find, that he be&s;tows prai&s;e
on &s;uch in&s;tances of treachery, inhumanity, cruelty,
revenge, bigotry, as are utterly incompatible with
civilized &s;ociety. No &s;teady rule of right &s;eems there
to be attended to; and every action is blamed or
prai&s;ed, &s;o far only as it is beneficial or hurtful to the
true believers.</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="359">
THE merit of delivering true general precepts in
ethics is indeed very &s;mall. Whoever recommends
any moral virtues, really does no more than is implied
in the terms them&s;elves. The people, who invented
the word <HI>charity,</HI> and u&s;ed it in a good &s;en&s;e, incul|cated
more clearly and much more efficaciou&s;ly, the
precept, <HI>be charitable,</HI> than any pretended legi&s;lator
or prophet, who &s;hould in&s;ert &s;uch a <HI>maxim</HI> in his writ|ings.
Of all expre&s;&s;ions, tho&s;e, which, together with
their other meaning, imply a degree either of blame
or approbation, are the lea&s;t liable to be perverted or
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>IT is natural for us to &s;eek a <HI>Standard of Ta&s;te;</HI> a
rule, by which the various &s;entiments of men may be
reconciled; or at lea&s;t, a deci&s;ion afforded, confirm|ing
one &s;entiment, and condemning another.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy, which cuts off
all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in &s;uch an attempt, and repre&s;ents
the impo&s;&s;ibility of ever attaining any &s;tandard of
ta&s;te. The difference, it is &s;aid, is very wide between
judgment and &s;entiment. All &s;entiment is right; be|cau&s;e
&s;entiment has a reference to nothing beyond it|&s;elf,
and is always real, wherever a man is con&s;cious
of it. But all determinations of the under&s;tanding
are not right; becau&s;e they have a reference to &s;ome|thing
beyond them&s;elves, to wit, real matter of fact;
and are not always conformable to that &s;tandard.
<PB N="368" REF="360">
Among a thou&s;and different opinions which dif|ferent
men may entertain of the &s;ame &s;ubject,
there is one, and but one, that is ju&s;t and true;
and the only difficulty is to fix and a&s;certain it.
On the contrary, a thou&s;and different &s;entiments,
excited by the &s;ame object, are all right: Becau&s;e
no &s;entiment repre&s;ents what is really in the ob|ject.
It only marks a certain conformity or rela|tion
between the object and the organs or faculties of
the mind; and if that conformity did not really ex|i&s;t,
the &s;entiment could never po&s;&s;ibly have a being.
Beauty is no quality in things them&s;elves: It exi&s;ts
merely in the mind which contemplates them; and
each mind perceives a different beauty. One per&s;on
may even perceive deformity, where another is &s;en|&s;ible
of beauty; and every individual ought to acqui|e&s;ce
in his own &s;entiment, without pretending to re|gulate
tho&s;e of others. To &s;eek the real beauty, or
real deformity is as fruitle&s;s an enquiry, as to pretend
to a&s;certain the real &s;weet or real bitter. According
to the di&s;po&s;ition of the organs, the &s;ame object may
be both &s;weet and bitter; and the proverb has ju&s;tly
determined it to be fruitle&s;s to di&s;pute concerning
ta&s;tes. It is very natural, and even quite nece&s;&s;ary,
to extend this axiom to mental, as well as bodily
ta&s;te; and thus common &s;en&s;e, which is &s;o often at
variance with philo&s;ophy, e&s;pecially with the &s;cep|tical
kind, is &s;ound, in one in&s;tance at lea&s;t, to agree
in pronouncing the &s;ame deci&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="361">
BUT though this axiom, by pa&s;&s;ing into a proverb,
&s;eems to have attained the &s;anction of common &s;en&s;e;
there is certainly a &s;pecies of common &s;en&s;e which op|po&s;es
it, or at lea&s;t &s;erves to modify and re&s;train
it. Whoever would a&s;&s;ert an equality of genius and
elegance between OGILBY and MILTON, or BUNYAN
and ADDISON, would be thought to defend no le&s;s an
extravagance, than if he had maintained a molehill
to be as high as TENERIFFE, or a pond as exten&s;ive
as the ocean. Tho' there may be found per&s;ons, who
give the preference to the former authors; no one
pays attention to &s;uch a ta&s;te; and we pronounce
without &s;cruple the &s;entiment of the&s;e pretended cri|tics
to be ab&s;urd and ridiculous. The principle of the
natural equality of ta&s;tes is then totally forgot; and
while we admit of it on &s;ome occa&s;ions, where the
objects &s;eem near an equality, it appears an extrava|gant
paradox, or rather a palpable ab&s;urdity, where
objects &s;o di&s;proportioned are compared together.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that none of the rules of compo&s;ition
are fixed by rea&s;onings <HI>a priori,</HI> or can be e&s;teemed
ab&s;tract conclu&s;ions of the under&s;tanding, from com|paring
tho&s;e habitudes and relations of ideas, which
are eternal and immutable. Their foundation is the
&s;ame with that of all the practical &s;ciences, experi|ence;
nor are they any thing but general ob&s;erva|tions,
concerning what has been univer&s;ally found to
plea&s;e in all countries and in all ages. Many of the
<PB N="370" REF="362">
beauties of poetry and even of eloquence are founded
on fal&s;hood and fiction, on hyperboles, metaphors, and
an abu&s;e or perver&s;ion of expre&s;&s;ions from their natu|ral
meaning. To check the &s;allies of the imagination,
and to reduce every expre&s;&s;ion to geometrical truth
and exactne&s;s, would be the mo&s;t contrary to the laws
of critici&s;m; becau&s;e it would produce a work, which,
by univer&s;al experience, has been found the mo&s;t in|&s;ipid
and di&s;agreeable. But tho' poetry can never &s;ub|mit
to exact truth, it mu&s;t be confined by rules of art,
di&s;covered to the author either by genius or ob&s;erva|tion.
If &s;ome negligent or irregular writers have
plea&s;ed, they have not plea&s;ed by their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
of rule or order, but in &s;pite of the&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions:
They have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed other beauties, which were con|&s;ormable
to ju&s;t critici&s;m; and the force of the&s;e beau|ties
has been able to overpower cen&s;ure, and give the
mind a &s;atisfaction &s;uperior to the di&s;gu&s;t ari&s;ing from
the blemi&s;hes. ARIOSTO plea&s;es; but not by his
mon&s;trous and improbable fictions, by his bizarre
mixture of the &s;erious and comic &s;tyles, by the want
of coherence in his &s;tories, or by the continual inter|ruptions
of his narration. He charms by the force and
clearne&s;s of his expre&s;&s;ion, by the readine&s;s and vari|ety
of his inventions, and by his natural pictures of
the pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the gay and amorous
kind: And however his faults may dimini&s;h our &s;ati&s;|faction,
they are not able entirely to de&s;troy it. Did
our plea&s;ure really ari&s;e from tho&s;e parts of his poem,
<PB N="371" REF="363">
which we denominate faults, this would be no objec|tion
to critici&s;m in general: It would only be an ob|jection
to tho&s;e particular rules of critici&s;m, which
would e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch circum&s;tances to be faults, and
would repre&s;ent them as univer&s;ally blameable. If
they are found to plea&s;e, they cannot be faults; let
the plea&s;ure, which they produce, be ever &s;o unex|pected
and unaccountable.</P>
<P>BUT though all the general rules of art are founded
only on experience and on the ob&s;ervation of the com|mon
&s;entiments of human nature, we mu&s;t not ima|gine,
that, on every occa&s;ion, the feelings of men
will be conformable to the&s;e rules. Tho&s;e finer emo|tions
of the mind are of a very tender and delicate
nature, and require the concurrence of many favour|able
circum&s;tances to make them play with facility
and exactne&s;s, according to their general and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed
principles. The lea&s;t exterior hindrance to &s;uch
&s;mall &s;prings, or the lea&s;t internal di&s;order, di&s;turbs
their motion, and confounds the operation of the
whole machine. When we would make an experi|ment
of this nature, and would try the force of any
beauty or deformity, we mu&s;t choo&s;e with care a pro|per
time and place, and bring the fancy to a &s;uitable
&s;ituation and di&s;po&s;ition. A perfect &s;erenity of mind,
a recollection of thought, a due attention to the ob|ject;
if any of the&s;e circum&s;tances be wanting our
<PB N="372" REF="364">
experiment will be fallacious, and we &s;hall be unable
to judge of the catholic and univer&s;al beauty. The
relation, which nature has placed between the form
and the &s;entiment, will at lea&s;t be more ob&s;cure; and
it will require greater accuracy to trace and di&s;cern it.
We &s;hall be able to a&s;certain its influence not &s;o much
from the operation of each particular beauty, as from
the durable admiration, which attends tho&s;e works,
that have &s;urvived all the caprices of mode and fa&s;hion,
all the mi&s;takes of ignorance and envy.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame HOMER, who plea&s;ed at ATHENS and
ROME two thou&s;and years ago, is &s;till admired at
PARIS and at LONDON. All the changes of climate,
government, religion, and language, have not been
able to ob&s;cure his glory. Authority or prejudice
may give a temporary vogue to a bad poet or orator;
but his reputation will never be durable or general.
When his compo&s;itions are examined by po&s;terity or
by foreigners, the enchantment is di&s;&s;ipated, and his
faults appear in their true colours. On the contrary,
a real genius, the longer his works endure, and the
more wide they are &s;pread, the more &s;incere is the admi|ration
which he meets with. Envy and jealou&s;y have
too much place in a narrow circle; and even familiar
acquaintance with his per&s;on may dimini&s;h the ap|plau&s;e
due to his performances: But when the&s;e ob|&s;tructions
are removed, the beauties, which are natu|rally
fitted to excite agreeable &s;entiments, immedi|ately
<PB N="373" REF="365">
di&s;play their energy; and while the world en|dures,
they maintain their authority over the minds
of men.</P>
<P>IT appears then, that amid&s;t all the variety and
caprice of ta&s;te, there are certain general principles
of approbation or blame, who&s;e influence a careful
eye may trace in all operations of the mind. Some
particular forms or qualities, from the original &s;truc|ture
of the internal fabric, are culculated to plea&s;e,
and others to di&s;plea&s;e; and if they fail of their ef|fect
in any particular in&s;tance, it is from &s;ome appa|rent
defect or imperfection in the organ. A man in
a fever would not in&s;i&s;t on his palate as able to decide
concerning flavours; nor would one, affected with the
jaundice, pretend to give a verdict with regard to
colours. In each creature, there is a &s;ound and a de|fective
&s;tate; and the former alone can be &s;uppo&s;ed to
afford us a true &s;tandard of ta&s;te and &s;entiment. If
in the &s;ound &s;tate of the organs, there be an entire or
a con&s;iderable uniformity of &s;entiment among men,
we may thence derive an idea of the perfect beauty;
in like manner as the appearance of objects in day|light
to the eye of a man in health is denominated
their true and real colour, even while colour is allowed
to be merely a phanta&s;m of the &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>MANY and frequent are the defects in the internal
organs, which prevent or weaken the influence of
<PB N="374" REF="366">
tho&s;e general principles, on which depends our &s;enti|ment
of beauty or deformity. Tho' &s;ome objects, by
the &s;tructure of the mind, be naturally calculated to
give plea&s;ure, it is not to be expected, that in every
individual the plea&s;ure will be equally felt. Particu|lar
incidents and &s;ituations occur, which either throw
a fal&s;e light on the objects, or hinder the true from
conveying to the imagination the proper &s;entiment
and perception.</P>
<P>ONE obvious cau&s;e, why many feel not the proper
&s;entiment of beauty, is the want of that <HI>delicacy</HI> of
imagination, which is requi&s;ite to convey a &s;en&s;ibility
of tho&s;e finer emotions. This delicacy every one
pretends to: Every one talks of it; and would re|duce
every kind of ta&s;te or &s;entiment to its &s;tandard.
But as our intention in this di&s;&s;ertation is to mingle
&s;ome light of the under&s;tanding with the feelings of
&s;entiment, it will be proper to give a more accurate
definition of delicacy, than has hitherto been at|tempted.
And not to draw our philo&s;ophy from
too profound a &s;ource, we &s;hall have recour&s;e to a
noted &s;tory in Don QUIXOTE.</P>
<P>'TIS with good rea&s;on, &s;ays SANCHO to the &s;quire
with the great no&s;e, that I pretend to have a judg|ment
in wine: This is a quality hereditary in our fa|mily.
Two of my kin&s;men were once called to give
their opinion of a hog&s;head, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to
<PB N="375" REF="367">
be excellent, being old and of a good vintage. One
of them ta&s;tes it; con&s;iders it, and after mature re|flection
pronounces the wine to be good, were it not
for a &s;mall ta&s;te of leather, which he perceived in it.
The other, after u&s;ing the &s;ame precautions, gives al|&s;o
his verdict in favour of the wine; but with the re|&s;erve
of a ta&s;te of iron, which he could ea&s;ily di&s;|tingui&s;h.
You cannot imagine how much they were
both ridiculed for their judgment. But who laughed
in the end? On emptying the hog&s;head, there was
found at the bottom, an old key with a leathern thong
tied to it.</P>
<P>THE great re&s;emblance between mental and bodily
ta&s;te will ea&s;ily teach us to apply this &s;tory. Tho' it
be certain, that beauty and deformity, no more than
&s;weet and bitter, are not qualities in objects, but be|long
entirely to the &s;entiment, internal or external;
it mu&s;t be allowed, that there are certain qualities in
objects, which are fitted by nature to produce tho&s;e
particular feelings. Now as the&s;e qualities may be
found in a &s;mall degree or may be mixed and con|founded
with each other, it often happens, that the
ta&s;te is not affected with &s;uch minute qualities, or is
not able to di&s;tingui&s;h all the particular flavours, amid&s;t
the di&s;order, in which they are pre&s;ented. Where
the organs are &s;o fine, as to allow nothing to e&s;cape
them; and at the &s;ame &s;o exact as to perceive every
ingredient in the compo&s;ition: This we call delicacy
<PB N="376" REF="368">
of ta&s;te, whether we employ the&s;e terms in the na|tural
or metaphorical &s;en&s;e. Here then the general
rules of beauty are of u&s;e; being drawn from e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
models, and from the ob&s;ervation of what
plea&s;es or di&s;plea&s;es, when pre&s;ented &s;ingly and in a
high degree: And if the &s;ame qualities, in a con|tinued
compo&s;ition and in a &s;maller degree, affect not
the organs with a &s;en&s;ible delight or unea&s;ine&s;s, we
exclude the per&s;on from all preten&s;ions to this deli|cacy.
To produce the&s;e general rules or avowed
patterns of compo&s;ition is like finding the key with the
leathern thong; which ju&s;tified the verdict of SAN|CHO's
kin&s;men, and confounded tho&s;e pretended judges
who had condemned them. Tho' the hog&s;head had
never been emptied, the ta&s;te of the one was &s;till
equally delicate, and that of the other equally dull
and languid: But it would have been more difficult
to have proved the &s;uperiority of the former, to the
conviction of every by &s;tander. In like manner, tho'
the beauties of writing had never been methodized,
or reduced to general principls; tho' no excellent
models had ever been acknowledged; the different de|grees
of ta&s;te would &s;till have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, and the judg|ment
of one man been pre&s;erable to that of another;
but it would not have been &s;o ea&s;y to &s;ilence the bad
critic, who might always in&s;i&s;t upon his particular &s;en|timent,
and refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to his antagoni&s;t. But when
we &s;how him an avowed principle of art; when we il|lu&s;trate
this principle by examples, who&s;e operation, from
his own particular ta&s;te, he acknowledges to be conform|able
<PB N="377" REF="369">
to the principle; when we prove, that the &s;ame
principle may be applied to the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, where
he did not perceive nor feel its influence: He mu&s;t
conclude, upon the whole, that the fault lies in him|&s;elf,
and that he wants the delicacy, which is requi&s;ite
to make him &s;en&s;ible of every beauty and every ble|mi&s;h,
in any compo&s;ition or di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>'TIS acknowledged to be the perfection of every
&s;en&s;e or faculty, to perceive with exactne&s;s its mo&s;t
minute objects, and allow nothing to e&s;cape its notice
and ob&s;ervation. The &s;maller the objects are, which
become &s;en&s;ible to the eye, the finer is that organ,
and the more elaborate its make and compo&s;ition. A
good palate is not tried by &s;trong flavours; but by a
mixture of &s;mall ingredients, where we are &s;till &s;en&s;|ible
of each part, notwith&s;tanding its minutene&s;s and
its confu&s;ion with the re&s;t. In like manner, a quick
and acute perception of beauty and deformity mu&s;t be
the perfection of our mental ta&s;te, nor can a man be
&s;atisfied with him&s;elf, while he &s;u&s;pects, that any ex|cellence
or blemi&s;h in a di&s;cour&s;e has pa&s;&s;ed him un|ob&s;erved.
In this ca&s;e, the perfection of the man,
and the perfection of the &s;en&s;e or feeling, are found
to be united. A very delicate palate, on many oc|ca&s;ions,
may be a great inconvenience both to a man
him&s;elf and to his friends; but a delicate ta&s;te of wit
or beauty mu&s;t always be a de&s;irable quality; becau&s;e
it is the &s;ource of all the fine&s;t and mo&s;t innocent en|joyments,
of which human nature is &s;u&s;ceptible. In
<PB N="378" REF="370">
this deci&s;ion the &s;entiments of all mankind are agreed.
Wherever you can fix or a&s;certain a delicacy of ta&s;te,
it is &s;ure to be approved of; and the be&s;t way of
fixing it is to appeal to tho&s;e models and principles,
which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the uniform approba|tion
and experience of nations and ages.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there be naturally a very wide difference
in point of delicacy between one per&s;on and another,
nothing tends further to encrea&s;e and improve this
talent, than <HI>practice</HI> in a particular art, and the fre|quent
&s;urvey or contemplation of a particular &s;pecies
of beauty. When objects of any kind are fir&s;t pre|&s;ented
to the eye or imagination, the &s;entiment, which
attends them, is ob&s;cure and confu&s;ed; and the mind
is, in a great mea&s;ure, incapable of pronouncing con|cerning
their merits or defects. The ta&s;te cannot per|ceive
the &s;everal excellencies of the performance;
much le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h the particular character of each
excellency, and a&s;certain its quality and degree. If
it pronounce the whole in general to be beautiful or
deformed, 'tis the utmo&s;t which can be expected; and
even this judgment a per&s;on, &s;o unpracti&s;ed, will be
apt to deliver with great he&s;itation and re&s;erve. But
allow him to acquire experience in tho&s;e objects, his
feeling becomes more exact and nice: He not only
perceives the beauties and defects of each part, but
marks the di&s;tingui&s;hing &s;pecies of each quality, and
a&s;&s;igns it &s;uitable prai&s;e or blame. A clear and di&s;|tinct
<PB N="379" REF="371">
&s;entiment attends him through the whole &s;ur|vey
of the objects; and he di&s;cerns that very de|gree
and kind of approbation or di&s;plea&s;ure, which
each part is naturally fitted to produce. The mi&s;t
di&s;&s;ipates, which &s;eemed formerly to hang over the
object: The organ acquires greater perfection in its
operations; and can pronounce, without danger of
mi&s;take, concerning the merits of each performance.
In a word, the &s;ame addre&s;s and dexterity, which
practice gives to the execution of any work, is al&s;o
acquired, by the &s;ame means, in the judging of it.</P>
<P>So advantageous is practice to the di&s;cernment of
beauty, that before we can pronounce judgment on
any work of importance, it will even be requi&s;ite,
that that very individual performance be more than
once peru&s;ed by us, and be &s;urveyed in different lights
with attention and deliberation. There is a flutter or
hurry of thought, which attends the fir&s;t peru&s;al of
any piece, and which confounds the genuine &s;entiment
of beauty. The reference of the parts is not di&s;|cerned:
The true characters of &s;tyle are little di&s;tin|gui&s;hed:
The &s;everal perfections and defects &s;eem
wrapped up in a &s;pecies of confu&s;ion, and pre&s;ent
them&s;elves indi&s;tinctly to the imagination. Not to
mention, that there is a &s;pecies of beauty, which, as
it is florid and &s;uperficial, plea&s;es at fir&s;t; but being
found incompatible with a ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ion either of
<PB N="380" REF="372">
rea&s;on or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;oon palls upon the ta&s;te, and is
then rejected with di&s;dain, at lea&s;t rated at a much
lower value.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to continue in the practice of con|templating
any order of beauty, without being fre|quently
obliged to form <HI>compari&s;ons</HI> between the &s;eve|ral
&s;pecies and degrees of excellency, and e&s;timating
their proportion to each other. A man, who has had no
opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beau|ty,
is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opi|nion
with regard to any object pre&s;ented to him.
By compari&s;on alone we fix the epithets of prai&s;e or
blame, and learn how to a&s;&s;ign the due degree of
each. The coar&s;eft dawbing of a &s;ign-po&s;t contains a
certain lu&s;tre of colours and exactne&s;s of imitation,
which are &s;o far beauties, and would affect the mind
of a pea&s;ant or Indian with the highe&s;t admiration.
The mo&s;t vulgar ballads are not entirely de&s;titute of
harmony or nature; and none but a per&s;on, familia|rized
to &s;uperior beauties, would pronounce their num|bers
har&s;h, or narration unintere&s;ting. A great in|feriority
of beauty gives pain to a per&s;on conver&s;ant
in the highe&s;t excellency of the kind, and is for that
rea&s;on pronounced a deformity: As the mo&s;t fini&s;hed
object, with which we are acquainted, is naturally
&s;uppo&s;ed to have reached the pinnacle of perfection,
and to be entitled to the highe&s;t applau&s;e. A man,
who has had opportunities of &s;eeing, and examining
<PB N="381" REF="373">
and weighing the &s;everal performances, admired in
different ages and nations, can alone rate the merits
of a work exhibited to his view, and a&s;&s;ign its proper
rank among the productions of genius.</P>
<P>BUT to enable him the more fully to execute this
undertaking, he mu&s;t pre&s;erve his mind free from all
<HI>prejudice,</HI> and allow nothing to enter into his con&s;ide|ration,
but the very object, which is &s;ubmitted to his
examination. We may ob&s;erve, that every work of
art, in order to produce its due effect on the mind,
mu&s;t be &s;urveyed in a certain point of view, and can|not
be fully reli&s;hed by per&s;ons, who&s;e &s;ituation, real
or imaginary, is not conformable to that required by
the performance. An orator addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to a
particular audience, and mu&s;t have a regard to their
particular genius, intere&s;ts, opinions, pa&s;&s;ions, and
prejudices; otherwi&s;e he hopes in vain to govern their
re&s;olutions, and inflame their affections. Should they
even have entertained &s;ome prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t him,
however unrea&s;onable, he mu&s;t not overlook this di&s;|advantage;
but before he enters upon the &s;ubject,
mu&s;t endeavour to conciliate their affection, and ac|quire
their good graces. A critic of a different age
or nation, who &s;hould peru&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e, mu&s;t
have all the&s;e circum&s;tances in his eye, and mu&s;t place
him&s;elf in the &s;ame &s;ituation as the audience, in order
to form a true judgment of the oration. In like man|ner,
<PB N="382" REF="374">
when any work is addre&s;&s;ed to the public, tho'
I &s;hould have a friend&s;hip or enmity with the author,
I mu&s;t depart from this particular &s;ituation; and con|&s;idering
my&s;elf as a man in general, forget, if po&s;&s;ible,
my individual being and my peculiar circum&s;tances.
A per&s;on, influenced by prejudice, complies not with
this condition; but ob&s;tinately maintains his natural
po&s;ition, without entering into that required by the
performance. If the work be addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons of
a different age or nation, he makes no allowance for
their peculiar views and prejudices; but full of the
manners of his own times, ra&s;hly condemns what
&s;eemed admirable in the eyes of tho&s;e for whom alone
the di&s;cour&s;e was calculated. If the work be executed
for the public, he never &s;ufficiently enlarges his com|prehen&s;ion,
or forgets his intere&s;t as a friend or ene|my,
as a rival or commentator. By this means, his
&s;entiments are perverted; nor have the &s;ame beauties
and blemi&s;hes the &s;ame influence upon him, as if he
had impo&s;ed a proper violence on his imagination, and
had forgot him&s;elf for a moment. So far his ta&s;te
evidently departs from the true &s;tandard; and of con|&s;equence
lo&s;es all credit and authority.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that, in all que&s;tions, &s;ubmitted
to the under&s;tanding, prejudice is mo&s;t de&s;tructive of
&s;ound judgment, and perverts all operations of the in|tellectual
faculties: It is no le&s;s contrary to good ta&s;te;
nor has it le&s;s influence to corrupt our &s;entiments of
<PB N="383" REF="375">
beauty. It belongs to <HI>good &s;en&s;e</HI> to check its influ|ence
in both ca&s;es; and in this re&s;pect, as well as in
many others, rea&s;on, if not an e&s;&s;ential part of ta&s;te,
is at lea&s;t requi&s;ite to the operations of this latter fa|culty.
In all the nobler productions of genius, there
is a mutual relation and corre&s;pondence of parts; nor
can either the beauties or blemi&s;hes be perceived by
him, who&s;e thought is not capacious enough to com|prehend
all tho&s;e parts, and compare them with each
other, in order to perceive the con&s;i&s;tence and uni|formity
of the whole. Every work of art has al&s;o
a certain end or purpo&s;e, for which it is calculated;
and is to be deemed more or le&s;s perfect, as it is more
or le&s;s fitted to attain this end. The object of elo|quence
is to per&s;uade, of hi&s;tory to in&s;truct, of poetry
to plea&s;e by means of the pa&s;&s;ions and the imagina|tion.
The&s;e ends we mu&s;t carry con&s;tantly in our
view, when we peru&s;e any performance; and we mu&s;t
be able to judge how far the means employed are
adapted to their re&s;pective purpo&s;es. Be&s;ides, every
kind of compo&s;ition, even the mo&s;t poetical, is no|thing
but a chain of propo&s;itions and rea&s;onings; not
always indeed the ju&s;te&s;t and mo&s;t exact, but &s;till
plau&s;ible and &s;pecious, however di&s;gui&s;ed by the co|louring
of the imagination. The per&s;ons, intro|duced
in tragedy and epic poetry, mu&s;t be repre|&s;ented
as rea&s;oning and thinking, and concluding
and acting, &s;uitable to their characters and circum|&s;tances;
and without judgment, as well as ta&s;te and
<PB N="384" REF="376">
invention, a poet can never hope to &s;ucceed in &s;o de|licate
an undertaking. Not to mention, that the &s;ame
excellence of faculties which contributes to the im|provement
of rea&s;on, the &s;ame clearne&s;s of concep|tion,
the &s;ame exactne&s;s of di&s;tinction, the &s;ame vi|vacity
of apprehen&s;ion, are e&s;&s;ential to the operations
of true ta&s;te, and are its infallible concomitants. It
&s;eldom, or never happens, that a man of &s;en&s;e, who
has experience in any art, cannot judge of its beauty;
and it is no le&s;s rare to meet with a man, who has a
ju&s;t ta&s;te, without a &s;ound under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>THUS, tho' the principles of ta&s;te be univer&s;al, and
nearly, if not entirely the &s;ame in all men; yet few
are qualified to give judgment on any work of art, or
e&s;tabli&s;h their own &s;entiment as the &s;tandard of beauty.
The organs of internal &s;en&s;ation are &s;eldom &s;o perfect
as to allow the general principles their full play, and
produce a feeling corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e principles.
They either labour under &s;ome defect, or are vitiated
by &s;ome di&s;order; and by that means, excite a &s;en|timent,
which may be pronounced erroneous. When
the critic has no delicacy, he judges without any di&s;|tinction,
and is only affected by the gro&s;&s;er and more
palpable qualities of the object: The finer touches
pa&s;s unnoticed and di&s;regarded. Where he is not
aided by practice, his verdict is attended with con|fu&s;ion
and he&s;itation. Where no compari&s;on has been
employed, the mo&s;t frivolous beauties, &s;uch as rather
<PB N="385" REF="377">
merit the name of defects, are the objects of his admi|ration.
Where he lies under the influence of preju|dice,
all his natural &s;entiments are perverted. Where
good &s;en&s;e is wanting, he is not qualified to di&s;cern
the beauties of de&s;ign and rea&s;oning, which are the
highe&s;t and mo&s;t excellent. Under &s;ome or other of
the&s;e imperfections, the generality of men labour;
and hence a true judge in the finer arts is ob&s;erved,
even during the mo&s;t poli&s;hed ages, to be &s;o rare a
character: Strong &s;en&s;e united to delicate &s;entiment,
improved by practice, perfected by compari&s;on, and
cleared of all prejudice, can alone entitle critics to
this valuable character; and the joint verdict of &s;uch,
wherever they are to be found, is the true &s;tandard of
ta&s;te and beauty.</P>
<P>BUT where are &s;uch critics to be found? By what
marks are they to be known? How di&s;tingui&s;h them
from pretenders? The&s;e que&s;tions are embarra&s;&s;ing;
and &s;eem to throw us back into the &s;ame uncertainty,
from which, during the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay, we have
endeavoured to extricate our&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT if we con&s;ider the matter aright, the&s;e are
que&s;tions of fact, not of &s;entiment. Whether any
particular per&s;on be endowed with good &s;en&s;e and a
delicate imagination, free from prejudice, may often
be the &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and be liable to great di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
<PB N="386" REF="378">
and enquiry: But that &s;uch a character is va|luable
and e&s;timable will be agreed by all mankind.
Where the&s;e doubts occur, men can do no more than
in other di&s;putable que&s;tions, which are &s;ubmitted to
the under&s;tanding: They mu&s;t produce the be&s;t ar|guments,
which their invention &s;ugge&s;ts to them;
they mu&s;t acknowledge a true and deci&s;ive &s;tandard
to exi&s;t &s;omewhere, to wit, real exi&s;tence and matter
of fact; and they mu&s;t have indulgence to &s;uch as
differ from them in their appeals to this &s;tandard.
It is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e, if we have
proved, that the ta&s;te of all individuals is not upon
an equal footing, and that &s;ome men in general,
however difficult to be particularly pitched upon, will
be acknowledged by univer&s;al &s;entiment to have a
preference above others.</P>
<P>BUT in reality the difficulty of finding, even in
particulars, the &s;tandard of ta&s;te, is not &s;o great as it
is repre&s;ented. Tho' in &s;peculation, we may readily
avow a certain criterion in &s;cience and deny it in &s;en|timent,
the matter is found in practice to be much
more hard to a&s;certain in the former ca&s;e than in the
latter. Theories of ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy, &s;y&s;tems of
profound theology have prevailed during one age: In
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ive period, the&s;e have been univer&s;ally ex|ploded:
Their ab&s;urdity has been detected: Other
theories and &s;y&s;tems have &s;upplied their place, which
<PB N="387" REF="379">
again gave way to their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: And nothing has
been experienced more liable to the revolutions of
chance and fa&s;hion than the&s;e pretended deci&s;ions of
&s;cience. The ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with the beauties
of eloquence and poetry. Ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of pa&s;&s;ion
and nature are &s;ure, after a little time, to gain public
vogue, which they maintain for ever. ARISTOTLE
and PLATO, and EPICURUS and DESCARTES, may
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively yield to each other: But TERENCE and
VIRGIL maintain an univer&s;al, undi&s;puted empire
over the minds of men. The ab&s;tract philo&s;ophy of
CICERO has lo&s;t its credit: The vehemence of his
oratory is &s;till the object of our admiration.</P>
<P>THO' men of delicate ta&s;te are rare, they are ea&s;ily
to be di&s;tingui&s;hed in &s;ociety by the &s;oundne&s;s of their
under&s;tanding and the &s;uperiority of their faculties
above the re&s;t of mankind. The a&s;cendant, which
they acquire, gives a prevalence to that lively appro|bation,
with which they receive any productions of
genius, and renders it generally predominant. Many
men, when left to them&s;elves, have but a faint and
dubious perception of beauty, who yet are capable
of reli&s;hing any fine &s;troke, which is pointed out to
them. Every convert to the admiration of the real
poet or orator is the cau&s;e of &s;ome new conver&s;ion.
And tho' prejudices may prevail for a time, they ne|ver
unite in celebrating any rival to the true genius,
<PB N="388" REF="380">
but yield at la&s;t to the force of nature and ju&s;t &s;enti|ment.
And thus tho' a civilized nation may ea&s;ily
be mi&s;taken in the choice of their admired philo&s;o|pher,
they never have been found long to err, in
their affection for a favourite epic or tragic author.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all our endeavours to fix a
&s;tandard of ta&s;te, and reconcile the various apprehen|&s;ions
of men, there &s;till remain two &s;ources of vari|ation,
which are not &s;ufficient indeed to confound all
the boundaries of beauty and deformity, but will
often &s;erve to vary the degrees of our approbation or
blame. The one is the different humours of parti|cular
men; the other, the particular manners and
opinions of our age and country. The general prin|ciples
of ta&s;te are uniform in human nature: Where
men vary in their judgments, &s;ome defect of per|ver&s;ion
in the faculties may commonly be remarked;
proceeding either from prejudice, from want of prac|tice,
or want of delicacy; and there is ju&s;t rea&s;on
for approving one ta&s;te, and condemning another.
But where there is &s;uch a diver&s;ity in the internal
frame or external &s;ituation as is entirely blamele&s;s on
both &s;ides, and leaves no room to give one the pre|ference
above the other; in that ca&s;e a certain diver|&s;ity
of judgment is unavoidable, and we &s;eek in vain
for a &s;tandard, by which we can reconcile the contrary
&s;entiments.</P>
<P><PB N="389" REF="381">
A YOUNG man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are warm, will be
more &s;en&s;ibly touched with amorous and tender
images, than a man more advanced in years, who
takes plea&s;ure in wi&s;e and philo&s;ophical reflections
concerning the conduct of life and moderation of the
pa&s;&s;ions. At twenty, OVID may be the favourite
author; HORACE at forty; and perhaps TACITUS at
fifty. Vainly would we, in &s;uch ca&s;es, endeavour to
enter into the &s;entiments of others, and dive&s;t our|&s;elves
of tho&s;e propen&s;ities, which are natural to us.
We chu&s;e our favourite author as we do our friend,
from a conformity of humours and di&s;po&s;itions. Mirth
or pa&s;&s;ion, &s;entiment or reflection; which ever of
the&s;e mo&s;t predominates in our temper, it gives us a
peculiar &s;ympathy with the writer who re&s;embles us.</P>
<P>ONE per&s;on is more plea&s;ed with the &s;ublime; ano|ther
with the tender; a third with raillery. One has
a &s;trong &s;en&s;ibility to blemi&s;hes, and is extremely &s;tudi|ous
of correctne&s;s: Another has a more lively feeling
of beauties, and pardons twenty ab&s;urdities and de|fects
for one elevated or pathetic &s;troke. The ear of
this man is entirely turned towards conci&s;ene&s;s and
energy; that man is delighted with a copious, rich,
and harmonious expre&s;&s;ion. Simplicity is affected by
one; ornament by another. Comedy, tragedy, &s;a|tire,
odes have each their partizans, who prefer that
particular &s;pecies of writing to all others. It is
plainly an error in a critic, to confine his approbation
<PB N="390" REF="382">
to one &s;pecies or &s;tyle of writing, and condemn all
the re&s;t. But it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible not to feel a pre|dilection
for that which &s;uits our particular turn and
di&s;po&s;ition. Such preferences are innocent and un|avoidable,
and can never rea&s;onably be the object of
di&s;pute, becau&s;e there is no &s;tandard, by which they
can be decided.</P>
<P>FOR a like rea&s;on, we are more plea&s;ed with pic|tures
of characters, which re&s;emble &s;uch as are found
in our own age or country, than with tho&s;e which de|&s;cribe
a different &s;et of cu&s;toms. 'Tis not without &s;ome
effort, that we reconcile our&s;elves to the &s;implicity
of antient manners, and behold prince&s;&s;es drawing
water from a &s;pring, and kings and heroes dre&s;&s;ing
their own victuals. We may allow in general, that
the repre&s;entation of &s;uch manners is no fault in the
author, nor deformity in the piece; but we are not
&s;o &s;en&s;ibly touched with them. For this rea&s;on, co|medy
is not transferred ea&s;ily from one age or nation
to another. A FRENCHMAN or ENGLISHMAN is not
plea&s;ed with the ANDRIA of TERENCE, or CLITIA
of MACHIAVEL, where the fine lady, upon whom all
the play turns, never once appears to the &s;pectators,
but is always kept behind the &s;cenes, &s;uitable to the
re&s;erved humour of the antient GREEKS and modern
ITALIANS. A man of learning and reflection can
make allowance for the&s;e peculiarities of manners;
but a common audience can never dive&s;t them&s;elves &s;o
<PB N="391" REF="383">
far of their u&s;ual ideas and &s;entiments as to reli&s;h pic|tures
which no way re&s;emble them.</P>
<P>AND here there occurs a reflection, which may,
perhaps, be u&s;eful in examining the celebrated con|trover&s;y
concerning antient and modern learning;
where we often find the one &s;ide excu&s;ing any &s;eeming
ab&s;urdity in the antients from the manners of the
age, and the other refu&s;ing to admit this excu&s;e, or
at lea&s;t, admitting it only as an apology for the au|thor,
not for the performance. In my opinion, the
proper bounds in this &s;ubject have &s;eldom been fixed
between the contending parties. Where any inno|cent
peculiarities of manners are repre&s;ented, &s;uch as
tho&s;e abovementioned, they ought certainly to be ad|mitted;
and a man who is &s;hocked with them, gives
an evident proof of fal&s;e delicacy and refinement.
The poets <HI>monument more durable than bra&s;s,</HI> mu&s;t fall
to the ground like common brick or clay, were men
to make no allowance for the continual revolutions of
manners and cu&s;toms, and would admit nothing but
what was &s;uitable to the prevailing fa&s;hion. Mu&s;t
we throw a&s;ide the pictures of our ance&s;tors, becau&s;e
of their ruffs and fardingales? But where the ideas
of morality and decency alter from one age to ano|ther,
and where vicious manners are de&s;cribed, with|out
being marked with the proper characters of blame
and di&s;approbation; this mu&s;t be allowed to disfigure
the poem, and to be a real deformity. I cannot,
nor is it proper I &s;hould, enter into &s;uch &s;entiments;
<PB N="392" REF="384">
and however I may excu&s;e the poet, on account of
the manners of his age, I never can reli&s;h the
compo&s;ition. The want of humanity and of de|cency,
&s;o con&s;picuous in the characters drawn by
&s;everal of the antient poets, even &s;ometimes by
HOMER and the GREEK tragedians, dimini&s;hes con|&s;iderably
the merit of their noble peformances,
and gives modern authors a great advantage over
them. We are not intere&s;ted in the fortunes and
&s;entiments of &s;uch rough heroes: We are di&s;|plea&s;ed
to find the limits of vice and virtue &s;o con|founded:
And whatever indulgence we may give the
writer on account of his prejudices, we cannot pre|vail
on our&s;elves to enter into his &s;entiments, or bear
an affection to characters, which we plainly di&s;cover
to be blameable.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with moral principles, as
with &s;peculative opinions of any kind. The&s;e are in
continual flux and revolution. The &s;on embraces a
different &s;y&s;tem from the father. Nay, there &s;carce
is any man, who can boa&s;t of great con&s;tancy and
uniformity in this particular. Whatever &s;peculative
errors may be found in the polite writings of any age
or country, they detract but little from the value of
tho&s;e compo&s;itions. There needs but a certain turn
of thought or imagination to make us enter into all
the opinions, which then prevailed, and reli&s;h the
<PB N="393" REF="385">
&s;entiments or conclu&s;ions derived from them. But a
very violent effort is requi&s;ite to change our judgment
of manners, and excite &s;entiments of approbation or
blame, love or hatred, different from tho&s;e to which
the mind $word$ long cu&s;tom has been familiarized.
And where a man is confident of the rectitude of that
moral &s;tandard, by which he judges, he is ju&s;tly jea|lous
of it, and will not pervert the &s;entiments of his
heart for a moment, in complai&s;ance to any writer
whatever.</P>
<P>OF all &s;peculative errors, tho&s;e which regard reli|gion,
are the mo&s;t excu&s;able in compo&s;itions of ge|nius;
nor is it ever permitted to judge of the civility
or wi&s;dom of any people, or even of &s;ingle per&s;ons,
by the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s or refinement of their theological
principles. The &s;ame good &s;en&s;e, that directs men
in the ordinary occurrences of life, is not hearkened
to in religious matters, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be placed
entirely above the cognizance of human rea&s;on. Up|on
this account, all the ab&s;urdities of the pagan &s;y&s;|tem
of theology mu&s;t be overlooked by every critic,
who would pretend to form a ju&s;t notion of antient
poetry; and our po&s;terity, in their turn, mu&s;t have
the &s;ame indulgence to their forefathers. No religi|ous
principles can ever be imputed as a fault to any
poet, while they remain merely principles, and take
not &s;uch &s;trong po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his heart, as to lay him
under the imputation of <HI>bigotry</HI> or <HI>&s;uper&s;tition.</HI> Where
<PB N="394" REF="386">
that happens, they confound the &s;entiments of mo|rality,
and alter the natural boundaries of vice and
virtue. They are therefore eternal blemi&s;hes, accord|ing
to the principle abovementioned: $$or are the
prejudices and fal&s;e opinions of the age &s;ufficient to
ju&s;tify them.</P>
<P>'TIS e&s;&s;ential to the ROMAN catholic religion to in|&s;pire
a violent hatred to every other wor&s;hip, and re|pre&s;ent
all pagans, mahometans, and heretics as the
objects of divine wrath and vengeance. Such &s;enti|ments,
tho' they are in reality extremely blameable,
are con&s;idered as virtues by the zealots of that com|munion,
and are repre&s;ented in their tragedies and
epic poems as a kind of divine heroi&s;m. This bi|gotry
has disfigured two very fine tragedies of the
FRENCH theatre, POLIEUCTE and ATHALIA; where
an intemperate zeal for particular modes of wor&s;hip
is &s;et off with all the pomp imaginable, and forms
the predominant character of the heroes. &startq;What
is this,&endq; &s;ays the heroic JOAD to JOSABET, finding
her in di&s;cour&s;e with MATHAN, the prie&s;t of BAA$,
&startq;Does the daughter of DAVID &s;peak to this traitor?
Are you not afraid, le&s;t the earth &s;hould open and
pour forth flames to devour you both? Or le&s;t
the&s;e holy walls &s;hould fall and cru&s;h you together?
What is his purpo&s;e? Why comes that enemy of
God hither to poi&s;on the air, which we breathe, with
<PB N="395" REF="387">
his horrid pre&s;ence?&endq; Such &s;entiments are received
with great applau&s;e on the theatre of PARIS; but at
LONDON the &s;pectators would be full as much plea&s;ed
to hear ACHILLES tell AGAMEMNON, that he was a
dog in his forehead, and a deer in his heart, or JUPI|TER
threaten JUNO with a &s;ound drubbing, if &s;he will
not be quiet.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS principles are al&s;o a blemi&s;h in any
polite compo&s;ition, when they ri&s;e up to &s;uper&s;tition,
and intrude them&s;elves into every &s;entiment, however
remote from any connection with religion. 'Tis no
excu&s;e for the poet, that the cu&s;toms of his country
had burthened life with &s;o many religious ceremonies
and ob&s;ervances, that no part of it was exempt from
that yoak. It mu&s;t be for ever ridiculous in PE|TRARCH
to compare his mi&s;tre&s;s, LAURA, to JESUS
CHRIST. Nor is it le&s;s ridiculous in that agreeable
libertine, BOCCACE, very &s;eriou&s;ly to give thanks to
God Almighty, and the ladies, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance in
defending him again&s;t his enemies.</P>
