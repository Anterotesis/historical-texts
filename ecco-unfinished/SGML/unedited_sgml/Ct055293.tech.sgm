<HEAD>To Dr. * * *</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE our la&s;t conver&s;ation, I have been endea|vouring
to collect and dige&s;t my thoughts, touching
the external u&s;e of Mineral Waters, as comprehended in
the three &s;everal articles of <HI>Pumping, Bathing,</HI> and <HI>Fo|mentation;</HI>
but in the cour&s;e of my reflections, I fine the
&s;ubject cannot be properly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed within the limits of a
&s;mall occa&s;ional Pamphlet; and, with regard to a com|pleat
&s;y&s;t$$, I have neither time nor opportunity to con|firm
by experiments, the particular notions I entertain
concerning the efficacy of tho&s;e Waters: Neverthele&s;s, I
&s;hall, in compliance with your reque&s;t, commit to the Pub|lic,
the&s;e opinions, &s;ingular as they are, with the rea&s;ons
on which they are built, in hope that they will prove &s;er|viceable
hints to tho&s;e who are better qualified than my|&s;elf,
for pro&s;ecuting u&s;eful inquiries in the medical world.
True it is the <HI>Thermae</HI> and <HI>Acidulae,</HI> or hot and cold Mi|neral
Springs, have been inve&s;tigated by &s;o many different
pens, and produced &s;uch a variety of opinions among
phy&s;icians and chemi&s;ts, that there is very little encou|ragement
for any man to commence author on the &s;ame
<PB N="2" REF="4">
branch of natural knowledge, becau&s;e he mu&s;t run a very
great ri&s;que of &s;eeing his &s;entiments neglected among the
number of tho&s;e vague <HI>Hypothe&s;es</HI> which are looked upon
as the children of idle imagination.</P>
<P>One writer denies that the Water in the generality of
Hot Wells, is impregnated with <HI>Sulphur;</HI> while another
affirms, that, without <HI>Sulphur,</HI> no &s;uch natural Hot Wa|ters
can exi&s;t. Yet, both the&s;e authors quote experiments
to vouch for the truth of their different a&s;&s;everations;
one a&s;&s;erting, that although he had immer&s;ed &s;ilver in ma|ny
of the mo&s;t noted <HI>Thermae</HI> on the continent of <HI>Europe,</HI>
he could not perceive the colour of the metal changed;
neither could he procure any real brim&s;tone by evaporat|ing
the Water; nor would the re&s;idue, when mixed with
Salt of <HI>Tartar,</HI> produce the <HI>Hepar Sulphuris.</HI> But, in
oppo&s;ition to this Doctrine, there are &s;o many concurring
ob&s;ervations, that it is amazing to &s;ee it maintained by an
author of <HI>Hoffman</HI>'s reputation; for, be&s;ides the Hot
Baths of <HI>Au&s;tria</HI> and <HI>Hungary,</HI> de&s;cribed in the Philo&s;o|phical
Tran&s;actions, and the Spaw at <HI>Harrigate,</HI> in which
Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> found actual brim&s;tone floating in flakes; <HI>Hoff|man</HI>
him&s;elf owns that the Waters at <HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI>
which are better known than any other in <HI>Europe,</HI> abound
with this Mineral in &s;uch quantities, that whole pounds of
the flowers of <HI>Sulphur</HI> are found &s;ticking to the &s;tones
that line the fountain-head of the Springs.</P>
<P>Nor are the opinions of chemi&s;ts le&s;s contradictory in
their <HI>Analy&s;ations</HI> of cold <HI>chalybeate</HI> Waters. Some of that
<PB N="3" REF="5">
cla&s;s &s;ay, they contain an <HI>Acid,</HI> whence their Name <HI>Aci|dulae;</HI>
while others (and among the re&s;t, <HI>Hoffman,</HI>)
deny the <HI>Acid:</HI> Nay, he pretends to have found a manife&s;t
<HI>alkaline Salt,</HI> and upon this Proof, erects a theory of their
operation on the human vi&s;cera, when drank in large quan|tities:
but this <HI>Alkali</HI> is, by Dr. <HI>Short</HI> explained into a &s;e|diment
of <HI>calcareous Earth,</HI> and a portion of common &s;alt.
<HI>Hoffman</HI> likewi&s;e denies the exi&s;tence of fixed or real <HI>Vi|triol</HI>
in the&s;e Waters, though he allows they are impreg|nated
with a <HI>vitriolic Acid;</HI> but <HI>Short</HI> ju&s;tly blames him
for making &s;uch a di&s;tinction without a real difference;
and Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI> hints a method for obtaining from them a
&s;olid <HI>Vitriol.</HI></P>
<P>Such diver&s;ity of opinions, among tho&s;e who have laid
them&s;elves out for <HI>analy&s;ing</HI> Mineral Waters, cannot fail to
perplex and embarra&s;s people who attempt to rea&s;on upon
the u&s;e of them, without having had the advantage of &s;ee|ing
their effects, in a long cour&s;e of practice, by which
alone their Medicinal Virtues are to be a&s;certained.</P>
<P>For my own part, without having recour&s;e to the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a <HI>Spiritus Rector,</HI> an <HI>Acidum vagum,</HI> or
&s;ubtile <HI>ela&s;tic Spirit,</HI> univer&s;al cau&s;e and fountain of all
particular <HI>Spirits,</HI> whether in the mineral, vegetable or
animal world&mdash;I &s;ay, without the interpo&s;ition of any
&s;uch unintelligible influence, I can ea&s;ily conceive how
extraordinary cures may be performed by the mechanical
effects of &s;imple <HI>Water</HI> upon the human Body; and I
<PB N="4" REF="6">
f$lly believe that in the u&s;e of <HI>bathing</HI> and <HI>pumping, that</HI>
Efficacy is often a&s;cribed to the <HI>mineral Particles,</HI>
which properly belongs to the <HI>Element</HI> it&s;elf, exclu&s;ive of
any foreign a&s;&s;i&s;tance.&mdash;<HI>Hoffman</HI> indeed, acknowledges
that the energy of mineral waters, both in preventing
and curing Di&s;ea&s;es, is in a great mea&s;ure, owing to the
Water it&s;elf; though he alledges the other principles &s;erve
to &s;timulate and quicken its operation.</P>
<P><HI>Pure Water</HI> is certainly of all others, the mo&s;t &s;alutary
beverage, as being the be&s;t fitted to mix with all the
animal juices, a&s;&s;i&s;t the different &s;ecretions of the human
body, and prevent that Rigidity and <HI>Coale&s;cence</HI> of the
ve&s;&s;els, which are the immediate cau&s;es of old age; and
while it thus acts as an univer&s;al <HI>Deob&s;truent,</HI> by di|luting
the Fluids; in&s;tead of <HI>abrading,</HI> or offending the
&s;olids, it clears them from all <HI>extrane$us</HI> adhe&s;ions, and
manife&s;tly contributes to the pre&s;ervation of their due
tone and flexibility. The&s;e admirable qualities inherent
in &s;imple Water, are clearly evinced by the uninterrupt|ed
health, good &s;pirits, and <HI>Longaevity</HI> of tho&s;e who u&s;e
nothing el&s;e for their ordinary drink; and many in|&s;tances
might be given of acute and ardent Fevers cured
by plentiful draughts of warm water; as well as of <HI>chro|nical</HI>
Di&s;tempers that have yielded to a regular cour&s;e of
drinking cold, Spring-water at the Fountain-head. But,
&s;uch an enquiry does not fall within my de&s;ign, which
was that of con&s;idering the Fluid in its external appli|cation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7">
I have known the mo&s;t &s;ordid and inveterate <HI>&s;crophu|lous</HI>
and <HI>&s;corbutic</HI> ulcers cured by the <HI>a&s;per&s;ion</HI> of common
Well-water, which to the ta&s;te and &s;mell, exhibited no
&s;igns of mineral impregnation; but, at fir&s;t, derived its
reputation from the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, by whom,
in times of ignorance, it had been dedicated to one of the
legendary &s;aints of the Roman kalendar. Such cures are
undoubtedly performed by the coldne&s;s, pre&s;&s;ure, and
moi&s;ture of tho&s;e waters: the fir&s;t communicates a &s;pring
to the decayed or di&s;ea&s;ed &s;olids, by which the ve&s;&s;els are
enabled to propel their contents, and renew the circula|tion,
which had been impeded; the pre&s;&s;ure &s;upports the
weakened &s;ides of the capillaries or fine lymphatics again&s;t
the increa&s;ed momentum of the juices thus again &s;et in
motion, helping, at the &s;ame time, to re&s;train the <HI>fun|gous</HI>
excre&s;cences, in determining that praeternatural <HI>In|crementum</HI>
in a lateral direction&punc; by which a re-union of
the fibres is effected; and the moi&s;ture deterges the ulcer,
by wa&s;hing away the <HI>acrid</HI> matter, which would other|wi&s;e
<HI>corrode</HI> the parts, and con&s;equently ob&s;truct the cure.</P>
<P>Surgeons in general, are, in my opinion, too neglect|ful
in making due compre&s;&s;ion, in &s;ores over-run with
<HI>Fungus,</HI> or circum&s;cribed with <HI>Callus.</HI> In the&s;e ca&s;es, the
tone of the &s;olids is always debilitated or lo&s;t; and when
the excre&s;cences regerminated (as it were) under the knife,
and &s;prung up, in &s;pite of all the <HI>Catheretics</HI> and even
<HI>Cau&s;tics</HI> that could be u&s;ed, I have known them &s;ubdued
by moderate compre&s;&s;ion, and a kindly dige&s;tion obtain|ed.
<PB N="6" REF="8">
In all wounds al&s;o, that happen in parts of a loo&s;e
or membranous texture, and are become <HI>fi&s;tulous,</HI> from
the nature of their &s;ituation, &s;uch as tho&s;e in the <HI>Urethra,</HI>
or in the cheek, when the &s;alival duct is divided, it will
be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to effect the cure, without a particu|lar
attention to this circum&s;tance of pre&s;&s;ure, which, if
properly conducted, will &s;eldom or never fail.</P>
<P>The efficacy of the <HI>Cold Bath,</HI> tho' unimpregnated with
mineral principles, is &s;o well known in <HI>hypochondriac</HI> Di&s;|orders,
in di&s;ea&s;es of the lax fibre, and partial weakne&s;&s;es,
when the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> are not un&s;ound, that there is &s;carce a
Phy&s;ician, Surgeon, or Apothecary, who has not oppor|tunities
of &s;eeing it every day. Tho&s;e, therefore, who
want further information on this head, I refer to the writ|ings
of <HI>Floyer</HI> and <HI>Baynard;</HI> together with a very inge|nious
e&s;&s;ay written in Italian by <HI>Antonio Cocchi,</HI> and print|ed
at <HI>Rome</HI> in the year 1738, in a collection intituled&punc;
<HI>Saggi di di&s;&s;ertazioni accademiche, pubblicamente lette
nella nob$le accademia Etru&s;ca dell' antichi&s;&s;ima Citt&agrave; di
Cortona.</HI> Tomo II.</P>
<P>The author of this di&s;&s;ertation, which is the tenth as it
&s;tands in the volume, ju&s;tifies the external u&s;e of cold
Water, from the practice of the Antients; and, in the
cour&s;e of his di&s;qui&s;itions, forms a very plau&s;ible conjec|ture,
touching the di&s;temper of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> which was
cured by the celebrated <HI>Antonius Mu&s;a.</HI> He refutes the
opinion of tho&s;e who &s;uppo&s;ed the Emperor's di&s;ea&s;e was
<PB N="7" REF="9">
a gout, by mi&s;taking the word <HI>Arteria</HI> for <HI>Articulare;</HI>
and brings very good rea&s;ons for believing that it was a
<HI>Tabes pituitaria,</HI> &s;eated in the glands of the Palate, Fau|ces,
and <HI>A&s;peria Arteria:</HI> Accordingly, <HI>Mu&s;a</HI> pre&s;cribed
cool gargles, and ordered cold Water to be thrown up|on
his body. But I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the
effects of &s;imple Water, in the article of Pumping; a me|thod
of application, in which it will undoubtedly act with
great and &s;urpri&s;ing energy, upon the nerves and fibres of
the human body.</P>
<P>The learned and judicious Commentator upon <HI>Boer|haave</HI>'s
Aphori&s;ms, &s;ays, he has &s;ometimes cured chro|nical
Tumours about the knee, that re&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t every
other remedy, by letting warm Water fall from an high
place, <HI>guttatim,</HI> or drop by drop, upon the part: if
therefore warm water de&s;cending with &s;uch an incon|&s;iderable
<HI>Momentum,</HI> and in &s;o &s;mall a Volume, will
prove efficacious in removing one of the mo&s;t unyield|ing
of all Tumours; what may not be expected from
the de&s;cent of a full Stream that covers at once, the part
affected? It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, indeed, that a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
of &s;ingle Drops falling upon different parts of the Tu|mour,
may produce a gentle undulation in the di&s;ea&s;ed
ve&s;&s;els, by which the ob&s;tructed Matter is <HI>comminuted,</HI>
put in motion and expelled; whereas, a large &s;heet of
Water, that covers the whole &s;urface of the di&s;ea&s;ed part,
pre&s;&s;es equally on every point of it; &s;o that the ob&s;truct|ed
matter cannot move to any one place of the Tu|mour,
<PB N="8" REF="10">
where there is le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance than in any other;
but, if the Pump be of a moderate diameter, and the
Stream properly managed and played upon the part, the
re&s;i&s;tance may be varied to much better effect, than we
can hope from &s;uch a trifling di&s;tillation of one &s;ingle
Drop &s;ucceeding another; and warm Water pumped
upon any di&s;ea&s;ed part, not only acts by pre&s;&s;ure, but
has other effects in common with cold Water applied in
the &s;ame manner, a practice which I will venture to re|commend
as a very powerful and &s;alutary method of ap|plication.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hipp$$rates,</HI> in his Chapter <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, expre&s;ly &s;ays, That &s;wellings in the joints, together with gouty pains in the feet, are ex|te$uated and ea&s;ed by a plentiful affu&s;ion of cold Water. And the &s;ame method of practice was adopted by <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> who, in treating of arthritical pains, ob&s;erves, That if they are attended with tumour and heat, refrigerants are proper; and therefore orders the parts affected to be plunged and even de|tained in the colde&s;t Water, tho' not for any length of time; nor would he have this practi&s;ed every day, le&s;t the tendons &s;hould be contracted, and grow &s;tiff. We are al&s;o informed by <HI>Aetius,</HI> that <HI>Archigenes</HI> recommended the &s;ame remedy, on the &s;ame occa&s;ions.</NOTE></P>
<P>If a white &s;welling of the Joint, or contraction of the
<HI>Flexor Tendons</HI> of the knee, be &s;ubjected to a temporary
ca&s;cade of cold Water, the part affected, in&s;tead of &s;u&s;|taining
a continued and equal pre&s;&s;ure, as would be the
ca&s;e, were it immer&s;ed in the Bath, undergoes a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of impul&s;es from the falling &s;tream, infinitely more
delicate and effectual than any kind of dry <HI>Friction;</HI> for
while the ob&s;tructed and &s;tagnating Fluids are (as it were)
driven from the places of their confinement, by the re|peated
<PB N="9" REF="11">
&s;trokes of the Water, the momentary interval be|twixt
every &s;hock, gives more play to the ela&s;tic &s;ides
of the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, and creates an <HI>o&s;cillatory</HI> Motion,
which helps to divide the preternatural <HI>Moleculae</HI> of the
impacted juices, thereby rendring them more fit for the
purpo&s;es of minute circulation; at the &s;ame time, the
&s;udden da&s;h of a cold fluid, acts as a <HI>Stimulus,</HI> upon
the relaxed or ob&s;tructed Tubes which a&s;&s;i&s;t in the
general <HI>Ni&s;us,</HI> by a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of extraordinary contrac|tions.</P>
<P>What pa&s;&s;es within the ob&s;tructed ve&s;&s;el, when the
&s;tagnating fluid is propelled, hath been curiou&s;ly de&s;crib|ed
by <HI>Leeuwenhoeck,</HI> who, in the membranous expan&s;ion
that &s;erves in&s;tead of a wing to a bat, ob&s;erved, by the
help of his gla&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t tendency to <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> in the
blood which had been totally congealed by cold: at fir&s;t,
he could perceive no motion either in the arteries or veins,
until the animal reviving by degrees, he beheld an oblong
ma&s;s of concreted blood, which filled the whole cavity of
the artery, begin to move backwards and forwards in the
ve&s;&s;el, which, by its &s;ucce&s;&s;ive contractions, gradually di&s;|&s;olved
the <HI>Coagulum,</HI> &s;o as to render the whole fit for cir|culation.
Here, indeed, the ob&s;truction was thawed by
the revival of natural heat, and the motion fir&s;t began in
the fluid; but, in Pumping, the <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> is immediately
owing to the contraction of the ve&s;&s;el, occa&s;ioned by the
effects of the Water upon the nervous &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;Perhaps,
too, the imagination is concerned, being acted upon by a
<PB N="10" REF="12">
certain timidity of expectation between every &s;troke of the
falling fluid.&mdash;That fancy operates with great power up|on
the human body, is &s;o evident in all <HI>hypochondriac</HI> and
<HI>hy&s;teric</HI> di&s;orders, that it would be idle and &s;uperfluous to
call in the evidence of facts in &s;upport of a truth &s;o well
known.</P>
<P>Exce&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion hath often proved fatal both to men
and women, and the common &s;ymptoms of fear indicate a
total contraction of the animal machine: the blood is
driven from the cheeks, and &s;urface of the body, to|wards
the head, heart, and other internal parts, whence
palpitations, throbbings in the arteries of the brain, and
a general con&s;triction of the whole fibrile &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;<HI>Van
Swieten</HI> relates the ca&s;e of a woman in good health, who,
from a &s;udden fright, was &s;eized with a tumour in one of
her brea&s;ts, which, in &s;pite of the mo&s;t &s;kilful treatment,
hardened into a confirmed <HI>Schirrus:</HI> it is a con&s;tant ob|&s;ervation,
that, when &s;oldiers march to battle, there is a|mong
them a remarkable evacuation by &s;tool; and I know
an in&s;tance of a woman, who, being apprehended on a
criminal accu&s;ation, was &s;o terrified when the officers of
ju&s;tice appeared, that her urine and <HI>Faeces</HI> were expelled
with incredible force.</P>
<P>The cure of <HI>W$$s</HI> by the application of the hand of a
per&s;on who hath been hanged, can be accounted for no
other way but from the coldne&s;s of the cadaver, the friction
<PB N="11" REF="13">
of the member, and the power of imagination. Neither
is this to be reckoned among tho&s;e idle remedies that owe
their credit to the &s;uper&s;titious fables of old women: I
knew a young gentleman of good &s;en&s;e, who had a large
<HI>&s;trumous</HI> &s;welling upon one &s;ide of his neck, and &s;ubmit|ted
it to this application, which, (he owned) had a re|markable
effect upon his &s;pirits, from that natural antipa|thy
which almo&s;t every body has to the touch of a corp&s;e:
for &s;ome days, his imagination dwelt upon the experi|ment
with a kind of horror that &s;eemed to thrill, in re|peated
vibrations, from the part, which began to put on
a more inflammatory appearance, and, I make no doubt,
would have been altogether di&s;&s;olved by frequent repetition
of the &s;ame medicine, which, (however) he refu&s;ed to un|dergo.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was, doubtle&s;s, from &s;uch effects of fancy, that our
$$ings, of old, derived their power of healing <HI>&s;crophulous</HI>
di&s;tempers by the touch; a poor di&s;ea&s;ed wretch, of low
&s;tation, and weak intellects, prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the &s;uper|&s;titious
notion of a delegated power from Heaven, and
&s;truck with the <HI>Apparatus,</HI> as well as with the &s;ublime
rank of the <HI>Operator,</HI> acting in the double capacity of a|po&s;tle
and king, could not fail to be extremely affected
through the whole &s;y&s;tem of the nerves, and &s;uffer &s;uch
agitations in the blood and &s;pirits, as might work great
changes in the con&s;titution: yet the&s;e effects would vary
according to the different di&s;po&s;itions of different patients,
<PB N="12" REF="14">
and their various &s;ituations in life.&mdash;But to return from
this digre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Pumping</HI> is attended with another con&s;e|quence,
which, in all probability, adds to its &s;alutary ef|fect:
the Water, in its fall, is broke into very minute par|ticles,
by the re&s;i&s;tance of the air, as well as by its da&s;hing
again&s;t the di&s;ea&s;ed limb, and the ci&s;tern or pavement
that receives it; &s;o that the atmo&s;phere is loaded with a
kind of mi&s;t, which being kept in motion by the <HI>Pump|ing,</HI>
may act by way of <HI>Fomentation</HI> upon the part affect|ed.
True it is, the coldne&s;s of the fluid &s;eems to contra|dict
this &s;uppo&s;ition, becau&s;e it is the known property of
cold to contract the pores of the &s;kin, con&s;equently, to
refu&s;e admi&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e floating corpu&s;cles: but Water,
&s;u&s;pended in &s;eparate globules, has not that aggregate cold|ne&s;s
which we find in a collected ma&s;s; therefore we are
not to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>va&s;a inhiantia</HI> on the &s;urface of the bo|dy
altogether &s;hut: and it is well known that the parti|cles
of cold Water are more penetrating, becau&s;e they are
more contracted than tho&s;e of hot Water: <HI>for fire with
all its force, however applied and continued to Water, can
never divide its compenont particles, or make them &s;maller;
but, on the contrary, will enlarge their bulk, and &s;trongly
agitate them, one among another; and Water rendered as
cold as po&s;&s;ible, may pa&s;s through pores which it could not
enter while hot.</HI>&mdash;At any rate &s;uch an agitated mi&s;t will
produce an undulation in the air, which operating upon
the &s;urface of the body, will a&s;&s;i&s;t and promote a bri&s;k
circulation in the blood and animal juices.&mdash;In the neigh|bourhood
<PB N="13" REF="15">
of every <HI>Cataract,</HI> or <HI>Ca&s;cade,</HI> whether natural,
or artificial, there is, (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion,)
a cold, vapour Bath of this kind, which might be con|verted
to u&s;eful purpo&s;es, could the agitated &s;team be col|lected
in a proper receiver, without de&s;troying its motion,
and directed in full Stream to the part affected, whether
<HI>Ecchymo&s;is,</HI> indolent Tumor, or contracted Tendon.&mdash;We
known from <HI>Hydraulics,</HI> that &s;uch a &s;team is obtained, and
might be ea&s;ily and commodiou&s;ly conveyed by a tube three
hundred feet high, through which Water precipitated would
be &s;o broke and attenuated by the re&s;i&s;tance of the air,
and the &s;ides of the pipe, as to i&s;&s;ue at the lower end in
form of a thick mi&s;t: but this would not be the ca&s;e, if
the de&s;cent was le&s;s than three hundred feet; and there|fore,
the expedient is not likely to be tried.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ingified my opinion touching the u&s;e of
common Water in the <HI>cold Bath,</HI> and in <HI>Pumping;</HI> I &s;hall
now communicate my &s;entiments of the <HI>warm Bath,</HI> and
<HI>hot Fomentation,</HI> which, when properly u&s;ed, are certain|ly
very effectual remedies in many di&s;orders of the human
frame, even when the Water is free from all mineral im|pregnation.</P>
<P>Warm Water is of all fluids the mo&s;t mild and inoffen|&s;ive;
in&s;omuch, that, when applied to parts of the mo&s;t
exqui&s;ite feeling, it gives no pain; on the contrary, in
ulcerated Cancer$, when the nerves are corroded, laid
<PB N="14" REF="16">
bare, and &s;mart with every other application, this alone
mitigates the t$rture.</P>
<P>It is not my province to expatiate upon the virtues of
this element when u&s;ed internally; I &s;hall, therefore, li|mit
my ob&s;ervations to the outward u&s;e of it, in the differ|ent
forms of <HI>Pedil$viam, Semicupium, univer&s;al Bath,</HI> and
<HI>Fomentation.</HI> Bathing the feet in warm Water, is known
to be an efficacious remedy in the <HI>Head-ach, Vertigo,
c$nvu$&s;ive A&s;thma, dry Cough, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>hy&s;te|rical
Di$orders, Palpitations of the Heart, Ob&s;tructions
of the M$n&s;es,</HI> and all ca&s;es, where it is nece&s;&s;ary to make
a revul&s;ion from the head, and to invite the juices down|wards:
nay even in <HI>ardent inflammatory Fevers,</HI> I have
known it u&s;ed to great advantage, for taking off the
ten&s;ion and rigidity of the skin, a&s;&s;uaging the extreme
drought, and procuring &s;leep to the re&s;tle&s;s patient: Yet
this practice is condemned by a great many ingenious
Phy&s;icians, who affirm, that the heat, by rarifying the
blood increa&s;es the fever; and that the pre&s;&s;ure of the
Water upon the extremities, being eight hundred times
greater than that of Air, mu&s;t of con&s;equence drive the
contained fluids towards the head and heart with a mo&s;t
dangerous impetuo&s;ity: but, the re&s;i&s;tance of the fluids
is an over-match for this pre&s;&s;ure, great as it is; for it
will be found that the feet, even while immer&s;ed in the
Bath, are con&s;iderably &s;welled beyond their natural di|men&s;ions;
and this mu&s;t be entirely owing to a relaxa|tion
of the ve&s;&s;els; or at lea&s;t, to their di&s;ten&s;ion from
<PB N="15" REF="17">
an extraordinary <HI>Impetus</HI> of their contents.&mdash;After all,
it is a que&s;tion with me, whether the vapour of the <HI>Pe|diluvium,</HI>
may not contribute to its good effects, by act|ing
as a <HI>Fomentation,</HI> upon the parts of the body con|tiguous
to the Bath; for I have frequently ob&s;erved
that the &s;upplene&s;s and moi&s;ture of the skin, that ma|nife&s;t
a re&s;tored per&s;piration, begin to be perceivable
upon the legs and thighs of the patient, who has had
recour&s;e to this expedient.</P>
<P>The <HI>Semicupium</HI> has the advantage over the <HI>Pedilu|vium,</HI>
in many di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>Vi&s;cera:</HI> In <HI>Cholic Pains,</HI>
and <HI>&s;pa&s;modic Contractions</HI> of the inte&s;tinal canals, and in
violent con&s;trictions of the tender membranous tubes,
(&s;uch as the <HI>Ductus Cy&s;ticus, Ureters</HI> and <HI>Urethra</HI>) when
they are blocked up and irritated by rough and angular
concretions.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t effectual u&s;e of the warm Bath, is &s;up|po&s;ed
to be that wherein the whole body is immer&s;ed: In|deed,
the warm Bath is &s;o well under&s;tood in its Ano|dyne
capacity, that every body (almo&s;t) after the fatigue
of a journey, or other hard exerci&s;e, has recour&s;e to the
Bagnio for refre&s;hment: and &s;o agreeable is the opera$ion
of this medicine, that in ancient times, as well as in
the&s;e days, it has been con&s;idered as a point of luxury
and plea&s;ure; witne&s;s tho&s;e magnificent Baths of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI>
de&s;cribed by <HI>Pli$y, Vitruvius,</HI> and other eminent
writers of antiquity: together with the con&s;tant practice
<PB N="16" REF="18">
of many modern voluptuaries.&mdash;Nothing, &s;urely, yields
a more ea&s;y &s;en&s;ation than that which we feel in a Bath
of pure, &s;imple Water moderately warm: that expan&s;ion
of nervous <HI>Fibrillae</HI> &s;tretched to almo&s;t every point in the
&s;urface of the body, is, as it were, unbended into a plea|&s;ing
&s;tate of relaxation; and a charming indolence or
<HI>Languor</HI> &s;teals upon the &s;pirits.</P>
<P>The warm Bath conduces to the re&s;toration of health,
by rendring the rigid fibres more pliable and &s;upple; by
wa&s;hing away tho&s;e unctuous and <HI>acrid</HI> impurities, which
are apt to ob&s;truct the pores, corrode the nerves and di&s;|order
the per&s;piration; by enlarging the openings of the
cuticular &s;trainer, and inviting the fluids towards the &s;ur|face;
by reviving the natural heat, and cau&s;ing an <HI>O&s;cil|latory</HI>
motion, which will re&s;tore to parts that are cold,
in&s;en&s;ible and contracted, their former warmth, functions
and flexibility: and in a languid circulation, proceeding
from a <HI>Vi&s;cidity</HI> of the juices, the warm Bath will be
&s;erviceable by encrea&s;ing the velocity of the blood,
which is agitated and attenuated by the rarefaction of the
heat within, and the pre&s;&s;ure of the Water without the
ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>From the&s;e effects of the warm Bath, it mu&s;t be &s;a|lutary
in <HI>paralytic Di&s;orders, contracted Sinews, &s;pa&s;modic
Affections</HI> of the <HI>Nerves, hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>hy&s;terical
Ca&s;es,</HI> Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Men&s;es, Haemorrhoids</HI> and <HI>Per|$piration;</HI>
the Scurvy, venereal Di&s;temper, and all di&s;ea&s;es,
<PB N="17" REF="19">
the cau&s;es of which are to be di&s;charged through the
<HI>Emunctories</HI> of the skin; accordingly there is often an a|mazing
quantity of foul humours, expelled into the <HI>Bath</HI>
from this outlet. In the <HI>German</HI> Mi&s;cellanies, we read
of a woman afflicted with a pain in her loins, who after
having tried other remedies in vain, found nothing gave
her &s;o much relief as warm Bathing, upon the u&s;e of
which, a gro&s;s, <HI>unctuous</HI> matter was found floating upon
the water, and might have been taken off with a &s;poon.
There is likewi&s;e another hi&s;tory of an <HI>hypochondriacal</HI>
man, who upon u&s;ing the warm <HI>Bath,</HI> found al&s;o &s;uch a
&s;cum, which grew every day more and more <HI>corro&s;ive,</HI>
and &s;melled &s;o foetid, that they were obliged to infu&s;e
fre&s;h herbs to correct the noi&s;ome &s;tench, as well as the
<HI>Acrimony</HI> of the water, which even affected the hand
of the rubber; and this <HI>Excretion</HI> continued until the
patient was quite recovered. Indeed, (as Dr. <HI>Shaw</HI>
ob&s;erves) &s;uch an <HI>unctuous</HI> matter is ob&s;ervable in
the <HI>Baths</HI> at Bagnios, after they have been u&s;ed by
per&s;ons apparently in health.&mdash;Among the Ancients, this
remedy was always applied to tho&s;e who were bit by a
mad dog, even after they were &s;eized with the <HI>Hydro|phobia;</HI>
and <HI>Hoffman,</HI> from the information of a phy|&s;ician
of <HI>Duder&s;tad,</HI> gives an account of a mad wolf,
that coming out of the woods, bit &s;everal per&s;ons, who
died of the bite; till at length, by the advice of an ordi|nary
man, &s;ome others who had met with the &s;ame mis|fortune,
had recour&s;e to the u&s;e of a moderately hot
Bath; having fir&s;t taken a do&s;e of <HI>Theriaca Veneta,</HI> and
<PB N="18" REF="20">
the $word$ of the <HI>Dog-R$&s;e;</HI> and by the&s;e means repeat|ed
every day, were delivered from the terrible con&s;e|quences
of the poi&s;on. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that
in the&s;e ca&s;es, part of the credit of the cure, was due
to the <HI>Sp$ngia Cynorr$odi,</HI> which is a very powerful <HI>Diu|retick,</HI>
and of &s;uch $fficacy in a great many di&s;tempers,
as to have obtained in <HI>Sicily,</HI> the epither of <HI>Sanatados</HI>
or <HI>All-h$al.</HI>&mdash;And here it will not be un&s;ea&s;onable to
ob&s;erve the difference of practice among the ancients, as
well as moderns, in treating patients bit by a mad dog,
with regard to the article of Bathing.&mdash;<HI>Cel&s;us</HI> &s;ays, that
&s;ome practitioners of his time, ordered the patient imme|diately
into the warm <HI>Bath,</HI> that he might &s;weat plenti|fully,
while his &s;trength was &s;ufficient to undergo that
evacuation, and that the poi&s;on might have an opportu|nity
to di&s;til from the open wound; then he was re|galed
with a good quantity of Sheer wine, which they
con&s;idered as an antidote to all poi&s;ons; and by this me|thod
repeated for three days, he was &s;uppo&s;ed to be out
of all danger: but <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> him&s;elf orders the wound to be
<HI>cupped,</HI> then <HI>cauterized</HI> or &s;eared (if the part is not ner|vous
or tendinous) and afterwards treated as a common
<HI>Burn.</HI>&mdash;In the <HI>Hydr$phobia,</HI> which he looks upon as a
very dangerous &s;ymptom, he &s;ays, the only remedy is to
plunge the patient unawares into a fi&s;h-pond, and duck
him in it &s;everal times, &s;o as that he &s;hall be compelled
to &s;wallow a great quantity of the Water; by which his
thir&s;t may be quenched, and his abhorrence of the fluid
at the &s;ame time removed.&mdash;Thi$ practice of almo&s;t drown|ing
<PB N="19" REF="21">
the patient, Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> ob&s;erves, was revived in the begin|ing
of the la&s;t century; and though he thinks &s;uch &s;eve|rity
altogether unrea&s;onable, he pre&s;cribes the cold <HI>Bath</HI>
to be u&s;ed for a con&s;iderable length of time, from the ac|cident
of the bite; and a&s;cribes its efficacy to the pre&s;&s;ure
of the Water upon the &s;urface of the body, and the con|&s;triction
the cold makes upon the fibres of the skin and
the &s;mall tubes; whereby the di&s;ten&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els by
the fermenting humours is repre&s;&s;ed; and a flux of urine
promoted for &s;o many days, that all danger of the ner|vous
fever, the con&s;equent of the in&s;tilled poi&s;on, is quite
over. He likewi&s;e, in this ca&s;e, condemns the u&s;e of the
Warm <HI>Bath,</HI> as productive of an inflammatory heat, which
occa&s;ions a dangerous di&s;ten&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els. But how
&s;hall we reconcile this opinion with that of the accurate,
the experienced <HI>Hoffman,</HI> who pronounces the u&s;e of the
Cold Bath, precarious and uncertain, and recommends
Warm Bathing as &s;erviceable in bringing the &s;ubtile Ve|$$m
to the &s;urface of the body, where it finds a free exit?
I believe both the one and the other may be &s;ucce&s;sfully
u&s;ed on this occa&s;ion, under proper cautions and re&s;tric|tions.
Warm Bathing, in the beginning, will relax the
fibres, widen the &s;trainer of the &s;kin, quicken the circula|tion,
and promote the &s;ecretions of urine and &s;weat, by
which the <HI>Virus</HI> may be di&s;charged before it has had time
to produce any dangerous di&s;ten&s;ion of the ve&s;&s;els; and
even after the <HI>Hydrophobia</HI> hath begun to rage it may be
&s;erviceable in relaxing and removing that convul&s;ive con|&s;triction
of the nerves, which prevails in divers parts of
<PB N="20" REF="22">
the body, and is the immediate cau&s;e of that direful &s;ym|ptom;
while, at the &s;ame time, it may &s;ollicit a critical
evacuation from the &s;kin, or &s;ome other emunctory of the
body, without di&s;tending the ve&s;&s;els beyond a po&s;&s;ibility
of retrieving their tone.&mdash;On the other hand, a &s;udden
immer&s;ion into Cold water communicates a &s;pring to the
whole nervous &s;y&s;tem, by which the &s;olids are &s;trengthen|ed,
contracted, and &s;timulated, to propell the juices with
additional force, the velocity of the blood is increa&s;ed;
con&s;equently all the &s;ecretions are augmented, and a glow|ing
warmth being generated on the &s;urface of the &s;kin, is
commonly followed by a profu&s;e &s;weat: thus the ve&s;&s;els
are &s;upported again&s;t the rarefaction &s;uppo&s;ed to be pro|duced
by the <HI>Virus,</HI> which may likewi&s;e be expelled a|mong
the promoted &s;ecretions of the body: but I am far
from thinking it unnece&s;&s;ary to harra&s;s and affright the
patient in the Cold <HI>Bath:</HI> for, if the intention is to induce
a &s;trong contraction in the &s;olids, nothing more effectually
accompli&s;hes that aim, than &s;uch treatment as in&s;pires the
pa&s;&s;ions of anger and fear. There is upon record, a fa|mous
in&s;tance of a lady of very high rank, who was cured
of the <HI>Pal&s;y</HI> by an affront and mortification purpo&s;ely of|fered
to her pride, whereby &s;he was &s;eized with a fever of
indignation.&mdash;I have known a gentleman who was <HI>para|lytic</HI>
to a deplorable degree, enraged to a perfect u&s;e of all
his limbs, while his anger predominated: I have &s;een per|&s;ons
under the influence of a <HI>Pannic,</HI> ex$rt their mu&s;cles
in an incredible manner; and in &s;ome parts of this i&s;land
it hath been a common practice in the <HI>Mania</HI> and bite of
<PB N="21" REF="23">
the mad dog, to reinforce the power of the Cold <HI>Bath,</HI>
by &s;hutting up the patient alone, and properly &s;ecured, in a
&s;$litary church, where his fancy might be haunted all
night long, with images of &s;uper&s;titious terror.</P>
<P>But, to return to Warm Bathing: the u&s;e of it is in no|thing
more &s;ucce&s;sful, than in <HI>maniac</HI> di&s;orders, whether
of the melancholy or frantic &s;pecies: both the&s;e are owing
to a di&s;ordered circulation in the brain, occa&s;ioned by a
thick foul vi&s;co&s;ity in the juices, which, by a nervous con|&s;trict$on
of the lower parts, are forcibly driven upwards,
yielding an impure and interrupted &s;ecretion of the animal
&s;pirits, and di&s;turbing their containing ve&s;&s;els, &s;o as to cre|ate
various <HI>Chimaeras</HI> in the imagination. In this ca&s;e,
the Warm Bath is eminently &s;erviceable, by <HI>&s;oftening,
&s;uppling, and relaxing the nervous parts, opening by its
warmth and moi&s;ture, the cold and hardened skin, and thus
deriving the cour&s;e of the blood upon the habit of the body,
and giving it a free and general circulation.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Hoffman,</HI> who is very full in the prai&s;es of this reme|dy,
ob&s;erves, that, in ca&s;es of madne&s;s, he had pre&s;cribed
it with &s;urpri&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s, after <HI>Bleeaing, nitrous</HI> and <HI>dilut|ing</HI>
medicines; and wonders, that a practice &s;o much de|pended
upon by the ancients, &s;hould be almo&s;t entirely
neglected by the phy&s;icians of the&s;e days. <HI>Hippocrates,
Galen, Cel&s;us, and the m$thodi&s;ts, held the u&s;e of Bathing
in great e&s;teem for the cure o$ f$vers, e&s;pecially of the in|termitting
kind; and this chi$fly in the interval between
<PB N="22" REF="24">
$word$ fits, or when the fit is going off; or even in the
beginning of an ardent fever.</HI> In this la&s;t circum&s;tance
it is admini&s;tred to this day by the <HI>Negroes</HI> in the
We&s;t-Indies, the <HI>Bath</HI> being medicated with emollient
herbs, which enrich the Water with a mucilage that adds
to its &s;oftening and relaxing virtues. By the&s;e means a
vent is often procured for the ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, be|fore
the heat occa&s;ioned by its detention hath increa&s;ed &s;o
as to produce a total putrefaction of the juices.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e u&s;es of the Warm Bath, it is of great &s;ervice
in promoting delivery, by relaxing the parts in tho&s;e wo|men
who are turned of thirty before the fir&s;t child; and
in &s;uch as are naturally contracted in con&s;equence of a ri|gid
fibre, and robu&s;t con&s;titution, which is the ca&s;e with
all tho&s;e healthy young women, of a florid complexion,
who live in the country, and are u&s;ed to hard exerci&s;e;
in&s;omuch that a country practitioner told me, he found
great difficulty in delivering his patients, until he had re|cour&s;e
to the Warm <HI>Bath,</HI> for relaxing and rendering the
parts more dilatable.</P>
<P>Having con&s;idered the&s;e effects of the Warm Bath, con|&s;i&s;ting
of pure Water only. I am inclined to believe, that
the Mineral Principles in Hot Springs, have often, in the
cure of patients by Bathing, u&s;urped that prai&s;e and repu|tation
which was really due to the &s;imple element; and
that the external u&s;e of common Water, properly warmed,
would have the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, effect in the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
gout, which an ingenious phy&s;ician attributes to the <HI>&s;apo|nac$ous</HI>
and <HI>&s;ulp$urcous Parti$les</HI> with which the Waters
of <HI>Bath</HI> are impregnated&mdash;That a <HI>Pedduvium</HI> made of
good &s;oft Water warmed, is of &s;ervice in &s;olliciting the
gouty matter to the extremities, is an inconte&s;tible truth;
and, doubtle&s;s, the operation of its heat upon the contain|ed
fluids, may produce &s;uch a gentle fever as will be &s;uffi|cient
to <HI>grind</HI> that matter &s;mall enough to circulate thro'
the finer pa&s;&s;ages, in order to be di&s;charged by &s;weat,
urine, or &s;tool.&mdash;</P>
<P>How&s;oever minute and volatile tho&s;e Mineral Particles
may be, I very much que&s;tion, whether they will find ea&s;y
admi&s;&s;ion into the blood, by the &s;mall <HI>inbaling</HI> ve&s;&s;els of
the skin, while they are confined in a ponderous fluid, that
&s;urrounds the &s;urface of the body, and by a con&s;iderable pre&s;|&s;ure,
<HI>quaquaver&s;um,</HI> blocks up the very pores through which
only they can enter; and &s;uch ob&s;truction may be increa&s;ed
by the a&s;tringency which tho&s;e Minerals impart to the Waters
of the Bath: &s;o that, in&s;tead of opening, &s;oftening, relaxing,
and purifying, they will, (exclu&s;ive of their additional weight
and pre&s;&s;ure, which are greater in the&s;e than in common
Water,) be apt to contract the pores, cri&s;p up the fibres,
harden the &s;urface of the skin, and leave upon it a &s;ort of
mineral cru&s;t, which may corrode, and hurt, the tender,
nervous papillae, produce a di&s;agreeable itching and heat,
and totally di&s;order the per&s;piration. As to the volatile
parts in which the chief virtues re&s;ide, they are continu|ally
flying off in a perpendicular direction; &s;o that they
<PB N="24" REF="26">
can have little effect upon the body <HI>immer&s;ed.</HI>&mdash;This
&s;uppo&s;ition is partly confirmed by experiment: for there
are many hot &s;ulphureous Wells upon the continent, in
which a piece of &s;ilver being <HI>immer&s;ed,</HI> will receive no
&s;tain; whereas, when &s;u&s;pended over the &s;team of the
&s;ame Waters, it &s;oon acquires a fine yellow colour. Mr.
<HI>Boyle,</HI> in his hi&s;tory of air, &s;ays he found a certain metal
more &s;uddenly and evidently affected, by being &s;u&s;tained
in the air, over the fumes of a <HI>men&s;truum,</HI> than it was
when totally covered by the <HI>m$n&s;truum</HI> it&s;elf: and it is
commonly ob&s;erved, that in a moi&s;t air, occa&s;ioned by a
plentiful evaporation, iron guns will contract ru&s;t in a
&s;horter time, and much larger quantity, than if they were
actually &s;unk in &s;ea Water.&mdash;The&s;e ob&s;ervations, though
they do not altogether di&s;prove the common notions of a
Mineral Hot <HI>Bath,</HI> at lea&s;t invalidate its &s;uppo&s;ed effects;
and plainly demon&s;trate, that the &s;ubtile and volatile
parts are more efficaciou&s;ly communicated in <HI>Vapour</HI> or
<HI>Fomentation,</HI> which is the method of u&s;ing the Waters,
which we now come to con&s;ider.</P>
<P>The ancients u&s;ed the <HI>Vapour Bath</HI> compo&s;ed of natu|ral
Hot Steams, which, ri&s;ing from the earth, were received
under a proper Arch, or Hot-hou&s;e: but this was &s;olely with
a view to procure &s;weat; for which purpo&s;e they al&s;o had
recour&s;e to a dry heat, &s;uch as Hot Sand, Hor&s;e Dung,
Stove Rooms, and artificial Bagnios; together with the
method of <HI>in&s;olation,</HI> in which the patient was expo&s;ed to
<PB N="25" REF="27">
the &s;un-beams, that they might exhale the peccant hu|mours
in &s;ome chronical di&s;tempers.</P>
<P><HI>Fomentation</HI> is &s;o frequently u&s;ed, and &s;o well under|&s;tood,
in all external in&s;lammations, that it would be &s;u|perfluous
to de&s;cribe either the manner of applying <HI>Stu|pes,</HI>
or the common di&s;orders in which they are benefi|cial.
They have often &s;topt the progre&s;s of a <HI>Gangrenc,</HI>
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the <HI>ven$real Phimo&s;is,</HI> and <HI>Hernia humoralis,</HI>
and allayed the pain, and removed the ten&s;ion of the <HI>Ery|&s;ipelas:</HI>
the Vapour of hot Water, breathing through the
pores of a bladder, hath a&s;&s;uaged the torture of the <HI>pleu|ritic
Stitch,</HI> and even di&s;&s;olved its cau&s;e; and the <HI>Angina</HI>
is often cured by the &s;team of this fluid, received into the
mouth, through a <HI>Funnel,</HI> or the &s;pout of a tea-kettle,
under the cover of a blanket, which, by detaining the <HI>Ef|fluvia,</HI>

<P>That this <HI>Vapour</HI> is a mo&s;t powerful di&s;&s;olvent, is in|di&s;putably

harde&s;t bone into the con&s;i&s;tence of a jelly: nor is the effi|cacy
<PB N="26" REF="28">
of this <HI>Vapour</HI> upon the human body, to be wonder|ed
at, when we con&s;ider into what minute particles that
fluid is divi&s;ible, and what millions of <HI>inhaling Ve&s;&s;els</HI>
gape upon the &s;urface of the skin: for, according to <HI>Leeu|wenb$$c$</HI>'s

<P>The &s;team of hot Water therefore, not only relaxes the

to pa&s;s, but, al&s;o acts as a <HI>diluent,</HI> after having in&s;inuated
it&s;elf into the circulation: for, with re&s;pect to the <HI>fluids</HI>
of the human body, nothing is &s;o powerful in <HI>diluting</HI> and
<HI>atte$uating,</HI> as Water, which, in the language of the <HI>A|depts,</HI>
being changed by the <HI>Seminale Principium,</HI> is the
univer&s;al <HI>Cement</HI> of all things, and that, into which, by the
efforts of nature and of art, all things may be re&s;olved:
but, over and above the&s;e effects, the <HI>Vapour,</HI> in relaxing
the ve&s;&s;els, le&s;&s;ens their re&s;i&s;tance, by which means, the
circulating juices flow thither with increa&s;ed <HI>Momentum,</HI>
and &s;weep before them all remains of the ob&s;tructed mat|ter;
accordingly, we &s;ee the part begin to &s;well and red|den,

<P>The &s;team of common Water is enriched by the infu&s;i|on
of vegetables, as well as by the &s;olution of &s;alts: for all
the fine, <HI>aromatic</HI> particles of vegetables are <HI>volatile,</HI> and
continually flying off; con&s;equently adapted for entering
the &s;malle&s;t order of ve&s;&s;els, along with the <HI>Vapours</HI> in

<HI>acid</HI> and <HI>urinous</HI> &s;alts.&mdash;The air is always impregnated
with the finer parts, and native &s;pirit of tho&s;e vegetables
that grow upon the &s;urface of the earth: thus, while we

<HI>aromatic</HI> plants and trees, we are regaled with their <HI>odori|ferous
exhalations,</HI> even at a great di&s;tance from the &s;hore.
Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> from the report of an ingenious phy&s;ician, in|forms
us, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> having de&s;troyed almo&s;t all the

to enhance the value of their &s;pice, &s;uch a change in the
temper of the air immediately en&s;ued, as plainly proved,
that the <HI>aromatic Fragrance,</HI> exhaled from the blo&s;&s;oms
of tho&s;e trees, had corrected the natural unwhole&s;omne&s;s
of the clime, for the whole i&s;land became very unhealthy;
a circum&s;tance (as the phy&s;ician imagined) owing to the
<HI>corro&s;ive</HI> &s;teams of a <HI>Vulcano,</HI> the ill effects of which had
been prevented by the &s;picy <HI>Effluvia</HI> of the trees.&mdash;The
<HI>Volatility</HI> of many &s;alts is perfectly well known: that there
are numberle&s;s <HI>&s;aline Corpu&s;cles</HI> floating in the air, is
proved by a thou&s;and different experiments: the <HI>Vehicle</HI>

of all the&s;e is Water; and many more which the &s;un

con&s;picuous, than in tho&s;e <HI>Th$rmae,</HI> or hot Springs, which

<PB N="29" REF="31">
Though this very &s;ubtile &s;pirit is, in part, di&s;&s;ipated by the
heat of the <HI>Thermae,</HI> yet the <HI>Vapour</HI> of tho&s;e hot Waters is
certainly impregnated with <HI>&s;ulphurcous</HI> particles, or a <HI>volatile
Vitri$l of Iron,</HI> which cannot fail to operate powerfully
on the &s;urface of the human body, and introduce them|&s;elves

is &s;urcharged with <HI>Sulphur</HI> to &s;uch a degree, as to
be very offen&s;ive to tender lungs; and tho&s;e <HI>Vertigos</HI> and
<HI>Palpitations</HI> with which &s;ome of the Bathers are &s;eized,
may be partly owing to the <HI>Mineral Effluvia</HI> operating
upon the nervous membrane of the no&s;e, as well as to the
heat and pre&s;&s;ure upon the parts that are immer&s;ed.</P>
<P>By this time, you will have perceived the whole of my
opinion, to $ching the external u&s;e of mi$eral Waters, whe|ther
<HI>Acidulae,</HI> or <HI>Thermae:</HI> that, in point of Bathing, they
are not preferable, not even equal to pure &s;imple element,
except in tho&s;e ca&s;es, where their <HI>&s;typtic</HI> or <HI>a&s;tringent</HI> qua|lity
may be of &s;ervice, namely in &s;ome particular kinds of
ulcers, and <HI>oedematous</HI> &s;wellings; and that, in general, the
mo&s;t effectual way of applying them externally is in form
of <HI>Vapour,</HI> whether conveyed to one particular part, or
extended to the whole &s;urface of the skin: yet this method,
&s;o &s;afe and &s;alutary, approved by every phy&s;ician of can|dour,
learning, and experience, hath never been practi&s;ed
at <HI>Bath,</HI> which is the great ho&s;pital of the nation, frequent|ed
by almo&s;t all the valetudinarians who&s;e lives are of any
<PB N="30" REF="32">
con&s;equence to the commonwealth. This defect, together
with the inconveniences and danger that attend tho&s;e who
bathe in this place, mu&s;t occur at once to a judicious ob|&s;erver:
neverthele&s;s, they have been overlooked with the
mo&s;t &s;upercilious and willful neglect by the Corporation,
which has even rejected the earne&s;t and repeated remon|&s;trances
of tho&s;e who have tasked their ingenuity to con|trive
&s;chemes for rendering their Waters more &s;afe and &s;er|viceable.&mdash;The
&s;ame indolence, or indifference, prevails
among the managers and directors of their ho&s;pital: for,
although, in the plan which was handed about to &s;ollicit
&s;ub&s;criptions, they ob&s;erved, that, by the execution of it,
many pari&s;hes would be ca&s;ed of the burthen of their poor
cripples; that the knowledge and u&s;e of the Bath Waters
would be greatly improved, to the benefit of all &s;ucceed|ing
generations; and that the ho&s;pital would, in a few
years, furni&s;h more hi&s;tories of ca&s;es that might be de|pended
upon, than could po&s;&s;ibly occur in private prac|tice,
during a whole age; the public hath not, as yet,
been favoured with the hi&s;tory of one cure performed un|der
the au&s;pices of that charity. Dr. <HI>Summers,</HI> phy&s;ician
in that place, hath indeed, of late, publi&s;hed an accurate
account of the &s;ucce&s;s of Warm B$thing in paralytic di&s;|orders,
and, from the books of the ho&s;pital, favoured us
with a li&s;t of all the paralytic patients who have received
benefit from the u&s;e of the Bath. So far the public is ob|liged
to that gentleman: but, as he him&s;elf ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,
the &s;ame public <HI>hath a right to be informed how far their
$word$ intentions have been an&s;wered; and what good their
<PB N="31" REF="33">
Benevolence has produced:</HI> and this information can only
be conveyed in a &s;$ccinct detail of all the ca&s;es in which
the Warm Bath has proved &s;erviceable or deterimental.
Many people were induced to contribute largely, by the&s;e
arguments which were equally &s;olid and &s;pecious: from
the regularity of patients in an ho&s;pital, they hoped to &s;ee
the u&s;es and virtues of the Waters a&s;certained; and did not
doubt that their &s;ucce&s;s upon &s;uch as were re&s;tricted to the
mo&s;t exact regimen, under the immediate eye and direc|tion
of phy&s;icians, would encourage others to imitate the
&s;ame regularity, and, of con&s;equence, bring a greater con|cour&s;e
of people to <HI>Bath.</HI>&mdash;A &s;atisfaction of this kind, is
what the public, in general, has rea&s;on to expect, and every
&s;ub&s;criber, in particular, a right to demand; and that the
world hath been hitherto di&s;appointed on this &s;core, mu&s;t
be owing to a &s;hameful lazine&s;s in tho&s;e who belong to the
ho&s;pital, in a medical capacity; or to a re&s;erve in the di|rectors,
which is equally unaccountable and unju&s;t, and
very ill becomes the tru&s;tees of a voluntary &s;ub&s;cription.</P>
<P>In the progre&s;s of may inquiries, touching the external
u&s;e of the Bath Waters, I under&s;tood that the phy&s;icians
and &s;urgeons re&s;iding at that place, had pre&s;ented a me|morial
to the mayor, and corporation, de&s;iring they would
petition the parliament, to enable them to make &s;everal
alterations in the Baths, which are nece&s;&s;ary for the good
of the public. To this memorial they received an an|&s;wer,
importing that they would by no means apply to
parliament, but, &s;o far as their own power extended, do
<PB N="32" REF="34">
every thing for the advantage and improvement of the
Baths; and they de&s;ired that tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary alterations
&s;hould be &s;pecified. Accordingly, the gentlemen of the
faculty held another con&s;ultation, at which Mr. <HI>Cl$land,</HI>
Surgeon, pre&s;ented a plan for that purpo&s;e, which was
read, and referred to the report of a committee appointed
to examine the particulars of it, with more attention. De|&s;irous
of knowing the nature of the&s;e propo&s;ed alterations,
I addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to that gentleman, whom I found to
be of a very communicative di&s;po&s;ition; he not only fa|voured
me with a copy of his plan, which, for the &s;atis|faction
of the public, &s;hall (by his permi&s;&s;ion) be printed
as an appendix to this e&s;&s;ay, but, al&s;o, communicated to
me, the remarks he had made on the Bath, and a very
ingenious apparatus he had contrived, for &s;ome complaints
peculiar to the fair &s;ex, as well as for &s;weating any parti|cular
part of the body, with the &s;team or vapour of tho&s;e
Waters. This was a piece of &s;atisfaction he had never re|fu&s;ed
to any per&s;on of the lea&s;t con&s;ideration, whether a
foreigner, or of our own country. The machinery, to|gether
with the former propo&s;als he had offered to the
&s;ame intent, had been approved of by mo&s;t of the learned
men in <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Bath,</HI> and pre&s;ented to His late Roy|al
Highne&s;s the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> by who&s;e command they
were &s;ent to Mr. <HI>Na&s;h,</HI> with a de&s;ire that he would lay
them before the corporation, in his name&mdash;Yet, notwith|&s;tanding
&s;uch powerful recommendation, the plan was ne|ver
executed: on the contrary, a mo&s;t rancourous &s;pirit
of oppo&s;ition was rai&s;ed again&s;t the author, who&s;e reputa|tion
<PB N="33" REF="35">
with the public could not fail to excite the malevo|lence
of &s;ome narrow-minded people of the profe&s;&s;ion,
who had acquired plentiful fortunes by their practice,
without having made one improvement for the benefit of
their own patients, or the advantage of mankind: no
wonder, then, that they &s;hould take umbrage at Mr. <HI>Cle|land</HI>'s
pre&s;uming to contrive methods for making the Wa|ters
more &s;afe and effectual, and endeavour to prevent the
&s;ucce&s;s of his plan. The cruel treatment he underwent
upon that occa&s;ion, compelled him to appeal to the pub|lic,
and the whole conte&s;t betwixt him and his adver&s;aries
appeared in print; when he was allowed, by every unpre|judiced
per&s;on, to have greatly the advantage in the di&s;|pute.
At la&s;t, his enemies had recour&s;e to the pen of an
author as notorious for the &s;ervile homage he yields to his
patrons, as for the in&s;olence and &s;currility with which he
treats all the world be&s;ides. True to the&s;e principles, this
champion publi&s;hed an anonymous letter to Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI>
wherein, after a chain of fal&s;e rea&s;oning, twanged off in all
the arrogance of expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ome aukward attempts to iro|nical
humour, and the mo&s;t abu&s;ive low &s;arca&s;ms, levelled
at a lady of di&s;tinction, and, indeed, at a whole nation,
on her account, he takes it for granted, that he has fully
proved the truth of his unju&s;t allegations. This author
mu&s;t have entertained a very contemptible idea of the un|der&s;tanding
and judgment of the public, if he hoped to
impo&s;e upon them by &s;uch an effu&s;ion of idle &s;ophi&s;try, in
the cour&s;e of which, he is even driven to the &s;ubterfuge of
making fal&s;e quotations: but his talents, as a commen|tator,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
are &s;o well under&s;tood, and &s;o ju&s;tly celebrated, that
he had nothing further to fear for his reputation on that
&s;core.</P>
<P>That the reader may di&s;tinctly perceive the nece&s;&s;ity of
reforming tho&s;e Baths, I &s;hall here enumerate the incon|veniencies
that attend the pre&s;ent method of u&s;ing the Wa|ters
externally; the knowledge of which, I, in a great
mea&s;ure, owe to the information of Mr. <HI>Cleland.</HI></P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons of all ages, &s;exes, and conditions, are
promi&s;cuou&s;ly admitted into an open Bath, which affords
little or no &s;helter from the inclemencies of the weather,
&s;uch as wind, rain, hail, and &s;now: for, by the peculiar
&s;agacity of the learned in that place, the bathing time is
limited to the mo&s;t &s;evere &s;ea&s;on of the year. This being
the ca&s;e, it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that many of the
fair &s;ex are withheld by mode&s;ty from going into the Bath,
where they mu&s;t not only mingle with male patients, to
who&s;e per&s;ons and complaints they are utter &s;trangers;
but, likewi&s;e, be expo&s;ed in a very mortifying point of
view, to the eyes of all the company, in the Pump-room,
as well as to tho&s;e of the footmen and common people,
who&s;e curio&s;ity leads them to look over the walls of the
Bath: &s;ome may be apprehen&s;ive of being tainted with in|fectious
di&s;tempers; or di&s;gu&s;ted with the nau&s;eating ap|pearances
of the filth, which, being wa&s;hed from the bo|dies
of the patients, is left &s;ticking to the &s;ides of the
place.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
Although the king's and queen's Baths have been known
to contain five-and-forty patients at one time, the number
of guides does not exceed half a dozen of each &s;ex; &s;o
that if any of tho&s;e Bathers who are unattended &s;hould be
&s;eized with a &s;udden <HI>Vertigo,</HI> fit, or other accident, they
might lo&s;e their lives for want of proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But,
granting no &s;uch accident &s;hould happen, &s;ome of them,
on retiring from the Bath, mu&s;t, from this defect in point
of attendance, remain in the wet bathing dre&s;s, until their
con&s;titutions are greatly endangered. This inconvenience
is rendered more grievous by the nature of that dre&s;s,
which, being made of canvas, grows cold and clammy in
a moment, and clings to the &s;urface of the body with a
mo&s;t hazardous adhe&s;ion. If they &s;hould e&s;cape the con|&s;equences
of both the&s;e ri&s;ques, they may &s;till be &s;ubject to
another, in being obliged to wait in a cold &s;lip for their
re&s;pective chairs, which cannot always be brought to them
in proper time, becau&s;e the pa&s;&s;age is frequently blocked
up. After all, they are carried to their lodgings, while
their pores are open from the effects of the Bath, in paul|try
chairs made of &s;light cro&s;s bars of wood, fa&s;tened to|gether
with girth web, covered with bays, and, for the
mo&s;t part, de&s;titute of lining: the&s;e machines, by &s;tanding
in the &s;treet till called for, are often rendered &s;o damp by
the weather, that the Bathers cannot u&s;e them without
imminent hazard of their lives.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="38">
The &s;lips, or places for undre&s;&s;ing, are not only too few
in number, but, al&s;o, cold, damp, uncomfortable, and al|together
improper for the u&s;e to which they are put; and,
la&s;tly, the fine volatile parts of the Mineral are &s;uffered to
evaporate, without being converted to any medical u&s;e.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations it plainly appears, that tho&s;e
patients who are deprived of the u&s;e of their limbs, and in|capable
of helping them&s;elves, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to great in|convenience
and danger; and that, in all probability, many
per&s;ons of a delicate frame, and timorous di&s;po&s;ition, are
altogether deterred from that way of u&s;ing the Waters;
for the&s;e evils are not frivolous, or chimerical: every day
are heard complaints of the bad effects of Bathing; and if
the&s;e are minutely inquired into, they will be found (for
the mo&s;t part) to proceed, not from the Water it&s;elf, but
from the inconveniencies attending the manner of Bathing.
I my&s;elf, who have had very little opportunity of &s;eeing the
immediate con&s;equences of the Bath, could produce &s;eve|ral
in&s;tances in which the patient's lungs were dangerou&s;|ly
affected by Cold, caught either in the Bath, in dre&s;|ing,
or in waiting for a chair.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> urged by the&s;e con&s;iderations, formed an
ea&s;y and rational plan for rendering the Baths more &s;afe
and commodious; and, as I have already ob&s;erved, con|trived
an apparatus for confining the vapour, and directing
it in full &s;team to any part of the body, as the exigency of
<PB N="37" REF="39">
the ca&s;e might require; a method of application which is,
of all others, undoubtedly, the mo&s;t effectual, in the ex|ternal
u&s;e of medicated Waters. He invented a clo&s;e
warm chair, for conveying the patients to and from the
Bath, which hath &s;ince been imitated by the governors of
the ho&s;pital, as well as by many of the chairmen who ply
in the &s;treets; and he propo&s;ed that a Bagnio &s;hould be
erected with proper conveniencies for Cupping, Sweating,
Bathing, Pumping, and Fomentation, and &s;upplied by a
pipe from the kitchen or re&s;ervoir of the king's Bath. Such
an improvement would afford a &s;afe, ea&s;y, and agreeable
accommodation to any of the royal family, who may, (as
heretofore) have occa&s;ion for the Waters; as well as to the
nobility and gentry, and tho&s;e who want to refre&s;h them|&s;elves
after the fatigue of a journey. People of remark|able
delicacy, either in &s;entiment, or con&s;titution, might
here receive the benefit of the Waters, in the mo&s;t effectu|al
manner, and avoid all the dangerous and di&s;agreeable
circum&s;tances of bathing in the open air: for it would be
an ea&s;y matter to temper the fluid to &s;uch a degree of
Warmth or Heat as might be nece&s;&s;ary to the ca&s;e of eve|ry
particular patient; whereas, at pre&s;ent, all the Bathers
are obliged to undergo the &s;ame degree of heat, tho' the
various nature of their complaints, and con&s;titutions, may
require a very e&s;&s;ential difference.</P>
<P>Though the intere&s;t of the corporation was evidently
connected with the execution of this &s;cheme, in order to
leave them ab&s;olutely without excu&s;e, Mr. <HI>Cleland</HI> offered
to erect &s;uch a Bagnio at his own expence, and pay yearly
<PB N="38" REF="40">
into the chamber of <HI>Bath,</HI> a rea&s;onable con&s;ideration for
the u&s;e of their Water; or, if they would be at the charge
of building one according to his plan, to take a long lea&s;e
of it, at a certain yearly rent; to di&s;cover all his contri|vances
for topical Fomentation; and to exert him&s;elf, to
the be&s;t of his power, for the advantage of the place.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;als, di&s;intere&s;ted, ju&s;t, and rea&s;onable as
they are, which contain the mo&s;t plain, ea&s;y, and effectu|al
remedies for tho&s;e evils and defects that are the continual
&s;ubject of complaint, have been, hitherto, neglected by the
very people who would reap the immediate advantage of
the propo&s;ed alterations; and Mr. <HI>Cleland,</HI> who mu&s;t have
been at a con&s;iderable expence of money, time, and appli|cation,
in bringing his &s;chemes and machinery to per|fection,
will, in all likelihood, &s;ee his de&s;igns for the pub|lic
good &s;till defeated by the &s;ame mean, &s;elfi&s;h, and ma|licious
arts, which have thwarted him &s;o long; unle&s;s they
are overbalanced by the interpo&s;ition of that authority
which hath power to examine and remove every thing
that appears an ob&s;truction to a national advantage.</P>
<P>Narrow minds will ever have narrow views. The cor|poration
of <HI>Bath</HI> &s;eems to have forgot that the ea&s;e and
plenty they now enjoy, and to which their fathers were
&s;trangers, are owing to their Waters; and that an im|provement
upon their Baths, would, by bringing a greater
concour&s;e of company to their town, perpetuate the&s;e
ble&s;&s;ings to them and their po&s;terity. How little is to be
<PB N="39" REF="41">
expected from them, in this particular, might have been
gue&s;&s;ed by their conduct to Mr. <HI>Wood,</HI> the architect, to
who&s;e extraordinary genius they are indebted for a great
part of the trade and beauty of the place: yet they have
indu&s;triou&s;ly oppo&s;ed his be&s;t de&s;igns, which, had they
been executed, would have rendered <HI>Bath,</HI> in point of e|legant
architecture, the admiration of the whole World.
It is, therefore, to be hoped, there are &s;till &s;ome among
us, who&s;e exalted &s;tation, &s;uperior &s;en&s;e, and public &s;pirit,
will be &s;ufficient to intere&s;t the legi&s;lature in an affair
which is truly national, that the public may no longer &s;uf|fer
from the private claims, &s;ordid pa&s;&s;ions, or &s;elfi&s;h
views of any particular &s;et of men. Tho&s;e &s;alutary Springs
are the gift of heaven, of &s;uch con&s;equence to the health
of individuals, as to claim the particular protection of the
public; and <HI>Bath,</HI> under proper au&s;pices, would &s;oon ri|val
the <HI>Baiae</HI> of the ancients; for it might ea&s;ily be brought
to excell as much in beauty and convenience, as in the
&s;alubrious efficacy of its Waters. In an age like this,
when &s;uch &s;ums are expended by private per&s;ons, upon
works of magnificence and decoration; when &s;uch con|&s;iderable
aids are granted for the utility and encourage|ment
of commerce; and our admini&s;tration &s;eems &s;o well
di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ult, and promote, the wellfare of the
commonwealth; we have rea&s;on to believe, that &s;ome at|tention
will be paid to tho&s;e fountains flowing with health,
which, at a very moderate expence, might be &s;o improved
as to become the greate&s;t boa&s;t, ornament, and ble&s;&s;ing of
the&s;e kingdoms.&mdash;But, if our expectations from the le|gi&s;lature
<PB N="40" REF="42">
&s;hould be di&s;appointed, and the Corporation o$
<HI>Bath</HI> &s;till turn a deaf ear to the propo&s;als which have been
made; the proprietors of other Baths, either in this, or in
any other country, will probably take the hints which they
have rejected, and then they may chance to &s;ee their
Springs de&s;erted, and their town utterly impoveri&s;hed and
ruined. This is far from being a vain apprehen&s;ion; in
as much as &s;ome ingenious phy&s;icians from <HI>Portugal</HI> have
obtained models of Mr <HI>Cleland</HI>'s apparatus, and copies of
his plan, with a view to carry it into execution at the <HI>Cal|das</HI>
near <HI>Lisbon;</HI> and I make no doubt that the people of
<HI>Aix la Chapelle,</HI> and the proprietors of the famous Hot
Wells in <HI>Bohemia,</HI> and other parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> will &s;eize
the fir&s;t opportunity of improving tho&s;e Waters, from
which they derive &s;uch advantage, in the concour&s;e of
&s;trangers which they draw together.</P>
<P>Indeed, Mr. <HI>Cleland</HI> &s;eems to have waved all con&s;ide|rations
of private emolument, in con&s;enting that his own
name &s;hould not appear in the plan, but that it &s;hould be
offered as the joint opinion of all the phy&s;icians and &s;ur|geons
of <HI>Bath:</HI> but, in all probability, they are determin|ed
to reject every thing that is known to come from his
quarter, how much &s;oever it may tend to their own ho|nour,
or the good of their fellow-creatures; for I am in|formed
by a particular friend who lately came from that
place, that &s;ince his la&s;t &s;cheme was pre&s;ented, the phy&s;i|cians
have come to a re&s;olution to exclude all &s;urgeons
from their con&s;ultations on this &s;ubject. This mu&s;t be an
<PB N="43" REF="43">
arrow directly levelled at him, (as it does not appear that
any other of his profe&s;&s;ion has propo&s;ed any thing worthy of
public notice) and ju&s;tifies the old ob&s;ervation, that an in|jured
per&s;on will never be forgiven by tho&s;e who have done
him wrong. Nay, &s;o indu&s;trious are his adver&s;aries in the
pro&s;ecution of their enmity, that all methods, even the
lowe&s;t arts, are practi&s;ed to prepo&s;&s;e&s;s the minds of &s;tran|gers
again&s;t him, by a mo&s;t malicious mi&s;repre&s;entation of
his character; though, to tho&s;e who will give them&s;elves
the trouble of inquiring into the truth of facts, he will (I
am confident) appear to be a man of good morals, and
uncommon ability.</P>

<HEAD>REGULATIONS propo&s;ed to the Mayor and
Corporation of BATH.</HEAD>
<P>I. THAT the king and queen's Bath be u&s;ed
three days a week for ladies, and three days for
men, alternately.</P>
<P>II. That the Cro&s;s, and Hot Bath, be u&s;ed three days
for ladies, and three days for men, alternately, differing
from tho&s;e in the king and queen's Bath.</P>
<P>III. That no holidays be allowed as to bathing, except
<HI>Sundays.</HI></P>
<P>IV. That all female guides &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t in either Baths,
tho&s;e days on which the ladies bathe; and the men guides
do the &s;ame, tho&s;e days on which the men bathe.</P>
<P>V. That a table of fees be e&s;tabli&s;hed by the Mayor
and Corporation, to direct &s;trangers in paying the &s;erjeants,
guides, clothwomen, pumpers, &amp;c.</P>
<P>VI. That no &s;erjeant, guide, clothwoman, pumper,
&amp;c. &s;hall pre&s;ume to take, or demand, from any &s;tranger,
or other per&s;ons, more than is &s;pecified in the &s;aid table
of fees, under &s;uch penalty as the Mayor &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="45">
VII. That a convenient number of clo&s;e chairs be
appointed to attend every morning at the Baths, that all
&s;trangers may know where to &s;end for them; and that the
chairmen, &s;o attending, be under the direction of the &s;er|jeants;
the next chair to &s;ucceed, as at the Rooms, which
will prevent many complaints, and remedy a real grievance.</P>
<P>VIII. As it has been cu&s;tomary for &s;trangers and
others, to give gratuities, over and above their &s;tated fees,
to the &s;erjeants, guides, clothwomen, pumpers, &amp;c. let it
be ordered for the future, that all moneys be paid into a
proper per&s;on's hands, at the appointment of the Mayor,
or to the ma&s;ter of the pump-room for the time being;
and that a regi&s;ter be kept of all &s;uch per&s;ons names, and
&s;ums of money, paid to the &s;aid per&s;on &s;o appointed; and
twice a year, or at the end of each &s;ea&s;on, this money &s;hall
be divided in &s;uch proportion, to all the &s;erjeants, guides,
men and women, clothwomen, and pumpers, &amp;c. as the
Mayor &s;hall direct.</P>
<P>IX. It is propo&s;ed to have two chairs, con&s;tantly to
attend at the Mayor's door, or where he &s;hall plea&s;e to ap|point
them, every night, from twelve o'clock 'till day-|light,
for the conveniency of all &s;trangers, phy&s;icians, &s;ur|geons,
men-midwives, apothecaries, and others; that the
chairmen &s;hall take their turns, and in con&s;ideration of
their attendance, all per&s;ons u&s;ing the&s;e chairs, &s;hall pay
double fare from and after twelve o'clock, till day-light,
or what the Mayor &s;hall direct.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="46">
X. Whereas, frequently, and almo&s;t daily, com|plaints
have been made by many indi&s;po&s;ed people, who
are obliged to keep their beds, and are deprived of re&s;t by
the continual noi&s;e of ringing and tolling of bells, it is to
be hoped, when this is repre&s;ented to the Mayor and Cor|poration,
that they, together with the Rector of <HI>Bath,</HI> will
think of &s;ome &s;horter method to give the proper notices,
that the weak, and &s;ick in bed, may not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>XI. As no Bath Water is to be had after eleven
at night, the Pumps being all locked up at that hour, it is
propo&s;ed, that for the future, the common Pump near the
king's Bath, and that belonging to the Hot Bath, &s;hall be
left open till one o'clock in the morning, for the conveni|ency
of all &s;trangers, and others, who are ordered to drink,
and bathe, before they go to bed; that the cocks of the
different Pumps &s;hall be &s;et &s;o high, as that a pail may be
filled under each; and that a direction &s;hall be &s;tuck up
in the pump-room, giving notice where the pumper may
be found, for the benefit of tho&s;e who want Water in the
night.</P>

<HEAD>The following PROPOSALS were pre&s;ented by Mr. Cleland,
at a Meeting of the Phy&s;icians and Surgeons, a&s;&s;embled,
to con&s;ider of the improvements nece&s;&s;ary to be made in
the Hot Baths.</HEAD>
<P>WE, the phy&s;icians, and &s;urgeons, of <HI>Bath,</HI> beg leave to repre|&s;ent
to the Mayor and Corporation, that great advantages will
$word$ to the public, and to the city of <HI>Bath</HI> in particular, by having
$word$ and queen's Bath altered, and made more convenient, and a
$word$ erected, with &s;undry more improvements for the good of all
$word$ &s;hall come here for the benefit of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters.</P>
<P>$word$, it is propo&s;ed to have a hou&s;e fitted up as near the king's Bath
$word$, for all topical applications, and other conveniencies; the
$word$ rooms of which are to con&s;i&s;t of a well-formed Hot Room in the
$word$, to be always kept in order with proper fires, &amp;c. al&s;o with a
$word$ from the re&s;ervoir in the king's Bath, to &s;upply it, at all times,
$word$ Hot Water, where any per&s;ons that require it may be cupp'd, and
$word$; on each &s;ide of this Hot Room, to have a bathing room;
$word$ for gentlemen, and the other for ladies, to communicate with
$word$ into the Hot Room. In each of the&s;e bathing rooms mu&s;t be
$word$ three ci&s;terns, with curtains round each; one of the&s;e ci&s;terns
$word$ the in, either &s;itting, or &s;tanding; the other two for bathing, $word$
or half lying. In each of the&s;e ci&s;terns mu&s;t be placed three
$word$ one from the re&s;ervoir in the king's Bath, to &s;upply the &s;ame
$word$ Hot Water to bathe in, as al&s;o to pump upon any part affected:
$word$ pumps to be work'd on the out&s;ide of the bathing rooms. The
$word$ cock &s;erves to convey the &s;team, or vapour, of the Bath Waters
$word$ a vapour Bath confined in a boiler, to be &s;upplied from the $word$
by means of a Pump, which mu&s;t deliver only into this boiler,
$word$ which there is no outlets, but through the tubes, with valves, or
$word$-cocks, to regulate the natural or artificial heat of the Waters and
$word$ conveyed by them into the&s;e ci&s;terns. The third cock into
$word$ ci&s;terns, is from a Cold Bath kept always ready for tho&s;e that are
$word$ Cold Bathing, in a ci&s;tern made for that purpo&s;e, and will &s;erve
$word$ to lower the natural and artificial heat of the Waters immediate$$
when wanted. To each of the&s;e private ci&s;terns, or Baths, there
$word$ be bed-rooms, and antichambers, with fire-places, for the ac|$$modation
of tho&s;e who &s;weat, bathe, and u&s;e the vapour Bath, cup,
<PB N="48" REF="48">
or bleed, that the patients may &s;tay to repo&s;e them&s;elves, and
until it &s;hall be proper for them to be carried to their lodgings&punc;</P>
<P>The alterations propo&s;ed to be made in the king and queen
are the&s;e:</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, to &s;top up the nitches, and take away the rails; the$
wall of the king's Bath &s;hould be rai&s;ed &s;o high, as to &s;creen $word$
in the Bath, from tho&s;e without it; that the ea&s;t, we&s;t, $word$
walls &s;hould be rebuilt in the &s;ame form; that a portico &s;hould $|&s;cribed
round this ci&s;tern, for &s;helter to the Bathers; that the $word$
Bath &s;hould be removed &s;o far to the ea&s;tward, as to an&s;wer $word$
middle of the king's Bath; that four &s;lips &s;hould be made in$$
ci&s;tern, with dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, and antichambers to them; $word$
pumps &s;hould be fixt in the dre&s;&s;ing-rooms, for the u&s;e of $word$
&s;hould be pump'd without going into the Bath; that four $word$
pumps &s;hould be fixt in the king's$ Bath, out of the draught of $word$
of wind that could happen from the buildings, for the u&s;e of $word$
&s;hould be pump'd in the Bath; and that a paved walk &s;hould be $word$
round both Baths, upon one level, for the benefit of poor crippl$
make u&s;e of the Waters.</P>
<P>It is hoped, that, when this alteration is undertaken, the &s;am$
will be thought nece&s;&s;ary for amending the &s;lips into the king's
as is propo&s;ed in the queen's.</P>
<P>The&s;e la&s;t alterations, which, together with the &s;udatory, and$
apparatus, will make the Baths compleatly u&s;eful; or, if it &s;hould$
pen that all the&s;e Pumps &s;hould be made u&s;e of at the &s;ame tim$
cording to this plan, there will be, notwith&s;tanding what is ma$
of at the pump-room, &amp;c. &s;till a &s;ufficient quantity of Water to a$
all the&s;e good purpo&s;es be&s;ides; &s;eeing the king's Bath contain$
tuns, and 50 gallons, and fills in 9 hours and 40 minutes.</P>
<P>As to the alterations required to be made in the cro&s;s and hot$
they are but &s;mall, though a regulation in Bathing is much wa$
with re&s;pect to the &s;erjeants, guides, chairmen, and clothwom$$
con&s;ideration of which is humbly &s;ubmitted to the Mayor and $word$,
and a method for that purpo&s;e &s;hall be made appear to $word$
at their de&s;ire.</P>
<P>The expence of the&s;e la&s;t alterations, Mr. <HI>Wood</HI> computed a
thou&s;and pounds, and they, together with the Bagnio, and all its$
ratus, will render the u&s;e of the Baths much more &s;afe and eff$
than it is at pre&s;ent, until the other more magnificent &s;cheme o$
ingenious archi$ect &s;hall be carried into execution.</P>
