<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mrs. Cowley's comedy of <HI>The Belle's Stratagem</HI> was fir&s;t announced, it occurred to the author of the following drama, that it might be a parody on Farquhar's excellent comedy of <HI>The Beaux Stratagem;</HI> under that idea he went to &s;ee it performed: but, in&s;tead of a faint copy, found a vivid original.</P>
<P>The &s;ugge&s;tion of a parody on Farquhar had, however, &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed his imagination, that he was compelled to yield to it by producing this; which, having been favourably received nearly twenty nights on the &s;tage, now ventures forth dive&s;ted of the charms of action. The Reader will, it is pre&s;umed and hoped, in idea &s;upply them; or, it mu&s;t remain a mere dead letter: &s;eeing, with his "mind's eye," the vola|tile plea&s;antry of Mr. Banni&s;ter, Jun. or, agree|able freedom of Mr. Fawcett, in <HI>Frank Millclack;</HI> the genteel ru&s;ticity of Mr. Barrymore, in 'Squire <HI>Edward;</HI> the &s;kilful junction of bluntne&s;s and pa|thos by Mr. Aickin, in General <HI>Fairlove;</HI> the ab|&s;olute per&s;onification of avarice and cupidity by Mr. Suett, in old <HI>Rackrent;</HI> the becoming mo|de&s;ty of Mr. Ben&s;on, in <HI>the player;</HI> the natural humour of Mr. Wewitzer, and irre&s;i&s;tible <HI>vis co|mica</HI> of Mr. Par&s;ons, in the clown <HI>Timothy.</HI></P>
<P>To complete this mental vi&s;ion mu&s;t be added, the fa&s;cinating vivacity of Mrs. Gibbs, in <HI>Maria;</HI> the unaffected &s;en&s;ibility of Mrs. Powell, and in|tere&s;ting
<PB N="iv" REF="3">&s;implicity of Mrs. Kemble, in <HI>Charlotte;</HI> the ince&s;&s;ant loquacity of Mrs. Hopkins, in Mrs. <HI>Millclack;</HI> and the unique, mo&s;t perfect a&s;&s;ump|tion of character, in dre&s;s, dialect, and demeanour, exhibited by Mrs. Harlowe, in the country maw|kin <HI>Dorothy:</HI> all of whom, not forgetting tho&s;e unmentioned, are ju&s;tly entitled to, and are here reque&s;ted to receive, the author's warme&s;t thanks for their &s;everal exertions to &s;erve him.</P>
<P>The favour of the Manager's highly-humorous Epilogue, as humorou&s;ly delivered by Mr. Ban|ni&s;ter, Jun. merits, and receives particular ac|knowledgment. Mr. Barrymore's lively recita|tion of the Prologue proved him de&s;erving of a better one.</P>
<P>Should any hyper-critic a&s;&s;ail the author for his divi&s;ion of the play into four acts, Dr. Blair's <HI>Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres</HI> mu&s;t be his &s;hield. "The divi&s;ion of every play, into five acts, has no other foundation than common practice, and the authority of Horace.
<Q><L>Neve minor, neu &s;it quanto productior actu</L>
<L>Fabula.&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>DE ARTE POET.</BIBL></Q></P>
<P>It is a divi&s;ion purely arbitrary. There is no|thing in the nature of the compo&s;ition which fixes this number rather than any other; and it had been much better if no &s;uch number had been a&s;certain|ed, but every play had been allowed to divide it|&s;elf into as many parts, or intervals, as the &s;ub|ject naturally pointed out."</P>

<LG>
<L>HEIGHO FOR A HUSBAND! the title's not bad&mdash;</L>

<L>That remains to be proved&mdash;meantime let's de&s;cant&mdash;</L>
<L>Tho' a &s;aying &s;o trite no explaining can want.&mdash;</L>

<L>Or, at home with Mama, reading Novels &s;o charming,</L>

<L>E'en Mama, as Mi&s;s reads, can't &s;uppre&s;s the &s;weet &s;igh;</L>
<L>And, were Spou&s;y but dead, would again Heigho! cry.</L>
<L>When mature, the young Lady, if nothing wor&s;e chances,</L>
<L>Proclaims Heigho! aloud; and to Gretna Green prances:</L>
<L>The prudi&s;h coy Females who thirty attain,</L>
<L>Cry Heigho for a Hu&s;band! at length, but in vain;</L>
<L>For the Men &s;ay, no, no! and, the down off the peach,</L>
<L>Reject what before they &s;tood tiptoe to reach.</L>
<L>The Widow of Sixty, her &s;eventh mate dead,</L>
<L>Cries Heigho! for an Eighth, with one tooth in her head;</L>

<L>A colt's tooth &s;ome call it, but I am afraid</L>

<L>With four pearls on her coronet in her own right,</L>
<L>The Barone&s;s &s;ighs for five pearls day and night;</L>
<L>O, were &s;he a Counte&s;s, how happy her &s;tate:</L>
<L>She marries an Earl, and is wretchedly great!</L>
<L>Should an eye to the pocket pollute our &s;oft &s;cenes,</L>
<L>The Author from nature to paint only means:</L>
<L>From nature alone? No! he owns, and with pride,</L>
<L>That Nature and Farquhar him equally guide!</L>
<L>If, therefore, you track him in &s;omething well known,</L>

<P>Hold your tongue, I &s;ay!&mdash;I have al&s;o heard of your being the champion of this para|mount-puppet! as a puni&s;hment for which, I here declare, and I de&s;ire all parties pre&s;ent to take notice of it, that I di&s;inherit you! I'll cut you off with a &s;hilling, &s;irrah! and, that I may be &s;ure you will have no more, I'll &s;ell my e&s;tates; and, when I die, be buried ten fathom under ground, and have all my money buried along with me!</P>

<P>There, Madam! you hear the determi|nation of your protector's father:&mdash;now, will you prefer love and poverty with him, or ea&s;e and affluence with me?</P>

<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I cannot conceive on what pre|tence you ground your in&s;olence; and, as no one

<P>By my &s;word, honour, and affection! I believe I have been &s;o eager to recover my dear child, that I have not had thought enough to tell her, what I am certain &s;he could not know un|told; and, in&s;tead of flying to the arms of her fond, anxious father, perhaps &s;he has mi&s;taken me for a trouble&s;ome, ridiculous, old lover.</P>

<P>I no &s;ooner arrived in London, than I was told, that you had read in the public prints, an account of the &s;hip I came home in being lo&s;t; and, being al&s;o inform'd of your abrupt depar|ture, having traced you to the inn you &s;et out from, I in&s;tantly pur&s;ued, and have, here, hap|pily regain'd my darling child, my Charlotte!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Sir! this is not a place wherein I can properly expre&s;s my filial feelings! but, for|give me, I be&s;eech you, Sir, that &s;o many years ab&s;ence, with the belief that you were dead, &s;hould have made me not recognize my ever|honour'd parent!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHAR.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your goodne&s;s, Sir, emboldens me to beg, that, however you may have rea&s;on to chide me for my late precipitate flight; as it has been productive of an unhappy breach between this young gentleman and his father, you will gra|ciou&s;ly con&s;ider him as the innocent victim of love and accident.</P>
