<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. S&mdash;R,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Enclo&s;ed Memorial you are Charg'd with, in the behalf of many Thou&s;ands of the good People of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There is neither <HI>Popi&s;h, Jacobite, Seditious, Court,</HI> or <HI>Party Intere&s;t</HI> concern'd in it; but Hone&s;ty and Truth.</P>
<P>You are Commanded by Two Hundred Thou&s;and <HI>Engli&s;h|men,</HI> to Deliver it to the H&mdash;e of C&mdash;s, and to in|form them that it is no Banter, but Serious Truth; and a Serious regard to it is Expected; nothing but Ju&s;tice, and their Duty is requir'd, and it is requir'd by them who have both a Right to Require, and Power to Compell. <HI>viz.</HI> the People of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>We could have come to the Hou&s;e Strong enough to Oblige them to hear us, but we have avoided any Tumults, not de&s;iring to Embroil, but to Save our Native Country.</P>
<P>If you refu&s;e to Communicate it to them, you will find cau&s;e in a &s;hort time to Repent it.</P>
<P>To <HI>R&mdash;t H&mdash;y</HI> E&s;q; S&mdash;$ to the H&mdash;e of C&mdash;s,</P>
<P>The&s;e.</P>

<P>A Memorial,</P>
<P>From the Gentlemen, Free-holders and Inhabitants of the Counties of&mdash;in the behalf of them&s;elves, and

<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd you were Men of that Temper, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;o much Honour, as to bear with the Truth, tho it be again&s;t you: E&s;pecially from us who have &s;o much Right to tell it you; but &s;ince, Even Pe|titions to you from your Ma&s;ters, (for &s;uch are the Peo|ple who Cho&s;e you) are &s;o Haughtily receiv'd, as with the Committing the Authors to Illegal Cu&s;tody; you mu&s;t give us leave to give you this fair Notice of your Mi&s; behaviour, without Expo&s;ing our Names.</P>
<P>If you think fit to rectifie your Errors, you will do well, and po&s;&s;ibly may hear no more of us; but if not, a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves the Nation will not long hide their Re&s;entments. And tho there are no &s;tated Proceedings to bring you to your Duty, yet the great Law of Rea|&s;on &s;ays, and all Nations allow, that what ever Power is above Law, is Burthen&s;om, and Tyrannical; and may be reduc'd by <HI>Extrajudicial</HI> Methods: You are not above the Peoples Re&s;entments, they that made you Mem|bers, may reduce you to the &s;ame rank from whence they cho&s;e you; and may give you a Ta&s;te of their abu&s;ed kindne&s;s, in Terms you may not be pleas'd with.</P>
<P>When the People of <HI>England</HI> A&s;&s;embl'd in Conven|tion, Pre&s;ented the Crown to his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, they annexed a Declaration of the Rights of the People, in which was Expre&s;s'd what was Illegal and Arbitrary in the former Reign, and what was claim'd as of Right to be done by Succeeding Kings of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, here follows, Gentlemen, a &s;hort abridgment of the Nations Grievances, and of your Il|legal, and Unwarrantable Practices; and a Claim of Right which we make in the Name of our Selves, and &s;uch of the good People of <HI>England,</HI> as are ju&s;tly Al|larum'd at your Proceedings.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="3">
I. To Rai&s;e Funds for Money, and Declare by bor|rowing Clau&s;es, that who&s;oever Advances Money on tho&s;e Funds, &s;hall be Re imburs'd out of the next Aids, if the Funds fall &s;hort; and then give Sub&s;equent Funds, without Transferring the Deficiency of the former, is a horrible Cheat on the Subject who lent the Money; a Breach of Publique Faith, and de&s;tructive to the Ho|nour and Credit of Parliaments.</P>
<P N="2">II. To Impri&s;on Men who are not your own Members, by no proceedings but a Vote of your Hou&s;e, and to continue them in Cu&s;tody <HI>Sine Die</HI> is Illegal; a Noto|rious Breach of the Liberty of the People; Setting up a Di&s;pen&s;ing Power in the Hou&s;e of Commons, which your Fathers never pretended to; bidding defiance to the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which is the Bulwark of Per|&s;onal Liberty, De&s;tructive of the Laws, and Betraying the Tru&s;t repos'd in you. <HI>The King at the &s;ame time being obliged to ask you Leave to continue in Cu&s;tody the Horrid A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inators of His Per&s;on.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Committing to Cu&s;tody tho&s;e Gentlemen, who at the Command of the People (who&s;e Servants you are) and in a Peaceable way put you in mind of your Duty, is Illegal and Injurious; De&s;tructive of the Sub|jects Liberty of Petitioning for Redre&s;s of Grievances, which has by all Parliaments before you, been acknow|ledged to be their undoubted Right.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Voting a Petition from the Gentlemen of <HI>Kent</HI> In&s;olent; is Ridiculous and Impertinent, becau&s;e the Free-holders of <HI>England</HI> are your Superiours; and is a contradiction in it Self, and a Contempt of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Freedom, and contrary to the Nature of Parliamentary Power.</P>
<P N="5">V. Voting People Guilty of Bribery and Ill Practices, and Committing them as afore&s;aid, without Bail, and then upon &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and kneeling to your Hou&s;e, di&s;|charging
<PB N="4" REF="4">
them; Exacting Exorbitant Fees by your Officers, is Illegal, Betraying the Ju&s;tice of the Nation, Selling the Liberty of the Subject, encouraging the Ex|tortion and Villany of Gaolers and Officers; and di&s;con|tinuing the Legal Pro&s;ecutions of Offenders, in the or|dinary Cour&s;e of Law.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Pro&s;ecuting the Crime of Bribery in &s;ome to &s;erve a Party, and then proceed no further, tho proof lay before you, is Partial and Unju&s;t; and a Scandal upon the Honour of Parliaments.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Voting the Treaty of Partition Fatal to <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e it gave &s;o much of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Dominions to the <HI>French,</HI> and not concern your &s;elves to prevent their taking Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it all. De&s;erting the <HI>Dutch</HI> when the <HI>French</HI> are at their Doors, till it be almo&s;t too late to help them; is Uuju&s;t to our Treaties, and unkind to our Confederates; Di&s;honourable to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion, and &s;hews you very negligent of the Safety of <HI>England,</HI> and of our Prote&s;tant Neighbours.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Ordering immediate hearings to trifling Pe|titions, to plea&s;e parties in Elections; and <HI>Po&s;tpone</HI> the Petition of a Widow for the Blood of her Murthered Daughter, without giving it a reading; is an Illegal delay of Ju&s;tice, di&s;honourable to the Publique Ju&s;tice of the Nation.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Addre&s;&s;ing the King to di&s;place His Friends up|on bare Surmi&s;es, before any Legal Tryal or Article prov'd; is Illegal, an Inverting the Law, and making Execution go before Judgment; contrary to the true &s;ence of the Law, which e&s;teems every Man a good Man till &s;omething appears to the contrary.</P>
<P N="10">X. Delaying proceedings upon Capital Impeach|ments, to bla&s;t the reputation of the Per&s;ons, without proving the Fact; is Illegal and Oppre&s;&s;ive, de&s;tructive
<PB N="5" REF="5">
of the Liberty of <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> a delay of Ju&s;tice, and a reproach to Parliaments.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Suffering Sawcy and inde cent Reproaches upon His Maje&s;ties Per&s;on, to be publiquely made in your Hou&s;e; particularly by that Impudent Scandal of Par|liaments <HI>J&mdash;n H&mdash;w,</HI> without &s;hewing &s;uch re&s;ent|ments as you ought to do. The &s;aid <HI>H&mdash;w</HI> &s;aying openly, <Q>&startq;&endq;That His Maje&s;ty had made a Felonious Treaty to rob his Neighbours; in&s;inuating that the Partition Treaty (which was every way as ju&s;t as blow|ing up one Mans Hou&s;e to &s;ave another) was a Combi|nation of the King to rob the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> of its due;</Q> this is making a <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> of the Hou&s;e, and &s;etting up to <HI>Bully</HI> your Soveraign, contrary to the intent and mea|ning of that freedom of Speech which you claim as a a Right; is &s;candalous to Parliaments; Undutiful and Unmannerly, and a Reproach to the whole Nation.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Your S&mdash;r Exacting the Exorbitant rate of 10 <HI>l. per Diem</HI> for the V&mdash;s, and giving the Printer in|couragement to rai&s;e it on the People, by &s;elling them at 4 <HI>d. per</HI> Sheet; is an Illegal, and Arbitrary exaction, di&s;honourable to the Hou&s;e, and burthen&s;ome to the People.</P>
<P N="13"><HI>XIII.</HI> Neglecting &s;till to pay the Nations Debts, Com|pounding for Intere&s;t, and <HI>Po&s;tponing</HI> Petitions; is Illegal, Di&s;honourable, and de&s;tructive of the Publique Faith.</P>
<P N="14"><HI>XIV.</HI> Publiquely neglecting the great work of Re|formation of Manners; though often pre&s;s'd to it by the King; to the great di&s;honour of God, and encourage|ment of Vice, is a neglect of your Duty, and an abu&s;e of the Tru&s;t repos'd in you, by God, His Maje&s;ty and the People.</P>
<P N="15"><HI>XV.</HI> Being Scandalou&s;ly Vitious your &s;elves, both in your Morals and Religion; Lewd in Life, and Er|roneous in Doctrine, having publique Bla&s;phemers and
<PB N="6" REF="6">
Impudent denyers of the Divinity of our Saviour a|mong you, and &s;uffering them unreproved and unpu|ni&s;hed, to the infinite regret of all good Chri&s;tians, and the Ju&s;t abhorrence of the whole Nation.</P>
<P>Wherefore, in the &s;ad pro&s;pect of the impending ruine of our Native Countrey, while Parliaments (which ought to be the Security and Defence of our Laws and Con&s;titution) betray their Tru&s;t, and abu&s;e the People whom they &s;hould protect, and no other way being left us but <HI>That</HI> Force which we are very loath to make u&s;e of, that Po&s;terity may know we did not in&s;en&s;ibly fall under the Tyranny of a prevailing Party, We do hereby</P>
<P>Claim and declare,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is the undoubted Right of the People of <HI>England,</HI> in ca&s;e their Repre&s;entatives in Parliament do not proceed according to their Duty and the Peoples Intere&s;t, to inform them of their Di&s;like, di&s;own their Actions, and to direct them to &s;uch things as they think fit, either by Petition, Addre&s;s, Propo&s;al, Me|morial, or any other peaceable way.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;eparately and otherwi&s;e than by Bill Legally pa&s;s'd into an Act, have no Legal power to &s;u&s;pend or di&s;pen&s;e with the Laws of the Land, any more than the King has by his Pre|rogative.</P>
<P N="3">3. That the Hou&s;e of Commons have no legal Pow|er to impri&s;on any per&s;on, or commit them to cu&s;tody of Serjeants or otherwi&s;e, (their own Members ex|cepted) but ought to addre&s;s the King, to cau&s;e any per&s;on on good Grounds to be apprehended, which per&s;on &s;o apprehended, ought to have the Benefit of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, and be fairly brought to Tryal by due Cour&s;e of Law.</P>
<P N="4">4. That if the Hou&s;e of Commons, in breach of the
<PB N="7" REF="7">
Laws and Liberties of the People do betray the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, and act Negligently or Arbitrarily, and Illegally, it is the undoubted Right of the People of <HI>England</HI> to call them to an account for the &s;ame, and by Convention, A&s;&s;embly or Force may proceed again&s;t them as Traytors, and Betrayers of their Coun|trey.</P>
<P>The&s;e things we think proper to declare, as the un|que&s;tioned Right of the People of <HI>England,</HI> whom you &s;erve, and in pur&s;uance of that Right (avoiding the Ceremony of Petitioning our Inferiours, for &s;uch you are by your pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, as the per&s;on <HI>&s;ent</HI> is Le&s;s than the <HI>Sender)</HI> We do publickly prote&s;t again&s;t all your fore&s;aid Illegal Actions, and in the Name of our &s;elves, and of all the good People of <HI>England,</HI> do</P>
<P>Require <HI>and</HI> Demand</P>
<P N="1">1. That all the publique Ju&s;t Debts of the Nation be forthwith payd and di&s;charged.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all per&s;ons illegally impri&s;oned as afore&s;aid, be either immediately di&s;charged, or admitted to Bail, as by Law they ought to be; and the Liberty of the Subject Recogniz'd and re&s;tor'd.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>J&mdash;n H&mdash;w</HI> afore&s;aid be obliged to ask His Maje&s;ties Pardon for his Vile reflections, or be immedi|ately expell'd the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the growing Power of <HI>France</HI> be taken into con&s;ideration; the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Emperour to the Crown of <HI>Spain</HI> &s;upported; our Prote&s;tant Neigh|bours protected, as the true Intere&s;t of <HI>England,</HI> and the Prote&s;tant Religion requires.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the <HI>French</HI> King be obliged to quit <HI>Flanders,</HI> or that His Maje&s;ty be addre&s;s'd to declare War again&s;t him.</P>
<P N="6">6. That Suitable Supplyes be granted to His Ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="8" REF="8">
for the putting all the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary things in execu|tion, and that care be taken that &s;uch Taxes as are rai&s;ed, may be more equally A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and Collected, and &s;candalous Deficiencies prevented.</P>
<P N="7">7. That the thanks of the Hou&s;e may be given to tho&s;e Gentlemen who &s;o gallantly appear'd in the be|half of their Country, with the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Petition, and have been &s;o &s;candalou&s;ly u&s;ed for it.</P>
<P>Thus Gentlemen you have your duty laid before you, which 'tis hoped you will think of; but if you continue to neglect it, you may expect to be treated according to the re&s;entments of an injur'd Nation; for <HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI> are no more to be Slaves to Parliaments, than to a King.</P>
