<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THis is but the &s;econd Time that the Author hereof hath undertaken to appear in this publick Manner, although he has for many Years been known to have &s;trangely fortold &s;everal Things, which have preci&s;ely come to pa&s;s: As in particular; At the Peace of <HI>Re&s;wick,</HI> he foretold, that in a &s;hort time the War would break forth a|gain: He foretold the great Storm, and &s;everal other Things; and having the &s;econd Sight, he has &s;aid many Strange and Wonderful Things in a Manner &s;o unaccounta|ble, that none have come near him in this Age.</P>
<P>He was per&s;waded the la&s;t Year to give Leave to a Friend to Publi&s;h his Prophetick Ob&s;ervations, who did it with an inexcu&s;able Weakne&s;s, turning much of it into Je&s;t and Ridicule, and &s;etting the Imaginary and Thread|bare Name of <HI>I&s;aac Bicker&s;taff</HI> to it: This made the more &s;erious Part of it &s;u&s;pected by Wi&s;er, People, and made the Whole look more like &s;omething Prophane and Ro|mantick than a Prediction of Wonderful Judgments to befal the World.</P>
<P>The Author therefore ju&s;tly di&s;liking that Method, recom|mends his Predictions to you this Year, from his own Hand, in a more grave and &s;olemn Manner.</P>
<P>Before he goes on to the Particulars of a Year, equal for Wender with any that have gone before, he be&s;peaks his Reader to look back upon his la&s;t Year, and ob&s;erve how much of what he &s;aid there, came exactly to pa&s;s, book &s;uitable to the Circum&s;tance of Time and Place as well as Per&s;ons.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> He foretold the Death of the late Emperor <HI>Jo&s;eph:</HI> but the partial Publi&s;her having been affraid to make it Publick, for Fear of the Re&s;entment of the Emperor's Mini&s;ters, He forbore to mention it, though the very Time, and part of the Circum&s;tances, appear in the Original Manu&s;cript, which the Author has now by him,</P>
<P><PB REF="3">
<HI>Next,</HI> He foretold the Death of the <HI>Dauphin</HI> of <HI>France</HI> in &s;o many Words, the very Month of his Decea&s;e; h$ Words are the&s;e, <HI>The Dauphine Dyes,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> He exactly Predicted the Death of the <HI>M$+re&s;chal de Bouffleurs.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> He exactly Predicted the Battle between t$ <HI>Turks</HI> and the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> with &s;uch exact Circum&s;tan+ces, that he told you the Pretences both Sides made to the Victory, together with the wa&s;ting away of the King <HI>Sweden's</HI> Forces, without doing any thing con&s;iderable.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> He foretold you the breaking out of the Plag$ in the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Dominions, and e&s;pecially that it &s;hould make great Havock in his Capital City <HI>Copenhagen,</HI> which has been eminently fullfilled, wit$ many other Things, for which he referrs to his la&s;t Year$ Prophecy, and hopes as he has &s;et out this in a more &s;eri+ous Manner, it may meet with your more &s;erious At+tention.</P>

<HEAD>Fir&s;t Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>THE Councils of <HI>Europe</HI> having been long bu&s;ie upon the great Di&s;pute about Peace, begin now to fee not &s;o certain as &s;ome People imagined; and therefore with great Diligence apply them&s;elves to make prepara+tions for War; but this is only that the good po&s;ture of Affairs on both &s;ides my contribute to make the Op+po&s;ite <HI>Party</HI> more willing to hearken to Terms.</P>
<P>Whatever &s;hew of War they make, many other Con+federates incline to obtain a Peace; <HI>France</HI> u&s;es all i$ Intere&s;t to obtain a <HI>Peace,</HI> and will bid fair to fix a Peace if not with all the Allies, yet with &s;ome of them, who are &s;o Con&s;iderable, as that the Le&s;s mu&s;t come in la&s;t; but this is not yet, for &s;ome of the Confederat$ oppo&s;e it with great Steddine&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
The War in <HI>Pomerania</HI> goes on heavily, the <HI>Dane:</HI> bla&s;ted by Heaven, &s;ucceed in nothing they Attempt a|gain&s;t the <HI>Swedes,</HI> the Extremity of the Weather, Want, Sickne&s;s and Service, wa&s;te their Army, and the re&s;t run away &s;o fa&s;t, as will make the Whole unfit for their De&s;igns. The <HI>Swedes</HI> defend them&s;elves, and &s;tand their Ground, and that Undertaking will prove un|&s;ucce&s;sful, as mo&s;t unju&s;t Wars do.</P>
<P>The Affair of the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> at <HI>Bender</HI> will prove yet Intricate; he will make Three Attempts to &s;hake the Re&s;olutions of the Grand Signior, and he almo&s;t per|&s;wades him to Break again with the <HI>Mu&s;covites;</HI> but the Humour Changes at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> and he cannot compleat it yet, he continues there &s;till.</P>
<P>A great Storm this Month may do great damage at Sea, and in the Ports of <HI>Europe;</HI> but it &s;eems the <HI>Dutch</HI> will be the principal Sufferers.</P>
<P>A great Per&s;on in this Nation, and two in <HI>France,</HI> will yield to Fate about this Month.</P>
<P>In <HI>Britain</HI> great Contention about places, preferments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;everal People who have long expected to lo&s;e their places, &s;hall fall, to make Room for another Party to guide the Nation.</P>
<P>No Signs of <HI>Peace</HI> among our &s;elves yet, whatever may happen Abroad.</P>

<HEAD>Second Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>PEace creates War as War produces Peace, and the &s;ame Meetings and Con&s;ultations of Amba&s;&s;adors and Plenipotentiaries have been had, but not being able to ad|$u&s;t Matters, the Preparations for War go on; great $ums of Money, and new invented Ways for the rai&s;ing $$ are now the Subject of the Councils of <HI>Europe.</HI> The Rich rai&s;e Strifes and War, and the Poor pay for it: New $axes are laid by Authority, and the Heads of the Pro|$$ctors are now employed to find out proper Methods for $upplies, that we may be ready for War as well as for $eace.</P>
<P>Great Struggling of <HI>Parties</HI> in <HI>Britain,</HI> in Oppo&s;ition
<PB N="6" REF="5">
to a Treaty of Peace; yet the Nece&s;&s;ity of Affairs &s;eems to make it unavoidable: Tho&s;e that con&s;ent to Treat, do not all con&s;ent to it with a de&s;ign of <HI>Peace;</HI> however, the Re&s;olution of the Treaty &s;eems to prevail, and accor|dingly Amba&s;&s;adors from all Parts are Named, and be|gin their fir&s;t Conference in form, though abundance of Memorials and Remon&s;trances are daily pre&s;ented from Abroad again&s;t it.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> pre&s;s to peace; the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> appear willing; the <HI>Dutch</HI> backward; &s;maller Allies indifferent; the Em+peror ab&s;olutely refu&s;es it.</P>
<P>Twice about <HI>February</HI> things appear ready to clo&s;e, the <HI>Frenth</HI> offer largely; &s;ome Allies a&s;&s;ent, &s;ome crave more, others reject all.</P>
<P>Strange foreboding Signals of the Calamities of <HI>Eu+rope</HI> happen about this time, unu&s;ual Tempe&s;ts, mon&s;trous Births, &s;urprizing Earthquakes, and the like: The Mor+tality of Cattle &s;preads it &s;elf into &s;everal parts of <HI>Eu+rope;</HI> a rare runner of a Mortality of another Kind, which &s;hall Carry off a great many of the Fir&s;t Rank in <HI>Europe</HI> particularly in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="3">
<HEAD>Third Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>GReat News from Sea about this Time to the Advan+tage of our Enemies the <HI>French</HI> in &s;ome part o$ <HI>America.</HI> The Princes of <HI>Europe</HI> are now acting two contrary Extreams; they Treat of a <HI>Peace</HI> as if the re&s;olved to have no more <HI>War;</HI> and they prepare for <HI>W$</HI> as if they had no Thought of <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P>All the proceedings on the Treaties of <HI>Peace</HI> &s;eem end in a &s;eparate Accommodation, and as if every Bran$ were to look to it &s;elf: They begin to Act with $$ Confidence, and le&s;s Satisfaction in one another than fo$ merly: <HI>France</HI> makes its Court here, and blu&s;ters a talks big there, ju&s;t as its Intere&s;t guides: <HI>Britain</HI> a <HI>Holland</HI> hold together &s;till, though great Endeavours many Sides to &s;eparate and di&s;unite them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> u&s;e all the Art and Subtilty, peculiar that Nation, in order to &s;eparate the Confederates, a break them off from one another; nor is it altogether wi$$ out Succe&s;s; &s;ome Nations are in more Need of <HI>Pe$</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="6">
than others: Some carry on the War at le&s;s $Span$ than others; and &s;ome are likely to make better $Span$ <HI>Peace</HI> than others.</P>
<P>The <HI>Emperor</HI> &s;tands ob&s;tinately out again&s;t a <HI>Peace,</HI> and threatens to carry on the <HI>War</HI> alone; complains of being Abandoned by the Allies; and refu&s;es to divide, or part with the lea&s;t Share of the <HI>Spani&s;h Monarchy.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Princes</HI> of the <HI>North,</HI> as more out of danger of the <HI>French,</HI> are backward to a <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Britain</HI> puthes for a <HI>Peace</HI> Abroad, but great Heats and Quarrels about it at Home, where neither the Thing it &s;elf, or the Conditions, reli&s;h with the people &s;o well as <HI>Peace</HI> ought to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Parliament</HI> of <HI>Britain</HI> are now &s;itting; uncom|mon Difficulties attend the rai&s;ing Supplies, and re&s;tle&s;s Spirits pu&s;h at making popular Di&s;tractions: The Friends to new Revolutions in <HI>Britain,</HI> both as to Mini&s;try and Succe&s;&s;ion, though on different Foundations, and with differing Views join in this, to oppo&s;e and embarra&s;s the con&s;tituted Government.</P>
<P>Great Changes are Brewing in the <HI>North</HI> of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Denmark, Poland</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy</HI> prepare as if they re&s;olved to devour the <HI>Swede,</HI> but the latter holds up &s;till again&s;t them all.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="4">
<HEAD>Fourth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P><HI>PEACE</HI> &s;urprizes the World now rather by the va|rious Shapes it appears in, than the Means it is procured by: The Nations &s;eem rather to drive one another to Peace, than approve of it; and tho&s;e that call what they have done, <HI>a making Peace,</HI> rather comply than are plea&s;ed with it.</P>
<P>However, they Treat with more Earne&s;tne&s;s about it now, as being brought to the <HI>Cri&s;is</HI> of Time when they mu&s;t ca&s;t the <HI>Dye</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> or <HI>War.</HI></P>
<P>Something &s;hall happen in the middle of this Tran&s;action that &s;hall put all <HI>Europe</HI> on new Mea&s;ures. A Great Crown falls from a powerful Head about this Time; and <HI>Europe</HI> avoids a third <HI>War</HI> about <HI>Property,</HI> with great Difficulty.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
Strange un&s;ea&s;onable Tempe&s;ts and unwhole&s;ome Va|pours fill the Air; and the darke&s;t Day that was ever|&s;een, will happen about <HI>April,</HI> though by no Eclip&s;e of the Sun at all.</P>
<P>The War in <HI>Pomerania</HI> threatens greatly about this Time, the <HI>Swedes</HI> begin to appear &s;trong; and the Princes of the <HI>Empire,</HI> the States of <HI>Holland</HI> and others, begin to concern them&s;elves to prevent the Con&s;equences of the War: The <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> puff'd up with Succe&s;s, talk big, and threaten the Empire; and the Confederate Princes begin to &s;ee too late the Fruits of A&s;&s;i&s;ting to make that Barbarous Nation great in the World.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> begins to make new Stirs in the <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> and continuing &s;till among the <HI>Turks,</HI> at la&s;t brings the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and the <HI>Turks</HI> to a Quarrel; but no <HI>$$ar</HI> in Hand yet.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> falls in with the <HI>Swedi&s;h</HI> De&s;igns at <HI>Con&s;$$$ti|nople,</HI> but acting the Cunning part, however leaves if in|different, whether to get the <HI>Turks</HI> to break with the <HI>Czar</HI> or with the <HI>Venetians,</HI> as what may either Way embark the <HI>Empire</HI> in the War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Venetians</HI> Arm, and &s;ome little Ho&s;tilities happen at Sea; but no War yet.</P>
<P>About this Time, the <HI>Sea&s;on</HI> returning, the <HI>Plague</HI> be|gins to give new Alarms in <HI>Europe,</HI> and &s;preads it &s;elf in|to <HI>Mecklenberg, Hol&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> being brought thither by the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Armies and Fleets: <HI>Ro&s;tock, $Word$</HI> and <HI>Str$l&s;und</HI> begin to feel the terrible Effects of it: The City of <HI>Hamburgh</HI> e&s;capes yet.</P>
<P>Three great Per&s;ons in the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s Family el&s;e, and perhaps him&s;elf; his Allies not effectually a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, the <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Affairs are reduced very low.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="5">
<HEAD>Fifth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>NOW they begin the Campaigns; &s;ome Fight and &s;ome Treat, and &s;ome both Treat and Fight; and &s;ome who talk as big as any, neither Fight nor Treat: The War goes on Awkwardly and Heavily, as if they $ought with an Iil Will: <HI>French Cunning</HI> prevails in many
<PB N="9" REF="8">
<HI>Courts,</HI> and they have Peace in Effect, when they have War in Appearance: Thus the War now rather Impo|veri&s;hes than De&s;troys, and there is likely to be more Money than Blood lo&s;t this Campaign.</P>
<P>Farther off, the War and the Plague puni&s;hes <HI>Europe</HI> together, the la&s;t having made de&s;olate the mo&s;t Flouri&s;h|ing Countries, &s;preads now into the <HI>Empire,</HI> by &s;low &s;teps coming this Way &s;till, threatens us more and more. <HI>Hamburgh</HI> feels this terrible Enemy a little before the hot Weather comes in, but more afterwards: <HI>Pomerania</HI> is now mi&s;erably afflicted with War, Pe&s;tilence and Fa|mine; no Pen can de&s;cribe the Di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Inhabi|tants of that Country.</P>
<P>The New Emperor begins to threaten <HI>Europe</HI> with a Mighty Army, and talks Great Things: <HI>France</HI> gets Ground by crafty and &s;ubtil Councils, rather than the Sword; yet an Action happens in <HI>Catalonia,</HI> to the Di&s;advantage of the Imperiali&s;ts; <HI>Charles</HI> VI. pu&s;hes great forces into <HI>Italy,</HI> and prepares for new Wars on the Side of <HI>Provence,</HI> but he wants Shipping to Tran&s;port his Forces into <HI>Spain,</HI> and unle&s;s the <HI>Con|federates</HI> &s;upply, he mu&s;t give it over in <HI>Catalonia.</HI></P>
<P>Death gives a great Blow in <HI>England,</HI> which will have an Effect upon the publick Mea&s;ures; but the QUEEN is Safe, and the Hopes of her Enemies are not &s;o high as before.</P>
<P>The Parties in <HI>England</HI> carry on a furious War, and fight many Battles, which, tho' without Blood, have very fatal Effects upon the Nation: Things look dark, and the People begin to &s;ee the Circum&s;tances their own Folly has brought them to: National Divi&s;ions threaten the Nations Peace, Trade lo&s;t, Credit &s;unk, and the People unea&s;y.</P>
<P>The Queen exhorts to Peace: What <HI>People</HI> but tho&s;e would let her per&s;wade in vain?</P>
<P>Great Strife at Court, heaving and thru&s;ting in and out; and every Head has his Party to pu&s;h on his Inte|re&s;t among the People, and make him appear formidable and popular</P>
<P>Some promi&s;ing Hopes of a <HI>General Peace</HI> begin to ap|pear, but it goes off again; the <HI>Emperor</HI> &s;tands out yet,
<PB N="10" REF="9">
and obtains &s;ome Allies more than was expected; <HI>France</HI> offers to re&s;tore to <HI>Britain,</HI> and make our Queen Arbitre&s;s of <HI>Europe; France</HI> re&s;olves to have a <HI>Peace</HI> with <HI>Britain</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> by Granting rather more than they Ask.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="6">
<HEAD>Sixth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>STill they Fight on, and Treat on; nor does any Suc|ce&s;s on this Side or that influence the <HI>Plenipotenti|aries</HI> on either Side: The <HI>French</HI> decline coming to any de|ci&s;ive Action, but &s;tand on the defen&s;ive in all <HI>Places,</HI> ex|cept <HI>Spain,</HI> that no Blow in the Field may oblige them to yield to meaner Terms than they were willing to &s;toop to before.</P>
<P>The uncommon Symptoms of <HI>Europe</HI>'s Di&s;tre&s;s, now &s;hew that they were not vain Signals; the Earthquake in <HI>Saxony</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> of the Oxen in <HI>Pa|dua</HI> and other parts of <HI>Italy;</HI> the &s;trange <HI>Di&s;temper:</HI> that raged both among Men and Hor&s;es: What were they but Fore-runners of the <HI>Plague</HI> which this Year, and about this time of the Year invades many Countries in <HI>Europe</HI> with a dreadful Violence.</P>
<P>La&s;t Year I foretold you it &s;hould come into <HI>Turkey</HI> and <HI>Hungaria,</HI> and both of them have prov'd true: <HI>Con|&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hall Bury an Hundred Thou&s;and e'er this Year &s;hall enter far in; <HI>Belgrade</HI> and <HI>Buda</HI> have found it true al&s;o from both the&s;e: Expect it now in the <HI>Do|minion</HI> of the <HI>Venetian</HI> and the <HI>Emperor,</HI> and on both &s;ides the <HI>Adriatick Gulph.</HI></P>
<P>If <HI>Hamburgh</HI> e&s;capes not the Month of <HI>May, Britain</HI> e&s;capes not this Year, and if both e&s;cape this Year, let them take it for a Reprieve from Heaven till the next, to move them to Repentance before the Sword is drawn, and before the <HI>De&s;troyer</HI> lands among them.</P>
<P>Now the Intriegues of the <HI>Swedes</HI> and <HI>Tartar</HI> at <HI>Ben|der</HI> break out; and the <HI>Turks</HI> again animated again&s;t the <HI>Mu&s;covices,</HI> threaten a new War, but no Action on ei|ther Side yet.</P>
<P>The Councils of <HI>Europe</HI> are now univer&s;ally perplex'd
<PB N="11" REF="10">
and great Revolutions will happen in divers parts of the World, nor will the lea&s;t of them happen among us and our Allies.</P>
<P>The War in the <HI>North</HI> begins to grow formidable to the re&s;t of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the <HI>Policies</HI> of the <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> and King of <HI>Poland</HI> threaten the <HI>Empire.</HI> A Great <HI>Prince,</HI> hitherto an Enemy to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>French</HI> Councils, ap|pears now acted and influenc'd by the Council of <HI>Ver|&s;ailles,</HI> at lea&s;t as far as may &s;erve to threaten <HI>Europe,</HI> and force the Confederates to turn their Eyes to the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and divert them from other Efforts.</P>
<P>At la&s;t the <HI>Dane</HI> is Ruin'd by the War with <HI>Sweden,</HI> and obliged by the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> to give over his <HI>De&s;igns,</HI> and &s;it &s;till, and glad to do it too, without the <HI>Swedes</HI> falling upon them.</P>
<P>Death threatens a <HI>Great Per&s;on</HI> in the <HI>Hanover</HI> Court; but <HI>Britain</HI> having no le&s;s than four immediate &s;ucceed|ing Heirs there to her Crown, need not fear having an Occa&s;ion to make a new Settlement of the Entail.</P>

<P>WAR and <HI>Pe&s;tilence</HI> are now in their Heighth, and Reap the &s;ad Bloody Harve&s;t of <HI>Europe:</HI> I will hope <HI>Great-Britain, Holland</HI> and <HI>France</HI> &s;hall E&s;cape this Year, but dare not expect any longer Sparing; yet Men Repent not, and <HI>Princes</HI> of the World pu&s;h on their Ambitious De&s;igns as if Heaven was entirely at <HI>Peaece</HI> with them, and no Judgements gone out again&s;t them.</P>
<P>'Tis time now for <HI>Europe</HI> to undo what, for ten Years pa&s;t, they have been doing, <HI>viz.</HI> aggrandizing the Wild and Barbarous Nation of the <HI>Mu&s;covites,</HI> who by a &s;mall Advantage in <HI>Pomeren,</HI> growing forward, talk in|&s;olently to the <HI>Princes</HI> and Powers of <HI>Europe,</HI> and be|gin to intermeddle with the Affairs of the Emperor; but he receives &s;ome <HI>Threats</HI> from the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which he re&s;ents very much.</P>
<P>The King of <HI>France</HI> declines apace both in Health and Fortune, and is either in, or very near his Repo&s;i|tory. About <HI>September</HI> the Di&s;&s;entions among the Po|pi&s;h Clergy ri&s;e to a great Heighth in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and threaten the Popi&s;h Hierarchy of <HI>Europe</HI> with &s;uch Divi&s;ions as &s;hall end in the preparing of <HI>People</HI> for the

<P>The&s;e <HI>Divi&s;ions</HI> &s;lacken the Heat of the Popi&s;h Clergy again&s;t the Prote&s;tants in <HI>France;</HI> and in <HI>Languedoc</HI> they appear more open than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>A great Faction in the <HI>French</HI> Court about the lat|ter end of the Year, and a great Man carries it &s;o high, that his Grandfather appears unea&s;ie at him, and &s;omething Jealous. A great General quite out of Fa|vour; Mon&s;ieur <HI>Villars</HI> Oppo&s;es the Duke of <HI>Berry,</HI> and threatens him with the King's Di&s;plea&s;ure, which he re|&s;ents to a Degree implacable.</P>

<HEAD>Tenth Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>A&s;eeming Conclu&s;ion of the Peace has been now the Effect of a large <HI>Treaty: France</HI> oppre&s;s'd by the War, makes larger Conce&s;&s;ions, and the Influence of &s;ome Princes a&s;&s;i&s;t: The Emperor, tho' not able to effect all his De&s;igns, &s;eems more flexible to Conditions, being willing to get <HI>Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies</HI> from the <HI>French,</HI> yet the many Intere&s;ts which the &s;everal Parties pur&s;ue in this War, are not &s;o ea&s;ie to be adju&s;ted as that a full Conclu&s;ion can be made.</P>
<P>In <HI>Flanders</HI> the utmo&s;t Artifice is made u&s;e of on both Sides, as well to pu&s;h on, as to fend off the War. The <HI>French</HI> lo&s;e Ground, and the Confederates make odd Attacks; and this &s;hewing only a long retracting of the War, which many are weary of, and make a Handle to pre&s;s to Peace.</P>
<P>We find the Conclu&s;ions at <HI>&V;trecht</HI> unable to put a final End to Jealou&s;ies and War; and tho' we have now the Appearance of Peace, they all &s;tand with Sword it Hand, as if ready to break out into a New War.</P>
<P>The <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covites</HI> go to War in Earne&s;t; and about this Month &s;ome Action happens between them to the Di&s;advantage of the <HI>Mu&s;covites:</HI> The King of <HI>Sweden</HI> is now in the Field, and his Affairs in <HI>Pomeren</HI> take a new Turn.</P>

<HEAD>Eleventh Prophecy.</HEAD>
<P>SOme People think the Peace of <HI>Europe</HI> is &s;ettled now, and &s;ome think it as far off as ever; yet new Mea|&s;ures at Court make new Divi&s;ions among the <HI>Parties:</HI> Great Di&s;content about Management endangers the New Mini&s;try, and if a thorow Change does not happen in the <HI>Briti&s;h Court,</HI> it will be nearer to it than ever it was before, and the E&s;cape very Narrow.</P>
<P><HI>Scotland</HI> feels great Di&s;orders about this Time, and Things look very dark on that Side. Some popular Riots happen, as is u&s;ual, in Di&s;temper'd Countries be|fore more publick Commotions happen.</P>
<P><HI>Britain,</HI> like a Body neither Sick or Well, enjoys neither <HI>Peace,</HI> or makes <HI>War;</HI> and the Di&s;atisfactions at Home &s;well up &s;o, that hone&s;t Men know not which to de&s;ire: The <HI>French</HI> rejoice at a <HI>Peace,</HI> &s;ome here call it &s;o, but others &s;ay it is Criminal to call it a <HI>Peace,</HI> and that a War is nearer a Peace than the Condition we are in at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>The <HI>Dutch,</HI> and &s;ome other Confederates, not think|ing them&s;elves kindly u&s;ed in, or &s;ecure by the late Treaty, Arm, and refu&s;e to Declare them&s;elves upon what Occa&s;ion &s;everal Endeavours are u&s;ed to foment a Breach between the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> but do not bring Things to that heighth yet.</P>
<P>Winter and cold Weather makes Health encrea&s;e a little, and the Pe&s;tilence &s;tops; but the War goes on in the <HI>North</HI> with great Fury, and the <HI>Swedes</HI> prevail in &s;everal Places.</P>

<P>THE Year ends on our Side with Plans, Schemes, <HI>Plots</HI> and <HI>De&s;igns</HI> of <HI>Parties</HI> for the next: <HI>French</HI> Intere&s;ts and <HI>French Parties</HI> influence too much our Af|fairs; and the Knowledge of it makes every Man, and every party of <HI>Men</HI> Jealous of each other.</P>
<P><HI>France</HI> has made but too much Advantage of the Divi&s;ions of the Year among the Confederates, and has obtain'd &s;ome advantageous Conditions, which if they had been better United, he could never have arrived to; yet the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Court has given Checks to &s;ome of his Encroachments, and talks roughly to him about &s;ome others, on which he abates &s;ome Preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>What is wanting to fix and &s;ettle a General Peace, and what Conditions were Agreed to, they now begin to put in Execution, and to &s;ettle the General Quiet.</P>
