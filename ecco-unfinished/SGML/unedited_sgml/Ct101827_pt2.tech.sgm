<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>PART of this Poem had the honour
of your Lord&s;hip's peru&s;al when in ma|nu&s;cript,
and it was no &s;mall pride to
me, when it met with approbation from
&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hing a judge: Should the re&s;t
find the like indulgence, I &s;hall have no
occa&s;ion (whatever its &s;ucce&s;s may be in
the world) to repent the labour it has co&s;t
me&mdash;But my intention is not to pur&s;ue a
di&s;cour&s;e on my own performance; no, my
Lord, it is to embrace this opportunity of
throwing out &s;entiments that relate to
your Lord&s;hip's goodne&s;s, the genero&s;ity of
which, give me leave to &s;ay, I have greatly
experienced.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="5">
I offer it not as a new remark, that de|pendance
on the Great, in former times,
generally terminated in di&s;appoinment; nay,
even their bounty (if it could be called
&s;uch) was, in its very nature, ungenerous.
It was, perhaps, with-held, through an in|dolent
or wilful neglect, 'till tho&s;e, who
lingered in the want of it, grew almo&s;t pa&s;t
the &s;en&s;e of comfort. At length it came,
too often, in a manner that half cancelled
the obligation, and, perchance, mu&s;t have
been acquired too by &s;ome previous act of
guilt in the receiver, the con&s;equence of
which was remor&s;e and infamy.</P>
<P>But that I live, my Lord, is a proof
that dependance on your Lord&s;hip, and the
pre&s;ent Mini&s;try, is an a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s.
I am per&s;uaded, di&s;tre&s;s, in many other
in&s;tances, affects your &s;oul with a com|pa&s;&s;ion,
that always &s;hews it&s;elf in a manner
mo&s;t humane and active; that to forgive
injuries, and confer benefits, is your de|light;
<PB N="v" REF="6">
and that to de&s;erve your friend&s;hip
is to de&s;erve the countenance of the be&s;t of
men. To be admitted into the honour of
your Lord&s;hip's conver&s;ation (permit me
to &s;peak but ju&s;tice) is to be elegantly in|troduced
into the mo&s;t in&s;tructive, as well
as entertaining, parts of literature; it is to
be furni&s;hed with the fine&s;t ob&s;ervations
upon human nature, and to receive, from
the mo&s;t una&s;&s;uming, &s;weet, and winning
candour, the worthie&s;t and mo&s;t polite
maxims&mdash;&s;uch as are always enforced by
the actions of your own life. I could al&s;o
take notice of your many public-&s;pirited
&s;ervices to your country in Parliament, and
your con&s;tant attachment to Liberty, and
the Royal, Illu&s;trious Hou&s;e of our Mo&s;t
Gracious Sovereign; but, my Lord, be|lieve
me, your own deeds are the noble&s;t
and fitte&s;t orators to &s;peak your prai&s;e,
and will elevate it far beyond the power
of a much abler writer than I am.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="7">
I will therefore turn my view from your
Lord&s;hip's virtues to the kind influence of
them, which has been &s;o lately &s;hed upon
me; and then, if my future morals and
writings &s;hall gain any approbation from
men of parts and probity, I mu&s;t acknow|ledge
all to be the product of your Lord|&s;hip's
goodne&s;s to me. I mu&s;t, in fine,
&s;ay with Horace,</P>
<P>Quod &s;piro, &amp; placeo, (&s;i placeo) tuum e&s;t.</P>
<P>I am, with the highe&s;t gratitude and
veneration,</P>
<CLOSER>MY LORD,
Your Lord&s;hip's mo&s;t dutiful
And devoted &s;ervant,

<P>THE reader will ea&s;ily perceive the&s;e
ver&s;es were begun, when my heart was
gayer than it has been of late; and fini&s;hed
in hours of the deepe&s;t melancholy.</P>
<P>I hope the world will do me the ju&s;tice
to believe, that no part of this flows from
any real anger again&s;t the Lady, to whom
it is in&s;cribed. Whatever unde&s;erved &s;eve|rities
I may have received at her hands,
would &s;he deal &s;o candidly as acknowledge
truth, &s;he very well knows, by an expe|rience
of many years, that I have ever be|haved
my&s;elf towards her, like one who
thought it his duty to &s;upport with patience
all afflictions from that quarter. Indeed,
if I had not been capable of forgiving a
Mother, I mu&s;t have blu&s;hed to receive par|don
my&s;elf at the hands of my Sovereign.</P>
<P>Neither, to &s;ay the truth, were the man|ner
of my birth all, &s;hould I have any
rea&s;on for complaint&mdash;When I am a little
di&s;po&s;ed to a gay turn of thinking. I con|&s;ider,
as I was a Derelict from my cradle,
I have honour of a lawful claim to the be&s;t
protection in Europe. For being a &s;pot
of earth, to which nobody pretends a title,
I devolve naturally upon the King, as one
of the rights of his Royalty.</P>
<P><PB REF="90">
While I pre&s;ume to name his Maje&s;ty,
I look back, with confu&s;ion, upon the
mercy I have lately experienced; becau&s;e
it is impo&s;&s;ible to remember it, but with
&s;omething I would fain forget, for the &s;ake
of my future peace, and alleviation of my
pa&s;t misfortune.</P>
<P>I owe my life to the Royal Pity, if a
wretch can, with propriety, be &s;aid to live,
who&s;e days are fewer than his &s;orrows;
and to whom death had beeen but a re|demption
from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>But I will &s;uffer my pardon as my pu|ni&s;hment,
till that life, which has &s;o gra|ciou&s;ly
been given me, &s;hall become con|&s;iderable
enough not to be u&s;ele&s;s in his
&s;ervice to whom it was forfeited. Under
influence of the&s;e &s;entiments, with which
His Maje&s;ty's great goodne&s;s has in&s;pired
me, I con&s;ider my lo&s;s of fortune and dig|nity
as my happine&s;s; to which, as I am
born without ambition, I am thrown from
them without repining&mdash;Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e
advantages, my care had been, perhaps,
but how to enjoy life; by the want of them
I am taught this nobler le&s;&s;on, to &s;tudy
how to de&s;erve it.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT elegant ta&s;te in poetry, which
is hereditary to your Lord&s;hip, together
with that particular regard with which you
honour the author to whom the&s;e papers
relate, make me imagine this collection
may not be unplea&s;ing to you. And I may
pre&s;ume to &s;ay, the pieces them&s;elves are
not unworthy your Lord&s;hip's patronage,
my own part in it excepted. I &s;peak only
of THE AUTHOR TO BE LET, having no
title to any other, not even the &s;mall ones
out of the Journals. May I be permitted
to declare (to the end I may &s;eem not quite
&s;o unworthy of your Lord&s;hip's favour,
as &s;ome writers of my age and circum&s;tan|ces)
that I never was concern'd in any
<PB N="240" REF="235">
Journals. I ever thought the exorbitant
liberty, which mo&s;t of tho&s;e papers take
with their &s;uperiors, unju&s;tifiable in any
rank of men; but dete&s;table in &s;uch, who
do it merely for hire, and without even
the bad excu&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and re&s;entment.
On the contrary, being once inclined, upon
&s;ome advantageous propo&s;als, to enter into
a paper of another kind, I immediately de|&s;i&s;ted,
on finding admitted into it (though,
as the publi&s;her told me, purely by an
accident) two or three lines reflecting on a
great mini&s;ter. Were my life ever &s;o un|happy,
it &s;hall not be &s;tain'd with a con|duct,
which my birth at lea&s;t (though
neither my education nor good fortune)
&s;hould &s;et me above; much le&s;s with any
ingratitude to that noble per&s;on, to who&s;e
interce&s;&s;ion (next to his Maje&s;ty's goodne&s;s)
I owe in a great mea&s;ure that life it&s;elf.</P>

I believe your Lord&s;hip will pardon this
digre&s;&s;ion, or any other which keeps me
from the &s;tyle you &s;o much hate&mdash;of Dedi|cation.</P>
<P>I will not pretend to di&s;play tho&s;e ri&s;ing
virtues in your Lord&s;hip, which the next
age will certainly know without my help,
but rather relate (what el&s;e it will as cer|tainly

papers, and the occa&s;ion which produced
the War of the Dunces (for &s;o it has been
commonly call'd) which begun in the Year
1727, and ended in 1730.</P>
<P>When Dr. Swift and Mr. Pope thought
it proper, for rea&s;ons &s;pecified in the pre|face
to their mi&s;cellanies, to publi&s;h &s;ome
little pieces of theirs as had ca&s;ually got
abroad, there was added to them the Trea|ti&s;e
of the Bathos, or the Art of Sinking
in Poetry. It happened, that in one chap|ter
of this piece, the &s;everal &s;pecies of bad
poets were ranged in cla&s;&s;es, to which were
prefixed almo&s;t all the letters of the alpha|bet
<PB N="242" REF="237">
(the greate&s;t part of them at random);
but &s;uch was the number of poets eminent
in that art, that &s;ome one or other took
every letter to him&s;elf: All fell into &s;o
violent a fury, that for half a year or more,
the common news-papers (in mo&s;t of which
they had &s;ome property, as being hired
writers) were filled with the mo&s;t abu&s;ive
fal&s;hoods and &s;currilities they could po&s;&s;i|bly
devi&s;e. A liberty no way to be won|dered
at in tho&s;e people, and in tho&s;e pa|pers,
that, for many years during the un|controled
licence of the pre&s;s, had a&s;per&s;ed
almo&s;t all the great characters of the age;
and this with impunity, their own per&s;ons
and names being utterly &s;ecret and ob&s;cure.</P>
<P>This gave Mr. Pope the thought, that
he had now &s;ome opportunity of doing
good, by detecting and dragging into
light the&s;e common enemies of mankind;
&s;ince to invalidate this univer&s;al &s;lander, it
&s;ufficed to &s;hew what contemptible men
were the authors of it. He was not with|out
<PB N="243" REF="238">
hopes, that, by manife&s;ting the dullne&s;s
of tho&s;e who had only malice to recommend
them, either the book&s;ellers would not find
their account in employing them, or the
men them&s;elves, when di&s;covered, want
courage to proceed in &s;o unlawful an occu|pation.
This it was that gave birth to The
Dunciad, and he thought it an happine&s;s,
that by the late flood of &s;lander on him|&s;elf,
he had acquired &s;uch a peculiar right
over their names as was nece&s;&s;ary to this
de&s;ign.</P>
<P>On the 12th of March 1729, at St.
James's, that poem was pre&s;ented to the
King and Queen (who had before been
plea&s;ed to read it) by the right honourable
Sir Robert Walpole: And &s;ome days
after, the whole impre&s;&s;ion was taken and
di&s;per&s;ed by &s;everal noblemen and per&s;ons
of the fir&s;t di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>It is certainly a true ob&s;ervation, that no
people are &s;o impatient of cen&s;ure as tho&s;e
who are the greate&s;t &s;landerers; which was
<PB N="244" REF="239">
wonderfully exemplified on this occa&s;ion.
On the day the book was fir&s;t vended, a
crowd of authors be&s;ieged the &s;hop; en|treaties,
advices, threats of law, and bat|tery,
nay cries of trea&s;on were all employed,
to hinder the coming out of The Dunciad:
On the other &s;ide, the book&s;ellers and
hawkers made as great efforts to procure
it: What could a few poor authors do
again&s;t &s;o great a majority as the publick?
there was no &s;topping a torrent with a fin|ger,
&s;o out it came.</P>
<P>Many ludicrous circum&s;tances attended
it: The Dunces (for by this name they
were called) held weekly clubs, to con&s;ult
of ho&s;tilities again&s;t the author; one wrote
a letter to a great mini&s;ter, a&s;&s;uring him
Mr. Pope was the greate&s;t enemy the go|vernment
had; and another bought his
image in clay, to execute him in effigy;
with which &s;ad &s;ort of &s;atisfactions the
gentlemen were a little comforted.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="240">
Some fal&s;e editions of the book having
an owl in their fronti&s;piece, the true one,
to di&s;tingui&s;h it, fixed in its &s;tead an a&s;s
laden with authors. Then another &s;urrep|titious
one being printed with the &s;ame a&s;s,
the new edition in octavo returned for di&s;|tinction
to the owl again. Hence aro&s;e a

&s;ome recommending the edition
of the owl, and others the edition of the
a&s;s; by which names they came to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed,
to the great honour al&s;o of the
gentlemen of The Dunciad.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip will not think the&s;e par|ticulars
altogether unentertaining; nor are
they impertinent, &s;ince they clear &s;ome pa&s;|&s;ages
in the following collection. The

<P><PB N="246" REF="241">
However, the imperfection of this col|lection
cannot but be owned, as long as it
wants that poem with which you, my Lord,
have honoured the author of The Dunciad;
but which I dur&s;t not pre&s;ume to add in

<HEAD>THE
PUBLISHER'S PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following piece was accidentally drop|ped
near the Mews-gate. I picked it up in my
way from Charing-cro&s;s to Hedge-lane. It was
in a leathern ca&s;e, which had once been red,
but was grown black with grea&s;e, and tied round
with a &s;crap of dirty tape. When I opened the
parcel, I found by an ingenious epigram, that
this tape had formerly belonged to Mrs. Hay|wood,
(the divine Eliza!) but whether it had
bound her hair, or was part of her apron-&s;tring,
I &s;hould have been at a lo&s;s to learn, had not
the relict been &s;anctified by Mr. Moore's mu&s;e.
He tritely compared it to Cytherea's girdle,
and &s;ent it as a valuable pledge of friend&s;hip to
our author. In this packet were &s;everal letters
directed to Mr. I&s;cariot Hackney, dated from the
Ship-tavern, Charing-cro&s;s, and &s;igned J. m. s
M &hellip; Sm. th, L. Theobald, L. Wel&s;ted, Ed|mund
Curl, John Dennis, Thomas Cooke,
and Bezaleel Morris. Tho&s;e of the earlie&s;t im|port,
that J. m. s M &hellip; Sm. th, E&s;&abque; was
unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en &s;peaker of this &s;ociety. I
met with many more informations of this nature;
<PB N="248" REF="243">
but what plea&s;ed me mo&s;t, was the performance
of our author. I was curious to find out &s;o ex|cellent
a writer, and have entered into a treaty
with him for future memoirs, which I have en|gaged
to give the public.</P>
<P>It is with much glee that I have marked the
herd bellowing again&s;t The Dunciad for indelica|cies.
Not to mention with what an ill grace
this critici&s;m comes from that quarter, I fancy
it may ea&s;ily be proved, that the gro&s;&s;e&s;t of tho&s;e
images are mo&s;t &s;uitable to the &s;ubject; a &s;ub|ject
compo&s;ed, for the mo&s;t part, of authors,
who&s;e writings are the refu&s;e of wit, and who in
life are as the very excrement of nature; yet
even here, Mr. Pope &s;hews him&s;elf a ma&s;ter.
It is true, that he has u&s;ed dung; but he di&s;|po&s;es
that dung in &s;uch a manner, that it
becomes rich manure, from which he rai&s;es a
variety of fine flowers. He deals in rags; but
deals with them like an arti&s;t, who commits
them to a paper-mill, and brings them out u&s;e|ful
&s;heets. The chymi&s;t extracts a fine cordial
from the mo&s;t nau&s;eous of all dung, and Mr.
Pope has drawn a &s;weet poetical &s;pirit from the
mo&s;t offen&s;ive and unpoetical objects of the
creation&mdash;unpoetical, though eternal writers of
poetry.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="244">
I have al&s;o laughed at the clamour of the
gentlemen of the Bathos again&s;t The Dunciad,
for in&s;ulting them on their poverty. I own that
a man's poverty, when it proceeds not from any
folly, but is owing (as it often happens) to his
virtue, &s;ets him in an amiable light. He be|comes
the object of compa&s;&s;ion; and, if he bears
his misfortunes like a man, in&s;tead of falling in|to
contempt, rai&s;es our admiration. But when
his wants are of his own &s;eeking, and prove the
motive of every ill action (for the poverty of bad
authors has always a bad heart for its com|panion),
is it not a vice, and properly the &s;ubject
of &s;atire?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e per&s;ons are of a very low pa|rentage,
and without any pretence of merit are
a&s;piring to the rank of gentlemen. Thus they
become ill oeconomi&s;ts; poverty is the con&s;e|quence
of ill oeconomy, and dirty tricks the
con&s;equence of their poverty. Though they are
&s;ad writers, they might have been good me|chanics;
and therefore by endeavouring to &s;hine
in &s;pheres to which they are unequal, are guilty
of depriving the public of many that might have
been its u&s;eful members.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="245">
Methinks when the world is &s;o ungrateful as
not to read their writings, they might vouch|&s;afe
to follow the example of the great Sir
Walter Raleigh (though an author undoubtedly
inferior to them), who, when he heard the Fir&s;t
Part of his Hi&s;tory &s;ucceeded not, had &s;pirit
enough to commit the &s;econd to the flames.
But the gentlemen of the Bathos are apt, like
bad hor&s;es, to run fa&s;ter immediately after
&s;tumbling. Should the author of the Dunciad
declare, that the great Mr. Dennis (the &s;on of a
&s;adler) had better have been a common pari&s;h|crier,
than a poet or critic! have not forty
years, and upwards, witne&s;&s;ed the truth of this?
Is it not evident, that his poverty re&s;ults from a
mi&s;application of his talents?</P>
<P>Had it not been an hone&s;ter and more decent
livelihood for Mr. Norton (Daniel de Foe's &s;on
of love, by a lady who vended oy&s;ters) to have
dealt in a fi&s;h-market, than to be dealing out the
dialects of Billing&s;gate and detraction in the
Flying Po&s;t?</P>
<P>Should not Dick Morley rather have been
blacking &s;hoes at the corners of &s;treets, (to which
it is well known his indu&s;trious, and more pru|dent
younger brother &s;ubmitted), than blackening
<PB N="251" REF="246">
reputations in The Hi&s;tory of Mother Wi&s;ebourn,
and Weekly Journals? The blackening of the
bru&s;h from the japan-pot is &s;o u&s;eful and orna|mental,
that it is frequently called Honour; but
the da&s;h of Dick's pen, &s;o often dipped in an
ink-&s;tandi&s;h, is dirty, and detrimental, con&s;e|quently
di&s;honour; &s;o that Dick and his brother
illu&s;trate St. Paul's &s;aying, &startq;Some are made to
honour, and &s;ome to di&s;honour.&endq;</P>
<P>Had it not been more laudable in Mr. Roome,
the &s;on of an undertaker, to have borne a link,
and a mourning-&s;taff in the long proce&s;&s;ion of a
funeral, than to have been frequently lamenting
the burials of his mi&s;erable, &s;hort-lived libels?
Had it not been more decent in him, to have
&s;ung p&s;alms, according to education, in an Ana|bapti&s;t
Meeting, than to have been altering The
Jovial Crew, or Merry Beggars, into a wicked
imitation of The Beggar's Opera?</P>
<P>Mr. Thomas Cooke, the tran&s;lator of He&s;iod,
is the &s;on of a Muggletonian-teacher, who kept
a little ob&s;cure alehou&s;e at Braintree in E&s;&s;ex.
Though this author has no more genius for poetry
than a &s;nail, nay, le&s;s than Mr. Ambro&s;e Phil|lips,
or Mr. Wel&s;ted; and though he would,
con&s;equently, have wanted &s;pirit enough for his
<PB N="252" REF="247">
father's tap&s;ter, yet his enemies confe&s;s him not
without merit. To do the man ju&s;tice, he
might have made a tolerable figure as a taylor.
It were too pre&s;umptuous to affirm he could have
been a ma&s;ter in any profe&s;&s;ion; but, dull as I al|low
him, he would not have been de&s;picable for a
third, or fourth-hand journeyman. Then had
his wants been avoided; for he would, at lea&s;t,
have learned &lsquo;To cut his coat according to
his cloth.&endq;</P>
<P>Why would not Mr. Theobald continue an
attorney? Is not word-catching more &s;erviceable
in &s;plitting a cau&s;e, than in explaining a fine
poet?</P>
<P>When Mrs. Haywood cea&s;ed to be a &s;trolling
actre&s;s, why might not the lady (though once a
theatrical queen) have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by turning
wa&s;her-woman? Has not the fall of greatne&s;s
been a frequent di&s;tre&s;s in all ages? She might
have caught a beautiful bubble as it aro&s;e from
the &s;uds of her tub, blown it in air, &s;een it glit|ter,
and then break! Even in this low condi|tion,
&s;he had played with a bubble, and what
more is the vanity of human greatne&s;s? She
might have al&s;o con&s;idered the &s;ullied linen grow|ing
white in her pretty red hands, as an emblem
<PB N="253" REF="248">
of her &s;oul, were it well &s;coured by repentance
for the &s;ins of her youth: but &s;he rather choo&s;es
&s;tarving by writing novels of intrigue, to teach
young heire&s;&s;es the art of running away with
fortune-hunters, and &s;candalizing per&s;ons of the
highe&s;t worth and di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>When this lady, or the&s;e gentlemen are a&s;ked,
Why they abu&s;e &s;uch and &s;uch per&s;ons? their
an&s;wer is, they are obliged to write for want of
money, and to abu&s;e for want of other &s;ubjects.
Is want of money an excu&s;e for picking a poc|ket?
or what is wor&s;e, taking away a man's
good name? Is the poverty of Moore's genius
an excu&s;e for filching Pope's lines? And appears
not the theft in his comedy as plain, as if a
cinder-wench &s;hould &s;teal a gold watch, and
afterwards wear it? If this play was brought
forth, becau&s;e his circum&s;tances were reduced,
was he to retrieve them by committing poetical
felonies, and afterwards being the fir&s;t to cry out
Thief? De&s;erves he not a whipping for &s;uch
petty-larceny? By a whipping be it known, I
only mean the poetical, whole&s;ome $a&s;h of &s;atire.
A Dani&s;h colonel has lately conde&s;cended to be
a common centinel, and were Jemmy's heart as
firm as his countenance, had it not been more
<PB N="254" REF="249">
graceful in him to have carried a grenadier's cap,
a buff-coat, and a brown mu&s;quet? He is a pro|per
figure, and of an exact &s;ize for his Pru&s;&s;ian
maje&s;ty's &s;ervice. Then had his comedy been
frittered into Oxford je&s;ts; each of his ac|quaintance
had claimed their own, and he e&s;cap|ed
the hi&s;&s;es and hor&s;e-laughs of the town, for
&s;poiling and mi&s;applying them in a damned play.</P>
<P>Methinks Laurus had better been an univer|&s;ity
vintner, than a divine, or poet. Would not
bad wine have been ea&s;ier put off than bad
poetry? Had not a bunch of grapes flouri&s;hed
more naturally on his brow, than a &s;prig of
bays? Had he not with more propriety been
&s;een &s;itting a&s;tride a butt, with a bottle in one
hand, and a bumper in the other, roaring out a
merry catch, than mounting, after the fir&s;t &s;tave,
to thump a pulpit-cu&s;hion, and pau&s;e at every
half &s;entence with a hiccup?</P>
<P>If poverty in the&s;e lights is judged not a &s;ub|ject
for ridicule, I refer the reader to I&s;cariot
Hackney, and after his acquaintance with that
&s;park, I will only addre&s;s my&s;elf in the&s;e few
words to the allies of Charing-cro&s;s. Say, gen|tlemen,
has the Dunciad la&s;hed your poverty?
A much &s;everer &s;atire on it you my find in your

<HEAD>AN
AUTHOR
TO BE LET.</HEAD>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P>I AM glad to find you meddle with the dirty work
of your brother journali&s;ts. To be inoffen&s;ive is a
puri$annical &s;pirit, and will never &s;ucceed in a free|thinking
age. What is gold it&s;elf (&s;ays the philo|&s;opher)
but dirt? It is dug out of dirty mines; and,
as a proof it retains its nature, we come at it ea&s;ie&s;t
through dirty means. Be a&s;&s;ured, a &s;cavenger of
wit is a more gainful occupation than that of a de|licate,
moral writer.</P>
<P>By this I mean to let you &s;ee my ability, and to
proffer my &s;ervice. You mu&s;t know when my mo|ther
was pregnant of me, &s;he once dreamed, &s;he was
delivered of a mon&s;ter. It was ob&s;erved al&s;o, at the
time of my birth, that a wea&s;el was heard to &s;hriek;
and a bat (though at noon-day) flew into the room,
and &s;ettled upon the widwife's wri&s;t, ju&s;t as &s;he re|ceived
me. While in the cradle I was very froward.
Early at &s;chool I di&s;covered a promi&s;ing genius for
mi&s;chief. I carried tales from one boy to another to
&s;et them a fighting, and afterwards to the ma&s;ter, to
<PB N="256" REF="251">
have them whipped. I had always cunning enough,
when I committed a fault, to lay the blame upon
another, and laugh'd to &s;ee him &s;uffer for it: A
&s;ure progno&s;tick of my future judgment in politicks!
I was fond of tearing away the legs and wings of flies,
of picking out the eyes of &s;ome little bird, or laming
&s;ome favourite lap-dog, merely by way of amu&s;e|ment.
This was only a &s;ign, that one time or other
I &s;hould have ill-nature enough for a great Wit. Now
I under&s;tand to be a great Wit, is to take a plea&s;ure
in giving every body pain, and to &s;hew no mercy to
a reputation, which is dearer to &s;ome fools than per|haps
a limb or an eye. I was al&s;o given to pilfer
whatever lay in my way: a proof only that I wou'd
never &s;cruple being a plagiary, &s;hou'd I turn author.
I was expert at almo&s;t every thing except learning
my book; but neither encouragement nor correction
could bring me to any &s;en&s;e of duty. I was always
very &s;ullen after being corrected; and if my ma&s;ter
forgave, and admoni&s;hed me in a friendly manner,
I all the while ridiculed the old Put (as I then call'd
him) by making mouths or horns over his &s;houlder.
This &s;hew'd I had always wit enough to laugh at the
common notion of gratitude. I hooted at any unfor|tunate
ill-dre&s;s'd per&s;on in the &s;treet, if he look'd
like a gentleman, and never fail'd to mock the in|f$rmities
of old age. When at a &s;ermon, I was very
full of play my&s;elf, and fond of interrupting the de|votion
<PB N="257" REF="252">
of others; &s;o that (I thank my &s;tars!) in my
youth I had a fa&s;honable contempt for religion. I
came young into the world with little education, le&s;s
money, and no vi&s;ible way of living: However, I
qualified my&s;elf (though of mean birth) for a gentle|man
of wit and humour about town. I have natu|rally
a &s;ourne&s;s of temper, a droll &s;olemnity of coun|tenance,
and a dry manner of joking upon &s;uch ac|cidents,
as fools who value them&s;elves upon huma|nity,
would be apt to compa&s;&s;ionate. I have al&s;o a
propen&s;ity to &s;neer upon all mankind, and particu|larly
upon tho&s;e who fancy they can oblige me.
The&s;e elegant qualities recommended me early to
the friend&s;hip of Dick Morley, author of Mother
Wi&s;eborn. We met frequently at a little &s;nug gam|ing-hou&s;e,
never yet di&s;covered by informing con&s;ta|bles.
A &s;imilitude of circum&s;tances and &s;ympathy
of &s;ouls endeared us to each other; and to him I
owe the improvements of my afore-mentioned facul|ties.
The&s;e he cultivated, and many others im|planted
in me of the like nature.</P>
<P>We commenced authors together. At my fir&s;t &s;et|ting
out I was hired by a reverend prebend to libel
Dean Swift for infidelity. Soon after I was employed
by Curl to write a merry tale, the wit of which was
its ob&s;cenity. This we agreed to palm upon the
world for a po&s;thumous piece of Mr. Prior. How|ever,
a certain lady, celebrated for certain liberties,
<PB N="258" REF="253">
had a curio&s;ity to &s;ee the real author. Curl, on my
promi&s;e that if I had a pre&s;ent, he &s;hould go &s;nacks,
&s;ent me to her. I was admitted while her lady&s;hip
was &s;hifting; and on my admittance, Mrs. Abigail
was ordered to withdraw. What pa&s;&s;ed between us,
a point of gallantry obliges me to conceal; but after
&s;ome extraordinary civilities, I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with a
pur&s;e of guineas, and a command to write a &s;equel
to my tale. Upon this I turned out &s;mart in dre&s;s,
bit Curl of his &s;hare, and run out mo&s;t of my mo|ney
in printing my works at my own co&s;t. But &s;ome
years after (ju&s;t at the time of his &s;tarving poor Pat|ti&s;on)
the varlet was revenged. He arre&s;ted me for
&s;everal months board, brought me back to my gar|ret,
and made me drudge on in my old dirty work.
'Twas in his &s;ervice that I wrote Ob&s;cenity and Pro|fanene&s;s,
under the names of Pope and Swift.
Sometimes I was Mr. Jo&s;eph Gay, and at others
theory Burnet, or Addi&s;on. I abridged hi&s;tories and
travels, tran&s;lated from the French what they never
wrote, and was expert at finding out new titles for
old books. When a notorious thief was hanged, I
was the Plutarch to pre&s;erve his memory; and when
a great man died, mine were his Remains, and mine
the account of his la&s;t will and te&s;tament. Had Mr.
Oldmixon and Mr. Curl agreed, my a&s;&s;i&s;tance had
probably been invited into father Bohour's logick,
and the critical hi&s;tory of England.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="254">
But before all this happened, a young nobleman
gratified me for letting &s;ome ver&s;es of mine be handed
about at court in manu&s;cript under his name. This
was the fir&s;t time that I ever heard my writings ge|nerally
commended. But alas! how &s;hort-lived the
applau&s;e! They unfortunately &s;tole into print, lo&s;t
their reputation at once, and I am now a&s;hamed to
write any more, as a per&s;on of quality. I am a
great joker, and deal in clinches, puns, quibbles,
gibes, conundrums, and carry-which-its. Many a
good time have I la&s;hed the whole body of clergy,
and cracked many a &s;mart joke upon the Trinity.
One of my books had the honour of being pre&s;ented
for a libel by the grand-jury, and another was
made a burnt-offering by the hands of the common
hangman. If an author writes a piece that has &s;uc|ce&s;s
in his own character, I abu&s;e him; but if in a
fictitious one, I endeavour to per&s;onate him, and
write a &s;econd part to his work. I am very deeply
read in all pieces of &s;candal, ob&s;cenity, and profane|ne&s;s,
particularly in the writings of Mrs. Haywood,
Henley, Wel&s;ted, Morley, Foxton, Cooke, De Foe,
Norton, Wool&s;ton, Dennis, Ned Ward, Concanen,
Journali&s;t Pitt, and the author of the Rival Modes.
From the&s;e I propo&s;e to compile a very grand work,
which &s;hall not be inferior to Utopia, Carimania,
Gulliverania, Art of Flogging, Daily Journal, Epi|grams
on the Dunciad, or Oratory Tran&s;actions;
<PB N="260" REF="255">
and, as this is de&s;igned for the u&s;e of young temp|lers,
it is hoped they will promote my &s;ub&s;cription.
Since private vices have been proved to be publick
benefits, I would venture to call it An u&s;eful Body
of Immorality, and print it in a broad, pompous
folio; but &s;uch a one as may very well be bound up
with Dean Smedley's intended Body of Divinity.</P>
<P>By the help of indexes, and technical dictionaries,
I work on every branch of learning. I pore often
over the volumes of State Tracts, whence I collect
paragraphs, which I mix with remarks of my own,
and range under &s;everal heads. Tho&s;e again&s;t a di&s;|carded
mini&s;ter I &s;end to the London Journal, or
Concanen's Daily, or Weekly Papers.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><LG>

is a precious fellow! I once loved him for his ingra|titude

virulent again&s;t a prime mini&s;ter (for I naturally hate

How long have I called up the &s;hades of Se|janus,
Buckingham, and Wol&s;ey, to compare them
to one who mortifies me by laughing at the compa|ri&s;on?
How long &s;hall I &s;till pre&s;s on one, whom I
continually call &s;tate-plunderer, and wicked mini&s;ter?

Perhaps till the world will maliciou&s;ly liken me to a
tailor's goo&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A compari&s;on of Dr. SOUTH'S.</NOTE>, which is at once hot and heavy.
Rather than &s;tand out of the play, I have penned pa|negyricks
in Mi&s;t or Fog on Rich's pantomimes, and
Theobald's Sheak&s;pear re&s;tored. I am always li&s;ted
by Mr. Lun the Harlequin, to hi&s;s the fir&s;t night at
any of the Drury-lane performances. Sometimes I
draw up challenges for the champions of Mr. Figg's
amphitheatre, and &s;ometimes for the di&s;putants of
Mr. Henley's oratory.</P>
<P>I have an excellent knack at birth-day odes, elo|gies,
acro&s;ticks, anagrams, epithalamiums, prologues,
recommendatory poems, rhimes for almanack-mak|ers,
and witty di&s;tichs for the &s;igns of country-inns
and ale-hou&s;es. When with an audible voice I &s;pout
forth my own ver&s;es, marvellous is their effect! The
very bell-man has been touched with envy&mdash;an au|thor,
who like Mr. Ralph<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Author of a poem called NIGHT.</NOTE>, has di&s;tingui&s;hed him|&s;elf
by Night; the &s;hrillne&s;s of my clamorous dun|ning
landlady has been charm'd into a &s;till attention!
Nay, the very bailiff, in act to ru&s;h upon me, has
&s;topped &s;hort to li&s;ten, and for a minute &s;u&s;pended
the rapacious palm that was to fall upon my &s;houl|ders!</P>
<P>I have well peru&s;ed the writings of Luke Milbourn,
Shadwell, Settle, Blackmore, and many others of our
<PB N="262" REF="257">
&s;tamp, notable for falt wit upon Dryden. From the&s;e
I have extracted curious hints to a&s;&s;i&s;t Wel&s;ted in his
new &s;atire again&s;t Pope, which was once (he told me)
to have been chri&s;tened Labeo. 'Tis yet an embrio,
and there are divers opinions about the birth of it.
Some expect it will &s;pring from his wi&s;e noddle, like
Minerva from the head of Jupiter, and work won|ders.
Others, that it will re&s;emble Milton's figure
of Sin coming from the brain of the father of lies.
Then, &s;ay they, it will damn its parent's reputation.
But mo&s;t are of opinion, that my brother has no re|putation
to lo&s;e, and therefore the brat will be &s;till-born.
'Tis po&s;&s;ible al&s;o he may mi&s;carry of his &s;e|cond
epi&s;tle to Mr. Pope, though James Moore
Smythe E&s;quire is to officiate man-midwife.</P>
<P>When a man of quality is di&s;tingui&s;hed for a wit,
or an encourager of it, I endeavour to &s;trike him for
a dedication; but I have generally been &s;o unhappy
as to di&s;gu&s;t my patrons, by prai&s;ing them in the
wrong place. For want of being acquainted with
polite life, I have unwittingly complimented a per&s;on
for an illu&s;trious birth, who really owed his ri&s;e en|tirely
to his merit. Thus have I cau&s;ed his enemies
to &s;neer, and, perhaps, to libel him for my &s;quab
complement; when, had I left him to his choice, he
had rather cho&s;e my &s;atire than my panegyrick.</P>
<P>I am as famous as one of the &s;uitors in Homer's
Ody&s;&s;ey, for dead-born je&s;ts. Many a &s;onnet of mine,
<PB N="263" REF="258">
and &s;everal Bouts Rimez that were filled up by me,
has Moore read, with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty, at White's
and the drawing-room, for his own; but as they were
mere &s;lips of my pen, and could be of no advantage
to my reputation (low as it &s;tands) I am contented
to humour his vanity, and forbear to claim them. I
a&s;&s;i&s;ted in a pretty play of words on the letter P. and
the adverti&s;ement of the Lady's writing-de&s;k. Soon
after I chopped &s;ides, and wrote the hi&s;tory of the
Norfolk Dumpling, the ver&s;es on the Norfolk Lan|thern,
Robin's Reign, Robin's Game, the Fall of
Mortimer, and many other popular libels on per&s;ons
who lea&s;t de&s;erved them; but the rea&s;on of that was,
becau&s;e they were of the mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Now is the &s;e&s;&s;ion of parliament, and the poetical
quarrels mu&s;t give way to the political. Con&s;equently
the affairs of &s;tate (as Abel in the play of the Com|mittee
ob&s;erves) &startq;will lie heavy upon my neck and
&s;houlders.&endq; It is a cu&s;tom among great generals to
&s;end &s;pies into an enemy's camp, and among politi|cians,
to employ 'em in foreign courts. I have there|fore
(as I am determined to oppo&s;e the mini&s;try)
&s;ettled a &s;ecret corre&s;pondence with &s;everal gentle|men
of the party-coloured cloth; men of dignity!
&s;uch as have no le&s;s an honour than that of holding
a plate in the pre&s;ence of &s;ome certain knights of
the blue ribbon. My bribe is a pot of ale, and my
intelligence the &s;craps of conver&s;ation that fall at the
<PB N="264" REF="259">
table of great mini&s;ters. By the&s;e I am enabled to
di&s;cu&s;s the matters in debate at the hou&s;e of com|mons,
and the congre&s;s of Soi&s;&s;ons, to &s;tate the debts
of the nation, to arraign the conduct of tho&s;e at the
helm, and to hold the balance of Europe, with as
much ea&s;e as a monkey does a che&s;nut, in my own
paw.</P>
<P>The time has been when, after an evening's hard
boo&s;ing, my brother bards (who have been what we
call &s;eedy, or crop-&s;ick) have bilked the publick
hou&s;e, and barbarou&s;ly left me in pawn for the reck|oning.
On this emergency I have written an account
of a &s;harp and bloody fight, a vi&s;ion in the air, or a
wonderful prophecy, to be hawked about &s;treets: And
(would you believe it?) even the&s;e productions of mine
have pa&s;&s;ed for de&s;igned wit, and I have &s;ilently
&s;neered to find the merit of them claimed and boa&s;ted
of by Jemmy Moore.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes taken it in my head, that I might
make a fortune by writing for the &s;tage. As a proof
that I have an excellent ta&s;te, I always de&s;pi&s;ed the
tragedies of Shake&s;pear, Otway, Young and Thom|&s;on,
and preferred with admiration a certain per&s;on's
operas at the Hay-market. I wonder that the &s;ucce&s;s
of the latter &s;hould be applied to Mr. Handell's mu|&s;ick,
or the performances of Sene&s;ino, Fau&s;tina, and
Cutzoni: The town in this have been &s;hamefully
blind to the merit of that gentleman. He has fol|lowed
<PB N="265" REF="260">
the ancients &s;o clo&s;ely in the propriety of his
conduct, the unity of his characters, the natural, va|riety
of pa&s;&s;ions, the &s;trength of &s;entiment, and the
elegance of diction, that I here invite him to join
with me in an Engli&s;h tragedy on an opera plan.</P>
<P>If the gentleman thinks this too arduous an under|taking,
let us venture at a lower ca&s;t! without any
recour&s;e to wit, humour, natural dialogue, &s;ongs
aptly introduced, or any other of tho&s;e trifles with
which the Beggar's Opera abounds, we have one &s;ure
comfort; that is, we cannot fall &s;hort of many late
performances of that kind, nor be excelled by Roome
and his led captain Concanen. Roome cannot excel
me, unle&s;s he excels him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have tried all means (but that fools call hone&s;t
ones) for a livelihood. I offered my &s;ervice for a &s;e|cret
&s;py to the &s;tate; but had not credit enough even
for that. When it was indeed very low with me, I
printed propo&s;als for a &s;ub&s;cription to my works, re|ceived
money, and gave receipts, without any inten|tion
of delivering the book. Though I have been no|toriou&s;ly
profane, and was never at an univer&s;ity,
I once aimed to be admitted into orders; but being
obliged to ab&s;cond lately from the pari&s;h-officers, on
account of a ba&s;tard child, and falling be&s;ides into
an unlucky &s;alivation, my character was &s;o &s;canda|lous,
that I could not prevail even on the lowe&s;t of
the Fleet-pri&s;on par&s;ons to &s;ign my te&s;timonials.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="261">
My la&s;t attempt was to have been a travelling tutor
to &s;ome young gentleman. If I am deficient in cla&s;|&s;ick
learning, I could yet have in&s;tructed him in the
laws of his own country; for tho' I never &s;tudied
Coke upon Littleton, yet I have conver&s;ed with bai|liffs
and petty-fogging attornies; nay, I have conned
over the abridgments of Giles Jacob; I could al&s;o
have read him lectures of politicks from e&s;&s;ays of my
own in Weekly Journals. What though I wanted
knowledge to make di&s;&s;ertations upon the languages,
manners, hi&s;tories, &s;tatues, coins, paintings, archi|tecture,
or any other curio&s;ities, ancient or modern,
of foreign climes; what though I could not have
traced out any one country in a map; could I not
have pillaged voyage-writers, and have taken the
reports of inn-keepers or po&s;tilions, to have told
where there were good wine, good beds, buxom girls,
and tall &s;teeples? Few foreign tutors under&s;tand the
dead languages; but if they play at cards, dance,
talk of things they never &s;aw, or, having, &s;een, could
not under&s;tand; if they put on the &s;waggering air of
half-pay captains, and &s;wear French military oaths
with a bon grace, will they not pa&s;s for men of wit,
experience and knowledge? I &s;hould have made a
very fa&s;hionable tutor, I would have &s;pirited up my
pupil to run away with a nun; and, if he aimed at
&s;maller game, not &s;crupled being pimp. I have &s;tu|died
phy&s;ick under the Anodyne Necklace doctor, and
<PB N="267" REF="262">
would have prepared and exported a whole cargo
of antivenereal pills for his &s;afety. No one, I
am per&s;uaded, will blame me, if I took this op|portunity
of feathering my own ne&s;t. I &s;hould, per|haps,
have made him pay ten per cent. for his
own money when I di&s;bur&s;ed it, and a guinea on
many occa&s;ions for his honour; twenty &s;hillings of
which I might have put into my own pocket. Who
knows, but I might have married &s;ome rich widow,
by &s;ecuring my pupil for one of her daughters?
I would have contrived he &s;hould have &s;tolen the
young lady to avoid paying her fortune. If this
&s;cheme failed, I had another, for which I am
afraid I might have been a little cen&s;ured; it was
only to have &s;et him at a gaming table (when abroad)
for about a thou&s;and pounds, and afterwards gone
&s;nacks with the &s;harpers. But on &s;econd thoughts,
where had been the hurt? When returned, and
at age, I could ea&s;ily have made him amends, by
negotiating a mortgage, or the &s;ale of a rever&s;ion
for him with hone&s;t Ch. rt. r. s.</P>
<P>Thus, though I had but a hundred a year, and
for no more than two or three years &s;ervice, I could
retire to Swi&s;&s;erland, or Wales, with about fifteen
hundred pounds in my pocket, and an annuity of
fifty pounds per annum for life. In &s;uch a retire|ment
I &s;hould have &s;et down to writing an Account
of my Travels. When tho&s;e were fini&s;hed, by care|fully
<PB N="268" REF="263">
extracting from Gazettes, I &s;hould have been
able to have left my executors the memoirs of my
own times; then would I have indulged my &s;pleen
again&s;t the pre&s;ent mini&s;ters, for neglecting to gra|tify
my merit. It is dangerous to anger a poet or
hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved, at the head of this letter, that I have
a drollery in my countenance: egad! it is as pecu|liar
a one as Roome's. We are &s;o like, that before
he &s;cribbled him&s;elf into preferment, we have ac|tually
been mi&s;taken for each other. Our looks
are &s;o happy, as to have pa&s;&s;ed off many a &s;aying
in conver&s;ation for wit and humour, that, when
publi&s;hed, has been thought flat: nay, the &s;ame
thing has been &s;aid of me, as was uttered by a cer|tain
wit (one very different from our rank) on him,
viz. That &startq;the r. g..&rsquo;s misfortune is, he cannot
print his face to his joke.&endq;</P>
<P>While I am thus delineating my features, permit
me to own, that I wi&s;h my portrait might &s;hine in a
mezzotento through the gla&s;s-windows of picture-&s;hops
in Fleet-&s;treet and St. Paul's Church-yard;
then &s;hould I be gazed on with admiration by mer|cers
'prentices! But I will, at lea&s;t, indulge my
vanity in appearing on a large &s;heet of paper, in a
wooden cut, which ingenious &s;chool-boys may de|light
to colour with yellow and red ochre. What a
glaring figure &s;hall I then make in the long piazza
<PB N="269" REF="264">
of Covent Garden! I &s;hall be &s;urrounded by voner|able
old ballads; and &s;everal of my family-pieces,
&s;uch as the Sinners Coat of Arms, and the dreadful
&s;ketches of Death, Judgment, and Damnation!
Thence &s;hall I be tran&s;lated to the naked walls of
country ale-hou&s;es, cobblers-&s;talls, and nece&s;&s;ary-hou&s;es!
&mdash;And thou, O R. M., thou who art my
other &s;elf! be this my glory! however different our
fortunes, however unlike the incidents of our lives;
yet, when&s;oever the countenance of I&s;cariot Hackney
is &s;een, thy own dear phiz will be called to remem|brance.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I am a perfect town author: I hate all
mankind, yet am occa&s;ionally a mighty patriot. I
am very poor, and owe my poverty to my merit;
that is, to my writings: I am as proud as I am
poor; yet, what is, &s;eemingly a contradiction, never
&s;tick at a mean action, when the welfare of the re|public
of letters, or, in other words, my own inte|re&s;t
is concerned. My pen, like the &s;word of a
Swi&s;s, or the pleading of a lawyer, is generally
employed for pay. There is one piece of advice,
gentlemen, which I would propo&s;e to you: if any
papers of a dead wit &s;hould fall into the hands of
a member of your &s;ociety, let him be &s;ure to print
them, though never &s;o derogatory to the per&s;on's
reputation, to get him&s;elf money; and if, among
whole heaps of indige&s;ted papers, he finds a few
<PB N="270" REF="265">
with large corrections and additions by another emi|nent
hand (which he well knows), let him be &s;ure
to &s;uppre&s;s that circum&s;tance in his publication.</P>
<P>But to return to my&s;elf&mdash;My pamphlets &s;ell many
more impre&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of celebrated writers;
the &s;ecret of this is, I learned from Curl to clap a
new title-page to the &s;ale of every half hundred;
&s;o that when my book&s;eller has &s;old two hundred
and fifty copies, my book generally enters into the
&s;ixth edition. It is reckoned a villainous action to
write a libel, but more &s;o to father one on a per&s;on
who neither wrote it, nor approves it; now, I own
I never &s;cruple to do both. When a man of figure,
(perhaps an ornament of his country) has been
cruelly a&s;per&s;ed in his life-time, I love to revive the
a&s;per&s;ion at his death: it is mirth to me to grieve a
whole family, by in&s;ulting his memory before his
body is cold in the grave. In this I imitate the
authority of &startq;Sarah the Quaker in the Shades, to
Lothario lately decea&s;ed.&endq; Though I am &s;o ready
to libel others, I am downright frightened if I but
hear of a &s;atire where my name is likely to be in|&s;erted.
When a per&s;on does me a favour, I either
&s;u&s;pect he has &s;ome de&s;ign on me, or think it le&s;s
than my due, and that he is obliged to me, becau&s;e
an author, for accepting it. I am very te&s;ty, if I
am not allowed dictator of my company; nor had I
ever a friend, whom I did not his ab&s;ence &s;acrifice
<PB N="271" REF="266">
to my je&s;t. I contemn the few who admire me, am
angry with the multitude who de&s;pi&s;e me, and
mortally hate all who have any ways obliged me.
I a&s;&s;ure you, I am very famous for &s;everal Trea|ti&s;es
in defence of Ingratitude: I never fail to il|lu&s;trate
them with the examples of Marcus Bru|tus
among the ancients, and very eminent &s;tate&s;men
among the moderns. My private re&s;entment, like
that of other great men, is always a public ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now, gentlemen, if you like me for a corre&s;|pondent,
my price is the price of a Journali&s;t, a
crown; and, in the &s;tyle of a love-bargain, half-wet,
half-dry. You may find me in a morning at
my lucubrations, over a quartern-pot in a Geneva-&s;hop
in Clare-Market; a hou&s;e, where I propo&s;e
many learned interviews with orator Henley, who
has removed his &s;tage to that place. I generally
dine with a brother bard, at one of the little cook's-&s;hops
near St. Martin's-Church, and probably &s;pend
the evening with him at a night-cellar in the Strand,
where I &s;hall be ready to enter into a treaty with,
you.</P>
<CLOSER>Yours,
<SIGNED>ISCARIOT HACKNEY.</SIGNED>
From my chamber,
Hockley-in-the-Hole.</CLOSER>
