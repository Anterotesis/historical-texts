<P>THE Author deems it improper to di&s;per&s;e this little local pamphlet by way of pre&s;ents in order to enli&s;t a party in its favour. He pa&s;&s;es it to the public through the common channel of a Book&s;eller's &s;hop, wi&s;hing it only to obtain that notice from the Sub&s;cribers to the York Lunatic A&s;ylum which the arguments it contains may de&s;erve.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I WILL not pretend that my motive for giving the &s;ubject of this pamphlet &s;o minute an inve&s;tigation is ab&s;olutely di&s;|intere&s;ted; yet I can &s;afely affirm, that if a cau&s;e much more laudable were not inti|mately connected with it, and ultimately dependent upon it, I &s;hould never have undertaken &s;o unplea&s;ing a ta&s;k.</P>
<P>The truth, &s;o far as re&s;pects my&s;elf, is briefly this:&mdash;About &s;ix years ago, in order to prevent an Orphan Youth, who had &s;hewn manife&s;t &s;igns of Lunacy, from coming on his pari&s;h, which I &s;u&s;pected would neither be willing nor compellable to take &s;uch care of him as his deplorable ca&s;e required, and having, as his malady was recent, &s;ome hopes of cure, I &s;ent him to the York Lunatic A&s;ylum. Since that time it has co&s;t me, for his maintenance only, exclu&s;ive of his apparel, the &s;um of above one hundred and twenty pounds. I do not mention this as a charge that would have been exorbitant in a place not originally founded on a chari|table principle, or greater than I might have
<PB N="vi" REF="4">
incurred by placing him in a private mad|hou&s;e, but only as an expence which, I believe, few per&s;ons would willingly put them&s;elves to for an individual unconnect|ed with them by any other tye than that of general humanity; and which, there|fore, if they had born it for &s;o long a time, and in the end perceived it mu&s;t yearly encrea&s;e, they would &s;urely take any ju&s;|tifiable means in their power either to le&s;&s;en in future, or finally to extingui&s;h.</P>
<P>The Orphan in que&s;tion is in the &s;trict|e&s;t &s;en&s;e of the term a <HI>Lunatic Pari&s;h Pau|per</HI>, withheld hitherto from receiving pay from his Pari&s;h only by my interference: Were my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, therefore, withdrawn, if not otherwi&s;e provided for, he mu&s;t be re|turned to the Pari&s;h to which he belongs. <Q>Now as it will be fully proved in the fol|lowing pages, that a weekly payment of eight &s;hillings does and mu&s;t operate to the utter exclu&s;ion of Pari&s;h Paupers from the A&s;ylum, a plan which &s;ets out with recom|mending &startq;that at <HI>no time</HI> the payments &endq;from the Pari&s;h Poor &s;hould be reduced" demands, &s;urely, a more pointed animad|ver&s;ion than I have given it:</Q></P>
<P>For, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that this unhappy youth &s;hould be returned to his pari&s;h, the probability is, that they will never be willing to maintain him as I now do, but
<PB N="vii" REF="5">
will in&s;tantly try a cheaper experiment: they will take him home to &s;ee how he will there behave him&s;elf, and, on the very fir&s;t &s;ign of dangerous phren&s;y which he may &s;hew, condemn him to a chain in &s;ome mi&s;erable hut for the remainder of his days, which, from his pre&s;ent &s;trength of con&s;titution, may, perhaps, be prolonged to half a century.</P>
<P>What impre&s;&s;es this fear on my own mind, is a trial which I was advi&s;ed to make of the &s;tate of his intellect, about a year after he had been in the A&s;ylum: I was then told that he was &s;o far recovered that he might be tru&s;ted in a country village without a &s;pecial keeper, where air and working exer|ci&s;e might compleat his cure. With this hope I removed him into a private fami|ly near York, where, though for a few weeks he behaved him&s;elf quietly and coolly, yet in the end, his in&s;anity return|ing, he was near killing a young child, to whom he had before &s;hewn great tender|ne&s;s and affection. This, as may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed, determined me to order him immediately back to the Ho&s;pital, where he has &s;ince remained; and where, though his weekly pay has been lowered from eight to &s;ix &s;hillings, yet I think it nece&s;&s;ary to aver that it has been lowered without any &s;olicitation on my part, becau&s;e I have
<PB N="viii" REF="6">
never wi&s;hed that any partial diminution &s;hould be made in my favour; it having been long my &s;ettled opinion, <Q>&startq;That as the charitable fund increa&s;ed, all Poor Patients <HI>of every denomination</HI> &s;hould be <HI>equally</HI> relieved by it, in that general proportion which the finances of the &endq;charity would bear:</Q> To &s;upport this principle and another, which like it has the appearance of an axiom, viz. <Q>&startq;That the <HI>original intention</HI> of the &s;ub&s;cribers to any charitable in&s;titution <HI>ought reli|giou&s;ly &endq;to be adhered to,</HI> are the two capital points aimed at in this publication:</Q> In which, I tru&s;t, I have oppo&s;ed very dif|ferent principles, in the way of fair and liberal controver&s;y. I am aware that the formal mode of propo&s;itions which I have adopted may lay me under the imputation of being prolix and tedious, yet I &s;hall chearfully &s;ubmit to any thing that may lower my reputation as a Writer, if, as a Man, I prove my&s;elf to be, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this &s;ubject, a Friend to the Poor and to him that has no Helper.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>TO relieve Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers was a primary intention of the nobility, gentry, and others; and one of their principal motives for entering into a &s;ub&s;cription for erecting a Lunatic A&s;ylum at York.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The proof of this propo&s;ition will readily re&s;ult from the very words of the adverti&s;e|ment which fir&s;t called a meeting for the above Purpo&s;e: It is dated York, Augu&s;t 7, 1772; and begins thus: <Q>&startq;Sen&s;ible of the deplorable &s;ituation of many poor Lunatics, in this ex|ten&s;ive county, who have no other &s;upport but what a needy parent can be&s;tow, or a thrifty pari&s;h-officer provide, we do, there|fore, recommend to the public in general, a &s;ub&s;cription towards erecting a public Edifice &endq;for the reception of &s;uch unhappy people.</Q></P>
<P>After the gentlemen had met, a &s;econd paper was publi&s;hed, entitled <HI>Rea&s;ons for the e&s;tabli&s;hing a Lunatic Ho&s;pital</HI>, dated the 25th of the &s;ame month and year. In which the above rea&s;on was &s;till more forcibly expre&s;&s;ed, and placed at the head of &s;even others, in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;1&s;t. It is well known that no particular provi&s;ion is made by law for Lunatics; the common Pari&s;h Work-Hou&s;es, and Hou&s;es of Correction, being no ways proper for their
<PB N="2" REF="8">
reception, either in point of accommoda|tion, &endq;attendance, or medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> It is unnece&s;&s;ary to make any farther ob&s;ervations on the&s;e two fundamental and declaratory rea|&s;ons for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an ho&s;pital, than that they were immediately taken from tho&s;e which the gentlemen of Manche&s;ter had before adopted on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion, though only in part;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>The Manche&s;ter Account humanely urges an additional rea|&s;on, that &startq;of de&s;iring to prevent them from continuing public &endq;&s;pectacles of the deepe&s;t mi&s;ery:</Q> <Q>And al&s;o declares &startq;that the Phy&s;icians of the Infirmary, and the Surgeons when nece&s;&s;ary, &endq;have generou&s;ly offered to give their attendance CRATIS.</Q></NOTE> and that they fully e&s;tabli&s;h the truth of this fir&s;t propo&s;ition.</P>
<P>Yet, le&s;t I &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected of withholding any other rea&s;on from the eye of the public, at pre&s;ent, which was held out to them at the fir&s;t, I am ready here to &s;tate the only two <HI>rea&s;ons</HI> which can, in any &s;ort, be put in competition with tho&s;e which I have adduced: <Q>The&s;e then are the 6th and 8th in that paper, the former of which declares &startq;that many families (in no mean cir|cum&s;tances) through the heavy expence at|tending the &s;upport of one object of this &s;ort, have them&s;elves become the object of charitable relief, and, thereby, doubled the load and lo&s;s &endq;to the public; and the latter, that &startq;the la&s;t, but not the lea&s;t con&s;ideration with the pro|moters of this de&s;ign is, the a&s;&s;i&s;tance that may be given to many per&s;ons of <HI>mode|rate circum&s;tances</HI>, who, labouring under the misfortune of an un&s;ound mind, have no place to retire to but a private madhou&s;e, where their cure &s;tands a great chance of being protracted for the benefit of the
<PB N="3" REF="9">
mercenary keeper, if ever to be accompli&s;hed under the care of one who can lay &s;o &s;mall a claim to medical abilities. Tho&s;e per&s;ons or their relations, it is to be hoped, would gladly give the preference to an A&s;ylum under the direction of men of principles and honour, where the patients might expect to meet with the mo&s;t humane and di&s;intere&s;ted treatment; and where they might have a chance of being re&s;tored to their health and &endq;friends, without impairing their fortunes.</Q></P>
<P><Q>The&s;e al&s;o were copied from the Manche&s;ter account, but in that was added, &startq;that in the&s;e ca&s;es, a moderate fee was to be taken by the tru&s;tees for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and phy&s;ician &endq;for his advice.</Q> This omi&s;&s;ion, however, was made up for, in a third publication, in a manner, which the per&s;on who drew it up might imagine the public would, at the time, think even more di&s;intere&s;ted, viz. <Q>&startq;And here it will be proper to remark, that no attending phy&s;ician or &s;urgeon will receive either &s;ee or reward, as long as the ho&s;pital continues to receive only paupers or per&s;ons in low and indigent circum&s;tances, agreeable to the ORI|GINAL &endq;DESIGN of this charity.</Q></P>
<P>The publication, whence this paragraph is taken, is intitled, <HI>An earne&s;t Application to the Humane Public, concerning the pre&s;ent State of the A&s;ylum, erected near York for the Reception of Lu|natics</HI>. It is dated May 3, 1777, at a time when the building was fini&s;hed and &s;itted up to receive patients. <Q>It recapitulates all the former rea&s;ons, and declares the intention of the charity to be that &startq;of alleviating the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of Lunatics, as well as to remove a
<PB N="4" REF="10">
heavy and expen&s;ive burthen from their &endq;pari&s;hes or families.</Q> <Q>From all this, and from the words of the late Lord Archbi&s;hop of York, who fir&s;t opened the &s;ub&s;cription for erecting a &s;uitable building for the reception of Lunatics, &startq;being either PARISH POOR or be|longing &endq;to di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and indigent families," I may, I think, &s;afely affirm, that this propo&s;ition is demon&s;trated.</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION II.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The original Intention of the &s;ub&s;cribers to that charity, as already &s;pecified, is a laudable one.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>This has &s;o glaringly the appearance of an axiom, that I am afraid the generality of my readers will pa&s;s it over as an unque&s;tionable truth, and not trouble them&s;elves to read what I have to urge in its proof, which I much wi&s;h them to do, becau&s;e much has previou&s;ly been written to make it appear ab&s;urd. Among&s;t other things it has been declared <Q>&startq;That to reduce the payments made by pari&s;hes, for their in&s;ane poor, would open a door for all the idiots, bedridden, di&s;ea&s;ed, and incurable &endq;mad paupers in the kingdom.</Q> <Q>It has been al&s;o &s;aid, that, by &s;o doing, &startq;the hou&s;e would be immediately filled with the lowe&s;t and &endq;meane&s;t of the poor.</Q> It is, therefore, ab|&s;olutely incumbent on me, in this place, to vin|dicate, for the credit of my&s;elf, and the re&s;t of my
<PB N="5" REF="11">
original &s;ub&s;cribing brethren, that motive which induced us to &s;ub&s;cribe to this charity, and to deny that per&s;ons of middling rank and in low circum&s;tances were tho&s;e for whom the A&s;y|lum was PRINCIPALLY intended, however its government may have been hitherto, or may be in future planned. We were all taught to believe, and I may &s;urely an&s;wer for one, that all Lunatic Paupers, as being afflicted with this deplorable malady in common, were all equally objects of our benevolence; and the form of the in&s;ti|tution, as already exhibited, intimates no dif|ference among them. <HI>See Prop.</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s is with <HI>Pari&s;h Luna|tics</HI>, and my pre&s;ent proof mu&s;t refer only to their &s;eparate ca&s;e; which was humanely con|&s;idered, as has been &s;hewn already, to be mo&s;t truely deplorable, becau&s;e, 1&s;t. There was no &s;pecific law for them; 2d. No other &s;upport than what a thrifty pari&s;h-officer could pro|vide; 3d. No better place (&s;uppo&s;ing the of|ficer not thrifty) than a common Workhou&s;e or Hou&s;e of Correction; no proper means of accommodation, attendance, or medical a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance; and that, therefore, an ho&s;pital found|ed with a view to &s;upply the&s;e wants, would be the be&s;t means of relieving the&s;e peculi|arly pitiable objects.</P>
<P>I beg pardon for this tedious recapitulation, which I u&s;e only for the &s;ake of pre&s;&s;ing the motive home to the peculiar ca&s;e of the&s;e identical paupers. Unle&s;s, therefore, &s;ome other mode of relief for them can be point|ed out, as good or better than that of an ho&s;pital, I hold the <HI>laudable</HI> intention of the &s;ub&s;cribers to be fully proved.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="proposition">
<PB N="6" REF="12">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION III.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>To relieve pari&s;hes from the heavy and ex|pen&s;ive burthen of maintaining their own <HI>Lu|natic</HI> Poor is defen&s;ible.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>The incapacity of Pari&s;hes to relieve their Lunatic Poor having been thus proved, this &s;eems al&s;o to require little di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and I &s;hall only remark upon it, That on the &s;up|po&s;ition that a gentleman who originally &s;ub|&s;cribed to this charity, might have put the ca&s;e of the Lunatics them&s;elves entirely out of his con&s;ideration, and, having landed property, thought he did well in promoting a &s;ub&s;crip|tion for an ho&s;pital, which might be a means of lowering the poor rates of that pari&s;h where this property lay, he cannot be arraigned of a want of prudence, or even of genero&s;ity, in &s;o doing. For the expence of maintaining a Pari&s;h Lunatic, mu&s;t frequently, if not con&s;tantly, be much greater than that of maintaining an idiot, bedridden, di&s;ea&s;ed, or incurable pari&s;h pauper, not afflicted with this additional malady: Such as, perhaps, the building of a particular cell, the con&s;tant attendance of a keeper, &amp;c. &amp;c. all which being to be provided in a better manner, and at a &s;maller expence in an ho&s;pital, particularly &s;upported for that purpo&s;e, might induce the gentleman, with great propriety, to &s;ub&s;cribe to &s;uch charity, though he had no farther motives for doing &s;o than tho&s;e which I have &s;uppo&s;ed: <Q>And, if he really had no other than the&s;e, which have been in|&s;inuated
<PB N="7" REF="13">
to be &s;o &s;elfi&s;h &startq;as that the charitable &endq;&s;pirit of a man mu&s;t revolt at them, yet, he will, perhaps, be the fir&s;t to condemn, and with ju&s;tice too, the proceedings of any indi|vidual, or body of men, who, acting under the &s;hadow of a committee or general meeting, may promote, or even connive at, proceedings which tend to make the purpo&s;e for which he originally &s;ub&s;cribed to the charity inefficaci|ous.</Q> And, if &s;uch a man be the fir&s;t, the re&s;t of the &s;ub&s;cribers ought, in ju&s;tice, to join him in condemning any per&s;on or per&s;ons whatever, who have prevented his charity from going in the channel, in which, in the fir&s;t rea&s;on given for founding the ho&s;pital, he was a&s;&s;ured it &s;hould go, whatever might be his motive for &s;ub&s;cribing to it. He paid, indeed, his money for the relief of his pari&s;h, and not for the re|lief of their Lunatic Pauper, but, knowing that the Lunatic mu&s;t be relieved, the peculiar pari&s;h burthens, incurred in the ca&s;e of Lunatic Paupers, led him to do it; and tho&s;e expen&s;ive burthens ju&s;tify him in &s;o doing. I am ready to admit that this rea&s;on is not &s;o laudable as that before mentioned: Yet it is a rea&s;on which generally operates with the Sub&s;cribers to Coun|ty Infirmaries, e&s;pecially when they live near to the city or town where &s;uch Infirmary is &s;itua|ted; and I never have heard it called blameable. Pari&s;hes al&s;o, in a body, by their Over&s;eers, Friendly Societies, and Town&s;hips are frequent|ly &s;ub&s;cribers to &s;uch in&s;titutions. A con&s;ider|ation, this, which I would wi&s;h the Reader to keep in view, as it tends to &s;hew, that none of the&s;e charitable foundations have ever thought of adopting that di&s;tinction, which the York
<PB N="8" REF="14">
Lunatic A&s;ylum has, relative to parochial and other poor patients. Though not &s;o laudable, therefore, his action is at the lea&s;t defen&s;ible.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="proposition">
<HEAD>PROPOSITION IV.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>The opinion that <HI>Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers</HI> are <HI>LESS</HI> the object of the public charity of an A&s;ylum than any other Lunatic Paupers, is fallacious.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>This being the propo&s;ition to &s;upport which the former were chiefly adduced and proved, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to enlarge &s;omewhat more upon it.</P>
<P>There is no fallacy &s;o difficult of detection as that which has interwoven it&s;elf, for a length of time, with a generally received truth. Yet, like ivy, mi&s;&s;eltoe, or any other <HI>para&s;itical</HI> plant, as the botani&s;ts call them, if it can be lopped off from the &s;tem it creeps about or roots it&s;elf in, that &s;tem will be likely to thrive the better for the &s;eparation. I &s;hall proceed, therefore, here to &s;eparate this opinion from that truth with which it has been entangled, and prove it fallacious in the following man|ner:</P>
<P>The inefficacy of attempting to relieve com|mon Pari&s;h Paupers, either by beque&s;t or other &s;imilar gifts, I admit in general as a truth.</P>
<P>The inefficacy of attempting a like relief to Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers, I deny as a fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I admit the fir&s;t as a <HI>general</HI> truth is, that to relieve the common Pari&s;h Pau|pers,
<PB N="9" REF="15">
is to relieve the more opulent men of the pari&s;h, and to reduce their poor rates without e&s;&s;entially a&s;&s;i&s;ting the indigent individuals them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The rea&s;on why I deny the &s;econd as a fal&s;|hood, is that the fir&s;t, &s;econd, and even third Propo&s;itions prove the deplorable &s;tate of the Lunatic poor of a pari&s;h to be very di&s;&s;imilar to the other, and that, therefore, the inefficacy of attempting to relieve them is a fal&s;hood, which, though interwoven with a truth, ought to be carefully &s;eparated from it. The defenders of this fallacy may, if they plea&s;e, accept of the fol|lowing &s;yllogi&s;m for their defence till they can frame a better:
<Q><L>To relieve Pari&s;h Paupers is to relieve Pari&s;hes:</L>
<L>But Pari&s;h Paupers may be Lunatics:</L>
<L>Therefore, to relieve Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers, is to relieve Pari&s;hes.</L></Q></P>
<P>To which I will only oppo&s;e the authority of the original in&s;titution, which &s;ays, that Pari&s;h Paupers who are Lunatics ought to be relieved, becau&s;e a thrifty pari&s;h-officer cannot relieve them properly;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See fir&s;t adverti&s;ement in the fir&s;t Propo&s;ition.</NOTE> and that in as much as there is no better receptacle for them than a Pari&s;h Workhou&s;e or Hou&s;e of Correction, where their treatment mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be improper, an Ho&s;pital &s;hall therefore be built by &s;ub&s;cription, for the reception of &s;uch unhappy people. Is this then no relief to Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers, or in relieving them, is it only a relief to their re|&s;pective Pari&s;hes?</P>
<P>On thus confronting the arguments, the ab|&s;urdity of affirming that to relieve Pari&s;h Pau|pers is <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> to relieve Pari&s;hes <HI>only</HI> will
<PB N="10" REF="16">
clearly appear. But as the defender or abettors of this error, will not ea&s;ily be put to &s;ilence by confutation, it will be replied to me, that, if you have proved Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers proper objects of this charity, you have not proved them to be more &s;o than per&s;ons of low and indigent circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>My fir&s;t an&s;wer to this is, that the Propo&s;i|tion does not go &s;o far.</P>
<P>My &s;econd, that, if it did, it would be capable of proof; and this, from the much wor&s;e &s;itua|tion of a Lunatic Pari&s;h Pauper than that of a common Lunatic, which is already proved;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;ition 1 and 2.</NOTE> for is not &s;uch a deplorable object likely to be taken more tender care of by a needy parent than a thrifty pari&s;h-officer? Are not even the poore&s;t cottages more likely to afford him a quiet re&s;idence than a public Workhou&s;e or Hou&s;e of Correction? Where Lunacy is con|cerned, it is the ca&s;e of the individual Lunatic, and not of the pari&s;h-officer or parent, that is the object of the charity.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Propo&s;ition 2.</NOTE> Let the pari&s;h or parent be unable to maintain him, the one for want of proper accommodation, the other for want of pecuniary a&s;&s;i&s;tance; is he le&s;s a Lunatic on either &s;uppo&s;ition? <Q>Am I a&s;ked then &startq;are per&s;ons in low and indigent circum|&s;tances, who have a Lunatic to maintain, not to be preferred in this charity before pari&s;hes &endq;in the &s;ame &s;ituation?</Q> I an&s;wer, No! be|cau&s;e the care that pari&s;hes can give to &s;uch an object is as inadequate to his accommodation, maintenance and cure, as the care of relations, indigent and in low circum&s;tances.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Propo&s;ition 1, or rather the original adverti&s;ement, where Lunatics, as Lunatics, whether they receive pay from the pari&s;h or not, are &s;tated as they &s;hould be in a &s;tate of equality.</NOTE> Were

Pari&s;hes under a legal nece&s;&s;ity to relieve their Lunatic Paupers to the extent of their wants, to afford them medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and other &s;uitable accommodations, in this ca&s;e the re|ver&s;e might po&s;&s;ibly be the truth; but at pre|&s;ent, unle&s;s their Lunacy extend to outrage and danger, their Pari&s;hes are under no obliga|tion to maintain them but as ordinary Paupers. Surely I am now relea&s;ed from the trouble of u&s;ing more words to prove this Propo&s;ition true.</P>

But is this a difference wor|thy of con&s;ideration? Let tho&s;e who think &s;o, re|turn back to the 3d Propo&s;ition: To prove this
<PB N="18" REF="24">
&s;till more fully, I will produce the following fact:</P>
<P>It was &s;aid in a late vindication of the plan before quoted, that the wife of a poor Curate &s;tands now on the A&s;ylum books, at the weekly pay of four &s;hillings. My reflection on fir&s;t reading this, was, that I would wi&s;h it were le&s;s, and I have &s;ince found that &s;ome other per&s;ons have not only reflected, but acted on that reflection. I meant to have done &s;o too, but fir&s;t thought it prudent to &s;end to Mr. Ea&s;tburn the Secretary, to know the name and circum|&s;tances of this poor Curate. The name was given me, and for the circum&s;tances I was re|ferred to a very re&s;pectable Clergyman in York, by whom the payments for the patient in que&s;tion, were regularly and quarterly paid. He gave me an excellent character of the hu&s;|band, but could not as a certainty tell me, whe|ther he was in any manner a&s;&s;i&s;ted on this oc|ca&s;ion. As that was the principal point to which my enquiries tended, I de&s;ired him to write to him for the purpo&s;e. He did &s;o immediately, and from his an&s;wer which I have lately &s;een, and which in the plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t manner exhibits his poverty, gratitude, good &s;en&s;e, and humanity, I learn that he has been for <HI>the mo&s;t part</HI>, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the gentlemen, &amp;c. of his neigh|bourhood, in Hamp&s;hire; that of their cha|rity he has now ten pounds in bank, for the maintenance of his wife, and that having &s;ome expectation next &s;ummer of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a lit|tle e&s;tate of about 20l. per annum, he hopes to be able to bear the expence him&s;elf; he re|turns<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Propo&s;ition.</NOTE>

his &s;incere&s;t thanks to the <HI>Governors</HI> of the A&s;ylum, for the indulgence <HI>they</HI> have &s;hewn him, in taking off another weekly &s;hilling in <HI>their</HI> la&s;t quarterly bill, which I find is dated York, January 14, 1788, ju&s;t nine days after the Phy&s;ician had made this charitable indulgence of the Governors, for the &s;upport of his own cau&s;e, fir&s;t public. An anecdote which to the attentive reader, may perhaps &s;eem &s;omewhat remarkable.</P>
<P>But to apply this ca&s;e to the proof of the Pro|po&s;ition, which can only be done by compari&s;on, I allow it to be truly pitiable, and whether by contribution, or otherwi&s;e, worthy of relief; but is that of the Pari&s;h Lunatic le&s;s &s;o? the Curate's wife and this other per&s;on are both Lunatics; neither of them can be &s;upported but by greater benevolence than the pari&s;h will &s;hew or the Curate can provide, and both are actually &s;up|ported for the mo&s;t part by &s;uch benevolence. The per&s;ons who contribute are in affluent cir|cum&s;tances, both in the real, and the &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, neither the Curate or the Pari&s;h are &s;o burthened as to exclude the patients:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My Orphan Lunatic, mentioned in the preface, is a ca&s;e &s;trictly &s;imilar.</NOTE> The weekly pay, therefore, of the&s;e differently de|nominated Lunatics, ought to be preci&s;ely the &s;ame.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It may po&s;&s;ibly be objected, that the &s;tate of the Pari&s;h Lu|natic is preferable to that of the Individual in low and indigent Circum&s;tances, ina&s;much as the pari&s;h is compelled by law to contribute to his <HI>maintenance</HI>, though not in &s;uch a manner as to &s;ecure the benefit of attendance and medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;uitable to his peculiarly unhappy &s;ituation; whereas the individual may find it difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to rai&s;e a weekly &s;um equal to what is allowed by the pari&s;h officer, and, con&s;equently, require a greater contribution from the truly humane than the former: To which I an&s;wer, that although it po&s;&s;ibly may be true in &s;ome &s;ew in&s;tances, yet it is not &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h of it&s;elf a general rule; but I wi&s;h the reader to have recour&s;e to what was admit|ted as a general truth in Propo&s;ition 4, and he will there find, that the pro&s;pect of the <HI>Pari&s;h</HI> Pauper, merely as &s;uch, receiving additional contributions, is very &s;mall indeed, when compared with that of the individual unrelieved by any Pari&s;h.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="26">Having now brought my proofs to &s;uch a point as determines the di&s;tinction that has been made between Lunatic Pari&s;h Paupers and other Lu|natic Poor, to be wor&s;e than nugatory, becau&s;e &s;ubver&s;ive of the original intention of the cha|rity, I might here drop the pen, which has done all that I pledged my&s;elf to the public it &s;hould do; e&s;pecially as I am even now not without &s;ome glimp&s;e of hope, that, if the Governors (who, it is &s;aid, at the next general meeting, are to determine on this important matter) do me the honour to give what I have already written, a previous reading, they will not, as matter of mere compliment afford the Phy&s;ician's projected Plan, &s;o far at lea&s;t as Pari&s;h Lunatics are concerned in it, their hearty &s;anc|tion. Yet, as I am well aware that many &s;pecious arguments have been, and may be again brought forward to vindicate the mea&s;ure; I have, in my own mind, weighed their nature and tendency, and think they may all be re|duced to three kinds: 1.

<PB N="21" REF="27">
and this to avoid all future trouble of replica|tion and rejoinder.</P>
<P N="1">1. As an argument from Precedent, it has been &s;aid in a new&s;paper paragraph, <Q>&startq;A cor|re&s;pondent, who has lately vi&s;ited St. Luke's Ho&s;pital in London, informs us, that no Patients are there kept longer than one year; after which, if not cured, they are either turned out, or put upon the incurable fund, at five &s;hillings per week, where they are kept during life. By a late regulation of that charity, pari&s;h poor are not permitted to re|ceive, as formerly, the benefit of the incurable fund, it being now the intention of the Governors to be&s;tow it only upon tho&s;e who are in low circum&s;tances, and who pay for them&s;elves. Our corre&s;pondent calls this a &endq;<HI>&s;en&s;ible</HI> and humane alteration.</Q></P>
<P>Here, then, we &s;ee the pre&s;ent government of St. Luke's Ho&s;pital produced as an argument again&s;t what, it was &s;u&s;pected might be &s;aid, ought to be the government of the York Lunatic Ho&s;pital. But to give any rational efficacy to this and every other argument of the kind, it mu&s;t be fir&s;t &s;hewn, that the in&s;titutions intend|ed to be brought into competition are preci&s;ely &s;imilar; and even if this can be done, what will be the re&s;ult? Will any of the foregoing Pro|po&s;itions be the le&s;s true, becau&s;e any other Ho&s;pi|tal or Ho&s;pitals have acted on different princi|ples? And, in &s;aying this, I do not think that I impeach the &s;agacity by which any of the&s;e Ho&s;pitals is governed. I can ea&s;ily conceive, though I cannot point them out, many di&s;cri|minations that may ari&s;e from &s;ituation, in&s;ti|tution, finances, and even charter. All that I pretend to know is, the original in&s;titution of

the York Ho&s;pital, founded by &s;ub&s;cription; to that only my rea&s;onings are meant to apply, and I am convinced, that no arguments, drawn from the precedents of other Ho&s;pitals, can in any &s;ort affect their application.

<P N="2">2. But arguments drawn from Nece&s;&s;ity re|quire a different treatment, and &s;hall have a more minute con&s;ideration. They mu&s;t, how|ever, on this &s;ubject, nece&s;&s;arily have their foundation on one, ever to be condemned, Error <HI>in principio</HI>, I mean that inordinate Wa&s;te of the Public Money, which was incurred by the purcha&s;e of the ground, and that &s;till more enormous expence of the Edifice it&s;elf, in which &s;plendour and o&s;tentation were aimed at, where convenience and privacy ought only to have been con&s;ulted; and a man&s;ion, which, out of compa&s;&s;ion to the unhappy inmates and their friends, ought to have been veiled by a per|petual &s;hade, was taught to perk it&s;elf up with all the effrontery of the villa of a Nabob.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ituation cho&s;en was &s;till more objectionable than any other of tho&s;e original errors.

Proximity of place was &s;urely devoutly to be wi&s;hed, with regard to the two buildings; when Phy&s;icians and Surgeons (I write, according to the original notion, in the plural number) who had, from the fir&s;t opening of the Infirmary, attended there <HI>gratis</HI>, might rea&s;onably be expected to give the Lunatic Ho&s;pital the &s;ame gratuitous at|tention: The pre&s;ent great and inconvenient di&s;tance of the Ho&s;pitals mu&s;t ever be &s;ome ob&s;tacle to this, and, we know, it was particularly &s;o at the fir&s;t; for when the pre&s;ent Phy&s;ician took it under his immediate direction, he found it convenient to withdraw his medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Infirmary, by which that charity &s;u&s;tained a lo&s;s which it has &s;till to deplore.</NOTE> For
<PB N="23" REF="29">
this goodly purpo&s;e the original &s;ub&s;cription, which was no le&s;s than 5690l. was &s;o far exhau&s;t|ed, that the fund was not then able to fini&s;h and furni&s;h the hou&s;e within, which it had made &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily pompous without. This, how|ever, &s;upplies Nece&s;&s;ity with her fir&s;t argument, and affords her premi&s;es on which &s;he may argue very ju&s;tly, that it was impo&s;&s;ible, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, for the Governors to admit any, even the poore&s;t patients, without a week|ly payment, which might &s;ufficiently maintain them. To this the &s;ub&s;cribers &s;ilently a&s;&s;ented, and however indignant many of them might ju&s;t|ly have been at the wretched wa&s;te of their &s;ub|&s;cription money, yet, finding the evil without im|mediate redre&s;s, they waited patiently till fre&s;h contributions &s;hould come in, either by legacy or donation, which might furni&s;h &s;uch a fund as would make the building not, what it was now, a place of Lodging and Boarding, but an <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> in the ju&s;t and u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the term; an Ho&s;pital, &s;o far as its circum&s;tances would ad|mit, &s;uch as the County Infirmary had for years been, where patients were, except a &s;mall de|po&s;it in ca&s;e of burial, admitted <HI>gratis</HI>, and where Phy&s;icians and Surgeons al&s;o attended <HI>gratis</HI>. Nor was the pre&s;s idle in flattering them into &s;uch a future hope, though at the &s;ame time it tacitly (if the pre&s;s can ever be &s;aid to do any|thing tacitly) laid a foundation for that very different Thing from an Ho&s;pital, to which the building was, when matters were ripe for it, in|tended to be metamorpho&s;ed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Propo&s;ition 1.</NOTE> For this purpo&s;e it was &s;aid in the account publi&s;hed May 1777, as a matter proper to remark, <Q>&startq;That no Phy&s;i|cian or Surgeon will receive either &s;ee or re|ward,

<P>I allow it to be very true that the Ho&s;pital could not admit patients at the time &s;pecified without making them pay not only for their board, lodging, and wa&s;hing, but even for their very medicines.

other than a fund (a precarious one indeed!) for the relief of the indigent? Yet precarious as it may be, it is even now deemed &s;ufficient (if only tho&s;e reasonable fees which the Phy&s;ician has been reque&s;ted to receive, be added to it) not only to pay two annual &s;alaries, amounting in the whole to three hundred pounds, but al&s;o &s;uf|ficient to relieve all indigent paupers, that are at pre&s;ent, or may in future become objects of the charity, Pari&s;h Lunatics always only ex|cepted. How different from this doctrine is that which was held out only five years ago in an adverti&s;ement prefixed to a &s;ermon preached for the benefit of the charity, by a relation of the Phy&s;ician's, and who can hardly be &s;up|po&s;ed to have written it him&s;elf, or have print|ed it without the Phy&s;ician's immediate appro|bation.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A &s;ermon preached in 1782, at St. Michael Le Belfrey, by the Rev.

This re&s;pectable old man had, for many years before, been in that way of bu&s;ine&s;s; he had &s;een much of the practice of Bethlehem Ho&s;pital, had acted under Dr. Monro, and was po&s;&s;e&s;t of many of his pre&s;criptions, and for his com|petent &s;kill, at lea&s;t in common ca&s;es, and &s;till more for his great care and humanity, was patronized by Dr. Dealtry him&s;elf, who con&s;tantly recommended him, when lunatic ca&s;es came before him, even to per&s;ons of condition. When the A&s;y|lum was nearly fini&s;hed, this man was con&s;ulted concerning it, and, after rectifying many mi&s;takes in the building, brought his own patients into it, and, relinqui&s;hing his own private hou&s;e, became principal manager, keeper, nay, and apothecary too (at lea&s;t occa&s;ionally) for the &s;mall annual &s;alary of 40l. Yet, at or about this very time, he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed; and how di&s;mi&s;&s;ed? With a pen&s;ion of 20l. per annum for life, and with leave to take with him &s;uch of his own patients as then remained in the hou&s;e. He is now in his 77th year, but in the full vigor of all his faculties, and except a natural diminution of bodily &s;trength, as competent to &s;uper|intend &s;uch an Ho&s;pital as ever. He &s;till, in the &s;uburbs of York, keeps a few patients, as many as his neat but &s;mall cottage will permit him to keep, and in the greate&s;t order and decency. Many remarks might be made on this anecdote, but I only pro|po&s;e this &s;ingle que&s;tion: Was his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion the be&s;t way of di&s;|couraging Private Madhou&s;es?</NOTE>

<P N="3">3. Turning now from the argument of Nece&s;&s;ity, I proceed to con&s;ider &s;ome of the pleas of Expe|diency. <Q>The following comes clearly under this de&s;cription, &startq;that to reduce the payment made by the pari&s;hes for their in&s;ane poor would open a door for the entrance of all the idiots, bedridden, di&s;ea&s;ed, and incurable mad pau|pers &endq;in the kingdom.</Q> It is, therefore, if true, certainly inexpedient that &s;uch a door &s;hould be opened. This argument, though before occa&s;ionally quoted, &s;hall now be more minute|ly
<PB N="29" REF="35">
con&s;idered; and as different de&s;criptions of per&s;ons are here enumerated, I &s;hall con&s;ider each in their order.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Idiots</HI>, as they are not mentioned as one of the original objects of this charity, may, for that very rea&s;on, be excluded from it. I have been told, indeed, that the expediency of their admi&s;&s;ion has been occa&s;ionally debated; but I enter not into &s;uch debate. I only intimate, as my own private &s;entiment, that could the&s;e very pitiable objects receive the benefit of this, or any other charitable place of reception, I would gladly, either by annual &s;ub&s;cription or otherwi&s;e, contribute towards their mainte|nance, in order that they might be removed from the public eye, and prevented from continuing &s;pectacles of the deepe&s;t mi&s;ery. The public &s;pirited Dean of St. Patrick's, we know founded an Ho&s;pital, for fools as well as mad, which has la&s;ted more than ten years thrice told without any deviation from its pri|mary in&s;titution: And were any additional building to the York A&s;ylum projected for the &s;eparate reception of Idiots, I am per&s;waded it would meet the wi&s;hes, and receive the dona|tions of many benevolent Chri&s;tians. For, tired as many of them may be, of contributing to &s;ome public charities on account of their ma|nifold perver&s;ions, yet they would reflect that a charity of this kind is le&s;s likely to be per|verted (in certain re&s;pects) than any other. For, as in the ca&s;e of Idiots, medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance cannot po&s;&s;ibly be much wanted, fees and &s;alaries to Phy&s;icians and Apothecaries can never be obtruded.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of <HI>Bedridden</HI> Pari&s;h Lunatics, I cannot &s;u&s;pect that many of them would be forced up|on
<PB N="30" REF="36">
the A&s;ylum, becau&s;e the very term implies&mdash; that they have lo&s;t either the power of motion, entirely, or &s;o nearly, as to be no very dangerous or improper inmates of a common Workhou&s;e. But &s;uppo&s;e the contrary, a &s;ingle re&s;olution, or order of the general meeting, provided it does not counteract the original intention, would effectually preclude even an attempt to &s;end them from neighbouring pari&s;hes; and is it to be be|lieved, that the expence of their journey would not of it&s;elf deter tho&s;e at a greater di&s;tance from making &s;o unprofitable an attempt?</P>
<P N="3">3. But where <HI>di&s;ea&s;e</HI>, either acute or chroni|cal, is &s;uperadded to &s;o deplorable a malady as Lunacy, I mu&s;t own I look upon this as a rea&s;on <HI>a fortiori</HI> for the admi&s;&s;ion of &s;uch peculiarly unhappy objects into every Lunatic Ho&s;pital: Nor can there be any conceivable rea&s;on again&s;t it, except in a ca&s;e where that Ho&s;pital may be under the &s;ole direction of a Phy&s;ician incapable of curing any other di&s;ea&s;e but Lunacy.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let me now con&s;ider the la&s;t &s;pecies of the&s;e de&s;perate invaders&mdash;the <HI>Incurable</HI> Mad Paupers. Here as the epithet <HI>Mad</HI> &s;eems to be put emphatically, I am at a lo&s;s to determine its preci&s;e &s;ignification. If it means incurable Lunacy without intervals, I have only to &s;up|po&s;e, that per&s;ons of &s;uperior condition, as well as ab&s;olute pari&s;h paupers, may be afflicted with the very &s;ame &s;tate of phrenzy, and therefore, in ju&s;tice, they ought both to be excluded equal|ly, which, I fear, may hereafter tend to make the newly invented fund &s;till more precarious.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays Expediency, it is from the num|bers, not the &s;pecies of Lunatics, coming from all parts of the kingdom that this danger is to be apprehended. My an&s;wer to this will be
<PB N="31" REF="37">
given merely by repeating what I have already &s;aid in the ca&s;e of Bedridden Patients. An or|der, as exigency may prompt, from the gene|ral meeting will effectually prevent this. Or|ders of this kind have already done matters full as peremptory and ab&s;olute: They have, contrary to the intent of the original &s;ub&s;cri|bers, opened the arms of the Ho&s;pital to em|brace more than the county of York, even every Lunatic in his Maje&s;ty's dominions;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>In the year 1777, at a general meeting of the &s;ub&s;cribers, it was, for the fir&s;t time, re&s;olved, that patients from other parts of the kingdom &s;hould be admi&s;&s;ible into the Ho&s;pital; this per|mi&s;&s;ion, however, was not without its limitations, for the order is &startq;that the A&s;ylum be deemed <HI>An E&s;tabli&s;hment for the County of York</HI>, with liberty to the Governors to admit patients from &endq;other counties or places, <HI>on extraordinary occa&s;ions.</HI></Q> A ma|nife&s;t preference is here re&s;erved to this county&mdash;Notwith&s;tand|ing which, the Pari&s;h Lunatics of the county of York are now obliged to &s;urrender <HI>their e&s;tabli&s;hm$nt</HI>, and give way to Luna|tics in low, and perhaps in affluent, circum&s;tances. It may not be ami&s;s in this place to ob&s;erve, that &s;o &s;oon as this <HI>limited</HI> order was made, the liberality of the A&s;ylum in opening its arms to re|ceive all the Lunatics in the Briti&s;h Empire was con&s;tantly boa&s;ted in every annual account of the State of the Ho&s;pital; but it has never till now been que&s;tioned whether the&s;e <HI>metaphorical</HI> arms mu&s;t not of nece&s;&s;ity be confined within tho&s;e <HI>unmetaphorical</HI> and &s;olid out walls of brick, which include the apartments within them. Will the&s;e dilate them&s;elves for a purpo&s;e of &s;uch magnitude? In other Ho&s;pitals, when all the apartments are filled, it is the u&s;ual, and, indeed, nece&s;&s;ary practice to refu&s;e new inmates till vacan|cies happen; and if the county of York be able to fill them with its own Lunatics, the occa&s;ion mu&s;t be very extraordinary, indeed, which &s;hould take from it the preference which this or|der gives.</NOTE> they have reque&s;ted the Phy&s;ician to take fees, before the weekly payment of the poorer patients were uniformly and effectually lowered;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I pre&s;ume to notice this, although the &s;ignature of an Arch|bi&s;hop is affixed to the order to which I allude. Yet when I con&s;ider that his Grace was not promoted to the &s;ee of York till five years after the fir&s;t propo&s;als for erecting the Ho&s;pital i&s;&s;ued, it is probable, that, when he &s;igned that order, he might not have had &s;o perfect a conception of the original in&s;titution of the charity, as I flatter my&s;elf he will have, if he does me the honour to glance his eye over the&s;e few Pages.</NOTE> nay, they

have appointed one Phy&s;ician in exclu&s;ion of all others, without ever conde&s;cending to en|quire whether the re&s;t of the York practi&s;ing Phy&s;icians would, as they have long done at the County Infirmary, attend the A&s;ylum <HI>gratis</HI>.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is only an inference from the &s;tate of the Ho&s;pital, and the claim of a &s;alary to <HI>the</HI> Phy&s;ician, whom we mu&s;t, therefore, &s;uppo&s;e to have &s;ome unpubli&s;hed appointment in his hands, for otherwi&s;e it is not to be imagined that he would in his plan a&s;&s;ume this exclu&s;ive character. <Q>In March, 1774, the general meeting appointed a committee, to con&s;i&s;t of &s;ub&s;cribers of 20l. &startq;together &endq;with the practi&s;ing Phy&s;icians in York, and to that very meeting a &s;cheme, for the Conduct of the Ho&s;pital, was returned under the &s;ignatures of Dr. Hunter, Dr. Swain&s;ton, Dr. Withers, and the late Dr. Wallis:</Q> Salaries are there recommended, under the name of Wages to the Servants of the Ho&s;pital; and for the hou&s;e Apothecary, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of fifty-four patients at 6s. per week, the annual &s;um of 50l. is deemed &s;ufficient, but no &s;yllable appears re&s;pecting <HI>the</HI> Phy&s;ician's Wages, nor have we been able &s;ince to find any authorized di&s;mi&s;&s;al of the other prac|ti&s;ing Phy&s;icians from their gratuitous attendance upon the un|happy inmates of this <HI>quondam</HI> charity.</NOTE> This, &s;urely, is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy Expediency on this plea.</P>
<P>But &s;he will not be &s;atisfied &s;o ea&s;ily; &s;he has a certain argument &s;till in re&s;erve, which I will venture to bring forward; but without chu&s;ing to confute it: <Q>It is this, &startq;the too ge|neral admittance of the meane&s;t of mankind will be the &s;tronge&s;t ob&s;tacle to the frequent admittance of per&s;ons of &s;uperior condition, from whom only the fund for &s;alaries is to be &endq;expected.</Q> People of &s;uperior condition, when &s;ane, we know, are not very fond of mixing with their inferiors&mdash;in&s;anity, indeed, may po&s;&s;ibly take away the power of making the di&s;tinction; but putting them&s;elves out of the que&s;tion, their friends and relations, who mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;ons of &s;uperior con|dition, will probably have an equal reluctancy. And, I own, &s;ince I fir&s;t became acquainted
<PB N="33" REF="39">
with the change made in 1774, tending to the admi&s;&s;ion of affluent patients, I have fre|quently thought that the name of A&s;ylum came too near to the idea of an Ho&s;pital, to make it well reli&s;hed by per&s;ons of &s;uperior condition, and, therefore, have thought that now it ought to have a new appellative, and be denominated
<Q>THE LUNATIC HOTEL;</Q>
which would effectually remove all prejudices of that kind: Yet I humbly &s;ubmit the idea to tho&s;e whom it may mo&s;t concern. For my|&s;elf, I am perfectly convinced, that unle&s;s this argument be permitted to operate in its full extent, and to the utter exclu&s;ion of Pari&s;h Paupers, no certain &s;alary <HI>in perpetuo</HI> can be &s;ecured to the Phy&s;ician's &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, for whom and for whom &s;olely, I am convinced he has relinqui&s;hed his fees for one whole year, and thrown them into the general fund, by way of Experiment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The fees from the poor are di&s;avowed, and there is no ground to believe the Governors ever meant the Phy&s;ician to have them; from whom, then, are they to ari&s;e? from the rich inmates of an Ho&s;pital!

cau&s;e a decrea&s;e in the number of affluent pa|tients; and when I further con&s;ider that this &s;ucce&s;&s;or, on account of that con&s;iderable &s;alary annexed to his office, cannot be nominated with|out a previous election, it is to be &s;u&s;pected, that the ideas of Whig and Tory, or &s;ome &s;imilar party di&s;tinctions at the time, may operate more on the minds of the electors with re&s;pect to the qualifications of the &s;everal candidates than medical &s;kill and antimaniacal &s;cience. The con&s;equence then, mu&s;t certainly be, that, af|fluent patients becoming le&s;s numerous, the fund, in a few years, will become too &s;mall to pay even the Apothecary's pen&s;ion, much le&s;s that of the Phy&s;ician. If, then, that Phy&s;ician be not either able or willing to make a &s;acrifice of his &s;alary, the poorer &s;pecies of Lunatics (if, at the time, any &s;hould be found in the Place) mu&s;t be lo&s;t to all medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>On this account, I am inclined to agree in opinion with one of Dr. Hunter's re&s;pectable corre&s;pondents &startq;that in&s;tead of the intended new erection, and in lieu of &s;alary for the Phy&s;ician, &endq;a &s;mall hou&s;e  (I would rather have it a large one) &startq;&s;hould be built for the reception of a few patients of better condition.

<P>Suppo&s;e then, my impartial and unprejudiced reader! that when that original adverti&s;ement was drawn up, which has been quoted in my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, one in the following terms had been publi&s;hed in its &s;tead.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="advertisement">
<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Sen&s;ible that per&s;ons in affluent circum&s;tances and of &s;uperior condition might keep their relations or friends, who have the misfortune to be di&s;ordered in their &s;en&s;es, at a much cheaper rate than they can now do in any place of private confinement in the king|dom; we, the Nobility, Gentry, and Clergy of the county of York, propo&s;e to enter into a voluntary &s;ub|&s;cription towards erecting a very elegant building for that purpo&s;e, and to furni&s;h and fit up the &s;ame in the mo&s;t commodious manner, not only for them&s;elves, but their &s;ervants, where, under the care of an experienced &s;alaried Phy&s;ician, a man of principles and honour they will be &s;ure of the be&s;t medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and the mo&s;t polite and humane treatment, &s;uitable to their rank and condition. And we further propo&s;e, that after the ground is bought and the building erected, the re&s;idue of the &s;ub&s;cription money &s;hall be ve&s;ted in the public funds for the purpo&s;e of repairing, refur|ni&s;hing, and adding more commodious buildings in ad|dition to the &s;ame, as affluent patients may encrea&s;e, or other exigencies require: And we hereby a&s;&s;ure the public, that this, our voluntary genero&s;ity, does not mean to confine it&s;elf to the county (however exten|&s;ive) to which we belong, but will extend it&s;elf to every quarter of his Maje&s;ty's dominions. It is, there|fore, earne&s;tly reque&s;ted, that &s;uch York&s;hire Noble|men, &amp;c. as are de&s;irous of promoting an in&s;titution &s;o highly beneficial to the affluent, though unhappy part

of the nation, would meet at the Ca&s;tle of York, on Friday in the Race Week, Aug. <HI>1772</HI>, to con&s;ider of proper means for putting the &s;ame in execution, and of opening a &s;ub&s;cription for &s;o laudable a purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Had this adverti&s;ement, I &s;ay, appeared in|&s;tead of that which did then appear, is it likely (let me a&s;k my reader) that the &s;um of two thou&s;and five hundred pounds would have been immediately &s;ub&s;cribed, or that, in the &s;pace of five years more, it would have been augmented to five thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety? I per|ceive my&s;elf an&s;wered by a &s;hort negative. The &s;ub&s;cription, I agree with him, mu&s;t have pro|ceeded but &s;lowly: Let us con&s;ider, therefore, whether another adverti&s;ement like the follow|ing might not have helped it forward.</HI></P>

<P>To add to our genero&s;ity the &s;timulant of a proper degree of charity, we, the afore&s;aid Nobility and Gentry, finding that certain futile objections were made to our former adverti&s;ement, which rather im|peded our generous and di&s;intere&s;ted de&s;ign, do now further propo&s;e, that per&s;ons of moderate condition and midling fortunes may al&s;o be admitted as patients with tho&s;e in affluent circum&s;tances, provided that they al&s;o pay &s;uch rea&s;onable fees to the Phy&s;ician, and &s;uch weekly pay for board &amp;c. &amp;c. as their &s;everal circum&s;tances may permit: Nay, we even conde&s;cend to admit into it low and indigent per&s;ons, (provided they come not under the denomination of Pari&s;h Paupers) and this at the &s;mall &s;um of eight &s;hillings per week, which al&s;o may be lowered at the di&s;cretion of the Phy&s;ician and Governors, or of the Phy&s;ician only, in ca&s;es which he may judge mo&s;t for the good of the charity: But becau&s;e Pari&s;h Paupers are confe&s;&s;edly the meane&s;t of mankind, and as the intended building will be con&s;tructed chiefly for the
<PB N="37" REF="43">
accommodation of per&s;ons of &s;uperior condition, it is obvious that the&s;e Mad Paupers mu&s;t be excluded, by putting their terms of admi&s;&s;ion &s;o high as effectually to bar their ingre&s;s to the A&s;ylum.</P>
<P><HI>Whether even this more enlarged plan would have &s;o far forwarded the &s;ub&s;cription, as even to have rai&s;ed money &s;ufficient to buy the ground for the building to &s;tand upon, I &s;u&s;pect, will be almo&s;t univer&s;ally doubted. Why then (&s;ays my reader, now, perhaps, become indig|nant) fabricate two &s;uch improbable adverti&s;e|ments? My an&s;wer is, that, however improba|ble, or even ab&s;urd they may appear, the latter adverti&s;ement gives a very preci&s;e idea of what the Government of the A&s;ylum NOW IS, even before the Phy&s;ician's projected plan of &s;alary takes place; how far the former delineates what it will THEN BE I leave to future inve&s;tigators to determine.</HI></P>
