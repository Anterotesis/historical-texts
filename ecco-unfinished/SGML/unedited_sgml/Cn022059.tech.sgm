<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_NOTHING is more ea&s;y than
to di&s;cover a Thing already
found out. This is verified
in Me and that anonimous
Gentleman, whom the publick Prints have
lately complemented with a Di&s;covery to
prevent Street-Robberies; tho' by-the-by
we have only his vain <HI>Ip&s;e dixit,</HI> and
<PB N="ii" REF="9">
the o&s;tentatious Outcry of Venal News-Writers,
in his behalf.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;trip him of his borrow'd
Plumes, the&s;e are to remind the Publick,
that about &s;ix Months ago, in a Treati&s;e,
intituled, <HI>Augu&s;ta Triumphans, or the
Way to make LONDON the mo&s;t
flouri&s;hing City in the Univer&s;e,</HI> I laid
down a plain and practicable Scheme, for
the total Suppre&s;&s;ion and Prevention of
Street Robberies; which Scheme has been
approved of by &s;everal learned and ju|dicious
Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>OH! but &s;ay the Advocates of this
&s;econd-hand Schemi&s;t, our Project is to be
laid before the Parliament: Does that
make his better, or mine wor&s;e? Have
not many &s;illy Projects been laid before
Parliaments e'er now? Admit it be not
<PB N="iii" REF="10">
the &s;ame, (as I have but too much rea&s;on to
fear it is) Cannot the Members of both
Hou&s;es read Print as well as Written-hand?
Or does he think they are &s;o pre|judic'd
to di&s;like a Thing the wor&s;e for
being offer'd without view of Gain? I
tru&s;t <HI>ANDREW MORETON</HI>'s Scheme,
generou&s;ly offer'd for the Publick Good,
will meet with as fair a Reception as that
of this hireling Projector.</P>
<P>MINE is already publi&s;h'd; let him
generou&s;ly follow my Example, and no
doubt, if his Scheme be preferr'd, the Go|vernment
will reward him.</P>
<P>IF my Antagoni&s;t be nece&s;&s;itous, where
is the Merit? he does it for his own &s;ake,
not for the Publick: If he be not ne|ce&s;&s;itous,
what a &s;ordid Wretch is he to
withold his Scheme for Lucre? putting it
<PB N="iv" REF="11">
up at Publick Sale; So that if you don't
give him his Price you &s;han't have it.</P>
<P>SOME People indeed are &s;o fond of
My&s;teries, they run down every thing
that is plain and intelligible; they love
Darkne&s;s, Whi&s;pers, and <HI>Free-Ma&s;onry;</HI>
de&s;pi&s;ing whatever comes in the Shape of
a Pamphlet, be it never &s;o u&s;eful or com|mendable:
But in &s;pight of Prejudice,
Truth is the Standard, by which I hope
all hone&s;t and impartial Men will judge
me.</P>
<P>THOUGH, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I am not
a little piqued to be jocky'd out of my La|bours:
Yet not to be behind-hand with my
Gentleman in the Clouds, who would have
the Parliament buy his Pig-in-a-Poke, and
build up his Fortune at my Expence; I
have &s;o amply enlarged and amended my
<PB N="v" REF="12">
Scheme, that it is now &s;carce like the
&s;ame. I have taken in every thing po&s;&s;ible
of Comprehen&s;ion or Practice: Nor have
I left him room to edge in one &s;ingle Hint.
I have debated the Objections of divers
Wi&s;e and Learned Men, and corrected
my Project accordingly: So that on com|pari&s;on
my fir&s;t Thoughts will appear but
as a Rude and Imperfect Sketch, only
valuable in that it gave the Idea of this
more labour'd and fini&s;h'd Performance,
on which I pledge my whole Reputation,
being ready to &s;tand or fall by its Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>In order to which I have pre|&s;ented
Copies of this Book to the King
and Queen's mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ties, to
&s;everal of the Lords Spiritual, and di|vers
Honourable and Worthy Members of
both Hou&s;es; and Time mu&s;t &s;hew who&s;e
Scheme &s;hall have the Precedence.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="13">
In the mean time I &s;tand prepared for
the Sneers of tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e every thing
and every body but their own dear &s;elves;
as al&s;o the Objections of the <HI>Puzzle Cau&s;es,</HI>
who will turry-lugg a thing out of all Sen&s;e
and Meaning; and by the cloudine&s;s of
their Explanations darken what is mo&s;t
plain and obvious. My Bu&s;ine&s;s is to
go &s;traight forward, and let the End
crown the Work. If Men of Sen&s;e ap|prove
me, I need not value the Laughter
of Fools, who&s;e very Approbation is &s;can|dal:
For if a thinking Man is to be laugh'd
out of every good Intention or Invention,
nothing will ever be done for the Publick
Good.</P>

<PB REF="14">
<HEAD>SECOND
THOUGHTS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>_THE principal Encourage|ment
and Opportunity given
to Street-Robbers is, that
our Streets are &s;o poorly
watch'd; the Watchmen,
for the mo&s;t Part, being decripid, &s;uper|anuated
Wretches, with one Foot in the
Grave, and t'other ready to follow; &s;o
feeble, that a Puff of Breath can blow
'em down: Poor crazy Mortals! Much
fitter for an Alms-hou&s;e than a Watch-hou&s;e.
A City watch'd and guarded by
<PB N="2" REF="15">
&s;uch Animals, is wretchedly watch'd in|deed.</P>
<P>Nay, &s;o little Terror do they carry
with them, that hardy Thieves make a
mere Je&s;t of 'em, and oftentimes oblige
even the very Watchman, who &s;hould ap|prehend,
to light 'em in their Roguery:
And what can a poor Creature do, in
Terror of his Life, &s;urrounded by a Pack
of Ruffians, and no A&s;&s;i&s;tance near?</P>
<P>Add to this, that our Rogues are grown
more wicked than ever, and Vice in all
Kinds is &s;o much wink'd at, that Robbery
is accounted a petty Crime. We take
Pains to puff 'em up in their Villainy, and
Thieves are &s;et out in &s;o aimable a Light
in the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> it has taught
them to value them&s;elves on their Pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
rather than to be a&s;ham'd of it.</P>
<P>There was &s;ome Ce&s;&s;ation of Street-Robberies,
from the Time of <HI>Bunworth</HI>
and <HI>Blewit</HI>'s Execution, 'till the Intro|duction
of this pious Opera. Now we
find the <HI>Cartouchian</HI> Villainies revived,
<PB N="3" REF="16">
and <HI>London,</HI> that us'd to be the mo&s;t &s;afe
and peaceful City in the Univer&s;e, is now
become a Scene of Rapine and Danger.
If &s;ome of <HI>Cartouch</HI>'s Gang be not come
over hither to in&s;truct our Thieves, we
have, doubtle&s;s, a <HI>Cartouch</HI> of our own,
and a Gang, which, if not &s;uppre&s;s'd, may
be full as pernicious as was ever <HI>Cartouch</HI>'s,
and <HI>London</HI> may be as dangerous as <HI>Pa|ris,</HI>
if due Care be not taken.</P>
<P>Not content with the Mi&s;chief done by
the <HI>Beggar's Opera,</HI> we mu&s;t have a
<HI>Quaker's Opera</HI> for&s;ooth of much more
evil Tendency than the Former; for in this
<HI>Jack Shepherd</HI> is made the Hero of the
Drama, and runs through &s;uch a Scene
of Riot and Succe&s;s, that but too many
weak Minds have been drawn away, and
many unwary Per&s;ons &s;o charm'd with
his Appearance on the Stage, dre&s;t
in that elegant Manner, and his Pock|ets
&s;o well lin'd, they have forthwith
commenc'd Street-Robbers or Hou&s;e-break|ers;
&s;o that every idle Fellow, weary of
hone&s;t Labour, need but fancy him&s;elf a
<HI>Macheath</HI> or a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> and there's a
<PB N="4" REF="17">
Rogue made at once. Since therefore Exam|ple
has &s;uch Force, the Stage ought to be
reformed, and nothing exhibited but what
might be repre&s;ented before a Bi&s;hop: They
may be merry and wi&s;e: Let them take the
<HI>Provok'd Husband</HI> for a Pattern.</P>
<P>A good Phy&s;ician &s;eeks the Cau&s;e, and
weighs the Symptoms, before he proceeds
to pre&s;cribe; and if we trace this Evil from
its Radix, we &s;hall find a Cau&s;e antecedent
to the two Operas afore&s;aid: Namely,
accur&s;ed <HI>Geneva,</HI> the Bane and Ruin of
our lower Cla&s;s of People.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who deny an inferior Cla&s;s of
People to be nece&s;&s;ary in a Body Politick,
contradict Rea&s;on and Experience it&s;elf;
&s;ince they are mo&s;t u&s;eful when Indu&s;tri|ous,
and equally pernicious when lazy:
By their Indu&s;try our Manufactures, Trade,
and Commerce are carried on, The Mer|chant
in his Compting-Hou&s;e, and the
Captain in his Cabbin would find but lit|tle
Employment were it not that many
Hands carried on the different Branches
of the Concerns they &s;uperintended.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="18">
But now &s;o far are our common People
infatuated with <HI>Geneva,</HI> that half the
Work is not done now as formerly. It de|bilitates
and enervates them, nor are they
near &s;o &s;trong and healthy as formerly.</P>
<P>So that if this Abu&s;e of <HI>Geneva</HI> be not
&s;topt, we may go whoop for Husbandmen,
Labourers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trade mu&s;t con&s;equently
&s;tand &s;till, and the Credit of the Nation
&s;ink: Nor is the Abatement of the Exci&s;e,
tho' very con&s;iderable, and mo&s;t worthy
Notice, any ways comparable to the
Corruption of Manners, De&s;truction of
Health, and all the Train of Evils we
are threaten'd with from pernicious <HI>Ge|neva.</HI></P>
<P>We
will &s;uppo&s;e a Man able to maintain
him&s;elf and Family by his Trade, and at
the &s;ame time to be a <HI>Geneva</HI>-drinker:
This Fellow fir&s;t makes him&s;elf incapable
of working, by being continually drunk;
which runs him behind-hand, &s;o that he
either pawns or neglects his Work, for
which Rea&s;on no Body will employ him:
<PB N="6" REF="19">
At la&s;t, fear of Arre&s;ts, his own Hunger,
the Cries of a Family for Bread, his na|tural
De&s;ire to &s;upport an irregular Life,
and a propen&s;e Hatred to Labour, turn
but too many an hone&s;t Trade&s;man into an
arrant de&s;perate Rogue: And the&s;e are
commonly the Means that furni&s;h us with
Thieves and Villains in general.</P>
<P>Thus is a Man, who might be u&s;eful
in a Body Politick, render'd obnoxious to
the &s;ame: So that if this Trade of Wick|edne&s;s
goes on, they will increa&s;e
upon us &s;o much that we &s;hall not
dare to &s;tir out of our Habitations; nay, it
will be well if they arrive not to the Im|pudence
of plundering our Hou&s;es at Noon|day.</P>
<P>Where
is the Courage of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
Nation, that a Gentleman, with &s;ix or
&s;even Servants, &s;hall be robb'd by one
&s;ingle Highwayman? Yet we have lately
had In&s;tances of this; and for this we may
thank our E&s;&s;iminacy, our Toupee Wigs,
and powder'd Pates, our Tea, and other
&s;candalous Fopperies; and above all, the
<PB N="7" REF="20">
Di&s;u&s;e of noble and manly Sports, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to a brave People, once in Vogue,
but now totally lo&s;t among&s;t us.</P>
<P>Let not the Reader think I run from
my Subject, if I &s;earch the Bottom of the
Di&s;temper before I propo&s;e a Cure, which
having done, though indeed but &s;lightly,
for this is an Argument could be carried
to a much greater Length, I proceed to
the Purpo&s;e in manner following.</P>
<P>Let the Watch be compo&s;ed of &s;tout
able bodied Men, and of tho&s;e a &s;ufficient
Number, that is to &s;ay, a Watchman to
every forty Hou&s;es, twenty on one &s;ide of
the way, and twenty on the other; for it
is ob&s;ervable, that a Man cannot well &s;ee
di&s;tinctly beyond the Extent of twenty
Hou&s;es in a Row; if 'tis a &s;ingle Row,
and no oppo&s;ite Hou&s;es, the Charge mu&s;t
be greater, or their Safety le&s;s.</P>
<P>This Man &s;hould be elected, and paid
by the Hou&s;e-keepers them&s;elves, to pre|vent
Mi&s;application and Abu&s;e, &s;o much
<PB N="8" REF="21">
complain'd of in the Di&s;tribution of Pub|lick
Money.</P>
<P>He &s;hould be allowed 10 <HI>s. per Annum,</HI>
by each Hou&s;e-keeper, which at Forty
Hou&s;es, as above &s;pecify'd, amounts to
20 <HI>l. per Annum;</HI> almo&s;t treble to what is
at pre&s;ent allowed; and yet mo&s;t Hou&s;e-keepers
are charg'd at lea&s;t <HI>2s. 6 d.</HI> a
Quarter to the Watch, who&s;e Beat is, ge|nerally
&s;peaking, little le&s;s than the Com|pa&s;s
of half a Mile.</P>
<P>What a Shame it is, that at lea&s;t one
hundred Pounds &s;hould be collected in
&s;ome Beats, and the poor Watchman &s;hould
not have the one tenth Part of the Money?
And this I leave to the Con&s;ideration of
any Hou&s;e-keeper, who will take the
Pains to enquire into the Extent of a
Watchman's Beat, and after that ca&s;t up
what is collected in the &s;aid Beat: (as they
&s;ay for the Watch) But this is a &s;mall
Abu&s;e in Compari&s;on of other Parochial
Mi&s;applications; for a Proof of which I
refer my Reader to a Treati&s;e of mine,
Entituled, <HI>Parochial Tyranny.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="22">
This Salary of 20 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> is
&s;omething of Encouragement, and a pretty
Settlement for a poor Man, who, with
Frugality, may live decently thereon, and,
by due Re&s;t, be enabled to give due and
vigilant Attendance; that is to &s;ay, from
Evening Dusk, to Morning Light.</P>
<P>If a Hou&s;e-keeper break, or a Hou&s;e is
empty, the poor Watchman ought not to
&s;uffer, the Deficiency &s;hould be made up
by the Hou&s;e-keepers remaining.</P>
<P>The Watch thus &s;tation'd, &s;trengthen'd,
and enconraged, let every Watchman be
arm'd with Fire-Arms and Sword; and
let no Watchman &s;tand above Twenty
Doors di&s;tant from his Fellow.</P>
<P>This has already been put in Practice
in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s <HI>in the Fields,</HI>
and has had &s;o good an Effect, that 'tis
hop'd other Pari&s;hes will follow their Ex|ample,
which redounds not a little to the
Credit of our Project.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="23">
Let each Watchman be provided with a
Horn, to &s;ound an Alarm, or in Time of
Danger; and let it be made penal, if not
Felony, for any but a Watchman to &s;ound
a Horn in and about the City, from the
Time of their going on, to that of their
going off.</P>
<P>I know an Objection will be here made on
account of the Po&s;t-Boys, to obviate which,
I had Thoughts of a Bell, but that would
be too ponderous and trouble&s;ome for a
Watchman to carry, be&s;ides his Arms and
Lanthorn; whereas a Horn is portable,
always ready, and mo&s;t alarming.</P>
<P>Let the Po&s;t-Boys, therefore, u&s;e &s;ome
other Signal, &s;ince this is mo&s;t convenient
to this more material Purpo&s;e. They may
carry a Bell in a Hol&s;ter, with Ea&s;e, and
give Notice by that, as well as tho&s;e who
collect the Letters.</P>
<P>That the Watchmen may &s;ee from one
End of their Walks to the other, let a
convenient Number of Lamps be &s;et up,
<PB N="11" REF="24">
and tho&s;e not of the Convex Kind, which
blind the Eyes, and are of no manner of
U&s;e; they dazzle, but give no di&s;tinct
Light, and further, rather than prevent
Robberies. Many Per&s;ons deceived and
blinded by the&s;e <HI>Ignes fatui,</HI> have been
run over by Coaches, Carts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Peo|ple
&s;tumbling more, even under the&s;e
very Lamps, than in the Dark. In &s;hort,
they are mo&s;t unprofitable Lights, and,
in my Opinion, rather Abu&s;es than Be|nefits.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides,
I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why every ten
Hou&s;e-keepers can't find a Lamp among
them&s;elves, which would be four Lamps
in a Beat, and let their Watchman dre&s;s it,
rather than fatten a Crew of Directors:</P>
<P>But we are &s;o fond of Companies, 'tis a
Wonder we have not our Shoes black'd by
one, and a &s;et of Directors made rich at
the Expence of our very Black-guards.</P>
<P>The Watch ought to be in View, as
well as in the Hearing of each other, or
<PB N="12" REF="25">
they may be over-power'd, and much Dan|ger
may happen.</P>
<P>The Streets being thus gloriou&s;ly illu|minated,
and &s;o &s;trongly guarded by &s;tout
and able Fellows well arm'd and well
pay'd, all within the View of one another,
proceed we to &s;ecure all bye-Turnings,
Courts, Alleys, Lanes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which may
favour a Street-Robber's E&s;cape and make
our Project ineffectual.</P>
<P>A Street, Court, Lane, Alley, or other
Place, where the Number of Hou&s;es or
Poverty of the Inhabitants will not afford
a Watchman on the Terms afore-men|tion'd,
&s;hould be gated in, and the In|habitants
let in and out by the Watchman
of the Street.</P>
<P>Where there are even but twelve Hou|&s;es
in a Court, and the Inhabitants People
of Credit, they may have a &s;eparate Watch
to them&s;elves, as it practi&s;ed in <HI>Bo&s;wel-Court</HI>
by <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields, Angel-Court</HI>
in <HI>Throckmorton-Street,</HI> and many
other Places in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="26">
This I think an unexceptionable way
to &s;ecure the Cities and Suburbs of <HI>London</HI>
and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> The only Difficulty I
can conceive is, that Per&s;ons after dark
may now and then go a little Way round
about by keeping the Street Way; but
the Plea&s;antne&s;s and Safety occa&s;ion'd by
the Lights and Watch afore&s;aid, make
ample amends. Let tho&s;e go through
bye-Ways and in the dark, who&s;e Deeds
are &s;o: I am for providing Security for
Hone&s;t Men, and Ob&s;tacles for Rogues.</P>
<P>And now we have put a &s;top to their
Roguery, let us endeavour to &s;uppre&s;s the
Rogues them&s;elves: In order to which I
&s;hall begin with their Harlots, who are
generally &s;peaking, the fir&s;t Motives to
their Villainy; and egg them on to all

<P>And the&s;e are generally Servant Wenches,
who &s;troll from Place to Place, and at la&s;t
weary of working, throw them&s;elves on
the Publick: To maintain the&s;e Crea|tures
many a Man turns Rogue. It be|hoves
<PB N="14" REF="27">
the Government therefore to oblige
all young Wenches to keep in Service.
Ma&s;ters and Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es ought likewi&s;e to
&s;ee that Servants of both Sexes go not a
rambling, when &s;ent to Church; but that
they keep good Hours; for many have
been ruin'd by junketing and &s;taying
out, in&s;tead of being at Church or at
home.</P>
<P>Our Common Women ought to be re|&s;train'd
in the Liberties they have lately
taken: They openly &s;wear and talk &s;o
ob&s;cenely, 'tis a Shame to a Chri&s;tian
Country.</P>
<P>Having fully handled this Topick in
two foregoing Treati&s;es, <HI>viz. Every-Body's
Bu&s;ine&s;s is No-Body's Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI>
and <HI>Parochial Tyranny,</HI> I &s;hall not tire
my Readers with Repetition, but referring
'em to the Treati&s;es them&s;elves, return to
my Subject, which is,</P>
<P>After we have reformed the La|dies,
let us take their Sparks in hand.
And fir&s;t let all Shoe-Cleaners, I mean
<PB N="15" REF="28">
Boys and &s;turdy Vagrants be &s;uppre&s;s'd,
according to my Scheme in <HI>Every-Body's
Bu&s;ine&s;s,</HI> &amp;c. As for Link-boys, <HI>alias</HI>
Thieves with Lights, there will be no
need of 'em, when the Streets are illumi|nated,
according to my Project.</P>
<P>That Sailors as well as Soldiers may not
give cau&s;e of Su&s;picion, 'tis fit they &s;hould
al&s;o be quarter'd after the &s;ame Nature; and
more to enforce it, Surveyors of Quarters
&s;hould have Rounds allotted them.</P>
<P>The&s;e Surveyors &s;hould call at the
Quarters of every Soldier or Sailor at a
limited Hour, to &s;ee if they are there or
no, and regi&s;ter 'em at home or ab&s;ent ac|cordingly:
Ab&s;ence to be penal.</P>
<P>Every Soldier or Sailor leaving his
Quarters 'till Morning after he has been
found at home and regi&s;ter'd, &s;hould be
puni&s;hed.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed if I ward every Ob|&s;tacle,
my De&s;ign being to break up Street-Robbers
Ne&s;t and Egg.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="29">
And that Thieves may not &s;troll about,
under pretence of being de&s;titute of Lodg|ing,
Barracks or Barns &s;hould be built at
convenient Ends of the Town, where all
Vagrants &s;hould be obliged to render
them&s;elves at a &s;tated Hour, where they
&s;hould have clean Straw allow'd 'em, and be
kept orderly and out of harm's way: They
may be let loo&s;e if they have apparent
means of hone&s;t Livelihood; otherwi&s;e
they &s;hould be &s;ent to the Work-hou&s;e of
their re&s;pective Pari&s;h, or to a General
Work-hou&s;e, of which there is great need.
And of which more hereafter.</P>
<P>All Publick-Hou&s;es and Gin-Shops, if
they &s;hould be tolerated, &s;hould be &s;hut
up at ten.</P>
<P>If the Government &s;hould think fit to
tolerate Gin-Shops, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on why
they may not be &s;ubject to Licences, and
come into the Pot-Act as well as Ale-Hou&s;es;
e&s;pecially con&s;idering there is as
much Gin as Ale con&s;umed now-a-days.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="30">
Night-Hou&s;es and Cellars above all
&s;hould be totally &s;uppre&s;s'd: The&s;e are the
Harbours and Refuge of Villains and Strum|pets:
The&s;e are their Hou&s;es of Call, where
their helli&s;h Trade is carried on: It is
here they wait for the Signal of their
Scouts: Here they ca&s;t their Schemes, and
bring in Advices: Here they encourage
and initiate young Thieves: Here they
barter and &s;ell their &s;tolen Goods: The&s;e
are their Exchanges and A&s;ylums after Mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>Hackney
Coach-Drivers next require our
Care: They are the Scum of the People
and generally &s;peaking the wor&s;t of
Rogues.</P>
<P>So many and &s;uch frequent Robberies
can never be committed without the Con|nivance
of the&s;e Villains; and 'tis but too
much to be feared, that at the &s;ame time they
take up a Fare they take up a Robber, who
is ready to mark his Prey, and gets up
either on the Box or behind; and alights
at a convenient Place to perpetrate his
<PB N="18" REF="31">
helli&s;h De&s;ign. As for a Snack of the
Coal (as they term it) no doubt but the
Coachman and he have proper under|&s;tanding
and Rendezvous.</P>
<P>Many who go to the Coach-Office
now-a-days, may be mi&s;taken in their
hopes of Redre&s;s, not but the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
to a Man treat Complainants
wtth the utmo&s;t Civility; but the Penalty,
which u&s;ed to be on the Renter, being now
on the Driver, the Renter or Owner
of that Figure is clear, and the Driver
has nothing to do but to be ab&s;ent and
laugh at the Complainant, an In&s;tance
of which take in the following Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>A Hackney Coach-man took eighteen
Pence of a Gentleman for a twelve Penny
Fare: The Gentleman took his Number,
and complain'd; the Driver appear'd and
was fin'd fifteen Shillings, but the Renter
e&s;cap'd: What was the Re&s;ult? the Driver
ab&s;conded, the Gentleman &s;its down at his
lo&s;s of Attendance and Money: Had
Robbery or A&s;&s;ault been the Complaint,
the Con&s;equence had been the &s;ame, the
<PB N="19" REF="32">
Gentleman is but where he was. He has
&s;ince called &s;everal Times at the Office,
but to no purpo&s;e; all the An&s;wer he can
get is, the Fellow can't be found. I
write this therefore to undeceive tho&s;e
Per&s;ons, who think when they have taken
the Number of a Coach they can puni&s;h
the Driver for In&s;olence or Extortion.</P>
<P>The Law in this Ca&s;e ought to be
turned into its old Channel, that is to &s;ay,
the Owner of the Figure &s;hould be an|&s;werable:
He ought to employ a Driver
he can an&s;wer for, or drive him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Every Renter therefore &s;hould be o|bliged
to Regi&s;ter and Re&s;pond for his
Driver; or Commi&s;&s;ioners, Figures, and all
other Forms are to little purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Beggars &s;hould next be &s;uppre&s;s'd, who
lounge about all Day, to &s;ee where they
can &s;teal at Night. It is a &s;hame we &s;hould
&s;uffer real Objects of Charity to beg; and
for tho&s;e who are not &s;o 'tis a &s;hame but
they &s;hould work.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="33">
I &s;hall clo&s;e all with this Ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>That the Extortions and Cabals of
Trade&s;men, by enhaun&s;ing the Prices of
Provi&s;ions, is mo&s;t detrimental to a State,
and worthy the Notice of its Legi&s;lature:
For Men not being able to &s;upport their
Families by hone&s;t Labour, and being
made Beggars by rea&s;on of the Dearne&s;s
of Provi&s;ions, oftimes grow de&s;perate and
turn Rogues. This A&s;&s;ertion is but too
true, to prove which I appeal to the late
Conduct of
<LIST>
<ITEM>The Coal-Merchants,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Bakers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Butchers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>And above all the Tallow-Chandlers,</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The Cabals of Coal-Traders have for
many Years jocky'd us in the Price of
Coals; they have rai&s;ed and fell them at
plea&s;ure, and made meer &s;tock-jobbing
Work of it; but never &s;o much as in his
late Maje&s;ty's Reign; on a great Impre&s;s
for Seamen, they in le&s;s than a Fortnight
<PB N="21" REF="34">
rais'd the Price of Coals from twenty
three Shillings to almo&s;t fifty. What a
Pinch mu&s;t this be on the Poor, who live
only from Hand to Mouth, and buy their
Coals (poor Souls!) &s;ome by the half
Peck.</P>
<P>The Bakers are yet more flagrant and
vile; they turn Plenty to Famine, and
pu&s;h up the Price of Bread without Rule
or Rea&s;on; they have already been de|tected
in one Bite, <HI>i.e.</HI> procuring &s;ome of
the Fraternity to buy a &s;mall Quantity of
Corn much above the Market Price, and
then by making oath thereof, abu&s;e a
well intended Law, and rai&s;e the Price of
Bread accordingly.</P>
<P>Thus are the Poor ground to Du&s;t, in
order to fatten a Pack of Mi&s;ers, who
know no Mercy. But I hope the Go|vernment
will make 'em hone&s;t, even
again&s;t their Will.</P>
<P>The Butchers are now &s;o extravagant in
their way of living, that u&s;ual and mode|rate
<PB N="22" REF="35">
Profit won't content 'em; they can't
drink Malt Liquor, and the Poor mu&s;t
pay for the Wine which they &s;will down
at an unmerciful rate.</P>
<P>The Price of Meat &s;hould therefore be
regulated according to the Price of Cattle,
but not according to the Baker's Rule
afore-mention'd.</P>
<P>But as for the Tallow-Chandlers, their
Oppre&s;&s;ions call aloud for Redre&s;s: To
what an exorbitant Pitch have they rai&s;ed
the Price of Candles; ju&s;t double what it
was &s;ome Years ago: Nay, they threaten
to have them at ten Pence <HI>per</HI> Pound. How
can the Poor work when Candles are &s;o
dear. But we may thank our own Lux|ury
for the&s;e Impo&s;itions. I &s;ee no rea&s;on
why we &s;hould not humble the&s;e Up&s;tarts
by making our own Candles; ay, and
our own Bread too, as our Forefathers have
done before us.</P>
<P>The Tallow-Chandlers, to excu&s;e them|&s;elves,
lay the Fault on the Melters.
The Melters &s;hift it from them&s;elves to
<PB N="23" REF="36">
the Butchers: And &s;o the Game goes
round.</P>
<P>Oh but &s;ay they the Government will
lo&s;e Part of its Revenue: To which I
an&s;wer, that rather than they &s;hall
rai&s;e Candles to double their Value, on
pretence of paying a Penny <HI>per</HI> Pound Ex|ci&s;e,
in ca&s;e the Parliament will take off
the Duty on Candles for the ea&s;e of the
Poor, I will pre&s;ent 'em with a Project
<HI>gratis,</HI> which &s;hall bring in almo&s;t double
the Money now levied by Candles; and
that without the lea&s;t Hard&s;hip on the
Subject.</P>
<P>Having, I hope, taken &s;ufficient care
of Street-Robbers, I proceed now to
clear the Roads from Highway-men,
Foot-pads, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Let Parties of Hor&s;e be &s;tation'd at all
the Outgoings from the City of <HI>London;</HI>
&s;o that if a Coach, Waggon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> want
a Convoy, two, three, or more may be
detach'd by the commanding Officer;
the&s;e &s;hall be regi&s;ter'd, and an&s;werable
<PB N="24" REF="37">
for their Charge; and for Encouragement
&s;hall receive &s;o much <HI>per</HI> Mile, or in the
Whole; <HI>Convoy Money.</HI></P>
<P>This may be likewi&s;e practi&s;ed from
Town to Town all over <HI>England,</HI> &s;o that
the Roads will be as &s;afe as the Streets:
And they who will &s;cruple the Trifle of
<HI>Convoy Money</HI> above propo&s;ed, merit not
Safety.</P>
<P>For tho&s;e who walk on Foot to the
adjacent Villages, Parties of Foot may
be &s;tation'd in like manner; &s;o that not
only the Subject will be free from Danger,
but the Soldier employ'd and prevented
from corrupt Mea&s;ures by this additional
Perqui&s;ite to his Pay.</P>
<P>Nothing remains, but that Robbers be
pro&s;ecuted at the Publick Charge; the
Trials fix'd to re&s;pective Days, that Pro|&s;ecutors
may not lo&s;e &s;o much time; and
the Rewards paid in Court without De|duction
or Delay: Nor &s;hould any Rob|ber
be admitted an Evidence after he is
taken, or pardon'd after Conviction.</P>
