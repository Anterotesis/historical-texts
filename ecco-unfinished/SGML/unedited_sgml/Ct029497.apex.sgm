<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS this is the la&s;t Opportunity I &s;hall have of addre&s;&s;ing the Public this Year, I think it my Duty to return them my warme&s;t Acknowledgments for their favourable Reception of the following little Piece.</P>
<P>The three principal Characters I met with in a Summer's Expedition; they are neither vamp'd from antiquated Plays, pilfer'd from <HI>French</HI> Farces, nor the ba&s;ele&s;s Beings of the Poet's Brain. I have given them in their plain natural Habit; they wanted no dramatic Fini&s;h|ing; nor can I claim any other Merit than grouping them together, and throw|ing them into Action. The Ju&s;tice done
<PB N="6" REF="4">
them there by the Performers, has been too &s;trongly di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Town, to render any thing from me nece&s;&s;ary: I could only wi&s;h that the Managers of the Theatres would employ Mr. <HI>Ca&s;tallo,</HI> who&s;e peculiar <HI>Naivet&eacute;,</HI> and &s;trict Pro|priety, would greatly become many Cha|racters on our Stage.</P>

<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Choice, Dear <HI>Dick,</HI> is very little concern'd in the Matter: And to convince you that Love is not the Mini&s;ter of my Coun&s;els, know, that I never &s;aw but once the Object of my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e; and that too at a Time, and in a Circum&s;tance, not very likely to &s;tamp a favourable Impre&s;|&s;ion. What think you of a raw Boarding-School Girl at <HI>Lincoln</HI> Min&s;ter, with a Mind unpoli&s;h'd, a Figure uninform'd, and a Set of Features tainted with the Colours of her un|whole&s;ome Food?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="8">
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>No very engaging Object indeed, <HI>Hartop.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Thoughts now were mine then: But &s;ome Connections I have &s;ince had with her Father, have given Birth to my pre&s;ent De&s;ign upon her: You are no Stranger to the Situation of my Circum&s;tances: My Neigh|bourhood to Sir <HI>Penurious Trifle,</HI> was a &s;uf|f$$$ent Motive for his advancing what Money I wanted by way of Mortgage: The hard Terms he impos'd upon me, and the little Regard I have paid to Oeconomy, has made it nece&s;&s;ary for me to attempt by &s;ome Scheme the Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of my Fortune. This young Lady's Simplicity, not to call it Igno|rance, pre&s;ented her at once as a proper Sub|ject for my Purpo&s;e.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Succe&s;s to you, <HI>Jack,</HI> with all my Soul! A Fellow of your Spirit and Vivacity, Mankind ought to &s;upport for the Sake of them&s;elves. For whatever <HI>Seneca</HI> and the othe$ moral Writers may have &s;ugge&s;ted in Contempt of Riches, it is plain their Maxims were not calculated for the World as it now &s;tands: In Days of Yore, indeed, when Vir|tue was call'd Wi&s;dom, and Vice, Folly, &s;uch Principles might have been encourag'd; but as the pre&s;ent Subjects of our Enquiry are, not what a Man is, but what he has; as to be Rich, is to be wi&s;e and virtuous, and to be Poor, ignorant and vicious, I heartily ap|plaud your Plan!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="9">
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Ob&s;ervation is but too ju&s;t. And is it not, <HI>Dick,</HI> a little unaccountable that we who conde&s;cend &s;o &s;ervilely to copy the Follies and Fopperies of our polite Neigh|bours, &s;hould be &s;o totally aver&s;e to an Imi|tation of their Virtues? In <HI>France,</HI> has he Wealth? is an Interrogation never put 'till they are di&s;appointed in their Inquires after the Birth and Wi&s;dom of a fa&s;hionable Fel|low: But here, How much a Year&mdash;Two Thou&s;and.&mdash;The Devil! In what County? <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI> Indeed? God ble&s;s us! A happy Dog! How the duce come I to be intere&s;ted in a Man's Fortune, unle&s;s I am his Steward or his Taylor: Indeed Knowledge and Ge|nius are worth examining into; by tho&s;e my Under&s;tanding may be improv'd, or my Ima|gination gratify'd; but why &s;uch a Man's be|ing able to eat <HI>Ortolans,</HI> and drink <HI>French</HI> Wine, is to recommend him to my E&s;teem, is what I can't readily conceive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>This Complaint may with Ju&s;tice be made of all Imitations: The ridiculous Side is ever the Object imitated. But a Truce to moralizing, and to our Bu&s;ine&s;s. Prithee, in the fir&s;t Place, how can you gain Admittance to your Mi&s;tre&s;s? And in the &s;econd, is the Girl independent of her Father? His Con|&s;ent, I &s;uppo&s;e, you have no Thought of ob|taining.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some farther Propo&s;als concerning my E&s;tate; &s;uch as an Increa&s;e of the Mort|gage,
<PB N="4" REF="10">
or an ab&s;olute Sale, is a &s;ufficient Pre|tence for a Vi&s;it: And as to the Ca&s;h, Twenty to my Knowledge; independent too, you Rogue! And be&s;ides, an only Child, you know: And then, when Things are done, they can't be undone&mdash;And 'tis well it's no wor&s;e&mdash;and a Hundred &s;uch pretty Proverbs, will, it's great Odds, reconcile the old Fel|low at la&s;t. Be&s;ides, my Papa <HI>in po&s;&s;e,</HI> has a Foible, which, if I conde&s;cend to humour, I have his Soul, my Dear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee, now you are in Spirits, give me a Portrait of Sir <HI>Penurious;</HI> tho' he is my Neighbour, yet is he &s;o dome&s;tic an Animal, that I know no more of him than the common Country Conver&s;ation; that he is a thrifty, wary Man.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Har.</SPEAKER>
<P>The very Ab&s;tract of Penury! Sir <HI>John Cutler,</HI> with his tran&s;migrated Stock|ings, was but a Type of him. For in&s;tance, the Barber has the Growth of his and his Daughter's Head once a Year, for &s;having the Knight once a Fortnight; his Shoes are made with the Leather of a Coach of his Grand|father's, built in the Year, One; his Male-Servant is Footman, Groom, Carter, Coach|man, and Taylor; his Maid employs her lei|&s;ure Hours in Plain-Work for the Neighbours, which, Sir <HI>Penurious</HI> takes care, as her La|bour is for his Emolument, &s;hall be as many as po&s;&s;ible, by joining with his Daughter in &s;couring the Rooms, making the Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="11">
thus much for his moral Character. Then as to his intellectual, he is a mere <HI>Charte Blanche;</HI> the la&s;t Man he is with mu&s;t afford him Matter for the next he goes to; but a Story is his Idol, throw him in that, and he &s;wal|lows it; no matter what, raw or roa&s;ted, &s;avoury or in&s;ipid, down it goes, and up again to the fir&s;t Per&s;on he meets: It is upon this Ba&s;is I found my Favour with the Knight, having acquir'd Patience enough to hear his Stories, and equip'd my&s;elf with a Quantity &s;ufficient to furni&s;h him; his Manner is in|deed peculiar, and for once or twice enter|taining enough. I'll give you a Specimen&mdash;Is not that an Equipage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Jenk.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hey! Yes, faith, and the Owner, an Acquaintance of mine: Sir <HI>Gregory Ga|zette,</HI> by <HI>Jupiter!</HI> and his Son <HI>Tim</HI> with him. Now I can match your Knight. He mu&s;t come this way to the Parlour. We'll have a Scene; but take your Cue; he is a Country Politician.</P>
