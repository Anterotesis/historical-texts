<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the GENERAL PRINCIPLES of MORALS.</HEAD>
<P>DISPUTES with per&s;ons, pertinaciou&s;ly ob|&s;tinate
in their principles, are, of all others,
the mo&s;t irk&s;ome; except, perhaps, tho&s;e
with per&s;ons, intirely di&s;ingenuous, who really do not
believe the opinion they defend, but engage in the
controver&s;y, from affectation, from a &s;pirit of oppo|&s;ition,
or from a de&s;ire of &s;howing wit and ingenuity,
&s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind. The &s;ame blind ad|herence
to their own arguments is to be expected in
both; the &s;ame contempt of their antagoni&s;ts; and
the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ionate vehemence, in inforcing &s;ophi&s;try
and fal&s;hood. And as rea&s;oning is not the &s;ource,
whence either di&s;putant derives his tenets; tis in vain
to expect, that any logic, which &s;peaks not to the af|fections,
will ever engage him to embrace $ounder
principles.</P>
<P>THOSE who have denied the reality of moral di&s;|tinctions,
may be ranked among the di&s;ingenuous di&s;|putants;
<PB N="4" REF="8">
nor is it conceivable, that any human crea|ture
could ever &s;eriou&s;ly believe, that all characters
and actions were alike intitled to the affection and re|gard
of every one. The difference, which nature has
placed between one man and another, is &s;o wide, and
this difference is &s;till &s;o much farther widened, by edu|cation,
example, and habit, that where the oppo&s;ite
extremes come at once under our apprehen&s;ion, there
is no &s;ceptici&s;m &s;o &s;crupulous, and &s;carce any a&s;&s;urance
&s;o determined, as ab&s;olutely to deny all di&s;tinction be|tween
them. Let a man's in&s;en&s;ibility be ever &s;o
great, he mu&s;t often be touched with the images of
RIGHT and WRONG; and let his prejudices
be ever &s;o ob&s;tinate, he mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that others are
&s;u&s;ceptible of like impre&s;&s;ions. The only way, there|fore,
of converting an antagoni&s;t of this kind, is to
leave him to him&s;elf. For, finding that no body
keeps up the controver&s;y with him, 'tis probable he
will, at la&s;t, of him&s;elf, from mere wearine&s;s, come
over to the &s;ide of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THERE has been a controver&s;y &s;tarted of late,
much better worth examination, concerning the ge|neral
foundation of MORALS; whether they are
derived from REASON, or from SENTI|MENT;
whether we attain the knowlege of them
by a chain of argument and induction, or by an im|mediate
feeling and finer internal &s;en&s;e; whether,
like all &s;ound judgment of truth and fal&s;hood, they
<PB N="5" REF="9">
&s;hould be the &s;ame to every rational intelligent being;
or whether, like the perception of beauty and de&s;or|mity,
they are founded intirely on the particular fa|bric
and con&s;titution of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>THE antient philo&s;ophers, tho' they often affirm,
that virtue is nothing but conformity to rea&s;on, yet, in
general, &s;eem to con&s;ider morals as deriving their ex|i&s;tence
from ta&s;te and &s;entiment. On the other hand,
our modern inquirers, tho' they al&s;o talk much of the
beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice, yet have
commonly endeavoured to account for the&s;e di&s;tinc|tions
by metaphy&s;ical rea&s;onings, and by deductions
from the mo&s;t ab&s;tract principles of human under|&s;tanding.
Such confu&s;ion reigned in the&s;e &s;ubjects,
that an oppo&s;ition of the greate&s;t con&s;equence could
prevail between one &s;y&s;tem and another, and even
in the parts almo&s;t of each individual &s;y&s;tem; and yet
no body, till very lately, was ever &s;en&s;ible of it. The
elegant Lord SHAFTESBURY, who fir&s;t gave occa&s;ion
to remark this di&s;tinction, and who, in general, adhe|red
to the principles of the antients, is not&punc; him&s;elf,
intirely free from the &s;ame confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowleged, that both &s;ides of the
que&s;tion are &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;pecious arguments. Moral
di&s;tinctions, it may be &s;aid, are di&s;cernible by pure
<HI>rea&s;on:</HI> Elfe, whence the many di&s;putes that reign in
common life, as well as in philo&s;ophy, with regard to
<PB N="6" REF="10">
this &s;ubject: The long chain of proofs often produced
on both &s;ides; the examples cited, the authorities ap|pealed
to, the analogies employed, the fallacies detect|ed,
the inferences drawn, and the &s;everal conclu&s;ions
adju&s;ted to their proper principles. Truth is di&s;pu|table;
not, ta&s;te: What exi&s;ts in the nature of things
is the &s;tandard of our judgment; what each man
feels within him&s;elf is the &s;tandard of &s;entiment. Pro|po&s;itions
in geometry may be proved, &s;y&s;tems in phy|&s;ics
may be controverted; but the harmony of ver&s;e,
the tenderne&s;s of pa&s;&s;ion, the brilliancy of wit, mu&s;t
give immediate plea&s;ure. No man rea&s;ons concern|ing
another's beauty; but frequently concerning the
ju&s;tice or inju&s;tice of his actions. In every trial the
fir&s;t object of the criminals is to di&s;prove the facts al|leged,
and deny the actions imputed to them: The
&s;econd to prove, that even if the&s;e actions were real,
they might be ju&s;tified, as innocent and lawful. 'Tis
confe&s;&s;edly by deductions of the under&s;tanding, that
the fir&s;t point is a&s;certained: How can we &s;uppo&s;e,
that a different faculty of the mind is employed in fix|ing
the other?</P>
<P>ON the other hand, tho&s;e who would re&s;olve all
moral determinations into <HI>&s;entiment,</HI> may endeavour to
&s;now, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for rea&s;on ever to draw con|clu&s;ions
of this nature. To virtue, &s;ay they, it be|longs
to be <HI>amiable,</HI> and vice <HI>odious.</HI> This forms their
very nature or e&s;&s;ence. But can rea&s;on or argumenta|tion
<PB N="7" REF="11">
di&s;tribute the&s;e different epithets to any &s;ubjects,
and pronounce beforehand, that this mu&s;t produce
love, and that hatred? Or what other rea&s;on can we
ever a&s;&s;ign for the&s;e affections, but the original fabric
and formation of the human mind, which is naturally
adapted to receive them?</P>
<P>THE end of all moral &s;peculations is to teach us
our duty: and, by proper repre&s;entations of the de|formity
of vice and beauty of virtue, beget corre&s;pon|dent
habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and em|brace
the other. But is this ever to be expected from
inferences and conclu&s;ions of the under&s;tanding, which
of them&s;elves have no hold of the affections, nor &s;et in
motion the active powers of men? They di&s;cover
truths: but where the truths which they di&s;cover are
indifferent, and beget no de&s;ire or aver&s;ion, they can
have no influence on conduct and behaviour. What
is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is
noble, what is generous, takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart,
and animates us to embrace and maintain it. What is
intelligible, what is evident, what is probable, what is
true, procures only the cool a&s;&s;ent of the under&s;tand|ing;
and gratifying a &s;peculative curio&s;ity puts an end
to our re&s;earches.</P>
<P>EXTINGUISH all the warm feelings and prepo&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
in favour of virtue, and all di&s;gu&s;t or aver&s;ion
again&s;t vice: Render men totally indifferent towards
<PB N="8" REF="12">
the&s;e di&s;tinctions; and morality is no longer a prac|tical
&s;tudy, nor has any tendency to regulate our lives
and actions.</P>
<P>THESE arguments on each &s;ide (and many more
might be produced) are &s;o plau&s;ible, that I am apt to
&s;u&s;pect, they may, the one as well as the other, be &s;o|lid
and &s;atisfactory, and that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>&s;entiment</HI> con|cur
in almo&s;t all moral determinations and conclu&s;ions.
The final &s;entence, 'tis probable, which pronounces
characters and actions amiable or odious, prai&s;e-worthy
or blameable; that which &s;tamps on them the mark
of honour or infamy, approbation or cen&s;ure; that
which renders morality an active principle, and con&s;ti|tutes
virtue our happine&s;s, and vice our mi&s;ery:
'Tis probable, I &s;ay, that this final &s;entence depends
on &s;ome internal &s;en&s;e or feeling, which nature has
made univer&s;al in the whole &s;pecies. For what el&s;e
can have an influence of this nature? But in order to
pave the way for &s;uch a &s;entiment, and give a proper
di&s;cernment of its object, 'tis often nece&s;&s;ary, we find,
that much rea&s;oning &s;hould precede, that nice di&s;tinc|tions
be made, ju&s;t conclu&s;ions drawn, di&s;tant compa|ri&s;ons
formed, complicated relations examined, and
general facts fixed and a&s;certained. Some &s;pecies of
beauty, e&s;pecially the natural kinds, on their fir&s;t ap|pearance,
command our affection and approbation;
and where they fail of this effect, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for
any rea&s;oning to redre&s;s their influence, or adapt them
<PB N="9" REF="13">
better to our ta&s;te &s;entiment. But in many orders
of beauty, particularly tho&s;e of the finer arts, 'tis re|qui&s;ite
to employ much rea&s;oning, in order to feel the
proper &s;entiment; and a fal&s;e reli&s;h may frequently
be corrected by argument and reflection. There are
ju&s;t grounds to conclude, that moral beauty partakes
much of this latter &s;pecies, and demands the a&s;&s;i&s;tance
of our intellectual faculties, in order to give it a &s;uit|able
influence on the human mind.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this que&s;tion, concerning the general
principles of morals, be extremely curious and import|ant,
'tis needle&s;s for us, at pre&s;ent, to employ farther
care in our re&s;earches concerning it. For if we can
be &s;o happy, in the cour&s;e of this inquiry, as to di&s;co|ver
the true origin of morals, it will then ea&s;ily appear
how far &s;entiment or rea&s;on enter into all determina|tions
of this nature<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix fir&s;t.</NOTE>. Mean while, it will &s;carce be
po&s;&s;ible for us, ere this controver&s;y is fully decided, to
proceed in that accurate manner, required in the &s;ci|ences;
by beginning with exact definitions, of VIR|TUE
and VICE, which are the objects of our pre|&s;ent
inquiry. But we &s;hall do what may ju&s;tly be
e&s;teemed as &s;atisfactory. We &s;hall con&s;ider the mat|ter
as an object of experience. We &s;hall call <HI>every
quality or action of the mind,</HI> virtuous, <HI>which is attend|ed
with the approbation of the &s;pectator:</HI> And we &s;hall
denominate vicious, <HI>every quality, which is the object
<PB N="10" REF="14">
of bis blame or cen&s;ure.</HI> The&s;e qualities we &s;hall en|deavour
to collect; and after examining, on both
&s;ides, the &s;everal circum&s;tances, in which they agree,
'$is hoped we may, at la&s;t, reach the foundation of
ethics, and find tho&s;e univerfal principles, from which
all moral cen&s;ure or approbation is ultimately derived.
As this is a que&s;tion of fact, not of ab&s;tract &s;cience,
we can only expect &s;ucce&s;s, by following the experi|mental
method, and deducing general maxims from a
compari&s;on of particular in&s;tances. The other &s;cien|tifical
method, where a general ab&s;tract principle is
fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed, and is afterwards branched out into a
variety of inferences and conclu&s;ions, may be more
perfect in it&s;elf, but &s;uits le&s;s the imperfection of hu|man
nature, and is a common &s;ource of illu&s;ion and
mi&s;take in this as well as in other &s;ubjects. Men are
now cured of their pa&s;&s;ion for hypothe&s;es and &s;y&s;tems
in natural philo&s;ophy, and will hearken to no argu|ments
but tho&s;e derived from experience. 'Tis full
time that they &s;hould begin a like reformation in all
moral di&s;qui&s;itions; and reject every &s;y&s;tem of ethics,
however &s;ubtile or ingenious, which is not founded
on fact and ob&s;ervation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a principle, &s;uppo&s;ed to prevail among
many, which is utterly incompatible with all
virtue or moral &s;entiment; and as it can proceed from
nothing but the mo&s;t depraved di&s;po&s;ition; &s;o in its
turn it tends &s;till farther to encourage that depravity.
This principle is, that all <HI>benevolence</HI> is mere hypo|cri&s;y,
friend&s;hip a cheat, public &s;pirit a farce, fidelity
a &s;nare to procure tru&s;t and confidence; and while all
of us, at the bottom, pur&s;ue only our private in|tere&s;t,
we wear the&s;e fair di&s;gui&s;es, in order to put
others off their guard, and expo&s;e them the more
to our wiles and machinations. What heart one
mu&s;t be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of who profe&s;&s;es &s;uch principles, and
who feels no internal &s;entiment that belies &s;o perni|cious
a theory, 'tis ea&s;y to imagine: And al&s;o, what
degree of affection and benevolence he can bear to a
&s;pecies, whom he repre&s;ents under &s;uch odious co|lours,
<PB N="12" REF="16">
and &s;uppo&s;es &s;o little &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude or
any return of affection. Or if we will not a&s;cribe
the&s;e principles wholly to a corrupted heart, we mu&s;t,
at lea&s;t account for them from the mo&s;t carele&s;s and
precipitant examination. Super&s;icial rea&s;oners, in|deed,
ob&s;erving many fal&s;e pretences among man|kind,
and feeling, perhaps, no very &s;trong re&s;traint
in their own di&s;po&s;ition, might draw a general and a
ha&s;ty conclu&s;ion, that all is equally corrupted, and
that men, different from all other animals, and indeed
from all other &s;pecies of exi&s;tence, admit of no de|grees
of good or bad, but are, in every in&s;tance, the
&s;ame creatures, under different di&s;gui&s;es and appear|ances.</P>
<P>THERE is another principle, &s;omewhat re&s;embling
the former; which has been much in&s;i&s;ted on by phi|lo&s;ophers,
and has been the foundation of many a
&s;y&s;tem; that whatever affection one may feel, or ima|gine
he feels for others, no pa&s;&s;ion is, or can be di&s;in|tere&s;ted;
that the mo&s;t generous friend&s;hip, however
&s;incere, is a modification of &s;elf-love; and that, even
unknown to our&s;elves, we &s;eek only our own gratifi|cation,
while we appear the mo&s;t deeply engaged in
&s;chemes for the liberty and happine&s;s of mankind.
By a turn of imagination, by a refinement of reflection,
by an enthu&s;ia&s;m of pa&s;&s;ion, we feem to take part in
the intere&s;ts of others, and imagine our&s;elves dive&s;ted
of all &s;elfi&s;h con&s;iderations: But, at bottom, the mo&s;t
<PB N="13" REF="17">
generous patriot and mo&s;t niggardly mi&s;er, the brave&s;t
hero and mo&s;t abject coward, have, in every action,
an equal regard to their own happine&s;s and welfare.</P>
<P>WHOEVER concludes, from the &s;eeming tendency
of this opinion, that tho&s;e, who make profe&s;&s;ion of it,
cannot po&s;&s;ibly feel the true &s;entiments of benevolence,
or have any regard for genuine virtue, will often find
him&s;elf, in practice, very much mi&s;taken. Probity
and honour were no &s;trangers to EPICURUS and his
&s;ect. ATTICUS and HORACE &s;eem to have enjoyed
from nature, and cultivated by reflection, as gene|rous
and friendly di&s;po&s;itions as any di&s;ciple of the au|&s;terer
&s;chools. And among the moderns, HOBBES
and LOCKE, who maintained the &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem of mo|rals,
lived mo&s;t irreproachable lives; tho' the former
lay not under any re&s;traint of religion, which might
&s;upply the defects of his philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>AN EPICUREAN or a HOBBIST readily allows, that
there is &s;uch a thing as friend&s;hip is the world, with|out
hypocri&s;y or di&s;gui&s;e; tho' he may attempt, by a
philo&s;ophical chymi&s;try, to re&s;olve the elements of
this pa&s;&s;ion, if I may &s;o &s;peak, into tho&s;e of another,
and explain every affection to be &s;elf-love, twi&s;ted and
moulded into a variety of appearances. But as the
&s;ame turn of imagination prevails not in every man,
nor gives the &s;ame direction to the original pa&s;&s;ion;
this is &s;ufficient, even according to the &s;elfi&s;h &s;y&s;tem,
<PB N="14" REF="18">
to make the wide&s;t difference in human characters, and
denominate one man virtuous and humane, another
vicious and meanly intere&s;ted. I e&s;teem the man,
who&s;e &s;elf love, by whatever means, is &s;o directed as
to give him a concern for others, and render him &s;er|viceable
to &s;ociety: As I hate or de&s;pi&s;e him, who has
no regard to any thing beyond his own gratifications
and enjoyments. In vain would you &s;ugge&s;t, that
the&s;e characters, tho' &s;eemingly oppo&s;ite, are, at bot|tom,
the &s;ame, and that a very incon&s;iderable turn of
imagination forms the whole difference between them.
Each character, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e incon&s;iderable
differences, appears to me, in practice, pretty durable
and untran&s;mutable. And I find not in this, more than
in other &s;ubjects, that the natural &s;entiments, ari&s;ing
from the general appearances of things, are ea&s;ily de|&s;troyed
by &s;ubtile reflections concerning the minute
origin of the&s;e appearances. Does not the lively,
chearful colour of a countenance in&s;pire me with com|placency
and plea&s;ure; even tho' I learn from philo|&s;ophy,
that all difference of complexion ari&s;es from
the mo&s;t minute differences of thickne&s;s, in the mo&s;t
minute parts of the &s;kin; by means of which a &s;uper|ficies
is qualified to reflect one of the original colours
of light, and ab&s;orb the others?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the que&s;tion, concerning the univer&s;al or
partial &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of man, be not &s;o material, as is u&s;u|ally
imagined, to morality and practice, it is certain|ly
<PB N="15" REF="19">
of con&s;equence in the &s;peculative &s;cience of human
nature, and is a proper object of curio&s;ity and inquiry.
It may not, therefore, be improper, in this place, to
beflow a few reflections upon it<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Benevolence naturally divides into two kinds, the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular.</HI> The fir&s;t is, where we have no friend&s;hip or connexion or e&s;teem for the per&s;on, but feel only a general &s;ym|pathy with him or a compa&s;&s;ion for his pains, and a congratu|lation with his plea&s;ures. The other &s;pecies of benevolence is founded on an opinion of virtue, on &s;ervices done us, or on &s;ome particular connexions. Both the&s;e &s;entiments mu&s;t be al|lowed real in human nature; but whether they will re&s;olve into &s;ome nice con&s;iderations of &s;elf-love, is a que&s;tion more curious than important. The former &s;entiment, <HI>viz.</HI> that of general benevolence, or humanity, or &s;ympathy, we &s;hall have occa&s;ion frequently to treat of in the cour&s;e of this inquiry; and I a&s;&s;ume it as real, from general experience, without any other proof.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t obvious objection to the &s;elfi&s;h hypothe|fis,
is, that as it is contrary to common feeling and
our mo&s;t unprejudiced notions; there is required the
highe&s;t &s;tretch of philo&s;ophy to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;o extraor|dinary
a paradox. To the mo&s;t carele&s;s ob&s;erver,
there appear to be &s;uch di&s;po&s;itions as benevolence
and genero&s;ity; &s;uch affections as love, friend&s;hip,
compa&s;&s;ion, gratitude. The&s;e &s;entiments have their
cau&s;es, effects, objects, and operations, marked by
common language and ob&s;ervation, and plainly di&s;|tingui&s;hed
from tho&s;e of the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions. And as
<PB N="16" REF="20">
this is the obvious appearance of things, it mu&s;t be
admitted; till &s;ome hypothe&s;is be di&s;covered, which,
by penetrating deeper into human nature, may prove
the former affections to be nothing but modifications
of the latter. All attempts of this kind have hitherto
proved fruitle&s;s, and &s;eem to have proceeded intirely
from that love of <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> which has been the &s;ource
of much fal&s;e rea&s;oning in philo&s;ophy. I &s;hall not
here enter into any detail on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject. Many
able philo&s;ophers have &s;hown the in&s;ufficiency of the&s;e
&s;y&s;tems. And I &s;hall take for granted what, I believe,
the &s;malle&s;t reflection will make evident to every im|partial
inquirer.</P>
<P>BUT the nature of the &s;ubject furni&s;hes the &s;trong|e&s;t
pre&s;umption, that no better &s;y&s;tem will ever, for
the future, be invented, in order to account for the
origin of the benevolent from the &s;elfi&s;h affections,
and reduce all the various emotions of the human
mind to a perfect &s;implicity. The ca&s;e is not the &s;ame
in this &s;pecies of philo&s;ophy as in phy&s;ics. Many an
hypothe&s;is in nature, contrary to fir&s;t appearances, has
been found, on more accurate &s;crutiny, &s;olid and &s;ati&s;|factory.
In&s;tances of this kind are &s;o frequent, that a
judicious, as well as witty philo&s;opher<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s; FONTENELLE.</NOTE>, has ventured
to affirm, if there be more than one way, in which
any phaenomenon may be produced, that there is a
<PB N="17" REF="21">
general pre&s;umption for its ari&s;ing from the cau&s;es
which are the lea&s;t obvious and familiar. But the
pre&s;umption always lies on the other fide, in all in|quiries
concerning the origin of our pa&s;&s;ions, and of
the internal operations of the human mind. The
&s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious cau&s;e, which can there be
a&s;&s;igned for any phaenomenon, is probably the true
one. When a philo&s;opher, in the explication of his
&s;y&s;tem, is obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;ome very in
tricate and refined reflections, and to &s;uppo&s;e them e&s;|&s;ential
to the production of any pa&s;&s;ion or emotion,
we have rea&s;on to be extremely on our guard again&s;t
&s;o fallacious an hypothe&s;is. The affections are not
&s;u&s;ceptible of any impre&s;&s;ion from the refinements of
rea&s;on or imagination; and 'tis always found, that a
vigorous exertion of the latter faculties, nece&s;&s;arily,
from the narrow capacity of the human mind, de|&s;troys
all activity in the former. Our predominant
motive or intention is, indeed, frequently concealed
from our&s;elves, when it is mingled and confounded
with other motives which the mind, from vanity or
&s;elf-conceit, is de&s;irous of &s;uppofing more prevalent:
But there is no in&s;tance, that a concealment of this
nature has ever ari&s;en from the ab&s;tru&s;ene&s;s and intri|cacy
of the motive. A man, who has lo&s;t a friend and
patron, may flatter him&s;elf, that all his grief ari&s;es
from generous &s;entiments, without any mixture of
narrow or intere&s;ted con&s;iderations: But a man, who
grieves for a valuable friend, who needed his patron|age
<PB N="18" REF="22">
and protection; how can we &s;uppo&s;e, that his
pa&s;&s;ionate tenderne&s;s ari&s;es from &s;ome metaphy&s;ical re|gards
to a &s;elf-intere&s;t, which has no foundation or
reality? We may as well imagine, that minute wheels
and &s;prings, like tho&s;e of a watch, give motion to a
loaded waggon, as account for the origin of pa&s;&s;ion
from &s;uch ab&s;tru&s;e reflections.</P>
<P>ANIMALS are found &s;u&s;ceptible of kindne&s;s, both
to their own &s;pecies and to ours; nor is there, in this
cafe, the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of di&s;gui&s;e or artifice. Shall
we account for all <HI>their</HI> &s;entiments too, from refined
deductions of &s;elf intere&s;t? Or if we admit a di&s;inte|re&s;ted
benevolence in the inferior &s;pecies, by what rule
of analogy can we refu&s;e it in the &s;uperior?</P>
<P>LOVE between the &s;exes begets a complacency and
good-will, very di&s;tinct from the gratification of an
appetite. Tenderne&s;s to their offspring, in all &s;en&s;ible
beings, is commonly able alone to counterbalance the
&s;tronge&s;t motives of &s;elf-love, and has no manner of
dependance on that affection. What intere&s;t can a
fond mother have in view, who lo&s;es her health by a&s;|&s;iduous
attendance on her &s;ick child, and afterwards
langui&s;hes and dies of grief, when freed, by its death,
from the &s;lavery of that attendance?</P>
<P>Is gratitude no affection of the human brea&s;t, or is
that a word merely without any meaning or reality?
<PB N="19" REF="23">
Have we no &s;atisfaction in one man's company above
another's, and no de&s;ire of the welfare of our friend,
even tho' ab&s;ence or death &s;hould prevent us from all
participation in it? Or what is it commonly, that
gives us any participation in it, even while alive and
pre&s;ent, but our affection and regard to him?</P>
<P>THESE and a thou&s;and other in&s;tances are marks of
a general benevolence in human nature, where no <HI>real</HI>
intere&s;t binds us to the object. And how an <HI>imagi|nary</HI>
intere&s;t, known and avowed for &s;uch, can be the
origin of any pa&s;&s;ion or emotion, &s;eems difficult to ex|plain.
No &s;atisfactory hypothe&s;is of this kind has yet
been di&s;covered; nor is there the &s;malle&s;t probability,
that the future indu&s;try of men will ever be attended
with more favourable &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if we con&s;ider rightly of the matter,
we &s;hall find, that the hypothe&s;is, which allows of a
di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence, di&s;tinct from &s;elf love, has
really more <HI>&s;implicity</HI> in it, and is more conformable to
the analogy of nature, than that which pretends to re|&s;olve
all friend&s;hip and humanity into this latter prin|ciple.
There are bodily wants or appetites, acknow|leged
by every one, which nece&s;&s;arily precede all &s;en|&s;ual
enjoyment, and carry us directly to &s;eek po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the object. Thus, hunger and thir&s;t have eating
and drinking for their end; and from the grati|fication
of the&s;e primary appetites ari&s;es a plea|&s;ure,
<PB N="20" REF="24">
which may become the object of another &s;pecies
of de&s;ire or inclination, that is &s;econdary and intere&s;t|ed.
In the &s;ame manner, there are mental pa&s;&s;ions,
by which we are impelled immediately to &s;eek parti|cular
objects, &s;uch as fame or power, or vengeance,
without any regard to intere&s;t; and when the&s;e ob|jects
are attained, a plea&s;ing enjoyment en&s;ues, as the
con&s;equence of our indulged affections. Nature mu&s;t,
by the internal frame and con&s;titution of the mind,
give an original propen&s;ity to fame, ere we can reap
any plea&s;ure from that acqui&s;ition, or pur&s;ue it from
motives of &s;elf-love, and a de&s;ire of happine&s;s. If I
have no vanity, I take no delight in prai&s;e: If I be
void of ambition, power gives me no enjoyment. If I
be not angry, the puni&s;hment of an adver&s;ary is to|tally
indifferent to me. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, there is a
pa&s;&s;on, which points immediately to the object, and
con&s;titutes it our good or happine&s;s; as there are
other &s;econdary pa&s;&s;ions, which afterwards ari&s;e, and
pur&s;ue it as a part of our happine&s;s, when once it is
con&s;tituted &s;uch by our original affections. Were
there no appetites of any kind antecedent to &s;elf-love,
that propen&s;ity could &s;carce ever exert it&s;elf; becau&s;e
we &s;hould, in that ca&s;e, have felt few and &s;lender pains
or plea&s;ures, and have little mi&s;ery or happine&s;s to
avoid or to pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>Now where is the difficulty of conceiving, that this
may likewi&s;e be the ca&s;e with benevolence and friend|&s;hip,
<PB N="21" REF="25">
and that, from the original frame of our temper,
we may feel a de&s;ire of another's happine&s;s or good,
which, by means of that affection, becomes our own
good, and is afterwards pur&s;ued, from the conjoined
motives of benevolence and &s;elf-enjoyment? Who
&s;ees not that vengeance, from the force alone of pa&s;|&s;ion,
may be &s;o eagerly pur&s;ued, as to make us know|ingly
neglect every con&s;ideration of ea&s;e, intere&s;t, or
&s;afety; and, like &s;ome vindictive animals, infu&s;e our
very &s;ouls into the wounds we give an enemy<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Anima&s;que in vulnere ponunt. VIRG.</P>
<P>Dum alteri noceat, &s;ui negligens, &s;ays SENECA of Anger, De Ira, L. X.</P></NOTE>? And
what a malignant philo&s;ophy mu&s;t it be, that will not
allow, to humanity and friend&s;hip, the &s;ame privi|leges,
which are indi&s;putably granted to the darker
pa&s;&s;ions of enmity and re&s;entment? Such a philo&s;ophy
is more like a &s;atyr than a true delineation or de&s;crip|tion
of human nature; and may be a good founda|tion
for paradoxical wit and raillery, but is a very bad
one for any &s;erious argument or rea&s;oning.</P>

<P>IT may be e&s;teemed, perhaps, a &s;uperfluous ta&s;k to
prove, that the benevolent or &s;ofter affections are
VIRTUOUS; and wherever they appear, engage
the e&s;teem, approbation, and good-will of mankind.
The epithets <HI>&s;ociable, good-natured, humane, merciful,
<PB N="22" REF="26">
grateful, friendly, generous, beneficent,</HI> are known in all
languages, and univer&s;ally expre&s;s the highe&s;t merit,
which <HI>human nature</HI> is capable of attaining. Where
the&s;e amiable qualities are attended with birth and
power and eminent abilities, and di&s;play them&s;elves in
the good government or u&s;eful in&s;truction of mankind,
they &s;eem even to rai&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of them above

mea&s;ure to the divine. Exalted capacity, undaunted
courage, pro&s;perous &s;ucce&s;s; the&s;e may only expo&s;e a
hero or politician to the envy and malignity of the
public: But as &s;oon as the prai&s;es are added of hu|mane
and beneficent; when in&s;tances are di&s;played of
lenity, tenderne&s;s, or friend&s;hip; envy it&s;elf is &s;ilent,
or joins the general voice of applau&s;e and accla|mation.</P>
<P>WHEN PERICLES, the great ATHENIAN &s;tate&s;man
and general, was on his death-bed, his &s;urrounding
friends, deeming him now in&s;en&s;ible, began to in|dulge
their &s;orrow for their expiring patron, by enu|merating
his great qualities and &s;ucce&s;&s;es, his con|que&s;ts
and victories, the unu&s;ual length of his admi|ni&s;tration,
and his nine trophies erected over the ene|mies
of the republic. <HI>You forget,</HI> cries the dying he|ro,
who had heard all, <HI>you forget the mo&s;t eminent of
my prai&s;es, while you dwell &s;o much on tho&s;e vulgar ad|vantages,
in which fortune had a principal &s;hare. You
<PB N="23" REF="27">
have not ob&s;erved, that no citizen has ever yet worne
mourning on my account</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLUT. in PERICLE.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN men of more ordinary talents and capacity, the
&s;ocial virtues become, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more e&s;&s;entially
requi&s;ite; there being nothing eminent, in that ca&s;e,
to compen&s;ate for the want of them, or pre&s;erve the
per&s;on from our &s;evere&s;t hatred, as well as contempt.
A high ambition, an elevated courage, is apt, &s;ays
CICERO, in le&s;s perfect characters, to degenerate into
a turbulent ferocity. The more &s;ocial and &s;ofter vir|tues
are there chiefly to be regarded. The&s;e are al|ways
good and amiable<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">CIC. de Off$iis, lib. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE principal advantage, which JUVENAL di&s;co|vers
in the exten&s;ive capacity of the human &s;pecies,
is, that it renders our benevolence al&s;o more exten&s;ive,
and gives us large opportunities of &s;preading our
kindly influence than what are indulged to the infe|rior
creation<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Sat. XV. 139, &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE>. It mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, that by
doing good only, can a man truly enjoy the advan|tages
of being eminent. His exalted &s;tation, of it|&s;elf,
but the more expo&s;es him to danger and tumult.
His &s;ole prerogative is to afford &s;helter to inferiors,
who repo&s;e them&s;elves under his cover and pro|tection.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28">
BUT I forget, that it is not my pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to
recommend genero&s;ity and benevolence, or to paint,
in their true colours, all the genuine charms of the
&s;ocial virtues. The&s;e, indeed, &s;ufficiently engage every
heart, on the fir&s;t apprehen&s;ion of them; and 'tis dif|ficult
to ab&s;tain from &s;ome &s;ally of panegyric, as often
as they occur in di&s;cour&s;e or rea&s;oning. But our ob|ject
here being more the &s;peculative, than the practi|cal
part of morals, it will &s;uffice to remark, (what
will readily, I believe, be allowed) that no qualities
are more intitled to the general good-will and appro|bation
of mankind, than beneficence and humanity,
friend&s;hip and gratitude, natural affection and public
&s;pirit, or whatever proceeds from a tender &s;ympathy
with others, and a generous concern for our kind and
&s;pecies. The&s;e, wherever they appear, &s;eem to tran&s;|fu&s;e
them&s;elves, in a manner, into each beholder, and
to call forth, in their own behalf, the &s;ame favourable
and affectionate &s;entiments, which they exert on all

<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, that in di&s;playing the prai&s;es of
any humane, beneficent man, there is one circum&s;tance
which never fails to be amply in&s;i&s;ted on, <HI>viz.</HI> the
happine&s;s and &s;atisfaction, derived to &s;ociety from his
intercour&s;e and good offices. To his parents, we are
apt to &s;ay, he endears him&s;elf by his pious attach|ment
<PB N="25" REF="29">
and duteous care, &s;till more than by the con|nexions
of nature. His children never feel his autho|rity,
but when employed for their advantage. With
him, the ties of love are con&s;olidated by beneficence
and friend&s;hip. The ties of friend&s;hip approach, in a
fond ob&s;ervance of each obliging office, to tho&s;e of
love and inclination. His dome&s;tics and dependants
have in him a &s;ure re&s;ource; and no longer dread the
power of fortune, but &s;o far as &s;he exerci&s;es it over
him. From him the hungry receive food, the naked
cloathing, the ignorant and &s;lothful &s;kill and indu&s;|try.
Like the &s;un, an inferior mini&s;ter of providence,
he cheers, invigorates, and &s;u&s;tains the &s;urrounding
world.</P>
<P>IF confined to private life, the &s;phere of his acti|vity
is narrower; but his influence is all benign and
gentle. If exalted into a higher &s;tation, mankind and
po&s;terity reap the fruit of his labours.</P>
<P>As the&s;e topics of prai&s;e never fail to be employed,
and with &s;ucce&s;s, where we would in&s;pire e&s;teem for
any one; may it not thence be concluded, that the
UTILITY, re&s;ulting from the &s;ocial virtues, forms,
at lea&s;t, a <HI>part</HI> of their merit, and is one &s;ource of
that approbation and regard &s;o univer&s;ally paid them.</P>
<P>WHEN we recommend even an animal or plant as
<HI>u&s;eful</HI> and <HI>beneficial,</HI> we give it an applau&s;e and re|commendation
<PB N="26" REF="30">
&s;uited to its nature. As on the other
hand, reflection on the baneful influence of any of
the&s;e inferior beings always in&s;pires us with the &s;en|timent

<P>GIVING alms to common beggars is naturally
prai&s;ed; becau&s;e it &s;eems to carry relief to the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed

<P><HI>Tyrannicide,</HI> or the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of u&s;urpers and op|pre&s;&s;ive

becau&s;e it both freed mankind from many of the&s;e

<P>LIBERALITY in princes is regarded as a mark of

better lo&s;t than mi&s;employed after that manner.</P>
<P>LUXURY, or a refinement on the plea&s;ures and

&s;ource of every corruption in government, and the
immediate cau&s;e of faction, &s;edition, civil wars, and
the total lo&s;s of liberty. It was, therefore, univer&s;ally

be u&s;ed by the inhabitants, and the former be found,
with difficulty, and in very &s;mall quantities.</P>
<P>AGAIN; &s;uppo&s;e, that, tho' the nece&s;&s;ities of hu|man

be &s;u&s;pended by &s;uch an exten&s;ive benevolence, nor
<PB N="34" REF="38">
would the divi&s;ions and barriers of property and obli|gation
have ever been thought of. Why &s;hould I

good-office; when I know he is already prompted, by
the &s;tronge&s;t inclination, to &s;eek my happine&s;s, and

the hurt, he thereby receives, be greater than
the benefit accruing to me? In which ca&s;e, he knows,
that from my innate humanity and friend&s;hip. I &s;hould
be the fir&s;t to oppo&s;e my&s;elf to his imprudent gene|ro&s;ity.
Why rai&s;e land-marks between my neigh|bour's
field and mine, when my heart has made no
divi&s;ion between our intere&s;ts; but &s;hares all his joys
and &s;orrows with equal force and vivacity as if origi|nally
my own; Every man, upon this &s;uppo&s;ition,
being a &s;econd-&s;elf to another, would tru&s;t all his in|tere&s;ts
to the di&s;cretion of every man; without jea|lou&s;y,
without partition, without di&s;tinction. And
the whole race of mankind would form only one fa|mily;
where all would lie in common, and be u&s;ed,
freely, without regard to property; but cautiou&s;ly
too, with as entire regard to the nece&s;&s;ities of each
individual, as if our own intere&s;ts were mo&s;t inti|mately
concerned.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the human heart, it
would, perhaps, be difficult to find compleat in&s;tances
of &s;uch enlarged affections; but &s;till we may ob&s;erve,
that the ca&s;e of families approaches towards it; and
<PB N="35" REF="39">
the &s;tronger the mutual benevolence is among the in|dividuals,
the nearer it approaches; 'till all di&s;tinction
of property be, in a great mea&s;ure, lo&s;t and confound|ed
among them. Between married per&s;ons, the ce|ment
of friend&s;hip is by the laws &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o &s;trong
as to aboli&s;h all divi&s;ion of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions; and has often,
in reality, the force a&s;cribed to it. And 'tis ob&s;erv|able,
that, during the ardour of new enthu&s;ia&s;ms,
where every principle is inflamed into extravagance,
the community of goods has frequently been attempt|ed;
and nothing but experience of its inconvenien|cies,
from the returning or di&s;gui&s;ed &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of
men, could make the imprudent fanatics adopt a-new
the ideas of ju&s;tice and of &s;eparate property. So true
is it, that that virtue derives its exi&s;tence entirely from
its nece&s;&s;ary <HI>u&s;e</HI> to the intercour&s;e and &s;ocial &s;tate of
mankind.</P>
<P>To make this truth more evident, let us rever&s;e the
foregoing &s;uppo&s;itions; and carrying every thing to
the oppo&s;ite extreme, con&s;ider what would be the ef|fect
of tho&s;e new &s;ituations. Suppo&s;e a &s;ociety to
fall into &s;uch want of all common nece&s;&s;aries, that
the utmo&s;t frugality and indu&s;try cannot pre&s;erve the
greate&s;t number from peri&s;hing, and the whole from
extreme &s;ufferance: It will readily, I believe, be ad|mitted,
that the &s;trict laws of ju&s;tice are &s;u&s;pended,
in &s;uch a pre&s;&s;ing emergence, and give place to the
&s;tronger motives of nece&s;&s;ity and &s;elf pre&s;ervation. Is
<PB N="36" REF="40">
it any crime, after a &s;hipwreck, to &s;eize whatever
means or in&s;trument of &s;afety one can lay hold of,
without regard to former limitations of property?
Or if a city be&s;ieged were peri&s;hing with hunger;
can we imagine, that men will &s;ee any means of pre|&s;ervation
before them, and lo&s;e their lives, from a
&s;erupulous regard to what, in other &s;ituations, would
be the rules of equity and ju&s;tice? The USE and
TENDENCY of that virtue is to procure happine&s;s
and &s;ecurity, by pre&s;erving order in &s;ociety: But
where the &s;ociety is ready to peri&s;h from extreme ne|ce&s;&s;ity,
$o greater evil can be dreaded from violence
and inju&s;tice; and every man may now provide for
him&s;elf, by all the means, which prudence can dic|tate,
or humanity permit. The public, even in le&s;s
urgent nece&s;&s;ities, opens granaries, without the con|&s;ent
of proprietors; as ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ing, that the au|thority
of magi&s;tracy may, con&s;i&s;tent with equity,
extend &s;o far: But were any number of men to a&s;|&s;emble,
without the tye of laws or civil juri&s;diction;
would an equal partition of bread in a famine, even
without the proprietor's con&s;ent, be regarded as cri|minal
or injurious?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE likewi&s;e, that it &s;hould be a virtuous
man's fate to fall into the &s;ociety of ruffians, remote
from the protection of laws and government; what
conduct mu&s;t he embrace in that melancholy &s;ituati|en?
He &s;ees &s;uch a de&s;perate rapaciou&s;ne&s;s prevail;
<PB N="37" REF="41">
&s;uch a di&s;regard to equity, &s;uch contempt of order,
&s;uch &s;tupid blindne&s;s to future con&s;equences, as mu&s;t
immediately have the mo&s;t tragical conclu&s;ion, and
mu&s;t terminate in de&s;truction to the greater number,
and in a total di&s;&s;olution of &s;ociety to the re&s;t. He,
mean while, can have no other expedient than to arm
him&s;elf, to whomever the &s;word he &s;eizes, or the
buckler may belong: To make provi&s;ion of all means
of defence and &s;ecurity: And his particular regard to
ju&s;tice being no longer of USE to his own &s;afety or
that of others, he mu&s;t con&s;ult alone the dictates of
&s;elf-pre&s;ervation, without concern for tho&s;e who no
longer merit his care and attention.</P>
<P>WHEN any man, even in political &s;ociety, renders
him&s;elf, by his crimes, obnoxious to the public, he
is puni&s;hed by the laws in his goods and per&s;on;
that is, the ordinary rules of ju&s;tice are, with regard
to him, &s;u&s;pended for a moment, and it becomes
equitable to inflict on him, for the <HI>benefit</HI> of &s;ociety,
what, otherwife, he could not &s;uffer without wrong
or injury.</P>
<P>THE rage and violence of public war; what is it
but a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of ju&s;tice among the warring parties,
who perceive, that that virtue is now no longer of
any <HI>u&s;e</HI> or advantage to them? The laws of war,
which then &s;ucceed to tho&s;e of equity and ju&s;tice, are
rules calculated for the <HI>advantage</HI> and <HI>utility</HI> of that
<PB N="38" REF="42">
particular &s;tate, in which men are now placed. And
were a civilized nation engaged with barbarians, who
ob&s;erved no rules even of war; the former mu&s;t al&s;o
&s;u&s;pend their ob&s;ervance of them, where they no
longer &s;erve to any purpo&s;e; and mu&s;t render every
action or rencounter as bloody and pernicious as po&s;|&s;ible
to the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>THUS the rules of equity or ju&s;tice depend entirely
on the particular &s;tate and condition, in which men
are placed, and owe their origin and exi&s;tence to that
UTILITY, which re&s;ults to the public from their
&s;trict and regular ob&s;ervance. Rever&s;e, in any con|&s;iderable
circum&s;tance, the condition of men: Pro|duce
extreme abundance or extreme nece&s;&s;ity: Im|plant
in the human brea&s;t perfect moderation and hu|manity,
or perfect rapaciou&s;ne&s;s and malice: By ren|dering
ju&s;tice totally <HI>u&s;ele&s;s,</HI> you thereby totally de|&s;troy
its e&s;&s;ence, and &s;u&s;pend its obligation upon
mankind.</P>
<P>THE common &s;ituation of &s;ociety is a medium
amid&s;t all the&s;e extremes. We are naturally partial to
our&s;elves, and to our friends; but are capable of
learning the advantage re&s;ulting from a more equitable
conduct. Few enjoyments are given us from the open
and liberal hand of nature; but by art, labour, and
indu&s;try, we can extract them in great abundance.
<PB N="39" REF="43">
Hence the ideas of property become nece&s;&s;ary in all
civil &s;ociety: Hence ju&s;tice derives its u&s;efulne&s;s to the
public: And hence alone ari&s;es its merit and moral
obligation.</P>
<P>THESE conclu&s;ions are &s;o natural and obvious, that
they have not e&s;caped even the poets, in their de|&s;criptions
of the felicity, attending the golden age or
the reign of SATURN. The &s;ea&s;ons, in that fir&s;t pe|riod
of nature, were &s;o temperate, if we credit the&s;e
agreeable fictions, that there was no nece&s;&s;ity for men
to provide them&s;elves with cloaths and hou&s;es, as a
&s;ecurity again&s;t the violence of heat and cold: The
rivers flowed with wine and milk: The oaks yielded
honey; and nature &s;pontaneou&s;ly produced her great|e&s;t
delicacies. Nor were the&s;e the chief advantages
of that happy age. Tempe&s;ts were not alone removed
from nature; but tho&s;e more furious tempe&s;ts were
unknown to human brea&s;ts, which now cau&s;e &s;uch up|roar,
and engender &s;uch confu&s;ion. Avarice, ambi|tion,
cruelty, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, were never heard of: Cor|dial
affection, compa&s;&s;ion, &s;ympathy, were the only
movements with which the mind was yet acquainted.
Even the punctilious di&s;tinction of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine</HI> was
bani&s;hed from among that happy race of mortals, and
carried with it the very notion of property and obli|gation,
ju&s;tice and inju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44">

the origin here a&s;&s;igned for the virtue of ju&s;tice is
real and &s;atisfactory.</P>
<P>WERE there a &s;pecies of creatures, intermingled
with men, which, tho' rational, were po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;uch
inferior &s;trength, both of body and mind, that they

to give gentle u&s;age to the&s;e creatures, but
&s;hould not, properly &s;peaking, lie under any re&s;traint
of ju&s;tice with regard to them, nor could they po&s;&s;e&s;s
any right or property, exclu&s;ive of &s;uch arbitrary
lords. Our intercourfe with them could not be called
&s;ociety, which &s;uppo&s;es a degree of equality; but ab|&s;olute
command on the one &s;ide, and &s;ervile obedi|ence
on the other. Whatever we covet, they mu&s;t
in&s;tantly re&s;ign: Our permi&s;&s;ion is the only tenure,
by which they hold their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions: Our compa&s;&s;ion

<P>THIS is plainly the &s;ituation of men, with regard
to animals; and how far the&s;e may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s
rea&s;on, I leave it to others to determine. The great
&s;uperiority of civilized EUROPEANS above barbarous
INDIANS, tempted us to imagine our&s;elves on the
&s;ame footing with regard to them, and made us throw
off all re&s;traints of ju&s;tice, and even of humanity, in
our treatment of them. In many nations, the female
&s;ex are reduced to like &s;lavery, and are rendered in|capable
of all property, in oppo&s;ition to their lordly
ma&s;ters. But tho' the males, when united, have, in all
countries, bodily force &s;ufficient to maintain this &s;e|vere
tyranny; yet &s;uch are the in&s;inuation, addre&s;s,
and charms of their fair companions, that they are
commonly able to break the confederacy, and &s;hare

&s;ociety.</P>

Where mutual regards and forbearance &s;erve
no manner of purpo&s;e, they would never direct the
conduct of any rea&s;onable man. The headlong cour&s;e
of the pa&s;&s;ions would be checked by no reflection on

<P>IF we examine the <HI>particular</HI> laws, by which ju&s;|tice
is directed, and property determined; we &s;hall
&s;till be pre&s;ented with the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. The good
of mankind is the only object of all the&s;e laws and
regulations. Not only 'tis requi&s;ite for the peace and
intere&s;t of &s;ociety, that men's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;hould be
&s;eparated; but the rules, which we follow, in making
the &s;eparation, are &s;uch as can be&s;t be contrived to
&s;erve farther the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, that a creature, po&s;&s;e&s;t of rea|&s;on,
but unacquainted with human nature, delibe|rates
with him&s;elf what RULES of ju&s;tice or property
would be&s;t promote public intere&s;t, and e&s;tabli&s;h peace
and &s;ecurity among mankind: His mo&s;t obvious
thought would be, to a&s;&s;ign the large&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to
the mo&s;t exten&s;ive virtue, and give every one the
power of doing good, proportioned to his inclination.
In a perfect theocracy, where a being, infinitely in|telligent,
governs by particular volitions, this rule
would certainly have place and might &s;erve the wi&s;e&s;t
purpo&s;es: But were mankind to execute &s;uch a law;
<PB N="46" REF="50">
(&s;o great is the uncertainty of merit, both from its
natural ob&s;curity, and from the &s;elf-conceit of each
individual) that no determinate rule of conduct would
ever re&s;ult from it; and the total di&s;&s;olution of &s;o|ciety
mu&s;t be the immediate con&s;equence. Fanatics
may &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>that dominion is founded on grace,</HI> and
<HI>that &s;aints alone inherit the earth;</HI> but the civil magi|&s;trate
very ju&s;tly puts the&s;e &s;ublime theori&s;ts on the
&s;ame footing with common robbers, and teaches them,
by the &s;evere&s;t di&s;cipline, that a rule, which, in &s;pe|culation,
may &s;eem the mo&s;t advantageous to &s;ociety,
may yet be found, in practice, totally pernicious and
de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THAT there were <HI>religious</HI> fanatics of this kind in
ENGLAND, during the civil wars, we learn from hi&s;|tory;
tho' 'tis probable, that the obvious <HI>tendency</HI>
of the&s;e principles excited &s;uch horror in mankind, as
&s;oon obliged the dangerous enthu&s;ia&s;ts to renounce,
or at lea&s;t conceal their tenets. Perhaps, the <HI>level|lers,</HI>
who claimed an equal di&s;tribution of property,
were a kind of <HI>political</HI> fanatics, which aro&s;e from
the religious &s;pecies, and more openly avowed their
preten&s;ions; as carrying a more plau&s;ible appear|ance,
of being practicable in them&s;elves, as well as
u&s;eful to human &s;ociety.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, indeed, be confe&s;&s;ed, that nature is &s;o
liberal to mankind, that were all her pre&s;ents equally
<PB N="47" REF="51">
divided among the &s;pecies, and improved by art
and indu&s;try, every individual would enjoy all the
nece&s;&s;aries, and even mo&s;t of the comforts of life;
nor would ever be liable to any ills, but &s;uch as
might accidentally ari&s;e from the &s;ickly frame and
con&s;titution of his body. It mu&s;t al&s;o be confe&s;&s;ed,
that, wherever we depart from this equality, we rob
the poor of more &s;atisfaction than we add to the
rich, and that the &s;light gratification of a frivolous
vanity, in one individual, frequently co&s;ts more than
bread to many families, and even provinces. It may
appear withal, that the rule of equality, as it would
be highly <HI>u&s;eful,</HI> is not altogether <HI>impracticable;</HI> but
has taken place, at lea&s;t, in an imperfect degree, in
&s;ome republics; particularly that of SPARTA; where
it was attended, as 'tis &s;aid, with the mo&s;t beneficial
con&s;equences. Not to mention, that the AGRARIAN
laws, &s;o frequently claimed in ROME, and carried to
execution in many GREEK cities, proceeded, all of
them, from a general idea of the utility of this prin|ciple.</P>
<P>BUT hi&s;torians, and even common &s;en&s;e, may in|form
us, that however &s;pecious the&s;e ideas of <HI>perfect</HI>
equality may &s;eem, they are really, at the bottom,
<HI>impracticable;</HI> and were they not &s;o, would be ex|tremely
<HI>pernicious</HI> to human &s;ociety. Render po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions
ever &s;o equal, men's different degrees of art,
care, and indu&s;try, will immediately break that equa|lity.
<PB N="48" REF="52">
Or if you check the&s;e virtues, you reduce &s;o|ciety
to the extreme&s;t indigence; and in&s;tead of pre|venting
want and beggary in a few, render it una|voidable
to the whole community. The mo&s;t rigorous
inqui&s;ition too, is requi&s;ite to watch every inequality
on its fir&s;t appearance; and the mo&s;t &s;evere juri&s;dic|tion,
to puni&s;h and redre&s;s it. But be&s;ides, that &s;o
much authority mu&s;t &s;oon degenerate into tyranny,
and be exerted with great partialities; who can po&s;|&s;ibly
be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as is here
&s;uppo&s;ed? Perfect equality of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, de&s;troying
all &s;ubordination, weakens extremely the authority of
magi&s;tracy, and mu&s;t reduce all power nearly to a
level, as well as property.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in order to
e&s;tabli&s;h laws for the regulation of property, we mu&s;t
be acquainted with the nature and &s;ituation of man;
mu&s;t reject appearances, which may be fal&s;e, tho'
&s;pecious; and mu&s;t &s;earch for tho&s;e rules, which are,
on the whole, mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful</HI> and <HI>beneficial.</HI> Vulgar
&s;en&s;e and &s;light experience are &s;ufficient for this pur|po&s;e;
where men give not way to too &s;elfi&s;h avidity,
or too exten&s;ive enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>WHO &s;ees not, for in&s;tance, that whatever is pro|duced
or improved by a man's art or indu&s;try ought,
for ever, to be &s;ecured to him, in order to give en|couragement
to &s;uch <HI>u&s;eful</HI> habits and accompli&s;h|ments?
<PB N="49" REF="53">
That the property ought al&s;o to de&s;cend to
children and relations, for the &s;ame <HI>u&s;eful</HI> purpo&s;e?
That it may be alienated by con&s;ent, in order to be|get
that commerce and intercour&s;e, which is &s;o <HI>bene|ficial</HI>
to human &s;ociety? And that all contracts and
promi&s;es ought carefully to be fulfilled, in order to
&s;ecure mutual tru&s;t and confidence, by which the ge|neral
<HI>intere&s;t</HI> of mankind is &s;o much promoted?</P>
<P>EXAMINE the writers on the laws of nature; and
you will always find, that, whatever principles they
&s;et out with, they are &s;ure to terminate here at la&s;t,
and to a&s;&s;ign, as the ultimate rea&s;on for every rule
which they e&s;tabli&s;h, the convenience and nece&s;&s;ities
of mankind. A conce&s;&s;ion thus extorted, in oppo&s;i|tion
to &s;y&s;tems, has more authority, than if it had
been made, in pro&s;ecution of them.</P>
<P>WHAT other rea&s;on, indeed, could writers ever
give, why this mu&s;t be <HI>mine</HI> and that <HI>yours;</HI> &s;ince un|in&s;tructed
nature, &s;urely, never made any &s;uch di&s;tinc|tion?
The&s;e objects are, of them&s;elves, foreign to
us; they are totally disjoined and &s;eparated from us;
and nothing but the general intere&s;ts of &s;ociety can
form the connection.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety may require a
rule of ju&s;tice in a particular ca&s;e; but may not deter|mine
any particular rule, among &s;everal, which are
all equally beneficial. In that ca&s;e, the &s;lighte&s;t <HI>ana|logies</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="54">
are laid hold of, in order to prevent that indif|ference
and ambiguity, which would be the &s;ource of
perpetual di&s;&s;entions. Thus po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion alone, and fir&s;t
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, is &s;uppo&s;ed to convey property, where no|body
el&s;e has any precedent claim and preten&s;ion.
Many of the rea&s;onings of lawyers are of this analo|gical
nature, and depend on very &s;light connexions
of the imagination.</P>
<P>DOES any one &s;cruple, in extraordinary ca&s;es, to vi|olate
all regard to the private property of individuals,
and &s;acrifice to public intere&s;t a di&s;tinction, which
had been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ake of that intere&s;t?
The &s;afety of the people is the &s;upreme law: All
other particular laws are &s;ubordinate to it, and depen|dant
on it: And if, in the <HI>common</HI> cour&s;e of things,
they be followed and regarded; 'tis only becau&s;e the
public &s;afety and intere&s;t, <HI>commonly</HI> demand &s;o equal
and impartial an admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES both <HI>utility</HI> and <HI>analogy</HI> fail, and leave
the laws of ju&s;tice in total uncertainty. Thus, 'tis
highly requi&s;ite, that pre&s;cription or long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
&s;hould convey property; but what number of days or
months or years &s;hould be &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e,
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for rea&s;on alone to dermine. <HI>Civil laws</HI>
here &s;upply the place of the natural <HI>code,</HI> and a&s;&s;ign
different terms for pre&s;cription, according to the dif|ferent
<HI>utilities,</HI> propo&s;ed by the legi&s;lator. Bills of
<PB N="51" REF="55">
exchange and promi&s;&s;ory notes, by the laws of mo&s;t
countries, pre&s;cribe &s;ooner than bonds and mortgages,
and contracts of a more formal nature.</P>
<P>IN general we may ob&s;erve, that all que&s;tions of
property are &s;ubordinate to the authority of civil laws,
which extend, re&s;train, modify, and alter the rules of
natural ju&s;tice, according to the particular <HI>convenience</HI>
of each community. The laws have, or ought to
have, a con&s;tant reference to the con&s;titution of go|vernment,
the manners, the climate, the religion, the
commerce, the &s;ituation of each &s;ociety. A late au|thor
of genius, as well as learning, has pro&s;ecuted
this &s;ubject at large, and has e&s;tablished, from the&s;e
principles, a &s;y&s;tem of political knowledge, which
abounds in ingenious and brilliant thoughts, and is
not wanting in &s;olidity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of <HI>L'E&s;prit des Loix.</HI> This illu&s;trious writer, however, &s;ets out with a different theory, and &s;uppo&s;es all right to be founded on certain <HI>rapports</HI> or relations; which is a &s;y&s;tem, that, in my opinion, never will reconcile with true phi|lo&s;ophy. Father MALERRANCHE, as far as I can learn, was the fir&s;t that &s;tarted&punc; this ab&s;tract theory of morals, which was afterwards adopted by Dr. CLARKE and others; and as it ex|cludes all &s;entiment, and pretends to found every thing on rea|&s;on, it has not wanted followers in this philo&s;ophic age. See Section 1. and Appendix I. With regard to ju&s;tice, the virtue here treated of, the inference again&s;t this theory &s;eems &s;hort and conclu&s;ive. Property is allowed to be dependant on civil laws; civil laws are allowed to have no other foundation of their au|thority, and no other object, but the intere&s;t of &s;ociety: This therefore mu&s;t be allowed to be the &s;ole foundation of property and ju&s;tice. Not to mention, that our obligation it&s;elf to obey the magi&s;trate and his laws is founded on nothing but the inter|e&s;ts of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If the ideas of ju&s;tice, &s;ometimes, do not follow the di&s;po|&s;itions of eivil law; we &s;hall find, that the&s;e ca&s;es, in&s;tead of ob|jections, are confirmations of the theory delivered above. Where a civil law is &s;o perver&s;e as to cro&s;s all the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, it lo&s;es all its authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural ju&s;tice, which are conformable to tho&s;e intere&s;ts. Sometimes al&s;o civil laws, for u&s;eful purpo&s;es, require a ceremony or form; and where that is wanting, their decrees run contrary to the u&s;ual tenor of ju&s;tice; but one, who takes advantage of &s;uch chi|$anes, is not regarded as an hone&s;t man. Thus, the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety require, that contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material article either of natural or civil ju&s;tice: But the omi&s;&s;ion of a trifling circum&s;tance will often, by law, invalidate a contract, <HI>in fero bumano,</HI> but not <HI>in foro con&s;cientiae,</HI> as divines expre&s;s them&s;elves. In the&s;e ca&s;es, the magi&s;trate is &s;uppo&s;ed only to withdraw his power of inforcing the right, not to have altered the right. Where his intention extends to the right, and is conformable to the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety; it never fails to alter the right; a clear proof of the origin of ju&s;tice and of pro|perty, as a&s;&s;igned above.</P></NOTE>.</P>

original in&s;tinct, and is not a&s;certained by any
argument or reflection. But who is there that ever
heard of &s;uch an in&s;tinct? Or is this a &s;ubject, in
which new di&s;coveries will be made? We may as
well expect to di&s;cover, in the body, new &s;en&s;es,
which had before e&s;caped all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62">
BUT farther, tho' it &s;eems a very &s;imple propo&s;ition
to &s;ay, that nature, by an in&s;tinctive &s;entiment, di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
property, yet in reality we &s;hall find, that
there are required for that purpo&s;e ten thou&s;and dif|ferent
in&s;tincts, and the&s;e employed about objects of
the greate&s;t intricacy and nice&s;t di&s;cernment. For
when a definition of <HI>property</HI> is demanded, that relation
is found to re&s;olve it&s;elf into any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion acquired
by occupation, by indu&s;try, by pre&s;cription, by inhe|ritance,
by contract, &amp;c. Can we think, that na|ture,
by an original in&s;tinct, in&s;tructs us in all the&s;e
methods of acqui&s;ition?
THESE words too, inheritance and contract, &s;tand
for ideas infinitely complicated; and to define them
exactly, a thou&s;and volumes of laws, and innumerable
volumes of commentators, have not been found &s;uffi|cient.
Does nature, who&s;e in&s;tincts in men are all
&s;imple, embrace &s;uch complicated and artificial ob|jects,
and create a rational creature, without tru&s;ting
any thing to the operation of his rea&s;on?
BUT even tho' all this were admitted, it would not
be &s;atisfactory. Po&s;itive laws can certainly transfer
property. Is it by another original in&s;tinct, that we
recognize the authority of kings and &s;enates, and
mark all the boundaries of their juri&s;diction? Judges
too, even tho' their &s;entence be erroneous and illegal,
mu&s;t be allowed, for the &s;ake of peace and order, to
<PB N="59" REF="63">
have deci&s;ive authority, and ultimately to determine
property. Have we original, innate ideas of praetors
and chancellors and juries? Who &s;ees not, that all
the&s;e in&s;titutions ari&s;e merely from the nece&s;&s;ities of
human &s;ociety?</P>
<P>ALL birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies, in every age and
country, build their ne&s;ts alike: In this we &s;ee the
force of in&s;tinct. Men, in different times and places,
frame their hou&s;es differently: Here we perceive the
influence of rea&s;on and cu&s;tom. A like inference may
be drawn from comparing the in&s;tinct of generation
and the in&s;titution of property.</P>
<P>HOWEVER great the variety of municipal laws, it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that their great lines pretty regu|larly
concur; becau&s;e the purpo&s;es, to which they tend,
are every where exactly &s;imilar. In like manner, all
hou&s;es have a roof and walls, and windows and chim|neys;
tho' infinitely diver&s;ified in their &s;hape, figure,
and materials. The purpo&s;es of the latter, directed to
the conveniencies of human life, be&s;peak not more
plainly their origin from rea&s;on and reflection, than
do tho&s;e of the former, which point all to a like end.</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the variations which all the
rules of property receive from the finer turns and con|nexions
of the imagination, and from the &s;ubtilties
and ab&s;tractions of law-topics and rea&s;onings. There
<PB N="60" REF="64">
is no po&s;&s;ibility of reconciling this ob&s;ervation to the
notion of original in&s;tincts.</P>
<P>WHAT alone will beget a doubt of the theory, on
which I in&s;i&s;t, is the influence of education and ac|quired
habits, by which we are &s;o accu&s;tomed to
blame inju&s;tice, that we are not, in every in&s;tance,
con&s;cious of any immediate reflection on the perni|cious
con&s;equences of it. The views the mo&s;t fami|liar
to us are apt, for that very rea&s;on, to e&s;cape us;
and what we have very frequently performed from
certain motives, we are apt likewi&s;e to continue me|chanically,
without recalling, on every occa&s;ion, the
reflections, which fir&s;t determined us. The conve|nience,
or rather nece&s;&s;ity, which leads to ju&s;tice, is &s;o
univer&s;al, and every where points &s;o much to the &s;ame
rules, that the habit takes place in all &s;ocieties; and
it is not without &s;ome &s;crutiny, that we are able to
a&s;certain its true origin. The matter, however, is
not &s;o ob&s;cure, but that, even in common life, we
have, every moment, recour&s;e to the principle of pub|lic
utility, and a&s;k, <HI>What mu&s;t become of the world, if
&s;uch practices prevail? How could &s;ociety &s;ub&s;i&s;t under
&s;uch di&s;orders?</HI> Were the di&s;tinction or &s;eparation of
po&s;&s;effions intirely u&s;ele&s;s, can any one conceive, that
it ever &s;hould have obtained in &s;ociety?</P>
<P>THUS we &s;eem, upon the whole, to have attained
a knowlege of the force of that principle here in&s;i&s;ted
<PB N="61" REF="65">
on, and can determine what degree of e&s;teem or mo|ral
approbation may re&s;ult from reflections on public
intere&s;t and utility. The nece&s;&s;ity of ju&s;tice to the
&s;upport of &s;ociety is the SOLE foundation of that
virtue; and &s;ince no moral excellence is more highly
e&s;teemed, we may conclude, that this circum&s;tance of
u&s;efulne&s;s has, in general, the &s;tronge&s;t energy, and
mo&s;t intire command over our &s;entiments. It mu&s;t,
therefore, be the &s;ource of a con&s;iderable part of the
merit a&s;cribed to humanity, benevolence, friend&s;hip,
public &s;pirit, and other &s;ocial virtues of that &s;tamp;
as it is the SOLE &s;ource of the moral approbation
paid to fidelity, ju&s;tice, veracity, integrity, and tho&s;e
other e&s;timable and u&s;eful qualities and principles.
'Tis intirely agreeable to the rules of philo&s;ophy, and
even of common rea&s;on; where any principle has

<P>HAD every man &s;ufficient <HI>&s;agacity</HI> to perceive, at
all times, the &s;trong intere&s;t, which binds him
to the ob&s;ervance of ju&s;tice and equity, and <HI>&s;trength

a general and a di&s;tant intere&s;t, in oppo&s;ition to the
allurements of pre&s;ent plea&s;ure and advantage: There
had never, in that ca&s;e, been any &s;uch thing as go|vernment
or political &s;ociety, but each man following
his natural liberty, had lived in intire peace and har|mony
with all others. What need of po&s;itive laws,
where natural ju&s;tice is, of it&s;elf, a &s;ufficient re&s;traint?
Why create magi&s;trates, where there never ari&s;es any
di&s;order or iniquity? Why abridge our native free|dom,
when, in every in&s;tance, the utmo&s;t exertion of
it is found innocent and beneficial? 'Tis evident,
that, if government were totally u&s;ele&s;s, it never could
have place, and that the SOLE foundation of the
duty of ALLEGIANCE is the <HI>advantage</HI> which
<PB N="64" REF="67">
it procures to &s;ociety, by pre&s;erving peace and order
among mankind.</P>
<P>WHEN a number of political &s;ocieties are erected,
and maintain a great intercour&s;e together, a new &s;et
of rules are immediately di&s;covered to be <HI>u&s;eful</HI> in that
particular &s;ituation; and accordingly take place, un|der
the title of LAWS of NATIONS. Of this
kind are, the &s;acredne&s;s of the per&s;ons of amba&s;&s;adors,
ab&s;taining from poi&s;oned arms, quarter in war, with
others of that kind, which are plainly calculated for
the <HI>advantage</HI> of &s;tates and kingdoms, in their inter|cour&s;e
with each other.</P>
<P>THE rules of ju&s;tice, &s;uch as prevail among indi|viduals,
are not intirely &s;u&s;pended among political &s;o|cieties.
All princes pretend a regard to the rights of
others; and &s;ome, no doubt, without hypocri&s;y. Al|liances
and treaties are every day made between inde|pendent
&s;tates, which would only be &s;o much wa&s;te of
parchment, if they were not found, by experience, to
have <HI>&s;ome</HI> influence and authority. But here is the
difference between kingdoms and individuals. Hu|man
nature cannot, by any means, &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without
the a&s;&s;ociation of individuals; and that a&s;&s;ociation ne|ver
could have place, were no regard paid to the laws
of equity and ju&s;tice. Di&s;order, confu&s;ion, the war
of all again&s;t all, are the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of
&s;uch a licentious conduct. But nations can &s;ub&s;i&s;t
<PB N="65" REF="68">
without intercour&s;e. They may even &s;ub&s;i&s;t, in &s;ome
degree, under a general war. The ob&s;ervance of
ju&s;tice, tho' u&s;eful among them, is not guarded by &s;o
&s;trong a nece&s;&s;ity as among individuals; and the <HI>moral
obligation</HI> holds proportion with the <HI>u&s;efulne&s;s.</HI> All
politicians will allow, and mo&s;t philo&s;ophers, that
REASONS of STATE may, in particular emer|gencies,
di&s;pen&s;e with the rules of ju&s;tice, and invali|date
any treaty or alliance, where the &s;trict ob&s;ervance
of it would be prejudicial, in a confiderable degree, to
either of the contracting parties. But nothing le&s;s
than the extreme&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, 'tis confe&s;t, can ju&s;tify
individuals in a breach of promi&s;e, or an inva&s;ion of
the properties of others.</P>
<P>IN a con&s;ederated commonwealth, &s;uch as the A|CH$AN
republic of old, or the SWI$S Cantons and
United Provinces in modern times; as the league has
here a peculiar <HI>utility,</HI> the conditions of union have a
peculiar &s;acredne&s;s and authority, and a violation of
them would be equally criminal, or even more crimi|nal,
than any private injury or inju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THE long and helple&s;s infancy of man requires
the combination of parents for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their
young; and that combination requires the virtue of
CHASTITY or fidelity to the marriage$ bed.
Without &s;uch an <HI>utility,</HI> it will readily be owned,
<PB N="66" REF="69">

<P>AN infidelity of this nature is much more <HI>pernicious</HI>

'Tis a vulgar story at PARIS, that during the rage of the MIS|SISSIPPI, a hump-backed fellow went every day into the RUE DE QUINCEMPOIX, where the &s;tock-jobbers met in great crowds, and was well paid for allowing them to make u&s;e of his hump as a de&s;k, in order to &s;ign their contracts upon it. Would the fortune which he rai&s;ed by this invention make him a hand&s;ome fellow; tho' it be confe&s;t, that per&s;onal beauty ari|&s;es very much from ideas of utility? The imagination is in|fluenced by a&s;&s;ociations of ideas; which, tho' they ari&s;e at fir&s;t from the judgment, are not ea&s;ily altered by every particular ex|ception that occurs to us. To which we may add, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e of cha&s;tity, that the example of the old would be pernicious to the young; and that women continually thinking that a cer|tain time would bring them the liberty of indulgence, would na|turally advance that period, and think more lightly of this whole duty, &s;o requi&s;ite to &s;ociety.</NOTE>.</P>

THOSE who live in the &s;ame family have &s;o fre|quent

cu&s;tom. INCEST, therefore, being <HI>pernicious</HI> in
a &s;uperior degree, has al&s;o a &s;uperior turpitude and
moral deformity annexed to it.</P>
<P>WHAT is the rea&s;on, why, by the ATHENIAN
laws, one might marry a half-&s;i&s;ter by the father, but
not by the mother? Plainly this. The manners of
the ATHENIANS were &s;o re&s;erved, that a man was
never permitted to approach the women's apartment,
even in the &s;ame family, unle&s;s where he vi&s;ited his
<PB N="68" REF="71">
own mother. His &s;tep-mother and her children were
as much &s;hut up from him as the women of any other
family, and there was as little danger of any cri|minal
corre&s;pondence between them. Uncles and
nieces, for a like rea&s;on, might marry at ATHENS;
but neither the&s;e, nor half-brothers and &s;i&s;ters, could
contract that alliance at ROME, where the intercour&s;e
was more open between the &s;exes. Public utility is
the cau&s;e of all the&s;e variations.</P>
<P>TO repeat, to a man's prejudice, any thing that
e&s;caped him in private conver&s;ation, or to make any
&s;uch u&s;e of his private letters, is highly blamed. The
free and &s;ocial intercour&s;e of minds mu&s;t be extremely
checked, where no &s;uch rules of fidelity are e&s;ta|bli&s;hed.</P>
<P>EVEN in repeating &s;tories, whence we can &s;ee no
ill con&s;equences to re&s;ult, the giving one's authors is
regarded as a piece of indi&s;cretion, if not of immo|rality.
The&s;e &s;tories, in pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand,
and receiving all the u&s;ual variations, frequently come
about to the per&s;ons concerned, and produce animo|&s;ities
and quarrels among people, who&s;e intentions
are the mo&s;t innocent and inoffen&s;ive.</P>
<P>TO pry into &s;ecrets, to open or even read the let|ters
of others, to play the &s;py upon their words and
looks and actions: what habits more inconvenient
<PB N="69" REF="72">
in &s;ociety? What habits, of con&s;equence, more
blameable?</P>
<P>THIS principle is al&s;o the foundation of mo&s;t of the
laws of good manners; a kind of le&s;&s;er morality cal|culated
for the ea&s;e of company and conver&s;ation.
Too much or too little ceremony are both blamed,
and every thing, which promotes ea&s;e, without an in|decent
familiarity, is u&s;eful and laudable.</P>
<P>CONSTANCY in friend&s;hips, attachments, and fa|miliarities,
is commonly very commendable, and is
requi&s;ite to &s;upport tru&s;t and good corre&s;pondence in
&s;ociety. But in places of general, though ca&s;ual con|cour&s;e,
where the pur&s;uit of health and plea&s;ure
brings people promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, public conve|niency
has di&s;pen&s;ed with this maxim; and cu&s;tom
there promotes an unre&s;erved conver&s;ation for the
time, by indulging the privilege of dropping after|wards
every indifferent acquaintance, without breach
of civility or good-manners.</P>
<P>EVEN in &s;ocieties, which are e&s;tabli&s;hed on prin|ciples
the mo&s;t immoral, and the mo&s;t de&s;tructive to
the intere&s;ts of the general &s;ociety, there are required
certain rules, which a &s;pecies of fal&s;e honour, as well
as private intere&s;t, engages the members to ob&s;erve.
Robbers and pyrates, it has often been remarked,
could not maintain their pernicious confederacy, did
<PB N="70" REF="73">
they not e&s;tabli&s;h a new di&s;tributive ju&s;tice among
them&s;elves, and recall tho&s;e laws of equity, which
they have violated with the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>I HATE a drinking companion, &s;ays the GREEK
proverb, who never forgets. The follies of the la&s;t de|bauch
&s;hould be buried in eternal oblivion, in order to

<P>AMONG nations, where an immoral gallantry, if
covered with a thin veil of my&s;tery, is, in &s;ome de|gree,
authorized by cu&s;tom, there immediately ari&s;e a
&s;et of rules, calculated for the conveniency of that at|tachment.
The famous court or parliament of love
in PROVENCE decided formally all difficult ca&s;es of
this nature.</P>
<P>IN &s;ocieties for play, there are laws required for the
conduct of the game, and the&s;e laws are different in
each game. The foundation, I own, of &s;uch &s;ocieties
is frivolous; and the laws are, in a great mea&s;ure,
tho' not altogether, capricious and arbitrary. So far
is there a material difference between them and the
rules of ju&s;tice, fidelity and loyalty. The general &s;o|cieties
of men are ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite for the &s;ub&s;i&s;|tence
of the &s;pecies; and the public conveniency,
which regulates morals, is inviolably e&s;tabli&s;hed in
the nature of man, and of the world, in which he
lives. The compari&s;on, therefore, in the&s;e re&s;pects,
<PB N="71" REF="74">
is very imperfect. We may only learn from it the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of rules, wherever men have any intercour&s;e
with each other.</P>
<P>THEY cannot even pa&s;s each other on the road
without rules. Waggoners, coachmen, and po&s;tilions
have principles, by which they give way; and the&s;e
are chiefly founded on mutual ea&s;e and convenience.
Sometimes al&s;o they are arbitrary, at lea&s;t dependent
on a kind of capricious analogy, like many of the
rea&s;onings of lawyers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">That the lighter machine yields to the heavier, and, in machines of the &s;ame kind, that the empty yield to the loaded: this rule is founded on convenience.

From like rea&s;ons, among foot-walkers, the right-hand intitles a man to the wall, and prevents jo&s;tling, which peaceable people find very di&s;agreeable and inconvenient.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To carry the matter farther, we may ob&s;erve, that
'tis impo&s;&s;ible for men &s;o much as to murder each
other without &s;tatutes and maxims, and an idea of
ju&s;tice and honour. War has its laws as well as
peace; and even that &s;portive kind of war carried on
among wre&s;tlers, boxers, cudgel-players, gladiators, is
regulated by fixed principles. Common intere&s;t and
utility beget infallibly a &s;tandard of right and wrong
among the parties concerned.</P>

BUT perhaps the difficulty of accounting for the&s;e
effects of u&s;efulne&s;s, or its contrary, has kept philo|&s;ophers
from admitting them into their &s;y&s;tems of
ethics, and has induced them rather to employ any
other principle, in explaining the origin of moral
good and evil. But 'tis no ju&s;t rea&s;on for rejecting
any principle, confirmed by experience, that we can|not
give a &s;atisfactory account of its origin, nor are able
to re&s;olve it into other more general principles. And
if we would employ a little thought on the pre&s;ent
&s;ubject, we need be at no lo&s;s to account for the influ|ence
of utility, and to deduce it from principles, the
mo&s;t known and avowed in human nature.</P>
<P>FROM the apparent u&s;efulne&s;s of the &s;ocial virtues,
it has readily been inferred by &s;ceptics, both ancient
and modern, that all moral di&s;tinctions ari&s;e from edu|cation,
and were, at fir&s;t, invented, and afterwards
encouraged by the art of politicians, in order to ren|der
men tractable, and &s;ubdue their natural ferocity
and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, which incapacitated them for &s;ociety.
This principle indeed of precept and education, mu&s;t
<PB N="76" REF="78">
be &s;o far owned to have a powerful influence, that it
may frequently increa&s;e or dimini&s;h, beyond their
natural &s;tandard, the &s;entiments of approbation or di&s;|like;
and may even, in particular in&s;tances, create,
without any natural principle, a new &s;entiment of this
kind; as is evident in all &s;uper&s;titious practices and
ob&s;ervances: But that <HI>all</HI> moral affection or di&s;like
ari&s;es from this origin, will never &s;urely be allowed
by any judicious inquirer Had nature made no &s;uch
di&s;tinction, founded in the original con&s;titution of the
mind, the words, <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>&s;hameful, lovely</HI> and
<HI>odious, no$le</HI> and <HI>de&s;picable,</HI> had never had place in any
language; nor could politicians, had they invented
the&s;e terms, ever have been able to render them intel|ligible,
or make them convey any idea to the audi|ence.
So that nothing can be more &s;uperficial than
this paradox of the &s;ceptics; and it were well, if&punc; in
the ab&s;tru&s;er &s;tudies of logic and metaphy&s;ics, we
could as ea&s;ily get rid of the cavils of that &s;ect, as in
the more practical and intelligible &s;ciences of politics
and morals.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial virtues mu&s;t, therefore, be allowed to
have a natural beauty and amiablene&s;s, which, at fir&s;t,
antecedent to all precept or education, recommends
them to the e&s;teem of unin&s;tructed mankind, and en|gages
their affections. And as the public utility of
the&s;e virtues is the chief circum&s;tance, whence they
derive their merit, it follows, that the end, which
<PB N="77" REF="79">
they have a tendency to promote, mu&s;t be &s;ome way
agreeable to us, and take hold of &s;ome natural affec|tion.
It mu&s;t plea&s;e, either from con&s;iderations of &s;elf-intere&s;t,
or from more generous motives and regards.</P>
<P>IT has often been a&s;&s;erted, that, as every man has a
&s;trong connexion with &s;ociety, and perceives the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of his &s;olitary &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, he becomes, on
that account, favourable to all tho&s;e habits or prin|ciples,
which promote order in &s;ociety, and in&s;ure to
him the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o ine&s;timable a ble&s;&s;ing. As
much as we value our own happine&s;s and welfare, as
much mu&s;t we value the practice of ju&s;tice and huma|nity,
by which alone the &s;ocial confederacy can be
maintained, and every man reap the fruits of mutual
protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THIS deduction of morals from &s;elf-love, or a re|gard
to private intere&s;t, is a very obvious thought, and
has not ari&s;en wholly from the wanton fallies and
&s;portive a&s;&s;aults of the &s;ceptics. To mention no
others, POLYBIUS, one of the grave&s;t and mo&s;t judi|cious,
as well as mo&s;t moral writers of antiquity, has
a&s;&s;igned this &s;elfi&s;h origin to all our &s;entiments of
virtue<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Undutifulne&s;s to parents is di&s;approved of by mankind, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

But tho' the &s;olid, practical &s;en&s;e of that
<PB N="78" REF="80">
author, and his aver&s;ion to all vain &s;ubtilties, render
his authority on the pre&s;ent &s;ubject very con&s;iderable;
yet this is not an affair to be decided by authority;
and the voice of nature and experience &s;eems plainly
to oppo&s;e the &s;elfi&s;h theory.</P>
<P>WE frequently be&s;tow prai&s;e on virtuous actions,
performed in very di&s;tant ages and remote countries;
where the utmo&s;t &s;ubtilty of imagination would not
di&s;cover any appearance of &s;elf-intere&s;t, or find any

<P>WHERE private advantage concurs with general
affection for virtue, we readily perceive and avow the
mixture of the&s;e di&s;tinct &s;entiments, which have a
very different feeling and influence on the mind. We
<PB N="79" REF="81">
prai&s;e, perhaps, with more alacrity, where the gene|rous,
humane action contributes to our particular in|tere&s;t:
But the topics of prai&s;e which we in&s;i&s;t on
are very wide of this circum&s;tance. And we may
attempt to bring over others to our &s;entiments, with|out
endeavouring to convince them, that they reap
any advantage from the actions, which we recom|mend
to their approbation and applau&s;e.</P>
<P>FRAME the model of a prai&s;e-worthy character,
con&s;i&s;ting of all the mo&s;t amiable moral virtues: Give

individual happine&s;s.</P>
<P>ONCE on a time, a &s;tate&s;man, in the &s;hock and
concurrence of parties, prevailed &s;o far as to procure,
by his eloquence, the bani&s;hment of an able adver|&s;ary;

and countries, and con&s;ider the advantage, which we
&s;hould have reaped from the&s;e characters, had we been

when our <HI>real</HI> intere&s;t is &s;till kept in view, and
is often acknowledged to be entirely di&s;tinct from the

<P>A MAN, brought to the brink of a precipice, can|not
look down without trembling; and the &s;entiment
of <HI>imaginary</HI> danger actuates him, in oppo&s;ition to the
opinion and belief of <HI>real</HI> &s;afety. But the imagina|tion
<PB N="81" REF="83">
is here a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pre&s;ence of a &s;triking ob|ject;
and yet prevails not, except it be al&s;o aided by
novelty, and the unu&s;ual appearance of the object.
Cu&s;tom &s;oon reconciles us to heights and precipices,
and wears off the&s;e fal&s;e and delu&s;ive terrors. The
rever&s;e is ob&s;ervable in the e&s;timates which we form
of characters and manners; and the more we habi|tuate
our&s;elves to an accurate &s;crutiny of the moral
&s;pecies, the more delicate feeling do we acquire of
the mo&s;t minute di&s;tinctions between vice and virtue.
Such frequent occa&s;ion, indeed, have we, in common
life, to pronounce all kinds of moral determinations,
that no object of this kind can be new or unu&s;ual to
us; nor could any <HI>fal&s;e</HI> views or prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions main|tain

<P>SELF-LOVE is a principle in human nature of &s;uch
exten&s;ive energy, and the intere&s;t of each individual
is, in general, &s;o clo&s;ely connected with that of the

who fancied, that all our concern for the public
might be re&s;olved into a concern for our own happi|ne&s;s
and pre&s;ervation. They &s;aw, every moment,
in&s;tances of approbation or blame, &s;atisfaction or di&s;|plea&s;ure
towards characters and actions; they deno|minated
the objects of the&s;e &s;entiments, <HI>virtues</HI> or
<HI>vices;</HI> they ob&s;erved, that the former had a tendency
to encrea&s;e the happine&s;s, and the latter the mi&s;ery of
&s;ociety; they a&s;ked, whether it was po&s;&s;ible that we
could have any general concern for &s;ociety, or any
di&s;intere&s;ted re&s;entment of the welfare or injury of
others; they found it &s;impler to con&s;ider all the&s;e &s;en|timents
as modifications of &s;elf love; and they di&s;|covered
a pretext, at lea&s;t, for this unity of principle,
in that clo&s;e union of intere&s;t, which is &s;o ob&s;ervable
between the public and each individual.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85">
BUT notwith&s;tanding this frequent confu&s;ion of in|tere&s;ts,
'tis ea&s;y to attain what natural philo&s;ophers,
after my lord BACON, have affected to call the <HI>expe|rimentum
crucis,</HI> or that experiment, which points
out the right way in any doubt or ambiguity. We
have found in&s;tances, in which private intere&s;t was
&s;eparated from public; in which it was even contrary:
And yet we ob&s;erved the moral &s;entiment to continue,
notwith&s;tanding this disjunction of intere&s;ts. And
wherever the&s;e di&s;tinct intere&s;ts &s;en&s;ibly concurred,
we always found a &s;en&s;ible encrea&s;e of the &s;entiment,
and a more warm affection to virtue, and dete&s;tation
of vice, or what we properly call, <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>re|venge.</HI>
Compelled by the&s;e in&s;tances, we mu&s;t re|nounce
the theory, which accounts for every moral
&s;entiment by the principle of &s;elf-love. We mu&s;t
adopt a more public affection, and allow, that the
intere&s;ts of &s;ociety are not, even on their own ac|count,
entirely indifferent to us. U&s;efulne&s;s is only
a tendency to a certain end; and 'tis a contradiction
in terms, that any thing plea&s;es as means to an end,
where the end it&s;elf no way affects us. If therefore
u&s;efulne&s;s be a &s;ource of moral &s;entiment, and if this
u&s;efulne&s;s be not always con&s;idered with a reference
to &s;elf; it follows, that every thing, which contributes
to the happine&s;s of &s;ociety, recommends it&s;elf directly
to our approbation and good-will. Here is a prin|ciple,
which accounts, in great part, for the origin
<PB N="84" REF="86">
of morality: And what need we &s;eek for ab&s;tru&s;e
and remote &s;y&s;tems, when there occurs one &s;o obvious
and natural<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">'Tis needle&s;s to pu&s;h our re&s;earches &s;o far as to a&s;k, why we have humanity or a fellow-feeling with others. 'Tis &s;uffi|cient, that this is experienced to be a principle in human na|ture. We mu&s;t &s;top &s;omewhere in our examination of cau&s;es; and there are, in every &s;cience, &s;ome general principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any principle more general. No man is ab&s;olutely indifferent to the happine&s;s and mi&s;ery of others. The fir&s;t has a natural tendency to give plea&s;ure; the &s;econd, pain. This every one may find in him&s;elf. It is not probable, that the&s;e principles can be re&s;olved into principles more &s;imple and univer&s;al, whatever attempts may have been made to that purpo&s;e. But if it were po&s;&s;ible, it belongs not to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject; and we may here &s;afely con&s;ider the&s;e principles as original: Happy, if we can render all the con&s;equences &s;uf|ficiently plain and per&s;picuous.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>HAVE we any difficulty to comprehend the force of
humanity and benevolence? Or to conceive, that the
very a&s;pect of happine&s;s, joy, pro&s;perity, gives plea|&s;ure;
that of pain, &s;uffering, &s;orrow, communicates
unea&s;ine&s;s? The human countenance, &s;ays HO|RACE<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Uti $identibus arrident, ita flentibus ad$lent Humani vultus. HOR.</NOTE>, borrows &s;miles or tears from the human

lo&s;es all enjoyment, except merely of the &s;peculative
kind; and that becau&s;e the movements of his heart
are not forwarded by corre&s;pondent movements in his

for us, in our calm judgments and di&s;cour&s;e con|cerning

differences, and render our &s;entiments more public and

per&s;ons, who are in a different &s;ituation from us, and
who could never conver&s;e with us, were we to remain
con&s;tantly in that po&s;ition and point of view, which

bya&s;s, that what promotes their happine&s;s is good,
what tends to their mi&s;ery is evil, without any farther
regard or con&s;ideration. Here then are the faint ru|diments,
at lea&s;t, or out-lines, of a <HI>general</HI> di&s;tinction

There is no nece&s;&s;ity, that a generous action, barely

enquire, if the merit of all &s;ocial virture is
not derived from the feelings of humanity, with
which it affects the &s;pectators. It appears to be mat|ter
of fact, that the circum&s;tance of <HI>utility,</HI> in all

in&s;eparable from all the other &s;ocial virtues, huma|nity,
genero&s;ity, charity, affability, lenity, mercy and
moderation: And in a word, that it is the foundation
of the chief part of morals, which has a reference to
mankind and our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>IT appears al&s;o, in our general approbation of

&s;ympathy enter &s;o deep into all our &s;entiments, and

learn the force of the benevolent principle; &s;ince 'tis
impo&s;&s;ible for any thing to plea&s;e as means to an end,
where the end is totally indifferent. On the other
hand, were it doubtful whether there was, implanted
in our nature, any general principle of moral blame
and approbation, yet when we &s;ee, in numberle&s;s in|&s;tances,

exact line between the one and the other; or at lea&s;t
becau&s;e we con&s;ider the que&s;tion as merely gramma|tical.
And the more fully to ju&s;tify our practice in
this particular, we &s;hall endeavour to make it appear,
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that in common life, the &s;entiments of cen&s;ure
or approbation, produced by mental qualities of every
kind, are nearly &s;imilar; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that all antient
morali&s;ts, (the be&s;t models) in treating of them, make
little or no difference among them.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST.</HI> It &s;eems certain, that the <HI>&s;entiment</HI> of
con&s;cious worth, the &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, proceeding from
a review of a man's own conduct and character; it
&s;eems certain, I &s;ay, that this &s;entiment, which tho'
the mo&s;t common of all others, has no proper name
in our language<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The term, pride, is commonly taken in a bad &s;en&s;e; but this &s;entiment &s;eems indifferent, and may be either good or bad, according as it is well or ill founded, and according to the other circum&s;tances which accompany it. The FRENCH expre&s;s this &s;entiment by the term, <HI>amour propre,</HI> but as they al&s;o expre&s;s &s;elf-love as well as vanity, by the &s;ame term, there ari&s;es thence a great confu&s;ion in ROCHEFOUCAULT, and many of thier moral writers.</NOTE>, ari&s;es from the endowments of cou|rage
<PB N="106" REF="107">
and capacity, indu&s;try and ingenuity, as well as
from any other mental excellencies. Who, on the
other hand, is not deeply mortified with reflecting on
his own folly or di&s;&s;olutene&s;s, and feels not a &s;ecret
&s;ting or compunction, whenever his memory pre&s;ents
any pa&s;t occurrence, where he behaved with &s;tupidity
or ill-manners? No time can efface the cruel ideas
of a man's own ill-conduct, or of affronts, which
cowardice or impudence has brought upon him. They
&s;till haunt his &s;olitary hours, damp his mo&s;t a&s;piring
thoughts, and &s;how him, even to him&s;elf, in the mo&s;t
contemptible and mo&s;t odious colours imaginable.</P>
<P>WHAT is there too we are more anxious to conceal
from others than &s;uch blunders, infirmities, and mean|ne&s;&s;es,
or more dread to have expo&s;ed by raillery and
&s;atyre? And is not the chief object of vanity, our
bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our elo|quence
or addre&s;s, our ta&s;te or ability? The&s;e we
di&s;play with care, if not with o&s;tentation; and com|monly
&s;how more ambition of excelling in them,
than even in the &s;ocial virtues them&s;elves, which are,
<PB N="107" REF="108">
in reality, of &s;uch &s;uperior excellence. Good-nature
and hone&s;ty, e&s;pecially the latter, are &s;o indi&s;pen&s;ibly
required, that, tho' the greate&s;t cen&s;ure attends any
violation of the&s;e duties, no eminent prai&s;e follows
&s;uch common in&s;tances of them, as &s;eem e&s;&s;ential to
the &s;upport of human &s;ociety. And hence the rea|&s;on,
in my opinion, why, tho' men often prai&s;e &s;o
liberally the qualities of their heart, they are &s;hy of
commending the endowments of their head: Becau&s;e
the latter virtues being &s;uppo&s;ed more rare and extra|ordinary,
are ob&s;erved to be the more u&s;ual objects of
pride and &s;elf conceit; and when boa&s;ted of, beget a
&s;trong &s;u&s;picion of the&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>'TIS hard to tell, whether you hunt a man's cha|racter
mo&s;t by calling him a knave or a coward, and
whether a bea&s;tly glutton or drunkard be not as odi|ous
and contemptible, as a &s;el&s;i&s;h, ungenerous mi&s;er.
Give me my choice; and I would rather, for my own
happine&s;s and &s;elf-enjoyment, have a friendly, hu|mane
heart than po&s;&s;e&s;s all the other virtues of DE|MOSTHENES
and PHILIP united: But I would rather
pa&s;s with the world for one endowed with exten&s;ive
genius and intrepid courage, and &s;hould thence ex|pect
&s;tronger in&s;tances of general applau&s;e and admi|ration.
The figure which a man makes in life, the
reception which he meets with in company, the
e&s;teem paid him by his acquaintance; all the&s;e advan|tages
depend as much upon his good &s;en&s;e and judg|ment,
<PB N="108" REF="109">
as upon any other part of his character. Had
a man the be&s;t intentions in the world, and were the
farthe&s;t removed from all inju&s;tice and violence, he
would never be able to make him&s;elf be much re|garded,
without a moderate &s;hare, at lea&s;t, of parts
and under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>WHAT is it then we can here di&s;pute about? If
&s;en&s;e and courage, temperance and indu&s;try, wi&s;dom
and knowledge confe&s;&s;edly form a con&s;iderable part
of <HI>per&s;onal merit:</HI> If a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e quali|ties
is both better &s;atisfied with him&s;elf, and better
entitled to the good-will, e&s;teem, and &s;ervices of others,
than one entirely devoid of them; if, in &s;hort, the
<HI>&s;entiments</HI> be &s;imilar, which ari&s;e from the&s;e endow|ments
and from the &s;ocial virtues; is there any rea&s;on
for being &s;o extremely &s;crupulous about a <HI>word,</HI> or
di&s;puting whether they are entitled to the denomina|tion
of virtue? It may, indeed, be pretended, that
the &s;entiment of approbation, which tho&s;e accom|pli&s;hments
produce, be&s;ides its being <HI>inferior,</HI> is al&s;o
&s;omewhat <HI>different</HI> from that, which attends the vir|tues
of ju&s;tice and humanity. But this &s;eems not a
&s;ufficient rea&s;on for ranking them entirely under dif|ferent
cla&s;&s;es and appellations. The character of
CAESAR and that of CATO, as drawn by SALLUST,
are both of them virtuous, in the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t
limited &s;en&s;e of the word; but in a different way:
Nor are the &s;entiments entirely the &s;ame, which ari&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="110">
from them. The one produces love; the other,
e&s;teem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We
could wi&s;h to meet the one character in a friend; of
the other we &s;hould be ambitious in our&s;elves. In
like manner the approbation, which attends tempe|rance
or indu&s;try or frugality, may be &s;omewhat dif|ferent
from that which is paid to the &s;ocial virtues,
without making them entirely of a different &s;pecies.
And indeed, we may ob&s;erve, that the&s;e endowments,
no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of
them, the &s;ame kind of approbation. Good &s;en&s;e
and genius beget e&s;teem and regard: Wit and hu|mour
excite love and affection<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Love and e&s;teem are nearly the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, and ari&s;e from &s;imilar cau&s;es. The qualities, which produce both, are &s;uch as communicate plea&s;ure. But where this plea&s;ure is &s;e|vere and &s;erious; or where its object is great and makes a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, or where it produces any degree of humility and awe: In all the&s;e ca&s;es, the pa&s;&s;ion, which ari&s;es from the plea&s;ure, is more properly denominated e&s;teem than love. Be|nevolence attends both: But is connected with love in a more eminent degree. There &s;eems to be &s;till a &s;tronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in e&s;teem; and the rea&s;on would not be difficult to one, who &s;tudied accurately the pa&s;|&s;ions. All the&s;e various mixtures and compo&s;itions and appear|ances of &s;entiment form a very curious &s;ubject of &s;peculation, but are wide of our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Thro'out this enquiry, we always con&s;ider in general, what qualities are a &s;ubject of prai&s;e or of cen&s;ure, without entering into all the minute diffe|rences of &s;entiment, which they excite.

<P>IT &s;eems evident, that where a quality or habit is
&s;ubjected to our examination, if it appear, in any re|&s;pect,
prejudicial to the per&s;on, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, or
&s;uch as incapacitates him for bu&s;ine&s;s and action, it is
<PB N="117" REF="118">
in&s;tantly blamed, and ranked among his faults and
imperfections. Indolence, negligence, want of or|der
and method, ob&s;tinacy, ficklene&s;s, ra&s;hne&s;s, cre|dulity;
the&s;e qualities were never e&s;teemed by any
one indifferent to a character; much le&s;s, extolled as
accompli&s;hments or virtues. The prejudice, re&s;ulting
from them, immediately &s;trikes our eye, and gives
us the &s;entiment of pain and di&s;approbation.</P>
<P>NO quality, 'tis allowed, is ab&s;olutely either blame|able
or prai&s;e-worthy. 'Tis all according to its de|gree.
A due medium, &s;ay the PERIPATETICS, is
the charecteri&s;tic of virtue. But this medium is chiefly
determined by utility. A proper celerity, for in|&s;tance,
and di&s;patch in bu&s;ine&s;s, is commendable.
When defective, no progre&s;s is ever made in the exe|cution
of any purpo&s;e: When exce&s;&s;ive, it engages
us in precipitate, and ill-concerted mea&s;ures and en|terprizes:

NO force of imagination can convert us
into another per&s;on, and make us fancy, that we,
being that per&s;on, reap benefit from tho&s;e valuable
qualities, which belong to him. Or if it did, no ce|lerity
of imagination could immediately tran&s;port us
back, into our&s;elves, and make us love and e&s;teem
the per&s;on, as different from us. Views and &s;enti|ments,
&s;o oppo&s;ite to known truth, and to each other,
could never have place, at the &s;ame time, in the

fortune, and the execution of great or advantageous
undertakings; we are &s;truck with &s;uch agreeable
images, and feel a complacency and regard imme|diately
ari&s;e towards him. The ideas of happine&s;s,
joy, triumph, pro&s;perity, are connected with every
circum&s;tance of his character, and diffu&s;e over our

This &s;eems in&s;eparable from our make and con&s;titu|tion. But they are only the more generous minds, that are thence prompted to &s;eek zealou&s;ly the good of others, and to have a real pa&s;&s;ion for their welfare. With men of narrow and ungenerous &s;pirits, this &s;ympathy goes not beyond a &s;light feel|ing of the imagination, which &s;erves only to excite &s;entiments of complacency or cen&s;ure, and makes them appley to the object either honourable or di&s;honourable appellations.

a&s;s, irre&s;olute and undetermined, between equal
motives; or rather, like the &s;ame a&s;s between two
pieces of wood or marble, without any inclination or
propen&s;ity to either &s;ide. The con&s;equence, I be|lieve,
mu&s;t be allowed ju&s;t, that &s;uch a per&s;on, being
ab&s;olutely unconcerned, either in the public good of
a community or the private utility of others, would
<PB N="120" REF="121">
look on every quality, however pernicious, or how|ever
beneficial, to &s;ociety, or to its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, with
the &s;ame indifference as on the mo&s;t common and un|intere&s;ting
object.</P>
<P>BUT if, in&s;tead of this fancied mon&s;ter, we &s;uppo&s;e
a <HI>man</HI> to form a judgment or determination in the
ca&s;e, there is to him a plain foundation of preference,
where every thing el&s;e is equal; and however cool his
choice may be, if his heart be &s;elfi&s;h, or if the per&s;ons
intere&s;ted be remote from him; there mu&s;t &s;till be a
choice, or di&s;tinction between what is u&s;eful, and
what is pernicious. Now this di&s;tinction is the &s;ame
in all its parts, with the <HI>moral di&s;tinction,</HI> who&s;e foun|dation
has been &s;o often, and &s;o much in vain, en|quired
after. The &s;ame endowments of the mind,
in every circum&s;tance, are agreeable to the &s;entiment
of morals and to that of humanity; the &s;ame temper is
&s;u&s;ceptible of high degrees of the one &s;entiment and
of the other; and the &s;ame alteration in the objects,
by their nearer approach or by connexions, enlivens
the one and the other. By all the rules of philo&s;ophy,
therefore, we mu&s;t conclude, that the&s;e &s;entiments
are originally the &s;ame; &s;ince, in each particular, even
the mo&s;t minute, they are governed by the &s;ame laws,
and are moved by the &s;ame objects.</P>
<P>WHY do philo&s;ophers infer, with the greate&s;t cer|tainty,
that the moon is kept in its orbit by the &s;ame
<PB N="121" REF="122">
force of gravity, which make bodies fall near the
&s;urface of the earth, but becau&s;e the&s;e effects are,
upon computation, found &s;imilar and equal? And
mu&s;t not this argument bring as &s;trong conviction, in
moral as in natural di&s;qui&s;itions?</P>
<P>TO prove, by any long detail, that all the quali|ties,
u&s;eful to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, are approved, and the
contrary cen&s;ured, would be &s;uperfluous. The lea&s;t
reflection. on what is every day experienced in life,
will be &s;ufficient. We &s;hall only mention a few in|&s;tances,
in order to remove, if po&s;&s;ible, all doubt and
he&s;itation.</P>
<P>THE quality the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the execution
of any u&s;eful enterprize, is DISCRETION; by
which we carry on a &s;afe intercour&s;e with others,
give due attention to our own and to their character,
weigh each circum&s;tance of the bu&s;ine&s;s which we
undertake, and employ the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t means for
the attainment of any end or purpo&s;e. To a CROM|WEL,
perhaps, or a DE RETZ, di&s;cretion may appear
an alderman-like virtue, as Dr. SWIFT calls it; and
being incompatible with tho&s;e va&s;t de&s;igns, to which
their courage and ambition prompted them, it might
really, in them, be a fault or imperfection. But in
the conduct of ordinary life, no virtue is more requi|&s;ite,
not only to obtain &s;ucce&s;s, but to avoid the mo&s;t
fatal mi&s;carriages and di&s;appointments. The greate&s;t
<PB N="122" REF="123">
parts without it, as ob&s;erved by an elegant writer,
may be fatal to their owner; as POLYPHEMUS de|prived
of his eye was only the more expo&s;ed, on ac|count
of his enormous &s;trength and &s;tature.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t character, indeed, were it not rather too
perfect for human nature, is that which gives nothing
to temper of any kind; but alternately employs en|terpri&s;e
and caution, as each is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to the particu|lar
purpo&s;e intended. Such is the excellence which
St. EVREMOND a&s;cribes to mare&s;chal TURENNE,
who di&s;played every campaign, as he grew older,
more temerity in his military enterpri&s;es; and being
now, from long experience, perfectly acquainted with
every incident in war, he advanced with greater
firmne&s;s and &s;ecurity, in a road &s;o well known to him.
FABIUS, &s;ays MACHIAVEL, was cautious; SCIPIO
enterpri&s;ing: And both &s;ucceeded, becau&s;e the &s;itua|tion
of the ROMAN affairs, during the command of
each, was peculiarly adapted to his genius; but both
would have failed, and the&s;e &s;ituations been inverted.
He is happy, who&s;e circum&s;tances &s;uit his temper;
but he is more excellent, who can &s;uit his temper
to any circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>WHAT need is there to di&s;play the prai&s;es of IN|DUSTRY,
and to extol its advantages, in the
acqui&s;ition of power and riches, or in rai&s;ing what we
<PB N="123" REF="124">
call a <HI>fortune</HI> in the world? The tortoi&s;e, according
to the fable, by his a&s;&s;iduity, gained the race of the
hare, though po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much &s;uperior &s;wiftne&s;s. A
man's time, when well hu&s;banded, is like cultivated
field, of which a few acres produce more of what is
u&s;eful to life, than exten&s;ive provinces, even of the
riche&s;t &s;oil, when over-run with weeds and brambles.</P>
<P>BUT all pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in life, or even of toler|able
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence, mu&s;t fail, where a rea&s;onable FRU|GALITY
is wanting. The heap, in&s;tead of in|crea&s;ing,
dimini&s;hes daily, and leaves its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;o
much more unhappy, that not having been able to
confine his expences to a large revenue, he will &s;till
le&s;s be able to live contentedly on a &s;mall one. The
&s;ouls of men, according to PLATO<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Phaedo.</NOTE>, inflamed with
impure appetites, and lo&s;ing the body, which alone
afforded means of &s;atisfaction, hover about the earth,
and haunt the places, where their bodies are depo&s;ited;
po&s;&s;e&s;t with a longing defire to recover the lo&s;t or|gans
of &s;en&s;ation. So may we fee worthle&s;s prodi|gals,
having con&s;umed their fortunes in wild de|bauches,
thru&s;ting them&s;elves into every plentiful
table, and every party of plea&s;ure, hated even by the
vicious, and de&s;pi&s;ed even by fools.</P>
<P>THE one extreme of frugality is <HI>avarice,</HI> which,
as it both doprives a man of all u&s;e of his riches, and
<PB N="124" REF="125">
checks ho&s;pitality and every &s;ocial enjoyment, is
ju&s;tly cen&s;ured on a double account. <HI>Prodigality,</HI> the
other extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a man
him&s;elf; and each of the&s;e extremes is blamed above
the other, according to the temper of the per&s;on who
cen&s;ures, and according to his greater or le&s;s &s;en&s;ibility
to plea&s;ure, either &s;ocial or &s;en&s;ual.</P>
<P>QUALITIES often derive their merit from compli|cated
&s;ources. <HI>Hone&s;ty, fidelity, truth,</HI> are prai&s;ed for
their immediate tendency to promote the intere&s;ts of
&s;ociety; but they are al&s;o con&s;idered as advantageous
to the per&s;on him&s;elf, and as the &s;ource of that tru&s;t
and confidence, which can alone give a man any con|&s;ideration
in life. One becomes contemptible, as
well as odious, when he forgets the duty which in
this particular he owes to him&s;elf as well as to
&s;ociety.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, this con&s;ideration is the <HI>chief</HI>&s;ource of
the high blame, which is thrown on any in&s;tance of
faiture among women in point of <HI>cha&s;tity.</HI> The
greate&s;t con&s;ideration, which can be acquired by that
&s;en&s;e, is derived from their fidelity; and a woman is
cheap and vulgar, lo&s;es her rank, and is expo&s;ed
to every in&s;ult, who is deficient in this particular.
The &s;malle&s;t failure is here &s;ufficient to bla&s;t her cha|racter!
A female has &s;o many opportunities of &s;ecretly
indulging the&s;e appetites, that nothing can give us
<PB N="125" REF="126">
&s;ecurity but her ab&s;olute modefty and re&s;erve; and
where a breach is once made, it can &s;carcely ever be
fully repaired. If a man behaves with cowardice on
one occa&s;ion, a contrary conduct re-in&s;tates him in his
character. But by what action can a woman, who&s;e
behaviour has once been di&s;&s;olute, be able to a&s;&s;ure
us, that &s;he has formed better re&s;olutions, and has
&s;elf-command enough to carry them into practice?</P>
<P>ALL men, 'tis allowed, are equally defirous of
happine&s;s; but few are &s;ucce&s;sful in the pur&s;uit: One
chief cau&s;e is the want of STRENGTH of MIND,
which might enable them to re&s;i&s;t the temptation of
pre&s;ent ea&s;e or plea&s;ure, and carry them forward in
the &s;earch of more di&s;tant profit and enjoyment. Our
affections, on a general pro&s;pect of their objects, from
certain rules of conduct, and certain mea&s;ures of pre|ference
of one above another: And thefe deci&s;ions,
though really the re&s;ult of our calm pa&s;&s;ions, and
propen&s;ities, (for what el&s;e can pronounce any object
eligible or the contrary?) are yet &s;aid, by a natural
abu&s;e of terms, to be the determinations of pure <HI>rea|&s;on</HI>
and reflection. But when &s;ome of the&s;e objects
approach nearer us, or acquire the advantages of
favourable lights and po&s;itions, which catch the heart
or imagination; our general re&s;olutions are frequently
confounded, a &s;mall enjoyment preferred, and la&s;ting
&s;hame and &s;orrow entailed upon us. And however
<PB N="126" REF="127">
poets may employ their wit and eloquence, in cele|brating
pre&s;ent plea&s;ure, and rejecting all di&s;tant
views to fame, health, or fortune; 'tis obvious, that
this practice is the &s;ource of all di&s;&s;olutene&s;s and di&s;or|der,
repentance and mi&s;ery. A man of &s;trong and
determined temper adheres tenaciou&s;ly to his general
re&s;olutions, and is neither &s;educed by the allurements
or plea&s;ure, nor terrified by the menaces of pain; but
keeps &s;till in view tho&s;e di&s;tant pu$&s;uits, by which he,
at once, en&s;ures his happine&s;s and his honour.</P>
<P>SELF-SATISFACTION, at lea&s;t in &s;ome degree, is an
advantage, which equally attends the FOOL and the
WISE-MAN: But 'tis the only one; nor is there
any other circum&s;tance in the conduct of life, where
they are upon an equal footing. Bu&s;ine&s;s, books,
conver&s;ation, for all of the&s;e, a fool is totally incapa|$$ated,
and except condemned by his &s;tation to the
coar&s;e&s;t drudgery, remains a <HI>u&s;ele&s;s</HI> burthen upon the
earth. A cordingly, 'tis found, that men are in|finitely
jealous of their character in this particular;
and many in&s;tances are &s;een of profligacy and treache|ry,
the mo&s;t avowed, and unre$erved; none of bear|ing
patiently the imputation of ignorance and &s;tupidi|ty.
DICAEARCHUS, the MACEDONIAN general,
who&punc; as POLYBIUS tells us<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17. cap. 35.</NOTE>, openly erected one
altar to impiety, and another to inju&s;tice, in order to
<PB N="127" REF="128">
bid defiance to mankind; even he, I am well a&s;&s;ured,
would have &s;tarted at the epithet of <HI>fool,</HI> and have
meditated revenge for &s;o injurious an appellation.
Except the affection of parents, the &s;tronge&s;t and
mo&s;t indi&s;&s;oluble bond in nature, no connexion has
&s;trength &s;ufficient to &s;upport the di&s;gu&s;t ari&s;ing from
this character. Love it&s;elf, which can &s;ub&s;i&s;t under
treachery, ingratitude, malice, and infidelity, is im|mediately
extingui&s;hed by it, when perceived and ac|knowleged;
nor are deformity and old-age more
fatal to the dominion of that pa&s;&s;ion. So dreadful
are the ideas of an utter incapacity for any purpo&s;e or
undertaking, and of continued error and mi&s;conduct
in life!</P>
<P>WHEN 'tis a&s;ked, whether a quick or a &s;low appre|hen&s;ion
be mo&s;t valuable? Whether one, that, at fir&s;t
view, penetrates far into a &s;ubject, but can perform
nothing upon &s;tudy; or a contrary character, which
mu&s;t work out every thing by dint of application?
Whether a clear head or a copious invention? Whe|ther
a profound genius or a &s;ure judgment? In &s;hort,
what character, or peculiar turn of under&s;tanding is
more excellent than another? 'Tis evident, that we
can an&s;wer none of the&s;e que&s;tions, without con&s;ider|ing
which of tho&s;e qualities capacitates a man be&s;t
for the world, and carries him farthe&s;t in any under|taking.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="129">
IF refined &s;en&s;e and exalted &s;en&s;e be not &s;o <HI>u&s;eful</HI>
as common &s;en&s;e, their rarity, their novelty, and the
noblene&s;s of their objects make &s;ome compen&s;ation,
and render them the admiration of mankind: As
gold, though le&s;s &s;erviceable than iron, acquires,

<P>THE defects of judgment can be &s;upplied by no
art or invention; but tho&s;e of MEMORY frequently
may, both in bu&s;ine&s;s and in &s;tudy, by method and

to writing; and we &s;carce ever hear a &s;hort memory
given as a rea&s;on for a man's want of &s;ucce&s;s in any
undertaking. But in antient times, when no man
could make a figure without the talent of &s;peaking,
and when the audience were too delicate to bear &s;uch
crude, undige&s;ted harangues as our extemporary ora|tors
offer to public a&s;&s;emblies; the faculty of memory
was then of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, and was accord|ingly
much more valned than at pre&s;ent. Scarce any
great genius is mentioned in antiquity, who is not
celebrated for this talent; and CICERO enumerates it
among the other &s;ublime qualities of CAESAR him|&s;elf<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, literae, sura, cogi|tatio, diligentia, &amp;c. PHILIP. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>IN this kingdom, &s;uch continued o&s;tentation, of

more difficult, in a &s;peculative way, to re&s;olve into
&s;elf-love, the merit which we a&s;cribe to the &s;elfi&s;h
virtues above-mentioned, than that even of the &s;ocial
virtues, ju&s;tice and beneficence. For this latter pur|po&s;e
we need but &s;ay, that whatever conduct pro|motes
the good of the community, is loved, prai&s;ed,
and e&s;teemed by the community, on account of that
utility and intere&s;t, of which every one partakes:
And though this affection and regard be, in reality,
gratitude, not &s;elf-love, yet a di&s;tinction, even of this

yet e&s;teemed and valued; by what theory or &s;y&s;tem
can we account for this &s;entiment from &s;elf-love, or
deduce it from that favourite origin? There &s;eems
here a nece&s;&s;ity of confe&s;&s;ing that the happine&s;s and
mi&s;ery of others are not &s;pectacles entirely indifferent
to us; but that the view of the former, whether in its

communicates a &s;ecret joy and &s;atisfaction; the ap|peareance

<P><PB N="135" REF="136">
A DISPOSITION on turn of mind, which qualifies a
man to ri&s;e in the world, and advance his fortune, is
entitled to e&s;teem and regard, as has been already ex|plained.
It may, therefore, naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that the actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of riches and authority will
have a con&s;iderable influence over the&s;e &s;entiments.</P>
<P>LET us examine any hypothe&s;is, by which we can
account for the regard paid the rich and powerful:
We &s;hall find none &s;atisfactory but that which derives
it from the enjoyment, communicated to the &s;pectator
by the images of pro&s;perity, happine&s;s, ea&s;e, plenty,
command, and the gratification of every appetite.
Self-love, for in&s;tance, which &s;ome affect &s;o much to
con&s;ider as the &s;ource of every &s;entiment, is plainly in|&s;ufficient
to this purpo&s;e. Where no good-will or
friend&s;hip appears, 'tis difficult to conceive on what
we can found our hope of advantage from the riches
of others; though we naturally re&s;pect the rich, even
<PB N="136" REF="137">
before they di&s;cover any &s;uch favourable di&s;po&s;ition
towards us.</P>
<P>We are affected with the &s;ame &s;entiments, when we
lie &s;o much out of the &s;phere of their activity, that
they cannot even be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of
&s;erving us. A pri&s;oner of war, in all civilized na|tions,
is treated with a regard &s;uited to his condition;
and riches, 'tis evident, go far towards fixing the
condition of any per&s;on. If birth and quality enter
for a &s;hare, this &s;till affords us an argument to our
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. For what is it we call a man of
birth, but one, who is de&s;cended from a long &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of rich and powerful ance&s;tors, and who acquires
our e&s;teem by his connexion with per&s;ons, whom we
e&s;teem? His ance&s;tors, therefore, though dead, are
re&s;pected, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, on account of their
riches; and con&s;equently, without any kind of expec|tation.</P>
<P>BUT not to go &s;o far as pri&s;oners of war or the
dead, to find in&s;tances of this di&s;intere&s;ted regard for
riches; we may only ob&s;erve, with a little attention,
tho&s;e phaenomena, which occur in common life and
conver&s;ation. A man, who is him&s;elf, we &s;hall &s;up|po&s;e,
of a competent fortune, and of no profe&s;&s;ion,
being introduced to a company of &s;trangers, natural|ly
treats them with different degrees of re&s;pect, as he
is informed of their different fortunes and conditions;
<PB N="137" REF="138">
though 'tis impo&s;&s;ible that he can &s;o &s;uddenly propo&s;e,
and perhaps he would not accept of, any pecuniary
advantage from them. A traveller is always admitted
into company, and meets with civility, in proportion
as his train and equipage &s;peak him a man of great or
moderate fortune. In &s;hort, the different ranks of
men are, in a great mea&s;ure, regulated by riches;
and that with regard to &s;uperiors as well as inferiors,
&s;trangers as well as acquaintance.</P>
<P>WHAT remains, therefore, but to conclude, that
as riches are de&s;ired for our&s;elf only as the means of
gratifying our appetites, either at pre&s;ent or in &s;ome
imaginary future period; they beget e&s;teem in others
merely from their having that influence. This indeed
is their very nature or e&s;&s;ence: They have a direct
reference to the commodities, conveniencies, and
plea&s;ures of life: The bill of a banker, who is broke,
or gold in a de&s;ert i&s;land, would otherwi&s;e be full as
valuable. When we approach a man, who is, as we
&s;ay, at his ea&s;e, we are pre&s;ented with the plea&s;ing
ideas of plenty, &s;atisfaction, cleanline&s;s, warmth; a
chearful hou&s;e, elegant furniture, ready &s;ervice, and
whatever is de&s;irable in meat, drink, or apparel. On
the contrary, when a poor man appears, the di&s;agree|able
images of want, penury, hard labour, dirty fur|niture,
coar&s;e or ragged cloaths, nau&s;eous meat and
di&s;ta&s;teful liquor, immediately &s;trike our fancy. What
el&s;e do we mean by &s;aying that one is rich, the other
<PB N="138" REF="139">
poor? And as regard or contempt is the natural con|&s;equence
of the&s;e different &s;ituations in life; 'tis
ea&s;ily &s;een what additional light and evidence this
throws on our preceding theory, with regard to all
moral di&s;tinctions<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is &s;omething extraordinary, and &s;eemingly unac|countable in the operation of our pa&s;&s;ions, when we con&s;ider the fortune and &s;ituation of others. Very often another's ad|vancement and pro&s;perity produces envy, which has a &s;trong mixture of hatred, and ari&s;es chiefly from the compari&s;on of cu$&s;elves with the per&s;on. At the very &s;ame time, or at lea&s;t, in very &s;hort intervals, we may feel the pa&s;&s;ion of re&s;pect, which is a &s;pecies of affection or good will, with a mixture of humili|ty. On the other hand, the misfortunes of our fellows often cau&s;e pity, which has in it a &s;trong mixture of good-will. This &s;entiment of pity is nearly allied to contempt, which is a &s;pecies of di&s;like, with a mixture of pride. I only point out the&s;e phaenomena, as a &s;ubject of &s;peculation to &s;uch as are curious with regard to moral enquiries. 'Tis &s;ufficient for the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve in general, that power and riches commonly cau&s;e re&s;pect, poverty and meanne&s;s contempt, tho' particular views and incidents may &s;ometimes rai&s;e the pa&s;&s;ions of envy and of pity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A MAN, who has cured him&s;elf of all ridiculous
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and is fully, &s;incerely, and &s;teadily
convinced, from experience as well as philo&s;ophy,
that the differences of fortune make le&s;s difference in
happine&s;s than is vulgarly imagined; &s;uch a one does
not mea&s;ure out degrees of e&s;teem according to the
<PB N="139" REF="140">
rent-rolls of his acquaintance. He may, indeed, exter|nally
pay a &s;uperior deference to the great lord above
the va&s;&s;al; becau&s;e riches are the mo&s;t convenient,
being the mo&s;t fixed and determinate, &s;ource of di|&s;tinction:
But his internal &s;entiments are more regu|lated
by the per&s;onal characters of men, than by the
accidental and capricious favours of fortune.</P>
<P>IN mo&s;t countries of EUROPE, family, that is, he|reditary
riches, marked with titles and &s;ymbols from
the &s;overeign, is the chief &s;ource of di&s;tinction. In ENG|LAND,
more regard is paid to pre&s;ent opulence and
plenty. Each practice has its advantages and di&s;ad|vantages.
Where birth is re&s;pected, unactive &s;pirit|le&s;s
minds remain in haughty indolence, and dream
of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies: The gene|lous
and ambitious &s;eek honour and command and
reputation and favour. Where riches are the chief idol'
corruption, venality, rapine prevail: Arts, manufac|tures,
commerce, agriculture, flouri&s;h. The former
prejudice, being favourable to military virtue, is more
&s;uited to monarchies. The latter, being the chief
&s;pur to indu&s;try, agrees better with a republican go|vernment.
And we accordingly find. that each of
the&s;e forms of government, by varying the <HI>utility</HI> of
tho&s;e cu&s;toms, has commonly a proportional effect on
the &s;entiments of mankind.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE to OURSELVES.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has pa&s;&s;ed an evening with &s;erious
melancholy people, and has ob&s;erved how
&s;uddenly the conver&s;ation was animated, and what
&s;prightline&s;s diffu&s;ed it&s;elf over the countenance, di&s;|cour&s;e,
and behaviour of the whole circle, on the
acce&s;&s;ion of a good-humoured, lively companion;
&s;uch a one will ea&s;ily allow, that CHEARLULNESS
carries great merit with it, and naturally conciliates
the good-will of mankind. No quality, indeed,
more readily communicates it&s;elf to all around; be|cau&s;e
no one has a greater propen&s;ity to di&s;play it&s;elf,
in jovial talk and plea&s;ant entertainment. The flame
&s;preads thro' the whole circle; and the mo&s;t &s;ullen
and moro&s;e are often caught by it. That the melan|choly
hate the merry, even tho' HORACE &s;ays it, I
have &s;ome difficulty to allow; becau&s;e I have always
ob&s;erved, that where the jollity is moderate and de|cent,
&s;erious people are &s;o much the more delighted,
that it di&s;&s;ipates the gloom, with which they are com|monly

oppre&s;&s;ed; and gives them an unufual en|joyment.</P>
<P>FROM this influence of cheerfulne&s;s, both to com|municate
it&s;elf, and to engage approbation, we many
perceive, that there are another &s;et of mental qualities,
which, without any utility or any tendency to farther
good, either of the community or of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or,
diffu&s;e a &s;atisfaction on the beholders, and procure
friend&s;hip and regard. Their immediate &s;en&s;ation,
to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, is agreeable: Others
enter into the &s;ame humour, and catch the &s;entiment,
by a contagion or natural &s;ympathy: And as we can|not
forbear loving whatever plea&s;es, a kindly emotion
ari&s;es towards the per&s;on, who communicates &s;o much
&s;atisfaction. He is a more animating &s;pectacle: His
pre&s;ence diffu&s;es over us more &s;erene complacency
and enjoyment: Our imagination, entering into his
feelings and di&s;po&s;ition, is affected in a more agree|able
manner, than if a melancholy, dejected, $ullen,
anxious temper, were pre&s;ented to us. Hence the
affection and approbation, which attend the former:
The aver&s;ion and di&s;gu&s;t, with which we regard the
latter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is no man, who on particular occa&s;ions, is not af|fected with all the di&s;agreeable pa&s;&s;ions, fear, anger, dejection, grief, melancholy, anxiety, &amp;c.

his elegant imitator; and &s;uch as are well &s;uited
to an age, in which one hero, as remarked by THU|CYDIDES<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>,
<PB N="150" REF="150">
could a&s;k another, without offence, whe|ther
or not he was a robber. Such al&s;o, very lately,
was the &s;y&s;tem of ethics, which prevailed in many
barbarous parts of IRELAND; if we many credit
SPENCER, in his judicious account of the &s;tate of
that kingdom<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It is a common u&s;e, &s;ays he, among&s;t their gentlemen's &s;ons, that, as &s;oon as they are able to u&s;e their weapons, they &s;trait gather to them&s;elves three or four &s;tragglers or kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the country, tak|ing only meat, he at la&s;t falleth into &s;ome bad occa&s;ion, that &s;hall be offered; which being once made known, he is thence|forth counted a man of worth, in whom there is courage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OF the &s;ame cla&s;s of virtues with courage is that
undi&s;turbed, philo&s;ophical TRANQUILLITY, &s;upe|rior
to pain, &s;orrow, anxiety, and each a&s;&s;ault of
adver&s;e fortune. Con&s;cious of his own virtue, &s;ay
the philo&s;ophers, the &s;age elevates him&s;elf above
every accident of life; and &s;ecurely placed in the
temple of wi&s;dom, looks down on inferior mortals,
engaged in pur&s;uit of honours, riches, reputation,
and each frivolous enjoyment. `The&s;e preten&s;ions,
no doubt, when &s;tretched to the utmo&s;t, are far too
magnificent for human nature. They carry, however,
a grandeur, with them, which &s;eizes the &s;pectator,
<PB N="151" REF="151">
and &s;trikes him with admiration. And the nearer
we can approach, in practice, to this &s;ublime tran|quillity
and indifference (for we mu&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h it
from a &s;tupid in&s;en&s;ibility) the more &s;ecure enjoyment
&s;hall we attain within our&s;elves, and the more great|ne&s;s
of mind &s;hall we di&s;cover to the world. The
philo&s;ophical tranquillity may, indeed, be con&s;idered
only as a branch of mag$animity.</P>
<P>WHO admires not SOCRATES; his perpetual &s;ere|nity
and contentment, amid&s;t the greate&s;t poverty and

and magnanimous care of pre&s;erving liberty, while he
refu&s;ed all a&s;&s;i&s;tance from his friends and di&s;ciples,
and avoided even the dependence of an obligation?
EPICTETUS had not &s;o much as a door to his little
hou&s;e or hovel; and therefore, &s;oon lo&s;t his iron lamp'
the only furniture which he had worth taking. But
re&s;olving to di&s;appoint all robbers for the future, he
fupplied its place with an earthen lamp, of which

THE ATHENIANS pretended to the fir&s;t invention

<P>AND can it po&s;&s;ibly be doubted, that this talent it|&s;elf
of poets, to move the pa&s;&s;ions, this PATHETIC

&s;teadine&s;s, and benign government of AUGUS|TUS,
adorned with all the &s;plendor of his noble

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE to
OTHERS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">'Tis the definition of virtue, that 'tis <HI>a quality of the mind agreeable to or approved of by every one, who con&s;iders or contem|plates it.</HI> But &s;ome qualities produce plea&s;ure, becau&s;e they are u&s;eful to &s;ociety, or u&s;eful or agreeable to the per&s;on him&s;elf; others produce it more immediately: Which is the cla&s;s of vir|tues here con&s;idered.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mutual &s;hocks, in <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> and the oppo&s;i|tions
of intere&s;t and &s;elf-love have con&s;trained
mankind to e&s;tabli&s;h the laws of <HI>ju&s;tice;</HI> in order to
pre&s;erve the advantages of common a&s;&s;i&s;tance and pro|tection:
In like manner, the eternal contrarieties, in
<HI>company,</HI> of men's pride and &s;elf-conceit, have intro|duced
the rules of GOOD-MANNERS or POLITE|NESS;
in order to facilitate the intercour&s;e of minds,
and an undi&s;turbed commerce and conver&s;ation. A|mong
well-bred people, a mutual deference is af|fected:
Contempt of others di&s;gui&s;ed: Authority con|cealed:
<PB N="160" REF="159">
Attention given to each in his turn: And an
ea&s;y &s;tream of conver&s;ation maintained, without ve|hemence,
without mutual interruption, without eager|ne&s;s
for victory, and without any airs of &s;uperiority.
The&s;e attentions and regards are immediately <HI>agree|able</HI>
to others, ab&s;tracted from any con&s;ideration&punc; of
utility or beneficial tendencies: They conciliate af|fection,
promote e&s;teem, and enhance extremely the
merit of the per&s;on, who regulates his behaviour by
them.</P>
<P>MANY of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and
ca&s;ual: But the thing expre&s;&s;ed by them is &s;till the
&s;ame. A SPAN$ARD goes out of his own hou&s;e be|fore
his gue&s;t, to &s;ignify that he leaves him ma&s;ter of
all. In other countries, the landlord walks out la&s;t,
as a common mark of deference and regard.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to render a man perfect <HI>good company,</HI>
he mu&s;t have WIT and INGENUITY as well as
good-manners. What wit is, it may not be ea&s;y to
define: but 'tis ea&s;y &s;urely to determine, that 'tis a
quality immediately <HI>agreeable</HI> to others, and commu|nicating,
on its fir&s;t appearance, a lively joy and &s;a|tisfaction
to every one, who has any comprehen&s;ion of
it. The mo&s;t pro&s;ound metaphy&s;ics, indeed, might
be employed, in explaining the various kinds and
&s;pecies of wit; and many cla&s;&s;es of it, which are now
received on the &s;ole te&s;timony of ta&s;te and &s;entiment,
<PB N="161" REF="160">
might, perhaps, be re&s;olved into more general prin|ciples.
But this is &s;ufficient for our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e,
that it does affect ta&s;te and &s;entiment, and be&s;towing
an immediate enjoyment, is a &s;ure &s;ource of appro|bation
and affection.</P>
<P>IN countries, where man pa&s;s mo&s;t of their time
in conver&s;ation, and vi&s;its and a&s;&s;emblies, the&s;e <HI>compa|nionable</HI>
qualities, &s;o to &s;peak, are of high e&s;timation,
and form a chief part of per&s;onal merit. In coun|tries,
where men live a more dome&s;tic life, and either
are employed in bu&s;ine&s;s or amu&s;e them&s;elves in a
narrower circle of acquaintance, the more &s;olid qua|lities
are chiefly regarded. Thus, I have often ob|&s;erved,
that, among the FRENCH, the fir&s;t que&s;tions,
with regard to a &s;tranger, are, <HI>Is he polite? Has he
wit?</HI> In our own country, the chief prai&s;e be&s;towed,
is always that of a <HI>good-natured, &s;en&s;ible fellow.</HI></P>
<P>IN conver&s;ation, the lively &s;pirit of dialogue is
<HI>agreeable,</HI> even to tho&s;e who de&s;ire not to have any
&s;hare of the di&s;cour&s;e: Hence the teller of long &s;to|ries,
or a pompous declaimer is very little approved
of. But mo&s;t men de&s;ire likewi&s;e their turn in the
conver&s;ation, and regard, with a very evil eye, that
<HI>loquacity,</HI> which deprives them of a right they are na|turally
&s;o jealous of.</P>
<P>THERE are a &s;et of harmle&s;s <HI>liars,</HI> frequently to
be met with in company, who deal much in the mar|velous.
<PB N="162" REF="161">
Their u&s;ual intention is to plea&s;e and enter|tain;
but as men are mo&s;t delighted with what they
conceive to be truth, the&s;e people mi&s;take extremely
the means of plea$ing, and incur univer&s;al blame.
Some indulgence, however, to lying or fiction is given
in <HI>humorous</HI> &s;tories; becau&s;e it is there really agree|able
and entertaining; and truth is not of any im|portance.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, genius of all kinds, even good &s;en&s;e,
and &s;ound rea&s;oning, when it ri&s;es to an eminent de|gree,
and is employed upon &s;ubjects of any con&s;iderable
dignity and nice di&s;cernment; all the&s;e qualities &s;eem
immediately agreeable, and have a merit di&s;tinct from
their u&s;efulne&s;s. Rarity, likewi&s;e, which &s;o much
enhances the price of every thing, mu&s;t &s;et an addi|tional
value on the&s;e noble talents of the human
mind.</P>
<P>MODESTY may be under&s;tood in different &s;en&s;es,
even ab&s;tracted from cha&s;tity, which has been already
treated of. It &s;ometimes means that tenderne&s;s and
nicety of honour, that apprehen&s;ion of blame, that
dread of intru&s;ion or injury towards others, that PU|DOR,
which is the proper guardian of every kind of
virtue, and a &s;ure pre&s;ervative again&s;t vice and cor|ruption.
But its mo&s;t u&s;ual meaning is when it is
oppo&s;ed to <HI>impudence</HI> and <HI>arrogance,</HI> and expre&s;&s;es a
diffidence of our own judgment, and a due attention
<PB N="163" REF="162">
and regard to others. In young men chiefly, this
quality is a &s;ure &s;ign of good &s;en&s;e; and is al&s;o the
certain means of augmenting that endowment, by
pre&s;erving their ears open to in&s;truction, and making
them &s;till gra&s;p after new attainments. But it has a
farther charm to every &s;pectator; by flattering each
man's vanity, and pre&s;enting the appearance of a do|cile
pupil, who receives, with proper attention and
re&s;pect, every word they utter<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>Men have in general a much greater propen&s;ity to over-value than under-value them&s;elves; notwith&s;tanding the opi|nion of ARISTOTLE. This makes us more jealous of the ex|ce&s;s on the former &s;ide, and cau&s;es us to regard, with a parti|cular indulgence, all tendency to mode&s;ty and &s;elf-diffidence; as e&s;teeming the danger le&s;s of falling into any vicious extreme of that nature. 'Tis thus, in countries, where men's bodies are apt to exceed in corpulency, per&s;onal beauty is placed in a much greater degree of $lenderne&s;s, than in countries where that is the mo&s;t u&s;ual defect. Being &s;o often &s;truck with in&s;tances of one &s;pecies of deformity, men think they can never keep at too great a di&s;tance from it, and wi&s;h always to have a leaning to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. In like manner, were the door opened to &s;elf-prai&s;e, and were MONTAIGNE's maxim ob&s;erved, that one &s;hould &s;ay as frankly, <HI>I have &s;en&s;e, I have learning, I have cou|rage, beauty, or wit;</HI> as 'tis &s;ure we often think &s;o; were this the ca&s;e, I &s;ay, every one is &s;en&s;ible, that &s;uch a flood of im|pertinence would break in upon us, as would render &s;ociety wholly intolerable. For this rea&s;on cu&s;tom has e&s;tabli&s;hed it as a rule, in common &s;ocieties, that men &s;hould not indulge them|&s;elves in &s;elf-prai&s;e, nor even &s;peak much of them&s;elves; and 'tis only among intimate friends or people of very manly behaviour, that one is allowed to do him&s;elf ju&s;tice. No body finds fault with MAURICE, prince of ORANGE, for his reply to one, who a&s;ked him whom he e&s;teemed the fir&s;t general of the age, <HI>The marquis de</HI> SPINOLA, &s;aid he, <HI>is the &s;econd.</HI> Tho' 'tis ob&s;erv|able, that the &s;elf-prai&s;e implied is here better implied, than if it had been directly expre&s;&s;ed, without any cover or di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be a very &s;uperficial thinker, who imagines, that all in&s;tances of mutual deference are to be under&s;tood in earne&s;t, and that a man would be more e&s;teemable for being ignorant of his own merits and accompli&s;hments. A &s;mall bya&s;s towards mode&s;ty, even in the internal &s;entiments, is favourably regarded, e&s;pecially in young people; and a &s;trong bya&s;s is required in the outward behaviour: But this excludes not a noble pride and &s;pirit, which may openly di&s;play it&s;elf in its full extent, when one lies under calumny or oppre&s;&s;ion of any kind. The generous contumacy of SOCRATES, as CICERO calls it, has been highly celebrated in all ages; and when joined to the u&s;ual mode&s;ty of his behaviour, forms a mo&s;t &s;hining character. IPHICRATES, the ATHENIAN general, being accu&s;ed of betraying the intere&s;ts of his country, a&s;ked his accu&s;er, <HI>Would you,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>on a like occa&s;ion, have been guilty of that crime? By no means,</HI> replied the other. <HI>And can you then imagine,</HI> cried the hero, <HI>that</HI> IPHJCRA|TES <HI>would be guilty?</HI> QUINCTIL. lib. 5. cap. 12. In &s;hort, a generous &s;pirit and &s;elf-value, well $ounded, decently di&s;gui&s;ed, and courageou&s;ly &s;upported under di&s;tre&s;s and calumny, is a very great virtue, and &s;eems to derive its merit from the noble eleva|tion of its &s;entiment, or its immediate agreeablene&s;s to its po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or. In ordinary characters, we approve of a bya&s;s towards mode&s;ty, which is a quality immediately agreeable to others: The vicious exce&s;s of the former virtue, viz. in&s;olence or haugh|tine&s;s, is immediately di&s;agreeable to others: The exce&s;s of the latter is &s;o to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or.

di&s;tinctions which you met with; as if the&s;e were
not things of cour&s;e, and what we could readily, of
our&s;elves, have imagined, without being told of
them?</P>
<P>DECENCY, or a proper regard to age, &s;ex, cha|racter
and &s;tation in the world, may be ranked among
the qualities, which are immediately agreeable to
others, and which, by that means, acquire prai&s;e and
approbation. An effeminate behaviour in a man, a
rough manner in a woman; the&s;e are ugly, becau&s;e
un&s;uitable to each character, and different from the
qualities which we expect in the &s;exes. 'Tis as if a
tragedy abounded in comic beauties, or a comedy in
tragic. The di&s;proportions hurt the eye, and convey
a d&s;agreeable &s;entiment to the &s;pectators, the &s;ource
of blame and di&s;approbation. This is that <HI>indecorum,</HI>
which is explained &s;o much at large by CICERO in
his Offices.</P>
<P>AMONG the other virtues, we may al&s;o give
CLEANLINESS a place; &s;ince it naturally renders
us agreeable to others, and is no incon&s;iderable &s;ource
of love and affection. No one will deny, that a ne|gligence
in this particular is a $ault; and as faults are
<PB N="167" REF="166">
nothing but &s;maller vices, and this fault can have no
other origin than the unea&s;y &s;en&s;ation, which it ex|cites
in others; we may, in this in&s;tance, &s;eemingly
&s;o trivia$, clearly di&s;cover the origin of moral di&s;tinc|tions,
about which the learned have involved them|&s;elves
in &s;uch mazes of perplexity and error.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides all the <HI>agreeable</HI> qualities, the origin
of who&s;e beauty we can, in &s;ome degree, explain
and account for, there &s;till remains &s;omething my&s;te|rious
and inexplicable, which conveys an immediate
&s;atis&s;action to the &s;pectator, but how, or why, or
for what rea&s;on, he cannot pretend to determine.
There is a MANNER, a grace, a genteelne&s;s, an
I-know-not-what, which &s;ome men po&s;&s;e&s;s above
others, which is very different from external beauty
and comeline&s;s, and which, however, catches our af|fection
almo&s;t as &s;uddenly and powerfully. And tho'
this <HI>manner</HI> be chie&s;ly talked of in the pa&s;&s;ion between
the &s;exes, where the concealed magic is ea&s;ily ex|plained,
yet &s;urely much of it prevails in all our e&s;ti|mation
of characters, and forms no incon&s;iderable
part of per&s;onal merit. This cla&s;s of virtues, there|fore,
mu&s;t be tru&s;ted entirely to the blind, but &s;ure
te&s;timony of ta&s;te and &s;entiment; and mu&s;t be con|&s;idered
as a part of ethics, left by nature to baffle
all the pride of philo&s;ophy, and make her &s;en&s;ible of
her narrow boundaries and &s;lender acqui&s;itions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167">
WE approve of another, becau&s;e of his wit, po|litene&s;s,
mode&s;ty, decency, or any agreeable quality
which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es; altho' he be not of our acquain|tance,
nor has ever given us any entertainment, by
means of the&s;e accompli&s;hments. The idea, which
we form of their effect on his acquaintance, has an
agreeable influence on our imagination, and gives us
the &s;entiment of approbation. This principle enters
into all the judgments, which we form concerning
morals.</P>

<P>IT may ju&s;tly appear &s;urprizing, that any man, in
&s;o late an age, &s;hould find it requi&s;ite to prove, by
elaborate rea&s;onings, that VIRTUE or PERSONAL
MERIT con&s;i&s;ts altogether in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mental
qualities, <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>per&s;on him&s;elf</HI> or to
<HI>others.</HI> It might be expected that this principle
would have occured even to the fir&s;t rude, unpracti&s;ed
enquirers concerning morals, and been received from
its own evidence, without any argument or di&s;puta|tion.
Whatever is valuable in any kind, &s;o natural|ly
cla&s;&s;es it&s;elf under the divi&s;ion of <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>agreeable,</HI>
the <HI>utile</HI> or the <HI>dulce,</HI> that 'tis not ea&s;y to imagine,
why we &s;hould ever &s;eek farther, or con&s;ider the que|&s;tion
as a matter of nice re&s;earch or enquiry. And as
every thing u&s;eful or agreeable mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e
qualities with regard either to the <HI>per&s;on him&s;elf</HI> or to
<PB N="170" REF="169">
<HI>others,</HI> the compleat delineation or de&s;cription of merit
&s;eems to be performed as naturally as a &s;hadow is ca&s;t

the ground, on which the &s;hadow is ca&s;t, be not
broken and uneven; nor the &s;urface, from which the
image is reflected, di&s;turbed and confu&s;ed; a ju&s;t
figure is immediately pre&s;ented, without any art or

that &s;y&s;tems and hypothe&s;es have perverted our natu|ral
under&s;tanding; when a theory, &s;o &s;imple and ob|vious,
could &s;o long have e&s;caped the mo&s;t elaborate

<P>BUT however the ca&s;e may have fared with philo|&s;ophy;
in common life, the&s;e principles are &s;till im|plicitly
maintained, nor is any other topic of prai&s;e
or blame ever recurred to, when we employ any pa|negyric
or &s;atyr, any applau&s;e or cen&s;ure of human
action and behaviour. If we ob&s;erve men, in every

You are very happy, we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e one to

in a circle of the gaye&s;t company, and he wa, the
very life and &s;oul of our conver&s;ation: So much wit

I have never before ob&s;erved in any one<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Qualities immediately agreeable to others.</NOTE>.
You would admire him &s;till more, &s;ays a fourth, if
you knew him more familiarly. That cheerfulne&s;s,
which you might remark in him, is not a &s;udden fla&s;h
&s;truck out by company: It runs through the whole
tenor of his life, and pre&s;erves a perpetual &s;erenity
on his countenance, and tranquillity in his &s;oul. He
has met with &s;evere trials, misfortunes, as well as
dangers; and by his greatne&s;s of mind, was &s;till &s;u|perior
to all of them<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Qualities immediately agreeable to the per&s;on him&s;elf.</NOTE> The image, gentlemen,
<PB N="172" REF="171">
which you have here delineated of CLEANTHES, cry
I, is that of accompli&s;hed merit. Each of you has

have unawares exceeded all the pictures drawn by
GRATIAN or CASTIGLIONE. A philo&s;opher might
&s;elect this character as a model of perfect virtue.</P>
<P>AND as every quality, which is u&s;e&s;ul or agree|able
to our&s;elves or others, is, in common life, al|lowed
to be a part of per&s;onal merit; &s;o no other
will ever be received, where men judge of things by
their natural, unprejudiced rea&s;on, without the delu|&s;ive
glo&s;&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition and fal&s;e religion. Celi|bacy,
fa&s;ting, penances, mortification, &s;elf-denial,
humility, &s;ilence, &s;olitude, and the whole train of
monki&s;h virtues; for what rea&s;on are they every
where rejected by men of &s;en&s;e, but becau&s;e they
&s;erve no manner of purpo&s;e; neither advance a man's
fortune in the world, nor render him a more valuable
member of &s;ociety; neither qualify him for the enter|tainment
of company, nor encrea&s;e his power of &s;elf|enjoyment?
We ob&s;erve, on the contrary, that they
cro&s;s all the&s;e de&s;irable ends; &s;tupify the under&s;tanding
and harden the heart, ob&s;cure the fancy and four
the temper. We ju&s;tly, therefore, transfer them to
the oppo&s;ite column, and place them in the catalogue
of vices; nor has any &s;uper&s;tition force &s;ufficient,
among men of the world, to pervert entirely the&s;e na|tural
<PB N="173" REF="172">
&s;entiments. A gloomy, hair-brained enthu&s;ia&s;t,
after his death, may have place in the calendar; but
will &s;carce ever be admitted, when alive, into intima|cy
and &s;ociety, except by tho&s;e who are as delirious
and di&s;mal as him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I$ &s;eems a happine&s;s in the pre&s;ent theory, that it
enters not into that vulgar di&s;pute concerning the
<HI>degrees</HI> of benevolen$e or &s;elf-love, which prevail in
human nature; a di&s;pute which is never likely to
have any i&s;&s;ue, both becau&s;e men, who have taken
party, are not ea&s;ily convinced, and becau&s;e the phe|nomena,
which can be produced on either &s;ide, are
&s;o di&s;per&s;ed, &s;o uncertain, and &s;ubject to &s;o many in|terpretations,
that 'tis &s;earce po&s;&s;ible accurately to
compare them, or draw from them any determinate
in&s;erence or conclu&s;ion. 'Tis &s;ufficient for our pre|&s;ent
purpo&s;e, if it be allowed, what &s;urely, without
the greate&s;t ab&s;urdity, cannot be di&s;puted, that there
is &s;ome benevolence, however &s;mall, inf&s;ued into our
bo&s;om; &s;ome &s;park of friend&s;hip for human kind;
&s;ome particle of the dove, kneaded into our frame,
together with the elements of the wolf and &s;erpent.
Let the&s;e generous &s;entiments be &s;uppo&s;ed ever &s;o
weak; let them be in&s;ufficient to move even a hand
or finger of our body; they mu&s;t &s;till direct the de|terminations
of our mind, and where every thing el&s;e
is equal, produce a cool preference of what is u&s;eful and
$erviceable to mankind, above what is pernicious and
<PB N="174" REF="173">
dangerous. A <HI>moral di&s;tinction,</HI> therefore, imme|diately
ari&s;es; a general &s;entiment of blame and ap|probation;
a tendency, however faint, to the objects
of the one, and a proportionable aver&s;ion to tho&s;e of
the other. Nor will tho&s;e rea&s;oners, who &s;o earne&s;tly
maintain the predominant &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of human kind,
be any way &s;candalized at hearing of the weak &s;enti|ments
of virtue, implanted in our nature. On the
contrary, they are found as ready to maintain the one
tenet as the other, and their &s;pirit of &s;atyre (for &s;uch
it appears, rather than of corruption) naturally gives
ri&s;e to both opinions; which have, indeed, a great
and almo&s;t indi&s;&s;$luble connection together.</P>
<P>AVARICE, ambition, vanity, and all pa&s;&s;ions, vul|garly,
though improperly, comprized under the de|nomination
of <HI>&s;elf-love,</HI> are here excluded from our
theory concerning the origin of morals, not becau&s;e
they are too weak, but becau&s;e they have not a pro|per
direction, for that purpo&s;e. The notion of morals
implies &s;ome &s;entiment common to all mankind,
which recommends the &s;ame object to general appro|bation,
and makes every man, or mo&s;t men, agree in
the &s;ame opinion or deci&s;ion concerning it. It al&s;o
implies &s;ome &s;entiment, &s;o univer&s;al and comprehen|&s;ive
as to extend to all mankind, and render the ac|tions
and conduct, even of the per&s;ons the mo&s;t re|mote,
an object of applau&s;e or cen&s;ure, according as
they agree or di&s;agree with that rule of right, which
<PB N="175" REF="174">
is e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e two requi&s;ite circum&s;tances be|long
alone to the &s;entiment of humanity here in&s;i&s;ted
on. The other pa&s;&s;ions produce, in every brea&s;t,
many &s;trong &s;entiments of de&s;ire and aver&s;ion, affec|tion
and hatred; but the&s;e neither are felt &s;o much in
common, nor are &s;o comprchen&s;ive, as to be the
foundation of any general &s;y&s;tem and e&s;tabli&s;hed theory
of blame or approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN a man denominates another his <HI>enemy,</HI> his
<HI>rival,</HI> his <HI>antagoni&s;t,</HI> his <HI>adver&s;ary,</HI> he is under&s;tood
to &s;peak the lauguage of &s;elf-love, and to expre&s;s &s;en|timents,
peculiar to him&s;elf, and ari&s;ing from his par|ticular
cirum&s;tances and &s;ituation. But when he be|&s;tows
on any man the epithets of <HI>vi$ious</HI> or <HI>o$$ous</HI> or
<HI>deparved,</HI> he then &s;peaks another language, and ex|pre&s;&s;es
&s;entiments, in which, he expects, all his au|dience
are to concur with him. He mu&s;t here, there|fore,
depart from his private and particular &s;ituation,
and mu&s;t choo&s;e a point of view, common to him with
others: He mu&s;t move &s;ome univer&s;al principle of the
human frame, and touch a &s;tring, to which all man|kind
have an accord and &s;ymphony. If he means,
therefore, to expre&s;s, that this man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es quali|ties,
who&s;e tendency is pernicious to &s;ociety, he has
cho&s;en this common point of view, and has touched
the principle of humanity, in which every man, in
&s;ome degree, concurs. While the human heart is
compounded of the &s;ame elements as at pre&s;ent, it
<PB N="176" REF="175">
will never be wholly indifferent to the good of man|kind,
nor entirely unaffected with the tendencies of
characters and manners. And though this affection
of humanity may not generally be e&s;teemed &s;o &s;trong,
as vanity or ambition, yet, being common to all
men, it can alone be the foundation of morals, or of
any general &s;y&s;tem of conduct and behaviour. One
man's ambition is not another's ambition; nor will
the fame event or object &s;atisfy both: But the huma|nity
of one man is the humanity of every one; and
the &s;ame object touches this pa&s;&s;ion in all human
creatures.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;entiments, which ari&s;e from humanity, are
not only the &s;ame in all human creatures, and produce
the &s;ame approbation or cen&s;ure; but they al&s;o com|prehend
all human creatures; nor is there any one,
who&s;e conduct or character is not, by their means, an
object, to every one, of cen&s;ure or approbation. On
the contrary, tho&s;e other pa&s;&s;ions, commonly deno|minated
&s;elfi&s;h, both produce different &s;entiments in
each individual, according to his particular &s;ituation;
and al&s;o contemplate the greate&s;t part of mankind with
the utmo&s;t indifference and unconcern. Whoever has
a high regard and e&s;teem for me fiatters my vanity;
whoever expre&s;&s;es contempt mortifies and di&s;plea&s;es
me: But as my name is known but to a &s;mall part of
mankind, there are few, who come within the &s;phere
of this pa&s;&s;ion, or excite, on its account, either my
<PB N="177" REF="176">
affection or di&s;gu&s;t. But if you repre&s;ent a tyrannical,
in&s;olent, or barbarous behaviour, in any country
or in any age of the world; I &s;oon carry my eye to
the pernicious tendency of &s;uch a conduct, and feel
the &s;entiments of repugnance and di&s;plea&s;ure towards
it. No character can be &s;o remote as to be, in this
light, wholly indifferent to me. What is beneficial to
&s;ociety or to the per&s;on him&s;elf mu&s;t &s;till be preferred.
And every quality or action, of every human being,
mu&s;t, by this means, be ranked under &s;ome cla&s;s
or denomination, expre&s;&s;ive of general cen&s;ure or
applau&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT more, therefore, can we a&s;k to di&s;tingui&s;h
the &s;entiments, dependant on humanity, from tho&s;e
connected with any other pa&s;&s;ion, or to &s;atisfy us,
why the former are the origin of morals, and not the
latter? Whatever conduct gains my approbation, by
touching my humanity, procures al&s;o the applau&s;e of
all mankind, by affecting the &s;ame principle in
them: But what &s;erves my avarice or ambition
plea&s;es only the&s;e pa&s;&s;tions in me, and affects not the
avarice and ambi$ion of the re&s;t of mankind. No
conduct in any man, which has a bene&s;icial tendency,
but is agreeable to my humanity, however remote
the per&s;on: But every man, &s;o far removed as neither
to cro&s;s nor &s;erve my avarice and ambition, is re|garded
as wholly indifferent by tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions. The
di&s;tinction, therefore, betwixt the&s;e &s;pecies of &s;enti|ment
<PB N="178" REF="177">
being &s;o great and evident, language mu&s;t &s;oon
be moulded upon it, and mu&s;t invent a peculiar &s;et of
terms, in order to expre&s;s tho&s;e univer&s;al &s;entiments
of cen&s;ure or approbation, which ari&s;e from huma|nity,
or from views of general u&s;efulne&s;s and its con|trary.
VIRTUE and VICE become then known:
Morals are recognized: Certain general ideas are
framed of human conduct and behaviour: Such mea|&s;ures
are expected from men, in &s;uch &s;ituations:
This action is determined to be conformable to our
ab&s;tract rule; that other, contrary. And by &s;uch
univer&s;al principles are the particular &s;entiments of
&s;elf-love frequently controuled and limited<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It &s;eems certain, both from rea&s;on and experience, that a rude, untaught &s;avage regulates chiefly his love and hatred by the ideas of private utility and injury, and has but faint conceptions of a general rule or &s;y&s;tem of behaviour. The man who &s;tands oppo&s;ite to him in battle, he hates heartily, not only for the pre&s;ent moment, which is almo&s;t unavoidable, but for ever after; nor is he &s;atisfied without the mo&s;t extreme puni&s;hment and vengeance. But we, accu&s;tomed to &s;ociety, and to more enlarged reflections, con&s;ider, that this man is &s;erving his own country and community; that any man, in the &s;ame &s;ituation, would do the &s;ame; that we our&s;elves, in like circum&s;tances, ob&s;erve a like conduct; that in general human &s;ociety is be&s;t &s;upported on &s;uch, maxims: And by the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions and views, we correct, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, our ruder and narrower pa&s;&s;ions. And though much of our friend&s;hip and enmity be &s;till regulated by private con&s;iderations of benefit and harm, we pay, at lea&s;t, this homage to general rules, which we are accu&s;tomed to re|&s;pect, that we commonly pervert our adver&s;ary's conduct, by imputing malice or inju&s;tice to him, in order to give vent to tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, which ari&s;e from &s;elf-love and private intere&s;t. When the heart is full of rage, it never wants pretexts of this nature; though &s;ometimes as frivolous, as tho&s;e, from which HORACE, being almo&s;t cru&s;hed by the fall of a tree, affects to occu&s;e of parricide the fir&s;t planter of it.</NOTE>.</P>

FROM in&s;tances of popular tumults, &s;editions, fac|tions,
panics, and of all pa&s;&s;ions, which are &s;hared
with a multitude; we may learn the influence of &s;o|ciety,
in exciting and &s;upporting any emotion; while
the mo&s;t ungovernable di&s;orders are rai&s;ed, we find,
by that means, from the &s;lighte&s;t and mo&s;t frivolous
occa&s;ions. SOLON was no very cruel, though, per|haps,
an unju&s;t legi&s;lator, who puni&s;hed neutrers in
civil wars; and few, I believer, would, in &s;uch ca&s;es,
incur the penalty, were their affection and di&s;cour&s;e
allowed &s;ufficient to ab&s;olve them. No &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s,
and &s;carce any philo&s;ophy, have there force &s;ufficient
to &s;upport a total coolne&s;s and indifference; and he
mu&s;t be more or le&s;s than man, who kindles not in
the common blaze. What wonder then, that moral
&s;entiments are found of &s;uch influence in life; though
&s;pringing from principles, which may appear, at fir&s;t
&s;ight, &s;omewhat &s;mall and delicate? But the&s;e princi|ples,
we mu&s;t-remark, are &s;ocial and univer&s;al: They
<PB N="180" REF="179">
form, in a manner, the <HI>party</HI> of human-kind again&s;t
vice or di&s;order, its common enemy: And as the be|nevolent
concern for others is diffu&s;ed, in a greater or
le&s;s degree, over all men, and is the &s;ame in all, it
occurs more frequently in di&s;cour&s;e, is cheri&s;hed by
&s;ociety and conver&s;ation, and the blame and approba|tion,
con&s;equent on it, are thereby rouzed from that
lethargy, into which they are probaly lulled, in &s;oli|tary
and uncultivated nature. Other pa&s;&s;ions, tho'
perhaps originally &s;tronger, yet being &s;elfi&s;h and pri|vate,
are often overpowered by its force, and yield
the dominon of our brea&s;t to tho&s;e &s;ocial and public
principles.</P>
<P>ANOTHER &s;pring of our con&s;titution, that brings
great addition of force to moral &s;entiment, is, the
love of fame; which rules, with &s;uch uncontrolled
authority, in all generous minds, and is often the
grand object of all their de&s;igns and undertakings. By
our continual and earne&s;t pur&s;uit of a character, a
name, a reputation in the world, we bring our own
deportment and conduct frequently in review, and
con&s;ider how they appear in the eyes of tho&s;e, who
approach and regard us. This con&s;tant habit of &s;ur|veying
our&s;elf, as it were, in reflection, keeps

&s;ink gradually in their value; while every in|ward
beauty and moral grace is &s;tudiou&s;ly acquired,
and the mind is accompli&s;hed in each perfection, which
can adorn or embelli&s;h a rational creature.</P>
<P>HERE is the mo&s;t perfect morality with which we
are acquainted: Here is di&s;played the force of many
&s;ympathies. Our moral &s;entiment is it&s;elf a feeling
chiefly of that nature: And our regard to a character
with others &s;eems to ari&s;e only from a care of pre&s;erv|ing
a character with our&s;elves, and to obtain this end,
we find it nece&s;&s;ary to prop our tottering judgment on
the corre&s;pondent approbation of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to accommodate matters, and re|move,
if po&s;&s;ible, every difficulty, let us allow all
the&s;e rea&s;onings to be fal&s;e. Let us allow, that when
we re&s;olve the plea&s;ure, which ari&s;es from views of
utility, into the &s;entiments of humanity and &s;ympa|thy,
we have embraced a wrong hypothe&s;is. Let us
con&s;e&s;s it nece&s;&s;ary to find &s;ome other explication of
that applau&s;e, which is paid to objects, whether in|animate,
animate, or rational, if they have a tenden|cy
to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind.
However difficult it be to conceive, that an object is
approved of, on account of its tendency to a certain
end, while the end it&s;elf is totally indifferent; let us
&s;wallow this ab&s;urdity, and con&s;ider what are the con|&s;equences.
The preceding delineation or definition of
<PB N="182" REF="181">
VIRTUE mu&s;t &s;till retain its evidence and authority:
It mu&s;t &s;till be allowed, that every quality of the
mind, which is <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>per&s;on him&s;elf</HI>
or to <HI>others,</HI> communicates a plea&s;ure to the &s;pectator,
engages his e&s;teem, and is admitted under the honour|able
denomination of virtue or merit. Are not ju&s;tice,
fidelity, honour, veracity, allegiance, cha&s;tity, e&s;|teemed
&s;olely on account of their tendency to pro|mote
the good of &s;ociety? Is not that tendency in&s;e|parable
from humanity, benevolence, lenity, genero|&s;ity,
gratitude, moderation, tenderne&s;s, friend&s;hip,
and all the other &s;ocial virtues? Can it po&s;&s;ibly be
doubted, that indu&s;try, di&s;cretion, frugality, &s;ecrecy,
order, per&s;everance, forethought, judgment, and the
whole cla&s;s of virtues, of which many pages would
not contain the catalogue; can it be doubted, I &s;ay,
that the tendency of the&s;e virtues to promote the in|tere&s;t
and happine&s;s of their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, is the &s;ole
foundation of their merit? Who can di&s;pute that a
mind, which &s;upports a perpetual &s;erenity and cheer|fulne&s;s,
a noble dignity and undaunted &s;pirit, a tender
affection and good-will to all around; as it has more
enjoyment within it&s;elf, is al&s;o a more animating and
rejoicing &s;pectacle, than if dejected with melancholy,
tormented with anxiety, irritated with rage, or &s;unk
into the mo&s;t abject ba&s;ene&s;s and degeneracy? And
as to the qualities, immediately <HI>agreeable to others,</HI>
they &s;peak &s;ufficiently for them&s;elves; and he mu&s;t be
unhappy, indeed, either in his own temper, or in his
<PB N="183" REF="182">
&s;ituation and circum&s;tances, who has never perceived
the charms of a facetious wit or flowing affability, of a
delicate mode&s;ty or decent genteelne&s;s of addre&s;s and

<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible, that nothing can be more unphilo&s;o|phical
than to be po&s;itive or dogmatical on any &s;ub|ject;
and that, even if <HI>exce&s;&s;ive</HI> &s;ceptici&s;m could be
maintained, it would not be more de&s;tructive to all
ju&s;t rea&s;oning and enquiry. I am convinced, that,
where men are the mo&s;t &s;ure and arrogant, they are
commonly the mo&s;t mi&s;taken, and have there given
reins to pa&s;&s;ion, without that proper deliberation and
&s;u&s;pence, which can alone &s;ecure them from the gro&s;|&s;e&s;t
ab&s;urdities. Yet I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this enume|ration
puts the matter in &s;o &s;trong a light, that I can|not,
<HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> be more a&s;&s;ured of any truth, which
I learn from rea&s;oning and argument, than that vir|tue
con&s;i&s;ts entirely in the u&s;efulne&s;s or agreeablene&s;s
of qualities to the per&s;on him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, or
to others, who have any intercour&s;e with him. But
when I reflect, that, though the bulk and figure of the
earth have been mea&s;ured and delineated, though the
motions of the tides have been accounted for, the or|der
and oeconomy of the heavenly bodies &s;ubjected to
their proper laws, and INFINITE it&s;elf reduced to
calculation; yet men &s;till di&s;pute concerning the foun|dation
of their moral duties: When I reflect on this,
I &s;ay, I fall back into diffidence and &s;ceptici&s;m, and

&s;u&s;pect, that an hypothe&s;is, &s;o obvious, had it been a

<P>HAVING explained the moral <HI>approbation</HI> attending
virtue, there remains nothing, but to con&s;ider briefly
our intere&s;ted <HI>obligation</HI> to it, and to enquire, whether
every man, who has any regard to his own happine&s;s
and welfare, will not be&s;t find his account in the prac|tice
of every moral duty. If this can be clearly a&s;|certained
from the foregoing theory, we &s;hall have
the &s;atisfaction to reflect, that we have advanced prin|ciples,
which not only, 'tis hoped, will &s;$and the te&s;t
of rea&s;oning and enquiry, but may contribute to the
amendment of men's lives, and their improvement in
morality and &s;ocial virtue. And though the philo&s;o|phical
truth of any propo&s;ition by no means depends
on its tendency to promote the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety;
yet a man has but a bad grace, who delivers a theory,
however true, which, he mu&s;t confe&s;s, leads to a
practice dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into
tho&s;e corners of nature, which &s;pread a nui&s;ance all
areound? Why dig up the pe&s;tilene from the pit,
in which it is buried? The ingenuity of your re&s;ear|ches
may be admired; but your &s;y&s;tems will be dete&s;|ted:
And mankind will agree, if they cannot re|fute
<PB N="185" REF="184">
them, to &s;ink them, at lea&s;t, in eternal &s;ilence
and oblivion. Truths, which are <HI>pernicious</HI> to &s;ociety,
if any &s;uch there be, will yield to errors, which are
&s;alutary and <HI>advantageous.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what philo&s;ophical truths can be more advan|tageous
to &s;ociety, than tho&s;e here delivered, which
repre&s;ent virtue in all her genuine and mo&s;t engaging
charms, and make us approach her with ea&s;e, fami|liarity,
and affection? The di&s;mal dre&s;s falls off,
with which many divines, and &s;ome philo&s;ophers
had covered her; and nothing appears but gentle|ne&s;s,
humanity, bene&s;icence, affability; nay even,
at proper intervals, play, frolic, and gaiety. She
talks not of u&s;ele&s;s au$terities and rigours, &s;uffering
and &s;elf-denial. She declares, that her &s;ole purpo&s;e
is, to make her votaries and all mankind, during
every in&s;tant of their exi&s;tence, if po&s;tible, cheerful
and happy; nor does &s;he ever willingly part with
any plea&s;ure but in hopes of ample compen&s;ation in
&s;ome other period of their lives. The &s;ole trouble
which &s;he demands is that of ju&s;t calculation, and a
&s;teady preference of the greater happine&s;s. And if any
au&s;tere pretenders approach her, enemies to joy and
plea&s;ure, &s;he either rejects them as hypocrites and
deceivers; or if &s;he admits them in her train,
they are ranked, however, among the lea&s;t favoured
of her votaries.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="185">
AND indeed, to drop all figurative expre&s;&s;ion, what
hopes can we ever have of engaging mankind to a
practice, which we confe&s;s full of au&s;terity and rigour$
Or what morality can ever &s;erve any u&s;eful purpo&s;e,
unle&s;s it can &s;how, by a particular detail, that all the
duties, which it recommends, are al&s;o the true inte|re&s;t
of each individual? The peculiar advantage of
the foregoing theory, &s;eems to be, that it furni&s;hes
proper mediums for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>THAT the virtues which are immediately <HI>u&s;eful</HI> or
<HI>agreeable</HI> to the per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of them, are de&s;ire|able
in a view to &s;elf-intere&s;t, it would &s;urely be &s;u|perfluous
to prove. Morali&s;ts indeed, may &s;pare them|&s;elves
all the pains, which they often take in recom|mending
the&s;e duties. To what purpo&s;e collect argu|ments
to evince, that temperance is advantageous,
and the exce&s;&s;es of plea&s;ure hurtful? When it appears,
that the&s;e exce&s;&s;es are only denominated &s;uch, becau&s;e
they are hurtful; and that, if the unlimited u&s;e of &s;trong
liquors, for in&s;tance, no more impaired health or the
faculties of the mind and body than the u&s;e of air or
water, it would not be a whit more vicious or blame|able.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems equally &s;uperfluous to prove, that the
<HI>companionable</HI> virtues of good manners and wit, de|cency
and genteelne&s;s, are more de&s;irable than the
contrary qualities. Vanity alone, without other con|&s;iderations,
<PB N="187" REF="186">
is a &s;ufficient motive to make us wi&s;h the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e accompli&s;hments. No man was
ever willingly deficient in this particular. All our
failures here proceed from bad education, want of ca|pacity,
or a perver&s;e and unpliable di&s;po&s;ition.
Would you have your company coveted, admired,
followed; rather than hated, de&s;pi&s;ed, avoided? Can
any one &s;eriou&s;ly deliberate in the ca&s;e? As no enjoy|ment
is &s;incere, without &s;ome reference to company
and &s;ociety; &s;o no &s;ociety can be agreeable or even
tolerable, where a man feels his pre&s;ence unwelcome,
and di&s;covers all around him &s;ymptoms of di&s;gu&s;t and
aver&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT why, in the greater &s;ociety or confederacy of
mankind, &s;hould not the ca&s;e be the &s;ame as in parti|cular
clubs and companies? Why is it more doubtful,
that the enlarged virtues of humanity, genero&s;ity,
beneficence, are de&s;irable with a view to happine&s;s and
&s;elf-intere&s;t, than the limited endowments of ingenui|ty
and politene&s;s? Are we apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t tho&s;e
&s;ocial affections have a greater and more immediate
interference, than any other pur&s;uits, with private
utility, and cannot be gratified, without &s;ome impor|tant
&s;acrifices of honour and advantage? If &s;o, we are
but ill in&s;tructed in the nature of the human pa&s;&s;ions,
and are more influenced by verbal di&s;tinctions than by
real differences.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187">
WHATEVER contradiction may vulgarly be &s;up|po&s;ed
betwixt the <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> and <HI>&s;ocial</HI> &s;entiments or dif|po&s;itions,
they are really no more oppo&s;ite than &s;elfi&s;h
and ambitious, &s;elfi&s;h and revengeful, &s;elfi&s;h and vain.
'Tis requi&s;ite, that there be an original propen&s;ity of
&s;ome kind, in order to be a ba&s;is to &s;elf-love, by giv|ing
a reli&s;h to the objects of its pur&s;uit; and none
more fit for this purpo&s;e than benevolence or humani|ty.
The goods of fortune are &s;pent in one gratifica|tion
or other: The mi&s;er, who accumulates his annual
income, and lends it out at intere&s;t, han really &s;pent
it in the gratification of his avarice. And it would be
difficult to &s;how, why a man is more a lo&s;er by a ge|nerous
action, than by any other method of expence;
&s;ince the utmo&s;t which he can attain, by the mo&s;t ela|borte
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, is the indulgence of &s;ome affection.</P>
<P>NOW if life, without pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be altogether in|&s;ipid
and tire&s;ome; let a man &s;uppo&s;e that he has full
power of modelling his own di&s;po&s;ition, and let him
deliberate what appetite or de&s;ire he would choo&s;e for
the foundation of his happine&s;s and enjoyment.
Every affection, he would ob&s;erve, when gratified by
&s;ucce&s;s, gives a &s;atisfaction proportioned to its force
and violence; but be&s;ides this advantage, common to
all, the immediate feeling of benevolence and friend|&s;hip,
humanity and kindne&s;s, is &s;weet, &s;mooth, ten|der,
and agreeable, independent of all fortune and
accidents. The&s;e virtues are be&s;ides attended with a
<PB N="189" REF="188">
plea&s;ing con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s or remembrance, and keep us
in humour with our&s;elves as well as others; while we
retain the agreeable reflection of having done our part
towards mankind and &s;ociety. And though all men
&s;how a jealou&s;y of our &s;ucce&s;s in the pur&s;uits of avarice
and ambition; yet are we almo&s;t &s;ure of their good-will
and good-wi&s;hes, &s;o long as we per&s;evere in the
paths of virtue, and employ our&s;elves in the execution
of generous plans and purpo&s;es. What other pa&s;&s;ion
is there where we &s;hall find &s;o many advantages
united; an agreeable &s;entiment, a plea&s;ing con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s,
a good reputation? But of the&s;e truths, we may
ob&s;erve, men are, of them&s;elves, pretty much con|vinced;
nor are they deficient in their duty to &s;ociety,
becau&s;e they would not wi&s;h to be generous, friendly,
and humane; but becau&s;e they do not feel them&s;elves
&s;uch.</P>
<P>TREATING vice with the greate&s;t candour, and
making it all po&s;&s;ible conce&s;&s;ions, we mu&s;t acknow|ledge,
that there is not, in any in&s;tance, the &s;malle&s;t
pretext for giving it the preference above virtue, with
a view to &s;elf-intere&s;t; except, perhaps, in the ca&s;e of
ju&s;tice, where a man, taking things in a certain light,
may often &s;eem to be lo&s;er by his integrity. And
though it is allowed, that, without a regard to pro|perty,
no &s;ociety could &s;ub&s;i&s;t; yet according to the
imperfect way, in which human affairs are conducted,
a &s;en&s;ible knave, in particular incidents, may think,
<PB N="190" REF="189">
that an act of iniquity or infidelity will make a con|&s;iderable
addition to his fortune, without cau&s;ing any
con&s;iderable breach in the &s;ocial union and confedera|cy.
That <HI>hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy,</HI> may be a good ge|neral
rule; but is liable to many exceptions: And he,
it may, perhaps, be judged, conducts him&s;elf with
mo&s;t wi&s;dom, who ob&s;erves the general rule, and takes
advantage of all the exceptions.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that if a man thinks, that this rea|&s;oning
much requires an an&s;wer, it will be a little dif|ficult
to find any, which will to him appear &s;tisfactory
and convincing. If his heart rebels not again&s;t &s;uch
pernicious maxims, if he feels no reluctance to the
thoughts of villainy or ba&s;ene&s;s, he has indeed lo&s;t a
con&s;iderable motive to virtue; and we may expect,
that his practice will be an&s;werable to his &s;peculation.
But in all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to trea|chery
and roguery is too &s;trong to be counterballanced
by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage. In|ward
peace of mind, con&s;ciou&s;ne of integrity, a &s;a|tisfactory
view of our own conduct; the&s;e are circum|&s;tances
very requi&s;ite to happine&s;s, and will be cheri&s;h|ed
and cultivated by every hone&s;t man, who feels the
importance of them.</P>
<P>SUCH a one has, be&s;ides, the frequent &s;atisfaction of
&s;eeing knaves, with all their pretended cunning and
ability, betrayed by their own maxims; and while they
<PB N="191" REF="190">
purpo&s;e to cheat with moderation and &s;ecrecy, a
tempting incident occurs, nature is frail, and they
give into the &s;nare; whence they can never extricate
them&s;elves, without a total lo&s;s of reputation, and the
forfeiture of all future tru&s;t and confidence with man|kind.</P>
<P>BUT were they ever &s;o &s;ecret and &s;ucce&s;sful, the
hone&s;t man, if he has any tincture of philo&s;ophy, or
even common ob&s;ervation and reflection, will di&s;|cover,
that they them&s;elves are, in the end, the great|e&s;t
dupes, and have &s;acrificed the invaluable enjoyment
of a character, with them&s;elves at lea&s;t, for the acqui|&s;ition
of worthle&s;s toys and gewgaws. How little is
requi&s;ite to &s;upply the <HI>mce&s;&s;ities</HI> of nature? And in a
view to <HI>plea&s;ure,</HI> what compari&s;on between the un|bought
&s;atisfactions of conver&s;ation, &s;ociety, &s;tudy,
even health and the common beauties of nature, but
above all the peaceful reflection on one's own conduct:
What compari&s;on, I &s;ay, between the&s;e, and the fe|veri&s;h,
empty amu&s;ements of luxury and expence?
The&s;e natural plea&s;ures, indeed, are really without

pari&s;e or cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE chief foundation of moral prai&s;e being &s;up|po&s;ed

'tis evident, that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> mu&s;t enter for a con&s;iderable

but that faculty can in&s;truct us in the tendency
of qualities and actions, and point out their benefi|cial
con&s;equences to &s;ociety and to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.
In many ca&s;es, this is an affair liable to great contro|ver&s;y:
<PB N="194" REF="192">
Doubts may ari&s;e; oppo&s;ite intere&s;ts occur;
and a preference mu&s;t be given to one &s;ide, from very
nice views, and a &s;mall overballance of utility. This
is particularly remarkable in que&s;tions with regard to
ju&s;tice; as is, indeed, natural to &s;uppo&s;e, from that
&s;pecies of utility, which attends this virtue<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE> Were
every &s;ingle in&s;tance of ju&s;tice, like that of benevo|lence,
u&s;eful to &s;ociety; this would be a more &s;imple
&s;tate of the ca&s;e, and &s;eldom liable to great contro|ver&s;y.
But as &s;ingle in&s;tances of ju&s;tice are often
pernicious in their fir&s;t and immediate tendency, and
as the advantage to &s;ociety re&s;ults only from the ob|&s;ervance

and combination of &s;everal per&s;ons in the &s;ame equi|table
conduct; the ca&s;e here becomes more intricate
and involved. The various circum&s;tances of &s;ociety;
the various confequences of any practice; the various
intere&s;ts, which may be propo&s;ed: The&s;e on many
occa&s;ions are doubtful, and &s;ubject to great di&s;cu&s;&s;ion
and enquiry. The object of municipal laws is to fix
all que&s;tions with regard to ju&s;tice: The debates of
civilians; the reflections of politicians; the prece|dents

to the &s;ame purpo&s;e. And a very accurate <HI>rea&s;on</HI> or

amid&s;t &s;uch intricate doubts ari&s;ing from ob|&s;cure

<P><PB N="195" REF="193">
BUT tho' rea&s;on, when fully a&s;&s;i&s;ted and improved,
be &s;ufficient to in&s;truct us in the pernicious or u&s;eful
tendencies of qualities and actions; it is not alone
&s;ufficient to produce any moral blame or approbation.
Utility is only a tendency to a certain end; and were
the end totally indifferent to us, we &s;hould feel the
&s;ame indifference towards the means. 'Tis requi&s;ite a
<HI>&s;entiment</HI> &s;hould here di&s;play it&s;elf, in order to give a
preference to the u&s;eful above the pernicious tenden|cies.
This &s;entiment can be no other than a feeling
for the happine&s;s of mankind, and a re&s;entment of
their mi&s;ery; &s;ince the&s;e are the different ends, which
virtue and vice have a tendency to promote. Here,
therefore, <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in&s;tructs us in the &s;everal tendencies

impo&s;&s;ible, in any particular in&s;tance, that this hy|pothe&s;is
can &s;o much as be rendered intelligible;
whatever &s;pecious figure it may make in general de|clamations
and di&s;cour&s;es. Examine the crime of
<HI>ingratitude,</HI> for in&s;tance; which has place, wherever
we ob&s;erve good-will, expre&s;&s;ed and known together
with good offices performed, on the one &s;ide, and a
return of ill-will or indifference, with ill-offices or
neglect on the other: Anatomize all the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
and examine, by your rea&s;on alone, in what
con&s;i&s;ts the demerit or blame: You never will come
to any i&s;&s;ue or conclu&s;ion.</P>
<P>REASON judges either of <HI>matter of fact</HI> or of <HI>rela|tions.</HI>
Enquire then, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> where is that matter of
fact, which we here call <HI>crime;</HI> point it out; deter|mine
the time of its exi&s;tence; de&s;cribe its e&s;&s;ence or
nature; explain the &s;en&s;e or faculty, to which it di&s;|covers
it&s;elf. It re&s;ides in the mind of the per&s;on,
who is ungrateful. He mu&s;t, therefore, feel it, and
be con&s;cious of it. But nothing is there, except the
pa&s;&s;ion of ill-will or ab&s;olute indifference. You can|not
&s;ay, that the&s;e, of them&s;elves, always, and in all
circum&s;tances, are crimes. No: They are only
<PB N="197" REF="195">
crimes, when directed towards per&s;ons, who have
before expre&s;&s;ed and di&s;played good will towards us.
Confequently, we may infer, that the crime of in|gratitude
is not any particular individual <HI>fact;</HI> but
ari&s;es from a complication of circum&s;tances, which,
being pre&s;ented to the &s;pectator, excites the <HI>&s;entiment</HI>
of blame, by the particular &s;tructure and fabric of
his mind.</P>
<P>THIS repre&s;entation, you &s;ay, is fal&s;e. Crime,
indeed, con&s;i&s;ts not in a particular <HI>fact,</HI> of who&s;e re|ality
we are a&s;&s;ured by <HI>rea&s;on:</HI> But it con&s;i&s;ts in cer|tain
<HI>moral relations,</HI> di&s;covered by rea&s;on, in the &s;ame
manner as we di&s;cover, by rea&s;on, the truths of ge|ometry
or algebra. But what are the relations, I a&s;k,
of which you here talk? In the ca&s;e &s;tated above, I
&s;ee fir&s;t good will and good offices, in one per&s;on;
then ill-will and ill-offices in the other. Between
the&s;e, there is the relation of <HI>contrariety.</HI> Does the
crime con&s;i&s;t in that relation? But &s;uppo&s;e a per&s;on
bore me ill-will or did me ill-offices; and I, in re|turn,
were indifferent towards him, or did him good-offices:
Here is the &s;ame relation of <HI>contraritey;</HI> and
yet my conduct is often highly laudable. Twi&s;t and
turn this matter, as much as you will, you can never
re&s;t the morality on relation; but mu&s;t have recour&s;e
to the deci&s;ions of &s;entiment.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="196">
WHEN 'tis affirmed, that two and three are equal
to the half of ten; this relation of equality, I un|der&s;tand
perfectly. I conceive, that if ten be divided
into two parts, of which one has as many units as
the other; and if any of the&s;e parts be compared
to two added to three, it will contain as many units
as that compound number. But when you draw
thence a compari&s;on to moral relations, I own, that
I am altogether at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand you. A
moral action, a crime, &s;uch as ingratitude, is a com|plicated
object. Does the morality con&s;i&s;t in the
relation of its parts to each other. How? After
what manner? Specify the relation: Be more parti|cular
and explicite in your propo&s;itions; and you
will ea&s;ily &s;ee their fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>NO, &s;ay you, the morality con&s;i&s;ts in the relation
of actions to the rule of right; and they are deno|minated
good or ill, according as they agree or di&s;|agree
with it. What then is this rule of right? In
what does it con&s;i&s;t? How is it determined? By
rea&s;on, you'll &s;ay, which examines the moral relations
of actions. So that moral relations are determined
by the compari&s;on of actions to a rule. And that
rule is determined by con&s;idering the moral relations
of objects. Is not this fine rea&s;oning?</P>
<P>ALL this is metaphy&s;ics, you cry. That is
enough: There needs nothing more to give a &s;trong
pre&s;umption of fal&s;hood. Yes, replied I: Here are
<PB N="199" REF="197">
metaphy&s;ics &s;urely: But they are all on your &s;ide,
who advance an ab&s;tru&s;e hypothe&s;is, which can never
be made intelligible, nor quadrate with any parti|cular
in&s;tance or illu&s;tration. The hypothe&s;is which
we embrace is plain. It maintains, that morality is
determined by &s;entiment. It defines virtue to be,
<HI>whatever mental action or quality gives to a &s;pectator the
ple$&s;ing &s;entiment of approbation;</HI> and vice the contrary.
We then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
what actions have this influence: We con&s;ider all
the circum&s;tances, in which the&s;e actions agree: And
from thence endeavour to extract &s;ome general ob|&s;ervations
with regard to the&s;e &s;entiments. If you
call this metaphy&s;ics, and find any thing ab&s;tru&s;e here,
you need only conclude, that your turn of mind is
not &s;uited to the moral &s;ciences.</P>
<P>II. WHEN a man, at any time, deliberates con|cerning
his own conduct, (as, whether he had bet|ter,
in a particular emergence, a&s;&s;i&s;t a brother or a
benefactor) he mu&s;t con&s;ider the&s;e &s;eparate relations,
with the whole circum&s;tances and &s;ituation of the
per&s;ons, in order to determine the &s;uperior duty and
obligations: And in order to determine the propor|tion
of lines in any triangle, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to examine
the nature of that figure, and the relations, which its
&s;everal parts bear to each other. But notwith&s;tanding
this appearing &s;imilarity in the two ca&s;es, there is, at
the bottom, an extreme difference between them,
<PB N="200" REF="198">
A &s;peculative rea&s;oner concerning triangles or circles
con&s;iders the &s;everal known and given relations of
the parts of the&s;e figures; and from thence infers
&s;ome unknown relation, which is dependent on the
former. But in moral deliberations, we mu&s;t be ac|quainted,
before-hand, with all the objects, and all
the relations to each other; and from a compari&s;on
of the whole, fix our choice or approbation. No
new fact to be a&s;certained: No new relation to be
di&s;covered. The whole circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e are
&s;uppo&s;ed to be laid before us, ere we can fix any &s;en|tence
of blame or approbation. If any material
circum&s;tance be yet unknown or doubtful, we mu&s;t
fir&s;t employ our enquiry or intellectual faculties to
a&s;&s;u$e us of it; and mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend for a time all moral
deci&s;ion or &s;entiment. While we are ignorant, whe|ther
a man was aggre&s;&s;or or not, how can we deter|mine
whether the per&s;on, who killed him, be crimi|nal
or innocent? But after every circum&s;tance, every
relation is known, the under&s;tanding has no far|ther
room to operate, nor any object, on which it
could employ it&s;elf. The approbation or blame,
which then en&s;ues, cannot be the work of the judg|ment,
but of the heart; and is not a &s;peculative pro|po&s;ition
or affirmation, but an active feeling or &s;en|timent.
In the di&s;qui&s;itions of the under&s;tanding,
from known circum&s;tances and relations, we infer
&s;ome new and unknown. In moral deci&s;ions, the
<PB N="201" REF="199">
whole circum&s;tances and relations mu&s;t be antece|dently
known; and the mind, from the contempla|tion
of the whole, feels &s;ome new impre&s;&s;ion of af|fection
or di&s;gu&s;t, e&s;teem or contempt, approbation
or blame.</P>
<P>HENCE the great difference between a mi&s;take of
<HI>fact</HI> and one of <HI>right;</HI> and hence the rea&s;on, why the
one is commonly criminal and not the other. When
OEDIPUS killed LAIUS, he was ignorant of the rela|tion,
and from circum&s;tances, innocent and involun|tary,
formed erroneous opinions concerning the ac|tion
which he committed. But then NERO killed
AGRIPPINA, all the relations between him&s;elf and
the per&s;on, and all the circum&s;tances of the fact were
antecedently known to him: But the motive of re|venge,
or fear or intere&s;t, prevailed in his &s;avage
heart over the &s;entiments of duty and humanity. And
when we expre&s;s that dete&s;tation again&s;t him, to
which he, him&s;elf, in a little time, became in&s;en&s;ible;
'tis not, that we &s;ee any relations, of which he was
ignorant, but that, from the rectitude of our di&s;po&s;i|tion,
we feel &s;entiments, again&s;t which he was har|dened,
from flattery and a long per&s;everance in the
mo&s;t enormous crimes. In the&s;e &s;entiments, then,
not a di&s;covery of relations of any kind, do all mo|ral
determinations con&s;i&s;t. Before we can pretend to
form any deci&s;ion of this kind, every thing mu&s;t be
known and a&s;certained on the &s;ide of the object or
<PB N="202" REF="200">
action. Nothing remains but to feel, on our part,
&s;ome &s;entiment of blame or approbation; whence
we pronounce the action criminal or virtuous.</P>
<P>III. THIS doctrine will become &s;till more evident,
if we compare moral beauty with natural, to which,
in many particulars, it bears &s;o near a re&s;emblance.
'Tis on the proportion, relation, and po&s;ition of parts,
that all natural beauty depends; but it would be ab|&s;urd
thence to infer, that the perception of beauty,
like that of truth in geometrical problems, con&s;i&s;ts
wholly in the perception of relations, and was per|formed
entirely by the under&s;tanding or intellectual
faculties. In all the &s;ciences, our mind, from the
known relations, inve&s;tigates the unknown: But in
all deci&s;ions of ta&s;te or external beauty, the whole re|lations
are before hand obvious to the eye; and we
thence proceed to feel a &s;entiment of complacency or
di&s;gu&s;t, according to the nature of the object, and
di&s;po&s;ition of our organs.</P>
<P>EUCLID has fully explained all the qualities of the
circle; but has not, in any propo&s;ition, &s;aid a word
of its beauty. The rea&s;on is evident. The beauty
is not a quality of the circle. It lies not in any
part of the line, who&s;e parts are equally di&s;tant from
a common center. It is only the effect, which that
figure operates upon the mind, who&s;e peculiar fabric
or &s;tructure renders it &s;u&s;ceptible of &s;uch &s;entiments.
<PB N="203" REF="201">
In vain would you look for it in the circle, or &s;eek
it, either by your &s;en&s;es or by mathematical rea&s;on|ings,
in all the properties of that figure.</P>
<P>ATTEND to PALLADIO and PERRAULT, while
they explain all the parts and proportions of a pillar:
They talk of the cornice and freeze and ba&s;e and en|tablature
and &s;haft and architrave; and give the de|&s;cription
and po&s;ition of each of the&s;e members. But
&s;hould you a&s;k the de&s;cription and po&s;ition of its
beauty, they would readily reply, that the beauty
is not in any of the parts or members of a pillar, but
re&s;ults from the whole, when that complicated figure
is pre&s;ented to an intelligent mind, &s;u&s;ceptible of tho&s;e
finer &s;en&s;ations. 'Till &s;uch a &s;pectator appear, there
is nothing but a figure of &s;uch particular dimen&s;ions
and proportions: From his &s;entiments alone ari&s;e its
elegance and beauty.</P>
<P>AGAIN; attend to CICERO, while he paints the
crimes of a VERRES or a CATILINE; you mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
that the moral turpitude re&s;ults, in the
&s;ame manner, from the contemplation of the whole,
when pre&s;ented to a being, who&s;e organs have &s;uch
a particular &s;tructure and formation. The orator may
paint rage, in&s;olence, barbarity on the one &s;ide:
Meekne&s;s, &s;uffarence, &s;orrow, innocence on the other:
But if you feel no indignation or compa&s;&s;ion ari&s;e in
you from this complication of circum&s;tances, you
<PB N="204" REF="202">
would in vain a&s;k him, in what con&s;i&s;ts the crime or
villainy, which he &s;o vehemently exclaims again&s;t:
At what time, or on what &s;ubject it fir&s;t began to ex|i&s;t:
And what has a few months afterwards become
of it, when every di&s;po&s;ition and thought of all the
actors is totally altered, or annihilated. No &s;atisfac|tory
an&s;wer can be given to any of the&s;e que&s;tions,
upon the ab&s;tract hypothe&s;is of morals; and we mu&s;t
at la&s;t acknowledge, that the crime or immorality is
no particular fact or relation, which can be the object
of the under&s;tanding: But ari&s;es entirely from the
&s;entiment of di&s;approbation, which, by the &s;tructure
of human nature, we unavoidably feel on the appre|hen&s;ion
of barbarity or treachery.</P>
<P>IV. INANIMATE objects may bear to each other
all the &s;ame relations, which we ob&s;erve in moral
agents; tho' the former can never be the object of
love or hatred, nor are con&s;equently &s;u&s;ceptible of
merit or iniquity. A young tree, which over-tops
and de&s;troys its parent, &s;tands in all the &s;ame relations
with NERO, when he murdered AGRIPPINA; and if
morality con&s;i&s;ted in any ab&s;tract relations, would,
no doubt, be equally criminal.</P>
<P>V. IT appears evident, that the ultimate ends of
human actions can never, in any ca&s;e, be accounted
<PB N="205" REF="203">
for by <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> but recommend them&s;elves entirely to
the &s;entiments and affections of mankind, without
any dependance on the intellectual faculties. A&s;k a
man, <HI>why he u&s;es exerci&s;e;</HI> he will an&s;wer, <HI>becau&s;e he
de&s;ires to keep his health.</HI> If you then enquire, <HI>why
he de&s;ires health,</HI> he will readily reply, <HI>becau&s;e &s;ikne&s;s
is painful.</HI> If you pu&s;h your enquiries farther, and
de&s;ire a rea&s;on, <HI>why he hates pain,</HI> 'tis impo&s;&s;ible he
can ever give any. This is an ultimate end, and is
never referred to any other object.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, to your &s;econd que&s;tion, <HI>why he de&s;ires
health,</HI> he may al&s;o reply, that <HI>'tis requi&s;ite for the exer|ci&s;e
of his calling.</HI> If you a&s;k, <HI>why he is anxious on that
head,</HI> he will an&s;wer, <HI>becau&s;e he de&s;ires to get money.</HI>
If you demand <HI>Why? It is the in&s;trument of plea&s;ure,</HI>
&s;ays he. And beyond this it is an ab&s;urdity to a&s;k
for a rea&s;on. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible there can be a progre&s;s
<HI>in infinitum;</HI> and that one thing can always be a rea|&s;on,
why another is de&s;ired. Something mu&s;t be de|&s;irable
on its own account, and becau&s;e of its imme|diate
accord or agreement with human &s;entiment and
affection.</P>
<P>NOW as virtue is an end, and is de&s;irable on its
own account, without &s;ee or reward, merely for the
immediate &s;atisfaction which it conveys; 'tis requi&s;ite
<PB N="206" REF="204">
that there &s;hould be &s;ome &s;entiment, which it touches;
&s;ome internal ta&s;te or feeling, or whatever you plea&s;e
to call it, which di&s;tingui&s;hes moral good and evil,
and which embraces the one and rejects the other.</P>
<P>THUS the di&s;tinct boundaries and offices of <HI>rea&s;on</HI>
and of <HI>ta&s;te</HI> are ea&s;ily a&s;certained. The former conveys
the knowledge of truth and fal&s;hood: The latter gives
the &s;entiment of beauty and deformity, vice and virtue.
The one di&s;covers objects, as they really &s;tand in na|ture,
without addition or diminution: The other has a
productive faculty, and gilding or &s;taining all natural
objects with the colours, borrowed from internal &s;en|timent,
rai&s;es, in a manner, a new creation. Rea&s;on,
being cool and di&s;engaged, is no motive to action,
and directs only the impul&s;e received from appetite
or inclination, by &s;howing us the means of obtaining
happine&s;s or avoiding mi&s;ery: Ta&s;te, as it gives plea|&s;ure
or pain, and thereby con&s;titutes happine&s;s or mi|&s;ery,
becomes a motive to action, and is the fir&s;t
&s;pring or impul&s;e to de&s;ire and volition. From cir|cum&s;tances
and relations, known or &s;uppo&s;ed, the
former leads us to the di&s;covery of the concealed and
unknown: After all circum&s;tances and relations are
laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the
whole a new &s;entiment of blame or approbation.
The &s;tandard of the one, being founded on the na|ture
<PB N="207" REF="205">
of things, is eternal and inflexible, even by the
will of the &s;upreme Being: The &s;tandard of the
other, ari&s;ing from the internal frame and con&s;titution
of animals, is ultimately derived from that &s;upreme
will, which be&s;towed each being its peculiar nature,
and arranged the &s;everal cla&s;&s;es and orders of ex|i&s;tence.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SOME FARTHER CONSIDERATIONS with regard to
JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of this appendix is to give &s;ome
more particular explication of the origin and
and nature of ju&s;tice, and to mark &s;ome differences
between it and the other virtues.</P>
<P>THE &s;ocial virtues of humanity and benevolence
exert their influence immediately, by a direct ten|dency
or in&s;tinct, which keeps chiefly in view the
&s;imple object, that moves the affections, and com|prehends
not any &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem, nor the con&s;e|quences
re&s;ulting from the concurrence, imitation,
or example of others. A parent &s;lies to the relief of
his child; tran&s;ported by the natural &s;ympathy,
which actuates him, and which affords no lei&s;ure to
reflect on the &s;entiments or conduct of the re&s;t of
mankind in like circum&s;tances. A generous man
embraces cheerfully an opportunity of &s;erving his
<PB N="210" REF="207">
friend; becau&s;e he then feels him&s;elf under the domi|nion
of the beneficent affections, nor is he concerned
whether any other per&s;on in the univer&s;e was ever be|fore
actuated by &s;uch noble motives, or will ever af|terwards
prove their influence. In all the&s;e ca&s;es,
the &s;ocial pa&s;&s;ions have in view a &s;ingle individual
object, and pur&s;ue alone the &s;afety or happine&s;s of the
per&s;on, loved and e&s;teemed. With this, they are
&s;atisfied: In this, they acquie&s;ce. And as the good
re&s;ulting from their benign influence, is in it&s;elf
compleat and entire, it al&s;o excites the moral &s;enti|ment
of approbation, without any reflection on far|ther
con&s;equences or more enlarged views of the
concurrence or imitation of the other members of
&s;ociety. On the contrary, were the generous friend
or di&s;intere&s;ted patriot to &s;tand alone in the practice
of beneficence; this would rather inhance his value
in our eyes, and join the prai&s;e of rarity and novelty
to his other more exalted merits.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is not the &s;ame with the &s;ocial virtues of
ju&s;tice and fidelity. They are highly u&s;eful, or in|deed
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of man|kind:
But the benefit, re&s;ulting from them, is not
the con&s;equence of every individual &s;ingle $act; but
ari&s;es from the whole &s;cheme or &s;y&s;tem, concurred in
by the whole, or the greate&s;t part of the &s;ociety.
General peace and order are the attendants of ju&s;tice
or a general ab&s;tinence from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of other:
<PB N="211" REF="208">
But a particular regard to the particular right of one in|dividual
citizen may frequently, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, be
productive of pernicious con&s;equences. The re&s;ult of
the &s;everal acts is here often directly oppo&s;ite to that of
the whole &s;y&s;tem of actions; and the former may be ex|tremely
hurtful, while the latter is, to the highe&s;t degree,
advantageous. Riches, inherited from a parent, are, in
a bad man's hand, the in&s;truments of mi&s;chief. The
right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion may, in one in&s;tance, be hurtful.
Its benefit ari&s;es only from the ob&s;ervance of the ge|neral
rule; and 'tis &s;ufficient, if compen&s;ation be
thereby made for all the ills and inconveniencies,
which flow from particular characters and &s;ituations.</P>
<P>CYRUS, young and unexperienced, con&s;idered only
the individual ca&s;e before him, and reflected on its
limited fitne&s;s and convenience, when he a&s;&s;igned the
long coat to the tall boy, and the &s;hort coat to the
other of &s;maller &s;ize. His governor in&s;tructed him
better; while he pointed out more enlarged views
and con&s;equences, and informed his pupil of the ge|neral,
inflexible rules, requi&s;ite to &s;upport general
peace and order in &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THE happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of mankind, ari&s;ing
from the &s;ocial virtue of benevolence and its &s;ub|divi&s;ions,
may be compared to a wall, built by many
hands; which &s;till ri&s;es by each &s;tone, that is heaped
upon it, and receives proportional encrea&s;e to the
<PB N="212" REF="209">
diligence and care of each workman. The &s;ame
happine&s;s, rai&s;ed by the &s;ocial virtue of ju&s;tice and
its &s;ubdivi&s;ions, may be compared to the building of
a vault, where each individual &s;tone would, of it&s;elf
fall to the ground; nor does the whole fabric &s;upport
it&s;elf, but by the mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance and combination
of its corre&s;ponding parts.</P>
<P>ALL the laws of nature, which regulate property,
as well as all civil laws, are general, and regard
alone &s;ome e&s;&s;ential circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, with|out
taking into con&s;ideration the characters, &s;itua|tions
and connexions of the per&s;on concerned, or any
particular con&s;equences, which may re&s;ult from the
determination of the&s;e laws, in every particular ca&s;e
which offers. They deprive, without &s;cruple, a be|neficent
man of all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, if acquired by
mi&s;take, without a good title; in order to be&s;tow them
on a &s;elfi&s;h mi&s;er, who has already heaped up im|men&s;e
&s;tores of &s;uperfluous riches. Public utility re|quires,
that property &s;hould be regulated by general
inflexible rules; and tho' &s;uch rules are adopted as be&s;t
&s;erve the &s;ame end of public utility, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible

beneficial con&s;equences re&s;ult from every individual

nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of civil &s;ociety, and if the
ballance of good, in the main, does thereby prepon|derate
much above that of evil. Even the general
<PB N="213" REF="210">

cannot exclude all evil or inconvenience, in
every particular operation.</P>
<P>IT has been a&s;&s;erted by &s;ome, that ju&s;tice ari&s;es
from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and proceeds
from the voluntary choice, con&s;ent, or combination
of mankind. If by <HI>convention</HI> be here meant a <HI>pro|mi&s;e</HI>
(which is the mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;en&s;e of the word) no|thing
can be more ab&s;urd, than this po&s;ition. The
ob&s;ervance of promi&s;es is it&s;elf one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
parts of ju&s;tice; and we are not &s;urely bound
to keep our word, becau&s;e we have given our word
to keep it. But if by convention be meant a &s;en&s;e
of common intere&s;t; which &s;en&s;e each man feels in
his own brea&s;t, which he ob&s;erves in his fellows, and
which carries him, in concurrence with others, into
a general plan or &s;y&s;tem of actions, which tends to
public utility; it mu&s;t be owned, that, in this &s;en&s;e,
ju&s;tice ari&s;es from human conventions. For if it be
allowed (what is, indeed, evident) that the particular
con&s;equences of a particular act of ju&s;tice may be
hurtful to the public as well as to individuals; it
follows, that every man, in embracing that virtue,
mu&s;t have an eye to the whole plan or &s;y&s;tem, and
mu&s;t expect the concurrence of his fellows in the
&s;ame conduct and behaviour. Did all his views ter|minate
in the particular con&s;equences of each parti|cular
act of his own, his benevolence and humanity,
<PB N="214" REF="211">
as well as his &s;elf-love, might often pre&s;cribe to him
mea&s;ures of conduct very different from tho&s;e, which
are agreeable to the &s;trict rules of right and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>THUS two men pull the oars of a boat, by com|mon
convention, for common intere&s;t, without any
promi&s;e or contract: Thus gold and &s;ilver are made
the mea&s;ures of exchange; thus &s;peech and words
and language are fixed, by human convention and
agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two or
more per&s;ons, if all perform their part; but what
lo&s;es all advantage, if only one perform, can ari&s;e
from no other principle. There would otherwi&s;e be

THE word, <HI>natural,</HI> is commonly taken in &s;o ma|ny

&s;eems to little purpo&s;e to di&s;pute, whether ju&s;tice be
natural or not. If &s;elf-love, if benevolence be natu|ral
to man; if rea&s;on and forethought be al&s;o natural;
then may the &s;ame epithet be applied to ju&s;tice, or|der,
fidelity, property, &s;ociety. Men's inclination,
their nece&s;&s;ities lead them to combine; their under|&s;tanding
and experience tell them, that this combi|nation
is impo&s;&s;ible, where each governs him&s;elf by
no rule, and pays no regard to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of
others: And from the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and reflections con|joined,
as &s;oon as we ob&s;erve like pa&s;&s;ions and re|flections
in others, the &s;entiment of ju&s;tice, thro' all

<P><PB N="216" REF="213">
AMONG all civilized nations, it has been the con|&s;tant
endeavour to remove every thing arbitrary and
partial from the deci&s;ion of property, and to fix the
&s;entence of judges by &s;uch general views and con&s;i|derations,
as may be equal to every member of the
&s;ociety. For be&s;ides, that nothing could be more
dangerous than to accu&s;tom the bench, even in the
&s;malle&s;t in&s;tance, to regard private friend&s;hip or en|mity;
'tis certain, that men, where they imagine,
that there was no other rea&s;on for the preference of
their adver&s;ary but per&s;onal favour, are apt to enter|tain
the &s;tronge&s;t ill will again&s;t the magi&s;trates and
judges. When natural rea&s;on, therefore, points out
no fixed view of public utility, by which a contro|ver&s;y
of property can be decide, po&s;itive laws are
often framed to &s;upply its place, and direct the pro|cedure
of all courts of judicature. Where the&s;e too
fail, as often happens, precedents are called for;
<PB N="217" REF="214">
and a former deci&s;ion, tho' given it&s;elf without any
&s;ufficient rea&s;on, ju&s;tly becomes a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for
a new deci&s;ion. If direct laws and precedents be
wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in
aid; and the controverted ca&s;e is ranged under them,
by analogical rea&s;onings and compari&s;ons, and &s;imi|litudes,
and$ corre&s;pondencies, which are often more
fanciful than real. In general, it may &s;afely be a&s;&s;ert|ed,
that juri&s;prudence is, in this re&s;pect, different
from all the &s;ciences; and that in many of its nicer
que&s;tions, there cannot properly be &s;aid to be truth
or fal&s;hood on either &s;ide. If one pleader brings the
ca&s;e under any former law or precedent, by a refined
analogy or compari&s;on; the oppo&s;ite pleader is not
at a lo&s;s to find an oppo&s;ite analogy or compari&s;on:
And the preference given by the judge is often
founded more on ta&s;te and imagination than on any
&s;olid argument. Public utility is the general view of
all courts of judicature; and this utility too requires
a &s;table rule in all controver&s;ies: But where &s;everal
rules, nearly equal and indifferent, pre&s;ent them|&s;elves,
'tis a very &s;light turn of thought, which fixes
the deci&s;ion in favour of either party<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>That there be a &s;eparation or di&s;tinction of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and that this &s;eparation be &s;teddy and con&s;tant; this is ab&s;olutely required by the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, and hence the origin of ju&s;|tice and property. What po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are a&s;&s;igned to particular per&s;ons; this is, generally &s;peaking, pretty indifferent; and is often determined by very frivolous views and con&s;iderations. We &s;hall mention a few particulars.</P>
<P>Were a &s;ociety formed among &s;everal independent members, the mo&s;t obvious rule, which could be agreed on, would be to annex property to <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and leave every one a right to what he at pre&s;ent enjoys. The relation of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which takes place between the per&s;on and the object, naturally draws on the relation of property.</P>
<P>For a like rea&s;on, occupation or fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion becomes the foundation of property.</P>
<P>Where a man be&s;tows labour and indu&s;try upon any object, which before belonged to no body; as in cutting down and &s;hap|ing a tree, in cultivating a field, &amp;c. the alterations, which he produces, cau&s;es a relation between him and the object, and na|turally engages us to annex it to him by the new relation of property. This cau&s;e here concurs with the public utility, which con&s;i&s;ts in the encouragement given to indu&s;try and labour.</P>
<P>Perhaps too, private humanity toward the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, concurs, in this in&s;tance, with the other motives, and engages us to leave with him what he has acquired by his &s;weat and labour; and what he has flattered him&s;elf in the con&s;tant enjoyment of. For tho' private humanity can, by no means, be the origin of ju&s;tice; &s;ince the latter virtue &s;o often contradicts the former; yet when the rule of &s;eparate and con&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;ion is once formed by the indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety, private huma|nity, and an aver&s;ion to the doing a hard&s;hip to another, may, in a particular in&s;tance, give ri&s;e to a particular rule of pro|perty.</P>
<P>I am much inclined to think, that the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion or inheritance much depends on tho&s;e connexions of the imagina|tion, and that the relation to a former proprietor begetting a re|lation to the object, is the cau&s;e why the property is transferred to a man after the death of his kin&s;man. 'Tis true; indu&s;try is more encouraged by the transference of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to children of near relations: But this con&s;ideration will only have place in a cultivated &s;ociety; whereas the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is regarded even among the greate&s;t Barbarians.</P>
<P>Acqui&s;ition of property by <HI>acce&s;&s;ion</HI> can be explained no way but by having recour&s;e to the relations and connexions of the imagination.</P>
<P>The property of rivers, by the laws of mo&s;t nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting &s;uch va&s;t rivers as the RHINE or the DANUBE, which &s;eem too large to follow as an acce&s;&s;ion the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even the&s;e rivers are con&s;idered as the property of that nation, thro' who&s;e do|minions they run; the idea of a nation being of a &s;uitable bulk to corre&s;pond with them, and bear them &s;uch a relation in the fancy.</P>
<P>The acce&s;&s;ions, which are made to land, bordering upon rivers, follow the land, &s;ay the civilians, provided it be made by what they call <HI>alluvion,</HI> that is, in&s;en&s;ibly and imperceptibly; which are circum&s;tances, that a&s;&s;i&s;t the imagination in the con|junction.</P>
<P>Where there is any con&s;iderable portion torn at once from one bank and added to another, it becomes not <HI>his</HI> property, who&s;e land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees and plants have &s;pread their roots into both. Before that, the thought does not &s;ufficiently join them.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, we mu&s;t every di&s;tingui&s;h between the nece&s;&s;ity of a &s;eparation and con&s;tancy in men's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the rules, which a&s;&s;ign particular objects to particular per&s;ons. The fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity is obvious, &s;trong, and invincible: The latter may depend on a public utility more light and frivolous, on the &s;entiment of private humanity and aver&s;ion to private hard&s;hip, on po&s;itive laws, on precedents, analogies and very fine connexions and turns of the imagination.</P></NOTE>.</P>

WE may ju&s;tly ob&s;erve, before we conclude this
&s;ubject, that, after the laws of ju&s;tice are fixed by

in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: I lay my account with the

di&s;appoint my expectations, and doubly di&s;plea&s;e me,
and offend every by&s;tander. 'Tis a public wrong,
<PB N="221" REF="218">
&s;o far as the rules of equity are violated: 'Tis a
private harm, &s;o far as an individual is injured. And

the regard to general good is much enforced by the
re&s;pect to particular. What injures the community,
without hurting any individual, is often more lightly
thought of. But where the greate&s;t public wrong is

<HEAD>A
DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend, PALAMEDES, who is as great a ram|bler
in his principles as in his per&s;on, and who
has run over, by &s;tudy and travel, almo&s;t every region
of the intellectual and material world, &s;urprized me
lately with an account of a nation, with whom, he
told me, he had pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable part of his life,
and whom he found, in the main, a people extremely
civilized and intelligent.</P>
<P>THERE is a &s;tate, &s;aid he, in the world, called
FOURLI, no matter for its longitude or latitude,
who&s;e ways of thinking, in many things, particularly
in morals, are diametrically oppo&s;ite to ours. When
I came among them, I found that I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to
double pains; fir&s;t to learn the meaning of the terms
in their language, and then to know the import of
tho&s;e terms, and the prai&s;e or blame attached to them.
After a word had been explained to me, and the cha|racter,
which it expre&s;&s;ed, had been de&s;cribed, I
concluded, that &s;uch an epithet mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
<PB N="224" REF="220">
the greate&s;t reproach in the world; and was extreme|ly
&s;urprized to find one in a public company, apply
it to a per&s;on, with whom he lived in the &s;tricte&s;t inti|macy
and friend&s;hip. <HI>You fancy,</HI> &s;aid I, one day, to
an acquaintance, <HI>that</HI> CHANGUIS <HI>is your mortal ene|my:
I love to extingui&s;h quarrels; and I mu&s;t, there|fore,
tell you, that I heard him talk of you in the mo&s;t
advantageous manner.</HI> But to my great a&s;toni&s;hment,
when I repeated CHANGUIS'S words, though I had
both remembered and under&s;tood them perfectly, I
found, that they were taken for the mo&s;t mortal af|front,
and that I had very innocently rendered the
breach between the&s;e per&s;ons altogether irreparable.</P>
<P>As it was my fortune to come among this people on
a very advantageous footing, I was immediately intro|duced
to the be&s;t company; and being de&s;ired to live
with ALCHEIC, I readily accepted his invitation; as
I found him univer&s;ally e&s;teemed for his per&s;onal
merit, and indeed regarded by every one in FOURLI,
as a perfect character.</P>
<P>ONE evening he invited me, as an amu&s;ement, to
bear him company in a &s;erenade, which he intended
to give GULRI, with whom, he told me, he was
extremely enamoured; and I &s;oon found his ta&s;te was
not &s;ingular: For we met many of his rivals, who had
come on the &s;ame errand. I very naturally concluded,
that this mi&s;tre&s;s of his mu&s;t be one of the fine&s;t women
<PB N="225" REF="221">
in town; and I readily felt a &s;ecret inclination to &s;ee
her, and be acquainted with her. But as the moon
began to ri&s;e, I was much &s;urprized to find, that we
were in the mid&s;t of the univer&s;ity, where GULKI
&s;tudied: And I was &s;omewhat a&s;hamed for having at|tended
my friend, on &s;uch an errand.</P>
<P>I was told afterwards, that ALCHEIC'S choice of
GULKI was very much approved of by all the good
company in town; and that it was expected, while
he gratified his own pa&s;&s;ion, he would perform to that
young man the &s;ame good office, which he had him|&s;elf
owed to ELCOUF. It &s;eems ALCHEIC had been
very hand&s;ome in his youth, had been courted by
many lovers; but had be&s;towed his favours chiefly on
the &s;age ELCOUF; to whom he was &s;uppo&s;ed to owe
in a great mea&s;ure, the a&s;toni&s;hing progre&s;s which he
had made in philo&s;ophy and virtue.</P>
<P>IT gave me &s;ome &s;urpize, that ALCHEIC'S wife
(who by-the-bye happened al&s;o to be his &s;i&s;ter)
was no ways &s;candalized at this &s;pecies of infidelity.</P>
<P>MUCH about the &s;ame time I di&s;covered (for it was
not attempted to be kept a &s;ecret from me or any body)
that ALCHEIC was a murderer and a parricide, and
had put to death an innocent per&s;on, the mo&s;t nearly
connected with him, and whom he was obliged to pro|tect
and defend by all the ties of nature and humanity.
<PB N="226" REF="222">
When I a&s;ked, with all the caution and deference ima|ginable,
what was his motive for this action; he re|plied
coolly, that he was not then &s;o much at his ea&s;e
as he is at pre&s;ent, and that he had acted, in that
particular, by the advice of all his friends.</P>
<P>HAVING heard ALCHEIC'S virtue &s;o extremely
celebrated, I pretended to join in the general voice of
acclamation, and only a&s;ked, by way of curio&s;ity, as
a &s;tranger, which of all his noble actions was mo&s;t
highly applauded; and I &s;oon found, that all &s;enti|ments
were united in giving the preference to the a&s;|&s;a&s;&s;ination
of USBEK. This USBEK had been to the
la&s;t moment ALCHEIC'S intimate friend, had laid
many high obligations upon him, had even &s;aved his
life on a certain occa&s;ion, and had, by his will, which
was found after and murder, made him heir to a con|&s;iderable
part of his fortune. ALCHEIC, it &s;eems,
con&s;pired with about twenty or thirty more, mo&s;t of
them al&s;o USBEK'S friends; and falling all together,
on that unhappy man, when he was not aware, they
had torne him with a hundred wounds; and given
him that reward for all his pa&s;t favours and obliga|tions.
USBEK, &s;aid the general voice of the people,
had many great and good qualities: His very vices
were &s;hining, magnificent, and generous: But this
action of ALCHEIC &s;ets him far above USBEK in the
eyes of all judges of merit; and is one of the noble&s;t
that every perhaps the &s;un &s;hone upon.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="223">
ANOTHER part of ALCHEIC'S conduct, which I
al&s;o found highly applauded, was his behaviour to|wards
CALISH, with whom he was joined in a project
or undertaking of &s;ome importance. CALISH, being
a pa&s;&s;ionate man, gave ALCHEIC, one day, a &s;ound
drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited the
return of CALISH'S good humour, kept &s;till a fair
corre&s;pondence with him; and by that means brought
the affair, in which they were joined, to a happy i&s;&s;ue,
and gained him&s;elf immortal honour by his remark|able
temper and moderation.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately received a letter from a corre&s;pondent
in FOURLI, by which I learn, that &s;ince my depar|ture,
ALCHEIC, falling into a bad &s;tate of health,
has fairly hanged him&s;elf; and has died univer&s;ally re|gretted
and applauded in that country. So virtuous
and noble a life, &s;ays each FOURLIAN, could not be
better crowned than by &s;o noble an end; and AL|CHEIC
has proved by this, as well as by all other ac|tions,
what was his con&s;tant principle during his life,
and what he boa&s;ted of near his la&s;t moments, that a
wi&s;e man is &s;carce inferior to the great god, VITZLI.
This is the name of the &s;upreme deity among the
FOURLIANS.</P>
<P>THE notions of this people, continued PALAMEDES,
are as extraordinary with regard to good-manners and
&s;ociablene&s;s, as with regard to morals. My friend
<PB N="228" REF="224">
ALCHEIC formed once a party for my entertainment,
compo&s;ed of all the prime wits and philo&s;ophers of
FOURLI; and each of us brought his me&s;s along with
him to the place, where we a&s;&s;embled. I ob&s;erved
one of them to be wor&s;e provided than the re&s;t, and
offered him a &s;hare of my me&s;s, which happened to be
a roa&s;ted pullet: And I could not but remark, that
he, and all the re&s;t of the company &s;miled at my &s;im|plicity.
I was told, that ALCHEIC had once &s;o much
intere&s;t with his club as to prevail with them to eat
in common, and that he had made u&s;e of an artifice
to that purpo&s;e. He per&s;uaded tho&s;e, whom he ob|&s;erved
to be <HI>wor&s;t</HI> provided, to offer their me&s;s to the
company; after which, the others, who had brought
more delicate fare, were a&s;hamed not to make the
&s;ame offer. This is regarded as &s;o extraordinary an
event, that it has &s;ince, as I learn, been recorded in
the hi&s;tory of ALCHEIC'S life, compo&s;ed by one of the
greate&s;t geniu&s;es of FOURLI.</P>
<P>PRAY, &s;ays I, PALAMEDES, when you was at
FOURLI, did you al&s;o learn the art of turning your
friends into ridicule, by telling them &s;trange &s;tories,
and then laughing at them, if they believed you. I
a&s;&s;ure you, replied he, had I been di&s;po&s;ed to learn
&s;uch a le&s;&s;on, there was no place in the world more
proper. My friend, &s;o often mentioned, did nothing,
from morning to night, but &s;$eer, and banter, and
rally; and you could &s;carce ever di&s;tingui&s;h, whether
<PB N="229" REF="225">
he was in je&s;t or earne&s;t. But you think then, that
my &s;tory is improbable: and that I have u&s;ed, or ra|ther
abu&s;ed the privilege of a traveller. To be &s;ure,
&s;ays I, you was but in je&s;t. Such barbarous and &s;a|vage
manners are not only incompatible with a civi|lized,
intelligent people, &s;uch as you &s;aid the&s;e were&punc;
but are &s;care compatible with human nature. They
exceed all we ever red of, among the MINGRELIANS,

<P>HAVE a care, cried he, have a care! You are not
aware that you are &s;peaking bla&s;phemy, and are abu&s;|ing
your favourites, the GREEKS, e&s;pecially the
ATHENIANS, whom I have couched, all along, under
the&s;e bizarre names I employed. If you con&s;ider
aright, there is not one &s;troke of the foregoing cha|racter,
which might not be found in the man of high|e&s;t
merit at ATHENS, without dimini&s;hing in the lea&s;t,
from the brightne&s;s of his character. The GREEK
love, their marriages<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The laws of ATHENS allowed a man to marry his &s;i&s;ter by the father. SOLON'S law forbid paedera&s;ty to &s;laves, as being an act of too great dignity for &s;uch mean per&s;ons.</NOTE>, and the expo&s;ing of their chil|dren
cannot but &s;trike you immediately. The death
of USBEK is an exact counter-part to that of CAESAR.</P>

I DID not, replied he; le&s;t you &s;hould di&s;cover the
parallel I aimed at. But even adding this circum|&s;tance,
we &s;hould make no &s;cruple, according to our
&s;entiments of morals, to denominate BRUTUS, and
CASSIUS, ungrateful traitors and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins: Though
you know, that they are, perhaps, the highe&s;t cha|racters
of all antiquity; and the ATHENIANS erected
&s;tatues to them; which they placed near tho&s;e of
HARMODIUS and ARISTOGITON, their own deliver|ers.
And if you think this circum&s;tance, which you
mention, &s;o material to ab&s;olve the&s;e patriots, I &s;hall
compen&s;ate it by another, not mentioned, which will
equally aggravate their crime. A few days before the
execution of their fatal purpo&s;e, they all &s;wore fealty
to CAESAR; and prote&s;ting to hold his per&s;on ever
&s;acred, they touched the altar with tho&s;e hands,
which they had already armed for his de&s;truction<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">APPIAN. Bell. Civ. lib. 3. SUETONIUS in vita CAESARIS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and ap|plauded

YOU are too good a &s;cholar not to di&s;cover the iro|nical
SOCRATES and his ATHENIAN club in my la&s;t

copied from XENOPHON, with a variation only
of the names<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mem. Soc. lib. 3. &s;ub fine.</NOTE>. And I think I have fairly made it ap|pear,

an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, an ungrateful, perjured traitor, and
&s;omething el&s;e too abminable to be named; not to

You &s;eem to take plea&s;ure in this topic; and

which they are not &s;urpa&s;&s;ed by the moderns. Geo|metry,

<P>THERE
are no manners &s;o innocent or rea&s;onable,
which may not be rendered odious or ridiculous, if
mea&s;ured by a &s;tandard, unknown to the per&s;ons;
e&s;pecially, if you employ a little art or eloquence, in
aggravating &s;ome circum&s;tances, and extenuating

All the&s;e artifices may ea&s;ily be retorted on you.
Could I inform the ATHENIANS, for in&s;tance, that
there was a nation, in which adultery, both active and
pa&s;&s;ive, &s;o to &s;peak, was in the highe&s;t vogue and
e&s;teem: In which every man of education cho&s;e for
his mi&s;tre&s;s a married woman, the wife, perhaps, of
his friend and companion; and valued him&s;elf upon
the&s;e infamous conque&s;ts, as much as if he had been
<PB N="233" REF="229">
&s;everal times a conqueror in boxing or wre&s;tling at the
<HI>Olympic</HI> games: In which every man, al&s;o, took a
pride in his tamene&s;s and facility with regard to his
own wife, and was glad to make friends or gain in|tere&s;t
by allowing her to pro&s;titute her charms; and
even, without any &s;uch motive, give her full liberty
and indulgence: I a&s;k, what &s;entiments the ATHE|NIANS
would entertain of &s;uch a people; they who
never mentioned the crime of adultery but in conjunc|tion
with robbery and poi&s;oning? Which would they
admire mo&s;t, the villainy or the meanne&s;s of &s;uch a
conduct?</P>
<P>SHOULD I add, that the &s;ame people were as
proud of their &s;lavery and dependance as the ATHE|NIANS
of their liberty; and though a man among
them were oppre&s;&s;ed, di&s;graced, impoveri&s;hed, in&s;ulted,
or impri&s;oned by the tyrant, he would &s;till regard it
as the highe&s;t merit to love, &s;erve, and obey him;
and even to die for his &s;malle&s;t glory or &s;atisfaction:
The&s;e noble GREEKS would probably a&s;k me, whe|ther
I &s;poke of a human &s;ociety, or of &s;ome inferior,
&s;ervile &s;pecies.</P>
<P>IT was then I might inform my ATHENIAN audi|ence,
that the&s;e people, however, wanted not &s;pirit
and bravery. If a man, &s;ays I, though their intimate
friend, &s;hould throw out, in a private company, a
raillery again&s;t them, nearly approaching any of tho&s;e,
<PB N="234" REF="230">
with which your generals and demagogues every day
regale each other, in the face of the whole city, they
never can forgive him; but in order to revenge them|&s;elves,
they oblige him immediately to run them thro'
the body, or be him&s;elf murdered. And if a man,
who is an ab&s;olute &s;tranger to them, &s;hould de&s;ire
them, at the peril of their own life, to cut the throat
of their bo&s;om-companion, they immediately obey,
and think them&s;elves highly obliged and honoured by
the commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are their maxims of honour:
This is their favourite morality.</P>
<P>BUT though &s;o ready to draw their &s;word again&s;t
their friends and countrymen; no di&s;grace, no infamy,
no pain, no poverty will ever engage the&s;e people to
turn the point of it again&s;t their own brea&s;t. A man
of rank would row in the gallies, would beg his
bread, would langui&s;h in pri&s;on, would &s;uffer any
tortures; and &s;till pre&s;erve his wretched life. Rather
than e&s;cape his enemies by a generous contempt of
death, he would infamou&s;ly receive the &s;ame death
from his enemies, aggravated by their triumphant in|&s;ults,
and by the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>'TIS very u&s;ual too, continued I, among this peo|ple
to erect jails, where every art of plaguing and
tormenting the unhappy pri&s;oners is carefully &s;tudied
and practi&s;ed: And in the&s;e jails it is u&s;ual for a parent
voluntarily to &s;hut up &s;everal of his children; in or|der,
<PB N="235" REF="231">
that another child, whom he owns to have no
greater or rather le&s;s merit than the re&s;t, may enjoy
his whole fortune, and wallow in every kind of vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s
and plea&s;ure. Nothing &s;o virtuous in
their opinion as this barbarous partiality.</P>
<P>BUT what is more &s;ingular in this whim|&s;ical
nation, &s;ay I to the ATHENIANS, is, that
a frolic of yours during the SATURNALIA<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">THE GREEKS kept the fea&s;t of SATURN or CHRONUS, as well as the ROMANS. See LUCIAN. Epi&s;t. SATURN.</NOTE>,
when the &s;l$ves are &s;erved by their ma&s;ters, is
&s;eriou&s;ly continued by them through the whole
year, and through the whole cour&s;e of their
lives; accompanied too with &s;ome circum&s;tances,
which &s;till farther augment the ab&s;urdity and ridicule.
Your &s;port only elevates for a few days tho&s;e whom
fortune has thrown down, and whom &s;he too, in &s;port,
may really elevate for ever above you: But this na|tion
gravely exalts tho&s;e, whom nature has &s;ubjected
to them, and who&s;e inferiority and infirmities are ab|&s;olutely
incurable. The women, though without vir|tue,
are their ma&s;ters and &s;overeigns: The&s;e they re|verence,
prai&s;e and magnify: To the&s;e, they pay the
highe&s;t deference and re&s;pect: And in all places and
at all times, the &s;ueriority of the females is readily
acknowledged and &s;ubmitted to by every one, who
has the lea&s;t preten&s;ions to education and politene&s;s.
<PB N="236" REF="232">
Scarce any crime would be &s;o univer&s;ally dete&s;ted as
an infraction of this rule.</P>
<P>YOU need go no further, replied PALAMEDES; I
can ea&s;ily conjecture the people whom you aim at.
The &s;trokes, with which you have painted them, are
pretty ju&s;t; and yet you mu&s;t acknowledge, that
&s;carce any people are to be found, either in antient or
modern times, who&s;e national character is, upon the
whole, le&s;s liable to exception. But I give you
thanks for helping me out with my argument. I had
no intention of exalting the moderns at the expence
of the antients. I only meant to repre&s;ent the uncer|tainty
of all the&s;e judgments concerning characters;
and to convince you, that fa&s;hion, vogue, cu&s;tom and
law, were the chief foundation of all moral deter|minations.
The ATHENIANS &s;urely, were a civi|lized,
intelligent people, if ever there was one; and
yet their man of merit might, in this age, be held in
horror and execration. The FRENCH are al&s;o, with|out
doubt, a very civilized, intelligent people; and
yet their man of merit might, with the ATHENIANS,
be an object of the highe&s;t contempt and ridicule,
and even hatred. And what renders the matter more
extraordinary: The&s;e two people are &s;uppo&s;ed to be
the mo&s;t &s;imilar in their national character of any in
antient and modern times; and while the ENGLISH
flatter them&s;elves that they re&s;emble the ROMANS,
their neighbours on the continent draw the parallel
<PB N="237" REF="233">
between them&s;elves and tho&s;e polite GREEKS. What
wide difference, therefore, in the &s;entiments of mo|rals,
mu&s;t be found between civilized nations and
Barbarians, or between nations who&s;e characters have
little in common? How &s;hall we pretend to fix a &s;tan|dard
for judgments of this nature?</P>
<P>BY tracing matters, replied I, a little higher, and
examining the fir&s;t principles, which each national e&s;ta|bli&s;hes,
of blame or cen&s;ure. The RHINE flows
north, the RHONE &s;outh; yet both &s;pring from the
<HI>&s;ame</HI> mountain, and are al&s;o actuated, in their oppo|&s;ite
directions, by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> principle of gravity. The
different inclinations of the ground, on which they
run, cau&s;e all the difference of their cour&s;es.</P>
<P>IN how many circum&s;tances would an ATHENIAN
and a FRENCH man of merit certainly re&s;emble each
other? Good &s;en&s;e, knowledge, wit, eloquence, hu|manity,
fidelity, truth, ju&s;tice, courage, temperance,
con&s;tancy, dignity of mind. The&s;e you have all
omitted; in order to in&s;i&s;t only on the points, in
which they may, by accident, differ. Very well: I
am willing to comply with you; and &s;hall endeavour
to account for the&s;e differences from the mo&s;t univer|&s;al,
e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of morals.</P>
<P>THE GREEK loves, I care not to examine more par|ticularly.
I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that, however blame|able,
<PB N="238" REF="234">
they aro&s;e from a very innocent cau&s;e, the fre|quency
of the gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es among that people:
and were recommended, though ab&s;urdly, as the
&s;ource of friend&s;hip, &s;ympathy, mutual attachment,
and fidelity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">PLAT. &s;ymp. p. 182. Ex edit. SE$$.</NOTE>; qualities e&s;teemed in all nations and all
ages.</P>
<P>THE marriage of half-brothers and &s;i&s;ters &s;eems no
great difficulty. Love between the nearer relations is
contrary to rea&s;on and public utility; but the preci&s;e
point, where we are to &s;top, can &s;carcely be deter|mined
by natural rea&s;on; and is therefore a very pro|per
&s;ubject of municipal law or cu&s;tom. If the ATHE|NIANS
went a little too far on the one &s;ide, the canon
law has &s;urely pu&s;hed matters a great way into the
other extreme<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry, Sect. IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD you a&s;ked a parent at ATHENS, why he be|reaved
his child of that life, which he had &s;o lately
given it. 'Tis becau&s;e I love it, he would reply;
and regard the poverty which it mu&s;t inherit from
me, as a greater evil than a death, which it is not
capable of dreading, feeling, or re&s;enting<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLUT. de amore prolis, &s;ub fine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="235">
HOW is public liberty, the mo&s;t valuable of all ble&s;|&s;ings,
to be recovered from the hands of an u&s;urper
or tyrant, if his power &s;hields him from public rebel|lion,
and our &s;cruples from private vengeance? That
his crime is capital by law, you acknowledge: And
mu&s;t the highe&s;t aggravation of his crime, the putting
him&s;elf above law, form his full &s;ecurity? You can
reply nothing, but by &s;howing the great inconvenien|cies
of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination; which could any one have proved
clearly to the antients, he had reformed their &s;enti|ments
in this particular.</P>
<P>AGAIN, to ca&s;t your eye on the picture which I
have drawn of modern manners; there is almo&s;t as
great difficulty, I acknowledge, to ju&s;tify FRENCH as
GREEK gallantry; except only, that the former is
much more natural and agreeable than the latter. But
our neighbours, it &s;eems, have re&s;olved to &s;acrifice
&s;ome of the dome&s;tic to the &s;ociable plea&s;ures; and to
prefer ea&s;e, freedom and an open commerce to a
&s;trict fidelity and con&s;tancy. The&s;e ends are both
good, and are &s;omewhat difficult to reconcile; nor
need we be &s;urprized, if the cu&s;toms of nations incline
too much, &s;ometimes to the one &s;ide, &s;ometimes to the
other.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t inviolable attachment to the laws of our
country is every-where acknowledged a capital virtue;
and where the people are not &s;o happy, as to have
<PB N="240" REF="236">
any other legi&s;lature but a &s;ingle per&s;on, the &s;tricte&s;t
loyalty is, in that ca&s;e, the true&s;t patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>NOTHING &s;urely can be more ab&s;urd and barbarous
than the practice of duelling; but tho&s;e, who ju&s;tify
it, &s;ay, that it begets civility and good manners. And
a dueli&s;t, you may ob&s;erve, always values him&s;elf upon
his courage, his &s;en&s;e of honour, his fidelity and
friend&s;hip; qualities, which are here indeed very
oddly directed, but which have been e&s;teemed univer|&s;ally,
&s;ince the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>HAVE the gods forbid &s;elf-murder? An ATHE|NIAN
allows, that it ought to be forborn. Has the
Deity permitted it? A FRENCHMAN allows, that
death is pre&s;erable to pain and infamy.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee then, continued I, that the principles,
upon which men rea&s;on in morals are always the &s;ame;
though the conclu&s;ions which they draw are often very
different. That they all rea&s;on aright with regard to
this &s;ubject, more than with regard to any other, it is
not incumbent on any morali&s;t to &s;how. 'Tis &s;uffici|ent,
that the original principles of cen&s;ure or blame
are uniform, and that erroneous conclu&s;ions can be
corrected by &s;ounder rea&s;oning and larger experience.
Though many ages have elap&s;ed &s;ince the fall of
GREECE and ROME; though many changes have ar|rived
in religion, language, laws, and cu&s;toms; none
<PB N="241" REF="237">
of the&s;e revolutions has ever produced any con&s;ider|able
innovation in the primary &s;entiments of morals,
more than in tho&s;e of external beauty. Some minute
differences, perhaps, may be ob&s;erved in both. HO|RACE

in morals may be reduced to this one general founda|tion,
and may be accounted for by the different views,
which people take of the&s;e circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES men differ in their judgment about
the u&s;efulne&s;s of any habit or action: Sometimes al&s;o
<PB N="242" REF="238">
the peculiar circum&s;tances of things render one moral
quality more u&s;eful than others, and give it a pecu|liar
preference.</P>
<P>'TIS not &s;urpri&s;ing, that, during a period of war,
and di&s;order, the military virtues &s;hould be more cele|brated
than the pacific, and attract more the admira|tion
and attention of mankind. &startq;How u&s;ual is it.&endq;
&s;ays TULLY<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tu&s;c. Quae&s;t. lib. 2.</NOTE>, &startq;to find CIMBRIANS, CELTIBE|RIANS,

when he attacks them violently with &s;words
and falchions!&endq; So oppo&s;ite is even the &s;ame vir|tue
of courage among warlike or peaceful nations!
And indeed, we may ob&s;erve, that as the difference
between war and peace is the greate&s;t which ari&s;es a|mong
nations and public &s;ocieties, it produces al&s;o the
greate&s;t variations in moral &s;entiment, and diver&s;ifies

<P>SOMETIMES too, magnanimity, greatne&s;s of mind,

&s;uit better the circum&s;tances of one age than tho&s;e of
<PB N="243" REF="239">
another, and have a more kindly influence, both on
public affairs, and on a man's own &s;afety and advance|ment.
Our idea of merit, therefore, will al&s;o vary a
little with the&s;e variations; and LABEO, perhaps, be
cen&s;ured for the &s;ame qualities, which procured CATO
the highe&s;t approbation.</P>
<P>A DEGREE of luxury may be ruinous and perni|cious

<P>DIFFERENT cu&s;toms have al&s;o &s;ome influence as

re&s;erved in their commerce with the fair-&s;ex, and to
have impo&s;ed on them the &s;tricte&s;t laws of mode&s;ty and
decency. We have a &s;trong in&s;tance of this in an
oration of LYSIAS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Orat. 33.</NOTE>. A widow injured, ruined, un|done,
calls a meeting of a few of her neare&s;t friends
and relations; and though never before accu&s;tomed,
&s;ays the orator, to &s;peak in the pre&s;ence of men, the
di&s;tre&s;s of her circum&s;tances con&s;trained her to lay
the ca&s;e before them. The very opening her mouth
in &s;uch company required, it &s;eems, an apology.</P>
<P>WHEN DEMOSTHENES pro&s;ecuted his tutors, to
make them refund his patrimony, it became nece&s;&s;ary
for him, in the cour&s;e of the law-&s;uit, to prove that
the marriage of APHOBUS's &s;i&s;ter with ONETER was
entirely fraudulent, and that, notwith&s;tanding her
&s;ham marriage, &s;he had lived with her brother at
ATHENS for two years la&s;t pa&s;t, ever &s;ince her divorce
from her former hu&s;band. And tis remarkable, that
though the&s;e were people of the fir&s;t fortune and di|&s;tinction
<PB N="245" REF="241">
in the city, the orator could prove this fact
no way, but by calling for her female &s;laves to be put

who had &s;een her in her brother's hou&s;e during her

<P>WE may be a&s;&s;ured, that an extreme purity was
the con&s;equence of this re&s;erve. Accordingly we find,
that, except the fabulous &s;tories of an HELEN and
a CLYTEMNESTRA, there &s;carce is an in&s;tance of any
event in the GREEK hi&s;tory, which proceeded from the
intrigues of women. On the other hand, in modern
times, particularly in a neighbouring nation, the fe|males
enter into all tran&s;actions and all management
of church and &s;tate: And no man can expect &s;ucce&s;s,
who takes not care to obtain their good graces.
HARRY the third, by incurring the di&s;plea&s;ure of the

<P>'TIS needle&s;s to di&s;&s;emble: The con&s;equence of a

<P>NOR will the&s;e different cu&s;toms of nations affect
only the one &s;ex: Their idea of per&s;onal merit in the
males mu&s;t al&s;o be &s;omewhat different with regard, at
lea&s;t, to conver&s;ation, addre&s;s, and humour. The
one nation, where the men live much apart, will na|turally
more approve of prudence; the other, of
gaiety. With the one &s;implicity of manners will
be in the highe&s;t e&s;teem; with the other, politene&s;s.
The one will di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves by good-&s;en&s;e and
judgment; the other, by ta&s;te and delicacy. The
eloquence of the former will &s;hine mo&s;t in the &s;enate;
that of the other, on the theatre.</P>
<P>THESE, I &s;ay, are the <HI>natural</HI> effects of &s;uch cu&s;|toms.
For it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that chance has a
great influence on national manners; and many events
happen in &s;ociety, which are not to be accounted for
by general rules. Who could imagine, for in&s;tance,
that the ROMANS, who lived freely with their women,
&s;hould be very indifferent about mu&s;ic, and e&s;teem
dancing infamous: While the GREEKS, who never
almo&s;t &s;aw a woman but in their own hou&s;es, were
continually piping, &s;inging, and dancing?</P>
<P>THE differences of moral &s;entiment, which natu|rally
ari&s;e from a republican or monarchical govern|ment,
<PB N="248" REF="244">
are al&s;o very obvious; as well as tho&s;e, which
proceed from general riches or poverty, union or
faction, ignorance or learning. I &s;hall conclude this
long di&s;cour&s;e with ob&s;erving, that different cu&s;toms
and &s;ituations vary not the original ideas of merit
(however they may, &s;ome con&s;equences) in any very
e&s;&s;ential point, and prevail chiefly with regard to
young men, who can a&s;pire to the agreeable qualities,
and may attempt to plea&s;e. The MANNER, the
ORNAMENTS, the GRACES, which &s;ucceed in
this &s;hape, are more arbitrary and ca&s;ual: But the
merit of riper years is almo&s;t every-where the &s;ame;
and con&s;i&s;t chiefly in integrity, humanity, ability,
knowledge and the other more &s;olid and u&s;eful quali|ties
of the human mind.</P>
<P>WHAT you in&s;i&s;t on, replied PALAMEDES, may
have &s;ome foundation, when you adhere to the max|ims
of common life and ordinary conduct. Experi|ence
and the practice of the world readily correct any
great extravagance on either &s;ide. But what &s;ay you
to <HI>artificial</HI> lives and manners? How do you reconcile
the maxims, on which in different ages and nations,
the&s;e are founded?</P>
<P>WHAT do you under&s;tand by <HI>artificial</HI> lives and
manners? &s;aid I. I explain my&s;elf, replied he. You
know, that religion had, in antient times, very little
influence on common life, and that, after men had
<PB N="249" REF="245">
performed their duty in &s;acrifices and prayers at the
temple, they thought, that the gods left the re&s;t of
their conduct to them&s;elves, and were little plea&s;ed or
offended with tho&s;e virtues or vices, which only af|fected
the peace and happine&s;s of human &s;ociety. In
tho&s;e ages, it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophy alone to
regulate men's ordinary behaviour and deportment;
and accordingly, we may ob&s;erve, that this being the
&s;ole principle, by which a man could elevate him&s;elf
above his fellows, it acquired a mighty a&s;cendant
over many, and produced great &s;ingularities of max|ims
and of conduct. At pre&s;ent, that philo&s;ophy has
lo&s;t the allurement of novelty, it has no &s;uch exten&s;ive
influence; but &s;eems to confine it&s;elf mo&s;tly to &s;pecu|lations
in the clo&s;et; in the &s;ame manner, as the an|tient
religion was limited to &s;acrifices in the temple.
Its place is now &s;upplied by the modern religion,
which in&s;pects our whole conduct, and pre&s;cribes an
univer&s;al rule to our actions, to our words, to our
very thoughts and inclinations; a rule &s;o much the
more au&s;tere, that it is guarded by infinite, though
di&s;tant, rewards and puni&s;hments; and no infraction
of it can ever be concealed or di&s;gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>DIOGENES is the mo&s;t celebrated model of extra|vagant
philo&s;ophy. Let us &s;eek a parallel to him in
modern times. We &s;hall not di&s;grace any philo&s;ophic
name by a compari&s;on with the DOMINICS or
LOYOLAS, or any canonized monk or friar. Let us
<PB N="250" REF="246">
compare him to PASCAL, a man of parts and genius
as well as DIOGENES him&s;elf; and perhaps too, a
man of virtue, had he allowed his virtuous inclinations
to have exerted and di&s;played them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE foundation of DIOGENES'S conduct was an
endeavour to render him&s;elf an independent being as
much as po&s;&s;ible, and to confine all his wants and de|&s;ires
and plea&s;ures within him&s;elf and his own mind:
The aim of PASCAL was to keep a perpetual &s;en&s;e
of his dependance before his eyes, and never to forget
his numberle&s;s wants and nece&s;&s;ities. The antient
&s;upported him&s;elf by magnanimity, o&s;tentation, pride,
and the idea of his own &s;uperiority above his fellow|creatures.
The modern made con&s;tant profe&s;&s;ion of
humility and aba&s;ement, of the contempt and hatred
of him&s;elf; and endeavoured to attain the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed
virtues, as far as they are attainable. The au&s;terities
of the GREEK were in order to inure him&s;elf to hard|&s;hips,
and prevent his ever &s;uffering: Tho&s;e of the
FRENCHMAN were embraced merely for their own
&s;ake, and in order to &s;uffer as much as po&s;&s;ible. The
philo&s;opher indulged him&s;elf in the mo&s;t bea&s;tly plea|&s;ures,
even in public: The &s;aint refu&s;ed him&s;elf the
mo&s;t innocent, even in private. The former thought
it his duty to love his freinds, and to rail at them, and
reprove them, and &s;cold them: The latter endeavour|ed
to be ab&s;olutely indifferent towards his neare&s;t rela|tions,
and to love and &s;peak well of his enemies. The
<PB N="251" REF="247">
great object of DIOGENES's wit was every kind of &s;u|per&s;tition,
that is, every kind of religion known in
his time. The mortality of the &s;oul was his &s;tandard
principle; and even his &s;entiments of a divine provi|dence
&s;eem to have been very licentious. The mo&s;t
ridiculous &s;uper&s;titions directed PASCAL'S faith and
practice; and an extreme contempt of this life, in
compari&s;on of the future, was the chief foundation of
his conduct.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a remarkable contra&s;t do the&s;e two men
&s;tand: Yet both of them have met with general ad|miration
in their different ages, and have been pro|po&s;ed
as models of imitation. Where then is the uni|ver&s;al
&s;tandard of morals, which you talk of? And
what rule &s;hall we e&s;tabli&s;h for the many different,
nay contrary &s;entiments of mankind?</P>
<P>AN experiment, &s;aid I, which &s;ucceeds in the air,
will not always &s;ucceed in a vacuum. When men de|part
from the maxims of common rea&s;on, and affect
the&s;e <HI>artificial</HI> lives, as you call them, no-one can an|&s;wer
for what will plea&s;e or di&s;plea&s;e them. They are
in a different element from the re&s;t of mankind; and
the natural principles of their mind play not with the
&s;ame regularity, as if left to them&s;elves, free from the
illu&s;ions of religious &s;uper&s;tition or philo&s;ophical en|thu&s;ia&s;m.</P>

<HEAD>THE
NATURAL HISTORY
OF
RELIGION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS every enquiry, which regards religion is of the
utmo&s;t importance, there are two que&s;tions in
particular, which challenge our principal attention,
to wit, that concerning its foundation in rea&s;on, and
that concerning its origin in human nature. Happily,
the fir&s;t que&s;tion, which is the mo&s;t important, ad|mits
of the mo&s;t obvious, at lea&s;t, the cleare&s;t &s;olu|tion.
The whole frame of nature be&s;peaks an intel|ligent
author; and no rational enquirer can, after &s;e|rious
reflexion, &s;u&s;pend his belief a moment with re|gard
to the primary principles of genuine Thei&s;m
and Religion. But the other que&s;tion, concerning
<PB N="254" REF="249">
the origin of religion in human nature, is expo&s;ed to
&s;ome more difficulty. The belief of invi&s;ible, intel|ligent
power has been very generally diffu&s;ed over
the human race, in all places and in all ages; but it
has neither perhaps been &s;o univer&s;al as to admit of
no exceptions, nor has it been, in any degree, uni|form
in the ideas, which it has &s;ugge&s;ted. Some
nations have been di&s;covered, who entertained no
&s;entiments of Religion, if travellers and hi&s;torians
may be credited; and no two nations, and &s;carce any
two men, have ever agreed preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;en|timents.
It would appear, therefore, that this pre|conception
&s;prings not from an original in&s;tinct or
primary impre&s;&s;ion of nature, &s;uch as gives ri&s;e to
&s;elf-love, affection between the &s;exes, love of pro|geny,
gratitude, re&s;entment; &s;ince every in&s;tinct of
this kind has been found ab&s;olutely univer&s;al in all
nations and ages, and has always a preci&s;e determi|nate
object, which it inflexibly pur&s;ues. The fir&s;t re|ligious
principles mu&s;t be &s;econdary; &s;uch as may
ea&s;ily be perverted by various accidents and cau&s;es,
and who&s;e operation too, in &s;ome ca&s;es, may, by an
extraordinary concurrence of circum&s;tances, be alto|gether
prevented. What tho&s;e principles are, which
give ri&s;e to the original belief, and what tho&s;e acci|dents
and cau&s;es are, which direct its operation, is the
&s;ubject of our pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="255" REF="250">
<HEAD>SECT. 1. That Polythei&s;m was the primary Religion
of Men.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears to me, that if we con&s;ider the improve|ment
of human &s;ociety, from rude beginnings to a
&s;tate of greater prefection, polythei&s;m or idolatry
was, and nece&s;&s;arily mu&s;t have been, the fir&s;t and
mo&s;t antient religion of mankind. This opinion I
&s;hall endeavour to confirm by the following argu|ments.</P>
<P>'TIS
a matter of fact inconte&s;table, that about
1700 years ago all mankind were idolaters. The
doubtful and &s;ceptical principles of a few philo&s;o|phers,
or the thei&s;m, and that too not entirely pure, of
one or two nations, form no objection worth regard|ing.
Behold then the clear te&s;timony of hi&s;tory. The
farther we mount up into antiquity, the more do we
find mankind plunged into idolatry. No marks, no
&s;ymptoms of any more perfect religion. The mo&s;t
antient records of human race &s;till pre&s;ent us with
polythei&s;m as the popular and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem.
The north, the &s;outh, the ea&s;t, the we&s;t, give their
unanimous te&s;timony to the &s;ame fact. What can be
oppo&s;ed to &s;o full an evidence?</P>
<P>As far as writing or hi&s;tory reaches, mankind, in
antient times, appear univer&s;ally to have been poly|thei&s;ts.
<PB N="256" REF="251">
Shall we a&s;&s;ert, that, in more antient times,
before the knowledge of letters, or the di&s;covery of
any art or &s;cience, men entertained the principles of
pure thei&s;m? That is, while they were ignorant and
barbarous, they di&s;covered truth: But fell into error,
as &s;oon as they acquired learning and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT in this a&s;&s;ertion you not only contradict all
appearance of probability, but al&s;o our pre&s;ent expe|rience
concerning the principles and opinions of bar|barous
nations. The &s;avage tribes of AMERICA,
AFRICA, and ASIA are all idolaters. Not a &s;ingle
exceptions to this rule. In&s;omuch, that, were a tra|veller
to tran&s;port him&s;elf into any unknown region;
if he found inhabitants cultivated with arts and &s;ci|ences,
tho' even upon that &s;uppo&s;ition there are odds
again&s;t their being thei&s;ts, yet could he not &s;afely,
till farther enquiry, pronounce any thing on that
head: But if he found them ignorant and barbarous,
he might beforehand declare them idolaters; and
there &s;carce is a po&s;&s;ibility of his being mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems certain, that, according to the natural
progre&s;s of human thought, the ignorant multitude
mu&s;t fir&s;t entertain &s;ome groveling and familiar notion
of &s;uperior powers, before they &s;tretch their concep|tion
to that perfect Being, who be&s;towed order on
the whole frame of nature. We may as rea&s;onably
imagine, that men inhabited palaces before huts and
<PB N="257" REF="252">
cottages, or &s;tudied geometry before agriculture; as
a&s;&s;ert that the Deity appeared to them a pure &s;pirit,
omni&s;cient, omnipotent, and omnipre&s;ent, before he
was apprehended to be a powerful, tho' limited be|ing,
with human pa&s;&s;ions and appetites, limbs and
organs. The mind ri&s;es gradually, from inferior to
&s;uperior: By ab&s;tracting from what is imperfect, it
forms an idea of perfection: And &s;lowly di&s;tingui&s;h|ing
the nobler parts of its frame from the gro&s;&s;er, it
learns to transfer only the former, much elevated and
refined, to its divinity. Nothing could di&s;turb this
natural progre&s;s of thought, but &s;ome obvious and
invincible argument, which might immediately lead
the mind into the pure principles of thei&s;m, and
make it overleap, at one bound, the va&s;t interval,
which is interpo&s;ed between the human and the di|vine
nature. But tho' I allow, that the order and
frame of the univer&s;e, when accurately examined,
affords &s;uch an argument; yet I can never think
that this con&s;ideration could have an influence on
mankind when they formed their fir&s;t rude notions of
religion.</P>
<P>THE cau&s;es of objects, which are quite familiar to
us, never &s;trike our attention or curio&s;ity; and how|ever
extraordinary or &s;urprizing the&s;e objects may be
in them&s;elves, they are pa&s;&s;ed over, by the raw and
ignorant multitude, without much examination or
enquiry. ADAM, ri&s;ing at once, in paradi&s;e, and in
<PB N="258" REF="253">
the full perfection of his facculties, would naturally,
as repre&s;ented by MILTON, be a&s;toni&s;hed at the glo|rious
appearances of nature, the heavens, the air, the
earth, his own organs and members; and would be
led to a&s;k, whence this wonderful &s;cene aro&s;e. But a
barbarous, nece&s;&s;itous animal (&s;uch as man is on the
fir&s;t origin of &s;ociety) pre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch numerous wants
and pa&s;&s;ions, has no lei&s;ure to admire the regular
face of nature, or make enquiries concerning the
cau&s;e of objects, to which, from his infancy, he has
been gradually accu&s;tomed. On the contrary, the more
regular and uniform, that is, the more perfect, na|ture
appears, the more is he familiarized to it, and
the le&s;s inclined to &s;crutinize and examine it. A
mon&s;trous birth excites his curio&s;ity, and is deemed a
prodigy. It alarms him from its novelty; and im|mediately
&s;ets him a trembling, and &s;acrificing, and
praying. But an animal compleat in all its limbs and
organs, is to him an ordinary &s;pectacle, and pro|duces
no religious opinion or affection. A&s;k him,
whence that animal aro&s;e; he will tell you, from the
copulation of its parents. And the&s;e, whence?
From the copulation of theirs. A few removes &s;a|tisfy
his curio&s;ity, and &s;et the objects at &s;uch a di&s;|tance,
that he entirely lo&s;es &s;ight of them. Imagine
not, that he will &s;o much as &s;tart the que&s;tion, whence
the fir&s;t animal; much le&s;s, whence the whole &s;y&s;tem
or united fabric of the univer&s;e aro&s;e. Or, if you
&s;tart &s;uch a que&s;tion to him, expect not, that he will
<PB N="259" REF="254">
employ his mind with any anxiety about a &s;ubject,
&s;o remote, &s;o unintere&s;ting, and which &s;o much ex|ceeds
the bounds of his capacity.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if men were at fir&s;t led into the be|lief
of one &s;upreme Being, by rea&s;oning from the
frame of nature, they could never po&s;&s;ibly leave that
belief, in order to embrace idolatry; but the &s;ame
principles of rea&s;oning, which at fir&s;t produced and
diffu&s;ed over mankind, &s;o magnificent an opinion,
mu&s;t be able, with greater facility, to pre&s;erve it.
The fir&s;t invention and proof of any doctrine is in|finitely
more difficult than the &s;upporting and retain|ing
it.</P>
<P>THERE is a great difference between hi&s;torical
facts and &s;peculative opinions; nor is the knowledge
of the one propagated in the &s;ame manner with that
of the other. An hi&s;torical fact, while it pa&s;&s;es by
oral tradition from eye-witne&s;&s;es and contemporaries,
is di&s;gui&s;ed in every &s;ucce&s;&s;ive narration, and may at
la&s;t retain but very &s;mall, if any, re&s;emblance of the
original truth, on which it was founded. The frail
memories of men, their love of exaggeration, their
&s;upine carele&s;ne&s;s; the&s;e principles, if not corrected
by books and writing, &s;oon pervert the account of
hi&s;torical events, where argument or rea&s;oning has
little or no place; nor can ever recal the truth, which
<PB N="260" REF="255">
has once e&s;caped tho&s;e narrations. 'Tis thus the
fables of HERCULES, THESEUS, BACCHUS are &s;up|po&s;ed
to have been originally founded in true hi&s;tory,
corrupted by tradition. But with regard to &s;pecula|tive
opinions, the ca&s;e is far otherwi&s;e. If the&s;e opi|nions
be founded in arguments &s;o clear and obvious
as to carry conviction with the generality of man|kind,
the &s;ame arguments, which at fir&s;t diffu&s;ed the
opinions, will &s;till pre&s;erve them in their original pu|rity.
If the arguments be more ab&s;tru&s;e, and more
remote from vulgar apprehen&s;ions, the opinions will
always be confined to a few per&s;ons; and as &s;oon as
men leave the contemplation of the arguments, the
opinions will immediately be lo&s;t and be buried in obli|vion.
Which ever &s;ide of this dilemma we take, it
mu&s;t appear impo&s;&s;ible, that thei&s;m could, from rea|&s;oning,

<HEAD>SECT. II. Origin of Polythei&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>In we would, therefore, indulge our curio&s;ity, in
enquiring concerning the origin of religion, we mu&s;t
turn our thoughts towards idolatry or polythei&s;m, the
primitive Religion of unin&s;tructed mankind.</P>
<P>WERE men led into the apprehen&s;ion of invi&s;ible,
intelligent power by a contemplation of the works of
nature, they could never po&s;&s;ibly entertain any con|ception
but of one &s;ingle being, who be&s;towed exi&s;t|ence
and order on this va&s;t machine, and adju&s;ted all
its parts, according to one regular plan or connected
&s;y&s;tem. For tho', to per&s;ons of a certain turn of
mind, it may not appear altogether ab&s;urd, that &s;eve|ral
independent beings, endowed with &s;uperior wi&s;dom,
might con&s;pire in the contrivance and execution of
one regular plan; yet is this a mere arbitrary &s;uppo|&s;ition,
which, even if allowed po&s;&s;ible, mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed
neither to be &s;upported by probability nor ne|ce&s;&s;ity.
All things in the univer&s;e are evidently of a
piece. Every thing is adju&s;ted to every thing. One
de&s;ign prevails thro' the whole. And this uniformity
leads the mind to acknowledge one author; becau&s;e
the conception of different authors, without any di&s;|tinction
of attributes or operations, &s;erves only to
<PB N="262" REF="257">
give perplexity to the imagination, without be&s;tow|ing
any &s;atisfaction on the under&s;tanding<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The &s;tatue of LAOCOON, as we learn from PLINY, was the work of three arti&s;ts: But 'tis certain, that, were we not told &s;o, we &s;hould never have concluded, that a groupe of figures, cut from one &s;tone, and united in one plan, was not the work and contrivance of one &s;tatuary. To a&s;cribe any &s;ingle effect to the combination of &s;everal cau&s;es, is not &s;urely a natural and obvious &s;uppo&s;ition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if, leaving the works of na|ture,
we trace the foot&s;teps of invi&s;ible power in the
various and contrary events of human life, we are
nece&s;&s;arily led into polythei&s;m and to the acknow|ledgement
of &s;everal limited and imperfect deities.
Storms and tempe&s;ts ruin what is nouri&s;hed by the
&s;un. The &s;un de&s;troys what is fo&s;tered by the moi&s;|ture
of dews and rains. War may be favourable to
a nation, whom the inclemency of the &s;ea&s;ons af|flicts
with famine. Sickne&s;s and pe&s;tilence may de|populate
a kingdom, amid&s;t the mo&s;t profu&s;e plenty.
The &s;ame nation is not, at the &s;ame time, equally
&s;ucce&s;sful by &s;ea and by land. And a nation, which
now triumphs over its enemies, may anon &s;ubmit to
their more pro&s;perous arms. In &s;hort, the conduct of
events, or what we call the plan of a particular pro|vidence,
is &s;o full of variety and uncertainty, that,
if we &s;uppo&s;e it immediately ordered by any intelli|gent
<PB N="263" REF="258">
beings, we mu&s;t acknowledge a contrariety in
their de&s;igns and intentions, a con&s;tant combat of
oppo&s;ite powers, and a repentance or change of in|tention
in the &s;ame power, from impotence or levity.
Each nation has its tutelar deity. Each element is
&s;ubjected to its invi&s;ible power or agent. The pro|vince
of each god is &s;eparate from that of another.
Nor are the operations of the &s;ame god always cer|tain
and invariable: To day he protects: To mor|row
he abandons us. Prayers and &s;acrifices, rites
and ceremonies, well or ill performed, are the &s;ources
of his favour or enmity, and produce all the good
or ill fortune, which are to be found among&s;t man|kind.</P>
<P>WE
may conclude, therefore, that in all nations,
which have embraced polythei&s;m or idolatry, the fir&s;t
ideas of religion aro&s;e not from a contemplation of
the works of nature, but from a concern with regard
to the events of life, and from the ince&s;&s;ant hopes
and fears, which actuate the human mind. Accord|ingly,
we find, that all idolators, having &s;eparated
the provinces of their deities, have recour&s;e to that
invi&s;ible agent, to who&s;e authority they are immedi|ately
&s;ubjected, and who&s;e province it is to &s;uperin|tend
that cour&s;e of actions, in which they are, at any
time, engaged. JUNO is invoked at marriages;
LUCINA at births. NEPTUNE receives the prayers
<PB N="264" REF="259">
of &s;eamen; and MARS of warriors. The hu&s;band|man
cultivates his field under the protection of CERES;
and the merchant acknowledges the authority of
MERCURY. Each natural event is &s;uppo&s;ed to be
governed by &s;ome intelligent agent; and nothing pro&s;|perous
or adver&s;e can happen in life, which may not
be the &s;ubject of peculiar prayers or thank&s;givings<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">&startq;Fragilis et laborio&s;a mortalitas in partes i&s;ta dige&s;&s;it, in|firmitatis &s;uae memor, ut portionibus qui&s;quis coleret, quo maxime indigeret.&endq; PLIN. lib. ii. cap. 7 So early as HE|SIOD'S time there were 30,000 deities. <HI>Oper. &amp; Dier.</HI> lib. i. ver. 250.

<P>IT mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily, indeed, be allowed, that, in
order to carry men's attention beyond the pre&s;ent
cour&s;e of things, or lead them into any inference con|cerning
invi&s;ible intelligent power, they mu&s;t be actu|ated
by &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, which prompts their thought and
reflection; &s;ome motive, which urges their fir&s;t enqui|ry.
But what pa&s;&s;ion &s;hall we here have recour&s;e to, for
explaining an effect of &s;uch mighty con&s;equence? Not
&s;peculative curio&s;ity &s;urely, or the pure love of truth.
That motive is too refined for &s;uch gro&s;s apprehen|&s;ions,
<PB N="265" REF="260">
and would lead men into enquiries concerning
the frame of nature; a &s;ubject too large and com|prehen&s;ive
for their narrow capacities. No pa&s;&s;ions,
therefore, can be &s;uppo&s;ed to work upon &s;uch bar|barians,
but the ordinary affections of human life;
the anxious concern for happine&s;s, the dread of fu|ture
mi&s;ery, the terror of death, the thir&s;t of re|venge,
the appetite for food and other nece&s;&s;aries.
Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature, e&s;pecially
the latter, men &s;crutinize, with a trembling curio&s;ity,
the cour&s;e of future cau&s;es, and examine the various
contrary events of human life. And in this di&s;or|dered

<HEAD>SECT. III. The &s;ame &s;ubject continued.</HEAD>
<P>WE are placed in this world, as in a great theatre,
where the true &s;prings and cau&s;es of every event, are
entirely unknown to us; non have we either &s;ufficient
wi&s;dom to fore&s;ee, or power to prevent tho&s;e ills,
with which we are continually threatened. We hang
in perpetual &s;u&s;pen&s;e between life and death, health
and &s;ickne&s;s, plenty and want; which are di&s;tributed
among&s;t the human &s;pecies by &s;ecret and unknown
cau&s;es, who&s;e operation is oft unexpected, and al|ways
unaccountable. The&s;e <HI>unknown cau&s;es,</HI> then,
become the con&s;tant object of our hope and fear&punc;
<PB N="266" REF="261">
and while the pa&s;&s;ions are kept in perpetual alarm by
an anxious expectation of the events, the imagination
is equally employed in forming ideas of tho&s;e powers,
on which we have &s;o entire a dependance. Could
men anatomize nature, according to the mo&s;t pro|bable,
at lea&s;t the mo&s;t intelligible philo&s;ophy, they
would find, that the&s;e cau&s;es are nothing but the par|ticular
fabric and &s;tructure of the minute parts of
their own bodies and of external objects; and that,
by a regular and con&s;tant machinery, all the events
are produced, about which they are &s;o much con|cerned.
But this philo&s;ophy exceeds the compre|hen&s;ion
of the ignorant multitude, who can only con|ceive
the <HI>unknown cau&s;es</HI> in a general and confu&s;ed
manner; tho' their imagination, perpetually em|ployed
on the &s;ame &s;ubject, mu&s;t labour to form &s;ome
particular and di&s;tinct idea of them. The more they
con&s;ider the&s;e cau&s;es them&s;elves, and the uncertainty
of their operation, the le&s;s &s;atisfaction do they meet
with in their re&s;earch; and, however unwilling, they
mu&s;t at la&s;t have abandoned &s;o arduous an attempt,
were it not for a propen&s;ity in human nature, which
leads into a &s;y&s;tem, that gives them &s;ome &s;eeming
&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE is an univer&s;al tendency among&s;t mankind
to conceive all beings like them&s;elves, and to transfer
to every object, tho&s;e qualities, with which they are
familiarly acquainted, and of which they are inti|mately
<PB N="267" REF="262">
con&s;cious. We find human faces in the moon,
armies in the clouds; and by a natural propen&s;ity, if
not corrected by experience and reflection, a&s;cribe
malice and good-will to every thing, that hurts or
plea&s;es us. Hence the frequency and beauty of the
<HI>pro&s;opopoeia</HI> in poetry, where trees, mountains and
&s;treams are per&s;onified, and the inanimate parts of na|ture
acquire &s;entiment and pa&s;&s;ion. And tho' the&s;e
poetical figures and expre&s;&s;ions gain not on the belief,
they may &s;erve, at lea&s;t, to prove a certain tendency
in the imagination, without which they could neither
be beautiful nor natural. Nor is a river-god or hama|dryad
always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary
per&s;onage; but may &s;ometimes enter into the real
$reed of the ignorant vulgar; while each grove or
field is repre&s;ented as po&s;&s;e&s;t of a particular <HI>genius</HI> or
invi&s;ible power, which inhabits or protects it. Nay,
philo&s;ophers cannot entirely exempt them&s;elves from
this natural frailty; but have oft a&s;cribed to inanimate
matter the horror of a <HI>vacuum,</HI> &s;ympathies, antipath$es,
and other affections of human nature. The ab&s;urdity
is not le&s;s, while we ca&s;t our eyes upwards; and tran&s;|ferring,
as is too u&s;ual, human pa&s;&s;ions and infirmities
to the deity, repre&s;ent him as jealous and revengeful,
capricious and partial, and, in &s;hort, a wicked and
fooli&s;h man in every re&s;pect, but his &s;uperior power
and authority. No wonder, then, that mankind, be|ing
placed in &s;uch an ab&s;olute ignorance of cau&s;es,
and being at the &s;ame time &s;o anxious concerning
<PB N="268" REF="263">
their future fortunes, &s;hould immediately acknow|ledge
a dependence on invi&s;ible powers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
&s;entiment and intelligence. The <HI>unknown cau&s;es,</HI>
which continually employ their thought, appearing
always in the &s;ame a&s;pect, are all apprehended to be
of the &s;ame kind or &s;pecies. Nor is it long before
we a&s;cribe to them thought, and rea&s;on, and pa&s;&s;ion,
and &s;ometimes even the limbs and figures of men,
in order to bring them nearer to a re&s;emblance with
our&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN proportion as any man's cour&s;e of life is go|verned
by accident, we always find, that he encrea&s;es
in &s;uper&s;tition; as may particularly be ob&s;erved of
game&s;ters and &s;ailors, who, tho' of all mankind, the
lea&s;t capable of &s;erious meditation, abound mo&s;t in fri|volous
and &s;uper&s;titious apprehen&s;ions. The gods,
&s;ays CORIOLANUS in DIONYSIUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii.</NOTE>, have an influ|ence
in every affair; but above all, in war; where
the event is &s;o uncertain. All human life, e&s;pecially
before the in&s;titution of order and good government,
being &s;ubject to fortuitous accidents; it is natural,
that &s;uper&s;tition &s;hould prevail every where in barba|rous
ages, and put men on the mo&s;t earne&s;t enquiry
concerning tho&s;e invi&s;ible powers, who di&s;po&s;e of
their happine&s;s or mi&s;ery. Ignorant of a&s;tronomy
and the anatomy of plants and animals, and too little
<PB N="269" REF="264">
curious to ob&s;erve the admirable adju&s;tment of final
cau&s;es; they remain &s;till unacquainted with a fir&s;t and
&s;upreme creator, and with that infinitely perfect &s;pirit,
who alone, by his almighty will, be&s;towed order on
the whole frame of nature. Such a magnificent idea
is too big for their narrow conceptions, which can
neither ob&s;erve the beauty of the work, nor compre|hend
the grandeur of its author. They &s;uppo&s;e their
deities, however potent and invi&s;ible, to be nothing
but a &s;pecies of human creatures, perhaps rai&s;ed from
among mankind, and retaining all human pa&s;&s;ions
and appetites, together with corporeal limbs and or|gans.
Such limited beings, tho' ma&s;ters of human
fate, being, each of them, incapable of extending
his influence every where, mu&s;t be va&s;tly multiplied,
in order to an&s;wer that variety of events, which hap|pen
over the whole face of nature. Thus every place
is &s;tored with a crowd of local deities; and thus ido|latry

ANY of the human affections may lead us into
the notion of invi&s;ible, intelligent power; hope as
well as fear, gratitude as well as affliction: But if
we examine our own hearts, or ob&s;erve what pa&s;&s;es
around us, we &s;hall find, that men are much oftener
thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the
agreeable pa&s;&s;ions. Pro&s;perity is ea&s;ily received as
our due, and few que&s;tions are a&s;ked concerning its
cau&s;e or author. It begets cheerfulne&s;s and activity
and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every &s;ocial
and &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ure: And during this &s;tate of mind,
men have little lei&s;ure or inclination to think of the
unknown invi&s;ible regions. On the other hand,
every di&s;a&s;trous accident alarms us, and &s;ets us on
enquiries concerning the principles whence it aro&s;e:
Apprehen&s;ions &s;pring up with regard to futurity: And
the mind, &s;unk into diffidence, terror, and melan|choly,
has recour&s;e to every method of appea&s;ing
tho&s;e &s;ecret, intelligent powers, on whom our fortune
is &s;uppo&s;ed entirely to depend.</P>
<P>NO topic is more u&s;ual with all popular divines

make them forgetful of a divine providence.

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Deities not con&s;idered as creators or formers
of the world.</HEAD>
<P>THE only point of theology, in which we &s;hall
find a con&s;ent of mankind almo&s;t univer&s;al, is, that
there is invi&s;ible, intelligent power in the world: But
whether this power be &s;upreme or &s;ubordinate, whe|ther
confined to one being, or di&s;tributed among &s;e|veral,
what attributes, qualities, connexions or prin|ciples
of action ought to be a&s;cribed to tho&s;e beings;
concerning all the&s;e points, there is the wide&s;t diffe|rence
in the popular &s;y&s;tems of theology. Our ance&s;|tors
in EUROPE, before the revival of letters, believed,
as we do at pre&s;ent, that there was one &s;upreme God,
the author of nature, who&s;e power, tho', in it&s;elf,
uncontroulable, was yet often exerted by the interpo|&s;ition
of his angels and &s;ubordinate mini&s;ters, who
executed his &s;acred purpo&s;es. But they al&s;o believed,
that all nature was full of other invi&s;ible powers;
fairies, goblins, elves, &s;prights; beings, &s;tronger and
mightier than men, but much inferior to the cele&s;tial
natures, who &s;urround the throne of God. Now
&s;uppo&s;e, that any one, in tho&s;e ages, had denied the
exi&s;tence of God and of his angels; would not his
impiety ju&s;$ly have de&s;erved the appellation of athei&s;m,
even tho' he had &s;till allowed, by &s;ome odd capricious
rea&s;oning, that the popular &s;tories of elves and fairies
<PB N="273" REF="268">
were ju&s;t and well-grounded? The difference, on
the other hand, between &s;uch a per&s;on and a genuine
thei&s;t is infinitely greater than that, on the other, be|tween
him and one, that ab&s;olutely excludes all in|vi&s;ible
intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely
from the ca&s;ual re&s;emblance of names, without any
conformity of meaning, to rank &s;uch oppo&s;ite opinions

<P>To any one, who con&s;iders ju&s;tly of the matter, it

<HEAD>SECT. V. Various Forms of Polythei&s;m; Allegory,
Hero-Wor&s;hip.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is chiefly our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s to con&s;ider the
gro&s;s polythei&s;m and idolatry of the vulgar, and to
trace all its various appearances, in the principles of
human nature, whence they are derived.</P>
<P>WHOEVER learns, by argument, the exi&s;tence of
invi&s;ible, intelligent power, mu&s;t rea&s;on from the ad|mirable
contrivance of natural objects, and mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e
the world to be the workman&s;hip of that divine
being, the original cau&s;e of all things. But the vulgar
polythei&s;t, &s;o far from admitting that idea, deifies
every part of the univer&s;e, and conceives all the con|&s;picuous
productions of nature, to be them&s;elves &s;o
many real divinities. The &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, are
<PB N="283" REF="278">
all gods, according to his &s;y&s;tem: Fountains are in|habited
by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even
monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become
&s;acred in his eyes, and &s;trike him with a religious ve|neration.
And thus, however &s;trong men's propen|&s;ity
to believe invi&s;ible, intelligent power in nature,
their propen&s;ity is equally &s;trong to re&s;t their attention
on &s;en&s;ible, vi&s;ible objects; and in order to recon|cile
the&s;e oppo&s;ite inclinations, they are led to unite
the invi&s;ible power with &s;ome vi&s;ible object.</P>
<P>THE di&s;tribution al&s;o of di&s;tinct provinces to the
&s;everal deities is apt to cau&s;e &s;ome allegory, both
phy&s;ical and moral, to enter into the vulgar &s;y&s;tems
of polythei&s;m. The god of war will naturally be
repre&s;ented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The
god of poetry as elegant, polite, and amiable: The
god of merchandi&s;e, e&s;pecially in early times, as thievi&s;h
and deceitful. The allegories, &s;uppo&s;ed in HOMER and
other mythologi&s;ts, I allow, have been often &s;o &s;train|ed,
that men of &s;en&s;e are apt entirely to reject them,
and to con&s;ider them as the product merely of the
fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But
that allegory really has place in the heathen mytho|logy
is undeniable even on the lea&s;t reflection. CU|PID
the &s;on of VENUS; the Mu&s;es the daughters of
memory; PROMETHEUS, the wi&s;e brother, and EPI|METHEUS
the fooli&s;h; HYGIEIA or the godde&s;s of
health de&s;cended from AESCULAPIUS or the god of

phy&s;ic: Who &s;ees not, in the&s;e, and in many other
in&s;tances, the plain traces of allegory? When a god
is &s;uppo&s;ed to pre&s;ide over any pa&s;&s;ion, event, or &s;y&s;|tem
of actions, it is almo&s;t unavoidable to give him
a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, &s;uitable to
his &s;uppo&s;ed powers and influence; and to carry on
that &s;imilitude and compari&s;on, which is naturally &s;o
agreeable to the mind of man.</P>
<P>ALLE$ORIES, indeed, entirely perfect, we ought
not to expect as the products of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition;
there being no work of genius, that re|quires
a nicer hand, or has been more rarely executed

<P>WE may conclude, therefore, upon the whole, that
&s;ince the vulgar, in nations, which have embraced
<PB N="291" REF="286">
the doctrine of thei&s;m, &s;till build it upon irrational
and &s;uper&s;titious opinions, they are never led into
that opinion by any proce&s;s of argument, but by a
certain train of thinking, more &s;uitable to their ge|nius
and capacity.</P>
<P>IT may readily happen, in an idolatrous nation,
that, tho' men admit the exi&s;tence of &s;everal limited
deities, yet may there be &s;ome one God, whom, in
a particular manner, they make the object of their
wor&s;hip and adoration. They may either &s;uppo&s;e, that,
in the di&s;tribution of power and territory among the
gods, their nation was &s;ubjected to the juri&s;diction of
that particular deity; or reducing heavenly objects to
the model of things below, they may repre&s;ent one
god as the prince or &s;upreme magi&s;trate of the re&s;t,
who, tho' of the &s;ame nature, rules them with an au|thority,
like that which an earthly &s;overeign exerci&s;es
over his &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als. Whether this god,
therefore, be con&s;idered as their peculiar patron, or
as the general &s;overeign of heaven, his votaries will
endeavour, by every act, to in&s;inuate them&s;elves, into
his favour; and &s;uppo&s;ing him to be plea&s;ed, like
them&s;elves, with prai&s;e and flattery, there is no eulogy
or exaggeration, which will be &s;pared in their addre&s;&s;es
to him. In proportion as men's fears or di&s;tre&s;&s;es be|come
more urgent, they &s;till invent new &s;trains of
adulation; and even he who out-does his predece&s;&s;ors
<PB N="292" REF="287">
in &s;welling up the titles of his divinity, is &s;ure to be
out-done by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in newer and more pompous
epithets of prai&s;e. Thus they proceed; till at la&s;t
they arrive at infinity it&s;elf, beyond which there is
no farther progre&s;s: And it is well, if, in &s;triving to
get farther, and to repre&s;ent a magnificent &s;implicity,
they run not into inexplicable my&s;tery, and de&s;troy
the intelligent nature of their deity; on which alone
any rational wor&s;hip or adoration can be founded.
While the confine them&s;elves to the notion of a per|fect
being, the creator of the world, they coincide,
by chance, with the principles of rea&s;on and true
philo&s;ophy; tho' they are guided to that notion, not
by rea&s;on, of which they are in a great mea&s;ure in|capable,
but by the adulation and fears of the mo&s;t
vulgar &s;uper&s;tition.</P>
<P>WE often find, among&s;t barbarous nations, and
even &s;ometimes among&s;t civilized, that, when every
&s;train of flattery has been exhau&s;ted towards arbitrary
princes, when every human quality has been ap|plauded
to the utmo&s;t; their &s;ervile courtiers repre|&s;ent
them at la&s;t, as real divinities, and point them
out to the people as objects of adoration. How
much more natural, therefore, is it, that a limited
deity, who at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;ed only the immediate
author of the particular goods and ills in life, &s;hould
<PB N="293" REF="288">
in the end be repre&s;ented as &s;overeign maker and
modi&s;ier of the univer&s;e?</P>
<P>EVEN where this notion of a &s;upreme deity is al|ready
e&s;tabli&s;hed; tho' it ought naturally to le&s;&s;en
every other wor&s;hip, and aba&s;e every object of reve|rence,
yet if a nation has entertained the opinion of
a &s;ubordinate tutelar divinity, &s;aint, or angel; their
addre&s;&s;es to that being gradually ri&s;e upon them, and
encroach on the adoration due to their &s;upreme deity.

&s;afe&s;t to comply with the higher encomiums, they en|deavour,
by an affected ravi&s;hment and devotion, to
ingratiate them&s;elves with him. As a confirmation of
this, we may ob&s;erve, that the a&s;&s;ent of the vulgar
is, in this ca&s;e, merely verbal, and that they are in|capable
of conceiving tho&s;e &s;ublime qualities, which
they &s;eemingly attribute to the Deity. Their real
idea of him, notwith&s;tanding their pompous language,

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Flux and reflux of polythei&s;m and thei&s;m.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the principles of religion
have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind,
and that men have a natural tendency to ri&s;e from
idolatry to thei&s;m, and to &s;ink again from thei&s;m into
idolatry. The vulgar, that is, indeed, all mankind,
a few excepted, being ingorant and unin&s;tructed,
never elevate their contemplation to the heavens, or
penetrate by their di&s;qui&s;itions into the &s;ecret &s;tructure
of vegetable or animal bodies; &s;o as to di&s;cover a
&s;upreme mind, or original providence, which be&s;towed
order on every part of nature. They con&s;ider the&s;e
admirable works in a more confined and &s;elfi&s;h view;
and finding their own happine&s;s and mi&s;ery to depend
on the &s;ecret influence and unfore&s;een concurrence of
external objects, they regard, with perpetual attention,
the <HI>unknown cau&s;es,</HI> which govern all the&s;e natural
events, and di&s;tribute plea&s;ure and pain, good and
ill, by their powerful, but &s;ilent, operation. The
unknown cau&s;es are &s;till appealed to, at every emer|gence;
<PB N="299" REF="294">
and in this general appearance or confu&s;ed
image, are the perpetual objects of human hopes and
fears, wi&s;hes and apprehen&s;ions. By degrees, the
active imagination of men, unea&s;y in this ab&s;tract con|ception
of objects, about which it is ince&s;&s;antly em|ployed,
begins to render them more particular, and
to clothe them in &s;hape$ more &s;uitable to its natural
comprehen&s;ion. It repre&s;ents them to be &s;en&s;ible,
intelligent beings, like mankind; actuated by love
and hatred, and flexible by gifts and entreaties, by
prayers and &s;acrifices. Hence the origin of religion:
And hence the origin of idolatry or polythei&s;m.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ame anxious concern for happine&s;s, which
begets the idea of the&s;e invi&s;ible, intelligent powers,
allows not mankind to remain long in the fir&s;t &s;imple
conception of them; as powerful, but limited beings;
ma&s;ters of human fate, but &s;laves to de&s;tiny and the
cour&s;e of nature. Men's exaggerated prai&s;es and
compliments &s;till &s;well their idea upon them; and
elevating their deities to the utmo&s;t bounds of perfec|tion,
at la&s;t beget the attributes of unity and infinity,
&s;implicity and &s;pirituality. Such refined ideas, being
&s;omewhat di&s;proportioned to vulgar comprehen&s;ion,
remain not long in their original purity; but require
to be &s;upported by the notion of inferior mediators or
&s;ubordinate agents, which interpo&s;e betwixt mankind
and their &s;upreme deity. The&s;e demi-gods or middle
beings, partaking more of human nature, and being
<PB N="300" REF="295">
more familiar to us, become the chief objects of de|votion,
and gradually recall that idolatry which had
been formerly bani&s;hed by the ardent prayers and pa|negyrics
of timorous and indigent mortals. But as
the&s;e idolatrous religions fall every day into gro&s;&s;er
and more vulgar conceptions, they at la&s;t de&s;troy them|&s;elves,
and, by the vile repre&s;entations, which they
form of their deities, make the tide turn again towards
thei&s;m. But &s;o great is the propen&s;ity, in this alter|nate
revolution of human &s;entiments, to return back
to idolatry, that the utmo&s;t precaution is not able
effectually to prevent it. And of this, &s;ome thei&s;ts,
particularly the JEWS and MAHOMETANS, have been
&s;en&s;ible; as appears by their bani&s;hing all the arts of
&s;tatuary and painting, and not allowing the repre&s;en|tations,
even of human figures, to be taken by marble
or colours; le&s;t the common infirmity of mankind
&s;hould thence produce idolatry. The feeble appre|hen&s;ions
of men cannot be &s;atisfied with conceiving
their deity as a pure &s;pirit and perfect intelligence;
and yet their natural $errors keep them from imputing
to him the lea&s;t &s;hadow of limitation and imperfection.
They fluctuate betwixt the&s;e oppo&s;ite &s;entiments.
The &s;ame infirmities &s;till drags them downwards,
from an omnipotent and &s;piritual deity, to a limited
and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited
deity to a &s;tatue or vi&s;ible repre&s;entation. The &s;ame
endeavour at elevation &s;till pu&s;hes them upwards,
<PB N="301" REF="296">

admits the gods of other &s;ects and nations to &s;hare

The ROMANS commonly adopted the gods of
the conquered people; and never di&s;puted the attri|butes
of tho&s;e topical and national deities, in who&s;e
territories they re&s;ided. The religious wars and per|&s;ecutions
of the EGYPTIAN idolaters are indeed an
exception to this rule; but are accounted for by an|tient

Different &s;pecies of animals were the deities of
the different &s;ects among the EGYPTIANS; and the

<HEAD>SECT. XI. With regard to rea&s;on or ab&s;urdity.</HEAD>
<P>HERE is another ob&s;ervation to the &s;ame purpo&s;e,
and a new proof that the corruption of the be&s;t things
begets the wor&s;t. If we examine, without prejudice,
the antient heathen mythology, as contained in the
poets, we &s;hall not di&s;cover in it any &s;uch mon&s;trous
ab&s;urdity, as we may be apt at fir&s;t to apprehend.
Where is the difficulty of conceiving, that the &s;ame
powers or principles, whatever they were, which
formed this vi&s;ible world, men and animals, produced
al&s;o a &s;pecies of intelligent creatures, of more refined
&s;ub&s;tance and greater authority than the re&s;t? That
<PB N="310" REF="305">
the&s;e creatures may be capricious, revengeful, pa&s;|&s;ionate,
voluptuous, is ea&s;ily conceived; nor is any
circum&s;tance more apt, among&s;t our&s;elves, to engen|der
&s;uch vices, than the licence of ab&s;olute authority.
And in &s;hort, the whole mythological &s;y&s;tem is &s;o na|tural,
that, in the va&s;t variety of planets and worlds,
contained in this univer&s;e, it &s;eems more than proba|ble,
that &s;omewhere or other, it is really carried into
execution.</P>
<P>THE chief objection to it with regard to this planet,
is, that it is not a&s;certained by any ju&s;t rea&s;on o$ au|thority.
The antient tradition, in&s;i&s;ted on by the
heathen prie&s;ts and theologers, is but a weak founda|tion;
and tran&s;mitted al&s;o &s;uch a number of contra|dictory
reports, &s;upported, all of them, by equal au|thority,
that it became ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible to fix a
preference among&s;t them. A few volumes, there|fore,
mu&s;t contain all the polemical writings of pagan
prie&s;ts. And their whole theology mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t more
of traditional &s;tories and &s;uper&s;titious practices than of
philo&s;ophical argument and controver&s;y.</P>
<P>BUT where thei&s;m forms the fundamental principle
of any popular religion, that tenet is &s;o conformable
to &s;ound rea&s;on, that philo&s;ophy is apt to incorporate
it&s;elf with &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of theology. And if the other
dogmas of that &s;y&s;tem be contained in a &s;acred book,
&s;uch as the Alcoran, or be determined by any vi&s;ible
<PB N="311" REF="306">
authority, like that of the ROMAN pontif, &s;peculative
rea&s;oners naturally carry on their a&s;&s;ent, and embrace
a theory, which has been in&s;tilled into them by their
earlie&s;t education, and which al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome de|gree
of con&s;i&s;tence and uniformity. But as the&s;e ap|pearances
do often, all of them, prove deceitful,
philo&s;ophy will &s;oon find her&s;elf very unequally yoaked
with her new a&s;&s;ociate; and in&s;tead of regulating each
principle, as they advance together, &s;he is at every
turn perverted to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of &s;uper&s;tition.
For be&s;ides the unavoidable incoherences, which mu&s;t
be reconciled and adju&s;ted; one may &s;afely affirm,
that all popular theology, e&s;pecially the &s;chola&s;tic,
has a kind of appetite for ab&s;urdity and contradiction.
If that theology went not beyond rea&s;on and common
&s;en&s;e, her doctrines would appear too ea&s;y and fami|liar.
Amazement mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be rai&s;ed: My&s;tery
affected: Darkne&s;s and ob&s;curity &s;ought after: And
a foundation of merit afforded the devout votaries,
who de&s;ire an opportunity of &s;ubduing their rebellious
rea&s;on, by the belief of the mo&s;t unintelligible &s;o|phi&s;ms.</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL
hi&s;tory &s;ufficiently confirms the&s;e
reflections. When a controver&s;y is &s;tarted, &s;ome peo|ple
pretend always with certainty to foretell the i&s;&s;ue:
Which ever opinion, &s;ay they, is mo&s;t contrary to
plain &s;en&s;e is &s;ure to prevail; even where the general
<PB N="312" REF="307">
intere&s;t of the &s;y&s;tern requires not that deci&s;ion. Tho'
the reproach of here&s;y may, for &s;ome time, be ban|died
about among&s;t the di&s;putants, it always re&s;ts at
la&s;t on the &s;ide of rea&s;on. Any one it is pretended,
that has but learning enough of this kind to know the
definition of ARIAN, PELAGIAN, ERASTIAN, SO|CINIAN,
SABELLIAN, EUTYCHIAN, NESTORIAN,
MONOTHELITE, &amp;c. not to mention PROTESTANT,
who&s;e fate is yet uncertain, will be convinced of the
truth of this ob&s;ervation. And thus a &s;y&s;tem becomes
more ab&s;urd in the end, merely from its being rea&s;on|able
and philo&s;ophical in the beginning.</P>
<P>To oppo&s;e the torrent of &s;chola&s;tic religion by &s;uch
feeble maxims as the&s;e, that <HI>it is impo&s;&s;ible for the &s;ame
thing to be and not to be,</HI> that <HI>the whole is greater than
a part,</HI> that <HI>two and three make five;</HI> is pretending to

&s;ame time &s;o dogmatical with regard to religion, that
they think the &s;ame ab&s;urdities are to be &s;ound in no

to his profane &s;en&s;es nothing but a large &s;potted

of pa&s;&s;ion to a real madne&s;s or di&s;order of the brain:
Otherwi&s;e, &s;ays the hi&s;torian, he never would have
openly affronted any e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. For on
that head, continues he, every nation are be&s;t &s;ati&s;|fied
with their own, and think they have the advan|tage
over every other nation.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that the ROMAN catholics are
a very learned &s;ect; and that no one communion, but
that of the church of ENGLAND, can di&s;pute their be|ing
the mo&s;t learned of all the chri&s;tian churches: Yet
AVERROES, the famous ARABIAN, who, no doubt,
had heard of the EGYPTIAN &s;uper&s;titions, declares,
that, of all religions, the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and non-&s;en&s;ical
$ that, who&s;e votaries eat, after having created, their deity.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, indeed, that there is no tenet in all
pagani&s;m, which would give &s;o fair a &s;cope to ridicule
as this of the <HI>real pre&s;ence:</HI> For it is &s;o ab&s;urd, that it
<PB N="314" REF="309">
eludes the force of almo&s;t all argument. There are
even &s;ome plea&s;ant &s;tories of that kind, which, though
&s;omewhat profane, are commonly told by the Catho|lics
them&s;elves. One day, a prie&s;t, it is &s;aid, gave
inadvertently, in&s;tead of the &s;acrament, a counter,
which had by accident fallen among the holy wa&s;ers.
The communicant waited patiently for &s;ome time, ex|pecting
it would di&s;&s;olve on his tongue: But finding,
that it &s;till remained entire, he took it off. I <HI>wi&s;h,</HI>
cries he to the prie&s;t, <HI>you have not committed &s;ome m$&s;|take:
I wi&s;h you have not given me God the Father:
He is &s;o hard and tough there is no &s;wallowing him.</HI></P>
<P>A FAMOUS general, at that time in the MUSCO|VITE
&s;ervice, having come to PARIS for the recovery
of his wounds, brought along with him a young
TURK, whom he had taken pri&s;oner. Some of the
doctors of the SORBONNE (who are altogether as po&s;i|tive
as the dervi&s;es of CONSTANTINOPLE) thinking it
a pity, that the poor TURK &s;hould be damned &s;er
want of in&s;truction, &s;ollicited MUSTAPHA very hard
to turn Chri&s;tian, and promi&s;ed him, for his encou|ragement,
plenty of good wine in this world, and
paradi&s;e in the next. The&s;e al$urements were too
powerful to be re&s;i&s;ted; and therefore, having been
well in&s;tructed and catechized, he at la&s;t agreed to
receive the &s;acraments of bapti&s;m and the Lord's &s;up|per.
The prie&s;t, however, to make every thing &s;ure
<PB N="315" REF="310">
and &s;olid, &s;till continued his in&s;tructions; and began
his catechi&s;m the next day with the u&s;ual que&s;tion,

<HI>You have told me all along that there is but one
God: And ye&s;terday I eat him.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the doctrines of our brethren, the Catho|lics.
But to the&s;e doctrines we are &s;o accu&s;tomed,
that we never wonder at them: Though, in a future
age, it will probably become difficult to per&s;uade
&s;ome nations, that any human, two-legged creature,
could ever embrace &s;uch principles. And it is a thou|&s;and

&s;omething full as ab&s;urd in their own creed, to which

<P>I LODGED once at PARIS, in the &s;ame <HI>hotel</HI> with
an emba&s;&s;ador from TUNIS, who, having pa&s;&s;ed

One day I ob&s;erved his MOORISH excellency divert|ing

THERE occurs, I own, a difficulty in the EGYP|TIAN
&s;y&s;tem of theology; as indeed, few &s;y&s;tems are
entirely free from difficulties. It is evident, from
their method of propagation, that a couple of cats,
in fifty years, would &s;tock a whole kingdom; and if
that religious veneration were &s;till paid them, it would
$n twenty more, not only be ea&s;ier in EGYPT to find
a god than a man, which PETRONIUS &s;ays was the
$word$ in &s;ome parts of ITALY; but the gods mu&s;t at
l$$t ent$$ly &s;tarve the men, and leave them&s;elves
neither prie&s;ts nor votaries remaining. It is proba|ble,
therefore, that that wi&s;e nation, the mo&s;t $cle
$word$ in antiquity for prudence and &s;ound policy,
fore&s;eeing &s;uch dangerous con&s;equences, re&s;erved all
their wor&s;hip for the full grown divinities, and u&s;ed the
freedom to drown the holy &s;pawn or little &s;ucking gods,
without any &s;crup$e or remor&s;e. And thus the prac|tice

<P>IF ever there was a nation or a time, in which the

AUGUSTUS was tainted with &s;uper&s;tition of every
kind. As it is reported of MILTON, that his poeti|cal
genius never flowed with ea&s;e and abundance in

was al&s;o extremely unea&s;y when he happened to
change his &s;hoes, and put the right foot &s;hoe on the
left foot<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sueton. Aug. cap. 90, 91, 92. Plin. lib. ii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. In &s;hort, it cannot be doubted, but the

as numerous in every &s;tate, as tho&s;e of the modern

tho' it was not &s;o great. As many people gave
their a&s;&s;ent to it; tho' that a&s;&s;ent was not &s;eemingly
&s;o &s;trong, preci&s;e, and affirmative.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, that, notwith&s;tanding the dog|matical,
imperious &s;tyle of all &s;uper&s;tition, the con|viction
<PB N="323" REF="318">
of the religioni&s;ts, in all ages, is more affected
than real, and &s;carce ever approaches, in any degree,
to that &s;olid belief and per&s;ua&s;ion, which governs us
in the common affairs of life. Men dare not avow,
even to their own hearts, the doubts, which they en|tertain
on &s;uch &s;ubjects: They make a merit of im|plicit
faith; and di&s;gui&s;e to them&s;elves their real in|fidelity,
by the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;everations and mo&s;t po&s;i|tive
bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their en|deavours,
and &s;uffers not the ob&s;cure, glimmering
light, afforded in tho&s;e &s;hadowy regions, to equal the
&s;trong impre&s;&s;ions, made by common &s;en&s;e and by
experience. The u&s;ual cour&s;e of men's conduct be|lies
their words, and &s;hows, that the a&s;&s;ent in the&s;e
matters is &s;ome unaccountable operation of the mind
between di&s;belief and conviction, but approaching
much nearer the former than the latter.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the mind of man appears of &s;o
loo&s;e and un&s;teddy a contexture, that, even at pre|&s;ent,
when &s;o many per&s;ons find an intere&s;t in con|tinually
employing on it the chi&s;&s;el and the hammer,
yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets
with any la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion; how much more mu&s;t
this have been the ca&s;e in antient times, when the
retainers to the holy function were &s;o much fewer in
compari&s;on? No wonder, that the appearances were
then very incon&s;i&s;tent, and that men, on &s;ome occa|&s;ions,
might &s;eem determined infidels, and enemies
<PB N="324" REF="319">
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, without being &s;o in reality;
or at lea&s;t, without knowing their own minds in that
particular.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cau&s;e, which rendered the antient reli|gions
much loo&s;er than the modern, is, that the for|mer
were <HI>traditional</HI> and the latter are <HI>&s;criptural;</HI> and
the tradition in the former was complex, contradic|tory,
and, on many occa&s;ions, doubtful; &s;o that it
could not po&s;&s;ibly be reduced to any &s;tandard and
canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith.
The &s;tories of the gods were numberle&s;s like the
popi&s;h legends; and tho' every one, almo&s;t, believed
a part of the&s;e &s;tories, yet no one could believe or
know the whole: While, at the &s;ame time, all mu&s;t
have acknowledged, that no one part &s;tood on a bet|ter
foundation than the $e&s;t. The traditions of dif|ferent
cities and nations were al&s;o, on many occa&s;ions,
directly oppo&s;ite; and no rea&s;on could be found for
preferring one to the other. And as there was an
infinite number of &s;tories with regard to which tradi|tion
was no way po&s;itive; the gradation was in|&s;en&s;ible,
from the mo&s;t fundamental articles of faith,
to tho&s;e loo&s;e and precarious fictions. The pagan re|ligion,
therefore, &s;eemed to vani&s;h like a cloud, when|ever
one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal.
It could never be a&s;certained by any fixed dogmas
and principles. And tho' this did not convert the
generality of mankind from &s;o ab&s;urd a faith; for
<PB N="325" REF="320">
when will the people be rea&s;onable? yet it made
them faulter and he&s;itate more in maintaining their
principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain
di&s;po&s;itions of mind, &s;ome practices and opinions,
which had the appearance of determined infidelity.</P>
<P>TO which we may add, that the fables of the pa|gan
religion were, of them&s;elves, light, ea&s;y, and
familiar; without devils or &s;eas of brim&s;tone, or any
objects, that could much terrify the imagination.
Who could forbear &s;miling, when he thought of the
loves of MARS and VENUS, or the amorous frolics
of JUPITER and PAN? In this re&s;pect, it was a true
poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity
for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has
been adopted by modern bards; nor have the&s;e talked
with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods,
whom they regarded as fictions, than the antient did
of the real objects of their devotion.</P>
<P>THE inference is by no means ju&s;t, that becau&s;e a
&s;y&s;tem of religion has made no deep impre&s;&s;ion on
the minds of a people, it mu&s;t therefore have been
po&s;itively rejected by all men of common &s;en&s;e, and
that oppo&s;ite principles, in &s;pite of the prejudices of
education, were generally e&s;tabli&s;hed by argument
and rea&s;oning. I know not, but a contrary inference
may be more probable. The le&s;s importunate and
a&s;&s;uming any &s;pecies of &s;uper&s;tition appears, the le&s;s
<PB N="326" REF="321">
will it provoke men's &s;pleen and indignation, or en|gage

of humour, and dependent on the pre&s;ent in|cidents,
which &s;trike the imagination. The diffe|rence

<HEAD>SECT. XIII. Impious conceptions of the divine nature
in mo&s;t popular religions of both kinds.</HEAD>
<P>THE primary religion of mankind ari&s;es chiefly from
an anxious fear of future events; and what ideas will
naturally be entertained of invi&s;ible, unknown pow|ers,
while men lie under di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of any
kind, may ea&s;ily be conceived. Every image of
vengeance, &s;everity, cruelty, and malice mu&s;t occur
and mu&s;t augment the gha&s;tline&s;s and horror, which
oppre&s;&s;es the amazed religioni&s;t. A panic having
once &s;cized the mind, the active fancy &s;till farther
<PB N="333" REF="328">
multiplies the objects of terror; while that profound
darkne&s;s, or, what is wor&s;e, that glimmering light,
with which we are invironed, repre&s;ents the &s;pectres of
divinity under the mo&s;t dreadful appearances imagin|able.
And no idea of perver&s;e wickedne&s;s can be
framed, which tho&s;e terrified devotees do not readily,
without &s;cruple, apply to their deity.</P>
<P>THIS appears the natural &s;tate of religion, when
&s;urveyed in one light. But if we con&s;ider, on the
other hand, that &s;pirit of prai&s;e and eulogy, which
nece&s;&s;arily has place in all religions, and which is the
con&s;equence of the&s;e very terrors, we mu&s;t expect a
quite contrary &s;y&s;tem of theology to prevail. Every
virtue, every excellence, mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the di|vinity,
and no exaggeration be e&s;teemed &s;ufficient to
reach tho&s;e perfections, with which he is endowed.
Whatever &s;trains of panegyric can be invented, are
immediately embraced, without con&s;ulting any argu|ments
or phaenomena. And it is e&s;teemed a &s;ufficient
confirmation of them, that they give us more mag|nificent
ideas of the divine object of our wor&s;hip and
adoration.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is a kind of contradiction between
the different principles of human nature, which enter

the AFRICANS and INDIANS, nay even the JAPO|NESE,
who can form no exten&s;ive ideas of power and

<P>SUCH rude, imperfect ideas of the divinity adhere
long to all idola$ers; and it may &s;afely be affirmed,
that the GREEKS them&s;elves never got entirely rid of
them. It is remarked by XENOPHON<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mem. lib. i.</NOTE>, in prai&s;e of
SOCRATES, that that philo&s;opher a&s;&s;ented not to the
vulgar opinion, which &s;uppo&s;ed the gods to know
&s;ome things, and be ignorant of others: He main|tained
that they knew every thing; what was done,
&s;aid, or even thought. But as this was a &s;train of
philo&s;ophy<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It was con&s;idered among the antients, as a very extraordi|nary, philo&s;ophical paradox, that the pre&s;ence of the gods was not confined to the heavens, but was extended every where; as we leain from LUCIAN. <HI>Hermotimus &s;ive De &s;ectis.</HI></NOTE> much above the conception of his coun|trymen,

we need not be &s;urprized, if very frankly,
in their books and conver&s;ation, they blamed the de|ities,
whom they woir&s;hipped in their temples. It is
ob&s;ervable, that HERODOTUS in particular &s;cruples
not, in many pa&s;&s;ages, to a&s;cribe <HI>envy</HI> to the gods;
a &s;entiment, of all others, the mo&s;t &s;uitable to a mean
and devili&s;h nature. The pagan hymns however,
&s;ung in public wor&s;hip, contained nothing but epi|thets
of prai&s;e; even while the actions a&s;cribed to the
gods were the mo&s;t barbarous and dete&s;table. When
TIMOTHEUS, the poet, recited a hymn to DIANA,
where he enumerated, with the greate&s;t eulogies, all
the actions and attributes of that cruel, capricious

<P>BUT as men farther exalt their idea of their divi|nity;
it is often their notion of his power and know|ledge
only, not of his goodne&s;s, which is improved.
On the contrary, in proportion to the &s;uppo&s;ed extent
of his &s;cience and authority, their terrors naturally
augment; while they believe, that no &s;ecrecy can
conceal them from his &s;crutiny, and that even the
inmo&s;t rece&s;&s;es of their brea&s;t lie open before him.
They mu&s;t then be careful not to form expre&s;sly any
&s;entiment of blame and di&s;approbation. All mu&s;t be
<PB N="336" REF="331">
applau&s;e, ravi&s;hment, extacy. And while their
gloomy apprehen&s;ions make them a&s;cribe to him
mea&s;ures of conduct, which, in human creatures,
would be highly blamed, they mu&s;t &s;till affect to prai&s;e
and admire that conduct in the object of their devo|tional
addre&s;&s;es. Thus it may &s;afely be affirmed,
that many popular religions are really, in the concep|tion
of their more vulgar votaries, a &s;pecies of daemo|ni&s;m;
and the higher the deity is exalted in power
and knowledge, the lower of cour&s;e is he frequently
depre&s;&s;ed in goodne&s;s and benevolence; whatever
epithets of prai&s;e may be be&s;towed on him by his
amazed adorers. Among&s;t idolaters, the words may
be fal&s;e, and belie the &s;ecret opinion: But among&s;t
more exalted religioni&s;ts, the opinion it&s;elf often con|tracts
a kind of fal&s;hood, and belies the inward &s;enti|ment.
The heart &s;ecretly dete&s;ts &s;uch mea&s;ures of
cruel and implacable vengeance; but the judgment
dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable.
And the additional mi&s;ery of this inward &s;truggle ag|gravates
all the other terrors, by which the&s;e unhappy
victims to &s;uper&s;tition are for ever haunted.</P>
<P>LUCIAN<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Necyomantia.</NOTE> ob&s;erves, that a young man, who reads
the hi&s;tory of the gods in HOMER or HESIOD, and
<PB N="337" REF="332">
finds their factions, wars, inju&s;tice, ince&s;t, adul|tery,
and other immoralities &s;o highly celebrated, is
much &s;urprized afterwards, when he comes into the
world, to ob&s;erve, that puni&s;hments are by law in|flicted
on the &s;ame actions, which he had been taught
to a&s;cribe to &s;uperior beings. The contradiction is
&s;till perhaps &s;tronger betwixt the repre&s;entations given
us by &s;ome latter religions and our natural ideas of
genero&s;ity, lenity, impartiality, and ju&s;tice; and in
proportion to the multipled terrors of the&s;e religions,
the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied
upon us<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>BACCHUS, a divine being, is repre&s;ented by the heathen mythology as the inventor of dancing and the theatre. Plays were antiently, even a part of public wor&s;hip on the mo&s;t &s;olemn occa&s;ions, and often employed in times of pe&s;tilence, to appea&s;e the offended deities.

<P>BUT in order to &s;how more evidently, that it is po&s;&s;ible for a religion to repre&s;ent the divinity in &s;till a more immoral and un|amiable light than the antients, we &s;hall cite a long pa&s;&s;age from an author of ta&s;te and imagination, who was &s;urely no enemy to Chri&s;tianity. It is the chevalier RAMSAY, a writer, who had &s;o laudable an inclination to be orthodox, that his rea&s;on never found any difficulty, even in the doctrines which free-thinkers &s;cruple the mo&s;t, the trinity, incarnation, and &s;atisfaction: His humanity alone, of which he &s;eems to have had a great &s;tock, rebelled again&s;t the doctrines of eternal reprobation and prede&s;ti|nation. He expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf thus: &startq;What &s;trange ideas,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;would an Indian or a Chine&s;e philo&s;opher have of our holy religion, if they judged by the &s;chemes given of it by our mo|dern free-thinkers, and phari&s;aical doctors of all &s;ects? Ac|cording to the odious and too <HI>vulgar</HI> &s;y&s;tem of the&s;e incredulous &s;coffers and credulous &s;criblers,&endq; &startq;The God of the Jews is a mo&s;t cruel, unju&s;t, partial and fanta&s;tical being. He created, about 6000 years ago, a man and a woman, and placed them in a fine garden of ASIA, of which there are no remains. This gar|den was furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of trees, fountains, and flowers. He allowed them the u&s;e of all the fruits of this beautiful gar|den, except of one, that was planted in the mid&s;t thereof, and that had in it a &s;ecret virtue of pre&s;erving them in conti|nual health and vigour of body and mind, of exalting their na|tural powers and making them wi&s;e. The devil entered into the body of a &s;erpent, and &s;olicited the fir&s;t woman to eat of this forbidden fruit; &s;he engaged her hu&s;band to do the &s;ame. To puni&s;h this &s;light curio&s;ity and natural de&s;ire of life and knowledge, God not only threw our fir&s;t parents out of para|di&s;e, but he condemned all their po&s;terity to temporal mi&s;ery, and the greate&s;t part of them to eternal pains, though the &s;ouls of the&s;e innocent children have no more relation to that of ADAM than to tho&s;e of NERO and MAHOMET; &s;ince, according to the &s;chola&s;tic drivellers, fabuli&s;ts, and mytholo|gi&s;ts, all &s;ouls are created pure, and infu&s;ed immediately into mortal bodies, &s;o &s;oon as the foetus is formed. To accompli&s;h the barbarous, partial decree of prede&s;tination and reprobation, God abandoned all nations to darkne&s;s, idolatry and &s;uper&s;ti|tion, without any &s;aving knowledge or &s;alutary graces; unle&s;s it was one particular nation, whom he cho&s;e as his peculiar people. This cho&s;en nation was, however, the mo&s;t &s;tupid, ungrateful, rebellious, and perfidious of all nations. After God had thus kept the far greater part of all the human &s;pecies, during near 4000 years, in a reprobate &s;tate, he changed all of a &s;udden, and took a fancy for other nations, be&s;ide the JEWS. Then he &s;ent his only begotten Son to the world, under a human form, to appea&s;e his wrath, &s;atisfy his vin|dictive ju&s;tice, and die for the pardon of &s;in. Very few na|tions, however, have heard of this go&s;pel; and all the re&s;t, though left in invincible ignorance, are damned without ex|ception, or any po&s;&s;ibility of remi&s;&s;ion. The greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who have heard of it, have changed only &s;ome &s;pecula|tive notions about God, and &s;ome external forms in wor&s;hip: For, in other re&s;pects, the bulk of Chri&s;tians have continued as corrupt, as the re&s;t of mankind in their morals; yea, &s;o much the more perver&s;e and criminal, that their lights were greater. Unle&s;s it be a very &s;mall &s;elect number, all other Chri&s;tians, like the pagans, will be for ever damned; the great &s;acrifice offered up for them will become void and of no effect. God will take delight for ever in their torments and bla&s;phemies; and though he can, by one <HI>$iat,</HI> change their hearts, yet they will remain for ever unconverted and uncon|vertible, becau&s;e he will be for ever unappea&s;able and irrecon|cileable. It is true, that all this makes God odious, a hater of &s;ouls, rather than a lover of them; a cruel, vindictive tyrant, an impotent or a wrathful daemon, rather than an all|powerful, beneficent Father of &s;pirits: Yet all this is a my|&s;tery. He has &s;ecret rea&s;ons for his conduct, that are impe|netrable; and though he appears unju&s;t and barbarous, yet we mu&s;t believe the contrary, becau&s;e what is inju&s;tice, crime, cruelty, and the blacke&s;t malice in us, is in him ju&s;tice, mer|cy, and &s;overeign goodne&s;s.&endq; Thus the incredulous free-thinkers, &startq;the judaizing Chri&s;tians, and the fatali&s;tic doctors have disfigured and di&s;honoured the &s;ublime my&s;teries of our holy faith; thus, they have confounded the nature of good and evil; transformed the mo&s;t mon&s;trous pa&s;&s;ions into divine attributes, and &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the pagans in bla&s;phemy, by a&s;cribing to the eternal nature, as perfections, what makes the mo&s;t horrid crimes among&s;t men. The gro&s;&s;er pagans contented them&s;elves with divinizing lu&s;t, ince&s;t, and adultery; but the prede&s;tinarian doctors have divinized cruelty, wrath, fury, vengeance, and all the blacke&s;t vices.&endq; See the Chevalier RAMSAY's philo&s;ophical principles of natural and revealed reli|gion, Part II. p. 401.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XIV. Bad influence of mo&s;t popular religions on
morality.</HEAD>
<P>HERE I cannot forbear ob&s;erving a fact, which may
be worth the attention of tho&s;e, who make human
nature the object of their enquiry. It is certain, that,
in every religion, however &s;ublime the verbal defini|tion,
which it gives of its divinity, many of the vota|ries,
perhaps the greate&s;t number, will &s;till &s;eek the
divine favour, not by virtue and good morals, which
alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, but either
by frivolous ob&s;ervances, by intemperate zeal, by
rapturous exta&s;ies, or by the belief of my&s;terious and
ab&s;urd opinions. The lea&s;t part of the <HI>Sadder,</HI> as
well as of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in precepts of mora|lity;
and we may be a&s;&s;ured, that that part was al|ways
<PB N="342" REF="337">
the lea&s;t ob&s;erved and regarded. When the old
ROMANS were attacked with a pe&s;tilence, they never
a&s;cribed their &s;ufferings to their vices, or dreamed of
repentance and amendment. They never thought
that they were the general robbers of the world, who&s;e
ambition and avarice made de&s;olate the earth, and re|duced
opulent nations to want and beggary. They
only created a dictator<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Called Dictator clavis figendae cau&s;a. T. LIVIX I. vii. c. iii.</NOTE>, in order to drive a nail into
a door; and by that means, they thought that they
had &s;ufficiently appea&s;ed their incen&s;ed deity.</P>
<P>IN AEGINA, one faction entering into a con&s;piracy,
ba$barou&s;ly and treacherou&s;ly a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated &s;even hun|dred
of their fellow-citizens; and carried their fury &s;o
far, that, one mi&s;erable fugitive having fled to the
temple, they cut off his hands, by which he clung to
the gates, and carrying him out of holy ground, im|mediately
murdered him. <HI>By this impiety,</HI> &s;ays HE|RODOTUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. vi.</NOTE>, (not by the other many cruel a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tions)
<HI>they offended the gods, and contracted an inexpi|able
guilt.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, if we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e, what &s;eldom happens,
that a popular religion were found, in which it was
expre&s;sly declared, that nothing but morality could
<PB N="343" REF="338">
gain the divine favour; if an order of prie&s;ts were in|&s;tituted
to inculcate this opinion, in daily &s;ermons,
and with all the arts of per&s;ua&s;ion; yet &s;o inveterate
are the people's prejudices, that for want of &s;ome
other &s;uper&s;tition, they would make the very atten|dance
on the&s;e &s;ermons the e&s;&s;entials of religion, ra|ther
than place them in virtue and good morals. The
&s;ublime prologue of ZALEUCUS's laws<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">To be found in DIOD. SIC. lib. xii.</NOTE> in&s;pired not
the LOCRIANS, &s;o far as we can learn, with any &s;oun|der
notions of the mea&s;ures of acceptance with the
deity, than were familiar to the other GREEKS.</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation, then, holds univer&s;ally: But
&s;till one may be at &s;ome lo&s;s to account for it. It is
not &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that the people, every where,
degrade their deities into a &s;imilitude with them&s;elves,
and con&s;ider them merely as a &s;pecies of human crea|tures,
&s;omewhat more potent and intelligent. This
will not remove the difficulty. For there is no <HI>man</HI> &s;o
&s;tupid, as that, judging by his natural rea&s;on, he
would not e&s;teem virtue and hone&s;ty the mo&s;t valuable
qualities, which any per&s;on could po&s;&s;e&s;s. Why not
a&s;cribe the &s;ame &s;entiment to his deity? Why not
make all religion, or the chief part of it, to con&s;i&s;t in
the&s;e attainments?</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="339">
NOR is it &s;atisfactory to &s;ay, that the practice of
morality is more difficult than that of &s;uper&s;tition;
and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the
exce&s;&s;ive pennances of the <HI>Brachmans</HI> and <HI>Talapoins;</HI>
it is certain, that the <HI>Rhamadan</HI> of the TURKS, dur|ing
which the poor wretches, for many days, often
in the hotte&s;t months of the year, and in &s;ome of the
hotte&s;t chimates of the world, remain without eating
or drinking from the ri&s;ing to the &s;etting of the fun;
this <HI>R$amadan,</HI> I &s;ay, mu&s;t be more &s;evere than the
practice of any moral duty, even to the mo&s;t vicious
and depraved of mankind. The four lents of the
MUSCOVITE$, and the au&s;terities of &s;ome <HI>Roman Ca|tholics,</HI>
appear more di&s;agreeable than meekne&s;s and
benevolence. In &s;hort, all virtue, when men are re|conciled
to it by ever &s;o little practice, is agreeable:
All &s;uper&s;tition is for ever odious and burthen&s;ome.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, the following account may be received
as a true &s;olution of the difficulty. The duties which
a man performs as a friend or parent, &s;eem merely
owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be
wanting to the&s;e duties, without breaking through
all the ties of nature and morality. A &s;trong inclina|tion
may prompt him to the performance: A &s;enti|ment
of order and moral beauty joins its force to the&s;e
natural ties: And the whole man, if truly virtuous,
is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour.
<PB N="345" REF="340">
Even with regard to the virtues, which are more au|&s;tere,
and more founded on reflection, &s;uch as public
&s;pirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the mo|ral
obligation, in our apprehen&s;ion, removes all pre|tence
to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is
e&s;teemed no more than what we owe to &s;ociety and to
our&s;elves. In all this, a &s;uper&s;titious man finds no|thing,
which he has properly performed for the &s;ake
of his deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him
to the divine favour and protection. He con&s;iders
not, that the mo&s;t genuine method of &s;erving the divi|nity
is by promoting the happine&s;s of his creatures.
He &s;till looks out for &s;ome more immediate &s;ervice of
the &s;upreme being, in order to allay tho&s;e terrors,
with which he is haunted. And any practice, recom|mended
to him, which either &s;erves to no purpo&s;e in
life, or offers the &s;tronge&s;t violence to his natural in|clinations;
that practice he will the more readily em|brace,
on account of tho&s;e very circum&s;tances, which
&s;hould make him ab&s;olutely reject it. It &s;eems the
more purely religious, that it proceeds from no mix|ture
of any other motive or con&s;ideration. And if,
for its &s;ake, he &s;acrifices much of his ea&s;e and quiet,
his claim of merit appears &s;till to ri&s;e upon him, in
proportion to the zeal and devotion, which he di&s;|covers.
In re&s;toring a loan, or paying a debt, his di|vinity
is no way beholden to him; becau&s;e the&s;e acts
of ju&s;tice are what he was bound to perform, and
what many would have performed, were there no
<PB N="346" REF="341">
god in the univer&s;e. But if he fa&s;t a day, or give
him&s;elf a &s;ound whipping; this has a direct reference,
in his opinion, to the &s;ervice of God. No other mo|tive
could engage him to &s;uch au&s;terities. By the&s;e
di&s;tingui&s;hed marks of devotion, he has now acquired
the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence,
protection and &s;afety in this world, and eternal happi|ne&s;s
in the next.</P>
<P>HENCE the greate&s;t crimes have been found, in
many in&s;tances, compatible with a &s;uper&s;titious piety
and devotion: Hence it is ju&s;tly regarded as un&s;afe to
draw any certain inference in favour of a man's morals
from the fervour or &s;trictne&s;s of his religious exerci&s;es,
even though he him&s;elf believe them &s;incere. Nay,
it has been ob&s;erved, that enormities of the blacke&s;t
dye, have been rather apt to produce &s;uper&s;titious ter|rors,
and encrea&s;e the religious pa&s;&s;ion. BOMILCAR,
having formed a con&s;piracy for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating at once
the whole &s;enate of CARTHAGE, and invading the
liberties of his country, lo&s;t the opportunity, from a
continual regard to omens and prophe&s;ies. <HI>Tho&s;e who
undertake the mo&s;t criminal and mo&s;t dangerous enter|prizes
are commonly the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious;</HI> as an antient

which he never probably had dreamed of, had he re|mained
a good citizen, and obedient to the laws of
his country.</P>
<P>To which we may add, that, even after the com|mi&s;&s;ion
of crimes, there ari&s;e remor&s;es and &s;ecret hor|rors,
which give no re&s;t to the mind, but make it
have recour&s;e to religious rites and ceremonies, as
expiations of its offences. Whatever weakens or di&s;|orders
the internal frame promotes the intere&s;ts of &s;u|per&s;tition:
And nothing is more de&s;tructive to them
than a manly, &s;teddy virtue, which either pre&s;erves us
from di&s;a&s;trous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us
to bear them. During &s;uch calm &s;un&s;hine of the
mind, the&s;e &s;pectres of fal&s;e divinity never make
their appearance. On the other hand, while we
abandon our&s;elves to the natural undi&s;ciplined &s;ugge&s;|tions
of our timid and anxious hearts, every kind of
barbarity is a&s;cribed to the &s;upreme being, from the
terrors, with which we are agitated; and every kind
of caprice, from the methods which we embrace, in
order to appea&s;e him. <HI>Barbarity, caprice;</HI> the&s;e
qualities, however nominally di&s;gui&s;ed, we may uni|ver&s;ally
ob&s;erve, to form the ruling character of the
<PB N="348" REF="343">
deity, in popular religions. Even prie&s;ts, in&s;tead of
correcting the&s;e depraved ideas of mankind, have
often been found ready to fo&s;ter and encourage
them. The more tremendous the divinity is repre|&s;ented,
the more tame and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive do men be|come
to his mini&s;ters: And the more unaccountable
the mea&s;ures of acceptance required by him, the more
nece&s;&s;ary does it become to abandon our natural rea|&s;on,
and yield to their gho&s;tly guidance and direc|tion.
And thus it may be allowed, that the artifices
of men aggravate our natural infirmities and follies of
this kind, but never originally beget them. Their
root &s;trikes deeper into the mind, and &s;prings from the
e&s;&s;ential and univer&s;al properties of human nature.</P>

to which they are &s;o much familiarized; yet it &s;carce
&s;eems po&s;&s;ible, that any one of good under&s;tanding
&s;hould reject that idea, when once it is &s;ugge&s;ted to
him. A purpo&s;e, an intention, a de&s;ign is evident
in every thing; and when our comprehen&s;ion is &s;o
far enlarged as to contemplate the fir&s;t ri&s;e of this
vi&s;ible &s;y&s;tem, we mu&s;t adopt, with the &s;tronge&s;t
conviction, the idea of &s;ome intelligent cau&s;e or
author. The uniform maxims too, which prevail
<PB N="349" REF="344">
through the whole frame of the univer&s;e, naturally,
if not nece&s;&s;arily, lead us to conceive this intelli|gence
as &s;ingle and undivided, where the prejudices
of education oppo&s;e not &s;o rea&s;onable a theory.
Even the contrarieties of nature, by di&s;covering them|&s;elves
every where, become proo&s;s of &s;ome con|&s;i&s;tent
plan, and e&s;tabli&s;h one &s;ingle purpo&s;e or
intention, however inexplicable and incomprehen&s;ible.</P>
<P>GOOD and ill are univer&s;ally intermingled and
confounded; happine&s;s and mi&s;ery, wi&s;dom and
folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and en|tirely
of a piece. All advantages are attended
with di&s;advantages. An univer&s;al compen&s;ation
prevails in all conditions of being and exi&s;tence.
And it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible for us, by our mo&s;t chime|rical
wi&s;hes, to form the idea of a &s;tation or &s;itua|tion
altogether de&s;irable. The draughts of life,
according to the poet's fiction, are always mixed
from the ve&s;&s;els on each hand of JUPITER: Or
if any cup be pre&s;ented altogether pure, it is
drawn only, as the &s;ame poet tells us, from the left|handed
ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>THE more exqui&s;ite any good is, of which
a &s;mall &s;pecimen is afforded us, the &s;harper is the
evil, allied to it; and few exceptions are found to
this uniform law of nature. The mo&s;t &s;prightly wit
borders on madne&s;s; the highe&s;t effu&s;ions of joy
produce the deepe&s;t melancholy; the mo&s;t ravi&s;h|ing
<PB N="350" REF="345">
plea&s;ures are attended with the mo&s;t cruel la&s;&s;i|tude
and di&s;gu&s;t; the mo&s;t flattering hopes make
way for the &s;evere&s;t di&s;appointments. And in ge|neral,
no cour&s;e of life has &s;uch &s;afety (for hap|pine&s;s
is not to be dreamed of) as the temperate
and moderate, which maintains, as far as po&s;|&s;ible,
a mediocrity, and a kind of in&s;en&s;ibility, in
every thing.</P>
<P>As the good, the great, the &s;ublime, the ravi&s;h|ing
are found eminently in the genuine principles
of thei&s;m; it may be expected, from the analogy
of nature, that the ba&s;e, the ab&s;urd, the mean, the
terrifying will be di&s;covered equally in religious fic|tions
and chimeras.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al propen&s;ity to believe in invi&s;ible,
intelligent power, if not an original in&s;tinct, being
at lea&s;t a general attendant of human nature, may
be con&s;idered as a kind of mark or &s;tamp, which
the divine workman has &s;et upon his work; and
nothing &s;urely can more dignify mankind, than to
be thus &s;elected from all the other parts of the crea|tion,
and to bear the image or impre&s;&s;ion of the
univer&s;al Creator. But con&s;ult this image, as it
commonly appears in the popular religions of the
world. How is the deity disfigured in our repre|&s;entations
of him! What caprice, ab&s;urdity, and
immorality are attributed to him! How much is he
degraded even below the character which we &s;hould
<PB N="351" REF="346">
naturally, in common life, a&s;cribe to a man of &s;en&s;e
and virtue!</P>
<P>WHAT a noble privilege is it of human rea&s;on
to attain the knowledge of the &s;upreme Being; and,
from the vi&s;ible works of nature, be enabled to infer
&s;o &s;ublime a principle as its &s;upreme Creator? But
turn the rever&s;e of the medal. Survey mo&s;t nations
and mo&s;t ages. Examine the religious principles,
which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You
will &s;carcely be per&s;uaded, that they are other than
&s;ick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them
more as the play&s;ome whim&s;ies of monkeys in human
&s;hape, than the &s;erious, po&s;itive, dogmatical a&s;&s;eve|rations
of a being, who dignifies him&s;elf with the name
of rational.</P>
<P>HEAR the verbal prote&s;tations of all men: No|thing
they are &s;o certain of as their religious tenets.
Examine their lives: You will &s;carcely think that
they repo&s;e the &s;malle&s;t confidence in them.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t and true&s;t zeal gives us no &s;ecurity
again&s;t hypocri&s;y: The mo&s;t open impiety is attend|ed
with a &s;ecret dread and compunction.</P>
<P>No theological ab&s;urdities &s;o glaring as have not,
&s;ometimes, been embraced by men of the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t cultivated under&s;tanding. No religious
precepts &s;o rigorous as have not been adopted by
the mo&s;t voluptuous and mo&s;t abandoned of men.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="347">
IGNORANCE <HI>is the mother of Devotion:</HI> A maxim,
that is proverbial, and confirmed by general expe|rience.
Look out for a people, entirely void of re|ligion:
If you find them at all, be a&s;&s;ured, that they
are but few degrees removed from brutes.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;o pure as &s;ome of the morals, included
in &s;ome theological &s;y&s;tems? What &s;o corrupt as
&s;ome of the practices, to which the&s;e &s;y&s;tems give ri&s;e?</P>
<P>THE comfortable views, exhibited by the belief
of futurity, are ravi&s;hing and delightful. But how
quickly vani&s;h, on the appearance of its terrors,
which keep a more firm and durable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
human mind?</P>
<P>THE whole is a riddle, an aenigma, an inexpli|cable
my&s;tery. Doubt, uncertainty, &s;u&s;pence of
judgment appear the only re&s;ult of our mo&s;t ac|curate
&s;crutiny, concerning this &s;ubject. But &s;uch
is the frailty of human rea&s;on, and &s;uch the irre&s;i&s;|tible
contagion of opinion, that even this delibe|rate
doubt could &s;carce be upheld; did we not
enlarge our view, and oppo&s;ing one &s;pecies of &s;uper|&s;tition
to another, &s;et them a quarrelling; while we
our&s;elves, during their fury and contention, happily
make our e&s;cape, into the calm, though ob&s;cure, re|gions
of philo&s;ophy.</P>
