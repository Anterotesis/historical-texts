<HEAD>PROLOGUE, SPOKEN by Mr. FOOTE.</HEAD>
<L>OF all the Passions that possess Mankind,</L>
<L>The Love of Novelty rules most the Mind,</L>
<L>In search of this from Realm to Realm we roam,</L>
<L>Our Fleets come fraught with every Folly home.</L>
<L>From Lybias Desarts hostile Brutes advance,</L>
<L>And dancing Dogs in Droves skip here from France.</L>
<L>From Latian Lands Gigantic Forms appear,</L>
<L>Striking our British Breasts with Awe and Fear,</L>
<L>As once the Liliputians — Gulliver,</L>
<L>Not only Objects that affect the Sight,</L>
<L>In foreign Arts and Artists we delight,</L>
<L>Near to that Spot where Charles bestrides a Horse,</L>
<L>In humble Prose the Place is Charing Cross;</L>
<L>Close by the Margin of a Kennels Side,</L>
<L>A dirty dismal Entry opens wide,</L>
<L>There with hoarse Voice, check'd Shirt and callous Hand</L>
<L><HI>Duffs</HI> Indian English Trader takes his Stand,</L>
<L>Surveys each Passenger with curious Eyes,</L>
<L>And rustic <HI>Roger</HI> falls an easy Prise,</L>
<L>Here's China Porcelaine that Chelsea yields,</L>
<L>And India Handkerchiefs from Spittalfields,</L>
<L><PB REF="3"/>With Turkey Carpets that from <HI>Wilton</HI> came,</L>
<L>And Spanish Tucks and Blades from <HI>Bermingham</HI>.</L>
<L>Factors are forc'd to favour this Deceit,</L>
<L>And English Goods are smuggl'd through the Street.</L>
<L>The Rude to polish and the Fair to please,</L>
<L>The Hero of to Night has cross'd the Seas,</L>
<L>Tho' to be born a <HI>Briton</HI> be his Crime,</L>
<L>He's manufactur'd in another Clime.</L>
<L>'Tis <HI>Buck</HI> begs Leave once more to come before ye,</L>
<L>The little Subject of a former Story,</L>
<L>How chang'd, how fashion'd whether Brute or Beau,</L>
<L>We trust the following Scenes will fully shew.</L>
<L>For them and him we your Indulgence crave,</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE, Spoken by M<SUP>rs.</SUP> BELLAMY.</HEAD>
<L>AMONG the Arts to make a Piece go down,</L>
<L>And fix the fickle Favour of the Town,</L>
<L>An <HI>Epilogue</HI> is deem'd the surest Way</L>
<L>To attone for all the Errors of the Play:</L>
<L>Thus, when pathetic Strains have made you cry,</L>
<L>In trips the Comic Muse, and wipes your Eye.</L>
<L>With equal Reason, when she has made you laugh,</L>
<L><HI>Melpomene</HI> shou'd send you sniveling off;</L>
<L>But our Bard, unequal to the Task,</L>
<L>Rejects the Dagger, and retains the Masque:</L>
<L>Fain would he send you chearful home to Night,</L>
<L>And harmless Mirth by honest Means excite;</L>
<L>Scorning with luscious Phrase or double Sense,</L>
<L>To raise a Laughter at the Fair's Expence.</L>
<L>What Method shall we choose your Taste to hit?</L>
<L>Will no one lend our Bard a little Wit?</L>
<L>Thank ye, kind Souls, I'll take it from the Pit.</L>
<L>The Piece concluded, and the Curtain down,</L>
<L>Up starts that fatal <HI>Phalanx</HI>, call'd the <HI>Town:</HI></L>
<L>In full Assembly weigh our Author's Fate,</L>
<L>And <HI>Surly</HI> thus commences the Debate:</L>
<L>Pray, among Friends, does not this poisoning Scene</L>
<L>The sacred Rights of Tragedy prophane?</L>
<L>If Farce may mimic thus her awful Bowl:</L>
<L>Oh fie, all wrong, stark nought, upon my Soul!</L>
<L>Then <HI>Buck</HI> cries, <HI>Billy</HI>, can it be in Nature?</L>
<L>Not the least Likeness in a single Feature.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>My Lord, Lord love him, 'tis a precious Piece;</L>
<L>Let's come on <HI>Friday</HI> Night and have a Hiss.</L>
<L>To this a Peruquier assents with Joy,</L>
<L>Parcequ'il affronte les Francçois, oui, ma foi.</L>
<L>In such Distress what can the Poet do?</L>
<L>Where seek for Shelter when these Foes pursue?</L>
<L>He dares demand Protection, Sirs, from you.</L>

<P>A good, pretty Legacy! Let's see; I find my∣self Heir, by this generous Devise of my very good Friend, to ten Actions at Common Law, nine Suits in Chancery, the Conduct of a Boy, bred a Booby at Home, and finish'd a Fop abroad; together with the Direction of a mar∣riageable, and, therefore, an unmanageable Wench; and all this to an old Fellow of Six∣ty-six, who heartily hates Bus'ness, is tir'd of the World, and despises every Thing in it.

<P>I wou'd, Mr. <HI>Crab</HI>, have attended your Summons immediately, but I was ob∣lig'd to sign Judgment, in Error at the Com∣mon Pleas; sue out of the Exchequer a Writ of <HI>Quae minus</HI>, and surrender in <HI>Banco Regis</HI> the Defendant, before the Return of the <HI>Sci fa</HI>, to discharge the Bail.</P>

<P>Zounds, Sir, I never thought about a Lawyer. The Law is an oracular Idol, you are the explanatory Ministers; nor shou'd any of my own private Concerns have made me bow to your beastly <HI>Baal</HI>. I had rather lose a Cause, than contest it.

<P>So, Youngster! what, I suppose, you are already practising one of your foreign Les∣sons. Perverting the Affections of a Friend's Mistress, or debauching his Wife, are meer Peccadilloes, in modern Morality. But, at pre∣sent, you are my Care. That Way conducts you to your Fellow-Travellor. <STAGE><HI>Exit</HI> Ld. J.</STAGE> I wou'd speak with you in the Library.</P>

<P>I shall attend you, Sir. Never was so unhappy an Interruption. What cou'd my Lord mean? But be it what it will, it ought not, it cannot concern me. Gratitude and Duty demand my Compliance with the dying Wish of my Benefactor, my Friend, my Father. But am I then to sacrifice all my future Peace? But reason not, rash Girl; Obedience is thy Province.</P>
<Q><L>Tho' hard the Task be, it's my Part to prove</L>
<L>That sometimes Duty can give Laws to Love.</L></Q>
