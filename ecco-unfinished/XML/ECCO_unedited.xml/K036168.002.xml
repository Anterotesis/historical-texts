<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE greatest part of mankind may be divided
into two classes; that of <HI>shallow</HI> thinkers,
who fall short of the truth; and that of <HI>ab∣struse</HI>
thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter class are
by far the most uncommon; and I may add, by far
the most useful and valuable. They suggest hints, at
least, and start difficulties, which they want, perhaps,
skill to pursue; but which may produce very fine dis∣coveries,
when handled by men who have a more just
way of thinking. At worst, what they say is un∣common;
and if it should cost some pains to compre∣hend
it, one has, however, the pleasure of hearing
something that is new. An author is little to be va∣lued,
who tells us nothing but what we can learn from
every coffee-house conversation.</P>
<P>ALL people of <HI>shallow</HI> thought are apt to decry even
those of <HI>solid</HI> understanding, as <HI>abstruse</HI> thinkers, and
metaphysicians, and refiners; and never will allow
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak
conceptions. There are some cases, I own, where
an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presump∣tion
of falsehood, and where no reasoning is to be
trusted out what is natural and easy. When a man
deliberates concerning his conduct in any <HI>particular</HI>
affair, and forms schemes in politics, trade, oecono∣my,
or any business in life, he never ought to draw
his arguments too fine, or connect too long a chain of
consequences together. Something is sure to happen,
that will disconcert his reasoning, and produce an
event different from what he expected. But when
we reason upon <HI>general</HI> subjects, one may justly affirm,
that our speculations can scarce ever be too fine,
provided they be just; and that the difference be∣tween
a common man and a man of genius is chiefly
seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles up∣on
which they proceed. General reasonings seem in∣tricate,
merely because they are general; nor is it
easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish, in a great
number of particulars, that common circumstance in
which they all agree, or to extract it, pure and un∣mixed,
from the other superfluous circumstances.
Every judgment or conclusion, with them, is parti∣cular.
They cannot enlarge their view to those uni∣versal
propositions, which comprehend under them an
infinite number of individuals, and include a whole
science in a single theorem. Their eye is confounded
with such an extensive prospect; and the conclusions
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
derived from it, even tho' clearly expressed, seem in∣tricate
and obscure. But however intricate they may
seem, 'tis certain, that general principles, if just and
sound, must always prevail in the general course of
things, tho' they may fail in particular cases; and
'tis the chief business of philosophers to regard the
general course of things. I may add, that 'tis also
the chief business of politicians; especially in the do∣mestic
government of the state, where the public
good, which is, or ought to be their object, depends
on the concurrence of a multitude of cases; not,
as in foreign politics, on accidents, and chances,
and the caprices of a few persons. This therefore
makes the difference betwixt <HI>particular</HI> deliberations
and <HI>general</HI> reasonings, and renders subtilty and re∣finement
much more suitable to the latter than to the
former.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this introduction necessary before the
following discourses on <HI>commerce, money, interest, balance
of trade, &amp;c.</HI> where, perhaps, there will occur some prin∣ciples
which are uncommon, and which may seem too
refined and subtile for such vulgar subjects. If false,
let them be rejected: But no one ought to entertain a
prejudice against them, merely because they are out
of the common road.</P>
<P>THE greatness of a state, and the happiness of its
subjects, however independent they may be supposed
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
in some respects, are commonly allowed to be insepa∣rable
with regard to commerce; and as private men
receive greater security, in the possession of their trade
and riches, from the power of the public, so the pub∣lic
becomes powerful in proportion to the riches and
extensive commerce of private men. This maxim is
true in general; tho' I cannot forbear thinking, that
it may possibly admit of some exceptions, and that
we often establish it with too little reserve and limi∣tation.
There may be some circumstances, where the
commerce, and riches, and luxury of individuals, in∣stead
of adding strength to the public, will serve only
to thin its armies, and diminish its authority among
the neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable be∣ing,
and susceptible of many different opinions, prin∣ciples,
and rules of conduct. What may be true
while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be
found false when he has embraced an opposite set of
manners and opinions.</P>
<P>THE bulk of every state may be divided into <HI>hus∣bandmen</HI>
and <HI>manufacturers.</HI> The former are employed
in the culture of the land: The latter work up the
materials furnished by the former, into all the com∣modities
which are necessary or ornamental to human
life. As soon as men quit their savage state, where
they live chiefly by hunting and fishing, they must
fall into these two classes; tho' the arts of agriculture
employ <HI>at first</HI> the most numerous part of the so∣ciety<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mons. MELON in his political essay on commerce asserts, that even at present, if you divide FRANCE into 20 parts, 16 are labourers or peasants; 2 only artizans; one belonging to the law, church, and military; and one merchants, financiers, and bourgeois. This calculation is certainly very erroneous. In FRANCE, ENGLAND, and indeed most parts of EUROPE, half of the inhabitants live in cities; and even of those who live in the country, a very great number are artisans, perhaps above a third.</NOTE>.
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
Time and experience improve so much these
arts, that the land may easily maintain a much greater
number of men, than those who are immediately
employed in its cultivation, or who furnish the more
necessary manufactures to such as are so employed.</P>
<P>IF these superfluous hands apply themselves to the
finer arts, which are commonly denominated the arts
of <HI>luxury,</HI> they add to the happiness of the state;
since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving
enjoyments, with which they would otherwise have
been unacquainted. But may not another scheme be
proposed for the employment of these superfluous
hands? May not the sovereign lay claim to them,
and employ them in fleets and armies, to increase
the dominions of the state abroad, and spread its
fame over distant nations? 'Tis certain, that the fewer
desires and wants are found in the proprietors and la∣bourers
of land, the fewer hands do they employ;
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
and consequently the superfluities of the land, instead
of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers, may
support fleets and armies to a much greater extent,
than where a great many arts are required to mini∣ster
to the luxury of particular persons. Here there∣fore
seems to be a kind of opposition between the
greatness of the state and the happiness of the sub∣jects.
A state is never greater than when all its su∣perfluous
hands are employed in the service of the
public. The ease and convenience of private persons
require, that these hands should be employed in their
service. The one can never be satisfied, but at the
expence of the other. As the ambition of the sove∣reign
must entrench on the luxury of individuals; so
the luxury of individuals must diminish the force,
and check the ambition of the sovereign.</P>
<P>NOR is this reasoning merely chimerical; but is
founded on history and experience. The republic of
SPARTA was certainly more powerful than any state now
in the world, consisting of an equal number of people:
and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce
and luxury. The HELOTES were the labourers: The
SPARTANS were the soldiers or gentlemen. 'Tis evi∣dent,
that the labour of the HELOTES could not have
maintained so great a number of SPARTANS, had
these latter lived in case and delicacy, and given em∣ployment
to a great variety of trades and manufac∣tures.
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
The like policy may be remarked in ROME.
And indeed, thro' all antient history, 'tis observable,
that the smallest republics raised and maintained great∣er
armies, than states consisting of triple the number
of inhabitants, are able to support at present. 'Tis
computed, that, in all EUROPEAN nations, the pro∣portion
between soldiers and people does not exceed
one to a hundred. But we read, that the city of
ROME alone, with its small territory, raised and
maintained, in early times, ten legions against the
LATINS. ATHENS, whose whole dominions were
not larger than YORKSHIRE, sent to the expedition
against SICILY near forty thousand men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THUCYDIDES, lib. 7.</NOTE>. DIONY∣SIUS
the elder, 'tis said, maintained a standing army
of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse,
beside a large fleet of four hundred sail<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 2. This account, I own, is somewhat suspicious, not to say worse; chiefly because this army was not composed of citizens, but of mercenary forces.</NOTE>; tho' his
territories extended no farther than the city of SYRA∣CUSE,
about a third part of the island of SICILY, and
some sea-port towns or garrisons on the coast of ITA∣LY
and ILLYRICUM. 'Tis true, the antient armies,
in time of war, subsisted much upon plunder: But
did not the enemy plunder in their turn? which was
a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than any other
that could be devised. In short, no probable reason
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
can be assigned for the great power of the more antient
states above the modern, but their want of commerce
and luxury. Few artisans were maintained by the
labour of the farmers, and therefore more soldiers
might live upon it. TITUS LIVIUS says, that ROME,
in his time, would find it difficult to raise as large an
army as that which, in her early days, she sent out
against the GAULS and LATINS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII, lib. 7. cap. 24. “Adeo in quae laboramus,” says he, “sola crevimus, divitias luxuriemque.”</NOTE>. Instead of those
soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in CA∣MILLUS'S
time, there were in AUGUSTUS'S days, mu∣sicians,
painters, cooks, players, and tailors; and if
the land was equally cultivated at both periods, 'tis
evident it could maintain equal numbers in the one
profession as in the other. They added nothing to
the mere necessaries of life, in the latter period more
than in the former.</P>
<P>'TIS natural on this occasion to ask, whether sove∣reigns
may not return to the maxims of antient po∣licy,
and consult their own interest, in this respect,
more than the happiness of their subjects? I answer,
that it appears to me almost impossible; and that be∣cause
antient policy was violent, and contrary to the
more natural and usual course of things. 'Tis well
known with what peculiar laws SPARTA was govern∣ed,
<PB N="11" REF="14"/>
and what a prodigy that republic is justly esteemed
by every one, who has considered human nature, as
it has displayed itself on other nations, and other
ages. Were the testimony of history less positive and
circumstantial, such a government would appear a
mere philosophical whim or fiction, and impossible
ever to be reduced to practice. And tho' the ROMAN
and other antient republics were supported on prin∣ciples
somewhat more natural, yet was there a very
extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make
them submit to such grievous burthens. They were
free states; they were small ones; and the age being
martial, all the neighbouring states were continually
in arms. Freedom naturally begets public spirit, espe∣cially
in small states; and this public spirit, this <HI>amor
patriae,</HI> must increase, when the public is almost in
continual alarm, and men are obliged, every mo∣ment,
to expose themselves to the greatest dangers
for its defence. A continual succession of wars makes
every citizen a soldier: He takes the field in his turn;
and during his service is chiefly maintained by himself.
And, notwithstanding that his service is equivalent to
a very severe tax, 'tis less felt by a people addicted
to arms, who fight for honour and revenge more than
pay, and are unacquainted with gain and industry as
well as pleasure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The more antient ROMANS lived in perpetual war with all their neighbours: and in old LATIN, the term, <HI>hostis,</HI> expressed both a stranger and an enemy. This is remarked by CICERO; but by him is ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors, who softened, as much as possible, the denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the same appellation which signified a stranger. <HI>De Off.</HI> lib. 2. 'Tis however much more probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of those people was so great as to make them regard all strangers as enemies, and call them by the same name. It is not, besides, consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of nature, that any state should regard its public enemies with a friendly eye, or preserve any such sentiments for them as the ROMAN orator would afcribe to his ancestors. Not to mention, that the early ROMANS re∣ally exercised piracy, as we learn from their first treaties with CARTHAGE, preserved by POLYBIUS, lib. 3. and consequently like the SALLEE and ALGERINE rovers, were actually at war with most nations, and a stranger and an enemy were with them almost synonymous.</NOTE>. Not to mention the great equa∣lity
<PB N="12" REF="15"/>
of fortunes amongst the inhabitants of the antient
republics, where every field belonging to a different
proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and ren∣dered
the numbers of citizens very considerable, even
without trade and manufactures.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the want of trade and manufactures,
amongst a free and very martial people, may <HI>sometimes</HI>
have no other effect than to render the public more
powerful, 'tis certain, that in the common course of
human affairs, it will have a quite contrary tendency.
Sovereigns must take mankind as they find them, and
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in
their principles and ways of thinking. A long course
of time, with a variety of accidents and circumstances,
are requisite to produce those great revolutions, which
so much diversify the face of human affairs. And
the less natural any set of principles are, which sup∣port
a particular society, the more difficult will a le∣gislator
meet with in raising and cultivating them.
'Tis his best policy to comply with the common bent
of mankind, and give it all the improvements of
which it is susceptible. Now, according to the most
natural course of things, industry, and arts, and trade
increase the power of the sovereign as well as the
happiness of the subjects; and that policy is violent,
which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of indi∣viduals.
This will easily appear from a few conside∣rations,
which will present to us the consequences of
sloth and barbarity.</P>
<P>WHERE manufactures and mechanic arts are not
cultivated, the bulk of the people must apply them∣selves
to agriculture; and if their skill and industry
increase, there must arise a great superfluity from their
labour beyond what suffices to maintain them. They
have no temptation, therefore, to increase their skill
and industry; fince they cannot exchange that super∣fluity
for any commodities, which may serve either
to their pleasure or vanity. A habit of indolence
naturally prevails. The greater part of the land lies
<PB N="14" REF="17"/>
uncultivated. What is cultivated, yields not its ut∣most,
for want of skill or assiduity in the farmers. If
at any time the public exigencies require, that great
numbers should be employed in the public service,
the labour of the people furnishes now no superflui∣ties,
by which these numbers can be maintained. The
labourers cannot increase their skill and industry on a
sudden. Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into
tillage for some years. The armies, mean while,
must either make sudden and violent conquests, or
disband for want of subsistence. A regular attack or
defence, therefore, is not to be expected from such
a people, and their soldiers must be as ignorant and
unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers.</P>
<P>EVERY thing in the world is purchased by labour;
and our passions are the only causes of labour. When
a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts,
the proprietors of land, as well as the farmers, study
agriculture as a science, and redouble their industry
and attention. The superfluity which arises from
their labour, is not lost; but is exchanged with the
manufacturers for those commodities which means lux∣ury
now makes them covet. By this means, land
furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life,
than what suffices for those who cultivate it. In times
of peace and tranquility, this superfluity goes to the
maintenance of manufacturers, and the improvers of
liberal arts. But 'tis easy for the public to convert
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
many of these manufacturers into soldiers, and main∣tain
them by that superfluity, which arises from the
labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that
this is the case in all civilized governments. When
the sovereign raises an army, what is the consequence?
He imposes a tax. This tax obliges all the people
to retrench what is least necessary to their subsistence.
Those who labour in such commodities, must either
enlist in the troops, or turn themselves to agriculture,
and thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want
of business. And to consider the matter abstractly,
manufactures increase the power of the state only as
they store up so much labour, and that of a kind to
which the public may lay claim, without depriving
any one of the necessaries of life. The more labour,
therefore, is employed beyond mere necessaries, the
more powerful is any state; since the persons en∣gaged
in that labour may easily be converted to the
public service. In a state without manufactures, there
may be the same number of hands; but there is not
the same quantity of labour, nor of the same kind.
All the labour is there bestowed upon necessaries,
which can admit of little or no abatement.</P>
<P>THUS the greatness of the sovereign and the hap∣piness
of the state are, in a great measure, united
with regard to trade and manufactures. 'Tis a vio∣lent
method, and in most cases impracticable, to oblige
the labourer to toil, in order to raise from the land
more than what subsists himself and family. Furnish
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
him with manufactures and commodities, and he will
do it of himself. Afterwards you will find it easy to
seize some part of his superfluous labour, and employ
it in the public service, without giving him his wonted
return. Being accustomed to industry, he will think
this less grievous, than if, at once, you obliged him to
an augmentation of labour without any reward. The
case is the same with regard to the other members of
the state. The greater is the stock of labour of all
kinds, the greater quantity may be taken from the
heap, without making any sensible alteration upon it.</P>
<P>A PUBLIC granary of corn, a storehouse of cloth,
a magazine of arms; all these must be allowed real
riches and strength in any state. Trade and industry
are really nothing but a stock of labour, which, in
time of peace and tranquility, is employed for the
ease and satisfaction of individuals; but in the exigen∣cies
of state, may, in part, be turned to public ad∣vantage.
Could we convert a city into a kind of for∣tified
camp, and infuse into each breast so martial a
genius, and such a passion for public good, as to
make every one willing to undergo the greatest hard∣ships
for the sake of the public; these affections might
now, as in antient times, prove alone a sufficient spur
to industry, and support the community. It would
then be advantageous, as in camps, to banish all arts
and luxury; and, by restrictions on equipage and
tables, make the provisions and forage last longer than
if the army were loaded with a number of superflu∣ous
<PB N="17" REF="20"/>
retainers. But as these principles are too disinte∣rested
and too difficult to support, 'tis requisite to
govern men by other passions, and animate them with
a spirit of avarice and industry, art and luxury. The
camp is, in this case, loaded with a superfluous reti∣nue;
but the provisions flow in proportionably larger.
The harmony of the whole is still supported; and
the natural bent of the mind being more complied
with, individuals, as well as the public, find their
account in the observance of those maxims.</P>
<P>THE same method of reasoning will let us see the
advantage of <HI>foreign</HI> commerce, in augmenting the
power of the state, as well as the riches and happi∣ness
of the subjects. It increases the stock of labour
in the nation; and the sovereign may convert what
share of it he finds necessary to the service of the pub∣lic.
Foreign trade, by its imports, furnishes mate∣rials
for new manufactures; and by its exports, it
produces labour in particular commodities, which
could not be consumed at home. In short, a king∣dom,
that has a large import and export, must abound
more with industry, and that employed upon delica∣cies
and luxuries, than a kingdom which rests content∣ed
with its native commodities. It is, therefore, more
powerful, as well as richer and happier. The indivi∣duals
reap the benefit of these commodities, so far
as they gratify the senses and appetites. And the pub∣lic
is also a gainer, while a greater stock of labour is,
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
by this means, stored up against any public exigency;
that is, a greater number of laborious men are main∣tained,
who may be diverted to the public service,
without robbing any one of the necessaries, or even
the chief conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>IF we consult history, we shall find, that in most
nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in
home manufactures, and given birth to domestic lux∣ury.
The temptation is stronger to make use of fo∣reign
commodities, which are ready for use, and which
are entirely new to us, than to make improvements
on any domestic commodity, which always advance by
slow degrees, and never affect us by their novelty,
The profit is also very great, in exporting what is
superfluous at home, and what bears no price, to fo∣reign
nations, whose soil or climate is not favourable
to that commodity. Thus men become acquainted
with the <HI>pleasures</HI> of luxury and the <HI>profits</HI> of com∣merce;
and their <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>industry,</HI> being once
awakened, carry them to farther improvements, in
every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade.
And this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises
from a commerce with strangers. It rouses men
from their indolence; and presenting the gayer and
more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury,
which they never before dreamed of, raises in them a
desire of a more splendid way of life than what their
ancestors enjoyed. And at the same time, the few
<PB N="19" REF="22"/>
merchants, who possess the secret of this importation
and exportation, make exorbitant profits; and becom∣ing
rivals in wealth to the antient nobility, tempt other
adventurers to become their rivals in commerce. Imi∣tation
soon diffuses all those arts; while domestic ma∣nufacturers
emulate the foreign in their improvements,
and work up every home commodity to the utmost
perfection of which it is susceptible. Their own steel
and iron, in such laborious hands, become equal to
the gold and rubies of the INDIES.</P>
<P>WHEN the affairs of the society are once brought
to this situation, a nation may lose most of its foreign
trade, and yet continue a great and powerful people.
If strangers will not take any particular commodity of
ours, we must cease to labour in it. The same hands
will turn themselves towards some refinement in other
commodities, which may be wanted at home. And
there must always be materials for them to work up∣on;
till every person in the state, who possesses riches,
enjoys as great plenty of home commodities, and
those in as great perfection, as he desires; which can
never possibly happen. CHINA is represented as one
of the most flourishing empires in the world; tho' it
has very little commerce beyond its own territories.</P>
<P>IT will not, I hope, be considered as a superfluous
digression, if I here observe, that as the multitude of
mechanical arts is advantageous, so is the great num∣ber
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
of persons to whose share the productions of these
arts fall. A too great disproportion among the citi∣zens
weakens any state. Every person, if possible,
ought to enjoy the fruits of his labour, in a full pos∣session
of all the necessaries, and many of the conve∣nience
of life. No one can doubt, but such an equa∣lity
is most suitable to human nature, and diminishes
much less from the <HI>happiness</HI> of the rich than it adds
to that of the poor. If also augments the <HI>power of
the state,</HI> and makes any extraordinary taxes or impo∣sitions
be paid with much more chearfulness. Where
the riches are engrossed by a few, these must contri∣bute
very largely to the supplying the public neces∣sities.
But when the riches are dispersed among mul∣titudes,
the burthen feels light on every shoulder,
and the taxes make not a very sensible difference on
any one's way of living.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that where the riches are in few hands,
these must enjoy all the power, and will readily con∣spire
to lay the whole burthen on the poor, and op∣press
them still farther, to the discouragement of all
industry.</P>
<P>IN this circumstance consists the great advantage of
ENGLAND above any nation at present in the world,
or that appears in the records of any story. 'Tis true,
the ENGLISH feel some disadvantages in foreign trade
by the high price of labour, which is in part the ef∣fect
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
of the riches of their artisans, as well as of the
plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the
most material circumstance, 'tis not to be put in com∣petition
with the happiness of so many millions. And
if there were no more to endear to them that free
government under which they live, this alone were
sufficient. The poverty of the common people is a
natural, if not an infallible effect of absolute mo∣narchy;
tho' I doubt, whether it be always true,
on the other hand, that their riches are an infallible
result of liberty. Liberty must be attended with par∣ticular
accidents, and a certain turn of thinking, in
order to produce that effect. Lord BACON, account∣ing
for the great advantages obtained by the ENGLISH
in their wars with FRANCE, ascribes them chiefly
to the superior ease and plenty of the common peo∣ple
amongst the former; yet the governments of the
two kingdoms were, at that time, pretty much alike.
Where the labourers and artizans are accustomed to
work for low wages, and to a retain but a small part
of the fruits of their labour, 'tis difficult for them,
even in a free government, to better their condition,
or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages.
But even where they are accustomed to a more plen∣tiful
way of life, 'tis easy for the rich, in a despotic
government, to conspire against <HI>them,</HI> and throw the
whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25"/>
IT may seem an odd position, that the poverty of
the common people in FRANCE, ITALY, and SPAIN,
is, in some measure, owing to the superior riches of
the soil and happiness of the climate; and yet there
want not many reasons to justify this paradox. In
such a fine mold or soil as that of those more southern
regions, agriculture is an easy art; and one man,
with a couple of sorry horses, will be able, in a sea∣son,
to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty
considerable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which
the farmer knows, is to leave his ground fallow for a
year, so soon as it is exhausted; and the warmth of
the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich
it, and restore its fertility. Such poor peasants, there∣fore,
require only a simple maintenance for their la∣bour.
They have no stock nor riches, which claim
more; and at the same time, they are for ever depen∣dant
on their landlord, who gives no leases, nor fears
that his land will be spoiled by the ill methods of cul∣tivation.
In ENGLAND, the land is rich, but coarse;
must be cultivated at a great expence; and produces
slender crops, when not carefully managed, and by a
method which gives not the full profit but in a course
of several years. A farmer, therefore, in ENGLAND
must have a considerable stock and a long lease; which
beget proportional profits. The fine vineyards of
CHAMPAGNE and BURGUNDY, that oft yield to the
landlord above five pounds <HI>per</HI> acre, are cultivated by
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
peasants, who have scarce bread: And the reason is, that
such peasants need no stock but their own limbs, with
instruments of husbandry, which they can buy for
twenty shillings. The farmers are commonly in some
better circumstances in those countries. But the gra∣siers
are most at their ease of all those who cultivate
the land. The reason is still the same. Men must
have profits proportionable to their expence and ha∣zard.
Where so considerable a number of the labour∣ing
poor as the peasants and farmers are in very
low circumstances, all the rest must partake of their
poverty, whether the government of that nation be
monarchical or republican.</P>
<P>WE may form a similar remark with regard to the
general history of mankind. What is the reason,
why no people living between the tropics could ever
yet attain to any art or civility, or reach even any
police in their government, and any military discip∣line;
while few nations in the temperate climates
have been altogether deprived of these advantages?
'Tis probable, that one cause of this phaenomenon
is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid
zone, which render cloaths and houses less requisite
for the inhabitants, and thereby remove, in part,
that necessity, which is the great spur to industry and
invention. <HI>Curis acuens mortalia corda:</HI> Not to men∣tion,
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind
any people enjoy, the fewer quarrels are likely to
arise amongst them, and the less necessity will there
be for a settled police or regular authority to protect
and defend them from foreign enemies, or from each
other.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of REFINEMENT in the ARTS.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY is a word of a very uncertain signifi∣cation,
and may be taken in a good as well as a
bad sense. In general, it means great refinement in
the gratification of the senses; and any degree of it
may be innocent or blameable, according to the age,
or country, or condition of the person. The bounds
between the virtue and the vice cannot here be fixed
exactly, more than in other moral subjects. To ima∣gine,
that the gratifying any of the senses, or the in∣dulging
any delicacy in meats, drinks, or apparel, is
of itself a vice, can never enter into a head, that is
not disordered by the frenzies of enthusiasm. I have,
indeed, heard of a monk abroad, who, because the
windows of his cell opened upon a very noble pro∣spect,
made a <HI>covenant with his eyes</HI> never to turn that
way, or receive so sensual a gratification. And such
is the crime of drinking CHAMPAGNE or BUR∣GUNDY,
preserably to small beer or porter. These
indulgences are only vices, when they are pursued at
<PB N="26" REF="29"/>
the expence of some virtue, as liberality or charity;
in like manner as they are follies, when for them a
man ruins his fortune, and reduces himself to want
and beggary. Where they entrench upon no virtue,
but leave ample subject whence to provide for friends,
family, and every proper object of generosity or com∣passion,
they are intirely innocent, and have in every
age been acknowledged such by almost all moralists.
To be intirely occupied with the luxury of the table,
for instance, without any relish for the pleasures of
ambition, study, or conversation, is a mark of gross
stupidity, and is incompatible with any vigour of
temper or genius. To confine one's expence intirely
to such a gratification, without regard to friends or fa∣mily,
is an indication of a heart intirely devoid of
humanity or benevolence. But if a man reserve time
sufficient for all laudable pursuits, and money sufficient
for all generous purposes, he is free from every sha∣dow
of blame or reproach.</P>
<P>SINCE luxury may be considered either as innocent
or blameable, one may be surprized at those prepos∣terous
opinions which have been entertained concern∣ing
it; while men of libertine principles bestow
praises even on vicious luxury, and represent it as
highly advantageous to society; and on the other
hand, men of severe morals blame even the most in∣nocent
luxury, and represent it as the source of all
the corruptions, disorders, and factions, incident to
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
civil government. We shall here endeavour to cor∣rect
both these extremes, by proving, <HI>first,</HI> that the
ages of refinement are both the happiest and most vir∣tuous;
<HI>secondly,</HI> that where-ever luxury ceases to be
innocent, it also ceases to be beneficial; and when
carried a degree too far, is a quality pernicious, tho'
perhaps not the most pernicious, to political society.</P>
<P>To prove the first point, we need but consider the
effects of refinement both on <HI>private</HI> and on <HI>public</HI>
life. Human happiness, according to the most re∣ceived
notions, seems to consist in three ingredients;
action, pleasure, and indolence: And tho' these in∣gredients
ought to be mixed in different proportions,
according to the particular dispositions of the person;
yet no one ingredient can be intirely wanting, with∣out
destroying, in some measure, the relish of the
whole composition. Indolence or repose, indeed,
seems not of itself to contribute much to our enjoy∣ment;
but, like sleep, is requisite as an indulgence
to the weakness of human nature, which cannot sup∣port
an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure.
That quick march of the spirits, which takes a man
from himself, and chiefly gives satisfaction, does in
the end exhaust the mind, and requires some intervals
of repose, which, tho' agreeable for a moment, yet,
if prolonged, beget a languor and lethargy, that de∣stroy
all enjoyment. Education, custom, and exam∣ple,
have a mighty influence in turning the mind to
<PB N="28" REF="31"/>
any of these pursuits; and it must be owned, that
where they promote a relish for action and pleasure,
they are so far favourable to human happiness. In
times when industry and arts flourish, men are kept
in perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward,
the occupation itself, as well as those pleasures which
are the fruits of their labour. The mind acquires new
vigour; enlarges its powers and faculties; and by an
assiduity in honest industry, both satisfies its natural
appetites, and prevents the growth of unnatural ones,
which commonly spring up, when nourished with
ease and idleness. Banish those arts from society, you
deprive men both of action and of pleasure; and
leaving nothing but indolence in their place, you
even destory the relish of indolence, which never is
agreeable, but when it succeeds to labour, and re∣cruits
the spirits, exhausted by too much application
and fatigue.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage of industry and of refine∣ments
in the mechanical arts, is, that they common∣ly
produce some refinements in the liberal arts; nor
can the one be carried to perfection, without being
accompanied, in some degree, with the other. The
same age which produces great philosophers and poli∣ticians,
renowned generals and poets, usually abounds
with skilful weavers and ship-carpenters. We can∣not
reasonably expect, that a piece of woollen cloth
will be wrought to perfection in a nation which is ig∣norant
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
of astronomy, or where ethics are neglected.
The spirit of the age affects all the arts; and the
minds of men, being once roused from their lethar∣gy,
and put into a fermentation, turn themselves on
all sides, and carry improvements into every art and
science. Profound ignorance is totally banished, and
men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures, to
think as well as to act, to cultivate the pleasures of
the mind as well as those of the body.</P>
<P>THE more these refined arts advance, the more so∣ciable
do men become; nor is it possible, that, when
inriched with science, and possessed of a fund of con∣versation,
they should be contented to remain in soli∣tude,
or live with their fellow-citizens in that distant
manner, which is peculiar to ignorant and barbarous
nations. They flock into cities; love to receive and
communicate knowledge; to show their wit or their
breeding; their taste in conversation or living, in
cloaths or furniture. Curiosity allures the wise; va∣nity
the foolish; and pleasure both. Particular clubs
and societies are every where formed: Both sexes
meet in an easy and sociable manner; and the tem∣pers
of men, as well as their behaviour, refine apace.
So that, beside the improvements which they receive
from knowledge and the liberal arts, 'tis impossible
but they must feel an increase of humanity, from the
very habit of conversing together, and contributing
to each other's pleasure and entertainment. Thus
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
<HI>industry, knowledge,</HI> and <HI>humanity,</HI> are linked together
by an indissoluble chain, and are found, from expe∣rience
as well as reason, to be peculiar to the more
polished, and, what are commonly denominated, the
more luxurious ages.</P>
<P>NOR are these advantages attended with disadvan∣tages
which bear any proportion to them. The more
men refine upon pleasure, the less will they indulge in
excesses of any kind; because nothing is more de∣structive
to true pleasure than such excesses. One
may safely affirm, that the TARTARS are oftener
guilty of beastly gluttony, when they feast on their
dead horses, than EUROPEAN courtiers with all their
refinements of cookery. And if libertine love, or
even infidelity to the marriage-bed, be more frequent
in polite ages, when it is often regarded only as a
piece of gallantry; drunkenness, on the other hand,
is much less common: A vice more odious, and
more pernicious both to mind and body. And in
this matter I would appeal, not only to an OVID or
a PETRONIUS, but to a SENECA or a CATO. We
know, that CAESAR, during CATALINE<HI>'S</HI> conspiracy,
being necessitated to put into CATO's hands a <HI>billet∣doux,</HI>
which discovered an intrigue with SERVILIA
CATO's own sister, that stern philosopher threw it
back to him with indignation; and, in the bitterness
of his wrath, gave him the appellation of drunkard,
<PB N="31" REF="34"/>
as a term more opprobrious than that with which he
could more justly have reproached him.</P>
<P>BUT industry, knowledge, and humanity, are not
advantageous in private life alone: They diffuse their
beneficial influence on the <HI>public,</HI> and render the go∣vernment
as great and flourishing as they make indi∣viduals
happy and prosperous. The increase and
consumption of all the commodities which serve to
the ornament and pleasure of life, are advantageous
to society; because at the same time that they mul∣tiply
those innocent gratifications to individuals, they
are a kind of <HI>storehouse</HI> of labour, which, in the exi∣gencies
of state, may be turned to the public service.
In a nation, where there is no demand for such super∣fluities,
men sink into indolence, lose all the enjoy∣ment
of life, and are useless to the public, which can∣not
maintain nor support its fleets and armies, from
the industry of such slothful members.</P>
<P>THE bounds of all the EUROPEAN kingdoms are,
at present, pretty near the same they were two hun∣dred
years ago: But what a difference is there in the
power and grandeur of those kingdoms? Which can
be ascribed to nothing but the increase of art and in∣dustry.
When CHARLES VIII. of FRANCE invaded
ITALY, he carried with him about 20,000 men: And
yet this armament so exhausted the nation, as we learn
from GUICCIARDIN, that for some years it was not
<PB N="32" REF="35"/>
able to make so great an effort. The late king of
FRANCE, in time of war, kept in pay above 400,000
men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The inscription on the PLACE-DE-VENDOME says 440,000.</NOTE>; tho', from MAZARINE's death to his own,
he was engaged in a course of wars that lasted near
thirty years.</P>
<P>THIS industry is much promoted by the knowledge
inseparable from the ages of art and refinement; as,
on the other hand, this knowledge enables the public
to make the best advantage of the industry of its sub∣jects.
Laws, order, police, discipline; these can ne∣ver
be carried to any degree of perfection, before hu∣man
reason has refined itself by exercise, and by an
application to the more vulgar arts, at least, of com∣merce
and manufactures. Can we expect, that a go∣vernment
will be well modelled by a people, who
know not how to make a spinning-wheel, or to em∣ploy
a loom to advantage? Not to mention, that all
ignorant ages are infested with superstition, which
throws the government off its bias, and disturbs men
in the pursuit of their interest and happiness.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE in the arts of government naturally
begets mildness and moderation, by instructing men
in the advantages of humane maxims above rigour
and severity, which drive subjects into rebellion, and
render the return to submission impracticable, by cut∣ting
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
off all hopes of pardon. When the tempers of
men are softened as well as their knowledge improv∣ed,
this humanity appears still more conspicuous, and
is the chief characteristic which distinguishes a civili∣zed
age from times of barbarity and ignorance. Fac∣tions
are then less inveterate, revolutions less tragical,
authority less severe, and seditions less frequent.
Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty; and after
the field of battle, where honour and interest steel men
against compassion as well as fear, the combatants di∣vest
themselves of the brute, and resume the man.</P>
<P>NOR need we fear, that men, by losing their fero∣city,
will lose their martial spirit, or become less un∣daunted
and vigorous in defence of their country or
their liberty. The arts have no such effect in ener∣vating
either the mind or body. On the contrary, in∣dustry,
their inseparable attendant, adds new force to
both. And if anger, which is said to be the whet∣stone
of courage, loses somewhat of its asperity, by
politeness and refinement; a sense of honour, which
is a stronger, more constant, and more governable
principle, acquires fresh vigour by that elevation of
genius, which arises from knowledge and a good edu∣cation.
Add to this, that courage can neither have
any duration, nor be of any use, when not accompa∣nied
with discipline and martial skill, which are sel∣dom
found among a barbarous people. The antients
remarked, that DATAMES was the only barbarian
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
that ever knew the art of war. And PYRRHUS see∣ing
the ROMANS marshal their army with some art and
skill, said with surprize, <HI>These barbarians have no∣thing
barbarous in their discipline!</HI> 'Tis observable,
that as the old ROMANS, by applying themselves
solely to war, were the only civilized people that
ever possessed military discipline; so the modern ITA∣LIANS
are the only civilized people, among EURO∣PEANS,
that ever wanted courage and a martial spi∣rit.
Those who would ascribe this effeminacy of the
ITALIANS to their luxury or politeness, or appli∣cation
to the arts, need but consider the FRENCH and
ENGLISH, whose bravery is as uncontestable, as their
love for luxury, and their assiduity in commerce.
The ITALIAN historians give us a more satisfactory
reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen. They
shew us how the sword was dropt at once by all the
ITALIAN sovereigns; while the VENETIAN aristo∣cracy
was jealous of its subjects, the FLORENTINE
democracy applied itself intirely to commerce; ROME
was governed by priests, and NAPLES by women.
War then became the business of soldiers of fortune,
who spared one another, and, to the astonishment of
the world, could engage a whole day in what they
called a battle, and return at night to their camp,
without the least bloodshed.</P>
<P>WHAT has chiefly induced severe moralists to de∣claim
against refinement in the arts, is the example of
<PB N="35" REF="38"/>
antient ROME, which, joining to its poverty and rus∣ticity,
virtue and public spirit, rose to such a surpri∣sing
height of grandeur and liberty; but having
learned from its conquered provinces the ASIATIC
luxury, fell into every kind of corruption; whence
arose sedition and civil wars, attended at last with the
total loss of liberty. All the LATIN classics, whom
we peruse in our infancy, are full of these sentiments,
and universally ascribe the ruin of their state to the
arts and riches imported from the East: Insomuch
that SALLUST represents a taste for painting as a vice
no less than lewdness and drinking. And so popular
were these sentiments, during the latter ages of the
republic, that this author abounds in praises of the
old rigid ROMAN virtue, tho' himself the most egre∣gious
instance of modern luxury and corruption;
speaks contemptuously of GRECIAN eloquence, tho'
the most elegant writer in the world; nay, employs pre∣posterous
digressions and declamations to this purpose,
tho' a model of taste and correctness.</P>
<P>BUT it would be easy to prove, that these writers
mistook the cause of the disorders in the ROMAN
state, and ascribed to luxury and the arts, what real∣ly
proceeded from an ill-modelled government, and
the unlimited extent of conquests. Refinement on
the pleasures and conveniencies of life has no natural
tendency to beget venality and corruption. The va∣lue
which all men put upon any particular pleasure, de∣pends
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
on comparison and experience; nor is a porter
less greedy of money, which he spends on bacon and
brandy, than a courtier, who purchases champagne
and ortolans. Riches are valuable at all times, and to
all men, because they always purchase pleasures, such
as men are accustomed to, and desire: Nor can any
thing restrain or regulate the love of money, but a
sense of honour and virtue; which, if it be not near∣ly
equal at all times, will naturally abound most in
ages of knowledge and refinement.</P>
<P>OF all EUROPEAN kingdoms, POLAND seems the
most defective in the arts of war, as well as peace,
mechanical as well as liberal; and yet 'tis there that
venality and corruption do most prevail. The nobles
seem to have preserved their crown elective for no
other purpose, but regularly to sell it to the highest
bidder. This is almost the only species of commerce
with which that people are acquainted.</P>
<P>THE liberties of ENGLAND, so far from decaying
since the improvements in the arts, have never flou∣rished
so much as during that period. And tho' cor∣ruption
may seem to increase of late years; this is
chiefly to be ascribed to our established liberty, when
our princes have found the impossibility of governing
without parliaments, or of terrifying parliaments by
the phantom of prerogative. Not to mention, that
this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
among the electors than the elected; and therefore
cannot justly be ascribed to any refinements in luxury.</P>
<P>IF we consider the matter in a proper light, we
shall find, that improvements in the arts are rather
favourable to liberty, and have a natural tendency to
preserve, if not produce a free government. In rude
unpolished nations, where the arts are neglected, all
the labour is bestowed on the cultivation of the
ground; and the whole society divides into two
classes, proprietors of land, and their vassals or te∣nants.
The latter are necessarily dependent, and fit∣ted
for slavery and subjection; especially where they
possess no riches, and are not valued for their know∣ledge
in agriculture; as must always be the case where
the arts are neglected. The former naturally erect
themselves into petty tyrants; and must either submit
to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order;
or if they will preserve their independency, like the
GOTHIC barons, they must fall into feuds and contests
among themselves, and throw the whole society into
such confusion, as is perhaps worse than the most de∣spotic
government. But where luxury nourishes com∣merce
and industry, the peasants, by a proper culti∣vation
of the land, become rich and independent;
while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of
the property, and draw authority and consideration to
that middling rank of men, who are the best and
firmest basis of public liberty. These submit not to
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
slavery, like the poor peasants, from poverty and
meanness of spirit; and having no hopes of tyranni∣zing
over others, like the barons, they are not
tempted, for the sake of that gratification, to submit
to the tyranny of their sovereign. They covet equal
laws, which may secure their property, and preserve
them from monarchical, as well as aristocratical ty∣ranny.</P>
<P>THE
house of Commons is the support of our po∣pular
government; and all the world acknowledge,
that it owed its chief influence and consideration to
the increase of commerce, which threw such a ba∣lance
of property into the hands of the Commons.
How inconsistent then is it to blame so violently a re∣finement
in the arts, and to represent it as the bane
of liberty and public spirit!</P>
<P>To declaim against present times, and magnify
the virtue of remote ancestors, is a propensity almost
inherent in human nature: And as the sentiments and
opinions of civilized ages alone are transmitted to pos∣terity,
hence it is that we meet with so many severe
judgments pronounced against luxury, and even sci∣ence;
and hence it is that at present we give so ready
an assent to them. But the fallacy is easily perceived
from comparing different nations that are contempo∣raries;
where we both judge more impartially, and
can better set in opposition those manners with which
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
we are sufficiently acquainted. Treachery and cu∣elty,
the most pernicious and most odious of all vi∣ces,
seem peculiar to uncivilized ages; and by the re∣fined
GREEKS and ROMANS were ascribed to all the
barbarous nations, which surrounded them. They
might justly, therefore, have presumed, that their
own ancestors, so highly celebrated, possessed no
greater virtue, and were as much inferior to their
posterity in honour and humanity, as in taste and sci∣ence.
An antient FRANK or SAXON may be highly
extolled: But I believe every man would think his
life or fortune much less secure in the hands of a
MOOR or TARTAR, than in those of a FRENCH or
ENGLISH gentleman, the rank of men the most civi∣lized
in the most civilized nations.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>second</HI> position which we pro∣posed
to illustrate, <HI>viz.</HI> that as innocent luxury, or a
refinement in the arts and conveniencies of life, is ad∣vantageous
to the public; so where-ever luxury cea∣ses
to be innocent, it also ceases to be beneficial; and
when carried a degree farther, begins to be a quality
pernicious, tho', perhaps, not the most pernicious, to
political society.</P>
<P>LET us consider what we call vicious luxury. No
gratification, however sensual, can of itself be esteem∣ed
vicious. A gratification is only vicious, when it en∣grosses
all a man's expence, and leaves no ability for
<PB N="40" REF="43"/>
such acts of duty and generosity as are required by
his situation and fortune. Suppose, that he correct
the vice, and employ part of his expence in the edu∣cation
of his children, in the support of his friends,
and in relieving the poor; would any prejudice result
to society? On the contrary, the same consumption
would arise; and that labour, which, at present, is
employed only in producing a slender gratification to
one man, would relieve the necessitous, and bestow
satisfaction on hundreds. The same care and toil
which raise a dish of peas at CHRISTMAS, would
give bread to a whole family during six months. To
say, that, without a vicious luxury, the labour would
not have been employed at all, is only to say, that
there is some other defect in human nature, such as
indolence, selfishness, inattention to others, for which
luxury in some measure provides a remedy; as one
poison may be an antidote to another. But virtue,
like wholsome food, is better than poisons, however
corrected.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the same number of men that are at pre∣sent
in BRITAIN, with the same soil and climate; I
ask, is it not possible for them to be happier, by the
most perfect way of life which can be imagined, and
by the greatest reformation which Omnipotence itself
could work in their temper and disposition? To as∣sert,
that they cannot, appears evidently ridiculous.
As the land is able to maintain more than all its in∣habitants,
<PB N="41" REF="44"/>
they could never, in such an UTOPIAN
state, feel any other ills than those which arise from
bodily sickness; and these are not the half of human
miseries. All other ills spring from some vice, either
in ourselves or others; and even many of our diseases
proceed from the same origin. Remove the vices,
and the ills follow. You must only take care to re∣move
all the vices. If you remove part, you may
render the matter worse. By banishing <HI>vicious</HI> luxu∣ry,
without curing sloth and an indifference to others,
you only diminish industry in the state, and add no∣thing
to mens charity or their generosity. Let us,
therefore, rest contented with asserting, that two op∣posite
vices in a state may be more advantageous than
either of them alone; but let us never pronounce vice
in itself advantageous. Is it not very inconsistent for
an author to assert in one page, that moral distinctions
are inventions of politicians for public interest; and
in the next page maintain, that vice is advantageous
to the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fable of the bees.</NOTE>? And indeed it seems, upon any
system of morality, little less than a contradiction in
terms, to talk of a vice which is in general beneficial
to society.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this reasoning necessary, in order to
give some light to a philosophical question, which
has been much disputed in BRITAIN. I call it a
<HI>philosophical</HI> question, not a <HI>political</HI> one. For what∣ever
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
may be the consequence of such a miraculous
transformation of mankind, as would endow them
with every species of virtue, and free them from
every species of vice; this concerns not the magis∣trate,
who aims only at possibilities. He cannot cure
every vice, by substituting a virtue in its place.
Very often he can only cure one vice by another; and
in that case, he ought to prefer what is least perni∣cious
to society. Luxury, when excessive, is the
source of many ills; but is in general preferable to
sloth and idleness, which would commonly succeed
in its place, and are more pernicious both to private
persons and to the public. When sloth reigns, a
mean uncultivated way of life prevails amongst indi∣viduals,
without society, without enjoyment. And
if the sovereign, in such a situation, demands the
service of his subjects, the labour of the state suffices
only to furnish the necessaries of life to the labourers,
and can afford nothing to those who are employed in
the public service.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of MONEY.</HEAD>
<P>MONEY is not, properly speaking, one of the
subjects of commerce; but only the instru∣ment
which men have agreed upon to facilitate the
exchange of one commodity for another. 'Tis none
of the wheels of trade: 'Tis the oil which renders
the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy. If
we consider any one kingdom by itself, 'tis evident,
that the greater or less plenty of money is of no con∣sequence;
since the prices of commodities are always
proportioned to the plenty of money, and a crown
in HARRY VII.'s time served the same purpose as a
pound does at present. 'Tis only the <HI>public</HI> which
draws any advantage from the greater plenty of mo∣ney;
and that only in its wars and negotiations with
foreign states. And this is the reason, why all rich
and trading countries, from CARTHAGE to BRITAIN
and HOLLAND, have employed mercenary troops,
which they hired from their poorer neighbours. Were
they to make use of their native subjects, they would
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
find less advantage from their superior riches, and
from their great plenty of gold and silver; since the
pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the
public opulence. Cur small army in BRITAIN of
20,000 men are maintained at as great expence as a
FRENCH army thrice as numerous. The ENGLISH
fleet, during the late war, required as much money
to support it as all the ROMAN legions, which kept
the whole world in subjection, during the time of the
emperors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A private soldier in the ROMAN infantry had a denarius a-day, somewhat less than eight pence. The ROMAN empe∣rors had commonly 25 legions in pay, which, allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000. TACIT. <HI>Ann. lib.</HI> 4. 'Tis true, there were also auxiliaries to the legions; but their num∣bers are uncertain, as well as their pay. To consider only the legionaries, the pay of the private men could not exceed 1,600,000 pound. Now, the parliament in the last war com∣monly allowed for the fleet 2,500,000. We have therefore 900,000 over for the officers and other expences of the ROMAN legions. There seem to have been but few officers in the ROMAN armies, in comparison of what are employed in all our modern troops, except some SWISS corps. And these officers had very small pay: A centurion, for instance, only double a common soldier. And as the soldiers from their pay (TACIT. <HI>Ann. lib.</HI> 1.) bought their own cloaths, arms, tents, and baggage; this must also diminish considerably the other charges of the army. So little expensive was that mighty government, and so easy was its yoke over the world. And, indeed, this is the more natural conclusion from the foregoing calculations. For money, after the conquest of EGYPT, seems to have been nearly in as great plenty at ROME, as it is at present in the richest of the EUROPEAN kingdoms.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="48"/>
THE greater number of people and their greater
industry are serviceable in all cases; at home and a∣broad,
in private, and in public. But the greater
plenty of money is very limited in its use, and may
even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce
with foreigners.</P>
<P>THERE seems to be a happy concurrence of causes
in human affairs, which check the growth of trade
and riches, and hinder them from being confined in∣tirely
to one people; as might naturally at first be
dreaded from the advantages of an established com∣merce.
Where one nation has got the start of ano∣ther
in trade, 'tis very difficult for the latter to regain
the ground it has lost; because of the superior indus∣try
and skill of the former, and the greater stocks, of
which its merchants are possessed, and which enable
them to trade for so much smaller profits. But these
advantages are compensated, in some measure, by the
low price of labour in every nation which has not an
extensive commerce, and does not very much abound
in gold and silver. Manufactures, therefore, gradu∣ally
shift their places, leaving those countries and pro∣vinces
which they have already inriched, and flying
to others, whither they are allured by the cheapness
<PB N="46" REF="49"/>
of provisions and labour; till they have inriched these
also, and are again banished by the same causes. And,
in general, we may observe, that the dearness of
every thing, from plenty of money, is a disadvan∣tage,
which attends an established commerce, and sets
bounds to it in every country, by enabling the poorer
states to undersel the richer in all foreign markets.</P>
<P>THIS has made me entertain a great doubt concer∣ning
the benefit of <HI>banks</HI> and <HI>paper-credit,</HI> which are
so generally esteemed advantageous to every nation.
That provisions and labour should become dear by the
increase of trade and money, is, in many respects, an
inconvenience; but an inconvenience that is unavoid∣able,
and the effect of that public wealth and prospe∣rity
which are the end of all our wishes. 'Tis com∣pensated
by the advantages which we reap, from the
possession of these precious metals, and the weight
which they give the nation in all foreign wars and ne∣gotiations.
But there appears no reason for increas∣ing
that inconvenience by a counterfeit money, which
foreigners will not accept in any payment, and which
any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing.
There are, 'tis true, many people in every rich state,
who, having large sums of money, would prefer pa∣per
with good security; as being of more easy trans∣port
and more safe custody. If the public provide
not a bank, private bankers will take advantage of
this circumstance; as the goldsmiths formerly did
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
in LONDON, or as the bankers do at present in DUB∣LIN:
And therefore 'tis better, it may be thought,
that a public company should enjoy the benefit of
that paper-credit, which always will have place in
every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour artificial∣ly
to increase such a credit, can never be the interest
of any trading nation; but must lay them under dis∣advantages,
by increasing money beyond its natural
proportion to labour and commodities, and thereby
heightening their price to the merchant and manufac∣turer.
And in this view, it must be allowed, that
no bank could be more advantageous than such a one
as locked up all the money it received<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is the case with the bank of AMSTERDAM.</NOTE>, and never
augmented the circulating coin, as is usual, by re∣turning
part of its treasure into commerce. A pub∣lic
bank, by this expedient, might cut off much of
the dealings of private bankers and money-jobbers;
and tho' the state bore the charge of salaries to the di∣rectors
and tellers of this bank, (for, according to
the preceding supposition, it would have no profit
from its dealings), the national advantage, resulting
from the low price of labour and the destruction of
paper-credit, would be a sufficient compensation.
Not to mention, that so large a sum, lying ready at
command, would be a great convenience in times of
public danger and distress; and what part of it was
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
used might be replaced at leisure, when peace and
tranquillity were restored to the nation.</P>
<P>BUT of this subject of paper-credit we shall treat
more largely hereafter. And I shall finish this essay
on money, by proposing and explaining two obser∣vations,
which may, perhaps, serve to employ the
thoughts of our speculative politicians. For the these
only I all along address myself. 'Tis enough, that I
submit to the ridicule sometimes, in this age, attach∣ed
to the character of a philosopher, without adding
to it that which belongs to a projector.</P>
<P>IT was a shrewd observation of ANACHARSIS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUT. <HI>Quomodo quis suos profectus in virtute sentire possit.</HI></NOTE> the
SCYTHIAN, who had neve seen money in his own
country, that gold and silver seemed to him of no use
to the GREEKS, but to assist them in numeration and
arithmetic. 'Tis indeed evident, that money is no∣thing
but the representation of labour and commodi∣ties,
and serves only as a method of rating or esti∣mating
them. Where coin is in greater plenty; as a
greater quantity of it is required to represent the same
quantity of goods; it can have no effect, either good
or bad, taking a nation within itself; no more than
it would make any alteration on a merchant's books,
if, instead of the ARABIAN method of notation,
which requires few characters, he should make use of
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
the ROMAN, which requires a great many. Nay, the
greater quantity of money, like the ROMAN charac∣ters,
is rather inconvenient, and requires greater trou∣ble
both to keep and transport it. But notwithstand∣ing
this conclusion, which must be allowed just, 'tis
certain, that, since the discovery of the mines in
AMERICA, industry has increased in all the nations
of EUROPE, except in the possessors of those mines;
and this may justly be ascribed, amongst other rea∣sons,
to the increase of gold and silver. According∣ly
we find, that in every kingdom, into which money
begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly,
every thing takes a new face; labour and industry
gain life; the merchant becomes more enterprising,
the manufacturer-more diligent and skilful, and even
the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity
and attention. This is not easily to be accounted
for, if we consider only the influence which a greater
abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself, by
heightening the price of commodities, and obliging
every one to pay a greater number of these little yel∣low
or white pieces for every thing he purchases.
And as to foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty
of money is rather disadvantageous, by raising the
price of every kind of labour.</P>
<P>To account, then, for this phaenomenon, we must
consider, that tho' the high price of commodities be
a necessary consequence of the increase of gold and
<PB N="50" REF="53"/>
silver, yet it follows not immediately upon that in∣crease;
but some time is required before the money
circulate thro' the whole state, and make its effects be
felt on all ranks of people. At first, no alteration is
perceived; by degrees, the price rises, first of one
commodity, then of another; till the whole at last
reaches a just proportion with the new quantity of spe∣cie
which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, 'tis
only in this interval or intermediate situation, between
the acquisition of money and rise of prices, that the in∣creasing
quantity of gold and silver is favourable to
industry. When any quantity of money is imported
into a nation, it is not at first dispersed into many
hands; but is confined to the coffers of a few persons,
who immediately seek to employ it to the best advan∣tage.
Here are a set of manufacturers or merchants,
we shall suppose, who have received returns of gold
and silver for goods which they sent to CADIZ. They
are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than
formerly, who never dream of demanding higher
wages, but are glad of employment from such good
paymasters. If workmen become scarce, the manu∣facturer
gives higher wages, but at first requires an in∣crease
of labour; and this is willingly submitted to
by the artisan, who can now eat and drink better, to
compensate his additional toil and fatigue. He car∣ries
his money to market, where he finds every thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g
at the same price as formerly, but returns with great∣er
quantity and of better kinds, for the use of his
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
family. The farmer and gardener, finding, that all
their commodities are taken off, apply themselves
with alacrity to the raising more; and at the same
time can afford to take better and more cloths from
their tradesmen, whose price is the same as formerly,
and their industry only whetted by so much new gain.
'Tis easy to trace the money in its progress thro' the
whole commonwealth; where we shall find, that it
must first quicken the diligence of every individual,
before it increase the price of labour.</P>
<P>AND that the specie may increase to a considerable
pitch, before it have this latter effect, appears, a∣mongst
other instances, from the frequent operations
of the FRENCH king on the money; where it was
always found, that the augmenting the numerary va∣lue
did not produce a proportional rise of the prices,
at least for some time. In the last year of LOUIS XIV,
money was raised three sevenths, but prices augment∣ed
only one. Corn in FRANCE is now sold at the
same price, or for the same number of livres it was
in 1683' tho' silver was then at 30 livres the mark,
and is now at 50<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>These facts I give upon the authority of Mons. du TOT in his <HI>Reflexions politiques,</HI> an author of reputation. Tho' I must confess, that the facts which he advances on other occasions, are often so suspicious, as to make his authority less in this matter. However, the general observation, that the augmenting the money in FRANCE does not at first proportionably augment the prices, is certainly just.</P>
<P>By the by, this seems to be one of the best reasons which can be given, for a gradual and universal augmentation of the mo∣ney, tho' it has been intirely overlooked in all those volumes which have been wrote on that question by MELON, du TOT, and PARIS de VERNEY. Were all our money, for instance, recoined, and a penny's worth of silver taken from every shil∣ling, the new shilling would probably purchase every thing that could have been bought by the old; the prices of every thing would thereby be insensbly diminished; foreign trade enlivened; and domestic industry, by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and shillings, would receive some increase and encourage∣ment. In executing such a project, 'twould be better to make the new shilling pass for 24 half-pence, in order to preserve the illusion, and make it be taken for the same. And as a recoin∣age of our silver begins to be requisite, by the continual wearing of our shillings and sixpences, it may be doubtful, whether we ought to imitate the example in King WILLIAM's reign, when the clipt money was raised to the old standard.</P></NOTE>. Not to mention the great addi∣tion
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
of gold and silver, which may have come into
that kingdom since the former period.</P>
<P>FROM the whole of this reasoning we may conclude,
that 'tis of no manner of consequence, with regard to
the domestic happiness of a state, whether money be
in a greater or less quantity. The good policy of the
magistrate consists only in keeping it, if possible, still
increasing; because, by that means, he keeps alive a
spirit of industry in the nation, and increases the
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
stock of labour, in which consists all real power and
riches. A nation whose money decreases, is actually,
at that time, much weaker and more miserable than
another nation, who possesses no more money, but is
on the increasing hand. This will be easily account∣ed
for, if we consider, that the alterations in the
quantity of money, either on the one side or the o∣ther,
are not immediately attended with proportion∣able
alterations in the prices of commodities. There
is always an interval before matters be adjusted to
their new situation; and this interval is as pernicious
to industry when gold and silver are diminishing, as it
is advantageous when these metals are increasing.
The workman has not the same employment from the
manufacturer and merchant; tho' he pays the same
price for every thing in the market. The farmer
cannot dispose of his corn and cattle; tho' he must
pay the same rent to his landlord. The poverty, and
beggary, and sloth, which must ensue, are easily
foreseen.</P>
<P>II. THE second observation which I proposed to
make with regard to money, may be explained after
the following manner. There are some kingdoms,
and many provinces in EUROPE, (and all of them
were once in the same condition) where money is so
scarce, that the landlord can get none at all from his
tenants; but is obliged to take his rent in kind, and
either to consume it himself, or transport it to places
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
where he may find a market. In those countries, the
prince can levy few or no taxes, but in the same
manner: And as he will receive very small benefit
from impositions so paid, 'tis evident that such a
kingdom has very little force even at home; and can∣not
maintain fleets and armies to the same extent, as
if every part of it abounded in gold and silver. There
is surely a greater disproportion betwixt the force of
GERMANY at present and what it was three centuries
ago<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The ITALIANS gave to the emperor MAXIMILIAN, the nick-name of POCCI-DANARI. None of the enterprises of that prince ever succeeded, for want of money.</NOTE>, than there is in its industry, people, and ma∣nufactures.
The AUSTRIAN dominions in the em∣pire
are in general well peopled and well cultivated,
and are of great extent; but have not a proportion∣able
weight in the balance of EUROPE; proceeding,
as is commonly supposed, from the scarcity of money.
How do all these facts agree with that principle of
reason, that the quantity of gold and silver is in itself
altogether indifferent? According to that principle,
where ever a sovereign has numbers of subjects, and
these have plenty of commodities, he should of course
be great and powerful, and they rich and happy, in∣dependent
of the greater or lesser abundance of the
precious metals. These admit of divisions and sub∣divisions
to a great extent; and where they would be∣come
<PB N="55" REF="58"/>
so small as to be in danger of being lost, 'tis
easy to mix them with a baser metal, as is practised in
some countries of EUROPE; and by that means raise
them to a bulk more sensible and convenient. They
still serve the same purposes of exchange, whatever
their number may be, or whatever colour they may be
supposed to have.</P>
<P>TO These difficulties I answer, that the effect here
supposed to flow from scarcity of money, really arises
from the manners and customs of the inhabitants;
and that we mistake, as is too usual, a collateral ef∣fect
for a cause. The contradiction is only apparent;
but it requires some thought and reflection to discover
the principles by which we can reconcile <HI>reason</HI> to <HI>ex∣perience.</HI></P>
<P>IT
seems a maxim almost self-evident, that the pri∣ces
of every thing depend on the proportion between
commodities and money, and that any considerable
alteration on either of these has the same effect, either
of heightening or lowering the prices. Increase the
commodities, they become cheaper; increase the
money, they rise in their value. As, on the other
hand, a diminution of the former, and that of the
latter, have contrary tendencies.</P>
<P>'TIS also evident, that the prices do not so much
depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
that of money, which are in a nation, as on that of
the commodities, which come or may come to mar∣ket,
and of the money which circulates. If the coin
be locked up in chests, 'tis the same thing with re∣gard
to prices, as if it were annihilated: If the com∣modities
be hoarded in granaries, a like effect fol∣lows.
As the money and commodities, in these ca∣ses,
never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were
we, at any time, to form conjectures concerning the
price of provisions, the corn which the farmer must
reserve for the maintenance of himself and family,
ought never to enter into the estimation. 'Tis only
the overplus, compared to the demand, that deter∣mines
the value.</P>
<P>TO apply these principles, we must consider, that
in the first and more uncultivated ages of any state,
ere fancy has confounded her wants with those of na∣ture,
men, contented with the productions of their
own fields, or with those rude preparations which
they themselves can work upon them, have little oc∣casion
for exchange, or at least for money, which, by
agreement, is the common measure of exchange.
The wool of the farmer's own flock, spun in his own
family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who
receives his payment in corn or wool, suffices for fur∣niture
and cloathing. The carpenter, the smith, the
mason, the tailor, are retained by wages of a like
nature; and the landlord himself, dwelling in the
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
neighbourhood, is contented to receive his rent in the
commodities raised by the farmer. The greatest part
of these he consumes at home, in rustic hospitality:
The rest, perhaps, he disposes of for money to the
neighbouring town, whence he draws the few mate∣rials
of his expence and luxury.</P>
<P>BUT after men begin to refine on all these enjoy∣ments,
and live not always at home, nor are content∣ed
with what can be raised in their neighbourhood,
there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds,
and more money enters into that exchange. The
tradesmen will not be paid in corn; because they
want something more than barely to eat. The farmer
goes beyond his own parish for the commodities he
purchases, and cannot always carry his commodities
to the merchant who supplies him. The landlord
lives in the capital, or in a foreign country; and de∣mands
his rent in gold and silver, which can easily be
transported to him. Great undertakers, and manu∣facturers,
and merchants, arise in every commodity;
and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in
specie. And consequently, in this situation of soci∣ety,
the coin enters into many more contracts, and
by that means is much more employed than in the
former.</P>
<P>THE necessary effect is, that, provided the money
does not increase in the nation, every thing must be∣come
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
much cheaper in times of industry and refine∣ment,
than in rude, uncultivated ages. 'Tis the pro∣portion
between the circulating money, and the com∣modities
in the market, which determines the prices.
Goods that are consumed at home, or exchanged with
other goods in the neighbourhood, never come to
market; they affect not in the least the current specie;
with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated;
and consequently this method of using them sinks the
proportion on the side of the commodities, and in∣creases
the prices. But after money enters into all
contracts and sales, and is every where the measure of
exchange, the same national cash has a much greater
task to perform; all commodities are then in the
market; the sphere of circulation is enlarged; 'tis
the same case as if that individual sum were to serve a
larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion being
here lessened on the side of the money, every thing
must become cheaper, and the prices gradually fall.</P>
<P>BY the most exact computations that have been
formed all over EUROPE, after making allowance for
the alteration in the numerary value or the denomi∣nation,
'tis found, that the prices of all things have
only risen three, or at most, four times, since the dis∣covery
of the WEST INDIES. But will any one as∣sert,
that there is not four times the coin in EUROPE,
that was in the fifteenth century, and the centuries
preceding it? The SPANIARDS and PORTUGUESE
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
from their mines, the ENGLISH, FRENCH, and
DUTCH, by their AFRICAN trade, and by their inter-lopers
in the WEST INDIES, bring home about six
millions a-year, of which not above a third part goes
to the EAST INDIES. This sum alone in ten years
would probably double the antient stock of money in
EUROPE. And no other satisfactory reason can be
given, why all prices have not risen to a much more
exorbitant height, except that derived from a change
of customs and manners. Besides that more commo∣dities
are produced by additional industry, the same
commodities come more to market, after men depart
from their antient simplicity of manners. And tho'
this increase has not been equal to that of money, it
has, however, been considerable, and has preserved
the proportion between coin and commodities nearer
the antient standard.</P>
<P>WERE the question proposed, Which of these me∣thods
of living in the people, the simple or the refi∣ned,
is the most advantageous to the state or public?
I should, without much scruple, prefer the latter, in a
view to politics at least; and should produce this as
an additional reason for the encouragement of trade
and manufactures.</P>
<P>WHEN men live in the antient simple manner, and
supply all their necessaries from domestic industry or
from the neighbourhood, the sovereign can levy no
<PB N="60" REF="63"/>
taxes in money from a considerable part of his sub∣jects;
and if he will impose on them any burdens, he
must take his payment in commodities, with which
alone they abound; a method attended with such
great and obvious inconveniencies, that they need
not here be insisted on. All the money he can pre∣tend
to raise, must be from his principal cities, where
alone it circulates; and these, 'tis evident, cannot af∣ford
him so much as the whole state could, did gold
and silver circulate thro' the whole. But besides this
obvious diminution of the revenue, there is also ano∣ther
cause of the poverty of the public in such a situ∣ation.
Not only the sovereign receives less money,
but the same money goes not so far as in times of in∣dustry
and general commerce. Every thing is dearer,
where the gold and silver are supposed equal; and
that because fewer commodities come to market, and
the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what is to
be purchased by it; whence alone the prices of every
thing are fixed and determined.</P>
<P>HERE then we may learn the fallacy of the remark,
often to be met with in historians, and even in com∣mon
conversation, that any particular state is weak,
tho' fertile, populous, and well cultivated, merely be∣cause
it wants money. It appears, that the want of
money can never injure any state within itself: For
men and commodities are the real strength of any
community. 'Tis the simple manner of living which
<PB N="61" REF="64"/>
here hurts the public, by confining the gold and silver
to few hands, and preventing its universal diffusion
and circulation. On the contrary, industry and re∣finements
of all kinds incorporate it with the whole
state, however small its quantity may be: They di∣gest
it into every vein, so to speak; and make it en∣ter
into every transaction and contract. No hand is
intirely empty of it. And as the prices of every
thing fall by that means, the sovereign has a double
advantage: He may draw money by his taxes from
every part of the state; and what he receives, goes
farther in every purchase and payment.</P>
<P>WE may infer, from a comparison of prices, that
money is not more plentiful in CHINA, than it was in
EUROPE three centuries ago: But what immense
power is that empire possessed of, if we may judge by
the civil and military list maintained by it? POLYBIUS
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib▪ 2. cap. 15▪</NOTE> tells us, that provisions were so cheap in ITALY
during his time, that in some places the stated club in
the inns was a <HI>semis</HI> a-head, little more than a far∣thing?
Yet the ROMAN power had even then sub∣dued
the whole known world. About a century be∣fore
that period, the CARTHAGINIAN ambassador
said, by way of raillery, that no people lived more
sociably amongst themselves than the ROMANS; for
that in every entertainment, which, as foreign minis∣ters,
they received, they still observed the same plate
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
at every table<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLIN. lib. 33. cap. 11.</NOTE>. The absolute quantity of the pre∣cious
metals is a matter of great indifference. There
are only two circumstances of any importance, <HI>viz.</HI>
their gradual increase, and their thorough concoction
and circulation thro' the state; and the influence of
both these circumstances has been here explained.</P>
<P>IN the following Essay we shall see an instance of a
like fallacy as that above-mentioned; where a colla∣teral

however plentiful, has no other effect, <HI>if fixed,</HI> than
to raise the price of labour. Silver is more common
than gold; and therefore you receive a greater quan∣tity
of it for the same commodities. But do you pay
less interest for it? Interest in BATAVIA and JAMAICA
is at 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> in PORTUGAL at 6; tho' these
places, as we may learn from the prices of every thing,
abound much more in gold and silver than either
LONDON or AMSTERDAM.</P>
<P>WERE all the gold in ENGLAND annihilated at once,
and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place
of every guinea, would money be more plentiful or
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
interest lower? No surely: We should only use silver
instead of gold. Were gold rendered as common as
silver, and silver as common as copper; would money
be more plentiful or interest lower? We may assuredly
give the same answer. Our shillings would then be
yellow, and our halfpence white; and we should have
no guineas. No other difference would ever be ob∣served;
no alteration on commerce, manufactures,
navigation, or interest; unless we imagine, that the
colour of the metal is of any consequence.</P>
<P>NOW, what is so visible in these greater variations
of scarcity or abundance of the precious metals, must
hold in all inferior changes. If the multiplying gold
and silver fifteen times makes no difference, much less
can the doubling or tripling them. All augmentation
has no other effect than to heighten the price of la∣bour
and commodities; and even this variation is
little more than that of a name. In the progress to∣wards
these changes, the augmentation may have some
influence, by exciting industry; but after the prices
are settled, suitable to the new abundance of gold and
silver, it has no manner of influence.</P>
<P>AN effect always holds proportion with its cause.
Prices have risen about four times since the discovery
of the INDIES; and 'tis probable gold and silver have
multiplied much more: But interest has not fallen
much above half. The rate of interest, therefore,
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
is not derived from the quantity of the precious
metals.</P>
<P>MONEY having merely a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictitious value, arising
from the agreement and convention of men, the
greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence, if
we consider a nation within itself; and the quantity
of specie, when once fixed, tho' never so large, has
no other effect, than to oblige every one to tell out a
greater number of those shining bits of metal, for
cloaths, furniture, or equipage, without increasing
any one convenience of life. If a man borrows
money to build a house, he then carries home a
greater load; because the stone, timber, lead, glass,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the labour of the masons and carpenters,
are represented by a greater quantity of gold and
silver. But as these metals are considered merely as
representations, there can no alteration arise, from
their bulk or quantity, their weight or colour, either
upon their real value or their interest. The same
interest, in all cases, bears the same proportion to the
sum. And if you lent me so much labour and so
many commodities; by receiving five <HI>per cent.</HI> you re∣ceive
always proportional labour and commodities,
however represented, whether by yellow or white
coin, whether by a pound or an ounce. 'Tis in vain,
therefore, to look for the cause of the fall or rise of
interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and
silver, which is fixed in any nation.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69"/>
HIGH interest arises from <HI>three</HI> circumstances: A
great demand for borrowing; little riches to supply
that demand; and great profits arising from commerce.
And these circumstances are a clear proof of the small
advance of commerce and industry, not of the scar∣city
of gold and silver. Low interest, on the other
hand, proceeds from the three opposite circumstances:
A small demand for borrowing; great riches to sup∣ply
that demand; and small profits arising from com∣merce.
And these circumstances are all connected to∣gether,
and proceed from the increase of industry and
commerce, not of gold and silver. We shall endea∣vour
to prove these points as fully and distinctly as
possible; and shall begin with the causes and the ef∣fects
of a great or small demand for borrowing.</P>
<P>WHEN a people have emerged ever so little from
a savage state, and their numbers have increased be∣yond
the original multitude, there must immediately
arise an inequality of property; and while some pos∣sess,
large tracts of land, others are confined within
narrow limits, and some are entirely without any
landed property. Those who possess more land
than they can labour, employ those who possess none,
and agree to receive a determinate part of the pro∣duct.
Thus the <HI>landed</HI> interest is immediately esta∣blished;
nor is there any settled government, how∣ever
rude, in which affairs are not on this footing.
Of these proprietors of land, some must presently dis∣cover
<PB N="67" REF="70"/>
themselves to be of different tempers from
others; and while one would willingly store up the
product of his land for futurity, another desires to con∣sume
at present what should suffice for many years.
But as the spending a settled revenue is a way of life
entirely without occupation; men have so much need
of somewhat to fix and engage them, that pleasures'
such as they are, will be the pursuit of the greatest
part of the landholders, and the prodigals amongst
them will always be more numerous than the misers.
In a state, therefore, where there is nothing but a
landed interest, as there is little frugality, the bor∣rowers
may be very numerous, and the rate of interest
must hold proportion to it. The difference depends
not on the quantity of money, but on the habits and
manners which prevail. By this alone the demand
for borrowing is increased or diminished. Were mo∣ney
so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for six-pence;
so long as there are only landed gentry and
peasants in the state, the borrowers must be numerous,
and interest high. The rent for the same farm would
be heavier and more bulky: But the same idleness of
the landlord, with the higher prices of commodities,
would dissipate it in the same time, and produce the
same necessity and demand for borrowing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have been informed by a very eminent lawyer, and a man of great knowlege and observation, that it appears from antient papers and records, that, about four centuries ago, money, in SCOTLAND, and probably in other parts of EUROPE, was only at five <HI>per cent.</HI> and afterwards rose to ten before the discovery of the WEST-INDIES. This fact is curious; but might easily be reconciled to the foregoing reasoning. Men, in that age, lived so much at home, and in so very simple and frugal a manner, that they had no occasion for money; and tho' the lenders were then few, the borrowers were still fewer. The high rate of in∣terest among the early ROMANS is accounted for by historians from the frequent losses sustained by the inroads of the enemy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71"/>
NOR is the case different with regard to the <HI>second</HI>
circumstance which we proposed to consider, <HI>viz.</HI> the
great or little riches to supply this demand. This
effect also depends on the habits and ways of living
of the people, not on the quantity of gold and silver.
In order to have, in any state, a great number of
lenders, 'tis not sufficient nor requisite that there be
great abundance of precious metals. 'Tis only requi∣site
that the property or command of that quantity,
which is in the state, whether great or small, should
be collected in particular hands, so as to form consi∣derable
sums, or compose a great monied interest.
This begets a number of lenders, and sinks the rate
of usury; and this, I shall venture to affirm, depends
not on the quantity of specie, but on particular man∣ners
and customs, which make the specie gather into
separate sums or masses of considerable value.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72"/>
FOR suppose, that, by miracle, every man in BRI∣TAIN
should have five pounds slipt into his pocket
in one night; this would much more than double the
whole money that is at present in the kingdom; and
yet there would not next day, nor for some time, be
any more lenders, nor any variation on the interest.
And were there nothing but landlords and peasants in
the state, this money, however abundant, could ne∣ver
gather into sums; and would only serve to increase
the prices of every thing, without any farther conse∣quence.
The prodigal landlord dissipates it, as fast
as he receives it; and the beggarly peasant has no
means, nor view, nor ambition of obtaining above a
bare livelihood. The overplus of borrowers above
that of lenders continuing still the same, there will
follow no reduction of interest. That depends upon
another principle; and must proceed from an increase
of industry and frugality, of arts and commerce.</P>
<P>EVERY thing useful to the life of man arises from
the ground; but few things arise in that condition
which is requisite to render them useful. There must,
therefore, beside the peasants, and the proprietors of
land, be another rank of men, who, receiving from
the former, the rude materials, work them into their
proper form, and retain part for their own use and
subsistence. In the infancy of society, these contracts
betwixt the artisans and the peasants, and betwixt one
species of artisans and another, are commonly entered
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
into immediately by the persons themselves, who, be∣ing
neighbours, are easily acquainted with each other's
necessities, and can lend their mutual assistance to sup∣ply
them. But when men's industry increases, and
their views enlarge, 'tis found, that the most remote
parts of the state can assist each other as well as the
more contiguous, and that this intercourse of good
offices may be carried on to the greatest extent and
intricacy. Hence the origin of <HI>merchants,</HI> the most
useful race of men in the whole society, who serve
as agents between those parts of the state, that are
wholly unacquainted, and are ignorant of each other's
necessities. Here are in a city fifty workmen in silk
and linen, and a thousand customers; and these two
ranks of men, so necessary to each other, can never
rightly meet, till one man erects a shop, to which all
the workmen and all the customers repair. In this
province, grass rises in abundance: The inhabitants
abound in cheese, and butter, and cattle; but want
bread and corn, which, in a neighbouring province,
are in too great abundance for the use of the inhabi∣tants.
One man discovers this. He brings corn from
the one province, and returns with cattle; and sup∣plying
the wants of both, he is, so far, a common
benefactor. As the people increase in numbers and
industry, the difficulty of their intercourse increases;
The business of the agency or merchandize becomes
more intricate; and divides, subdivides, compounds,
and mixes to a greater variety. In all these transac∣tions,
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
'tis necessary, and reasonable, that a conside∣rable
part of the commodities and labour should be∣long
to the merchant, to whom, in a great measure,
they are owing. And these commodities he will some∣times
preserve in kind, or more commonly convert
into money, which is their common representation.
If gold and silver have increased in the state together
with the industry, it will require a great quantity of
these metals to represent a great quantity of commo∣dities
and labour. If industry alone has increased,
the prices of every thing must sink, and a very small
quantity of specie will serve as a representation.</P>
<P>THERE is no craving or demand of the human
mind more constant and insatiable than that for exer∣cise
and employment; and this desire seems the foun∣dation
of most of our passions and pursuits. Deprive
a man of all business and serious occupation, he runs
restless from one amusement to another; and the
weight and oppression which he feels from idleness,
is so great, that he forgets the ruin which must fol∣low
from his immoderate expences. Give him a
more harmless way of employing his mind or body,
he is satisfied, and feels no longer that insatiable thirst
after pleasure. But if the employment you give him
be profitable, especially if the profit be attached to
every particular exertion of industry, he has gain so
often in his eye, that he acquires, by degrees, a pas∣sion
for it, and knows no such pleasure as that of
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
seeing the daily increase of his fortune. And this is
the reason why trade increases frugality, and why,
among merchants, there is the same overplus of misers
above prodigals, as, among the possessors of land,
there is the contrary.</P>
<P>COMMERCE increases industry, by conveying it
readily from one member of the state to another, and
allowing none of it to perish or become useless. It
increases frugality, by giving occupation to men, and
employing them in the arts of gain, which soon en∣gage
their affection, and remove all relish for pleasure
and expence. 'Tis an infallible consequence of all
industrious professions, to beget frugality, and make
the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure.
Among lawyers and physicians who have any practice,
there are many more who live within their income,
than who exceed it, or even live up to it. But law∣yers
and physicians beget no industry; and 'tis even
at the expence of others they acquire their riches;
so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some
of their fellow-citizens as fast as they increase their
own. Merchants, on the contrary, beget industry,
by serving as canals to convey it thro' every corner of
the state; and at the same time, by their frugality,
they acquire great power over that industry, and col∣lect
a large property in the labour and commodities,
which they are the chief instruments in producing.
There is no other profession, therefore, except mer∣chandize,
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
which can make the monied interest con∣siderable,
or, in other words, can increase industry,
and, by also increasing frugality, give a great com∣mand
of that industry to particular members of the
society. Without commerce, the state must consist
chiefly of landed gentry, whose prodigality and ex∣pence
make a continual demand for borrowing; and
of peasants, who have no sums to supply that demand.
The money never gathers into large stocks or sums,
which can be lent at interest. It is dispersed into
numberless hands, who either squander it in idle
show and magnificence, or employ it in the purchase
of the common necessaries of life. Commerce alone
assembles it into considerable sums; and this effect it
has merely from the industry which it begets, and the
frugality which it inspires, independent of that parti∣cular
quantity of precious metal which may circulate
in the state.</P>
<P>THUS an increase of commerce, by a necessary
consequence, raises a great number of lenders, and
by that means produces a lowness of interest. We
must now consider how far this increase of commerce
diminishes the profits arising from that profession, and
gives rise to the <HI>third</HI> circumstance requisite to pro∣duce
a lowness of interest.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to observe on this head, that
low interest and low profits of merchandize are two
<PB N="74" REF="77"/>
events, that mutually forward each other, and are
both originally derived from that extensive commerce,
which produces opulent merchants, and renders the
monied interest considerable. Where merchants pos∣sess
great stocks, whether represented by few or many
pieces of metal, it must frequently happen, that when
they either become tired of business, or have heirs
unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce, a great
deal of these riches naturally seeks an annual and se∣cure
revenue. The plenty diminishes the price, and
makes the lenders accept of a low interest. This con∣sideration
obliges many to keep their stocks in trade,
and rather be content with low profit than dispose of
their money at an under value. On the other hand,
when commerce has become very extensive, and em∣ploys
very large stocks, there must arise rivalships
among the merchants, which diminish the profits of
trade, at the same time that they increase the trade
itself. The low profits of merchandize induce the
merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest,
when they leave off business, and begin to indulge
themselves in ease and indolence. It is needless, there∣fore,
to enquire which of these circumstances, <HI>viz. low
interests or low profits,</HI> is the cause, and which the effect?
They both arise from an extensive commerce, and mu∣tually
forward each other. No man will accept of low
profits, where he can have high interest; and no man
will accept of low interest, where he can have high
profits. An extensive commerce, by producing large
ftocks, diminishes both interest and profit; and is al∣ways
<PB N="75" REF="78"/>
assisted, in its diminution of the one, by the
proportional sinking of the other. I may add, that
as low profits arise from the increase of commerce and
industry, they serve in their turn to the farther in∣crease
of commerce, by rendering the commodities
cheaper, encouraging the consumption, and heighten∣ing
the industry. And thus, if we consider the whole
connection of causes and effects, interest is the true
barometer of the state, and its lowness is a sign al∣most
infallible of the flourishing of a people. It proves
the increase of industry, and its prompt circulation
thro' the whole state, little inferior to a demonstration,
And tho', perhaps, it may not be impossible but a
sudden and a great check to commerce may have a
momentary effect of the same kind, by throwing so
many stocks out of trade; it must be attended with
such misery and want of employment in the poor,
that, besides its short duration, it will not be possible
to mistake the one case for the other.</P>
<P>THOSE who have asserted, that the plenty of mo∣ney
was the cause of low interest, seem to have taken
a collateral effect for a cause; since the same industry
which sinks the interest, does commonly acquire great
abundance of the precious metals, A variety of fine
manufactures, with vigilant enterprising merchants,
will soon draw money to a state, if it be any where
to be found in the world. The same cause, by multi∣plying
the conveniencies of life, and increasing in∣dustry,
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
collects great riches into the hands of per∣sons,
who are not proprietors of land, and produces
by that means a lowness of interest. But tho' both
these effects, plenty of money and low interest, natu∣rally
arise from commerce and industry, they are al∣together
independent of each other. For suppose a
nation removed into the <HI>Pacific</HI> ocean, without any
foreign commerce, or any knowledge of navigation:
Suppose, that this nation possesses always the same
stock of coin, but is continually increasing in its num∣bers
and industry: 'Tis evident, that the price of
every commodity must gradually diminish in that king∣dom;
since 'tis the proportion between money and any
species of goods, which fixes their mutual value; and,
upon the present supposition, the conveniencies of life
become every day more abundant, without any alte∣ration
on the current specie. A less quantity of mo∣ney,
therefore, amongst this people, will make a rich
man, during the times of industry, than would serve
to that purpose, in ignorant and slothful ages. Less
money will build a house, portion a daughter, buy an
estate, support a manufactory, or maintain a family
and equipage. These are the uses for which men bor∣row
money; and therefore, the greater or less quan∣tity
of it in a state has no influence on the interest.
But 'tis evident, that the greater or less stock of labour
and commodities must have a great insluence; since
we really and in effect borrow these, when we take
money upon interest. 'Tis true, when commerce is ex∣tended
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
all over the globe, the most industrious nations
always abound most with the precious metals: So
that low interest and plenty of money are in fact al∣most
inseparable. But still 'tis of consequence to know
the principle whence any phaenomenon arises, and to
distinguish betwixt a cause and a concomitant effect.
Besides that the speculation is curious, it may fre∣quently
be of use in the conduct of public affairs. At
least, it must be owned, that nothing can be of more
use than to improve, by practice, the method of rea∣soning
on these subjects, which of all others are the
most important; tho' they are commonly treated in
the loosest and most careless manner.</P>
<P>ANOTHER reason of this popular mistake with re∣gard
to the cause of low interest, seems to be the in∣stance
of some nations; where, after a sudden acqui∣sition
of money, or of the precious metals, by means
of foreign conquest, the interest has fallen, not only
among them, but in all the neighbouring states, as
soon as that money was dispersed, and had insinuated
itself into every corner. Thus, interest in SPAIN fell
near a half immediately after the discovery of the
WEST INDIES, as we are informed by GARCILASSO
DE LA VEGA: And it has been ever since gradually
sinking in every kingdom of EUROPE. Interest in
ROME, after the conquest of EGYPT, fell from 6 to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>per cent.</HI> as we learn from DION<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81"/>
THE causes of the sinking of interest upon such an
event, seem different in the conquering country and
in the neighbouring states; but in neither of them
can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the increase
of gold and silver.</P>
<P>IN the conquering country, 'tis natural to imagine,
that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few
hands, and be gathered into large sums, which seek
a secure revenue, either by the purchase of land or by
interest; and consequently the same effect follows, for
a little time, as if there had been a great accession of
industry and commerce. The increase of lenders
above the borrowers sinks the interest; and so much
the faster, if those who have acquired those large
sums, find no industry or commerce in the state, and
no method of employing their money but by lending
it at interest. But after this new mass of gold and
silver has been digested, and has circulated thro' the
whole state, affairs will soon return to their former
situation: while the landlords and new money-hold∣ers,
living idly, squander above their income; and
the former daily contract debt, and the latter incroach
on their stock till its final extinction. The whole mo∣ney
may still be in the state, and make itself felt by
the increase of prices: But not being now collected
into any large masses or stocks, the disproportion be∣tween
the borrowers and lenders is the same as for∣merly,
and consequently the high interest returns.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82"/>
ACCORDINGLY we find, in ROME, that so early
as TIBERIUS'S time, interest had again mounted to
6 <HI>per cent.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COLUMELLA, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE> tho' no accident had happened to drain
the empire of money. In TRAJAN'S time, money
lent on mortgages in ITALY, bore 6 <HI>per cent</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLINII epist. lib. 7. ep. 18.</NOTE>; on
common securities in BITHYNIA, 12<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 10. ep. 62.</NOTE>. And if in∣terest
in SPAIN has not risen to its old pitch; this can
be ascribed to nothing but the continuance of the same
cause that sunk it, <HI>viz.</HI> the large fortunes continually
made in the INDIES, which come over to SPAIN from
time to time, and supply the demand of the bor∣rowers.
By this accidental and extraneous cause,
more money is to be lent in SPAIN, that is, more mo∣ney
is collected into large sums, than would otherwise
be found in a state, where there are so little commerce
and industry.</P>
<P>AS to the reduction of interest, which has followed
in ENGLAND, FRANCE, and other kingdoms of EU∣ROPE,
that have no mines, it has been gradual; and
has not proceeded from the increase of money, con∣sidered
merely in itself; but from the increase of in∣dustry,
which is the natural effect of the former in∣crease,
in that interval, before it raises the price of
labour and provisions. For to return to the foregoing
supposition; if the industry of ENGLAND had risen
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
as much from other causes, (and that rise might easily
have happened, tho' the stock of money had remained
the same) must not all the same consequences have
followed, which we observe at present? The same
people would, in that case, be found in the kingdom,
the same commodities, the same industry, manufac∣tures,
and commerce; and consequently the same
merchants, with the same stocks, that is, with the
same command over labour and commodities, only
represented by a smaller number of white or yellow
pieces; which being a circumstance of no moment,
would only affect the waggoner, porter, and trunk∣maker.
Luxury, therefore, manufactures, arts, in∣dustry,
frugality, flourishing equally as at present, 'tis
evident that interest must also have been as low; since
that is the necessary result of all these circumstances;
so far as they determine the profits of commerce, and
the proportion between the borrowers and lenders in
any state.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the BALANCE of TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>'TIS very usual, in nations ignorant of the na∣ture
of commerce, to prohibit the exportation
of commodities, and to preserve among themselves
whatever they think valuable and useful. They con∣sider
not, that, in this prohibition, they act directly
contrary to their intention; and that the more is ex∣ported
of any commodity, the more will be raised at
home, of which they themselves will always have
the first offer.</P>
<P>'TIS well known to the learned, that the antient
laws of ATHENS rendered the exportation of figs cri∣minal;
that being supposed a species of fruit so ex∣cellent
in ATTICA, that the ATHENIANS esteemed it
too delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in
this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in ear∣nest,
that reformers were thence called <HI>sycophants</HI>
among them, from two GREEK words, which signify
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
<HI>figs</HI> and <HI>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scoverer</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>PLUT.</HI> De curiositate.</NOTE>. There are proofs in many old
acts of the SCOTCH parliament of the same igno∣rance
in the nature of commerce. And to this day,
in FRANCE, the exportation of corn is almost al∣ways
prohibited; in order, as they say, to prevent
famines; tho' 'tis evident, that nothing contributes
more to the frequent famines which so much distress
that fertile country.</P>
<P>THE same jealous fear, with regard to money, has
also prevailed among several nations; and it required
both reason and experience to convince any people,
that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than
to raise the exchange against them, and produce a still
greater exportation.</P>
<P>THESE errors, one may say, are gross and palpable:
But there still prevails, even in nations well acquainted
with commerce, a strong jealousy with regard to the
balance of trade, and a fear, that all their gold and
silver may be leaving them. This seems to me, al∣most
in every case, a very groundless apprehension;
and I should as soon dread, that all our springs and
rivers should be exhausted, as that money should aban∣don
a kingdom where there are people and industry.
Let us carefully preserve these latter advantages; and
we need never be apprehensive of losing the former.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86"/>
'TIS easy to observe, that all calculations concern∣ing
the balance of trade are founded on very uncer∣tain
facts and suppositions. The customhouse-books
are owned to be an insufficient ground of reasoning;
nor is the rate of exchange much better; unless we
consider it with all nations, and know also the pro∣portions
of the several sums remitted; which one may
safely pronounce impossible. Every man who has
ever reasoned on this subject, has always proved his
theory, whatever it was, by facts and calculations,
and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent to
all foreign kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE writings of Mr. GEE struck the nation with
an universal panic, when they saw it plainly demon∣strated,
by a detail of particulars, that the balance was
against them for so considerable a sum as must leave
them without a single shilling in five or six years. But,
luckily, twenty years have since elapsed, with an ex∣pensive
foreign war; and yet it is commonly supposed,
that money is still more plentiful among us than in
any former period.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more entertaining on this head
than Dr. SWIFT; an author so quick in discerning
the mistakes or absurdities of others. He says, in his
<HI>short view of the state of</HI> IRELAND, that the whole
cash of that kingdom amounted but to 500,000 <HI>l.;</HI>
that out of this they remitted every year a neat mil∣lion
<PB N="84" REF="87"/>
to ENGLAND, and had scarce any other source
from which they could compensate themselves, and
little other foreign trade but the importation of
FRENCH wines, for which they paid ready money.
The consequence of this situation, which must be
owned disadvantageous, was, that in a course of three
years, the current money of IRELAND, from <HI>500,000l.</HI>
was reduced to less than two. And at present, I sup∣pose,
in a course of near 30 years, it is absolutely
nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the
advance of riches in IRELAND, which gave the Doc∣tor
so much indignation, seems still to continue, and
gain ground with every body.</P>
<P>IN short, this apprehension of the wrong balance
of trade, appears of such a nature, that it discovers
itself, where-ever one is out of humour with the mi∣nistry,
or is in low spirits; and as it can never be re∣futed
by a particular detail of all the exports, which
counterbalance the imports, it may here be proper to
form a general argument, which may prove the im∣possibility
of that event, as long as we preserve our
people and our industry.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE four fifths of all the money in BRITAIN
to be annihilated in one night, and the nation reduced
to the same condition, with regard to specie, as in the
reigns of the HARRYS and EDWARDS, what would
be the consequence? Must not the price of all labour
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
and commodities sink in proportion, and every thing
be sold as cheap as they were in those ages? What
nation could then dispute with us in any foreign mar∣ket,
or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at
the same price, which to us would afford sufficient
profit? In how little time, therefore, must this bring
back the money which we had lost, and raise us to
the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where,
after we have arrived, we immediately lose the ad∣vantage
of the cheapness of labour and commodities;
and the farther flowing in of money is stopped by our
fuiness and repletion.</P>
<P>AGAIN, suppose, that all the money in BRITAIN
were multiplied fivefold in a night, must not the con∣trary
effect follow? Must not all labour and commo∣dities
rise to such an exorbitant height, that no neigh∣bouring
nations could afford to buy from us; while
their commodities, on the other hand, became so
cheap in comparison, that, in spite of all the laws
which could be formed, they would be run in upon
us, and our money flow out; till we fall to a level
with foreigners, and lose that great superiority of riches,
which had laid us under such disadvantages?</P>
<P>NOW, 'tis evident, that the same causes which
would correct these exorbitant inequalities, were
they to happen miraculously, must prevent their hap∣pening
in the common course of nature, and must for
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
ever in all the neighbouring nations, preserve money
nearly proportionable to the art and industry of each
nation. All water, where-ever it communicates, re∣mains
always at a level. Ask naturalists the reason;
they tell you, that were it to be raised in any one
place, the superior gravity of that part not being ba∣lanced,
must depress it, till<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>it meets a counterpoise;
and that the same cause which redresses the inequality
when it happens, must for ever prevent it, without
some violent external operation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is another cause, tho' more limited in its operation, which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every particular nation to which the kingdom trades. When we import more goods than we export, the exchange turns against us, and this becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the charge of carriage and insurance of the money which becomes due would amount to. For the exchange can never rise higher than that sum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CAN one imagine, that it had ever been possible,
by any laws, or even by any art or industry, to have
kept all the money in SPAIN, which the galleons have
brought from the INDIES? or that all commodities
could be sold in FRANCE for a tenth of the price
which they would yield on the other side of the PY∣RENEES,
without finding their way thither, and drain∣ing
from that immense treasure? What other reason,
indeed, is there, why all nations, at present, gain in
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
their trade with SPAIN and PORTUGAL; but because
it is impossible to heap up money, more than any fluid,
beyond its proper level? The sovereigns of these
countries have shown, that they wanted not inclina∣tion
to keep their gold and silver to themselves, had
it been in any degree practicable.</P>
<P>BUT as any body of water may be raised above the
level of the surrounding element, if the former has
no communication with the latter; so in money, if
the communication be cut off, by any material or phy∣sical
impediment, (for all laws alone are ineffectual)
there may, in such a case, be a very great inequality
of money. Thus the immense distance of CHINA,
together with the monopolies of our INDIA compa∣nies,
obstructing the communication, preserve in EU∣ROPE
the gold and silver, especially the latter, in
much greater plenty than they are found in that king∣dom.
But, notwithstanding this great obstruction,
the force of the causes above-mentioned is still evident.
The skill and ingenuity of EUROPE in general surpasses
perhaps that of CHINA, with regard to manual arts
and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade
thither without great disadvantage. And were it not
for the continual recruits which we receive from
AMERICA, money would very soon sink in EUROPE,
and rise in CHINA, till it came nearly to a level in
both places. Nor can any reasonable man doubt,
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
but that industrious nation, were they as near us as
POLAND or BARBARY, would drain us of the over-plus
of our specie, and draw to themselves a larger
share of the WEST-INDIAN treasures. We need have
no recourse to a physical attraction, to explain the ne∣cessity
of this operation. There is a moral attraction,
arising from the interests and passions of men, which
is full as potent and infallible.</P>
<P>How is the balance kept in the provinces of every
kingdom among themselves, but by the force of this
principle, which makes it impossible for money to
lose its level, and either to rise or sink beyond the
proportion of the labour and commodities which is
in each province? Did not long experience make
people easy on this head, what a fund of gloomy re∣flections
might calculations afford a melancholy YORK∣SHIREMAN,
while he computed and magnified the
sums drawn to LONDON by taxes, absentees, commo∣dities,
and found on comparison the opposite articles
so much inferior? And no doubt, had the <HI>Heptarchy</HI>
subsisted in ENGLAND, the legislature of each state
had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong
balance; and as 'tis probable that the mutual hatred
of these states would have been extremely violent on
account of their close neighbourhood, they would
have loaded and oppressed all commerce, by a jealous
and superfluous caution. Since the union has removed
the barriers between SCOTLAND and ENGLAND, which
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
of these nations gains from the other by this free
commerce? Or if the former kingdom has received
any increase of riches, can it be reasonably accounted
for by any thing but the increase of its art and in∣dustry?
It was a common apprehension in ENGLAND,
before the union, as we learn from L'ABBE DU BOS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Les interets d' <HI>ANGLETERRE</HI> mal-entendus.</NOTE>,
that SCOTLAND would soon drain them of their trea∣sure,
were an open trade allowed; and on the other
side the TWEED a contrary apprehension prevailed:
With what justice in both, time has shown.</P>
<P>WHAT happens in small protions of mankind, must
take place in greater. The provinces of the ROMAN
empire, no doubt, kept their balance with each other,
and with ITALY, independant of the legislature; as
much as the several counties of BRITAIN, or the se∣veral
parishes of each county. And any man who
travels over EUROPE at this day, may see by the prices
of commodities, that money, in spite of the absurd
jealousy of princes and states, has brought itself nearly
to a level; and that the difference between one king∣dom
and another is not greater in this respect, than it
is often between different provinces of the same king∣dom.
Men naturally <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock to capital cities, sea-ports,
and navigable rivers. There we find more men, more
industry, more commodities, and consequently more
<PB N="90" REF="93"/>
money; but still the latter difference holds proportion
with the former, and the level is preserved<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It must carefully be remarked, that, thro' out this discourse, where-ever I speak of the level of money, I mean always its pro∣portional level to the commodities, labour, industry, and skill, which is in the several states. And I assert, that where these advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what they are in the neighbouring states, the money infallibly will also be double, triple, quadruple. The only circumstance that can obstruct the exactness of these proportions, is the expence of transporting the commodities from one place to another; and this expence is sometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle, cheese, butter, of DEREYSHIRE, cannot draw the money of LONDON, so much as the manufactures of LONDON draw the money of DERBY∣SHIRE. But this objection is only a seeming one: For so far as the transport of commodities is expensive, so far is the commu∣nication between the place obstructed and imperfect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR jealousy and our hatred of FRANCE, are with∣out
bounds; and the former sentiment, at least, must
be acknowledged very reasonable and well-grounded.
These passions have occasioned innumerable barriers
and obstructions upon commerce, where we are ac∣cused
of being commonly the aggressors. But what
have we gained by the bargain? We lost the FRENCH
market for our woollen manufactures, and transferred
the commerce of wine to SPAIN and PORTUGAL,
where we buy much worse liquor at a higher price.
There are few ENGLISHMEN who would not think
<PB N="91" REF="94"/>
their country absolutely ruined, were FRENCH wines
sold in ENGLAND so cheap and in such abundance as
to supplant, in some measure, all ale, and home-brewed
liquors: But would we lay aside prejudice,
it would not be difficult to prove, that nothing could
be more innocent, perhaps advantageous. Each new
acre of vineyard planted in FRANCE, in order to sup∣ply
ENGLAND with wine, would make it requisite for
the FRENCH to take the product of an ENGLISH acre,
sown in wheat or barley, in order to subsist themselves;
and 'tis evident, that we have thereby got command
of the better commodity.</P>
<P>THERE are many edicts of the FRENCH King, pro∣hibiting
the planting of new vineyards, and ordering
all those already planted to be grubbed up: So sensible
are they in that country, of the superior value of corn,
above every other product.</P>
<P>MARESCHAL VAUBAN complains often, and with
reason, of the absurd duties which load the entry of
those wines of LANGUEDOC, GU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>NNE, and other
southern provinces, that are imported into BRITANY
and NORMANDY. He entertained no doubt but
these latter provinces could preserve their balance,
notwithstanding the open commerce which he recom∣mends.
And 'tis evident, that a few leagues more
navigation to ENGLAND would make no difference;
<PB N="92" REF="95"/>
or if it did, that it must operate alike on the commo∣dities
of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed one expedient by which it is pos∣sible
to sink, and another by which we may raise,
money beyond its natural level in any kingdom; but
these cases, when examined, will be found to resolve
into our general theory, and to bring additional au∣thority
to it.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>SCARCE know any method of sinking money be∣low
its level, but those institutions of banks, funds,
and paper-credit, with which we are in this kingdom
so much infatuated. These render paper equivalent
to money, circulate it thro' the whole state, make it
supply the place of gold and silver, raise proportion∣ably
the price of labour and commodities, and by that
means either banish a great part of those precious me∣tals,
or prevent their farther increase. What can be
more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head?
We fancy, because an individual would be much
richer, were his stock of money doubled, that the
same good effect would follow were the money of
every one increased; not considering, that this would
raise as much the price of every commodity, and re∣duce
every man, in time, to the same condition as
before. 'Tis only in our public negotiations and trans∣actions
with foreigners, that a greater stock of money
is advantageous; and as our paper is there absolutely
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
insignificant, we feel, by its means, all the ill effects
arising from a great abundance of money, without
reaping any of the advantages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We observed in Essay III. that money, when increasing, gives encouragement to industry, during the interval between the increase of money and rise of the prices. A good effect of this nature may follow too from paper credit; but 'tis dangerous to precipitate matters, at the risk of losing all by the failing of that credit, as must happen upon any violent shock in public affairs.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE that there are 12 millions of paper, which
circulate in the kingdom as money, (for we are not to
imagine, that all our enormous funds are employed
in that shape), and suppose the real cash of the king∣dom
to be 18 millions: Here is a state which is found
by experience able to hold a stock of 30 millions. I
say, if it be able to hold it, it must of necessity have
acquired it in gold and silver, had we not obstructed
the entrance of these metals by this new invention of
paper. <HI>Whence would it have acquired that sum?</HI>
From all the kingdoms of the world. <HI>But why?</HI> Be∣cause,
if you remove these 12 millions, money in this
state is below its level, compared with our neighbours;
and we must immediately draw from all of them, till
we be full and saturate, so to speak, and can hold no
more. By our wise politics, we are careful to stuff
<PB N="94" REF="97"/>
the nation with this fine commodity of bank-bills and
chequer notes, as if we were afraid of being over-burthened
with the precious metals.</P>
<P>'TIS not to be doubted, but the great plenty of
bullion in FRANCE is, in a great measure, owing to
the want of paper-credit. The FRENCH have no
banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as with
us: Usury or lending on interest is not directly per∣mitted;
so that many have large sums in their coffers:
Great quantities of plate are used in private houses;
and all the churches are full of it. By this means,
provisions and labour still remain much cheaper among
them, than in nations that are not half so rich in gold
and silver. The advantages of this situation in point
of trade, as well as in great public emergencies, are
too evident to be disputed.</P>
<P>THE same fashion a few years ago prevailed in GE∣NOA,
which still has place in ENGLAND and HOLLAND,
of using services of CHINA ware instead of
plate; but the senate, wisely soreseeing the conse∣quence,
prohibited the use of that brittle commodity
beyond a certain extent; while the use of silver plate
was left unlimited. And I suppose, in their late dis∣tresses,
they selt the good effect of this ordinance.
Our tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view, somewhat
impolitic.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="98"/>
BEFORE the introduction of paper-money into our
colonies, they had gold and silver sufficient for their
circulation. Since the introduction of that commo∣dity,
the least inconveniency that has followed is the
total banishment of the precious metals. And after
the abolition of paper, can it be doubted but money
will return, while these colonies possess manufactures
and commodities, the only thing valuable in com∣merce,
and for whose sake alone all men desire mo∣ney?</P>
<P>WHAT
pity LYCURCUS did not think of paper-credit,
when he wanted to banish gold and silver from
SPARTA! It would have served his purpose better
than the lumps of iron he made use of as money;
and would also have prevented more effectually all
commerce with strangers, as being of so much less
real and intrinsic value.</P>
<P>BUT as our darling projects of paper-credit are per∣nicious,
being almost the only expedient by which
we can sink money below its level; so, in my opi∣nion,
the only expedient by which we can raise mo∣ney
above its level, is a practice which we should all
exclaim against as destructive, <HI>viz.</HI> the gathering large
sums into a public treasure, locking them up, and
absolutely preventing their circulation. The fluid, not
communicating with the neighbouring element, may,
by such an artifice, be raised to what height we please.
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
To prove this, we need only return to our first sup∣position,
of the annihilating the half or any part of
our cash; where we found, that the immediate con∣sequence
of such an event would be the attraction of
an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms.
Nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set,
by the nature of things, to this practice of hoarding.
A small city, like GENEVA, continuing this policy
for ages, might ingross nine tenths of the money of
EUROPE. There seems, indeed, in the nature of
man, an invincible obstacle to that immense growth
of riches. A weak state, with an enormous treasure,
would soon become a prey to some of its poorer, but
more powerful neighbours. A great state would dis∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pate
its wealth on dangerous and ill-concerted pro∣jects;
and probably destroy, with it, what is much
more valuable, the industry, morals, and numbers of
its people. The fluid in this case, raised to too great
a height, bursts and destroys the vessel that contains
it; and mixing itself with the surrounding element,
soon falls to its proper level.</P>
<P>So little are we commonly acquainted with this
principle, that tho' all historians agree in relating uni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ormly
so recent an event, as the immense treasure
amassed by HARRY VII. (which they make amount
to 1,700,000 pounds,) we rather reject their concurring
testimony, than admit of a fact which agrees so ill
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
with our inveterate prejudices. 'Tis indeed probable,
that that sum might be three fourths of all the money
in ENGLAND. But where is the difficulty that such
a sum might be amassed in twenty years, by a cunning,
rapacious, frugal, and almost arbitrary monarch? Nor
is it probable, that the diminution of circulating mo∣ney
was ever sensibly felt by the people, or ever did
them any prejudice. The sinking of the prices of
all commodities would immediately replace it, by giv∣ing
ENGLAND the advantage in its commerce with all
the neighbouring kingdoms.</P>
<P>HAVE we not an instance in the small republic of
ATHENS with its allies, who in about fifty years be∣tween
the MEDIAN and PELOPONNESIAN wars, a∣massed
a sum greater than that of HARRY VII.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were about eight ounces of silver in a pound <HI>Sterling</HI> in HARRY VII.'s time.</NOTE>?
For all the GREEK historians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">THUCYDIDES, lib. 2. and D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>OD. SIC. lib. 12.</NOTE> and orators<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid.</HI> AESCHINIS <HI>et</HI> DEMOSTHENIS <HI>epist.</HI></NOTE> agree,
that the ATHENIANS collected in the citadel more
than 10,000 talents, which they afterwards dissipated
to their own ruin, in rash and imprudent enterprizes.
But when this money was set a-running, and began
to communicate with the surrounding fluid; what was
the consequence? Did it remain in the state? No.
For we find by the memorable <HI>census</HI> mentioned by
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
DEMOSTHENES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/></NOTE>. and POLYBIUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 62.</NOTE>, that, in about
fifty years afterwards, the whole value of the repub∣lic,
comprehending lands, houses, commodities, slaves,
and money, was less than 6000 talents.</P>
<P>WHAT an ambitious high-spirited people was this,
to collect and keep in their treasury, with a view to
conquests, a sum, which it was every day in the power
of the citizens, by a single vote, to distribute among
themselves, and which would go near to triple the
riches of every individual! For we must observe, that
the numbers and private riches of the ATHENIANS
are said by ancient writers to have been no greater
at the beginning of the PELOPONNESIAN war, than at
the beginning of the MACEDONIAN.</P>
<P>MONEY was little more plentiful in GREECE
during the age of PHILIP and PERSEUS, than in
ENGLAND during that of HARRY VII.: Yet these
two monarchs in thirty years<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII, lib. 45. cap. 40.</NOTE> collected from the
small kingdom of MACEDON, a much larger treasure
than that of the ENGLISH monarch. PAULUS AEMI∣LIUS
brought to ROME about 1,700,000 pounds <HI>Ster∣ling</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">VEL. PATERC. lib. 1. cap. 9.</NOTE>. PLINY says 2,400,000<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 33. cap. 3.</NOTE>. And that was but a
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
part of the MACEDONIAN treasure. The rest was
dissipated by the resistance and flight of PERSEUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII, <HI>ibid.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WE may learn from STANYAN, that the canton of
BERNE had 300,000 pounds lent at interest, and had
above six times as much in their treasury. Here then
is a sum hoarded of 1,800,000 pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI>
which is at least quadruple of what should naturally
circulate in such a petty state; and yet no one who
travels into the PAIS DE VAUX, or any part of that
canton, observes any want of money more than could
be supposed in a country of that extent, soil, and
situation. On the contrary, there are scarce any in∣land
provinces in the continent of FRANCE or GER∣MANY,
where the inhabitants are at this time so opu∣lent,
tho' that canton has vastly increased its treasure
since 1714, the time when STANYAN wrote his judi∣cious
account of SWITZERLAND<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The poverty which STANYAN speaks of is only to be seen in the most mountainous cantons, where there is no commodity to bring money: And even there the people are not poorer than in the diocess of SALTZBURG on the one hand, or SAVOY on the other.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE account given by APPIAN<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Proem.</NOTE> of the treasure
of the PTOLOMIES, is so prodigious, that one cannot
admit of it; and so much the less, that the historian
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
says, the other successors of ALEXANDER were also
frugal, and had many of them treasures not much
inferior. For this saving humour of the neighbouring
princes must necessarily have checked the frugality of
the AEGYPTIAN monarchs, according to the forego∣ing
theory. The sum he mentions is 740,000 talents,
or 191,166,666 pounds 13 shillings and 4 pence, ac∣cording
to Dr. ARBUTHNOT'S computation. And
yet APPIAN says, that he extracted his account from
the public records; and he was himself a native of
ALEXANDRIA.</P>
<P>FROM these principles we may learn what judg∣ment
we ought to form of those numberless bars, ob∣structions,
and imposts, which all nations of EUROPE,
and none more than ENGLAND, have put upon trade;
from an exorbitant desire of amassing money, which
never will heap up beyond its level, while it circulates;
or from an ill grounded apprehension of losing their
specie, which never will sink below it. Could any
thing scatter our riches, it would be such impolitic
contrivances. But this general ill effect, however,
results from them, that they deprive neighbouring na∣tions
of that free communication and exchange, which
the author of the world has intended, by giving them
soils, climates, and geniuses, so different from each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="104"/>
OUR modern politics embrace the only method of
banishing money, the using paper-credit; they reject
the only method of amassing it, the practice of hoard∣ing;
and they adopt a hundred contrivances, which
serve to no purpose but to check industry, and rob
ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits
of art and nature.</P>
<P>ALL texes, however, upon foreign commodities,
are not to be regarded as prejudicial or useless, but
those only which are founded on the jealousy above∣mentioned.
A tax on GERMAN linen encourages
home manufactures, and thereby multiplies our people
and industry. A tax on brandy increases the sale of
rum, and supports our southern colonies. And as
'tis necessary imposts should be levied, for the support
of government, it may be thought more convenient to
lay them on foreign commodities, which can easily be
intercepted at the port, and subjected to the impost.
We ought, however, always to remember the maxim
of Dr. SWIFT, That, in the arithmetic of the cus∣toms,
two and two make not four, but often make
only one. It can scarcely be doubted, but if the
duties on wine were lowered to a third, they would
yield much more to the government than at present:
Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly
a better and more wholesome liquor; and no preju∣dice
would ensue to the balance of trade, of which
we are so jealous. The manufacture of ale, beyond
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
the agriculture, is but inconsiderable, and gives em∣ployment
to few hands. The transport of wine and
corn would not be much inferior.</P>
<P>BUT are there not frequent instances, you will say,
of states and kingdoms, which were formerly rich
and opulent, and are now poor and beggarly? Has
not the money left them, with which they formerly
abounded? I answer, If they lose their trade, in∣dustry,
and people, they cannot expect to keep their
gold and silver: For these precious metals will hold
proportion to the former advantages. When LISBON
and AMSTERDAM got the EAST-INDIA trade from VE∣NICE
and GENOA, they a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so got the profits and mo∣ney
which arose f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om it. Where the seat of govern∣ment
is transferred, where expensive armies are main∣tained
at a distance, where great funds are possessed
by foreigners; there naturally follows from these
causes a diminution of the specie. But these, we
may observe, are violent and forcible methods of car∣rying
away money, and are in time commonly at∣tended
with the transport of people and industry. But
where these remain, and the drain is not continued,
the money always finds its way back again, by a hun∣dred
canals, of which we have no notion or suspicion.
What immense treasures have been spent, by so many
nations, in FLANDERS since the revolution, in the
course of three long wars? More money perhaps
than the half of what is at present in all EUROPE.
<PB N="103" REF="106"/>
But what has now become of it? Is it in the narrow
compass of the AUSTRIAN provinces? No, surely:
It has most of it returned to the several countries
whence it came, and has followed that art and in∣dustry
by which at first it was acquired. For above a
thousand years, the money of EUROPE has been flow∣ing
to ROME, by an open and sensible current; but
it has been emptied by many secret and insensible ca∣nals:
And the want of industry and commerce ren∣ders
at present the papal dominions the poorest terri∣tory
in all ITALY.</P>
<P>IN short, a government has great reason to pre∣serve
with care its people and its manufactures. Its
money, it may safely trust to the course of human af∣fairs,
wihtout fear or jealousy. Or if it ever give at∣tention
to this latter circumstance, it ought only to be
so far as it affects the former.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the JEALOUSY of TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING endeavoured to remove one species of
ill-founded jealousy, which is so prevalent among
commercial nations, it may not be amiss to mention
another, which seems equally groundless. Nothing
is more usual, among states which have made some
advances in commerce, than to look on the progress
of their neighbours with a suspicious eye, to consider
all trading states as their rivals, and to suppose that it
is impossible for any of them to flourish, but at their
expence. In opposition to this narrow and malignant
opinion, I will venture to assert, that the increase of
riches and commerce in any one nation, instead of
hurting, commonly promotes the riches and com∣merce
of all its neighbours; and that a state can
scarcely carry its trade and industry very far, where
all the surrounding states are buried in ignorance,
sloth, and barbarism.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108"/>
IT is obvious, that the domestic industry of a
people cannot be hurt by the greatest prosperity of
their neighbours; and as this branch of commerce is
undoubtedly the most important in any extensive king∣dom,
we are so far removed from all reason of jea∣lousy.
But I go farther, and observe, that where an
open communication is preserved among nations, it
is impossible but the domestic industry of every one
must receive an increase from the improvements of
the others. Compare the situation of GREAT BRI∣TAIN
at present, with what it was two centuries ago.
All the arts both of agriculture and manufactures
were then extremely rude and imperfect. Every im∣provement
which we have since made, has arisen from
our imitation of foreigners; and we ought so far to
esteem it happy, that they had previously made ad∣vances
in arts and ingenuity. But this intercourse is
still upheld to our great advantage: Notwithstanding
the advanced state of our manufactures, we daily adopt
in every art, the inventions and improvements of our
neighbours. The commodity is first imported from
abroad, to our great discontent, while we imagine that
it drains us of our money: Afterwards, the art itself
is gradually imported, to our visible advantage: Yet
we continue still to repine, that our neighbours should
possess any art, industry, and invention; forgetting
that had they not first instructed us, we should have
been at present barbarians; and did they not still con∣tinue
their instructions, the arts must fall into a state
<PB N="107" REF="109"/>
of languor, and lose that emulation and novelty
which contribute so much to their advancement.</P>
<P>THE increase of domestic industry lays the founda∣tion
of foreign commer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. Where a great number of
commodities are raised and perfected for the home-market,
there will always be found some which can
be exported with advantage. But if our neighbours
have no art nor cultivation, they cannot take them;
because they will have nothing to give in exchange.
In this respect, states are in the same condition as
individuals. A single man can scarce be industrious,
where all his fellow-citizens are idle. The riches of
the several members of a community contribute to in∣crease
my riches, whatever profession I may follow.
They consume the product of my industry, and afford
me the product of theirs in return.</P>
<P>NOR need any state entertain apprehensions, that
their neighbours will improve to such a degree in
every art and manufacture, as to have no demand
from them. Nature, by giving a diversity of geniuses,
climates, and soils to different nations, has secured
their mutual intercourse and commerce, as long
as they all remain industrious and civilized. Nay,
the more the arts increase in any state, the more will
be its demands from its industrious neighbours. The
inhabitants having become opulent and skilful, desire
to have every commodity in the utmost perfection;
<PB N="108" REF="110"/>
and as they have plenty of commodities to give in ex∣change,
they make large importations from every
foreign nation. The industry of the nations from
whom they import it, receives encouragement: Their
own is also increased, by the sale of the commodities
which they give in exchange.</P>
<P>BUT what if a nation has any staple commodity,
such as the woollen manufacture is to England? Must
not the interfering of their neighbours in that manu∣facture
be a loss to them? I answer, that when any
commodity is denominated the staple of a kingdom,
it is supposed that that kingdom has some peculiar
and natural advantages for raising the commodity;
and if, notwithstanding these advantages, they lose
such a manufactory, they ought to blame their own
idleness, or bad government, not the industry of their
neighbours. It ought also to be considered, that by
the increase of industry among the neighbouring-na∣tions,
the consumption of every particular species of
commodity is also increased; and though foreign ma∣nufactures
interfere with us in the market, the de∣mand
for our product may still continue, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> even in∣crease.
And even should it diminish, ought the con∣sequence
to be esteemed so fatal? If the spirit of in∣dustry
be preserved, it may easily be diverted from
one branch to another; and the manufacturers of
wool, for instance, be employed in linen, silk, iron,
or any other commodities, for which there appears to
<PB N="109" REF="111"/>
be a demand. We need not apprehend, that all the
objects of industry will be exhausted, or that our ma∣nufacturers,
while they remain on an equal footing
with those of our neighbours, will be in danger of
wanting employment. The emulation among rival
nations serves rather to keep industry alive in all of
them: And any people is happier who possess a va∣riety
of manufactures, than if they enjoyed one single
great manufactory, in which they are all employed.
Their situation is less precarious, and they will feel
less sensibly those revolutions and uncertainties to
which every particular species of commerce will always
be exposed.</P>
<P>THE only commercial state which ought to dread
the improvements and industry of their neighbours,
is such a one as Holland, which enjoying no extent
of land, nor possessing any native commodity, flou∣rish
only by being the brokers, and factors, and car∣riers
of others. Such a people may naturally appre∣hend,
that as soon as the neighbouring states come
to know and pursue their interest, they will take into
their own hands the management of their affairs, and
deprive their brokers of that profit, which they for∣merly
reaped from it. But though this consequence
may naturally be dreaded, it is very long before it
takes place; and by art and industry it may be ward∣ed
for many generations, if not wholly eluded. The
advantage of superior stock and correspondence is so
great, that it is not easily overcome; and as all the
<PB N="110" REF="112"/>
transactions increase by the increase of industry in
the neighbouring states, even a people whose com∣merce
stands on this precarious basis, may at first
reap a considerable profit from the flourishing condi∣tion
of their neighbours. The Dutch, having mort∣gaged
all their revenues, make not such a figure in
political transactions as formerly; but their commerce
is surely equal to what it was in the middle of the
last century, when they were reckoned among the
great powers of Europe.</P>
<P>WERE our narrow and malignant politics to meet
with success, we should reduce all our neighbouring
nations to the same state of sloth and ignorance that
prevails in Morocco and the coast of Barbary. But
what would be the consequence? They could send
us no commodities: They could take none from us:
Our domestic commerce itself would languish for want
of emulation, example, and instruction: And we our∣selves
should soon fall into the same abject condition
to which we had reduced them. I shall therefore
venture to acknowledge, that not only as a man, but
as a British subject, I pray for the flourishing com∣merce
of Germany, Spain, Italy, and even France
itself. I am at least certain, that Great Britain, and
all these nations, would flourish more, did their sove∣reigns
and ministers adopt such enlarged and bene∣volent
sentiments towards each other.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the BALANCE of POWER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a question, whether the <HI>idea</HI> of the balance of
power be owing intirely to modern policy, or
whether the <HI>phrase</HI> only has been invented in these
latter ages? 'Tis certain, that XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. x.</NOTE>, in his
institution of CYRUS, represents the combination of
the ASIATIC powers to have arisen from a jealousy of
the increasing force of the MEDES and PERSIANS;
and tho' that elegant composition should be supposed
altogether a romance, this sentiment, ascribed by the
author to the eastern princes, is at least a proof of the
prevailing notions of antient times.</P>
<P>IN the whole politics of GREECE, the anxiety with
regard to the balance of power, is most apparent, and
is expressly pointed out to us, even by the antient
historians. THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE> represents the league
which was formed against ATHENS, and which pro∣duced
<PB N="112" REF="114"/>
the PELOPONNESIAN war, as intirely owing
to this principle. And after the decline of ATHENS,
when the THEBANS and LACEDEMONIANS disputed
for sovereignty, we find, that the ATHENIANS (as
well as many other republics) threw themselves al∣ways
into the lighter scale, and endeavoured to pre∣serve
the balance. They supported THEBES against
SPARTA, till the great victory gained by EPAMI∣NONDAS
at LEUCTRA; after which they immediately
went over to the conquered, from generosity, as they
pretended, but, in reality, from their jealousy of the
conquerors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">XENOPH. Hist. GRAEC. lib. 6. &amp; 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHOEVER will read DEMOSTHENES'S oration for
the MEGALOPOLITANS, may see the utmost refine∣ments
on this principle, which ever entered into the
head of a VENETIAN or ENGLISH speculatist. And
upon the first rise of the MACEDONIAN power, this
orator immediately discovered the danger, sounded
the alarm thro' all GREECE, and at last assembled
that confederacy under the banners of ATHENS,
which fought the great and decisive battle of CHAE∣RONEA.</P>
<P>'TIS true, the GRECIAN wars are regarded by his∣torians
as wars of emulation rather than of politics;
and each state seems to have had more in view the
honour of leading the rest, than any well-grounded
<PB N="113" REF="115"/>
hopes of authority and dominion. If we consider, in∣deed,
the small number of inhabitants in any one re∣public,
compared to the whole, the great difficulty▪
of forming sieges in those times, and the extraordi∣nary
bravery and discipline of every freeman among
that noble people; we shall conclude, that the balance
of power was of itself sufficiently secured in GREECE,
and needed not to be guarded with that caution which
may be requisite in other ages. But whether we as∣cribe
the shifting sides in all the GRECIAN republics
to <HI>jealous emulation</HI> or <HI>cautious politics,</HI> the effects
were alike, and every prevailing power was sure to
meet with a confederacy against it, and that often
composed of its former friends and allies.</P>
<P>THE same principle, call it envy or prudence,
which produced the <HI>Ostracism</HI> of ATHENS and <HI>Peta∣lism</HI>
of SYRACUSE, and expelled every citizen whose
same or power overtopped the rest; the same prin∣ciple,
I say, naturally discovered itself in foreign po∣litics,
and soon raised enemies to the leading state,
however moderate in the exercise of its authority.</P>
<P>THE PERSIAN monarch was really, in his force, a
petty prince, compared to the GRECIAN republics;
and therefore it behoved him, from views of safety
more than from emulation, to interest himself in
their quarrels, and to support the weaker side in
every contest. This was the advice given by ALCI∣BIADES
<PB N="114" REF="116"/>
to TISSAPHERNES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THUCYD. lib. 8.</NOTE>, and it prolonged near
a century the date of the PERSIAN empire; till the
neglect of it for a moment, after the first appearance
of the aspiring genius of PHILIP, brought that lofty
and frail edifice to the ground, with a rapidity of
which there are few instances in the history of man∣kind.</P>
<P>THE successors of ALEXANDER showed an infinite
jealousy of the balance of power; a jealousy founded
on true politics and prudence, and which preserved
distinct for several ages the partitions made after the
death of that famous conqueror. The fortune and
ambition of ANTIGONUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 20.</NOTE> threatened them anew
with an universal monarchy; but their combination,
and their victory at IPSUS saved them. And in after
times, we find, that as the Eastern princes considered
the GREEKS and MACEDONIANS as the only real mi∣litary
force with whom they had any intercourse, they
kept always a watchful eye over that part of the
world. The PTOLEMIES, in particular, supported
first ARATUS and the ACHAEANS, and then CLEO∣MENES
king of SPARTA, from no other view than as
a counterbalance to the MACEDONIAN monarchs.
For this is the account which POLYBIUS gives of the
EGYPTIAN politics<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117"/>
THE reason why 'tis supposed, that the antients
were intirely ignorant of the <HI>balance of power,</HI> seems
to be drawn from the ROMAN history more than the
GRECIAN; and as the transactions of the former are
generally the most familiar to us, we have thence
formed all our conclusions. It must be owned, that
the ROMANS never met with any such general combi∣nation
or confederacy against them, as might natural∣ly
be expected from their rapid conquests and declared
ambition; but were allowed peaceably to subdue
their neighbours, one after another, till they extended
their dominion over the whole known world. Not to
mention the fabulous history of their ITALIC wars;
there was, upon HANNIBAL's invasion of the ROMAN
state, a very remarkable crisi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which ought to have
called up the attention of all civilized nations. It
appeared afterwards (nor was it difficult to be observ∣ed
at the time)<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was observed by some, as appears by the speech of AGE∣LAUS of NAUPACTUM, in a general congress of GREECE. See POLYB. lib. 5. cap. 104.</NOTE> that this was a contest for universal
empire; and yet no prince or state seems to have
been in the least alarmed about the event or issue of
the quarrel. PHILIP of MACEDON remained neuter,
till he saw the victories of HANNIBAL; and then
most imprudently formed an alliance with the con∣queror,
upon terms still more imprudent. He stipu∣lated,
that he was to assist the CARTHAGINIAN state
<PB N="116" REF="118"/>
in their conquest of ITALY; after which they enga∣ged
to send over forces into GREECE, to assist him in
subduing the GRECIAN commonwealths<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII lib. 23. cap.33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE RHODIAN and ACHAEAN republics are much
celebrated by antient historians for their wisdom and
found policy; yet both of them assisted the ROMANS
in their wars against PHILIP and ANTIOCHUS. And
what may be esteemed still a stronger proof, that this
maxim was not familiarly known in those ages; no
antient author has ever remarked the imprudence of
these measures, nor has even blamed that absurd trea∣ty
above mentioned, made by PHILIP with the CAR∣THAGINIANS.
Princes and statesmen may in all ages
be blinded in their reasonings with regard to events,
beforehand: But 'tis somewhat extraordinary, that
historians, afterwards, should not form a sounder
judgment of them.</P>
<P>MASSINISSA, ATTALUS, PRUSIAS, in satisfying
their private passions, were, all of them, the instru∣ments
of the ROMAN greatness; and never seem to
have suspected, that they were forging their own
chains, while they advanced the conquests of their
ally. A simple treaty and agreement between MASSI∣NISSA
and the CARTHAGINIANS, so much required
by mutual interest, barred the ROMANS from all en∣trance
<PB N="117" REF="119"/>
into AFRICA, and preserved liberty to man∣kind.</P>
<P>THE only prince we meet with in the ROMAN his∣tory,
who seems to have understood the balance of
power, is HIERO king of SYRACUSE. Tho' the
ally of ROME, he sent assistance to the CARTHAGI∣NIANS,
during the war of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>auxiliaries: “Esteem∣ing
it requisite,” says POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 83.</NOTE>, “both in
order to retain his dominions in SICILY, and to
preserve the ROMAN friendship, that CARTHAGE
should be sase; lest by its fall the remaining power
should be able, without contrast or opposition, to
execute every purpose and undertaking. And
here he acted with great wisdom and prudence.
For that is never, on any account, to be overlook∣ed;
nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into
one hand, as to incapacitate the neighbouring
states from defending their rights against it.” Here
is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express
terms.</P>
<P>IN short, the maxim of preserving the balance of
power is founded so much on common sense and ob∣vious
reasoning, that 'tis impossible it could altogether
have escaped antiquity, where we find, in other par∣ticulars,
so many marks of deep penetration and dis∣cernment.
If it was not so generally known and ac∣knowledged
<PB N="118" REF="120"/>
as at present, it had, at least an influence
on all the wiser and more experienced princes and po∣liticians.
And indeed, even at present, however ge∣nerally
known and acknowledged among speculative
reasoners, it has not, in practice, an authority much
more extensive among those who govern the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the fall of the ROMAN empire, the form
of government established by the northern conquer∣ors,
incapacitated them, in a great measure, from far∣ther
conquests, and long maintained each state in its
proper boundaries. But when vassalage and the feu∣dal
militia were abolished, mankind were anew a∣larmed
by the danger of universal monarchy, from
the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in
the person of the emperor CHARLES. But the power
of the house of AUSTRIA, founded on extensive but
divided dominions, and their riches, derived chiefly
from mines of gold and silver, were more likely to
decay, of themselves, from internal defects, than to
overthrow all the bulwarks raised against them. In
less than a century, the force of that violent and
haughty race was shattered, their opulence dissipated,
their splendour eclipsed. A new power succeeded,
more formidable to the liberties of EUROPE, posses∣sing
all the advantages of the former, and labouring
under none of its defects; except a share of that spi∣rit
of bigotry and persecution, with which the house
<PB N="119" REF="121"/>
of AUSTRIA were so long, and still are so much in∣fatuated.</P>
<P>EUROPE
has now, for above a century, remained
on the defensive against the greatest force that ever,
perhaps, was formed by the civil or political combina∣tion
of mankind. And such is the influence of the
maxim here treated of, that tho' that ambitious na∣tion,
in the five last general wars, have been victor∣ious
in four<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those concluded by the peace of the PYRENEES, NIME∣GUEN, RYSWICK, and AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</NOTE>, and unsuccessful only in one<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">That concluded by the peace of UTRECHT.</NOTE>, they
have not much enlarged their dominions, nor acqui∣red
a total ascendant over EUROPE. There remains
rather room to hope, that, by maintaining the resis∣tance
some time, the natural revolutious of human
affairs, together with unforeseen events and accidents,
may guard us against universal monarchy, and pre∣serve
the world from so great an evil.</P>
<P>IN the three last of these general wars, BRITAIN
has stood foremost in the glorious struggle; and she
still maintains her station, as guardian of the general
liberties of EUROPE, and patron of mankind. Beside
her advantages of riches and situation, her people are
animated with such a national spirit, and are so fully
sensible of the inestimable blessings of their govern∣ment,
that we may hope their vigour never will lan∣guish
<PB N="120" REF="122"/>
in so necessary and so just a cause. On the con∣trary,
if we may judge by the past, their passionate
ardour seems rather to require some moderation; and
they have oftener erred from a laudable excess than
from a blameable deficiency.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> place, we seem to have been more pos∣sessed
with the antient GREEK spirit of jealous emu∣lation,
than actuated with the prudent views of mo∣dern
politics. Our wars with FRANCE have been be∣gun
with justice, and even, perhaps from necessity;
but have always been too far pushed from obstinacy
and passion. The same peace which was afterwards
made at RYSWICK in 1697, was offered so early as the
ninety-two; that concluded at UTRECHT in 1712
might have been finished on as good conditions at
GERTRUYTENBERG in the eight; and we might
have given at FRANCFORT, in 1743, the same terms,
which we were glad to accept of at AIX LA-CHA∣PELLE
in the forty-eight. Here then we see, that
above half of our wars with FRANCE, and all our pub∣lic
debts, are owing more to our own imprudent ve∣hemence,
than to the ambition of our neighbours.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>second</HI> place, we are so declared in our op∣position
to FRENCH power, and so alert in defence of
our allies, that they always reckon upon our force as
upon their own; and expecting to carry on war at
our expence, refuse all reasonable terms of accommo∣dation.
<PB N="121" REF="123"/>
<HI>Habent subjectos, tanquam suos; viles, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
alienos.</HI> All the world knows, that the factious vote
of the House of Commons, in the beginning of the
last parliament, with the professed humour of the na∣tion,
made the queen of HUNGARY inflexible in her
terms, and prevented that agreement with PRUSSIA,
which would immediately have restored the general
tranquillity of EUROPE.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, we are such true combatants,
that, when once engaged, we lose all concern for
ourselves and our posterity, and consider only how
we may best annoy the enemy. To mortgage our re∣venues
at so deep a rate, in wars, where we were on∣ly
accessories, was surely the most fatal delusion, that a
nation, who had any pretension to politics and pru∣dence,
has ever yet been guilty of. That remedy of
funding, if it be a remedy, and not rather a poison,
ought, in all reason, to be reserved to the last extre∣mity;
and no evil, but the greatest and most urgent,
should ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an ex∣pedient.</P>
<P>THESE
excesses, to which we have been carried, are
prejudicial; and may, perhaps, in time, become still
more prejudicial another way, by begetting, as is
usual, the opposite extreme, and rendering us totally
careless and supine with regard to the fate of EUROPE. The
ATHENIANS, from the most bustling, intriguing,
<PB N="122" REF="124"/>
warlike people of GREECE, finding their error in
thrusting themselves into every quarrel, abandoned all
attention to foreign affairs; and in no contest ever
took party on either side, except by their flatteries
and complaisance to the victor.</P>
<P>ENORMOUS monarchies, such as EUROPE at pre∣sent
is threatened with, are, probably, destructive to
human nature; in their progress, in their continu∣ance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">If the ROMAN empire was of advantage, it could only pro∣ceed from this, that mankind were generally in a very disorderly, uncivilized condition, before its establishment.</NOTE>,
and even in their downfal, which never can
be very distant from their establishment. The mili∣tary
genius which aggrandized the monarchy, soon
leaves the court, the capital, and the center of such a
government; while the wars are carried on at a great
distance, and interest so small a part of the state. The
antient nobility, whose affections attach them to their
sovereign, live all at court; and never will accept of
military employments, which would carry them to
remote and barbarous frontiers, where they are dis∣tant
both from their pleasure and their fortune. The
arms of the state must, therefore, be trusted to merce∣nary
strangers, without zeal, without attachment,
without honour; ready on every occasion to turn
them against the prince, and join each desperate male-content,
who offers pay and plunder. This is the
necessary progress of human affairs: Thus human
<PB N="123" REF="125"/>
nature checks itself in its airy elevations: Thus am∣bition
blindly labours for the destruction of the con∣queror,
of his family, and of every thing near and
dear to him. The BOURBONS, trusting to the sup∣port
of their brave, faithful, and affectionate nobility,
would push their advantage, without reserve or limi∣tation.
These, while fired with glory and emulation,
can bear the fatigues and dangers of war; but never
would submit to languish in the garrisons of HUN∣GARY
or LITHUANIA, forgot at court, and sacri∣ficed
to the intrigues of every minion or mistress, who
approaches the prince. The troops are filled with
CRAVATES and TARTARS, HUSSARS and COSSACS;
intermingled, perhaps, with a few soldiers of fortune
from the better provinces: And the melancholy fate
of the ROMAN emperors, from the same cause, is re∣newed
over and over again, till the final dissolution
of the monarchy.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of TAXES.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a maxim, 'that prevails among those
whom in this country we call <HI>ways and means
men,</HI> and who are denominated <HI>Financiers</HI> and <HI>Malto∣tiers</HI>
in FRANCE, <HI>That every new tax creates a new
ability in the subject to bear it, and that each increase
of public burdens increases proportionably the industry
of the people.</HI> This maxim is of such a nature as is
most likely to be extremely abused; and is so much
the more dangerous, that its truth cannot be altoge∣ther
denied; but it must be owned, when kept within
certain bounds, to have some foundation in reason
and experience.</P>
<P>WHEN a tax is laid upon commodities, which are
consumed by the common people, the necessary con∣sequence
may seem to be, that either the poor must
retrench something from their way of living, or raise
their wages, so as to make the burden of the tax fall
intirely upon the rich. But there is a third conse∣quence,
which very often follows upon taxes, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
that the poor increase their industry, perform more
work, and live as well as before, without demanding
more for their labour. Where taxes are moderate,
are laid on gradually, and affect not the necessaries of
life, this consequence naturally follows; and 'tis cer∣tain,
that such difficulties often serve to excite the in∣dustry
of a people, and render them more opulent
and laborious, than others, who enjoy the greatest
advantages. For we may observe, as a parallel in∣stance,
that the most commercial nations have not al∣ways
possessed the greatest extent of fertile land; but,
on the contrary, that they have laboured under ma∣ny
natural disadvantage. TYRE, ATHENS, CAR∣THAGE,
RHODES, GENOA, VENICE, HOLLAND, are
strong examples to this purpose. And in all history,
we find only three instances of large and fertile coun∣tries,
which have possessed much trade; the NETHER∣LANDS,
ENGLAND, and FRANCE. The two for∣mer
seem to have been allured by the advantages of
their maritime situation and the necessity they lay un∣der
of frequenting foreign ports, in order to procure
what their own climate refused them. And as to
FRANCE, trade has come very late into that kingdom,
and seems to have been the effect of reflection and
observation in an ingenious and enterprising people,
who remarked the immense riches acquired by such
of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigation
and commerce.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="128"/>
THE places mentioned by CICERO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. ad ATT. lib. 9. ep. 11.</NOTE>, as possessed
of the greatest commerce in his time, are ALEXAN∣DRIA,
COLCHOS, TYRE, SIDON, ANDROS, CY∣PRUS,
PAMPHYLIA, LYCIA, RHODES, CHIOS, BY∣ZANTIUM,
LESBOS, SMYRNA, MILETUM, COOS.
All these, except ALEXANDRIA, were either small
islands, or narrow territories. And that city owed
its trade intirely to the happiness of its situation.</P>
<P>SINCE therefore some natural necessities or disad∣vantages
may be thought favourable to industry, why
may not artificial burdens have the same effect? Sir
WILLIAM TEMPLE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Account of the NETHERLANDS, Chap. 6.</NOTE>, we may observe, ascribes the
industry of the DUTCH intirely to necessity, proceed∣ing
from their natural disadvantages; and illustrates
his doctrine by a very striking comparison with IRE∣LAND;
“where,” says he, “by the largeness and
plenty of the soil, and scarcity of people, all things
necessary to life are so cheap, that an industrious
man, by two days labour, may gain enough to
feed him the rest of the week. Which I take to
be a very plain ground of the laziness attributed to
the people. For men naturally prefer ease before
labour, and will not take pains if they can live
idle; tho' when, by necessity, they have been in∣ured
to it, they cannot leave it, being grown a
<PB N="128" REF="129"/>
custom necessary to their health, and to their very
entertainment. Nor perhaps is the change harder,
from constant ease to labour, than from constant
labour to ease.” After which the author proceeds
to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as above,
the places where trade has most flourished, in antient
and modern times; and which are commonly observ∣ed
to be such narrow confined territories, as beget a
necessity for industry.</P>
<P>'TIS always observed, in years of scarcity, if it be
not extreme, that the poor labour more, and really
live better, than in years of great plenty, when they
indulge themselves in idleness and riot. I have been
told, by a considerable manufacturer, that in the year
1740, when bread and provisions of all kinds were
very dear, his workmen not only made a shift to live,
but paid debts, which they had contracted in former
years, that were much more favourable and abun∣dant<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">To this purpose see also Essay I. at the end.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine, therefore, with regard to taxes,
may be admitted in some degree: But beware of the
abuse. Exorbitant taxes, like extreme necessity, de∣stroy
industry, by producing despair; and even be∣fore
they reach this pitch, they raise the wages of the
labourer and manufacturer, and heighten the price of
all commodities. An attentive disinterested legislature
<PB N="129" REF="130"/>
will observe the point, when the emolument ceases,
and the prejudice begins: But as the contray cha∣racter
is much more common, 'tis to be feared that
taxes, all over EUROPE, are multiplying to such a
degree, as will intirely crush all art and industry; tho',
perhaps, their first increase, together with other cir∣cumstances,
might have contributed to the growth of
these advantages.</P>
<P>THE best taxes are such as are levied upon con∣sumptions,
especially those of luxury; because such
taxes are less felt by the people. They seem, in some
measure, voluntary; since a man may chuse how far
he will use the commodity which is taxed: They are
paid gradually and insensibly: And being confound∣ed
with the natural price of the commodity, they are
scarcely perceived by the consumers. Their only dis∣advantage
is, that they are expensive in the levying.</P>
<P>TAXES upon possessions are levied without ex∣pence;
but have every other disadvantage. Most
states, however, are obliged to have recourse to them,
in order to supply the deficiencies of the other.</P>
<P>BUT the most pernicious of all taxes are those
which are arbitrary. They are commonly converted,
by their management, into punishments on industry;
and also, by their unavoidable inequality, are more
grievous than by the real burden which they impose.
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
'Tis surprising, therefore, to see them have place
among any civilized people.</P>
<P>IN general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbitrary,
which they commonly are, may be esteemed danger∣ous:
Because it is so easy for the fovereign to add a
little more, and a little more, to the sum demanded,
that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppres∣sive
and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty up∣on
commodities checks itself; and a prince will soon
find, that an increase of the impost is no increase of
his revenue. It is not easy, therefore, for a people
to be altogether ruined by such taxes.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS inform us, that one of the chief cau∣ses
of the destruction of the ROMAN state, was the al∣teration
which CONSTANTINE introduced into the fi∣nances,
by substituting an universal poll-tax, in lieu
of almost all the tithes, customs, and excises, which
formerly composed the revenue of the <HI>empire.</HI> The
people, in all the provinces, were so grinded and op∣pressed
by the <HI>publicans,</HI> that they were glad to take
refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians;
whose dominion, as they had fewer necessities and
less art, was found preferable to the refined tyranny
of the ROMANS.</P>
<P>THERE is a prevailing opinion, that all taxes,
however levied, fall upon the land at last. Such an
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
opinion may be useful in BRITAIN, by checking the
landed gentlemen, in whose hands our legislature is
lodged, and making them preserve great regard for
trade and industry. But I must confess, that this
principle, tho' first advanced by a celebrated writer,
has so little appearance of reason, that, were it not for
his authority, it had never been received by any
body. Every man, to be sure, is desirous of pushing
off from himself the burden of any tax, which is im∣posed,
and laying it upon others: But as every man
has the same inclination, and is upon the defensive;
no set of men can be supposed to prevail altogether
in this contest. And why the landed gentleman
should be the victim of the whole, and should not be
able to defend himself, as well as others are, I can∣not
readily imagine. All tradesmen, indeed, would
willingly prey upon him, and divide him among
them, if they could: But this inclination they al∣ways
have, tho' no taxes were levied; and the same
methods, by which he guards against the imposition
of tradesmen before taxes, will serve him afterwards,
and make them share the burden with him.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this subject with observing, that
we have, with regard to taxes, an instance of what
frequently happens in political institutions, that the
consequences of things are diametrically opposite to
what we should expect on the first appearance. 'Tis
regarded as a fundamental maxim of the TURKISH
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
government, That the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> tho' absolute mas∣ter
of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no
authority to impose a new tax; and every OTTO∣MAN
prince, who has made such an attempt, either
has been obliged to retract, or has found the fatal
effects of his perseverance. One would imagine, that
this prejudice or established opinion were the firmest
barrier in the world against oppression; yet 'tis cer∣tain,
that its effect is quite contrary. The emperor,
having no regular method of increasing his revenue,
must allow all the bashaws and governors to oppress
and abuse the subjects: And these he squeezes after
their return from their government. Whereas, if he
could impose a new tax, like our EUROPEAN prin∣ces,
his interest would so far be united with that of
his people, that he would immediately feel the bad
effects of these disorderly levies of money, and would
find, that a pound, raised by general imposition,
would have less pernicious effects, than a shilling ta∣ken
in so unequal and arbitrary a manner.</P>

<P>IT appears to have been the common practice of
antiquity, to make provision, in time of peace,
for the necessities of war, and to hoard up treasures
before-hand, as the instruments either of conquest or
defence; without trusting to extraordinary imposts,
much less to borrowing, in times of disorder and con∣fusion.

<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
ALEXANDER got possession of on the conquest of
SUSA and ECBATANA, and which were reserved,
some of them, from the time of CYRUS. If I re∣member
right, the scripture also mentions the treasure
of HEZEKIAH and the JEWISH princes; as profane
history does that of PHILIP and PERSEUS, kings of
MACEDON. The antient republics of GAUL had
commonly large sums in reserve<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">STRABO, Lib, 4.</NOTE>. Every one knows
the treasure seized in ROME by JULIUS CAESAR, dur∣ing
the civil wars; and we find afterwards, that the
wiser emperors, AUGUSTUS, TIBERIUS, VESPASIAN,
SEVE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>US, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> always discovered the prudent fore∣sight,
of saving great sums against any public exi∣gency.</P>
<P>ON
the contrary, our modern expedient, which has
become very general, is to mortgage the public reve∣nues,
and to trust that posterity, during peace, will
pay off the incumbrances contracted during the pre∣ceding
war: And they having before their eyes, so
good an example of their wise fathers, have the same
prudent reliance on their posterity; who, at last, from
necessity more than choice, are obliged to place the
same confidence in a new posterity. But not to waste
time in declaiming against a practice which appears
ruinous, beyond the evidence of an hundred demon∣strations;
it seems pretty apparent, that the antient
<PB N="135" REF="136"/>
maxims are, in this respect, much more prudent than
the modern; even though the latter had been confined
within some reasonable bounds, and had ever, in any
instance, been attended with such frugality, in time
of peace, as to discharge the debts incurred by an ex∣pensive
war. For why should the case be so very dif∣ferent
between the public and an individual, as to
make us establish such different maxims of conduct for
each? If the funds of the former be greater, its
necessary expences are proportionably larger; if its
resources be more numerous, they are not infinite;
and as its frame should be calculated for a much lon∣ger
duration, than the date of a single life, or even
of a family, it should embrace maxims, large, durable,
and generous, suitable to the supposed extent of its
existence. To trust to chances and temporary ex∣pedients,
is, indeed, what the necessity of human af∣fairs
frequently reduces us to; but whoever voluntarily
depend on such resources, have not necessity, but their
own folly, to accuse for their misfortunes, when any
such befal them.</P>
<P>IF the abuses of treasures be dangerous, either by
engaging the state in rash enterprizes, or making it
neglect military discipline, in confidence of its riches;
the abuses of mortgaging are more certain and inevi∣table;
poverty, impotence, and subjection to foreign
powers.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137"/>
ACCORDING to modern policy, war is attended
with every destructive circumstance; loss of men, in∣crease
of taxes, decay of commerce, dissipation of
money, plunder by sea and land. According to an∣tient
maxims, the opening of the public treasure, as
it produced an uncommon affluence of gold and sil∣ver,
served as a temporary encouragement to industry,
and atoned, in some degree, for the inevitable cala∣mities
of war.</P>
<P>WHAT then shall we say to the new paradox, That
public incumbrances are, of themselves, advantage∣ous,
independent of the necessity of contracting them;
and that any state, even though it were not pressed by
a foreign enemy, could not possibly have embraced a
wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches,
than to create funds, and debts, and taxes, without
limitation? Discourses, such as these, might naturally
have passed for trials of wit among rhetoricians, like
the panegyrics on folly and a fever, on BUSIRIS and
NERO, had we not seen such absurd maxims patro∣nized
by great ministers, and by a whole party
among us. And these puzzling arguments, (for they
deserve not the name of specious) though they could
not be the foundation of Lord ORFORD's conduct,
for he had more sense; served at least to keep his
partizans in countenance, and perplex the understand∣ing
of the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="138"/>
LET us examine the consequences of public debts,
both in our domestic management, by their influence
on commerce and industry; and in our foreign trans∣actions,
by their effect on wars and negotiations.</P>
<P>THERE is a word, which is here in the mouth of
every body, and which, I find, has also got abroad,
and is much employed by foreign writers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MELON, DU TOT, LAW, in the pamphlets published in FRANCE.</NOTE>, in imita∣tion
of the ENGLISH; and this is, CIRCULATION.
This word serves as an account of every thing; and
though I confess, that I have sought for its meaning
in the present subject, ever since I was a school-boy,
I have never yet been able to discover it. What
possible advantage is there which the nation can reap
by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand?
Or is there any parallel to be drawn from the circula∣tion
of other commodities, to that of chequer-notes
and INDIA bonds? Where a manufacturer has a quick
sale of his goods to the merchant, the merchant to the
shopkeeper, the shopkeeper to his customers; this en∣livens
industry, and gives new encouragement to the
first dealer or the manufacturer, and all his tradesmen,
and makes them produce more and better commodi∣ties
of the same species. A stagnation is here perni∣cious,
wherever it happens; because it operates back∣wards,
and stops or benumbs the industrious hand in
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
its production of what is useful to human life. But
what production we owe to CHANGE-ALLEY, or even
what consumption, except that of coffee, and pen, ink,
and paper, I have not yet learned; nor can one fore∣see
the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce
or commodity, though that place and all its inhabi∣tants
were for ever buried in the ocean.</P>
<P>BUT though this term has never been explained by
those who insist so much on the advantages that result
from a circulation, there seems, however, to be some
benefit of a similar kind, arising from our incum∣brances:
As, indeed, what human evil is there, which
is not attended with some advantage? This we shall
endeavour to explain, that we may estimate the weight
which we ought to allow it.</P>
<P>PUBLIC securities are with us become a kind of
money, and pass as readily at the current price as
gold or silver. Where-ever any profitable undertaking
offers itself, however expensive, there are never want∣ing
hands enough to embrace it; nor need a trader,
who has sums in the public stocks, fear to launch out
into the most extensive trade; since he is possessed of
funds, which will answer the most sudden demand
that can be made upon him. No merchant thinks it
necessary to keep by him any considerable cash. Bank-stock,
or INDIA bonds, especially the latter, serve all
the same purposes; because he can dispose of them, or
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
pledge them to a banker, in a quarter of an hour;
and at the same time they are not idle, even when in
his scritoire, but bring him in a constant revenue. In
short, our national debts furnish merchants with a spe∣cies
of money, that is continually multiplying in their
hands, and produces sure gain, besides the profits of
their commerce. This must enable them to trade
upon less profit. The small profit of the merchant
renders the commodity cheaper, causes a greater con∣sumption,
quickens the labour of the common people,
and helps to spread arts and industry through the
whole society.</P>
<P>THERE are also, we may observe, in ENGLAND,
and in all states, which have both commerce and pub∣lic
debts, a set of men, who are half-merchants, half-stock-holders,
and may be supposed willing to trade
for small profits; because commerce is not their prin∣cipal
or sole support, and their revenues in the funds
are a sure resource for themselves and their families.
Were there no funds, great merchants would have no
expedient for realizing or securing any part of their
profit, but by making purchases of land; and land has
many disadvantages in comparison of funds. Requiring
more care and inspection, it divides the time and at∣tention
of the merchant; upon any tempting offer or
extraordinary accident in trade, it is not so easily con∣verted
into money; and as it attracts too much, both
<PB N="140" REF="141"/>
by the many natural pleasures it affords, and the au∣thority
it gives, it soon converts the citizen into the
country gentleman. More men, therefore, with large
stocks and incomes, may naturally be supposed to
continue in trade, where there are public debts: and
this, it must be owned, is of some advantage to com∣merce,
by diminishing its profits, promoting circula∣tion,
and encouraging industry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On this head, I shall observe, without interrupting the thread of the argument, that the multiplicity of our public debts serves rather to sink the interest, and that the more the government borrows, the cheaper may they expect to borrow; contrary to first appearance, and contrary to common opinion. The profits of trade have an influence on interest. See Essay IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, in opposition to these two favourable circum∣stances,
perhaps of no very great importance, weigh
the many disadvantages which attend our public
debts, in the whole <HI>interior</HI> oeconomy of the state:
You will find no comparison between the ill and the
good which result from them.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> 'Tis certain, that national debts cause a
mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital,
by the great sums which are levied in the provinces
to pay the interest of those debts; and perhaps, too,
by the advantages in trade above mentioned, which
they give the merchants in the capital above the rest
of the kingdom. The question is, Whether, in our
<PB N="141" REF="142"/>
case, it be for the public interest, that so many pri∣vileges
should be conferred on LONDON, which has
already arrived at such an enormous size, and seems
still increasing? Some men are apprehensive of the
consequences. For my part, I cannot forbear think∣ing,
that tho' the head is undoubtedly too big for
the body, yet that great city is so happily situated,
that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than
even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom. There
is more difference between the prices of all provisions
in PARIS and LANGUEDOC, than between those in
LONDON and YORKSHIRE.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> PUBLIC stocks, being a kind of paper-credit,
have all the disadvantages attending that spe∣cies
of money. They banish gold and silver from the
most considerable commerce of the state, reduce them
to common circulation, and by that means render all
provisions and labour dearer than otherwise they
would be.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE taxes which are levied to pay the
interests of these debts, are a check upon industry,
heighten the price of labour, and are an oppression on
the poorer sort.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As foreigners possess a share of our na∣tional
funds, they render the public, in a manner, tri∣butary
to them, and may in time occasion the trans∣port
of our people and our industry.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143"/>
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE greatest part of public stock being
always in the hands of idle people, who live on their
revenue, our funds give great encouragement to an
useless and inactive life.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the injury which arises to commerce and
industry from our public funds, will appear, upon ba∣lancing
the whole, very considerable, it is trivial, in
comparison of the prejudice which results to the state
considered as a body politic, which must support itself
in the society of nations, and have various transactions
with other states, in wars and negotiations. The ill,
there, is pure and unmixed, without any favourable
circumstance to atone for it: and 'tis an ill too of a
nature the highest and most important.</P>
<P>WE have, indeed, been told, that the public is no
weaker upon account of its debts; since they are most∣ly
due among ourselves, and bring as much property
to one as they take from another. 'Tis like transfer∣ring
money from the right hand to the left; which
leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before.
Such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will
always pass, where we judge not upon principles. I
ask, Is it possible, in the nature of things, to overbur∣then
a nation with taxes, even where the sovereign
resides among them? The very doubt seems extra∣vagant;
since 'tis requisite in every commonwealth,
that there be a certain proportion observed between
<PB N="143" REF="144"/>
the laborious and the idle part of it. But if all our
present taxes be mortgaged, must we not invent new
ones? And may not this matter be carried to a length
that is ruinous and destructive?</P>
<P>IN every nation, there are always some methods of
levying money more easy than others, suitable to the
way of living of the poeple, and the commodities
they make use of. In BRITAIN, the excises upon
malt and beer afford a very large revenue; because
the operations of malting and brewing are very tedi∣ous,
and are impossible to be concealed; and at the
same time, these commodities are not so absolutely
necessary to life, as that the raising their price would
very much affect the poorer sort. These taxes being
all mortgaged, what difficulty to find new ones! what
vexation and ruin of the poor!</P>
<P>DUTIES upon consumptions are more equal and
easy than those upon possessions. What a loss to the
public, that the former are all exhausted, and that we
must have recourse to the more grievous method of
levying taxes!</P>
<P>WERE all the proprietors of land only stewards to
the public, must not necessity force them to practise
all the arts of oppression used by stewards, where the
absence or negligence of the proprietor render them
secure against enquiry?</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145"/>
IT will scarce be asserted, that no bounds ought
ever to be set to national debts; and that the pub∣lic
would be no weaker, were twelve or fifteen shil∣lings
in the pound, land-tax, mortgaged, with all the
present customs and excises. There is something
therefore in the case, beside the mere transferring of
property from one hand to another. In 500 years,
the posterity of those now in the coaches, and of
those upon the boxes, will probably have changed
places, without affecting the public by these revo∣lutions.</P>
<P>I MUST confess, that there is a strange supineness,
from long custom, crept into all ranks of men, with
regard to public debts, not unlike what divines so ve∣hemently
complain of with regard to their religious
doctrines. We all own, that the most sanguine ima∣gination
cannot hope, either that this or any future
ministry will be possessed of such rigid and steady fru∣gality,
as to make any considerable progress in the
payment of our debts; or that the situation of fo∣reign
affairs will, for any long time, allow them lei∣sure
and tranquility for such an undertaking<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In times of peace and security, when alone it is possible to pay debt, the monied interest are averse to receive partial pay∣ments, which they know not how to dispose of to advantage; and the landed interest are averse to continue the taxes requisite for that purpose. Why therefore should a minister persevere in a measure so disagreeable to all parties? For the sake, I suppose, of a posterity, which he will never see, or of a few reasonable reflecting people, whose united interest, perhaps, will not be able to secure him the smallest burrough in ENGLAND. 'Tis not likely we shall ever find any minister so bad a politician. With regard to these narrow destructive maxims of politics, all minis∣ters are expert enough.</NOTE>. <HI>What
<PB N="145" REF="146"/>
then is to become of us?</HI> Were we ever so good Christ∣ians,
and ever so resigned to Providence; this, me∣thinks,
were a curious question, even considered as a
speculative one, and what it might not be altogether
impossible to form some conjectural solution of. The
events here will depend little upon the contingencies
of battles, negotiations, intrigues and factions. There
seems to be a natural progress of things, which may
guide our reasoning. As it would have required but
a moderate share of prudence, when we first began
this practice of mortgaging, to have foretold, from
the nature of men and of ministers, that things would
necessarily be carried to the length we see; so now
that they have at last happily reached it, it may not
be difficult to guess at the consequences. It must, in∣deed,
be one of these two events; either the nation
must destroy public credit, or public credit will de∣stroy
the nation. 'Tis impossible they can both sub∣sist,
after the manner they have been hitherto mana∣ged,
in this, as well as in some other nations.</P>
<P>THERE was, indeed, a scheme for the payment of
our debts, which was proposed by an excellent citi∣zen,
<PB N="146" REF="147"/>
Mr. HUTCHINSON, above thirty years ago, and
which was much approved of by some men of sense,
but never was likely to take effect. He asserted, that
there was a fallacy in imagining that the public owed
this debt; for that really every individual owed a
proportional share of it, and paid, in his taxes, a pro∣portional
share of the interest, beside the expences of
levying these taxes. Had we not better, then, says
he, make a proportional distribution of the debt a∣mong
us, and each of us contribute a sum suitable to
his property, and by that means discharge at once all
our funds and public mortgages? He seems not to
have considered, that the laborious poor pay a consi∣derable
part of the taxes by their annual consumptions,
tho' they could not advance, at once, a proportional
part of the sum required. Not to mention, that pro∣perty
in money and stock in trade might easily be
concealed or disguised; and that visible property in
lands and houses would really at last answer for the
whole: An inequality and oppression which never
would be submitted to. But tho' this project is never
likely to take place; 'tis not altogether improbable,
that when the nation become heartily sick of their
debts, and are cruelly oppressed by them, some da∣ring
projector may arise with visionary schemes for
their discharge. And as public credit will begin, by
that time, to be a little frail, the least touch will
<PB N="147" REF="148"/>
destroy it, as happened in FRANCE; and in this man∣ner
it will <HI>die of the doctor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some neighbouring states practise an easy expedient, by which they lighten their public debts. The FRENCH have a custom (as the ROMANS formerly had) of augmenting their money; and this the nation has been so much familiarized to, that it hurts not public credit, tho' it be really cutting off at once, by an edict, so much of their debts. The DUTCH di∣minish the interest, without the consent of their creditors; or, which is the same thing, they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property. Could we practise either of these methods, we need never be oppressed by the national debt; and 'tis not im∣possible but one of these, or some other method, may, at all ad∣ventures, be tried, on the augmentation of our incumbrances and difficulties. But people in this country are so good reason∣ers upon whatever regards their interest, that such a practice will deceive no body; and public credit will probably tumble at once by so dangerous a trial.</NOTE>:</P>
<P>BUT 'tis more probable, that the breach of nation∣al
faith will be the necessary effect of wars, defeats,
misfortunes, and public calamities, or even perhaps
of victories and conquests. I must confess, when I
see princes and states fighting and quarrelling, amidst
their debts, funds, and public mortgages, it always
brings to my mind a match of cudgel-playing fought
in a <HI>China</HI> shop. How can it be expected, that so∣vereigns
will spare a species of property, which is per∣nicious
to themselves and to the public, when they
have so little compassion on lives and properties,
which are useful to both? Let the time come (and
<PB N="148" REF="149"/>
surely it will come) when the new funds, created for
the exigencies of the year, are not subscribed to, and
raise not the money projected. Suppose, either that
the cash of the nation is exhausted; or that our faith,
which has been hitherto so ample, begins to fail us.
Suppose, that, in this distress, the nation is threaten∣ed
with an invasion,; a rebellion is suspected or broke
out at home; a squadron cannot be equipped for
want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a foreign
subsidy cannot be advanced. What must a prince or
minister do in such an emergence? The right of self-preservation
is analienable in every individual, much
more in every community. And the folly of our
slatesmen must then be greater than the folly of those
who first contracted debt, or, what is more, than that
of those who trusted, or continue to trust this security,
if these statesmen have the means of safety in their
hands, and do not employ them. The funds, cre∣ated
and mortgaged, will, by that time, bring in a
large yearly revenue, sufficient for the defence and se∣curity
of the nation: Money is perhaps lying in the
exchequer, ready for the discharge of the quarterly
interest: Necessity calls, fear urges, reason exhorts,
compassion alone exclaims: The money will immedi∣ately
be seized for the current service, under the most
solemn protestations, perhaps, of being immediately
replaced. But no more is requisite. The whole fa∣bric,
already tottering, falls to the ground, and bu∣ries
thousands in its ruins. And this, I think, may
<PB N="149" REF="150"/>
be called the <HI>natural death</HI> of public credit: For to
this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to
its dissolution and destruction<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">So great dupes are the generality of mankind, that, not∣withstanding such a violent shock to public credit, as a volun∣tary bankruptcy in ENGLAND would occasion, it would not probably be long, ere credit would again revive in as flourishing a condition as before. The present king of FRANCE, during the late war, borrowed money at lower interest than ever his grandfather did; and as low as the BRITISH parliament, com∣paring the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms. And tho' men are commonly more governed by what they have seen, than by what they foresee, with whatever certainty; yet promises, protestations, fair appearances, with the allurements of present interest, have such powerful interest as few are able to resist. Mankind are, in all ages, caught by the same baits: The same tricks, played over and over again, still trepan them. The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny; flattery to treachery; standing armies to arbitrary government; and the glory of God to the temporal in∣terest of the clergy. The fear of an everlasting destruction of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a needless bugbear, A pru∣dent man, in reality, would rather lend to the public immedi∣ately after they had taken a spunge to their debts, as at present; as much as an opulent knave, even tho' one could not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt: For the former, in order to carry on business, may find it his interest to discharge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The latter has it not in his power. The reasoning of TACITUS, <HI>Hist. lib.</HI> 3. as it is eter∣nally true, is very applicable to our present case. <HI>Sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum ade<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at: Stultissimus quisque pecuniis mer∣cabatur: Apud sapientes cassa habebantur, quae neque dari neque accipi, saiva republica, poterant.</HI> The public is a debtor, whom no man can oblige to pay. The only check which the creditors have on it, is the interest of preserving credit; an interest, which may easily be overbalanced by a very great debt, and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence, even supposing that cre∣dit irrecoverable. Not to mention, that a present necessity often forces states into measures which are, strictly speaking, against their interest.</NOTE>.</P>

These make a figure at present on their income; but, in case of a public bankruptcy, would, in an instant, become the lowest, as well as the most wretched of the people. The dignity and au∣thority of the landed gentry and nobility is much better rooted; and would render the contention very unequal, if ever we come to that extremity. One would incline to assign to this event a very near period, such as half a century, had not our fathers' prophecies of this kind been already found fallacious, by the du∣ration of our public credit, so much beyond all reasonable ex∣pectati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.

with the proprietors, as to render them more tena∣cious
of public faith, than prudence, policy, or even
justice, strictly speaking, requires. And perhaps, too,
our foreign enemies, or rather enemy (for we have
but one to dread) may be so politic as to discover,
that our safety lies in despair, and may not, therefore,
show the danger, open and barefaced, till it be ine∣vitable.
The balance of power in EUROPE, our
grandfathers, our fathers, and we, have all justly es∣teemed
too unequal to be preserved without our at∣tention
and assistance. But our children, weary with
the struggle, and fettered with incumbrances, may
sit down secure, and see their neighbours oppressed

<HEAD>ESSAY X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of SOME REMARKABLE CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>I SHALL observe three remarkable customs in three
celebrated governments; and shall conclude from
the whole, that all general maxims in politics ought
to be established with great reserve; and that irre∣gular
and extraordinary appearances are frequently
discovered in the moral, as well as in the physical
world. The former, perhaps, we can better account
for, after they happen, from springs and principles,
of which every one has, within himself, or from ob∣vious
observation, the strongest assurance and con∣viction:
But 'tis often fully as impossible for human
prudence, beforehand, to foresee and foretel them.</P>
<P>I. ONE would think it essential to every supreme
council or assembly, which debates, that intire liberty
of speech should be granted to every member, and
that all motions or reasonings should be received,
which can any way tend to illustrate the point under
deliberation. One would conclude, with still greater
<PB N="154" REF="155"/>
assurance, that, after a motion was made, which was
voted and approved by that assembly in which the le∣gislature
is lodged, the member who made the mo∣tion
must for ever be exempted from farther trial or
inquiry. But no political maxim can, at first fight,
appear more undisputable, than▪ that he must, at least,
be secured from all inferior jurisdiction; and that
nothing less than the same supreme legislative assem∣bly,
in their subsequent meetings, could render him
accountable for those motions and harangues which
they had before approved of. But these axioms,
however irrefragable they may appear, have all failed
in the ATHENIAN government, from causes and prin∣ciples
too, which appear almost inevitable.</P>
<P>By the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> or <HI>indictment of illegality,</HI>
(tho' it has not been remarked by antiquaries or
commentators) any man was tried and punished in a
common court of judicature, for any law which had
passed upon his motion, in the assembly of the peo∣ple,
if that law appeared to the court unjust, or preju∣dicial
to the public. Thus DEMOSTHENES, finding
that ship-money was levied irregularly, and that the
poor bore the same burden as the rich in equipping
the gallies, corrected this inequality by a very useful
law, which proportioned the expence to the revenue
and income of each individual. He moved for this
law in the assembly; he proved its advantages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His harangue for it is srill extant; # <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>; he
<PB N="155" REF="156"/>
convinced the people, the only legislature in ATHENS;
the law passed, and was carried into execution: And
yet he was tried in a criminal court for that law, upon
the complaint of the rich, who resented the alteration he
had introduced into the finances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pro CTESIPHONTE.</NOTE>. He was indeed
acquitted, upon proving anew the usefulness of this
law.</P>
<P>CTESIPHON moved in the assembly of the people,
that particular honours should be conferred on DE∣MOSTHENES,
as on a citizen affectionate and useful to
the commonwealth: The people, convinced of this
truth, voted those honours: Yet was CTESIPHON
tried by the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It was asserted, among
other topics, that DEMOSTHENES was not a good citi∣zen,
nor affectionate to the commonwealth: And the
orator was called upon to defend his friend, and con∣sequently
himself; which he executed by that sublime
piece of eloquence, that has ever since been the ad∣miration
of mankind.</P>
<P>AFTER the battle of CHAERONEA, a law was
passed, upon the motion of HYPERIDES, giving li∣berty
to slaves, and inrolling them in the troops<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCHUS <HI>in vita decem oratorum.</HI> DEMOSTHENES gives a different account of this law. <HI>Contra</HI> ARISTOGITON. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> II. He says, That its purport was, to render the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or to restore the privilege of bearing offices to those who had been declared incapable. Perhaps these were both clauses of the same law.</NOTE>.
<PB N="156" REF="157"/>
On account of this law, the orator was afterward
tried by the indictment above mentioned, and de∣fended
himself, among other topics, by that stroke
celebrated by PLUTARCH and LONGINUS. <HI>It was
not I,</HI> said he, <HI>that moved for this law: It was the
necessities of war; it was the battle of</HI> CHAERONEA.
The orations of DEMOSTHENES abound with many
instances of trials of this nature, and prove clearly,
that nothing was more commonly practised.</P>
<P>THE ATHENJAN Democracy was such a tumultuary
government, as we can scarce form a notion of in the
present age of the world. The whole collective bo∣dy
of the people voted in every law, without any li∣mitation
of property, without any distinction of
rank, without controul from any magistracy or se∣nate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The senate of the Bean was only a less numerous mob, cho∣sen by lot from among the people; and their authority was not great.</NOTE>; and consequently without regard to order,
justice, or prudence. The ATHENIANS soon became
fensible of the mischiefs attending this constitution:
But being averse to the checking themselves by any
rule or restriction, they resolved, at least, to check
<PB N="157" REF="158"/>
their demagogues or counsellors, by the fear of future
punishment and inquiry. They accordingly instituted
this remarkable law; a law esteemed so essential to
their government, that AESCHINES insists on it as a
known truth, that, were it abolished or neglected, it
were impossible for the Democracy to subsist<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> CTESIPHONTEM.

And he accounts for it, from the same principles that we here reason upon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE people feared not any ill consequences to li∣berty
from the authority of the criminal courts; be∣cause
these were nothing but very numerous juries,
chosen by lot from among the people. And they con∣sidered
themselves justly as in a state of pupillage;
where they had an authority, after they came to the
use of reason, not only to retract and controul what∣ever
had been determined, but to punish any guar∣dian
for measures which they had embraced by his
persuasion. The same law had place in THEBES<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">PLUT. <HI>in vita</HI> PELO<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>;
and for the same reason.</P>
<P>IT appears to have been an usual practice in
ATHENS, on the establishment of any law esteemed
<PB N="158" REF="159"/>
very useful or popular, to prohibit for ever its abro∣gation
and repeal. Thus the demagogue, who di∣verted
all the public revenues to the support of shows
and spectacles, made it criminal so much as to move
for a repeal of this law<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DEMOST. <HI>Olynth.</HI> 1. 2.</NOTE>. Thus LEPTINES
moved for a law, not only to recal all the immunities
formerly granted, but to deprive the people for the
future of the power of granting any more<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">DEMOST. <HI>contra</HI> LEPT.</NOTE>. Thus
all bills of attainder<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">DEMOST. <HI>contra</HI> ARISTOCRATEM.</NOTE> were forbid, or laws that affect
one ATHENIAN, without extending to the whole
commonwealth. These absurd clauses, by which the
legislature vainly attempted to bind itself for ever,
proceeded from an universal sense of the levity and
inconstancy of the people.</P>
<P>II. A WHEEL within a wheel, such as we observe
in the GERMAN empire, is considered by Lord
SHAFTESBURY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essay on the freedom of wit and humour, part 3. § 2.</NOTE> as an absurdity in politics: But what
must we say to two equal wheels, which govern the
same political machine, without any mutual check,
controul, or subordination; and yet preserve the
greatest harmony and concord? To establish two
distinct legislatures, each of which possesses full and
<PB N="159" REF="160"/>
absolute authority within itself, and stands in no need
of the other's assistance, in order to give validity to its
acts; this may appear, beforehand, altogether im∣practicable,
as long as men are actuated by the pas∣sions
of ambition, emulation, and avarice, which
have been hitherto their chief governing principles.
And should I assert, that the state I have in my eye was
divided into two distinct factions, each of which pre∣dominated
in a distinct legislature, and yet produced
no clashing in these independent powers; the suppo∣sition
may appear almost incredible. And if, to aug∣ment
the paradox, I should affirm, that this disjoint∣ed,
irregular government, was the most active, tri∣umphant,
and illustrious commonwealth, that ever
yet appeared on the stage of the world; I should cer∣tainly
be told, that such a political chimera was as ab∣surd
as any vision of the poets. But there is no need
for searching long, in order to prove the reality of the
foregoing suppositions: For this was actually the
case with the ROMAN republic.</P>
<P>THE legislative power was there lodged both in
the <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> and <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> In the for∣mer,
'tis well known, the people voted according to
their <HI>census;</HI> so that when the first class was unani∣mous,
tho' it contained not, perhaps, the hundredth
part of the commonwealth, it determined the whole;
and, with the authority of the senate, established a
law. In the latter, every vote was alike; and as
<PB N="160" REF="161"/>
the authority of the senate was not there requisite,
the lower people intirely prevailed, and gave law to
the whole state. In all party-divisions, at first be∣tween
the PATRICIANS and PLEBEIANS, afterwards
between the nobles and the people, the interest of the
Aristocracy was predominant in the first legislature;
that of the Democracy in the second: The one could
always destory what the other had established: Nay,
the one, by a sudden and unforeseen motion, might
take the start of the other, and totally annihilate its
rival, by a vote, which, from the nature of the con∣stitution,
had the full authority of a law. But no such
contest or struggle is observed in the history of ROME:
No instance of a quarrel between these two legis∣latures;
tho' many between the parties that governed
in each. Whence arose this concord, which may seem
so extraordinary?</P>
<P>THE legislature established at ROME, by the autho∣rity
of SERVIUS TULLIUS, was the <HI>comitia centuri∣ata,</HI>
which, after the expulsion of the king, render∣ed
the government, for some time, altogether aristo∣cratical.
But the people, having numbers and force
on their side, and being elated with frequent con∣quests
and victories in their foreign wars, always pre∣vailed
when pushed to extremities, and first extorted
from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes, and
then the legislative power of the <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> It
then behoved the nobles to be more careful than ever
<PB N="161" REF="162"/>
not to provoke the people. For beside the force
which the latter were always possessed of, they had
now got possession of legal authority, and could in∣stantly
break in pieces any order or institution which
directly opposed them. By intrigue, by influence,
by money, by combination, and by the respect paid
their character, the nobles might often prevail, and
direct the whole machine of government: But had
they openly set their <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> in opposition
to the <HI>tributa,</HI> they had soon lost the advantage of that
institution, together with their consuls, praetors, e∣diles,
and all the magistrates elected by it. But the
<HI>comitia tributa,</HI> not having the same reason for re∣specting
the <HI>centuriata,</HI> frequently repealed laws fa∣vourable
to the Aristocracy: They limited the autho∣rity
of the nobles, protected the people from oppres∣sion,
and controlled the actions of the senate and
magistracy. The <HI>centuriata</HI> found it convenient al∣ways
to submit; and tho' equal in authority, yet be∣ing
inferior in power, durst never directly give any
shock to the other legislature, either by repealing its
laws, or establishing laws, which, it foresaw, would
soon be repealed by it.</P>
<P>NO instance is found of any opposition or struggle
between these <HI>comitia;</HI> except one slight attempt of
this kind, mentioned by APPIAN in the third book
of his civil wars. MARK ANTHONY, resolving to
deprive DECIMUS BRUTUS of the government of
<PB N="162" REF="163"/>
CISALPINE GAUL, railed in the <HI>Forum,</HI> and called
one of the <HI>comitia,</HI> in order to prevent the meeting
of the other, which had been ordered by the senate.
But affairs were then fallen into such confusion, and
the ROMAN constitution was so near its final disso∣lution,
that no inference can be drawn from such an
expedient. This contest, besides, was founded more
on from than party. It was the senate who ordered
the <HI>comitia tributa,</HI> that they might obstruct the
meeting of the <HI>centuriata,</HI> which, by the constitution,
or at least forms of the government, could alone dis∣pose
of provinces.</P>
<P>CICERO was recalled by the <HI>comitia centuriata,</HI> tho'
banished by the <HI>tributa,</HI> that is, by a <HI>plebiscitum.</HI> But
his banishment, we may observe, never was considered
as a legal deed, arising from the free choice and incli∣nation
of the people. It was always ascribed to the
violence alone of CLODIUS, and the disorders intro∣duced
by him into the government.</P>
<P>III. THE <HI>third</HI> custom which we proposed to ob∣serve,
regards ENGLAND; and tho' it be not so im∣portant
as those which we have pointed out in
ATHENS and ROME, it is no less singular and re∣markable.
'Tis a maxim in politics, which we rea∣dily
admit as undisputed and universal, That a power,
however great, when granted by law to an eminent
magistrate, is not so dangerous to liberty, as an au∣thority,
<PB N="163" REF="164"/>
however inconsiderable, which he acquires
from violence and usurpation. For, besides that the
law always limits every power which it bestows, the
very receiving it as a concession establishes the autho∣rity
whence it is derived, and preserves the harmony
of the constitution. By the same right that one pre∣rogative
is assumed without law, another may also
be claimed, and another, with still greater facility;
while the first usurpations both serve as precedents to
the following, and give force to maintain them.
Hence the heroism of HAMPDEN, who sustained the
whole violence of royal prosecution, rather than pay
a tax of twenty shillings not imposed by parliament;
hence the care of all ENGLISH partriots to guard
against the first encroachments of the crown; and
hence alone the existence, at this day, of ENGLISH
liberty.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one occasion, where the par∣liament
has departed from this maxim; and that is,
in the <HI>pressing of seamen.</HI> The exercise of an illegal
power is here tacitly permitted in the crown; and
tho' it has frequently been under deliberation, how
that power might be rendered legal, and granted, un∣der
proper restrictions to the sovereign, no safe expe∣dient
could ever be proposed for that purpose, and the
danger to liberty always appeared greater from law
than from usurpation. While this power is exercised
to no other end than to man the navy, men willingly
<PB N="164" REF="165"/>
submit to it, from a sense of its use and necessity; and
the sailors, who are alone affected by it, find no body
to support them, in claiming the rights and privileges
which the law grants, without distinction, to all ENG∣LISH
subjects. But were this power, on any occa∣sion,
made an instrument of faction or ministerial ty∣ranny,
the opposite faction, and indeed all lovers of
their country, would immediately take the alarm, and
support the injured party; the liberty of ENGLISH∣MEN
would be asserted; juries would be implacable;
and the tools of tyranny, acting both against law and
equity, would meet with the severest vengeance. On
the other hand, were the parliament to grant such an
authority, they would probably fall into one of these
two inconveniencies: They would either bestow it
under so many restrictions as would make it lose its
effects, by cramping the authority of the crown; or
they would render it so large and comprehensive, as
might give occasion to great abuses, for which we
could, in that case, have no remedy. The very ille∣gality
of the power, at present, prevents its abuses, by
affording so easy a remedy against them.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not, by this reasoning, to exclude all
possibility of contriving a register for seamen, which
might man the navy, without being dangerous to li∣berty.
I only observe, that no satisfactory scheme of
that nature has yet been proposed. Rather than ad∣opt
any project hitherto invented, we continue a
<PB N="165" REF="166"/>
practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable.
Authority, in times of full internal peace and con∣cord,
is armed against law. A continued and open
usurpation in the crown is permitted, amidst the
greatest jealousy and watchfulness in the people; nay
proceeding from those very principles: Liberty, in a
country of the highest liberty, is left intirely to its own
defence, without any countenance or protection: The
wild state of nature is renewed, in one of the most ci∣vilized
societies of mankind: And great violences and
disorders among the people, the most humane and the
best natured, are committed with impunity; while the
one party pleads obedience to the supreme magistrate,
the other the sanction of fundamental laws.</P>

So learned a refutation would have made the author suspect, that his reason∣ings were entirely overthrown, had he not used the precaution, from the beginning, to keep himself on the sceptical side; and having taken this advantage of the ground, he was enabled, tho' with much inferior forces, to preserve himself from a total defeat.

<P>THERE is very little ground, either from reason
or experience, to conclude the universe enternal
or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of
<PB N="168" REF="168"/>
matter, the violent revolutions with which every part
is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the
plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge,
or general convulsion of the elements; all these prove
strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and
its passage, by corruption or dissolution, from one state
or order to another. It must, therefore, have its in∣fancy,
youth, manhood, and old age, as well as each
individual from which it contains; and 'tis probable,
that, in all these variations, man, equally with every
animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flourish∣ing
age of the world, it may be expected, that the
human species should possess greater vigour both of
mind and body, more prosperous health, higher spi∣rits,
longer life, and a stronger inclination and power
of generation. But if the general system of things,
and human society of course, have any such gradual
revolutions, they are too slow to be discernible in that
short period which is comprehended by history and
tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life,
even courage and extent of genius, seem hitherto to
have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the
same. The arts and sciences, indeed, have flourished
in one period, and have decayed in another: But we
may observe, that at the time when they rose to
greatest perfection among one people, they were per∣haps
totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations;
<PB N="169" REF="169"/>
and tho' they universally decayed in one age, yet in a
succeeding generation they again revived, and diffused
themselves over the world. As far, therefore, as ob∣servation
reaches, there is no universal difference dis∣cernible
in the human species: And tho' it were al∣lowed,
that the universe, like an animal body, had
a natural progress from infancy to old age; yet as it
must still be uncertain whether, at present, it be ad∣vancing
to its point of perfection, or declining from
it, we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human
nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">COLUMELLA says, lib. 3. cap. 8. that in AEGYPT and AFRICA the bearing of twins was frequent, and even custom∣ary; <HI>gemini partus familiares, ac paene solennes sunt.</HI> If this was true, there is a physical difference both in countries and ages. For travellers make no such remarks of these countries at present. On the countrary, we are apt to suppose the northern nations more fertile. As those two countries were provinces of the Roman empire, 'tis difficult, tho' not altogether absurd, to suppose that such a man as COLUMELLA might be mistaken with regard to them.</NOTE>. To prove, therefore, or account for the
greater populousness of antiquity, by the imaginary
youth or vigour of the world, will scarce be admitted
by any just reasoner. These <HI>general physical</HI> causes
ought entirely to be excluded from that question.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed some more <HI>particular physi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al</HI>
causes of great importance. Diseases are mentioned
<PB N="170" REF="170"/>
in antiquity, which are almost unknown to modern
medicine; and new diseases have arisen, and propa∣gated
themselves, of which there are no traces in an∣tient
history. And in this particular we may ob∣serve,
upon comparison, that the disadvantage is very
much on the side of the moderns. Not to mention
some others of less importance; the small pox com∣mits
such ravages, as would almost alone account for
the great superiority ascribed to antient times. The
tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, destroyed every
generation, should make a vast difference, it may be
thought, in the numbers of the people; and when
joined to veneral distempers, a new plague diffused
every where, this disease is perhaps equivalent, by its
constant operation, to the three great scourges of man∣kind,
war, pestilence, and famine. Were it certain,
therefore, that antient times were more populous than
the present, and could no moral causes be assigned
for so great a change; these physical causes alone, in
the opinion of many, would be sufficient to give us
satisfaction on that head.</P>
<P>BUT is it certain, that antiquity was so much more
populous, as is pretended? The extravagancies of
VOSSIUS, with regard to his subject, are well known.
But an author of much greater genius and discern∣ment
has ventured to affirm, that, according to the
best computations which these subjects will admit of,
there are not now, on the face of the earth, the fif∣tieth
<PB N="171" REF="171"/>
part of mankind, which existed in the time of
JULIUS CAESAR<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lettres</HI> PERSANES. See also <HI>L'Esprit des Loix,</HI> liv. 23. cap. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE>. It may easily be observed, that
the comparisons, in this case, must be very imperfect,
even tho' we confine ourselves to the scene of antient
history; EUROPE, and the nations about the MEDI∣TERRANEAN.
We know not exactly the numbers of
any EUROPEAN kingdom, or even city, at present:
How can we pretend to calculate those of antient
cities and states, where historians have left us such
imperfect traces? For may pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, the matter appears
to me so uncertain, that, as I intend to throw toge∣ther
some reflections on that head, I shall intermingle
the inquiry concerning <HI>causes</HI> with that concerning
<HI>facts;</HI> which ought never to be admitted, where the
facts can be ascertained with any tolerable assurance.
We shall, <HI>first,</HI> consider, whether it be probable, from
what we know of the situation of society in both pe∣riods,
that antiquity must have been more populous;
<HI>secondly,</HI> whether in reality it was so. If I can make it
appear, that the conclusion is not so certain as is pre∣tended,
in favour of antiquity, 'tis all I aspire to.</P>
<P>IN general, we may observe, that the question with
regard to the comparative populousness of ages or
kingdoms implies very important consequences, and
commonly determines concerning the preference of their
<PB N="172" REF="172"/>
whole police, their manners, and the constitution of their
government. For as there is in all men, both male and
female, a desire and power of generation, more ac∣tive
than is very universally exerted, the restraints which
they lie under, must proceed from some difficulties
in their situation, which it belongs to a wise legisla∣ture
carefully to observe and remove. Almost every
man who thinks he can maintain a family, will have
one; and the human species, at this rate of propaga∣tion,
would more than double every generation.
How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or
new settlement; where it is an easy matter to provide
for a family; and where men are no way straitened or
confined, as in long established governments? History
tells us frequently of plagues, which have swept away
the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a ge∣neration
or two, the destruction was not perceived;
and the society had again acquired their former num∣ber.
The lands which were cultivated, the houses
built, the commodities raised, the riches acquired,
enabled the people who escaped, immediately to mar∣ry,
and to rear families, which supplied the place of
those who had perished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This too is a good reason why the small-pox does not depo∣pulate countries so much as may at first sight be imagined. Where there is room for more people, they will always arise, even with∣out the assistance of naturalization bills. 'Tis remarked by Don GERONIMO DE USTARIZ, that the provinces of SPAIN which send most people to the INDIES, are most populous; which pro∣ceeds from their superior riches.</NOTE>. And for a like reason,
<PB N="173" REF="173"/>
every wise, just, and mild government, by rendering
the condition of its subjects easy and secure, will al∣ways
abound most in people, as well as in commodi∣ties
and riches. A count<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, indeed, whose climate
and soil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more
populous than one which produces only corn, and
that more populous than one which is only fitted for
pasturage. But if every thing else be equal, it seems
natural to expect, that where-ever there are most hap∣piness
and virtue, and the wisest institutions, there will
also be most people.</P>
<P>THE question, therefore, concerning the populous∣ness
of antient and modern times, being allowed of
great importance, it will be requisite, if we would
bring it to some determination, to compare both the
<HI>domestic</HI> and <HI>political</HI> situation of these two periods, in
order to judge of the facts by their moral causes;
which is the <HI>first</HI> view in which we proposed to con∣sider
them.</P>
<P>THE chief difference between the <HI>domestic</HI> oecono∣my
of the ancients and that of the moderns consists
in the practice of slavery, which prevailed among the
former, and which has been abolished for some cen∣turies
<PB N="174" REF="174"/>
thro' out the greatest part of EUROPE. Some
passionate admirers of the antients, and zealous par∣tizans
of civil liberty, (for these sentiments, as they
are both of them, in the main, extremely just, are
sound to be almost inseparable) cannot forbear re∣gretting
the loss of this institution; and whilst they
brand all submission to the government of a single
person with the harsh denomination of slavery, they
would gladly reduce the greatest part of mankind to
real slavery and subjection. But to one who considers
coolly on the subject, it will appear, that human na∣ture,
in general, really enjoys more liberty at pre∣sent,
in the most arbitrary government of EUROPE,
than it ever did during the most flourishing period of
antient times. As much as submission to a petty
prince, whose dominions extend not beyond a single
city, is more grievous than obedience to a great mo∣narch;
so much is domestic slavery more cruel and
oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever. The
more the master is removed from us in place and rank,
the greater liberty we enjoy; the less are our actions
inspected and controled; and the fainter that cruel
comparison becomes between our own subjection, and
the freedom, and even dominion of another. The
remains that are found of domestic slavery, in the
AMERICAN colonies, and among some EUROPEAN
nations, would never surely create a desire of render∣ing
it more universal. The little humanity commonly
<PB N="175" REF="175"/>
observed in persons accustomed, from their infancy,
to exercise so great authority over their fellow-crea∣tures,
and to trample upon human nature, were suf∣ficient
alone to disgust us with that authority. Nor
can a more probable reason be given for the severe, I
might say, barbarous, manners of antient times, than
the practice of domestic slavery; by which every man
of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated
amidst the flattery, submission, and low debasement
of his slaves.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the antient practice, all checks were
on the inferior, to restrain him to the duty of sub∣mission;
none on the superior, to engage him to the
reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity. In
modern times, a bad servant finds not easily a good
master, nor a bad master a good servant; and the
checks are mutual, suitable to the inviolable and
eternal laws of reason and equity.</P>
<P>THE custom of exposing old, useless, or sick slaves
in an island of the TYBER, there to starve, seems to
have been pretty common in ROME; and whoever re∣covered,
after having been so exposed, had his liberty
given him, by an edict of the emperor CLAUDIUS;
where it was likewise forbid to kill any slave merely
for old age or sickness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">SUETONIUS in vita CLAUDII.</NOTE>. But supposing that this
<PB N="176" REF="176"/>
edict was strictly obeyed, would it better the domes∣tic
treatment of slaves, or render their lives much
more comfortable? We may imagine what others
would practise, when it was the professed maxim of
the elder CATO, to sell his superannuated slaves for
any price, rather than maintain what he esteemed an
useless burthen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUT. in vita CATONIS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>ergastula,</HI> or dungeons, where slaves in chains
were forced to work, were very common all over
ITALY. COLUMELLA<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 6.</NOTE> advises, that they be always
built under ground; and recommends<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 11. cap. 1.</NOTE> it as the duty
of a careful overseer, to call over every day the names of
these slaves, like the mustering of a regiment or ship's
company, in order to know presently when any of
them had deserted. A proof of the frequency of these
<HI>ergastula,</HI> and of the great number of slaves usually
confined in them.</P>
<P>A CHAINED slave for a porter was usual in ROME,
as appears from OVID<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Amor. lib. 1. eleg. 6.</NOTE>, and other authors<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>SUETON.</HI> de claris rhetor. <HI>So also the antient poet.</HI> Ja∣nit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ris tintinnire impedim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nta audio.</NOTE>. Had
not these people shaken off all sense of compassion

they have presented all their friends, at the first en∣trance,
with such an image of the severity of the mas∣ter,
and misery of the slave?</P>
<P>NOTHING so common in all trials, even of civil
causes, as to call for the evidence of slaves; which
was always extorted by the most exquisite torments.
DEMOSTHENES says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> Oniterem orat. 1.</NOTE>, that where it was possible to
produce, for the same fact, either freemen or slaves
as witnesses, the judges always preferred the torturing
of slaves, as a more certain and infallible evidence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The same practice was common in ROME; but CIC<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RO seems not to think this evidence so certain as the testimony of free-citizens. <HI>Pro Coelio.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>SENECA draws a picture of that disorderly luxury,
which changes day into night, and night into day,
and inverts every stated hour of every office in life.
Among other circumstances, such as displacing the
meals and times of bathing, he mentions, that regu∣larly,
about the third hour of the night, the neigh∣bours
of one who indulges this false refinement, hear
the noise of whips and lashes; and, upon inquiry, find
that he is then taking an account of the conduct of his
servants, and giving them due correction and disci∣pline.
This is not remarked as an instance of cruelty,
but only of disorder, which, even in actions the most
<PB N="178" REF="178"/>
usual and methodical, changes the fixed hours that an
established custom had assigned them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Epist.</HI> 122. The inhuman sports exhibited at ROME, may justly be considered too as an effect of the people's contempt for slaves, and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can read the accounts of the am∣phitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is sur∣prized, that the emperors should treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors? One's humanity, on that occasion, is apt to renew the barbarous wish of CALIGULA, that the people had but one neck. A man could almost be pleased, by a single blow, to put an end to such a race of monsters. You may thank God, says the author above cited, <HI>(epist. 7.)</HI> address∣ing himself to the ROMAN people, that you have a master, <HI>(viz.</HI> the mild and merciful NERO), who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example. This was spoke in the beginning of his reign: But he fitted them very well afterwards; and no doubt was considerably improved by the sight of the barbarous objects, to which he had, from his infancy, been accustomed.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT our present business is only to consider the
influence of slavery on the populousness of a state.
'Tis pretended, that, in this particular, the antient
practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the
chief cause of that extreme populousness which is
supposed in those times. At present, all masters dis∣courage
the marrying of their male servants, and ad∣mit
not by any means the marriage of the female,
who are then supposed altogether incapacitated for
<PB N="179" REF="179"/>
their service. But where the property of the servants
is lodged in the master, their marriage and fertility
form his riches, and bring him a succession of slaves,
that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity
have disabled. He encourages, therefore, their pro∣pagation
as much as that of his cattle; rears the
young with the same care; and educates them to
some art or calling, which may render them more
useful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this
policy, interested in the being at least, tho' not the
well-being of the poor; and enrich themselves, by
increasing the number and industry of those who are
subjected to them. Each man, being a sovereign in
his own family, has the same interest with regard to
it, as the prince with regard to the state; and has
not, like the prince, any opposite motives of ambi∣tion
or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopu∣late
his little sovereignty. All of it is, at all times,
under his eye; and he has leisure to inspect the most
minute detail of the marriage and education of his
subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may here observe, that if domestic slavery really in∣creased populousness, it would be an exception to the general rule, that the happiness of any society and its populousness are necessary attendants. A master, from humour or interest, may make his slaves very unhappy, and yet be careful, from interest, to increase their number. Their marriage is not a matter of choice with them, no more than any other action of their life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="180"/>
SUCH are the consequences of domestic slavery,
according to the first aspect and appearance of things:
But if we enter more deeply into the subject, we shall
perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations.
The comparison is shocking between the management
of human creatures and that of cattle; but being ex∣tremely
just, when applied to the present subject, it
may be proper trace the consequences of it. At
the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich,
industrious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provi∣sions,
lodging, attendance, labour, are there dear;
and men find better their account in buying the cattle,
after they come to a certain age, from the remoter
and cheaper countries. These are consequently the
only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of
reason, for men too, when the latter are put on the
same footing with the former. To rear a child in
LONDON till he could be serviceable, would cost
much dearer, than to buy one of the same age from
SCOTLAND or IRELAND; where he had been raised
in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal
or potatoes. Those who had slaves, therefore, in all
the richer and more populous countries, would dis∣courage
the pregnancy of the females, and either
prevent or destroy the birth. The human species
would perish in those places where it ought to increase
the fastest; and a perpetual recruit be needed from all
the poorer and more desart provinces. Such a conti∣nued
drain would tend mightily to depopulate the
<PB N="181" REF="181"/>
state, and render great cities ten times more destruc∣tive
than with us; where every man is master of him∣self,
and provides for his children from the powerful
instinct of nature, not the calculations of sordid in∣terest.
If LONDON, at present, without much in∣creasing,
needs a yearly recruit from the country of
5000 people, as is commonly computed; what must
it require, if the greatest part of the tradesmen and
common people were slaves, and were hindered from
breeding by their avaricious masters?</P>
<P>ALL antient authors tell us, that there was a per∣petual
flux of slaves to ITALY from the remoter pro∣vinces,
particularly SYRIA, CILICIA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ten thousand slaves in a day have been often sold for the use of the ROMANS, at DELUS in CILICIA. STRABO, lib. 14.</NOTE>, CAPPADO∣CIA,
the Lesser ASIA, THRACE, and EGYPT: Yet
the number of people increased not in ITALY; and
writers complain of the continual decay of industry
and agriculture<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">COLUMELLA, lib. 1. <HI>prooem.</HI> et cap. 2. et 7. VARRO, lib. 3. cap. 1. HORAT. lib. 2. od. 15. TACIT. <HI>annal.</HI> lib. 3. cap. 54. SUETON. <HI>in vita</HI> AUG. cap. 72. PLIN. lib. 18. cap. 13.</NOTE>. Where then is that extreme fer∣tility
of the ROMAN slaves, which is commonly sup∣posed?
So far from multiplying, they could not, it
seems, so much as keep up the stock, without im∣mense
<PB N="182" REF="182"/>
recruits. And tho' great numbers were conti∣nually
manumitted, and converted into ROMAN citi∣zens,
the numbers even of these did not increase<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Minore indies plebe ingenua, <HI>says TACITUS,</HI> ann. <HI>lib.</HI> 24. cap. 7.</NOTE>,
till the freedom of the city was communicated to fo∣reign
provinces.</P>
<P>THE term for a slave born and bred in the family,
was <HI>verna</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As <HI>servus</HI> was the name of the genus, and <HI>verna</HI> of the spe∣cies, without any correlative, this forms a strong presumption, that the latter were by far the least numerous. 'Tis an uni∣versal observation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank, or consideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which answer to both the parts, and express their mutual relation. If they bear no proportion to each other, the term is only invented for the less, and marks its distinction from the whole. Thus <HI>man</HI> and <HI>woman, master</HI> and <HI>servant, fa∣ther</HI> and <HI>son, prince</HI> and <HI>subject, stranger</HI> and <HI>citizen;</HI> are correla∣tive terms. But the words, <HI>seaman, carpenter, smith, tailor,</HI> &amp;c. have no correspondent terms, which express those who are no seamen, no carpenter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains; and may thence afford very strong inferences, concerning the manners and customs of different nations. The military government of the ROMAN emperors had exalted the soldiery so high, that they balanced all the other orders of the state: Hence <HI>miles</HI> and <HI>paga∣nus</HI> became relative terms; a thing, till then, unknown to an∣tient, and still so to modern languages. Modern superstition ex∣alted the clergy so high, that they overbalanced the whole state: Hence <HI>clergy</HI> and <HI>laity</HI> are terms opposed in all modern languages; and in these alone. And from the same principles I infer, that if the number of slaves bought by the ROMANS from foreign countries, had not extremely exceeded those bred at home, <HI>verna</HI> would have had a correlative, which would have expressed the former species of slaves. But these, it would seem, composed the main body of the antient slaves, and the latter were but a few exceptions.</NOTE>; and these slaves seem to have been in∣titled
<PB N="183" REF="183"/>

that practice was not then very common?</P>
<P>THE names of slaves in the GREEK comedies,
SYRUS, MYSUS, GETA, THRAX, DAVUS, LYDUS,
PHRYX, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afford a presumption, that at ATHENS,
at least, most of the slaves were imported from fo∣reign
nations. The ATHENIANS, says STRABO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>,
gave to their slaves, either the names of the nations
whence they were bought, as LYDUS, SYRUS; or the
names that were most common among those nations,
as MANES or MIDAS to a PHRYGIAN, TIBIAS to a
PAPHLAGONIAN.</P>
<P>DEMOSTHENES, after having mentioned a law
which forbid any man to strike the slave of another,
praises the humanity of this law; and adds, that if
the barbarians from whom slaves were bought had in∣formation
that their countrymen met with such gentle
treatment, they would entertain a great esteem for the
ATHENIANS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In MIDIAM, p. 221. ex edit. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>DI.</NOTE>. ISOCRATES<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Panegyr.</NOTE> too infinuates, that the

<PB N="185" REF="185"/>
barbarians. ARISTOTLE in his Politics<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7. cap. 10. sub. fin.</NOTE>
plainly supposes, that a slave is always a foreigner.
The antient comic writers represented the slaves, as
speaking a barbarous language<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">ARISTOPH. Equites, l. 17. The antient scholiast remarks on this passage <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</NOTE>. This was an imi∣tation
of nature.</P>
<P>'TIS well known that DEMOSTHENES, in his non-age,
had been defrauded of a large fortune by his
tutors, and that afterwards he recovered, by a prose∣cution
at law, the value of his patrimony. His ora∣tions,
on that occasion, still remain, and contain a very
exact detail of the whole substance left by his father<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> Aphobum orat. 1.</NOTE>,
in money, merchandise, houses, and slaves, together
with the value of each particular. Among the rest
were 52 slaves, handicraftsmen, <HI>viz.</HI> 32 sword-cutlers,
and 20 cabinet-makers<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, makers of those beds which the antients lay upon at meals.</NOTE>; all males; not a word of any
wives, children, or family, which they certainly would
have had, had it been a common custom at ATHENS
to breed from the slaves: And the value of the whole
must have depended very much on that circumstance.
No female slaves are even so much as mentioned,
excpet some house-maids, who belonged to his mo∣ther.
<PB N="186" REF="186"/>
This argument has great force, if it be not al∣together
decisive.</P>
<P>CONSIDER this passage of PLUTARCH<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In vita CATONIS.</NOTE>, speaking
of the elder CATO. “He had a great number of
slaves, whom he took care to buy at the sales of
prisoners of war; and he chose them young, that
they might easily be accustomed to any diet or man∣ner
of life, and be instructed in any business or la∣bour,
as men teach any thing to young dogs or
horses.—And esteeming love the chief source of
all disorders, he allowed the male slaves to have a
commerce with the female in his family, upon pay∣ing
a certain sum for this privilege: But he strictly
forbad all intrigues out of his family.” Are there
any symptoms in this narration of that care which is
supposed in the antients, of the marriage and propa∣gation
of their slaves? If that was a common prac∣tice,
founded on general interest, it would surely have
been embraced by CATO, who was a great oeconomist,
and lived in times when the antient frugality and sim∣plicity
of manners were still in credit and reputation.</P>
<P>IT is expressly remarked by the writers of the RO∣MAN
law, that scarce any ever purchase slaves with a
view of breeding from them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Non temere ancillae ejus rei causa comparantur ut pari∣ant.” <HI>Digest.</HI> lib. 5. tit. 3. <HI>de ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red, petit. lex</HI> 27.

His impotence, it seems, was only regarded so far as his health or life might be affected by it. In other respects, he was full as valuable. The same reasoning is employed with regard to female slaves. “Quae∣ritur de ea muliere quae semper mortuos parit, an morbosa sit? et ait Sabinus, si vulvae vitio hoc contingit, morbosam esse.” <HI>Id. lex</HI> 14. It has even been doubted, whether a wo∣man pregnant was morbid or vitiated; and it is determined, that she is sound, not on account of the value of her offspring, but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children. “Si mulier praegnans venerit, inter omens convenit sanam eam esse. Maximum enim ac praecipuum munus foeminarum ac∣cipere ac tueri conceptum. Puerperam quoque sanam esse; si modo nihil extrinsecus accedit, quod corpus ejus in aliquam valetudinem immitteret.

<P>So early as the poet HESIOD<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Opera et Dies, lib. 2. l. 24. also l. 220.</NOTE>, married slaves, whe∣ther
male or female, were esteemed very inconvenient.
How much more, where families had increased to such
an enormous size, as in ROME, and the antient sim∣plicity
of manners was banished from all ranks of
people?</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="189"/>
XENOPHON in his Oeconomics, where he gives di∣rections
for the management of a farm, recommends
a strict care and attention of laying the male and the
female slaves at a distance from each other. He seems
not to suppose that they are ever married. The only
slaves among the GREEKS that appear to have conti∣nued
their own breed, were the HELOTES, who had
houses apart, and were more the slaves of the public
than of individuals.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">STRABO, lib. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same author<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De ratione redituum.</NOTE> tells us, that NICIAS's over∣seer,
by agreement with his master, was obliged to
pay him an obolus a day for each slave; besides main∣taining
them, and keeping up the number. Had the
antient slaves been all breeders, this last circumstance
of the contract had been superfluous.</P>
<P>THE antients talk so frequently of a fixed, stated
portion of provisions assigned to each slave<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See CATO de re rustica, cap. 56. Donatus in Phormion. l. 1. 9. SENICAE epist. 80.</NOTE>, that we
are naturally led to conclude, that slaves lived almost
all single, and received that portion as a kind of board-wages.</P>
<P>THE practice, indeed, of marrying the slaves seems
not to have been very common, even among the
<PB N="190" REF="190"/>
country-labourers, where it is more naturally to be
expected. CATO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De re rust. cap. 10, 11.</NOTE>, enumerating the slaves requisite
to labour a vineyard of a hundred acres, makes them
amount to 15; the overseer and his wife, <HI>villicus</HI> and
<HI>villica,</HI> and 13 male slaves; for an olive plantation of
240 acres, the overseer and his wife, and 11 male
slaves; and so in proportion to a greater or less plan∣tation
or vineyard.</P>
<P>VARRO<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 18.</NOTE>, citing this passage of CATO, allows his
computation to be just in every respect, except the
last. For as it is requisite, says he, to have an over∣seer
and his wife, whether the vineyard or plantation
be great or small, this must alter the exactness of the
proportion. Had CATO's computation been errone∣ous
in any other respect, it had certainly been cor∣rected
by VARRO, who seems found of discovering so
trivial an error.</P>
<P>THE same author<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 17.</NOTE>, as well as COLUMELLA<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 18.</NOTE>, re∣commends
it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer,
in order to attach him the more strongly to his mas∣ter's
service. This was therefore a peculiar indul∣gence
<PB N="191" REF="191"/>
granted to a slave, in whom so great a confi∣dence
was reposed.</P>
<P>IN the same place, VARRO mentions it as an use∣ful
precaution, not to buy too many slaves from the
same nation, lest they beget factions and feditions in
the family▪ A presumption that in ITALY the greatest
part, even of the country labouring slaves, (for he
speaks of no other) were bought from the remoter
provinces. All the world knows, that the family-slaves
in ROME, who were instruments of show and
luxury, were commonly imported from the east. <HI>Hoc

<P>IT is indeed recommended by VARRO<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 10.</NOTE>, to propa∣gate
young shepherds in the family from the old ones.
For as grasing farms were commonly in remote and
cheap places, and each shepherd lived in a cottage
apart, his marriage and increase were not liable to
the same inconveniencies as in dearer places,and
where many servants lived in a family; which was
universally the case in such of the ROMAN farms as
produced wine or corn. If we consider this exception
<PB N="192" REF="192"/>
with regard to the shepherds, and weight the reason
of it, it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our
foregoing suspicions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pastoris duri est hic filius, ille bubulci. JUVEN. sat. 11. 151.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COLUMELLA<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 8.</NOTE>, I own, advises the master to give
a reward, and even liberty to a female slave, that
had reared him above three children: A proof, that
sometimes the antients propagated from their slaves;
which, indeed, cannot be denied. Were it other∣wise,
the practice of slavery, being so common in an∣tiquity,
must have been destructive to a degree which
no expedient could repair. All I pretend to infer
from these reasonings, is, that slavery is in general
disadvantageous both to the happiness and populous∣ness
of mankind, and that its place is much better
supplied by the practice of hired servants.</P>
<P>THE laws, or, as some writers call them, the se∣ditions

in SPAIN by the same expedient<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 4. cap. 8.</NOTE>. If the country-labourers,
throughout the ROMAN empire, were so
generally in this situation, and if it was difficult or
impossible to find separate lodgings for the families of
the city-servants, how unfavourable to propagation,
<PB N="194" REF="194"/>
as well as humanity, must the institution of domestic
slavery be esteemed?</P>
<P>CONSTANTINOPLE, at present, requires the same
recruits of slaves from all the provinces, which ROME
did of old; and these provinces are of consequence
far from being populous.</P>
<P>EGYPT, according to Mons. MAILLET, sends con∣tinual
colonies of black slaves to the other parts of
the TURKISH empire; and receives annually an equal
return of white: The one brought from the inland
parts of AFRICA; the other from MINGRELLA, CIR∣CASSIA,
and TARTARY.</P>
<P>OUR modern convents are, no doubt, very bad
institutions: But there is reason to suspect, that anti∣ently
every great family in ITALY, and probably in
other parts of the world, was a species of convent.
And tho' we have reason to detest all those popish in∣stitutions,
as nurseries of the most abject superstition,
burthensome to the public, and oppressive to the poor
prisoners, male as well as female; yet may it be
questioned whether they be so destructive to the po∣pulousness
of a state as is commonly imagined. Were
the land which belongs to a convent, bestowed on a
nobleman, he would spend its revenue on dogs, horses,
grooms, footmen, cooks, and house-maids; and his
<PB N="195" REF="195"/>
family would not furnish many more citizens than the
convent.</P>
<P>THE common reason why parents thrust their daugh∣ters
into nunneries, is, that they may not be over∣burthened
with too numerous a family; but the an∣tients
had a method almost as innocent, and more ef∣fectual
to that purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> the exposing their chil∣dren
in the earliest infancy. This practice was very
common; and is not mentioned by any author of
those times with the horror it deserves, or scarce<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TACITUS blames it. De morib. Germ.</NOTE> even
with disapprobation. PLUTARCH, the humane,
good natured PLUTARCH,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De fraterno amore. SENECA also approves of the exposing of sickly, infirm children. De ira, lib. 1. cap. 15.</NOTE> recommends it as a vir∣tue
in ATTALUS, king of PERGAMUS, that he mur∣dered,
or, if you will, exposed all his own children,
in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother,
EUMENES; signalizing in this manner his gratitude
and affection to EUMENES, who had left him his heir
preferable to that son. It was SOLON, the most cele∣brated
of the sages of GREECE, who gave parents
permission by law to kill their children<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">SEXT. EMP. lib. 3. cap. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL we then allow these two circumstances to
compensate each other, <HI>viz.</HI> monastic vows and the
exposing of children, and to be unfavourable, in
<PB N="196" REF="196"/>
equal degrees, to the propagation of mankind? I
doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity.
Perhaps, by an odd connection of causes, the barba∣rous
practice of the antients might rather render those
times more populous. By removing the terrors of
too numerous a family, it would engage many people
in marriage; and such is the force of natural affec∣tion,
that very few, in comparison, would have reso∣lution
enough, when it came to the push, to carry in∣to
execution their former intentions.</P>
<P>CHINA, the only country where this cruel prac∣tice
of exposing children prevails at present, is the
most populous country we know; and every man is
married before he is twenty. Such early marriages
could scarce be general, had not men the prospect of
so easy a method of getting rid of their children.
I own, that PLUTARCH<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De amore prolis.</NOTE> speaks of it as a very uni∣versal
maxim of the poor to expose their children;
and as the rich were then averse to marriage, on ac∣count
of the courtship they met with from those who
expected legacies from them, the public must have
been in a bad situation betwixt them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The practice of leaving great sums of money to friends, tho' one had near relations, was common in GREECE as well as ROME; as we may gather from LUCIAN.

<P>It may justly be thought, that the liberty of divorces in ROME was another discouragement to marriage. Such a practice pre∣vents not quarrels from <HI>humour,</HI> but rather increases them; and occasions also those from <HI>interest,</HI> which are much more dangerous and destructive.

OF all sciences there is none, where first appear∣ances
are more deceitful than in politics. Hospitals
for foundlings seem favourable to the increase of
numbers; and, perhaps, may be so, when kept un∣der
proper restrictions. But when they open the door
to every one, without distinction, they have probably
a contrary effect, and are pernicious to the state. 'Tis
computed, that every ninth child bron at PARIS, is
sent to the hospital; tho' it seems certain, according
to the common course of human affairs, that 'tis not
a hundredth part whose parents are altogether inca∣pacitated
to rear and educate them. The infinite dif∣ference,
for health, industry, and morals, between an
education in an hospital and that in a private family,
should induce us not to make the entrance into an
hospital too easy and engaging. To kill one's own
<PB N="198" REF="198"/>
child is shocking to nature, and must therefore be
pretty unusual; but to turn over the care of him up∣on
others is very tempting to the natural indolence of
mankind.</P>
<P>HAVING considered the domestic life and manners
of the antients, compared to those of the moderns;
where, in the main, we seem rather superior, so far
as the present question is concerned; we shall now
examine the <HI>political</HI> customs and institutions of both
ages, and weigh their influence in retarding or for∣warding
the propagation of mankind.</P>
<P>BEFORE the increase of the ROMAN power, or ra∣ther
till its full establishment, almost all the nations
which are the scene of antient history, were divided
into small territories or petty commonwealths, where
of course a great equality of fortune prevailed, and
the center of the government was always very near
its frontiers.</P>
<P>THIS was the situation of affairs not only in GREECE
and ITALY, but also in SPAIN, GAUL, GERMANY,
AFRIC, and a great part of the Lesser ASIA. And
it must be owned, that no institution could be more
favourable to the propagation of mankind. For tho'
a man of an overgrown fortune, not being able to
consume more than another, must share it with those
<PB N="199" REF="199"/>
who serve and attend him; yet their possession being
precarious, they have not the same encouragement to
marriage, as if each had a small fortune, secure and
independent. Enormous cities are, besides, destruc∣tive
to society, beget vice and disorder of all kinds,
starve the remoter provinces, and even starve them∣selves,
by the price to which they raise all provisions.
Where each man had his little house and field to him∣self,
and each county had its capital, free and in∣dependent;
what a happy situation of mankind▪
How favourable to industry and agriculture; to mar∣riage
and propagation! The prolific virtue of men,
were it to act in its full extent, without that restraint
which poverty and necessity imposes on it, would
double the number every generation: And nothing
surely can give it more liberty, than such small com∣mon-wealths,
and such an equality of fortune among
the citizens. All small states naturally produce equa∣lity
of fortune, because they afford no opportunities
of great increase; but small commonwealths much
more, by that division of power and authority which
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s essential to them.</P>
<P>WHEN XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>De exp.</HI> CYR. lib. 7.</NOTE> returned after the famous ex∣pedition

<P><PB N="201" REF="201"/>
IT must be owned, that the situation of affairs in
modern times, with regard to civil liberty, as well
as equality of fortune, is not near so favourable, either
to the propagation or happiness of mankind. EU∣ROPE
is shared out mostly into great monarchies; and
such parts of it as are divided into small territories,
are commonly governed by absolute princes, who ruin
their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater
monarchs, in the splendor of their court and number
of their forces. SWISSERLAND alone and HOLLAND
resemble the antient republics; and tho' the former is
far from possessing any advantage either of soil, cli∣mate,
or commerce, yet the numbers of people, with
which it abounds, notwithstanding their inlisting
themselves into every service in EUROPE, prove suf∣ficiently
the advantages of their political institu∣tions.</P>
<P>THE antient republics derived their chief or only
security from the numbers of their citizens. The
TRACHINIANS having lost great numbers of their
people, the remainder, instead of inriching themselves
by the inheritance of their fellow-citizens, applied to
SPARTA, their metropolis, for a new stock of inha∣bitants.
The SPARTANS immediately collected ten
thousand men: among whom the old citizens di∣vided
the lands of which the former proprietors had
perished<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 12. THUCYD. lib. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="202"/>
AFTER TIMOLEON had banished DIONYSIUS from
SYRACU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E, and had settled the affairs of SICILY,
finding the cities of SYRACUSE and SELLINUN∣TIUM
extremely depopulated by tyranny, war, and
faction, he invited over from GREECE some new in∣habitants
to repeople them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 16.</NOTE>. Immediately forty
thousand men (PLUTARCH<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In vita <HI>TIMOL.</HI></NOTE> says sixty thousand) of∣fered
themselves; and he distributed so many lots of
land among them, to the great satisfaction of the an∣tient
inhabitants: A proof at once of the maxims of
antient policy, which affected populousness more than
riches; and of the good effects of these maxims, in
the extreme populousness of that small country,
GREECE, which could at once supply so large a co∣lony.
The case was not much different with the
ROMANS in early times. He is a pernicious citizen,
said M. CURIUS, who cannot be contented with se∣ven
acres<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">PLIN. lib. 18. cap. 3.

The new nobles who rose in their place, were less splendid, as we learn from TACIT. <HI>ann.</HI> lib. 3. cap. 55.</NOTE>. Such ideas of equality could not fail of
producing great numbers of people.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="203"/>
WE must now consider what disadvantages the an∣tients
lay under with regard to populousness, and
what checks they received from their political ma∣xims
and institutions. There are commonly com∣pensations
in every human condition; and tho' these
compensations be not always perfectly equal, yet they
serve, at least, to restrain the prevailing principle. To
compare them and estimate their influence, is indeed
very difficult, even where they take place in the same
age, and in neighbouring countries: But where seve∣ral
ages have intervened, and only scattered lights are
afforded us by antient authors; what can we do but
amuse ourselves by talking, <HI>pro</HI> and <HI>c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> on an inter∣esting
subject, and thereby correcting all hasty and
violent determinations?</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> WE may observe, that the antient republics
were almost in perpetual war; a natural effect of
their martial spirit, their love of liberty, their mutual
emulation, and that hatred which generally prevails
among nations that live in a close neighbourhood.
Now, war in a small state is much more destructive
than in a great one; both because all the inhabitants,
in the former case, must serve in the armies; and be∣cause
the state is all frontier, and all exposed to the
inroads of the enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="204"/>
THE maxims of antient war were much more de∣structive
than those of modern; chiefly by the dis∣tribution
of plunder, in which the soldiers were indul∣ged.
The private men in our armies are such a low
rascally set of people, that we find any abundance be∣yond
their simple pay, breeds confusion and disorder,
and a total dissolution of discipline. The very
wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the mo∣dern
armies, render them less destructive to the coun∣tries
which they invade: One instance, among many,
of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political
reasonings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The antient soldiers, being free citizens, above the lowest rank, were all married. Our modern soldiers are either forced to live unmarried, or their marriages turn to small account to∣wards the increase of mankind. A circumstance which ought, perhaps, to be taken into consideration, as of some consequence in favour of the antients.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the
very nature of the weapons employed in them. The
antients drew up their men 16 or 20, sometimes 50
men deep, which made a narrow front; and it was
not difficult to find a field, in which both armies
might be marshalled, and might engage with each
other. Even where any body of the troops was kept
off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the
battle was not so soon decided betwixt the contending
parties, but that the others had time to overcome the
<PB N="205" REF="205"/>
difficulties which opposed them, and take part in the
engagement. And as the whole armies were thus en∣gaged,
and each man closely buckled to his antago∣nist,
the battles were commonly very bloody, and great
slaughter was made on both sides, but especially on
the vanquished. The long thin lines required by fire-arms,
and the quick decision of the fray, render our
modern engagements but partial rencounters, and en∣able
the general, who is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oiled in the beginning of
the day, to draw off the greatest part of his army,
sound and intire. Could FOLARD's project of the
column take place (which seems impracticable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">What is the advantage of the column after it has broke the enemy's line? only, that it then takes them in flank, and dissipates whatever stands near it by a fire from all sides.

would render modern battles as destructive as the
antient.</P>
<P>THE battles of antiquity, both by their duration,
and their resemblance of single combats, were wrought
up to a degree of fury quite unknown to latter ages.
Nothing could then engage the combatants to give
quarter, but the hopes of profit, by making slaves of
their prisoners. In civil wars, as we learn from
TACITUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. lib. 2. cap. 44.</NOTE>, the battles were the most bloody, because
the prisoners were not slaves.</P>

vanquished expected so hard a fate! How inveterate
the rage, where the maxims of war were, in every
respect, so bloody and severe!</P>
<P>INSTANCES are very frequent, in antient history,
of cities besieged, whose inhabitants, rather than open
their gates, murdered their wives and children, and
rushed themselves on a voluntary death, sweetened
perhaps with a little prospect of revenge upon the
enemy. GREEKS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As ABYDUS, mentioned by LIVY, lib. 31. cap. 17, 18. and POLYB. lib. 16.

destructive to human society, in those petty common∣wealths,
which lived in a close neighbourhood, and
were engaged in perpetual wars and contentions.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES the wars in GREECE, says PLU∣TARCH<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">In vita <HI>ARATI.</HI></NOTE>, were carried on intirely by inroads, and
robberies, and piracies. Such a method of war must
be more destructive, in small states, than the bloodiest
battles and sieges.</P>

were more unfavourable than the modern, not only in
times of war, but also in those of peace; and that too
in every respect, except the love of civil liberty and
equality, which is, I own, of considerable import∣ance.
To exclude faction from a free government, is
very difficult, if not altogether impracticable; but
such inveterate rage between the factions, and such
bloody maxims, are found, in modern times, amongst
religious parties alone, where bigotted priests are the
accusers, judges, and executioners. In antient his∣tory,
we may always observe, where one party pre∣vailed,
whether the nobles or people (for I can ob∣serve

butchered all of the opposite party who fell
into their hands, and banished such as had been so
fortunate as to escape their fury. No form of pro∣cess,
no law, no trial, no pardon. A fourth, a third,
perhaps near a half of the city, were slaughtered, or
expelled, every revolution; and the exiles always
joined foreign enemies, and did all the mischief pos∣sible
to their fellow-citizens; till Fortune put it in
their power to take full revenge by a new revolution.
And as these were very frequent in such violent go∣vernments,
the disorder, diffidence, jealousy, enmity,
which must prevail, are not easy for us to imagine in
this age of the world.</P>
<P>THERE are only two revolutions I can recollect in
antient history, which passed without great severity,
and great effusion of blood in massacres and assassina∣tions,
<HI>viz.</HI> the restoration of the ATHENIAN Demo∣cracy
by THRASYBULUS, and the subduing the RO∣MAN
republic by CAESAR. We learn from antient
history, that THRASYBULUS passed a general am∣nesty
for all past offences; and first introduced that
word, as well as practice, into GREECE<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">CICERO, PHILIP. 1.</NOTE>. It ap∣pears,
<PB N="209" REF="209"/>

that the chief, and even some of the subaltern of∣fenders,
in the preceding tyranny, were tried, and
capitally punished. This is a difficulty not cleared
up, and even not observed by antiquarians and histo∣rians.
And as to CAESAR's clemency, tho' much ce∣lebrated,
it would not gain great applause in the pre∣sent
age. He butchered, for instance, all CATO's
senate, when he became master of UTICA<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">APPIAN. <HI>de bell. civ.</HI> lib. 2.</NOTE>; and
these, we may readily believe, were not the most
worthless of the party. All those who had borne
arms against that usurper, were forfeited; and, by
HIRTIUS's law, declared incapable of all public
offices.</P>
<P>THESE people were extremely fond of liberty; but
seem not to have understood it very well. When the
thirty tyrants first established their dominion at ATHENS,
they began with seizing all the sycophants and in∣formers,
who had been so troublesome during the De∣mocracy,
and putting them to death by an arbitrary
sentence and execution. <HI>Every man,</HI> says SALLUST<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See CAESAR's speech, <HI>de b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. Catil.</HI></NOTE>

<P>THE utmost energy of the nervous style of THU∣CYDIDES,
and the copiousness and expression of the
GREEK language, seem to sink under that historian,
when he attempts to describe the disorders which arose
from faction thro'out all the GREEK commonwealths.
You would imagine, that he still labours with a
thought greater than he can find words to communicate.
And he concludes his pathetic description with an ob∣servation,
which is at once very refined and very solid.
“In these contests,” says he, “those who were dull∣est
and most stupid, and had the least foresight,
commonly prevailed. For being conscious of this
weakness, and dreading to be over-reached by
those of greater penetration, they went to work
hastily, without premed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tation, by the sword and

XENOPHON, in the banquet of SOCRATES, gives us
a very natural unaffected description of the tyranny
of the ATHENIAN people. “In my poverty,” says
CHARMIDES, “I am much more happy than ever I
was while possest of riches; as much as it is happier
to be in security than in terrors, free than a slave, to
receive than to pay court, to be trusted than sus∣pected.
Formerly I was obliged to caress every in∣former;
some imposition was continually laid upon
me; and it was never allowed me to travel, or be
absent from the city. At present, when I am poor,
I look big, and threaten others. The rich are
afraid of me, and show me every kind of civility
and respect; and I am become a kind of tyrant in

<P>IN one of the pleadings of LYSIAS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at. 29. in</HI> NICOM.</NOTE>, the orator
very coolly speaks of it, by the by, as a maxim of the

<P>I NEED not insist on the GREEK tyrannies, which
were altogether horrible. Even the mixed monarchies,
by which most of the antient states of GREECE were
governed, before the introduction of republics, were
very unsettled. Scarce any city, but ATHENS, says
ISOCRATES, could show a succession of kings for four
or five generations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Panath.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BESIDES many other obvious reasons for the instabi∣lity
of ancient monarchies, the equal division of proper∣ty
among the brothers in private families, must, by a
necessary consequence, contribute to unsettle and
disturb the state. The universal preference given to
the elder by modern laws, tho' it increases the ine∣quality
of fortunes, has, however, this good effect,
that it accustoms men to the same idea of public suc∣cession,
and cuts off all claim and pretension of the
younger.</P>
<P>THE new settled colony of HERACLEA, falling
immediately into factions, applied to SPARTA, who
sent HERIPIDAS with full authority to quiet their
dissensions. This man, not provoked by any opposi∣tion,
not inflamed by party rage, knew no better ex∣pedient
than immediately putting to death about 500
<PB N="217" REF="217"/>
of the citizens<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 14.</NOTE>. A strong proof how deeply rooted
these violent maxims of government were thro'out all
GREECE.</P>
<P>IF such was the disposition of mens minds among
that refined people, what may be expected in the
commonwealths of ITALY, AFRIC, SPAIN, and
GAUL, which were denominated barbarous? Why
otherwise did the Greeks so much value themselves on
their humanity, gentleness and moderation, above all
other nations? This reasoning seems very natural.
But unluckily the history of the ROMAN common∣wealth,
in its earlier times, if we give credit to the re∣ceived
accounts, stands against us. No blood was
ever shed in any sedition at ROME, till the murder of
the GRACCHI. DIONYSIUS HA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ICARNASSAEUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. I.</NOTE>,
Observing the singular humanity of the ROMAN peo∣ple
in this particular, makes use of it as an argument
that they were originally of GRECIAN extraction:
Whence we may conclude, that the factions and re∣volutions
in the barbarous republics were more violent
than even those of GREECE above-mentioned.</P>
<P>IF the ROMANS were so late in coming to blows,
they made ample compensation after they had once
entered upon the bloody scene; and APPIAN's history
of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture
of massacres, proscriptions, and forfeitures, that ever
<PB N="218" REF="218"/>
was presented to the world. What pleases most, in
that historian, is, that he seems to feel a proper re∣sentment
of these barbarous proceedings; and talks
not with that provoking coolness and indifference,
which custom had produced in many of the GREEK
historians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"> The authorities cited above, are all historians, orators, and philosophers, whose testimony is unquestioned. 'Tis dangerous to rely upon writers who deal in ridicule and fatyr. What will posserity, for instance, infer from this passage of Dr. SWIFT? “I told him, that in the kingdom of TRIBNIA (BRITAIN) by the natives called LANGDON (LONDON) where I had sojourned some time in my travels, the bulk of the people consist, in a manner, wholly of discoverers, witnesses, inform∣ers, accusers, prosecutors, evidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments, all under the colours, the conduct, and pay of ministers of state and their deputies.

Yet the Doctor's sa∣tyr, tho' carried to extremes, as is usual with him, even beyond other satyrical writers, did not altogether want an object. The Bishop of ROCHESTER, who was his friend, and of the same party, had been banished a little before by a bill of attainder, with great justice, but without such a proof as was legal, or ac∣cording to the strict forms of common law.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE maxims of antient politics contain, in general,
so little humanity and moderation, that it seems su∣perfluous
<PB N="219" REF="219"/>
to give any particular reason for the violen∣ces
committed at any particular period. Yet I can∣not
forbear observing, that the laws, in the latter ages
of the ROMAN commonwealth, were so absurdly con∣trived,
that they obliged the heads of parties to have
recourse to these extremities. All capital punishments
were abolished: However criminal, or, what is more,
however dangerous any citizen might be, he could not
regularly be punished otherwise than by banishment:
And it became necessary, in the revolutions of party,
to draw the sword of private vengeance; nor was it
easy, when laws were once violated, to set bounds to
these sanguinary proceedings. Had BRUTUS himself
prevailed over the <HI>triumvirate,</HI> could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, in common
prudence, have allowed OCTAVIUS and ANTHONY
to live, and have contented himself with banishing
them to RHODES or MARSEILLES, where they might
still have plotted new commotions and rebellions.
His executing C. ANTONIUS, brother to the <HI>triumvir,</HI>
shows evidently his sense of the matter. Did not
CICERO, with the approbation of all the wise and
virtuous of ROME, arbitrarily put to death CATI∣LINE's
associates, contrary to law, and without any
trial or form of process? And if he moderated his ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cutions,
did it not proceed, either from the clemency
of his temper, or the conjunctures of the times? A
wre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched security in a government which pretends to
laws and liberty!</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="220"/>
THUS, one extreme produces another. In the
same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to
beget great relaxation in their execution; so their ex∣cessive
lenity naturally produces cruelty and barbarity.
'Tis dangerous to force us, in any case, to pass their
sacred boundaries.</P>
<P>ONE general cause of the disorders so frequent in all
antient governments, seems to have consisted in the
great difficulty of establishing any Aristocracy in those
ages, and the perpetual discontents and seditions of
the people, whenever even the meanest and most beg∣garly
were excluded from the legislature and from
public offices. The very quality of <HI>freeman</HI> gave such
a rank, being opposed to that of slave, that it seemed
to intitle the possessor to every power and privilege of
the commonwealth. SOLON's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCHUS <HI>in vita</HI> SOLON.</NOTE> laws excluded no free∣man
from votes or elections, but confined some ma∣gistracies
to a particular <HI>census;</HI> yet were the people
never satisfied till those laws were repealed. By the
treaty with ANTIPATER<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 18.</NOTE>, no ATHENIAN had a
vote whose <HI>census</HI> was less than 2000 <HI>drachmas</HI> (about
60 <HI>l. Sterling</HI>) And tho' such a government would to
us appear sufficiently democratical, it was so disagree∣able
to that people, that above two thirds immediately
left their country<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>. CASSANDER reduced that <HI>census</HI>
<PB N="221" REF="221"/>
to the half<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 18.</NOTE>; yet still the government was considered
as an oligarchical tyranny, and the effect of foreign
violence.</P>
<P>SERVIU<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> TULLIUS's<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">TIT. LIV. lib. 1. cap. 43.</NOTE> laws seem very equal and
reasonable, by fixing the power in proportion to the
property: Yet the ROMAN people could never be
brought quietly to submit to them.</P>
<P>IN those days there was no medium between a severe,
jealous Aristocracy, ruling over discontented subjects;
and a turbulent, factious, tyrannical Democracy.</P>
<P>BUT, <HI>thirdly,</HI> there are many other circumstances,
in which antient nations seem inferior to the modern,
both for the happiness and increase of mankind.
Trade, manufactures, industry, were no where, in
former ages, so flourishing as they are at present in
EUROPE. The only garb of the antients, both for
males and females, seems to have been a kind of
flannel, which they wore commonly white or grey,
and which they scoured as osten as it grew dirty.
TYRE, which carried on, after CARTHAGE, the
greatest commerce of any city in the MEDITER∣RANEAN,

AMONG the other inconveniencies which the ATHE∣NIANS
felt from the fortifying DECELIA by the LA∣CEDEMONIANS,
it is represented by THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>,
as one of the most considerable, that they could not
bring over their corn from EUBEA by land, passing
by OROPUS; but were obliged to imbark it, and to
sail about the promontory of SUNIUM. A surprising
instance of the imperfection of antient navigation:
For the water-carriage is not here above double the
land.</P>
<P>I Do not remember any passage in any antient au∣thor,
where the growth of any city is ascribed to the
establishment of a manufacture. The commerce which
is said to flourish, is chiefly the exchange of those
commodities for which different soils and climates
were suited. The sale of wine and oil into AFRICA,
according to DIODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 13.</NOTE>, was the foun∣dation
of the riches of AGRIGENTUM. The situ∣ation
of the city of SYBARIS, according to the same
author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12.</NOTE>, was the cause of its immense populousness;
being built near the two rivers CRATHYS and SYBA∣RIS.
But these two rivers, we may observe, are not
navigable; and could only produce some fertile val∣leys,
for agriculature and husbandry; an advantage so
inconsiderable, that a modern writer would scarcely
have taken notice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="225"/>
THE barbarity of the antient tyrants, together with
the extreme love of liberty, which animated those
ages, must have banished every merchant and manu∣facturer;
and have quite depopulated the state, had it
subsisted upon industry and commerce. While the
cruel and suspicious DIONYSIUS was carrying on his
butcheries, who, that was not detained by his landed
property, and could have carried with him any art
or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries,
would have remained exposed to such implacable
barbarity? The persecutions of PHILIP II. and LEWIS
XIV. filled all EUROPE with the manufacturers of
FLANDERS and of FRANCE.</P>
<P>I GRANT, that agriculture is the species of industry
which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence of mul∣titudes;
and it is possible, that this industry may
flourish, even where manufactures and other arts are
unknown or neglected. SWISSERLAND is at present a
very remarkable instance; where we find, at once, the
most skilful husbandmen and the most bungling trades∣men,
that are to be met with in all EUROPE. That
agriculture flourished mightily in GREECE and ITA∣LY,
at least in some parts of them, and at some pe∣riods,
we have reason to presume: And whether the
mechanical arts had reached the same degree of per∣fection,
may not be esteemed so material; especially,
if we consider the great equality in the antient re∣publics,
where each family was obliged to cultivate,
<PB N="226" REF="226"/>
with the greatest care and industry, its own little field,
in order to its subsistence.</P>
<P>BUT is it just reasoning, because agriculture may, in
some instances, flourish without trade or manufactures,
to conclude, that, in any great extent of country,
and for any great tract of time, it would subsist alone?
The most natural way, surely, of encouraging hus∣bandry,
is, first, to excite other kinds of industry,
and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his
commodities, and a return of such goods as may con∣tribute
to his pleasure and enjoyment. This method
is infallible and universal; and as it prevails more in
modern government than in the antient, it affords a
presumption of the superior populousness of the former.</P>
<P>EVERY man, says XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oecon.</NOTE>, may be a farmer:
No art or skill is requisite: All consists in the industry,
and attention to the execution. A strong proof, as
COLUMELLA hints, that agriculture was but little
known in the age of XENOPHON.</P>
<P>ALL our latter improvements and refinements, have
they operated nothing towards the easy subsistence of
men, and consequently towards their propagation and
increase? Our superior skill in mechanics, the dis∣covery
of new worlds, by which commerce has been
so much enlarged, the establishment of posts, and
<PB N="227" REF="227"/>
the use of bills of exchange. These seem all extremely
useful to the encouragement of art, industry, and po∣pulousness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Were we to strike off these, what a
check should we give to every kind of business and
labour, and what multitudes of families would imme∣diately
perish from want and hunger? And it seems
not probable, that we could supply the place of these
new inventions by any other regulation or insti∣tution.</P>
<P>HAVE
we reason to think, that the police of an∣tient
states was any way comparable to that of mo∣dern,
or that men had then equal security, either at
home, or in their journies by land or water? I
question not, but every impartial examiner would give
us the preference in this particular<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Part I. Essay XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, upon comparing the whole, it seems im∣possible
to assign any just reason, why the world should
have been more populous in antient than in modern
times. The equality of property, among the anti∣ents,
liberty, and the small divisions of their states,
were indeed favourable to the propagation of man∣kind:
But their wars were more bloody and destruc∣tive,
their governments more factious and unsettled,
commerce and manufactures more feeble and languish∣ing,
and the general police more loose and irregular.
These latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient
<PB N="228" REF="228"/>
counterbalance to the former advantage; and rather
favour the opposite opinion to that which commonly
prevails with regard to this subject.</P>
<P>BUT there is no reasoning, it may be said, against
matter of fact. If it appear, that the world was then
more populous than at present, we may be assured,
that our conjectures are false, and that we have over-looked
some material circumstance in the comparison.
This I readily own: All our preceding reasonings, I
acknowledge to be mere tri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing, or, at least, small
skirmishes and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rivolous rencounters, which decide no∣thing.
But unluckily the main combat, where we
compare facts, cannot be rendered much more deci∣sive.
The facts delivered by antient authors, are
either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us no∣thing
positive in this matter. How indeed could it
be otherwise? The very facts which we must oppose
to them, in computing the greatness of modern states,
are far from being either certain or compleat. Many
grounds of calculation, proceeded on by celebrated
writers, are little better than those of the Emperor
HELIOGABALUS, who formed an estimate of the im∣mense
greatness of ROME, from ten thousand pound
weight of cobwebs which had been found in that
city<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AELII LA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>RID. <HI>in vita</HI> HELIOGA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. cap. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="229"/>
'TIS to be remarked, that all kinds of numbers are
uncertain in antient manuscripts, and have been sub∣ject
to much greater corruptions than any other part
of the text; and that for a very obvious reason. Any
alteration, in other places, commonly affects the sense
or grammar, and is more readily perceived by the
reader and transcriber.</P>
<P>FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made
of any tract of country by any antient author of good
authority, so as to afford us a large enough view for
comparison.</P>
<P>'TIS probables, that there was formerly a good foun∣dation
for the number of citizens assigned to any free
city; because they entered for a share of the govern∣ment,
and there were exact registers kept of them.
But as the number of slaves is seldom mentioned,
this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever, with re∣gard
to the populousness even of single cities.</P>
<P>THE first page of THUCYDIDES is, in my opinion,
the commencement of real history. All preceding
narrations are so intermixed with fable, that philoso∣phers
ought to abandon them, in a great measure, to
the embellishment of poets and orators<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In general, there is more candour and sincerity in antient historians, but less exactness and care, than in the moderns. Our speculative factions, especially those of religion, throw such an illu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion over our minds, that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics, as a vice or weakness: But the commonness of books, by means of printing, has obliged modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incongruities. DIODORUS SICULUS is a good writer; but 'tis with pain I see his narration contradict, in so many particu∣lars, the two most authentic pieces of all GREEK history, <HI>viz.</HI> XENOPHON's expedition, and DEMOSTHENES's orations.

<P><PB N="230" REF="230"/>
WITH regard to remote times, the numbers of
people assigned are often ridiculous, and lose all cre∣dit
and authority. The free citizens of SYBARIS, able
to bear arms, and actually drawn out in battle, were
300,000. They encountred at SIAGRA with 100,000
citizens of CROTONA, another GREEK city contigu∣ous
to them; and were de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eated. This is DIODORUS
SICULUS's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12.</NOTE> account; and is very seriously insisted on
by that historian. STRABO<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6.</NOTE> also mentions the same
number of SYBARITES.</P>
<P>DIDODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 13.</NOTE>, enumerating the inhabi∣tants
of AGRIGENTUM, when it was destroyed by
the CARTHAGINIANS, says, that they amounted to
20,000 citizens, 200,000 strangers, besides slaves,
who, in so opulent a city as he represents it, would
<PB N="231" REF="231"/>
probably be, at least, as numerous. We must remark,
that the women and the children are not included;
and that therefore, upon the whole, the city must have
contained near two millions of inhabitants<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">DIOGENES LA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RTIUS (<HI>in vita</HI> EMPEDOCLIS) says, that AGRIGENTUM contained only 800,000 inhabitants.</NOTE>. And
what was the reason of so immense an increase?
They were very industrious in cultivating the neigh∣bouring
fields, not exceeding a small ENGLISH coun∣ty;
and they traded with their wine and oil to AFRI∣CA,
which, at that time, had none of these com∣modities.</P>
<P>PTOLEMY, says THEOCRITUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Idyll. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE>, commands 33,339
cities. I suppose the singularity of the number was
the reason of assigning it. DIODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>
assigns three millions of inhabitants to AEGYPT, a
very small number: But then he makes the number
of their cities amount to 18,000: An evident con∣tradiction.</P>
<P>HE says<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>, the people were formerly seven mil∣lions.
Thus remote times are always most envied
and admired.</P>
<P>THAT XERXES's army was extremely numerous,
I can readily believe; both from the great extent of
<PB N="232" REF="232"/>
his empire, and from the foolish practice of the East∣ern
nations, of encumbering their camp with a super∣fluous
multitude: But will any reasonable man cite
HERODOTUS's wonderful narrations as an authority?
There is something very rational, I own, in LYSIAS's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t funebris.</NOTE>
argument upon this subject. Had not XERXES's army
been incredibly numerous, says he, he had never made
a bridge over the HELLESPONT: It had been much
easier to have transported his men over so short a
passage, with the numerous shipping of which he was
master.</P>
<P>POLYBIUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE> says, that the ROMANS, between the
first and second PUNIC wars, being threatened with
an invasion from the GAULS, mustered all their own
forces, and those of their allies, and found them
amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear
arms. A great number surely, and which, when
joined to the slaves, is probably not less, if not rather
more than that extent of country affords at present<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The country that supplied this number, was not above a third of ITALY, <HI>viz.</HI> Pope's dominions, TUSCANY, and a part of the kingdom of NAPLESS But perhaps in those early times there were very few slaves, except in ROME or the greatcities.</NOTE>.
The enumeration too seems to have been made with
some exactness; and POLYBIUS gives us the detail of
<PB N="233" REF="233"/>
the particulars. But might not the number be mag∣nified,
in order to encourage the people?</P>
<P>DIODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib 2.</NOTE>, makes the same enumera∣tion
amount to near a million. These variations are
suspicious. He plainly too supposes, that ITALY
in his time was not so populous: Another very sus∣picious
circumstance. For who can believe, that the
inhabitants of that country diminished from the time
of the first PUNIC war to that of the <HI>triumvirates?</HI></P>
<P>JULIUS CAESAR, according to APPIAN<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">CELTICA.</NOTE>, encoun∣tered
four millions of GAULS, killed one million, and
took another million prisoners<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH (<HI>in vita</HI> CAES.) makes the number that CAESAR <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought with amount only to three millions; JULIAN.

of the enemy's army and of the killed could be
exactly assigned, which never is possible; how could
it be known how often the same man returned into
the armies, or how distinguish the new from the old
levied soldiers? No attention ought ever to be given
to such loose, exaggerated calculations; especially
where the author tells us not the mediums upon which
the calulations were formed.</P>
<P>PATERCULUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 47.</NOTE> makes the number killed by CAE∣SAR
amount only to 400,000: A much more pro∣bable
<PB N="234" REF="234"/>
account, and more easily reconciled to the his∣tory
of these wars given by that conqueror himself
in his Commentaries.</P>
<P>ONE would imagine, that every circumstance of
the life and actions of DIONYSIUS the elder might
be regarded as authentic, and free from all fabulous
exaggeration; both because he lived at a time when
letters flourished most in GREECE, and because his
chief historian was PHILISTUS, a man allowed to be
of great genius, and who was a courtier and minister
of that prince. But can we admit, that he had a
standing army of 100,000 <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot, 10,000 horse, and a
fleet of 400 gallies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 2.</NOTE>? These, we may observe, were
mercenary forces, and subsisted upon their pay, like
our armies in EUROPE. For the citizens were all dis∣armed;
and when DION afterwards invaded SICILY,
and called on his countrymen to vindicate their liber∣ty,
he was obliged to bring arms along with him,
which he distributed among those who joined him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH, <HI>in vita</HI> DIONIS.</NOTE>.
In a state where agriculture alone flourishes, there
may be many inhabitants; and if these be all armed
and disciplined, a great force may be called out up∣on
occasion: But great numbers of mercenary troops
can never be maintained, without either trade and
<PB N="235" REF="235"/>
manufactures, or very extensive dominions. The
United Provinces never were masters of such a force
by sea and land, as that which is said to belong to
DIONYSIUS; yet they possess as large a territory, per∣fectly
well cultivated, and have infinitely more re∣sources
from their commerce and industry. DIODORUS
SICULUS allows, that, even in his time, the army
of DIONYSIUS appeared incredible; that is, as I in∣terpret
it, it was entirely a fiction, and the opinion
arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers,
and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant
himself.</P>
<P>'TIS a very usual <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allacy, to consider all the ages

PHALEREUS, there were in ATHENS 21,000
citizens, 10,000 strangers, and 400,000 slaves. This
<PB N="237" REF="237"/>
number is very much insisted on by those whose opi∣nion
I call in question, and is esteemed a fundamen∣tal
fact to their purpose: But, in my opinion, there
is no point of criticism more certain, than that ATHE∣NAEUS,
and CTESICLES, whom he cites, are here
mistaken, and that the number of slaves is augmented
by a whole cypher, and ought not to be regarded as
more than 40,000.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> WHEN the number of citizens is said to be
21,000 by ATHENAEUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DEMOST<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S assigns 20,000; <HI>contra</HI> ARISTOG.</NOTE>, men of full age are only
understood. For, (1.) HERODOTUS says<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5.</NOTE>, that
ARISTAGORAS, ambassador from the IONIANS, found
it harder to deceive one SPARTAN than 30,000
ATHENIANS; meaning, in a loose way, the whole
state, supposed to be met in one popular assembly,
excluding the women and children. (2.) THUCY∣DIDES
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 8</NOTE> says, that, making allowance for all the ab∣sentees
in the fleet, army, garrisons, and for people
employed in their private affairs, the ATHENIAN as∣sembly
never rose to five thousand. (3.) The forces
enumerated by the same historian<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. DIODORUS SICULUS's account perfectly agrees, lib. 12.</NOTE>, being all citizens,
and amounting to 13,000 heavy-armed infantry, prove
the same method of calculation; as also the whole
<PB N="238" REF="238"/>
tenor of the GREEK historians, who always under∣stand
men of full age, when they assign the number
of citizens in any republic. Now, these being but the
fourth of the inhabitants, the free ATHENIANS were
by this account 84,000; the strangers 40,000; and
the slaves, calculating by the smaller number, and
allowing that they married and propagated at the same
rate with freemen, were 160,000; and the whole in∣habitants
284,000: A large enough number surely.
The other number, 1,720,000, makes ATHENS
larger than LONDON and PARIS united.</P>

number of ATHENAEUS.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> THE whole <HI>census</HI> of the state of ATHENS
was less than 6000 talents. And tho' numbers in an∣tient
manuscripts be often suspected by critics, yet
this is unexceptionable; both because DEMOSTHENES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De classibus.</NOTE>,
who gives it, gives also the detail, which checks him;
and because POLYBIUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 62.</NOTE> assigns the same number,
and reasons upon it. Now, the most vulgar slave
could yield by his labour an <HI>obolus</HI> a-day, over and
above his maintenance, as we learn from XENOPHON<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De rat. red.</NOTE>,
who says, that NICIAS's overseer paid his master so
much for slaves, whom he employed in digging of
mines. If you will take the pains to estimate an
<HI>obolus</HI> a-day, and the slaves at 400,000, computing
only at four years purchase, you will find the sum
above 12,000 talents; even tho' allowance be made
for the great number of holidays in ATHENS. Be∣sides,
many of the slaves would have a much greater
value from their art. The lowest that DEMOSTHE∣NES
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Contra</HI> APHOBUM:</NOTE> estimates any of his father's slaves, is two minas
a-head. And upon this supposition, it is a little dif∣ficult,
<PB N="242" REF="242"/>
I confess, to reconcile even the number of
40,000 slaves with the <HI>census</HI> of 6000 talents.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> CHIOS is said by THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 8.</NOTE>, to con∣tain
more slaves than any GREEK city, except SPAR∣TA.
SPARTA then had more than ATHENS, in pro∣portion
to the number of citizens. The SPARTANS
were 9000 in the town, 30,000 in the country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH, <HI>in vita</HI> LICURG.</NOTE>.
The male slaves, therefore, of full age, must have
been more than 780,000; the whole more than
3,120,000. A number impossible to be maintained
in a narrow barren country, such as LACONIA, which
had no trade. Had the HELOTES been so very nu∣merous,
the murder of 2000 mentioned by THUCY∣DIDES<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE>, would have irritated them, without weak∣ening
them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we are to consider, that the number as∣signed
by ATHENAEUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The same author affirms, that CORINTH had once 460,000 slaves, AEGINA 470,000. But the foregoing arguments hold stronger against these facts: 'Tis however remarkable, that ATHENAEUS cites so great an authority as ARISTOTLE for this last fact: And the scholiast on PINDAR mentions the same num∣ber of slaves in AEGINA.</NOTE>, whatever it is, comprehends
all the inhabitants of ATTICA, as well as those of
<PB N="243" REF="243"/>
ATHENS. The ATHENIANS affected much a coun∣try
life, as we learn from THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE>; and when
they were all chased into town, by the invasion of
their territory during the PELOPONNESIAN war, the
city was not able to contain them; and they were
obliged to lie in the porticoes, temples, and even
streets, for want of lodging<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">THUCYD. lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same remark is to be extended to all the
other GREEK cities; and when the number of the
citizens is assigned, we must always understand it of
the inhabitants of the neighbouring country, as well as
of the city. Yet, even with this allowance, it must be
confessed, that GREECE was a populous country, and
exceeded what we could imagine of so narrow a ter∣ritory,
naturally not very fertile, and which drew no
supplies of corn from other places. For excepting
ATHENS, which traded to PONTUS for that commo∣dity,
the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly
from their neighbouring territory<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">DEMOST. <HI>contra</HI> LEPT. The ATHENIANS brought yearly from PONTUS 400,000 medimni or bushels of corn, as appeared from the custom-house books. And this was the greatest part of their importation. This by the by is a strong proof that there is some great mistake in the foregoing passage of ATHE∣NAEUS. For ATTICA itself was so barren in corn, that it pro∣duced not enough even to maintain the peasants. TIT. LIV. lib. 43. cap. 6. LUCIAN, in his <HI>navigium sive vota,</HI> says, that a ship, which by the dimensions he gives, seems to have been about the size of our third rates, carried as much corn as would main∣tain all ATTICA for a twelvemonth. But perhaps ATHENS was decayed at that time; and besides, it is not safe to trust such loose rhetorical calculations.</NOTE>.</P>

RHODES is well known to have been a city of ex∣tensive
commerce, and of great fame and splendor;
yet it contained only 6000 citizens able to bear arms,
when it was besieged by DEMETRIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEBES was always one of the capital cities of
GREECE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">IS<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>CR. <HI>paneg.</HI></NOTE>: But the number of its citizens exceeded
not those of RHODES<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 17. When ALEXANDER attacked THEBES, we may safely conclude, that almost the whole inhabitants were present. Whoever is acquainted with the spirit of the GREEKS, especially of the THEBANS, will never suspect, that any of them would desert their country, when it was reduced to such extreme peril and distress. As ALEXANDER took the town by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>torm, all those who bore arms were put to the sword without mercy; and they amounted only to 6000 men. Among these were some strangers and manumitted slaves. The captives, con∣sisting of old men, women, children, and slaves, were sold, and they amounted to 30,000. We may therefore conclude that the free citizens in THEBES, of both sexes and all ages, were near 24,000; the strangers and slaves about 12,000. These last, we may observe, were somewhat fewer in proportion than at A∣THENS; as is reasonable to imagine from this circumstance, that ATHENS was a town of more trade to support slaves, and of more entertainment to allure strangers. It is also to be remarked, that thirty-six thousand was the whole number of people, both in the city of THEBES, and the neighbouring territory: A very moderate number, it must be confessed; and this computation being founded in facts which appear undisputable, must have great weight in the present controversy. The above-mentioned number of RHODIANS too were the whole inhabitants of the island, who were free, and able to bear arms.</NOTE>. PHLIASIA is said to be a
<PB N="245" REF="245"/>
small city by XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. GRAEC. lib. 7.</NOTE>, yet we find, that it con∣tained
6000 citizens<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 7.</NOTE>. I pretend not to reconcile
these two facts. Perhaps, XENOPHON calls PHLI∣ASIA
a small town, because it made but a small figure
in GREECE, and maintained only a subordinate alli∣ance
with SPARTA; or perhaps the country belong∣ing
to it, was extensive, and most of the citizens
were employed in the cultivation of it, and dwelt in
the neighbouring villages.</P>
<P>MANTINEA was equal to any city in ARCADIA<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">POLYB. lib. 2.</NOTE>:
Consequently it was equal to MEGALOPOLIS, which
was fifty stadia, or six miles and a quarter in circum∣ference<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">POLYB. lib. 9. cap. 20.</NOTE>.
<PB N="246" REF="246"/>
But MANTINAEA had only 3000 citizens<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">LYSIAS, orat. 34.</NOTE>.
The GREEK cities, therefore, contained often fields
and gardens, together with the houses; and we can∣not
judge of them by the extent of their walls. A∣thens
contained no more than 10,000 houses; yet its
walls, with the sea-coast, were above twenty miles in
extent. SYRACUSE was twenty-two miles in circum∣ference;
yet was scarce ever spoke of by the antients
as more populous than ATHENS. BABYLON was a
square of fifteen miles, or sixty miles in circuit; but
it contained large cultivated fields and inclosures, as
we learn from PLINY. Tho' AURELIAN's wall was
fifty miles in circumference<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">VOPISCUS <HI>in vita</HI> AUREL.</NOTE>; the circuit of all the
thirteen divisions of ROME, taken apart, according
to PUBLIUS VICTOR, was only about forty-three
miles. When an enemy invaded the country, the
whole inhabitants retired within the walls of the an∣tient
cities, with their cattle and furniture, and instru∣ments
of husbandry; and the great height to which
the walls were raised, enabled a small number to de∣fend
them with facility.</P>
<P>SPARTA, says XENOPHON<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>De rep.</HI> LACED. This passage is not easily reconciled with that of PLUTARCH above, who says, that SPARTA had 9000 citizens.</NOTE>, is one of the cities of
GREECE that has the fewest inhabitants. Yet POLY∣BIUS
<PB N="247" REF="247"/>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">POLYR. lib. 9. cap. 20.</NOTE> says, that it was forty-eight stadia in circum∣ference,

<P>ALL the AETOLIANS able to bear arms in ANTI∣PATER's

<P>POLYBIUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">LEGAT.</NOTE> tells us. that the ACHAEAN league
might, without any inconvenience, march 30 or 40,000

league comprehended the greatest part of PELOPON∣NESUS.
Yet PAUSANIAS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>In</HI> ACHAICIS.</NOTE>, speaking of the same
period, says, that all the ACHAEANS able to bear arms,
even when several manumitted slaves were joined to
them, did not amount to fifteen thousand.</P>
<P>THE THESSALIANS, till their final conquest by the
ROMANS, were, in all ages, turbulent, factious, se∣ditious,
disorderly<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">TIT. LIV. lib. 34. cap. 51. PLATO <HI>in</HI> CRITON<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. 'Tis not therefore natural to

in people.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="248"/>
WE are told by THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>, that the part of
PELOPONNESUS adjoining to PYLOS, was desart and
uncultivated. HERODOTUS says<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>, that MACEDO∣NIA
was full of lions and wild bulls; animals which
can only inhabit vast unpeopled forests. These were
the two extremities of GREECE.</P>
<P>THE whole inhabitants of EPIRUS, of all ages,
sexes and conditions, who were sold by PAULUS AE∣MILIUS,
amounted only to 150,000<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">TIT: Liv. lib. 45. cap. 34.</NOTE>. Yet EPIRUS
might be double the extent of YORKSHIRE.</P>
<P>JUSTIN<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 9. cap. 5.</NOTE> tells us, that when PHILIP of MACE∣DON
was declared head of the GREEK confederacy,
he called a congress of all the states, except the LA∣CEDEMONIANS,
who refused to concur; and he found
the force of the whole, upon computation, to amount
to 200,000 infantry, and 15,000 cavalry. This must
be understood to be all the citizens capable of bearing
arms. For as the GREEK republics maintained no
mercenary forces, and had no militia distinct from the
whole body of the citizens, it is not conceivable what
other medium there could be of computation. That
<PB N="249" REF="249"/>
such an army could ever by GREECE be brought into
the field, and be maintained there, is contrary to all
history. Upon this supposition, therefore, we may
thus reason. The free GREEKS of all ages and sexes
were 860,000. The slaves, estimating them by the
number of ATHENIAN slaves as above, who seldom
married or had families, were double the male citizens
of full age, <HI>viz.</HI> 430,000. And the whole inha∣bitants
of antient GREECE, excepting LACONIA,
were about one million two hundred and ninety
thousand: No mighty number, nor much exceeding
what may be found at present in SCOTLAND, a coun∣try
of not much greater extent, and very indifferently
peopled.</P>
<P>WE may now consider the numbers of people in
ROME and ITALY, and collect all the lights afforded
us by scattered passages in antient authors. We shall
find, upon the whole, a great difficulty in fixing any
opinion on that head; and no reason to support those
exaggerated calculations, so much insisted on by mo∣dern
writers.</P>
<P>DIONYSIUS HALLICARNASSAEUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE> says, that the
antient walls of ROME were nearly of the same com∣pass
with those of ATHENS, but that the suburbs ran
out to a great extent; and it was difficult to tell,
<PB N="250" REF="250"/>
where the town ended or the country begun. In some
places of ROME, it appears, from the same author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib: 10.</NOTE>,
from JUVENAL<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Satyr 3. l. 269, 270.</NOTE>, and from other antient writers<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">STRABO, lib. 5. says, that the emperor AUGUSTUS prohi∣bited the raising houses higher than seventy foot. In another passage, lib. 16, he speaks of the houses of ROME as remark∣ably high. See also to the same purpose VITRUVIUS, lib. 2. cap. 8. ARISTIDES the sophist, in his oration <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, says, that ROME consisted of cities on the top of cities; and that if one were to spread it out, and unfold it, it would cover the whole surface of ITALY. Where an author indulges himself in such extravagant declamations, and gives so much into the hyperboli∣cal style, one knows not how far he must be reduced. But this reasoning seems natural: If ROME was built in so scattered a manner as DIONYSIUS says, and ran so much into the country, there must have been very few streets where the houses were raised so high. 'Tis only for want of ground, that any body builds in that inconvenient manner.</NOTE>,
that the houses were high, and families lived in sepa∣rate
storeys, one above another: But it is probable,
that these were only the poorer citizens, and only in
some few streets. If we may judge from the younger
PLINY's<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. epist. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>6. lib. 5. epist. 6. 'Tis true, PLINY there describes a country-house: But since that was the idea which the antients formed of a magnificent and convenient building, the great men would certainly build the same way in town. “In laxitatem ruris excurrunt,” says SENECA of the rich and vo∣luptuous, epist. 114.

very spacious palaces; and their buildings were like
the CHINESE houses at this day, where each apart∣ment
is separated from the rest, and rises no higher
than a single storey. To which if we add, that the
ROMAN nobility much affected very extensive porti∣coes,
and even woods<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">VITRUV. lib. 5. cap. 11. TACIT. annal. lib. 11. cap. 3. SUETON. <HI>in vita</HI> OCTAV. cap. 72, &amp;c.</NOTE> in town; we may perhaps
allow VOSSIUS (tho' there is no manner of reason for
it) to read the famous passage of the elder PLINY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>“Moenia ejus (ROMAE) collegere ambitu imperatoribus, censoribusque VESPASIANIS, A. U. C. 828. pass. xiii. MCC. complexa montes septem, ipsa dividitur in regiones quatuorde∣cim, compita earum 265. Ejusdem spatii mensura, currente a milliario in capite ROM.

Quo si quis altitudinem tectorum ad∣dat, dignam profecto, aestimationem concipiat, fateaturque nullius urbis magnitudinem in toto orbe potuisse ei comparari.” PLIN. lib. 3. cap. 5.</P>
<P>All the best manuscripts of PLINY read the passage as here cited, and fix the compass of the walls of Rome to be thirteen miles. The question is, What PLINY means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed? The manner in which I con∣ceive it, is this. ROME was a semicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The Forum, and consequently the Milli∣arium, we know, was situated on the banks of the TYBER, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the semi∣circular area. Tho' there were thirty-seven gates to ROME, yet only twelve of them had straight streets, leading from them to the Milliarium. PLINY, therefore, having assigned the circum∣ference of ROME, and knowing that that alone was not suffi∣cient to give us a just notion of its surface, uses this farther me∣thod. He supposes all the streets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one straight line, and supposes we run along that line, so as to count each gate once: In which case, he says, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of ROME is five miles, and its breadth about half as much; besides the scattered suburbs.</P>
<P>PERE HARDOUIN understands this passage in the same man∣ner; with regard to the laying together the several streets of ROME into one line, in order to compose 30,775 paces: But then he supposes, that streets led from the Milliarium to every gate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that no street exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1.) a se∣micircular area, whose radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near thirteen miles, the compass of ROME as assigned by PLINY. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an absurdity in sup∣posing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. These streets must interfere as they approach. (3.) This diminishes too much from the great∣ness of antient ROME, and reduces that city below even BRIS∣TOL or ROTTERDAM.</P>
<P>The sense which VOSSIUS in his <HI>Observationes variae</HI> puts on this passage of PLINY, errs widely in the other extreme. One manuscript, of no authority, instead of thirteen miles, has as∣signed thirty miles for the compass of the walls of ROME. And VOSSIUS understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; supposing, that as the TYBER formed the dia∣meter, there were no walls built on that side. But (1.) this reading is allowed contrary to almost all the manuscripts. (2.) Why should PLINY, a concise writer, repeat the compass of the walls of ROME in two successive sentences? (3.) Why repeat it with so sensible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of PLINY'S mentioning twice the MILLIARIUM, if a line was measured that had no dependence on the MILLIARIUM? (5.) AURELIAN's wall is said by VOPISCUS to have been drawn <HI>laxi∣or <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bitu,</HI> and to have comprehended all the buildings and sub∣urbs on the north side of the TYBER; yet its compass was only fifty miles; and even here critics suspect some mistake or cor∣ruption in the text. It is not probable, that ROME would di∣minish from AUGUSTUS to AURELIAN. It remained still the capital of the same empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of MAXIMUS and BALBINUS ever affected the city. CARACALLA is said by AURELIUS VICTOR to have increased ROME. (6.) There are no remains of antient buildings, which mark any such greatness of ROME. VOSSIUS's reply to this objection seems absurd, That the rubbish would sink sixty or seventy feet below ground. It appears from SPARTIAN <HI>(in vita Severi)</HI> that the five-mile stone <HI>in via Lavicana</HI> was out of the city. (7.) OLYMPIODORUS and PUBLIUS VICTOR fix the number of houses in ROME to be betwixt forty and fifty thou∣sand. (8.) The very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic, as well as LIPSIUS, if they be necessary, destroys the foundation on which they are grounded: That ROME con∣tained fourteen milliens of inhabitants; while the whole king∣dom of FRANCE contains only five, according to his computa∣tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The only objection to the sense which we have affixed above to the passage of PLINY, seems to lie in this, That PLINY, after mentioning the thirty-seven gates of ROME, assigns only a reason for suppressing the seven old ones, and says nothing of the eighteen gates, the streets leading from which terminated, ac∣cording to my opinion, before they reached the Forum. But as PLINY was writing to the ROMANS, who perfectly knew the dis∣position of the streets, it is not strange he should take a circum∣stance for granted, which was so familiar to every body. Per∣haps, too, many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river.</P></NOTE>

THE number of citizens who received corn by the

such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and
uncertainty.</P>
<P>DID the poorer citizens only receive the distribu∣tion?
It was calculated, to be sure, chiefly for their
benefit. But it appears from a passage of CICERO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tusc. quaest.</HI> lib. 3. cap. 48.</NOTE>,
that the rich might also take their portion, and that
it was esteemed no reproach in them to apply for
it.</P>
<P>To whom was the corn given; whether only to
heads of families, or to every man, woman, and
child? The portion every month was five <HI>modii</HI> to
each<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Licinius apud Sallust. hist. frag.</HI> lib. 3.</NOTE>, (about ⅚ of a bushel.) This was too little

matter to be uncertain.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="256"/>
WAS it strictly inquired, whether the claimant lived
within the precincts of ROME, or was it sufficient that
he presented himself at the monthly distribution?
This last seems more probable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Not to take the people too much from their business, AU∣GUSTUS ordained the distribution of corn to be made only thrice a-year: But the people finding the monthly distributions more convenient, (as preserving, I suppose, a more regular oeco∣nomy in their family) desired to have them restored.

<P>BUT, lastly, what proportion of slaves must we
assign to these citizens? This is the most material
question; and the most uncertain. 'Tis very doubt∣ful,
whether ATHENS can be established as a rule
for ROME. Perhaps the ATHENIANS had more
slaves, because they employed them in manufactures,
for which a capital city, like ROME, seems not so
proper. Perhaps, on the other hand, the ROMANS
had more slaves, on account of their superior luxury
and riches.</P>

<P>THE best ground of conjecture I can find con∣cerning
the greatness of antient ROME, is this: We
are told by HERODIAN<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. cap. 5.</NOTE>, that ANTIOCH and ALEX∣ANDRIA
were very little inferior to ROME. It ap∣pears
from DIODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE>, that one straight
street of ALEXANDRIA, reaching from port to port,
was five miles long; and as ALEXANDRIA was much
more extended in length than breadth, it seems to
have been a city nearly of the bulk of PARIS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">QUINTUS CURTIUS says, its walls were only ten miles in circumference, when founded by ALEXANDER; lib. 4. cap. 8. STRABO, who had travelled to ALEXANDRIA, as well as DIODORUS SICULUS, says it was scarce four miles long, and in most places about a mile broad; lib. 17. PLINY says it resembled a MACEDONIAN cassock, stretching out in the cor∣ners; lib. 5. cap. 10. Notwithstanding this bulk of ALEXAN∣DRIA, which seems but moderate, DIODORUS SICULUS, speaking of its circuit as drawn by ALEXANDER (which it ne∣ver exceeded, as we learn from AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS, lib. 22. cap. 16.) says it was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>extremely great,</HI> ibid. The reason which he assigns for its surpassing all cities of the world (for he excepts not ROME) is, that it contained 300,000 free inhabitants. He also mentions the revenues of the kings, viz. 6000 talents, as another circumstance to the same purpose: No such mighty sum in our eyes, even tho' we make allowances for the different value of money. What STRABO says of the neighbouring country, means only that it was well peopled, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Might not one affirm, with∣out any great hyperbole, that the whole banks of the river from GRAVESEND to WINDSOR are one city? This is even more than STRABO says of the banks of the lake MAREOTIS, and of the canal to CANOPUS. 'Tis a vulgar saying in ITALY, that the king of SARDINIA has but one town in PIEDMONT; for it is all a town. AGRIPPA in JOSEPHUS <HI>de bello</HI> JUDAIC. lib. 2. cap. 16. to make his audience comprehend the excessive greatness of ALEXANDRIA, which he endeavours to magnify, describes only the compass of the city as drawn by ALEXAN∣DER: A clear proof that the bulk of the inhabitants were lodged there, and that the neighbouring country was no more than what might be expected about all great towns, very well cultivated, and well peopled.</NOTE>; and
ROME might be about the size of LONDON.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="258"/>
THERE lived in ALEXANDRIA, in DIODORUS SI∣CULUS's
time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE>, 300,000 free people, comprehend∣ing,
<PB N="259" REF="259"/>
I suppose, women and children<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">He says <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which last expression must have been understood of citizens alone, and grown men.</NOTE>. But what
number of slaves? Had we any just ground to fix
these at an equal number with the free inhabitants,
it would favour the foregoing calculation.</P>
<P>THERE is a passage in HERODIAN, which is a
little surprising. He says positively, that the palace
of the Emperor was as large as all the rest of the
city<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. cap. 1. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. POLITIAN interprets it “aedibus majoribus etiam reliqua urbe.”</NOTE>. This was NERO's golden house, which is
indeed represented by SUETONIUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><P>He says (in NERONE cap. 30.) that a portico or piazza of it was 3000 feet long; “tanta laxitas ut porticus triplices milliarias haberet.” He cannot mean three miles. For the whole extent of the house from the PALATINE to the ESQUI∣LINE was not near so great. So when VOPISC. in AURELI∣A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>O mentions a protico in SALLUST's gardens, which he calls <HI>porticus milliarensis,</HI> it must be understood of a thousand feet. So also HORACE;
<Q><L>“Nulla decempedis</L>
<L>Metata privatis opacam</L></Q></P>
<P>Porticus excipiebat Arcton.” Lib. 2. ode 15. So also in lib. 1. satyr. 8.</P>
<P>“Mille pedes in fronte, trecentos cippus in agrum Hic dabat.”</P></NOTE> and PLINY as of
an enormous extent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLINIUS, lib. 36. cap. 15. “Bis vidimus urbem totam cingi domibus principum, CAII ac NERONIS.”</NOTE>; but no power of imagination
<PB N="260" REF="260"/>
can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to
such a city as LONDON.</P>
<P>WE may observe, had the historian been relating
NERO's extravagance, and had he made use of such
an expression, it would have had much less weight;
these rhetorical exaggerations being so apt to creep
into an author's style, even when the most chaste and
correct. But 'tis mentioned by HERODIAN only by
the by, in relating the quarrels between GETA and
CARACALLA.</P>
<P>IT appears from the same historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 15.</NOTE>, that there was
then much land uncultivated. and put to no manner
of use; and he ascribes it as a great praise to PERTI∣NAX,
that he allowed every one to take such land,
either in ITALY or elsewhere, and cultivate it as he
pleased, without paying any taxes. <HI>Lands unculti∣vated,
and put to no manner of use!</HI> This is not heard
of in any part of CHRISTENDOM; except perhaps in
some remote parts of HUNGARY, as I have been in∣formed.
And it surely corresponds very ill with that
idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity, so much
insisted on.</P>
<P>WE learn from VOPISCUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In AURELIAN. cap. 48.</NOTE>, that there was in
ETRURIA much fertile land uncultivated, which the
<PB N="261" REF="261"/>
Emperor AURELIAN intended to convert into vine∣yards,
in order to furnish the ROMAN people with a
gratuitous distribution of wine: A very proper expe∣dient
to dispeople still farther that capital and all the
neighbouring territories.</P>
<P>IT may not be amiss to take notice of the ac∣count
which POLYBIUS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12. cap. 2.</NOTE> gives of the great herds of
swine to be met with in TUSCANY and LOMBARDY,
as well as in GREECE, and of the method of feeding
them which was then practised. “There are great
herds of swine,” says he, “thro'out all ITALY,
particularly, in former times, thro' ETRURIA and
CISALPINE GAUL. And a herd frequently con∣tains
a thousand or more swine. When one of
these herds in feeding meets with another, they
mix together; and the swine-herds have no other
expedient to separate them than to go to different
quarters, where they sound their horn; and these
animals, being accustomed to that signal, run im∣mediately
each to the horn of his own keeper.
Whereas in GREECE, if the herds of swine hap∣pen
to mix in the forests, he who has the greatest
flock, takes cunningly the opportunity of driving
all away. And thieves are very apt to purloin the
straggling hogs, which have wandered to a great
distance from their keeper in search of food.”</P>
<P><PB N="262" REF="262"/>
MAY we not infer from this account, that the
North of ITALY was then much less peopled, and
worse cultivated, than at present? How could these
vast herds be fed in a country so thick of inclosures,
so improved by agriculture, so divided by farms, so
planted with vines and corn intermingled together?
I must confess, that POLYBIUS's relation has more
the air of that oeconomy which is to be met with in
our AMERICAN colonies, than the management of an
EUROPEAN country.</P>
<P>WE meet with a reflection in ARISTOTLE'S<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 9. cap. 10. His expression is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; inhabitant, not citizen.</NOTE>
ethics, which seems to me unaccountable on any sup∣position,
and by proving too much in favour of our
present reasoning, may be thought really to prove
nothing. That philosopher, treating of friendship,
and observing, that that relation ought neither to be
contracted to a very few, nor extended over a great
multitude, illustrates his opinion by the following
argument. “In like manner,” says he, “as a city
cannot subsist, if it either have so few inhabitants
as ten, or so many as a hundred thousand; so is
there a mediocrity required in the number of
friends; and you destroy the essence of friendship
by running into either extreme.” What! impos∣sible
that a city can contain a hundred thousand in∣habitants!
Had ARISTOTLE never seen nor heard
<PB N="263" REF="263"/>
of a city which was near so populous? This, I must
own, passes my comprehension.</P>
<P>PLINY<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 28.</NOTE> tells us that SELEUCIA, the seat of the
GREEK empire in the East, was reported to contain
600,000 people. CARTHAGE is said by STRABO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE> to
have contained 700,000. The inhabitants of PEKIN
are not much more numerous. LONDON, PARIS,
and CONSTANTINOPLE, may admit of nearly the
same computation; at least, the two latter cities do
not exceed it. ROME, ALEXANDRIA, ANTIOCH,
we have already spoke of. From the experience of
past and present ages, one might conjecture, that
there is a kind of impossibility, that any city could
ever rise much beyond this proportion. Whether the
grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on
empire, there seem to be invincible obstacles, which
prevent its farther progress. The seats of vast mo∣narchies,
by introducing extravagant luxury, irre∣gular
expence, idleness, dependence, and false ideas
of rank and superiority, are improper for commerce.
Extensive commerce checks itself, by raising the price
of all labour and commodities. When a great court
engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, pos∣sessed
of overgrown fortunes, the middling gentry re∣main
in their provincial towns, where they can make a
figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions
of a state arrive at an enormous size, there necessarily
<PB N="264" REF="264"/>
arise many capitals, in the remoter provinces, whither
all the inhabitants, except a few courtiers, repair, for
education, fortune, and amusement<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Such were ALEXANDRIA, ANTIOCH, CARTHAGE, EPHESUS, LYONS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the ROMAN empire. Such are even BOURDEAUX, THOLOUSE, DIJON, RENNES, ROUEN, AIX, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in FRANCE; DUBLIN, EDINBURGH, YORK, in the BRITISH dominions.</NOTE>. LONDON, by
uniting extensive commerce and middling empire,
has, perhaps, arrived at a greatness, which no city
will ever be able to exceed.</P>
<P>CHUSE DOVER or CALAIS for a center: Draw a
circle of two hundred miles radius: You comprehend
LONDON, PARIS, the NETHERLANDS, the UNITED
PROVINCES, and some of the best cultivated counties
of FRANCE and ENGLAND. It may safely, I think,
be affirmed that no spot of ground can be found, in
antiquity, of equal extent, which contained near so
many great and populous cities, and was so stocked
with riches and inhabitants. To balance, in both
periods, the states, which possessed most art, know∣ledge,
civility, and the best police, seems the truest
method of comparison.</P>
<P>'Tis an observation of L'ABBE DU BOS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Vol. 2. §. 16.</NOTE>, that
ITALY is warmer at present than it was in antient
times. “The annals of ROME tell us,” says he,
<PB N="265" REF="265"/>
that in the year 480 <HI>ab U. C.</HI> the winter was so
severe that it destroyed the trees. The TYBER
froze in ROME, and the ground was covered with
snow for forty days. When JUVENAL<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sat. 6.</NOTE> describes
a superstitious woman, he represents her as break∣ing
the ice of the TYBER, that she might perform
her ablutions.
<Q><L>Hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem,</L>
<L>Ter matutino Tyberi mergetur.</L></Q>
He speaks of that river's freezing as a common
event. Many passages of HORACE suppose the
streets of ROME full of snow and ice. We should
have more certainty with regard to this point, had
the antients known the use of thermometers: But
their writers, without intending it, give us inform∣ation,
sufficient to convince us, that the winters are
now much more temperate at ROME than formerly.
At present, the TYBER no more freezes at ROME
than the NILE at CAIRO. The ROMANS esteem
the winter very rigorous, if the snow lies two days,
and if one sees for eight and forty hours a few ici∣cles
hang from a fountain that has a north expo∣sition.”</P>
<P>THE observation of this ingenious critic may be
extended to other EUROPEAN climates. Who could
<PB N="266" REF="266"/>
discover the mild climate of FRANCE in DIODORUS
SICULUS's<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE> description of that of GAUL? “As it is
a northern climate,” says he, “it is infested with
cold to an extreme degree. In cloudy weather, in∣stead
of rain, there fall great snows; and in clear
weather it there freezes so excessive hard, that the
rivers acquire bridges of their own substance, over
which, not only single travellers may pass, but
large armies, accompanied with all their baggage
and loaded waggons. And there being many
rivers in GAUL, the RHONE, the RHINE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> al∣most
all of them are froze over; and 'tis usual, in
order to prevent falling, to cover the ice with chaff
and straw at the places where the road passes.”
<HI>Colder than a</HI> GALLIC <HI>Winter,</HI> is used by PETRO∣NIUS,
as a proverbial expression.</P>
<P>NORTH of the CEVENNES, says STRABO<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE>. GAUL
produces not figs and olives: And the vines, which
have been planted, bear not grapes, that will ripen.</P>
<P>OVID positively maintains, with all the serious af∣firmation
of prose, that the EUXINE sea was frozen
over every winter in his time; and he appeals to RO∣MAN
governours, whom he names, for the truth of
his assertion<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Trist.</HI> lib. 3. eleg. 9. <HI>De Ponto,</HI> lib. 4. eleg. 7, 9, 10.</NOTE>. This seldom or never happens at pre∣sent
<PB N="267" REF="267"/>
in the latitude of TOMI, whither OVID was ba∣nished.
All the complaints of the same poet seem to
mark a rigour of the seasons, which is scarce experi∣enced
at present in PETERSBURG or STOCKHOLM.</P>
<P>TOURNEFORT, a <HI>Provencal,</HI> who had travelled in∣to
the same countries, observes, that there is not a
finer climate in the world: And he asserts, that no∣thing
but OVID'S melancholy could have given him
such dismal ideas of it. But the facts mentioned by
that poet, are too circumstantial to bear any such in∣terpretation.</P>
<P>POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4. cap. 21.</NOTE> says, that the climate in ARCADIA
was very cold, and the air moist.</P>
<P>“ITALY,” says VARRO<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>, “is the most tempe∣rate
climate in EUROPE. The inland parts” (GAUL,
GERMANY, and PANNONIA, no doubt) “have al∣most
perpetual winter.”</P>
<P>THE northern parts of SPAIN, according to STRA∣BO
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3.</NOTE>, are but ill inhabited, because of the great cold.</P>
<P>ALLOWING, therefore, this remark to be just,
that EUROPE is become warmer than formerly; how
can we account for it? Plainly, by no other method,
but by supposing, that the land is at present much
better cultivated, and that the woods are cleared,
<PB N="268" REF="268"/>
which formerly threw a shade upon the earth, and
kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to it. Our
northern colonies in AMERICA become more tempe∣rate,
in proportion as the woods are felled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The warm southern colonies also become more healthful: And 'tis remarkable, that in the SPANISH histories of the first discovery and conquest of these countries, they appear to have been very healthful; being then well peopled and cultivated. No account of the sickness or decay of CORTES's or PIZZAR∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>O's small armies.</NOTE>; but in
general, every one may remark, that cold still makes
itself much more severely felt, both in North and
South AMERICA, than in places under the same lati∣tude
in EUROPE.</P>
<P>SASERNA, quoted by COLUMELLA<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 1.</NOTE>, affirmed,
that the disposition of the heavens was altered before
his time, and that the air had become much milder
and warmer; as appears hence, says he, that many
places now abound with vineyards and olive-planta∣tions,
which formerly, by reason of the rigour of the
climate, could raise none of these productions. Such
a change, if real, will be allowed an evident sign of
the better cultivation and peopling of countries be∣fore
the age of SASERNA<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He seems to have lived about the time of the younger AFRICANUS; lib 1. cap. 1.</NOTE>; and, if it be continued to
<PB N="269" REF="269"/>
the present times, is a proof, that these advantages
have been continually increasing thro'out this part of
the world.</P>
<P>LET us now cast our eye over all the countries
which were the scene of antient and modern history,
and compare their past and present situation. We
shall not, perhaps, find such foundation for the com∣plaint
of the present emptiness and desolation of the
world. AEGYPT is represented by MAILLET, to
whom we owe the best account of it, as extremely
populous; tho' he esteems the number of its inhabit∣ants
to be diminished. SYRIA, and the Lesser ASIA,
as well as the coast of BARBARY, I can readily own,
to be very desart in comparison of their antient con∣dition.
The depopulation of GREECE is also very
obvious. But whether the country now called TUR∣KY
in EUROPE may not, in general, contain as many
inhabitants as during the flourishing period of GREECE,
may be a little doubtful. The THRACIANS seem
then to have lived like the TARTARS at present, by
pasturage and plunder<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Xenopb. exp.</HI> lib. 7. <HI>Polyb.</HI> lib. 4. cap. 45.</NOTE>: The GETES were still more
uncivilized<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ovid passim, &amp;c. Strabo,</HI> lib. 7.</NOTE>: And the ILLYRIANS were no bet∣ter
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Polyb.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 12.</NOTE>. These occupy nine tenths of that country:
<PB N="270" REF="270"/>
And tho' the government of the TURKS be not very
favourable to industry and propagation; yet it pre∣serves
at least peace and order among the inhabitants;
and is preferable to that barbarous, unsettled condi∣tion,
in which they antiently lived.</P>
<P>POLAND and MUSCOVY in EUROPE are not po∣pulous;
but are certainly much more so than the an∣tient
SARMATIA and SCYTHIA; where no husbandry
or agriculture was ever heard of, and pasturage was
the sole art by which the people were maintained.
The like observation may be extended to DENMARK
and SWEDEN. No one ought to esteem the immense
swarms of people, which formerly came from the
North, and over ran all EUROPE, to be any objection
to this opinion. Where a whole nation, or even half
of it remove their seat; 'tis easy to imagine, what a
prodigious multitude they must form; with what des∣perate
valour they must make their attacks; and how
the terror they strike into the invaded nations will
make these magnify, in their imagination, both the
courage and multitude of the invaders. SCOTLAND
is neither extensive nor populous; but were the half
of its inhabitants to seek new seats, they would form
a colony as large as the TEUTONS and CIMBRI;
and would shake all EUROPE, supposing it in no better
condition for defence than formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="271"/>
GERMANY has surely at present twenty times more
inhabitants than in antient times, when they culti∣vated
no ground, and each tribe valued itself on the
extensive desolation which it spread around; as we
learn from CAESAR<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>De bello Gallico,</HI> lib. 6.</NOTE>, and TACITUS<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>De moribus Germ.</HI></NOTE>, and STRA∣BO
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>. A proof, that the division into small repub∣lics
will not alone render a nation populous, unless
attended with the spirit of peace, order, and industry.</P>
<P>THE barbarous condition of BRITAIN in former
times is well known, and the thinness of its inhabit∣ants
may easily be conjectured, both from their bar∣barity,
and from a circumstance mentioned by HERO∣DIAN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3. cap. 47.</NOTE>, that all BRITAIN was marshy, even in SE∣VERUS's
time, after the ROMANS had been fully
settled in it above a whole century.</P>
<P>'Tis not easily imagined, that the GAULS were
antiently much more advanced in the arts of life
than their northern neighbours; since they travelled
to this island for their education in the mysteries of
the religion and philosophy of the DRUIDS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">CAESAR <HI>de bello Gallico;</HI> lib. 16. STRABO, lib. 7. says, the GAULS were not much more improved than the GERMANS.</NOTE>. I
<PB N="272" REF="272"/>
cannot, therefore, think, that GAUL was then near
so populous as FRANCE is at present.</P>
<P>WERE we to believe, indeed, and join together
the testimony of APPIAN, and that of DIODORUS
SICULUS, we must admit an incredible populousness
in GAUL. The former historian<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Celt. pars 1.</NOTE> says, that there
were 400 nations in that country; the latter<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5.</NOTE> af∣firms,
that the largest of the GALLIC nations consist∣ed
of 200,000 men, besides women and children, and
the least of 50,000. Calculating, therefore, at a
medium, we must admit of near 200 millions of peo∣ple,
in a country, which we esteem populous at pre∣sent,
tho' supposed to co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tain little more than
twenty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Antient GAUL was more extensive than modern FRANCE.</NOTE>. Such calculations, therefore, by their ex∣travagance
lose all manner of authority. We may
observe, that that equality of property, to which the
populousness of antiquity may be ascribed, had no
place among the GAULS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Caesar de bello Gallico;</HI> lib. 6.</NOTE>. Their intestine wars al∣so,
before CAESAR's time, were almost perpetual<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Id. ibid.</HI></NOTE>.
And STRAEO<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE> observes, that tho' all GAUL was
cultivated, yet it was not cultivated with any skill or
care; the genius of the inhabitants leading them less
to arts than arms, till their slavery to ROME produced
peace among themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="273"/>
CAESAR<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>De bello Gallico;</HI> lib. 2.</NOTE> enumerates very particularly the great
forces which were levied in BELGIUM to oppose his
conquests; and makes them amount to 208,000.
These were not the whole people able to bear arms
in BELGIUM: For the same historian tells us, that
the BELLOVACI could have brought a hundred thou∣sand
men into the field, tho' they engaged only for
sixty. Taking the whole, therefore, in this propor∣tion
of ten to six, the sum of fighting men in all the
states of BELGIUM was about 350,000; the whole
inhabitants a million and a half. And BELGIUM
being about the fourt of GAUL, that country might
contain six millions, which is not the third of its pre∣sent
inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from CAESAR's account, that the GAULS had no domestic slaves, who formed a different order from the <HI>Ple∣bes.</HI> The whole common people were indeed a kind of slaves to the nobility, as the people of POLAND are at this day: And a nobleman of GAUL had sometimes ten thousand dependants of this kind. Nor can we doubt, that the armies were composed of the people as well as of the nobility: An army of 100,000 noblemen from a very small state is incredible. The fighting men amongst the HELVETI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were the fourth part of the whole inhabitants; a clear proof that all the males of military age bore arms. See CAESAR <HI>de bello Gall.</HI> lib. 1.</P>
<P>We may remark, that the numbers in CAESAR's commen∣taries can be more depended on than those of any other antient author, because of the GREEK translation, which still remains, and which checks the LATIN original.</P></NOTE>. We are informed by CAESAR,
<PB N="274" REF="274"/>
that the GAULS had no fixed property in land; but
that the chieftains, when any death happened in a
family, made a new division of all the lands among
the several members of the family. This is the cus∣tom
of <HI>Tanistry,</HI> which so long prevailed in IRE∣LAND;
and which retained that country in a state of
misery, barbarism, and desolation.</P>
<P>THE antient HELVETIA was 250 miles in length,
and 180 in breadth, according to the same author<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>De bello Gallico;</HI> lib. 1.</NOTE>;
yet contained only 360,000 inhabitants. The can∣ton
of BERNE alone has, at present, as many
people.</P>
<P>AFTER this computation of APPIAN and DIO∣DORUS
SICULUS, I know not, whether I dare af∣firm,
that the modern DUTCH are more numerous
than the antient BATAVI.</P>
<P>SPAIN is decayed from what it was three centuries
ago; but if we step backward two thousand years, and
consider the restless, turbulent, unsettled condition of
its inhabitants, we may probably be inclined to think,
that it is now much more populous. Many SPA∣NIARDS
killed themselves when deprived of their
arms by the ROMANS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Titi Livii;</HI> lib. 34. cap. 17.</NOTE>. It appears from PLU∣TARCH<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In vita Marii.</NOTE>,
<PB N="275" REF="275"/>
that robbery and plunder were esteemed
honourable among the SPANIARDS. HIRTI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>De bello Hisp.</HI></NOTE> re∣presents
in the same light the situation of that country
in CAESAR's time; and he says, that every man was
obliged to live in castles and walled towns for his se∣curity.
It was not till its final conquest under AU∣GUSTUS,
that these disorders were repressed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vell. Paterc.</HI> lib. 2. § 90.</NOTE>. The
account which STRABO<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 3.</NOTE> and JUSTIN<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 44.</NOTE> give of
SPAIN, corresponds exactly with those above men∣tioned.
How much, therefore, must it diminish from
our idea of the populousness of antiquity, when we
find, that CICERO, comparing ITALY, AFRIC, GAUL,
GREECE, and SPAIN, mentions the great number of
inhabitants, as the peculiar circumstance which ren∣dered
this latter country formidable<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">“Nec numero Hispanos, nec robore Gallos, nec calliditate Poenos, nec artibus graecos, nec denique hoc ipso hujus gen∣tis, ac terrae domestico nativoque sensu, Italos ipfos ac Lati∣nos—superavimus.” <HI>De har<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sp. resp.</HI> cap. 9.

<P>ITALY, 'tis probable however, has decayed: But
how many great cities does it still contain? VENICE,
GENOA, PAVIA, TURIN, MILAN, NAPLES, FLO∣RENCE,
<PB N="276" REF="276"/>
LEGHORN, which either subsisted not in an∣tient
times, or were then very inconsiderable? If we
reflect on this, we shall not be apt to carry matters to
so great an extreme as is usual, with regard to this
subject.</P>
<P>WHEN the ROMAN authors complain, that ITALY,
which formerly exported corn, became dependent
on all the provinces for its daily bread, they never as∣cribe
this alteration to the increase of its inhabitants,
but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">VARRO <HI>de re rustica,</HI> lib. 2. praef. COLUMELLA praef. SUETON. AUGUST. cap. 42.</NOTE>. A
natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing

WERE I to assign a period, when I imagine this
part of the world might possibly contain more inha∣bitants
than at present, I should pitch upon the age
of TRAJAN and the ANTONINES; the great extent
of the ROMAN empire being then civilized and culti∣vated,
settled almost in a profound peace both foreign
and domestic, and living under the same regular po∣lice
and government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The inhabitants of MARSEILLES lost not their superiority over the GAULS in commerce and the mechanic arts, till the ROMAN dominion turned the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life. See STRABO, Lib. 4. That author, in several places, repeats the observation concerning the improvement ari∣sing from the ROMAN arts and civility: And he lived at the time when the change was new, and would be more sensible. So also PLINY: “Quis enim non, communicato orbe ter∣rarum, majestate ROMANI imperii, profecisse vitam putet, commercio rerum ac societate festae pacis, omniaque etiam, quae occulta antea fuerant, in promiscuo usu facta. Lib. 14. pro∣oem. Numine deum electa (speaking of ITALY) quae coelum ipsum clarius faceret, sparsa congregaret imperia, ritusque molliret, &amp; tot populorum discordes, ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraheret ad colloquia, &amp; humanitatem homini daret; breviterque una cunctarum gentium in toto orbe patria fieret;” lib. 2. cap. 5. Nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from TERTULLIAN, who lived about the age of SEVERUS. “Certe quidem ipse orbis in promptu est, cultior de die &amp; instructior pristino. Omnia jam pervia, omnia nota, omnia negotiosa. Solitudines famosas re∣tro fundi amoenissimi obliteraverunt, silvas arva domuerunt, feras pecora fugaverunt; arenae seruntur, saxa panguntur, pa∣ludes eliquantur, tantae urbes, quantae non casae quon∣dam. Jam nec insulae horrent, nec scopuli terrent; ubique domus, ubique populos, ubique respublica, ubique vita. Summum testimonium frequentiae humanae, onerosi sumus mundo, vix nobis elementa sufficiunt; &amp; necessitates arctiores, &amp; querelae apud emnes, dum jam nos natura non suftinet.” De anima, cap. 30. The air of rhetoric and decla∣mation which appears in this passage, diminishes somewhat from its authority, but does not intirely destroy it. The same re∣mark may be extended to the following passage of ARISTIDES the sophist, who lived in the age of ADRIAN. “The whole world,” says he, addressing himself to the ROMANS, “seems to keep one holiday; and mankind, laying aside the swords which they formerly wore, now betake themselves to feasting and to joy. The cities, forgetting their antient contentions, preserve only one emulation, which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament? Theatres every where arise, am∣phitheatres, porticoes, aqueducts, temples, schools, academies; and one may safely pronounce, that the sinking world has been again raised by your auspicious empire. Nor have cities alone received an increase of ornament and beauty; but the whole earth, like a garden or paradise, is cultivated and adorned: Insomuch, that such of mankind as are placed out of the limits of your empire (who are but few) seem to merit our sympathy and compassion.”</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, that tho' DIODORUS SICULUS makes the whole inhabitants of AEGYPT, when conquered by the ROMANS, amount only to three millions; yet JOSEPH. <HI>de belle Jud.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 16. says, that its inhabitants, excluding those of ALEXAN∣DRIA, were seven millions and a half, in the reign of NERO: And he expressly says, that he drew this account from the books of the ROMAN publicans, who levied the poll-tax. STRABO, lib. 17. praises the superior police of the ROMANS with regard to the finances of AEGYPT, above that of its former monarchs: And no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people. Yet we read in ATHENAEUS, (lib. 1. cap. 25.) who flourished during the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign of the ANTONINES, that the town MAREIA, near ALEXANDRIA, which was formerly a large city, had dwindled into a village. This is not, properly speaking, a contradiction. SUIDAS (AUGUST.) says, that the Emperor AUGUSTUS, having numbered the whole ROMAN empire, found it contained only 4,101,017 men (<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.) There is here surely some great mistake, either in the author or trans∣criber. But this authority, feeble as it is, may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of HERODOTUS and DIODORUS SICULUS with regard to more early times.</P></NOTE>. But we are told, that all ex∣tensive
<PB N="278" REF="278"/>
governments, especially absolute monarchies,
are destructive to population, and contain a secret vice
<PB N="279" REF="279"/>
and poison, which destroy the effect of all these promi∣sing
appearances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>L'Esprit desloix,</HI> liv. 23. chap. 19.</NOTE>. To confirm this, there is a pas∣sage
cited from PLUTARCH<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>De orac. defectus.</HI></NOTE>, which being somewhat
singular, we shall here examine it.</P>
<P>THAT author, endeavouring to account for the
silence of many of the oracles, says, that it may be
<PB N="280" REF="280"/>
ascribed to the present desolation of the world, pro∣ceeding
from former wars and factions; which com∣mon
calamity, he adds, has fallen heavier upon
GREECE than on any other country; insomuch, that
the whole could scarce at present furnish three thou∣sand
warriors; a number which, in the time of the
MEDIAN war, were supplied by the single city of
MEGARA. The gods, therefore, who affect works
of dignity and importance, have suppressed many of
their oracles, and deign not to use so many interpreters
of their will to so diminutive a people.</P>
<P>I MUST confess, that this passage contains so many
difficulties, that I know not what to make of it. You
may observe, that PLUTARCH assigns, for a cause of
the decay of mankind, not the extensive dominion of
the ROMANS, but the former wars and factions of
the several nations; all which were quieted by the
ROMAN arms. PLUTARCH's reasoning, therefore, is
directly contrary to the inference which is drawn
from the fact he advances.</P>
<P>POLYBIUS supposes, that GREECE had become
more prosperous and flourishing after the establish∣ment
of the ROMAN yoke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 62. It may perhaps be imagined, that POLY∣BIUS, being dependent on ROME, would naturally extol the ROMAN dominion. But, in the <HI>first</HI> place, POLYBIUS, tho' one sees sometimes instances of his caution, discovers no symptoms of flattery. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This opinion is only delivered in a single stroke, by the by, while he is intent upon another subject; and 'tis allowed, if there be any suspicion of an author's insincerity, that these oblique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions.</NOTE>; and tho' that historian
<PB N="281" REF="281"/>
wrote before these conquerors had degenerated, from
being the patrons, to be the plunderers of mankind;
yet as we find from TACITUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annal.</HI> lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>, that the severity of
the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the
governors, we have no reason to think that extensive
monarchy so destructive as it is often represented.</P>
<P>WE learn from STRABO<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 8. &amp; 9.</NOTE>, that the ROMANS, from
their regard to the GREEKS, maintained, to his time,
most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated
nation; and NERO afterwards rather increased
them<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH. <HI>De his qui sero a numine puniuntur.</HI></NOTE>. How therefore can we imagine, that the
ROMAN yoke was so burdensome over that part of the
world? The oppression of the proconsuls was check∣ed;
and the magistracies in GREECE being all be∣stowed,
in the several cities, by the free votes of the
people, there was no great necessity for the compe∣titors
to attend the emperor's court. If great num∣bers
went to seek their fortunes in ROME, and ad∣vance
<PB N="282" REF="282"/>
themselves by learning or eloquence, the com∣modities
of their native country, many of them would
return with the fortunes which they had acquired,
and thereby inrich the GRECIAN commonwealths.</P>
<P>BUT PLUTARCH says, that the general depopula∣tion
had been more sensibly felt in GREECE than in
any other country. How is this reconcileable to its
superior privileges and advantages?</P>
<P>BESIDES, this passage, by proving too much, really
proves nothing. <HI>Only three thousand men able to bear
arms in all</HI> GREECE! Who can admit so strange a
proposition, especially if we consider the great number
of GREEK cities, whose names still remain in history,
and which are mentioned by writers long after the
age of PLUTARCH? There are there surely ten times
more people at present, when there scarce remains a
city in all the bounds of ancient GREECE. That
country is still tolerably cultivated, and furnishes a
sure supply of corn, in case of any scarcity in SPAIN,
ITALY, or the south of FRANCE.</P>
<P>WE may observe, that the antient frugality of the
GREEKS, and their equality of property, still subsisted
during the age of PLUTARCH; as appears from LU∣CIAN
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>De mercede condu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tis.</HI></NOTE>. Nor is there any ground to imagine, that
<PB N="283" REF="283"/>
that country was possessed by a few masters, and a
great number of slaves.</P>
<P>'TIS probable, indeed, that military discipline, be∣ing
intirely useless, was extremely neglected in
GREECE after the establishment of the ROMAN em∣pire;
and if these commonwealths, formerly so war∣like
and ambitious, maintained each of them a small
city-guard, to prevent mobbish disorders, 'tis all they
had occasion for: And these, perhaps, did not amount
to 3000 men, thro'out all GREECE. I own, that if
PLUTARCH had this fact in his eye, he is here
guilty of a very gross paralogism, and assigns causes
no way proportioned to the effects. But is it so great
a prodigy, that an author should fall into a mistake
of this nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>I must confess, that that discourse of PLUTARCH, con∣cerning the silence of the oracles, is in general of so odd a tex∣ture, and so unlike his other productions, that one is at a loss what judgment to form of it. 'Tis wrote in dialogue, which is a method of composition that PLUTARCH commonly little af∣fects. The personages he introduces advance very wild, absurd, and contradictory opinions, more like the visionary systems or ravings of PLATO than the solid sense of PLUTARCH. There runs also thro' the whole an air of superstition and credulity, which resembles very little the spirit that appears in other phi∣losophical compositions of that author. For 'tis remarkable, that tho' PLUTARCH be an historian as superstitious as HERO∣DOTUS or LIVY, yet there is scarcely, in all antiquity, a philo∣sopher less superstitious, excepting CICERO and LUCIAN. I must therefore confess, that a passage of PLUTARCH, cited from this discourse, has much less authority with me, than if it had been found in most of his other compositions.</P>
<P>There is only one other discourse of PLUTARCH liable to like objections, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>concerning those whose punishment is delayed by the Deity.</HI> It is also wrote in dialogue, contains like super∣stitious, wild visions, and seems to have been chiefly composed in rivalship to PLATO, particularly his last book, <HI>de republica.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot but observe, that Mons FONTENELLE, a writer eminent for candor, seems to have departed a little from his usual character, when he endeavours to throw a ridicule up∣on PLUTARCH on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles. The absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascribed to PLU∣TARCH. He makes them refute each other; and, in general, he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions, which FONTENELLE would ridicule him for maintaining. See <HI>His∣toire des oracles.</HI></P></NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="284"/>
BUT whatever force may remain in this passage of
PLUTARCH, we shall endeavour to counterbalance it
by as remarkable a passage in DIODORUS SI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ULUS,
where the historian, after mentioning NINUS's army
of 1,700,000 foot and 200,000 horse, endeavours to
support the credibility of this account by some pos∣terior
facts; and adds, that we must not form a no∣tion
of the antient populousness of mankind from the
present emptiness and depopulation which is spread
<PB N="285" REF="285"/>
over the world<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE>. Thus an author, who lived at that
very period of antiquity which is represented as most
populous<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">He was cotemporary with CAESAR and AUGUSTUS.</NOTE>, complains of the desolation which then
prevailed, gives the preference to former times, and
has recourse to antient fables as a foundation for his
opinion. The humour of blaming the present, and
admiring the past, is strongly rooted in human na∣ture,
and has an influence even on persons endued
with the profoundest judgment and most extensive

<HEAD>ESSAY XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the ORIGINAL CONTRACT.</HEAD>
<P>AS no party, in the present age, can support itself,
without a philosophical or speculative system of
principles, annexed to its political or practical one;
we accordingly find, that each of the parties, into
which this nation is divided, has reared up a fabric of
the former kind, in order to protect and cover that
scheme of actions, which it pursues. The people be∣ing
commonly very rude builders, especially in this
speculative way, and more especially still, when actu∣ated
by party zeal; 'tis natural to imagine, that their
workmanship must be a little unshapely, and discover
evident marks of that violence and hurry, in which it
was raised. The one party, by tracing up the ori∣gin
of government to the DEITY, endeavour to ren∣der
government so sacred and inviolate, that it must
be little less than sacrilege, however disorderly it may
become, to touch or invade it, in the smallest article.
The other party, by founding government altogether
<PB N="288" REF="287"/>
on the consent of the PEOPLE, suppose that there is
a kind of <HI>original contract,</HI> by which the subjects have
reserved the power of resisting their sovereign, when∣ever
they find themselves aggrieved by that authority,
with which they have, for certain purposes, volunta∣rily
entrusted him. These are the speculative prin∣ciples
of the two parties; and these too are the prac∣tical
consequences deduced from them.</P>
<P><HI>I SHALL venture to affirm,</HI> That both these <HI>systems</HI>
of speculative principles are just; tho' not in the sense,
intended by the parties: <HI>And</HI> That both the <HI>schemes</HI> of
practical consequences are prudent; tho' not in the ex∣tremes,
to which each party, in opposition to the other,
has commonly endeavoured to carry them.</P>
<P>THAT the DEITY is the ultimate author of all go∣vernment,
will never be denied by any one who ad∣mits
a general providence, and allows, that all events
in the universe are conducted by an uniform plan and
directed to wise purposes. As 'tis impossible for hu∣man
race to subsist, at least in any comfortable or se∣cure
state, without the protection of government; go∣vernment
must certainly have been intended by that
beneficent Being, who means the good of all his crea∣tures:
And as it has universally, in fact, taken place,
in all countries, and all ages; we may conclude, with
still greater certainty, that it was intended by that
<PB N="289" REF="288"/>
omniscient Being, who can never be deceived by any
event or operation. But since he gave rise to it, not
by any particular or miraculous interposition, but by
his concealed and universal efficacy; a sovereign can∣not,
properly speaking, be called his vicegerent, in
any other sense than every power or force, being de∣rived
from him, may be said to act by his commission.
Whatever actually happens is comprehended in the
general plan or intention of providence; nor has the
greatest and most lawful prince any more reason, up∣on
that account, to plead a peculiar sacredness or in∣violable
authority, than an inferior magistrate, or even
an usurper, or even a robber and a pyrate. The same
divine super-intendant, who, for wise purposes, in∣vested
an ELIZABETH or a HENRY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENRY the 4th of FRANCE.</NOTE> with authority,
did also, for purposes, no doubt, equally wise, tho'
unknown, bestow power on a BORGIA or an ANGRIA.
The same causes, which gave rise to the sovereign
power in every state, established likewise every petty
jurisdiction in it, and every limited Authority. A
constable therefore, no less than a king, acts by a
divine commission, and possesses an indeseasible right.</P>
<P>WHEN we consider how nearly equal all men are
in their bodily force, and even in their mental pow∣ers
and faculties, till cultivated by education; we must
necessarily allow, that nothing but their own consent
<PB N="290" REF="289"/>
could, at first, associate them together, and subject
them to any authority. The people, if we trace up
government to its first origin in the woods and deserts,
are the source of all power and jurisdiction, and vo∣luntarily,
for the sake of peace and order, abandoned
their native liberty, and received laws from their equal
and companion. The conditions, upon which they
were willing to submit, were either exprest, or were
so clear and obvious, that it might well be esteemed
superfluous to express them. If this, then, be meant
by the <HI>original contract,</HI> it cannot be denied, that all
government is, at first, founded on a contract, and
that the most ancient rude combinations of mankind
were formed entirely by that principle. In vain, are
we sent to the records to seek for this charter of our
liberties. It was not wrote on parchment, nor yet on
leaves or barks of trees. It preceded the use of writ∣ing
and all the other civilized arts of life. But we
trace it plainly in the nature of man, and in the equa∣lity,
which we find in all the individuals of that spe∣cies.
The force, which now prevails, and which is
founded on fleets and armies, is plainly political, and
derived from authority, the effect of established go∣vernment.
A man's natural force consists only in the
vigour of his limbs, and the firmness of his courage;
which could never subject multitudes to the command
of one. Nothing but their own consent, and their
sense of the advantages of peace and order, could have
had that influence.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="290"/>
BUT philosophers, who have embraced a party (if
that be not a contradiction in terms) are not con∣tented
with these concessions. They assert, not only
that government in its earliest infancy arose from con∣sent,
or the voluntary combination of the people; but
also, that, even at present, when it has attained its
full maturity, it rests on no other foundation. They
affirm, that all men are still born equal, and owe al∣legiance
to no prince or government, unless bound by
the obligation and sanction of a <HI>promise.</HI> And as no
man, without some equivalent, would forego the ad∣vantages
of his native liberty, and subject himself to
the will of another; this promise is always understood
to be conditional, and imposes on him no obligation,
unless he meets with justice and protection from his
sovereign. These advantages the sovereign promises
him in return; and if he fails in the execution, he has
broke, on his side, the articles of engagement, and
has thereby freed his subjects from all obligations to
allegiance Such, according to these philosophers, is
the foundation of authority in every government; and
such the right of resistance, possest by every subject.</P>
<P>BUT would these reasoners look abroad into the
world, they would meet with nothing that, in the
least, corresponds to their ideas, or can warrant so re∣fined
and philosophical a sysem. On the contrary,
we find, every where, princes, who claim their sub∣jects
<PB N="292" REF="291"/>
as their property, and assert their independent
right of sovereignty, from conquest or succession. We
find also, every where, subjects, who acknowledge
this right in their princes, and suppose themselves born
under obligations of obedience to a certain sovereign,
as much as under the ties of reverence and duty to
certain parents. These connexions are always con∣ceived
to be equally independent of our consent, in
PERSIA and CHINA; in FRANCE and SPAIN; and
even in HOLLAND and ENGLAND, wherever the doc∣trines
abovementioned have not been carefully incul∣cated.
Obedience or subjection becomes so familiar,
that most men never make any enquiry about its ori∣gin
or cause, more than about the principle of gravity,
resistance, or the most universal laws of nature. Or
if curiosity ever move them; so soon as they learn,
that they themselves and their ancestors have, for se∣veral
ages, or from time immemorial, been subject to
such a government or such a family; they immedi∣ately
acquiesce, and acknowledge their obligation to
allegiance. Were you to preach, in most parts of the
world, that political connexions are founded altoge∣ther
on voluntary consent or a mutual promise, the ma∣gistrate
would soon imprison you, as seditious, for
loosening the tyes of obedience; if your friends did
not before shut you up, as delirious, for advance∣ing
such absurdities. 'Tis strange, that an act of the
mind, which every individual is supposed to have
formed, and after he came to the use of reason too,
<PB N="293" REF="292"/>
otherwise it could have no authority; that this act, I
say, should be so unknown to all of them, that over
the face of the whole earth there scarce remain any
traces or memory of it.</P>
<P>BUT the contract, on which government is founded,
is said to be the <HI>original contract;</HI> and consequently
may be supposed too old to fall under the knowledge
of the present generation. If the agreement, by
which savage men first associated and conjoined their
force, be here meant, this is acknowledged to be real;
but being so antient, and being obliterated by a thou∣sand
changes of government and princes, it cannot
now be supposed to retain any authority. If we would
say any thing to the purpose, we must assert, that
every particular government, which is lawful, and
which imposes any duty of allegiance on the subject,
was, at first, founded on consent and a voluntary com∣pact.
But besides that this supposes the consent of
the fathers to bind the children, even to the most re∣more
generations (which republican writers will never
allow) besides this, I say, it is not justified by history
or experience, in any age or country of the world.</P>
<P>ALMOST all the governments, which exist at pre∣sent,
or of which there remains any record in story,
have been founded originally, either on usurpation or
conquest, or both, without any pretence of a fair con∣sent,
or voluntary subjection of the people. When
<PB N="294" REF="293"/>
an artful and bold man is placed at the head of an
army or faction, 'tis often easy for him, by employing
sometimes violence, sometimes false pretences, to esta∣blish
his dominion over a people a hundred times more
numerous than his partizans. He allows no such open
communication, that his enemies can know, with cer∣tainty,
their number of force. He gives them no
leisure to assemble together in a body to oppose him.
Even all those, who are the instruments of his usurpa∣tion,
may with his fall; but their ignorance of each
other's intention keeps them in awe, and is the sole
cause of his security. By such arts as these many go∣vernments
have been established; and this is all the
<HI>original contract,</HI> which they have to boast of.</P>
<P>THE face of the earth is continually changing, by
the encrease of small kingdoms into great empires,
by the dissolution of great empires into smaller king∣doms,
by the planting of colonies, by the migration
of tribes. Is there any thing discoverable in all these
events, but force and violence? Where is the mu∣tual
agreement or voluntary association so much talked
of?</P>
<P>EVEN the smoothest way, by which a nation may
receive a foreign master, by marriage or a will, is not
extremely honourable for the people; but supposes
<PB N="295" REF="294"/>
them to be disposed of, like a dowry or a legacy,
according to the pleasure or interest of their rulers.</P>
<P>BUT where no force interposes, and election takes
place; what is this election so highly vaunted? 'Tis
either the combination of a few great men, who de∣cide
for the whole, and will allow of no opposition:
Or 'tis the fury of a rabble, that follow a seditious
ringleader, who is not known, perhaps, to a dozen
among them, and who owes his advancement merely
to his own impudence, or to the momentary caprice
of his fellows.</P>
<P>ARE these disorderly elections, which are rare too,
of such mighty authority, as to be the only lawful
foundation of all government and allegiance?</P>
<P>IN reality, there is not a more terrible event, than
a total dissolution of government, which gives liberty
to the multitude, and makes the determination or
choice of the new establishment depend upon a number
which nearly approaches the body of the people: For
it never comes entirely to the whole body of them.
Every wise man, then, wishes to see, at the head of
a powerful and obedient army, a general, who may
speedily seize the prize, and give to the people a
master, which they are so unfit to choose for them∣selves.
So little correspondent is fact and reality to
those philosophical notions.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="295"/>
LET not the establishment at the <HI>revolution,</HI> deceive
us, or make us so much in love with a philosophical
origin to government, as to imagine all others mon∣strous
and irregular. Even that event was far from
corresponding to these refined ideas. It was only the
succession, and that only in the regal part of the go∣vernment,
which was then changed: And it was only
the majority of seven hundred, who determined that
change for near ten millions. I doubt not, indeed,
but the bulk, of these ten millions acquiesced wil∣lingly
in the determination: But was the matter left,
in the least, to their choice? Was it not justly sup∣posed
to be, from that moment, decided, and every
man punished, who refused to submit to the new so∣vereign?
How otherways could the matter have ever
been brought to any issue or conclusion?</P>
<P>THE republic of ATHENS was, I believe, the most
extensive democracy, which we read of in history:
Yet if we make the requisite allowances for the wo∣men,
the slaves, and the strangers, we shall find, that
that establishment was not, at first, made, nor any
law ever voted, by a tenth part of those, who are
bound to pay obedience to it. Not to mention the
islands and foreign dominions, which the ATHENIANS
claimed as theirs by right of conquest. And as 'tis
well known, that popular assemblies in that city were
always full of licence and disorder, notwithstanding
the forms and laws by which they were checked:
<PB N="297" REF="296"/>
How much more disorderly must they be, where they
form not the established constitution, but assemble tu∣multuously
on the dissolution of the antient govern∣ment,
in order to give rise to a new one? How chi∣merical
must it be to talk of a choice in any such cir∣cumstances?</P>
<P>THE ACHAEANS enjoyed the freest and most perfect
democracy of all antiquity; yet they employed force
to oblige some cities to enter into their league, as
we learn from POLYBIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 38.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>'TIS in vain to say, that all governments are, or
should be, at first, founded on popular consent, as
much as the necessity of human affairs will admit.
This favours entirely my pretension. I maintain,
that human affairs never will admit of this consent;
seldom of the appearance of it: But that conquest or
usurpation, that is, in plain terms, force, by dissolv∣ing
the antient governments, is the origin of almost
all the new ones, which ever were established in the
<PB N="298" REF="297"/>
world. And that in the few cases, where consent may
seem to have taken place, it was commonly so irre∣gular,
so confined, or so much intermixed either
with fraud or violence, that it cannot have any great
authority.</P>
<P>MY intention here is not to exclude the consent of
the people from being one just foundation of govern∣ment
where it has place. It is surely the best and
most sacred of any. I only pretend, that it has very
seldom had place in any degree, and never almost in
its full extent. And that therefore some other foun∣dation
of government must also be admitted.</P>
<P>WERE all men possest of so inflexible a regard to
justice, that, of themselves, they would totally abstain
from the properties of others; they had for ever re∣mained
in a state of absolute liberty, without subjec∣tion
to any magistrates or political society: But this is
a state of perfection, of which human nature is justly
esteemed incapable. Again; were all men possest of
so perfect an understanding, as always to know their
own interest, no form of government had ever been
submitted to, but what was established on consent,
and was fully canvast by each member of the society:
But this state of perfection is likewise much superior
to human nature. Reason, history and experience
show us, that all political societies have had an origin
much less accurate and regular; and were one to choose
<PB N="299" REF="298"/>
a period of time, when the people's consent was least
regarded in public transfactions, it would be precisely
on the establishment of a new government. In a
settled constitution, their inclinations are often studied;
but during the fury of revolutions, conquests, and
public convulsions, military force or political craft
usually decides the controversy.</P>
<P>WHEN a new government is established, by what∣ever
means, the people are commonly dissatisfied with
it, and pay obedience more from fear and necessity,
than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obliga∣tion.
The prince is watchful and jealous, and must
carefully guard against every beginning or appear∣ance
of insurrection. Time, by degrees, removes all
these difficulties, and accustoms the nation to regard,
as their lawful or native princes, that family, whom,
at first, they considered as usurpers or foreign conque∣rors.
In order to found this opinion, they have no
recourse to any notion of voluntary consent or pro∣mise,
which, they know, never was, in this case,
either expected or demanded. The original establish∣ment
was formed by violence, and submitted to from
necessity. The subsequent administration is also sup∣ported
by power, and acquiesced in by the people,
not as a matter of choice, but of obligation. They
imagine not, that their consent gives their prince a
title: But they willingly consent, because they think,
<PB N="300" REF="299"/>
that, from long possession, he has acquired a title in∣dependent
of their choice or inclination.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be said, that by living under the domi∣nion
of a prince, which one might leave, every indi∣vidual
has given a <HI>tacit</HI> consent to his authority, and
promised him obedience; it may be answered, That
such implied consent can only take place, where a
man imagines, that the matter depends on his choice.
But where he thinks (as all mankind do who are born
under established governments) that by his birth he
owes allegiance to a certain prince or certain govern∣ment;
it would be absurd to infer a consent or choice,
which he expresly, in this case, renounces and ab∣jures.</P>
<P>CAN
we seriously say, that a poor peasant or arti∣zan
has a free choice to leave his own country, when
he knows no foreign language or manners, and lives
from day to day, by the small wages which he ac∣quires?
We may as well assert, that a man, by re∣maining
in a vessel, freely consents to the dominion
of the master; tho' he was carried on board while
asleep, and must leap into the ocean, and perish, the
moment he leaves her.</P>
<P>WHAT if the prince forbid his subjects to quit his
dominions; as in TIBERIUS's time, it was regarded
as a crime in a ROMAN knight that he had attempted
to fly to the PARTHIANS, in order to escape the ty∣ranny
<PB N="301" REF="300"/>
of that emperor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TACIT. Ann. 6. cap. 14.</NOTE>? Or as the antient MUSCO∣VITES
prohibited all travelling under pain of death?
And did a prince observe, that many of his subjects
were seized with the frenzy of transporting themselves
to foreign nations, he would doubtless, with great
reason and justice, restrain them, in order to prevent
the depopulation of his own country. Would he for∣feit
the allegiance of all his subjects, by so wise and
reasonable a law? Yet the freedom of their choice
is surely, in that case, ravished from them.</P>
<P>A COMPANY of men, who should leave their na∣tive
country, in order to people some uninhabited re∣gion,
might dream of recovering their native free∣dom;
but they would soon find, that their prince
still laid claim to them, and called them his subjects,
even in their new settlement. And in this he would
but act conformably to the common ideas of mankind.</P>
<P>THE truest <HI>tacit</HI> consent of this kind, which is ever
observed, is when a foreigner settles in any country,
and is beforehand acquainted with the prince, and
government, and laws, to which he must submit:
Yet is his allegiance, tho' more voluntary, much less
expected or depended on, than that of a natural born
subject. On the contrary, his native prince still asserts
a claim to him. And if he punishes not the renegade,
<PB N="302" REF="301"/>
when he seizes him in war with his new prince's com∣mission;
this clemency is not founded on the muni∣cipal
law, which in all countries condemns the pri∣soner;
but on the consent of princes, who have
agreed to this indulgence, in order to prevent re∣prisals.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE an usurper, after having banished his law∣ful
prince and royal family, should establish his domi∣nion
for ten or a dozen years in any country, and
should preserve such exact discipline in his troops, and
so regular a disposition in his garrisons, that no insur∣rection
had ever been raised, or even murmur heard,
against his administration: Can it be asserted, that the
people, who in their hearts abhor his treason, have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> consented to his authority, and promised him
allegiance, merely because, from necessity, they live
under his dominion? Suppose again their natural
prince restored, by means of an army, which he as∣sembles
in foreign countries: They receive him with
joy and ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ltation, and shew plainly with what reluc∣tance
they had submitted to any other yoke. I may
now ask, upon what foundation the prince's title-stands?
Not on popular consent surely: For tho' the
people willingly acquiesce in his authority, they never
imagine, that their consent makes him sovereign.
They consent; because they apprehend him to be al∣ready,
by birth, their lawful sovereign. And as to
<PB N="303" REF="302"/>
that tacit consent, which may now be inferred from
their living under his dominion, this is no more than
what they formerly gave to the tyrant and usurper.</P>
<P>WHEN we assert, that all lawful government arises
from the people, we certainly do them a great deal
more honour than they deserve, or even expect and
desire from us. After the ROMAN dominions became
too unwieldy for the republic to govern, the people,
over the whole known world, were extremely grate∣ful
to AUGUSTUS for that authority, which, by vio∣lence,
he established over them; and they shewed an
equal disposition to submit to the successor, whom he
left them, by his last will and testament. It was af∣terwards
their misfortune, that there never was, in
one family, any long regular succession; but that their
line of princes was continually broke, either by pri∣vate
assassinations or public rebellions. The <HI>praeto∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an</HI>
bands, on the failure of every family, set up
one emperor; the legions in the East a second; those
in GERMANY, perhaps, a third: And the sword alone
could decide the controversy. The condition of the
people, in that mighty monarchy, was to be lamented,
not because the choice of the emperor was never left
to them; for that was impracticable: But because they
never fell under any succession of masters, who might
regularly follow each other. As to the violence and
wars and bloodshed, occasioned by every new settle∣ment;

<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/>
<PB N="304" REF="307"/>
those were not blameable, because they were
inevitable.</P>
<P>THE house of LANCASTER ruled in this island
about sixty years; yet the partizans of the white rose
seemed daily to multiply in ENGLAND. The present
establishment has taken place during a still longer pe∣riod.
Have all views of right in another family been
utterly extinguished; even tho' scarce any man now
alive had arrived at years of discretion, when it was
expelled, or could have consented to its dominion,
or have promised it allegiance? A sufficient indica∣tion
surely of the general sentiment of mankind on
this head. For we blame not the partizans of the
abdicated family, merely on account of the long time,
during which they have preserved their imaginary
fidelity. We blame them for adhering to a family,
which, we affirm, has been justly expelled, and which,
from the moment the new settlement took place, had
forfeited all title to authority.</P>
<P>BUT would we have a more regular, at least, a
more philosophical refutation of this principle of an
original contract or popular consent; perhaps, the fol∣lowing
observations may suffice.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>moral</HI> duties may be divided into two kinds.
The <HI>first</HI> are those, to which men are impelled by a
natural instinct or immediate propensity, which ope∣rates
<PB N="305" REF="308"/>
in them, independent of all ideas of obligation,
and of all views, either to public or private utility.
Of this nature are, love of children, gratitude to be∣nefactors,
pity to the unfortunate. When we reflect
on the advantage, which results to society from such
humane instincts, we pay them the just tribute of mo∣ral
approbation and esteem: But the person, actuated
by them, feels their power and influence, antecedent
to any such reflection.</P>
<P>THE <HI>second</HI> kind of moral duties are such as are
not supported by any original instinct of nature, but
are performed entirely from a sense of obligation,
when we consider the necessitie of human society,
and the impossibility of supporting it, if these duties
were neglected. 'Tis thus <HI>justice</HI> or a regard to the
property of others, <HI>fidelity</HI> or the observance of pro∣mises,
become obligatory, and acquire an authority
over mankind. For as 'tis evident, that every man
loves himself better than any other person, he is na∣turally
impelled to extend his acquisitions as much as
possible; and nothing can restrain him in this propen∣sity,
but reflection and experience, by which he learns
the pernicious effects of that licence, and the total dis∣solution
of society, which must ensue from it. His ori∣ginal
inclination, therefore, or instinct, is here checked
and restrained by a subsequent judgment or obser∣vation.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="309"/>
THE case is precisely the same with the political or
civil duty of <HI>allegiance,</HI> as with the natural duties of
justice and fidelity. Our primary instincts lead us, ei∣ther
to indulge ourselves in unlimited liberty, or to
seek dominion over others: And 'tis reflection only,
which engages us to sacrifice such strong passions to
the interests of peace and order. A very small de∣gree
of experience and observation suffices to teach us,
that society cannot possibly be maintained without
the authority of magistrates, and that this authority
must soon fall into contempt, where exact obedience
is not payed to it. The observation of these gene∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
and obvious interests is the source of all all<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣giance,
and of that moral obligation, which we at∣tribute
to it.</P>
<P>WHAT necessity, therefore, is there to found the
duty of <HI>allegiance</HI> or obedience to magistrates on that
of <HI>fidelity</HI> or a regard to promises, and to suppose,
that 'tis the consent of each individual, which subjects
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>im to government; when it appears, that both alle∣giance
and fidelity stand precisely on the same foun∣dation,
and are both submitted to by mankind, on
account of the apparent interests and neccssities of hu∣man
society? We are bound to obey our sovereign,
'tis said; because we have given a tacit promise to
that purpose. But why are we bound to observe our
promise? It must here be asserted, that the commerce
and intercourse of mankind, which are of such mighty
<PB N="307" REF="310"/>
advantage, can have no security where men pay no re∣gard
to their engagements. In like manner, may it
be said, that men could not live at all in society, at
least in a civilized society without laws and magistrates
and judges, to prevent the encroachments of the
strong upon the weak, of the violent upon the just
and equitable. The obligation to allegiance, being
of like force and authority with the obligation to
fidelity, we gain nothing by resolving the one into
the other. The general interests or necessities of so∣ciety
are sufficient to establish both.</P>
<P>IF the reason is asked of that obedience, which we
are bound to pay to government, I readily answer:
<HI>because soci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty could not otherwise sabsist:</HI> And this an∣swer
is clear and intelligible to all mankind. Your
answer is, <HI>because we should keep our word.</HI> But be∣sides,
that no body, till trained in a philosophical sys∣tem,
can either comprehend or relish this answer: Be∣sides
this, I say, you find yourself embarrassed, when
'tis asked, <HI>why we are bound to keep our word?</HI> And
you can give no other answer, but what would, im∣mediately,
without any circuit, have accounted for
our obligation to allegiance.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>to whom is allegiance due? And who are our
lawful sovereigns?</HI> This question is often the most
difficult of any, and liable to infinite discussions. When
people are so happy, that they can answer, <HI>Our pre∣sent
<PB N="308" REF="311"/>
sovereign, who inherits, in a direct, line, from an∣cesters,
that have governed us for many ages;</HI> this an∣swer
admits of no reply; even tho' historians, in trac∣ing
up to the remotest antiquity the origin of that
royal family, may find, as commonly happens, that
its first authority was derived from usurpation and vi∣olence.
'Tis confest, that private justice or the ab∣stinence
from the properties of others, is a most car∣dinal
virtue: Yet reason tells, that there is no pro∣perty
in durable objects, such as lands or houses, when
carefully examined in passing from hand to hand, but
must, in some period, have been founded on fraud
and injustice. The necessities of human society, nei∣ther
in private nor public life, will allow of such an
accurate enquiry: And there is no virtue or moral
duty, but what may, with facility, be refined away,
if we indulge a false philosophy, in sifting and scruti∣nizing
it, by every captious rule of logic, in every
light or position, in which it may be placed.</P>
<P>THE questions with regard to private property have
filled infinite volumes of law and philosophy, if in
both we add the commentators to the original text;
and in the end, we may safely pronounce, that many
of the rules, there established, are uncertain, ambi∣guous,
and arbitrary. The like opinion may be
formed with regard to the successions and rights of
princes and forms of government. Many cases, no
doubt, occur, especially in the infancy of any go∣vernment,
<PB N="309" REF="312"/>
which admit of no determination from the
laws of justice and equity: And our historian RAPIN,
allows, that the controversy between EDWARD the
the third and PHILLIP de VALOIS was of this nature,
and could be decided only by an appeal to heaven,
that is, by war and violence.</P>
<P>WHO shall tell me, whether GERMANICUS or
DRUSUS ought to have succeeded TIBERIUS, had he
died, while they were both alive, without naming
any of them for his successor? Ought the right of
adoption to be received as equivalent to that of blood,
in a nation, where it had the same effect in private
families, and had already, in two instances, taken
place in the public? Ought GERMANICUS to be
esteemed the eldest son because he was born before
DRUSUS; or the younger, because he was adopted
after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of the
elder to be regarded in a nation, where the eldest bro∣ther
had no advantage in the succession of private fa∣milies?
Ought the ROMAN empire, at that time,
to be esteemed hereditary, because of two examples;
or ought it, even so early, to be regarded as belong∣ing
to the stronger or the present possessor, as being
founded on so recent an usurpation?</P>
<P>COMMODUS mounted the throne after a pretty long
succession of excellent emperors, who had acquired
their title, not by birth, or public election, but by the
<PB N="310" REF="313"/>
fictitious rite of adoption. That bloody debauchee
being murdered by a conspiracy suddenly formed be∣tween
his wench and her gallant, who happened at
that time to be <HI>Praetorian Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fect,</HI> or to have the
command of the guards; these immediately delibe∣rated
about choosing a master to human kind, to speak
in the style of those ages; and cast their eyes on
PERTINAX. Before the tyrant's death was known,
the <HI>Praefect</HI> went secretly to that senator, who, on the
appearance of the soldiers, imagined that his execu∣tion
had been ordered by COMMODUS. He was im∣mediately
saluted emperor by the officer and his at∣tendants;
chearfully proclaimed by the populace;
unwillingly submitted to by the guards; formally re∣cognized
by the senate; and passively received by the
provinces and armies of the empire.</P>
<P>THE discontent of the <HI>Praetorian</HI> bands soon broke
out in a sudden sedition, which occasioned the mur∣ther
of that excellent prince: And the world being
now without a master and without government, the
guards thought proper to set the empire formally to
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le. JULIAN, the purchaser, was proclaimed by the
soldiers, recognized by the senate, and submitted to
by the people, and must also have been submitted to
by the provinces, had not the envy of the legions
begot opposition and resistance. PESCENNIUS NI∣GER
in SYRIA elected himself emperor, gained the
<PB N="311" REF="314"/>
tumultuary consent of his army, and was attended
with the secret good-will of the senate and people of
ROME. ALBINUS in BRITAIN found an equal right
to set up his claim; but SEVERUS, who governed
PANNONIA, prevailed in the end above both of them.
That able politician and warrior, finding his own
birth and dignity too much inferior to the imperial
crown, profest at first, an intention only of revenging
the death of PERTINAX. He marched as general in∣to
ITALY, defeated JULIAN; and without our be∣ing
able to fix any precise commencement even of the
soldiers consent, he was from necessity acknowledged
emperor by the senate and people; and fully esta∣bilshed
in his violent authority by subduing NIGER
and ALBINUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HERODIAN, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Inter baec Gordi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus</HI> CAESAR (says CAPITOLINUS,
speaking of another period) <HI>sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atus a militibus,</HI> Im∣perator
<HI>est appellatus, quia non erat alius in praesenti.</HI>
'Tis to be remarked that GORDIAN was a boy of
fourteen years of age.</P>
<P>FREQUENT instances of a like nature occur in the
history of the emperors; in that of ALEXANDER's
successors; and of many other countries: Nor can any
thing be more unhappy than a despotic government
of that kind; where the succession is disjointed and
irregular, and must be determined, on every occasion,
<PB N="312" REF="315"/>
by force or election. In a free government, the mat∣ter
is often unavoidable, and is also much less dange∣rous.
The interests of liberty may there frequently
lead the people, in their own defence, to alter the suc∣cessien
of the crown. And the constitution, being
compounded of parts, may still maintain a sufficient
stability, by resting on the aristocratical or democra∣tical
members, tho' the monarchical be altered, from
time to time, in order to accommodate it to the
former.</P>
<P>IN an absolute government, when there is no legal
prince, who has a title to the throne, it may safely
be determined to belong to the first occupier. In∣stances
of this kind are but too frequent, especially in
the eastern monarchies. When any race of princes
expires, the will or destination of the last sovereign
will be regarded as a title. Thus the edict of LEWIS
the XIVth, who called the bastard prince to the suc∣cession
in case of the failure of all the legitimate
princes, would, in such an event, have some autho∣rity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis remarkable, that in the remonstrance of the duke of BOUR<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ON and the legitimate princes, against this destination of LOUIS the XIVth, the doctrine of the <HI>original contract</HI> is insisted on, even in that absolute government. The FRENCH nation, say they, choosing HUGH CAPET and his posterity to rule over them and their posterity, where the former line sails, there is a tacit right reserved to choose a new royal family; and this right is invaded by calling the bastard princes to the throne, without the consent of the nation. But the Compte de BOULAINVIL∣LIERS, who wrote in defence of the bastard princes, ridicules this notion of an original contract, especially when applied to HUGH CAPET; who mounted the throne, says he, by the same arts, which have ever been employed by all conquerors and usurp∣ers. He got his title, indeed, recognized by the states after he had put himself in possession: But is this a choice or contract? The Compte de BOULAINVILLIERS, we may observe, was a noted republican; but being a man of learning, and very con∣versant in history, he knew the people were never almost con∣sulted in these revolutions and new establishments, and that time alone bestowed right and authority on what was commonly at first founded on foroe and violence. <HI>See Etai de la</HI> FRANCE, Vol. III.</NOTE>. Thus the will of CHARLES the second dis∣posed
<PB N="313" REF="316"/>
of the whole SPANISH monarchy. The cession
of the antient proprietor, especially when joined to
conquest, is likewise esteemed a very good title. The
general bond or obligation, which binds us to govern∣ment,
is the interest and necessities of society; and
this obligation is very strong. The determination of
it to this or that particular prince or form of govern∣ment
is frequently more uncertain and dubious. Pre∣sent
possession has considerable authority in these cases,
and greater than in private property; because of the
disorders, which attend all revolutions and changes
of government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The crime of rebellion, amongst the antients was com∣monly marked by the terms <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>novas res <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

WE shall only observe, before we conclude, that
tho' an appeal to general opinion may justly, in the
speculative sciences of metaphysics, natural philosophy,
or astronomy, be esteemed unfair and inconclusive,
yet in all questions with regard to morals, as well as
criticism, there is really no other standard, by which
any controversy can ever be decided. And nothing
is a clearer proof, that a theory of this kind is erro∣neous,
than to find, that it leads to paradoxes, which
are repugnant to the common sentiments of mankind,
and to the practice and opinion of all nations and
all ages. The doctrine, which founds all lawful go∣vernment
to an <HI>original contract,</HI> or consent of the
people, is plainly of this kind; nor has the ablest of
its partizans, in prosecution of it, scrupled to affirm,
<HI>that absolute monarchy is inconsistent with civil society,
and so can be no form of civil government at all</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See LOCKE on government, chap. 7. §. 90.</NOTE>; <HI>and
that the supreme power in a state cannot take from any
man by taxes and impositions, any part of his property,
without his own consent or that of his representatives</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. chap. 11. §. 138, 139, 140.</NOTE>.
What authority any moral reasoning can have, which
leads into opinions, so wide of the general practice of
mankind, in every place but this single kingdom, 'tis
easy to determine<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>The only passage I meet with in antiquity, where the obli∣gation of obedience to government is ascribed to a promise is in PLATO <HI>in Critone;</HI> where SOCRATES refuses to escape from prison, because he had tacitly promised to obey the laws.

<P>As the obligation to justice is founded intirely on
the interests of society, which require mutual absti∣nence
from property, in order to preserve peace among

justice would be attended with very pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous conse∣quences,
that virtue must be suspended, and give place
to public utility, in such extraordinary and such press∣ing
emergencies. The maxim, <HI>siat Justitia &amp; ruat

destroyed, is apparently false, and by sacrificing the
end to the means, shews a preposterous idea of the
<PB N="318" REF="320"/>
subordination of duties. What governor of a town
makes any scruple of burning the suburbs, when they
facilitate the advances of the enemy? Or what ge∣neral
abstains from plundering a neutral country,
when the necessities of war require it, and he cannot
otherwise maintain his army? The case is the same
with the duty of allegiance; and common sense teaches
us, that as government obliges to obedience only on
account of its tendency to public utility, that duty
must always, in extraordinary cases, when public ruin
would evidently attend obedience, yield <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the pri∣mary
and original obligation. <HI>Salus p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>puli suprema
Lex,</HI> the safety of the people is the supreme law.
This maxim is agreeable to the sentiments of man∣kind
in all ages: Nor is any one, when he reads of
the insurrections against a NERO, or a PHILIP, so in∣fatuated
with party-systems, as not to wish success to
the enterprize, and praise the undertakers. Even our
high monarchical party, in spite of their sublime the∣ory,
are forced, in such cases, to judge, and feel,
and approve, in conformity to the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>RESISTANCE, therefore, being admitted in extra∣ordinary
emergencies, the question can only be, a∣mong
good reasoners, with regard to the degree of
necessity, which can justify resistance, and render it
lawful or commendable. And here I must confess,
that I shall always incline to <HI>their</HI> side, who draw the
bond of allegiance the closest possible, and consider
<PB N="319" REF="321"/>
an infringement of it, as the last refuge in desperate
cases, when the public is in the highest danger, from
violence and tyranny. For besides the mischiefs of a
civil war, which commonly attends insurrection; 'tis
certain, that where a disposition to rebellion appears
among any people, it is one chief cause of tyranny
in the rulers, and forces them into many violent mea∣sures,
which they never would have embraced, had
every one seemed inclined to submission and obedi∣ence.
'Tis thus the <HI>tyrannicide</HI> or assassination, ap∣proved
of by ancient maxims, instead of keeping ty∣rants
and usurpers in awe, made them ten times more
fierce and unrelenting; and is now justly, upon that
account, abolished by the laws of nations, and uni∣versally
condemned as a base and treacherous method
of bringing to justice these disturbers of society.</P>
<P>BESIDES; we must consider, that as obedience is
our duty in the common course of things, it ought
chiefly to be inculcated; nor can any thing be more
preposterous than an anxious care and sollicitude in
stating all the cases, in which resistance may be al∣lowed.
Thus, tho' a philosopher reasonably acknow∣ledges,
in the course of an argument, that the rules
of justice may be dispensed with in cases of urgent
necessity; what should we think of a preacher or ca∣suist,
who should make it his chief study to find out
such cases, and enforce them with all the vehemence
of argument and eloquence? Would he not be bet∣ter
<PB N="320" REF="322"/>
employed in inculcating the general doctrine, than
in displaying the particular exceptions, which we are,
perhaps, but too much inclined, of ourselves, to em∣brace,
and to extend?</P>
<P>THERE are, however, two reasons, which may be
pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed in defence of that party among us, who have,
with so much industry, propagated the maxims of re∣sistance;
maxims, which, it must be confest, are, in
general, so pernicious, and so destructive of civil so∣ciety.
The <HI>first</HI> is, that their antagonists carrying
the doctrine of obedience to such an extravagant
height, as not only never to mention the exceptions
in extraordinary cases (which might, perhaps, be ex∣cusabie)
but even positively to exclude them; it be∣came
necessary to insist on these exceptions, and de∣fend
the rights of injured truth and liberty. The <HI>se∣cond,</HI>
and, perhaps, better reason, is founded on the
nature of the BRITISH constitution and form of go∣vernment.</P>
<P>'TIS
almost peculiar to our constitution to establish
a first magistrate with such high pre-eminence and
dignity, that, tho' limited by the laws, he is, in a
manner, so far as regards his own person, above the
laws, and can neither be questioned nor punished for
any injury or wrong, which may be committed by
him. His ministers alone, or those who act by his
commission, are obnoxious to ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ice; and while the
<PB N="321" REF="323"/>
prince is thus allured, by the prospect of personae
safety, to give the laws their free course, an equal se∣curity
is, in effect, obtained, by the punishment of
lesser offenders, and at the same time a civil war is
avoided, which would be the infallible consequence,
were an attack, at every turn, made directly upon
the sovereign. But tho' the constitution pays this sa∣lutary
compliment to the prince, it can never reason∣ably
be understood, by that maxim, to have deter∣mined
its own destruction, or to have established a
tame submission▪ where he protects his ministers, pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣severes
in injustice, and usurps the whole power of the
commonwealth. This case, indeed, is never expressly
put by the laws; because it is impossible for them, in
their ordinary course, to provide a remedy for it, or esta∣blish
any magistrate, with superior authority, to chastise
the exorbitancies of the prince. But as a right without
a remedy would be the greatest of all absurdities; the
remedy in this case, is the extraordinary one of resist∣ance,
when affairs come to that extremity, that the con∣stitution
can be defended by it alone. Resistance, there∣fore,
must, of course, become more frequent in the BRI∣TISH
government, than in others, which are simpler,
and consist of fewer parts and movements. Where the
king is an absolute sovereign, he has little temp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣tion
to commit such enormous tyranny as may justly
provoke rebellion; But where he is limited, his im∣prudent
ambition, without any great vices, may run
<PB N="322" REF="324"/>
him into that perilous situation. This is commonly
supposed to have been the case with CHARLES the
First; and if we may now speak truth, after animo∣sities
are laid, this was also the case with JAMES the
Second. These were harmless, if not, in their pri∣vate
character, good men; but mistaking the nature
of our constitution, and engrossing the whole legisla∣tive
power, it became necessary to oppose them with
some vehemence; and even to deprive the latter for∣mally
of that authority, which he had used with such
imprudence and indiscretion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the COALITION of PARTIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO abolish all distinctions of party may not be
practicable, perhaps not desirable, in a free
government. The only parties, which are dange∣rous,
are such as entertain opposite views with regard
to the essentials of government, the succession of the
crown, or the more considerable privileges belonging
to the several members of the constitution; where
there is no room for any compromize or accommoda∣tion,
and where the controversy may appear so mo∣mentous
as to justify even an opposition by arms to
the pretensions of antagonists. Of this nature was
the animosity continued for above a century between
the parties in ENGLAND; an animosity which broke
out sometimes into civil war, which occasioned violent
revolutions, and which continually endangered the
peace and tranquillity of the nation. But as there
has appeared of late the strongest symptoms of an
universal desire to abolish these party-distinctions;

prospect of future happiness, and ought to be care∣fully
cherished and promoted by every lover of his
country.</P>
<P>THERE is not a more effectual method of promot∣ing
so good an end, than to prevent all unreasonable
insult and triumph of the one party over the other,
to encourage moderate opinions, to find the proper
medium in all disputes, to persuade each that its an∣tagonist
may possibly be sometimes in the right, and
to keep a balance in the praise and blame which we
bestow on either side. The two former Essays, con∣cerning
the <HI>original contract</HI> and <HI>passive obedience,</HI> are
calculated for this purpose with regard to the <HI>philoso∣phical</HI>
controversies between the parties, and tend to
show that neither side are in these respects so fully
supported by reason as they endeavour to flatter them∣selves.
We shall proceed to exercise the same mode∣ration
with regard to the <HI>historical</HI> disputes between
the parties, by proving that each of them was justified
by plausible topics; that there were on both sides
wise men who meant well to their country, and
that the past animosity between the parties had no bet∣ter
foundation than narrow prejudice or interested
passion.</P>
<P>THE popular party, who afterwards acquired the
name of whigs, might justify by very specious argu∣ments,
<PB N="325" REF="331"/>
that opposition to the crown, from which our
present free constitution is derived. Tho' obliged to
acknowledge, that precedents in favour of preroga∣tive
had uniformly taken place during many reigns
before CHARLES the First, they thought, that there
was no reason for submitting any longer to so dange∣rous
an authority. Such might have been their rea∣soning:
The rights of mankind are so sacred, that no
prescription of tyranny or arbitrary power can have
authority sufficient to abolish them. Liberty is so in∣estimable
a blessing, that, wherever there appears any
probability of recovering it, a nation may willingly
run many hazards, and ought not even to repine at
the greatest effasion of blood or treasure. All human
institutions, and none more than government, are in
continual fluctuation. Kings are sure to embrace
every opportunity of extending their prerogatives:
And if favourable incidents be not also laid hold of
to extend and secure the privileges of the people,
an universal despotism must for ever prevail amongst
mankind. The example of all the neighbouring na∣tions
prove, that it is no longer safe to entrust with
the crown the same exorbitant prerogatives which had
forme<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly been exercised during rude and simple ages.
And tho' the example of many late reigns may be
pleaded in favour of a power in the prince somewhat
arbitrary, more remote reigns afford instances of stricter
limitations imposed on the crown; and those preten∣sions
of the parliament, now branded with the title
<PB N="326" REF="332"/>
of innovations, are only a recovery of the just rights
of the people.</P>
<P>THESE views, far from being odious, are surely
large, and generous, and noble: To their prevalence
and success the kingdom owes its liberty; perhaps
its learning, its industry, commerce, and naval power:
By them chiefly the ENGLISH name is distinguished
among the society of nations, and aspires to a rival∣ship
with that of the freest and most illustrious com∣monwealths
of antiquity. But as all these mighty
consequences could not reasonably be foreseen at the
time when the contest began, the royalists of that age
wanted not specious arguments on their side, by which
they could justify their defence of the then established
prerogatives of the crown. We shall state the ques∣tion,
as it might appear to them at the assembling of
that parliament, which by their violent encroachments
on the crown, began the civil wars.</P>
<P>THE only rule of government, they might have
said, known and acknowleged among men, is use
and practice: Reason is so uncertain a guide that it
will always be exposed to doubt and controversy:
Could it ever render itself prevalent over the people,
men had always retained it as their sole rule of con∣duct:
They had still continued in the primitive, un∣connected
state of nature, without submitting to po∣litical
government, whose sole basis is, not pure rea∣son,
<PB N="327" REF="333"/>
but authority and precedent. Dissolve these tyes,
and you break all the bonds of civil society, and leave
every man at liberty to consult his particular interest,
by those expedients, which his appetite, disguised
under the appearance of reason, shall dictate to him.
The spirit of innovation is in itself pernicious, however
favourable its particular object may sometimes ap∣pear:
A truth so obvious, that the popular party
themselves are sensible of it, and therefore cover their
encroachments on the crown by the plausible pre∣tence
of their recovering the antient liberties of the
people.</P>
<P>BUT the present prerogatives of the crown, grant∣ing
all the suppositions of that party, have been in∣contestibly
established ever since the accession of the
House of TUDOR; a period, which, as it now com∣prehends
an hundred and sixty years, may be allowed
sufficient to give stability to any constitution. Would
it not have appeared ridiculous, in the reign of the
Emperor ADRIAN, to talk of the constitution of the
republic as the rule of government; or to suppose
that the former rights of the senate, and consuls and
tribunes were still subsisting?</P>
<P>BUT the present claims of the ENGLISH monarchs
are infinitely more favourable than those of the RO∣MAN
emperors during that age. The authority of
<PB N="328" REF="334"/>
AUGUSTUS was a plain usurpation, grounded only
on military violence, and forms such an Aera in the
ROMAN history, as is obvious to every reader. But
if HENRY VII. really, as some pretend, enlarged
the power of the crown, it was only by insensible ac∣quisitions,
which escaped the apprehension of the
people, and have scarcely been remarked even by
historians and politicians. The new government, if
it deserves the name, is an imperceptible transition
from the former; is entirely engrafted on it; derives
its title fully from that root; and is to be considered
only as one of those gradual revolutions, to which
human affairs, in every nation, will be for ever
subject.</P>
<P>THE House of TUDOR, and after them that of
STUART, exercised no prerogatives, but what had
been claimed and exercised by the PLANTAGENETS.
Not a single branch of their authority can be said to
be altogether an innovation. The only difference is,
that perhaps the former kings exerted these powers only
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntervals, and were not able by reason of the opposi∣tion
of their barons, to render them so steddy a rule of
administration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The author believes that he was the first writer who ad∣vanced that the family of TUDOR possessed in general more au∣thority than their immediate predecessors: An opinion, which, he hopes, will be supported by history, but which he proposes with some diffidence. There are strong symptoms of arbitrary power in some former reigns, even after signing of the char∣ters. The power of the crown in that age depended less on the constitution than on the capacity and vigour of the prince who wore it.</NOTE>. But the sole inference from this fact
<PB N="329" REF="335"/>
is, that these antient times were more turbulent and
seditious; and that royal authority, the constitution,
and the laws have happily of late gained the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cendant.</P>
<P>UNDER
what pretence can the popular party now
talk of recovering the antient constitution? The
former controul over the kings was not placed in the
commons, but in the barons: The people had no au∣thority,
and even little or no liberty, till the crown,
by suppessing these factious tyrants, enforced the
execution of the laws, and obliged all the subjects
equally to respect each others rights, privileges, and
properties. If we must return to the antient barba∣rous
and GOTHIC constitution; let those gentlemen,
who now behave themselves with so much insolence
to their sovereign, set the first example. Let them
make court to be admitted as retainers on a neigh∣bouring
baron; and by submitting to slavery under
him acquire some protection to themselves; together
with the power of exercising rapine and oppression
over their inferior slaves and villains. This was the
<PB N="330" REF="336"/>
condition of the commons among their remote ances∣tors.</P>
<P>BUT how far back shall we go, in having recourse
to antient constitutions and governments? There was
a constitution still more antient than that to which their
innovators affect so much to appeal. During that
period there was no <HI>magna charta:</HI> The barons them∣selves
possessed few regular, stated privileges: And
the house of commons probably had not an exist∣ence.</P>
<P>IT is pleasant to hear a house, while they are usurp∣ing
the whole power of government, talk of reviving
antient institutions. Is it not known, that, tho' the
representatives received wages from their constituents;
to be a member of their house was always considered
as a burthen, and a freedom from it as a privilege?
Will they persuade us, that power, which of all hu∣man
acquisitions is the most coveted, and in compa∣rison
of which even reputation and pleasure and riches
are stighted, could ever be regarded as a burthen by
any man?</P>
<P>THE property acquired of late by the commons,
it is said, entitles them to more power than their an∣cestors
enjoyed. But to what is this encrease of their
property owing, but to an encrease of their liberty
and their security? Let them therefore acknowledge,
<PB N="331" REF="337"/>
that their ancestors, while the crown was restrained
by the seditious barons, really enjoyed less liberty
than they themselves have attained, after the sovereign
acquired the ascendant: And let them enjoy that li∣berty
with moderation; and not forfeit it by new
exorbitant claims, and by rendering it a pretence for
endless innovations.</P>
<P>THE true rule of government is the present esta∣blished
practice of the age. That has most authority,
because it is recent: It is also better known, for the
same reason. Who has assured those tribunes, that
the PLANTAGENETS did not exercise as high acts of
authority as the TUDORS? The historians, they say,
do not mention them. But the historians are also
silent with regard to the chief exertions of prerogative
by the TUDORS. Where any power or prerogative is
fully and undoubtedly established, the exercise of it
passes for a thing of course, and readily escapes the
notice of history and annals. Had we no other mo∣numents
of ELIZABETH's reign, than what are pre∣served
even by CAMDEN, the most copious, judicious,
and exact of our historians, we should be entirely ig∣norant
of the most important maxims of her govern∣ment.</P>
<P>WAS not the present monarchical government, to
its full extent, authorized by lawyers, recommended
by divines, acknowledged by politicians, acquiesced
<PB N="332" REF="338"/>
in, nay passionately cherished, by the people in gene∣ral;
and all this during a period of at least a hun∣dred
and sixty years, and till of late, without the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>east
murmur or controversy? This general consent surely,
during so long a time, must be sufficient to render a
constitution legal and valid. If the origin of all power
be derived, as is pretended, from the people; here
is their consent in the fullest and most ample terms
that can be de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired or imagined.</P>
<P>BUT the people must not pretend, because they
can, by their consent, lay the foundations of govern∣ment,
that therefore they are to be permitted, at
their pleasure, to overthrow and subvert them. There
is no end of these seditious and arrogant claims. The
power of the crown is now openly struck at: The
nobility are also in visible peril: The gentry will soon
follow: The popular leaders, who will then assume
the name of gentry, will next be exposed to danger:
And the people themselves, become incapable of civil
government, and lying under the restraint of no au∣thority,
must, for the sake of peace, admit, instead
of their legal and mild monarchs, a succession of mi∣litary
and despotic tyrants.</P>
<P>THESE consequences are the more to be dreaded,
that the present fury of the people, tho' glossed over
by pretensions to civil liberty, is in reality incited by
the fanaticisms of religion; a principle the most blind,
<PB N="333" REF="339"/>
headstrong and ungovernable, by which human na∣ture
can ever possibly be actuated. Popular rage is
dreadful from whatever motive derived: But must be
attended with the most pernicious consequences, when
it arises from a principle, which disclaims all controul
by human law, reason, or authority.</P>
<P>THESE are the arguments, which each party may
make use of to justify the conduct of their prede∣cessors,
during that great crisis. The event has
shown, that the reasonings of the popular party were
better founded; but perhaps, according to the esta∣blished
maxims of lawyers and politicians, the views
of the royalists ought, beforehand, to have appeared
more solid, more safe, and more legal. But this is
certain, that the greater moderation we now employ
in representing past events; the nearer we shall be to
produce a full coalition of the parties, and an entire
acquiescence in our present happy establishment. Mo∣deration
is of advantage to every establishment: No∣thing
but zeal can overturn a settled power: And an
over-active zeal in friends is apt to beget a like spirit
in antagonists. The transition from a moderate op∣position
against an establishment, to an entire acquies∣cence
in it is easy and insensible.</P>
<P>THERE are many invincible arguments, which
should induce the malecontent party to acquiesce en∣tirely
<PB N="334" REF="340"/>
in the present settlement of the constitution.
They now find, that the spirit of civil liberty, tho'
at first conneced with religious fanaticism, could purge
itself from that pollution, and appear under a more
genuine and engaging aspect; a friend to toleration,
and an encourager of all the enlarged and generous sen∣timents,
that do honour to human nature. They may
observe, that the popular claims could stop at a pro∣per
period; and after retrenching the exorbitant pre∣rogatives
of the crown, could still maintain a due re∣spect
to monarchy, to nobility, and to all antient in∣stitutions.
Above all, they must be sensible, that the
very principle, which made the strength of their party,
and from which it derived its chief authority, has now
deserted them, and gone over to their antagonists.
The plan of liberty is settled; its happy effects are
proved by experience; a long tract of time has given
it stability; and whoever would attempt to overturn it,
and to recall the past government or abdicated, family,
would, besides other more criminal imputations, be
exposed in their turn to the reproach of faction and
innovation. While they peruse the history of past
events, they ought to reflect, both that these rights
of the crown are long since annihilated, and that the
tyranny, and violence, and oppression, to which they
often gave rise, are ills, from which the established
liberty of the constitution has now at last happily pro∣tected
<PB N="335" REF="341"/>
the people. These reflections will prove a bet∣ter
security to our freedom and privileges, than to
deny, contrary to the clearest evidence of facts, that
such regal powers ever had any existence. There
is not a more effectual method of betraying a cause,
than to lay the stress of the argument on a wrong
place, and by disputing an untenable post, enure the
adversaries to success and victory.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the PROTESTANT SUCCESSION.</HEAD>
<P>I SUPPOSE, that a member of parliament, in
the reign of King WILLIAM or Queen ANNE,
while the establishment of the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> was
yet uncertain, were deliberating concerning the party
he would choose in that important question, and
weighing, with impartiality, the advantages and dis∣advantages
on each side. I believe the following
particulars would have entered into his conside∣ration.</P>
<P>HE would easily perceive the great advantages re∣sulting
from the restoration of the STUART family;
by which we should preserve the succession clear
and undisputed, free from a pretender, with such a
specious title as that of blood, which, with the mul∣titude,
is always the claim, the strongest and most
easily comprehended. 'Tis in vain to say, as many
have done, that the question with regard to <HI>governors,</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="343"/>
independent of <HI>government,</HI> is frivolous, and little
worth disputing, much less fighting about. The ge∣nerality
of mankind never will enter into these senti∣ments;
and 'tis much happier, I believe, for society,
that they do not, but rather continue in their natural
prejudices and prepossessions. How could stability be
preserved in any monarchical government, (which,
tho' perhaps, not the best, is, and always has been,
the most common of any) unless men had so passionate
a regard for the true heir of their royal family; and
even tho' weak in understanding, or infirm in years,
gave him so great a preference above persons the most
accomplished in shining talents, or celebrated for
great atchievements? Would not every popular leader
put in his claim at every vacancy, or even without any
vacancy; and the kingdom become the theatre of
perpetual wars and convulsions? The condition of
the ROMAN empire, surely, was not, in this respect,
much to be envied; nor is that of the <HI>Eastern</HI> na∣tions,
who pay little regard to the title of their sove∣reigns,
but sacrifice them, every day, to the caprice
or momentary humour of the populace or soldiery.
'Tis but a foolish wisdom, which is so carefully dis∣played,
in undervaluing princes, and placing them on
a level with the meanest of mankind. To be sure,
an anatomist finds no more in the greatest monarch
than in the lowest peasant or day labourer; and a
moralist may, perhaps, frequently find less. But
<PB N="339" REF="344"/>
what do all these reflections tend to? We, all of
us, still retain these prejudices in favour of birth and
family; and neither in our serious occupations, nor
most careless amusements, can we ever get entirely
rid of them. A tragedy, that should represent the
adventures of sailors, or porters, or even of private
gentlemen, would presently disgust us; but one that
introduces kings and princes, acquires in our eyes an air
of importance and dignity. Or should a man be able,
by his superior wisdom, to get entirely above such
prepossessions, he would soon, by means of the same
wisdom, again bring himself down to them, for the
sake of society, whose welfare he would perceive to
be intimately connected with them. Far from endea∣vouring
to undeceive the people in this particular, he
would cherish such sentiments of reverence to their
princes; as requisite to preserve a due subordination
in society. And tho' the lives of twenty thousand
men be often sacrificed to maintain a king in posses∣sion
of his throne, or preserve the right of succession
undisturbed, he entertains no indignation at the loss,
on pretence that every individual of these was, per∣haps,
in himself, as valuable as the prince he served.
He considers the consequences of violating the here∣ditary
rights of kings: Consequences, which may be
felt for many centuries; while the loss of several
thousand men brings so little prejudice to a large
kingdom, that it may not be perceived a few years
afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="345"/>
THE advantages of the HANOVER succession are
of an opposite nature, and arise from this very cir∣cumstance,
that it violates hereditary right; and
places on the throne a prince, to whom birth gave
no title to that dignity. 'Tis evident to any one who
considers the history of this island, that the privileges
of the people have, during the two last centuries,
been continually upon the increase, by the division of
the church-lands, by the alienations of the barons
estates, by the progress of trade, and above all, by
the happiness of our situation, which, for a long
time, gave us sufficient security, without any standing
army or military establishment. On the contrary,
public liberty has, almost in every other nation of
EUROPE, been, during the same period, extremely
upon the decline; while the people were disgusted at
the hardships of the old GOTHIC militia, and chose
rather to intrust their prince with mercenary armies,
which he easily turned against themselves. It was no∣thing
extraordinary, therefore, that some of our BRI∣TISH
sovereigns mistook the nature of the constitu∣tion,
and genius of the people; and as they embraced
all the favourable precedents left them by their ances∣tors,
they overlooked all those which were contrary,
and which supposed a limitation in our government.
They were encouraged in this mistake, by the ex∣ample
of all the neighbouring princes, who, bearing
the same title or appellation, and being adorned with
the same ensigns of authority, naturally led them to
<PB N="341" REF="346"/>
claim the same powers and prerogatives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from the speeches, and proclamations, and whole train of King JAMES I.'s actions, as well as his son's, that they considered the ENGLISH government as a simple monarchy, and never imagined that any considerable part of their subjects enter∣tained a contrary idea. This made them discover their preten∣sions, without preparing any force to support them; and even without reserve or disguise, which are always employed by those, who enter upon any new project, or endeavour to innovate in any government. King JAMES told his parliament plainly, when they meddled<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in state affairs, <HI>Ne sutor ultra crepidam.</HI> He used also, at his table, in promiscuous companies, to advance his notions, in a manner still more undisguised: As we may learn from a story told in the life of Mr. WALLER, and which that poet used frequently to repeat. When Mr. WALLER was young, he had the curiosity to go to court; and he stood in the circle, and saw King JAMES dine, where, amongst other company, there sat at table two bishops. The King, openly and aloud, pro∣posed this question, <HI>Whether he might not take bis subjects money, when he had occasion for it, without all this formality of parliament?</HI> The one bishop readily replied, <HI>God forbid you should not: For you are the breath of our nostri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> The other bishop declined answer∣ing, and said he was not skilled in parliamentary cases: But up∣on the King's urging him, and saying he would admit of no evasion, his lordship replied very pleasantly, <HI>Why, then, I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother's money: For he offers it.</HI> In Sir WALTER RALEIGH'S preface to the History of the World, there is this remarkable passage. PHILIP II. <HI>by strong hand and main force, attempted to make himself not only an</HI> absolute monarch <HI>over the</HI> Netherlands, <HI>like unto the kings and sovereigns of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> France; <HI>but</HI> Turk-like, <HI>to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws, privileges, and antient rights.</HI> SPENSER, speaking of some grants of the ENGLISH kings to the IRISH corporations, says, “All which, tho', at the time of their first grant, they were tolerable, and perhaps reason∣able, yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient. But all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her Majesty's prerogative, against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or inforced.” <HI>State of</HI> IRELAND, p. 1537. Edit. 1706.</P>
<P>As these were very common, if not, perhaps, the universal notions of the times, the two first princes of the house of STUART were the more excusable for their mistake. And R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>IN, suitable to his usual malignity and partiality, seems to treat them with too much severity, upon account of it.</P></NOTE>. The flat∣tery
of courtiers farther blinded them; and above all,
<PB N="342" REF="347"/>
that of the clergy, who from several passages of <HI>scrip∣ture,</HI>
and these wrested too, had erected a regular and
avowed system of tyranny and despotic power. The
only method of destroying, at once, all these exorbi∣tant
claims and pretensions, was to depart from the
true hereditary line, and choose a prince, who, being
plainly a creature of the public, and receiving the
crown on conditions, expressed and avowed, found
his authority established on the same bottom with the
privileges of the people. By electing him in the royal
line, we cut off all hopes of ambitious subjects, who
<PB N="343" REF="348"/>
might, in future emergencies, disturb the government
by their cabals and pretensions: By rendering the
crown hereditary in his family, we avoided all the in∣conveniencies
of elective monarchy: And by exclu∣ding
the lineal heir, we secured all our constitutional
limitations, and rendered our government uniform
and of a piece. The people cherish monarchy, be∣cause
protected by it: The monarch favours liberty.
because created by it. And thus every advantage is
obtained by the new establishment, as far as human
skill and wisdom can extend itself.</P>
<P>THESE are the separate advantages of fixing the
succession, either in the house of STUART, or in that
of HANOVER. There are also disadvantages in each
establishment, which an impartial partriot would pon∣der
and examine, in order to form a just judgment up∣on
the whole.</P>
<P>THE disadvantages of the Protestant succession con∣fist
in the foreign dominions, which are possessed by
the princes of the HANOVER line, and which, it
might be supposed, would engage us in the intrigues
and wars of the continent, and lose us, in some mea∣sure,
the inestimable advantage we possess of being
surrounded and guarded by the sea, which we com∣mand.
The disadvantages of recalling the abdicated
family consist chiefly in their religion, which is more
prejudicial to society than that established amongst us,
<PB N="344" REF="349"/>
is contrary to it, and affords no toleration, or peace,
or s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urity to any other religion.</P>
<P>IT appears to me, that all these advantages and
disadvantages are allowed on both sides; at least, by
every one, who is at all susceptible of argument or
reasoning. No subject, however loyal, pretends to
deny, that the disputed title and foreign dominions
of the present royal family are a loss. Nor is there
any parti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n of the STUART family, but will confess,
that the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aim of hereditary, indefeasible right, and
the Roman Catholic religion, are also disadvantages
in that family. It belongs, therefore, to a philo∣sopher
alone, who is of neither party, to put all these
circumstances in the scale, and assign to each of them
its proper poise and influence. Such an one will rea∣dily,
at first, acknowledge, that all political questions
are infinitely complicated, and that there scarce ever
occurs in any deliberation, a choice, which is either
purely good, or purely ill. Consequences, mixed
and varied, may be foreseen to flow from every mea∣sure:
And many consequences, unforeseen, do always'
in fact, result from it. Hesitation, and reserve, and
suspense, are, therefore, the only sentiments he brings
to this essay or trial. Or if he indulges any passion,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is that of derision and ridicule against the ignorant
multitude, who are always clamorous and dogmatical,
even in the nicest questions, of which, from want or
<PB N="345" REF="350"/>
temper, perhaps still more than of understanding,
they are altogether unfit judges.</P>
<P>BUT to say something more determinate on this
head, the following reflections will, I hope, show the
temper, if not the understanding, of a philosopher.</P>
<P>WERE we to judge merely by first appearance, and
by past experience, we must allow that the advantages
of a parliamentary title in the house of HANOVER are
much greater than those of an undisputed hereditary
title in the house of STUART; and that our fathers
acted wisely in preferring the former to the latter. So
long as the house of STUART reigned in BRITAIN,
which, with some interruption, was above 80 years,
the government was kept in a continual fever, by the
contentions between the privileges of the people and
the prerogatives of the crown. If arms were dropt,
the noise of disputes continued: Or if these were si∣lenced,
jealousy still corroded the heart, and threw
the nation into an unnatural ferment and disorder.
And while we were thus occupied in domestic con∣tentions,
a foreign power, dangerous, if not fatal, to
public liberty, erected itself in EUROPE, without any
opposition from us, and even sometimes with our as∣sistance.</P>
<P>BUT during these last sixty years, when a parlia∣mentary
establishment has taken place; whatever
<PB N="346" REF="351"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>actions may have prevailed either among the people
or in public assemblies, the whole force of our consti∣tution
has always fallen to one side, and an uninter∣rupted
harmony has been preserved between our
pri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es and our parliaments. Public liberty, with in∣ternal
peace and order, has flourished almost without
interruption: Trade, and manufactures, and agri∣culture,
have increased: The arts, and sciences, and
philosophy, have been cultivated. Even religious par∣ties
have been necessitated to lay aside their mutual
rancour: And the glory of the nation has spread itself
all over EUROPE; while we stand the bulwark a∣gainst
oppression, and the great antagonist of that
power which threatens every people with conquest
and subjection. So long and so glorious a period no
nation almost can boast of: Nor is there another in∣stance
in the whole history of mankind, that so many
millions of people have, during such a space of time,
been held together, in a manner so free, so rational,
and so suitable to the dignity of human nature.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this recent instance seems clearly to de∣cide
in favour of the present establishment, there are
some circumstances to be thrown into the other scale;
and 'tis dangerous to regulate our judgment by one
event or example.</P>
<P>WE have had two rebellions during the flourishing
period above mentioned, besides plots and conspira∣cies
<PB N="347" REF="352"/>
without number. And if none of these have pro∣duced
any very fatal event, we may ascribe our escape
chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes who dis∣puted
our establishment; and may esteem ourselves so
far fortunate. But the claims of the banished family,
I fear, are not yet antiquated; and who can foretel,
that their future attempts will produce no greater dis∣order?</P>
<P>THE disputes betwixt privilege and prerogative
may easily be composed by laws, and votes, and con∣ferences,
and concessions; where there is tolerable
temper or prudence on both sides, or on either side.
Among contending titles, the question can only be de∣termined
by the sword, and by devastation, and by
civil war.</P>
<P>A PRINCE who fills the throne with a disputed title,
dares not arm his subjects; the only method of secu∣ring
a people fully, both against domestic oppression
and foreign conquest.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all our riches and renown,
what a critical escape did we lately make from dan∣gers,
which were owing not so much to bad conduct
and ill success in war, as to the pernicious practice of
mortgaging our finances, and the still more pernicious
maxim of never paying off our incumbrances? Such
<PB N="348" REF="353"/>
fatal measures could never have been embraced, had
it not been to secure a precarious establishment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those who consider how universal this pernicious practice of funding has become all over EUROPE, may perhaps dispute this last opinion. But we lay under less necessity than other states.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT to convince us, that an hereditary title is to be
embraced rather than a parliamentary one, which is
not supported by any other views or motives; a man
needs only transport himself back to the aera of the re∣storation,
and suppose, that he had had a seat in that
parliament which recalled the royal family, and put a
period to the greatest disorders that ever arose from
the opposite pretensions of prince and people. What
would have been thought of one, that had proposed,
at that time, to set aside CHARLES II. and settle the
crown on the Duke of YORK or GLOCESTER, mere∣ly
in order to exclude all high claims, like those of
their father and grandfather? Would not such an one
have been regarded as a very extravagant projector,
who loved dangerous remedies, and could tamper and
play with a government and national constitution, like
a quack with a sickly patien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>?</P>
<P>THE advantages which result from a parliamentary
title, preferably to an hereditary one, tho' they are great,
are too refined ever to enter into the conception of
<PB N="349" REF="354"/>
the vulgar. The bulk of mankind would never al∣low
them to be sufficient for committing what would
be regarded as an injustice to the prince. They must
be supported by some gross, popular, and familiar to∣pics;
and wise men, tho' convinced of their force,
would reject them, in compliance with the weakness
and prejudices of the people. An incroaching tyrant
or deluded bigot alone, by his misconduct, is able to
enrage the nation, and render practicable what was
always, perhaps, desireable.</P>
<P>IN reality, the reason assigned by the nation for ex∣cluding
the race of STUART, and so many other
branches of the royal family, is not on account of their
hereditary title (which, however just in itself, would,
to vulgar apprehensions, have appeared altogether ab∣surd)
but on account of their religion. Which leads
us to compare the disadvantages above mentioned of
each establishment.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, that, considering the matter in gene∣ral,
it were rather to be wished, that our prince had
no foreign dominions, and could confine all his atten∣tion
to the government of this island. For, not to
mention some real inconveniencies that may result
from territories on the continent, they afford such a
handle for calumny and defamation, as is greedily
seized by the people, who are always disposed to
think ill of their superiors. It must, however, be ac∣knowledged,
<PB N="350" REF="355"/>
that HANOVER is, perhaps, the spot of
ground in EUROPE the least inconvenient for a King
of BRITAIN. It lies in the heart of GERMANY, at a
distance from the great powers, which are our natural
rivals: It is protected by the laws of the empire, as
well as by the arms of its own sovereign, and it serves
only to connect us more closely with the house of
AUSTRIA, which is our natural ally.</P>
<P>IN the last war, it has been of service to us, by fur∣nishing
us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops,
the bravest and most faithful in the world. The
Elector of HANOVER is the only considerable prince in
the empire, who has pursued no separate end, and
has raised up no stale pretensions, during the late
commotions of EUROPE; but has acted, all along,
with the dignity of a king of BRITAIN. And ever
since the accession of that family, it would be difficult
to show any harm we have ever received from the
electoral dominions, except that short disgust in 1718,
with CHARLES XII. who, regulating himself by
maxims very different from those of other princes,
made a personal quarrel of every public injury.</P>
<P>THE religious persuasion of the house of STUART
is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye, and would
threaten us with much more dismal consequences.
The Roman Catholic religion, with its huge train of
priests and friers, is vastly more expensive than ours:
<PB N="351" REF="356"/>
Even tho' unaccompanied with its natural attendants
of inquisitors, and stakes, and gibbets, it is less tole∣rating:
And not contented with dividing the sacer∣dotal
from the regal office (which must be prejudicial
to any state) it bestows the former on a foreigner,
who has always a separate, and may often have an
opposite interest to that of the public.</P>
<P>BUT were this religion ever so advantageous to
society, it is contrary to that which is established
among us, and which is likely to keep possession, for a
long time, of the minds of the people. And tho' it
is much to be hoped, that the progress of reason and
philosophy will, by degrees, abate the virulent a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ri∣mony
of opposite religions all over EUROPE; yet the
spirit of moderation has, as yet, made too slow ad∣vances
to be intirely trusted, The conduct of the
SAXON family, where the same person can be a Ca∣tholic
King and a Protestant Elector, is, perhaps, the
first instance, in modern times, of so reasonable and
prudent a behaviour. And the gradual progress of
the Catholic superstition does, even there, prognos∣ticate
a speedy alteration: After which, 'tis justly to
be apprehended, that persecutions will put a speedy
period to the Protestant religion in the place of its
nativity.</P>
<P>THUS, upon the whole, the advantages of the
settlement in the family of STUART, which free us
<PB N="352" REF="357"/>
from a disputed title, seem to bear some proportion
with those of the settlement in the family of HANO∣VER,
which frees us from the claims of prerogative:
But at the same time, its disadvantages, by placing on
the throne a Roman Catholic, are much greater than
those of the other establishment, in settling the crown
on a foreign prince. What party an impartial patri∣ot,
in the reign of K. WILLIAM or Q. ANNE, would
have chosen amidst these opposite views, may, perhaps,
to some appear hard to determine. For my part, I
esteem liberty so invaluable a blessing in society, that
whatever favours its progress and security, can scarce
be too fondly cherished by every one who is a lover of
human kind.</P>
<P>BUT the settlement in the house of HANOVER
has actually taken place. The princes of that family,
without intrigue, without cabal, without solicitation
on their part, have been called to mount our throne,
by the united voice of the whole legislative body.
They have, since their accession, displayed, in all
their actions, the utmost mildness, equity, and regard
to the laws and constitution. Our own ministers, our
own parliaments, ourselves have governed us; and if
aught ill has befallen us, we can only blame fortune
or ourselves. What a reproach must we become
among nations, if, disgusted with a settlement so deli∣berately
made, and whose conditions have been so re∣ligiously
observed, we should throw every thing again
<PB N="353" REF="358"/>
into confusion; and by our levity and rebellious dis∣position,
prove ourselves totally unfit for any state but
that of absolute slavery and subjection?</P>
<P>THE greatest inconvenience attending a disputed
title, is, that it brings us in danger of civil wars and
rebellions. What wise man, to avoid this incon∣venience,
would run directly upon a civil war and re∣bellion?
Not to mention, that so long possession,
secured by so many laws, must, ere this time, in the
apprehension of a great part of the nation, have begot
a title in the house of HANOVER, independent of
their present possession: So that now we should not,
even by a revolution, obtain the end of avoiding a
disputed title.</P>
<P>NO revolution made by national forces, will ever be
able, without some other great necessity, to abolish
our debts and incumbrances, in which the interest of
so many persons is concerned. And a revolution
made by foreign forces, is a conquest: A calamity
with which the precarious balance of power very
nearly threatens us, and which our civil dissensions
are likely, above all other circumstances, to bring
suddenly upon us.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY XVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">IDEA OF A PERFECT COMMONWEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>OF all mankind, there are none so pernicious as
political projectors, if they have power; nor so
ridiculous, if they want it: As on the other hand, a
wise politician is the most beneficial character in na∣ture,
if accompanied with authority; and the most
innocent, and not altogether useless, even if deprived
of it. 'Tis not with forms of government, as with
other artificial contrivances; where an old engine
may be rejected, if we can discover another more ac∣curate
and commodious, or where trials may safely
be made, even tho' the success be doubtful. An
established government has an infinite advantage, by
that very circumstance of its being established; the
bulk of mankind being governed by authority, not
reason, and never attributing authority to any thing
that has not the recommendation of antiquity. To
tamper, therefore, in this affair, or try projects merely
upon the credit of supposed argument and philosophy,
<PB N="356" REF="360"/>
can never be the part of a wise magistrate, who will
bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age;
and tho' he may attempt some improvement for the
public good, yet will he adjust his innovations, as
much as possible, to the antient fabric, and preserve
intire the chief pillars and supports of the consti∣tution.</P>
<P>THE mathematicians in EUROPE have been much
divided concerning that figure of a ship, which is the
most commodious for sailing; and HUYGENS, who
at last determined this controversy, is justly thought
to have obliged the learned, as well as commercial
world; tho' COLUMBUS had sailed to AMERICA,
and Sir FRANCIS DRAKE made the tour of the world,
without any such discovery. As one form of govern∣ment
must be allowed more perfect than another, in∣dependent
of the manners and humours of particular
men; why may we not inquire what is the most per∣fect
of all, tho' the common botched and inaccurate
governments seem to serve the purposes of society,
and tho' it be not so easy to establish a new govern∣ment,
as to build a vessel upon a new plan? The
subject is surely the most worthy curiosity of any the
wit of man can possibly devise. And who knows, if
this controversy were fixed by the universal consent of
the learned, but, in some future age, an opportunity
might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice,
either by a dissolution of the old governments, or the
<PB N="357" REF="361"/>
combination of men to form a new one, in some dis∣tant
part of the world? In all cases, it must be ad∣vantageous
to know what is most perfect in the
kind, that we may be able to bring any real constitu∣tion
or form of government as near it as possible, by
such gentle alterations and innovations as may not
give too great disturbance to society.</P>
<P>ALL I pretend to in the present essay is to revive
this subject of speculation; and therefore I shall deli∣ver
my sentiments in as few words as possible. A
long dissertation on that head would not, I appre∣hend,
be very acceptable to the public, who will be
apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chi∣merical.</P>
<P>ALL plans of government, which suppose great re∣formation
in the manners of mankind, are plainly ima∣ginary.
Of this nature, are the <HI>Republic</HI> of PLATO,
and the <HI>Utopia</HI> of Sir THOMAS MORE. The OCEANA
is the only valuable model of a commonwealth, that
has as yet been offered to the public.</P>
<P>THE chief defects of the OCEANA seem to be these.
<HI>First,</HI> Its rotation is inconvenient, by throwing men,
of whatever ability, by intervals, out of public em∣ployments.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Its <HI>Agrarian</HI> is impracticable.
Men will soon learn the art, which was practised in
antient ROME, of concealing their possessions under
<PB N="358" REF="362"/>
other people's names; till at last, the abuse will be∣come
so common, that they will throw off even the
appearance of restraint. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The OCEANA pro∣vides
not a sufficient security for liberty, or the redress
of grievances. The senate must propose, and the
people consent; by which means, the senate have not
only a negative upon the people, but, what is of infi∣nitely
greater consequence, their negative goes before
the votes of the people. Were the King's negative
of the same nature in the ENGLISH constitution, and
could he prevent any bill from coming into parlia∣ment,
he would be an absolute monarch. As his ne∣gative
follows the votes of the houses, it is of little
consequence: Such a difference is there in the man∣ner
of placing the same thing. When a popular bill
has been debated in the two houses, is brought to
maturity, all its conveniencies and inconveniencies
weighed and balanced; if afterwards it be presented
for the royal assent, few princes will venture to reject
the unanimous desire of the people. But could the
King crush a disagreeable bill in embryo (as was the
case for some time, in the SCOTCH parliament, by
means of the lords of the articles) the BRITISH go∣vernment
would have no balance, nor would grie∣vances
ever be redressed: And 'tis certain, that exor∣bitant
power proceeds not, in any government, from
new laws, so much as from neglecting to remedy the
abuses which frequently rise from the old ones. A
government, says MACHIAVEL, must often be brought
<PB N="359" REF="363"/>
back to its original principles. It appears then, that
in the OCEANA the whole legislature may be said to
rest in the senate; which HARRINGTON would own
to be an inconvenient form of government, especially
after the <HI>Agrarian</HI> is abolished.</P>
<P>HERE is a form of government, to which I cannot,
in theory, discover any considerable objection.</P>
<P>LET GREAT BRITAIN and IRELAND, or any ter∣ritory
of equal extent, be divided into 100 counties,
and each county into 100 parishes, making in all
10,000. If the country purposed to be erected into a
commonwealth, be of more narrow extent, we may
diminish the number of counties; but never bring
them below thirty. If it be of greater extent, 'twere
better to enlarge the parishes, or throw more parishes
into a county, than increase the number of counties.</P>
<P>LET all the free-holders of ten pounds a-year in
the country, and all the house-holders worth 200
pounds in the town-parishes, meet annually in the
parish-church, and chuse, by ballot, some freeholder of
the county for their member, whom we shall call the
county <HI>representative.</HI></P>
<P>LET the 100 county representatives, two days after
their election, meet in the county-town, and chuse by
ballot, from their own body, ten county <HI>magistrates,</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="364"/>
and one <HI>senator.</HI> There are, therefore, in the whole
commonwealth, 100 senators, 1100 county magis∣trates,
and 10,000 county representatives. For we
shall bestow on all senators the authority of county
magistrates, and on all county magistrates the autho∣rity
of county representatives.</P>
<P>LET the senators meet in the capital, and be en∣dowed
with the whole executive power of the com∣monwealth;
the power of peace and war, of giving
orders to generals, admirals, and ambassadors, and, in
short, all the prerogatives of a BRITISH King, ex∣cept
his negative.</P>
<P>LET the county representatives meet in their parti∣cular
counties, and possess the whole legislative power
of the commonwealth; the greatest number of coun∣ties
deciding the question; and where these are equal,
let the senate have the casting vote.</P>
<P>EVERY new law must first be debated in the se∣nate;
and tho' rejected by it, if ten senators insist and
protest, it must be sent down to the counties. The
senate may join to the copy of the law, their reasons
for receiving or rejecting it.</P>
<P>BECAUSE it would be troublesome to assemble the
whole county representatives for every trivial law,
that may be requisite, the senate have their choice of
<PB N="361" REF="365"/>
sending down the law either to the county magistrates
or county representatives.</P>
<P>THE magistrates, tho' the law be referred to them,
may, if they please, call the representatives, and sub∣mit
the affair to their determination.</P>
<P>WHETHER the law be referred by the senate to the
county magistrates or representatives, a copy of it,
and of the senate's reasons, must be sent to every re∣presentative
eight days before the day appointed for
the assembling, in order to deliberate concerning it.
And tho' the determination be, by the senate, refer∣red
to the magistrates, if five representatives of the
county order the magistrates to assemble the whole
court of representatives, and submit the affair to their
determination, they must obey.</P>
<P>EITHER the county magistrates or representatives
may give, to the senator of the county, the copy of
a law to be proposed to the senate; and if five coun∣ties
concur in the same order, the law, tho' refused
by the senate, must come either to the county magi∣strates
or representatives, as is contained in the order
of the five counties.</P>
<P>ANY twenty counties, by a vote either of their ma∣gistrates
or representatives, may throw any man out
<PB N="362" REF="366"/>
of all public offices for a year. Thirty counties for
three years.</P>
<P>THE senate has a power of throwing out any mem∣ber
or number of members of its own body, not to
be re-elected for that year. The senate cannot throw
out twice in a year the senator of the same county.</P>
<P>THE power of the old senate continues for three
weeks after the annual election of the county repre∣sentatives.
Then all the new senators are shut up in
a conclave, like the cardinals; and by an intricate
ballot, such as that of VENICE or MALTA, they
chuse the following magistrates; a protector, who re∣presents
the dignity of the commonwealth, and pre∣sides
in the senate; two secretaries of state; these six
councils, a council of state, a council of religion and
learning, a council of trade, a council of laws, a
council of war, a council of the admiralty, each
council consisting of five persons; together with six
commissioners of the treasury and a first commissioner.
All these must be senators. The senate also names
all the ambassadors to foreign courts, who may either
be senators or not.</P>
<P>THE senate may continue any or all of these, but
must re-elect them every year.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="367"/>
THE protector and two secretaries have session and
suffrage in the council of state. The business of that
council is all foreign politics. The council of state
has session and suffrage in all the other councils.</P>
<P>THE council of religion and learning inspects the
universities and clergy. That of trade inspects every
thing that may affect commerce. That of laws in∣spects
all the abuses of laws by the inferior magi∣strates,
and examines what improvements may be
made of the municipal law. That of war inspects
the militia and its discipline, magazines, stores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and when the republic is in war, examines into the
proper orders for generals. The council of admi∣ralty
has the same power with regard to the navy, to∣gether
with the nomination of the captains and all
inferior officers.</P>
<P>NONE of these councils can give orders themselves,
except where they receive such powers from the senate.
In other cases, they must communicate every thing
to the senate.</P>
<P>WHEN the senate is under adjournment, any of
the councils may assemble it before the day appointed
for its meeting.</P>
<P>BESIDES these councils or courts, there is another
called the court of <HI>competitors;</HI> which is thus consti∣tuted.
<PB N="364" REF="368"/>
If any candidates for the office of senator have
have more votes than a third of the representatives,
that candidate, who has most votes, next to the se∣nator
elected, becomes incapable for one year of all
public offices, even of being a magistrate or represen∣tative:
But he takes his seat in the court of com∣petitors.
Here then is a court which may sometimes
consist of a hundred members, sometimes have no
members at all; and by that means, be for a year
abolished.</P>
<P>THE court of competitors has no power in the
commonwealth. It has only the inspection of public
accounts, and the accusing any man before the senate.
If the senate acquit him, the court of competitors
may, if they please, appeal to the people, either ma∣gistrates
or representatives. Upon that appeal, the
magistrates or representatives meet on the day ap∣pointed
by the court of competitors, and chuse in
each county three persons; from which number every
senator is excluded. These to the number of 300
meet in the capital, and bring the person accused to
a new trial.</P>
<P>THE court of competitors may propose any law to
the senate; and if refused, may appeal to the people;
that is, to the magistrates or representatives, who ex∣amine
it in their counties. Every senator, who is
<PB N="365" REF="369"/>
thrown out of the senate by a vote of the court, takes
his seat in the court of competitors.</P>
<P>THE senate possesses all the judicative authority of
the house of Lords, that is, all the appeals from the
inferior courts. It likewise nominates the Lord Chan∣cellor,
and all the officers of the law.</P>
<P>EVERY county is a kind of republic within itself,
and the representatives may make county-laws; which
have no authority 'till three months after they are
voted. A copy of the law is sent to the senate, and
to every other county. The senate, or any single
county, may, at any time, annul any law of another
county.</P>
<P>THE representatives have all the authority of the
BRITISH justices of peace in trials, commitments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE magistrates have the nomination of all the
officers of the revenue in each county. All causes
with regard to the revenue are appealed ultimately to
the magistrates. They pass the accompts of all the
officers; but must have all their own accompts ex∣amined
and passed at the end of the year by the re∣presentatives.</P>
<P>THE magistrates name rectors or ministers to all
the parishes.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="370"/>
THE Presbyterian government is established; and
the highest ecclesiastical court is an assembly or synod
of all the presbyters of the county. The magistrates
may take any cause from this court, and determine
it themselves.</P>
<P>THE magistrates may try, and depose or suspend
any presbyter.</P>
<P>THE militia is established in imitation of that in
SWISSERLAND, which being well known, we shall
not insist upon it. It will only be proper to make
this addition, that an army of 20,000 men be an∣nually
drawn out by rotation, paid and encamped
during six weeks in summer; that the duty of a camp
may not be altogether unknown.</P>
<P>THE magistrates nominate all the colonels and
downwards. The senate all upwards. During war,
the general nominates the colonel and downwards,
and his commission is good for a twelvemonth. But
after that it must be confirmed by the magistrates of
the county to which the regiment belongs. The ma∣gistrates
may break any officer in the county regiment.
And the senate may do the same to any officer in the
service. If the magistrates do not think proper to
confirm the general's choice, they may nominate ano∣ther
officer in the place of him they reject.</P>
<P><PB N="369" REF="371"/>
TEN thousand, even tho' they were not annually
elected, are a large enough basis for any free govern∣ment.
'Tis true, the nobles in POLAND are more
than 10,000, and yet these oppress the people. But
as power continues there always in the same persons
and families, this makes them, in a manner, a diffe∣rent
nation from the people. Besides, the nobles are
there united under a few heads of families.</P>
<P>ALL free governments must consist of two councils,
a less and a greater, or, in other words, of a senate
and people. The people, as HARRINGTON observes,
would want wisdom, without the senate: The senate,
without the people, would want honesty.</P>
<P>A LARGE assembly of 1000, for instance, to repre∣sent
the people, if allowed to debate, would fall into
disorder. If not allowed to debate, the senate has a
negative upon them, and the worst kind of negative,
that before resolution.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is an inconvenience, which no go∣vernment
has yet fully remedied, but which is the
easiest to be remedied in the world. If the people
debate, all is confusion: If they do not debate,
they can only resolve; and then the senate carves for
them. Divide the people into many separate bodies;
and then they may debate with safety, and every in∣convenience
seems to be prevented.</P>

CARDINAL de RETZ says, that all numerous as∣semblies,
however composed, are mere mob, and
swayed in their debates by the least motive. This
we find confirmed by daily experience. When an
absurdity strikes a member, he conveys it to his neigh∣bour,
and so on, till the whole be infected. Separate
this great body; and tho' every member be only of
middling sense, 'tis not probable, that any thing but
reason can prevail over the whole. Influence and
example being removed, good sense will always get
the better of bad among a number of people. Good
sense is one thing: But follies are numberless; and
every man has a different one. The only way of
making a people wise, is to keep them from uniting
into large assemblies.</P>
<P>THERE are two things to be guarded against in
every <HI>senote:</HI> Its combination, and its division. Its
combination is most dangerous. And against this in∣convenience
we have provided the following remedies.
1. The great dependence of the senators on the
people by annual elections; and that not by an un∣distinguishing
rabble, like the ENGLISH electors, but
by men of fortune and education. 2. The small
power they are allowed. They have few offices <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o
dispose of. Almost all are given by the magistrates
in the counties. 3. The court of competitors, which
being composed of men that are their rivals, next to</P>
<P><PB N="367" REF="375"/>
ALL crimes are tryed within the county by the ma∣gistrates
and a jury. But the senate can stop any trial,
and bring it before themselves.</P>
<P>ANY county may indict any man before the senate,
for any crime.</P>
<P>THE protector, the two secretaries, the council of
state, with any five more that the senate appoints; on
extraordinary emergencies, are possessed of <HI>dictatorial</HI>
power for six months.</P>
<P>THE protector may pardon any person condemned
by the inferior courts.</P>
<P>IN time of war, no officer of the army that is in
the field, can have any civil office in the common∣wealth.</P>
<P>THE capital, which we shall call LONDON, may
be allowed four members in the senate. It may
therefore be divided into four counties. The repre∣sentatives
of each of these chuse one senator, and ten
magistrates. There are therefore in the city four se∣nators,
forty-four magistrates, and four hundred re∣presentatives.
The magistrates have the same autho∣rity
as in the counties. The representatives also have
the same authority; but they never meet in one ge∣neral
court: They give their votes in their particular
county, or division of hundreds.</P>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<P><PB N="368" REF="376"/>
WHEN they enact any city-law, the greatest num∣ber
of counties or divisions determines the matter.
And where these are equal, the magistrates have the
casting vote.</P>
<P>THE magistrates chuse the mayor, sheriff, recorder,
and other officers of the city.</P>
<P>IN the commonwealth, no representative, magi∣strate,
or senator, as such, has any salary. The pro∣tector,
secretaries, councils, and ambassadors, have
salaries.</P>
<P>THE first year in every century is set apart to cor∣rect
all inequalities, which time may have produced
in the representative. This must be done by the le∣gislature.</P>
<P>THE following political aphorisms may explain the
reason of these orders.</P>
<P>THE lower sort of people and small proprietors
are good enough judges of one not very distant from
them in rank or habitation; and therefore, in their
parochial meetings, will probably chuse the best, or
nearly the best representative: But they are wholly
unfit for county-meetings, and for electing into the
higher offices of the republic. Their ignorance gives
the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="377"/>
BUT lest that should not be enough, their depen∣dence
on the 10,000 for their elections, serves to the
same purpose.</P>
<P>NOR is that all: For the 10,000 may resume the
power, whenever they please; and not only when
they all please, but when any five of a hundred please,
which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a
separate interest.</P>
<P>THE 10,000 are too large a body either to unite
or divide, except when they meet in one place, and
fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders. Not to
mention their annual election, by almost the whole
body of the people.</P>
<P>A SMALL commonwealth is the happiest govern∣ment
in the world within itself; because every thing
lies under the eye of the rulers: But it may be sub∣dued
by great force from without. This scheme
seems to have all the advantages both of a great and
a little commonwealth.</P>
<P>EVERY county-law may be annulled either by the
senate or another county; because that shows an op∣position
of interest: In which case no part ought to
decide for itself. The matter must be referred to
the whole, which will best determine what agrees
with general interest.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="378"/>
AS to the clergy and militia, the reasons of these
orders are obvious. Without the dependence of the
clergy on the civil magistrate, and without a militia,
'tis folly to think any free government will ever have
security or stability.</P>
<P>IN many governments, the inferior magistrates have
no rewards but what arise from their ambition, va∣nity,
or public spirit. The salaries of the FRENCH
judges amount not to the interest of the sums they
pay for their offices. The DUTCH burgo-masters
have little more immediate profit than the ENGLISH
justices of peace, or the members of the house of
commons formerly. But lest any should suspect, that
this would beget negligence in the administration,
(which is little to be feared, confidering the natural
ambition of mankind) let the magistrates have com∣petent
salaries. The senators have access to so many
honourable and lucrative offices, that their attendance
needs not be bought. There is little attendance re∣quired
of the representatives.</P>
<P>THAT the foregoing plan of government is prac∣ticable,
no one can doubt, who considers the resem∣blance
it bears to the commonwealth of the United
Provinces, formerly one of the wisest and most re∣nowned
governments that ever was in the world.
The alterations in the present scheme are all evidently
to the better. 1. The representation is more equal.
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<PB N="371" REF="379"/>
them in interest, and uneasy in their present siuation
will be sure to take all advantages against them.</P>
<P>THE division of the senate is prevented, 1. By
the smallness of their number. 2. As faction sup∣poses
a combination to a separate interest, it is pre∣vented
by their dependence on the people. 3. They
have a power of expelling any factious member. 'Tis
true, when another member of the same spirit comes
from the county, they have no power of expelling
him: Nor is it fit they should; for that shows the
humour to be in the people, and probably arises from
some ill conduct in public affairs. 4. Almost any
man, in a senate so regularly chosen by the people,
may be supposed fit for any civil office. 'Twould be
proper, therefore, for the senate to form some <HI>general</HI>
resolutions with regard to the disposing of offices
among the members: Which resolutions would not
confine them in critical times, when extraordinary
parts on the one hand, or extraordinary stupidity on
the other, appears in any senator; but yet they would
be sufficient to prevent brigue and faction, by mak∣ing
the disposal of the offices a thing of course. For
instance, let it be a resolution, That no man shall
enjoy any office, till he has sat four years in the se∣nate:
That, except ambassadors, no man shall be in
office two years following: That no man shall attain
the higher offices but thro' the lower: That no man
<PB N="372" REF="380"/>
shall be protector twice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The senate of VENICE
govern themselves by such resolutions.</P>
<P>IN foreign politics the interest of the senate can
scarce ever be divided from that of the people; and
therefore 'tis fit to make the senate absolute with regard
to them; otherwise there could be no secrecy nor re∣fined
policy. Besides, without money no alliance can
be executed; and the senate is still sufficiently depen∣dant.
Not to mention, that the legislative power
being always superior to the executive, the magi∣strates
or representatives may interpose, whenever
they think proper.</P>
<P>THE chief support of the BRITISH government is
the opposition of interests; but that, tho' in the main
serviceable, breeds endless factions. In the foregoing
plan, it does all the good without any of the harm.
The <HI>competitors</HI> have no power of controlling the se∣nate:
They have only the power of accusing, and
appealing to the people.</P>
<P>'TIS necessary, likewise, to prevent both combina∣tion
and division in the thousand magistrates. This
is done sufficiently by the separation of places and
interests.</P>
<GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<P><PB N="375" REF="381"/>
2. The unlimited power of the burgo-masters in the
towns, which forms a perfect aristocracy in the DUTCH
commonwealth, is corrected by a well-tempered de∣mocracy,
in giving to the people the annual election
of the county-representatives. 3. The negative, which
every province and town has upon the whole body of
the DUTCH republic, with regard to alliances, peace
and war, and the imposition of taxes, is here removed.
4. The counties, in the present plan, are not so inde∣pendent
of each other, nor do they form separate bo∣dies
so much as the seven provinces; where the jea∣lousy
and envy of the smaller provinces and towns
against the greater, particularly HOLLAND and AM∣STERDAM,
have frequently disturbed the government.
5. Larger powers, tho' of the safest kind, are in∣trusted
to the senate than the States-General possess;
by which means, the former may become more
expeditious, and secret in their resolutions, than 'tis
possible for the latter.</P>
<P>THE chief alterations that could be made on the
BRITISH government, in order to bring it to the
most perfect model of limited monarchy, seem to be
the following. <HI>First,</HI> The plan of the republican
parliament ought to be restored, by making the re∣presentation
equal, and by allowing none to vote in
the county-elections who possess not a property of 200
pounds value. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As such a house of Com∣mons
would be too weighty for a frail house of Lords,
<PB N="376" REF="382"/>
like the present, the Bishops and SCOTCH Peers ought
to be removed, whose behaviour, <HI>in former parlia∣ments,</HI>
destroyed entirely the authority of that house:
The number of the upper house ought to be raised to
three or four hundred: Their seats not hereditary, but
during life: They ought to have the election of their
own members; and no commoner should be allowed
to refuse a seat that was offered him. By this means,
the house of Lords would consist entirely of the men
of chief credit, ability, and interest of the nation;
and every turbulent leader in the house of Commons
might be taken off, and connected in interest with
the house of Peers. Such an aristocracy would be an
excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it.
At present, the balance of our government depends
in some measure on the ability and behaviour of the
sovereign; which are variable and uncertain circum∣stances.</P>
<P>I ALLOW, that this plan of limited monarchy, how∣ever
corrected, is still liable to three great inconveni∣encies.
<HI>First,</HI> It removes not entirely, tho' it may
soften, the parties of <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country. Secondly,</HI> The
King's personal character must still have a great influ∣ence
on the government. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The sword is in
the hands of a single person, who will always neglect
to discipline the militia, in order to have a pretext
for keeping up a standing army. 'Tis evident, that
this is a mortal distemper in the BRITISH govern∣ment,
<PB N="377" REF="383"/>
of which it must at last inevitably perish. I
must, however, confess, that SWEDEN seems, in
some measure, to have remedied this inconvenience,
and to have a militia, with its limited monarchy, as
well as a standing army, which is less dangerous than
the BRITISH.</P>
<P>WE shall conclude this subject, with observing the
falsehood of the common opinion, that no large state,
such as FRANCE or BRITAIN, could ever be modelled
into a commonwealth, but that such a form of go∣vernment
can only take place in a city or small ter∣ritory.
The contrary seems evident. Tho' 'tis more
difficult to form a republican government in an ex∣tensive
country than in a city; there is more facility,
when once it is formed, of preserving it steady and
uniform, without tumult and faction. 'Tis not easy,
for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any
plan of free government; but they easily conspire in
the esteem and reverence for a single person, who,
by means of this popular favour, may seize the
power, and forcing the more obstinate to submit,
may establish a monarchical government. On the
other hand, a city readily concurs in the same notions
of government, the natural equality of property fa∣vours
liberty, and the nearness of habitation enables
the citizens mutually to assist each other. Even un∣der
absolute princes, the subordinate government of
cities is commonly republican; while that of coun∣ties
<PB N="378" REF="384"/>
and provinces is monarchical. But these same cir∣cumstances,
which facilitate the erection of common∣wealths
in cities, render their constitution more frail
and uncertain. Democracies are turbulent. For
however the people may be separated or divided into
small parties, either in their votes or elections; their
near habitation in a city will always make the force
of popular tides and currents very sensible. Aristo∣cracies
are better adapted for peace and order, and
accordingly were most admired by antient writers;
but they are jealous and oppressive. In a large go∣vernment,
which is modelled with masterly skill, there
is compass and room enough to refine the democracy,
from the lower people, who may be admitted into
the first elections or first concoction of the common∣wealth,
to the higher magistrates, who direct all the
movements. At the same time, the parts are so dis∣tant
and remote, that 'tis very difficult, either by in∣trigue,
prejudice, or passion, to hurry them into any
measures against the public interest.</P>
<P>'TIS needless to inquire, whether such a govern∣ment
would be immortal. I allow the justness of the
poet's exclamation on the endless project, of human
race, <HI>Man and for ever!</HI> The world itself probably
is not immortal. Such consuming plagues may arise
as would leave even a perfect government a weak
prey to its neighbours. We know not to what lengths
<PB N="379" REF="385"/>
enthusiasm, or other extraordinary motions of the
human mind, may transport men, to the neglect of
all order and public good. Where difference of in∣terest
is removed, whimsical and unaccountable fac∣tions
often arise, from personal favour or enmity.
Perhaps rust may grow to the springs of the most
accurate political machine, and disorder its motions.
Lastly, extensive conquests, when pursued, must be
the ruin of every free government; and of the more
perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect;
because of the very advantages which the former pos∣sess
above the latter. And tho' such a state ought to
establish a fundamental law against conquests; yet re∣publics
have ambition as well as individuals, and pre∣sent
interest makes men forgetful of their posterity.
'Tis a sufficient incitement to human endeavours, that
such a government would flourish for many ages;
without pretending to bestow on any work of man,
that immortality, which the Almighty seems to have
refused to his own productions.</P>
