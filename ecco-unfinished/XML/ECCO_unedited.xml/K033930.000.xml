<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WITH the greatest Humility and Submission, I solicit your Pardon for throwing my poetical Brat at your Lordship's Door. If my Presumption offend, I am truly sorry for my Fault; but, by Way of Excuse, must beg Leave to add, that no less illustrious a Personage, than the Earl of <HI>Granville,</HI> is partly accessary to the Crime: Had not your Lordship taken such uncommon Pains to distinguish your Benevolence to Man∣kind, and that inviolable Attachment to the BRITISH Constitu∣tion,
<PB REF="3"/>which is so eminently display'd in your truly-patriot Spirit; had not your Lordship so strenuously exerted those shining Abi∣lities, with which Nature hath blessed you, in the Preservation of the Liberties of your Fellow-Subjects, and so indefatigably en∣deavoured to <HI>restore</HI> the Glory of the BRITISH Name, I should not have singled out your Lordship for a Patron to this <HI>Philippic.</HI> Believe me, my Lord, when I assure you, if I had known <HI>one</HI> BRITON, to whom I could have <HI>more properly</HI> inscribed the following Piece, that I should not have troubled your Lordship with the present Address.
