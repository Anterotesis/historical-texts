<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A GENEROUS concern for the welfare of his country, and an earnest attention to alleviate private distress, were the virtues which chiefly recom∣mended Mr. Hanway to your Lordship's esteem. To these virtues, possessed in a most eminent degree by your Lordship, are added (happily for mankind) a splen∣dour of rank, and affluence of fortune, which save your Lordship the sorrow his confined fortune often made him feel
<PB N="ii" REF="4"/>
at the fight of misery which he could not relieve.</P>
<P>The loyalty of your ancestors, shewn in the most dangerous and perturbed times; their zeal for the cause of true religion, and their profound learning, are reflected back by your Lordship with an increase of splendour: but as these distinguished qualities did not prevent you from respecting him, who possessed no eminent degree of learning, and whose loyalty and love of virtue were confined to a narrow sphere, whilst he was living; I trust that this feeble at∣tempt to delineate his character, now he is no more, will not be received by your Lordship with displeasure.</P>
<P>Far, very far, distant may the time be when some more able pen shall endea∣vour
<PB N="iii" REF="5"/>
to perpetuate to mankind the re∣membrance of your Lordship's virtues, and extend their influence even beyond the limits of life.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I SUBMIT the following sheets to the inspection of the public with all be∣coming deference. They are the pro∣duce of a few hours, which I have been able to spare, in broken and detached portions, from necessary business; and partake, I fear, very sufficiently of the distraction of thought, which such a mode of composition always occasions in some degree. But whatever may be their reception with the world, they
<PB N="vi" REF="7"/>
have had the effect on my own mind to alleviate the sorrow which I felt at the loss of a most valuable patron and friend, under whose roof I resided from my early youth, and by whose counsel I have escaped many of the dangers to which youth is exposed.</P>
<P>I have met with no greater difficulties in this work than I suppose usually oc∣cur to every one who makes a first at∣tempt of this kind: The most trouble-some have been occasioned by the least material parts, such as the ascertaining of dates. It is of very little conse∣quence to the world, which will rever∣ence Mr. Hanway only for his own per∣sonal conduct, whether he was the ne∣phew or the grandson of Sir Jonas Moore; whether he was born on the second or on
<PB N="vii" REF="8"/>
the twelfth of August, or whether his father was a store-keeper, or an agent victualler; yet it was expected that these circumstances should be mentioned, and certificates, which I have always taken for my guide, where they were attain∣able, were sometimes not easily to be procured.</P>
<P>One difficulty, peculiar to my station in life, and which may not be perceived by the reader, was to divest myself of the style of the profession I was bred to; which, though well calculated to ex∣press legal certainty, would not suit a work of this kind.</P>
<P>With respect to the account I have given of the many charitable institutions, in the establishment or promotion of
<PB N="viii" REF="9"/>
which Mr. Hanway was engaged, I have endeavoured as much as possible to make it faithful and correct. It may possibly be in the power of the secretaries of some of them to correct me in several instances relating to their own peculiar object: yet I flatter myself it would be difficult for an individual to give an account of them all collectively, which might be depended on with more safety than that to be found in this work.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway's life, particularly the latter years of it, was a course of such noble and benevolent actions, that it de∣served to be transmitted to posterity by the most elegant pen; but I believe no person possessed so many materials for the work as myself, and I have, with,
<PB N="ix" REF="10"/>
perhaps, too much self complacency, concluded that this would compensate for the want of adequate abilities.</P>
<P>I cannot leave the reader to the peru∣sal of the work, without first expressing the obligation I am under to Mr. George Peters, governor of the Bank, for the readiness with which he has been pleased to communicate to me many circum∣stances in the life of his respected friend, which I could have learned from no other person.</P>
<P>I am likewise indebted to Mr. Henry Busby, for several useful pieces of infor∣mation: Indeed, whatever pleasure or in∣struction the reader may derive from the performance, will be owing to the last gentleman, who perused the copy whilst
<PB N="x" REF="11"/>
it was in manuscript, and by whose ad∣vice it is published; for it was begun without any intention of being printed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART I.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THE life of a man eminent for disinterestedness in his own private concerns, and an unremitted attention to the welfare and happiness of others; who devoted his time, his labour, and his for∣tune to the service of his fellow crea∣tures, and made universal philanthropy the
<PB N="2" REF="13"/>
ruling principle of his action, cannot but be acceptable to all; because it holds up, for imitation, an example of virtues, which all esteem, and which all may attain if they resolve to take the means.</P>
<P>But Mr. Hanway's life was not confined merely to a round of actions, which, though excellent in themselves, are perhaps not the most interesting in the recital: Some years of the early part of it were spent in a coun∣try but imperfectly known to the English before his time: Persia, when he was there, was the theatre of the most remarkable trans∣actions; and the contemplative reader will not fail to compare in his mind the events of the present age, with those of the times of Cyrus and Darius, and feel an additional motive to revere that Providence in whose hand is the fate of mighty empires.</P>
<P>JONAS HANWAY, Esq. was born at Portsmouth, in Hampshire, on the twelfth day of August, 1712. His father, Mr.
<PB N="3" REF="14"/>
Thomas Hanway, was an officer in the naval line, and for some years store-keeper to the dock-yard at Portsmouth. He was depriv∣ed of his life by an accident, and left his widow with four children, Jonas, William, Thomas, and Elizabeth, all of a very tender age.</P>
<P>Mrs. Hanway, thus deprived of her pro∣tector and support, and left to rear up a young family by her own exertions, remov∣ed with her children to London; and such was her maternal care and affection for them, that Mr. Hanway never spoke or wrote of his mother, but in terms of the highest reverence and gratitude.</P>
<P>William, in the early part of his life, had an appointment in the Navy-office. Thomas, pursuing his father's profession, in 1742 ob∣tained a captain's commission, and distin∣guished himself in some engagements on the coast of Scotland in 1745, and in the two prin∣cipal engagements of the succeeding war with France and Spain. He married the beauti∣ful
<PB N="4" REF="15"/>
Miss Ann Howe, of a very respectable family in the north of England. In 1756, he was appointed commander in chief of his Majesty's ships at Plymouth, and in 1761 commissioner of the dock-yard at Chatham, which post he retained till 1771, when finding his health to decline, he resigned his trust, and came with his lady to his brother Jonas's house in Red-Lion-Square, where he died the next year, leaving his widow, beautiful even at the age of sixty, behind him. She died about eight years after her husband of the small-pox. Elizabeth was married, first to Captain Worledge, and, after his death, to Mr. Townsend, and died in 1770.</P>
<P>Of Mr. Hanway's ancestors there is but little remarkable: They were of moderate fortune, respectable professions, and fair character. His uncle, by the father's side, Major John Hanway, was a man of wit and gallantry: He translated several of the odes, satires, and epistles of Horace, and
<PB N="5" REF="16"/>
the works of other Latin poets; and was the author of some original verses in that language.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>His talent for translation and composition, may be judged of by the following specimens, taken from his book, dedicated to Thomas Viscount Windsor, of which I have seen but one copy.</P>

seventeen he went over to Lisbon, where he arrived in June, 1729, and was bound ap∣prentice to a merchant in that city.</P>
<P>His early life was marked with that dis∣creet attention to business, and love of neatness and regularity, which distinguished his future character. At Lisbon his affec∣tions were captivated by a lady, then cele∣brated for her beauty and mental accom∣plishments; but she preferring another for her husband, returned to England, and spent the latter part of her life in London with her family, on terms of friendship with Mr. Hanway.</P>
<P>On the expiration of Mr. Hanway's ap∣prenticeship, he entered into business at Lisbon as a merchant or factor; but did not remain there long before he returned to London. From the time of his arrival in London, to the year 1743, when he went over with intention to settle at St. Peters∣burgh, nothing remarkable happened. He
<PB N="8" REF="19"/>
was not indeed in this period, nor in any other part of his long life, inactive: As commerce was his profession, he pursued it with an arduous and indefatigable atten∣tion, and the strictest regard to honour and integrity; but in 1743, he entered into an engagement which totally changed the course of his life; and was attended with occur∣rences truly remarkable. He had hitherto appeared only in the familiar light of a merchant; but we are now to view him in a new situation and a new character: to see with what perseverance and address he con∣ducts himself amidst dangers and difficulties, not only new to himself, but such as fall to the lot of very few to encounter.</P>
<P>It is at this period that his "Travels" commence; and I flatter myself the relation of this part of his life will be particularly acceptable, even to those who were not ac∣quainted with him. These Travels, although they went through four editions, have been
<PB N="9" REF="20"/>
long out of print. It has been in contem∣plation to reprint them; but the worn out condition of the plates, and the expence of two large quarto volumes, have been formi∣dable obstacles. I shall therefore endeavour to give a plain narrative of the most material occurrences, omitting those parts of the work which do not immediately relate to himself; and as the scene of these transac∣tions was principally on the Caspian Sea, and the borders thereof, a chart is annexed of that vast lake, reduced from the original chart presented to Mr. Hanway by Captain Woodrooffe, his fellow traveller, which was taken by order of Nadir Shah, the Persian monarch: And to render the relation yet more intelligible, there is traced thereon the rout from Yerkie, at the north-west end of the Caspian, to Langarood, at the opposite extremity; from thence to Astrabad, at the south-east corner, the place where his mis∣fortunes began, and from thence towards
<PB N="10" REF="21"/>
the camp of the <HI>Shah</HI>, and his return to Yerkie.</P>
<P>In February, 1743, Mr. Hanway accepted the offer of a partnership in the house of Mr. Dingley, a merchant, at St. Petersburgh; and embarking in the river Thames in the April following, he arrived at St. Peters∣burgh the tenth of June. Here he first be∣came acquainted with the Caspian trade, then in its infancy, and entertained an ardent desire to see Persia, a country so renowned for extraordinary events in ancient and modern times.</P>
<P>As the trade to Persia has been attended with circumstances somewhat remarkable, and is connected with the subject of Mr. Hanway's adventures in that country, some account of it is necessary.</P>
<P>The opening a trade through Russia into Persia, had, ever since the discovery of Archangel by the English, been considered as capable of procuring many advantages
<PB N="11" REF="22"/>
to this country; and attempts were made very early to effect it, but without any con∣siderable progress. In 1738, John Elton, an English seaman, of a most enterprising genius, and who had spent four years among the roving Tartars, who inhabit the vast and uncultivated countries which lie be∣tween Bokhara, and the western boundaries of Siberia, made a proposal to some British factors at St. Petersburgh, to introduce a trade through Russia into Persia, by way of the Caspian sea, and represented that the only tolerably safe way was down the river Volga, and along the Caspian to Astrabad, or some other port near the south-east extre∣mity of that sea, and from thence to Mes∣ched, the then favourite city of the Persian monarch; from which place he conceived it practicable to extend it to the northern cities of the Mogul's empire.</P>
<P>Mr. Elton's proposal being accepted by the factors, in the beginning of the year
<PB N="12" REF="23"/>
1739 he sat out from St. Petersburgh with a cargo of goods, and, after encountering many difficulties, arrived at Reshd, a city or principal town near the south-west extremity of the Caspian, where, finding protection from the Shah's regent, he sold his cargo at a good price, without proceeding to Mes∣ched as he originally intended; and after having obtained a decree of the regent in favour of the new trade, he returned to St. Petersburgh.</P>
<P>In 1741, an act of the British parliament passed in favour of the trade, obtained in a great measure by the representations made by Mr. Elton to the honourable Mr. Fynch, at that time his Britannick Majesty's minister at St. Petersburgh; and in 1742 Mr. Elton went again into Persia, commander of one of two ships built by the factors for the more effectually carrying into execution their plan; but actuated by ambition, or disgusted at some part of his principals' con∣duct,
<PB N="13" REF="24"/>
he deserted the cause he was engaged in, and entered into the service of the usurper Nadir Shah, as <Q>“Superintendant of ”the Persian coast of the Caspian," with de∣sign to build ships in the European manner, for the navigation of that sea.</Q></P>
<P>This desertion of the principal agent in the design gave great offence to the Russian court, and alarmed the factors so much, that they determined to send one of their com∣pany into Persia, to superintend the trade; and Mr. Hanway, on his own voluntary offer, was agreed on as the person. His known integrity and perseverance, joined to the interest he had in the trade, gave the other factors great hopes of success through his means; and they trusted their enterprise to his conduct with implicit confidence.</P>
<P>On the tenth of September, 1743, after making the necessary disposition for his journey, he sat out from St. Petersburgh, with an interpreter, who had been before
<PB N="14" REF="25"/>
in that part of Persia into which he was going, a clerk, a Russian menial servant, a Tartar boy, and a guard; having under his care a caravan of thirty-seven bales of English cloth, making twenty carriage loads, and arrived at Moscow in ten days from his departure, the distance being 734 wersts, or 487 English miles.</P>
<P><Q>“It is too much the custom in Russia for officers, or persons who travel with ser∣vants or soldiers, to treat the peasants with ”insolence;</Q> but the first charge Mr. Han∣way gave his attendants was, to avoid every occasion of dispute, and still more of op∣pression; and that if any insult was offered to them, they should inform him, that he might judge in what manner it ought to be resented.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of September, hav∣ing repaired his waggons, and provided ne∣cessaries, he left Moscow; and on the se∣venth
<PB N="15" REF="26"/>
day after, he entered the Step,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The common name in Russia for a desert.</NOTE> and arrived, October the ninth, at Zaritzen, a city on the western banks of the Volga, 688 English miles distant from Moscow. On his arrival at this place, he endeavoured to procure a vessel which should carry his caravan down the Volga to Astrachan, the metropolis of a province situate on the other side the river, within the limits of Asia, at the distance of sixty English miles from its disemboguement into the Caspian sea; and having hired a vessel of the kind in use on that river, with proper persons to navigate her, he left Zaritzen the eighth of November, and proceeded on his voyage.</P>
<P><Q>“The river Volga (anciently called the ”Rha) is," says Mr. Hanway, “for extent one of the noblest in the world: it derives its source from the lake Fernoff, in the province of Reskoff, running, according to
<PB N="16" REF="27"/>
general computation, near 3000 English miles before it empties itself into the Cas∣pian. The immense quantities of water which this river receives from others, and from many hilly countries, from whence descend great torrents, particularly when the snow melts in the Spring, are the cause of its swelling at different times and places. The sailors who navigate this river, are remarkable for their dexterity in <HI>warping</HI>. They have three boats to carry out the warps, which they take in forward, and at the same time they coil the warp from the stern into the boat, while the other two boats are a-head lay∣ing fresh warps. The vessels sometimes carry from 150 to 200 men; and as their bigness prevents their sailing, except the wind be very fair, they warp thirty miles a day against the stream, which is ”very rapid."</Q></P>
<P>The danger of this voyage down the
<PB N="17" REF="28"/>
Volga will appear, when the nature of the country, and the structure of the vessels are known. The Russian government autho∣rizing vassallage, and giving one man a pro∣perty in the person and labour of another, no vassal can leave the dominions of his lord without his permission, and must re∣turn home, no matter how far off, or how difficult the journey, by the time limited: Those who fail, dreading the severe punish∣ment which awaits them, frequently turn pirates; and, joining themselves to the <HI>Khal∣muck Tartars</HI>, rob on the river. They go in gangs of thirty, forty, or even eighty persons, in row-boats, equipped with fire arms; and their piracy is commonly attend∣ed with the murder of the unfortunate who fall into their hands. The punishment in∣flicted on these wretches, when taken, is suitable to the cruelties they practise on others: A float is built, with a gallows erected thereon, and they are stripped naked, and
<PB N="18" REF="29"/>
with their hands pinioned behind, hung up by the ribs on hooks, and set afloat on the river; and it is a capital offence for any person to relieve or put an end, by death, to their tortures. They remain alive, in this dreadful situation, three, four, and sometimes five days, imploring water with the greatest ear∣nestness, and appear to die in a raging fever.</P>
<P>The Khalmucks do not sow or reap, or make hay for their cattle, which are horses, camels, cows, and sheep. The men live without bread or vegetables, and in the winter their cattle fare as wild beasts do. Their food is flesh, that of horses being pre∣ferred, fish, wild fowl, and venison, with milk, preserved in various ways; but mare's milk is most esteemed among them, and from it they extract a strong spirit, of which they are exceeding fond.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bruce.</NOTE></P>
<P>With respect to the vessels in use on this river, they are without knees, have but few
<PB N="19" REF="30"/>
beams, and their decks are only loose pieces of bark. In place of tar, slips of bark are nailed over the seams, to prevent the caulking from falling out.</P>
<P>On board one of these fragile vessels, on the fourteenth of October, Mr. Hanway embarked on this vast river. He was sur∣prised to see the banks marked in some places twenty feet above the water; but was told by the boatmen that the river rose in spring to that height. On the nineteenth he ar∣rived at Astrachan, where he was courte∣ously received by Mr. Thompson, agent at that place to the British merchants trading to Persia; and after remaining about three weeks, and procuring all the information he could of the voyage along the Caspian, he left Astrachan, and fell down to Yerkie, at the mouth of the Volga, the place where all vessels take their departure from, and which they endeavour to make on their re∣turn.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="31"/>The Caspian sea, at which he was now arrived,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This account of the Caspian is not taken from Mr. Hanway's description of it alone; but with the assistance of other surveys (particularly that made by order of the Czar Peter), and a manuscript account of it sent to Mr. Hanway in London, after the publication of his Travels.</NOTE> extends (from Yaeck, in 46 deg. 15 min. north latitude, to Astrabad, which is in 36 deg. 50 min.) 9 deg. 25 min. or 646 English miles; its breadth is very various, and its circumference has been measured to 3525 wersts. The water of the Caspian is as salt as that of the ocean; but as the moon must have its influence, on a water compa∣ratively so small as this, equally on all its parts at the same time, there is no tide. At Derbend, on the western side, there was formerly a watering place; but it has since been inundated. Shamakie is the most po∣pulous city in these parts, having factories from the eastern nations, which occasions it to be much resorted to.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="32"/>From the coast on this side the Caspian may be plainly seen the high mountains of Caucasus. The mountains of Taurus and Ararat are so contiguous, as to appear like a continuation of the same mountain; but Ararat is one vast rock, exceeding Cau∣casus in height: Its top is covered with snow throughout the year. The Arme∣nians, who call it Messina, pretend that there are still some remains of the Ark, which they say rested here after the deluge; but that by the length of time they are become petrified.</P>
<P>At Baku is seen, what the Persians call "The Everlasting Fire," an object of their devotion, and a phoenomenon of a very sur∣prising nature: About ten miles from the city are several ancient small temples, about fifteen feet high; in one of these, where the Indians now worship, is a large cane fixed in the earth, about three feet remaining in sight, from the end of which issues a blue flame,
<PB N="22" REF="33"/>
not unlike that of a lamp burning with spi∣rits, but seemingly more pure. Here are generally forty or fifty poor devotees, who come on a pilgrimage, to make expiation for their own sins, and the sins of their countrymen, and they continue the longer, according to the number of persons for whom they have engaged to pray.</P>
<P>A little way from the temple is a cleft in the rock, about six feet long and three broad, out of which issues a constant pure flame; when the wind blows it rises sometimes eight feet high, but is much lower in still weather.</P>
<P><Q>“The earth for above two miles round this place, has this surprising property, that by taking up two or three inches of the surface, and applying a live coal, the part which is so uncovered immediately takes fire. If a cane or tube, even of paper, be set about two inches in the ground, and the top of it touched with fire, immedi∣ately
<PB N="23" REF="34"/>
a flame issues without hurting the ”cane or paper."</Q></P>
<P>The river Kura or Cyrus, which is joined by the river Araxis, is the most considerable river on the western coast. Not far from Keslar stands the mountain Barmach, re∣markable for the oil called Naptha, which issues from it into thirty different pits, all within the compass of a musquet shot of each other. The river Oxus, on the opposite shore, is now about a musquet shot broad at its mouth. The lake or gulph Karabogaski is about two wersts broad at its inlet: Some people concluded that as the Caspian is never found to rise, notwithstanding the immense quantities of water that fall into it from the rivers and hills at the melting of the snow, that the water had an outlet in this gulph; but the gulph is as calm as any part of the sea. The country near this coast from near Astrabad to Kulalie, the boundary of Turku∣mania, is inhabited by rude and inhospitable
<PB N="24" REF="35"/>
Tartars, with whom no commerce has been had. The river Yaek is about 100 fathoms broad. The shore from this river to Yer∣kie is very shallow and over-grown with reeds for some miles into the sea. In these reeds are bred an innumerable quantity of water fowls of various descriptions.</P>
<P>November the twenty-second, Mr. Han∣way embarked on board the <HI>Empress of Russia</HI>, one of the two ships built by the factors, commanded by Captain Woodrooffe, and was much pleased to find himself in a good vessel, regularly built, and, probably, the first complete ship which had appeared on the Caspian. They sailed from Yerkie, and traversing the whole length of the sea from north to south, arrived, December the third, at Langarood, a bay at the south-west extremity of the Caspian, the then residence of Captain Elton, by whom he was kindly received; and after having remained seven days with him, he set sail for Astrabad, in

the south-east corner of the Caspian. As they steered eastward, the sky brightened, and the air, which had before been cold and wet, became gentle and warm. They were four days in sight of the great Peak or mountain Demoan; which, although said to be thirty leagues within land, they could distinguish very plain at the distance of four or five leagues from the shore.</P>
<P>On the eighteenth of December they ar∣rived in the bay of Astrabad. Here, as in other parts of the Caspian, the sea had made great inroads: Many trunks of trees lay on the shore, and made it difficult of access. They anchored at half a league distance from the land, and Mr. Hanway dispatched the Armenian, to inquire if the goods might be landed with safety; but he returned un∣able to procure any information. The people on the coast having been frequently plundered by the Ogurtjoy and Russian pirates, and seeing so large a vessel in their
<PB N="26" REF="37"/>
road, were under great apprehensions for their own safety.</P>
<P>On the twentieth, however, Mr. Han∣way went on shore. The stumps of the trees and shallows made it difficult for a long-boat to land nearer than twenty yards. Having satisfied the people that they were friends, he was received by them on the shore, and conducted, by many crooked paths through a thick wood, to a small vil∣lage. He sent the interpreter to the city, which was about eight hours distant, to pay his respects to Mahommed Zamon Beg, the governor of Astrabad, and to request his protection. In the evening the messenger returned: The governor promised his pro∣tection; but charged Mr. Hanway, in a very particular manner, not to repose any confidence in the peasants on the coast.</P>
<P>Whilst the ship remained in the bay, she was in some danger of being burned: A quantity of raw cotton which lay in the
<PB N="27" REF="38"/>
steerage, and was intended for the repackage of the bales of cloth in a proper man∣ner for camel and horse carriage, was set on fire by the carelessness of one of the seamen; but was with some difficulty extinguished before the fire reached the powder chest.</P>
<P>At night the woods on the mountains took fire, and the wind feeding the flame, made a dreadful blaze, which extended se∣veral miles, and by its heat made the butter on board the ship run like oil: The accident proved to have been occasioned by burning rushes on the coast, to destroy the insects which breed in them.</P>
<P>And now having accompanied Mr. Han∣way till his safe arrival in Persia, it will not be improper to inquire into the state of that kingdom.</P>
<P>Persia is bounded by the mountains of Ararat on the north-west; by the Caspian sea, which divides it from Russia, on the north; by the river in Oxus, which devides it
<PB N="28" REF="39"/>
from Usbeck Tartary, on the north-east; by India on the east, and by the Indian ocean, and the gulphs of Persia and Ormus on the south, and by Arabia and Turkey on the west.</P>
<P>In the year 1402, Tamerlane, the Tar∣tar chief, having subdued Persia, died, leav∣ing a succession of kings till 1500, after which the family of the Seffies possessed the throne for the space of about 220 years, until Maghmud, an Afghan chief, taking advantage of the indolence and timidity of Shah Sultan Hussein, the last prince of that family, procured himself to be seated on the throne.</P>
<P>Maghmud reigned until 1725, when he was in his turn deposed and murdered by Ashreff, who succeeded him in the diadem; and on the fifteenth of January, 1730, Ash∣reff was defeated in a pitched battle by the famous Tehmas Nadir Kouli, who had been raised to the rank of general to the legiti∣mate
<PB N="29" REF="40"/>
heir of Hussein. In 1736 Nadir pro∣cured himself to be crowned Shah or king, under the title of Nadir Shah.</P>
<P>The father of this famous usurper was an obscure Tartar, who procured a scanty sub∣sistence by making sheep-skin coats; and when he died, Nadir was used to gather sticks in the woods, and carry them to market on an ass, and a camel, which were his only patrimony. He was afterwards a robber; then a courier in the service of a Beg; and by the most enormous ambition, treachery, and murders, obtained the diadem and the complete conquest of the Persians, whom he ruled with the greatest rigour, oppression, and cruelty; depriving them of their pos∣sessions, and even lives, with unexampled wantonness, and spreading desolation and misery all around him.</P>
<P>Such was the state of this fruitful, and once splendid country, when Mr. Hanway arrived with his caravan in the city of Astrabad.
<PB N="30" REF="41"/>
Whilst he was employed in repacking his goods in a way proper for land carriage, he had opportunities of conversing with the in∣habitants on the distressed state of the coun∣try, and the prospect before him. The Ar∣menian interpreter, who had before been robbed near Mesched, now began to express fears of the danger they should be exposed to in the journey to that city; but as he had before been silent, and did not now point out any particular danger, Mr. Hanway did not think it necessary to pay great at∣tention to his representations.</P>
<P>On the fifth he prepared to wait on the governor; and having no equipage to make a proper appearance, Naseer Aga, in whose house he was lodged, lent him a horse hand∣somely caparisoned, and insisted on his taking his servants to attend him as well as his own. The present to the governor, consisting of several cuts of fine cloth, and some loaves of sugar, was carried in before him. On
<PB N="31" REF="42"/>
his entrance, he found the governor attend∣ed by many persons of the first distinction in the city, among whom were Mahommed Hassan Beg, son of the late Fately Ali Khan Khajar, who had been put to death by Na∣dir, Mahommed Khan Beg, and Sadoc Aga, the two last the sons of Khans in high fa∣vour with the Shah. <Q>They all rose up at his coming in, and the governor bade him welcome to Persia, adding, in the true east∣ern style of compliment, “that the city of Astrabad was now his to do what he pleas∣ed ”with it."</Q> To this a suitable answer was made on the part of Mr. Hanway, who re∣quested his assistance and protection; and after some further discourse, in which the governor assured him the passage to Mesched from thence was perfectly safe, and promised to send some of his soldiers to escort him thither, Mr. Hanway took his leave.</P>
<P>Naseer Aga, of whose humanity and po∣liteness he had received such signal proof,
<PB N="32" REF="43"/>
was now a venerable old man, of a serious but inviting aspect. He had been the com∣panion of Nadir, when he was the chief of a band of robbers in the neighbouring moun∣tains; but he was too good a man for Na∣dir's purpose; and the mediocrity of his fortune, and his want of ambition, had se∣cured him from the calamities which usually fell on such of Nadir's favourites, as pro∣fessed any regard to justice or conscience.</P>
<P>Having agreed for camels and horses to carry his merchandize, with some difficulty on account of the mercenary and deceitful temper of the natives, he prepared to set forward on his journey to Mesched; but the drivers, some days after their agreement, re∣presented that, as the camels could not keep pace with the horses, it would be advisable to load and send them off some days before he departed himself with the horses. It was with great reluctance that he consented to the separation of his company, especially as
<PB N="33" REF="44"/>
the behaviour of the drivers gave him no very favourable idea of their fidelity; but urged by the necessity of the case, and the representations of his new friend Naseer Aga, he consented to load forty bales on ten camels, and sent them forward, fixing four days after for his own departure with the rest of the merchandize on the horses.</P>
<P>He then made another visit to the gover∣nor, who, to his great mortification, behaved to him in a very distant manner, and ac∣quainted him that he could spare but one soldier to escort him: His mind ap∣peared to be clouded with some great per∣plexity, which as Mr. Hanway could not develope, he took his leave, without think∣ing very deeply about it.</P>
<P>The day after that on which the forty bales of cloth had been sent away, the city of Astrabad was alarmed with the rumour of an insurrection of the neighbouring people: Signals were made to call the inha∣bitants
<PB N="34" REF="45"/>
and their cattle within the walls; the shops were shut, and the men prepared for defence. It appeared that Mahommed Hassan Beg had left the city in secret, and now ap∣peared in arms at the head of a party of the provincials with an auxiliary body of Turkuman Tartars, declaring that they meant to possess themselves of the Shah's treasure, which was then lodged in the city, and of the European, goods; and to further their rash designs, they gave out that the Shah was dead.</P>
<P>A city besieged and incapable of defence, a weak and faithless garrison, and the gene∣ral report that the Turkuman Tartars were the most savage of the human race, and would, in all probability, put Mr. Hanway to the sword, were circumstances of no com∣mon apprehension. His attendants advised him to disguise himself in a Persian habit, and escape from the city; but as he was at a distance from the bay, and if he should
<PB N="35" REF="46"/>
be able to reach it, the ship would probably have failed, he determined to remain with his merchandize in the city, in his proper cha∣racter, which he was best able to support, and in which, if it should be so decreed, he thought it most honourable to die.</P>
<P>The dastardly governor had already fled from the city, disguised like a peasant, and mounted behind a real peasant. Those among the inhabitants who were not inclin∣ed to commotion, now cursed Mr. Hanway as the cause of their misfortune, by bring∣ing so valuable a caravan into the city, to attract the avarice of the rebels.</P>
<P>Nothing can display a man's character for courage and address more truly than his behaviour in a situation like this, because it has danger enough to prevent every kind of artificial deportment; and Mr. Hanway's conduct at this juncture was such as he could always after reflect on with pleasure and satisfaction. After making,
<PB N="36" REF="47"/>
with great deliberation, the best disposition of his servants and effects to receive the in∣vaders, whom he saw it was impossible to resist, he directed a watch to be kept all night, that he might not be surprised. In the evening he retired to his apartment, to pre∣pare his own mind for any event that might happen; and as it was his usual practice to commit all his material thoughts to writing, he entered in his journal a prayer to this effect:</P>
<P><Q>“O God, thou hast been my succour through all the perils and vicissitudes of my life: If it is thy good pleasure yet to preserve that life, let all my future hopes, and all my wishes, centre in thee alone. Let the remembrance of thy mercies in∣spire my mind with the most ardent love, the most exalted gratitude. Let the ten∣der laws of humanity ever possess my soul. But if it is thy will that I now render back this vital heat which sprang
<PB N="37" REF="48"/>
from thee: if thy gracious providence has ordained that my life be now brought to an end by these unthinking men; thy will be done: Avert, O Lord, the de∣struction that threatens them, and lay not my blood to their charge! Succour me in the secret paths of death, and re∣ceive me into the glory, which thou hast ”prepared for thy servants."</Q></P>
<P>With these meditations he retired to rest, and was awaked at four in the morning, after a sleep of five hours, by a smart but ir∣regular fire of musquetry. A silence en∣sued, and the city was given up to Mahom∣med Hassan Beg. Noise and merriment seemed necessary to support the spirits of the insurgents: They seized the city drums; and a large party went about beating them, and hallooing. Zadoc Aga, who was now ap∣pointed a Sirdar or general, with Mahommed Khan Beg, both young men of more fire than judgment, headed a party of men, and came
<PB N="38" REF="49"/>
to the house in which Mr. Hanway resided. He had collected his attendants in a room together, from whence he sent the Tartar boy to conduct these hostile visitors to him. He entreated them that, as he was now at their mercy, they would behave to him with humanity. They declared they did not mean to hurt his person; but on the con∣trary, as soon as ever <HI>their government</HI> was established, they would pay for the goods which they then seized, and informed him the forty bales, sent out laden on the camels, were already in their possession.</P>
<P><Q>"As gold," says Mr. Hanway on this oc∣casion, “can purchase every thing, except virtue and wealth, understanding and beauty; when my money was demanded, I reserved a purse of 160 crowns in gold, thinking it might administer to our safe∣ty:" ”but he soon found that his security was in his supposed poverty; for in three
<PB N="39" REF="50"/>
weeks distress which succeeded, he durst not shew a single piece of gold.</Q></P>
<P>Some days after two Turkuman chiefs were introduced to him by the newly made governor Baba Zadoc, who asked the Per∣sians in his hearing: <Q>“You give us the merchandize of the Russians, will you not give us the Russians also? They will ”do well to tend our sheep!"</Q> They were pacified by the natives; but the knowledge this gave Mr. Hanway of their disposition, determined him to quit the place as soon as any opportunity should present itself. Se∣veral of the Turkumans, at different times, intruded themselves into his house, pre∣tending a curiosity to see him; but he afterwards learned, their real intention was to consult by what means they might carry him off.</P>
<P>The perplexity he observed in the coun∣cils and conduct of the insurgents, joined to the knowledge he had of the force and
<PB N="40" REF="51"/>
disposition of the Shah, gave him very un∣favourable presages of their approaching fate; and he was firmly of opinion their reign could continue but a very short time. Every way, however, he saw danger threatening himself: If they retreated from the city, they might carry him with them into the inhospitable deserts of Turkumania, or destroy him for their own convenience or safety; and if they succeeded, the Turku∣man party would increase, and he might be carried a slave into their country.</P>
<P>But even in these perturbed times, there were not wanting some among the inhabi∣tants of Astrabad, whose love of justice and humanity convinced them that, what∣ever motives they might have to rebel against the Shah, they had no right to rob a stran∣ger; and some of these gave him informa∣tion, and even assisted, as far as was safe, in his preservation.</P>
<P>After experiencing much of the insulta,
<PB N="41" REF="52"/>
and wanton cruelty, of the rebels, he de∣termined to leave Astrabad at all events, although its environs were infested with flying parties of the Tartars, and seek the protection of the Shah, who was reported to be near Ghilan with his army. This in∣tention he thought it advisable to conceal with the utmost precaution; but he directed his interpreter to deliver to Mahommed Hassan Beg, an account of the value of the goods, and to demand a bill for the amount; which he obtained of him, and an engagement to provide ten armed men to escort him to Ghilan.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth of January he left Astrabad under convoy of a Hahdgee,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is a general title bestowed on all who have made a pilgrimage to Mecca.</NOTE> who had been introduced to him by Naseer Aga on his first arrival, his brother and two sons, and about twenty armed villagers; and ar∣rived, after a few days journey, at a small
<PB N="42" REF="53"/>
town belonging to the Hahdgee. His bro∣ther, whose character did not appear to be very amiable, would have conducted him to his house, which he said was in the ad∣jacent mountains; but he had experienced too much of Persian infidelity to trust himself in such a situation. The Hahdgee, who had been acquainted with the circumstances of the rebellion at the time of Mr. Han∣way's first arrival, and seduced him to remain in the city, merely that he might partake in the spoil of his effects, supposing that he was yet possessed of some things of value, thought it would be inconsistent with his interest to suffer him to carry them off; and he exerted all the cunning of his country to obtain them. He even declared the car∣riers should not proceed, unless Mr. Hanway left his baggage with him; and he was con∣strained to deliver up the gross thereof, tak∣ing care to conceal about his person as much of value as was possible.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="54"/>They then proceeded on their journey, through pathless woods, over ditches and hills, taking care to keep the least frequented way, and lying in the open fields. In their way they passed by the ruins of the palace of Farabad, once famous for the residence of the Persian kings. The carriers had en∣gaged to conduct him to Balfrush, the capital of the province of Mesanderan; but hear∣ing that the Shah's admiral was levying forces to oppose the Astrabad rebels, they re∣fused to proceed any further. He requested they would at least convey him to a place where horses or some other cattle might be procured; but this also they refused, alledg∣ing that he was near the coast, and might go by sea. Accordingly, they conducted him and his attendants to a fisherman's hut, on the sea coast: The poor man had only an open boat, like a canoe, very leaky, and too small for six persons; besides it could be navigated only with oars or paddles near the
<PB N="44" REF="55"/>
shore, where the surf then ran very high; and the sand banks forming breakers, made the sea still more dangerous. He, therefore, again implored the carriers to furnish horses according to their engagement, but they treated his request with contempt. He threatened to use force; whereupon two of them, being armed with matchlocks, lighted their matches, two others had bows and arrows, and all of them, being six in num∣ber, had sabres. Mr. Hanway collected his company, among whom were four mus∣quets, a blunderbuss, and a pair of pistols; but as he could not depend on more than two of his servants, after a short parley, he submitted to run the risk of being drowned, rather than engage in a fray, where no other advantage could be obtained, than the preca∣rious use of horses, through a country ut∣terly unknown to him.</P>
<P>Trusting, therefore, to Providence, he em∣barked in the boat with his servants; and
<PB N="45" REF="56"/>
with much fatigue and danger, favoured by the winds, he arrived safe at Teschidezar, in the next province; and learning that the Shah's officers were there collecting their forces, he begged their protection; and the chief sent him a horse handsomely capari∣soned, with four mules for his servants; and on the thirtieth he arrived at Balfrush, where he was assured by the Persian mer∣chants, that the Shah would certainly make good his loss.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was this escape which gave Mr. Hanway the first idea of his motto. When he returned to England, he had painted on his chariot, a man dressed in the Per∣sian habit, just landed in a storm on a rude coast, and leaning on his sword, his countenance calm and re∣signed. In the back ground was depicted a boat, beat about by the billows; in front, a shield charged with his arms leaning against a tree, and underneath, the motto in English, "NEVER DESPAIR."</NOTE> Mahommed Khan, the ad∣miral, told him he might think himself for∣tunate in having escaped with life; and re∣commended to him to continue his rout by water to Ghilan; and, indeed, so unable
<PB N="46" REF="57"/>
was the force at that time with the admiral to oppose the Tartars, who were now in the neighbourhood, that they all prepared for flight, and Mr. Hanway saw that he had no alternative but to wait and receive his conquerors a second time, or to depart un∣protected, without guides or attendants. He applied to Mahommed Khan for horses, who promised to supply him; but, after many prevarications, sent him one mortally distempered, and exceedingly poor in flesh. He was in some doubt whether he should accept the beast; but at length he determin∣ed on his mode of proceeding: He took an affectionate leave of his interpreter and ser∣vants; and leaving with them the rebels' passport, and what money he could spare, he recommended them to the protection of Providence, and sat out alone on his journey. The Tartars were entering the city at one gate, when he went out at the other. After some time, he fell in with a party, who con∣ducted
<PB N="47" REF="58"/>
the baggage of the admiral, and himself soon followed; but it was not pos∣sible for him to keep pace with them. The poor Tartar boy, attached to him with more sincerity than his other servants, had followed him on foot; and when he fainted, he took him up behind him; but before they had rode six miles, the horse's hind quarters gave way, and they were both ob∣liged to dismount.</P>
<P>In this situation, without guide, and un∣derstanding but little of the language, it was with great difficulty he explored his way to the coast once more. He now found it ne∣cessary to put on the meanest appearance possible: His clothes were worn out and in tatters. They had several rivers to pass; but pleading poverty, they were carried over gratis. He had retained the greatest part of the money he had concealed at Astrabad, but dared not to shew it. At length the admi∣ral's company halting, he got up with them
<PB N="48" REF="59"/>
again, and was joined by his clerk and ser∣vant, who had fortunately procured horses.</P>
<P>The next day he sent to the admiral for other cattle, who ordered them; but demand∣ing more than five times their value, he pro∣cured some of another person. The ad∣miral now made a feint, as if he meant to stop the progress of the insurgents, who were advancing in pursuit of him, and or∣dered all the avenues to be guarded. Mr. Hanway had then not eaten any thing for near forty hours, except at few parched pease, which he had by chance in his pocket; and was driven to beg of the pea∣sants, what he dared not buy.</P>
<P>In the night, although the admiral had pro∣mised not to march without him, he quitted the place with all his baggage, leaving Mr. Hanway and his servants behind, without the least provision, and unprotected. Trust∣ing to Providence, he again determined to follow the admiral, whom fortunately he
<PB N="49" REF="60"/>
overtook. In a dark and tempestuous night, in which, however, he had, with great difficulty, been able to keep pace with the baggage horses, until he was quite spent; urged by despair, he seized the bridle of the horse on which the admiral himself was mounted, and pronounced the word <HI>Shah</HI> with the utmost emphasis. The determined seriousness with which he uttered this word brought the Persian to that sense of duty, which his promise, or the dictates of huma∣nity, had not effected: He halted, and or∣dered his Visier to take him up behind him, till he afterwards procured a horse for him∣self; and one of the carriers had compassion on the faithful Tartar boy, and took him Up. The clerk and servant had yet strength to walk; but the former, after a few miles, not able to proceed, begged Mr. Hanway to re∣lieve him with the use of his horse, to which he consented, till his own fatigue obliged him to dismount his fellow traveller; and from
<PB N="50" REF="61"/>
that time he saw no more of his clerk till some days after his arrival in Ghilan.</P>
<P>The apprehensions of the admiral, who knew the cruel disposition of the Turku∣man Tartars, hurried him on from seven in the evening till the same hour next morning; and, after a short refreshment, till four in the afternoon, amidst a continued rain and tempest. Mr. Hanway was more than once overcome with sleep and fatigue; but still it was his good fortune to get up with his company again.</P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth of Febru∣ary, intelligence was received that a body of Tartars had been at the house the admiral had slept at; and in their rout between the confines of a wood and the sea shore, the advanced guard gave the alarm, as if a body of Tartars had been posted in the wood; the courageous admiral immediately changed his clothes for mean ones; and preparing for battle, gave orders to fire in upon them:
<PB N="51" REF="62"/>
When Mr. Hanway came up, he found five miserable Afghan recruits, who had been travelling towards the Shah's camp, weltering in their blood, and expiring of the wounds they had received. The next day and night they travelled twenty hours. The inroads of the Caspian, and the torrents from the mountains, had formed many chan∣nels, some of which were hardly fordable; and the surge on the sea shore, near which they were sometimes obliged to pass, threw down several of the horses, and their riders were in danger of being drowned. On the seventh the admiral thought himself out of danger, and relaxed a little in his pace.</P>
<P>It is not the custom in eastern coun∣tries for any man to come near the women, except their lord; but circum∣stances had happened in this expedition which prevented a strict regard to distinc∣tions; and Mr. Hanway had more than
<PB N="52" REF="63"/>
once the office (not a very dignified one in Persia) of guarding the admiral's women.</P>
<P>He had now passed through the whole province of Mesanderan; but such had been his distress, and the inclemency of the weather, that in twenty-three days he had not enjoyed an hour of security or unbroken sleep. He was drawing near to Lan∣garood, which he had left seven weeks be∣fore; and Captain Elton hearing that he was on the road, sent a servant with horses to meet him, and received him with open arms, congratulated him on his having escaped with his life and liberty, and confi∣dently assured him that the Shah would cause justice to be done him.</P>
<P>After a few days his clerk and servant, who had been left behind, were brought in by Captain Elton's servants: The clerk ap∣peared as a man expiring in a lingering con∣sumption; he had been two days and three nights exposed to the weather without shel∣ter
<PB N="53" REF="64"/>
or food, and five times robbed, till he was left nearly naked. The interpreter arrived about three weeks after: He had obtained a passport from Sadoc Aga, under his seal, the style of which, considering all circum∣stances, conveys a curious idea of Persian folly. It was in these words:</P>
<P><Q>“TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMIES BE IT KNOWN, THAT MATTEUSE, THE AR∣MENIAN, IS HERE: LET HIM NOT BE MOLESTED, BUT LIVE UNDER OUR ”SHADOW."</Q></P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Langarood, his feet and legs were much swelled; his clothes had not been put off for a long time, and having no opportunity of attending to the natural delicacy of his constitution, he found his health much impaired. After stay∣ing some days with Captain Elton, to refresh his wearied spirits, he took his leave and set out for Reshd, where he arrived on the nine∣teenth, and with difficulty procured an inter∣view
<PB N="54" REF="65"/>
view with the governor of the province, who informed him the Shah was expected to be in Turkey, or near the borders of Syria, in a short time; on which he determin∣ed to continue his journey in search of him: and having provided fresh clothes, horses, and tents, and firelocks and sabres for his five attendants, he sat out from Reshd, and on the second of March arrived, very near blind with the reflection of the snow which lay on the ground, at Casbin, where was a new palace built by Nadir Shah.</P>
<P>This city is famous for having been the re∣sidence of many of the ancient kings of Persia: It was one of the chief cities of Parthia, and the burial place of Hephestion, the favourite of Alexander the Great; but it was now almost ruined, and the inhabitants were re∣duced to distress by the cruel oppression of Nadir.</P>
<P>March the eleventh, the weather having become mild, and the snow being in a great measure dissolved, Mr. Hanway joined a
<PB N="55" REF="66"/>
company going to the camp of the Shah, who was reported to be marching towards Hamadan. On the road they passed by the skeletons of several camels, whose flesh had been devoured by wolves, and saw all the way the miserable effects of Nadir's tyran∣ny, in the extreme distress of the inhabi∣tants. The whole appeared a scene of desolation; and the people taking them for robbers, or soldiers, which were as bad, fled to the mountains, and left them to provide for themselves.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway now discovered that all his Persian fellow travellers were in the custody of a messenger, who was conducting them to the camp; and such was this terror which Nadir's cruelty had excited, that this single person kept eight or ten officers of distinc∣tion, with all their servants, prisoners.</P>
<P>On the twentieth they arrived at the Shah's camp, and Mr. Hanway pitched his tent near the royal standard, which was
<PB N="56" REF="67"/>
no sooner done, than an accident happened that was very near preventing him from ever telling his adventures. He had ordered the fire arms to be placed round the inside of the tent; and while he was standing up, one of the firelocks, which in Persia have no guard to the trigger, went off, and car∣ried two slugs through the top of the tent, just over his head. The tent being of cot∣ton was set on fire, but no notice was taken of the accident.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Hanway, immediately on his arrival in the camp, had delivered his petition, pray∣ing to be reimbursed the value of his cara∣van, into the chancery; and in a little time obtained a decree of the Shah, “that the particulars of his loss should be delivered ”to Behbud Khan, the Shah's general," now arrived at Astrabad, “who was to return such parts of the goods as could be reco∣vered, and make up the deficiency out of ”the sequestered estates of the rebels."</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="68"/>This decree, although a signal mark of the justice of Nadir, was yet ungrateful to our traveller, because it made it necessary for him to return again to Astrabad, the scene of his former troubles; but his zeal for the cause in which he had embarked overcame every obstacle.</P>
<P>Whilst Mr. Hanway waited to receive an answer to his petition, he had leisure to make observations on the objects before him. He visited every part of the Shah's camp, informed himself of the manner of conduct∣ing his wars, transacting the business of state, of his force, amusements, and character.</P>
<P>Such was the disgust which the tyranny of Nadir had excited in the breasts of the Persians, and so many rebellions against his government were on foot, that the utmost exertion was necessary on his part to coun∣teract them. He was in his tent of audi∣ence from seven in the morning till ten at
<PB N="58" REF="69"/>
night, except retiring for very short inter∣vals.</P>
<P>In placing the camp, the tents of the ministers and principal officers were in the front, or to the right and left of the Shah's quarters, that some of them might be always near him. The circuit of the Shah's own tents was very large; the entrance consisted on one side of a line of uniform tents, serv∣ing for guard-rooms, and on the other of the teats in which the affairs of the chancery, and the like public concerns, were transacted. About two hundred yards beyond this ave∣nue was the pavilion in which the Shah usually sat to give audience, and transact business; the front was always open, even in the worst weather; but when it was ex∣tremely cold, several pots of charcoal were set in the middle. Behind the pavilion were placed the Shah's private tents, to which were admitted only his secret emissaries, when they had any remarkable intelligence
<PB N="59" REF="70"/>
to communicate. Near these were the tents of the Shah's ladies; and the whole was surrounded by a fence, round which the night guard patrolled, and severely punished any who were found near the quarter of the women. None but the officers in immediate waiting were admitted into the royal pa∣vilion: The officers of state and people of business stood in the open air in all wea∣thers, forming a semicircle in front of the tent.</P>
<P>The market, which was well supplied with provisions, apparel, horse furniture, and other necessaries, was about half a mile long, consisting of tents on each side like a street. The shopkeepers of consequence were ge∣nerally under the protection of some of the principal courtiers, who took care to be in∣terested in the profits, particularly of flour and rice, of which there was always a great consumption. The Shah often inquired into the prices of provisions, and reduced
<PB N="60" REF="71"/>
them as he thought proper, fining the market people upon every transgression.</P>
<P>The two imperial standards, although it required twelve men to move them, were lengthened in the staffs by Nadir, and made still heavier, to prevent their being carried off by the enemy, except in an entire de∣feat. The Shah had about sixty women, and nearly the same number of eunuchs, who, in a journey, generally rode near his person; before him were his running footmen and body guards, spreading a mile or two: These gave notice of his approach, and cleared the way. When he travelled with his women, the army was kept at almost a mile distance.</P>
<P>Nadir's standing forces were computed at 200,000 men; to support which, Persia had been ruined, and India spoiled of one hun∣dred and twenty millions sterling, and near twice as many thousand souls. He thought a soldier always fought better when he had
<PB N="61" REF="72"/>
something to lose, therefore encouraged the wearing of costly furniture, particularly for the horse. He himself had four complete sets, one mounted with pearls, another with rubies, a third with emeralds, and the last with diamonds, most of which were of a prodigious size; but set in a barbarous taste, several being bored through.</P>
<P>Cosmin Khan, the chancellor, was em∣ployed, whilst Mr. Hanway was in Persia, in writing the history of Nadir's wars; but no account of the completion of the work has appeared: which is not, perhaps, much to be regretted, as Nadir had a sight of it from time to time in its progress.</P>
<P>The Turkish language is the most com∣mon in Persia. In matters of learning they use the Arabian, in which is preserved the greatest part of that knowledge, for which the Persians were once distinguished. As time seems to have made little change in the customs of Asia, the same manners remain
<PB N="62" REF="73"/>
as are read of two thousand years ago; and the language retains the same idiom and sublimity of expression.</P>
<P>The Persians write like the Hebrews, from the right to the left, and often range their lines in an arbitrary manner, so that on one leaf the writing shall have ten different directions, all in exact proportion, as to distance, and the number of words and lines in each.</P>
<P>While Mr. Hanway remained in the camp, he was witness to several acts of cruelty, committed by Nadir. He had ap∣pointed a certain general, governor of a pro∣vince, on which an exorbitant tax had been imposed, to be levied in six months: At the expiration of the term, the governor was sent for to the camp, and required to pro∣duce his account: He did so; but it amount∣ed to only half the sum demanded. The Shah told him he had embezzled the other half of the money, and ordered the execu∣tioners
<PB N="63" REF="74"/>
to bastinado him to death. His estate, when confiscated, fell very short of the de∣mand, and his servants were ordered to come into the Shah's presence. He inquired of them if there was any thing left, belong∣ing to their late master: They answered, "only a dog;" which being brought before Nadir, be observed that the animal appeared to be much honester than his master, and directed that he should be led through the camp, from tent to tent, and beaten with sticks; and wherever he expired, the mas∣ter of the tent should pay the money de∣ficient. The dog was accordingly carried to the tents of the ministers successively, who immediately gave sums of money, ac∣cording to their respective abilities, to pro∣cure his removal; and the whole sum de∣manded was raised in a few hours.</P>
<P>Soon after a man was executed with cir∣cumstances, which gave Mr. Hanway a yet stronger impression of the Shah's cruel
<PB N="64" REF="75"/>
disposition. The man was accused of hav∣ing made greater exactions in his employ∣ment of a tax-gatherer, than he had ac∣counted for to the Shah. Being condemned to death, Nadir said to him, <Q>“I understand you can dance well; dance and I will save ”your life."</Q> <Q>The man began immediately to dance, in transports of joy; but the Shah ordered the executioner to strike him on the legs, which preventing his performance, the tyrant cried, “the rascal dances ill; kill ”him."</Q></P>
<P>The twenty-seventh of March Mr. Han∣way set off from the camp. The spring being already advanced, the brightness of the sky, the falls of water from the rocks, the stupendous mountains, far higher than any he had seen in Europe, rising gradu∣ally one above another, some with their summits covered with snow, and others con∣cealing their heads in the clouds, formed a delightful scene. The vines were full of
<PB N="65" REF="76"/>
foliage; the orange groves perfumed the air with their fragrance, and the gardens were in full blossom. <Q>Where possession is inse∣cure, and the husbandman knows not that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e shall be permitted to reap the fruit of what he sows, the hand of industry is never very conspicuous; "but here," says Mr. Hanway, “nature, with a little labour, seemed ”to furnish all that was needful or pleasant."</Q> The return of spring naturally delights the mind: but must have been particularly delightful to one whose winter had been at∣tended with such circumstances of distress.</P>
<P>April the fifth he arrived at Langarood where he was again kindly received by Mr. Elton, and remained with him till the first of May, when he left that place to travel by land through the province of Mesanderan to Astrabad. There were in all in his com∣pany six persons well armed. The first even∣ing, they were benighted and lost their way in a wood; but at length, discovering
<PB N="66" REF="77"/>
a light, they made towards the place and found the house barricadoed with trees. They used every entreaty to persuade the master of it to conduct them on their journey; but their rhetoric not having the desired effect▪ they proceeded, like true Persians, to break into his house, and tying a rope to one of his arms, compelled him to conduct them; but this outrage being the effect of mere neces∣sity, Mr. Hanway took care to reward him well for his trouble, and sent him home again when they had regained their path.</P>
<P>They had not proceeded far before two of the men hired to conduct the baggage, through feat or some worse cause, left their loads and their company in a very abrupt manner. The next night, while the horses and mules were at pasture, a wolf of a very extraordinary size, of which there are many in the neighbouring mountains, made his appearance; but being driven off by the guard, he contented himself with killing a
<PB N="67" REF="78"/>
cow. In the morning they came up with a detachment of fifty soldiers, the comman∣der of which very courteously offered them his service as a convoy, which Mr. Hanway was very ready to accept, and pursued his journey in their company.</P>
<P>As they advanced further in the province, the peasants grew more insolent. Mr. Han∣way had separated from the officer, and had obtained of him ten of his company as a guard; and now the villagers, many of whom had been engaged in the late insur∣rection, apprehensive that the soldiers had orders to arrest them, took to their arms, and refused to supply them with any provisions. He, however, procured some food, on con∣dition that the soldiers should remain all night under arms in the field, where he him∣self pitched his tent; but the guards left their convoy in the night, contrary to their en∣gagement, and proceeded to take care of themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="79"/>Early in the morning they struck their tents, and, to avoid the excessive heats, de∣termined to travel only in the mornings and evenings. At <HI>Amul</HI>, a city situate at the foot of that part of mount Taurus, where Alexander is said to have encamped and re∣freshed his army, they saw the ruins of one of the cities of ancient Persia, and a palace of stone, which Shah Abas the Great often made his residence.</P>
<P>Here Mr. Hanway met with a writer who had retreated with him before the Tur∣kuman Tartars from Astrabad, from whom he learned that Sadoc Aga and his troops, when they came into this place, were not above one hundred and fifty in number; but as the admiral had but sixty fighting men with him, they would certainly have attacked him if the town's people had not magnified his force: That Zadoc Aga, to give a formidable impression of the num∣bers in his army, had demanded of the
<PB N="69" REF="80"/>
city fifty thousand pairs of horse shoes;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Shah had established a manufactory at Amul for making horse-shoes and other works in iron.</NOTE> and that the rebels were entirely defeated.</P>
<P>On the ninth, Mr. Hanway arrived at Balfrush, where this news was confirmed, and he was further informed that the people of Astrabad had submitted very quietly to Sadoc Aga, the rebel governor, while he was in strength; but that he having left Ismael Beg, a person of distinction, as their gover∣nor, upon the news of the rebels being de∣feated, they had seized their new governor, and cutting holes in his flesh, they set light∣ed candles in them, and in that state led him naked about the market place, until he dropped down dead. Cruel treatment of a man, whom their own actions had testified, they thought was guilty of no crime!</P>
<P>On the thirteenth of May, leaving Bal∣frush, Mr. Hanway proceeded on his jour∣ney,
<PB N="70" REF="81"/>
and travelled some miles on the great Causeway, made by Shah Abas the Great, which runs near three hundred English miles. They passed by several temples of the ancient Gebres, or worshippers of fire (where at one time possibly was the same phoenome∣non as at Baku) and also the ruins of a pa∣lace built by Shah Abas, far exceeding in grandeur any other on the coast of the Cas∣pian sea. On the sixteenth they reached Astrabad. As they approached, they met several horsemen carrying home the captured peasants, whose eyes had been cut out; the blood yet running down their faces. Near the entrance into the city were two pyra∣mids of stone, each of forty feet high, built by Nadir, in which were niches, the greater number having human heads placed in them, being the heads of people who had offended the Shah, and had been exe∣cuted by him or his generals.</P>
<P>On his arrival this second time at Astra∣bad,
<PB N="71" REF="82"/>
Mr. Hanway waited on Behbud Khan, the general, to whom he presented the de∣cree he had obtained of the Shah, who promised him that he would cause it to be executed with the utmost effect. He was seated in his aivan or tent, with a semicircle of soldiers drawn up below him, judging and executing, in a very summary way, the rebels who were brought before him, one or two at a time. After a short repast, a prisoner was brought who had two large logs of wood rivetted to the small of his legs, and a heavy triangular collar of wood about his neck; one of the angles being longer than the others, served as a handcuff to his left wrist, so that if he attempted to rest his arm, it must press on his neck. After being questioned for some time about the caravan of European cloths, of which it appeared he knew very little; the general ordered him to be beaten with sticks, which was immediately performed by the execu∣tioners
<PB N="72" REF="83"/>
with the utmost severity, as if it was intended to kill him, and the scene was closed with an order to cut out his eyes. Sadoc Aga was then produced. In the hour of his short-lived prosperity, while he was a general of the rebel troops, he had treated Mr. Hanway with an unbecoming insolence; but how changed was his appearance! When Mr. Hanway saw him last, he was a youth of uncommon vivacity, richly dressed, and full of mirth; but now his garb was mean, his voice sunk, and his eyes cut out of their sockets. <Q>He expressed his inability to make any restitution of the property; “for he ”had been deprived of every thing."</Q> This answer the general returned, by an order to strike him on the mouth, which was done with such violence that the blood gushed out.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway might have now retorted on some of these wretched men, the taunts they had bestowed on him, while he was in
<PB N="73" REF="84"/>
their power; but resentment was not a pre∣vailing passion in his composition: His hu∣manity led him to consider that there is never a proper time to insult the wretched; and he took his leave in silence, having his heart too full to enjoy this kind of enter∣tainment, although he could perceive the general imagined the scene would have af∣forded pleasure to him.</P>
<P>Whilst he was waiting to receive the remains of the cloths as they were found, he was witness to several executions of the unfortunate rebels, which were conducted with very little ceremony: They were led to a field near the residence of the military judge, and being made to kneel blind-folded, and pronounce the creed, <Q>“There is but one God; Mahomet is ”his prophet, and Ali his friend," the head was taken off with the motion of a sabre in a thrusting cut, which in drawing back completed the operation.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="85"/>The payment for the rest of the value of the goods, over and above what had been recovered, being made very slowly, Mr. Hanway represented to the general the in∣conveniency he suffered by the delay. He acknowledged that a part of the money had been appropriated to the Shah's use; but proffered him some of the women prisoners, who might be sold as slaves, in part of pay∣ment; and upon his refusal to accept this kind of compensation, the general endea∣voured to procure of him a receipt for the amount, and to take his bill payable in fif∣teen days; but Mr. Hanway had experienced too much of Persian infidelity, to sign an instrument which might be produced against him as evidence of his having received complete satisfaction.</P>
<P>On the twenty-ninth of June, having obtained in goods and money eighty-five per centum of the original value of his cara∣van; and Captain Woodrooffe having in∣formed
<PB N="75" REF="86"/>
him he was arrived in the bay with the ship, he left Astrabad, and embarked on his return.</P>
<P>In their voyage along the southern coast of the Caspian, they were attacked by seven of the Ogurtjoy pirate boats. His com∣mission from his Russian partners prohibited him from interfering in any thing military; but some shot being fired gave the pirates such an idea of their great guns, that they desisted and fled.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived at Langarood on the twenty-third of July, he found Cap∣tain Elton in a very bad state of health. He staid with him a week, and then set off for Reshd; but the season being very un∣healthy, he was seized himself with a dan∣gerous and uncommon sickness, which de∣tained him till the thirteenth of September, when he left Reshd, and embarked at Pere∣bezar. He had invested the whole sum re∣covered by virtue of the Shah's decree, in
<PB N="76" REF="87"/>
raw silk, which he had now the satisfaction to see safe on board in the Caspian; and after a passage of thirteen days he arrived at Yerkie. Here he was visited by the com∣mander of the guardship, who informed him that if he had any other goods on board, but such as were the produce of Ghilan, and did not declare it, the law made it death to the offender. The governor of Astrachan had been informed that there was a plague at Cashan, from whence manufac∣tured Persian goods were wont to be brought into Russia; and to prevent infection, the commander required the ship's crew to come on shore on a small uninhabited island on the east side of the Volga, and a fire being made, the surgeon and his attendants took the windward side of them, and demanded to see their breasts: When he was satisfied they had no infection, their letters were de∣livered to him, being first dipped in vinegar, and dried in the smoke; but after waiting
<PB N="77" REF="88"/>
till the eleventh of October, in very cold and dangerous weather, they had the mortifica∣tion to learn that they were ordered to per∣form a quarantine of six weeks on the island Caraza, situate a little way up a branch of the Volga, towards the east.</P>
<P>The quarantine being expired, they were required to strip themselves entirely naked in the open air, and go through the unpleasant ceremony of having each a large pail of warm water thrown over them, before they were permitted to depart; but what gave Mr. Hanway the most uneasiness was, to hear that the dispatches, which he had sent forward in one of the Empress's boats, had been taken by the Khalmuck pirates, and twelve soldiers, who were the guard, put to death.</P>
<P>The twenty-second of November, he de∣parted from Astrachan for St. Petersburgh. The Volga was covered with ice, so that the passage to Zaritzen by water was now obstructed. He determined, therefore, to
<PB N="78" REF="89"/>
travel by land on the western side of the river, and reaching Zaritzen on the eleventh day after, arrived at Moscow the twen∣ty-second of November. Here he received letters, acquainting him of the death of a relation, by which he reaped certain pecu∣niary advantages, much exceeding any he could expect from his engagement in the Caspian affairs: <Q>“Providence was thus in∣dulgent ”to me," says he, “as if it meant to reward me for the sincerity of my ”en∣deavours."</Q> The distance between Mos∣cow and St. Petersburgh, as already men∣tioned, is four hundred and eighty seven English miles; yet he arrived there in three days, drawn in a sledge over the frozen snow. The road is marked by rows of trees, planted about twenty yards asun∣der, and the conveyance is so easy to the traveller, that he slept whilst they travelled hear seventy miles. On the first of January, 1745, he arrived at St. Peters∣burgh, after an absence of a year and six∣teen
<PB N="79" REF="90"/>
weeks, in which time he had travelled about five thousand four hundred English miles.</P>
<P>At this place he had some differences with the persons who had been interested in the Caspian trade; but they were such as a failure of success was likely to produce, and being re∣ferred to arbitration were amicably adjusted, and he resided at St. Petersburgh five years.</P>
<P>During this period, the Russian factors used all their endeavours to induce Captain Elton to leave the service of the Shah, and return to his original alliance; but in vain, he continued inflexible. It appeared, in∣deed, that at one time, when an honourable appointment in England was offered to him, that he had requested the Shah to permit him to sail to Astrachan in one of his own ships; but his request was refused by the Shah; a translation of whose decree was transmitted to London, by Elton, and is as follows:</P>
<P>"BY merits of the Almighty God, our
<PB N="80" REF="91"/>
commands are obeyed. The properest of the Christians, GEMEL BEG,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name given by the Shah to Elton, signifying <HI>The Lord of Beauty</HI>.</NOTE> commissioner of our royal navy on the Caspian sea, is by our imperial and most gracious favour exalt∣ed, and given to know that his petition, with regard to his finishing one large ship, and desiring leave to go with such ship to Astra∣chan; and concerning several other points; is come to our most sacred presence, and the meaning thereof understood. But as our imperial design is to call the properest of the Christians, at new year, to our victorious stirrup, and to settle our naval affairs on a right foundation: Therefore, the properest of the Christians must defer going to Astra∣chan himself, but send such sailors as he has with him, who understand navigation, to take care of the ship to that port; and the properest of Christians must remain where he is, and finish the other ships ordered,
<PB N="81" REF="92"/>
give full directions concerning them, and not exclude himself; but, on the contrary, make the beauty of his service appear in the presence of our universal glory; taking this as a command, and to remain in his duty. Dated the 26th of the moon Sheval, 1158."</P>
<P>After Mr. Hanway left Persia, Nadir Shah, whose cruelty had continued to en∣crease with his years, was beset with rebel∣lions in every quarter of his dominions; his own relations, to whom he entrusted his armies, deserted his cause, and his situa∣tion became truly dangerous. At this crisis he called before him some of the Ousbeg and Turkuman Tartars, who composed part of his army, and having sworn them to secrecy and obedience, he disclosed his de∣sign of putting to the sword all the Persians in his camp the following night.</P>
<P>A Georgian slave, in Nadir's tent, over∣heard some part of the conference, and
<PB N="82" REF="93"/>
discovered it to some of the principal Persian officers. In such an extremity, the only re∣solution to be taken was, that Nadir should die: Salib Beg, an officer of great intrepi∣dity, commander of the body guard of Afshars, offered his service, and demanded only for chosen men to assist. A few hours before the signal was to be given for the in∣tended massacre, Salib Beg and his followers, under pretence of urgent business, passed the guard, and rushed into Nadir's tent. When they approached, he drew his sabre, and demanded what business they had. Salib Beg made no answer, but struck him with his sabre: The blow was aimed at his head, but fell on the shoulder. Nadir killed two of the soldiers, and was retiring out of the tent when he fell over the cords. The tyrant cried, <Q>“Have mercy, and I will for∣give ”you all;" to which the officer replied, “You have shewn no mercy to others, there∣fore ”merit none yourself;" and gave him a mortal wound.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="94"/>The Tartars, to whom Nadir had always been partial, no sooner heard of his death, than they made a general attack on the Per∣sians: before day-light five thousand men were destroyed; and the army separated, after a continued campaign of eighteen years.</P>
<P>It is a curiosity natural to the mind to in∣quire the fate of Elton, who preceded Mr. Hanway in the voyage to Persia, and, by his abilities, obtained the confidence and support of the Shah.</P>
<P>Nadir's death did not quite quash the hopes of Captain Elton. The peasants of Ghilan attempted to assassinate him, and a ball, fired from a secret hand, passed through his coat; but he escaped, and survived, un∣der the protection which his abilities procured him from <HI>Ali Kouli</HI>, Nadir's nephew and suc∣cessor. After his death, the Persians having no king whom they thought proper to obey, the elders of Ghilan took the people under their care, in form of an aristocracy. Captain
<PB N="84" REF="95"/>
Elton, who knew these men meant no good to him, refused to obey them, and shutting himself up in his house, determined to op∣pose them; but not having sufficient strength, he capitulated with <HI>Hahdgee Gemal</HI>, their chief, for the safety of his person and ef∣fects; but the faithless Hahdgee, like a ge∣nuine Persian, regardless of his word, seized his effects, and condemned him to be hanged. He was leading to execution, when news arrived that one of the chief captains in the elders' army, was gone over to Ma∣hommed Hassan their enemy. This threw every thing into confusion; the elders were obliged to fly, and they carried Elton along with them. It was hoped this change in their affairs would have awakened some pity in the breasts of the elders, and that Captain Elton would have escaped; but they were incapable of commiseration, and he was shot by their orders in April, 1751.</P>
<P>Thus fell this enterprising Englishman,
<PB N="85" REF="96"/>
whose whole life was a scene of strange adven∣tures, and whose extensive mind had formed a plan, and even proceeded to execute it, for introducing the manufactures of England into the furthest parts of Persia; a country so re∣mote, so difficult of access, and at that time so shook and disturbed by intestine war and commotion.</P>
<P>It comes not within the limits of this de∣sign, intended to convey to posterity some idea of the intrepidity, perseverance, and ad∣dress of Mr. Hanway, to describe more mi∣nutely the present state of the empire of Persia, and the manners of the inhabitants. If what is here mentioned shall awake the curiosity of the reader, he may find it agreeably satisfied by recurring to the Travels themselves; and the learned student will accompany him with peculiar pleasure in his journey over this truly classic ground, the seat of arts, of arms, and the theatre of noble events, from the earliest traces of time. However,
<PB N="86" REF="97"/>
as <HI>Nadir Shah</HI> makes a principal figure in this relation, I have here added some of the leading features of his character, in Mr. Hanway's own words; which may serve as a specimen of his style in this difficult species of composition.</P>
<P><Q>“<HI>Nadir</HI> was an Afshar, his face was rounder, and his nose less inclined to the Roman, than the Persians generally are. His hair was black; his eyes large and expressive; his forehead high; and his complexion swarthy. His body was ro∣bust; and his stature about six feet; his shoulders were round. His whole coun∣tenance and person were awful, particu∣larly ”when he spoke.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“His voice was so strong and sonorous, as to be audible to an incredible distance; and the effect it had upon his own soldiers, as well as an enemy, when he gave his commands in the field of battle, proved one
<PB N="87" REF="98"/>
great step to his advancement to the regal ”power.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“His corporal strength was not less in∣strumental to his fortune. The extreme indulgence which had been shewn him by nature, in the vigour of his constitu∣tion, received an accumulated force by ”the habit of his life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The battle-ax is one of the most ancient weapons among the Orientals; but it had been for some years much neglected in Persia; Nadir restored the use of it, in a more particular manner; it was his fa∣vourite weapon, insomuch, that before he assumed the diadem, he was generally styled the Ax-Khan. Afterwards he was often seen with a battle-ax in his hand, playing with it in his tent of audience. His blows with this weapon carried with them inevitable death, of which he gave many proofs, His memory was as re∣markable, as his perfect knowledge of the
<PB N="88" REF="99"/>
genius and temper of the Persians. As he had no turn to contemplation, his spirits were free and untired by any reflections but what immediately arose from his employments in the field. He was far advanced in life before he had learnt to read; nor did any part of his knowledge depend the least on books. His presence of mind was very remarkable; and his re∣solutions were almost as quick as his thoughts; hence he did many things ex∣”travagant and absurd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“At one part of his life he drank freely of wine and brandy; but afterwards ab∣stained from the latter intirely, and used the former, in such a proportion only, as gave the greater energy to his thoughts, and supported the activity and strength of his body. He used to feed liberally upon a simple diet; yet he would march a whole day upon the strength of a few
<PB N="89" REF="100"/>
parched peas, which it is common for the ”Persians to carry in their pockets.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“His dress was not remarkable; his mind seemed to be superior to external pomp or luxurious softness. His pride was in precious stones, with which his diadem was adorned, and he wore several in his turbant also. He was often seen with a large sapphire in his hand, with which ”he used to amuse himself in his tent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Some instances of Nadir's cruelty were the effects of policy. Upon occasion of his memorable exploit of driving the Af∣ghans out of Persia, when he entered Isfa∣han in triumph, one of his soldiers vio∣lated the wife of a Persian of distinction. The man complained to Nadir, that he ”could not live after so great an indignity:</Q> 'No,' says Nadir, 'I think you cannot;' <Q>“and immediately ordered him to be strangled. He then explained to his of∣ficers the reason of his conduct, in these
<PB N="90" REF="101"/>
”terms:</Q> <Q>“A victorious army cannot al∣ways be restrained. Had I redressed this man's wrongs, I should have a hundred such complaints made to me, and my time would have been taken up in chastizing my soldiers, instead of employing them ”to conquer the enemies of our country.'</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He suffered several to pass with impu∣nity, though he knew they gave him no less harsh an appellation than villain; but towards those who exercised their wit in keen satire, he was inexorable. It is a compliment amongst the Persians, to say, ”upon the entrance of a guest, “Your place ”was very void.</Q> In the mausoleum which <Q>“Nadir caused to be built at Mesched, for his reception after death, some body wrote ”on the walls, in very pathetic terms; “O Nadir! how full of thy renown is every corner of the earth: Thy name indeed is very great; but thy place here is very ”void.</Q> <Q>Severe inquisition was made for
<PB N="91" REF="102"/>
“the author of this writing; it was con∣cluded to be done by some man of letters; and many Mullahs were brought to a trial; to compel them to a discovery, some were whipt to such an extremity, ”that they expired under the lash.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“In allusion to Nadir's exaltation, a cer∣tain person observed of a fountain in Isfa∣han, that the higher the water was thrown up, the greater was the velocity of its fall. Nadir never wanted the base instruments of tyranny to acquaint him of the minu∣test actions; and this man gratified his ”wit at no less an expence than his life.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“He treated common men, and delin∣quents of the highest rank, without much distinction of persons. It was no unusual sight in the chancery, to see those who had been the day before bastinadoed al∣most to death, whose eyes had been put out, or their nose cut off, yet brought
<PB N="92" REF="103"/>
before him to be further questioned. Upon these occasions, they have often sunk down through pain or want of rest; and these miserable objects have been also ob∣liged ”to travel with the camp.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The avarice of this tyrant was no less remarkable than his cruelty. It was his custom, according to the practice of for∣mer kings, to send for the governors of the provinces, however remote from his camp, to appear before him every new-year's day. His intention in this very frequently was to mulct them, or put them to death. His ordinary method was to interrogate them concerning the state and condition of the province, and of their own behaviour in particular. From thence he proceeded to trifling and superfluous questions, concluding that he supposed ”they had defrauded him of large sums.</Q> <Q>These questions were ordinarily followed
<PB N="93" REF="104"/>
“by the bastinado, to induce them to condemn themselves, or to accuse other people of being depositaries of con∣siderable sums. It frequently happened that these persons, either to avoid the pain of corporal punishments, or with the hopes of being restored to their govern∣ments, have given in a fictitious list of persons as their debtors, with the sums due from each, and also of effects deposited in their hands. They even took this oc∣casion to gratify their private resentments, by mentioning those as their debtors, who had given them any offence. The conse∣quence of these declarations was the issu∣ing a decree, ordering the collection of such sums and effects, by the severest ex∣ecutions of military law, without any liberty of appeal previous to the payment. If these pretended debtors, after a severe beating, were found incapable of pay∣ment,
<PB N="94" REF="105"/>
orders were often given to collect ”such sums from the province.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It does not appear, from any circum∣stance of the first stage of this man's life, that his temper was avaricious. It is na∣tural to believe, that he thought nothing could secure his usurpation better than the poverty of the people, as the most effec∣tual means of preventing their rebellions, or of rendering them abortive. This is the best argument that can be brought in extenuation of that crime, which at length became the great moving principle to drown Persia in blood. Poverty, without doubt, was a great discouragement, and often proved a bar to the success of their attempts against him. But what can we say of his unjust and cruel treatment of private persons, merely for the sake of what they possessed; where there was not the least reason to suspect their ”loy∣alty?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="106"/><Q>“In 1740, several districts in Ghilan were ordered to equip soldiers for the service of the crown, and to be answerable in the penalty of one thousand crowns for each deserter. This proved a source of oppres∣sion; for these recruits were generally ill paid, and ill treated in the army, that they might be tempted to desert; and the pay∣ment of the penalty was always rigorously ”exacted of the securities.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“When he found himself bound in honour to disapprove of the behaviour of his governors, of whose unjust conduct all possible evidence had been given, his decrees for restitution to the complainants were generally expressed in such ambigu∣ous terms, as rendered the applications for justice vexatious, and the issue of them oftentimes unsuccessful. Sensible of his predominant vice, his greatest officers greedily amassed riches, as the surest means of their preservation; though it
<PB N="96" REF="107"/>
frequently happened, those very riches were the cause of their destruction. Hav∣ing been often challenged to answer for their corruption, several of the most con∣siderable amongst them, at length resolved to keep a regular account of all presents they received, that in case of need they might produce it; but still it was a mis∣fortune to possess any money; for Nadir seldom thought he had got their all. Shew and equipage is a favourite passion among the Persians, yet I observed the governors who came to answer for their conduct, and other great officers, chose to walk on foot in the camp, rather than appear in any circumstances of affluence. As to the officers of rank, they imagined their se∣curity ”consisted in refusing presents.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Avarice, the peculiar weakness of old age, increased on Nadir with his years; yet his rapaciousness might not be entirely an effect of this passion. If we consider the
<PB N="97" REF="108"/>
vast expence of his army; the impossibi∣lity of raising taxes upon his people, in the latter part of his reign; and that his safety depended on the military power with which he was surrounded; his In∣dian treasure, though reputed very large, was not sufficient to check his apprehen∣sions ”of want.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Much may be alledged for the suspi∣cious turn which he took; for the Per∣sians are as gentle, soft, and persuasive in their manners, as they are full of cunning and deceit. They are polite, and affect condescension to strangers or guests; but where they have any power or authority, their deportment is selfish, haughty, and insolent: To this we may add a strong propensity to rebellion. From his earliest life Nadir had an experimental knowledge of them, in all their several ranks and conditions; and seemed now to have adopted as an invariable maxim, that they
<PB N="98" REF="109"/>
could be ruled only with a rod of iron. Thus several causes concurred to cherish a cruel, jealous disposition. As he mount∣ed the throne by means of the corruption and immorality of the people, policy still required him to sow the seeds of a jealous enmity among the principal persons under ”his command.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Whilst Nadir's glory was ripening, it was his policy to make great professions of esteem to those whose services he stood in need of; but afterwards he acted on the wretched maxim, that a king has no friend or relation: Gratitude, conse∣quently, could not appear as a princely virtue, nor have any seat in his breast; on the contrary, he seemed diffident, that those who were capable of a zealous con∣cern for his interest from a principle of affection, might, on the same principle, be partial to others also, if his conduct ”should render him ungrateful to them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="110"/><Q>“But the amiable qualities of the mind be∣ing so rare, they could be no great objects of his dread; the perfections most level to his observation, and which struck most forcibly on his mind, were corporal strength and valour. Though he often stood in need of these, the person who acquired any distinguished reputation for them, be∣came the object of his envy, if not of his fear. Of this they told me a remarkable ”story.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“A certain soldier had often distinguished himself in the field of battle: His skill in the use of the sabre was not less extra∣ordinary than his corporal strength, and he was at length made a Khan. The Per∣sians, in their hyperbolical manner of speaking, say, that this man could cut a mule, with a pack-saddle on her back, through at one stroke. It is hardly cre∣dible how much the Persians esteem bodily strength, and military abilities: Nadir cast
<PB N="100" REF="111"/>
a jealous eye on this person; as if he meant to try his virtue, he gave him the charge of a beautiful girl, to be carried to his brother Ibrahim Khan. On the way he debauched her; and Ibrahim disco∣vering the indignity, sent her back to his brother. It is easy to imagine that Nadir would resent the affront also; in short, he vowed to shed the blood of the of∣fender. Riza Kouli Myrza, then in high favour with his father, had a very parti∣cular regard for this officer; he attended the prisoner before the Shah's pavilion, pleaded his cause and obtained his pardon. Nadir, for the sake of his vow, ordered a bit of the offender's ear to be cut off. This, however, was but a temporary re∣prieve: Soon after he was sent to burn a Turkish village; but before it was possible for him to arrive there, he was recalled, and questioned why he had not performed his orders; and after several imperious
<PB N="101" REF="112"/>
insults, Nadir commanded that he should be strangled. Before the bow-string was thrown about his neck, he made a sign, as if he had something of importance to communicate; and, as is usual in such cases, a suspension was permitted. The Khan availed himself of this interval, to plunge out of the hands of the execu∣tioners; and, seizing the sabre of one near him, rushed forward towards the Shah, who rose from his seat, and retired before his enemy. The attendants near the royal pavilion interposed, and killed the delinquent, but not before he had slain ”three of them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The natural pride of the human heart is flattered, when our superiors bring themselves down to our level. The gene∣ral who is not over tender of his person, becomes the minion of the common sol∣diers; but if to courage he adds liberality, he subdues their hearts. Nadir was a
<PB N="102" REF="113"/>
master of every art of this sort, and in his first appearances of life, gained the universal affection of the army. He was no sooner vested with a command, than he became assiduous to ingratiate himself with the soldiers, not only by procuring them their pay in due time, but also good clothing at an easy price, with the addition of occasional gifts. He was not ignorant of the use of clemency, in circumstances of great importance: A party of Ousbegs, who had done him signal service in battle, afterwards deserted from him; he sent a body of troops, and brought them to his camp as prisoners; they expected death; but he bid them continue to serve him faith∣fully, as they had already done, and made every private man a present of fifty crowns, and gave five hundred to each officer. Common prudence, indeed, obliged him to be watchful of the oeconomy of his
<PB N="103" REF="114"/>
army: yet the meanness of his educa∣tion could not be corrected by his ad∣vancement to the diadem; and whilst jealousy and distrust became his con∣stant companions, cruelty and avarice gained the ascendant over him, in every action of the latter part of his life; this appeared in many circumstances, not only towards his army, but to the people in ”general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“No part of Nadir's character was more distinguished, than that of a general; he lived in the field in the several characters of a peasant, a captive, a servant, a rob∣ber, a soldier, a general, and a king. Bred up in all the arts and subtleties of the Tar∣tars, he acquired a great proficiency in the practical knowledge of robbery. Hence it is easy to imagine, that a person of his extraordinary natural talents and personal strength, should become forward, bold, and enterprizing. Enured to a military life,
<PB N="104" REF="115"/>
he acquired a strong inclination for that variety which a continued change of place is apt to create. The intrepidity which he possessed in so eminent a degree, is a dazzling quality among men professing arms; but success established his character ”as an able and fortunate general.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“His quickness of observation where his forces were weakest, and his presence of mind in succouring them, ever gave him a wonderful superiority over his enemies. His resolution seemed to inspire his people with a determined purpose to conquer or die; nor did his officers ever behave ill with impunity. In action, he generally tired many horses, being never long mis∣sing where his presence was needful. Up∣on these occasions he was wont to address his men in such familiar terms, as seemed to demonstrate an opinion that a soldier will not perform his duty well, when he has no regard for his general. He found it
<PB N="105" REF="116"/>
indispensably necessary to keep his army in motion, to prevent those conspiracies, for which a great part of his soldiers were always ripe; by this means also, the people in the remote parts of the empire were kept in awe, and he was ready to op∣pose the invasion of his neighbours, or to ”make conquests.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“As he enjoyed great health, and was enured to exercise, his activity was hardly to be exceeded. His mind was strongly tinctured with the notion of predestina∣tion, and he became so much the more dauntless by it; yet we do not find that he fell into the absurd practice of deviat∣ing from the dictates of common sense, with which this erroneous principle some∣times affects its votaries. He seldom placed a confidence that was unnecessary, or exposed himself to a danger that was avoidable. In the conduct of his wars, he ever preferred stratagems to force.
<PB N="106" REF="117"/>
His marches were always amazingly rapid, and his progress so irregular, and contrary to the ordinary rules of war, that he con∣founded his enemies. In the height of his grandeur he would, upon any emergency, out march his baggage, and suffer any hard∣ship incident to a common soldier. Thus he often defeated the best laid schemes of his enemies, and attacked them where they were least able to defend themselves. Yet in matters of the greatest moment, his resolutions were generally so quick, and surpassing ordinary apprehensions, that it seemed doubtful whether they were the effects of a solid judgment, or a blind temerity. Under the difficulties in which he was often involved, irresolution seemed to be what he dreaded most; nor did he dare to ask advice, lest he should weaken ”the superiority by which he governed.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Many circumstances of the politics of this extraordinary man were unfathomable,
<PB N="107" REF="118"/>
particularly in his punishing offenders; petty crimes he often chastized with heavy punishments, whilst offences of the blackest dye sometimes passed with impunity, or a slight resentment. Even those who had been in open rebellion against him, he has more than once reinstated in their office, or pre∣ferred them to greater dignities. Thus he seemed inclined to trust those who had been his avowed enemies, rather than such ”as he had not yet proved."</Q></P>
<P>IT was Mr. Hanway's wish to quit St. Petersburgh, and come to England much sooner than he did; and the frequent disap∣pointments that happened to prevent his returning to his native country increased his desire of seeing it.</P>
<P>The ninth of July, 1750, he left St. Pe∣tersburgh, and passed by Peterhoff, a palace built by Peter the Great, on an eminence on the south side of the Gulph of Finand,
<PB N="108" REF="119"/>
thirty-five wersts from St. Petersburgh. <Q>It was then not uncommon for the Russians to compare the water-works of this place with those of Versailles, with this distinction in their favour, “that the waters of Peterhoff ”are sweet."</Q></P>
<P>Passing the gulph he had an opportunity of viewing the dry-dock, contrived by Peter, at Cronstadt, so large as to receive fourteen ships of the line, to build or re∣pair in the dry, and afterwards to float them by letting in the water.</P>
<P>On the fifteenth he embarked in a yacht belonging to Dantzig, and in three days ar∣rived at Revel, the capital of Estonia. When this place surrendered to Peter in 1710, the plague had raged with such fury, that, of fifty thousand inhabitants, not four thou∣sand remained alive to receive their con∣querors.</P>
<P>On the twenty-fourth he arrived at Dant∣zig, where he was very politely received by
<PB N="109" REF="120"/>
Mr. Gibson, who was then resident from the king of Great Britain, and procured a copy of the celebrated painting of Van Eyck, representing the blessings of the virtuous, and the torments of the wicked, which he brought with him to England.</P>
<P>He staid a week at Dantzig, and, having bought a chariot, passed through Prussian Pomerania, taking in his way Stolpe, Neu∣gerten, Koeningsburg, Bernau, and came to Berlin. Here were several persons of learning and abilities, particularly Voltaire; Baron Polnitz, author of the Memoirs known by his name; Pillotier, author of the History of the Celts; and Lieberkyn, physician to the king of Prussia.</P>
<P>Lieberkyn was a man after Mr. Han∣way's own heart: His great abilities and disinterested practice, his humanity to his patients, and his great charity to the poor, had made him universally respected. These good qualities naturally led Mr. Hanway to
<PB N="110" REF="121"/>
seek the Doctor's friendship, which he at∣tained. Here was also Mr. Schmidt, the en∣graver, a subject of the king of Prussia, whom he brought with him to Berlin from Paris, and who in his art had hardly a superior.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was at Berlin at the time of the Carousal, a season devoted to pleasure, and dissipation of thought. One part of the entertainment was a procession of four parties or companies, in the proper habili∣ments of Romans, Carthagenians, Grecians, and Persians, all mounted on horses richly caparisoned in like manner. A mock battle was afterwards fought, which was a much more splendid entertainment. <Q>“Four thousand men having marched out in the morning early, about a German mile from the city, were followed by ano∣ther detachment of the same number. Both armies plied their artillery warmly. A rivulet was passed, a wood was attacked, and the enemy driven from it to a village,
<PB N="111" REF="122"/>
which was carried sword in hand. After this they went through all the evolutions, and exercises, of both cavalry and in∣fantry. At this show almost the whole ”city of Berlin was present."</Q></P>
<P>Whilst Mr. Hanway remained here, Lord Malton, afterwards Marquis of Rockingham, arrived, to whom Mr. Hanway paid his re∣spects; and when he had viewed the curiosities of Berlin, went to Charlottenberg, and Pots∣dam, and saw the gardens and apartments of Sans Souci, a small palace, then the fa∣vourite retreat of the king.</P>
<P>The twenty-third of August he left Pots∣dam, and came to Wittenburg, in the Electorate of Saxony, famous for its manu∣factory of coarse cloths; and passing through Annaburg, and Grosshagn, came to Dres∣den, the metropolis of the Electorate, where he was introduced to several persons of dis∣tinction, particularly the young Count Buenau, and M. de Veith, master of the ceremonies
<PB N="112" REF="123"/>
to the king of Poland, by the latter of whom he was attended to the Grune Ge∣wolbe, a part of the palace which is a repo∣sitory of great riches, as well as curiosities. Among the curiosities shewn him here, was a set of bells made of Dresden porcelaine.</P>
<P>From Dresden he came to the castle of Meissen, in which is the porcelaine manu∣factory. The workmen, who are about seven thousand, are all confined as prisoners. The castle is impenetrable to any but the persons immediately employed, and the se∣cret of mixing and preparing the ingredients is known to but very few even of these. This article was importable, only under an oath of its being for private use, and not for sale, although the shops of London were in general supplied with it.</P>
<P>Passing through Leipsig, he came to Magde∣burg; he was yet in the dominions of the king of Prussia. The posts are under the direction of the government, and one-third part of
<PB N="113" REF="124"/>
the hire goes to the crown: Near Helmstet the postillion attempted to pass through a bye-way to avoid payment of a small duty; an officer who was posted at an avenue to prevent this practice, rode up, stopped the chariot, and seized one of the horses as forfeited; and would not desist till Mr. Hanway alighted, with a pistol in his hand, and acquainted him that whatever fault the postillion had committed, he himself had paid for the horses according to the laws, therefore if he presumed to detain him, he would resist him as a robber; upon which the officer thought proper to let him pass.</P>
<P>From Helmstet he came to Wolfenbuttle, the next day to Brunswick, and from thence to Hanover, where he was visited by Count William Bentinck, who happened to be in the same inn. The palace of Herenhausen, which is commonly recommended to the at∣tention of travellers, he found very short of his expectation. The building is by no means
<PB N="114" REF="125"/>
grand; but the garden may be admired. In it is a jet d'eau, erected by an Englishman, which throws the water seventy feet high.</P>
<P>September the thirteenth, he left Han∣over, and passing through Zell, Weissen∣dorff, and Zoehrendorff, came to Hamburg, where he met with many factors with whom he had been connected in a mercantile line, particularly Mr. Bosanquet, Mr. Hanbury, and Mr. Thornton, deputy governor of the British company.</P>
<P>After staying at Hamburgh about three weeks, he went to Bremen, intending to go on to Embden; but the weather being unfavourable for travelling, he determined to make the best of his way to Amsterdam, where his correspondency as a merchant procured him acquaintances; of the want of which, foreigners not interested in com∣merce generally complain when they come to this place.</P>
<P>October the sixteenth he left Amsterdam,
<PB N="115" REF="126"/>
and went by water from Haerlem to Ley∣den, and from Leyden to the Hague; pas∣sing through Rotterdam, he went in a yacht to Helvoet, and after a passage of twenty-two hours from Helvoetsluys, land∣ed at Harwich the twenty-eighth of Octo∣ber, 1750, after an absence from his native country of near eight years.</P>
<P>It was Mr. Hanway's constant practice, from his early youth, to commit to writing not only every occurrence of moment, but his thoughts on it at the time: In the rough journal of his travels there is a short reflection on the pleasure he felt in being once more safe landed on his native land; and in a fair transcript of the journal, seem∣ingly made with intention to be printed, this reflection is much amplified, and con∣cluded with some stanzas of the Ode writ∣ten by Mr. Addison, on his return from his travels, which I cannot forbear adding here, although so well known.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART II.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>THERE never was a truer patriot than Mr. Hanway: The love of his native country he carried with him wherever he went; and he omitted no opportunity of informing himself of the events which
<PB N="118" REF="129"/>
passed in it. <Q>Nothing that happened among his friends was indifferent to him; and he at last relinquished a lucrative line of trade, to return to England, that he might “<HI>consult his own health, and do as much good to him∣self ”and others as he was able."</HI></Q> <Q>"You know, my dear, —" says he, in a letter written from Petersburgh to a most intimate friend in London, “that it is only the desire of gain∣ing somewhat, to make the evening of my life comfortable, in my native land, which keeps me here. I have lost one partner (he was old and his death to be expected), and I must stay some time longer to in∣form my new one, who is young, and has all the sanguine expectations of a young man; but I covet no more than I can enjoy: What should detain me an eager votary of fortune, who am drooping under ill health, languishing for a life of reason, and wishing to lay down my head in peace whenever my hour shall come?
<PB N="119" REF="130"/>
It is not to play at cards, to flatter, to dance, and to drink, that I desire to return to you, though I can bear all these, except drinking: <HI>your Radcliffe's library, and fireworks, and quiet evening assembly</HI>, I consider as Milton's description of Hea∣ven; and if I am not destined to die a martyr here to the Persian trade, I will set off soon for my dear country, and my ”much-loved friends."</Q></P>
<P>He had now attained his wish, and the reader must take his leave of him as a tra∣veller. The rest of his life, with the ex∣ception of two short intervals, was spent in England, in a continued course of good actions, pursued with such assiduity, that this latter part of it was hardly less active, though certainly less exposed to danger, than the former.</P>
<P>When Mr. Hanway arrived in London, he went to live at the house of his sister, then Mrs. Townsend, in the Strand, where
<PB N="120" REF="131"/>
proper apartments had been prepared for him; and his mercantile affairs being finally closed, except only some remittances which he received afterwards from his partner at St. Petersburgh, he lived here as a private gentleman. His fortune was small; but it was sufficient to satisfy all his wants, and afford a portion to alleviate real distress, when it came to his notice. His carriage, which was of the kind called a <HI>Solo</HI>, from its holding but one person, was ornamented with his motto, <HI>"never despair,"</HI> and the de∣vice of a man just escaped from a storm at sea, on a desolate coast, as described in page 45. His time was passed in arrang∣ing the materials for a publication of his Travels; in transacting the business of his brother Thomas (who was now Captain of the Windsor, and had distinguished himself in several engagements), and in acts of kind∣ness and beneficence suited to his income.</P>
<P>He chose to print his Travels at his own
<PB N="121" REF="132"/>
expence, that he might not lead a bookseller into an engagement to his loss, and engaged some of the best artists of the time to en∣grave the charts and maps, which he had procured abroad, and to design and engrave some of the principal events that happened to him in the course of his travels. I think I have heard him say the printing and en∣graving cost him seven hundred pounds. The first edition of twelve hundred copies, in four quarto volumes, was published in Ja∣nuary, 1753, and received with universal approbation; and when the concurrent testi∣mony of men of taste and learning had given the work the stamp of merit, he closed with an offer made him by Mr. A. Millar, the bookseller, for the sale of the copy-right. Mr. Millar published a second edition in two large quarto volumes, and after that a third and fourth editions were printed and sold.</P>
<P>The close application he had bestowed
<PB N="122" REF="133"/>
on this favourite object having consider∣ably impaired his health, which at the best was but indifferent, and made some relaxation necessary; as soon as he had disposed of his interest in his book, and sent copies to some of his friends abroad, he went to pass a few weeks at Tunbridge Wells. The waters, and the amusements of the place, were of great service to him; and his health being consider∣ably recruited, in the beginning of Septem∣ber he sat out on a journey to Paris. He staid at Paris about a month, and having viewed the curiosities of that city, and the neigh∣bouring palaces, returned leisurely to Lon∣don, by way of Lisle, Brussels, Antwerp, and thence to Amsterdam.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>NATURALIZATION OF THE JEWS.</HEAD>
<P>WHILST he was on this tour of amuse∣ment and information, the great question
<PB N="123" REF="134"/>
relative to the expediency of naturalizing the Jews came to be agitated, and hardly any par∣liamentary business caused a more violent altercation. It became the reigning sub∣ject of conversation in all parties; the public prints were full of arguments on one side or the other, and the clamour spread itself abroad, wherever Jews were permitted to reside or to trade. Mr. Hanway thought it a duty to take a part in this popular question; and having reduced his argu∣ments against the proposed bill for natu∣ralization into writing, he sent the manu∣script to London to be printed in the form of a pamphlet. The clamour continu∣ing to increase, he sent over a second edi∣tion, with some small additions made to it at Amsterdam, which also was printed here.</P>
<P>In October he arrived in England, and went again to Tunbridge Wells, the
<PB N="124" REF="135"/>
waters of which had done him such service. At this place he prepared for the press his <Q>“<HI>Review of the proposed Naturalization of the ”Jews,</HI> in which he endeavours to prove, from scripture, from the antient and modern establishment of that people, and the com∣mercial system between this kingdom and foreign nations; that to give the Jews the right of natural born subjects, would be highly impolitic:</Q> And this afterwards prov∣ed to be the opinion of the majority; for though the bill passed into an act, 26 Geo. ii cap. 26, it lived only a few months, be∣ing repealed the very next session.</P>
<P>Some facts stated in Mr. Hanway's book On the subject, relative to the behaviour of foreign nations towards the Jews, had occa∣sioned an answer from an anonymous au∣thor, who attacked the veracity of his representation in rather an illiberal manner; and Mr. Hanway thought it necessary to
<PB N="125" REF="136"/>
vindicate himself; which he did with spirit and candour, in <HI>"Three Letters in Reply"</HI> to this writer, published in November, 1753.</P>
<P>The Stat. vii. Jac. 1. declares that the <HI>test</HI> of subscribing the declaration against tran∣substantiation, and receiving the sacrament according to the rites of the church of England, as enacted by the 25th of Car. ii. shall be required of all persons before they apply to be naturalized: The act for natu∣ralizing the Jews was intended to repeal this clause, with respect to them; and a pam∣phlet having been published, intitled, <HI>"Test and Contest,"</HI> Mr. Hanway wrote an answer to it, and took his leave of the subject.</P>
<P>The question is now almost forgotten; but it may be worthy the consideration of the serious, and perhaps an argument in favour of the truth of our holy religion, that the Jews have never, in any part of the world where they have been dispersed, been
<PB N="126" REF="137"/>
incorporated with the natives; but remain to this day, however separated from their brethren, a distinct and peculiar people. <Q><HI>The sentence originally denounced against them, that they should</HI> “be removed to all the king∣doms of the earth, and become an astonish∣ment, a proverb, and a bye-word amongst all ”nations," <HI>still remains in its fullest force</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>It was this spirited opposition to an impolitic law, which even the most intelli∣gent among the Jews thought inexpedient, that laid the foundation of Mr. Hanway's celebrity as a public spirited man: His writings on the subject were eagerly read by persons of both parties, and he is supposed to be the principal means of causing the re∣peal of the act.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="127" REF="138"/>
<HEAD>PLAN FOR AN UNIFORM PAVEMENT OF THE STREETS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time, 1754, Mr. John Spranger, a gentleman of Covent Garden, formed the outline of a plan for <HI>Paving the Streets of the City and Liberty of Westmin∣ster</HI>, in an uniform manner, which he published.</P>
<P>Some regulation of the pavements through∣out the metropolis had long been thought absolutely necessary; for the form, and level, and the quality of the materials within every parish or district, were left to the discretion of a few inhabitants, who took the lead in their respective districts, and in some places all form and regularity were lost, by neglect∣ing to repair the defects as they were occa∣sioned,
<PB N="128" REF="139"/>
or by repairing them in an improper manner. These defects proceeded most fre∣quently from the bursting of the pipes laid for the conveyance of water to the houses: The water issuing from the bursted pipe, spread under ground, and destroyed the foundation of the pavement.</P>
<P><Q>Ever attentive to the public interest, in December, 1754, Mr. Hanway published his “<HI>first Letter to Mr. Spranger, on his ex∣cellent Proposals for Paving, Cleansing, and Lighting the Streets of Westminster, &amp;c."</HI> in which, after making observations on the good effects likely to accrue from such a plan, drawn from experience in other countries; he proceeds to recommend the writing up the names of streets,—the removal of bulks, and other obstructions,—fixing water trunks against the houses—and points out the manner of constructing kennels, the formation of footways,—regulation of signs, —election of persons to superintend the
<PB N="129" REF="140"/>
pavements,—means of defraying the ex∣pence, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>There were many proposals made about this time for amending the streets; and among the rest, one of Lord Burlington was to pave the carriage-ways throughout, with the largest size, unsquared stones, such as are yet seen to form a few old causeways: The expence of paving the city of West∣minster in this manner, was estimated at two millions sterling.</P>
<P>It is not very easy to convey to a person who has not seen the streets of this metro∣polis before they were uniformly paved, a tolerable idea of their inconvenience and un∣seemliness: The carriage ways were full of cavities, which harboured water and filth The signs extending on both sides the way into the streets, at unequal distances from the houses, that they might not intercept each other, greatly obstructed the view, and, which is of much more consequence
<PB N="130" REF="141"/>
in a crowded city, prevented the free circu∣lation of the air. The foot-paths were uni∣versally incommoded, even where they were so narrow as only to admit of one person passing at a time, by a row of posts, set on the edge next the carriage way. He whose urgent business would not admit of his keep∣ing pace with the gentleman of leisure be∣fore him, turned out between the two posts before the door of some large house into the carriage-way: When he perceived dan∣ger moving towards him, he wished to re∣turn within the protection of the row of posts; but there was commonly a rail con∣tinued from the top of one post to that of another, sometimes for several houses to∣gether; in which case he was obliged to run back to the first inlet, or climb over, or creep under the railing, in attempting which he might think himself fortunate if he escaped with no other injury than what proceeded from dirt: If, intimidated by the
<PB N="131" REF="142"/>
danger he escaped, he afterwards kept within the boundary of the posts and railing, he was obliged to put aside the travellers before him, whose haste was less urgent than his; and these resisting, made his journey truly a <HI>warfare</HI>.</P>
<P>The French are reproached, even to a proverb, for their neglect of the conveni∣ency of foot-passengers in their metropolis, by not providing a separate path for them; but great as is the exposure to dirt in Paris, for want of a foot-way (which their many <HI>portes-cochers</HI> seem likely for ever to prevent) in the more important article of danger, the city of London was, at this period, at least on a par. How comfortless must be the sensations of an unfortunate female, stopped in the street on a windy day, under a large old sign, loaded with lead and iron, in full swing over her head, and per∣haps a torrent of dirty water falling near her, from a projecting spout ornamented
<PB N="132" REF="143"/>
with the mouth and teeth of a dragon! These dangers and distresses are now at an end, and we may think of them as the sailor does of the storm which has subsided; but the advantages derived from the present uniformity and cleanliness of our streets, can be known in their full extent, only by com∣paring them with the former inconveni∣encies.</P>
<P>But however necessary some alteration was thought, no effectual steps were taken at this time; and perhaps the business was at last hastened by an accident which happened, six years after, to the Speaker's carriage, in passing through the narrow en∣trance near Craig's Court.</P>
<P><Q>In 1762, an act passed, appointing Com∣missioners, each of whom should be pos∣sessed of a net income of 300l. per annum, or an estate of 10,000l. value, and vest∣ing authority in them to “order any of the public squares, streets, and lanes, within
<PB N="133" REF="144"/>
the city and liberty of Westminster, and certain parts adjacent, to be paved, raised, altered, cleansed, and lighted, when, and ”in such manner as they should think fit;" and to enter into contracts for paving all or any of such squares, streets, and lanes.</Q> By this act 5,000l. was directed to be issued to the commissioners, out of the supplies granted for the service of the year, towards enabling them to carry the purposes of their commission into execution; and they were further authorized to make a rate, not ex∣ceeding eighteen pence in the pound, of the yearly value of the houses before which their paving should extend. <Q>Their powers being found incomplete, the next year this act was “explained, amended, and ren∣dered ”more effectual" by another; and both these acts "explained and amended" by a third, passed the year after.</Q></P>
<P>Hitherto the commissioners had pursued their plan without much obstruction. The
<PB N="134" REF="145"/>
benefits of the new paving were set in the most conspicuous point of view, by compa∣rison with the inconveniencies of the places not paved; and such confidence had the in∣habitants of several large and opulent streets, in the conduct of the commissioners, that they petitioned them to new pave their streets, and proferred to advance or raise money on the credit of the rates to be made on themselves, to defray the expence, and pay the same to the commissioners; who were to issue the same as the work advanced, and lay <HI>such further rate on the inhabitants, as might be necessary</HI>. To this the commissioners acceded, and in 1765, an act passed to es∣tablish and complete the agreement. <Q>But whatever might be the advantages, the inha∣bitants of these streets, now called “<HI>optional ”streets,"</HI> expected to derive from such a humiliating treaty with the commissioners, their successors have no great reason to vene∣rate their wisdom and foresight:</Q> They
<PB N="135" REF="146"/>
find themselves burthened with a debt im∣mensely large, and rates proportionably high; and have the mortification to see, that if they had waited some months longer, and pursued the plan of the parishes, they would have obtained the substantial advan∣tages of transacting their own business, and had the disposal of that money which now they have only the credit of having raised.</P>
<P>The year after, an act passed to put under the direction of the commissioners, such parts of the road leading from the west end of the town as the new paving was proposed to extend to, and granting them one thou∣sand pounds per annum, to be paid by the trustees of the Kensington road, with au∣thority to raise money on the grant.</P>
<P>But the whole of this business, which is become, by the debt, an object of the most serious consequence to the inhabitants, will be best seen in the abstract:

<P>But the knowledge of the commissioners in the business of paving began now to be thought not so complete as was at first ima∣gined; and it was suspected that advantages had been taken of them by some of their
<PB N="138" REF="149"/>
contractors. The parish of Marybone would not enlist under their banner; but applied to parliament, and obtained a local act, by which they were paved under commissioners of their own nominating, and residing within their own district; and in 1771 the several parishes within the city and liberty of Westminster, and parts adjacent, ob∣tained an act, under which they have com∣pleted what the commissioners had begun, and have in no instance exceeded the rate of eighteen pence in the pound, on the rent of the inhabitants, to answer the joint pur∣poses of paving and repairing; and in the best regulated parishes, a considerable part of the money borrowed has been paid off by a surplus of the rates.</P>
<P>This well-planned act, which is in reality an alteration of a bill presented to parliament by the commissioners, and which lessens, without annihilating, their authority in the parochial pavements, authorizes each parish
<PB N="139" REF="150"/>
to elect three commissioners to represent it in the general commission,—to appoint a committee to superintend its own business, —to borrow money for themselves at as low a rate of interest as they can,—and to make a rate, five-sixth parts whereof to be ap∣propriated to pay the interest of the money borrowed, and the remaining sixth part to lie by, and accumulate towards paying off the principal; which, in the best managed parishes, they will be able completely to do in a very few years.</P>
<P>This is the short history of an undertak∣ing, which has introduced a degree of ele∣gance and symmetry into the streets of the metropolis, that is the admiration of all Europe, and far exceeds any thing of the kind in the modern world. Mr. Hanway, whose hints and observations on the original plan were almost all adopted, attended closely to the business until the plan was formed, and in some measure carried into execution;
<PB N="140" REF="151"/>
but when he saw that the great objects of health, cleanliness, and safety, were provided for, and that the citizens of London had come to a resolution to adopt the new mode of paving; he directed his humane attention where he thought it would be of more gene∣ral service.</P>
<P>EARLY in the spring of this year, 1755, intelligence was received that the French, with whom the war was now grown serious, were fitting out a formidable squadron of ships at Brest, and had actually begun to assemble a body of forces, with intention to make a descent on this kingdom. This fil∣led people's minds with consternation. The six thousand men stipulated to be furnished by the States General, whenever England should be threatened with invasion, were demanded and refused, and the panick in∣creased. At this period Mr. Hanway pub∣lished his <HI>"Thoughts on Invasion,"</HI> intended
<PB N="141" REF="152"/>
to quiet the minds of the people, as to the probability of the event taking place, and the means which they had, if exerted properly, to repel their enemies if they should dare to land on their coast.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MARINE SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next object of general benevolence, which engaged his attention, was the en∣couragement of the breed of seamen. The act of the second of Queen Anne, which directs every master of a vessel of thirty tons burthen and upwards, to take one or more apprentice or apprentices from the parish, was so much neglected as to be of little use, and the war, which had now commenced, made it apparent that some effectual regula∣tion was necessary. He at first endeavoured, by sundry printed letters, addressed to the masters in the merchants service, to persuade
<PB N="142" REF="153"/>
them to comply with the directions of the act; but the single voice of an individual was too feeble to be heard where interest was concerned. When once, however, he had engaged in any thing he thought right, he never remitted in his exertions till he had carried his point: Opposition served but to increase his industry; and his zealous ap∣plication to remedy this neglect of a wise and considerate act of parliament, produced in the end the MARINE SOCIETY, an insti∣tution not to be equalled for substantial uti∣lity, and real national advantage, by any undertaking in any age or country.</P>
<P>In March 1756, Fowler Walker, Esq. a barrister at law, first proposed to the late Sir John Fielding, then John Fielding, Esq. to collect such vagabond boys as either were brought before him in his capacity of a ma∣gistrate, charged with petty offences, or were found wandering and begging in the streets, and solicit a subscription for fitting them
<PB N="143" REF="154"/>
out to serve at sea; and Mr. Fielding, with the assistance of Mr. Walker, succeeded so far as to obtain sufficient to clothe and fit out about four hundred poor boys.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway considering that the war would call for a greater number of seamen than at that time existed, and that something was necessary to be done, before the boys could attain to the age and strength of man∣hood, summoned a meeting of merchants, and owners of ships, to be held at a coffee-house near the Royal Exchange, and there proposed to them to form themselves into a society for fitting out landmen-volunteers and boys, to serve on board the king's ships. The proposal was eagerly embraced; a re∣gular society was formed, and a committee and proper officers appointed. July the 15th following, the first ten landmen were delivered properly clothed on board a king's ship, and the society, under the direction
<PB N="144" REF="155"/>
of Mr. Hanway, proceeded in their enter∣prize with great vigour and perseverance.</P>
<P>At this time Admiral Boscawen wrote a letter to Mr. Hanway, of which the fol∣lowing is an extract. <Q>“It is with great pleasure that I see your labours for the good of the public brought to maturity; for I will venture to say, no <HI>scheme</HI> for manning the navy, within my knowledge, has ever had the success of the <HI>Marine Society</HI>: I have seen many of the men and boys you have sent, who I am sure will be∣come useful members of society, who would ”otherwise have been lost to the nation."</Q></P>
<P>"We found, says Mr. Hanway, in his address to the public in favour of the design, a great number of young fellows, in danger of becoming a prey to vice through idleness, who, as soon as the garb of seamen was pre∣sented to them gratis, gladly entered into the service; and a number of boys loitering in filth and rags, and as the forlorn hope of human
<PB N="145" REF="156"/>
nature, ready for any enterprize; and we con∣sidered that the preserving such persons, and rendering them useful, promoted the great end of government and true policy, in a double view."</P>
<P>In December 1757, a silver anchor was voted to Mr. Walker, and another to Mr. Hanway, by the society; the latter inscribed, <Q>“As a token of the high sense we entertain of his public spirit, in proposing, and his un∣wearied assiduity in methodising and carrying ”our design into execution;" <HI>and the plan was found so beneficial, that it met with general encouragement</HI>.</Q></P>

<PB N="147" REF="158"/>
conditions contributed with generosity suited to their respective abilities.</P>
<P>When the idle boys and men in and near the metropolis were sent to sea, the society directed their attention to Scotland and Ire∣land, and in 1762, six years after its com∣mencement, the governors had fitted out,

<P>The navy regulations require, that for every hundred men employed in actual ser∣vice, four boys should be entered, and very near all this proportion of boys were clothed and sent by the Marine Society.</P>
<P>Towards the end of the war, the society, fearing that many of the boys fitted out by them, might be turned loose on the world again, and fall into mischief; applied to the Lords of the Admiralty, and obtained of them an
<PB N="148" REF="159"/>
order, that each boy discharged should be victualled on board ships in ordinary for a time not exceeding three months, and in his discharge have a certificate from the com∣mander under whom he served; but it ap∣peared that so many of them had become seamen, and procured employment on board merchant ships, or had obtained work on shore, that when the society offered relief to all who had been fitted out by them, and might be in want, only about four hundred applied for assistance.</P>
<P>In 1763, Mr. William Hicks, a mer∣chant of Hamburgh, who had no near re∣lation, and who had shewn a friend∣ship for Mr. Hanway while he was at that place, left in his will the sum of twenty-two thousand pounds to the society; but directed that in times of peace half of the produce of his bequest should be appropriated in placing out poor girls apprentice.</P>
<P><Q>By the words of Mr. Hicks's will, the
<PB N="149" REF="160"/>
money bequeathed was directed to be “laid out in secure land, the produce to be ap∣plied to the use of the Marine Society in ”London."</Q> This wording was supposed, by some lawyers, to bring the bequest with∣in the statute of Mortmain, although the testator lived out of the jurisdiction of the realms. The heir at law was a butcher's daughter in Hertfordshire, of very remote relationship; and although a deed of com∣promise was offered by the society to take eight-twentieths of the bequest immediately, and three-twentieths more at the death of the heir at law, it was not till May, 1769, that the final division of the legacy was made.</P>
<P>In 1772, an act of parliament passed to make the governors a body corporate, under the style of the <HI>"Marine Society,"</HI> and ap∣pointing Robert Lord Romney, President; John Thornton, Esq. Treasurer; and a cer∣tain number of the governors, a committee
<PB N="150" REF="161"/>
for transacting the general business; a do∣nation of twelve guineas to qualify the donor to be elected a governor for life, and a subscription of two guineas for one year.</P>
<P>The office rented by the governors over part of the Royal Exchange being found in∣convenient, in 1774 a subscription was entered into for building a house with apartments for their business; a piece of ground adjoining St. Ethelburga's church in Bishopsgate-street, was taken on a build∣ing lease of the committee for city lands, and a very ample and proper house was erected, where the business of the society has ever since been carried on. This house cost near four thousand pounds. The court room is sitted up, and decorated in a very elegant manner. Captain Thomas Hanway, having in his life time been one of the earliest supporters, his brother gave a chamber mausoleum erected to his memory to the
<PB N="151" REF="162"/>
society, and it now forms a distinguished part of the ornaments of this court room.</P>
<P>At the top of the stairs, on the south side of the Royal Exchange (where the business of the society was at first carried on), is erected a small statue, cast in metal, repre∣senting charity protecting a distressed boy, with a suitable inscription on the pedestal. This was the gift of Thomas Nash, of Lon∣don, grocer, one of the earliest patrons of the society, who was afterwards Lord Mayor; and a copy of this group is placed at the front of the society's present house in Bishopsgate street.</P>
<P>I cannot take my leave of this excellent and truly patriotic institution, without ex∣pressing my approbation, however unim∣portant, of the principle on which it is founded, and my sincerest wish that it may still increase in splendour, and be as a foun∣tain, from whence shall stow the blessings of industry, emulation, and true Christian
<PB N="152" REF="163"/>
bravery to all parts of the British empire. Against every institution of a charitable na∣ture, except this, at some time or other objections have been made; but the Ma∣rine Society has the peculiar felicity to receive the concurrent applause of all man∣kind. The invisible link with which, for wise purposes, Heaven attaches the parent to its own offspring, is here not weakened; the child is not separated from his natural parents till the time, when nature seems to decree, that he should labour for his own support, and assume a distinct character, dependant on his own exertions and recti∣tude of conduct. What plan can be possibly devised more substantially beneficial than that which relieves distress, without encou∣raging idleness; which checks the career of dissipation and vice, without sacrificing the agent, and transforms the most useless and dangerous part of the community into the most useful and truly respectable?</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="164"/>Mr. Hanway had not only the merit of being the original proposer of this design; but by the most judicious and unceasing at∣tention to its interest, and the management of its finances, deserved the title of its guardian also: He led it as it were by the hand, dur∣ing its infant state; and protected and watched over it, with the care of a parent, till it arrived by degrees to the strength and maturity it at present enjoys.</P>
<P>In 1757, Mr. Hanway published his "Journey from Portsmouth to Kingston," which running through two editions, in the last he animadverted on the pernicious cus∣tom of tea-drinking, and the expence it created to the lower classes of the people. Doctor Johnson, to whom this liquor was extremely grateful, and who applied to it
<PB N="154" REF="165"/>
when his spirits wanted recruit, as others apply to a cordial, was at that time engaged in a periodical work, called <Q>“The Literary ”Magazine."</Q> Stirred up by this attack on his favourite beverage, the Doctor conde∣scended to stoop from that dignity of cha∣racter, which he was so peculiarly qualified to support, and in an <HI>anonymous</HI> essay inserted in his work, without answering the remarks made by our author, attacked him in his personal character, in a style between irony and ill-nature. The Doctor, in his warmth, perceived not that Mr. Hanway's remarks were not intended for people in his line of life, and by this essay convinced their mutual friends, that he was not more superior to his adversary in learning, than inferior to him in affability and social benevolence.</P>

<HEAD>FOUNDLING HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1758, Mr. Hanway paid fifty pounds to qualify him as a governor of the Found∣ling Hospital for life, and with his usual earnestness set himself to acquire a know∣ledge of the state of the institution, and to consider how his assistance and advice might be best directed for its advancement. Of the rise and progress of this house of refuge for deserted children, the following is the best account I have been able to procure.</P>
<P><Q>In 1708, some merchants of London associated themselves together, and proposed to open a subscription, and erect a house for the reception of <HI>such infants as the mis∣fortunes or inhumanity of their parents should leave destitute of support</HI>; for it was found that, “the officers, whom the laws had charged with the care of the poor, had
<PB N="156" REF="167"/>
been so negligent, that some infants had been suffered to perish with cold and hunger in the streets, without any attempt ”for their relief."</Q></P>
<P><Q>This humane proposal was not, however, carried into execution at this time; the rea∣son assigned, being the fear “<HI>that it might seem to encourage vice, by making too easy a pro∣vision ”for illegitimate children."</HI></Q> But though the merchants proceeded no further, yet their publications seem to have evinced the ne∣cessity of a Foundling Hospital; and the idea was so warmly cherished, that several persons left money by will to be ap∣propriated to such an hospital when it should be erected.</P>
<P>The first man who took up the business in a regular manner, was <HI>Mr. Thomas Co∣ram</HI>, commander of a vessel in the merchants service. <Q>In his introductory address, he said, “he had been a witness to the shock∣ing spectacle of innocent children, who
<PB N="$$$" REF="168"/>
had been murdered and thrown upon ”dunghills."</Q> His first intention was to erect huts in Lamb's Conduit fields, for the reception and nourishment of deserted in∣fants; but meeting with greater encourage∣ment than he expected, he applied to some persons of distinction of the softer sex, by whom he judiciously concluded his repre∣sentation would be most sensibly felt, and obtained a declaration signed by twenty-one noble ladies, of which the following is an abstract:</P>
<P><Q>“Whereas among the institutions of cha∣rity, which this nation, and especially the city of London, has hitherto established, no expedient has yet been found out for preventing the frequent <HI>murders</HI> of poor infants at their birth; or for suppressing the inhuman custom of exposing new∣born infants to perish in the streets: For a beginning to redress so deplorable a grievance, We, whose names are under∣written,
<PB N="158" REF="169"/>
being deeply touched with com∣passion, for the sufferings and lamentable condition of such poor, abandoned, help∣less infants, and in order to supply the government with useful hands, and for the better producing of good and faithful servants from amongst the poor; <HI>are de∣sirous</HI> to encourage, and willing to con∣tribute towards erecting an hospital for infants, whom their <HI>parents are not able to maintain</HI>, which we conceive will not only prevent many <HI>horrid murders, cruel∣ties</HI>, and other mischiefs, and be greatly beneficial to the public; but will also be acceptable to God Almighty, as being the only remedy of such great evils, which have been so long neglected, though al∣ways complained of: Provided a Royal Charter be granted by the King, to such persons as shall be willing to become be∣nefactors for the erecting and endowing such an hospital, and managing the affairs
<PB N="159" REF="170"/>
thereof gratis; under such regulations as his Majesty, in his great wisdom, shall judge most proper, for attaining the de∣sired ”effect of our good intentions."</Q></P>

<P>Names like these could not fail of suc∣ceeding. The address was annexed to the petition to the king for a charter, which was immediately granted, and bears date the seventeenth of October, 1739. The next year an act of parliament passed to confirm and enlarge the powers granted by
<PB N="160" REF="171"/>
the charter, and the guardians purchased land of the Earl of Salisbury, in Lamb's Conduit fields, whereon to erect the pro∣posed hospital. But willing to attempt something before the building could be com∣pleted, they hired a house in Hatton Gar∣den, and in March, 1741, the first thirty children were admitted. During that year one hundred and thirty-six were received under the care of the guardians, of whom sixty-six died, which determined the go∣vernors to send their children to be nursed out of the impure air of the metropolis.</P>
<P>On the sixteenth of September, 1742, the first stone of the present building was laid; but it was three years before one wing was ready to be inhabited, and then the house in Hatton Garden was given up.</P>

the other wing was added. Such was the zeal which influenced the minds of persons for this favourite object, that perhaps no institution merely of a charitable nature was ever more munificently supported.</P>
<P>The King gave two thousand pounds, and one thousand more towards establishing a preacher. The Princess Dowager of Wales seven hundred and forty pounds; and before 1769, upwards of ten thousand pounds had been collected at musical performances in the chapel, under the direction of Mr. Handel, who gave an organ for the chapel, and the score of his Messiah to the guardians.</P>
<P><Q>In 1755, the House of Commons took up the cause of the hospital, and at the solici∣tation of the guardians, Resolved that, “to render the hospital of general utility, all the children which should be offered un∣der a certain age should be admitted, and proper places opened in all the counties
<PB N="162" REF="173"/>
of the kingdom for the reception of ex∣posed ”and deserted young children."</Q></P>
<P><Q>In June following, the guardians having received their first grant from parliament of ten thousand pounds, opened their doors to receive “all children not exceeding two ”months old, which should be offered."</Q> The first day of this indiscriminate admission, one hundred and seventeen children were admitted. The next year thirty thousand pounds more was granted, and the guardians extended the age of admission from two to six months. At the end of 1757, 5618 infants had been received, of whom had died 2311. Parliament continued their assistance with a most liberal hand; the money grant∣ed between the year 1755, and 1771, when all public support was withdrawn, being upwards of five hundred and seventy thou∣sand pounds—thirty-three thousand five hundred and thirty pounds per ann. on an average.</P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="174"/><Q>A receptacle so supported, with its doors continually open, and governed by persons of sentiment, could not want applications, too many of which were dictated rather by a want of feeling in the parent for its off∣spring, than of the means of rearing it; and in a little while the governors found it necessary to advertise, that they “would prosecute <HI>all persons, as well parish-officers as others, who should forcibly or fraudulently send to the hospital any children without the ”consent of their parents,"</HI> and actually to prosecute in several instances.</Q></P>
<P>It was supposed by some of the most sanguine of the guardians, that the hospital would in time supersede the necessity of the poor laws; but others were not deceived by this torrent of apparent humanity: These saw that the universal admission had a ten∣dency to promote licentiousness, by weak∣ening the force of that first passion of nature, the attachment of the parent to her own off∣spring.
<PB N="164" REF="175"/>
The foremost of these advocates for morality was Mr. Hanway: He ob∣served that the Foundling children, contrary to expectation, were not less viciously in∣clined, than those bred in a populous city, and that to take infants from their parents, and send them into a world, in which there was not one person to whom they owed a particular obedience, or whose opinion or censure it was incumbent on them to regard, was not the way to promote virtue, and the harmony of society. In 1759, he publish∣ed a pamphlet expressly to point out to the guardians and the world, the evil tendency which the practice must have, especially as these children were not intended to serve the king, in the capacity of soldiers, or sailors, as in France, and some other countries hav∣ing foundling hospitals. The wealth, how∣ever, which rolled in from government every session, carried every thing before it, and the indiscriminate admission of all child∣ren,
<PB N="165" REF="176"/>
without question, continued some years longer; but Mr. Hanway was not dazzled by this false splendour, nor intimidated by the opposition of those who, benefited by the plan, or fond of the disposal of public money, took up its defence. He never quitted the subject till he had gained his point; and time has shewn mankind that he was right.</P>
<P>In 1771, parliament not perceiving such great public benefit to arise from the hospital as had been expected, withdrew all support, and the governors came to a resolution to admit only such a number of children as their finances were adequate to the main∣tenance of, and these monthly by ballot.</P>
<P>Whether a foundling hospital is an institu∣tion proper for this kingdom, the only one in the world where there is an universal tax for the support of the indigent, is not for me to determine; but I should conceive that some salutary regulations might have been borrowed
<PB N="166" REF="177"/>
from the foundling hospitals of other coun∣tries. Among the rules of L'Hopital des En∣fans-Trouvés of Paris, I find the following: <Q>“Les autres Enfans (those not intended for the king's service), lorsqu'ils auront at∣teint l'âge de six ans, seront confiés aux Bourgeois, Laboureurs, Marchands, ou Artisans, qui les demanderont pour les élever jusqu'à l'âge de vingt-cinq ans. Il sera payé par an, par forme de pension, pour chaque Enfant; sçavoir, pour les Garçons 40 livres jusqu'à douze ans, et 30 livres depuis l'âge de douze jusqu'à quatorze accomplis: et à l'égard des Filles, il sera aussi payé 40 livres par an jusqu'à l'âge de seize ans accomplis; étant présumable que les Garçons parvenus à quartorze ans, et les Filles à seize ans, se∣ront alors en état d'être utiles à ceux qui s'en chargeront, et ausquels tous lesdits Enfans seront soumis, et rendront l'obéis∣sance, comme les Enfans la doivent à
<PB N="167" REF="178"/>
”leurs Peres et Meres."</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The other children, as soon as they attain the age of six years, are placed with labourers, tradesmen, or handicrafts, who apply for them, to be brought up till they arrive at the age of twenty-five. The masters are paid an annual sum, by way of pension, for each child, viz. For the boys, forty livres till they are twelve years old, and thirty livres from twelve to fourteen; for the girls, forty livres per ann. till they reach sixteen years; it being presumed that the boys at fourteen, and the girls at sixteen, will be useful to those who have the charge of them, to whom they are required to be obe∣dient as to their parents.</NOTE> Would not such a mode have been of service here, when the guardians of this hospital were so able to adopt and support it?</P>
<P>Lord Kaimes, in the violence of his re∣sentment, would have every foundation of the kind "rased to the ground," and proceeds so far as to reprobate our poor laws in toto; but then he is constrained to leave the unfortunate to the uncertain assistance of voluntary compassion; a precarious support, more frequently extorted by the
<PB N="168" REF="179"/>
clamorous, than bestowed on the meek and deserving.</P>
<P>With respect to the hospital receiving pa∣rish infants to be paid for; this was a fa∣vourite object of Mr. Hanway, and pro∣moted at first with all his might; but the reason on which he founded its propriety is now done away, and the practice is almost at an end. The hospital nurses certainly preserved the lives of many infants, who, if a judgment is to be drawn from general experience, would have died in the work∣houses; but thanks to this generous and penetrating friend of mankind, parish poor infants in the metropolis are no longer the victims of the foul air of a workhouse; for they are all obliged to be nursed out of town, as I shall have occasion to mention particularly hereafter.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="169" REF="180"/>
<HEAD>MAGDALENE HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<P>THE next object of Mr. Hanway's philanthropy, was to provide an asylum for the women of the town. In all the coun∣tries through which he had travelled, the promiscuous commerce of the sexes was either expressly or tacitly allowed; but then it was confined to particular quarters of the city, and was therefore less open to general observation than here. His feeling heart could not but deplore the wretched situation of so many beautiful females, who wandered publicly whithersoever inclination or necessity led them, and obtruded their mi∣sery and their vice on his eye in every street.</P>
<P>As early as 1750, when he first arrived from St. Petersburgh, Mr. Robert Dingley
<PB N="170" REF="181"/>
communicated to him his plan for a Magda∣lene house; but Mr. Hanway advised him not to make it public till some previous ob∣servations had more fully evinced the use∣fulness of such a design.</P>
<P>One of the first appeals to the humanity of the public in behalf of these miserable beings, was made by Dr. Samuel Johnson. Struck with the sight of the hospital for the reception of deserted infants, a natural train of sentiment led him to reflect on the fate of their mothers; whom he thus recommends to a place in the heart of the benevolent.</P>
<P><Q>“These were all once, if not virtuous, at least innocent, and might still have continued blameless and easy, but for the arts and insinuations of those whose rank, fortune, or education furnished them with means to corrupt or to delude them. Let the libertine reflect a moment on the situation of that woman, who, be∣ing forsaken by her betrayer, is reduced
<PB N="171" REF="182"/>
to the necessity of turning prostitute for bread, and judge of the enormity of his ”guilt, by the evils which it produces.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“It cannot be doubted but that numbers follow this dreadful course of life with shame, horror, and regret; but where can they hope for refuge? <HI>The world is not their friend, nor the world's law.</HI> Their sighs, and tears, and groans, are criminal in the eye of their tyrants, the bully and the bawd, who fatten on their misery, and threaten them with want or a gaol, if they shew the least design of escaping ”from their bondage.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“How frequently have the gay and thoughtless, in their evening frolicks, seen a band of these miserable females, co∣vered with rags, shivering with cold, and pining with hunger, and without either pitying their calamities, or rerflecting up∣on the cruelty of those, who perhaps first seduced them by caresses of fondness, or
<PB N="172" REF="183"/>
magnificence of promises, go on to reduce others to the same wretchedness by the ”same means!</Q></P>
<P><Q>“To stop the increase of this deplorable multitude, is undoubtedly the first and most pressing consideration. To prevent evil is the great end of government, the end for which vigilance and severity are properly employed. But surely those, whom passion or interest have already de∣praved, have some claim to compassion, from beings equally frail and fallible with themselves; nor will they long groan in their present afflictions, if none were to refuse them relief, but those that owe their exemption from the same distress only to ”their wisdom and their virtue.</Q></P>
<P>"March 26, 1751."</P>
<P>Several other persons, particularly Mr. John Fielding, and Mr. Saunders Welch, endeavoured to excite the commiseration of the public for these pitiable objects; but it
<PB N="173" REF="184"/>
was not till the year 1758, that any regular proposal was made for their relief. In this year Mr. Dingley first offered to the public his <Q>“<HI>Proposal for establishing a Place of Re∣ception ”for penitent Prostitutes,"</HI> which he prefaced with an address feelingly descrip∣tive of their misery, and their incapacity to extricate themselves from it by any efforts of their own.</Q> This proposal Mr. Hanway recommended by a pamphlet and several letters, previously prepared; and it met with the approbation of many respectable charac∣ters. The plan, as originally concerted, was intended to include orphan girls of a tender age; but this part was abandoned for the present, though it now makes a distinguished figure among our charitable institutions.</P>
<P>Encouraged by the support they had ex∣perienced, a committee was formed of the following persons:

Who undertook to account for the subscrip∣tions, which in a few weeks amounted to three thousand pounds. They took a house in Prescot-street, Goodman's Fields, and on the tenth of August, 1758, the first eight women were received.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway continued to recommend the design by all the means in his power, and procured the best accounts he could of the institutions of a similar kind in other countries, particularly that of Rome, founded so early as the year 626, dedicated to Mary Magdalene; that of Naples, in 1324; of Seville, in 1550; and of Amsterdam, in 1596. After a trial of some years, the governors built their present hospital in St. George's Fields.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="186"/>Her Majesty condescended to be the pa∣troness, and gave three hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The number of women admitted from its commencement to the year 1786, is two thousand four hundred and fifteen, of whom one thousand five hundred and seventy-one have been reconciled to their friends, or placed out in service; many of these have since married, and are mothers of families; the rest have died, proved refractory, or been discharged at their own desire, unable to bear the restraint. There are now sixty women in the hospital.</P>
<P>It is an unfavourable circumstance to this institution, that for obvious reasons the go∣vernors cannot make public the particular instances in which their endeavours have been attended with the desired success; and some persons, seeing the numbers of the wo∣men of the town still so prodigious, are led from thence to think less highly of the hospital than it deserves. The governors
<PB N="176" REF="187"/>
never hoped to be able completely to eradi∣cate vice; but they have been the means of restoring many to virtue, happiness, and health, who must, without their assistance, have been lost.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway took great delight in en∣tertaining the women who had left the hospital and settled in life, at his own house; he encouraged their visits, inquired their manner of life and gave them his good advice, and, to shew his sincerity, always accompanied it with a small present.</P>
<P>IN 1759, Mr. Hanway published his <Q>“Reasons for an additional Number of twelve thousand Seamen to be employed in Time of ”Peace, in the Merchants Service."</Q> The design of this work, which was promoted by Admiral Boscawen, and other persons of distinction in the maritime line, was to
<PB N="177" REF="188"/>
prove, that as a commercial and military nation, having such remote and extended dominions, our trade ought to contribute more to its own existence and support; and that to have a resource of seamen always ready to act, whenever our enemies should make it necessary, would prevent the ex∣pence and inconvenience of pressing, and set us on equal terms with our foes, even on the first breaking out of hostilities. The manner in which he proposed to form and support this augmentation of seamen, was by compelling masters in the merchants service to take an additional number of sailors, in proportion to the tonnage of their vessels, and allowing bounties on certain articles of com∣merce, as an equivalent to the additional number of hands.</P>
<P>The encouragement of seamen was al∣ways a favourite object of our author's at∣tention; and he knew from experience as well as observation, how much the safety
<PB N="178" REF="189"/>
and prosperity of our country depend on this useful body of men. He saw likewise that it required a long time to convert a mere landman into a tolerable mariner; and such was his attachment to this favourite plan, and his confidence of its expediency, that he never lost sight of it: In 1770, he published a second edition of the above work: At the close of the last war he endeavoured to make the marine society contribute towards the breed of seamen, by education as well as clothing; and I have heard him say, with great regret, <Q>“I fear I shall not carry my object, and yet the most popular ob∣jection I find is, that the practice is an imitation of our neighbours the French; as if we were bound to imitate them only in the cut of a coat, or the shape of a ”hat!"</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<PB N="179" REF="190"/>
<HEAD>STEPNEY SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1758, Mr. Hanway entered his name as a subscriber to the <HI>Stepney Society</HI>, an institution calculated to prevent misery, and encourage maritime employment; and which, though it has lately declined, deserves well to be recorded.</P>
<P>In the year 1674, at the conclusion of the war with Holland, a few masters of ships in the merchants service entered into a small subscription to be appropriated for the <Q>“<HI>Apprenticing out Orphans, and the ”Children of the Poor to Marine Trades;"</HI> but either for want of a person at their head, who had abilities to conduct a plan of the kind, or some other cause not now to be easily traced out, very little was done; and the society was not much known till the
<PB N="180" REF="191"/>
year 1729, when Sir Charles Wager ac∣cepted the office of steward.</Q> The patronage of this brave and benevolent man greatly assisted the society, and afterwards persons of the highest rank and fortune were stew∣ards. The lords of the Admiralty, commis∣sioners of the Navy, and Victualling, and other departments of the marine gave their countenance and support to it.</P>
<P>Previous to the year 1758, the society had usually placed out sixteen boys as apprentices, chiefly to water-borne businesses, every year, with each of whom they gave five pounds apprentice fee; but their finances were too slender to enable them to do any thing for the instruction or comfort of the lads in their apprenticeship. It is remarkable that from the commencement of this fraternity to the time when Mr. Hanway became a steward, almost their whole fund had been collected at their annual feast. The masters, probably, struck out the idea originally at
<PB N="181" REF="192"/>
a dinner, and in the benevolence of their hearts, continued to dine, and to contribute once in the course of every year for so long a period. Their names, I believe, never appeared; the stewards were annually ap∣pointed to provide the dinner, and see to the distribution of the money collected. It had been usual to appropriate a part of their little fund to the clothing a few boys to serve as volunteers on board the king's ships; but Mr. Hanway perceiving that the ma∣rine society made such ample provision for all boys inclined to serve in the navy, pre∣vailed on his colleagues to appropriate the whole to the original purpose of apprentic∣ing out boys in the mercantile and trading departments. He likewise obtained a prefer∣ence to be given to the parent who was burthened with a large family: The <HI>Jus trium Liberorum</HI> of the Romans (which I apprehend was originally a Lacedemonian institution) was always a favourite law with
<PB N="182" REF="193"/>
him; although he himself had never any children.</P>
<P>IN this same year, 1759, he promoted a subscription for furnishing the British troops serving in Germany and America, with useful articles of clothing, &amp;c. suitable to the climates they were in. A part of the subscription, which amounted in the whole to seven thousand four hundred and six pounds, was reserved for the relief of the widows and orphans of such as were slain or died in the service; and this kind token of the attention, which their countrymen paid to the soldiers, contributed much to animate them in the transactions of this year, so glorious to the English nation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>VAILS GIVING.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT this time Mr. Hanway set himself to oppose the absurd custom of
<PB N="183" REF="194"/>
<HI>Vails Giving</HI>, which had arrived at a very extravagant pitch, especially among the ser∣vants of the great, and was detrimental to the rich as well as the poor. The man of power and influence must lose much of the pleasure of life, if he is deprived of the society of those whose science enables them to instruct or amuse, but whose circum∣stances prevent them from communicating their knowledge at a repeated expence to themselves. It was Mr. Hanway who an∣swered the kind reproach of a friend in a high station for not coming oftener to dine with him, by saying, <Q>“Indeed I cannot ”afford it."</Q></P>
<P>In 1762, he published <Q>“Eight Let∣ters ”to the Duke of —," <HI>on this custom</HI>.</Q> The nobleman here meant was the Duke of Newcastle. The letters are written in that humorous style, which is most attractive of general notice, and was best adapted to the subject. If I am not mistaken, it was Sir Timothy Waldo that
<PB N="184" REF="195"/>
first put him on this plan: Sir Timothy had dined with the Duke of N——, and on his leaving the house, was contri∣buting to the support and insolence of a train of servants who lined the hall; and at last put a crown into the hand of the Cook, who returned it, saying, <Q>“Sir, I do not ”take silver"—<HI>Don't you indeed?</HI></Q> said the worthy Baronet, putting it in his pocket, <HI>then I do not give gold</HI>. Among the ludi∣crous circumstances in Mr. Hanway's letters, is one which happened to himself. He was paying the servants of a respectable friend for a dinner, which their master had invited him to, one by one as they appeared: <Q>“Sir, your great coat:" <HI>a shilling</HI>—"Your hat:" <HI>a shilling</HI>—"Stick:" shilling—"Um∣brella:" ”<HI>shilling</HI>—"Sir, your gloves:"</Q> <HI>Why, friend, you may keep the gloves; they are not worth a shilling.</HI></P>
<P>By degrees this odious custom became less fashionable, and it received its last stroke
<PB N="185" REF="196"/>
from Mr. Dodsl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s excellent farce of High Life below Stairs, which exposed to the great, a part of their domestic oeconomy that they had not before examined. But, banished from the mansions of the great, it seems to be gaining ground among the mid∣dling classes; and the married will, I hope, not think themselves neglected by their single acquaintances, whilst these can dine at the coffee-house or their own homes, at a cheaper rate than with their friends, and at the same time have the privilege of con∣sulting their own appetites.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>PRESERVATION OF INFANT PARISH POOR.</HEAD>
<P>THE progression that I had laid down for myself in this relation, and which, though irregular, was the most intelligible that I could form, now brings me to an in∣stance
<PB N="186" REF="197"/>
of Mr. Hanway's perseverance and philanthropy, the most arduous and splendid of all his public undertakings. I mean the <HI>Preservation of the Lives of the infant Parish Poor, within the Bills of Mortality</HI>. It was not supported by a subscription, the publi∣cation of which encourages an increase of benefactors, and adds to the self-compla∣cency attendant on a charitable act, the justifiable reflection that it will be made known. Alone and unassisted, he explored the then miserable and unhealthy habitations of the parish poor in these crowded cities, exposed his tender lungs to the pestilential air of the workhouse sick-wards, and pro∣cured a complete account of the interior management of every workhouse in and near the metropolis. I feel myself incapable of doing justice to his labours in this work, or of expressing my own ideas of its excel∣lence; they only can form an adequate idea of it, who have had opportunities of
<PB N="187" REF="198"/>
knowing what devastation was made in the lives of parish infants before he exerted himself in their behalf, and comparing it with the present improved practice.</P>
<P>In the journey which he had taken to Paris, and through Holland, he had visited all the houses for the reception of the poor, particularly those of Paris, and the found∣ling hospitals of France, and noted what∣ever he thought might be adopted here with advantage. From the year 1757 to 1762, his principal employment was visiting the workhouses in these cities; and as he found it impossible to work a complete reform all at once, he confined his attention to in∣fants. He published his observations as they were made, in the hope of engaging his fellow citizens in the cause; but his accounts were so melancholy, that they were gene∣rally disbelieved: To enforce credit he ha∣zarded making a host of enemies, and pub∣lished all the particulars of the facts he had
<PB N="188" REF="199"/>
stated, giving the names of every parish of∣ficer, whatever was his rank in life, under whose hands many infants had died by neg∣lect.</P>
<P>During the year 1765, in the workhouse of St. Clement Danes, one nurse, Mary Poole, had twenty-three children committed to her care, and on the twenty-fifth of January 1766, eighteen were dead, two had been discharged, and three only remained alive.</P>
<P>Of seventy-eight children received into the workhouse of the united parishes of St. Andrew, and St. George, Holborn, in the year 1765, sixty-four were dead before 1766.</P>
<P>Of forty-eight received into the work∣house of St. Luke, Middlesex, in 1764, for nurture, died within the year, thirty-seven.</P>
<P>Of nineteen received into the workhouse of St. George, Middlesex, in 1765, died before 1766, sixteen.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200"/>In some popular parishes, not one child was living, of all that were received, in the course of twelve months.</P>
<P>These are a few of the alarming instances of the mortality of infants, which Mr. Hanway traced out. Wherever his gene∣ral statements were disputed, he published a certificate signed with his name, mention∣ing the name of each particular infant, the day of its birth or admission, the time it lived, and the name of its nurse.</P>
<P>He likewise made a journey through the greatest part of England, to compare the mortality in the country workhouses with that of the metropolis, and was convinced that the greater proportion of deaths in these cities, was owing to the air of the work∣houses being too consined and impure for the lungs of new-born infants. His next effort was to get all parish infants sent to the Foundling Hospital, and a great many were put under the care of the guardians, and
<PB N="190" REF="201"/>
preserved. He had obtained an act of par∣liament in 1761, obliging every London parish to keep an annual register of all the infants received, discharged, and dead; and from these registers, which were directed to be published yearly by the company of pa∣rish clerks, he selected, from time to time, every thing that could tend to convince the public of the necessity of an alteration. He stemmed every opposition by stating facts, and at length in 1766, after a perseverance hardly to be equalled, by his own exertions, and at his own sole expence, he obtained an act, 7. Geo. III. cap. 39, which directs, that, <HI>all Parish Infants belonging to the Parishes within the Bills of Mortality, shall not be nursed in the Workhouses, but be sent to nurse a certain Number of Miles out of Town, until they are six Years old, under the Care of Guardians, to be elected triennially, for the express Purpose of tak∣ing Care of them</HI>. This statute likewise autho∣rizes parish officers within the bills of morta∣lity,
<PB N="191" REF="202"/>
to bind their male apprentices till they at∣tain the age of twenty-one years, instead of twenty-four, as required by the former laws, a privilege which has been since extended to the kingdom at large.</P>
<P>If I were to state the number of infants, whose lives appeared, by the registers of the next five years, to have been preserved by this act, or which are now preserved annually by it, I should, most probably, be disbe∣lieved. <Q>The poor called it “the act for ”keeping children alive;" and thousands now living may impute their existence to the judicious interference of this good and sensible man.</Q> I think I now see him going from one workhouse to another in the morning, and from one member of parlia∣ment to another in the afternoon, for day after day, and year after year, with steady and unwearied patience, enduring every re∣buff, answering every objection, and accom∣modating himself to every humour for the
<PB N="192" REF="203"/>
furtherance of his benevolent design, which he established at last, almost without as∣sistance. Among the various instances of neglect, which came to his notice in the course of this enterprize, I cannot but men∣tion one: He observed that a certain overseer refused to allow the mother of a new-born infant more than one shilling and six-pence a week for nursing it, and remarked to him, that this pittance was less than he gave to strange nurses. <Q>"Yes," says the conscien∣tious officer, “but you don't consider that this woman will take care of her own child, and it may be on our hands a long time, whereas we shall, perhaps, hear no ”more of the other!"</Q></P>
<P>The many useful and public spirited plans which Mr. Hanway had promoted, for the welfare of his fellow creatures, had now
<PB N="193" REF="204"/>
rendered his character most respectably po∣pular. His disinterestedness, and the sincerity of his intentions were conspicuous to all. His name appeared to every proposal for the benefit of mankind, and brought with it more than his own benefaction; for people were assured that at least their bounty would be faithfully and carefully expended. He made his appearance at Court sometimes; but I have not heard, that either openly or privately he solicited a reward for his ser∣vices, although he was now acquainted with some of those who had the dispensation of court favours. He was not however suffered to waste his little fortune entirely in the service of others: Five citizens of Lon∣don, of whom the late Mr. <HI>Hoare</HI>, the banker, was one, waited on Lord Bute, the then minister, in a body; and in their own names, and the names of their fellow citizens, requested some notice might be taken of him; and, on the seventeenth of
<PB N="194" REF="205"/>
July, 1762, he was appointed, by patent, one of the commissioners for victualling the navy.</P>
<P>With the increase of income, which this appointment produced, he thought he might extend his acquaintance, and took a house in Red Lion Square, the principal rooms of which he furnished, and decorated with paintings and emblematical devices, in a style peculiar to himself. <Q>"I found," he was used to say, when speaking of these orna∣ments, “that my countrymen and women were not <HI>au fait</HI> in the art of conversa∣tion, and that instead of recurring to their cards, when the discourse began to flag, the minutes between the time of assembling, and the placing the card tables, are spent in an irksome suspense; for conversation has no charms when the mind is not en∣gaged in it. To relieve this vacuum in social intercourse, and prevent cards from engrossing the whole of my visitors minds,
<PB N="195" REF="206"/>
I have presented them with objects the most attractive that I could imagine, and such as cannot easily be examined without exciting amusing and instructive discourse ”—and when that fails, there are the cards."</Q></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>THOUGHTS ON MUSIC.</HEAD>
<P>IN 1765, Mr. Hanway published his <HI>"Thoughts on Music,"</HI> a work which he was induced to undertake, by his frequent at∣tendance at the performances of the Aca∣demy of Ancient Music. It must be con∣fessed that he was entirely unacquainted with his subject: He had not even a dis∣tant idea of harmony; and, as is the case, I believe, with all persons who have not the rudiments of the art, he felt no music until, by hearing it several times, it be∣came, in some measure, familiar to his ear. Speaking of this science some years after
<PB N="196" REF="207"/>
the publication of his work, I endeavoured by means of a harpsichord to describe the octave, the manner in which concords are produced by the vibration of strings of dif∣ferent lengths, the change which is made in the style and effect of the same air, when transposed into a different key, &amp;c. but I found myself unintelligible. It is true, that in his book he does not profess to speak much of the theory of the art; but confines himself in a great measure to pointing out how it might be best conducted to encou∣rage virtuous principles, and assist the fer∣vour of religious worship.</P>
<P>ON Saturday the eighteenth of May 1765, a fire happened at Montreal, in the province of Quebec, which, in three hours, consumed a fourth part of the city; one hundred and eight principal houses, in∣habited
<PB N="197" REF="208"/>
by two hundred and fifteen fami∣lies, with their merchandize, furniture, and apparel, to the amount of eighty-seven thou∣sand five hundred and eighty pounds. The sufferers were a loyal, obedient, and laborious people, and before this accident were re∣covering from the calamities of war. Mr. Thornton, Mr. Hanway, and Mr. Fowler Walker, as agents for the sufferers, peti∣tioned the king in council for a brief, which they obtained, and collected thereon eight thousand four hundred and fifteen pounds.</P>
<P><Q>In the “<HI>Case of the Canadians at Mon∣treal,"</HI> ”Mr. Hanway thus endeavours to excite the compassion of his fellow citizens.</Q> <Q>“Of all the calamities incident to human life, none are more dreadful than fire. Scarce was the sword well sheathed, and the widow's tears dried up, when this con∣flagration happened. Under their former governors grown desperate by repeated defeats, these people had experienced the
<PB N="198" REF="209"/>
calamities of war, not with us only, but also with the savage Indians. They had likewise felt the affliction of famine, and the interruption of their trade, and they dreaded the same hard fate from us; but they were agreeably surprised by a different rule of conduct. The remains of their substance was improving when this melancholy event fell upon them. Many escaped from the fire, who have no food to satisfy their hunger, no raiment to cover their nakedness, no house to guard them from the inclemency of the sky; and shall not these various distresses move our compassion? Let us not think they have no claim upon us; but stretch forth our arms to relieve them; in hopes, one day, to receive the mercy which the great Parent of mankind will extend to all his obedient children, when the whole ”earth shall be dissolved by fire."</Q></P>
<P>A subscription was immediately begun,
<PB N="199" REF="210"/>
exclusive of the brief, and the amount transmitted to Montreal, chiefly in silver, with two fire engines, and a marble bust of his present Majesty, to be set up in the town.</P>
<P>The very next year a dreadful fire broke out in Bridge Town in Barbadoes, which consumed buildings and property to the amount of near one hundred thousand pounds. A subscription was opened, in which Mr. Hanway was a principal actor, and fourteen thousand eight hundred and eighty-six pounds were collected, and trans∣mitted to a committee appointed at Barba∣does to distribute it to the unfortunate suf∣ferers.</P>
<P>FROM the year 1766 to 1772, he was engaged in his official business, and in sup∣porting the charitable institutions which he
<PB N="200" REF="211"/>
had founded or interested himself in, with∣out attempting any new plan of conse∣quence. In this year he first endea∣voured to do something towards alleviating the miseries of young <HI>chimney sweepers</HI>. Be∣sides the distresses of these helpless beings, which are open to general observation, such as a contortion of the limbs, and the pre∣vention of their growth, they are liable to a disease peculiar to their occupation, now known by the name of the <HI>chimney sweeper's cancer</HI>. Four children have been brought together into a workhouse, all afflicted with this dreadful and incurable disease.</P>
<P>The difficulty was, what kind of relief could be afforded them. He knew well that there must be some to perform the lowest offices of life, whose drudgery should contribute to the general conveniency; and that to give them even a tolerable education, instead of alleviating their misery, would add to its poignancy; but he considered
<PB N="201" REF="212"/>
that however abject, they were still human beings, and intitled as such to the privileges of humanity. His first attempt was, by binding them regularly as apprentices, to place them more effectually under the cog∣nizance of the magistrates; and a subscrip∣tion was promoted to defray the expence, and furnish them with clothes. A great many were bound, some masters were prosecuted for cruel behaviour to their boys; and no inconsiderable portion of misery was pre∣vented.</P>
<P>Several years after he renewed his re∣presentations in behalf of these miserable beings, and leave was given to bring in a bill for the future regulation of chimney sweepers young apprentices; but death put an end to his exertions in their behalf, and they must now look for relief from other hands.</P>
<P><PB N="2O2" REF="213"/>IN 1773, he engaged in the question re∣lative to <HI>the most proper bread to be assized for general use</HI>. He was the commissioner su∣perintending the baking for the fleet; and his chief end was to convince the public that the whitest bread was not the most nu∣tritive. He proved that the whole produce of the grain, except only the outside hull, made the best food; and that the London bread owed its colour not to nature, but to an artificial mixture. The late Dr. Fothergill gave his assistance, by a Treatise, tending to prove that the <HI>fashionable</HI> bread was an article of difficult digestion. But their labours have not succeeded: The fact has been univer∣sally allowed, and universally neglected, al∣though of such consequence.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="214"/>IN the year 1774, young Calas, son of the unfortunate merchant, who had been unjustly broke on the wheel at Toulouse, for the supposed murder of his son, came to England to solicit the contributions of men of property and compassion, for the support of the remains of his family. I had read Mr. Voltaire's Memoire of the transac∣tion; and when he waited on Mr. Hanway, with the curiosity and warmth of a young mind, I inquired of Monsieur Calas some particulars, which Mr. Voltaire had not mentioned. He was at that time a tall thin young man, with sharp features, and a settled melancholy on his countenance. He answered my questions with patience, but very shortly; spoke with reverence of Mr. Voltaire as the saviour of his mother, his brother, and himself; but seemed unwilling
<PB N="204" REF="215"/>
to enter into particulars of an event, which he could not reflect on without sorrow. He understood no English, and never spoke but to answer some question, leaving all to the representations contained in Mr. Vol∣taire's Memorial.</P>
<P>IN 1775, Mr. Hanway endeavoured to procure some alteration in the police of these cities. His favourite plan was <HI>Solitude in Im∣prisonment</HI>, on the principle, that the prisoner might become better by reflection, and could not grow worse by conversation with more experienced malefactors. This principle seems to meet the ideas of magistrates in general, and is adopted in many prisons with success; and it may be hoped that the time is not far off, when the extreme severity of our crimi∣nal laws shall no longer render it impossi∣ble to execute them; when rewards shall
<PB N="205" REF="216"/>
be offered to those who, by exerting them∣selves in punishing small offences, shall find it their interest to prevent, not encourage, the commission of capital crimes; and when it shall not be necessary for prosecutors or juries to render the laws uncertain, by a humane but capricious lenity.</P>
<P>FEBRUARY 1776, Mr. Matthias, the British resident at Hamburgh, acquainted the Earl of Suffolk, secretary of state, that there were several ships at that place, whose owners were willing to let them as trans∣ports, to be used in the war with America; and the lords of the Admiralty directed the Victualling Board to send one of their com∣missioners to contract for the supply of pro∣visions for the troops. Mr. Hanway was now in his sixty-fourth year; yet he en∣gaged himself to conduct this business, and went to Hamburgh, and completed his em∣bassy with the activity of a young man.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="217"/>About this time he formed a plan for an hospital for the relief of persons afflicted with the venereal disease, in the east end of the town. A subscription was opened, and the house, which had formerly been the Magdalene Hospital, in Goodman's Fields was taken. But the subscriptions decreasing in a few years, the design was laid aside. He computed that one third of the number of those who, in the bills of mortality, are said to die of consumptions, fall victims in reality to the ravages of this loathsome disease, and the more deadly effects of ig∣norant persons to cure it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MARITIME SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>THE encouragement of seamen was an object never from Mr. Hanway's heart. Having by his constant attention brought the Marine Society to a very respectable and permanent condition, he thought he should
<PB N="207" REF="218"/>
still add to the benefit of the service, by giving a naval education to the sons of those brave officers, who might fall in defence of their country. To this end he framed the plan of the <HI>Maritime School</HI>, which he sub∣mitted to Lord Spencer, the Duke of Bol∣ton, Lord Hawke, and Sir George Pococke, who approving the design, a subscription was opened, a house taken at Chelsea, and in March 1779, eleven scholars were ad∣mitted.</P>
<P>The annual subscription rose to eight hun∣dred pounds. In 1782, the government of Bombay sent over a subscription collected there, amounting to one thousand and se∣venty pounds. His Royal Highness the Duke of Cumberland accepted the office of President on the Death of Lord Hawke: the orphans of many deserving officers, par∣ticularly the gallant but unfortunate Cap∣tain Macartney, were received, and the in∣stitution, with an income equal to its ex∣pence,
<PB N="208" REF="219"/>
seemed likely to increase in splendour and acquire stability; when an unlucky event took place, which, by sowing the seeds of animosity among some of the Go∣vernors, in a few years greatly lessened the finances of the society. A certain personage, one of the governors, on the request of a com∣mittee of governors, appointed for the pur∣pose, of whom Mr. Hanway was one, had condescended to promise his assistance in pro∣curing the time the scholars might remain in the school, to be allowed as part of the six years necessary for a lieutenant's qualification. Mr. Hanway, impatient of the least delay, ap∣plied separately to the first lord of the Ad∣miralty, for the same purpose, which interfer∣ence not only gave offence to the nobleman, but being defended by some of the gover∣nors, and complained of by the rest, dis∣turbed that harmony which had before reigned, and is so necessary to the success of every undertaking of this kind. A va∣riety
<PB N="209" REF="220"/>
of circumstances concurring with this, the subscriptions decreased; and the institu∣tion is now barely kept alive by the exer∣tions of the two principal masters.</P>
<P>On the failure of this attempt, Mr. Han∣way endeavoured to incorporate a seminary for naval instruction, with the plan of the Marine Society, which he hoped would in time be adopted by every county in the kingdom. He was so fully persuaded of the expediency of this design, that he tried every means to establish it; but the gene∣rality of the governors, although convinced that something might be done by the society in time of peace, towards preparing for war when it should happen, thought Mr. Han∣way's plan too extensive to be adopted, and the business ended in sitting up a ship to lie on the Thames, where boys might be harboured and taught the rudiments of Na∣vigation, and be ready for any commande<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who might demand them.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="221"/>In 1783, finding his health decline, he determined to resign his office at the victual∣ling board, which he did on the second of October that year, and immediately re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eived a grant of his whole salary by way of a pen∣sion, to continue for life. This favour he owed to the esteem which his Majesty, to whom he was personally known, entertained of him; excited by his various exertions in behalf of his country and mankind.</P>
<P>He was now released from his most ma∣terial business; but did not think it would conduce to his happiness to lead an idle life: He engaged again in behalf of the chimney sweepers boys, and promoted, by every means in his power, the establishment of Sunday schools, which are now in a fair way to be adopted in every county in England.</P>
<P>He likewise promoted a subscription for the relief of the many black poor people, who wandered about the metropolis in ex∣treme distress, and the lords of the Trea∣sury
<PB N="211" REF="222"/>
seconded the design, by directing mo∣ney, as far as fourteen pounds a head, to be issued to the committee, to enable them to send the blacks to such places abroad as might be fixed on; a plan, which, if it can be executed faithfully, must tend to relieve the misery of these poor people, and pre∣vent the unnatural connections between black persons and white; the disagree∣able consequences of which make their ap∣pearance but too frequently in our streets.</P>
<P>In the Summer of 1786, his health de∣clined so visibly, that he thought it necessary to attend only to that. He had long felt the approach of a disorder in the bladder, which, increasing by degrees, caused a strangury, and at length, on the fifth of September 1786, put a period to a life spent almost entirely in the service of his fellow creatures.</P>
<P>It may truly be said of this good man, that nothing in his life became him better
<PB N="212" REF="223"/>
than his dying: During the progress of a tedious, and sometimes painful illness, he never once expressed the least impatience; but saw the approach of his dissolution with∣out regret. When he grew so weak as to be confined to his bed, he requested his physicians to speak frankly, and without reserve of his disorder; and when con∣vinced that he could not recover, he sent and paid all his tradesmen; took leave of his most intimate friends; dictated some letters to absent acquaintances; had the sacrament administered to him, and discoursed, with the most cheerful composure, of his affairs. His lungs, of which he had always been particularly careful, perhaps because they were originally weak, remained perfect to the last moment; and he expressed his sa∣tisfaction that his mind had never <HI>wandered</HI> or been <HI>perplexed</HI> throughout the whole of his illness. In the morning previous to his death, he said to an intimate friend, <Q>“I
<PB N="213" REF="224"/>
have no uncomfortable reflections con∣cerning my approaching end; but I find the <HI>vis vitae</HI> so strong, that I think I shall not take my leave of the world without a ”sharp struggle."</Q> To his surgeon he said, <Q>“If you think it will be of service in your practice, or to any one who may come after me, I beg you will have my body opened: I am willing to do as much ”good as is possible."</Q></P>
<P>The evening of the night on which he died, he desired to put on a fine ruffled shirt; gave up his keys; disposed of some trinkets, and had his will read to him. About midnight a coldness seized the extre∣mities, which, however, was removed se∣veral times, and the circulation restored, by frictions, which he himself directed. The last time he bade his attendant rub his leg, on which the fatal chilness had seized; he uttered a sigh, which alarming the person, he ceased the friction a few moments: the
<PB N="214" REF="225"/>
cold increased; he was sensible of the im∣mediate approach of his death: His lungs yet played with freedom: The last breath escaped him in the midst of a sentence, which began with the word "Christ!" The cause of his death appeared to be an indu∣ration of the prostrate gland.</P>
<P>Such were the last moments of Jonas Hanway, Esq. and such, if the intellectual faculties are preserved, may be those of all who live like him. He prepared for death with as much cheerfulness as he would have prepared for a journey. It was his study to be always ready for the event, whenever it should happen, and he was careless about the time. About twelve months before his death, whilst he was standing in his study reading a paper, he fell down as suddenly as if he had been struck by light∣ning. His clerk was near and raised him up, and placed him in a chair. <Q>After a few mi∣nutes he recovered, and said, “this is by no
<PB N="215" REF="226"/>
means an unpleasant way of taking ones departure; but I may as well keep the lamp of life burning as long as I can; at least I will inquire of my medical friends ”the nature and cause of this attack."</Q></P>
<P>The attention which the gentlemen of the faculty paid to him in his last illness, de∣serves the most honourable mention, and shewed that they knew the value of the life they endeavoured to preserve: To the duty of a careful physician, they added the anxi∣ous wish of private friendship, and testified the sense they entertained of their loss, by the most unfeigned sorrow.</P>

<HEAD><HI>PART III.</HI> REMARKABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE LIFE OF JONAS HANWAY, ESQ.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the preceding narrative, the in∣telligent reader will, I conceive, be able to form a tolerably correct idea of the charac∣ter of Mr. Hanway. He will see that the love of human kind was the prevailing passion in his breast, and that when once he had
<PB N="218" REF="228"/>
engaged in any office of general benevo∣lence, no obstacles could stand before his active perseverance; but such was the es∣teem which the public entertained of him, that I trust I shall be excused in attempting to describe him in the line of domestick life, and at those hours (they were very few) when public concerns did not engage his attention. The curiosity of future times may desire to know every circumstance re∣lating to a man, to whom posterity will ac∣knowledge itself so much indebted.</P>
<P>Mr. Hanway in his person was of the middle size, of a thin spare habit, but well shaped; his limbs were fashioned with the nicest symmetry. In the latter years of his life he stooped very much, and when he walked, found it conduce to ease to let his head incline towards one side. When he went first to Russia at the age of thirty, his face was full and comely, and his person altogether such as obtained for him the ap∣pellation
<PB N="219" REF="229"/>
of the <HI>"Handsome Englishman."</HI> But the shock which his health received in Per∣sia, made him much thinner; and though he recovered his health, so as to live in England twenty successive years without any material illness, he never recovered his plumpness.</P>
<P>His features were small, but without the insignificance which commonly attends small features. His countenance was inte∣resting, sensible, and calculated to inspire reverence. His blue eyes had never been brilliant; but they expressed the utmost hu∣manity and benevolence; and when he spoke, the animation of his countenance and the tone of his voice were such as seemed to carry conviction with them even to the mind of a stranger. When he endeavoured to soothe distress, or point out to any wretch who had strayed, the comforts of a virtuous life, he was peculiarly impressive; and
<PB N="220" REF="230"/>
every thing that he said had an air of con∣sideration and sincerity.</P>
<P>In his dress, as far as was consistent with his ideas of health and ease, he accommo∣dated himself to the prevailing fashion. As it was frequently necessary for him to ap∣pear in polite circles, on unexpected occa∣sions, he usually wore dress clothes, with a large French bag: His hat, ornamented with a gold button, was of a size and fashion to be worn as well under the arm as on the head. When it rained, a small <HI>parapluie</HI> de∣fended his face and wig. Thus he was al∣ways prepared to enter into any company, without impropriety, or the appearance of negligence. His dress for set public occa∣sions was a suit of rich dark brown; the coat and waistcoat lined throughout with ermine, which just appeared at the edges; and a small gold hilted sword. As he was extremely susceptible of cold, he wore flannel under the linings of all his
<PB N="221" REF="231"/>
clothes, and usually three pair of stockings. He was the first man who ventured to walk the streets of London with an umbrella over his head: After carrying one near thirty years, he saw them come into general use.</P>
<P>The precarious state of his health when he arrived in England from Russia, made it necessary for him to use the utmost caution; and his perseverance in following the ad∣vice of the medical practitioners was re∣markable. After Dr. Lieberkyn, physician to the king of Prussia, had recommended milk as a proper diet to restore his strength, he made it the chief part of his food for thirty years; and though it at first dis∣agreed with him, he persisted in trying it un∣der every preparation that it was capable of, till it agreed with his stomach. He knew that exercise was necessary to him, and he loved it. He was not one of those who had rather take a close than a walk; and though he had commonly his carriage with him
<PB N="222" REF="232"/>
when he went abroad, he yet walked nearly as much as he rode, and with such a pace, that he used to say he was always more in∣commoded in the streets by those he passed, than by them who overtook him. By this rigid attention and care his health was established, his lungs acquired strength and elasticity; and it is probable he would have lived several years longer, if the disorder, which was the immediate cause of his death, had left him to the gradual decay of nature.</P>
<P>His mind was the most active that it is possible to conceive; always on the wing, and never appearing to be weary. To sit still, and endeavour to give rest to the thought, was a luxury to which he was a perfect stranger: he dreaded nothing so much as inactivity, and that modern disor∣der which the French, who feel it not so much as ourselves, distinguish by the name of <HI>ennui</HI>.</P>
<P>He rose in the summer at four or five,
<PB N="223" REF="233"/>
and in the winter at seven; and having al∣ways business before him, he was every day employed till the time of retiring to rest; and when in health, I am told, was com∣monly asleep within two minutes after his lying down in bed.</P>
<P>Writing was his favourite employment, or rather amusement; and when the num∣ber of his literary works is considered, and that they were the produce only of those hours, which he was able to snatch from public business, an idea may be formed of his application. He wrote a fine flowing hand to the last, when he pleased, without spectacles. And he had always one or two of the clerks belonging to his office, or to some of the charitable institutions in which he was engaged, to live in his house and assist him. When Doctor Goldsmith, to relieve himself from the labour of writing, engaged an amanuensis, he found himself incapable of dictation; and after eying each
<PB N="224" REF="234"/>
other some time, unable to proceed, the Doctor put a guinea in his hand, and sent him away: but it was not so with Mr. Hanway; he could compose faster than any person could write. His mode was to dictate for as many hours together as he could spare, and afterwards correct the copy, which was again wrote out and cor∣rected, perhaps several times.</P>
<P>To write a fine hand very fast is a qua∣lification which many persons, not defective in abilities, do not attain; but to write very well, and with strict orthography from the verbal dictation of another person, with∣out hesitation, will be found difficult by every person who tries it. Yet all this Mr. Hanway required, and with it the utmost dispatch. This made it necessary for him to choose his assistants, at an early age, whilst the mind is flexible, and to have them live in his house, and take pains to in∣struct them. He had a very happy method
<PB N="225" REF="235"/>
of conveying instruction; but the close ap∣plication which he required at all hours, his impatience, and the natural turn of his temper, seldom satisfied, not infrequently petulant, and always expressing his disappro∣bation in terms which had the appearance of ill nature, were the cause that but few of the youths he took under his care remained with him any length of time. If by attention, activity, and perseverance, and a judicious self-commendation, not too frequently as∣sumed, they could go on till they gained his confidence, he seldom failed to make them alert, ready at figures and writing, and honest men. One of the two pamphlets on bread, which contains ninety octavo pages, 200 law sheets, I wrote from his dictation, in one forenoon, although there are several calculations in it of the proportionate pro∣duce of grain, when ground, dressed, and baked.</P>
<P>By leaving his work to transact his or∣dinary
<PB N="226" REF="236"/>
business, and afterwards recurring to it with new ideas, all his literary labours are defective in the arrangement of the mat∣ter, and appear to have too much of the miscellaneous in their composition. The ori∣ginal idea is sometimes left for the pursuit of one newly started, and either taken up again, when the mind of the reader has almost lost it, or it is totally deserted. Yet those who are judges of literary composition, say that his language is well calculated to have the effect he desired on the reader, and impress him with the idea that the author was a man of inflexible integrity, and wrote from the pure dictates of the heart. It is plain and unornamented, without the appearance of art, or the affectation of singularity. Its greatest defect (say they) is a want of con∣ciseness; its greatest beauty an unaffected and genuine simplicity. He spoke French and Portuguese, and understood the Rus
<PB N="227" REF="237"/>
and modern Persic imperfectly: Latin he had been taught at school; but had not much occasion to cultivate it after he entered into life.</P>
<P>In his natural disposition he was cheerful but serene. He enjoyed his own joke, and applauded the wit of another; but never descended from a certain dignity which he thought indispensably necessary. His ex∣perience furnished him with some anecdote or adventure, suitable to every turn the dis∣course could take; and he was always wil∣ling to communicate it. If in the hour of conviviality the discourse took a turn, not consistent with the most rigid chastity, he was not forward to reprove or take offence; but any attack on religion, especially in the company of young people, was sure to meet his most pointed disapprobation. In conversation he was easy of access, and gave readily to every one the best answer which occurred: But not fond of much
<PB N="228" REF="238"/>
speaking himself, he did not always bear with patience, though commonly with si∣lence, the forward and importunate; them with whom every man, and every thing is either the very best or the very worst pos∣sible; who exemplify, for the instruction of their auditors, those common ideas which it is not possible could escape them; and think loudness, and the gesticulation of un∣necessary warmth, can supply the place of argument and politeness. If the mirth de∣generated into boisterous laughter, he took his leave: <Q>"My companions," he would say, “were too merry to be happy, or to ”let me be happy, so I left them."</Q> He spoke better in public than was to be ex∣pected of one who wrote so much, and pointed to his subject; though he was some∣times seduced into an eulogium on the use∣fulness of the <HI>merchant</HI>, a character for which he entertained great reverence.</P>
<P>Although he himself never drank wine
<PB N="229" REF="239"/>
undiluted with water, he partook willingly of the joys of the table, and that felicity of conversation, which a moderate application to the bottle excites among men of parts; but he knew how the love of company in∣fatuates young people, and the danger to which it exposes them. The writer of these sheets is indebted to him beyond the power of expression, particularly for his advice, which he had the method of administering with∣out giving disgust; and he never received so serious a caution as when at a public meeting, at the desire of Sir Joseph An∣drews, he sung a song better than Mr. Han∣way expected.</P>
<P>In his transactions with the world, he was always open, candid, and sincere: What∣ever he said might be depended on with im∣plicit confidence. He adhered to the strict truth, even in the <HI>manner</HI> of his relation, and no brilliancy of thought could induce him to vary from the fact; but although so
<PB N="230" REF="240"/>
frank in his own proceedings, he had seen too much of life to be easily deceived by others; and he did not often place a confidence that was betrayed. He did not, however, think the world so degenerate as is commonly imagined: "And if I did," he used to say, <Q>“I would not let it appear; for nothing can tend so effectually to make a man wicked, or to keep him so, as a marked suspicion. Confidence is the reward of truth and fidelity, and these should never ”be exerted in vain."</Q></P>
<P>In his department of commissioner for victualling the navy, he was uncommonly assiduous and attentive, and kept the con∣tractors, and persons who had dealings with the office, at a great distance. He would not even accept a hare or pheasant, or the smal∣lest present from any of them; and when any were sent him he always returned them, not in a morose manner, as if he affected the excess of disinterestedness, but with some
<PB N="231" REF="241"/>
mild answer, such as, <Q>“Mr. Hanway re∣turns many thanks to Mr. — for the present he intended him; but he has made it a rule not to accept any thing from any person engaged with the office. A rule, which, whilst he acknowledges Mr. —'s good intentions, he hopes ”he will not expect him to break through."</Q></P>
<P>With all this goodness Mr. Hanway had a certain singularity of thought and manners, which was, perhaps, the consequence of his living the greater part of his life in foreign countries, and never having been married. He was not by any means an inattentive ob∣server of the little forms of politeness; but as he had studied them in various realms, selecting those which he approved, his po∣liteness differed from that of other people. His conversation had an air of originality in it, which was pleasing, far different from that of some very polite circles, in which a whole evening may be passed in perpetual
<PB N="232" REF="242"/>
chat, without a single idea being started that has not had its round before.</P>
<P>There is, perhaps, more originality of expression among the lower orders of men than in polite circles, where every sentence is weighed in the mind before utterance is given to it. In one of Mr. Hanway's walks, in the neighbourhood of Park-lane, he was met by a man much inebriated, who ap∣proached him in so irregular a direction, that it might have been concluded he had busi∣ness on both sides the way. Mr. Hanway stopped when he came up to him to give him his choice which he would take; but the man stood as still as his intoxication would permit him, without attempting to pass on either side. After viewing each other a moment, says Mr. H. <Q>“My friend, you ”seem as if you had drank rather too much:" to which the man replied, “<HI>You seem as if ”you had eat rather too little."</HI></Q></P>
<P>He never took any of his servants from
<PB N="233" REF="243"/>
the recommendation of his friends; but commonly advertised for them, appointing their applications to be left at some tavern. One advertisement for a cook was answered by more than a hundred letters, and he di∣rected his clerk to request the attendance of about a fourth part of this number at dif∣ferent hours of the next day, which he de∣dicated to this business; but by an unlucky mistake they were all appointed to come at the same hour; and at noon, on a hot day, in the midst of Summer, were seen upwards of twenty cooks parading the square, broil∣ing in the sun, inquiring for Mr. A. B. and attended by several hundred spectators.</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Hanway, at another time, had hired a coachman, and was telling him the duty he required, concluding, “you will attend with the rest of my family every evening ”at prayers."</Q>—<HI>"Prayers, Sir!"</HI> says the descendant of Jehu, <Q>“Why, did you never ”say your prayers?"</Q> asked Mr. Hanway.
<PB N="234" REF="244"/>
<HI>"I have never lived in a praying family."</HI> <Q>“But have you any objection to say your ”pray∣ers?"</Q> <Q>“No, Sir, I've no objection—I hope ”you'll consider it in my wages."</Q></P>
<P>During the progress of Mr. Hanway's ex∣ertions in favour of chimney sweepers, he addressed a little urchin, after he had swept a chimney in his own house; <Q>“Suppose ”now I give you a shilling."</Q> <Q>“God Al∣mighty ”bless your honour, and thank you!"</Q> <Q>“And what if I give you a fine tie-wig to ”wear on May-day, which is just at hand?"</Q> <Q>“Ah, bless your honour! my master won't let me ”go out on May-day."</Q>—"No: why not?" <HI>"He says its low life."</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Hanway was mentioning this answer, I think, to Mr. George Keate, when that gentleman gave him a similar anecdote. He was riding in the country on horse-back, and came to a place where some gypsies were regaling themselves under a hedge with tea, and just as he passed, a strapping girl, one of
<PB N="235" REF="245"/>
the fraternity, was emptying the tea leaves out of the pot on the ground, when her com∣panion thus rebuked her; <Q>“Lord, Sal! why don't you lay them on a leaf? some poor ”body might be glad of them."</Q></P>
<P>Among the ornaments of his with-draw∣ing room, were some, which deserve to be mentioned, because they help to illustrate his character. He had procured portraits of six of the most celebrated beauties, one of which was of the actress <HI>Adrienne le Couvreur</HI>, who died in the arms of Voltaire. These portraits, being all of the same size, he employed an ingenious workman to at∣tach together, by a ribbon curiously carved and gilded, which extended several feet, so as to admit of their hanging in an uniform manner. On the smooth parts of this rib∣bon, which were glazed, were written some lines in praise of beauty; and over all was a statue representing humility. At the bot∣tom hung a mirror, just sufficiently convex
<PB N="236" REF="246"/>
to reflect a lady who looked in it of the size of the portraits. Round the frame of the mirror was painted,
<Q><L>"Wert thou, my daughter, fairest of the <HI>seven</HI>;</L>
<L>"Think on the progress of devouring Time,</L>
<L>"And pay thy tribute to Humility."</L></Q></P>
<P>On the opposite side of the room was a picture, representing the tomb of Pierre Mignard, painter to the king of France; and underneath a drawing of a country church-yard, with a venerable old man seemingly in discourse with a young one. At a distance a young woman was seen pray∣ing near a grave; and on the side of a tomb, on which the old man's hand was laid, the following lines were inscribed:
<Q><L>BEHOLD, my son, this nameless monument,</L>
<L>Instructive satire on our fond conceits.</L>
<L>'Tis not a name, but wisdom's character,</L>
<L>Can raise and fire the immortal part of man.</L>
<L>Within you stately temple thou may'st see</L>
<L>The sculptur'd marble in its highest pomp;</L>
<L>The curious workman's elevated art.</L>
<L><PB N="237" REF="247"/>Pride still deludes us, with her foolish hopes</L>
<L>Of fame, from tott'ring busts and empty urns.</L>
<L>When thou hast run thy course dost thou expect</L>
<L>Esteem and love will croud about thy hearse?</L>
<L>So great is man's forgetfulness of man,</L>
<L>And gratitude, like thought, so quickly dies;</L>
<L>'Tis equal all, the peasant and the prince.</L>
<L>No record can avail but that of heaven.</L>
<L>Thy faithful homage at religion's shrine</L>
<L>Will heal all wounds thy virtue can receive:</L>
<L>What greater bliss can we require, or God</L>
<L>Bestow on beings so impure and frail!</L>
<L>The daughter's tears shed o'er her father's grave,</L>
<L>Claim the sweet homage of humanity.</L>
<L>Thy sorrows shewn for such unfeign'd distress,</L>
<L>Are tributes which thou pay'st at mercy's seat.</L>
<L>But mark me well, my son—</L>
<L>True wisdom's children learn her pleasant ways,</L>
<L>And still rejoice amid their sufferings:</L>
<L>Their calling is to practise what they preach;</L>
<L>Secure in pious conquest o'er the world,</L>
<L>They seek and find the golden key of life,</L>
<L>Which opes the portal to eternal bliss.</L>
<L>O, may'st thou learn to think, and reason right,</L>
<L>And justly count upon eternity!</L>
<L>That, whether thy short life shall end to day,</L>
<L>Or last a number of progressive years:</L>
<L>Whether rich trophies shall adorn thy tomb,</L>
<L>Or like this monument, thy name shall cease;</L>
<L>Let this day pass in happy, glad presage,</L>
<L>Of those rewards that wait on virtue's deeds.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="248"/>Mr. Hanway appeared to have in every action of his life, the idea of his end. He examined his own conduct with the same degree of severity, which men too often adopt in their scrutiny into the conduct of others, and always considered that the time would come, and might not be far off, when he should reflect with sorrow on every bad action of his life. There are many very good men, who, knowing that death is in∣evitable, endeavour to banish from their mind the awful thought; but Mr. Hanway seemed to derive a melancholy pleasure in indulging the idea. Of the effects of this I proceed to a remarkable instance: He caused the following words to be inscribed on a large plate of brass enamelled, so contrived as to slide on rollers, and form the back of a wardrobe, and lock in a se∣cret manner. At the top of the plate was painted, on the left side, himself in an in∣fant state, and on the right on a death bed, and underneath the lines;</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="249"/>I BELIEVE THAT MY REDEEMER LIVETH, AND THAT I ALSO SHALL RISE FROM THE GRAVE. JONAS HANWAY, ESQ. WHO, TRUSTING IN THAT GOOD PROVIDENCE, WHICH SO VISIBLY GOVERNS THE WORLD, I ASSED THROUGH A VARIETY OF FORTUNES WITH PATIENCE. LIVING THE GREATEST PART OF HIS DAYS IN FOREIGN LANDS, RULED BY ARBITRARY POWER, HE RECEIVED THE DEEPER IMPRESSION OF THE HAPPY CONSTITUTION OF HIS OWN COUNTRY; WHILST THE PERSUASIVE LAWS CONTAINED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT, AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN DEPRAVITY, SOFTENED HIS HEART TO A SENSE OF THE VARIOUS WANTS OF HIS FELLOW CREATURES. <HI>READER</HI>, INQUIRE NO FURTHER; THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON HIS SOUL AND THINE! APPREHENSIVE OF THE TOO PARTIAL REGARD OF HIS FRIENDS; AND ESTEEMING PLAIN TRUTH ABOVE THE PROUDEST TROPHIES OF MONUMENTAL FLATTERY; AT THE AGE OF FIFTY-ONE HE CAUSED THIS PLATE AND INSCRIPTION TO BE MADE.</P>
<P><PB N="240" REF="250"/>His religion was pure, rational, fervent, and sincere; equally distant from a cold in∣animate languor, and the phantasies of su∣pernatural intelligence: It was his resource constantly in trouble, as was writing at the moment of imagination. He believed the truths revealed in the gospel, with the most unvaried confidence; but shewed no auste∣rity to persons who set the dictates of na∣ture and experience in opposition to them, if they appeared to doubt with a willingness to be convinced. He considered religion as the most effectual restraint on bad actions; and although he rejoiced at the light which has been thrown by Mr. Voltaire, and other modern writers, on the superstition of former ages; he preferred even that, with its attendant cruelty and selfishness, to a comfortless scepticism, and sometimes pro∣ceeded so far as to express his fears that the generality might one day become too en∣lightened to be happy. In his writings on
<PB N="241" REF="251"/>
the subject, he endeavours to inculcate the necessity of attending at the public offices, particularly that of the Lord's Supper; but carefully avoids entering into controversies on matters not necessary to salvation. The only religious argument that he engaged in, was to convince the common people that they ought not to be deterred from partak∣ing of the sacrament, by St. Paul's caution to the Corinthians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, KPIMA <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>.</P><P>Nam edens et bibens indigne, <HI>judicium</HI> sibi ipsi man∣ducat et bibit, non dijudicans corpus Domini.</P></NOTE> and that the word used by the apostle relative to the punishment of those who partook wantonly, could not be applied to <HI>them</HI> in the vulgar translation, of "eating and drinking <HI>damnation</HI>;" but meant a temporary and expiable punish∣ment; and the learned, I believe, agree that this construction of the text is the true one.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="252"/>He knew well how much the happiness of mankind is dependant on honest industry, and received a pleasure, but faintly described in words, when any of the objects of his charity cleanly apparelled, and with cheer∣ful and contented countenances, came to pay their respects to him. He treated them as his acquaintances, entered into their con∣cerns with a paternal affection, and let them know that on any real emergency they might apply with confidence to him. It was this, rather than the largeness of his gifts, that endeared him so much to the common people: He never walked out but was fol∣lowed by the good wishes, silent or expres∣sed, of some to whom he had offered relief. To meet the eye of him whom he had obliged, was to him the highest luxury; and no man enjoyed it oftener.</P>
<P>Of his charity, it is not easy to convey an adequate idea: It was of that prudent and considerate kind, which is of the most sub∣stantial
<PB N="243" REF="253"/>
benefit. It did not consist merely in <HI>giving</HI>; and though his heart was ever open to the complaint of the unfortunate, it required something more than mere sup∣plication to obtain his assistance. He was particularly careful to discountenance the fashionable genteel way of begging by let∣ter, in which talents capable of procuring sup∣port are held out as excuses for distress. To him that had once deceived him by fictitious distress he was inexorable; but when real misery, the effect of accident or inevitable misfortune, came in his way, he never failed to afford substantial relief, which he was al∣ways enabled to do; for he had the distribu∣tion every year of more than his own whole income amounted to. It is not the love of money, so much as the love of ease, which keeps close the coffers of the wealthy.</P>
<P>Several years ago Mr. Hanway commis∣sioned the writer of these sheets to distri∣bute a sum of money, as far as fifty pounds,
<PB N="244" REF="254"/>
among the really deserving prisoners at that time confined in the prisons of the metropo∣lis. How did I figure to myself the plea∣sure I should experience in relieving the dis∣tresses of the wretched, in setting the hand of the industrious to work, and giving food and vigour, and even liberty to him who drooped under the gloom of despair! but I soon found that there was not the distress in our prisons which I had conceived; and that where it really was, there was not the greatest appearance of it. Great part of the money was brought back; and al∣though the precaution of buying and distri∣buting the necessaries of life, was taken, yet those necessaries were bartered for the means of intoxication, and I was invited to drink brandy, the produce of the money I had bestowed in coals and candles, in a pri∣son, whence all spirits are supposed to be ba∣nished by the strictest of our laws.</P>
<P>But a few unworthy objects never alien∣ated
<PB N="245" REF="255"/>
Mr. Hanway's affection for the really deserving. These he endeavoured to find out in their solitary habitations, with a most laborious perseverance; studied their wants, and contrived the method of giving the most effectual relief. In one of his searches among the mansions of the poor, he found a man of the name of <HI>Bermingham</HI> in extreme distress; and which he soon perceived to be the effect of his ingenuity and simplicity. He was an engraver, a painter on glass, a modeller, a carver, the inventor of pierc∣ing fan sticks, a turner in metals; and worked with such an enthusiasm of zeal, that he would have starved amidst wealth, rather than leave his inventions to provide food. His goods, even his bed, were seized for rent; but he cared not if they left him the materials of his last discovery. His talents, and native simplicity, had recommended him to Frederick Prince of Wales, who ap∣pointed him his engraver with an annual pen∣sion;
<PB N="246" REF="256"/>
but when this failed, with the death of his patron, he was reduced to the ex∣treme of misery. Mr. Hanway at first en∣deavoured to confine his ingenuity to one line, and make it tend to his pecuniary ad∣vantage; but finding this impossible, he ap∣plied for, and procured a pension of forty pounds a year, from his Majesty. On this the poor artist was persuaded to retire from his labours into the country; but before he had enjoyed, or rather suffered the leisure of retirement one year, he was found drowned in a water near his residence.</P>
<P>When once Mr. Hanway had engaged in a public charitable undertaking, he omitted nothing that could possibly tend to its pro∣motion; no department was beneath him; his eye pervaded the who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> system, and, like that of Providence, never stopt whilst any thing remained to be done to further his benevolent designs. He thought every thing great which concerned the cause of
<PB N="247" REF="257"/>
humanity. The love of his fellow creatures shewed itself in every action of his life. Blessed with an elegant sufficiency, he se∣parated what was within his idea of enough, and looked upon the rest as appropriated, as a reserve to satisfy demands whenever they should be properly made. Distress, not incurred by profligacy, was to his heart a claim of relationship; and he seemed to esteem himself, what he most emphatically was, one of the chief instruments of Pro∣vidence, to assist the indigent, instruct the ignorant, to reclaim the guilty, and keep the good from being discontented with their station in life.</P>
<P>Indeed nothing can more clearly evince the esteem which men entertained for his character, than the sorrow they expressed at his death. A long train of friends followed his hearse, and assisted in paying the last mournful duties to the remains of a man they so tenderly loved whilst living. Dr.
<PB N="248" REF="258"/>
Glasse, one of his executors, read a part of the burial service over the corpse, as great a part as his grief would permit him; and Dr. Markham, with whom he had lived in friendship for a long series of years, in a very pathetic discourse recalled to the minds of their mutual friends assembled on this so∣lemn occasion in the church of Hendon, the virtues of the benevolent man they had lost. Alas! so uncertain is every thing human: In a few days the reverend gentleman's death inspired his surviving friends with senti∣ments similar to those he felt at being de∣prived of Mr. Hanway!</P>
<P>Such is the feeble attempt which I have made, to delineate the character of him whom I revered as a patron, and esteemed as the friend and adviser of my early youth. The property he left at his death, which did not amount to two thousand pounds, as he had no relation who wanted it, he bequeathed, except a few legacies as tokens of remem∣brance,
<PB N="249" REF="259"/>
to sundry orphans and poor persons, whom he had befriended in his life time; among these is <HI>Mercy Draper</HI>, whose musi∣cal powers had oft excited his tenderest thoughts whilst she was at the Foundling, and whose present unfortunate state of mind awakened his warmest friendship.</P>
<P>The following verses were sent me by a lady, who had frequent opportunities of see∣ing instances of Mr. Hanway's benevolence, and whose own heart taught her how to value his.</P>
