THE <HI>COZENERS;</HI> A COMEDY, IN THREE ACTS.</P>
<P>AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE-ROYAL in the HAYMARKET.</P>
<P>WRITTEN BY THE LATE <HI>SAMUEL FOOTE, Esq.</HI></P>
<P>AND NOW PUBLISHED BY <HI>Mr. COLMAN.</HI></P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>SOME copies of spurious impressions of this Comedy, and of the Maid of Bath, having been printed and circulated before the application to the Court of Chancery for an Injunction, it has been thought advisable, in vindication of the property of the Editor, as well as in justice to the deceased Author, imme∣diately to commit to the press genuine editions of the two dramatick pieces above-mentioned, together with the Comedy of the Devil Upon Two Sticks, which had been also without authority advertised for publication.</P>
<P>On inspection of the spurious impressions, it appears, that all the errors of careless and igno∣rant transcribers are there religiously preserved; and all the additions and improvements, made by the sacetious Writer, are omitted. Many instances of this will occur on perusal of this Comedy; in which, besides the restoration of several passages always spoken on the stage, the Reader will find a whole seene, at the end of the First Act, and another, still more entertaining
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
and popular, at the beginning of the Third; both which were wholly wanting in the spurious Impressions.</P>
<P>Unauthorized publications are not only always detrimental to private property, but commonly prove injurious to the publick: For the copies, being obtained by clandestine and indirect means, are, for the most part, as has happened in the present instance, incorrect and imperfect.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mr. FOOTE.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>IN trifling works of Fancy, wits agree,</L>
<L>That nothing tickles like a simile:</L>
<L>And so, by way of tuning you to laughter,</L>
<L>With which, I hope, you'll tickle us hereafter,</L>
<L>From our poetick storehouse, we produce</L>
<L>A couple, spick and span for present use.</L>
<L>Dramatick writers were, like watchmen, meant</L>
<L>To knock down Vice—few answer the intent;</L>
<L>Both should be quick to see and seize their game;</L>
<L>But both are sometimes blind, and sometimes lame:</L>
<L>Can those cry <HI>stand,</HI> while they themselves are reeling?</L>
<L>Can those catch thieves, while they themselves are stealing?</L>
<L>When wanted most, the watch a nap will take—</L>
<L>Are all our comick authors quite awake?</L>
<L>Or, what is worse, by which they still come near 'em,</L>
<L>Are not you more than half asleep who hear 'em?</L>
<L>I, your old watchman, here have six'd my stand,</L>
<L>On many a vice and folly laid my hand:</L>
<L>'Twas you cried <HI>watch!</HI> I limp'd at your command.</L>
<L>Let me, like other watchmen, bless the times,</L>
<L>And take the privilege to nod betimes;</L>
<L>Nor let your frowns now force me on a fright</L>
<L>To cry<HI>—"Past seven o'clock, and a cloudy night."</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, with your patience not to be too free,</L>
<L>We'll change the subject and the simile.</L>
<L>To chase a smuggling crew, who law deride,</L>
<L>We launch a cutter of three guns this tide:</L>
<L>With your assistance, we will make the foe</L>
<L>Sink, or submit to CAPTAIN TIMBERTOE,</L>
<L>Ye pirate criticks, fall not foul on me!</L>
<L>If once I sink, I founder in the sea.</L>
<L>In this condition, can I swim to shore?</L>
<L>I'm cork'd, 'tis true; but then I want an oar.</L>
<L>You oft have sav'd my little bark from sinking:</L>
<L>I am no si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, save me from water-drinking!</L>

<HEAD>SCENE I.</HEAD>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. Fleece'em and Flaw.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fleece'em.</SPEAKER>
<P>NOT a word more! you put me out of all patience.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but, madam Fleece|'em, listen, I beg, to a little reason.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Reason? had you the least atom about you, you would rest contented with our present agreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But surely, madam, a change of cir∣cumstances—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Change? And pray, master Flaw, how are mine changed for the better? Answer me a few short questions, and deny what I say, if you can. When I was compelled, by the cruel laws of this country, to go into exile for
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
taking by mistake a small parcel of lace out of a shop in the Strand, did not I choose Boston for my place of retirement?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Granted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I pass there, by means of letters from mynheer Van Smuggle of Rotter∣dam, for a person most honourably and nobly allied?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>For aught I know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I receive a handsome pre∣sent from that merchant, for promoting the running Dutch teas, and rejecting those imported from England?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Like enough.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not my burning the first pound of Souchong, and my speeches at Faneuil-Hall, and the Liberty-Tree, against the colonies con∣tributing to discharge a debt to which they owe their existence, procure me the love and esteem of the people?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>May be so.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what, but your letters, could induce me to return to a country where I had been treated so ill? But sure, you must have forgot your proposals; here they are, and signed by yourself. <Q>Let me see!—<STAGE>[Reads.]</STAGE> “Articles of Agreement between Philip Flaw, of Thavies-Inn, in the city of London, on one
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
part, and Felicia Fleece'em, late of Boston, but now of Pall-Mall.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what occasion—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q><HI>“Imprimis,</HI> That the said Felicia do take a handsome house, at the West end of the town, with suitable servants; for the furnishing of which the said Flaw engages to procure her credit.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have not I?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P><Q>“Secondly, that the said Flaw shall circulate, privately and publickly, in taverns, coffee-houses, Journals, Chronicles, Morning and Evening-Posts, and Courants, that the said Felicia is a person of great address and abi∣lities; and that, by means of many powerful connections, she is able to procure posts, places, preferments of all conditions and sizes; to raise cash for the indigent, and pro∣cure good securities for such as are wealthy; suitable matches for people who want hus∣bands and wives, and divorces sor those who wish to get rid of them.”</Q></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>And have not I persormed every tittle? have not my expences in attending plays, operas, masquerades, and Pantheons, not to mention subscription-money to most of the clubs, and coteries, amounted to a most enormous—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am near at an end.—<STAGE>[Reads.]</STAGE>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<Q>“That the said Flaw shall at all times advise the said Felicia how far she may go without incurring the law; for all which he is to receive out of the neat profits thirty <HI>per cent.”</HI></Q>—You see, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And don't you think <HI>that</HI> a very ample provision?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>But consider, madam, I have sacrificed my whole time to your business, and I don't believe the law has procured me—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>The law? What, a little, private agency at the Old Bailey? a wonderful sacrifice▪ fy, fy, Mr. Flaw!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>You are the last person, Mrs. Fleece'em, that should cast such a reflection as that: Unless <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mistake, my attendance there was pretty useful to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without my skill and address, your last voyage to America would have been changed to a much shorter trip.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>A tour to Tyburn, in a tim-whisky and two, would have concluded your travels.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you impertinent, infamous, petty-sogging puppy, it was through your ig∣norance that I was obliged to travel at all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mine?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not Alick Alibi, before your face, at Blackwall, in the Transport, declare, that he never saw such a bungling business; that if he had been employed—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>F<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>w.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alibi?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know him, I fancy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly: As, madam, you think him so wonderfully clever, you had better employ him; I am ready to resign, in his favour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is ungenerous in you, Mr. Flaw, to insult a gentleman under misfortunes: You know the clipping and filing affair compels him to keep a little private at present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, then, that's the reason I am con∣sulted? sweet madam, your servant! But, madam, I must desire you to find out some other agent: I declare off! you sha'n't make a stop-gap of me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our accounts are easily settled: Let me see! Seven pounds seven shillings, from the brewer's clerk, who is gone with your re∣commendatory letters to India.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nine pounds, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Seven. The rest paid out of my pocket to Kitt Copywell, for manufacturing the letters from the directors.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="6" REF="12"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well! Have you got the fellow aboard?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sailed the latter end of the week.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then there is the crimp's money, for procuring the company an able recruit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Already deducted, for promising to get Bob Blueskin a reprieve at the—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>These, Mr. Flaw, are but trifling affairs; they may be settled at some other time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am ready; whenever you please: And so, madam Fleecee'm, I am your most humble, and very—Oh! I had like to have forgot; if any thing should happen; that I may not be blamed, <HI>in futuro,</HI> I would advise you to take care of yourself: I overheard Luke Lockup; the turnkey, say, as you passed by in a coach, that he had some notion of having seen you before, and wanted much to know where you lodged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Luke Lockup? why, how is it possible he could—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know nothing of that: Foreseeing, indeed, that such a thing might possibly happen, I had provided a couple of people to prove that you were shipwreek'd on the Western coast; so that, though you were returned before your time from your travels, it was none of your
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
fault; but that is all over now; Mr. Alibi will, no doubt, take proper care.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, as to that, Mr. Flaw, there is no man living to whose care I would sooner trust myself than your own; but sure in this affair we have been both of us rather too quick. Let us coolly consider: I am sure, I am the furthest in the world from—But come; let us know what are your further demands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I scorn, madam, to take any advantage: As our risques and labour are equal, an equal partition; that's all.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I consent to the agreement.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very well. I will prepare a draft to lay before council; which, when approved, you will sign?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without scruple; that being settled, let us come a little to business. What new game have you sprung?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Plenty, plenty; the family I expected out of the country is come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Father, mother, and son! have you seen them?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I received their note but this instant: They have made a little mistake I believe as to their lodgings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>How so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I advised them, at their coming to
<PB N="8" REF="14"/>
town to stay at one of the Hotels for a week or ten days; instead of that, they are got to a Bagnio.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A Bagnio?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>At the sign of the Lamb, in Long-Acre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, for aught I know, that place will best answer our purpose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must step directly to the Salopian Coffee-House; Ensign Gaters is to send you a hundred for obtaining him a step in his corps. Here; I have brought you the complimentary cards to put over the chimney.</P>
<STAGE>[Gives her the cards.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's right. Let me see:<HI>—The Duke of—best respects—Earl of—Viscount—</HI>Ah, ah; very well! Have you prevailed on the coachman you mentioned?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has promised to parade before your house for an hour, after his master is set down at the Cockpit. A couple of servants to wait at the door, as if the great man was above, will be right.</P>
<STAGE>Enter a Servant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>A note, Sir, from a person below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let us see it.—<STAGE>[Reads.]</STAGE> <Q>“Mr. O' Flan∣nagan's compliments to Mr. Flaw, and as he perhaps may not choose to be at home to him,
<PB N="9" REF="15"/>
being at another body's house, begs to know where he may see him this evening.”</Q>—A bagatelle; some trifling affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>You had therefore better dispatch him at once. Shew him up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>He brought me a recommendatory letter this morning; but I was in a hurry, and desired him to meet me here about this time. Here he is.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Mr. O'Flannagan.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Flaw, I am your most humble sarvant. Madam, I am yours unknown.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Mr. O' Flannagan, what are your commands with me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, Mr. Flaw, we will postpone that, if you plase: I hope I am a little better bred than to mention any thing of my private affairs before ladies; their little ears, sweet craturs, should be tickled with nothing but love.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true; but here you may suspend your politeness a little; for, unless I am mis∣taken, it is to this lady's good offices you must be oblig'd in your present pursuit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! that indeed alters the case. Why then, madam, this is my business at once: You must understand I came over lately from Lime∣rick;
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
and there, upon my soul, all the world are gone mad about running beyond sea, in search after—I think it is <HI>emigrations</HI> they call them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard, indeed, that there has been a prodigious desertion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prodigious! upon my soul, madam, in a hundred miles riding, I did not meet with a human cratur, except sheep and oxen, to tell me the road; and I should have lost my∣self again and again, but for the mile-stones, that are so kind to answer your questions with∣out giving you the trouble to ask them: And so, being desirous to fellow my neighbours' ex∣ample, I have, madam, made bold to come over before them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right; one would not like to be last in the chase.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. Now, madam, as some emi∣grations must be better than other some, I should be glad to be recommended to one of the best.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, that will be no very difficult mat∣ter. Let me see! is the collector of the win∣dow-lights in Falkland's Island disposed of?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have not heard that it has been given away; but, however, if it should, the su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ship of the woods there is vacant, I am sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, madam, is that a lucra∣tive place, as to the profit?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Besides the salary, for perquisites you are to have all the loppings and toppings.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flew.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay? upon my word, if that can be got, you will be a happy man, Mr. O' Flan∣nagan.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Without doubt, I shall be in very good luck. But pray, madam, what was the name of the Falklands?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Falkland's Island.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Island! true, true. But, Mr. Flaw, is it a place one can go to by land? becaase why, I am not over-fond of the sea; coming over t'other day from Donechedy, it tumbled and jumbled, and rumbled me to such a degree!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Flaw—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am afraid it will be difficult.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, if it is equally the same, I should be glad to have an emigration in some other parts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There was a thing that I got yester∣day for a relation of mine, that would have suited this gentleman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, what might that be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A tidewaiter's place in the inland part of America.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="18"/>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Inland! that would just do to a T.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you may easily provide in some other way for your cousin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true; but then, you know, he has put himself to some expence, in fitting himself out for the—</P>

<P>Oh! I dare say Mr. O' Flannagan will be glad to reimburse him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O' Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>That I will; and give him a good spill for his resignation, into the bargain.</P>

Mr. Flaw, I presume, has mentioned our little affair.

<P>Hymn? then the Doctor sings, I presume.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not a better pipe at the playhouse; he has been long notorious for that: Then he is as chearful, and has such a choice collection of songs! why, he is constantly asked at the great city-feasts; and does, I verily believe, more in-door christnings than any three of the cloth. But this composition, madam, is of a different kind: It is but short; but if the party, your worthy friend and relation, should happen to like the manner of writing, he has a much longer one for his immediate perusal.—Madam, I am your obsequious, and very devoted—Not a step, my good Mr. Flaw! my chairmen are, you know, in waiting.</P>

<P>In the back dining-room, up one pair of stairs.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Will you let him know there is a person wishes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o see him? If he wants to know my name—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can tell him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay? why, have we been ever acquainted?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! have you forgot Tom, master Flaw, at the Crown and Rolls in Chancery-Lane?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I recollect. But I thought, by this time, you had set up for yourself: You seemed in a very good way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pretty well, master, for that part of the town: <Q>But, Lord, Sir, the penurious pence of the lawyers won't do for us, who are the superior knights of the napkin; after poring an hour over
<PB N="30" REF="36"/>
a six and eight-penny bill, “Here, Tom, give us change! and mind, there is a groat for yourself:”</Q> How was it possible to support a girl and a gelding upon such a two-penny tax? it could not be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is true, indeed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no. So, dipping pretty deeply in debt, I got a friendly commission of bankruptcy to discharge my old scores, and removed to this end of the town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where you thrive, without doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>To give you a sample—It was but last night, Sir Ralph Riot moved, that every man in the club should give the waiter two guineas a-piece, just by way of <HI>surprising</HI> the rascal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>And it was carried?</P>

<P>Oh, <HI>nem. con.—</HI>the members never flinch at a frolic.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wish you joy of your station!—But pray, by what accident came the family above to your house? There must have been some mistake in the matter; for they are people of very good reputation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't guess. Only that the town is thin, and business begins to grow dead, we should hardly have given them admittance; they are a strange unaccountable tribe: Pray who the deuce are they?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>A respectable family, from the county of Wilts, with a very good landed estate, I assure you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="31" REF="37"/>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>On which, I suppose, the 'squire con∣descends to kill his own meat; and madam, his lady, to dress it: Then it is one eternal wrangle between them, conducted in a language pretty near as coarse as their carter's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>They have been bred in a state of Nature, Tom.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The husband, for once or twice, is enter∣taining enough: He sets out to inform you in a most material point, as he thinks, which he for∣sakes in an instant to follow some other circum∣stance, not material at all; this he soon quits for another, and soon for another, if you will give him attention. He puts me in mind of a pack of hounds in a hare-warren; by eternally shifting the game, the pursuit never ends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have him, Tom; Mr. Aircastle is, I own, very prolix and digressive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Unless I am mistaken, the son has an old acquaintance here in the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Miss Betsy Blossom, one of our ladies, who comes, I fancy, from their part of the world: She wishes to avoid the father and mother, but hints that she has good reason to remember the son.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flaw.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perhaps so.</P>

<SP>

<P>Madam the mother too, who is still a jolly brisk dame, seems determined to make the most of her time.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Convinced me? Did not I tell you what parson Prunello said—I remember Mrs. Lightfoot was by—she had been brought to-bed, that day was a month, of a very fine boy—a bad birth; for Doctor Seeton, who served his time with Luke Lancet of Guise's—there was a talk about him and Nancy the daughter—she afterwards married Will Whitlow, another apprentice, who had great expectations from an old uncle in the Grenades; but he left all to a distant relation, Kit Cable, a midshipman aboard the Torbay—she was lost, coming home, in the Channel—the captain was taken up by a coaster from Rye, loaded with cheese—</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy upon me, Mr. Aircastle, at

what a rate you run on! What has all this to do with our coming to London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, I was going to tell you; but you will never have patience!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>More than ever woman possessed. Would you, I say, be contented to spring, grow, and decay, in the same country spot, like a cabbage?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; provided I left behind me some promising sprouts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! have you no ambition? no soul? could you be easy to stand stock-still, whilst your neighbours are advancing all round you? Cottagers are become farmers; farmers are made justices; and folks that travelled barefoot to London, roll down again in their coaches and chariots; but still we stick!</P>

<P>What then? For, as counsellor Crab said at the assizes—he came down to plead for Ned Nick'em, who won at Bath a large sum of Lord Luckless—the principal witness was Christopher Cogg'em—who was condemned to the pillory; but saved by Phil Fang the attor∣ney—who—</P>

my land to put your hopeful project in practice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well; and must not every body who ventures in the lottery of life first pay for his ticket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe Toby will hardly thank me for going into the wheel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I suppose he would rather stay at home, and marry Bet Blossom: A pretty alliance he had like to have given us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>But you know I drove the girl out of the parish.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are there none of the same stamp left behind?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, here we are, and what's to be done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our first business is to get Toby disposed of; upon your head, we will consult Mr. Flaw; as to my affairs, leave me to myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as for Toby, the best method, you think, will be—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>To advertise the boy, to be sure.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you think so? Advertise Toby? I was once told by Tom Type, a printer of one of the papers—he was tried for a libel before Sir Philip Flogg'em, at the Old-Bailey—two of the jury died that sessions of the distemper—doctor Drybones recommended vinegar by way
<PB N="36" REF="42"/>
of prevention—the Doctor wore the strangest black wigs!—they were made by Ben Block'em, of Bow-Street—I dined with him once, when he was churchwarden, upon two bastard children—we had a haunch of venison—the venison was over-roasted, and stunk—but doctor Dewlap twisted down such gobs of fat—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what is all this to the purpose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was going to tell you, if you would but listen a bit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>That he never knew any good come of that kind of—</P>

<P>Bravo, bravo, my sweet country ac∣quaintance! this is a rendezvous, with a witness. Let me see! <HI>Um, um, um!</HI> <Q>“Unexpectedly brought by business to town—no time to make a proper provision—accommodate me with Five Hundred Guineas”</Q>—accommodate! an apt phrase, and a pretty sum too; but how the deuce could the woman suppose that I was able to advance such a sum? <HI>Um, um!—</HI><Q>“Not prove ungrateful—Elizabeth”</Q>—Oh, ho! now I begin to conceive.—Stay! who have we here? Zooks! the husband himself.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Aircastle.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, colonel Gorget!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Aircastle, I am happy to see you! But what important business can have brought you to London?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some family affairs, and to lay out a pretty large sum, which I lately got for a parcel of land.—But is this visit intended to me?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I was quite a stranger to your
<PB N="45" REF="51"/>
being in town. A lady in the house, that I lately knew in the country—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>What, from our part of the world?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no; but a devilish fine woman: Last summer some little gallantries past between us below.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay; you officers play the very deuce when you come down into the country. I re∣member ensign Sash, about ten years ago—his father came from Barbadoes—I met him at Treacle's, the great sugar-baker's, who had a house in St. Mary-Axe—he took the lease from alderman Gingham, who served sheriff with deputy—there was tight work on the hustings—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the devil! he runs on at the old rate.—But we forget the lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, ay; "Gallantry with her below;" which I suppose you have finished above.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, faith, not entirely, my friend; but I think we are in a fair way.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>The garrison has offered to surrender.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then what prevented you from taking possession?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>The governor, as usual, insists on a bribe, which it was not immediately in my power to pay—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Damn those governors!—why, there was
<PB N="46" REF="52"/>
the governor of Bergen-op-zoom, in the last war—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hear me!—I was just stepping home to provide the credentials; but, however, this lucky meeting will, I flatter myself, put an end to my journey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>As how?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you will supply me with the sum till evening, I shall close the bargain without quitting the house.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>How much?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five hundred guineas.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Five hundred guineas? what a cormo∣rant the woman must be!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all, when her husband is rich, and she is above accepting a trifle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, I should have thought that would have made her more reasonable.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Quite the reverse; why, did you ever know a wealthy courtier accept of a moderate pension?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, indeed—But are you really se∣rious?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>So serious, that if you will lend me the money—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but, colonel, that is—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but if you hesitate—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, it is not that; the money is quite at
<PB N="47" REF="53"/>
your service; but you will repent, and then re∣proach me—What! five hundred? there can be no woman worth it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>You would alter your tone, if you saw her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Should I? Prithee tell me her name; perhaps I may know her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>I durst not; you know my honour is concerned.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour with such a woman as that?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is very well known.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>And ought to be better.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>But I waste time, and may lose the critical minute: Will you supply me, or must I—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>With the greatest pleasure in life: Here is in this bag the very sum, which I have just received for a draft in the city.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ten thousand thanks, my dear Mr.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't say tho', but I am sorry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, it is not impossible but I may come off at an easier rate: With such a capital in hand, one may haggle, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true; I'd endeavour to get her for nothing: Chouse her, chouse her! do, colonel. If indeed she had asked for a ring with a poesy, or any such trifle as that—but such a monstrous demand! I would give something to see her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="48" REF="54"/>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, it is my opinion you know who she is.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Really?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now if it should turn out that you had been happy with the lady yourself, would not that greatly surprise you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Me? ha, ha, ha! the deuce a bit: Tho', when I came first to the Temple, there was a lawyer's wife that lived in Quality-Court, that I was exceedingly fond of—her husband came home one night, and I crept under the bed, where I should have remained concealed, but for a little dog of Charles's breed; he went <HI>bow, wow, wow—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, the devil!—But consider, time presses; I must away to the lady.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, true; and I to the shops with my boy. And I happywith the—ha, ha, ha—However, if that be the case, colonel, it is a stronger rea∣son for closing your purse-strings; for the devil take me if I ever knew a woman who was deserv∣ing a tythe of that sum in my life!—Yes; I lie! I did; a Greek girl, they called Circassian—I saw her at Tunbridge—where, by the bye, they have the oddest pantile walk—with the musick on a shelf—and as the company walk to and fro, the fidlers go <HI>tal, lal, la—</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, but—<STAGE>[pushing him out].</STAGE> This is lucky beyond expectation; what a civilized hus∣band, to supply me with the very money I wanted!</P>

<P>And the wisest step you could take.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pardon me, Sir! I am not to learn how dangerous it is to have an obligation to you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why so? Can there be any thing more natural than to desire the assistance of the

person who loves us? Of my attachment I hope you have no reason to doubt.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, is the very source of my sorrow, and has determined me to support every evil; nay, to apply even to Mr. Aircastle him∣self, rather than—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, madam! them it is plain I have lost your esteem. Fool that I was, to be lulled by the bewitching lines of your letter! I thought that I had detected Love, that sly lurcher, lurk∣ing under the mask of confidential—But now I unfortunately find how far I am from your favour.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prig.</SPEAKER>
<P>I consider it, madam, as one of the most greatestest pieces of happiness that could have befallen Paul Prig. Your la'ship is a perfect pattern of humility: To suffer a simple tradesman like me to occupy part of your la'ship's coach, is such an honour that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Honour? by no means, Mr. Prig: I don't know a station more useful, or indeed more reputable, than that of a citizen like you,

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think more so, of late.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helle.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, the great tension of the Pia-mater must enseeble the system; and the paroxisms, of course, oftener repeated, and of longer continuance. And his whims, you say—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To the last degree extravagant: Last week he supposed himself a young nestling crow, and constantly opened his mouth, like a bill, and cawed for food, when he found himself hungry.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helle.</SPEAKER>
<P>A manifest mark of distraction!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if that should not be the case, Sir?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Helle.</SPEAKER>
<P>The best way, ma'am, is to leave him to my care a little: I have a convenient house not far from town, where mad people are managed with greater advantage.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall submit his treatment entirely to you.—But I suppose, Sir, it will be right for me to withdraw, as you may have some questions to ask him, improper for the ear of a lady. I will pay a short visit, now I am in this part of the town.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pray, madam, is the young lady at home?</P>

<P>Dear Mr. Aircastle, what has all this to do with the young lady's illness?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>I was coming to that, my soul, if you will let me. I don't know how it happens; in general, nobody is better bred than Mrs. Air∣castle; but to-day she won't let me bring out a word.—So, madam, Tom Truant, as I was—</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can't suffer it, upon this lady's account.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>It was for her sake, my soul, I was speak∣ing.—So, madam, Tom Truant—</P>

<P>If you persist, I shall quit the house, I assure you!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>All I meant was for the service of Miss.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very obliging, indeed. I should be sorry if any disference should arise on my niece's account; Besides, her illness is so trifling, that the young gentleman may, if he pleases, step into her room to enquire after her health.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Toby will be very happy, I am sure. You see, madam, what the lad is.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>A most agreeable youth, I must own; and then his silence is a modest mark of his merit.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you hear that, Mrs. Air—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and I hope it will make a proper impression on you.—You, doubtless, madam, know the taste of your niece; may we hope that Toby has any chance of succeeding?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was prodigiously pleased with Mr. Flaw's account of his parents; which, in∣deed, I now find to be true in every respect.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air. and Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, madam!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And as to fortune, she is totally careless in that, her own being much more than sufficient.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>How manly that is in a woman!—I re∣member Miss Patty Plumb of Jamaica did the very same—they say her grandfather was trans∣ported for robbing a hen-roost—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as to his figure, madam; do you apprehend it will strike her? Toby, hold up your head!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can see no reason against it: Indeed, the young gentleman has rather a sairer com∣plexion than what she has been commonly used
<PB N="76" REF="82"/>
to; the natives of India, from their climate, have rather a fallower hue.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, if necessary, that may be easily altered by art; some saffron, or snuff, just skimmed over his sace—</P>

<P>Mr. Flaw, will you ring for a candle?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>There is no necessity now: We have been obliged to shut out the light, as her eyes are rather tender and weak, with looking so long on nothing but water.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>True, madam. Well, madam, we will detain you no longer: I am sure it is im∣possible to say how much we are obliged—you may rely upon it, we shall ever be grateful.</P>

<P>I don't in the least doubt it: Mr. Flaw has, I presume, hinted my situation?</P>

Upper end of the room! and how the deuce should I know which that is? in the night, I can tell you, I should be a good deal frightened to be so much in the dark, but it is well enough in the day, when one is about to make love; because why, one is not so bashful and shy; one can see to speak one's mind with more boldness and cou∣rage, than in the light.—Me—Miss!

That's high enough, I believe.—That there thing in the leather-case is a watch; if you touch the nob that juts out, it strikes all the world like a clock; mother has one, but then him is as big as a warm∣ing-pan.

<P>By what Mrs. Aircastle has told me, I shrewdly suspect you are got into the hands of some villainous sharpers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Flaw, and his coadjutrix.—Within! who's there?—But we shall soon get the business explained.</P>
<STAGE>Enter a Servant.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do you live with the person who inhabits this house?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But a very short time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>We wish to see her directly.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Serv.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is gone out.</P>

<P>I thought so: And her niece too, I suppose?</P>

<P>Her niece, Sir?</P>

<SPEAKER>Air. and Mrs. Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>How!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as I suspected: Now, Sir, do you begin to find what a situation you are in?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then I am totally ruined! I told you, Mrs. Aircastle, what would come of your—I remember Martin Moneytrap, of the Minories, was once in the very same way—he was taken-in by a Portuguese Jew—</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>A truce to recrimination, I beg! we

<P>Pray step in a bit, if you plase, and refund freely the bill; or, upon my soul, I'll make you do me the favour by force!</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>All.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mrs. Fleece'em?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes; it is, sure enough; she overtook me, as I met her hard by.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are obliged to you then for the lady's return?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>O'Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>You may say that: I stopped her just in the nick, as she was s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily walking off in a coach. Arrah, put off your hood, my dear honey; don't be shame-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced amongst your friends and acq<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ntance.</P>

<P>Stand off, you rude brute!</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>O'Flan.</SPEAKER>
<P>Better words, if you plase! You wanted to send me to be feathered abroad; so, in return, I shall beg lave, madam, to pluck you at home.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>No violence to the lady I beg, Sir! she now finds she is detected, and, I dare say, will do every body all the justice she can. And, first, madam, as to the capital sum which you had the address to obtain from this—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="89" REF="95"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>What concern have I in the busi∣ness? the gentleman himself gave it into the possession of Flaw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Aircastle!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's true, I confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, since that, has not the property suffered a transfer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not to me: But if you doubt it, you may search the house when you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it has got into worse hands, I'm afraid.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Mrs. Simony.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I see by their confusion my infor∣mation was right.—Not to interrupt you, madam, I should take it as a particular favour if you would immediately return the little note I left in your hands—for I have not a moment to spare.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Note, madam? what note? I re∣collect, indeed, a hymn that you—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, madam, that hymn, if you please.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I gave it directly to Flaw, to get a friend of his to set it to musick.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>Musick? Ladies and gentlemen, a bank-note, I protest!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="90" REF="96"/>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! set a bank-note to musick? I never heard of such a thing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>And pray, madam, what could induce you to trust that woman with a bank-note?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That she will not so readily own; a little earnest of a much larger bribe, to procure her husband a living.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, madam! I hope your husband was not apprised of this application?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Doctor was totally ignorant; knew nothing about it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am very happy to hear it: I should be sorry to find that a gentleman, whose pecu∣liar duty it is to sustain the purity of his pro∣fession, should himself be the very person to soil it; or that an office of so sacred a nature, should be solicited by such unsanctified means.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Sim.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe my Doctor, Sir, will be hardly suspected: But I have not time to say more for the prefent; I shall be stay'd for, and have not a moment to spare.</P>
<STAGE>[Exit.</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let her go! that plunder, however, is fair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well! but, colonel, notwith∣standing all that you say, I have heard there was a bet once made between the patron of a living and one Parson Plurality—Plurality had
<PB N="91" REF="97"/>
been a Presbyterian—his father keeps a pastry-cook's shop in Spring-gardens—just where Cox's Museum—by the bye, they tell me, Cox will get devilish rich by his lottery.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if we don't use some dispatch, I am afraid you will get devilish poor.</P>
<STAGE>Enter Prig, in a waistcoat and cap.</STAGE>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is this damn'd infernal—she is burrow'd here, but I'll make her—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Who the deuce can this be?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some madman escaped from his keepers, I reckon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Prig.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, yes, I am escaped! but not mad: and if there is law to be had, I'll make you to know—keepers!—if I had not luckily met with some friends at the t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnpike, I should have been kept pretty close, I believe. I recollected your footman that stood at the door, and guess'd you were not far off.</P>

<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Zounds! I hope the boy is not married.</P>

<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; but they would have been, if I had not come just in the nick to fetch un away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Roger.</SPEAKER>
<P>In a shop at the corner. I wanted un to step over; but he would not, because why, he says as how the house is haunted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>And why not? There was the manor-house in the parish of Paddington—Mrs. Air∣castle, you may remember it formerly belonged to the Jessops; but, by the marriage of the heiress with one of the Haslewoods—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, it is a lucky prevention; and, to give you a little consolation, I believe I shall be able to recover your money from Flaw.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Air. and Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>How, colonel?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>I took the liberty, by way of preven∣tion, to get him secured for the money received of my ensign.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>And, as this affair is rather of a crimi∣nal nature, he will think himself happy to escape by restoring the plunder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Air.</SPEAKER>
<P>My kind colonel!</P>
</SP>
<SP>

amends for your disappointment in the five hun∣dred pounds.</P>

<P>Did this woman receive it?</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Fl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Flaw had it; but it wants some days of being due.</P>

<P>Then we shall be able to stop the pay∣ment, at least; it is safe, never fear.</P>

<P>That's lucky, however: And, by all I can hear, my best way, Mr. Colonel, will be to make an emigration back to Ireland again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Gorget.</SPEAKER>
<P>By all means; and, by this time, many more of your countrymen would, I believe, be glad to follow your steps.</P>

<P>What, to vegetate, like a parcel of plants?</P>

<P>Ay, madam; for there are trees that won't bear transplanting; they thrive best in their natural soil.</P>
