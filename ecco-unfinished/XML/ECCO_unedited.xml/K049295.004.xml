<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1689.</NOTE> THE constitution of England had now assumed a new aspect. The maxim of hereditary, indefeasible right, was at length re∣nounced by a free parliament. The power of the crown was acknowledged to flow from no other fountain than that of a contract with the people. Allegiance and protection were declared reciprocal ties depending upon each other. The representatives of the nation made a regular claim of rights in behalf of their constituents; and William III. ascended the throne in consequence of an express capitulation with the people. Yet on this occasion, the zeal of the parliament towards their deliverer, seems to have overshot their attachment to their own liberty and privileges: or at least they neglected the fairest opportunity that ever occurred, to retrench those prerogatives of the crown to which they imputed all the late and former calamities of the king∣dom. Their new monarch retained the old regal power over parliaments, in its full extent. He was left at liberty to convoke, adjourn, prorogue, and dis∣solve them at his pleasure. He was enabled to influence elections and oppress corporations. He possessed the right of chusing his own council; of nominat∣ing all the great officers of the state, and of the houshold, of the army, the navy, and the church. He reserved the absolute command of the militia: so that he remained master of all the instruments and engines of corruption and violence, without any other restraint than his own moderation, and pru∣dent regard to the claim of rights and principle of resistance on which the re∣volution was founded. In a word, the settlement was finished with some precipitation, before the plan had been properly digested and matured; and this will be the case in every establishment formed upon a sudden emergency in the face of opposition. It was observed, that the king, who was made by the people, had it in his power to rule without them; to govern jure divino, though he was created jure humano; and that, though the change proceeded from a republican spirit, the settlement was built upon tory maxims; for, the execution of his government continued still independent of his commission, while his own person remained sacred and inviolable. The prince of Orange had been invited to England by a coalition of parties, united by a common sense of danger; but this tie was no sooner broken, than they flew asunder, and each resumed its original biass. Their mutual jealousy and rancour re∣vived, and was heated by dispute into intemperate zeal and enthusiasm. Those who at first acted from principles of patriotism, were insensibly warmed into partisans; and king William soon found himself at the head of a faction. As he had been bred a calvinist, and always expressed an abhorrence of spiritual
<PB N="3" REF="60"/>
persecution, the presbyterians, and other protestant dissenters, considered him as their peculiar protector, and entered into his interests with the most zealous fervour and assiduity. For the same reasons, the friends of the church be∣came jealous of his proceedings, and employed all their influence, first in op∣posing his elevation to the throne, and afterwards in thwarting his measures. Their party was espoused by all the friends of the lineal succession; by the ro∣man catholics; by those who were personally attached to the late king, and by such as were disgusted by the conduct and personal deportment of William since his arrival in England. They observed, That contrary to his declaration, he had plainly aspired to the crown; and treated his father-in-law with inso∣lence and rigour: That his army contained a number of foreign papists, almost equal to that of the English roman catholics whom James had employed: that the reports so industriously circulated about the birth of the prince of Wales, the treaty with France for enslaving England, and the murder of the earl of Essex; reports countenanced by the prince of Orange, now appeared to be without foundation: That the Dutch troops remained in London, while the English forces were distributed in remote quarters: That the prince de∣clared the first should be kept about his person, and the latter sent to Ireland: That the two houses, out of complaisance to William, had denied their late so∣vereign the justice of being heard in his own defence; and, That the Dutch had lately interfered with the trade of London, which was already sensibly di∣minished. These were the sources of discontent, swelled up by the resentment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Somers's Col∣lection. Reresby. Burnet.</NOTE> of some noblemen, and other individuals, disappointed in their hopes of profit and preferment.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>William began his reign with a proclamation, for confirming all pro∣testants in the offices which they enjoyed on the first day of December: then he chose the members of his council, who were generally staunch to his in∣terest, except the archbishop of Canterbury and the earl of Nottingham <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The council consisted of the prince of Den∣mark, the archbishop of Canterbury, the duke of Norfolk, the marquisses of Hallifax and Win∣chester, the earls of Danby, Lindsey, Devon∣shire, Dorset, and Middlesex, Oxford, Shrews∣bury, Bedford, Bath, Macclesfield, Nottingham; the viscounts Falconberge, Mordaunt, Newport, Lumley; the lords Wharton, Montague, Dela∣mere, Churchill; Mr. Bentinck, Mr. Sidney, Sir Robert Howard, Sir Henry Capel, Mr. Powle, Mr. Russel, Mr. Hambden, and Mr. Boscawen.</NOTE>; and these were admitted in complaisance to the church-party, which it was not thought adviseable to provoke. Nottingham and Shrewsbury were appointed secretaries of state: the privy-seal was bestowed upon the marquis of Hallifax: the earl of Danby was created president of the council. These two noblemen enjoyed a good share of the king's confidence; and Nottingham was con∣siderable as head of the church-party: but the chief favourite was Bentinck, first commoner on the list of privy-counsellors, as well as groom of the stole and privy purse. D'Auverquerque was made master of the horse, Zuylestein of the robes, and Schomberg of the ordnance: the treasury, admiralty, and chancery, were put in commission; twelve able judges were chosen <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir John Holt was appointed lord chief jus∣tice of the king's-bench, and Sir Henry Pollexfen of the common-pleas; the earl of Devonshire was made lord-steward of the houshold, and the earl of Dorset lord-chamberlain. <BIBL>Ralph.</BIBL></NOTE>; and the diocese of Salisbury being vacated by the death of doctor Ward, the king, of his own free motion, filled it with Burnet, who had been a zealous stickler for his interest; and, in a particular manner, instrumental in effecting the revolution. Sancroft archbishop of Canterbury refused to consecrate this ecclesiastic,
<PB N="4" REF="70"/>
though the reasons of his refusal are not specified; but, being afraid of incurring the penalties of a premu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, he granted a commission to the bi∣shop of London, and three other suffragans, to perform that ceremony. Burnet was a prelate of some parts, and great industry; moderate in his notions of church discipline, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> meddling, vain, and credulous. In consequence of having incurred the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the late king, he had retired to the con∣tinent, and fixed his residence in Holland, where he was naturalized, and at∣tached himself to the interest of the prince of Orange, who consulted him about the affairs of England. He assisted in drawing up the prince's manifesto, and wrote some other papers and pamphlets in defence of his design. He was demanded of the states, by the English ambassador, as a British fugitive, out∣lawed by king James, and excepted in the act of indemnity: nevertheless, he came over with William, in quality of his chaplain; and, by his intrigues, contributed in some measure to the success of that expedition. The prin∣cipal individuals that composed this ministry, have been characterised in the history of the preceding reigns. We have had occasion to mention the fine talents, the vivacity, the flexibility of Hallifax; the pl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usibility, the enterpris∣ing genius, the obstinacy of Danby; the pompous eloquence, the warmth, and ost<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntation of Nottingham; the probity and popularity of Shrewsbury. Go∣dolphin, now brought into the treasury, was modest, silent, sagacious, and up∣right. Mordau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, appointed first commissioner of that board, and afterwards created earl of Monmouth, was open, generous, and a republican in his princi∣ples. Delamere, chancellor of the exchequer, promoted in the sequel to the rank of earl of Warrington, was close and mercenary. Obsequiousness, fidelity, and attachment to his master, composed the character of Bentinck, whom the king raised to the dignity of earl of Portland. The English favourite Sidney was a man of wit and pleasure, possessed of the most engaging talents for con∣versation and private friendship, but rendered unfit for public business by in∣dolence and inattention. He was ennobled, and afterwards created earl of Romney, a title which he enjoyed with several successive posts of profit and im∣portance. The stream of honour and preferment ran strong in favour of the Whigs, and this appearance of partiality confirmed the suspicion and resent∣ment of the opposite party.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The first resolution taken in the new council was to convert the convention into a parliament, that the new settlement might be strength∣ened by a legal sanction, which was now supposed to be wanting, as the assem∣bly had not been convoked by the king's writ of summons. The experiment of a new election was deemed too hazardous; therefore, the council determined that the king should, by virtue of his own authority, change the convention into a parliament, by going to the house of peers with the usual state of a sovereign, and pronouncing a speech from the throne to both houses. This expedient was accordingly practised. He assured them he should never take any step that would diminish the good opinion they had conceived of his integrity. He told them that Holland was in such a situation as required their immediate attention and assistance: that the posture of affairs at home likewise demanded their seri∣ous consideration: that a good settlement was necessary not only for the esta∣blishment of domestic peace, but also for the support of the protestant interest abroad: that the affairs of Ireland were too critically situated to admit of the least delay in their deliberations: he therefore begged they would be speedy and effectual in concerting such measures as should be judged indispensably necessary
<PB N="5" REF="80"/>
for the welfare of the nation. The commons returning to their house, imme∣diately passed a vote of thanks to his majesty, and made an order that his speech should be taken into consideration. After the throne had been declared vacant by a small majority of the peers, those who opposed that measure had gradually withdrawn themselves from the house; so that very few remained but such as were devoted to the new monarch. These therefore brought in a bill for pre∣venting all disputes concerning the present parliament. In the mean time, Mr. Hambden in the lower house, put the question, Whether a king elected by the lords spiritual and temporal, and the commons assembled at Westminster, com∣ing to, and consulting with the said lords and commons, did not make as com∣plete a parliament, and legislative power and authority, as if the said king should cause new elections to be made by writ? Many members affirmed, that the king's writ was as necessary as his presence to the being of a legal parliament; and as the convention was defective in this particular, it could not be vested with a parlia∣mentary authority by any management whatsoever. The Whigs replied, That the essence of a parliament consisted in the meeting and co-operation of the king, lords, and commons; and that it was not material whether they were convoked by writ or by letter: they proved this assertion by examples deduced from the history of England: they observed, that a new election would be attended with great trouble, expence, and loss of time; and that such delay might prove fatal to the protestant interest in Ireland, as well as to the allies on the continent. In the midst of this debate, the bill was brought down from the lords, and being read, a committee was appointed to make some amendments. These were no sooner made than the commons sent it back to the upper house, and it imme∣diately received the royal assent. By this act the lords and commons assembled at Westminster were declared the two houses of parliament, to all intents and purposes: it likewise ordained, That the present act and all other acts to which the royal assent should be given before the next prorogation, should be understood and adjudged in law to begin on the thirteenth day of February: That the members, instead of the old oaths of allegiance and supremacy, should take the new oath incorporated in this act under the antient penalty; and, That the present parliament should be dissolved in the usual manner. Immediately after this transaction, a warm debate arose in the house of commons about the re∣venue which the courtiers alledged had devolved with the crown upon Wil∣liam, at least, during the life of James; for which term the greater part of it had been granted. Those in the opposition affirmed, that those grants were vacated with the throne; and at length it was voted, That the revenue had expired. Then a motion was made, That a revenue should be settled on the king and queen; and the house resolved it should be taken into consideration. While they deliberated on this affair, they received a message from his majesty, importing, that the late king had set sail from Brest with an armament to invade Ireland. They forthwith resolved to assist his majesty with their lives and for∣tunes; they voted a temporary aid of four hundred and twenty thousand pounds, to be levied by monthly assessment; and both houses waited on the king, to sig∣nify this resolution. But this unanimity did not take place, until several lords spiritual as well as temporal, had, rather than take the oaths, absented them∣selves from parliament. The nonjuring prelates were Sancroft, archbishop of Canterbury; Turner, bishop of Ely; Lake, of Chichester; Ken, of Bath and
<PB N="$" REF="90"/>
Wells; White, of Peterborough; Loyd, of Norwich; Thomas, of Worcester; and Frampton, of Gloucester. The temporal peers who refused the oath, were the duke of Newcastle, the earls of Clarendon, Litchfield, Exeter, Yarmouth, and Stafford; the lords Griffin and Stawel. Five of the bishops withdrew themselves from the house at one time; but, before they retired, one of the number moved for a bill of toleration, and another of comprehension, by which moderate dissenters might be reconciled to the church, and admitted into eccle∣sia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tical benefices. Such bills were actua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly prepared and presented by the earl of Nottingham, who received the thanks of the house for the pains he had taken. From this period, the party averse to the government of William were distinguished by the appellation of Nonjurors. They rejected the notion of a king de facto, as well as all other distinctions and limitations; and declared for the absolute power, and divine hereditary indefeasible right of sovereigns.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>This faction had already begun to practise against the new government. The king having received some intimation of their designs, from intercepted letters, ordered the earl of Arran, Sir Robert Hamilton, and some other gen∣tlemen of the Scottish nation to be apprehended, and sent prisoners to the Tower. Then he informed the two houses of the step he had taken, and even craved their advice with regard to his conduct in such a delicate affair, which had com∣pelled him to trespass upon the law of England. The lords thanked him for the care he took of their liberties, and desired he would secure all disturbers of the peace; but, the commons impowered him by a bill to dispense with the Habeas corpus act, till the seventeenth day of April next ensuing. This was a stretch of confidence in the crown which had not been made in favour of the late king, even while Argyle and Monmouth were in open rebellion A spirit of discontent had by this time diffussed itself through the army, and become so formidable to the court, that the king resolved to retain the Dutch troops in England, and send over to Holland in their room such regiments as were most tinctured with disaffection. Of these the Scottish regiment of Dumbarton, com∣manded by marechal Schomberg, mutinied on its march to Ipswich, seized the military chest, disarmed the officers who opposed their design, declared for king James, and with four pieces of cannon, began their march for Scotland. Wil∣liam being informed of this revolt, ordered general Ginkle to pursue them with three regiments of Dutch dragoons; and the mutineers surrendered at discre∣tion. As the delinquents were natives of Scotland, which had not yet submit∣ted in form to the new government, the king did not think proper to punish them as rebels, but ordered them to proceed for Holland, according to his first intention. Though this attempt proved abortive, it made a strong impression upon the ministry, who were divided among themselves, and wavered in their principles. However, they seized this opportunity to bring in a bill for punishing mutiny and deser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion, which in a little time passed both houses, and received the royal assent.</P>

king's desire, in the room of the metropolitan, who was a malecontent; and next day the commons, in a body, waited on the king and queen at Whitehall, with an address of congratulation. William, with a view to conciliate the af∣fection of his new subjects, and check the progress of clamour and discontent, signified, in a solemn message to the house of commons, his readiness to acquiesce in any measure they should think proper to take for a new regulation or total suppression of the hearth-money, which he understood was a grievous imposition on the subjects; and this tax was afterwards abolished. He was gratified with an address of thanks, couched in the warmest expressions of duty, gratitude, and affection, declaring they would take such measures in support of his crown as would convince the world that he reigned in the hearts of his people.</P>

<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>He had, in his answer to their former address, assured them of his con∣stant regard to the rights and prosperity of the nation: he had explained the exhausted state of the Dutch, expatiated upon the zeal of that republic for the interests of Britain, and the maintenance of the protestant religion; expressed his hope that the English parliament would not only repay the sums they had expended in his expedition; but, likewise farther support them to the utmost of their ability against the common enemies of their liberties and religion. He had observed that a considerable army and fleet would be necessary for the reduction of Ireland, and the protection of Britain; and he desired they would settle the revenue in such a manner, that it might be collected without difficulty and dis∣pute. The sum total of the money expended by the states-general in William's expedition, amounted to seven millions of guilders, and the commons granted six hundred thousand pounds for the discharge of this debt, incurred for the pre∣servation of their rights and religion. They voted funds for raising and main∣taining an army of two and twenty thousand men, as well as for equipping a nu∣merous fleet; but, they provided for no more than half a year's subsistence of the troops, hoping the reduction of Ireland might be finished in that term; and this instance of frugality the king considered as a mark of their diffidence of his administration. The Whigs were resolved to supply him gradually, that he might be the more dependent upon their zeal and attachment; but, he was not at all pleased with their precaution.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>William was naturally biassed to calvinism, and averse to persecution. Whatever promises he had made, and whatever sentiments of respect he enter∣tained for the church of England, he seemed now in a great measure alienated from it, by the opposition he had met with from its members, particularly from the bishops who had thwarted his measures; who had, by absenting themselves from parliament, and refusing the oath, plainly disowned his title, and renounced his government. He therefore resolved to mortify the church, and gratify his own friends at the same time, by removing the obstacles affixed to nonconformity, that all protestant dissenters should be rendered capable of enjoying and exercising
<PB N="8" REF="110"/>
civil employments. When he gave his assent to the bill for suspending the Habeas corpus act, he recommended the establishment of a new oath in lieu of those of allegiance and supremacy: he expressed his hope that they would leave room for the admission of all his protestant subjects who should be found quali∣fied for the service: he said, such a conjunction would unite them the more firmly among themselves, and strengthen them against their common adversa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>es. In consequence of this hint, a clause was inserted in the bill for abrogat∣ing the old and appointing the new oaths, by which the sacramental test was de∣clared unnecessary in rendering any person capable of enjoying any office or em∣ployment. It was, however, rejected by a great majority in the house of lords. Another clause for the same purpose, though in different terms, was proposed by the king's direction, and met with the same fate, though in both cases several noblemen entered a protest against the resolution of the house. These fruitless efforts in favour of dissenters, augmented the prejudice of the church∣men against king William, who would have willingly compromised the diffe∣rence, by excusing the clergy from the oaths, provided the dissenters might be exempted from the sacramental test; but, this was deemed the chief bulwark of the church, and therefore the proposal was rejected. The church-party in the house of lords moved, that instead of inserting a clause, obliging the clergy to take the oaths, the king should be impowered to tender them; and in case of their refusal, they should incur the penalty, because deprivation or the appre∣hensions of it, might make them desperate, and excite them to form designs against the government. This argument had no weight with the commons, who thought it was indispensably necessary to exact the oaths of the clergy, as their example influenced the kingdom in general, and the youth of the nation were formed under their instructions. After a long and warm debate, all the miti∣gation that could be obtained, was a clause to impower the king to indulge any twelve clergymen deprived by virtue of this act, with a third part of their benefices during pleasure. Thus the antient oaths of allegiance and supremacy were abrogated; the declaration of non-resistance in the act of uniformity, was repealed: the new oath of allegiance was reduced to its primitive simplicity; and the coronation-oath rendered more explicit. The clergy were injoined to take the new oaths before the first day of August, on pain of being suspended from their office for six months, and of intire deprivation, in case they should not take them before the expiration of this term. They generally complied, though with such reservations and distinctions as were not much for the honour of their sincerity.</P>

<P>The king, though baffled in his design against the sacramental test, resolved to indulge the dissenters with a toleration; and a bill for this purpose being prepared by the earl of Nottingham, was, after some debate, passed into a law, under the title of, An act for exempting their majesties protestant subjects dissenting from the church of England, from the penalties of certain laws. It enacted<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That none of the penal laws should be construed to extend to those dis∣senters who should take the oaths to the present government, and subscribe the declaration of the thirtieth year in the reign of Charles II. provided, that they should hold no private assemblies or conventicles with the doors shut; and that nothing should be construed to exempt them from the payment of tythes or other parochial duties: That, in case of being chosen in the offices of constable,
<PB N="9" REF="120"/>
church-warden, overseer, &amp;c. and of scrupling to take the oaths annexed to such offices, they should be allowed to execute the employment by deputy: That the preachers and teachers in congregations of dissenting protestants, who shall take the oaths, subscribe the declaration, together with all the articles of religion, except the thirty-fourth and the two succeeding articles, and part of the twen∣tieth, should be exempted from the penalties decreed against nonconformists, as well as from serving upon juries, or acting in parish-offices: yet all justices of the peace were impowered to require such dissenters to subscribe the declara∣tion, and take the oaths; and in case of refusal, to commit them to prison, with∣out bail or mainprize. The same indulgence was extended to anabaptists, and even to quakers, on their solemn promise, before God, to be faithful to the king and queen, and their assenting by profession and asseveration to those articles which the others ratified upon oath: they were likewise required to profess their belief in the Trinity and the Holy Scriptures. Even the papists felt the benign influence of William's moderation in spiritual matters: he rejected the proposals of some zealots, who exhorted him to enact severe laws against popish recusants. Such a measure, he observed, would alienate all the papists of Eu∣rope from the interests of England, and might produce a new catholic league, which would render the war a religious quarrel; besides, he could not pretend to screen the protestants of Germany and Hungary, while he himself should persecute the catholics of England. He therefore resolved to treat them with lenity; and though they were not comprehended in the act, they enjoyed the be∣nefit of the toleration.</P>

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>We have observed, that in consequence of the motion made by the bi∣shops when they withdrew from parliament, a bill was brought into the house of lords, for uniting their majesties protestant subjects. This was extremely agree∣able to the king, who had the scheme of comprehension very much at heart. In the progress of the bill a warm debate arose about the posture of kneeling at the sacrament, which was given up in favour of the dissenters. Another, no less violent, ensued upon the subsequent question, <Q>“Whether there should be an addition of laity in the commission to be given by the king to the bishops and others of the clergy, for preparing such a reformation of ecclesiastical affairs as might be the means of healing divisions, and correcting whatever might be crroneous or defective in the constitution?”</Q> A great number of the temporal lords insisted warmly on this addition, and when it was rejected, four peers en∣tered a formal protest. Bishop Burnet was a warm stickler for the exclusion of the laity; and, in all probability, manifested this warmth in hope of ingratiating himself with his brethren, among whom his character was very far from being popular. But, the merit of this sacrifice was destroyed by the arguments he had used for dispensing with the posture of kneeling at the sacrament; and by his propos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing in another proviso of the bill, that the subscribers, instead of expressing assent and consent, should only submit, with a promise of conformity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>The bill was with difficulty passed in the house of lords: but the commons treated it with neglect. By this time a great number of malecontent members, who had retired from parliament, were returned, with a view to thwart the administration, though they could not prevent the settlement. In∣stead of proceeding with the bill, they presented an address to the king, thank∣ing him for his gracious declaration, and repeated assurances, that he would
<PB N="10" REF="130"/>
maintain the church of England as by law established; a church whose doctrine and practice had evinced its loyalty beyond all contradiction. They likewise humbly besought his majesty to issue writs for calling a convocation of the clergy, to be consulted in ecclesiastical matters, according to the antient usage of parliaments; and they declared they would forthwith take into considera∣tion, proper methods for giving ease to protestant dissenters. Though the king was displeased at this address, in which the lords also had concurred, he returned a civil answer, by the mouth of the earl of Nottingham, professing his regard for the church of England, which should always be his peculiar care; recommending the dissenters to their protection, and promising to summon a convocation as soon as such a measure should be convenient. This message produced no effect in favour of the bill, which lay neglected on the table. Those who moved for it had no other view than that of displaying their mo∣deration; and now they excited their friends to oppose it with all their in∣terest. Others were afraid of espousing it, lest they should be stigmatized as enemies to the church; and a great number of the most eminent presoyterians were averse to a scheme of comprehension, which would diminish their strength, and weaken the importance of the party. Being therefore violently opposed on one hand, and but faintly supported on the other, no wonder it miscarried. The king, however, was so bent upon the execution of his design, that it was next session revived in another form, though with no better success.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The next object that engrossed the attention of the parliament, was the settlement of a reveneu for the support of the government. Hitherto there had been no distinction of what was allotted for the king's use, and what was assigned for the service of the public; so that the sovereign was intirely master of the whole supply. As the revenue in the late reigns had been often embezzled and misapplied, it was now resolved that a certain sum should be set apart for the maintenance of the king's houshold, and the support of his dignity; and that the rest of the public money should be employed under the inspection of parliament. Accordingly, since this period, the commons have appropriated the yearly supplies to certain specified services; and an account of the application has been constantly submitted to both houses at the next session. At this juncture, the prevailing party, or the Whigs, determined that the revenue should be granted from year to year, or at least for a small term of years, that the king might find himself dependent upon the parliament, and merit a re∣newal of the grant by a just and popular administration. In pursuance of this maxim, when the revenue fell under consideration, they, on pretence of charges and anticipations, which they had not time to examine, granted it by a provisional act for one year only. The civil list was settled at six hundred thousand pounds, chargeable with the appointments of the queen dowager, the prince and princess of Denmark, the judges, and marechal Schomberg, to whom the parliament had already granted one hundred thousand pounds, in consideration of his important services to the nation. The commons also voted, that a constant revenue of twelve hundred thousand pounds, should be established for the support of the crown in time of peace.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The king took umbrage at these restraints laid upon the application of the public money, which were the most salutary fruits of the revolution. He considered them as marks of diffidence, by which he was distinguished
<PB N="11" REF="140"/>
from his predecessors; and thought them an ungrateful return for the services he had done the nation. The Tories perceived his disgust, and did not fail to foment his jealousy against their adversaries, which was confirmed by a fresh effort of the Whigs, in relation to a militia. A bill was brought into the house, for regulating it in such a manner as would have rendered it in a great measure independent both of the king and the lords lieutenants of counties. These being generally peers, suffered the bill to lie neglected on the table; but the attempt confirmed the suspicion of the king, who began to think him∣self in danger of being enslaved by a republican party. The Tories had, by the canal of Nottingham, made proffers of service to his majesty; but com∣plained, at the same time, that as they were in danger of being prosecuted for their lives and fortunes, they could not, without an act of indemnity, exert themselves in favour of the crown, lest they should incur a persecution from their implacable enemies.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>These remonstrances made such impression on the king, that he sent a message to the house by Mr. Hambden, recommending a bill of indemnity as the most effectual means for putting an end to all controversies, distinctions, and occasions of discord. He desired it might be prepared with all convenient expedition, and with such exceptions only as should seem necessary for the vin∣dication of public justice, the safety of him and his consort, and the settlement and welfare of the nation. An address of thanks to his majesty was unanimously voted. Nevertheless, his design was frustrated by the backwardness of the Whigs, who proceeded so slowly in the bill, that it could not be brought to maturity before the end of the session. They wanted to keep the scourge over the heads of their enemies, until they should find a proper opportunity for re∣venge; and, in the mean time, restrain them from opposition, by the terror of impending vengeance. They affected to insinuate that the king's design was to raise the prerogative as high as it had been in the preceding reigns; and for that purpose he pressed an act of indemnity, by virtue of which he might legally use the instruments of the late tyranny. The earls of Mon∣mouth and Warrington industriously infused these jealousies into the minds of their party; while, on the other hand, the earl of Nottingham inflamed Wil∣liam's distrust of his old friends; and both sides succeeded in kindling an ani∣mosity, which had like to have produced confusion, notwithstanding the en∣deavours used by the earls of Shrewsbury and Devonshire to allay those heats, and remove the suspicion that mutually prevailed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>It was now judged expedient to pass an act for settling the suc∣cession of the crown, according to the former resolution of the convention. A bill for this purpose was brought into the lower house, with a clause dis∣abling papists from succeeding to the crown: to this the lords added, "Or such as should marry papists," absolving the subject in that case from allegiance. The bishop of Salisbury, by the king's direction, proposed that the princess Sophia dutchess of Hanover, and her posterity, should be nominated in the act of succession, as the next protestant heirs, failing issue of the king, and Anne princess of Denmark. These amendments gave rise to warm debates in the lower house, where they were vigorously opposed, not only by those who wished well in secret to the late king and the lineal succession, but likewise by the republican party, who hoped to see monarchy altogether extinguished in
<PB N="12" REF="150"/>
England, by the death of the three persons already named in the bill of suc∣cession. The lords insisted upon their amendments, and several fruitless con∣ferences were held between the two houses. At length the bill was dropped for the present, in consequence of an event which in a great measure dissipated the fears of a popish successor. This was the delivery of the princess Anne, who, on the twenty-seventh day of July, brought forth a son, christened by the name of William, and afterwards created duke of Gloucester.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>In the midst of these domestic disputes, William did not neglect the affairs of the continent. He retained all his former influence in Holland, as his countrymen had reason to confide in his repeated assurances of inviolable affection. The great scheme which he had projected of a confederacy against French, began at this period to take effect. The princes of the empire as∣sembled in the diet, solemnly exhorted the emperor to declare war against the French king, who had committed numberless infractions of the treaties of Munster<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Osnabrug, Nimeguen, and the truce, invaded their country without provocation, and evinced himself an inveterate enemy of the holy Roman empire. They therefore besought his imperial majesty to conclude a treaty of peace with the Turks, who had offered advantageous terms, and come to an open rupture with Lewis; in which case, they would consider it as a war of the empire, and support their head in the most effectual manner. The states-general published a declaration against the common enemy, taxing him with manifold infractions of the treaty of commerce; with having involved the subjects of the republic in the persecution which he had raised against the pro∣testants; with having cajoled and insulted them with deceitful promises and insolent threats; with having plundered and oppressed the Dutch merchants and traders in France; and finally, with having declared war against the states, without any plausible reason assigned. The elector of Brandenburg denounced war against France, as a power whose perfidy, cruelty, and ambition, it was the duty of every prince to oppose. The marquis de Castanaga, governor of the Spanish Netherlands, issued a counter declaration to that of Lewis, who had declared against his master. He accused the French king of having laid waste the empire, without any regard to the obligations of religion and hu∣manity, or even to the laws of war; of having countenanced the most bar∣barous acts of cruelty and oppression; and of having intrigued with the ene∣mies of Christ for the destruction of the empire. The emperor negotiated an alliance offensive and defensive, with the states-general, binding the contrac∣ting parties to co-operate with their whole power against France and her allies. It was stipulated, that neither side should engage in a separate treaty, on any pretence whatsoever: that no peace should be admitted, until the treaties of Westphalia, Osnabrug, Munster, and the Pyrenees, should have been vindi∣cated: that in case of a negotiation for a peace or truce, the transactions on both sides should be communicated bona side; and that Spain and England should be invited to accede to the treaty. In a separate article, the contracting powers agreed, that in case of the Spanish king's dying without issue, the states-general should assist the emperor with all their forces to take possession of that monarchy: That they should use their friendly endeavours with the princes electors their allies, towards elevating his son Joseph to the dignity of king of
<PB N="13" REF="160"/>
the Romans; and employ their utmost force against France, should she at∣tempt to oppose his elevation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>William, who was the soul of this confederacy, found no difficulty in persuading the English to undertake a war against their old enemies and rivals. On the sixteenth day of April, Mr. Hambden made a motion for taking into consideration the state of the kingdom with respect to France, and foreign alliances; and the commons unanimously resolved, that in case his majesty should think fit to engage in a war with France, they would, in a parliamentary way, enable him to carry it on with vigour. An address was immediately drawn up, and presented to the king, desiring he would seriously consider the destructive methods taken of late years by the French king, against the trade, quiet, and interest of the nation, particularly his present invasion of Ireland, and supporting the rebels in that kingdom. They did not doubt but the alliances already made with such as might hereafter be concluded by his majesty, would be sufficient to reduce the French king to such a condition, that it should not be in his power to violate the peace of Christendom; nor prejudice the trade and prosperity of England: in the mean time they assured his majesty he might depend upon the assistance of his parliament, according to the vote which had passed in the house of commons. This was a welcome address to king William, who assured them that no part of the supplies which they might grant for the prosecution of the war, should be misapplied; and, on the seventh day of May, he declared war against the French monarch. On this occasion Lewis was charged with having ambitiously invaded the ter∣ritories of the emperor, and denounced war against the allies of England, in violation of the treaties confirmed under the guaranty of the English crown; with having encroached upon the fishery of Newfoundland, invaded the Ca∣ribbee islands, taken forcible possession of New York and Hudson's bay, made depredations on the English at sea, prohibited the importation of English ma∣nufactures, disputed the right of the flag, persecuted many English subjects on account of religion, contrary to express treaties and the law of nations; and sent an armament to Ireland, in support of the rebels in that kingdom.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Having thus described the progress of the revolution in England, we shall now briefly explain the measures that were prosecuted in Scotland, towards the establishment of William on the throne of that kingdom. The meeting of the Scottish convention was fixed for the fourteenth day of March; and both parties employed all their interest to influence the election of members. The duke of Hamilton, and all the presbyterians, declared for William. The duke of Gordon maintained the castle of Edinburgh for his old master; but, as he had neglected to lay in a store of provisions, he dep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nded entirely upon the citizens for subsistence. The partisans of James were headed by the earl of Balcarras, and Graham viscount Dundee, who employed their endeavours to preserve union among the individuals of their party; to confirm the duke of Gordon, who began to waver in his attachment to their sovereign; and to manage their intrigues in such a manner as to derive some advantage to their cause from the transactions of the ensuing session. When the lords and com∣mons assembled at Edinburgh, the bishop of that diocese, who officiated as chaplain to the convention, prayed for the restoration of king James. The first dispute turned upon the choice of a president. The friends of the late
<PB N="14" REF="170"/>
king set up the marquis of Athol in opposition to the duke of Hamilton; but this last was elected by a considerable majority; and a good number of the other party finding their cause the weakest, deserted it from that moment. The earls of Lothian and Tweedale were sent as deputies, to require the duke of Gordon, in the name of the estates, to quit the castle in four and twenty hours, and leave the charge of it to the protestant officer next in command. The duke, though in himself irresolute, was animated by Dundee to demand such conditions as the convention would not grant. The negotiation proving ineffectual, the estates ordered the heralds, in all their formalities, to summon him to surrender the castle immediately, on pain of incurring the penalties of high treason; and he refusing to obey their mandate, was proclaimed a traitor. All persons were forbid, under the same penalties, to aid, succour, or cor∣respond with him; and the castle was blocked up by the troops of the city.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Next day an express arrived from London, with a letter from king William to the states; and at the same time, another from James was presented by one Crane an English domestic of the abdicated queen. William observed that he had called a meeting of their estates, at the desire of the no∣bility and gentry of Scotland assembled at London, who requested that he would take upon himself the administration of their affairs. He exhorted them to concert measures for settling the peace of the kingdom upon a solid foundation; and to lay aside animosities and factions, which served only to impede that salutary settlement. He professed himself sensible of the good effects that would arise from an union of the two kingdoms; and assured them he would use his best endeavours to promote such a coalition. A committee being appointed to draw up a respectful answer to these assurances, a debate ensued about the letter from the late king James, which they resolved to fa∣vour with a reading, after the member, should have subscribed an act, de∣claring, that notwithstanding any thing that might be contained in the letter for dissolving the convention or impeding their procedure, they were a free and lawful meeting of the states; and would continue undissolved, until they should have settled and secured the protestant religion, the government, laws, and liberties of the kingdom. Having taken this precaution, they proceeded to exa∣mine the letter of their late sovereign, who conjured them to support his interest as faithful subjects, and eternize their names by a loyalty suitable to their former professions. He said he would not fail to give them such speedy and powerful assistance as would enable them to defend themselves from any foreign at∣tempt; and even to assert his right against those enemies who had depressed it by the blackest usurpations and unnatural attempts, which the Almighty God would not allow to pass unpunished. He offered pardon to all those who should return to their duty before the last day of the month; and threatened to punish rigorously such as should stand out in rebellion against him and his authority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>This address produced very little effect in favour of the unfor∣tunate exile, whose friends were greatly outnumbered in this assembly. His messenger was ordered into custody, and afterwards dismissed with a pass in∣stead of an answer. James foreseeing this contempt, had, by an instrument dated in Ireland, authorised the archbishop of Glasgow, the earl of Balcarras, and the viscount Dundee, to call a convention of the estates at Stirling. These
<PB N="15" REF="180"/>
three depended on the interest of the marquis of Athol and the earl of Mar, who professed the warmest affection for the late king; and they hoped a se∣cession of their friends would embarrass the convention, so as to retard the settlement of king William. Their expectations, however, were disappointed. Athol deserted their cause; Mar suffered himself to be intercepted in his re∣treat; the rest of their party were, by the vigilance of the duke of Hamilton, prevented from leaving the convention, except the viscount of Dundee, who retreated to the mountains with about fifty horse, and was pursued by order of the estates. This design being frustrated, the convention approved and re∣cognized, by a solemn act, the conduct of the nobility and gentlemen who had intreated the king of England to take upon him the administration. They acknowledged their obligation to the prince of Orange, who had pre∣vented the destruction of their laws, religion, and fundamental constitution: they besought his highness to assume the reins of government for that king∣dom: they issued a proclaration, requiring all persons, from sixteen to sixty, to be in readiness to take arms when called upon for that purpose: they con∣ferred the command of their horse-militia upon Sir Patrick Hume, who was attainted for having been concerned in Argyle's insurrection: they levied eight hundred men for a guard to the city of Edinburgh, and constituted the earl of Leven their commander: they put the militia all over the kingdom into the hands of those on whom they could rely: they created the earl of Mar governor of Stirling castle: they received a reinforcement of five regiments from England, under the command of Mackay, whom they appointed their general; and they issued orders for securing all disaffected persons. Then they dispatched lord Ross, with an answer to king William's letter, professing their gratitude to their deliverer, congratulating him upon his success, thanking him for assuming the administration of their affairs, and assembling a conven∣tion of their estates, declaring they would take effectual and speedy measures for securing the protestant religion, as well as for establishing the government, laws, and liberties of the kingdom; assuring him they would, as much as lay in their power, avoid disputes and animosities; and desiring the con∣tinuance of his majesty's care and protection.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>After the departure of lord Ross, they appointed a committee, con∣sisting of eight lords, eight knights, and as many burgesses, to prepare the plan of a new settlement: but this resolution was not taken without a vigorous opposition from some remaining adherents of the late king, headed by the arch∣bishop of Glasgow, all the other prelates, except he of Edinburgh, having already deserted the convention. After warm debates, the committee agreed in the following vote. "The estates of the kingdom of Scotland find and de∣clare, That king James VII. being a professed papist, did assume the royal power, and act as a king, without ever taking the oath required by law; and had, by the advice of evil and wicked counsellors, invaded the fundamental constitution of this kingdom, and altered it from a legal and limited mo∣narchy, to an arbitrary despotic power; and had governed the same to the subversion of the protestant religion, and violation of the laws and liberties of the nation, inverting all the ends of government; whereby he had forfaulted the right of the crown, and the throne was become vacant." When this vote was reported, the bishop of Edinburgh argued strenuously against it, as containing
<PB N="16" REF="190"/>
a charge of which the king was innocent; and he proposed that his majesty should be invited to return to his Scottish dominions. All his argu∣ments were defeat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d or over-ruled; the house confirmed the vote, which was immediately enacted into a law by a great majority. The lord president de∣clared the throne <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acant, and proposed that it might be filled with William and Mary, king and queen of England. The committee was ordered to pre∣pare an act for settling the crown upon their majesties, together with an in∣strument of governm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt for securing the subjects from the grievan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s under which they laboured.</P>

<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>On the eleventh day of April, this act, with the conditions of in∣heritance, and the instrument, were reported, considered, unanimously ap∣proved, and solemnly p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oclaimed at the market-cross of Edinburgh, in pre∣sence of the lord pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sident, ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted by the lord provost and magistracy of the city, the duke of Queensberry, the marquiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Ath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l and Douglas, to∣gether with a great number of the nobility and gentry. At the same time they publ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed another proclamation, forbidding all persons to acknowledge, obey, assist, or correspond, with the late king James; or by word, writing, or ser∣mon, to dispute or disown the royal authority of king William and queen Mary<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or to misconstrue the proceedings of the estates, or create jealousies or misapprehensions with regard to the transactions of the government, on pain of incurring the most severe penalties. Then, having settled the coronation-oath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they granted a commission to the earl of Argyle for the lords, Sir James Mont∣gomery for the knights, and Sir John Dalrymple for the boroughs, impower∣ing them to repair to London, and invest their majesties with the govern∣ment. This affair being discussed, the convention appointed a committee to take care of the public peace, and adjourned to the twenty-first day of May. On the eleventh day of that month, the Scottish commissioners being introduced to their majesties at Whitehall, presented first a preparatory letter from the estates, then the instrument of government, with a paper containing a recital of the grievances of the nation; and an address, desiring his majesty to con∣vert the convention into a parliament. The king having graciously promised to concur with them in all just measures for the interest of the kingdom, the coronation-oath was tendered to their majesties by the earl of Argyle. As it contained a clause, importing, that they should root out heresy, the king declared, that he did not mean by these words, that he should be under an obligation to act as a persecutor: the commissioners replying, that such was not the meaning or import of the oath, he desired them, and others present, to bear witness to the exception he had made.</P>

<DIV4 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time, lord Dundee exerted himself with uncommon activity in behalf of his master. He had been summoned by a trumpet to re∣turn to the convention; but refused to obey the citation, on pretence tha the Whigs had made an attempt upon his life; and that the deliberations of the estates were influenced by the neighbourhood of English troops, under the command of Mackay. He was forthwith declared a fugitive, outlaw, and rebel. He was rancorously hated by the prebyterians, on whom he had ex∣ercised some cruelties, as an officer under the former government; and for this reason the states resolved to inflict upon him exemplary punishment. Parties were detached in pursuit of him and Balcarras. This last fell into their
<PB N="17" REF="200"/>
hands, and was committed to a common prison; but Dundee fought his way through the troops that surrounded him, and escaped to the Highlands, where he determined to take arms in favour of James, though that prince had forbid him to make any attempt of that nature, until he should receive a reinforce∣ment from Ireland. While this officer was employed in assembling the clans of his party, king William appointed the duke of Hamilton commissioner to the convention parliament. The post of secretary for Scotland was bestowed upon lord Melvil, a weak and servile nobleman, who had taken refuge in Holland from the violences of the late reigns; but the king depended chiefly for advice upon Dalrymple lord Stair, president of the college of justice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an old crafty fanatic, who for fifty years had complied in all things with all go∣vernments. Though these were rigid presbyterians, the king, to humour the opposite party, admitted some individuals of the episcopal nobility to the council-board; and this intermixture, instead of allaying animosities, served only to sow the seeds of discord and confusion. The Scottish convention, in their detail of grievances, enumerated the lords of the articles; the act of parliament in the reign of Charles II. by which the king's supremacy was raised so high that he could prescribe any mode of religion according to his pleasure; and the superiority of any office in the church, above that of presby∣ters. The king, in his instructions to the lord commissioner, consented to a regulation of the lords of the articles, though he would not allow the institu∣tion to be abrogated: he was contented that the act relating to the king's su∣premacy should be rescinded; and that the church-government should be established in such a manner as would be most agreeable to the inclinations of the people.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>On the seventeenth day of June, duke Hamilton opened the Scottish parliament, after the convention had assumed this name, in conse∣quence of an act passed by his majesty's direction: but the members in ge∣neral were extremely chagrined when they found the commissioners so much restricted in the affair of the lords of the articles, which they considered as their chief grievance <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The lords of the articles, by the gradual <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surpation of the crown, actually constituted a griev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce intolerable in a free nation. The king impowered the commissioner to chuse eight bi∣shops, whom he a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thorised to nominate eight noblemen: these together chose eight barons, and eight burgesses; and this whole number, in co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>junction with the officers of state as supernu∣meraries, constituted the lords of the articles. This committee possessed the sole excl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sive right and liberty of bringing in motions, making overtures for redressing wrongs, and proposing means and expedients for the relief, safety, and benefit of the subjects. Proceedings of the Scots parliament vindicated.</NOTE>. The king permitted that the estates should chuse the lords by their own suffrages; and that they should be at liberty to reconsider any subject which the said lords might reject. He afterwards indulged the three estates with the choice of eleven delegates each, for this committee, to be elected monthly, or oftener, if they should think fit; but even these con∣ces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ions proved unsatisfactory, while the institution itself remained. Their discontents were not even appeased by the passing of an act, abolishing prelacy. Indeed their resentment was inflamed by another consideration; namely, that of the king's having given seats in the council to some individuals attached to the hierarchy. They manifested their sentiments on this subject by bringing in a bill, excluding from any public trust, place, or employment, under their majesties,

all such as had been concerned in the encroachments of the late reign, or had discovered disaffection to the late happy change; or in any way re∣tarded or obstructed the designs of the convention. This measure was pro∣secuted with great warmth; and the bill passed through all the forms of the house, but proved ineffectual for want of the royal assent.</P>

<DIV4 N="24" TYPE="section">

<P>Nor were they less obstinate in the affair of the judges, whom the king had ventured to appoint by virtue of his own prerogative. The male∣contents brought in a bill, declaring the bench vacant as it was at the restora∣tion; asserting their own right to examine and approve those who should be ap¦pointed to fill it: providing, that if in time to come, any such total vacancy should occur, the nomination should be in the king, or queen, or regent for the time being, and the parliament retain the right of approbation; and that all the clauses in the several acts relating to the admission of the ordinary lords of ses∣sion, and their qualifications for that office should be ratified and confirmed for perpetual observation. Such was the interest of this party, that the bill was carried by a great majority, notwithstanding the opposition of the ministers, who resolved to maintain the king's nomination even in defiance of a parlia∣mentary resolution. The majority, exasperated at this open violation of their privileges, forbad the judges whom the king had appointed, to open their com∣missions, or hold a session until his majesty's further pleasure should be known: on the other hand, they were compelled to act by the menaces of the privy∣council. The dispute was carried on with great acrimony on both sides, and produced such a ferment, that before the session opened, the ministry thought proper to draw a great number of forces into the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, to support the judges in the exercise of their functions.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The lord-commissioner, alarmed at this scene of tumult and confu∣sion, adjourned the house till the eighth day of October; a step, which added to the other unpopular measures of the court, incensed the opposition to such a degree, that they drew up a remonstrance to the king, complaining of this ad∣journment while the nation was yet unsettled, recapitulating the several in∣stances in which they had expressed their zeal and affection for his majesty; explaining their reasons for dissenting from the ministry in some articles; beseech∣ing him to consider what they had represented; to give his royal assent to the acts of parliament which they had prepared, and take measures for redressing all the other grievances of the nation. This address was presented to the king at Hampton-court, and he was so touched with the reproaches it implied, as if he had not fulfilled the conditions on which he accepted the crown of Scotland, that he, in his own vindication, published his instructions to the commissioner; and by these it appeared, that the duke might have proceeded to greater lengths in obliging his countrymen. Before the adjournment, however, the parliament had granted the revenue for life; and raised money for maintaining a body of forces, as well as for supporting the incidental expence of the government for some months: yet part of the troops in that kingdom were supplied and sub∣sisted by the administration of England. In consequence of these disputes in the Scottish parliament, their church was left without any settled form of govern∣ment; for, though the hierarchy was abolished, the presbyterian discipline was not yet established, and ecclesiastical affairs were occasionally regulated by the
<PB N="19" REF="220"/>
privy-council, deriving its authority from that very act of supremacy, which, according to the claim of rights, ought to have been repealed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The session was no sooner adjourned, than Sir John Lanier con∣verted the blockade of Edinburgh-castle into a regular siege, which was prose∣cuted with such vigour, that in a little time the fortifications were ruined, and the works advanced to the foot of the walls, in which the besiegers had made several large breaches. The duke of Gordon finding his ammunition expended, his defences destroyed, his intelligence intirely cut off, and despairing of relief from the adherents of his master, desired to capitulate, and obtained very fa∣vourable terms for his garrison; but, he would not stipulate any conditions for himself, declaring, that he had so much respect for all the princes descended from king James VI. that he would not affront any of them so far as to insist upon terms for his own particular; he therefore, on the thirteenth day of June, sur∣rendered the castle and himself at discretion. All the hopes of James and his party were now concentred in the viscount of Dundee, who had assembled a body of Highlanders, and resolved to attack Mackay, on an assurance he had re∣ceived by message, that the regiment of Scottish dragoons would desert that officer, and join him in the action. Mackay having received intimation of this design, decamped immediately, and by long marches retired before Dundee, until he was reinforced by Ramsey's dragoons, and another regiment of Eng∣lish infantry; then he faced about, and Dundee in his turn retreated into Lochaber. Lord Murray, son of the marquis of Athole, assembled his vassals to the number of twelve hundred men for the service of the regency; but, he was betrayed by one of his own dependants, who seized the castle of Blair for Dundee, and prevailed upon the Athol men to disperse rather than fight against James their lawful sovereign.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The viscount was by this time reduced to great difficulty and distress. His men had not for many weeks tasted bread or salt, or any drink but water: Instead of five hundred infantry, three hundred horse, with a supply of arms, ammunition, and provision, which James had promised to send from Ireland, he received a reinforcement of three hundred naked recruits; but, the transports with the stores fell into the hands of the English. Though this was a mortifying disappointment, he bore it without repining; and, far from aban∣doning himself to despair, began his march to the castle of Blair, which was threatened with a siege by general Mackay. When he reached this fortress, he received intelligence that the enemy had entered the pass of Killycrankie, and resolved to give them battle without delay. He accordingly advanced against them; and a furious engagement ensued, though it was not of long duration. The Highlanders having received and returned the fire of the English, fell in among them sword in hand with such impetuosity, that the foot were utterly broke in seven minutes. The dragoons fled at the first charge in the utmost consternation: Dundee's horse, not exceeding one hundred, broke through Mackay's own regiment: the earl of Dumbarton, at the head of a few volun∣teers made himself master of the artillery: twelve hundred of Mackay's forces were killed on the spot, five hundred taken prisoners, and the rest fled with great precipitation for some hours, until they were rallied by their general, who was an officer of approved courage, conduct, and experience. Nothing could be more complete or decisive than the victory which the Highlanders obtained;
<PB N="20" REF="230"/>
yet it was dearly purchased with the death of their beloved chieftain the viscount of Dundee, who fell by a random-shot in the engagement, and his fate pro∣duced such confusion in his army as prevented all pursuit. He possessed an en∣terprising spirit, undaunted courage, inviolable fidelity, and was peculiarly qualified to command the people who fought under his banner. He was the life and soul of that cause which he espoused; and after his death it daily de∣clined into ruin and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sgrace. He was succeeded in command by colonel Can∣non, who landed the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nforcement from Ireland; but, all his designs miscar∣ried: so that the clans, wearied with repeated misfortunes, laid down their arms by degrees, and took the benefit of a pardon, which king William offered to those who should submit within the time specified in his proclamation.</P>

<P>After this sketch of Scottish affairs, it will be necessary to take a retrospective view of James, and relate the parti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulars of his expedition to Ire∣land. That unfortunate prince and his queen were received with the most cor∣dial hosputality by the French monarch, who assigned the castle of St. Germain for the place of their residence, supported their houshold with great magnificence, enriched them with presents, and undertook to re-establish them on the throne of England. James, however, conducted himself in such a manner as conveyed no favourable idea of his spirit and understanding. He seemed to have been emasculated by religion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was deserted by that courage and magnanimity for which his youth had been distinguished. He did not discover great sensibility at the loss of his kingdom. All his faculties were swallowed up in bigotry. Instead of contriving plans for retrieving his crown, he held conferences with the jesuits on topics of religion. The pity which his misfortunes excited in Lewis was mingled with contempt. The pope supplied him with indulgences, while the Romans laughed at him in pasquinades; <Q>“There is a pious man, said the archbishop of Rheims, (ironically) who has sacrificed three crowns for a mass.”</Q> In a word, he subjected himself to the ridicule and raillery of the French nation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>All the hope of reascending the British throne depended upon his friends in Scotland and Ireland. Tyrconnel, who commanded in this last king∣dom was confirmed in his attachment to James, by the persuasions of Hamilton, who had undertaken for his submission to the prince of Orange. Nevertheless, he disguised his sentiments, and temporized with William, until James should be able to supply him with reinforcements from France, which he earnestly so∣licited by private messages. In the mean time, with a view to cajole the protes∣tants of Ireland, and amuse king William with hope of his submission, he per∣suaded the lord Mountjoy, in whom the protestants chiefly confided, and baron Rice, to go in person with a commission to James, representing the necessity of yielding to the times; and of waiting a fitter opportunity to make use of his Irish subjects. Mountjoy, on his arrival at Paris, instead of being favoured with an au∣dience by James, to explain the reasons which Tyrconnel had suggested touching the inability of Ireland to restore his majesty, was committed prisoner to the Bastile, on account of the zeal with which he had espoused the protestant interest. Al∣though Lewis was sincerely disposed to assist James effectually, his intentions were obstructed by the disputes of his ministry. Louvois possessed the chief credit in council; but, Seignelai enjoyed a greater share of personal favour, both with the king and madam de Maintenon. To this nobleman, as secretary for ma∣rine
<PB N="21" REF="240"/>
affairs, James made his chief application; and he had promised the com∣mand of the troops destined for his service, to Lausun, whom Louvois hated. For these reasons this minister thwarted his measures, and retarded the assistance which Lewis had promised towards his restoration.</P>

<P>Yet, notwithstanding all his opposition, the succours were prepared, and the fleet ready to put to sea by the latter end of February. The French king is said to have offered an army of fifteen thousand natives of France to serve in this expedition; but, James replied, that he would succeed by the help of his own subjects, or perish in the attempt. Accordingly he contented himself with about twelve hundred British subjects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James in this expedition was attended by the duke of Berwick and Mr. Fitzjames grand prior, the duke of Powis, the earls of Dover, Melfort, Abercorn, and Seaforth; the lords Henry and Tho∣mas Howard, the lords Drummond, Dungan, Trendraught, Ruchan, Hunsdon, and Brittas; the bishops of Chester and Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way, the late lord∣chief-justice H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbert; the marquis D'Estrades, Mr. de Rozen marechal de camp; Mamoo, Pu∣signan, and Lori lieutenant-generals, Prontee engineer general; the marquis de Alb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ville, Sir John Sparrow, Sir Roger Strickland, Sir William Jennings, Sir Henry Bond, Sir Charles Carney, Sir Edward Vaudrey, Sir Charles Murray, Sir Robert Parker, Sir Alphonso Maiolo, Sir Samu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l Foxo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Sir William Wallis; the colonels P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ter, Sars<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield, Anthony and John Hamilton, Simon and Henry Lutterel, Ramsay, Dorrington, Suther∣land, Clifford, Parker, Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cel, Cannon, and Field∣ing, with about two and twenty other officers of inferior rank.</NOTE> and a good number of French officers, who were embarked in the fleet at Brest, consisting of fourteen ships of the line, seven frigates, three fireships, with a good number of transports. The French king also supplied him with a considerable quantity of arms for the use of his adherents in Ireland; accommodated him with a large sum of mo∣ney, super<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> equipages, store of plate, and necessaries of all kinds for the camp and the houshold. At parting, he presented him with his own cuirass, and embracing him affectionately, <Q>“The best thing I can wish you (said he) is that I may never see you again.”</Q> On the seventh day of March James embarked at Brest, together with the count D'Avaux, who accompanied him in quality of ambassador, and his principal officers. He was detained in the harbour by con∣trary winds till the seventeenth day of the month, when he set sail, and on the twenty-second landed at Kinsale in Ireland. By this time, king William per∣ceiving himself amused by Tyrconnel, had published a declaration, requiring the Irish to lay down their arms, and submit to the new government. On the twenty-second day of February thirty ships of war had been put in commission, and the command of them confered upon admiral Herbert; but, the arma∣ment was retarded in such a manner by the disputes of the council, and the king's attention to the affairs of the continent, that the admiral was not in a condition to sail till the beginning of April, and then with part of his fleet only. James was received with open arms at Kinsale, and the whole country seemed to be at his devotion; for, although the protestants in the North had declared for the new government, their strength and number was deemed incon∣siderable when compared with the power of Tyrconnel, who had disarmed all the other protestant subjects in one day, and assembled an army of thirty thou∣sand foot, and eight thousand cavalry for the service of his master.</P>

<P>In the latter end of March, James made his public entry into Dublin, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. He was met at the castle∣gate by a procession of popish bishops and priests in their pontificals, bearing the
<PB N="22" REF="250"/>
host, which he publicly adored. He dismissed from the council-board, the lord Granard, judge Keating, and other protestants, who had exhorted the lord-lieutenant to an accommodation with the new government. In their room he admitted the French ambassador, the bishop of Chester, colonel Dorrington, and by degrees, the principal noblemen who accompanied him in the expedition. On the second day after his arrival in Dublin, he issued five proclamations: the first recalling all the subjects of Ireland who had abandoned the kingdom, by a certain time, on pain of outlawry and confiscation; and re∣quiring all persons to join him against the prince of Orange. The second contained expressions of acknowledgment to his catholic subjects for their vigilance and fidelity; and an injunction to such as were not actually in his ser∣vice, to retain and lay up their arms until it should be found necessary to use them for his advantage. By the third he invited the subjects to supply his army with provisions; and prohibited the soldiers to take any thing without payment. By the fourth he raised the value of the current coin. And in the fifth he sum∣moned a parliament, to meet on the seventh day of May at Dublin. Finally, he created Tyrconnel a duke, in consideration of his eminent services.</P>

<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>The adherents of James in England pressed him to settle the affairs of Ireland immediately, and bring over his army either to the north of England, or the west of Scotland, where it might be joined by his party, and act without delay against the usurper; but, his council dissuaded him from com∣plying with their solicitations, until Ireland should be totally reduced to obedi∣ence. On the first alarm of an intended massacre, the protestants of London∣derry had shut their gates against the regiment commanded by the earl of An∣trim; and resolved to defend themselves against the lord-lieutenant. They transmitted this resolution to the government of England, together with an ac∣count of the danger they incurred by such a vigorous measure; and implored immediate assistance. They were accor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingly supplied with some arms and ammunition; but, did not receive any considerable reinforcement till the middle of April, when two regiments arrived in Loughfoyl, under the com∣mand of Cunningham and Richards. By this time king James had taken Cole∣raine, invested Killmore, and was almost in sight of Londonderry. George Walker, rector of Donaghmore, who had raised a regiment for the defence of the protestants, conveyed this intelligence to Lundy the governor. This officer directed him to join colonel Crafton, and take post at the Long-causey, which he maintained a whole night against the advanced guard of the enemy, until being overpowered by numbers, he retreated to Londonderry, and exhorted the gover∣nor to take the field, as the army of king James was not yet completely formed. Lundy assembling a council of war, at which Cunningham and Richards assisted, they agreed, that as the place was not tenable, it would be imprudent to land the two regiments; and that the principal officers should withdraw themselves from Londonderry, the inhabitants of which would obtain the more favourable capitulation in consequence of their retreat. An officer was imme∣diately dispatched to king James, with proposals of a negotiation; and lieute∣nant-general Hamilton agreed, that the army should halt at the distance of four miles from the town. Notwithstanding this preliminary, James advanced at the head of his troops; but met with such a warm reception from the besieged, that he was fain to retire to St. John's town in some disorder. The inhabitants
<PB N="23" REF="260"/>
and soldiers in garrison at Londonderry were so incensed at the members of the council of war, who had resolved to abandon the place, that they threatened immediate vengeance. Cunningham and Richards retired to their ships; and Lundy locked himself in his chamber. In vain did Walker and major Baker exhort him to maintain his government. Such was his cowardice or treachery, that he absolutely refused to be concerned in the defence of the place; and he was suffered to escape in disguise, with a load of match upon his back: but, he was afterwards apprehended in Scotland, from whence he was sent to London, to answer for his persidy or misconduct.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>After his retreat, the townsmen chose Mr. Walker and major Baker for their governors, with joint-authority; but, this office they would not undertake, until it had been offered to colonel Cunningham as the officer next in command to Lundy. He rejected the proposal, and with Richards returned to England, where they were immediately cashiered. The two new governors, thus abandoned to their fate, began to prepare for a vigorous defence; and in∣deed their courage seems to have transcended the bounds of discretion; for, the place was very ill fortified: their cannon, which did not exceed twenty pieces, were wretchedly mounted; they had not one engineer to direct their operations; they had a very small number of horse; the garrison consisted of people un∣acquainted with military discipline; they were destitute of provisions; they were besieged by a king in person, at the head of a formidable army, directed by good officers, and supplied with all the necessary implements for a srege or battle. This town was invested on the twentieth day of April; the batteries were soon opened; and several attacks were made with great impetuosity: but, the be∣siegers were always repulsed with considerable loss. The townsmen gained divers advantages in repeated sallies; and would have held their enemies in the utmost contempt, had not they been afflicted with a contagious distemper, and reduced to extremity by want of provision. They were even tantalized in their distress; for, they had the mortification to see some ships which had arrived with supplies from England, prevented from sailing up the river by the batte∣ries the enemy had raised on both sides, and a boom with which they had blocked up the channel. At length, a reinforcement arrived in the Lough, under the command of general Kirke, who had deserted his master and been employed in the service of king William. He found means to convey intelli∣gence to Walker, that he had troops and provisions on board for their relief; but, found it impracticable to sail up the river: he promised, however, that he would land a body of forces at the Inch, and endeavour to make a diversion in their favour, when joined by the troops at Inniskillen, which amounted to five thousand men, including two thousand cavalry. He said he expected six thou∣sand men from England, where they were embarked before he set sail<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He exhorted them to persevere in their courage and loyalty, and assured them he would come to their relief at all hazards. These assurances enabled them to bear their miseries a little longer, though their numbers daily diminished; and major Baker dying, his place was filled with colonel Michelburn, who now acted as collegue to Mr. Walker.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>King James having returned to Dublin to be present at the par∣liament, the command of his army devolved to the French general Rosene, who was exasperated at such an obstinate opposition by a handful of halfstarved
<PB N="24" REF="270"/>
militia. He threatened to raze the town to its foundations, and destroy the inhabitants, without distinction of age or sex, unle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they would immedi∣ately submit themselves to their lawful sovereign. The governors treated his menaces with contempt; and published an order, that no person, on pain of death, should talk of surrendering. They had now consumed the last remains of their provision, and supported life by eating the flesh of horses, dogs, cats, rats, mice, tallow, starch, and salted hides; and even this loathsome food began to fail. Rosene finding them deaf to all his proposals, threatened to wreak his vengeance on all the protestants of that country, and drive them under the walls of Londonderry, where they should be suffered to perish by famine. The bishop of Meath being informed of this design, complained to king James of the barbarous intention, intreating his majesty to prevent its being put in exe∣cution. That prince assured him that he had already ordered Rosene to desist from such proceedings. Nevertheless, he executed his threats with the utmost ri∣gour. Parties of dragoons were detached on this cruel service, and after having stripped all the protestants for thirty miles round, they drove these unhappy peo∣ple before them like cattle; without even sparing the enfeebled old men, nurses with infants at their breasts, tender children, women just delivered, and some even in the pangs of labour. Above four thousand of these miserable objects were driven under the walls of Londonderry. This expedient, far from answer∣ing the purpose of Rosene, produced a quite contrary effect. The besieged were so exasperated at this act of inhumanity, that they resolved to perish rather than submit to such a barbarian. They erected a gibbet in sight of the enemy, and sent a message to the French general importing, That they would hang all the prisoners they had taken during the siege, unless the protestants whom they had driven under the walls, should be immediately dismissed. This threat pro∣duced a negotiation, in consequence of which the protestants were released, after they had been detained three days without tasting food. Some hundreds died of famine or satigue; and those who lived to re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn to their own habita∣tions, found them plundered and sacked by the papists; so that the greater num∣ber perished for want, or were murdered by the straggling parties of the enemy: yet, those very people had for the most part obtained protections from king James, to which no respect was payed by his general.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The garrison of Londonderry was now reduced from seven to five thousand seven hundred men; and these were driven to such extremity of distress, that they began to talk of killing the popish inhabitants, and feed∣ing on their bodies. In this emergency, Kirke, who had hitherto lain inactive, ordered two ships laden with provision to sail up the river, under convoy of the Dartmouth frigate. One of these, called the Mountjoy, broke the enemy's boom; and all the three, after having sustained a very hot fire from both sides of the river, arrived in safety at the town, to the inexpressible joy of the inha∣bitants. The army of James were so dispirited by the success of this enter∣prize, that they abandoned the siege in the night; and retired with precipitation, after having l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st about nine thousand men before the place. Kirke no sooner took possession of the town, than Walker was prevailed upon to embark for England, with an address of thanks from the inhabitants to their majesties, for the seasonable r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ef they had received.</P>

<P>The Inniskilliners were no less remarkable than the people of Londonderry for the valour and perseverance with which they opposed the pa∣pists. They raised twelve companies, which they regimented under the com∣mand of Gustavus Hamilton, whom they chose for their governor. They pro∣claimed William and Mary on the eleventh day of March; and resolved in a general council to maintain their title against all opposition. The lord Gilmoy invested the castle of Crom belonging to the protestants in the neighbourhood of Inniskillin, the inhabitants of which threw succours into the place, and com∣pelled Gilmoy to retire to Belturbet. A detach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent of the garrison, com∣manded by lieutenant-colonel Lloyd, took and demolished the castle of Aughor; and they gained the advantage in several skirmishes with the enemy. On the day that preceded the relief of Londonderry, they defeated six thousand Irish pa∣pists at a place called Newton-Butler, and took their commander Maccarty, commonly called lord Moncashel.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Irish parliament being assembled at Dublin, according to the proclamation of king James, he, in a speech from the throne, thanked them for the zeal, courage, and loyalty they had manifested; extolled the generosity of the French king, who had enabled him to visit them in person; insisted upon executing his design of establishing liberty of conscience, as a step equally agreeable to the dictates of humanity and discretion; and promised to concur with them in enacting such laws as would contribute to the peace, afflu∣ence, and security of his subjects. Sir Richard Neagle being chosen speaker of the commons, moved for an address of thanks to his majesty; and that the count D'Avaux should be desired to make their acknowledgments to the most christian king, for the generous assistance he had given to their sovereign. These addresses being drawn up, with the concurrence of both houses, a bill was brought in to recognize the king's title, to express their abhorrence of the usur∣pation by the prince of Orange, as well as of the defection of the English. Next day James published a declaration, complaining of the calumnies which his enemies had spread to his prejudice; expatiating upon his own impartiality in preferring his protestant subjects; his care in protecting them from their enemies, in redressing their grievances, and in granting liberty of conscience; promising that he would take no step but with the approbation of parliament; offering a free pardon to all persons who should desert his enemies, and join with him in four and twenty days after his landing in Ireland; and charging all the blood that might be shed, upon those who should continue in rebel∣lion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>His conduct, however, very ill agreed with this declaration; nor can it be excused on any other supposition but that of his being governed in some cases against his own inclination, by the count D'Avaux, and the Irish catholics, on whom his whole dependance was placed. As both houses were chiefly filled with members of that persuasion, we ought not to wonder at their bringing in a bill for repealing the act of settlement, by which the protestants of the kingdom had been secured in the possession of their estates. These were by this law divested of their lands, which reverted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the heirs of those catholics to whom they belonged before the rebellion. This iniquitous bill was framed in such a manner, that no regard was payed to such protestant owners as had purchased estates for valuable considerations: no allowance was
<PB N="26" REF="290"/>
made for improvements, nor any provision for protestant widows: the possessor and tenants were not even allowed to remove their stock and corn. When the bill was sent up to the lords, Dr. Dopping bishop of Meath opposed it with equal courage and ability; and an address in behalf of the purchasers under the act of settlement, was presented to the king by the earl of Granard: but, notwith∣standing these remonstrances, it received the royal assent; and the protestants of Ireland were mostly ruined.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Yet, in order to complete their destruction, an act of attainder was passed against all protestants whether male or female, whether of high or low degree, who were absent from the kingdom, as well as against all those who retired into any part of the three kingdoms, which did not own the autho∣rity of king James, or corresponded with rebels, or were any ways aiding, abetting, or assisting to them from the first day of August in the preceding year. The number of protestants attainted by name in this act, amounted to about three thousand, including two archbishops, one duke, seventeen earls, seven countesses, as many bishops, eighteen barons, three and thirty baronets, one and fifty knights, eighty-three clergymen, who were declared traitors, and ad∣judged to suffer the pains of death and forfeiture. The individuals subjected to this dreadful proscription, were even cut off from all hope of pardon, and all benefit of appeal: for, by a clause in the act, the king's pardon was de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med null, unless enrolled before the first day of December; and a subsequent law was enacted, declaring Ireland independent of the English parliament. This assembly passed another act, granting twenty thousand pounds per annum, out of the forfeited estates, to Tyrconnel, in acknowledgement of his signal services<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they imposed a tax of twenty thousand pounds per month for the service of the king: the royal assent was given to an act for liberty of conscience: they enacted that the tythes payable by papists should be delivered to priests of that communion: the maintenance of the protestant clergy in cities and corpora∣tions was taken away: and all dissenters were exempted from ecclesiastical ju∣risdictions. So that the established church was deprived of all power and pre∣rogative; notwithstanding the express promise of James, who had declared im∣mediately after his landing, that he would maintain the clergy in their rights and privileges</P>

<P>Nor was the king less arbitrary in the executive part of his government, if we suppose that he countenanced the grievous acts of oppression that were daily committed upon the protestant subjects of Ireland: but the tyranny of his proceedings may be justly imputed to the temper of his ministry, con∣sisting of men abandoned to all sense of justice and humanity, who acted from the dictates of rapa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity and revenge, inflamed with all the acrimony of re∣ligious rancour. Soldiers were permitted to live upon free quarter; the people were robbed and plundered; licences and protections were abused, in order to extort money from the trading part of the nation. The king's old stores were ransacked, the shops of tradesmen, and the kitchens of burghers, were pillaged to supply the mint with a quantity of brass, which was converted into current coin for his majesty's occasions. An arbitrary value was set upon it, and all persons were required and commanded to take it in payment, un∣der the severest penalties, though the proportion between its intrinsic worth and currency was nearly as one to three hundred. A vast sum of this counter∣feit
<PB N="27" REF="300"/>
coin was issued in the course of one year, and forced upon the protestants in payment of merchandize, provision, and necessaries for the king's service. James, not content with the supply granted by parliament, imposed by his own authority a tax of twenty thousand pounds per month on chattels, as the former was laid upon lands. This seems to have been a temporary expedient, during the adjournment of the two houses, as the term of the assessment was limited to three months: it was, however, levied by virtue of a commission under the seals; and seems to have been a stretch of the prerogative the less excusable, as he might have obtained the money in a parliamentary way. Understanding that the protestants had laid out all their brass money, in pur∣chasing great quantities of hides, tallow, wool, and corn, he assumed the despotic power of fixing the prices of these commodities, and then bought them for his own use. One may see his ministers were bent upon the utter destruction of those unhappy people.</P>

<P>All vacancies in public schools were supplied with popish teachers. The pension allowed from the exchequer to the university of Dublin, was cut off: the vice-provost, fellows, and scholars, were expelled: their furniture, plate, and public library, were seized, without the least shadow of pretence, and in direct violation of the king's promise to preserve their privileges and immu∣nities. His officers converted the college into a garrison, the chapel into a magazine, and the apartments into prisons: a popish priest was appointed pro∣vost; one Maccarty of the same persuasion was made library-keeper; and the whole foundation was changed into a catholic seminary. When bishoprics and benefices in the gift of the crown became vacant, the king ordered the profits to be lodged in the exchequer, and suffered the cures to be totally neglected. The revenues were chiefly employed in the maintenance of romish bishops and priests, who grew so insolent under this indulgence, that in several places they forcibly seized the protestant churches. When complaint was made of this outrage, the king promised to do justice to the injured; and in some places actually ordered the churches to be restored: but the popish clergy refused to comply with his order, alledging, that in spirituals they owed obedience to no earthly power but the holy see; and James found himself unable to protect his protestant subjects against a powerful body which he durst not disoblige. Some ships appearing in the bay of Dublin, a proclamation was issued, for∣bidding the protestants to assemble in any place of worship, or elsewhere, on pain of death. By a second, they were commanded to bring in their arms, on pain of being treated as rebels and traitors. Lutterel governor of Dublin published an ordinance by beat of drum, requiring the farmers to bring in their corn for his majesty's horses within a certain day, otherwise he would order them to be hanged before their own doors. Brigadier Sarsfield com∣manded all protestants of a certain district to retire to the distance of ten miles from their habitations, on pain of death; and, in order to keep up the credit of the brass money, the same penalty was denounced, in a proclamation, against any person who should give more than one pound eighteen shillings for a guinea.</P>

the French monarch. After the return of the fleet which had conveyed him to Ireland, Lewis sent another strong squadron, commanded by Chateau Renault, as a convoy to some transports laden with arms, ammunition, and a large sum of money for the use of king James. Before they sailed from Brest, king William being informed of their destination, detached admiral Herbert from Spithead, with twelve ships of the line, one fireship, and four tenders, in order to inter∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt the enemy.

On the first day of May, he discovered them at anchor in Bantrey-bay, and stood in to engage them, though they were greatly superior to him in number. They no sooner perceived him at day-break, than they weighed, stood out to windward, formed their line, bore down and began the action, which was ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntained for two hours with equal valour on both sides, though the English fleet sustained considerable damage from the superior fire of the enemy. Herbert tacked several times, in hope of gaining the weather-gage; but the French admiral kept his wind with un∣common skill and perseverance. At length the English squadron stood off to sea, and maintained a running fight till five in the afternoon, when Chateau Renault tacked about and returned into the bay, content with the honour he had gained. The loss of men was inconsiderable on both sides; and, where the odds were so great, the victor could not reap much glory. Herbert retired to the isles of Scilly, where he expected a reinforcement; but being disap∣pointed in this expectation, he returned to Portsmouth, in very ill humour, with which his officers and men were infected. The common sailors still re∣tained some attachment to James, who had formerly been a favourite among them; and the officers complained that they had been sent upon this service with a force so much inferior to that of the enemy. King William, in order<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> to appease their discontent, made an excursion to Portsmouth, where he dined with the admiral on board the ship Elizabeth, declared his intention of creating him an earl, in consideration of his good conduct and services, conferred the honour of knighthood on the captains Ashby and Shovel, and bestowed a d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nation of ten shillings on every private sailor.</P>

<P>The parliament of England thought it incumbent upon them, not only to raise supplies for the maintenance of the war in which the nation was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>volved, but also to do justice with respect to those who had been injured by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>legal or oppressive sentences in the late reigns. The attainders of lord Rus∣sel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Algernoon Sidney, Alderman Cornish, and the lady Lisle, were now re∣versed. A committee of privileges was appointed by the lords, to examine the case of the earl of Devonshire, who in the late reign had been fined in thirty thousand pounds for assaulting colonel Culpepper in the presence-cham∣ber. They reported that the court of king's-bench, in over-ruling the earl's plea of privilege of parliament, had committed a manifest breach of privi∣lege: that the fine was excessive and exorbitant, against the great charter, the common right of the subject, and the law of the realm. The sentence pronounced upon Samuel Johnson chaplain to lord Russel, in consequence of which he had been degraded, fined, scourged, and set in the pillory, was now annulled, and the commons recommended him to his majesty for some ecclesiastical
<PB N="29" REF="320"/>
prefe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent. He received one thousand pounds in money, with a pen∣sion of three hundred pounds for his own life and that of his son, who was moreover gratified with a place of one hundred pounds a year; but the father never obtained any ecclesiastical benefice. Titus Oates seized this opportunity of petitioning the house of lords for a reversal of the judgment given against him on his being convicted of perjury. The opinions of all the judges and counsel at the bar were heard on this subject, and a bill of reversal passed the commons; but the peers having inserted some amendments and a proviso, a conference was demanded, and violent heats ensued. Oates, however, was released from confinement; and the lords, with the consent of the commons, recommended him to his majesty for a pardon, which he obtained, together with a comfortable pension. The committee appointed to inquire into the cases of the state-prisoners, found Sir Robert Wright, late lord chief justice to have been concerned in the cruelties committed in the West after the insur∣rection of Monmouth; as also one of the ecclesiastical commissioners, and guilty of manifold enormities. Death had by this time delivered Jeffries from the resentment of the nation. Graham and Burton, who had acted as sollici∣tors in the illegal prosecutions carried on against those who opposed the court in the reign of Charles II. were reported guilty of having been instrumental in taking away the lives and estates of those who had suffered the loss of either under colour of law for eight years last past; of having, by malicious in∣dictments, informations, and prosecutions of Quo Warranto, endeavoured the subversion of the protestant religion, and the government of the realm; and of having wasted many thousand pounds of the public revenue in the course of these infamous practices.</P>

<P>Nor did the misconduct of the present ministry escape the ani∣madversion of the parliament. The lords having addressed the king to put the isle of Wight, Jersey, Guernsey, Scilly, Dov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r-castle, and the other for∣tresses of the kingdom, in a posture of defence, and to disarm the papists, em∣powered a committee to enquire into the miscarriages in Ireland, which were generally imputed to the neglect of the marquisses of Caermarthen and Halli∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ax. They presented an address to the king, desiring the minute book of the committee for Irish affairs might be put into their hands; but his majesty de∣clined gratifying them in this particular: then the commons voted, that those persons who had advised the king to delay this satisfaction were enemies to the kingdom. William, alarmed at this resolution, allowed them to inspect the book, in which they found very little for their purpose. The house re∣solved that an address should be presented to his majesty, declaring that the succour of Ireland had been retarded by unnecessary delays; that the transports prepared were not sufficient to convey the forces to that kingdom; and that several ships had been taken by the enemy, for want of proper convoy. At the same time the question was put, Whether or not they should address the king against the marquis of Hallifax? But it was carried in the negative by a small majority. Before this period, Howe vice-chamberlain to the queen had moved for an address against such counsellors as had been impeached in par∣liament, and betrayed the liberties of the nation. This motion was levelled at Carma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rthen and Hallifax, the first of whom had been formerly impeached of high treason, under the title of earl of Danby; and the other was charged
<PB N="$0" REF="330"/>
with all the misconduct of the present administration. Warm debates ensued, and in all probability the motion would have been carried in the affirmative, had not those who spoke warmly in behalf of it, suddenly cooled in the course of the dispute. Some letters from king James to his partisans being inter∣cepted, and containing some hints of an intended invasion, Mr. Hambden, chairman of the committee of the whole house, enlarged upon the imminent danger to which the kingdom was exposed, and moved for a further supply to his majesty. In this unexpected motion, he was not seconded by one mem∣ber. The house, however, having taken the letters into consideration, resolved to draw up an address to the king, de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring him to secure and disarm all pa∣pists of note; and they brought in a bill for attainting several persons in re∣bellion against their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ajesties; but it was not finished during this session.</P>

They were per∣su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded to return to their respective places of abode: precautions were taken against a second riot; and the bill was unanimously rejected in the upper house. This parliament passed an act, vesting the presentations belonging to papists in the two universities; those of the southern counties being given to Oxford; and those of the northern to Cambridge, on certain specified conditions. Courts of conscience were erected at Bristol, Gloucester, and Newcastle; and that of the Marches of Wales was abolished, as an intolerable oppression on that country. The protestant clergymen who had been forced to leave their bene∣fices in Ireland, were rendered capable of holding any living in England, with∣out forfeiting their title to their former preferment, with the proviso that they should resign their English benefices when restored to those they had been obliged to relinquish. The statute of Henry IV. against multiplying gold and silver was now repealed: the subjects were allowed to melt and refine metals and ores, and extract gold and silver from them, on condition that it should be brought to the Mint and converted into money, the owners receiving its full value in current coin. These, and several other bills of smaller im∣portance being passed, the two houses adjourned to the twentieth day of Sep∣tember, and afterwards to the nineteenth day of October.</P>

<P>THOUGH the affairs of Ireland were extremely pressing, and the protestants of that country had made repeated application for relief, the succours were retarded either by the disputes among the ministers, or the neglect of those who had the management of the expedition, in such a manner, that king James had been six months in Ireland before the army was embarked for that kingdom. At length, eighteen regiments of infantry, and five of dra∣goons being raised for that service, a train of artillery provided, and transports
<PB N="32" REF="350"/>
prepared, the duke of Schomberg, on whom king William had conferred the chief command of this armament, set out for Chester, after he had in person thanked the commons for the uncommon regard they had payed to his services; and received assurances from the house that they would pay particular attention to him and his army. On the thirteenth day of August he landed in the neigh∣bourhood of Carrick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ergus with about ten thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oot and dragoons, and took possession of Be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fast, from whence the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y retired at his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pproach to Carrick∣sergus, where they resolved to make a stand. The duke having refreshed his men, marched thither and invested the place<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the siege was carried on till the twenty-sixth day of the month, when the breaches being practicable, the be∣sieged capitulated, on condition of marching out with their arms and as much baggage as they could carry on their backs; and of their being conducted to the next Irish garrison, which was at Newry. During this siege the duke was joined by the rest of his army from England; but, he had left orders for conveying the greater part of the artillery and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tores from Chester directly to Carling∣ford. He now began his march through Lisburne and Hilsborough, encamped at Drummore, where the protestants of the North had been lately routed by Hamilton; thence he proceeded to Loughbrillane, where he was joined by the hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e and dragoons of In<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>killin. Then the enemy abandoned Newry and Dun∣dalk, in the neighbourhood of which Schomberg encamped on a low, damp, ground, having the town and river on the south, and surrounded on every other part by hills, bogs, and mountains.</P>

<P>His army consisting chiefly of new-raised men little inured to hardship, began to flag under the fatigue of marching, the inclemency of the weather, and scarcity of provision. Here he was reinforced by the regiments of Kirke, Hanmer, and Stuart; and would have continued his march to Drogheda, where he understood Rosene lay with about twenty thousand men, had not he been obliged to wait for the artillery, which was not yet arrived at Carlingford. King James having assembled all his forces, advanced towards Schomberg, and ap∣peared before his intrenchments in order of battle; but, the duke knowing they were greatly supetior in number of horse, and that his own army was undisci∣plined, and weakened by death and sickness, restrained his men within the lines; and in a little time the enemy retreated. Immediately after their departure, a conspiracy was discovered in the English camp, hatched by some French papists, who had insinuated themselves into the protestant regiments. One of these, whose name was Du Plessis, had written a letter to the ambassador D'Avaux, pro∣mising to desert with all the papists of the three French regiments in Schomberg's army. This letter being found, Du Plessis and five accomplices were tried by a court-martial, and executed. About two hundred and fifty papists being dis∣covered in the French regiments, they were sent over to England, and from thence to Holland. Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Schomberg remained in this situation, the Inniskil∣liners made excursions in the neighbourhood, under the command of colonel Lloyd; and on the twenty-seventh day of September, they obtained a complete victory over five times their number of the Irish; having killed seven hun∣dred on the spot, and taken O Kelly their commander, with about fifty off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cers, and a considerable booty of cattle. The duke was so pleased with their behavi∣our on this occasion, that they received a very honourable testimony of his ap∣probation.</P>

<P>Mean while the enemy took possession of James-Town, and reduced Sligo, one of the forts of which was gallantly defended by St. Sauveur, a French captain, and his company of grenadiers, until he was obliged to capitulate for want of water and provision. A contagious distemper still continued to rage in Schomberg's camp, and swept off a great number of officers and soldiers: so that in the beginning of next spring, not above half the number of those who went over with the general, remained alive. He was censured for his in∣activity; and the king in repeated letters desired him to hazard an engagement, provided any opportunity should occur: but, he did not think proper to run the risque of a battle, against an enemy that was above thrice his number, well∣disciplined, healthy, and conducted by able officers. Nevertheless, he was cer∣tainly blameable for having chosen such an unwholesome situation; from whence, at the approach of winter, he retired into quarters, in hope of being reinforced with seven thousand Danes who had already arrived in Britain. These auxiliaries were stipulated in a treaty which William had just concluded with the king of Denmark. The English were not more successful at sea than they had proved in their operations by land. Admiral Herbert, now created earl of Torrington, having sailed to Ireland with the combined squadrons of England and Holland, made a fruitless attempt upon Cork, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost a great number of seamen by sickness, which was imputed to bad provision. The Dartmouth ship of war fell into the hands of the enemy, who infested the channel with such a number of armed ships and privateers, that the trade of England sustained incredible damage.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The affairs of France wore but a gloomy aspect on the continent, where all the powers of Europe seemed to have conspired her destruction. King William had engaged in a new league with the states-general, in which former treaties of peace and commerce were confirmed. It was stipulated, that in case the king of Great-Britain should be attacked, the Dutch should assist him with six thousand infantry and twenty ships of the line; and that, provided hostilities should be committed against the states-general, England should supply them with ten thousand infantry and twenty ships of war. This treaty was no sooner ratified than king William dispatched the lord Churchill, whom he had by this time created earl of Marlborough, to Holland, in order to command the British auxiliaries in that service, to the number of eleven thousand, the greater part of which had been in the army of king James when the prince of Orange landed in England. He forthwith joined the Dutch army under the command of prince Waldec, who had fixed his rendezvous in the county of Liege, with a view to act against the French army commanded by the marechal D'Humieres, while the prince of Vaudemont headed a little army of observation, consisting of Spaniards, Dutch, and Germans, to watch the motions of Calvo in another part of the Low-Countries. The city of Liege was compelled to renounce the neu∣trality and declare for the allies. Marechal D'Humieres attacked the foragers belonging to the army of the states at Walcourt, in the month of August; an obstinate engagement ensued, and the French were obliged to retreat in confu∣sion, with the loss of two thousand men, and some pieces of artillery. The army of observation levelled part of the French lines on the side of Courtray; and raised contributions on the territories of the enemy.</P>

<P>The French were almost intire masters of the three ecclesiastical electorates of Germany. They possessed Mentz, Triers, Bonne, Keiserswaert, Philipsburg,
<PB N="34" REF="370"/>
and Land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. They had blown up the castle of Heidelberg in the Palatinate, and destroyed Manheim. They had reduced Worms and Spires to ashes; and demolished Frankendahl, together with several other fortresses. These conquests, the fruits of sudden invasion, were covered with a numerous army, commanded by the marechal de Duras; and all his inferior generals were officers of distinguished courage and ability. Nevertheless, he found it difficult to maintain his ground against the different princes of the empire. The duke of Lorraine, who com∣manded the imperial troops, invested Mentz, and took it by capitulation: the el<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tor of Brandenburgh having reduced Keiserswaert, undertook the siege of Bonne, which the garrison surrendered, after having made a long and vigorous defence. Nothing contributed more to the union of the German princes than their resentment of the shocking barbarity with which the French had plun∣dered, wasted, and depopulated their country. Lewis having by his intrigues in Poland, and at Constantinople, prevented a pacification between the empe∣ror and the Ottoman-porte, the campaign was opened in Croatia, where five thousand Turks were defeated by a body of Croats between Vihitz and Novi. The prince of Baden, who commanded the Imperialists on that side, having thrown a bridge over the Morava at Passarowitz, crossed that river, and marched in quest of the Turkish army, amounting to fifty thousand men, headed by a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eraskier. On the thirtieth day of August he attacked the enemy in their en∣trenchments near Patochin, forced their lines, routed them with great slaugh∣ter, and took possession of their camp, baggage, and artillery. They retreated to Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a, where their general finding them still more numerous than the Impe∣rialists, resolved to make a stand; and encamped in a situation that was inac∣cessible in every part except the rear, which he left open for the convenience of a retreat. Through this avenue he was, on the twenty-fourth day of September, attacked by the prince of Baden, who, after a desperate resistance, obtained an∣other complete victory, enriched his troops with the spoils of the enemy; and entered Nissa without opposition. There he found above three thousand horses and a vast quantity of provision. Having reposed his army for a few days in this place, he resumed his march against the Turks, who had chosen an advan∣tageous post at Widin, and seemed ambitious of retrieving the honour they had lost in the two former engagements. The Germans attacked their lines with∣out he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itation; and though the Mussulmans fought with incredible fury, they were a third time defeated with great slaughter. This defeat was attended with the loss of Widin, which being surrendered to the victor, he distributed his troops in winter-quarters, and returned to Vienna covered with laurels.</P>

<P>The French were likewise baffled in their attempt upon Catalonia, where the duke de Noailles had taken Campredon, in the month of May. Leaving a garrison in this place, he retreated to the frontiers of France, while the duke de Villa Hermosa, at the head of a Spanish army, blocked up the place, and laid Rousillon under contribution. He afterwards undertook the siege in form, and Noailles marched to its relief; but, he was so hard pressed by the Spaniards, that he withdrew the garrison, dismantled the place, and retreated with great precipitation. The French king hoped to derive some considerable advantage from the death of pope Innocent XI. which happened on the twelfth day of August. That pontiff had been an inveterate enemy to Lewis ever since the affair of the franchises, and the seizure of Avignon. Cabals were imme∣diately formed at Rome by the French faction, against the Spanish and Impe∣rial
<PB N="35" REF="380"/>
interest. The French cardinals de Bouillon and Bonzi, accompanied by Furstemberg, repaired to Rome with a large sum of money. Peter Otto∣boni, a Venetian, was elected pope, and assumed the name of Alexander VIII. The duke de Chaulnes ambassador from France, immediately signified, in the name of his master, that Avignon should be restored to the patrimony of the church; and Lewis renounced the franchises in a letter written by his own hand to the new pontiff. Alexander received these marks of respect with the warmest acknowledgments; but, when the ambassador and Furstemberg besought him to re-examine the election of the bishop of Cologne, which had been the source of so much calamity to the empire, he lent a deaf ear to their sollicitations. He even confirmed the dispensations granted by his predecessor to the prince of Bavaria, who was thus impowered to take possession of the electorate, though he had not yet attained the age required by the canons. Furstemberg retired in disgust to Paris, where Lewis immediately gratified him with the abbey of St. Germains.</P>

Many were dissatisfied with his measures; and a great number even of those who had exerted themselves for his elevation, had conceived a disgust from his personal deportment, which was very unsuitable to the manners and disposition of the English people. Instead of mingling with his nobility in social amuse∣ments and familiar conversation, he maintained a disagreeable reserve which had all the air of sullen pride; he seldom or never spoke to his courtiers or attend∣ants; he spent his time chiefly in the closet retired from all communication; or among his troops in a camp he had formed at Hounslow; or in the exercise of hunting, to which he was immoderately addicted. This had been prescribed to him by physicians, as necessary to improve his constitution, which was naturally weak; and by practice had become so habitual, that he could not lay it aside. His ill health co-operating with his natural aversion to society, produced a peevishness which could not fail of being displeasing to those who were near his person; and this was increased by the disputes in his cabinet, and the opposition of those who were professed enemies to his government, as well as by the aliena∣tion of his former friends. As he could not breathe without difficulty in the air of London, he resided chiefly at Hampton-Court, and expended consider∣able sums in beautifying and enlarging that palace; he likewise purchased the house at Kensington of the earl of Nottingham; and such profusion, in the be∣ginning of an expensive war, gave umbrage to the nation in general. Whether he was advised by his counsellors, or his own sagacity pointed out the expedi∣ency of conforming with the English humour, he now seemed to change his disposition, and in some measure adopt the manners of his predecessors. In imitation of Charles II. he resorted to the races at Newmarket; he accepted an invitation to visit Cambridge, where he behaved with remarkable affability to the members of the university; he afterwards dined with the lord-mayor of London, accepted the freedom of the city, and condescended so far as to become sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>master of the company of grocers.</P>

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>While William thus endeavoured to remove the prejudices which had been conceived against his person, the period arrived which the parliament had
<PB N="36" REF="390"/>
prescribed for taking the oaths to the new government. Some individuals of the clergy sacrificed their benefices to their scruples of conscience; and abso∣lutely refused to take oaths that were contrary to those they had already sworn in favour of their late sovereign. These were distinguished by the epithet of Nonjurors; but their number bore a very small proportion to that of others, who took them with such reservations and distinctions as redounded very little to the honour of their integrity. Many of those who had been the warmest advocates for non-resistance and passive obedience, made no scruple of renounc∣ing their allegiance to king James, and complying with the present act, after having declared that they took the oaths in no other sense than that of a peaceable submission to the powers that were. They even affirmed that the legislature itself had allowed the distinction between a king de facto and a king de jure, as they had dropped the word "rightful" when the form was under debate. They alledged that as prudence obliged them to conform to the letter of the oath, so conscience required them to give it their own interpretation. Nothing could be more infamous, and of worse tendency, than this practice of equivocating in the most sacred of all obligations. It introduced a general disregard of oaths, which hath been the source of universal perjury and corruption. Though this set of temporisers were bitterly upbraided both by the nonjurors and the papists, they all concurred in representing William as an enemy to the church; as a prince educated in the doctrines of Calvin, which he plainly espoused by limit∣ing his favour and preferment to such as were latitudinarians in religion, and by his abolishing episcopacy in Scotland. The presbyterians of that kingdom now tyrannised in their turn. They were headed by the earl of Crawford, a nobleman of a violent temper and strong prejudices. He was chosen president of the parliament by the interest of Melvil, and oppressed the episcopalians in such a manner, that the greater part of them, from resentment, became well∣wishers to king James. Every circumstance of the hardships they underwent, was reported in England; and the earl of Clarendon, as well as the suspended bishops, circulated these particulars with great assiduity. The oaths being re∣jected by the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishops of Ely, Chichester, Bath and Wells, Peterborough, and Gloucester, they were suspended from their func∣tions, and threatened with deprivation, Lake of Chichester being seized with a dangerous distemper, signed a solemn declaration, in which he professed his adherence to the doctrine of non-resistance and passive obedience, which he be∣lieved to be the distinguishing characteristic of the church of England. After his death, this paper was published, industriously circulated, and extolled by the party, as an inspired oracle pronounced by a martyr to religious truth and sin∣cerity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>All the clamour that was raised against the king could not divert him from prosecuting the scheme of comprehension. He granted a commission under the great seal to ten bishops, and twenty dignitaries of the church, authoris∣ing them to meet from time to time in the Jerusalem-chamber, to prepare such alteration of the liturgy and the canons, and such proposals for the reformation of ecclesiastical courts, as might most conduce to the good order, edification, and uniting of the church; and tend to reconcile all religious differences among the protestant subjects of the kingdom. A cry was immediately raised against this commission, as an ecclesiastical court illegal and dangerous. At their first
<PB N="37" REF="400"/>
meeting, the authority of the commission was questioned by Sprat bishop of Rochester, who retired in disgust, and was followed by Mew of Winchester, and the doctors Jane and Aldrich. These were averse to any alteration of the forms and constitution of the church, in favour of an insolent and obstinate party, which ought to have been satisfied with the toleration they enjoyed. They observed, that an attempt to make such alteration would divide the clergy, and bring the liturgy into <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isesteem with the people, as it would be a plain acknowledgment that it wanted correction. They thought they should violate the dignity of the church, by condescending to make offers which the dissenters were at liberty to refuse; and they suspected some of their colleagues of a design to give up episcopal ordination; a step inconsistent with their honour, duty, oaths, and subscriptions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>The commissioners, notwithstanding this secession, proceeded to debate with moderation on the abuses of which the dissenters had complained, and corrected every article that seemed liable to any just objection: but the op∣posite party employed all their art and industry to inflame the minds of the people: the two universities declared against all alterations, and those who promoted them: the king himself was branded as an enemy to the hierarchy; and they bestirred themselves so successfully in the election of members for the convocation, that they procured a very considerable majority. At their first meeting, the friends of the comprehension scheme proposed Dr. Tillotson clerk of the closet to his majesty as prolocutor; but the other party carried it in favour of Dr. Jane, who was counted the most violent churchman in the whole assembly. In a Latin speech to the bishop of London as president, he, in the name of the lower house, asserted, that the liturgy of England needed no amendment, and concluded with the old declaration of the barons, <Q>“Nolumus leges Angliae mutari.”</Q> We will not suffer the laws of England to be changed. The bishop, in his reply, exhorted them to moderation, charity, and indulgence, towards their brethren the dissenters; and to make such abate∣ments in things indifferent as might serve to open a door of salvation to mul∣titudes of straying christians. His injunctions, however, produced no favour∣able effect. The lower house seemed to be animated by a spirit of opposition; and next day the president prorogued them, on pretence that the royal commission by which they were to act was defective, for want of being sealed; and that a prorogation was necessary, until that sanction should be obtained. In this in∣terval, means were used to mollify their noncompliant tempers; but all en∣deavours proved ineffectual. When they met again, the earl of Nottingham delivered the king's commission to both houses, with a speech of his own, and a message from his majesty, importing, that he had summoned them out of a pious zeal to do every thing that might tend to the best establishment of the church of England, which should always enjoy his favour and protection. He exhorted them to lay aside all prejudice; to consider calmly and impartially whatever should be proposed: he assured them he would offer nothing but what should be for the honour, peace, and advantage, of the protestant re∣ligion in general, and particularly of the church of England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The bishops adjourning to the Jerusalem-chamber, prepared a zealous address of thanks to his majesty, which being sent to the lower house for their concurrence, met with violent opposition. Amendments were proposed, a
<PB N="38" REF="410"/>
conference ensued, and, after warm debates, they agreed upon a cold address, which was accordingly presented. The majority of the lower house, far from taking any measures in favour of dissenters, converted all their attention to the relief of their nonjuring brethren. Zealous speeches were made in behalf of the suspended bishops; and Dr. Jane proposed that something might be done to qualify them to sit in the convocation. This, however, was such a dangerous point as they would not venture to discuss. Yet, rather than proceed upon the business for which they had been assembled, they began to take cogni∣zance of some pamphlets lately published, which they conceived to be of dan∣gerous consequence to the christian religion. The president and his party per∣ceiving the disposition of the house, did not think proper to communicate any proposal touching the intended reformation; and the king suffered the session to be discontinued by repeated prorogations.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament meeting on the nineteenth day of October, the king, in a speech of his own composing, explained the necessity of a present supply to carry on the war; desired that they might be speedy in their determinations on this subject; for these would in a great measure influence the deliberations of the princes and states concerned in the war against France, as a general meeting of them was appointed to be held next month at the Hague, to settle the operations of the ensuing campaign. He concluded with recommending the dispatch of a bill of indemnity, that the minds of his subjects might be quieted; and that they might unanimously concur in promoting the honour and welfare of the kingdom. As several inflammatory bills and disputes, which had produced heats and animosities in the last session, were still depend∣ing, the king, after having consulted both houses, resolved to put an end to those disputes by a prorogation. He accordingly went to the house of lords, and prorogued the parliament till the twenty first day of October, by the mouth of the new speaker Sir Robert Atkins, the marquis of Hallifax having re∣signed that office. When they reassembled, the king referred them to his former speech; then the commons unanimously resolved to assist his majesty in reducing Ireland, and in joining with his allies abroad for a vigorous pro∣secution of the war against France: for these purposes they voted a supply of two millions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>During this session the Whigs employed all their influence and in∣trigues in obstructing the bill of indemnity, which they knew would open a door for favour and preferment to the opposite party, which began to gain ground in the king's good graces. With this view they revived the prosecution of the state prisoners. A committee was appointed to prepare a charge against Burton and Graham. The commons resolved to impeach the earls of Peter∣borough, Salisbury, and Castlemain, Sir Edward Hales, and Obadiah Walker, of high treason, for having been reconciled to the church of Rome, contrary to the laws of the realm. A bill was ordered to be brought in to declare the estate of the late lord chancellor Jeffries forfeited to the crown, and attaint his blood; but it met with such opposition that the measure was dropped: the house however agreed, that the pecuniary penalties incurred by those persons who had exercised offices contrary to the laws against popish recusants, should be speedily levied, and applied to the public service. The lord Griffin being detected in maintaining a correspondence with king James and his partisans,
<PB N="39" REF="420"/>
was committed to the Tower; but, as no other evidence appeared against him than written letters, found in the false bottom of a pewter bottle, they could not help consenting to his being released upon bail, as they had lately resolved that Algernoon Sidney had been unjustly condemned, because nothing but writings had been produced against him at his trial. The two houses con∣curred in appointing a committee to enquire who were advisers and prosecutors in taking away the lives of lord Russel, colonel Sydney, Sir Thomas Arm∣strong, alderman Cornish, and others; and who were chiefly concerned in the arbitrary practices touching the writs of Quo Warranto, and the surrender of charters. This inquiry was levelled at the marquis of Hallifax, who had concurred with the ministry of Charles in all those severities; and, though no proof appeared upon which votes or addresses could be founded, that noble∣man saw it was necessary for him to withdraw himself from the administration. He therefore resigned the privy-seal, which was put in commission, and re∣conciled himself to the Tories, of whom he became the patron and pro∣tector.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The commons likewise resumed the examination of the miscarriages in Ireland; and desired the king would appoint commissioners to go over and inquire into the condition of the army in that kingdom. Schomberg under∣standing that he had been blamed in the house of commons for his inactivity, transmitted to the king a satisfactory vindication of his own conduct; and it appeared that the miscarriages in Ireland were wholly owing to John Shales purveyor-general to the army. The commons immediately presented an ad∣dress to his majesty, praying that Shales might be taken into custody; that all his papers, accounts, and stores, should be secured; and that duke Schomberg might be impowered to fill his place with a more able purveyor. The king gave them to understand, that he had already sent orders to the ge∣neral for that purpose. Nevertheless, they in another petition requested his majesty to name those who had recommended Shales to his service, as he had exercised the same office under king James, and was suspected of treasonable practices against the government. William declined gratifying their request; but he afterwards sent a message to the house, desiring them to recommend a certain number of commissioners to superintend such provisions and prepara∣tions as might be necessary for that service; as well as to nominate certain persons to go over and examine the state of the army in Ireland. The com∣mons were so mollified by this instance of his condescension, that they left the whole affair to his own direction, and proceeded to examine other branches of misconduct. Instances of mismanagement appeared so numerous and so fla∣grant, that they resolved upon a subsequent address, to explain the ill conduct and success of his army and navy; to desire he would find out the authors of these miscarriages, and for the future entrust unsuspected persons with the ma∣nagement of affairs. They ordered the victuallers of the fleet to be taken into custody, on suspicion of having furnished the navy with unwholesome pro∣visions; and new commissioners were appointed. Bitter reproaches were thrown out against the ministry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mr. Hambden expressed his surprize that the administration should consist of those very persons whom king James had employed when his affairs were desperate, to treat with the prince of Orange; and moved that the king should be petitioned in an address to remove such
<PB N="40" REF="430"/>
persons from his presence and councils. This was a stroke aimed at the earl of Nottingham, whose office of secretary Hambden desired to possess: but his motion was not seconded, the court-members observing that James did not depute those lords to the prince of Orange because they were attached to his own interest, but for a very different reason, namely, that they were well known to disapprove of his measures; and therefore would be the more agreeable to his highness. The house, however, voted an address to the king, desiring that the authors of the miscarriages might be brought to condign punishment.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>In the sequel, the question was proposed, Whether a placeman ought to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat in the house? And a very warm debate ensued; but it was carried in the affirmative, on the supposition that by such exclusion the commonwealth would be deprived of some of the ablest senators of the kingdom. But what chiefly irritated William against the Whigs, was their backwardness in pro∣moting the public service; and their disregard of the earnest desire he ex∣pressed to see his revenue settled for life. He said his title was no more than a pageant; and the worst of all governments was that of a king without treasure. Nevertheless, they would not grant the civil list for a longer term than one year. They began to think there was something arbitrary in his disposition. His sullen behaviour in all probability first infused this opinion, which was strengthened and confirmed by the insinuations of his enemies. The Scots, who had come up to London to give an account of the proceed∣ings in their parliament, were infected with the same notion. One Simp∣son, a presbyterian of that country, whom the earl of Portland employed as a spy, had insinuated himself into the confidence of Nevil Payne, an active and intelligent partisan, and agen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of king James; by which means he supplied the earl with such intelligence as raised him to some degree of credit with that minister. This he used in prepossessing the earl against the king's best friends, and infusing jealousies which were soon kindled into mutual distrust and ani∣mosity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Sir James Montgomery, who had been a warm advocate for the revolution, received advice that the court suspected him and others of disaf∣fection, and was employed in seeking evidence by which they might be pro∣secuted. They were equally alarmed and incensed at this intimation, and Payne seized the opportunity of seducing them into a correspondence with the exiled king. They demanded the settlement of presbytery in Scotland, and actually engaged in a treaty for his restoration. They reconciled themselves to the duke of Queensberry, and the other noblemen of the episcopal party: they wrote to James for a supply of money, arms, and ammunition, together with a reinforcement of three thousand men from Dunkirk. Montgomery had acquired great interest among the Whigs of England, and this he em∣ployed in animating them against the king and the ministry. He represented them as a set of wicked men, who employed infamous spies to ensnare and ruin the fast friends of the government; and found means to alienate them so much from William, that they began to think in earnest of recalling their banished prince. The duke of Bolton and the earl of Monmouth were almost persuaded into a conspiracy for this purpose: they seemed to think James was now so well convinced of his former errors, that they might trust him with∣out scruple. Montgomery and Payne were the chief managers of the scheme;
<PB N="41" REF="440" MS="y"/>
and they admitted Ferguson into their councils, as a veteran in the arts of treason. In order to blast William's credit in the city, they circulated a report that James would grant a full indemnity, separate himself entirely from the French interest, and be contented with a secret connivance in favour of the roman catholics. Montgomery's brother assured the bishop of Salisbury, that a treaty with king James was absolutely concluded, and an invitation sub∣scribed by the whole cabal. He said this paper would be sent to Ireland by the way of France, as the direct communication was difficult; and he pro∣posed a method for seizing it before it should be conveyed out of the kingdom. Williamson, the supposed bearer of it, had obtained a pass for Flanders; and a messenger being sent in pursuit of him, secured his cloaths and portmanteau; but, after a very strict examination, nothing appeared to justify the intelli∣gence. Williamson had previously delivered the papers to Simpson, who hired a boat at Deal, and arrived in safety at France. He returned with large assurances, and twelve thousand pounds were remitted to the Scottish under∣takers. Montgomery the informer, seeing his intelligence falsified, lost his credit with the bishop, and dreading the resentment of the other party, re∣tired to the continent. The conspirators loudly complained of the false im∣putations they had incurred. The pretended discoveries were looked upon as fictions of the ministry, and the king on this occasion suffered greatly in the opinion of his subjects.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The Tories still continued to carry on a secret negotiation with the court. They took advantage of the ill humour subsisting between the king and the Whigs; and promised large supplies of money, provided this parlia∣ment should be dissolved, and another immediately convoked. The opposite party being apprised of their intention, brought a bill into the house of commons for restoring corporations to their antient rights and privileges. They knew their own strength at elections consisted in these corporations; and they inserted two additional severe clauses against those who were in any shape concerned in surrendering charters. The whole power of the Tories was ex∣erted against this clause; and now the Whigs vied with them in making court to his majesty, promising to manifest the most submissive obedience should this bill be enacted into a law. The strength of the Tories was now become so formidable in the house, that they outvoted the other party, and the clauses were rejected; but the bill passed in its original form. The lords debated upon the point, Whether a corporation could be forfeited or surren∣dered? Lord chief justice Holt and two other judges declared their opinion in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>firmative: the rest thought otherwise, as no precedents could be pro∣duced farther back than the reign of Henry VIII. when the abbies were sur∣rendered; and this instance seemed too violent to authorise such a measure in a regular course of administration. The bill, however, passed by one voice only. Then both parties quickened their applications to the king, who found himself so perplexed and distracted between two factions which he equally feared, that he resolved to leave the government in the queen's hands, and retire to Holland. He communicated this design to the marquis of Car∣maerthen, the earl of Shrewsbury, and some other noblemen, who pressed him to lay aside this resolution, and even mingled tears in their remon∣strances.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<PB N="42" REF="450"/>
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>He at length complied with their request, and determined to finish the Irish war in person. This design was far from being agreeable to the par∣liament. His friends dreaded the climate of that country, which might prove fatal to his weak constitution. The well-wishers of James were afraid of that prince's being h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd pressed, should William take the field against him in person: both houses therefore began to prepare an address against this expedition. In order to prevent this remonstrance, the king went to the parliament, and formally signified his resolution. After his speech they were prorogued to the second day of April. On the sixth day of February they were dissolved by proclamation, and a new parliament was summoned to meet on the twentieth day of March. During this session, the commons, in an address to the king, desired that a revenue of fifty thousand pounds might be settled upon the prince and princess of Denmark, out of the civil list; and his majesty gratified them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s particular; though the warmth and industry with which the friends of the princess exerted themselves in promoting the settlement, produced a coldness and misunderstanding between the two sisters; and the subsequent disgrace of the earl of Marlborough was imputed to the part which his wife acted on the occasion. She was lady of the bed-chamber, and chief confi∣dent to the princess, whom she strenuously advised to insist upon the settle∣ment, rather than depend upon the generosity of the king and queen.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>About this period, general Ludlow, who at the restoration had been excepted from the act of indemnity, as one of those who sat in judg∣ment upon Charles I. arrived in England, and offered his service in reducing Ireland, where he had formerly commanded. Though a rigid republican, he was reputed a conscientious man, and a good officer. He had received some encouragement to come over, and probably would have been employed, had not the commons interposed. Sir Edward Seymour, who enjoyed by grant an estate in Wiltshire, which had formerly belonged to Ludlow, began to be in pain for his possession. He observed in the house, that the nation would be disgraced, should one of the parricides be suffered to live in the kingdom. An address was immediately presented to the king, desiring a proclamation might be issued, promising a reward for apprehending general Ludlow. This was accordingly published; but not before he had landed in Holland, from whence he returned to Vevay in Swisserland, where he wrote the memoirs of his life, and died after an exile of thirty years.</P>

<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>While king William fluctuated between two parties in England, his interest in Scotland had well nigh given way to a coalition between the original Jacobites, and Montgomery's party of discontented presbyterians. Colonel Can∣non, who succeeded the viscount Dundee in command, af<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er having made se∣veral unsuccesful efforts in favour of the late king's interest, retired into Ireland; and the Highlanders chose Sir Hugh Cameron for their leader. Under him they renewed their incur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ons with the better prospect of succes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as several re∣giments of the regular troops had been sent to reinforce the army of Schom∣berg. James assisted them with cloaths, arms, and ammunition, together with some officers, amongst whom was colonel Buchan, appointed to act as their chief commander This officer, at the head of fifteen hundred men, advanced into the shire of Murray, in hope of being joined by other male∣contents: but he was surprised and routed by Sir Thomas Livingstone, while
<PB N="43" REF="460"/>
major Ferguson destroyed the places they possessed in the isle of Mull; so that the Highlanders were obliged to retire and conceal themselves among their hills and fastnesses. The friends of James despairing of doing any thing effectual for his service in the field, converted all their attention to the pro∣ceedings in parliament, where they imagined their interest was much stronger than it appeared to be upon trial. They took the oaths without hesitation, and hoped, by the assistance of their new allies, to embroil the government in such a manner that the majority of the people would declare for a restora∣tion. But the views of these new cemented parties were altogether incompati∣ble; and their principles diametrically opposite. Notwithstanding their con∣currence in parliament, the earl of Melvil procured a small majority. The op∣position was immediately discouraged; some individuals retracted, rather than fall with a sinking cause; and mutual jealousies began to prevail. The leaders of the coalition treated separately with king James; made inconsistent demands; reciprocally concealed their negotiations; in a word, they distrusted and hated one another with the most implacable resentment.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The earls of Argyle, Anandale, and Braidalbin, withdrew from their councils, and repaired to England. Montgomery, terrified at their defection, went privately to London, after he had hinted something of the plot to Melvil, and sollicited a pass from the queen, which was refused. Anandale having re∣ceived information that Montgomery had disclosed all the particulars of the ne∣gotiation, threw himself upon the queen's mercy, and discovered all he knew of the conspiracy. As he had not treated with any of the malecontents in Eng∣land, they remained secure from his evidence; but, he informed against Nevil Payne, who had been sent down as their agent to Scotland, where he now resided. He was immediately apprehended by the council of that kingdom, in conse∣quence of a letter from the earl of Nottingham; and twice put to the torture, which he resolutely bore without discovering his employers. Montgomery still absconded in London, soliciting a pardon; but, finding he could not obtain it, except on condition of making a full discovery, he abandoned his country and chose to die in exile, rather than betray his confederates. This disunion of the conspirators and discovery of the plot, left the earl of Melvil in possession of a greater majority; though even this he was fain to secure by overstraining his instructions in the articles of patronage, and the supremacy of the crown, which he yielded up to the fury of the fanatic presbyterians, contrary to the intention of king William. In lieu of these, however, they indulged him with the tax of chimney or hearth-money; and a test to be imposed upon all persons in office and parliament, declaring William and Mary their lawful sovereigns, and re∣nouncing the pretended title of king James. All the laws in favour of episco∣pacy were repealed. Threescore of the presbyterian ministers, who had been ejected at the restoration, were still alive; and these the parliament declared the only sound part of the church. The government of it was lodged in their hands; and they were impowered to admit such as they should think proper, to their assistance. A few furious fanatics being thus associated, proceeded with ungovernable violence to persecute the episcopal party, exercising the very same tyranny against which they themselves had so loudly exclaimed.</P>

<DIV4 N="22" TYPE="section">

<P>While the presbyterian interest thus triumphed in Scotland, the two parties that divided England, employed their whole influence and attention
<PB N="44" REF="470"/>
in managing the elections for a new parliament; and the Tories obtained the victory. The king seemed gradually falling into the arms of this party. They complained of their having been totally excluded from the lieutenancy of London at the king's accession to the crown; and now a considerable num∣ber of the most violent Tories in the city was admitted into the commission by the interest and address of the bishop of London, the marquis of Carmaerthen, and the earl of Nottingham. To gratify that party, the earls of Monmouth and Warrington were dismissed from their employments; nay, when the parliament<NOTE PLACE="marg">B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>net.

He was a bold artful man, and undertook to pro∣cure a majority to be at the devotion of the court, provided he should be supplied with the necessary sums for the purposes of corruption. William find∣ing there was no other way of maintaining his administration in peace, thought proper to countenance the practice of purchasing votes; and appointed Trevor<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1690.</NOTE> first commissioner of the great seal. In his speech to the new parliament, he gave them to understand, that he still persisted in his resolution of going in per∣son to Ireland. He desired they would make a settlement of the revenue, or establish it for the present, as a fund of credit, upon which the necessary sums for the service of the government might be immediately advanced: he signified his intention of sending to them an act of grace, with a few exceptions, that he might manifest his readiness to extend his protection to all his subjects; and leave no colour of excuse for raising disturbances in his absence, as he knew how busy some ill affected men were in their endeavours to alter the established government: he recommended an union with Scotland, the parliament of which had appointed commissioners for that purpose: he told them he should leave the administration in the hands of the queen; and desired they would prepare an act to confirm her authority: he exhorted them to dispatch the business for which they were assembled; to avoid debates; and expressed his hope that they should soon meet again to finish what might be now left imperfect.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The commons, in compliance with his request, voted a supply of twelve hundred thousand pounds, one million of that sum to be raised by a clause of credit in the revenue-bills; but, he could not prevail upon them to settle the revenue for life. They granted, however, the hereditary excise for that term; but the customs for four years only. They considered this short term as the best security the kingdom could have for frequent parliaments; though this precaution was not at all agreeable to their sovereign. A poll-bill was likewise passed; other supplies were granted; and both parties seemed to court his majesty by advancing money on those funds of credit. The Whigs however had another battery in reserve. They produced, in the upper house, a bill for recognizing their majesties as the rightful and lawful sovereigns of these realms; and for declaring all the acts of the last parliament to be good and valid. The Tories were now reduced to a very perplexed situation. They could not oppose the bill without hazarding the interest they had so lately ac∣quired, nor assent to it without solemnly renouncing their former arguments and distinctions. They made no great objections to the first part, and even proposed to enact, That those should be deemed good laws for the time to come; but they refused to declare them valid for that which was past. After
<PB N="45" REF="480"/>
a long debate, the bill was committed; yet the Whigs lost their majority on the report: nevertheless, the bill was recovered, and passed with some alteration in the words, in consequence of a nervous spirited protest, signed Bolton, Mac∣clesfield, Stamford, Newport, Bedford, Herbert, Suffolk, Monmouth, Dela∣mere, and Oxford. The whole interest of the court was thrown into the scale with this bill, before it would preponderate against the Tories, the chiefs of whom, with the earl of Nottingham at their head, protested in their turn. The same party in the house of commons were determined upon a vigorous oppo∣sition; and in the mean time some trifling objections were made that it might be committed for amendment; but their design was prematurely discovered by one of their faction, who chanced to question the legality of the convention, as it was not summoned by the king's writ. This insinuation was answered by Somers the solicitor-general, who observed, that if it was not a legal parliament, they who were then met, and who had taken the oaths enacted by the parlia∣ment, were guilty of high-treason: the laws repealed by it were still in force; it was their duty therefore to return to king James; and all concerned in col∣lecting and paying the money levied by the acts of that parliament, were highly criminal. The Tories were so struck with these arguments, that the bill passed without further opposition, and immediately received the royal assent. Thus the settlement was confirmed by those very people who had so loudly exclaimed against it as illegal; but, the Whigs, with all their management, would not have gained their point, had not the court been interested in the dispute.</P>

<P>There was another violent contest between the two parties, on the import of a bill requiring all subjects in office to abjure king James, on pain of imprisonment. Though the clergy were at first exempted from this test, the main body of the Tories opposed it with great vehemence, while the Whigs, under countenance of the ministry, supported it with equal vigour. It pro∣duced long and violent debates; and the two factions seemed pretty equally ballanced. At length, the Tories represented to the king, that a great deal of precious time would be lost in fruitless altercation: that those who declared against the bill would grow sullen and intractable, so as to oppose every other motion that might be made for the king's service: that, in case of its being car∣ried, his majesty must fall again into the hands of the Whigs, who would re∣new their former practices against the prerogative; and many individuals, who were now either well affected to him, or at least neutral, would become Jaco∣bites from resentment. These suggestions had such weight with king William, that he sent an intimation to the commons, desiring they would drop the de∣bate, and proceed to matters that were more pressing. The Whigs in general were disgusted at this interposition; and the earl of Shrewsbury, who had inter∣ested himself warmly in behalf of the bill, resented it so deeply, that he insisted on resigning his office of secretary of state. The king, who revered his talents and integrity, employed Dr. Tillotson and others, who were supposed to have credit with the earl, to dissuade him from quitting his employment; but, he continued deaf to all their remonstrances, and would not even comply with the request of his majesty, who pressed him to keep the seals until he should re∣turn from Ireland. Long debates were likewise managed in the house of lords, upon the bill of abjuration, or rather an oath of special fidelity to William, in opposition to James. The Tories professed themselves willing to enter into a
<PB N="46" REF="490"/>
negative engagement against the late king and his adherents; but they opposed the oath of abjuration with all their might; and the house was so equally di∣vided that neither side was willing to hazard a decision: so that all the fruits of their debates was a prolongation of the session.</P>

<P>An act was prepared for investing the queen with the administra∣tion during the king's absence; another for reversing the judgment on a Quo Warranto against the city of London, and restoring it to its antient rights and privileges; and at length, the bill of indemnity so cordially recommended by the king, passed both houses <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following persons were excepted from the benefit of this act. William, marquis of Powis; Theophilus, earl of Huntingdon; Ro∣bert, earl of Sunderland; John, earl of Melfort; Roger, earl of Castlemain; Nathaniel, lord-bishop of Durham; Thomas, lord-bishop of St. David's; Henry, lord Dover; lord Thomas Howard, Sir Edward Hales, Sir Francis Withers, Sir Edward Lutwych, Sir Thomas Jenner, Sir Nicholas But∣ler, Sir William Herbert, Sir Richard Holloway, Sir Richard Heath, Sir Roger L'Estrange, Willi∣am Molineux, Thomas Tyndesley, colonel Town∣ly, colonel Lundy, Robert Brent, Edward Mor∣gan, Philip Burton, Richard Graham, Edward Petre, Obadiah Walker, Marthew Crone, and George lord Jeffries deceased.</NOTE>. On the twenty-first day of May, the king closed the session with a short speech, in which he thanked them for the supplies they had granted; and recommended to them a punctual discharge of their duties in their respective counties, that the peace of the nation might not be interrupted in his absence. The houses were adjourned to the seventh day of July; then the parliament was prorogu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d and adjourned successively. As a further security for the peace of the kingdom, the deputy-lieutenants were authorised to raise the militia in case of necessity. All papists were prohibited to stir above five miles from their respective places of abode: a proclamation was published for appre∣hending certain disaffected persons; Sir John Cochran and Ferguson were ac∣tually arrested on suspicion of treasonable practices. On the fourth day of June the king set out for Ireland, attended by prince George of Denmark, the duke of Ormond, the earls of Oxford, Scarborough, Manchester, and many other persons of distinction: on the fourteenth day of the month he landed at Carrickfergus, from whence he immediately proceeded to Belfast, where he was met by the duke of Schomberg, the prince of Wurtemberg, major-general Kirke, and other officers. By this time colonel Wolesey, at the head of a thou∣sand men, had defeated a strong detachment of the enemy near Belturbat; Sir John Lanier had taken Bedloe-castle, and that of Charlemont, a strong post of great importance, together with Balingargy near Cavan, had been reduced. King William having reposed himself for two or three days at Belfast, visited the duke's head-quarters at Lisburne; and advancing to Hilsborough, pub∣lished an order against pressing horses, and committing violence on the country∣people. When some of his general-officers proposed cautious measures, he de∣clared he did not come to Ireland to let the grass grow under his feet. He ordered the army to encamp and be reviewed at Loughbrilland, where he found it amounted to six and thirty thousand effective men well appointed. Then he marched to Dundalk; and afterwards advanced to Ardee, which the enemy had just abandoned.</P>

<P>King James trusted so much to the disputes in the English parlia∣ment, that he did not believe his son-in-law would be able to quit that king∣dom; and he had been six days in Ireland before he received intimation of his
<PB N="47" REF="500"/>
arrival. This was no sooner known, than he left Dublin under the guard of the militia commanded by Lutterel, and with a reinforcement of six thousand infantry which he had lately received from France, joined the rest of his forces, which now almost equalled William's army in number, exclusive of about fif∣teen thousand men who remained in different garrisons. He occupied a very advantageous post on the bank of the Boyne, and contrary to the advice of his general officers, resolved to stand battle. They proposed to strengthen their garrisons, and retire to the Shannon, to wait the effect of the operations at sea. Lewis had promised to equip a powerful armament against the English fleet, and send over a great number of small frigates to destroy William's transports, as soon as their convoy should be returned to England. The execution of this scheme was not at all difficult, and must have proved fatal to the English army; for, their stores and ammunition were still on board; the ships sailed along the coast as the troops advanced in their march; and there was not one secure har∣bour into which they could retire on any emergency. James, however, was bent upon hazarding an engagement; and expressed uncommon confidence and alacrity. Besides the river, which was deep, his front was secured by a morass and a rising-ground: so that the English army could not attack him without manifest disadvantage.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>King William marched up to the opposite bank of the river, and as he reconnoitred their situation, was exposed to the fire of some field-pieces, which the enemy purposely planted against his person. They killed a man and two horses close by him; and the second bullet rebounding from the earth, grazed upon his right shoulder, so as to carry off part of his cloaths and skin, and produce a considerable contusion. This accident, which he bore without the least emotion, created some confusion among his attendants, which the enemy perceiving, concluded he was killed, and shouted aloud in token of their joy. Their whole camp resounded with acclamation; and several squadrons of their horse were drawn down towards the river, as if they had intended to pass it im∣mediately and attack the English army. The report was instantly communi∣cated from place to place, until it reached Dublin, from thence it was conveyed to Paris, where, contrary to the custom of the French court, the people were encouraged to celebrate the event with bonfires and illuminations. William rode along the line, to shew himself to the army after this narrow escape. At night he called a council of war; and declared his resolution to attack the enemy in the morning. Schomberg at first opposed this design; but finding the king determined, he advised that a strong detachment of horse and foot should that night pass the Boyne at Slane-bridge, and take post between the enemy and the pass of Duleck, that the action might be the more decisive. This counsel being rejected, the king determined that early in the morning, lieutenant-general Douglas, with the right wing of infantry, and young Schom∣berg, with the horse, should pass at Slane-bridge, while the main body of foot should force their passage at Old-bridge, and the left at certain fords between the enemy's camp and Drogheda. The duke perceiving his advice was not re∣lished by the Dutch generals, retired to his tent, where the order of battle being brought to him, he received it with an air of discontent, saying, it was the first that had ever been sent him in that manner. The proper dispositions being made, William rode quite through the army by torch-light, and then retired to
<PB N="48" REF="510"/>
his tent, after having given order for the soldiers to distinguish themselves from the enemy by wearing green boughs in their hats during the action.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>At six o'clock in the morning, general Douglas, with young Schom∣berg, the earl of Portland and Overkirk, marched towards Slane-bridge, and passed the river with very little opposition. When they reached the farther bank, they perceived the enemy drawn up in two lines, to a considerable number of horse and foot, with a morass in their front; so that Douglas was obliged to wait for a reinforcement. This being arrived, the infantry were led on to the charge through the morass, while count Schomberg rode round it with his cavalry, to attack the enemy in flank. The Irish, instead of waiting the assault, faced about and retreated towards Duleck with some precipitation; yet not so fast, but that Schomberg fell in among their rear, and did considerable execution. King James, however, soon reinforced his left wing from the center; and the count was in his turn obliged to send for assistance. At this juncture, king William's main body, consisting of the Dutch guards, the French regiments, and some battalions of English, passed the river, which was waist high, under a general discharge of artillery. King James had imprudently removed his cannon from the other side; but, he had posted a strong body of musqueteers along the bank, behind hedges, houses, and some works raised for the occasion. They poured in a close fire upon the English troops before they reached the shore; but it produced very little effect: then the Irish gave way; and some battalions landed without farther opposition. Yet, before they could form, they were charged with great impetuosity by a squadron of the enemy's horse; and a con∣siderable body of their cavalry and foot, commanded by general Hamilton, advanced from behind some little hillocks, to attack those that were landed, as well as to prevent the rest from reaching the shore. His infantry turned their backs and fled immediately; but, the horse charged with incredible sury, both upon the bank and in the river, so as to put the unformed regiments in confu∣sion. Then the duke of Schomberg passing the river in person, put himself at the head of the French protestants, and pointing to the enemy, <Q>“Gentlemen (said he) those are your persecutors;”</Q> with these words he advanced to the attack, where he himself sustained a violent onset from a party of the Irish horse which had broke through one of the regiments, and were now on their return. They were mistaken for English, and allowed to gallop up to the duke, who received two severe wounds in the head; but, the French regiments being now sensible of their mistake, rashly threw in their fire upon the Irish while they were engaged with the duke; and instead of saving, shot him dead upon the spot. The fate of this general had well nigh proved fatal to the English army, which was immediately involved in tumult and disorder; while the infantry of king James rallied and returned to their posts with a face of resolution. They were just ready to fall upon the center, when king William having passed with the left wing, composed of the Danish, Dutch, and Inniskillin horse, advanced to attack them on the right. They were struck with such a pannic at his appear∣ance, that they made a sudden halt, and then facing about, retreated to the vil∣lage of Dunore. There they made such a vigorous stand, that the Dutch and Danish horse, though headed by the king in person, recoiled. Even the Innis∣killiners gave way; and that whole wing would have been routed, had not a detachment of dragoons belonging to the regiments of Cunningham and Le∣vison,
<PB N="49" REF="520"/>
dismounted, and lined the hedges on each side of the defile through which the fugitives were driven. There they did such execution upon the pur∣suers as soon checked their ardour. The horse which were broken, had now time to rally, and returning to the charge, drove the enemy before them in their turn. In this action general Hamilton, who had been the life and soul of the Irish during the whole engagement, was wounded and taken; an inci∣dent which discouraged them to such a degree, that they made no further ef∣forts to retrieve the advantage they had lost. He was immediately brought to the king, who asked him if he thought the Irish would make any further re∣sistance? and he replied, <Q>“Upon my honour, I believe they will; for, they have still a good body of horse intire.”</Q> William eying him with a look of disdain, repeated "Your honour! your honour!" but took no other notice of his hav∣ing acted contrary to his engagement, when he was permitted to go to Ireland, on promise of persuading Tyrconnel to submit to the new government. The Irish now abandoned the field with precipitation; but, the French and Swiss troops that acted as their auxiliaries, under Lauzun, retreated in good order, after having maintained the battle for some time with intrepidity and perseve∣rance. As king William did not think proper to pursue the enemy, the car∣nage was not great.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Irish lost about fifteen hundred men, and the English about one third of that number; tho' the victory was dearly purchased, considering the death of the gallant duke of Schomberg, who fell in the eighty-second year of his age, after having rivalled the best generals of the age in military reputation. He was descended of a noble family in the Palatinate, and his mother was an Englishwoman, daughter of lord Dudley. Being obliged to leave his country on account of the troubles by which it was agitated, he commenced a soldier of fortune, and served successively in the armies of Holland, England, France, Portugal, and Brandenburgh. He attained to the dignities of marechal in France, grandee in Portugal, generalissimo in Prussia, and duke in England. He professed the protestant religion; was courteous and humble in his deport∣ment, cool, penetrating, resolute, and sagacious; nor was his probity inferior to his courage. This battle likewise proved fatal to the brave Caillemote, who had followed the duke's fortunes, and commanded one of the protestant regi∣ments. After having received a mortal wound, he was carried back through the river by four soldiers; and though almost in the agonies of death, he with a chearful countenance encouraged those who were crossing to do their duty, exclaiming, <Q>“A la gloire mes enfans; a la gloire! To glory, my lads; to glory!”</Q> The third remarkable person who lost his life on this occasion, was Walker the clergyman, who had so valiantly defended Londonderry against the whole army of king James. He had been very graciously received by king William, who gratified him with a reward of five thousand pounds, and a pro∣mise of further favour: but, his military genius still predominating, he attended his royal patron in this battle; and being shot in the belly, died in a few mi∣nutes. The persons of distinction who fell on the other side, were the lords Dongan and Carlingford, Sir Neile O Neile, and the marquis of Hocquincourt. James himself stood aloof during the action, on the hill of Dunmore, surrounded with some squadrons of horse; and seeing victory declare against him, retired to Dublin, without having made the least effort to reassemble his broken forces.

Next day he set out for Waterford, attended by the duke of Ber∣wick, Tyrconnel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the marquis of Powis. He ordered all the bridges to be broken down behind him; and embarked in a vessel which had been prepared for his reception.

The protestants imme∣diately took possession of the arms belonging to the militia, under the conduct of the bishops of Meath and Limerick. A committee was formed to take charge of the administration; and an account of these transactions was trans∣mitted to king William, together with a petition that he would honour the city with his presence.</P>

<P>On the morning after the battle of the Boyne, William sent a detachment of horse and foot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under the command of Mr. Melionere, to Droghe∣da, the governor of which surrendered the place without opposition. The king, at the head of the army, began his march for Dublin, and halted the first night at Bally<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Breghan, where having received advice of the enemy's retreat from the capital, he sent the duke of Ormond, with a body of horse, to take possession. These were immediately followed by the Dutch guards, who secured the castle. In a few days the king encamped at Finglas, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, where he was visited by the bishops of Meath and Limerick, at the head of the protestant clergy, whom he assured of his favour and protection. Then he pub∣lished a declaration of pardon to all the common people who had served against him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> provided they should return to their dwellings, and surrender their arms by the first day of August. Those that rented lands of popish proprietors who had been concerned in the rebe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, were required to retain their rents in their own hands, until they should have notice from the commissioners of the revenue, to whom they might be payed.

<P>During these transactions, the queen, as regent, found herself sur∣rounded with numberless cares and perplexities. Her council was pretty equally divided into Whigs and Tories, who did not always act with unanimity. She was distracted between her apprehensions for her father's safety and her hus∣band's life: she was threatened with an invasion by the French from abroad, and with an insurrection by the Jacobites at home. Nevertheless, she dis∣guised her fears, and behaved with equal prudence and fortitude. Advice be∣ing received that a fleet was ready to sail from Brest, lord Torrington hoisted his flag in the Downs, and sailed round to St. Helen's, in order to assemble such a number of ships as would enable him to give them battle. The enemy being discovered off Plymouth, on the twentieth day of June, the English admiral, reinforced with a Dutch squadron, put to sea with a view to intercept them at the back of the Isle of Wight, should they presume to sail up the channel. Not that he thought himself strong enough to cope with them in battle; for their fleet consisted of seventy-eight ships of war, and two and twenty fireships; whereas, the combined squadrons of England and Holland did not exceed six and fifty; but, he had received orders to hazard an engagement, if he thought it might be done with any prospect of success. After the hostile fleets had continued five days in sight of each other, lord Torrington bore down upon the enemy off Beachy-head, on the thirtieth day of June at day-break. The Dutch squadron which composed the van, began the engagement about nine in the morning; in about half an hour the blue division of the English were close en∣gaged with the rear of the French; but, the red, which formed the center, under the command of Torrington in person, did not fill the line till ten o'clock; so that the Dutch were almost surrounded by the enemy; and though they fought with great valour, sustained considerable damage. At length, the admiral's divi∣sion drove between them and the French; and in that situation the fleet an∣chored about five in the afternoon, when the action was interrupted by a calm. The Dutch had suffered so severely, that he thought it would be imprudent to renew the battle: he therefore weighed anchor in the night, and with the tide of f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ood retired to the eastward. The next day the disabled ships were destroyed, that they might not be retarded in their retreat. They were pursued as far as Rye; and an English ship of seventy guns being stranded near Winchelsea, was set on fire, and deserted, by the captain's command. A Dutch ship of sixty∣four guns met with the same accident, and some French frigates attempted to burn her; but, the captain defended her so vigorously, that they were obliged to d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he afterwards found means to carry her safe to Holland. In this engagement the English lost two ships, two sea-captains, and about four hundred men; but, the Dutch were more unfortunate. Six of their great ships were destroyed. Dick and Brackel rear-admirals, were slain, together with a gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at number of inferior officers and seamen. Torrington retreated without furt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er interruption into the mouth of the Thames; and having taken precau∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons against any attempts of the enemy in that quarter, returned to London, the inhabitants of which were overwhelmed with consternation.</P>

<P>The government was infected with the same panic. The minis∣try pretended to believe that the French acted in concert with the malecontents of the nasion; that insurrections in different parts of the kingdom had been projected by the Jacobites; and that there would be a general revolt in Scot∣land. These infinuations were circulated by the court-agents, in order to jus∣tify, in the opinion of the public, the measures that were deemed necessary at this juncture; and they produced the desired effect. The apprehensions, thus artfully raised among the people, inflamed their aversion to nonjurors and Jaco∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es. Addresses were presented to the queen, by the Cornish tinners, the lieu∣tenancy of Middlesex, and by the mayor, aldermen, and lieutenancy of Lon∣don, filled with professions of loyalty, and promises of supporting their majes∣ties as their lawful sovereigns, against all opposition. The queen, at this crisis, exhibited remarkable proofs of courage, activity, and discretion. She issued cut proper orders and directions for putting the nation in a posture of defence, as well as for refitting and augmenting the fleet: she took measures for appeas∣ing the resentment of the states-general, who exclaimed against the earl of Tor∣rington for his behaviour in the late action. He was deprived of his com∣mand, and sent prisoner to the Tower; and commissioners were appointed to exa∣mine the particular circumstances of his conduct. A camp was formed in the neighbourhood of Torbay, where the French seemed to threaten a descent. Their fleet, which lay at anchor in the bay, cannonaded a small village called Tingmouth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> About a thousand of their men landed without opposition, set fire to the place, and burned a few coasting vessels: then they reimbarked, and returned to Brest; so vain of this atchievement, that they published a pompous account of their invasion. Some of the Whig partisans published pamphlets, and diffused re∣ports, implying, that the suspended bishops were concerned in the conspiracy against the government; and these arts proved so inflammatory among the com∣mon people, that the prelates thought it necessary to print a paper, in which they asserted their innocence in the most solemn protestations. The court seems to have harboured no suspicion against them; otherwise they would not have es∣caped imprisonment, when the queen published a proclamation for apprehend∣ing the carls of Litchfield, Aylesbury, and Castlemain, viscount Preston, the lords Montgomery and Bella<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, Sir Edward Hales, Sir Robert Tharold, Sir Robert Hamilton, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, colonel Edward Sackville, and some other officers, accused of having conspired with other disaffected persons, to disturb and destroy the government; and of a design to concur with her majesty's enemies in the intended invasion. The earl of Torrington continued a prisoner in the Tower till next session, when he was brought into the house of commons; and made a speech in his own defence. His case produced long debates in the upper house, where the form of his commitment was judged illegal: at length, he was tried by a court-martial, appointed by the commissioners of the admiralty, though not before an act had passed, declaring the power of a lord high-admiral vested in those commissioners. The president of the court was Sir Ralph Delaval, who had acted as vice-admiral of the blue, in the engage∣ment. The earl was acquitted: but, the king dismissed him from the service; and the Dutch exclaimed against the partiality of his judges.</P>

<P>William is said to have taken all the papers of his father-in law and Tyrconnel, and to have learned from them, not only the design pro∣jected by the French to burn the English transports, but likewise the under∣taking of one Jones, who engaged to assassinate king William. No such at∣tempt, however, was made; and, in all probability, the whole report was a fiction, calculated to throw an odium on James's character. On the ninth day of July, William detached general Douglas with a considerable body of horse and foot towards Athlone; while he himself, having left Trelawny to command at Dublin, advanced with the rest of his army to Inchequin, in his way to Kil∣kenny. Colonel Grace, the governor of Athlone for king James, being summoned to surrender, fired a pistol at the trumpeter, saying, "These are my terms." Then Douglas resolved to undertake the siege of the place, which was natu∣rally very strong, and defended by a resolute garrison. An inconsiderable breach was made, when Douglas receiving intelligence that Sarsfield was on his march to the relief of the besieged, abandoned the enterprize, after having lost above four hundred men in the attempt. The king continued his march to the westward; and, by dint of severe examples, established such order and discipline in his army, that the peasants were secure from the least violence. At Carlow he detached the duke of Ormond to take possession of Kilkenny, where that nobleman regaled him in his own castle, which the enemy had left undamaged. While the army encamped at Carrick, major-general Kirke was sent to Waterford, the garrison of which, consisting of two regiments, capi∣tulated, upon condition of marching out with their arms and baggage, and being conducted to Mallow. The fort of Duncannon was surrendered on the same terms. Here the lord Dover and the lord George Howard were ad∣mitted to the benefit of the king's mercy and protection.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>On the first day of August, William being at Chapel-Izard, published a second declaration of mercy, confirming the former, and even ex∣tending it to persons of superior rank and station, whether natives or foreigners, provided they would, by the twenty-fifth day of the month, lay down their arms, and submit to certain conditions. This offer of indemnity produced very little effect; for the Irish were generally governed by their priests; and the news of the victory which the French fleet had obtained over the English and Dutch, were circulated with such exaggerations as elevated their spirits, and effaced all thoughts of submission. The king had returned to Dublin, with a view to embark of England; but receiving notice that the designs of his domestic enemies were discovered and frustrated, that the fleet was repaired, and the French navy retired to Brest, he postponed his voyage, and resolved to reduce Limerick, in which monsieur Boisseleau commanded as governor, and the duke of Berwick and colonel Sarsfield acted as inferior officers. On the ninth day of August, the king having called in his detachments, and ad∣vanced into the neighbourhood of the place, summoned the commander to de∣liver the town; and Boisseleau answered, that he imagined the best way to gain the good opinion of the prince of Orange, would be a vigorous defence of the town, which his majesty had committed to his charge. Before the place was fully invested, colonel Sarsfield, with a body of horse and dragoons, passed the Shannon in the night, intercepted the king's train of artillery on its way to the camp, routed the troops that guarded it, disabled the cannon, destroyed
<PB N="54" REF="570"/>
the carriages, waggons, and ammunition, and returned in safety to Limerick. Notwithstanding this disaster, the trenches were opened on the seventeenth day of the month, and a battery was raised with some cannon brought from Wa∣terford. The siege was carried on with vigour, and the place defended with great resolution. At length the king ordered his troops to make a lodgment in the covered way or counterscarp, which was accordingly assaulted with great fury: but the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ailants met with such a warm reception from the besieged, that they were repulsed with the loss of twelve hundred men, either killed on the spot or mortally wounded. This disappointment concurring with the badness of the weather, which became rainy and unwholsome, induced the king to renounce his undertaking. The heavy baggage and cannon being sent away, the army decampted and marched towards Clonmel. William having constituted the lord Sidney and Thomas Coningsby lords justices of Ireland, and left the command of the army with count Solmes, embarked at Duncanno<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with prince George of Denmark, on the fifth of September, and next day arrived in King's ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, near Bristol, from whence he r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ired to Wind<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or.</P>

<P>About the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter end of this month, the earl of Marlborough arrived in Ireland with five thousand English troops, to attack Cork and Kin∣sale, in conjunction with a detachment from the great army, according to a scheme he had proposed to king William. Having landed his soldiers, without much opposition in the neighbourhood of Cork, he was joined by five thousand men, under the prince of Wirtemberg, between whom and the earl a dispute arose about the command: but this was compromised by the interposition of L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mellionere. The place being i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>est<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, and the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tteries raised, the be∣siegers proceeded with such rapidity that a bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch was soon eff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted. Colonel Mackillicut the governor demanded a parley, and hostages were exchanged: but he rejected the conditions that were offered, and hostilities recommenced with redoubled vigour. The duke of Grafton, who served on this occasion as a volunteer, was mortally wounded in one of the attacks, and died regreted as a youth of promising talents. Preparations being made for a general assault, the besieged thought proper to capitulate, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Besides the governor and colonel Ricaut, the victor found the earls of Clan∣carty and Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one among the individuals of the garrison. Marlborough having taken po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ession of Cork, detached brigadier Villiers with a body of horse and dragoons to summon the town and forts of Kinsale; and next day advanced with the rest of the forces. The old fort was immediately taken by assault; but Sir Edward Scot, who commanded the other, sustained a regular siege, until the breach was practicable, and then obtained an honourable capitulation. These maritime places being reduced, all communication between France and the enemy, on this side of the island, was cut off, and the Irish were confined to Ulster, where they could not subsist without great difficulty. The earl of Marlborough having finished this expedition in thirty days, returned with his prisoners to England, where the same of this exploit added greatly to his re∣putation.</P>

<P>The affairs of the continent had not yet undergone any change of importance, except in the conduct of the duke of Savoy, who renounced his neutrality, engaged in an alliance with the emperor and king of Spain; and, in a word, acceded to the grand confederacy. He had no sooner declared himself, than Catinat the French general entered his territories at the head of eighteen thousand men, defeated him in a pitched battle near S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luces, which immediately surrendered to the conqueror. Then he reduced Savillana, Villa Franca, with several other places, pursued the duke to Carignan, surprised Suza, and distributed his forces in winter-quarters, partly in Provence, and partly in the dutchy of Savoy, which St. Ruth had lately reduced under the dominion of France. The duke finding himself disappointed in the succours he expected from the emperor and king of Spain, demanded assistance of the states-general and king William, to whom he sent an ambassador to congra∣culate him upon his accession to the throne of England. The confederates, in their general congress at the Hague, had agreed that the army of the states under prince Waldeck should oppose the forces of France, com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the duke of Luxemburg in Flanders; while the elector of Brandenburg should observe the marquis de Boufflers on the Moselle: but, before the troops of Brandenburg could be assembled, Boufflers encamped between the Sambre and the Meuse, and maintained a free communication with Luxemburg.</P>

He was encountered by the French army near Flerus, and slain; and his troops, though supported by two other detachments, were hardly able to rejoin the main body, which continued all night in order of battle. Next day they were attacked by the French, who were greatly superior to them in number; and, after a very obstinate engagement, obliged to give way, leaving about five thousand men dead upon the field of battle. The enemy took about four thousand prisoners, and the greatest part of their artillery; but the victory was dearly bought. The Dutch infantry fought with surprising resolution and success. The duke of Luxemburg owned, with surprise, that they had surpassed the Spanish foot at the battle of Rocroy. <Q>“Prince Waldeck (said he) ought always to remember the French horse; and I shall never forget the Dutch infantry.”</Q> The Dutch general exerted himself

<P>King William having published a proclamation, requiring the at∣tendance of the members on the second day of October, both houses met ac∣cordingly, and he opened the session with a speech to the usual purport. He mentioned what he had done towards the reduction of Ireland; commended the behaviour of the troops<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told them the supplies were not equal to the ne∣cessary expence; represented the danger to which the nation would be exposed, unless the war should be prosecuted with vigour; conjured them to clear his revenue, which was mortgaged for the payment of former debts, and enable him to pay off the arrears of the army; assured them that the success of the confederacy abroad would depend upon the vigour and dispatch of their pro∣ceedings; expressed his resentment against those who had been guilty of mis∣conduct in the management of the fleet; recommended unanimity and expedi∣tion, and declared, that whoever should attempt to divert their attention from those subjects of importance which he had proposed, could neither be a friend to him, nor a wellwisher to his country. The late attempt of the French upon the coast of England, the rumours of a conspiracy by the Jacobites, the per∣sonal<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> valour which William had displayed in Ireland, and the pusillanimous behaviour of James, concurred in warming the resentment of the nation against the adherents of the late king, and in raising a tide of loyalty in favour of the new government. Both houses presented separate addresses of con∣gratulation to the king and queen, upon his courage and conduct in the field, and her fortitude and sagacity at the helm, in times of danger and disquiet. The commons, pursuant to an estimate laid before them of the next year's ex∣pences, voted a supply of four millions for the maintenance of the army and navy, and settled the funds for that purpose.</P>

<P>They proposed to raise one million by the sale of forfeited estates in Ireland: they resolved, that a bill should be brought in for confiscating those estates, with a clause, impowering the king to bestow a third part of them on those who had served in the war, as well as to grant such articles and capitula∣tions to those who were in arms, as he should think proper. This clause was rejected; and a great number of petitions were offered against the bill, by cre∣ditors and heirs, who had continued faithful to the government. These were supposed to have been suggested by the court, in order to retard the progress of the bill; for the estates had been already promised to the king's favourites: nevertheless, the bill passed the lower house, and was sent up to the lords, among whom it was purposely delayed by the influence of the ministry. It was at this juncture that lord Torrington was tried and acquitted, very much to the dissatisfaction of the king, who not only dismissed him from the service, but even forbade him to appear in his presence. When William came to the house of lords, to give the royal assent to a bill for doubling the excise, he told the parlia∣ment, that the posture of affairs required his presence at the Hague; that therefore, they ought to lose no time in perfecting such other supplies as were still necessary for the maintenance of the army and navy; and he reminded them of making some provision for the expence of the civil government.

bills were accordingly passed for granting to their majesties the duties on goods imported for five years; and these, together with t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e mutiny-bill, received the royal assent: upon which occasion the king observed, that if some annual pro∣vision could be made for augmenting the navy, it would greatly conduce to the honour and safety of the nation.

Pilkington and his associates undertook to prove, that those allegations were either false or frivolous; and represented the petition as a contrivance of the Jacobites, to disturb the peace of the city, that the supply might be re∣tarded, and the government distressed. In the late panic which overspread the nation, the Whigs had appeared to be the monied men, and subscribed largely for the security of the settlement they had made, while the Tories kept aloof with a suspicious caution.

A committee of lords was appointed to examine precedents, and enquire whether impeachments con∣tinued in statu quo from parliament to parliament.

Next day, being informed by a fisherman, that he was with∣in a league and a half of Goree, he quitted the yacht, and went into an open boat, attended by the duke of Ormond, the earls of Devonshire, Dorset, Port∣land, and Monmouth, with Overkirke, and Zuylestein. Instead of landing im∣mediately, they lost sight of the fleet, and night coming on, were exposed in very severe weather to the danger of the enemy and the sea, which ran very high for eighteen hours, during which the king and all his attendants were drenched with sea-water. When the sailors expressed their apprehensions of perishing, the king asked, if they were afraid to die in his company? At day-break he landed on the isle of Goree, where he took some refreshment in a fisherman's hut; then he committed himself to the boat again, and was conveyed to the shore in the neighbourhood of Maeslandsluys. A deputation of the states re∣ceived him at Hounslardyke; and about six in the evening he arrived at the Hague, where he was immediately complimented by the states-general, the states of Holland, the council of state, the other colleges, and the foreign mi∣nisters.

twenty-two thousand men against France in the ensuing campaign. The pro∣portions of the different princes and states were regulated; and the king of England agreed to furnish twenty thousand. He supplied the duke of Savoy so liberally, that his affairs soon assumed a more promising aspect. The plan of operations was settled; and they transacted their affairs with such harmony, that no dispute interrupted their deliberations. In the beginning of March, imme∣diately after the congress broke up, the siege of Mons was undertaken by the French king in person, accompanied by the dauphin, the dukes of Orleans and Chartres. The garrison consisted of about six thousand men, commanded by the prince of Bergue; but, the besiegers carried on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>their works with such rapi∣dity as they could not withstand. King William no sooner understood that the place was invested, than he ordered prince Waldeck to assemble the army, determined to march against the enemy in person. Fifty thousand men were soon collected at Halle near Brussels; but, when he went thither, he found the Spaniards had neglected to provide carriages and other necessaries for the expe∣dition. Mean while, the burghers of Mons seeing their town in danger of being utterly destroyed by the bombs and cannon of the enemy, pressed the governor to capitulate, and even threatened to introduce the besiegers: so that he was forced to comply, and obtained very honourable conditions. William being apprized of this event, returned to the Hague, embarked for England, and arrived at Whitehall on the thirteenth day of April <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few days before his arrival, great part of the palace of Whitehall was consumed by fire, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the negligence of a female servant.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>A Conspiracy against the government had been lately discovered. In the latter end of December, the master of a vessel who lived at Bark∣ing in Essex, informed the marquis of Carmaerthen, that his wife had let out one of his barks to carry over some persons to France; and that they would embark on the thirtieth day of the month. This intelligence being communi∣cated to the king and council, an order was sent to captain Billop, to watch the motion of the vessel and secure the passengers. He accordingly boarded her at Gravesend, and found in the hold lord Preston, Mr. Ashton, a servant of the late queen, and one Elliot. He likewise seized a bundle of papers, some of which were scarce intelligible; and among the rest, two letters supposed to be written by Turner bishop of Ely to king James and his queen, under fictitious names. The whole amounted to an invitation to the French king, to assist king James in reascending the throne, upon certain conditions, while William should be absent from the kingdom: but the scheme was ill layed, and countenanced but by a very few persons of consideration<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> among whom the chiefs were the earl of Clarendon, the bishop of Ely, lord Preston, his brother Mr. Graham, and Penn the famous quaker. Notwithstanding the outcries which had been made against the severities of the late government, Preston and his accomplice
<PB N="62" REF="650" MS="y"/>
Ashton, were tried at the Old Bailey for compassing the death of their majesties king William and queen Mary; and their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>als were hurried on without any regard to their petitions for delay. Lord Preston alledged, in his defence, that the treasons charged upon him were not committed in the county of Middlesex, as laid in the indictment; that none of the witnesses declared he had any con∣cern in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iring the vessel; that the papers were not found upon him; that there ought to be two credible witnesses to every fact, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas the whole proof against him rested on similitude of hands and m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>pposition. He was nevertheless <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound guilty. Ashton behaved with great i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>repidity and composure. He owned his purpose of going to France, in purs<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ance of a promise he had made to general Worden, who, on his de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th-b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>jured him to go thither and finish some affairs of con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>quence which he had le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t there depending; and with a view to recover a considerable sum of money due to himself. He denied that he was privy to the contents of the papers <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound upon him; he complained of his having been denied time to prepare for his trial; and called several persons to prove him a protestant of exemplary piety and irreproachable morals. These circumstances had no weight with the court. He was brow-beaten by the bench, and found guilty by the jury, as he had the papers in his custody: yet there was no privity proved; and the Whig party themselves had often expresly de∣clared, that of all sorts of evidence, that of finding papers in a person's pos∣session is the weakest, because no man can secure himself from such danger. Ash<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suffered with equal courage and decorum. In a paper which he de∣livered to the sheriff, he owned his attachment to king James; he witnessed to the birth of the prince of Wales; denied his knowledge of the contents of the papers that were committed to his charge; complaine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the hard measure he had met with from the judges and the jury, but forgave them in the sight of heaven. This man was celebrated by the No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>urors as a martyr to loyalty; and they boldly affirmed, that his chief crime in the eyes of the government,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Barne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

Lord Preston obtained a pardon; Elliot was not tried, because no evidence appeared against him; the earl of Clarendon was sent to the Tower, where he remained some months, and he was afterwards confined to his own house in the country: an indulgence which he owed to his consanguinity with the queen, who was his first cousin. The bishop of Ely, Graham, and Penn absconded; and a proclama∣tion was issued for apprehending them as traitors.</P>

<P>This prelate's being concerned in a conspiracy, furnished the king with a plausible pretence for filling up the vacant bishoprics. The deprived bishops had been given to understand, that an act of parliament might be obtained to excuse them from taking the oaths, provided they would perform their episco∣pal functions; but, as they declined this expedient, the king resolved to fill up
<PB N="63" REF="660"/>
their places at his return from Holland. Accordingly the archbishopric of<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1691.</NOTE> Canterbury was conferred upon doctor Tillotson <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Beveridge was promoted to the see of Bath and Wells, Fowler to that of Glouce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, Cum∣berland to Peterborough, M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore to Norwich, Grove to Chichester, and Patrick to fly.</NOTE>, one of the most learned, moderate, and virtuous ecclesiastics of the age, who did not accept of this pro∣motion without great reluctance, because he foresaw that he should be exposed to the slander and malevolence of that party which espoused the cause of his predecessor. The other vacant sees were given to divines of unblemished cha∣racter; and the public in general seemed very well satisfied with this e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ertion of the king's supremacy. The deprived bishops at first affected all the meekness of resignation. They remembered those shouts of popular approbation, by which they had been animated in the pers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cution they suffered under the late government; and they hoped the same cordial would support them in their pre∣sent affliction: but, finding the nation cold in their concern, they deter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to warm it by argument and declamation. The press groaned with the efforts of their learning and resentment; and every essay was answered by their oppo∣nents. The Nonjurors affirmed that Christianity was a doctrine of the cross; that no pretence whatever could justify an insurrection against the sovereign; that the primitive christians thought it their indispensible duty so be passive under every invasion of their rights; that non-resistance was the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctrine of the English church, confirmed by all the sanctions that could be derived from the laws of God and man. The other party not only supported the natural righ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of mankind, and explained the use that might be made of the doctrine of non∣r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sistance, in exciting fresh commotions, but they also argued, that if pass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve obedience was right in any instance, it was conclusively so with regard to the present government; for the obedience required by scripture was indiscri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inate, <Q>“the powers that be, are ordained of God—let every soul be subject to the higher powers.”</Q> From these texts they inferred, that the new o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ths ought to be taken without scruple; and that those who refused them, con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>aled party under the cloak of conscience. On the other hand, the fallacy and treachery of this argument were demonstrated. They said it levelled all distinctions of j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tice and duty; that those who taught such doctrines attached themselves so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely to possession, howsoever unjustly acquired; that if twenty different usurpers should succeed one another, they would recognize the last, notwithstanding the allegiance they had so solemnly sworn to his predecessor, like the sawning spaniel that followed the thief who mounted his master's horse, after having murdered the right owner. They also denied the justice of a lay-deprivation, and with respect to church-government started the same di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inction<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <Q>“De ju<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and De facto,”</Q> which they had formerly made in the civil administration. They had even recourse to all the bitterness of invective against Tillotson and the new bishops, whom they reviled as intruders and usurpers; but their acrim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny was chiefly directed against Dr. Sherlock, who had been one of the most violent sticklers against the revolution, but thought proper to take the oaths upon the retreat of king James from Ireland. They branded him as an apo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate who had betrayed his cause, and published a review of his whole conduct, which proved a severe satire upon his character. Their attacks upon individuals were mingled with their vengeance against the government: and indeed the great aim of their divines as well as of their politicians, was to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ap the foundation of
<PB N="64" REF="670"/>

<P>The presbyterians in Scotland acted with such folly, violence, and ty∣ranny, as rendered them equally odious and contemptible. The transactions in their general assembly were carried on with such peevishness, partiality, and injustice, that the king dissolved it by an act of state, and convoked another for the month of November in the following year. The episcopal party promised to enter heartily into the interests of the new government, to keep the Highland∣ers quiet, and induce the clergy to acknowledge and serve king William, pro∣vided he would ballance the power of Melvill and his partisans in such a manner as would secure them from violence and oppression; provided the episcopal ministers should be permitted to perform their functions among those people by whom they were beloved; and that such of them as were willing to mix with the presbyterians in their judicatories, should be admitted without any severe imposition in point of opinion. The king, who was extremely disgusted at the presbyterians, relished the proposal; and young Dalrymple, son of lord Stair, was appointed joint secretary of state with Melvill. He undertook to bring over the majority of the Jacobites<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and a great number of them took the oaths; but at the same time they maintained a correspondence with the court of St. Ger∣mains, by the connivance of which they submitted to William, that they might be in a condition to serve James the more effectually. The Scottish par∣liament was adjourned by proclamation to the sixteenth day of September. Precautions were taken to prevent any dangerous communication with the con∣tinent; a committee was appointed to put the kingdom in a posture of defence; to exercise the powers of the regency, in securing the enemies of the govern∣ment: and the earl of Home<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with Sir Peter Fraser and Sir Aeneas Macpher∣son<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was apprehended and imprisoned.</P>

<P>The king having settled the operations of the ensuing campaign in Ireland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where general G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ckle exercised the supreme command, manned his fleet by dint of pressing sailors<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the incredible annoyance of commerce, left the queen as before at the helm of government in England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> returned to Holland, accompanied by lord Sidney secretary of state, the earls of Marl∣borough and Portland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and began to make preparations for taking the field in person. On the thirt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth day of May, the duke of Luxemburg having passed the Scheld at the head of a large army, took possession of Halle, and gave it up to plunder, in sight of the confederates, who were obliged to throw up in∣trenchments for their preservation. At the same time the marquis de Boufflers, with a considerable body of forces, intrenched himself before Liege, with a view
<PB N="65" REF="680"/>
to bombard that city. In the beginning of June, king William took upon him∣self the command of the allied army, by this time reinforced in such a manner as to be superior to the enemy. He forthwith detached the count de Tilly with ten thousand men to the relief of Liege, which was already reduced to ruins and desolation by the bombs, bullets, and repeated attacks of Boufflers, who now thought proper to retreat to Dinant. Tilly having thus raised the siege and thrown a body of troops into Huy, rejoined the confederate army, which had been augmented even since his departure with six thousand men from Branden∣burg, and ten thousand Hessians, commanded by the landgrave in person. Such was the vigilance of Luxemburg, that William could not avail himself of his superiority. In vain he exhausted his invention in marches, countermarches, and stratagems, to bring on a general engagement: the French marshal avoided it with such dexterity as baffled all his endeavours. In the course of this campaign, the two armies twice confronted each other; but they were situated in such a man∣ner that neither could begin the attack without a manifest disadvantage. While the king lay encamped at Court-sur-heure, a soldier, corrupted by the enemy, set fire to the fuses of several bombs, the explosion of which might have blown up the whole magazine, and produced infinite confusion in the army, had not the mischief been prevented by the courage of the men that guarded the artillery: even while the fuses were burning they disengaged the waggons from the line, and overturned them down the side of a hill; so that the communication of the fire was intercepted. The person who made this treacherous attempt being discovered, owned he had been employed for this purpose by the duke of Lux∣emburg. He was tried by a court-martial, and suffered the death of a traitor. King William quitting Court-sur-heure, encamped upon the plain of St. Girard, where he remained till the fourth day of September, consuming the forage and exhausting the country. Then he passed the Sambre near Jemeppe, while the French crossed it at La Busierre, and both armies marched towards Enghien. The enemy perceiving the confederates were at their heels, proceeded to Gra∣mont, passed the Dender, and took possession of a strong camp between Aeth and Oudenarde; William followed the same route, and encamped between Aeth and Leuse. While he continued in this post, the Hessian forces and those of Liege, amounting to about eighteen thousand men, separated from the army and passed the Meuse at Namur; then the king returned to the Hague, leaving the command to prince Waldeck, who forthwith removed to Leuse, and on the twentieth day of the month began his march to Cambron. Luxemburg, who watched his motions with a curious eye, found means to attack him in his retreat so suddenly, that his rear was surprised and defeated, though the French were at last obliged to retire: the prince continued his route to Cambron, and in a little time both armies retired into winter-quarters. In the mean time, the duke de Noailles besieged and took Urgel in Catalonia, while a French squadron, commanded by the count D'Etrees, bombarded Barcelona and Alicant.</P>

<P>The confederates had proposed to act vigorously in Italy against the French; but the season was far advanced before they were in a condition to take the field. The emperor and Spain had undertaken to furnish troops to join the duke of Savoy, and the maritime powers contributed their proportion in money. The elector of Bavaria was nominated to the supreme command of
<PB N="6$" REF="690"/>
the imperial forces in that country; the marquis de Leganez, governor of the Milanese, acted as trustee for the Spanish monarch; duke Schomberg, lately created duke of Leinster, managed the interest of William as king of England and stadtholder, and commanded a body of the Vaudois payed by Great Britain. Before the German auxiliaries arrived, the French had made great progress in their conquests. Catinat made himself master of Villa-Franca, Nice, and some other fortifications; then he reduced Villana and Carmagnola, and detached the mar∣quis de Feuquieres to invest Coni, a strong fortress garrisoned by the Vaudois and French refugees. The duke of Savoy was now reduced to the brink of ruin. He saw almost all his places of strength in the possession of the enemy: Coni was besieged; and la Hoguette, another French general, had forced the passes of the valley of Aoste; so that he had free admission into the Verceillois and the frontiers of the Milanese. Turin was threatened with a bombardment; the people were dispirited and clamorous; and their sovereign lay with his little army encamped on the hill of Montcallier, from whence he beheld his towns taken and his palace of Rivoli destroyed. Duke Schomberg exhorted him to act on the offensive, and give battle to Catinat, while that officer's army was weakened by detachments; and prince Eugene supported his remonstrance: but this proposal was vehemently opposed by the marquis de Leganez, who foresaw that if the duke should be defeated, the French would penetrate into the territories of Milan. The relief of Coni, however, was undertaken by prince Eugene, who began his march for that place with a convoy guarded by two and twenty hundred horse: at Magliano he was reinforced by five thousand militia; and Bulonde, who commanded at the siege, no sooner heard of his ap∣proach than he retired with the utmost precipitation, leaving behind some pieces of cannon, mortars, bombs, arms, ammunition, tents, provisions, utensils, with all his sick and wounded. When he joined Catinat, he was immediately put under arrest, and afterwards cashiered with disgrace. Hoguette aban∣doned the valley of Aoste; Feuquieres was sent with a detachment to change the garrison of Casal, and Catinat retired with his army towards Villa Nova d'Aste.</P>

<P>The miscarriage of the French before Coni affected Louvois the minister of Lewis so deeply, that he could not help shedding tears when he communicated the event to his master, who told him, with great composure, that he was spoiled by good fortune. But the retreat of the French from Piedmont had a still greater influence over the resolutions of the conclave at Rome, then sitting for the election of a new pope in the room of Alexander VIII. who died in the beginning of February. Notwithstanding the power and intrigues of the French faction, headed by the cardinal D'Etrees, the affairs of Piedmont had no sooner taken this turn, than the Italians joined the Spanish and impe∣rial interest, and cardinal Pignatelli, a Neapolitan, was elected pontiff. He as∣sumed the name of Innocent, in honour of the last pope known by that appel∣lation, and adopted all his maxims against the French monarch. When the German auxiliaries arrived, under the command of the elector of Bavaria, the confederates resolved to give battle to Catinat; but he repassed the Po, and sent couriers to Versailles to sollicit a reinforcement. Then prince Eugene invested Carmagnola, and carried on the siege with such vigour, that in eleven days the garrison capitulated. Mean while the marquis de Hoquincourt undertook the
<PB N="$7" REF="700"/>
conquest of Montmelian, and reduced the town without much resistance. The castle, however, made such a vigorous defence, that Catinat marched thither in person; and, notwithstanding all his efforts, the place held out till the second day of December, when it surrendered on honourable con∣ditions.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>This summer produced nothing of importance on the Rhine. The French endeavoured to surprise Mentz, by maintaining a correspondence with one of the emperor's commissioners; but this being discovered, their design was frustrated. The imperial army, under the elector of Saxony, passed the Rhine in the neighbourhood of Manheim; and the French crossing the same river at Philipsburg, reduced the town of Portzheim in the marquisate of Baden-Dour∣lach. The execution of the scheme, projected by the emperor for this cam∣paign, was prevented by the death of his general the elector of Saxony, which happened on the second day of September. His affairs wore a more favourable aspect in Hungary, where the Turks were totally defeated by prince Lewis of Baden on the banks of the Danube. The Imperialists afterwards undertook the siege of Great Waradin in Transylvania; but this was turned into a blockade, and the place was not surrendered till the following spring. The Turks were so dispirited by the defeat, by which they had lost the grand vizir, that the emperor might have made peace upon very advantageous terms: but his pride and ambition overshot his success. He was weak, insolent, and superstitious; he imagined that now the war of Ireland was almost extinguished, king Wil∣liam, with the rest of the allies, would be able to humble the French power, though he himself should not co-operate with heretics, whom he abhorred; and that, in the mean time, he should not only make an entire conquest of Tran∣sylvania, but also carry his victorious arms to the gates of Constantinople, ac∣cording to some ridiculous prophecy by which his vanity had been flattered. The Spanish government was become so feeble, that, rather than be at the ex∣pence of defending the Netherlands, it offered to deliver the whole country to king William, either as monarch of England or stadtholder of the United Pro∣vinces. He declined this offer, because he knew the people would never be re∣conciled to a protestant government: but he proposed that the Spaniards should confer the administration of Flanders upon the elector of Bavaria, who was am∣bitious of signalizing his courage, and able to defend the country with his own troops and treasure. This proposal was relished by the court of Spain: the emperor imparted it to the elector, who accepted the office without hesitation; and he was immediately declared governor of the Low-Countries by the council of state at Madrid. King William, after his return from the army, continued some time at the Hague, settling the operations of the ensuing campaign; and embarking in the Maese, landed in England on the nineteenth day of October.</P>

<P>Before we explain the proceedings in parliament, it will be necessary to give a detail of the late transactions in Ireland. In the beginning of the season the French king had sent a large supply of provision, cloaths, and ammu∣nition, for the use of the Irish at Limerick, under the conduct of monsieur St. Ruth, accompanied by a good number of French officers, furnished with com∣missions from king James, though St. Ruth issued all his orders in the name of Lewis. Tyrconnel had arrived in January with three frigates and nine vessels, loaded with succours of the same nature; otherwise the Irish could not
<PB N="68" REF="710"/>
have been so long kept together. Nor indeed could these supplies prevent them from forming separate and independent bands of Rapparees, who plundered the country, and committed the most shocking barbarities. The lords justices, in conjunction with general Ginckle, had taken every step their prudence could sug∣gest, to quiet the disturbances of the country, and prevent such violence and rapine, of which the soldiers in king William's army were not intirely innocent. The justices had issued proclamations, denouncing severe penalties against those who should countenance or conceal such acts of cruelty and oppression: they pro∣mised to protect all papists who should live quietly within a certain frontier line; and Ginckle gave the catholic rebels to understand, that he was authorized to treat with them, if they were inclined to return to their duty. Before the armies took the field, several skirmishes had been fought between parties; and these had always turned out so unfortunate to the enemy, that their spirits were quite depressed, while the confidence of the English rose in the same proportion.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>St. Ruth and Tyrconnel were joined by the Rapparees, and general Ginckle was reinforced by Mackay, with those troops which had reduced the Highlanders in Scotland. He, in the beginning of June, marched from Mul∣lingar to Ballymore, which was garrisoned by a thousand men under colonel Bourke, who, when summoned to surrender, returned an evasive answer. But, when a breach was made in the place, and the besiegers began to make prepa∣rations for a general assault, his men layed down their arms<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and submitted at discretion. The fortifications of this place being repaired and augmented, the general left a garrison for its defence, and advanced to Athlone, situated on the other side of the Shannon, and supported by the Irish army encamped almost under its walls. The English town, on the hither side of the river, was taken sword in hand; and the enemy broke down an arch of the bridge in their re∣treat. Batteries were raised against the Irish town; and several unsuccessful attempts were made to force the passage of the bridge, which was defended with great vigour. At length, it was resolved, in a council of war, that a detach∣ment should pass at a ford a little to the left of the bridge, though the river was deep and rapid, the bottom foul and stony, and the pass guarded by a bas∣tion erected for that purpose. The forlorn hope consisted of sixty grenadiers in armour, headed by captain Sandys, and two lieutenants. They were seconded by another detachment, and this was supported by six battalions of infantry. Never was a more desperate service, nor was ever exploit performed with more valour and intrepidity. They passed twenty a-breast, in the face of the enemy, through an incessant shower of balls, bullets, and grenades. Those who followed them took possession of the bridge, and laid planks over the broken arch. Pontoons were fixed at the same time, that the troops might pass in different places. The Irish were amazed, confounded, and abandoned the town in the utmost conster∣nation; so that, in half an hour, it was wholly secured by the English, who did not lose above fifty men in this attack. Mackay, Tetteau, and Talmash, exhibited proofs of the most undaunted courage in passing the river; and general Ginckle, for his conduct, intrepidity, and success on this occasion, was created earl of Athlone. When St. Ruth was informed by express, that the English had entered the river, he said, it was impossible they should pretend to take a town which he covered with his army; and that he would give a thou∣sand pistoles they would attempt to force a passage. Sarsfield insisted upon the
<PB N="69" REF="720"/>
truth of the intelligence, and pressed him to send succours to the town: he ridiculed this officer's fears, and some warm expostulation passed between them. Being at length convinced that the English were in possession of the place, he ordered some detachments to drive them out again; but, the cannon of their own works being turned against them, they found the task impracticable; and that very night their army decamped. St. Ruth, after a march of ten miles, took post at Aghrim, and having by draughts from garrisons, augmented his army to five and twenty thousand men, resolved to hazard a decisive en∣gagement.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Ginckle having put Athlone in a posture of defence, passed the Shannon, and marched up to the enemy, determined to give them battle, though his forces did not exceed eighteen thousand; and the Irish were posted in a very advan∣tageous situation. St. Ruth had made an admirable disposition, and taken every precaution that military skill could suggest. His center extended along a rising-ground, uneven in many places, intersected with banks and ditches, joined by lines of communication, and fronted by a large bog almost impassable. His right was fortified with intrenchments, and his left secured by the castle of Agh∣rim. He harangued his army in the most pathetic strain, conjuring them to exert their courage in defence of their holy religion, in the extirpation of heresy, in recovering their antient honours and estates, and in restoring a pious king to the throne, from whence he had been expelled by an unnatural usurper. He em∣ployed the priests to enforce his exhortations, to assure the men that they might depend upon the prayers of the church; and that, in case they should fall in battle, the saints and angels would convey their souls to heaven. They are said to have sworn upon the sacrament, that they would not desert their colours, and to have received an order that no quarter should be given to the French heretics in the army of the prince of Orange. Ginckle had encamped on the Roscom∣mon side of the river Suc, within three miles of the enemy; and, after having reconnoitred their posture, resolved, with the advice of a council of war, to at∣tack them on Sunday the twelfth day of July. The necessary orders being given, the army passed the river at two fords and a stone-bridge, and advancing to the edge of the great bog, began about twelve o'clock to force the two pas∣sages, in order to possess the ground on the other side. The enemy fought with surprising fury, and the horse were several times repulsed; but, at length, the troops upon the right carried their point by means of some field-pieces. The day was now so far advanced, that the general determined to postpone the battle till next morning; but, perceiving some disorder among the enemy, and fearing they would decamp in the night, he altered his resolution, and ordered the attack to be renewed. At six o'clock in the evening, the left wing of the English ad∣vanced to the right of the Irish, from whom they met with such a warm and obstinate reception, that it was not without the most surprising efforts of courage and perseverance, that they at length obliged them to give ground; and even that they lost by inches. St. Ruth seeing them in danger of being overpowered, immediately detached succours to them from his center and left wing. Mackay no sooner perceived them weakened by these detachments, than he ordered three battalions to skirt the bog, and attack them on the left, while the center advanced through the middle of the morass, the men wading up to the waste in mud and water. After they had reached the other side, they found themselves obliged
<PB N="70" REF="730"/>
to ascend a rugged hill, fenced with hedges and ditches; and these were lined with mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>queteers, supported at proper intervals with squadrons of cavalry. They made such a desperate resistance, and fought with such impetuosity, that the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ailants were repulsed into the middle of the bog with great loss; and St. Ruth exclaimed, "Now will I drive the English to the gates of Dublin." In this critical conjuncture, Talmash came up with a fresh body to sustain them, ral∣lied the broken troops, and renewed the charge with such vigour, that the Irish gave way in their turn, and the English recovered the ground they had lost, though they found it impossible to improve their advantage. Mackay brought a body of horse and dragoons to the assistance of the left wing; and first turned the tide of battle in favour of the English. Major<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>general Rouvigny, who had behaved with great gallantry during the whole action, advanced with five regiments of cavalry to support the center, when St. Ruth perceiving his de∣sign, resolved to fall upon him in a dangerous hollow way, which he was obliged to pass. For this purpose he began to descend Kircommodon-hill with his whole reserve of horse; but, in his way was killed by a cannon-ball. His troops immediately halted; and his guards retreated with his body. His fate dispirited the troops, and produced such confusion as Sarsfield could not remedy; for though he was next in command, he had been at variance with St. Ruth since the affair at Athlone, and was ignorant of the plan he had concerted. Rou∣vigny having passed the hollow way without opposition, charged the enemy in flank; and bore down all before him with surprising impetuosity: the center redoubled their efforts, and pushed the Irish to the top of the hill; and then their whole line giving way at once from right to left, threw down their arms. The foot fled towards a bog in their rear, and their horse took the route by the highway to Loughneagh: both were pursued by the English cavalry, who for four miles made a terrible slaughter. In the battle, which lasted two hours, and pursuit, above four thousand of the enemy were slain, and six hundred taken, together with all their baggage, tents, provision, ammunition, and artillery, nine and twenty pair of colours, twelve standards, and almost all the arms of the in∣fantry. In a word, the victory was decisive; and not above eight hundred of the English were killed upon the field of battle. The vanquished retreated in great confusion to Limerick, where they resolved to make a final stand, in hope of receiving such succours from France as would either enable them to retrieve their affairs, or obtain good terms from the court of England. There Tyrcon∣nel died of a broken heart, after having survived his authority and reputation, and incurred the contempt of the French, as well as the hatred of the Irish, whom he had advised to submit to the new government, rather than totally ruin them∣selves and their families.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI</HEAD>
<P>Immediately after the battle, detachments were sent to reduce Por∣tumny, Bonnachar, and Moor-castle, considerable passes on the Shannon, which were accordingly secured. Then Ginckle advanced to Galway, which he sum∣moned to surrender; but, he received a defiance from lord Dillon and general D'Ussone, who commanded the garrison. The trenches were immediately opened; a fort which commanded the approaches to the town, was taken by assault; six regiments of foot, and four squadrons of horse, passed the river on pontoons; and the place being wholly invested, the governor thought proper to capitulate. The garrison marched out with the honours of war, and was allowd
<PB N="71" REF="740"/>
safe-conduct to Limerick. Ginckle directed his march to the same town, which was the only post of consequence that now held out for king James. Within four miles of the place he halted, until the heavy cannon could be brought from Athlone. Hearing that Lutterel had been seized by the French general D'Us∣sone, and sentenced to be shot for having proposed to surrender, he sent a trum∣pet to tell the commander, that if any person should be put to death for such a proposal, he would make retaliation on the Irish prisoners. On the twenty∣fifth day of August, the enemy were driven from all their advanced posts: cap∣tain Cole, with a squadron of ships, sailed up the Shannon, and his frigates an∣chored in sight of the town. On the twenty-sixth day of the month the batte∣ries were opened, and a line of contravallation was formed: while the Irish army lay encamped on the other side of the river on the road to Killalow, and the fords were guarded with four regiments of their dragoons. On the fifth day of Sep∣tember, after the town had been almost laid in ruins by the bombs, and large breaches made in the walls by the battering cannon; the guns were dismounted, the out-forts evacuated, and such other motions made as indicated a resolution to abandon the siege. The enemy expressed their joy in loud acclamations; but this was of short continuance. In the night the besiegers began to throw a bridge of pontoons over the river, about a mile higher up than the camp; and this work was finished before morning. A considerable body of horse and foot had passed when the alarm was given to the enemy, who were seized with such consternation, that they threw down their arms and betook themselves to flight, leaving behind them their tents, baggage, two pieces of cannon, and one stand∣ard. The bridge was immediately removed nearer the town, and fortified; all the fords and passes were secured; and the batteries continued firing incessantly till the twenty-second day of the month, when Ginckle passed over with a di∣vision of the army, and fourteen pieces of cannon. About four in the afternoon, the grenadiers attacked the forts that commanded Thomond-bridge, and carried them sword in hand, after an obstinate resistance. The garrison had made a sally from the town to support them; and this detachment was driven back with such precipitation, that the French officer on command in that quarter, fearing the English would enter pell-mell with the fugitives, ordered the bridge to be drawn up, leaving his own men to the fury of a victorious enemy. Six hundred were killed; two hundred taken prisoners, including many officers; and a good number was drowned in the Shannon.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>Then the English made a lodgment within ten paces of the bridge∣foot; and the Irish seeing themselves surrounded on all sides, determined to ca∣pitulate. General Sarsfield and colonel Wahop signified their resolution to Scravenmore and Rouvigny: hostages were exchanged; a negotiation was im∣mediately begun, and hostilities ceased on both sides of the river. The lords∣justices arrived in the camp on the first day of October; and on the fourth the capitulation was executed, extending to all the places in the kingdom that were still in the hands of the Irish. The Roman catholics were restored to the en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyment of such liberty in the exercise of religion as was consistent with the laws of Ireland, and conformable with that which they possessed in the reign of Charles II. All persons whatever were entitled to the protection of these laws, and restored to the possession of their estates, privileges, and immunities, upon their submitting to the present government, and taking the oath of allegiance
<PB N="72" REF="750"/>
to their majesties king William and queen Mary, excepting, however, certain persons who were forfeited or exiled. This article even extended to all mer∣chants of Limerick, or any other garrison possessed by the Irish, who happened to be abroad, and had not bore arms since the declaration in the first year of the present reign, provided they should return within the term of eight months. All the persons comprised in this and the foregoing article, were indulged with a general pardon of all attainders, outlawries, treasons, misprisions of treason, pre∣munires, felonies, trespasses, and other crimes and misdemeanours whatsoever, committed since the beginning of the reign of James II<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the lords-justices promised to use their best endeavours towards the reversal of such attainders and outlawries as had passed against any of them in parliament. In order to allay the violence of party, and extinguish private animosities, it was agreed, that no person should be sued or impleaded on either side, for any trespass, or made ac∣countable for the rents, tenements, lands, or houses, he had received or enjoyed since the beginning of the war. Every nobleman and gentleman comprized in these articles, was authorized to keep a sword, a case of pistols, and a gun for his defence or amusement. The inhabitants of Limerick and other garrisons, were permitted to remove their goods and chattels, without search, visitation, or payment of duty. The lords-justices promised to use their best endeavours, that all persons comprehended in this capitulation, should for eight months be pro∣tected from all arrests and executions for debt or damage: they undertook, that their majesties should ratify these articles within the space of eight months; and use their endeavours that they might be ratified and confirmed in parliament. The subsequent article was calculated to indemnify colonel John Brown, whose estate and effects had been seized for the use of the Irish army, by Tyrconnel and Sarsfield, which last had been created lord Lucan by king James, and was now mentioned by that title. All persons were indulged with free leave to remove with their families and effects to any other country, except England and Scot∣land. All officers and soldiers in the service of king James, comprehending even the Rapparees, willing to go beyond sea, were at liberty to march in bo∣dies to the places of embarkation, to be conveyed to the continent with the French officers and troops. They were furnished with passports, convoys, and carriages by land and water; and general Ginckle engaged to provide seventy ships, if necessary, for their transportation, with two men of war for the ac∣commodation of their officers, and to serve as a convoy to the fleet. It was stipulated, That the provisions and forage for their subsistence should be payed for on their arrival in France: and, That hostages should be given for this indem∣nification, as well as for the return of the ships: That all the garrisons should march out of their respective towns and fortresses, with the honours of war: That the Irish should have liberty to transport nine hundred horses: and, That those who should choose to stay behind, might dispose of themselves according to their own fancy, after having surrendered their arms to such commissioners as the general should appoint: That all prisoners of war should be set at liberty on both sides: That the general should provide two vessels to carry over two different persons to France, with intimation of this treaty; and that none of those who were willing to quit the kingdom, should be detained on account of debt, or any other pretence. This is the substance of the famous treaty of Li∣merick, which the Irish Roman catholics consider as the great charter of their
<PB N="73" REF="760"/>
civil and religious liberties. The town of Limerick was surrendered to Ginckle; but both sides agreed, that the two armies should intrench themselves, until the Irish should embark, that no disorders might arise from a communication.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The protestant subjects of Ireland were extremely disgusted at these concessions made in favour of vanquished rebels, who had exercised such acts of cruelty and rapine. They complained, That they themselves, who had suffered for their loyalty to king William, were neglected, and obliged to sit down with their losses, while their enemies, who had shed so much blood in opposing his government, were indemnified by the articles of the capitulation, and even favoured with particular indulgences. They were dismissed with the honours of war; they were transported at the government's expence, to fight against the English in foreign countries: an honourable provision was made for the Rapparees, who were professed banditti; the Roman catholic in∣terest in Ireland obtained the sanction of regal authority; attainders were over∣looked, forfeitures annulled, pardons extended, and laws set aside, in order to effect a pacification. Ginckle had received orders to put an end to the war at any rate, that William might convert his whole influence and attention to the affairs of the continent. When the articles of capitulation were ratified, and hostages exchanged for their being duly executed, about two thousand Irish foot and three hundred horse, began their march for Cork, where they proposed to take shipping for France, under the conduct of Sarsfield; but, three regiments refusing to quit the kingdom, delivered up their arms; and dispersed to their former habitations. Those who remained at Limerick embarked on the se∣venth day of November, in French transports; and sailed immediately to France, under convoy of a French squadron which had arrived in the bay of Dingle immediately after the capitulation was signed. Twelve thousand men chose to undergo exile from their native country, rather than submit to the government of king William. When they arrived in France, they were wel∣comed by a letter from James, who thanked them for their loyalty; told them they should still serve under his commission and command; and that the king of France had already given orders for their being new cloathed, and put into quarters of refreshment.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The reduction of Ireland being thus completed, baron Ginckle re∣turned to England, where he was solemnly thanked by the house of commons for his great services, after he had been created earl of Athlone by his majesty. When the parliament met on the twenty-second day of October, the king in his speech insisted upon the necessity of sending a strong fleet to sea, early in the season, and of maintaining a considerable army to annoy the enemy abroad, as well as to protect the kingdom from insult and invasion; for which purposes, he said, sixty-five thousand men would be barely sufficient. Each house pre∣sented an address of congratulation upon his majesty's safe return to England, and the reduction of Ireland: they promised to assist him to the utmost of their power, in prosecuting the war with France; and, at the same time, drew up addresses to the queen, acknowledging her prudent administration during his ma∣jesty's absence. Notwithstanding this appearance of cordiality and complaisance, a spirit of discontent had insinuated itself into both houses of parliament, and even infected great part of the nation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> great number of individuals who wished well to their country, could not, without anxiety and resentment, behold the interest of the nation sa∣crificed
<PB N="$4" REF="770"/>
to foreign connections, and the king's favour so partially bestowed upon Dutchmen, in prejudice of his English subjects. They observed, that the number of forces he demanded was considerably greater than that of any army which had ever been payed by the public, even when the nation was in the most imminent danger: that, instead of contributing as allies to the maintenance of the war upon the continent, they had embarked as principals, and bore the greatest part of the burthen, though they had the least share of the profit. They even insinuated, that such a standing army was more calculated to make the king absolute at home, than to render him formidable abroad; and the secret friends of the late king did not fail to enforce these insinuations. They renewed their animadversions upon the disagreeable part of his character: they d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elt upon his proud reserve, his sullen silence, his imperious disposition, and his base ingratitude, particularly to the earl of Marlborough, whom he had dis∣missed from all his employments, immediately after the signal exploits he had performed in Ireland. The disgrace of this nobleman was partly ascribed to the freedom with which he had complained of the king's undervaluing his ser∣vices, and partly to the intrigues of his wife, who had gained an ascendancy over the princess Anne of Denmark, and is said to have employed her influence in somenting a jealousy between the two sisters. The malecontents of the whiggish faction, enraged to find their credit declining at court, joined in the cry which the Jacobites had raised against the government. They scrupled not to say, that the arts of corruption were shamefully practised, to secure a majority in parliament: that the king was as tender of the prerogative as any of his predecessors had ever been: and, that he even ventured to admit Jaco∣bites into his council, because they were the known tools of arbitrary power. These reflections alluded to the earls of Rochester and Ranelagh, who, with Sir Edward Seymour, had been lately created privy-counsellors. Rochester enter∣tained very high notions of regal authority; he proposed severity as one of the best supports of government; was clear in understanding, violent in his temper, and incorrupt in his principles. Ranelagh was a man of parts and pleasure, who possessed the most plausible and winning address; and was capable of trans∣acting the most important and intricate affairs, in the midst of riot and excess. He had managed the revenue of Ireland in the reign of Charles II. enjoyed the office of pay-master in the army of king James; and maintained the same footing under the government of William and Mary. Sir Edward Seymour was the proudest commoner in England, and the boldest orator that ever filled the speaker's chair. He was intimately acquainted with the business of the house, and knew every individual member so exactly, that with one glance of his eye he could prognosticate the fate of every motion. He had opposed the court with great acrimony, questioned the king's title, censured his conduct, and re∣flected upon his character. Nevertheless, he now became a proselyte, and was brought into the treasury.</P>

<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The commons voted three millions, four hundred and eleven thou∣sand, six hundred and seventy-five pounds for the use of the ensuing year; but, the establishment of funds for raising these supplies, was retarded, partly by the ill humour of the opposition, and partly by intervening affairs that diverted the attention of the commons. Several eminent merchants presented a petition to the house against the East-India company, charging them with manifold abuses;
<PB N="75" REF="780"/>
at the same time, a counter-petition was delivered by the company, and the affair referred to the examination of a committee appointed for that purpose. After a minute enquiry into the nature of the complaints, the commons voted certain regulations with respect to the stock and the traffic; and resolved to petition his majesty, that, according to the said regulations, the East-India company should be incorporated by charter. The committee was ordered to bring in a bill for this establishment; but divers petitions being presented against it, and the company's answers proving unsatisfactory, the house addressed the king to dissolve it, and grant a charter to a new company. He said it was an affair of great importance to the trade of the kingdom; therefore he would consider the subject, and in a little time return a positive answer. The parliament was like∣wise amused by a pretended conspiracy of the papists in Lancashire, to raise a rebellion, and restore James to the throne. Several persons were seized, and some witnesses examined; but, nothing appeared to justify the information. At length, one Fuller, a prisoner in the King's-bench, offered his evidence, and was brought to the bar of the house of commons, where he produced some papers. He obtained a blank pass from the king for two persons, who, he said, would come from the continent to give evidence. He was afterwards exa∣mined at his own lodgings, where he affirmed, that colonel Thomas Delaval, and James Hayes, were the witnesses for whom he had procured the pass and the protection. Search was made for them according to his direction; but no such persons were found. Then the house declared Fuller a notorious impostor, cheat, and false accuser. He was, at the request of the commons, prosecuted by the attorney-general, and sentenced to stand in the pillory; a disgrace which he accordingly undewent.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>A bill for regulating trials in cases of high treason having been layed aside by the lords in the preceding session, was now again brought upon the carpet, and passed the lower house. The design of this bill was, to secure the sub∣ject from the rigours to which he had been exposed in the late reigns. It pro∣vided, That the prisoner should be furnished with a copy of his indictment, as also of the pannel ten days before his trial: and, That his witnesses should be examined upon oath, as well as those of the crown. The lords, in their own behalf added a clause, enacting, That upon the trial of any peer or peeress, for treason or misprision of treason, all the peers who have a right to sit and vote in parliament, should be duly summoned to assist at the trial: That this notice should be given twenty days before the trial: and, That every peer so summoned, and appearing, should vote upon the occasion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The commons re∣jected this amendment; and a free conference ensued. The point was argued with great vivacity on both sides, which served only to inflame the dispute, and render each party the more tenacious of their own opinion. After three con∣ferences that produced nothing but animosity, the bill was dropped; for, the commons resolved to bear the hardships of which they complained, rather than be relieved at the expence of purchasing a new privilege to the lords; and with∣out this advantage the peers would not contribute to their relief.</P>

<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The next object that engrossed the attention of the lower house<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was the miscarriage of the fleet during the summer's expedition. Admiral Russel, who commanded at sea, having been joined by a Dutch squadron, sailed in quest of the enemy; but, as the French king had received undoubted intelligence,
<PB N="76" REF="790"/>
that the combined squadrons were superior to his navy in number of ships and weight of metal, he ordered Tourville to avoid an engagement. This officer acted with such vigilance, caution, and dexterity, as baffled all the endeavours of Russel, who was moreover perplexed with obscure and contra∣dictory orders. Nevertheless, he cruised all summer either in the channel or in soundings, for the protection of the trade, and in particular secured the home∣ward<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bound Smyrna fleet, in which the English and Dutch had a joint con∣cern, amounting to four millions sterling. Having scoured the channel and run along great part of the French coast, he returned to Torbay in the beginning of August, and received fresh orders to put to sea again, notwithstanding his repeated remonstrances against exposing large ships to the storms that always blow about the time of the equinox. He therefore sailed back to soundings, where he continued cruising till the second day of September, when he was overtaken by a violent tempest, which drove him into the channel, and obliged him to make for the port of Plymouth. The weather being hazy, he reached the Sound with great difficulty; the Coronation, a second-rate, foundered at anchor off the Ram-Head; the Harwich, a third-rate, bulged upon the rocks, and pe∣rished; two others ran ashore, but were got off with little damage; the whole fleet was scattered and distressed. The nation murmured at the supposed mis∣conduct of the admiral, and the commons subjected him to an inquiry: but, when they examined his papers, orders, and instructions, they perceived he had adhered to them with great punctuality, and thought proper to drop the prose∣cution, out of tenderness to the ministry. Then the house took into considera∣tion, some letters which had been intercepted in a French ship taken by Sir Ralph Delaval. Three of these are said to have been written by king James, and the rest sealed with his seal. They related to the plan of an insurrection in Scotland and in the northern parts of England; and Legg lord Dartmouth, with one Crew, being mentioned in them as agents and abettors in the design, warrants were immediately issued against them.

<P>The king had suffered so much in his reputation by his complaisance to the presbyterians of Scotland, and was so displeased with the conduct of that stubborn sect of religionists, that he thought proper to admit some prelatists into the administration. Johnston, who had been sent envoy to the elector of Brandenburg, was recalled, and, with the master of Stair, made joint secretary of Scotland; Melvill, who had declined in his importance, was made lord privy-seal of that kingdom; Tweedale was constituted lord chancellor; Craw∣furd retained the office of president in the council; and Lothian was ap∣pointed high commissioner to the general assembly. The parliament was ad∣journed to the fifteenth day of April, because it was not yet compliant enough to be assembled with safety; and the episcopal clergy were admitted to a share of the church-government. These measures, instead of healing the divisions, served only to inflame the animosity of the two parties. The episcopalians triumphed in the king's favour, and began to treat their antagonists with inso∣lence and scorn; the presbyterians were incensed to see their friends disgraced, and their enemies distinguished by the royal indulgence. They insisted upon the authority of the law, which happened to be upon their side: they became more than ever sour, surly, and implacable; they refused to concur with the prelatists, or abate in the least circumstance of discipline; and the assembly was dissolved, without any time or place assigned for the next meeting. The pres∣byterians pretended an independent right of assembling annually, even without a call from his majesty; they therefore adjourned themselves, after having protested against the dissolution. The king resented this measure as an inso∣lent invasion of the prerogative, and conceived an aversion to the whole sect, who in their turn began to lose all respect for his person and government.</P>

<P>As the Highlanders were not yet totally reduced, the earl of Brai∣dalbin undertook to bring them over, by distributing sums of money among their chiefs; and fifteen thousand pounds were remitted from England for this purpose. The clans being informed of this remittance, suspected that the earl's design was to appropriate to himself the best part of the money, and when he began to treat with them made such extravagant demands, that he found his scheme im∣practicable. He was therefore obliged to refund the sum he had received; and he resolved to wreak his vengeance with the first opportunity, on those who had frustrated his intention. He who chiefly th warted his negotiation was Mac∣donald of Glencoe; and his opposition arose from a private circumstance, which ought to have had no effect upon a treaty that regarded the public weal. Macdonald had plundered the lands of Braidalbin during the course of hosti∣lities; and this nobleman insisted upon being indemnified for his losses, from the other's share of the money which he was employed to distribute. The High∣lander not only refused to acquiesce in these terms, but, by his influence among the clans, defeated the whole scheme, and the earl in revenge devoted him to destruction. King William had by proclamation offered an indemnity to all
<PB N="78" REF="810"/>
those who had been in arms against him, provided they would submit and take the oaths by a certain day; and this was prolonged to the end of the present year, with a denunciation of military execution against those who should hold out after the end of December. Macdonald, intimidated by this declaration, repaired on the very last day of the month to Fort-William, and desired that the oaths might be tendered to him by colonel Hill governor of that fortress. As this officer was not vested with the power of a civil magistrate, he refused to administer them; and Macdonald set out immediately for Inverary, the county∣town of Argyle. Though the ground was covered with snow and the weather intensely cold, he travelled with such diligence, that the term prescribed by the proclamation was but one day elapsed when he reached the place, and ad∣dressed himself to Sir Colin Campbell sheriff of the county, who, in considera∣tion of his disappointment at Fort-William, was prevailed upon to administer the oaths to him and his adherents. Then they returned to their own habita∣tions in the valley of Glencoe, in full confidence of being protected by the go∣vernment, to which they had so solemnly submitted.</P>

<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>Braidalbin had represented Macdonald at court as an incorrigible rebel, and a ruffian inured to bloodshed and rapine, who would never be obedient to the laws of his country, nor live peaceably under any sovereign. He observed that he had payed no regard to the proclamation; and proposed that the go∣vernment should sacrifice him to the quiet of the kingdom, in extirpating him, with his family and dependents, by military execution. His advice was supported by the suggestions of the other Scottish ministers; and the king, whose chief virtue was not humanity, signed a warrant for the destruction of those unhappy people, though it does not appear that he knew of Macdonald's submission. An order for this barbarous execution, signed and counter-signed by his ma∣jesty's own hand, being transmitted to the master of Stair, secretary for Scotland, he sent particular directions to Livingstone, who commanded the troops in that kingdom, to put the inhabitants of Glencoe to the sword, charging him to take no prisoners, that the scene might be more terrible. In the month of Fe∣bruary captain Campbell of Glenlyon, by virtue of an order from major Dun∣canson, marched into the valley of Glencoe, with a company of soldiers belong∣ing to Argyle's Highland regiment, on pretence of levying the arrears of the land-tax and hearth-money. When Macdonald demanded whether they came as friends or enemies, he answered as friends, and promised upon his honour that neither he nor his people should sustain the least injury. In consequence of this declaration, he and his men were received with the most cordial hospi∣tality, and lived fifteen days with the men of the valley, in all the ap∣pearance of the most unreserved friendship. At length the fatal period approached. Macdonald and Campbell having passed the day together, parted about seven in the evening, with mutual professions of the warmest affection. The younger Macdonald, perceiving the guards doubled, began to suspect some treachery, and communicated his suspicion to his brother; but neither he nor the father would harbour the least doubt of Campbell's sin∣cerity: nevertheless, the two young men went forth privately to make further observations. They overheard the common soldiers say they liked not the work; that though they would have willingly fought the Macdonalds of the Glen fairly in the field, they held it base to murder them in cool blood, but that their officers were answerable for the treachery. When the youths hasted
<PB N="79" REF="820"/>
back to apprise their father of the impending danger, they saw the house already surrounded; they heard the discharge of muskets, the shrieks of women and children, and, being destitute of arms, secured their own lives by imme∣diate flight. The savage ministers of vengeance had entered the old man's chamber, and shot him through the head. He fell down dead in the arms of his wife, who died next day, distracted by the horror of her husband's fate. The laird of Auchintrincken, Macdonald's guest, who had three months before this period submitted to the government, and at this very time had a protection in his pocket, was put to death without question. A boy of eight years, who fell at Campbell's feet, imploring mercy, and offering to serve him for life, was stabbed to the heart by one Drummond, a subaltern officer. Eight and thirty persons suffered in this manner, the greater part of whom were surprised in their beds, and hurried into eternity before they had time to implore the divine mercy. The design was to butcher all the males under seventy that lived in the valley, the number of whom amounted to two hundred: but some of the detachments did not arrive soon enough to secure the passes; so that one hundred and sixty escaped. Campbell, having perpetrated this brutal massacre, ordered all the houses to be burned, made a prey of all the cattle and effects that were found in the valley, and left the helpless women and children, whose fathers and hus∣bands he had murdered, naked and forlorn, without covering, food, or shel∣ter, in the midst of the snow that covered the whole face of the country, at the distance of six long miles from any inhabited place. Distracted with grief and horror, surrounded with the shades of night, shivering with cold, and appalled with the apprehension of immediate death from the swords of those who had sacrificed their friends and kinsmen, they could not endure such a complication of calamities, but generally perished in the waste before they could receive the least comfort or assistance. This barbarous massacre, performed under the sanction of king William's authority, though it answered the immediate pur∣pose of the court, by striking terror into the hearts of the Jacobite Highlanders, excited the horror of all those who had not renounced every sentiment of humanity, and produced such an aversion to the government, as all the arts of a ministry could never totally surmount. A detail of the particulars was pub∣lished at Paris with many exaggerations; and the Jacobites did not fail to ex∣patiate upon every circumstance, in domestic libels and private conversation. The king, alarmed at the outcry which was raised upon this occasion, ordered an inquiry to be set on foot, and dismissed the master of Stair from his employ∣ment<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Story.

He returned with advice that king James would certainly land in the spring; and that colonel Parker and other officers should be sent over with full instructions, touching their conduct at and before he king's arrival.

<P>Mean while, James addressed a letter to several lords, who had been formerly members of his council, as well as to divers ladies of quality and dis∣tinction, intimating the pregnancy of his queen, and requiring them to attend as witnesses at the labour. He took notice of the injury his family and honour had sustained, from the cruel aspersions of his enemies concerning the birth of his son; and as providence had now favoured him with an opportunity of refuting the calumny of those who assumed that the queen was incapable of child-bear∣ing, he affored them, in the name of his brother the French king, as well as upon his own royal word, that they should have free leave to visit his court, and return after the labour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letter was directed not only to privy∣counsellors, but also to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Somer∣set and Beaufort, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the countesses of Derb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Rut and, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ladies <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Fretchville, these of Sir John Trevor speaker of the house of commons, Sir Edward Se m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, Sir Christopher Musgrave, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Thomas Stamford lord mayor of London, Sir William Ast<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urst and Sir Richard Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ett the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Dr. Chamber∣lian the famous practitioner <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>.</NOTE>. This invitation, however, no person would venture to accept. He afterwards employed his em<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssaries in circulating a printed declaration, importing that the king of France had enabled him to make another effort to retrieve his crown; and that, although he was furnished with a number of troops sufficient to untle the hands of his subjects, he did not intend to deprive them of their share in the glory of restoring their lawful king and their ancient government. He exhorted the people to join his standard. He as∣sured them that the foreign auxiliaries should behave with the most regular dis∣cipline, and be sent back immediately after his re-establishment. He observed, that when such a number of his subjects were so infatua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, as to concur with the unnatural design of the prince of Orange, he had chose to rely upon the fidelity of his English army, and refused considerable succours that were offered to him by his most christian majesty; that when he was ready to oppose force
<PB N="81" REF="840"/>
with force, he nevertheless offered to give all reasonable satisfaction to his sub∣jects who had been misled, and endeavoured to open their eyes with respect to the vain pretences of his adversary, whose aim was not the reformation but the subversion of the government; that when he saw himself deserted by his army, betrayed by his ministers, abandoned by his favourites, and even his own chil∣dren, and at last rudely driven from his own palace by a guard of insolent fo∣reigners; he had, for his personal safety, taken refuge in France: that his re∣treat from the malice and cruel designs of the usurper had been construed into an abdication, and the whole constitution of the monarchy destroyed by a set of men illegally assembled, who, in fact, had no power to alter the property of the meanest subject. He expressed his hope that by this time the nation had fairly examined the account, and from the losses and enormous expence of the three last years, were convinced that the remedy was worse than the disease; that the beginning, like the first years of Nero's reign, would, in all probability, be found the mildest part of the usurpation, and the instruments of the new estab∣lishment live to suffer severely by the tyranny they had raised; that even, though the usurpation should continue during his life, an indisputable title would survive in his issue, and expose the kingdom to all the miseries of a civil war. He not only sollicited but commanded his good subjects to join him, according to their duty and the oaths they had taken. He forbade them to pay taxes or any part of the revenue to the usurper. He promised pardon and even rewards to all those who should return to their duty, and to procure in his first parliament an act of indemnity, with an exception of certain persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those excepted were the duke of Ormond, the marquis of Winchester, the earls of Sunder∣land, Bath, Danby, and Nottingham, the lords Newport, Delamere, Wiltshire, Colchester, Corn∣bury, Dunblain, and Churchill; the bishops of London and St. Asaph, Sir Robert Howard, Sir John Worden, Sir Samuel Grimstone, Sir Stephen Fox, Sir George Treby, Sir Basil Dix∣well, Sir James Oxenden, Dr. John Tillotson, Dr. Gilbert Burnet, Francis Russel, Richard Le∣vison, John Trenchard, Charles Duncomb, ci∣tizen of London; Edwards, Stapleton, and Hunt, fishermen, and all others who had offered perso∣nal indignities to him at Feversham; or had been concerned in the barbarous murder of John Ash∣ton, Cross, or any others who had suffered death for their loyalty; and all spies or such as had be∣trayed his councils, during his late absence from England.</NOTE> whom he now enumerated. He declared, that all soldiers who should quit the service of the usurper, and en∣list under his banners, might depend upon receiving their pardon and arrears; and that the foreign troops, upon laying down their arms, should be payed and transported to their respective countries. He solemnly protested that he would protect and maintain the church of England as by law established, in all her rights, privileges, and possessions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he signified his resolution to use his in∣fluence with the parliament for allowing liberty of conscience to all his subjects, as an indulgence agreeable to the spirit of the christian religion, and conducive to the wealth and prosperity of the nation. He said his principal care should be to heal the wounds of the late distractions; to restore trade, by observing the act of navigation, which had been lately so much violated in favour of strangers; to put the navy in a flourishing condition; and to take every step that might contribute to the greatness of the monarchy and the happiness of the people. He concluded with professions of resignation to the divine will, declaring, that all who should reject his offers of mercy, and appear in arms against him, would be answerable to almighty God for all the blood that should be spilt, and all

<P>While this declaration operated variously on the minds of the peo∣ple, colonel Parker, with some other officers, enlisted men privately for the service of James, in the counties of York, I ancaster, and the bishopric of Durham; and, at the same time, Fountaine and Holman were employed in raising two regiments of horse at London, that they might join their master im∣mediately after his landing. His partisans sent Captain Loyd with an express to the lord Melfort, containing a detail of these particulars, with an assurance that they had brought over rear-admiral Carter to the interest of his majesty. They likewise transmitted a list of the ships that composed the English fleet; and exhorted James to use his influence with the French king, that the count de Tourville might be ordered to attack them before they should be joined by the Dutch squadron. It was in consequence of this advice, that Lewis com∣manded Tourville to fall upon the English fleet, even without waiting for the Toulon squadron, commanded by the marquis D'Etrees. By this time James had repaired to La Hogue, and was ready to embark with his army, consisting of a body of French troops, together with some English and Scottish refugees, and the regiments which had been transported from Ireland by virtue of the ca∣pitulation of Limerick.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The ministry of England was informed of all these particulars, partly by some agents of James, who betrayed his cause, and partly by admiral Carter, who gave the queen to understand he had been tampered with; and was instructed to amuse the Jacobites with a negotiation. King William no sooner arrived in Holland, than he hastened the naval preparations of the Dutch, so as that their fleet was ready for sea sooner than it was expected; and when he received the first intimation of the projected descent, he detached general Tal∣mash with three of the English regiments from Holland. These, reinforced with other troops remaining in England, were ordered to encamp in the neigh∣bourhood of Portsmouth. The queen issued a proclamation, commanding all papists to depart from London and Westminster: the members of both houses of parliament were required to meet on the twenty-fourth day of May, that she might avail herself of their advice in such a perilous conjuncture. War∣rants were expedited for apprehending divers disaffected persons; and they withdrawing themselves from their respective places of abode, a proclamation was published for discovering and bringing them to justice. The earls of Scars∣dale, Litchfield, and Newburgh, the lords Griffin, Forbes, Sir John Fenwick, Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe, and others, found means to elude the search. The earls of Huntingdon and Marlborough were sent to the Tower: Edward Ridley, Knevitt, Hastings, and Robert Ferguson, were imprisoned in Newgate. The bishop of Rochester was confined to his own house: the lords Brudenel and Fan∣shaw were secured: the earls of Dunmore, Middleton, and Sir Andrew For∣rester, were discovered in a quaker's house, and committed to prison, with se∣veral other persons of distinction. The trained-bands of London and West∣minster were armed by the queen's direction, and she reviewed them in person; admiral Russel was ordered to put to sea with all possible expedition; and Carter, with a squadron of eighteen sail, continued to cruize along the French coast, to observe the motions of the enemy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<PB N="83" REF="860" MS="y"/>
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>On the eleventh day of May, Russel failed from Rye to St. Helen's, where he was joined by the squadrons under Delavil and Carter. There he received a letter from the earl of Nottingham, intimating, that a re∣port having spread of the queen's suspecting the fidelity of the sea-officers, her majesty ordered him to declare in her name, that she reposed the most intire confidence in their attachment; and believed the report was raised by the ene∣mies of the government. The flag-officers and captains forthwith drew up a very loyal and dutiful address, which was graciously received by the queen, and published for the satisfaction of the nation. Russel being reinforced by the Dutch squadrons, commanded by Allemonde, Callembergh, and Vandergoes, set sail for the coast of France on the eighteenth day of May, with a fleet of ninety-nine ships of the line, besides frigates and fire-ships. Next day about three o'clock in the morning, he discovered the enemy, under the count de Tour∣ville, and threw out the signal for the line of battle, which by eight o'clock was formed in good order, the Dutch in the van, the blue division in the rear, and the red in the center. The French fleet did not exceed sixty-three ships of the line, and as they were to windward, Tourville might have avoided an engage∣ment; but, he had received a positive order to fight, on the supposition that the Dutch and English squadrons had not joined. Lewis indeed was apprised of their junction before they were descried by his admiral, to whom he dispatched a countermanding order by two several vessels; but, one of them was taken by the English, and the other did not arrive till the day after the engagement.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="27" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Tourville therefore, in obedience to the first mandate, bore down along side of Russel's own ship, which he engaged at a very small distance. He fought with great fury till one o'clock, when his rigging and sails being considerably damaged, his ship, the Rising-Sun, that carried one hundred and four cannon, was towed out of the line in great disorder. Nevertheless, the engagement continued till three, when the fleets were parted by a thick fog. When this abated, the enemy were descried flying to the northward; and Russel made the signal for chasing. Part of the blue squadron came up with the enemy about eight in the evening, and engaged them half an hour, during which admiral Carter was mortally wounded. Finding himself in extremity, he exhorted his captain to fight as long as the ship could swim; and expired with great composure. At length, the French bore away for Conquet-Road, having lost four ships in this day's action. Next day about eight in the morning, they were discovered crowding away to the westward, and the com∣bined fleets chased with all the sails they could carry, until Russel's foretop-mast came by the board. Though he was retarded by this accident, they still con∣tinued the pursuit, and he anchored near Cape La Hogue. On the twenty∣second of the month, about seven in the morning, part of the French fleet was perceived near the Race of Alderney, some at anchor, and some driving to the eastward with the tide of flood. He, and the ships nearest him, immediately slipped their cables and chased. The Royal-Sun having lost her masts, ran ashore near Cherbourg, where she was burned by Sir Ralph Delaval, together with the Admirable, another first-rate, and the Conquerant of eighty guns. Eighteen other ships of their fleet ran into La Hogue, where they were attacked by Sir George Rooke, who destroyed them, and a great number of transports loaded with ammunition, in the midst of a terrible fire from the enemy, and in
<PB N="84" REF="870"/>
fight of the Irish camp. Sir John Ashby, with his own squadron and some Dutch ships, pursued the rest of the French fleet, which escaped through the Race of Alderney, by such a dangerous passage as the English could not at∣tempt, without exposing their ships to the most imminent hazard. This was a very mortifying defeat to the French king, who had been so long flattered with an uninterrupted series of victories; and reduced James to the lowest ebb of despondence, as it frustrated the whole scheme of his embarkation, and over∣whelmed his friends in England with grief and despair. Some historians alledge, that Russel did not improve his victory with all advantages that might have been obtained before the enemy recovered of their consternation. They say, his affection to the service was in a good measure cooled by the disgrace of his friend the earl of Marlborough: that he hated the earl of Nottingham, by whose canal he received his orders: and, that he adhered to the letter rather than the spirit of his instructions. But this is a malicious imputation; and a very ungrateful return for his manifold services to the nation. He acted in this whole expedition with the genuine spirit of a British admiral. He plyed from the Nore to the Downs with a very scanty wind, through the dangerous sands, contrary to the advice of all his pilots; and by this bold passage effected a junction of the different squadrons, which otherwise the French would have attacked singly, and perhaps defeated. He behaved with great gallantry dur∣ing the engagement; he destroyed about fifteen of the enemy's capital ships; in a word, he obtained such a decisive victory, that during the remaining part of the war, the French would not hazard another battle by sea with the English.</P>

<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Russel having ordered Sir John Ashby, and the Dutch admiral Callembergh, to steer toward Havre de Grace, and endeavour to destroy the remainder of the French fleet, sailed back to St. Helen's, that the damaged ships might be refitted, and the fleet furnished with fresh supplies of provision and ammunition: but, his principal motive was to take on board a number of troops provided for a descent upon France, which had been projected by Eng∣land and Holland, with a view to alarm and distract the enemy in their own dominions. The queen was so pleased with the victory, that she ordered thirty thousand pounds to be distributed among the sailors; medals to be struck in ho∣nour of the action; and the bodies of admiral Carter and captain Hastings, who had been killed in the battle, to be interred with great funeral pomp. In the latter end of July, seven thousand men, commanded by the duke of Lein∣ster, embarked on board of transports, to be landed at St. Maloe's, Brest, or Rochfort; and the nation conceived the most sanguine hopes of this expedition. A council of war, consissing of land and sea-officers, being held on board the Breda, to deliberate upon the scheme of the ministry, the members unani∣mously agreed, that the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ason was too far advanced to put it in execution.

The higher the hopes of the nation had been raised by this armament, the deeper they felt their disappointment. A loud clamour was raised against the ministry, as the authors of this miscarriage. The people complained, that they were plundered and abused: that immense sums were extorted from them by the most grievous impositions: that by the infamous expedient of borrowing upon established funds, their taxes were per∣petuated: that their burdens would daily increase: that their treasure was either squandered away in chimerical projects, or expended in foreign connexions, of which England was naturally independent. They were the more ex∣cusable for exclaiming in this manner, as their trade had grievously suffered by the French privateers, which swarmed in the channel. In vain the merchants had recourse to the admiralty, which could not spare particular convoys, while large fleets were required for the defence of the nation. The French king hav∣ing nothing further to apprehend from the English armament, withdrew his troops from the coast of Normandy; and James returned in despair to St. Germain's, where his queen had been in his absence delivered of a daughter, who was born in presence of the archbishop of Paris, the keeper of the seals, and other persons of distinction.</P>

<P>Lewis had taken the field in the latter end of May. On the twen∣tieth day of that month he arrived at his camp in Flanders, with all the effemi∣nate pomp of an Asiatic emperor, attended by his women and parasites, his band of music, his dancers, his opera, and in a word, by all the ministers of luxury and sensual pleasure. Having reviewed his army, which amounted to about one hundred and twenty thousand men, he undertook the siege of Namur, which he invested on both sides of the Sambre, with about one half of his army, while the other covered the siege, under the command of Luxembourg-Namur is situated on the conflux of the Meuse and the Sambre. The citadel was deemed one of the strongest forts in Flanders, strengthened with a new work contrived by the famous engineer Coehorn, who now defended it in person. The prince de Barbason commanded the garrison, consisting of nine thousand men. The place was well supplied; and the governor knew that king William would make strong efforts for its relief: so that the besieged were animated with many concurring considerations. Notwithstanding these advantages, the assailants carried on their attacks with such vigour, that in seven days after the trenches were opened the town capitulated, and the garrison retired into the citadel. King William being joined by the troops of Brandenburgh and Liege, advanced to the Mehaigne, at the head of one hundred thousand effective men, and encamped within cannon-shot of Luxembourg's army, which lay on the other side of the river. That general, however, had taken such precautions, that the king of England could not interrupt the siege, nor attack the Erench lines without great disadvantage. The besiegers, encouraged by the presence of their monarch, and assisted by the superior abilities of Vauban their engineer, repeated their attacks with such impetuosity, that the fort of Coehorn was sur∣rendered, after a very obstinate defence, in which he himself had been dan∣gerously wounded. The citadel being thus left exposed to the approaches of the enemy, could not long withstand the violence of their operations. The two covered-ways were taken by assault; and on the twentieth of May the go∣vernor capitulated, to the unspeakable mortification of king William, who

<P>Luxembourg having placed a strong garrison in Namur, detached <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a body of troops to La Bussiere, and with the rest of his army en∣camped at Soignies. The king of England sent off detachments towards Liege and Ghent; and on the sixth day of July posted himself at Genap, resolved to seize the first opportunity of retrieving his honour, by attacking the enemy. Having received intelligence that the French general was in motion, and in∣tended to take post between St<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enkirk and Enghien, he passed the river Senne, in order to anticipate his purpose; but, in spite of all his diligence, Luxembourg gained his point; and William encamped at Lambeque, within six miles of the French army. Here he resolved, in a council of war, to attack the enemy; and the disposition was made for that purpose. The heavy baggage he ordered to be conveyed to the other side of the Senne; and one Millevoix, a detected spy, was compelled by menaces to mislead Luxembourg with false intelligence, importing, that he needed not be alarmed at the motions of the allies, who in∣tended next day to make a general forage. On the twenty-fourth day of July, the army began to move from the left, in two columns, as the ground would not admit of their marching in an extended front. The prince of Wirtemberg began the attack on the right of the enemy, at the head of ten battalions of English, Danish, and Dutch infantry; and he was supported by a considerable body of British horse and foot, commanded by lieutenant-general Mackay. Though the ground was intersected by hedges, ditches, and narrow defiles, the prince marched with such diligence, that he was in a condition to begin the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttle about two in the afternoon, when he charged the French with such im∣petu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity, that they were driven from their posts, and their whole camp became a scene of tumult and confusion. Luxembourg trusting to the intelligence he had received, allowed himself to be surprised; and it required the full exertion of his superior talents, to remedy the consequences of his neglect. He forth∣with forgot a severe indisposition under which he happened to labour; he rallied his broken battalions; he drew up his forces in order of battle, and led them to the charge in person. The duke de Chartres, who was then in the fifteenth year of his age, the dukes of Bourbon and Vendome, the prince of Conti, and a great number of volunteers of the first quality, put themselves at the head of the houshold troops, and fell with great fury upon the English, who were very ill supported by count Solmes, who commanded the center of the allies. The prince of Wirtemberg had taken one of the enemy's batteries, and actually pe∣netrated into their lines; but finding himself in danger of being overpowered by numbers, he sent an aid-de-camp twice to demand succours from Solmes, who derided his distress, saying, <Q>“Let us see what sport these English bull∣dogs will make.”</Q> At length, when the king sent an express order, com∣manding him to sustain the left wing, he made a motion with his horse, which could not act while his infantry kept their ground; and the British troops, with a few Dutch and Danes, bore the whole brunt of the engagement. They fought
<PB N="87" REF="900"/>
with surprising courage and perseverance against dreadful odds; and the event of the battle continued doubtful, until Boufflers rejoined the French army with a great body of dragoons. The allies could not sustain the additional weight of this reinforcement, before which they gave way, though the retreat was made in tolerable order; and the enemy did not think proper to prosecute the advan∣tage they had gained. In this action the confederates lost the earl of Angus, general Mackay, Sir John Lanier, Sir Robert Douglas, and many other gallant officers, together with about three thousand men left dead on the spot, a like number wounded or taken, a great many colours and standards, and several pieces of cannon.</P>

<P>The French reaped no solid advantage from their victory, which cost them about three thousand men, including the prince of Turenne, the mar∣quis de Bellefonds, Tilladet, and Fermaçon, with many officers of distinction: as for Millevoix the spy, he was hanged on a tree, on the right wing of the allied army. King William retired unmolested to his own camp; and notwithstand∣ing all his overthrows, continued a respectable enemy, by dint of invincible for∣titude, and a genius fruitful in resources. That he was formidable to the French nation, even in the midst of his ill success, appears from divers undeniable tes∣timonies, and from none more than from the extravagance of joy expressed by the people of France, on occasion of this unimportant victory. When the princes who served in the battle returned to Paris, the roads through which they passed were almost blocked up with multitudes; and the whole air resounded with ac∣clamation. All the ornaments of the fashion peculiar to both sexes, adopted the name of Steenkirk; every individual who had been personally engaged in the action, was revered as being of a superior species; and the transports of the women rose almost to a degree of frenzy.</P>

<P>The French ministry did not intirely depend upon the fortune of the war for the execution of their revenge against king William. They likewise employed assassins to deprive him of life, in the most treacherous manner. When Louvois died, his son the marquis de Barbesieux, who succeeded him in his office of secretary, found among his papers the draught of a s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heme for this purpose; and immediately revived the design by means of the chevalier de Grandval, a captain of dragoons in the service. He and colonel Parker engaged one Dumont, who undertook to assassinate king William. Madame de Mainte∣non and Paparel, paymaster to the French army, were privy to the scheme, which they encouraged; and the conspirators are said to have obtained an audience of king James, who approved of their undertaking, and assured them of his protection; but, that unfortunate monarch was unjustly charged with the guilt of countenancing the intended murder, as they communicated nothing to him but an attempt to seize the person of the prince of Orange. Dumont actu∣ally inlisted in the confederate army, that he might have the better opportu∣nity to shoot the king of England when he should ride out to visit the lines, while Grandval and Parker repaired to the French camp, with orders to Luxembourg to furnish them with a party of horse for the rescue of Dumont, after the blow should be struck. Whether this man's heart failed him, or he could not find the opportunity he desired, after having resided some weeks in the camp of the allies, he retired to Hanover; but still corresponded with Grandval and Barbe∣sieux. This last admitted one Leefdale, a Dutch baron, into the secret, and likewise imparted it to monsieur Chanlais, quarter master-general of the French army,
<PB N="88" REF="910"/>
who animated Grandval and Leefdale with the promise of a considerable reward; and promised to co-operate with Parker for bringing off Dumont, for he still per∣sisted in his undertaking. Leefdale had been sent from Holland on purpose to dive to the bottom of this conspiracy, in consequence of advice given by the British envoy at Hanover, where Dumont had dropped some hints that alarmed his suspicion. The Dutchman not only insinuated himself into the confidence of the conspirators, but likewise inveigled Grandval to Eyndhoven, where he was apprehended. Understanding that Dumont had already discovered the design to the duke of Zell, and that he himself had been betrayed by Leefdale, he freely confessed all the particulars, without enduring the torture; and being found guilty by a court-martial, was executed as a traitor.</P>

<P>About this period the duke of Leinster arrived at Ostend with the troops which had been embarked at St. Helen's. He was furnished with cannon sent down the Meuse from Maestricht; he was reinforced by a large detachment from the king's camp at Gramont, under the command of general Talmash. He took possession of Furnes, was joined by the earl of Portland and Mr. D'Auverquerque, and a disposition was made for investing Dunkirk; but, on further deliberation, the enterprize was thought very dangerous, and therefore layed aside. Furnes and Dixmuyde lately reduced by brigadier Ramsay, were strengthened with new works, and secured with strong garrisons. The cannon were sent back, and the troops returning to Ostend, reimbarked for England. This fruitless expedition, added to the inglorious issue of the cam∣paign, increased the ill humour of the British nation. They taxed William with having lain inactive at Gramont with an army of one hundred thousand men, while Luxembourg was posted at Courtray with half that number. They said, if he had found the French lines too strong to be forced, he might have passed the Scheld higher up, and not only layed the enemy's conquests under contribu∣tion, but even marched into the bowels of France; and they complained that Furnes and Dixmuyde were not worth the sums expended in maintaining their garrisons. On the twenty-sixth day of September king William left the army under the command of the elector of Bavaria, and repaired to his house at Loo: in two days after his departure the camp at Gramont was broke up; the infantry marched to Marienkerke, and the horse to Gaure. On the sixteenth day of October the king receiving intelligence, that Boufflers had invested Charleroy, and Luxembourg taken post in the neighbourhood of Condé, ordered the troops to be instantly reassembled between the village of Ixells and Halle, with design to raise the siege; and repaired to Brussels, where he held a council of war, in which the proper measures were concerted. Then he returned to Holland, leaving the command with the elector of Bavaria, who forthwith began his march for Charleroy. At his approach Boufflers abandoned the siege, and moved towards Philipville. The elector having reinforced the place, and thrown supplies into Aeth, distributed his forces into winter-quarters. Then Luxembourg, who had cantoned his army between Condé, Leuze, and Tournay, returned to Paris, leaving Boufflers to command in his absence.</P>

<P>The allies had been unsuccessful in Flanders, and they were not fortunate in Germany. The landgrave of Hesse-Cassel undertook the siege of Eberemburg, which however he was obliged to abandon. The duke de Lorges, who commanded the French forces on the Rhine, surprised, defeated, and took the duke of Wirtemberg, who had posted himself with four thousand horse near
<PB N="89" REF="920"/>
Eidelsheim to check the progress of the enemy. Count Tallard, having invested Rhinefeld, the landgrave marched to its relief with such expedition, that the French were obliged to desist, and retreat with considerable damage. The elector of Saxony had engaged to bring an army into the field; but, he com∣plained that the emperor left the burden of the war with France upon the princes, and converted his chief power and attention to the campaign in Hun∣gary. A jealousy and misunderstanding ensued; Schoening, the Saxon general, in his way to the hot-baths at Dablitz in Bohemia, was seized by the emperor's order, on suspicion of having maintained a private correspondence with the enemy; and very warm expostulations on this subject passed between the courts of Vienna and Dresden. Schoening was detained two years in custody; and at length released, on condition that he should never be employed again in the empire. The war in Hungary produced no event of importance. The mi∣nistry of the Ottoman Porte was distracted by factions, and the seraglio threatened with tumults. The people were tired of maintaining an unsuccessful war: the vizir was deposed; and in the midst of this confusion, the garrison of Great Waradin, which had been blocked up by the Imperialists during the whole winter, surrendered by capitulation. Lord Paget, the English ambassa∣dor at Vienna, was sent to Constantinople with powers to mediate a peace; but the terms offered by the emperor were rejected at the porte: the Turkish army lay upon the defensive, and the season was spent in a fruitless negotiation.</P>

<P>The prospect of affairs in Piedmont was favourable for the allies; but the court of France had brought the pope to an accommodation, and began to tamper with the duke of Savoy. Mr. Chanlais was sent to Turin with advantageous proposals, which, however, the duke would not accept, because he thought himself intitled to better terms, considering that the allied army in Piedmont amounted to fifty thousand effective men, while Catinat's forces were not sufficient to defend his conquests in that country. In the month of July the duke marched into Dauphiné, where he plundered a number of village, and reduced the fortress of Guillestre; then passing the river Darance, he invested Ambrun, which, after a siege of nine days, surrendered on capitu∣lation, and laid all the neighbouring towns under contribution. Here duke Schomberg, who commanded the auxiliaries in the English pay, published a declaration, in the name of king William, inviting the people to join his stan∣dard; assuring them that his master had no other design in ordering his troops to invade France, but that of restoring the noblesse to their ancient splendour, their parliaments to their former authority, and the people to their just privileges. He even offered his protection to the clergy, and to use his endeavours for reviv∣ing the edict of Nantes, which had been guaranteed by the kings of England. These offers, however, produced little effect; and the Germans ravaged the whole country, in revenge for the cruelties which the French had committed in the Palatinate. The allied army advanced from Ambrun to Gap, on the fron∣tiers of Provence; and this place submitted without opposition. The inhabi∣tants of Grenoble, the capital of Dauphiné, and even of Lyons, were over∣whelmed with consternation; and a fairer opportunity of humbling France could never occur, as that part of the kingdom had been left almost quite de∣senceless: but this was fatally neglected, either from the spirit of dissension, which began to prevail in the allied army, or from the indisposition of the duke

of Savoy, who was seized with the small-pox in the midst of this expedition; or, lastly, to his want of sincerity, which was shrewdly suspected. He is said to have maintained a constant correspondence with the court of Versailles, in complaisance to which he retarded the operations of the confederates.

<P>The protestant interest in Germany acquired an accession of strength, by the creation of a ninth electorate in favour of Ennest Augustus duke of Hanover. He had, by this time, renounced all his connexions with France, and engaged to enter heartily into the interest of the allies, in consideration of his obtaining the electoral dignity. King William exerted himself so vigorously in his behalf at the court of Vienna, that the emperor agreed to the proposal, in case the consent of the other electors could be procured. This assent, however, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the importunities of the king of England, whom he durst not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> He was blindly bigot<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the religion of Rome, and consequently <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verse to anew creation that would weaken the catholic interest in the electoral college. He therefore employed his e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>issanies to thwart the duke's measures. Some pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estant princes opposed him from motives of jealousy; and the French king used all his artifices and influence to prevent the elevation of the house of Hanover. When the duke had surmounted all this opposition, so far as to gain o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r a majority of the electors, new objections were started. The emperor sug∣gested that another popish electorate should be created, to balance the advantage which the Lutherans would reap from that of Hanover; and he proposed that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be raised to the same dignity: but violent opposition was made to this expedient, which would have vested the emperor with a double vote in the electoral college. At length, after a tedious negotiation, the duke of Han∣over, on the nineteenth day of December, was honoured with the investature as elector of Brunswick; created great marshal of the empire, and did homage to the emperor: nevertheless, he was not yet admitted into the college, because he had not been able to procure the unanimous consent of all the electors <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of September, the shock of onearthquake was selt in London and many other parts of England, as well as in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.

<P>WHILE king William seemed wholly engrossed by the affairs of the continent, England was distracted by domestic dissension, and overspread with vice, corruption, and profanity. Over and above the Jacobites, there was a set of malecontents, whose number daily increased. They not only murmured at the grievances of the nation, but composed and published elabo∣rate dissertations upon the same subject. These made such impressions upon the people, already irritated by heavy burdens, distressed in their trade, and disap∣pointed in their sanguine expectations, that the queen thought it necessary to check the progress of those writers, by issuing out a proclamation offering a reward to such as would discover seditious libellers. The earl of Marl∣borough had been committed to the Tower, on the information of one Robert Young, a prisoner in Newgate, who had forged that nobleman's hand-writing, and contrived the scheme of an association in favour of king James, to which he affixed the names of the earls of Marlborough and Salisbury, Sprat, bishop of Rochester, the lord Cornbury, and Sir Basil Firebrace. One of his emis∣saries had found means to conceal this paper in a certain part of the bishop's house at Bromley in Kent, where it was found by the king's messengers, who secured the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elate in consequence of Young's information. But he vindicated himself to the satisfaction of the whole council, and the forgery of the informer was detected by the confession of his accomplice.

<P>So many persons of character and distinction had been imprisoned du∣ring this reign, upon the slightest suspicion, that the discontented part of the na∣tion had some reason to insinuate, they had only exchanged one tyrant for another. They affirmed, that the Habeas Corpus act was either insufficient to protect the subject from false imprisonment, or had been shamefully misused. They expatiated upon the loss of ships, which had lately fallen a prey to the enemy; the consumption of seamen; the neglect of the fisheries; the interrup∣tion of commerce, in which the nation was supplanted by her allies, as well as invaded by her enemies; the low ebb of the kingdom's treasure exhausted in hiring foreign bottoms, and paying foreign troops to fight foreign quarrels; the slaughter of the best and bravest of their countrymen, whose blood had been lavishly spilt in support of connexions with which they ought to have had no concern. They demonstrated the mischiefs that necessarily arose from the un∣settled state of the nation. They observed that the government could not be duly established, until a solemn declaration should confirm the legality of that tenure by which their majesties possessed the throne; that the structure of par∣liaments was deficient in point of solidity, as they existed intirely at the pleasure of the crown, which would use them no longer than they should be found ne∣cessary in raising supplies for the use of the government. They exclaimed against the practice of quartering soldiers in private houses, contrary to the ancient laws of the land, the petition of rights, and the subsequent act passed in the reign of the second Charles. They enumerated among their grievances the vio∣lation of property, by pressing transport ships into the service, without settling any fund of payment for the owners; the condition of the militia, which was equally burthensome and useless; the flagrant partiality in favour of allies, who
<PB N="93" REF="960"/>
carried on an open commerce with France, and supplied the enemy with neces∣saries, while the English laboured under the severest prohibitions, and were in effect the dupes of those very powers whom they protected. They dwelt upon the ministry's want of conduct, foresight, and intelligence, and inveighed against their ignorance, insolence, and neglect, which were as pernicious to the nation as if they had formed a design of reducing it to the lowest ebb of disgrace and destruction. By this time indeed, public virtue was become the object of ridi∣cule, and the whole kingdom was overspread with immorality and corruption; towards the increase of which many concurring circumstances happened to con∣tribute. The people were divided into three parties, namely, the Williamites, the Jacobites, and the discontented revolutioners; and these factions took all oppor∣tunities to thwart, to expose, and to ridicule the measures and principles of each other: so that patriotism was laughed out of doors, as an hypocrital pretence. This contention established a belief, that every man consulted his own private interest at the expence of the public: a belief that soon grew into a maxim almost uni∣versally adopted. The practice of bribing a majority in parliament had a per∣nicious influence upon the morals of all ranks of people from the candi∣date to the lowest borough-elector. The expedient of establishing funds of credit for raising supplies to defray the expence of government, threw large pre∣miums and sums of money into the hands of low, sordid usurers, brokers, and jobbers, who distinguished themselves by the name of the Monied interest. In∣toxicated by this flow of wealth, they affected to rival the luxury and magnifi∣cence of their superiors; but, being destitute of sentiment and taste, to con∣duct them in their new career, they ran into the most absurd and illiberal extra∣vagancies. They layed aside all decorum; became lewd, insolent, intemperate, and riotous. Their example was caught by the vulgar. All principle, and even decency was gradually banished; talent lay uncultivated, and the land was deluged with a tide of ignorance and prosligacy.</P>

He received a congratulatory address from the lord-mayor and aldermen, with whom he dined in public by invitation. A day of thanksgiving was appointed for the victory obtained at sea. The lutestring company was established by patent, and the parliament met on the fourth day of November. The house of lords was deeply infected with discontent, which in some measure proceeded from the dissension between the queen and her sister the princess of Denmark, who under∣went every mortification that the court could inflict. Her guards were taken away; all honours which had been payed to her rank by the magistrates of Bath, where she sometimes resided; and even by the ministers of the church where she attended at divine service, were discontinued, by the express order of her majesty. Her cause was naturally espoused by those noblemen who had ad∣hered to her in her former contest with the king, about an independent settle∣ment; and these were now reinforced by all the friends of the earl of Marlbo∣rough, united by a double tie; for, they resented the disgrace and confinement of that lord; and thought it their duty to support the princess Anne under a
<PB N="94" REF="970"/>
persecution incurred by an attachment to his countess. The earl of Shrewsbury lived in friendship with Marlborough, and thought he had been ungratefully treated by the king; the marquis of Hallifax befriended him, from opposition to the min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stry; the earl of Mulgrave, for an opportunity to display his talents, and acquire that consideration which he thought due to his merit. Devonshire, Montague, and Bradford joined in the same cause, from principle; and the same pretence was used by the earls of Stamford, Monmouth, Warrington, and other Whigs; though in effect they were actuated by jealousy and resentment against those by whom they had been supplanted. As for the Jacobites, they gladly con∣tributed their assistance to promote any scheme that had a tendency to embroil the administration.</P>

<P>The king, in his speech to parliament, thanked them for their last sup∣plies, congratulated them upon the victory obtained at sea, condoled them on the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d success of the campaign by land, magnified the power of France, re∣presented the necessity of maintaining a great force to oppose it; and demanded sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dies equal to the occasion. He expressed his reluctance to load them with additional burthens, which, he said, could not be avoided without exposing his kingdom to inevitable destruction. He desired their advice towards lessening the inconvenience of exporting money for the payment of the forces. He inti∣mated a design of making a descent upon France; declared he had no aim but to make them a happy people; and that he would again chearfully expose his life for the welfare of the nation. The lords, after an adjournment of three days, began with great warmth to assert their privileges, which they conceived had been violated in the cases of the earl of Marlborough, and the other noble∣men, who had been apprehended, committed to prison, and afterwards admitted to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il by the court of king's-bench. These circumstances being fully discussed in a violent debate, the house order<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d lord Lucas constable of the Tower, to produce the warrants of commitment, and the clerk of the king's-bench to de∣liver the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idavit of Aaron Smith, the court-sollicitor, upon which the lords had been remanded to prison. At the same time, the whole affair was referred to a committee, impowered to send for p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsons, papers, and reco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds. The judges were ordered to attend: Aaron Smith was examined touching the evidence against the committed lords. The committee reported their general resolution, which produced a vehement dispute. The opinion of the judges was unsatis∣factory to both parties: the debate was referred to a committee of the whole house, in which it was resolved, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clared, as the sense of that assembly, that in pursuance of the Habeas-corpus act, it was the duty of the judges and goal∣delivery, to discharge the prisoner on bail, if committed for high-treason, unless it be made appear, upon oath, that there are two witness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s against the said pri∣soner, who cannot be produced in that term, sessions, or general goal-delivery. They likewise resolved, it was the intention of the said statute, that in case there should be more than one prisoner to be bailed or remanded, there must be oath made, that there are two witnesses against each prisoner, otherwise he cannot be remanded to prison. These resolutions were entered in the books, as standing directions to all future judges, yet not without great opposition from the court∣members. The next debate turned upon the manner in which the imprisoned lords should be set at liberty. The contest became so warm, that the courtiers began to be afraid, and proposed an expedient, which was put in practice.
<PB N="95" REF="980"/>
The house adjourned to the seventeenth day of the month, and at its next meet∣ing was given to understand, that the king had discharged the imprisoned noble∣men. After another warm debate, a formal entry was made in the journals, importing, That the house being informed of his majesty's having given di∣rections for discharging the lords under bail in the king's-bench, the debate about that matter ceased. The resentment of the peers being thus allayed, they proceeded to take his majesty's speech into c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsideration.</P>

<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The commons having voted an address of thanks, and another, praying that his majesty's foreign alliances should be layed before them, voted a bill for regulating trials in cases of high treason. They passed a vote of thanks to admiral Russel, his officers and seamen, for the victory they had obtained; then proceeded to an inquiry, Why that victory had not been pursued? Why the descent had not been made? And why the trade had not been better pro∣tected from the enemy's cruisers? The admiral having justified his own con∣duct, they commanded the lords of the admiralty to produce copies of all the letters and orders which had been sent to the admiral: they ordered Russel to lay before them his answers; and the commissioners of the transports, victuallers, and office of ordnance, to deliver in an account of their proceed∣ings. Then they presented addresses to the king and queen, acknowledging the favour of God in restoring him to his people; congratulating him upon his deliverance from the snares of his open and secret enemies; and assuring him they would, according to his majesty's desire in his most gracious speech, be always ready to advise and assist him in the support of his government. The queen was thanked for her gracious and prudent administration during his majesty's absence: they congratulated her on their signal deliverance from a bold and cruel design formed for their destruction, as well as on the glorious victory which her fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t had gained; and they assured her that the grateful sense they had of their happiness under her government, should always be manifested in constant returns of duty and obedience.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>After this formal compliment, the house, instead of proceeding to the supplies, insisted upon perusing the treaties, public accounts, and esti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates, that they might be in a condition to advise, as well as to assist his majesty. Being indulged with those papers, they passed a previous vote, that a supply should be given; then they began to concert their articles of advice. Some of the members loudly complained of partiality to foreign generals; and par∣ticularly reflected upon the insolence of count Solmes, and his misconduct at Steenkirk. After some warm altercation, the house resolved one article of their advice should be, That his majesty would be pleased to fill up such va∣cancies as should happen among the general officers, with such only as were natives of his dominions; and that the commander in chief of the English should be an Englishman. Their next resolution implied, That many of the great affairs of the government having been for some time past unsuccessfully managed, the house should advise his majesty to prevent such mischiefs for the future, by employing men of knowledge, ability, and integrity. Individual members inveighed bitterly against cabinet councils, as a novelty in the British system of government, by which the privy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>council was justled out of its pro∣vince. They complained that all the grievances of the nation proceeded from the vitious principles of the ministry: they observed, that he who opposed the
<PB N="96" REF="990"/>
establishment, could not be expected to support it with zeal. The earl of Nottingham was mentioned by name; and the house resolved that his majesty should be advised, to employ in his councils such persons only whose prin∣ciples obliged them to support his rights against the late king, and all other pretenders. Marlborough's interest still predominated among the commons. His friend Russel acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the house, and shifted the blame of the miscarriage upon his enemy the earl of Nottingham, by declaring that twenty days elapsed between his first letter to that nobleman and his lordship's answer. The earl's friends, of whom there was a great number in the house, espoused his cause with great vigour, and even recri∣minated upon Russel; so that a very violent debate ensued. Both parties agreed that there had been mismanagement in the scheme of a descent. It was moved, that one cause of the miscarriage was the want of giving timely and necessary orders, by those to whom the management of the affair was com∣mitted. The house divided, and it was carried in the affirmative by one voice only. At the next sitting of the committee, Sir Richard Temple proposed they should consider how to pay the forces abroad, by means of English manufactures, without exporting money. They resolved that the house should be moved to appoint a committee to take this expedient into consideration. Sir Francis Winnington was immediately called upon to leave the chair; and the speaker resumed his place. All that had been done was now void, as no report had been made; and the committee was dissolved. The house, however, revived it, and appointed a day for its sitting; but, before it could resume its delibe∣rations, admiral Russel moved for its being adjourned, and all its purposes were defeated.</P>

<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The court agents had by this time interposed, and secured a ma∣jority by the infamous arts of corruption. The commons no longer insisted upon their points of advice. Their whole attention was now centered in the article of assistance. They granted about two millions for the maintenance of three and thirty thousand seamen, the building of some additional ships of war, and the finishing of Plymouth-dock; and seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds to supply the deficiency of the quarterly poll. The estimates of the land-service were not discussed without tedious debates, and warm disputes. The ministry demanded fifty-four thousand men, twenty thousand of whom should be kept at home for the defence of the nation, while the rest should serve abroad in the allied army. Many members declared their aversion to a foreign war, in which the nation had no immediate concern, and so little pros∣pect of success. Others agreed that the allies should be assisted on the conti∣nent with a proportion of British forces; but that the nation should act as auxiliary, not as a principal, and pay no more than what the people would chearfully contribute to the general expence. These reflections, however, pro∣duced no other effect than that of prolonging the debate. Ministerial influ∣ence had surmounted all opposition. The house voted the number of men demanded. Such was their servile complaisance, that when they examined the treaties by which the English and Dutch contracted equally with the German princes, and found that, notwithstanding these treaties, Britain bore two-thirds of the expence, they overlooked this flagrant instance of par∣tiality, and enabled the king to pay the proportion. Nay, their maxims
<PB N="97" REF="1000"/>
were so much altered, that, instead of prosecuting their resentment against fo∣reign generals, they assented to a motion that the prince of Wirtemberg, the major generals Tetteau and La Forest, who commanded the Danish troops in the pay of the states-general, should be indulged with such an addition to their appointments as would make up the difference between the pay of Eng∣land and that of Holland. Finally, they voted above two millions for the sub∣sistence of the land-forces, and for defraying extraordinary expences attending the war upon the continent, including subsidies to the electors of Saxony and Hanover.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The house of lords, mean while, was not free from animosity and contention. The Marlborough faction exerted themselves with great vivacity. They affirmed it was the province of their house to advise the sovereign: like the commons, they insisted upon the king's having asked their advice, because he had mentioned that word in his speech, though he never dreamed they would catch at it with such eagerness. They moved, that the task of digesting the articles of advice, should be undertaken by a joint committee of both houses: but all the dependents of the court, including the whole bench of bishops, except Watson of St. David's, were marshalled to oppose this mo∣tion, which was rejected by a majority of twelve; and this victory was fol∣lowed with a protest of the vanquished. Notwithstanding this defeat, they prosecuted their scheme of giving advice; and, after much wrangling and de∣clamation, the house agreed in an address or remonstrance, advising and be∣seeching his majesty, That the commanding officer of the British forces should be an Englishman: That English officers might take rank of those in the confe∣derate armies, who did not belong to crowned heads: That the twenty thousand men to be left for the defence of the kingdom, should be all English, and com∣manded by an English general: That the practice of pressing men for the fleet should be remedied; and such officers as were guilty of that practice should be ca∣shiered and punished: And, lastly, That no foreigners should sit at the board of ordnance. This address was presented to the king, who received it coldly, and said he would take it into consideration.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>Then the lords resolved to inquire into the miscarriage of the purposed descent, and called for all the papers relating to that affair: but the aim of the majority was not so much to rectify the errors of the government, as to skreen Nottingham, and censure Russel. That nobleman produced his own book of entries, together with the whole correspondence between him and the ad∣miral, whom he verbally charged with having contributed to the miscarriage of the expedition. This affair was referred to a committee. Sir John Ashby was examined. The house directed the earl to draw up the substance of his charge; and these papers were afterwards delivered to a committee of the commons, at a conference, by the lord president and the rest of the com∣mittee above. They were offered for the inspection of the commons, as they concerned some members of that house, by whom they might be informed more fully of the particulars they contained. At another conference, which the commons demanded, their committee declared, in the name of the house, That they had read and well considered the papers which their lordships had sent them, and which they now returned: That, finding Mr. Russel one of their members, often mentioned in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid papers, they
<PB N="98" REF="1010"/>
had unanimously resolved, That admiral Russel, in his command of the fleets, during the last <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummer's expedition, had behaved with fidelity, courage, and conduct. The lords, irritated at this declaration, and disappointed in their resentment against Russel, desired a free conference between the committees of both houses, in which the earl of Rochester told the commons, he was com∣manded by the house of lords to inform them, that their lordships looked upon the late vote and proceedings of the lower house, in returning their papers, to be irregular and unparliamentary, as they had not communicated to their lordships the lights they had received, and the reasons upon which their vote was founded. A paper to the same purport was delivered to colonel Granville, who promised to present it to the commons, and make a faithful re∣port of what his lordship had said. Thus the conference ended, and the in∣quiry was discontinued.</P>

<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>The lower house seemed to be as much exasperated against the earl of Nottingham as the lords were incensed at Russel. A motion was made, that his majesty should be advised to appoint such commissioners of the board of admiralty as were of known experience in maritime affairs. Although this was over-ruled, they voted an address to the king, praying, that for the future, all orders for the management of the fleet, might pass through the hands of the said commissioners; a protest by implication against the conduct of the secretary. The consideration of ways and means was the next object that engro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied the attention of the lower house. They resolved that a rate of four shillings in the pound, for one year, should be charged upon all lands, according to their yearly value; as also upon all personal estates, and upon all offices and employments of profit, other than military offices in the army or navy. The act founded on this resolution impowered the king to borrow money on the credit of it, at seven per cent. They further enabled him to raise one million on the general credit of the exchequer, by granting annuities. They laid several new duties on a variety of imports. They renewed the last quarterly poll, providing, that in case it did not produce three hundred thousand pounds, the deficiencies might be made up by borrowing on the general credit of the exchequer. They continued the impositions on wine, vinegar, tobacco, and sugar, for five years; and those on East India goods for four years. They laid a new imposition of eight per cent on the capital stock of the East India company, estimated at seven hundred and forty-four thousand pounds; of one per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the African; of five pounds on every share of the stock be∣longing to the Hudson's bay company; and they impowered his majesty to borrow five hundred thousand pounds on these funds, which were expressly established for maintaining the war with vigour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French king hearing how liberally William was supplied, exclaimed with some emo∣tion, "My little cousin the prince of Orange is fixed in the saddle—but, no matter, the las<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Louis d'or must carry it."</NOTE>.</P>

<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The money-bills were retarded in the upper-house, by the arts of Hal∣lifax, Mulgrave, and other malecontents. They grafted a clause on the land-tax bill, importing, that the lords should tax themselves. It was adopted by the majority, and the bill sent with this amendment to the commons, by whom it was unanimously rejected, as a flagrant attempt upon their privileges. They demanded a conference, in which they declared, that the clause in question was
<PB N="99" REF="1020"/>
a notorious encroachment upon the right the commons possessed, of regulating all matters relating to supplies granted by parliament. When this report was debated in the house of lords, the earl of Mulgrave displayed uncommon powers of eloquence and argument, in persuading the house, that by yielding to this claim of the commons, they would divest themselves of their true great∣ness, and nothing would remain but the name and shadow of a peer, which was but a pageant. Notwithstanding all his oratory, the lords relinquished their clause, declaring, at the same time, that they had agreed to pass the bill without alteration, merely in regard to the present urgent state of affairs, as being otherwise of opinion, that they had a right to insist upon their clause. A formal complaint being made in the house of commons against the pamphlet intitled, King William and Queen Mary Conquerors, as containing assertions of dangerous consequence to their majesties, to the liberty of the subject, and the peace of the kingdom; the licenser and prin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er were taken into custody. The book being examined, they resolved that it should be burned by the hands of the common hangman; and, that the king should be moved to dismiss the licenser from his employment. The same sentence they pronounced upon a pastoral letter of bishop Burnet, in which this notion of conquest had been at first asserted. The lords, in order to manifest their sentiments on the same subject, resolved, That such an assertion was highly injurious to their majesties, inconsistent with the principles on which the government was founded, and tending to the subversion of the rights of the people. Bohun the licenser was brought to the bar of the house, and discharged upon his own petition, after having been reprimanded on his knees by the speaker.</P>

<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">

<P>Several members having complained that their servants had been kidnapped, and sent to serve as soldiers in Flanders, the house appointed a committee to enquire into the abuses committed by press-masters; and a suitable remonstrance was presented to the king, who expressed his indignation at this practice, and assured the house that the delinquents should be brought to ex∣emplary punishment. Understanding, however, in the sequel, that the methods taken by his majesty for preventing this abuse had not proved effectual, they resumed their inquiry, and proceeded with uncommon vigour on the informa∣tion they received. A great number of persons who had been pressed, were discharged by order of the house; and captain Winter, the chief undertaker for this method of recruiting the army, was carried by the serjeant before the lord chief justice, that he might be prosecuted according to law.</P>

<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Before the heats occasioned by this unpopular expedient were al∣layed, the discontent of the nation was further inflamed by complaints from Ireland, where lord Sidney was said to rule with despotic authority. These complaints were exhibited by Sir Francis Brewster, Sir William Gore, Sir John Macgill, lieutenant Stafford, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Kerne. They were examined at the bar of the house, and delivered an account of their grievances in writing. Both houses concurred in this inquiry, which being finished, they severally presented addresses to the king. The lords observed, That there had been great abuses in disposing of the forseited estates: That protections had been granted to the Irish not included in the articles of Limerick; so that protestants were deprived of the benefit of the law against them: That the quarters of the army had not been payed according to the provision made by
<PB N="100" REF="1030"/>
parliament: That a mayor had been imposed upon the city of Dublin for two years successively, contrary to the antient privileges and charter: That several persons accused of m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rder had been executed without proof; and one Sweet∣man, the most guilty, discharged without prosecution. The commons spoke more freely in their address; they roundly explained the abuses and mismanage∣ment of that government, by exposing the protestant subjects to the free quarter and violence of a licentious army; by recruiting the troops with Irish papists, who had been in open rebellion against his majesty; by granting pro∣te<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tions to Irish roman catholics, whereby the course of the law was stopped; by revers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng outlawries for high treason, not comprehended in the articles of Limerick; by letting the forfeited estates at under value, to the prejudice of his majesty's revenue; by embezzling the stores left in the towns and garri∣sons by the late king James, as well as the effects belonging to forfeited estates, which might have been employed for the better preservation of the kingdom; and, finally, by making additions to the articles of Limerick, after the capitulation was signed, and the place surrendered. They most humbly besought his majesty to redress these abuses, which had greatly encouraged the papists, and weakened the protestant interest in Ireland. The king graciously received both addresses, and promised to pay a particular regard to all re∣monstrances that should come from either house of parliament: but no ma∣terial step was taken against the lords Sidney, Athlone, and Coningsby, who appeared to have engrossed great part of the forfeitures by grants from the crown; and even commissioner Culliford, who had been guilty of the most grievous acts of oppression, escaped with impunity.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The old Whig principle was not yet wholly expelled from the lower-house. The undue influence of the court was exerted in such an open scandalous manner, as gave offence to the majority of the commons. In the midst of all their condescension, Sir Edward Hussey, member for Lin∣coln, brought in a bill touching free and impartial proceedings in parlia∣ment. It was intended to disable all members of parliament from enjoying places of trust and profit, and particularly levelled against the officers of the army and navy, who had insinuated themselves into the house in such num∣bers, that this was commonly called the officers parliament. The bill passed the house of commons, and was sent up to the lords, by whom it was read a second time, and committed; but the ministry employing their whole strength against it, on the report it was thrown out by a majority of two voices. The earl of Mulgrave again distinguished himself by his elocution, in a speech that was held in great veneration by the people; and, among those who entered a protest in the journals of the house, when the majority rejected the bill, was prince George of Denmark, duke of Cumberland. The court had not re∣collected themselves from the consternation produced by such a vigorous op∣position, when the earl of Shrewsbury produced another bill for triennial par∣liaments, providing that there should be an annual session; that if, at the ex∣piration of the three years, the crown should not order the writs to be issued, the lord chancellor, or keeper, or commissioner of the great seal, should issue them ex officio, and by authority of this act, under severe penalties. The immediate object of this bill was the dissolution of the present parliament, which had already sat three sessions, and began to be formidable to the people,
<PB N="101" REF="1040"/>
from its concessions to the ministry. The benefits that would accrue to the constitution from the establishment of triennial parliaments were very well un∣derstood, as these points had been frequently discussed in former reigns. The courtiers now objected, that frequent elections would render the freeholders proud and insolent, encourage faction among the electors, and intail a con∣tinual expence upon the member, as he would find himself obliged, during the whole time of his sitting, to behave like a candidate, conscious how soon the time of election would revolve. In spite of the ministerial interest in the upper-house, the bill passed, and contained a proviso, that the present parlia∣ment should not continue any longer than the month of January next ensuing. The court renewed its efforts against it in the house of commons, where, nevertheless, it was carried, with some little alterations, which the lords ap∣proved. But all these endeavours were frustrated by the prerogative of the king, who, by refusing his assent, prevented its being enacted into a law.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>It was at the instigation of the ministry, that the commons brought in a bill for continuing and explaining certain temporary laws then expiring or expired. Among these was an act for restraining the liberty of the press, which owed its origin to the reign of Charles II. and had been revived in the first year of the succeeding reign. The bill passed the lower house without difficulty, but met with warm opposition in the house of lords, a good number of whom protested against it, as a law that subjected all learning and true in∣formation to the arbitrary will of a mercenary, and perhaps ignorant licenser, destroyed the properties of authors, and extended the evil of monopolies. The bill for regulating trials was dropped, and, in lieu of it, another pro∣duced for the preservation of their majesties sacred persons and government; but this too was rejected by the majority, in consequence of the ministry's se∣cret management. The East India company narrowly escaped dissolution. Petitions and counter-petitions were delivered into the house of commons: the pretensions on both sides were carefully examined: a committee of the whole house resolved, that there should be a new subscription of a joint-stock, not exceeding two millions five hundred thousand pounds, to continue for one and twenty years. The report was made and received, and the public expected to see the affair brought to a speedy issue: but the company had re∣course to the same expedients, which had lately proved so successful in the hands of the ministry. Those who had been the most warm in detecting their abuses, suddenly cooled; and the prosecution of the affair began to languish. Not but that the house presented an address to his majesty, praying that he would dissolve the company upon three years warning, according to the con∣dition of their charter. He told them he would consider their address; and they did not further urge their remonstrance. The bill for ascertaining the commissions and salaries of the judges, to which the king had refused the royal assent in the last session, was revived, twice read, and rejected; and another, for preventing the exportation and melting of the coin, they suffered to lie neglected on the table. On the fourteenth day of March, the king put an end to the session, after having thanked the parliament for so great testimo∣nies of their affection, and promised the supplies should not be misapplied. He observed, that the posture of affairs called him abroad; but that he would leave a sufficient number of troops for the security of the kingdom: he assured
<PB N="102" REF="1050"/>
them he would expose his person upon all occasions for the advantage of these kingdoms; and use his utmost endeavours to make them a flourishing nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The other laws made in this session were these that follow. An act for preventing suits against such as had acted for their majesties service in defence of this kingdom. An act for raising the militia in the year 1693.

<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>During the course of this session, lord Mohun was indicted and tried by his peers, in Westminster-hall, as an accomplice in the murder of one Mont∣ford, a celebrated comedian, the marquis of Carmarthen acting as lord-steward upon this occasion. The judges having been consulted, the peers proceeded to give their judgments seriatim, and Mohun was acquitted by a great majority. The king, who, from his first accession to the throne, had endeavoured to trim the balance between the Whigs and Tories, by mingling them together in his ministry, made some alterations at this period, that savoured of the same po∣licy. The great-seal, with the title of lord-keeper, was bestowed upon Sir John Somers, who was well skilled in the law, as in many other branches of polite and useful literature. He possessed a remarkable talent for business, in which he exerted great patience and assiduity; was gentle, candid, and equi∣table; a Whig in principles, yet moderate, pacific, and conciliating. Of the same temper was Sir John Trenchard, now appointed secretary of state. He had been concerned with the duke of Monmouth, and escaped to the continent, where he lived some years; was calm, sedate, well acquainted with foreign af∣fairs, and considered as a leading man in his party. These two are said to have been promoted at the recommendation of the earl of Sunderland, who had by this time insinuated himself into the king's favour and confidence; though his success confirmed the opinion which many entertained, of his having betrayed his old master. The leaders of the opposition, were Sir Edward Seymour, again become a malcontent, and Sir Christopher Musgrave, a gentleman of Cumber∣land, who, though an extravagant Tory from principle, had refused to concur with all the designs of the late king.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1693.</NOTE> The king having visited the fleet and fortifications of Portsmouth, given instructions for annoying the enemy by sea, and left the administration in the hands of the queen, embarked on the last day of March, near Gravesend, and arrived in Holland on the third of April. The troops of the confede∣rates were forthwith ordered to assemble; but while he was employed in making preparations for the campaign, the French king actually took the field, attended by madame de Maintenon, and all the court ladies. His design was supposed to be upon some town in Brabant: his army amounted to one hundred and twenty thousand men, completely armed, and abundantly supplied with all ne∣cessaries for every sort of military operation. King William immediately took possession of the strong camp at Parke near Louvain, a situation which enabled him to cover the places that were most exposed. Understanding that the French emissaries had sown the seeds of dissension between the bishop and chapter of Liege, he sent the duke of Wirtemberg thither, to reconcile the different par∣ties, and concert measures for the further security of the place. He reinforced the garrison with nine battalions; and the elector palatine lay with his troops in readiness to march to its relief. William likewise threw reinforcements into Maestricht, Huy, and Charleroy; and he himself resolved to remain on the de∣fensive, at the head of sixty thousand men, with a numerous train of ar∣tillery.</P>

<P>Lewis having reviewed his army at Gemblours, and seen his designs upon Brabant defeated by the diligence of his antagonist, detached Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lers with twenty thousand men to the Upper Rhine, to join the dauphin, who com∣manded in that quarter; then leaving the conduct of his forces in the Nether∣lands to the duke de Luxembourg, the returned with his court to Versailles. Immediately after his departure, Luxembourg fixed his head-quarters at Mil∣dert; and king William strengthened his camp on that side with ten battalions, and eight and twenty pieces of cannon. The enemy's convoys were frequently surprised by detachments from the garrison of Charleroy; and a large body of horse, foot, and dragoons, being draughted out of Liege and Maestricht, took post at Huy, under the command of the count de Tilly, so as to straiten the French in their quarters. These, however, were dislodged by Luxembourg in person, who obliged the count to pass the Jaar with precipitation, leaving behind three squadrons and all his baggage, which fell into the hands of the enemy. This check, however, was ballanced by the success of the duke of Wirtemberg, who, at the head of thirteen battalions of infantry, and twenty squadrons of horse, forced the French lines between the Schelde and the Lys; and layed the whole country as far as Lisle under contribution. On that very day, which was the eighteenth of July, Luxembourg marched towards Huy, which was next morning invested by M. de Villeroy. The other covered the siege, and secured himself from the allies by lines of contravallation. Before their batteries began to play, the town capitulated. On the twenty-third day of the month, the garrison mutinied; the castles were surrendered; the governor
<PB N="104" REF="1070"/>
remained a prisoner; and his men were conducted to Liege. The confede∣rate army advanced in order to relieve the town; but the king being apprized of its fate, detached ten battalions to reinforce the garrison of Liege, and next day returned to Neer-Hespen.</P>

<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Luxembourg made a motion towards Liege, as if he had in∣tended to besiege the place; and encamped at Hellecheim, about seven leagues from the confederates. Knowing how much they were weakened by the different detachments which had been made from their army, he resolved to attack them in their camp, or at least fall upon their rear, should they retreat at his approach. On the twenty-eight day of July, he began his march in four columns, and passed the Jaar near its source, with an army superior to the allies by five and thirty thousand men. The king of England, at first, looked upon this motion as a feint to cover the design upon Liege; but receiving intelligence that their whole army was in full march to attack him in his camp, he resolved to keep his ground; and immediately drew up his forces in order of battle. His general-officers advised him to repass the Geet; but he chose to risque a battle, rather than expose the rear of his army in repassing that river. His right wing extended as far as Neer-Winden, along the Geet, covered with hedges, hollow-ways, and a small rivulet: the left reached to Neer-Landen; and these two villages were joined by a slight intrenchment, which the king or∣dered to be thrown up in the evening. Brigadier Ramsey, with the regiments of Ofarrel, Mackay, Lauder, Leven, and Monroe, were ordered to the right of the whole army, to line some hedges and hollow-ways, on the farther side of the village of Lare. Six battalions of Brandenburgh were posted to the left of this village; and general Dumont with the Hanoverian infantry, possessed the vil∣lage of Neer-Winden, which covered part of the camp, between the main body and the right wing of the cavalry. Neer-Landen on the left, was secured by six battalions of English, Danes, and Dutch. The remaining infantry was drawn up in one line behind the intrenchment. The dragoons upon the left guarded the village of Dormal upon the brook of Beck; and from thence the left wing of horse extended to Neer-Landen, where it was covered by this rivulet.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>The king having visited all the posts on horseback, and given the necessary orders, reposed himself about two hours in his coach; and early in the morning sent for his chaplain, whom he joined in prayer with great devo∣tion. At sun-rising the enemy appeared drawn up in order of battle; and the allies began to play their cannon with good success. About eight in the morn∣ing they attacked the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden with great fury; and twice made themselves masters of these posts, from whence they were as often repulsed. At length, the allies kept their ground; and, the duke of Berwick was taken by his uncle brigadier Churchill. Then the French made an attack upon the left wing of the confederates at Neer-Landen; and after a very ob∣stinate dispute, were obliged to give way, though they still kept possession of the avenues. The prince of Conti, however, renewed the charge with the flower of the French infantry; and the confederates being overpowered, retreated from the village, leaving the camp in that part exposed. Villeroy marching this way with a body of horse, was encountered and repulsed by the count D'Arco, ge∣neral of the Bavarian cuirassiers; and the duke de Chartres narrowly escaped being taken. Mean while, Luxembourg, the prince of Conti, the count de Marsin,
<PB N="105" REF="1080"/>
and the marechal de Joyeuse, charged on the right, and in different parts of the line, with such impetuosity as surmounted all resistance. The camp of the confederates was immediately filled with French troops: the villages of Lare and Neer-Winden were taken, after a long and desperate dispute. The Hano∣verian and Dutch horse being broken, the king in person brought the English cavalry to their assistance. They fought with great gallantry; and for some time retarded the fate of the day. The infantry was rallied, and stood firm until all their ammunition was expended. In a word, they were scarce able to sustain the weight of such a superiority in point of number, when the marquis D'Harcourt joined the enemy from Huy, with two and twenty fresh squadrons, which immediately turned the scale in their favour. The elector of Bavaria, after having made extraordinary efforts, retreated with great difficulty over the bridge to the other side of the river, where he rallied the troops, in order to favour the retreat of those who had not passed. The king seeing the battle lost, and the whole army in confusion, retired with the infantry to Dormal on the brook of Beck, where the dragoons of the left wing were posted. Then he ordered the regiments of Wyndham, Lumley, and Galway, to cover his retreat over the bridge at Neer-Hespen, which he effected with great difficulty. Now all was tumult, rout, and consternation; and a great number of the fugitives threw themselves into the river, where they were drowned. This had like to have been the fate of the brave earl of Athlone; the duke of Ormond was wounded in several places, and taken prisoner by the enemy; and the count de Solmes was mortally wounded. Talmash brought off the greater part of the English infantry with great gallantry and conduct: as for the baggage, it had been sent to Liege before the engagement: but, the confederates lost sixty pieces of cannon, and nine mortars, a great number of standards and colours <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The duke of Luxembourg sent such a num∣ber of standards and ensigns to Paris, during the course of this war, that the prince of Conti called him the Upholsterer of Notre-Dame, a church in which those trophies were displayed.</NOTE>, with about seven thousand men killed and wounded in the action. It must be owned that the allies fought with great valour and perseverance; and that king William made prodigious efforts of courage and activity to retrieve the fortune of the day. He was present in all parts of the battle; he charged in person both on horseback and a-foot, where the danger was most imminent. His p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ruke, the sleeve of his coat, and the knot of his scarf were penetrated by three different musket-bullets; and he saw a great number of soldiers fall on every side of him. The enemy bore witness to his extraordinary valour. The prince of Conti, in a letter to his princess, which was intercepted, declared, that he saw the prince of Orange exposing himself to the greatest dangers; and that such val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur richly deserved the peaceable possession of the crown he wore. Yet here, as in every other battle he fought, his conduct and disposition were severely cen∣sured. Luxembourg having observed the nature of his situation immediately before the engagement, is said to have exclaimed, <Q>“Now I believe Waldeck is really dead;”</Q> alluding to that general's known sagacity in choosing ground for an encampment. Be that as it will, he payed dear for his victory. His loss in officers and men exceeded that of the allies; and he reaped no solid ad∣vantage from the battle. He remained fifteen days inactive at Waren, while king William recalling the duke of Wirtemberg, and draughting troops from Liege and other garrisons, was in a few days able to hazard another engagement.</P>

<P>Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of the campaign, until Luxembourg being rejoined by Boufflers with a strong rein∣forcement from the Rhine, invested Charleroy. He had taken his measures with such caution and dexterity, that the allies could not frustrate his opera∣tions, without attacking his lines at a great disadvantage. The king detached the elector of Bavaria and the duke of Wirtemberg, with thirty battalions and forty squadrons, to make a diversion in Flanders; but, they returned in a few days, without having attempted any thing of consequence. The garrison of Charleroy defended the place with surprising valour, from the tenth of Sep∣tember to the eleventh of October, during which period they had repulsed the assailants in several attacks: but, at length, despairing of relief, the governor capitulated on the most honourable conditions; and the reduction of the place was celebrated with a Te Deum, and other rejoicings at Paris. Lewis, however, in the midst of all his glory, was extremely mortified when he reflected upon the little advantage he had reaped from all his late victories. The allies had been defeated successively at Fleurus, Steenkirk, and Landen; but in a fortnight after each of those battles, William was always in a condition to risque another engagement. Formerly Lewis had conquered half of Holland, Flanders, and Franche-Comte, without a battle; whereas now he could not with his utmost efforts, and after the most signal victories, pass the frontiers of the United-Pro∣vinces. The conquest of Charleroy concluded the campaign in the Nether∣lands; and both armies went into winter-quarters.</P>

<P>The French army on the Rhine, under De Lorges, passed that river in the month of May, at Philipsburg, and invested the city of Heidelberg which they took, plundered, and reduced to ashes. This general committed number∣less barbarities in the Palatinate, which he ravaged without even sparing the tombs of the dead. The French soldiers, on this occasion, seem to have been actuated by the most brutal inhumanity. They butchered the inhabitants, vio∣lated the women, plundered the houses, rifled the churches, and murdered priests at the altar. They broke open the electoral vault, and scattered the ashes of that illustrious family about the streets. They set fire to different quarters of the city; they stripped about fifteen thousand of the inhabitants, without dis∣tinction of age or sex, and drove them naked into the castle, that the garrison might be the sooner induced to capitulate. There they remained like cattle in the open air, without food or covering, tortured between the horrors of their fate and the terrors of a bombardment. When they were set at liberty, in consequence of the fort's being surrendered, a great number of them died along the banks of the Neckar, from cold, hunger, anguish, and despair. These enormous cruelties, which would have disgraced the arms of a Tartarian free∣booter, were acted by the express command of Lewis XIV. of France, who has been celebrated by so many venal pens, not only as the greatest monarch, but also as the most polished prince of Christendom. De Lorges advanced to∣wards the Neckar against the prince of Baden, who lay encamped on the other side of that river: but in attempting to pass, he was twice repulsed with con∣siderable damage. The dauphin joining the army, which now amounted to seventy thousand men, crossed without opposition; but, found the Germans so advantageously posted, that he would not hazard an attack: having therefore repassed the river, he secured Stutgard with a garrison, sent detachments into
<PB N="107" REF="1100"/>
Flanders and Piedmont, and returned in August to Versailles. In Piedmont the allies were still more unfortunate. The duke of Savoy and his confederates seemed bent upon driving the French from Casal and Pignerol. The first of these places was blocked up, and the other actually invested. The fort of St. Bridget that covered the place, was taken, and the town bombarded. Mean while Cati∣nat being reinforced, descended into the plains. The duke was so apprehen∣sive of Turin, that he abandoned the siege of Pignerol, after having blown up the fort, and marched in quest of the enemy to the plain of Marsaglia, in the neighbourhood of his capital. On the fourth day of October, the French advanced upon them from the hills, between Orbasson and Prosasque; and a desperate engagement ensued. The enemy charged the left wing of the confederates sword in hand, with incredible fury; and though they were once repulsed, they renewed the attack with such impetuosity, that the Neapolitan and Milanese horse were obliged to give way, and disor∣dered the German cavalry. These falling upon the foot, threw the whole wing into confusion. Mean while, the main body and the other wing sustained the charge without flinching, until they were exposed in flank by the defeat of the cavalry: then the whole front gave way. In vain the second line was brought up to sustain them: the horse turned their backs, and the infantry was totally routed. In a word, the confederates were obliged to retire with preci∣pitation, leaving their cannon, and about eight thousand men killed or wounded on the field of battle. The duke of Schomberg having been denied the post which was his due, insisted upon fighting at the head of the troops maintained by the king of Great Britain, who were posted in the center; and behaved with great gallantry under the eye of their commander. When the left wing was defeated, the count de los Torres desired he would take upon him the command, and retreat with the infantry and right wing; but, he refused to act without the order of his highness, and said, things were come to such a pass, that they must either conquer or die. He continued to animate his men with his voice and ex∣ample, until he received a shot in the thigh. His valet seeing him fall, ran to his assistance, and called for quarter; but was killed by the enemy before he could be understood. The duke being taken at the same instant, was afterwards dis∣missed upon his parole; and in a few days died at Turin, universally lamented on account of his great and amiable qualities. The earl of Warwick and Hol∣land, who accompanied him as a volunteer, shared his fate in being wounded and taken prisoner; but, he soon recovered his health and liberty. This victory as as unsubstantial as that of Landen, and almost as dear in the purchase; for the confederates made an obstinate defence, and yielded solely to superior num∣ber. The duke of Savoy retreated to Moncalier, and threw a reinforcement into Coni, which Catinat would not venture to besiege; so severely had he been handled in the battle. He therefore contented himself with laying the country under contribution, reinforcing the garrisons of Casal, Pignerol, and Susa; and making preparations for repassing the mountains. The news of the victory no sooner reached Paris, than Lewis dispatched Mr. de Chanlais to Turin, with proposals for detaching the duke of Savoy from the interest of the allies; and the pope, who was now become a partisan of France, supported the negotiation with his whole influence: but the French king had not yet touched upon the right string. The duke continued deaf to all his addresses.</P>

<P>France had been alike successful in her intrigues at the courts of Rome and Constantinople. The vizir at the Porte had been converted into a pensionary and creature of Lewis; but, the war in which the Turks had been so long and unsuccessfully engaged, rendered him so odious to the people, that the grand signor deposed him, in order to appease their clamours. The English and Dutch ambassadors at Constantinople forthwith renewed their mediation for a peace with the emperor; but the terms they proposed were still rejected with disdain. In the mean time, general Heusler, who commanded the Imperialists in Transylvania, reduced the fortresses of Jeno and Villaguswar. In the beginning of July, the duke de Croy assumed the chief command of the German army, passed the Danube and the Saave, and invested Belgrade. The siege was car∣ried on for some time with great vigour; but, at length abandoned at the approach of the vizir, who obliged the Imperialists to repass the Saave, and sent out parties which made incursions into Upper-Hungary. The power of France had never been so conspicuous as at this juncture, when she maintained a for∣midable navy at sea, and four great armies in different parts of Europe. Exclu∣sive of the operations in Flanders, Germany, and Piedmont, the count de Noailles invested Roses in Catalonia, about the latter end of May, while at the same time it was blocked up by the French fleet, under the command of the count D'E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rees. In a few days the place was surrendered by capitulation; and the castle of Ampurias met with the same fate. The Spanish power was reduced to such a degree, that No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illes might have proceeded in his conquests without interruption, had not he been obliged to detach part of his army to reinforce Catinat in Piedmont.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more inglorious for the English than their opera∣tions by sea in the course of this summer. The king had ordered the admirals to use all possible dispatch in equipping the fleets, that they might block up the enemy in their own ports, and protect the commerce, which had suffered severely from the French privateers. They were, however, so dilatory in their proceed∣ings, that the squadrons of the enemy sailed from their harbours before the English fleet could put to sea. About the middle of May it was assembled at St. Helen's, and took on board five regiments, intended for a descent on Brest; but this enterprize was never attempted. When the English and Dutch squa∣drons joined, so as to form a very numerous fleet, the public expected they would undertake some expedition of importance; but the admirals were divided in opinion, nor did their orders warrant their executing any scheme of consequence. Killigrew and Delaval did not escape the suspicion of being disaffected to the service; and France was said to have maintained a secret correspondence with the malcontents in England. Lewis had made surprising efforts to repair the damage which his navy had sustained. He had purchased several large vessels, and converted them into ships of war; he had layed an embargo on all the shipping of his kingdom, until his squadrons were manned: he had made a grand naval promotion, to encourage the officers and seamen; and this expedient produced a wonderful spirit of activity and emulation. In the month of May his fleet sailed to the Mediterranean, in three squadrons, consisting of seventy-one capital ships, besides bomb-ketches, fireships, and tenders.</P>

<P>In the beginning of June, the English and Dutch fleets sailed down the channel. On the sixth, Sir George Rooke was detached to the Streights,
<PB N="109" REF="1120"/>
with a squadron of three and twenty ships, as convoy to the Mediterranean trade. The great fleet returned to Torbay, while he pursued his voyage, hav∣ing under his protection about four hundred merchants ships belonging to Eng∣land, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, and Flanders. On the six∣teenth, his scouts discovered part of the French fleet under Cape St. Vincent: next day their whole navy appeared to the amount of eighty sail. Sixteen of these plied up to the English squadron, while the vice-admiral of the white stood off to sea, to intercept the ships under convoy. Sir George Rooke, by the advice of the Dutch vice-admiral Vaudergoes, resolved, if possible, to avoid an engagement, which could only tend to their absolute ruin. He forthwith sent orders to the small ships that were near the land, to put into the neighbour∣ing ports of Faro, St. Lucar, and Cadiz, while he himself stood off with an easy sail for the protection of the rest. About six in the evening, ten sail of the enemy came up with two Dutch ships of war, commanded by the captains Schrijver and Vander-Poel, who seeing no possibility of escaping, tacked in shore; and thus drawing the French after them, helped to save the rest of the fleet. When attacked they made a most desperate defence; but at last were overpowered by numbers, and taken. An English ship of war, and a rich pin∣nace were burned, nine and twenty merchant-vessels were taken, and about fifty destroyed by the counts de Tourville and D'Estrees. Seven of the largest Smyrna ships fell into the hands of M. de Coetlogon, and four he sunk in the bay of Gibraltar. The value of the loss sustained on this occasion, amounted to one million sterling. Mean while Rooke stood off with a fresh gale, and on the nineteenth sent home the Lark ship of war, with the news of his misfor∣tune; then he bore away for the Maderas, where having taken in wood and water, he set sail for Ireland; and on the third day of August arrived at Cork, with fifty sail, including ships of war and trading vessels. He detached captain Fairborne to Kinsale, with all his squadron, except six ships of the line, with which, in pursuance of orders, he joined the great fleet then cruizing in the chops of the channel. On the twenty-fifth day of August, they returned to St. Helen's, and the four regiments were landed. On the nineteenth day of September, fifteen Dutch ships of the line, and two frigates, set sail for Holland; and twenty-six sail, with seven fireships, were assigned as guard-ships during the winter.</P>

<P>The French admirals, instead of pursuing Rooke to Madera, made an unsuccessful attempt upon Cadiz, and bombarded Gibraltar, where the merchants sunk their ships, that they might not fall into the hands of the enemy. Then they sailed along the coast of Spain, destroyed some English and Dutch vessels at Malaga, Alicant, and other places; and returned in triumph to Toulon. About this period, Sir Francis Wheeler returned to England with his squadron, from an unfortunate expedition in the West-Indies. In conjunc∣tion with colonel Codrington, governor of the Leeward islands, he made un∣successful attempts upon the islands of Martinique and Dominque. Then he sailed to Boston in New-England, with a view to concert an expedition against Quebec, which was judged impracticable. He afterwards steered for Placentia in Newfoundland, which he would have attacked without hesitation; but the design was rejected by a majority of voices in the council of war. Thus disap∣pointed he set sail for England; and arrived at Portsmouth in a very shattered

<P>In November another effort was made to annoy the enemy. Com∣modore Benbow sailed with a squadron of twelve capital ships, four bomb-ketches, and ten brigantines, to the coast of St. Malo, and anchoring within half a mile of the town, c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnonaded and bombarded it for three days successively. Then they landed on an island, where they burned a convent. On the nineteenth, they took the advantage of a dark night, a fresh gale, and a strong tide, to send in a fireship of a particular contrivance, stiled the Infernal, in order to burn the town; but, she struck upon a rock before she arrived at the place, and the engineer was obliged to set her on fire, and retreat. She continued burning for some time, and at last blew up, with such an explosion as shook the whole town like an earthquake, unroofed three hundred houses, and broke all the glass and earthen ware for three leagues around. A cap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tan that weighed two hundred pounds was transported into the place, and falling upon a house, levelled it to the ground; the greatest part of the wall towards the sea tumbled down; and the inhabitants were overwhelmed wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consternation: so that a small number of troops might have taken possession without resistance; but there was not a sol∣dier on board. Nevertheless, the sailors took and demolished Quince-fort, and did considerable damage to the town of St. Malo, which had been a nest of pri∣vateers that infested the English commerce. Though this attempt was executed with great spirit, and some success, the clamours of the people became louder and louder. They scrupled not to say, that the councils of the nation were be∣trayed; and their suspicions ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e even to the secretary's office. They observed, that the French were previously acquainted with all the motions of the Eng∣lish, and took their measures accordingly for their destruction. They collected and compared a good number of particulars, that seemed to justify their suspicion of treachery. But the misfortunes of the nation, in all probability, arose from a motley ministry, divided among themselves, who instead of acting in concert for the public good, employed all their influence to thwart the views, and blacken the reputations of each other. The people in general exclaimed against the marquis of Caermarthen, the earls of Nottingham and Rochester, who had ac∣quired great credit with the queen; and, from their hatred to the Whigs, be∣trayed the interests of the nation.</P>

<P>But if the English were discontented, the French were miserable, in spite of all their victories.

He tampered with the allies apart, in hope of dividing and detaching them from the grand con∣federacy he sollicited the northern crowns to engage as mediators for a general peace. A memorial was actually presented by the Danish minister to king Wil∣liam, by which it appears, that the French king would have been contented to
<PB N="111" REF="1140"/>

<P>The Jacobites had been very attentive to the progress of dissatisfac∣tion in England, which they fomented with their usual assiduity. The late decla∣ration of king James had been couched in such imperious terms as gave offence even to some of those who favoured his interest. The earl of Middleton there∣fore, in the beginning of the year repaired to St. Germain's, and obtained another, which contained the promise of a general pardon without exceptions; and every other concession that a British subject could demand of his sovereign. About the latter end of May, two men, named Canning and Dormer, were apprehended for dispersing copies of this paper, tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty of not only dispersing, but also of composing a false and seditious libel, sentenced to pay five hundred marks a-piece, to stand three times in the pillory, and find sureties for their good behaviour. But, no circumstance reflected more disgrace on this reign, than the fate of Anderton, the supposed printer of some tracts against the government. He was brought to trial for high-treason: he made a vigorous defence, in spite of the insults and discouragements he sustained from a partial bench. As nothing but presumptions appeared against him, the jury scrupled to bring in a verdict that would affect his life, until they were reviled and reprimanded by judge Treby; then they found him guilty. In vain re∣course was had to the queen's mercy: he suffered death at Tyburn; and left a paper, protesting solemnly against the proceedings of the court, which he af∣firmed, was appointed, not to try, but to convict him; and petitioning heaven to forgive his penitent jury. The severity of the government was likewise ex∣emplified in the case of some adventurers, who having equipped privateers to cruize upon the English, under joint-commissions from the late king James and Lewis XIV. happened to be taken by the English ships of war. Dr. Oldys, the king's advocate, being commanded to proceed against them as guilty of treason and pyracy, refused to commence the prosecution; and gave his opinion in writ∣ing, that they were neither traitors nor pyrates. He supported this opinion by arguments before the council, and was answered by Dr. Littleton, who succeeded him in the office, from which he was dismissed; and the prisoners were executed as traitors. The Jacobites did not fail to retort those arts upon the govern∣ment, which their adversaries had so successfully practised in the late reign. They inveighed against the vindictive spirit of the administration, and taxed it with encouraging informers and false witnesses; a charge for which there was too much foundation.</P>

<P>The friends of James in Scotland still continued to concert designs in his favour; but, their correspondence was detected, and their aims defeated, by the vigilance of the ministry in that kingdom. Secretary Johnston not only kept a watchful eye over all their transactions, but by a dextrous management of court∣liberality and favour, appeased the discontents of the presbyterians so effectually, that the king ran no risque in assembling the parliament. Some offices were be∣stowed upon the leaders of the kirk-party; and the duke of Hamilton being recon∣ciled to the government, was appointed commissioner. On the eighteenth day of April, the session was opened, and the king's letter, replete with the most cajoling
<PB N="112" REF="1150"/>
expressions, being read, the parliament proceeded to exhibit undeniable specimens of their good humour. They drew up a very affectionate answer to his ma∣jesty's letter: They voted an addition of six new regiments to the standing forces of the kingdom: They granted a supply of above one hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling to his majesty: They enacted a law for levying men to serve on board of the royal navy: They fined all absentees, whether lords or commons; and vacated the seats of all those commissioners who refused to take the oath of assurance, which was equivalent to an abjuration of king James: They set on foot an inquiry about an intended invasion: They published some intercepted letters, supposed to be written to king James by Nevil Payne, whom they committed to prison, and threatened with a trial for high treason; but he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uded the danger, by threatening in his turn to impeach those who had made their peace with the government: They passed an act for the com∣prehension of such of the episcopal clergy as should condescend to take the oaths by the tenth day of July. All that the general assembly required of them, was an offer to subscribe the confession of faith, and to acknowledge presbytery as the only government of the Scottish church: but they neither submitted to these terms, nor took the oaths within the limited time; so that they forfeited all legal right to their benefices. Nevertheless, they continued in possession, and even received private assurances of the king's protection. It was one of William's political maxims to court his domestic enemies; but it was never attended with any good effect. This indulgence gave offence to the presbyterians, and former distractions began to revive.</P>

<P>The king having prevailed upon the states-general to augment their land-forces and navy for the service of the ensuing compaign, embarked for England, and arrived at Kensington on the thirtieth day of October. Finding the people clamorous and discontented, the trade of the nation decayed, the affairs of state mismanaged, and the ministers recriminating upon one an∣other, he perceived the necessity of changing hands, and resolved to take his measures accordingly. Sunderland his chief counsellor represented, that the Tories were averse to the continuance of a war, which had been productive of nothing but damage and disgrace; whereas the Whigs were much more practicable, and would bleed freely, partly from the terrors of invasion and popery, partly from the ambition of being courted by the crown, and partly from the prospect of advantage, in advancing money to the government on the funds established by parliament: for that sort of traffic which obtained the appellation of the monied-interest, was altogether a whiggish institution. The king revolved these observations in his own mind; and, in the mean time, the parliament met on the seventh day of November, pursuant to the last pro∣rogation. In his speech he expressed his resentment against those who were authors of the miscarriages at sea; represented the necessity of increasing the land-forces and the navy, and demanded a suitable supply for these purposes. In order to pave the way to their condescension, he had already dismissed from his council the earl of Nottingham, who, of all his ministers, was the most odious to the people. His place would have been immediately filled with the earl of Shrewsbury; but that nobleman suspecting this was a change of men rather than of measures, stood aloof for some time, until he received such assurances from the king as quieted his scruples, and then he accepted the
<PB N="113" REF="1160"/>
office of secretary. The lieutenancy for the city of London, and all other commissions over England, were altered with a view to favour the Whig in∣terest; and the individuals of that party were indulged with many places of trust and profit: but the Tories were too powerful in the house of commons to be exasperated, and therefore a good number of them were retained in office.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>On the sixth day of the session the commons unanimously re∣solved to support their majesties and their government; to inquire into mis∣carriages; and to consider means for preserving the trade of the nation. The Turky company were summoned to produce the petitions they had delivered to the commissioners of the admiralty for convoy; while lord Falkland, who sat at the head of that board, gave in copies of all the orders and directions sent to Sir George Rooke concerning the Streights fleet, together with a list of all the ships at that time in commission. It appeared, in the course of this inquiry, that the miscarriage of Rooke's fleet was in a great measure owing to the mis∣conduct of the admirals, and neglect of the victualing-office; but they were skreened by a majority. Mr. Harley, one of the commissioners for taking and stating the public accounts, delivered a report which contained a charge of pe∣culation against lord Falkland. Rainsford, receiver of the rights and perqui∣sites of the navy, confessed that he had received and payed more money than that which was charged in the accompts; and, in particular, that he had payed four thousand pounds to lord Falkland, by his majesty's order. This lord had acknowledged before the commissioners, that he had payed one half of the sum, by the king's order, to a person who was not a member of either house; and that the remainder was still in his hands. Rainsford owned he had the original letter which he received from Falkland, demanding the money; and this nobleman desiring to see it, detained the voucher; a circumstance that incensed the commons to such a degree, that a motion was made for commit∣ting him to the Tower, and debated with great warmth, but at last over-ruled by the majority. Nevertheless, they agreed to make him sensible of their displeasure, and he was reprimanded in his place. The house of lords having also inquired into the causes of the miscarriage at sea, very violent debates arose, and at length the majority resolved, that the admirals had done well in the execution of the orders they had received. This was a triumph over the Whig lords, who had so eagerly prosecuted the affair, and now protested against the resolution, not without great appearance of reason. The next step of the lords, was to exculpate the earl of Nottingham, as the blame seemed to lie with him, on the supposition that the admirals were innocent. With a view therefore to transfer this blame to Trenchard the whiggish secretary, he gave the house to understand, that he had received from Paris intelligence in the beginning of June, containing, a list of the enemy's fleet, and the time of their sailing; that this was communicated to a committee of the council, and particularly imparted to secretary Trenchard, whose province it was to transmit instructions to the admirals. Two conferences passed on this subject between the lords and commons. Trenchard delivered in his defence in writ∣ing; and was in his turn skreened by the whole efforts of the ministry, in which the Whig influence now predominated. Thus an inquiry of such na∣tional consequence, which took its rise from the king's own expression of re∣sentment against the delinquents, was stifled by the arts of the court, because
<PB N="114" REF="1170"/>
it was likely to affect one of its creatures: for, though there was no premedi∣tated treachery in the case, the interest of the public was certainly sacrificed to the mutual animosity of the ministers. The charge of lord Falkland being resumed in the house of commons, he appeared to have begged and received of the king, the remaining two thousand pounds of the money which had been payed by Rainsford: he was therefore declared guilty of a high misde∣meanor and breach of trust, and committed to the Tower; from whence, however, he was in two days discharged upon his petition.</P>

<P>Harley, Foley, and Harcourt, presented to the house a state of the receipts and issues of the revenue, together with two reports from the commissioners of the accounts, concerning sums issued for secret-services, and to members of parliament. This was a discovery of the most scandalous prac∣tices in the mystery of corruption, equally exercised on the individuals of both parties, in occasional bounties, grants, places, pensions, equivalents, and additional salaries. The malcontents therefore justly observed, the house of commons was so managed that the king could baffle any bill, quash all grievances, stifle accounts, and rectify the articles of Limerick. When the commons took into consider∣ation the estimates and supplies of the ensuing year, the king demanded forty thousand men for the navy, and above one hundred thousand for the purposes of the land-service. Before the house considered these enormous demands, they granted four hundred thousand pounds by way of advance, to quiet the clamours of the seamen, who were become mutinous and desperate for want of pay, upwards of one million being due to them for wages. Then the com∣mons voted the number of men required for the navy: but they were so ashamed of that for the army, that they thought it necessary to act in such a manner as should imply that they still retained some regard for their country. They called for all the treaties subsisting between the king and his allies: they ex∣amined the different proportions of the troops furnished by the respective powers: they considered the intended augmentations, and fixed the establishment of the year at fourscore and three thousand, one hundred and one and twenty men, including officers. For the maintenance of these they allotted the sum of two millions five hundred and thirty thousand, five hundred and ninety pounds. They granted two millions for the navy, and about five hundred thousand to make good the deficiencies of the annuity and poll-bills; so that the sup∣plies for the year amounted to about five millions and a half, raised by a land-tax of four shillings in the pound, by two more lives in the annuities, a further excise on beer, a new duty on salt, and a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ery.</P>

<P>Though the malcontents in parliament could not withstand this torrent of profusion, they endeavoured to distress the court-interest, by re∣viving the popular bills of the preceding sessions; such as that of regulating trials in cases of high-treason, the other for the more frequent calling and meeting of parliaments, and that concerning free and impartial proceedings in parliament. The first was neglected in the house of lords; the second was re∣jected; the third was passed by the commons, on the supposition that it would be defeated in the other house. The lords returned it with certain amend∣ments, to which the commons would not agree: a conference ensued; the peers receded from their corrections, and passed the bill, to which the king, however, refused his assent. Nothing could be more unpopular and danger∣ous
<PB N="115" REF="1180"/>
than such a step at this juncture. The commons, in order to recover some credit with the people, determined to disapprove of his majesty's conduct. The house formed itself into a committee, to take the state of the kingdom into consideration. They resolved, that whoever advised the king to refuse the royal assent to that bill, was an enemy to their majesties and the king∣dom. They likewise presented an address, expressing their concern that he had not given his consent to the bill, and beseeching his majesty to hearken for the future to the advice of his parliament, rather than to the counsels of particular persons, who might have private interests of their own, separate from those of his majesty and his people. The king thanked them for their zeal, professed a warm regard for their constitution; and assured them he would look upon all parties as enemies, who should endeavour to lessen the confidence subsisting between the sovereign and people. The members in the opposition were not at all satisfied with this general reply. A day being appointed to take it into consideration, a warm debate was maintained with equal eloquence and acrimony. At length the question being put, that an address should be made for a more explicit answer, it passed in the negative by a great majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The city of London petitioned that a parliamentary provision might be made for the orphans whose fortunes they had scandalously squandered away. Such an application had been made in the preceding session, and re∣jected with disdain as an imposition on the public: but now those scruples were removed, and they passed a bill for this purpose, consisting of many clauses, extending to different charges on the city lands, aqueducts, personal estates, and imposing duties on binding apprentices, constituting freemen, as also upon wines and coals imported into London. On the twenty-third day of March these bills received the royal assent; and the king took that opportunity of recommending dispatch, as the season of the year was far advanced, and the enemy diligently employed in making preparations for an early campaign. The scheme of a national bank, like those of Amsterdam and Genoa, had been recommended to the ministry, as an excellent institution, as well for the credit and security of the government, as for the increase of trade and circulation. One project was invented by doctor Hugh Chamberlain, proposing the circulation of tickets on land-security: but William Paterson was author of that which was carried into execution by the interest of Michael Godfrey, and other active pro∣jectors. The scheme was founded on the notion of a transferable fund, and a circulation by bill, on the credit of a large capital. Forty merchants subscribed to the amount of five hundred thousand pounds, as a fund of ready money to circulate one million at eight per cent. to be lent to the government; and even this fund of ready money bore the same interest. When it was properly digested in the cabinet, and a majority in parliament secured for its reception, the undertakers for the court introduced it into the house of commons, and ex∣patiated upon the national advantages that would accrue from such a measure. They said it would rescue the nation out of the hands of extortioners and usurers, lower interest, raise the value of land, revive and establish public credit, facilitate the annual supplies, and connect the people the more closely with the government. The project was violently opposed by a strong party, who af∣firmed that it would become a monopoly, and engross the whole money of the kingdom: that, as it must infallibly be subservie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to government views, it might be employed to the worst purposes of arbitrary power: that, instead of
<PB N="116" REF="1190"/>
assisting, it would weaken commerce, by tempting people to withdraw their money from trade, and employ it in stock-jobbing: that it would produce a swarm of brokers and jobbers to prey upon their fellow-creatures, enourage fraud and gaming, and further corrupt the morals of the nation. Notwith∣standing these objections, the bill made its way through the two houses, estab∣lishing the funds for the security and advantage of the subscribers; impowering their majesties to incorporate them by the name of The governor and company of the bank of England, under a proviso, that at any time after the first day of August, in the year one thousand seven hundred and five, upon a year's no∣tice, and the repayment of the twelve hundred thousand pounds, the said cor∣poration should cease and determine. The bill likewise contained clauses of appropriation for the services of the public. The whole subscription was filled in ten days after its being opened; and the court of directors com∣pleted the payment before the expiration of the time prescribed by the act, although they did not call in more than seven hundred and twenty thousand pounds of the money subscribed. All these funds proving in∣adequate to the estimates, the commons brought in a bill to impose stamp-duties upon all velum, parchment, and paper, used in almost every kind of intercourse between man and man; and they crowned the oppressions of the year with another grievous tax upon carriages, under the name of a bill for licensing and regulating hackney and stage-coaches.</P>

<P>The commons, in a clause of the bill for taxing several joint-stocks, provided, that in case of a default in the payment of that tax, within the time limited by the act, the charter of the company so failing should be deemed void and forfeited. The East-India company actually neglected their payment; and the public imagined the ministry would seize this oportunity of dissolving a monopoly against which so many complaints had been made: but they under∣stood their own strength; and, instead of being broke, obtained the promise of a new charter. This was no sooner known, than the controversy between them and their adversaries was revived with such animosity, that the council thought proper to indulge both parties with a hearing. As this produced no resolution, the merchants who opposed the company petitioned that, in the mean while, the new charter might be suspended. Addresses of the same kind were pre∣sented by a great number of clothiers, linen-drapers, and other dealers. To these a written answer was published by the company: the merchants printed a reply, in which they undertook to prove, that the company had been guilty of unjust and unwarrantable actions, tending to the scandal of religion, the dishonour of the nation, the reproach of our laws, the oppression of the people, and the ruin of the trade. They observed, that two private ships had exported in one year three times as many cloths as the company had exported in three years. They offered to send more cloth and English merchandise to the Indies in one year, than the company had exported in five; to furnish the govern∣ment with five hundred tons of salt-petre for less than one half of the usual price; and they represented, that the company could neither load the ships they petitioned for in England, nor reload them in the East Indies. In spite of all these remonstrances, the new charter passed the great seal; though the grants contained in it were limited in such a manner, that they did not amount to an exclusive privilege, and subjected the company to such alterations, re∣strictions, and qualifications, as the king should direct before the twenty-ninth
<PB N="117" REF="1200"/>
day of September. This indulgence, and other favours granted to the com∣pany, were privately purchased of the ministry, and became productive of a loud outcry against the government. The merchants published a journal of the whole transaction: they petitioned the house of commons, that their liberty of trading to the East-Indies might be confirmed by parliament. Another pe∣tition was presented by the company, praying that their charter might receive a parliamentary sanction. Both parties employed all their address in making private application to the members. The house having examined the different charters, the book of their new subscriptions, and every particular relating to the company, resolved that all the subjects of England had an equal right to trade to the East Indies, unless prohibited by act of parliament.</P>

<P>But nothing engrossed the attention of the public more than a bill which was brought into the house for a general naturalization of all fo∣reign protestants. The advocates for this measure alledged, That great part of the lands of England lay uncultivated: That the strength of a nation con∣sisted in the number of inhabitants: That the people were thinned by the war and foreign voyages, and required an extraordinary supply: That a great num∣ber of protestants, persecuted in France and other countries, would gladly remove to a land of freedom, and bring along with them their wealth and ma∣nufactures: That the community had been largely repayed for the protection granted to those refugees who had already settled in the kingdom. They had introduced several new branches of manufacture, promoted industry, and lowered the price of labour, a circumstance of the utmost importance to trade, op∣pressed as it was with taxes, and exposed to uncommon hazard from the enemy. The opponents of the bill urged with great vehemence, That it would cheapen the birthright of Englishmen: That the want of culture was owing to the op∣pression of the times: That foreigners being admitted into the privileges of the British trade, would grow wealthy at the expence of their benefactors, and transfer the fortunes they had gained into their native country: That the re∣duction in the price of labour would be a national grievance, while many thousands of English manufacturers were starving for want of employment, and the price of provisions continued so high that even those who were em∣ployed could scarce supply their families with bread: That the real design of the bill was to make such an accession to the dissenters as would render them an equal match in the body-politic for those of the church of England; to create a greater dependence on the crown, and, in a word, to supply a foreign head with foreign members. Sir John Knight, a member of the house, in a speech upon this subject, exaggerated the bad consequences that would attend such a bill, with all the wit and virulence of satire: it was printed and dis∣persed through the kingdom, and raised such a flame among the people as had not appeared since the revolution. They exclaimed, that all offices would be conferred upon Dutchmen, who would become Lord danes, and prescribe the modes of religion and government; and they extolled Sir John Knight as the saviour of the nation. The courtiers, incensed at the progress of this clamour, complained in the house of the speech, which had been printed; and Sir John was threatened with expulsion and imprisonment. He therefore<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Feuquieres. Life of king William.</NOTE> thought proper to disown the paper, which was burned by the hands of the common hangman. This sacrifice served only to increase the popular disturbance,

<P>Lord Coningsby and Mr. Porter had committed the most flagrant acts of oppression in Ireland. These had been explained during the last session, by the gentlemen who appealed against the administration of lord Sidney: but they were screened by the ministry; and therefore the earl of Bellamont now impeached them in the house of commons, of which he and they were members. After an examination of the articles exhibited against them, the commons, who were by this time at the devotion of the court, de∣clared, that considering the state of affairs in Ireland, they did not think them<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1694.</NOTE> fit grounds for an impeachment. In the course of this session, the nation sustained another misfortune in the fate of Sir Francis Wheeler, who had been appointed commander in chief of the Mediterranean squadron. He received instructions to take under his convoy the merchant ships bound to Turkey, Spain, and Italy; to cruise thirty days in a certain latitude, for the protection of the Spanish plate-fleet homeward bound; to leave part of his squadron at Cadiz, as convoy to the trade for England; to proceed with the rest to the Mediterranean; to join the Spanish fleet in his return; and to act in concert with them, until he should be joined by the fleet from Turkey and the Streights, and accompany them back to England. About the latter end of October he set sail from St. Helen's, and in January arrived at Cadiz with the ships under his convoy. There leaving rear-admiral Hopson, he proceeded for the Medi∣terranean. In the bay of Gibraltar he was overtaken with a dreadful tempest, under a lee-shore, which he could not possibly weather, and where the ground was so foul that no anchor would hold. This expedient, however, was tried. A great number of ships were driven ashore, and many perished. The admi∣ral's ship foundered at sea, and he and all his crew were buried in the deep, ex∣cept two Moors, who were miraculously preserved. Two other ships of the line, three ketches, and six merchant ships, were lost. The remains of the fleet were so much shattered, that instead of prosecuting their voyage, they re∣turned to Cadiz in order to be refitted, and sheltered from the attempts of the French squadrons, which were still at sea, under the command of Chateau-Renaud and Gabaret. On the twenty-fifth day of April the king closed the session with a speech in the usual stile, and the parliament was prorogued to the eighteenth day of September <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Besides the bills already mentioned, the par∣liament in this session passed an act for taking and slating the public accounts; another to encourage ship-building; a third for the better disciplining the navy; the usual militia act, and an act enab∣ling his majesty to make grants and leases in the dutchy of Cornwal. One was also passed for renewing a clause in an old statute limiting the number of justices of the peace in the principality of Wales. The duke of Norfolk brought an action into the court of king's-bench against Mr. Jermaine, for criminal conversation with his dutch∣ess. The cause was tried, and the jury brought in their verdict for one hundred marks and costs of suit, in favour of the plaintiff.</P>
<P>Before the king embarked, he gratified a good number of his friends with promotions. Lord Charles Butler, brother to the duke of Ormond, was created lord Butler of Weston in England, and earl of Arran in Ireland. The earl of Shrewsbury was honoured with the title of duke. The earl of Mulgrave being reconciled to the court-measures, was gratified with a pen∣sion of three thousand pounds, and the title of marquis of Normanby. Henry Herbert was ennobled by the title of baron Herbert of Cherbury. The earls of Bedford, Devonshire, and Clare, were promoted to the rank of dukes. The marquis of Carmarthen was made duke of Leeds, lord viscount Sidney earl of Rumney, and the viscount Newport earl of Bedford. Rus∣sel was advanced to the head of the admiralty-board. Sir George Rooke and Sir John Houblon were appointed joint-commissioners in the room of Killegrew and Delaval. Charles Montague was made chancellor of the exchequer; Sir Wil∣liam Trumbal and John Smith commissioners of the treasury, in the room of Sir Edward Sey∣mour and Mr. Hambden.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<P>Lewis of France being tired of the war, which had impoverished his country, continued to tamper with the duke of Savoy, and, by the canal of the pope, made some offers to the king of Spain, which were rejected. Mean while he resolved to stand upon the defensive during the ensuing cam∣paign, in every part but Catalonia, where his whole naval force might co∣operate with the count de Noailles, who commanded the land-army. King William having received intelligence of their design upon Bareelona, en∣deavoured to prevent the junction of the Brest and Toulon squadrons, by send∣ing Russel to sea as early as the fleet could be in a condition to sail: but, be∣fore he arrived at Portsmouth, the Brest squadron had quitted that harbour. On the third day of May the admiral sailed from St. Helen's, with the combined squadrons of England and Holland, amounting to ninety ships of the line, besides frigates, fire-ships, and tenders. He detached captain Pritchard of the Monmouth with two fire-ships to destroy a fleet of French merchant-ships near Conquet-bay; and this service being performed, he re∣turned to St. Helen's, where he had left Sir Cloudesley Shovel with a squa∣dron, to take on board a body of land-forces, intended for a descent upon the coast of France. These being embarked, under the command of general Tal∣mash, the whole fleet sailed again on the twenty-ninth of May. The land and sea-officers, in a council of war, agreed that part of the fleet designed for this expedition, should separate from the rest, and proceed to Camaret bay, where the forces should be landed. On the fifth day of June, lord Berkeley, who commanded this squadron, parted with the grand fleet, and on the seventh anchored between the bays of Camaret and Bertaume. Next day the marquis of Carmarthen, afterwards duke of Leeds, who served under Berkeley, as rear-admiral of the blue, entered Camaret bay with two large ships and six frigates, to cover the troops in landing. The French had received intelligence of the design, and taken such precautions, under the con∣duct of the celebrated engineer Vauban, that the English were exposed to a terrible fire from new-erected batteries, as well as from a strong body of troops; and, though the ships cannonaded them with great vigour, the soldiers could not maintain any regularity in landing. A good number were killed in the open boats before they reached the shore; and those who landed were soon repulsed, in spite of all the endeavours of general Talmash, who received a wound in the thigh which proved mortal. Seven hundred soldiers are said to have been lost on this occasion, besides those that were killed on board of the ships. The Monk ship of war was towed off with great difficulty; but a Dutch frigate of thirty guns fell into the hands of the enemy.</P>

<P>After this unfortunate attempt, lord Berkeley, with the advice of a council of war, sailed back for England, and at St. Helen's received orders from the queen to call a council, and deliberate in what manner the ships
<PB N="120" REF="1230"/>
and forces might be best employed. They agreed to make some attempt upon the coast of Normandy. With this view they set sail on the fifth day of July. They bombarded Dieppe, and reduced the greatest part of the town to ashes. Thence they steered to Havre de Grace, which met with the same fate. They harrassed the French troops, who marched after them along-shore. They alarmed the whole coast, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled every town with such consternation, that they would have been abandoned by the inhabitants, had not they been de∣tained by military force. On the twenty-sixth day of July, lord Berkeley re∣turned to St. Helen's, where he quitted the fleet, and the command devolved upon Sir Cloudesley Shovel. This officer having received instructions to make an attempt upon Dunkirk, sailed round to the Downs, where he was joined by M. Meesters, with six and twenty Dutch pilots. On the twelfth of September he appeared before Dunkirk; and next day sent in the Charles galley, with two bomb-ketches, and as many of the machines called Infernals. These were set on fire without effect; and the design miscarried: then Shovel steered for Ca∣lais, which having bombarded with little success, he returned to the coast of England; and the bomb-ketches and machines were sent into the river Thames.</P>

<P>During these transactions, admiral Russel with the grand fleet sailed for the Mediterranean; and being joined by rear-admiral Neville from Cadiz, toge∣ther with Callembergh and Evertzen, he steered towards Barcelona, which was besieged by the French fleet and army. At his approach Tourville retired with precipitation into the harbour of Toulon; and Noailles abandoned his enter∣prize. The Spanish affairs were in such a deplorable condition, that without this timely assistance the kingdom must have been undone. While he continued in the Mediterranean, the French admiral durst not venture to appear at sea; and all his projects were disconcerted. After having asserted the honour of the Bri∣tish flag in those seas during the whole summer, he sailed, in the beginning of November to Cadiz, where, by an express order of the king, he passed the winter, during which, he took such precautions for preventing Tourville from passing the Streights, that he did not think proper to risque the passage.</P>

<P>It will now be necessary to describe the operations on the continent. In the middle of May king William arrived in Holland, where he consulted with the states-general. On the third day of June he repaired to Bertherme abbey near Louvain, the place appointed for the rendezvous of the army; and there he was met by the electors of Bavaria and Cologne. In a few days a nu∣merous army was assembled; and every thing seemed to promise an active cam∣paign. On the third day of June the dauphin took the command of the French forces, with which Luxembourg had taken post between Mons and Maubeuge; and passing the Sambre, encamped at Fleurus: but, on the eigh∣teenth, he removed from thence, and took up his quarters between St. Tron and Wanheim; while the confederates lay at Roosbeck. On the eleventh of July, the dauphin matched in four columns to Oerle upon the Jaar, where he pitched his camp. On the twenty-second, the confederates marched to Bomale: then the dauphin took the route to Vignamont, where he secured his army by in∣trenchments, as his forces were inferior in number to those of the allies; and he had been directed by his father to avoid an engagement. In this situation both armies remained till the fifteenth day of August, when king William sent

the heavy baggage to Louvain; and on the eighteenth made a motion to Som∣bref. This was no sooner known to the enemy, than they decamped; and having marched all night, posted themselves between Tempion and Masy, within a league and an half of the confederates. The king of England resolved to pass the Scheld; and with this view marched by the way of Neville and Soignies, to Chivere: from thence he detached the duke of Wirtemberg, with a strong body of horse and foot, to pass the river at Oudenarde, while the elector of Bavaria advanced with another detachment to pass it at Pont D'Espieres. Not∣withstanding all the expedition they could make, their purpose was anticipated by Luxembourg, who being apprized of their route, had detached four thou∣sand horse, with each a foot soldier behind the trooper, to reinforce Mr. de Valette, who commanded that part of the French lines. These were sustained by a choice body of men, who travelled with great expedition, without observing the formalities of a march. The marechal de Villeroy followed the same route, with all the cavalry of the right wing, the houshold-troops, and twenty field-pieces; and the rest of the army was brought up by the dauphin in person. They marched with such incredible diligence, that the elector of Bavaria could scarce believe his own eyes, when he arrived in sight of the Scheld, and saw them entrenching themselves on the other side of the river. King William hav∣ing reconnoitred their disposition, thought it impracticable to pass at that place, and therefore marched down the river to Oudenarde, where the passage had been already effected by the duke of Wirtemberg. Here the confederates passed the Scheld on the twenty-seventh day of the month; and the king fixed his head-quarters at Wanneghem. His intention was to have taken possession of Courtray, and establish winter-quarters for a considerable part of his army in that district; but, Luxembourg having posted himself between that place and Menin, extended his lines in such a manner, that the confederates could not attempt to force them, nor even hinder him from subsisting his army at the expence of the castellany of Courtray, during the remainder of the cam∣paign. This surprising march was of such importance to the French king, that he wrote with his own hand a letter of thanks to his army; and ordered that it should be read to every particular squadron and battalion.</P>

<P>The king of England, though disappointed in his scheme upon Courtray, found means to make some advantage of his superiority in number. He draughted troops from the garrisons of Liege and Maestricht; and on the third day of September reinforced this body with a large detachment from his own camp, conferring the command upon the duke of Holstein-Ploen, with orders to undertake the siege of Huy. Next day, the whole confederate forces passed the Lys, and encamped at Wenterghem. From thence the king, with part of the army, marched to Roselaer; and this division obliged the dauphin to make considerable detachments for the security of Ypres and Menin, on one side, and to cover Furnes and Dunkirk on the other. At this juncture, a French∣man being seized in the very act of setting fire to one of the ammunition-wag∣gons in the allied army, confessed he had been employed for this purpose by some of the French generals; and suffered death as a traitor. On the sixteenth day of the month, the duke of Holstein-Ploen invested Huy, and carried on the siege with such vigour, that in ten days the garrison capitulated. The king ordered Dixmuyde, Deynse, Ninove, and Tirlemont, to be secured for winterquarters
<PB N="122" REF="1250"/>
to part of the army; the dauphin returned to Versailles, William quitted the camp on the last day of September; and both armies broke up about the middle of October.</P>

<P>The operations on the Rhine had been preconcerted between king William and the prince of Baden, who visited London in the winter. The di∣spute between the emperor and the elector of Saxony was compromised; and this young prince dying during the negotiation, the treaty was perfected by his brother and successor, who engaged to furnish twelve thousand men yearly, in consideration of a subsidy from the court of Vienna. In the beginning of June, the marechal de Lorges passed the Rhine at Philipsburg, in order to give battle to the Imperialists, encamped at Hailbron. The prince of Baden, who was not yet joined by the Saxons, Hessians, nor by the troops of Munster and Pader∣born, dispatched couriers to quicken the march of these auxiliaries, and ad∣vanced to Eppingen, where he proposed to wait until they should come up: but, on the fifteenth, receiving undoubted intelligence, that the enemy were in motion towards him, he advanced to meet them in order of battle. De Lorges concluded, that this was a desperate effort, and immediately halted, to make the necessary preparations for an engagement. This pause enabled prince Lewis to take possession of a strong pass near Sintzheim, from which he could not easily be dislodged. Then the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>chal proceeded to Viseloch, and ravaged the adjacent country, in hope of drawing the Imperialists from their intrench∣ments. The prince being joined by the Hessians, resolved to beat up the quarters of the enemy; and the French general being apprized of his design, retreated at midnight with the utmost precipitation. Having posted himself at Ruth, he sent his heavy baggage to Philipsburg; then he moved to Gonsbergh in the neighbourhood of Manheim, repassed the Rhine, and encamped between Spires and Worms. The prince of Baden being joined by the allies, passed the river by a bridge of boats near Hagenbach, in the middle of September; and layed the country of Alsace under contribution. Considering the advanced season of the year, this was a rash undertaking; and the French general resolved to profit by his enemy's temerity. He forthwith advanced against the Imperialists, fore∣seeing that should they be worsted in battle, their whole army would be ruined. Prince Lewis, informed of his intention, immediately repassed the Rhine; and this retreat was no sooner effected, than the river swelled to such a degree, that the island in the middle, and great part of the camp he had occupied, was overflowed. Soon after this incident both armies retired into winter-quarters. The campaign in Hungary produced no event of importance. It was opened by the new vizi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who arrived at Belgrade in the middle of August; and about the same time Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rara assembled the Imperial army in the neighbourhood of Peterwara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n. The Turks passed the Saave, in order to attack their camp, and carried on their approaches with five hundred pieces of cannon, but made very little progress. The Imperialists received reinforcements; the season wasted away; a feud arose between the vizir and the cham of the Tartars; and the Danube being swelled by heavy rains, so as to interrupt the operations of the Turks, their general decamped in the night on the first day of October. They afterwards made an unsuccessful attempt upon Titul, while the Imperial general made himself master of Giula. In the course of this summer, the Ve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tians, who were also at war with the Turks, reduced Cy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lut, a place of im∣portance

<P>We have already observed, that the French king had determined to act vigorously in Catalonia. In the beginning of May, the duke de No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illes ad∣vanced at the head of eight and twenty thousand men to the river Ter, on the op∣posite bank of which the viceroy of Catalonia was encamped with sixteen thousand Spaniards. The French general passed the river in the face of this army, and attacked their intrenchments with such impetuosity, that in less than an hour they were totally defeated. Then he marched to Palamos, and undertook the siege of that place, while at the same time it was blocked up by the combined squadrons of Brest and Toulon. Though the besieged made an obstinate defence, the town was taken by storm, the houses were pillaged, and the people put to the sword, without distinction of age, sex, or condition. Then he invested Gironne, which in a few days capitulated. Ostalric met with the same fate; and Noailles was created viceroy of Catalonia by the French king. In the beginning of Au∣gust he distributed his forces into quarters of refreshment, along the river Ter∣dore, resolving to undertake the siege of Barcelona, which was saved by the arrival of admiral Russel. The war languished in Piedmont, on account of a secret negotiation between the king of France and the duke of Savoy; notwith∣standing the remonstrances of Rouvigny, earl of Galway, who had succeeded the duke of Schomberg in the command of the British forces in that country. Casal was closely blocked up by the reduction of Fort St. George, and the Vaudois gained the advantage in some skirmishes in the valley of Ragelas; but no design of importance was executed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this year, Mr. du Casse, go∣vernor of St. Domingo, made an unsuccessful at∣tempt upon the island of Jamaica; and Mr. St. Clair, with four men of war, formed a design against St. John's in Newfoundland, but he was repulsed with loss by the valour of the inhabitants.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>England had continued very quiet under the queen's administra∣tion, if we except some little commotions occasioned by the practices, or pre∣tended practices of the Jacobites. Prosecutions were revived against certain gentlemen of Lancashire and Cheshire, for having been concerned in the con∣spiracy formed in favour of the late king's projected invasion from Normandy. These steps were owing to the suggestions of infamous informers, whom the ministry countenanced. Colonel Parker and one Crosby were imprisoned, and bills of treason found against them; but, Parker made his escape from the Tower, and was never retaken, though a reward of four hundred pounds was set upon his head. The king having settled the affairs of the confederacy at the Hague, embarked for England on the eighth of November, and next day landed at Margate. On the twelfth he opened the session of parliament, with a speech, in which he observed that the posture of affairs was improved both by sea and land since they last parted; in particular, that a stop was put to the progress of the French arms. He demanded such supplies as would enable him to prosecute the war with vigour. He desired they would continue the act of tonnage and poundage, which would expire at Christmas: he reminded them of the debt for the transport ships employed in the reduction of Ireland; and exhorted them to prepare some good bill for the encouragement of seamen. A majority in both houses was already secured; and in all probability, he bar∣gained

This Mr. Harley brought in, by order of the lower house, immediately after their first adjournment; and it kept pace with the consideration of the supplies. The commons having examined the estimates and accounts, voted four millions, seven hundred sixty-four thousand, seven hundred and twelve pounds for the service of the army and navy. In order to raise this sum, they continued the land-tax. They renewed the subsidy of tonnage and poundage for five years, and imposed new duties on different commodities <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posed c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d duties upon marria<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ls, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tchelors and wi∣dows.

<P>While this bill was depending, Dr. John Tillotson, archbishop of Canterbury, was seized with a fit of the dead palsy, in the chapel of Whitehall, and died on the twenty-second day of November, deeply regretted by the king and queen, who shed tears of sorrow at his decease; and sincerely lamented by the public, as a pattern of elegance, ingenuity, meekness, charity, and modera∣tion. These qualities he must be allowed to have possessed, notwithstanding the invectives of his enemies, who accused him of puritanism, flattery, and ambition; and charge him with having conduced to a dangerous schism in the church, by accepting the archbishopric during the life of the deprived Sancroft. He was succeeded in the metropolitan see by Dr. Teni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, bishop of Lincoln, recommended by the Whig-party, which now predominated in the cabinet. The qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en did not long survive her favourite prelate. In about a month after his de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, she was taken ill of the small-pox, and the symptoms proving dan∣gerous, she prepared herself for death with great composure. She spent some time in exercises of devotion, and private conversation with the new archbishop: she rece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved the sacrament with all the bishops who were in attendance; and expired on the twenty-eighth day of December, in the thirty-third year of her age, and in the sixth of her reign, to the inexpressible grief of the king, who for some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeks after her death could neither see company, nor attend to the bu∣siness of state.

and seems to have been a stranger to the emotions of natural affection; for she ascended, without compunction, the throne from which her father had been deposed, and treated her sister as an alien to her blood. In a word, Mary seems to have imbibed the cold disposition and apathy of her husband; and to have centered all her ambition in deserving the epithet of an humble and obedi∣ent wife <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Her obsequies were performed with great magnificence. The body was attended from Whitehall to Westminster-abbey, by all the judges, serjeants at law, the lord-mayor, and aldermen of the city of London, and both houses of parlia∣ment; and the funeral sermon was preached by Dr. Tenison, archbishop of Canterbury. Dr. Kenn, the deprived bishop of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th and Wells, reproached him in a letter, for not having called upon her majesty on her death-bed, to repent of the share she had in the revolution.

Before her death, however, she sent a forgiving message to her sister; and, after her decease, the earl of Sun∣derland effected a reconciliation between the king and the princess, who visited him at Kensington, where she was received with uncommon civility. He ap∣pointed the palace of St. James's for her residence; and presented her with the greater part of the queen's jewels. But a mutual jealousy and disgust subsisted under these exteriors of friendship and esteem.

These were delivered <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Aaron Smith, solli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ito<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the treasury, who, with messengers, accompanied Lunt and his assoc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ates to Lancashire, under the protection of a party of Dutch horse-guards, commanded by one captain Baker. They were impowered to break open houses, seize papers, and apprehend per∣sons, according to their pleasure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they committed many act<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of violence and oppression. The persons against whom <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hese meas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>res were taken, being apprised of the impending danger, generally retired from their own habita∣tions. Some, however, were taken and impriso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed: a few arms were secured, and, in the house of Mr. Standish, at Standish-hall, they found the draught of a declaration to be published by king James at his landing. As this prosecu∣tion seemed calculated to revive the rumour of a stale conspiracy, and the evidences were persons of abandoned characters, the friends of those who were persecuted found no great difficulty in rendering the scheme odious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the na∣tion. They even employed the pen of Fergu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, who had been converned in every plot that was hatched since the Rye-house conspiracy. This ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eran, though appointed house-keeper to the excise-office, thought himself poorly re∣compensed for the part he had acted in the revolution, became diss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and, upon this occasion, published a letter to Sir John T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chard, on the abuse of power. It was repl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te with the most bitter invectives against the ministry, and contained a great number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lagrant instances, in which the court had countenanced the vil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st corruption, persidy, and oppre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion. This production was in every body's hand, and had such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffect upon the people, that when the prisoners were brought to trial at Manchester, the populace would have put the witnesses to death, had not they been prevented by the interposition of those who were friends to the accused persons, and had already taken e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ectual measures for their safety. Lunt's chief associate in the mystory of information was one Taaffe, a wretch of the most profligate principles, who, finding him∣self disappointed in his hope of reward from the ministry, was privat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly gained over by the agents for the prisoners. Lunt, when desired in court to point out the persons whom he had accused, committed such a mistake as greatly invali∣dated his testimony; and Taaffe declared before the bench, that the pretended plot was no other than a contrivance between himself and Lunt, in order to procure money from the government. The prisoners were immediately ac∣quitted, and the ministry incurred a heavy load of popular odium, as the authors or abettors of knavish contrivances to ensnare the innocent. The go∣vernment, with a view to evince their abhorrence of such practices, ordered the witnesses to be prosecuted for a conspiracy against the lives and e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tates of the gentlemen who had been accused; and at last the affair was brought into

The p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers concurred with the commons in their sentiments of this affair; for complaints having been laid before their house also, by the persons who thought themselves aggrieved, the question was put, Whether the government had cause to prosecute them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and carried in the affir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ative; though a protest was entered against this vote by the earls of Rochester and Nottingham.

<P>Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the commons were employed in examining the state of the reven<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and taking measures for raising the necessary supplies, the inhabi∣tants of Royston presented a petition, complaining, that the officers and soldiers of the regiment bel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nging to colonel Hastings, which was quartered upon them, exacted subsistence-money, even on pain of military execution. The house was immediately kindled into a flame by this information. The officers, and Pauncefort, agent for the regiment, were examined; and it was unani∣mously resolved, That such a practice was arbitrary, illegal, and a violation of the rights and liberties of the subject. Upon further inquiry, Pauncefort and some other agents were committed to the custody of the serjeants, for having neglected to pay the subsistence-money they had received for the offi∣cers and soldiers. He was afterwards sent to the Tower, together with Henry Guy, a member of the house, and secretary to the treasury, the one for giving, and the other for receiving, a bribe to obtain the king's bounty. Pauncefort's brother was likewis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> committed, for being concerned in the same commerce.

Notwithstanding these concessions, the commons prosecuted their examinations: they committed Mr. James Craggs, one of the contractors for cloathing the army, because he refused to answer upon oath to such questions as might be put to him by the commissioners of accompts. They brought in a bill for obliging him and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Boyer. Oldmixon. State Tracts. Tirdal. Ralph.

At this period, they received a petition against the commissioners for licensing hackney-coaches.

<P>Those who encouraged this spirit of reformation, introduced another inquiry about the orphans bill, which was said to have passed into an act, by virtue of undue influence. A committee being appointed to inspect the cham∣berlain's books, discovered that bribes had been given to Sir John Trevor speaker of the house, and Mr. Hungerford chairman of the grand committee. The first being voted guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour, abdicated the chair, and Paul Foley was appointed speaker in his room. Then he and Hungerford were expelled the house; while one Nois, a sollicitor for the bill, was taken into custody, because he had scandalized the commons, in pretending he was engaged to give great sums to several members, and denying this cir∣cumstance on his examination. The reformers in the house naturally concluded<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1695.</NOTE> that the same arts had been practised in obtaining the new charter of the East India company, which had been granted so much against the sense of the na∣tion. Their books were subjected to the same committee that carried on the former inquiry, and a surprising scene of venality and corruption was soon disclosed. It appeared that the company, in the cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e of the preceding year, had payed near ninety<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thousand pounds in secret-services; and that Sir Thomas Cooke, one of the directors, and a member of the house, had been the chief manager of this infamous commerce. Cooke refusing to answer, was com∣mitted to the Tower, and a bill of pains and penalties brought in, obliging him to discover how the sum mentioned in the report of the committee had been distributed. The bill was violently oppos<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the upper house by the duke of Leeds, as being contrary to law and equity, and furnishing a prece∣dent of a dangerous nature. Cooke being, agreeably to his own petition, brought to the bar of the house of lords, declared that he was ready and will∣ing to make a full discovery, in case he might be favoured with an indemnify∣ing vote, to secure him against all actions and suits, except those of the East India company, which he had never injured. The lords complied with his re∣quest, and passed a bill for this purpose, to which the commons added a penal clause; and the former was laid aside.</P>

<P>When the king went to the house to give the royal assent to the money∣bills, he endeavoured to discourage this inquiry, by telling the parliament that the season of the year was far advanced, and the circumstances of affairs ex∣tremely pressing: he therefore desired they would dispatch such affairs as they
<PB N="130" REF="1330"/>
should think of most importance to the public, as he should put an end to the session in a few days. No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>withstanding this shameful interposition, both houses appointed a joint committee to lay open the complicated scheme of fraud and iniquity. Cooke on his first examination confessed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he had delivered ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ies for ten thousand pounds to Francis Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en deputy-governor, for the special service of the company; an equal sum to Richard Acton, for employ∣ing his interest in preventing a new settlement, and endeavouring to establish the old company, besides two thousand pounds by way of interest, and as a further gratuity; a thousand guineas to colonel Fitzpatrick, five hundred to Charles Bates, and three hundred and ten to Mr. Molineaux, a merchant, for the same purposes; and he owned that Sir Basil Firebrace had received forty thousand pounds on various pretences. He said, he believed the ten thousand pounds payed to Ty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en had been delivered to the king by Sir Josiah Child, as a customary present which former kings had received: and that the sums payed to Acton were distributed among some members of parliament. Fire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>race being examined, affirmed that he had received the whole forty thousand pounds for his own use and benefit; but that Bates had received sums of money, which he understood were offered to some persons of the first quality. Acton declared, that ten thousand pounds of the sum which he had received, was distributed among persons who had interest with members of parliament; and that great part of the money passed through the hands of Craggs, who was acquainted with some colonels in the house, and northern members. Bates owned he had received the money, in consideration of using his interest with the duke of Leeds in favour of the company: that this nobleman knew of the gratuity; and that the sum was reckoned by his grace's domestic, one Ro∣bart, a foreigner, who kept it in his possession until this inquiry was talked of, and then it was returned. In a word, it appeared by this man's testimony, as well as by that of Firebrace on his second examination, that the duke of Leeds was not free from corruption; and that Sir John Trevor was a hireling prostitute.</P>

<HEAD>§ V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HEAD>
<P>The report of the committee produced violent altercation, and the most severe strictures upon the conduct of the lord president. At length the house resolved, That there was sufficient matter to impeach Thomas duke of Leeds of high crimes and misdemeanours; and that he should be impeached there∣upon. Then it was ordered, That Mr. comptroller Wharton should impeach him before the lords, in the name of the house, and of all the commons in England. The duke was actually in the middle of a speech for his own justi∣fication, in which he assured the house, upon his honour, that he was not guilty of the corruptions laid to his charge, when one of his friends gave him intimation of the votes which had passed in the commons. He concluded his speech abruptly, and repairing to the lower house, desired he might be in∣dulged with a hearing. He was accordingly admitted, with the compliment of a chair, and leave to be covered. After having sat a few minutes, he took off his hat, and addressed himself to the commons in very extraordinary terms. Having thanked them for the favour of indulging him with a hearing, he said the house would not have been then <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itting but for him. He protested his own innocence, with respect to the crime laid to his charge. He complained that this was the effect of a design which had been long formed against him. He
<PB N="131" REF="1340"/>
expressed a deep sense of his being under the displeasure of the parliament and nation, and demanded speedy justice. They forthwith drew up the articles of impeachment, which being exhibited at the ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the upper house, he pleaded Not guilty, and the commons promised to make good their charge: but, by this time, such arts had been used, as all at once checked the violence of the prosecution. Such a number of considerable persons were involved in this mystery of corruption, that a full discovery was dreaded by both parties. The duke sent his domestic Rob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt out of the kingdom, and his absence furnished a pretence for postponing the trial. In a word, the inquiry was dropped; but the scandal stuck fast to the duke's character.</P>

<P>In the midst of these deliberations, the king went to the house on the third day of May, when he thanked the parliament for the supplies they had granted; signified his intention of going abroad; assured them he would place the administration of affairs in persons of known care and fidelity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and desired that the members of both houses would be more than ordinarily vigilant in preserving the public peace. Then the parliament was prorogued to the eighteenth of June <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the course of this session, the lords had enquired into the particulars of the Mediter∣ranean expedition, and presented an address to the king, declaring, that the fleet in those <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s had conduced to the honour and advantage of the nation. On the other hand, the commons, in an address, besought his majesty to take care that the kingdom might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e put on an equal foot∣ing and proportion with the allies, in defraying the expence of the war.</P>
<P>The coin of the kingdom being greatly di∣minished and adulterated, the earls of Rochester and Nottingham expatiated upon this national evil in the house of lords; and an act was passed, containing severer penalties against clippers: but this produced no good effect. The value of the money <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unk in the exchange to such a degree, that a guinea was reckoned adequate to thirty shillings; and this public disgrace lowered the credit of the funds and of the government. The nation was alarmed by the circulation of fictiti∣ous wealth, instead of gold and silver, such as bank-bills, exchequer-tallies, and government-securities. The malcontents took this opportu∣nity to exclaim against the bank, and even at∣tempted to shake the credit of it in parliament: but their endeavours proved abortive; the mo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed-interest preponderated in both houses.</P></NOTE>. The king immediately appointed a regency to go∣vern the kingdom in his absence; but neither the princess of Denmark nor her husband was intrusted with any share in the administration; a circumstance that evinced the king's jealousy, and gave offence to a good part of the nation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The regency was composed of the arch∣bishop of Canterbury; Somer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, lord-keeper of the great seal; the earl of Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>broke, lord privy-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eal; the duke of Devonshire, lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>eward of the houshold; the duke of Shrewsbury, secre∣tary of state; the earl of Dor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d chamber∣lain; and the lord Godolphi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, first commi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ione<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the treasury.

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>A session of parliament was deemed necessary in Scotland, to provide new subsidies for the maintenance of the troops of that kingdom, which had been so serviceable in the prosecution of the war. But, as a great outcry had been raised against the government, on account of the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>acre of Glencoe, and the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ots were tired of contributing towards the expence of a war from which they could derive no advantage, the ministry thought proper to cajole them with the promise of some national indulgence. In the mean time, a
<PB N="132" REF="1350"/>
commission passed the great seal, for taking a precognition of the massacre, as a previous step to the trial of the persons concerned in that perfidious transaction. On the ninth of May, the session was opened by the marquis of Tweedale, ap∣pointed commissioner, who, after the king's letter had been read, expatiated on his majesty's care and concern for their safety and welfare; and his firm purpose to maintain the presbyterian discipline in the church of Scotland. Then he pro∣mised, in the king's name, that if they should pass an act for establishing a co∣lony in Africa, America, or any other part of the world where a colony might be lawfully planted, his majesty would indulge them with such rights and pri∣vileges as he had granted in like cases to the subjects of his other dominions. Finally, he exhorted them to consider ways and means to raise the necessary sup∣plies for maintaining their l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d-forces, and for providing a competent number of ships of war to protect their commence. The parliament immediately voted an address of condolance to his majesty on the death of the queen; and they granted one hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling for the services of the ensuing year, to be raised by a general poll tax, a land-tax, and an addi∣tional excite.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>Their next step was to desire the commissioner would transmit their humble thanks to the king for his care to vindicate the honour of the govern∣ment and the justice of the nation, in ordering a precognition to be taken with respect to the slaughter of Glencoe. A motion was afterwards made, that the commissioners should exhibit an account of their proceedings in this affair; and accordingly a report, consisting of the king's instructions, Dalrymple's letters, the depositions of witnesses, and the opinion of the committee, was laid before the parliament. The motion is said to have been privately influenced by se∣cretary Johnston, for the disgrace of Dalrymple, who was his rival in power and interest. The written opinion of the commissioners, who were creatures of the court, imported. That Macdonald of Glencoe had been perfi∣diously murdered; that the king's intentions contained nothing to warrant the massacre; and that the secretary D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lrymple had exceeded his orders. The parliament concurred with this report. They resolved, That Living∣ston was not to blame, for having given the orders contained in his let∣ters to lieutenant-colonel Hamilton: that this last was liable to prosecution: that the king should be addressed to give orders, either for examining major Duncanson in Flanders, touching his concern in this affair, or for sending him home to be tried in Scotland; as also, that Campbel of Glenlyon, captain Drummond, lieutenant Lindsey, ensign Lundy, and serjeant Barber, should be sent to Scotland, and prosecuted according to law, for the parts they had acted in that execution. In consequence of these resolutions, the parliament drew up an address to the king, in which they laid the whole blame of the massacre upon the excess in the master of Stair's letters concerning that tran∣saction. They begged that his majesty should give such orders about him, as he should think fit for the vindication of his government; that the actors in that barbarous slaughter might be prosecuted by the king's advocate, according to law; and that some reparation might be made to the men of Glencoe who escaped the massacre, for the losses they had sustained in their effects upon that occasion, as their habitations had been plundered and burned, their lands wasted, and their cattle driven away; so that they were reduced to extreme
<PB N="133" REF="1360"/>
poverty. Notwithstanding this address of the Scottish parliament, by which the king was so solemnly exculpated, his memory is still loaded with the suspicion of having concerted, countenanced, and enforced this barbarous execution, especially as the master of Stair escaped with impunity, and the other actors of the tragedy, far from being punished, were preferred in the service. While the commissioners were employed in the inquiry, they ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e such discoveries concerning the conduct of the earl of Braidalbin as amounted to a charge of high-treason; and he was committed prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh; but it seems he had dissembled with the Highlanders, by the king's permission, and now sheltered himself under the shadow of a royal pardon.</P>

<P>The committee of trade, in pursuance of the powers granted by the king to his commissioner, prepared an act for establishing a company trading to Africa and the Indies, impowering them to plant colonies, hold cities, towns or forts, in places uninhabited, or in others, with the consent of the natives; vesting them with an exclusive right, and an exemption for one and twenty years from all duties or impositions. This act was likewise confirmed by letters-patent under the great seal, directed by the parliament, without any further warrant from the crown. Paterson the projector had contrived the scheme of a settle∣ment upon the Isthmus of Darien, in such a manner as to carry on a trade in the South-sea, as well as in the Atlantic, nay even to extend it as far as the East Indies; and a great number of London merchants, allured by the prospect of gain, were eager to engage in such a company, exempted from all manner of imposition and restriction. The Scottish parliament likewise passed an act in favour of the episcopal clergy, decreeing, That those who should enter into such engagements to the king as were by law required, might continue in their benefices under his majesty's protection, without being subject to the power of presbytery. Seventy of the most noted ministers of that persuasion took the benefit of this indulgence. Another law was enacted for raising nine thousand men yearly, to recruit the Scottish regiments abroad; and an act for erecting a public bank: then the parliament was adjourned to the seventh day of November.</P>

Lord Cap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, the lord-deputy, governed in a very partial manner, oppressing the Irish papists, without any regard to equity or decorum. He undertook to model a parliament in such a manner, that they should comply with all the demands of the ministry; and he succeeded in his endeavours, by making such arbitrary changes in offices as best sorted his purpose. These precautions being taken, he convoked a parliament for the twenty-seventh day of August, when he opened the session with a speech, expatiating upon their obliga∣tions to king William, and exhorting them to make suitable returns to such a gra∣cious sovereign. He observed, that the revenue had fallen short of the esta∣blishment; to that both the civil and military lifts were greatly in debt: that his majesty had sent over a bill for an additional excise, and expected they would find ways and means to answer the demands of the service. They forth∣with voted an address of thanks, and resolved to assist his majesty to the ut∣most of their power, against all his enemies foreign and domestic. They passed the bill for an additional excise, together with an act for taking away the writs "De here<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ico comburendo;" another annulling all attainders and acts
<PB N="134" REF="1370"/>
passed in the late pretended parliament of king James: a third to prevent fo∣reign education: a fourth for disarming papists: and a fifth for settling the estates of int<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>states. Then they resolved, That a sum not exceeding one hun∣dred and sixty-three thousand, three hundred and twenty-five pounds, should be granted to his majesty, to be raised by a poll-bill, additional customs, and a continuation of the additional excise. Sir Charles Porter, the chancellor, find∣ing his importance diminished, if not intirely destroyed by the assuming dispo∣sition and power of the lord-deputy, began to court popularity, by espousing the cause of the Irish, against the severity of the administration; and actually formed a kind of Tory-interest which thwarted lord Capel in all his measures. A motion was made in parliament to impeach the chancellor, for sowing dis∣cord and division among his majesty's subjects; but, being indulged with a hear∣ing by the house of commons, he justified himself so much to their satisfaction, that he was voted clear of all imputation, by a great majority. Nevertheless, they, at the end of the session, sent over an address, in which they bore testi∣mony to the mild and just administration of their lord-deputy.</P>

<P>King William having taken such steps as were deemed necessary for preserving the peace of England in his absence, crossed the sea to Holland in the middle of May, fully determined to make some great effort in the Nether∣lands, that might aggrandize his military character, and humble the power of France, which was already in the decline. That kingdom was actually exhausted in such a manner, that the haughty Lewis found himself obliged to stand upon the defensive against enemies over whom he had been used to triumph with uninterrupted success. He heard the clamours of his people, which he could not quiet; he saw his advances to peace rejected; and to crown his misfor∣tunes, he sustained an irreparable loss in the death of Francis de Montmorency, duke of Luxembourg, to whose military talents he owed the greatest part of his glory and success. That great general died in January at Versailles, in the sixty-seventh year of his age; and Lewis lamented his death the more deeply, as he had not another general left, in whose understanding he could confide. The conduct of the army in Flanders was intrusted to the marechal Villeroy; and Boufflers commanded a separate army, though subject to the other's orders. As the French king took it for granted, that the confederates would have a superiority of numbers in the field, and was well acquainted with the enter∣prising genius of their chief, he ordered a new line to be drawn between the Lys and the Scheld; a disposition to be made for covering Dunkirk, Ypres, Tournay, and Namur; and layed injunctions on his general to act solely on the defensive. Mean while, the confederates formed two armies in the Netherlands. The first consisted of seventy battalions of infantry, and eighty-two squadrons of horse and dragoons, chiefly English and Scots, encamped at Aerseele, Ca∣neghem, and Wanterghem, between Theildt and Deynse, to be commanded by the king in person assisted by the old prince of Vaudemont. The other army, composed of sixteen battalions of foot, and one hundred and thirty squadrons of horse, encamped at Zellich and Ham, on the road from Brussels to Dender∣monde, under the command of the elector of Bavaria, seconded by the duke of Holstein-Ploen. Major-general Ellemberg was posted near Dixmuyde with twenty battalions and ten squadrons; and another body of Brandenburg and Dutch troops, with a reinforcement from Liege, lay encamped on the Mehaigne,
<PB N="135" REF="1380"/>
under the conduct of the baron de Heyden, lieutenant-general of Bran∣denburg, and the count de Berlo, general of the Liege cavalry. King Wil∣liam arrived in the camp on the fifth day of July. After having remained eight days at Aerseele, he marched to Becelair, while Villeroy retired behind his lines between Menin and Ypres, after having detached ten thousand men to reinforce Boufflers, who had advanced to Pont-Espiere; but, he too retreated within his lines, when the elector of Bavaria passed the Scheld, and took post at Kirk∣hoven: at the same time the body under Heyden advanced towards Namur.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The king of England having by his motions drawn the forces of the enemy on the side of Flanders, directed the baron de Heyden and the earl of Athlone, who commanded forty squadrons from the camp of the elector of Bavaria, to invest Namur; and this service was performed on the third day of July: but, as the place was not intirely surrounded, marechal Boufflers threw himself into it, with such a reinforcement of dragoons as augmented the gar∣rison to the number of fifteen thousand chosen men. King William and the elector brought up the rest of the forces, which encamped on both sides of the Sambre and the Maeze; and the lines of circumvallation were begun on the sixth day of July, under the direction of the celebrated engineer general Coehorn. The place was formerly very strong both by situation and art; but, the French, since its last reduction, had made such additional works, that both the town and citadel seemed impregnable; and considering the number of the gar∣rison, and the quality of the troops, commanded by a marechal of France, dis∣tinguished by his valour and conduct, the enterprize was deemed an undeni∣able proof of William's temerity. On the eleventh the trenches were opened, and next day the batteries began to play with incredible fury. The king re∣ceiving intelligence of a motion made by a body of French troops, with a view to intercept the convoys, detached twenty squadrons of horse and dragoons to observe the enemy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>Prince Vaudemont, who was left at Rouselaer with fifty battalions and the like number of squadrons, understanding that Villeroy had passed the Lys, in order to attack him, took post with his left near Grammen, his right by Aerseele and Caneghem; and began to fortify his camp with a view to ex∣pect the enemy. Their vanguard appearing on the evening of the thirteenth at Dentreghem, he changed the disposition of his camp, and intrenched himself on both sides. Next day, however, perceiving Villeroy's design was to sur∣round him, by means of another body of troops commanded by Mr. Montal, who had already passed the Thieldt for that purpose, he resolved to avoid an engagement, and effected a retreat to Ghent, which is celebrated as one of the most capital efforts of military conduct. He forth with detached twelve battali∣ons and twelve pieces of cannon, to secure Newport, which Villeroy had intended to invest; but, that general now changed his resolution, and undertook the siege of Dixmuyde, garrisoned by eight battalions of foot and a regiment of dragoons, commanded by major-general Ellemberg, who in six and thirty hours after the trenches were opened, surrendered himself and his soldiers prisoners of war. This scandalous example was followed by colonel Ofarrel, who yielded up Deynse on the same shameful conditions, even before a battery wns opened by the besiegers. In the sequel they were both tried for their misbehaviour. El∣lemberg suffered death, and Ofarrel was broke with infamy. The prince of

Villeroy, after several marches and countermarches, appeared before Brussels, on the thirteenth day of August, and sent a letter to the prince of Berghem, governor of that city, importing, that the king his master had ordered him to bombard the town, by way of making reprisals for the damage done by the English fleet to the maritime towns of France: he likewise desired to know, in what part the electress of Bavaria resided, that he might not fire into that quarter. After this declaration, which was no more than an unmeaning compliment, he began to bombard and cannonade the place with red hot bullets, which produced consiagrations in many different parts of the city, and frightened the electre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s into a miscarriage. On the fifteenth, the French discontinued their firing, and retired to Enghien.</P>

<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>During these transactions, the siege of Namer was prosecuted with great ardour, under the eye of the king of England; while the garrison de∣fended the place with equal spirit and perseverance. On the eighteenth day of July, major-general Ramsay and the lord Cutts, at the head of five battalions, English, Scots, and Dutch, attacked the enemy's advanced works, on the right of the counterscarp. They were sustained by six English battalions, commanded by brigadier-general Fitzpatrick; while eight foreign regiments, with nine thou∣sand pioneers, advanced on the left, under major-general Salisch. The assault was desperate and bloody, the enemy maintaining their ground for two hours with und<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unted courage; but at last, they were obliged to give way, and were pursued to the very gates of the town, though not before they had killed or wounded twelve hundred men of the confederate army. The king was so well pleased with the behaviour of the British troops, that during the action he layed his hand upon the shoulder of the elector of Bavaria, and exclaimed with emo∣tion, "See my brave English!" On the twenty-seventh, the English and Scots, under Ramsay and Hamilton, assaulted the counterscarp, where they met with prodigious opposition from the fire of the besieged. Nevertheless, being sus∣tained by the Dutch, they made a lodgment on the foremost covered-way before the gate of St. Nicholas, as also upon part of the counterguard. The valour of the assailants on this occasion was altogether unprecedented, and almost in∣credible; while, on the other hand, the courage of the besieged was worthy of praise and admiration. Several persons were killed in the trenches at the side of the king, and among these Mr. Godfrey, deputy-governor of the bank of England, who had come to the camp to confer with his majesty about remitting money for the payment of the army. On the thirtieth day of July the elector of Bavaria attacked Vanbau's line that surrounded the works of the castle. Gene∣ral Coehorn was present in this action, which was performed with equal va∣lour and success. They not only broke through the line, but even took pos∣session of Coeborn's fort, in which, however, they found it impossible to effect a lodgment. On the second day of August, lord Cutts, with four hundred Eng∣lish and Dutch grenadiers, attacked the saillant-angle of a demi-bastion, and lodged himself on the second coun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erscarp. The breaches being now practica∣ble, and preparations made for a general affault, count Guiscard, the governor, capitulated for the town on the fourth of August; and the French retired into
<PB N="137" REF="1400"/>
the citadel, against which twelve batteries played, upon the thirteenth. The trenches, mean while, were carried on with great expedition, notwithstanding all the efforts of the besieged, who fired without ceasing, and exerted amazing diligence and intrepidity in defending and repairing the damage they sustained. At length, the annoyance became so dreadful from the unintermitting showers of bombs and red hot bullets, that Boufflers, after having made divers furious sallies, formed a scheme for breaking through the confederate camp with his cavalry. This, however, was prevented by the extreme vigilance of king William.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>After the bombardment of Brussels, Villeroy being reinforced with all the troops that could be draughted from garrisons, advanced towards Namur, with an army of ninety thousand men; and prince Vaudemont being joined by the prince of Hesse, with a strong body of forces from the Rhine, took possession of the strong camp at Mazy, within five English miles of the besieg∣ing army. The king, understanding that the enemy had reached Fleurus, where they discharged ninety pieces of cannon, as a signal to inform the garri∣son of their approach, left the conduct of the siege to the elector of Bavaria, and took upon himself the command of the covering-army, in order to oppose Villeroy, who being further reinforced by a detachment from Germany, de∣clared, that he would hazard a battle for the relief of Namur. But, when he viewed the posture of the allies near Mazy, he changed his resolution, and retired in the night without noise. On the thirtieth day of August, the besieged were summoned to surrender, by count Horn, who, in a parley with the count de Lamont, general of the French infantry, gave him to understand, that the marechal Villeroy had retired towards the Mehaigne; so that the garrison could not expect to be relieved. No immediate answer being returned to this mes∣sage, the parley was broke off; and the king resolved to proceed without delay to a general assault, which he had already planned with the elector and his other generals. Between one and two in the afternoon, lord Cutts, who desired the command, though it was not his turn of duty, rushed out of the trenches of the second line, at the head of three hundred grenadiers, to make a lodgment in the breach of Terra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nova, supported by the regiments of Coulthorp, Buchan, Hamilton, and Mackay; while colonel Marselly, with a body of Dutch, the Bavarians, and Brandenburgers, attacked at two other places. The assailants met with such a warm reception, that the English grenadiers were repulsed even after they had mounted the breach, lord Cutts being for some time disabled by a shot in the head. Marselly was defeated, taken, and afterwards killed by a cannon ball from the batteries of the besiegers. The Bavarians, by mistaking their way, were exposed to a terrible fire, by which their general count Rivera and great number of their officers were slain; nevertheless, they fixed them∣selves on the outward intrenchment on the point of the Coehorn next to the Sambre, and maintained their ground with amazing fortitude. Lord Cutts, when his wound was dressed, returned to the scene of action; and ordered two hundred chosen men of Mackay's regiment, commanded by lieutenant Cockle, to attack the face of the saillant-angle next to the breach, sword in hand, while the ensigns of the same regiment should advance and plant their colours on the palisadoes. Cockle and his detachment executed the command he had received with admirable intrepidity. They broke through the palisadoes, drove the French from the covered way, made a lodgment in one of the batteries, and
<PB N="138" REF="1410"/>
turned the cannon against the enemy. The Bavarians being thus sustained, made their post good. The majors-general la Cave and Schwerin lodged themselves at the same time on the covered-way; and although the general assault did not succeed in its full extent, the confederates remained masters of a very considerable lodgment, nearly an English mile in length. Yet this was dearly purchased with the lives of two thousand men, including many officers of great rank and reputation. During the action the elector of Bavaria signa∣lized his courage in a very remarkable manner, riding from place to place through the hottest of the fire, giving his directions with notable presence of mind, according to the emergency of circumstances, animating the officers with praise and promise of preferment, and distributing handfuls of gold among the private soldiers.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>On the first day of September, the besieged having obtained a cessa∣tion of arms that their dead might be buried, the count de Guiscard appear∣ing on the breach, desired to speak with the elector of Bavaria. His highness immediately mounting the breach, the French governor offered to surrender the fort of Coehorn; but was given to understand, that if he intended to capitulate, he must treat for the whole. This reply being communicated to Boufflers, he agreed to the proposal: the cessation was prolonged, and that very evening the capitulation was finished. Villeroy, who lay encamped at Gemblours, was no sooner apprised of this event, by a triple discharge of all the artillery, and a running fire along the lines of the confederate army, than he passed the Sambre near Charleroy, with great precipitation; and having reinforced the garrison of Dinant, retreated towards the lines in the neighbourhood of Mons. On the fifth day of September, the French garrison, which was now reduced from fifteen to five thousand five hundred men, evacuated the citadel of Namur; and Boufflers was arrested in the name of his Britannick majesty, by way of reprisal for the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse, which the French king had detained contrary to the cartel subsisting between the two nations. The marechal was not a little discomposed at this unexpected incident, and expostulated warmly with Mr. Dyckvelt, who assured him the king of Great-Britain entertained a profound respect for his person and character; and offered to set him at liberty, provided he would pass his word, that the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse should be sent back, or that he himself would return in a fortnight. He said, that he could not enter into any such engagement, as he did not know his master's reasons for detaining the garrisons in question. He was therefore re∣conveyed to Namur, from whence he was removed to Maestricht, and treated with great reverence and respect, till the return of an officer whom he had dis∣patched to Versailles with an account of his captivity. Then he engaged his word, that the garrisons of Dixmuyde and Deynse should be sent back to the allied army. He was immediately released, and conducted in safety to Dinant. When he repaired to Versailles, Lewis received him with very extraordinary marks of esteem and affection. He embraced him in public with the warmest expressions of regard; declared himself perfectly well satisfied with his conduct; created him duke and peer of France; and presented him with a very large sum, in acknowledgment of his signal services.</P>

<P>After the reduction of Namur, which greatly inhanced the military character of king William, he retired to his house at Loo, which was his favourite
<PB N="139" REF="1420"/>
place of residence, leaving the command to the elector of Bavaria. About the latter end of September both armies began to separate. The French forces retired within their lines. A good number of the allied troops were distri∣buted in different garrisons; and a strong detachment marched towards Newport, under the command of the prince of Wirtemberg, for the security of that place. Thus ended the campaign in the Netherlands. On the Rhine nothing of mo∣ment was attempted by either army. The marechal de Lorges in the beginning of June passed the Rhine at Philipsburg; and posting himself at Brucksal, sent out parties to ravage the country. On the eleventh day of the month the prince of Baden joined the German army at Steppach, and on the eighth of July was reinforced by the troops of the other German confederates, in the neighbour∣hood of Wiselock. On the nineteenth, the French retired without noise, in the night, towards Manheim, where they repassed the river without any interrup∣tion from the Imperial general: then he sent off a large detachment to Flan∣ders. The same step was taken by the prince of Baden; and each army lay inac∣tive in their quarters for the remaining part of the campaign. The command of the Germans in Hungary was conferred upon the elector of Saxony; but the court of Vienna was so dilatory in their preparations, that he was not in a con∣dition to act till the middle of August. Lord Paget had been sent ambassador from England to the Ottoman Porte, with instructions relating to a pacification; but, before he could obtain an audience, the sultan died, and was succeeded by his nephew Mustapha, who resolved to prosecute the war in person. The war-like genius of this new emperor afforded but an uncomfortable prospect to his people, considering that Peter, the czar of Muscovy, had taken the opportunity of the war in Hungary, to invade the Crimea, and besiege Azoph: so that the Tartars were too much employed at home to spare the succours which the sultan demanded. Nevertheless, Mustapha and his vizir took the field before the Im∣perialists could commence the operations of the campaign, passed the Danube, took Lippa and Titul by assault, stormed the camp of general Veterani, who was posted at Lugos with seven thousand men, and lost his life in the action. The infantry were cut in pieces, after having made a desperate defence; but the horse retreated to Carousebes, under the conduct of general Trusches. The Turks after this exploit retired to Orsowa. Their navy, mean while, surprised the Venetian fleet at Scio, where several ships of the republic were destroyed, and they recovered that island, which the Venetians thought proper to abandon; but, in order to ballance this misfortune, these last obtained a complete victory over the bashaw of Negropont, in the Morea.</P>

<P>The French king still maintained a secret negotiation with the duke of Savoy, whose conduct had been for some time mysterious and equivocal. Contrary to the opinion of his allies, he undertook the siege of Casal, which was counted one of the strongest fortifications in Europe, defended by a nume∣rous garrison, abundantly supplied with ammunition and provision. The siege was begun about the middle of May; and the place was surrendered by capitu∣lation in about fourteen days, to the astonishment of the confederates, who did not know that this was a sacrifice by which the French court obtained the duke's forbearance during the remaining part of the campaign. The capitulation im∣ported, That the place should be restored to the duke of Mantua, who was the rightful proprietor: That the fortifications should be demolished at the expence
<PB N="140" REF="1430"/>
of the allies: that the garrison should remain in the fort until that work should be completed; and hostages were exchanged for the performance of these con∣ditions. The duke understood the art of procrastination so well, that Septem∣ber was far advanced before the place was wholly dismantled; and then he was seized with an ague which obliged him to quit the army.</P>

<P>In Catalonia the French could hardly maintain the footing they had gained. Admiral Russel, who wintered at Cadiz, was created admiral, chief∣commander, and captain-general of all his majesty's ships employed, or to be em∣ployed in the Narrow seas, and in the Mediterranean. He was reinforced by four thousand five hundred soldiers, under the command of brigadier-general Stewart; and seven thousand men, Imperialists as well as Spaniards, were draughted from Italy for the defence of Catalonia. These forces were transported to Barcelona, under the convoy of admiral Nevil, detached by Russel for that purpose. The affairs of Catalonia had already changed their aspect. Several French parties had been defeated. The Spaniards had blocked up Ostalric and Castel-Follit: Noailles had been recalled, and the command devolved to the duke de Vendome, who no sooner understood that the forces from Italy were landed, than he dis∣mantled Ostalric and Castel-Follit, and retired to Palamos. The viceroy of Catalonia, and the English admiral having resolved to give battle to the enemy, and reduce Palamos, the English troops were landed on the ninth day of August, and the allied army advanced to Palamos. The French appeared in order of bat∣tle; but the viceroy declined an engagement. Far from attacking the enemy, he withdrew his forces, and the town was bombarded by the admiral. The miscar∣riage of this expedition was in a great measure owing to a misunderstanding be∣tween Russel and the court of Spain. The admiral complained, that his catho∣lic majesty had made no preparations for the campaign: that he had neglected to fulfil his engagements with respect to the Spanish squadron, which ought to have joined the fleets of England and Holland: and, that he had taken no care to provide tents and provision for the British forces. On the twenty-seventh day of August he sailed for the coast of Provence, where his fleet was endar∣gered by a terrible tempest; then he steered down the Streights, and towards the latter end of September arrived in the bay of Cadiz. Then he left a number of ships under the command of Sir David Mitchel, until he should be joined by Sir George Rooke, who was expected from England, and returned home with the rest of the combined squadrons.</P>

<P>While admiral Russel asserted the British dominion in the Mediter∣ranean sea, the French coasts were again insulted in the channel by a separate fleet, under the command of lord Berkely of Stratton, assisted by the Dutch admiral Allemonde. On the fourth day of July they anchored before St. Malo's, which they bombarded from nine ketches covered by some frigates, which sustained more damage than was done to the enemy. On the sixth, Granville underwent the same fate; and then the fleet returned to Portsmouth. The bomb-vessels being refitted, the fleet sailed round to the Downs, where four hundred soldiers were embarked for an attempt upon Dunkirk, under the direction of Meesters, the famous Dutch engineer, who had prepared his infer∣nals, and other machines for the service. On the first day of August the expe∣riment was tried without success. The bombs did some execution; but, two smoke-ships miscarried, and the French had secured the Risbank and wooden
<PB N="141" REF="1440"/>
forts, with piles, booms, chains, and floating batteries, in such a manner, that the machine-vessels could not approach near enough to produce any effect. Be∣sides, the councils of the assailants were distracted by violent animosities. The English officers hated Meesters, because he was a Dutchman, and had acquired some credit with the king: he, on the other hand, treated them with disrespect. He retired with his machines in the night, and refused to co-operate with lord Berkely in his design upon Calais, which was now put in execution. On the sixteenth he rought his batteries to bear upon this place, and set fire to it in different quarters; but, the enemy had taken such precautions as rendered his scheme abortive.</P>

<P>A squadron had been sent to the West-Indies under the joint-com∣mand of captain Robert Wilmot and colonel Lilingston, with twelve hundred land-forces. They had instructions to co-operate with the Spaniards in His∣paniola, against the French settlements on that island, and to destroy their fish∣eries on the banks of Newfoundland, in their return. They were accordingly joined by seventeen hundred Spaniards raised by the president of St. Domingo; but, instead of proceeding against Petit-Guavas, according to the directions they had received, Wilmot took possession of Fort-Francois, and plundered the country for his own private advantage, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Lilingston, who protested against his conduct. In a word, the sea and land-officers lived in a state of perpetual dissension; and both became extremely disagreeable to the Spaniards, who soon renounced all connexion with them and their designs. In the beginning of September the commodore set sail for England, and lost one of his ships in the gulph of Florida. He himself died in the passage, and the greater part of the men being swept off by an epidemical distemper, the squadron returned to Britain in a most miserable condition. Not∣withstanding the great efforts the nation had made to maintain such a number of different squadrons for the protection of commerce, as well as to annoy the enemy, the trade suffered severely from the French privateers, which swarmed in both channels, and made prize of many rich vessels. The marquis of Car∣maerthen being stationed with a squadron off the Scilly islands, mistook a fleet of merchant-ships for the Brest-fleet, and retired with precipitation to Milford-Haven. In conseqence of this retreat, the privateers took a good number of ships from Barbadoes, and five from the East-Indies, valued at a million sterling. The merchants renewed their clamour against the commissioners of the admi∣ralty, who produced their orders and instructions in their own defence. The marquis of Carmaerthen had been guilty of flagrant misconduct on this occa∣sion; but, the chief source of those national calamities was the circumstantial intelligence transmitted to France from time to time, by the malcontents of England; for, they were actuated by a scandalous principle which they still retain, namely, that of rejoicing in the distress of their country.</P>

<P>King William, after having conferred with the states of Holland, and the elector of Brandenburg, who met him at the Hague, embarked for England on the ninteenth day of October, and arrived in safety at Margate, from whence he proceeded to London, where he was received as a conqueror, amidst the rejoicings and acclamations of the people. On that same day he sum∣moned a council at Kensington, in which it was determined to convoke a new parliament. While the nation was in good humour, it was supposed that they
<PB N="142" REF="1450"/>
would return such members only as were well affected to the government; whereas the present parliament might proceed in its inquiries into corruption and other grievances, and be the less influenced by the crown, as their depen∣dance was of such short duration. The parliament was therefore dissolved by proclamation, and a new one summoned to meet at Westminster on the twenty∣second day of November. While the whole nation was occupied in the elec∣tions, William, by the advice of his chief confidents, layed his own disposition under restraint, in another effort to acquire popularity. He honoured the di∣versions of Newmarket with his presence, and there received a compliment of congratulation from the university of Cambridge. Then he visited the earls of Sunderland, Northampton, and Montague, at their different houses in the country; and proceeded with a splendid retinue to Lincoln, from whence he repaired to Welbeck, a seat belonging to the duke of Newcastle in Nottin∣ghamshire, where he was attended by Dr. Sharp, archbishop of York, and his clergy. He lodged one night with lord Brooke at Warwick-castle, dined with the duke of Shrewsbury at Eyefort, and, by the way of Woodstock, made a so∣lemn entry into Oxford, having been met at some distance from the city by the duke of Ormond, as chancellor of the university, the vice-chancellor, the doctors in their habits, and the magistrates in their formalities. He proceeded directly to the theatre, where he was welcomed in an elegant Latin speech; and received from the chancellor on his knees, the usual presents of a large English Bible, and book of Common-Prayer, the cuts of the university, and a pair of gold-fringe gloves. The conduits ran with wine, and a magnificent banquet was prepared; but, an anonymous letter being found in the street, importing, that there was a design to poison his majesty, William refused to eat or drink in Oxford, and retired immediately to Windsor. Notwithstanding this abrupt departure, which did not savour much of magnanimity, the university chose Sir William Trumbal secretary of state, as one of their representatives in par∣liament.</P>

<P>The Whig-interest generally prevailed in the elections, though many even of that party were malcontents; and when the parliament met, Foley was again chosen speaker of the commons. The king in his first speech extolled the valour of the English forces; expressed his concern at being obliged to demand such large supplies from his people; observed, that the funds had proved very deficient, and the civil list was in a precarious condition; recommended to their compassion the miserable situation of the French protestants; took notice of the bad state of the coin; desired they would form a good bill for the encou∣ragement and increase of seamen; and contrive laws for the advancement of commerce. He mentioned the great preparations which the French were making for taking the field early; intreated them to use dispatch; expressed his satisfaction at the choice which his people had made of their representatives in the house of commons; and exhorted them to proceed with temper and unani∣mity. Though the two houses presented addresses of congratulation to the king, upon his late success, and promised to assist him in prosecuting the war with vigour, the nation loudly exclaimed against the intolerable burthens and losses to which they were subjected, by a foreign scheme of politics, which, like an unfathomable abyss, swallowed up the wealth and blood of the kingdom. All the king's endeavours to cover the disgusting side of his character had
<PB N="143" REF="1460"/>
proved ineffectual: he was still dry, reserved, and forbidding; and the malcon∣tents inveighed bitterly against his behaviour to the princess Anne of Den∣mark. When the news of Namur's being reduced arrived in England, she congratulated him upon his success in a dutiful letter: to which he would not deign to send a reply, either by writing or message; nor had she or her hus∣band been favoured with the slightest mark of regard since his return to Eng∣land. The members in the lower-house, who had adopted opposing maxims, either from principle or resentment, relolved, That the crown should purchase the supplies with some concession in favour of the people. They therefore brought in the so long contested bill for regulating trials in cases of high-trea∣son, and misprision of treason; and, considering the critical juncture of affairs, the courtiers were afraid of obstructing such a popular measure. The lords inserted a clause, enacting, That a peer should be tried by the whole peerage; and the commons at once assented to this amendment. The bill provided, That persons indicted for high-treason, or misprision of treason, should be furnished with a copy of the indictment five days before the trial; and indulged with counsel to plead in their defence: That no person should be indicted but upon the oaths of two lawful witnesses swearing to overt-acts: That in two or more distinct treasons of divers kinds, alledged in one bill of indictment, one witness to one, and another witness to another, should not be deemed two witnesses: That no person should be prosecuted for any such crime, unless the indictment be found within three years after the offence committed, except in case of a design or attempt to assassinate or poison the king, where this limi∣tation should not take place: That persons indicted for treason, or mis∣prision of treason, should be supplied with copies of the panel of the jurors, two days at least before the trial, and have process to compel their witnesses to appear: That no evidence should be admitted of any over-act not expresly laid in the indictment: That this act should not extend to any impeachment, or other proceedings in parliament; nor to any indictment for counterfeiting his majesty's coin, his great-seal, privy-seal, sign-manual, or signet.</P>

<P>This important affair being discussed, the commons proceeded to examine the accompts and estimates, and voted above five millions for the ser∣vice of the ensuing year. The state of the coin was by this time become such a national grievance as could not escape the attention of parliament. The lords prepared an address to the throne, for a proclamation to put a stop to the currency of diminished coin; and to this they desired the concurrence of the commons. The lower-house, however, determined to take this affair under their own inspection. They appointed a committee of the whole house, to deliberate on the state of the nation with respect to the currency. Great op∣position was made to a recoinage, which was a measure strenuously recom∣mended and supported by Mr. Montague, who acted on this occasion by the advice of the great mathematician Sir Isaac Newton. The enemies of this ex∣pedient argued, that should the silver coin be called in, it would be impossible to maintain the war abroad, or prosecute foreign trade, inasmuch as the mer∣chant could not pay his bills of exchange, nor the soldier receive his sub∣sistence: that a stop would be put to all mutual payment; and this would pro∣duce universal confusion and despair. Such a reformation could not be effected without some danger and difficulty; but it was become absolutely necessary, as the evil daily encreased, and in a little time must have terminated in national
<PB N="144" REF="1470"/>
anarchy. After long and vehement debates, the majority resolved to proceed with all possible expedition to a new coinage. Another question arose, Whether the new coin, in its different denominations, should retain the original weight and purity of the old; or the established standard be raised in value? The famous Locke engaged in this dispute against Mr. Lowndes, who proposed that the standard should be raised; and his arguments were so convincing, that the committee resolved the established standard should be preserved with re∣spect to weight and fineness. They likewise resolved, That the loss ac∣cruing to the revenue from clipped money, should be borne by the public. In order to prevent a total stagnation, they further resolved, That, after an ap∣pointed day, no clipped money should pass in payment, except to the collectors of the revenue and taxes, or upon loans or payments into the exchequer: That, after another day to be appointed, no clipped money of any sort should pass in any payment whatsoever; and that a third day should be fixed for all persons to bring in their clipped money to be recoined, after which they should have no allowance upon what they might offer. They addressed the king to issue a proclamation agreeable to these resolutions; and, on the nineteenth day of December, it was published accordingly. Such were the fears of the people, augmented and inflamed by the enemies of the government, that all payment immediately ceased, and a face of distraction appeared through the whole community. The adversaries of the bill seized this opportunity to aggravate the apprehensions of the public. They inveighed against the ministry, as the authors of this national grievance: they levelled their satire particularly at Montague; and it required uncommon fortitude and address to avert the most dangerous consequences of popular discontent. The house of commons agreed to the following resolutions, That twelve hundred thousand pounds should be raised by a duty on glass-windows, to make up the loss on the clipped money: That the recompence for supplying the deficiency of clipped money should ex∣tend to all silver coin, though of a coarser alloy than the standard: That the collectors and receivers of his majesty's aids and revenues should be enjoined to receive all such monies: That a reward of five pounds per cent. should be given to all such persons as should bring in either milled or broad unclipped money, to be applied in exchange of the clipped money throughout the king∣dom: That a reward of three pence per ounce should be given to all persons who should bring in wrought plate to the mint to be coined: That persons might pay in their whole next year's land tax in clipped money, at one convenient time to be appointed for that purpose: That commissioners should be appointed in every county to pay and distribute the milled and broad unclipped money, and the new coined money in lieu of that which was diminished. A bill being prepared agreeable to these determinations, was sent up to the house of lords, who made some amendments, which the com∣mons rejected: but, in order to avoid cavils and conferences, they dropped the bill, and brought in another, without the clauses which the lords had in∣serted. They were again proposed in the upper-house, and over-ruled by the majority; and, on the twenty-first day of January, the bill received the royal assent, together with another bill, enlarging the time for purchasing annuities, and continuing the duties on low wines. At the same time, the king passed the bill of trials for high treason, and an act to prevent mercenary elections. Divers merchants and traders petitioned the house of commons, that the losses
<PB N="145" REF="1480"/>
in their trade and payments, occasioned by the rise of guineas, might be taken into consideration. A bill was immediately brought in for taking off the obligation and encouragement for coining guineas, for a certain time: and then the commons proceeded to lower the value of this coin; a task in which they m t with great opposition from some members, who alledged that it would foment the popular disturbances. At length, however, the majority agreed, that a guinea should be lowered from thirty to eight and twenty shillings; afterwards to six and twenty; at length a clause was inserted in the bill, for en∣couraging people to bring plate to the mint, settling the price of a guinea at two and twenty shillings, and it naturally sunk to its original value of twenty shillings and sixpence. Many persons, however, supposing that the price of gold would be raised in the next session, hoarded up their guineas; and, upon the same supposition, encouraged by the malcontents, the new coined silver-money was reserved, to the great detriment of commerce. The king ordered mints to be erected in York, Bristol, Exeter, and Chester, for the purpose of the recoinage, which was executed with unexpected success; so that, in less than a year, the currency of England, which had been the worst, became the best coin in Europe.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>At this period, the attention of the commons was diverted to an object of a more private nature. The earl of Portland, who enjoyed the greatest share of the king's favour, had obtained a grant of some lordships in Derbyshire; and, while the warrant was depending, the gentlemen of that county resolved to oppose it with all their power. In consequence of a peti∣tion, they were indulged with a hearing by the lords of the treasury. Sir William Williams, in the name of the rest, alledged, that the lordships in question were the antient demesnes of the prince of Wales, absolutely unalien∣able: that the revenues of those lordships supported the government of Wales in paying the judges and other salaries: that the grant was of too large an ex∣tent for any foreign subject: and that the people of the county were too great to be subject to any foreigner. Sundry other substantial reasons were used against the grant, which, notwithstanding all their remonstrances, would have passed through the offices, had not the Welsh gentlemen addressed themselves by petition to the house of commons. Upon this occasion, Mr. Price, a mem∣ber of the house, harrangued with great severity against the Dutch in general, and did not even abstain from sarcasms upon the king's person, title, and go∣vernment. The objections started by the petitioners being duly considered, were found so reasonable, that the commons presented an address to the king, representing, That those manours had been usually annexed to the principality of Wales, and settled on the princes of Wales for their support: That many persons in those parts held their estates by royal tenure, under great and valu∣able compositions, rents, royal payments, and services to the crown and princes of Wales, and enjoyed great privileges and advantages under such tenure. They therefore besought his majesty to recal the grant, which was in dimi∣nution of the honour and interest of the crown; and prayed, that the said manours and lands might not be alienated without the consent of parliament. This address met with a cold reception from the king, who promised to recall the grant which had given such offence to the commons; and said he would find some other way of shewing his favour to the earl of Portland.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The people in general entertained a national aversion to this nobleman; and the malcontents inculcated a notion that he made use of his interest and intelligence to injure the trade of England, that the commerce of his own country might flourish without competition. To his suggestions they imputed the act and patent in favour of the Scottish company, which was sup∣posed to have been thrown in as a bone of contention between the two king∣doms. The subject was first started in the house of lords, who invited the commons to a conference: a committee was appointed to examine into the particulars of the act for erecting the Scottish company; and the two houses presented a joint address against it, as a scheme that would prejudice all the subjects concerned in the wealth and trade of the English nation. They represented, that, in consequence of the exemption from taxes, and other ad∣vantages granted to the Scottish company, that kingdom would become a free port for all East and West India commodities; the Scots would be enabled to supply all Europe at a cheaper rate than the English could afford to sell their merchandise for; therefore England would lose the benefit of its foreign trade: besides, the Scots would smuggle their commodities into England, to the great detriment of his majesty and his customs. To this remonstrance the king replied, That he had been ill served in Scotland, but that he hoped some re∣medies would be found to prevent the inconveniencies of which they were ap∣prehensive. In all probability he had been imposed upon by the ministry of that kingdom; for, in a little time, he discarded the marquis of Tweedale, and dismissed both the Scottish secretaries of state, in lieu of whom he ap∣pointed lord Murray, son to the marquis of Athole. Notwithstanding the king's answer, the committee proceeded on the inquiry, and, in consequence of their report, confirming a petition from the East India company, the house resolved, That the directors of the Scottish company were guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour, in administering and taking an oath de fideli in this kingdom; and that they should be impeached for the same. Mean while, Ro∣derick Mackenzie, from whom they had received their chief information, be∣gan to retract his evidence, and was ordered into custody: but he made his escape, and could not be retaken, although the king, at their request, issued a proclamation for that purpose. The Scots were extremely incensed against the king, when they understood he had disowned their company, from which they had promised themselves such wealth and advantage. The settlement of Da∣rien was already planned, and afterwards put in execution; though it mis∣carried in the sequel, and had like to have produced abundance of mischief.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The complaints of the English merchants who had suffered by the war, was so loud at this juncture, that the commons resolved to take their case into consideration. The house resolved itself into a committee to consider the state of the nation with regard to commerce, and having duly weighed all circumstances, agreed to the following resolutions, That a council of trade should be established by act of parliament, with powers to take measures for the more effectual preservations of commerce: That the commissioners should be nominated by parliament, but none of them have seats in the house: that they should take an oath, acknowledging the title of king William as rightful and lawful; and abjuring the pretensions of James, or any other person. The king considered these resolutions as an open attack upon
<PB N="147" REF="1500"/>
his prerogative, and signified his displeasure to the earl of Sunderland, who patronized this measure; but it was so popular in the house, that in all pro∣bability it would have been put in execution, had not the attention of the com∣mons been at this period diverted from it by the detection of a new conspiracy. The friends of king James had, upon the death of queen Mary, renewed their practices for effecting a restoration of that monarch, on the supposition that the interest of William was considerably weakened by the decease of his con∣sort. Certain individuals, whose zeal for James overshot their discretion, formed a design to seize the person of king William and convey him to France, or put him to death, in case of resistance. They had sent emissaries to the court of St. Germains to demand a commission for this purpose, which was refused. The earl of Aylesbury, lord Montgomery, son to the marquis of Powis, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend, captain Charnock, captain Porter, and one Mr. Goodman, were the first contrivers of this project. Charnock was detached with a proposal to James, that he should procure a body of horse and foot from France, to make a descent in England, and they would engage not only to join him at his landing, but even to replace him on the throne of England. These offers being declined by James, on pretence that the French king could not spare such a number of troops at that juncture, the earl of Aylesbury went over in person, and was admitted to a conference with Lewis, in which the scheme of an invasion was actually concerted. In the beginning of February, the duke of Berwick repaired privately to England, where he conferred with the conspirators, assured them that king James was ready to make a descent with a considerable number of French forces, distributed commissions, and gave directions for providing men, arms, and horses, to join him at his arrival. When he returned to France, he found every thing pre∣pared for the expedition. The troops were drawn down to the sea-side; a great number of transports were assembled at Dunkirk; Monsieur Gabaret had advanced as far as Calais with a squadron of ships, which, when joined by that of Du Bart at Dunkirk, was judged a sufficient convoy; and James had come as far as Calais, in his way to embark. Mean while, the Jacobites in England were assiduously employed in making preparations for a revolt. Sir John Friend had very near completed a regiment of horse. Considerable pro∣gress was made in levying another by Sir William Perkins. Sir John Fen∣wick had enlisted four troops. Colonel Tempest had undertaken for one re∣giment of dragoons; colonel Parker was preferred to the command of another; Mr. Curzon was commissioned for a third; and the malcontents intended to raise a fourth in Suffolk, where their interest chiefly prevailed.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>While one part of the Jacobites proceeded against William in the usual way of exciting an insurrection, another, consisting of the most desperate conspirators, had formed a scheme of assassination. Sir George Bar∣clay, a native of Scotland, who had served as an officer in the army of James, a man of undaunted courage, a furious bigot in the religion of Rome, yet close, circumspect, and determined, was landed, with other officers, in Rom∣ney-marsh, by one captain Gill, about the beginning of January, and is said to have undertaken the task of seizing or assassinating king William. He imparted his design to Harrison, alias Johnston, a priest, Charnock, Porter, and Sir William Perkins, by whom it was approved; and pretended to have a particular commission for this service. After various consultations, they re∣solved
<PB N="148" REF="1510"/>
to attack the king on his return from Richmond, where he commonly hunted on Saturdays; and the scene of their ambus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade was a lane between Brentford and Turnham-green. As it would be necessary to charge and dis∣perse the guards that attended the coach, they agreed that their number should be increased to forty horsemen, and each conspirator began to engage proper persons for the enterprise. When their complement was full, they determined to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cute their purpose on the fifteenth day of February. They concerted the manner in which they should meet in small parties without suspicion, and waited with impatience for the hour of action. In this interval, some of the underling actors, seized with horror at the reflection of what they had under∣taken, or captivated with the prospect of reward, resolved to prevent the exe∣cution of the design by a timely discovery. On the eleventh day of February, one Fisher informed the earl of Portland of the scheme, and named some of the conspirat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs; but his account was imperfect. On the thirteenth, however, he returned with a circumstantial detail of all the particulars. Next day, the earl was accosted by one Pendergrass, an Irish officer, who told his lordship he had just come from Hampshire, at the request of a particular friend, and under∣stood that he had been called up to town with a view of engaging him in a design to assassmate king William. He said, he had promised to embark in the undertaking, though he detested it in his own mind, and took this first op∣portunity of revealing the secret, which was of such consequence to his ma∣jesty's life. He owned himself a roman catholic, but declared, that he did not think any religion could justify such a treacherous purpose. At the same time he observed, that as he lay under obligations to some of the conspirators, his honour and gratitude would not permit him to accuse them by name; and that he would upon no consideration appear as an evidence. The king had been so much used to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ictitious plots, and false discoveries, that he payed little regard to these informations, until they were confirmed by the testimony of another conspirator called La Rue, a Frenchman, who communicated the same particulars to brigadier Levison, without knowing the least circumstance of the other discoveries. Then the king believed there was something real in the conspiracy; and Pendergrass and La Rue were severally examined in his pre∣sence. He thanked Pendergrass in particular for this instance of his probity, but observed, that it must prove ineffectual, unless he would discover the names of the conspirators; for, without knowing who they were, he should not be able to secure his life against their attempts. At length Pendergrass was pre∣vailed upon to give a li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of those he knew, yet not before the king had so∣lemnly promised that he should not be used as an evidence against them, but with his own consent. As the king did not go to Richmond on the day ap∣pointed, the conspirators postponed the execution of their design till the Sa∣turday following. They accordingly met at different houses on the Friday, when every man received his instructions. There they agreed, that after the per∣petration of the parricide, they should ride in a body as far as Hammersmith, and then dispersing, enter London by different avenues. But, on the morn∣ing, when they understood that the guards were returned to their quarters, and the king's coaches sent back to the Mews, they were seized with a sudden damp, on the supposition that their plot was discovered. Sir George Barclay withdrew himself, and every one began to think of providing for his own safety. Next night, however, a good number of them was apprehended, and then
<PB N="149" REF="1520"/>
he whole discovery was communicated to the privy-council. A proclamation was issued against those that absconded; and great diligence was used to find Sir George Barclay, who was supposed to have a particular commission from James for assassinating the prince of Orange; but, he made good his retreat, and it was never proved that any such commission had been granted.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>This design and the projected invasion proved equally abortive. James had scarce reached Calais, when the duke of Wirtemberg dispatched his aid-de camp from Flanders to king William, with an account of the purposed descent. Expresses with the same tidings arrived from the elector of Bavaria and the prince de Vaudemont. Two considerable squadrons being ready for sea, admiral Russel embarked at Spithead, and stood over to the French coast with above fifty sail of the line. The enemy were confounded at his appearance; they hauled in their vessels under the shore, in such shallow water that he could not follow and destroy them, but he absolutely ruined their design, by cooping them up in their harbours. King James, after having tarried some weeks at Calais, returned to St. Germains. The forces were sent back to the garrisons from which they had been draughted; and the people of France exclaimed, that the malignant star which ruled the destiny of James, had blasted this and every other project formed for his restoration. By means of the reward offered in the proclamation, the greater part of the conspirators were betrayed or taken. George Harris, who had been sent from France, with orders to obey Sir George Barclay, surrendered himself to Sir William Trumball, and confessed the scheme of assassination in which he had been engaged. Porter and Pendergrass were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p∣prehended together. This last insisted upon the king's promise, that he should not be compelled to give evidence; but, when Porter owned himself guilty, the other observed, he was no longer bound to be silent, as his friend had made a confession; and they were both admitted as evidences for the crown.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>After their examination, the king, in a speech to both houses, com∣municated the nature of the conspiracy against his life, as well as the advices he had received touching the invasion: he explained the steps he had taken to defeat the double design, and professed his confidence in their readiness and zeal to concur with him in every thing that should appear necessary for their common safety. That same evening the two houses waited upon him at Ken∣sington, in a body, with an affectionate address, by which they expressed their abhorrence of the villanous and barbarous design which had been formed against his sacred person, of which they besought him to take more than ordi∣nary care. They assured him, they would to their utmost desend his life, and support his government, against the late king James, and all other enemies; and declared, that in case his majesty should come to a violent death, they would revenge it upon his adversaries and their adherents. He was extre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely well pleased with this warm address, and assured them, in his turn, he would take all opportunities of recommending himself to the continuance of their loyalty and affection. The commons forthwith impowered him by bill, to secure all persons suspected of conspiring against his person and government. They brought in another, providing, That in case of his majesty's death, the parliament then in being should continue until dissolved by the next heir in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ession to the crown, established by act of parliament: and, That if his ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y should chance to die between two parliaments, that which had been last

Several members neglecting to comply with this injunction within the limited time, the speaker was ordered to write to those who were in the country, and demand a pere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tory answer, while the clerk of the house attended such as pretended to be ill in town. The absentees finding themselves pressed in this manner, thought proper to sail with the stream, and sign the association, which was presented to the king by the commons in a body, with a request that it might be lodged among the records in the Tower, as a perpetual memorial of their loyalty and affection. The king received them with uncommon complacency; declared, that he heartily entered into the same association; that he should be always ready to venture his life with his good subjects, against all who should endea∣vour to subvert the religion, laws, and liberties of England; and he promised, that this, and all other associations should be lodged among the records in the Tower of London. Next day the commons resolved, That whoever should affirm an association was illegal, should be deemed a promoter of the designs of the late king James, and an enemy to the laws and liberties of the kingdom. The lords followed the example of the lower house in drawing up an association; but, the earls of Nottingham, Sir Edward Seymour, and Mr. Finch, objected to the words<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rightful, and Lawful, as applied to his majesty. They said, as the crown and its prerogatives were vested in him, they would yield obedience, though they could not acknowledge him as their rightful and lawful king. No∣thing could be more absured than this distinction started by men who had actually constituted part of the administration; unless they supposed that the right of king William expired with queen Mary. The earl of Rochester proposed an expedient in favour of such tender consciences, by altering the words that gave offence; and this was adopted accordingly. Fifteen of the peers, and ninety∣two commoners signed the association with reluctance. It was, however, subscribed by all sorts of people in different parts of the kingdom; and the bi∣shops<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burner. Oldm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on. Boyer. Tindal. Ralph. L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves of the Admirals.</NOTE> drew up a form for the clergy, which was signed by a great majority. The commons brought in a bill, declaring all men incapable of public trust, or of sitting in parliament, who would not engage in this association. At the same time, the council issued an order for renewing all the commissions in Eng¦land, that those who had not signed it voluntarily should be dismissed from the service as disaffected persons.</P>

<P>After these warm demonstrations of loyalty, the commons pro∣ceeded upon ways and means for raising the supplies. A new bank was con∣stituted as a fund, upon which the sum of two millions, five hundred and sixty∣four thousand pounds should be raised; and it was called the Land-bank, be∣cause established on land securities. This scheme, said to have been projected
<PB N="151" REF="1540"/>
by the famous doctor Chamberlain, was patronized by the earl of Sunderland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1696.</NOTE> and managed by Foley and Harley: so that it seemed to be a Tory plan, which Sunderland supported, in order to reconcile himself to that party. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The commons resolved, That a fund re∣deemable by parliament be settled in a nati∣onal land-bank, to be raised by new subscrip∣tions: That no person be concerned in both banks at the same time: That the duties upon coals, culm, and tonnage of ships, be taken off, from the seventeenth day of March: That the sum of two millions, five hundred and sixty-four thousand pounds, be raised on this perpetual fund, redeemable by parliament: That the new bank should be restrained from lending money but upon land-securities, or to the government in the exchequer: That for making up the fund of interest for the capital stock, certain duties upon glass-wares, stone, and earthen bottles, granted before to the king for a term of years, be continued to his majesty, his heirs, and successors: That a further duty be layed upon stone and earthen ware, and another upon tobacco-pipes. This bank was to lend out five hundred thousand pounds a-year upon land securities, at three pounds and ten shillings per cent. per annum, and to cease and determine, unless the subscription should be full by the first day of August next ensuing.</P>
<P>The most remarkable laws enacted in this ses∣sion were these: An act for voiding all the elec∣tions of parliament-men, at which the elected had been at any expence in meat, drink, or mo∣ney, to procure votes.

This law was in bar of a custom that had pre∣vailed in that country. The widows and younger children claimed a share of the effects, called their Reasonable part, although the effects had been otherwise disposed of by will or deed. The par∣liament likewise passed an act, for preventing the exportation of wool, and encourage the impor∣tation thereof from Ireland. An act for encouraging the linen manufactures of Ireland. An act for regu∣lating juries. An act for encouraging the Green∣land trade. An act of indulgence to the quakers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that their solemn affirmation should be accepted instead of an oath. and, An Act for continuing certain other acts that were near expiring. An∣other bill had passed, for the better regulating elections for members of parliament; but, the royal assent was denied.

<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Before this period some of the conspirators had been brought to trial. The first who suffered was Robert Charnock, one of the two fellows of Magdalen-college, who in the reign of James had renounced the protestant re∣ligion, lieutenant King, and Thomas Keys, who had been formerly a trum∣peter, but of late servant to captain Porter. They were found guilty of high∣treason, and executed at Tyburn. They delivered papers to the sheriff, in which they solemnly declared, that they had never seen or heard of any commission from king James for assassinating the prince of Orange: Charnock in particu∣lar observed, that he had received frequent assurances of the king'shaving rejected such proposals when they had been offered; and that there was no other com∣mission but that for levying war in the usual form. Sir John Friend and Sir William Perkins were tried in April. The first from mean beginnings had acquired great wealth and credit, and always firmly adhered to the interests of king James. The other was likewise a man of fortune, violently attached to the same principles, though he had taken the oaths to the present go∣vernment, as one of the six clerks in chancery. Porter and Blair another evidence, deposed, that Sir John Friend had been concerned in levying men under a commission from king James; and, that he knew of the assassination<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="152" REF="1550"/>
plot, though not engaged in it as a personal actor. He endeavoured to invali∣date the testimony of Blair, by proving him guilty of the most shocking ingra∣titude. He observed, that both the evidences were reputed papists. The cu∣rate of Hackney, who officiated as chaplain in the prisoner's house, declared upon oath, that after the revolution he used to pray for king William; and, that he had often heard Sir John Friend say, that though he could not comply with the present government, he would live peaceably under it, and never en∣gage in any conspiracy. Mr. Hoadley, father of the present bishop of Win∣chester, added, that the prisoner was a good protestant, and frequently expressed his detestation of king-killing principles. Friend himself owned, he had been with some of the conspirators at a meeting in Leadenhall-street, but heard nothing of raising men, or any design against the government. He likewise affirmed, that a consultation to levy war was not treason; and, that his being at a treasonable consult, could amount to no more than a misprision of treason. Lord-chief-justice Holt declared, that although a bare conspiracy or design to levy war, was not treason within the statute of Edward III. yet, if the design or conspiracy be to kill, or depose, or imprison the king, by the means of levying war, then the consultation and conspiracy to levy war becomes high-treason, though no war be actually levied. The same inference might have been drawn against the authors and instruments of the revolution. The judge's explanation influenced the jury, who after some deliberation found the prisoner guilty. Next day Sir William Perkins was brought to the bar, and upon the testimony of Porter, Ewebank his own groom, and Haywood, a notorious informer, con∣victed of having been concerned, not only in the invasion, but also in the de∣sign against the king's life. The evidence was scanty, and the prisoner having been bred to the law, made an artful and vigorous defence; but, the judge acted as counsel for the crown, and the jury, by the hints they received from the bench. He and Sir John Friend underwent the sentence of death, and suffered at Tyburn on the third day of April. Friend protested before God, that he knew of no immediate descent purposed by king James, and therefore had made no preparations: that he was utterly ignorant of the assassination-scheme: that he died in the communion of the church of England, and layed down his life chearfully in the cause for which he suffered. Perkins declared, upon the word of a dying man, that the tenour of the king's commission which he saw, was general, directed to all his loving subjects, to raise and levy war against the prince of Orange and his adherents, and to seize all forts, castles, &amp;c. but that he neither saw, nor heard of any commission particularly levelled against the person of the prince of Orange. He owned, however, that he was privy to the design; but believed it was known to few or none but the immediate under∣takers. These two criminals were in their last moments attended, by Collier, Snatt, and Cook, three nonjuring clergymen, who absolved them in the view of the populace, with an imposition of hands: a public insult on the government which did not pass unnoticed. Those three clergymen were presented by the grand-jury, for having countenanced the treason by absolving the traitors, and thereby encouraged other persons to disturb the peace of the kingdom. An indictment being preferred against them, Cook and Snatt were committed to Newgate; but, Collier absconded, and published a vindication of their con∣duct, in which he affirmed, that the imposition of hands was the general practice
<PB N="153" REF="1560"/>
of the primitive church. On the other hand, the two metropolitans, and twelve other bishops, subscribed a declaration, condemning the administration of absolution without a previous confession made, and abhorrence expressed by the prisoners of the heinous crimes for which they suffered. In the course of the same month, Rookwood, Cranborne, and Lowick, were tried as conspira∣tors, by a special commission, in the king's bench; and convicted on the joint∣testimony of Porter, Harris, La Rue, Bertram, Fisher, and Pendergrass. Some favourable circumstances appeared in the case of Lowick. The proof of his having been concerned in the design against the king's life was very de∣fective: many persons of reputation declared, he was an honest good-natured, inoffensive man; and, he himself concluded his defence with the most solemn protestation of his own innocence. Great intercession was made for his pardon by some noblemen; but, all their interest proved ineffectual. Cranborne died in a transport of indignation, leaving a paper, which the government thought proper to suppress. Lowick and Rookwood likewise delivered declarations to the sheriff, the contents of which, as being less inflammatory, were allowed to be published. Both solemnly denied any knowledge of a commission from king James, to assassinate the prince of Orange: the one affirming, that he was incapable of granting such an order; and the other asserting, that he, the best of kings, had often rejected proposals of that nature. Lowick owned that he would have joined the king at his landing; but declared, he had never been concerned in any bloody affair during the whole course of his life. On the con∣trary, he said, he had endeavoured to prevent bloodshed as much as lay in his power; and that he would not kill the most miserable creature in the world, even though such an act would save his life, restore his sovereign, and make him one of the greatest men in England. Rookwood alledged, he was engaged by his immediate commander, whom he thought it was his duty to obey, though the service was much against his judgment and inclination. He professed his abhorrence of treachery even to an enemy. He forgave all mankind, even the prince of Orange, who, as a soldier, he said, ought to have considered his case before he signed his death-warrant: he prayed God would open his eyes, and render him sensible of the blood that was from all parts crying against him, so as he might avert a heavier execution than that which he now ordered to be inflicted. The next person brought to trial was Mr. Cooke, son of Sir Miles Cooke, one of the six clerks in chancery. Porter and Goodman deposed, that he had been present at two meetings in the King's-head-tavern in Leadenhall-street, with the lords Aylesbury and Montgomery, Sir William Perkins, Sir John Fenwick, Sir John Friend, Charnock, and Porter. The evidence of Goodman was invalidated by the testimony of the landlord and two drawers belonging to the tavern, who swore, that Goodman was not there while the noblemen were present. The prisoner himself solemnly protested that he was ever averse to the introduction of foreign forces: that he did not so much as hear of the intended invasion, until it became the common topic of conversation: and, that he had never seen Goodman at the King's-head. He declared his intention of receiving the blessed sacrament, and wished he might perish in the instant, if he now spoke untruth. No respect was payed to these asseverations. The sol∣licitor-general Hawles, and the lord chief-justice Treby, treated him with great severity in the prosecution and charge to the jury, by whom he was capitally
<PB N="154" REF="1570"/>
convicted. After his condemnation the court-agents tampered with him to make further discoveries; and after his fate had been protracted by divers short reprieves, he was sent into banishment. From the whole tenour of these dis∣coveries and proceedings, it appears, that James had actually meditated an in∣vasion: that his partisans in England had made preparations for joining him at his arrival: that a few desperadoes of that faction had concerted a scheme against the life of king William: that in prosecuting the conspirators the court had countenanced informers, the judges had strained the law, wrested circum∣stances, and even deviated from the function of their office, to convict the prison∣ers: in a word, that the administration had used the same arbitrary and unfair practices against those unhappy people, which they themselves had in the late reigns numbered among the grievances of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The warmth, however, manifested on this occasion, may have been owing to national resentment of the purposed invasion. Certain it is, the two houses of parliament, and the people in general, were animated with extraordinary indignation against France at this juncture. The lords besought his majesty, in a solemn address, to appoint a day of thanksgiving to almighty God, for having defeated the barbarous purpose of his enemies; and this was observed with uncommon zeal and devotion. Admiral Russel leaving a squa∣dron for observation on the French coast, returned to the Downs; but, Sir Cloudesley Shovel being properly prepared for the expedition, subjected Calais to another bombardment, by which the town was set on fire in different parts, and the inhabitants were overwhelmed with consternation. The generals of the allied army in Flanders resolved to make some immediate retaliation upon the French for their unmanly design upon the life of king William, as they took it for granted that Lewis was accessory to the scheme of assassination. That mo∣narch, on the supposition that a powerful diversion would be made by the de∣scent on England, had established a vast magazine at Givet, designing, when the allies should be enfeebled by the absence of the British troops, to strike some stroke of importance early in the campaign. On this the confederates now de∣termined to wreak their vengeance. In the beginning of March the earl of Ath∣lone and monsieur de Coehorn, with the concurrence of the duke of Holstein-Ploen, who commanded the allies, sent a strong detachment of horse, draughted from Brussels and the neighbouring garrisons, to amuse the enemy on the side of Charleroy; while they assembled forty squadrons, thirty battalions, with fifteen pieces of cannon, and six mortars, in the territory of Namur. Athlone with part of this body invested Dinant, while Coehorn with the remainder ad∣vanced to Givet. He forthwith began to batter and bombard the place, which in three hours was on fire, and by four in the afternoon wholly destroyed, with the great magazine it contained. Then the two generals joining their forces, returned to Namur without interruption. Hitherto the republic of Venice had deferred acknowleging king William; but now they sent an extraordinary em∣bassy for that purpose, consisting of signiors Soranzo and Venier, who arrived in London, and on the first day of May had a public audience. The king on this occasion knighted Soranzo as the senior ambassador, and presented him with the sword, according to custom. On that day too, William declared in council, that he had appointed the same regency which had governed the kingdom during his last absence; and embarking on the seventh at Margate, arrived at Orange-Polder
<PB N="155" REF="1580"/>
in the evening, under convoy of vice-admi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Aylmer, who had been ordered to attend with a squadron, as the famous Du Bart still continued at Dunkirk, and some attempt of importance was apprehended from his enter∣prising genius <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some promotions were made before the king left England. George Hamilton, third son of the duke of that name, was, for his military ser∣vices in Ireland and Flanders, created earl of Orkney. Sir John Lowther was ennobled, by the title of baron Lowther, and viscount Lonsdale; Sir John Thompson made baron of Haver∣sham, and the celebrated John Locke appointed one of the commissioners of the trade and plan∣tations.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The French had taken the field before the allied army could be assembled; but no transaction of consequence distinguished this campaign, either upon the Rhine or in Flanders. The scheme of Lewis was still defensive on the side of the Netherlands, while the active plans of king William were de∣feated by want of money. All the funds for this year proved defective; the land-bank failed, and the national bank sustained a rude shock in its credit. The loss of the nation upon the recoinage amounted to two millions, two hun∣dred thousand pounds: and though the different mints were employed without interruption, they could not for some months supply the circulation, especially as great part of the new money was kept up by those who received it in payment, or disposed of, at an unreasonable advantage. The French king having ex∣hausted the wealth and patience of his subjects, and greatly diminished their number in the course of this war, began to be diffident of his arms, and em∣ployed all the arts of private negotiation. While his minister D'Avauux pressed the king of Sweden to offer his medlation, he sent Callieres to Holland with proposals for settling the preliminaries of a treaty. He took it for granted, that as the Dutch were a trading people, whose commerce had greatly suffered in the war, they could not be averse to a pacification; and he instructed his emissaries to tamper with the malcontents of the republic, especially with the remains of the Louvestein faction, which had always opposed the schemes of the stadtholder. Callieres met with a favourable reception from the states, which began to treat with him about the preliminaries, though not without the consent and concurrence of king William and the rest of the allies. Lewis, with a view to quicken the effect of this negotiation, pursued offensive measures in Catalonia, where his general, the duke de Vendome attacked and worsted the Spaniards in their camp near Oftalric, tho' the action was not decisive; for he was obliged to retreat, after having made vigorous efforts against their intrench∣ments. On the twentieth day of June the marechal de Lorges passed the Rhine at Philipsburgh, and encamped within a league of Eppingen, where the Impe∣rial troops were obliged to intrench themselves, under the command of the prince of Baden, as they were not yet joined by the auxiliary forces. The French general, after having faced him about a month, thought proper to repass the river. Then he detached a body of horse to Flanders, and can∣toned the rest of his troops at Spires, Franckendal, Worms, and Ostofen. On the last day of August the prince of Baden retaliated the insult, by passing the Rhine at Mentz and Cocsheim. On the tenth he was joined by general Thungen, who commanded a separate body, together with the militia of Suabia and Franconia, and advanced to the camp of the enemy, who had reassembled, and were posted in such a manner, that he would not hazard an attack. Hav∣ing
<PB N="156" REF="1590"/>
therefore cannonaded them for some days, scoured the adjacent country by detached parties, and taken the little castle of Wiezengen, he repassed the river at Worms on the seventh day of October: the French likewise crossed at Philipsburgh, in hope of surprising general Thungen, who had taken post in the neighbourhood of Strasbourg; but, he retired to Eppingen before their arrival, and in a little time both armies were distributed in winter-quarters. Peter, the czar of Muscovy, carried on the siege of Azoph with such vigour, that the garrison was obliged to capitulate, after the Russians had defeated a great con∣voy sent to its relief. The court of Vienna forthwith engaged in an alliance with the Muscovite emperor; but, they did not exert themselves in taking advantage of the disaster which the Turks had undergone. The Imperial army, com∣manded by the elector of Saxony, continued inactive on the river Marosch till the nineteenth day of July, then they made a seint of attacking Temiswaer; but, they marched towards Betzkerch, in their route to Belgrade, on receiving advice that the grand signor intended to besiege Titul. On the twenty-first day of August the two armies were in sight of each other. The Turkish horse attacked the Imperialists in a plain near the river Begue; but were repulsed. The Germans next day made a show of retreating, in hope of drawing the ene∣my from their intrenchments. The stratagem succeeded. On the twenty-sixth the Turkish army was in motion; a detachment of the Imperialists attacked them in flank as they marched through a wood. A very desperate action en∣sued, in which the generals Heusler and Poland, with many other gallant officers, lost their lives. At length, the Ottoman horse were routed; but the Germans were so roughly handled, that on the second day after the engagement they retreated at midnight, and the Turks remained quiet in their intrench∣ments.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>In Piedmont the face of affairs underwent a strange alteration. The duke of Savoy, who had for some time been engaged in a secret negotia∣tion with France, at length embraced the offers of that crown, and privately signed a separate treaty of peace at Loretto, to which place he repaired on a pretended pilgrimage. The French king engaged to present him with four millions of livres, by way of reparation for the damage he had sustained; to assist him with a certain number of auxiliaries against all his enemies, and to effect a marriage between the duke of Burgundy and the princess of Piedmont, as soon as the parties should be marriageable. The treaty was guarantied by the pope and the Venetians, who were extremely desirous of seeing the Germans driven out of Italy. King William being apprized of this negotiation, com∣municated the intelligence to the earl of Galway, his ambassador at Turin, who expostulated with the duke upon his defection; but, he persisted in denying any such correspondence, until the advance of the French army enabled him to avow it, without fearing the resentment of the allies whom he had abandoned. Catinat marched into the plains of Turin, at the head of fifty thousand men; an army greatly superior to that of the confederates. Then he imparted to the ministers of the allies the proposals which France had made, represented the superior strength of her army, the danger to which he was exposed, and finally his inclination to embrace her offers. On the twelfth of July a truce was con∣cluded for a month, and afterwards prolonged till the fifteenth of September. He wrote to all the powers engaged in the confederacy, except king William,
<PB N="157" REF="1600"/>
expatiating on the same topics, and solliciting their consent. Tho' each in parti∣cular refused to concur, he on the twenty-third day of August signed the treaty in public, which he had before concluded in private. The emperor was no sooner informed of his design, than he took every step which he thought could divert him from his purpose. He sent the count Mansfeldt to Turin, with proposals for a match between the king of the Romans and the princess of Savoy, as well as with offers to augment his forces and his subsidy; but the duke had already settled his terms with France, from which he would not recede. Prince Eugene, though his kinsman, expressed great indignation at his conduct. The young prince de Commercy was so provoked at his defection, that he challenged him to single combat, and the duke accepted of his challenge; but, the quarrel was compromised by the intervention of friends, and they parted in an amicable manner. He had concealed the treaty until he should receive the remaining part of the subsidies due to him from the confederates. A considerable sum had been remitted from England to Genoa for his use; but, lord Galway no sooner received intimation of his new engagement, than he put a stop to the payment of this money, which he employed in the Milaneze for the subsistence of those troops that were in the British service. King William was encamped at Gem∣blours when the duke's envoy notified the separate peace which his master had concluded with the king of France. Though he was extremely chagrined at the information, he dissembled his anger, and listened to the minister without the least emotion. One of the conditions of this treaty was, That within a limited time the allies should evacuate the duke's dominions, otherwise they should be expelled by the joint-forces of France and Savoy. A neutrality was offered to the confederates; and, this being rejected, the contracting powers resolved to attack the Milaneze. Accordingly, when the truce expired, the duke, as gene∣ralissimo of the French king, entered that dutchy, and undertook the siege of Valentia; so that, in one campaign, he commanded two contending armies. The garrison of Valentia consisting of seven thousand men, Germans, Spaniards, and French protestants, made an obstinate defence; and the duke of Savoy pro∣secuted the siege with uncommon impetuosity. But, after the trenches had been open for thirteen days, a courier arrived from Madrid with an account of his catholic majesty's having agreed to the neutrality for Italy. This agreement imported, That there should be a suspension of arms until a general peace could be effected: and, That the Imperial and French troops should return to their respective countries. Christendom had well nigh been embroiled anew by the death of John Sobieski king of Poland, who died at the age of seventy, in the course of this summer, after having survived his faculties and reputation. As the crown was elective, a competition arose for the succession. The kingdom was divided by factions; and the different powers of Europe interested them∣selves warmly in the contention.</P>

<P>Nothing of consequence had been lately atchieved by the naval force of England. When the conspiracy was first discovered, Sir George Rooke had received orders to return from Cadiz; and he arrived in the latter end of April. While he took his place at the board of admiralty, lord Berkeley succeeded to the command of the fleet; and in the month of June set sail to∣wards Ushant, in order to insult the coast of France. He pillaged and burned the villages on the islands Grouais, Houat, and Heydic; made prize of about
<PB N="158" REF="1610"/>
twenty vessels; bombarded St. Martin's on the isle of Rhee, and the town of Olonne, which was set on fire in sisteen different places with the shells and car∣casses. Though these appear to have been enterprizes of small import, they certainly kept the whole coast of France in perpetual alarm. The ministry of that kingdom were so much afraid of invasion, that between Brest and Goulet they ordered above one hundred batteries to be erected; and above sixty thou∣sand men were continually in arms for the defence of the maritime places. In the month of May rear-admiral Benbow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed with a small squadron, in order to block up Du Bart in the harbour of Dunkirk; but, that famous adventurer found means to escape in a fog, and steering to the eastward, attacked the Dutch <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet in the Baltick, under a convoy of five frigates. These last he took, toge∣ther with half the number of the trading ships; but, falling in with the out∣ward-bound <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet, convoyed by thirteen ships of the line, he was obliged to burn four of the frigates, turn the fifth adrift, and part with all his prizes but fifteen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which he carried into Dunkirk.</P>

<P>The parliament of Scotland met on the eighth day of Sep∣tember; and lord Murray, secretary of state, now earl of Tullibardine, pre∣sided as king's commissioner. Though that kingdom was exhausted by the war, and two successive bad harvests, which had driven a great number of the inhabitants into Ireland, there was no opposition to the court-measures. The members of parliament signed an association like that of England. They granted a supply of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds for maintaining their forces by sea and land. They passed an act for securing their religion, lives, and properties, in case his majesty should come to an untimely death. By another, they obliged all persons in public trust to sign the association; and then the parliament was adjourned to the eighth day of December. The dis∣turbances of Ireland seemed now to be intirely appeased. Lord Capel dying in May, the council, by virtue of an act passed in the reign of Henry VIII. elected the chancellor Sir Charles Porter to be lord justice and chief go∣vernor of that kingdom, until his majesty's pleasure should be known. The parliament met in June: the commons expelled Mr. Sanderson, the only mem∣ber of that house who had refused to sign the association, and adjourned to the fourth day of August. By that time Sir Charles Porter, and the earls of Montrath and Drogheda, were appointed lords-justices, and signified the king's pleasure that they should adjourn. In the beginning of December the chancellor died of an apoplexy.</P>

<P>King William being tired of an inactive campaign, left the army under the command of the elector of Bavaria, and, about the lat∣ter end of Augu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, repaired to his palace at Loo, where he enjoyed his fa∣vourite exercise of stag-hunting. He visited the court of Brandenburg at Cleves; conferred with the states of Holland at the Hague; and, embarking for England, landed at Margate on the sixth day of October. The domestic oeconomy of the nation was extremely perplexed at this juncture, from the sinking of public credit, and the stagnation that necessarily attended a recoin∣age; grievances which were with diffi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lty removed by the clear apprehension, the enterprising genius, the unshake<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fortitude, of Mr. Montague, chancellor of the exchequer, operating upon a national spirit of adventure, which the monied-interest had produced. The king opened the session of parliament on the twentieth
<PB N="159" REF="1620"/>
day of October, with a speech, importing, That overtures had been made for a negotiation; but that the best way of treating with France would be sword in hand. He therefore desired they would be expeditious in raising the sup∣plies for the service of the ensuing year, as well as for making good the funds already granted. He declared, that the civil list could not be supported without their assistance. He recommended the miserable condition of the French protestants to their compassion. He desired they would contrive the best expedients for the recovery of the national credit; and observed, that unanimity and dispatch were now more than ever necessary for the honour, safety, and advantage of England. The commons having taken this speech into consideration, resolved, That they would support his majesty and his government, and assist him in the prosecution of the war: that the standard of gold and silver should not be altered: and, That they would make good all parliamentary funds. Then they presented an address, in a very spirited strain, declaring that, notwithstanding the blood and treasure of which the nation had been drained, the commons of England would not be diverted from their firm resolutions of obtaining by war a safe and honourable peace. They therefore renewed their assurances, that they would support his majesty against all his enemies at home and abroad. The house of lords delivered an∣other to the same purpose, declaring, that they would never be wanting or backward on their parts, in what might be necessary to his majesty's honour, the good of his kingdoms, and the quiet of Christendom. The commons, in the first transports of their zeal, ordered two seditious pamphlets to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. They deliberated upon the estimates, and granted above six millions for the service of the ensuing year. They re∣solved, that a supply should be granted for making good the deficiency of par∣liamentary funds; and appropriated several duties for this purpose.</P>

<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>With respect to the coin, they brought in a bill, repealing an act for taking off the obligation and encouragement of coining guineas for a certain time, and for importing and coining guineas and half-guineas, as the ex∣travagant price of those coins which occasioned this act, was now fallen. They passed a second bill for remedying the ill state of the coin; and a third, explain∣ing an act in the preceding session, for laying duties on low wines and spirits of the first extraction. In order to raise the supplies of the year, they resolved to tax all persons according to the true value of their real and personal estates, their stock upon land and in trade, their income by offices, pensions, and professions. A duty of one penny per week for one year, was layed upon all persons not re∣ceiving alms. A further imposition of one farthing in the pound per week, was fixed upon all servants receiving four pounds per annum, as wages, and up∣wards, to eight pounds a-year inclusive. Those who received from eight to sixteen pounds, were taxed at one half-penny per pound. An aid of three shillings in the pound for one year was layed upon all lands, tenements, and he∣reditaments, according to their true value. Without specifying the particulars of those impositions, we shall only observe, that in the general charge, the commons did not exempt one member of the commonwealth that could be sup∣posed able to bear any part of the burthen. Provision was made, that ham∣mered money should be received in payment of these duties, at the rate of five shillings and eight pence per ounce. All the deficiencies on annuities and mo∣nies
<PB N="160" REF="1630"/>
borrowed on the credit of the exchequer, were transferred to this aid. The treasury was enabled to borrow a million and half at eight per cent. and to circulate exchequer-bills to the amount of as much more. To cancel these debts, the surplus of all the supplies, except the three-shilling-aid, was appropriated. The commons voted one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds for making good the deficiency in recoining the hammered money, and the recompence for bringing in plate to the mint. This sum was raised by a tax or duty upon wrought-plate, paper, pasteboard, velum, and parchment, made or imported. Taking into consideration the services, and the present languishing state of the bank, whose notes were at twenty per cent. discount, they resolved, That it should be enlarged by new subscriptions, made by four-fifths in tallies struck on parlia∣mentary funds, and one-fifth in bank-bills or notes: That effectual provision should be made by parliament, for paying the principal of all such tallies as should be subscribed into the bank, out of the funds agreed to be continued: That an interest of eight per cent. should be allowed on all such tallies: and, That the continuance of the bank should be prolonged to the first day of Au∣gust, in the year one thousand seven hundred and ten: That all assignments of orders on tallies subscribed into the bank, should be registered in the exchequer: That, before the day should be fixed for the beginning of the new subscriptions, the old should be made one hundred per cent. and what might exceed that va∣lue should be divided among the old members: That all the interest due on those tallies which might be subscribed into the bank-stock, at the time appointed for subscriptions, to the end of the last preceding quarter on each tally, should be allowed as principal: That liberty should be given by parliament to enlarge the number of bank-bills, to the value of the sum that should be so subscribed, over and above the twelve hundred thousand pounds; provided they should be obliged to answer such bills and demands, and in default thereof, be answered by the exchequer out of the first money due to them: That no other bank should be erected or allowed by act of parliament, during the continuance of the bank of England: That this should be exempted from all tax or imposition: That no act of the corporation should forfeit the particular interest of any person concerned therein: That provision should be made to prevent the officers of the exche∣quer, and all other officers and receivers of the revenue, from diverting, delay∣ing, or obstructing the course of payments to the bank: That care should be taken to prevent the altering, counterfeiting, or forging any bank-bills or notes: That the estate and interest of each member in the stock of the corporation should be made a personal estate: That no contract made for any bank-stock to be bought or sold, should be valued in law or equity, unless actually registered in the bank-books within seven days, and actually transferred within fourteen days after the contract should be made. A bill upon these resolutions was brought in, under the direction of the chancellor of the exchequer: it related to the continuation of tonnage and poundage, upon wine, vinegar, and tobacco: and it comprehended a clause for laying an additional duty upon salt, for two years and three quarters. All the several branches constituted a general fund, since known by the name of the General mortgage, without prejudice to their former appro∣priations. The bill also provided, That the tallies should bear eight per cent. inter∣est: That from the tenth of June for five years, they should bear no more than six per cent. interest: and, That no premium or discount upon them should be
<PB N="161" REF="1640"/>
taken. In case of the general fund's proving insufficient to pay the whole in∣terest, it was provided, That every proprietor should receive his proportion of the product, and the deficiency be made good from the next aid; but, should the fund produce more than the interest, the surplus was destined to operate as a sinking fund for the discharge of the principal. In order to make up a deficiency of above eight hundred thousand pounds, occasioned by the failure of the land-bank, additional duties were layed upon leather: the time was en∣larged for persons to come in and purchase the annuities payable by several for∣mer acts, and to obtain more certain interest in such annuities.</P>

<P>Never were more vigorous measures taken to support the credit of the government; and never was the government served by such a set of en∣terprising undertakers. The commons having received a message from the king touching the condition of the civil list, resolved, That a sum not exceed∣ing five hundred and fifteen thousand pounds should be granted for the support of the civil list for the ensuing year, to be raised by a malt tax and additional duties upon mum, sweets, cyder, and perry. They likewise resolved, That an additional aid of one shilling in the pound should be layed on land, as an equi∣valent for the duty of ten per cent. upon mixed goods. Provision was made for raising one million four hundred thousand pounds by a lottery. The trea∣sury was impowered to issue an additional number of exchequer-bills to the amount of twelve hundred thousand pounds, every hundred pounds bearing interest at the rate of five pence a day, and ten per cent. for circulation; and finally, in order to liquidate the transport-debt, which the funds established for that purpose had not been sufficient to defray, a money-bill was brought in to oblige pedlars and hawkers to take out licences, and pay for them at certain stated prices. One cannot without astonishment reflect upon the prodigious efforts that were made upon this occasion, or consider without indignation the enormous fortunes that were raised up by usurers and extortioners from these distresses of their country. The nation did not seem to know its own strength, until it was put to this extraordinary trial; and the experiment of mortgaging funds succeeded so well, that later ministers have proceeded in the same system, imposing burthen upon burthen, as if they thought the sinews of the nation could never be overstrained.</P>

<P>The public credit being thus bolstered up by the singular address of Mr. Montague, and the bills passed for the supplies of the ensuing year, the attention of the commons was transferred to the case of Sir John Fenwick, who had been apprehended in the month of June at New-Romney, in his way to France. He had, when taken, written a letter to his lady by one Webber, who accompanied him; but, this man being seized, the letter was found, containing such a confession as plainly evinced him guilty. He then entered into a treaty with the court for turning evidence, and delivered a long information in writing, which was sent abroad to his majesty. He made no discoveries that could injure any of the Jacobites, who, by his account and other concurring testimonies, ap∣peared to be divided into two parties, known by the names of Compounders and Noncompounders. The first, headed by the earl of Middleton, insisted upon receiving security from king James, that the religion and liberties of England should be preserved: whereas, the other party, at the head of which was the earl of Melfort, resolved to bring him in without conditions, relying upon his
<PB N="162" REF="1650"/>
own honour and generosity. King William having sent over an order for bringing Fenwick to trial, unless he should make more material discoveries, the prisoner, with a view to amuse the ministry, until he could take other measures for his own safety, accused the earls of Shrewsbury, Marlborough, and Bath, the lord Godolphin, and admiral Russel, of having made their peace with king James, and engaged to act for his interest. Mean while his lady and relations tampered with the two witnesses, Porter and Goodman. The first of these dis∣covered those practices to the government; and one Clancey, who acted as agent for lady Fenwick, was tried, convicted of subornation, fined, and set in the pillory; but, they had succeeded better in their attempts upon Goodman, who disappeared: so that one witness only remained, and Fenwick began to think his life was out of danger. Admiral Russel acquainted the house of commons, that he and several persons of quality had been reflected upon in some informa∣tions of Sir John Fenwick; he therefore desired, that he might have an oppor∣tunity to justify his own character. Mr. secretary Trumball produced the pa∣pers, which having been read, the commons ordered. That Sir John Fenwick should be brought to the bar of the house. There he was exhorted by the speaker to make an ample discovery; which, however, he declined, without having first received some security that what he might say should not prejudice himself. He was ordered to withdraw, until they should have deliberated on his request. Then he was called in again, and the keeper told him, he might deserve the favour of the house by making a full discovery. He desired he might be in∣dulged with a little time to recollect himself, and promised to obey the com∣mand of the house. This favour being denied, he again insisted upon having security; which they refusing to grant, he chose to be silent, and was dismissed from the bar. The house voted, That his informations reflecting upon the fidelity of several noblemen, members of the house, and others, upon hearsay, were false and scandalous, contrived to undermine the government, and create jealousies between the king and his subjects, in order to stifle the conspiracy.</P>

<DIV4 N="42" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>A motion being made, for leave to bring in a bill to attaint him of high-treason, a warm debate ensued, and the question being put, was carried in the affirmative by a great majority. He was furnished with a copy of the bill, and al∣lowed the use of pen, ink, paper, and counsel. When he presented a petition, pray∣ing, that his counsel might be heard against passing the bill, they made an order, that his counsel should be allowed to make his defence at the bar of the house: so that he was surprised into an irregular trial, instead of being indulged with an opportunity of offering objections to their passing the bill of attainder. He was accordingly brought to the bar of the house; and the bill being read in his hearing, the speaker called upon the king's counsel to open the evidence. The prisoner's counsel objected to their proceeding to trial, alledging, that their client had not received the least notice of their purpose, and therefore could not be prepared for his defence; but, that they came to offer their reasons against the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. The house, after a long debate resolved, That he should be al∣lowed further time to produce witnesses in his defence: that the counsel for the king should likewise be allowed to produce evidence to prove the treasons of which he stood indicted: and, an order was made for his being brought to the bar again in three days. In pursuance of this order he appeared, when the in∣dictment which had been found against him by the grand jury, was produced;
<PB N="163" REF="1660"/>
and Porter was examined as evidence. Then the record of Clancey's convic∣tion was read; and one Roe testified, that Dighton, the prisoner's sollicitor, had offered him an annuity of one hundred pounds, to discredit the testimony of Goodman. The king's counsel moved, that Goodman's examination, as taken by Mr. Vernon, clerk of the council, might be read. Sir J. Powis and Sir Bartholemew Shower, the prisoner's counsel, warmly opposed this proposal; they affirmed, that a deposition taken when the party affected by it was not present to cross-examine the deposer, could not be admitted in a case of five shil∣lings value: that though the house was not bound by the rules of inferior courts, it was nevertheless bound by the eternal and unalterable rules of justice: that no evidence, according to the rules of law, could be admitted in such a case, but that of living witnesses: and, that the examination of a person who is absent, was never read to supply his testimony. The dispute between the lawyers on this subject, gave rise to a very violent debate among the members of the house. Sir Edward Seymour, Sir Richard Temple, Mr. Harley, Mr. Harcourt, Mr. Manley, Sir Christopher Musgrave, and all the leaders of the Tory-party, ar∣gued against the hardship and injustice of admitting this information as an evi∣dence. They demonstrated, that it would be a step contrary to the practice of all courts of judicature, repugnant to the common notions of justice and huma∣nity, diametrically opposite to the last act for regulating trials in cases of high∣treason, and of dangerous consequences to the lives and liberties of the people. On the other hand, lord Cutts, Sir Thomas Littleton, Mr. Montague, Mr. Smith of the treasury, and Trevor the attorney-general, affirmed, that the house was not bound by any form of law whatsoever: that this was an extraordinary case, in which the safety of the government was deeply concerned: that tho' the common law might require two evidences in cases of treason, the house had a power of deviating from those rules in extraordinary cases: that there was no reason to doubt of Sir John Fenwick's being concerned in the conspi∣racy: that he or his friends had tampered with Porter: and, that there were strong presumptions to believe, the same practices had induced Goodman to abscond. In a word, the Tories, either from party or patriotism, strenuously asserted the cause of liberty and humanity, by those very arguments which had been used against them in the former reigns; while the Whigs, with equal vio∣lence and more success, espoused the dictates of arbitrary power and oppression, in the face of their former principles, with which they were now upbraided. At length, the question was put, Whether or not the information of Goodman should be read? and was carried in the affirmative by a majority of seventy-three voices. Then two of the grand-jury who had found the indictment, recited the evidence which had been given to them by Porter and Goodman; lastly, the king's counsel insisted upon producing the record of Cooke's conviction, as he had been tried for the same conspiracy. The prisoner's counsel objected, That if such evidence was admitted, the trial of one person in the same company would be the trial of all; and, it could not be expected that they who came to defend Sir John Fenwick only, should be prepared to answer the charge against Cooke. This article produced another vehement debate among the members; and the Whigs obtained a second victory. The record was read, and the king's counsel proceeded to call on some of the jury who served on Cooke's trial, to affirm, that he had been convicted on Goodman's evidence. Sir Bartholomew Shower said,
<PB N="164" REF="1670"/>
he would submit it to the consideration of the house, Whether it was just that the evidence against one person should conclude against another standing at a different bar, in defence of his life? The parties were again ordered to with∣draw; and from this point arose a third debate, which ended as the two former, to the disadvantage of the prisoner. The jury being examined, Mr. serjeant Gould moved, that Mr. Vernon might be desired to produce the intercepted letter from Sir John Fenwick to his lady. The prisoner's counsel warmly op∣posed this motion, insisting upon their proving it to be his hand-writing before it could be used against him; and no further stress was layed on this evidence. When they were called upon to enter on his defence, they pleaded incapacity to deliver matters of such importance after they had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>atigued with twelve hours attendance.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>The house resolved to hear such evidence as the prisoner had to produce that night. His counsel declared, that they had nothing then to pro∣duce but the copy of a record; and the second resolution was, That he should be brought up again next day at noon. He accordingly appeared at the bar, and Sir J. Powis proceeded on his defence. He observed, that the bill under consideration affected the lives of the subjects; and such precedents were dan∣gerous: that Sir John Fenwick was forthcoming, in order to be tried by the ordinary methods of justice: that he was actually under process, had pleaded, and was ready to stand trial: that if there was sufficient clear evidence against him, as the king's serjeant had declared, there was no reason for his being de∣prived of the benefit of such a trial as was the birth-right of every British sub∣ject; and if there was a deficiency of legal evidence, he thought this was a very odd reason for the bill. He took notice that even the regicides had the benefit of such a trial: that the last act for regulating trials in cases of treason, proved the great tenderness of the laws which affected the life of the subject: and he expressed his surprize that the very parliament which had passed that law, should enact another for putting a person to death without any trial at all. He admitted that there had been many bills of attainder, but they were gene∣rally levelled at outlaws and fugitives; and some of them had been reversed in the sequel, as arbitrary and unjust. He urged, that this bill of attainder did not alledge or say, that Sir John Fenwick was guilty of the treason for which he ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cted; a circumstance which prevented him from producing wit∣nesses to that and several matters upon which the king's counsel had expatiated. He said, they had introduced evidence to prove circumstances not aliedged in the bill, and defective evidence of those that were: that Porter was not exa∣mined upon oath: that nothing could be more severe than to pass sentence of death <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon a man, corrupt his blood, and confiscate his estate, upon parole evi∣dence; especially of such a wretch, who, by his own confession, had been en∣gaged in a crime of the blackest nature, not a convert to the dictates of consci∣ence, but a coward, shrinking from the danger by which he had been environed, and even now drudging for a pardon. He invalidated the evidence of Goodman's examination. He observed, that the indictment mentioned a conspiracy to call in a foreign power; but, as this conspiracy had not been put in practice, such an agreement was not a sufficient over-act of treason, according to the opinion of Hawles the sollicitor-general, concerned in this very prosecution. So saying, he produced a book of remarks, which that lawyer had published on the cases
<PB N="165" REF="1680"/>
of lord Russel, colonel Sidney, and others who had suffered death in the reign of Charles. This author (said he) takes notice, that a conspiracy or agreement to levy war, is not treason without actually levying war; a sentiment in which he concurred with lord Coke, and lord chief-justice Hales: he concluded with say∣ing, <Q>“We know at present on what ground we stand; by the statute of Edward III. we know what treason is; by the two statutes of Edward VI. and the late act, we know what is proof; by the magna charta we know we are to be tried per legem terrae &amp; per judicium parium, by the law of the land and the judgment of our peers; but, if bills of attainder come into fashion, we shall neither know what is treason, what is evidence, nor how, nor where we are to be tried.”</Q> He was seconded by Sir Bartholomew Shower, who spoke with equal energy and elocution; and their arguments were answered by the king's counsel. The prisoner was afterwards, at the desire of admiral Russel, questioned with regard to the imputations he had fixed upon that gentleman and others, from hearsay; but, he desired to be excused on account of the risque he ran while under a double prosecution, if any thing which should escape him might be turned to his prejudice.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLIV.</HEAD>
<P>After he was removed from the bar, Mr. Vernon, at the desire of the house, recapitulated the arts and practices of Sir John Fenwick and his friends, to procrastinate the trial. The bill was read a second time; and the speaker asking, If the question should be put for its being committed? the house was immediately kindled into a new flame of contention. Hawles the sollicitor, affirmed, that the house in the present case, should act both as judge and jury. Mr. Harcourt said, he knew of no trial for treason but what was confirmed by magna charta, by a jury, the birthright and darling privilege of an English∣man, or per legem terrae, which includes impeachments in parliament: that it was a strange trial where the person accused had a chance to be hanged, but none to be saved: that he never heard of a juryman who was not on his oath, nor of a judge who had not power to examine witnesses upon oath, and who was not impowered to save the innocent as well as to condemn the guilty. Sir Thomas Lyttleton was of opinion, that the parliament ought not to stand upon little niceties and forms of other courts, when the government was at stake. Mr. Howe asserted, that to do a thing of this nature, because the parliament had power to do it, was a strange way of reasoning: that what was justice and equity at Westminster-hall, was justice and equity every where: that one bad precedent in parliament was of worse consequence than an hundred in West∣minster-hall, because personal or private injuries did not foreclose the claims of original right; whereas the parliament could ruin the nation beyond redemp∣tion, because it could establish tyranny by law. Sir Richard Temple, in arguing against the bill, observed, that the power of parliament is to make any law, but the jurisdiction of parliament is to govern itself by the law: to make a law therefore against all the laws of England was the ultimum remedium &amp; pessimum, never to be used but in case of absolute necessity. He affirmed, that by this prece∣dent the house overthrew all the laws of England; first, in condemning a man upon one witness; secondly, in passing an act without any trial. The commons never did nor can assume a jurisdiction of trying any person; they may, for their own information, hear what can be offered; but, it is not a trial where witnesses are not upon oath. All bills of attainder have passed against persons that were
<PB N="166" REF="1690"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or fled, or without the compass of the law: some have been brought in after trials in Westminster-hall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but none of those have been called trials, and they were generally revers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. He denied that the parliament had power to de∣clare any thing trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n which was not treason before. When inferior courts were dubious, the case might be brought before the parliament, to judge whether it was treason or felony: but, then they must judge by the laws in being; and this judgment was not in the parliament by bill, but, only in the house of lords. Lord Digby, Mr. Harley, and colonel Granville, spoke to the same purpose. But their arguments and remonstrances had no effect upon the majority, by whom the prisoner was devoted to destruction. The bill was committed, passed, and sent up to the house of lords, where it produced the longest and warmest de∣bates which had been known since the restoration. Bishop Burnet signalized his zeal for the government<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by a long speech in favour of the bill, contradict∣ing some of the fundamental maxims which he had formerly avowed in behalf of the liberties of the people. At length, it was carried by a majority of seven voices; and one and forty lords, including eight prelates, entered a protest couched in the strongest terms, against the decision.</P>

<DIV4 N="45" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLV.</HEAD>
<P>When the bill received the royal assent, another act of the like na∣ture passed against Barclay, Holmes, and nine other conspirators who had fled from justice, in case thay should not surrender themselves on or before the twenty-fifth day of March next ensuing. Sir John Fenwick sollicited the me∣diation of the lords in his behalf, while his friends implored the royal mercy. The peers gave him to understand, that the success of his suit would depend upon the fullness of his discoveries. He would have previously stipulated for a pardon; and they insisted upon his depending on their favour. He hesitated some time between the fears of infamy and the terrors of death, which last he at length chose to undergo, rather than incur the disgraceful character of an informer. He was complimented with the ax, in consideration of his rank and alliance with the house of Howard, and suffered on Tower-hill with great com∣posure. In the paper which he delivered to the sheriff, he took God to witness, that he knew not of the intended invasion, until it was the common subject of discourse; nor was he engaged in any shape for the service of king James. He thanked those noble and worthy persons who had opposed his attainder in parliament; prote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d before God, that the information he gave to the ministry, he had received in letters and messages from France; and observed, that he might have expected mercy from the prince of Orange, as he had been instru∣mental in saving his life, by preventing the execution of a design which had been formed against it; a circumstance which in all probability induced the late conspirators to conceal their purpose of assassination from his knowledge. He professed his loyalty to king James, and prayed heaven for his speedy re∣storation.</P>

<P>While Fenwick's affair was in agitation, the earl of Monmouth had set on foot some practices against the duke of Shrewsbury. One Matthew Smith, nephew to Sir William Perkins, had been entertained as a spy by this nobleman, who finding his intelligence of very little use or importance, dis∣missed him as a troublesome dependant. Then he had recourse to the earl of Monmouth, into whom he infused unfavourable sentiments of the duke; insi∣nuating, that he had made great discoveries, which, from sinister motives were
<PB N="167" REF="1700"/>
suppressed. Monmouth communicated those impressions to the earl of Port∣land, who inlisted Smith as one of his intelligencers. Copies of the letters he had sent to the duke of Shrewsbury were delivered to secretary Trumball, sealed up for the perusal of his majesty at his return from Flanders. When Fenwick mentioned the duke of Shrewsbury in his discoveries, the earl of Mon∣mouth resolved to seize the opportunity of ruining that nobleman. He, by the canal of the dutchess of Norfolk, exhorted lady Fenwick to prevail upon her husband to persist in his accusation, and even dictated a paper of directions. Fenwick rejected the proposal with disdain, as a scandalous contrivance; and Monmouth was so incensed at his refusal, that when the bill of attainder ap∣peared in the house of lords, he spoke in favour of it with peculiar vehemence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lady Fenwick, provoked at this cruel outrage, prevailed upon her nephew the earl of Carlisle, to move the house, that Sir John might be examined touching any advices that had been sent to him with relation to his discoveries. He gave an account of all the particulars of Monmouth's scheme, which was calculated to ruin the duke of Shrewsbury, by bringing Smith's letters on the carpet. The dutchess of Norfolk and a confident were interrogated, and con∣firmed the detection. The house called for Smith's letters, which were pro∣duced by Sir William Trumball. The earl of Monmouth was committed to the Tower, and dismissed from all his employments. He was released, how∣ever, at the end of the session; and the court made up all his losses in private, lest he should be tempted to join the opposition.</P>

<P>The Whigs, before they were glutted with the sacrifice of Fen∣wick, had determined to let loose their vengeance upon Sir George Rooke, who was a leader in the opposite interest. Sir Cloudesley Shovel had been sent with a squadron to look into Brest, where, according to the intelligence which the government had received, the French were employed in preparing for a descent upon England; but this information was false. They were busy in equipping an armament for the West-Indies, under the command of Mr. Pointis, who actually sailed to the coast of New-Spain, and took the city of Carthagene. Rooke had been ordered to intercept the Toulon squadron in its way to Brest; but his endeavours miscarried. The commons, in a committee of the whole house, resolved to inquire why this fleet was not intercepted? Rooke under∣went a long examination, and was obliged to produce his journal, orders, and letters. Shovel and Mitchel were likewise examined; but, nothing appearing to the prejudice of the admiral, the house thought proper to desist from their prosecution. After they had determined on the fate of Fenwick, they proceeded to enact several laws for regulating the domestic oeconomy of the nation; and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Oldmixon. State Trials. Tindal. Ralph. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> among others, passed an act for the more effectual relief of creditors in cases of es∣cape, and for preventing abuses in prisons and pretended privileged places. Ever since the reformation, certain places in and about the city of London, which had been sanctuaries during the prevalence of the popish religion, afforded asylum to debtors, and were become receptacles of desperate persons, who pre∣sumed to set the law at defiance. One of these places, called White-Fryers, was filled with a crew of russians, who every day committed acts of violence and outrage; but, this law was so vigorously put in execution, that they were ob∣liged to abandon the district, which was soon filled with more creditable inhabi∣tants. On the sixteenth day of April the king closed the session with a short
<PB N="168" REF="1710"/>
<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1697.</NOTE> speech, thanking the parliament for the great supplies they had so chearfully granted; and expressing his satisfaction at the measures they had taken for re∣trieving the public credit. Before he quitted the kingdom, he ventured to pro∣duce upon the scene the earl of Sunderland, who had hitherto prompted his coun∣cils behind the curtain. He was now sworn of the privy-council, and gratified with the office of lord-chamberlain, which had been resigned by the earl of Dorset, a nobleman of elegant talents, and invincible indolence, severe and poignant in his writings and remarks upon mankind in general, but humane, good-na∣tured, and generous to excess, in his commerce with individuals.</P>

<P>William having made some promotions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Somers was created a baron, and appointed lord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chancellor of England: admiral Russel was dignified with the title of earl of O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ford. In Fe∣bruary the earl of Aylesbury, who had been com∣mitted on account of the conspiracy, was released upon bail; but, this privilege was denied to lord Montgomery, who had been imprisoned in Newgate on the same account.</NOTE>, and appointed a re∣gency, embarked on the twenty sixth day of April for Holland, that he might be at hand to manage the negotiation for a general peace. By this time the preliminaries were settled, between Callieres the French minister, and Mr. Dyk∣veldt in behalf of the states general, who resolved, in consequence of the con∣cessions made by France, that, in concert with their allies, the mediation of Sweden might be accepted. The emperor and the court of Spain, however, were not satisfied with those concessions; yet, his Imperial majesty declared, he would embrace the proffered mediation, provided the treaty of Westphalia should be re-established; and the king of Sweden would engage to join his troops with those of the allies, in case France should break through this stipu∣lation. This proposal being delivered, the ministers of England and Holland at Vienna, presented a joint-memorial, pressing his Imperial majesty to accept the mediation without reserve, and name a place at which the congress might be opened. The emperor complied with reluctance. On the fourteenth day of February, all the ministers of the allies, except the ambassador of Spain, agreed to the proposal; and next day signified their assent in form to Mr. Lillieroot the Swedish plenipotentiary. Spain demanded, as a preliminary, that France would agree to restore all the places mentioned in a long list, which the minister of that crown presented to the assembly. The emperor proposed, that the congress should be held at Aix-la-Chapelle, or Franckfort, or some other town in Ger∣many. The other allies were more disposed to negotiate in Holland. At length, the French king suggested, that no place would be more proper than a palace belonging to king William, called Newbourg-house, situated between the Hague and Delft, close by the village of Ryswick; and to this proposition the ministers agreed. Those of England were, the earl of Pembroke, a virtuous, learned, and popular nobleman, the lord Villiers, and Sir Joseph Williamson; and France sent Harlay and Crecy to the assistance of Callieres. Lewis was not only tired of the war, on account of the misery in which it had involved his kingdom; but, in desiring a peace he was actuated by another motive. The king of Spain had been for some time in a very ill state of health, and the French monarch had an eye to the succession. This aim could not be accom∣plished while the confederacy subsisted; therefore he eagerly sought a peace, that he might at once turn his whole power against Spain, as soon as Charles should expire. The emperor harboured the same design upon the Spanish
<PB N="169" REF="1720"/>
crown, and for that reason interested himself in the continuance of the grand alliance. Besides, he foresaw he should in a little time be able to act against France with an augmented force. The czar of Muscovy had engaged to find employment for the Turks and Tartars. He intended to raise the elector of Saxony to the throne of Poland; and he had made some progress in a negotiation with the Circles of the Rhine, for a considerable body of auxiliary troops. The Dutch had no other view but that of securing a barrier in the Netherlands. King William insisted upon the French king's acknowledging his title; and the English nation wished for nothing so much as the end of a ruinous war. On the tenth day of February, Callieres, in the name of his master, agreed to the following preliminaries: That the treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen should be the basis of this negotiation: That Strasburg should be restored to the Empire, and Luxemburg to the Spaniards, together with Mons, Charleroy, and all places taken by the French in Catalonia since the treaty of Nimeguen: That Dinant should be ceded to the bishop of Liege, and all reuni∣ons since the treaty of Nim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guen, be made void: That the French king should make restitution of Lorraine; and, upon conclusion of the peace, acknowledge the prince of Orange as king of Great-Britain, without condition or reserve. The conferences were interrupted by the death of Charles XI. king of Sweden, who was succeeded by his son Charles, then a minor; but, the queen and five senators, whom the late king had by will appointed administrators of the go∣vernment, resolved to pursue the mediation, and sent a new commission to Lillienroot for that purpose. The ceremonials being regulated with the consent of all parties, the plenipotentiaries of the emperor delivered their master's de∣mands to the mediator, on the twenty-second day of May, and several German ministers gave in the pretensions of the respective princes whom they re∣presented.</P>

<P>Mean while, the French king, in the hope of procuring more favourable terms, resolved to make his last effort against the Spaniards in Ca∣talonia and in the Netherlands, and to elevate the prince of Conti to the throne of Poland; an event which would greatly improve the interest of France in Europe. Lewis had got the start of the confederates in Flanders, and sent thither a very numerous army, commanded by Catinat, Villeroy, and Boufflers. The campaign was opened with the siege of Aeth, which was no sooner invested, than king William having recovered of an indisposition, took the field, and had an interview with the duke of Bavaria, who commanded a separate body. He did not think proper to interrupt the enemy in their operations before Aeth, which surrendered in a few days after the trenches were opened; but, contented himself with taking possession of an advantageous camp, where he covered Brussels, which Villeroy and Boufflers had determined to besiege. In Catalonia the duke of Vendome invested Barcelona, in which there was a garrison of ten thousand regular soldiers, besides five thousand burghers, who had voluntarily taken arms on this occasion. The governor of the place was the prince of Hesse d'Armstadt, who had served in Ireland, and been vested with the command of the Imperial troops which were sent into Spain. The French general being rein∣forced from Provence and Languedoc, carried on his approaches with surprising impetuosity; and was repulsed in several attacks by the valour of the defendants. At length, the enemy surprised and routed the viceroy of Catalonia; and, flushed
<PB N="170" REF="1730"/>
with this victory, stormed the outworks, which had been long battered with their cannon. The dispute was very bloody and obstinate; but, the French by dint of numbers made themselves masters of the covered-way and two bastions. There they erected batteries of cannon and mortars, and fired furiously on the town, which, however, the prince of Hesse resolved to defend to the last extremity. The court of Madrid, however, unwilling to see the place intirely ruined, as in all probability it would be restored at the peace, dispatched an order to the prince to capitulate; and he obtained very honourable terms, after having made a glorious defence for nine weeks; in consideration of which he was appointed viceroy of the province. France was no sooner in possession of this important place, than the Spaniards became as eager for peace as they had been averse to a negotiation.</P>

<P>Their impatience was not a little inflamed by the success of Pointis in America, where he took Carthagene, in which he found a booty amounting to eight millions of crowns. Having ruined the fortifications of the place, and received advice, that an English squadron under admiral Nevil had arrived in the West-Indies, with a design to attack him in his return, he bore away for the straights of Bahama. On the twenty-second day of May he fell in with the English fleet, and one of his fly-boats was taken; but, such was his dexterity, or good fortune, that he escaped, after having been pursued five days, during which the English and Dutch rear-admirals sprang their foretopmasts, and re∣ceived other damage, so as that they could not proceed. Then Nevil steered to Carthagene, which he found quite abandoned by the inhabitants, who, after the departure of Pointis, had been rifled a second time by the buccaneers, on pretence that they had been defrauded of their share of the plunder. This was really the case: they had in a great measure contributed to the success of Pointis, and were very ill rewarded. In a few days the English admiral discovered eight sail of their ships, two of which were forced on shore and destroyed, two taken, and the rest escaped. Then he directed his course to Jamaica, and, by the advice of the governor, Sir William Beeston, detached rear-admiral Meeze with some ships and forces to attack Petit-Guavas, which he accordingly surprised, burned, and reduced to ashes. After this small expedition Nevil proceeded to the Ha∣vannah, on purpose to take the galleons under his convoy for Europe, according to the instructions he had received from the king; but, the governor of the place, and the general of the plate-fleet, suspecting such an offer, would neither suffer him to enter the harbour, nor put the galleons under his protection. He now sailed through the gulph of Florida to Virginia, where he died of chagrin; and the command of the fleet devolved to captain Dilkes, who arrived in Eng∣land on the twenty fourth day of October, with a shattered squadron half-manned, to the unspeakable mortification of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he people, who flattered them∣selves with the hopes of wealth and glory from this expedition. Pointis steering to the banks of Newfoundland, entered the bay of Conception, at a time when a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tout English squadron commanded by commodore Norris lay at anchor in the bay of St. John's. This officer being informed of the arrival of a French fleet, at first concluded, that it was the squadron of Mr. Nesmond come to attack them, and exerted his utmost endeavours to put the place in a posture of de∣fence; but, afterwards understanding, that it was Pointis returning with the spoil of Carthagene, he called a council of war, and proposed to go immediately
<PB N="171" REF="1740"/>
in quest of the enemy. He was, howeven, over-ruled by a majority, who gave it as their opinion, that they should remain where they were, without run∣ning unnecessary hazards. By virtue of this scandalous determination, Pomels was permitted to proceed on his voyage to Europe; but, he had not yet escaped every danger. On the fourteenth day of August he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell in with a squadron under the command of captain Harlow, by whom he was boldly engaged till night parted the combatants. He was pursued next day; but his ships <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailing better than those of Harlow, he accomplished his escape, and on the morrow entered the harbour of Brest. That his ships which were foul should outfail the English squadron which had just put to sea, was a mystery which the people of England could not explain. They complained of having been betrayed through the whole course of the West-Indian expedition. The king owned he did not understand marine affairs, the intire conduct of which he abandoned to Russel, who became proud, arbitrary, and unpopular<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and was supposed to be be∣trayed by his dependants. Certain it is, the service was greatly ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tructed by faction among the officers, which with respect to the nation had all the effects of treachery and misconduct.</P>

<P>The success of the French in Catalonia, Flanders, and the West-Indies, was ballanced by their disappointment in Poland. Lewis, encouraged by the remonstrances of the abbé de Polignac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who managed the affairs of France in that kingdom, resolved to support the prince of Conti as a candidate for the crown, and remitted great sums of money, which were distributed among the Polish nobility. The emperor had at first declared for the son of the late king; but, finding the French party too strong for this competitor, he entered into a negotiation with the elector of Saxony, who agreed to change his religion, to distribute eight millions of florins among the Poles, to confirm then privileges, and advance with his troops to the frontiers of that kingdom. Then he declared himself a candidate, and was publicly espoused by the Imperialists. The duke of Lorrain, the prince of Baden<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Don Livio Odeschalchi, nephew to pope Innocent, were likewise competitors; but, finding their interest insuffi∣cient, they united their influence with that of the elector, who was proclaimed king of Poland. He forthwith took the oaths required, procured an attestation from the Imperial court of his having changed his religion, and marched with his army to Cracow, where he was crowned with the usual solemnity. Lewis persisted in maintaining the pretensions of the prince of Conti, and equipped a fleet at Dunkirk for his convoy to Dantzick in his way to Poland. But the magis∣trates of that city, who had declared for the new king, would not suffer his men to land, though they offered to admit himself with a small retinue. He there∣fore went on shore at Marienburg, where he was met by some chiefs of his own party; but, the new king Augustus acted with such vigilance, that he found it impracticable to form an army: besides, he suspected the fidelity of his own Polish partisans; he therefore refused to part with the treasure he had brought, and in the beginning of winter returned to Dunkirk.</P>

<P>The establishment of Augustus on the throne of Poland was in some measure owing to the conduct of Peter the czar of Muscovy, who having formed great designs against the Ottoman-Porte, was very unwilling to see the crown of Poland possessed by a partisan of France, which was in alliance with the grand signor. He therefore interested himself warmly in the dispute, and or∣dered
<PB N="172" REF="1750"/>
his general to assemble an army on the frontiers of Lithuania, which, by overawing the Poles that were in the interest of the prince of Conti, con∣siderably influenced the election. This extraordinary legislator, who was a strange compound of heroism and barbarity, conscious of the defects in his education, and of the gross ignorance that overspread his dominions, re∣solved to extend his ideas, and improve his judgment by travelling; and that he might be the less restricted by forms, or interrupted by officious curiosity, he determined to travel in disguise. He was extremely ambitious of becoming a maritime power, and in particular, of maintaining a fleet in the Black∣sea; and his immediate aim was to learn the principles of ship-building. He appointed an embassay for Holland, to regulate some points of commerce with the states general. Having intrusted the care of his dominions to persons in whom he could confide, he disguised himself, and travelled as one of their retinue. He first disclosed himself to the elector of Brandenburgh in Prussia, and afterwards to king William, with whom he conferred in private at Utrecht. He engaged himself as a common labourer with a ship-carpenter in Holland, whom he served for some months with wonderful patience and assiduity. He afterwards visited England, where he amused himself chiefly with the same kind of occupation. From thence he set out for Vienna, where receiving advices from his domini∣ons, that his sister was concerned in managing intrigues against his govern∣ment, he returned suddenly to Moscow, and found the machinations of the conspirators were already baffled by the vigilance and fidelity of the foreigners to whom he had left the care of the administration. His savage nature, however, broke out upon this occasion: he ordered some hundreds to be hanged all round his capital; and a good number were beheaded, he himself with his own hand performing the office of executioner.</P>

<P>The negotiations at Ryswick proceeded very slowly for some time. The Imperial ministers demanded, that France should make restitution of all the places and dominions she had wrested from the empire since the peace of Munster, whether by force of arms or pretence of right. The Spaniards claimed all that they could demand by virtue of the peace of Nimeguen and the treaty of the Pyrenees. The French affirmed, that if the preliminaries offered by Callieres were accepted, these propositions could not be taken into consideration. The Imperialists persisted in demanding a circumstantial answer, article by arti∣cle. The Spaniards insisted upon the same manner of proceeding, and called upon the mediator and Dutch ministers to support their pretensions. The ple∣nipotentiaries of France declared, they would not admit any demand or propo∣sition, contrary to the preliminary articles; but, were willing to deliver in a project of peace, in order to shorten the negotiation; and the Spanish ambassadors consented to this expedient. During these transactions, the earl of Portland held a conference with marechal Boufflers near Halle, in sight of the two opposite armies, which was continued in five successive meetings. On the second day of August they retired together to a house in the suburbs of Halle, and mutu∣ally signed a paper, in which the principal articles of the peace between France and England were adj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted. Next day king William quitted the camp, and retired to his house at L<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, confident of having taken such measures for a paci∣fication as could not be disappointed. The subject of this field-negotiation is said to have turned upon the interests of king James, which the French monarch
<PB N="173" REF="1760"/>
promised to abandon; and others suppose, that the first foundation of the par∣tition-treaty was layed in this conference. But, in all probability, William's sole aim was to put an end to an expensive and unsuccessful war, which had rendered him very unpopular in his own dominions, and to obtain from the court of France an acknowledgment of his title, which had since the queen's death become the subject of dispute. He perceived the emperor's back∣wardness towards a pacification, and foresaw numberless difficulties in discussing such a complication of interests by the common method of treating: he there∣fore chose such a step as he thought would alarm the jealousy of the allies, and quicken the negotiation at Ryswick. Before the congress was opened, king James had published two manifestos, addressed to the catholic and protestant princes of the confederacy, representing his wrongs, and craving redress; but, his remonstrances being altogether disregarded, he afterwards issued a third de∣claration, solemnly protesting against all that might or should be negotiated, regulated, or stipulated with the usurper of his realms, as being void of all rightful and lawful authority. On the twentieth day of July the French am∣bassadors produced their project of a general peace, declaring at the same time, that should it not be accepted before the last day of August, France would not hold herself bound for the conditions she now offered; but Caunitz the emperor's plenipotentiary protested, he would pay no regard to this limitation. On the thirtieth of August, however, he delivered to the mediator an ultimatum, im∣porting, That he adhered to the treaties of Westphalia and Nimeguen, and ac∣cepted of Strasburg with its appurtenances: That he insisted upon the restitution of Lorraine to the prince of that name: and demanded, That the church and chapter of Liege should be re-established in the possession of their incontestable rights. Next day the French plenipotentiaries declared, That the month of August being now expired, all their offers were vacated: That therefore the king of France would reserve Strasburg, and unite it, with its dependencies, to his crown for ever: that in other respects he would adhere to the project, and restore Barcelona to the crown of Spain; but, that these terms must be accepted in twenty days, otherwise he should think himself at liberty to recede. The mi∣nisters of the electors and princes of the empire joined in a written remon∣strance to the Spanish plenipotentiaries, representing the inconveniencies and dangers that would accrue to the Germanic body from France's being in posses∣sion of Luxemburg, and exhorting them in the strongest terms to reject all offers of an equivalent for that province. They likewise presented another to the states-general, requiring them to continue the war according to their en∣gagements, until France should have complied with the preliminaries. No re∣gard, however, was payed to either of these addresses. Then the Imperial am∣bassadors demanded the good offices of the mediator, on certain articles; but all that he could obtain of France was, that the term for adjusting the peace be∣tween her and the emperor should be prolonged till the first day of November, and in the mean time an armistice be punctually observed. Yet even these con∣cessions were made, on condition that the treaty with England, Spain, and Hol∣land, should be signed on that day, even though the emperor and empire should not concur.</P>

<P>Accordingly, on the twentieth day of September, the articles were subscribed by the Dutch, English, Spanish, and French ambassadors, while the
<PB N="174" REF="1770"/>
Imperial ministers protested against the transaction, observing, this was the se∣cond time that a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eparate peace had been concluded with France; and that the states of the empire, who had been imposed upon through their own credulity, would not for the future be so easily persuaded to engage in confederacies. In certain preparatory articles settled between England and France, king William promised to pay a yearly pension to queen Mary D'Este, of fifty thousand pounds, or such sum as should be established for that purpose by act of parlia∣ment. The treaty itself consisted of seventeen articles. The French king engag∣ed, that he would not disturb or disquiet the king of Great-Britain in the posses∣sion of his realms or government; nor assist his enemies, nor favour conspira∣cies against his person. This obligation was reciprocal. A free commerce was restored. Commissaries were appointed to meet at London, and settle the pre∣tensions of each crown to Hudson's bay, taken by the French during the late peace, and retaken by the English in the course of the war; and to regulate the limits of places to be restored, as well as the exchanges to be made. It was likewise stipulated, That, in case of a rupture, six months should be allowed to the subjects of each power for removing their effects: That the separate article of the treaty of Nimeguen, relating to the principality of Orange, should be in∣tirely executed: and, That the ratifications should be exchanged in three weeks from the day of signing. The treaty between France and Holland imported a general armistice, a perpetual amity, a mutual restitution, a reciprocal renun∣ciation of all pretensions upon each other, a confirmation of the peace with Savoy, a re-establishment of the treaty concluded between France and Bran∣denburgh, in the year one thousand six hundred and seventy-nine, a compre∣hension of Sweden, and all those powers that should be named before the ratifi∣cation, or in six months after the conclusion of the treaty. Besides, the Dutch mini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ters concluded a treaty of commerce with France, which was immedi∣ately put in execution. Spain had great reason to be satisfied with the pacifica∣tion, by which she recovered Gironne, Roses, Barcelona, Luxemburg, Char∣leroy, Mons, Courtray, and all the towns, fortresses, and territories taken by the French in the province of Luxemburg, Namur, Brabant, Flanders, and Hainault, except eighty-two towns and villages claimed by the French: this dispute was left to the decision of commissaries; or, in case they should not agree, to the determination of the states-general. A remonstrance in fa∣vour of the French protestant refugees in England, Holland, and Germany, was delivered by the earl of Pembroke to the mediator, in the name of the protestant allies, on the day that preceded the conclusion of the treaty; but, the French plenipotentiaries declared, in the name of their master, that as he did not pretend to prescribe rules to king William about the English subjects, he expected the same liberty with respect to his own. No other effort was made in behalf of those conscientious exiles: the treaties were ratified, and the peace proclaimed at Paris and London.</P>

<P>The emperor still held out, and perhaps was encouraged to persevere in his obstinacy by the success of his arms in Hungary, where his general, prince E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gene of Savoy, obtained a complete victory at Zenta over the forces of the grand signor, who commanded his army in person. In this battle, which was fought on the eleventh day of September, the grand vizir, the aga of the ja∣nizaries, seven <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd twenty bashaws, and about thirty thousand men, were killed
<PB N="175" REF="1780"/>
or drowned in the river Theysse; six thousand were wounded or taken, toge∣ther with all their artillery, tents, baggage, provision, and ammunition, the grand signor himself escaping with difficulty: a victory the more glorious and acceptable, as the Turks had a great superiority in point of number, and as t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Imperialists did not lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a thousand men during the whole action. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e emperor perceiving that the event of this battle had no effect in retarding the treaty, thought proper to make use of the armistice, and continue the nego∣tiation after the forementioned treaties had been signed. This was likewise the case with the princes of the empire; though those of the protestant persuasion complained, that their interest was neglected. In one of the articles of the treaty it was stipulated, That in the places to be restored by France, the ro∣man catholic religion should continue as it had been re-established. The am∣bassadors of the protestant princes joined in a remonstrance, demanding. That the lutheran religion should be r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stored in those places where it had formerly prevailed; but, this demand was rejected, as being equally disagreeable to France and the emperor. Then they refused to sign the treaty, which was now concluded between France, the emperor, and the catholic princes of the empire. By this pacification Treves, the Palatinate, and Lorraine, were restored to their respective owners. The counties of Spanheim and Veldentz, together with the dutchy of Deux<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Ponts, were ceded to the king of Sweden. Francis-Lewis Palatine was confirmed in the electorate of Cologne; and the cardinal of Furstemberg restored to all his rights and benefices. The claims of the dutchess of Orleans upon the Palatinate, were referred to the arbitration of France and the emperor; and in the mean time the elector palatine agreed to supply her highness with an annuity of one hundred thousand florins. The mi∣nisters of the protestant princes published a formal declaration against the clause relating to religion, and afterwards solemnly protested against the manner in which the negotiation had been conducted. Such was the issue of a long and bloody war, which had drained England of her wealth and people<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> almost in∣tirely ruined her commerce, debauched her morals, by encouraging venality and corruption, and entailed upon her the curse of foreign connexions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> well as a national debt, which has gradually increased to an intolerable burthen. After all the blood and treasure which had been expended, William'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ambition and revenge remained unsatisfied. Nevertheless, he reaped the solid advantage of seeing himself firmly established on the English throne; and the con∣federacy, though not successful in every instance, accomplished their great aim of putting a stop to the encroachments of the French monarch. They mortified his vanity, they humbled his pride and arrogance<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and compelled him to disgorge the acquisitions which, like a robber he had made, in violation of public faith, justice, and humanity. Had the allies been true to one another, had they acted from genuine zeal for the common interests of mankind, and pro∣secuted with vigour the plan which was originally concerted, Lewis would in a few campaigns have been reduced to the most abject state of disgrace, despond∣ence, and submission; for he was destitute of true courage and magn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nimity. King William having finished this important transaction, returned to England about the middle of November, and was received in Londo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amidst the accla∣mations of the people, who now again hailed him as their deliverer from a war, by the continuance of which they must have been infallibly beggared.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the king opened the session of parliament on the third day of December, he told them the war was brought to the end they all proposed, namely, an honourable peace. He gave them to understand there was a considerable debt on account of the fleet and army: that the revenues of the crown had been anticipated: and he expressed his hope, that they would provide for him during his life, in such a manner as would conduce to his own honour and that of the government. He recommended the maintenance of a considerable navy; and gave it as his opinion, that for the present England could not be safe without a standing army. He promised to rectify such corrup∣tions and abuses as might have crept into any part of the administration during the war; and effectually to discourage prophaneness and immorality. Finally, he assured them, that as he had rescued their religion, laws, and liberties, when they were in the extremest danger, so he should place the glory of his reign in preserving and leaving them intire to latest posterity. To this speech the com∣mons replied in an address, by a compliment of congratulation upon the peace, and an assurance, that they would be ever ready to assist and support his ma∣jesty, who had confirmed them in the quiet possession of their rights and liber∣ties; and by putting an end to the war fully completed the work of their deli∣verance. Notwithstanding these appearances of good humour, the majority of the house, and indeed of the whole nation, were equally alarmed and exaspe∣rated at a project for maintaining a standing army, which was countenanced at court, and even recommended by the king in his speech to the parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> William's genius was altogether military. He could not bear the thoughts of being a king without power. He could not without reluctance dismiss those officers who had given so many proofs of their courage and fidelity. He did not think himself safe upon the naked throne in a kingdom that swarmed with malcontents, who had so often conspired against his person and government. He dreaded the ambition and known perfidy of the French king, who still re∣tained a powerful army. He foresaw that a reduction of the forces would lessen his importance both at home and abroad, diminish the dependence upon his government, and disperse those foreigners in whose attachment he chiefly con∣fided. He communicated his sentiments on this subject to his confident the earl of Sunderland, who knew by experience the aversion of the people to a stand∣ing army; nevertheless encouraged him with hope of success, on the supposition that the commons would see the difference between an army raised by the king's private authority, and a body of veteran troops maintained by consent of par∣liament for the security of the kingdom. This was a distinction to which the people payed no regard. All the jealousy of former parliaments seemed to be roused by the bare proposal; and this was inflamed by a national prejudice
<PB N="178" REF="1810"/>
against the refugees, in whose favour the king had betrayed repeated marks of partial indulgence. They were submissive, tractable, and wholly dependent upon his will and generosity. The Jacobites failed not to cherish the seeds of dissatisfaction, and reproach the Whigs who countenanced this measure. They branded that party with apostacy from their former principles. They observed, that the very persons who in the late reigns endeavoured to abridge the prero∣gative, and deprive the king of that share of power which was absolutely ne∣cessary to actuate the machine of government, were now become advocates for maintaining a standing army in time of peace; nay, and impudently avowed, that their complaisance to the court in this particular, was owing to their desire of excluding from all share in the administration a faction disaffected to his majesty, which might mislead him into more pernicious measures. The majo∣rity of those who really entertained revolution principles, opposed the court, from apprehensions that a standing army once established, would take root and grow into an habitual maxim of government: that, should the people be dis∣armed, and the sword left in the hands of mercenaries, the liberties of the na∣tion must be entirely at the mercy of him by whom those mercenaries should be commanded. They might overawe elections, dictate to parliaments, and esta∣blish a tyranny before the people could take any measures for their own pro∣tection. They could not help thinking it was possible to form a militia, that with the concurrence of a fleet might effectually protect the kingdom from the dangers of an invasion. They firmly believed, that a militia might be regu∣larly trained to arms, so as to acquire the dexterity of professed soldiers, and they did not doubt they would surpass those hirelings in courage, considering that they would be animated by every concurring motive of interest, sentiment, and affection. Nay, they argued, that Britain, surrounded as it was by a bois∣terous sea, secured by floating bulwarks, abounding with stout and hardy inha∣bitats, did not deserve to be free, if her sons could not protect their liberties without the assistance of mercenaries, who were indeed the only slaves of the kingdom. Yet, among the genuine friends of their country, some individuals espoused the opposite maxims. They observed, that the military system of every government in Europe was now altered: that war was become a trade, and discipline a science not to be learned but by those who made it their sole pro∣fession: that therefore, while France kept up a large standing army of veterans, ready to embark on the opposite coast, it would be absolutely necessary for the safety of the nation to maintain a small standing force, which should be voted in parliament from year to year. They might have suggested another expe∣dient, which in a few years would have produced a militia of disciplined men. Had the soldiers of this small standing army been enlisted for a term of years, at the expiration of which they might have claimed their discharge, volunteers would have offered themselves from all parts of the kingdom, even from the desire of learning the use and exercise of arms, the ambition of being concerned in scenes of actual service, and the chagrin of little disappointments or temporary dis∣gusts, which yet would not have impelled them to enlist as soldiers on the com∣mon terms of perpetual slavery. In consequence of such a succession, the whole kingdom would soon have been stocked with members of a disciplined militia, equal, if not superior to any army of professed soldiers. But, this scheme would have defeated the purpose of the government, which was more
<PB N="179" REF="1820"/>
afraid of domestic foes, than of foreign enemies, and industriously avoided every plan of this nature, which could contribute to render the malcontents of the nation more formidable.</P>

<P>Before we proceed to the transactions of parliament in this session, it may not be amiss to sketch the out-lines of the ministry as it stood at this juncture. The king's affection for the earl of Portland had begun to abate, in proportion as his esteem for Sunderland increased, together with his consideration for Mrs. Villiers, who had been distinguished by some particular marks of his majesty's favour. These two favourites are said to have supplanted Portland, whose place in the king's bo∣som was now filled by Van K<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppel, a gentleman of Guelderland, who had first served his majesty as a page, and afterwards acted as a private secretary. The earl of Portland growing troublesome, from his jealousy of this rival, the king resolved to send him into honourable exile, in quality of amba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>dor extraordi∣nary to the court of France; and Tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbal, his friend and creature, was dis∣missed from the office of secretary, which the king conferred upon Vernon, a plodding man of business, who had acted as u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der-secretary to the duke of Shrewsbury. This nobleman rivalled the earl of Sunderland in his credit at the council<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>board, and was supported by Somers, lord-chan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellor of England, Russel, now earl of Orford, first lord of the admiralty, and Montague, chancellor of the exchequer. Somers was an upright judge, a plausible statesman, a con∣summate courtier, affable, mild, and insinuating. Orford appears to have been rough, turbulent, factious, and shallow. Montague had distinguished himself early by his poetical genius; but, he soon converted his attention to the culti∣vation of more solid talents. He rendered himself remarkable for his eloquence, discernment, and knowledge of the English constitution. To a delicate taste, he united an eager appetite for political studies. The first catered for the enjoy∣ments of fancy: the other was subservient to his ambition. He, at the same time, was the distinguished encourager of the liberal arts, and the professed patron of projectors. In his private deportment he was liberal, easy, and enter∣taining: as a statesman, bold, dogmatical, and aspiring.</P>

<P>The terrors of a standing army had produced such an universal ser∣ment in the nation, that the dependants of the court in the house of commons, durst not openly oppose the reduction of the forces: but, they shifted the bat∣tery, and employed all their address in persuading the house to agree, that a very small number should be retained. When the commons voted, That all the forces raised since the year one thousand six hundred and eighty, should be dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anded, the courtiers desired the vote might be recommitted, on pretence that it restrained the king to the old Tory regiments, on whose fidelity he could not rely. This motion, however, was over-ruled by a considerable majority. Then they proposed an amendment, which was rejected, and afterwards moved, That the sum of five hundred thousand pounds per annum should be granted for the maintenance of guards and garrisons. This provision would have maintained a very considerable number; but, they were again disappointed, and fain to em∣brace a composition with the other party, by which three hundred and fifty thousand pounds were allotted for the maintenance of ten thousand men; and they afterwards obtained an addition of three thousand marines. The king was extremely mortified at these resolutions of the commons; and even declared to his particular friends, that he would never have intermeddled with the affairs of
<PB N="180" REF="1830"/>
the nation, had he foreseen they would make such returns of ingratitude and distrust. His displeasure was aggravated by the resentment expressed against Sunderland, who was supposed to have advised the unpopular measure of retain∣ing a standing army. This nobleman, dreading the vengeance of the com∣mons, resolved to avert the vengeance of the impending storm, by resigning his off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce, and retiring from court, contrary to the intreaties of his friends, and the earnest desire of his majesty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The house of commons, in order to sweeten the unpalatable cup they had presented to the king, voted the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds per annum for the support of the civil li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, distinct from all other services. Then they passed an act, prohibiting the currency of silvered hammered coin, including a clause for making out new exchequer bills, in lieu of those which were or might be filled up with indorsements: another to open the correspon∣dence with France, under variety of provisos: a third for continuing the impri∣sonment of certain persons who had been concerned in the late conspiracy: and a fourth, granting further time for administring oaths with respect to tallies and orders in the exchequer, and bank of England. These bills having received the royal assent, they resolved to grant a supply, which, together with the funds al∣ready settled for that purpose, should be sufficient to answer and cancel all ex∣chequer bills, to the amount of two millions seven hundred thousand pounds. Another supply was voted for the payment and reduction of the army, including half-pay to such commission-officers as were natural born subjects of England. They granted one million four hundred thousand pounds, to make good defici∣encies. They resolved, That the sum of two millions three hundred and forty-eight thousand one hundred and two pounds, was necessary to pay off arrears, subsistence, contigencies, general-officers, guards, and garrisons, of which sum eight hundred and fifty-five thousand five hundred and two pounds, remained in the hands of the paymaster. Then they took into consideration the subsidies due to foreign powers, and the sums owing to contractors for bread and forage. Examining further the debts of the nation, they found the general debt of the navy amounted to one million three hundred and ninety-two thousand, seven hundred and forty-two pounds. That of the ordnance was equal to two hun∣dred and four thousand, one hundred and fifty-seven pounds. The transport∣debt contracted for the reduction of Ireland and other services, did not fall short of four hundred and sixty-six thousand, four hundred and ninety-three pounds; and they owed nine and forty thousand, nine hundred and twenty-nine pounds, for quartering and cloathing the army, which had been raised by one act of par∣liament in the year sixteen hundred and seventy-seven, and disbanded by ano∣ther in the year one thousand six hundred and seventy-nine. As this enormous load of debt could not be discharged at once, the commons passed a number of votes for raising sums of money, by which it was considerably lightened; and settled the funds for those purposes by the continuation of the land-tax and other impositions. With respect to the civil list, it was raised by a new subsidy of tonnage and poundage, the hereditary and temporary excise, a weekly portion from the revenue of the post-office, the first-fruits and tenths of the clergy, the fines in the alienation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>office, and post-fines, the revenue of the wine-licence, money arising by sheriffs, prossers, and compositions in the exchequer, and seizures, the income of the dutchy of Cornwal, the rents of all other crown<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lands in
<PB N="181" REF="1840"/>
England or Wales, and the duty of four and a half per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon specie from Barbadoes and the Leeward-islands. The bill imported, That the overplus arising from these funds should be accounted for to parliament. Six hundred thousand pounds of this money was allotted for the purposes of the civil li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; the rest was granted for the jointure of fifty thousand pounds per annum, to be payed to queen Mary of Este, according to the stipulation at Ry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick; and to maintain a court for the duke of Gloucester, son of the princess Anne of Denmark, now in the ninth year of his age: but the jointure was never payed; nor would the king allow above fifteen thousand pounds per annum for the use of the duke of Gloucester, to whom Burnet bishop of Salisbury was appointed preceptor.</P>

<P>The commons having discussed the ways and means for raising the supplies of the ensuing year, that rose almost to five millions, took cognizance of some fraudulent indorsements of exchequer-bills, a species of forgery which had been practised by a confederacy, consisting of Charles Duncomb, receiver-general of the excise; Bartholomew Burton, who possessed a place in that branch of the revenue; John Knight, treasurer of the customs; and Reginald Marriot, a deputy-teller of the exchequer. This last turned evidence, and the proof turning out very strong and full, the house resolved to make examples of the delinquents. Duncomb and Knight, both members of parliament, were ex∣pelled<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. State Tracts. Burchet. Lives of the Admirals. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> and committed to the Tower; Burton was sent to Newgate; and bills of pains and penalties were ordered to be brought against them. The first, levelled at Duncomb, passed the lower-house, though not without great oppo∣sition, but was rejected in the house of lords by the majority of one voice. Duncomb, who was extremely rich, is said to have payed dear for his escape. The other two bills met with the same fate. The peers discharged Duncomb from his confinement; but he was re-committed by the commons, and re∣mained in custody till the end of the session. While the commons were em∣ployed on ways and means, some of the members in the opposition proposed, that one-fourth part of the money arising from improper grants of the crown, should be appropriated to the service of the public: but this was a very unpa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a∣table expedient, as it affected not only the Whigs of king William's reign, but also the Tories who had been gratified by Charles II. and his brother. A great number of petitions were presented against this measure, and so many difficulties raised, that both parties agreed to lay it aside. In the course of this inquiry, they discovered that one Railton held a grant in trust for Mr. Mon∣tague, chancellor of the exchequer. A motion was immediately made, that he should withdraw; but passed in the negative by a great majority. Far from prosecuting this minister, the house voted it was their opinion, That Mr. Mon∣tague, for his good services to the government, did deserve his majesty's favour.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1698.</NOTE> This extraordinary vote was a sure presage of success in the execution of a scheme which Montague had concerted against the East India company. They had been sounded about advancing a sum of money for the public service, by way of loan, in consideration of a parliamentary settlement; and they of∣fered to raise seven hundred thousand pounds on that condition: but, before they formed this resolution, another body of merchants, under the auspices of Montague, offered to lend two millions at eight per cent. provided they might
<PB N="182" REF="1850"/>
be gratified with an exclusive priviledge of trading to the East Indies. This proposal was very well received by the majority in the house of commons. A bill for this purpose was brought in with additional clauses of regulation. A petition was presented by the old company, representing their rights and claims under so many royal charters; the regard due to the property of above a thou∣sand families interested in the stock; as also to the company's property in India, amounting to forty-four thousand pounds of yearly revenue. They alledged they had expended a million in fortifications: that during the war they had lost twelve great ships, worth fifteen hundred thousand pounds: that since the last subscription they had contributed two hundred and ninety-five thousand pounds to the customs; with above eighty-five thousand pounds in taxes: that they had furnished six thousand barrels of gunpowder on a very pressing occasion; and eighty thousand pounds for the circulation of exchequer-bills, at a very critical juncture, by desire of the lords of the treasury, who owned that their com∣pliance was a very important service to the government. No regard being paid to their remonstrance, they undertook to raise the loan of two millions, and immediately subscribed two hundred thousand pounds as the first payment. The two proposals being compared and considered by the house, the majority declared for the bill, which was passed and sent up to the house of lords. There the old company delivered another petition, and was heard by council; nevertheless, the bill made its way, though not without opposition, and a formal protestation by one and twenty lords, who thought it was a hardship upon the present company; and doubted whether the separate trade allowed in the bill, concurrent with a joint stock, might not prove such an inconsistency as would discourage the subscription. This act, by which the old company was dissolved, in a great measure blasted the reputation of the Whigs, which had for some time been in the decline with the people. They had stood up as advocates for a standing army: they now unjustly superseded the East India company: they were accused of having robbed the public, by embezzling the national treasure, and amassing wealth by usurious contracts, at the expence of their fellow-subjects, groaning under the most oppressive burthens. Certain it is, they were at this period the most mercenary and corrupt undertakers that ever had been employed by any king or administration since the first establish∣ment of the English monarchy.</P>

<P>The commons now transferred their attention to certain objects in which the people of Ireland were interested. Colonel Mitchelborne, who had been joint-governor of Londonderry with doctor Walker, during the siege of that place, petitioned the house in behalf of himself, his officers and soldiers, to whom a considerable sum of money was due for subsistence; and the city itself implored the mediation of the commons with his majesty, that its ser∣vices and sufferings might be taken into consideration. The house having ex∣amined the allegations contained in both petitions, presented an address to the king, recommending the citizens of Londonderry to his majesty's favour, that they might no longer remain a ruinous spectacle to all, a scorn to their ene∣mies, and a discouragement to well-affected subjects: they likewise declared, that the governor and garrison did deserve some special marks of royal favour, for a lasting monument to posterity. To this address the king replied, that he would consider them, according to the desire of the commons. William Moly∣neux,
<PB N="183" REF="1860"/>
a gentleman of Dublin, having published a book to prove that the king∣dom of Ireland was independent of the parliament of England, the house ap∣pointed a committee to enquire into the cause and nature of this performance. An address was voted to the king, desiring he would give directions for the discovery and punishment of the author. Upon the report of the committee, the commons in a body presented an address to his majesty, representing the dangerous attempts which had been lately made by some of his subjects in Ire∣land, to shake off their subjection and dependence upon England; attempts which appeared not only from the bold and pernicious assertions contained in a book lately published, but more fully and authentically by some votes and proceedings of the commons in Ireland during their last session, when they transmitted an act for the better security of his majesty's person and govern∣ment; whereby an English act of parliament was pretended to be re-enacted, with alterations obligatory on the courts of justice and the great seal of Eng∣land. They therefore besought his majesty to give effectual orders for pre∣venting any such encroachments for the future, and the pernicious consequences of what was past, by punishing those who had been guilty thereof: that he would take care to see the laws which direct and restrain the parliament of Ire∣land, punctually observed, and discourage every thing which might have a ten∣dency to lessen the dependence of Ireland upon England. This remonstrance was graciously received, and the king promised to comply with their request.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The jealousy which the commons entertained of the government in Ireland, animated them to take other measures, that ascertained the subjection of that kingdom. Understanding that the Irish had established divers woollen manu∣factures, they, in another address, intreated his majesty to take measures for discouraging the woollen manufactures in Ireland, as they interfered with those of England, and promote the linen manufacture, which would be profitable to both nations. At the same time receiving information that the French had seduced some English manufacturers, and set up a great work for cloth-making in Picardy, they brought in a bill for explaining and better executing former acts for preventing the exportation of wool, fullers-earth, and scouring clay; and this was immediately passed into a law. A petition being presented to the house by the lustring company, against certain merchants who had smuggled alamodes and lustrings from France, even during the war, the committee of trade was directed to inquire into the allegations; and all the secrets of this traffic were detected. Upon the report, the house resolved that the manufacture of alamodes and lustrings set up in England, had been beneficial to the king∣dom: that there had been a destructive and illegal trade carried on during the war, for importing these commodities, by which the king had been defrauded of his customs, and the English manufactures greatly discouraged: that, by the smuggling vessels employed in this trade, intelligence had been carried into France during the war, and the enemies of the government conveyed from justice. Stephen Seignoret Rhené Baudoin, John Goudet, Nicholas Santini, Peter de Hearse, John Pierce, John Dumaitre, and David Barreau, were im∣peached at the bar of the house of lords; and pleading guilty, the lords im∣posed fines upon them according to their respective circumstances. They were in the mean time committed to Newgate, until those fines should be payed; and the commons addressed the king, that the money might be appropriated to the
<PB N="184" REF="1870"/>
maintenance of Greenwich-hospital. The house having taken cognizance of this affair, and made some new regulations in the prosecution of the African trade, presented a solemn address to the king, representing the general dege∣neracy and corruption of the age, and beseeching his majesty to command all his judges, justices, and magistrates, to put the laws in execution against pro∣faneness and immorality. The king professed himself extremely well pleased with this remonstrance, promised to give immediate directions for a reforma∣tion, and expressed his desire that some more effectual provision might be made for suppressing impious books, containing doctrines against the Trinity; doc∣trines which abounded at this period, and took their origin from the licence and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>igacy of the times.</P>

<P>In the midst of such immorality, Dr. Thomas Bray, an active divine, formed a plan for propagating the gospel in foreign countries. Missionaries, catechisms, liturgies, and other books for the instruction of ignorant people, were sent to the English colonies in America. This laudable design was sup∣ported by voluntary contribution; and the bill having been brought into the house of commons, for the better discovery of estates given to superstitious uses, Dr. Bray presented a petition, praying, that some part of these estates might be set apart for the propagation of the reformed religion in Maryland, Virginia, and the Leeward islands. About this period, a society for the reformation of manners was formed under the king's countenance and encouragement. Con∣siderable collections were made for maintaining clergymen to read prayers at certain hours in places of public worship, and administer the sacrament every Sunday. The members of this society resolved to inform the magistrates of all vice and immorality that should fall under their cognizance; and with that part of the fines, allowed by law to the informer, constitute a fund of charity. The business of the session being terminated, the king, on the third day of July, prorogued the parliament, after having thanked them in a short speech for the many testimonies of their affection he had received; and in two days after the prorogation it was dissolved <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the fifth day of January, a fire breaking out at Whitehall, through the carelessness of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the whole body of the palace, together with the new gallery, council-chamber, and se∣veral adjoining apartments, was intirely con∣sumed; but the banquetting-house was not af∣fected.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the month of January, the earl of Portland had set out on his embassy to France, where he was received with very particular marks of dis∣tinction. He made a public entry into Paris with such magnificence as is said to have astonished the French nation. He interceded for the protestants in that kingdom, against whom the persecution had been renewed with redoubled violence: he proposed that king James should be removed to Avignon, in which case his master would supply him with an honourable pension: but his remonstrances on both subjects proved ineffectual. Lewis, however, in a pri∣vate conference with him at Marli, is supposed to have communicated his pro∣ject of the partition-treaty. The earl of Portland, at his return to England, finding himself totally eclipsed in the king's favour, by Keppel, now created earl of Albemarle, resigned his employments in disgust; nor could the king's sollicitations prevail upon him to resume any office in the houshold: though he promised to serve his majesty in any other shape, and was soon employed to
<PB N="185" REF="1880"/>
negotiate the treaty of partition. If this nobleman miscarried in the purposes of his last embassy at the court of Versailles, the agents of France were equally unsuccesful in their endeavours to retrieve their commerce with England, which the war had interrupted. Their commissary sent over to London with powers to regulate the trade between the two nations, met with insuperable difficulties. The parliament had burthened the French commodities with heavy duties, which were already appropriated to different uses; and the chan∣nel of trade was in many respects entirely altered. The English merchants sup∣plied the nation with wines from Italy, Spain, and Portugal, with linen from Holland and Silesia; and manufactures of paper, hats, stuffs, and silks, had been set up and successfully carried on in England, by the French refugees.</P>

<P>By this time a ferment had been raised in Scotland, by the opposition and discouragements their new company had sustained. They had employed agents in England, Holland, and Hamburgh, to receive subscriptions. The adventurers in England were intimidated by the measures which had been taken in parliament against the Scottish company. The Dutch East India company took the alarm, and exerted all their interest to prevent their country∣men from subscribing; and the king permitted his resident at Hamburgh to present a memorial against the Scottish company, to the senate of that city. The parliament of Scotland being assembled by the earl of Marchmont as king's commissioner, the company presented it with a remonstrance, containing a de∣tail of their grievances, arising from the conduct of the English house of com∣mons, as well as from the memorial presented by the king's minister at Ham∣burgh, in which he actually disowned the act of parliament and letters-patent which had passed in their favour, and threatened the inhabitants of that city with his majesty's resentment, in case they should join the Scots in their under∣taking. They represented, that such instances of interposition had put a stop to the subscriptions in England and Hamburgh, hurt the credit of the com∣pany, discouraged the adventurers, and threatened the intire ruin of a design in which all the most considerable families of the nation were deeply engaged. The parliament having taken their case into consideration, sent an address to his majesty, representing the hardships to which the company had been ex∣posed, explaining how far the nation in general was concerned in the design, and intreating that he would take such measures as might effectually vindicate the undoubted rights and privileges of the company. This address was se∣conded by a petition from the company itself, praying, that his majesty would give some intimation to the senate of Hamburgh, permitting the inhabitants of that city to renew the subscriptions they had withdrawn: that, as a gracious mark of his royal favour to the company, he would bestow upon them two small frigates, then lying useless in the harbour of Burntisland: and that, in consideration of the obstructions they had encountered, he would continue their privileges and immunities, for such longer time as should seem reason∣able to his majesty. Though the commissioner was wholly devoted to the king, who had actually resolved to ruin this company, he could not appease the re∣sentment of the nation; and the heats in parliament became so violent, that he was obliged to adjourn to the fifth day of November. In this interval, the directors of the company understanding from their agent at Hamburgh, that the address of the parliament, and their own petition, had produced no effect
<PB N="186" REF="1890"/>
in their favour; they wrote a letter of complaint to the lord Seafield secretary of state, observing, that they had received repeated assurances of the king's having given orders to his resident at Hamburgh touching their memorial; and intreating the interposition of his lordship, that justice might be done to the company. The secretary, in his answer, promised to take the first con∣venient opportunity of representing the affair to his majesty; but he said this could not be immediately expected, as the king was much engaged in the af∣fairs of the English parliament. This declaration the directors considered, as it really was, a mere evasion, which helped to alienate the minds of that people from the king's person and government.</P>

<P>King William at this time revolved in his own mind a project of far greater consequence to the interest of Europe; namely, that of settling the succession to the throne of Spain, which in a little time would be vacated by the death of Charles II. whose constitution was already exhausted. He had been lately reduced to extremity, and his situation was no sooner known in France, than Lewis detached a squadron towards Cadiz, with orders to inter∣cept the plate fleet, in case the king of Spain should die before its arrival. William sent another fleet to protect the galleons; but it arrived too late for that service, and the nation loudly exclaimed against the tardiness of the equip∣ment. His catholic majesty recovered from his disorder, contrary to the ex∣pectation of his people; but continued in such an enfeebled and precarious state of health, that a relapse was every moment apprehended. In the latter end of July, king William embarked for Holland, on pretence of enjoying a recess from business, which was necessary to his constitution. He was glad of an op∣portunity to withdraw himself for some time from a kingdom in which he had been exposed to such opposition and chagrin. But the real motives of his voyage was a design of treating with the French king, remote from the observation of those who might have penetrated into the nature of his negotiation. He had ap∣pointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence, and as one of the number, nominated the earl of Marlborough, who had regained his favour, and been constituted governor to the duke of Gloucester. At his majesty's de∣parture, sealed orders were left with the ministry, directing, that sixteen thou∣sand men should be retained in the service, notwithstanding the vote of the commons, by which the standing army was limited to ten thousand. He al∣ledged, that the apprehension of troubles which might arise at the death of king Charles, induced him to transgress this limitation; and he hoped, that the new parliament would be more favourable. His enemies, however, made a fresh handle of this step, to depreciate his character in the eyes of the people.</P>

<P>Having assisted at the assembly of the states-general, and given audience to divers ambassadors at the Hague, he repaired to his house at Loo, attended by the earls of Essex, Portland, and Selkirk. There he was visited by count Tallard the French minister, who had instructions to negotiate the treaty concerning the Spanish succession. The earl of Portland, by his majesty's order, had communicated to secretary Vernon the principal conditions which the French king proposed: he himself wrote a letter to lord chan∣cellor Somers, desiring his advice with regard to the propositions, and full powers under the great seal, with blanks to be filled up occasionally, that he might immediately begin the treaty with count Tallard. At the same time he
<PB N="187" REF="1900"/>
strictly injoined secrecy. The purport of Portland's letter was imparted to the duke of Shrewsbury and Mr. Montague, who consulted with the chancellor and Vernon upon the subject; and the chancellor wrote an answer to the king, as the issue of their joint deliberation: but, before it reached his majesty, the first treaty of partition was signed by the earl of Portland and Sir Joseph Williamson. The contracting powers agreed, That in case the king of Spain should die without issue, the kingdom of Naples and Sicily, with the places de∣pending on the Spanish monarchy, and situated on the coast of Tuscany, or the adjacent islands, the marquisate of Final, the province of Guipuscoa; all places on the French side of the Pyrenees, or the other mountains of Navarre, Alva, or Biscay, on the other side of the province of Guipuscoa, with all the ships, vessels, and stores, should devolve upon the dauphin, in consideration of his right to the crown of Spain, which, with all its other dependencies, should descend to the electoral prince of Bavaria, under the guardianship of his father: That the dutchy of Milan should be settled on the emperor's second son the archduke Charles: That this treaty should be communicated to the emperor and the elector of Bavaria by the king of England and the states-ge∣neral: That if either should refuse to agree to this partition, his proportion should remain in sequestration until the dispute could be accommodated: That in case the electoral prince of Bavaria should die before his father, then the elector and his other heirs should succeed him in those dominions; and, should the archduke reject the dutchy of Milan, they agreed that it should be sequestred and governed by the prince of Vaudemont. It may be necessary to observe, that Philip IV. father to the present king of Spain, had settled his crown by will on the emperor's children: that the dauphin was son to Maria-Theresa, daughter of the same monarch, whose right to the succession Lewis had re∣nounced in the most solemn manner: as for the electoral prince of Bavaria, he was grandson to a daughter of Spain. This treaty of partition was one of the most impudent schemes of encroachment that tyranny and injustice ever planned. Lewis, who had made a practice of sacrificing all ties of honour and good faith, to the interest of his pride, vanity, and ambition, foresaw that he should never be able to accomplish his designs upon the crown of Spain, while Wil∣liam was left at liberty to form another confederacy against them. He there∣fore resolved to amuse him with a treaty, in which he should seem to act as umpire in the concerns of Europe. He knew that William was too much of a politician to be restricted by notions of private justice; and that he would make no scruple to infringe the laws of particular countries, or even the rights of a single nation, when the balance of power was at stake. He judged right in this particular. The king of England lent a willing ear to his proposals, and engaged in a plan for dismembring a kingdom, in despite of the natives, and in violation of every law human or divine.</P>

<P>While the French king cajoled William with this negotiation, the marquis d'Harcourt, his ambassador at Spain, was engaged in a game of a different nature at Madrid. The queen of Spain suspecting the designs of France, exerted all her interest in behalf of the king of the Romans, to whom she was nearly related. She new-modelled the council, bestowed the govern∣ment of Milan on prince Vaudemont, and established the prince of Hesse d'Armstadt as viceroy of Catalonia.

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning of December, the king arrived in England, where a new parliament had been chosen, and prorogued on account of his majesty's absence, prolonged by contrary winds, and tempestuous weather. His mini∣stry had been at very little pains to influence the elections, which generally fell upon men of revolution-principles, though they do not seem to have been much devoted to the person of their sovereign; yet their choice of Sir Thomas Lyttleton for speaker, seemed to presage a session favourable to the ministry. The two houses being convened on the sixth day of December, the king, in his speech, observed, That the safety, honour, and happiness of the kingdom, would in a great measure depend upon the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rength which they should think proper to maintain by sea and land. He desired they would make some fur∣ther progress in discharging the national debt, contrive effectual expedients for employing the poor, pass good bills for the advancement of trade, and the discouragement of profanity; and act with unanimity and dispatch. The commons of this new parliament were so irritated at the king's presuming to maintain a greater number of troops than their predecessors had voted, that they resolved he should feel the weight of their displeasure. They omitted the common compliment of an address: they resolved that all the forces of Eng∣land, in English pay, exceeding seven thousand men, should be forthwith dis∣banded; as also those in Ireland, exceeding twelve thousand; and that those retained should be his majesty's natural-born subjects. A bill was brought in on these resolutions, and prosecuted with peculiar eagerness, to the unspeak∣able mortification of king William, who was not only extremely sensible of the affront, but also particularly chagrined to see himself disabled from main∣taining his Dutch guards, and the regiments of French refugees, to which he was uncommonly attached. Before the meeting of the parliament, the mini∣stry gave him to understand, that they should be able to procure a vote for ten or twelve thousand; but they would not undertake for a greater number. He professed himself dissatisfied with the proposal, observing, that they might as well disband the whole, as leave so few. The ministers would not run the risque of losing all their credit, by proposing a greater number; and having re∣ceived no directions on this subject, sat silent when it was debated in the house of commons.</P>

<P>Such was the indignation of William, kindled by this conduct of his ministry and his parliament, that he threatened to abandon the government; and had actually penned a speech to be pronounced to both houses on that oc∣casion: but he was diverted from this purpose by his ministry and confidents, and resolved to pass the bill by which he had been so much ossended. Ac∣cordingly, when it was ready for the royal assent, he went to the house of peers, where having sent for the commons, he told them, that although he might think himself unkindly used, in being deprived of his guards, which had constantly attended him in all his actions, yet as he believed nothing could be more fatal to the nation, than any distrust or jealousy between him and his parliament, he was come to pass the bill, according to their desire. At the same time, for his own just<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, and in discharge of the trust reposed in him, he declared, that in his judgment the nation was left too much exposed; and
<PB N="190" REF="1930"/>
that it was incumbent upon them to provide such a strength as might be necessary for the safety of the kingdom. They thanked him in an address, for this un∣deniable proof of his readiness to comply with the desires of his parliament. They assured him, he should never have reason to think the commons were un∣dutiful or unkind; for, they would, on all occasions, stand by, and assist him in the preservation of his sacred person, and in the support of his government, against all his enemies whatsoever. The lords presented an address to the same effect; and the king assured both houses, he entertained no doubts of their loyalty and affection. He forthwith issued orders for reducing the army to the number of seven thousand men, to be maintained in England under the name of guards and g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrisons; and, hoping the hearts of the commons were now mollified, he made another effort in favour of his Dutch guards, whom he could not dismiss without the most sensible regret. Lord Ranelagh was sent with a written message to the commons, giving them to understand, that the necessary preparations were made for transporting the guards who came with him into England, and that they should embark immediately, unless out of consideration to him, the house should be disposed to find a way for continuing them longer in the service; an expedient which his majesty would take very kindly. The commons, instead of complying with his inclination, presented an address, in which they professed unspeakable grief, that he should propose any thing to which they could not consent with due regard to the constitution, which he had come over to restore, and so often hazarded his royal person to preserve. They reminded him of the declaration, in which he had promised, that all the foreign forces should be sent out of the kingdom. They observed, that nothing conduced more to the happiness and welfare of the nation, than an intire confidence between the king and people, which could no way be so firmly established as by intrusting his sacred person with his own subjects, who had so eminently signalized themselves during the late long and expensive war. They received a soothing answer to this address, but remained firm to their purpose, in which the king was fain to acquiesce; and the Dutch guards were transported to Holland. At a time when they declared themselves so well pleased with their deliverer, such an opposition in an affair of very little consequence, sa∣voured more of clownish obstinacy than of patriotism. In the midst of all their professions of regard, they entertained a national prejudice against him∣self and all the foreigners in his service. Even in the house of commons his person was treated with great disrespect in virulent insinuations. They sug∣gested, that he neither loved nor trusted the English nation: that he treated the natives with the most disagreeable reserve; and chose his confidents from the number of strangers that surrounded him: that, after every session of parlia∣ment, he retired from the kingdom, to enjoy an indolent and inglorious privacy with a few favourites. These suggestions were certainly ture. He was ex∣tremely disgusted with the English, whom he considered as malicious, ignorant, and ungrateful, and he took no pains to disguise his sentiments.</P>

<P>The commons having effected a dissolution of the army, voted fif∣teen thousand seamen, and a proportionable fleet for the security of the king∣dom, and granted one million four hundred and eighty-four thousand fifteen pounds, for the services of the year, to be raised by a tax of three shillings in the pound upon lands, personal estates, pensions, and offices. A great number
<PB N="191" REF="1940"/>
of priests and roman catholics, who had been frighted away by the revolution, were now encouraged by the treaty of Ryswick to return, and appeared in all public places of London and Westminster, with remarkable effrontery. The enemies of the government whispered about, that the treaty contained a secret article in favour of those who professed that religion; and, some did not even scruple to insinuate, that William was a papist in his heart. The commons, alarmed at the number and insolence of those religionists, desired the king, in an address, to remove by proclamation all papists and nonjurors, from the city of London and parts adjacent, and put the laws in execution against them, that the wicked designs they were always hatching might be effectually disappointed. The king gratified them in their request with a proclamation, which was not much regarded; but, a remarkable law was enacted against papists in the course of the ensuing session. The old East-India company, about this period, peti∣tioned the lower house, to make some provision that their corporation might subsist for the residue of the term of twenty-one years, granted by his majesty's charter: that the payment of the five pounds percent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the late act for settling the trade to the East-Indies, might be settled and adjusted in such a manner, as not to remain a burthen on the petitioners: and, that such further considerations might be had for their relief, and for the preservation of the East-India trade, as should be thought reasonable. A bill was brought in upon the subject of this petition; but rejected at the second reading. Discontents had risen to such a height, that some members began to assert, they were not bound to maintain<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Kennet. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph.</NOTE> the votes and credit of the former parliament; and, upon this maxim would have contributed their interest towards a repeal of the act made in favour of the new company: but such a scheme was of too dangerous consequence to the public credit, to be carried into execution.</P>

<P>That spirit of peevishness which could not be gratified with this sacrifice, produced an inquiry into the management of naval affairs, which was aimed at the earl of Orford, a nobleman whose power gave umbrage, and whose wealth excited envy. He officiated both as treasurer of the navy, and lord-commissioner of the admiralty, and seemed to have forgot the sphere from which he had risen to title and office. The commons drew up an address, com∣plaining<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>In Ireland nothing of moment was transacted. The parliament of that kingdom passed an act for raising one hundred and twenty thousand pounds, on lands, tenements, and hereditaments, to defray the expence of maintain∣ing twelve thousand men who had been voted by the commons of England: then the assembly was prorogued. A new commission afterwards arrived at Dublin, constituting the duke of Bolton, the earl of Berkley and Galway, lord-justices of Ireland. The clamour in Scotland increased against the ministry, which had disowned their company, and in a great measure defeated the design from which they had promised themselves such heaps of treasure. Notwith∣standing the discouragements to which their company had been exposed, they fitted out two of four large ships which had been built at Hamburgh for their service. They were loaded with a cargo for traffic, with some artillery and military stores; and the adventurers embarking, to the number of twelve hundred, they sailed from the frith of Edinburgh with some tenders, on the seventeenth day of July in the preceding year. At Madera they took in a supply of wine, and then steered to Crab-island in the neighbourhood of St. Thomas, lying between Santa Cruz and Porto Rico. Their design was to take possession of this little island; but, when they entered the road, they saw a large tent pitched upon the strand, and the Danish colours flying. Finding themselves anticipated in this quarter, they directed their course to the coast of Darien, where they treated with the natives for the establishment of their colony, and taking posses∣sion of the ground, to which they gave the name of Caledonia, began to execute their plan of erecting a town under the appellation of New Edinburgh, by the direction of their council, consisting of Patterson the projector, and six other directors. They had no sooner completed their settlement, than they wrote a letter to the king, containing a detail of their proceedings. They pretended they had received un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ubted intelligence, that the French intended to make a settlement on that coast; and that their colony would be the means of pre∣venting the evil consequences which might arise to his majesty's kingdom and dominions from the execution of such a scheme. They acknowledged his good∣ness in granting those privileges by which their company was established; and they implored the continuance of his royal favour and protection, as they had punctually adhered to the conditions of the act of parliament and the patent they had obtained.</P>

<P>By this time, however, the king was resolved to crush them effec∣tually. He understood that the greater part of their provisions had been con∣sumed before they set sail from Scotland, and foresaw that they must be reduced to a starving condition, if not supplied from the English colonies. That they might be debarred of all such assistance, he sent orders to the governors of Jamaica, and the other English settlements in America, to issue proclamations, prohibiting, under the severest penalties, all his majesty's subjects from holding any correspondence with the Scottish colony, or assisting it in any shape, with arms, ammunition, or provision, on pretence that they had not communicated their design to his majesty, but had peopled Dari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, in violation of the peace subsist∣ing between him and his allies. Their colony was, doubtless, a very dangerous incroachment upon the Spaniards, as it would have commanded the passage be∣tween Porto Bello and Panama, and divided the Spanish empire in America. The French king complained of the invasion, and offered to supply the court
<PB N="193" REF="1960"/>
of Madrid, with a fleet to dislodge the interlopers. Colonna, marquis de Ca∣nales, the Spanish ambassador at the court of London, presented a memorial to king William, remonstrating against the settlement of this colony, as a mark of disregard, and a breach of the alliance between the two crowns; and declaring, that his master would take proper measures against such hostilities. The Scots affirmed, that the natives of Darien were a free people, whom the Spaniards had in vain attempted to subdue: that therefore they had an original and un∣controvertible right to dispose of their own lands, part of which the company had purchased for a valuable consideration. But, there was another cause more powerful than the remonstrances of the Spanish court, to which this colony fell a sacrifice; and, that was the jealousy of the English traders and planters. Darien was said to be a country abounding with gold, which would in a little time enrich the adventurers. The Scots were known to be an enterprising and pertinacious people; and their harbour near Golden-island was already declared a free-port. The English apprehended that their planters would be allured into this new colony, by the double prospect of finding gold and plundering the Spa∣niards: that the buccancers in particular would choose it as their chief residence: that the plantations of England would be deserted: that Darien would become another Algiers: and, that the settlement would produce a rupture with Spain, in consequence of which the English effects in that kingdom would be confiscated. The Dutch too, are said to have been jealous of a company, which in time might have proved their competitors in their illicit commerce to the Spanish main, and to have hardened the king's heart against the new settlers, whom he abandoned to their fate, notwithstanding the repeated petitions and remonstrances of their constituents. Famine compelled the first adventurers to quit the coast: a second recruit of men and provisions was sent thither from Scotland; but, one of their ships laden with provision being burned by accident, they likewise deserted the place: an∣other reinforcement arrived, and being better provided than the two former, might have maintained their footing; but, they were soon divided into factions that rendered all their schemes abortive. The Spaniards advanced against them; when finding themselves incapable of withstanding the enemy, they sollicited a capitulation, by virtue of which they were permitted to retire. Thus vanished all the golden dreams of the Scottish nation, which had engaged in this design with incredible eagerness, and even embarked a greater sum of money than ever they had advanced upon any other occasion. They were now not only disappointed in their expectations of wealth and affluence, but a great number of families was absolutely ruined by the miscarriage of the design, which they imputed solely to the conduct of king William. The whole kingdom of Scot∣land seemed to join in the clamour that was raised against their sovereign. They taxed him with double-dealing, inhumanity, and base ingratitude, to a people who had lavished their treasure and best blood in support of his govern∣ment, and in the gratification of his ambition; and had their power been equal to their animosity, in all probability a rebellion would have ensued.</P>

<P>William, mean while, enjoyed himself at Loo, where he was visited by the duke of Zell, with whom he had long cultivated an intimacy of friend∣ship. During his residence in this place, the earl of Portland and the grand pensionary of Holland, frequently conferred with the French ambassador count Tallard, upon the subject of the Spanish succession. The first plan of the partition
<PB N="194" REF="1970"/>
being defeated by the death of the young prince of Bavaria, they found it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecessary to concert another, and began a private negotiation for that purpose. The court of Spain, apprised of their intention, sent a written remonstrance to Mr. Stanhope, the English minister at Madrid, expressing their resentment at this unprecedented method of proceeding, and desiring that a stop might be put to those intrigues, seeing the king of Spain would of himself take the ne∣cessary steps for preserving the public tranquillity, in case he should die without heirs of his body. A representation of the same kind was made to the mini∣sters of France and Holland; and the marquis de Canales, the Spanish ambas∣sador at London, delivered a memorial to the lords-justices, couched in the most virulent terms, against this transaction, and even appealing from the king to the parliament. This Spaniard was pleased with an opportunity to insult king William, who hated his person, and had forbid him the court, on account of his appearing covered in his majesty's presence. The regency had no sooner commu∣nicated this paper to the king, than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e ordered the ambassador to quit the king∣dom in eighteen days, and to remain within his own house till the time of his departure. He was at the same time given to understand, that no writing would be received from him or any of his domestics. Mr. Stanhope was di∣rected to complain at Madrid of the affront offered to his master, which he stiled an insolent and saucy attempt to stir up sedition in the kingdom, by ap∣pealing to the people and parliament of England against his majesty. The court of Spain justified what their minister had done, and in their turn ordered Mr. Stanhope to leave their dominions. Don Bernardo de Quiros, the Spa∣nish ambassador in Holland, prepared a memorial on the same subject, to the states-general; which, however, they refused to accept. These remonstrances did not interrupt the negotiation, in which Lewis was so eager, that he com∣plained of William, as if he had not employed his whole influence in prevailing upon the Dutch to signify their accession to the articles agreed upon by France and England: but, his Britannic majesty found means to remove this jea∣lousy.</P>

<P>About the middle of October he returned to England, and con∣ferred upon the duke of Shrewsbury the office of chamberlain, vacant since the resignation of Sunderland. Mr. Montague at the same period resigned his seat at the treasury-board, together with the chancellorship of the exchequer, either foreseeing uncommon difficulty in managing a house of commons, after they had been dismissed in ill humour, or dreading the interest of his enemies, who m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght procure a vote, that his two places were inconsistent. The king opened the session of parliament on the sixteenth day of November, with a long speech, advising a further provision for the safety of the kingdom by sea and land, and the repairs of ships <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd fortifications; exhorting the commons to make good the desiciencies of the funds, discharge the debts of the nation, and provide the necessary supplies. He recommended some good bill for the more effectual pre∣venting and punishing unlawful and clandestine trading; and expressed a desire, that some method should be taken for employing the poor, which were become a burthen to the kingdom. He assured them, his resolutions were to countenance virtue and discourage vice: and, that he would decline no difficulties and dan∣gers, where the welfare and prosperity of the nation might be concerned. He concluded with these words, <Q>“Since then our aims are only for the general
<PB N="195" REF="1980"/>
good, let us act with confidence in one another; which will not fail, with God's blessing, to make me a happy king, and you a great and flourishing people.”</Q> The commons were now become wanton in their disgust. Though they had received no real provocation, they resolved to mortify him with their proceedings. They affected to put odious interpretations on the very harmless expression of, "Let us act with confidence in one another." Instead of an address of thanks, according to the usual custom, they presented a sullen remonstrance, complaining, that a jealousy and disgust had been raised of their duty and af∣fection; and desiring he would shew marks of his high displeasure towards all persons who had prefumed to misrepresent their proceedings to his majesty. He declared, in his answer, that no person had ever dared to misrepresent their pro∣ceedings; and, that if any should presume to impose upon him by such calum∣nies, he would treat them as his worst enemies.</P>

<P>The house was not in an humour to be appeased with soothing promises and protestations: they determined to distress him, by prosecuting his ministers. During the war the colonies of North-America had grown rich by pyracy. One Kidd, the master of a sloop, undertook to suppress the pyra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, provided the government would furnish him with a ship of thirty guns, well manned. The board of admiralty declaring, that such a number of seamen could not be spared from the public service, Kidd was equipped by the private subscription of the lord-chancellor, the duke of Shrewsbury, the earls of Rom∣ney, Orford, and Bellamont, Sir Edward Harrison, and colonel Levingstone of New<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>York. The king promised to contribute one half of the expence, and reserved to himself one tenth of the profits; but, he never advanced the money. Kidd being thus equipped, and provided with a commission to act against the French, as well as to make war on certain pyrates therein mentioned by name, set sail from Plymouth; but, instead of cruizing on the coast of America, di∣rected his course to the East Indies, where he himself turned pyrate, and took a rich ship belonging to the Moors. Having divided his booty with his crew, ninety of whom left him, in order to join other adventurers, he burned his own ship, and sailed with his prize to the West-Indies. There he purchased a sloop, in which he steered for North-America, leaving part of his men in the prize to remain in one of the Leeward-islands, until they should receive further instruc∣tions. Arriving on the coast of New-York, he sent one Emmet to make his peace with the earl of Bellamont, the governor of that province, who inveigled him into a negotiation, in the course of which he was apprehended. Then his lordship sent an account of his proceedings to the secretary of state, desiring, that he would send for the prisoners to England, as there was no law in that colony for punishing pyracy with death, and the majority of the people favour∣ed that practice. The admiralty, by order of the lords-justices, dispatched the ship Rochester to bring home the prisoners and their effects; but, after hav∣ing been tossed for some time with tempestuous weather, this vessel was obliged to return to Plymouth in a shattered condition; and the incident furnished the malcontents with a colour to paint the ministry as the authors and abettors of a pyratical expedition, which they wanted to screen from the cognizance of the public. The old East-India company had complained to the regency of the capture made by Kidd in the East-Indies, apprehending, as the vessel belonged to the Moors, they should be exposed to the resentment of the Mogul. In the
<PB N="196" REF="1990"/>
beginning of December this subject was brought abruptly into the house of commons, and a motion made, That the letters patent granted to the earl of Bellamont and others, of pyrates goods, were dishonourable to the king, against the law of nations, contrary to the laws and statutes of the land, invasive of property, and destructive of trade and commerce. A warm debate ensued, in the course of which, some members declamed with great bitterness against the chancellor and the duke of Shrewsbury, as partners in a pyratical scheme; but these imputations were refuted, and the motion was rejected by a great majority. Not, but that they might have justly stigmatized the expedition as a little mean adventure, in which those noblemen had embarked with a view to their own private advantage.</P>

<P>While this affair was in agitation among the commons, the atten∣tion of the upper house was employed upon the case of Dr. Watson, bishop of St. David's. This prelate was supposed to have payed a valuable consideration for his bishopric; and, after his elevation, had sold the preferments in his gift, with a view of being reimbursed. He was accused of simony; and, after a so∣lemn hearing before the archbishop of Canterbury and six suffragans, convicted and deprived. Then he pleaded his privilege: so that the affair was brought into the house of lords, who refused to own him as a peer after he had ceased to be a bishop. Thus disappointed, he had recourse to the court of delegates, by whom the archbishop's sentence was confirmed. The next effort that the commons made, with a view of mortifying king William, was to raise a cla∣mour against Dr. Burnet, bishop of Sarum. He was represented in the house as a very unfit preceptor for the duke of Gloucester, both as a Scottish man, and author of that pastoral letter which had been burned by order of the par∣liament, for asserting, that William had a right to the crown from conquest. A motion was made for addressing his majesty, that this prelate might be dismissed from his employment, but rejected by a great majority. Burnet had acted with uncommon integrity in accepting the trust. He had declined the office, which he was in a manner forced to accept. He had offered to resign his bishopric, thinking the employment of a tutor would interfere with the duty of a pastor. He insisted upon the duke's residence all the summer at Windsor, which is in the diocese of Sarum; and added to his private charities the whole income of his new office.</P>

<P>The circumstance on which the anticourtiers built their chief hope of distressing or disgracing the government, was the inquiry into the Irish for∣feitures, which the king had distributed among his own dependants. The com∣missioners appointed by parliament to examine these particulars, were Annesley, Trenchard, Hamilton, Langford, the earl of Drogheda, Sir Francis Brewster, and Sir Richard Leving. The first four were actuated by all the virulence of faction: the other three were secretly guided by ministerial influence. They began their inquiry in Ireland, and proceeded with such severity as seemed to flow rather from resentment to the court, than from a love of justice and abhor∣rence of corruption. They in particular scrutinized a grant of an estate which the king had made to Mrs. Villiers, now countess of Orkney, so as to expose his majesty's partiality for that favourite, and subject him to an additional load of popular od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m. In the course of their examination, the earl of Drogheda, Leving, and Brewster, opposed the rest of the commissioners in divers articles of
<PB N="197" REF="2000"/>
the report, which they refused to sign, and sent over a memorial to the house of commons, explaining their reasons for dissenting from their colleagues. By this time, however, they were considered as hirelings of the court, and no re∣gard was payed to their representations. The others delivered their report, de∣claring, that a million and an half of money might be raised from the sale of the confiscated estates; and a bill was brought in for applying them to the use of the public. A motion being made to reserve a third part for the king's dispo∣sal; it was over-ruled: then the commons passed an extraordinary vote, im∣porting, That they would not receive any petition from any person whatsoever concerning the grants: and, That they would consider the great services per∣formed by the commissioners appointed to inquire into the forfeited estates. They resolved, That the four commissioners who had signed the report, had ac∣quitted themselves with understanding, courage, and integrity: and, That Sir Richard Leving, as author of groundless and scandalous aspersions cast upon his four colleagues, should be committed prisoner to the Tower. They afterwards came to the following resolution, which was presented to the king in form of an address: That the procuring and passing those grants had occasioned great debts upon the nation, and heavy taxes upon the people, and highly re∣flected upon the king's honour: and, That the officers and instruments con∣cerned in the same, had highly failed in the performance of their trust and duty. The king answered, That he was not only led by inclination, but thought himself obliged in justice<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to reward those who had served well in the reduction of Ireland, out of the estates forfeited to him by the rebellion in that kingdom. He observed, that as the long war had left the nation much in debt, their taking just and effectual ways for lessening that debt, and supporting pub∣lic credit, was what, in his opinion, would best contribute to the honour, inte∣rest, and safety of the kingdom. This answer kindled a flame of indignation in the house. They forthwith resolved, That the adviser of it had used his ut∣most endeavours to create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the king and his people.</P>

<P>They prepared, finished, and passed a bill of resumption. They ordered the report of the commissioners, together with the king's promise and speeches, and the former resolutions of the house touching the for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eited estates in Ireland, to be printed and published for their justification; and they resolved, That the procuring or passing exorbitant grants by any member, now of the privy-council, or by any other that had been a privy-counsellor, in this, or any former reign, to his use or benefit, was a high crime and misdemeanour. That justice might be done to purchasers and creditors in the act of resumption, thir∣teen trustees were authorised and impowered to hear and determine all claims relating to those estates, to sell them to the best purchasers; and the money arising from the sale was appropriated to pay the arrears of the army. It passed under the title of a bill for granting an aid to his majesty, by the sale of the forfeited and other estates and interests in Ireland; and, that it might un∣dergo no alteration in the house of lords, it was consolidated with the money∣bill for the services of the year. In the house of lords it produced warm de∣bates; and some alterations were made, which the commons unanimously re∣jected. They seemed to be now more than ever exasperated against the minis∣try, and ordered a list of the privy-council to be be layed before the house.
<PB N="19$" REF="2010"/>
The lords demanded conferences, which served only to exasperate the two houses against each other; for, the lords insisted upon their amendments, and the commons were so provoked at their interfering in a money-bill, that they de∣termined to give a loose to their resentment. They ordered all the doors of their house to be shut, that no members should go forth. Then they took into consideration the report of the Irish forfeitures, with the list of the privy-counsel∣lors; and a question was moved, That an address should be made to his majesty, to remove John lord Somers, chancellor of England, from hispresence and coun∣cils for ever. This, however, was carried in the negative by a great majority. The king was extremely chagrined at the bill, which he considered as an in∣vasion of his prerogative, an insult on his person, and an injury to his friends and servants; and, he at first resolved to hazard all the consequences of refusing to pass it into a law: but, he was diverted from his purpose by the remonstrances of those in whom he chiefly confided. He could not, however, dissemble his<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>net. Oldmixon. Cole's Mem. State Tracts. Lamberty.

He became fullen, peevish, and morose; and his enemies did not fail to make use of this additional ill humour, as a proof of his aversion to the English people. Though the motion against the chancellor had miscarried, the commons resolved to address his majesty, that no person who was not a na∣tive of his dominions, except his royal highness prince George of Denmark, should be admitted into his majesty's councils in England or Ireland. This re∣solution was levelled against the earls of Portland, Albemarle, and Galway; but, before the address could be presented, the king went to the house of peers, and having passed the bill which had produced such a ferment, with some others, commanded the earl of Bridgewater, speaker of the house in the absence of the chancellor, who was indisposed, to prorogue the parliament to the twenty-third day of May.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

Boiling still with indig∣nation against the lord-chancellor, who had turned many disaffected persons out of the commission of the peace, the house ordered a bill to be prepared for qualifying justices of the peace; and appointed a committee to inspect the com∣missions. This reporting, that many dissenters, and men of small fortunes de∣pending on the court, were put into those places, the commons declared, in an address, That it would much conduce to the service of his majesty, and the good of this kingdom, that gentlemen of quality and good estates should be restored, and put into the commissions of the peace and lieutenancy: and, that men of small estates be neither continued, nor put into the said commissions. The king assured them he was of the same opinion: that he would give directions accordingly. They were so mollified by this instance of his condescension, that they thanked him in a body for his gracious answer. They passed a bill to exculpate such as had neglected to sign the association, either through mistake, or want of opportunity. Having received a petition from the Lancashire clergy, complaining of the insolence and attempts of popish priests, they appointed a committee to inquire how far the laws against popish refugees had been put in
<PB N="199" REF="2020"/>
execution; and upon the report a bill was brought in, complying with the prayer of the petition. It decreed a further reward to such persons as should discover and convict popish priests and jesuits; and perpetual imprisonment for those convicted on the oath of one or more witnesses. It enacted, That no person born after the twenty-fifth day of March next ensuing, being a papist, should be capable of inheriting any title of honour or estate within the kingdom of England, dominion of Wales, or town of Berwick upon Tweed: and, That no papist should be capable of purchasing any lands, tenements, or heredita∣ments, either in his own name, or in the name of any other person in trust for him. Several alterations were made in this first draught, before it was finished and sent up to the lords, some of whom proposed amendments: these, however, were not adopted; and the bill obtained the royal assent, contrary to the ex∣pectation of those who prosecuted the measure, on the supposition that the king was a favourer of papists. After all, the bill was deficient in necessary clauses to enforce execution; so that the law was very little regarded in the sequel.</P>

<P>The court sustained another insult from the old East-India com∣pany, who petitioned the house, that they might be continued by parliamen∣tary authority during the remaining part of the time prescribed in their charter. They, at the same time, published a state of their case, in which they expatiated upon the equity of their claims, and magnified the injuries they had undergone. The new company drew up an answer to this remonstrance, exposing the cor∣rupt practices of their adversaries. But, the influence of their great patron, Mr. Montague, was now vanished: the supply was not yet discussed, and the mi∣nistry would not venture to provoke the commons, who seemed propitious to the old company; and actually passed a bill in their favour. This meeting with no opposition in the upper house, was enacted into a law, renewing their esta∣blishment: so that now there were two rival companies of merchants trad∣ing to the East-Indies. The commons, not yet satisfied with the vexations to which they had exposed their sovereign, passed a bill to appoint commis∣sioners for taking and examining the public accounts. Another law was made, to prohibit the use of India silks and stuffs which interfered with the English manufactures: a third, to take off the duties on the exportation of woollen manufactures, corn, grain, meal, bread, and biscuit: and a fourth, in which provision was made for punishing governors, or commanders in chief of plantations and colonies, in case they should commit any crimes or acts of in∣justice and oppression in the exercise of their administration.</P>

<P>The people of Scotland still continued in violent agitation. They published a pamphlet, containing a detail of their grievances, which they in a great measure ascribed to his majesty. A complaint being pre∣ferred to the house of commons against this performance, it was voted a false, scandalous, and traitorous libel, and ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. The commons addressed his majesty, to issue his royal proclamation for apprehending the author, printer, and publisher, of the said libel; and he complied with their request. The Scottish company had sent up an address to the king, in behalf of some adventurers who were wrongfully detained prisoners in Carthagena; but lord Basil Hamilton, who undertook the charge of this petition, was refused admittance to his majesty, on pretence of his being suspected of disaffection to the government. The
<PB N="200" REF="2030"/>
king, however, wrote to his council for Scotland, that he would demand the enlargement of the prisoners, and countenance any laudable measure that could advance the trade of that kingdom. The directors of the company, not con∣tent with this declaration, importuned their lord chancellor, who was in Lon∣don, to procure access for lord Basil Hamilton; and the ministry took shelter from their sollicitations behind a parliamentary inquiry. The subject of the Scottish colony being introduced into the house of lords, where the ministerial influence preponderated, a vehement deb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te arose, not from any regard to the interest of Scotland, but from mere opposition to the court, which however tri∣umphed in the issue. A motion was made, that the settlement of the Scotch colony at Darien, was inconsistent with the good of the plantation-trade of England; and passed in the affirmative by a small majority. Then they presented an address, declaring their sympathy with the losses of their fellow-subjects, and their opi∣nion, that a prosecution of the design must end, not only in far greater disap∣pointments to themselves, but also prove very inconvenient to the trade and quiet of the kingdom. They reminded him of the address of both houses, touching that settlement; and they expressed their approbation of the orders he had sent to the governors of the plantations on this subject. The king, in his answer to the address, in which the commons refused to concur, took the oppor∣tunity of exhorting them to consider of an union between the two kingdoms, as a measure, than which nothing could more contribute to their mutual security and advantage. The lords, in pursuance of this advice, prepared a bill, ap∣pointing certain commissioners of the realm of England to treat with commissi∣oners of Scotland for the weal of bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h kingdoms; but, it was obstructed in the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se of commons, who were determined to thwart every step that might tend to lessen the disgust, or appease the animosity of the Scottish nation. The mal∣contents insinuated, that the ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g's opposition to the Scottish company<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> flowed neither from his regard to the interest of England, nor from his punctual ob∣servance of treaties with Spain; but, solely from his attachment to the Dutch, who maintained an advantageous trade from the island of Curacoa to the Spa∣nish plantations in America, and were apprehe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sive that the Scottish colony would deprive them of this commerce. This interpretation served as fuel to the flame already kindled in Scotland, and industriously blown up by the ca∣lumnies of the Jacobites. Their parliament adopted the company as a national concern, by voting, That the colony of Caledonia in Darien was a legal and rightful settlement, which the parliament would maintain and support. On account of this resolution the session was for some time discontinued; but, when the Sco<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s understood their new settlement was totally abandoned, their capital lost, and all their hope intirely vanished, the whole nation was seized with a transport of fury. They loudly exclaimed, that they had been sacrificed and ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ely betrayed in that quarter where they were intitled to protection. They concerted an address to the king, couched in a very high strain, representing the necessity of an immediate parliament. It was circulated about the kingdom for subscriptions, signed by a great number of those who sat in parliament, and presented to the king by lord Ross, who with some others was deputed for that purpose. The king told them, they should know his intention in Scot∣land; and in the mean time, adjourned their parliament by proclamation. The people, exasperated at this new provocation, began to form the draught of a
<PB N="201" REF="2040"/>
second national address, to be signed by the shires and boroughs of the kingdom: but, before this could be finished, the king wrote a letter to the duke of Queens∣berry, and the privy council of that nation, which was published for the satis∣faction of the people. He professed himself grieved at the nation's loss, and willing to grant what might be needful for the relief and ease of the kingdom. He assured them he had their interest at heart; and that his good subjects should have convincing proofs of his sincere inclination to advance the wealth and prosperity of that his antient kingdom. He said he hoped this declara∣tion would be satisfactory to all good men: that they would not suffer them∣selves to be misled; nor give advantage to enemies, and ill-designing persons, ready to seize every opportunity of embroiling the government. He gave them to understand, that his necessary absence had occasioned the late adjournment; but as soon as God should bring him back, their parliament should be assembled. Even this explanation, seconded by all the credit and address of his ministers, failed in allaying the national ferment, which rose to the very verge of rebellion.</P>

<P>The king, who, from his first accession to the throne, had veered occasionally from one party to another, according to the circumstances of his affairs, and the opposition he encountered, was at this period so incensed and embarrassed by the caprice and insolence of the commons, that he willingly lent an ear to the leaders of the Tories, who undertook to manage the parlia∣ment according to his pleasure, provided he would part with some of his mi∣nisters, who were peculiarly odious to the commons. The person against whom their anger was chiefly directed, was the lord chancellor Somers, the most active leader of the Whig-party. They demanded his dismission, and the king exhorted him to resign his office; but he refusing to take any step that might indicate a fear of his enemies, or a consciousness of guilt, the king sent a peremptory order for the seals by the lord Jersey, to whom Somers de∣livered them without hesitation. They were successively offered to lord chief∣justice Holt, and Trevor the attorney-general, who declined accepting such a precarious office. Mean while the king granted a temporary commission to three judges to sit in the court of chancery; and at length bestowed the seals, with the title of lord-keeper, on Sir Nathan Wright, one of the serjeants at law, a man but indifferently qualified for the office to which he was now pre∣ferred. Though the king seemed altogether attached to the Tories, and in∣clined to a new parliament, no person appeared to take the lead in the affairs of government; and, indeed, for some time <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the administration seemed to be under no particular direction.</P>

<P>During the transactions of the last session, the negotiation for a second partition-treaty was carried on in London by the French minister Tal∣lard, in conjunction with the earls of Portland and Jersey, and soon brought to perfection. On the twenty-first day of February, the treaty was signed in London; and, on the twenty-fifth of the next month, it was subscribed at the Hague by Briord the French envoy, and the plenipotentiaries of the states ge∣neral. By this convention the treaty of Ryswick was confirmed. The con∣tracting parties agreed, That in case of his catholic majesty's dying without issue, the dauphin should possess, for himself and his heirs, the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, the islands of St. Stephano, Porto Hercole, Orbitello, Telamone, Porto-Longone, Piombino, the city and marquisate of Final, the province

Whether the French king was really sincere in his professions at this juncture, or proposed this treaty with a view to make a clandestine use of it at the court of Spain for more interested purposes, it is not easy to determine: at first, however, it was concealed from the notice of the public, as if the parties had resolved to take no step in consequence of it, during the life of his catholic majesty.</P>

<P>In the beginning of July, the king embarked for Holland, after having appointed a regency to govern the kingdom in his absence. On the twenty-ninth day of the same month, the young duke of Gloucester, the only remaining child of seventeen whom the princess Anne had borne, died of a malignant fever, in the eleventh year of his age. His death was much la∣mented by the greater part of the English nation, not only on account of his promising talents and gentle behaviour, but also as it left the succession unde∣termined, and might create disputes of fatal consequence to the nation. The Jacobites openly exulted in an event which they imagined would remove the chief bar to the interest of the prince of Wales; but the protestants generally turned their eyes upon the princess Sophia, electress dowager of Hanover, and grand-daughter of James I. It was with a view to concert the establishment of her succession, that the court of Brunswick now returned the visit of king William. The present state of affairs in England, however, afforded a very uncomfortable prospect. The people were generally alienated from the person and government of the reigning king, upon whom they seem to have furfeited. The vigour of their minds was destroyed by luxury and sloth: the severity of their morals was relaxed by a long habit of venality and corruption. The king's health began to decline, and even his faculties decayed apace. No per∣son was appointed to ascend the throne when it should become vacant. The Jacobite faction alone was eager, vigilant, enterprising, and elate. They dis∣patched Mr. Graham, brother of lord Preston, to the court of St. Germain's, immediately after the death of the duke of Gloucester: they began to bestir themselves all over the kingdom. A report was spread, that the princess Anne had privately sent a m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssage to her father; and Britain was once more threat∣ened with civil war, confusion, anarchy, and ruin.</P>

<P>In the mean time, king William was not inactive. The kings of Denmark and Poland, with the elector of Brandenburg, had formed a league to crush the young king of Sweden, by invading his dominions on dif∣ferent sides. The Poles actually entered Livonia, and undertook the siege of Riga; while the king of Denmark having demolished some forts in Holstein, the duke of which was connected with Sweden, invested Tonninghen. The Swedish minister in England demanded that assistance of William which
<PB N="203" REF="2060"/>
had been stipulated in a late renewal of the antient treaty between England and Sweden. The states of Holland were sollicited to the same purpose. Ac∣cordingly, a fleet of thirty sail, English and Dutch, was sent to the Baltic, un∣der the command of Sir George Rooke, who joined the Swedish squadron and bombarded Copenhagen, to which the Danish fleet had retired. At the same time, the duke of Lunenburg, with the Swedish forces which happened to be at Bremen, passed the Elbe, and marched to the assistance of the duke of Hol∣stein. The Danes immediately abandoned the siege of Tonninghen; and a body of Saxons, who had made an irruption into the territories of the duke of Brunswick, were obliged to retreat in disorder. By the mediation of William, a negotiation was begun for a treaty between Sweden and Denmark, which, in order to quicken, Charles the young king of Sweden made a descent upon the isle of Zealand. This was executed with great success. Charles was the first man who landed; and here he exhibited such marks of courage and conduct, far above his years, as equally astonished and intimidated his adversaries. Then he determined to besiege Copenhagen; a resolution which struck such terror into the Danes, that they proceeded with redoubled diligence in the treaty, which was brought to a conclusion, between Denmark, Sweden, and Holstein, about the middle of August. Then the Swedes retired to Schonen, and the squadrons of the maritime powers returned from the Baltic.</P>

<P>When the new partition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treaty was communicated by the mini∣sters of the contracting parties to the other powers of Europe, it generally met with a very unfavourable construction. Saxony and the northern crowns were still embroiled with their own quarrels, consequently could not give much at∣tention to such a remote transaction. The princes of Germany appeared cautious and dilatory in their answers, unwilling to be concerned in any plan that might excite the resentment of the house of Austria. The elector of Brandenburg, in particular, had set his heart upon the regal dignity, which he hoped to ob∣tain from the favour and authority of the emperor. The Italian states were averse to the partition-treaty, from their apprehension of seeing France in pos∣session of Naples, and other districts of their country. The duke of Savoy af∣fected a mysterious neutrality, in hope of being able to barter his consent for some considerable advantage. The Swiss cantons declined acceding as gua∣rantees. The emperor expressed his astonishment that any disposition should be made of the Spanish monarchy, without the consent of the present possessor, and the states of the kingdom. He observed, that neither justice or decorum could warrant the contracting powers to compel him, who was the rightful heir, to accept a part of his inheritance within three months, under penalty of for∣feiting even that share to a third person not yet named; and he declared, that he could take no final resolution, until he should know the sentiments of his catholic majesty, on an affair in which their mutual interest was so nearly con∣cerned. Leopold was actually engaged in a negotiation with the king of Spain, who signed a will in favour of his second son Charles; yet he took no measures to support the disposition, either by sending the archduke with a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uf∣ficient force into Spain, or by detaching troops into Italy.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The people of Spain were exasperated at the insolence of the three foreign powers who pretended to parcel out their dominions. Their pride took the alarm, at the prospect of their monarchy's being dismembered; and the
<PB N="204" REF="2070"/>
g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andees repined at the thought of losing so many lucrative governments, which they now enjoyed. The king's life became every day more and more precarious, from frequent returns of his disorder. The ministry was weak and divided, the nobi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity factious, and the people discontented. The hearts of the nation had been alienated from the house of Austria, by the insolent carriage and rapacious disposition of the queen Mariana. The French had gained over to their interests the cardinal Portocarrero, the marquis de Monterey, with many other noblemen and persons of distinction. These perceiving the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntiments of the people, employed their emissaries to raise a general cry that France alone could maintain the succession intire; that the house of Austria was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeble and exhausted, and any prince of that line must owe his chief sup∣port to detestable heretics. Portocarrero tampered with the weakness of his sovereign. He repeated and exaggerated all these suggestions: he advised him to consult his holiness pope Innocent XII. on this momentous point of regu∣lating the succession. That pontiff, who was a creature of France, having taken the advice of a college of cardinals, determined, that the renunciation of Maria Theresa, was invalid and null, as being founded upon compulsion, and contrary to the fundamental laws of the Spanish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>narchy. He therefore exhorted king Charles to contribute to the propagation of the faith, and the repose of Christendom, by making a new will in favour of a grandson of the French monarch. This admonition was seconded by the remonstrances of Portocarrero; and the weak prince complied with the proposal. In the mean time, the king of France seemed to act heartily, as a principal in the treaty of partition. His ministers at foreign courts co-operated with those of the mari∣time powers, in solliciting the accession of the different powers in Europe. When count Zinzendorf, the Imperial ambassador at Paris, presented a me∣morial, desiring to know what part France would act, should the king of Spain voluntarily place a grandson of Lewis upon the throne, the marquis de Torcy answered in writing, that his most christian majesty would by no means listen to such a proposal: nay, when the emperor's minister gave them to under∣stand that his master was ready to begin a separate negotiation with the court of Versailles touching the Spanish succession, Lewis declared he could not treat on that subject without the concurrence of his allies.</P>

<P>The nature of the partition-treaty was no sooner known in England, than condemned by the most intelligent part of the nation. They first of all complained, that such an important affair should be concluded with∣out the advice of parliament. They observed, that the scheme was unjust, and the execution of it hazardous: that, in concerting the terms, the maritime powers seemed to have acted as partisans of France; for the possession of Naples and the Tuscan ports would subject Italy to her dominion, and inter∣fere with the English trade to the Levant and Mediterranean; while Guipus∣coa, on any future rupture, would afford another inlet into the heart of the Spanish dominions: they, for these reasons, pronounced the treaty destructive of the balance of power, and prejudicial to the interest of England. All these arguments were trumpeted by the malcontents, so that the whole kingdom echoed with the clamour of disaffection; while Sir Christopher Musgrave, and others of the Tory faction, began to think in earnest of establishing the suc∣cession of the English crown upon the person of the prince of Wales. They
<PB N="205" REF="2080"/>
are said to have sent over Mr. Graham to St. Germain's with overtures to this purpose, and an assurance that a motion would be made in the house of com∣mons, to pass a vote that the crown should not be supported in the execution of the partition-treaty. King William was not ignorant of the censure he had undergone, and not a little alarmed to find himself so unpopular among his own subjects. That he might be the more able to bestow his attention effectually upon the affairs of England, he resolved to take some measures for the satis∣faction of the Scottish nation. He permitted the parliament of that kingdom to meet on the twenty-eighth day of October, and wrote a letter to them from his house at Loo, containing an assurance that he would concur in every thing that could be reasonably proposed for maintaining and advancing the peace and welfare of their kingdom. He promised to give his royal assent to such acts as they should frame for the better establishment of the presbyterian discipline, for preventing the growth of popery, suppressing vice and immorality, encourag∣ing pi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and virtue, preserving and securing personal liberty, regulating and advancing trade, retrieving the losses, and promoting the interest of their African and Indian companies. He expressed his concern that he could not assert the company's right of establishing a colony at Darien, without disturb∣ing the peace of Christendom, and entailing a ruinous war on that his ancient kingdom. He recommended unanimity and dispatch in raising competent taxes for their own defence; and told them he had thought fit to continue the duke of Queensberry in the office of high-commissioner. Notwithstanding this soothing address, the national resentment continued to rage, and the parlia∣ment seemed altogether intractable. By this time the company had received certain tidings of the intire surrender of their settlement; and, on the first day of the session, they represented to parliament, that for want of due protectio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abroad, some persons had been encouraged to break in upon their privileges even at home. This remonstrance was succeeded by another national address to the king, who told them he could not take any further notice of that affair, since the parliament was now assembled; and he had already made a declara∣tion, with which he hoped all his faithful subjects would be satisfied. Never∣theless, he found it absolutely necessary to practise other expedients for allaying the ferment of that nation. His ministers and their agents bestirred them∣selves so successfully, that the heats in parliament were entirely cooled, and the outcry of the people subsided into unavailing murmurs. The parliament resolved, That in consideration of their great deliverance by his majesty; and in that, next under God, their safety and happiness wholly depended on his preservation and that of his government, they would support both to the ut∣most of their power, and maintain such forces as should be requisite for those ends. They passed an act for keeping on foot three thousand men for two years, to be maintained by a land-tax. Then the commissioner produced the king's letter, desiring to have eleven hundred men on his own account to the first day of June following: they forthwith complied with his request, and were prorogued to the sixth of May. The supernumerary troops were sent over to the states-general; and the earl of Argyle was honoured with the title of duke, as a recompence for having concurred with the commissioner in ma∣naging this session of parliament.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>King William had returned to England on the eighteenth day of October, not a little chagrined at the perplexities in which he found himself involved; and, in the beginning of the next month, he received advice that the king of Spain was actually dead. He could not be surprised at this event, which had been so long expected; but it was attended with a circumstance which he had not foreseen. Charles, by his last will, had declared the duke of Anjou, second son of the dauphin, the sole heir of the Spanish monarchy. In case this prince should die without issue, or inherit the crown of France, he willed that Spain should devolve to the duke of Berry, in default of him and children, to the archduke Charles and his heirs, failing of whom, to the duke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>of Savoy and his posterity. He likewise recommended a match between the duke of Anjou and one of the archdutchesses. When this testament was first notified to the French court, Lewis seemed to hesitate between his incli∣nation and engagements to William and the states-general. Madam de Main∣tenon is said to have joined her influence to that of the dauphin, in persuading the king to accept of the will; and Pontchartrain was engaged to support the same measure. A cabinet-council was called in her apartment. The rest of the ministry declared for the treaty of partition: the king affected a kind of neu∣trality. The dauphin spoke for his son, with an air of resolution he had never assumed before: Pontchartrain seconded his arguments: Madam de Maintenon asked what the duke of Anjou had done to provoke the king, that he should be barred of his right to that succession? Then the rest of the mem∣bers espoused the dauphin's opinion; and the king owned himself convinced by their reasons. In all probability the decision of this council was previously settled in private. After the will was accepted, Lewis closetted the duke of Anjou, to whom he said, in presence of the marquis des Rios, <Q>“Sir, the king of Spain has made you a king. The grandees demand you; the people wish for you, and I give my consent Remember only, you are a prince of France. I recommend to you to love your people, to gain their affection by the lenity of your government, and render yourself worthy of the throne you are going to ascend.”</Q> The new monarch was congratulated on his ele∣vation by all the princes of the blood: nevertheless, the duke of Orleans and his son protested against the will, because the archduke was placed next in succession to the duke of Berry, in bar of their right as descendants of Anne of Austria, whose renunciation could be of no more force than that of Maria-Theresa. On the fourth day of December, the new king set out for Spain, to the frontiers of which he was accompanied by his two brothers.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When the will was accepted, the French minister de Torcy endeavoured to justify his master's conduct to the earl of Manchester, who re∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded at Paris in the character of ambassador from the court of London. He observed, That the treaty of partition was not likely to answer the ends for which it had been concerted: That the emperor had refused to accede: That it was relished by none of the princes to whom it had been communicated: That the people of England and Holland had expressed their discontent at the pro∣spect of France's being in possession of Naples and Sicily: That if Lewis had rejected the will, the archduke would have had a double title, derived from the former will, and that of the late king: That the Spaniards were so averse to the division of their monarchy, there would be a necessity for conquering the
<PB N="207" REF="2100"/>
whole kingdom before the treaty could be executed: That the ships to be fur∣nished by Great Britain and Holland would not be sufficient for the purposes of such a war; and it was doubtful whether England and the states-general would engage themselves in a greater expence. He concluded with saying, That the treaty would have been more advantageous to France than the will, which the king accepted purely from a desire of preserving the peace of Europe. His master hoped therefore the good understanding would subsist between him and the king of Great Britain. The same reasons were communicated by Briord the French ambassador at the Hague, to the states-general, who ordered their envoy at Paris to deliver a memorial to the French king, expressing their surprize at his having accepted the will; and their hope, that as the time spe∣cified for the emperor's acceding to the treaty was not expired, his most christian majesty would take the affair again into his consideration, and adhere to his engagements in every article. Lewis, in his answer to this memorial, which he dispatched to all the courts of Europe, declared, That what he chiefly con∣sidered was the principal design of the contracting parties, namely, the main∣tenance of peace in Europe; and that, true to this principle, he only departed from the words, that he might the better adhere to the spirit of the treaty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>With this answer he sent a letter to the states, giving them to understand, that the peace of Europe was so firmly established by the will of the king of Spain, in favour of his grandson, that he did not doubt their ap∣probation of his succession to the Spanish crown. The states observed, That they could not declare themselves upon an affair of such consequence, without consulting their respective provinces. Lewis admitted the excuse, and assured them of his readiness to concur with whatever they should desire for the security of the Spanish Netherlands. The Spanish ambassador at the Hague presented them with a letter from his new master, who likewise notified his accession to all the powers of Europe, except the king of England. The emperor loudly exclamed against the will, as being more iniquitous than the treaty of parti∣tion; and threatened to do himself justice by force of arms. The Spaniards apprehending that a league would be formed between his Imperial majesty and the maritime powers, for setting aside the succession of the duke of Anjou; and, conscious of their own inability to defend their dominions, resigned them∣selves intirely to the protection of the French monarch. The towns in the Spanish Netherlands and the dutchy of Milan admitted French garrisons: a French squadron anchored in the port of Cadiz, and another was detached to the Spanish settlements in the West Indies. Part of the Dutch army that was quartered in Luxemburg, Mons, and Namur, were made prisoners of war, because they would not own the king of Spain, whom their masters had not yet acknowledged. The states were overwhelmed with consternation by this event, especially when they considered their own naked situation, and reflected that the Spanish garrisons might fall upon them before they could assemble a body of troops for their defence. The danger was so imminent, that they re∣solved to acknowledge the king of Spain without further hesitation, and wrote a letter to the French king for that purpose: this was no sooner received, than orders were issued for sending back their battalions.</P>

<P>How warmly soever king William resented the conduct of the French king, in accepting the will so diametrically opposite to his engagements,
<PB N="208" REF="2110"/>
he dissembled his chagrin, and behaved with such reserve and apparent indifference, that some people naturally believed he had been privy to the transaction. Others imagined that he was discouraged from engaging in a new war by his bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ly infirmities, which daily encreased; and the opposition in par∣liament, to which he should be inevitably exposed. But his real aim was to conceal his sentiments, until he should have sounded the opinions of other powers in Europe, and seen how far he could depend upon his new ministry. He now seemed to repose his chief confidence in the earl of Rochester, who had undertaken for the Tories, and was declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Lord Godolphin was appointed first commissioner of the treasury: lord Tankerville succeeded lord Lonsdale lately deceased, as keeper of the privy-seal, and Sir Charles Hedges was declared secretary of state, in the room of the earl of Jersey: but the management of the commons was intrusted to Mr. Robert Harley, who had hitherto opposed the measures of the court with equal viru∣lence and ability. These new undertakers well knowing they should find it very difficult, if not impossible, to secure a majority i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the present parliament, prevailed on the king to dissolve it by proclamation; then the sheriffs were changed according to their nomination, and writs issued for a new parliament to meet on the sixth day of February. During this interval, count Wratislaw arrived in England, as ambassador from the emperor, to explain Leopold's title to the Spanish monarchy, supported by repeated intails and renunciations, confirmed in the most solemn treaties. This minister met with a very cold re∣ception from those who stood at the helm of affairs. They sought to avoid all connexions that might engage their country as a principal, in another war upon the continent, smarting as they were from the losses and incumbrances which the last had intailed upon them and their posterity. They seemed to think that Lewis, rather than involve himself in fresh troubles, would give all the secu∣rity that could be desired for maintaining the peace of Europe; or even should this be refused, they saw no reason for Britain's exhausting her wealth and strength to support a chimerical balance, in which her interest was but remotely concerned. It was their opinion, that by keeping aloof, she might render her∣self more respectable. Her reserve would overawe contending powers: they would in their turns sue for her assistance, and implore her good offices; and, instead of declaring herself a party, she would have the honour to decide as arbitress of their disputes. Perhaps they extended this idea too far; and, in all probability, their notions were inflamed by a spirit of faction. They hated the Whigs as their political adversaries, and detested the war, because it had been countenanced and supported by the interest of that party. The king believed, that a conjunction of the two monarchies of France and Spain would prove fatal to the liberties of Europe; and that this could not be prevented by any other method than a general union of the other European powers. He certainly was an enthusiast in his sentiments of this equilibrium; and fully convinced that he himself, of all the potentates in Christendom, was the only prince capable of adjusting the balance. The Imperial ambassador could not therefore be long ignorant of his real purpose, as he conversed with the Dutch favourites, who knew and approved of their master's design, though he avoided a declaration, until he should have rendered his ministers more propitious to his aim. The true secret, however, of that reserve with which
<PB N="209" REF="2120"/>
count Wratislaw was treated at his first arrival, was a private negotiation which the king had set on foot with the regency of Spain, touching a barrier in the Netherlands. He proposed, that certain towns should be garrisoned with English and Dutch troops, by way of security against the ambitious de∣signs of France; but the regency were so devoted to the French interest, that they refused to listen to any proposal of this nature. While this affair was in agitation, William resolved to maintain a wary distance from the emperor; but, when his effort miscarried, the ambassador found him much more open and accessible <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was distinguished by a glorious victory which the young king of Sweden ob∣tained in the nineteenth year of his age.

The czar quitted his army with some precipitation, as if he had been afraid of hazarding his person, while Charles advanced through ways that were thought impracticable, and surprised the enemy.

He took a great number of prisoners, with all their baggage, tents, and artillery, and entered Narva in triumph.</NOTE>.</P>

The king had previously told Sir Tho∣mas Lyttleton, it would be for his service that he should yield his pretensions to Harley at this juncture; and that gentleman agreed to absent himself from the house on the day of election. The king observed, in his speech, That the nation's loss in the death of the duke of Gloucester had rendered it abso∣lutely necessary for them to make further provision for the succession of the crown in the protestant line: That the death of the king of Spain had made such an alteration in the affairs of the continent, as required their ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re deli∣beration. The rest of his harrangue turned upon the usual topics of demand∣ing supplies for the ensuing year, reminding them of the deficiencies and public debts, recommending to their inquiry the state of the navy and fortifications; exhorting them to encourage commerce, employ the poor, and proceed with vigour and unanimity in all their deliberations. Though the elections had been generally carried in favour of the Tory interest, the ministry had secured but one part of that faction. Some of the most popular leaders, such as the duke of Leeds, the marquis of Normanby, the earl of Nottingham, Seymour, Musgrave, How, Finch, and Showers, had been either neglected or found re∣fractory, and resolved to oppose the court-measures with all their influence. Besides, the French king knowing that the peace of Europe would in a great measure depend on the resolutions of the English parliament, is said to have distributed great sums of money in England, by means of his minister Tallard, in order to strengthen the opposition in the house of commons. Certain it is, the nation abounded at this period with the French coins called Louis d'or and pistoles; but whether this redundancy was owing to a balance of trade in fa∣vour of England, or to the largesses of Lewis, we shall not pretend to deter∣mine. We may likewise observe, that the infamous practice of bribing electors had never been so flagrant as in the choice of representatives for this parliament.

The scandalous traffic had been chiefly carried on by the Whig-party, and there∣fore their antagonists resolved to spare no pains in detecting their corruption. Sir Edward Seymour distinguished himself by his zeal and activity, brought some of these practices to light, and, in particular, stigmatized the new East-India company, for having been deeply concerned in this species of venality. An inquiry being set on foot in the house of commons, several elections were declared void; and, divers persons who had been illegally returned, were first expelled the house, and afterwards detained in prison. Yet these prosecutions were carried on with such partiality as plainly indicated that they flowed rather from party-zeal than from patriotism.</P>

<P>A great body of the commons had resolved to present an address to his majesty, desiring he would acknowledge the king of Spain; and the motion, in all probability, would have been carried by a considerable majority, had not one hold and lucky expression given such a turn to the debate, as induced the anti∣courtiers to desist. One Mr. Monkton, in the heat of his declamation against this measure, said, he expected the next vote would be for owning the pretended prince of Wales. Though there was little or no connexion between these two subjects, a great many members were startled at the insinuation, and deserted the measure, which was dropped accordingly. The king's speech being taken into consideration, the house resolved to support his majesty and his govern∣ment; to take such effectual measures as might best conduce to the interest and safety of England, and the preservation of the protestant religion. This reso∣lution was presented in an address to the king, who received it favourably. At the same time, he layed before them a memorial he had received from the states-general, and desired their advice and assistance in the points that consti∣tuted the substance of this remonstrance. The states gave him to understand, that they had acknowledged the duke of Anjou as king of Spain: that France had agreed to a negotiation, in which they might stipulate the necessary condi∣tions for securing the peace of Europe; and, that they were firmly resolved to do nothing without the concurrence of his majesty and their other allies. They, therefore, begged he would send a minister to the Hague, with necessary powers and instructions to co-operate with them in this negotiation; and, in case it should prove ineffectual, or Holland be suddenly invaded by the troops which Lewis had ordered to advance towards their frontiers, they relied on the assist∣ance of England, and hoped his majesty would prepare the succours stipulated by treaty, to be used, should occasion require. The memorial was likewise com∣municated to the house of lords. Mean while the commons desired, that the treaties between England and the states-general should be layed before their house. These being perused, they resolved upon an address, to desire his majesty would enter into such negotiations with the states-general and other potentates, as might most effectually conduce to the mutual safety of Great-Britain and the United-Provinces, as well as to the preservation of the peace of Europe; and to assure him of their support and assistance, in performance of the treaty subsisting between England and the states-general. This resolution, however, was not carried without great opposition from those who were averse to the nation's involving itself in another war upon the continent. The king professed himself extremely well pleased with this address, and told them he would immediately order his
<PB N="2$$" REF="2140"/>
ministers abroad to act in concert with the states-general and other powers, for the attainment of those ends they proposed.</P>

<P>He communicated to the commons a letter written by the earl of Melfort to his brother the earl of Perth, governor to the pretended prince of Wales. It had been mislayed by accident, and came to London in the French mail. It contained a scheme for another invasion of England, together with some reflections upon the character of the earl of Middleton, who had supplanted him at the court of St. Germain's. Melfort was a mere projector, and seems to have had no other view than that of recommending himself to king James, and bringing his rival into disgrace. The house of lords, to whom the letter was also imparted, ordered it to be printed, and next day presented an address, thanking his majesty for his care of the protestant religion; desiring all the trea∣ties made since the last war might be layed before them; requesting him to en∣gage in such alliances as he should think proper for preserving the ballance of power in Europe; assuring him of their concurrence; expressing their acknow∣ledgment for his having communicated Melfort's letter; desiring he would give order for seizing the horses and arms of disaffected persons; for removing pa∣pists from London; and for searching after those arms and provisions of was mentioned in the letter: finally, they requested him to equip speedily a sufficient fleet for the defence of himself and his kingdom. They received a gracious answer to this address, which was a further encouragement to the king to put his own private designs in execution; and towards the same end the letter contri∣buted not a little, by inflaming the fears and resentment of the nation against France, which in vain disclaimed the earl of Melfort as a fantastical schemer, to whom no regard was payed at the court of Versailles. The French ministry complained of the publication of this letter, as an attempt to sow jealousies be∣tween the two crowns; and, as a convincing proof of their sincerity, banished the earl of Melfort to Angers.</P>

<P>The credit of exchequer bills was so lowered by the change of the ministry, and the lapse of the time allotted for their circulation, that they fell near twenty per cent to the prejudice of the revenue, and the discredit of the government in foreign countries. The commons having taken this affair into consideration, voted, That provision should be made from time to time for making good the principal and interest due on all parliamentary funds; and afterwards passed a bill for renewing the bills of credit, commonly called Ex∣chequer bills. This was sent up to the lords on the sixth day of March, and on the thirteenth received the royal assent. The next object that engrossed the attention of the commons was the settlement of the succession to the throne, which the king had recommended to their consideration in the beginning of the session. Having deliberated on this subject, they resolved, That for the pre∣servation of the peace and happiness of the kingdom, and the security of the protestant religion, it was absolutely necessary, that a further declaration should be made of the limitation and succession of the crown in the protestant line, after his majesty and the princess, and the heirs of their bodies respectively: and, That further provision should be first made for the security of the rights and liberties of the people. Mr. Harley moved, That some conditions of go∣vernment might be settled as preliminaries, before they should proceed to the nomination of the person, that their security might be complete. Accordingly
<PB N="212" REF="2150"/>
they deliberated on this subject, and agreed to the following resolutions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That whoever shall hereafter come to the possession of this crown, shall join in com∣mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion with the church of England as by law established: That, in case the crown and imperial dignity of this realm shall hereafter come to any person, not being a native of this kingdom of England, this nation be not obliged to engage in any war for the defence of any dominions or territories which do not belong to the crown of England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without the consent of parliament: That no person who shall hereafter come to the possession of the crown, shall go out of the dominions of England, Scotland, or Ireland, without consent of parlia∣ment: That, from and after the time, that the further limitation by this act shall take effect, all matters and things relating to the well governing of this kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which are properly cognizable in the privy-council, by the laws and customs of the realm, shall be transacted there, and all resolutions taken there∣upon, shall be signed by such of the privy-council as shall advise and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent to the same: That after the limitation shall take effect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no person born out of the kingdom of England, Scotland, or Ireland, or the dominions thereunto be∣longing, although he be naturalized, and made a denizen (except such as are born of English parents<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be capable to be of the privy-council, or a mem∣ber of either house of parliament, or to enjoy any office or place of trust, either civil or military, or to have any grant of lands, tenements, or hereditaments from the crown to himself, or to any others in trust for him: That no person who has an office or place of profit under the king, or receives a pension from the crown<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shall be capable of serving as member of the house of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommons: That after the limitation shall take effect, judges commissions be made, quam∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> se bene gesserint, and their salaries ascertained and established; but, upon the address of both houses of parliament, it may be lawful to remove them: That no pardon under the great seal of England be pleadable to an impeach∣ment by the commons in parliament. Having settled these preliminaries, they resolved, That the princess Sophia, dutchess dowager of Hanover, be declared the next in succession to the crown of England, in the protestant line, after his majesty and the princess, and the heirs of their bodies respectively: and, That the further limitation of the crown be to the said princess Sophia and the heirs of her body, being protestants. A bill being formed on these resolutions, was sent up to the house of lords, where it met with some opposition from the mar∣quis of Normanby; and a protest was entered against it by the earls of Hunting∣ton and Plymouth, the lords Guilford and Jeffries. Nevertheless, it passed without amendments, and on the twelfth day of June received the royal assent: yet, the king was extremely mortified at the preliminary limitations, which he considered as an open insult on his own conduct and administration; not but that they were necessary precautions, naturally suggested by the experience of those evils to which the nation had been already exposed, in consequence of rais∣ing a foreign prince to the throne of England. As the Tories lay under the impu∣tation of favouring the late king's interest, they exerted themselves zealously on this occasion, to wipe off the aspersion, and insinuate themselves into the confidence of the people; hoping, that in the sequel they should be able to restrain the nation from engaging too deep in the affairs of the continent, without incurring the charge of disaffection to the present king and government. The act of set∣tlement being passed, the earl of Macclesfield was sent to notify the transaction

<P>The act of succession gave umbrage to all the popish princes who were more nearly related to the crown than this lady, whom the parliament had preferred to all others. The dutchess of Savoy, grand-daughter to king Charles I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by her mother, ordered her ambassador count Maffei, to make a protestation to the par∣liament of England, in her name, against all resolutions and decisions contrary to her title, as sole daughter to the princess Henrietta, next in succession to the crown of England, after king William and the princess Anne of Denmark. Two copies of this protest Maffei sent in letters to the lord-keeper and the speaker of the lower house, by two of his gentlemen and a public notary to attest the deli∣very; but, no notice was taken of the declaration. The duke of Savoy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> while his minister<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was thus employed in England, engaged in an alliance with the crowns of France and Spain, on condition, That his catholic majesty should espouse his youngest daughter without a dowry: That he himself should com∣mand the allied army in Italy, and furnish eight thousand infantry, with five and twenty hundred horse, in consideration of a monthly subsidy of fifty thou∣sand crowns.</P>

<P>During these transactions, Mr. Stanhope envoy extraordinary to the states-general, was empowered to treat with the ministers of France and Spain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> according to the addresses of both houses of parliament. He represented<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that though his most christian majesty had thought fit to deviate from the par∣tition<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>treaty, it was not reasonable that the king of England should lose the effect of that convention: he therefore expected some security for the peace of Europe; and for that purpose insisted upon certain articles, importing, That the French king should immediately withdraw his troops from the Spanish Ne∣therlands: That, for the security of England, the cities of Ostend and Newport should be delivered into the hands of his Britannic majesty: That no kingdom, provinces, cities, lands, or places belonging to the crown of Spain, should ever be yielded or transferred to the crown of France, on any pretence whatever: That the subjects of his Britannic majesty should retain all the privileges, rights, and immunities, with regard to their navigation and commerce in the dominions of Spain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they enjoyed at the death of his late catholic majesty: and also all such immunities, rights, and franchises, as the subjects of France or any other power, either possess for the present, or may enjoy for the future: That all treaties of peace and conventions between England and Spain should be re∣newed: and, That a treaty formed on these demands should be guara<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ied by such powers as one or other of the contractors should sollicit and prevail upon to accede. Such likewise were the proposals made by the states<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>general, with this difference, that they demanded as cautionary towns all the strongest places in the Netherlands. Count D'Avaux, the French minister, was so surprised at these exorbitant demands, that he could not help saying, They could not have been higher if his master had lost four successive battles. He assured them, that his most christian majesty would withdraw his troops from the Spanish Nether∣lands as soon as the king of Spain should have forces of his own sufficient to guard the country; but, with respect to the other articles, he could give no other answer, but that he would immediately transmit them to Versailles. Lewis was filled with indignation at the insolent strain of those proposals, which

He refused to give any oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r security for the peace of Europe, than a renewal of the treaty of Ryswick; and he is said to have tampered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by means of his agents and emissaries, with the members of the English parliament, that they might oppose all steps tending to a new war on the continent.</P>

<P>King William certainly had no expectation that France would close with such proposals; but, he was not without hope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that her refusal would warm the English nation into a concurrence with his designs. He communi∣cated to the house of commons the demands which had been made by him and the states-general; and gave them to understand, that he would from time to time make them acquainted with the progress of the negotiation. The com∣mons suspecting, that his intention was to make them parties in a congress which he might conduct to a different end from that which they proposed, resolved to signify their sentiments in the answer to this message. They called for the treaty of partition, which being read, they voted an address of thanks to his majesty for his gracious declaration, that he would make them acquainted with the progress of the negotiation; and they signified their disapprobation of the partition-tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, signed with the great seal of England, without the advice of the parliament which was then sitting, and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctive of ill consequences to the kingdom, as well as to the peace of Europe, as it assigned over to the French king such a large portion of the Spanish dominions. Nothing could be more mortifying to the king than this open attack upon his own conduct; yet he sup∣pressed his resentment, and without taking the least notice of their sentiments with respect to the partition-treaty, assured them, that he should be always ready to receive their advice on the negotiation which he had set on foot, ac∣cording to their desire. The debates in the house of commons upon the sub∣ject of the partition-treaty, rose to such violence, that divers members, in de∣claiming against it, transgressed the bounds of decency. Sir Edward Seymour compared the division which had been made of the Spanish territories, to a rob∣bery on the highway; and Mr. Howe did not scruple to say it was a felonious treaty: an expression, which the king resented to such a degree, that he de∣clared he would have demanded personal satisfaction with his sword, had not he been restrained by the disparity of condition between himself and the person who had offered such an outrageous insult to his honour. Whether the Tories in∣tended to alienate the minds of the nation from all foreign connexions, or to wreak their vengeance on the late ministers, whom they hated as the chiefs of the Whig party, certain it is, they now raised an universal outcry against the partition-treaty, which was not only condemned in public pamphlets and pri∣vate conversation, but even brought into the house of lords as an object of par∣liamentary censure. In the month of March a warm debate on this subject was begun by Sheffield marquis of Normanby, and carried on with great vehemence by other noblemen of the same faction. They exclaimed against the article by which so many territories were added to the crown of France: they complained, that the emperor had been forsaken: that the treaty was not communicated to the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vy-council or ministry, but clandestinely transacted by the earls of Port∣land and Jersey: and, that the sanction of the great seal had been unjustly and irregularly applied, first to blank powers, and afterwards to the treaty itself. The courtiers replied, that the king had engaged in a treaty of partition at the de∣sire
<PB N="215" REF="2180"/>
of the emperor, who had agreed to every article except that relating to the dutchy of Milan, and afterwards desired, that his majesty would procure for him the best terms he could obtain; above all things recommending secresy, that he might not forfeit his interest in Spain, by seeming to consent to the treaty: that foreign negotiations being intrusted to the care of the crown, the king lay under no legal obligation to communicate such secrets of state to his council; far less was he obliged to follow their advice: and, that the keeper of the great seal had no authority for refusing to apply it to any powers or treaty which the king should grant or conclude, unless they were contrary to law, which had made no provision for such an emergency<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this debate, the earl of Ro∣chester reprehended some lords for speaking dis∣respectfully of the French king, observing, that it was peculiarly incumbent on peers to treat monarchs with decorum and respect, as they de∣rived their dignity from the crown. Another affirming, that the French king was not only to be respected, but likewise to be feared; a certain lord replied, he hoped no man in England needed to be afraid of the French king, much less the peer who spoke last, who was too much a friend to that monarch to fear any thing from his re∣sentment.</NOTE>. The earl of Portland apprehend∣ing that this tempest would burst upon his head, declared, on the second day of the debate, that he had by the king's order communicated the treaty before it was concluded, to the earls of Pembroke and Marlborough, the lords Lonsdale, Somers, Hallifax, and secretary Vernon. These noblemen owned, that they had been made acquainted with the substance of it: that when they excepted to some particulars, they were told, his majesty had carried the matter as far as it could be advanced, and that he could obtain no better terms; thus assured that every article was already settled, they no longer insisted upon particulars, but gave their advice, that his majesty should not engage himself in any measure that would produce a new war, seeing the nation had been so uneasy under the last. After long debates, and great variety as well as virulence of altercation, they agreed to an address, in which they disapproved of the partition-treaty, as a scheme inconsistent with the peace and safety of Europe, as well as prejudicial to the interest of Great-Britain. They complained, that neither the instructions given to his plenipotentiaries, nor the draught of the treaty itself, had been laid before his majesty's council. They humbly besought him, that for the future, he would in all matters of importance, require, and admit the advice of his natural-born subjects of known probity and fortune: and, that he would constitute a council of such persons, to whom he might impart all affairs which should any way concern him and his dominions. They observed, that interest and natural affection to their country, would incline them to every measure that might tend to its welfare and prosperity; whereas strangers could<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Cole. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph. Voltaire.</NOTE> not be so much influenced by these considerations: that their knowledge of the country would render them more capable than foreigners could be, of advising his majesty touching the true interests of his kingdom: that they had exhibited such repeated demonstrations of their duty and affection, as must convince his majesty of their zeal in his service; nor could he want the knowledge of persons fit to be employed in all his secret and arduous affairs: finally, as the French king appeared to have violated the treaty of partition, they advised his majesty in future negotiations with that prince, to proceed with such caution as might imply a real security.</P>

Though he deeply felt this affront, he would not alter his conduct towards the new ministers; but, he plainly perceived their intention was to thwart him in his favourite measure, and humble him into a dependence upon their interest in<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1701.</NOTE> parliament. On the last day of March he imparted to the commons the French king's declaration, that he would grant no other security than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> renew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the treaty of Ryswick: so that the negotiation seemed to be at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> end. He like∣wise communicated two resolutions of the states-general, with a memorial from their envoy in England, relating to the ships they had equipped with a view to join the English <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet, and the succours stipulated in the treaty concluded in the year one thousand six hundred and seventy-seven, which they desired might be sent over with all convenient expedition. The house having considered this message, unanimously resolved, to desire his majesty would carry on the negotia∣tions in concert with the states-general, and take such measures therein as might most conduce to their safety; and, they assured him, they would effectually enable him to support the treaty of seventy-seven, by which England was bound to assist them with ten thousand men, and twenty ships of war, in case they should be attacked. Though the king was nettled at that part of this address, which, by confining him to one treaty, implied their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a new confe∣deracy, he discovered no signs of emotion; but, thanked them for the assur∣ance they had given, and told them he had sent orders to his envoy at the Hague, to continue the conferences with the courts of France and Spain. On the nine∣teenth day of April the marquis de Torcy delivered to the earl of Manchester at Paris, a letter, from the new king of Spain to his Britannic majesty, notifying his accession to that throne, and expressing a desire of cultivating a mutual friendship with the king and crown of England. How averse soever William might have been to any correspondence of this sort, the earl of Rochester and the new ministers importuned him in such a manner to acknowledge Philip, that he at length complied with their intreaties; and wrote a civil answer to his most catholic majesty. This was a very alarming incident to the emperor, who was bent upon a war with the two crowns, and had determined to send prince Eugene with an army into Italy, to take possession of the dutchy of Milan, as a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the empire. The new pope Clement XI. who had succeeded to the papacy in the preceding year, was attached to the French interest, while the Venetians favoured the emperor; but, they refused to declare themselves at this juncture.</P>

<P>The French king consented to a renewal of the negotiations at the Hague; but, in the mean time tampered with the Dutch deputies, to engage them in a separate treaty. Finding them determined to act in concert with the king of England, he protracted the conferences, in order to gain time, while he erected fortifications, and drew lines on the frontiers of Holland, divided the princes of the empire by his intrigues, and endeavoured to gain over the states of Italy. The Dutch, mean while, exerted themselves in providing for their own security. They reinforced their garri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, purchased supplies, and sollicited succours from foreign potentates. The states wrote a letter to king William,
<PB N="217" REF="2200"/>
explaining the danger of their situation, professing the most inviolable attach∣ment to the interest of England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and desiring<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the stipulated number of troops should be sent immediately to their assistance. The three Scottish regi∣ments which he had retained in his own pay, were immediately transported from Scotland. The letter of the states-general he communicated to the house of commons, who having taken it into consideration, resolved to assist his ma∣jesty to support his allies in maintaining the liberty of Europe; and to provide immediately succours for the states-general, according to the treaty of seventy∣seven. The house of peers, to whom the letter was also communicated, carried their zeal still farther. They presented an address, in which they desired his majesty would not only perform the articles of any former treaty with the states-general, but also engage with them in a strict league offensive and defensive, for their common preservation; and invite into it all the princes and states that were concerned in the present visible danger arising from the union of France and Spain. They exhorted him to enter into such alliances with the emperor, as his majesty should think necessary, pursuant to the ends of the treaty con∣cluded in the year one thousand six hundred and eighty-nine. They assured him of their hearty and sincere assistance, not doubting that almighty God would protect his sacred person in so righteous a cause; and, that the unani∣mity, wealth, and courage of his subjects would carry him with honour and success-through all the difficulties of a just war. Lastly, they took leave hum∣bly to represent, that the dangers to which his kingdom and allies had been exposed, were chiefly owing to the fatal counsels that prevented his majesty's sooner meeting his people in parliament.</P>

<P>These proceedings of both houses could not but be very agreeable to the king, who expressed his satisfaction in his answer to each apart. They were the more remarkable, as at this very time, considerable progress was made in a design to impeach the old ministry. This deviation, therefore, from the te∣nour of their former conduct, could be owing to no other motive than a sense of their own danger, and resentment against France, which, even during the nego∣tiation, had been secretly employed in making preparations to surprise and distress the states-general. The commons having expressed their sentiments on this sub∣ject, resumed the consideration of the partition-treaty. They had appointed a committee to examine the journals of the house of lords, and to report their proceedings in relation to the treaty of partition. When the report was made by Sir Edward Seymour, the house resolved itself into a committee, to consider the state of the nation; and, after warm debates, resolved, That William earl of Portland, by negotiating and concluding the treaty of partition, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour. They ordered Sir John Levison Gower to impeach him at the bar of the house of lords; and named a committee to prepare the articles of his impeachment. Then, in a conference with the lords, they desired to know the particulars of what had passed between the earl of Portland and secretary Vernon, in relation to the partition-treaty, as also what other information they had obtained concerning negotiations or treaties of par∣tition of the Spanish monarchy. The lords demurring to this demand, the lower house resolved to address the king, That copies of both treaties of par∣tition, together with all the powers and instructions for negotiating those trea∣ties, should be layed before them. The copies were accordingly produced, and
<PB N="218" REF="2210"/>
the lords sent down to the commons two papers, containing the powers granted to the earls of Portland and J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsey, for signing both treaties of partition. The house afterwards ordered, T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at Mr. secretary Vernon should lay before them all the letters which had passed between the earl of Portland and him, in relation to those treaties; and he thought proper to obey their command. Nothing could be m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>andalously partial than the conduct of the commons on this occasion. They resolved to skr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en the earl of Jersey, Sir Joseph Williamson, and Mr. Vernon, who had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en as deeply concerned as any others in that transaction; and pointed all their vengeance against the earls of Portland and Orford, the lords Somers and Hallifax. Some of the members even tampered with Kidd, who was now a prisoner in Newgate, to accuse lord Somers as having encou∣raged him in his pyracy. He was brought to the bar of the house and exa∣mined; but, he declared that he had never spoke to lord Somers; and, that he had no order from those concerned in the ship, but that of pursuing his voyage against the pyrates in Madagascar. Finding him unfit for their purpose, they left him to the course of law; and he, with some of his crew, were hanged.</P>

<P>Lord Somers understanding that he was accused in the house of com∣mons, of having consented to the partition-treaty, desired, that he might be admitted and heard in his own defence. His request being granted, he told the house, that when he received the king's letter concerning the partition-treaty, with an order to send over the necessary powers in the most secret man∣ner, he thought it would have been taking too much upon him to put a stop to a treaty of such consequence, when the life of the king of Spain was so preca∣rious; for, had that king died before the treaty was finished, and he been blamed for delaying the necessary powers, he could not have justified his own conduct, since the king's letter was really a warrant: that, nevertheless, he had written a letter to his majesty, objecting to several particulars in the treaty, and propos∣ing other articles which he thought were for the interest of his country: t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at he thought himself bound to put the great seal to the treaty when it was con∣cluded<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, as a privy-counsellor, he had offered his best advice, and as chancellor, executed his office according to his duty. After he had withdrawn, his justification gave rise to a long debate, which ended in a resolution carried by a majority of seven voices<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That John lord Somers, by advising his majesty to conclude the treaty of partition, whereby large territories of the Spanish monarchy were to be deliv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red up to France, was guilty of a high crime and misdemeanour. Votes to the same effect were passed against Edward ea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l of Orford, and Charles lord Hallifax; and all three were impeached at the bar of the upper house. But, the commons knowing, that those impeachments would produ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e nothing in the house of lords, where the opposite interest pre∣dominated, they resolved to proceed against the accused noblemen in a more expeditious and effectual way of branding their reputation. They voted and presented an address to the king, desiring he would remove them from his councils and presence for ever, as advisers of a treaty so pernicious to the trade and welfare of England. They concluded, by repeating their assurances, that they would always stand by and support his majesty to the utmost of their power, against all his enemies both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t home and abroad. The king, in his an∣swer, artfully overlooked the first part of the remonstrance. He thanked them for their repeated assurances; and, told them he would employ none in his ser∣vice
<PB N="219" REF="2220"/>
but such as should be thought mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t likely to improve that mutual trust and confidence between him an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his people, which was so necessary at that con∣juncture, both for their own s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>curity and the preservation of their allies.</P>

<P>The lords, incensed at this step of the commons, which they consi∣dered as an insult upon their t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ibunal, and a violation of common justice, drew up and delivered a counter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>address, humbly beseeching his majesty, that he would not pass any censure upon the accused lords, until they should be tried on the impeachm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nts, and judgment be given according to the usage of parlia∣ment. The king was so perplexed by these opposite representations, that he knew not well what course to follow. He made no reply to the counter-address<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but, allowed the names of the impeached lords to remain in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouncil-books. The commons having carried their point, which was to stigmatize those noble∣men, and prevent their being employed for the future, suffered the impeach∣ments to be neglected, until they themselves moved for trial. On the fifth day of May the hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of lords sent a message to the commons, importing, That no articles had as yet been exhibited against the noblemen whom they had im∣peached. The charge was immediately drawn up against the earl of Orford, whom they accused of having received exorbitant grants from the crown: of having been concerned with Kidd the pyrate: of having committed abuses in managing and victualling the fleet when it lay on the coast of Spain: and lastly, of having advised the partition-treaty. The earl in his own defence declared, that he had received no grant from the king, except a very distant reversion, and a present of ten thousand pounds after he had defeated the French at La Hogue: that in Kidd's affair he had acted legally, and with a good in∣tention towards the public, tho' to his own loss: that his accounts with regard to the fleet which he commanded, had been examined and passed; yet, he was ready to wave that advantage, and justify himself in every particular: and he absolutely denied, that he had given any advice concerning the treaty of par∣tition. Lord Somers was accused of having set the seals to the powers, and afterwards to the treaties: of having accepted some grants: of having been an accomplice with Kidd: and, of having been guilty of partial and dilatory pro∣ceedings in chancery. He answered every article of the charge; but, no repli∣cation was made by the commons, either to him or to the earl of Orford. When the commons were stimulated by another message from the peers, relating to the impeachments of the earl of Portland and lord Hallifax, they declined exhibiting articles against the former, on pretence of respect for his majesty; but, on the fourteenth of June the charge against Hallifax was sent up to the lords. He was taxed with possessing a grant in Ireland, without paying the produce of it, according to the law lately enacted concerning those grants: with enjoying another grant out of the forest of Dean, to the waste of the timber, and the prejudice of the navy: with having held places that were incompati∣ble, by being at the same time commissioner of the treasury, and chancellor of the exchequer: and, with having advised the two treaties of partition. He an∣swered, that his grant <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Ireland was of debts and sums of money, not within the act concerning confiscated estates: that all he had ever received from it, did not exceed four hundred pounds, which, if he was bound to repay, a common action would lie against him; but<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> every man was not to be impeached who did not discharge his debts at the very day of payment. He observed, that as
<PB N="220" REF="2230"/>
his grant in the forest of Dean extended to weedings only, it could occasion no waste of timber, nor prejudice to the navy: that the auditor's place was held by another person, until he obtained the king's leave to withdraw from the trea∣sury: that he never saw the first treaty of partition, nor was his advice asked upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the subject: that he had never heard of the second but once before it was co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded; and, then he spoke his sentiments freely on the subject. This an∣swer, like the others, would have been neglected by the commons, whose aim was now to evade the trials, had not the lords pressed them by messages to ex∣pedite the articles. They even appointed a day for Orford's trial, and signified their resolution to the commons, who desired that a committee of both houses should be named for settling preliminaries, one of which was, That the lord to be tried should not sit as a peer; and, the other imported, That those lords im∣peached for the same matter, should not vote in the trial of each other. They likewise desired, that lord Somers should be first tried. The lords made no objection to this last demand: but, they rejected the proposal of a committee consi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing of both houses, alledging, that the commons were parties, and had no title to sit in equality with the judges, or to settle matters relating to the trial: that this was a demand contrary to the principles of law and rules of ju∣stice, and never practised in any court or nation. The lords, indeed, had yielded to this expedient in the popish plot, because it was a case of treason, in which the king's life and safety of the kingdom were concerned, while the people were jealous of the court, and the whole nation was in a ferment: but, at present the times were quiet, and the charge amounted to nothing more than misdemea∣nours; therefore, the lords could not assent to such a proposal as was dero∣gatory from their jurisdiction. Neither would they agree to the preliminaries; but, on the twelfth day of June, resolved, That no peer impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should upon his trial be without the bar: and, That no peer impeached can be precluded from voting on any occasion, except in his own trial. Divers messages passed between the two houses; the commons still insisting upon a committee to settle preliminaries: at length, the dispute was brought to a free conference.</P>

<DIV4 N="53" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LIII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while, the king going to the house of peers, gave the royal assent to the bill of succession; and in his speech expressed his warm acknowledgments for their repeated assurances of supporting him in such alliances as should be most proper for the preservation of the li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rty of Europe, and for the security of England and the states-general. He observed, that the season of the year was ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anced: that the posture of affairs absolutely required his presence abroad: and, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e recommended dispatch of the public business, especially of those matters which were of the greatest importance. The commons thanked him in an address for having approved of their proceedings: declared they would support him in such alliances as he should think fit to make in conjunction with the emperor and the states-general, for the peace of Europe, and reducing the exorbitant power of France. Then they resumed their dispute with the upper house. In the free conference, lord Haver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am happened to tax the commons with partiality, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>npeaching some lords and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereening others, who were equally guilty of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame misdemeanours. Sir Christopher Mu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>grave and the managers for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ommons immediately withdrew; and, this unguarded fally being reported to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e house, they immediately resolved, That John lord Haver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am had uttered
<PB N="221" REF="2240"/>
most scandalous reproaches and false expressions, highly reflecting upon the ho∣nour and justice of the house of commons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tending to a breach in the good correspondence between the two houses, and to the interruption of the public justice of the nation: That the said lord Haversham should be charged before the lords for the said words: That the lords should be desired to proceed in justice against him, and to inflict upon him such punishment as so high <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n of∣fence against the commons did deserve. The commons had now found a pre∣tence to justify their delay; and declared they would not renew the conference until they should have received satisfaction. Lord Haversham offered to sub∣mit to a trial; but, insisted on their first proving the words which he was said to have spoken. When this declaration was imparted to the commons, they said<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the lords ought to have censured him in a summary way; and still re∣fused to renew the conference. The lords, on the other hand, came to a reso∣lution, That there should not be a committee of both houses concerning the trial of the impeached lords. Then they resolved, That lord Somers should be tried in Westminster hall on Tuesday the seventeenth day of June, and sig∣nified this resolution to the lower house; reminding them, at the same time, of the articles against the earl of Portland. The commons refused to appear, al∣ledging, they were the only judges, and, that the evidence was not yet pre∣pared. They sent up the reasons of their non-appearance to the house of lords, where they were supported by the new ministry and all the malcontents; and produced very warm debates. The majority carried their point piecemeal, by dint of different votes, against which very severe protests were entered. On the day appointed for the trial, they sent a message to the commons, that they were going to Westminster-hall. The other impeached lords asked leave, and were permitted to withdraw. The articles of impeachment against lord Somers, and his answers, being read in Westminster-hall, and the commons not appearing to prosecute, the lords adjourned to their own house, where they debated con∣cerning the question that was to be put. This being settled, they returned to Westminster-hall; and the question being put, <Q>“That John lord Somers be acquitted of the articles of impeachment against him, exhibited by the house of commons, and all things thereing contained: and, That the impeach∣ment be dismissed?”</Q> It was carried by a majority of thirty-five. The com∣mons, exasperated at these proceedings, resolved, That the lords had refused jus∣tice to the commons: That they had endeavoured to overturn the right of im∣peachments lodged in the commons by the antient constitution of the kingdom: and, That all the ill consequences which might attend the delay of the sup∣plies, given for the preservation of the public peace, and the maintenance of the balance of Europe, would be owing to those who, to procure an indem∣nity for their own crimes, had used their utmost endeavours to make a breach between the two houses. The lords sent a message to the commons, giving them to understand, that they had acquitted lord Somers, and dismissed the im∣peachment, as no body had appeared to support the articles: and, that they had appointed next Monday for the trial of the earl of Orford. They resolved, That unless the charge against lord Haversham should be prosecuted by the com∣mons before the end of the session, the lords would adjudge him innocent: That the resolutions of the commons in their late votes, contained most unjust reflections on the honour and justice of the peers: That they were contrived to
<PB N="222" REF="2250"/>
cover their affected and unreasonable delays in prosecuting the impeached lords: That they manifestly tended to the destruction of the judicature of the lords; to the rendering trials on impeachments impracticable for the future; and to the subverting the constitution of the English government: That, therefore, what∣ever ill consequences might arise from the so long deferring the supplies for this year's service, were to be attributed to the fatal counsel of the putting off the meeting of a parliament so long, and to the unnecessary delays of the house of commons. On the twenty-third day of June, the articles of impeachment ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t Edward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arl of Orford were read in Westminster-hall; but the house of commons having previously ordered that none of their members should appear at this pretended trial, those articles were not supported: so that his lordship was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cquitted, and the impeachment dismissed. Next day, the impeachment against the duke of Leeds, which had lain seven years neglected, together with those against the earl of Portland and lord Hallifax, as well as the charge against lord Haversham, were dismissed for want of prosecution. Each house ordered a narrative of those proceedings to be published; and their mutual animosity had proceeded to such a degree of rancour, as seemed to preclude all possibility of reconciliation. The commons, in the whole course of this transaction, had certainly acted from the motives of faction and revenge; for nothing could be more unjust, frivolous, and partial, than the charge exhibited in the articles of impeachment, their anticipating address to the king, and their affected delay in the prosecutions. Their conduct on this occasion was so flagrant as to attract the notice of the common people, and inspire the generality of the nation with disgust. This the Whigs did not fail to augment by the arts of calumny, and, in particular, by insinuating that the court of Versailles had found means to engage the majority of the commons in its interest.</P>

<P>These had, since the beginning of this session, employed their emis∣saries in exciting a popular aversion to the Tory ministers and members, and succeeded so well in their endeavours, that they formed a scheme of obtaining petitions from different counties and corporations, that should induce the com∣mons to alter their conduct, on the supposition that it was contrary to the sense of the nation. In execution of this scheme, a petition, signed by the deputy∣lieutenants, above twenty justices of the peace, the grand jury and freeholders of the county of Kent, had been presented to the house of commons on the eighteenth day of May, by five gentlemen of fortune and distinction. The purport of this remonstrance was, to recommend union among themselves, and confidence in his majesty, whose great actions for the nation could never be forgot without the blackest ingratitude: to beg they would have regard to the voice of the people; that their religion and safety might be effectually pro∣vided for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that their loyal addresses might be turned into bills of supply; and that his most sacred majesty might be enabled powerfully to assist his allies before it should be too late. The house was so incensed at the petulance of the petition, that they voted it scandalous, insolent, and seditious; and or∣dered the gentlemen who had presented it to be taken into custody. They were afterwards committed to the Gate-house, where they remained till the prorogation of parliament: but they had no reason to repine at their imprison∣ment, which recommended them to the notice and esteem of the public. They were visited and caressed by the chiefs of the Whig-interest, and considered as mar∣tyrs
<PB N="223" REF="2260"/>
to the liberties of the people. Their confinement gave rise to a very ex∣traordinary paper, intitled, <Q>“A Memorial from the gentlemen, freeholders, and inhabitants, of the counties of—, in behalf of themselves, and many thousands of the good people of England.”</Q> It was signed Legion, and sent to the speaker in a letter, commanding him, in the name of two hundred thousand Englishmen, to deliver it to the house of commons. In this strange expostulation, the house was charged with illegal and unwarrantable practices, in fifteen particulars; a new claim of right was ranged under seven heads; and the commons were admonished to act according to their duty, as specified in this memorial, on pain of incurring the resentment of an injured nation. It was concluded in these words: <Q>“For Englishmen are no more to be slaves to par∣liaments than to kings; our name is Legion, and we are many.”</Q> The commons were equally provoked and intimidated by this libel, which was the production of one Daniel de Foe, a scurrilous party-writer, in very little esti∣mation. They would not, however, deign to take notice of it in the house; but a complaint being made of endeavours to raise tumults and seditions, a committee was appointed to draw up an address to his majesty, informing him of those seditious endeavours, and beseeching him to provide for the public peace and security.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="55" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LV.</HEAD>
<P>The house, however, perceiving plainly that they had incurred the odium of the nation, which began to clamour for a war with France, and dreading the popular resentment, thought fit to change their measures with re∣spect to this object, and present the address we have already mentioned, in which they promised to support him in the alliances he should contract with the emperor and other states, in order to bridle the exorbitant power of France. They likewise proceeded in earnest upon the supply, and voted funds for raising about two millions seven hundred thousand pounds, to defray the expence of the ensuing year. They voted thirty thousand seamen, and resolved that ten thousand troops should be transported from Ireland to Holland, as the auxi∣liaries stipulated in the treaty of seventy-seven with the states-general. The funds were constituted of a land-tax, certain duties on merchandise, and a weekly deduction from the excise, so as to bring down the civil list to six hun∣dred thousand pounds; as the duke of Gloucester was dead, and James's queen refused her allowance. They passed a bill for taking away all privilege of par∣liament in legal prosecutions, during the intermediate prorogations; and their last struggle with the lords was concerning a bill for appointing commissioners to examine and state the public accounts. The persons nominated for this purpose were extremely obnoxious to the majority of the peers, as violent partisans of the Tory faction; when the bill therefore was sent up to the lords, they made some amendments which the commons rejected. The former ani∣mosity between the two houses began to revive, when the king interrupted their disputes by putting an end to the session, on the twenty-fourth day of June, after having thanked the parliament for their zeal in the public service, and exhorted them to a discharge of their duties in their several counties. He was no doubt extremely pleased with such an issue of a session that had begun with a very inauspicious aspect. His health daily declined; but he con∣cealed the decay of his constitution, that his allies might not be discouraged from engaging in a confederacy of which he was deemed the head and chief
<PB N="224" REF="2270"/>
support. He conferred the command of the ten thousand troops destined for Holland upon the earl of Marlborough, and appointed him at the same time his plenipotentiary to the states-general; a choice that evinced his discernment and discretion; for that nobleman surpassed all his cotemporaries, both as a general and a politician. He was cool, penetrating, intrepid, and persevering, plau<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ible, insinuating, artful, and dissembling.</P>

<P>A regency being established, the king embarked for Holland in the beginning of July; and, on his arrival at the Hague, assisted at an assembly of the states-general, whom he harrangued in very affectionate terms, and was answered with great cordiality: then he made a progress round the frontiers, to examine the state of the garrisons; and gave such orders and directions as he judged necessary for the defence of the country. Mean while, the French minister D'Avaux being recalled from the Hague, delivered a letter to the states from the French king, who complained that they had often interrupted the conferences, from which no good fruits were to be expected: but he assured them it wholly depended upon themselves, whether they should continue to re∣ceive marks of his antient friendship for their republic. This letter was ac∣companied by an insolent memorial, to which the states-general returned a very spirited answer. As they expected nothing now but hostilities from France, they redoubled their diligence in making preparations for their own defence. They repaired their fortifications, augmented their army, and hired auxiliaries. King William and they had already engaged in an alliance with the king of Denmark, who undertook to furnish a certain number of troops, in consideration of a subsidy; and they endeavoured to mediate a peace between Sweden and Poland; but this they could not effect. France had likewise offered her mediation between those powers, in hope of bringing over Sweden to her interest; and the court of Vienna had tampered with the king of Poland; but he persisted in his re∣solution to prosecute the war. The Spaniards began to be very uneasy under the dominion of their new master. They were shocked at the insolence of his French ministers and attendants, and much more at the manners and fashions which they introduced. The grandees found themselves very little considered by their sovereign, and resented his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>economy; for he had endeavoured to re∣trench the expence of the court, which had used to support their magnificence. Prince Eugene, at the head of the Imperial army, had entered Italy by Vi∣cenza, and passed the Adige near Carpi, where he defeated a body of five thousand French forces. The enemy were commanded by the duke of Savoy, assisted by marechal Catinat and the prince of Vaudemont, who did not think proper to hazard an engagement. But marechal Villeroy arriving in the latter end of August, with orders to attack the Imperialists, Catinat retired in disgust. The new general marched immediately towards Chiari, where prince Eugene was in∣tre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched, and attacked his camp, but met with such a reception that he was obliged to retire with the loss of five thousand men. Towards the end of the campaign, the prince took possession of all the Mantuan territories, except Mantua itself, and Goits, the blockade of which he formed. He reduced all the places on the Ogli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and continued in the field during the whole winter, exhibiting repeated marks of the most invincible courage, indefatigable vigilance, and extensive capacity in the art of war. In January he had well nigh surprised Cremona, by introducing a body of men through an old aqueduct. They forced one of the
<PB N="225" REF="2280"/>
gates, by which the prince and his followers entered: Villeroy being wakened by the noise, ran out into the street, where he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> taken<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the town must have been infallibly reduced, had prince Eugene been joined by another body of troops which he had ordered to march from the Parmesan and secure the bridge. These not arriving at the time appointed, an Irish regiment in the French service took possession of the bridge, and the prince was obliged to retire with his prisoner.</P>

<HEAD>§ LVII.</HEAD>
<P>The French king, alarmed at the activity and military genius of the Imperial general, sent a reinforcement to his army in Italy, and the duke of Vendome to command his forces in that country: he likewise importuned the duke of Savoy to assist him effectually; but that prince having obtained all he could expect from France, became cold and backward. His second daughter was by this time married to the new king of Spain, who met her at Barcelona, where he found himself involved in disputes with the states of Catalonia, who refused to pay a tax he had imposed, until their privileges should be confirmed; and he was obliged to gratify them in this particular. The war continued to rage in the North. The young king of Sweden routed the Saxons upon the river Danu; thence he marched into Courland, and took possession of Mit∣tau without opposition; while the king of Poland retired into Lithuania. In Hungary the French emissaries endeavoured to sow the seeds of a new revolt. They exerted themselves with indefatigable industry in almost every court of Christendom. They had already gained over the elector of Bavaria, and his brother the elector of Cologne, together with the dukes of Wolfembuttle and Saxe-Gotha, who professed neutrality while they levied troops, and made such preparations for war as plainly indicated that they had received subsidies from France. Lewis had also extorted a treaty of alliance from the king of Portugal, who was personally attached to the Austrian interest: but this weak prince was a slave to his ministers, whom the French king had corrupted. During this summer, the French coasts were overawed by the combined fleets of England and Holland, under the command of Sir George Rooke, who sailed down the channel in the latter end of August, and detached vice-admiral Benbow with a strong squadron to the West Indies. In order to deceive the French king with regard to the destination of this fleet, king William demanded the free use of the Spanish harbours, as if his design had been to send a squadron to the Mediterranean; but he met with a repulse, while the French ships were freely admitted. About this period the king revoked his letters-patent to the commissioners of the admiralty, and constituted the earl of Pembroke lord-high-admiral of England, in order to avoid the factions, the disputes, and di∣vided counsels of a board. The earl was no sooner promoted to this office, than he sent captain Loades with three frigates to Cadiz, to bring home the sea-stores and effects belonging to the English in that place, before the war should commence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and this piece of service was successfully performed. The French king, in order to enjoy all the advantages that could be derived from his union with Spain, established a company to open a trade with Mexico and Peru; and concluded a new assiento treaty for supplying the Spanish planta∣tions with negroes. At the same time he sent a strong squ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dron to the port of Cadiz. The French dress was introduced into the court of Spain; and, by a formal edict, the grandees of that kingdom and the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers of France were put
<PB N="226" REF="2290"/>
on a level in each nation. There was no vigour left in the councils of Spain: her finances were exhausted; her former spirit seerned to be quite extin∣guished: the nobility were beggars, and the common people overwhelmed with i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>digence and distress. The condition of France was not much more prospero<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. She had been harrassed by a long war, and now saw herself on the eve of another, which in all probability would render her completely miserable.</P>

<DIV4 N="58" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ LVIII.</HEAD>
<P>These circumstances were well known to the emperor and the mari∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me powers, and served to animate their negotiations for another grand alliance. Conferences were opened at the Hague; and, on the seventh day of Septem∣ber, a treaty was concluded between his Imperial majesty, England, and the states-general. The objects proposed, were to procure satisfaction to the em∣peror in the Spanish succession, and sufficient security for the dominions and commerce of the allies.

They agreed that the king of England and the states-general should keep and possess whatever lands and cities they could conquer from the Spaniards in the Indies: That the confederates should faithfully communicate their designs to one an∣other: That no party should treat of peace, or truce, but jointly with the rest: That they should concur in preventing the union of France and Spain under the same government; and hinder the French from possessing the Spanish Indies: That, in concluding a peace, the confederates should provide for the maintenance of the commerce carried on by the maritime powers to the dominions taken from the Spaniards, and secure the states by a barrier: That they should at the same time settle the exercise of religion in the new conquests: That they should as∣sist one another with all their forces, in case of being invaded by the French king, or any other potentate, on account of this alliance: That a defensive alliance should remain between them even after the peace: That all kings, princes, and states, should be at liberty to engage in this alliance. They de∣termined to employ two months, to obtain, by amicable means, the satisfaction and security which they demanded; and stipulated, that within six weeks the treaty should be ratified.</P>

<P>On the sixteenth day of September, king James expired at St. Ger∣main's, after having laboured under a tedious indisposition. This unfortunate monarch, since the miscarriage of his last attempt for recovering his throne, had laid aside all thoughts of worldly grandeur, and devoted his whole attention to the concerns of his soul. Though he could not prevent the busy genius of his queen from planning new schemes of restoration, he was always best pleased when wholly detached from such chimerical projects. Hunting was his chief diversion; but religion was his constant care. Nothing could be more harm∣less than the life he led; and, in the course of it, he subjected himself to un∣common penance and mortification. He frequently visited the poor monks of La Trappe, who were much edified by his humble and pious deportment. His pride and arbitrary temper seem to have vanished with his greatness. He became affable, kind and easy to all his dependents; and his religion certainly opened and improved the virtues of his heart, though it seemed to impair the
<PB N="227" REF="2300"/>
faculties of his soul. In his last illness he conjured his son to prefer his religion to every worldly advantage, and even to renounce all thoughts of a crown, if he could not enjoy it without offering violence to his fai h. He recommended to him the practice of justice and christian forgiveness; he himself declaring<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that he heartily forgave the prince of Orange, the emperor, and all his ene∣mies. He died with great marks of devotion, and was interred, at his own re∣quest, in the church of the English Benedictines in Paris, without any funeral solemnity.</P>

<P>Before his death he was visited by the French king, who seemed touched with his condition, and declared, that in case of his death, he would own his son as king of England. This promise James's queen had already extorted from him, by the interest of madam de Maintenon and the dauphin. Accordingly, when James died, the pretended prince of Wales was proclaimed king of England at St. Germain's, and treated as such at the court of Ver∣sailles. His title was likewise recognized by the king of Spain, the duke of Savoy, and the pope. William was no sooner informed of this transaction, than he dispatched a courier to the king of Sweden, as guarantee of the treaty of Ryswick, to complain of this manifest violation. At the same time, he re∣called the earl of Manchester from Paris, and ordered him to return without taking an audience of leave. That nobleman immediately withdrew, after having intimated to the marquis de Torcy the order he had received. Lewis, in vindication of his own conduct, dispersed through all the courts of Europe, a manifesto, in which he affirmed, that in owning the prince of Wales as king of England, he had not infringed any article of the treaty of Ryswick. He confessed, that in the fourth article, he had promised that he would not disturb the king of Great Britain in the peaceable possession of his dominions; and he declared his intention was to observe that promise punctually. He observed, that his generosity would not allow him to abandon the prince of Wales or his family: that he could not refuse him a title which was due to him by birth: that he had more reason to complain of the king of Great Britain, and the states-general, whose declarations and preparations in favour of the emperor might be regarded as real contraventions to treaties: finally, he quoted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome instances from history, in which the children enjoyed the titles of kingdoms which their fathers had lost. These reasons, however, would hardly have induced the French king to take such a step, had not he perceived that a war with Eng∣land was inevitable; and that he should be able to reap some advantages in the course of it, from espousing the cause of the pretender.</P>

<P>The substance of the French manifesto was published in London by Poussin the secretary of Tallard, who had been left in England, as agent for the court of Versailles. He was now ordered to leave the kingdom, which was filled with indignation at Lewis, for having pretended to declare who ought to be their sovereign. The city of London presented an address to the lords-justices, expressing the deepest resentment of the French king's presumption; and assuring his majesty, that they would at all times exert the utmost of their abilities for the preservation of his person, and the defence of his just rights, in opposition to all invaders of his crown and dignity. Addresses of the same nature were sent up from all parts of the kingdom, and could not but be agree∣able to William. He had now concerted measures for acting with vigour
<PB N="228" REF="2310"/>
against France, and resolved to revisit his kingdom, after having made con∣siderable progress in a treaty of perpetual alliance between England and the states-general, which was afterwards brought to perfection by his plenipotien∣tiary the earl of Marlborough. The king's return, however, was delayed a whole month by a severe indisposition, during which the Spanish minister De Quiros hired certain physicians to consult together upon the state and nature of his distemper. They declared that he could not outlive many weeks; and this opinion was transmitted to Madrid. William, however, baffled the prognostic, though his constitution had sustained such a rude shock, that he himself per∣ceived his end was near. He told the earl of Portland, he found himself so weak that he could not expect to live another summer; but charged him to conceal this circumstance until he should be dead. Notwithstanding this near approach to dissolution, he exerted himself with surprising diligence and spirit in establishing the confederacy, and settling the plan of operations. A sub∣sidiary treaty was concluded with the king of Prussia, who engaged to furnish a certain number of troops. The emperor agreed to maintain ninety thousand men in the field to act against France: the proportion of the states was limited to one hundred and two thousand; and that of England did not exceed forty thousand, to act in conjunction with the allies.</P>

<P>On the fourth day of November the king arrived in England, which he found in a strange ferment, produced from the mutual animosity of the two factions. They reviled each other in words and writing with all the falshood of calumny, and all the bitterness of rancour; so that truth, candour, and temperance, seemed to be banished by consent of both parties. The king had found himself deceived in his new ministers, who had opposed his mea∣sures with all their influence. He was particularly disgusted with the de∣portment of the earl of Rochester, who proved altogether imperious and un∣tractable; and, instead of moderating, inflamed the violence of his party. The king declared, the year in which that nobleman directed his councils, was the uneasiest of his whole life. He could not help expressing his displeasure in such a coldness of reserve, that Rochester told him he would serve his ma∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esty no longer, since he did not enjoy his confidence. William made no answer to this expostulation, but resolved he should see him no more. The earl, however, at the desire of Mr. Harley, became more pliant and submissive; and, after the king's departure for Holland, repaired to his government of Ireland, in which he now remained, exerting all his endeavours to acquire popularity. William foreseeing nothing but opposition from the present spirit of the house of commons, closetted some of their leaders, with a view to be∣speak their compliance: but finding them determined to pursue their former principles, and to insist upon their impeachments, he resolved, with the ad∣vice of his friends, to dissolve the parliament. This step he was the more easily induced to take, as the commons were become extremely odious to the na∣tion in general, which breathed nothing but war and defiance against the French monarch. The parliament was accordingly dissolved by proclamation, and an∣other summoned to meet on the thirtieth day of December.</P>

<P>Never did the two parties proceed with such heat and violence against each other, as in their endeavours to influence the new elections. The Whigs, however, obtained the victory, as they included the monied-interest,
<PB N="229" REF="2320"/>
which will always prevail among the borough-electors. Corruption was now reduced into an open and avowed commerce; and, had not the people been so universally venal and profligate, that no sense of shame remained, the victors must have blushed for their success. Though the majority thus obtained was staunch to the measures of the court, the choice of speaker fell upon Mr. Har∣ley, contrary to the inclination of the king, who favoured Sir Thomas Lyttle∣ton: but his majesty's speech was received with universal applause. It was so much admired by the well-wishers to the revolution, that they printed it with decorations, in the English, Dutch, and French languages. It appeared as a piece of furniture in all their houses, and as the king's last legacy to his own and all protestant people. In this celebrated harrangue, he expatiated upon the indignity offered to the nation by the French king's acknowledging the pretended prince of Wales: he explained the dangers to which it was exposed, by his placing his grandson on the throne of Spain: he gave them to under∣stand he had concluded several alliances, according to the encouragement given him by both houses of parliament, which alliances should be layed before them, together with other treaties still depending. He observed, that the eyes of all Europe were upon this parliament; and all matters at a stand, until their resolution should be known: therefore no time ought to be lost. He told them they had yet an opportunity to secure for themselves and their posterity the quiet enjoyment of their religion and liberties, if they were not wanting to themselves, but would exert the antient vigour of the English na∣tion: but he declared his opinion was, that should they neglect this occasion, they had no reason to hope for another. He said it would be necessary to maintain a great strength at sea, and a force at land, proportionable to that of their al∣lies. He pressed the commons to support the public credit, which could not be preserved without keeping sacred that maxim, That they shall never be losers who trust to a parliamentary security. He declared, that he never asked aids from his people without regret; that what he desired was for their own safety and honour, at such a critical time; and that the whole should be appropriated to the purposes for which it was intended. He expressed his willingness that the accounts should be yearly submitted to the inspection of parliament. He again recommended dispatch, together with good bills for employing the poor, encouraging trade, and suppressing vice. He expressed his hope that they were come together determined to avoid disputes and differences, and to act with a hearty concurrence for promoting the common cause. He said he should think it as great a blessing as could befal England, if they were as much inclined to lay aside those unhappy fatal animosities which divided and weakened them, as he was disposed to make all his subjects safe and easy, as to any, even the highest offences committed against his person. He conjured them to dis∣appoint the hopes of their enemies by their unanimity. As he had always shewn, and always would shew<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how desirous he was to be the common father of all his people, he desired they would lay aside parties and divisions, so as that no distinc∣tions should be heard of amongst them, but of those who were friends to the protestant religion and present establishment, and of those who wished for a popish prince and a French government. He concluded by affirming, that if they, in good earnest, desired to see England hold the balance of Europe, and be indeed at the head of the protestant interest, it would appea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by their improving the present opportunity. The lords immediately drew up a warm and affectionate
<PB N="230" REF="2330"/>
address, in which they expressed their resentment of the proceedings of the French king, in owning the pretended prince of Wales for king of England. They assured his majesty they would assist him to the utmost of their power against all his enemies; and, when it should please God to deprive them of his majesty's protection, they would vigorously assist and defend against the pretended prince of Wales, and all other pretenders whatsoever, every person and persons who had right to succeed to the crown of England, by virtue of the acts of parliament for establishing and limiting the succession. On the fifth day of January, an address to the same effect was presented by the com∣mons, and both met with a very gracious reception from his majesty. The lords, as a further proof of their zeal, having taken into consideration the dan∣gers that threatened Europe, from the accession of the duke of Anjou to the crown of Spain, drew up another address, explaining their sense of that dan∣ger; stigmatising the French king as a violator of treaties; declaring their opinion, that his majesty, his subjects, and allies, could never be safe and se∣cure, until the house of Austria should be restored to their rights, and the in∣vader of the Spanish monarchy brought to reason; and assuring his majesty that no time should be lost, nor any thing wanting on their parts, which might answer the reasonable expectations of their friends abroad; not doubting but to support the reputation of the English name, when engaged under so great a prince, in the glorious cause of maintaining the liberty of Europe.</P>

<P>The king, in order to acquire the confidence of the commons, ordered Mr. secretary Ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to lay before them, copies of the treaties and conventions he had lately concluded, which were so well approved that the house unanimously voted the supply. By another vote, they authorised the exchequer to borrow six hundred thousand pounds at six per cent. for the service of the fleet, and fifty thousand pounds for the subsistence of guards and garrisons. They deliberated upon the state of the navy, with the debt due upon it, and examined an estimate of what would be necessary for extraordi∣nary repairs. They called for an account of that part of the national debt for which no provision had been made. They ordered the speaker to write to the trustees for the forfeited estates in Ireland, to attend the house with a full detail of their proceedings in the execution of that act of parliament. On the ninth day of January, they unanimously resolved, That leave be given to bring in a bill for securing his majesty's person, and the succession of the crown in the protestant line, for extinguishing the hopes of the pretended prince of Wales, and all other pretenders, and their open and secret abettors. They resolved to address his majesty, that he would insert an article in all his treaties of alliance, importing, That no peace should be made with France, until his majesty and the nation have reparation for the great indignity offered by the French king, in owning and declaring the pretended prince of Wales king of England, Scot∣land, and Ireland. They agreed to maintain forty thousand men for the sea∣service, and a like number by land, to act in conjunction with the forces of the allies, according to the proportions settled by the contracting powers. The supplies were raised by an imposition of four shillings in the pound upon lands, annuities, pensions, and stipends, and on the profits arising from the different professions: by a tax of two and one half per cent. on all stock in trade, and money at interest; of five shillings in the pound on all salaries, fees, and per∣quisites; a capitation tax of four shillings; an imposition of one per cent. on
<PB N="231" REF="2340"/>
all shares in the capital stock of any corporation or company which should be bought, sold, or bargained for: a duty of sixpence per bushel on malt, and a further duty on mum, cyder, and perry.</P>

<P>The commons seemed to vie with the lords in their zeal for the go∣vernment. They brought in a bill for attainting the pretended prince of Wales, which being sent up to the other house, passed with an additional clause of attainder against the queen, who acted as regent for the pretender. This, however, was not carried without great opposition in the house of lords. When the bill was sent back to the commons, they excepted to the amendment as ir∣regular. They observed, that attainders by bill constituted the most rigorous part of the law; and, that the stretching of it ought to be avoided. They pro∣posed, that the queen should be attainted by a separate bill. The lords assented to the proposal: the bill against the pretended prince of Wales passed. The lords passed another for attainting the queen; however, it was neglected in the house of commons. But, the longest and warmest debates of this session were produced by a bill, which the lords brought in for abjuring the pretended prince of Wales, and swearing to the king, by title of Rightful and lawful king, and his heirs, according to the act of settlement. It was proposed, that this oath should be voluntary, tendered to all persons, and their subscription or re∣fusal recorded, without any other penalty. This article was violently opposed by the earl of Nottingham, and other lords of the Tory-interest. They observed, that the government was first settled with another oath, which was like an ori∣ginal contract; so that there was no occasion for a new imposition: that oaths relating to men's opinions had been always considered as severe impositions: and, that a voluntary oath was in its own nature unlawful. During these dis∣putes, another bill of abjuration was brought into the house of commons by Sir Charles Hedges, that should be obligatory on all persons who enjoyed em∣ployments in church or state; it likewise included an obligation to maintain the government, in king, lords, and commons, and to maintain the church of Eng∣land, together with the toleration for dissenters. Warm debates arose upon the question, Whether the oath should be imposed or voluntary? and at length, it was carried for imposition, by the majority of one voice. They agreed to insert an additional clause, declaring it equally penal to compass or imagine the death of her royal highness the princess Anne of Denmark, as it was to compass or ima∣gine the death of the king's eldest son and heir. In the house of peers this bill was strenuously opposed by the Tories; and, when after long debates it passed on the twenty-fourth day of February, ten lords entered a protest against it as an unnecessary and severe imposition.</P>

<P>The whole nation now seemed to join in the cry for a war with France. Party-heats began to abate; the factions in the city of London were in a great measure moderated by the union of the two companies trading to the East-Indies, which found their mutual interest required a coalition. The To∣ries in the house of commons having concurred so heartily with the inclinations of the people, resolved, as far as it lay in their power, to justify the conduct of their party in the preceding parliament. They complained of some petitions and addresses which had reflected upon the proceedings of the last house of commons, and particularly, of the Kentish petition. The majority, however, determined, that it was the undoubted right of the people of England, to pe∣tition
<PB N="232" REF="2350"/>
or address to the king, for the calling, sitting, or dissolving of parliaments, and for the redressing of g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>evances; and, that every subject under any accusation, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther by impeachment or otherwise, had a right to be brought to a speedy trial. A complaint be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng likewise made, that the lords had denied the commons <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ice in the matter of the late impeachments, a furious debate ensued; and it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as carried by a very small majority, that justice had not been denied. In some <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> however, the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> succeeded. In the case of a controverted election at Mai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one, between Thomas B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sse and Thomas Culpepper, the house resolved, That the latter had been not only guilty of corrupt, scandalous, and indirect practices, in endeavouring to procure himself to be elected a burgess, but like∣wise, being one of the instruments in promoting and presenting the scanda∣ious, insolent, and seditious petition, commonly called the Kentish petition, to the last house of commons, was guilty of promoting a scandalous, villanous, and groundless reflection upon that house, by aspersing the members with receiving French money, or being in the interest of France; for which offence he was ordered to be committed to Newgate, and to be prosecuted by his majesty's attorney-general. They also resolved, That to assert that the house of com∣mons is not the only representative of the commons of England, tends to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubversion of the rights and privileges of the house of commons, and the fun∣damental constitution of the government of this kingdom: That to assert, that the house of commons have no power of commitment, but of their own mem∣bers, tends to the subversion of the constitution of the house of commons: That to print or publish any books, or libels, reflecting upon the proceedings of the house of commons, or any member thereof, for, or relating to his service therein, is a high violation of the rights and privileges of the house of com∣mons. Notwithstanding these transactions, they did not neglect the vigorous prosecution of the war. They addressed his majesty to interpose with his allies, that they might increase their quotas of land<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>forces, to be put on board the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet in proportion to the numbers his majesty should embark. When they had settled the sums appropriated to the several uses of the war, they presented a second address, desiring he would provide for the half-pay officers in the first place, in the recruits and levies to be made. The king assured them, it was always his intention to provide for those officers. He went to the house of peers, and gave the royal assent to an act, appointing commissioners to take, examine, and determine the debts due to the army, navy, and the transport∣service; and also an account of prizes taken during the war.</P>

<P>The affairs of Ireland were not a little embarrassed by the conduct of the trustees appointed to take cognizance of the forfeited estates. Their office was extremely odious to the people, as well as to the court, and their de∣portment was arbitrary and imperious. Several individuals of that king∣dom, provoked by the insolence of the trustees on one hand, and encouraged by the countenance of the courtiers on the other, endeavoured by a circular letter, to spirit up the grand-jury of Ireland against the act of resumption; and petitions were presented to the king, couched in very strong terms, affirm∣ing, that it was injurious to the protestant interest, and had been obtained by gross misinformations. The king having communicated these addresses to the house, they were immediately voted scandalous, false, and groundless; and the com∣mons resolved, That notwithstanding the complaints and clamours against the
<PB N="233" REF="2360"/>
trustees, it did not appear to the house but those complaints were groundless; nevertheless, they afterwards received several petitions, imploring relief against the said act; and they ordered that the petitioners should be relieved accordingly. Proposals were delivered in for incorporating such as should purchase the said forfeitures, on certain terms therein specified, according to the rent-roll, when verified and made good to the purchasers; but, whereas in this rent-roll the valu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the estates had been estimated at something more than seven hundred and sixteen thousand pounds, those who undertook to make the purchase, af∣firmed, they were not worth five hundred thousand pounds: and thus the affair remained in suspense.</P>

<P>With respect to Scotland, the clamours of that kingdom had not yet subsided. When the bill of abjuration passed in the house of peers, the earl of Nottingham had declared, that although he differed in opinion from the majority in many particulars relating to that bill, yet he was a friend to the de∣sign of it; and, in order to secure a protestant succession, he thought an union of the whole island was absolutely necessary. He therefore moved for an address to the king, that he would dissolve the parliament of Scotland now sitting, as the legality of it might be called in question, on account of its having been origi∣nally a convention; and, that a new parliam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt should be summoned, that they might treat about an union of the two kingdoms. The king had this affair so much at heart, that even when he was disabled from going to the parlia∣ment in person, he sent a letter to the commons, expressing an eager desire that a treaty for this purpose might be set on foot, and earnestly recommended this affair to the consideration of the house. But, as a new parliament in Scotland could not be called without a great risque, while the nation was in such a fer∣ment, the project was postponed to a more favourable opportunity.</P>

<P>Before the king's return from Holland, he had concerted with his allies the operations of the ensuing campaign. He had engaged in a ne∣gotiation with the prince of Hesse-D'Armstadt, who assured him, that if he would besiege and take Cadiz, the admiral of Castile and divers other grandees of Spain, would declare for the house of Austria. The allies had also determined upon the siege of Key<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erswaert, which the elector of Cologne had delivered into the hands of the French: the elector of Hanover had resolved to disarm the princes of Wolfembuttle: the king of the Romans and prince Lewis of Baden, undertook to invest Landau; and the emperor promised to send a powerful rein∣forcement to prince Eugene in Italy; but, William did not live to see these schemes put in execution. His constitution was by this time almost exhausted, tho' he endea∣voured to conceal the effects of his malady, and to repair his health by exercise. On the twenty-first day of February, in riding to Hampton-court from Kensington, his horse fell under him, and he himself was thrown upon the ground with such violence, as produced a fracture in his collar bone. His attendants conveyed him to the palace of Hampton-court, where the fracture was reduced by Ronjat his serjeant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>surgeon. In the evening he returned to Kensington in his coach, and the two ends of the fractured bone having been disunited by the jolting of the carriage, were replaced under the inspection of Bidloo his physician. He seemed to be in a fair way of recovering till the first day of March, when his knee seemed to be inflamed, with great pain and weakness. Next day he granted a commission under the great seal to several peers, for passing the bills to which

<P>On the fourth day of March the king was so well recovered of his lameness, that he took several turns in the gallery at Kensington; but, sitting down on a couch where he fe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l asleep, he was seized with a shivering, which terminated in a fever and diarrhoea. He was attended by Sir Thomas Milling∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, Sir Richard Blackmore, Sir Theodore Colledon, Dr. Bidloo, and other eminent physicians; but, their prescriptions proved ineffectual. On the sixth he granted another commission for passing the bill for the malt-tax, and the act of abjuration: and, being so weak that he could not write his name, he, in presence of the lord-keeper and the clerks of parliament, applied a stamp pre∣pared for the purpose. The earl of Albemarle arriving from Holland, confer∣red with him in private on the posture of affairs abroad; but, he received his infor∣mations with great coldness, and said, "Je <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire vers ma fin." <Q>“I approach the end of life.”</Q> In the evening he thanked Dr. Bidloo for his care and tenderness, saying, <Q>“I know that you and the other learned physicians have done all that your art can do for my relief; but, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding all means ineffectual, I submit.”</Q> He received spiritual consolation from archbishop Tenison, and Burnet bishop of Salisbury: on Sunday morning the sacrament was administered to him. The lords of the privy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>council, and divers noblemen attended in the adjoining apartments, and to some of them who were admitted, he spoke a little. He thanked lord Overkirk for his long and faithful services: he delivered to lord Albemarle the keys of his closet and scrutore, telling him, he knew what to do with them. He inquired for the earl of Portland; but, being speechless before that nobleman arrived, he grasped his hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and laid it to his heart with marks of the most tender affection. On the eighth day of March he expired, in the fifty-second year of his age, after having reigned thirteen years. The lords Lexington and Scarborough, who were in waiting, no sooner perceived the king was dead, than they ordered Ronjat to untie from his left arm a black ribbon, to which was affixed a ring, containing some hair of the late queen Mary. The body being opened and embalmed, lay in state for some time at Kensington; and on the twelfth day of April was deposited in a vault of Henry's chapel in Westminster-abbey. In the beginning of May, a will which he had intrusted with monsieur Schuylemberg, was opened at the Hague. In this he had declared his cousin prince Frison of Nassau, stadtholder of Friesland, his sole and universal heir, and appointed the states-general his executors. By a codicil an∣nexed, he had bequeathed the lordship of Breevert, and a legacy of two hun∣dred thousand guilders, to the earl of Albemarle.</P>

He was
<PB N="235" REF="2380"/>
religious, temperate, generally just and sincere, a stranger to violent transports of passion, and might have passed for one of the best princes of the age in which he lived, had he never ascended the throne of Great-Britain. But, the distin∣guishing criterion of his character was ambition. To this he sacrificed the punctilios of honour and decorum, in deposing his own father-in-law and uncle; and this he gratified at the expence of the nation that raised him to sovereign authority. He aspired to the honour of acting as umpire in all the contests of Europe; and the second object of his attention was, the prosperity of that country to which he owed his birth and extraction. Whether he really thought the interests of the continent and Great-Britain were inseparable, or sought only to drag England into the confederacy as a convenient ally, certain it is, he in∣volved these kingdoms in foreign connexions, which, in all probability, will be productive of their ruin. In order to establish this favourite point, he scrupled not to employ all the engines of corruption, by which the morals of the nation were totally debauched. He procured a parliamentary sanction for a standing army, which now seems to be interwoven in the constitution. He introduced the pernicious practice of borrowing upon remote funds; an expedient that ne∣cessarily hatched a brood of usurers, brokers, and stock-jobbers, to prey upon the vitals of their country. He intailed upon the nation a growing debt, and a<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Boyer. Lamberty. State Tracts. Tindal. Ralph.

<P>WILLIAM was succeeded as sovereign of England, by Anne princess of Denmark, who ascended the throne in the thirty-eighth year of her age, to the general satisfaction of all parties. Even the Jacobites seemed pleased with her elevation, on the supposition, that as in all probability she would leave no heirs of her own body, the dictates of natu∣ral affection would induce her to alter the succession in favour of her own bro∣ther. She had been taught to cherish warm sentiments of the Tories, whom she considered as the friends of monarchy, and the true sons of the church; and they had always professed an inviolable attachment to her person and interest;
<PB N="237" REF="2400"/>
but, her conduct was wholly influenced by the countess of Marlborough, a wo∣man of an imperious temper and intriguing genius, who had been intimate with the princess from her tender years, and gained a surprising ascendancy over her spirit. Anne had undergone some strange vicissitudes of fortune in consequence of her father's expulsion, and sustained a variety of mortifications in the late reign, during which she conducted herself with such discretion, as left little or no pretence for censure or resentment. Such conduct, indeed, was in a great measure owing to a natural temperance of disposition, not easily ruffled or in∣flamed. She was zealously devoted to the church of England, from which her father had used some endeavours to detach her before the revolution; and she lived in great harmony with her husband, to whom she bore six children, all of whom she had already survived. William had no sooner yielded up his breath, than the privy-council in a body waited on the new queen, who, in a short but sen∣sible speech, assured them, that no pains nor diligence should be wanting on her part, to preserve and support the religion, laws, and liberties of her country, to maintain the succession in the protestant line, and the government in church and state, as by law established. She declared her resolution to carry on the prepa∣rations for opposing the exorbitant power of France, and to assure the allies, that she would pursue the true interest of England, together with theirs, for the sup∣port of the common cause. The members of the privy-council having taken the oaths, she ordered a proclamation to be published, signifying her pleasure, that all persons in office of authority or government, at the decease of the late king, should so continue till further directions. By virtue of an act passed in the late reign, the parliament continued sitting even after the king's death. Both houses met immediately, and unanimously voted an address of condolance and congratulation; and, in the afternoon the queen was proclaimed. Next day the lords and commons severally attended her with an address, congratu∣lating her majesty's accession to the throne; and, assuring her of their firm re∣solution to support her against all her enemies whatsoever. The lords acknow∣ledged, that their great loss was no otherwise to be repaired but by a vigorous adherence to her majesty and her allies, in the prosecution of those measures already concerted to reduce the exorbitant power of France. The commons declared, they would maintain the succession of the crown in the protestant line, and effectually provide for the public credit of the nation. These addresses were graciously received by the queen, who, on the eleventh day of March went to the house of peers with the usual solemnity, where, in a speech to both houses, she expressed her satisfaction at their unanimous concurrence with her opinion, that too much could not be done for the encouragement of their allies in hum∣bling the power of France; and, desired they would consider of proper me∣thods towards obtaining an union between England and Scotland. She observed to the commons, that the revenue for defraying the expences of the civil go∣vernment, was expired: and, that she relied intirely on their affection for its being supplied in such a manner as should be most suitable to the honour and dignity of the crown. She declared, it should be her constant endeavour to make them the best return for their duty and affection, by a careful and diligent administration for the good of all her subjects. <Q>“And as I know my own heart to be entirely English (continued she) I can very sincerely assure you, there is not any thing you can expect or desire from me, which I shall not be ready to
<PB N="238" REF="2410"/>
do for the happiness and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty of England; and, you shall always find me a strict and religious observer of my word.”</Q> These assurances were ex∣tremely agreeable to the parliament; and she received the thanks of both houses. Addresses of congratulation were presented by the bishop and clergy of London; by the dissenters in and about that city; and, by all the counties, cities, towns, and corporations of England. She declared her attachment to the church: she promised her protection to the dissenters; and, received the compliments of all her subjects with such affability as insured their affection.</P>

<P>William's death was no sooner known at the Hague, than all Holland was filled with consternation. The states immediately assembled, and for some time gazed at each other in silent fear and astonishment. They sighed, wept, interchanged embraces and vows, that they would act with unanimity, and ex∣pend their dearest blood in defence of their country. Then they dispatched letters to the cities and provinces, informing them of this unfortunate event, and exhorting them to union and perseverance. The express from England having brought the queen's speech to her privy-council, it was translated and published, to revive the drooping spirits of the people. Next day pensionary Fagel imparted to the states of Holland a letter which he had received from the earl of Marlborough, containing assurances in the queen's name of union and assistance. In a few days, the queen wrote a letter in the French language to the states, confirming these assurances; and, it was delivered by Mr. Stanhope, who was now furnished with fresh credentials as envoy from England. Thus animated, the states resolved to prosecute vigorous measures; and their resolu∣tions were still more inspirited by the arrival of the earl of Marlborough, whom the queen honoured with the order of the garter, and invested with the cha∣racter of ambassador extraordinary, and plenipotentiary to the states general: he was likewise declared captain-general of her forces both at home and abroad. He assured the states, that her Britannic majesty would maintain the alliances which had been concluded by the late king, and do every thing that the com∣mon concerns of Europe required. The speech was answered by Dickvelt pre∣sident of the week, who, in the name of the states, expressed their hearty thanks to her majesty, and their resolution of concurring with her in a vigorous prose∣cution of the common interest.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The importance of William's life was evinced by the joy that diffused itself through the kingdom of France at the news of his decease. The person who first brought the tidings to Calais was imprisoned by the governor, until his information was confirmed. The court of Versailles could hardly restrain their transports so as to preserve common decorum: the people of Paris openly rejoiced at the event; all decency was layed aside at Rome, where this incident produced such indecent raptures, that cardinal Grimani the Imperial minister complained of them to the pope, as an insult on his master the emperor, who was William's friend, confederate, and ally. The French king dispatched cre∣dentials to Barre, whom the count D'Avaux had left at the Hague to manage the affairs of France, together with instructions to renew the negotiation with the states, in hope of detaching them from the alliance. This minister presented a memorial, implying severe reflections on king William and the past conduct of the Dutch; and insinuating, that now they had recovered their liberty, the court of France hoped they would consult their true interest. The count de
<PB N="239" REF="2420"/>
Goes envoy from the emperor, animadverted on these expressions in another memorial, which was likewise published; and, the states produced in public an answer to the same remonstrance, expressing their resentment at the insolence of such insinuations, and their veneration for the memory of their late <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tadtholder. The earl of Marlborough succeeded in every part of his negotiation. He ani∣mated the Dutch to a full exertion of their vigour: he concerted the operations of the campaign: he agreed with the states-general and the imperial minister, that war should be declared against France on the same day, at Vienna, London, and the Hague; and, on the third day of April embarked for England, after having acquired the intire confidence of those who governed the United Pro∣vinces.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1702.</NOTE> By this time the house of commons in England had settled the civil list upon the queen for her life; and, when the bill received the royal assent, she assured them, that one hundred thousand pounds of this revenue should be applied to the public service of the current year: at the same time, she passed another bill for receiving and examining the public accounts. A commission for this purpose was granted in the preceding reign, but had been for some years discontinued; and indeed, always proved ineffectual to detect and punish those individuals, who shamefully pillaged their country. The villany was so com∣plicated, the vice so general, and the delinquent so powerfully screened by artifice and interest, as to elude all inquiry. On the twenty-fourth day of March the oath of abjuration was taken by the speaker and members, according to an act for the further security of her majesty's person, and the su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cession of the crown in the protestant line, and for extinguishing the hopes of the pretended prince of Wales. The queen's inclination to the Tories plainly appeared in her choice of ministers. Doctor John Sharp, archbishop of York, became her ghostly di∣rector and counsellor in all ecclesiastical affairs. The earl of Rochester was con∣tinued lord lieutenant of Ireland, and enjoyed a great share of her majesty's confidence: the privy-seal was intrusted to the marquis of Normanby: the earl of Nottingham and Sir Charles Hedges were appointed secretaries of state: the earl of Abingdon, Viscount Weymouth, lord Dartmouth, Sir Christopher Mus∣grave, Greenvil, Howe, Gower, and Harcourt, were admitted as members of the privy-council, together with Sir Edward Seymour, now declared comp∣troller of the houshold. The lord Godolphin declined accepting the office of lord high-treasurer, until he was over-ruled by the persuasions of Marlborough, to whose eldest daughter his son was married. This nobleman refused to command the forces abroad, unless the treasury should be put into the hands of Godol∣phin, on whose punctuality in point of remittances he knew he could depend. George, prince of Denmark, was invested with the title of generalissimo of all the queen's forces by sea and land; and, afterwards created lord high-admiral: the earl of Pembroke having been dismissed from this office with the offer of a large pension, which he generously refused. Prince George, as admiral, was assi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by a council, consisting of Sir George Rooke, Sir David Mitchel, George Churchil, and Richard Hill. Though the legality of this board was doubted, the parliament had such respect and veneration for the queen, that it was suf∣fered to act without question.</P>

<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>A rivalship for the queen's favour already appeared between the earls of Rochester and Marlborough. The former, as first cousin to the queen, and
<PB N="240" REF="2430"/>
chief of the To<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y faction, maintained considerable influence in the council: but even there the interest of his rival predominated. Marlborough was not only the better courtier, but, by the canal of his countess, actually directed the queen in all her resolutions. Rochester proposed in council, that the English should avoid a declaration of war with France, and act as auxiliaries only. He was seconded by some other members: but the opinion of Marlborough preponderated. He observed, that the honour of the nation was concerned to fulfil the late king's engagements; and affirmed that France could never be reduced within due bounds, unless the English would enter as principals in the qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrel. This allegation was supported by the dukes of Somerset and Devon∣shire, the earl of Pembroke, and the majority of the council. The queen re∣solved to declare war, and communicated her intention to the house of com∣mons, by whom it was approved; and, on the fourth day of May, the de∣claration was solemnly proclaimed. The king of France was, in this pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la∣mation, taxed with having taken possession of great part of the Spanish do∣minions; with designing to invade the liberties of Europe; to obstruct the freedom of navigation and commerce; and with having offered an unpardon∣able insult to the queen and her throne, by taking upon him to declare the pretended prince of Wales king of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The three declarations of the emperor, England, and the states-general, which were published in one day, did not fail to discon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert, as well as to provoke, the French monarch. When his minister de Tor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y recited them in his hearing, he spoke of the queen with some acrimony; but with respect to the states-ge∣neral, he declared with great emotion, that <Q>“Messieurs the Dutch merchants should one day repent of their insolence and presumption, in declaring war against so powerful a monarch:”</Q> he did not, however, produce his declara∣tion till the third day of July.</P>

<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The house of commons, in compliance with the queen's desire, brought in a bill, empowering her majesty to name commissioners to treat with the Scots for an union of the two kingdoms. It met with warm opposition from Sir Edward Seymour, and other Tory members, who discharged abundance of sa∣tire and ridicule upon the Scottish nation; but the measure seemed so necessary at that juncture, to secure the protestant succession against the practices of France, and the claims of the pretender, that the majority espoused the bill, which passed through both houses, and, on the sixth day of May received the royal assent, to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ether with some bills of less importance. The enemies of the late king continued to revile his memory <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In their ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of debanch, they drank to the health of sorre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, meaning the ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se that fell with the king; and, under the appeliation of the little gentleman in velvet, to<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted the mole that raised the h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll over which the horse had stumbled.

They even charged him with having formed a design of excluding the princess Anne from the throne, and of introducing the elector of Hanover as his own immediate successor. This report had been so industriously circulated, that it began to gain credit all over the kingdom. Several peers interested themselves in William's character; and a motion was made in the upper house, that the truth of this report should be inquired into. The house immediately desired, that those lords who had visited
<PB N="241" REF="2440"/>
the late king's papers, would intimate whether or not they had found any among them relating to the queen's succession, or to the succession of the house of Hanover. They forthwith declared, that nothing of that fort appeared. Then the house resolved, That the report was groundless, false, villainous, and scandalous, to the dishonour of the late king's memory, and highly tending to the disservice of her present majesty, whom they besought to give order that the authors or publishers of such scandalous reports should be prosecuted by the attorney-general. The same censure was passed upon some li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>els and pamphlets, tending to inflame the factions of the kingdom, and to propagate a spirit of irreligion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doctor Binkes, in a sermon preached before the convocation, on the thirtieth day of January, drew a parallel between the sufferings of Christ, and those of king Charles, to which last he gave the preference, in point of right, character, and station.</NOTE>. On the twenty-first day of May, the commons, in an address, advised her majesty to engage the emperor, the states-general, and her other allies, to join with her in prohibiting all intercourse with France and Spain; and to concert such methods with the states-general, as might most effectually secure the trade of her subjects and allies.

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>In Scotland, a warm contest arose between the revolutioners and those in the opposition, concerning the existence of the present parliament. The queen had signified her accession to the throne, in a letter to her privy-council for Scotland, desiring they would continue to act in that office until she should send a new commission, authorising them to publish a proclamation, ordaining all officers of state, counsellors, and magistrates, to act in all things conformably to the commissions and instructions they had from his late majesty, until new commissions could be prepared. She likewise assured them of her firm resolu∣tion to protect them in their religion, laws, and liberties, and in the established government of the church. She had already, in presence of twelve Scottish counsellors, taken the coronation-oath for that kingdom: but those who wanted to embroil the affairs of their country, affirmed, that this was an irregular way of proceeding, and that the oath ought to have been tendered by persons deputed for that purpose, either by the parliament, or the privy-council of the kingdom. The present ministry, consisting of the duke of Queensberry, the earls of March∣mont,
<PB N="242" REF="2450"/>
Melvil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Seafield, Hyndford<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Selkirk, were devoted to revolution-prin∣ciples<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and desirous that the parliament should continue, in pursuance of a late act for continuing the parliament that should be then in being, six months after the death of the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that it should assemble in twenty days after that event. The queen had<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by several adjournments, deferred the meeting almost three months after the king's decease; and therefore the anti-r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>volutioners af∣firmed that it was dissolved. The duke of Hamilton was at the head of this party, which clamoured loudly for a new parliament. This nobleman, to∣gether with the marquis of Tweedale, the earls Marshal and Rothes, and many other noblemen, repaired to London, in order to make the queen acquainted with their objections to the continuance of the present parliament. She ad∣mitted them to her presence, and calmly heard their allegations: but she was d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ermined, by the advice of her privy-council for that kingdom, who were of opinion that the nation was in too great a ferment to hazard the convoca∣tion of a new parliament. According to the queen's last adjournment, the parliament met at Edinburgh on the ninth day of June, the duke of Queensberry having been appointed high commissioner. Before the queen's commission was read, the Duke of Hamilton, for himself and his adherents, declared their sa∣tisfaction at her majesty's accession to the throne, not only on account of her undoubted right by descent, but likewise because of her many personal virtues and royal qualities. He said they were resolved to sacrifice their lives and for∣tunes in defence of her majesty's right against all her enemies whatever; but, at the same time, they thought themselves bound in duty to give their opinion, that they were not warranted by law to sit and act as a parliament. He then read a paper to the following effect: That forasmuch as, by the fundamental laws and constitution of this kingdom, all parliaments do dissolve on the death of the sovereign, except in so far as innovated by an act in the preceding reign, that the parliament in being at his decease should meet, and act what might be needful for the defence of the true protestant religion as by law established; and for the maintenance of the succession to the crown, as settled by the claim of right; and for the preservation and security of the public peace. And seeing these ends are fully answered by her majesty's succession to the throne, we conceive ourselves not now warranted by law to meet, sit, or act; and therefore do dissent from any thing that shall be done or acted. The duke having re∣cited this paper, and formally protested against the proceedings of the parlia∣ment, withdrew with seventy nine members, amidst the acclamations of the people.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding their secession, the commissioner, who retained a much greater number, produced the queen's letter, signifying her resolution to maintain and protect her subjects in the full possession of their religion, laws, liberties, and the presbyterian discipline. She informed them of her having de∣clared war against France: she exhorted them to provide competent supplies for maintaining such a number of forces as might be necessary for disappointing the enemy's designs, and preserving the present happy settlement; and she earnestly recommended to their consideration an union of the two kingdoms. The duke of Queensberry and the earl of Marchmont having eforced the different ar∣ticles of this letter, committees were appointed for the security of the kingdom,
<PB N="243" REF="2460"/>
for controverted elections, for drawing up an answer to her majesty's letter, and for revising the minutes. Mean while, the duke of Hamilton and his ad∣herents sent the lord Blantyre to London with an address to the queen, who refused to receive it, and wrote another letter to the parliament, expressing her resolution to maintain their dignity and authority against all opposers. They, in answer to the former, had assured her, that the groundless secession of some members should increase and strengthen their care and zeal for her majesty's service. They expelled Sir Alexander Bruce, for having given vent to some reflexions against presbytery. The lord advocate prosecuted the faculty of advocates before the parliament, for having passed a vote among themselves in favour of the protestation and address of the dissenting members. The fa∣culty was severely reprimanded; but the whole nation seemed to resent the prosecution. The parliament passed an act recognizing her majesty's royal au∣thority: another for adjourning the court of judicature called the session: a third declaring this meeting of parliament legal; and forbidding any person to disown, quarrel, or impugn, the dignity and authority thereof, under the penalty of high treason: a fourth for securing the true protestant religion and presbyterian church-government: a fifth for a land-tax; and a sixth enabling her majesty to appoint commissioners for an union between the two king∣doms.</P>

<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>The earl of Marchmont, of his own accord, and even contrary to the advice of the high-commissioner, brought in a bill for abjuring the pretended prince of Wales: but this was not supported by the court-party, as the com∣missioner had no instructions how to act on the occasion. Perhaps the queen and her English ministry resolved to keep the succession open in Scotland, as a check upon the Whigs and house of Hanover. On the thirtieth day of June, the commissioner adjourned the parliament, after having thanked them for their chearfulness and unanimity in their proceedings; and the chie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the op∣posite parties hastened to London, to make their different representations to the queen and her ministry. In the mean time, she appointed commissioners for treating about the union; and they met at the Cockpit on the twenty-second day of October. On the twentieth day of the next month, they adjusted the preliminaries, importing, That nothing agreed on among themselves should be binding, except it be ratified by her majesty and the respective parliaments of both nations; and that, unless all the heads proposed for the treaty were agreed to, no particular thing agreed on should be binding. The queen vi∣sited them in December, in order to quicken their mutual endeavours. They agreed, that the two kingdoms should be inseparably united into one monarchy, under her majesty, her heirs, and successors, and under the same limitations, according to the acts of settlement: but, when the Scottish commissioners pro∣posed that the rights and privileges of their company trading to Africa and the Indies, should be preserved and maintained, such a difficulty arose as could not be surmounted; and no further progress was made in this commission. The tranquillity of Ireland was not interrupted by any new commotion. That kingdom was ruled by justices whom the earl of Rochester had appointed; and the trustees for the forfeited estates maintained their authority.</P>

<P>While Britain was engaged in these civil transactions, her allies were not idle on the continent. The old duke of Zell, and his nephew the elector of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>swick, surprised the dukes of Wolfembuttle and Saxe-Gotha, whom they compelled to renounce their attachments to France, and concur in the com∣mon councils of the empire. Thus the north of Germany was re-united in the interest of the confederates; and the princes would have been in a condition to assist them effectually, had not the neighbourhood of the war in Poland de∣terred them from parting with their forces. England and the states-general endeavoured in vain to mediate a peace between the kings of Sweden and Po∣land. Charles was become enamoured of war, and ambitious of conquest. He threatened to invade Saxony through the dominions of Prussia. Augustus retired to Cracow, while Charles penetrated to Warsaw, and even ordered the cardinal-primate to summon a diet for chusing a new king. The situation of affairs at this juncture was far from being favourable to the allies. The court of Vienna had tampered in vain with the elector of Bavaria, who made use of this negotiation to raise his terms with Lewis. His brother the elector of Co∣log<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, admitted French garrisons into Liege, and all his places on the Rhine. The elector of Saxony was too hard pressed by the king of Sweden, to spare his full proportion of troops to the allies: the king of Prussia was overawed by the vicinity of the Swedish conqueror: the duke of Savoy had joined his forces to those of France, and over-run the whole state of Milan: and the pope, though he professed a neutrality, evinced himself strongly bia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to the French interests.</P>

<P>The war was begun in the name of the elector palatine with the siege of Keiserswaert, which was invested in the month of April by the prince of Nassau Saarbrugh, marechal du camp to the emperor; under this officer the Dutch troops served as auxiliaries, because war had not yet been declared by the states-general. The French garrison made a desperate defence. They worsted the besiegers in divers sallies, and maintained the place until it was reduced to a heap of ashes. At length the allies made a general attack upon the counter∣scarp and ravelin, which they carried after a very obstinate engagement, with the loss of two thousand men. Then the garrison capitulated on honourable terms, and the fortifications were razed. During this siege, which lasted from the eighteenth day of April to the middle of June, count Tallard posted him∣self on the opposite side of the Rhine, from whence he supplied the town with fresh troops and ammunition, and annoyed the besiegers with his artillery; but finding it impossible to save the place, he joined the grand army, commanded by the duke of Burgundy in the Netherlands. The siege of Keiserswaert was covered by a body of Dutch troops under the earl of Athlone, who lay en∣camped in the dutchy of Cleve. Mean while general Coehorn, at the head of another detachment entered Flanders, demolished the French lines between the forts of Donat and Isabella, and laid the chatellanie of Bruges under contribu∣tion: but a considerable body of French troops advancing under the marquis de Bedmar, and the count de la Motte, he overflowed the country, and retired under the walls of Sluys. The duke of Burgundy, who had taken the com∣mand of the French army under Boufflers, encamped at Zanten, near Cleve, and laid a scheme for surprising Nimeguen; in which, however, he was baffled
<PB N="245" REF="2480"/>
by the vigilance and activity of Athlone, who guessing his design, marched thither and encamped under the cannon of the town. In the beginning of June<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Landau was invested by prince Lewis of Baden: in july the king of the Romans arrived in the camp of the besiegers, with such pomp and magnificence as exhausted his father's treasury. On the ninth day of September the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adel was taken by assault, and then the town surrendered.</P>

<P>When the earl of Marlborough arrived in Holland, the earl of Ath∣lone, in quality of veldt-marechal, insisted upon an equal command with the English general; but the states obliged him to yield this point in favour of Marlborough, whom they declared generalissimo of all their forces. In the beginning of July he repaired to the camp at Nimeguen, where he soon as∣sembled an army of sixty thousand men, well provided with all necessaries; and then he convoked a council of the general officers, to concert the operations of the campaign. On the sixteenth day of the month he passed the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, and encamped at Over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asselt, within two leagues and a half of the enemy, who had intrenched themselves between Goch and Gennep. He afterwards repassed the river below the Grave, and removed to Gravenbroeck, where he was joined by the British train of artillery from Holland. On the second day of August, he advanced to Petit Brugel, and the French retired before him, leaving Spanish Guelderland to his discretion. He had resolved to hazard an engagement, and issued orders accordingly; but he was restrained by the Dutch deputies, who were afraid of their own interest, in case the battle should have proved unfortunate. The duke of Burgundy finding himself obliged to retreat before the allied army, rather than expose himself longer to such a mortifying indignity, returned to Versailles, leaving the command to Boufflers, who lost the confidence of Lewis by the ill success of this campaign. The deputies of the states-general having represented to the earl of Marlborough the advantages that would accrue to Holland, from his dispossessing the enemy of the places they maintained in the Spanish Guelderland, by which the navigation of the Maese was obstructed, and the important town of Maestricht in a manner blocked up, he resolved to deliver them from such a troublesome neighbour∣hood. He detached general Schultz with a body of troops to reduce the town and castle of Werk, which were surrendered after a slight resistance, In the beginning of September, he undertook the siege of Venlo, which capitulated on the twenty-fifth day of the month, after fort St. Michael had been stormed and taken by lord Cutts and the English volunteers, among whom the young earl of Huntington distinguished himself by very extraordinary acts of valour. Then the general invested Ruremonde, which he reduced after a very obstinate defence, together with the fort of Stevensuaert, situated on the same river. Boufflers, confounded at the rapidity of Marlborough's success, retired towards Liege, in order to cover that city<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but, at the approach of the confederates, he retired with precipitation to Tongeren, from whence he directed his route towards Brabant, with a view to detend such places as the allies had no design to attack. When the earl of Marlborough arrived at Liege, he found the suburbs of St. Walburgh had been set on fire by the French garrison, who had retired into the citadel and the Chartreux. The allies took immediate pos∣session of the city; and in a few days opened the trenches against the citadel,
<PB N="246" REF="2490"/>
which was taken by ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ult. On this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereditary prince of He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e-Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> charged at the head of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and was the first person who mounted the breach.

Three hundred thousand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rins i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gold and silver were found in the citadel, besides notes for above one million, drawn upon substantial merchants in Liege, who pay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the money. Immediately after this exploit, the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrison of the Chartreux capitulated on honourable terms, and were con∣ducted to Antwerp. By the success of this campaign, the earl of Marlborough raised his military character above all censure, and confirmed himself i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the intire confidence of the states-general, who, in the beginning of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>on, had trembled for Nimeguen, and now saw the enemy driven back into their own domains.</P>

<P>When the army broke up in November, the general repaired to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ric<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, from whence he proposed to return to the Hague by water. Ac∣cordingly he embarked in a large boat, with five and twenty soldiers, under the command of a lieutenant. Ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t morning he was joined at Ruremonde by Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n, in a larger vessel, with sixty men; and they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over escorted by fifty troopers that rode along-side of the river. The large boat outsailed the other, and the horsemen mistook their way in the dark. A French partizan, with five and thirty men from Gueldres, who lurked among the rushes in wait for prey, seized the rope by which the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was drawn, hauled it ashore, discharged their small arms and hand-grenades, then rushing into it, se∣cured the soldiers before they could put themselves in a posture of defence. The earl of Marlborough was accomp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nied by general Opdam, and Mynheer Gueldermalsen, one of the deputies, who were provided with p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ports. The earl had neglected this precaution; but recollecting he had an old passport for his brother general Churchill, he produced it without any emotion; and the partizan was in such confusion that he never examined the date. Nevertheless, he ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed their baggage, carried off the guard as prisoners, and allowed the boat to proceed. The governor of Venlo receiving information that the earl was surprised by a party and conveyed to Gueldres, immediately marched out with his whole garrison to invest that place. The same imperfect account being transmitted to Holland, filled the whole province with consternation. The states forthwith assembling, resolved that all their forces should march immediately to Gueldres, and threaten the garrison of the place with the ut∣most extremities, unless they would immediately deliver the general. But, before these orders could be dispatched, the earl arrived at the Hague, to the inexpressible joy of the people, who already looked upon him as their saviour and protector.</P>

In vain did thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> powers protest against their proceedings. The empire's de∣claration of war was published and notified, in the name of the diet, to the cardinal of Limberg, the emperor's commissioner.

The French army was divided into two bodies, commanded by the marquis de Villars and the count de Gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scard; and the prince thinking himself in danger of being enclosed by the enemy, re∣solved to decamp.

<P>In Italy, prince Eugene laboured under a total neglect of the Im∣perial court, where his enemies, on pretence of supporting the king of the Romans in his first campaign, weaned the emperor's attention intirely from his affairs in Italy; so that he left his bes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> army to mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lder away for want of recruits and reinforcements. The prince thus abandoned, could not prevent the duke of Vendome from relieving Mantua, and was obliged to relinquish some other places he had taken. Philip king of Spain being inspired with the ambition of putting an end to the war in this country, failed in person for Naples, where he was visited by the cardinal l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te, with a compliment from the pope; yet he could not obtain the investiture of the kingdom from his holiness The emperor, however, was so disgusted at the embassy which the pope had sent to Philip, that he ordered his ambassador at Rome to withdraw. Philip proceeded from Naples to Final, under convoy of the French <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet which had brought him to Italy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he had an interview with the duke of Savoy, who began to be alarmed at the prospect of the French king's being master of the Milanese; and, in a letter to the duke of Vendome, he forbade him to engage prince Eugene until he himself should arrive in the camp. Prince Eugene understanding that the French army intended to attack Luzzara and Gua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>alla, passed the Po, with an army of about half the number of the enemy, and posted him∣self behind the dyke of Zero, in such a manner that the French were ignorant
<PB N="248" REF="2510"/>
of his situation. He concluded, that on their arrival at the ground they had chosen, the horse would march out to forage, while the rest of the army would be employed in pitching tents, and providing for their re∣freshment. His design was to seize that opportunity of attacking them, not doubting that he should obtain a complete victory: but he was disappointed by mere accident. An adjutant, with an advanced guard, had the curiosity to ascend the dyke, in order to view the country, when he discovered the Imperial infantry lying on their faces, and their horse in the rear, ranged in order of battle. The French camp was immediately alarmed; and, as the intermediate ground was covered with hedges, which obliged the assailants to defile, the enemy were in a posture of defence before the Imperialists could ad∣vance to action: nevertheless, the prince attacked them with great vivacity, in hope of disordering their line, which gave way in several places; but night interposing, he was obliged to desist; and, in a few days, the French reduced Luzzara and Guastalia. The prince, however, maintained his posts, and Philip returned to Spain, without having obtained any considerable advantage.</P>

<P>The French king employed all his artifice and intrigues in raising up new enemies against the confederates.

At the Ottoman Porte he had actually gained over the vizir, who engaged to renew the war with the emperor. But the Mufti and all the other great officers were averse to this design, and the vizir fell a sacrifice to their resentment. Lewis continued to embroil the kingdom of Poland by means of the cardinal primate. The young king of Sweden advanced to Lissaw, where he defeated Augustus. Then he took possession of Cracow, and raised contributions; nor could he be persuaded to retreat, although the Muscovites and Lithuanians had ravaged Livonia, and even made an irruption into Sweden.</P>

<P>The operations of the combined squadrons at sea did not fully answer the expectations of the public. On the twelfth day of May, Sir John Munden put to sea with twelve sail of ships, to intercept a French squadron ap∣pointed as a convoy to a new viceroy of Mexico, from Corunna to the West Indies. On the twenty-eighth day of the month, he chased fourteen sail of French ships into Corunna. Then he called a council of war, in which it was agreed, that as the place was strongly fortified, and by the intelligence they had received, it appeared that seventeen of the enemy's ships of war rode at anchor in the harbour, it would be expedient for them to follow the latter part of their instructions, by which they were directed to cruise in soundings for the protection of the trade. They returned accordingly, and being distressed by want of provisions, came into port, to the general discontent of the nation. For the satisfaction of the people, Sir John Munden was tried by a court-martial, and acquitted; but as this miscarriage had rendered him very unpopular, prince George dismissed him from the service. We have already hinted, that king William had projected a scheme to reduce Cadiz, with intention to act after∣wards against the Spanish settlements in the West-Indies. This design queen Anne resolved to put in execution. Sir George Rooke commanded the fleet, and the duke of Ormond was appointed general of the land-forces destined for
<PB N="249" REF="2520"/>
this expedition. The combined squadrons amounted to fifty ships of the line, exclusive of frigates, fireships, and smaller vessels; and, the number of soldiers embarked was not far short of fourteen thousand. In the latter end of June the fleet sailed from St. Helen's; and, on the twelfth of August they anchored at the distance of two leagues from Cadiz. Next day, the duke of Ormond summoned the duke de Brancaccio, who was governor, to submit to the house of Austria; but, that officer answered, he would acquit himself honourably of the trust reposed in him by the king. On the fifteenth the duke of Ormond landed with his forces in the bay of Bulls, under cover of a smart fire from some frigates, and repulsed a body of Spanish cavalry: then he summoned the go∣vernor of fort St. Catherine's to surrender; and received an answer, import∣ing, that the garrison was prepared for his reception. A declaration was pub∣lished in the Spanish language, intimating, that the allies did not come as ene∣mies to Spain; but, only to free them from the yoke of France, and assist them in establishing themselves under the government of the house of Austria. These professions produced very little effect among the Spaniards, who were either cooled in their attachment to that family, or provoked by the excesses of the English troops, which having taken possession of Fort St. Catherine, and Port St. Mary's, instead of protecting, plundered the natives, notwithstanding the strict orders issued by the duke of Ormond, to prevent this scandalous practice: even some general-officers were concerned in the pillage. A battery was raised against Montagorda-fort opposite to the Puntal; but, the attempt miscarried, and the troops were reimbarked.</P>

<P>Captain Hardy having been sent to water in Lagos-bay, received intelligence, that the galleons from the West-Indies had put into Vigo, under convoy of a French squadron. He sailed immediately in quest of Sir George Rooke, who was now in his voyage back to England, and falling in with him on the sixth day of October, communicated the substance of what he had learned. Rooke immediately called a council of war, in which it was deter∣mined, to alter their course and attack the enemy at Vigo. He forthwith de∣tached some small vessels for intelligence, and received a confirmation, that the galleons and the squadron commanded by Chateau Renault, were actually in the harbour. They sailed thither, and appeared before the place on the eleventh day of October. The passage into the harbour was narrow, secured by batte∣ries, forts, and breast works on each side; by a strong boom, consisting of iron∣chains, topmasts, and cables, moored at each end to a seventy-gun ship, and fortified within by five ships of the same strength, lying athwart the channel, with their broad-sides to the offing. As the first and second rates of the com∣bined fleets were too large to enter, the admirals shifted their flags into smaller ships; and a division of five and twenty English and Dutch ships of the line, with their frigates, fireships, and ketches, was destined for the service. In order to facilitate the attack, the duke of Ormond landed with five and twenty hundred men, at the distance of six miles from Vigo, and took by assault a fort and plat∣form of forty pieces of cannon, at the entrance of the harbour. The British ensign was no sooner s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en flying at the top of this fort, than the ships advanced to the attack. Vice-admiral Hopson, in the Torbay, crowding all his sail, ran directly against the boom, which was broken by the first shock; then the whole squad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on entered the harbour, through a prodigious fire from the enemy's ships

and batteries. These last<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> however, were soon sto<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>med and taken by the gre∣nadiers who had been landed.

After a very vigorous engagement, the French finding themselves unable to cope with such an adversary, resolved to destory their ships and galleons, that they might not fall into the hands of the victors. They accordingly burned and ran ashore eight ships and as many advice-boats; but, ten ships of war were taken, toge∣ther with eleven galleons. Though they had secured the best part of their plate and merchandize before the English fleet arrived, the value of fourteen million of pieces of eight, in plate and rich commodities, was destroyed in six galleons that perished; but, about half that value was brought off by the con∣querors: so that this was a dreadful blow to the enemy, and a noble acquisition to the allies. Immediately after this exploit Sir George Rooke was joined by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who had been sent out with a squadron to intercept the galleons. This officer was left to bring home the prizes and dismantle the for∣tif<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cations, while Rooke returned in triumph to England.</P>

<P>The glory which the English acquired in this expedition was in some measure tarnished by the conduct of some officers in the West-Indies. Thither admiral Benbow had been detached with a squadron of ten sail, in the course of the preceding year. At Jamaica he received intelligence, that monsieur Du Caffe was in the neighbourhood of Hispaniola, and resolved to beat up to that island. At Leogane he fell in with a French ship of fifty guns, which her cap∣tain ran ashore and blew up. He took several other vessels, and having alarmed Petit-Guavas, bore away for Donna Maria bay, where he understood, that Du Caffe had sailed for the coast of Carthagene. Benbow resolved to follow the same course; and on the nineteenth of August discovered the enemy's squadron near St. Martha, consisting of ten sail steering along shore. He formed the line; and an engagement ensued, in which he was very ill seconded by some of his captains. Nevertheless, the battle continued till night, and he determined to renew it next morning, when he perceived all his ships at the distance of three of four miles astern, except the Ruby, commanded by captain George Walton, who joined him in plying the enemy with chace-guns. On the twenty∣first these two ships engaged the French squadron; and, the Ruby was so dis∣abled, that the admiral was obliged to send her back to Jamaica. Next day the Greenwich, commanded by Wade, was five leagues astern; and the wind changing, the enemy had the advantage of the weather-gage. On the twenty-third the admiral renewed the battle with his single ship, unsustained by the rest of the squadron. On the twenty-fourth his leg was shattered by a chain-shot; notwithstanding which accident, he remained on the quarter-deck in a cradle, and continued the engagement. One of the largest ships of the enemy lying like a wreck upon the water, four sail of the English squadron poured their broadsides into her, and then ran to leeward, without paying any regard to the signal for battle. Then the French bearing down upon the admiral with their whole force, shot away his m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>intopsail-yard, and damaged his rigging in such a manner, that he was obliged to lie by and resit, while they took their disabled ship in tow. During this interval, he called a council of his capt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns, and ex∣postulated with them on their behaviour. They observed, that the French
<PB N="251" REF="2540"/>
were very strong, and advised him to desist. He plainly perceived that he w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s betrayed, and with the utmost reluctance returned to Jamaica, having not only lost a leg, but also received a large wound in his face, and another in his arm, while he in person boarded the French admiral. Exasperated at the treachery of his captains, he granted a commission to rear admiral Whetstone and other officers to hold a court-martial, and try them for cowardice. Hudson of the Pendennis died before his trial: Kirby and Wade were convicted and sentenced to be shot: Constable of the Windsor was cashiered and imprisoned: Vincent of the Falmouth, and Fogg the admiral's own captain of the Breda, were con∣victed of having signed a paper, that they would not fight under Benbow's command; but, as they behaved gallantly in the action, the court inflicted upon them no other punishment than that of a provisional suspension. Captain Walton had likewise joined in the conspiracy while he was heated with the fumes of intoxication; but, he afterwards renounced the engagement, and fought with admirable courage until his ship was disabled. The boisterous manners of Ben∣bow had produced this base confederacy. He was a rough seaman; but, remark∣ably brave, honest, and experienced <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When one of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eutenants expressed his sorrow for the loss of the admiral's leg, <Q>“I am sorry for it too (replied the gallant Benbow) but, I had rather have lost them both than have seen this dishonour brought upon the English nation. But, do you hear? If another <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ot should take me off, behave like brave men, and fight it out.”</Q> W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n Du Cals<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> arrived at Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣thagene, he wrote a letter to Benbow to this effect, <Q>“Sir, I had little hope on Monday last but to have s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pped in your cabin; but, it pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d God to order it otherwise. I am thankful for it. As for those cowardly captains who deserted you, hang them up; for, by God they deserve it. Yours, Du Caffe.”</Q></NOTE>. He took this miscarriage so much to heart, that he became melancholy, and his grief co-operating with the fever occasioned by his wounds, put a period to his life. Wade and Kirby were sent home in the Bristol; and, on their arrival at Plymouth, shot on board of the ship, by virtue of a dead-warrant for their immediate execution, which had lain there for some time. The same precaution had been taken in all the western ports, in order to prevent applications in their favour.</P>

<P>During these transactions, the queen seemed to be happy in the affec∣tion of her subjects. Though the continuance of the parliament was limited to six months after the king's decease, she dissolved it by proclamation before that term was expired; and, issued writs for electing another, in which the Tory interest predominated. In the summer the queen gave audience to the count de Platens, envoy extraordinary from the elector of Hanover; then she made a progress with her husband to Oxford, Bath, and Bristol, where she was received with all the marks of the most genuine affection. The new parliament meeting on the twentieth day of October, Mr. Harley was chosen speaker. The queen in her speech declared, she had summoned them to assist her in car∣rying on the just and necessary war in which the nation was engaged. She de∣sired the commons would inspect the accounts of the public receipts and pay∣ments, that if any abuses had crept into the management of the finances, they might be detected, and the offenders punished. She told them, that the funds assigned in the last parliament had not produced the sums granted; and, that the deficiency was not supplied even by the hundred thousand pounds which she had payed from her own revenue for the public service. She expressed her concern for the disappointment at Cadiz, as well as for the abuses committed at port St.

Mary's, which had obliged her to give directions for the strictest examination of the particulars. She hoped they would find time to consider of some better and more effectual method to prevent the exportation of wool, and improve that manufacture, which she was determined to encourage. She professed a firm persuasion, that the affection of her subjects was the surest pledge of their duty and obedience. She promised to defend and maintain the church as by law established; and, protect her subjects in the full enjoyments of all their rights and liberties. She protested, that she relied on their care of her: she said her interest and theirs were inseparable; and, that her endeavours should never be wanting to make them all safe and happy. She was presented with a very af∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctionate address from either house, congratulating her upon the glorious suc∣cess of her arms, and those of her allies, under the command of the earl of Marlborough; but, that of the commons was distinguished by an implicated reproach on the late reign, importing, that the wonderful progress of her ma∣jesty's arms under the earl of Marlborough, had signally "retrieved" the antient honour and glory of the English nation. This expression had excited a warm debate in the house, in the course of which many severe reflections were made on the memory of king William. At length, the question was put, Whether the word "Retrieved" should remain? and, carried in the affirmative by a ma∣jority of one hundred.</P>

<P>The strength of the Tories appeared in nothing more conspicuous than in their inquiry concerning controverted elections. The borough of Hin∣don near Salisbury was convicted of bribery, and a bill brought in for dis∣franchising the town; yet, no vote passed against the person who exercised this corruption, because he happened to be a Tory. Mr. Howe was declared duly elected for Gloucestershire, tho' the majority of the electors had voted for the other candidate. Sir John Packington having exhibited a complaint against the bishop of Worcester and his son, for having endeavoured to prevent his election; the commons having taken it into consideration, resolved, that the proceedings of William, lord bishop of Worcester, and his son, had been ma∣licious, unchristian, and arbitrary, in high violation of the liberties and privi∣leges of the commons of England. They voted an address to the queen, desiring her to remove the father from the office of lord-almoner; and, they ordered the attorney-general to prosecute the son, after his privilege as member of the convocation should be expired. A counter-address was immedi∣ately voted, and presented by the lords, beseeching her majesty would not remove the bishop of Worcester from the place of lord-almoner, until he should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound guilty of some crime by due course of law; as it was the undoubted right of every lord of parliament, and of every subject of England, to have an opportunity to make his defence before he suffers any sort of punishment. The queen said, she had not as yet received any complaint against the bishop of Worcester; but, she looked upon it as her undoubted right to continue or dis∣place any servant attending upon her own person, when she should think proper. The peers having received this answer, unanimously resolved, That no lord of their house ought to suffer any sort of punishment by any proceedings of the house of commons, otherwise than according to the known and antient rules and methods of parliament. When the commons attended the queen with their address against the bishop, she said, she was sorry there was occasion for such a
<PB N="253" REF="2560"/>
remonstrance; and, that the bishop of Worcester should no longer continue to supply the place of her almoner. This regard to their address was a flagrant proof of her partiality to the Tories, who seemed to justify her attachment by their compliance and liberality.</P>

<P>In deliberating on the supplies, they agreed to all the demands of the ministry. They voted forty thousand seamen, and the like number of land∣forces, to act in conjunction with those of the allies. For the maintenance of these last, they granted eight hundred and thirty-three thousand eight hundred and twenty-six pounds; besides three hundred and fifty thousand pounds for guards and garrisons; seventy thousand nine hundred and seventy-three pounds for ord∣nance; and fifty-one thousand eight hundred and forty-three pounds for subsides to the allies. The lord Shannon arriving with the news of the success at Vigo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the queen appointed a day of thanksgiving for the signal success of her arms under the earl of Marlborough, the duke of Ormond, and Sir George Rooke; and, on that day, which was the twelfth of November, she went in state to St. Paul's church, attended by both houses of parliament. Next day, the peers voted the thanks of their house to the duke of Ormond for his services at Vigo; and, at the same time, drew up an address to the queen, desiring she would order the duke of Ormond and Sir George Rooke to lay before them an account of their proceedings: a request with which her majesty complied. Those two officers were likewise thanked by the house of commons; and, vice-admiral Hopson was knighted and gratified with a considerable pension. The duke of Ormond, at his return from the expedition, complained openly of Rooke's conduct, and seemed determined to subject him to a public accusation; but, that officer was such a favourite among the commons, that the court was afraid to disoblige them by an impeachment, and took great pains to mitigate the duke's resentment. This nobleman was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and Rooke was admitted into the privy-council. A motion, however, being made in the house of lords, that the admiral's instructions and journals rel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting to the last expedition might be examined, a committee was appointed for that purpose, and prepared an unfavourable report: but, it was rejected by a majo∣rity of the house; and, they voted, That Sir George Rooke had done his duty, pursuant to the councils of war, like a brave officer, to the honour of the British nation.</P>

<P>On the twenty-first day of November the queen sent a message to the house of commons by Mr. secretary Hedges, recommending further provision for the prince her husband, in case he should survive her. This message being considered, Mr. Howe moved, That the yearly sum of one hundred thousand pounds should be settled on the prince, in case he should survive her majesty. No opposition was made to the proposal; but, warm debates were excited by a clause in the bill, exempting the prince from that part of the act of succession by which strangers, though naturalized, were rendered incapable of holding employments. This clause related only to those who should be naturalized in a future reign; and indeed was calculated as a restriction upon the house of Hanover. Many members argued against this clause of exemption, because it seemed to imply, that persons already naturalized would be excluded from employments in the next reign, though already possessed of the right of na∣tural-born subjects, a consequence plainly contradictory to the meaning of the
<PB N="254" REF="2570"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct. Others opposed it, because the lords had already resolved by a vote, That they would never pass any bill sent up from the commons, to which a clause foreign to the bill should be t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked; and this clause they affirmed to be a tack, as an incapacity to hold employments was a circumstance altogether distinct from a settlement in money. The queen expressed uncommon eager∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in behalf of this bill; and the court-influence was managed so successfully, that it passed through both houses, though not without an obstinate opposition, and a formal protest by seven and twenty peers.</P>

<P>The earl of Marlborough arriving in England about the latter end of Nov<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber, received the thanks of the commons for his great and signal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vices, which were so ac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eptable to the queen, that she created him a duke, g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ified him with a pension of five thousand pounds upon the revenue of the po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce during his natural life; and, in a message to the commons, expressed a de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e, that they would find some method to settle it on the heirs-male of his body. This intimation was productive of warm debates, during which Sir C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>topher Musgrave observed, that he would not derogate from the duke's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inent services; but, he affirmed, his grace had been very well payed for them, by the profitable employments which he and his dutchess enjoyed. The d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke understanding that the commons were heated by the subject, begged her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>jesty would rather forego her gracious message in his behalf, than create any uneasiness on his account, which might embarrass her affairs, and be of ill con∣sequenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the public. Then she sent another message to the house, signifying, that the duke of Marlborough had declined her interposition. Notwithstand∣ing this decla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, the commons in a body presented an address, acknowledg∣ing the eminent services of the duke of Marlborough, and expressing their ap∣prehension of making a precedent to alienate the revenue of the crown, which had been so much reduced by the exorbitant grants of the late reign, and so l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ely settled and secured by her majesty's unparalleled grace and goodness.

<P>The commons of this parliament had nothing mor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at heart tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a bill against occasional conformity. The Tories affected to distinguish them∣selves as the only true friends to the church and monarchy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed the dissenters with a mixture of spiritual and political disgust. They look<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d upon them as an intruding sect, which constituted great part of the Whig faction that extorted such immense sums of money from the nation in the late reign, and involved it in pernicious engagements, from whence it had no prosp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> deliverance. They considered them as incroaching schismatics that disgrac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and endangered the hierarchy; and, those of their own communion who recom∣mended moderation, they branded with the epithets of lukewarm christi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, be∣trayers, and apostates. They now resolved to approve themselves zealous so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the church, by seizing the first opportunity that was in their power to distress th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> dissenters. In order to pave the way to this persecution, sermons were pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and pamphlets were printed to blacken the character of the sect, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the popular resentment against them. On the fourth day of November, Mr. Bromley, Mr. St. John, and Mr. Annesley, were ordered by the house of co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mons to bring in a bill for preventing occasional conformity. In the preamble all presecution for conscience sake was condemned: nevertheless, it enacted, That all those who had taken the sacrament and test for offices of trust, or the magis∣tracy of corporations, and afterwards frequented any meeting of diss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, should be disabled from holding their employments, pay a fine of one hundred pounds, and five pounds for every day in which they continued to act in their employments afte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> having been at any such meeting: they were also rendered incapable of holding any other employment, till after one whole year's conformity; and, upon a re∣lapse, the penalties and time of incapacity were doubled. The promoters of the bill alledged, that an established religion and national church were ab∣solutely necessary, when so many impious men pretended to inspiration, and deluded such numbers of the people: that the most effectual way to preserve this national church, would be the maintenance of the civil power in the hand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of those who expressed their regard to the church in their principles and practi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the parliament, by the corporation and test-acts, thought they had raised a sufficient barrier to the hierarchy, never imagining that a set of men would rise up, whose consciences would be too<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ender to obey the law<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but hardene<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> enough to break them: that, as the last reign began with an act in favour of dissenters, so the commons were desirous that in the beginning of her majesty'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> auspicious government, an act should pass in favour of the church of En<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣land: that this bill did not intrench on the act of toleration, or deprive the dis∣senters of any privileges they enjoyed by law, or add any thing to the legal right<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the church of England: that occasional conformity was an evasion of the law, by which the dissenters might insinuate themselves into the management of all corporations: that a separation from the church, to which a man's con∣science will allow him occasionally to conform, is a mere schism, which in itself was sinful, without the superaddition of a temporal law to make i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an offence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the toleration was intended only for the ease of tender consciences, and not to give a licence for occasional conformity: that conforming and nonconform∣ing were contradictions; for, nothing but a firm persuasion that the terms of communion required are sinful and unlawful, could justify the one; and, this plainly condemns the other. The members who opposed the bill argued, That
<PB N="256" REF="2590"/>
the dissenters were generally well affected to the present constitution<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that to bring any real hardship upon them, or give ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to jealousies and fears at such a juncture, might be a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tended with dangerous consequences: that the toleration had greetly contributed to the security and reputation of the church, and plainly proved, that liberty of conscience and gentle measures were the most effectual means for increasing the votaries of the church, and diminishing the number of di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enters: that the dissenters could not be termed schi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>natics without bring∣ing an heavy charge upon the church of England, which had not only tolerated such schi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, but even allowed communion with the reformed churches abroad: that the penalties of this bill were more severe than those which the law imposed on papists, for assisting at the most solemn act of their religion: in a word, that toleration and tenderness had been always productive of peace and union, whereas persecution had never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ailed to excite discord and extend superstition. Many alterations and mitigations were proposed, without effect.

<P>The lords apprehensive, that the commons would tack it to some money-bill, voted, That the annexing any clause to a money-bill was contrary to the constitution of the English government, and the usage of parliament. The bill met with a very warm opposition in the upper house, where a con∣siderable portion of the Whig interest still remained. These members believed, that the intention of the bill was to model corporations, so as to eject all those who would not vote in elections for the Tories. Some imagined this was a preparatory step towards a repeal of the toleration; and, others concluded, that the promoters of the bill designed to raise such disturbances at home, as would discourage the allies abroad, and render the prosecution of the war impractica∣ble. The majority of the bishops, and among these Burnet of Sarum, objected against it on the principles of moderation, and from motives of conscience. Nevertheless, as the court supported this measure with its whole power and influ∣ence, the bill made its way through the house, tho' not without alterations and amendments, which were rejected by the commons. The lower house pre∣sended, that the lords had no right to alter any fines and penalties that the commons should <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix in bills sent up for their concurrence, on the supposition, that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se were matters concerning money, the peculiar province of the lower house: the lords ordered a minute inquiry to be made into all the rolls of par∣liament since the reign of the seventh Henry; and, a great number of instances were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound in which the lords had begun the clauses imposing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd pe∣nalties, altered the penalties which had been fixed by the commons, and even changed the uses to which they were applied. These precede<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es were entered in the books; but, the commons resolved to maintain their point without en∣gaging in any dispute upon the subject. After warm debates and a free confe∣nence between the two houses, the lords adhered to their amendments, though this resolution was carried by a majority of one vote only: the commons per∣sisted i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rejecting them; the bill miscarried; and, both houses published their proceedings by way of appeal to the nation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While this bill was depending, Daniel de Foe published a pamphlet, intit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led, <Q>“The short∣est way with the dissenters or, proposals for the establishment of the church.”</Q> The piece was a severe satire on the violence of the church∣party. The commons ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, and the au∣thor to be prosecuted. He was accordingly com∣mitted to Newgate, tried, condemned to pay a fine of two hundred pounds, and stand in the pil∣lory.</NOTE>. A bill was now brought into
<PB N="257" REF="2600"/>
the lower house, granting another year's consideration to those who had not taken the oath abjuring the pretended prince of Wales. The lords added three clauses, importing, That those persons who should take the oath within the limited time, might return to their benefices and employments, unless they should be already legally filled: that any person endeavouring to defeat the succession to the crown, as now limited by law, should be deemed guilty of high-treason: and, that the oath of abjuration should be imposed upon the sub∣jects in Ireland. The commons made some opposition to the first clause; but, at length, the question being put, Whether they should agree to the amend∣ments? it was carried in the affirmative by one voice.</P>

<P>No object engrossed more time, or produced more violent debates than did the inquiry into the public accounts. The commissioners appointed for this purpose, pretended to have made great discoveries. They changed the earl of Ranelagh, paymaster-general of the army, with flagrant mismanagement. He acquitted himself in such a manner as screened him from all severity of pu∣nishment; nevertheless, they expelled him from the house for a high crime and misdeamenour, in misapplying several sums of the public money; and, he thought proper to resign his employment. A long address was prepared and presented to the queen, attributing the national debt to the mismanagement of the funds; complaining, that the old methods of the exchequer had been ne∣glected: and, that iniquitous frauds had been committed by the commissioners of the prizes. Previous to this remonstrance, the house, in consequence of the report of the committee, had passed several severe resolutions, particularly, against Charles lord Hallifax, auditor of the receipt of the exchequer, as having neglected his duty, and been guilty of a breach of trust. For these rea∣sons, they actually besought the queen, in an address, that she would give direc∣tions to the attorney-general, to prosecute him for the said offences; and she promised to comply with their request. On the other hand, the lords appointed a committee to examine all the observations which the commissioners of accounts had offered to both houses. They ascribed the national debt to deficiencies in the funds: they acquitted lord Hallifax, the lords of the treasury, and their officers, whom the commons had accused: and, represented these circumstances in an address to the queen, which was afterwards printed with the vouchers to every particular. This difference blew up a fierce flame of discord between the two houses, which manifested their mutual animosity in speeches, votes, resolu∣tions, and conferences. The commons affirmed, That no cognizance the lords could take of the public accounts, would enable them to supply any deficiency, or appropriate any surplusage of the public money: that they could neither acquit or condemn any person whasoever, upon any inquiry arising originally in their own house: and, that their attempt to acquit Charles lord Hallifax was unparlia∣mentary. The lords insisted upon their right to take cognizance originally of all public accounts: they affirmed, that in their resolutions with respect to lord Hallifax, they had proceeded according to the rules of justice. They owned, however, that their resolutions did not amount to any judgment or acquittal;
<PB N="258" REF="2610"/>
but, that finding a vote of the commons reflected upon a member of their house, they thought fit to give their opinion in their legislative authority. The queen interposed by a message to the lords, desiring they would dispatch the bu∣siness in which they were engaged. The dispute continued even after this inti∣mation: one conference was held after another, till at length, both sides de∣spaired of an accommodation. The lords ordered their proceedings to be printed, and the commons followed their example. On the twenty-seventh day of February the queen having passed all the bills that were ready for the royal assent, ordered the lord-keeper to prorogue the parliament, after having pronounced a speech, in which she thanked them for their zeal, affection, and dispatch; declared, she would encourage and maintain the church as by law established; desired, they would consider some further laws for restraining the great licence assumed of publishing scandalous pamphlets and libels; and assured them, that all her share of the prizes which might be taken in the war, should be applied to the public service. By this time the earl of Rochester was intirely removed from the queen's councils. Finding himself out-weighed by the interest of the duke of Marlborough and lord Godolphin, he had become sullen and intractable; and, rather than repair to his government of Ireland, chose to resign the office, which, as we have already observed, was conferred upon the duke of Ormond, an accomplished nobleman, who had acquired great popula∣rity by the success of the expedition to Vigo. The parties in the house of lords were so nearly matched, that the queen, in order to ascertain an undoubted ma∣j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ity in the next session, created four new peers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were john Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ville, created b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ron Granville of Potheridge in the co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty of Devon; Heneage Finch, baron of Guernsey in the county of Southamp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>; Sir John Levison Gower<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> baron Gower of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttenham in Yorkshire; and Francis Seymo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Conway, youngest son of Sir Edward Seymour, made baron Conway of Ragley<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the county of Warwick.

<P>The two houses of convocation, which were summoned with the parliament, bore a strong affinity with this assembly, by the different interests that prevailed in the upper and lower. The last, in imitation of the commons, was des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous of branding the preceding reign; and, it was with great difficulty that they concurred with the prelates in an address of congratulation to her ma∣jesty. Then their former contest was revived. The lower house desired, in an application to the archbishop of Canterbury and his suffragans, that the matters in dispute co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cerning the manner of synodical proceedings, and the right of the lower house to hold intermediate assemblies, might be taken into consideration, and speedily determined. The bishops proposed, that in the intervals of sessions, the lower house might appoint committees to prepare matters; and when busi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess should be brought regularly before them, the archbishop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would regulate the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogations in such a manner, that they should have sufficient time to sit and deliberate on the subject. This offer did not satisfy the lower house<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which was emboldened to persist in its demand by a vote of the commons, who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in consequence of an address of thanks from the clergy, touching Mr. Loyd, son to the bishop of Worcester, whom they had ordered to be prosecuted after his priv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ege as member of the convocation should be expired, resolved<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That they
<PB N="259" REF="2620"/>
would on all occasions assert the just rights and privileges of the lower house of convocation. The prelates refused <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>part from the archbishop's right of proroguing the whole convocation with consent of his suffragans. The lower house proposed to refer the controversy to the queen's decision. The bishops declined this expedient, as inconsistent with the episcopal authority, and the pre∣sidency of the archbishop. The lower house having incurred the imputation of favouring presbytery, by this opposition to the bishops, entered in their books a declaration, acknowledging the order of bishops as superior to presbyters, and to be a divine apostolical institution. Then they desired the bishops, in an address, to concur in settling the doctrine of the divine apostolical right of episcopacy, that it might be a standing rule of the church. They likewise presented a petition to the queen, complaining, That in the convocation called in the year one thou∣sand seven hundred, after an interruption of ten years, several questions having arisen concerning the rights and liberties of the lower house, the bishops had re∣fused a verbal conference; and, afterwards declined a proposal to submit the dis∣pute to her majesty's determination: they therefore fled for protection to her majesty, begging she would call the question into her own royal audience. The queen promised to consider their petition, which was supported by the earl of Nottingham; and ordered their council to examine the affair, how it consisted with law and custom. Whether their report was unfavourable to the lower house, or the queen was unwilling to encourage the division, no other answer was made to their address. The archbishop replied to their request presented to the upper house, concerning the divine right of presbytery, that the preface to the form of ordination contained a declaration of three orders of ministers from the times of the apostles; namely, bishops, priests, and deacons, to which they had subscribed: but, he and his brethren conceived, that without a royal licence, they had not authority to attempt, enact, promulge, or execute any canon, which should concern either doctrine or discipline. The lower house answered this decl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration in very petulant terms; and, the dispute subsisted when the parliament was prorogued. But these contests produced divisions thro' the whole body of the clergy, who ranged themselves in different factions, dis∣tinguished by the names of High-church and Low-church. The first consisted of ecclesiastical Tories; and, the other included those who professed revolution principles, and recommended moderation towards the dissenters. The high∣church party reproached the other as time-servers, and presbyterians in disguise; and were in their turn stigmatized as the friends and abettors of tyranny and perfecution. At present, however, the Tories both in church and state trium∣phed in the favour of their sovereign. The right of parliaments, the memory of the late king, and even the act limiting the succession to the house of Hano∣ver, became the subjects of ridicule. The queen was flattered as possesson of the prerogatives of the antient monarchy: the history written by her grand∣father the earl of Clarendon was now for the first time published, to inculcate the principles of obedience, and inspire the people with an abhorrence of oppo∣sition to an anointed sovereign. Her majesty's hereditary right was deduced from Edward the confessor, and, as heir of his pretended fanctity and virtue, she was persuaded to touch persons afflicted with the king's evil, according to the office inserted in the liturgy for this occasion.</P>

<P>The change of the ministry in Scotland seemed favourable to the episcopalians and antire<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olutioners of that kingdom. The earls of March∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Melvil, Selkirk, Leven, and Hynford, were layed aside: the earl of Sea∣field was appointed chancellor; the duke of Queensberry, and the lord viscount Tarbat, were declared secretaries of state: the marquis of Annandale was made president of the council; and the earl of Tullibardin lord privy-seal. A new parliament having been summoned, the earl of Seafield employed his in∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence so s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ccessfully, that a great number of antirevolutioners was returned as members. The duke of Hamilton had obtained from the queen a letter to the privy-council in Scotland, in which she expressed her desire, that the pres∣by<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an clergy should live in brotherly love and communion with such dissent∣ing ministers of the reformed religion as were in possession of benefices, and lived with decency and submission to the law. The episcopal clergy, encouraged by these expressions in their favour, drew up an address to the queen, implor∣ing her protection; and, humbly beseeching her to allow those parishes in which there was a majority of episcopal freeholders, to bestow the benefice on minis∣ters of their principles. This petition was presented by Dr. Skeen and Dr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, who were introduced by the duke of Queensberry to her majesty. She assured them of her protection and endeavours to supply their necessities; and, ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted them to live in peace and christian love with the clergy, who were by law invested with the church-government in her ancient kingdom of Scotland. A proclamation of indemnity having been published in March, a great num∣ber of Jacobites returned from France and other countries, pretended to have changed their sentiments, and took the oaths, that they might be qualified to sit in parliament. They formed an accession to the strength of the antirevolu∣tioners and episcopalians, who now hoped to out-number the presbyterians, and<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Oldmixon. Torcy's Mem.

But, this confederacy was composed of dissonant parts, from which no harmony could be expected. The presbyterians and revolu∣tioners were headed by the duke of Argyle. The country<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>party of malcontents, which took its rise from the disappointments of the Darien settlement, acted under the auspices of the duke of Hamilton and marquis of Tweedale; and, the earl of Hume appeared as chief of the antirevolutioners. The different parties who now united, pursued the most opposite ends. The majority of the country-party were friends to the revolution, and sought only redress of the grievances which the nation had sustained in the late reign. The antirevolutioners consi∣dered the accession and government of king William as an extraordinary event which they were willing to forget, believing, that all parties were safe under the shelter of her majesty's general indemnity. The Jacobites submitted to the queen as tutrix or regent for the prince of Wales, whom they firmly believed she intended to establish on the throne. The Whigs under Argyle, alarmed at the coalition of all their enemies, resolved to procure a parliamentary sanction for the revolution.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1703.</NOTE> The parliament being opened on the sixth day of May at Edin∣burgh, by the duke of Queensberry as commissioner, the queen's letter was read, in which she demanded a supply for the maintenance of the forces, advised them to encourage trade, and exhorted them to proceed with wisdom, prudence, and unanimity. The duke of Hamilton immediately offered the draught of a
<PB N="261" REF="2640"/>
bill for recognizing her majesty's undoubted right and title to the imperial crown of Scotland, according to the declaration of the estates of the kingdom, con∣taining the claim of right. It was immediately received; and at the second reading, the queen's advocate offered an additional clause, denouncing the penal∣ties of treason against any person who should quarrel her majesty's right and title to the crown, or her exercise of the government from her actual entry to the same. This, after a long and warm debate, was carried by the concurrence of the antirevolutioners. Then the earl of Hume produced the draught of a bill for the supply; and immediately after it was read, the marquis of Tweedale made an overture, that before all other business, the parliament would proceed to make such conditions of government, and regulations in the constitution of the kingdom, to take place after the decease of her majesty and the heirs of her body, as should be necessary for the preservation of their religion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd liberty. This overture and the bill were ordered to lie upon the table; and, in the mean time, the commissioner found himself involved in great perplexity. The duke of Argyle, the marquis of Annandale, and the earl of Marchmont, gave him to understand in private, that they were resolved to move for an act, ratifying the revolution; and for another, confirming the presbyterian government: that they would insist upon their being discussed before the bill of supply: and, that they were certain of carrying the points at which they aimed. The commissioner now found himself reduced to a very disagreeable alternative. There was a ne∣cessity for relinquishing all hope of a supply, or abandoning the antirevolutio∣ners, to whom he was connected by promises of concurrence. The Whigs were determined to oppose all schemes of supply that should come from the cava∣liers: and, these last resolved to exert their whole power in preventing the con∣firmation of the revolution and the presbyterian discipline. He foresaw, that on this occasion the Whigs would be joined by the duke of Hamilton and his party, so as to preponderate against the cavaliers. He endeavoured to cajole both parties; but, found the task impracticable. He desired in parliament, that the act for the supply might be read, promising, that they should have full time afterwards to deliberate on other subjects. The marquis of Twee∣dale insisted upon his overture; and, after warm debates, the house resolved to proceed with such acts as might be necessary for securing the religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, before any bill for supply, or other business should be discussed. The marquis of Athol offered an act for the security of the king∣dom, in case of her majesty's decease; but, before it was read, the duke of Ar∣gyle presented his draught of a bill for ratifying the revolution, and all the acts following thereupon. An act for limiting the succession after the death of her majesty and the heirs of her body, was produced by Mr. Fletcher of Saltoun. The earl of Rothes recommended another, importing, that after her majesty's death, and failing heirs of her body, no person coming to the crown of Scotland, being at the same time king or queen of England, should, as king or queen of Scotland, have power to make peace or war without the consent of parliament. The earl of Marchmont recited the draught of an act for securing the true pro∣testant religion and presbyterian government; and, one was suggested by Sir Patrick Johnston, allowing the importation of wines and other foreign liquors. All these bills were ordered to lie upon the table. Then the earl of Strathmore produced an act for toleration to all protestants in the exercise of religious
<PB N="262" REF="2650"/>
worship. But against this the general assembly presented a most violent remon∣strance; and the promoters of the bill foreseeing that it would meet with great opposition, allowed it to drop for the present. On the third day of June, the parliament passed the act for preserving the true reformed protestant religion, and confirming presbyterian church-government, as agreeable to the word of God, and the only government of Christ's-church within the kingdom. The same party enjoyed a further triumph in the success of Argyle's act, for ratify∣ing and perpetuating the first act of king William's parliament; for declaring it high treason to disown the authority of that parliament; or to alter or innovate the claim of right, or any article thereof. This last clause was strenuously opposed; but at last the bill passed, with the concurrence of all the ministry, except the marquis of Athole and the viscount Tarbat, who began at this period to correspond with the opposite party.</P>

<P>The cavaliers thinking themselves betrayed by the duke of Queensberry, who had assented to these acts, first expostulated with him on his breach of promise, and then renounced his interest, resolving to separate from the court, and jointly pursue such measures as might be for the interest of their party. But of all the bills that were produced in the course of this remarkable session, that which produced the most violent altercation was the act of security, calculated to abridge the prerogative of the crown, limit the successor, and throw a vast additional power into the hands of the parliament. It was considered paragraph by paragraph: many additions and alterations were proposed, and some adopted: inflammatory speeches were uttered: bitter sarcasms retorted from party to party: and different votes passed on different clauses. At length, in spite of the most obstinate opposition from the ministry and the cavaliers, it was passed by a majority of fifty-nine voices. The com∣missioner was importuned to give it the royal assent; but declined answering their intreaties till the tenth day of September, when he made a speech in par∣liament, giving them to understand that he had received the queen's pleasure, and was empowered to give the royal assent to all the acts voted in this session, except to the act for the security of the kingdom. Then a motion was made, to sollicit the royal assent in an address to her majesty; but the question being put, it was carried in the negative by a small majority. On the sixth day of the same month, the earl of Marchmont had produced a bill to settle the suc∣cession on the house of Hanover. At first the import of it was not known; but, when the clerk, in reading it, mentioned the princess Sophia, the whole house was kindled into a flame. Some proposed that the overture should be burned: others moved that the earl might be sent prisoner to the castle; and a general dissatisfaction appeared in the whole assembly. Not that the ma∣jority in parliament were averse to the succession in the house of Hanover: but they resolved to avoid a nomination without stipulating conditions; and they had already provided<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the act of security, that it should be high-treason to own any person as king or queen after her majesty's decease, until he or she should take the coronation oath, and accept the terms of the claim of right, and such conditions as should be settled in this or any ensuing parliament.</P>

<P>Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, a man of undaunted courage and inflexible integrity, who professed republican principles, and seemed designed by nature as a member of some Grecian commonwealth, after having observed
<PB N="263" REF="2660"/>
that the nation would be enslaved, should it submit, either willingly or by commission, to the successor of England, without such conditions of govern∣ment as should secure them against the influence of an English ministry, offered the draught of an act, importing, That, after the decease of her majesty, without heirs of her body, no person being successor to the English throne, should succeed to the crown of Scotland, but under the following limitations, which, together with the coronation-oath and claim of right, they should swear to observe: namely, That all offices and places, civil and military, as well as pensions, should for the future be conferred by parliament to be chosen at every Michaelmas head-court, to sit on the first day of November, and ad∣journ themselves from time to time, till the ensuing Michaelmas: That they should chuse their own president: That a committee of six and thirty members, chosen out of the whole parliament, without distinction of estates, should, during the intervals of parliament, be vested under the king, with the admi∣nistration of the government, act as his council, be accountable to parli∣ament, and call it together on extraordinary occasions. He proposed that the successor should be nominated by the majority; declaring for himself, that he would rather concur in nominating the most rigid papist with those con∣ditions, than the truest protestant without them. The motion was seconded by many members; and though postponed for the present, in favour of an act of trade under the consideration of the house, it was afterwards resumed with great warmth. In vain the lord-treasurer represented, that no funds were as yet provided for the army, and moved for a reading of the act presented for that purpose: a certain member observed, that this was a very unseasonable juncture to propose a supply, when the house had so much to do for the se∣curity of the nation: he said they had very little encouragement to grant sup∣plies, when they found themselves frustrated of all their labour and expence for these several months; and, when the whole kingdom saw that supplies served for no other uses but to gratify the avarice of some insatiable ministers. Mr. Fletcher expatiated upon the good consequences that would arise from the act which he had proposed. The chancellor answered, That such an act was laying a scheme for a commonwealth, and tending to innovate the con∣stitution of the monarchy. The ministry proposed the state of a vote, whether they should first give a reading to Fletcher's act, or to the act of subsidy. The country party moved that the question might be, <Q>“Overtures for subsi∣dies, or overtures for liberty.”</Q> Fletcher withdrew his act, rather than people should pervert the meaning of laudable designs. The house resounded with the cry of "Liberty or subsidy." Bitter invectives were uttered against the ministry. One member said it was now plain the nation was to expect no other return for their expence and toil, than that of being loaded with a sub∣sidy, and being obliged to bend their necks under the yoke of slavery, which was prepared for them from that throne: another observed, that as their li∣berties were suppressed, so the privileges of parliament were like to be torn from them; but that he would venture his life in defence of his birthright, and rather die a free man than live a slave. When the vote was demanded, and declined by the commissioner, the earl of Roxburgh declared, that if there was no other way of obtaining so natural and undeniable a privilege of par∣liament, they would demand it with their swords in their hands. The com∣missioner
<PB N="264" REF="2670"/>
foreseeing this spirit of freedom and contradiction, had ordered the foot-guards to be in readiness, and placed a strong guard upon the eastern gate of the city. Notwithstanding these precautions, he ran the risque of being torn in pieces; and, in this apprehension, ordered the chancellor to inform the house, that the parliament should proceed upon overtures for liberty at their next sitting. This promise allayed the ferment, which had begun to rise. Next day the members prepared an overture, implying, That the elective mem∣bers should be chosen for every seat at the Michaelmas head-courts: That a parliament should be held once in two years at least: That the short adjourn∣ments de die in diem, should be made by the parliaments themselves, as in England; and, That no officer in the army, customs, or excise, nor any gra∣tuitous pensioner, should fit as an elective member. The commissioner being apprised of their proceedings, called for such acts as he was impowered to pass, and having given the royal assent to them, prorogued the parliament to the twelfth day of October<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though the queen refused to pass the act of security, the royal assent was granted to an act of limitation on the successor, in which it was de∣clared, that no king or queen of Scotland should have power to make war or peace without con∣sent of parliament. Another law was enacted, allowing French wines and other liquors to be imported in neutral bottoms. Without this ex¦pedient, it was alledged, that the revenue would have been insufficient to maintain the govern∣ment. An act passed in favour of the company trading to Africa and the Indies; another for a commission concerning the public accounts: a third for punishing slanderous speeches and writ∣ings. The commission for treating of an union with England was vacated, with a prohibition to grant any other commission for that purpose with∣out consent of parliament; and no supply having been provided before the adjournment, the army and expence of government were maintained upon credit.</NOTE>. Such was the issue of this remarkable session of the Scottish parliament, in which the duke of Queensberry was abandoned by the greatest part of the ministry; and such a spirit of ferocity and opposition pre∣vailed, as threatened the whole kingdom with civil war and confusion. The queen conferred titles upon those<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The marquis of Athol, and the marquis of Douglas, though a minor, were created dukes, lord Tarbat was invested with the title of earl of Cromarty; the viscounts of Stair and Roseberry were promoted to the same dignity.

<P>Ireland was filled with discontent, by the behaviour and conduct of the trustees for the forfeited estates. The earl of Rochester had contri∣buted to foment the troubles of the kingdom, by encouraging the factions which had been imported from England. The duke of Ormond was received with open arms, as heir to the virtues of his ancestors, who had been the bul∣warks of the protestant interest in Ireland. He opened the parliament on the twenty-first day of September, with a speech to both houses, in which he told them, that his inclination, his interest, and the examples of his progenitors, were indispensible obligations upon him, to improve every opportunity to the ad∣vantage and prosperity of his native country. The commons having chosen Allen Broderick to be their speaker, proceeded to draw up very affectionate addresses to the queen and the lord-lieutenant. In that to the queen they complained, that their enemies had misrepresented them, as desirous of being
<PB N="26$" REF="2680"/>
independent of the crown of England: they therefore, to vindicate themselves from such false aspersions, declared and acknowledged, that the kingdom of Ire∣land was annexed and united to the imperial crown of England. In order to ex∣press their hatred of the trustees, they resolved, That all the protestant free∣holders of that kingdom had been falsly and maliciously misrepresented, tra∣duced, and abused, in a book intituled, "The Report of the commissioners ap∣pointed to inquire into the Irish forfeitures;" and it appearing, that Francis Annesley member of the house, John Trenchard, Henry Langford, and James Hamilton, were authors of that book, they further resolved, That they had scandalously and maliciously misrepresented and traduced the protestant free∣holders of that kingdom, and endeavoured to create a misunderstanding and jealousy between the people of England and the protestants of Ireland. Annesley was expelled the house, Hamilton was dead, and Trenchard had re∣turned to England. They had finished the inquiry before the meeting of this parliament; and sold, at an under-value, the best of the forfeited estates to the sword-blade company of England, who, in a petition to the Irish parliament, prayed, that heads of a bill might be brought in for enabling them to take conveyances of lands in Ireland: but the parliament was very little disposed to confirm the bargains of the trustees, and the petition lay neglected on the table. The house expelled John Asgill, who, as agent to the sword-blade company, had offered to lend money to the public in Ireland, on condition that the parliament would pass an act to confirm the company's purchase of the forfeited estates. His constituents disowned his proposal; and, when he was summoned to appear before the house, and answer for his prevarication, he pleaded his privilege as member of the English parliament. The commons, in a representation of the state and grievances of the nation, gave her ma∣jesty to understand, that the constitution of Ireland had been of late greatly shaken; and their lives, liberties, and estates, called in question, and tried in a manner unknown to their ancestors: that the expence to which they had been unnecessarily exposed by the late trustees for the forfeited estates, in de∣fending their just rights and titles, had exceeded in value the current cash of the kingdom: that their trade was decayed, their money exhausted; and that they were hindered from maintaining their own manufactures: that many pro∣testant families had been constrained to quit the kingdom, in order to earn a livelihood in foreign countries: that the want of frequent parliaments in Ire∣land had encouraged evil-minded men to oppress the subject: That many civil officers had acquired great fortunes in that impoverished country, by the ex∣ercise of corruption and oppression: That others, in considerable employments, resided in another kingdom, neglecting personal attendance on their duty, while their offices were ill executed, to the detriment of the public, and the failure of justice. They declared, that it was from her majesty's gracious interposition alone, that they proposed to themselves relief from those their manifold groans and misfortunes. The commons afterwards voted the necessary supplies, and granted one hundred and fifty thousand pounds to make good the deficiencies of the necessary branches of the establishment.</P>

<P>They appointed a committee to inspect the public accounts, by which they discovered, that above one hundred thousand pounds had been falsly charged as a debt upon the nation. The committee was thanked by
<PB N="266" REF="2690"/>
the house for having saved this sum, and ordered to examine what persons were concerned in such a misrepresentation, which was generally imputed to those who acted under the duke of Ormond. He himself was a nobleman of honour and generosity, addicted to pleasure, and fond of popular applause: but he was surrounded by people of more sordid principles, who had ingratiated themselves into his confidence by the arts of adulation. The commons voted a provision for the half-pay officers; and abolished pensions to the amount of seventeen thousand pounds a year, as unnecessary branches of the establishment. They passed an act settling the succession of the crown, after the pattern set them by England: but the most important transaction of this session was a severe bill to prevent the growth of popery. It bore a strong affinity to that which had passed three years before in England; but contained more effectual clauses. Among others, it enacted, That all estates of papists should be equally divided among the children, notwithstanding any settlement to the contrary, unless the persons to whom they might be settled, should qualify themselves by taking the oaths, and communicating with the church of England. The bill was not at all agreeable to the ministry in England, who expected large presents from the papists, by whom a considerable sum had been actually raised for this purpose. But, as they did not think proper to reject such a bill while the English parliament was sitting, they added a clause which they hoped the par∣liament of Ireland would refuse; namely, that no persons in that kingdom should be capable of any employment, or of being in the magistracy of any city, who did not quality themselves by receiving the sacrament, according to the test-act passed in England. Though this was certainly a great hardship on the dissenters, the parliament of Ireland sacrificed this consideration to their common security against the roman catholics, and accepted the amendment without hesitation. This affair being discussed, the commons of Ireland passed a vote against a book intituled, "Memoirs of the late king James II." as a se∣ditious libel. They ordered it to be burned by the hands of the common hangman; and the bookseller and printer to be prosecuted. When this motion was made, a member informed the house, that in the county of Limerick the Irish papists had begun to form themselves into bodies; to plunder the protestants of their arms and money, and to maintain a correspondence with the disaffected in England. The house immediately resolved, That the papists of the kingdom still retained hopes of the accession of the person known by the name of the prince of Wales in the life-time of the late king James, and now by the name of James III. In the midst of this zeal against popery and the pretender, they were suddenly adjourned by command of the lord-lieutenant, and broke up in great animosity against that nobleman <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They had, besides the bills already men∣tioned, passed an act for an additional excise on beer, ale, and other liquors: another encourag∣ing the importation of iron and staves: a third for preventing popish priests from coming into the kingdom: a fourth securing the liberty of the subject, and for prevention of imprisonment be∣yond seas: and a fifth for naturalizing all protestant strangers.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>The attention of the English ministry had been for some time chiefly engrossed by the affairs of the continent. The emperor agreed with the allies, that his son the archduke Charles should assume the title of king of Spain, demand the infanta of Portugal in marriage, and undertake something
<PB N="267" REF="2700"/>
of importance, with the assistance of the maritime powers. Mr. Methuen, the English minister at Lisbon, had already made some progress in a a treaty with his Portuguess majesty; and the court of Vienna promised to send such an army into the field as would in a little time drive the elector of Bavaria from his dominions. But they were so dilatory in their preparations, that the French king broke all their measures, by sending powerful reinforcements to the elector, in whose ability and attachment Lewis reposed great confidence. Marechal Villars, who commanded an army of thirty thousand men at Stras∣burg, passed the Rhine, and reduced fort Kehl, the garrison of which was conducted to Philipsburgh. The emperor, alarmed at this event, ordered count Schlick to enter Bavaria on the side of Saltsburg, with a considerable body of forces; and sent another under count Stirum, to invade the same elec∣torate by the way of Newmark, which was surrendered to him, after he had routed a party of Bavarians: the city of Amberg me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the same fate. Mean while count Schlick defeated a body of militia that defended the lines of Saltsburg, and made himself master of Riedt, and several other places. The elector assembling his forces near Brenau, diffused a report that he intended to besiege Passau, to cover which place Schlick advanced with the greatest part of his infantry, leaving behind his cavalry and cannon. The elector having by this feint divided the Imperialists, passed the bridge of Scardigen with twelve thousand men, and, after an obstinate engagement, compelled the Imperialists to abandon the field of battle; then he marched against the Saxon troops which guarded the artillery, and attacked them with such impetuosity, that they were intirely defeated. In a few days after these actions, he took Newburg on the Inn by capitulation. He obtained another advantage over an advanced post of the Imperialists near Burgenfeldt, commanded by the young prince of Bran∣denburg Anspach, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. He ad∣vanced to Ratisbon, where the diet of the empire was assembled, and de∣manded that he should be immediately put in possession of the bridge and gate of the city. The burghers immediately took to their arms, and planted can∣non on the ramparts; but, when they saw a battery erected against them, and the elector determined to bombard the place, they thought proper to capitulate, and comply with his demands. He took possession of the town on the eighth day of April, and signed an instrument obliging himself to withdraw his troops, as soon as the emperor should ratify the diet's resolution for the neu∣trality of Ratisbon. Marechal Villars having received orders to join the elector at all events, and being reinforced by a body of troops under count Tallard, resolved to break through the lines which the prince of Baden had made at Stolhoffen. This general had been luckily joined by eight Dutch battalions, and received the French army, though double his number, with such obstinate resolution, that Villars was obliged to retreat with great loss, and directed his route towards Offingen. Nevertheless, he penetrated through the Black forest, and effected a junction with the elector. Count Stirum endeavoured to join prince Lewis of Baden; but being attacked near Schwemmingen, retired under the cannon of Nortlingen.</P>

<P>The confederates were more successful on the Lower Rhine and in the Netherlands. The duke of Marlborough crossed the sea in the beginning of April, and assembling the allied army, resolved, that the cam∣paign
<PB N="268" REF="2710"/>
should be begun wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h the siege of Bonne, which was accordingly invested on the twenty-fourth day of April. Three different attacks were carried on against this place; one by the hereditary prince of Hesse-Cassel; another by the celebrated Co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>horn; and a third by the lieutenant-general Fagel. The gar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ison defended themselves vigorously till the fourteenth day of May, when the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort having been taken by assault, and the breaches practicable, the mar∣quis d'Alegre the governor, ordered a parley to be beat; hostages were im∣mediately exchanged; on the sixteenth the capitulation was signed; and in three days the garrison evacuated the place, in order to be conducted to Luxemburg. During the siege of Bonne, the marechals Boufflers and Villeroy advanced with an army of forty t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ousand men towards Tongeren, and the confederate army commanded by Overkirk was obliged at their approach to retreat under the cannon of Maestricht. The enemy having taken possession of Tongeren, made a motion against the confederate army, which they found already drawn up in order of battle, and so advantageously posted, that, notwithstanding their great superiori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in point of number, they would not hazard an attack; but retired to the ground from whence they had advanced. Immediately after the reduction of Bonne, the duke of Marlborough, who had been present at the siege, returned to the confederate army in the Netherlands, now amount∣ing to one hundred and thirty squad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons, and fifty-nine battalions. On the twenty fifth day of May, the duke having passed the river Jecker, in ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r to give battle to the enemy, they marched with precipitation to Boekwern, and abandoned Tongeren, after having blown up the walls of the place with gunpowder. The duke continued to follow them to Thys, where he encamped, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le they retreated to Hannye, retiring as he advanced. Then he resolved to force their lines; and this service was effectually performed by Coehorn, at the point of Callo, and by baron Spaar in the county of Waes, near Stoken. The duke had formed the design of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>educing Antwerp, which was garrisoned by Span<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h troops, under the command of the marquis de Bedmar. He in∣tended with the grand army to attack the enemy's lines on the side of Lou∣vaine and Mechlin, while he detached Coehorn with his flying camp on the right of the Scheld, towards Dutch Flanders, to amuse the marquis de Bedmar on that side; and he ordered the baron Opdam with twelve thousand men to take post between Eckeren and Capelle near Antwerp, that he might act against that part of the lines which was guarded by the Spanish forces.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The French generals, in order to frustrate the scheme of Marlborough, resolved to cut off the retreat of Opdam. Boufflers, with a de∣tachment of twenty thousand men from Villeroy's army, surprised him at Eckeren, where the Dutch were put in disorder; and Opdam believing all was lost, fled to Bred<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Nevertheless, the troops ral<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder general Schlan∣genburg, maintained their ground with the most obstin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>te valour, till night, when the enemy was obliged to retire, and left the communication free with fort Lillo, to which place the confederates marched without further molestation, having lost about fifteen hundred men in the engagement. The damage sustained by the French was more considerable. They were frustrated in their design, and had actually abandoned the field of battle; yet Lewis ordered Te Deum to be sung for the victory: nevertheless, Bouf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lers was censured for his conduct on this occasion, and in a little time totally disgraced. Opdam
<PB N="26$" REF="2720"/>
presented a justification of his conduct to the states-general; but by this over∣sight forfeited the fruits of a long service, during which he had exhibited re∣peated proofs of courage, zeal, and capacity. The states honoured Schlan∣genburg with a letter of thanks for the valour and skill he had manifested in this engagement; but, in a little time they dismissed him from his employ∣ment, on account of his having given umbrage to the duke of Marlborough, by censuring his grace for exposing such a small number of men to this disaster. After this action Villeroy, who lay encamped near St. Job, declared he would wait for the duke of Marlborough, who forthwith advanced to Hoogstraat with a view to give him battle: but, at his approach, the French general setting fire to his camp, retired within his lines with great precipitation. Then the duke invested Huy, the garrison of which, after a vigorous defence, surrendered themselves prisoners of war, on the twenty-seventh day of August. At a council of war held in the camp of the confederates, the duke proposed to attack the enemy's lines between the Mehaigne and Leuwe, and was seconded by the Danish, Hanoverian, and Hessian generals; but the scheme was op∣posed by the Dutch officers and the deputies of the states, who alledged that the success was dubious, and the consequences of forcing the lines inconsider∣able. They therefore recommended the siege of Limburg, by the reduction of which they would acquire a whole province, and cover their own country, as well as Juliers and Gueldres, from the designs of the enemy. The siege of Limburg was accordingly undertaken. The trenches were opened on the five and twentieth day of September, and in two days the place was surrendered; the garrison remaining prisoner of war. By this conquest the allies secured the country of Liege, and the electorate of Cologne, from the incursions of the ene∣my; and before the end of the year, they remained masters of the whole Spanish Guelderland, by the reduction of Gueldres, which surrendered on the seventeenth day of September, after having been long blockaded, bombarded, and re∣duced to a heap of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes, by the Prussian general Lottum. Such was the campaign in the Netherlands, which in all probability would have produced events of greater importance, had not the duke of Marlborough been re∣stricted by the deputies of the states-general, who began to be influenced by the intrigu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the Louvestein faction, ever averse to a single dictator.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The French king redoubled his efforts in Germany. The duke of Vendome was ordered to march from the Milanese to Tyrol, and there join the el<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctor of Bavaria, who had already made himself master of Inspruck. But the boors rising in arms, drove him out of the country before he could be joined by the French general, who was therefore obliged to return to the Mi∣lanese. The Imperialists in Italy were so ill supplied by the court of Vienna, that they could not pretend to act offensively. The French invested Ostiglia, which, however, they could not reduce: but the fortress of Barsillo, in the dutchy of Reggio, capitulating after a long blockade, they took possession of the duke of Modena's country. The elector of Bavaria rejoining Villars, re∣solved to attack count Stirum, whom prince Lewis of Baden had detached from his army. With this view they passed the Danube at Donawert, and dis∣charged six guns as a signal for the marquis D'Usson, whom they had left in the camp at Lavingen, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all upon the rear of the Imperialists, while they should charge them in front. Stirum no sooner perceived the signal, than he guessed the intention of the enemy, and instantly resolved to attack D'Usson before
<PB N="270" REF="2730"/>
the elector and the marechal should advance. He accordingly charged him at the head of some select squadrons, with such impetuosity that the French cavalry was totally defeated; and all his infantry would have been killed and taken, had not the elector and Villars come up in time to turn the fate of the battle, which continued from six in the morning to four in the afternoon, when Stirum being overpowered by numbers, was obliged to retreat to Norlingen with the loss of twelve thousand men, and all his baggage and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tillery. In the mean time, the duke of Burgundy, assisted by Tallard, undertook the siege of Old Brisac, with a prodigious train of artillery. The place was very strongly for∣tified, though the garrison was small and ill provided with necessaries. In four∣teen days, the governor surrendered the place, and was condemned to lose his head for having made such a slender defence. The duke of Burgundy returned in triumph to Versailles, and Tallard was ordered to invest Landau. The prince of Hesse-Cassel being detached from the Netherlands for the relief of the place, joined the count of Nassau-Wellburg general of the Palat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne forces, near Spires, where they resolved to attack the French in their lines. But by this time mon∣sie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Pracontal with ten thousand men had joined Tallard, and enabled him to strike a stroke which proved decisive. He suddenly quitted his lines, and sur∣prised the prince at Spirebach, where the French obtained a complete victory, after a very obstinate and bloody engagement, in which the prince of Hesse distinguished himself by uncommon marks of courage and presence of mind. Three horses were successively killed under him, and he slew a French officer with his own hand. After incredible efforts, he was sain to retreat with the loss of some thousands. The French payed dear for their victory, Pracontal having been slain in the action. Nevertheless, they resumed the siege, and the place was surrendered by capitulation. The campaign in Germany was finished with the reduction of Augsburg by the elector of Bavaria, who took it in the month of December, and agreed to its being secured by a French garrison.</P>

<DIV4 N="40" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XL.</HEAD>
<P>The emperor's affairs at this juncture wore a very unpromising aspect. The Hungarians were fleeced and barbarously oppressed by those to whom he intrusted the government of their country. They derived courage from des∣pair. They seized this opportunity when the emperor's forces were divided, and his councils distracted, to exert themselves in defence of their liberties. They ran to arms under the auspices of prince Ragotzki. They demanded that their grievances should be redressed, and their privileges restored. Their resentment was kept up by the emissaries of France and Bavaria, who likewise encouraged them to persevere in their revolt, by repeated promises of protection and assistance. The emperor's prospect, however, was soon mended by two incidents of very great consequence to his interest. The duke of Savoy foreseeing how much he would lie exposed to the mercy of the French king, should that monarch become master of the Milanese, engaged in a secret nego∣tiation with the emperor, which, notwithstanding all his caution, was dis∣covered by the court of V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rsailles. Lewis immediately ordered the duke of Vendome to disarm the troops of Savoy that were in his army, to the number of two and twenty thousand men: to insist upon the duke's putting him in possession of four considerable fortresses; and demand that the number of his troops should be reduced to the establishment stipulated in the treaty of one thousand six hundred and ninety-six. The duke, exasperated at these insults, ordered the French ambassador, and several officers of the same
<PB N="271" REF="2740"/>
nation, to be arrested; and Lewis endeavoured to intimidate him by a me∣nacing letter, in which he gave him to understand, that since neither religion, honour, interest, nor alliances, had been able to influence his conduct, the duke of Vendome should make known the intentions of the French mo∣narch, and allow him four and twenty hours to deliberate on the measures he should pursue. This letter was answered by a manifesto: in the mean time the duke concluded a treaty with the court of Vienna; acknowledged the archduke Charles as king of Spain; and sent envoys to England and Holland. Queen Anne knowing his importance, as well as his selfish disposition, assured him of her friendship and assistance; and both she and the states sent ambassadors to Turin. He was immediately joined by a body of Imperial horse under Visconti, and afterwards by count Staremberg, at the head of fifteen thousand men, with whom he marched from the Modenese in the worst season of the year, through an enemy's country, and roads that were deemed impassable, while the French forces harrassed him in his march, and even surrounded him in many different places on the route. He surmounted all these difficulties with incredible courage and perseverance, and joined the duke of Savoy at Ca∣nelli, so as to secure the country of Piedmont. The other incident which proved so favourable to the Imperial interest, was a treaty by which the king of Por∣tugal acceded to the grand alliance. His ministry perceived, that should Spain be once united to the crown of France, their master would sit very insecure upon his throne. They were intimidated by the united fleets of the maritime powers, which maintained the empire of the sea; and they were allured by the splendor of a match between their infanta and the archduke Charles, to whom the emperor and the king of the Romans should transfer all their pretensions to the Spanish crown. By this treaty, concluded at Lifbon, between the em∣peror, the queen of Great Britain, the king of Portugal, and the states-ge∣neral, it was stipulated, That king Charles should be conveyed to Portugal by a powerful fleet, having on board twelve thousand soldiers, with a great supply of money, arms, and ammunition; and that he should be joined immediately upon his landing, by an army of eight and twenty thousand Portuguese.</P>

<P>The confederates reaped very little advantage from the naval ope∣rations of this summer. Sir George Rooke cruised in the channel, in order to alarm the coast of France, and protect the trade of England. On the first day of July, Sir Cloudesley Shovel sailed from St. Helen's, with the combined squadrons of England and Holland: he directed his course to the Mediter∣ranean, and being reduced to great difficulty by want of water, steered to Altea on the coast of Valentia, where brigadier Seymour landed and encamped with five and twenty hundred marines. The admiral published a short manifesto, signisying that he was not come to disturb, but to protect the good subjects of Spain, who should swear allegiance to their lawful monarch the archduke Charles, and endeavour to shake off the yoke of France. This declaration produced little or no effect; and the fleet being watered, sailed to Leghorn. One design of this armament was to assist the Cevennois, who had in the course of the preceding year been persecuted into a revolt on account of religion, and implored the assistance of England and the states-general. The admiral de∣tached two ships into the gulph of Narbo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne with some refugees and French pilots, who had concerted signals with the Cevennois; but the marechal de
<PB N="272" REF="2750"/>
Montrevil having received intimation of their design, took such measures as prevented all communication; and the English captains having repeated their signals to no purpose, rejoined Sir Cloudesley at Leghorn. This admiral having renewed the peace with the pyratical states of Barbary, returned to England, without having taken one effectual step for annoying the enemy, or attempted any thing that looked like the result of a concerted scheme for that purpose. The nation naturally murmured at this fruitless expedition, by which it had incurred such a considerable expence. The merchants complained that they were ill supplied with convoys. The ships of war were victualled with damaged provision; and every article of the marine being mismanaged, the blame fell upon those who acted as council to the lord high-admiral.</P>

<P>Nor were the arms of England by sea much more successful in the West Indies. Sir George Rooke, in the preceding year, had detached from the Mediterranean captain Hovenden Walker with six ships of the line and transports, having on board four regiments of soldiers, for the Leewardislands. Being joined at Antigua by some troops under colonel Coddrington, they made a descent upon the island Guadaloupe, where they razed the fort, burned the town, ravaged the country, and reimbarked with precipitation, in consequence of a report that the French had landed nine hundred men on the back of the is<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and. They retired to Nevis, where they must have perishe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by famine, had not they been provi∣dentially relieved by vice-admiral Graydon, in his w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to Jamaica. This officer had been sent out with three s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ips to succ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nbow, and was con∣voyed about one hundred and fifty leagues by two other ships of the line. He had not failed many days, when he fell in with part of the French squadron commanded by Du Casse, on their return from the Wes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indies, very foul and richly laden. Captain Cleland of the Montague engaged the sternmost; but he was called off by a signal from the admiral, who proceeded on his voyage without taking farther notice of the enemy. When he arrived at Jamaica, he quarrelled with the principal planters of the island; and his ships beginning to be crazy, he resolved to return to England. He accordingly sailed through the gulph of Florida, with a view to attack the French at Placentia, in New∣foundland; but his ships were dispersed in a fog that lasted thirty days; and afterwards the council of war which he convoked were of opinion, that he could not attack the settlement with any prospect of success. At his return to England, the house of lords then sitting set on foot an inquiry into his conduct. They presented an address to the queen, desiring she would remove him from his employments; and he was accordingly dismissed. The only exploit that tended to the distress of the enemy, was performed by rear-admiral Dilkes, who, in the month of July, sailed to the coast of France with a small squadron; and, in the neighbourhood of Granville, took or destroyed about forty ships and their convoy. Yet this damage was inconsiderable when com∣pared to that which the English navy sustained from the dreadful tempest that began to blow on the twenty-seventh day of November, accompanied with such flashes of lightening, and peals of thunder, as overwhelmed the whole kingdom with consternation. The houses in London shook from their foundations, and some of them falling, buried the inhabitants in their ruins. The water over∣flowed several streets, and rose to a considerable tide in Westminster-hall. London-bridge was almost choaked up with the wrecks of vessels that perished
<PB N="273" REF="2760"/>
in the river. The loss sustained by the capital was computed at a million ster∣ling; and the city of Bristol suffered to a prodigious amount: but the chief na∣tional damage fell upon the navy. Thirteen ships of war were lost, together with fifteen hundred seamen, including rear-admiral Beaumont, who had been employed in observing the Dunkirk squadron, and was then at anchor in the Downs, where his ship foundered. This great loss, however, was repaired with incredible diligence, to the astonishment of all Europe. The queen imme∣diately issued orders for building a greater number of ships than that which had been destroyed; and she exercised her bounty for the relief of the shipwrecked seamen, and the widows of those who were drowned, in such a manner as en∣deared her to all her subjects.</P>

<P>The emperor having declared his second son Charles king of Spain, that young prince set out from Vienna to Holland, and at Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eldorp was visited by the duke of Marlborough, who, in the name of his mist<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess, congratulated him upon his accession to the crown of Spain. Charles received him with the most obliging courtesy. In the course of their conversation, taking off his sword, he presented it to the English general, with a very gra∣cious aspect, saying, in the French language, <Q>“I am not ashamed to own my∣self a poor prince. I possess nothing but my cloak and sword: the latter may be of use to your grace; and I hope you will not think it the worse for my wearing it one day.”</Q> <Q>“On the contrary (replied the duke) it will al∣ways put me in mind of your majesty's just right and title, and of the ob∣ligations I lie under to hazard my life in making you the greatest prince in Christendom.”</Q> This nobleman returned to England in October; and king Charles embarking for the same kingdom, under convoy of an English and Dutch squadron, arrived at Spithead on the twenty-sixth day of September. There he was received by the dukes of Somerset and Marlborough, who con∣ducted him to Windsor; and on the road he was met by prince George of Denmark. The queen's deportment towards him was equally noble and oblig∣ing; and he expressed the most profound respect and veneration for this il∣lustrious princess. He spoke but little; yet what he said was judicious; and he behaved with such politeness and affability as conciliated the affection of the English nobility. After having been magnificently entertained for three days, he returned to Portsmouth, from whence, on the fourth of January, he sailed for Portugal, with a great fleet, commanded by Sir George Rooke, having on board a body of land-forces under the duke of Schomberg. When the admiral had almost reached cape Finisterre, he was driven back by a storm to Spithead, where he was obliged to remain to the middle of February. Then being favoured with a fair wind, he happily performed the voyage to Lisbon, where king Charles was received with great splendour, though the court of Portugal was over∣spread with sorrow, excited by the death of the infanta, whom the king of Spain intended to espouse. In Poland, all hope of peace seemed to vanish. The cardinal-primate, by the instigation of the Swedish king, whose army lay encamped in the neighbourhood of Dantzick, assembled a diet at Warsaw, which solemnly deposed Augustus, and declared the throne vacant. Their in∣tention was to elect young Sobieski, son of their late monarch, who resided at Bresl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w in Silesia: but their scheme was anticipated by Augustus, who retired hastily into his Saxon dominions, and seizing Sobies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i with his brother, secured th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m as prisoners at Dresden.</P>

Notwithstanding this admo∣nition, and the addresses of both houses, in which they promised to avoid all divisions, a motion was made in the house of commons for renewing the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l against occasional conformity; and carried by a great majority. In the new draught, however, the penalties were lowered, and the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t clauses mitigated. As the court no longer interested itself in the success of this measure, the house was pretty equally divided with respect to the speakers, and the debates on each side were maintained with equal s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irit and ability: at length, it pasied<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and was sent up to the lords, who handled it full more severely. It was opposed by a small majority of the bishops, and particularly, by Burnet of Sarum, who de∣claimed against it as a scheme of the papists, to set the church and protestants at variance. It was successively att<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cked by the duke of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vonshire, the earl of Pembroke, the lords Haversham, Mohun, Ferrars, and Wharton. Prince George of Denmark absented himself from the house: and, the question being put for a second reading, it was carried in the negative; yet, the duke of Marlborough and lord Godolphin entered their diss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt against its being rejected, though the former had positively declared, that he thought the bill unseasonable. The commons having perused a copy of the treaty with Portugal, voted forty thou∣sand men, including five thousand marines, for the sea-service of the ensuing year; a like number of land forces, to act in conjunction with the allies, besides the additional ten thousand; and, they resolved, That the proportion to be employed in Portugal should amount to eight thousand. Sums were granted for the maintenance of these great armaments, as well as for the subsiates payable to her majesty's allies; and funds appointed equal to the occasion. Then they assured the queen, in an address, that they would provide for the support of such alliances as she had made, or should make with the duke of Savoy.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>At this period the nation was alarmed by the detection of a conspiracy said to be hatched by the Jacobites of Scotland. Simon Fraser lord Lova<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, a man of desperate enterprize, profound dissimulation, abandoned morals, and ruined fortune, who had been outlawed for having ravished a sister of the mar∣quis of Athol, was the person to whom the plot seems to have owed its origin. He repaired to the court of St. Germain's, where he undertook to assemble a body of twelve thousand Highlanders to act in favour of the pretender, if the court of France would assist them with a small reinforcement of troops, toge∣ther with officers, arms, ammunition, and money. The French king seemed to listen to the proposal; but, as Fraser's character was infamous, he doubted his veracity. He was, therefore, sent back to Scotland with two other persons, who were instructed to learn the strength and sentiments of the clans, and en∣deavour to engage some of the nobility in the design of an insurrection. Fraser no sooner returned than he privately discovered the whole transaction to the duke of Queensberry, and undertook to make him acquainted with the whole correspondence between the pretender and the Jacobites. In consequence of this service he was provided with a pass, to secure him from all prosecution; and made a progress through the Highlands, to found the inclination of the chief∣tains.
<PB N="276" REF="2790"/>
Before he set but on this circuit, he delivered to the duke a letter from the queen dowager at St. Germain's, directed to the marquiss of Athol: it was douched in general terms, and superscribed in a different character; so that in all probability. Fraser had forged the direction, with a view to ruin the marquis, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> him for the injury done to his sister. He proposed a second journey to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where he should be able to discover other more ma∣terial <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Queensburry procured a pass for him to go to Holland from the earl of Nottingham, though it was expedited under a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had communicated his discovery to the queen, with∣out <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his name, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> might be concealed; and, her majesty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the particulars, which were confirmed by her spies at Paris, as well as by the evidence of Sir John Maclean, who had lately been conveyed from France to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agland in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and apprehended at Folkstone. This gentleman pretended at first, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was to go thro' England to his own country, in order to take the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Queen's pardon; and, this, in all probability, was his real design; but, being given to understand, that he would be treated in Eng∣land as a traitor, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e should merit forgiveness by making important dis∣coveries, he related all he knew of the purposed insurrection. From his infor∣mation the ministry gave direction, for apprehending one Keith, whose uncle had accompanied Fraser from France, and knew all the intrigues of the court of St. Germain's. He declared, that there was no other design a-foot, except that of paving the way for the pretender's ascending the throne after the queen's decease. Fergusor, that veteran conspirator, affirmed, that Fraser had been employed by the duke of Queensberry to decoy some persons whom he hate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> into a conspiracy, that he might have an opportunity to effect their ruin; and, by the discovery establish his own credit, which began to totter. Perhaps, there was too much reason for this imputation. Among those who were seized at this time, was a gentleman of the name of Linasay, who had been under-secretary to the earl of Middleton. He had returned from France to Scotland, in order to take the benefit of the queen's pardon, under the shelter of which he came to England, thinking himself secure from prosecution. He protested, he knew of no designs against the queen or her government; and, that he did not believe she would ever receive the least injury or molestation from the court of St. Germain's. The house of lords having received intimation of this con∣spiracy, resolved, That a committee should be appointed to examine into the particulars; and, ordered, That Sir John Maclean should be next day brought to their house. The queen, who was far from being pleased with this instance of their officious interposition, gave them to understand by message, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e thought it would be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to change the method of examination <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ready begun; and, that she would in a short time inform the house of the whole affair. On the seventeenth day of December the queen went to the house of peers, and having passed the bill for the land-tax, made a speech to both houses, in which she declared, that she had unquestionable information of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l practices and designs carried on by the emissaries of France in Scotland. The lords persisting in their resolution to bring the inquiry into their own house, chose their select committee by ballot; and, in an address thanked her majesty for the information she had been pleased to communicate.</P>

<P>The commons taking it for granted, that the queen was disobliged at these proce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ings of the upper house, which indeed implied an insult upon her
<PB N="277" REF="2800"/>
ministry, if not upon herself, presented an address, declaring themselves surprised to find, that when persons suspected of treasonable practices were taken into cus∣tody by her majesty's messengers, in order to be examined, the lords, in viola∣tion to the known laws of the land, had wrested them out of her hands, and ar∣rogated the examination solely to themselves; so that a due inquiry into the evil practices and designs against her majesty's person and government might in a great measure be obstructed. They earnestly desired, that she would suffer no diminution of the prerogative; and, they assured her they would, to the utmost of their power, support her in the exercise of it at home, as well as in asserting it against all invasions whatsoever. The queen thanked them for their concern and assurances; and, was not ill pleased at the nature of the address, though the charge against the peers was not strictly true: for, there were many instances of their having assumed such a right of inquiry. The upper house deeply re∣sented the accusation. They declared, that by the known laws and customs of parliament, they had an undoubted right to take examinations of persons charged with criminal matters, whether those persons were or were not in custody. They resolved, That the address of the commons was unparliamentary, ground∣less, without precedent, highly injurious to the house of peers, tending to inter∣rupt the good correspondence between the two houses, to create an ill opinion in her majesty of the house of peers, of dangerous consequence to the liberties of the people, the constitution of the kingdom, and privileges of parliament. They presented a long remonstrance to the queen, justifying their own conduct, explaining the steps they had taken, recriminating upon the commons; and, expressing the most servent zeal, duty, and affection to her majesty. In her answer to this representation, which was drawn up with elegance, propriety, and precision, she professed her sorrow for the misunderstanding which had happened between the two houses of parliament, and thanked them for the concern they had expressed for the rights of the crown and the prerogative, which she should never exert so willingly as for the good of her subjects, and the protection of their liberties.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Among other persons seized on the coast of Sussex, on their landing from France, was one Boucher, who had been aid-du-camp to the duke of Ber∣wick. When examined, he denied all knowledge of any conspiracy; and said, that being weary of living so long abroad, and having made some unsuccessful attempts to obtain a pass, he had chosen rather to cast himself on the queen's mercy, than to remain longer in exile from his native country. He was tried and condemned for high-treason, yet continued to declare himself ignorant of the plot. He proved, that in the war of Ireland as well as in Flanders, he had treated the English prisoners with great humanity. The lords desisted from the prosecution; he obtained a reprieve, and died in Newgate. On the twenty∣ninth day of January the earl of Nottingham told the house, that the queen had commanded him to lay before them the papers containing all the particu∣lars hitherto discovered of the conspiracy in Scotland; but, that there was one circumstance which could not yet be properly communicated, without running the risque of preventing a discovery of greater importance. They forthwith drew up and presented an address, desiring, that all the papers might be immediately submitted to their inspection. She said, she did not expect to be pressed in this manner immediately after the declaration she had made; but, in a few days the
<PB N="278" REF="2810"/>
earl of Nottingham delivered the papers sealed to the house, and all the lords were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ummened to attend on the eighth day of February, that they might be opened and perused. Nottingham was suspected of a design to sti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le the conspi∣ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Complaint was made in the house of commons, that he had discharged an officer belonging to the late king James, who had been seized by the gover∣nor of Berwick. A warm debate ensued, and at length ended in a resolve, That the earl of Nottingham, one of her majesty's principal secretaries of state, for his great ability and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iligence in the execution of his office, for his unquestionable fide<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty to the queen and her government, and for his steady adhering to the church of England as by law established, highly merited the trust her majesty had reposed in him. They ordered the speaker to present this resolution to the queen, who said, she was glad to find them so well satisfied with the earl of Nottingham, who was trusted by her in so considerable an office. They perused the examination of the witnesses which were layed before them, without passing judgment or offering advice on the subject; but, they thanked her majesty for having communicated those particulars, as well as for her wisdom and care of the nation. When the lords proceeded with uncommon eagerness in their in∣quity, the lower house, in another address, renewed their complaints against the conduct of the peers, which they still affirmed was without a precedent. But, this was the language of irritated faction, by which indeed both sides were equally actuated.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The select committee of the lords prosecuted the inquiry, and founded their report chiefly on the confession of Sir John Maclean, who owned, that the court of St. Germain's had listened to Lovat's proposal: that several councils had been held at the pretender's court on the subject of an invasion; and, per∣sons sent over to sound some of the nobility in Scotland. But, the nature of their private correspondence and negotiation could not be discovered. Keith had tampered with his uncle to disclose the whole secret; and, this was the circumstance which the queen declined imparting to the lords, until she should know the success of his endeavours, which proved ineffectual. The uncle stood aloof; and, the ministry did not heartily engage in the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiry. The house of lords having finished these examinations, and being warmed with violent de∣bates, voted, That there had been dangerous plots between some persons in Scotland and the courts of France and St. Germain's: and, That the encou∣ragement for this plotting arose from the not settling the succession to the crown of Scotland in the house of Hanover. These votes were signified to the queen in an address; and, they promised, that when the succession should be thus set∣tled, they would endeavour to promote the union of the two kingdoms upon just and reasonable terms. Then they composed another representation, in an∣swer to the second address of the commons, touching their proceedings. They charged the lower house with want of zeal in the whole progress of this inquiry. They produced a great number of precedents, to prove that their con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uct had been regular and parliamentary; and they, in their turn, accused the commons of part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and injustice in vacating legal elections. The queen, in answer to this remonstrance, said, she looked upon any misunderstanding be∣tween the two houses as a very great mis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortune to the kingdom: and, that she should never omit any thing in her power to prevent all occasions of them for the future.</P>

<P>The lords and commons, animated by such opposite principles, seized every opportunity of thwarting each other. An action having been brought by one Matthew Ashby against William White and the other constables of Aylesbury, for having denied him the privilege of voting in the last election, the cause was tried at the assizes, and the constables were cast with damages. But, an order was given in the queen's bench to quash all the proceedings, since no action had ever been brought on that account. The cause being moved by writ of error into the house of lords, was argued with great warmth; at length, it was carried by a great majority, that the order of the queen's-bench should be s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t aside, and judgment pronounced according to the verdict given at the assizes. The commons considered these proceedings as encroachments on their privileges. They passed five different resolutions, importing, That the com∣mons of England in parliament assembled had the sole right to examine, and determine all matters relating to the right of election of their own members: That the practice of determining the qualifications of electors in any court of law, would expose all mayors, bailiffs, and returning-officers, to a multiplicity of vexatious suits, and insupportable expences, and subject them to different and independent jurisdictions, as well as to inconsistent determinations in the same case, without relief: That Matthew Ashby was guilty of a breach of privilege, as were all attornies, sollicitors, counsellors, and serjeants at law, solli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iting, pro∣secuting, or pleading, in any case of the same nature. These resolutions, signed by the clerk, were fixed upon the gate of Westminster-hall. On the other hand, the lords appointed a committee to draw up a state of the case; and, upon their report, resolved, That every person being wilfully hindered to exer∣cise his right of voting, might maintain an action in the queen's courts against the officer by whom his vote should be refused, to assert his right, and recover damage for the injury: That an assertion to the contrary was destructive of the property of the subjects, against the freedom of elections, and manifestly tended to the encouragement of partiality and corruption: That the declaring Matthew Ashby guilty of a breach of privilege of the house of commons, was an un∣precedented attempt upon the judicature of parliament, and an attempt to sub∣ject the law of England to the votes of the house of commons. Copies of the case, and these resolutions, were by the lord keeper sent to all the sheriffs of Eng∣land, to be circulated through all the boroughs of their respective counties.</P>

<P>On the seventh day of February the queen ordered secretary Hedges to tell the house of commons, that she had remitted the arrears of the tenths to the poor clergy: that she would grant her whole revenue arising out of the first∣fruits and tenths, as far as it should become free from incumbrance, as an aug∣mentation of their maintenance: and, that if the house of commons could find any method by which her intentions to the poor clergy might be made more effectual, it would be an advantage to the public, and acceptable to her majesty. The commons immediately brought in a bill, enabling her to alienate this branch of the revenue, and create a corporation by charter, to direct the ap∣plication of it to the uses proposed: they likewise repealed the statute of Mort∣main, so far as to allow all men to bequeath by will, or grant by deed, any sum they should think fit to give towards the augmentation of benefices. Addresses of thanks and acknowledgment from all the clergy of England were presented to the queen for her gracious bounty; but, very little regard was payed to

<P>In March an inquiry into the condition of the navy was begun in the house o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lords. They desired the queen, in an address, to give speedy and effectual orders, that a number of ships sufficient for the home-service should be equipped and manned with all possible expedition. They resolved, That admi∣ral Graydon's not attacking the four French ships in the channel, had been a pre∣judice to the queen's service, and a disgrace to the nation: That his pressing men in Jamaica, and his severity towards masters of merchant vessels and transports, had been a great discouragement to the inhabitants of that island, as well as prejudi∣cial to her majesty's service: and, they presented the address against him, in con∣sequence of which he was dismissed. They examined the accounts of the earl of Orford, against which great clamour had been raised; and, taking cognizance of the remarks made by the commissioners of the public accounts, found them false in fact, ill grounded, or of no importance. The commons besought the queen to order a prosecution on account of ill practices in the earl of Rane∣lagh's office; and, they sent up to the lords a bill for continuing the commission on the public accounts. Some alterations were made in the upper house, espe∣cially, in the nomination of commissioners; but, these were rejected by the commons. The peers adhering to their admendments, the bill dropped and the commission expired. No other bill of any consequence passed in this session, except an act for raising recruits, which impowered justices of the peace to im∣press idle persons for soldiers and marines. On the third day of April the queen went to the house of peers, and having made a short speech on the usual topics of acknowledgment, unity, and moderation, prorogued the parliament to the fourth day of July. The division still continued between the two houses of con∣vocation; so that nothing of moment was transacted in that assembly, except their address to the queen upon her granting the first-fruits and tenths for the augmentation of small benefices. At the same time, the lower house sent their prolocutor with a deputation to wait upon the speaker of the house of commons, to return their thanks to that honourable house for having espoused the interest of the clergy; and, a promise to pursue such methods as might best conduce to the support, honour, interest, and security of the church as now by law esta∣blished. They sent up to the archbishop and prelates divers representations, containing complaints, and proposing canons and articles of reformation; but, very little regard was payed to their r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>monst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>

<P>About this period, the earl of Nottingham, after having ineffectually pressed the queen to d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scard the dukes of Someriet and Devonshire, resigned the seals. The earl of Jersey and Sir Edward Seymour were dismissed: the earl of Kent was appointed chamberlain, Harley secretary of state, and Henry St. John secretary of war. The discovery of the Scottish conspiracy was no sooner known in France, than Lewis ordered Fraser to be imprisoned in the Bastile. In England Lindsay being sentenced to die for having corresponded with France, was given to understand that he had no m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rcy to expect unless he would dis∣cover the conspiracy. He persisted in denying all knowledge of any such conspiracy; and, scorned to save his life by giving false information. In order to intim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>date him into a confession, the ministry ordered him to be conveyed to
<PB N="281" REF="2840"/>
Tyburn, where he still rejected life upon the terms proposed: then he was car∣ried back to Newgate, where he remained some years: at length, he was ba∣nished, and died of hunger in Holland. The ministers had been so lukewarm and languid in the investigation of the Scottish conspiracy, that the Whigs loudly exclaimed against them as disguised Jacobites, and even whispered insinu∣ations, implying, that the queen herself had a secret biass of sisterly affection for the court of St. Germain's. What seemed to confirm this allegation, was the disgrace of the duke of Queensberry, who had exerted himself with remark∣able zeal in the detection; but, the decline of his interest in Scotland was the real cause of his being layed aside at this juncture.</P>

<P>The design of the court was to procure in the Scottish parliament the nomination of a successor to the crown, and a supply for the forces, which could not be obtained in the preceding session. Secretary Johnston, in concert with the marquis of Tweedale, undertook to carry these points, in return for<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Hist. of Q. Anne. Feuquieres. Lockhart. Burchet. Tindal.

The office of lord-register was bestowed upon Johnston; and, the parliament met on the sixth day of July. The queen, in her letter, expressed her concern that these divisions should have risen to such a height, as to encourage the enemies of the nation to employ their emissaries for debauching her good subjects from their allegiance. She declared her resolution to grant whatever could in reason be demanded for quieting the minds of the people. She told them, she had impowered the marquis of Tweedale to give unquestionable proofs of her determination to maintain the government in church and state as by law established in that kingdom; to consent to such laws as should be found wanting for the further security of both, and for preventing all incroachments for the future. She earnestly exhorted them to settle the suc∣cession in the protestant line, as a step absolutely necessary for their own peace<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1704.</NOTE> and happiness, the quiet and security of all her dominions, the reputation of her affairs abroad, and the improvement of the protestant interest through all Europe. She declared, that she had authorized the commissioner to give the royal assent to whatever could be reasonably demanded, and was in her power to grant, for securing the sovereignty and liberties of that her antient kingdom. The remaining part of the letter turned upon the necessity of their granting a supply, the discouragement of vice, the encouragement of commerce, and the usual recommendation of moderation and unanimity.</P>

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Hamilton presented a resolve, That the parliament would not name a successor to the crown, until the Scots should have concluded a pre∣vious treaty with England, in relation to commerce and other concerns. This motion produced a warm debate, in the course of which, Fletcher of Salton expatiated upon the hardships and miseries which the Scots had sustained since the union of the two crowns under one sovereign, and the impossibility of bet∣tering their condition, unless they should take care to anticipate any design that tended to a continuation of the same calamities. Another resolve was produced by the earl of Rothes, importing, That the parliament should proceed to make such limitations and conditions of government as might be judged proper for rectifying the constitu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n; for vindicating and securing the sovereignty and independency of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion; and, then the parliament would take into conside∣ration the other resolve offered by the duke of Hamilton for a treaty previous to the nomination of a successor. This proposal was seconded by the court-party;
<PB N="282" REF="2850"/>
and, violent heats ensued. At length, Sir James Falconer of Phesdo, offered an expedient, which neither party could refuse with any shew of moderation. He suggested a resolve, That the parliament would not proceed to the nomina∣tion of a successor, until the previous treaty with England should be discussed; and, that it would make the necessary limitations and conditions of govern∣ment, before the successor should be nominated. This joint-resolve being put to the vote, was carried by a great majority. The treaty with England was neglected, and the affair of the succession consequently postponed. The duke of Athol moved, That her majesty should be desired to send down the witnesses and all the papers relating to the conspiracy, that after due examination those who were unjustly accused might be vindicated, and the guilty punished accord∣ing to their demerits. The commissioner declared, that he had already written, and would write again to the queen on that subject. The intention of the cava∣lie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s was to convict the duke of Queensberry of malice and calumny in the pro∣secution of that affair, that they might wreak their vengeance upon him for that instance of his animosity, as well as for his having deserted them in the former session But, he found means to persuade the queen, that such an inquiry would not only protract the session, but also divert them from the settlement of the suc∣cession, and raise such a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erment as might be productive of tragical conse∣quences. Alarmed at these suggestions, she resolved to prevent the examina∣tion; and, made no answer to the repeated applications made by her parliament and ministers. Mean while, the duke of Queensberry appeased his enemies in Scotland, by directing all his friends to join in the opposition.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>The duke of Hamilton again moved, That the parliament should proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to the limitations, and name commissioners to treat with England, previous to all other business, except an act for a land-tax of two months, necessary for the immediate subsistence of the forces. The earl of March∣mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t proposed an act to exclude all popish successors; but, this was warmly opposed as unseasonable, by Hamilton and his party. A bill of supply being offered by the lord-justice clerk, the cavaliers tacked to it great part of the act of security, to which the royal assent had been refused in the former session. Violent debates arose; so that the house was filled with rage and tumuit. The national spirit of independence had been wrought up to a dan∣gerous pitch of enthusiasm. The streets were crowded with people of all ranks, excla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng against English influence; and, threatening to sacrifice as traitors to their country, all who should embrace measures that seemed to favour a foreign interest. The commissioner and his friends were confounded and appalled. Finding it impossible to stem the torre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, he, with the concurrence of the other min<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sters, wrote a letter to the queen, representing the uncomfortable situation of affairs, and advising her majesty to pass the bill, incumbered as it was with the act of security. Lord Godolphin, on whose counsel she chiefly relied, found himself involved in great perp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty. The Tories had devoted him to destruction. He forefaw that the queen's conce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion to the Scots in an affair of such consquence, would furnish his enemies with a plausible pretence to arraign the conduct of her minister; but, he chose to run that risque rather than see the army disbanded for want of a supply, and the kingdom left exposed to an invasion. He there∣fore seconded the advice of the Scottish ministers; and, the queen authorised the commissioner to pass the bill that was depending. This act provided, That in case of the queen's dying without i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ue, a parliament should immediately
<PB N="283" REF="2860"/>
meet and declare the successor to the cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, different from the person possessing the throne of England, unless before that period a settlement should be made in parliament, of the rights and liberties of the nation, independent on English councils: by another clause, they were impowered to arm and train the subjects so as to put them in a posture of defence. The Scottish parliament, having by a laudable exertion of spirit obtained this act of security, granted the supply with∣out further hesitation; but, not yet satisfied with this sacrifice, they engaged in debates about the conspiracy, and the proceedings of the house of lords in Eng∣land, which they termed an officious intermeddling in their concerns, and an incroachment upon the sovereignty and independency of the nation. They drew up an address to the queen, desiring, that the evidence and papers relating to the plot, might be subjected to their examination in the next session. Mean while, the commissioner dreading the further progress of such an ungovernable ferocity, prorogued the parliament to the seventh day of October. The act of security being transmitted to England, copies of it were circulated by the ene∣mies of Godolphin, who represented it as a measure of that minister; and, the kingdom was filled with murmurs and discontent. People openly declared, that the two kingdoms were now separated by law, so as never to be rejoined. Re∣ports were spread, that great quantities of arms had been conveyed to Scotland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, that the natives were employed in preparations to invade England. All the blame of these transactions was imputed to lord Godolphin, whom the Tories determined to attack, while the other party resolved to exert their whole influence for his preservation: yet, in all probability, he owed his immediate sup∣port to the success of his friend the duke of Marlborough.</P>

<P>Nothing could be more deplorable than the situation to which the emperor was reduced in the beginning of the season. The malcontents in Hun∣gary had rendered themselves formidable by their success: the elector of Bava∣ria possessed all the places on the Danube as far as Passau, and even threatened the city of Vienna, which must have been infallibly lost had the Hungarians and Bavarians acted in concert. By the advice of prince Eugene, the emperor im∣plored the assistance of her Britannic majesty; and, the duke of Marlborough explained to her the necessity of undertaking his relief. This nobleman in the month of January had crossed the sea to Holland, and concerted a scheme with the deputies of the states-general, for the operations of the ensuing campaign. They agreed, that general Overkirk should lie upon the defensive with a small body of troops in the Netherlands, while the main army of the allies should act upon the Rhine, under the command of the duke of Marlborough. Such was the pretext under which this consummate general concealed another plan, which was communicated to a few only, in whose discretion he could confide. It was approved by the pensionary and some leading men, who secured its fa∣vourable reception with the states-general, when it became necessary to impart the secret to that numerous assembly. In the mean time, the preparations were made, on pretence of carrying the war to the banks of the Moselle.</P>

<P>In the month of April, the duke, accompanied by his brother general Churchill, lieutenant-general Lumley, the earl of Orkney, and other officers of distinction, embarked for Holland, where he had a long conference with a de∣putation of the states, concerning a proposal of sending a large army towards the Moselle. The deputies of Zealand opposed this measure of sending their
<PB N="284" REF="2870"/>
troops to such a distance, so strenuously, that the duke was obliged to tell them in plain terms, he had received orders to march thither with the British forces. He accordingly assembled his army at Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stricht; and, on the eighth day of May began his march into Germany. The French imagined his intention was to begin the campaign with the siege of Traerbach, and penetrate into France along the Moselle. In this persuasion they sent a detachment to that river; and gave out that they intended to invest Huy, a pretence to which the duke payed no regard. He continued his route by Bedburg, Kerpenord, Kalsecken, and visited the fortifications of Bonne, where he received certain advice, that the recruits and reinforcements for the French army in Bavaria had joined the elector at Villingen. He redoubled his diligence, passed the Neckar on the third of June, and halted at Ladenburgh, from whence he wrote a letter to the states-general, giving them to understand, that he had the queen's orders to march to the relief of the empire; and, expressing his hope, that they would approve the design, and allow their troops to share the honour of the expedition. By the return of a courier he received their approbation, and full power to com∣mand their forces. He then proceeded to Mildenheim, where he was visited by pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce Eugene; and, these two great men, whose talents were congenial, im∣mediately contracted an intimacy of friendship. Next day prince Lewis of Baden arrived in the camp at Great Hippach. He told the duke, his grace was come to save the empire, and to give him an opportunity of vindicating his honour, which he knew was at the last stake in the opinion of some people. The duke replied, he was come to learn of him how to serve the empire: that they must be ignorant indeed, who did not know, that the prince of Baden, when his health permitted him, had preserved the empire and extended its conquests.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>Those three celebrated generals agreed, that the two armies should join: that the command should be alternately vested in the duke and prince Lewis, from day to day: and, that prince Eugene should command a separate army on the Rhine. Prince Lewis returned to his army on the Danube: prince Eugene set out for Philipsburg: and, the duke of Marlborough being joined by the Imperial army under prince Lewis of Baden, at Wastertellen, prosecuted his march by Elchingen, Gingen, and Landthaussen. On the first day of July he was in sight of the enemy's intrenchments at Dillingen, and encamped with his right at Amerdighem, and his left at Onderingen. Understanding that the elector of Bavaria had detached the best part of his infantry to reinforce the count D'Arco, who was posted behind strong lines at Schellenberg near Dona∣wert, he resolved to attack their intrenchments without delay. On the second day of July he advanced towards the enemy, passed the river Wermitz; and, about five o'clock in the afternoon the attack was begun by the English and Dutch infantry, supported by the horse and dragoons. They were very severely handled, and even obliged to give way, when prince Lewis of Baden marching up at the head of the Imperialists, to another part of the line, made a diversion in their favour. After an obstinate resistance they forced the intrenchments, and the horse entering with the infantry, fell so furiously upon the enemy al∣ready disordered, that they were routed with great slaughter. They fled with the utmost trepidation to Donawert and the Danube, leaving six thousand men dead on the field of battle. The confederates took sixteen pieces of cannon,
<PB N="285" REF="2880"/>
thirteen pair of colours, with all the tents and baggage. Yet, the victory was dearly purchased: some thousands of the allies were slain in the attack, includ∣ing many gallant officers, among whom were the generals Goor and Beinheim, and count Stirum was mortally wounded. Next day the Bavarian garrison abandoned Donawert, of which the confederates took immediate possession; while the elector passed the Danube in his march to the river Leche, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the victors should cut off his retreat to his own country. The confederates having crossed the Danube on several bridges of pontons, a detachment was sent to pass the Leche, and take post in the country of the elector, who had retired under the cannon of Augsburg. The garrison of Neuburg retiring to Ingolstadt, the place was secured by the confederates; and, the count de Frize was detached with nine battalions and fifteen squadrons to invest the town of Rain. Advice arriving from prince Eugene, that the marechals Villeroy and Tallard had passed the Rhine at Fort Kehl, with an army of five and forty thousand men, to suc∣cour the elector of Bavaria, the generals of the allies immediately detached prince Maximilian of Hanover with thirty squadrons of horse, as a reinforce∣ment to the prince. In a few days Rain surrendered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Aicha was taken by assault. The emperor no sooner received a confirmation of the victory of Schellenbergh, than he wrote a letter of acknowledgment to the duke of Marl∣borough; and, ordered count Wratislau to intimate his intention of investing him with the title of prince of the empire, which the duke declined accepting, until the queen interposed her authority at the desire of Leopold.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>The allies advanced within a league of Augsburg, and tho' they found the elector of Bavaria too securely posted under the cannon of that city, to be dis∣lodged or attacked with any prospect of success, they encamped with Fried∣burg in their centre, so as to cut off all communication between him and his dominions. The duke of Marlborough having reduced him to this situation, proposed very advantageous terms of peace, provided he would abandon the French interest and join the Imperialists in Italy. His subjects seeing them∣selves at the mercy of the allies, pressed him to comply with those offers, rather than expose his country to ruin and desolation. A negotiation was begun, and he seemed ready to sign the articles, when hearing that marechal Tallard had passed the Black-forest to join him with a great body of forces, he declared, that since the king of France had made such powerful efforts to support him, he thought himself obliged in honour to continue firm in his alliance. The generals of the allies were so exasperated at this disappointment, that they sent out detachments to ravage the country of Bavaria as far as Munich; and, up∣wards of three hundred towns, villages, and castles, were inhumanly destroyed, to the indelible disgrace of those who countenanced and conducted such barba∣rous practices. The elector, shocked at these brutal proceedings, desired, in a letter to the duke of Marlborough, that a stop might be put to acts of violence so opposite to true glory. The answer he received, implied, that it was in his own power to put an end to them by a speedy accommodation. Incensed at this reply, he declared, that since they had obliged him to draw the sword, he would throw away the scabbard. The duke and prince Lewis finding it imprac∣ticable to attack the elector in his strong camp, resolved to undertake the siege of Ingolstadt; and, for that purpose passed the Paer near the town of Schrob∣benhausen, where they encamped with their left at Closterberg. On the fifth
<PB N="286" REF="2890"/>
day of August the elector of Bavaria marched to Biberach, where he was joined by Tallard. He resolved to pass the Danube at Lawingen, to attack prince Eugene, who had followed the French army from the lines of Biehl, and lay encamped at Hochstadt. Next day, however, he made a motion that disap∣pointed the enemy. Nevertheless, they persisted in their design of passing the Danube and encamping at Blenheim. The allies resolved, that prince Lewis should undertake the siege of Ingoldstadt, whilst prince Eugene and the duke should observe the elector of Bavaria. Advice being received that he had actu∣ally crossed the Danube at Lawingen, the duke of Marlborough joined the forces of prince Eugene at the camp of Munster on the eleventh day of August, prince Lewis having by this time marched off towards the place he in∣tended to besiege. Next day the duke of Marlborough and prince Eugene ob∣served the posture of the enemy, who were advantageously posted on a hill near Hochstadt, their right being covered by the Danube and the village of Blen∣heim, their left by the village of Lutzengen, and their front by a rivulet, the banks of which were steep and the bottom marshy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding these difficulties, the generals resolved to attack them immediately, rather than he inactive until their forage and provision should be consumed. They were morever stimulated to this hazardous enter∣prize, by an intercepted letter to the elector of Bavaria from marechal Villeroy, giving him to understand, that he had received orders to ravage the country of Wirtemberg, and intercept all communication between the Rhine and the allied army. The dispositions being made for the attack, and the orders communi∣cated to the general officers, the forces advanced into the plain on the thirteenth day of August, and were ranged in order of battle. The cannonading began about nine in the morning, and continued on both sides till one in the after∣noon. The French and Bavarians amounted to about sixty thousand men<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Marechal Tallard commanded on the right, and posted seven and twenty bat∣talions with twelve squadrons in the village of Blenheim, supposing that there the allies would make their chief effort: their left was conducted by the elector of Bavaria, assisted by Marsin, a French general of experience and capacity. The number of the confederates did not exceed five and fifty: their right was under the direction of prince Eugene, and their left commanded by the duke of Marlborough. At noon the action was begun by a body of English and Hessians, under major-general Wilkes, who having passed the rivulet with difficulty, and filed off to the left in the face of the enemy, attacked the village of Blenheim with great vigour; but, were repulsed after three successive attempts. Mean while, the troops in the center and part of the right wing, passed the rivu∣let on planks in different places; and, formed on the other side without any molestation from the enemy. At length, however, they were charged by the French horse with such impetuosity, and so terribly galled in flank by the troops posted at Blenheim, that they fell in disorder, and part of them repassed the rivulet; but, a reinforcement of dragoons coming up, the French cavalry were broke in their turn, and driven to the very hedges of the village of Blenheim. The left wing of the confederates being now completely formed, ascended the hill in a firm compacted body, charging the enemy's horse, which could no longer stand their ground; but, rallied several times as they gave way. Tal∣lard, in order to make a vigorous effort, ordered ten battalions to fill up the in∣tervals
<PB N="287" REF="2900"/>
of his cavalry. The duke perceiving his design, sent three battalions of the troops of Zell to sustain his horse. Nevertheless, the line was a little dis∣ordered by the prodigious fire from the French infantry, and even obliged to re∣coil about sixty paces; but, the confederates advancing to the charge with re∣doubled ardour, routed the French horse; and their battalions being thus aban∣doned, were cut in pieces. Tallard, having rallied his broken cavalry behind some tents that were still standing, resolved to draw off the troops he had posted in the village of Blenheim, and sent an aid-du-camp to Marsin, who was with the elector of Bavaria on the left, to desire he would face the confederates with some troops to the right of the village of Oberklau, so as to keep them in play, and favour the retreat of the forces from Blenheim. That officer assured him, he was so far from being in a condition to spare troops, that he could hardly maintain his ground. The fate of the day was now more than half decided. The French cavalry being vigorously attacked in flank were totally defeated. Part of them endeavoured to gain the bridge which they had thrown over the Danube between Hochstadt and Blenheim; but, they were so closely pursued, that those who escaped the slaughter threw themselves into the river, where they perished. Tallard, being surrounded, was taken near a mill behind the village of Sonderen, together with the marquis de Montperoux general of horse, the major-generals de Seppeville, de Silly, de la Valiere, and many other officers of distinction. Whilst these occurrences passed on the left wing, Marsin's quarters at the village of Oberklau, in the centre, were attacked by ten battalions, under the prince of Holstein-beck, who passed the rivulet with undaunted resolution; but, before he could form his men on the other side, he was overpowered by numbers, mortally wounded and taken prisoner. His battalions being sup∣ported by some Danish and Hanoverian cavalry, renewed the charge, and were again repulsed: at length, the duke of Marlborough in person brought up some fresh squadrons from the body of reserve, and obliged the enemy to retire. By this time, prince Eugene had obliged the left wing of the enemy to give ground, after having surmounted a great number of difficulties, sustained a very obsti∣nate opposition, and seen his cavalry, in which his chief strength seemed to lie, three times repulsed. The duke of Marlborough had no sooner defeated the right wing, than he made a disposition to reinforce the prince, when he un∣derstood from an aid-du-camp, that his highness had no occasion for assistance; and, that the elector with monsieur de Marsin had abandoned Oberklau and Lutzingen. They were pursued as far as the villages of Morselingen and Teis∣senhoven, from whence they retreated to Dillingen and Lawingen. The con∣federates were now masters of the field of battle, and surrounded the village of Blenheim, in which, as we have already observed, seven and twenty battalions and twelve squadrons were posted. Seeing themselves cut off from all com∣munication with the rest of their army, and despairing of being able to force their way through the allies, they capitulated about eight in the evening, layed down their arms, delivered their colours and standards, and surren∣dered themselves prisoners of war, on condition, that the officers should not be rifled. This was one of the most glorious and complete victories that ever was obtained. Ten thousand French and Bavarians were left dead on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ield of battle: the greater part of thirty squadrons of horse and dragoons perished in the river Danube: thirteen thousand were made prisoners: one hundred
<PB N="288" REF="2910"/>
pieces of cannon were taken, with twenty-four mortars, one hundred and twenty-nine colours, one hundred and seventy-one standards, seventeen pair of kettle drums, three thousand six hundred tents, four and thirty coaches, three hundred laden mules, two bridges of boats, fifteen pontoons, fifteen barrels and eight casks filled with silver. Of the allies, about four thousand five hun∣dred men were killed, and about eight thousand wounded or taken. The loss of the battle was imputed to two capital errors committed by marechal Tallard; namely, his weakening the centre, by detaching such a number of troops to the village of Blenheim, and his suffering the confederates to pass the rivulet, and form unmolested. Certain it is, these circumstances contributed to the success of the duke of Marlborough, who rode through the hottest of the fire with the calmest intrepidity, giving his orders with that presence of mind and deliberation which were so peculiar to his character. When he next day visited Tallard, he told that general, he was sorry such a misfortune should happen personally on one for whom he had a profound esteem. The marechal congratulated him on having vanquished the best troops in the world; a com∣pliment to which the duke replied, That he thought his own the best troops in the world, seeing they had conquered those upon whom the marechal had bestowed such an encomium.</P>

<P>The victorious generals having by this decisive stroke saved the house of Austria from ruin, and intirely changed the face of affairs in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mpire, signified their opinion to prince Lewis of Baden, that it would be for the advantage of the common cause to join all their forces and drive the French out of Germany, rather than lose time at the siege of Ingoldstadt, which would surrender of course. This opinion was confirmed by the conduct of the French garrison at Augsburg, who quitted that place on the sixteenth day of August. The magistrates sent a deputation, craving the protection of the duke of Marlborough, who forthwith ordered a detachment to take possession of that important city. The duke having sent marechal de Tallard under a guard of dragoons to Frankfort, and disposed of the other prisoners of dis∣tinction in the adjacent places, encamped at Sefillingen, within half a league of Ulm. Here he held a conference with the princes Eugene and Lewis of Baden, in which they agreed, that, as the enemy retreated towards the Rhine, the confederate army should take the same route, excepting three and twenty battalions and some squadrons, to be left for the siege of Ulm, under general Thungen. They began their march on the twenty sixth day of August, by dif∣ferent routes, to the general rendezvous at Bruschal, near Philipsburg. Then they resolved, that pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce Lewis of Baden should undertake the siege of Lan∣dau, in order to secure the circle of Suabia from the incursions of that garrison. Considering the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rnation that prevailed all over France, nothing could be more impolitic than this measure, which gave the enemy time for recollection, and recruiting their forces. It was a proposal on which the prince of Baden insisted with uncommon obstinacy. He was even suspected of corruption. He was jealous of the glory which the duke of Marlborough had acquired; and such a bigotted paput that he repined at the success of an heretical general. On the twelfth day of September, he marched towards Landau with the troops destined for the siege, and the duke of Marlborough with prince Eugene en∣camped at Croon Weissenburg, to cover the enterprize. By this time Ulm
<PB N="289" REF="2920"/>
had surrendered to Thungen, even before the trenches were opened. Villeroy advanced with his army towards Landau, as if he had intended to attack the confederates; but he retired without having made any attempt for the relief the place, which was defended with the most ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinate valour till the twenty-third day of November, when the besiegers having lodged themselves on the coun∣terscarps, the breaches being practicable, and the dispositions made for a ge∣neral assault, the garrison capitulated upon honourable conditions. The king of the Romans had arrived in the camp, that he might have the credit of taking the place, the command of which he bestowed on the count de Frize, who had before defended it with equal courage and ability.</P>

<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The next enterprize which the confederates undertook, was the siege of Traerbach. The hereditary prince of Hesse-Cassel being intrusted with the direction of the attacks, invested the castle in the beginning of No∣vember; and, though it was strongly fortified and well defended, carried on his operations with such spirit and assiduity, that in about six weeks the garrison surrendered the place on honourable terms. In the mean time, the duke of Marlborough repaired to Berlin, where he negotiated for a rein∣forcement of eight thousand Prussians to serve under prince Eugene in Italy, during the next campaign. Thence he proceeded to the court of Hanover, where, as in all other places, he was received with particular marks of dis∣tinction. When he arrived at the Hague, he was congratulated by the states-general on his victories at Schellenberg and Blenheim, and as much considered in Holland as if he had been actually stadtholder. He had received a second letter from the emperor, couched in the warmest terms of acknowledgment, and was declared prince of the empire. In December he embarked for Eng∣land, where he found the people in a transport of joy, and was welcomed as an hero who had retrieved the glory of the nation.</P>

<P>In Flanders, nothing of moment was executed, except the bombard∣ment of Bruges and Namur by baron Spaar, with nine thousand Dutch troops; and two attempts upon the French lines, which were actually penetrated by Overkirk, though he was not able to maintain the footing he had gained. The elector of Bavaria, who had retired to Brussels after his defeat, formed a scheme for surprising the Dutch general at the end of the campaign, and as∣sembled all his troops at Tirlemont; but the French court, apprehensive of his temerity, sent Villeroy to watch his conduct, and prevent his hazarding an engagement, except with a fair prospect of advantage. The marechal finding him determined to give battle at all events, represented the improbability of succeeding against an enemy so advantageously posted; and the ill consequences of a repulse: but finding the elector deaf to all his remonstrances, he flatly re∣fused to march, and produced the king's order to avoid an engagement. In Italy the French met with no opposition. The duke of Savoy being unable to face the enemy in the field, was obliged to lie inactive, and see the duke of Vendome reduce Vercelli and Ivrea, and undertake the siege of Verac, while he posted his little army on the other side of the Po, at Crescenti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, where he had a bridge of communication, by which he supplied the place occasionally with fresh troops and provision. It held out five months, against all the efforts of the French general: at length the communication being cut off, the duke of Savoy retired to Chivas. He bore his misfortunes with great equanimity;
<PB N="290" REF="2930"/>
and told the English minister, that though he was abandoned by the allies, he would never abandon himself. The emperor had neglected Italy, that he might act with more vigour against Ragotski and the Hungarian malcontents, over whom he obtained several advantages; notwithstanding which they con∣tinued formidable, from their number, bravery, and resolution. The mini∣sters of the allies pressed Leopold to enter into a negotiation for a peace with those rebels, and conferences were opened: but he was not sincerely disposed to an accommodation, and Ragotski aimed at the principality of Transylvania, which the court of Vienna would not easily relinquish. The emperor was not a little alarmed by a revolution at the Ottoman Porte, until the new sultan dispatched a chiaus to Vienna, with an assurance that he would give no assist∣ance to the malcontents of Hungary. In Poland, the diet being assembled by the cardinal-primate, Stanislaus Lezinski, palatine of Posnania, was elected and proclaimed king, and recognized by Charles of Sweden, who still main∣tained his army by contributions in that country, more intent upon the ruin of Augustus than upon the preservation of his own dominions; for he payed no regard to the progress of the Muscovites, who had ravaged Livonia, reduced Narva, and made incursions into Sweden. Augustus retreated into his Saxon dominions, which he impoverished, in order to raise a great army, with which he might return to Poland; and the pope espoused the interest of this new con∣vert, so far as to cite the cardinal-primate to appear at Rome, and give an account of the share he had in the Polish troubles. The protestants of the Cevennois deriving courage from despair, became so troublesome to the go∣vernment of France, that Lewis was obliged to treat them with lenity: he sent marechal Villars against them with a fresh reinforcement; but at the same time furnished him with instructions to treat for an accommodation. This of∣ficer immediately commenced a negotiation with Cavalier, the chief of the re∣volters; and a formal treaty was concluded, by which they were indulged with liberty of conscience. But these articles were v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry ill observed by the French ministry.</P>

<P>In Portugal the interest of king Charles wore a very melancholy aspect. When he arrived at Lisbon, he found no preparations made for open∣ing the campaign. The Portuguese ministry favoured the French in secret: the people were averse to heretics: the duke of Schomberg was on ill terms with Fagel the Dutch general: the Portuguese forces consisted of raw un∣disciplined peasants: and the French ambassador had bought up the best horses in the kingdom; so that the troopers could not be properly mounted. The king of Portugal had promised to enter Spain with Charles by the middle of May: but he was not ready till the beginning of June, when they reached Santaren. By this time they had published their respective manifestoes; Charles displaying his title to the crown of Spain, and promising pardon to all his sub∣jects who should in three months join his army; and the king of Portugal de∣claring that his sole aim in taking up arms, was to restore the liberty of the Spanish nation, oppressed by the power of France, as well as to assert the right of Charles to that monarchy. The present possessor, whom they mentioned by the name of the duke of Anjou, had already anticipated their invas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n. His general the duke of Berwick entering Portugal, took the town of Segura by stra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agem. The governor of Salva-terra surrendered at discretion: Cebre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>os
<PB N="291" REF="2940"/>
was reduced without much opposition: Zebredo was abandoned by the in∣habitants; and the town of Ihana la Viella was taken by affault. Porrugal was at the same invaded in different parts by the marquis de Jeoffreville, prince Tserclaes de Tilly, and the marquis de Villadarias. Two Dutch battalions were attacked and taken by the duke of Berwick at Sodreira Formosa. Then he passed the Tagus and joined prince Tserclaes. King Philip arriving in the army, invested Portalegre; and the garrison, including an English regiment of foot commanded by colonel Stanhope, were made prisoners of war. The next place he besieged was Castel Davide, which met with the same fate, although the marquis Das Minas, in order to make a diversion, entered Spain with fifteen thousand men, took Fuente Grimaldo, in Castile, by assault, defeated a body of French and Spaniards commanded by Don Ronquillo, and made himself master of Manseinto. The weather growing excessively hot, Philip sent his troops into quarters of refreshment; and the allies followed his example. Duke Schomberg finding his advice very little regarded by the Portuguese ministry, and seeing very little prospect of success, desired leave to resign his command, which the queen bestowed upon the earl of Galway, who, with a reinforcement of English and Dutch troops, arrived at Lisbon on the thirtieth day of July. About the latter end of September, the two kings repaired to the camp near Almeda, resolving to invade Castile; but they found the river Agueda so well guarded by the duke of Berwick, that they would not attempt a passage. They therefore retired into the territories of Portugal, and the army was put into winter-quarters. The Spaniards were now so weakened, by detachments sent with the marquis de Villadarias towards Gibraltar, that the duke of Berwick could not execute any scheme of importance during the remaining part of the campaign.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>The arms of England were not less fortunate by sea than they had been upon the Danube. Sir George Rooke having landed king Charles at Lisbon, sent a squadron to cruise off cape Spartell, under the command of rear-admiral Dilkes, who, on the twelfth of March, engaged and took three Spanish ships of war, bound from St. Sebastian's to Cadiz. Rooke received orders from the queen to sail to the relief of Nice and Villa Franca, which were threatened with a siege by the duke of Vendome; and at the same time he was pressed by king Charles to execute a scheme upon Barcelona, projected by the prince of Hesse-D'Armstadt, who declared his opinion, that the Catalonians would declare for the house of Austria, as soon as they should be assured of proper support and protection. The ministry of England understanding that the French were employed in equipping a strong squadron in Brest, and judging it was destined to act in the Mediterranean, sent out Sir Cloudesley Shovel with a considerable fleet, to watch the motions of the Brest squadron; and he was provided with instructions how to act in case it should be sailed to the Mediter∣ranean. Mean while, Sir George Rooke, in compliance with the intreaties of king Charles, sailed with the transports under his convoy to Barcelona, and on the eighteenth of May appeared before the city. Next day, the troops were landed by the prince of Hesse, to the number of two thousand, and the Dutch ketches bombarded the place: but by this time the governor had secured the chiefs of the Austrian party; and the people exhibiting no marks of attach∣ment to king Charles, the prince reimbarked his soldiers, from an apprehension of
<PB N="292" REF="2950"/>
their being attacked and overpowered by number. On the sixteenth day of June, Sir George Rooke being joined by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, resolved to proceed up the Mediterranean in quest of the French fle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, which had sailed thither from Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and which Rooke had actually d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>covered, in the preceding month, on their voyage to Toulon. On the seventeenth day of July, the admiral called a council of war in the road of Tetuan, when they re∣solved to make an attempt upon Gibraltar, whi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h was but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lenderly provided with a garrison. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther they sailed, and on the twenty-first day of the month the prince of Hesse landed on the isthmus with eighteen hundred marines: then he summoned the governor to surrender, and was answered, that the place would be defended to the last extremity. Next day the admiral gave orders for cannonading the town; and perceiving that the enemy were driven from their fortifications at the south mole-head, commanded captain Whitaker to arm all the boats, and assault that quarter. The captains Hick and Jumper, who hap∣pened to be nearest the mole, immediately manned their pinaces, and entered the forti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cations sword in hand. The Spaniards sprung a mine, by which two lieutenants and about a hundred men were killed or wounded. Neverthe∣less, the two captains took possession of a platform, and kept their ground un∣til they were sustained by captain Whitaker and the rest of the seamen, who took by storm a redoubt between the mole and the town. Then the governor capitulated; and the prince of Hesse entered the place, amazed at the success of this attempt, considering the strength of the fortifications, which might have been defended by fifty men against a numerous army.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="23" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A sufficient garrison being left with his highness, the admiral re∣turned to Tetuan to take in wood and water; and when he sailed, on the ninth day of August, he descried the French fleet, to which he gave chace with all the sail he could spread. On the thirteenth he came up with it, as it lay in a line off Malaga ready to receive him, to the number of two and fifty great ships, and four and twenty galleys, under the command of the count de Tholouse, high∣admiral of France, with the inferior flags of the white and blue divisions. The English fleet consisted of three and fifty ships of the line, exclusive of frigates; but they were inferior to the French in number of guns and men, as well as in weight of metal, and altogether unprovided of gallies, from which the enemy reaped great adv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tage during the engagement. A little after ten in the morning, the battle began with equal fury on both sides, and continued to rage with doubtful success till two in the afternoon, when the van of the French gave way: nevertheless, the fight was maintained till night, when the enemy bore away to leeward. The wind shifting before morning, the French gained the weather-gage; but they made no use of this advantage: for two successive days the English admiral endeavoured to renew the engagement, which the count de Tholouse declined, and at last he disappeared. The loss was pretty equal on both sides, though not a single ship was taken or destroyed by either: but the honour of the day certainly remained with the English. Over and above the dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antages we have enumerated, their bottoms were foul, and several large ships had expended all their shot long before the battle ceased: yet the enemy were so roughly handled, that they did not venture an∣other engagement during the whole war. The French king, in order to raise the drooping spirits of his people, claimed the victory, and published an ac∣count
<PB N="293" REF="2960"/>
of the action, which, at this distance of time, plainly proves that he was reduced to the mean shift of imposing upon his subjects, by false and partial representations. Among other exaggerations in this detail, we find mention made of mischief done to French ships by English bombs; though nothing is more certain, than that there was not one bomb-vessel in the combined fleet. The French academy, actuated by a servile spirit of adulation, caused a medal to be struck on the occasion, which, instead of perpetuating the glory of their prince, serves only to transmit their own shame to posterity. After the battle, Sir George Rooke sailed to Gibraltar to refit, and leaving a squadron with Sir John Leake, set sail for England on the twenty-fourth day of August. He arrived in September, and was received by the ministry, and the people in general, with those marks of esteem and veneration which were due to his long services and signal success: but he was still persecuted with a spirit of envy and de∣traction. Philip king of Spain, alarmed at the reduction of Gibraltar, sent the marquis de Villadarias with an army to retake it. The siege lasted four months, during which the prince of Hesse exhibited many shining proofs of courage and ability. The place was supplied with men and provisions by convoys from Lisbon, until monsieur de Pointis put a stop to that communi∣cation, by entering the bay with a strong squadron: but he was obliged to retire at the approach of Sir John Leake and admiral Vanderdussen; and the marquis de Villadarias having made little or no progress at land, thought pro∣per to abandon the enterprise.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament of England meeting on the twenty-ninth day of October, the queen in her speech observed, that the great and remarkable suc∣cess with which God had blessed her arms, produced unanimous joy and satis∣faction through all parts of the kingdom; and that a timely improvement of the present advantages would enable her to procure a lasting foundation of se∣curity for England, as well as a firm support for the liberty of Europe. She declared her intention was to be kind and indulgent to all her subjects. She expressed her hope that they would do nothing to endanger the loss of this opportunity; and that there would be no contention among them, but an emu∣lation to promote the public welfare. Contratulatory addresses were voted and presented by both houses. They were equal in their professions of duty and affection to the queen; but the addresses imbibed a very different colour from the different factions by which the two houses were influenced. The lords congratulated her on the great and glorious success of her arms under the com∣mand of the duke of Marlborough, without deigning to mention Sir George Rooke, who had defeated the French navy at sea, and added the important fortress of Gibraltar to the British conquests. On the other hand, the com∣mons affected to mention the battle of Blenheim, and Rooke's naval victory, as events of equal glory and importance. However, they might be warped by prejudice against individuals, they did not suffer the war to languish for want of supplies. Having taken into consideration the services of the army and navy, they voted that the queen should be desired to bestow her bounty on the seamen and land-forces who had behaved themselves so gallantly. Then they deliberated upon the different articles of national expence, and granted four millions six hundred and seventy thousand nine hundred and thirty-one pounds, for the occasions of the ensuing year, to be raised by a land tax,
<PB N="294" REF="2970"/>
by the sal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ities, and other expedients. These measures were taken with such expedition, that the land-tax received the royal assent on the ninth day of D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cember<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when the queen, in a short speech, thanked the commons for their dispatch, which she considered as a sure pledge of their affection.</P>

<P>The high-church party took this occasion to promote the bill against occasional conformity, which was revived and brought into the house on a new model, by Mr. William Bromley, who moved that it might be tacked to the land-tax bill, and sent up to the lords for their concurrence. The court no longer espoused this measure; and the violent party was weakened by de∣fection. After a warm and tedious debate, the tack was rejected by a great majority. The bill, however, passed the house of commons, and was sent up to the lords on the fourteenth day of December, when it would hardly have excited a debate, had not the queen been present, and desirous of hearing what could be said on both sides of the question. For the information and satis∣faction of her majesty, the subject was again discussed, and all the arguments being repeated, the bill was rejected by a majority of one and twenty voices. The next subject on which the house of lords employed their attention, was the late conduct of the Scottish parliament. The lord Haversham, in a set speech, observed, that the settlement of the succession in Scotland had been postponed, partly because the ministry for that kingdom were weak and di∣vided; partly from a received opinion that the succession was never sincerely and cordially intended by those who managed the affairs of Scotland in the cabinet-council. He expatiated on the bad consequences that might attend the act of security, which he stiled a bill of exclusion; and particularly men∣tioned that clause by which the heritors and boroughs were ordained to exercise their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensible men every month. He said the nobility and gentry of Scotland were as learned and brave as any nation in Europe, and generally discontented: that the common people were very numerous, very stout, and very poor; and he asked who was the man that could tell what such a multitude, so armed, and so disciplined, might do under such leaders, could opportunities suit their inten∣tion? He recommended these circumstances to the consideration of the house, and concluded with these words of lord Bacon, <Q>“Let men beware how they neglect or suffer matter of troubles to be prepared; for no man can forbid the sparks that may set all on fire.”</Q> They resolved to consider these sub∣jects on the twenty-ninth day of November, when the queen repaired to the house of peers to hear the debates, and by her presence moderate the heat of both p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rties<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The earl of Nottingham reflected so severely on the memory of king William, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e would have been sent to the Tower, had not the lords declined any such motion, out of respect to her majesty. After much declama∣tion on the Scottish act of security, the grand committee of the peers, by the advice of lord Wharton, resolved, That the queen should be enabled by act of parliament on the part of England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to name commissioners to treat about an union with Scotland, provided that the parliament of Scotland should first ap∣point commissioners on their part for the same purpose. That no Scotsmen should enjoy the privileges of Englishmen, except such as were settled in Eng∣land, Ireland, and the plantations, and such as were or might be in the sea or land∣service, until an union could be effected, or the succession settled as in England: That the traffic by cattle from Scotland to England should be prevented:
<PB N="295" REF="2980"/>
That the lord admiral should issue orders for taking such v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssels as should be found trading from Scotland to France, or to the ports of any of her majesties enemies; and that care should be taken to prevent the exportation of English wool into Scotland. On these resolutions a bill was formed for an inti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e union, and passed the house on the twentieth day of December. The lords presented an address to the queen, representing that they had duly weighed the dangerous andipernicious effects that were likely to be produced by divers acts of parlia∣ment lately passed in Scotland: That they were of opinion, the safety of the kingdom required that speedy and effectual orders should be given to put Newcastle in a posture of defence, secure the port of Tinmouth, and repair the fortifications of Hull and Carlile. They likewise advised her majesty to give directions for disciplining the militia of the four northern counties; for pro∣viding them with arms and ammunition; for maintaining a competent num∣ber of regular troops on the northern borders of England, as well as in the north of Ireland; and for putting the laws in execution against papists. The queen promised that a survey should be made of the places they had mentioned, and laid before the parliament; and that she would give the necessary directions upon the other articles of the address. The commons seemed to concur with the lords in their sentiments of the Scottish act of security. They resolved, That a bill should be brought in for the effectual securing the kingdom of England from the apparent dangers that might arise from several acts lately passed in the parliament of Scotland; and this was formed on nearly the same resolutions which had been taken in the upper-house. The bill sent down by the lords was thrice read, and ordered to lie upon the table; while they passed their own, to take effect at Christmas, provided before that time the Scots should not settle the succession. When it was offered to the lords, they passed it without any amendment, contrary to the expectation, and even to the hope, of some members who were no friends to the house of Hanover, and firmly believed the lords would have treated this bill with the same contempt which had been manifested for that which they had sent down to the commons.</P>

<P>The duke of Marlborough, at his first appearance in the house after his return to England, was honoured with a very extraordinary eulogium, pronounced by the lord-keeper, in the name of the peers of England; and a compliment of the same nature was presented to him by a committee of the house of commons. Doctor Delaune, vice-chancellor of Oxford, accompanied by the principal members of the university, attended the queen with an address of congratulation upon the success of her arms in Germany, under the ad∣mirable conduct and invincible courage of the duke of Marlborough; and at sea, under the most brave and faithful admiral Sir George Rooke. He re∣ceived a civil answer from her majesty, though now she took umbrage at Rooke's being raised upon a level with the duke of Marlborough, whose great victories had captivated her admiration, and whose wife had al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enated her affection from the Tories. The commons perceiving how high he stood in her majesty's esteem, and having been properly tutored for the purpose, took into consideration the great services of the duke; and, in an address, besought her majesty to consider some proper means to perpetuate the memory of such noble actions. In a few days she gave them to understand by a message, that she was inclined to grant the interest of the crown in the honour and manour of
<PB N="296" REF="2990"/>
Woodstock and hundred of Wooton, to the duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and that, as the lieutenancy and rangership of the parks, with the rents and profits of the manours and hundreds were granted for two lives, she wished that incumbrance could be removed. A bill was immediately brought in, enabling the queen to bestow these honours and manours on the duke of Marlborough and his heirs; and the queen was desired to advance the money for clearing the incumbrances. She not only complied with this address, but likewise ordered the comptroller of her works to build, in Woodstock-park, a magnificent palace for the duke, upon a plan much more solid than beautiful. By this time, Sir George Rooke was layed aside, and the command of the fleet bestowed upon Sir Cloudesley Shovel, now declared rear admiral of England. Marechal de Tallard, with the other French generals taken at Hockstadt, arrived on the sixteenth of December in the river Thames, and were immediately con∣veyed to Nottingham and Litchfield, where they were attended by a detach∣ment of the royal regiment of horse-guards. They were treated with great respect, and allowed the privilege of riding ten miles around the places of their confinement.</P>

<P>While the house of commons, in two successive addresses, thanked the queen for the treaty which the duke of Marlborough had concluded with Prussia, concerning the troops to be sent to the duke of Savoy; and desired she would use her interest with the allies, that they might next year furnish their complete proportions of men by sea and land; the lords examined into all the proceedings at sea, and all the instructions of the admiralty; and presented an address to the queen, explaining all the different articles of mismanage∣ment. She promised to consider them particularly, and give such directions upon them as might be most for the advantage of the public service. The re∣maining part of the session was consumed in disputes and altercations between the two houses, on the subject of the Aylesbury constables, who were sued by five other inhabitants, for having denied them the right of voting at the election. These five persons were committed to Newgate by order of the house of com∣mons. They moved for a habeas corpus in the king's-bench; but the court would take no cognizance of the affair. Two of the prisoners petitioned the queen that their case might be brought before her majesty in parliament. The commons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in an address, besought the queen to refuse granting a writ of error in this case, which would tend to the overthrowing the undoubted rights and privileges of the commons of England. She assured them she would not do any thing to give them just cause of complaint; but this matter relating to the course of judicial proceedings, being of the highest importance, she thought it necessary to weigh and consider very carefully what might be proper for her to do in a thing of so great concern. They voted all the lawyers who had pleaded on the return of the habeas corpus in behalf of the prisoners, guilty of a breach of privilege; and ordered them to be taken into custody. They like∣wise ordered the prisoners to be removed from Newgate into the custody of their serjeant at arms, lest they should have been discharged by the queen's granting writs of error. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prisoners finding themselves at the mercy of the exaspe∣rated commons, petitioned the lords for relief. The upper-house passed six dif∣ferent resolutions against the conduct of the commons, as being an obstruction to justice, and contrary to magna charta. The lower-house demanded a con∣ference,
<PB N="297" REF="3000"/>
in which they insisted upon the sole right of determining elections; they affirmed, that they only could judge who had a right of voting; and, that they were judges of their own privileges, in which the lords could not intermeddle.</P>

<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The upper house demanded a free conference, which proved in∣effectual. New resolutions were taken by the commons, diametrically opposite to those of the peers, who, on the other hand, attended the queen with a long representation of all the particulars relating to this affair. They affirmed, that the proceedings of the house of commons against the Aylesbury men were wholly new and unprecedented: that it was the birthright of every English∣man who apprehended himself injured, to seek for redress in her majesty's courts of justice: that if any power could controul this right, and prescribe when he should, and when he should not, be allowed the benefit of the laws, he ceased to be a freeman, and his liberty and property were precarious. They requested, therefore, that no consideration whatever should prevail with her ma∣jesty to suffer an obstruction to the known course of justice; but, that she would be pleased to give effectual orders for the immediate issuing of the writs of error. The queen assured them, that she should have complied with their request; but, finding an absolute necessity for putting an immediate end to this session, she knew there could be no further proceedings on that matter. On that very day, which was the fourteenth of March, she went to the house of lords, and passed the bills that were ready for the royal assent. Then she thanked the parliament for having dispatched the public business, warned them to avoid the fatal effects of animosity and dissension; and, ordered the lord-keeper to<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

The queen, accompanied by the prince of Denmark, made an excursion to New-market, and afterwards dined by invitation with the univer∣sity of Cambridge, where she conferred the honour of knighthood upon Dr. Ellis the vice-chancellor, James Montague counsel for the university, and the celebrated Isaac Newton mathematical professor. The two houses of convoca∣tion still continued at variance. The lower house penned petulant representa∣tions; and, the ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hbishop answered them by verbal reprehension and admoni∣tion. The Tory <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nterest was now in the wane. The duke of Buckingham∣shire was deprived of the privy-seal, and that office conferred upon the d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of Newcastle, a nobleman of powerful influence with the Whig party. The earl of Montague was created marquis of Mounthermer and duke of Monta∣gue; the earl of Peterborough and lord Cholmondley were chosen of the privy∣council; and the lord Cutts was sent to command the troops in Ireland, under the duke of Ormond.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1705.</NOTE> The ministry of Scotland was now intirely changed. The marquis of Tweedale and Johnston having been found unequal to the un∣dertaking, were dismissed. The duke of Queensberry resumed the manage∣ment of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fairs in that kingdom, under the title of lord privy-seal; and the office of commissioner was conferred upon the young duke of Argyle, who suc∣ceeded to his father's influence among the presbyterians. He was a nobleman possess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of good natural talents, which had not been neglected; candid, open and sincere, brave, passionate, and aspiring: had he been endued with a greater
<PB N="298" REF="3010"/>
share of liberality, his character would have been truly heroic. At this junc∣ture, he was instructed to procure an act of the Scottish parliament settling the protestant succession; or, to set on foot a treaty for the union of the two king∣doms. At the opening of the session in June, the members were divided into three parties, namely, the Cavaliers or Jacobites, the revolutioners, the squa∣drone volante, or flying squadron, headed by the marquis of Tweedale, who dis∣claimed the other two factions, and pretended to act from the dictates of con∣science alone. The parliament was adjourned to the third day of July, when her majesty's letter was read, earnestly recommending the settlement of the suc∣cession in the protestant line; and, an act for a commission to treat of an union between the two kingdoms. The marquis of Annandale proposed, that the parliament should proceed on the limitations and conditions of government: and, that a committee should be appointed to consider the condition of the coin and the commerce of the nation. The earl of Mar moved, that the house would<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> preferably to all other business, consider the means for engaging in a treaty with England. After a long debate, they resolved to proceed on the coin and the commerce. Schemes for supplying the nation with money by a paper-credit were presented by Dr. Hugh Chamberlayne and John Law; but rejected. The house resolved, That any kind of paper-credit, by the circula∣tion of bills, was an improper expedient; and appointed a council to put the laws relating to trade in execution. The duke of Hamilton proposed, that the parliament should not proceed to the nomination of a successor, until the treaty with England should be discussed, and the limitations be settled. This proposal being approved, a draught of an answer to her majesty's letter was presented by the marquis of Tweedale. Two different forms of an act for a treaty with England were offered by the earl of Mar and the marquis of Lo∣thian; and, others were produced concerning the election of officers of state, and the regulation of commerce.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The chief aim of the cavaliers was, to obstruct the settlement of the succession; and, with that view they pressed the project of limitations, to which they knew the court would never assent. A motion being made, to grant the first reading to an act of commission for a treaty with England, the duke of Hamilton insisted on the limitations, and a vote being stated in these terms, "Proceed to consider the act for a treaty, or limitation:" the latter was carried in favour of the cavaliers. On the twenty-second day of August an act for this purpose was approved; and next day an act for a triennial parlia∣ment, which the courtiers were enabled to defeat. They likewise passed an act, ordaining, That the Scottish ambassadors representing Scotland should be pre∣sent when the sovereign might have occasion to treat with foreign princes and states; and accountable to the parliament of Scotland. Fletcher of Saltoun presented a scheme of limitations that favoured strong of republican princi∣ples. He afterwards enlarged upon every article, endeavouring to prove, that they were absolutely necessary to prevent the consequences of English influence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nable the nation to defend its rights and liberties; to deter ministers of state from giving bad advice to their sovereign; to preserve the courts of judicature from corruption, and screen the people from tyranny and oppression. The earl of Stair having argued against these limitations, Fletcher replied, <Q>“It was no won∣der he opposed the scheme; for, had such an act subsisted, his lordship would
<PB N="299" REF="3020"/>
have been hanged for the bad counsel he had given to king James; for the concern he had in the massacre of Glencoe; and, for his conduct since the revo∣lution.”</Q> The next subject on which the parliament deliberated, was the con∣spiracy. A motion being made, that the house might know what answer the queen had returned to their address in the last session, the chancellor delivered to the clerk-register the papers relating to the plot, that they might be perused by the members. But, these being copies, and the evidences remaining at Lon∣don, no farther progress was made in the affair. Yet, the duke of Athol, in a distinct narrative of the pretended conspiracy, boldly accused the duke of Queensberry, of having endeavoured to mislead the queen by false insinuations against her good subjects. When the act for a treaty of union fell under consi∣deration, a draught for that purpose, presented by the earl of Mar, was com∣pared with the English act, impo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting, That the queen should name and appoint not only the commissioners for England, but likewise those for Scotland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fletcher did not fail to inveigh against the imperious conduct of the English parliament in this affair. He exhorted the house to resent such treatment<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and offered the draught of an address to her majesty on the subject; but, this the house rejected. Duke Hamilton proposed, that a clause might be added to the act, importing, That the union should no ways derogate from any funda∣mental laws, antient privileges, offices, rights, liberties, and dignities of the Scottish nation. This occasioned a long debate; and, the question being put, was carried in the negative. Another clause was proposed, that the Scottish commissioners should not begin to treat until the English parliament should have rescinded their clause, enacting, That the subjects of Scotland should be adjudged and taken as aliens after the twenty-fifth day of December. The courtiers considering the temper of the house, would not venture to oppose this motion di∣rectly, but proposed, that the clause should be formed into a separate act; and the expedient was approved. Though the duke of Athol entered a vigorous protest, to which the greater part of the cavaliers, and all the squadrone ad∣hered, comprehending four and twenty peers, seven and thirty barons, and eighteen buroughs, the act for the treaty of union was, after much alterca∣tion finished, impowering commissioners to meet and treat of an union; but restraining them from treating of any alterations of the church-government a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by law established. While this important subject was under consideration, the duke of Hamilton, to the amazement of his whole party, moved, that the no∣mination of the commissioners should be left to the queen. Fourteen or fifteen of the cavaliers ran out of the house in a transport of indignation, exclaiming, that they were deserted and basely betrayed by the duke of Hamilton. A very hot debate ensued, in the course of which the duke was severely handled by those whom he had hitherto conducted; but, at length, the question being put, Whe∣ther the nomination should be left to the queen or to the parliament? the duke's motion was approved by a very small majority. He afterwards excused him∣self for his defection, by saying, he saw it was in vain to contend; and that, since the court had acquired a great majority, he thought he might be allowed to pay that compliment to his sovereign. He was desirous of being in the commission, and the duke of Argyle promised he should be nominated. The queen refusing to honour him with that mark of distinction, Argyle would not suffer himself to be named, and threatened to oppose the union;
<PB N="300" REF="3030"/>
but, means were found to appease his resentment. Two draughts of an address being presented by the earl of Sutherland and Fletcher of Saltoun, beseeching her majesty to use her endeavours with the parliament of England, to rescind that part of their act which declared the subjects of Scotland aliens; and, an over∣ture of a bill being offered<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ordaining, that the Scottish commissioners should not enter upon the treaty of union until that clause should be repealed; the courtiers moved, that the parliament should proceed by way of order to their commissioners, and by address to her majesty. After some debate, the house affenting to this proposal, the order and address were drawn up and approved. The great and weighty affair of the treaty being at length happily transacted, though not without a protest by Athol and his adherents, the parliament granted a supply of fifty thousand pounds; and the house was adjourned to the twentieth day of December<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then the queen declared the earl of Mar secre∣tary of state, in the room of the marquis of Annandale, who was appointed lord-president of the council.</P>

<P>In Ireland the parliament met at Dublin on the fifth day of March, and voted one hundred and fifty thousand pounds for the support of the neces∣sary branches of the establishment. A dispute arose between the commons and the lower house of convocation, relating to the tythes of hemp and flax, ascer∣tained in a clause of a bill for the better improvement of the hempen and flaxen manufactures of the kingdom. The lower house of convocation presented a memorial against this clause, as prejudicial to the rights and properties of the clergy. The commons voted the person who brought it guilty of a breach of privilege; and ordered him to be taken into custody. Then they resolved, That the convocation were guilty of a contempt, and breach of the privilege of that house. The convocation presuming to justify their memorial, the com∣mons voted, That all matters relating to it should be razed out of the journals and books of convocation. The duke of Ormond, dreading the consequence of such heats, adjourned the parliament to the first day of May, when the houses meeting again, came to some resolutions that reflected obliquely on the convo∣cation, as enemies to her majesty's government and the protestant succession. The clergy, in order to acquit themselves of all suspicion, resolved in their turn, That the church and nation had been happily delivered from popery and tyran∣ny by king William at the revolution: That the continuance of these blessings were due (under God) to the auspicious reign and happy government of her ma∣jesty queen Anne: That the future security and preservation of the church and nation depended wholly (under God<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the succession of the crown as settled by law in the protestant line: That if any clergyman should by word or writing declare any thing in opposition to these resolutions, they should look upon him as a sower of divisions among the protestants, and an enemy to the constitution. They levelled another resolution against the presbyterians, importing, That to teach or preach against the doctrine, government, rites, or ceremonies of the church, or to maintain schools or seminaries for the education of youth, in principles contrary to those of the established church, was a contempt of the ecclesiastical laws of the kingdom; of pernicious consequence; and served only to continue and widen the unhappy schisms and divisions in the nation. In June the parliament was prorogued to the same month of the following year; then the duke of Ormond embarked for England, leaving the administration in the
<PB N="301" REF="3040"/>
hands of Sir Richard Cox lord-chancellor, and the lord Cutts commander in chief of the queen's forces, who were appointed lords-justices during the duke's absence.</P>

<P>During these transactions in Great-Britain and Ireland, the allies had not been remiss in their preparations for the ensuing campaign. The duke of Marlborough had fixed upon the Moselle for the scene of action; and, ma∣gazines of all sorts were formed at Triers. On the thirteenth day of March the duke embarked for Holland, where he prevailed upon the states-general to contribute their troops for the execution of his project. Having concerted with the deputies of the states and the Dutch generals, the necessary measures for opening the campaign, he set out for Maestricht, in order to assemble his army. On the fifth day of May the emperor Leopold died at Vienna, and was suc∣ceeded on the Imperial throne by his eldest son Joseph king of the Romans, a prince who resembled his father in meekness of disposition, narrowness of in∣tellect, and bigotry to the romish religion. On the fifteenth of June the Eng∣lish troops passed the Maese, and continued their march towards the Moselle, under the command of general Churchill; and, the duke set out for Creutznach, to confer with prince Lewis of Baden, who excused himself on pretence of being much indisposed. Marlborough visited him at Rastadt, where<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in a conference they resolved, that a sufficient number of German troops should be left for the security of the lines of Lauterburg and Stolhoffen, under the command of ge∣neral Thungen; and, that prince Lewis of Baden should march with a large detachment towards the Saar, to act in concert with the duke of Marlborough. The confederate army passed the Moselle and the Saar in the beginning of June, and encamped at Elft in sight of the enemy, who retired with great precipitation, and intrenched themselves in the neighbourhood of Conings∣macheren. The duke's design was to besiege Saar-Louis; but, prince Lewis failed in the performance of his engagement: he feigned himself sick, and repaired to the bath at Schlangenbade, leaving the small number of Imperial troops he had conducted as far as Creutznach, under the command of the count de Frize. He was suspected of treachery; but probably acted from envy of the duke's military reputation.</P>

<P>While this nobleman sustained such a mortifying disappoint∣ment on the Moselle, the French did not fail to make advantage of their supe∣riority in the Netherlands, where general Overkirk was obliged to stand on the defensive. They invested Huy, and carried on their operations so vigorously, that in a few days the garrison were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war: then Villeroy undertook the reduction of Liege, and actually began his works before the citadel. Marlborough was no sooner informed of the enemy's progress than he marched to Triers, where, in a council it was resolved, that the army should return to the Netherlands. The troops were in motion on the nineteenth of June, and marched with such expedition, that they passed the Maese on the first day of July. Villeroy having received advice of the duke's approach, abandoned his enterprize, and retired to Tongeren, from whence he retreated within his lines. Marlborough having joined Overkirk, sent general Scholten with a detachment to invest Huy; and, in a few days the garrison surrendered at discretion. The English general resolving to strike some stroke of importance, that should attone for his disappointment on the Moselle, sent general Hompesch to the states, with a proposal for attacking the French lines;
<PB N="302" REF="3050"/>
and obtained their permiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on to do whatever he should think proper for the good of the common cause. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en he explained the scheme in two successive counc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ls of war, by which, at length, it was approved and resolved upon, tho' some Dutch gener<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lared against the undertaking. The enemy were posted along the lines, amounting to one hundred battalions and one hundred and forty-six squ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rons. The al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed army did not much exceed that number. In order to divide them, Overkirk made a false motion and pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed the Mehaigne, as if he had intended to attack the lines about Meffelin; and, the stratagem succeeded The French weakened the other parts by strengthening that which was on the side of the Gerbise towards Namur. The duke of Marlborough having made the disposition, the army began to march in the night between the seven∣teenth and eighteenth of July, in order to force a passage of the French lines at Elixheim, the castle of Waugh, and the villages of Waugh, Neerhespen, and Oostmalen. These posts were taken with very little difficulty; but, before the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfantry could come up, the enemy advanced with fifty squadrons and twe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y battalions, and began to fire from eight pieces of cannon with triple barrels, which did considerable execution. The duke perceiving that they were con∣tinually reinforced from the other parts of the lines, ordered the horse to charge their cavalry, which were soon broken and routed; but rallying behind their infantry, interlined with foot, and joined by fresh squadrons, they advanced again towards the allies, who were now sustained by their infantry, and moved forwards to renew the charge. After a warm, though short engagement, the enemy's horse were defeated with great slaughter. The infantry, seeing themselves abandoned in the plain, retreated in great disorder, between the villages of Heilisheim and Golsteven, where they were joined by the rest of their army, and formed again in order of battle. Mean while, the duke of Marlborough or∣dered all his troops to enter the lines; and extended his right towards the Great Geete before Tirlemont, where the enemy had left the battalion of Montluc, which surrendered at discretion. In this action the confederates took the marquis D'Alegre and the count de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>orne, lieutenant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>generals, one major-general, two brigadier-generals, with many other officers, and a great number of common soldiers, a large heap of standards, four colours, one pair of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ettle-drums, and ten pieces of cannon. In the action, as the duke of Marlborough advanced to the charge at the head of several squadrons, a Bavarian officer rode up to attack him sword in hand; but<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in raising himself on his stirrups to strike with the greater advantage, he fell from his horse, and was immediately slain.</P>

<P>The body of troops commanded by monsieur D'Alegre being thus defeated with little or no loss to the confederates, the elector of Bavaria and the marechal de V<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eroy pasied the Great Geete and the Deule, with great expe∣dition, and took possess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on of the strong camp at Parck, their left extending to Roo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elaer, and their right to Wineselen against the height of Louvain. Next day the duke of Marlborough marching through the plain of Parck, took twelve hundred prisoners, who could not keep pace with the rest of the enemy's forces; and, in the evening he encamped with the right at the abbey of Vliers∣beck, and the left before Bie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>beck, under the cannon of Louvain. He detached lieutenant-general Henkelum, the duke of Wirtemberg, and count Oxienstiern, with a considerable body of forces, to attack some posts on the Deule, which were sienderly guarded. Their advanced guard accordingly passed the river, and
<PB N="303" REF="3060"/>
repulsed the enemy; but, for want of timely support they were obliged to pass it and retire. On the third of August baron Spaar, with a body of Dutch troops, marched to Raboth on the canal of Bruges, forced the French lines at Loven∣degen, and took four forts by which they were defended; but receiving advice that the enemy were on their march towards him, he retired to Mildegem, and carried with him several hostages as security for the payment of the contribu∣tions he had raised. On the fifteenth the duke moved from Mildert to Cor∣bais; next day continued his march to Genap, from whence he advanced to Fischermont. On the seventeenth general Overkirk took the post of Waterlo; and next day the confederate army was drawn up in order of battle before the enemy, who extended from Overysche near the wood of Soignies to Neerysche, with the little river Ysche in their front, so as to cover Brussels and Louvain. The duke of Marlborough proposed to attack them immediately before they should recollect themselves from their consternation; and Overkirk approved of the design. But, it was opposed by general Schlangenburgh and other Dutch officers, who represented it in such a light to the deputies of the states, that they refused to concur in the execution. The duke being obliged to relinquish the scheme, wrote an expostulatory letter to the states-general, complaining of their having withdrawn that confidence which they had reposed in him while he acted in Germany. This letter being published at the Hague, excited mur∣murs among the people; and the English nation were incensed at the pre∣sumption of the deputies, who wrote several letters in their own justification to the states-general; but these had no effect upon the populace, by whom the duke was respected even to a degree of adoration. The states being apprised of the resentment that prevailed over all England, and that the earl of Pembroke, lord-president of the council, was appointed as envoy extraordinary to Holland, with instructions to demand satisfaction, thought proper to anticipate his jour∣ney, by making submissions to the duke, and removing Schlangenburgh from his command. The confederate army returned to Corbais, from whence it marched to Perwitz, where it encamped. The little town of Sout-Leewe, situ∣ated in the middle of a morass, and constituting the chief defence of the ene∣my's lines, being taken by a detachment under the command of lieutenant∣general Dedem, the duke ordered the lines from this place to Wasseigne to be levelled, and the town of Tirlemont to be dismantled: then passing the Demer, he encamped on the nineteenth day of September at Arschot. About the latter end of the month he marched to Heventhals: from hence the duke re∣paired to the Hague, where he had several conferences with the pensionary. In a few days he returned to the army, which decamping from Heventhals, marched to Clampthout. On the twenty-fourth day of October the count de Noyelles invested Santvliet, which surrendered before the end of the month.</P>

<P>At this period the duke, in consequence of pressing letters from the emperor, set out for Vienna, in order to concert the operations of the ensuing campaign, and other measures of importance, in which the concerns of the allies were interested. In his way he was magnificently entertained by the elector palatine, and him of Triers, and complimented by the magistracy of Francfort, where he conferred with prince Lewis of Baden. On the twelfth of Novem∣ber he arrived at Vienna, where he was treated with the highest marks of dis∣tinction and cordial friendship by their Imperial majesties. His son-in-law the
<PB N="304" REF="3070"/>
earl of Sunderland, had been sent thither as envoy extraordinary; and, now they conferred together with the emperor and his ministers. They resolved to main∣tain the war with redoubled vigour. The treaties were renewed; and provision made for the security of the duke of Savoy. The emperor, in consideration of the duke's signal service to the house of Austria, presented him with a grant of the lord∣ship of Mindelheim in Suabia, which was now erected into a principality of the Roman empire. In his return with the earl of Sunderland, he visited the courts of Berlin and Hanover, where he was received with that extraordinary respect which was due to his character; and arrived at the Hague on the fourteenth day of December. There he settled the operations of the next campaign with the states-general, who consented to join England in maintaining an additional body of ten thousand men, as a reinforcement to the army of prince Eugene in Italy. While the allies were engaged in the siege of Santvliet, the elector of Bavaria sent a detachment, under the command of Don Marcello de Grimaldi, to invest Diest, the garrison of which were made prisoners of war.</P>

<P>On the Upper Rhine marechal Villars besieged and took Hom∣burg, and passed the Rhine at Strasburg on the sixth day of August. But prince Lewis of Baden arriving in the camp of the Imperialists at Stolhoffen, not only obliged him to retire, but having passed the river, forced the French lines at Hagenau: then he reduced Drusenheim and Hagenau, but attempted no enterprize equal to the number of his army, although the emperor had ex∣postulated with him severely on his conduct; and he had now a fair opportunity of emulating the glory of Marlborough, upon whom he looked with the eyes of an envious rival. In Italy a battle was fought at Casano, between prince Eugene and the duke of Vendome, with dubious success. The duke de Feuil∣lade reduced Chivas, and invested Nice; which, after an obstinate defence, sur∣rendered in December. All the considerable places belonging to the duke of Savoy were now taken, except Coni and Turin; and, his little army was reduced to twelve thousand men, whom he could hardly support. His dutchess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his clergy, and his subjects in general, pressed him to submit to the necessity of his affairs; but he adhered to the alliance with surprising fortitude. He with∣stood the importunities of his dutchess, excluded all the bishops and clergy from his councils; and, when he had occasion for a confessor, chose a priest occasionally, either from the Dominicans or Franciscans. The campaign in Portugal began with a very promising aspect. The allies invaded Spain by the different frontiers of Beyra and Alentejo. Their army, under the command of the Conde das Galveas, undertook the siege of Valencia D'Alcantara in May, and took it by assault: Albuquerque surrendered upon articles; and, then the troops were sent into quarters of refreshment. The marquis de las Minas, who commanded the Portuguese in the province of Beyra, reduced the town of Salva-terra, plundered and burned Sarca; but was obliged to retire to Pena∣macos at the approach of the enemy. Towards the end of September the con∣federates being reassembled, invested Badajox, by the advice of the earl of Gal∣way, who lost his right hand by a cannon-ball, and was obliged to be carried off; so that the conduct of the siege was left to general Fagel. He had made con∣siderable progress towards the reduction of the place, when the marquis de Thesse found means to throw in a powerful reinforcement; and then the con∣federates abandoned the enterprize. The war continued to rage in Hungary

with various success. Ragotski, though frequently worsted, appeared still in arms, and ravaged the country, which became a scene of misery and desolation. In Poland the old cardinal primate owned Stanislaus, but died before the co∣ronation, which was performed by the bishop of Cujavia. In the beginning of winter king Augustus had passed through Poland in disguise to the Muscovite army, which was put under his command in Lithuania; and, the campaign was protracted through the whole winter-season, notwithstanding the severity of the weather in that northern climate. In the spring the Swedish general Rein∣child obtained a complete victory over the Saxon army, which was either cut in pieces, or taken with their camp, baggage, and artillery: yet, the war was not extinguished. The king of Sweden continued obstinately deaf to all pro∣posals of peace, and was become as savage in his manners as brutal in his revenge.</P>

<P>At sea the arms of the allies were generally prosperous. Philip of Spain being obstinately bent upon retaking Gibraltar, sent marechal de Thes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ĕ to renew the siege, while De Pointis was ordered to block up the place by sea with his squadron. These French officers carried on the siege with such activity, that the prince of Hesse dispatched an express to Lisbon with a letter, desiring Sir John Leake to sail immediately to his assistance. This admiral having been reinforced from England by Sir Thomas Dilkes, with five ships of the line and a body of troops, set sail immediately; and, on the tenth day of March descried five ships of war hauling out of the bay of Gibraltar. These were commanded by De Pointis in person, to whom the English admiral gave chace. One of them struck, after having made a very slight resistance; and, the rest ran ashore to the westward of Marbella, where they were destroyed. The remaining part of the French squadron had been blown from their anchors, and taken shelter in the bay of Malaga; but, now they slipped their cables, and made the best of their way to Toulon. The marechal de Thessĕ, in con∣sequence of this disaster, turned the siege of Gibraltar into a blockake, and withdrew the greater part of his forces. While Sir John Leake was employed in this expedition, Sir George Byng, who had been ordered to cruize in sound∣ings for the protection of trade, took a ship of forty guns from the enemy, to∣gether with twelve privateers, and seven vessels richly laden from the West-Indies.</P>

<P>But the most eminent atchievement of this summer was the re∣duction of Barcelona, by the celebrated earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who sailed from St. Helen's in the latter end of May with the English fleet, having on board a body of five thousand land-forces; and, on the twen∣tieth of June arrived at Lisbon, where they were joined by Sir John Leake and the Dutch admiral Allemonde. In a council of war, they determined to put to sea with eight and forty ships of the line, which should be stationed between Cape Spartel and the bay of Cadiz, in order to prevent the junction of the Toulon and Brest squadrons. The prince of Hesse-Darmstadt arriving from Gibraltar, assured king Charles, that the province of Catalonia and the king∣dom of Valencia were attached to his interest; and, his majesty being weary of Portugal, resolved to accompany the earl of Peterborough to Barcelona. He accordingly embarked with him on board of the Ranelagh; and, the fleet sailed on the twenty-eighth day of July, the earl of Galway having reinforced them
<PB N="$06" REF="3090"/>
with two regiments of English dragoons. At Gibraltar they took on board the English guards, and three old regiments, in lieu of which they left two new-raised battalions. On the eleventh day of August they anchored in the bay of Altea, where the earl of Peterborough published a manifesto in the Spanish language, which had such an effect, that all the inhabitants of the place, the neighbouring villages, and adjacent mountains, acknowledged king Charles as their lawful sovereign. They seized the town of Denia for his service; and, he sent thither a garrison of four hundred men under the command of major-general Ramos. On the twenty-second they arrived in the bay of Barcelona: the troops were disembarked to the eastward of the city, where they encamped in a strong situation; and were well received by the country-people. King Charles landed amidst the acclamations of an infinite multitude from the neigh∣bouring towns and villages, who threw themselves at his feet, exclaiming, "Long live the king!" and exhibited all the marks of the most extravagant joy. The inhabitants of Barcelona were well affected to the house of Austria, but overawed by a garrison of five thousand men under the duke de Popoli, Velasco, and other officers devoted to the interest of king Philip. Considering the strength of such a garrison, and the small number of Dutch and English troops, nothing could appear more desperate and dangerous than the design of besieging the place; yet this was proposed by the prince of Hesse-D'Armstadt, who served in the expedition as a volunteer, strongly urged by king Charles, and approved by the earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovel. The city was accordingly invested on one side; but, as a previous step to the reduction of it, they resolved to attack the fort of Montjuic, strongly situated on a hill that commanded the city. The outworks were taken by storm, with the loss of the gallant prince of Hesse, who was shot through the body, and in a few hours expired: then the earl of Peterborough began to bombard the body of the fort; and, a shell chancing to fall into the magazine of powder, blew it up, together with the governor and some of the best officers: an accident which struck such a terror into the garrison, that they surrendered without further resistance.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>This great point being gained, the English general erected his batteries against the town, with the help of the Miquelets and seamen: the bomb-ketches began to fire with such execution, that in a few days the governor capitulated; and, on the fourth day of October king Charles entered in triumph. All the other places in Catalonia declared for him, except Roses; so that the largest and richest province of Spain was conquered with an army scarce double the number of the garrison of Barcelona. King Charles wrote with his own hand a letter to the queen of England, containing a circumstantial detail of his affairs, the warmest expressions of acknowledgment, and the highest encomiums on her subjects, particularly the earl of Peterborough. In a council of war it was deter∣mined, that the king and the earl should continue in Catalonia with the land-forces: that Sir Cloudesley Shovel should return to England: that five and twenty English and fifteen Dutch ships of war should winter at Lisbon, under the command of Sir John Leake and the Dutch rear-admiral Wassenaer: and, that four English and two Dutch frigates should remain at Barcelona. Don Francisco de Velasco was transported to Malaga with about a thousand men of his garrison, the rest voluntarily engaged in the service of king Charles, and six other regiments were raised by the states of Catalonia. The count de Ci∣fuentes,
<PB N="307" REF="3100"/>
at the head of the Miquelets and Catalans attached to the house of Austria, secured Tarragona, Tortosa, Lerida, San-Mattheo, Gironne, and other places. Don Raphael Nevat, revolting from Philip with his whole regiment of horse, joined general Ramos at Denia, and made themselves masters of several places of importance in the kingdom of Valencia. Flushed with such unexpected success they penetrated to the capital of the same name, which they surprised, toge∣ther with the marquis de Villa-Garcia, the viceroy, and the archbishop. These ad∣vantages, however, were not properly improved. The court of Charles was di∣vided into factions, and so much time lost in disputes, that the enemy sent a body of six thousand men into the kingdom of Valencia, under the command of the Conde de las Torres, who forthwith invested San-Mattheo, guarded by colonel Jones at the head of five hundred Miquelets. This being a place of great con∣sequence, on account of its situation, the earl of Peterborough marched thither with one thousand infantry and two hundred dragoons; and, by means of feigned intelligence artfully conveyed to the Conde, induced that general to abandon the siege with precipitation, in the apprehension of being suddenly at∣tacked by a considerable army. He afterwards took possession of Nules, and purchasing horses at Castillon de la Plana, began to form a body of cavalry, which did good service in the sequel. Having assembled a little army, consist∣ing of ten squadrons of horse and dragoons, and four battalions of regular troops, with about three thousand of militia, he marched to Molviedro, which was surrendred to him by the governor brigadier Mahoni. Between this officer and the Spanish general he excited such jealousies by dint of artifices not altogether justifiable even in war, that the duke of Arcos was more intent upon avoiding the supposed treachery of Mahoni than upon interrupting the earl's march to Valentia, where the inhabitants expressed uncommon marks of joy at his arrival. About this period a very obstinate action happened at St. Istevan de Litera, where the chevalier D'Asfeldt with nine squadrons of horse and dragoons, and as many battalions of French infantry, attacked colonel Wills at the head of a small detachment; but, this last being supported by lieutenant-general Cuningham, who was mortally wounded in the engagement, repulsed the enemy, though three times his number, with the loss of four hundred men killed upon the spot. The troops on both sides fought with the most desperate valour, keeping up their fire until the muzzles of their pieces met, and charging each other at the point of bayonet. The only misfortune that attended the English arms in the course of this year was the capture of the Baltic fleet homeward-bound, with their convoy of three ships of war, which were taken by the Dunkirk∣squadron under the command of the count de St. Paul, though he himself was killed in the engagement. When an account of this advantage was communi∣cated to the French king, he replied with a sigh, <Q>“Very well, I wish the ships were safe again in any English port, provided the count de St. Paul could be restored to life.”</Q> After the death of the famous Du Bart; this officer was counted the best <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eaman in France.</P>

<P>The kingdom of England was now wholly engrossed by the election of members for the new parliament. The Tories exerted themselves with great industry, and propagated the cry of the church's being in danger; a cry in which the Jacobites joined with great fervour: but, notwithstanding all their efforts, in word and writing, a majority of Whigs was returned; and
<PB N="308" REF="3110"/>
now the lord Godolphin, who had hitherto maintained a neutrality, thought proper openly to countenance that faction. By his interest co-operating with the influence of the dutchess of Marlborough, Sir Nathan Wright was de∣prived of the great-seal, which was committed to Mr. William Cowper, with the title of lord-keeper. This was a lawyer of good extraction, superior ta∣lents, engaging manners, and eminence in his profession. He was staunch to Whig principles, and for many years had been considered as one of their best speakers in the house of commons. The new parliament meeting on the twenty-fifth day of October, a violent contest arose about the choice of a speaker. Mr. Bromley was supported by the Tories, and the Whigs proposed Mr. John Smith, who was elected by a majority of forty-three voices. The queen in her speech represented the necessity of acting vigorously against France, as a common enemy to the liberties of Europe: she commended the fortitude of the duke of Savoy, which she said was without example: she told them her intention was to expedite commissions for treating of an union with Scot∣land: she earnestly recommended an union of minds and affections among her people: she observed, that some persons had endeavoured to foment animosi∣ties, and even suggested in print, that the established church was in danger: she affirmed that such people were enemies to her and to the kingdom, and meaned only to cover designs which they durst not publicly own, by endea∣vouring to distract the nation with unreasonable and groundless distrusts and jealousies: she declared she would always affectionately support and countenance the church of England, as by law established: that she would inviolably main∣tain the toleration: that she would promote religion and virtue, encourage trade, and every thing else that might make them a happy and flourishing people.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="41" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLI.</HEAD>
<P>The majority in both houses now professed the same principles, and were well disposed to support the queen in all her designs. They first pre∣sented the usual addresses, in the warmest terms of duty and affection. Then the commons drew up a second, assuring her they would, to the utmost of their power, assist her in bringing the treaty of union to a happy conclusion. They desired that the proceedings of the last session of parliament, relating to the union and succession, might be laid before the house. The lords had solli∣cited the same satisfaction; and her majesty promised to comply with their request. The lower-house having heard and decided in some cases of controverted elections, proceeded to take into consideration the estimates for the service of the en∣suing year, and granted the supplies without hesitation. In the house of lords, while the queen was present, lord Haversham, at the end of a long speech, in which he reflected upon the conduct of the duke of Marlborough, both on the Moselle and in Brabant, moved for an address to desire her majesty would invite the presumptive heir to the crown of England, to come and reside in the kingdom. This motion was earnestly supported by the duke of Bucking∣ham, the earls of Rochester, Nottingham, and Anglesey. They said there was no method so effectual to secure the succession, as that of the suc∣cessor's being upon the spot, ready to assume and maintain his or her right against any pretender; and they observed, that in former times, when the throne of England was vacant, the first comer had always succeeded in his pretensions. The proposal was vehemently opposed by the Whigs, who knew
<PB N="309" REF="3120"/>
it was disagreeable to the queen, whom they would not venture to disoblige. They argued, that a rivalry between the two courts might produce distractions, and be attended with very ill consequences; and observed, that the princess Sophia had expressed a full satisfaction in the assurances of the queen, who had promised to maintain her title. The question being put, was carried in the negative by a great majority. The design of the Tories in making this mo∣tion, was to bring the other party in disgrace, either with the queen or with the people. Their joining in the measure would have given umbrage to their sovereign; and, by opposing it, they ran the risque of incurring the public odium, as enemies to the protestant succession: but the pretence of the Tories was so thin, the nation saw through it; and the sole effect the motion pro∣duced, was the queen's resentment against the whole party. Burner, bishop of Sarum, proposed that provision might be made for maintaining the public quiet, in the interval between the queen's decease, and the arrival of her suc∣cessor: the motion was seconded by the lord-treasurer; and a bill brought in for the better security of her majesty's person and government, and of the suc∣cession to the crown of England. By this act, a regency was appointed of the seven persons that should possess the offices of archbishop of Canterbury, lord chancellor or lord-keeper, lord-treasurer, lord-president, lord privy-seal, lord high-admiral, and the lord-chief-justice of the queen's-bench. Their business was to proclaim the next successor through the kingdom of England, and join with a certain number of persons named as regents by the successor, in three lists, to be sealed up and deposited with the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord-keeper, and the minister residentiary of Hanover. It was enacted, That these joint re∣gencies should conduct the administration; and that the last parliament, even though dissolved, should reassemble, and continue sitting for six months after the decease of her majesty. The bill met with a warm opposition from the Tories, and did not pass the upper-house without a protest. It was still further obstructed in the house of commons even by some of the Whig party, who were given to understand that the princess Sophia had expressed an inclination to re∣side in England. Exceptions were likewise taken to that clause in the bill, enacting that the last parliament should be reassembled. They affirmed, that this was inconsistent with part of the act by which the succession was at first settled; for, among other limitations, the parliament had provided, that when the crown should devolve to the house of Hanover, no man, who had either place or pension, should be capable of sitting in the house of commons. After tedious disputes and zealous altercation, they agreed that a certain number of offices should be specified as disqualifying places. This self-denying clause, and some other amendments, produced conferences between the two houses, and at length the bill passed by their mutual assent. Lord Haversham moved for an inquiry into the miscarriages of the last campaign, hoping to find some foundation for censure in the conduct of the duke of Marlborough. But the proposal was rejected as invidious; and the two houses presented an address to the queen, desiring she would preserve a good correspondence among all the confederates. They likewise concurred in repealing the act by which the Scots had been alienated, and all the northern counties alarmed with the apprehension of a rupture between the two nations. The lord Shannon and brigadier Stanhope arriving with an account of the expedition to Catalonia,
<PB N="310" REF="3130"/>
the queen communicated the good news in a speech to both houses, expressing her hope that they would enable her to prosecute the advantages which her arms had acquired. The commons were so well pleased with the tidings, that they forthwith granted two hundred and fifty thousand pounds for her ma∣jesty's proportion in the expence of prosecuting the successes already gained by king Charles III. for the recovery of the monarchy of Spain to the house of Austria. On the fifteenth day of November, the queen gave the royal assent to an act for exhibiting a bill to naturalize the princess Sophia, and the issue of her body.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>These measures being taken, the sixth day of December was ap∣pointed for enquiring into those dangers to which the Tories affirmed the church was exposed; and the queen attended in person to hear the debates on this interesting subject. The earl of Rochester compared the expressions in the queen's speech at the beginning of the session, to the law enacted in the reign of Charles II. denouncing the penalties of treason against those who should call the king a papist: for which reason, he said, he always thought him of that persuasion. He affirmed, that the church's danger arose from the act of security in Scotland, the absence of the successor to the crown, and the practice of occasional conformity. He was answered by lord Hallifax, who, by way of recrimination, observed, that king Charles II. was a roman catholic, at least his brother declared him a papist after his death: that his brother and suc∣cessor was a known roman catholic, yet the church thought herself secure; and those patriots who stood up in its defence were discountenanced and pu∣nished: nay, when that successor ascended the throne, and the church was apparently in the most imminent danger, by the high commission court and otherwise, the nation was then indeed generally alarmed; and every body knew who sat in that court, and entered deeply into the measures which were then pursued. Compton bishop of London declared that the church was in danger, from profaneness, irreligon, and the licentiousness of the press. He complained, that sermons were preached wherein rebellion was counte∣nanced, and resistance to the higher powers encouraged. He alluded to a sermon preached before the lord mayor, by Mr. Hoadley, now bishop of Win∣chester. Burnet of Sarum said the bishop of London was the last man who ought to complain of that sermon; for if the doctrine it contained was not good, he did not know what defence his lordship could make for his appear∣ing in arms at Nottingham. He affirmed the church would be always subject to profaneness and irreligion; but that they were not now so flagrant as they usually had been: he thought the society set up for reformation in London, and other cities, had contributed considerably to the suppression of vice; and he was sure the corporation for propagating the gospel had done a great deal towards instructing men in religion, by giving great numbers of books in practical divinity; by erecting libraries in country parishes; by sending many able divines to the foreign plantations, and founding schools to breed up chil∣dren in the christian knowledge; though to this expence very little had been contributed by those who appeared so wonderfully zealous for the church. The archbishop of York expressed his apprehension of danger from the in∣crease of dissenters; particularly from the many academies they had instituted: he moved that the judges might be consulted with respect to the laws that were in force against such seminaries, and by what means they might be sup∣pressed.
<PB N="311" REF="3140"/>
Lord Wharton moved that the judges might also be consulted about means of suppressing schools and seminaries held by nonjurors; in one of which the sons of a noble lord in that house had been educated. To this sarcasm the archbishop replied, that his sons were indeed taught by Mr. Ellis, a sober, vir∣tuous man; but when he refused the oath of abjuration, they were immediately withdrawn from his instructions. Lord Wharton proceeded to declare, that he had carefully perused a pamphlet intitled "The Memorial," which was said to contain a demonstration that the church was in danger; but all he could learn was, that the duke of Buckingham, the earls of Rochester and Notting∣ham, were out of place: that he remembered some of these noblemen sat in the high-commission court, and then made no complaint of the church's being in danger. Patrick bishop of Ely complained of the heat and passion manifested by the gentlemen belonging to the universities; and of the un∣dutiful behaviour of the clergy towards their bishops. He was seconded by Hough of Litchfield and Coventry, who added, that the inferior clergy ca∣lumniated their bishops, as if they were in a plot to destroy the church, and had compounded to be the last of their order. Hooper of Bath and Wells ex∣patiated on the invidious distinction implied in the terms "High church," and "Low church." The duke of Leeds asserted, that the church could not be safe, without an act against occasional conformity. Lord Somers recapitulated all the arguments which had been used on both sides of the question: he de∣clared his own opinion was, that the nation was happy under a wise and just administration: that for men to raise groundless jealousies at that juncture, could mean no less than an intention to embroil the people at home, and defeat the glorious designs of the allies abroad. The debate being finished, the question was put, Whether the church of England was in danger? and carried in the negative by a great majority: then the house resolved, That the church of England as by law established, which was rescued from the extremest danger by king William III. of glorious memory, is now, by God's blessing, under the happy reign of her majesty, in a most safe and flourishing condition; and that whoever goes about to suggest or insinuate that the church is in danger, under her majesty's administration, is an enemy to the queen, the church, and the kingdom. Next day, the commons concurred in this determination, and joined the lords in an address to the queen, communicating this resolution, beseech∣ing her to take effectual measures for making it public; and also for punish∣ing the authors and spreaders of the seditious and scandalous reports of the church's being in danger. She accordingly issued a proclamation, containing the resolution of the two houses, and offering a reward for discovering the author of the memorial of the church of England, and for apprehending David Edwards, a professed papist, charged upon oath to be the printer and publisher of that libel.</P>

<P>After a short adjournment, a committee of the lower-house pre∣sented the thanks of the commons to the duke of Marlborough, for his great services performed to her majesty and the nation in the last campaign, and for his prudent negotiations with her allies. This nobleman was in such credit with the people, that when he proposed a loan of five hundred thousand pounds to the emperor, upon a branch of his revenue in Silesia, the money was ad∣vanced immediately by the merchants of London. The kingdom was blessed

with plenty: the queen was universally beloved: the people in general were zealous for the prosecution of the war: the forces were well payed: the treasury was punctual; and, though a great quantity of coin was exported for the maintenance of the war, the paper-currency supplied the deficiency so well, that no murmurs were heard, and the public credit flourished both at home and abroad. All the funds being established, one in particular, for two millions and a half by way of annuities, for ninety-nine years, at six and a half per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and all the bills having received the royal assent, the queen went to the house of peers on the nineteenth day of March, where having thanked both houses for the repeated instances of their affection which she had received, she prorogued the parliament to the twenty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>first day of May following<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Among other bi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s passed during this session, was an act for abridging and reforming some proceedings in the common law and in chancery.</NOTE>.

Then they agreed to divers re∣solutions, asserting their right of having what they offered to the upper-house received by his grace and their lordships. In consequence of this dissension the address was dropped, and a stop put to all further communication between the two houses. The dean of Peterborough protested against the irregularities of the lower-house. The queen, in a letter to the archbishop, signified her resolu∣tion to maintain her supremacy, and the due subordination of presbyters to bishops. She expressed her hope that he and his suffragans should act con∣formably to her resolution, in which case they might be assured of the continuance of her f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vour and protection: she required him to impart this declaration to the bishops and clergy, and to prorogue the convocation to such time as should appear most convenient.

in the council-chamber of the Cockpit near Whitehall, which was the place appointed for the conferences. Their commissions being opened and read by the respective secretaries, and introductory speeches being pronounced by the lord-keeper of England and the lord-chancellor of Scotland, they agreed to certain preliminary articles, importing, That all the proposals should be made in writing, and every point, when agreed, reduced to writing: That no points should be obligatory, till all matters should be adjusted in such a manner as would be proper to be laid before the queen and the two parliaments for their approbation: That a committee should be appointed from each commission to revise the minutes of what might pass, before they should be inserted in the books by the respective secretaries; and that all the proceedings during the treaty should be kept secret. The Scots were inclined to a foederal union, like that of the United Provinces: but the English were bent upon an incorpora∣tion, so as that no Scottish parliament should ever have power to repeal the ar∣ticles of the treaty. The lord-keeper proposed, that the two kingdoms of England and Scotland should be for ever united into one realm, by the name of Great-Britain: That it should be represented by one and the same parliament; and, That the succession of this monarchy, failing heirs of her majesty's body, should be according to the limitations mentioned in the act of parliament passed in the reign of king William, intituled, An act for the further limitation of the crown, and the better securing the rights and liberties of the subject. The Scottish commissioners, in order to comply in some measure with the po∣pular clamour of their nation, presented a proposal, implying that the suc∣cession to the crown of Scotland should be established upon the same persons mentioned in the act of king William's reign: That the subjects of Scotland should for ever enjoy all the rights and privileges of the natives in England, and the dominions thereunto belonging; and, That the subjects of England should enjoy the like rights and privileges in Scotland: That there should be a free communication and intercourse of trade and navigation between the two kingdoms, and plantations thereunto belonging; and that all laws and statutes in either kingdom, contrary to the terms of this union, should be repealed. The English commissioners declined entering into any considerations upon these proposals, declaring themselves fully convinced that nothing but an intire union would settle perfect and lasting friendship between the two kingdoms. The Scots acquiesced in this reply, and both sides proceeded in the treaty, with∣out any other intervening dispute. They were twice visited by the queen, who exhorted them to accelerate the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ticles of a treaty that would prove so
<PB N="$$$" REF="3170"/>
advantageous to both kingdoms. At length they were finished, arranged, and mutually signed, on the twenty-second of July, and next day presented to her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the palace of St. James's, by the lord-keeper, in the name of the English commissioners; while at the same time a sealed copy of the instrument was likewise delivered by the lord-chancellor of Scotland; and each made a short oration on the subject, to which the queen returned a very gracious reply. That same day she di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted on order of council, that whoever should be con∣cerned in any discourse or libel, or in laying wagers relating to the union, should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the utmost rigour of the law.</P>

nobleman repaired to Holland in the latter end of April; and conferred with the states-general. Then he assembled the army between Borchloen and Groes-Waren, and found it amounted to seventy-four battalions of foot, and one hundred and twenty-three squadrons of horse and dragoons, well furnished with artillery and pontoons. The court of France having received intelligence, that the Danish and Prussian troops had not yet joined the confederates, ordered the elector of Bavaria and the marechal de Villeroy to attack them before the junc∣tion could be effected. In pursuance of this order they passed the Deule on the nineteenth day of May, and posted themselves at Tirlemont, being superior in number to the allied army. There they were joined by the horse of the army, commanded by marechal Marsin, and encamped between Tirlemont and Ju∣doigne. On Whitsunday, early in the morning, the duke of Marlborough advanced with his army in eight columns towards the village of Ramillies, being by this time joined by the Danes; and, he learned, that the enemy were in march to give him battle. Next day the French generals perceiving the con∣federates so near them, took possession of a strong camp, their right extending to the Tomb of Hautemont on the side of the Mehaigne; their left to Ander∣kirk; and, the village of Ramillies being near their center. The confederate army was drawn up in order of battle, with the right wing near Foltz on the brook of Yause, and the left by the village of Franquenies, which the enemy had occupied. The duke ordered lieutenant-general Schultz, with twelve battalions and twenty pieces of cannon to begin the action, by attacking Ramillies, which was strongly fortified with artillery. At the same time velt∣marechal Overkirk, on the left, commanded colonel Wertmuller, with four battalions and two pieces of cannon, to dislodge the enemy's infantry posted among the hedges of Franquenies. Both these orders were successfully exe∣cuted. The Dutch and Danish horse of the left wing charged with great vi∣gour and intrepidity; but were so roughly handled by the troops of the French king's houshold, that they began to give way, when the duke of Marlborough sustained them with the body of reserve, and twenty squadrons drawn from the right, where a morass prevented them from acting. In the mean time, he in person rallied some of the broken squadrons, in order to renew the charge, when his own horse falling, he was surrounded by the enemy, and must have been either killed or taken prisoner, had not a body of infantry come seasonably to his relief. When he remounted his horse, the head of colonel Brienfield, his gentleman of the horse, was carried off by a cannon-ball while he held the duke's stirrup. Before the reinforcement arrived, the best part of the French mousquetaires were cut in pieces. All the troops posted in Ramillies were either killed or taken. The rest of the enemy's infantry began to retreat in to∣lerable order, under cover of the cavalry on their left wing, which formed themselves in three lines between Ossuz and Anderkirk; but, the English horse having found means to pass the rivulet which divided them from the enemy, sell upon them with such impetuosity, that they abandoned their foot, and were terribly slaughtered in the village of Anderkirk. They now gave way on all sides. The horse fled three different ways; but, were so closely pursued, that very few escaped. The elector of Bavaria and the marechal de Vill<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roy saved themselves with the utmost difficulty. Several waggons of the enemy's vanguard breaking down in a narrow pass, obstructed the way in such a manner,
<PB N="318" REF="3210"/>
that the baggage and artillery could not proceed; nor could their troops defile in order. The victorious horse being informed of this accident, pressed on them so vigorously, that great numbers threw down their arms and submitted. The pursuit was followed thro' Judoigne till two o'clock in the morning, five leagues from the field of battle, and within two of Louvaine. In a word, the confederates obtained a complete victory. They took the enemy's baggage and artillery, about one hundred and twenty colours or standards, six hundred officers, six thousand private soldiers; and about eight thousand were killed or wounded. Prince Maximilian, and prince Monbason lost their lives; the major-generals Palavicini and Mezieres were taken, together with the marquisses de Bar, de Nonant, and de la Baume, son of the marechal de Tallard, monsieur de Montmorency, nephew to the duke of Luxembourg; and many other persons of distinction. The loss of the allies did not exceed three thousand men, including prince Lewis of Hesse and Mr. Bentinck, who were slain in the engagement. The French generals retired with precipitation to Brussels, while the allies took possession of Louvaine, and next day encamped at Bethlem. The battle of Ra∣millies was attended with the immediate conquest of all Brabant. The cities of Louvaine, Mechlin, Brussels, Antwerp, Ghent, and Bruges, submitted with∣out resistance, and acknowledged king Charles. Ostend, though secured by a strong garrison, was surrendered after a siege of ten days. Menin, esteemed the most finished fortification in the Netherlands, and guarded by six thousand men, met with the same fate. The garrison of Dendermonde surrendered themselves prisoners of war; and Aeth submitted on the same conditions. The French troops were dispirited. The city of Paris was overwhelmed with consternation: Lewis affected to bear his misfortunes with calmness and composure: but, the constraint had such an effect upon his constitution, that his physicians thought it necessary to prescribe frequent bleeding, which he accordingly underwent. At his court no mention was made of military transactions: all was solemn, silent, and reserved.</P>

<P>Had the issue of the campaign in Catalonia been such as the begin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing seemed to prognosticate, the French king might have in some measure con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oled himself for his disgraces in the Netherlands. On the sixth day of April King Phi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip, at the head of a numerous army, undertook the siege of Barcelona, while the count de Thoulouse blocked it up with a powerful squadron. The inha∣bitants, animated by the presence of king Charles, made a vigorous defence; and, the garrison was reinforced with some troops from Gironne and other places. But, after the sort of Montjuic was taken, the place was so hard pressed, that Charles ran the utmost risque of falling into the hands of the enemy; for, the earl of Peterborough, who had marched from Valencia with two thousand men, found it impracticable to enter the city. Nevertheless, he maintained his post upon the hills; and, with surprising courage and activity kept the besiegers in continual alarm. At length, Sir John Leake sailed from Lisbon with thirty ships of the line; and, on the eighth day of May arrived in sight of Barcelona. The French admiral no sooner received intelligence of his approach, than he set sail for Toulon. In three days after his departure king Philip abandoned the siege, and retired in great disorder, leaving behind his tents, with the sick and wounded. On the side of Portugal the duke of Berwick was left with such an inconsiderable force as proved insufficient to defend the frontiers. The earl of
<PB N="319" REF="3220"/>
Galway, with an army of twenty thousand men, undertook the siege of Alcantara; and, in three days the garrison, consisting of four thousand men, were made pri∣soners of war. Then he marched to Placentia, and advanced as far as the bridge of Almaras; but, the Portuguese would penetrate no farther until they should know the fate of Barcelona. When they understood the siege was raised, they consented to proceed to Madrid. Philip, guessing their intention, posted to that capital, and sent his queen with all his valuable effects to Burgos, whither he followed her in person, after having destroyed every thing that he could not carry away. About the latter end of June the earl of Galway entered the city without resistance; but, the Spaniards were extremely mortified to see an army of Portuguse, headed by an heretic, in possession of their capital. King Charles loitered away his time in Barcelona, until his competitor recovered his spirits, and received such reinforcements as enabled him to return to Madrid, with an army equal to that commanded by the earl of Galway. This general made a motion towards Arragon, in order to facilitate his conjunction with Charles, who had set out by the way of Saragossa, where he was acknowledged as sovereign of Arragon and Valencia. In the beginning of August he arrived at the Por∣tuguese camp, with a small reinforcement; and, in a few days was followed by the earl of Peterborough, at the head of five hundred dragoons. The two armies were now pretty equal in point of number; but, as each expected further reinforcements, neither chose to hazard an engagement. The earl of Peter∣borough, who aspired to the chief command, and hated the prince of Lich∣tenstein, who enjoyed the confidence of king Charles, retired in disgust; and, embarking on board of an English ship of war, set sail for Genoa. The Eng∣lish fleet continued all the summer in the Mediterranean: they secured Cartha∣gena, which had declared for Charles: they took the town of Alicant by assault, and the castle by capitulation. Then sailing out of the Streights, one squadron was detached to the West-Indies, another order to lie at Lisbon, and the rest were sent home to England.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Fortune was not more propitious to the French in Italy than in Flan∣ders. The duke of Vendome having been called to assume the command in Flanders after the battle of Ramillies, the duke of Orleans was placed at the head of the army in Piedmont, under the tutorage and direction of the mare∣chal de Marsin. They were ordered to besiege Turin, which was accordingly invested in the month of May; and, the operations carried on till the beginning of September. Great preparations had been made for this siege. It was not undertaken until the duke of Savoy had rejected all the offers of the French monarch, which were sufficient to have shaken a prince of less cou∣rage and fortitude. The duke de la Feuillade having finished the lines of circum∣vallation and contravallation, sent his quarter-master general with a trumpet, to offer passports and a guard for the removal of the dutchess and her children. The duke of Savoy replied, that he did not intend to remove his family; and, that the marechal might begin to execute his master's orders whenever he should think fit: but, when the siege began with uncommon fury, and the French fired red-hot balls into the place, the two dutchesses, with the young prince and prin∣cesses, quitted Tur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and retired to Quierasco, from whence they were cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cted through many dangers into the territories of Genoa. The duke himself forsook his capital, in order to put himself at the head of his cavalry; and, was pursued
<PB N="320" REF="3230"/>
from place to place by five and forty squadrons, under the command of the count D'Aubeterre. Notwithstanding the very noble defence which was made by the garrison of Turin, who destroyed fourteen thousand of the enemy during the course of the siege, the defences were almost ruined, their ammunition began to fail, and they had no prospect of relief but from prince Eugene, who had numberless difficulties to encounter before he could march to their assistance. The duke of Vendome, before he left Italy, had secured all the fords of the Adige, the Mincio, and the Oglio, and formed such lines and intrenchments as he imagined would effectually hinder the Imperial general from arriving in time to relieve the city of Turin. But the prince surmounted all opposition, passed four great rivers in despite of the enemy; and reached the neighbourhood of Turin on the thirteenth day of August. There being joined by the duke of Savoy, he passed the Po between Montcalier and Cavignan. On the fifth day of Sep∣tember they took a convoy of eight hundred loaded mules: next day they passed the Doria, and encamped with the right on the bank of that river before Pia∣nessa, and the left on the Stura before the Veneria. The enemy were intrenched, having the Stura on their right, the Doria on their left, and the convent of ca∣puchins, called Notre Dame de la Campagne, in their center. When prince Eugene approached Turin, the duke of Orleans proposed to march out of the intrench∣ments, and give him battle; and this proposal was seconded by all the general-officers, except Marsin, who, finding the duke determined, produced an order from the French king, commanding the duke to follow the marechal's advice. The court of Versailles was now become afraid of hazarding an engagement against those who had so often defeated their armies; and this officer had pri∣vate instructions to keep within the trenches. On the seventh day of September the confederates marched up to the intrenchments of the French, in eight co∣lumns, through a terrible fire from forty pieces of artillery, and were formed in order of battle within half-cannon shot of the enemy. Then they advanced to the attack with surprising resolution, and met with such a warm reception as seemed to stop their progress. Prince Eugene perceiving this check, drew his sword, and putting himself at the head of the battalions on the left, forced the intrenchments at the first charge. The duke of Savoy met with the same suc∣cess in the center, and on the right near Luscingo. The horse advanced thro' the intervals of the foot, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t for that purpose; and breaking in with vast impe∣tuosity, completed the confusion of the enemy, who were defeated on all hands, and retired with precipitation to the other side of the Po, while the duke of Savoy entered his capital in triumph. The duke of Orleans exhibited repeated proofs of the most intrepid courage; and received several wounds in the engage∣ment. Marechal de Marsin fell into the hands of the victors, his thigh being shat∣tered with a ball, and died in a few hours after the amputation. Of the French army about five thousand men were slain on the field of battle: a great number of officers, and upwards of seven thousand men were taken, together with two hundred and fifty-five pieces of cannon, one hundred and eighty mortars, an incredible quantity of ammunition, all the tents and baggage, five thousand beasts of burthen, ten thousand horses belonging to thirteen regiments of dra∣goons, and the mules of the commissary-general so richly laden, that this part of the booty alone was valued at three millions of livres. The loss of the confederates
<PB N="321" REF="3240"/>
did not exceed three thousand men killed or disabled in the action, besides about the same number of the garrison of Turin, which had fallen since the beginning of the siege. This was such a fatal stroke to the interest of Lewis, that madame de Maintenon would not venture to make him fully acquainted with the state of his affairs. He was told, that the duke of Orleans had raised the siege of Turin at the approach of prince Eugene; but he knew not that his own army was defeated and ruined. The spirits of the French were a little comforted in consequence of an advantage gained about this time, by the count de Medavy-grancey, who commanded a body of troops left in the Mantuan ter∣ritories. He surprised the prince of Hesse in the neighbourhood of Castiglione, and obliged him to retire to the Adige with the loss of two thousand men; but this victory was attended with no consequence in their favour. The duke of Orleans retreated into Dauphine, while the French garrisons were driven out of every place they occupied in Piedmont and Italy, except Cremona, Valenza, and the castle of Milan, which were blocked up by the confederates.</P>

<P>Over and above these disasters which the French sustained in the course of this campaign, they were miserably alarmed by the project of an invasion from Britain, formed by the marquis de Guiscard, who, actuated by a family-disgust, had abandoned his country, and become a partisan of the confederates. He was declared a lieutenant-general in the emperor's army, and came over to London, after having settled a correspondence with the malcontents in the southern parts of France. He insinuated himself into the friendship of Henry St. John, secretary of war, and other persons of distinction. His scheme of in∣vading France was approved by the British ministry; and he was promoted to the command of a regiment of dragoons destined for that service. About eleven thousand men were embarked under the conduct of earl Rivers, with a large train of artillery; and the combined squadrons, commanded by Sir Cloudesley Shovel, set sail from Plymouth on the thirteenth day of August. Next day they were forced into Torbay by contrary winds; and there they held a council of war to concert their operations, when they discovered, that Guiscard's plan was altogether chimerical, or at least founded upon such slight assurances and conjectures, as could not justify their proceeding to execution. An express was immediately dispatched to the admiralty, with the result of this council; and, in the mean time, letters arrived at court from the earl of Galway, after his re∣treat from Madrid to Valencia, solliciting succours with the most earnest in∣treaties. The expedition to France was immediately postponed; and Sir Cloudesley Shovel was ordered to make the best of his way for Lisbon, there to take such measures as the state of the war in Spain should render necessary. Guiscard and his officers being set on shore, the fleet sailed with the first fair wind, and towards the latter end of October arrived at Lisbon. On the twenty∣eighth day of the next month the king of Portugal died, and his eldest son and suc∣cessor being but eighteen years of age, was even more than his father influenced by a ministry, which had private connexions with the court of Versailles. Ne∣vertheless, Sir Cloudesley Shovel and earl Rivers, being pressed by letters from king Charles and the earl of Galway, sailed to their assistance in the beginning of January; and on the twenty-eighth arrived at Alicant, from whence the earl of Rivers proceeded by land to Valencia, in order to assist at a general council of war. The operations of the ensuing campaign being concerted, and the
<PB N="322" REF="3250"/>
army joined by the reinforcement from England, earl Rivers disliking the country, returned with the admiral to Lisbon.</P>

<P>Poland was at length delivered from the presence of the king of Sweden, who in the beginning of September suddenly marched through Lusatia into Saxony; and in a little time layed that whole electorate under contribution. Augustus being thus cut off from all resource, resolved to obtain peace on the Swede's own terms, and engaged in a secret treaty for this purpose. In the mean time the Poles and Muscovites attacked the Swedish forces at Kalish in Great Poland; and by dint of number routed them with great slaughter. Not∣withstanding this event, Augustus ratified the treaty, by which he acknow∣ledged S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anislaus as true and rightful king of Poland, reserving to himself no more than the empty title of sovereign. The confederates were not a little alarmed to find Charles in the heart of Germany; and the French court did not said to court his alliance: but he continued on the reserve against all their sol∣licitations. Then they implored his mediation for a peace; and he answered, that he would interpose his good offices, as soon as he should know they would be agreeable to the powers engaged in the grand alliance.</P>

<P>The pride of Lewis was now humbled to such a degree as might have ex∣cited the compassion of his enemies. He employed the elector of Bavaria to write letters in his name to the duke of Marlborough and the deputies of the states-general, containing proposals for opening a congress. He had already tampered with the Dutch, in a memorial presented by the marquis D'Alegre. He likewise besought the pope to interpose in his behalf. He offered to cede either Spain and the West-Indies, or Milan, Naples, and Sicily to king Charles; to give up a barrier for the Dutch in the Netherlands; and to indemnify the duke of Savoy for the ravages that had been committed in his dominions. Though his real aim was peace, yet he did not despair of being able to excite such jealousies among the confederates, as might shake the basis of their union. His hope was not altogether disappointed. The court of Vienna was so much alarmed at the offers he had made, and the reports circulated by his emissaries, that the emperor resolved to make himself master of Naples before the allies should have it in their power to close with the proposals of France. This was the true mo∣tive of his concluding a treaty with Lewis in the succeeding winter, by which the Milanese was entirely evacuated, and the French king at liberty to employ those troops in making strong efforts against the confederates in Spain and the Nether∣lands. The Dutch were intoxicated with success, and their pensionary Heinsius entirely influenced by the duke of Marlborough, who found his account in the continuance of the war, which at once gratified his avarice and ambition; for, all his great qualities were obscured by the sordid passion of accumulating wealth. During the whole war the allies never had such an opportunity as they now enjoyed, to bridle the power of France effectually, and secure the liberties of the empire; and indeed, if their real design was to establish an equal ba∣lance between the houses of Austria and Bourbon, it could not have been better effected than by dividing the Spanish monarchy between these two po∣tentates. The accession of Spain, with all its appendages, to either, would have destroyed the aequilibrium which the allies proposed to establish. But, other motives contributed to a continuation of the war. The powers of the confederacy were fired with the ambition of making conquests; and England
<PB N="323" REF="3260"/>
in particular thought herself intitled to an indemnification for the immense sums she had expended. Animated by these concurring considerations, queen Anne and the states-general rejected the offers of France; and declared, that they would not enter into any negotiation for peace, except in concert with their allies.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The Tories of England began to meditate schemes of opposition against the duke of Marlborough. They looked upon him as a selfish noble∣man, who sacrificed the interest of the nation in protracting a ruinous war for his own private advantage. They saw their country oppressed with an increas∣ing load of taxes, which they apprehended would in a little time become an in∣tolerable burden; and they did not doubt but at this period such terms might be obtained as would fully answer the great purpose of the confederacy. This, indeed, was the prevailing opinion among all the sensible people of the nation who were not particularly interested in the prosecution of the war, either by being connected with the general, or in some shape employed in the management of the finances. The Tories were likewise instigated by a party-spirit against Marlborough, who, by means of his wife, was in full possession of the queen's confidence, and openly patronized the Whig faction. But, the attention of people in general was now turned upon the Scottish parliament, which took into consideration the treaty of union lately concluded between the commissioners of both king∣doms. On the third day of October the duke of Queensberry, as high-com∣missioner, produced the queen's letter, in which she expressed her hope, that the terms of the treaty would be acceptable to her parliament of Scotland. She said, an intire and perfect union would be the solid foundation of a lasting peace: it would secure their religion, liberty, and property, remove the animosities that prevailed among themselves, and the jealousies that subsisted between the two nations. It would increase their strength, riches, and commerce: the whole island would be joined in affection, and free from all apprehension of different interests: it would be enabled to resist all its enemies, support the protestant interest every where, and maintain the liberties of Europe. She renewed her assurance of maintaining the government of their church; and told them, that now they had an opportunity of taking such steps as might be necessary for its security after the union. She demanded the necessary supplies. She observed, that the great success with which God Almighty had blessed her arms, afforded the nearer prospect of a happy peace, with which they would enjoy the full advantages of this union; that they had no reason to doubt but the parlia∣ment of England would do all that should be necessary on their part, to con∣firm the union; and she recommended calmness and unanimity in deliberat∣ing on this great and weighty affair, of such consequence to the whole island of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>Hitherto the articles of the union had been industriously concealed from the knowledge of the people: but, the treaty being recited in parliament, and the particulars divulged, such a flame was kindled through the whole na∣tion, as had not appeared since the restoration. The cavaliers or Jacobites had always foreseen, that this union would extinguish all their hopes of a revolution in favour of a pretender. The nobility found themselves degraded in point of dignity and influence, by being excluded from their seats in parliament. The trading part of the nation beheld their commerce saddled with heavy duties and restrictions, and considered the privilege of trading to the English plantations
<PB N="324" REF="3270"/>
as a precarious and uncertain prospect of advantage. The barons or gentlemen were exasperated at a coalition, by which their parliament was annihilated and their credit destroyed. The people in general exclaimed, that the dignity of their crown was betrayed: that the independency of their nation had fallen a sacrifice to treachery and corruption: that whatever conditions might be spe∣ciously offered, they could not expect they would be observed by a parliament in which the English had such a majority. They exaggerated the dangers to which the constitution of their church would be exposed from a bench of bishops, and a parliament of episcopalians. This consideration alarmed the presbyterian ministers to such a degree, that they employed all their power and credit in waking the resentment of their hearers against the treaty, which produced an universal ferment among all ranks of people. Even the most rigid puritans joined the cavaliers in expressing their detestation of the union; and, laying aside their mutual animosities, promised to co-operate in opposing a measure so ignominious and prejudicial to their country. In parliament the opposition was headed by the dukes of Hamilton and Athol, and the marquis of Annan∣dale. The first of these noblemen had wavered so much in his conduct, that it is difficult to ascertain his real political principles. He was generally sup∣posed to favour the claim of the pretender; but he was afraid of embarking too far in his cause, and avoided violent measures in the discussion of this treaty, lest he should incur the resentment of the English parliament, and forfeit the estate he possessed in that kingdom. Athol was more forward in his professions of attachment to the court of St. Germain's; but, he had less ability, and his zeal was supposed to have been inflamed by resentment against the ministry. The debates upon the different articles of the treaty were carried on with great heat and vivacity; and many shrewd arguments were used against this scheme of an incorporating union. One member affirmed, that it would furnish a handle to any aspiring prince to overthrow the liberties of all Britain; for, if the parliament of Scotland could alter, or rather subvert its constitution, this circumstance might be a precedent for the parliament of Great-Britain to assume the same power: that the representatives for Scotland would, from their poverty, depend upon those who possessed the means of corruption; and, having ex∣pressed so little concern for the support of their own constitution, would pay very little regard to that of any other. <Q>“What! (said the duke of Hamilton) shall we in half an hour give up what our forefathers maintained with their lives and fortunes for many ages? Are here none of the descendants of those worthy patriots, who defended the liberty of their country against all in∣vaders; who assisted the great king Robert Bruce to restore the constitu∣tion, and revenge the falshood of England and usurpation of Baliol? Where are the Douglasses and Campbells? Where are the peers, where are the ba∣rons, once the bulwark of the nation? Shall we yield up the sovereignty and independency of our country, when we are commanded by those we repre∣sent, to preserve the same, and assured of their assistance to support us?”</Q> The duke of Athol protested against an incorporating union, as contrary to the ho∣nour, interest, fundamental laws, and constitution of the kingdom of Scotland, the birthright of the peers, the rights and privileges of the barons and bo∣roughs, and to the claim of right, property, and liberty of the subjects. To this protest nineteen peers and forty-six commoners adhered. The earl mares∣chal entered a protest, importing, that no person being successor to the crown
<PB N="325" REF="3280"/>
of England should inherit that of Scotland, without such previous limitations as might secure the honour and sovereignty of the Scottish crown and king∣dom, the frequency and power of parliament, the religion, liberty, and trade of the nation, from English or any foreign influence. He was seconded by six and forty members. With regard to the third article of the union, stipulating, that both kingdoms should be represented by one and the same parliament, the country-party observed, that by assenting to this expedient, they did in effect sink their own constitution, while that of England underwent no alteration: that in all nations there are fundamentals which no power whatever can alter: that the rights and privileges of parliament being one of these fundamentals among the Scots, no parliament, or any other power could ever legally prohibit the meeting of parliaments, or deprive any of the three estates of its right of sitting or voting in parliament, or give up the rights and privileges of parlia∣ment: but, that by this treaty the parliament of Scotland was intirely abrogated, its rights and privileges sacrificed, and those of the English parliament substi∣tuted in their place. They argued, that though the legislative power in parlia∣ment was regulated and determined by a majority of voices; yet the giving up the constitution, with the rights and privileges of the nation, was not subject to suffrage, being founded on dominion and property; and therefore could not be legally surrendered without the consent of every person who had a right to elect and be represented in parliament. They affirmed, that the obligation layed on the Scottish members to reside so long in London in attendance on the British parliament, would drain Scotland of all its money, impoverish the members, and subject them to the temptation of being corrupted. Another protest was entered by the marquis of Annandale against an incorporating union, as being odious to the people, subversive of the constitution, sovereignty, and claim of right, and threatening ruin to the church as by law established. Fifty-two mem∣bers joined in this protestation. Almost every article produced the most inflam∣matory disputes. The lord Belhaven enumerated the mischiefs which would attend the union, in a pathetic speech that drew tears from the audience, and is at this day looked upon as a prophecy by great part of the Scottish nation. Ad∣dresses against the treaty were presented to parliament by the convention of bo∣roughs, the commissioners of the general-assembly, the company trading to Africa and the Indies, as well as from several shires, stewartries, boroughs, towns, and parishes, in all the different parts of the kingdom, without distinc∣tion of Whig or Tory, episcopalian or presbyterian. The earl of Buchan for the peers, Lockhart of Carnwath for the barons, Sir Walter Stuart in behalf of the peers, barons, and boroughs; the earls of Errol and Mareschal for themselves, as high-constable and earl-marshal of the kingdom, protested severally against the treaty of union.</P>

<P>While this opposition raged within doors, the resentment of the people rose to transports of fury and revenge. The more rigid presbyterians, known by the name of Cameronians, chose officers, formed themselves into regiments, provided horses, arms, and ammunition, and marching to Dumfries, burned the articles of the union at the market-cross, justify∣ing their conduct in a public declaration. They made a tender of their attachment to duke Hamilton, from whom they received encouragement in secret. They reconciled themselves to the episcopalians and the cavaliers.
<PB N="326" REF="3290"/>
They resolved to take the route to Edinburgh, and dissolve the parliament; while the duke of Athole undertook to secure the pass of Stirling with his Highlanders, so as to open the communication between the western and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthern parts of the kingdom. Seven or eight thousand men were actually ready to appear in arms at the town of Hamilton, and march directly to Edin∣burgh <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nder the duke's command; when that nobleman altered his opinion, and dispatched private couriers through the whole country, requiring the people to defer their meeting till further directions. The more sanguine ca∣val<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs accused his grace of treachery; but in all likelihood he was actuated by prudential motives. He alledged, in his own excuse, that the nation was not in a condition to carry on such an enterprize, especially as the English had al∣ready det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched troops to the border, and might in a few days wast over a considerable reinforcement from Holland. During this commotion among the Cameronians, the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow were filled with tu∣mults. Sir Patrick Johnston provost of Edinburgh, who had been one of the commissioners for the union, was besieged in his own house by the populace, and would have been torn in pieces, had not the guards dispersed the multi∣tude. The privy-council issued a proclamation against riots, commanding all persons to retire from the streets whenever the drum should beat; ordering the guards to fire upon those who should disobey this command, and indemnify∣ing them from all prosecution for maiming or slaying the lieges. These guards were placed all round the house in which the peers and commons were as∣sembled, and the council received the thanks of the parliament for having thus provided for their safety. Notwithstanding these precautions of the govern∣ment, the commissioner was constantly saluted with the curses and imprecations of the people as he passed along: his guards were pelted; and some of his at∣tendants wounded with stones as they sat by him in the coach, so that he was obliged to pass through the streets at the full gallop.</P>

<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Against all this national fury, the dukes of Queensberry and Argyle, the earls of Montrose, Seafield, and Stair, and the other noblemen attached to the union, acted with equal prudence and resolution. They argued stre∣n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>usly against the objections that were started in the house. They magnified the advantages that would accrue to the kingdom from the privilege of trading to the English plantations, and being protected in their commerce by a powerful navy; as well as from the exclusion of a popish pretender, who they knew was odious to the nation in general. They found means, partly by their promises, and partly by corruption, to bring over the earls of Roxburgh and Marchmont, with the whole squadrone, who had hitherto been unpropi∣tious to the court. They disarmed the resentment of the clergy, by promot∣ing an act to be inserted in the union, declaring the presbyterian discipline to be the only government of the church of Scotland, unalterable in all suc∣ceeding times, and a fundamental article of the treaty. They soothed the African company with the prospect of being indemnified for the losses they had su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ained. They amused individuals with the hope of sharing the rest of the equivalent. They employed emissaries to allay the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erment among the Cameronians, and disunite them from the cavaliers, by canting, praying, and demonstrating the absurdity, sinfulness, and danger, of such a coalition. These remonstrances were reinforced by the sum of twenty thousand pounds, which
<PB N="327" REF="3300"/>
the queen privately lent to the Scottish treasury, and which was now distri∣buted by the ministry in such a manner as might best conduce to the success of the treaty. By these practices they diminished, though they could not silence, the clamour of the people, and obtained a considerable majority in parliament, which out-voted all opposition. Not but that the duke of Queens∣berry at one time despaired of succeeding, and being in continual apprehen∣sion for his life, expressed a desire of adjourning the parliament, until by time and good management he should be able to remove those difficulties that then seemed to be unsurmountable. But the lord-treasurer Godolphin, who fore∣saw that the measure would be intirely lost by delay, and was no judge of the difficulties, insisted upon his proceeding. It was at this period that he re∣mitted the money, and gave directions for having forces ready at a call, both in England and Ireland. At length the Scottish parliament approved and ra∣tified all the articles of the union, with some small variation. Then they pre∣pared an act for regulating the election of the sixteen peers and forty-five com∣moners to represent Scotland in the British parliament. This being touched with the sceptre, the three estates proceeded to elect their representatives. The remaining part of the session was employed in making regulations concerning the coin, in examining the accounts of their African company, and providing for the due application of the equivalent, which was scandalously misapplied<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> On the twenty-fifth day of March the commissioner adjourned the parlia∣ment, after having in a short speech taken notice of the honour they had acquired in concluding an affair of such importance to their country. Having thus accomplished the great purpose of the court, he set out for London, in the neighbourhood of which he was met by above forty noble∣men in their coaches, and about four hundred gentlemen on horseback. Next day he waited upon the queen at Kenfington, from whom he met with a very gracious reception. Perhaps there is not another instance upon record of a ministry's having carried a point of this importance against such a violent torrent of opposition, and contrary to the general sense and inclination of a whole exasperated people. The Scots were persuaded that their trade would be destroyed, their nation oppressed, and their country ruined, in consequence of the union with England; and indeed their opinion was supported by very plausible arguments. The majority of both nations believed that the treaty would produce violent convulsions, or at best prove ineffectual. But we now see it has been attended with none of the calamities that were prognosticated; that it quietly took effect, and fully answered all the purposes for which it was intended. Hence we may learn, that many great difficulties are surmounted, because they are not seen by those who direct the operation; and that many schemes which theory deems impracticable, will yet succeed in the experi∣ment.</P>

<P>The English parliament assembling on the third day of December, the queen, in her speech to both houses, congratulated them on the glorious successes of her arms. She desired the commons would grant such supplies as might enable her to improve the advantages of this successful campaign. She told them that the treaty of union, as concluded by the commissioners of both kingdoms, was at that time under the consideration of the Scottish parliament; and she recommended dispatch in the public affairs, that both friends and enemies
<PB N="328" REF="3310"/>
might be convinced of the firmness and vigour of their proceedings. The parliament was perfectly well disposed to comply with all her majesty's re∣quests. Warm addresses were presented by both houses. Then they pro∣ceeded to the consideration of the supply, and having examined the estimates in less than a week, voted near six millions for the service of the ensuing year. Nevertheless, in examining the accounts, some objections arose. They found that the extraordinary supplies for the support of king Charles of Spain, amounted to eight hundred thousand pounds more than the sums provided by parliament. Some members argued that very ill consequences might ensue, if a ministry could thus run the nation in debt, and expect the parliament should pay the money. The courtiers answered, that if any thing had been raised without necessity or ill applied, it was reasonable that those who were in fault should be punished: but, as this expence was incurred to improve advan∣tages, at a time when the occasion could not be communicated to parliament, the ministry was rather to be applauded for their zeal, than condemned for their liberality. The question being put, the majority voted that those sums had been expended for the preservation of the duke of Savoy, for the interest of king Charles against the common enemy, and for the safety and honour of the na∣tion. When the speaker presented the money-bills, he told her, that as the glorious victory obtained by the duke of Marlborough at Ramillies was fought before it could be supposed the armies were in the field, so it was no less sur∣prising that the commons had granted supplies to her majesty, before the enemy could well know that the parliament was sitting. The general was again ho∣noured with the thanks of both houses. The lords, in an address, besought the queen to settle his honours on his posterity. An act was passed for this purpose; and, in pursuance of another address from the commons, a pension of five thousand pounds out of the post-office was settled upon him and his descendents. The lords and commons having adjourned themselves to the last day of December, the queen closed the year with triumphal processions. As the standards and colours taken at Blenheim had been placed in Westmin∣ster-hall, so now those that had been brought from the field of Ramillies were put up in Guildhall, as trophies of that victory. About this time, the earls of Kent, Lindsey, and Kingston, were raised to the rank of marquisses. The lords Wharton, Poulet, Godolphin, Cholmondely, were created earls. Lord Walden, son and heir apparent to the earl of Suffolk, obtained the title of earl of Bindon; the lord-keeper Cowper and Sir Thomas Pelham were ennobled as barons.</P>

<P>The parliament being assembled after their short recess, the earl of Nottingham moved for an address to the queen, desiring her majesty would order the proceedings of the commissioners for the union, as well as those of the Scottish parliament on the said subject, to be laid before them. He was seconded by the duke of Buckingham and the earl of Rochester; and answered by the earl of Godolphin, who told them they needed not doubt but that her majesty would communicate those proceedings, as soon as the Scottish parlia∣ment should have discussed the subject of the union. The lords Wharton, Somers, and Hallifax, observed, that it was for the honour of the nation that the treaty of union should first come ratified from the parliament of Scotland; and that then, and not before, it would be a proper time for the lords to take
<PB N="329" REF="3320"/>
it into consideration. On the twenty-eighth day of January, the queen in person told both houses, that the treaty of union, with some additions and alterations, was ratified by an act of the Scottish parliament: that she had ordered it to be laid before them, and hoped it would meet with their con∣currence and approbation. She desired the commons would provide for the payment of the equivalent, in case the treaty should be approved. She ob∣served to both houses, that now they had an opportunity of putting the last hand to a happy union of the two kingdoms; and that she should look upon it as a particular happiness, if this great work, which had been so often at∣tempted without success, could be brought to perfection in her reign. When the commons formed themselves into a committee of the whole house, to de∣liberate on the articles of the union, and the Scottish act of ratification, the Tory party, which was very weak in that assembly, began to start some ob∣jections. Sir John Packington disapproved of this incorporating union, which he likened to a marriage with a woman against her consent. He said it was an union carried on by corruption and bribery within doors, by force and vio∣lence without: that the promoters of it had basely betrayed their trust, in giving up their independent constitution, and he would leave it to the judg∣ment of the house, to consider whether or no men of such principles were fit to be admitted into their house of representatives. He observed, that her majesty, by the coronation-oath, was obliged to maintain the church of Eng∣land as by law established; and likewise bound by the same oath to defend the presbyterian kirk of Scotland in one and the same kingdom. Now (said he) after this union is in force, who shall administer this oath to her majesty? It is not the business of the Scots, who are incapable of it, and no well-wishers to the church of England. It is then only the part of the bishops to do it; and can it be supposed that those reverend persons will, or can act a thing so con∣trary to their own order and institution, as thus to promote the establishment of the presbyterian church-government in the united kingdom. He added, that the church of England being established jure divino, and the Scots pre∣tending that the kirk was also jure divino, he could not tell how two nations that clashed in so essential a point could unite: he therefore thought it proper to consult the convocation about this critical point. A motion was made, that the first article of the treaty, which implies a peremptory agreement to an in∣corporating union should be postponed; and that the house should proceed to the consideration of the terms of the intended union, contained in the other articles. This proposal being rejected, some Tory members quitted the house; and all the articles were examined and approved without further opposition. The Whigs were so eager in the prosecution of this point, that they proceeded in a very superficial manner, and in such precipitation as furnished their enemies with a plausible pretence to affirm that they had not considered the treaty with the coolness and deliberation which an affair of this importance required.</P>

On the fifteenth day of February, the debates concerning the union began in the house of lords, the queen being present, and the bishop

of Sarum chairman of the committee. The earls of Rochester, Anglesey, and Nottingham, argued against the union; as did the bishop of Bath and Wells. Lord Haversham, in a premeditated harrangue, said the question was, Whether two nations independent in their sovereignties, that had their distinct laws and interests, their different forms of worship, church-government and order, should be united into one kingdom? He supposed it an union made up of so many mismatched pieces, of such jarring incongruous ingredients, that should it ever take effect, it would carry the necessary consequences of a standing power and force, to keep them from falling asunder and breaking in pieces every moment. He repeated what had been said by lord Bacon, that a unity pieced up by direct admission of contrarieties in the fundamental points of it, is like the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image, which were made of iron and clay: they may cleave together, but would never incorporate. He dissented from the union for the sake of the good old English constitution, in which he dreaded some alteration from the additional weight of sixty-one Scottish members, and these too returned by a Scottish privy-council. He took notice, that above one hundred Scottish peers, and as many commons, were excluded from sitting and voting in parliament, though they had as much right of inheritance to sit there, as any English peer had of sitting in the parliament of Eng∣land. He expressed his apprehension of this precedent; and asked what se∣curity any peer of England had for his right and privilege of peerage, which those lords had not. He said, if the bishops would weaken their own cause, so far as to give up the two great points of episcopal ordination and confirma∣tion; if they would approve and ratify the act for securing the presbyterian church-government in Scotland, as the true protestant religion and purity of worship; they must give up that which had been contended for between them and the presbyterians for thirty years, and been defended by the greatest and most learned men in the church of England. He objected to the exempting articles, by which heritable offices and superiorities were reserved. He affirmed that the union was contrary to the sense of the Scottish nation: that the mur∣murs of the people had been so loud as to fill the whole kingdom; and so bold as to reach even to the doors of the parliament: that the parliament itself had suspended their beloved clause in the act of security for arming the people: that the government had issued a proclamation, pardoning all slaughter, blood∣shed, and maiming, committed upon those who should be found in turnults. From these circumstances he concluded, that the Scottish nation was averse to an incorporating union, which he looked upon as one of the most dangerous experiments to both nations. The lord North and Grey complained of the small and unequal proportion of the land-tax imposed upon Scotland. The earl of Nottingham said it was highly unreasonable that the Scots, who were by the treaty let into all the branches of the English trade, and payed so little towards the expence of the government, should moreover have such a round sum by way of equivalent. The same topics were insisted upon by the lords North and Grey, Guernsey, Granville, Stowell, and Abingdon. The earl of Nottingham, after having opposed every article separately, concluded with words to this effect, <Q>“As Sir John Maynard said to the late king at the revolution, that having buried all his cotemporaries in Westminster-hall, he was afraid, if his majesty had not come in that very juncture of time,
<PB N="331" REF="3340"/>
he might have likewise outlived the very laws; so, if this union do pass, as I have no reason to doubt but it will, I may justly affirm I have out∣lived all the laws, and the very constitution of England: I therefore pray to God to avert the dire effects which may probably ensue from such an in∣corporating union.”</Q></P>

<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>These arguments and objections were answered by the lord-treasurer Godolphin, the earls of Sunderland and Wharton, the lords Townshend, Hal∣lifax, and Somers, the bishops of Oxford, Norwich, and Sarum. They ob∣served, that such an important measure could not be effected without some in∣conveniencies; but that these ought to be borne in consideration of the great∣ness of the advantage: that the chief dangers to which the church was ex∣posed, arose from France and popery; and this union would effectually secure it against these evils: that Scotland lay on the weakest side of England, which could not be defended but by an expensive army. Should a war break out be∣tween the two nations, and Scotland be conquered, yet even in that case it would be necessary to keep it under with a standing army, which any enter∣prising prince might model for his ambitious purposes, and joining with the Scots, enslave his English dominions: that any union after a conquest would be compulsive, consequently of short duration; whereas now it was volun∣tary: that with regard to ecclesiastical affairs, all heats and animosities might be allayed by soft and gentle management. The cantons of Switzerland, though they professed different religions, were yet united in one general body; and the diet of Germany was composed of princes and states, among whom three different persuasions prevailed; so that two sorts of discipline might very well subsist under one legislature. If there was any danger on either side, it threatened the Scots much more than the English, as five hundred and thirteen members would certainly be too hard for forty-five; and in the house of lords, six and twenty bishops would always preponderate against sixteen peers from Scot∣land. Notwithstanding all the opposition made by the lords of the Tory in∣terest, every article was approved by a great majority, though not without a good number of protestations; and a bill of ratification was prepared in the lower house by Sir Simon Harcourt the sollicitor-general, in such an artful manner as to prevent all debates. All the articles, as they passed in Scotland, were re∣cited by way of preamble, together with the acts made in both parliaments,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Boyer. Quincy. Torcy. Tindal. Feuquieres.

Voltaire.</NOTE> for the security of their several churches; and in conclusion there was one clause by which the whole was ratified and enacted into a law. By this con∣trivance, those who were desirous of starting new difficulties, found themselves disabled from pursuing their design. They could not object to the recital, which was barely matter of fact; and they had not strength sufficient to oppose the general enacting clause. On the other hand, the Whigs promoted it with such zeal, that it passed by a majority of one hundred and fourteen, before the others had recollected themselves from the surprize which the structure of the bill had occasioned. It made its way through the house of lords with equal dispatch; and, when it received the royal sanction, the queen expressed the utmost satisfaction. She said she did not doubt but it would be remembered and spoke of hereafter, to the honour of those who had been instrumental in bringing it to such a happy conclusion. She desired that her subjects of both kingdoms should from henceforward behave with all possible respect and kind∣ness
<PB N="332" REF="3350"/>
towards one another, that so it might appear to all the world they had hearts disposed to become one people.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1707.</NOTE> As the act of union did not take place till the first of May, a great number of traders in both kingdoms resolved to make advantage of this inter∣val. The English pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osed to export into Scotland such commodities as in∣titled them to a drawback, with a view to bring them back after the first of May. The Scots, on the other hand, as their duties were much lower than those in England, intended to import great quantities of wine, brandy, and other merchandize, which they could sell at a greater advantage in England after the union, when there would be a free intercourse between the two na∣tions. Some of the ministers had embarked in this fraudulent design, which alarmed the merchants of England to such a degree, that they presented a re∣monstrance to the commons. Resolutions were immediately taken in the house against these practices, and a bill was prepared; but the lords apprehending that it in some measure infringed the articles of the union, and that it might give umbrage to the Scottish nation, it was dropped. The frauds had been in a good measure prevented by the previous resolutions of the house; and the first day of May was now at hand; so that the bill was thought unnecessary. On the twenty-fourth day of April, the queen prorogued the parliament, after having given them to understand, that she would continue by proclamation the lords and commons already assembled, as members in the first British parliament on the part of England, pursuant to the power vested in her by the acts of parliament of both kingdoms, ratifying the treaty of union. The parliament was accordingly revived by proclamation, and another issued to convoke the first parliament of Great Britain for the twenty-third day of Octo∣ber. The Scots repaired to London, where they were well received by the queen, who bestowed the title of duke on the earls of Roxburgh and Mon∣trose. She likewise granted a commission for a new privy-council in that kingdom, to be in force till the next session of parliament, that the nation might not be disgusted by too sudden an alteration of outward appearances. The first of May was appointed as a day of public thanksgiving; and congra∣tulatory addresses were sent up from all parts of England: but, the univer∣sity of Oxford prepared no compliment; and the Scots were wholly silent on this occasion.</P>

<P>In the course of this session the commons, in an address to the queen, desired she would resettle the islands of St. Christopher's and Nevis in the West-Indies, which had been ravaged by the enemy. They likewise resolved, That an humble address should be presented to her majesty, praying, she would con∣cert measures for suppressing a body of pyrates who had made a settlement on the island of Madagascar, as also for recovering and preserving the antient pos∣sessions, trade, and fishery in Newfoundland. The French refugees likewise delivered a remonstrance to the queen, recapitulating the benefits which the per∣secuted protestants in France had reaped from the assistance of her royal proge∣nitors, acknowledging their own happiness in living under her gentle govern∣ment, among a people by whom they had been so kindly entertained when driven from their native country; and imploring her majesty's interposition and good offices in favour of their distressed and persecuted brethren abroad. She graciously received this address, declaring, she had always great compassion for
<PB N="333" REF="3360"/>
the unhappy circumstances of the protestants in France: that she would com∣municate her thoughts on this subject to her allies: and she expressed her hope that such measures might be taken as should effectually answer the intent of their petition. In the month of May she granted an audience to an ambassador extraordinary from the czar of Muscovy, who delivered a letter from his master, containing complaints of king Augustus, who had maltreated the Russian troops sent to his assistance, concluded a dishonourable peace with Charles king of Sweden, without the knowledge of his allies, and surrendered count Patkul the Muscovite minister, as a deserter, to the Swedish monarch, contrary to the law of nations, and even the practice of barbarians. He therefore de∣sired her Britannic majesty would use her good offices for the enlargement of the count, and the other Russian prisoners detained at Stockholm; and, that she would take into her protection the remains of the Russian auxiliaries upon the Rhine, that they might either enter into the service of the allies, or be at liberty to return in safety to their own country. The queen actually interposed in behalf of Patkul; but her intercession proved ineffectual, and that unhappy minister was put to death with all the circumstances of wanton barbarity. As many severe and sarcastic writings had lately appeared, in which the Whigs and mi∣nistry were reviled, and reflections hinted to the prejudice of the queen's person, the government resolved to make examples of the authors and publishers of these licentious productions. Dr. Joseph Browne was twice pilloried for a copy of verses, intituled, "The country parson's advice to the lord-keeper," and a letter which he afterwards wrote to Mr. secretary Harley. William Stephens, rector of Sutton in Surrey, underwent the same sentence, as author of a pamphlet, called, "A letter to the author of the memorial of the church of England." Edward Ward was fined and set in the pillory, for having written a burlesque poem on the times, under the title of "Hudibras redivivus;" and the same pu∣nishment was inflicted upon William Pittes, author of a performance, intituled, "The case of the church of England's memorial fairly stated."</P>

<P>The lower house of convocation still continued to wrangle with their superiors; and though they joined the upper house in a congratulatory address to the queen, on the success of her arms, they resolved to make application to the house of commons against the union. The queen been apprised of their design, desired the archbishop to prorogue them for three weeks, before the ex∣piration of which, the act of union had passed in parliament. The lower house delivered a representation to the bishops, in which they affirmed, no such pro∣rogation had ever been ordered during the session of parliament. The bishops found in their records seven or eight precedents of such prorogations, and above thirty instances of the convocation's having sat sometimes before, and sometimes after a session of parliament, nay, sometimes even when the parliament was dis∣solved. The queen, informed of these proceedings, wrote a letter to the archbishop, intimating, that she looked upon the lower house as guilty of an invasion of her royal supremacy: and, that if any thing of the same nature should be attempted for the future, she would use such means for punishing offenders as the law warranted. The prolocutor absenting himself from the convocation, the archbishop pronounced sentence of contumacy against him. The lower house in a protestation declared this sentence unlawful and altoge∣ther null. Nevertheless, the prolocutor made a full submission, with which the
<PB N="334" REF="3370"/>
archbishop was satisfied; and the sentence was repealed. About this period the earl of Sunderland was appointed one of the secretaries of state, in the room of Sir Charles Hedges. This change was not effected without great op∣position from Harley, who was in his heart an enemy to the duke of Marlbo∣rough and all his adherents; and had already, by his secret intrigues, made con∣siderable progress in a scheme for superseding the influence of the dutchess.</P>

<P>The French king at this juncture seemed to be intirely abandoned by his former good fortune. He had sustained such a number of successive de∣feats as had drained his kingdom of people; and his treasury was almost exhausted. He endeavoured to support the credit of his government by issuing mint-bills, in imitation of the bank-notes of England; but, notwithstanding all his precautions, they passed at a discount of three and fifty per cent. The lands lay uncultivated; the manufactures could be no longer carried on; and the subjects perished with famine. The allies, on the other hand, seemed to prosper in every quarter. They had become masters of the greatest part of the Netherlands, in consequence of the victory at Ramillies: the army of king Charles was considerably reinforced; and a scheme was formed for the conquest of Toulon, by the troops of the emperor and the duke of Savoy, supplied with a large sum of money by queen Anne, and assisted by the combined fleets of England and Holland, under the command of Sir Cloudesley Shovel. In a word, France seemed to be reduced to the verge of destruction, from which no∣thing in all probability could have saved her, but the jealousy and misconduct of the confederates. Lewis, by virtue of his capitulation with the emperor in Italy, was enabled to send such reinforcements into Spain, as turned the fortune of the war in that country; while the distractions in the council of king Charles prevented that unanimity and concurrence, without which no success can be expected. The earl of Peterborough declared against an offensive war, on ac∣count of the difficulty of finding subsistence in Castile; and advised Charles to trust to the expedition against Toulon. This opinion he sent from Italy, to which he had withdrawn.</P>

<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>Charles, however, was persuaded to penetrate once more to Madrid, and give battle to the enemy wherever they should appear. On the thirteenth day of March the army was assembled at Caudela, to the number of sixteen thousand men, under the auspices of the marquis das Minas, to whom the earl of Galway was second in command. They marched towards Yecla, and un∣dertook the siege of Vilena; but, having received intelligence that the duke of Berwick was in the neighbourhood, they advanced on the fourteenth day of April in four columns towards the town of Almanza, where the enemy were drawn up in order of battle, their number being considerably superior to that of the consederates. The battle began about two in the afternoon, and the whole front of each army was fully engaged. The English and Dutch squadrons on the left, sustained by the Portuguese horse of the second line, were overpowered after a gallant resistance. The center, consisting chiefly of battalions from Great-Britain and Holland, obliged the enemy to give way, and drove their first upon their second line; but, the Portuguese cavalry on the right being broken at the first charge, their foot betook themselves to flight; so that the English and Dutch troops being left naked on the flanks, were surrounded and attacked on every side. In this dreadful emergency, they formed themselves
<PB N="335" REF="3380"/>
into a square, and retired from the field of battle. By this time the men were quite spent with fatigue, and all their ammunition ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>austed: they were ignorant of the country, abandoned by their horse, destitute of provision, and cut off from all hope of supply. Moved by these dismal considerations they capitulated, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war, to the amount of thirteen battalions. The Portuguese, and part of the English horse, with the infantry that guarded the baggage, retreated to Alcira, where they were joined by the earl of Galway, with about five and twenty hundred dragoons which he had brought from the field of battle. About three thousand men of the allied army were killed upon the spot, and among that number brigadier Killigrew, and many officers of dis∣tinction. The earl of Galway, who charged in person at the head of Guiscard's dragoons, received two deep cuts in the face. The marquis das Minas was run through the arm, and saw his concubine, who fought in the habit of an Am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣zon, killed by his side: the lords Tyrawley, Mark Ker, and colonel Clayton, were wounded: all their artillery, together with an hundred and twenty colours and standards, and about ten thousand men, were taken; so that no victory could be more complete, though it was not purchased without the loss of two thousand men slain in the action, including some officers of eminence. The duke of Berwick, who commanded the troops of king Philip, acquired a great addition of fame by his conduct and behaviour before, and during the engage∣ment; but his authority was superseded by the duke of Orleans, who arrived in the army immediately after the battle. This prince seemed to entertain some private views of his own; for he took no effectual step to improve the victory. He began a private negotiation with the earl of Galway, during which the two armies lay inactive on the banks of the Cinca; and he concluded the campaign with the siege of Lerida, which was surrendered by capitulation on the second day of November: then the troops on both sides went into winter-quarters. The earl of Galway and the marquis das Minas embarked at Barcelona for Lisbon, and general Carpenter remained commander of the English forces quar∣tered in Catalonia, which was now the only part of Spain that remained to king Charles.</P>

<P>The attempt upon Toulon by the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene might have succeeded, if the emperor, notwithstanding the repeated remon∣strances of the maritime powers, had not divided his army in Italy, by detach∣ing a considerable body through the ecclesiastical state towards Naples, of which he took possession without any difficulty. Besides, ten thousand recruits destined for the Imperial forces in Italy, were detained in Germany, from an appre∣hension of the king of Sweden, who remained in Saxony, and seemed to be upon very indifferent terms with the emperor. With the assistance of the Eng∣lish and Dutch fleets the duke of Savoy and prince Eugene passed the Var on the eleventh day of July, at the head of an army of thirty thousand men, and marched directly towards Toulon, whither the artillery and ammunition were cenveyed on board of the combined squadrons. They took possession of the eminences that commanded the city, and the ordnance being landed, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ected batteries, From these they began to cannonade and bombard the city, while the fleet at∣tacked and reduced two forts at the entrance of the mole; and co-operated in the siege with their great guns and bomb-ketches. The garrison was numerous, and defended the place with great vigour. They sunk ships in the entrance to
<PB N="336" REF="3390"/>
the mole: they kept up a prodigious fire from the ramp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts: they made desperate sallies; and even drove the besiegers from one of their posts with great slaughter. The French king, alarmed at this design of his enemies, ordered troops to march towards Toulon from all parts of his dominions. He countermanded the forc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that were on their route to improve the victory of Almanza: a great part of the army under Villars on the Rhine was detached to Provence, and the court of Versailles declared, that the duke of Burgundy should march at the head of a strong army to the relief of Toulon. The duke of Savoy being apprised of these preparations, seeing no hope of reducing the place, and being apprehen∣sive that his passage would be intercepted, resolved to abandon his enterprize. The artillery being reimbarked, with the sick and wounded, he decamped in the night, and retreated to his own country without molestation. Then he undertook the reduction of Suza, the garrison of which surrendered at discretion. By this conquest he not only secured the key to his own dominions, but also opened to himself a free passage into Dauphiné.</P>

<P>Sir Cloudesley Shovel having left a squadron with Sir Thomas Dilkes for the Mediterranean service, set sail for England with the rest of the fleet, and was in soundings on the twenty-second day of October. About eight o'clock at night his own ship, the Association, struck upon the rocks of Scilly, and perished with every person on board. This was likewise the fate of the Eagle and the Romney: the Firebrand was dashed in pieces on the rocks; but the captain and four and twenty men saved themselves in the boat: the Phoenix was driven on shore: the Royal Anne was saved by the presence of mind and uncommon dexterity of Sir George Byng and his officers: the St. George, com∣manded by the lord Dursley, struck upon the rocks, but a wave set her a-float again. The admiral's body being cast a-shore was stripped and buried in the sand; but afterwards discovered and brought into Plymouth, from whence it was conveyed to London and interred in Westminster-abbey. Sir Cloudesley Shovel was born of mean parentage in the county of Suffolk; but raised him∣self to the chief command at sea by his industry, valour, skill, and integrity. On the Upper Rhine the Allies were unprosperous. The prince of Baden was dead, and the German army so inconsiderable, that it could not defend the lines of Buhl against the marechal de Villars, who broke through this work, esteemed the rampart of Germany, reduced Rastadt, defeated a body of horse, layed the dutchy of Wirtemberg under contribution, took S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gard and Schorndorf; and routed three thousand Germans intrenched at Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch, under the command of general Janus, who was made prisoner. In all probability, this active officer would have made great progress towards the restoration of the elector of Bavaria, had not he been obliged to stop in the middle of his career, in consequence of his army's being diminished by sending off detachments to Provence. The Imperial army retired towards Hailbron, and the command of it was, at the request of the emperor and allies, assumed by the elector of Ha∣nover, who restored military discipline, and acted with uncommon prudence and circumspection; but he had not force sufficient to undertake any enterprize of importance.</P>

<P>In the month of April the duke of Marlborough set out from the Hague for Leipsick with a letter from the queen to Charles XII. of Sweden, whose designs were still so mysterious, that the confederates could not help being
<PB N="337" REF="3400"/>
alarmed at his being in the heart of Germany. The duke was pitched upon as the most proper ambassador, to soothe his vanity and penetrate into his real in∣tention <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the duke arrived in his coach at the quarters of count Piper, of whom he had de∣manded an audience, he was given to understand, that the count was busy, and obliged to wait half an hour before the Swedish minister came down to receive him. When he appeared at last, the duke alighted from his coach, put on his hat, passed the count without saluting him, and went aside to the wall, where having stayed some time, he returned, and accosted him with the most polite address.</NOTE>. He found this original character, not simple, but sordid in his ap∣pearance and oeconomy, savage in his deportment, ferocious, illiterate, stub∣born, implacable, and reserved. The English general assailed him on the side of his vanity, the only part by which he was accessible. <Q>“Sire (said he) I pre∣sent to your majesty a letter, not from the chancery, but from the heart of the queen my mistress, and written with her own hand. Had not her sex prevented her from taking so long a journey, she would have crossed the sea to see a prince admired by the whole universe. I esteem myself happy in having the honour of assuring your majesty of my regard; and I should think it a great happiness, if my affairs would allow me to learn under so great a general as your majesty, what I want to know in the art of war.”</Q> Charles was pleased with this overstrained compliment, which seems to have been calculated for a raw, unintelligent barbarian, unacquainted with the cha∣racters of mankind. He professed particular veneration for queen Anne, as well as for the person of her ambassador, and declared he would take no steps to the prejudice of the grand alliance. Nevertheless, the sincerity of this de∣claration has been questioned. The French court is said to have gained over his minister count Piper to their interest. Certain it is, he industriously sought oc∣casion to quarrel with the emperor, and treated him with great insolence, until he submitted to all his demands. The treaty being concluded upon the terms he thought proper to impose, he had no longer the least shadow of pretence to continue his disputes with the court of Vienna; and therefore began his march for Poland, which was by this time over-run by the czar of Muscovy.</P>

<P>The duke of Marlborough returning from Saxony, assembled the allied army at Anderlach near Brussels, about the middle of May; and, under∣standing that the elector of Bavaria and the duke of Vendome, who commanded the French forces, had quitted their lines, he advanced to Soignies, with a de∣sign to engage them in the plain of Flerus. But receiving certain intelligence, that the enemy were greatly superior to the allies in number, by the help of draughts from all their garrisons, he retreated towards Brussels, and took post at Mildert; while the French advanced to Gemblours. Both armies lay inac∣tive until the enemy sent off a large detachment towards Provence. Then the duke of Marlborough and general Overkirk resolved to attack them in their fortified camp at Gemblours. But, they retreated with such celerity from one post to another, that the confederates could not come up with them until they were safely encamped with their right at Pont a Tresin, and their left under the cannon of Lisle, covered with the river Schelde, and secured by intrenchments. The allies chose their camp at Helchin, and foraged under the cannon of Tour∣nay, within a league of the enemy; but nothing could induce them to hazard an engagement; and both armies went into winter-quarters at the latter end of
<PB N="338" REF="3410"/>
October. The duke of Marlborough set out for Franckfort, where he con∣ferred with the electors of Mentz, Hanover, and Palatine, about the operations of the next campaign: then he returned to the Hague, and having concerted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e necessary measures with the deputies of the states-general, embarked for England in the beginning of November. The queen's private favour was now shitted to a new object. The dutchess of Marlborough was supplanted by Mrs. Masham, her own kinswoman, whom she had rescued from indigence and ob∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urity. This favourite succeeded to that ascendency over the spirit of her so∣vereign, which the dutchess had formerly possessed. She was more humble, pliable, and obliging, than her first patroness, who had played the tyrant, and thwarted the queen in some of her most respected maxims. Her majesty's pre∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion in favour of the Tories and high-churchmen, was no longer inso∣lently condemned, and violently opposed. The new confidante conformed to all her prejudices, and encouraged all her designs with assent and approbation. In political intrigues she acted as associate, or rather auxiliary to Mr. Secretary Harley, who had insinuated himself into the queen's good graces; and deter∣mined to sap the credit of the duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin. His aim was to unite the Tory interest under his own auspices, and expel the Whigs from the advantages they possessed under the government. His chief co∣adjutor in this scheme was Henry St. John, afterwards lord Bolingbroke, a man of warm imagination and elegant taste, penetrating, eloquent, ambitious, and enterprising, whose talents were rather specious than solid, and whose principles were loose and fluctuating. He was at first contented to act in an inferior capa∣city, subservient to the designs of the secretary; but, when he understood the full extent of his own parts and influence, he was fired with the ambition of eclipsing his principal, and from the sphere of his minister, raised himself to the character of his rival. These politicians, with the assistance of Sir Simon Harcourt, a colleague of uncommon ability and credit, exerted their endeavours to rally and reconcile the disunited Tories, who were given to understand, that the queen could no longer bear the tyranny of the Whigs: that she had been always a friend in her heart to the Tory and high-church party: and that she would now exhibit manifest proofs of her inclination. She accordingly be∣stowed the bishopricks of Chester and Exeter upon Sir William Dawes and Dr. Blackall, who, though otherwise of unblemished characters, had openly con∣demned the revolution.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The people in general began to be sick of the Whig ministry, whom they had formerly caressed. To them they imputed the burthens under which they groaned; burthens which they had hitherto been animated to bear by the pomp of triumph and uninterrupted success. At present they were dis∣couraged by the battle of Almanza, the miscarriage of the expedition against Toulon, the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel, and the fate of four ships of the line, destroyed or taken by a squadron under the command of messieurs Forbin and Du Gue Trouin, two of the most enterprising sea-officers in the French service. No new advantage had been obtained in the Netherlands: France, instead of sinking under the weight of the confederacy, seemed to rise with fresh vigour from every overthrow: the English traders had lately sustained repeated losses for want of proper convoys: the coin of the nation was visibly dimi∣nished, and the public credit began to decline. The Tories did not fail to in∣culcate
<PB N="339" REF="3420"/>
and exaggerate these causes of discontent, and the ministry were too remiss in taking proper steps for the satisfaction of the nation. Instead of soothing by gentle measures and equal administration, the Scots, who had expressed such aversion to the union, they treated them in such a manner, as served to exaspe∣rate the spirits of that people. A stop was put to their whole commerce for two months before it was diverted into the new channel. Three months elapsed before the equivalent was remitted to that kingdom, and it was afterwards applied with the most shameful partiality. Seizures of wines and other merchandize im∣ported from thence into England, were made in all the northern parts, with an affectation of severity and disdain: so that the generality of the Scottish na∣tion loudly exclaimed against the union and the government. The Jacobites were again in commotion. They held conferences: they maintained a cor∣respondence with the court of St. Germain's: a great number of the most rigid Whigs entered so far into their measures, as to think a revolution was absolutely necessary to retrieve the liberties, independence, and commerce of their country: the pretender's birth-day was publicly celebrated in many different parts of the kingdom; and every thing seemed to portend an universal revolt. Ireland continued quiet under the administration of the earl of Pem∣broke, whom the queen had appointed lord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieutenant of that kingdom. A parliament having met at Dublin in the month of July, presented addresses of congratulation to her majesty on the late union of the two kingdoms. The commons having inspected the public accounts, resolved, That the kingdom had been put to excessive charge by means of great arrears of rent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>returned by the late trustees, as due out of the forfeited estates, which returns were false and unjust: and, That an humble representation should be layed before her majesty on this subject. They passed another laudable resolution in favour of their own manufactures. They granted the necessary supplies, and having finished several bills for the royal assent, were prorogued on the twenty-ninth day of October.</P>

<P>It was on the twenty-third of the same month that the first parliament of Great Britain assembled at Westminster, when the queen in her speech to both houses palliated the miscarriages in Provence and in Spain; re∣presenting the necessity of making further efforts against the common enemy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and exhorted them to be upon their guard against those who endeavoured to sow jealousies in the commonwealth. The commons in their address expressed the continuance of their former zeal and devotion to her majesty's government<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but, in the house of lords the earl of Wharton expatiated upon the scarcity of money, the decay of trade, the mismanagement of the navy. He was se∣conded by lord Somers and the leaders of the Tory party, who proposed, that previous to every measure, they should consider the state of the nation. The design of Wharton and Somers was to raise the earl of Orford once more to the head of the admiralty; and the Tories, who did not perceive their drift, hoped in the course of the inquiry to fix the blame of all mismanagement upon the Whig ministers. A day being fixed for this examination, the house re∣ceived a petition from the sheriffs and merchants of London, complaining of great losses by sea, for want of cruisers and convoys; and these complaints were proved by witnesses. The report was sent to the lord-admiral, who answered all the articles separately: then the Tories moved for an address, in which the
<PB N="340" REF="3430"/>
blame of the miscarri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges might be layed upon the ministry and cabinet-council; but the motion was over-ruled, and the queen was presented with a bare repre∣sentation of the facts, and desired that she would take the proper measures for pre∣venting such evils for the future. The commons made some progress in an in∣quiry of the same nature; and brought in a bill for the better securing the trade of the kingdom. They chearfully granted the supplies for the service of the en∣suing year. They prepared another bill for repealing the Scottish act of security, and that about peace and war, which had excited such jealousy in the English nation. They resolved, That there should be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great-Britain: That the militia of Scotland should be put on the same footing with that of England: That the powers of the justices of the peace should be the same through the whole island: That the lords of justiciary in Scotland should go circuits twice in the year: That the wr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts for electing Scottish members to serve in the house of commons, should be directed, and returns made in the same manner as practised in England. An act being formed on these resolutions, they brought in a bill for preserving the trade with Portugal: then they considered the state of the war in Spain. When the queen passed these bills, she recommended an augmentation in the aids and auxiliaries granted to the king of Spain and the duke of Savoy.</P>

<P>This intimation produced a debate in the house of lords, on the affairs of Spain. The services of the earl of Peterborough were extolled by the earl of Rochester and lord Haversham, who levelled some oblique reflections at the earl of Galway. Several lords enlarged upon the necessity of carrying on the war until king Charles should be fully established upon the throne of Spain. The earl of Peterborough said, they ought to contribute nine shillings in the pound rather than make peace on any other terms: he declared himself ready to return to Spain, and serve even under the earl of Galway. The earl of Ro∣chester repeated a maxim of the old duke of Schomberg, That attacking France in the Netherlands was like taking a bull by the horns. He therefore proposed, that the allies should stand on the defensive in Flanders, and detach from thence fifteen or twenty thousand men into Catalonia. He was seconded by the earl of No<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tingham, but warmly opposed by the duke of Marlborough, who urged, that the great towns in Brabant which he had conquered, could not be pre∣served without a considerable number of men: and, that if the French should gain any advantage in Flanders from their superiority in point of number, the discontented party in Holland, which was very numerous, and bore with impa∣tience the burthen of the war, would not fail crying aloud for peace. Being challenged by Rochester, to shew how troops could be procured for the service of Italy and Spain, he assured the house, that measures had been already con∣certed with the emperor, for forming an army of forty thousand men under the duke of Savoy, and for sending powerful succours to king Charles. This de∣claration finished the debate, which issued in an affectionate address to her ma∣jesty. The lords resolved, That no peace could be safe and honourable for her majesty and her allies, if Spain and the Spanish West-Indies were suffered to continue in the power of the house of Bourbon. They presented an address, in which they desired she would press the emperor to send powerful succours to Spain, under the command of prince Eugene, with all possible expedition, to make good his contract with the duke of Savoy, and strengthen the army on
<PB N="341" REF="3440"/>
the Rhine, which was now happily p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t under the conduct of that wife and va∣liant prince the elector of Hanover. The commons concurred in this remon∣strance, in consequence of which the queen desired the emperor to bestow the command in Spain upon prince Eugene. The court of Vienna, however, did not comply with this request; but sent thither count Staremberg, who, of all the German generals, was next to the prince in military reputation. The com∣mons now proc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eded to consider of ways and means, and actually established funds for raising the supply, which amounted to the enormous sum of six millions.</P>

<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>At this period Mr. Harley's character incurred suspicion fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the treachery of William Gregg, an inferior clerk in his office, who was detected in a correspondence with monsieur Chamillard the French king's minister. When his practices were detected, he made an ample confession, and pleading guilty to his indictment at the Old-Bailey, was condemned to death for high-treason. At the same time, John Bara and Alexander Valiere were committed to Newgate, for corresponding with the enemy; and Claude Baud, secretary to the duke of Savoy's minister, was, at the request of his master, apprehended for traiterous practices against her majesty and her government. A committee of seven lords being appointed to examine these delinquents, made a report to the house, which was communicated to the queen in an address, importing, that Gregg had discovered secrets of state to the French minister: that Alexander Valiere and John Bara had managed a correspondence with the governors and commissaries of Calais and Boulogne; and, in all probability, discovered to the enemy the stations of the British cruisers, the strength of their convoys, and the times at which the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rchant-ships proceeded on their voyages: that all the papers in the office of Mr. secretary Harley had been for a considerable time exposed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the view of the meanest clerks; and that the perusal of all the let∣ters to and from the French prisoners, had been chiefly trusted to Gregg, a person of a very suspicious character, and known to be extremely indigent. The queen granted a reprieve to this man, in hope of his making some important discovery: but he really knew nothing of consequence to the nation. He was an indigent Scot, who had been employed as a spy in his own country, and now offered his services to Chamillard, with a view of being rewarded for his treachery: but he was discovered before he had reaped any fruits from his cor∣respondence. As he had no secrets of importance to impart, he was ex∣ecuted at Tyburn, where he delivered a paper to the sheriff, in which he de∣clared Mr. Harley intirely ignorant of all his treasonable connections, notwith∣standing some endeavours that were made to engage him in an accusation of that minister.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The queen had refused to admit the earl of Peterborough into her presence, until he should have vindicated his conduct, of which king Charles had complained in divers letters. He was eagerly desirous of a parliamentary inquiry. His military proceedings, his negotiations, his disposal of the re∣mittances, were taken into consideration by both houses: but he produced such a number of witnesses and original papers to justify every transaction, that his character triumphed in the inquiry, which was dropped before it produced any resolution in parliament. Then they took cognizance of the stare of af∣fairs in Spain, and found there had been a great d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ciency in the English troops
<PB N="342" REF="3450"/>
at the battle of Almanza. This, however, was explained so much to their sa∣tisfaction, that they voted an address to the queen, thanking her for having taken measures to restore the affairs in Spain, and provide foreign troops for that service. The bill for rendering the union more complete met with a vigorous opposition in the house of lords, from the court-party, on account of the clause enacting, That, after the first of May, there should be but one privy-council in the kingdom of Great Britain. The ministry finding it was strenuously supported by all the Tories, and a considerable number of the other faction, would have compromised the difference, by proposing that the privy-council of Scotland should continue to the first day of October. They hinted this ex∣pedient in hope of being able to influence the ensuing elections: but their de∣sign being palpable, the motion was over-ruled, and the bill received the royal assent: a court of exchequer, however, was erected in Scotland upon the mo∣del of that in England. The execution of Gregg, and the examination of Valiere and Bara, who had acted as smugglers to the coast of France, under the protection of Harley, to whom they engaged for intelligence, affected the credit of that minister, who was reviled and traduced by the emissaries of the Whig ministers. The duke of Marlborough and the earl of Godolphin being apprised of his secret practices with Mrs. Masham, wrote to the queen that they could serve her no longer, should Mr. Harley continue in the post of se∣cretary. Being summoned to the cabinet-council, they waited on her in per∣son, and expostulated on the same subject. She endeavoured to appease their resentment with soft persuasion, which had no effect; and, when they retired from court, to the astonishment of all the spectators, she repaired in person to the council. There Mr. secretary Harley began to explain the cause of their meeting, which was some circumstance relating to foreign affairs. The duke of Somerset said he did not see how they could deliberate on such matters while the general and treasurer were absent: the other members observed a sullen silence; so that the council broke up, and the queen found herself in danger of being abandoned by her ministers. Next day her majesty sent for the duke of Marlborough, and told him that Harley should immediately resign his of∣fice, which was conferred upon Mr. Henry Boyle, chancellor of the exchequer: but she deeply resented the deportment of the duke and the earl of Godolphin, from whom she intirely withdrew her confidence. Sir Simon Harcourt at∣torney-general, Sir Thomas Mansel comptroller of the houshold, and Mr. St. John, relinquished their several posts upon the disgrace of Harley.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom was at this period alarmed with a threatened in∣vasion from France. The court of St. Germain's had sent over one colonel Hooke with credentials to Scotland, to learn the situation, number, and ability, of the pretender's friends in that country. This minister, by his misconduct, produced a division among the Scottish Jacobites. Being a creature of the duke of Perth, he attached himself wholly to the duke of Athole, and those other zealous partisans who were bent upon receiving the pretender without condi∣tions; and he neglected the duke of Hamilton, the earl Marischal, and other adherents of that house, who adopted the more moderate principles avowed by the earl of Middleton. At his return to France, he made such a favourable report of the disposition and power of the Scottish nation, that Lewis resolved to equip an armament and send over the pretender to that kingdom. His pre∣tence
<PB N="343" REF="3460"/>
was to establish that prince on the throne of his ancestors: but his real aim was to make a division from the Netherlands, and excite a revolt in Great Bri∣tain, which should hinder queen Anne from exerting herself against France on the continent. He began to make preparations for this expedition at Dunkirk, where a squadron was assembled under the command of the chevalier de Fourbin; and a body of land-forces were embarked with monsieur de Gace, afterwards known by the appellation of the marechal de Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignon. The pretender, who had assumed the name of the chevalier de St. George, was furnished with ser∣vices of gold and silver plate, sumptuous tents, rich cloaths for his life∣guards, splendid liveries, and all sorts of necessaries, even to profusion. Lewis, at parting, presented him with a sword studded with valuable diamonds, and repeated what he had formerly said to this adventurer's father: <Q>“He hoped he should never see him again.”</Q> The pope contributed to the expence of this expedition, and accommodated him with divers religious mottos, which were wrought upon his colours and standards. Queen Anne being informed of these preparations, and the design of the French monarch, communicated to the commons the advices which she had received from Holland and the Netherlands, touching the destination of the Dunkirk armament; and both houses concurred in an address, assuring her they would assist her majesty with their lives and fortunes, against the pretended prince of Wales, and all her other enemies. Then they passed a bill, enacting, That the oath of abjura∣tion should be tendered to all persons, and such as refused to take it should be in the condition of convicted recusants. By another, they suspended the Habeas corpus act till October, with relation to persons apprehended by the govern∣ment on suspicion of treasonable practices. The pretender and his adherents were proclaimed traitors and rebels; and a bill was passed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> discharging the clans of Scotland from all vassalage to those chiefs who should take up arms against her majesty. Transports were hired to bring over ten British battalions from Ostend; and a large fleet being equipped with incredible diligence, sailed from Deal towards Dunkirk, under the conduct of Sir John Leake, Sir George Byng, and lord Dursley. The French imagined that Leake had sailed to Lis∣bon, and that Britain was unprovided of ships of war; so that they were amazed and confounded when this fleet appeared off Mardyke: a stop was immediately put to the embarkation of their troops: frequent expresses were dispatched to Paris: the count de Fourbin represented to the French king the little probability of succeeding in this enterprize, and the danger that would attend the attempt: but he received positive orders to embark the forces, and set sail with the first favourable wind.</P>

<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">

<P>The British fleet being forced from their station by severe weather on the fourteenth day of March, the French squadron sailed on the seven∣teenth from the road of Dunkirk; but the wind shifting, it anchored in New∣port-pits, till the nineteenth in the evening, when they set sail again with a fair breeze, steering their course for Scotland. Sir George Byng having re∣ceived advice of their departure, from an Ostend vessel sent out for that pur∣pose by major-general Cadogan, gave chace to the enemy, after having de∣tached a squadron under admiral Baker to convoy the troops that were em∣barked at Ostend for England. On the tenth day of March, the queen went to the house of peers, where, in a speech to both houses, she told them that
<PB N="344" REF="3470"/>
the French fleet had sailed; that Sir George Byng was in pursuit of them; and that ten battalions of her troops were expected every day in England. This intimation was followed by two very warm addresses from the lords and commons, in which they repeated their assurances of standing by her against all her enemies; exhorted her to persevere in supporting the common cause<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwith∣sta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding this petty attempt to disturb her dominions; and leve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed some severe in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuations aga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst those who endeavoured to foment jealeusies between her majesty and her most faithful servants. Addresses on the same occasion were sent up from different parts of the kingdom; so that the queen seemed to look with contempt upon the designs of the enemy. Several regiments of foot, with some squadrons of cavalry<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> began their march for Scotland; while the earl of Leven, commander in chief of the forces in that country, and gover∣nor of the castle of Edinburgh, hastened thither to put that fortress in a pos∣ture of defence, and to make the proper dispositions to oppose the pretender at his landing. But the vigilance of Sir George Byng rendered all these precau∣tions unnecessary. He sailed directly to the frith of Edinburgh, where he arrived almost as soon as the enemy, who immediately took the advantage of a land breeze, and bore away with all the sail they could carry. The Eng∣lish admiral gave chace; and the Salisbury, one of their ships, was boarded and taken. At night monsieur de Fourbin altered his course; so that next day they were out of reach of the English squadron. The pretender desired they would proceed to the northward, and land him at Inverness, and Four∣bin seemed willing to gratify his request; but the wind changing, and blow∣ing in their teeth with great violence, he represented the danger of attempting to prosecute the voyage; and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with the consent of the chevalier de St. George and his general, returned to Dunkirk, after having been tossed about a whole month in very tempestuous weather. In the mean time, Sir George Byng sailed up to Leith road, where he received the freedom of the city of Edin∣burgh in a golden box, as a testimony of gratitude for his having delivered them from the dreadful apprehensions under which they laboured.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P>Certain it is, the pretender could not have chosen a more fa∣vourable opportunity for making a descent upon Scotland. The people in ge∣neral were disaffected to the government on account of the union: the regular troops under Leven did not exceed five and twenty hundred men, and even great part of these would in all probability have joined the invader: the castle of Edinburgh was destitute of ammunition, and would in all appearance have surrendered at the first summons; in which case the Jacobites must have been masters of the equivalent money lodged in that fortress: a good number of Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch ships loaded with cannon, small arms, ammunition, and a large sum of money, had been driven on shore in the shire of Angus, where they would have been seized by the friends of the pretender, had the French troops been landed; and all the adherents of that house were ready to appear in arms. In England, such a demand was made upon the bank, by those who favoured the invasion, and those who dreaded a revolution, that the public credit seemed to be in danger. The commons resolved, That whoever designedly endeavoured to destroy or lessen the public credit, especially at a time when the kingdom was threatened with an invasion, was guilty of a high crime and misde∣meanour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and an enemy to her majesty and the kingdom. The lord-treasurer

signified to the directors of the bank, that her majesty would allow, for six<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet. Hare. Boyer. Lockhart. Feuquieres. Daniel. Hist. of the D. of Marlbo∣rough.

The French, Dutch, and Jewish menchants, whose interest was in a pe∣culiar manner connected with the safety of the bank, exerted themselves for its support; and the directors having called in twenty per cent. upon their capital stock, were enabled to answer all the demands of the timorous and disaffected. All the nobleman and persons of distinction in Scotland, suspected of an at∣tachment to the court of St. Germain's, were apprehended, and either im∣prisoned in the castle of Edinburgh, or brought up to London, to be confined in the Tower or in Newgate. Among these was the duke of Hamilton, who found means to make his peace with the Whig ministers; and, in a little time, the other prisoners were admitted to bail <NOTE PLACE="marg">Three Camisars, or protestants from the Cevennois, having made their escape, and re∣paired to London, acquired about this time the appellation of French prophets, from their en∣thusiastic gesticulations, effusions, and convul∣sions, and even formed a sect of their country∣men. The French refugees, scandalized at their behaviour, and authorized by the bishop of Lon∣don, as superior of the French congregations, resolved to inquire into the mission of these pre∣tended prophets, whose names were Elias Ma∣rion, John Cavallier, and Durand Fage. They were declared impostors and counterfeits. Not∣withstanding this decision, which was confirmed by the bishops, they continued their assemblies in Soho, under the countenance of Sir Richard Bulkley and John Lacy. They reviled the ministers of the established church; they denounced judg∣ments against the city of London, and the whole British nation; and published their predictions, composed of unintelligible jargon. Then they were prosecuted at the expence of the French churches, as disturbers of the public peace, and false prophets. They were sentenced to pay a fine of twenty marks each, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wice on a scaffold, with papers on their br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sts d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oting their offence: a sentence which was executed accordingly at Charing-cross and the Royal Ex∣change.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>On the first day of April, the parliament was prorogued, and afterwards dissolved by proclamation. Writs were issued out for new<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

After the dissolution of the parliament, the lords Griffin, Clermont, two sons of the earl of Middleton, and several Scottish and Irish officers, who had been taken on board of the Salisbury, were brought to London, and imprisoned in the Tower or in Newgate. Lord Griffin being attained by outlawry, for high-treason committed in the reign of king William, was brought to the bar in the court of king's-bench, and a rule made for his execution: but he was re∣prieved from month to month, until he died of a natural death in prison. The privy-council of Scotland was dissolved, the duke of Queensberry created a British peer, by the title of baron of Rippon, marquis of Beverley, and duke of Dover; and the office of secretary at war, vacant by the resignation of Henry St. John, was bestowed upon Robert Walpole, a gentleman who had rendered himself considerable in the house of commons, and whose conduct we shall have occasion to mention more at large in the sequel. About the same time a proclamation was issued for distributing prizes in certain proportions,

<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The French king, not at all discouraged by the miscarriage of his projected invasion, resolved to improve the advantages he had gained on the continent during the last campaign; and indeed he made efforts that were alto∣gether incredible, considering the consumptive state of his finances. He assembled a prodigious army in the Netherlands, under the command of the duke of Burgundy, assisted by Vendome, and accompanied by the duke of Berry and the chevalier de St. George. The elector of Bavaria was destined to the command of the troops upon the Rhine, where he was seconded by the duke of Berwick; and the marechal de Villeroy was sent to conduct the forces in Dauphiné. About the latter end of March, the duke of Marlborough repaired to the Hague, where he was met by prince Eugene, and these two celebrated generals conferred with the pen∣sionary Heinsius, and the deputies of the states-general. Then they made an excursion to Hanover, where they prevailed upon the elector to be satisfied with acting upon the defensive in his command on the Rhine, and spare part of his forces, that the confederates might be enabled to make vigorous efforts in the Netherlands. The prince proceeded to Vienna, and the duke returned to Flanders, where he assembled the army towards the latter end of May. On the twenty-fifth day of that month, the duke of Vendome marched to Soignies, and posted himself within three leagues of the confederates, who were encamped at Billinghen and Halle. The duke of Marlborough having received intelli∣gence that the enemy were on their march by Bois-Seigneur-Isaac to Braine-la-Leu, concluded their intention was to take post on the banks of the Deule, to hinder the allies from passing that river, and to occupy Louvaine. He there∣fore commanded the army to march all night, and on the third day of June encamped at Terbank, general Overkirk fixing his quarters in the suburbs of Louvaine, while the French advanced no farther than Genap and Braine-la-Leu. As they were more numerous than the confederates, and headed by a prince of the blood, the general of the allies at first expected that they would hazard a battle: but their scheme was to retrieve by stratagem the places they had lost in Flanders. The elector of Bavaria had rendered himself extremely popular in the great towns: the count de Bergeyck, who had great interest among them, was devoted to the house of Bourbon: the inhabitants of the great cities were naturally inconstant and mutinous, and particularly dissatis∣fied with the Dutch government. The French generals resolved to profit by these circumstances. A detachment of their troops, under the brigadiers la Faille and Pasteur, surprised the city of Ghent, in which there was no garrison; and, at the same time, the count de la Motte, with a strong body of forces, ap∣peared before Bruges, which was surrendered to him without opposition: then he made a fruitless attempt upon Damme, and marched to the little fort of Plassendahl, which he took by assault. The duke of Marlborough was no sooner apprised of the enemy's having sent a strong detachment towards Tu∣bize, than he marched from Terbank, passed the canal, and encamped at An∣derlech. The French crossed the Senne at Halle and Tubize, and the allies resolved to attack them next morning; but they passed the Dender in the night with great expedition; and the duke of Marlborough next day en∣camped at Asche, where he was joined by prince Eugene, who had marched
<PB N="347" REF="3500"/>
with a considerable reinforcement of Germans from the Moselle. The enemy understanding that this general was on his march, determined to reduce Oude∣narde, the only pass on the Schelde possessed by the allies; and invested it on the ninth day of July, hoping to subdue it before the allies could be reinforced. The duke of Marlborough was immediately in motion, and made a surprising march from Asche, as far as Herfelingen, where he was joined by the reinforce∣ment. Then he took possession of the strong camp at Lessines, which the French had intended to occupy in order to cover the siege of Oudenarde.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="35" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>Thus disappointed, the French generals altered their resolution, aban∣doned Oudenarde, and began to pass the Schelde at Gavre. The two generals of the confederates were bent upon bringing them to an engagement. Cadogan was sent with sixteen battalions and eight squadrons to repair the roads, and throw bridges over the Schelde below Oudenarde. The army was in motion at eight o'clock, and marched with such expedition, that by two in the afternoon the horse had reached the bridges over which Cadogan and his detachment were passing. The enemy had posted seven battalions in the village of Heynem, situated on the banks of the Schelde, and the French houshold-troops were drawn up in order of battle on the adjacent plain, opposite to a body of troops under major-general Rantzaw, who were posted behind a rivulet that ran into the river. The duke of Vendome intended to attack the confederates when one half of their army should have passed the Schelde; but he was thwarted by the duke of Burgundy, who seemed to be perplexed and irreso∣lute. He had ordered the troops to halt in their march to Gavre, as if he had not yet formed any resolution; and now he recalled the squadrons from the plain, determined to avoid a battle. Vendome remonstrated against this con∣duct, and the dispute continued till three in the afternoon, when the greater part of the allied army had passed the Schelde without opposition. Then the duke of Burgundy declared for an engagement, and Vendome submitted to his opinion with great reluctance, as the opportunity was now lost and the army unformed. Major-general Grimaldi was ordered to attack Rantzaw with the horse of the king's houshold, who finding the rivulet marshy, refused to charge, and retired to the right. Mean while Cadogan attacked the village of Hey∣nem, which he took, with three of the seven battalions by which it was guarded. Rantzaw pas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing the rivulet, advanced into the plain, and drove before them several squadrons of the enemy. In this attack, the electoral prince of Hanover, his present majesty, charged at the head of Bulau's dragoons with great in∣trepidity. His horse was shot under him, and colonel Luschky killed by his side. Divers French regiments were intirely broken, and a good number of officers and standards fell into the hands of the Hanoverians. The confederates continued still passing the river; but few or none of the infantry were come up till five in the afternoon, when the duke of Argyle arrived with twenty bat∣talions, which immediately sustained a vigorous assault from the enemy. By this time the French were drawn up in order of battle; and the allies being formed as they passed the river, both armies were engaged through the whole extent of their lines about seven in the evening. Europe had not for many years produced two such noble armies: above one hundred general officers ap∣peared in the field, and two hundred and fifty colonels fought at the head of their respective regiments. The number of the French exceeded that of the
<PB N="348" REF="3510"/>
allies by twelve thousand: but their generals were divided; their forces ill disposed, and their men disp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rited by the uninterrupted success of their adver∣saries. They seemed from the beginning averse to an engagement, and acted in hurry and trepidation. Nevertheless, the action was maintained until ge∣neral Overkirk and count Tilly, who commanded on the left of the allies, obliged the right of the enemy to give ground; and the prince of Orange with count Oxienstern attacked them in flank with the Dutch infantry. Then they began to give way, and retired in great confusion. The duke of Vendome alighting from his horse, rallied the broken battalions, called the officers by name, con∣jured them to maintain the honour of their country, and animated the men with his voice and example. But, notwithstanding all his endeavours, they were forced back among the inclosures in great confusion. Some regiments were cut in pieces: others desired to capitulate; and, if the darkness had not interposed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their whole army would have been ruined. The night coming on, so that it became impossible to distinguish friends from enemies, the two ge∣nerals ordered the troops to cease firing, and the enemy took this opportunity of escaping, by the road which leads from Oudenarde to Ghent. The duke of Vendome seeing the French forces flying in the utmost terror and precipita∣tion, formed a rear-guard of about five and twenty squadrons and as many battalions, with which he secured the retreat. To this precaution the safety of their army was entirely owing; for at day-break the duke of Marlborough sent a large detachment of horse and foot under the lieutenant-generals Bulau and Lumley, to pursue the fugitives; but the hedges and ditches that skirted the road were lined with the French grenadiers in such a manner, that the cavalry could not form, and they were obliged to desist. The French reached Ghent about eight in the morning, and marching through the city, encamped at Lovendegen on the canal. There they thought proper to cast up intrench∣ments, upon which they planted their artillery which they had left at Gavre with their heavy baggage. About three thousand were slain on the field of battle: two thousand deserted, and about seven thousand were taken, includ∣ing a great number of officers, together with ten pieces of cannon, above an hundred standards and colours, and four thousand horses. The loss of the allies did not amount to two thousand men; nor was one officer of distinction killed on their side during the whole engagement. After the confederates had rested two days on the field of battle, a detachment was ordered to level the French lines between Ypres and the Lys: another was sent to raise contributions as far as Arras, and struck terror even into the city of Paris. While the allies plundered the province of Picardy, a detachment from the French army, under the chevalier de Rozen, made an irruption into Dutch-Flanders; broke through the lines of Bervliet, which had been left unguarded, and made a descent upon the island of Casandt, which they laid under contribution.</P>

<P>The generals of the allies now undertook an enterprize which, in the opinion of the French generals, favoured of rashness and inconsiderate self-sufficiency. This was the siege of Lisle, the strongest town in Flanders, provided with all necessaries, store of ammunition, and a garrison reinforced by one and twenty battalions of the best troops in France, commanded by marechal de Boufflers in person. But these were not the principal difficulties which the allies encountered. The enemy had cut off the communication be∣tween
<PB N="349" REF="3520"/>
them and their magazines at Antwerp and Sas-Van-Ghent; so that they were obliged to bring their convoys from Ostend along a narrow causeway, ex∣posed to the attack of an army more numerous than that with which they sat down before Lisle. On the thirteenth of August, it was invested on one side by prince Eugene, and on the other by the prince of Orange-Nassau, stadt∣holder of Friesland; while the duke of Marlborough encamped at Helchin, to cover the siege. The trenches were opened on the twenty-second day of Au∣gust, and carried on with that vigour and alacrity which is always inspired by victory and success. The dukes of Burgundy and Vendome being now joined by the duke of Berwick, resolved, if possible, to relieve the place; and made se∣veral marches and counter-marches for this purpose. Marlborough being ap∣prised of their intention, marched out of his lines to give them battle, being re∣inforced by a considerable body of troops from the siege, including Augustus king of Poland, and the landgrave of Hesse as volunteers: but the enemy declined an engagement, and the allies returned to their camp, which they for∣tified with an intrenchment. On the seventh day of September, the besiegers took by assault the counterscarp of Lisle, after an obstinate action, in which they lost a thousand men. The French generals continued to hover about the camp of the confederates, which they actually cannonaded; and the duke of Marlborough again formed his army in order of battle: but their design was only to harrass the allies with continual alarms, and interrupt the operations of the siege. They endeavoured to surprise the town of Aeth, by means of a secret correspondence with the inhabitants; but the conspiracy was discovered before it took effect Then they cut off all communication between the besiegers and the Schelde, the banks of which they fortified with strong in∣trenchments, and a prodigious number of cannon; so that now all the stores and necessaries were sent to the camp of the confederates from Ostend. On the twenty-first day of September prince Eugene, who was in the trenches, seeing the troops driven by the enemy from a lodgment they had made on the counterscarp of the Tenaille, rallied and led them back to the charge; but being wounded over the left eye with a musket-shot, he was obliged to retire, and for some days the duke of Marlborough sustained the whole command, both in the siege and of the covering army. On the twenty third, the Tenaille was stormed, and a lodgment made along the covered-way. Marechal Boufflers having found means to inform the duke of Vendome that his ammunition was almost expended, this general detached the chevalier de Luxemburg with a body of horse and dragoons to supply the place with gun-powder, every man carrying a bag of forty pounds upon the crupper. They were discovered in passing through the camp of the allies, and pursued to the barrier of the town, into which about three hundred were admitted; but a great number were killed by the confederates, or miserably destroyed by the explosion of the powder which they carried.</P>

<P>The next attempt of the French generals was to intercept a convoy from Ostend. The count de la Motte marched from Ghent with about two and twenty thousand men to attack this convoy, which was guarded by six thousand of the allies, commanded by major-general Webb, who made such an admirable disposition by the wood of Wynendale, and received the enemy with such a close fire, that, after a very warm action that lasted two hours,
<PB N="$50" REF="3530"/>
they retired in the utmost confusion, notwithstanding their great superiority in n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mber, leaving six thousand men killed upon the field of battle; the loss of the allies not exceeding nine hundred and twelve officers and soldiers. This was the most honourable exploit performed during the whole war, and of such consequence to the confederates, that if the convoy had been taken, the siege must have been raised. The duke of Vendome ordered the dykes between Bruges and Newport to be cut, so as to lay the whole country under water, in hope of destroying the communication between Ostend and the camp of the confederates; and, after a regular siege, he took colonel Caulfield and a body of British troops posted in the village of Leffinghen, by whose means the convoys had been forwarded to the duke of Marlborough. On the twenty-second of October, marechal Boufflers desired to capitulate for the town of Lisle: next day the articles were signed: on the twenty-fifth the allies took posse<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sion of the place, and the marechal retired into the citadel with the re∣mains of his garrison, which, from twelve thousand, was reduced to less than the half of that number. A negotiation was begun for the surrender of the ci<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adel: but Boufflers made such extravagant demands as were rejected with disdain. Hostilities were renewed on the twenty-ninth day of the month; and the earl of Stair was detached to provide corn for the army in the districts of Furnes and Dixmuyde. During these transactions, velt-marechal Overkirk died at Rousselaer, in the sixty-s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venth year of his ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, after having, in above thirty campaigns, exhibited innumerable proofs of uncommon courage, ability, and moderation. The duke of Vendome did not yet despai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of obliging the confederates to abandon their enterprize: the French ministers at Rome and Venice publicly declared the allied army was cooped up in such a manner, that it must either raise the siege or be famished. The elector of Bavaria, with a detachment of ten thousand men, marched to Brussels and attacked the counterscarp with incredible fury; but was repulsed by the garrison under the command of general Paschal, and retired with precipitation, when he under∣stood that the duke of Marlborough was in motion to relieve the place. This nobleman and prince Eugene no sooner understood the danger to which Brus∣sels was exposed, than they marched with the covering<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>army to the Schelde, which they pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed on pontoons without opposition, notwithstanding the formi∣dable works which the French had raised. They now abandoned them with precipitation, to the surprize of the confederates, who had laid their account with the loss of a thousand men in the attack. Having passed the river between Eskena<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e and Hauterive, as well as at other places, they marched to Oude∣narde, where they received intelligence that the elector had retreated. Then prince Eugene returned to Lisle, and the duke of Marlborough proceeded to Brussels, where he was received with joy and acclamation. He afterwards took post at Oudenarde, so as to maintain a communication with prince Eugene.</P>

<P>The besiegers having made lodgments and raised batteries on the second counterscarp of the citadel, sent a message to Bou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ers, intimating, that if he would surrender before the opening of the batteries, he should have an honourable capitulation; otherwise he and his garrison must be made pri∣soners of war. He chose to avoid the last part of the alternative: hostages were exchanged on the eighth day of December, and the articles signed on the tenth; when the marechal and his garrison marched out with the honours of
<PB N="351" REF="3540"/>
war, and were conducted to Doway. In this great enterprize, spirit and perse∣verance made amends for want of foresight and skill, which was flagrant on the side of the confederates; though their success was owing in a great mea∣sure to the improvidence and misconduct of the besieged. The French generals never dreamed that the allies would attempt any thing of consequence after the reduction of Lisle, considering the advanced season of the year, and therefore they returned to Paris, after having distributed their army into winter-quarters. But their indefatigable antagonists were determined to strike another stroke of importance before their forces should separate. On the twentieth day of De∣cember they invested the city of Ghent on all sides; and on the thirtieth, when the batteries were ready to open, the count de la Motte, who commanded the garrison, desired to capitulate. On the third day of the next month he marched out with thirty battalions and sixteen squadrons, which were conducted <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Tournay; while the duke of Argyle, with six British battalions, took posses∣ssion of the town and citadel. Then the enemy abandoned Bruges, Plassen∣dahl, and Leffengen; and the generals of the allies having settled the plan of winter-quarters, repaired to Holland, leaving the forces under the command of count Tilly. The French king was confounded and dismayed at these co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quests in the Netherlands. Nor was he easy on the side of Dauphiné, where, in spite of all the vigilance and activity of Villars, the duke of Savoy made himself master of the important fortresses of Exilles, La Perouse, the valley of St. Martin, and Fenestrelles; so that by the end of the campaign he had secured a barrier to his own frontiers, and opened a way into the French provinces, after having made a diversion in favour of king Charles, by oblig∣ing the enemy to send a strong detatachment from Rousillon to the assistance of Villars.</P>

<P>The campaign in Catalonia was productive of a great event. Count Guido de Staremberg arrived at Barcelona on the last day of April; but the Impe∣rial troops brought from Italy by admiral Leake, did not land in time to relieve Tortosa, which the duke of Orleans besieged and took, together with Denia, the garrison of which were made prisoners of war, contrary to the articles of capitulation. These losses, however, were abundantly made up to the allies by the conquest of Sardinia and Minorca. Sir John Leake, having taken on board a handful of troops, under the conduct of the marquis D'Alconzel, set sail for Cagliari, and summoned the viceroy to submit to king Charles. As he did not send an immediate answer, the admiral began to bombard the city, and the inhabitants compelled him to surrender at discretion. The greater part of the garrison enlisted themselves in the service of Charles. The deputies of the states being assembled by the marquis D'Alconzel, acknowledged that prince as their sovereign, and agreed to furnish his army with thirty thousand sacks of corn, which were accordingly transported to Catalonia, where there was a great scarcity of provision. Major-general Stanhope having planned the conquest of Minorca, and concerted with the admiral the measures necessary to put it in excu∣tion, obtained from count Staremberg a few battalions of Spaniards, Italians, and Portuguese, embarked at Barcelona with a fine train of British artillery, accompanied by brigadier Wade and colonel Petit, an engineer of great repu∣tation. They landed on the island about two miles from St. Philip's fort, on the twenty-sixth of August, with about eight hundred marines, which aug∣mented
<PB N="352" REF="3550"/>
their number to about three thousand. Next d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rected batte∣ries; and general Stanhope ordered a number of arrows to be shot into the place, to which papers were affixed, written in the Spanish and French languages, containing threats, that all the garrison should be sent to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if they would not surren<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er before the batteries were finished. The garrison consisted of a thousand Spaniards and six hundred French marines, commanded by colonel la Jonquiere, who imagined that the number of the besiegers amounted to at least ten thousand; so artfully had they been drawn up in sight of the enemy. The batteries began to play, and in a little time demolished <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our towers that served as outworks to the fort: then they made a breach in the outward wall, through which brigadier Wade, at the head of the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adiers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ormed a redoubt, with such extraordinary valour as struck the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esieged with con∣ster<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tion. On the second or third day they thought proper to beat a parley, and capitulate, on condition, That they should march out with the honours of war: That the Spaniards should be transported to M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cia and the French to Tou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on. These last, however, were detained by way of rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isal for the gar∣rison of Denia. The Spanish governor was so mortified when he learned the real number of the besiegers, that on his arrival at Murcia he threw himself out of a window in despair, and was killed upon the spot. La Jonquiere was con∣fined for life, and all the French officers incurred their master's displeasure. Fort St. Philip being thus reduced, to the amazement of all Europe, and the garrison of Port Fornelles having surrendered themselves prisoners to the admi∣rals Leake and Whitaker, the inhabitants gladly submitted to the English go∣vernment, for king Philip had oppressed and deprived them of their privil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ges; and general Stanhope appointed colonel Petit governor of Fort St. Philip, and deputy-governor of the whole island. After this important conquest he re∣turned to the army in Spain, where an unsuccessful attempt to surprise Tortosa finished the operations of the campaign.</P>

This ponti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> had manifested his partiality to the house of Bourbon in such a palpable manner, that his Imperial majesty ordered monfieur de Bonneval to march with the troops that were in Italy, rein∣forced by those belonging to the duke of Modena, and invade the du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chy of Ferrara.

The
<PB N="353" REF="3560"/>
marquis de Prie, a Piedmontese nobleman, was sent as ambassador to Rome; but, the pope would not receive him in that quality. Elated with the promises of France, he set the emperor at defiance; and his troops having sur∣prised a body of Imperialists, were so barbarous as to cut them all in pieces. The duke of Savoy having ended the campaign, the troops of the emperor which had served under that prince, were ordered to march into the papal territories, and drove the forces of his holiness before them, without any regard to number. Bologna capitulated; and Rome began to tremble with the apprehension of being once more sacked by a German army. Then the pope's courage failed: he was glad to admit the marquis de Prie as envoy from the emperor. He consented to disband his new levies; to accommodate the Imperial troops with winter-quarters in the papal territories; to grant the investiture of Naples to king Charles; and allow at all times a passage to the Imperial troops through his dominions. On the Upper Rhine the electors of Bavaria and Hanover were so weak, that they could not undertake any thing of consequence against each other. In Hungary the disputes still continued between the emperor and the malcontents. Poland was at length delivered from the oppression exercised by the king of Sweden, who marched into the Ukraine against the czar of Mus∣covy, notwithstanding the submissions with which that monarch endeavoured to appease his indignation. During the course of this year the English mer∣chants sustained no considerable losses by sea: the cruisers were judiciously sta∣tioned, and the trade was regularly supplied with convoys. In the West-Indies commodore Wager destroyed the admiral of the galleons, and took the rear-admiral on the coast of Carthagene. Had the officers of his squadron done their duty, the greatest part of the fleet would have fallen into his hands. At his return to Jamaica two of his captains were tried by a court-martial, and dismissed from the service.</P>

<P>The court of England was about this time not a little disquieted, by the consequences of an outrage committed on the person of the count de Ma∣tueof the Muscovite ambassador. He was publicly arrested at the suit of a laceman, and maltreated by the bailiffs, who dragged him to prison, where he continued until he was bailed by the earl of Feversham. Incensed at this in∣sult, he demanded redress of the government, and was seconded in his remon∣strances by the ministers of the emperor, the king of Prussia, and several other foreign potentates. The queen expressed uncommon indignation against the authors of this violence, who were immediately apprehended, and orders were given to prosecute them with the utmost severity of the law. Matueof repeated his complaints with great acrimony; and Mr. secretary Boyle assured him, in the queen's name, that he should have ample satisfaction. Notwith∣standing this assurance, he demanded a pass for himself and his family, refused the ordinary presents at his departure, and retired to Holland. From thence he transmitted a memorial with a letter from the czar to the queen, insisting upon her punishing with death all the persons concerned in violating the law of nations upon the person of his ambassador. Such punishment being altogether inconsistent with the laws of England, the queen and her ministry were extremely perplexed, and held several councils to deliberate upon the measures proper to be taken on such an occasion. On the twenty-eighth day of October prince George of Denmark died of an asthma and dropsy, with which he had been
<PB N="354" REF="3570"/>
long afflicted. He was a prince of an amiable rather than a shining character, brave, good-natured, modest, and humane, but devoid of great talents and am∣bition. He had always lived in harmony with the queen, who, during the whole term of their union, and especially in his last illness, approved herself a pattern of conjugal truth and tenderness. At his death the earl of Pembroke was created lord high-admiral, the earl of Wharton promoted to the govern∣ment of Ireland, and lord Somers appointed president of the council. Not∣withstanding these promotions of the Whig noblemen, the duke of Marlbo∣rough declined <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ace in his credit with the queen, who privately consulted and reposed her chief confidence in Mr. Harley, though he had no visible concern in the administration.</P>

<P>The new parliament, in which the Whig interest still preponderated, was assembled on the sixteenth day of November, when they were given to un∣derstand by a commission under the great seal, that the archbishop of Canter∣bury, the chancellor, the lord-treasurer, the lord-steward, and the master of the horse, were appointed to represent the person of her majesty, whom decency would not permit to appear in the house so soon after the death of her consort. Sir Richard Onflow being chosen speaker of the lower house with the queen's ap∣probation, the chancellor, in a speech to both houses<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recommended the vigo∣rous prosecution of the war, telling them her majesty hoped, they would enable her to make a considerable augmentation for preserving and improving the ad∣vantages which the allies had gained in the Netherlands: that she desired they would prepare such bills as might confirm and render the union effectual: and, that if they would propose means for the advancement of trade and manufac∣ture, she would take pleasure in enacting such provisions. Both houses having presented addresses of condolence and congratulation, on the death of prince George, and the success of her majesty's arms during the last cam∣paign, the commons took cognizance of controverted elections, which were decided with shameful partiality for the Whig faction. Then they proceeded to consider the different branches of the supply: they approved of an augmen∣tation of ten thousand men, which was judged necessary for the more vigorous prosecution of the war<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, they voted above seven m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llions for the service of the ensuring year.

<P>Great debates having arisen about Scotti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h elections, the house considered the petitions and representations that were delivered, touching the in∣capacity of the eldest sons of Scottish peers, excluded from sitting in the parlia∣ment of Great-Britain. Counsel being heard upon the subject, that incapacity was confirmed; and new writs were issued, that new members might be elected for the shires of Aberdeen and Linlithgow, in the room of William lord Haddo, and James lord Johnstown. Petitions were likewise presented to the house of lords by some Scottish peers, concerning their right of voting, and signing proxies. After warm debates, the house upon a division determined, that a Scottish lord created a peer of Great-Britain, should no longer retain his vote
<PB N="355" REF="3580"/>
in Scotland: and, that the noblemen who were in the castle of Edinburgh had a right to sign proxies, after having taken the oaths to the government. The Scottish peers and commoners that sat in the British parliament, were divided into two factions. The duke of Queensberry was in great credit with the queen and the lord-treasurer, by whose interest he was appointed secretary of state for Scotland. His influence in elections was so great, that all offices in that kingdom were bestowed according to his recommendation. He was op∣posed by the dukes of Hamilton, Montrose, and Roxburgh, who were supported by the earl of Sunderland and lord Somers; so that the whole interest in that country was engrossed by one or other member of the ministry. A bill for a general naturalization of all protestants was brought into the house, and not∣withstanding violent opposition from the Tories both among the lords and com∣mons, was enacted into a law. The Whigs argued for this bill, as a measure that would encourage industry, improve trade and manufacture, and repa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the wafte of men which the war had occasioned; but one of their chief motives was to throw an addition of foreigners into the balance against the landed in∣terest. The Tories pleaded, that a conflux of aliens might prove dangerous to the constitution: that they would retain a fondness for their native countries, and in times of war act as spies and enemies: that they would insinuate them∣selves into places of trust and profit; become members of parliament, and by frequent intermarriages contribute to the extinction of the English race: that they would add to the number of the poor, already so expensive; and share the bread of the labourers and tradesmen of England.</P>

<P>An inquiry being set on foot in both houses concerning the late intended invasion of Scotland, lord Haversham and the other Tory members endeavoured to demonstrate, that proper precautions had not been taken for the security of that kingdom, even after the ministry had received undoubted in∣telligence of the pretender's design; and, that since the attempt had miscarried, many persons of quality had been apprehended, and severely used by the go∣vernment, on pretended suspicion of high-treason; though, in all probability, the aim of the ministry in confining those persons, was to remove all possibility of their opposing the court at the ensuing elections for members of parliament. These assertions were supported by many incontested facts and shrewd arguments, notwithstanding which, the majority were so little disposed to find fault, that the inquiry issued in a joint-address to the queen, containing resolutions, That timely and effectual care had been taken to disappoint the designs of her ma∣jesty's enemies both at home and abroad. A bill, however, was brought into the house of lords, under the title of <Q>“An act for improving the union of the two kingdoms.”</Q> It related to trials for treason in Scotland, which by this law were regulated according to the manner of proceeding in England, with some small variation. The Scottish members opposed it as an incroachment upon the form of their laws; and they were joined by those who had layed it down as a maxim to oppose all the court-measures: nevertherless, the bill passed thro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both houses, and received the royal assent. Yet, in order to sweeten this unpa∣latable medicine, the queen consented to an act of grace, by which all treasons were pardoned, except those committed on the high-seas: an exception levelled at those who had embarked with the pretender. Major-general Webb, who had been desrauded of his due honour, in a partial representation of the battle of
<PB N="356" REF="3590"/>
Wynendale, transmitted by Cardonnel secretary to the duke of Marlborough, was now thanked by the house of commons for the great and eminent services<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the D. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Hare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> which he had performed in that engagement. This motion was made by the Tories; and the Whigs did not fail to procure a compliment of the same na∣ture to the duke of Marlborough, even before he returned to England. When the news of Ghent's being taken arrived, the lords and commons congratulated the queen on this last great effort of a glorious campaign; and the duke, at his arrival, was thanked in the name of the peers, by the lord-chancellor. As he was supposed to have brought over proposals of peace, the two houses, in an address<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> desired the queen would insist on the demolition of Dunkirk, which was a nest of pyrates that infested the ocean, and did infinite prejudice to the commerce of England. The queen promised to comply with their request. But she was not a little surprised at the next address they presented, humbly intreating, that she would have such indulgence to the hearty desires of her sub∣jects, as to entertain thoughts of a second marriage. She told them, that the provision she had made for the protestant succession would always be a proof how much she had at heart the future happiness of the kingdom; but, the sub∣ject of this address was of such a nature, that she was persuaded they did not expect a particular answer.</P>

<P>The laws having been found insufficient to punish capitally the au∣thors of the insult offered to the M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scovite ambassador, a bill was brought into the house of commons for preserving the privileges of ambassadors and other foreign ministers; and passed through both houses: as did another to prevent the laying of wagers relating to the public, a practice which had been carried to a degree of infatuation; and by which many unwary persons fell a sacrifice to crafty adventurers. On the fourteenth day of March the commons voted the sum of one hundred and three thousand two hundred and three pounds, for the relief of the inhabitants of Nevis and St. Christopher's, who had suffered by the late invasion; and on the twenty-first day of April the parliament was pro∣rogued.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>THE French king was by this time reduced to such a state of humi∣liation by the losses of the last campaign, and a severe winter which completed the misery of his subjects, that he resolved to sacrifice all the considerations of pride and ambition, as well as the interest of his grandson, to his desire of peace, which was now become so necessary and indispensible. He dispatched the president Rouillé privately to Holland, with general proposals of peace, and the offer of a good barrier to the states-general, still entertaining hopes of being able to detach them from the confederacy. This minister con∣ferred in secret with Buys and Vanderdussen, the pensionaries of Amsterdam and Gouda at Moerdyke, from whence he was permitted to proceed to Woerden, between Leyden and Utrecht. The states immediately communicated his pro∣posals
<PB N="358" REF="3610"/>
to the courts of Vienna and Great-Britain. Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough arrived at the Hague in April, and conferred with he grand pensionary Heinsius, Buys, and Vanderduffen, on the subject of the French proposals, which were deemed unsatisfactory. Rouillé immediately dispatched a courier to Paris for further instructions; and the duke of Marlborough re∣turned to England to make the queen acquainted with the progress of the ne∣gotiation. Lewis, in order to convince the states of his sincerity, sent the mar∣quis de Torcy, his secretary for foreign affairs, to the Hague with fresh offers, to which the deputies would make no answer until they knew the sentiments of the queen of Great-Britain. The duke of Marlborough crossed the seas a se∣cond time, accompanied by the lord viscount Town<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hend, as ambassador-ex∣traordinary, and joint-plenipetentiary: Prince Eugene being likewise at the Hague, the conferences were begun. The French minister declared, that his master would consent to the demolition of Dunki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k: that he would abandon the presender, and dismiss him from his dominions: that he would acknowledge the queen's title and the prote<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tant succession: that he would renounce all pre∣tensions to the Spanish monarchy, and cede the places in the Netherlands which the states-general demanded for their barrier: that he would treat with the em∣peror on the footing of the treaty concluded at Ryswick, and even demolish the fortifications of Strasburg. The ministers of the allies, rendered proud and wanton by success, and seeing their own private interest in the continuation of the war, insisted upon the restitution of the Upper and Lower Alface to the empire: upon the French monarch's restoring Strasburg in its present condition: upon his ceding the town and castellany of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, demolishing Dunkirk, New Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ac, Fort Louis, and Hunningen. In a word, their demands were so inso∣lent, that Lewis would not have suffered them to be mentioned in his hearing, had not he been reduced to the last degree of distress. One can hardly read them without feeling a sentiment of compassion for that monarch, who had once given law to Europe, and been so long accustomed to victory and conquest. Notwithstanding the discouraging dispatches he had received from the president Rouille, after his first conferences with the deputies, he could not believe that the Dutch would be so blind to their own interest, as to reject the advantages in commerce, and the barrier which he had offered. He could not conceive, that they would choose to bear the burthen of excessive taxes in prosecuting a war, the events of which would always be uncertain, rather than enjoy the blessings of peace, security, and advantageous commerce: he flattered himself, that the allies would not so far deviate from their purposed aim of establishing a balance of power, as to throw such an enormous weight into the scale of the house of Austria, which cherishedall the dangerous ambition and arbitrary principles, with∣out the liberality and sentiment, peculiar to the house of Bourbon. In proportion as they rose in their demands Lewis fell in his condescension. His secretary of state, the marquis de Torcy, posted in disguise to Holland, on the faith of a common blank passport. He sollicited, he soothed, he supplicated, and made concessions in the name of his sovereign. He found the states were wholly guided by the influence of prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough. He found these generals elated, haughty, overbearing and implacable. He in pri∣vate attacked the duke of Marlborough on his weakest side: he offered to that nobleman a large sum of money, provided he would effect a peace on certain
<PB N="359" REF="3620"/>
conditions. The proposal was rejected. The duke found his enemies in Eng∣land increasing, and his credit at court in the wane; and he knew that nothing but a continuation of the war, and new victories, could support his influence in England. Torcy was sensible that his country was utterly exhausted: that Lewis dreaded nothing so much as the opening of the campaign; and he agreed to those articles upon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which they insisted as preliminaries. The French king was confounded at these proposals: he felt the complicated pangs of grief, shame, and indignation. He rejected the preliminaries with disdain. He even deigned to submit his conduct to the judgment of his subjects. His offers were published, together with the demands of the allies. His people interested themselves in the glory of their monarch. They exclaimed against the cruelty and arrogance of his enemies. Though impoverished and half-starved by the war, they resolved to expend their whole substance in his support; and rather to fight his battles without pay, than leave him in the dire necessity of com∣plying with such dishonourable terms. Animated by these sentiments, they made such efforts as amazed the whole world. The preliminaries being rejected by the French king, Rouillé was ordered to quit Holland in four and twenty hours; and the generals of the confederates resolved to open the campaign with∣out farther hesitation.</P>

<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough proceeded to Flanders, and towards the end of June the allied army encamped in the plain of Lisle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the number of one hundred and ten thousand fighting men. At the same time, the marechal Villars, accounted the most fortunate general in France, assembled the French forces in the plain of Lens, where he began to throw up intrenchments. The confederate generals having observed his situation, and perceiving he could not be attacked with any probability of success, resolved to undertake the siege of Tournay, the garrison of which Villars had impru∣dently weakened. Accordingly they made a feint upon Ypres, in order to de∣ceive the enemy, and convert all their attention to that side, while they sud∣denly invested Tournay on the twenty-seventh day of June. Though the garrison did not exceed twelve weakened battalions, and four squadrons of dragoons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the place was so strong, both by art and nature, and lieutenant de Surville the governor was such an excellent officer, that the siege was protracted, con∣trary to the expectation of the allies, and cost them a great number of men, notwithstanding all the precautions that could be taken for the safety of the troops. As the besiegers proceeded by the method of sap, their miners fre∣quently met with those of the enemy under ground, and fought with bayonet and pistol. The volunteers on both sides presented themselves to these sub∣terraneous combats, in the midst of mines and countermines ready primed for explosion. Sometimes they were kindled by accident, and sometimes sprung by design; so that great numbers of those brave men were stifled below; and whole battalions blown into the air, or buried in the rubbish. On the twenty eighth day of July, the besiegers having effected a practicable breach, and made the necessary dispositions for a general assault, the enemy offered to capitulate: the town was surrendered upon conditions, and the garrison retired to the cita∣del. Surville likewise entered into a treaty about giving up the citadel; and the articles being sent to the court of Versailles, Lewis would not ratify them, except upon condition that there should be a general cessation in the Nether∣lands
<PB N="360" REF="3630"/>
till the fifth day of September. Hostilities were renewed on the eighth day of August, and prosecuted with uncommon ardour and animosity. On the thirtieth, Surville desired to capitulate on certain articles, which were re∣jected by the duke of Marlborough, who gave him to understand that he had no terms to expect, but must surrender at discretion. At length, his provision being quite exhausted, he was obliged to surrender himself and his garrison prisoners of war, though they were permitted to return to France, on giving their parole that they would not act in the field until a like number of the allies should be released.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The next object that attracted the eyes of the confederates, was the city of Mons, which they resolved to besiege with all possible expedition. They passed the Schelde on the third day of September, and detached the prince of Hesse to attack the French lines, from the Haisne to the Sombre, which were abandoned at his approach. On the seventh day of September<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal de Boufflers arrived in the French camp at Quievrain, content to act in an inferior capacity to Villars, although his superior in point of seniority. The duke of Marlborough having received advice that the French were on the march to attack the advanced body under the prince of Hesse, decamped from Havre, in order to support that detachment. On the ninth the allies made a motion to the left, by which the two armies were brought so near each other, that a mutual cannonading ensued. The French army, amounting to one hundred and twenty thousand men, were posted behind the woods of La Merte and Tanieres, in the neighbourhood of Malplaquet. The confederates, nearly of the same number, encamped with the right near Sart and Bleron, and the left on the edge of the wood of Lagniere; the head-quarters being at Blaregnies. The enemy, instead of at∣tacking the allies, began to fortify their camp, which was naturally strong, with triple intrenchments. In a word, they were so covered with lines, hedges, intrenchments, cannon, and trees laid across, that they seemed to be quite inaccessible. Had the confederates attacked them on the ninth, the battle would not have been so bloody, and the victory would have been more decisive; for they had not then begun to secure the camp: but they postponed the en∣gagement until they should be reinforced by eighteen battalions which had been employed in the siege of Tournay; and, in the mean time, the French fortified themselves with incredible diligence and dispatch. On the eleventh day of September, early in the morning, the confederates, favoured by a thick fog, erected batteries on each wing, and in the centre; and about eight o'clock the weather clearing up, the attack began. Eighty-six battalions on the right, commanded by general Schuylemburg, the duke of Argyle, and other gene∣rals, and supported by two and twenty battalions under count Lottum, at∣tacked the left of the enemy with such vigour, that notwithstanding their lines and barricadoes, they were in less than an hour driven from their intrench∣ments, into the woods of Sart and Tanieres. The prince of Orange and baron Fagel, with six and thirty Dutch battalions, advanced against the right of the enemy, posted in the wood of la Merte, and covered with three intrenchments. Here the battle was maintained with the most desperate courage on both sides. The Dutch obliged the French to quit the first intrenchment; but were repulsed from the second with great slaughter. The prince of Orange per∣sisted
<PB N="361" REF="3640"/>
in his efforts with incredible perseverance and intrepidity, even after two horses had been killed under him<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the greater part of his officers either slain or disabled. The French fought with an obstinacy of courage that bordered on despair, till seeing their lines forced, their left wing and centre giving way, and their general Villars dangerously wounded, they made an excellent retreat towards Bavay, under the conduct of Boufflers, and took post between Quesnoy and Valenciennes. The field of battle they abandoned to the confederates, with about forty colours and standards, sixteen pieces of artillery, and a good num∣ber of prisoners: but this was the dearest victory they had ever purchased. Above twenty thousand of their best troops were killed in the engagement; whereas the enemy did not lose half the number, and retired at leisure, per∣fectly recovered of that apprehension with which they had been for some years inspired and overawed by the successes of their adversaries. On the side of the allies, count Lottam, general Tettau, count Oxienstern, and the marquis of Tullibardine were killed, with many other officers of distinction. Prince Eu∣gene was slightly wounded on the head: lieutenant-general Webb received a shot in the groin. The duke of Argyle, who distinguished himself by ex∣traordinary feats of valour, escaped unhurt; but several musket-balls pene∣trated through his cloaths, hat, and periwig. In the French army, the chevalier de St. George charged twelve times with the houshold troops, and in the last was wounded with a sword in the arm. The marechal Villars con∣fidently asserted, that if he himself had not been disabled, the confederates would have certainly been defeated.</P>

<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Considering the situation of the French, the number of their troops, and the manner in which they were fortified, nothing could be more rash and imprudent than the attack, which cost the lives of so many gallant men, and was attended with so little advantage to the conquerors. Perhaps the duke of Marlborough thought a victory was absolutely necessary to support his sinking interest at the court of Great Britain. His intention was to have given battle before the enemy had intrenched themselves; but prince Eugene insisted upon delaying the action until the reinforcement should arrive from Tournay: and the extraordinary carnage is imputed to the impetuosity of the prince of Orange, whose aim, through this whole war, was to raise himself into consideration with the states-general, by signal acts of military prowess. The French having re∣tired to Valenciennes, the allies were left at liberty to besiege Mons, which capitulated about the end of October; and both armies were distributed in winter-quarters. The campaign on the Rhine produced nothing but one sharp action, between a detachment of the French army commanded by the count de Borgh, and a body of troops under count Merci, who had passed the Rhine in order to penetrate into Franche-comté. He was worsted in this encounter, with the loss of two thousand men; obliged to repass the river, and retired to Fribourg. In Piedmont, velt-marechal Thaun commanded the confederates, in the room of the duke of Savoy, who refused to take the field until some differences which had arisen between the emperor and him should be adjusted. Thuan's design was to besiege Briancon; but the duke of Ber∣wick had taken such precautions as frustrated his intention, though part of the troops under the French general were employed in suppressing an insurrection of the Camisars, and other malcontents in the Vivarez. These were intirely de∣feated

In the mean time, the French king withdrew his troops from Spain, on pretence of demonstrating his read<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ness to oblige the allies in that particular; though this measure was the effect of necessity, which obliged him to recall those troops for the defence of his own dominions. The states-general refused to grant passes to the French ministers; but they allowed Petkum to make a journey to Ver∣sailles. In the interim king Philip published a manifesto, protesting against all that should be transac<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed at the Hague to his prejudice. Far from yield∣ing Spain and the Indies to his competitor, he declared his intention of driving Charles from those places that were now in his possession. He named the duke of Alba and count Bergheyck for his plenipotentiaries, and ordered them to notify their credentials to the maritime powers: but no regard was payed to their intimation. Philip tampered likewise with the duke of Marlborough, and the marquis de Torcy renewed his attempts upon that general: but all his application and address proved ineffectual. Petkum brought back from Versailles a kind of memorial, importing, That those motives which influenced the French, before the campaign was opened, no longer subsisted: That the winter season naturally produced a cessation of arms, during which he would treat of a general and reasonable peace, without restricting himself to the form of the preliminaries which the allies had pretended to impose: That, never∣theless, he would still treat on the foundation of those conditions to which he had consented, and send plenipotentiaries to begin the conferences with those of the allies, on the first day of January. The states-general inveighed against this memorial, as a proof of the French king's insincerity; though he cer∣tainly had a right to retract those offers they had formerly rejected. They came to a resolution, that it was absolutely necessary to prosecute the war with vigour; and they wrote p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>essing letters on this subject to all their allies.</P>

<P>The parliament of Great-Britain being assembled on the fifteenth day of November, the queen in her speech told both houses, That the enemy had endeavoured, by false appearances, and deceitful insinuations of a desire after peace, to create jealousies among the allies: That God Almighty had been pleased to bless the arms of the consederates with a most remarkable victory, and other successes, which had laid France open to the impression of the allied arms, and consequently rendered peace more necessary to that kingdom than it was at the beginning of the campaign.

The parliament were as eager and compliant as ever. They presented congratula∣tory addresses: they thanked the duke of Marlborough for his signal services;
<PB N="364" REF="3670"/>
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ile great part of the nation reproached him with having wantonly sacrificed so many thousand lives to his own private interest and reputation. In less than a month, the commons granted upwards of six millions for the service of the en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uing year; and established a lottery, with other funds, to answer this enor∣mous supply. On the thirteenth day of December, Mr. Dolben, son to the late archbishop of York<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> complained to the house, of two sermons preached and published by Dr. Henry Sacheverel, rector of St. Saviour's in Southwark, as contai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing positions contrary to revolution-principles, to the present govern∣ment, and the protestant succession. Sacheverel was a clergyman of narrow in∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llects, and an over-heated imagination. He had acquired some popularity among those who distinguished themselves by the name of High-churchmen; and took all occasions to vent his animosity against the dissenters. At the summer-a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>izes at Derby, he had held forth in that strain before the judges: on the fifth day of November, in St. Paul's church, he, in a violent declama∣tion, defended the doctrine of non-resistance; inveighed against the toleration and di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enters; declared the church was dangerously attacked by her enemies; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lightly defended by her false friends: he sounded the trumpet for the chur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, and exhorted the people to put on the whole armour of God. Sir Sa∣muel Garrard the lord-mayor, countenanced this harrangue, which was pu∣blished under his protection, extolled by the Tories, and circulated all over the nation. The complaint of Mr. Dolben against Sacheverel was seconded in the house of commons, by Sir Peter King, and other members. The most violent paragraphs were read: the sermons were voted scandalous and sediti∣ous libels. Sacheverel being brought to the bar of the house, acknowledged himself the author of both, and mentioned the encouragement he had re∣ceived from the lord-mayor to print that which was intituled, "The perils of false brethren." Sir Samuel, who was a member, denied he had ever given him such encouragement. The doctor being ordered to withdraw, the house resolved he should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanours; and Mr. Dolben was ordered to impeach him at the bar of the house of lords, in the name of all the commons of England. A committee was appointed to draw up articles, and Sacheverel was taken into custody. At the same time, in order to demonstrate their own principles, they resolved, That the reverend Mr. Ben<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amin Hoadly, rector of St. Peter's Poor, for having often justified the principles on which her majesty and the nation proceeded in the late happy revolution, had justly merited the favour and recommendation of the house; and they presented an address to the queen, beseeching her to bestow some dig∣nity in the church on Mr. Hoadly, for his eminent services both to the church and state. The queen returned a civil answer, though she payed no regard to their recommendation. Hoadly was a clergyman of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound understanding, un∣blemished character, and uncommon moderation, who, in a sermon preached before the lord-mayor of London, had demonstrated the lawfulness of resist∣ing wicked and cruel governors; and vindicated the late revolution. By avowing such doctrines, he incurred the resentment of the high-churchmen, who accused him of having preached up rebellion. Many books were written against the maxims he professed. These he answered; and, in the course of the controversy, acquitted himself with superior temper, judgment, and solidity
<PB N="365" REF="3680"/>
of argument. He, as well as bishop Burnet, and several other prelates, had been treated with great virulence in Sacheverel's sermon; and the lord∣treasurer was scurrilously abused under the name of Volpone.</P>

<P>The doctor being impeached at the bar of the upper-house, peti∣tioned that he might be admitted to bail; but this indulgence was refused, and the commons seemed bent upon prosecuting him with such severity as gave disgust to men of moderate principles. Mean while the Tories were not idle. They boldly affirmed that the Whigs had formed a design to pull down the church; and that this prosecution was intended to try their strength, before they would proceed openly to the execution of their project. These assertions were supported, and even credited by great part of the clergy, who did not fail to alarm and inflame their hearers; while emissaries were employed to raise a ferment among the populace, already prepared with discontent, arising from a scarcity which prevailed in almost every country of Europe. These mini∣sters magnified the dangers to which the church was exposed, from dis∣senters, whigs, and lukewarm prelates. These they represented as the authors of a ruinous war, which in a little time would produce universal fa∣mine; and, as the immediate encouragers of those Palatine refugees who had been brought over to the number of six thousand, and maintained by volun∣tary contributions, until they could be conveniently transported into Ireland, and the plantations in America. The charity bestowed upon those unhappy strangers exasperated the poor of England, who felt severely the effects of the dearth, and helped to fill up the measure of popular discontent. The articles against Dr. Sacheverel being exhibited, his person was committed to the de∣puty-usher of the black-rod; and the lords admitted him to bail. Then he drew up an answer to the charge, in which he denied some articles, and others he endeavoured to justify or extenuate. The commons having sent up a re∣plication, declaring they were ready to prove the charge, the lords appointed the twenty-seventh day of February for the trial, in Westminster-hall.</P>

<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were turned upon this extraordinary trial. It lasted three weeks, during which all other business was suspended; and the queen herself was every day present, though in quality of a private spectator. The managers for the commons were Sir Joseph Jekyl, Mr. Eyre sollicitor-general, Sir Peter King recorder of the city of London, lieutenant-general Stanhope, Sir Thomas Parker, and Mr. Robert Walpole treasurer of the navy. The doctor was defended by Sir Simon Harcourt and Mr. Phipps, and assisted by Dr. Atterbury, Dr. Smallridge, and Dr. Friend. A vast mul∣titude attended him every day to and from Westminster-hall, striving to kiss his hand, and praying for his deliverance, as if he had been a martyr and con∣fessor. The queen's sedan was beset by the populace, exclaiming, <Q>“God bless your majesty and the church. We hope your majesty is for Dr. Sacheve∣rel.”</Q> They compelled all persons to lift their hats to the doctor, as he passed in his coach to the Temple, where he lodged; and, among these some members of parliament, who were abused and insulted. They destroyed se∣veral meeting-houses, plundered the dwelling-houses of eminent di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>enters; and threatened to pull down those of the lord chancellor, the earl of Wharton, and the bishop of Sarum.

On the sixteenth day of the month, the queen being in the house incognito, they proceed∣ed to consider whether or not the commons had made good the articles exhibited against Dr. Sach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>verel. The earl of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observed, that the doctor's speech was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> full <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his sermon: that all he had advanced about non-resistance and unlimited obedience was false and ridiculous: that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of passive obedience, as urged by the doctor, was not reconcileable to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that if the revolution was not lawful, many in that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and vast numbers without, were guilty of blood, murder, rapine, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and that the queen herself was no lawful sovereign, since the best title she had to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> founded upon the revolution. He
<PB N="367" REF="3700"/>
was answered by the lord Haversham in a long speech. Lord Ferrers said, if the doctor was guilty of some foolish unguarded expressions, he ought to have been tried at common law. The earl of Scarborough observed, the revolution was a nice point, and above the law: he moved that they should adjourn the debate, and take time to consider before they gave judgment. Doctor Hooper bishop of Bath and Wells allowed the necessity and legality of resistance in some extraordinary cases; but was of opinion, that this maxim ought to be concealed from the knowledge of the people, who are naturally too apt to re∣sist: that the revolution was not to be boasted of, nor made a precedent; but that a mantle ought to be thrown over it, and it should be called a vacancy or abdication. He said the original compact were dangerous words<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not to be mentioned without great caution: that those who examined the revolution too nicely, were no friends to it: and that there seemed to be a necessity for preach∣ing up non-resistance and passive obedience at that time, when resistance was justified. The duke of Argyle affirmed, that the clergy in all ages had de∣livered up the rights and privileges of the people, preaching up the king's power, in order to govern him the more easily; and therefore they o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t not to be suffered to meddle with politics. The earl of Anglesey owned the doctor had preached nonsense; but said that was no crime. The duke of Leeds distin∣guished between resistance and revolution; for, had not the last succeeded, it would have certainly been rebellion, since he knew of no other but hereditary right. The bishop of Salisbury justified resistance from the book of Macca∣b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es: he mentioned the conduct of queen Elizabeth, who assisted the Scots, the French, and the states-general, in resisting their different sovereigns, and was supported in this practice both by her parliaments and her convocations. He observed that king Charles I. had assisted the citizens of Rochelle in their rebellion: that Manwaring incurred a severe censure from the parliament, for having broached the doctrine of the divine right of kings; and that though this became a favourite maxim after the restoration, yet its warmest asserters were the first who pleaded for resistance when they thought themselves oppressed. The archbishop of York, the duke of Buckingham, and other leaders of the Tory-interest, declared that they never read such a piece of madness and nonsense as Sachever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l's sermon; but they did not think him guilty of a misdemeanour. Next day, Dr. Wake bishop of Lincoln accused Sacheverel of having made a strange and false representation of the design for a comprehension, which had been set on foot by archbishop Sancroft, and promoted by the most eminent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the church of England. He was of opinion that some step should be taken for putting a stop to such preaching, as, if not timely corrected, might kindle heats and animosities that would endanger both church and state. Dr. Trimn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l bishop of Norwich expatiated upon the insolence of Sacheverel, who had arraigned archbishop Grindal, one of the eminent reformers, as a perfidi∣ous prelate, for having favoured and tolerated the discipline of Geneva. He enlarged upon the good effects of the toleration. He took notice of Sacheve∣rel's presumption in publishing inflammatory prayers, declaring himself under persecution, while he was prosecuted for offending against the law, by those who in common justice ought to be thought the fairest accusers, and before th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who were justly acknowledged to be the most impartial judges. In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the fourth article, the bishop of Salisbury spoke with great velie∣mence
<PB N="368" REF="3710"/>
against Sacheverel, who, by inveighing against the revolution, tolera∣tion, and union, seemed to arraign and attack the queen herself; since her majesty had so great a share in the first; had often declared she would main∣tain the second; and that she looked upon the third as the most glorious event of her reign. He affirmed, that nothing could be more plain than the doctor's reflecting upon her majesty's ministers; and that he had so well marked out a noble peer there present, by an ugly and scurrilous epithet which he would not repeat, that it was not possible to mistake his meaning. Some of the younger peers could not help laughing at this undesigned sarcasm upon the lord-treasurer, whom Sacheverel had reviled under the name of Volpone: they exclaimed, "Name him, name him;" and, in all probability, the zealous bishop, who was remarkable for absence of mind and unguarded expressions, would have gra∣tified their request, had not the chancellor interposing, declared that no peer was obliged to say more than he should think proper.</P>

<P>After obstinate disputes and much virulent altercation, Sacheverel was found guilty by a majority of seventeen voices; and four and thirty peers entered a protest against this decision. He was prohibited from preaching for the term of three years: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two sermons were ordered to be burned by the hands of the common hangman, in presence of the lord mayor and the two sheriffs of London and Middlesex.

A like sentence was denounced by the commons upon a book intituled, <Q>“Collections of passages referred to by Dr. Sacheverel, in his answer to the articles of impeachment.”</Q> These he had selected from impious books lately published, and they were read by his counsel as proofs that the church was in danger. The lenity of the sentence passed upon Sacheverel, which was in a great measure owing to the dread of popular resentment, his friends considered<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

She declared that no prince could have a more true and tender concern for the welfare and prosperity of the church than she had, and should always have; and she said it was very in∣jurious to take a pretence from wicked and malicious libels, to insinuate that the church was in danger by her administration.</P>

<P>The French king seeing the misery of his people daily increase, and all his resources fail, humbled himself again before the allies, and by the means of Petkum, who still corresponded with his ministers, implored the states-general, that the negotiation might be resumed. In order to facilitate their consent, he dispatched a new project of pacification, in which he promised to renounce his grandson, and to comply with all their other demands, provided the electors of Cologne and Bavaria should be re-established in their estates and dignities. These overtures being rejected, another plan was offered, and communicated to the plenipotentiaries of the emperor and queen of Great-Britain. Then Petkum wrote a letter to the marquis de Torcy, intimating, that the allies re∣quired his most christian majesty should declare in plain and expressive terms,
<PB N="369" REF="3720"/>
that he consented to all the preliminaries, except the thirty-seventh article, which stipulated a cessation of arms, in case the Spanish monarchy should be delivered to king Charles in the space of two months. He said, the allies would send pass∣ports to the French ministers to treat of an equivalent for that article. Lewis was even forced to swallow this bitter draught. He signified his consent, and appointed the marechal D'Uxelles and the abbé Polignae his ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipotentiaries. They were not suffered, however, to enter Holland, but were met by the de∣puties Buys and Vanderdussen at Gertruydenberg.

The two houses of parliament se∣conded their request in a joint-address to her majesty, who told them she had al∣ready given directions for his departure; and said, she was glad to find they concurred with her in a just sense of the duke's eminent services. Both the letter and the address were procured by the interest of Marlborough, to let the queen see how much that nobleman was considered both at home and abroad.

In vain the plenipotentiaries declared, that the French king could not with decency, or the least regard to his honour, wage war against his own grandson: the deputies insisted upon his effecting the ces∣sion of Spain and the Indies to the house of Austria; and submitting to every other article specified in the preliminaries. Nay, they even reserved to themselves a power of making ulterior demands after the preliminaries should be adjusted. Lewis proposed, that some small provision should be made for the duke of Anjou, which might induce him to relinquish Spain the more easily. He mentioned the kingdom of Arragon; and this hint being disagreeable to the allies, he demanded Naples and Sicily. When they urged, that Naples was already in possession of the house of Austria, he restricted the provision to Sicily and Sardinia. He offered to deliver up four cautionary towns in Flanders, as a security for Philip's evacuating Spain; and even promised to supply the confe∣derates with a monthly sum of money, to defray the expence of expelling that prince from his dominions, should he refuse to resign them with a good grace. The substance of all the conferences was communicated to lord Townshend and count Zinzendorf, the Imperial plenipotentiary; but the conduct of the de∣puties was regulated by the pensionary Heinsius, who was firmly attached to prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough, more averse than ever to a pacification. The negotiation lasted from the nineteenth day of March to the twenty-fifth of July, during which term the conferences were several times interrupted, and a great many dispatches and new proposals arrived from Ver∣sailles. At length, the plenipotentiaries returned to France, after having sent a letter to the pensionary, in which they declared, that the proposals made by the deputies were unjust and impracticable; and complained of the unworthy treatment to which they had been exposed. Lewis resolved to hazard another
<PB N="370" REF="3730"/>
campaign, not without hope, that there might be some lucky incident in the events of war, and that the approaching revolution in the English ministry, of which he was well apprised, would be productive of a more reasonable pacification. The states-general resolved, That the enemy had departed from the foundation on which the negotiation had begun, and studied pretences to evade the execu∣tion of the capital points, the restitution of Spain and the Indies; and in short, that France had no other view than to sow and create jealousy and disunion among the allies. Lord Townshend, in a memorial assured them, that the queen intirely approved their resolution, and all the steps they had taken in the course of the negotiation; and, that she was firmly resolved to prosecute the war with all possible vigour, until the enemy should accept such terms of peace as might secure the tranquillity of the christian world.</P>

<P>The conferences did not retard the operations of the campaign. Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough set out from the Hague on the fifteenth day of March for Tournay, in order to assemble the forces which were quartered on the Maese, in Flanders, and Brabant. On the twentieth of April they suddenly advanced to Pont a-Vendin, in order to attack the lines upon which the French had been at work all the winter, hoping by these to cover Doway and other frontier towns, which were threatened by the confede∣rates. The troops left for the defence of the lines retired without opposition. The allies having layed bridges over the Scarpe, the duke of Marlborough with his division passed that river, and encamped at Vitri. Prince Eugene remained on the other side and invested Doway, the enemy retiring towards Cambray. Marechal Villars still commanded the French army, which was extremely nu∣merous and well appointed, considering the distress of that kingdom. Indeed, the number was augmented by this distress; for, many thousands saved them∣selves from dying of hunger by carrying arms in the service. The marechal having assembled all his forces, passed the Schelde, and encamped at Bouchain, declaring, that he would give battle to the confederates: an alteration was im∣mediately made in the disposition of the allies, and proper precautions taken for his reception. He advanced in order of battle; but having viewed the situation of the confederates, he marched back to the heights of St. Laurence, where he fixed his camp. His aim was by continual alarms to interrupt the siege of Doway, which was vigorously defended by a numerous garrison, under the com∣mand of monsieur Albergotti, who made a number of successful sallies, in which the besiegers lost a great number of men. They were likewise repulsed in several assaults; but still proceeded with unremitting vigour, until the besieged being reduced to the last extremity, were obliged to capitulate on the twenty-sixth of June, fifty days after the trenches had been opened. The generals finding it impracticable to attack the enemy, who were posted within strong lines from Arras towards Miramont, resolved to besiege Bethune, which was invested on the fifteenth day of July, and surrendered on the twenty-ninth of August. Villars marched out of his intrenchments with a view to raise the siege; but he did not think proper to hazard an engagement: some warm skirmishes, however, happened between the foragers of the two armies. After the reduction of Bethune, the allies besieged at one time the towns of Aire and St. Venant, which were taken without much difficulty. Then the armies broke up and marched into winter-quarters.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The campaign on the Rhine was productive of no military event: nor was any thing of consequence transacted in Piedmont. The duke of Savoy being indisposed and out of humour, the command of the forces still continued vested in count Thaun, who endeavoured to pass the Alps and penetrate into Dauphiné; but the duke of Berwick had cast up intrenchments in the mountains, and taken such precautions to guard them, as baffled all the attempts of the Im∣perial general. Spain was much more fruitful of military incidents. The horse and dragoons in the army of king Charles, headed by general Stanhope, at∣tacked the whole cavalry of the enemy at Almennara. Stanhope charged in person, and with his own hand slew general Amessaga, who commanded the guards of Philip. The Spanish horse were intirely routed, together with nine battalions that escaped by favour of the darkness; and the main body of the army retired with precipitation to Lerida. General Staremberg pursued them to Saragossa, where he found them drawn up in order of battle; and an engagement ensuing on the ninth day of August, the enemy was totally defeated: five thousand of their men were killed, seven thousand taken, together with all their artillery, and a great number of colours and standards. King Charles entered Saragossa in triumph, while Philip with the wreck of his army retreated to Madrid. Hav∣ing sent his queen and son to Victoria, he retired to Valladolid, in order to collect his scattered troops so as to form another army. The good fortune of Charles was of short duration. Stanhope proposed, that he should immediately secure Pampeluna, the only pass by which the French king could send troops to Spain. But this salutary scheme was rejected, and king Charles proceeded to Madrid, which was deserted by all the grandees; and he had the mortification to see that the Castilians were universally attached to his competitor.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>While his forces continued cantoned in the neighbourhood of Toledo, the king of France, at the request of Philip, sent the duke of Vendome to take the command of the Spanish army, which was at the same time reinforced by detachments of French troops. Vendome's reputation was so high, and his person so beloved by the soldiery, that his presence was almost equivalent to an army. A great number of volunteers immediately assembled to signalize them∣selves under the eye of this renowned general. The Castilians were inspired with fresh courage, and made surprising efforts in favour of their sovereign; so that in less than theee months after his defeat at Saragossa, he was in a condition to go in quest of his rival. Charles, on the other hand, was totally neglected by the courts of Vienna and Great Britain, which took no steps to supply his wants, or enable him to prosecute the advantages he had gained. In the begin∣ning of November his army marched back to Saragossa, and was cantoned in the neighbourhood of Cifuentes, where Staremberg established his head-quarters. General Stanhope with the British forces was quartered in the little town of Brihuega, where, on the twenty-seventh day of the month he found himself suddenly surrounded by the whole Spanish army. As the place was not tena∣ble, and he had very little ammunition, he was obliged, after a short, but vigo∣rous resistance, to capitulate, and surrender himself and all his forces prisoners of war, to the amount of two thousand men, including three lieutenant-generals, one major-general, one brigadier, with all the colonels and officers of the re∣spective regiments. He was greatly censured for having allowed himself to be surprised; for, if he had placed a guard upon the neighbouring hills, according
<PB N="372" REF="3750"/>
to the advice of general Carpenter, he might have received notice of the enemy's approach time enough to retire to Cifuentes. Thither he detached his aid du∣camp with an account of his situation, on the appearance of the Spanish army; and Staremberg immediately assembled his forces. About eleven in the fore∣noon they began to march towards Brihuega; but the roads were so bad, that night overtook them before they reached the heights in the neighbourhood of that place. Staremberg is said to have loitered away his time unneces∣sarily, from motives of envy to the English general, who had surrendered before his arrival. The troops lay all night on their arms near Villa-viciosa, and on the twenty-ninth were attacked by the enemy, who doubled their number. Sta∣remberg's left wing was utterly defeated, all the infantry that composed it, hav∣ing been either cut in pieces or taken; but the victors, instead of following the blow, began to plunder the baggage; and Staremberg with his right wing fought their left with surprising valour and perseverance till night. Then they retired in disorder, leaving him master of the field of battle and of all their artil∣lery. Six thousand of the enemy were killed on the spot: but the allies had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffered so severly that the general could not maintain his ground. He or∣dered the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>non to be nailed up, and marched to Saragossa, from whence he retired to Catalonia. Thither he was pursued by the duke de Vendome, who red<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>daguer, in which he had left a garrison, and compelled him to take shelter under the walls of Barcelona.

Nothing of consequence was atchieved on the side of Portugal, from whence the earl of Galway returned to England by the queen's perm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ion. After the battle of Pultowa the czar of Muscovy reduced all Li∣von<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a; but he and king Augustus agreed to a neutrality for Pomerania.

They were flattered with hopes of auxiliaries from the Turks; and expected engineers and money from the French monarch.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>In England the effects of those intrigues which had been formed against the Whig ministers began to appear. The trial of Sacheverel had ex∣cited a popular spirit of aversion to those who favoured the dissenters. From all parts of the kingdom addresses were presented to the queen, censuring all resistance as a rebel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous doctrine, founded upon antimonarchical and republican principles. At the same time counter addresses were procured by the Whigs, extolling the revolution, and magnifying the conduct of the present parliament. The queen began to express her attachment to the Tories, by mortifying the duke of Marlborough. Upon the death of the earl of Essex she wrote to the general, desiring, that the regiment which had been commanded by that noble∣man, should be given to Mr. Hill brother to Mrs. Masham, who had sup∣planted the dutchess of Marlborough in the queen's friendship, and was in effect the source of this political revolution. The duke represented to her majesty in
<PB N="373" REF="3760"/>
person, the prejudice that would redound to the service from the promotion of such a young officer over the heads of a great many brave men, who had ex∣hibited repeated proofs of valour and capacity. He expostulated with his sovereign on this extraordinary mark of partial regard to the brother of Mrs. Masham, which he could not help considering as a declaration against himself and his family, who had so much cause to complain of that lady's malice and ingratitude. To this remonstrance the queen made no other reply, but that he would do well to consult his friends. The earl of Godolphin enforced his friend's arguments, though without effect; and the duke retired in disgust to Windsor. The queen appeared at council without taking the least notice of his absence, which did not fail to alarm the whole Whig faction. Several no∣blemen ventured to speak to her majesty on the subject, and explain the bad consequences of disobliging a man who had done such eminent services to the nation. She told them, his services were still fresh in her memory; and, that she retained all her former kindness for his person. Hearing, however, that a popular clamour was raised, and that the house of commons intended to pass some votes that would be disagreeable to her and her new counsellors, she or∣dered the earl of Godolphin to write to the duke, to dispose of the regiment as he should think proper, and return to town immediately. Before he received this intimation he had sent a letter to the queen, desiring she would permit him to retire from business. In answer to this petition, she assured him, his suspi∣cions were groundless, and insisted upon his coming to council. The dutchess demanded an audience of her majesty, on pretence of vindicating her own cha∣racter from some aspersions. She hoped to work upon the queen's tenderness, and retrieve the influence she had lost. She protested, argued, wept, and sup∣plicated: but, the queen was too well pleased with her own deliverance from the tyranny of the other's friendship, to incur such slavery for the future. All the humiliation of the dutchess served only to render herself the more contempt∣ible. The queen heard her without exhibiting the least sign of emotion, and all she would vouchsafe, was a repetition of these words, <Q>“You desired no answer, and you shall have none:”</Q> alluding to an expression in a letter she had re∣ceived from the dutchess. As an additional mortification to the ministry, the office of lord chamberlain was transferred from the duke of Kent to the duke of Shrewsbury, who had lately voted with the Tories, and maintained an inti∣macy of correspondence with Mr. Harley. The interest of the duke of Marl∣borough was not even sufficient to prevent the dismission of his own son-in law the earl of Sunderland from the post of secretary of state, in which he was succeeded by the lord Dartmouth.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The queen was generally applauded for thus asserting her just prero∣gative, and setting herself free from an arbitrary cabal, by which she had been so long kept in dependence. The duke of Beaufort went to court on this occasion, and told her majesty, he was extremely glad that he could now salute her queen in reality. The whole Whig party were justly alarmed at these alterations. The directors of the bank represented to her majesty the prejudice that would un∣doubtedly accrue to public credit from a change of the ministry. The emperor and the states-general interposed in this domestic revolution. Their ministers at London presented memorials, explaining in what manner foreign affairs would be influenced by an alteration in the British ministry. The queen assured them, that whatever changes might be made, the duke of Marlborough should
<PB N="374" REF="3770"/>
be continued in his employments. In the month of August the earl of Godol∣phin was divested of his office, and the treasury put in commission, subjected to the direction of Harley, appointed chancellor of the exchequer and under∣treasurer. The earl of Rochester was declared president of the council, in the room of lord Somers: the staff of lord-steward being taken from the duke of Devonshire, was given to the duke of Buckingham; and Mr. Boyle was re∣moved from the secretary's office, to make way for Mr. Henry St. John. The lord-chancellor having resigned the great seal, it was first put in commission, and afterwards given to Sir Simon Harcourt. The earl of Wharton surrendered his commission of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, which the queen conferred on the duke of Ormond. The earl of Orford withdrew himself from the board of ad∣miralty; and Mr. George Granville was appointed secretary of war, in the room of Mr Robert Walpole. The command of the forces in Portugal was bestowed upon the earl of Portmore: the duke of Hamilton was appointed lord-lieute∣nant of the county palatine of Lancaster. In a word, there was not one Whig left in any office of state, except the duke of Marlborough, who would have renounced his command, had not he been earnestly dissuaded by his particular friends, from taking such a step as might have been prejudicial to the interest of the nation. That the triumph of the Tories might be complete, the queen dissolved the Whig parliament, after such precautions were taken as could not fail to influence the new election, in favour of the other party.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>To this end nothing so effectually contributed as did the trial of Sa∣cheverel, who was used as an instrument and tool to wind and turn the passions of the vulgar. Having been presented to a benefice in North-Wales, he went in procession to that country with all the pomp and magnificence of a sovereign prince. He was sumptuously entertained by the university of Oxford, and dif∣ferent noblemen, who, while they worshipped him as the idol of their faction, could not help despising the object of their adoration. He was received in several towns by the magistrates of the corporation in their formalities, and often attended by a body of a thousand horse. At Bridgnorth he was met by Mr. Cres∣well, at the head of four thousand horse, and the like number of persons on foot, wearing white knots edged with gold, and three leaves of gilt laurel in their hats. The hedges were for two miles dressed with garlands of flowers, and lined with people; and the steeples covered with streamers, flags, and colours. No∣thing was heard but the cry of "the church and Dr. Sacheverel." The clergy were actuated by a spirit of enthusiasm, which seemed to spread like a contagion through all ranks and degrees of people, and had such effect upon the elections for the new parliament, that very few were returned as members but such as had distinguished themselves by their zeal against the Whig administration. Now the queen had the pleasure to see all the offices of state, the lieutenancy of Lon∣don, the management of corporations, and the direction of both houses of parlia∣ment in the hands of the Tories. When these met on the twenty-fifth day of No∣vember, Mr. Bromley was chosen speaker without opposition. The queen in her speech recommended the prosecution of the war with vigour, especially in Spain. She declared herself resolved to support the church of England; to preserve the British constitution according to the union; to maintain the indulgence by law al∣lowed to scrupulous consciences; and to employ none but such as were heartily attached to the protestant succession in the house of Hanover. The lords, in their address, promised to concur in all reasonable measures towards procuring an honourable
<PB N="375" REF="3780"/>
peace. The commons were more warm and hearty in their assurances, exhorting her majesty to discountenance all such principles and measures as had lately threatened her royal crown and dignity; measures, which whenever they might prevail, would prove fatal to the whole constitution both in church and state. After this declaration they proceeded to consider the estimates, and chear∣fully granted the supplies for the ensuing year, part of which was raised by two lotteries. In the house of peers the earl of Scarborough moved, that the thanks of the house should be returned to the duke of Marlborough; but the duke of Argyle made some objections to the motion, and the general's friends dreading the consequence of putting the question, postponed the consideration of this proposal until the duke should return from the continent. The earl of Peterborough was appointed ambassador extraordinary to the Imperial court: the earl of Rivers was sent in the same quality to Hanover; and Mr. Richard Hill nominated envoy extraordinary to the United Provinces, as well as to the council of state appointed for the government of the Spanish Netherlands, in the room of lieutenant-general Cadogan. Meredith, Macartney, and Honeywood were deprived of their regiments, because in their cups they had drank confu∣sion to the enemies of the duke of Marlborough.</P>

<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>This nobleman arrived in England towards the latter end of Decem∣ber. He conferred about half an hour in private with the queen, and next morning assisted at a committee of the privy-council. Her majesty gave him to understand, that he needed not expect the thanks of the parliament as for∣merly; and told him she hoped he would live well with her ministers. He expressed no resentment at the alterations which had been made; but resolved to acquiesce in the queen's pleasure, and retain the command of the army on her own terms. On the second day of January the queen sent a message to both houses, intimating, that there had been an action in Spain to the disadvantage of king Charles: that the damage having fallen particularly on the English forces, she had given directions for sending and procuring troops to repair the loss, and hoped the parliament would approve her conduct. Both houses seized this op∣portunity of venting their spleen against the old ministry. The history of Eng∣land is disgraced by the violent conduct of two turbulent factions, that in their turn engrossed the administration and legislative power. The parliamentary strain was quite altered. One can hardly conceive how resolutions so widely different could be taken on the same subject, with any shadow of reason and decorum. Marlborough, who but a few months before had been so highly ex∣tolled and caressed by the representatives of the people, was now become the object of parliamentary hatred and censure, though no sensible alteration had happened in his conduct or success. That hero, who had retrieved the glory of the British arms, won so many battles, subdued such a number of towns and districts, humbled the pride, and checked the ambition of France, secured the liberty of Europe; and, as it were, chained victory to his chariot wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ls; was in a few weeks dwindled into an object of contempt and derision. He was ridiculed in public libels, and reviled in private conversation. Instances were every where repeated of his fraud, avarice, and extortion; his insolence, cruelty, ambition, and misconduct: even his courage was called in question; and this consummate general was represented as the lowest of mankind. So un∣stable is the popularity of every character that fluctuates between two opposite tides of faction.</P>

<P>The lords in their answer to the queen's message, declared, that as the misfortune in Spain might have been occasioned by some preceding misma∣nagement, they would use their utmost endeavours to discover it, so as to pre∣vent the like for the future. They set on foot an inquiry concerning the affairs of Spain; and the earl of Peterborough being examined before the committee, imputed all the miscarriages in the course of that war to the earl of Galway and general Stanhope. Notwithstanding the defence of Galway, which was clear and convincing, the house resolved, That the earl of Peterborough had given a faithful and honourable account of the councils of war in Valencia: That the earl of Galway, the lord Tyrawley, and general Stanhope, in advising an offen∣sive war, had been the unhappy occasion of the battle at Almanza, the source of our misfortunes in Spain, and one great cause of the disappointment from the expedition to Toulon, concerted with her majesty. They voted, That the prosecution of an offensive war in Spain was approved and directed by the ministers, who were therefore justly blameable, as having contributed to all our misfortunes in Spain, and to the disappointment of the expe∣dition against <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oulon: That the earl of Peterborough, during his command in Spain, had performed many great and eminent services; and, if his opinion had been followed, it might have prevented the misfortunes that ensued. Then the duke of Buckingham moved, That the thanks of the house should be given to the earl for his remarkable and eminent services: and these he actually received from the mouth of the lord-keeper Harcourt, who took this opportunity to drop some oblique reflections upon the mercenary disposition of the duke of Marlborough. The house proceeding in the inquiry, passed another vote, im∣porting, That the late ministry had been negligent in managing the Spanish war, to the great prejudice of the nation. Fineing that the Portuguese troops were posted on the right of the English at the battle of Almanza, they resolved, That the earl of Galway, in yielding this point, had acted contrary to the honour of the imperial crown of Great Britain. These resolutions they included in an address to the queen, who had been present during the debates, which were ex∣tremely violent; and to every separate vote was attached a severe protest. These were not the proceedings of candour and national justice, but the ebullitions of party zeal and rancorous animosity.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>While the lords were employed in this inquiry, the commons ex∣amined certain abuses which had crept into the management of the navy; and some censures were passed upon certain persons concerned in contracts for vic∣tualling the seamen. The inhabitants of St. Olave's and other parishes pre∣sented a petition, complaining, that a great number of Palatines inhabiting one house might produce among them a contagious distemper; and in time be∣come a charge to the public, as they were destitute of all visible means of sub∣sistence. This petition had been procured by the Tories, that the house of commons might have another handle for attacking the late ministry. A com∣mittee was appointed to inquire upon what invitation or encouragement those Palatines had come to England. The papers relating to this affair being layed before them by the queen's order, and perused, the house resolved, That the inviting and bringing over the poor Palatines of all religions, at the public ex∣pence, was an extravagant and unreasonable charge to the kingdom, and a scandalous misapplication of the public money, tending to the increase and oppression of the poor, and of dangerous consequence to the constitution in
<PB N="377" REF="3800"/>
church and state<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and, That whatever advised their being brought over, was an enemy to the queen and kingdom. Animated by the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat of this inquiry, they passed the bill to repeal the act for a general naturalization of all protes∣tants; but this was rejected in the house of lords. Another bill was enacted into a law, importing, That no person should be deemed qualified for repre∣senting a county in parliament, unless he possessed an estate of six hundred pounds a-year; and restricting the qualification of burgess to half that sum. The design of this bill was, to exclude trading people from the house of com∣mons, and to lodge the legislative power with the land-holders. A third act passed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> permitting the importation of French wine in neutral bottoms: a bill against which the Whigs loudly exclaimed, as a national evil and a scandalous compliment to the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A violent party in the house of commons began to look upon Har∣ley as a lukewarm Tory, because he would not enter precipitately into all their factious measures: they even began to suspect his principles, when his credit was re-established by a very singular incident. Guiscard the French partisan, of whom mention hath already been made, thought himself very ill rewarded for his services with a precarious pension of four hundred pounds, which he en∣joyed from the queen's bounty. He had been renounced by St. John the for∣mer companion of his pleasures: he had in vain endeavoured to obtain an au∣dience of the queen, with a view to demand more considerable appointments. Harley was his enemy, and all access to her majesty was denied. Enraged at these disappointments, he attempted to make his peace with the court of France, and offered his services, in a letter to one Moreau a banker in Paris. His packet, which he endeavoured to transmit by the way of Portugal, was inter∣cepted, and a warrant issued out to apprehend him for high-treason. When the messenger disarmed him in St. James's park, he exhibited marks of guilty confusion and despair, and begged that he would kill him directly. Being conveyed to the Cockpit in a sort of frenzy, he perceived a penknife lying upon a table, and took it up without being perceived by his attendants. A committee of council was immediately summoned, and Guiscard brought before them to be examined. Finding that his correspondence with Moreau was discovered, he desired to speak in private with secretary St. John, whom, in all probability, he had resolved to assassinate. His request being refused, he said, <Q>“That's hard! not one word!”</Q> St. John being out of his reach, he stepped up to Mr. Harley, and exclaiming, "Have at thee, then," stabbed him in the breast with the penknife which he had concealed. The instrument broke upon the bone without penetrating into the cavity: nevertheless, he repeated the blow with such force, that the chancellor of the exchequer fell to the ground. Se∣cretary St. John seeing him fall, cried out, <Q>“The villain has killed Mr. Harley!”</Q> and drew his sword. Several other members followed his exam∣ple, and wounded Guiscard in several places. Yet, he made a desperate defence, until he was overpowered by the messengers and servants, and conveyed from the council-chamber, which he had filled with terror, tumult, and confusion. His wounds, though dangerous, were not mortal; but he died of a gangrene occasioned by the bruises he had sustained. This attempt upon the life of Harley, by a person who wanted to establish a traiterous correspondence with France, extinguished the suspicions of those who began to doubt that minis∣ter's
<PB N="378" REF="3810"/>
integrity. The two houses of parliament, in an address to the queen, de∣clared their belief, that Mr. Harley's fidelity to her majesty, and zeal for her<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> service<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had drawn upon him the hatred of all the abettors of popery and fac∣tion. They besought her majesty, to take all possible care of her sacred person; and, for that purpose, to give directions for causing papists to be removed from the cities of London and Westminster. A proclamation was published, or∣dering the laws to be strictly put in execution against papists. When Harley appeared in the house of commons after his recovery, he was congratulated upon it by the speaker in a florid and fulsome premeditated speech.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The commons impowered certain persons to examine all the grants made by king William, and report the value of them, as well as the considerations upon which they were made. Upon their report a bill was formed, and passed that house; but the lords rejected it at the first reading. Their next step was to examine the public accounts, with a view to fix an imputation on the earl of Godolphin. They voted, That above five and thirty millions of the money granted by parliament remained unaccounted for. This sum, however, included some accounts in the reigns of king Charles and king William. One half of the whole was charged to Mr. Bridges the paymaster, who had actually ac∣counted for all the money he had received, except about three millions, though these accounts had not passed through the auditor's office. The commons after∣wards proceeded to inquire into the debts of the navy, that exceeded five millions, which with many other debts were thrown into one stock, amounting to nine millions four hundred and seventy-one thousand, three hundred and twenty-five pounds. A fund was formed for paying an interest or annuity of six per cent. until the principal should be discharged; and with this was granted a monopoly of a projected trade to the South-sea, vested in the proprietors of navy-bills, de∣bentures, and other public securities, which were incorporated for this purpose. Such was the origin of the South-sea company, founded upon a chimerical supposition, that the English would be permitted to trade upon the coast of Peru in the West-Indies. Perhaps, the new ministry hoped to obtain this per∣mission as an equivalent for their abandoning the interest of king Charles with respect to his pretensions upon Spain. By this time the emperor Joseph had died of the small-pox without male issue; so that his brother's immediate aim was to succeed him on the Imperial throne. This event was on the twentieth day of April communicated by a message from the queen to both houses. She told them, that the states-general had concurred with her in a resolution to sup∣port the house of Austria; and, that they had already taken such measures as would secure the election of Charles as head of the empire.</P>

<P>The house of commons, in order to demonstrate their attachment to the church, in consequence of an address from the lower house of convoca∣tion, and a quickening message from the queen, passed a bill for building fifty new churches in the suburbs of London and Westminster, and appropriated
<PB N="379" REF="3820"/>
for this purpose the duty upon coals, which had been granted for the building of St. Paul's, now finished. This imposition was continued until it should raise the sum of three hundred and fifty thousand pounds. At the close of the session the commons presented a remonstrance or representation to the queen, in which they told her, that they had not only raised the necessary supplies, but also dis∣charged the heavy debts of which the nation had so long and justly complained. They said, that in tracing the causes of this debt, they had discovered fraud, embezzlement, and misapplication of the public money: that they who of late years had the management of the treasury, were guilty of notorious breach of trust and injustice to the nation, in allowing above thirty millions to remain unaccounted for; a purposed omission that looked like a design to conceal em∣bezzlements. They begged her majesty would give immediate directions for compelling the several imprest accountants speedily to pass their accounts. They expressed their hope, that such of the accountants as had neglected their duty in prosecuting their accounts, ought no longer to be intrusted with the public money. They affirmed, that from all these evil practices and worse designs of some persons, who had by false professions of love to their country, insinuated themselves into her royal favour, irreparable mischief would have accrued to the public, had not her majesty, in her great wisdom, seasonably discovered the fatal tendency of such measures, and removed from the administration those who had so ill answered her majesty's favourable opinion, and in so many instances grosly abused the trust reposed in them. They observed, that her people could with greater patience have suffered the manifold injuries done to themselves, by the frauds and depredations of such evil ministers, had not the same men proceeded to treat her sacred person with undutifulness and disregard. This re∣presentation being circulated through the kingdom, produced the desired effect of inflaming the minds of the people against the late ministry. Such expedi∣ents were become necessary for the execution of Oxford's project, which was to put a speedy end to a war that had already subjected the people to grievous op∣pression, and even accumulated heavy burdens to be transmitted to their poste∣rity. The nation was inspired by extravagant ideas of glory and conquest, even to a rage of war-making; so that the new ministers, in order to dispel those dangerous chimeras, were obliged to take measures for exciting their indigna∣tion and contempt against those persons whom they had formerly idolized as their heroes and patriots. On the twelfth day of June the queen having given the royal assent to several public and private bills, made an affectionate speech to both houses. She thanked the commons in the warmest expressions for having complied with all her desires; for having baffled the expectations of her ene∣mies in finding supplies for the service of the ensuing year; in having granted greater sums than were ever given to any prince in one session; and in hav∣ing settled funds for the payment of the public debts; so that the credit of the nation was restored. She expressed her earnest concern for the succession of the house of Hanover; and her fixed resolution to support and encourage the church of England as by law established. Then the parliament was pro∣rogued.</P>

<P>Of the convocation which was assembled with the new parliament, the lower house chose Dr. Atterbury their prolocutor. He was an enterprising ec∣clesiastic of extensive learning, acute talents, violently attached to Tory prin∣ciples,
<PB N="380" REF="3830"/>
and intimately connected with the prime minister Oxford; so that he directed all the proceedings in the lower house of convocation in concert with that minister. The queen, in a letter to the archbishop, signified her hope, that the consultations of the clergy might be of use to repress the attempts of loose and profane persons. She sent a licence under the broad seal, impowering them to sit and do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usiness, in as ample a manner as ever had been granted since the reformation. They were ordered to lay before the queen an account of the excessive growth of infidelity and heresy, as well as of other abuses, that neces∣sary measures might be taken for a reformation. The bishops were purposely slighted and over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ooked, because they had lived in harmony with the late minis∣ters. A committee being appointed to draw up a representation of the present state of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e church and religion, Atterbury undertook the task, and composed a remonstrance that contained the most keen and severe strictures upon the ad∣ministration, as it had been exercised since the time of the revolution. An∣other was penned by the bishops in more moderate terms; and several regula∣tions were made, but in none of these did the two houses agree. They con∣curred, however, in censuring some tenets favouring Arianism, broached and supported by Mr. Whiston, mathematical professor in Cambridge. He had been expelled the university, and wrote a vindication of himself, dedicated to the convocation. The archbishop doubted whether this assemby could proceed against a man for heresy: the judges were consulted, and the majority of them gave in their opinion, that the convocation had a jurisdiction. Four of them professed the contrary sentiment, which they maintained from the statutes made at the reformation. The queen, in a letter to the bishops, said, that as there was now no doubt of their jurisdiction, she expected they would proceed in the matter before them. Fresh scruples arising, they determined to examine the book, without proceeding aga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nst the author, and this was censured accordingly. An extract of the sentence was sent to the queen; but she did not signify her pleasure on this subject, and the affair remained in suspence. Whiston pub∣lished a work in four volumes, justifying his doctrine, and maintaining, that the apostolical constitutions were not only canonical, but also preferable in point of authority to the epistles and the gospel.</P>

<P>The new ministry had not yet determined to supersede the duke of Marlborough in the command of the army. This was a step which could not be taken without giving umbrage to the Dutch and other allies. He therefore set out for Holland in the month of February, after the queen had assured him, that he might depend upon the punctual payment of the forces. Having con∣ferred with the deputies of the states about the operations of the campaign, he about the middle of April assembled the army at Orchies, between Lisle and Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay; while marechal de Villars drew together the French troops in the neighbourhood of Cambray and Arras. Lewis had by this time depopulated as well as impoverished his kingdom; yet his subjects still flocked to his stand∣ard with surprising spirit and attachment. Under the pressure of extreme mi∣sery they uttered not one complaint of their sovereign; but imputed all their calamities to the pride and obstinacy of the allies. Exclusive of all the other impositions that were layed upon that people, they consented to pay the tenth penny of their whole substance; but all their efforts of loyalty and af∣fection to their prince would have been ineffectual, had not the merchants of
<PB N="381" REF="3840"/>
the kingdom, by the permission of Philip, undertaken repeated voyages to the South-sea, from whence they brought home immense treasures: while the allies took no steps for intercepting these supplies, though nothing could have been more easy for the English than to deprive the enemy of this great resource, and convert it to their own advantage. Had a squadron of ships been annually em∣ployed for this purpose, the subjects of France and Spain must have been lite∣rally starved, and Lewis obliged to submit to such terms as the confederates might have thought proper to impose. Villars had found means to assemble a very numerous army, with which he encamped behind the river Sanset, in such an advantageous post as could not be attacked with any prospect of success<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mean while the duke of Marlborough passed the Scarpe, and formed his camp between Do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay and Bouchain, where he was joined by prince Eugene on the twenty-third day of May. This general, however, did not long remain in the Netherlands. Understanding that detachments had been made from the army of Villars to the Rhine, and that the elector of Bavaria intended to act in the empire, he, by order from the court of Vienna, marched towards the Upper Rhine with the Imperial and Palatine troops to secure Germany. The duke of Marlborough repassing the Scarpe, encamped in the plains of Lens, from whence he advanced towards Aire, as if he had intended to attack the French lines in that quarter. These lines beginning at Bouchain on the Scheld, were continued along the Sanset and the Scarpe to Arras, and thence along the Upper Scarpe to Canché. They were defended by redoubts and other works, in such a manner, that Villars judged they were impenetrable, and called them the Ne plus ultra of Marlborough.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>This nobleman advancing within two leagues of the French lines, ordered a great number of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ascines to be made, declaring he would attack them the next morning; so that Villars drew all his forces on that side, in full ex∣pectation of an engagement. The duke, on the supposition that the passage of the Sanset by Arleux would be left unguarded, had ordered the generals Ca∣dogan and Hompesch to assemble twenty battalions and seventeen squadrons, from Douay and the neighbouring garrisons, and march to Arleux, where they should endeavour to pass the Sanset. Brigadier Sutton was detached with the artillery and pontoons to lay bridges over the canal near Goulezen, and over the Scarpe at Vitry, while the duke with the whole confederate army began his march for the same place about nine in the evening. He proceeded with such expedition, that by five in the morning he passed the river at Vitry. There he received intelligence, that Hompesch had taken possession of the passes on the Sanset and Schelde without opposition, the enemy having withdrawn their detachments from that side, just as he had imagined. He himself with his van∣guard of fifty squadrons, hastened his march towards Arleux, and before eight of the clock arrived at Bacá-Bacheul, where in two hours he was joined by the heads of the columns into which he had divided his infantry. Villars being certified of his intention, about two in the morning decamped with his whole army, and putting himself at the head of the king's houshold troops, marched all night with such expedition, that about eleven in the forenoon he was in sight of the duke of Marlborough, who had by this time joined count Hompesch. The French general immediately retreated to the main body of his army, which had advanced to the high-road between Arras and Cambray, while the allies encamped upon the Schelde between O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sy and Estrun, after a march of ten
<PB N="382" REF="3850"/>
leagues without halting, scarce to be paralleled in history. By this plan, so happily executed, the duke of Marlborough fairly outwitted Villars, and, without the loss of one man<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> entered the lines which he had pronounced im∣penetrable. This stroke of the English general was extolled as a master-piece of military skill, while Villars was exposed to the ridicule even of his own of∣ficers. The field-deputies of the states-general proposed that he should give battle to the enemy, who passed the Schelde at Crevecoeur, in order to cover Bouchain: but the duke would not hazard an engagement, considering how much the army was fatigued by the long march; and that any misfortune, while they continued within the French lines, might be fatal. His intention was to besiege Bouchain, an enterprize that was deemed impracticable, inasmuch as the place was situated in a mora<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> strongly fortified, and defended by a nu∣merous garrison, in the neighbourhood of an army superior in number to that of the allies. Notwithstanding these disadvantages, and the dissuasions of his own friends, he resolved to undertake the siege; and, in the mean time, dis∣patched brigadier Sutton to England, with an account of his having passed the French lines; which was not all agreeable to his enemies. They had prog∣nosticated that nothing would be done during this campaign, and began to in∣sinuate that the duke could strike no stroke of importance without the assist∣ance of prince Eugene. They now endeavoured to lessen the glory of his suc∣cess; and even taxed him with having removed his camp from a convenient situation to a place where the troops were in danger of starving. Nothing could be more provoking than this scandalous malevolence, to a great man who had done so much honour to his country, and was then actually exposing his life in her service.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>On the tenth day of August Bouchain was invested, and the duke of Marlborough exerted himself to the utmost extent of his vigilance and capacity, well knowing the difficulties of the undertaking, and how much his reputation would depend upon his success. Villars had taken every precaution that his skill and experience could suggest, to baffle the endeavours of the English general. He had reinforced the garrison to the number of six thou∣sand chosen men, commanded by officers of known courage and ability. He made some efforts to raise the siege; but they were rendered ineffectual by the consummate prudence and activity of the duke of Marlborough. Then he layed a scheme for surprising Doway, which likewise miscarried. If we consider that the English general, in the execution of his plan, was obliged to form lines, erect regular forts, raise batteries, throw bridges over a river, make a cause∣way through a deep morass, provide for the security of convoys against a nu∣merous army on one side, and the garrisons of Condé and Valenciennes on the other; we must allow this was the boldest enterprize of the whole war; that it required all the fortitude, skill, and resolution, of a great general, and all the valour and intrepidity of the confederate troops, who had scarce ever exhibited such amazing proofs of courage upon any other occasion, as they now dis∣played at the siege of Bouchain. In twenty days after the trenches were opened, the garrison was obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war; and this conquest was the last military exploit performed by the duke of Marlborough: for the breaches of Bouchain were no sooner repaired, than the opposite armies began to separate, and the allied forces were quartered in the frontier towns, that they might be at hand to take the field early in the spring.
<PB N="383" REF="3860"/>
They were now in possession of the Maese, almost as far as the Sambre; of the Schelde from Tournay, and of the Lys as far as it is navigable. They had reduced Spanish Guelderland, Limburg, Brabant, Flanders, and the greater part of Hainault: they were masters of the Scarpe; and, by the con∣quest of Bouchain, they had opened to themselves a way into the very bowels of France. All these acquisitions were owing to the valour and conduct of the duke of Marlborough, who now returned to the Hague, and arrived in Eng∣land about the middle of November.</P>

<P>The queen had conferred the command of her forces in Spain upon the duke of Argyle, who was recalled from the service in Flanders for that purpose. He had long been at variance with the duke of Marlborough; a circumstance which recommended him the more strongly to the ministry. He landed at Barcelona on the twenty-ninth of May, and found the British troops in the utmost distress for want of subsistence. The treasurer had pro∣mised to supply him liberally; the commons had granted one million, five hun∣dred thousand pounds for that service. All their hopes of success were fixed on the campaign in that kingdom; and indeed the army commanded by the duke of Vendome was in such a wretched condition, that if Staremberg had been properly supported by the allies, he might have obtained signal advantages. The duke of Argyle having waited in vain for the promised remittances, was obliged to borrow money on his own credit, before the British troops could take the field. At length Staremberg advanced towards the enemy, who attacked him at the pass of Prato del Rey, where they were repulsed with considerable da∣mage. After this action the duke of Argyle was seized with a violent fever, and conveyed back to Barcelona. Vendome invested the castle of Cardona, which was vigorously defended till the end of December, when a detachment being sent to the relief of the place, defeated the besiegers, killed two thou∣sand on the spot, and took all their artillery, ammunition, and baggage. Staremberg was unable to follow the blow: the duke of Argyle wrote pressing letters to the ministry, and loudly complained that he was altogether unsup∣ported; but all his remonstrances were ineffectual: no remittances arrived<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he returned to England without having been able to attempt any thing of importance. In September, king Charles leaving his queen at Barcelona, set <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ail for Italy, and at Milan had an interview with the duke of Savoy, where all disputes were compromised. That prince had forced his way into Savoy, and penetrated as far as the Rhine: but he suddenly halted in the middle of his career, and after a short campaign repassed the mountains. Prince Eugene, at the head of the German forces, protected the electors at Frankfort from the designs of the enemy, and Charles was unanimously chosen emperor; the electors of Cologne and Bavaria having been excluded from voting, because they lay under the ban of the empire. The war between the Ottoman Porte and the Muscovites was of short duration. The czar advanced so far into Moldavia, that he was cut off from all supplies, and altogether in the power of his enemy. In this emergency, he found means to corrupt the grand vizir in private, while in public he proposed articles of peace that were accepted. The king of Sweden, who was in the Turkish army, charged the vizir with treachery, and that minister was actually disgraced. The grand signor threat∣ened to renew the war; but he was appeased by the czar's surrendering A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oph.</P>

<P>The English ministry had conceived great expectations from an expedition against Quebec and Placentia, in North America, planned by colonel Nicholson, who had taken possession of Nova Scotia, and garrisoned Port-royal, to which he gave the name of Annapolis. He had brought four Indian chiefs to England, and represented the advantages that would redound to the nation, in point of commerce, should the French be expelled from North America. The ministers relished the proposal. A body of five thousand men were embarked in transports, under the command of brigadier Hill, brother to Mrs. Masham; and they sailed from Plymouth in the beginning of May, with a strong squa∣dron of ships commanded by Sir Hovenden Walker. At Boston in New Eng∣land, they were joined by two regiments of provincials; and about four thou∣sand men, consisting of American planters, Palatines, and Indians, rendez∣voused at Albany, in order to march by land into Canada, while the fleet sailed up the river of that name. On the twenty-first day of August, they were exposed to a violent storm, and driven among rocks, where eight trans∣ports perished with about eight hundred men. The admiral immediately sailed back to Spanish-River bay, where it was determined in a council of war, that as the fleet and forces were victualled for ten weeks only, and they could not depend upon a supply of provisions from New-England, they should return home, without making any further attempt. Such was the issue of this paultry expedition, intrusted to the direction of an officer without talents and ex∣perience.</P>

<P>In the Irish parliament held during the summer, the duke of Or∣mond and the majority of the peers supported the Tory-interest, while the commons expressed the warmest attachment to revolution-principles. The two houses made strenuous representations, and passed severe resolutions against each other. After the session, Sir Constantine Phipps the chancellor, and ge∣neral Ingold<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>by, were appointed justices in the absence of the duke of Ormond, who returned to England in the month of November. In Scotland the Ja∣cobites made no scruple of professing their principles and attachments to the pretender. The dutchess of Gordon presented the faculty of advocates with a silver medal representing the chevalier de St. George; and on the reverse the British islands, with the motto "Redditte." After some debate, it was voted, by a majority of sixty-three voices against twelve, that the dutchess should be thanked for this token of her regard. This task was performed by Dundass of Arnistoun, who thanked her grace for having presented them with a medal of their sovereign lord the king; hoping, and being confident, that her grace would very soon have an opportunity to compliment the faculty with a second medal, struck upon the restoration of the king and royal family, and the finishing rebellion, usurping tyranny and whiggery. An account of this transaction being layed before the queen, the lord-advocate was ordered to inquire into the particulars. Then the faculty were so intimidated, that they disowned Dundass, and Horne his accomplice. They pretended that the affair of the medal had been transacted by a party at an occasional meet∣ing, and not by general consent; and, by a solemn act, they declared their at∣tachment to the queen and the protestant succession. The court was satisfied with this atonement; but the resident from Hanover having presented a memo∣rial to the queen, desiring that Dundass and his associates might be prosecuted,
<PB N="385" REF="3880"/>
the government removed Sir David Dalrymple from his office of lord-advo∣cate, on pretence of his having been too remiss in prosecuting those delin∣quents; and no further inquiry was made into the affair.</P>

<P>For some time a negotiation for peace had been carried on be∣tween the court of France and the new ministers, who had a double aim in this measure; namely, to mortify the Whigs and the Dutch, whom they de∣tested, and to free their country from a ruinous war, which had all the ap∣pearance of becoming habitual to the constitution. They foresaw the risque they would run by entering into such measures, should ever the opposite faction regain the ascendency: they knew the Whigs would employ all their art and influence, which was very powerful, in obstructing the peace, and in raising a popular clamour against the treaty. But their motives for treating were such as prompted them to undervalue all those difficulties and dangers. They hoped to obtain such advantages in point of commerce, for the subjects of Great Britain, as would silence all detraction. They did not doubt of being able to maintain the superiority which they had acquired in parliament; and perhaps some of them cherished views in favour of the pretender, whose suc∣cession to the crown would have effectually established their dominion over the opposite party. The earl of Jersey, who acted in concert with Oxford, sent a private message to the court of France, importing the queen's earnest desire of peace, representing the impossibility of a private negotiation, as the ministry was obliged to act with the utmost circumspection; and desiring that Lewis would propose to the Dutch a renewal of the conferences, in which case the English plenipotentiaries should have such instructions, that it would be impossible for the states-general to prevent the conclusion of the treaty. This intimation was delivered by one Gualtier, an obscure priest, who acted as chaplain to count Gallas the Imperial ambassador, and had been employed as a spy by the French ministry, since the commencement of hostilities. His connexion with lord Jersey was by means of his lady, who professed the roman catholic re∣ligion. His message was extremely agreeable to the court of St. Germain's; and he returned to London with a letter of compliment from the marquis de Torcy to the earl of Jersey, in which that minister assured him of his master's sincere inclination for peace, though he was averse to a renewal of the con∣ferences with the states-general. Gualtier wrote a letter to Versailles, desiring, in the name of the English ministry, that his most christian majesty would communicate to them his proposals for a general peace, which they would com∣municate to the states-general, that they might negotiate in concert with their allies. A general answer being made to this intimation, Gualtier made a second journey to Versailles, and brought over a memorial, which was immediately transmitted to Holland. In the mean time, the pensionary endeavoured to re∣new the conferences in Holland. Petkum wrote to the French ministry, that if his majesty would resume the negotiation, in concert with the queen of Great Britain, he should certainly have reason to be satisfied with the con∣duct of the Dutch deputies. This proposal Lewis declined, at the desire of the English ministers.</P>

She likewise insisted upon a security that the crowns of France and Spain should never be united on the same head. Her majesty no longer insisted upon Philip's being expelled from the throne of Spain by the arms of his own grandfather. She now perceived that the exorbitant power of the house of Austria would be as dangerous to the liberty of Europe, as ever that of the family of Bourbon had been in the zenith of its glory. She might have remembered the excessive power, the insolence, the ambition, of Charles V. and Philip II. who had enslaved so many countries, and embroiled all Europe. She was sincerely desirous of peace, from motives of humanity and compassion to her subjects and fellow-creatures: she was eagerly bent upon procuring such advantages to her people, as would enable them to discharge the heavy load of debt under which they laboured, and recompence them in some measure for the blood and treasure they had so lavishly expended in the prosecution of the war. These were the sentiments of a christian princess; of an amiable and pious sovereign<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who bore a share in the grievances of her subjects, and looked upon them with the eyes of maternal affection. She thought she had the bet∣ter title to insist upon those advantages, as they had been already granted to her subjects in a private treaty with king Charles.</P>

<P>As Prior's powers were limited in such a manner that he could not negotiate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Menager, deputy from the city of Rouen to the board of trade, accompanied the English minister to London, with full powers to settle the preliminaries of the treaty. At his arrival in London, the queen immediately commissioned the duke of Shrewsbury, the earls of Jersey, Dartmouth, Ox∣ford,
<PB N="387" REF="3900"/>
and Mr. St. John, to treat with him; and the conferences were imme∣diately begun. After long and various disputes, they agreed upon certain pre∣liminary articles, which, on the eighth day of October, were signed by the French minister, and by the two secretaries of state, in consequence of a written order from her majesty. Then Menager was privately introduced to the queen at Windsor. She told him she was averse to war: that she would exert all her power to conclude a speedy peace: that she should be glad to live upon good terms with the king of France, to whom she was so nearly allied in blood; and she expressed her hope that there would be a closer union after the peace, between them, and between their subjects, cemented by a perfect correspondence and friendship. The earl of Strafford, who had been lately recalled from the Hague, where he resided as ambassador, was now sent back to Holland, with orders to communicate to the pensionary the proposals of peace which France had made; to signify the queen's approbation of them, and propose a place where the plenipotentiaries should assemble. The English ministers now en∣gaged in an intimate correspondence with the court of Versailles; and marechal Tallard being released from his confinement at Nottingham, was allowed to return to his own country on his parole. After the departure of Menager, the preliminaries were communicated to count Gallas, the emperor's minister, who, in order to inflame the minds of the people, caused them to be tran∣slated and inserted in one of the daily papers. This step was so much resented by the queen, that she sent a message, desiring he would come no more to court; but that he might leave the kingdom as soon as he should think proper. He took the hint, and retired accordingly; but the queen gave the emperor to un∣derstand, that any other minister he should appoint, would be admitted by her without hesitation.</P>

<P>The states of Holland, alarmed at the preliminaries, sent over Buys as envoy extraordinary, to intercede with the queen that she would alter her resolutions: but she continued steady to her purpose; and the earl of Straf∣ford demanded the immediate concurrence of the states, declaring, in the queen's name, that she would look upon any delay, on their part, as a refusal to comply with her propositions. Intimidated by this declaration, they agreed to open the general conferences at Utrecht on the first day of January. They granted passports to the French ministers; and the queen appointed Robinson bishop of Bristol, and the earl of Strafford, her plenipotentiaries at the congress. Charles, the new emperor, being at Milan when he received a copy of the pre∣liminaries, wrote circular letters to the electors and princes of the empire, ex∣horting them to persist in their engagements to the grand alliance. He like∣wise desired the states-general to join counsels with him in persuading the queen of England to reject the proposals of France, and prosecute the war; or at least negotiate on the foundation of the first preliminaries, which had been signed by the marquis de Torcy. He wrote a letter to the same purpose to the queen of Great Britain, who received it with the most mortifying indif∣ference. No wonder that he should zealously contend for the continuance of a war, the expence of which she and the Dutch had hitherto almost wholly de∣frayed. The new preliminaries were severely attacked by the Whigs, who ri∣diculed and reviled the ministry in word and writing. Pamphlets, libels, and lampoons, were to-day published by one faction, and to-morrow answered by
<PB N="388" REF="3910"/>
the other. They contained all the insinuations of malice and contempt, all the b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tterne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of reproach, and all the rancour of recrimination. In the midst of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> contention, the queen dispatched the earl of Rivers to Hanover, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n assurance to the elector, that his succession to the crown should be effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>certained in the treaty. The earl brought back an answer in writing: but, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same time, his electoral highness ordered the baron de Bothmar, his en∣voy an England, to present a memorial to the queen, representing the perni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous consequences of Philip's remaining in possession of Spain and the West Indies. This remonstrance the baron published by way of appeal to the people, and the Whigs extolled it with the highest encomiums, while the queen and her ministers resented this step, as an officious and inflammatory inter∣position.</P>

<P>The proposals of peace made by the French king were dis∣agreeable even to some individuals of the Tory-party, and certain peers who had hitherto adhered to that interest, agreed with the Whigs, to make a re∣monstrance against the preliminary articles. The court being apprised of their intention, prorogued the parliament till the seventh day of December, in ex∣pectation of the Scottish peers, who would cast the balance in favour of the mi∣nistry. In her speech, at the opening of the session, she told them that, not∣withstanding the arts of those who delighted in war, the place and time were appointed for a congress; and that the states-general had expressed their entire confidence in her conduct. She declared her chief concern should be to secure the succession of the crown in the house of Hanover; to procure all the advan∣tages to the nation which a tender and affectionate sovereign could procure for a dutiful and loyal people; and to obtain satisfaction for all her allies. She observed, that the most effectual way to procure an advantageous peace, would be to make preparations for carrying on the war with vigour. She recom∣mended unanimity, and prayed God would direct their consultations. In the house of lords, the earl of Nottingham, who had now associated himself with the Whigs, inveighed against the preliminaries as captious and insufficient, and offered a clause to be inserted in the address of thanks, representing to her ma∣jesty, that in the opinion of the house, no peace could be safe or honourable to Great Britain or Europe, if Spain and the West Indies should be allotted to any branch of the house of Bourbon. A violent debate ensued, in the course of which the earl of Anglesey re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esented the necessity of easing the nation of the burdens incurred by an expensive war. He affirmed, that a good peace might have been procured immediately after the battle of Ramillies, if it had not been prevented by some persons who prolonged the war for their own pri∣vate interest. This insinuation was levelled at the duke of Marlborough, who made a long speech in his own vindication. He bowed to the place where the queen sat incognito; and appealed to her, whether, while he had the honour to serve her majesty as general and plenipotentiary, he had not constantly informed her and her council of all the proposals of peace which had been made; and had not desired instructions for his conduct on that sub∣ject? He declared, upon his conscience, and in presence of the supreme Being, be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore whom he expected soon to appear, that he was ever desirous of a safe, honourable, and lasting peace; and that he was always very far from enter∣taining any design of prolonging the war for his own private advantage, as
<PB N="389" REF="3920"/>
his enemies had most falsely insinuated. At last the question being put, Whether the earl of Nottingham's advice should be part of the address? it was carried in the affirmative by a small majority. The address was accordingly presented; and the queen, in her answer, said she should be very sorry any one could think she would not do her utmost to recover Spain and the West Indies from the house of Bourbon. Against this advice, however, several peers protested, because there was no precedent for inserting a clause of advice in an address of thanks; and because they looked upon it as an invasion of the royal prerogative. In the ad∣dress of the commons there was no such article; and therefore the answer they received was warm and cordial.</P>

<P>The duke of Hamilton claiming a seat in the house of peers, as duke of Brandon, a title he had lately received, was opposed by the anti∣courtiers, who pretended to foresee great danger to the constitution from ad∣mitting into the house a greater number of Scottish peers than the act of union allowed. Counsel was heard upon the validity of his patent. They observed that no objection could be made to the queen's prerogative in conferring ho∣nours; and that all the subjects of the united kingdom were equally capable of receiving honour. The house of lords had already decided the matter, in admitting the duke of Queensberry upon his being created duke of Dover. The debate was managed with great ability on both sides: the Scottish peers united in defence of the duke's claim; and the court exerted its whole strength to support the patent. Nevertheless, the question being put, Whether Scottish peers, created peers of Great Britain since the union, had a right to sit in that house? it was carried in the negative by a majority of five voices; though not without a protest signed by the lords in the opposition. The Scottish peers were so incensed at this decision, that they drew up a representation to the queen, complaining of it as an infringement of the union, and a mark of dis∣grace put upon the whole peerage of Scotland. The bill against occasional conformity was revived by the earl of Nottingham, in more moderate terms than those that had been formerly rejected; and it passed both houses by the connivance of the Whigs, upon the earl's promise that if they would consent to this measure, he would bring over many friends to join them in matters of greater consequence. On the twenty-second day of December, the queen being indisposed, granted a commission to the lord-keeper, and some other peers, to give the royal assent to this bill, and another for the land-tax. The duke of Devonshire obtained leave to bring in a bill for giving precedence of all peers to the electoral prince of Hanover, as duke of Cambridge. An ad∣dress was presented to the queen, desiring she would give instructions to her plenipotentiaries, to consult with the ministers of the allies in Holland before the opening of the congress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that they might concert the necessary measures for proceeding with unanimity, the better to obtain the great ends proposed by her majesty.</P>

Nevertheless, he was treated with that respect which was due to his quality and eminent talents. The ministers, the nobility, and officers of cistinction, visited him at his arrival. He was admitted to an audience of the queen, who received him with great compla∣cency. Having perused the letter which he delivered, she expressed her con∣cern that her health did not permit her to speak with his highness as often as she could wish; but that she had ordered the treasurer and secretary St. John to receive his proposals, and confer with him as frequently as he should think proper. He expressed extraordinary respect for the duke of Marlborough, not∣withstanding his disgrace. The lord-treasurer, while he entertained him at dinner, declared, that he looked upon that day as the happiest in the whole course of his life, since he had the honour to see in his house the greatest captain of the age. The prince is said to have replied, <Q>“If I am, it is owing to your lords<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ip.”</Q> Alluding to the disgrace of Marlborough, whom the earl's in∣trigues had deprived of all military command.

he had been once fortunate, the prince observed it was the greatest com∣mendation that could be bestowed upon him, as it implied that all his other successes were owing to his courage and conduct. While the nobility of both parties vied with each other in demonstrations of respect for this noble stran∣ger; while he was adored by the Whigs, and admired by the people, who gazed at him in crowds when he appeared in public; even in the midst of all these caresses, party-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ots were excited to insult his person, and some scandalous reslections upon his mother were inserted in one of the public papers. The queen treated him with distinguished marks of regard; and, on her birth-day, presented him with a sword worth five thousand pounds. Nevertheless, she looked upon him as a patron and friend of that turbulent faction to which she owed so much disquiet. She knew he had been pressed to come over by the Whig-noblemen, who hoped his presence would inflame the people to some d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rate attempt upon the new ministry: she was not ignorant that he held private conferences with the duke of Marlborough, the earl of Sunderland, the lords Somers, Hallifax, and all the chiefs of that party, and entered into a close connection with the baron de Bothmar the Hanoverian envoy, who had been very active in fome<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting the disturbances of the people.</P>

<P>Her majesty, who had been for some time a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>licted with the gout, sent a message to both houses, on the seventeenth day of January, signifying that the plenipotentiaries were arrived at Utrecht; and that she was employed in making preparations for an early campaign: she hoped therefore that the commons would proceed in giving the necessary dispatch to the supplies. The lord treasurer, in order to demonstrate his attachment to the protestant suc∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssion, brought in a bill which had been proposed by the duke of Devon∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, giving precedence to the whole electoral family, as children and nephews of the crown; and, when it was passed into an act, he sent it over to Hanover by Mr. Thomas Harley.

The commons finding Mr. Walpole very troubl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>some in their house, by his talents, activity, and zealous attachment to the Whig interest, found means to discover some clandestine practices in which he was concerned as secretary at war, with regard to the forage-contract in Scotland.

It was alledged, in his justification, that the present from the Jews was a customary perquisite, which had always been enjoyed by the general of the Dutch army: that the deduction of two and a half per cent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was granted to him by an express warrant from her majesty: that all the articles of the charge joined together did not ex∣ceed thirty thousand pounds, a sum much inferior to that which had been al∣lowed to king William for contingencies: that the money was expended in procuring intelligence, which was so exact that the duke was never surprised: that none of his parties were ever intercepted or cut off; and all his designs were by these means so well concerted, that he never once miscarried. Not∣withstanding these representations, the majority voted that his practices had been unwarrantable and illegal; and that the deduction was to be accounted for as public money. These resolutions were communicated to the queen, who ordered the attorney-general to prosecute the duke for the money he had de∣ducted, by virtue of her own warrant. Such practices were certainly mean and mercenary, and greatly tarnished the glory which the duke had acquired by his military talents, and other shining qualities.</P>

<P>The commons now directed the stream of their resentment against the Dutch, who had certainly exerted all their endeavours to overwhelm the new ministry, and retard the negotiations for peace. They maintained an inti∣mate correspondence with the Whigs of England. They diffused the most in∣vidious reports against Oxford and secretary St. John. Buys their envoy at London, acted the part of an incendiary, in suggesting violent measures to the malcontents, and caballing against the government. The ministers, by way of reprizal, influenced the house of commons to pass some acrimonious resolutions against the states-general. They alledged that the states had been deficient in their proportion of troops, both in Spain and in the Netherlands, during the whole course of the war; and that the queen had payed above three millions of crowns in subsidies, above what she was obliged to advance by her engagements. They attacked the barrier treaty, which had been concluded with the states by lord Townshend, after the conferences at Gertruydenberg. By this agreement, England guaranteed a barrier in the Netherlands to the Dutch; and the states bound themselves to maintain, with their whole force, the queen's title and the protestant succession. The Tories affirmed that Eng∣land was disgraced, by engaging any other state to defend a succession which the nation might see cause to alter: that, by this treaty, the states were autho∣rised to interpose in British councils: that being possessed of all those strong towns, they might exclude the English from trading to them, and interfere with the manufactures of Great Britain. The house of commons voted, That in the barrier treaty there were several articles destructive to the trade and in∣terest of Great Britain; and therefore highly dishonourable to her majesty: That the lord viscount Townshend was not authorized to conclude several ar∣ticles in that treaty: and, That he and all those who advised its being ratified, were enemies to the queen and kingdom. All their votes were digested into a long representation presented to the queen, in which they averred that England, during the war, had been overcharged nineteen millions; a circumstance that
<PB N="393" REF="3960"/>
implied mismanagement or fraud in the old ministry. The states, alarmed at these resolutions, wrote a respectful letter to the queen, representing the necessity of a barrier, for the mutual security of England and the United Provinces. They afterwards drew up a large memorial in vindication of their proceedings during the war, and it was published in one of the English papers. The com∣mons immediately voted it a false, scandalous, and malicious libel, reflecting upon the resolutions of the house; and the printer and publisher were taken into custody, as guilty of a breach of privilege.</P>

The house, notwithstanding this remonstrance, proceeded with the bill, and in∣serted a clause prohibiting civil magistrates from executing the sentences of the kirk-judicatories. The episcopal, as well as the presbyterian clergy, were required to take the oath of abjuration, that they might be upon an equal foot∣ing in case of disobedience; for the commons well knew that this condition would be rejected by both, from very different motives. In order to exasperate the presbyterians with further provocations, another act was passed for dis∣continuing the courts of judicature during the Christmas holidays, which had never been kept by persons of that persuasion. When this bill was read for the third time, Sir David Dalrymple said, <Q>“Since the house is resolved to make no alteration in the body of this bill, I acquiesce; and only desire it may be intituled, A bill for establishing jacobitism and immorality.”</Q> The chagrin of the Scottish presbyterians was completed by a third bill, re∣storing the right of patronage, which had been taken away when the discipline of the kirk was last established. Prince Eugene having presented a memorial to the queen, touching the conduct of the emperor during the war, and con∣taining a proposal with relation to the affairs of Spain, the queen communi∣cated the scheme to the house of commons, who treated it with the most con∣temptuous neglect. The prince finding all his efforts ineffectual, retired to the continent, as much displeased with the ministry, as he had reason to be satisfied with the people of England.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month of January the conferences for peace began at Utrecht. The earl of Jersey would have been appointed plenipotentiary for England, but he dying after the correspondence with the court of France was established, the queen con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erred that charge upon Robinson bishop of Bristol,
<PB N="395" REF="3980"/>
lord privy-seal, and the earl of Strafford. The chief of the Dutch deputies named for the congress, were Buys and Vanderdussen; and the French king granted his powers to the marechal D'Uxelles, the abbot (afterwards cardinal) de Polignac, and Menager, who had been in England. The ministers of the emperor and Savoy likewise assisted at the conferences, to which the empire and the other allies likewise sent their plenipotentiaries, though not without reluc∣tance. As all those powers, except France, entertained sentiments very differ∣ent from those of her Britannic majesty, the conferences seemed calculated ra∣ther to retard than accelerate a pacification. The queen of England had fore∣seen and provided against these difficulties. Her great end was to free her sub∣jects from the miseries attending an unprofitable war, and to restore peace to Europe; and this aim she was resolved to accomplish, in spite of all opposition. She had also determined to procure reasonable terms of accommodation for her allies, without, however, continuing to lavish the blood and treasure of her people in supporting their extravagant demands. The emperor obstinately insisted upon his claim to the whole Sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nish monarchy, refusing to give up the least tittle of his pretensions; and the Dutch adhered to the old prelimina∣ries which Lewis had formerly rejected. The queen saw, that the liberties of Europe would be exposed to much greater danger from an actual union of the Imperial and Spanish crowns in one head of the house of Austria, than from a bare possibility of Spain's being united with France in one branch of the house of Bourbon. She knew by experience the difficulty of dethroning Philip, rooted as he was in the affections of a brave and loyal people; and, that a prose∣cution of this design would serve no purpose but to protract the war, and aug∣ment the grievances of the British nation. She was well acquainted with the distresses of the French, which she considered as pledges of their monarch's sin∣cerity. She sought not the total ruin of that people, already reduced to the brink of despair. The dictates of true policy dissuaded her from contribut∣ing to further conquests in that kingdom, which would have proved the source of contention among the allies, depressed the house of Bourbon below that stand∣ard of importance which the ballance of Europe required it should maintain, and aggrandize the states-general at the expence of Great-Britain. As she had borne the chief burden of the war, she had a right to take the lead; and dic∣tate a plan of pacification: at least, she had a right to consult the welfare of her own kingdom, in delivering, by a separate peace, her subjects from those enor∣mous loads which they could no longer sustain; and she was well enough aware of her own consequence, to think she could obtain advantageous conditions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>Such were the sentiments of the queen: and her ministers seem to have acted on the same principles, though, perhaps, party-motives may have helped to influence their conduct. The allies concurred in opposing with all their might any treaty which could not gratify their different views of avarice, in∣terest, and ambition. They practised a thousand little artifices to intimidate the queen, to excite a jealousy of Lewis, to blacken the characters of her mi∣nisters, to raise and keep up a dangerous ferment among her people, by which her life and government were endangered. She could not fail to resent these efforts, which greatly perplexed her measures and obstructed her design. Her ministers were sensible of the dangerous predicament in which they stood. The
<PB N="396" REF="3990"/>
queen's health was much impaired; and the successor countenanced the opposite faction. In case of their sovereign's death they had nothing to expect but pro∣secution and ruin for obeying her commands; and they saw no hope of safety except in renouncing their principles, and submitting to their adversaries, or else in taking such measures as would hasten the pacification, that the troubles of the kingdom might be appeased, and the people be satisfied with their conduct before death should deprive them of their sovereign's protection. With this view they advised her to set on foot a private negotiation with Lewis; to stipulate cer∣tain advantages for her own subjects in a concerted plan of peace; to enter into such mutual confidence with that monarch, as would anticipate all clandestine transactions to her prejudice, and in some measure enable her to prescribe terms for her allies. The plan was judiciously formed, but executed with too much precipitation. The stipulated advantages were not such as she had a right to demand and insist upon; and, without all doubt, better might have been ob∣tained, had not the obstinacy of the allies abroad, and the violent conduct of the Whig faction at home, obliged the ministers to relax in some material points, and hasten the conclusion of the treaty.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The articles being privately regulated between the two courts of Lon∣don and Versailles, the English plenipotentiaries at Utrecht were furnished with general powers and instructions, being ignorant of the agreement which the queen had made with the French monarch touching the kingdom of Spain, which was indeed the basis of the treaty. This secret plan of negotiation, how∣ever, had well nigh been destroyed by some unforeseen events that were doubly afflicting to Lewis. The dauphin had died of the small pox in the course of the preceding year, and his title had been conferred upon his son the duke of Bur∣gundy, who now expired on the last day of February, six days after the death of his wife, Mary Adelaide of Savoy. The parents were soon followed to the grave by their eldest offspring the duke of Brittany, in the sixth year of his age; so that of the duke of Burgundy's children, none remained alive but the duke of Anjou, the present French king, who was at that time a sickly infant. Such a series of calamities could not fail of being extremely shocking to Lewis in his old age; but they were still more alarming to the queen of England, who saw that nothing but the precarious life of an unhealthy child divided the two mo∣narchies of France and Spain, the union of which she resolved by all possible means to prevent. She therefore sent the abbé Gualtier to Paris, with a me∣morial, representing the danger to which the liberty of Europe would be ex∣posed should Philip ascend the throne of France; and demanding, that his title should be transferred to his brother the duke of Berry, in consequence of his pure, simple, and voluntary renunciation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while the French plenipotentiares at Utrecht were prevailed upon to deliver their proposals in writing, under the name of specific offers, which the allies received with indignation. They were treated in England with uni∣versal scorn. Lord Hallifax, in the house of peers, termed them trifling, arro∣gant, and injurious to her majesty and her allies: an address was presented to the queen, in which they expressed their resentment against the insolence of France, and promised to assist her with all their power in prosecuting the war, until a safe and honourable peace should be obtained. The plenipotentiaries of the allies were not less extravagant in their specific demands, than the French
<PB N="397" REF="4000"/>
had been arrogant in their offers. In a word, the ministers seemed to have been assembled at Utrecht, rather to start new difficulties and widen the breach, than to heal animosities, and concert a plan of pacification. They amused one an∣other with fruitless conferences, while the queen of Great Britain endeavoured to engage the states-general in her measures, that they might treat with France upon moderate terms, and give law to the rest of the allies. She departed from some of her own pretensions, in order to gratify them with the possession of some towns in Flanders. She consented to their being admitted into a participation of some advantages in commerce; and ordered the English ministers at the con∣gress to tell them, that she would take her measures according to the return they should make on this occasion. Finding them still obstinately attached to their first chimerical preliminaries, she gave them to understand, that all her offers for adjusting the differences were founded upon the express condition, That they should come into her measures, and co-operate with her openly and sin∣cerely; but they had made such bad returns to all her condescension towards them, that she looked upon herself as released from all engagements. The mi∣nisters of the allies had insisted upon a written answer to their specific demands; and this the French plenipotentiaries declined, until they should receive fresh instructions from their master. Such was the pretence for suspending the con∣ferences; but the real bar to a final agreement between England and France, was the delay of Philip's renunciation, which, at length, however, arrived; and produced a cessation of arms.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>In the mean time the duke of Ormond, who was now invested with the supreme command of the British forces, received a particular order, that he should not hazard an engagement. Lewis had already undertaken for the com∣pliance of his grandson. Reflecting on his own great age, he was shocked at the prospect of leaving his kingdom involved in a pernicious war during a mi∣nority; and determined to procure a peace at all events. The queen, know∣ing his motives, could not help believing his protestations, and resolved to avoid a battle, the issue of which might have considerably altered the situation of affairs, and consequently retarded the conclusion of the treaty. Preparations had been made for an early campaign. In the beginning of March the earl of Albemarle having assembled a body of thirty-six battalions, marched towards Arras, which he reduced to an heap of ashes by a most terrible cannonading and bombardment. In May the duke of Ormond conferred with the deputies of the states-general at the Hague, and assured them he had orders to act vigo∣rously in the prosecution of the war. He joined prince Eugene at Tournay; and on the twenty-sixth day of May the allied army passing the Schelde, en∣camped at Haspre and Solemnes. The Imperial general proposed, that they should attack the French army under Villars; but by this time the duke was restrained from hazarding siege or battle: a circumstance well known to the French commander, who therefore abated of his usual vigilance. It could not be long concealed from prince Eugene and the deputies, who forthwith dispatched an express to their principals on this subject, and afterwards presented a long memorial to the duke, representing the injury which the grand alliance would sustain from his obedience to such an order. He seemed to be extremely uneasy at his situation; and, in a letter to secretary St. John, expressed a desire that the queen would permit him to return to England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<PB N="398" REF="4010"/>
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>Prince Eugene, notwithstanding the queen's order, which Ormond had not yet formally declared, invested the town of Quesnoy, and the duke fur∣nished towards this enterprize seven battalions and nine squadrons of the foreign troops maintained by Great-Britain. The Dutch deputies at Utrecht expostu∣lating with the bishop of Bristol upon the duke's refusing to act against the ene∣my, that prelate told them, that he had lately received an express with a letter from her majesty, in which she complained, that as the states-general had not properly answered her advances, they ought not to be surprised, if she thought herself at liberty to enter into separate measures, in order to obtain a peace for her own conveniency. When they remonstrated against such conduct, as con∣tradictory to all the alliances subsisting between the queen and the states general, the bishop declared his instructions further imported, that considering the conduct of the states towards her majesty, she thought herself disengaged from all alli∣ances and engagements with their high-mightinesses. The states and the mi∣nisters of the allies were instantly in commotion. Private measures were con∣certed with the elector of Hanover, the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and some other princes of the empire, concerning the troops belonging to those powers, in the pay of Great-Britain. The states-general wrote a long letter to the queen, and ordered their envoy at London to deliver it into her own hand. Count Zinzendorf the emperor's plenipotentiary dispatched expresses to his master, to prince Eugene, and to the Imperial ambassador at London. The queen held a council at Kensington upon the subject of the letter; and a fresh order was sent to the duke of Ormond, directing him to concur with the general of the allies in a siege.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>On the twenty-eighth day of May lord Hallifax, in the house of peers, descanted upon the ill consequences of the duke's refusing to co-operate with prince Eugene; and moved for an address, desiring her majesty would order the general to act offensively, in concert with her allies. The treasurer observed it was prudent to avoid a battle on the eve of a peace, especially con∣sidering they had to do with an enemy so apt to break his word. The earl of Wharton replied, this was a strong reason for keeping no measures with s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch an enemy. When Oxford declared, that the duke of Ormond had received orders to join the allies in a siege, the duke of Marlborough affirmed, it was impossi∣ble to carry on a siege without either hazarding a battle, in case the enemy should attempt to relieve the place, or shamefully abandoning the enterprize. The duke of Argyle having declared his opinion, that since the time of Julius Caesar there had not been a greater captain than prince Eugence of Savoy, ob∣served, that considering the different interests of the house of Austria and of Great Britain, it might not consist with prudence to trust him with the manage∣ment of the war, because a battle won or lost might intirely break off a nego∣tiation of peace, which in all probability, was near being concluded. He added, that two years before, the confederates might have taken Arras and Cambray, instead of amusing themselves with the insignificant conquests of Aire, Bethune, and St. Venant. The duke of Devonshire said, he was, by proximity of blood more concerned than any other in the reputation of the duke of Ormond; and therefore could not help expressing his surprize, that any one would dare to make a nobleman of the first rank, and of so distinguished a character, the instrument of such proceedings. Earl Pawlet answered, that no body could
<PB N="399" REF="4020"/>
doubt the duke of Ormond's courage; but he was not like a certain general, who led troops to the slaughter, to cause a great number of officers to be knocked on the head, that he might fill his pockets by disposing of their commissions. The duke of Marlborough was so deeply affected by this reflection, that tho' he suppressed his resentment in the house, he took the first opportunity to send lord Mohun to the earl with a message, importing, that he should be glad to come to an explanation with his lordship about some expressions he had used in that day's debate; and desiring his company to take the air in the country. The earl understood his meaning; but could not conceal his emotion from the observation of his lady, by whose means the affair was communicated to the earl of Dartmouth secretary of state. Two centinels were immediately placed at his lordship's gate; the queen, by the canal of lord Dartmouth, desired the duke of Marlborough would proceed no farther in the quarrel: and he assured her he would punctually obey her majesty's commands. The earl of Oxford assured the house, that a separate peace was never intended: that such a peace would be so base, so knavish, and so villanous, that every one who served the queen knew they must answer it with their heads to the nation; but that it would appear to be a safe and glorious peace, much more to the honour and interest of the nation than the first preliminaries insisted upon by the allies. The question being put for adjourning, the debate was carried in the affirma∣tive; but twenty lords entered a protest. The earl of Strafford, who had re∣turned from Holland, proposed, that they should examine the negotiations of the Hague and Gertruydenberg, before they considered that of Utrecht. He observed, that in the former negotiations the French ministers had conferred only with the pensionary, who communicated no more of it to the ministers of the allies than what was judged proper to let them know: so that the Dutch were absolute masters of the secret. He asserted, that the states-general had consented to give Naples and Sicily to king Philip: a circumstance which proved that the recovery of the whole Spanish monarchy was looked upon as impracticable. He concluded with a motion for an address to her majesty, desiring, that the papers relating to the negotiations of the Hague and Ger∣truydenberg, should be layed before the house. This was carried without a division.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the house of commons Mr. Pulteney moved for an address, ac∣quainting her majesty, that her faithful commons were justly alarmed at the intelli∣gence received from abroad, that her general in Flanders had declined acting offen∣sively against France in concurrence with her allies; and besought her majesty, that he might receive speedy instructions to prosecute the war with the utmost vigour. This motion was rejected by a great majority. A certain member having insinuated, that the present negotiation had been carried on in a clandestine and treacherous manner, Mr. secretary St. John said, he hoped it would not be accounted treachery to act for the good and advantage of Great-Britain: that he gloried in the small share he had in the transaction; and whatever cen∣sure he might undergo for it, the bare satisfaction of acting in that view, would be a sufficient recompence and comfort to him during the whole course of his life. The house resolved, That the commons had an intire confidence in her majesty's promise, to communicate to her parliament the terms of the peace before it should be concluded: and, That they would support her against all such persons either
<PB N="400" REF="4030"/>
at home or abroad as should endeavour to obstruct it. The queen thanked them heartily for this resolution, as being dutiful to her, honest to their country, and very seasonable at a time when so many artifices were used to obstruct a good peace, or to force one disadvantageous to Britain. They likewise pre∣sented an address, desiring, they might have an account of the negotiations and transactions at the Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ue and Gertruydenberg, and know who were then em∣ployed as her majesty's plenipotentiaries.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>The ministry foreseeing, that Philip would not willingly resign his hopes of succee<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the crown of France, proposed an alternative, that, in case of his preferring his expectation of the crown of France to the present possession of Spain, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s kingdom, with the Indies, should be forthwith ceded to the duke of Savoy; and Philip in the mean time should possess the duke's he∣reditary dominions and the kingdom of Si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily, together with the Montferrat and Mantua; all which territories should be annexed to France at Philip's suc∣cession to that crown, except Sicily, which should revert to the house of Au∣stria. Lewis seemed to relish this expedient, which, however, was rejected by Philip, who chose to make the renunciation, rather than quit the throne upon which he was established. The queen demanded, that the renunciation should be ratified in the most solemn manner by the states of France; but she after∣wards waved this demand, in consideration of its being registered in the diffe∣rent parliaments. Such forms are but slender securities against the power, am∣bition, and interest of princes. The marquis de Torcy frankly owned, that Philip's renunciation was in itself void, as being contrary to the fundamental laws and constitution of the French monarchy; but it was found necessary for the satisfaction of the English people. Every material arti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le being now ad∣justed between the two courts, particularly those relating to the king of Spain, the commerce of Great Britain, and the delivery of Dunkirk, a suspension of arms prevailed in the Netherlands, and the duke of Ormond acted in concert with marechal de Villars.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>On the sixth day of June the queen going to the house of peers, com∣municated the plan of peace to her parliament, according to the promise she had made. After having premised, that the making peace and war was the un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oubted prerogative of the crown, and hinted at the difficulties which had ari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en both from the nature of the affair, and numberless obstructions contrived by the enemies of peace, she proceeded to enumerate the chief articles to which both crowns had agreed, without, however, concluding the treaty. She told them she had secured the protestant succession, which France had acknowledged in the strongest terms; and that the pretender would be removed from the French dominions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the duke of Anjou should renounce for himself and his descendants all claim to the crown of France; so that the two monarchies would be for ever divided. She observed, that the nature of this proposal was such as would execute itself: that it would be the interest of Spain to support the renunciation: and in France, the persons entitled to the succession of that crown upon the death of the dauphin, were powerful enough to vindicate their own right. She gave them to understand, that a treaty of commerce between England and France had been begun, though not yet adjusted; but provision was made, that England should enjoy the same privileges that France granted to the most favoured nation: that the French king had agreed to make an absolute cession

of the island of St. Christopher's, which had hitherto been divided between the two nations: that he had also consented to restore the whole bay and straits of Hudson; to deliver the island of Newfoundland, with Placentia; to cede Anna∣polis, with the rest of Acadia or Nova Scotia; to demolish the fortifications of Dunkirk; to leave England in possession of Gibraltar, Port-Mahon, and the whole island of Minorca: that the trade to Spain in the West-Indies might be settled as it was in the reign of his late catholic majesty: and, that she had ob∣tained for her subjects the assiento or contract for furnishing the Spanish West-Indies with negroes for the term of thirty years, in the same manner as it had been enjoyed by the French. With respect to the allies, she declared, that France offered to make the Rhine the barrier of the empire: to yield Brisac, Fort Kehl, and Landau, and raze all the fortresses both on the other side of the Rhine and in the islands of that river: that the protestant interest in Germany would be resettled on the footing of the treaty of Westphalia: that the Spanish Netherlands, the kingdoms of Naples and Sardinia, the dutchy of Milan, and the places belonging to Spain on the coast of Tuscany, might be yielded to his Imperial majesty; but the disposition of Sicily was not yet determined: that the demands of the states-general with relation to commerce and the barrier in the Low Countries, would be granted with a few exceptions, which might be com∣pensated by other expedients: that no great progress had yet been made upon the pretensions of Portugal; but that those of Prussia would be admitted by France without much difficulty: that the difference between the barrier demanded by the duke of Savoy in the year one thousand seven hundred and nine, and that which France now offered, was very inconsiderable: that the elector palatine should maintain his present rank among the electors: and, that France would acknowledge the electoral dignity in the house of Hanover. Such were the con∣ditions which the queen hoped would make some amends to her subjects for the great and unequal burthen they had borne during the whole course of the war. She concluded with saying, she made no doubt but they were fully persuaded, that nothing would be neglected on her part in the progress of this negotiation, to bring the peace to an happy and speedy issue; and she expressed her depen∣dence upon the intire confidence and chearful concurrence of her parlia∣ment.</P>

<P>An address of thanks and approbation was immediately voted, drawn up, and presented to the queen by the commons in a body. When the house of lords took the speech into consideration, the duke of Marlborough asserted, that the measures pursued for a year past were directly contrary to her majesty's en∣gagements with the allies: that they sullied the triumphs and glories of her reign; and would render the English name odious to all nations. The earl of Stra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ord said, that some of the allies would not have shewn such backwardness to a peace, had not they been persuaded and encouraged to carry on the war by a member of that illustrious assembly, who maintained a secret correspondence with them, and fed them with hopes that they would be supported by a strong party in England. In answer to this insinuation against Marlborough, lord Cowper observed, that it could never be suggested as a crime in the meanest subject, much less in any member of that august assembly, to hold correspon∣dence with the allies of the nation; such allies, especially, whose interest her majesty had declared to be inseparable from her own, in her speech at the opening
<PB N="402" REF="4050"/>
of the session; whereas it would be a hard matter to justify and reconcile either with our laws, or with the laws of honour and justice, the conduct of some per∣sons, in treating clandestinely with the common enemy, without the participa∣tion of the allies. This was a frivolous argument. A correspondence with any persons whatsoever becomes criminal, when it tends to foment the divisions of one's country, and arm the people against their sovereign. If England had it not in her power, without infringing the laws of justice and honour, to with∣draw herself from a confederacy which she could no longer support, and treat for peace on her own bottom, then was she not an associate, but a slave to the alliance. The earl of Godolphin affirmed, that the trade to Spain was such a trifle as de∣served no consideration; and that it would continually diminish until it should be intirely engrossed by the French merchants. Notwithstanding these remon∣strances against the plan of peace, the majority agreed to an address, in which they thanked the queen for her extraordinary condescension in communicating those conditions to her parliament; and expressed an intire satisfaction with her conduct. A motion was made for a clause in the address, desiring her majesty would take such measures, in concert with her allies, as might induce them to join with her in a mutual guaranty. A debate ensued: the question was put, and the clause rejected. Several noblemen entered a protest, which was ex∣punged from the books of the house by the decision of the majority.</P>

<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>In the house of commons a complaint was exhibited against bishop Fleetwood, who, in a preface to four sermons which he published, took occasion to extol the last ministry, at the expence of the present administration. This piece was voted malicious and factious, tending to create discord and sedition amongst her majesty's subjects; and condemned to be burned by the hands of the common hangman. They presented an address to the queen, assuring her of the just sense they had of the indignity offered to her, by printing and pub∣lishing a letter from the states-general to her majesty; and desiring she would so far resent such insults as to give no answer for the future to any letters or memo∣rials that should be thus ushered into the world as inflammatory appeals to the public. Mr. Hampden moved for an address to her majesty, that she would give particular instructions to her plenipotentiaries, that in the conclusion of the treaty of peace, the several powers in alliance with her majesty might be gua∣rantees for the protestant succession in the illustrious house of Hanover. The question being put, was carried in the negative. Then the house resolved, That they had such confidence in the repeated declarations her majesty had made of her concern for assuring to these kingdoms the protestant succession as by law established, that they could never doubt her taking the proper measures for the security thereof: that the house would support her against faction at home and her enemies abroad; and did humbly beseech her, that she would be pleased to dis∣countenance all those who should endeavour to raise jealousies between her ma∣jesty and her subjects, especially by misrepresenting her good intentions for the welfare of her people. The queen was extremely pleased with this resolution. When it was presented, she told them, that they had shewn themselves honest assertors of the monarchy, zealous defenders of the constitution, and real friends to the protestant succession. She thought she had very little reason to counte∣nance a compliment of supererogation to a prince who had caballed with the enemies of her administration. On the twenty-first day of June the queen
<PB N="403" REF="4060"/>
closed the session with a speech, expressing her satisfaction at the addresses and supplies she had received; observing, that should the treaty be broke off, their burthens would be at least continued, if not increased: that Britain would lose the present opportunity of improving her own commerce, and establishing a real balance of power in Europe: and, that though some of the allies might be gainers by a continuance of the war, the rest would suffer in the common ca∣lamity. Notwithstanding the ferment of the people, which was now risen to a very dangerous pitch, addresses approving the queen's conduct were presented by the city of London, and all the corporations in the kingdom that espoused the Tory interest. At this juncture the nation was so wholly possessed by the spirit of party, that no appearance of neutrality or moderation remained.</P>

<P>During these transactions the trenches were opened before Quesnoy, and the siege carried on with uncommon vigour under cover of the forces commanded by the duke of Ormond. This nobleman, however, having received a copy of the articles signed, by the marquis de Torcy, and fresh instructions from the queen, signified to prince Eugene and the Dutch deputies, that the French king had agreed to several articles demanded by the queen, as the foundation of an armistice; and among others, to put the English troops in immediate possession of Dunkirk: that he could therefore no longer cover the siege of Quesnoy, as he was obliged by his instructions to march with the British troops and those in the queen's pay; and declare a suspension of arms as soon as he should be pos∣sessed of Dunkirk. He expressed his hope, that they would readily acquiesce in these instructions, as their concurrence would act as the most powerful mo∣tive to induce the queen to take all possible care of their interests at the con∣gress; and he endeavoured to demonstrate, that Dunkirk, as a cautionary town, was a place of greater consequence to the allies than Quesnoy. The deputies desired he would delay his march five days, that they might have time to con∣sult their principals, and he granted three days without hesitation. Prince Eu∣gene observed, that his marching off with the British troops and the foreigners in the queen's pay, would leave the allies at the mercy of the enemy; but, he hoped these last would not obey the duke's order. He and the deputies had already tampered with their commanding officers, who absolutely refused to obey the duke of Ormond, alledging, that they could not separate from the confederacy without express directions from their masters, to whom they had dispatched couriers. An extraordinary assembly of the states was immediately summoned to meet at the Hague. The ministers of the allies were invited to the confe∣rences. At length, the princes, whose troops were in the pay of Britain, assured them, that they would maintain them under the command of prince Eugene for one month at their own expence, and afterwards sustain half the charge, provided the other half should be defrayed by the emperor and states-general.</P>

<P>The bishop of Bristol imparted to the other plenipotentiaries at Utrecht, the concessions which France would make to the allies; and proposed a suspension of arms for two months, that they might treat in a friendly manner, and adjust the demands of all the confederates. To this proposal they made no other answer, but that they had no instructions on the subject. Count Zinzen∣dorf, the first Imperial plenipotentiary, presented a memorial to the states-general, explaining the danger that would result to the common cause from a
<PB N="404" REF="4070"/>
cessation of arms; and exhorting them to persevere in their generous and vigo∣rous resolutions. He proposed a renewal of the alliance for recovering the Spa∣nisn monarchy to the house of Austria, and a certain plan for prosecuting the war with redoubled ardour. Prince Eugene, in order to dazzle the con∣federates with some bold enterprize, detached major-general Grovestein with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>teen hundred <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avalry, to penetrate into the heart of France.

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The earl of Strafford having returned to Holland, proposed a ces∣sation of arms to the states-general, by whom it was rejected. Then he proceeded to the army of the duke of Ormond, where he arrived in a few days after the reduction of Quesnoy, the garrison of which were made prisoners of war on the fourth day of July. By this time the officers of the foreign troops had a second time refused to obey a written order of the duke, and such a spirit of animosity began to prevail between the English and the allies, that it was judged abso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utely necessary to effect a speedy separation. Prince Eugene resolved to undertake the siege of Landrecy: a design is said to have been formed by the German generals to confine the duke, on pretence of the arrears that were due to them; and disarm the British troops, lest they should join the French army. In the mean time, a literary correspondence was maintained be∣tween the English general and the marechal de Villars. France having con∣sented to deliver up Dunkirk, a body of troops was transported from England, under the command of Brigadier Hill, who took possession of the place on the seventh day of July, the French garrison retiring to Winoxberg. On the six∣teenth of the same month prince Eugene marched from his camp at Haspre, and was followed by all the auxiliaries in the British pay, except a few batta∣lions of the troops of Holstein-Gottorp, and Walef's regiment of dragoons be∣longing to the state of Liege.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>Landrecy was immediately invested, while the duke of Ormond with the English forces removed from Chateau-Cambresis, and encamped at Avesne le Seeg, proclaimed by sound of trumpet a cessation of arms for two months. On the same day the like armis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce was declared in the French army. The Dutch were so exasperated at the secession of the English troops, that the go∣vernors would not allow the earl of Strafford to enter Bouchaine, nor the Bri∣tish army to pass through Doway, though in that town they had left great quan∣tity of stores, together with their general-hospital. Prince Eugene and the
<PB N="405" REF="4080"/>
Dutch deputies understanding, that the duke of Ormond had begun his march towards Ghent, began to be in pain for that city, and sent count Nassau Wou∣denburg to him with a written apology, condemning and disavowing the con∣duct of the commandants of Bouchaine and Douay; but, notwithstanding these excuses, the English troops afterwards met with the same treatment at Tournay, Oudenarde, and Lisle: insults which were resented by the whole British nation. The duke, however, pursued his march, and took possession of Ghent and Bruges for the queen of England: then he reinforced the garrison of Dunkirk, which he likewise supplied with artillery and ammunition. His conduct was no less agreeable to his sovereign than mortifying to the Dutch, who never dreamed of leaving Ghent and Bruges in the hands of the English, and were now fairly outwitted, and anticipated by the motions and expedition of the British general.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="17" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The loss of the British forces was soon severely felt in the allied army. Villars attacked a separate body of their troops encamped at Denain, under the command of the earl of Albemarle. Their intrenchments were forced, and seventeen battalions either killed or taken. The earl himself and all the surviving officers were made prisoners. Five hundred waggons loaded with bread, twelve pieces of brass cannon, a large quantity of ammunition and provisions, a great number of horses, and a considerable booty fell into the hands of the enemy; and this advantage they gained in sight of prince Eu∣gene, who advanced on the other side of the Schelde to sustain Albemarle; but the bridge over that river was broke down by accident; so that he was prevented from lending the least assistance, Villars immediately invested Marchiennes, where the principal stores of the allies were lodged. The place was surrendered on the last day of July; and the garrison, consisting of five thousand men, were conducted prisoners to Valenciennes. He afterwards undertook the siege of Douay; an enterprize, in consequence of which prince Eugene aban∣doned his design on Landrecy, and marched towards the French, in order to hazard an engagement. The states, however, would not run the risque; and the prince had the mortification to see Douay reduced by the enemy. He could not even prevent their retaking Quesnoy and Bouchaine, of which places they were in possession before the tenth day of October; while the allies enjoyed no other compensation for their great losses, but the conquest of Fort Knocque, which was surprised by one of their partisans.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The British ministers at the congress continued to press the Dutch and other allies to join in the armistice; but they were deaf to the proposal, and concerted measures for a vigorous prosecution of the war. Then the earl of Strafford insisted upon their admitting to the congress the plenipotentiaries of king Philip; but he found them equally averse to this expedient. In the begin∣ning of August secretary St. John, now created lord viscount Bolingbroke, was sent to the court of Versailles incognito, to remove all obstructions to the treaty between England and France. He was accompanled by Mr. Prior and the abbé Gualtier, treated with the most distinguished marks of respect, caressed by the French king and the marquis de Torcy, with whom he adjusted the princi∣pal interests of the duke of Savoy and the elector of Bavaria. He settled the time and manner of the renunciations, and agreed to a suspension of arms by sea and land for four months between the crowns of France and England; which was
<PB N="406" REF="4090"/>
accordingly proclaimed at Paris and London. This negotiation being finished in a few days, Bolingbroke returned to England, and Prior remained as resident at the court of France. The states general breathed nothing but war: the pensionary Heinsius pronounced an oration in their assembly, representing the impossibility of concluding a peace without losing the fruits of all the blood and treasure they had expended. The conferences at Utrecht were interrupted by a quarrel between the domestics of Menager and those of the count de Rech∣teren, one of the Dutch plenipotentiaries. The populace insulted the earl of Strafford and the marquis del Borgo, minister of Savoy, whose master was re∣ported to have agreed to the armistice. These obstructions being removed, the conferences were renewed, and the British plenipotentiaries exerted all their rhetoric both in public and private to engage the allies in the queen's measures. The duke of Savoy was prevailed upon to acquiesce in the offers of France. Mr. Thomas Harley had been sent ambassador to Hanover, with a view to persuade the elector that it would be for his interest to co-operate with her ma∣jesty: but, that prince's resolution was already taken. <Q>“Whenever it shall please God (said he) to call me to the throne of Britain, I hope to act as be∣comes me for the advantage of my people: in the mean time speak to me as to a German prince, and a prince of the empire.”</Q> Nor was she more success∣ful in her endeavours to bring over the king of Prussia to her sentiments. Lord Lexington was appointed ambassador to Madrid, where king Philip solemnly swore to observe the renunciation, which was approved and confirmed by the Cortez. The like renunciation to the crown of Spain was afterwards made by the princes of France: and Philip was declared incapable of succeeding to the crown of that realm. The court of Portugal held out against the remonstrances of England, until the marquis Bay invaded that kingdom at the head of twenty thousand men, and undertook the siege of Campo-Major, and they found they had no longer any hope of being assisted by her Britannic majesty. The Por∣tuguese minister at Utrecht signed the suspension of arms on the seventh day of November, and excused this step to the allies, as the pure effect of necessity. The English troops in Spain were ordered to separate from the army of count Staremberg, and march to the neighbourhood of Barcelona, where they were embarked on board of an English squadron, commanded by Sir John Jennings, and transported to Minorca.</P>

<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The campaign being at an end in the Netherlands, the duke of Or∣mond returned to England, where the party-disputes were become more violent than ever. The Whigs affected to celebrate the anniversary of the late king's birth-day in London with extraordinary rejoicings. Mobs were hired by both fac∣tions, and the whole city was filled with riot and uproar. A ridiculous scheme was contrived to frighten the lord-treasurer with some squibs in a band-box, which the ministers magnified into a conspiracy. The duke of Hamilton hav∣ing been appointed ambassador extraordinary to the court of France, the Whigs were alarmed, on the supposition that this nobleman favoured the pretender. Some dispute arising between the duke and lord Mohun on the subject of a law∣suit, furnished a pretence for a quarrel. Mohun, who had been twice tried for murder, and was counted a mean tool, as well as the Hector of the Whig party, sent a message by general Macartney to the duke, challenging him to single combat. The principals met by appointment in Hyde park, attended by Ma∣cartney
<PB N="407" REF="4100"/>
and colonel Hamilton. They fought with such fury, that Mohun was killed upon the spot, and the duke expired before he could be conveyed to his own house. Macartney disappeared, and escaped in disguise to the contiment. Colonel Hamilton declared upon oath before the privy-council, that when the principals engaged, he and Macartney followed their example: that Macartney was immediately disarmed; but the colonel seeing the duke fall upon his anta∣gonist, threw away the swords, and ran to lift him up: that while he was em∣ployed in raising the duke, Macartney having taken up one of the swords, stabbed his grace over Hamilton's shoulder, and retired immediately. A pro∣clamation was issued, promising a reward of five hundred pounds to those who should apprehend or discover Macartney, and the dutchess of Hamilton offered three hundred pounds for the same purpose. The Tories exclaimed against this event as a party duel: they treated Macartney as a cowardly assassin; and affirmed, that the Whigs had posted others of the same stamp all around Hyde-park, in case the duke of Hamilton had triumphed over his an∣tagonist, and escaped the treachery of Macartney. The Whigs, on the other hand, affirm, that it was altogether a private quarrel: that Macartney was in∣tirely innocent of the perfidy layed to his charge: that he afterwards submitted to a fair trial, at which colonel Hamilton prevaricated in giving his evidence, and was contradicted by the testimony of divers persons who saw the combat at a distance. The duke of Marlborough hearing himself accused as the author of those party-mischiefs, and seeing his enemies grow every day more and more implacable, thought proper to retire to the continent, whither he was fol∣lowed by his dutchess. His friend Godolphin had died in September, with the general character of an able, cool, dispassionate minister, who had rendered himself necessary to four successive sovereigns, and managed the finances with equal skill and integrity. The duke of Shrewsbury was nominated ambassador to France, in the room of the duke of Hamilton: the duke D'Aumont arrived at London in the same quality from the court of Versailles; and about the same time the queen granted an audience to the marquis de Monteleone, whom Philip had appointed one of his plenipotentiaries at the congress.</P>

<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>In vain had the British ministers in Holland endeavoured to over∣come the obstinacy of the states-general, by alternate threats, promises, and arguments. In vain did they represent, that the confederacy against France could be no longer supported with any prospect of success: that the queen's aim had been to procure reasonable terms for her allies; but that their opposition to her measures prevented her from obtaining such conditions as she would have a right to demand in their favour, were they unanimous in their consultations. In November, the earl of Strafford presented a new plan of peace, in which the queen promised to insist upon France's ceding to the states the city of Tournay, and some other places which they could not expect to possess, should she conclude a separate treaty. They now began to waver in their councils. The first transports of their resentment having subsided, they plainly perceived that the continuation of the war would intail upon them a burden which they could not bear, especially since the duke of Savoy and the king of Portugal had deserted the alliance: besides, they were staggered by the affair of the new barrier, so much more advantageous than that which France had proposed in the beginning of the conferences. They were influenced by another motive:
<PB N="408" REF="4110"/>
namely, the appr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hension of new mischiefs to the empire from the king of Sweden, whose affairs seemed to take a favourable turn at the Ottoman Porte, through the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntercession of the French monarch. The czar and king Augustus had pe∣netrated into Pomerani<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: the king of Denmark had taken Staden, reduced Bremen, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ayed Hamburgh under contribution; but count Steenbock the Swedish general defeated the Danish army in Mecklenburg, ravaged Holstein with great b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rbari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, and reduced the town of Altena to ashes. The grand signor threatened to dec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are war against the czar, on pretence that he had not performed some essential articles of the late peace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but his real motive was an incl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ation to support the king of Sweden. This disposition, however, was de∣feated by a powerful party at the Porte, which was averse to war. Charles, who still remained at Bender, was desired to return to his own kingdom, and given to understand, that the sultan would procure him a safe passage. He treated the person who brought this intimation with the most ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rageous inso∣lence; rejected the proposal, fortified his house; and resolved to defend him∣self to the last extremity. Being attacked by a considerable body of Turkish forces, he and his attendants fought with the most frantic valour. They slew some hundreds of the assailants; but, at last, they set fire to the house: so that he was obliged to surrender himself and his followers, who were generally sold for slaves. He himself was conveyed under a strong guard to Adrianople. Mean while the czar landed with an army in Finland, which he totally reduced. Steenbock maintained himself in Tonningen until all his supplies were cut off; and then he was obliged to deliver himself and his troops prisoners of war. But this reverse was not foreseen when the Dutch dreaded a rupture between the Porte and the Muscovites, and were given to understand, that the Turks would revive the troubles in Hungary. In that case, they knew the emperor would recal great part of his troops from the Netherlands, where the burden of the war must lie upon their shoulders. After various consultations in their different assemblies, they came into the queen's measures, and figned the barrier∣treaty.</P>

<P>Then the plenipo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entiaries of the four associated circles presented a remonstrance to the British ministers at Utrecht, imploring the queen's inter∣position in their favour, that they might not be left in the miserable condition to which they had been reduced by former treaties. They were given to under∣stand, that if they should not obtain what they desired, they themselves would be justly blamed as the authors of their disappointment: that they had been deficient in furnishing their proportion of troops and other necessaries; and left the whole burden of the war to fall upon the queen and the states in the Ne∣therlands: that when a cessation was judged necessary, they had deserted her majesty to follow the chimerical projects of prince Eugene: that, while she pro∣secuted the war with the utmost vigour, they had acted with coldness and in∣difference; but when she inclined to peace they began to exert themselves in prosecuting hostilities with uncommon eagerness: that, nevertheless, she would no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> abandon their interests, but endeavour to procure for them as good con∣ditions as their preposterous conduct would allow her to demand. Even the emperor's plenipotentiaries began to talk in more moderate terms. Zinzendorf declared, that his master was very well disposed to promote a general peace; and no longer insisted on a cession of the Spanish monarchy to the house of Au∣stria.
<PB N="409" REF="4120"/>

<P>The pacification between France and England was retarded, how∣ever, by some unforeseen difficulties that arose in adjusting the commerce and the limits of the countries possessed by both nations in North-America. A long dispute ensued; and the duke of Shrewsbury and Prior held many conferences with the French ministry: at length, it was compromised, though not much to the advantage of Great Britain; and the English plenipotentiaries received an order to sign a separate treaty. They declared to the ministers of the other powers, that they and some other plenipotentiaries were ready to sign their re∣spective treaties on the eleventh day of April. Count Zinzendorf endeavoured to postpone this transaction until he should be furnished with fresh instructions from Vienna; and even threatened that if the states should sign the peace con∣trary<NOTE PLACE="marg">Burnet.

The ministers of Great Britain agreed with those of France, that his Imperial majesty should have time to consider whether he would or would not accept the proposals; but this time was extended no farther than the first day of June; nor would they agree to a cessation of arms during that inter∣val. Mean while the peace with France was signed in different treaties by the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, Savoy, Prussia, Portugal, and the states-general. On the fourteenth day of the month the British plenipotentiaries de∣livered to count Zinzendorf in writing, <Q>“offers and demands of the French king for making peace with the house of Austria and the empire.”</Q> The count and the ministers of the German princes exclaimed against the insolence of France, which had not even bestowed the title of emperor on Joseph; but wanted to impose terms upon them with relation to the electors of Cologne and Bavaria.</P>

<P>The treaties of peace and commerce between England and France<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1713.</NOTE> being ratified by the queen of England, the parliament was assembled on the ninth day of April. The queen told them the treaty was signed, and that in a few days the ratifications would be exchanged. She said, what she had done for the protestant succession, and the perfect friendship subsisting between her and the house of Hanover, would convince those who wished well to both, and desired the quiet and safety of their country, how vain all attempts were to divide them. She left it intirely to the house of commons to determine what force might be necessary for the security of trade by sea, and for guards and gar∣risons. <Q>“Make yourselves safe (said she) and I shall be satisfied.

She desired they would con∣cert proper measures for easing the foreign trade of the kingdom; for improving and encouraging manufactures and the fishery; and for employing the hands of idle people. She expressed her displeasure at the scandalous and seditious libels which had been lately published. She exhorted them to consider of new laws to prevent this licentiousness, as well as for putting a stop to the impious prac∣tice of duelling. She conjured them to use their utmost endeavours to calm
<PB N="410" REF="4130"/>
the minds of men at home, that the arts of peace might be cultivated; and that groundless jealousies contrived by a faction, and fomented by party-rage, might not effect that which their foreign enem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es could not accomplish. This was the language of a p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous, candid, and benevolent sovereign, who loved her subjects with a truly parental affection. The parliament considered her in that light. Each house presented her with a warm address of thanks and congratulation, expressing in particular, their inviolable attachment to the protestant succession in the illustrious house of Hanover. The ratifications of the treaty being ex∣changed, the peace was proclaimed on the fifth of May, with the usual cere∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nies, to the inexpress<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble joy of the nation in general; and it was about this period, that the chevalier de St. George conveyed a printed remonstrance to the ministers at Utrecht, solemnly protesting against all that might be stipulated to his prejudice. The commons, in a second address, had besought her majesty to communicate to the house in due time the treaties of peace and commerce with France; and now they were produced by Mr. Benson chancellor of the ex∣chequer.</P>

<P>By the treaty of peace the French king obliged himself to aban∣don the pretender, acknowledge the queen's title and the protestant succession; to raze the fortifications of Dunkirk within a limited time, on condition of receiving an equivalent: to cede Newfoundland, Hudson's-bay, and St. Christopher's, to England; but, the French were left in possession of Cape Breton, and at liberty to dry their fish on Newfoundland. By the treaty of commerce a free trade was established, according to the tariff of the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-four, except in some commodities that were subjected to new regulations in the year sixteen hundred and ninety-nine. It was agreed, That no other duties should be imposed on the productions of France imported into England, than those that were layed on the same commodities from other countries: and, That commissaries should meet at London to adjust all matters relating to com∣merce: as for the tariff with Spain, it was not yet finished. It was stipulated, That the emperor should possess the kingdom of Naples, the dutchy of Milan, and the Spanish Netherlands: That the duke of Savoy should enjoy Sicily, with the title of king: That the same title, with the island of Sardinia, should be allotted to the elector of Bavaria, as an indemnification for his losses: That the states-general should restore Liste and its dependencies: and, That Namur, Charleroy, Luxemburg, Ypres, and Newport, should be added to the other places they already possessed in Flanders: That the king of Prussia should have Upper Gueldre, in lieu of Orange and the other estates belonging to that family in Franche Comté. The king of Portugal was satisfied; and the first day of June was fixed as the period of time granted to the emperor for conside∣ration.</P>

<P>A day being appointed by the commons to deliberate upon the treaty <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f commerce, very just and weighty objections were made to the eighth and ninth artieles, importing, That Great Britain and France should mutually en∣joy all the privileges in trading with each other, that either granted to the most favoured nation; and that no higher customs should be exacted from the com∣modities of France, than those that were drawn from the same productions of any other people. The balance of trade having long inclined to the side of France, severe duties had been laid on all the productions and manufactures of
<PB N="411" REF="4140"/>
that kingdom, so as almost to amount to a total prohibition. Some members observed, that, by the treaty between England and Portugal, the duties charged upon the wines of that country, were lower than those layed upon the wines of France: that should they now be reduced to an equality, the difference of freight was so great, that the French wines would be found much cheaper than those of Portugal; and, as they were more agreeable to the taste of the nation in general, there would be no market for the Portuguese wines in England: that should this be the case, the English would lose their trade with Portugal, the most advantageous of any traffic which they now carried on: for it con∣sumed a great quantity of their manufactures, and returned a yearly sum of six hundred thousand pounds in gold. Mr. Nathaniel Gould, formerly governor of the bank, affirmed, that as France had, since the revolution, encouraged woollen manufactures, and prepared at home several commodities which for∣merly they drew from England; so the English had learned to make silk stuffs, paper, and all manner of toys formerly imported from France: by which means, an infinite number of artificers was employed, and a vast sum annually saved to the nation: but these people would now be reduced to beggary, and that money lost again to the kingdom, should French commodities of the same kind be imported under ordinary duties, because labour was much cheaper in France than in England, consequently the British manufactures would be undersold and ruined. He urged, that the ruin of the silk manufacture would be at∣tended with another disadvantage. Great quantities of woollen cloths were vended in Italy and Turky, in consequence of the raw silk which the English merchants bought up in those countries; and, should the silk manufacture at home be lost, those markets for British commodities would fail of course. Others alledged, that if the articles of commerce had been settled before the English troops separated from those of the confederates, the French king would not have presumed to insist upon such terms, but have been glad to comply with more moderate conditions. Sir William Wyndham reflected on the late mini∣stry, for having neglected to make an advantageous peace when it was in their power. He said, that Portugal would always have occasion for the woollen manufactures and the corn of England, and be obliged to buy them at all events. After a violent debate, the house resolved, by a great majority, That a bill should be brought in to make good the eighth and ninth articles of the treaty of commerce with France. Against these articles, however, the Por∣tuguese minister presented a memorial, declaring, that should the duties on French wines be lowered to the same level with those that were layed on the wines of Portugal, his master would renew the prohibition of the woollen ma∣nufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed all the trading part of the nation exclaimed against the treaty of commerce, which seems to have been concluded in a hurry, before the ministers fully understood the nature of the subject. This precipitation was owing to the fears that their endeavours after peace would miscarry, from the intrigues of the Whig faction, and the obstinate opposition of the confederates.</P>

<P>The commons having granted an aid of two shillings in the pound, proceeded to renew the duty on malt for another year, and extended this tax to the whole island, notwithstanding the warm remonstrances of the Scottish members, who represented it as a burden which their country could

not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> They insisted upon an express article of the union, stipulating, That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o duty should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t in Scotland during the war, which they affirmed was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> inasmuch as the peace with Spain had not been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> During the adjournment of the parliament, on account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Scots if both houses laying aside all party-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinctions, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on this subject. They deputed the duke of Argyle, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Mar, Mr. Lockhart, and Mr. Cockburne, to lay their grievances be∣fore the queen. They represented, that their countrymen bore with impatience the violation of some articles of the union; and that the imposition of such an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n as the malt-tax, would in all probability prompt them to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the union dissolved. The queen, alarmed at this remonstrance, an∣swered, that she wished they might not have cause to repent of such a precipi∣tate resolution; but she would endeavour to make all things easy. On the first day of June, the earl of Findlater, in the house of peers, represented that the Scottish nation was aggrieved in many instances: that they were deprived of a privy-council; subjected to the English laws in cases of treason; that their nobles were rendered incapable of being created British peers; and that now they were oppressed with the insupportable burden of a malt-tax, when they had reason to expect they should reap the benefits of peace: he therefore moved, that leave <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight be given to bring in a bill for dissolving the union, and se∣curing the protestant succession in the house of Hanover. The lord North and Grey affirmed, that the complaints of the Scots were groundless; that the dissolution of the union was impracticable; and he made some sarcastic reflections on the poverty of that nation. He was answered by the earl of Eglington, who admitted the Scots were poor, and therefore unable to pay the malt-tax. The earl of Hay, among other pertinent remarks upon the union, observed, that when the treaty was made, the Scots took it for granted that the parliament of Great Britain would never load them with any imposition that they had reason to believe grievous. The earl of Peterborough compared the union to a marriage. He said, that though England, who must be supposed the hus∣band, might in some instances prove unkind to the lady, she ought not im∣mediately to sue for a divorce, the rather because she had very much mended her fortune by the match. Ilay replied, that marriage was an ordinance of God; and the union, no more than a political expedient. The other affirmed, that the contract could not have been more solemn, unless, like the ten com∣mendments, it had come from heaven: he inveighed against the Scots as a people that would never be satisfied; that would have all the advantages re∣sulting from the union, but would pay nothing by their good will, although they had received more money from England than the amount of all their estates. To these animadversions the duke of Argyle made a very warm re∣ply. <Q>“I have been reflected on by some people (said he) as if I was disgusted and had changed sides; but I despise their persons, as much as I undervalue their judgment.”</Q> He urged, that the malt-tax in Scotland was like taxing land by the acre throughout England, because land was worth five pounds an acre in the neighbourhood of London, and would not fetch so many <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>llings in the remote counties. In like manner, the English malt was valued at four times the price of that which was made in Scotland; therefore the tax in this country must be levied by a regiment of drag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons. He owned
<PB N="413" REF="4160"/>
he had a great share in making the union, with a view to secure the protestant succession; but he was now satisfied this end might be answered as effectually if the union was dissolved; and, if this step should not be taken, he did not expect long to have either property left in Scotland, or liberty in England. All the Whig members voted for the dissolution of that treaty which they had so eagerly promoted; while the Tories strenuously supported the measure against which they had once argued with such vehemence. In the course of the debate, the lord treasurer observed, that although the malt-tax were imposed, it might be afterwards remitted by the crown. The earl of Sunderland expressed sur∣prize at hearing that noble lord broach a doctrine which tended to establish a despotic dispensing power and arbitrary government. Oxford replied, his family had never been famous, as some others had been, for promoting and advising arbitrary measures. Sunderland considering this expression as a sar∣casm levelled at the memory of his father, took occasion to vindicate his con∣duct; adding, that in those days the other lord's family was hardly known. Much violent altercation was discharged. At length the motion for the bill was rejected by a small majority, and the malt-bill afterwards passed with great difficulty.</P>

<P>Another bill being brought into the house of commons, for rendering the treaty of commerce effectual, such a number of petitions were delivered against it, and so many solid arguments advanced by the merchants who were examined on the subject, that even a great number of Tory mem∣bers were convinced of the bad consequence it would produce to trade, and voted against the ministry on this occasion; so that the bill was rejected by a majority of nine voices. At the same time, however, the house agreed to an address, thanking her majesty for the great care she had taken of the security and honour of her kingdoms in the treaty of peace; as also for having layed so good a foundation for the interest of her people in trade. They likewise be∣sought her to appoint commissioners to treat with those of France, for adjusting such matters as should be necessary to be settled on the subject of commerce, that the treaty might be explained and perfected for the good and welfare of her people. The queen interpreted this address into a full approbation of the treaties of peace and commerce, and thanked them accordingly in the warmest terms of satisfaction and acknowledgment. The commons afterwards desired to know what equivalent should be given for the demolition of Dunkirk; and she gave them to understand, that this was already in the hands of his most christian majesty: then they besought her that she would not evacuate the towns of Flanders that were in her possession, until those who were intitled to the sovereignty of the Spanish Netherlands should agree to such articles for regu∣lating trade as might place the subjects of Great Britain upon an equal footing with those of any other nation. The queen made a favourable answer to all their remonstrances. Such were the steps taken by the parliament during this session, with relation to the famous treaty of Utrecht, against which the Whigs so violently exclaimed, that many well-meaning people believed it would be attended with the immediate ruin of the kingdom: yet, under the shadow of this v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry treaty, Great Britain enjoyed a long term of peace and tranquillity. Bishop Burnet was heated with an enthusiastic terror of the house of Bourbon. He declared to the queen in private, that any treaty by which Spain and the
<PB N="414" REF="4170"/>
West Indies were left in the hands of king Philip, must in a little time deliver all Europe into the hands of France: that if any such peace was made, the queen was betrayed and her people ruined: that in less than three years she would be murdered, and the fires would blaze again in Smithfield. This pre∣late lived to see his prognostic disappointed; therefore he might have suppressed this anecdote.</P>

<DIV4 N="28" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>On the twenty-fifth day of June, the queen signified, in a message to the house of commons, that her civil list was burdened with some debts incurred by several articles of extraordinary expence; and that she hoped they would impower her to raise such a sum of money upon the funds for that provision, as would be sufficient to discharge the incumbrances, which amounted to five hundred thousand pounds. A bill was immediately prepared for raising this sum on the civil-list revenue, and passed through both houses with some difficulty. Both lords and commons addressed the queen concerning the che∣valier de St. George, who had repaired to Lorrain. They desired she would press the duke of that name, and all the princes and states in amity with her, to exclude from their dominions the pretender to the imperial crown of Great Britain. A public thanksgiving for the peace was appointed and celebrated with great solemnity; and, on the sixteenth day of July, the queen closed the session with a speech which was not at all agreeable to the violent Whigs, be∣cause it did not contain one word about the pretender and the protestant suc∣cession. From these omissions they concluded, that the dictates of natural af∣fection had bia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed her in favour of the chevalier de St. George. Whatever sentiments of tenderness and compassion she might feel for that unfortunate exile, the acknowledged son of her own father, it does not appear that she ever entertained a thought of altering the succession as by law established. The term of Sacheverel's suspension being expired, extraordinary rejoicings were made upon the occasion. He was desired to preach before the house of commons, who thanked him for his ser<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; and the queen promoted him to the rich benefice of St. Andrew's Holborn. On the other hand, the duke D'Aumont, ambassador from France, was insulted by the populace. Scurrilous ballads were published against him, both in the English and French languages. He received divers anonymous letters, containing threats of setting fire to his house, which was accordingly burned to the ground, though whether by ac∣cident or design he could not well determine. The magistracy of Dunkirk having sent a deputa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion with an address to the queen, humbly imploring her majesty to spare the port and harbour of that town, and representing that they might be useful to her own subjects, the memorial was printed and dispersed, and the arguments it contained were answered and refuted by Addison, Steele, and Maynwaring. Commissioners were sent to see the fortifications of Dun∣kirk demolished. They were accordingly razed to the ground; the harbour was filled up; and the duke D'Aumont returned to Paris in the month of November. The queen, by her remonstrances to the court of Versailles, had procured the enlargement of one hundred and thirty-six protestants from the gallies; but understanding that as many more were detained on the same ac∣count, she made such application to the French ministry, that they too were released. Then she appointed general Ross her envoy extraordinary to the king of France.</P>

<P>The duke of Shrewsbury being nominated lord lieutenant of Ireland, assembled the parliament of that kingdom on the twenty fifth day of November, and found the two houses still at variance, on the opposite principles of Whig and Tory. Allan Broderick being chosen speaker of the commons, they ordered a bill to be brought in to attaint the pretender and all his ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e∣rents. They prosecuted Edward Loyd for publishing a book intituled, <Q>“Me∣moirs of the chevalier de St. George;”</Q> and they agreed upon an address to the queen, to remove from the chancellorship Sir Constantine Phipps, who had countenanced the Tories of that kingdom. The lords, however, resolved, that chancellor Phipps had, in his several stations, acquitted himself with honour and integrity. The two houses of convocation presented an address to the same purpose. They likewise complained of Mr. Molesworth, for ha∣ving insulted them, by saying, when they appeared in the castle of Dublin, "They that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;" and he was removed from the privy-council. The duke of Shrewsbury received orders to prorogue this parliament, which was divided against itself, and portended nothing but domestic broils. Then he obtained leave to return to England, leaving chancellor Phipps, with the archbishops of Armagh and Tuam, justices of the kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament of England had been dissolved; and the elections were managed in such a manner as to retain the legislative power in the hands of the Tories: but the meeting of the new parliament was delayed by repeated pro∣rogations to the tenth day of December; a delay partly owing to the queen's indisposition; and partly to the contests among her ministers. Oxford and Bo∣lingbroke were competitors for power, and rivals in reputation for ability. The treasurer's parts were deemed the more solid; the secretary's more shining: but both ministers were aspiring and ambitious. The first was bent upon main∣taining the first rank in the administration, which he had possessed since the re∣volution in the ministry: the other disdained to act as a subaltern to the man whom he thought he excelled in genius and equalled in importance. They began to form separate cabals, and adopt different principles. Bolingbroke insinuated himself into the confidence of lady Masham, to whom Oxford had given some cause of disgust. By this communication he gained ground in the good opinion of his sovereign, while the treasurer lost it in the same pro∣portion. Thus she who had been the author of his elevation, was now used as the instrument of his disgrace. The queen was sensibly affected with these dissensions, which she interposed her advice and authority by turns to appease; but their mutual animosity continued to rankle under an exterior accommoda∣tion. The interest of Bolingbroke was powerfully supported by Sir Simon Harcourt the chancellor, Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. secretary Bromley. Oxford perceived his own influence was in the wane, and began to think of re∣tirement. Mean while, the earl of Peterborough was appointed ambassador to the king of Sicily; and set out for Turin. The queen retired to Windsor, where she was seized with a very dangerous inflammatory fever. The hopes of the Jacobites visibly rose: the public funds immediately fell: a great run was made upon the bank, the directors of which were overwhelmed with con∣sternation, which was not a little increased by the report of an armament equipped in the ports of France. They sent one of their members to represent
<PB N="416" REF="4190"/>
to the treasurer the danger that threatened the public credit. The queen being made acquainted with these occurrences, signed a letter to Sir Samuel Stancer lord-mayor of London, declaring, that now she was recovered of her late in∣disposition, she would return to the place of her usual residence, and open the parliament on the sixteenth day of February. This intimation she sent to her loving subjects of the city of London, to the intent that all of them, in their several stations, might discountenance those malicious rumours spread by evil∣minded persons, to the prejudice of credit, and to the imminent hazard of the public peace and tranquillity. The queen's recovery, together with certain in∣telligence that the armament was a phantom, and the pretender still in Lor∣rain, helped to assuage the ferment of the nation, which had been industri∣ously raised by party-writings. Mr. Richard Steele published a performance intituled "The Crisis," in defence of the revolution, and the protestant esta∣blishment, and enlarging upon the danger of popish successor. On the other hand, the hereditary rights of the crown of England was asserted in a large volume, supposed to be written with a view to pave the way for the pre∣tender's accession. One Bedford was apprehended, tried, convicted, and se∣verely punished, as the publisher of this treatise.</P>

<P>While England was harrassed by these intestine commotions, the emperor rejecting the terms of peace proposed by France, resolved to main∣tain the war at his own expence, with the assistance of the empire. His forces on the Rhine, commanded by prince Eugene, was so much outnumbered by the French under Villars, that they could not prevent the enemy from reducing the two important fortresses of Landau and Friburg. His Imperial majesty hoped, that the death of queen Anne, or that of Lewis XIV. would produce an alteration in Europe that might be favourable to his interest; and he de∣pended upon the conduct and fortune of prince Eugene for some lucky event in war. But finding himself disappointed in all these expectations, and absolutely unable to support the expence of another campaign, he hearkened to over∣tures of peace that were made by the electors of Cologne and Palatine; and conferences were opened at the castle of Al-Rastadt, between prince Eugene and marechal de Villars, on the twenty sixth day of November. In the be∣ginning of February they separated, without seeming to have come to any conclusion: but all the articles being settled between the courts of Vienna and Versailles, they met again at the latter end of the month: the treaty was signed on the third day of March; and orders were sent to the governors and com∣manders on both sides, to desist from all hostilities. By this treaty, the French king yielded to the emperor Old Brisac, with all its dependencies, Friburg, the forts in the Brisgau and Black Forest, together with fort Khel. He engaged to demolish the fortifications opposite to Huningen, the fort of Sellingen, and all between that and Fort Louis. The town and fortress of Landau were ceded to the king of France, who acknowledged the elector of Hanover. The elec∣tors of Bavaria and Cologne were restored to all their dignities and dominions. The emperor was put in immediate possession of the Spanish Netherlands; and the king of Prussia was permitted to retain the high quarter of Gueldres. Finally, the contracting parties agreed that a congress should be opened on the first of May, at Baden in Swisserland, for terminating all differences; and prince Eugene and marechal de Villars were appointed their first plenipotentiaries.</P>

<P>The ratifications of the treaty between Great Britain and Spain being exchanged, the peace was proclaimed on the first day of March, in London; and the articles were not disagreeable to the English nation. The kingdoms of France and Spain were separated for ever. Philip acknowledged the protestant succession, and renounced the pretender. He agreed to a renewal of the treaty of navigation and commerce concluded in the year one thousand six hundred and sixty-seven. He granted an exclusive privilege to the English for fur∣nishing the Spanish West Indies with negroes, according to the assiento-con∣tract. He ceded Gibraltar to England, as well as the island of Minorca, on condition that the Spanish inhabitants should enjoy their estates and religion. He obliged himself to grant a full pardon to the Catalonians, with the pos∣session of all their estates, honours, and privileges, and to yield the kingdom of Sicily to the duke of Savoy. The new parliament was opened by com∣mission in February, and Sir Thomas Hanmer was chosen speaker of the house of commons. On the second day of March, the queen being carried in a sedan to the house of lords, signified to both houses, that she had obtained an honourable and advantageous peace for her own people, and for the greatest part of her allies; and she hoped her interposition might prove effectual to complete the settlement of Europe. She observed, that some persons had been so malicious as to insinuate that the protestant succession in the house of Ha∣nover was in danger under her government; but that those who endeavoured to distract the minds of men with imaginary dangers, could only mean to disturb the public tranquillity. She said, that after all she had done to secure religion and the liberties of her people, she could not mention such proceedings without some degree of warmth; and she hoped her parliament would agree with her, that attempts to weaken her authority, or to render the possession of the crown uneasy to her, could never be proper means to strengthen the pro∣testant succession. Affectionate addresses were presented by the lords, the com∣mons, and the convocation: but the ill humour of party still subsisted, and was daily inflamed by new pamphlets and papers. Steele, supported by Ad∣dison and Hallifax, appeared in the front of those who drew their pens in de∣fence of Whig principles; and Swift was the champion of the ministry.</P>

<P>The earl of Wharton complained in the house of lords of a libel intituled, <Q>“The public spirit of the Whigs, set forth in their ge∣nerous encouragement of the author of the Crisis.”</Q> It was a sarcastic per∣formance, imputed to lord Bolingbroke and Swift, interspersed with severe re∣flections upon the union, the Scottish nation, and the duke of Argyle in par∣ticular. The lord treasurer disclaimed all knowledge of the author, and readily concurred in an order for taking into custody John Morphew the pub∣lisher, as well as John Barber, printer of the Gazette, from whose house the copies were brought to Morphew. The earl of Wharton said it highly con∣cerned the honour of that august assembly, to find out the villain who was author of that false and scandalous libel, that justice might be done to the Scottish nation. He moved, that Barber and his servants might be examined: but, next day, the earl of Mar, one of the secretaries of state, declared, that, in pursuance to her majesty's command, he had directed John Barber to be prosecuted. Notwithstanding this interposition, which was calculated to screen the offenders, the lords presented an address, beseeching her majesty to issue
<PB N="418" REF="4210"/>
out her royal proclamation, promising a reward to any person who should dis∣cover the author of the libel which they conceived to be false, malicious, and factious, highly dishonourable and scandalous to her majesty's subjects of Scot∣land, most injurious to her majesty, and tending to the ruin of the constitu∣tion. In compliance with their request, a reward of three hundred pounds was offered; but the author remained safe from all detection.</P>

<P>The commons having granted the supplies, ordered a bill to be brought in for securing the freedom of parliaments, by limiting the number of officers in the house of commons; and it passed through both houses with little difficulty. In March, a complaint was made of several scandalous papers lately published, under the name of Richard Steele, esquire, a member of the house. Sir William Wyndham observed, that some of that author's writings contained insolent, injurious, reflections on the queen herself, and were dictated by the spirit of rebellion. Steele was ordered to attend in his place: some pa∣ragraphs of his works were read; and he answered them with an affected air of self-confidence and unconcern. A day being appointed for his trial, he acknow∣ledged the writings, and entered into a more circumstantial defence. He was assisted by Mr. Addison, general Stanhope, and Mr. Walpole; and attacked by Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Foley, and the attorney general. Whatever could be urged in his favour was but little regarded by the majority, which voted, that two pamphlets, intituled, "The Englishman, and the Crisis," written by Richard Steele, esquire, were scandalous and seditious libels; and that he should be expelled the house of commons.</P>

<P>The lords taking into consideration the state of the nation, re∣solved upon addresses to the queen, desiring they might know what steps had been taken for removing the pretender from the dominions of the duke of Lor∣rain: that she would impart to them an account of the negotiations of peace; an account of the instances which had been made in favour of the Catalans; and an account of the monies granted by parliament since the year one thou∣sand seven hundred and ten, to carry on the war in Spain and Portugal. They afterwards agreed to other addresses, beseeching her majesty to lay before them the debts and state of the navy, the particular writs of Noli prosequi granted since her accession to the throne; and a list of such persons as, notwithstanding sentence of outlawry or attainder, had obtained licences to return into Great Britain, or other her majesty's dominions since the revolution. Having voted an application to the queen in behalf of the distressed Catalans, the house ad∣journed itself to the last day of March. As the minds of men had been artfully irritated by false reports of a design undertaken by France in behalf of the pre∣tender, the ambassador of that crown at the Hague disowned it in a public paper, by command of his most christian majesty. The suspicions of many people, however, had been too deeply planted by the arts and insinuations of the Whig leaders, to be eradicated by this or any other declaration; and what served to rivet their apprehensions, was a total removal of the Whigs from all the employments civil and military which they had hitherto retained.

Those were steps which her own sagacity must have suggested; and which her ministers would naturally advise as necessary for their own preservation. The Whigs were all in commotion, either apprehending, or affecting to apprehend, that a design was formed to secure the pretender's succes∣sion to the throne of Great Britain. Their chiefs held secret consultations with<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1714.</NOTE> baron Schutz, the resident from Hanover. They communicated their observa∣tions to the elector: they received his instructions; they maintained a corre∣spondence with the duke of Marlborough; and they concerted measures for op∣posing all efforts that might be made against the protestant succession upon the death of the queen, whose health was by this time so much impaired, that every week was believed to be the last of her life. This conduct of the Whigs was resolute, active, and would have been laudable, had their zeal been confined within the bounds of truth and moderation; but they, moreover, employed all their arts to excite and encourage the fears and jealousies of the people.</P>

<P>The house of peers resounded with debates upon the Catalans, the pretender, and the danger that threatened the protestant succession. With respect to the Catalonians, they represented, that Great Britain had prevailed upon them to declare for the house of Austria, with promise of support; and that these engagements ought to have been made good. Lord Bolingbroke de∣clared, that the queen had used all her endeavours in their behalf; and that her engagements with them subsisted no longer than king Charles resided in Spain. They agreed, however, to an address, acknowledging her majesty's endeavours in favour of the Catalans, and requesting she would continue her interposition in their behalf. With respect to the pretender, the Whig lords expressed such a spirit of persecution and rancorous hate, as would have disgraced the members of any, even the lowest assembly of christians. Not contented with hunting him from one country to another, they seemed eagerly bent upon extirpating him from the face of the earth, as if they had thought it was a crime in him to be born. The earl of Sunderland declared, from the information of the minister of Lorrain, that notwithstanding the application of both houses to her ma∣jesty during the last session, concerning the pretender's being removed from Lorrain, no instances had yet been made to the duke for that purpose. Lord Bolingbroke affirmed, that he himself had made those instances in the queen's name, to that very minister before his departure from England. The earl of Wharton proposed a question, <Q>“Whether the protestant succession was in danger under the present administration?”</Q> A warm debate ensued, in which the arch∣bishop of York and the earl of Anglesey joined in the opposition to the ministry. The earl pretended to be convinced and converted by the arguments used in the course of the debate. He owned he had given his assent to the cessation of arms, for which he took shame to himself, asking pardon of God, his country, and his conscience. He affirmed, that the honour of his sovereign, and the good of his country, were the rules of his actions; but, that without respect of persons, should he find himself imposed upon, he durst pursue an evil minister from the queen's closet to the Tower, and from the Tower to the scaffold.
<PB N="420" REF="4230"/>
This conversion, however, was much more owing to a full persuasion, that a ministry divided against itself could not long subsist; and, that the protestant succession was firmly secured. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> resolved to make a merit of with∣drawing himself from the interests of a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ottering administration, in whose ruin he night be involved.

The treasurer laying his hand upon his breast, said, he had on so many occasions given such signal proofs of affection to the protestant succes∣sion, that he was sure no member of that august assembly did call it in ques∣tion. He owned he had remitted for two or three years past, between three and four thousand pounds to the Highland clans; and he hoped the house would give him an opportunity to clear his conduct in that particular; and, with respect to the reformed officers, he declared, he had given orders for their being immedi∣ately payed. The protestant succession was voted out of danger by a small ma∣jority.</P>

<DIV4 N="37" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVII.</HEAD>
<P>Lord Hallifax proposed an address to the queen, that she would renew her instances for the speedy removing the pretender out of Lorrain; and that she would, in conjunction with the states general, enter into the gua∣ranty of the protestant succession in the house of Hanover. The earl of Whar∣tin moved, that in the address her majesty should be desired to issue a procla∣mation, promising a reward to any person who should apprehend the pretender dead or alive. He was seconded by the duke of Bolton; and the house agreed, that an address should be presented. When it was reported by the committee, the lord North and Grey expatiated upon the barbarity of setting a price on any one's head: he proved it was an encouragement to murder and assassination; contrary to the precepts of Christianity: repugnant to the law of nature and nations; inconsistent with the dignity of such an august assembly, was with the honour of a nation famed for lenity and mercy. He was supported by lord Frevor, who moved, that the reward should be promised for apprehend∣ing and bringing the pretender to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice, in case he should land or attempt to land in Great Britain or Ireland. The cruelty of the first clause was zealously supported and vindicared by the lords Cowper and Hallifax; but, by this time the earls of Anglesey and some others who had abandoned the ministry, were brought back their former principles, by promise of profitable employments; and the mitigation was adopted by a majority of ten voices. To this address, which was delivered by the chancellor and the Whig lords only, the queen re∣plied in these words. <Q>“My lords, it would be a real strengthening to the suc∣cession in the house of Hanover, as well as a support to my government,
<PB N="421" REF="4240"/>
that an end were put to those groundless fears and jealousies which have been so industriously promoted. I do not at this time see any occasion for such a proclamation. Whenever I judge it to be necessary, I shall give my orders for having it issued. As to the other particulars of this address, I will give proper directions therein.”</Q> She was likewise importuned by another address, to issue out a proclamation against all jesuits, popish priests, and bishops, as well as against all such as were outlawed for adhering to the late king James and the pretender. They resolved, That no person, not included in the articles of Li∣merick, and who had borne arms in France and Spain, should be capable of any employment civil or military: and, That no person, a natural-born subject of her majesty, should be capable of sustaining the character of a public mi∣nister from any foreign potentate. These resolutions were aimed at Sir Patrick Lawless, an Irish papist, who had come to England with a credential letter from king Philip, but now thought proper to quit the kingdom.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="38" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Then the lords in the opposition made an attack upon the trea∣surer, concerning the money he had remitted to the Highlanders; but he silenced his opposers, by asserting, that in so doing, he had followed the exam∣ple of king William, who, after he had reduced that people, thought fit to allow yearly pensions to the heads of clans, in order to keep them quiet. His conduct was approved by the house; and the lord North and Grey moved, That a day might be appointed for considering the state of the nation, with regard to the treaties of peace and commerce. The motion was seconded by the earl of Cla∣rendon; and the thirteenth day of April fixed for this purpose. In the mean time, baron Schutz demanded of the chancellor a writ for the electoral prince of Hanover, to sit in the house of peers as duke of Cambridge, intimating, that his design was to reside in England. The writ was granted with reluctance; but the prince's design of coming to England was so disagreeable to the queen, that she signified her disapprobation of such a step, in a letter to the princess Sophia. She observed, that such a method of proceeding would be dangerous to the succession itself, which was not secure any other way, than as the prince who was in actual possession of the throne maintained her authority and prero∣gative: she said, a great many people in England were seditiously disposed; so she left her to judge, what tumults they might be able to raise should they have a pretext to begin a commotion: she therefore persuaded herself, that her aunt would not consent to any thing which might disturb the repose of her and her subjects. At the same time she wrote a letter to the electoral prince, complain∣ing, that he had formed such a resolution without first knowing her sentiments on the subject; and telling him plainly, that nothing could be more dangerous to the tranquillity of her dominions, to the right of succession in the Hanoverian line, or more disagreeable to her, than such conduct at this juncture. A third letter was written to the elector his father; and the treasurer took this opportu∣nity to assure that prince of his inviolable attachment to the family of Ha∣nover.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="39" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The Whig lords were dissatisfied with the queen's answer to their address concerning the pretender; and they moved for another address on the same subject, which was resolved upon, but never presented. They took into consideration the treaties of peace and commerce, to which many exceptions
<PB N="422" REF="4250"/>
were taken; and much sarcasm was expended on both sides of the dispute; but, at length, the majority carried the question in favour of an address, acknow∣ledging her majesty's goodness, in delivering them by a safe, honourable, and advantageous peace with France, from the burden of a consuming land-war, un∣equally carried on, and become at last impracticable. The house of commons concurred in this address, after having voted, That the protestant succession was out of danger; but these resolutions were not taken without violent opposition, in which general Stanhope, Mr. Lechmere, and Mr. Walpole, chiefly distin∣guished themselves. The letters which the queen had written to the electoral house of Hanover were printed and published in England, with a view to in∣form the friends of that family, of the reasons which prevented the duke of Cambridge from executing his design of residing in Great Britain. The queen considered this step as a personal insult, as well as an attempt to prejudice her in the opinions of her subjects: she therefore ordered the publisher to be taken into custody. At this period the princess Sophia died, in the eighty-fourth year of her age; and her death was intimated to the queen by baron Bothmar, who arrived in England with the character of envoy-extraordinary from the elec∣tor of Hanover. This princess was the fourth and youngest daughter of Fre∣derick elector palatine, king of Bohemia, and Elizabeth, daughter of king James I. of England. She enjoyed from nature an excellent capacity, which was finely cultivated; and was in all respects one of the most accomplished prin∣cesses of the age in which she lived. At her death the court of England ap∣peared in mourning; and the elector of Brunswick was prayed for by name in the liturgy of the church of England. On the twelfth day of May Sir William Wyndham made a motion for a bill to prevent the growth of schism, and for the further security of the church of England as by law established. The de∣sign of it was to prohibit dissenters from teaching in schools and academies. It was accordingly prepared, and eagerly opposed in each house as a species of persecution. Nevertheless, it made its way through both, and received the royal assent; but the queen dying before it took place, this law was rendered ineffectual.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="40" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XL.</HEAD>
<P>Her majesty's constitution was now quite broken: one fit of sickness succeeded another; and what completed the ruin of her health was the anxiety of her mind, occasioned partly by the discontents which had been raised and fomented by the enemies of her government; and partly by the dissensions among her ministers, which were now become intolerable. The council-chamber was turned into a scene of obstinate dispute and bitter altercation. Even in the queen's presence, the treasurer and secretary did not abstain from mutual obloquy and reproach. Oxford advised moderate measures, and is said to have made advances towards a reconciliation with the leaders of the Whig party. As he foresaw it would soon be their turn to domineer, such precautions were necessary for his own safety. Bolingbroke affected to set the Whigs at de∣fiance: he professed a warm zeal for the church: he soothed the queen's inclina∣tions with the most assiduous attention. He and his coadjutrix insinuated, that the treasurer was biassed in favour of the dissenters, and even, that he acted as a spy for the house of Hanover. In the midst of these disputes and commotions the Jacobites were not idle. They flattered themselves, that the queen in secret
<PB N="423" REF="4260"/>
favoured the pretensions of her brother; and they depended upon Bolingbroke's attachment to the same interest. They believed the same sentiments were che∣rished by the nation in general. They held private assemblies both in Great Britain and Ireland. They concerted measures for turning the dissensions of the kingdom to the advantage of their cause. They even proceeded so far as to inlist men for the service of the pretender. Some of these practices were discovered by the earl of Wharton, who did not fail to sound the alarm. A proclamation was immediately published, promising a reward of five thousand pounds for apprehending the pretender whenever he should land or attempt to land in Great Britain. The commons voted an address of thanks for the pro∣clamation; and assured her majesty, that they would chearfully aid and assist her, by granting the sum of an hundred thousand pounds as a further reward to any who should perform so great a service to her majesty and her kingdoms. The lords likewise presented an address on the same subject. Lord Bolingbroke proposed a bill, decreeing the penalties of high-treason against those who should list or be inlisted in the pretender's service. The motion was approved, and the penalty extended to all those who should list or be inlisted in the service of any foreign prince or state, without a licence under the sign manual of her majesty, her heirs, or successors.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="41" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLI.</HEAD>
<P>On the second day of July the lords took into consideration the treaty of commerce with Spain; and a good number of merchants being exa∣mined at the bar of the house, declared, that unless the explanations of the third, fifth, and eighth articles, as made at Madrid after the treaty was signed, were rescinded, they could not carry on their commerce without losing five and twenty per cent. After a long debate, the house resolved to address the queen for all the papers relating to the negotiation of the treaty of commerce with Spain, with the names of the persons who advised her majesty to that treaty. To this address she replied, that understanding the three explanatory articles of the treaty were not detrimental to the trade of her subjects, she had con∣sented to their being ratified with the treaty. The earl of Wharton represented, that if so little regard was shewn to the addresies of that august assembly to the sovereign, they had no business in that house. He moved for a remon∣strance to lay before her majesty, the insuperable difficulties that attended the Spanish trade on the footing of the late treaty; and the house agreed to his motion. Another member moved, That the house should insist on her majesty's naming the persons who advised her to ratify the three explanatory articles. This was a blow aimed at Arthur Moore, a member of the lower house, whom lord Bolingbroke had consulted on the subject of the treaty. He was screened by the majority in parliament; but, a general court of the South-sea company resolved, upon a complaint exhibited by captain Johnson, that Arthur Moore, while a director, was privy to, and encouraged the design of carrying on a clan∣destine trade, to the prejudice of the corporation, contrary to his oath, and in breach of the trust reposed in him: that, therefore, he should be declared inca∣pable of being a director of, or having any employment in this company. The queen had reserved to herself the quarter part of the assento-contract, which she now gave up to the company, and received the thanks of the upper house; but, she would not discover the names of those who advised her to ratify the
<PB N="424" REF="4270"/>
explanatory articles. On the ninth day of July she thought proper to put an and to the session, with a speech on the usual subjects. After having assured them, that her chief concern was to preserve the protestant religion, the liberty of her subjects, and to secure the tranquillity of her kingdoms, she concluded in these words, <Q>“But, I must tell you plainly, that these desirable ends can never be obtained, unless you bring the same dispositions on your parts; un∣less all groundless jealousies which create and foment divisions among you, be layed aside; and unless you shew the same regard for my just prerogative, and for the honour of my government, as I have always expressed for the rights of my people.”</Q></P>

<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>After the peace had thus received the sanction of the parliament, the ministers being no longer restrained by the tie of common danger, gave a loose to their mutual animosity. Oxford wrote a letter to the queen, containing a detail of the public transactions; in the course of which he endeavoured to justify his own conduct, and expose the turbulent and ambitious spirit of his rival. On the other hand, Bolingbroke charged the treasurer with having in∣vited the duke of Marlborough to return from his voluntary exile; and main∣tained a private correspondence with the house of Hanover. The duke of Shrewsbury likewise complained of his having presumed to send orders to him in Ireland, without the privity of her majesty and the council. In all probabi∣lity, his greatest crime was, his having given umbrage to the favourite lady Masham. Certain it is, on the twenty-seventh day of July a very acrimonious dialogue passed between that lady, the chancellor, and Oxford, in the queen's presence. The treasurer affirmed he had been wronged, and abused by lies and misrepresentations; but, he threatened vengeance, declaring he would leave some people as low as he had found them when they first attracted his notice. In the mean time he was removed from his employment; and Bolingbroke seemed to triumph in the victory he had obtained. He layed his account with being admitted as chief minister into the administration of affairs; and is said to have formed the design of a coalition with the duke of Marlborough, who at this very time embarked at Ostend for England. Probably, Oxford had tried to play the same game, but met with a repulse from the duke, on account of the implacable resentment which the dutchess had conceived against that minister.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="43" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XLIII.</HEAD>
<P>Whatever schemes might have have been formed, the fall of the treasurer was so sudden, that no plan was established for supplying the vacancy occasioned by his disgrace. The confusion that incessantly ensued at court, and the fatigue of attending a long cabinet-council on this event, had such an effect upon the queen's spirits and constitution, that she declared she should not outlive it, and was immediately seized with a lethargic disorder. Notwithstand∣ing all the medicines which the physicians could prescribe, the distemper gained ground so fast, that next day, which was the thirtieth of July, they despaired of her life. Then the committee of the council assembled at the Cockpit, ad∣journed to Kensington. The dukes of Somerset and Argyle, informed of the desperate situation in which she lay, repaired to the palace; and, without being summoned, entered the council-chamber. The members were surprised at their appearance; but the duke of Shrewsbury thanked them for their readiness to
<PB N="425" REF="4280"/>
give their assistance at such a critical juncture; and desired they would take their places. The physicians having declared, that the queen was still sensible, the council unanimously agreed, to recommend the duke of Shrewsbury as the fittest person to fill the place of lord-treasurer. When this opinion was intimated to the queen, she said, they could not have recommended a person she liked better than the duke of Shrewsbury. She delivered to him the white staff, bidding him use it for the good of her people. He would have returned the lord-cham∣berlain's staff; but she desired he would keep them both: so that he was at one time possessed of the three greatest posts of the kingdom, under the titles of lord-treasurer, lord-chamberlain, and lord-lieutenant of Ireland. No noble∣man in England better deserved such distinguishing marks of his sovereign's fa∣vour. He was modest, liberal, disinterested, and a warm friend to his country. Bolingbroke's ambition was defeated by the vigour which the dukes of Somer∣set and Argyle exerted on this occasion. They proposed, that all privy-coun∣sellors in or about London, should be invited to attend, without distinction of party. The motion was approved; and the lord Somers, with many other Whig members, repaired to Kensington. The council being thus reinforced, began to provide for the security of the kingdom. Orders were immediately dispatched to four regiments of horse and dragoons quartered in remote coun∣ties, to march up to the neighbourhood of London and Westminster. Seven of the ten British Battalions in the Netherlands, were directed to embark at Ostend for England, with all possible expedition: an embargo was layed upon all shipping; and directions given for equipping all the ships of war that could be soonest in a condition for service. They sent a letter to the elector of Bruns∣wick, signifying, that the physicians had despaired of the queen's life; inform∣ing him of the measures they had taken; and desiring he would, with all con∣venient speed, repair to Holland, where he should be attended by a British squa∣dron, to convey him to England, in case of her majesty's decease. At the same time they dispatched instructions to the earl of Strafford, to desire the states-general would be ready to perform the guaranty of the protestant succession. The he∣ralds at arms were kept in waiting, with a troop of horse-guards, to proclaim the new king as soon as the throne should become vacant. Precautions were taken to secure the sea-ports; to overawe the Jacobites in Scotland; and the command of the fleet was bestowed upon the earl of Berkeley.</P>

<P>The queen continued to doze in a lethargic insensibility, with very short intervals, till the first day of August in the morning, when she expired, in the fiftieth year of her age, and in the thirteenth of her reign. Anne Stuart, queen of Great Britain, was in her person of the middle size, well proportioned. Her hair was of a dark brown colour, her complexion ruddy, her features were regular, her countenance was rather round than oval, and her aspect more comely than majestic. Her voice was clear and melodious, and her presence engaging. Her capacity was naturally good, but not much cultivated by learning; nor did she exhibit any marks of extraordinary genius, or personal ambition. She was certainly deficient in that vigour of mind by which a prince ought to preserve his independence, and avoid the snares and fetters of syco∣phants and favourites: but, whatever her weakness in this particular might have been, the virtues of her heart were never called in question. She was a
<PB N="426" REF="4290"/>
pattern of conjugal affection and fidelity, a tender mother, a warm friend, an indulgent mistress, a munificent patron, a mild and merciful prince, during whose reign no subject's blood was shed for treason. She was zealously attached to the church of England from conviction rather than from prepossession, un∣affectedly pious, just, charitable, and compassionate. She felt a mother's fond∣ness for her people, by whom she was universally beloved with a warmth of af∣fection which even the prejudice of party could not abate. In a word, if she was not the greatest, she was certainly one of the best and most unblemished sovereigns that ever sat upon the throne of England; and well deserved the expressive, though simple epithet, of "The good queen Anne."</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>IT may be necessary to remind the reader of the state of party at this important juncture. The Jacobites had been fed with hopes of seeing the succession altered by the earl of Oxford. These hopes he had conveyed to them in a distant, undeterminate, and mysterious manner, without any other view than that of preventing them from taking violent measures to embarrass his administration. At least, if he actually entertained at one time any other design, he had, long before his disgrace, layed it wholly aside, pro∣bably from an apprehension of the danger with which it must have been at∣tended; and seemed bent upon making a merit of his zeal for the house of Hanover: but his conduct was so equivocal and unsteady, that he ruined himself in the opinion of one party, without acquiring the confidence of the other. The friends of the pretender derived fresh hopes from the ministry of Bolingbroke. Though he had never explained himself on this subject, he was supposed to favour the heir of blood, and known to be an implacable enemy to the Whigs, who were the most zealous advocates for the protestant succession. They promised themselves much from his affection, but more from his re∣sentment; and they believed the majority of the Tories would join them on the same maxims. All Bolingbroke's schemes of power were defeated by the promotion of the duke of Shrewsbury to the office of treasurer; and all his hopes blasted by the death of the queen, on whose personal favour he de∣pended. The resolute behaviour of the dukes of Somerset and Argyle, to∣gether with the diligence and activity of a council in which the Whig interest had gained the ascendency, completed the confusion of the Tories, who found themselves without a head, divided, distracted, and irresolute. Upon recol∣lection, they saw nothing so eligible as silence and submission to those measures which they could not oppose with any prospect of success. They had no other objection to the succession in the house of Hanover, but the fear of seeing the Whig faction once more predominant: yet they were not without hope that their new sovereign, who was reputed a prince of sagacity and experience, would cultivate and conciliate the affection of the Tories, who were the land∣holders and proprietors of the kingdom, rather than declare himself the head of a faction which leaned for support on those who were enemies to the church and monarchy, on the bank and the monied-interest, raised upon usury and maintained by corruption. In a word, the Whigs were elated and overbearing; the Tories abashed and humble; the Jacobites eager, impatient, and alarmed at a juncture which with respect to them was truly critical.</P>

<P>The queen had no sooner resigned her last breath, than the privy-council met, and the archbishop of Canterbury, the lord chancellor, and the Hanoverian resident Kreyenberg, produced the three instruments in which the
<PB N="429" REF="4320" MS="y"/>
elector of Brunswick had nominated the persons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These were the dukes of Shrewsbury, So∣merset, Bolton, Devonshire, Kent, Argyle, Montrose, Roxburgh; the earls of Pomfret, Anglesey, Carlile, Nottingham, Abingdon, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Scar∣borough, Orford, lord viscount Townshend, the lords Hallifax and Cowper.</NOTE> to be added as lords justices to the seven great officers of the realm. Orders were immediately issued for proclaiming king George, in England, Scotland, and Ireland. The regency appointed the earl of Dorset to carry to Hanover the intimation of his majesty's accession, and attend him in his journey to England. They sent the general officers in whom they could confide, to their respective posts; they reinforced the garrison of Portsmouth; and appointed Mr. Addison their secretary; while Bolingbroke was obliged to stand at the door of the council-chamber with his bag and papers, and underwent every species of mortification. On the whole, king George ascended the throne of Great Britain in the fifty-fifth year of his age, without the least opposition, tumult, or sign of popular discontent; and the unprejudiced part of the nation was now fully persuaded that no design had ever been concerted by queen Anne and her ministry in favour of the pretender. The mayor of Oxford received a letter, requiring him to proclaim the pretender. This being communicated to the vice-chancellor, a copy of it was immediately transmitted to Mr. secretary Bromley, member of parliament for the university; and the vice-chancellor offered a reward of one hundred pounds to any person who should discover the author. It was either the production of some lunatic, or a weak contrivance to fix an odium on that venerable body.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament having assembled, pursuant to the act which regulated the succession, the lord chancellor, on the fifth day of August, made a speech to both houses in the name of the regency. He told them, that the privy-council, appointed by the elector of Brunswick, had proclaimed that prince under the name of king George, as the lawful and rightful sovereign of these kingdoms; and that they had taken the necessary care to maintain the public peace. He observed, that the several branches of the public revenue were ex∣pired by the demise of her late majesty; and recommended to the commons the making such provision in that respect as might be requisite to support the honour and dignity of the crown. He likewise expressed his hope, that they would not be wanting in any thing that might conduce to the establishing and advancing of the public credit. Both houses immediately agreed to ad∣dresses, containing the warmest expressions of duty and affection to their new sovereign, who did not fail to return such answers as were very agreeable to the parliament of Great Britain. In the mean time, the lower house prepared and passed a bill, granting to his majesty the same civil-list which the queen had en∣joyed; with additional clauses for the payment of arrears due to the troops of Hanover, which had been in the service of Great Britain; and for a reward of one hundred thousand pounds, to be payed by the treasury to any person who should apprehend the pretender in landing, or in attempting to land in any part of the British dominions. Mr. Craggs, who had been dispatched to Ha∣nover before the queen died, returning on the thirteenth day of August, with letters from the king to the regency, they went to the house of peers; and the chancellor, in another speech to both houses, intimated his majesty's great sa∣tisfaction in the loyalty and affection which his people had universally expressed at his accession. Other addresses were voted on this occasion. The commons

<P>Mr. Prior having notified the queen's death to the court of Versailles, Lewis declared, that he would inviolably maintain the treaty of peace con∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uded at Utrecht, particularly with relation to the settlement of the British crown in the house of Hanover.

The chevalier de St. George no sooner re∣ceived the news of the queen's death, than he posted to Versailles, where he was given to un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rstand, that the king of France expected he should quit his territories immediately; and he was accordingly obliged to return to Lor∣rain. By this time Mr. Murray had arrived in England from Hanover, with notice that the king had deferred his departure for some days. He brought orders to the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gency to prepare a patent for creating the prince-royal, prince of Wales; and for removing lord Bolingbroke from his post of secretary. The seals were taken from this minister by the dukes of Shrewsbury and Somerset, and lord Cowper, who at the same time sealed up all the doors of his office.</P>

<P>King George having vested the government of his German dominions in a council, headed by his brother prince Ernest, set out with the electoral prince from Herenhausen on the thirty-first day of August; and in five days arrived at the Hague<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> where he conf<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rred with the states-general. On the sixteenth day of September he embarked at Orange-Polder, under convoy of an English and Dutch squadron, commanded by the earl of Berkeley; and next day arrived at the Hope. In the afternoon the yacht sailed up the river; and his majesty, with the prince, were landed from a barge at Greenwich, about six in the evening. There he was received by the duke of Northumberland, captain of the life∣guard, and the lords of the regency. From the landing-place he walked to h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use in the Park, accompanied by a great number of the nobility, and other persons of distinction, who had the honour to kiss his hand, as they ap∣proached. When he retired to his bed-chamber, he sent for those of the no∣bility who had d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stinguished themselves by their zeal for his succession: but the duke of Or<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ond, the lord chancellor, and lord Trevor, were not of the num∣ber. Next morning, the earl of Oxford presented himself with an air of con∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dence, as if he had expected to receive some particular mark of his majesty's favour. But he had the mortification to remain a considerable time undistin∣guished among the croud; and then was permitted to kiss the king's hand, without being honoured with any other notice. On the other hand, his ma∣jesty expressed uncommon regard for the duke of Marlborough, who had lately arrived in England, as well as for all the leaders of the Whig party.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>It was the misfortune of this prince, as well as a very great prejudice to the nation, that he had been misled into strong prepossessions against the Tories, who constituted such a considerable part of his subjects. They were now excluded from all share of the royal favour, which was wholly engrossed
<PB N="431" REF="4340"/>
by their enemies; and these early marks of aversion, which he was at no pains to conceal, alienated the minds of many from his person and government, who would otherwise have served him with fidelity and affection. An instan∣taneous and total change was effected in all offices of honour and advantage. The duke of Ormond was dismissed from his command, which the king re∣stored to the duke of Marlborough, whom he likewise appointed colonel of the first regiment of foot-guards, and master of the ordnance. The great seal was given to lord Cowper; the privy-seal to the earl of Wharton; the government of Ireland to the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Devonshire was made steward of the houshold; lord Townshend and Mr. Stanhope were appointed secretaries of state: the post of secretary for Scotland was bestowed upon the duke of Montrose. The duke of Somerset was constituted master of the horse; the duke of St. Alban's captain of the band of pensioners; and the duke of Argyle commander in chief of the forces in Scotland. Mr. Pulteney became secretary at war; and Mr. Walpole, who had already undertaken to manage the house of commons, was gratified with the double place of pay∣master to the army and to Chelsea-hospital. A new privy-council was ap∣pointed, and the earl of Nottingham declared president: but all affairs of consequence were concerted by a cabinet-council or junto, composed of the duke of Marlborough, the earls of Nottingham and Sunderland, the lords Hallifax, Townshend, Somers, and general Stanhope. The regency had already re∣moved Sir Constantine Phipps and the archbishop of Armagh from the office of lords justices in Ireland, and filled their places in the regency of that kingdom with the archbishop of Dublin and the earl of Kildare. Allan Broderick was appointed chancellor; another privy-council was formed, and the duke of Ormond was named as one of the members. The treasury and admiralty were put into commission; all the governments were changed; and, in a word, the whole nation was delivered into the hands of the Whigs. At the same time, the prince-royal was declared prince of Wales, and took his place in coun∣cil. The king was congratulated on his accession in addresses from the two universities, and all the cities and corporations of the kingdom. He expressed particular satisfaction at these expressions of loyalty and affection. He de∣clared in council, his firm purpose to support and maintain the churches of England and Scotland as they were by law established. This he was of opi∣nion might be effectually done without impairing the toleration allowed by law to protestant dissenters, and so necessary to the trade and riches of the king∣dom: and he moreover assured them, he would earnestly endeavour to render property secure; the good effects of which were no where so clearly seen as in this happy nation. Before the coronation he created some new peers, and others were promoted to higher titles <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James lord Chandois was created earl of Caernarvon; Lewis lord Rockingham, earl of that name; Charles lord Ossulton, earl of Tan∣kerville; Charles lord Hallifax, earl of Hallifax; Heneage lord Guernsey, earl of Aylesford; John lord Hervey, earl of Bristol; Thomas lord Pel∣ham, earl of Clare; and Henry earl of Tho∣mond, in Ireland, viscount Tadcaster; James viscount Castleton in Ireland, baron S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nderson; Bennet lord Sherard in Ireland, baron of Har∣borough; Gervase lord Pierrepoint in Ireland, baron Pierrepoint in the county of Bucks; Henry Boyle, baron of Carleton, in the county of York; Sir Richard Temple, baron of Cobham; Henry Lord Paget, earl of Uxbridge.</NOTE>. On the twentieth day of October he was crowned in Westminster with the usual solemnity, at which the earl of Oxford

and lord Bolingbroke assisted <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the month of October<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the princess of Wales arrived in England, with her two eldest daughters the princesses Anne and Amelia.</NOTE>. On that very day, the university of Oxford, in full convocation, unanimously conferred the degree of doctor of civil law on Sir Constantine Phipps, with particular marks of honour and esteem. As the French king was said to protract the demolition of Dunkirk, Mr. Prior re∣ceived orders to present a memorial to hasten this work, and to prevent the canal of Mardyk<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from being finished. The answer which he received being deemed equivocal, this minister was recalled, and the earl of Stair appointed ambassador to the court of France, where he prosecuted this affair with un∣common vigour. About the same time, general Cadogan was sent as pleni∣potentiary to Antwerp, to assist at the barrier-treaty, there negotiated between the emperor and the states-general.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>Mean while, the number of the malcontents in England was con∣siderably increased by the king's attachment to the Whig faction. The cla∣mour of the church's being in danger was revived: jealousies were excited, seditious libels dispersed; and dangerous tumults raised in diferent parts of the kingdom. Birmingham, Bristol, Chippenham, Norwich, and Reading<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were filled with licentious riot. The party cry was, <Q>“Down with the Whigs. Sacheverel for ever.”</Q> Many gentlemen of the Whig faction were abused; magistrates in towns, and justices in the country, were reviled and insulted by the populace in the execution of their office. The pretender took this oppor∣tunity to transmit, by the French mail, copies of a printed manifesto, to the dukes of Shrewsbury, Marlborough, Argyle, and other noblemen of the first distinction. In this declaration, he mentioned the good intentions of his sister towards him, which were prevented by her deplorable death. He observed, that his people, instead of doing him and themselves justice, had proclaimed for their king a foreign prince, contrary to the fundamental and incontestable laws of hereditary right, which their pretended acts of settlement could never abrogate. These papers being delivered to the secretaries of state, the king refused an audience to the marquis de Lamberti, minister from the duke of Lorrain, on the supposition that this manifesto could not have been prepared or transmitted without the knowledge and countenance of his master. The mar∣quis having communicated this circumstance to the duke, that prince absolutely denied his having been privy to the transaction, and declared that the chevalier de St. George came into Lorrain by the directions of the French king, whom the duke could not disoblige without exposing his territories to invasion. Notwith∣standing this apology, the marquis was given to understand, that he could not be admitted to an audience until the pretender should be removed from the do∣minions of his master; he therefore quitted the kingdom without further hesi∣tation. Religion was still mingled in all political disputes. The high-church∣men complained that impiety and heresy daily gained ground, from the con∣nivance, or at least the supine negligence, of the Whig prelates. The lower house of convocation had, before the queen's death, declared that a book pu∣blished by Dr. Samuel Clarke, under the title of <Q>“The scripture-doctrine of the Trinity,”</Q> contained assertions contrary to the catholic faith. They sent up extracts from this performance to the bishops; and the doctor wrote an
<PB N="433" REF="4360"/>
answer to their objections. He was prevailed upon to write an apology, which he presented to the upper house; but apprehending it might be published se∣parately, and misunderstood, he afterwards delivered an explanation to the bishop of London. This was satisfactory to the bishops; but the lower house resolved, that it was no recantation of his heretical assertions. The disputes about the Trinity increasing, the archbishops and bishops received directions, which were published, for preserving unity in the church, the purity of the christian faith concerning the holy Trinity; and for maintaining the peace and quiet of the state. By these every preacher was restricted from delivering any other doctrine than what is contained in the holy scriptures with respect to the Trinity; and from intermeddling in any affairs of state or government. The like prohibi∣tion was extended to those who should write, harrangue, or dispute, on the same subjects.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament being dissolved, another was called by a very ex∣traordinary proclamation, in which the king complained of the evil designs of men disaffected to his succession; and of their having misrepresented his con∣duct and principles. He mentioned the perplexity of public affairs, the in∣terruption of commerce, and the heavy debts of the nation. He expressed his hope that his loving subjects would send up to parliament the fittest persons to redress the present disorders; and that, in the elections, they would have a particular regard to such as had expressed a firm attachment to the protestant succession when it was in danger. It does not appear that the protestant suc∣cession was ever in danger. How then was this declaration to be interpreted? People in general construed it into a design to maintain party-distinctions, and encourage the Whigs to the full exertion of their influence in the elections; into a renunciation of the Tories<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the first flash of that vengeance which afterwards was seen to burst upon the heads of the late ministry. When the earl of Strafford returned from Holland, all his papers were seized by an order from the secretary's office. Mr. Prior was recalled from France, and promised to discover all he knew relating to the conduct of Oxford's administration. Uncommon vigour was exerted on both sides in the elections; but, by dint of the monied-interest, which prevailed in most of the corporations through the kingdom, and the countenance of the ministry, which will always have weight with needy and venal electors, a great majority of Whigs was returned both in England and Scotland.</P>

<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>When this new parliament assembled on the seventeenth day of March at Westminster, Mr. Spencer Compton was chosen speaker of the commons. On the twenty-first day of the month, the king appeared in the house of lords, and delivered to the chancellor a written speech, which was read in presence of both houses. His majesty thanked his faithful and loving subjects for that zeal and firmness they had shewn in defence of the protestant succession, against all the open and secret practices which had been used to defeat it. He told them, that some conditions of the peace, essential to the security and trade of Great Britain, were not yet duly executed; and that the performance of the whole might be looked upon as precarious, until defensive alliances should be formed to guaranty the present treaties. He observed, that the pretender boasted of the assistance he expected in England, to repair his former disap∣pointments: that great part of the national trade was rendered impracticable:
<PB N="434" REF="4370"/>
that the public debts were surprisingly increased, even since the fatal cessation of arms. He gave the commons to understand, that the branches of the re∣venue formerly granted for the support of the civil government, were so far encumbered and alienated, that the produce of the funds which remained, and had been granted to him, would fall short of what was at first designed for maintaining the honour and dignity of the crown: that as it was his and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to see a prince of Wales who might in due time succeed him on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to see him blessed with many children; these circumstances would naturally occasion an expence to which the nation had not been for many years accustomed; and therefore he did not doubt but they would think of it with that affection which he had reason to hope from his commons. He desired that no unhappy divisions of parties might divert them from pursuing the common interest of their country. He declared that the established con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tution in church and state should be the rule of his government; and that the happiness, ease, and prosperity, of his people, should be the chief care of his life. He concluded with expressing his confidence, that with their assistance, he should disappoint the designs of those who would deprive him of that bles∣sing which he most valued, the affection of his people.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>Speeches, suggested by a vindictive ministry, better became the leader of an incensed party, than the father and sovereign of a divided people. This portended measures which it was the interest of the crown to avoid, and suited the temper of the majority in both houses, which breathed nothing but destruction to their political adversaries. The lords, in their address of thanks, professed their hope that his majesty, assisted by the parliament, would be able to recover the reputation of the kingdom in foreign parts, the loss of which they hoped to convince the world by their actions, was by no means to be imputed to the nation in general. The Tories said this was an invidious reflec∣tion, calculated to mislead and inflame the people; for the reputation of the kingdom had never been so high as at this very juncture. The commons pre∣tended astonishment to find that any conditions of the late peace should not yet be duly executed; and that care was not taken to form such alliances as might have rendered the peace not precarious. They declared their resolution to inquire into these fatal miscarriages; to trace out those measures whereon the pretender placed his hopes, and bring the authors of them to condign punish∣ment. These addresses were not voted without opposition. In the house of lords, the dukes of Buckingham and Shrewsbury, the earl of Anglesey, the archbishop of York, and other peers both secular and ecclesiastical, observed, that their address was injurious to the late queen's memory, and would serve only to increase those unhappy divisions that distracted the kingdom. In the lower house, Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Bromley, Mr. Shippen, general Ross, Sir Wyndham Whitelock, and other members, took exceptions to passages of the same nature, in the address which the commons had prepared. They were answered by Mr. Walpole, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. secretary Stanhope, who took occasion to declare, that notwithstanding the endeavours which had been used to prevent a discovery of the late mismanagements, by conveying away several papers from the secretary's office; yet the government had sufficient evidence left, to prove the late ministry the most corrupt that ever sat at the helm: that those matters would soon be layed before the house, when it would
<PB N="435" REF="4380"/>
appear, that a certain English general had acted in concert with, if not re∣ceived orders from, marechal de Villars. Lord Bolingbroke, who had hitherto appeared in public, as usual, with great serenity, and spoke in the house of lords with great freedom and confidence, thought it was now high time to con∣sult<NOTE PLACE="marg">Boyer. Torcy. Tindal. Bolingbroke. Voltaire.</NOTE> his personal safety. He accordingly withdrew to the continent, leaving a letter which was afterwards printed in his justification. In this paper he de∣clared he had received certain and repeated informations that a resolution was taken to pursue him to the scaffold: that if there had been the least reason to hope for a fair and open trial, after having been already prejudged unheard, by the two houses of parliament, he should not have declined the strictest ex∣amination. He challenged the most inveterate of his enemies to produce any one instance of criminal correspondence, or the least corruption in any part of the administration in which he was concerned. He said, if his zeal for the honour and dignity of his royal mistress, and the true interest of his country, had any where transported him to let slip a warm and unguarded expression, he hoped the most favourable interpretation would be put upon it. He affirmed that he had served her majesty faithfully and dutifully, in that especially which she had most at heart, relieving her people from a bloody and expen∣sive war; and that he had always been too much an Englishman to sacrifice the interest of his country to any foreign ally whatsoever.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1715.</NOTE> In the midst of all this violence against the late ministers, friends were not wanting to espouse their cause in the face of opposition; and even in some addresses to the king, their conduct was justified. Nay, some individuals had courage enough to attack the present administration. When a motion was made in the house of commons, to consider the king's proclamation for calling a new parliament, Sir William Whitelocke, member for the university of Oxford, boldly declared it was unprecedented and unwarrantable. Being called upon to explain himself, he made an apology. Nevertheless, Sir William rising up, said the proclamation was not only unprecedented and unwarrantable, but even of dangerous consequence to the very being of parliaments. When challenged to justify his charge, he observed, that every member was free to speak his thoughts. Some exclaimed, "The Tower, the Tower." A warm debate ensued: Sir William being ordered to withdraw, was accompanied by one hundred and twenty-nine members; and, those who remained in the house resolved, That he should be reprimanded by the speaker. He was accordingly re∣buked for having presumed to reflect on his majesty's proclamation; and made an unwarrantable use of the freedom of speech granted by his majesty. Sir William said, he was not conscious of having offered any indignity to his majesty, or of having been guilty of a breach of privilege: that he acquiesced in the deter∣mination of the house; but had no thanks to give to those gentlemen, who, under pretence of lenity, had subjected him to this censure.</P>

<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>On the ninth day of April general Stanhope delivered to the house of commons fourteen volumes, consisting of all the papers relating to the late nego∣tiations of peace and commerce, as well as to the cessation of arms; and moved, that they might be referred to a select committee of twenty persons, who should di∣gest the substance of them under proper heads, and report them, with their observa∣tions, to the house. One more was added to the number of this secret committee, which was chosen by ballot; and met that same evening. Robert Walpole,
<PB N="436" REF="4390"/>
original chairman, being taken ill, was succeeded in that place by Mr. Stan∣hope. The whole number was subdivided into three committees: to each a certain number of books was allotted; and they carried on the inquiry with great eagerness and expedition. Before this measure was taken Dr. Gilbert Burnet bishop of Sarum died of a pleuritic fever, in the seventy-second year of his age; and immediately after the committee had begun to act, the Whig party lost one of their warmest champions, by the death of the marquis of Wharton, a nobleman possessed of happy talents for the cabinet, the senate, and the com∣mon scenes of life; talents, which a life of pleasure and libertinism did not pre∣vent him from employing with surprising vigour and application. The com∣mittee of the lower house taking the civil list into consideration, examined several papers relating to that revenue. The Tories observed, that from the seven hundred thousand pounds granted annually to king William, the sum of fifty thousand pounds was allotted to the late queen when princess of Denmark; twenty thousand pounds to the duke of Glouceste<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and twice that sum as a dowry to James's queen: that near two hundred thousand pounds had been yearly deducted from the revenues of the late queen's civil list, and applied to other uses; notwithstanding which deduction, she had honourably maintained her family, and supported the dignity of the crown. In the course of the debate some warm altercation passed between lord Guernsey and one of the mem∣bers, who affirmed, that the late ministry had used the Whigs, and, indeed, the whole nation, in such a manner, that nothing they should suffer could be deemed a hardship. At length, the house agreed, that the sum of seven hundred thousand pounds clear should be granted for the civil-list during his majesty's life. A motion being made for an address against pensions, it was opposed by Mr. Walpole, and over-ruled by the majority: and the lords passed the bill for regulating the land-forces, with some amendments.</P>

<P>On the eighteenth day of May Sir John Norris sailed with a strong squadron to the Baltic, in order to protect the commerce of the nation, which had suffered from the king of Sweden, who caused all ships trading to those parts to be seized and consiscated. That prince had rejected the treaty of neutrality concerted by the allies for the security of the empire; and considered the English and Dutch as his enemies. The ministers of England and the states-general had presented memorials to the regency of Sweden; but finding no redress, they resolved to protect their trade by force of arms. After the Swedish gene∣ral Steenbock and his army were made prisoners, count Wellen concluded a treaty with the administrator of Holstein-Gottorp, by which the towns of Stetin and Wismar were sequestered into the hands of the king of Prussia; and the administrator engaged to secure them and all the rest of Swedish Pomerania, from the Poles and Muscovites; but, as the governor of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nia refused to comply with this treaty, those allies marched into the province, subdued the island of Rugen, and obliged Stetin to surrender. Then the governor consented to the sequestration, and payed to the Poles and Muscovites four hundred thou∣sand <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix-dollars, to indemnity them for the expence of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

treaty with the king of Denmark; by which the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, which had been taken from the Swede in his absence, were made over to his Britannic majesty, on condition that he should immediately declare war against Sweden. Accordingly he took possession of the dutchies in October; pub∣lished a declaration of war against Charles in his German dominions; and de∣tached six thousand Hanoverians to join the Danes and Prussians in Pomera∣nia. These allies reduced the islands of Rugen and Uledon, and attacked the towns of Wismar and Stralsund, from which last place Charles was obliged to retire in a vessel to Schonen. He assembled a body of troops, with which he proposed to pass the Sound upon the ice, and attack Copenhagen; but was dis∣appointed by a sudden thaw. Nevertheless, he refused to return to Stockholm, which he had not seen for sixteen years; but remained at Carlescroon, in order to hasten his fleet for the relief of Wismar.</P>

<P>The spirit of discontent and disaffection seemed to gain ground every day in England. Notwithstanding proclamations against riots, and orders of the justices for maintaining the peace, repeated tumults were raised by the mal∣contents in the cities of London and Westminster. Those who celebrated the anniversary of the king's birth-day with the usual marks of joy and festivity, were insulted by the populace; but, next day, which was the anniversary of the restoration, the whole city was lighted up with bonfires and illuminations, and ecchoed with the sound of mirth and tumultuous rejoicing. The people even obliged the life-guards who patroled through the streets, to join in the cry of "High church and Ormond!" and in Smithfield they burned a picture of king William. Thirty persons were imprisoned for being concerned in these riots. One Bournois, a schoolmaster, who affirmed that king George had no right to the crown, was tried and scourged through the city, with such severity, that in a few days he expired in the utmost torture. A frivolous incident served to increase the popular ferment. The shirts allowed to the first regiment of guards, com∣manded by the duke of Marlborough, were so coarse, that the soldiers could hardly be persuaded to wear them. Some were thrown into the king's and duke of Marlborough's gardens. A detachment, in marching through the city, produced them to the view of the shopkeepers and passengers, exclaiming, "These are the Hanover shirts." The court being informed of this clamour, ordered those new shirts to be burned immediately; but even this sacrifice, and an advertisement published by the duke of Marlborough in his own vindication, did not acquit that general of a suspicion that he was concerned in this mean species of peculation. A reward of fifty pounds was offered by the govern∣ment to any person that would discover one captain Wight, who, by an inter∣cepted letter, appeared to be disaffected to king George; and Mr. George Jeffries was seized at Dublin with a packet directed to Dr. Jonathan Swift, dean of St. Patrick's. Several treasonable papers being found in this packet, were transmitted to England: Jeffries was obliged to give bail for his appear∣ance; and Swift thought proper to abscond.</P>

<P>The house of lords, to demonstrate their abhorrence of all who should engage in conspiracies against their sovereign, rejected with indignation a petition presented to them, in behalf of Blackburn, Cassils, Bernarde, Meldrum, and Chambers, who had hitherto continued prisoners, for having conspired against the life of king William. On the ninth day of June, Mr.
<PB N="438" REF="4410"/>
Walpole, as chairman of the secret committee, declared to the house of commons, that the report was ready; and in the mean time moved, That a warrant might be issued by Mr. Speaker for apprehending several persons, particularly Mr. Matthew Prior and Mr. Thomas Harley, who being in the house, were imme∣diately taken into custody. Then he read the report, ranged under these diffe∣rent heads: the clandestine negotiation with monsieur Menager: the extraordi∣nary measures pursued to form the congress at Utrecht: the trifling of the French plenipotentiaries, by the connivance of the British ministers: the nego∣tiation about the renunciation of the Spanish monarchy: the fatal suspension of arms: the seizure of Ghent and Bruges, in order to distress the allies and favour the French: the duke of Ormond's acting in concert with the French general: the lord Bolingbroke's journey to France to negotiate a separate peace: Mr. Prior's and the duke of Shrewsbury's negotiations in France: the precipitate conclusion of the peace at Utrecht. The report being recited, Sir Thomas Hanmer moved, That the consideration of it should be adjourned to a certain day: and, that in the mean time the report should be presented for the perusal of the members: he was seconded by the Tories; a debate ensued; and the motion was rejected by a great majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="16" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>This point being gained, Mr. Walpole impeached Henry lord vis∣count Bolingbroke of high-treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. Hungerford declared his opinion, that nothing mentioned in the report, in relation to lord Bolingbroke, amounted to high-treason; and general Ross expressed the same sentiment. Then lord Coningsby standing up, <Q>“The wor∣thy chairman said he has impeached the hand, but I impeach the head: he has impeached the clerk, and I, the justice: he has impeached the scholar, and I, the master. I impeach Robert earl of Oxford and earl Mortimer, of high-treason, and other crimes and misdemeanours.”</Q> Mr. auditor Harley, the earl's brother, spoke in vindication of that minister. He affirmed he had done nothing but by the immediate command of his sovereign: that the peace was a good peace, and approved as such by two parliaments: and, that the facts charged to him in the report, amounted only to misdemeanours. Mr. au∣ditor Foley, the earl's brother-in-law, made a speech to the same purpose: Sir Joseph Jekyll, a staunch Whig, and member of the secret committee, expressed his doubt, whether they had sufficient matter or evidence to impeach the earl of high-treason. Nevertheless, the house resolved to impeach him, without a division. When he appeared in the house of lords next day, he found himself avoided by his brother peers, as infectious; and retired with signs of confusion. Prior and Harley having been examined by such of the committee as were jus∣tices of the peace for Middlesex, Mr. Walpole informed the house, that mat∣ters of such importance appeared in Prior's examination, that he was directed to move them for that member's being closely confined. He was accordingly cut off from all communication. On the twenty-first day of June Mr. secretary Stanhope impeached James duke of Ormond of high-treason, and other high crimes and misdemeanours. Mr. Archibald Hutchinson, one of the commis∣sioners of trade, spoke in favour of the duke. He expatiated on his noble birth and qualifications: he enumerated the great services performed to the crown and nation by his grace and his ancestors: he observed, that in the whole course of his late conduct, he had only obeyed the queen's commands; and affirmed, that all
<PB N="439" REF="4420"/>
the allegations against him, could not, in the rigour of the law, be construed into high treason. Mr. Hutchinson was seconded by general Lumley, who urged, that the duke of Ormond had on all occasions given signal proofs of his affection for his country, as well as of personal courage: that he had gene∣rously expended the best part of his estate by living abroad in a most noble and splendid manner, for the honour of his country. Sir Joseph Jekyll said, if there was room for mercy, he hoped it would be shewn to that noble, generous, and courageous peer, who had in a course of many years exerted those great accom∣plishments for the good and honour of his country: that, as the statute of Ed∣ward III. on which the charge of high-treason against him was to be grounded, had been mitigated by subsequent acts, the house ought not, in his opinion, to take advantage of that act against the duke, but only impeach him of high crimes and misdemeanours. General Ross, Sir William Wyndham, and the speakers of that party, did not abandon the duke in this emergency; but, all their arguments and eloquence were lost upon the other faction, by which they were greatly outnumbered; and the question being put, was carried for the im∣peachment of the duke of Ormond, who perceiving every thing conducted by a furious spirit of revenge, and that he could not expect the benefit of an im∣partial trial, consulted his own safety by withdrawing himself from the king∣dom. On the twenty-second day of June the earl of Strafford was likewise im∣peached by Mr. Aislaby, for having advised the fatal suspension of arms, and the seizing of Ghent and Bruges; and for having treated the most serene house of Hanover with insolence and contempt. He was also defended by his friends, but overpowered by his enemies.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>When the articles against the earl of Oxford were read in the house, a warm debate arose upon the eleventh, by which he was charged with having advised the French king in what manner Tournay might be gained from the states general. The question being put, Whether this article amounted to high-treason? Sir Robert Raymond, formerly sollicitor-general, maintained the ne∣gative, and was supported not only by Sir William Wyndham and the Tories, but also by Sir Joseph Jekyll, who said, it was ever his principle to do justice to every body from the highest to the lowest; and, that it was the duty of an ho∣nest man never to act by a spirit of party: that he hoped he might pretend to have some knowledge of the laws of the kingdom; and would not scruple to declare, that in his judgment, the charge in question did not amount to high-treason. Mr. Walpole answered with great warmth, that there were several persons both in and out of the committee, who did not in the least yield to that member in point of honesty; and who were superior to him in the knowledge of the laws, yet were satisfied, that the charge specified in the eleventh article amounted to high-treason. This point being decided against the earl, and the other articles ap∣proved by the house, the lord Coningsby, attended by the Whig members, im∣peached the earl of Oxford at the bar of the house of lords, demanding, at the same time, that he might be sequestered from parliament, and committed to safe custody. A motion was made, that the consideration of the articles might be adjourned. After a short debate the articles were read: then the Tory lords moved, that the judges might be consulted. This motion being rejected, an∣other was made, that the earl should be committed to safe custody: this occa∣sioned another debate, in which he himself spoke to the following purpose:
<PB N="440" REF="4430"/>
That the whole charge might be reduced to the negotiations and conclusion of the peace: that the nation wanted a peace, he said, no body would deny: that the conditions of this peace were as good as could be expected, confidering the backwardness and reluctancy which some of the allies shewed to come into the queen's measures: that the peace was approved by two successive parliaments: that he had no share in the affair of Tournay, which was wholly transacted by that unfortunate nobleman who had thought fit to step aside: that, for his own part, he always acted by the immediate directions and commands of the late queen, without offending against any known law; and being justified by his own conscience, was unconcerned for the life of an insignificant old man: that, if mi∣nisters of state, acting by the immediate commands of their sovereign, are afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings, it might one day or other be the case with all the members of that august assembly: that he did not doubt their lordships, out of regard to themselves, would give him an equi∣table hearing: and, that in the prosecution of the inquiry it would appear, he had merited not only the indulgence, but even the favour-of this government. <Q>“My lords (said he) I am now to take my leave of your lordships, and of this honourable house, perhaps for ever. I shall lay down my life with pleasure in a cause favoured by my late dear royal mistress. When I consider that I am to be judged by the justice, honour, and virtue of my peers, I shall ac∣quiesce, and retire with great content: and, my lords, God's will be done.”</Q> The duke of Shrewsbury having acquainted the house, that the earl was very much indisposed with the gravel, he was suffered to remain at his own house, in custody of the black-rod: in his way thither he was attended by a great multitude of people, crying, "High-church, Ormond, and Oxford for ever!" Next day he was brought to the bar, where he received a copy of the articles, and was allowed a month to prepare his answer. Though Dr. Mead declared, that if the earl should be sent to the Tower his life would be in danger; it was carried, on a division, that he should be conveyed thither on the sixteenth day of July. During the debate the earl of Anglesey observed, that these impeach∣ments were disagreeable to the nation; and that it was to be feared, such vio∣lent measures would make the sceptre shake in the king's hands. This expres∣sion threw the whole house in a flame. Some members cried, "To the Tower." Some, "To order." The earl of Sutherland declared, that if these words had been spoken in another place, he would have called the person that spoke them to an account: in the mean time he moved, that he should explain himself. Anglesey, dreading the resentment of the house, was glad to make an apo∣logy; which was accepted. The earl of Oxford was attended to the Tower by a prodigious concourse of people, who did not scruple to exclaim against his persecutors. Tumults were raised in Staffordshire and other parts of the king∣dom, against the Whig party, which had depressed the friends of the church and embroiled the nation. The house of commons presented an address to the king, desiring that the laws might be vigorously executed against the rioters. They prepared the proclamation-act, decreeing, that if any persons to the num∣ber of twelve, unlawfully assembled, should continue together one hour after having been required to disperse, by a justice of peace or other officer, and heard the proclamation against riots read in public, they should be deemed guilty of felony without benefit of the clergy.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When the king went to the house of peers on the twentieth day of July, to give the royal assent to this and some other bills, he told both houses, that a rebellion was actually begun at home; and, that the nation was threatened with an invasion from abroad. He therefore expected, that the commons would not leave the kingdom in a defenceless condition, but enable him to take such measures as should be necessary for the public safety. Addresses in the usual stile were immediately presented by the parliament, the convocation, the common-council, and lieutenancy of London, and the two universities, though that of Oxford, was received in the most contemptuous manner, the deputies being charged with disloyalty, on account of a fray which had happened be∣tween some recruiting officers and the scholars of the university. The addresses from the kirk of Scotland, and the dissenting ministers of London and Westmin∣ster, met with a much more gracious reception. The parliament forthwith passed an act, impowering the king to secure suspected persons, and to suspend the Habeas-corpus act in that time of danger. A clause was added to a money∣bill, offering the reward of one hundred thousand pounds to such as should seize the pretender dead or alive. Sir George Byng was sent to take the com∣mand of the sleet: general Erle repaired to his government of Portsmouth: the guards were encamped in Hyde-park: lord Irwin was appointed governor of Hull, in the room of brigadier Sutton, who, with lord Windsor, the gene∣rals Ross, Webb, and Stuart, were dismissed from the service. Orders were given for raising thirteen regiments of dragoons, and eight of infantry; and the trained-bands were kept in readiness to suppress tumults. In the midst of these transactions the commons added six articles to those exhibited against the earl of Oxford. Lord Bolingbroke was impeached at the bar of the house of lords by Mr. Walpole: bills being brought in to summon him and the duke of Ormond, to surrender themselves by the tenth of September, or in default thereof, to attaint them of high treason; they passed both houses, and received the royal assent. On the last day of August the commons agreed to the articles against the earl of Strafford, which being presented to the house of lords, the earl made a speech in his own vindication. He complained, that his papers had been seized in an unprecedented manner. He said, if he had in his letters or discourse, dropped any unguarded expressions against some foreign ministers, while he had the honour to represent the crown of Great Britain, he hoped they would not be accounted criminal by a British house of peers: he desired he might be allowed a competent time to answer the articles brought against him, and have duplicates of all the papers which had either been layed before the committee of secrecy, or remained in the hands of the government, to be used occasionally in his justification. This request was vehemently opposed by the leaders of the other party, until the earl of Ilay represented, that in all civilized nations, all courts of judicature, except the inquisition, allowed the persons arraigned all that was necessary for their justification: and, that the house of peers of Great-Britain ought not, in this case, to do any thing contrary to that honour and equity for which they were so justly renowned throughout all Fu∣rope. This observation made an impression upon the house, which resolved, that the earl should be indulged with copies of such papers as he might have occasion to use in his defence.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>On the third day of September Oxford's answer was delivered to the house of lords, who transmitted it to the commons. Mr. Walpole having
<PB N="442" REF="4450"/>
heard it read<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> said, it contained little more than a repetition of what had been suggested in some pamphlets and papers which had been published in vindica∣tion of the late ministry: that it was a false and malicious libel, laying upon his royal mistress the blame of all the pernicious measures he had led her into, against her own honour, and the good of his country: that it was likewise a libel on the proceedings of the commons, since he endeavoured to clear those persons who had already confessed their guilt by flight. After some debate the house resolved, That the answer of Robert earl of Oxford should be referred to the committee appointed to draw up articles of impeachment, and prepare evidence against the impeached lords: and, That the committee should prepare a replication to the answer. This was accordingly prepared, and sent up to the lords. Then the committee reported, That Mr. Prior had grosly prevaricated on his examination, and behaved with great contempt of their authority. The duke of Ormond and the lord viscount Bolingbroke having omitted to surren∣der themselves within the time limited, the house of lords ordered the earl∣marshal to raze out of the list of peers their names and armorial bearings. In∣v <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tories were taken of their personal estates; and the duke's atchievement, as knight of the garter, was taken down from St. George's chapel at Windsor. A man of candour cannot, without an emotion of grief and indignation, reflect upon the ruin of the noble family of Ormond, in the person of a brave, gene∣rous, and humane nobleman, to whom no crime was imputed, but that of hav∣ing obeyed the command of his sovereign. About this period the royal assent was given to an act for encouraging loyalty in Scotland. By this law, the te∣nant who continued peaceable while his lord took arms in favour of the preten∣der, was invested with the property of the lands he rented; and, on the other hand it was decreed, That the lands possessed by any person guilty of high∣treason<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should revert to the superior of whom they were held, and be consolidated with the superiority: and, That all intails and settlements of estates since the first day of August<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in favour of children, with a fraudulent intent to avoid the punishment of the law due to the offence of high-treason, should be null and void. It likewise contained a clause for summoning suspected persons, to find bail for their good behaviour, on pain of being denounced rebels. By virtue of this clause all the heads of the Jacobite clans<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and other supected persons, were summoned to Edinburgh; and those who did not appear were declared rebels.</P>

<P>By this time the rebellion was actually begun in Scotland. The dis∣sensions occasioned in that country by the union had never been wholly appeased. Even since the queen's death, addressses were prepared in different parts of Scot∣land against the union, which was deemed a national grievance; and the Ja∣cobites did not fail to encourage this aversion. Though their hopes of dissolving that treaty were baffled by the industry and other arts of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Revolutioners, who secured a majority of Whigs in parliament<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they did not lay aside their design of attempting something of consequence in favour of the pretender; but main∣tained a correspondence with the malcontents of England<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a great number of whom were driven by apprehension, hard usage, and resentment, into a system of politics which other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> they would not have espoused. The Tori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s finding themselves totally exclu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d from any share in the government and legislature, and exposed to the insolence and fury of a faction which they despised, began to
<PB N="443" REF="4460"/>
wish in earnest for a revolution. Some of them held private consultations, and communicated with the Jacobites, who conveyed their sentiments to the che∣valier de St. George, with such exaggerations as were dictated by their own eagerness and extravagance. They assured the pretender, that the nation was wholly disaffected to the new government; and indeed, the clamours, tumults, and conversation of the people in general, countenanced this assertion. They promised to take arms without further delay in his favour; and engaged that the Tories should join them at his first landing in Great-Britain. They, there∣fore, besought him to come over with all possible expedition, declaring, that his appearance would produce an immediate revolution. The chevalier resolved to take the advantage of this favourable disposition. He had recourse to the French king, who had always been the refuge of his family. Lewis favoured him in secret; and, notwithstanding his late engagements with England, cherished the ambition of raising him to the throne of Great Britain. He supplied him privately with sums of money, to prepare a small armament in the port of Havre, which was equipped in the name of Depine D'Anicaut: and without all doubt, his design was to assist him more effectually, in proportion as the English should manifest their attachment to the house of Stuart. The duke of Ormond and the lord Bolingbroke, who had retired to France, finding them∣selves condemned unheard, and attainted, engaged in the service of the cheva∣lier, and corresponded with the Tories of England.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>All these intrigues and machinations were discovered and communi∣cated to the court of London by the earl of Stair, who then resided as English ambassador at Paris. He was a nobleman of unquestioned honour and inte∣grity, generous, humane, discerning, and resolute. He had signalized himself by his valour, intrepidity, and other military talents, during the war in the Ne∣therlands; and he now acted in another sphere with uncommon vigour, vigi∣lance, and address. He detected the chevalier's scheme while it was yet in em∣bryo, and gave such early notice of it, as enabled the king of Great Britain to take effectual measures for defeating the design. All the pretender's interest in France expired with Lewis XIV. that ostentatious tyrant, who had for above half a century sacrificed the repose of Christendom to his insatiate vanity and am∣bition. At his death, which happened on the first day of September, the regency of the kingdom devolved to the duke of Orleans, who adopted a new system of politics, and had already entered into engagements with the king of Great-Britain. Instead of assisting the pretender, he amused his agents with mysterious and equivocal expressions, calculated to frustrate the design of the expedition. Nevertheless, the more violent part of the Jacobites in Great-Britain believed he was at bottom a friend to their cause; and depended upon him for succour. They even extorted from him a sum of money by dint of importunities, and some arms; but the vessel was shipwrecked, and the cargo lost upon the coast of Scotland.</P>

<DIV4 N="22" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>The partisans of the pretender had proceeded too far to retreat with safety; and therefore resolved to try their fortune in the field. The earl of Mar repaired to the Highlands, where he held consultations with the mar∣quisses of Huntley and Tullibardine, the earls Marischal and Southesk, the generals Hamilton and Gordon, with the chiefs of the Jacobite clans. Then he assembled three hundred of his own vassals, proclaimed the pretender at
<PB N="444" REF="4470"/>
Castletown, and set up his standard at Brae-Mar on the sixth day of September. By this time the earls of Home, Wigtoun, and Kinnoul, the lord Deskford, and Lockhart of Carnwath, with other persons suspected of disaffection to the present government, were committed prisoners to the castle of Edinburgh; and major-general Whetham marched with the regular troops which were in that kingdom to secure the bridge of Stirling. Before these precautions were taken two vessels had arrived at Arbroath from Havre, with arms, ammunition, and a good number of officers, who assured the earl of Mar, that the pretender would soon be with him in person. The death of Lewis XIV. struck a general damp upon their spirits; but they layed their account with being joined by a power∣ful body in England. The earl of Mar, by letters and messages, pressed the chevaller to come over without further delay. He, in the mean time, assumed the title of lieutenant-general of the pretender's forces, published a declaration, exhorting the people to take arms for their lawful fovereign; and this was fol∣lowed by a shrewd manifesto, explaining the national grievances, and assuring the people of redress. Some of his partisans attempted to surprise the castle of Edinburgh; but were prevented by the vigilance and activity of colonel Stuart, Leutenant-governor of that fortress. The duke of Argyle set out for Scotland as commander in chief of the forces in North-Britain: the earl of Sutherland set sail in the Queenborough ship of war for the North, where he proposed to raise his vassals for the service of the government; and many other Scottish peers returned to their own country, in order to signalize their loyalty to king George.</P>

<P>In England the practices of the Jacobites did not escape the notice of the ministry. Lieutenant colonel Paul was imprisoned in the Gate-house, for inlisting men in the service of the pretender. The titular duke of Powis was com∣mitted to the Tower: the lords Lansdown and Duplin were taken into custody; and a warrant was issued for apprehending the earl of Jersey. The king desired the consent of the lower house to seize and detain Sir William Wyndham, Sir John Packington, Mr. Edward Harvey of Combe, Mr. Thomas Forster, Mr. John Anstis, and Mr. Corbet Kynaston, who were members of the house, and sus∣pected of favouring the invasion. The commons unanimously agreed to the proposal, and presented an address, signifying their approbation. Harvey and Anstis were immediately secured. Forster, with the assistance of some popish lords, assembled a body of men in Northumberland: Sir John Packington being examined before the council, was dismissed for want of evidence. Mr. Kynaston absconded: Sir William Wyndham was seized at his own house in Somersetshire, by colonel Huske and a messenger, who secured his papers: he found means, however, to escape from them; but afterwards surrendered him∣self, and having been examined at the council-board, was committed to the Tower. His father-in-law the duke of Somerset offered to become bound for his appearance; and being rejected as bail, expressed his resentment so warmly, that the king thought proper to remove him from the office of master of the horse. On the twenty-first day of September the king went to the house of lords<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and passed the bills that were ready for the royal assent. Then the chancellor read his majesty's speech, expressing his acknowledgment and satis∣faction for the uncommon marks of their affection he had received; and the parliament adjourned to the sixth day of October.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>The friends of the house of Stuart were very numerous in the western counties, and began to make preparations for an insurrection. They had concealed some arms and artillery at Bath, and formed a design to surprise Bristol: but they were betrayed and discovered by the emissaries of the govern∣ment; which baffled all their schemes, and apprehended every person of con∣sequence suspected of attachment to that cause. The university of Oxford felt the rod of power on this occasion. Major-general Pepper, with a strong de∣tachment of dragoons, took possession of the city at day break, declaring he would use military execution on all students who should presume to appear without the limits of their respective colleges. He seized ten or eleven per∣sons, among whom was one Lloyd, a coffeeman; and made prize of some horses and furniture belonging to colonel Owen, and other gentlemen. With this booty he retreated to Abingdon; and Handasyde's regiment of foot was afterwards quartered in Oxford, to overawe the university. The ministry found it more difficult to suppress the insurgents in the northern counties. In the month of October, the earl of Derwentwater and Mr. Forster took the field with a body of horse, and being joined by some gentlemen from the borders of Scotland, proclaimed the pretender in Warkworth, Morpeth, and Alnwick. Their first design was to seize the town of Newcastle, in which they had many friends: but they found the gates shut upon them, and retired to Hexham; while general Carpenter having assembled a body of dragoons, resolved to march from Newcastle and attack them before they should be reinforced. The rebels retiring northward to Wooler, were joined by two hundred Scottish horse under the lord viscount Kenmuir, and the earls of Carnwath and Win∣toun, who had set up the pretender's standard at Moffat, and proclaimed him in different parts of Scotland. The rebels thus reinforced, advanced to Kelso, having received advice that there they would be joined by Mackintosh, who had crossed the Forth with a body of Highlanders.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>By this time the earl of Mar was at the head of ten thousand men well armed. He had secured the pass of the Tay at Perth, where his head∣quarters were established, and made himself master of the whole fruitful pro∣vince of Fife, and all the sea-coast on that side of the frith of Edinburgh. He selected two thousand five hundred men, commanded by brigadier Mackintosh, to make a descent upon the Lothian side, and join the Jacobites in that county, or such as should take arms on the borders of England. Boats were assembled for this purpose; and, notwithstanding all the precautions that could be taken by the king's ships in the frith, to prevent the design, above fifteen hundred chosen men made good their passage in the night, and landed on the coast of Lothian, having crossed an arm of the sea about sixteen miles broad, in open boats that passed through the midst of the king's cruisers. Nothing could be better concerted, or executed with more conduct and courage, than was this hazardous enterprize. They amused the king's ships with marches and coun∣termarches along the coast, in such a manner that they could not possibly know where they intended to embark. The earl of Mar, in the mean time, marched from Perth to Dumblaine, as if he had intended to cross the Forth at Stirling-bridge: but his real design was to divert the duke of Argyle from at∣tacking his detachment which had landed in Lothian. So far the scheme suc∣ceeded. The duke, who had assembled some troops in Lothian, returned to

They took the route to Jedburgh, where they resolved to leave Carpenter on one side, and penetrate into England by the western border. The Highlanders declared they would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit their own country; but were ready to execute the scheme proposed by the earl of Wintoun. Means however were found to prevail upon one half of them to advance, while the rest returned to the Highlands. At Bramp∣ton Forster opened his commission of general, which had been sent to him from the earl of Man, and proclaimed the pretender. They continued their march to Penrith, where the sheriff, assisted by the lord Lonsdale and the bishop of Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le, had assembled the whole posse comitatus of Cumberland, amounting to twelve thousand men, who dispersed with the utmost precipitation at the ap∣proach of the rebels. From Penrith, Forster proceeded by the way of Kendal and Lancaster to Preston, from whence Stanhope's regiment of dragoons, and another of militia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> immediately retired; so that he took possession of the place without resistance. General Wills marched against the enemy with six regiments of horse and dragoons, and one battalion of foot commanded by colonel Preston. They had advanced to the bridge of Ribble before Forster received intelligence of their approach. He forthwith began to raise barrica∣does, and put the place in a posture of defence. On the twelfth day of No∣vember, the town was briskly attacked in two different places: but the king's troops met with a very warm reception, and were repulsed with considerable loss. Next day general Carpenter arrived with a reinforcement of three regiments of dragoons; and the rebels were invested on all sides. The Highlanders de∣clared they would make a sally sword in hand, and either cut their way through the king's troops, or perish in the attempt; but they were over-ruled. Forster sent colonel Oxburgh with a trumpet to general Wills, to propose a capitulation. He was given to understand, that the general would not treat with rebels; but, in case of their surrendering at discretion, he would prevent his soldiers from putting them to the sword, until he should receive further orders. He granted them time to consider till next morning, upon their delivering the earl of Der∣wentwater and Mackintosh as hostages. When Forster submitted, this High∣lander declared, he could not promise that the S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs would s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>render in that
<PB N="447" REF="4500"/>
manner. The general desired him to return to his people, and he would forth∣with attack the town, in which case every man of them should be cut in pieces. The Scottish noblemen did not chuse to run that risque; and persuaded the Highlanders to accept the terms that were offered. They accordingly layed down their arms, and were put under a strong guard. All the noblemen and leaders were secured. Major Nairn, captain Lockhart, captain Shastoe, and ensign Erskine, were tried by a court-martial as deserters, and executed. Lord Charles Murray, son of the duke of Athole, was likewise condemned for the same crime, but reprieved. The common men were imprisoned at Chester and Liverpool: the noblemen and considerable officers were sent to London, conveyed through the streets, pinioned like malefactors, and committed to the Power and to Newgate.</P>

<P>The very day on which the rebels surrendered at Preston, was re∣markable for the battle of Dumblaine, fought between the duke of Argyle and the earl of Mar, who commanded the pretender's forces. This nobleman had retreated to his camp at Perth, when he understood the duke was returned from Lothian to Stirling. But being now joined by the northern clans under the earl of Seaforth, and those of the west commanded by general Gordon, who had signalized himself in the service of the czar of Muscovy, he resolved to pass the Forth, in order to join his southern friends, that they might march to∣gether into England. With this view he marched to Auchterardere, where he reviewed his army, and rested on the eleventh day of November. The duke of Argyle, apprised of his intention, and being joined by some regiments of dragoons from Ireland, determined to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblaine. On the twelfth day of the month he passed the Forth at Stirling, and encamped with his left at the village of Dumblaine, and his right towards Sheriff-moor. The earl of Mar advanced within two miles of his camp, and remained till day-break in order of battle; his army consisting of nine thousand effective men, cavalry as well as infantry. In the morning, the duke understanding they were in motion, drew up his forces, which did not exceed three thousand five hundred men, on the heights to the north-east of Dumblaine: but he was outslanked both on the right and left. The clans that formed part of the centre and right wing of the enemy, with Clanronald and Glengary at their head, charged the left of the king's army sword in hand, with such impetuosity that in seven minutes both horse and foot were totally routed with great slaughter; and general Whetham who commanded them, fled at full gallop to Stirling, where he declared that the royal army was to∣tally defeated. In the mean time, the duke of Argyle, who commanded in person on the right, attacked the left of the enemy, at the head of Stair's and Evans's dragoons, and drove them two miles before him, as far as the water of Allan: though in that space they wheeled about and attempted to rally ten times; so that he was obliged to press them hard, that they might not recover from their confusion. Brigadier Wightman followed, in order to sustain him with three battalions of infantry; while the victorious right wing of the rebels having pursued Whetham a considerable way, returned to the field and formed in the rear of Wightman, to the amount of five thousand men. The duke of Argyle returning from the pursuit, joined Wightman, who had faced about and taken possession of some inclosures and mud-walls, in expectation of being
<PB N="448" REF="4510"/>
attacked. In this posture both armies fronted each other till the evening, when the duke drew off towards Dumblaine, and the rebels retired to Ardoch, without mutual molestation. Next day, the duke marching back to the field of battle, carried off the wounded, with four pieces of cannon left by the enemy, and retreated to Stirling. Few prisoners were taken on either side: the number of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n might be about five hundred of each army, and both <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Claimed the victory. This battle was not so fatal to the Highlanders as the loss of Inverness, from which Sir John Mackenzie was driven by Simon Frazer lord Lovat, who, contrary to the principles he had latherto professed, secured this important post for the government; by which means a free com∣munication was opened with the north of Scotland, where the earl of Sutherland had raised a considerable body of vassals. The marquis of Huntley and the earl of Seaforth were obliged to quit the rebel army, in order to defend them own territories; and in a little time submitted to king George: a good num∣ber of the Frazers declared with their chief against the pretender: the marquis of Tullibardine withdrew from the army to cover his own country; and the cla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s seeing no likelihood of another action, began to disperse, according to custom.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The government was now in a condition to send strong rein∣forcements to Scotland. Six thousand men that were claimed of the states-general by virtue of the treaty, landed in England, and began their match for Edinburgh: general Cadogan set out for the same place, together with brigadier Petit and six other engineers; and a train of artillery was shipped at the Tower for that country, the duke of Argyle resolving to drive the earl of Mar out of Perth, to which town he had retired with the remains of his forces. The pretender having been amused with the hope of seeing the whole king∣dom of England rise up as one man in his behalf; and the duke of Ormond having made a fruitless voyage to the western coast, to try the disposition of the people, he was now convinced of the vanity of his expectation in that quar∣ter; and, as he knew not what other course to take, he resolved to hazard his person among his friends in Scotland, at a time when his affairs in that king∣dom were absolutely desperate. From Brittany he posted through part of France, in disguise, and embarking in a small vessel at Dunkirk, hired for that purpose, arrived on the twenty-second day of December at Peterhead, with six gentlemen in his retinue, one of whom was the marquis of Tinmouth, son to the duke of Berwick. He passed through Aberdeen incognito, to Fetterosse, where he was met by the earls of Mar and Marischal, and about thirty noble∣men and gentlemen of the first quality. Here he was solemnly proclaimed; his declaration, dated at Commercy, was printed and circulated through all the parts in that neighbourhood; and here he received addresses from the episcopal clergy, and the laity of that communion in the diocese of Aberdeen. On the fifth day of January, he made his public entry into Dundee; and on the seventh arrived at Scoon, where he seemed determined to stay until the ceremony of his coronation should be performed. From thence he made an excursion to Perth, where he reviewed his forces. Then he formed a regular council; and published proclamations; for a general thanksgiving, on account of his fare arrival; enjoining the ministers to pray for him in churches; establishing the currency of foreign coins; summoning the meeting of the convention of estates;
<PB N="449" REF="4520"/>
ordering all sensible men to repair to his standard, and fixing the twenty-third day of January for his coronation. He made a pathetic speech in a grand council, at which all the chiefs of his party assisted. Here they determined to abandon the enterprize, as the king's army was reinforced by the Dutch auxiliaries, and they themselves were not only reduced to a small number, but likewise destitute of money, arms, ammunition, forage, and provision: for the duke of Argyle had taken possession of Burntisland, and transported a de∣tachment to Fife, so as to cut off Mar's communication with that fertile county.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>Notwithstanding the severity of the weather, and a prodigious fall of snow which rendered the roads almost impassable, the duke, on the twenty-ninth of January, began his march to Dumblaine, and next day reached Tullibardine, where he received intelligence that the pretender and his forces had, on the preceding day, retired towards Dundee. He forthwith took pos∣session of Perth; and then began his march to Aberbrothick, in pursuit of the enemy. The chevalier de St. George being thus hotly pursued, was prevailed upon to embark on board of a small French ship that lay in the harbour of Montrose. He was accompanied by the earls of Mar and Melfort, the lord Drummond, lieutenant-general Bulkley, and other persons of distinction, to the number of seventeen. In order to avoid the English cruisers, they stretched over to Norway, and coasting along the German and Dutch shores, arrived in five days at Gravelin. General Gordon, whom the pretender had left com∣mander in chief of the forces, with the assistance of the earl Marischal, pro∣ceeded with them to Aberdeen, where he secured three vessels to sall north∣ward and take on board the persons who intended to make their escape to the continent. Then they continued their march through Strathspey and Strath∣down, to the hills of Badenoch, where the common people were quietly dis∣missed. This retreat was made with such expedition, that the duke of Argyle, with all his activity, could never overtake their rear-guard, which consisted of a thousand horse, commanded by the earl Marischal. Such was the issue of a rebellion that proved fatal to many noble families: a rebellion which, in all probability, would never have happened, had not the violent measures of a Whig ministry kindled such a flame of discontent in the nation, as encouraged the partizans of the pretender to hazard a revolt.</P>

<P>The parliament of Ireland, which met at Dublin on the twelfth day of November, seemed even more zealous, if possible, than that of England, for the present administration. They passed bills for recognizing the king's title; for the security of his person and government; for setting a price on the pre∣tender's head; and for attainting the duke of Ormond. They granted the supplies without opposition. All those who had addressed the late queen in favour of Sir Constantine Phipps, then lord chancellor of Ireland, were now brought upon their knees, and censured as guilty of a breach of privilege. They desired the lords-justices would issue a proclamation against the popish inhabitants of Limerick and Galway, who, presuming upon the capitulation signed by king William, claimed an exemption from the penalties imposed upon other papists. They engaged in an association against the pretender and all his abettors. They voted the earl of Anglesey an enemy to the king and kingdom, because he had advised the queen to break the army and prorogue
<PB N="450" REF="4530"/>
the late parliament; and they addressed the king to remove him from his council and service. The lords-justices granted orders for apprehending the earls of Antrim and Westmeath, the lords Natterville, Cahir, and Dillon, as persons suspected of disaffection to the government. Then they adjourned the two houses.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The king, in his speech to the English parliament, which met on the n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nth of January, told them he had reason to believe the pretender was landed in Scotland: he congratulated them on the success of his arms in suppressing the rebellion: on the conclusion of the barrier treaty between the emperor and the states-general, under his guaranty: on a convention with Spain that would deliver the trade of England to that kingdom, from the new impositions and hardships to which it was subjected in consequence of the late treaties. He likewise gave them to understand, that a treaty for renewing all former al∣liances between the crown of Great-Britain and the states-general, was almost concluded; and he assured the commons he would freely give up all the estates that should become forfeited to the crown by this rebellion, to be applied to∣wards defraying the extraordinary expence incurred on this occasion. The commons, in their address of thanks, declared that they would prosecute, in the most vigorous and impartial manner, the authors of those destructive counsels which had drawn down such miseries upon the nation. Their resolu∣tions were speedy, and exactly conformable to this declaration. They expelled Mr. Forster from the house. They forthwith impeached the earls of Der∣wentwater, Nithsdale, Carnwath, and Wintoun; the lords Widdrington, Kenmuir, and Nairn. These noblemen being brought to the bar of the house of lords, heard the articles of impeachment read on the tenth day of January, and were ordered to put in their answers on the sixteenth. The impeachments being lodged, the lower-house ordered a bill to be brought in for continuing the suspension of the habeas corpus act: then they prepared another to attaint the marquis of Tullibardine, the earls of Mar and Linlithgow, and lord John Drummond. On the twenty-first day of January, the king gave the royal assent to the bill for continuing the suspension of the habeas corpus act. He told the parliament that the pretender was actually in Scotland, heading the rebellion, and assuming the stile and title of king of these realms: he demanded of the commons such supply as might discourage any foreign power from as∣sisting the rebels. On Thursday the nineteenth day of January, all the im∣peached lords pleaded guilty to the articles exhibited against them, except the earl of Wintoun, who petitioned for a longer time, on various pretences. The rest received sentence of death on the ninth day of February, in the court erected in Westminster-hall, where the lord-chancellor Cowper presided as lord high-steward on that occasion. The countess of Nithsdale and lady Nairn threw themselves at the king's feet as he passed through the apartments of the palace<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and implored his mercy in behalf of their husbands: but their tears and intreaties produced no effect. The council resolved that the sentence should be executed, and orders were given for that purpose to the lieutenant of the Tower, and the sheriffs of London and Middlesex.</P>

<P>The countess of Derwentwater, with her sister, accompanied by the dutchesses of Cleveland and Bolton, and several other ladies of the first distinction, was introduced by the dukes of Richmond and St. Alban's, into
<PB N="451" REF="4540"/>
the king's bed-chamber, where she invoked his majesty's clemency for her unfortunate confort. She afterwards repaired to the lobby of the house of peers, attended by the ladies of the other condemned lords, and above twenty others of the same quality, and begged the intercession of the house: but no regard was payed to their petition. Next day, they petitioned both houses of parliament. The commons rejected their suit. In the upper house, the duke of Richmond delivered a petition from the earl of Derwentwater, to whom he was nearly related, at the same time declaring, that he himself should oppose his sollicitation. The earl of Derby expressed some compassion for the nume∣rous family of lord Nairn. Petitions from the rest were presented by other lords, moved with pity and humanity. Lord Townshend and others vehemently opposed their being read. The earl of Nottingham thought this indulgence might be granted: the house assented to his opinion; and agreed to an address, praying his majesty would reprieve such of the condemned lords as should de∣serve his mercy. To this petition the king answered, That on this and all other occasions, he would do what he thought most consistent with the dignity of his crown and the safety of his people. The earl of Nottingham, president of the council; his brother the earl of Aylesbury, chancellor of the dutchy of Lancaster; his son lord Finch, one of the lords of the treasury; his kinsman lord Guernsey, master of the jewel office, were altogether dismissed from his majesty's service. Orders were dispatched for executing the earls of Derwent∣water and Nithsdale, and the viscount of Kenmuir, immediately: the others were respited to the seventh day of March. Nithsdale made his escape in woman's apparel, furnished and conveyed to him by his mother. On the twenty-fourth day of February, Derwentwater and Kenmuir were beheaded on Tower-hill. The former was an amiable youth, brave, open, generous, hospitable, and humane. His fate drew tears from the spectators, and was a great misfortune to the country in which he lived. He gave bread to multi∣tudes of people whom he employed on his estate: the poor, the widow, and the orphan, rejoiced in his bounty. Kenmuir was a virtuous nobleman, calm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals Bolingbroke. Patten. Deb. in Parl. Tindal. State Trials.</NOTE> sensible, resolute, and resigned. He was a devout member of the English church; but the other died in the faith of Rome: both adhered to their poli∣tical principles. On the fifteenth day of March, Wintoun was brought to his trial, and being convicted, received sentence of death.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1716.</NOTE> When the king passed the land-tax bill, which was ushered in with a very extraordinary preamble, he informed both houses of the pretender's flight from Scotland. In the beginning of April, a commission for trying the rebels met in the court of common pleas, when bills of high treason were found against Mr. Forster, Mackintosh, and twenty of their confederates. Forster escaped from Newgate, and reached the continent in safety: the rest pleaded Not guilty, and were indulged with time to prepare for their trials. The judges appointed to try the rebels at Liverpool found a considerable number guilty of high-treason. Two and twenty were executed at Preston and Manchester: about a thousand prisoners submitted to the king's mercy, and petitioned for transportation. Pitts, the keeper of Newgate, being sus∣pected of having connived at Forster's escape, was tried for his life at the Old Bailey, and acquitted. Notwithstanding this prosecution, which ought to have doubled the vigilance of the jailors, brigadier Mackintosh, and several
<PB N="452" REF="4550"/>
other prisoners, broke from Newgate, after having mastered the keeper and turnkey, and dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rmed the centinel. The court proceeded with the trials of those that remained; a great number was found guilty; four or five were hanged, drawn, and quartered, at Tyburn; and among these William Paul, a clergyman, who, in his last speech, professed himself a true and sincere mem∣ber of the church of England, but not of the revolution schismatical church, whose bishops had abandoned the king, and shamefully given up their ecclesi∣astical rights, by submitting to the unlawful, invalid, lay-deprivations autho∣rised by the prince of Orange.</P>

<DIV4 N="34" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>Though the rebellion was extinguished, the flame of national dissatisfaction still continued to rage: the severities exercised against the rebels increased the general discontent: for now the danger was blown over, their humane p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons began to prevail. The courage and fortitude with which the condemned persons encountered the pains of death in its most dreadful form, prepossessed many spectators in favour of the cause by which those unhappy victims were animated. In a word, persecution, as usual, extended the heresy. The ministry perceiving this universal disaffection, and dreading the revolution of a new parliament, which might wrest the power from their faction, and retort upon them the violence of their own measures, formed a resolution equally odious and effectual to establish their administration. This was no other than a scheme to repeal the triennial act, and by a new law to extend the term of parliaments to seven years. On the tenth day of April, the duke of Devonshire represented, in the house of lords, that triennial elections served to keep up party-divisions; to raise and foment feuds in private families; to produce ruinous expences, and give occasion to the cabals and intrigues of foreign princes: that it became the wisdom of such an august assembly to ap∣ply proper remedies to an evil that might be attended with the most dangerous consequences, especiaily in the present temper of the nation, as the spirit of rebellion still remained unconquered. He therefore proposed a bill for enlarg∣ing the continuance of parliaments. He was seconded by the earls of Dorset and Rockingham, the duke of Argyle, the lord Townshend, and the other chiefs of that party. The motion was opposed by the earls of Nottingham, Abingdon, and Powlet. They observed, that frequent parliaments were re∣quired by the fundamental constitution of the kingdom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ascertained in the pra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of many ages: that the members of the lower house were chosen by the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ple for a certain term of years, at the expiration of which they could be no longer representatives of the people, who, by the parliament's protracting its own authority, would be deprived of the only remedy which they have against those who, through ignorance or corruption, betrayed the trust reposed in them: that the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asons in favour of such a bill were weak and frivolous: that, with resp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t to foreign alliances, no prince or state could reasonably de∣pend upon a people to defend their lib<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rties and interests, who should be thought to have given up so great a part of their own: nor would it be prudent in them to wish for a change in that constitution under which Europe had of late been so powerfully supported. On the contrary, they might be deterred from entering into any engagements with Great Britain, when in∣formed by the preamble of the bill, that the popish fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ion was so dangerous as to threaten <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>siruction to the government: they would apprehend that the
<PB N="453" REF="4560"/>
administration was so weak as to want so extraordinary a provision for its safety: that the gentlemen of Britain were not to be trusted: and, that the good affec∣tions of the people were restrained within the limits of the house of commons. They affirmed that this bill, far from preventing the expence of elections, would rather increase it, and encourage every practice of corruption; for, the value of a seat would always be in proportion to the duration of a parliament; and the purchase would rise accordingly. That a long parliament would yield a greater temptation, as well as a better opportunity to a vicious ministry, to corrupt the members, than they could possibly have when the parliaments were short and frequent: that the same reasons urged for passing the bill to continue this parliament for seven years, would be at least as strong, and by the conduct of the ministry, might be made much stronger before the end of that term, for continuing, and even perpetuating their legislative power, to the absolute subversion of the third estate of the realm. These arguments served only to form a decent debate, after which the bill for septennial parliaments passed by a great majority, though twenty peers entered a protest. It met with the same fate in the lower house, where many strong objections were started to no pur∣pose. They were represented as the effects of party-spleen; and, indeed, this was the great spring of action on both sides. The question for the bill was car∣ried in the affirmative; and in a little time it received the royal sanction.</P>

<P>The rebellion being utterly quelled, and all the suspected persons of consequence detained in safe custody, the king resolved to visit his German dominions, where he foresaw a storm gathering from the quarter of Sweden. Charles XII. was extremely exasperated against the elector of Hanover for hav∣ing entered into the confederacy against him in his absence, particularly for his having purchased the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, which constituted part of his dominions; and he breathed nothing but revenge against the king of Great Britain. It was with a view to avert this danger, or prepare against it, that the king now determined upon a voyage to the continent. But as he was restricted from leaving his British dominions, by the act for the further limi∣tation of the crown, this clause was repealed in a new bill that passed through both houses without the least difficulty. On the twenty-sixth day of June the king closed the session with a speech upon the usual topics, in which, however, he observed, that the numerous instances of mercy he had shewn, served only to encourage the faction of the pretender, whose partisans acted with such in∣solence and folly, as if they intended to convince the world, that they were not to be reclaimed by gentle methods. He intimated his purpose of visiting his dominions in Germany; and gave them to understand, that he had constituted his beloved son, the prince of Wales, guardian of the kingdom in his absence. About this period general Macartney, who had returned to England at the ac∣cession of king George, presented himself to trial for the murder of the duke of Hamilton. The deposition of colonel Hamilton was contradicted by two park∣keepers: the general was acquitted of the charge, restored to his rank in the army, and gratified with the command of a regiment. The king's brother, prince Ern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st bishop of Osnaburg, was created duke of York and Albany, and earl of Ulst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.

<P>On the seventh day of July the king embarked at Gravesend, lan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> on the ninth in Holland, through which he passed incognito to Hanover; and from thence set out for Pyrmont. His aim was, to secure his German do∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s from the Swe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and Great Britain from the pretender. These two princes had already begun to form a design, in conjunction, of invading his king∣dom. He knew the duke of Orleans resolved to ascend the throne of France, in case the young king, who was a sickly child, should die without male issue. The regent was not ignorant, that Philip of Spain would powerfully contest that succession<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> notwithstanding his renunciation; and he was glad of an oppor∣tunity to strengthen his interest by an alliance with the maritime powers of England and Holland. The king of England founded him on this subject, and found him eager to engage in such an association. The negotiation was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on by general <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adogan for England, the abbé du Bois for France, and the pensionary Heinsius for the states-general. The regent readily complied with all their demands. He engaged, that the pretender should immediately de∣part from Avignon to the other side of the Alps, and never return to Lorrain or France on any pretence whatsoever: that no rebellious subjects of Great Britain should be allowed to reside in that kingdom: and, that the treaty of Utrecht, with respect to the demolition of Dunkirk, should be fully executed to the satis∣faction of his Britannic majesty. The treaty contained a mutual guaranty of all the places possessed by the contracting powers; of the protestant succes∣sion on the throne of England, as well as of that of the duke of Orle∣ans to the crown of France; and a defensive alliance, stipulating the pro∣portion of ships and forces to be furnished to that power which should be dis∣turbed at home or invaded from abroad. The English people murmured at this treaty. They said, an unnecessary umbrage was given to Spain, with which the nation had great commercial connexions; and that, on pretence of an invasion, a body of foreign troops might be introduced to enslave the kingdom.</P>

<P>His majesty was not so successful in his endeavours to appease the king of Sweden. who refused to listen to any overtures until Bremen and Verden should be restored. These the elector of Hanover resolved to keep as a fair purchase; and he engaged in a confederacy with the enemies of Charles, for the maintenance of this acquisition. Mean while his rupture with Sweden was extremely prejudicial to the commerce of England, and had well nigh intailed upon the kingdom another invasion, much more formidable than that which had so lately miscarried. The ministers of Sweden resident at London, Paris, and the Hague, maintained a correspondence with the disaffected subjects of Great Britain. A scheme was formed for the Swedish king's landing on this island with a considerable body of forces, where he should be joined by the malcontents of the united kingdom. Charles re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished the enterprize, which flattered his ambition and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nor was it disagreeable to the czar of Muscovy, who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the elect<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s offer of joining the Swede against the Russians, provided he would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tify the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n and Verden. King George having re∣ceived intimation of the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e intrigues, returned to England towards the end of
<PB N="455" REF="4580"/>
January; and ordered a detachment of foot-guards to secure count Gyllenburg the Swedish minister, with all his papers. At the same time Sir Jacob Bancks and Mr. Charles Caesar, were apprehended. The other foreign ministers took the alarm, and remonstrated to the ministry upon this outrage committed against the law of nations. The two secretaries Stanhope and Methuen, wrote circular letters to them, assuring them, that in a day or two they should be acquainted with the reasons that induced the king to take such an extraordi∣nary step. They were generally satisfied with this intimation; but the marquis de Monte Leone, ambassador from Spain, expressed his concern, that no other way could be found to preserve the peace of the kingdom, without arresting the person of a public minister, and seizing all his papers, which were the sacred re∣positories of his master's secrets: he observed, that in whatever manner these two facts might seem to be understood, they very sensibly wounded the law of nations. About the same time baron Gortz, the Swedish residentiary in Hol∣land, was seized with his papers at Arnheim, at the desire of king George, communicated to the states by Mr. Leathes his minister at the Hague. The baron owned he had projected the invasion, a design that was justified by the conduct of king George, who had assisted the princes in confederacy against the king of Sweden, without having received the least provocation; who assisted the king of Denmark in subduing the dutchies of Bremen and Verden; and then pur∣chased them of the usurper; and who had, in the course of this very summer, sent a strong squadron of ships to the Baltic, where it joined the Danes and Russians against the Swedish fleet.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>When the parliament of Great Britain met on the twentieth day of February, the king informed them of the triple alliance he had concluded with France and Holland. He mentioned the projected invasion; told them he had given orders for laying before them copies of the letters which had passed be∣tween the Swedish ministers on that subject; and he demanded of the commons such supplies as should be found necessary for the defence of the kingdom. By those papers it appeared, that the scheme projected by baron Gortz was very plausible, and even ripe for execution; which, however, was postponed until the army should be reduced, and the Dutch auxiliaries sent back to their own country. The letters being read in parliament, both houses presented addresses, in which they extolled the king's prudence in establishing such conventions with foreign potentates, as might repair the gross defects, and prevent the pernicious consequences of the treaty of Utrecht, which they termed a treacherous and dishonourable peace: and, they expressed their horror and indignation at the malice and ingratitude of those who had encouraged an invasion of their coun∣try. He likewise received an address of the same kind from the convocation; another from the dissenting ministers; a third from the university of Cambridge; but Oxford was not so lavish of her compliments. At a meeting of the vice∣chancellor and heads of that university, a motion was made for an address to the king, on the suppression of the late unnatural rebellion; his majesty's safe return; and the favour lately shewn to the university, in omitting, at their re∣quest, the ceremony of burning in effigy the devil, the pope, the pretender, the duke of Ormond, and the earl of Mar, on the anniversary of his majesty's ac∣cession. Dr. Smalridge bishop of Bristol, observed, that the rebellion had been long suppressed: that there would be no end of addresses, should one be pre∣sented
<PB N="456" REF="4590"/>
every time that his majesty returned from his German dominions: that the late favour they had received was overballanced by a whole regiment now quartered upon them and, that there was no precedent for addressing a king upon his return from his German dominions. The university thought they had reason to complain of the little regard payed to their remonstrance, touching a n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t raised in that city by the soldiers there quartered, on pretence, that the anniversary of the prince's birth-day had not been celebrated with the usual <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Affidavits had been sent up to the council, which seemed to favour the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the regiment. When the house of lords deliberated upon the muti∣ny<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>l, by which the soldiers were exempted from arrest for debts, complaint was made of their licentious behaviour at Oxford; with a motion, that they should inquire into the riot. They presented an address, desiring, that the pa∣pers relating to that affair might be layed before the house. These being perused, were found to be recriminations between the Oxonians and the officers of the regiment. A warm debate ensued, during which, the earl of Abingdon offered a petition from the vice chancellor of the university, the mayor, and magistrates of Oxford, praying to be heard. One of the court-members observing, that it would be irregular to receive a petition while the house was in a grand com∣mittee, a motion was made, that the chairman should leave the chair: but, this being carried in the negative, the debate was resumed, and the majority agreed to the following resolutions: That the heads of the university, and mayor of the city, neglected to make public rejoicings on the prince's birth-day: That the officers having met to celebrate that day, the house in which they were was assauited, and the windows were broken by the rabble: That this assault was the beginning and occasion of the riots that ensued: That the conduct of the major seemed well justified by the affidavits produced on his part: That the printing and publishing the depositions, upon which the complaints relating to the riots at Oxford, were founded, while that matter was under the exami∣nation<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> of the lords of the committee of the council, and before they had time to come to any resolution touching the same, was irregular, disrespectful to his royal highness, and tending to sedition. An inquiry of this nature so managed, did not much redound to the honour of such an august assembly.</P>

<P>The commons passed a bill, prohibiting all commerce with Sweden, a branch of trade which was of the utmost consequence to the English merchants. They voted ten thousand seamen for the ensuing year, granted about a million for the maintenance of guards, garrisons, and land-forces; and passed the bill relating to mutiny and desertion. The house likewise voted four and twenty thousand pounds for the payment of four battalions of Munster and two of Saxegotha, which the king had taken into his service, to supply the place of such as might be, during the rebellion, drawn from the garrisons of the states general to the assistance of England. This vote, however, was not car∣ried without a violent debate. The demand was inveighed against as an impo∣sition, seeing no such troops had ever served. A motion was made for an address, desiring, that the instructions of those who concluded the treaties, might be layed before the house; but this was over-ruled by the majority <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This year was rendered famous by a com∣plete vict ry which prince Eugene obtained over the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at Peterwaradin upon the Danube. The battle was fought on the fifth day of Au∣gust. The Imperial army did not exceed sixty thousand men: that of the Infidels amounted to one hundred and fifty thousand, commanded by the grand vizir, who was mortally wounded in the engagement. The Infidels were totally de∣feated, with the loss of all their tents, artillery, and baggage; so that the victors obtained an im∣mense booty.</NOTE>. The sup∣plies
<PB N="457" REF="4600"/>
were raised by a land-tax of three shillings in the pound, and a malt-tax. What the commons had given was not thought sufficient for the expence of the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1717.</NOTE> year; therefore Mr. secretary Stanhope brought a message from his majesty, demanding an extraordinary supply, that he might be the better enabled to se∣cure his kingdoms against the danger with which they were threatened from Sweden; and he moved, that a supply should be granted to his majesty for this purpose. Mr. Shippen said, it was a great misfortune that the king was as little acquainted with the parliamentary proceedings as with the language of the country: that the message was unparliamentary and unprecedented; and, in his opinion, penned by some foreign minister: he had been often told, that his majesty had retrieved the honour and reputation of the nation; a truth which appeared in the flourishing condition of trade: that the supply demanded seemed to be inconsistent with the glorious advantages which his majesty had obtained for the people. He was seconded by Mr. Hungerford, who declared, that for his part he could not understand what occasion there was for new alli∣ances; much less, that they should be purchased with money. He expressed his surprize, that a nation so lately the terror of France and Spain, should now seem to fear so inconsiderable an enemy as the king of Sweden. The motion was supported by Mr. Boscawen, Sir Gilbert Heathcote, and others; but some of the Whigs spoke against it; and Mr. Robert Walpole was silent. The speaker and Mr. Smith, one of the tellers of the exchequer, opposed this unparliamentary way of demanding the supply: the former proposed, that part of the army should be disbanded, and the money applied towards the making good such new engagements as were deemed necessary. After se∣veral successive debates, the resolution for a supply was carried by a ma∣jority of four voices.</P>

<P>The ministry was now divided within itself. Lord Townshend had been removed from the office of secretary of state by the intrigues of the earl of Sunderland; and he was now likewise dismissed from the place of lord-lieute∣nant of Ireland. Mr. Robert Walpole resigned his posts of first commissioner of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer; and his example was followed by Mr. Pulteney secretary at war, and Mr. Methuen secretary of state. When the affair of the supply was resumed in the house of commons, Mr. Stanhope made a motion for granting two hundred and fifty thousand pounds for that purpose. Mr. Pulteney observed, that having resigned his place, he might now act with the freedom becoming an Englishman: he declared against the man∣ner of granting the supply as unparliamentary and unprecedented. He said, he could not persuade himself that any Englishman advised his majesty to send such a message; but he doubted not, the resolution of a British parliament would make a German ministry tremble. Mr. Stanhope having harangued the house in vindication of the ministry, Mr. Smith answered every article of his speech: he affirmed, that if an estimate of the conduct of the ministry in relation to af∣fairs abroad, was to be made from a comparison of their conduct at home, they would not appear altogether so faultless as they were represented. <Q>“Was it not a

<P>On the sixth day of May the king going to the house of peers, gave the parliament to understand, that the fleet under Sir George Byng, which had sailed to the Baltic to observe the motion of the Swedes, was safely arrived in the Sound. He said, he had given orders for the immediate reduction of ten thousand soldiers, as well as directions to prepare an act of indemnity. He de∣sired they would take proper measures for reducing the public debts with a just regard to parliamentary credit; and, that they would go through the public business with all possible dispatch and unanimity. Some progress had already been made in deliberations upon the debt of the nation, which was compre∣hended under the two heads of redeemable and irredeemable incumbrances. The first had been contracted with a redeemable interest; and these the public had a right to discharge: the others consisted of long and short annuities granted for a greater or less number of years, which could not be altered without the consent of the proprietors. Mr. Robert Walpole had projected a scheme for lessening the interest, and paying the capital of those debts, before he resigned his place in the exchequer. He proposed, in the house of commons, to reduce the interest of redeemable funds, and offer an alternative to the proprietors of an∣nuities. His plan was approved; but when he resigned his places, the mini∣sters made some small alterations in it, which furnished him with a pretence for opposing the scheme. In the course of the debate some warm altercation passed between him and Mr. Stanhope, by which it appeared, they had made a
<PB N="459" REF="4620"/>
practice of selling places and reversions. Mr. Hungerford standing up, said, he was sorry to see two such great men running foul of one another: that, however, they ought to be looked upon as patriots and fathers of their country; and, since they had by mischance discovered their nakedness, the other members ought, according to the custom of the East, to turn their backs upon them, that they might not be seen in such a shameful condition. Mr. Boscawen moved, That the house would lay their commands upon them, that no further notice should be taken of what had passed. He was seconded by Mr. Methuen: the house approved of the motion; and the speaker took their word and honour, that they should not prosecute their resentment. The money-corporations hav∣ing agreed to provide cash for such creditors as should be willing to receive their principal, the house came to certain resolutions, on which were founded the three bills that passed into laws, under the names of <Q>“The South-sea act, the Bank act, and the General-fund act.”</Q> The original stock of the South-sea company did not exceed nine millions four hundred and seventy-one thousand three hundred and twenty-five pounds; but the funds granted being sufficient to answer the interest of ten millions at six per cent. the company made up that sum to the government, for which they received six hundred thousand pounds yearly, and eight thousand pounds a-year for management. By this act they declared themselves willing to receive five hundred thousand pounds, and the eight thousand for management. It was enacted, That the company should continue a corporation, until the redemption of their annuity, towards which not less than a million should be payed at a time. They were likewise required to advance a sum not exceeding two millions, towards dis∣charging the principal and interest, due on the four lottery funds of the ninth and tenth years of queen Anne. By the bank-act the governors and company declared themselves willing to accept an annuity of eighty-eight thousand seven hundred and fifty-one pounds, seven shillings, and ten pence halfpenny, or the principal of one million seven hundred and seventy-five thousand twenty-seven pounds, seventeen shillings, and ten-pence halfpenny, in lieu of the present an∣nuity, amounting to one hundred and six thousand five hundred and one pounds, thirteen shillings, and five pence. They likewise declared themselves willing to discharge, and deliver up to be cancelled, as many exchequer-bills as amounted to two millions, and to accept of an annuity of one hundred thou∣sand pounds, being after the rate of five per cent. redeemable after one year's notice; to circulate the remaining exchequer-bills at three per cent. and one penny per day. It was enacted, That the former allowances should be conti∣nued to Christmas, and then the bank should have for circulating the two mil∣lions five hundred and sixty-one thousand and twenty-five pounds remaining exchequer-bills, an annuity of seventy-six thousand eight hundred and thirty pounds fifteen shillings, at the rate of three pounds per cent. till redeemed, over and above the one penny a-day for interest. By the same act the bank was required to advance a sum not exceeding two millions five hundred thou∣sand pounds, towards discharging the national debt, if wanted, on condition, that they should have five pounds per cent. for as much as they might advance, redeemable by parliament. The general-fund act recited the several acts of parliament, for establishing the four lotteries in the ninth and tenth years of the

<P>The e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rl of Oxford, who had now remained almost two years a pri∣soner in the Tower, presen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed a petition to the house of lords, praying, that his imprisonment might not be indefinite. Some of the Tory lords affirmed, that the impeachment was destroyed and determined by the prorogation of par∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament, which superseded the whole proceedings; but the contrary was voted by a considerable majority. The thirteenth day of June was fixed for the trial; and the house of commons made acquainted with this determination. The commons appointed a committee to inquire into the state of the earl's im∣peachment; and, in consequence of their report, sent a message to the lords, de∣manding longer time to prepare for the trial. Accordingly the day was prolonged to the twenty-fourth of June; and the commons appointed the committee, with four other members, to be the managers for making good the articles of impeachment. At the appointed time the peers repaired to the court in Westminster-hall, where lord Cowper presided as lord-steward. The commons were assembled as a committee of the whole house: the king, the rest of the royal family, and the foreign ministers, assisted at the solemnity: the earl of Oxford was brought from the Tower: the articles of impeachment were read, with his answers, and the replication of the commons.

There he represented, that a great deal of time would be unnecessarily consumed in go∣ing through all the articles of the impeachment: that if the commons would make go<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the two articles for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh-treason, the earl of Oxford would forfeit both l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe and estate, and there would be an end of the matter: whereas, to proceed on the method proposed by the commons, would draw the trial on to a prodig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous length. He therefore moved, that the commons might not be ad∣mitted to pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ceed, until judgment should be first given upon the articles for high-treason. He was supported by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> earls of Anglesey and Nottingham, the lord

Trevor, and a considerable number of both part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es; and though opposed by the earl of Sunderland, the lords Coningsby, and Parker, the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion was carried in the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>irmative. It produced a dispute between the two houses. The commons, at a con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, delivered a paper, containing their reasons for asserting it as their undoubted right to impeach a pe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r either for tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>son, or for high crimes and misdemeanours; or, should they see occasion, to mix both in the same accusation.

The commons de∣mand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a free conference, which was refused. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> grew more and more warm. The lords sent a message to the lower house, importing, that they intended presently to proceed on the trial of the earl of Oxford. They com∣mons payed no regard to this intimation; but adjourned to the third day of July. The lords rep<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ring to Westminster-hall, took their places, ordered the earl to be brought to the bar, and made proclamation for his accusers to appear. Having w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted a quarter of an hour, they adjourned to their own house, where, after so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e debate, the earl was acquitted upon a division: then returning to the hall, they voted, That he should be set at liberty. Oxford owed his safety to the dissensions among the ministers, and to the late change in the administration, in consequence of which he was delivered from the persecution of Walpole; and numbered among his friend<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the dukes of Devonshire and Argyle, the earls of Nottingham and Ilay, and the lord Townshend. The commons, in order to express their sense of his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emerit, presented an address to the king, desiring he might be excepted out of the intended act of grace. The king promised to comply with their request; and in the mean time forbade the earl to appear at court. On the fifteenth day of July the earl of Sunderland deli∣vered in the house of peers the act of grace, which passed through both houses with great expedition. From this indulgence were excepted the earl of Oxford, Mr. Prior, Mr. Thomas Harley, Mr. Arthur Moor, Crisp, Nodes, Obryan, Redmayne the printer, and Thompson, the assassina∣tors in Newgate, and the clan of Macgregor in Scotland. By virtue of this act, the earl of Carnwath, the lords Widdrington and Nairn were immediately discharged; together with all the gentlemen under sentence of death in Newgate, and those that were confined on account of the rebellion, in the Fleet, the Marshalsea, and other prisons of the kingdom. The act of grace being prepared for the royal assent, the king went to the house of peers on the fifteenth day of July, and having given his sanction to all the bills that were ready, closed the session with a speech on the usual topics.</P>

<P>The proceedings in the convocation turned chiefly upon two per∣formances of Dr. Hoadley bishop of Bangor.

<PB N="462" REF="4650"/>
which the Preservative and the sermon were censured, as tending to subvert all government and discipline in the church of Christ; to reduce his king∣dom to a state of anarchy and confusion; to impugn and impeach the royal supremacy in causes ecclesiastical, and the authority of the legislature, to inforce obedience in matters of religion by civil sanctions. The government thought proper to put a stop to these proceedings by a prorogation; which, however, inflamed the controversy. A great number of pens were drawn against the bishop; but, his chief antagonists were Dr. Snape and Dr. Sherlock, whom the king removed from the office of his chaplains; and the convocation has not been permitted to sit and do business since that period.</P>

<P>DURING these transactions, the negotiations of the North were con∣tinued against the king of Sweden, who had penetrated into Nor∣way, and advanced towards Christianstadt, the capital of that kingdom. The czar had sent five and twenty thousand Russians to assist the allies in the reduc∣tion of Wismar, which he intended to bestow upon his niece, lately married to the duke of Mecklenburg Swerin: but before his troops arrived, the place had surrendered, and the Russians were not admitted into the garrison; a cir∣cumstance which increased the misunderstanding between him and the king of Great Britain. Nevertheless, he consented to a project for making a descent upon Schonen, and actually took upon him the command of the allied fleet; though he was not at all pleased to see Sir John Norris in the Baltic, because he had formed designs against Denmark, which he knew the English squadron would protect. He suddenly desisted from the expedition against Schonen, on pretence that the season was too far advanced; and the king of Denmark pu∣blished a manifesto remonstrating against his conduct on this occasion. By this time baron Gortz had planned a pacification between his master and the czar, who was discontented with all his German allies, because they opposed his having any footing in the empire. This monarch arrived at Amsterdam in December, whither he was followed by the czarina; and he actually resided at
<PB N="464" REF="4670"/>
the Hague when king George passed through it, in return to his British domi∣nions: but he declined an interview with the king of England. When Gyl∣lenburg'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> letters were published in London, some passages seemed to favour the supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on of the czar's being privy to the conspiracy. His minister at the Eng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sh court presented a long memorial, complaining that the king had caused to be printed, the malicious in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nuations of his enemies. He denied his having the least concern in the design of the Swedish k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng. He charged the court of England with having p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vately treated of a separate peace with Charles, and even with having promised to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>st him against the czar, on condition that he would relinquish his pretensions to Bremen and Verden. Nevertheless, he ex∣pressed an in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lination to re <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the antient good understanding, and to en∣gage in v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> measures for pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ing the war against the common enemy. The memorial was answered by the king of Great Britain, who assured the czar he should have reason to be fully satisfied, if he would remove the only obstacle to their mutual good understanding; in other words, withdraw the Russian troops from the empire. Notwithstanding these professions, the two monarchs were never perfectly reconciled.</P>

<P>The czar made an excursion to the court of France, where he con∣cluded a treaty of friendship with the regent, at whose earnest desire he promised to recall his troops from Mecklenburg. At his return to Amsterdam, he had a private interview with Gortz, who, as well as Gyllenburg, had been set at liberty. That mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ter undertook to adjust all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fferences between the czar and the king of Sw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n within three months; and Peter engaged to suspend all operations against Sweden, until that term should be expired. A congress was opened at Abo, between the Swedish and Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>an ministers; but the con∣ferences were afterwards removed to Aland. By this convention, the czar obliged himself to assist Charles in the conquest of Norway; and they pro∣mised to unite all their forces against the king of Great Britain, should he pre∣sume to interpose. Both were incensed against that prince; and one part of their design was to raise the pretender to the throne of England. Baron Gortz set out from Aland for Frederickstadt in Norway, with the plan of peace; but, before he arrived, Charles was killed by a cannon ball from the town, as he visited the trenches, on the thirtieth of November. Baron Gortz was immediately ar∣rested, and brought to the scaffold by the nobles of Sweden, whose hatred he had incurred by his insolence of behaviour. The death of Charles was fortunate for king George. Sweden was now obliged to submit: while the czar, the king of Denmark, and the elector of Hanover, kept possession of what they had acquired in the course of the war.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Thus Bremen and Verden were secured to the house of Hanover: an acquisition towards which the English nation contributed by her money, as well as by her arms: an acquisition made in contradiction to the engagements into which England entered when king William became guarantee for the treaty of Travendahl: an acquisition that may be considered as the first link of a political chain by which the English nation was dragged back into ex∣pensive connexions with the continent. The king had not yet received the investiture of these dutchies; and, until that should be procured, it was ne∣cessary to espouse with warmth the interests of the emperor. This was another source of misunderstanding between Great Britain and Spain. Prince Eugene
<PB N="465" REF="4680"/>
gained another complete victory over a prodigious army of the Turks at Bel∣grade, which was surrendered to him after the battle. The emperor had en∣gaged in this war as an ally of the Venetians, whom the Turks had attacked and driven from the Morea. The pope considered it as a religious war against the infidels; and obtained repeated assurances from the king of Spain, that he would not undertake any thing against the emperor, while he was engaged in such a laudable quarrel. Philip had even sent a squadron of ships and gallies to the assistance of the Venetians. In the course of this year, however, he equipped a strong armament, the command of which he bestowed on the marquis de Lede, who sailed from Barcelona in July, and landing at Cagliari in Sardinia, which belonged to the emperor, made a conquest of the whole island. At the same time, the king of Spain endeavoured to justify these proceedings by a manifesto, in which he alledged that the archduke, con∣trary to the faith of treaties, encouraged and supported the rebellion of his subjects in Catalonia, by frequent succours from Naples and other places; and that the great inquisitor of Spain had been seized, though furnished with a pass∣port from his holiness. He promised, however, to proceed no farther, and suspend all operations, that the powers of Europe might have time and oppor∣tunity to contrive expedients for reconciling all differences, and securing the peace and balance of power in Italy: nay, he consented that this important affair should be left to the arbitration of king George and the states-general. These powers undertook the office. Conferences were begun between the ministers of the emperor, France, England, and Holland; and these produced, in the course of the following year, the famous quadruple alliance. In this treaty it was stipulated, That the emperor should renounce all pretensions to the crown of Spain, and exchange Sardinia for Sicily, with the duke of Savoy: That the succession to the dutchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, which the queen of Spain claimed by inheritance, as princess of the house of Farnese, should be settled on her eldest son, in case the present possessors should die without male issue. Philip, dissatisfied with this partition, continued to make formidable preparations by sea and land. The king of England and the regent of France inte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>posed their admonitions to no purpose. At length his Britannic majesty had recourse to more substantial arguments, and ordered a strong squadron to be equipped with all possible expedition <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pretende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, who resided at Urbino, having received intelligence from Paris, that there was a design formed against his life, pope Clement XI. gave directions that all foreigners in that neighbourhood, especially English, should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rested. The earl of Peterborough arriving at Bologna with a few armed followers, was seized, with all his papers. Being inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogated, he said he came to pass some time in Italy, for the benefit of the air. He was close confined for a whole month in Fort Urbino, and his at∣tendants were sent to prison. Nothing appear∣ing to justify the suspicion, he was dismissed with uncommon civility. The king demanding re∣paration for this insult, the pope wrote with his own hand a letter to an ally of Great Britain, declaring, that the legate of Bologna had vio∣lently and unjustly, without the knowledge of his holiness, caused the earl of Peterborough to be seized upon suspicions which proved to be ill grounded. The cardinal-legate sent a decla∣ration to the English admiral in the Mediter∣ranean, that he had asked forgivenness of his holiness, and now begged pardon of his Bri∣tannic majesty, for having unadvisedly arrested a peer of Great Britain on his travels.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>On the third day of November the princess of Wales was delivered of a prince, the ceremony of whose baptism was productive of a difference be∣tween
<PB N="466" REF="4690"/>
the grandfather and father. The prince of Wales intended that his uncle the duke of York should stand godfather. The king ordered the duke of Newcastle to stand for himself. After the ceremony, the prince expressed his resentment against this nobleman in very warm terms. The king ordered the prince to confine himself within his own apartments; and afterwards signified his pleasure that he should quit the palace of St. James's. He retired with the princess to a house belonging to the earl of Grantham; but the children were returned at the palace. All peers and peeresses, and all privy-counsellors and their wives, were given to understand, that in case they visited the prince and princess, they should have no access to his majesty's presence; and all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>o <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> and places under both king and prince, were obliged to qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of one or other, at their option. When the parliament met on the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> day of November, the king, in his speech, told both houses, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the army to very near one half, since the beginning of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> his desire that all those who were friends to the pre∣sent <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> might unanimously concur in some proper method for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the protestant interest, of which, as the church of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was unquestionably the main support and bulwark, so would she reap <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> principal benefit of every advantage accruing from the union and mutual charity of all protestants. After the addresses of thanks, which were couched in the usual st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, the commons proceeded to take into consideration the estimates and accounts, in order to settle the establishment of the army, navy, and ordnance. Ten thousand men were voted for the sea-service. When the supply for the army fell under deliberation, a very warm debate en∣sued upon the number of troops necessary to be maintained. Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Walpole, in a long elaborate harrangue, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon its being reduced to twelve thousand. They were answered by Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> at war, and Sir David Dalrymple. Mr. Shippen, in the courte of the debate, said the second paragraph of the king's speech seemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of Germany than for Great Britain; and it was a great misfortune that the king was a stranger to our language and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> affirmed this was a scandalous invective against the lung's person and government; and moved that he should be sent to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>wer.

His majesty complied
<PB N="467" REF="4700"/>
with their request: but people hoarding up their silver, in hope that the price of it would be raised; or in apprehension that the gold would be lowered still farther, the two houses resolved that the standard of the gold and silver coins of the kingdom should not be altered in fineness, weight, or denomina∣tion; and they ordered a bill to be brought in to prevent the melting down of the silver coin. At this period, one James Shepherd, a youth of eighteen, appretence to a coachmaker, and an enthusiast in Jacobitism, sent a letter to a nonjuring clergyman, proposing a scheme for assassinating king George. He was immediately apprehended, owned the design, was tried, condemned, and executed at Tyburn. This was likewise the fate of the marquis de Palleotti, an Italian nobleman, brother to the dutchess of Shrewsbury. He had, in a transport of passion, killed his own servant; and seemed indeed to be dis∣ordered in his brain. After he had received sentence of death, the king's pardon was earnestly sollicited by his sister the dutchess, and many other per∣sons of the first distinction: but the common people became so clamorous, that it was thought dangerous to rescue him from the penalties of the law, which he accordingly underwent in the most ignominious manner. No subject produced so much heat and altercation in parliament during this session, as did the bill for regulating the land-forces, and punishing mutiny and desertion: a bill which was looked upon as an incroach∣ment upon the liberties and constitution of England, in as much as it esta∣blished martial law, which wrested from the civil magistrate the cognizance of crimes and misdemeanours committed by the soldiers and officers of the army: a jurisdiction inconsistent with the genius and disposition of the people. The dangers that might accrue from such a power were explained in the lower house by Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Harley, and Mr. Robert Walpole, which last, however, voted afterwards for the bill. In the house of lords, it was strenuously opposed by the earls of Oxford, Strafford, and lord Harcourt. Their objections were answered by lord Carteret. The bill passed by a great majority; but divers lords entered a protest. This affair being discussed, a bill was brought in for vesting in trustees the forfeited estates in Britain and Ireland, to be sold for the use of the public; for giving relief to lawful cre∣ditors, by determining the claims; and for the more effectual bringing into<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon.

The time of claiming was prolonged: the sum of twenty thousand pounds was reserved out of the sale of the estates in Scotland, for erecting schools; and eight thousand pounds for building barracks in that kingdom. The king having signified, by a message to the house of commons, that he had lately received such information from abroad, as gave reason to believe that a naval force, employed where it should be necessary, would give weight to his en∣deavours: he therefore thought fit to acquaint the house with this circum∣stance, not doubting but that in case he should be obliged, at this critical juncture, to exceed the number of men granted this year for the sea-service, the house would provide for such exceeding. The commons immediately drew up and presented an address, assuring his majesty that they would make good such exceedings of seamen as he should find necessary to preserve the tranquil∣lity of Europe.

M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n while, the negotiations between the English and French ministers produced the quadruple alliance, by which king George and the re∣gent prescribed a peace between the emperor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the king of Spain, and the king of Sicily<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and undertock to compel Philip and the Savoyard to submit to such conditions as they had concerted with the emperor. These powers were allowed only three months to consider the articles, and declare whether they would re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t them, or acquiesce in the partition. Nothing could be more con∣tradictory to the true interest of Great-Britain than this treaty, which destroyed the balance in Italy, by throwing such an accession of power into the hands of the house of Austria; interrupted the commerce with Spain; involved the king∣dom in an immediate war with that monarchy; and gave rise to all the quar∣rels and disputes which have arisen between England and Spain in the sequel. The states-general did not approve of such violent measures, and for some time kept aloof; but at length they acceded to the quadruple alliance, which inde<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d was no other than a very expensive compliment to the emperor, who was desirous of adding Sicily to his other Italian dominions.</P>

<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The king of England had used some endeavours to compromise the difference between his Imperial majesty and the Spanish branch of the house of Bourbon. Lord Stanhope had been sent to Madrid with a plan of pacification, which being rejected by Philip, as partial and iniquitous, the king determined to support his mediation by force of arms. Sir George Byng sailed from Spithead on the fourth day of June, with twenty ships of the line, two fire∣ships, two bomb-vessels, and ample instructions how to act on all emergencies. He arrived off cape St Vincent on the thirtieth day of the month, when he dispatched his secretary to Cadiz with a letter to colonel Stanhope the British minister at Madrid, desiring him to inform his most catholic majesty of the ad∣miral's arrival in those parts, and lay before him this article of his instructions: <Q>“You are to make instances with both parties to cease from using any further a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stility: but in case the Spaniards do still insist, with their ships of war and forces, to attack the kingdom of Naples, or other the territories of
<PB N="469" REF="4720"/>
the emperor in Italy, or to land in any part of Italy, which can only be with a design to invade the emperor's dominions, against whom only they have declared war by invading Sardinia; or if they should endeavour to make themselves masters of the kingdom of Sicily, which must be with a design to invade the kingdom of Naples; in which case you are, with all your power, to hinder and obstruct the same. If it should so happen, that at your ar∣rival, with our fleet under your command, in the Mediterranean, the Spa∣niards should already have landed any troops in Italy, in order to invade the emperor's territories, you shall endeavour amicably to dissuade them from persevering in such an attempt, and offer them your assistance to help them to withdraw their troops, and put an end to all further acts of hostility. But, in case these your friendly endeavours should prove in∣effectual, you shall, by keeping company with, or intercepting their ships or convoy; or, if it be necessary, by openly opposing them, defend the empe∣ror's territories from any further attempt.”</Q> When cardinal Alberoni pe∣rused these instructions, he told colonel Stanhope with some warmth, that his master would run all hazards, and even suffer himself to be driven out of Spain, rather than recall his troops, or consent to a suspension of arms. He said the Spaniards were not to be frightened; and he was so well convinced that the fleet would do their duty, that in case of their being attacked by admiral Byng, he should be in no pain for the success. Mr. Stanhope presenting him with a list of the British squadron, he threw it upon the ground with great emotion. He promised, however, to lay the admiral's letters before the king, and to let the envoy know his majesty's resolution. Such an interposition could not but be very provoking to the Spanish minister, who had layed his account with the conquest of Sicily, and for that purpose prepared an armament which was al∣together surprising, considering the late shattered condition of the Spanish af∣fairs. He seems to have put too much confidence in the strength of the Spanish fleet. In a few days he sent back the admiral's letter to Mr. Stanhope, with a note under it, importing, that the chevalier Byng might execute the orders he had received from the king his master.</P>

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The admiral, in passing by Gibraltar, was joined by vice-admiral Cornwal with two ships. He proceeded to Minorca, where he relieved the garrison of Portmahon. Then he sailed for Naples, where he arrived on the first day of August, and was received as a deliverer: for the Neapolitans had been under the utmost terror of an invasion from the Spaniards. Sir George Byng received intelligence from the viceroy count Daun, who treated him with the most distinguishing marks of respect, that the Spanish army amounting to thirty thousand men, commanded by the marquis de Lede, had landed in Si∣cily, reduced Palermo and Messina, and were then employed in the siege of the citadel belonging to this last city: that the Piedmontese garrison would be obliged to surrender, if not speedily relieved: that an alliance was upon the carpet between the emperor and the king of Sicily, which last had desired the assistance of the Imperial troops, and agreed to receive them into the citadel of Messina. The admiral immediately resolved to sail thither, and took under his convoy a reinforcement of two thousand Germans for the citadel, under the command of general Wetzel. He forthwith sailed from Naples, and on the ninth day of August was in sight of the Faro of Messina. He dispatched his
<PB N="4$0" REF="4730"/>
own captain with a polite message to the marquis de Lede, proposing a cessa∣tion of arms in Sicily for two months, that the powers of Europe might have time to concert measures for restoring a lasting peace; and declaring, that should this proposal be rejected, he would, in pursuance of his instructions, use all his force to prevent further attempts to disturb the dominions his master had engaged to de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>end. The Spanish general answered, that he had no powers to trea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, consequently could not agree to an armistice, but should obey his orders, which directed him to reduce Sicily for his master the king of Spain. The Spanish <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet had sailed from the harbour of Messina on the day before the English squadron appeared. Admiral Byng supposed they had retired to Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta, and directed his course towards Messina, in order to encourage and support the garrison in the citadel. But, in doubling the point of Faro, he deseried two Spanish scouts, and learned from the people of a felucca from the Calabrian shore, that they had seen from the hills the Spanish fleet lying to in order of batt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e. The admiral immediately detached the German troops to Reggio, under convoy of two ships of war. Then he stood through the Faro after the Spanish scouts that led him to their main fleet, which before noon he deseried in line of battle, amounting to seven and twenty sail large and small, besides two fireships, four bomb vessels, and seven gallies. They were com∣manded in chief by Don Antonio de Castanita, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er whom were the four rear admirals Chacon, Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, Guevara, and Cammock. At sight of the English squadron they stood away large, and Byng gave chace all the rest of the day. In the morning, which was the eleventh of August, the rear-admiral de Mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with six ships of war, the gallies, fire-ships and bomb-ketches, se∣parated from the main f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet, and stood in for the Sicilian shore. The English admiral detached captain Walton with five ships in pursuit of them; and they were soon engaged. He himself continued to chace their main fleet; and about ten o'clock the battle began. The Spaniards seemed to be distracted in their counsels, and acted in confusion. They made a running fight, and the ad∣mirals behaved with courage and activity, in spite of which they were all taken but Cammock, who made his escape with three ships of war and three frigates. In this engagement, which happened off cape Passaro, captain Haddock of the Grafton <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gnalized his courage in an extraordinary manner. On the eighteenth the admiral received a letter from captain Walton, dated off Syra∣cuse, intimating that he had taken four Spanish ships of war, together with a bomb-ketch, and a vessel laden with arms; and that he had burned four ships of the line, a fireship, and a bomb-vessel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> letter i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> deemed a curious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pe∣cimen of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le.</P>

order of battle: besides, the Spaniards might have been reinforced from the army on shore, which would have raised batteries to annoy the assailants. Before king George had received an account of this engagement from the admiral, he wrote him a letter with his own hand, approving his conduct. When Sir George's eldest son arrived in England, with a circumstantial account of the action, he was graciously received, and sent back with plenipotentiary powers to his fa∣ther, that he might negotiate with the several princes and states of Italy, as he should see occasion. The son likewise carried the king's royal grant to the officers and seamen, of all the prizes they had taken from the Spaniards. Notwithstanding this victory, the Spanish army carried on the siege of the ci∣tadel of Messina with such vigour, that the governor surrendered the place by capitulation on the twenty-ninth day of September. A treaty was now con∣cluded at Vienna between the emperor and the duke of Savoy. They agreed to form an army for the conquest of Sardinia in behalf of the duke; and in the mean time this prince engaged to evacuate Sicily: but until his troops could be conveyed from that island, he consented that they should co-operate with the Germans against the common enemy. Admiral Byng continued to assist the Imperialists in Sicily, during the best part of the winter, by scouring the seas of the Spaniards, and keeping the communication open between the German forces and the Calabrian shore, from whence they were supplied with provisions. He acted in this service with equal conduct, resolution, and activity. He conferred with the viceroy of Naples, and the other Imperial generals, about the operations of the ensuing campaign, and count Hamilton was dispatched to Vienna, to lay before the emperor the result of their deli∣berations: then the admiral set sail for Mahon, where his ships might be re∣fitted, and put in a condition to take the sea in the spring.</P>

<P>The destruction of the Spanish fleet was a subject that employed the deliberations and conjecture of all the politicians in Europe. Spain exclaimed against the conduct of England, as inconsistent with the rules of good faith, for the observation of which she had always been so famous. The marquis de Monteleone wrote a letter to Mr. secretary Craggs, in which he expostulated with him upon such an unprecedented outrage. Cardinal Alberoni, in a letter to that minister, inveighed against it as a base unworthy action. He said the neutrality of Italy was a weak pretence, since every body knew that neutrality had long been at an end; and that the princes guarantees of the treaty of Utrecht were intirely discharged from their engagements, not only by the scan∣dalous infringements committed by the Austrians in the evacuation of Cata∣lonia and Majorca; but also because the guaranty was no longer binding than <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill a peace was concluded with France. He taxed the British ministry with having revived and supported this neutrality, not by an amicable mediation, but by open violence, and artfully abusing the confidence and security of the Spaniards. This was the language of disappointed ambition. Nevertheless, it must be owned, that the conduct of England on this occasion was irregular, partial, and precipitate.</P>

<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>On the thirteenth day of December, earl Stanhope declared, in the house of lords, that, in order to unite the hearts of the well-affected to the present establishment, he had a bill to offer under the title of "An act for "strengthening the protestant interest in these kingdoms." It was accord∣ingly read, and appeared to be a bill repealing the acts against occasional con∣formity, the growth of schism, and some clauses in the corporation and test acts. This had been concerted by the ministry, in private meetings with the most eminent dissenters. The Tory lords were astonished at this motion, for which they were altogether unprepared. Nevertheless, they were strenuous in their opposition. They alledged that the bill, instead of strengthening, would certainly weaken the church of England, by plucking off her best feathers, investing her enemies with power, and sharing with churchmen the civil and military employments of which they were then wholly possessed. Earl Cowper declared himself against that part of the bill by which some clauses of the test and corporation acts were repealed; because he looked upon those acts as the main bulwark of our excellent constitution in church and state, which ought to be inviolably preserved. The earl of Ilay opposed the bill, because, in his opinion, it infringed the pacta conventa of the treaty of union, by which the bounds both of the church of England and of the church of Scotland were fixed and settled; and he was apprehensive, if the articles of the union were broke with respect to one church, it might afterwards be a precedent to break them with respect to the other. The archbishop of Canter∣bury said, the acts which by this bill would be repealed, were the main bul∣wark and supporters of the English church: he expressed all imaginable ten∣derness for well-meaning conscientious dissenters; but he could not forbear saying, some among that sect made a wrong use of the favour and indulgence shewn to them at the revolution, though they had the least share in that happy event: it was therefore thought necessary for the legislature to interpose, and put a stop to the scandalous practice of occasional conformity. He added, that it would be needless to repeal the act against schism, since no advantage had been taken of it, to the prejudice of the dissenters. Dr. Hoadly bishop of Ban∣gor endeavoured to prove that the occasional and schism acts were in effect persecuting laws; and that by admitting the principle of self-defence and self-preservation, in matters of religion, all the persecutions maintained by the heathens against the professors of Christianity, and even the popish inquisition, might be justified. With respect to the power of which many clergymen appeared so fond and so zealous, he owned the desire of power and riches was natural to all men; but that he had learned both from reason and from the gospel, that
<PB N="474" REF="4770"/>
this desire must be kept within due bounds, and not intrench upon the rights and liberties of their fellow-creatures and countrymen. After a long debate, the house agreed to leave out some clauses concerning the test and corporation-acts: then the bill was committed, and afterwards passed. In the lower house it met with violent opposition, in spite of which it was carried by the majority.</P>

<P>The king, on the seventeenth day of December, sent a message to the commons, importing, that all his endeavours to procure redress for the injuries done to his subjects by the king of Spain, having proved ineffectual, he had found it necessary to declare war against that monarch. When a motion was made for an address, to assure the king they would chearfully support him in the prosecution of the war, Mr. Shippen and some other members said, they did not see the necessity of involving the nation in a war on account of some g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vances of which the merchants complained, as these might be amicably redressed. Mr. Stanhope assured the house, that he had presented five and twenty memorials to the ministry of Spain on that subject, without success. Mr. Methuen accounted for the dilatory proceedings of the Spanish court in commercial affairs, by explaining the great variety of regulations in the several provinces and ports of that kingdom. It was suggested, that the ministry payed very little regard to the trade and interest of the nation; inasmuch as it appeared by the answer from a secretary of state to the letter of the marquis de Monteleone, that they would have overlooked the violation of the treaties of commerce, provided Spain had accepted the conditions stipulated in the qua∣druple alliance: that his majesty the king of Great-Britain did not seek to ag∣grandize himself by any new acquisition, but was rather inclined to sacrifice something of his own to procure the general qui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t and tranquillity of Europe. A member observed, that no body could tell how far that sacrifice would have extended; but, certainly it was a very uncommon stretch of condescension. This sacrifice was said to be the cession of Gibraltar and Portmahon, which the regent of France had offered to the king of Spain, provided he would accede to the quadruple alliance. Horatio Walpole observed, that the disposition of Sicily in favour of the emperor, was an infraction of the treaty of Utrecht; and his brother exclaimed against the injustice of attacking the Spanish fleet before a declaration of war. Notwithstanding all these arguments and objections, the majority agreed to the address; and such another was carried in the upper house without a division. The declaration of war against Spain was published with the usual solemnities; but this war was not a favourite of the people, and therefore did not produce those acclamations that were usual on such occa∣sions.</P>

<P>Mean while cardinal Alberoni employed all his intrigues, power, and industry, for the gratification of his revenge. He caused new ships to be built, the sea-ports to be put in a posture of defence, succours to be sent to Sicily, and the proper measures to be taken for the security of Sardinia. He, by means of the prince de Cellamare, the Spanish ambassador at Paris, caballed with the malcontents of that kingdom, who were numerous and powerful. A scheme was actually formed for seizing the regent, and securing the person of the king. The duke of Orleans owed the first intimation of this plot to king George, who gave him to understand, that a conspiracy was formed against his person and government. The regent immediately took measures for watching the
<PB N="475" REF="4780"/>
conduct of all suspected persons; but the whole intrigue was discovered by accident. The prince de Cellamare intrusted his dispatches to the abbé Porto∣carrero, and to a son of the marquis de Monteleone. They set out from Paris in a post-chaise, and were overturned. The postilion overheard Portocarrero say, he would not have lost his portmanteau for an hundred thousand pistoles. The man, at his return to Paris, gave notice to the government of what he had observed. The Spaniards being pursued, were overtaken and seized at Poitiers, with the portmanteau, in which the regent found two letters that made him acquainted with the particulars of the conspiracy. The prince de Cellamare was immediately conducted to the frontiers; the duke of Maine, the marquis de Pompadour, the cardinal de Polignac, and many other persons of distinction, were committed to different persons. The regent de∣clared war against Spain on the twenty-ninth day of December; and an army of six and thirty thousand men began its march towards that kingdom in January, under the command of the duke of Berwick.</P>

<P>Cardinal Alberoni had likewise formed a scheme in favour of the pretender. The duke of Ormond repairing to Madrid, held conferences with his eminence; and measures were concerted for exciting another insurrection in Great-Britain. The chevalier de St. George quitted Urbino by stealth; and embarking at Nettuno, landed at Cagliari in March. From thence he took his passage to Roses in Catalonia, and proceeded to Madrid, where he was received with great cordiality, and treated as king of Great-Britain. An armament had been equipped of ten ships of war and transports, having on board six thousand regular troops, with arms for twelve thousand men. The command of this fleet was bestowed on the duke of Ormond, with the title of captain-general of his most catholic majesty. He was provided with declarations in the name of that king, importing, that for many good reasons he had sent part of his land and sea-forces into England and Scotland, to act as auxiliaries to king James. King George, having received from the regent of France timely notice of this intended invasion, offered, by proclamation, rewards to those that should appre∣hend the duke of Ormond, or any gentleman embarked in that expedition. Troops were ordered to assemble in the north and in the west of England: two thousand men were demanded of the states-general: a strong squadron was equipped to oppose the Spanish armament; and the duke of Orleans made a proffer to king George of twenty battalions for his service.</P>

<P>His majesty having communicated to both houses of parliament the repeated advices he had received touching this projected descent, they promised to support him against all his enemies. They desired he would augment his forces by sea and land; and assured him they would make good the extraordi∣nary expence. Two thousand men were landed from Holland, and six bat∣talions of Imperialists from the Austrian Netherlands. The duke of Ormond sailed from Cadiz, and proceeded as far as Cape Finisterre, where his fleet was dispersed and disabled by a violent storm, which entirely defeated the purposed expedition. Two frigates, however, arrived in Scotland, with the earls Maris∣chal and Seaforth, the marquis of Tullibardine, some field-officers, three hun∣dred Spaniards, and arms for two thousand men. They were joined by a small body of Highlanders, and possessed themselves of Donan-castle. Against these adventurers general Wightman marched with a body of regular troops from
<PB N="476" REF="4790"/>
Inverness. They had taken possession of the pass of Glenshiel; but, at the ap∣proach of the king's forces, retired to the pass at Strachell, which they resolved to defend. They were attacked and driven from one eminence to another till night, when the Highlanders dispersed; and next day the Spaniards surrendered themselves prisoners of war. Marischal, Seaforth, and Tulhbardine, with some officers, retired to one of the western isles, in order to wait for an opportunity of being conveyed to the continent.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVI.</HEAD>
<P>On the last day of February the duke of Somerset represented, in the house of lords, that the number of peers being very much increased, espe∣cially since the union of the two kingdoms, it seemed absolutely necessary to take effectual measures for preventing the inconveniencies that might attend the creation of a great number of peers, to serve a present purpose; an expedient which had been actually taken in the late reign. He therefore moved, that a bill should be brought in to settle and limit the peerage, in such a manner, that the number of English peers should not be enlarged beyond six above the pre∣sent number, which, upon failure of male issue, might be supplied by new cre∣ations: that instead of the sixteen elective peers from Scotland, twenty-five should be made hereditary on the part of that kingdom; and, that this number, upon failure of heirs male, should be supplied from the other members of the Scottish peerage. This bill was intended as a restraint upon the prince of Wales, who happened to be at variance with the present ministry. The mo∣tion was supported by the duke of Argyle, now lord-steward of the houshold, the earls of Sunderland and Carlisle. It was opposed by the earl of Oxford, who said, that although he expected nothing from the crown, he would never give his vote for lopping off so valuable a branch of the prerogative, which enabled the king to reward merit and virtuous actions. The debate was adjourned to the second day of March, when earl Stanhope delivered a message from the king, intimating, that as they had under consideration the state of the British peerage, he had so much at heart the settling it upon such a foundation as might secure the freedom and constitution of parliaments in all future ages, that he was willing his prerogative should not stand in the way of so great and necessary a work. Another violent debate ensued between the two factions. The ques∣tion here, as in almost every other dispute, was not, Whether the measure pro∣posed was advantageous to the nation? but, Whether the Tory or the Whig in∣terest should predominate in parliament? Earl Cowper affirmed, that the part of the bill relating to the Scottish peerage was a manifest violation of the treaty of union, as well as a flagrant piece of injustice, as it would deprive persons of their right, without being heard, and without any pretence or forfeiture on their part. He observed, that the Scottish peers excluded from the number of the twenty-five, would be in a worse condition than any other subjects in the king∣dom; for they would be neither electing nor elected, neither representing nor<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> represented. These objections were over-ruled: several resolutions were taken agreeable to the motion; and the judges were ordered to prepare and bring in the bill. This measure alarmed the generality of the Scottish peers, as well as many English commoners, who saw in the bill the avenues of dignity and title shut up against them; and they did not fail to exclaim against it, as an in∣croachment upon the fundamental maxims of the constitution. Treatises were writ and published on both sides of the question; and a national clamour began
<PB N="477" REF="4800"/>
to arise, when earl Stanhope observed, in the house, that as the bill had raised strange apprehensions, he thought it adviseable to postpone the further conside∣ration of it till a more proper opportunity. It was accordingly dropped, and the parliament prorogued on the eighteenth day of April, on which occasion his majesty told both houses, that the Spanish king had acknowledged the pre∣tender.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1719.</NOTE> The king having appointed lords-justices to rule the kingdom in his absence, embarked in May for Holland, from whence he proceeded to Hanover, where he concluded a peace with Ulrica the new queen of Sweden. By this treaty Sweden yielded for ever to the royal and electoral house of Brunswick, the dutchies of Bremen and Verden, with all their dependencies: king George obliged himself to pay a million of rixdollars to the queen of Sweden; and to renew, as king of Great-Britain and elector of Hanover, the alliances formerly subsisting between his predecessors and that kingdom. He likewise mediated a peace between Sweden and his former allies the Danes, the Prussians, and the Poles. The czar, however, refused to give up his schemes of conquest. He sent his fleet to the Scheuron or Batses of Sweden, where his troops landing to the number of fifteen thousand, committed dreadful outrages; but, Sir John Norris, who commanded an English squadron in those seas, having orders to support the negotiations, and oppose any hostilities that might be committed, the czar, dreading the fate of the Spanish navy, thought proper to recal his fleet. In the Mediterranean admiral Byng acted with unwearied vigour in assisting the Impe∣rialists to finish the conquest of Sicily. The court of Vienna had agreed to send a strong body of forces to finish the reduction of that island; and the command in this expedition was bestowed upon the count de Merci, with whom Sir George Byng conferred at Naples. This admiral supplied them with ammunition and artillery from the Spanish prizes. He took the whole reinforcement under his convoy, and saw them safely landed in the bay of Patti, to the number of three thousand five hundred horse, and ten thousand infantry. Count Merci think∣ing himself more than a match for the Spanish forces commanded by the mar∣quis de Lede, attacked him in a strong camp at Franca-villa; and was repulsed with the loss of five thousand men, himself being dangerously wounded in the action. Here his army must have perished for want of provision, had not they been supplied by the English navy.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Admiral Byng no sooner learned the bad success of the attack at Franca-villa, than he embarked two battalions from the garrison of Melazzo, and about a thousand recruits, whom he sent under a convoy through the Faro to Scheso-bay, in order to reinforce the Imperial army. He afterwards assisted at a council of war with the German generals, who, in consequence of his ad∣vice, undertook the siege of Messina. Then he repaired to Naples, where he proposed to count Gallas the new viceroy, that the troops destined for the con∣quest of Sardinia should be first landed in Sicily, and co-operate towards the conquest of that island. The proposal was immediately dispatched to the court of Vienna. In the mean time the admiral returned to Sicily, and assisted in the siege of Messina. The town surrendered, the garrison retired into the citadel, and the remains of the Spanish navy which had escaped at Passaro, were now destroyed in the Mole. The emperor approved of the scheme proposed by the English admiral, to whom he wrote a very graciousletter, intimating, that he had
<PB N="478" REF="4810"/>
dispatched orders to the governor of Milan, to detach the troops designed for Sardinia to Vado, in order to be transported into Italy. The admiral charged himself with the performance of this service. Having furnished the Imperial army before Messina with another supply of cannon, powder, and shot, upon his own credit, he set sail for Vado, where he surmounted numberless difficulties started by the jealousy of count Bonneval, who was unwilling to see his troops destined for Sardinia, now diverted to another expedition, in which he could not enjoy the chief command. At length, admiral Byng saw the forces embarked, and convoyed them to Messina, the citadel of which surrendered in a few days after their arrival. By this time the marquis de Lede had fortified a strong post at Castro-Giovanne, in the centre of the island; and cantoned his troops about Aderno, Palermo, and Catanea. The Imperialists could not pretend to attack him in this situation, nor could they remain in the neighbourhood of Messina, on account of the scarcity of provisions. They would therefore have been ob∣liged to quit the island during the winter, had not the admiral undertaken to transport them by sea to Trapani, where they could extend themselves in a plentiful country. He not only executed this enterprize, but even supplied them with corn from Tunis, as the harvests of Sicily had been gathered into the Spanish magazines. It was the second day of March before the last em∣barkation of the Imperial troops were landed at Trapani.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="19" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIX.</HEAD>
<P>The marquis de Lede immediately retired with his army to Alcamo, from whence he sent his marechal de camp to count Merci and the English ad∣miral, with overtures for evacuating Sicily. The proposals were not disagree∣able to the Germans; but, Sir George Byng declared, that the Spaniards should not quit the island while the war continued, as he foresaw that these troops would be employed against France or England. He agreed, however, with count Merci, in proposing, that if the marquis would surrender Palermo, and retire into the middle part of the island, they would consent to an armistice for six weeks, until the sentiments of their different courts should be known. The marquis offered to surrender Palermo, in consideration of a suspension of arms for three months; but, while this negotiation was depending, he received advice from Madrid, that a general peace was concluded. Nevertheless, he broke off the treaty, in obedience to a secret order for that purpose. The king of Spain hoped to obtain the restitution of St. Sebastian's, Fontarabia, and other places taken in the course of the war, in exchange for the evacuation of Sicily. Hos∣tilities were continued until the admiral received advice from the earl of Stair at Paris, that the Spanish ambassador at the Hague had signed the quadruple alli∣ance. By the same courier packets were delivered to the count de Merci and the marquis de Lede, which last gave the admiral, and Imperial general to un∣derstand, that he looked upon the peace as a thing concluded; and was ready to treat for a cessation of hostilities. They insisted upon his delivering up Pa∣lermo; while he urged, that as their masters were in treaty for settling the terms of evacuating Sicily and Sardinia, he did not think himself authorised to agree to a ceffation, except on condition, that each party should remain on the ground they occupied, and expect further orders from their principals. After a fruitless interview between the three chiefs at the Cassine de Rossignola, the Imperial general resolved to undertake the siege of Palermo: with this view he decamped from Alcamo on the eighteenth day of April, and followed
<PB N="479" REF="4820"/>
the marquis de Lede, who retreated before him, and took possession of the ad∣vantageous posts that commanded the passes into the plain of Palermo; but count Merci with indefatigable diligence marched over the mountains, while the admiral coasted along-shore, attending the motions of the army. The Spa∣nish general perceiving the Germans advancing into the plain, retired under the cannon of Palermo; and fortified his camp with strong intrenchments. On the second day of May the Germans took one of the enemy's redoubts by surprize, and the marquis de Lede ordered all his forces to be drawn out to retake this for∣fication: both armies were on the point of engaging when a courier arrived in a felucca with a packet for the marquis, containing full powers to treat and agree about the evacuation of the island, and the transportation of the army to Spain. He forthwith drew off his army; and sent a trumpet to the general and admi∣ral, with letters, informing them of the orders he had received. Commissioners were appointed on each side, the negotiations begun, and the conventions signed in a very few days. The Germans were put in possession of Palermo; and the Spanish army marched to Termini, from whence they were transported to Barcelona.</P>

<P>The admiral continued in the Mediterranean until he had seen the islands of Sicily and Sardinia evacuated by the Spaniards, and the mutual cessions executed between the emperor and the duke of Savoy, in consequence of which, four battalions of Piedmontese troops were transported from Palermo to Sardinia, and took possession of Cagliari in the name of their master. In a word, admi∣ral Byng bore such a considerable share in this war of Sicily, that the fate of the island depended wholly on his courage, vigilance, and conduct. When he waited on his majesty at Hanover, he met with a very gracious reception. The king told him he had found out the secret of obliging his enemies as well as his friends; for the court of Spain had mentioned him in the most honour∣able terms, with respect to his candid and friendly deportment, in providing transports and other necessaries for the embarkation of their troops, and in protecting them from oppression. He was appointed treasurer of the navy, and rear-admiral of Great Britain: in a little time the king ennobled him by the title of viscount Torrington; he was declared a privy-counsellor; and af∣terwards made knight of the Bath, at the revival of that order. During these occurrences in the Mediterranean, the duke of Berwick advanced with the French army to the frontiers of Spain, where he took Fort Passage, and de∣stroyed six ships of war that were on the stocks: then he reduced Fontarabi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and St. Sebastian's, together with Port Antonio in the bottom of the Bay of Biscay. In this last exploit the French were assisted by a detachment of English seamen, who burned two large ships unfinished, and a great quantity of naval stores. The king of England, with a view to indemnify himself for the ex∣pence of the war, projected the conquest of Corunna in Biscay, and of Peru in South America. Four thousand men, commanded by lord Cobham, were em∣barked at the Isle of Wight, and sailed on the twenty-first day of September, under convoy of five ships of war, conducted by admiral Mighels. Instead of making an attempt upon Corunna, they reduced Vigo with very little difficulty; and Pont-a-Vedra submitted without resistance: here they found some brass artillery, small arms, and military stores, with which they returned to England. In the mean time captain Johnson, with two English ships of war, destroyed the
<PB N="480" REF="4830"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame number of Spanish ships in the port of Ribadeo to the eastward of Cape Ortegas; so that the naval power of Spain was totally ruined. The expedition to the West-Indies was prevented by the peace. Spain being oppressed on all sides, and utterly exhausted, Philip saw the necessity of a speedy pacification. He now perceived the madness of Alberoni's ambitious projects. That minister was personally disagreeable to the emperor, the king of England, and the re∣gent of France, who had declared they would hearken to no proposals while he should continue in office: the Spanish monarch, therefore, divested him of his employment; and ordered him to quit the kingdom in three weeks. The marquis de Beretti Landi, minister from the court of Madrid at the Hague, delivered a plan of pacification to the states: but it was rejected by the allies; and Philip was obliged at last to accede to the quadruple alliance.</P>

<P>On the fourteenth day of November king George returned to Eng∣land, and on the twenty-third opened the session of parliament with a speech, in which he told them, that all Europe, as well as Great-Britain, was on the point of being delivered from the calamities of war, by the influence of British arms and councils. He exhorted the commons to concert proper means for lessening the debts of the nation; and concluded with a panegyric upon his own government. It must be owned he had acted with equal vigour and delibera∣tion, in all the troubles he had encountered since his accession to the throne. The addresses of both houses were as warm as he could desire. They in parti∣cular extolled him for having interposed in behalf of the protestants of Hun∣gary, Poland, and Germany, who had been oppressed by the practices of the popish clergy; and presented to him memorials containing a detail of their grievances. He and all the other protestant powers warmly interceded in their favour; but the grievances were not redressed. The peerage-bill was now re∣vived by the duke of Buckingham; and, in spite of all opposition, passed through the house of lords. It had been projected by earl Stanhope, and eagerly supported by the earl of Sunderland; therefore Mr. Robert Walpole attacked it in the house of commons with extraordinary vehemence. Here too it was opposed by a considerable number of Whig members; and after warm de∣bates, rejected by a large majority. The next object that engrossed the at∣tention of the parliament, was a bill for better securing the dependency of Ire∣land upon the crown of Great-Britain. Maurice Annesley had appealed to the house of peers in England, from a decree of the house of peers in Ireland, which was reversed. The British peers ordered the barons of the exchequer in Ireland, to put Mr. Annesley in possession of the lands he had lost by the decree in that kingdom. The barons obeyed this order; and the Irish house of peers passed a vote against them, as having acted in derogation to the king's prerogative in his high court of parliament in Ireland, as also of the rights and privileges of that kingdom, and of the parliament thereof: they likewise ordered them to be taken into custody of the usher of the black-rod: they transmitted a long represen∣tation to the king, demonstrating their right to the final judicature of causes; and the duke of Leeds, in the upper house, urged fifteen reasons to support the claim of the Irish peers. Notwithstanding these arguments, the house of lords in England resolved, That the barons of the exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage, according to law, in support of his majesty's prerogative, and with fidelity to the crown of Great-Britain. They addressed the king to confer
<PB N="481" REF="4840"/>
on them some marks of his royal favour, as a recompence for the ill usage they had undergone. Finally, they prepared the bill, by which the Irish house of lords was deprived of all right to pass sentence, affirm, or reverse any judg∣ment or decree, given or made in any court within that kingdom. In the house of commons it was opposed by Mr. Pitt, Mr. Hunger<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, the lords Molesworth and Tyrconnel; but was carried by the majority, and received the royal assent.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXII.</HEAD>
<P>The king's having recommended to the commons the consideration of proper means for lessening the national debt, was a prelude to the famous South-sea act, which became productive of so much mischief and infatuation. The scheme was projected by Sir John Blunt, who had been bred a scrivener; and was possessed of all the cunning, plausibility, and boldness, requisite for such an undertaking. He communicated his plan to Mr. Aislabie, the chancellor of the exchequer, as well as to one of the secretaries of state. He answered all their objections; and the project was adopted. They foresaw their own private advantage in the execution of the design, which was imparted, in the name of the South-sea company, of which Blunt was a director, who influenced all their proceedings. The pretence for the scheme, was to discharge the national debt, by reducing all the funds into one. The bank and South-sea company outbid each other. The South-sea company altered their original plan, and offered such high terms to the government, that the proposals of the bank were rejected; and a bill was ordered to be brought into the house of commons, formed on the plan presented by the South-sea company. While this affair was in agita∣tion, the stock of that company rose from one hundred and thirty to near<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Corbet. Hist. Reg. Tindal. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> four hundred, in consequence of the conduct of the commons, who had re∣jected a motion for a clause in the bill, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ix what share in the capital stock of the company should be vested in those proprietors of the annuities who might vo∣luntarily subscribe; or how many years purchase in money they should receive in subscribing, at the choice of the proprietors. In the house of lords the bill was opposed by the lord North and Grey, the earl Cowper, the dukes of Whar∣ton, Buckingham, and other peers. They affirmed, it was calculated for in∣riching<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1720.</NOTE> a few and impoverishing a great number: that it countenanced the frau∣dulent and pernicious practice of stock-jobbing, which diverted the genius of the people from trade and industry: that it would give foreigners the opportu∣nity to double and treble the vast sums they had in the public funds; and they would be tempted to realize and withdraw their capital and immense gains to other countries; so that Great-Britain would be drained of its gold and silver: that the artificial and prodigious rise of the South-sea stock was a dangerous bait, which might decoy many unwary people to their ruin, alluring them by a false prospect of gain to part with the fruits of their industry, to purchase imaginary riches: that the addition of above thirty millions capital would give such power to the South-sea company, as might endanger the liberties of the nation; for, by their extensive interest they would be able to influence most, if not all the elections of the members; and consequently over rule the resolutions of the house of commons. Earl Cowper urged, that in all public bargains the persons in the administration ought to take care, that they shall be more advan∣tageous to the state than to private persons; but that a contrary method had been followed in the contract made with the South-sea company; for, should
<PB N="482" REF="4850"/>
the stocks be kept at the advanced price to which they had been raised by the oblique arts of stock-jobbing, either that company or its principal members would gain above thirty millions, of which no more than one fourth part would be given towards the discharge of the national debts. He apprehended, that the re-purchase of annuities would meet with insuperable difficulties; and, in such case, none but a few persons who were in the secret, who, had bought stocks at a low rate, and afterwards sold them at a high price, would in the end be gainers by the project. The earl of Sunderland answered their ob∣jections. He declared, that those who countenanced the scheme of the South-sea company, had nothing in view but the advantage of the nation. He owned, that the managers for that company had undoubtedly a prospect of pri∣vate gain, either to themselves or to their corporation; but, he said, when the scheme was accepted, neither the one nor the other could foresee that the stocks would have risen to such a height: that if they had continued as they were, the public would have had the far greater share of the advantage accruing from the scheme; and, should they be kept up to the present high price, it was but rea∣sonable, that the South-sea company should enjoy the profits procured to it by the wise management and industry of the directors, which would enable it to make large dividends, and thereby accomplish the purpose of the scheme. The bill passed without amendment or division; and, on the seventh day of April received the royal assent. By this act the South-sea company was authorised to take in by purchase or subscription, the irredeemable debts of the nation, stated at sixteen millions five hundred forty-six thousand four hundred eighty-two pounds, seven shillings, one penny farthing, at such times as they should find convenient before the first day of March of the ensuing year, and without any compulsion on any of the proprietors, at such rates and prices as should be agreed upon between the company and the respective proprietors. They were likeewise authorised to take in all the redeemable debts, amounting to the same sum as that of the irredeemables, either by purchase, by taking subscriptions, or by paying off the creditors. For the liberty of taking in the national debts, and increasing their capital stock accordingly, the company consented, that their present, and to be increased annuity, should be continued at five per cent. till Midsummer, in the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty-seven; from thence to be reduced to four per cent. and be redeemable by parliament. In consideration of this and other advantages expressed in the act, the company declared themselves willing to make such payments into the receipt of the ex∣chequer, as were specified for the use of the public, to be applied to the dis∣charge of the public debts incurred before Christmas, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen. The sums they were obliged to pay for the liberty of taking in the redeemable debts, four years and a half<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s purchase for all the long and short annuities that should be subscribed, and one year's purchase for such long annuities as should not be subscribed, amounted on the execution of the act to about seven millions. For enabling the company to raise this <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m, they were impowered to make calls for money from their members; to op<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n books of subscription; to grant annuities redeemable by the company; to borrow money upon any contract or bill under their common seal, or on the credit of their capital stock; to convert the money demanded of their members <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> additional stock, without, however, making any addition to the comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny's

annuities, payable out of the public duties. It was enacted, That out of the first monies arising from the sums payed by the company into the exchequer, such public debts carrying interest at five per cent. incurred before the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, founded upon any former act of parliament, as were now redeemable, or might be redeemed before the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two, should be discharged in the first place: then all the remainder should be applied towards paying off so much of the capital stock of the company as should then carry an interest of five per cent. It was likewise provided, That after Midsummer, in the year one thousand seven hun∣dred and twenty-seven, the company should not be payed off in any sums being less than one million at a time.</P>

<P>The heads of the royal-assurance and London-assurance companies, understanding that the civil list was considerably in arrears, offered to the mi∣nistry six hundred thousand pounds towards the discharge of that debt, on con∣dition of their obtaining the king's charter, with a parliamentary sanction for the establishment of their respective companies. The proposal was embraced; and the king communicated it in a message to the house of commons, desiring their concurrence. A bill was immediately passed, enabling his majesty to grant letters of incorporation to the two companies. It soon obtained the royal assent; and on the eleventh day of June an end was put to the session. This was the age of interested projects inspired by a venal spirit of adventure; the natural conse∣quence of that avarice, fraud, and profligacy, which the monied corporations had introduced. This, of all others is the most unfavourable aera for a historian. A reader of sentiment and imagination cannot be entertained or interested by a dry detail of such transactions as admit of no warmth, no colouring, no embel∣lishment; a detail which serves only to exhibit an inanimated picture of tasteless vice and mean degeneracy.</P>

<P>By this time an alliance offensive and defensive was concluded at Stockholm between king George and the queen of Sweden, by which his majesty engaged to send a fleet into the Baltic to act against the czar of Muscovy, in case that monarch should reject reasonable proposals of peace. Peter loudly complained of the insolent interposition of king George, alledging, that he had failed in his engagements, both as elector of Hanover and king of Great-Britain. His resident at London presented a long memorial on this subject, which was answered by the British and Hanoverian ministry. These recrimi∣nations served only to inflame the difference. The czar continued to prose∣cute the war; and at length concluded a peace without a mediator. At the in∣stances, however, of king George and the regent of France, a treaty of peace was signed between the queen of Sweden and the king of Prussia, to whom that princess ceded the city of Stetin, the district between the rivers Oder and Pehnne, with the isles of Wollin and Usedom. On the other hand, he engaged to join the king of Great-Britain in his endeavours to effect a peace between Sweden and Denmark, on condition that the Danish king should restore to queen Ulri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a that part of Pomerania which he had seized: he likewise pro∣mised to pay to that queen two millions of rixdollars, in consideration of the cessions she had made. The treaty between Sweden and Denmark was signed at Frederickstadt in the month of June, through the mediation of the king of
<PB N="484" REF="4870"/>
Great-Britain, who became guaranty for the Dane's keeping possession of Sles∣wick. He consented, however, to restore the Upper Pomerania, the isle of Rug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, the city of Wismar, and whatever he had taken from Sweden during the war, in consideration of Sweden's renouncing the exemption from toll in the Sound, and the two Belts; and paying to Denmark six hundred thousand sixdollars.</P>

<P>Sir John Norris had again sailed to the Baltic with a strong squa∣dron, to give weight to the king's mediation. When he arrived at Copenhagen he wrote a letter to prince Dolgorouki the czar's ambassador at the court of Den∣mark, signifying, that he and the king's envoy at Stockholm were vested with full powers to act jointly or separately in quality of plenipotentiaries, in order to effect a peace between Sweden and Muscovy, in the way of mediation. The prince answered, that the czar had nothing more at heart than peace and tran∣quillity; and, in case his Britannic majesty had any proposals to make to that prince, he hoped the admiral would excuse him from receiving them, as they might be delivered in a much more compendious way. The English fleet im∣mediately joined that of Sweden as auxiliaries; but they had no opportunity of acting against the Russian squadron, which secured itself in Revel. Ulrica queen of Sweden and sister to Charles XII. had married the prince of Hesse, and was extremely desirous that he should be joined with her in the administra∣tion of the regal power. She wrote a separate letter to each of the four states, desiring they would confer upon him the sovereignty; and, after some opposition from the nobles, he was actually elected king of Sweden. He sent one of his general officers to notify his elevation to the czar, who congratulated him upon his accession to the throne; and this was the beginning of a negotiation which ended in peace, and established the tranquillity of the North. In the midst of these transactions king George set out from England for his Hanoverian domi∣nions; but, before he departed from Great-Britain he was reconciled to the prince of Wales, through the endeavours of the duke of Devonshire and Mr. Walpole, who, with the earl Cowper, lord Townshend, Mr. Methuen, and Mr. Pulteney, was received into favour, and reunited with the ministry. The earls of Dorset and Bridgewater were promoted to the title of dukes; the lord vis∣count Castleton was made an earl; Hugh Boscawen was created a baron, and viscount Falmouth; and John Wallop baron and viscount of Lymington.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>While the king was involved at Hanover in a labyrinth of nego∣tiations, the South-sea scheme produced a kind of national delirium in his Eng∣lish dominions. Blunt the projector had taken the hint of his plan from the famous Mississipi scheme formed by Law, which in the preceding year had raised such a ferment in France, and intailed ruin upon many thousand families of that kingdom. In the scheme of Law there was something substantial. An ex∣clusive trade to Louisiana promised some advantage; though the design was defeated by the frantic eagerness of the people. Law himself became the dupe of the regent, who transferred the burthen of fifteen hundred millions of the king's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bts to the shoulders of the subjects; while the projector was sacrificed as the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ape-goat of political iniquity. The South-sea scheme promised no commer∣cial advantage of any consequence. It was buoyed up by nothing but the folly and rapaciousness of individuals, which became so blind and extravagant, that Blunt, with moderate talents, was able to impose upon the whole nation, and
<PB N="485" REF="4880"/>
make tools of the other directors, to serve his own purposes, and those of a few associates. When this projector found, that the South-sea stock did not rise according to his expectation upon the bill's being passed, he circulated a report, that Gibraltar and Portmahon would be exchanged for some places in Peru; by which means the English trade to the South-sea would be protected and en∣larged. This rumour, diffused by his emissaries, acted like a contagion. In five days the directors opened their books for a subscription of one million, at the rate of three hundred pounds for every hundred pounds capital. Persons of all ranks crowded to the house in such a manner, that the first subscription exceeded two millions of original stock. In a few days this stock advanced to three hundred and forty pounds; and the subscriptions were sold for double the price of the first payment. Without entering into a detail of the proceedings, or explaining the scandalous arts that were practised to inhance the value of the stock, and decoy the unwary, we shall only observe, that by the promise of pro∣digious dividends, and other infamous arts, the stock was raised to one thou∣sand; and the whole nation infected with the spirit of stock-jobbing to an astonishing degree. All distinctions of party, religion, sex, character, and cir∣cumstance, were swallowed up in this universal concern, or in some such pe∣cuniary project. Exchange-alley was filled with a strange concourse of states∣men and clergymen, churchmen and dissenters, Whigs and Tories, physici∣ans, lawyers, tradesmen, and even multitudes of females. All other pro∣fessions and employments were utterly neglected; and the people's attention wholly engrossed by this and other chimerical schemes, which were known by the denomination of Bubbles. New companies started up every day, under the countenance of the prime nobility. The prince of Wales was constituted go∣vernor of the Welch copper company: the duke of Chandois appeared at the head of the York-building company: the duke of Bridgewater formed a third, for building houses in London and Westminster. About an hundred such schemes were projected and put in execution, to the ruin of many thou∣sands. The sums proposed to be raised by these expedients amounted to three hundred millions sterling, which exceeded the value of all the lands in Eng∣land. The nation was so intoxicated with the spirit of adventure, that peo∣ple became a prey to the grossest delusion. An obscure projector pretending to have formed a very advantageous scheme, which, however, he did not explain, published proposals for a subscription, in which he promised, that in one month the particulars of his project should be disclosed. In the mean time he declared, that every person paying two guineas, should be intitled to a subscription for one hundred pounds, which would produce that sum yearly. In one forenoon this adventurer received a thousand of these subscriptions; and in the evening set out for another kingdom. The king, before his departure, had issued a pro∣clamation against these unlawful projects; the lords-justices afterwards dismissed all the petitions that had been presented for charters and patents; and the prince of Wales renounced the company of which he had been elected gover∣nor. The South-sea scheme raised such a flood of eager avidity and extrava∣gant hope, that the majority of the directors were swept along with it, even contrary to their own sense and inclination; but, Blunt and his accomplices still directed the stream.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>The infatuation prevailed till the eighth day of September, when the stock began to fall. Then did some of the adventurers awake from their delirium. The number of the sellers daily increased. On the twenty-ninth day of the month, the stock had sunk to one hundred and fifty: several eminent goldsmiths and bankers, who had lent great sums upon it, were obliged to stop payment and abscond. The ebb of this portentous tide was so violent, that it bore down every thing in its way; and an infinite number of families was over∣whelmed with ruin. Public credit sustained a terrible shock: the nation was thrown into a dangerous ferment; and nothing was heard but the ravings of grief, disappointment, and despair. Some principal members of the ministry were deeply concerned in these fraudulent transactions: when they saw the price of stock sinking daily, they employed all their influence with the bank to support the credit of the South-sea company. That corporation agreed, though with reluctance, to subscribe into the stock of the South-sea company, valued at four hundred per cent. three millions five hundred thousand pounds, which the company was to repay to the bank on Ladyday and Michaelmas of the en∣suing year. Books were opened at the bank to take in a subscription for the support of public credit; and considerable sums of money were brought in. By this expedient the stock was raised at first, and those who contrived it seized the opportunity to realize. But the bankruptcy of goldsmiths and the sword-blade company, from the fall of South-sea stock, occasioned such a run upon the bank, that the money was payed away faster than it could be received from the subscription. Then the South-sea stock sunk again; and the directors of the bank finding themselves in danger of being involved in that company's ruin, renounced the agreement, which they were under no obligation to per∣form. All expedients having failed, and the clamours of the people daily in∣creasing, expresses were dispatched to Hanover, representing the state of the nation, and pressing the king to return. He accordingly shortened his intended stay in Germany, and arrived in England on the eleventh day of November.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVIII</HEAD>
<P>The parliament being assembled on the eight day of Decem∣ber, his majesty expressed his concern for the unhappy turn of affairs, which had so deeply affected the public credit at home; and he earnestly desired the commons to consider of the most effectual and speedy methods to restore the national credit, and fix it upon a lasting establishment. The lower house was too much interested in the calamity to postpone the consideration of that sub∣ject. The members seemed to lay aside all party distinctions, and vie with each other in promoting an inquiry, by which justice might be done to the injured nation. They ordered the directors to produce an account of all their proceedings. Sir Joseph Jekyll moved, that a select committee might be ap∣pointed to examine the particulars of this transaction. Mr. Walpole, now paymaster of the forces, observed, that such a method would protract the in∣quiry, while the public credit lay in a bleeding condition. He told the house he had formed a scheme for restoring public credit; but, before he would communicate this plan, desired to know whether the subscriptions of public debts and incumbrances, money-subscriptions, and other contracts made with the South-sea company, should remain in the present state. After a warm debate, the question was carried in the affirmative, with this addition, <Q>“Unless altered for the ease and relief of the proprietors, by a general court of the
<PB N="487" REF="4900"/>
South-sea company, or set aside in due course of law.”</Q> Next day Walpole produced his scheme to ingraft nine millions of South-sea stock into the bank of England, and the like sum into the East-India company, on certain con∣ditions. The house voted, that proposals should be received from the bank, and those two companies, on this subject; and these being delivered, the com∣mons resolved, that an ingrossment of nine millions of the capital stock of the South-sea company, into the capital stock of the bank and East India com∣pany, as proposed by these companies, would contribute very much to the restoring public credit. A bill upon this resolution was brought in, passed through both houses, and received the royal assent. Another bill was enacted into a law, for restraining the sub-governor, deputy-governor, directors, trea∣surer, under-treasurer, cashier, secretary, and accountants, of the South-sea company, from quitting the kingdom, till the end of the next session of par∣liament; and for discovering their estates and effects, so as to prevent them from being transported or alienated. A committee of secrecy was chosen by ballot, to examine all the books, papers, and proceedings, relating to the ex∣ecution of the South-sea act.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The lords were not less eager than the commons, to prosecute this inquiry; though divers members in both houses were deeply involved in the guilt and infamy of the transaction. Earl Stanhope said the estates of the criminals, whether directors or not directors, ought to be confiscated to re∣pair the public losses. He was seconded by lord Carteret, and even by the earl of Sunderland. The duke of Wharton declared he would give up the best friend he had, should he be found guilty. He observed, that the nation had been plundered in a most flagrant and notorious manner; therefore they ought to find out and punish the offenders severely, without respect of persons. The sub and deputy-governors, the directors and officers of the South-sea company, were examined at the bar of the house. Then a bill was brought in, disabling them to enjoy any office in that company, or in the East-India company, or in the bank of England. Three brokers were likewise examined, and made great discoveries. Knight, the treasurer of the South-company, who had been intrusted with the secrets of the whole affair, thought proper to with∣draw himself from the kingdom. A proclamation was issued to apprehend him; and another for preventing any of the directors from escaping out of the kingdom. At this period, the secret committee informed the house of com∣mons, that they had already discovered a train of the deepest villainy and fraud that hell ever contrived to ruin a nation, which in due time they would lay before the house; in the mean while, they thought it highly necessary to secure the persons of some of the directors and principal officers of the South-sea company, as well as to seize their papers. An order was made to secure the books and papers of Knight, Surman, and Turner. The persons of Sir George Caswel, Sir John Blunt, Sir John Lambert, Sir John Fellows, and Mr. Grigsby, were taken into custody. Sir Theodore Jansen, Mr. Sawbridge, Sir Robert Chaplain, and Mr. Eyles, were expelled the house and apprehended. Mr. Aislablie resigned his employments of chancellor of the exchequer and lord of the treasury; and orders were given to remove all directors of the South-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a company from the places they possessed under the government.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="30" TYPE="section">
<PB N="488" REF="4910"/>
<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The lords, in the course of their examination, discovered that large portions of South-sea stock had been given to several persons in the ad∣ministration and house of commons, for promoting the passage of the South-sea act. The house immediately resolved, that this practice was a notorious and most dangerous species of corruption: that the directors of the South-sea company having ordered great quantities of their stock to be bought for the service of the company, when it was at a very high price, and on pretence of keeping up the price of stock; and at the same time several of the directors, and other officers belonging to the company, having, in a clandestine manner, sold their own stock to the company, such directors and officers were guilty of a notorious fraud and breach of trust; and their so doing was one great cause of the unhappy turn of affairs, that had so much affected public credit. Many other resolutions were taken against that infamous confederacy, in which, however, the innocent were confounded with the guilty. Sir John Blunt refusing to answer certain interrogations, a violent debate arose about the manner in which he should be treated. The duke of Wharton observed, that the government of the best princes was sometimes rendered intolerable to their subjects by bad ministers: he mentioned the example of Sejanus, who had made a division in the Imperial family, and rendered the reign of Claudius hateful to the Romans. Earl Stanhope conceiving this reflection was aimed at him, was seized with a transport of anger. He undertook to vindicate the ministry; and spoke with such vehemence as produced a violent headach, which obliged him to retire. He underwent proper evacuations, and seemed to re∣cover; but next day, in the evening, became lethargic, and being seized with a suffocation, instantly expired. The king deeply regreted the death of this favourite minister, which was the more unfortunate as it happened at such a critical conjuncture; and he appointed the lord Townshend to fill his place of secretary. Earl Stanhope was survived but a few days by the other secretary Mr. Craggs, who died of the small-pox on the sixteenth day of February. Knight, the cashier of the South-sea company, being seized at Tirlemont, by the vigilance of Mr. Gandot, secretary to Mr. Leathes, the British resident at Brussels, was confined in the citadel of Antwerp. Application was made to the court of Vienna, that he should be delivered up to such persons as might be appointed to receive him: but he had found means to interest the states of Brabant in his behalf. They insisted upon their privilege granted by charter, that no person apprehended for any crime in Brabant, should be tried in any other country. The house of commons expressed their indignation at this frivolous pretence: instances were renewed to the emperor; and in the mean time Knight escaped from the citadel of Antwerp.</P>

<DIV4 N="31" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXI.</HEAD>
<P>The committee of secrecy found, that before any subscription could be made, a fictitious stock of five hundred and seventy-four thousand pounds had been disposed of by the directors, to facilitate the passing the bill. Great part of this was distributed among the earl of Sunderland, Mr. Craggs senior, the dutchess of Kendal, the countess of Platen and her two nieces, Mr. secretary Craggs, and Mr. Aislabie chancellor of the exchequer. In conse∣quence of the committee's report, the house came to several severe though just resolutions, against the directors and officers of the South-sea company; and a
<PB N="489" REF="4920" MS="y"/>
bill was prepared for the relief of the unhappy sufferers. Mr. S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anhope, one of the secretaries of the treasury, charged, in the report, with having large quantities of stock and subscriptions, desired that he might have an opportunity to clear himself. His request was granted; and the affair being discussed, he was cleared by a majority of three voices. Fifty thousand pounds in stock had been taken by Knight for the use of the earl of Sunderland. Great part of the house entered eagerly into this inquiry; and a violent dispute ensued. The whole strength of the ministry was mustered in his defence. The majority declared him innocent: the nation in general was of another opinion. He resigned his place of first commissioner in the treasury, which was bestowed upon Mr. Robert Walpole; but he still retained the confidence of his master. With respect to Mr. Aislabie, the evidence appeared so strong against him, that the commons resolved, he had promoted the destructive execution of the South-sea scheme, with a view to his own exorbitant profit, and combined with the directors in their pernicious practices, to the ruin of public credit. He was expelled the house, and committed to the Tower. Mr. Craggs senior died of the lethargy before he underwent the censure of the house. Nevertheless, they resolved, that he was a notorious accomplice with Robert Knight, and some of the directors, in carrying on their scandalous practices; and therefore, that all the estate of which he was possessed, from the first day of December, in the preceding year, should be applied towards the relief of the unhappy suf∣ferers<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Hist. Reg. Polit. State. Deb. in Parl. Tindal.</NOTE> in the South-sea company. The directors, in obedience to the order of the house, delivered inventories of their estates, which were confiscated by act of parliament, towards making good the damages sustained by the com∣pany, after a certain allowance was deducted for each, according to his conduct and circumstances.</P>

<DIV4 N="32" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1721.</NOTE> The delinquents being thus punished by the forfeiture of their fortunes, the house converted their attention to means for repairing the mis∣chiefs which the scheme had produced. This was a very difficult task, on ac∣count of the contending interests of those engaged in the South-sea company, which rendered it impossible to relieve some but at the expence of others. Several wholesome resolutions were taken, and presented with an address to the king, explaining the motives of their proceedings. On the twenty-ninth day of July, the parliament was prorogued for two days only. Then his majesty going to the house of peers, declared, that he had called them together again so suddenly, that they might resume the consideration of the state of public credit. The commons immediately prepared a bill upon the resolutions they had taken. The whole capital stock, at the end of the year one thousand seven hundred and twenty, amounted to about thirty-seven millions eight hundred thousand pounds. The stock allotted to all the pro∣prietors did not exceed twenty four millions five hundred thousand pounds; the remaining capital stock belonged to the company in their corporate ca∣pacity. It was the profit arising from the execution of the South-sea scheme; and out of this the bill enacted, that seven millions should be payed to the public. The present act likewise directed several additions to be made to the stock of the proprietors, out of that possessed by the company in their own right: it made a particular distribution of stock, amounting to two millions two hundred thousand pounds; and, upon remitting five millions of the seven
<PB N="490" REF="4930"/>
to be payed to the public, annihilated two millions of their capital. It was enacted, that after these distributions, the remaining capital stock should be divided among all the proprietors. This dividend amounted to thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence per cent. and deprived the company of eight millions nine hundred thousand pounds. They had lent above eleven millions on stock unredeemed. Of which the parliament discharged all the debtors upon their paying ten per cent. Upon this article the company's loss exceeded six millions nine hundred thousand pounds; for many debtors re∣fused to make any payment. The proprietors of the stock loudly complained of their being deprived of two millions; and the parliament, in the sequel, re∣vived that sum which had been annihilated. While this affair was in agita∣tion, petitions from counties, cities, and boroughs, in all parts of the king∣dom, were presented to the house, crying for justice against the villainy of the directors. Pamphlets and papers were daily published on the same sub∣ject; so that the whole nation was exasperated to the highest pitch of resent∣ment. By the wise and vigorous resolutions of the parliament, the South-sea company was soon in a condition to fulfil their engagements with the public; the ferment of the people subsided, and the credit of the nation was restored.</P>

<P>DURING the infatuation produced by this infamous scheme, luxury, vice, and profligacy, increased to a shocking degree of extrava∣gance. The adventurers, intoxicated by their imaginary wealth, pampered themselves with the rarest dainties, and the most expensive wines that could be imported: they purchased the most sumptuous furniture, equipage, and apparel, though without taste or discernment: they indulged their criminal passions to the most scandalous excess: their discourse was the language of pride, inso∣lence, and the most ridiculous ostentation: they affected to scoff at religion and morality; and even to set heaven at defiance. The earl of Nottingham complained, in the house of lords, of the growth of atheism, profaneness, and immorality; and a bill was brought in for suppressing blasphemy and profane∣ness. It contained several articles seemingly calculated to restrain the liberty granted to nonconformists, by the laws of the last session: for that reason it met with violent opposition. It was supported by the archbishop of Canter∣bury, the earl of Nottingham, the lords Bathurst and Trevor, the bishops of
<PB N="492" REF="4950"/>
London, Winchester, Litchfield, and Coventry. One of these said, he verily believed the present calamity, occasioned by the South-sea project, was a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God on the blasphemy and profaneness of the nation. Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> replied, <Q>“That noble peer must then be a great sinner, for he has lost considerably by the South-sea scheme.”</Q> The duke of Wharton, who had rendered himself famous by his wit and profligacy, said he was not insensible of the common opinion of the town concerning himself; and gladly seized this opport<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of vindicating his character, by declaring he was far from being a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asphemy, or an enemy to religion. On the other hand, he could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but oppose the bill, because he conceived it to be repugnant to the holy <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>pture. Then pulling an old family-bible from his pocket, he quoted se∣veral passages from the epistles of St. Peter and St. Paul; concluding that the bill might be thrown out. The earl of Peterborough declared, that though he was for a parliamentary king, yet he did not desire to have a parliamentary god, or a parliamentary religion; and, should the house declare for one of this kind, he would go to Rome and endeavour to be chosen a cardinal; for he had rather sit in the conclave than with their lordships upon those terms. After a vehement debate, the bill was postponed to a long day, by a consider∣able majority.</P>

<P>The season was far advanced before the supplies were granted; and at length they were not voted with that chearfulness and good humour which the majority had hitherto manifested on such occasions. On the sixteenth day of June, the king sent a message to the house of commons, importing, that he had agreed to pay a subsidy to the crown of Sweden, and he hoped they would enable him to make good his engagements. The leaders of the oppo∣sition took fire at this intimation. They desired to know whether this sub∣sidy, amounting to seventy two thousand pounds, was to be payed to Sweden over and above the expence of maintaining a strong squadron in the Baltic? Lord Molesworth observed, that, by our late conduct, we were become the allies of the whole world, and the bubbles of all our allies; for we were obliged to pay them well for their assistance. He affirmed, that the treaties which had been made with Sweden, at different times, were inconsistent and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that our late engagements with that crown were contrary to the treaties subsisting with Denmark, and directly opposite to the measures formerly con∣certed with the czar of Muscovy. He said, that in order to engage the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to yield what he had gained in the course of the war, the king of Prussia <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to give up Stetin, and the elector of Hanover restore Bremen and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that, after all, England had no business to intermeddle with the affairs of the empire: that we reaped little or no advantage by our trade to the Baltic but that of procuring naval stores: he owned that hemp was a very necessary <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mmodity, particularly at this juncture; but he insisted, that if due en∣couragement were given to some of our plantations in America, we might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from thence at a much cheaper rate than from Sweden and Norway. Notwithstanding these arguments, the Swedish supply was granted; and, in about in three weeks, their complaisance was put to another proof. They <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re given to understand, by a second message, that the debts of the civil hit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to five hundred and fifty thousand pounds; and his majesty hoped they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him to raise that sum upon the revenue, as he proposed
<PB N="493" REF="4960"/>
it should be replaced to the civil list, and reimbursed by a deduction from the salaries and wages of all officers, and the pensions and other payments from the crown. A bill was prepared for this purpose, though not without warm opposition; and, at the same time, an act passed for a general pardon. On the tenth day of August, the king closed the session with a speech, in which he expressed his concern for the sufferings of the innocent, and a just indigna∣ton against the guilty, with respect to the South-sea scheme. These professions were judged necessary to clear his own character, which had incurred the suspicion of some people, who whispered that he was not altogether free from con∣nexions with the projectors of that design; that the emperor had, at his desire, refused to deliver up Knight; and that he favoured the directors and their ac∣complices.</P>

<P>The lords Townshend and Carteret were now appointed secretaries of state; and the earl of Ilay was vested with the office of lord privy-seal of Scotland. In June the treaty of peace between Great Britain and Spain was signed at Madrid. The contracting parties engaged to restore mutually all the effects seized and confiscated on both sides. In particular, the king of Eng∣land promised to restore all the ships of the Spanish fleet which had been taken in the Mediterranean, or the value of them, if they were sold. He likewise promised, in a secret article, that he would no longer interfere in the affairs of Italy; and the king of Spain made an absolute cession of Gibraltar and Port∣mahon. At the same time, a defensive alliance was concluded between Great Britain, France, and Spain. All remaining difficulties were referred to a con∣gress at Cambray, where they hoped to consolidate a general peace, by deter∣mining all differences between the emperor and his catholic majesty. In the mean time, the powers of Great Britain, France, and Spain, engaged, by virtue of the present treaty, to grant to the duke of Parma a particular protection for the preservation of his territories and rights, and for the support of his dignity. It was also stipulated, that the states-general should be invited to ac∣cede to this alliance. The congress at Cambray was opened; but the demands on both sides were so high, that it proved ineffectual. In the mean time, the peace between Russia and Sweden was concluded, on condition that the czar should retain Livonia, Ingria, Estonia, part of Carelia, and of the territory of Wyburg, Riga, Revel, and Narva, in consideration of his restoring part of Finland, and paying two millions of rixdollars to the king of Sweden. The personal animosity subsisting between king George and the czar seemed to in∣crease. Bastagif, the Russian resident at London, having presented a memo∣rial that contained some unguarded expressions, was ordered to quit the king∣dom in a fortnight. The czar published a declaration at Petersburg, com∣plaining of this outrage, which, he said, ought naturally to have engaged him to use reprisals; but, as he perceived it was done without any regard to the concerns of England, and only in favour of the Hanoverian interest, he was unwilling that the English nation should suffer for a peace of injustice in which they had no share. He therefore granted to them all manner of security, and free liberty to trade in all his dominions. To finish this strange tissue of ne∣gotiations, king George concluded a treaty with the Moors of Afric, against which the Spaniards loudly exclaimed.</P>

The king, in his speech at opening the session of parliament, on the nineteenth day of October, intimated the pacification of the North, by the conclusion of the treaty between Muscovy and Sweden. He desired the house of commons to consider of means for easing the duties upon the imported commodities used in the manufactures of the kingdom. He observed, that the nation might be supplied with naval stores from our own colonies in North America; and that their being em∣ployed in this useful and advantageous branch of commerce would divert them from setting up manufactures which directly interfered with those of Great-Britain. He expressed a desire that, with respect to the supplies, his people might reap some immediate benefit from the present circumstances of affairs abroad; and he earnestly recommended to their consideration, means for pre∣venting the plague, particularly by providing against the practice of smug∣gling.</P>

<P>One of the first objects that attracted the attention of the upper house, was Law the famous projector. The resentment of the people on account of his Mississippi scheme, had obliged him to leave France. He retired to Italy; was said to have visited the pretender at Rome, from whence he re∣paired to Hanover; and returned to England from the Baltic, in the fleet commanded by Sir John Norris. The king favoured him with a private audience: he kept open house, and was visited by great numbers of persons of the first quality. Earl Coningsby represented, in the house of lords, that he could not but entertain some jealousy of a person who had done so much mis∣chief in a neighbouring kingdom; who being immensely rich, might do a great deal more hurt here, by tampering with those who were grown desperate, in consequence of being involved in the calamity occasioned by the fatal imi∣tation of his pernicious projects. He observed, that this person was the more dangerous, as he had renounced his natural affection to his country, his al∣legiance to his lawful sovereign, and his religion, by turning roman catholic. Lord Carteret replied, that Mr. Law had, many years ago, the misfortune to kill a gentleman in a duel; but that having at last received the benefit of the king's clemency, and the appeal lodged by the relations of the deceased being taken off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he was come over to plead his majesty's pardon. He said there was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o law to keep any <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nglishman out of his country; and, as Mr. Law was a subject of Great-Britain, it was not even in the king's power to hinder him from coming over. After some dispute<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the subject was dropped, and this great projector pleaded his pardon in the king's-bench, according to the usual form.</P>

<P>The ministry had by this time secured such a majority in both houses, as enabled them to carry any point without the least difficulty. Some chiefs of the opposition they had brought over to their measures, and among the rest lord Harcourt, who was created a viscount, and gratified with a pension of four thousand pounds. Nevertheless, they could not shut the mouths of the minority, who still preserved the privilege of complaining. Great debates were occasioned by the navy-debt, which was increased to one million seven hundred thousand pounds. Some members in both houses affirmed, that such extraordinary expence could not be for the immediate service of Great-Britain; but, in all probability, for the preservation of foreign acquisitions. The mi∣nisters answered, that near two-thirds of the navy-debts were contracted in the late reign: and the parliament acquiesced in this declaration; though, in reality, the navy-debt had been unnecessarily increased by keeping seamen in pay during the winter, and sending fleets to the Mediterranean and Baltic, in order to sup∣port the interests of Germany. The duke of Wharton moved, that the treaty with Spain might be layed before the house. The earl of Sunderland said it con∣tained a secret article, which the king of Spain desired might not be made pu∣blic, until after the treaty of Cambray should be discussed. The question was put, and the duke's motion rejected. The earl of Strafford asserted, that as the war with Spain had been undertaken without necessity or just provoca∣tion, so the peace was concluded without any benefit or advantage: that, contrary to the law of nations, the Spanish fleet had been attacked without any declaration of war; even while a British minister and a secretary of state were treating amicably at Madrid: that the war was neither just nor politic, since it interrupted one of the most valuable branches of the English commerce, at a time when the nation groaned under the pressure of heavy debts, incurred by the former long expensive war. He therefore moved for an address to his majesty, desiring, that the instructions given to Sir George Byng, now lord Torrington, should be layed before the house. This motion being likewise, upon the question, rejected, a protest was entered. They voted an ad∣dress, however, to know in what manner the king had disposed of the ships taken from the Spaniards. Disputes arose also from the bill to prevent in∣fection. Earl Cowper represented, that the removal of persons to a Lazaret, or pest-house, by order of the government, and the drawing lines and trenches round places infected, were powers unknown to the British constitution, in∣consistent with the lenity of a free government; such as could never be wisely or usefully put in practice; the more odious because copied from the arbitrary government of France; and impracticable, except by military compulsion. These obnoxious clauses were accordingly appealed, though not without great opposition. Indeed nothing can be more absurd than a constitution that will not admit of just and necessary laws and regulations to prevent the dire con∣sequences of the worst of all calamities. Such restrictions, instead of favour∣ing the lenity of a free government, would be the most cruel imposition that could be layed on a free people, as it would act in diametrical opposition to the great principle of society, which is the preservation of the individual.</P>

<PB N="496" REF="4990"/>
with their request: but the bill gave rise to a warm debate among the peers. Dr. Atterbury, bishop of Rochester, said he did not know why such a distinguishing mark of indulgence should be allowed to a set of people who were hardly christians. He was supported by the archbishop of York, the earl of Strafford, and the lord North and Grey. A petition was presented against the bill by the London clergy, who expressed a serious concern le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the minds of good men should be grieved and wounded, and the enemies of Christianity triumph, when they should see such condescension made by a christian legislature, to a set of men who renounce the divine institutions of Christ; particularly that by which the faithful are in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiated into his religion, and denominated christians. The petition, though presented by the archbishop of York, was branded by the ministry as a seditious libel, and rejected by the majority.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>22.</NOTE> In the beginning of May, the king is said to have received of the duke of Orleans, full and certain information of a fresh conspiracy formed against his person and government. A camp was immediately formed in Hyde-park. All military officers were ordered to repair to their respective commands. Lieutenant-general Maccartney was dispatched to Ireland, to bring over some troops from that kingdom. Some suspected persons were ap∣prehended in Scotland: the states of Holland were desired to have their auxiliary or guaranty troops in readiness to be embarked; and colonel Churchill was sent to the court of France with a private commission. The apprehension raised by this supposed plot, affected the public credit. South-sea stock began to fall; and crouds of people called in their money from the bank. The lord Townshend wrote a letter to the mayor of London, by the king's command, signifying his majesty's having received unquestionable advices, that several of his subjects had entered into a wicked conspiracy, in concert with trai∣tors abroad, for raising a rebellion in favour of a popish pretender; but that he was firmly assured the authors of it neither were nor would be supported by any foreign power. This letter was immediately answered by an affectionate address from the court of aldermen; and the example of London was fol∣lowed by many other cities and boroughs. The king had determined to visit Hanover, and actually settled a regency, in which the prince of Wales was not
<PB N="497" REF="5000"/>
included: but now this intended journey was layed aside: the court was removed to Kensington, and the prince retired to Richmond. The bishop of Rochester having been seized, with his papers, was examined before a committee of the council, who committed him to the Tower for high-treason. The earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, Mr. Cochran and Mr. Smith, from Scot∣land, and Mr. Christopher Layer, a young gentleman of the Temple, were confined in the same place. Mr. George Kelly, an Irish clergyman, Mr. Robert Cotton of Huntingtonshire, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Fleetwood, Neynoe an Irish priest, and several persons, were taken into custody; and Mr. Shippen's house was searched. After bishop Atterburry had remained a fortnight in the Tower, Sir Constantine Phipps presented a petition to the court at the Old Bailey, in the name of Mrs. Morris, that prelate's daughter, praying, that, in consider∣ation of the bishop's ill state of health, he might be either brought to a speedy trial, bailed, or discharged: but this was over-ruled. The churchmen through the whole kingdom were filled with indignation at the confinement of a bishop, which they said was an outrage upon the church of England, and the episco∣pal order. Far from concealing their sentiments on this subject, the clergy ventured to offer up public prayers for his health, in almost all the churches and chapels of London and Westminster. In the mean time, the king, at∣tended by the prince of Wales, made a summer-progress through the western counties.</P>

<P>The new parliament being assembled on the ninth day of October, his majesty made them acquainted with the nature of the conspiracy. He said the conspirators had, by their emissaries, made the strongest instances for succours from foreign powers; but were disappointed in their expectations. Nevertheless, confiding in their numbers, they resolved once more, upon their own strength, to attempt the subversion of his government. He said they had provided considerable sums of money, engaged great numbers of officers from abroad, secured large quantities of arms and ammunition; and, had not the plot been timely discovered, the whole nation, and particularly the city of London, would have been involved in blood and confusion. He expatiated upon the mildness and integrity of his own government; and inveighed against the ingratitude, the implacability, and madness, of the disaffected; concluding with an assurance, that he would steadily adhere to the constitution in church and state, and continue to make the laws of the realm the rule and measure of all his actions. Such addresses were presented by both houses as the fears and attachment of the majority may be supposed to have dictated on such an oc∣casion. A bill was brought into the house of lords, for suspending the habeas corpus act for a whole year: but they were far from being unanimous in agreeing to such an unusual length of time. By this suspension, they, in ef∣fect, vested the ministry with a dictatorial power over the liberties of the people.</P>

the council, and committed to the Tower on suspicion of high-treason. On the sixteenth day of November, the king sent to the house of peers the original, and printed copy, of a declaration signed by the pretender.

their enterprize till the breaking up of the camp; and, in the mean time, employed their agents to corrupt and seduce the officers and soldiers of the army: that it appeared from several letters and circumstances, that the late duke of Ormond, the duke of Norfolk, the earl of Orrery, the lord North and Grey, and the bishop of Rochester, were concerned in this conspiracy: that their acting agents were Christopher Layer and John Plunket, who tra∣velled with him to Rome; Dennis Kelly, George Kelly, and Thomas Carte, nonjuring clergymen; Neynoe the Irish priest, who by this time was drowned in the river Thames, in attempting to make his escape from the messenger's house, Mrs. Spilman, alias Yallop, and John Sample.</P>

<P>This pretended conspiracy, in all likelihood, extended no farther than the first rudiments of a design that was never digested into any regular form; otherwise the persons said to be concerned in it must have been infa∣tuated to a degree of frenzy: for they were charged with having made ap∣plication to the regent of France, who was well known to be intimately con∣nected with the king of Great-Britain. The house of commons, however, re∣solved, that it was a detestable and horrid conspiracy, for raising a rebellion, seizing the Tower and the city of London, laying v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olent hands upon the persons of his most sacred majesty and the prince of Wales, in order to sub∣vert our present happy establishment in church and state, by placing a popish pretender upon the throne: that it was formed and carried on by persons of figure and distinction, and their agents and instruments, in conjunction with traitors abroad. Bills were brought in and passed, for inflicting pains and pe∣nalties against John Plunket and George Kelly, who were by these acts to be kept in close custody during his majesty's pleasure, in any prison in Great-Britain; and that they should not attempt to escape on pain of death, to be inflicted upon them and their assistants. Mr. Yonge made a motion for a bill of the same nature against the bishop of Rochester. This was immediately brought into the house, though Sir William Wyndham affirmed there was no evidence against him but conjectures and hearsays. The bishop wrote a letter to the speaker, importing, that though conscious of his own innocence, he should decline giving the house any trouble that day, contenting himself with the opportunity of making his defence before another, of which he had the honour to be a member. Counsel being heard for the bill, it was committed to a grand committee on the sixth day of April, when the majority of the Tory members quitted the house. It was then moved, that the bishop should be deprived of his office and benefice, and banished the kingdom for ever: Mr. Lawson and Mr. Oglethorpe spoke in his favour.</P>

<P>The bill being passed and sent up to the lords, the bishop was brought to his trial before them on the ninth of May. Himself and his counsel having been heard, the lords proceeded to consider the articles of the bill; when they read it a third time, a motion was made to pass it, and then a long and warm debate ensued. Earl Powlet demonstrated the danger and injustice of swerving in such an ext<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aordinary manner from the fixed rules of evidence. The duke of Wharton having summed up the depositions, and proved the insufficiency of them, concluded with saying, that let the consequences be what they would, he hoped such a helli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h stain would never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ully the lustre and glory of that illustrious house, as to condemn a man without the least evidence.
<PB N="500" REF="5030"/>
The lord Bathurst spoke against the bill with equal strength and eloquence. He said, if such extraordinary proceedings were countenanced, he saw nothing remaining for him and others to do, but to retire to their country-houses, and there, if possible, quietly enjoy their estates within their own families, since the least correspondence, the least incercepted letter, might be made criminal. He observed, that cardinal Mazarin boasted, that if he had but two lines of any man's writing, he could, by means of a few circumstances, attested by witnesses, deprive him of life at his pleasure. Turning to the bench of bishops, who had been generally unfavourable to Dr. Atterbury, he said, he could hardly account for the inveterate hatred and malice some persons bore the learned and ingenious bishop of Rochester, unless they were intoxicated with the infatuation of some savage Indians, who believed they inherited not only the spoils, but even the abilities of any great enemy whom they had killed in battle. The bill was sup∣ported by the duke of Argyle, the earl of Seafield, and the lord Lechmere, who was answered by earl Cowper. This nobleman observed, that the strongest argument urged in behalf of the bill, was necessity; but, that for his part, he saw no necessity that could justify such unprecedented, and such dangerous pro∣ceedings, as the conspiracy had above twelve months before been happily dis∣covered, and the effects of it prevented: that besides the intrinsic weight and strength of the government, the hands of those at the helm had been still fur∣ther fortified by the suspension of the habeas corpus act, and the additional troops which had been raised. He said, the known rules of evidence, as layed down at first, and established by the law of the land, were the birthright of every subject in the nation, and ought to be constantly observed, not only in the inferior courts of judicature, but also in both houses of parliament, till altered by the legislature: that the admitting of the precarious and uncertain evidence of the clerks of the post-office, was a very dangerous precedent. In former times it was thought very grievous, that in capital cases a man should be affected by similitude of hands; but here the case was much worse, since it was allowed, that the clerks of the post-office could carry the similitude of hands four months in their minds. He applauded the bishop's noble deport∣ment in declining to answer before the house of commons, whose proceedings in this unprecedented manner, against a lord of parliament, was such an in∣croachment on the prerogative of the peerage, that if they submitted to it, by passing the bill, they might be termed the last of British peers, for giving up their antient privileges. The other party were not so sollicitous about answering reasons, as eager to put the question; when the bill passed, and a protest was entered. By this act the bishop was deprived of all offices, benefices, and dig∣nities; and rendered incapable of enjoying any for the future: he was ba∣nished the realm, and subjected to the pains of death, in case he should return, as were all persons that should correspond with him during his exile. Doctor Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd the celebrated physician, who was a member of the house, and had ex∣erted himself strenuously in behalf of the bishop, was now taken into custody on suspicion of treasonable practices.</P>

<P>The next object that excited the refentment of the commons, was the scheme of a lottery to be drawn at Harburgh in the king's German domi∣nions. The house appointed a committee to inquire into this and other lotteries, at that time on foot in London. The scheme was published, on pretence of
<PB N="501" REF="5040"/>
raising a subscription for maintaining a trade between Great-Britain and the king's territories on the Elbe; but, it was a mysterious scene of iniquity, which the com∣mittee, with all their penetration, could not fully discover. They reported, however, that it was an infamous fraudulent undertaking, whereby many unwary persons had been drawn in, to their great loss: and, that the manner of carrying it on had been a manifest violation of the laws of the kingdom: that the managers and agents of this lottery had, without any authority for so doing, made use of his ma∣jesty's royal name, thereby to give countenance to the infamous project, and induce his majesty's subjects to engage or be concerned therein. A bill was brought in to suppress this lottery; and to oblige the managers of it to make restitution of the money they had received from the contributors. At the same time the house resolved, That John lord viscount Barrington had been notoriously guilty of promoting, abetting, and carrying on that fraudulent undertaking; for which offence he should be expelled the house. The court of Vienna having erected an East-India company at O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend, upon a scheme formed by one Colebrook an English merchant, Sir Nathaniel Gould represented to the house of commons, the great detriment which the English East-India company had already received, and was likely further to sustain by this O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tend company. The house immediately resolved, That for the subjects of this kingdom to subscribe, or be concerned in encouraging any subscription, to promote an East-India com∣pany now erecting in the Austrian Netherlands was a high crime and misde∣meanour: and a law was enacted for preventing British subjects from engaging in that enterprize. By another act relating to the South-sea company, the two millions of stock which had been annihilated, were revived, added to the capi∣tal, and divided among the proprietors. A third law passed, for the more effec∣tual execution of justice in a part of Southwark, called the Mint, where a great number of debtors had taken sanctuary, on the supposition that it was a privi∣leged place. On the twenty-seventh of May the session was closed, with a speech that breathed nothing but panegyric, acknowledgment, and affection, to a parliament which had complied with all his majesty's wishes.</P>

<P>His majesty having ennobled the son of Mr. Robert Walpole, in consideration of the father's services, made a good number of church-promo∣tions, admitted the imprisoned lords and gentlemen to bail, granted a pardon to lord Bolingbroke, and ordered the bishop of Rochester to be conveyed to the continent, set out himself for Hanover, leaving the administration of his king∣doms in the hands of a regency, lord Harcourt being one of the justices. The king was attended by the two secretaries, the lords Townshend and Carteret, who were counted able negotiators. The affairs of the continent had begun to take a new turn. The interests and connexions of the different princes were become perplexed and embarrassed; and king George resolved to unravel them by dint of negotiation. Understanding that a treaty was on the carpet between the czar and the king of Sweden, favourable to the duke of Holstein's preten∣sions to Sle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wick, the possession of which the elector of Hanover had guarantied to Denmark, his majesty began to be in pain for Bremen and Verden. The regent of France and the king of Spain had now compromised all differences; and their reconciliation was cemented by a double marriage between Philip's sons and the regent's daughters. The former proposed new treaties to Eng∣land; but insisted upon the restitution of Gibraltar and Portmahon, as well as
<PB N="502" REF="5050"/>
upon the king's openly declaring against the Ostend company. His Britannic majesty was apprehensive, that should the emperor be hard pressed on that sub∣ject, he might join the czar and the king of Sweden, and promote their designs in favour of the duke of Holstein. On the other hand, all the Italian powers exclaimed against the treaty of London. The pope had protested against any thing that might have been decided at Cambray to the prejudice of his right. Memorials to the same effect had been presented by the king of Sardinia, the dukes of Tuscany, Parma, and Modena. France and Spain were inclined to support them against the house of Austria. Europe seemed to be on the eve of a new war. King George was intangled in such a variety of treaties and interests, that he knew not well how to extricate himself from the troublesome engage∣ments he had contracted. By declaring for the emperor he must have counte∣nanced the new establishment at Ostend, which was so prejudicial to his British subjects, and incurred the resentment of France, Spain, and their allies of Italy. In renouncing the interest of the emperor, he would have exposed his German dominions. In vain he exhorted the emperor to relax in his disputes with Spain, and give up the Ostend company, which was so detrimental and disagreeable to his faithful allies<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the court of Vienna promised in general to observe the treaties which it had concluded; but, declined entering into any particular dis∣cussion; so that all his majesty's endeavours issued in contracting closer connex∣ions with Prussia and Denmark. All those negotiations carried on, all those treaties concluded by king George, with almost every prince and state in Chri∣stendom, which succeeded one another so fast, and appear, at first view, so in∣tricate and unaccountable, were founded upon two simple and natural princi∣ples, namely, the desire of ascertaining his acquisitions as elector of Hanover; and his resolution to secure himself against the disaffection of his British sub∣jects, and the efforts of the pretender.</P>

<P>Great Britain, at this period, enjoyed profound tranquillity. Ireland was a little ruffled by an incident which seems to have been misrepresented to the people of that kingdom. William Wood had obtained a patent for fur∣nishing Ireland with copper currency, in which it was deficient. A great cla∣mour was raised against this coin. The parliament of that kingdom, which met in September, resolved, That it would be prejudicial to the revenue, de∣structive of trade, and of dangerous consequence to the rights of the sub∣ject: That the patent had been obtained by misrepresentation: That the half∣pence wanted weight: That even, if the terms of the patent had been complied with, there would have been a great loss to the nation: That granting the power of coinage to a private person had ever been highly prejudicial to the kingdom; and would at all times be of dangerous consequence. Addresses from both houses were presented to the king on this subject. The affair was referred to the lords of the privy-council of England. They justified the con∣duct of the patentee, upon the report of Sir Isaac Newton and other officers of the mint, who had made the assay and trial of Wood's halfpence; and found he had complied with the terms of the patent. They declared, that this currency exceeded in goodness, fineness, and value of metal, all the copper mo∣ney which had been coined for Ireland, in the reigns of king Charles II. king James II. king William and queen Mary. The privy council likewise de∣monstrated, that his majesty's predecessors had always exercised the undoubted
<PB N="503" REF="5060"/>
prerogative of granting patents for copper coinage in Ireland to private persons: that none of these patents had been so beneficial to the kingdom as this granted to William Wood, who had not obtained it in an unprecedented manner; but after a reference to the attorney and sollicitor-general, and after Sir Isaac New∣ton had been consulted in every particular: finally, they proved, by a great number of witnesses, that there was a real want of such money in Ireland. Notwithstanding this decision, the ferment of the Irish nation was industriously kept up by clamour, pamphlets, papers, and lampoons, written by dean Swift, and other authors; so that Wood voluntarily reduced his coinage from the value of one hundred thousand to that of forty thousand pounds. Thus the noise was silenced. The commons of Ireland passed an act for accepting the affirmation of the quakers instead of an oath; and voted three hundred and forty thousand pounds towards discharging the debt of the nation, which amounted to about double that sum.</P>

<P>In the month of October England lost a worthy nobleman in the death of earl Cowper, who had twice discharged the office of lord chancellor, with equal discernment and integrity. He was profoundly skilled in the laws of his country; in his apprehension quick and penetrating; in his judg¦ment clear and determinate. He possessed a manly eloquence: his manner was agreeable, and deportment graceful. This year was likewise remarkable for the death of the duke of Orleans regent of France; who, since the decease of Lewis XIV. had ruled that nation with the most absolute authority. He was a prince of taste and spirit, endowed with shining talents for empire, which he did not fail to display, even in the midst of effeminate pursuits and idle de∣bauchery. From the infirm constitution of the infant king, he had conceived hopes of ascending the throne, and taken his measures accordingly; but the young monarch's health began to be established, and all the duke's schemes were defeated by an apoplexy, of which he died in the fiftieth year of his age, after having nominated the duke of Bourbon as prime minister. King George immediately received assurances of the good disposition of the French court, to cultivate and even improve the good understanding so happily established be∣tween France and Great-Britain. The king arrived in England on the eighteenth day of December; and on the ninth of January the parliament was assembled. His majesty, in his speech, recommended to the commons the care of the public debts; and he expressed his satisfaction at seeing the sinking fund improved and augmented, so as to put the debt of the nation into a method of being speedily and gradually discharged.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>This was the repeated theory of patriotism, which unhappily for the subjects was never reduced to practice: not, but that a beginning of such a laudable work was made in this very session, by an act for lessening the public debts, by which it was provided, that the annuities at five per cent. charged on the general fund by a former act, except such as had been subscribed into the South-sea, together with the unsubscribed blanks of the lottery, in the year one thousand seven hundred and fourteen, should be payed off at Lady-day of the year next ensuing, with the money arising from the sinking fund. The ministry, however, did not persevere in this path of prudent oeconomy. The commons granted all the supplies that were demanded. They voted ten thou∣sand seamen; and the majority, though not without violent opposition, agreed
<PB N="504" REF="5070"/>
to maintain four thousand additional troops which had been raised in the preceding year; so that the establishment of the land-forces amounted to eighteen thousand<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lit.

The expence of the year was defrayed by a land-tax and malt-tax. The commons having dispatched the supply, took into considera∣tion a grievance arising from protections granted by foreign ministers, peers, and members of parliament, under which profligate persons used to screen them∣selves from the prosecution of their just creditors. The commons resolved, That all protections granted by members of that house should be declared void, and immediately withdrawn. The lords made a declaration to the same purpose, with an exception of menial servants, and those necessarily employed about the<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>24.</NOTE> estates of peers <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The duke of Newcastle was now appointed secretary of state; the duke of Graston lord-cham∣berlain; and lord Carteret lord-lieutenant of Ireland.</P>

<P>In the beginning of this year Philip king of Spain, retiring with his queen to the monastery of St. Ildefonso, sent the marquis of Grimaldi, his prin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipal secretary of state, to his son the prince of Asturias, with a solemn renun∣ciation of the crown, and a letter of advice, in which he exhorted him to cul∣tivate the Blessed Virgin with the warmest devotion; and put himself and his kingdoms under her protection. The renunciation was published through the whole monarchy of Spain; and the council of Castile resolved, That Lewis might assume the reins of government without assembling the cortez. The English minister at Paris was instructed to interpose in behalf of the French protestants, against whom a severe edict had been lately published; but his re∣monstrances produced no effect. England, in the mean time, was quite barren of such events as deserve a place in history. The government was now firmly es∣tablished on the neck of opposition; and commerce flourished even under the load of grievous imposition.</P>

<P>The next parliament, which met on the twelfth day of November, seemed to be assembled for no other purpose than that of establishing funds for the expence of the ensuing year; tho' the session was distinguished by a remarkable incident; namely, the trial of the earl of Macclesfield lord-chancellor of England. This nobleman had connived at certain venal practices touching the sale of places, and the money of suitors deposited with the masters of chancery, so as to incur the general reproach of the nation. He found it necessary to resign the great-seal in the beginning of January. On the ninth day of the ensuing month the king sent a message to the commons, importing, that his majesty having reason to apprehend, that the suitors in the court of chancery were in danger of losing a considerable sum of money, from the insufficiency of some of the mas∣ters,
<PB N="505" REF="5080"/>
thought himself obliged in justice and compassion to the said sufferers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to take the most speedy and proper method the law would allow<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for inquiring into the state of the masters accounts, and securing their effects for the benefit of the suitors; and his majesty having had several reports layed before him, in pursuance of the directions he had given, had ordered the reports to be com∣municated to the house, that they may have as full and as perfect a view of this important affair as the shortness of the time, and the circumstances and nature of the proceedings would admit.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>These papers being taken into consideration, Sir George Oxenden observed, that enormous abuses had crept into the high court of chancery: that the crimes and misdemeanors of the late lord-chancellor were many and various, but might be reduced to the following heads: that he had embezzled the estates and effects of many widows, orphans, and lunatics: that he had raised the offices of masters in chancery to an exorbitant price; trusting in their hands large sums of money belonging to suitors, that they might be en∣abled to comply with his exorbitant demands: and, that in several cases he had made divers irregular orders. He therefore moved, That Thomas earl of Macclesfield should be impeached of high crimes and misdemeanor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Mr. Pulteney moved, That this affair might be left to the consideration of a select committee. Sir William Wyndham asserted, that in proceeding by way<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Mem. Hist. Deb. in Parl. Tindal.</NOTE> of impeachment upon reports from above, they would make a dangerous pre∣cedent; and seem to give up the most valuable of their privileges, the inquest after state-criminals. The question being put, it was carried for the impeach∣ment. The earl was accordingly impeached at the bar of the upper house: a committee was apppointed to prepare articles; and a bill was brought in to indemnify the masters in chancery from the penalties of the law, upon discover∣ing what considerations they had payed for their admission to their respective<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1725.</NOTE> offices. The trial lasted twenty days; the earl was convicted of fraudulent practices, and condemned in a fine of thirty thousand pounds, with impri∣sonment until that sum should be payed. He was immediately committed to the Tower, where he continued about six weeks; but, upon producing the money he was discharged; and Sir Peter King, created baron of Oakham, succeeded him in the office of chancellor.</P>

<P>His majesty, on the eighth day of April, gave the house of com∣mons to understand, that having been engaged in some extraordinary expences, he hoped he should be enabled to raise a sum of money, by making use of the funds lately established for the payment of the civil-list annuities, in order to discharge the debts contracted in his civil government. Mr. Pulteney, cofferer of the houshold, moved for an address, That an account should be layed before the house of all monies payed for secret-service, pensions, and bounties, from the twenty-fifth day of March in the year one thousand seven hundred and one, to the twenty-fifth of the same month in the present year. This address being voted, a motion was made to consider the king's message. Mr. Pulteney ur∣ged, that this consideration should be postponed until the house should have examined the papers that were the subject of the address. He expressed his surprize, that a debt amounting to above five hundred thousand pounds should be contracted in three years: he said, he did not wonder that some persons should be so eager to make good the deficiencies of the civil-list, since they
<PB N="506" REF="5090"/>
and their friends enjoyed such a share of that revenue; and, he desired to know, Whether this was all that was due, or, whether they should expect another reckoning? This gentleman began to be dissatisfied with the measures of the ministry; and his sarcasms were aimed at Mr. Walpole, who undertook to an∣swer his objections. The commons took the message into consideration, and passed a bill, enabling his majesty to raise any sum not exceeding one mil∣lion, by exchequer-bills, loans, or otherwise, on the credit of the deductions of sixpence per pound, directed by an act of parliament of the seventh year of his majesty, and of the civil-list revenues, at an interest not exceeding three pounds per cent. till repayment of the principal.</P>

<P>On the twentieth day of April a petition was presented to the house by the lord Finch, in behalf of Henry St. John, late viscount Boling∣broke, praying, that the execution of the law with respect to his forfeitures might be suspended, as a pardon had suspended it with respect to his life. Mr. Walpole signified to the house, by his majesty's command, that seven years before the petitioner had made his humble application and submission to the king, with assurances of duty, allegiance, and fidelity: that from his behaviour since that time, his majesty was convinced of his being a fit object of his mercy; and consented to his petitioning the house. The petition being read, Mr. Wal∣pole declared himself fully satisfied, that the petitioner had sufficiently atoned for his past offences; and therefore deserved the favour of that house, so far as to enable him to enjoy the family-inheritance that was settled upon him, which he could not do by virtue of his majesty's pardon, without an act of parlia∣ment. Lord Finch moved, That a bill might be brought in for this purpose; and was warmly opposed by Mr. Methuen, comptroller of the houshold, who represented Bolingbroke as a monster of iniquity. His remonstrance was supported by lord William Powlet and Mr. Onslow; nevertheless, the bill was prepared, passed through both houses, and received the royal assent. An act being passed for disarming the Highlanders of Scotland: another for regulating elections within the city of London: a third for reducing the interest of several bank annuities, together with some bills of a private nature; the parliament was prorogued in May, after the king had, in the warmest terms of acknow∣ledgment <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>On the fifth day of December the princess of Wales was delivered of a princess, christened by the name of Louisa, and afterwards married to the king of Denmark.

<P>The tide of political interests on the continent had begun to flow in a new channel, so as to render ineffectual the mounds which he had raised by his multiplicity of negotiations. Lewis, the Spanish monarch, dying soon after his elevation to the throne, his father Philip resumed the crown which he had designed; and gave himself up implicitly to the conduct of his queen, who was a princess of indefatigable intrigue and insatiate ambition. The infanta, who had been married to Lewis XV. of France, was so disagreeable to her
<PB N="507" REF="5100"/>
husband, that the whole French nation began to be apprehensive of a civil war, in consequence of his dying without male issue: he therefore determined, with the advice of his council, to send back the infanta, as the nuptials had not been consummated; and she was attended to Madrid by the marquis de Monteleone. The queen of Spain resented this insult offered to her daughter; and, in revenge, dismissed mademoiselle de Beaujolois, one of the regent's daughters, who had been betrothed to her son Don Carlos. As the congress at Cambray had proved ineffectual, she offered to adjust her differences with the emperor under the sole mediation of Great-Britain. This was an honour which king George declined. He was averse to any undertaking that might interrupt the harmony subsisting between him and the court of Versailles; and he had taken umbrage at the emperor's refusing to grant the investiture of Bremen and Verden, except upon terms which he did not choose to embrace. The peace between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, which he refused to mediate, was effected by a private negotiation, under the management of the duke de Rip∣perda, a native of the states-general, who had renounced the protestant religion, and entered into the service of his catholic majesty. By two treaties, signed at Vienna in the month of April, the emperor acknowledged Philip as king of Spain and the Indies, promising, that he would not molest him in the posses∣sion of those dominions that were secured to him by the treaty of Utrecht. Philip renounced all pretensions to the dominions in Italy and the Netherlands, adjudged to the emperor by the treaty of London: Charles granted the investi∣ture of the dukedoms of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, to the eldest son of the queen of Spain, in default of heirs in the present possessors, as masculine fiefs of the empire. Spain became guaranty of the Austrian succession, according to the pragmatic sanction, by which the dominions of that house were settled on the emperor's heirs general, and declare to be a perpetual, indivisible, and inseparable feoffment to the primogeniture. By the commercial treaty of Vienna, the Austrian subjects were intitled to advantages in trade with Spain, which no other nation enjoyed. His catholic majesty guarantied the Ostend East-India company; and agreed to pay an annual subsidy of four millions of piasters to the emperor. Great sums were remitted to Vienna: the Imperial forces were augmented to a formidable number; and other powers were sollicited to engage in this alliance, to which the court of Petersburgh actually acceded.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The king of Great-Britain took the alarm. The emperor and he had for some time treated each other with manifest coldness. He had reason to fear some attempt upon his German dominions; and projected a defensive treaty with France and Prussia. This alliance, limited to the term of fifteen years, was negotiated and concluded at Hanover, in the month of September. It im∣plied a mutual guaranty of the dominions possessed by the contracting parties, their rights and privileges, those of commerce in particular, and an engage∣ment to procure satisfaction to the protestants of Thorn, who had lately been oppressed by the catholics, contrary to the treaty of Oliva. The king having taken these precautions at Hanover, set out on his return for England, embarked at Helvoetsluys in the middle of December; and after having been exposed to the fury of a dreadful storm, was landed with great difficulty at Rye, from whence he proceeded by land to London. The parliament meeting on the twentieth day of the next month, he gave them to understand, that the dis∣tressed
<PB N="508" REF="5110"/>
condition of some of their protestant brethren abroad, and the negotiations and engagements contracted by some foreign powers, which seemed to have layed the foundation of new troubles and disturbances in Europe, and to threaten his subjects with the loss of several of the most advantageous branches of their trade, had obliged him to concert with other powers, such measures as might give a check to the ambitious views of those who were endeavouring to render them∣selves formidable; and put a stop to the further progress of such dangerous de∣signs. He told them, that the enemies of his government were already very busy, by their instruments and emissaries in those courts, whose measures seemed most to favour their purposes, in solliciting and promoting the cause of the pretender. One sees, at first sight, that the interests of Germany dictated the treaty of Hanover; but, in order to secure the approbation of Great-Britain, upon which the support of this alliance chiefly depended, it was judged neces∣sary to insert the articles relating to commerce and the protestant religion, as if the engagement had been contracted purely for the advantage and glory of Eng∣land. In a word, the ministry began now to ring the changes upon a few words that have been repeated ever since, like cabalistical sounds, by which the nation has been enchanted into a very dangerous connexion with the concerns of the continent. They harangued, they insisted upon the machinations of the disaf∣fected, the designs of a popish pretender, the protestant interest, and the ballance of power, until these expressions became absolutely terms of ridicule, with every person of common sense and reflection. The people were told, that the em∣peror and king of Spain, exclusive of the public treaties concluded at Vienna, had entered into private engagements, importing, that the Imperialists should join the Spaniards in recovering Gibraltar and Portmahon by force of arms, in case the king of England should refuse to restore them amicably, according to a solemn promise he had made: that a double marriage should take place between the two infants of Spain, and the two archdutchesses of Austria: and, that means should be taken to place the pretender on the throne of Great-Britain.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="26" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>When the treaties of Vienna and Hanover fell under consideration of the house of commons, Horatio Walpole, afterwards termed <Q>“the ballance-master,”</Q> inderision, opened the debate with a long unanimated oration, giving a detail of the affairs of Europe since the treaty of Utrecht. He enumerated the barrier-treaty, the convention for executing that treaty, the defensive alliance with the emperor, the other with the most christian king and the states-general, another convention, the quadruple alliance, the congress at Cambray, the treaty of Hanover, and that of Vienna. He explained the nature of each engagement. He said, the main design of the treaty of commerce concluded between the em∣peror and Spain, was to countenance and support the East-India company esta∣blished at Oftend, which interfered so essentially with the East-India companies of England and Holland, and was directly contrary to several solemn treaties still in force. He enlarged upon the danger to which the ballance of power would be exposed, should the issue-male of this projected marriage between the houses of Austria and Spain, ever possess the Imperial dignity and the kingdom of Spain together. The reader will take notice, that this very man was one of those who exclaimed against that article of the treaty at Utrecht, which pre∣vented the power of those two houses from being immediately united in the person of the emperor. He did not forget to expatiate upon the pretended secret
<PB N="509" REF="5120" MS="y"/>
engagement concerning Gibraltar and Minorca; and the king's pious concern for the distressed protestants of Thorn in Poland. In vain did Mr. Shippen urge, that the treaty of Hanover would engage the British nation in a war for the def nce of the king's German dominions, contrary to an express provision made in the act of limitation. These arguments had lost all weight. The op∣position was so inconsiderable, that the ministry had no reason to be in pain about any measure they should propose. An address was voted and delivered to his majesty, approving the alliance he had concluded at Hanover, in order to obvi∣ate and disappoint the dangerous views and consequences of the treaty of peace betwixt the emperor and the king of Spain; and promising to support his ma∣jesty against all insults and attacks that should be made upon any of his terri∣tories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain. An address of the same kind was presented by the house of lords in a body. A bill was brought in, impowering the commissioners of the treasury to compound with Mr. Rich∣ard Hampden late treasurer of the navy, for a debt he owed to the crown, amounting to eight and forty thousand pounds. This deficiency was occasioned by his embarking in the South-sea scheme. The king recommended his pe∣tition; and the house complied with his request, in consideration of his great-grandfather the famous John Hampden, who made such a noble stand against the arbitrary measures of the first Charles.</P>

<P>The malt-tax was found so grievous to Scotland, that the peo∣ple refused to pay it, and riots were excited in different parts of the kingdom. At Glasgow, the populace, armed with clubs and staves, rifled the house of Daniel Campbell their representative in parliament, who had voted for the bill; and maltreated some excisemen who attempted to take an account of the malt. General Wade, who commanded the forces in Scotland, had sent two compa∣nies of soldiers under the command of captain Bushel, to prevent or appease any disturbance of this nature. He drew up his men in the street, where they were pelted with stones by the multitude, which he endeavoured to disperse by firing among them without shot. This expedient failing, he ordered his men to load their pieces with ball, and at a time when the magistrates were advancing towards him in a body, to assist him with their advice and influence, he com∣manded the soldiers to fire four different ways, without the sanction of the civil authority. Above twenty persons were killed or wounded on this occasion. The people seeing so many victims fall, were exasperated beyond all sense of danger. They began to procure arms, and breathed nothing but defiance and revenge. Bushel thought proper to retreat to the castle of Dumbarton; and was pursued above five miles by the enraged multitude. General Wade being informed of this transaction, assembled a body of forces; and being accompa∣nied by Duncan Forbes lord advocate, took possession of Glasgow. The ma∣gistrates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oldmixon. Annals. Deb. in Parl. Mem. Hist. Tindal.</NOTE> were apprehended and conveyed prisoners to Edinburgh, where the lords-justiciary having taken cognizance of the affair, declared them innocent; so that they were immediately discharged. Bushel was tried for murder, con∣victed and condemned; but, instead of undergoing the penalties of the law, he was indulged with a pardon, and promoted in the service. Daniel Campbell having petitioned the house of commons, that he might be indemnified for the damage he had sustained from the rioters, a bill passed in his favour, grant∣ing him a certain sum to be raised from an imposition layed upon all the beer and

ale brewed within the city of Glasgow. The malt-tax was so sensibly felt in Scotland, that the convention of the royal burroughs presented a remonstrance against it, as a grievous burthen which their country could not bear: petitions to the same purport were delivered to the commons from different shires of that<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

On the twenty-fourth day of March the king sent a message to the house by Sir Paul Methuen, desiring an extraordinary supply, that he might be able to augment his maritime force, and concert such other measures as should be necessary in the present conjuncture. A debate ensued; but the ma∣jority complied with the demand. Some members in the upper house com∣plained, that the message was not sent to both houses of parliament; and this suggestion gave rise to another debate, in which lord Bathurst and others made some melancholy reflections upon the state of insignificance to which the peers of England were reduced. Such remarks, however, were very little minded by the ministry, which had obtained a complete victory over all opposition. The sup∣plies ordinary and extraordinary being granted, with every thing else which the court thought proper to ask; and several bills passed for the regulation of civil oeconomy, the king dismissed the parliament on the twenty-fourth day of May.</P>

<P>By this time Peter the czar of Muscovy was dead, and his em∣press Catherine had succeeded him on the Russian throne. This princess had begun to assemble forces in the neighbourhood of Petersburgh; and prepare a formidable armament for a naval expedition. King George concluding, that her design was against Sweden, sent a strong squadron into the Baltic, under the command of Sir Charles Wager, in order to anticipate her views upon his allies. The English fleet being joined at Copenhagen by a Danish squadron, alarmed the court of Russia, which immediately issued orders for reinforcing the garri∣sons of Wibourg, Cronslot, Revel, and Riga. The English admiral having had an audence of his Swedish majesty, steered towards Revel, and sent thither a lieutenant with a letter from the king of Great-Britain to the czarina. This was an expostulation, in which he observed, that he and his allies could not fail of being alarmed at her great preparations by sea and land. He complained, that measures had been taken at her court in favour of the pretender: that his repeated instances for establishing a lasting friendship with the crown of Russia, had been treated with neglect; and he gave her to understand, that he had or∣dered his admiral to prevent her ships from coming out of her harbours, should she persi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in her resolution to execute the designs she had projected. The cza∣rina, in her answer to the king, expressed her surprize, that she had not received his majesty's letter until his fleet was at anchor before Revel, since it would have been more agreeable to the custom established among sovereigns, and to the amity which had so long subsisted between her kingdoms and the crown of Great-Britain, to expostulate with her on her armament, and expect her answer
<PB N="511" REF="5140"/>
before he had proceeded to such an offensive measure. She assured him, that nothing was farther from her thoughts than any designs to disturb the peace of the North; and with regard to the pretender, it was a frivolous and stale accu∣sation, which had been frequently used as a pretext to cover all the unkind steps lately taken against the Russian empire. Sir Charles Wager continued in his station until he received certain intelligence, that the Russian gallies were layed up in their winter harbour: then he set sail for the coast of Denmark, from whence he returned to England in the month of November.</P>

<P>King George, that he might not seem to convert all his attention to the affairs of the North, had equipped two other <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quadrons; one of which was destined for the West-Indies, under the command of admiral Hosier. The other, conducted by Sir John Jennings, having on board a body of land-forces, sailed from St. Helen's on the twentieth day of July, entered the bay of St. Antonio; then visited Lisbon, from whence he directed his course to the bay of Bulls near Cadiz, and cruised off Cape St. Mary's, so as to alarm the coast of Spain, and fill Madrid with consternation. Yet he committed no act of hostility; but was treated with great civility by the Spanish governor of Cadiz, who supplied him with refreshments. Rear-admiral Hosier, with seven ships of war, had sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed in April for the Spanish West-Indies, with instructions to block up the galleons in the ports of that country; or, should they presume to come out, seize and bring them to England. Before his arrival at the Basti∣mentos near Porto Bello, the treasure, consisting of above six millions sterling, had been unloaded and carried back to Panama, in pursuance of an order sent by an advice-boat, which had the start of Hosier. This admiral lay inactive on that statio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> until he became the jest of the Spaniards. He returned to Ja∣maica, where he found means to reinforce his crews: then he stood over to Carthagene. The Spaniards had by this time seized the English South-sea ship at La Vera-Cruz, together with all the vessels and effects belonging to that company. Hosier in vain demanded restitution: he took some Spanish ships by way of reprisal, and continued cruizing in those seas until the greater part of his men perished deplorably by the diseases of that unhealthy climate; and his ships were totally ruined by the worms. This brave officer being restricted by his orders from obeying the dictates of his courage; seeing his best offcers and men daily swept off by an outrageous distemper, and his ships exposed to inevitable destruction, is said to have died of a broken heart; while the people of England loudly clamoured against this unfortunate expedition, in which so many lives were thrown away, and so much money expended without the least advantage to the nation. It seems to have been a mean p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>atical scheme to rob the court of Spain of its expected treasure, even while a peace subsisted between the two nations. The ministry of Great-Britain indeed alledged, that the Spanish king had entered into engagements in favour of the pretender.</P>

<P>The dukes of Ormond and Wharton, and the earl Marischal, were certainly at Madrid; and the duke de Ripperda, now prime minister of Spain, dropped some expressions to the English envoy, that implied some such design, which, however, the court of Madrid positively denied. Ripperda, as a fo∣reigner, fell a sacrifice to the jealousy of the Spanish ministers.

ambassador, who was unwilling to be troubled with such a guest. He there∣fore conveyed him in his coach to the house of colonel Stanhope the British minister, whose protection he craved and obtained Nevertheless, he was drag∣ged from thence by force, and committed prisoner to the castle of Segovia. He afterwards made his escape, and sheltered himself in England, from the re∣sentment of his catholic majesty. Colonel Stanhope complained of this viola∣tion of the law of nations, which the Spanish ministers endeavoured to excuse. Memorials and letters passed between the two courts, and every thing tended to a rupture. The king of Spain purchased ships of war; began to make preparations for some important undertaking; and assembled an army of twenty thousand men at St. Roch, on pretence of rebuilding the old castle of Gib∣raltar. Mean while the states-general and the king of Sweden acceded to the treaty of Hanover: but the king of Prussia, though his majesty's son-in-law, was detached from the alliance by the emperor, with whom he contracted new engagements.</P>

<P>On the seventeenth day of January, the British parliament was opened with a long elaborate speech, importing, That the proceedings and transactions of the emperor and king of Spain, and the secret offensive alliances concluded between them, had layed the foundations of a most exorbitant and formidable power: that they were directly levelled against the most valuable and darling interests and privileges of the English nation, which must either give up Gibraltar to Spain, and acquiesce in the emperor's usurped exercise of commerce, or resolve vigorously to defend their undoubted rights against those reciprocal engagements contracted in defiance and violation of all national faith, and the most solemn treaties. He assured them, that one of those secret ar∣ticles was, the placing the pretender on the throne of Great-Britain; and an∣other, the conquest of Gibraltar and Portmahon. He affirmed, that those combinations extended themselves into Russia; and that the English fleet sea∣sonably prevented such designs as would have opened a way to the invasion of these kingdoms. He exhorted the commons to grant such supplies as should be necessary for the defence of their country, and for making good his en∣gagements with the allies of Great-Britain. He told them, that the king of Spain had ordered his minister residing in England to quit the kingdom; and that he had left a memorial, little short of a declaration, in which he insisted upon the restitution of Gibraltar. He did not fail to touch the energic strings which always moved their passions; the balance of power in Europe, the se∣curity of the British commerce, the designs of a popish pretender, the present happy establishment, the religion, liberties, and properties of a protestant people. Such addresses of t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anks were penned in both houses as the ministers were pleased to dictate; yet not without opposition from a minority, which was far from being formidable, though headed by chiefs of uncommon talents and resolution. The com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ons voted twenty thousand seamen, and six and twenty thousand three hundred eighty-three men for the land-service; and to defray the extraordinary expence, a laid-tax of four shillings in the pound was granted.</P>

<P>The house of lords having taken into consideration the letters and memorials between the ministers of Great-Britain, France, and Spain, and the papers relating to the accession of the states-general to the treaty of Hanover; a warm debate ensued. The lord Bathurst took notice, that the
<PB N="513" REF="5160"/>
accession of the states-general to the treaty, was upon condition, that this their act should be approved and ratified by the king of Great-Britain, the most christian king, and the king of Prussia; but that the minister of his Prussian majesty had refused to sign the act of accession, which was therefore of no effect: that if the court of France should, for the same reason, think itself disengaged from the Hanover alliance, Britain alone would be obliged to bear the burthen of an expensive war against two of the greatest potentates of Eu∣rope. He said he could not see any just reason for a rupture with Spain: that indeed the duke de Ripperda might have dropped some indiscreet expressions: he was known to be a man of a violent temper; and he had been solemnly dis∣avowed by his catholic majesty: that, in the memorial left by the Spanish am∣bassador, he imputed the violent state of affairs between the two crowns to the ministers of England; and mentioned a positive promise made by the king of Great-Britain for the restitution of Gibraltar: that methods of ac∣commodation might be tried before the kingdom engaged in a war which must be attended with dangerous consequences: that the nation was loaded with a debt of fifty millions; and, in order to maintain such a war, would be obliged to raise seven millions yearly; an annual sum by which the people would soon be exhausted. He observed, that in some papers layed before the house, mention was made of great sums distributed in divers places, to bring certain measures to bear. He declared, that for his own part, he had touched neither Spanish nor English gold; he was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman, but a true Englishman, and so long as he had the honour to sit in that house, he would speak and act for the good of his country. He therefore desired their lordships seriously to consider the matter before them, which was of the last consequence and importance to the whole nation. He said, nothing could be gained by the war should it prove successful; and every thing would be lost should it be unprosperous. He was answerd by lord Townshend, who affirmed, that his majesty had received positive and certain information with respect to the secret article of alliance between the courts of Vienna and Madrid, in fa∣vour of the pretender, though the safety of the state did not permit him to lay these advices before the parliament. After much altercation, the majority re∣solved, that the measures his majesty had thought fit to take, were honourable, just, and necessary, for preventing the execution of the dangerous engagements entered into in favour of the pretender; for preserving the dominions belonging to the crown of Great-Britain by solemn treaties, and particularly those of Gibraltar and the island of Minorca; and for maintaining to his people their most valuable rights and privileges of commerce, and the peace and tran∣quillity of Europe. Seventeen lords entered a protest against this resolution. Disputes of the same nature arose from the same subject in the lower house. Lord Townshend had affirmed in the house of peers, that no promise of re∣storing Gibraltar had been made: Sir Robert Walpole owned such a promise in the house of commons: a motion was made for an address, desiring these engagements might be layed before the house: another member moved for a copy of the memorial presented by Mr. Pointz to the king of Sweden, and for the secret offensive article between the courts of Vienna and Madrid: a third motion was made to address the king for such memorials and representa∣tions from the courts of Sweden and Denmark, as induced him, in the course
<PB N="514" REF="5170"/>
of the preceding year, to send a squadron to the Baltic. In the account of the money granted for the service of the last year, there was an article of one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds charged in general terms, as issued out for other engagements and expences, over and above such as were speci∣fied. Mr. Pulteney moved for an address on this subject; but each of these motions was rejected on a division; and the majority concurred in an address of thanks to his majesty, for the great wisdom of his conduct. They expressed the most implicit confidence in his goodness and discretion: they promised to support him in all such further measures as he should find necessary and ex∣pedient for preventing a rupture; and for the honour and advantage of these kingdoms.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>His majesty's speech gave such umbrage to the court of Vienna, that Mr. Palms, the Imperial resident at London, was ordered to present a warm memorial to the king, and afterwards to publish it to the whole nation. In this bold remonstrance, the king was charged with having declared from the throne, as certain and undoubted facts, several things that were either wrested, misrepresented, or void of all foundation. The memorailist affirmed, that the treaty of Vienna was built on the quadruple alliance: that the treaty of commerce was calculated to promote the mutual and lawful advantages of the subjects of both parties, agreeably to the law of nations; and in no respect prejudicial to the British nation. He declared, that there was no offensive al∣liance concluded between the two crowns: that the supposed article relating to the pretender, was an absolute falshood: that the insinuation with respect to the siege of Gibraltar was equally untrue, his master having made no engage∣ments with the king of Spain but such as were specified in the treaty com∣municated to his Britannic majesty. He said, the hostilities notoriously com∣mitted in the West-Indies, and elsewhere, against the king of Spain, in vio∣lation of treaties, seemed to justify that prince's undertaking the siege of Gib∣raltar. Finally, he demanded, in the name of his Imperial majesty, suitable reparation for the injury his honour had sustained from such calumnious im∣putations. Both houses of parliament expressed their indignation at the inso∣lence of this memorial, in an address to his majesty; and Mr. Palms was or∣dered to depart the kingdom. Virulent declarations were presented by the mi∣nisters of the emperor and king of Great-Britain, to the diet of the empire at Ratisbon; and such personal reflections retorted between these two potentates, that all hope of reconciliation vanished.</P>

<P>King George, in order to secure himself against the impending storm, entered into more strict engagements with the French king; and agreed to pay fifty thousand pounds for three years to the king of Sweden, in con∣sideration of that prince's holding in readiness a body of ten thousand troops for the occasions of the alliance. He concluded a fresh treaty with the king of Denmark, who promised to furnish a certain number of auxiliaries, on account of a large subsidy granted by the king of France. The proportions of troops to be sent into the field, in case of a rupture, were ascertained. His Britannic majesty engaged for four and twenty thousand men, and a strong squadron to be sent into the Baltic. He made a convention with the prince of Hesse-Cassel, who undertook to provide eight thousand infantry and four thousand horse, in consideration of seventy-four thousand pounds to be payed
<PB N="515" REF="5180"/>
by Great-Britain immediately, and fifty thousand pounds more in case the troops should be required, besides their pay and subsistence. Such was the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Annals. Deb. in Parl. Tindal. Lives of the Admirals.</NOTE> fruit of all the alliances so industriously planted since the accession of king George to the throne of Great Britain. In the day of his trouble, the king of Prussia, who had espoused his daughter, deserted his interest; and the states-general stood aloof. For the security of his German dominions, he had re∣course to the king of France, who was a precarious ally; to the kings of Sweden and Denmark, and the principality of Hesse-Cassel: but none of these powers would contribute their assistance, without being gratified with exorbi∣tant subsidies, though the danger was common, and the efforts ought to have been equal. Instead of allies, they professed themselves mercenaries. Great-Britain payed them for the defence of their own dominions: she moreover un∣dertook to maintain a powerful fleet for their safety. Is there any Briton so weak as to think, or so fool-hardy as to affirm, that this was a British quarrel?</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1727.</NOTE> For the support of those expensive treaties, Mr. Scroope, se∣cretary of the treasury, moved in the house of commons, that, in the malt∣tax bill, they should insert a clause of appropriation, impowering the king to apply such sums as should be necessary for defraying the expences and engage∣ments which had been or should be made before the twenty-fifth day of Sep∣tember, in concerting such measures as he should think most conducive to the security of trade, and restoring the peace of Europe. To little purpose did the members in the opposition urge, that this method of asking and granting supplies was unparliamentary: that such a clause would render ineffectual that appropriation of the public money, which the wisdom of all parliaments had thought a necessary security against misapplication, which was the more to be feared, as no provision was made to call any person to account for the money that should be disposed of by virtue of this clause: that great sums had al∣ready been granted: that such an unlimited power ought never to be given in a free government: that such confidence in the crown might, through the induence of evil ministers, be attended with the most dangerous consequences: that the constitution could not be preserved, but by a strict adherence to those essential parliamentary forms of granting supplies upon estimates, and of ap∣propriating these supplies to services and occasions publicly avowed and judged necessary: that such clauses, if not seasonably checked, would become so fre∣quent, as in time to lodge in the crown and in the ministers an absolute and uncontroulable power of raising money upon the people, which by the con∣stitution is, and with safety can only be, lodged in the whole legislature. The motion was carried, the clause added, and the bill passed through the other house without amendment, though not without opposition. Notwithstanding this vote of credit, Sir William Yonge moved, that towards the supply granted to the king, the sum of three hundred and seventy thousand pounds should be raised by loans on exchequer-bills, to be charged on the surplus of the duties on coal and culm, which was reserved for the parliament's disposal. Though this motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Joseph Jekyl and Mr. Pulteney, as a dangerous deviation from several votes and acts of parliament, by which the exceedings of the public funds were appropriated to the discharge of the na∣tional debt, or to the increase of the sinking-fund, it was carried by the ma∣jority.</P>

<P>On the fifteeenth day of May the parliament was prorogued, after the king had acknowledged their zeal, liberality, and dispatch; and given them to understand, that the siege of Gibraltar was actually begun.

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>AT the accession of George II. the nation had great reason to wish for an alteration of measures. The public debt, notwithstanding the boasted oeconomy and management of the ministers; notwithstanding the sink∣ing fund, which had been extolled as a growing treasure sacred to the discharge of national ineumbrances, was now encreased to fifty millions two hundred sixty-one thousand two hundred and six pounds, nineteen shillings, eight pence three farthings. The kingdom was bewildered in a labyrinth of treaties and conventions, by which it stood engaged in pecuniary subsidies to many powers upon the continent, with whom its real interests could never be connected. The wealth of the nation had been lavished upon these foreign connexions; upon unnecessary wars and fruitless expeditions. Dangerous incroachment had been made upon the constitution by the repeal of the act for triennial par∣liaments; by frequent suspensions of the Habeas corpus act upon frivolous oc∣casions; by repealing clauses in the act of settlement; by votes of credit; by habituating the people to a standing army; and above all, by establishing a system of corruption, which at all times would secure a majority in parliament. The nature of prerogative, by which the liberties of the nation had formerly
<PB N="519" REF="5220"/>
been so often endangered, was now so well understood, and so securely restrained, that it could no longer be used for the same oppressive purposes: besides, an avowed extension of the prerogative required more ability, courage, and reso∣lution, than the present ministry could exert. They understood their own strength, and had recourse to a more safe and effectual expedient. The vice, luxury, and prostitution of the age, the almost total extinction of sentiment, ho∣nour, and public spirit, had prepared the minds of men for slavery and corrup∣tion. The means were in the hands of the ministry: the public treasure was at their devotion: they multiplied places and pensions to increase the number of their dependents: they squandered away the money of the nation without taste, discernment, decency, or remorse: they enlisted an army of the most abandoned emissaries, whom they employed to vindicate the worst measures, in the face of truth, common sense, and common honesty; and they did not fall to stigmatize as Jacobites and enemies to the government, all those who presumed to question the merit of their administration.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ II.</HEAD>
<P>The supreme direction of affairs was not yet engrossed by a single minister. Lord Townshend had the reputation of conducting the external transactions relating to treaties and negotiations. He is said to have un∣derstood that province, though he did not always follow the dictates of his own understanding. He possessed an extensive fund of knowledge; and was well acquainted with the functions of his office. The duke of N. his colleague, was not remarkable for any of these qualifications; he owed his promotion to his uncommon zeal for the illustrious house of Hano∣ver, and to the strength of his interest in parliament, rather than to his judgment, precision, or any other intellectual merit. Lord C. who may be counted an auxiliary, though not immediately concerned in the administration, had distinguished himself in the character of envoy at several courts in Eu∣rope. He had attained an intimate knowledge of all the different interests and connexions subsisting among the powers of the continent; and he infinitely surpassed all the ministers in learning and capacity. He was, indeed, the only man of genius employed under this government. He spoke with ease and propriety; his conceptions were just and lively; his inferences bold; his counsels vigorous and warm. Yet he depriciated his talents by acting in a subordinate character to those whom he despised; and seemed to look upon the pernicious measures of a bad ministry with silent contempt, rather than with avowed detestation. The interior government of Great-Britain was chiefly ma∣naged by Sir Robert W. a man of extraordinary talents, who had from low begin∣nings raised himself to the head of the treasury. Having obtained a seat in the lower house, he declared himself one of the most forward partisans of the Whig faction. He was endued with a species of eloquence, which though neither ner∣vous nor elegant, flowed with great facility, and was so plausible on all subjects, that even when he misrepresented the truth, whether from ignorance of design, he seldom failed to persuade that part of his audience for whose hearing his ha∣rangue was chiefly intended. He was well acquainted with the nature of the public funds, and understood the whole mystery of stock-jobbing. This know∣ledge produced a connexion between him and the money-corporations, which served to enhance his importance. He perceived the bulk of mankind were actuated by a sordid thirst of lucre; had sagacity enough to convert the degene∣racy
<PB N="520" REF="5230"/>
of the times to his own advantage; and on this, and this alone, he founded the whole superstructure of his subsequent administration. In the late reign he had, by dint of speaking decisively to every question, by boldly impeaching the conduct of the Tory ministers, by his activity in elections, and engaging as a projector in the schemes of the monied-interest, become a leading member in the house of commons. By his sufferings under the Tory parliament, he attained the rank of a martyr to his party: his interest, his reputation, and his presump∣tion daily increased: he opposed Sunderland as his rival in power, and headed a dangerous defection from the ministry, which evinced the greatness of his influence and authority. He had the glory of being principally concerned in effecting a reconciliation between the late king and the prince of Wales: then he was reassociated in the administration with additional credit; and, from the death of the earls of Sunderland and Stanhope, he had been making long strides towards the office of prime-minister. He knew the maxims he had adopted would subject him to the hatred, the ridicule, and reproach of some individu∣als, who had not yet resigned all sentiments of patriotism, nor all views of op∣position: but the number of these was inconsiderable when compared to that which constituted the body of the community; and he would not suffer the consideration of such antagonists to come in competition with his schemes of power, affluence, and authority. Nevertheless, low as he had humbled an∣tiministerial association, it required all his artifice to elude, all his patience and natural phlegm, to bear the powerful arguments that were urged, and the keen satire that was exercised against his measures and management, by a few members in the opposition. Sir William Wyndham possessed all the energy of elocution; Mr Shippen was calm, intrepid, shrewd, and sarcastic; Mr. Hungerford sly, insinuating, and ironical. Mr. W. P. inherited from nature a good un∣derstanding, which he had studiously cultivated. He was one of the most learned members in the house of commons, extremely well qualified to judge of literary productions; well read in history and politics; deeply skilled in the British constitution, the detail of government, and the nature of the finances. He spoke with freedom, fluency, and uncommon warmth of declamation, which was said to be the effect of personal animosity to Sir R. W. with whom he had been formerly connected.</P>

<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>An express arriving on the fourteenth day of June with an account of the late king's death, his present majesty king George II. repaired from Rich∣mond, where he received this intelligence, to Leicester-house; and the mem∣bers of the privy-council being assembled, were sworn a-new. The king de∣clared his firm purpose to preserve the constitution in church and state, and to cultivate those alliances which his father had made with foreign princes. At the same time he took and subscribed the oath for the security of the church of Scotland, as required by the act of union. Next day he was proclaimed king of Great-Britain. The parliament assembled in pursuance of the act made for that purpose; but was immediately prorogued by commission to the twenty-seventh day of the month. All the great officers of state continued in their places: Sir Robert Walpole kept possession of the treasury; and the system of politics which the late king established underwent no sort of alteration. The king, in his speech to both houses at the opening of the session, professed a fixed resolu∣tion to merit the love and affection of his people, by maintaining them in the
<PB N="521" REF="5240"/>
full enjoyment of their religious and civil rights. He promised to lessen the public expence as soon as the circumstances of affairs would permit: he ob∣served to the commons, that the grant of the greatest part of the civil list re∣venues was now determined; and, that it would be necessary for them to make a new provision for the support of him and his family: and he recommended it to both houses to dispatch the business that should be necessarily brought before them, as the season of the year and the circumstances of time required their pre∣sence in the country. Addresses of condolance and congratulation being drawn up and presented, the commons, in a committee of the whole house, took into consideration a motion for a supply to his majesty. Sir Robert Walpole hav∣ing observed, that the annual sum of seven hundred thousand pounds granted to and settled on the late king, had fallen short every year; and, that his present majesty's expences were likely to increase by reason of the largeness of his family, moved, that the intire revenues of the civil list, which produced about eight hundred thousand pounds per annum, should be settled on the king during his life. Mr. Shippen opposed this motion, as inconsistent with the trust reposed in them as representatives of the people, who ought to be very frugal in exercising the right of giving away the public money. He said, the sum of seven hun∣dred thousand pounds was not obtained for his late majesty without a long and solemn debate; and every member who contended for it at that time, allowed it to be an ample royal revenue: that, although his majesty's family should be enlarged, a circumstance which had been urged as one reason for the mo∣tion, he presumed the appointments of prince Frederick would be much in∣ferior to those settled on his present majesty when he was prince of Wales; be∣sides, it was to be hoped, that many personal, many particular expences in the late reign, especially those for frequent journies to Hanover, would be discon∣tinued, and intirely cease. He observed, that the civil list branches in the qneen's reign did not often exceed the sum of five hundred and fifty thousand pounds; nevertheless, she called upon her parliament but once in a reign of thirteen years, to pay the debts contracted in her civil government; and, these were occasioned by the unparalelled instances of her piety and generosity. She gave the first-fruits and tenths, arising to nineteen thousand pounds a-year, as an augmentation of the maintenance of the poor clergy. She bestowed five thou∣sand pounds per annum, out of the post-office, on the duke of Marlborough: she suffered seven hundred pounds to be charged weekly on the same office, for the service of the public: she expended several hundred thousand pounds in building the castle of Blenheim: she allowed four thousand pounds annually to prince Charles of Denmark: she sustained great losses by the tin-contract: she supported the poor Palatines: she exhibited many other proofs of royal bounty, and, immediately before her death, she had formed a plan of retrenchment; which would have reduced her yearly expences to four hundred and fifty-nine thousand nine hundred and forty-one pounds. He affirmed, that a million a-year would not be sufficient to carry on the exorbitant expences, so often and so justly complained of in the house of commons: that over and above the yearly allowance of seven hundred thousand pounds, many occasional taxes, many ex∣cessive sums were raised, and all sunk in the bottomless gulph of secret service. Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds were raised in defiance of the antient parlia∣mentary methods, to secure the kingdom from a Swedish invasion: then the
<PB N="522" REF="5250"/>
two insurance offices were erected, and payed near three hundred thousand pounds for their charters: our enmity with Sweden being changed into alliance, a sub∣sidy of seventy-two thousand pounds was implicitly granted, to fulfil some secret engagement with that crown: four and twenty thousand pounds were given for burning merchant ships arrived from infected places, though the goods, which ought to have been destroyed for the public safety, were afterwards privately sold: a sum of five hundred thousand pounds was demanded and granted, for paying the debts of the civil list; and his majesty declared, by message, he was resolved to retrench his expences for the future. Notwithstanding this resolu∣tion, in less than four years, a new demand of the like sum was made and granted, to discharge new incumbrances: the Spanish ships of war which ad∣miral Byng took in the Mediterranean, were sold for a considerable sum of money: one hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds were granted in the last session, to be secretly disposed of for the public utility; and there was still a debt in the civil government, amounting to above six hundred thousand pounds. He took notice, that this amazing extravagance happened under the conduct of persons pretending to surpass all their predecessors in the knowledge and care of the public revenue: that as none of these sums had been accounted for, they were, in all probability, employed in services not fit to be owned. He said, he heartily wished that time, the great discoverer of hidden truths, and concealed iniquities, might produce a list of all such as had been perverted from their public duty by private pensions; who had been the hired slaves, and the cor∣rupt instruments of a profuse and vain-glorious administration. He proposed, that instead of granting an addition to the civil list, they should restrict that re∣venue to a certain sum, by concluding the question with these words, <Q>“in like manner as they were granted and continued to his late majesty, so as to make up the clear yearly sum of seven hundred thousand pounds.”</Q> To these par∣ticulars, which were indeed unanswerable, no reply was made. Even this mark of decency was layed aside as idle and superfluous. The house agreed to the motion; and a bill was brought in for the better support of his majesty's houshold. The commons having received a message from the king, desiring they would make further provision for the queen his consort, resolved, That in case she should survive his majesty, the sum of one hundred thousand pounds should be settled upon her for life, charged upon the revenues of the civil list, together with his majesty's palace of Somerset-house, and Richmond Old Park. A bill was formed on this resolution, which, as well as the other, passed both houses; and received the royal assent on the seventeenth day of July, when the king, in a speech to both houses, expressed his satisfaction with their conduct; and congratulated them upon the wealth and glory of the nation, by which they had acquired such weight in holding the ballance of Europe. Then the lord-chan∣cellor prorogued the parliament to the twenty-ninth day of August; but on the seventh of that month a proclamation was issued for dissolving this and con∣voking another.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>In the interim some changes were made in different departments of civil oeconomy. Lord viscount Torrington was placed at the head of the ad∣miralty: the earl of Westmoreland was appointed first lord-commissioner of trade and plantations. Philip Dormer Stanhope, earl of Chesterfield, a nobleman remarkable for his wit, eloquence, and polished manners, was nominated am∣bassador
<PB N="523" REF="5260"/>
to the Hague. The privy-council being dissolved, another was appointed of the members then present. The duke of Devonshire was dignified with the place of president; and the duke of St. Alban's was ap∣pointed master of the horse. On the eleventh day of October the coronation of the king and queen was performed at Westminster-abbey, with the usual so∣lemnity <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">King George II. ascended the throne in the forty-fourth year of his age. On the second day of September, one thousand seven hundred and five, he espoused the princess Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline, daughter to John Frederick marquis of Brandenburgh-Anspach, by whom he had two sons, Frederic Lewis prince of Wales, born at Hanover on the thirty-first day of January, one thousand seven hundred and seven; and William Augustus, born at London on the fifteenth day of April, one thousand seven hundred and twenty-one: she had likewise borne four princesses, namely, Anne, Amelia, Carolina, Mary, and was afterwards delivered of Louisa, married in the sequel to the king of Denmark.</NOTE>. By this time the courts of France and Spain were perfectly recon∣ciled: all Europe was freed from the calamities of war; and the peace of Great-Britain suffered no interruption, except from some transient tumults among the tinners of Cornwal, who, being provoked by a scarcity of corn, rose in arms, and plundered the granaries of that county.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>The elections in England and Scotland for the parliament having suc∣ceeded on the new system, according to the wishes of the ministry, the two houses met on the twenty-third day of January, when the commons unanimously chose for their speaker Arthur Onslow esquire, knight of the shire for Surrey, a gentleman of extensive knowledge, worth, and probity, grave, eloquent, ve∣nerable, and every way qualified for the discharge of that honourable and im∣portant office. The king, in his speech to this new parliament, declared, that by the last advices from abroad, he had reason to hope the difficulties which had hitherto retarded the execution of the preliminaries, and the opening of the congress, would soon be intirely removed: in the mean time he represented the absolute necessity of continuing the preparations which had hitherto secured the nation, and prevented an open rupture in Europe. He promised, that his first care should be to reduce from time to time the expence of the public, as often, and as soon as the interest and safety of his people would permit such reduction. He expressed an earnest desire of seeing the foundation layed of an effectual scheme for the increase and encouragement of seamen in general, that they might be invited rather than compelled into the service of their country. Fi∣nally, he recommended unanimity, zeal, and dispatch of the public business. Those speeches, penned by the minister, were composed with a view to soothe the minds of the people into an immediate concurrence with the measures of the government; but without any intention of performing those promises of oeco∣nomy, reformation, and national advantage. The two houses seemed to vie with each other in expressions of applause and affection to his majesty. The lords, in their address, hailed him as the best of kings, and true father of his country. The commons expressed the warmest sense of gratitude for the bles∣sings they enjoyed in his reign, though it was not yet eight months old. They approved of all his transactions; promised to support him in all his undertak∣ings; and declared they would chearfully grant whatever supplies should be wanted for the public service. Having considered the estimates which were
<PB N="524" REF="5270"/>
layed before them by order of his majesty, they voted two and twenty thou∣sand, nine hundred and fifty-five men for guards and garrisons; and fifteen thou∣sand seamen for the service of the ensuing year. They granted two hundred and thirty thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three pounds, for the main∣tenance of twelve thousand Hessian troops; a subsidy of fifty thousand pounds to the king of Sweden; and half that sum to the duke of Brunswick Wolfembuttle. The expence of the year amounted to four millions, raised by a land-tax of three shillings in the pound, a malt-tax, and by borrowing of the bank one million, seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds; for which annuities to the amount of seventy thousand pounds, to be raised by duties on coals im∣ported into the city of London, were granted to that corporation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>All these sums, however, were not granted without question. The number of land forces occasioned a debate; and the Hessian auxiliaries were not allowed without dispute and opposition. When they deliberated on the loan of the bank, Mr. W. Pulteney observed, that the shifting of funds was but perpetuating taxes, and putting off the evil day: that notwithstanding the great merit which some persons had built on the sinking fund, it appeared that the national debt had been increased since the setting-up that pompous project. Some warm altercation passed between him and Sir Robert Walpole on this subject. The lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of London, presented a peti∣tion, setting forth, that the duties already layed upon coals and culm imported into London, affected the trade of that city only; that the inequality of the burthen was a great discouragement to their manufactures, and an hardship upon all the tracing inhabitants. The petition was rejected, and the tax im∣posed. The house having addressed the king for a particular and distinct ac∣count of the distribution of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, charged to have been issued for securing the trade and navigation of the kingdom, and preserving and restoring the peace of Europe; he declined granting their request, but signified in general, that part of the money had been issued and disbursed by his late majesty, and the remainder by himself, for carrying on the same necessary services, which required the greatest secrecy. Such a message in the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ch. 1728.</NOTE> reign of king William would have raised a dangerous flame in the house of commons. Mr. W. Pulteney inveighed against such a vague and general way of accounting for the public money, as tending to render parliaments altogether insignificant, to cover embezzlements, and to screen corrupt and rapacious mini∣sters. The commons having taken into consideration the state of the national debt, examined the accounts, and interrogated the proper officers; a motion was made by a court-member, that it appeared the monies already issued and applied towards discharging the national debts, together with a sum to be issued at Lady∣day, amounted to six millions six hundred forty-eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-two pounds, five shillings, one penny, one farthing. In vain did the leaders of the opposition expose the fallacious tendency of this motion. In vain did they demonstrate the fraudulent artifice used in drawing up the accounts: the motion was carried; and several resolutions were taken on the state of the national debts. In the particular account of these debts, upon which the house resolved to form a representation to his majesty, an article of three hundred thousand pounds relating to the duty upon wrought plate, was totally omitted. This extraordinary omission being discovered, gave rise to a very warm debate,
<PB N="525" REF="5280"/>
and to very severe reflections against those who superintended the public accounts. This error being rectified, a committee appointed for the purpose drew up the representation, containing a particular detail of the national debts discharged and incurred since the twenty-fifth day of December, in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen, with a state of the sinking fund and of the public credit. The draught being approved by the house, was presented to the king, who received it graciously. He took this opportunity of saying, that the pro∣vision made for gradually discharging the national debt was now become so certain and considerable, that nothing but some unforeseen event could alter or diminish it: a circumstance that afforded the fairest prospect of seeing the old debts discharged, without any necessity of incurring new incumbrances.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>This answer, fraught with many other expressions of fatherly tender∣ness for his people, paved the way for a message to the house, demanding a vote of credit to fulfil certain engagements entered into, and concerted with the ad∣vice and concurrence of the last parliament, for securing the trade and naviga∣tion of the kingdom, and for restoring and preserving the peace of Europe. Though a debate ensued upon this message, the majority resolved that an ad∣dress should be presented to his majesty, declaring the duty and fidelity of the commons, their entire confidence in his royal care and goodness, and their readiness to enable his majesty to fulfil his engagements. A vote of credit passed accordingly. During this session, the peers were chiefly employed in examining copies of several treaties and alliances which the king submitted to their perusal: they likewise prepared a bill for amending the statute of limita∣tion, which however did not pass into a law: they considered the state of the national debt a subject fruitful of debates: they passed the mutiny-bill, and those that were sent up from the commons, touching the supplies; together with an act, obliging ships arriving from infected places to perform quarentine; and some others of a more private nature. These bills having received the royal assent, the king closed the session on the twenty-eighth day of May, when he thanked the commons for the effectual supplies they had raised, and in particular, for having impowered him to borrow five hundred thousand pounds for the discharge of wages due to the seamen employed in the navy.</P>

<P>England was at this period quite barren of remarkable events. The king's uncle Ernest Augustus, prince of Brunswic, duke of York and bishop of Osnabrug, died on the third day of August, and was succeeded in the bishop∣ric by the elector of Cologn, according to the pactum by which Osnabrug is alternately possessed by the house of Brunswic and that elector. In the be∣ginning of December, his majesty's eldest son prince Frederic arrived in Eng∣land from Hanover, where he had hitherto resided; was introduced into the privy council, and created prince of Wales. Signior Como, resident from the duke of Parma, was ordered to quit the kingdom, because his master payed to the pretender the honours due to the king of Great-Britain. The congress opened at Soissons, for determining all disputes among the powers of Europe, proved ineffectual. Such difficulties occurred in settling and reconciling so many different pretensions and interests, that the contracting parties in the alliance of Hanover, proposed a provisional treaty, concerning which no defi∣nitive answer was given as yet by the courts of Vienna and Madrid. The fate of Europe, therefore, continued in suspence: the English fleet lay inactive and
<PB N="526" REF="5290"/>
rotting in in the West-Indies: the sailors perished miserably, without daring to avenge their country's wrongs; while the Spanish cruisers committed depreda∣tions with impunity on the commerce of Great-Britain. The court of Spain, at this juncture, seemed cold and indifferent with regard to a pacification with England. It had renewed a good understanding with France, and now strengthened its interest by a double alliance of marriage with the royal family of Portugal. The i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta of this house was betrothed to the prince of Astu∣rias; while the Spanish infanta formerly affianced to the French king, was now matched with the prince of Brazil, eldest son of his Portuguese majesty. In the month of January, the two courts met in a wooden house built over the little river Coya that separates the two kingdoms, and there the princesses were exchanged.</P>

<P>The parliament of Great-Britain meeting according to their last pro∣rogation on the twenty-first day of January, the king in his speech communicated the nature of the negotiation at the congress; demanded such supplies as might enable him to act vigorously in concert with his allies, provided his endeavours to establish an advantageous peace should miscarry; and he hinted, that the dila∣tory conduct of the courts of Vienna and Madrid proceeded in a great mea∣sure from the hopes that were given, of creating discontents and divisions among the subjects of Great-Britain. This suggestion was a ministerial artifice to inflame the zeal and resentment of the nation, and intimidate the members in the opposition. Accordingly the hint was pursued, and in the addresses from both houses, that could not fail of being agreeable, considering the manner in which they were dictated, particular notice was taken of this article: both peers and commons expressed their detestation and abhorrence of those, who by such base and unnatural artifices, suggested the means of distressing their country, and clamoured at the inconveniencies which they themselves had occasioned. In these addresses, likewise, the parliament congratulated his majesty on the arrival of the prince of Wales in his British dominions; and the commons sent a particular compliment to his royal highness on that occasion. The estimates having been examined in the usual form, the house voted fifteen thousand seamen for the ensuing year; but the motion for conti∣nuing the same number of land-forces which had been allowed in the preceding year, was not carried without dispute. All the arguments against a standing army in time of peace, as inconsistent with the British constitution, and dan∣gerous to the liberties of the people, were repeated with great vivacity by Mr. Shippen and Mr. W. Pulteney. These, however, were answered and re∣presented as absurd, by Mr. Horatio Walpole and Mr. D. two staunch adherents of the minister. The first had, in despite of nature, been employed in different negotiations: he was blunt, aukward and slovenly: an ora∣tor without eloquence, an ambassador without dignity, and a plenipotentiary without address. The other had natural parts and acquired knowledge; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oke with confidence; and in dispute was vain, sarcastic, petulant, and verbose.</P>

<P>The subsidies to Sweden, Hesse-Cassel, and Wolfembuttle, were conti∣nued, notwithstanding the remonstrances of Sir Joseph Jekyll, Mr. Lutwyche, and Mr. Pulteney; which last observed, that as the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, and the duke of Brunswick Wolfembuttle, usually maintained a certain number
<PB N="527" REF="5300"/>
of troops in their pay, it was but reasonable that Great-Britain should defray no more than the expence of the additional forces which those powers had raised, in consequence of their conventions with the king of England. Sir Robert Walpole perceiving, that this remark made an impression on the house, thought it necessary to vindicate his measure: he expatiated upon the wisdom of the late king, in concluding the Hanover alliance. He affirmed, that the convention with Hesse-Cassel had prevented a war in the empire, for which the court of Vienna had made great preparations: that the emperor had not only augmented his own forces by the help of Spanish subsidies, but also retained the troops of three electors; and if he had not been overawed by the Hes∣sians, would certainly have rejected the preliminaries, and all other advances towards a pacification: that therefore they ought not to grudge an expence which had already proved so beneficial to the tranquillity of Europe. Sir Joseph Jekyll replied, that whatever gloss might be put upon such measures, they were repugnant to the maxims by which England in former times had steered and squared its conduct with relation to its interest abroad: that the navy was the natural strength of Great-Britain; its best defence and security: but, if in order to avoid a war, they should be so free-hearted as to buy and maintain the forces of foreign princes, they were never like to see an end of such extravagant expences. This gentleman, who exercised the office of master of the rolls, had approved himself a zealous defender of whig principles, was an able law∣yer, a sensible speaker, and a conscientious patriot. The supplies were raised by a continuation of the land-tax, the duties upon malt, cyder and perry, an additional imposition on unmalted corn used in distilling, and by sale of annui∣ties to the bank, not exceeding fifty thousand pounds per annum.</P>

<P>Petitions were delivered to the house of commons from the merchants of London, Liverpool, and Bristol, complaining of the interruptions they had suffered in their trade for several years, by the depredations of the Spaniards in the West-Indies. These being considered, the house ordered the lords of the admiralty to produce the other memorials of the same kind which they had received, that they might be layed before the congress at Soissons; and ad∣dressed his majesty for copies of all the letters and instructions which had been sent to admiral Hosier, and those who succeeded him in the command of the West-India squadron. Mr. Oglethorpe having been informed of shocking cruelties and oppressions exercised by gaolers upon their prisoners, moved for an examination into these practices, and was chosen chairman of a committee ap∣pointed to enquire into the state of the gaols of the kingdom. They began with the Fleet-prison, which they visited in a body: there they found Sir Wil∣liam Rich, baronet, loaded with irons, by order of Bambridge the warden, to whom he had given some slight cause of offence. They made a discovery of many inhuman barbarities which had been committed by that russian, and detected the most iniquitous scenes of fraud, villany, and extortion. When the report was made by the committee, the house unanimously resolved, that Thomas Bambridge, acting warden of the Fleet, had wilfully permitted several debtors to escape; had been guilty of the most notorious breaches of trust, great ex∣tortions, and the highest crimes and misdemeanours in the execution of his office; that he had arbitrarily and unlawfully loaded with irons, put into dun∣geons, and destroyed prisoners for debt, under his charge, treating them in
<PB N="528" REF="5310"/>
the most barbarous and cruel manner, in high violation and contempt of the laws of the kingdom. A resolution of the same nature passed against John Huggins, esquire, who had been warden of the Fleet-prison. The house presented an address to the king, desiring he would direct his attorney-general forthwith, to prosecute these persons and their accomplices, who were committed prisoners to Newgate. A bill was brought in, disabling Bambridge to execute the office of warden: another for the better regulating the prison of the Fleet; and for more effectual preventing and punishing arbitrary and illegal practices of the warden of the said prison.</P>

<P>Other merchants complained by petition of the losses sustained by the Spaniards. The house, in a grand committee, deliberated on this subject, inquired into the particulars, examined evidence, and drew up an address to the king, desiring his majesty would be graciously pleased to use his utmost en∣deavours for preventing such depredations; for procuring just and reasonable satisfaction; and for securing to his subjects the free exercise of commerce and navigation to and from the British colonies in America. The king assured them he would use his best endeavours to answer the desires and expectations of his people, in an affair of so much importance: and they, in another address, thanked him for his gracious answer. They did not, however, receive such a satisfactory reply to a former address, touching the sum of sixty thousand pounds that had been stated in the public account, without specification of the particular uses to which it was applied. He told them the money had been issued and disbursed for secret services; and, that a distinct and particular account of the distribution of it could not be given without a manifest prejudice to the public. A bill was prepared for the more effectual preventing bribery and corruption in elections for members of parliament; and it passed through the house without opposition: but, their attention was chiefly employed upon the Spanish depre∣dations, which had raised a great clamour through the whole kingdom, and excited very warm disputes in parliament; for they were generally reputed the fruits of negligence, incapacity, or want of vigour in the ministers. The com∣mons having made further progress in the inquiry, and received fresh petitions from the merchants, passed some resolutions, in which the Spaniards were ac∣cused of having violated the treaties subsisting between the two crowns; and with having treated inhumanly the masters and crews of ships belonging to Great-Britain. They justified the instructions given to admiral Hosier to seize and detain the flota and galleons of Spain, until justice and satisfaction should be rendered to his majesty and his allies; nay, even declared, that such seizure would have been just, prudent, and necessary, tending to prevent an open rup∣ture; and to preserve the peace and tranquillity of Europe.<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> They again ad∣dressed the king, to use his endeavours to procure satisfaction; and he promised to comply with their request.</P>

<P>Mr. Scrope, member for Bristol, moved for an address, intreating his majesty to order an account of the produce of the civil list revenues for one year to be layed before the house. The address was presented, the account pro∣duced; and the house, in a grand committee, took this affair into consideration. The courtiers affirmed, that they fell short of the eight hundred thousand pounds settled upon his majesty; and Mr. Scrope proposed, that the sum of one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds should be granted to the king, on account of those
<PB N="529" REF="5320"/>
deficiencies and arrears. The motion was vigorously opposed by Mr. Pulten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y and other members. They expressed their surprize that it should be made so late in the session, when no further demand of money could be reasonably ex∣pected; and they said, it was the more extraordinary, because it appeared in the former session, from the examination of the accounts then before the house, that the revenues of the civil-list produced yearly a much greater sum than that for which they were given. Mr. Pulteney moved, that the accounts and papers should be referred to the examination of a select committee, properly impowered to investigate the truth. The ministers opposed this motion; and the question being put, it passed in the negative. The majority voted the sum demanded; and in a bill for settling the price of imported corn, they inserted the resolution for granting to his majesty the sum of one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds, on account of arrears due on the civil list revenues.</P>

<P>The house of lords having prepared a bill for the more effectual pu∣nishment of forgery, which was passed into a law, and ordered the judges to bring in another, on the report of a committee appointed to consider the case of imprisoned debtors; at length, deliberated upon the state of the nation, parti∣cularly, the positive demand made by the court of Spain for the restitution of Gibraltar, grounded on a letter written by the late king to his catholic majesty. From a copy of the letter layed before the house, it plainly appeared, that king George I. had consented to this restitution. A motion being made for a resolution, importing, that for the honour of his majesty, and the preservation and security of the trade and commerce of the kingdom, effectual care should be taken in the present treaty, that the king of Spain should renounce all claim and preten∣sion to Gibraltar and Minorca, in plain and strong terms; a debate ensued, and the question being put, passed in the negative, though not without a protest. Then the majority resolved, That the house did entirely rely upon his majesty, that he would, for maintaining the honour and securing the trade of this king∣dom, take effectual care in the present treaty, to preserve his undoubted right to Gibraltar and Minorca. When the house examined the papers relating to the Spanish depredations, many severe reflections were uttered against the conduct of the ministry; and a motion was made, to resolve, That Hosier's expedition was an unreasonable burthen on the nation; but, this too was rejected, and oc∣casioned another protest. Nor did the clause in the corn-bill, for granting one hundred and fifteen thousand pounds to his majesty, pass through the house of peers without warm opposition. Divers lords alledged, that instead of a defici∣ency in the civil list revenues, there was a considerable surplus: that this was a new grant, and a new burden on the people: that the nation was loaded, not to complete, but to augment the sum designed for the civil-list; and this at a time when the public debts were increased; when the taxes were heavily felt in all parts of the country; when the foreign trade of Britain was incumbered and diminished; when her manufactures were decayed; her poor multiplied; and she was surrounded by many other national calamities. They observed, that if the produce of the civil-list revenue should not amount to the yearly sum of eight hundred thousand pounds, the deficiency must be made good to his ma∣jesty by the public; whereas no provision was made, by which, if the produce of these revenues should exceed that sum, the surplus could accrue to the bene∣fit of the public: that by this precedent, not only real deficiencies were to be
<PB N="530" REF="5330"/>
made good, but also supplies were to be given for arrears standing out at the end of every year, which should come on before the supplies could be granted, though the supply given to make good arrears in one year, would certainly in∣crease the surplusage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in another: that the revenues of the civil list were varia∣ble in their own nature; and even when there is no deficiency in the produce, there might be arrears in the receipt: these might be easily increased by the management of designing ministers, by private directions to receive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and by artful methods of stating accounts. All these arguments, and oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r objections equally strong and plausible, against this unconscionable and unparliamentary motion, served only to evince the triumph of the ministry over shame and s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣timent, their contempt of public spirit, and their d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fiance of national <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣proach <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The peers that distingu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shed themselves in the opposition were Beaufort, Strafford, Craven, Fo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, Litchfield, Scarsdale, Gower, Mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>j<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, Plymouth, Bathur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, Northampton, Coventry, Oxford and Mortimer, Willoughby de Broke, Boyle, and Warrington.</NOTE>.</P>

At the same time two and thirty private bills were passed; then the king expressed his approbation of the parliament, signified his intention to visit his German dominions, and ordered the chancel∣lor to prorogue both houses. His majesty having appointed the queen regent of the realm, set out for Hanover on the seventeenth day of May, in order to remove a petty misunderstanding which had happened between that electorate and the court of Berlin. Some Hanoverian subjects had been pressed or decoyed into the service of Prussia; and the regents of Hanover had seized certain Prussian officers by way of reprisal. The whole united kingdom of Great-Britain at this juncture enjoyed uninterrupted repose; and commerce continued to increase, in spite of all restriction and discouragement. The people of Ireland found them∣selves happy under the government of lord Carteret; and their parliament, assembling in the month of September, approved themselves the fathers of their country. They established funds for the discharge of their national debt, and for maintaining the expence of government: they enacted wholesome laws for the encouragement of manufacture, trade, and agriculture; and they formed wise regulations in different branches of civil oeconomy. Some time after this sess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, which was conducted with so much harmony and patriotism, lord Car∣teret returned to England; and was succeeded by the duke of Dorset in the government of that kingdom.

Though the congress at Soissons proved abortive, conferences were begun at Seville, between the plenipotentiaries of England, France, and Spain; and a treaty was concluded on the ninth day of November, not only without the concurrence of the emperor, but even contrary to his right, as established by the quadruple alliance. On this subject he communicated an imperial commis∣sorial decree to the states of the empire assembled in the diet at Ratisbon, which was answered by the French minister De Chavigny. In October Peter II. czar of Muscovy, and grandson of Peter I. died in the fifteenth year of his age, at Moscow, and was succeeded on the Russian throne by the princess Anne Iva∣nowna, second daughter of John Alexowitz, elder brother of the first Peter, and widow of Frederick William duke of Courland.

<P>The British parliament assembling on the thirteenth day of January, the king gave them to understand, that the peace of Europe was now established by the treaty of Seville, built upon the foundation of former treaties, and tend∣ing to render more effectual what the contracting powers in the quadruple alli∣ance were before engaged to see performed. He assured them that all former conventions made with Spain in favour of the British trade and navigation, were renewed and confirmed: that the free uninterrupted exercise of their commerce was restored: that the court of Spain had agreed to an ample resti∣tution and reparation for unlawful seizures and depredations: that all rights, privileges, and possessions belonging to him and his allies, were solemnly re∣established, confirmed, and guarantied: and that not one concession was made to the prejudice of his subjects. He told them he had given orders for reduc∣ing a great number of his land-forces, and for laying up great part of the fleet; and observed, that there would be a considerable saving in the expence of the current year. After both houses had presented their addresses of thanks and congratulation to the king on the peace of Seville, the lords took that treaty into consideration; and it did not pass inquiry without severe animadversion.</P>

<P>The lords in the opposition excepted to the article by which the mer∣chants of Great-Britain were obliged to make proof of their losses at the court of Spain. They said, this stipulation was a hardship upon British subjects, and disho∣nourable to the nation: that few would care to undertake such a troublesome and expensive journey, especially as they had reason to apprehend their claims would be counterballanced by the Spaniards; and after all, they would have no more but the slender comfort of hoping to obtain that redress by commissaries which they had not been able to procure by plenipotentiaries. They thought it very extraordinary, that Great-Britain should be bound to ratify and guaranty whatever agreement should be made between the king of Spain and the dukes of Parma and Tuscany, concerning the garrisons once established in their countries: that the English should be obliged to assist in effectuating the introduction of six thousand Spanish troops into the towns of Tuscany and Parma, without any specification of the methods to be taken, or the charge to be incurred in giving that assistance: that they should guaranty for ever, not only to Don Carlos, but even to all his successors, the possession of the estates of Tuscany and Parma; a stipulation, which, in all probability, would involve Great-Britain in endless
<PB N="532" REF="5350"/>
quarrels and disputes, about a country with which they had no concern. They affirmed, that the treaty of Seville, instead of confirming other treaties, was contradictory to the quadruple alliance, particularly in the article of introduc∣ing Spanish troops into Fuscany and Parma, in the room of neutral forces sti∣pulated by the former alliance; and agreeing, that they should there remain until Don Caries and his successors should be secure and exempt from all events. They complained, that these alterations, from the tenour of the qua∣druple alliance, were made without the concurrence of the emperor, and even without inviting him to accede; an affront which might alienate his friendship from England, and hazard the loss of such an antient, powerful, and faithful ally: and, that throughout the whole treaty there seemed to be an artful omis∣sion of any express stipulation, to secure Great-Britain in her right to Gibral∣tar and Minorca. Such was the substance of the objections made to the peace: then lord Bathurst moved for a resolution, that the agreement on the treaty of Seville, to secure the succession of Don Carlos to the dutchies of Tuscany, Parma, and Placentia, with Spanish troops, was a manifest violation of the fifth article of the quadruple alliance, tending to involve the nation in a dangerous and ex∣pensive war, and to destroy the ballance of power in Europe. The question was put, and the motion rejected. Such too was the fate of other two mo∣tions, to resolve, That Great-Britain's right of sovereignty, dominion, posses∣sion, and claim to Gibraltar and Minorca, were not ascertained by the treaty of Seville: and, That the stipulations in that treaty, for repairing the losses of the British merchants, were insufficient and precarious. The majority, far from stigmatizing this transaction, resolved, That the treaty did contain all necessary stipulations for maintaining and securing the honour, dignity, rights, and pos∣sessions of the crown: that all due care was taken therein for the support of the trade of the kingdom, and for repairing the losses sustained by the British mer∣chants. On these resolutions an address of approbation was founded; but, when a motion was made for an address to his majesty, that he would order to be layed before the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of all pensions payable to the crown, it was im∣mediately resolved in the negative.

<P>Nor was the success of the court-interest in the house of commons altogether pure and free from exception and dispute. When the charge of the land-forces fell under the consideration of the commons, and Mr. Henry Pel∣ham, secretary at war, moved, that the number of the effective men for the land-service of the ensuing year, should be fixed at seventeen thousand seven hun∣dred and nine; Mr. Pulteney insisted upon its being reduced to twelve thou∣sand. Mr. Shippon affirmed, that Mr. Polham's motion was a fiat negative to the address for which he voted on the first day of the session, as it plainly im∣plied a distrust of the validity of the late treaty, which he then assured the house, would immediately produce all the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of an absolute <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eace; and deliver the kingdom from the apprehensions and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a war. He said, the motion tended directly towards the establishment of an army in Great-Britain, which, he hoped, would never be so far germanized, as tamely to submit
<PB N="533" REF="5360"/>
to a military government. He observed, that the nation could have no occa∣sion for all the troops that were demanded, considering the glorious scene of affairs which was now opened to all Europe. <Q>“They are not necessary (said he) to awe Spain into a firm adherence to its own treaty: they are not ne∣cessary to force the emperor into an immediate accession; nor are they in any sort necessary for the safety of his majesty's person and government. Force and violence are the resort of usurpers and tyrants only; because they are, with good reason, distrustful of the people whom they oppress; and, be∣cause they have no other security for the continuance of their unlawful and unnatural dominion, than what depends entirely on the strength of their ar∣mies.”</Q> The motion, however, was carried in the affirmative.</P>

<P>Another warm debate was excited by a bill which the courtiers brought in, to prevent any subjects of Great-Britain from advancing sums of money to foreign princes or states, without having obtained licence from his ma∣jesty, under his privy-seal, or some greater authority. The minister pretended, that this law was proposed to disable the emperor, who wanted to borrow a great sum of the English merchants, for raising and maintaining troops to dis∣turb the tranquillity of Europe. The bill contained a clause, impowering the king to prohibit by proclamation, all such loans of money, jewels, or bullion; and the attorney-general to compel, by English bill, in the court of exchequer, the effectual discovery, on oath, of any such loans; and, that in default of an answer to any such bill, the court should decree a limited sum against the person refusing to answer. Mr. Daniel Pulteney, a gentleman of uncommon talents and ability, and particularly acquainted with every branch of commerce, argued strenuously against this bill, as a restraint upon trade that would render Hol∣land the market of Europe, and the mart of money to the nations of the con∣tinent. He said, that by this general prohibition, extending to all princes, states, or potentates, the English were totally disabled from assisting their best allies: that among others the king of Portugal frequently borrowed money of the English merchants residing within his dominions: that while the licensing power remained in the crown, the licences would be issued through the hands of the minister, who by this new trade might gain twenty, thirty, or forty thousand a-year: that the bill would render the exchequer a court of inquisition; and that whilst it restrained our merchants from assisting the princes and powers of Europe, it permitted our stock-jobbers to trade in their funds without interrup∣tion. Other arguments of equal weight were enforced by Mr. Barnard, a mer∣chant of London, who perfectly understood trade in all its branches, spoke with judgment and precision, and upon all occasions steadily adhered to the interests and liberties of his country. After having explained his reasons, he declared he should never consent to a bill which he deemed a violation of our fundamen∣tal laws, a branch of our dearest liberties, and a very terrible hardship on man∣kind. Sir William Wyndham distinguished himself on the same side of the question; but the bill was vindicated by Sir Robert Walpole, Mr. Pelham, and Sir Philip Yorke attorney-general; and being supported by the whole weight of ministerial influence, not only passed through the house, but was afterwards enacted into a law.</P>

<P>On the fifteenth day of May the king went to the house of peers, and closed the session. In his speech he expressed his joy, that notwithstanding all the clamours which were raised, the parliament had approved of those mat∣ters which fell under their consideration; a circumstance, which, he said, could not fail to inspire all mankind with a just detestation of those incendiaries, who, by scandalous libels, laboured to alienate the affections of his people; to fill their minds with groundless jealousies and unjust complaints, in dishonour of him and his government; and in defiance of the sense of both houses of par∣liament <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the course of this session the commons raised a bill for making more effectual the laws in being, for disabling persons from being chosen members of parl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ament who enjoyed any pension during pleas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re, or for any number of years, or any offices holden in trust for them, by obliging all persons hereafter to be chosen to serve for the commons in parliament, to take the oath therein mentioned. In all probability this bill would not have made its way through the house of com∣mon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, had not the minister been well assured it would stick with the upper house, where it was rejected at the second reading, though not without v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olent opposition.</NOTE>. The emperor was so much incensed at the insult offered to him in the treaty of Seville, with respect to the garrisons of Tuscany and Parma, that he prohibited the subjects of Great-Britain from trading in his dominions: he
<PB N="535" REF="5380"/>
began to make preparations for war; and actually detached bodies of troops to Italy, with such dispatch as had been very seldom exerted by the house of Austria. Yet the article of which he complained was not so much a real injury as an affront put upon the head of the empire; for the eventual succession to those Italian dutch es had been secured to the infant Don Carlos by the quadru∣ple alliance; and all that the emperor required, was that this prince should re∣ceive the investiture of them as fiefs of the empire.</P>

<P>In Great-Britain, this year was not distinguished by any transaction of great moment. Seven chiefs of the Cherokee nation of Indians in Ame∣rica, were brought to England by Sir Alexander Cumin, and introduced to the king, at whose feet they layed their crown and regalia; and by an authentic deed acknowledged themselves subjects to his dominion, in the name of all their compatriots, who had vested them with full powers for this purpose. They were amazed and confounded at the riches and magnificence of the British court: they compared the king and queen to the sun and moon, the princes to the stars of heaven, and themselves to nothing. They gave their assent in the most so∣lemn manner to articles of friendship and commerce, proposed by the lords commissioners for trade and plantations: and being loaded with presents of ne∣cessaries, arms, and ammunition, were reconveyed to their own country, which borders on the province of South Carolina. In the month of September a sur∣prising revolution was effected at Constantinople, without bloodshed or confusion. A few mean janissaries displayed a flag in the streets, exclaiming, that all true Mussulmans ought to follow them, and assist in reforming the government. They soon increased to the number of one hundred thousand; marched to the seraglio, and demanded the grand vizir, the kiaja, and captain bachau. These unhappy ministers were immediately strangled. Their bodies being delivered to the insur∣gents, were dragged through the streets; and afterwards thrown to the dogs to be devoured. Not contented with this sacrifice, the revolters deposed the grand signor Achment, who was confined to the same prison, from whence they brought his nephew Machmout, and raised him to the throne, after he had lived seven and twenty years in confinement.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>England was at this period infested with robbers, assassins, and in∣cendiaries, the natural consequences of degeneracy, corruption, and the want of police in the interior government of the kingdom. This defect, in a great measure, arose from an absurd notion, that laws necessary to prevent those acts of cruelty, violence, and rapine, would be incompatible with the liberty of British subjects; a notion that confounds all distinctions between liberty and brutal licentiousness, as if that freedom was desirable, in the enjoyment of which people find no security for their lives or effects. The peculiar depravity of the times was visible even in the conduct of those who preyed upon the com∣monwealth. Thieves and robbers were now become more desperate and sa∣vage than ever they had appeared since mankind were civilized. In the exer∣cise of their rapine, they wounded, maimed, and even murdered the unhappy sufferers, through a wantonness of barbarity. They circulated letters, demand∣ing sums of money from certain individuals, on pain of reducing their houses to ashes, and their families to ruin; and even set fire to the house of a rich mer∣chant in Bristol, who had refused to comply with their demand. The same species of villany was practised in different parts of the kingdom; so that the
<PB N="536" REF="5390"/>
government was obliged to interpose, and offer a considerable reward for dis∣covering the russians concerned in such execrable designs.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>In the speech with which the king opened the session of parliament on the twenty-first day of January, he told them, that the present critical con∣juncture seemed in a very particular manner to deserve their attention: that as the transactions then depending in the several courts of Europe were upon the point of being determined, the great event of peace or war might be very much af∣fected by their first resolutions, which were expected by different powers with great impatience. He said, the continuance of that zeal and vigour with which they had hitherto supported him and his engagements, must at this time be of the greatest weight and importance, both with regard to his allies, and to those who might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> before the season of action, to prevent by an accommo∣dation the fatal consequences of a general rupture. The former scene was re∣peated. Both houses, in their addresses, promised to support his majesty in all his engagements though the members in the opposition demonstrated the ab∣surdity of promising to fulfil engagements before they could possibly know whe∣ther or not they were for the service of Great-Britain. Another bill was brought into the house of commons, to prevent pensioners from sitting as members of parliament; and, after a third reading, carried up to the lords for their concurrence. When the supply fell under consideration, the debates were re∣newed upon the subsidies to the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel and the duke of Wolfembuttle, which, however, were continued; and every article was granted according to the estimates given in for the expence of the ensuing year. Two petitions being presented to the commons, representing the delays of justice, oc∣casioned by the use of the Latin tongue in proceedings at law; a bill was brought in for changing this practice, and enacting, that all those processes and pleadings should be entered in the English language. Though one would imagine, that very little could be advanced against such a regulation, the bill met with warm opposition, on pretence that it would render useless the antient records which were written in that language, and introduce confusion and de∣lay of justice, by altering the established form and method of pleading; in spite of these objections it passed through both houses, and obtained the royal assent. A great number of merchants from different parts of the kingdom, having re∣peated their complaints of depredations and cruelties committed by the Spani∣ards in the West-Indies; their petitions were referred to the consideration of a grand committee. Their complaints, upon examination, appeared to be well founded. The house presented an address to the king, desiring his majesty would be graciously pleased to continue his endeavour to prevent such depredations for the future; to procure full satisfaction for the damages already sustained; and to secure to the British subjects the full and uninter∣rupted exercise of their trade and navigation to and from the British colonies in America. The bill against pensions produced a warm debate in the house of lords, where it was violently opposed by the dukes of Newcastle and Argyle, the earl of Hay, and Dr. Sherlock bishop of Bangor. This prelate, in a re∣markable speech, represented it as a scheme to enlarge the power of the house of commons; and to break the ballance between the powers essential to the con∣stitution, so as sooner or later to prove the ruin of the whole. The great bar∣rier provided against bribery and corruption by this bill, consisted in an oath to
<PB N="537" REF="5400"/>
be imposed on all members of the lower house, by which they must have so∣lemnly sworn and declared, that they had not directly nor indirectly, any pen∣sion during pleasure, or for any number of years, or any office in part, or in the whole, held for them or for their benefit, by any persons whatsoever; and, that they would not accept any such pensions or offices, without signifying the same to the house within fourteen days after they should be received or accepted. The bill was vindicated as just and necessary by the earls of Winchelsea and Strafford, the lord Bathurst, and the lord Carteret, who had by this time joined as an auxiliary in the opposition.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 17<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> The house of peers proceeded to consider the state of the national debt: they read a bill for the free importation of wool from Ireland into Eng∣land, which was fiercely opposed, and layed aside, contrary to all the rules of sound policy. They passed the bill for carrying on proceedings at law in the English language; and a fruitless motion was made by the lord Bathurst for an address, to desire his majesty would give directions for discharging the Hessian troops that were in the pay of Great-Britain. On the seventh day of May the parliament was prorogued, after the king had given them to understand, that all apprehensions of war were now happily removed, by a treaty signed at Vienna between him and the emperor. He said it was communicated to the courts of France and Spain, as parties to the treaty of Seville, the execution of which it principally regarded; and, that it was likewise submitted to the con∣sideration of the states-general. He observed, that the conditions and engage∣ments into which he had entered on this occasion, were agreeable to that neces∣sary concern which the British nation must always have for the security and pre∣servation of the ballance of power in Europe: that this happy turn, duly im∣proved with a just regard to former alliances, yielded a favourable prospect of seeing the public tranquillity re-established.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>In the month of January the duke of Parma died, after having made a will, in which he declared his dutchess was three months advanced in her pregnancy; intreating the allied powers of Europe to have compassion upon his people, and defer the execution of their projects until his consort should be delivered. In case the child should be still-born, or die after the birth, he bequeathed his dominions and allodial estates to the infant Don Carlos of Spain; and appointed five regents to govern the dutchy. Notwithstanding this disposition, a body of Imperial troops immediately took possession of Parma and Placentia, under the command of general Stampa, who declared they should conduct themselves with all possible regularity and moderation; and leave the administration intirely to the regents whom the duke had appointed. They publicly proclaimed in the market-place, that they took possession of these dutchies for the insant Don Carlos: and, that if the dutchess dowager should not be delivered of a prince, the said infant might receive the investiture from the emperor whenever he would, provided he should come without an army. Though these steps seemed to threaten an immediate war, the king of Great-Britain and the states-general interposed their mediation so effectually with the court of Vienna, that the emperor desisted from the prosecution of his design; and on the sixteenth day of March concluded at Vienna a treaty with his Britannic majesty, by which he consented to withdraw his troops from Parma and Placentia. He agreed, That the king of Spain might take possession of these places in fa∣vour
<PB N="538" REF="5410"/>
of his son Don Carlos, according to the treaty of Seville. He likewise agreed, That the Ostend company, which had given such umbrage to the mari∣time powers, should be totally dissolved, on condition that the contracting powers concerned in the treaty of Seville, should guaranty the pragmatic sanction, or suc∣cession of the Austrian hereditary dominions to the heirs female of the emperor, in case he should die without male issue. The Dutch minister residing at the Imperial court did not subscribe this treaty, because, by the maxims received in that re∣public, and the nature of her government, he could not be vested with full power<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so soon as it would have been necessary: nevertheless, the states-general were, by a separate article, expressly named as a principal contracting party.</P>

<P>On the twenty-second day of July a new treaty was signed at Vienna between the emperor, the kings of Great-Britain and Spain, tending to confirm the former. In August a treaty of union and defensive alliance between the electorates of Saxony and Hanover was executed at Dres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en. The court of Spain expressing some doubts with regard to the pregnancy of the dutchess of Parma, she underwent a formal examination by five midwives of different na∣tions, in presence of the older dutchess dowager, several ladies of quality, three physicians, and a surgeon; and was declared with child: nevertheless, after having kept all Europe in suspence for six months, she owned she had been de∣ceived; and general Stampa with the Imperial forces took formal possession of the dutchies of Parma and Placentia. Spain and the great duke of Tuscany having acceded to the last treaty of Vienna, the crown of Great-Britain engaged to equip an armament that should convoy Don Carlos to his new dominions. Accordingly Sir Charles Wager sailed with a strong squadron from Portsmouth on the twenty-sixth day of August; and in September arrived at Barcelona, where being joined by the Spanish fleet and transports, they sailed together to Leghorn; from whence the admiral returned to England. Don Carlos passed through part of France, and embarking at Antibes on board of the Spanish gal∣lies, arrived at Leghorn in December. Then the Imperial general withdrew his forces into the Milaneze; and the infant took possession of his new territories.</P>

<P>During these transactions France was distracted by religious dis∣putes, occasioned by the bull unigenitus thundered against the doctrines of Jan∣senius; a bull which had produced a schism in the Gallican church, and well nigh involved that country in civil war and confusion. It was opposed by the parliaments and lay-tribunals of the kingdom; but, many bishops, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esuits in general, were its most strenuous assertors. All the artifices of priest∣craft were practised on both sides, to inflame the enthusiasm, and manage the superstition of the people. Pretended miracles were wrought at the tomb of abbe Paris, who had died without accepting the bull, consequently was declared damned by the abettors of that constitution. On the other hand, the jesuits exerted all their abilities and industry in preaching against the Jansenists; in esta∣blishing an opinion of their superior sanctity; and inspiring a spirit of quietism among their votaries, who were transported into the delirium of possession, illu∣mination, and supernatural converse. These arts were often used for the most infamous purposes. Female enthusiasts were wrought up to such violence of agitations, that nature fainted under the struggle; and the pseudo-saint seized this opportunity of violating the chastity of his penitent. Such was said to be the case of mademoiselle la Cadiere, a young gentlewoman of Toulon, abused
<PB N="539" REF="5420"/>
in this manner by the lust and villany of pere Girard, a noted jesuit, who underwent a trial before the parliament of Aix, and very narrowly escaped the stake.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXX.</HEAD>
<P>The parliament of Great-Britain meeting on the thirteenth day of January, the king in his speech declared, that the general tranquillity of Eu∣rope was restored and established by the last treaty of Vienna: that Don Carlos was actually possessed of Parma and Placentia: that six thousand Spaniards were quietly admitted and quartered in the dutchy of Tuscany, to secure, by the ex∣press consent and agreement of the great duke, the reversion of his dominions: and, that a family-convention was made between the courts of Spain and Tus∣cany, for preserving mutual peace and friendship in the two houses. He told the commons, that the estimates for the service of the current year would be considerably less than those of former years. He recommended unanimity: he observed, that his government had no security but what was equally conducive to their happiness, and to the protection of his people: that their prosperity had no foundation but in the defence and support of his government. <Q>“Our safety (said he) is mutual, and our interests are inseparable.”</Q> The opposition to the court measures appears to have been uncommonly spirited during the course of this session. The minister's motions were attacked with all the artillery of elo∣cution. His principal emissaries were obliged to task their faculties to their full exertion, to puzzle and perplex where they could not demonstrate and convince; to misrepresent what they could not vindicate, and elude the arguments which they could not refute. In the house of commons lord Hervey, lately appointed vice-chamberlain of his majesty's houshold, made a motion for an address of thanks, in which they should declare their intire approbation of the king's con∣duct; acknowledge the blessings they enjoyed under his government; express their confidence in the wisdom of his counsels; and, declare their readiness to grant the necessary supplies. This member, son to the earl of Bristol, was a nobleman of some parts, which, however, were more specious than solid. He condescended to act as a subaltern to the minister, and approved himself extremely active in forwarding all his designs, whether as a secret emissary, or public orator; in which last capacity he appears to have been pert, frivolous, and srothy. His motion was seconded by Mr. Clutterbuck, and opposed by Sir Wilfred Lawson, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, Sir William Wyndham, and Mr. Oglethorpe. They did not argue against a general address of thanks; but, ex∣posed the absurdity and bad tendency of expressions which implied a blind ap∣probation of all the measures of the ministry. Sir Wilfred Lawson observed, that notwithstanding the great things we had done for the crown of Spain, and the favours we had procured for the royal family of that kingdom, little or no satisfaction had as yet been received for the injuries our merchants had sustained from that nation. Mr. Pulteney took notice, that the nation, by becoming gua∣ranty to the pragmatic sanction, layed itself under an obligation to assist the Austrian family when attacked by any potentate whatever, except the grand signor: that they might be attacked when it would be much against the interest of the kingdom to engage itself in a war upon any foreign account: that it might one day be for the interest of the nation to join against them, in order to pre∣serve the ballance of Europe, the establishing of which had already cost Eng∣land
<PB N="540" REF="5430"/>
such immense sums of money. He insisted upon the absurdity of conclud∣ing such a number of inconsistent treaties; and concluded with saying, that if affairs abroad were now happily established, the ministry which conducted them might be compared to a pilot, who, though there was a clear, safe, and straight channel into port, yet took it in his head to carry the ship a great way about, through sands, rocks, and shallows; who, after having lost a great number of seamen, destroyed a great deal of tackle and rigging, and subjected the owners to an enormous expence, at last, by chance, hits the port, and triumphs in his good conduct. Sir William Wyndham spoke to the same purpose. Mr. Oglethorpe, a gentleman of unblemished character, brave, generous, and humane, affirmed, that many other things related more nearly to the honour and interest of the nation, than did the guaranty of the pragmatic sanction. He said, he wished to have heard that the new works at Dunkirk had been intirely razed and destroyed: that the nation had received full and complete satisfaction for the depredations committed by the natives of Spain: that more care was taken in disciplining the militia, on whose valour the nation must chiefly depend in case of an invasion; and, that some regard had been shewn to the oppressed protestants in Germany. He expressed his satisfaction to find that the English were not so closely united to France as formerly; for he had generally observed, that when two dogs were in a leash together, the stronger generally ran away with the weaker; and this, he was afraid, had been the case between France and Great-Britain. The motion was vigorously defended by Mr. Pelham, pay∣master of the forces, and brother to the duke of Newcastle, a man whose greatest fault was his being concerned in supporting the measures of a corrupt ministry. In other respects he was liberal, candid, benevolent, and even at∣tached to the interest of his country, though egregiously mistaken in his notions of government. On this occasion he asserted, that it was no way inconsistent with the honour or dignity of that house, to thank his majesty in the most particular terms for every thing he had been pleased to communicate in his speech from the throne: that no expressions of approbation in the address could be any way made use of to prevent an inquiry into the measures which had been pursued, when the treaties should be layed before the house. He said, at the opening of a session the eyes of all Europe were turned towards Great-Britain, and from the parliament's first resolves, all the neighbouring powers judged of the unanimity that would ensue between his majesty and the representatives of his people: that their appearing jealous or diffident of his majesty's con∣duct, would weaken his influence upon the councils of foreign states and potentates, and perhaps put it out of his power to rectify any false step that might have been made by his ministers. His arguments were reinforced by a long speech from Mr. H. Walpole. The question was put, the motion carried, and the address presented.</P>

<P>The next subject of debate was the number of land-forces. When the supply fell under consideration, Sir W. Strickland, secretary at war, moved, that the same number which had been maintained in the preceding year should be continued in pay. On the other hand, lord Morpeth having demon∣strated the danger to which the liberties of the nation might be exposed, by main∣taining a numerous standing army in time of peace, made a motion that the
<PB N="541" REF="5440"/>
number should be reduced to twelve thousand. A warm dispure ensuing, was managed in favour of the first motion, by lord Hervey, Sir Robert Walpole and his brother, Mr. Pelham, Sir Philip Yorke attorney-general, who was counted a better lawyer than a politician, and shone more as an advocate at the bar, than as an orator in the house of commons. The last partisan of the ministry was Sir William Yonge, one of the lords commissioners of the trea∣sury, a man who rendered himself serviceable and necessary by stooping to all compliances, running upon every scent, and haranging on every subject with an even, uninterrupted, tedious flow of dull declamation, composed of asser∣tions without veracity, conclusions from false premises, words without mean∣ing, and language without propriety. Lord Morpeth's motion was espoused by Mr. Watkin Williams Wynne, a gentleman of an ancient family and opulent fortune in Wales, brave, open, hospitable, and warmly attached to the antient constitution and hierarchy: he was supported by Mr. Walter Plumer, who spoke with weight, precision, and severity; by Sir W. Wyndham, Mr. Shippen, Mr. W. Pulteney, and Mr. Barnard. The courtiers argued, that it was necessary to maintain such a number of land-forces as might deseat the designs of malcontents, secure the interior tranquillity of the kingdom, de∣fend it from external assaults, overawe its neighbours, and enable it to take vigorous measures in case the peace of Europe should be reimbro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led. They affirmed the science of war was so much altered, and required such attention, that no dependence was to be placed upon a militia: that all nations were obliged to maintain standing armies, for their security against the encroach∣ments of neighbouring powers: that the number of troops in Great-Britain was too inconsiderable to excite the jealousy of the people, even under an am∣bitious monarch: that his majesty never entertained the least thought of in∣fringing the liberties of his subjects: that it could not be supposed that the officers, among whom were many gentlemen of family and fortune, would ever concur in a design to enslave their country; and that the forces now in pay could not be properly deemed a standing army, inasmuch as they were voted and maintained from year to year by the parliament, which was the representa∣tive of the people. To these arguments the members in the opposition replied, that a standing force, in time of peace, was unconstitutional, and had been always thought dangerous: that a militia was as capable of discipline as a standing army, and would have more incentives to courage and perseverance: that the civil magistrate was able to preserve the peace of the country: and, that the number of the malcontents was altogether contemptible, though it might be considerably augmented by maintaining a standing army, and other such arbitrary measures: that other nations had been enslaved by standing armies; and how∣soever they might find themselves necessitated to depend upon a military force for security against incroaching neighbours, the case was very different with regard to Great-Britain, for the defence of which nature had provided in a pe∣culiar manner: that this provision was strengthened and improved by a nu∣merous navy, that secured to her the dominion of the sea; and if properly dis∣posed, would render all invasion impracticable, or at least ineffectual: that the land army of Great-Britain, though sufficient to endanger the liberties of an unarmed people, could not possibly secure such an extent of coast, and there∣fore could be of very little service in preventing an invasion: that though
<PB N="542" REF="5450"/>
they had all imag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>able considence in his majesty's regard for the liberty of his subjects, they could not help apprehending, that should a standing army be∣come part of the constitution, another prince of more dangerous talents, and more fatal designs, might ariss, and employ it for the worst purposes of am∣bition: that though many officers were gentlemen of honour and probity, these might be easily dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arded, and the army gradually moulded into a quite different temper. By these means, practised in former times, an army had been new-modelled to such a degree, that they turned their swords against the par∣liament, for whose defence they had been raised, and destroyed the constitu∣tion both in church and state: that with respect to its being wholly dependant on the parliament, the people of England would have reason to complain of the same hardship, whether a standing army should be declared at once indis∣pensible, or regularly voted from year to year, according to the direction of the ministry: that the sanction of the legislature granted to measures which in themselves are unconstitutional, burthensome, odious, and repugnant to the genius of the nation, instead of yielding consolation, would serve only to de∣monstrate, that the most effectual method of forging the chains of national slavery, would be that of ministerial influence operating upon a venal parlia∣ment. Such were the reasons urged against a standing army, of what num∣ber soever it might be composed: but the expediency of reducing the number from about eighteen thousand to twelve thousand, was insisted upon as the natural consequence of his majesty's declaration, by which they were given to understand, that the peace of Europe was established; and that he had nothing so much at heart as the ease and prosperity of his people. It was suggested, that if eighteen thousand men were sufficient, on the supposed eve of a general war in Europe, it was surely reasonable to think, that a less num∣ber would suffice when peace was perfectly re established. Whatever effect these reasons had upon the body of the nation, they made no converts in the house, where the majority resolved that the standing army should be main∣tained without reduction. Mr. Plumer complained, that the country was oppressed by an arbitrary method of quartering soldiers, in an undue propor∣tion, upon those publicans who refused to vote in elections, according to the direction of the ministry. Mr. Pult<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney asserted, that the money raised for the subsistence of eighteen thousand men in England, would maintain sixty thousand French or Germans, or the same number of almost any other people on the continent. Sir William Wyndham declared, that eighteen thousand of the English troops in the late war, were maintained on less than two-thirds of the sum now demanded for the like number: but no regard was paid to these allegations.</P>

<P>The next object of importance that attracted the notice of the house, was the state of the charitable corporation. This company was first erected in the year one thousand seven hundred and seven. Their professed intention was to lend money at legal interest, to the poor, upon small pledges; and to persons of better rank upon an indubitable security of goods im∣pawned. Their capital was at first limited to thirty thousand pounds; but, by licences from the crown, they increased it to six hundred thousand pounds, though their charter was never confirmed by act of parliament. In the month
<PB N="543" REF="5460"/>
of October, George Robinson, esq. member for Marlow, the cashier, and John Thompson, warehouse-keeper of the corporation, disappeared in one day. The proprietors, alarmed at this incident, held several general courts, and appointed a committee to inspect the state of their affairs. They reported, that for a capital of above five hundred thousand pounds, no equivalent was found; inasmuch as their effects did not amount to to the value of thirty thousand, the remainder having been embezzled by means which they could not discover. The proprietors, in a petition to the house of commons, represented, that by the most notorious breach of trust, in several persons to whom the care and management of their af∣fairs were committed, the corporation had been desrauded of the greatest part of their capital; and that many of the petitioners were reduced to the utmost degree of misery and distress: they therefore prayed, that as they were unable to detect the combinations of those who had ruined them, or to bring the delinquents to justice, without the aid of the power and authority of parliament, the house would vouchsafe to enquire into the state of the corporation, and the conduct of their managers; and give such relief to the petitioners, as to the house should seem meet. The petition was graciously received, and a secret committee appointed to proceed on the enquiry. They soon discovered a most iniquitous scene of fraud, which had been acted by Robinson and Thompson, in concert with some of the directors, for embezzling the capital, and cheating the pro∣prietors. Many persons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous conspiracy: some of the first characters in the nation did not escape suspicion and censure. Sir Robert Sutton and Sir Archibald Grant were expelled the house of commons, as having had a considerable share in those fraudulent practices: and a bill was brought in to restrain them and other delinquents from leaving the kingdom, or alienating their effects. In the mean time, the committee received a letter from signior John Angelo Belloni, an eminent banker at Rome, giving them to understand, that Thompson was secured in that city, with all his papers, and confined to the castle of St. Angelo; that the papers were transmitted to his correspondent at Paris, who should deliver them up, on certain conditions stipulated in favour of the prisoner. This letter was considered as an artifice to insinuate a favourable opinion of the pretender, as if he had taken measures for securing Thompson, from his zeal for justice, and affection to the English people. On this supposition, the proposals were rejected with disdain; and both houses concurred in an order, that the letter should be burned at the Royal Exchange, by the hands of the common hangman. The lower house resolved, that it was an insolent and audacious libel, absurd and contradictory; that the whole transaction a scanda∣lous artifice, calculated to delude the unhappy, and to disguise and conceal the wicked practices of the professed enemies to his majesty's person, crown, and dignity.</P>

<P>No motion, during this session, produced such a warm con∣test, as did that of Sir Robert Walpole, when, after a long preamble, he proposed that the duties upon salt, which about two years before had been abolished, should now be revived and granted to his majesty, his heirs and successors, for the term of three years. In order to sweeten this proposal, he declared that the land-tax for the ensuing year should be reduced

to one shilling in the pound. All the members of the country party were immediately in commotion. They expressed their surprize at the grossness of the imposition. They observed, that two years had scarce elapsed since the king, in a speech from the throne, had exhorted them to abolish some of the taxes that were the most burthensome to the poor: the house was then of opi∣nion, that the tax upon salt was the most burthensome, and the most perni∣cious to the trade of the kingdom, of all the impositions to which the poor were subjected, and therefore it was taken off: but that no good reason could be produced for altering their opinion so suddenly, and resolving to grind the faces of the poor, in order to ease a few rich men of the landed interest. They affirmed, that the most general taxes are not always the least burthensome: that after a nation is obliged to extend their taxes farther than the luxuries of their country, those taxes that can be raised with the least charge to the public, are the most convenient and the easiest to the people: but they ought carefully to avoid taxing those things which are necessary for the subsistence of the poor. The price of all necessaries being thus enhanced, the wages of the tradesmen and manufacturer must be increased; and, where these are high, the manu∣factures will be undersold by those of cheaper countries. The trade must of consequence be ruined; and it is not to be supposed that the landed gentle∣man would chuse to save a shilling in the pound from the land-tax, by means of an expedient that will ruin the manufactures of his country, and decrease the value of his own fortune. They alledged, that the salt-tax particularly affected the poor, who could not afford to eat fresh provisions; and that, as it formerly occasioned murmurs and discontents among the lower class of people, the revival of it would, in all probability, exasperate them into open sedition. They observed, that while it was exacted in England, a great number of mer∣chants sent their ships to Ireland to be victualled for their respective voyages; that, since it had been abolished, many experiments had been successfully tried with salt, for the improvement of agriculture, which would be entirely de∣feated by the revival of this imposition. They suggested, that the land-tax was raised at a very small expence, and subject to no fraud, whereas that upon salt would employ a great number of additional officers in the revenue, wholly depending upon the ministry, whose influence in elections they would proportion∣ably increase. They even hinted, that this consideration was one powerful motive for proposing the revival of an odious tax which was in effect an excise, and would be deemed a step towards a general excise upon all sorts of provisions. Finally, they demonstrated that the salt-tax introduced numberless frauds and perjuries in different articles of traffic. Sir Robert Walpole endeavoured to obviate all these objections in a long speech, which was minutely answered and refuted in every article by Mr. Pulteney. Nevertheless, the question being put, the minister's motion was carried in the affirmative, and the duty revived: yet, before the bill passed, divers motions were made, and additional clauses proposed by the members in the opposition. New debates were raised on every new objection, and the courtiers were obliged to dispute their ground by inches.</P>

through the lower house with great difficulty, but was lost among the peers: another for the better securing the freedom of parliaments, by farther quali∣fying members to sit in the house of commons, was read the third time, and thrown out upon the question. A committee had been appointed to enquire into a sale of the estate which had belonged to the late earl of Derwentwater. It appeared by the report, that the sale had been fraudulent: a bill was pre∣pared to make it void: Dennis Bond, esquire; and serjeans Birch, commissioners for the sale of the forseited estates, were declared guilty of notorious breach of trust, and expelled the house, of which they were members; George Ro∣binson, esquire, underwent the same sentence, on account of the part he acted in the charitable corporation, as he and Thompson had neglected to surrender themselves according to the terms of a bill which had passed for that purpose. During this session, five members of parliament were expelled for the most sordid acts of knavery: a sure sign of national degeneracy and dishonour. All the supplies were granted, and, among other articles, the sum of two and twenty thousand six hundred ninety four pounds seven shillings and sixpence, for the agio or difference of the subsidies payable to the crown of Denmark, in pursuance of the treaty subsisting between the late king and that monarch; but, this was not obtained without a violent dispute. Mr. Pulteney, who bore a considerable share in all these debates, became in a little time so remarkable as to be thought worthy of a very particular mark of his majesty's displeasure. The king, on the first day of July, called for the council-book, and with his own hand struck the name of William Pulteney, esquire, out of the list of privy-counsellors: his majesty farther ordered him to be put out of all the commissions of the peace. The several lords-lieutenant from whom he had received deputations, were commanded to revoke them; and the lord-chancellor and secretaries of state were directed to give the neces∣sary orders for that purpose.</P>

<P>Nor did the house of peers tamely and unanimously submit to the measures of the ministry. The pension-bill being read, was again rejected, and a protest entered. A debate arose about the number of standing forces: and the earl of Chesterfield argued for the court motion. The earl of Oxford moved, that they might be reduced to twelve thousand effective men. The earl of Win∣chelsea observed, that a standing army rendered ministers of state more daring than otherwise they would be, in contriving and executing projects that were grievous to the people: schemes that never could enter into the heads of any but those who were drunk with excess of power. The marquis of Twee dale, in reasoning against such a number as the ministry proposed, took occasion to observe, that not one shilling of the forfeited citates was ever applied to the use of the public: he likewise took notice, that the eighteen thousand men de∣manded as a standing force, were modelled in such a manner, that they might be speedily augmented to forty thousand men on any emergency. The duke of Argyle endeavoured to demonstrate the danger of depending for the safety of the kingdom upon an undisciplined militia, a fleet, or an army of auxiliaries. Then he represented the necessity of having recourse to a regular army in case of invasion; and after all acknowledged, that the number proposed was no way sufficient for that purpose.

<P>THE most remarkable incident that distinguished this year in Eng∣land was a very uncommon instance of suicide; an act of despair so frequent among the English, that in other countries it is objected to them as a national reproach. Though it may be generally termed the effect of lunacy proceeding from natural causes operating on the human body, in some few in∣stances it seems to have been the result of cool deliberation. Richard Smith, a bookbinder, and prisoner for debt within the liberties of the king's-bench, persuaded his wife to follow his example, in making away with herself, after they had murdered their little infant. This wretched pair was in the month of April found hanging in their bedchamber at about a yard's distance from
<PB N="548" REF="5510"/>
each other; and in a separate apartment the child lay dead in a cradle. They left two papers inclosed in a short letter to their landlord, whose kindness they implored in favour of their dog and cat. They even left money to pay the porter who should carry the inclosed papers to the person for whom they were addressed. In one of these the husband thanked that person for the marks of friendship he had received at his hands; and complained of the ill offices he had undergone from a different quarter. The other paper, subscribed by the hus∣band and wife, contained the reasons which induced them to act such a tragedy on themselves and their offspring. This letter was altogether surprising for the calm resolution, the good humour, and the propriety with which it was written. They declared, that they withdrew themselves from poverty and rags; evils, that through a train of unlucky accidents, were become inevitable. They appeal∣ed to their neighbours for the industry with which they had endeavoured to earn a livelihood. They justified the murder of their child, by saying, it was less cruelty to take her with them, than to leave her friendless in the world, exposed to igno∣rance and misery. They professed their belief and confidence in an Almighty God, the fountain of goodness and beneficence, who could not possibly take delight in the misery of his creatures: they therefore resigned up their lives to him without any terrible apprehensions; submitting themselves to those ways which, in his goodness, he should appoint after death. Those unfortunate suicides had been always industrious and frugal, invincibly honest, and re∣markable for conjugal affection.</P>

<P>Trustees having been appointed by charter to superintend a new settle∣ment in Georgia, situated to the southward of Carolina in America, Mr. Ogle∣thorpe, as general and governor of the province embarked at Gravesend, with a number of poor families to plant that colony. The king of Spain having equipped a very powerful armament, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet sailed on the fourth day of June from the road of Alicant, under the command of the count de Montemar, and arrived on the coast of Barbary in the neighbourhood of Oran, where a consi∣derable body of troops was landed without much opposition. Next day, however, they were attacked by a numerous army of Moors, over whom they obtained a complete victory. The bey or governor of Oran, immediately retired with his garrison, and the Spaniards took possession of the place, from which they had been driven in the year one thousand seven hundred and eight. The strong fort of Mazalaquivir was likewise surrendered to the victors at the first sum∣mons; so that this expedition answered all the views with which it had been projected. Victor Amadaeu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the abdicated king of Sardinia, having, at the instigation of his wife, engaged in some intrigues, in order to reascend the throne, his son, the reigning king, ordered his person to be seized at Montcalier, and conveyed to Rivoli, un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r a strong escorte. His wife, the marchioness de sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gno, was conducted to C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>va. The old king's confessor, his physician, and eight and forty persons of distinction, were imprisoned. The citadel of Turin was secured with a strong garrison: and new instructions were given to the go∣vernor and senate of Chambern. The dispute which had long subsisted between <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> king of Prussia and the young prince of Orange, touching the succession to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> possessed by king W<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am III. as head of the house of Orange, was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t last accommodated by a formal treaty signed at Berlin and Dieren.

<PB N="549" REF="5520"/>
by an inundation, occasioned by worms, which were said to have con∣sumed the piles and timber-work that supported their dykes. They prayed and fasted with uncommon zeal, in terror of this calamity, which they did not know how to avert in any other manner. At length, they were delivered from their fears by a hard frost, which effectually destroyed those dangerous animals. About this time, Mr. Dieden, plenipotentiary from the elector of Hanover, re∣ceived, in the name of his master, the investiture of Bremen and Verden from the hands of the emperor.</P>

<P>The history of England at this period cannot be very interesting, as it chiefly consists in an annual revolution of debates in parliament. Debates, in which the same arguments perpetually recur on the same subjects. When the session was opened on the sixteenth day of January, the king declared, that the situation of affairs both at home and abroad rendered it unnecessary for him to lay before the two houses any other reasons for calling them together, but the or∣dinary dispatch of the public business, and his desire of receiving their advice in such affairs as should require the care and consideration of parliament. The motion made in the house of commons for an address of thanks, implied, that they should express their satisfaction at the present situation of affairs both at home and abroad. The motion was carried, notwithstanding the opposition of those who observed, that the nation had very little reason to be pleased with the pre∣sent posture of affairs: that the French were employed in fortifying and restoring the harbour of Dunkirk, contrary to the faith of the most solemn treaties: that the British merchants had received no redress for the depredations committed by the Spaniards: that the commerce of England daily decreased: that no sort of trade throve but the traffic of Change-alley, where the most abominable frauds were practised: and, that every session of parliament opened a new scene of villany and imposition.</P>

<P>The pension-bill was once more revived, and lost again in the house of peers. All the reasons formerly advanced against a standing army were now repeated; and a reduction of the number insisted upon with such warmth, that the ministerial party were obliged to have recourse to the old phantom of the pretender. Sir Archer Croft said, a continuation of the same number of forces was the more necessary, because, to his knowledge, popery was increasing very fast in the country; for, in one parish which he knew, there were seven popish priests: and, that the danger from the pretender was the more to be feared<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> because they did not know but he was then breeding his son a protestant. Sir Ro∣bert Walpole observed, that a reduction of the army was the chief thing wished for, and desired by all the Jacobites in the kingdom: that no reduction had ever been made but what gave fresh hopes to that party, and encouraged them to raise tumults against the government; and, he did not doubt, but that if they should resolve to reduce any part of the army, there would be post-horses em∣ployed that very night to carry the good news beyond sea to the pretender. His brother Horatio added, that the number of troops then proposed was abso∣lutely necessary to support his majesty's government, and would be necessary as long as the nation enjoyed the happiness of having the present illustrious family on the throne. The futility, the self-contradiction, and the ridiculous absurdity of these suggestions, were properly exposed; nevertheless, the army was voted without any reduction. Sir Wilfred Lawson having made a motion for an ad∣dress
<PB N="550" REF="5530"/>
to the king, to know what satisfaction had been made by Spain for the depredations committed on the British merchants; it was after a violent debate approved<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the address presented. The king, in answer to this remonstrance, gave them to understand, that the meeting of the commissaries of the two crowns had been so long delayed by unforeseen accidents, that the conferences were not opened <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill the latter end of the preceding February; and, that as the courts of London and Madrid had agreed, that the term of three years stipulated for fin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ing the commission, should be computed from their first meeting, a perfect account of their proceedings could not as yet be layed before the hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of commons. A bill had been long depending for granting encouragement to the sugar colonies in the West-Indies; but, as it was founded upon a prohibition that would have put a stop to all commerce between the French islands and the British s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttlements in North America, it met with a very warm opposition from those who had the prosperity of those northern colonies at heart. But the bill being patronized and supported by the court interest, surmounted all objections; and afterwards passed into a law. While the commons deliberated upon the supply, Sir Robert Walpole moved, that five hundred thousand pounds should be issued out of the sinking fund for the service of the ensuing year. Sir Wil∣liam Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and Sir John Barnard, expatiated upon the iniquity of pillaging a sacred deposit, solemnly appropriated to the discharge of the national debt; and they might have demon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rated the egregious folly of a measure, by which the public, for a little temporary ease, lost the advantage of the accumulating intere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t which would have ari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en from the sinking fund it pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erly managed and reserved. All objections vanished before the powers of ministerial influence, which nothing now could check but the immediate dan∣ger of popular commotion. Such hazardous interposition actually defeated a scheme which had been adopted by the minister; and even before its appearance alarmed all the trading part of the nation.</P>

<P>The house having resolved itself into a committee, to deliberate upon the most proper methods for the better security and improvement of the duties and revenues charged upon tobacco and wines, all the papers relating to these duties were submitted to the perusal of the members; the commissioners of the customs and excise were ordered to attend the house, the avenues of which were crowded with multitudes of people; and the members in the opposition waited impatiently for a proposal, in which they thought the liberties of their country so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeply interested. In a word, there had been a call of the house on the pre∣ceding day. The session was frequent and full; and both sides appeared ready and eager for the contest, when Sir Robert Walpole broached his design. He <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook notice of the arts which had been used to prejudice the people against his plan before it was known. He affirmed, that the clamours occasioned by these prejudices had originally risen from smugglers and fraudulent dealers, who had enriched themselves by cheating the public; and, that these had been strenu∣ously assisted and supported by another set of men, fond of every opportunity to stir up the people of Great-Britain to mutiny and sedition. He expatiated on the frauds that were committed in that branch of the revenue arising from the duties on tobacco; upon the hardships to which the American plant∣ers were subjected by the heavy duties payable on importation, as well as by the ill usage they had met with from their factors and correspondents in
<PB N="551" REF="5540"/>
England, who, from being their servants, were now become their masters<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> upon the injury done to the fair trader; and the loss sustained by the public with respect to the revenue. He asserted, that the scheme he was about to pro∣pose would remove all these inconveniencies, prevent numberless frauds, perju∣ries, and false entries, and add two or three hundred thousand pounds per annum to the public revenue. He entered into a long detail of frauds practised by the knavish dealer in those commodities: he recited the several acts of par∣liament that related to the duties on wine and tobacco. He declared he had no intention to promote a general excise: he endeavoured to obviate some ob∣jections that might be made to his plan, the nature of which he at length ex∣plained. He proposed to join the laws of excise to those of the customs: that the farther subsidy of three farthings per pound charged upon imported to∣bacco, should be still levied at the custom house, and payable to his maj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sty's civil-list, as heretofore: that then the tobacco should be lodged in wareho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, to be appointed for that purpose by the commissioner of the excise: that the keeper of each warehouse, appointed likewise by the commissioners, should h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve one<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lock and key, and the merchant-importer have another: and, that the to∣bacco should be thus secured until the merchant should find vent for it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> either by exportation or home consumption: that the part designed for exportation should be weighed at the custom-house, discharged of the three farthings per pound which had been payed at its first importation; and then exported with∣out further trouble: that the portion destined for home-consumption should, in presence of the warehouse-keeper, be delivered to the purchaser, upon his paying the inland duty of fourpence per pound weight to the proper o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cer appointed to receive it; by which means the merchant would be eased of the inconveni∣ence of paying the duty upon importation, or of granting bonds and finding sureties for the payment, before he had found a market for the commodity: that all penalties and forfeitures, so far as they formerly belonged to the crown, should for the future be applied to the use of the public: that appeals in this, as well as in all other cases relating to the excise, should be heard and determined by two or three of the judges to be named by his majesty, and in the country, by the judge of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ize upon the next circuit, who should hear and determine such appeals in the most summary manner, without the formality of proceed∣ings in courts of law or equity.</P>

<P>Such was the substance of the famous excise-scheme, in favour of which Sir Robert Walpole moved, that the duties and subsidies on tobacco, should from and after the twenty-fourth day of June cease and determine. The debate which ensued was managed and maintained by all the able speakers on both sides of the question. Sir Robert Walpole was answered by Mr. Perry, member for the city of London. Sir Paul Methuen joined in the opposition. Sir John Barnard, another representative of London, distinguished himself in the same cause. He was supported by Mr. Pult<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, Sir William Wyndham, and other patriots. The scheme was espoused by Sir Philip Yorke, appointed lord chief-justice of the king's bench, and ennobled in the course of the ensuing year. Sir Joseph Jekyl approved of the project, which was likewise strenuously defended b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lord Hervey, Sir Thomas Ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nson, Sir William Yo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Winnington, which last excelled all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emporan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nistry in talents and address.

the minister of having misrepresented the frauds, and made false calculations. With respect to the supposed hardships under which the planters were said to labour, they affirmed, that no planter had ever dreamed of complaining, until instigated by letters and applications from London: that this scheme, far from relieving the planters, would expose the factors to such grievous oppression, that they would not be able to continue the trade, consequently the planters would be intirely ruined; and after all, it would not prevent those frauds against which it was said tobe provided: that from the examination of the commissioners of the customs, it appeared that those frauds did not exceed forty thousand pounds per annum, and might in a great measure be abolished by a due execu∣tion of the laws in being; consequently this scheme was unnecessary, would be ineffectual in augmenting the revenue, destructive to trade, and dangerous to the liberties of the subject, as it tended to promote a general excise, which was in all countries considered as a grievous oppression. They suggested, that it would produce an additional swarm of excise-officers and warehouse-keepers, appointed and payed by the treasury, so as to multiply the dependents on the crown, and enable it still farther to influence the freedom of elections: that the traders would become slaves to excise-men and warehouse-keepers, as they would be debarred all access to their commodities, except at certain hours, when attended by those officers: that the merchant, for every quantity of tobacco he could sell, would be obliged to make a journey, or send a messenger to the office for a permit, which could not be obtained without trouble, expence, and delay: and, that should a law be enacted in consequence of this motion, it would in all probability be some time or other used as a precedent for introducing excise laws into every branch of the revenue; in which case the liberty of Great-Britain would be no more. In the course of this debate, Sir Robert Walpole took notice of the multitudes which had beset all the approaches to the house. He said, it would be an easy task for a designing seditious person to raise a tumult and disorder among them: that gentlemen might give them what name they should think fit, and affirm they were come as humble suppli∣ants; but, he knew whom the law called sturdy beggars: and those who brought them to that place, could not be certain but that they might behave in the same manner. This insinuation was resented by Sir John Barnard, who ob∣served, that merchants of character had a right to come down to the court of requests, and lobby of the house of commons, in order to sollicit their friends and acquaintance against any scheme or project which they might think preju∣dicial to their commerce: that when he came into the house, he saw none but such as deserved the appellation of sturdy beggars as little as the honourable<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>33.</NOTE> gentleman himself, or any gentleman whatever. After a warm dispute the mo∣tion was carried by a majority of sixty-one voices. Several resolutions were founded on the proposal; and to these the house agreed, though not without another violent contest. The resolutions produced a bill, against which peti∣tions were preferred by the lord-mayor, aldermen, and common-council of Lon∣don, the cities of Coventry and Nottingham. A motion was made that counsel should be heard for the city of London; but it was rejected by the majority, and the petitions were ordered to lie upon the table. Had the minister en∣countered no opposition but that which appeared within doors, his project would have certainly been carried into execution; but the whole nation was alarmed, and
<PB N="553" REF="5560"/>
clamoured loudly against the excise-bill. The populace still crowded around Westminster-hall, blocking up all the avenues to the house of commons. They even insulted the persons of those members who had voted for the ministry on this occasion; and Sir Robert Walpole began to be in fear of his life. He therefore thought proper to drop the design, by moving, that the second reading of the bill might be postponed till the twelfth day of June. Then complaint being made of the insolence of the populace, who had maltreated several mem∣bers, divers resolutions were taken against those tumultuous crowds and their abettors; and these resolves were communicated to the lord-mayor of London, the sheriff of Middlesex, and the high-bailiff of Westminster. Some individuals were apprehended in the court of requests, as having fomented the disturbances; but they were soon released. The miscarriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in London and Westminster; and the minister was burned in effigie by the populace. After the miscarriage of the excise-scheme, the house unanimously resolved to inquire into the frauds and abuses in the customs; and a committee of twenty-one persons was chosen by ballot for this purpose.</P>

<P>The subsequent debates of this session were occasioned by a bill to prevent the infamous practice of stockjobbing, which with great difficulty made its way to the house of lords, who made some amendments, in conse∣quence of which it was layed aside; and, by another bill establishing a lot∣tery, to raise five hundred thousand pounds for the relief of those who had suffered by the charitable corporation. After having undergone some altera∣tions, it passed through both houses, and obtained the royal assent. The king, by a message to parliament, had signified his intention to give the princess-royal in marriage to the prince of Orange, promising himself their concurrence and assistance, that he might be enabled to bestow such a portion with his eldest daughter, as should be suitable to the occasion. The commons immediately resolved, that out of the monies arising from the sale of lands in the island of St. Christopher's, his majesty should be empowered to apply fourscore thou∣sand pounds as a marriage-dower for his daughter; and a clause for this pur∣pose was inserted in the bill, for enabling his majesty to apply five hundred thousand pounds out of the sinking-fund for the service of the current year.</P>

<P>The opposition in the house of lords was still more animated, though ineffectual. The debates chiefly turned upon the pension-bill, and the num∣ber of land-forces, on a motion made by lord Bathurst, for an account of the produce of the forfeited estates, which had belonged to the directors of the South-sea company. The trustees for these estates had charged themselves with a great sum of money; and the lords in the opposition thought they had a right to know how it had been disposed. The ministry had reasons to stifle this inquiry; and therefore opposed it with all their vigour. Nevertheless, the motion was carried, after a warm dispute, and the directors of the South-sea company were ordered to lay the account before the house. From this it appeared, that the large sums of money arising from the forfeited estates, had been distributed among the proprietors by way of dividend, even before re∣course was had to parliament for directions in what manner that produce should be applied: lord Bathurst therefore moved for a resolution of the house, that the disposal of this money by way of dividend, without any order or direction of a general court for that purpose, was a violation of the act of parliament
<PB N="554" REF="5570"/>
made for the disposal thereof, and a manifest in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice done to the proprietors of that stock. The d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke of N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astle, in order to gain time, moved, that as the account was confused and almost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the present directors of the company might be ordered to lay before the house a further and more <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> of the manner in which the money had been disposed. A violent contest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, in the course of which the house divided, and of fifty-seven peers who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted for the delay, forty-six were such as enjoyed pre∣ferment in the church<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commissions in the army, or civil employments under the government. At length lord Bathurst waved his motion for that time: then the house ordered, that the present and former directors of the South-sea company, together with the late inspectors of their accounts, should attend and be examined. They were accordingly interrogated, and gave so little sa∣tisfaction, that lord Bathurst moved for a committee of inquiry; but the question being put<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was carried in the negative: yet a very strong protest was entered by the lords in the opposition. The next subject of altercation was the bill for misapplying part of the produce of the sinking-fund. It was at∣tacked with all the force of argument, wit, and declamation, by the earl of Strafford, the lords Bathurst and Carteret, and the earl of Chesterfield, who had by this time resigned his staff of lord-steward of the houshold, and re∣nounced all connection with the ministry. Lord Bathurst moved for a reso∣lution, importing, that, in the opinion of the house, the sinking-fund ought for the future to be applied, in time of peace and public tranquillity, to the redemp∣tion of those taxes which were most prejudicial to the trade, most burthensome on the manufacture, and most oppressive on the poor of the nation. This mo∣tion was over-ruled, and the bill adopted by the majority. On the eleventh day of June, the king gave the royal assent to the bills that were prepared, and closed the session with a speech, in which he took notice of the wicked endeavours that had been lately used to inflame the minds of the people, by the most unjust misrepresentations.</P>

<P>Europe was now reinvolved in fresh troubles, by a vacancy on the throne of Poland. August<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> died at Warsaw in the end of January, and the neighbouring powers were immediately in commotion. The elector of Saxony son to the late king, and Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>slaus whose daughter was married to the French monarch, declared themselves candidates for the Polish throne. The emperor, the czarina, and the king of Prussia, espoused the interests of the Saxon; the king of France supported the pretensions of his father-in-law. The foreign ministers at Warsaw forthwith began to form intrigues among the electors; and the marquis de Monti, ambassador from France, exerted himself so suc∣cessfully, that he soon gained over the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imate, and a majority of the catholic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the interests of Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>laus; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e the Imperial and Russian troops hovered on the frontiers of Poland. The French king no sooner understood that a body of the emperor's forces was encamped in S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>sia, than he ordered the duke of Berwick to assemble an army on the Rhine, and take measures for entering Germany, in case the Imperia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ts should march into Poland. A French <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet set sail for Dantzick, while Stan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>laus trave<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led through Ger∣many in d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e to Poland, and concealed h ms<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f in the house of the French ambassador at Warsaw. As the day of election approached, the Imperial, Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>an, and Prussian ministers, delivered in their several declarations, by way
<PB N="555" REF="5580"/>
of protest against the contingent election of Stanislaus, as a person proscribed, disqualified, depending upon a foreign power, and connected with the Turks and other infidels. The Russian general Lasci entered Poland at the head of fifty thousand men: the diet of the election was opened with the usual cere∣mony on the twenty-fifth day of August: prince Viesazowiski chief of the Saxon interest, retired to the other side of the Vistula, with three thousand men, including some of the nobility who adhered to that party. Neverthe∣less, the primate proceeded to the election: Stanislaus was unanimously chosen king; and appeared in the electoral field, where he was received with loud acclamation. The opposite party soon increased to ten thousand men; pro∣tested against the election, and joined the Russian army, which advanced by speedy marches. King Stanislaus finding himself unable to cope with such ad∣versaries, retired with the primate and French ambassador to Dantzick, leav∣ing the palatine of Kiow at Warsaw. This general attacked the Saxon palace, which was surrendered upon terms: then the soldiers and inhabitants plundered the houses belonging to the grandees who had declared for Augustus, as well as the hotel of the Russian minister. In the mean time, the Poles who had joined the Muscovites, finding it impracticable to pass the Vistula before the expiration of the time fixed for the session of the diet, erected a kolo at Gro∣cow, where the elector of Saxony was chosen and proclaimed by the bishop of Cracow, king of Poland, under the name of Augustus III. on the sixth day of October. They afterwards passed the river, and the palatine of Kiow re∣tiring towards Cracow, they took possession of Warsaw, where in their turn they plundered the palaces and houses belonging to the opposite party.</P>

<P>During these transactions, the French king concluded a treaty with Spain and Sardinia, by which these powers agreed to declare war against the emperor. Manifestos were published reciprocally by all the contracting powers. The duke of Berwick passed the Rhine in October, and undertook the siege of sort Kehl, which in a few days was surrendered on capitulation: then he repassed the river, and returned to Versailles. The king of Sardinia having declared war against the emperor, joined a body of French forces commanded by marechal de Villars, and drove the Imperialists out of the Milanese. His Imperial majesty dreading the effects of such a powerful confederacy against him, offered to compromise all differences with the crown of Spain, under the mediation of the king of Great-Britain; and Mr. Keene, the British minister at Madrid, proposed an accommodation. Philip expressed his acknowledgments to the king of England, declaring, however, that the emperor's advances were too late; and that his own resolutions were already taken. Nevertheless, he sent orders to the count de Montijo, his ambassador at London, to commu∣nicate to his Britannic majesty the motives which had induced him to take these resolutions. In the mean time, he detached a powerful armament to Italy, where they invested the Imperial fortress of Aula, the garrison of which was obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war. The republic of Venice declared she would take no share in the disputes of Italy: the states-general signed a neutrality with the French king, for the Austrian Netherlands, without consulting the emperor or the king of Great-Britain; and the English councils seemed to be altogether pacific.</P>

Mr. H. Walpole took occasion to say, that the opposition treated the ministry as he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>f was treated by some of his acquaintance, with respect to his dress. <Q>“If I am in plain cloaths (said he) then they call me a slovenly dirty fellow; and if by chance I wear a laced suit, they cry, What, shall such an aukward f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ine cloaths?”</Q> He continued to sport in this kind of idle bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oonery. He compared the present administration to a ship at sea. As long as the wind was fair, and proper for carrying us to our designed port, the word was "Steady! steady;" but when the wind began to shift and change, the word was necessarily altered to "Thus, thus, and no near." The motion was overpowered by the majority; and this was the fate of se∣veral other proposals made by the members in the opposition. Sir John Bar∣nard presented a petition from the druggists, and other dealers in tea, com∣plaining of the insults and oppression to which they were subjected by the excise laws, and imploring relief. Sir John and Mr. Perry, another of the city∣members, explained the grievous hardships which those traders sustained, and moved that the petition might be referred to the consideration of the whole house. They were opposed by Mr. Winnington, Sir W. Yonge, and other partisans of the ministry; and these skirmishes brought on a general engage∣ment of the two parties, in which every weapon of satire, argument, reason, and truth, was weilded against that odious, arbitrary, and oppressive method of collecting the public revenue. Nevertheless, the motion in favour of the sufferers was rejected.</P>

<P>When the commons deliberated upon the supply, Mr. Andrews, deputy-paymaster of the army, moved for an addition of eighteen hundred men to the number of land forces which had been continued since the preceding year. The members in the opposition disputed this small augmentation with too much heat and eagerness. It must be acknowledged, they were by this time irritated into such personal animosity against the minister, that they re∣solved to oppose all his measures, whether they might or might not be ne∣cessary for the safety and advantage of the kingdom. Nor indeed were they altogether blameable for acting on this maxim, if their sole aim was to re∣move from the confidence and counsels of their sovereign, a man whose con∣duct they thought prejudicial to the interest and liberties of their country. They could not, however, prevent the augmentation proposed: but they resolved, if they could not wholly stop the career of the ministry, to throw in such a number of rubs as should at least retard their progress. The duke of Bolton and lord Cobham had been deprived of the regiments they commanded, be∣cause they refused to concur in every project of the administration. It was in consequence of their dismission that lord Morpeth moved for a bill to prevent any commission<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>officer, not above the rank of a colonel, from being removed, unless by a court-martial, or by address of either house of parliament. Such

<P>But the subject which of all others employed the eloquence and abilities on both sides to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> vigor us ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtion, was a motion made by Mr. Bromley, who proposed that a bill should be brought in for repealing the septennia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> act, and for the more frequent meeting and calling of parlia∣ments. The arguments for and against sept<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnial parliaments have already been stated. The ministry no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insisted upon the increase of papists and ja∣cobites, which rendered it dangerous to weake<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the hands of the government: they challenged the opposition to produce one instance in which the least in∣cr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>achment had been made on the liberties of the people, si<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce the septennial aft took place; and they defied the most ingenious malice to prove that his present majesty had ever endeavoured to extend any branch of the prerogative beyond its legal bounds. Sir John Hynde Cotton affirmed, that in many parts of England the papists had already begun to use all their influence in favour of those candidates who were recommended by the ministers as mem∣bers in the ensuing parliament. With respect to his majesty's conduct, he said he would not answer one word: but as to the gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s introduced since the law was enacted for septennial parliaments, he thought himself more at liberty to declare his sentiments. He asserted, that the septenn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al law itself was an en∣croachment on the rights of the people: a law passed by a parliament that made itself septennial. He observed, that the laws of treason with regard to trials were altered since that period: that in former times a man was tried by a jury of his neighbours, within the country where the crimes alledged against him were said to be committed; but by an act of a septennial parliament he might be removed and tried in any place where the crown, or rather the mi∣nistry,
<PB N="559" REF="5620"/>
could find a jury proper for their purpose; where the prisoner could not bring any witness in his justification, without an expence which perhaps his circumstances would not bear. He asked if the riot act was not an in∣croachment on the rights of the people? An act by which a little dirty justice of the peace, the meanest and vilest tool a minister can use, who perhaps sub∣sists by his being in the commission, and may be deprived of that subsistence at the pleasure of his patron, had it in his power to put twenty or thirty of the best subjects in England to immediate death, without any trial or form but that of reading a proclamation. <Q>“Was not the fatal South-sea scheme (said he) established by the act of a septennial parliament? And can any man ask, whether that law was attended with any inconvenience? To the glorious catalogue I might have added the late excise-bill, if it had passed into a law; but, thank heaven, the septennial parliament was near expiting before that famous measure was introduced.”</Q></P>

<P>Sir William Wyndham concluded an excellent speech, that spoke him the unrivalled orator, the uncorrupted Briton, and the unshaken patriot, in words to this effect. <Q>“Let us suppose a man abandoned to all notions of virtue and honour, of no great family, and but a mean fortune, rais<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to be chief minister of state, by the concurrence of many whimsical events; afraid, or unwilling to trust any but creatures of his own making, lost to all sense of shame and reputation; ignorant of his country's true interest, pur∣suing no aim but that of aggrandizing himself and his favourites; in fo∣reign affairs, trusting none but those who from the nature of their education, cannot possibly be qualified for the service of their country, or give weight and credit to their negotiations. Let us suppose the true interest of the na∣tion, by such means, neglected or misunderstood, her honour tarnished, her importance lost, her trade insulted, her merchants plundered, and her sailors murdered; and all these circumstances overlooked, lest his administration should be endangered. Suppose him next possessed of immense wealth, the plunder of the nation, with a parliament chiefly composed of members whose seats are purchased, and whose votes are bought at the expence of the public treasure. In such a parliament, suppose all attempts made to inquire into his conduct, or to relieve the nation from the distress which has been in∣tailed upon it by his administration. Suppose him screened by a corrupt majority of his creatures, whom he retains in daily pay, or engages in his particular interest, by distributing among them those posts and places which ought never to be bestowed upon any but for the good of the public. Let him plume himself upon his scandalous victory, because he has obtained a parliament like a packed jury ready to acquit him at all adventures. Let us suppose him domineering with insolence over all the men of antient fa∣milies, over all the men of sense, figure, or fortune, in the nation: as he has no virtue of his own, ridiculing it in others, and endeavouring to de∣stroy or corrupt it in all. With such a minister, and such a parliament, let us suppose a case which I hope will never happen: a prince upon the throne uninformed, ignorant, and unacquainted with the inclinations and true in∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest of his people, weak, capricious, transported with unbounded ambi∣tion, and possessed with insatiable avarice. I hope such a case will never oc∣cur; but, as it possibly may, could any greater curse happon to a nation,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 line" DISP="〈1 line〉"/></NOTE> The triumph of the ministry was still more complete in the success of a message delivered from the crown, in the latter end of the session, when a great many members of the other party had retired to their respective habi∣tations in the country. Sir Robert Walpole delivered this commission to the house, importing, that his majesty might be enabled to augment his forces, if occasion should require such an augmentation, between the dissolution of this parliament and the election of another. Such an important point, that was said to strike at the foundation of our liberties, was not tamely yielded; but, on the contrary, contested with uncommon ardour. The motion for taking the message into consideration was carried in the affirmative; and an address presented to the king, signifying their compliance with his desire. In consequence of a subsequent message, they prepared and passed a bill enabling his majesty to settle an annuity of five thousand pounds for life on the princess-royal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a mark of his paternal favour and affection.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The opposition in the house of peers kept pace with that in the house of commons, and was supported with equal abilities, under the auspices of the lords Bathurst and Carteret, the earls of Chesterland and Abingdon. The duke of Marlborough made a motion for a bill to regulate the army, equivalent to that which had been rejected in the lower house; and it met with the same fate, after a warm dispute. Then the lord Carteret moved for an address to the king, that he would be graciously pleased to acquaint the house who advised his majesty to remove the duke of Bolton and the lord vis∣count Cobham from their respective regiments; and what crimes were laid to their charge. This proposal was likewise rejected, at the end of a debate in which the duke of Argyle observed, that two lords had been removed, but only one soldier had lost his commission. Such a great majority of the Scottish representatives had always voted for the ministry since the accession of the late king; and so many of these enjoyed places and preferments in the gift of the crown, that several attempts were made by the lords in the opposition, to pre∣vent for the future the ministerial influence from extending itself to the elections of North-Britain. Accordingly, two motions for this purpose were made by the earl of Marchmont, and duke of Bedford; and sustained by the earls of Chesterfield, Winchel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, and Stair, the lords Willoughby de Broke, Bathurst, and Carteret. They were opposed by the dukes of Newcastle and Argyle, the earl of Cholmon∣dely, earl Poulet, lord Hervey, now called up by writ to the house of peers, and lord Talbot. The question being put in both, they were of course defeated; and the earl of Stair was deprived of his regiment of dragoons, after having performed the most signal services to the royal family, and exhausted his
<PB N="561" REF="5640"/>
fortune in supporting the interests and dignity of the crown. Strenuous protests were entered against the decision of the majority, concerning the king's message demanding a power to augment his forces during the recess of parlia∣ment; as also against a bill for enabling his majesty to apply the sum of one million two hundred thousand pounds out of the sinking-fund, for the service of the current year. The business of the session being dispatched, the king r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>paired to the house of lords on the sixteenth day of April, and having passed all the bills that were ready for the royal assent, took leave of this parliament, with the wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mest acknowledgment of their zeal, duty, and affection. It was at first prorogued, then dissolved, and another convoked by the same pro∣clamation. On the fourteenth day of March, the nuptials of the prince of Orange and the princess royal were solemnized with great magnificence; and this match was attended with addresses of congratulation to his majesty from different parts of the kingdom.</P>

<P>The powers at war upon the continent acted with surprising vi∣gour. The Russian and Saxon army invested the city of Dantzick, in hope of securing the person of king Stanislaus. The town was strong, the garrison numerous; and animated by the examples of the French and Poles, made a very obstinate defence. For some time they were supplied by sea with recruits, arms, and, ammunition. On the eleventh day of May, a reinforcement of fifteen hundred men was landed from two French ships of war and some tran∣sports, under Fort Wechselmunde, which was so much in want of provisions, that they were not admitted: they therefore reimbarked, and sailed back to Copenhagen. But afterwards a larger number were landed in the same place, and attacked the Russian intrenchments, in order to force their way into the city. They were repulsed in this attempt, but retired in good order. At length the Russian fleet arrived under the command of admiral Gordon; and now the siege was carried on with great fury. Fort Wechselmunde was sur∣rendered: the French troops capitulated, and were embarked in the Russian ships, to be conveyed to some port in the Baltic. Stanislaus escaped in the dis∣guise of a peasant to Marienwarder in the Prussian territories. The city of Dantzick submitted to the dominion of Augustus III. king of Poland, and was obliged to defray the expence of the war to the Russian general count de Munich, who had assumed the command after the siege was begun. The Polish lords at Dantzick signed an act of submission to king Augustus, who, on the tenth day of July, arrived at the convent of Oliva. There a council was held in his presence. The recusant noblemen took the oath which he pro∣posed. Then a general amnesty was proclaimed; and the king set out on his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturn to Dresden.</P>

<P>On the Rhine the French arms bore down all resistance. The count de Belleisle besieged and took Traerbach. The duke of Berwick, at the head of sixty thousand men, invested Philipsburg, while prince Eugene was obliged to remain on the defensive, in the strong camp at Heilbron, wait∣ing for the troops of the empire. On the twelfth day of June, the duke of Berwick, in visiting the trenches, was killed by a cannon-ball, and the com∣mand devolved upon the marquis d'Asfeldt, who carried on the operations of the siege with equal vigour and capacity. Prince Eugene being joined by the different reinforcements he expected, marched towards the French lines; but
<PB N="562" REF="5650"/>
found them so strong that he would not hazard an attack; and such precau∣tions taken, that with all his military talents he could not relieve the besieged. At length general Watgen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the governor capitulated, after having made a no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e defence, and obtained the most honourable conditions. Prince Eugene retired to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the campaign ended about the beginning of Octo∣ber. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arms were not more successful in Italy. The infant Don Carlos had received so many invitations from the Neapolitan nobility, that he resolved to take possession of that kingdom. He began his march in F e∣bruary, at the head of the Spanish forces; published a manifesto, declaring he was sent by his father to relieve the kingdom of Naples from the oppression under which it groaned, and entered the capital amidst the acclamations of the people: while the count de Viscomti the German viceroy, finding himself unable to cope with the invaders thought proper to retire, after having thrown succours into Ga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a and Capua. When he arrived at Nocera, he began to assemble the militia, with intent to form a camp at Barletta. The count de Montemar marched with a body of forces against this general, and obtained over him a complete victory at Bitonto in Apuglia, on the twenty-fifth of May, when the Imperialists were entirely routed, and a great number of principal officers taken prisoners. Don Carlos being proclaimed and ac∣knowledged king of Naples, created the count de Montemar duke of Bitonto; reduced Gaeta, and all other parts of the kingdom which were garrisoned with Imperial troops, and resolved to subdue the island of Sicily. About twenty thousand troops being destined for this expedition, were landed in the road of Solanto in August, under the command of the new duke of Bitonto, who being favoured by the natives, proceeded in his conquests with great ra∣pidity. The people acknowledged Don Carlos as their sovereign, and took arms in support of his government; so that the Imperial troops were driven before them, and the Spaniards possessed the whole kingdom, except Messina, Syracuse, and Trepani, when the infant determined to visit the island in person.</P>

<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>While Don Carlos was thus employed in the conquest of Naples and Sicily, the Imperialists were hard pressed in Lombardy by the united forces of France and Piedmont, commanded by the king of Sardinia and the old marechal duke de Villars. In the month of January they undertook the siege of Tortona, which they reduced; while the troops of the emperor began to pour in great numbers into the Mantuan. In the beginning of May, count Merci, who commanded them, passed the Po in the face of the allies, not∣withstanding all the skill of Villars, obliged him to retreat from the banks of that river, and took the castle of Colorno. The old French general being taken ill, quitted the army and retired to Turin, where in a little time he died; and the king of Sardinia repairing to the same place, the command of the allied forces devolved upon the marechal de Coigny. The confederates were posted at Sanguina, and the Imperialists at Sorbela, when the count de Merci made a motion to San Prospero, as if he intended either to attack the enemy, or take possession of Parma. The marechal de Coigny forthwith made a disposition for an engagement; and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the Imperial general having passed the Parma, began the attack with great impetuosity. He charged in person at the head of his troops, and was killed
<PB N="563" REF="5660"/>
soon after the battle began. Nevertheless, the prince of Wirtemberg assuming the command, both armies fought with great obstinacy, from eleven in the forenoon till four in the afternoon, when the Imperialists retired towards Monte Cirugalo, leaving five thousand men dead on the field of battle, and among these many officers of distinction. The loss of the allies was very consider∣able, and they reaped no solid fruits from their victory.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>The Imperial forces retreated to Reggio, and from thence moved to the plains of Carpi, on the right of the Secchia, where they received some reinforcements; then general count Konigsegg arriving in the camp, took upon himself the command of the army. His first step was to take post at Quingentolo, by which motion he secured Mirandola, that was threatened with a siege. On the fifteenth of February, he forded the river Secchia, and surprised the quarters of marechal de Broglio, who escaped in his shirt with great difficulty. The French retired with such precipitation, that they left all their baggage behind, and above two thousand were taken prisoners. They posted themselves under Guastalla, where, on the nineteenth day of the month, they were vigorously attacked by the Imperialists, and a general engagement ensued. Konigsegg made several desperate efforts to break the French cavalry, upon which, however, he could make no impression. The infantry on both sides fought with uncommon ardour for six hours, and the field was covered with carnage. At length the Imperial general retreated to Lazara, after having lost above five thousand men, including the prince of Wirtemberg, the generals Valpareze and Colminero, with many other officers of distinction: nor was the damage sustained by the French greatly inferior to that of the Germans, who repassed the Po and took post on the banks of the Oglio. The allies crossed the same river, and the marquis de Maillebois was sent with a de∣tachment to attack Mirandola; but the Imperialists marching to the relief of the place, compelled him to abandon the enterprize: then he rejoined his army, which retired under the walls of Cremona, to wait for succours from Don Carlos. So little respect did the French court pay to the British nation, at this juncture, that in the month of November an edict was published in Paris, commanding all the British subjects in France, who were not actually in employment, from the age of eighteen to fifty, to quit the kingdom in fifteen days, or inlist in some of the Irish regiments, on pain of being treated as vagabonds and sent to the gallies. This edict was executed with the ut∣most rigour. The prisons of Paris were crouded with the subjects of Great-Britain, who were surprised and cut off from all communication with their friends, and must have perished by cold and hunger, had not they been re∣lieved by the active charity of the Jansenists. The earl of Waldegrave, who then resided at Paris as ambassador from the king of Great-Britain, made such vigorous remonstrances to the French ministry, upon this unheard-of out∣rage, against a nation with they had been so long in alliance, that they thought proper to set the prisoners at liberty, and publish another edict, by which the meaning of the former was explained away.</P>

<P>While these transactions occurred on the continent, the king of Great-Britain augmented his land-forces; and warm contests were maintained through the whole united kingdom in electing representatives for the new par∣liament. But in all these struggles the ministerial power predominated; and

the new members appeared with the old complexion. The two houses assembled on the fourteenth day of January, and Mr. Onslow was re elected as speaker. The leaders of both parties in all debates were the self same p rsons who had cond<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted these of the former parliament; and the same measures were persued in the same manner.

He told them he had used the power vested in him by the last parliament with great <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and con∣cluded a treaty with the crown of Denmark of great importance in the present conjuncture. He observed, that whilst many of the principal powers of Europe were actually engaged in a war, Great-Britain must be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of less <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the consequences; and as the best concerted measures are li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to uncer∣tainty, the nation ought to be prepared against all events. He therefore ex∣pressed his hope, that his good subjects would not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the necessary means of procuring the blessings of peace and universal tr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>q<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>llity, or of putting him in a condition to act that part which it might be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and incumbent upon him to take. The address of thanks produced a dispute as usual, which ended with an acquiescence in the motion. The house, in a grand committee on the supply, resolved, That thirty thousand men should be employed for the service of the ensuing years and, That the land-forces should be augmented to the number of twenty-five thousand seven hundred and forty-four effective men. But these resolutions were not taken without dispute and division. The mi∣nister's opponents not only reproduced all the reasons which had been formerly advanced against a standing army, but they opposed this augmentation with ex∣traordinary ardour, as a huge stride towards the establishment of orbitary power.

supported by Sir Joseph Jekyll and Mr. Pulteney; but after some debate the motion was carried in the negative. When the new treaty with Denmark fell under consideration in a grand committee, Mr. H. Walpole moved, that the sum of fifty-six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds should be granted to his majesty as a subsidy to the Dane, pursuant to the said treaty, for the service of the ensuing year. The demand did not meet with immediate compliance. All the leaders in the opposition exclaimed against the subsidy as unnecessary and unreasonable. They observed, that as the English had no particular interest of their own for inducing them to engage in the present war, but only the danger to which the ballance of power might be exposed by that event; and as all the powers of Europe were as much, if not more interested than the English in the preservation of that ballance, should it ever be really endangered, they would certainly engage in its defence, without receiving any valuable conside∣ration from Great-Britain; but, should the English be always the first to take the alarm upon any rupture, and offer bribes and pensions to all the princes in Europe, the whole charge of preserving that ballance would fall upon Great-Britain: every state would expect a gratification from her, for doing that which it would otherwise be obliged to do for its own preservation: even the Dutch might at last refuse to assist in trimming this ballance, unless Britain should sub∣mit to make the grand pensionary of Holland a pensionary of England, and take a number of their forces into English pay. The debate having had its free course, the question was put, and the motion approved by the majority. The ministry allowed a bill to be brought in for limiting the number of officers in the house of commons; but, at the second reading it was rejected upon a divi∣sion, after a learned debate, in which it appeared, that the opposition had gained a valuable auxiliary in the person of lord Polwarth, son to the earl of Marchmont, a nobleman of elegant parts, keen penetration, and uncommon vivacity, who spoke with all the fluency and fervour of elocution.</P>

<P>The minority in the house of lords were not less vigilant and resolute in detecting and opposing every measure which they thought would redound to the prejudice of their country. But the most remarkable objectthat employed their at∣tention during this session was a very extraordinary petition, subscribed by the dukes of Hamilton, Queensberry, and Montrose, the earls of Dundonald, Marchmont, and Stair, representing, that undue influence had been used in carrying on the election of the sixteen peers for Scotland. The duke of Bedford, who delivered their petition to the house, proposed a day for taking it into consideration; and to this they agreed. It was afterwards moved, that the consideration of it should be adjourned to a short day, before which the petitioners should be or∣dered to declare whether they intended to controvert the last election of all the sixteen peers, or the election of any, and which of them. This affair was of such an unprecedented nature, that the house seemed to be divided in opinion about the manner in which they ought to proceed. The partisans of the mi∣n stry would have willingly stilled the inquiry in the beginning; but, the peti∣tioners were so strenuously supported in their claim to some notice, by the earls of Chesterfield, Abingdon, and Strafford, the lords Bathurst and Carteret, that they could not dismiss it at once with any regard to decorum. The order of the house, according to the motion explained above, being communicated by the lord∣chancellor to the petitioners, they waited on him with a declaration, importing,
<PB N="566" REF="5690"/>
that they did not intend to controvert the election or return of the sixteen peers for Scotland; but, they thought it their duty to lay before their lordships the evidence of such facts and undue methods, as appeared to them to be danger∣ous to the constitution; and might in future elections equally affect the right of the present sixteen peers, as that of the other peers of Scotland, if not prevented by a proper remedy. This declaration being repeated to the house, the duke of Devonshire made a motion, that the petitioners might be ordered to lay before the house in writing, instances of those undue methods and illegal practices upon which they intended to proceed, and the names of the persons they suspected to be guilty. He was warmly opposed by the country party; and a long debate ensued, after which the question was carried in favour of the motion, and the order signified to the petitioners. Next day their answer was read to the house to this effect: That as they had no intention to state them∣selves accusers, they could not take upon them to name particular persons who might have been concerned in those illegal practices; but who they were would undoubtedly appear to their lordships upon their taking the proper examinations: nevertheless, they did humbly acquaint their lordships, that the petition was layed before them upon information that the list of the sixteen peers for Scot∣land had been framed previous to the elections by persons in high trust under the crown: that this list was shewn to peers as a list approved by the crown; and was called the King's-list, from which there was to be no variation, unless to make way for one or two particular peers, on condition they should conform to measures: that peers were sollicited to vote for this list, without the liberty of making any alteration: that endeavours were used to engage peers to vote for this list by promise of pensions, and offices civil and military to themselves and relations, as well as by offers of money: that sums were given for this purpose: that pensions, offices, and releases of debts owing to the crown, were actually granted to peers who concurred in voting for this list, and to their relations: and, that on the day of election a battalion of his majesty's troops was drawn up in the abbey-court of Edinburgh, contrary to custom, and without any apparent cause but that of overawing the electors. This answer gave rise to another violent dispute; but the majority voted it unsatisfactory, and the petition was rejected, though the resolution was clogged with a vigorous protest.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Ch. 1735.</NOTE> Notwithstanding this discouragement, the earl of Abingdon moved, That although the petition was dismissed, an inquiry might be set on foot touch∣ing an affair of such consequence to the liberties of the kingdom. The earl of Ilay declaring his belief, that no such illegal methods had been practised, the other produced a pamphlet, intituled, The protests of a great number of noble lords, entered by them at the last election of peers for Scotland. Exceptions being taken to a pamphlet, as an object unworthy of their notice, lord Bathurst exhibited an authentic copy of those protests, extracted from the journal of that election, signed by the two principal clerks, and witnessed by two gentlemen then attending in the lobby. These were accordingly read, and plainly demon∣strated the truth of the allegations contained in the petition. Nothing could be more scandalous, arrogant, and shamefully flagrant than the conduct and de∣portment of those who acted the part of understrappers to the ministry on this occasion. But all this demonstration, adorned and enforced by the charms and energy of eloquence, was like preaching in a desart. A motion was made for
<PB N="567" REF="5700"/>
adjourning, and carried in the affirmative: a protest was entered, and the whole affair consigned to oblivion. Divers other motions were made successively by the lords in the opposition, and rejected by the invincible power of a majority. The uninterrupted success of the ministry did not, however, prevent them from renewing the struggle as often as an opportunity offered. They dis∣puted the continuation of the salt-tax, and the bill for enabling the king to apply the sum of one million out of the sinking fund for the service of the current year, though success did not attend their endeavours. They sup∣ported with all their might a bill sent up from the commons, explaining and amending an act of the Scottish parliament, for preventing wrongous impri∣sonment, and against undue delays in trials. This was all the natives of Scot∣land had in lieu of the Habeas-corpus act; though it did not screen them from oppression. Yet the earl of Ilay undertook to prove they were on a footing with their neighbours of England in this respect; and the bill was thrown out on a division. The session was closed on the fifteenth of May, when the king in his speech to both houses, declared, that the plan of pacification concerted between him and the states-general had not produced the desired effect. He thanked the commons for the supplies they had granted with such chearfulness and dispatch. He signified his intention to visit his German dominions; and told them he should constitute the queen regent of the realm in his absence. Im∣mediately after the prorogation his majesty embarked for Holland in his way to Hanover.</P>

<P>By this time the good understanding between the courts of Ma∣drid and Lisbon was destroyed by a remarkable incident. The Portuguese ambas∣sador at Madrid, having allowed his domestics to rescue a criminal from the officers of justice, all the servants concerned in that rescue were dragged from his house to prison, by the Spanish king's order, with circumstances of rigour and disgrace. His Portuguese majesty being informed of this outrage, ordered reprisals to be made upon the servants of the Spanish ambassador at Lisbon. The two ministers withdrew abruptly to their respective courts. The two mo∣narchs expressed their mutual resentment. The king of Spain assembled a body of troops on the frontiers of Portugal; and his Portuguese majesty had recourse to the assistance of king George. Don Marcos Antonio d'Alzeveda was dis∣patched to London with the character of envoy extraordinary; and succeeded in his commission according to his wish. In a little time after the king's depar∣ture from England, Sir John Norris sailed from Spithead with a powerful squadron, in order to protect the Portuguese against the Spaniards; and on the ninth day of June arrived at Lisbon, where he was welcomed as a deliverer. Mr. Keene, the British envoy at the court of Spain, had communicated to his catholic majesty the resolution of his master to send a powerful squadron to Lisbon, with orders to guard that coast from insults, and secure the Brazil fleet, in which the merchants of Great-Britain were deeply interested. Don Joseph Patinho, minister of his catholic majesty, delivered a memorial to Mr. Keen, representing, that such an expedition would affect the commerce of Spain, by intimidating foreign merchants from embarking their merchandize in the flota. But, in all probability, it prevented a rupture between the two crowns, and disposed the king of Spain to listen to terms of accommodation.</P>

<P>The powers in alliance against the house of Austria having rejected the plan of pacification concerted by the king of Great-Britain and the states-general, Mr. Walpole ambassador at the Hague presented a memorial to their high mightenesses, desiring they would without less of time put themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a posture of defence, by an augmentation of their forces at sea and land, that they might take such vigorous steps, in concert with Great-Britain, as the future conjuncture of affairs might require. But, before they would subject them¦selves to such expence, they resolved to make further trial of their influence with the powers in alliance against the emperor; and conferences were renewed with the ministers of those allies. The affairs of Poland became more and more unfavourable to the interest of Stanislaus; for, though a great number of the Polish nobility engaged in a confederacy to support his claim, and made re∣peated efforts in his behalf, the palatine of Klow submitted to Augustus; and even his brother the primate, after having sustained a long imprisonment, and many extraordinary hardships, was obliged to acknowledge that prince his sove∣regn. In Italy the arms of the allies still continued to prosper. Don Carlos landed in Sicily, and reduced the whole island, almost without opposition; while the Imperialists were forced to abandon all the territories they possessed in Italy, except the Mantuan. The emperor being equally unable to cope with the French armies on the Rhine, implored succours of the czarina, who sent thirty thousand men to his assistance. This vigorous interposition, and the success of Augustus in Poland, disposed the court of Versailies to a pacifica∣tion. A secret negotiation was begun between France and the house of Austria; and the preliminaries were signed without the concurrence or knowledge of Spain, Sardinia, and the maritime powers. In these articles it was stipulated, That France should restore all the conquests she had made in Germany: That the reversion of the dukedom of Tuscany should be vested in the duke of Lorraine: That Lorraine should be allotted to king Stanislaus; and after his death, be united to the crown of France: That the emperor should possess the Milanese, the Mantuan, and Parma: That the king of Sardinia should enjoy Vigevano and Novara: That Don Carlos should be acknowledged king of Naples and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and retain the island of Elba, with all the Spanish territories on the coast of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uscany: and, That France should guaranty the pragmatic sanction.</P>

<P>The king of Great-Britain returned from Hanover to England in the month of November; and on the fifteenth day of January opened the session of parliament. On this occasion he congrtulated them on the near prospect of a general peace in Europe, in consequence of the preliminary arti∣cles to which the emperor and the king of France had agreed; and of which he had expressed his approbation, as they did not differ in any essential point from the plan of pacification which he and the states-general had offered to the belligerant powers. He told them that he had already ordered a considerable reduction to be made in his forces both by sea and land; but, at the same time observed, it would be necessary to continue some extraordinary expence until a more perfect reconciliation should be established among the several powers of Europe. An address of thanks was unanimously voted, presented, and graci∣ously received. After the house had received several petitions from different counties and gentlemen, complaining of undue influence in elections for mem∣bers
<PB N="569" REF="5720"/>
of parliament; it proceeded to consider of the supply, and Sir Charles Wager moving, that fifteen thousand seamen should be employed for the service of the ensuing year, the proposal was approved without opposition. But, this was not the case with a motion made by Mr. Pulteney, <Q>“That the ordinary esti∣mate of the navy should be referred to a select committee.”</Q> The ministry discouraged all such prying measures: a debate was produced, the house di∣vided, and the motion was rejected. Such was the fate of a motion for raising the supplies within the year, made by Mr. Sandys, and supported by Sir John Barnard, Mr. Willimot, and other patriots, who demonstrated, that this was a speedy and practicable expedient for discharging the national debt, lowering the interest of money, reducing the price of labour, and encouraging a spirit of commerce.</P>

<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The bill for limiting the number of officers in the house of com∣mons was again revived. The king was impowered to borrow six hundred thousand pounds, chargeable on the sinking fund for the service of the ensuing year; though this power was not easily granted; and the house resolved to lay a duty of twenty shillings per gallon on all spirituous liquors, after it had ap∣peared to the committee appointed for that purpose, that those spirits were per∣nicious to the health and morals of the people. To this resolution was added another, which amounted to a total prohibition, namely, that fifty pounds should be yearly payed to his majesty for a licence to be annually taken out by every person who should vend, barter, or utter any such spirituous liquors. Mr. Walter Plumer, in a well concerted speech, moved for the repeal of some clauses in the test-act: these he represented as a species of persecution, in which pro∣testant dissenters were confounded with the roman catholics and enemies to the establishment. He was sustained by lord Polwarth and Mr. Heathcote; but, Sir Robert Walpole was joined by Mr. Shippen against the motion as dangerous to the established church; and the question being put, it was carried in the ne∣gative. When Sir Joseph Jekyl presented to the house, according to order a<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1736.</NOTE> bill founded on the resolutions they had taken against spirituous liquors, Sir Ro∣bert Walpole acquainted them, by his majesty's command, that as the altera∣tions proposed to be made by that bill in the duties charged upon all spirituous liquors, might in a great degree affect some part of the civil-list revenues, his majesty, for the sake of remedying so great an evil as was intended by that bill to be prevented, did consent to accept any other revenue of equal value, to be settled and appropriated in lieu of his interest in the said duties. The bill was read a second time, and consigned to a committee of the whole house; but that for limiting the number of officers in the house of commons, was thrown out at the second reading. Petitions against the bill touching the retail of spirituous liquors were presented by the traders to the British sugar colonies, by the merchants of Bristol and Liverpool, representing the hardships to which they would be exposed by a law which amounted to a prohibition of rum and spirits distilled from molasses. In consequence of these remonstrances, a mitigating clause was inserted, in favour of the composition known by the name of punch; and distillers were permitted to exercise any other employment. The sum of seventy thousand pounds was voted for making good the deficiencies that might happen in the civil list by this bill, which at length passed through the house, though not without reiterated disputes and warm altercation. Violent opposition was
<PB N="570" REF="5730"/>
likewise made to a bill for the relief of the people called quakers, who offered a petition, representing, that though from motives of conscience they refused the payment of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ythes, church-rates, ob<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations, and ecclesiastical dues, they were exposed to g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>evous sufferings by prosecution in the exchequer, ecclesiastical, and other courts, to the imprisonment of their persons, and the ruin of them and their families. A bill being prepared for their relief, was read and printed: then pe∣titions were prefered against it by the clergy of Middlesex, and of many other parts of the kingdom. Counsel was heard in behalf of these petitioners, and several alterations proposed in the bill, which after long repeated debates sur∣mounted all opposition, and was sent up to the lords.</P>

<P>In the month of February the king had sent two members of the privy-council to the prince of Wales, with a message, proposing a marriage be∣tween his royal highness and the princess of Saxegotha. The proposal being agreeable to the prince, the marriage was celebrated on the twenty-seventh day of April. Upon this occasion Mr. Pulteney moved for an address of con∣gratulation to his majesty, and was supported by Mr. George Lyttleton and Mr. William Pitt, who seized this opportunity of pronouncing elegant pane∣gyrics on the prince of Wales and his amiable consort. These two young mem∣bers soon distinguished themselves in the house by their eloquence and superior talents. The attention of the house was afterwards converted to a bill for the prevention of smuggling; and another for explaining the act for the more ef∣fectual preventing bribery and corruption in the election of members to serve in parliament. Both made their way through the lower house, and were sent up to the lords for their concurrence. The number of land-forces voted for the service of the current year was reduced to seventeen thousand seven hundred and four effective men. The supplies were raised by the malt-tax and land-tax, at two shillings in the pound, additional duties on mum, cyder, and perry, stamped vellum, parchment, and paper; and by an act impowering his majesty to borrow six hundred thousand pounds of the sinking fund. In this session the parliament repealed the old statutes of England and Scotland against conjura∣ration, witchcraft, and dealing with evil spirits. The commons likewise pre∣pared a bill to restrain the disposition of lands in mortmain, whereby they be∣came unalienable. Against this measure petitions were presented by the two universities, the colleges of Eton, Winchester, and Westminster, and divers hospitals that subsisted by charitable donations. In favour of the universities and colleges a particular exempting clause was inserted. Several other amendments were made in the bill, which passed through both houses, and obtained the royal assent. Among the acts passed in this session, was one for naturalizing her royal highness the princess of Wales; and another for building a bridge cross the Thames from the New-palace Yard in the city of Westminster, to the oppo∣site shore in the county of Surry. The points chiefly debated in the house of lords were the address of thanks for his majesty's speech, the mortmain bill, the quakers bill, which was thrown out, and that for the prevention of smug∣gling, which did not pass without division and protest. On the twentieth <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay of May the king closed the session with a speech, in which he told both houses, that a farther convention touching the execution of the preliminaries had been made and communicated to him by the emperor and most christian king: and, that negotiations were carrying on by the several powers engaged in the
<PB N="571" REF="5740"/>
late war, in order to settle a general pacification. He expressed great concern at seeing such seeds of dissatisfaction sown among his people: he protested it was his desire, and should be his care, to preserve the present constitution in church and state as by law established: he recommended harmony and mutual affection among all protestants of the nation, as the great security of that happy esta∣blishment; and signified his intention to visit his German dominions. Accord∣ingly the parliament was no sooner prorogued than he set out for Hanover, after having appointed the queen regent in his absence.</P>

<P>Such a degree of licentiousness prevailed over the whole nation, that the kingdom was filled with tumult and riots, which might have been prevented by proper regulations of the civil government in a due execution of the laws. The most remarkable of these disturbances happened at Edinburgh on the seventh day of September. John Porteous, who commanded the guard payed by that city, a man of a brutal disposition and abandoned morals, had at the execution of a smuggler been provoked by some insults from the popu∣lace, to order his men, without using the previous formalities of the law, to fire with shot among the crowd; by which precipitate order several innocent per∣sons lost their lives. Porteous was tried for murder, convicted, and received sentence of death; but the queen, as guardian of the realm, thought proper to indulge him with a reprieve. The common people of Edinburgh resented this lenity shewn to a criminal who was the object of their detestation. They re∣membered that pardons had been granted to divers military delinquents in that country, who had been condemned by legal trial. They seemed to think those were encouragements to oppression; they were fired by a national jealousy; they were stimulated by the relations and friends of those who had been mur∣dered; and they resolved to wreak their vengeance on the author of that tra∣gedy, by depriving him of life on the very day which the judges had fixed for his execution. Thus determined, they assembled in different bodies, about ten of the clock at night. They blocked up the gates of the city, to prevent the admission of the troops that were quartered in the suburbs. They surprised and disarmed the town-guard: they broke open the prison doors, dragged Porteous from thence to the place of execution, and leaving him hanging by the neck on a dyer's pole, quietly dispersed to their several habitations. This exploit was performed with such conduct and deliberation as seemed to be the result of a plan formed by some persons of consequence: it therefore became the object of a very severe inquiry.</P>

<P>During this summer a rupture happened between the Turks and the Russians, which last reduced the city of Asoph on the Black-sea, and over∣ran the greatest part of Crim Tartary. The czarina declared war against the Ottoman Porte, because the Tartars of the Crimea had made incursions upon her frontiers; and when she complained of these dis<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rters to the vizir, she re∣ceived no satisfaction: besides, a large body of Tartars had, by order of that minister, marched through the Russian provinces, in despite of the empress, and committed terrible havoc in their route. The emperor was obliged to engage as a party in this war, by a treaty offensive and defensive, which he had many years before concluded with the czarina. Yet, before he declared himself, he joined the maritime powers in offering his mediation to the sultan, who was very well disposed to peace; but, the czarina insisted upon her retaining Asoph, which

Don Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>los was cro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned king of Sicily: Stanislaus abdicated the crown of Poland<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Augustus was universally acknowledged sovereign of that kingdom. The prelim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>naries were approved and accepted by the diet of the empire: the king of Spain sent ord<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs for his troops to evacuate Tuscany; and the pro∣vinces in Italy yielded to the house of Austria. Prince Eugene, who had ma∣naged the interests of the emperor on this occasion, did not live to see the happy fruits of his negotiation. He died at Vienna, in April, at the age of seventy-three, leaving behind him the character of an invincible hero and consummate politician. He was not long survived by count Staremberg, another Imperial general, who ranked next to the prince in military reputation. About the same time Great-Britain sustained a national loss in the death of lord chancellor Talbot, who by his worth, probity, and acquired accomplishments, had digni∣fied the great office to which he had been raised. He died universally lamented, in the month of February, at the age of fifty-two; and was succeeded on the bench by the lord Hardwicke.</P>

<P>The king being indisposed, in consequence of having been fatigued by a very tempestuous passag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Holland, the parliament was prorogued from the twenty-first day of January to the first of February, and then the session was opened by commission. The lord chancellor, as one of the peers authorised by this commission, made a speech in his majesty's name to both houses. With respect to foreign affairs, he told them, that the respective acts of cession being exchanged, and orders given for the evacuation and possession of the several countries and places by the powers concerned, according to the allot∣ment and disposition of the preliminary articles, the great work of re-establish∣ing the general tranquillity was far adva<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ced: that however, common prudence called upon them to be very attentive to the final conclusion of the new settlement. He sai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s majesty could not without surprize and concern, observe the many contrivances and attempts carried on, in various shapes, and in different parts of the nation, tumultuously to resist and obstruct the excution of the laws, and to violate the peace of the kingdom. That the consideration of the heighth to which these auda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious practices might rise, if not timely suppressed, afforded a melancholy prospect, and required particular attention, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t they should affect private persons in the quiet enjoyment of their property, as well as the general peace and good order of the whole.

majesty, that he would be pleased to settle one hundred thousand pounds a-year upon the prince of Wales. He represented that such provision was conforma∣ble to the practice of antient times: that what he proposed had been enjoyed by his present majesty in the life-time of his father: and, that a settlement of this nature was reasonable and necessary, to ascertain the independency of the ap∣parent heir to the crown. The motion was vigorously opposed by Sir Robert Walpole, as an encroachment on the prerogative; as an officious intermeddling in the king's family-affairs; and as an effort to set his majesty and the prince at variance. But a misunderstanding it seems had already happened in the royal family: for, the minister in the midst of his harangue told the house, by his majesty's command, that on the preceding day the king had sent a message to the prince by several noblemen of the first quality, importing, that his ma∣jesty had given order for settling a jointure upon the princess of Wales, suitable to her high rank and dignity, which he would in a proper time lay before the parliament, in order to be rendered more certain and effectual: that, although his royal highness had not thought fit by any application to his majesty, to de∣sire that his allowance of fifty thousand pounds might be rendered less preca∣rious, the king, to prevent the bad consequencees which he apprehended might follow from the undutiful measures which his majesty was informed the prince had been advised to pursue, would grant to his royal highness for his majesty's life, the said fifty thousand pounds per annum, to be issued out of the civil-list revenues, over and above the prince's revenues arising from the dutchy of Corn∣wall, which his majesty thought a very competent allowance, considering his own num<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rous issue, and the great expence which did and must necessarily attend an honourable provision for the whole royal family: that the prince, by a verbal answer, desired their lordships to lay him with all humility at his majesty's feet: to assure him, that he did and ever should retain the utmost duty for his royal person: that he was very thankful for any instance of his majesty's goodness to him or to the princess, and particularly for his majesty's gracious intention of settling a jointure upon her royal highness; but, that as to the message, the affair was now out of his hands, and therefore he could give no answer to it: that his royal highness afterwards used many dutiful expressions towards his majesty; adding, "Indeed my lords, it is in other hands, and I am sorry for it;" or words to that effect. He then endeavoured to demonstrate, that the annual sum of fifty thousand pounds was as much as the king could afford to allow for the prince's maintenance; and he expatiated upon the bad consequences that might ensue, if the son should be rendered altogether independent of the father.</P>

<P>These suggestions did not pass unanswered. Sir Robert Walpole had asserted, that the parliament had no right to interfere in the creation or maintenance of a prince of Wales; and, that in the case of Richard II. who upon the death of his father the black prince, was created prince of Wales, in con∣s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quence of an address or petition from parliament, that measure was in all pro∣bability directed by the king himself. In answer to this assertion it was ob∣served, that probably the king would not have been so forward in creating his grandson prince of Wales, if he had not been forced into this step by his par∣liament; for, Edward in his old age fell into a sort of love-dotage, and gave himself intirely up to the management of his mistress Alice Pierce, and his second son the duke of Lancaster; a circumstance that raised a most reasonable jea∣lousy
<PB N="574" REF="5770"/>
in the black prince, at that time on his death-bed, who could not but be anxious about the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ety and right of his only son, whom he found he was soon to leave a child in the hands of a doating grandfather, and an ambitious aspiring uncle. The supporters of the motion observed, that the allowance of fifty thousand pounds was not sufficient to defray the prince's yearly expence, with∣out alotting one shilling for acts of charity and munificence; and that the several deductions for land-taxes and fees reduced it to forty-three thousand pounds. They affirmed, that his whole income, including the revenues of the dutchy of Cornwall did not exceed fifty-two thousand pounds a-year, though, by his ma∣jesty's own regulation, the expence of the prince's houshold amounted to sixty-three thousand. They proved, that the produce of the civil-list exceeded nine hundred thousand pounds, a sum above one hundred thousand pounds a-year more than was enjoyed by his late majesty: that in the first year of the late king the whole expence of his houshold and civil government did not much exceed four hun∣dred and fifty thousand pounds a-year. They observed, that the parliament added one hundred and forty thousand pounds annually for acts of charity and bounty, to∣gether with the article of secret-service money; and allowed one hundred thou∣sand pounds for the maintenance of the prince of Wales: that the article of secret-service money had prodigiously increased in the late reign: by an account which happened to be layed before the parliament, it appeared, that vast sums of money had been given for purposes which no body understood, and to persons whom no body knew. In the beginning of the following session several mem∣bers resolved, that this extraordinary account should be taken into consideration; but the inquiry was warded off by the other party, who declared, that the par∣liament could not examine any account which had been presented to a former session. The debate was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ierce and long; and ended in a division, by which the motion was rejected. A motion of the same nature was made by the lord Car∣teret in the house of peers, and gave rise to a very keen dispute, maintained by the same arguments, and issuing in the same termination.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>The next remarkable contest was occasioned by a motion of Sir R. Walpole, who proposed, that the sum of one million should be granted to his majesty, towards redeeming the like sum of the increased capital of the South-sea company, commonly called South-sea annuities. Several members argued for the expediency of applying this sum to the payment of the debt due to the bank, as part of that incumbrance was saddled with an interest of six per cent. whereas the interest payed for the other sums that constituted the public debt, did not exceed four per cent. Many plausible arguments were offered on both sides of the question; and at length, the motion was carried in the affirmative. The house having resolved itself into a committee, to consider of the national debt, Sir John Barnard made a motion, for enabling his majesty to raise money either by the sale of annuities, or by borrowing at an interest not exceeding three per cent. to be applied towards redeeming the South-sea annuities; and, that such of the said annuitants as should be inclined to subscribe their respective an∣nuities, should be preferred to all others. He said, that even those public securities which bore an interest of three per cent. only, were sold at a premium in Change-alley: he was therefore persuaded, that all those who were willing to give a premium for a three per cent. security, would gladly lend his money to the government at the same interest, should books of subscription be opened
<PB N="575" REF="5780"/>
for that purpose, with an assurance that no part of the principal should be payed off for fourteen years. He expatiated upon the national advantages that would accrue from a reduction of interest. From easy and obvious calculations he inferred, that in a very little time the interest upon all the South-sea annui∣ties would be reduced from four to three per cent. without any danger to public credit, or breach of public faith: that then the produce of the sinking fund would amount to fourteen hundred thousand pounds per annum, to be applied only towards redeeming the capital of the several trading companies: this measure would bring every one of them so much within the power of parlia∣ment, that they would be glad to accept of three per cent. interest on any rea∣sonable terms; in which case the sinking fund would rise to one million six hundred thousand pounds per annum. Then the parliament might venture to annihilate one half of it, by freeing the people from the taxes upon coals, can∣dles, soap, leather, and other such impositions as lay heavy upon the poor la∣bourers and manufacturers: the remaining part of the sinking fund might be applied towards the discharge of those annuities and public debts which bore an interest of three per cent. only, and afterwards towards diminishing the capi∣tals of the several trading companies till the term of fourteen years should be expired; then the sinking fund would again amount to above a million yearly, which would be sufficient for paying them off, and freeing the nation intirely from all its incumbrances. This salutary scheme was violently opposed by alderman Heathcote and other partisans of the ministry; yet all their objections were refuted: and, in order to defeat the project, they were obliged to have recourse to artifice. Mr. Winnington moved, that all the public creditors, as well as the South-sea annuitants, should be comprehended. Sir John Barnard demonstrated, that it might be easy for the government to borrow money at three per cent. sufficient for paying off such of the proprietors of four and twenty millions as were not willing to accept of that interest, but extremely difficult to borrow enough to satisfy the proprietors of four and forty millions, who might choose to have their principal rather than such an interest. Never∣theless, resolutions were founded on this and other alterations of the original scheme; and a bill was immediately prepared. It produced many other de∣bates, and was at last postponed by dint of ministerial influence. The same venerable patriot who projected this scheme, moved, that as soon as the interest of all the national redeemable debt should be reduced to three per cent. the house would take off some of the heavy taxes which oppressed the poor and the manufacturers. But this motion was rejected by the majority.</P>

<P>The last disputes of this session were excited by a bill sent down from the lords for punishing the magistrates and city of Edinburgh, on account of the murder of John Porteous. In the beginning of the session lord Carteret recapitulated the several tumults and riots which had lately happened in different parts of the kingdom. He particularly insisted upon the atrocious murder of captain Porteous, as a flagrant insult upon the government, and a violation of the public peace, so much the more dangerous as it seemed to have been concerted and executed with deliberation and decency. He suspected that some citizens of Edinburgh had been concerned in the murder, not only from this circumstance, but likewise because, notwithstanding the reward of two hun∣dred pounds which had been offered by proclamation for the discovery of any
<PB N="576" REF="5790"/>
person who acted in that tragedy, not one individual had as yet been detected. He seemed to think, that the magistrates had encouraged the riot, and that the city had forfeited its charter; and he proposed a minute inquiry into the par∣ticulars of the affair. He was seconded by the duke of Newcastle and the earl of Ilay; though this last nobleman differed in opinion from him with respect to the charter of the city, which he said could not be justly forfeited by the fault of the magistracy. The lords resolved, That the magistrates and other per∣sons from whom they might obtain the necessary information concerning this riot, should be ordered to attend: and, That an address should be presented to his majesty, desiring, that the different accounts and papers relating to the mur∣der of captain Porteous, might be submitted to the perusal of the house. These documents being accordingly examined, and all the witnesses arrived, including three Scottish judges, a debate arose about the manner in which these should be interrogated, whether at the bar, at the table, or on the woolsacks. Some Scottish lords asserted, that they had a right to be seated next to the judges of England; but after a long debate this claim was rejected, and the judges of Scotland appeared at the bar in their robes. A bill was brought in to disable Alexander Wilson, esquire, lord-provost of Edinburgh, from enjoying any office or place of magistracy in the city of Edinburgh, or elsewhere in Great-Britain; for imprisoning the said Alexander Wilson; for abolishing the guard of that city; and for taking away the gates of the Nether-Bow-Port, so as to open a communication between the city and the suburbs in which the king's troops are quartered. The duke of Argyle, in arguing against this bill, said, he could not think of a proceeding more harsh or unprecedented than the pre∣sent, as he believed there was no instance of the whole weight of parliamentary indignation, for such he called a proceeding by a bill ex post facto, falling upon any single person, far less upon any community, for crimes that were within the reach of the inferior courts of justice: for this reason he observed, that if the lord-provost and citizens of Edinburgh should suffer in the terms of the present bill, they would suffer by a cruel, unjust, and a fantastical proceed∣ing; a proceeding of which the worst use might be made, if ever the nation should have the misfortune to fall under a partial self-interested administration. He told them he sat in the parliament of Scotland when that part of the treaty of union relating to the privileges of the royal burghs, was settled on the same footing as religion, that is, they were not alterable by any subsequent parlia∣ment of Great-Britain. Notwithstanding the eloquence and warmth of his remonstrance, the bill was sent down to the house of commons, where it pro∣duced a violent contest. The commons set on foot a severe scrutiny into the particular circumstances that preceded and attended the murder of Porteous; and from the examination of the evidences it appeared, that no freeman or citizen of Edinburgh was concerned in the riot, which was chiefly composed of country-people, excited by the relations of some unhappy persons whom Porteous and his men had slain at the execution of the smuggler; and these were assisted by prentice boys and the lowest class of vagabonds that happened to be at Edinburgh: that the lord-provost had taken all the precautions to prevent mischief that his reflection suggested; that he even exposed his person to the rage of the multitude, in his endeavours to disperse them; and, that if he had done amiss, he erred from want of judgment, rather than from want of
<PB N="57$" REF="5800"/>
inclination to protect the unhappy Porteous. It likewise appeared, that Mr. Lindsay, member for the city of Edinburgh, had gone in person to general Moyle, commander of the forces in North-Britain, informed him of the riot, implored his immediate assistance, and promised to conduct his troops into the city; and that his suit was rejected because he could not produce a written order from the magistracy, which he neither could have obtained in such confusion, nor ventured to carry about his person through the midst of an enraged popu∣lace. The Scottish members exerted themselves with uncommon vivacity in defence of their capital. They were joined by Sir John Barnard, lord Corn∣bury, Mr. Shippen, and Mr. Oglethorpe. Lord Polwarth declared, that if any gentleman would shew where one argument in the charge against the lord-provost and city of Edinburgh had been proved, he would that instant give his vote for the commitment of the bill. He said, if gentlemen would lay their hands upon their hearts, and ask themselves, whether they would have voted in that manner, had the case of Edinburgh been that of the city of Bristol, York, or Norwich, he was persuaded they would have required, that every tittle of the charge against them should have been fully and undeniably proved. Some amendments and mitigations being inserted in the bill, it passed the house, was sent back to the lords, who agreed to the alterations; and then it received the royal assent.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>The next effort of the minister was obliquely levelled at the liberty of the press, which it was much for his interest to abridge. The errors of his conduct, the mystery of that corruption which he had so successfully re∣duced to a system, and all the blemishes of his administration, had been exposed and ridiculed, not only in political periodical writings produced by the most eminent hands, but likewise in a succession of theatrical pieces, which met with uncommon success among the people. He either wanted judgment to distin∣guish men of genius, or could find none that would engage in his service. He therefore employed a set of wretched authors, void of understanding and inge∣nuity. They undertook the defence of his ministry, and answered the ammad∣versions of his antagonists. The match was so extremely unequal, that in∣stead of justifying his conduct, they exposed it to additional ridicule and con∣tempt; and he saw himself in danger of being despised by the whole nation. He resolved to seize the first opportunity to choak those canals through which the torrent of censure had flowed upon his character. The manager of a playhouse communicated to him a manuscript farce, intituled, The golden rump, which was fraught with treason and abuse upon the government, and had been presented to the stage for exhibition. This performance was produced in the house of commons. The minister descanted upon the insolence, the malice, the immorality, the seditious calumny, which had been of late propagated in theatrical pieces. A bill was brought in to limit the number of playhouses; to subject all dramatic writers to the inspection of the lord-chamberlain, and compel them to take out a licence for every production before it could appear on the stage. Notwithstanding a vigorous opposition, this bill passed through both houses with extraordinary dispatch, and obtained the royal sanction. In this debate the earl of Chesterfield distinguished himself by an excellent speech, that will ever endear his character to all the friends of genius and literature, to all those who are warmed with zeal for the liberties of their country. <Q>“Our
<PB N="578" REF="5810"/>
stage, said he, ought certainly to be kept within due bounds; but, for this purpose, our laws as they stand at present are sufficient. If our stage-players at any time exceed those bounds, they ought to be prosecuted; they may be punished. We have precedents, we have examples of persons punished for things less criminal than some pieces which have been lately represented: a new law must therefore be unnecessary; and in the present case it cannot be unnecessary without being dangerous. Every unnecessary restraint is a fetter upon the legs, is a shackle upon the hands of liberty. One of the greatest blessings we enjoy, one of the greatest blessings a people can enjoy, is liberty. But every good in this life has its allay of evil. Licentiousness is the allay of liberty. It is an ebullition, an excrescence; it is a speck upon the eye of the political body, which I can never touch but with a gentle—with a trem∣bling hand, lest I destroy the body; lest I injure the eye upon which it is apt to appear. If the stage becomes at any time licentious, if a play appears to be a libel upon the government, or upon any particular man, the king's courts are open, the law is sufficient to punish the offender. If poets and players are to be restrained, let them be restrained as other subjects are, by the known laws of their country; if they offend, let them be tried as every Englishman ought to be, by God and their country. Do not let us subject them to the arbitrary will and pleasure of any one man. A power lodged in the hands of a single man to judge and determine without limitation, con∣trol or appeal, is a sort of power unknown to our laws, inconsistent with our constitution. It is a higher, a more absolute power than we trust even to the king himself; and therefore I must think, we ought not to vest any such power in his majesty's lord-chamberlain.”</Q> His arguments had no effect, though the house admired his elocution; and the playhouse bill passed into a law. On the twenty-first day of June the king made a short speech to both houses, and the lord-chancellor prorogued the parliament.</P>

<P>A Congress had been opened at Niemerow in Poland, to compromise the differences between the czarina and the grand signor; but, this proving ineffectual, the emperor declared war against the Turk, and demanded assistance from the diet of the empire. He concerted the operations of the campaign with the empress of Muscovy; and it was agreed, that the Imperia∣lists under count Seckendorf should attack Widin in Servia, while the Rus∣sians, commanded by count de Munich, should penetrate to the Ukraine, and besiege Oczakow on the Boristhenes. They accordingly advanced against this place, which was garrisoned by twenty thousand men; and on the side of the Boristhenes, defended by eighteen gallies. The Muscovites carried on their approaches with such impetuosity and perseverance, that the Turks were ter∣rified at their valour, and in a few days capitulated. Among those who signa∣lized themselves by uncommon marks of prowess in these attacks, was general Keith, now field-marshal in the Prussian service, who was dangerously wounded
<PB N="580" REF="5830"/>
on this occasion. Mean while count Seckendorf finding it impossible to reduce Widin without a squadron of ships on the Danube, turned his arms against Nissa, which was surrendered to him on the eight and twentieth day of July. But this was the farthest verge of his good fortune. The Turks attacked the posts which the Imperialists occupied along the Danube. They took the fort of Padudil, burned the town of Ilas in Walachia, and plundered the neighbouring villages. The prince of Saxe-hildburghausen, who had invested Bagnalack in Bosnia, was defeated and obliged to repass the Saave. Count Seckendorf was recalled to Vienna; and the command of the army devolved upon count Phi∣lippi. Count Kevenhuller was obliged to retreat from Servia; and Nissa was retaken by the Muss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lmans. The conferences at Niemcrow were broken off; and the Turkish plenipotentiaries returned to Constantinople.</P>

<P>The kingdom of Poland now enjoyed the most perfect repose under the dominion of Augustus. Ferdinand, the old duke of Courland, dying without issue the succession was disputed by the Teutonic order and the kingdom of Po∣land, while the states of Courland claimed a right of election, and sent deputies to Petersburgh, imploring the protection of the czarina. A body of Russian troops immediately entered that country; and the states elected the count de Biron, high-chamberlain to the empress of Muscovy. The elector of Cologne, as grand-master of the Teutonic order, protested against this election; but, the king of Poland agreed to it, on certain conditions settled at Dantzick, with the commissaries of the new duke and those of the czarina. In the month of July John Gaston de Medicis, great duke of Tuscany, died at Florence; and the prince de Craon took possession of his territories in the name of the duke of Lorrain, to whom the emperor had already granted the eventual investiture of that dutchy.</P>

<P>In England the attention of the public was attracted by an open breach in the royal family. The princess of Wales had advanced to the very last month of her pregnancy before the king and queen were informed of her being with child. She was twice conveyed from Hampton-court to the palace of St. James's, when her labour-pains were supposed to be approaching; and at length was delivered of a princess in about two hours after her arrival. The king being apprized of this event, sent a message by the earl of Essex to the prince, expressing his displeasure at the conduct of his royal highness, as an in∣dignity offered to himself and the queen. The prince deprecated his majesty's anger in several submissive letters, and implored the queen's mediation. The princess joined her intreaties to those of his royal highness; but all their humi¦lity and supplication proved ineffectual. The king, in another message sent by the duke of Grafton, observed, that the prince had removed the princess twice in the week immediately preceding the day of her delivery, from the place of his majesty's residence, in expectation of her labour; and both times on his return, industriously concealed from the knowledge of the king and queen every cir∣cumstance relating to this important affair. That at last, without giving any notice to their majesties, he had precipitately hurried the princess from Hamp∣ton-court in a condition not to be named: that the whole tenour of his con∣duct, for a considerable time, had been so intirely void of all real duty to the king, that his majesty had reason to be highly offended with him. He gave him to understand, that until he should withdraw his regard and confidence from
<PB N="581" REF="5840"/>
those by whose instigation and advice he was directed and encouraged in his unwarrantable behaviour to his majesty and the queen, and return to his duty, he should not reside in the palace: he therefore signified his pleasure that he should leave St. James's, with all his family, when it could be done without prejudice or inconvenience to the princess. In obedience to this order, the prince retired to Kew, and made other efforts to be readmitted into his ma∣jesty's favour, which, however, he could not retrieve. Whatever might have been his design in concealing so long from the king and queen the pregnancy of the princess, and afterwards hurrying her from place to place in such a con∣dition, to the manifest hazard of her life, his majesty had certainly cause to be offended at this part of his conduct; though the punishment seems to have been severe, if not rigorous; for he was not even admitted into the presence of the queen his mother, to express his duty to her, in her last moments, to implore her forgiveness, and receive her last blessing. She died of a mortifi∣cation in her bowels, on the twentieth day of November, in the fifty-fifth year of her age, regretted as a princess of uncommon sagacity, and as a pat∣tern of conjugal virtue.</P>

<P>The king opened the session of parliament on the twenty-fourth day of January, with a short speech, recommending the dispatch of the pub∣lic business with prudence and unanimity. Each house presented a warm address of condolence on the queen's death, with which he seemed to be ex∣tremely affected. Though the house of commons unanimously sympathized with the king in his affliction, the minister still met with contradiction in some of his favourite measures. One would imagine that all the arguments for and against a standing army in time of peace, had been already exhausted; but, when it was moved that the same number of land-forces which they had voted in the preceding year should be continued in pay for the ensuing year, the dispute was renewed with surprising vivacity, and produced some reasons which had not been suggested before. The adherents of the minister fairly owned, that if the army should be disbanded, or even considerably reduced, they believed the Tory interest would prevail: that the present number of forces was abso∣lutely necessary to maintain the peace of the kingdom, which was filled with clamour and discontent, as well as to support the Whig interest; and that they would vote for keeping up four times the number, should it be found expe∣dient for that purpose. The members in the opposition replied, that this de∣claration was a severe satire on the ministry, whose conduct had given birth to such a spirit of discontent. They said it was in effect a tacit acknowledg∣ment, that what they called the Whig interest was no more than an inconsider∣able party which had engrossed the administration by indirect methods; which acted contrary to the sense of the nation, and depended for support upon a military power, by which the people in general were overawed, and conse∣quently enslaved. They affirmed, that the discontent of which the ministry complained, was in a great measure owing to that very standing army which perpetuated their taxes, and hung over their heads, as the instruments of arbi∣trary power and oppression. Lord Polworth explained the nature of Whig principles, and demonstrated, that the party which distinguished itself by this appellation, no longer retained the maxims by which the Whigs were origi∣nally characterised. Sir John Hynde Cotton, who spoke with the courage
<PB N="582" REF="5850"/>
and freedom of an old English baron, declared he never knew a member of that house who acted on true Whig principles vote for a standing army in time of peace. <Q>“I have heard of Whigs (said he) who opposed all unlimited votes of credit: I have heard of Whigs who looked upon corruption as the greatest curse that could befall any nation: I have heard of Whigs who esteemed the liberty of the press to be the most valuable privilege of a free people, and triennial parliaments as the greatest bulwark of their liberties; and I have heard of a Whig administration which had resented injuries done to the trade of the nation, and revenged insults offered to the British flag.”</Q> The ministry triumphed as usual, and the same number of forces was con∣tinued.</P>

<P>Ever since the treaty of Seville, the Spaniards in America had almost incessantly insulted and distressed the commerce of Great-Britain. They dis∣puted the right of English traders to cut logwood in the bay of Campeachy, and gather salt on the island of I ortugas; though that right was acknowledged by implication in all the treaties which had been lately concluded between the two nations. The captains of their armed vessels, known by the name of guard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> costas, had made a practice of boarding and plundering British ships, on pretence of searching for contraband commodities, on which occasions they had behaved with the utmost insolence, cruelty, and rapine. Some of their ships of war had actually attacked a fleet of English merchant-ships at the island of Tortugas, as if they had been at open enmity with England. They had seized and detained a great number of British vessels, imprisoned their crews and confiscated their cargoes, in violation of treaties, in defiance of common justice and humanity. Repeated memorials were presented to the court of Spain, by the British ambassador at Madrid. He was amused with evasive answers, vague promises of inquiry, and cedulas of instructions sent to the Spanish governors in America, to which they payed no sort of regard. Not but that the Spaniards had reason to complain in their turn, of the illicit com∣merce which the English traders from Jamaica and other islands carried on with their subjects on the continent of South-America; though this could not justify the depredations and cruelties which the commanders of the guarda costas had committed, without provocation or pretence.</P>

<P>The merchants of England loudly complained of these outrages: the nation was fired with resentment, and cried for vengeance; but the mi∣nister appeared cold, phlegmatic, and timorous. He knew that a war would involve him in such difficulties as must of necessity endanger his administra∣tion. The treasure which he now employed for domestic purposes, must in that case be expended in military armaments: the wheels of that machine on which he had raised his influence would no longer move: the opposition would of consequence gain ground, and the imposition of fresh taxes, necessary for the maintenance of the war, would fill up the measure of popular resentment against his person and ministry. Moved by these considerations, he industri∣ously endeavoured to avoid a rupture, and to obtain some sort of satisfaction by dint of memorials and negotiations, in which he betrayed his own fears to such a degree as encouraged the Spaniards to persist in their depredations, and the court of Madrid to disregard the remonstrances of the British ambassador. But his apprehension of war did not proceed from Spain only: the two branches
<PB N="583" REF="5860"/>
of the house of Bourbon were now united by politics as well as by consangui∣nity; and he did not doubt, that in case of a rupture with Spain, they would join their forces against Great-Britain. Petitions were delivered to the house by merchants from different parts of the kingdom, explaining the re∣peated violences to which they had been exposed, and imploring relief of the parliament. These were referred to a committee of the whole house; and an order was made to admit the petitioners, if they should think fit to be heard by themselves or by counsel. Sir John Barnard moved for an address to the king, that all the memorials and papers relating to the Spanish depredations should be layed before the house; and this, with some alteration proposed by Sir Robert Walpole, was actually presented. In compliance with the request, an enormous multitude of letters and memorials was produced.</P>

<P>The house, in a grand committee, proceeded to hear counsel for the merchants, and examine evidence; by which it appeared that amazing acts of wanton cruelty and injustice had been perpetrated by Spaniards on the sub∣jects of Great-Britain. Mr. Pulteney expatiated upon these circumstances of barbarity. He demonstrated, from treaties, the right of the British traders to the logwood of Campeachy, and the salt of Tortugas: he exposed the pusilla∣nimity of the minister, and the futility of his negotiations; and he moved for such resolutions as would evince the resentment of an injured nation, and the vigour of a British parliament. These were warmly combated by Sir Robert Walpole, who affirmed they would cramp the ministers in their en∣deavours to compromise these differences: that they would frustrate their ne∣gotiations, intrench upon the king's prerogative, and precipitate the nation into an unnecessary and expensive war. Answers produced replies, and a ge∣neral debate ensued. A resolution was reported; but the question being put for recommitting it, was carried in the negative. The house, however, agreed to an address, beseeching his majesty to use his endeavours to obtain effectual relief for his injured subjects, to convince the court of Spain that his majesty could no longer suffer such constant and repeated insults and injuries to be carried on, to the dishonour of his crown, and to the ruin of his trading sub∣jects; and assuring him, that in case his royal and friendly instances with the catholic king should miscarry, the house would effectually support his majesty in taking such measures as honour and justice should make it necessary for him to pursue. To this address the king made a favourable answer.</P>

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1738.</NOTE> The next important subject on which both sides exercised their ta∣lents, was a bill prepared and brought in by Mr. Pulteney, for the more ef∣fectual securing the trade of his majesty's subjects in America. This was no other than the revival of part of two acts passed in the reign of queen Anne, by which the property of all prizes taken from the enemy was vested in the captors; and the sovereign was empowered to grant commissions or charters to any persons or societies, for taking any ships, goods, harbours, lands, or fortifications of the nation's enemies in America, and for holding and enjoy∣ing the same as their own property and estate for ever. The ministry en∣deavoured to evade the discussion of this bill, by amusing the house with other business, until an end should be put to the session. A mean artifice was practised with this view; and some severe altercation passed between Sir Robert Walpole and Mr. Pulteney. At length the bill was read, and gave
<PB N="584" REF="5870"/>
rise to a very long and warm contest, in which the greatest orators of both sides found opportunities to display their eloquence and satire. Mr. Pulteney defended the bill with all the ardour of paternal affe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion; but, notwithstand∣ing his warmest endeavours, it was rejected upon a division.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>When the mutiny-bill was sent up to the house of lords, a long de∣ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e arose upon the number of troops voted for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsuing year. Lord Car∣teret explained the situation of affairs in almost every nation of Europe, with great conciseness and precision. He demonstrated the improbability of a rup∣ture between Great-Britain and any power, against which a land-army could be of any service. He examined the domestic circumstances of the nation; and proved, that whatever discontents there might be in the kingdom, there was little or no disaffection, and no seeming design to overturn or disturb the go∣vernment. In answer to an argument that such a number of regular forces was necessary for preventing or quelling <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umults, and for enabling the civil magi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trate to execute the laws of his country, he expressed his hope that he sho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld nev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r see the nation reduced to such unfortunate circumstances: he said a law which the civil power was unable to execute, must either be in itself op∣pressive, or such a one as afforded a handle for oppression. In arguing for a reduction of the forces, he took notice of the g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eat increase of the national expence. He observed, that before the revolution, the people of England <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id not raise above two millions for the whole of the public charge; but now what was called the current expence for which the parliament annually pro∣vided, exceeded that sum, besides the civil list, the interest due to the public creditors, and the sinking-fund, which, added together, composed a burthen of six millions yearly. The earl of Chesterfield on the same subject affirmed, that slavery and arbitrary power were the certain consequences of keeping up a standing army for any number of years. It is the machine by which the chains of slavery are rivetted upon a free people. They may be secretly pre∣pared by corruption; but, unless a standing army protected those that forged them, the people would break them asunder, and chop off the polluted hands by which they were prepared. By degrees a free people must be accustomed to be governed by an army: by degrees that army must be made strong enough to hold them in subjection. England had for many years been ac∣customed to a standing army, under pretence of its being necessary to assist the civil power; and by degrees the number and strength of it have been in∣creasing. At the accession of the late king it did not exceed six thousand: it soon amounted to double that number, which has been since augmented under various pretences. He therefore concluded, that slavery, under the disguise of an army for protecting the liberties of the people, was creeping in upon them by degrees: if no reduction should be made, he declared he should expect in a few years to hear some minister, or favourite of a minister, terrifying the house with imaginary plots and invasions, and making the tour of Europe in search of poss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e dangers, to shew the necessity of keeping up a mercenary standing army three times as numerous as the present. In spite of these suggestions, the standing army maintained its ground. The same noblemen, assisted by lord Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurst, distinguished them<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elves in a debate upon the Spanish depre∣dations, which comprehended the same arguments that were us<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in the house of commons. They met with the same success in both. Resolutions equi∣valent
<PB N="585" REF="5880"/>
to those of the lower house, were taken: an address was presented; and his majesty assured them he would repeat, in the most pressing manner, his instances at the court of Spain, in order to obtain satisfaction and security for his subjects trading to America. This assurance was renewed in his speech at the close of the session, on the twentieth of May, when the parliament was prorogued.</P>

<P>At this period the princess of Wales was delivered of a son, who was baptized by the name of George, now heir apparent to the crown. His birth was celebrated with uncommon rejoicings: addresses of congratulation were presented to the king by the two universities, and almost all the cities and communities of the kingdom. But the prince of Wales still laboured under the displeasure of his majesty, who had ordered the lord chamberlain to signify in the Gazette, that no person who visited the prince should be admitted to the court of St. James's. His royal highness was divested of all the external marks of royalty, and lived like a private gentleman, cultivating the virtues of a social life, and enjoying the best fruits of conjugal felicity. In the latter end of this month, rear-admiral Haddock set sail with a strong squadron for the Mediterranean, which it was hoped would give weight to the negotiation of the British minister at the court of Madrid. The act to discourage the re∣tail of spirituous liquors had incensed the populace to such a degree as oc∣casioned numberless tumults in the cities of London and Westminster. They were so addicted to the use of that pernicious compound known by the ap∣pellation of gin or ginievre, that they ran all risques rather than forego it en∣tirely; and so little regard was payed to the law by which it was prohibited, that in less than two years twelve thousand persons within the bills of mortality were convicted of having sold it illegally. Nearly one half of that number was cast in the penalty of one hundred pounds; and three thousand persons payed ten pounds each, for an exemption from the disgrace of being com∣mitted to the house of correction.</P>

<P>The war maintained by the emperor and the czarina against the Ot∣toman Porte had not yet produced any decisive event. Count Seckendorf was disgraced and confined, on account of the ill success of the last campaign. General Doxat was tried by a council of war at Belgrade, and condemned to death for having surrendered to the enemy the town of Nissa, in which he com∣manded. The diet of the empire granted a subsidy of fifty Roman months to the emperor, who began to make vigorous preparations for the ensuing campaign: but, in the mean time, Ragotski, vaivode of Transylvania, re∣volted against the house of Austria, and brought a considerable army into the field, under the protection of the grand signor. He was immediately pro∣claimed a rebel, and a price set upon his head by the court of Vienna. The Turks taking the field early, reduced the fort of Usitza, and Meadia, and undertook the siege of Orsova, which, however, they abandoned at the approach of the Imperial army, commanded by the grand duke of Tus∣cany, assisted by count Konigsegg. The Turks being reinforced, marched back and attacked the Imperialists, by whom they were repulsed after an obstinate engagement. The Germans, notwithstanding this advantage, repassed the Danube; and then the infidels made themselves masters of Orsova, where they found a fine train of artillery, designed for the siege of
<PB N="586" REF="5890"/>
Widin. By the conquest of this place, the Turks laid the Danube open to their gallies and vessels; and the Germans retired under the cannon of Bel∣grade. In the Ukraine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Russians under general count Munich obtained the advantage over the Turks in two engagements; and general Lacy routed the Tartars of the Crimea: but they returned in greater numbers, and har∣rassed the Muscovites in such a manner, by intercepting their provisions, and destroying the country, that they were obliged to abandon the lines of Precops.</P>

<P>In the month of October, an affair of very small importance pro∣duced a rupture between the king of Denmark and the elector of Hanover. A detachment of Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> overians took by assault the castle of Steinhorst, belong∣ing to the privy counsellor Wederkop, and defended by thirty Danish dra∣goons, who had received orders to repel force by force. Several men were killed on both sides, before the Hanoverians could enter the place, when the garrison was disarmed and conducted to the frontiers. This petty dispute, about a small territory which did not yield the value of one thousand pounds a year, had well nigh involved Hanover in a wa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which, in all probability, Great-Britain must have maintained: but this dispute was compromised by a con∣vention between the kings of England and Denmark.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The session of parliament was opened on the first day of February, when the king, in his speech to both houses, gave them to understand, that a convention was concluded and ratified between him and the king of Spain, who had obliged himself to make reparation to the British subjects for their losses, by certain stipulated payments: that plenipotentiaries were named and appointed for regulating, within a limited time, all those grievances and abuses which had hitherto interrupted the commerce of Great-Britain in the Ameri∣can seas; and for settling all matters in dispute, in such a manner as might for the future prevent and remove all new causes and pretences of complaint. The motion for an address of approbation was disputed as usual. Though the convention was not yet layed before the house, the nature of it was well known to the leaders of the opposition. Sir William Wyndham observed, that if the ministry had made the resolutions taken by the parliament in the last session the foundation of their demands; if they had discovered a resolu∣tion to break off all treating, rather than depart from the sense of parliament, either a defensive treaty might have been obtained, or by this time the worst would have been known: but, by what appeared from his majesty's speech, the convention was no other than a preliminary; and, in all probability, a very bad preliminary. He supposed the minister had ventured to clothe some of his creatures with full powers to give up the rights of the nation; for they might do it if they durst. Sir Robert Walpole, in answer to these suggestions, affirmed, that the ministry had on this occasion obtained more than ever on like occasions was known to be obtained: that they had reconciled the peace of their country with her true interest: that this peace was attended with all the advantage that the most successful arms could have procured: that future ages would consider this as the most glorious period of our history, and do justice to the counsels that produced the happy event, which every gentleman divested of passion and prejudice was ready to do; and which, he believed, the present age, when rightly informed, would not refuse. In a
<PB N="587" REF="5900"/>
word, he extolled his own convention with the most extravagant enco∣miums.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="14" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIV.</HEAD>
<P>The house resolved to address the king, that copies of all the memo∣rials, representations, letters, and papers, presented to his majesty, or his se∣cretary of state, relating to depredations, should be submitted to the perusal of the house: but some members in the opposition were not contented with this resolution. Then Mr. Sandys, who may be termed "the motion-maker," moved for an address, desiring that the house might inspect all letters written, and instructions given by the secretaries of state, or commissioners of the ad∣miralty, to any of the British governors in America, or any commander in chief<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or captains of his majesty's ships of war, or his majesty's minister at the court of Spain, or any of his majesty's consuls in Europe, since the treaty of Seville, relating to losses which the British subjects had sustained by means of depreda∣tions committed by the subjects of Spain in Europe and America. This was an unreasonable proposal suggested by the spirit of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mosity and faction. Mr. H. Walpole justly observed, that a compliance with such an address might lay open the most private transactions of the cabinet, and discover secrets that ought, for the good of the kingdom, to be concealed. It would discover to the court of Spain, the ultimatum of the king's demands and concessions, and the nation might thereby be deprived of many advantages which it might reap, were no such discovery made. He said, that as soon as the differences betwixt the two courts should arrive at such a crisis, and not before, the con∣suls were instructed to give notice to the merchants, that they might retire in time with their effects; but, should such instruction come to the knowledge of the Spaniards, it would be a kind of watch-word to put them on their guard, and unavoidably occasion the ruin of many thousands of British subjects. Certain it is, no government could act either in external or domestic affairs with proper influence, dignity, and dispatch, if every letter and instruction relating to an unfinished negotiation should be exposed to the view of such a numerous assembly, composed of individuals actuated by motives in them∣selves diametrically opposite. The motion being rejected by the majority, the same gentleman moved again for an address, that his majesty would give di∣rections for laying before the house, copies of such memorials or representa∣tions as had been made, either to the king of Spain or to his ministers, since the treaty of Seville, relating to the depredations committed in Europe or America. A debate ensued; and, upon a division, the question passed in the negative.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The house, in a committee of supply, voted twelve thousand sea∣men for the service of the ensuing year; and the standing army was continued without reduction, though powerfully attacked by the whole strength of the opposition. The commons likewise ordered an address to his majesty, for the copies of several memorials since the treaty of Seville, touching the rights of Great-Britain, or any infraction of treaties which had not been layed before them. They were accordingly submitted to the inspecton of the house. By this time the convention itself was not only presented to the commons, but also published for the information of the people. Divers merchants, planters, and others, trading to America, the cities of London and Bristol, the merchants of Liver∣pool, and the owners of sundry ships which had been seized by the Spaniards<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="588" REF="5910"/>
offered petitions against the convention, by which the subjects of Spain were so far from giving up their groundless and unjustifiable practice of visiting and searching British ships sailing to and from the British plantations, that they appeared to have claimed the power of doing it as a right, by having insisted that the differences which had arisen concerning it should be referred to pleni∣potentiaries, to be discussed by them, without even agreeing to abstain from such visitation and search during the time that the discussion of this affair might last. They therefore prayed, that they might have an opportunity of being heard, and allowed to represent the great importance of the British trade to and from the plantations in America; the clear indisputable right which they had to enjoy it, without being stopped, visited, or searched, by the Spaniards, on any pretence whatsoever; and the certain inevitable de∣struction of all the riches and strength derived to Great-Britain from that trade, if a search of British ships sailing to and from their own plantations, should be tolerated upon any pretext, or under any restrictions, or even if the freedom of this navigation should continue much longer in a state of uncertainty. These petitions were referred to the committee appointed to consider of the convention. Another remonstrance was likewise presented by the trustees for establishing the colony of Georgia, setting forth, that the king of Spain claimed that colony as part of his territories; and that by the convention the regulation of the limits of Carolina and Florida was referred to the determina∣tion of plenipotentiaries; so that the colony of Georgia, which undoubtedly belonged to the crown of Great-Britain, was left in dispute, while the settlers remained in the most precarious and dangerous situation. It was moved, that the merchants should be heard by their counsel: but the proposal was stre∣nuously opposed by the ministry, and rejected upon a division.</P>

<P>This famous convention, concluded at the Pardo on the fourteenth day of January, imported, That within six weeks, to be reckoned from the day on which the ratifications were exchanged, two ministers plenipotentiaries should meet at Madrid, to confer and finally regulate the respective pretensions of the two crowns, with relation to the trade and navigation in America and Europe, and to the limits of Florida and Carolina, as well as concerning other points which remained likewise to be adjusted, according to the former treaties subsisting between the two nations: that the plenipotentiaries should finish their confe∣rences within the space of eight months: That in the mean time no progress should be made in the fortifications of Florida and Carolina: That his catholic majesty should pay to the king of Great-Britain the sum of ninety-five thou∣sand pounds, for a balance due to the crown and subjects of Great-Britain, after deduction made of the demands of the crown and subjects of Spain: That this sum should be employed for the satisfaction, discharge, and payment of the demands of the British subjects upon the crown of Spain: That this reci∣procal discharge, however, should not extend or relate to the accounts and differences which subsisted and were to be settled between the crown of Spain and the assiento company, nor to any particular or private contracts that might subsist between either of the two crowns, or their ministers, with the subjects of the other; or between the subjects and subjects of each nation respectively: That his catholic majesty should cause the sum of ninety-five thousand pounds to be payed at London within four months, to be reckoned from the day on
<PB N="589" REF="5920"/>
which the ratifications were exchanged. Such was the substance of that con∣vention, which alarmed and provoked the merchants and traders of Great-Britain, excited the indignation of all those who retained any regard for the honour of their country, and raised a general cry against the minister who stood at the helm of administration.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The eyes of the whole kingdom were now turned upon the house of commons. The two contending parties summoned their whole force for the approaching dispute; and on the day appointed for considering the conven∣tion, four hundred members had taken their seats by eight in the morning. In a committee of the whole house, certain West-India merchants and planters were heard against the convention: so that this and the following day were em∣ployed in reading papers and obtaining information. On the eighth day of March Mr. H. Walpole having launched out in the praise of that agreement, moved for an address of approbation to his majesty. He was seconded by Mr. Campbel of Pembrokeshire; and the debate began with extraordinary ardour. He that first distinguished himself in the lists was Sir Thomas Sanderson, at that time treasurer to the prince of Wales, now earl of Scarborough. All the officers and adherents of his royal highness had joined the opposition; and he himself on this occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at in the gallery, to hear the debate on such an impor∣tant transaction. Sir Thomas Sanderson observed, that the Spaniards by the convention, instead of giving us reparation, had obliged us to give them a ge∣neral release. They had not allowed the word Satisfaction to be so much as once mentioned in the treaty. Even the Spanish pyrate who had cut off the ear of captain Jenkins <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Captain Jenkins was master of a Scottish merchant ship. He was boarded by the captain of a Spanish guarda costa, who treated him in the most barbarous manner. The Spaniards, after having rummaged his vessel for what they call contraband commodities, without finding any thing to justify their search, insulted Jenkins with the most opprobrious invectives; they tore off one of his ears, bidding him carry it to his king, and tell him, they would serve him in the same manner should an opportunity offer: they tortured him with the most shocking cruelty, and threatened him with immediate death. This man was examined at the bar of the house of commons, and being asked by a member, what he thought when he found himself in the hands of such barbarians? <Q>“I recommended my soul to God (said he) and my cause to my country.”</Q> The behaviour of this brave seaman, the sight of his ear, which was produced, with his account of the indignities which had been offered to the na∣tion and sovereign of Great-Britain, filled the whole house with indignation. Jenkins was after∣wards employed in the service of the East-India company: he approved himself worthy of his good fortune, in a long engagement with the pyrate Angria, during which he behaved with extraordinary courage and conduct; and saved his own ship with three others that were under his convoy.</NOTE>, and used the most insulting expression towards the person of the king; an expression which no British subject could decently re∣peat; an expression which no man that had a regard for his sovereign could ever forgive; even this fellow lived to enjoy the fruits of his rapine, and re∣mained a living testimony of the cowardly tameness and mean submission of Great-Britain; of the triumphant haughtiness, and stubborn pride of Spain. Lord Gage, one of the most keen, spirited, and sarcastic orators in the house, stated in his manner the account of the satisfaction obtained from the court of Spain by the convention. The losses sustained by the Spanish depredations amounted to three hundred and forty thousand pounds. The commissary, by a stroke of his pen, reduced this demand to two hundred thousand pounds; then forty-five thousand were struck off for prompt payment. He next alot∣ted
<PB N="590" REF="5930"/>
sixty thousand pounds as the remaining part of a debt pretended to be due to Spain, for the destruction of her fleet by Sir George Byng, though it appeared by the instructions on the table, that Spain had been already amply satisfied on that head. These deductions reduced the ballance to ninety-five thousand pounds; but the king of Spain insisted upon the South-sea company's paying immediately the sum of sixty-eight thousand pounds, as a debt due to him on one head of accounts, though in other articles his catholic majesty was in∣debted to the company a million over and above this demand. The remainder to be payed by Spain did not exceed seven and twenty thousand pounds, from which she insisted upon deducting whatever she might have already given in satisfac∣tion for any of the British ships that had been taken; and on being allowed the value of the St. Theresa, a Spanish ship which had been seized in the port of Dublin. Mr W. Pitt, with an energy of argument and diction peculiar to himself, declaimed against the convention, as insecure, unsatisfactory, and dis∣honourable to Great-Britain. He said, the great national objection, the search∣ing of British ships, was not omitted, indeed, in the preamble; but stood there as the reproach of the whole, as the strongest evidence of the fatal submission that followed: on the part of Spain, an usurpation, an inhuman tyranny claimed and exercised over the American seas: on the part of England, an undoubted right by treaties, and from God and nature declared and asserted in the resolu∣tions of parliament, were now referred to the discussion of plenipotentiaries, upon one and the same equal foot. This undoubted right was to be discussed and regulated; and if to regulate be to prescribe rules, as in all construction it is, that right was by the express words of the convention, to be given up and sa∣crificed; for, it must cease to be any thing from the moment it is submitted to limitation. Mr. Lyttleton, with equal force and fluency, answered the speech of Mr. H. Walpole. <Q>“After he had used many arguments to persuade us to peace, (said he) to any peace, good or bad, by pointing out the dangers of a war, dangers I by no means allow to be such as he represents them, he crown∣ed all those terrors with the name of the pretender. It would be the cause of the pretender. The pretender would come. Is the honourable gentle∣man sensible what this language imports? The people of England complain of the greatest wrongs and indignities: they complain of the interruption, the destruction of their trade: they think this peace has left them in a worse condition than before; and in answer to all these complaints, what are they told? Why, that their continuing to suffer all this, is the price they must pay to keep the king and his family on the throne of these realms. If this were true, it ought not to be owned; but it is far from truth: the very reverse is true. Nothing can weaken the family; nothing shake the establishment, but such measures as these, and such language as this.”</Q> He affirmed, that if the ministers had proceeded conformably to the intentions of parliament, they would either have acted with vigour, or have obtained a real security in an ex∣press acknowledgment of our right not to be searched, as a preliminary, fine qua non, to our treating at all. Instead of this they had referred it to plenipoten∣tiaries. <Q>“Would you, Sir, (said he) submit to a r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, wheth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r you may travel unmolested from your house in town to your house in the country? Your right is clear and undeniable, why would you have it discussed? but much less wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> you refer it, if two of your judges belonged to a gang which has often
<PB N="591" REF="5940"/>
stopped and robbed you in your way thither, before.”</Q> The ministers, in vindication of the convention, asserted, that the satisfaction granted by Spain was adequate to the injury received: that it was only the preliminary of a treaty that would remove all causes of complaint: that war was always expensive and detrimental to a trading nation, as well as uncertain in its events: that France and Spain would certainly join their forces in case of a rupture with Great-Britain: that there was not one power in Europe upon which the English could depend for effectual assistance: and, that war would favour the cause and de∣signs of a popish pretender. The house, upon a division, agreed to the address; but, when a motion was made for its being recommitted, the two parties re∣newed the engagement with redoubled eagerness and impetuosity. Sir William Wyndham and Mr. Pulteney poured all the thunder of their eloquence against the insolence of Spain, and the concessions of the British ministry. Sir Robert Walpole exerted all his fortitude and dexterity in defence of himself and his measures; and the question being put, the resolutions for the address were carried by a small majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="18" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XVIII.</HEAD>
<P>Then Sir William Wyndham standing up, made a pathetic re∣monstrance upon this determination. <Q>“This address (said he) is intended to convince mankind, that the treaty under our consideration is a reasonable and an honourable treaty. But if a majority of twenty-eight in such a full house should fail of that success; if the people should not implicitly resign their reason to a vote of this house, what will be the consequence? will not the parliament lose its authority? will it not be thought, that even in the parlia∣ment we are governed by a faction? and what the consequence of this may be, I leave to those gentlemen to consider, who are now to give their vote for this address; for my own part, I will trouble you no more; but, with these my last words, I sincerely pray to Almighty God, who has so often won∣derfully protected these kingdoms, that he will graciously continue his pro∣tection over them, by preserving us from that impending danger which threatens the nation from without, and likewise from that impending danger which threatens our constitution from within.”</Q> The minister was on this occasion deserted by his usual temper, and even provoked into personal abuse. He declared, that the gentleman who was now the mouth of his opponents, had been looked upon as the head of those traitors who twenty-five years be∣fore conspired the destruction of their country, and of the royal family, in order to set a popish pretender upon the throne: that he was seized by the vigilance of the then government, and pardoned by its clemency; but all the use he had ungratefully made of that clemency was to qualify himself according to law, that he and his party might some time or other have an opportunity to overthrow all law. He branded them all as traitors, and expressed his hope, that their behaviour would unite all the true friends of the present happy establishment. To such a degree of mutual animosity were both sides inflamed, that the most eminent members of the minority actually retired from parliament; and were by the nation in general re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered as martyrs to the liberty of the people.</P>

<P>The dispute occasioned by the convention in the house of lords was maintained with equal warmth, and perhaps with more abilities. After this famous treaty had been considered, lord Carteret suggested, that possibly one of the contracting powers had presented a protest or declaration, importing,
<PB N="592" REF="5950"/>
that she acceded to such or such a measure, only upon condition, that the terms of that protest or declaration should be made good. He said, that until his mind should be free from the most distant suspicion that such a paper might exist in the present case, he could not form a just opinion of the transaction himself, nor communicate to their lordships any light which might be necessary for that purpose. The adherents to the ministry endeavoured to evade his cu∣riosity in this particular, by general assertions; but he insisted on his suspicion with such perseverance, that at length the ministry produced the copy of a de∣claration made by the king of Spain before he ratified the convention, signify∣ing, That his catholic majesty reserved to himself, in its full force, the right of being able to suspend the assiento of negroes, in case the company should not pay within a short time the sum of sixty eight thousand pounds sterling, owing to Spain on the duty of negroes, or on the profit of the ship Caroline: That under the validity and force of this protest, the signing of the said con∣vention might be proceeded on, and in no other manner. In the debate that en∣sued, lord Carteret displayed a surprising extent of political knowledge, recom∣mended by all the graces of elocution, chaste, pure, dignified, and delicate. Lord Bathurst argued against the articles of convention with his usual spirit, integrity, and good sense, particularly animated by an honest indignation which the wrongs of his country had inspired. The earl of Chesterfield attacked this inglorious measure with all the weight of argument, and all the poignancy of satire. The duke of Argyle, no longer a partisan of the ministry, inv ighed against it as infamous, treacherous, and destructive, with all the fire, impetuo∣sity, and enthusiasm of declamation. It was defended with unequal arms by the duke of Newcastle, the earl of Cholmondley, the lord Hervey, the lord chancellor, the bishop of Salisbury, and in particular by the earl of Ilay, a no∣bleman of extensive capacity and uncommon erudition; remarkable for his knowledge of the civil law; and seemingly formed by nature for a politician; cool, discerning, plausible, artful, and enterprising; staunch to the minister, and invariably true to his own interest. The dispute was learned, long, and obsti∣nate; but ended as usual in the discomfiture of those who had stigmatized the treaty. The house agreed to an address, in which they thanked his majesty for his gracious condescension in laying before them the conven∣tion. They acknowledged his great prudence in bringing the demands of his subjects for their past losses, which had been so long depending, to a final adjustment; in procuring an express stipulation for a speedy payment; and in laying a foundation for accomplishing the great and desirable ends of obtaining future security, and preserving the peace between the two nations. They declared their confidence in his royal wisdom, that in the treaty to be concluded in pursuance of the convention, proper provisions would be made for the redress of the grievances of which the nation had so justly complained: They assured his majesty, that in case his just expectations should not be an∣swered, the house would heartily and zealously concur in all such measures as should be necessary to vindicate his majesty's honour, and to preserve to his subjects the full enjoyment of all those rights to which they were intituled by treaty and the law of nations. This was a hard-won victory. At the head of those who voted against the address we find the prince of Wales. His example was followed by six dukes, two and twenty earls, four viscounts, eighteen ba∣rons,
<PB N="593" REF="5960"/>
four bishops; and their party was reinforced by sixteen proxies. A spi∣rited<NOTE PLACE="marg">An.

<P>A message having been delivered to the house from his majesty, im∣porting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> That he had settled nine and thirty thousand pounds per annum on the younger children of the royal family; and desiring their lordships would bring in a bill to enable his majesty to make that provision good, out of the hereditary revenues of the crown; some lords in the opposition observed, that the next heir to the crown might look upon this settlement as a mortgage of his revenue, which a parliament had no power to make: that formerly no daughter of the royal family was ever provided for by parliament, except the eldest, and that never was by way of annuity, but an express provision of a determinate sum of money payed by way of dowry. The objections were over-ruled; and the house complied with his majesty's request. Then the duke of Newcastle pro∣duced a subsidy-treaty, by which his majesty obliged himself to pay to the king of Denmark seventy thousand pounds per annum, on condition of furnishing to his Britannic majesty a body of six thousand men, when demanded. At the same time his grace delivered a message from the king, desiring the house would enable him to fulfil this engagement; and also to raise what mone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and troops the exigency of affairs, during the approaching recess, might require. Another vehement dispute arose from this proposal. With respect to the treaty, lord Carteret observed, that no use could be made of the Danish troops in any ex∣pedition undertaken against Spain, because it was stipulated in the treaty, that they should not be used either in Italy or on board of the fleet, or be transported in whole or in part beyond sea, after they should have marched out of the ter∣ritories of Denmark, except for the defence of the kingdoms of Great-Britain and Ireland; nay, should France join against the English, the Danes could not act against that power or Spain, except as part of an army formed in Germany or Flanders. This body of Danes may be said, therefore, to have been retained for the defence and protection of Hanover: or, if the interest of Britain was at all consulted in the treaty, it must have been in preventing the Danes from joining their fleets to those of France and Spain. Then he argued against the second part of the message with great vivacity. He said, nothing could be more dan∣gerous to the constitution than a general and unlimited vote of credit. Such a demand our ancestors would have heard with amazement, and rejected with scorn. He affirmed, that the practice was but of modern date in England: that it was never heard of before the revolution; and never became frequent until the nation was blessed with the present wise administration. He said, if ever a general vote of credit and confidence should become a customary com∣pliment from the parliament to the crown at the end of every session, or as often as the minister might think fit to desire it, parliaments would grow despi∣cable in the eye<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the people; then a proclamation might be easily substituted in its stead, and happy would it be for the nation if that should be sufficient; for when a parliament ceases to be a check upon ministers, it becomes an useless and unnecessary burden on the people. The representatives must always be payed some way or other; if their wages are not payed openly and surely by their respective constituents, as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormerly, a majority of them, m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in fu∣ture
<PB N="594" REF="5970"/>
times be always ready to accept of wages from the administration, and these must come out of the pockets of the people. The duke of Argyle and the earl of Chesterfield enlarged upon the same topics. Nevertheless, the house complied with the message<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and presented an address, in which they not only ap∣proved of the treaty with Denmark, but likewise assured him they would con∣cur with his measures, and support him in fulfilling his engagements, as well as in making such further augmentation of his forces by sea and land, as he should think necessary for the honour, inter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and safety of these kingdoms.</P>

<P>The same message being communicated to the commons, they voted seventy thousand five hundred and eighty-three pounds for the subsidy to Denmark, and five hundred thousand pounds for augmenting the forces on any emergency. As Great-Britain stood engaged by the convention to pay to the crown of Spain the sum of sixty thousand pounds, in consideration of the ships taken and destroyed by Sir George Byng<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which sum was to be applied to the relief of the British merchants who had suffered by the Spanish depredations, the commons inserted in a bill a clause, providing for this sum to be payed by the parliament. When the bill was read in the house of lords, a motion was made by lord Bathurst for an address, to know, whether Spain had payed the money st<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pulated by the convention, as the time limited for the payment of it was now expired? The duke of Newcastle, by his majesty's permission, ac∣quainted the house, that it was not payed; and, that Spain had as yet given no reason for the non-payment. Then a day was appointed to consider the state of the nation, when lord Carter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t moved for a resolution, that the failure of Spain in this particular was a breach of the convention, an high indignity to his majesty, and an in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustice to the nation. But, after a warm debate, this mo∣tion was over-ruled by the majority. The minister, in order to atone in some measure for the unpopular step he had taken in the convention, allowed a salu∣tary law to pass for the encouragement of the woollen manufacture; and two bills in behalf of the sugar colonies, one permitting them, for a limited time, to export their produce directly to foreign parts, under proper restrictions, and the other making more effectual provisions for securing the duties layed upon the importation of foreign s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gars, rum, and molasses into Great-Britain, and his majesty's plantations in America.

<P>Letters of marque and reprisal were granted against the Spaniards; a promotion was made of general-officers; the troops were augmented; a

great fleet was assembled at Spithead; a reinforcement sent out to admiral Haddock; and an embargo layed on all merchant ships outward bound. Not∣withstanding these preparations of war, Mr. Keen, the British minister at Ma∣drid, declared to the court of Spain, that his master, although he had permitted his subjects to make reprisals, would not be understood to have broken the peace; and, that this permission would be recalled as soon as his catholic majesty should be disposed to make the satisfaction which had been so justly demanded. He was given to understand, that the king of Spain looked upon those repri∣sals as acts of hostility; and that he hoped, with the assistance of heaven and his allies, he should be able to support a good cause against his adversaries. He published a manifesto in justification of his own conduct, complaining, that ad∣miral Haddock had received orders to cruise with his squadron between the capes St. Vincent and St. Mary, in order to surprise the assogue ships; that letters of reprisal had been published at London, in an indecent style, and even carried into execution in different parts of the world. He excused his non-payment of the ninety-five thousand pounds stipulated in the convention, by affirming, that the British court had first contravened the articles of that treaty, by the orders sent to Haddock; by continuing to fortify Georgia; by reinforc∣ing the squadron at Jamaica; and by eluding the payment of the sixty-eight thousand pounds due to Spain from the South-sea company, on the assiento for negroes. The French ambassador at the Hague declared, that the king his master was obliged by treaties to assist his catholic majesty by sea and land, in case he should be attacked: he dissuaded the states-general from espousing the quarrel of Great-Britain; and they assured him they would observe a strict neu∣trality, though they could not avoid furnishing his Britannic majesty with such succours as he could demand, by virtue of the treaties subsisting between the two powers. The people of England were inspired with uncommon alacrity at the near prospect of war, for which they had so long clamoured; and the ministry seeing it unavoidable, began to be earnest and effectual in their preparations.</P>

<P>The events of war were still unfavourable to the emperor. He had bestowed the command of his army upon velt marechal count Wallis, who assembled his forces in the neighbourhood of Belgrade, and advanced towards Crotska, where he was attacked by the Turks with such impetuosity and perseve∣rance, that he was obliged to give ground, after a long and obstinate engage∣ment, in which he lost above six thousand men. The earl of Crawford, who served as a volunteer in the Imperial army, signalized his courage in an ex∣traordinary manner on this occasion, and received a dangerous wound, of which he never perfectly recovered. The Turks were afterwards worsted at Jabouka: nevertheless, their grand army invested Belgrade on the side of Servia, and car∣ried on the operations of the siege with extraordinary vigour. The emperor dreading the loss of this place, seeing his finances exhausted, and his army con∣siderably diminished, consented to a negotiatiation for peace, which was trans∣acted under the mediation of the French ambassador at the Ottoman Porte. The count de Neuperg, as Imperial plenipotentiary, signed the preliminaries on the first day of September. They were ratified by the emperor, though he pre∣tended to be dissatisfied with the articles; and declared, that his minister had

<P>A rupture between Great-Britain and Spain was now become inevi∣table. The English squadron in the Mediterranean had already made prize of two rich Caracca ships. The king had issued orders for augmenting his land∣forces, and raising a body of marines: and a great number of ships of war were put in commission. Admiral Vernon had been sent to the West-Indies, to assume the command of the squadron in those seas; and to annoy the trade and settlements of the Spaniards. This gentleman had rendered himself con∣siderable in the house of commons, by loudly condemning all the mea∣sures of the ministry, and bluntly speaking his sentiments, whatever they were, without respect of persons, and sometimes without any regard to decorum. He was counted a good officer, and this boisterous manner seemed to inhance his cha∣racter. As he had once commanded a squadron in Jamaica, he was perfectly well acquainted with those seas; and in a debate upon the Spanish depredations, he chanced to affirm, that Porto-Bello on the Spanish main might be easily taken: nay, he even undertook to reduce it with six ships only. This offer was ecchoed from the mouths of all the members in the opposition. Vernon was extolled as another Drake or Raleigh: he became the idol of a party, and his praise resounded from all corners of the kingdom. The minister, in order to appease the clamours of the people on this subject, sent him as commander in chief to the West-Indies. He was pleased with an opportunity to remove such a trou∣blesome censor from the house of commons; and perhaps, he was not without hope, that Vernon would disgrace himself and his party, by failing in the ex∣ploit he had undertaken. His catholic majesty having ordered all the British ships in his horbours to be seized and detained, the king of England would keep measures with him no longer, but denounced war against him on the twenty-third day of October. Many English merchants began to equip priva∣teers, and arm their trading vessels, to protect their own commerce as well as
<PB N="597" REF="6000"/>
to distress that of the enemy. The session of parliament was opened in Novem∣ber, when the king in his speech to both houses declared, that he had aug∣mented his sorces by sea and land, pursuant to the power vested in him by par∣liament for the security of his dominions, the protection of trade, and the an∣noyance of the enemy; and, he expressed his apprehension, that the heats and animosities which had been industriously fomented throughout the kingdom, encouraged Spain to act in such a manner as rendered it necessary for him to have recourse to arms. In answer to this speech, affectionate addresses were presented by both houses, without any considerable opposition.</P>

<P>The seceding members had again resumed their seats in the house of commons; and Mr. Pulteney thought proper to vindicate the extraordinary step which they had taken. He said, they thought it was necessary, as affairs then stood, for clearing their characters to posterity from the imputation of sit∣ting in an assembly where a determined majority gave a sanction to measures evidently to the disgrace of his majesty and the nation. He observed, that their conduct was so fully justified by the declaration of war against Spain, that any further vindication would be superfluous; for every assertion contained in it had been almost in the same words insisted upon by those who opposed the conven∣tion: <Q>“Every sentence in it (added he) is an echo of what was said in our rea∣sonings against that treaty: every positive truth which the declaration lays down, was denied with the utmost confidence by those who spoke for the convention; and, since that time, there has not one event happened which was not then foreseen and foretold.”</Q> He proposed, that in maintaining the war the Spanish settlements in the West-Indies should be attacked; and, that the ministry should not have the power to give up the conquests that might be made. He said, he heartily wished for his majesty's honour and service, that no mention had been made of heats and animosities in the king's speech; and gave it as his opinion, that they should take no notice of that clause in their address. He was answered by Sir Robert Walpole, who took occasion to say, he was in no great concern lest the service of his majes∣ty or the nation should suffer by the absence of those members who had quitted the house: he affirmed, the nation was generally sensible, that the many useful and popular acts which passed towards the end of the last session, were greatly forwarded and facilitated by the secession of those gentlemen; and, if they were returned only to oppose and perplex, he should not be at all sorry to see them secede again.</P>

<P>Mr. Pulteney revived the bill which he had formerly prepared for the encouragement of seamen. After a long dispute, and eager opposition by the ministry, it passed both houses, and obtained the royal assent. Mr. Sandys having observed, that there could be no immediate use for a great number of forces in the kingdom; and explained how little service could be expected from raw and undisciplined men, proposed an address to the king, desiring, that the body of marines should be composed of draughts from the old regiments: that as few officers should be appointed as the nature of the case would permit; and he expressed his hope, that the house would recommend this method to his majesty, in tender compassion to his people, already burthened with many heavy and grievous taxes. This scheme was repugnant to the intention of the mi∣nistry,
<PB N="5$8" REF="6010"/>
whose aim was to increase the number of their dependants, and extend their parliamentary interest by granting a great number of commissions. The motion was therefore, after a long debate, rejected by the majority. Motions were made for an inquiry into the conduct of those who concluded the conven∣tion; but, they were over-ruled. The pension-bill was revived, and so power∣fully supported by the eloquence of Sir William Wyndham, Mr. Pulteney, and Mr. Lyttleton, that it made its way through the commons to the upper house, where it was again lost, upon a division, after a very long debate. As the sea∣men of the kingdom expressed uncommon aversion to the service of the go∣vernment, and the fleet could not be manned without great difficulty, the mi∣nistry prepared a bill, which was brought in by Sir Charles Wager, for register∣ing all seamen, watermen, fishermen, and lightermen throughout his majesty's do∣minions. Had this bill passed into a law, a British sailor would have been reduced to the most object degree of slavery: had he removed from a certain district allotted for the place of his residence, he would have been deemed a deserter, and punished accordingly: he must have appeared, when summoned, at all ha∣zards, whatever might have been the circumstances of his family, or the state of his private affairs: had he been incumbered with debt, he must either have incurred the penalties of this law, or lain at the mercy of his creditors: had he acquired by industry, or received by inheritance, an ample fortune, he would have been liable to be torn from his possessions, and subjected to hardships which no man would endure but from the sense of fear or indigence. The bill was so vigorously opposed by Sir John Barnard and others, as a flagrant in∣croachment on the liberties of the people, that the house rejected it on the se∣cond reading.</P>

<P>The king having by message communicated to the house his in∣tention of disposing the princess Mary in marriage to prince Frederick of Hesse; and expressing his hope, that the commons would enable him to give a suitable portion to his daughter; they unanimously resolved to grant forty thousand pounds for that purpose; and presented an address of thanks to his majesty, for having communicated to the house this intended marriage. On the thirteenth day of March a ship arrived from the West-Indies, dispatched by admiral Vernon, with an account of his having taken Porto-Bello, on the isthmus of Darien, with six ships only, and demolished all the fortifications of the place. The Spaniards acted with such pusillanimity on this occasion, that their forts were taken almost without bloodshed. The two houses of parliament joined in an address of congratulation upon this success of his majesty's arms; and the nation in general was wonderfully elated by an exploit which was magnified much above its merit. The commons granted every thing the crown thought proper to demand. They provided for eight and twenty thousand land-forces, besides six thousand marines. They enabled his majesty to equip a very power∣ful navy: they voted the subsidy to the king of Denmark; and they im∣powered their sovereign to defray certain extraordinary expences not specified in the estimates. To answer these uncommon grants, they imposed a land-tax of four shillings in the pound; and enabled his majesty to deduct twelve hun∣dred thousand pounds from the sinking fund: in a word, the expence of the war, during the course of the ensuing year, amounted to about four millions.

<P>During the greatest part of this winter, the poor had been griev∣ously afflicted in consequence of a severe frost, which began at Christmas and continued till the latter end of February. The river Thames was covered with such a crust of ice, that a multitude of people dwelled upon it in tents, and a great number of booths were erected for the entertainment of the popu∣lace. The navigation was entirely stopped: the watermen and fishermen were disabled from earning a livelihood: the fruits of the earth were destroyed by the cold, which was so extreme, that many persons were chilled to death; and this calamity was the more deeply felt, as the poor could not afford to supply themselves with coals and fuel, which were advanced in price in pro∣portion to the severity and continuance of the frost. The lower class of la∣bourers, who worked in the open air, were now deprived of all means of sub∣sistence: many kinds of manufacture were layed aside, because it was found impracticable to carry them on. The price of all sorts of provision rose al∣most to a dearth: even water was sold in the streets of London. In this season of distress, many wretched families must have perished by cold and hunger, had not those of opulent fortunes been inspired with a remarkable spirit of compassion and humanity. Nothing can more redound to the honour of the English nation, than did those instances of benevolence and well con∣ducted charity which were then exhibited. The liberal hand was not only opened to the professed beggar, and the poor that owned their distress: but un∣common pains were taken to find out and relieve those more unhappy objects that from motives of false pride, or ingenuous shame, endeavoured to conceal their misery. These were assisted almost in their own despite. The solitary habita∣tions of the widow, the fatherless, and the unfortunate, were visited by the beneficent, who felt for the woes of their fellow-creatures; and, to such as re∣fused to receive a portion of the public charity, the necessaries of life were privately conveyed in such a manner as could least shock the delicacy of their disposi∣tions.</P>

<P>In the beginning of May, the king of Great-Britain set out for<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1740.</NOTE> Hanover, after having appointed a regency, and concerted vigorous measures for distressing the enemy. In a few days after his departure, the spousals of the princess Mary were celebrated by proxy; the duke of Cumberland repre∣senting the prince of Hesse; and in June the princess embarked for the con∣tinent. About the same time a sloop arrived in England with dispatches from admiral Vernon, who, since his adventure at Porto-Bello, had bombarded Carthagena, and taken the fort of San Lorenzo, on the river of Chagre, in the neighbourhood of his former conquest. This month was likewise marked by the death of his Prussian majesty, a prince by no means remarkable for great or amiable qualities. He was succeeded on the throne by Frederick his eldest son, the reigning king of that realm, who has so eminently distinguished himself as a warrior and legislator. In August the king of Great-Britain concluded a treaty with the landgrave of Hesse, who engaged to furnish him with a body of six thousand men for four years, in consideration of an annual subsidy of two hundred and fifty thousand crowns.</P>

<P>Mean while, preparations of war were vigorously carried on by the ministry in England. They had wisely resolved to annoy the Spaniards in their American p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ns. Three ships of war cruising in the bay of Biscay, f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll in with a large Spanish shrp of the line strongly manned, and took her after a very obstinate engagement: but the assogue ships arrived, with the treasure, in Spain, notwithstanding the vigilance of the English commanders, who were stationed in a certain latitude to intercept that slota. One camp was formed on Hounslow heath; and the six thousand marines lately levied were encamped on the isle of Wight, in order to be embarked for the West-Indies. Intelligence being received that a strong squadron of Spanish ships of war waited at Ferrol for orders to sail to their American settlements, Sir John Norris sailed with a powerful fleet from Spithead, to dispute their voyage; and the duke of Cumberland served in person as a volunteer in this expedition: but, after divers fruitless efforts, he was by contrary winds obliged to lie inactive for the greatest part of the summer in Torbay; and, upon advice that the French and Spanish squadrons had sailed to the West-Indies in conjunction, the design against Ferrol was wholly layed aside. In September, a small squa∣dron of ships, commanded by commodore Anson, set sail for the South-sea, in order to act against the enemy on the coast of Chili and Peru, and co-operate occasionally with admiral Vernon across the isthmus of Darien. The scheme was well layed, but ruined by unnecessary delays, and unforeseen ac∣cidents. But the hopes of the nation centered chiefly in a formidable arma∣ment designed for the northern coast of New Spain, and his catholic majesty's other settlements on that side of the Atlantic. Commissions had been issued for raising a regiment of four battalions in the English colonies of North-America, that they might be transported to Jamaica, and join the forces from England. These, consisting of the marines, and detachments from some old regiments, were embarked in October at the isle of Wight, under the command of lord Cathcart, a nobleman of approved honour, and great experience in the art of war; and they sailed under convoy of Sir Chaloner Ogle, with a fleet of seven and twenty ships of the line, besides frigates, fire-ships, bomb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ketches, and tenders. They were likewise furnished with hospital-ships, and store-ships loaded with provision, ammunition, all sorts of warli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e implements, and every kind of conveni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce.

<P>The king of Great-Britain having returned to England from his German dominions, the session of parliament was opened in November. His majesty assured them, on this occasion, that he was determined to pro∣secute the war vigorously, even though France should espouse the cause of Spain, as her late conduct seemed to favour this supposition. He took notice of the emperor's death, as an event which in all likelihood would open a new scene of affairs in Europe; he therefore recommended to their consideration, the necessary supplies for putting the nation in such a posture that it should have nothing to fear from any emergency. Finally, he desired them to con∣sider of some proper regulations for preventing the exportation of corn, and for more effectual methods to man the fleet at this conjuncture. The com∣mons, after having voted an address of thanks, brought in a bill for pro∣hibiting the exportation of corn and provisions, for a limited time, out of Great-Britain, Ireland, and the American plantations. This was a measure calculated to distress the enemy, who were supposed to be in want of these ne∣cessaries. The French had contracted for a very large quantity of beef and pork in Ireland, for the use of their own and of the Spanish navy; and an em∣bargo had been layed upon the ships of that kingdom. This bill met with a vigorous opposition; yet the house unanimously resolved, that his majesty should be addressed to lay an immediate embargo upon all the ships laden with corn, grain, starch, rice, beef, pork, and other provisions, to be exported to foreign parts. They likewise resolved, that the thanks of the house should be given to vice-admiral Vernon, for the services he had done to his king and country in the West-Indies. One William Cooley was examined at the bar of the house, and committed to prison, after having owned himself author of a paper intituled, "Considerations upon the embargo on provision of victual." The performance contained many shrewd and severe animadversions upon the go∣vernment, for having taken a step which, without answering the purpose of distressing the enemy, would prove a grievous discouragement to trade, and ruin all the graziers of Ireland. Notwithstanding the arguments used in this remonstrance, and several petitions that were presented against the corn-bill, it passed by meer dint of ministerial influence. The other party endeavoured, by various <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otions, to set on foot an inquiry into the orders, letters, and in∣structions, which had been sent to admiral Vernon and admiral Haddock: but all such investigations were carefully avoided.</P>

<DIV4 N="33" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>A very hot contest arose from a bill which the ministry brought in under the specious title of, A bill for the encouragement and increase of sea∣men, and for the better and speedier manning his majesty's fleet. This was a revival of the oppressive scheme which had been rejected in the former session;
<PB N="602" REF="6050"/>
a scheme by which the justices of the peace were empowered to issue war∣rants to constables and headboroughs, to search by day of night for such sea∣faring men as should conceal themselves within their respective jurisdictions. Those searchers were vested with authority to force open doors, in case of re∣sistance; and encouraged to this violence by a reward for every seaman they should discover; while the unhappy wretches so discovered were dragged into the service, and their names entered in a register to be kept at the navy or the admiralty-office. Such a plan of tyranny did not pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s uncensured. Every excep∣tionable clause produced a warm debate, in which Sir John Barnard, Mr. Pulteney, Mr. Sandys, lord Gage, Mr. Pitt, and Mr. Lyttleton, signalized themselves nobly in defending the liberties of their fellow-subjects. Mr. Pitt having expressed a laudable indignation at such a large stride towards despotic power, in justifica∣tion of which nothing could be urged but the plea of necessity, Mr. H. Wal∣pole thought proper to attack him with some personal sarcasms. He reflected upon his youth; and observed, that the discovery of truth was very little pro∣moted by pompous diction and theatrical emotion. These insinuations exposed him to a severe reply. Mr. Pitt standing up again, said, he would not un∣dertake to determine whether youth could be justly imputed to any man as a reproach: but he affirmed, that the wretch, who, after having seen the conse∣quences of repeated errors, continues still to blunder, and whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his grey head should secure him from insults: much more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with less temptation; who prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy; and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country. Petitions were presented from the city of Lon∣don, and county of Gloucester, against the bill, as detrimental to the trade and navigation of the kingdom, by discouraging rather than encouraging sailors, and destructive to the liberties of the subject: but they were both rejected, as insults upon the house of commons. After very long debates maintained on both sides with extraordinary ardour and emotion, the severe clauses were dropped, and the bill passed with amendments.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIV.</HEAD>
<P>But the most remarkable incident of this session was an open and personal attack upon the minister, who was become extremely unpopular all over the kingdom. The people were now more than ever sensible of the grievous taxes under which they groaned; and saw their burdens daily in∣creasing. No effectual attempt had as yet been made to annoy the enemy. Ex∣pensive squadrons had been equipped; had made excursions and returned without striking a blow. The Spanish fleet had sailed first from Cadiz, and then from Ferrol, without any interruption from admiral Haddock, who commanded the British squadron in the Mediterranean, and who was supposed to be re∣stricted by the instructions he had received from the ministry, though in fact his want of success was owing to accident. Admiral Vernon had written from the West-I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es to his private friends, that he was neglected, and in danger of being sacrificed. Notwithstanding the numerous navy which the nation maintained, the Spanish privateers made prize of the British merchant-ships with impunity. In violation of treaties, and in contempt of that intimate connection which had been so long cultivated between the French and English ministry,
<PB N="603" REF="6060"/>
the king of France had ordered the harbour and fortifications of Dunkirk to be repaired: his fleet had sailed to the West-Indies, in conjunction with that of Spain; and the merchants of England began to tremble for Jamaica: finally, commerce was in a manner suspended, by the practice of pressing sailors into the service, and by the embargo which had been layed upon ships in all the ports of Great-Britain and Ireland. These causes of popular discon∣tent, added to other complaints which had been so long repeated against the minister, exaggerated and inculcated by his enemies with unwearied industry, at length rendered him so universally odious, that his name was seldom or never mentioned with decency, except by his own dependants.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>The country-party in parliament seized this opportunity of ven∣geance. Mr. Sandys went up to Sir Robert Walpole in the house, and told him, that on Friday next he should bring a charge against him in public. The minister seemed to be surprised at this unexpected intimation; but, after a short pause, thanked him politely for this previous notice, and said, he desired no favour, but fair play <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Upon this occasion he misquoted Horace. <Q>“As I am not conscious of any crime, (said he) I do not doubt of being able to make a pro∣per defence. Nil conscire sibi nulli pallescere culpae.”</Q> He was corrected by Mr. Pulteney; but insisted upon his being in the right, and actually laid a wager of a guinea on the justness of his quotation.</NOTE>. Mr. Sandys, at the time which he had appointed for this accusation, stood up, and in a studied speech entered into a long deduc∣tion of the minister's misconduct. He insisted upon the discontents of the nation at the measures which had been for many years pursued at home and abroad. He professed his belief that there was not a gentleman in the house who did not know, that one single person in the administration was the chief, if not the sole adviser and promoter, of all those measures. <Q>“This (added he) is known without doors as well as within; therefore the discontents, the reproaches, and even the curses of the people, are all directed against that single person. They complain of present measures; they have suffered by past measures; they expect no redress; they expect no alteration or amendment, whilst he has a share in directing or advising our future administration. These, Sir, are the sentiments of the people in regard to that minister: these senti∣ments we are in honour and duty bound to represent to his majesty; and the proper method for doing this, as established by our constitution, is to address his majesty to remove him from his councils.”</Q> He then proceeded to explain the particulars of the minister's misconduct in the whole series of his negotiations abroad. He charged him with having endeavoured to support his own interest, and to erect a kind of despotic government, by the practice of corruption; with having betrayed the interest and honour of Great-Britain in the late convention; with having neglected to prosecute the war against Spain; and he concluded with a motion for an address to the king, that he would be pleased to remove Sir Robert Walpole from his presence and councils for ever. He was answered by Mr. Pelham, who undertook to defend or excuse all the mea∣sures which the other had condemned; and acquitted himself as a warm friend and unshaken adherent. Against this champion Sir John Barnard entered the lists, and was sustained by Mr. Pulteney, who, with equal spirit and pre∣cision,
<PB N="604" REF="6070"/>
pointed out and exposed all the material errors and mal-practices of the administration. Sir Robert Walpole spoke with great temper and delibera∣tion in behalf of himself. With respect to the article of bribery and cor∣ruption, he said, if any one instance had been mentioned; if it had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hewn that he ever offered a reward to any member of either house, or ever threatened to deprive any member of his office or employment, in order to in∣fluence his voting in parliament, there might have been some ground for this charge; but, when it was so generally layed, he did not know what he could say to it, unless to deny it as generally and as positively as it had been as∣serted. Such a declaration as this, in the hearing of so many persons, who not only knew, but sub<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sted by his wages of corruption, was a strong proof of the minister's being dead to all sense of shame, and all regard to veracity<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The debate was protracted by the court-members till three o'clock in the morn∣ing, when above sixty of the opposite party having retired, the motion was re∣jected by a considerable majority.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="36" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXXVI.</HEAD>
<P>A bill was brought in for prohibiting the practice of insuring ships belonging to the enemies of the nation; but it was vigorously opposed by Sir John Barnard and Mr. Willimot, who demonstrated that this kind of traffic was advantageous to the kingdom; and the scheme was dropped. An∣other warm contest aro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e upon a clause of the mutiny<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bill relating to the quartering of soldiers upon inn-keepers and publicans, who complained of their being distressed in furnishing those guests with provisions and necessaries at the rates prescribed by law or custom. There were not wanting advocates to expatiate upon the nature of this grievance, which however was not re∣dressed. A new trade was at this time opened with Persia, through the do∣minions of the czar, and vested with an exclusive privilege in the Russia com∣pany, by an act of parliament. The commons voted forty thousand seamen for the service of the ensuing year, and about thirty thousand men for the etablishment of land-forces. They provided for the subsidies granted to the king of Denmark and the landgrave of Hesse Cassel; and took every step which was suggested for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase and convenience of the government.</P>

<P>The parties in the house of lords were influenced by the same motives which actuated the commons. The duke of Argyle, who had by this time resigned all his places, declared open war against the ministry. In the be∣ginning of the sess<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, the king's speech was no sooner reported by the chan∣cellor, than this nobleman stood up and moved, that a general address of thanks s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> presented to his majesty, instead of a recapitulation of every para∣graph o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the king's speech, re echoed from the parliament to the throne, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nd approbation, implying a general concurrence with all the measures of the minister.

success; and, in the debates which ensued, the young earls of Hallifax and Sandwich acquired a considerable share of reputation, for the strength of ar∣gument and elocution with which they contended against the adherents of the ministry. When the house took into consideration the state of the army, the duke of Argyle having harrangued with equal skill and energy on military af∣fairs, proposed that the sorces should be augmented by adding new levies to the old companies, without increasing the number of officers; a practice that served only to debase the dignity of the service, by raising the lowest of man∣kind to the rank of gentlemen; and to extend the influence of the minister, by multiplying his dependents. He therefore moved for a resolution, that the augmenting the army by raising regiments, as it is the most unnecessary and most expensive method of augmentation, is also the most dangerous to the liberties of the nation. This proposal was likewise over-ruled, after a short though warm contention. This was the fate of all the other motions made by the lords in the opposition; though the victory of the courtiers was always clogged with a nervous and spirited protest. Two days were expended in the debate produced by lord Carteret's motion for an address, beseeching his ma∣jesty to remove. Sir Robert Walpole from his presence and councils for ever. The speech that ushered in this memorable motion would not have disgraced a Cicero. It contained a retrospect of all the public measures which had been pursued since the revolution. It explained the nature of every treaty, whether right or wrong, which had been concluded under the present administration. It described the political connexions subsisting between the different powers in Europe. It exposed the weakness, the misconduct, and the iniquity of the minister, both in his foreign and domestic transactions. It was embellished with all the ornaments of rhetoric, and warmed with a noble spirit of patriot indignation. The duke of Argyle, the lord Bathurst, and his other colleagues, seemed to be animated with uncommon fervour, and even inspired, by the sub∣ject. A man of imagination, in reading their speeches, will think himself<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1741.</NOTE> transported into the Roman senate, before the ruin of that republic. Never∣theless, the minister still triumphed by dint of number; though his victory was dearly purchased. Thirty peers entered a vigorous protest; and Walpole's character sustained such a rude shock from this opposition, that his authority seemed to be drawing near a period. Immediately after this contest was de∣cided, the duke of Marlborough moved for a resolution, that any attempt to inflict any kind of punishment on any person, without allowing him an op∣portunity to make his defence, or without any proof of any crime or misde∣meanour committed by him, is contrary to natural justice, the fundamental laws of the realm, and the antient established usage of parliament; and is a high infringement of the liberties of the subject. It was seconded by the duke of Devonshire and the lord Lovel; and opposed by lord Gower, as an intended censure on the proceedings of the day. This sentiment was so warmly espoused by lord Talbot, who had distinguished himself in the former debate, that he seemed to be transported beyond the bounds of moderation. He was inter∣rupted by the earl of Cholmondely, who charged him with having violated the order and decorum which ought to be preserved in such an assembly. His passion was inflamed by this rebuke: he declared himself an independent lord; a character which he would not forfeit for the smiles of a court, the profit of
<PB N="606" REF="6090"/>
an employment, or the reward of a pension: he said, when he was engaged on the side of truth, he would trample on the insolence that should command him to suppress his sentiments. On a division, however, the motion was carried.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>In the beginning of April, the king repairing to the house of peers, passed some acts that were ready for the royal assent. Then, in his speech to both houses, he gave them to understand, that the queen of Hun∣gary had made requisition of the twelve thousand men stipulated by treaty; and that he had ordered the subsidy-troops of Denmark and Hesse-Cassel to be in readiness to march to her assistance. He observed, that in this compli∣cated and uncertain state of affairs, many incidents might arise, and render it necessary for him to incur extraordinary expences for maintaining the prag∣matic sanction, at a time when he could not possibly have recourse to the ad∣vice and assistance of his parliament. He therefore demanded of the com∣mons such a supply as might be requisite for these ends; and promised to manage it with all possible frugality. The lower house, in their address, approved of all his measures; declared they would effectually support him against all insults and attacks that might be made upon any of his territories, though not belonging to the crown of Great-Britain; and that they would enable him to contribute, in the most effectual manner, to the support of the queen of Hungary. Sir Robert Walpole moved, that an aid of two hundred thousand pounds should be granted to that princess. Mr. Shippen protested against any interposition in the affairs of Germany. He expressed his dis∣like of the promise which had been made to defend his majesty's foreign do∣minions; a promise, in his opinion, inconsistent with that important and inviolable law, the act of settlement; a promise which, could it have been foreknown, would perhaps have for ever precluded from the suc∣cession that illustrious family to which the nation owed such numberless bles∣sings, such continued felicity. The motion however passed, though not without further opposition; and the house resolved, that three hundred thou∣sand pounds should be granted to his majesty, to enable him effectually to sup∣port the queen of Hungary. Towards the expence of this year, a million was deducted from the sinking-fund; and the land-tax continued at four shillings in the pound. The preparations for this war had already cost five millions. The session was closed on the twenty-fifth day of April, when the king took his leave of this parliament, with warm expressions of tenderness and satis∣faction. Henry Bromley, Stephen Fox, and John Howe, three members of the lower house, who had signalized themselves in defence of the minister, were now enobled, and created barons of Montfort, Ilchester, and Chedworth. A camp was formed near Colchester; and the king having appointed a re∣gency, set out in May for his German dominions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir William Wyndham died in the preceding year, deeply regreted as an orator, a patriot, and a man, the constant assertor of British liberty, and one of the chief ornaments of the English na∣tion. In the course of the same year, general Oglethorpe, governor of Georgia, had, with some succours obtained from the colony of Carolina, and a small squadron of the king's ships, made an attempt upon fort Augustine, the capital of Spanish Florida; and actually reduced some small forts in the neighbourhood of the place: but the Carolinians withdrawing in disgust, dissensions prevailing among the sea-officers, the hurricane months approaching, and the enemy having re∣ceived a supply and reinforcement, he abandoned the enterprize, and returned to Georgia.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>THE British armament had by this time proceeded to action in the West-Indies. Sir Chaloner Ogle, who sailed from Spithead, had been overtaken by a tempest in the bay of Biscay, by which the fleet, consist∣ing of about one hundred and seventy sail, were scattered and dispersed. Nevertheless, he prosecuted his voyage, and anchored with a view to provide wood and water, in the neutral island of Dominica, where the intended expe∣dition

<P>In the mean time Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jamaica, where he joined vice-admiral Vernon, who now found himself at the head of the most <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>midable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eet and army that ever visited those seas, with full power to act at di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>non. The conjoined squadrons consisted of nine and twenty ships of the line<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with almost an equal number of frigates, fireships, and bomb ketches, well manned<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and plentifully supplied with all kinds of provisions, stores, and n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cessaries. The number of seamen amounted to fifteen thousand: that of the land-forces, including the American regiment of four battalions, and a body o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> negroes in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted at Jamaica, did not fall short of twelve thousand. Had this armament been ready to act in the proper season of the year, under the conduct of wise experienced officers, united in councils, and steadily attached to the inte∣rest and honour of their country, the Havannah, and whole island of Cuba might have been easily reduced; the whole treasure of the Spanish West-Indies would have been intercepted; and Spain must have been humbled into the most abject submission. But several unfavourable circumstances concurred to frustrate the hopes of the public. The ministry had detained Sir Chaloner Ogle at Spithead, without any visible cause, until the season for action was al∣most exhausted: for, on the continent of New Spain, the periodical rains begin about the end of April; and this change in the atmosphere is always attended with epidemical distempers, which render the climate extremely unhealthy: be∣sides, the rain is so excessive, that for the space of two months no army can keep the field.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ III.</HEAD>
<P>Sir Chaloner Ogle arrived at Jama<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ca on the ninth day of January; and admiral Vernon did not sail on his intended expedition till towards the end of the month. Instead of directing his course to the Havannah, which lay to leeward, and might have been reached in less than three days, he resolved to beat up against the wind to Hispan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ola, in o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>der to observe the motion of the French squadron, commanded by the m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rquis de Antin. The fifteenth day of February had elapsed before he received certain information that the French admiral had sailed for Europe in great distress, for want of men and provisions,
<PB N="609" REF="6120"/>
which he could not procure in the West-Indies. Admiral Vernon thus disap∣pointed, called a council of war, in which it was determined to proceed for Car∣thagena. The fleet being supplied with wood and water at Hispaniola, set sail for the continent of New-Spain, and on the fourth of March anchored in Playa Grande, to the windward of Carthagena. Admiral de Torres had al∣ready sailed to the Havannah; but the place was strongly fortified, and the garrisons reinforced by the crews of a small squadron of large ships, commanded by Don Blas de Leso, an officer of experience and reputation. There they lay inactive till the ninth, when the troops were landed on the island of Tierra Bomba, near the mouth of the harbour, known by the name of Boca-chica, or Little-mouth, which was surprisingly fortified with castles, batteries, booms, chains, cables, and ships of war. The British forces erected a battery on shore, with which they made a breach in the principal fort, while the admiral sent in a number of ships to divide the fire of the enemy, and co-operate with the endeavours of the army. Lord Aubrey Beauclerc, a gallant officer, who commanded one of these ships, was slain on this occasion. The breach being deemed practicable, the forces advanced to the attack: but, the forts and bat∣teries were abandoned; the Spanish ships that lay athwart the harbour's mouth, were destroyed or taken; the passage was opened, and the fleet entered without further opposition. Then the forces were reimbarked with the artillery, and landed within a mile of Carthagena, where they were opposed by about seven hundred Spaniards, whom they obliged to retire. The admiral and general had contracted a hearty contempt for each other, and took all opportunities of expressing their mutual dislike: far from acting vigorously in concert, for the advantage of the community, they maintained a mutual reserve, and separate cabals; and each proved more eager for the disgrace of his rival, than zealous for the honour of the nation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IV.</HEAD>
<P>The general complained that the fleet lay idle, while his troops were harrassed and diminished by hard duty and distemper. The admiral affirmed, that his ships could not lie near enough to batter the town of Carthagena; and up∣braided the general with inactivity and want of resolution to attack the fort of St. Lazar, which commanded the town, and might be taken by scalade. Went∣worth, stimulated by these reproaches, resolved to try the experiment. His forces marched up to the attack; but the guides being slain, they mistook their route, and advanced to the strongest part of the fortification, where they were moreover exposed to the fire of the town. Colonel Grant, who commanded the grenadi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, was mortally wounded: the scaling-ladders were found too short; the officers were perplexed for want of orders and directions: yet the soldiers sus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ined a severe fire for several hours with surprising intrepidity, and at length re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reated, leaving about six hundred killed or wounded on the spot. Their number was now so much reduced, that they could no longer maintain their footing on shore: besides, the rainy season had begun with such violence, as rendered it impossible for them to live in camp. They were therefore reimbarked; and all hope of further success immediately vanished. The admiral, however, in order to demonstrate the impracticability of taking the place by sea, sent in the Gallicia, one of the Spanish ships which had been taken at Boca-chica, to cano∣nade the town, with sixteen guns mounted on one side, like a floating batte∣ry. This vessel, manned by detachments of volunteers from different ships,
<PB N="610" REF="6130"/>
and commanded by captain Hore, was warped into the inner harbour, and moored before day, at a considerable distance from the walls, and in very shal∣low water. In this position she stood the fire of several batteries for some hours, without doing or sustaining much damage: then the admiral ordered the men to be brought off in boats, and the cables to be cut; so that she drove with the sea-breeze upon a shoal, where she was soon filled with water. This exploit was absurd, and the inference which the admiral drew from it, altogether fa∣lacious. He said, it plainly proved, that there was not depth of water in the inner harbour, sufficient to admit large ships near enough to batter the town, with any prospect of success. This indeed was the case in that part of the har∣bour, to which the Gallicia was conducted; but a little farther to the left, he might have stationed four or five of his largest ships a-breast, within pistol-shot of the walls: and if this step had been taken, when the land-forces marched to the attack of St. Lazar, in all probability the town would have been surren∣dered.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ V.</HEAD>
<P>After the reimbarkation of the troops, the distempers peculiar to the climate and season began to rage with redoubled fury; and great numbers of those who escaped the vengeance of the enemy, perished by a more painful and inglorious sate. Nothing was heard but complaints and execrations: the groans of the dying, and the service for the dead; nothing was seen but objects of woe, and images of dejection. The conductors of this unfortunate expedition agreed in nothing but the expediency of a speedy retreat from this scene of mi∣sery and disgrace. The fortifications of the harbour were demolished, and the fleet returned to Jamaica. The miscarriage of this expedition, which had cost the nation an immense sum of money, was no sooner known in England, than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and discontent, and the people were de∣pressed, in proportion to that sanguine hope by which they had been elevated. Admiral Vernon, instead of undertaking any enterprize which might have retrieved the honour of the British arms, set sail from Jamaica with the forces in July, and anchored at the south-east part of Cuba, in a bay, on which he bestowed the appellation of Cumberland harbour. The troops were landed, and encamped at the distance of twenty miles farther up the river, where they remained totally inactive, and subsisted chiefly on salt and damaged provisions, till the month of November, when, being considerably diminished by sickness, they were put on board again, and reconveyed to Jamaica. He was afterwards reinforced from England by four ships of war, and about three thousand sol∣diers; but, he performed nothing worthy of the reputation he had acquired; and the people began to perceive that they had mistaken his character.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="6" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VI.</HEAD>
<P>The affairs on the continent of Europe were now more than even embroiled. The king of Prussia had demanded of the court of Vienna part of Silesia, by virtue of old treaties of co-fraternity, which were either obsolete or annulled; and promised to assi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the queen with all his forces, in case she should eomply with his demand: but this being rejected with disdain, he entered Silesia at the head of an army, and prosecuted his conquests with great rapidi∣ty. In the mean time the queen of Hungary was crowned at Presburg, after having signed a capitulation, by which the liberties of that kingdom were con∣formed; and the grand duke her consort was, at her request, associated with her for ten years in the government. At the same time the states of Hungary
<PB N="611" REF="6140"/>
refused to receive a memorial from the elector of Bavaria. During these tran∣sactions, his Prussian majesty made his public entrance into Breslau, and con∣firmed all the privileges of the inhabitants. One of his generals surprised the town and fortress of Jablunka, on the confines of Hungary; prince Leo∣pold of Anhalt-Dessau, who commanded another army, which formed the blockade of Great Glogau on the Oder, took the place by scalade, made the generals Wallis and Reyski prisoners, with a thousand men that were in garri∣son; and here he found the military chest, fifty pieces of brass cannon, and a great quantity of ammunition.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="7" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VII.</HEAD>
<P>The queen of Hungary had solicited the maritime powers for assist∣ance, but found them fearful and backward. Being obliged, therefore, to ex∣ert herself with the more vigour, she ordered count Neuperg to assemble a body of forces, and endeavour to stop the progress of the Prussians in Silesia. The two armies encountered each other in the neighbourhood of Niess, at a village called Molwitz; and, after an obstinate dispute, the Austrians were obliged to retire, with the loss of four thousand men killed, wounded, or taken. The advantage was dearly purchased by the king of Prussia. His kinsman Frede∣ric, margrave of Brandenburgh, and lieutenant-general Schuylemberg were killed in the engagement, together with a great number of general officers, and about two thousand soldiers. After this action, Brieg was surrendered to the victor, and he forced the important pass of Fryewalde, which was defended by four thousand Austrian hussars. The English and Dutch ministers, who ac∣companied him in his progress, spared no pains to effect an accommodation: but the two sovereigns were too much irritated against each other, to acquiesce in any terms that could be proposed. The queen of Hungary was incensed to find herself attacked, in the day of her distress, by a prince to whom she had given no sort of provocation; and his Prussian majesty charged the court of Vienna with a design either to assassinate, of carry him off by treachery: a de∣sign which was disowned with expressions of indignation and disdain. Count Neuperg being obliged to abandon Silesia, in order to oppose the Bavarian arms in Bohemia, the king of Prussia sent thither a detachment to join the elec∣tor, under the command of count Deslau, who, in his route, reduced Glatz and Neiss, almost without opposition: then his master received the homage of the Silesian states at Breslau, and returned to Berlin. In December, the Prussian army was distributed in winter-quarters in Moravia, after having taken Olmutz, the capital of that province; and, in March, his Prussian majesty formed a camp of observation in the neighbourhood of Magdeburg.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="8" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>The elector of Hanover was alarmed at the success of the king of Prussia, in apprehension that he would become too formidable a neighbour. A scheme was said to have been proposed to the court of Vienna, for attacking that prince's electoral dominions, and dividing the conquest: but it never was put in execution. Nevertheless, the troops of Hanover were augmented; the auxiliary Danes and Hessians in the pay of Great Britain were ordered to be in readiness to march, and a number of British forces encamped and prepared for embarkation. The subsidy of three hundred thousand pounds, granted by parliament, was remitted to the queen of Hungary; and every thing seemed to presage the vigorous interposition of his Britannic majesty. But in a little time after his arrival at Hanover, that spirit of action seemed to flag, even
<PB N="612" REF="6150"/>
while her Hungarian majesty to tottered on the verge of ruin. France re∣solved to seize this opportunity of crushing the house of Austria. In order to intimidate the elector of Hanover, marechal Mallebois was sent with a nume∣rous army into Westphalia; and this expedient proved effectual. A treaty of neutrality was concluded; and the king of Great-Britain engaged to vote for the elector of Bavaria at the ensuing election of an emperor. The design of the French court was to raise this prince to the Imperial dignity, and furnish him with such succours as should enable him to deprive the queen of Hungary of her hereditary dominions.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ IX.</HEAD>
<P>While the French minister at Vienna endeavoured to amuse the queen with the strongest assurances of his master's friendship, a body of five and thirty thousand men began their march for Germany, in order to join the elector of Ba∣varia: another French army was assembled upon the Rhine; and the count de Belleisle being provided with large sums of money, was sent to negotiate with the different electors. Having thus secured a majority of voices, he proceeded to Munich, where he presented the elector of Bavaria with a commission ap∣pointing him generalissimo of the French troops marching to his assistance; and now the treaty of Nymphenburg was concluded. The French king en∣gaged to assist the elector with his whole power, towards raising him to the Im∣perial throne: the elector promised, that after his elevation he would never attempt to recover any of the towns or provinces of the empire which France had conquered: that he would, in his Imperial capacity, renounce the barrier-treaty; and agree, that France should irrevocably retain whatever places she should subdue in the Austrian Netherlands. The next step of Belleisle was to negotiate another treaty between France and Prussia, importing, That the elector of Bavaria should possess Bohemia, Upper Austria, and the Tyrolese: That the king of Poland should be gratified with Moravia and Upper Silesia: and, That his Prussian majesty should retain Lower Silesia, with the town of Neiss and the county of Glatz. These precautions being taken, the count de Belleisle repaired to Franckfort, in quality of ambassador and plenipo∣tentiary from France, at the Imperial diet of election. It was in this city that the French king published a declaration, signifying, that as the king of Great-Britain had assembled an army to influence the approaching election of an em∣peror, his most christian majesty, as guarantee of the treaty of Westphalia, had ordered some troops to advance towards the Rhine, with a view to maintain the tranquillity of the Germanic body, and secure the freedom of the Imperial election.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="10" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ X.</HEAD>
<P>In July the elector of Bavaria being joined by the French forces under m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rechal Broglio, surprised the imperial city of Pafsau upon the Danube; and entering Upper Austria, at the head of seventy thousand men, took possession of Li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tz, where he received the homage of the states of that country. Under∣standing that the garrison of Vienna was very numerous, and that count Palsi had assembled thirty thousand Hungarians in the neighbourhood of this capital, he made no farther progress in Austria, but marched into Bohemia, where he was reinforced by a considerable body of Saxons, under the command of count Rutowski, natural son to the late king of Poland. By this time his Polish ma∣jesty had acceded to the treaty of Nymphenburg, and declared war against the queen of Hungary, on the most frivolous pretences. The elector of Bavaria
<PB N="613" REF="6160"/>
advanced to Prague, which was taken in the night by scalade: an atchievement in which Maurice count of Saxe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another natural son of the king of Poland, distinguished himself at the head of the French forces. In December the elector of Bavaria made his public entry into this capital, where he was proclaimed king of Bohemia, and inaugurated with the usual solemnities: then he set out for Franckfort, to be present at the diet of election.</P>

<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XI.</HEAD>
<P>At this period the queen of Hungary saw herself abandoned by all her allies, and seemingly devoted to destruction. She was not, however, for∣saken by her courage; nor destitute of good officers and an able ministry. She retired to Presburg, and in a pathetic Latin speech to the states, expressed her confidence in the loyalty and valour of her Hungarian subjects. The no∣bility of that kingdom, touched with her presence and distress, assured her una∣nimously, that they would sacrifice their lives and fortunes in her defence. The ban being raised, that brave people crowded to her standard; and the diet ex∣pressed their resentment against her enemy by a public edict, excluding for ever the electoral house of Bavaria from the succession to the crown of Hun∣gary: yet, without the subsidy she received from Great-Britain their courage and attachment would have proved ineffectual. By this supply she was enabled to pay her army, erect magazines, complete her warlike preparations, and put her strong places in a posture of defence. In December her generals Berenclau and Mentzel defeated count Thoring, who commanded eight thousand men, at the pass of Scardingen, and opening their way into Bavaria, layed the whole country under contribution; while count Khevenhuller retook the city of Lintz, and drove the French troops out of Austria. The grand signor assured the queen of Hungary, that far from taking advantage of her troubles, he should seize all opportunities to convince her of his friendship: the pope permit∣ted her to levy a tenth on the revenues of the clergy within her dominions<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and even to use all the church-plate for the support of the war.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XII.</HEAD>
<P>As the czarina expressed an inclination to assist this unfortunate prin∣cess, the French court resolved to find her employment in another quarter. They had already gained over to their interest count Gyllenburg, primi-minister and president of the chancery in Sweden. A dispute happening between him and Mr. Burnaby, the British resident at Stockholm, some warm altercation passed: Mr. Burnaby was forbid the court, and published a memorial in his own vindication, while the king of Sweden justified his conduct in a rescript sent to all the foreign ministers. The king of Great-Britain had proposed a subsidy-treaty to Sweden, which, from the influence of French counsels, was rejected. The Swedes hav∣ing assembled a numerous army in Finland, and equipped a large squadron of ships, declared war against Russia, upon the most trifling pretences; and the fleet putting to sea, commenced hostilities by blocking up the Russian ports in Livonia. A body of eleven thousand Swedes, commanded by general Wrangel, having advanced to Willmenstrand, were in August attacked and defeated by general Lasci, at the head of thirty thousand Russians. Count Lewenhaupt, who commanded the main army of the Swedes, resolved to take vengeance for this disgrace, after the Russian troops had retired into winter-quarters. In De∣cember he marched towards Wybourg; but, receiving letters from the prince of Hesse-Homburgh, and the marquis de la Chetardie, the French ambassador at Petersburgh, informing him of the surprising revolution which had just hap∣pened
<PB N="614" REF="6170"/>
in Russia, and proposing a suspension of hostilities, be retreated with his army, in order to wait for further instructions; and the two courts agreed to a cessation of arms for three months.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="13" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XIII.</HEAD>
<P>The Russians had been for some time discontented with their go∣vernment. The late czarina was influenced chiefly by German councils, and employed a great number of foreigners in her service. These causes of discon∣tent produced factions and conspiracies; and when they were discovered, the empress treated the authors of them with such severity as increased the ge∣neral disaffection. Besides, they were displeased at the manner in which she had settled the succession. The prince of Brunswic-Lunenburgh-Bevern, father to the young czar, was not at all agreeable to the Russian nobility, and his consort the princess Anne of Mecklenburgh, having assumed the reins of government during her son's minority, seemed to follow the maxims of her aunt, the late czarina. The Russian grandees and generals, therefore, turned their eyes upon the princess Elizabeth, who was daughter to Peter the Great, and the darling of the empire. The French ambassador gladly concurred in a project for deposing a princess who was well affected to the house of Austria. General Lasci ap∣proved of the design, which was chiefly conducted by the prince of Hesse-Hom∣burgh, who, in the reigns of the empress Catherine and Peter II. had been ge∣neralissimo of the Russian army. The good will and concurrence of the troops being secured, two regiments of guards took possession of all the avenues of the imperial palace at Petersburgh. The princess Elizabeth, putting herself at the head of one thousand men, on the fifth day of December entered the winter-palace, where the princess of Mecklenburg and the infant czar resided. She ad∣vanced into the chamber where the princess and her consort lay, and desired them to rise and quit the palace, adding, that their persons were safe; and, that they could not justly blame her for asserting her right. At the same time, the counts Osterman, Golofkin, Mingden, and Munich, were arrested; their papers and effects were seized, and their persons conveyed to Schlisselbourg, a fortress on the Neva. Early in the morning the senate assembling, declared all that had passed since the reign of Peter II. to be usurpation; and, that the imperial dignity belonged of right to the princess Elizabeth, who was publicly pro∣claimed empress of all the Russias, and immediately recognized by the army in Finland. She forthwith published a general act of indemnity: she created the prince of Hesse-Homburgh generalissimo of her armies: she restored the Dol∣gorucky family to their honours and estates: she recalled and rewarded all those who had been banished for favouring her pretensions: she mitigated the exile of the duke of Courland, by indulging him with a maintenance more suitable to his rank: she released general Wrangel, count Wasaburg, and the other Swedish officers, who had been taken at the battle of Wilmanstrand; and the princess Anne of Mecklenburgh, with her consort and children, were sent under a strong guard, to Riga the capital of Livonia.</P>

<P>Amidst these tempests of wars and revolution, the states-general wisely determined to preserve their own tranquillity. It was doubtless, their interest to avoid the dangers and expence of a war, and to profit by that stag∣nation of commerce which would necessarily happen among their neighbours that were at open enmity with each other: besides, they were over-awed by the declarations of the French monarch on one side; by the power, activity, and pre∣tensions
<PB N="615" REF="6180"/>
of his Prussian majesty on the other; and they dreaded the prospect of a stadtholder at the head of their army. These at least were the sentiments of many Dutch patriots, reinforced by others that acted under French influence. But, the prince of Orange numbered among his partisans and adherents many persons of dignity and credit in the commonwealth; and he was adored by the populace, who loudly exclaimed against their governors, and clamoured for a war, without ceasing. This national spirit, joined to the remonstrances and re∣quisitions made by the courts of Vienna and London, obliged the states to issue orders for an augmentation of their forces; but these were executed so slowly, that neither France nor Prussia had much cause to take umbrage at their pre∣parations. In Italy the king of Sardinia declared for the house of Austria: the republic of Genoa was deeply engaged in the French interest: the pope, the Vene∣tians, and the dukedom of Tuscany were neutral: the king of Naples resolved to support the claim of his family to the Austrian dominions in Italy, and began to make preparations accordingly. His mother the queen of Spain had formed a plan for erecting these dominions into a monarchy for her second son Don Philip; and a body of fifteen thousand men being embarked at Barcelona, were transported to Orbitello, under the convoy of the united squadrons of France and Spain. While admiral Haddock, with twelve ships of the line, lay at anchor in the bay of Gibraltar, the Spanish fleet passed the Streights in the night, and was joined by the French squadron from Toulon. The British admiral sailing from Gibraltar, fell in with them in a few days, and found both squadrons drawn up in line of battle. As he bore down upon the Spanish fleet, the French admiral sent a flag of truce to inform him, that as the French and Spaniards were engaged in a joint-expedition, he should be obliged to act in concert with his master's allies. This interposition prevented an engagement, the combined fleets amounting to double the number of the English squadron. Admiral Haddock was obliged to desist; and proceeded to Portmahon, leaving the enemy to prosecute their voyage without molestation. The people of England were incensed at this transaction, and did not scruple to affirm, that the hands of the British admiral were tied up by the neutrality of Hanover <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In the month of July two ships of Had∣dock's squadron sailing in with three French ships of war, captain Parnet the English com∣modore, supposing them to be Spanish register ships, fired a shot, in order to bring them to; and they refusing to comp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with this signal, a sharp engagement ensued; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they had fought seve∣ral hours, the French commander ceased firing, and thought proper to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome to an explanation, when he and Barnet parted with mutual apolo∣gies.</P>

<P>The court of Madrid seemed to have shaken off that indolence and phlegm which had formerly disgraced the councils of Spain. They no sooner learned the destination of commodore Anson, who had sailed from Spithead in the course of the preceding year, than they sent Don Pizzaro, with a more powerful squadron, upon the same voyage, to defeat his design. He accord∣ingly steered the same course, and actually fell in with one or two ships of the British armament, near the Streights of Magellan; but he could not weather
<PB N="616" REF="6190"/>
a long and furious tempest, through which Mr. Anson proceeded into the South-Sea. One of the Spanish ships perished at sea; another was wrecked on the coast of Brazil; and Pizarro bore away for the Rio de la Plata, where he arrived with the three remaining ships, in a shattered condition, after having lost twelve hundred men by sickness and famine. The Spaniards exerted the same vigilance and activity in Europe. Their privateers were so industrious and successful, that in the beginning of this year, they had taken, since the commencement of the war, four hundred and seven ships, belonging to the subjects of Great-Britain, and valued at near four millions of piastres. The traders had therefore too much cause to complain, considering the formi∣dable fleets which were maintained for the protection of commerce. In the course of the summer, Sir John Norris had twice sailed towards the coast of Spain, at the he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d of a powerful squadron, without taking any effectual step for annoying the enemy, as if the sole intention of the ministry had been to ex∣pose the nation to the ridicule and contempt of its enemies. The inactivity of the British arms appears the more inexcusable, when we consider the great armaments which had been prepared. The land-forces of Great-Britain, ex∣clusive of the Danish and Hessian auxiliaries, amounted to sixty thoudand men; and the fleet consisted of above one hundred ships of war, manned by fifty four thousand sailors.</P>

<P>The general discontent of the people had a manifest influence upon the election of members for the new parliament, which produced one of the most violent contests between the two parties, which had happened since the revolu∣tion. All the adherents of the prince of Wales concurred with the country party, in opposition to the minister; and the duke of Argyle exerted himself so successfully among the shires and burroughs of Scotland, that the partisans of the ministry could not secure six members out of the whole number returned from North-Britain. They were however much more fortunate in the election of the sixteen peers, who were chosen literally according to the list transmitted from court. Instructions were delivered by the constituents to a great num∣ber of members returned for cities and counties, exhorting and requiring them to oppose a standing army in time of peace; to vote for the mitigation of ex∣cise laws; for the repeal of septennial parliaments, for the limitation of place∣men in the house of commons; and they insisted upon their examining <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto the particulars of the public expence, and endeavouring to redress the grievances of the nation. Obstinate struggles were maintained in all parts of the united kingdom with uncommon ardour and perseverance; and such a national spirit of opposition prevailed, that notwithstanding the whole weight of ministerial influence, the contrary interest seemed to preponderate in the new parliament.</P>

<HEAD>§ XVII.</HEAD>
<P>The king returned to England in the month of October; and on the first day of December, the session was opened. Mr. Onslow being re-chosen speaker, was approved of by his majesty, who spoke in the usual stile to both houses. He observed, that the former parliament had formed the strongest re∣solutions in favour of the queen of Hungary, for the maintenance of the prag∣matic sanction: for the preservation of the balance of power, and the peace and liberties of Europe; and that, if the other powers which were under the like engagements with him, had answered the just expectations so solemnly given, the support of the common cause would have been attended with less difficulty.
<PB N="617" REF="6200"/>
He said, he had endeavoured, by the most proper and early applications, to induce other powers that were united with him by the ties of common interest, to concert such measures as so important and critical a conjuncture required: that where an accommodation seemed necessary, he had laboured to reconcile princes whose union would have been the most effectual means to prevent the mischiefs which had happened, and the best security for the interest and safety of the whole. He owned his endeavours had not hitherto produced the de∣sired effect; though he was not without hope, that a just sense of approaching danger would give a more favourable turn to the councils of other nations. He represented the necessity of putting the nation in such a posture of defence as would enable him to improve all opportunities of maintaining the liberties of Europe, and defeat any attempts that should be made against him and his dominions; and he recommended unanimity, vigour, and dispatch. The house of commons having appointed their several committees, the speaker reported the king's speech; and Mr. Herbert moved for an address of thanks, including an approbation of the means by which the war had been prosecuted. The mo∣tion being seconded by Mr. Trevor, lord Noel Somerset stood up and moved, that the house would in their address desire his majesty, not to engage these kingdoms in a war for the preservation of his foreign dominions. He was supported by that incorruptible patriot Mr. Shippen, who declared, he was nei∣ther ashamed nor afraid to affirm, that thirty years had made no change in any of his political opinions. He said, he was grown old in the house of commons; that time had verified the predictions he had formerly uttered; and that he had seen his conjectures ripened into knowledge. <Q>“If my country, added he, has been so unfortunate as once more to commit her interest to men who pro∣pose to themselves no advantage from their trust but that of selling it, I may, perhaps, fall once more under censure for declaring my opinion, and be once more treated as a criminal, for asserting what they who punish me cannot deny; for maintaining, that Hanoverian maxims are inconsistent with the happiness of this nation; and for preserving the caution so strongly inculcated by those patriots who framed the act of settlement, and conferred upon the present royal family their title to the throne.”</Q> He particularised the instances in which the ministry had acted in diametrical opposition to that necessary consti∣tution; and he insisted on the necessity of taking some step to remove the ap∣prehensions of the people, who began to think themselves in danger of being sacrificed to the security of foreign dominions. Mr. Gibbon, who spoke on the same side of the question, expatiated upon the absurdity of returning thanks for the prosecution of a war which had been egregiously mismanaged. <Q>“What! said he, are our thanks to be solemnly returned for defeats, disgrace, and losses, the ruin of our merchants, the imprisonment of our sailors, idle shows of armaments, and useless expences?”</Q> Sir Robert Walpole having made a short speech in de∣fence of the first motion for an address, was answered by Mr. Pulteney, who seemed to be animated with a double proportion of patriot indignation. He asserted, that from a review of that minister's conduct since the beginning of the dispute with Spain, it would appear, that he had been guilty not only of single errors, but of deliberate treachery: that he had always co-operated with the enemies of his country, and sacrificed to his private interest the happiness and honour of the British nation. He then entered into a detail of that conduct against which

There was a great number of disputed elections; and the discussion of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on which the people had turned their eyes, as the criterion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> In the first, which was heard at the bar of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by a majority of six only; and this he looked <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> than a victory. His enemies exulted in their strength: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in matters of impoetance, by several mem∣bers who <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against them on this occasion. The inconsiderable majority that appeared on the side of the administration, plainly proved, that the influ∣ence of the minister was greatly diminished, and seemed to prognosticate his fur∣ther decline. This consideration induced some individuals to declare against him as a setting sun, from whose beams they could expect no warmth. His adherents began to tremble; and he himself had occasion for all his art and equanimity. The court-interest was not sufficient to support the election of their own members for Westminster. The high-bailiff had been guilty of some illegal practices at the poll; and three justices of the peace had, on pretence of preventing riots, sent for a military force to overawe the election. A petition presented by the electors of Westminster was taken into consideration by the house; and the election was declared void by a majority of four voices. The high-bailiff was taken into custody; the officer who had ordered the soldiers to march, and the three justices who signed the letter, in consequence of which he a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed, were re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rimanded on their knees at the bar of the house.</P>

His emissaries did not fail to tamper <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> these members of the opposite party, who were the most likely to be con∣verted by their arguments. A message was sent by the bishop of Oxford to the prince of Wales, importing, That if his royal highness would write a letter of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to the king, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eand all his counseilors should be taken into favour; fifty thousand pounds should be added to his revenue; four times that sum be disbursed immediately for the payment of his debts; and suitable provision be made in due time for all his followers. The prince declined this proposal, de∣claring, that he would accept no such conditions while Sir Robert Walpole con∣tinued to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the public affairs: that he looked upon him as a bar between his majesty and the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his people; as the author of the national grievances bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> at home and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and the sole cause of that contempt which Great-Britain had incurred in all the courts of Europe. His royal highness was now chief of
<PB N="619" REF="6220"/>
this formidable party, revered by the whole nation; a party which had gained the ascendancy in the house of commons; which professed to act upon the princi∣ples of public virtue; which demanded the fall of an odious minister, as a sa∣crifice due to an injured people; and declared, that no temptation could shake their virtue; that no art could dissolve the cement by which they were united. Sir Robert Walpole, though repulsed in his attempt upon the prince of Wales, was more successful in his other endeavours. He resolved to try his strength once more in the house of commons, in another disputed election; and had the mortification to see the majority in the opposition augmented to sixteen voices. He declared, he would never more sit in that house; and next day, which was the third of February, the king adjourned both houses of parliament to the eighteenth day of the same month. In this interim Sir Robert Walpole was created earl of Orford, and resigned all his employments.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="20" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XX.</HEAD>
<P>At no time of his life did he acquit himself with such prudential policy as he now displayed. He found means to separate the parts that com∣posed the opposition, and to transfer the popular od<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m from himself to these who had professed themselves his keenest adversaries. The country party con∣sisted of the Tories, reinforced by discontented Whigs, who had either been disappointed in their own ambitious vie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, or felt for the distresses of their country, occasioned by a weak and worthless administration. The old patriots and the Whigs whom they had joined, acted upon very different, and indeed, upon opposite principles of government; and therefore, they were united only by the ties of convenience. A coalition was proposed between the discontented Whigs and those of the same denomination who acted in the ministry. Some were gratified with titles and offices; and all were assured, that in the manage∣ment of affairs, a new system would be adopted, according to the plan they themselves should propose. The court required nothing of them, but that the earl of Orford should escape with impunity. His place of chancellor of the exchequer was bestowed upon Mr. Sandys, who was likewise appointed a lord of the treasury; and the earl of Wilmington succeeded him as first commissioner of that board. Lord Harrington being dignified with the title of earl, was declared president of the council; and in his room lord Carteret became secre∣tary of state. The duke of Argyle was made master-general of the ordnance, colonel of his majesty's royal regiment of horse-guards, and field-marshal and com∣mander in chief of all the forces in South-Britain; but, finding himself disap∣pointed in his expectations of the coalition, he, in less than a month, renounced all these employments. The marquis of Tweedale was appointed secretary of state for Scotland, a post which had been long suppressed: Mr. Pulteney was sworn of the privy-council, and afterwards created earl of Bath. The earl of Winchelsea and Nottingham was preferred to the head of the admiralty, in the room of Sir Charles Wager; and, after the resignation of the duke of Argyle, the earl of Stair was appointed field-marshal of all his majesty's forces, and am∣bassador-extraordinary to the states-general. On the seventeenth day of Fe∣bruary the prince of Wales, attended by a numerous retinue of his adherents, waited on his majesty, who received him graciously, and ordered his guards to be restored. The lord Carteret and Mr. Sandys were the first who embraced the offers of the court, without the consent or privity of any other leaders in the opposition, except that of Mr. Pulteney; but, they declared to their friends,
<PB N="620" REF="6230"/>
they would still proceed upon patriot principles: that they would concur in promoting an inquiry into past measures; and, in enacting necessary laws to secure the constitution from the practices of corruption. These professions were believed, not only by their old condjutors in the house of commons, but also by the nation in general. The reconciliation between the king and the prince of Wales, together with the change in the ministry, were celebrated with public rejoi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings all over the kingdom: and immediately after the adjournment, no∣thing but concord appeared in the house of commons.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="21" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXI.</HEAD>
<P>But this harmony was of short duration. It soon appeared, that those who had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the loudest for the liberties of their country, had been <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> by the most sordid, and even the most ridiculous motives of self-interest. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and mutual distrust ensued between them and their former confederates. The nation complained, that instead of a total change of men and measures, they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the old ministry strengthened by this coalition; and the sameinterest in parliament predominating with redoubled influence. They branded the new converts as apostates and betrayers of their country; and, in the tran∣sports of their indignation, they entirely overlooked the old object of their re∣sentment. That a nobleman of pliant principles, narrow fortune, and un∣bounded ambition, should forsake his party for the blandishments of affluence, power, and authority, will not appear strange to any person acquainted with the human heart; but, the sensible part of mankind will always reflect with amaze∣ment upon the conduct of a man, who seeing himself idolized by his fellow∣citizens, as the first and firmest patriot of the kingdom, as one of the most shining ornaments of his country, could give up all his popularity, and incur the contempt or detestation of mankind, for the wretched consideration of an empty title, without office, influence, or the least substantial appendage. One cannot without an emotion of grief, contemplate such an instance of infatua∣tion. One cannot but lament, that such glory should have been so weakly for∣feited: that such talents should have been lost to the cause of liberty and virtue. Doubtless, he flattered himself with the hope of one day directing the councils of his sovereign; but, this was never accomplished, and he remained a solitary monument of blasted ambition. Before the change in the ministry, Mr. Pul∣teney moved, that the several papers relating to the conduct of the war which had been layed before the house, should be referred to a select committee, who should examine strictly into the particulars, and make a report to the house of their remarks and objections. The motion introduced a debate; but, upon a division was rejected by a majority of three voices. Petitions having been presented by the merchants of London, Bristol, Liverpool, Glasgow, and almost all the trading towns in the kingdom, complaining of the losses they had sustained by the bad conduct of the war, the house resolved itself into a committee, to deliberate on these remonstrances. The articles of the London petition were explained by Mr. Glover, an eminent merchant of that city. Six days were spent in perusing papers and examining witnesses; then the same gen∣tleman summed up the evidence, and in a pathetic speech endeavoured to de∣monstrate, that the commerce of Great-Britain had been exposed to the insults and rapine of the Spaniards, not by inattention or accident, but by one uniform and continued design. This inquiry being resumed after the adjournment, copies of instructions to admirals and captains of cruising ships were layed be∣fore
<PB N="621" REF="6240"/>
the house; and the commons passed several resolutions, upon which a bill was prepared for the better protecting and securing the trade and navigation of the kingdom. It made its way through the lower house; but was thrown out by the lords. The pension-bill was revived and sent up to the peers, where it was again rejected, lord Carteret voting against that very measure which he had so lately endeavoured to promote. On the ninth day of March the lord Limerick made a motion for appointing a committee, to inquire into the con∣duct of affairs for the last twenty years: he was seconded by Sir John St. Aubyn, and supported by Mr. Velters Cornwal, Mr. Philips, Mr. W. Pitt, and lord Percival the new member for Westminster, who had already signalized himself by his eloquence and capacity. The motion was opposed by Sir Charles Wager, Mr. Pelham, and Mr. Henry Fox, surveyor-general to his majesty's works, and brother to lord Ilchester. Though the opposition was faint and frivolous, the proposal was rejected by a majority of two voices. Lord Limerick, not yet discouraged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1742.</NOTE> made a motion on the twenty-third day of March, for an inquiry into the con∣duct of Robert earl of Orford, for the last ten years of his administration; and after a sharp debate, it was carried in the affirmative. The house resolved to choose a secret committee by ballot; and in the mean time presented an address to the king, assuring him of their fidelity, zeal, and affection.</P>

<P>Sir Robert Godschall having moved for leave to bring in a bill, to repeal the act for septennial parliaments, he was seconded by Sir John Barnard; but warmly opposed by Mr. Pulteney and Mr. Sandys; and the question passed in the negative. The committee of secrecy being chosen, began to examine evidence, and Mr. Paxton sollicitor to the treasury, refusing to answer such questions as were put to him, lord Limerick, chairman of the committee, com∣plained to the house of his obstinacy. He was first taken into custody; and still persisting in his refusal, committed to Newgate. Then his lordship moved, that leave should be given to bring in a bill for indemnifying evidence against the earl of Orford; and it was actually prepared by a decision of the majority. In the house of lords it was vigorously opposed by lord Carteret, and as strenu∣ously supported by the duke of Argyle; but fell upon a division, by the weight of superior numbers. Those members in the house of commons who heartily wished that the inquiry might be prosecuted, were extremely incensed at the fate of this bill. A committee was appointed to search the journals of the lords for precedents; and their report being read, lord Strange, son of the earl of Derby, moved for a resolution, That the lords refusing to concur with the com∣mons of Great-Britain, in an indemnification necessary to the effectual carrying on the inquiry now depending in parliament, is an obstruction to justice, and may prove fatal to the liberties of this nation. The motion, which was seconded by lord Quarendon, son of the earl of Litchfield, gave rise to a warm de∣bate; and Mr. Sandys declaimed against it as a step that would bring on an immediate dissolution of the present form of government. It is really amazing to see with what effrontery some men can shift their maxims, and openly con∣tradict the whole tenor of their former conduct. Mr. Sandys did not pass un∣censured; he sustained some severe sarcasms on his apostacy, from Sir John Hynde Cotton, who refuted all his objections: nevertheless, the motion passed in the negative. Notwithstanding this great obstruction; purposely thrown in
<PB N="622" REF="6250"/>
the way of the inquiry, the secret committee discovered many flagrant instances of fraud and corruption in which the earl of Orford had been concerned. It appeared, that he had granted fraudelent contracts for paying the troops in the West-Indies: that he had employed iniquitous arts to influence elections: that for secret-service during the last ten years, he had touched one million four hundred fifty-three thousand four hundred pounds of the public money: that above fifty thousand pounds of this sum had been payed to authors and printers of news-papers and political tracts, written in defence of the ministry: that on the very day which preceded his resignation, he had signed orders on the civil∣list revenues for above thirty thousand pounds: that as the cash remaining in the exchequer, did not much exc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d fourteen thousand pounds, he had raised the remaining part of the thirty thousand, by pawning the orders to a banker. The committee proceeded to make further progress in their scrutiny, and had almost prepared a third report, when they were interrupted by the prorogation of parliament</P>

<P>The ministry finding it was necessary to take some step for con∣ciliating the affection of the people, gave way to a bill for excluding certain officers from seats in the house of commons. They passed another for en∣couraging the linen manufacture; another for regulating the trade of the plan∣tations; and a third to prevent the marriage of lunatics. They voted forty thousand seamen, and sixty-two thousand five hundred landmen for the service of the current year. They provided for the subsidies to Denmark and Hesse Cassel, and voted five hundred thousand pounds to the queen of Hungary. The expence of the year amounted to near six millions, raised by the land-tax at four shillings in the pound, the malt tax, one million from the sinking fund, annuities granted upon it for eight hundred thousand pounds, and a loan of one million six hundred thousand pounds from the bank. In the month of July, John lord Gower was appointed keeper of his majesty's privy-seal; Allen lord Bathurst was made captain of the bank of pensioners; on the fif∣teenth day of the month, Mr. Pulteney took his flat in the house of peers, as earl of Bath. The king closed the session in the usual way, after having given them to understand, that a treaty of peace was concluded between the queen of Hungary and the king of Prussia, under his mediation; and that the late successes of the Austrian arms were in a great measure owing to the generous assistance afforded by the British nation.</P>

<P>By this time great changes had happened in the affairs of the con∣tinent.

Thither the imperial diet was removed from Ratisbon: they confirmed his election, and indulged him with a subsidy of fifty Roman months, amounting to about two hundred thousand pounds sterling. In the mean time, the Austrian general Khevenhuller ravaged his electorate, and made himself master of Munich, the capital of Bavaria: he likewise laid part of the Palatinate under contribution, in resentment for that elector's having sent a body of his troops to reinforce the Imperial army. In March, count Saxe, with a detachment of French and Bavarians, reduced Egra; and the Austrians were obliged to evacuate Bavaria, though they afterwards returned.

to Dinglesing on the Iser, to observe the motions of the enemy, who were now become extremely formidable. In May, a detachment of French and Ba∣rians advanced to the castle of Hilkersbergh on the Danube, with a view to take possession of a bridge over the river: the Austrian garrison immediately marched out to give them battle, and a severe action ensued, in which the Im∣perialists were defcated.</P>

<P>In the beginning of the year, the queen of Hungary had assembled two considerable armies in Moravia and Bohemia. Prince Charles of Lorrain, at the head of fifty thousand men, advanced against the Saxons and Prussians, who thought proper to retire with precipitation from Moravia, which they had invaded. Then the prince took the route to Bohemia; and marshal Broglio, who commanded the French forces in that country, must have fallen a sacri∣fice, had not the king of Prussia received a strong reinforcement, and entered that kingdom before his allies could be attacked. The two armies advanced towards each other; and, on the seventeenth of May, joined battle at Czas∣law, where the Austrians at first gained a manifest advantage, and penetrated as far as the Prussian baggage; then the irregulars began to plunder so eagerly, that they neglected every other consideration. The Prussian insantry took this oppor∣tunity to rally; the battle was renewed, and, after a very obstinate contest, the victory was snatched out of the hands of the Austrians, who were obliged to retire with the loss of five thousand men killed, and twelve hundred taken by the enemy. The Prussians paid dear for the honour of remaining on the field of battle; and from the circumstances of this action, the king is said to have con∣ceived a disgust to the war. When the Austrians made such progress in the beginning of the engagement, he rode off with great expedition, until he was recalled by a message from his general the count de Schwerin, assuring his ma∣jesty that there was no danger of a defeat. Immediately after this battle, he discovered an inclination to accommodate all differences with the queen of Hungary. The earl of Hyndford, ambassador from the court of Great-Bri∣tain, who accompanied him in this campaign, and was vested with full powers by her Hungarian majesty, did not fail to cultivate this favourable disposition; and on the first day of June, a treaty of peace between the two powers was concluded at Breslau. The queen ceded to his Prussian majesty, the Upper and Lower Silesia, with the county of Glatz in Bohemia; and he charged himself with the payment of the sum lent by the merchants of London to the late em∣peror, on the Sile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n revenues. He likewise engaged to observe a strict neu∣trality during the war, and to withdraw his forces from Bohemia in fifteen days after the r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ification of the treaty, in which were comprehended the king of Great-Britain elector of Hanover, the Czarina, the king of Denmark, the states general, the house of Wolsenbuttle, and the king of Poland elector of Saxony, on certain conditions, which were accepted.</P>

<P>The king of Prussia, recalled his troops; while marshal Broglio, who commanded the French auxiliaries in that kingdom, and the count de Bel∣leisle, abandoned their magazines and baggage, and retired with precipitation un∣der the cannon of Prague. There they intrenched themselves in an advanta∣geous situation; and prince Charles being joined by the other body of Austri∣ans under prince Lobkowitz, encamped in sight of them, on the hills of Giris∣nitz. The grand duke of Tuscany arrived in the Austrian army, of which he
<PB N="624" REF="6270"/>
took the command; and the French generals offered to surrender Prague, Egra, and all the other places they possessed in Bohemia, provided they might be al∣lowed to march off with their arms, artillery, and baggage. The proposal was rejected, and Prague invested on all sides about the end of July. Though the operations of the siege were carried on in an aukward and slovenly manner, the place was so effectually blocked up, that famine must have compelled the French to surrender at discretion, had not very extraordinary efforts been made for their relief. The emperor had made advances to the queen of Hungary. He promised that the French forces should quit Bohemia, and evacuate the em∣pire; and he offered to renounce all pretensions to the kingdom of Bohemia, on condition that the Austrians would restore Bavaria: but these conditions were declined by the court of Vienna. The king of France was no sooner ap∣prised of the condition to which the generals Broglio and Belleisle were re∣duced, than he sent orders to marshal Maillebois, who commanded his army on the Rhine, to march to their relief. His troops were immediately put in motion; and when they reached Amberg in the Upper Palatinate, joined by the French and Imperialists from Bavaria. Prince Charles of Lorrain having received intelligence of their junction and design, left eighteen thousand men to maintain the blockade of Prague, under the command of general Festititz, while he himself, with the rest of his army, advanced to Haydon on the frontiers of Bohemia, where he was joined by count Khevenhuller, who had followed the enemy from Bavaria, now commanded by count Seckendorff, and the count de Saxe. Seckendorff, however, was sent back to Bavaria, while marshal Maillebois entered Bohemia on the twenty-fifth day of September. But, he marched with such precaution, that prince Charles could not bring him to an engagement. Mean while Festititz, for want of a sufficient force, was obliged to abandon the blockade of Prague; and the French generals being now at li∣berty, took post at Leutmaritz. Maillebois advanced as far as Kadan; but, seeing the Austrians possessed of all the passes of the mountains, he marched back to the Palatinate, and was miserably harrassed in his retreat by prince Charles, who had left a strong body with prince Lobkowitz, to watch the mo∣tions of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lleisle and Broglio.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVII.</HEAD>
<P>These generals seeing themselves surrounded on all hands, re∣turned to Prague, from whence Broglio made his escape in the habit of a cou∣rier, and was sent to command the army of Maillebois, who was by this time disgraced. Prince Lobkowitz, who now directed the blockade of Prague, had so effectually cut off all communication between that place and the adjacent country, that in a little time the French troops were reduced to great extremity, both from the severity of the season, and the want of provision. They were already reduced to the necessity of eating horse-flesh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and unclean animals<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and they had no other prospect but that of perishing by famine or war; when their commander formed the scheme of a retreat, which was actually put in execu∣tion. Having taken some artful precautions to deceive the enemy, he, in the middle of December, departed from Prague at midnight, with about fourteen thousand men, thirty pieces of artillery, and some of the principal citizens as hostages for the safety of nine hundred soldiers whom he had left in garrison. Notwithstanding the difficulties he must have encountered at that season of the year, in a broken and unfrequented road, which he purposely chose, he
<PB N="625" REF="6280"/>
marched with such expedition, that he had gained the passes of the mountains, before he was overtaken by the horse and hussars of prince Lobkowitz. The fatigue and hardships which the miserable soldiers underwent, are inexpressible. A great number perished in the snow, and many hundreds fainting with weariness, cold, and hunger, were left to the mercy of the Austrian irregulars, consisting of the most barbarous people on the face of the earth. The count de Belleisle, though tortured with the hip-gout, behaved with surprising reso∣lution and activity. He caused himself to be carried in a litter to every place where he thought his presence was necessary, and made such dispositions, that the pursuers never could make an impression upon the body of his troops: but all his artillery, baggage, and even his own equipage, fell into the hands of the enemy. On the twenty-ninth day of December, he arrived at Egra, from whence he proceeded to Alsace without further molestation: but, when he returned to Versailles, he met with a very cold reception, notwithstanding the gallant exploit which he had performed. After his escape, prince Lobkowitz returned to Prague, and the small garrison which Belleisle had left surren∣dered upon honourable terms; so that this capital reverted to the house of Austria.</P>

<P>The king of Great-Britain resolving to make a powerful diver∣sion in the Netherlands, had, in the month of April, ordered sixteen thousand effective men to be embarked for that country: but, as this step was taken without any previous concert with the states-general, the earl of Stair destined to the command of the forces in Flanders, was in the mean time appointed ambassador-extraordinary and plenipotentiary to their high-mightinesses, in or∣der to persuade them to co-operate vigorously in the plan which his Britannic majesty had formed. A plan by which Great Britain was engaged as a princi∣pal in a foreign dispute, and intailed upon herself the whole burden of an expensive war, big with ruin and disgrace. England, from being the umpire, was now become a party in all continental quarrels; and instead of trimming the balance of Europe, lavished away her blood and treasure, in supporting the interest and allies of a puny electorate in the north of Germany. The king of Prussia had been at variance with the elector of Hanover. The dutchy of Mec∣klenburg was the avowed subject of dispute; but his Prussian majesty is said to have had other more provoking causes of complaint, which, however, he did not think proper to divulge. The king of Great-Britain found it convenient to accommodate these differences. In the course of this summer, the two powers concluded a convention, in consequence of which, the troops of Ha∣nover evacuated Mecklenburg; and three regiments of Brandenburg took possession of those bailiwicks that were mortgaged to the king of Prussia. The electorate of Hanover being now secured from danger, sixteen thousand troops of that country, together with the six thousand auxiliary<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Hessians, began their march for the Netherlands; and about the middle of October arrived in the neighbourhood of Brussels, where they encamped. The earl of Stair repaired to Ghent, where the British forces were quartered: a body of Austrians was as∣sembled; and though the season was far advanced, he seemed determined upon some expedition: but all of a sudden, the troops were sent into winter-quarters. The Austrians retired to Luxemburg; the English and Hessians remained in
<PB N="626" REF="6290"/>
Flanders; and the Hanoverians marched into the county of Liege, without paying any regard to the bishop's protestation.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="29" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The states-general had made a considerable augmentation of their forces by sea and land; but, notwithstand ng the repeated instances of the earl of Stair, they resolved to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dhere to their neutrality: they dreaded the neigh∣bourhood of the French; and they were far from being pleased to see the English get footing in the Netherlands. The friends of the house of Orange begin to exert themselves: the states of Groningen and West-Friesland, pro∣tested, in favour of the prince, against the promotion of foreign generals, which had lately been made: but his interest was powerfully opposed by the provinces of Zealand and Holland, which had the greatest weight in the republic. The revolution in Russia did not put an end to the war with Sweden. These two powers had agreed to an armistice of three months, during which the czarina augmented her forces in Finland. She likewise ordered the counts Osterman and Munich, with their adherents, to be tried: they were condemned to death, but pardoned on the scaffold, and sent in exile to Siberia. The Swedes still encouraged by the intrigues of France, refused to listen to any terms of accom∣modation, unless Carelia, and the other conquests of the czar Peter should be re∣stored. The French court had expected to bring over the new empress to their measures; but they found her as well disposed as her predecessor, to assist the house of Austria. She remitted a considerable sum of money to the queen of Hungary; and at the same time congratulated the elector of Bavaria on his ele∣vation to the imperial throne. The ceremony of her coronation was performed in May, with great solemnity at Moscow; and in November, she declared her nephew the duke of Holstein-Gottorp her successor, by the title of grand prince of all the Russias. The cessation of arms being expired, general Lascy reduced Fredericksheim, and obliged the Swedish army, commanded by count Lewenhaupt, to retire before him, from one place to another, until at length they were quite surrounded near Helsingfors. In this emergency, the Swedish general submitted to a capitulation, by which his infantry were transported by sea to Sweden; his cavalry marched by land to Abo, and his artillery and ma∣gazines remained in the hands of the Russians. The king of Sweden being of an advanced age, the diet assembled in order to settle the successon; and the duke of Holstein-Gottorp, as grandson to the eldest sister of Charles XII. was declared next heir to the crown. A courier was immediately dispatched to Mos∣cow, to notify to the duke this determination of the diet; and this message was followed by a deputation: but, when they understood that he had embraced the religion of the Greek church, and been acknowledged successor to the throne of Russia, they annulled his election for Sweden, and resolved that the succession should not be re-established, until a peace should be concluded with the czarina. Conferences were opened at Abo for this purpose. In the mean time, the events of war had been so long unfortunate for Sweden, that it was absolutely necessary to appease the indignation of the people with some sa∣crifice. The generals Lewenhaupt and Bodenbrock were tried by a court-martial for misconduct: and being found guilty and condemned to death, they appealed to the diet, by which the sentence was confirmed. The term of the subsidy∣treaty between Great-Britain and Denmark expiring, his Danish majesty re∣fused
<PB N="627" REF="6300"/>
to renew it; nor would he accede to the peace of Breslau. On the other hand, he became subsidiary to France, with which also he concluded a new treaty of commerce.</P>

<P>The court of Versailles were now heartily tired of maintaining the war in Germany, and had actually made equitable proposals of peace to the queen of Hungary, by whom they were rejected. Thus repulsed, they redoubled their preparations; and endeavoured, by advantageous offers, to detach the king of Sardinia from the interest of the house of Austria. This prince had espoused a sister of the grand duke, who pressed him to declare for her brother, and the queen of Hungary promised to gratify him with some territories in the Mila∣nese; besides, he thought the Spaniards had already gained too much ground in Italy: but, at the same time, he was afraid of being crushed between France and Spain, before he could be properly supported. He therefore tem∣porised, and protracted the negotiation, until he was alarmed at the progress of the Spanish arms in Italy, and fixed in his determination by the subsidies of Great-Britain. The Spanish army assembled at Rimini, under the duke de Montemar; and being joined by the Neapolitan forces, amounted to sixty thou∣sand men, furnished with a large train of artillery. About the beginning of May, they entered the Bolognese: then the king of Sardinia declaring against them, joined the Austrian army commanded by count Traun, marched into the dutchy of Parma; and understanding that the duke of Modena had engaged in a treaty with the Spaniards, he dispossessed that prince of his dominions. The duke de Montemar seeing his army diminished by sickness and desertion, retreated to the kingdom of Naples, and was followed by the king of Sardinia, as far as Rimini.</P>

<P>Here he received intelligence, that Don Philip, third son of his catholic majesty, had made an irruption into Savoy with another army of Spa∣niards, and already taken possession of Chamberri the capital. He forthwith began his march for Piedmont. Don Philip abandoned Savoy at his approach, and retreating into Dauphiné, took post under the cannon of fort Barreaux. The king pursued him thither, and both armies remained in sight of each other till the month of December, when the marquis de Minas, an active and enter∣prising general, arrived from Madrid, and took upon him the command of the forces under Do# Philip. His first exploit was against the castle of Aspre∣mont, in the neighbourhood of the Sardinian camp. He attacked it so vigo∣rously that the garrison was obliged to capitulate in four and forty hours. The loss of this important post compelled the king to retire into Piedmont, and the Spaniards marched back into Savoy, where they established their winter-quarters. In the mean time the duke de Montemar, who directed the other Spanish army, though the duke of Modena was nominal generalissimo, resigned his command to count Gages, who attempted to penetrate into Tuscany; but was pre∣vented by the vigilance of count Traun the Austrian general. In December he quartered his troops in the Bolognese and Romagna; while the Austrians and Piedmontese, were distributed in the Modenese and Parmesan. The pope was passive during the whole campaign; the Venetians maintained their neutrality; and the king of the two Sicilies was overawed by the British fleet in the Medi∣terranean.</P>

Immediately after he had taken possession of his command, he ordered captain Norris to destroy five Spanish gallies which had put into the bay of St. Tropez; and this service was effectually performed. In May he detached commodore Rowley with eight sail, to cruise off the harbour of Toulon; and a great number of merchant<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ships belonging to the enemy fell into his hands. In August he sent commodore Martin with another squadron into the bay of Naples, to bombard that city, unless his Sicilian majesty would imme∣diately recal his troops which had joined the Spanish army, and promise to re∣main neuter during the continuance of the war. Naples was immediately filled with consternation: the king subscribed to these conditions; and the English squadron rejoined the admiral in the road of Hieres, which he had chosen for his winter-station. But before this period he had landed some men at St. Remo, in the territories of Genoa, and destroyed the magazines that were erected for the use of the Spanish army. He had likewise ordered two of his cruisers to attack a Spanish ship of the line which lay at anchor in the port of Ajaccio, in the island of Corsica; but, the Spanish captain set his men on shore, and blew up his ship, rather than she should fall into the hands of the English.</P>

<P>In the course of this year admiral Vernon and general Went∣worth made another effort in the West-Indies. They had received in January a reinforcement from England, and planned a new expedition, in concert with the governor of Jamaica, who accompanied them in the voyage. Their design was to disembark the troops at Porto-Bello, and march across the isthmus of Darien, to attack the rich town of Panama. They sailed from Jamaica on the ninth day of March, and on the twenty-eighth arrived at Porto-Bello. There they held a council of war, in which it was resolved, that as the troops were sickly, the rainy season begun, and several transports not yet ar∣rived, the intended expedition was become impracticable. In pursuance of this determination the armament immediately returned to Jamaica, exhibiting a ridiculous spectacle of folly and irresolution <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>In May two English frigates, commanded by captain Smith and captain Stuart, fell in with three Spanish ships of War, near the island of St. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> They forthwith engaged, and the action continued till night, by the favour of which the enemy retired to Porto-Rico in a shattered condition.</P>
<P>In the mouth of September the Tilbury ship of war of sixty guns was accidentally set on fire, and destroyed, off the island of Hispaniola: on which occasion one hundred and twenty-seven men pe∣rished; the rest were saved by captain Hoare of the Defiance, who happened to be on the same cru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e.</P></NOTE>. In August a ship of war was sent from thence, with about three hundred soldiers, to the small island Rattan, in the bay of Honduras, of which they took possession. In September Vernón and Wentworth received orders to return to England with such troops as re∣mained alive; and these did not amount to a tenth part of the number which had been sent abroad in that inglorious service. The inferior officers fell ignobly by sickness and despair, without an opportunity of signalizing their cou∣rage,
<PB N="629" REF="6320"/>
and the commanders lived to feel the scorn and reproach of their country. In the month of June the new colony of Georgia was invaded by an armament from St. Augustine, commanded by Don Marinel de Monteano, governor of that fortress. It consisted of six and thirty ships, from which four thousand men were landed at St. Simon's; and began their march for Frederica. Ge∣neral Oglethorpe, with a handful of men, took such wise precautions for oppos∣ing their progress, and harrassed them in their march with such activity and resolution, that after two of their detachments had been defeated, they retired to their ships, and totally abandoned the enterprize.</P>

<P>In England the merchants still complained, that their commerce was not properly protected, and the people clamoured against the conduct of the war. They said, their burthens were increased to maintain quarrels with which they had no concern; to defray the enormous expence of inactive fleets and pacific armies. The lord C. had now insinuated himself into the confidence of his sovereign, and engrossed the whole direction of public affairs. The war with Spain was now become a secondary consideration, and neglected accordingly; while the chief attention of the new minister was turned upon the affairs of the continent. The dispute with Spain concerned Britain only. The interests of Hanover were connected with the troubles of the empire. By pursuing this object he soothed the wishes of his master, and opened a more ample field for his own ambition. He had studied the policy of the continent with peculiar eagerness. This was the favourite subject of his reflection, upon which he thought and spoke with a degree of enthusiasm. The intolerable taxes, the po∣verty, the ruined commerce of his country, the iniquity of standing armies, votes of credit, and foreign connexions, upon which he had so often expatiated, were now forgotten, or overlooked. He saw nothing but glory, conquest, and acquired dominion. He set the power of France at defiance; and, as if Great-Britain had felt no distress, but teemed with treasure which she could not otherwise employ, he poured forth her millions with a rash and desperate hand, in purchasing beggarly allies and maintaining mercenary armies. The earl of Stair had arrived in England towards the end of August, and conferred with his majesty. A privy-council was summoned; and in a few days that nobleman returned to Holland. The lord Carteret was sent with a commission to the Hague in September; and when he returned, the baggage of the king and the duke of Cumberland, which had been shipped for Flanders, was ordered to be brought on shore. The parliament met on the sixteenth day of November, when his majesty told them, that he had augmented the British forces in the Low-Countries with sixteen thousand Hanoverians and the Hessian auxiliaries, in order to form such a force, in conjunction with the Austrian troops, as might be of service to the common cause in all events. He extolled the magnanimity and fortitude of the queen of Hungary, as well as the resolute conduct of the king of Sardinia, and his strict adherence to his engagements, though attacked in his own domi∣nions. He mentioned the requisition made by Sweden, of his good offices for procuring a peace between that nation and Russia; the defensive alliances which he had concluded with the czarina, and with the king of Prussia, as events which could not have been expected if Great-Britain had not manifested a sea∣sonable spirit and vigour, in defence and assistance of her ancient allies, and in maintaining the liberties of Europe. He said, the honour and interest of
<PB N="630" REF="6330"/>
his crown and kingdoms, the success of the war with Spain, the re-establish∣ment of the ballance and tranquillity of Europe, would greatly depend on the prudence and vigour of their resolutions. The marquis of Tweedale moved for an address of thanks, which was opposed by the earl of Chesterfield, for the reasons so often urged on the same occasion; but supported by the lord C. on his new-adopted maxims, with those specious arguments which he could at all times produce, delivered with amazing serenity and assurance. The motion was adopted, and the address presented to his majesty. About this period a treaty of mutual defence and guarantee between his majesty and the king of Prussia, was signed at Westminster. In the house of commons Mr. Lyttleton made a motion for reviving the place-bill; but it was opposed by a great num∣ber of members who had formerly been strenuous advocates for this measure, and rejected upon a division. This was also the fate of a motion made to renew the inquiry into the conduct of Robert earl of Orford. As many strong presumptions of guilt had appeared against him in the reports of the se∣cret committee, the nation had reason to expect that this proposal would have been embraced by a great majority; but, several members, who in the preced∣ing session had been loud in their demands of justice, now shamefully contri∣buted in stifling the inquiry.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXV.</HEAD>
<P>When the house of lords took into consideration the several esti∣mates of the expence occasioned by the forces in the pay of Great-Britain, earl Stanhope, at the close of an elegant speech, moved for an address to beseech and advise his majesty, that in compassion to his people, loaded already with such numerous and heavy taxes, such large and growing debts, and greater annual expences than the nation at any time before had ever sustained, he would exo∣nerate his subjects of the charge and burthen of those mercenaries who were taken into the service last year, without the advice or consent of parliament. The motion was supported by the earl of Sandwich, who took occasion to speak with great contempt of Hanover, and in mentioning the royal family, seemed to forget that decorum which the subject required. He had indeed reason to talk with asperity on the contract by which the Hanoverians had been taken into the pay of Great-Britain. Levy-money was charged to the account, though they were engaged for one year only; and though not a single regiment had been raised on this occasion: they had been levied for the security of the electorate; and would have been maintained if England had never engaged in the affairs of the continent. The duke of Bedford enlarged upon the same subject. He said, it had been suspected, nor was the suspicion without foundation, that the mea∣sures of the English ministry had long been regulated by the interest of his ma∣jesty's electoral territories: that these had been long considered as a gulph into which the treasures of Great-Britain had been thrown: that the state of Hanover had been changed without any visible cause, since the accession of its princes to the throne of England: affluence had begun to wanton in their towns, and gold to glitter in their cottages, without the discovery of mines, or the increase of their commerce; and new dominions had been purchased, of which the value was never payed from the revenues of Hanover. The motion was hunted down by the new minister, the patriot lord Bathurst, and the earl of Bath, which last nobleman declared, that he considered it as an act of cowardice and meanness, to fall passively down the stream of popularity, to suffer his reason and
<PB N="631" REF="6340"/>
integrity to be overborne by the noise of vulgar clamours, which had been raised against the measures of the government by the low arts of exaggeration, fallacious reasonings, and partial representations. This is the very language which Sir Robert Walpole had often used against Mr. Pulteney and his confede∣rates in the house of commons. The associates of the new secretary pleaded the cause of Hanover, and insisted upon the necessity of a land-war against France, with all the vehemence of declamation. Their suggestions were answered; their conduct was severely stigmatized by the earl of Chesterfield, who observed, that the assembling an army in Flanders, without the concurrence of the states-general, or any other power engaged by treaty, or bound by interest, to sup∣port the queen of Hungary, was a rash and ridiculous measure: that the taking sixteen thousand Hanoverians into British pay, without consulting the parlia∣ment, seemed highly derogatory to the rights and dignity of the great council of the nation, and a very dangerous precedent to future times: that these troops could not be employed against the emperor, whom they had already recognized: that the arms and wealth of Britain alone were altogether insufficient to raise the house of Austria to its former strength, dominion, and influence: that the assembling an army in Flanders would engage the nation as principals in an expensive and ruinous war, with a power which it ought not to provoke, and could not pretend to withstand in that manner: that while Great Britain ex∣hausted herself almost to ruin, in pursuance of schemes founded on engage∣ments to the queen of Hungary, the electorate of Hanover, though under the same engagements, and governed by the same prince, did not appear to con∣tribute any thing as an ally to her assistance, but was payed by Great-Britain for all the forces it had sent into the field, at a very exorbitant price: that no∣thing could be more absurd and iniquitous than to hire these mercenaries, while a numerous army lay inactive at home; and the nation groaned under such intolera∣ble burthens. <Q>“It may be proper, added he, to repeat what may be forgotten in the multitude of other objects, that this nation, after having exalted the elector of Hanover from a state of obscurity to the crown, is condemned to hire the troops of that electorate to fight their own cause; to hire them at a rate which was never demanded before, and to pay levy-money for them, though it is known to all Europe, that they were not raised for this occasion.”</Q> All the partisans of the old ministry joined in the opposition to earl Stanhope's motion, which was rejected by the majority. Then the earl of Scarborough moved for an address, to approve of the measures which had been taken on the continent; and this was likewise carried by dint of number. It was not, however, a very eligible victory: what they gained in the parliament they lost with the people. The new ministers became more odious than their predecessors; and people began to think that public virtue was an empty name.</P>

<P>But the most severe opposition they underwent, was in their endea∣vours to support a bill which they had concerted, and which had passed through the house of commons with great precipitation: it repealed certain duties on spiri∣tuous liquors, and lincences for retailing these liquors; and imposed others at an easier rate. When those severe duties, amounting almost to a prohibition, were imposed, the populace of London were sunk into the most brutal degeneracy, by drinking to excess the pernicious spirit called Gin, which was sold so cheap, that the lowest class of the people could afford to indulge themselves in one
<PB N="632" REF="6350"/>
continued state of intoxication; to the destruction of all morals, industry, and order. Such a shameful degree of profligacy prevailed, that the retailers of this poisonous compound set up painted boards in public, inviting people to be drunk for the small expence of one penny; assuring them, they might be dead drunk for two-pence, and have straw for nothing. They accordingly pro∣vided cellars and places strewed with straw, to which they conveyed those wretches who were overwhelmed with intoxication. In these dismal caverns they lay until they recovered some use of their faculties, and then they had re∣course to the same mischievous potion; thus consuming their health, and ruin∣ing their families in hideous receptacles of the most filthy vice, refounding with riot, execration, and blasphemy. Such beastly practices too plainly denoted a total want of all police and civil regulation, and would have reflected disgrace upon the most barbarous community. In order to restrain this evil, which was become intolerable, the legislature enacted that law which we have already men∣tioned. But the populace soon broke through all restraint. Though no licence was obtained, and no duty payed, the liquor continued to be sold in all corners of the streets: informers were intimidated by the threats of the people; and the justices of the peace, either from indolence or corruption, neglected to put the law in execution. The new ministers foresaw that a great revenue would accrue to the crown from a repeal of this act; and this measure they thought they might the more decently take, as the law had proved ineffectual: for, it appeared, that the consumption of gin had considerably increased every year since those heavy duties were imposed. They therefore pretended, that should the price of the liquor be moderately raised, and licences granted at twenty shillings each to the retailers, the lowest class of people would be debarred the use of it to excess; their morals would of consequence be mended, and a considerable sum of money might be raised for the support of the war, by mortgaging the revenue arising from the duty and the licences. Upon these maxims the new bill was founded, and passed through the lower house without opposition; but, among the peers it produced the most obstinate dispute which had happened since the beginning of this parliament. The first assault it sustained was from lord Hervey, who had been divested of his post of privy-seal, which was bestowed on lord Gower; and these two noblemen exchanged principles from that instant. The first was hardened into a sturdy patriot, the other suppled into an obsequious courtier. Lord Hervey, on this occasion, made a florid harangue, upon the pernicious effects of that destructive spirit they were about to let loose upon their fellow-creatures. Several prelates expatiated on the same topics; but, the earl of Chesterfield attacked the bill with the united powers of reason, wit, and ridicule. The lord Carteret, the lord Bathurst, and the earl of Bath, were numbered among its advocates; and shrewd arguments were advanced on both sides of the question. After very long, warm, and repeated debates, the bill passed without amendments, though the whole bench of bishops voted against it; and we can∣not help owning, that it has not been attended with those dismal consequences which the lords in the opposition foretold. When the question was put for committing this bill, and the earl of Chesterfield saw the bishops join in his division, <Q>“I am in doubt, said he, whether I have not got on the other side of the question; for I have not had the honour to divide with so many lawn∣sleeves for several years.”</Q></P>

<P>By the report of the secret committee it appeared, that the then minister had commenced prosecutions against the mayors of boroughs who opposed his influence in the elections of members of parliament. These prose∣cutions were founded on ambiguities in charters, or trivial informalities in the choice of magistrates. An appeal on such a process was brought into the house of lords; and this evil falling under consideration, a bill was prepared for securing the independency of corporations: but, as it tended to diminish the influence of the ministry, they argued against it with their usual eagerness and success; and it was rejected on a division. The mutiny-bill and several others passed both houses. The commons granted supplies to the amount of six mil∣lions, raised by the land-tax, the malt-tax, duties on spirituous liquors, and licences, and a loan from the sinking-fund. In two years the national debt had suffered an increase of two millions four hundred thousand pounds. On the<NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1743</NOTE> twenty-first day of April the session was closed in the usual manner. The king in his speech to both houses told them, that at the requisition of the queen of Hungary, he had ordered his army, in conjunction with the Austrians, to pass the Rhine for her support and assistance: that he had continued one squa∣dron of ships in the Mediterranean, and another in the West-Indies. He thanked the commons for the ample supplies they had granted; and, declared, it was the fixed purpose of his heart, to promote the true interst and happi∣ness of his kingdoms. Immediately after the prorogation of parliament he embarked for Germany, accompanied by the duke of Cumberland, the lord Carteret, and other persons of distinction.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>At this period the queen of Hungary seemed to triumph over all her enemies. The French were driven out of Bohemia and part of the Upper Palatinate; and their forces under marechal Broglio were posted on the Danube. Prince Charles of Lorraine, at the head of the Austrian army, entered Bavaria; and in April obtained a victory over a body of Bavarians at Braunau: at the same time three bodies of Croatians penetrating through the passes of the Tyroleze, ravaged the open country to the very gates of Munich. The emperor pressed the French general to hazard a battle; but, he refused to run this risque, though he had received a strong reinforcement from France. His Imperial majesty thinking himself unsafe in Munich, retired to Augsburgh, and marechal Seckendorf retreated with the Bavarian troops to Ingoldstadt, where he was afterwards joined by marechal Broglio, whose troops had in this retreat been pursued and terribly harrassed by the Austrian cavalry and hussars. Prince Charles had now a free communication with Munich, which now for the third time fell into the hands of the queen of Hungary. Her arms likewise reduced Friedberg and Landsperg; while prince Charles continued to pursue the French to Dona∣wert, where they were joined by twelve thousand men from the Rhine. Broglio still avoided an engagement, and retreated before the enemy to Hailbron. The emperor being thus abandoned by his allies, and stripped of all his dominions, repaired to Franckfort, where he lived in indigence and obscurity. He now made advances towards an accommodation with the queen of Hungary. His general Seckendorf had an interview with count Khevenhuller at the convent of Lowersconfield, where a convention was signed, importing, That the emperor should remain neuter during the continuance of the present war; and, That his troops should be quartered in Franconia: That the queen of Hungary should keep possession of Bavaria till the peace: That Braunau and Scharding
<PB N="634" REF="6370"/>
should be delivered up to the Austrians: That the French garrison of Ingoldstadt should be permitted to withdraw, and be replaced by Bavarians; but, that the Au∣strian generals should be put in possession of all the artillery, magazines, and war∣like stores belonging to the French, which should be found in the place. The governors of Fgra and Ingoldstadt refusing to acquiesce in this capitulation, the Austrians had recourse to the operations of war; and both places were reduced. In Ingoldstadt they found all the emperor's domestic treasure, jewels, plate, pictures, cabinets, and curiosities, with the archives of the house of Bavaria, the most valuable effects belonging to the nobility of that electorate, a prodigious train of artillery, and a vast quantity of provisions, arms, and ammunition.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIX.</HEAD>
<P>The French king, bassled in all the efforts he had hitherto made for the support of the emperor, ordered his minister at Franckfort to deliver a declaration to the diet, professing himself extremely well pleased to hear they intended to interpose their mediation for terminating the war. He said, he was no less satisfied with the treaty of neutrality which the emperor had concluded with the queen of Hungary; an event of which he was no sooner informed, than he had ordered his troops to return to the frontiers of his dominions, that the Germanic body might be convinced of his equity and moderation. To this declaration the queen of Hungary answered in a rescript, that the design of France was to embarrass her affairs, and deprive her of the assistance of her allies: that the elector of Bavaria could not be considered as a neutral party in his own cause: that the mediation of the empire could only produce a peace either with or without the concurrence of France: that in the former case no solid peace could be expected; in the latter, it was easy to foresee, that France would pay no regard to a peace in which she should have no concern. She affirm∣ed, that the aim of the French king was solely to gain time to repair his losses, that he might afterwards revive the troubles of the empire. The elector of Mentz, who had favoured the emperor, was now dead, and his successor inclined to the Austrian interest. He allowed this rescript to be entered in the journal of the diet, together with the protests which had been made when the vote of Bohemia was suppressed in the late election. The emperor complained in a circular letter of this transaction as a stroke levelled at his Imperial dignity; and it gave rise to a warm dispute among the members of the Germanic body. Several princes resented the haughty conduct, and began to be alarmed at the success of the house of Austria; and others pitied the deplorable situation of the emperor. The kings of Great-Britain and Prussia, as electors of Hanover and Brandenburgh, espoused opposite sides in this contest. His Prussian majesty protested against the investiture of the dutchy of Saxe-Lawenburgh, claimed by the king of Great-Britain: he had an interview with general Seckendorf at Anspach, and was said to have privately visited the emperor at Franckfort.</P>

<P>The troops which the king of Great Britain had assembled in the Netherlands, began their march for the Rhine in the latter end of February; and in May they incamped near Hoech on the river Mayne, under the command of the earl of Stair, who sent major-general Bland to Franckfort with a compliment to the emperor, assuring him, in the name of his Britannic majesty, that the respect owing to his dignity should not be violated, nor the place of his residence disturbed. Notwithstanding this assurance the emperor retired to Munich, though he was afterwards compelled to return by the success of the
<PB N="635" REF="6380"/>
Austrians in Bavaria. The French king, in order to prevent the junction of the British forces with prince Charles of Lorraine, ordered the marechal de Noailles to assemble sixty thousand men upon the Mayne; while Coigny was sent into Alsace with a numerous army, to defend that province and oppose prince Charles, should he attempt to pass the Rhine. The marechal de Noailles having secured the towns of Spire, Worms, and Oppenheim, passed the Rhine in the beginning of June, and posted himself on the east side of that river, above Franckfort. The earl of Stair advanced towards him, and encamped at Kil∣lenbach, between the river Mayne and the forest of D'Armstadt; from this situation he made a motion to Aschaffenburgh, with a view to secure the navi∣gation of the Upper Mayne; but, he was anticipated by the enemy, who lay on the other side of the river, and had taken possession of the posts above, so as to intercept all supplies. They were posted on the other side of the river, opposite to the allies, whose camp they overlooked; and they found means, by their parties and other precautions, to cut off the communication by water between Franckfort and the confederates. The duke of Cumberland had already come to make his first campaign, and his majesty arrived in the camp on the ninth day of June. He found his army, amounting to about forty thousand men, in danger of starving: he received intelligence, that a reinforcement of twelve thousand Hanoverians and Hessians had reached Hanau; and he resolved to march thither, both with a view to effect the junction, and to procure provision for his forces. With this view he decamped on the twenty-sixth day of June. He had no sooner quitted Aschaffenburgh than it was seized by the French; and he had not marched above three leagues, when he perceived the enemy, to the number of thirty thousand, had passed the river farther down, and were drawn up in order of battle at the village of Dettingen, to dispute his passage. Thus he found himself cooped up in a very dangerous situation. The enemy had possessed themselves of Aschaffenburgh behind, so as to prevent his retreat: his troops were confined in a narrow plain, bounded by hills and woods on the right, flanked on the left by the river Mayne, on the opposite side of which the French had erected batteries that annoyed the allies on their march; and in the front a considerable part of the French army was drawn up, with a narrow pass before them, the village of Dettingen on their right, a wood on the left, and a morass in the center. Thus environed, the confederates must either have fought at a very great disadvantage, or surrendered themselves prisoners of war, had not the duke de Gramont, who commanded the enemy, been instigated by the spirit of madness to foregoe these advantages. He passed the defile, and advancing towards the allies, a battle ensued. The French horse charged with great impetuosity, and some regiments of British cavalry were put in disorder; but, the infantry of the allies behaved with such intrepidity and deliberation, under the eye of their sovereign, as soon determined the fate of the day: the French were obliged to give way, and repass the Mayne with great precipita∣tion, having lost about five thousand men killed, wounded, or taken. Had they been properly pursued before they recollected themselves from their first confusion, in all probability they would have sustained a total overthrow. The earl of Stair proposed, that a body of cavalry should be detached on this service; but, his advice was over-ruled. The loss of the allies in this action amounted to two thousand men. The generals Clayton and Monroy were killed: the
<PB N="636" REF="6390"/>
duke of Cumberland, who exhibited uncommon proofs of courage, was shot through the calf of the leg: the earl of Albemarle, general Huske, and several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> offers of dist nction, were wounded. The king exposed his person to a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fire of cannon as well as musquetry: he rode between the first and second lines with his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ord drawn, and encouraged the troops to fight for the honour of England. Immediately after the action he continued his march to Hanau, where he was joined by the reinforcement. The earl of Stair sent a trumpet to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> de Neailles, recommending to his protection the sick and wounded that were left on the field of battle; and these the French general treated with great care and tenderness. Such generosity softens the rigours of war, and does honour to humanity.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLI.</HEAD>
<P>The two armies continued on different sides of the river till the twelfth day of July, when the French general receiving intelligence, that prince Charles of Lorraine had approached the Neckar, he suddenly retired, and repassed the Rhine between Worms and Oppenheim. The king of Great-Britain was visited by prince Charles and count Khevenhuller at Hanau, where the future operations of the campaign were regulated. On the twenty-seventh day of August, the allied army passed the Rhine at Mentz, and the king fixed his head-quarters in the episcopal palace at Worms. Here the forces lay encamped till the latter end of September, when they advanced to Spire, where they were joined by twenty thousand Dutch auxiliaries from the Netherlands. Marechal Noallies having retreated into Upper Alsace, the allies took possession of Germersheim, and demolished the intrenchments which the enemy had raised on the Quei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h; than they returned to Mentz, and in October were distributed into winter-quarters, after an inactive campaign that redounded very little to the honour of those by whom the motions of the army were conducted. In September a treaty had been concluded at Worms between his Britannic majesty, the king of Sardinia, and the queen of Hungary. She engaged to maintain thirty thousand men in Italy: the king of Sardinia obliged himself to employ forty thousand infantry and five thousand horse, in consideration of his commanding the combined army, and receiving an annual subsidy of two hundred thousand pounds from Great-Britain. As a further gratification, the queen yielded to him the city of Placentia, with several districts in the dutchy of Pavia, and in the Novarese; and all her right and pretensions to Final, at present possessed by the republic of Genoa, which, they hoped, would give it up on being repayed the purchase-money, which amounted to three hundred thou∣sand pounds. This sum the king of England promised to disburse; and moreover to maintain a strong squadron in the Mediterranean, the commander of which should act in concert with his Sardinian majesty. Finally, the contracting powers agreed, That Final should be constituted a free-port like that of Leghorn. Nothing could be more unjust than this treaty, by which the Genoese were negotiated but of their property. They had purchased the marquisate of Final of the late emperor for a valuable consideration, and the purchase had been guaranteed by Great-Britain. It could not therefore be expected, that they would part with this acquisition to a prince whose power they thought already too formidable; especially, on condition of its being made a free-port, to the prejudice of their own commerce. They presented remonstrances against this article, by their ministers at the courts of London, Vienna, and Turin; and as
<PB N="637" REF="6400"/>
very little regard was payed to their representations, they threw themselves into the arms of France and Spain for protection.</P>

<HEAD>§ XLII.</HEAD>
<P>After the battle of Dettingen colonel Mentzel, at the head of a large body of irregulars belonging to the queen of Hungary, made an irruption into Lorraine, part of which they ravaged without mercy. In September prince Charles, with the Austrian army, entered the Brisgaw, and attempted to pass the Rhine; but, marachal Colgny had taken such precautions for guarding it on the other side, that he was obliged to abandon his design, and marching back into the Upper Palatinate, quartered his troops in that country and in Bavaria. By this time the earl of Stair had sollicited and obtained leave to resign his com∣mand. He had for some time thought himself neglected; and was unwilling that his reputation should suffer on account of measures in which he had no concern. In October the king of Great-Britain returned to Hanover, and the army separated. The troops in British pay marched back to the Netherlands, and the rest took the route to their respective countries. The states-general still wavered between their own immediate interest and their desire to support the house of Austria. At length, however, they supplied her with a subsidy, and ordered twenty thousand men to march to her assistance, notwithstanding the intrigues of the marquis de Fenelon, the French ambassador at the Hague, and the declaration of the king of Prussia, who disapproved of this measure, and refused them a passage through his territories, to the Rhine.</P>

<P>Sweden was filled with discontents, and divided into factions. The generals Bodenbrock and Lewenhaupt were beheaded, having been sacrificed as scape goats for the ministry. Some unsuccessful efforts by sea and land were made against the Russians. At last the peace of Abo was concluded; and the duke of Holstein Utin, uncle to the successor of the Russian throne, was chosen as next heir to the crown of Sweden. A party had been formed in favour of the prince of Denmark; and the order of the peasants actually elected him as successor. The debates in the college of nobles rose to a very dangerous degree of animosity, and were appeased by an harangue in Swedish verse, which one of the senators pronounced. The peasants yielded the point, and the succession was settled on the duke of Holstein. Denmark, instigated by French counsels, began to make preparations of war against Sweden; but, a body of Russian auxiliaries arriving in that kingdom, under the command of general Keith, and the czarina declaring she would assist the Swedes with her whole force, the king of Denmark thought proper to disarm. It had been an old maxim of French policy to embroil the courts of the North, that they might be too much employed at home to intermeddle in the affairs of Germany, while France was at war with the house of Austria. The good understanding between the czarina and the queen of Hungary, was at this period destroyed, in consequence of a conspiracy which had been formed by some persons of distinction at the court of Petersburgh, for removing the empress Elizabeth, and recalling the princess Anne to the administration. This design being discovered, the principal conspirators were corporally punished, and sent in exile to Siberia. The marquis de Botta, the Austrian minister, who had resided at the court of the czarina, was suspected of having been concerned in the plot; though the grounds of this suspicion did not appear until after he was recalled and sent as ambassador to the court of Berlin. The empress demanded satisfaction of the
<PB N="638" REF="6410"/>
queen of Hungary, who appointed commissioners to inquire into his conduct, and he was acquitted; but the czarina was not at all satisfied of his innocence. In February a defensive treaty of alliance was concluded between this princess and the king of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>By this time France was deprived of her ablest minister in the death of the cardinal de Fleury, who had for many years managed the affairs of that kingdom. He is said to have possessed a lively genius, and an insinuat∣ing address; to have been regular in his deportment, and moderate in his disposition; but at the same time he has been branded as deceitful, dissembling, and vindictive. His scheme of politics was altogether pacific: he endea∣voured to accomplish his purposes by raising and fomenting intrigues at foreign courts: he did not seem to pay much regard to the military glory of France<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he too much neglected the naval power of that kingdom. Since Broglio was driven out of Germany, the French court affected uncommon moderation. They pretended, that their troops had only acted as auxiliaries while they remained in the empire; but, being apprehensive of an irruption into their own dominions, they declared, that those troops were no longer to be considered in that light, but as subjects acting in the service of France. The campaign in Italy proved unfavourable to the Spaniards. In the beginning of February count Gages, who commanded the Spanish army in the Bolognese, amounting to four and twenty thousand men, passed the Panaro in the beginning of February, and advanced to Campo-Santo, where he encountered the Imperial and Piedmontese forces, commanded by count Traun and count Aspremont. The strength of the two armies was nearly equal. The action was obstinate and bloody, though indecisive. The Spaniards lost about four thousand men, killed, wounded, or taken. The damage sustained by the confederates was not quite so great. Some cannon and colours were taken on both sides; and each claimed the victory. Count Gages repassed the Panaro; retreated suddenly from Bologna, and marched to Rimini in the ecclesiastical state, where he fortified his camp in an advantageous situation, after having suffered severely by desertion. Count Traun remained inactive in the Modenese till September, when he resigned his command to prince Lobkowitz. This general entered the Bolognese in October, and then advanced towards count Gages, who, with his forces, now reduced to seven thousand, retreated to Fano; but afterwards took possession of Pesaro, and fortified all the passes of the river Foglia. The sea∣son was far advanced before the Spanish troops, commanded by Don Philip, in Savoy, entered upon action. In all probability, the courts of Versailles and Madrid carried on some private negotiation with the king of Sardinia. This expedient failing, Don Philip decamped from Chamberri in the latter end of August, and defiling through Dauphiné towards Briançon, was joined by the prince of Conti, at the head of twenty thousand French auxiliaries. Thus reinforced, he attacked the Piedmontese lines at Chateau Dauphiné; but was repulsed in several attempts, and obliged to retreat with considerable loss. The French established their winter-quarters in Dauphiné and Provence; and the Spaniards maintained their footing in Savoy.</P>

<P>The British fleet commanded by admiral Matthews overawed all the states that bordered on the Mediterranean. About the end of June under∣standing, that fourteen xebecks, loaded with artillery and ammunition for the
<PB N="639" REF="6420"/>
Spanish army, had arrived at Genoa, he sailed thither from the road of Hieres, and demanded of the republic, that they would either oblige these vessels with the stores to quit their harbour, or sequester their lading until a general peace should be established. After some dispute it was agreed, that the cannon and stores should be deposited in the castle of Bonifacio, situated on a rock at the south end of Corsica: and, that the xebecks should have leave to retire without molestation. The Corsicans had some years before revolted, and shaken off the dominion of the Genoese, under which their island had remained for many centuries. They found themselves oppressed, and resolved to assert their free∣dom. They conferred the sovereign authority on a German adventurer, who was solemnly proclaimed by the name of king Theodore. He had supplied them with some arms and ammunition which he had brought from Tunis; and amused them with promises of being assisted by foreign powers in retrieving their independency; but as these promises were not performed, they treated him so roughly, that he had thought proper to quit the island, and they submitted again to their old masters. The troubles of Corsica were now revived. Theodore revisited his kingdom, and was recognized by the principal chiefs of the island He published a manifesto: he granted a general pardon to all his subjects who should return to their obedience; and prerended to be countenanced and sup∣ported by the king of Great-Britain and the queen of Hungary. He was certainly thought a proper instrument to perplex and harrass the Genoese, and supplied at this juncture with a sum of money, to purchase arms for the Corsicans; but, a change soon happened in the British ministry, and then he was suffered to relapse into his original obscurity. Admiral Matthews, though he did not undertake any expedition of importance against the maritime towns of Spain, continued to assert the British empire at sea through the whole extent of the Mediterranean. The Spanish army under Don Philip was no sooner in motion, than the English admiral ordered some troops and cannon to be disembarked for the security of Villa-Franca. Some stores having been landed at Civita-Vecchia for the use of the Spanish forces under count Gages, Matthews interpreted this transaction into a violation of the neutrality which the pope had professed; and sent thither a squadron to bombard the place. The city of Rome was filled with consternation; and the pope had recourse to the good offices of his Sar∣dinian majesty, in consequence of which the English squadron was ordered to withdraw. The captains of single cruising ships, by their activity and vigilance, wholly interrupted the commerce of Spain, cannonaded and burned some towns on the sea-side, and kept the whole coast in continual alarm <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In May a dreadful plague broke out at Messina in Sicily. It was imported in cotton and other commodities brought from the Morea; and swept off such a multitude of people, that the city was almost depopulated: all the galley-slaves who were employed in burying the dead, perished by the contagion; and this was the fate of many priests and monks who administered to those who were infected. The dead bodies lay in heaps on the streets, corrupting the air, and adding fresh fuel to the rage of the pestilence. Numbers died miserably for want of proper attendance and ne∣cessaries; and all was horror and desolation. At the beginning of winter it ceased, after having destroyed near fifty thousand inhabitants of Mes∣sina, and of the garrisons in the citadel and castle. It was prevented from spreading in Sicily by a strong barricado drawn from Melazzo to Taor∣mina; but, it was conveyed to Reggio in Cala∣bria, by the avarice of a broker of that place, who bought some goods at Messina. The king of Naples immediately ordered lines to be formed, together with a chain of troops, which cut off all commu∣nication between that place and the rest of the continent.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>In the West-Indies some unsuccessful efforts were made by an English squadron, commanded by commodore Knowles. He attacked La Gueira on the coast of Carraccas, in the month of February; but, met with such a warm reception, that he was obliged to desist, and make the best of his way for the Dutch island Curacoa, where he repaired the damage he had sus∣tained. His ships being refitted, he made another attempt upon Porto-Cavallo in April, which like the former miscarried. Twelve hundred marines being landed in the neighbourhood of the place, were seized with such a pannic, that it was found necessary to reimbark them without delay. Then the commodore abandoned the enterprize, and sailed back to his station at the Leeward-Islands, without having added much to his reputation either as to conduct or resolution. On the continent of America the operations of the war were very inconsidera∣ble. General Oglethorpe having received intelligence, that the Spaniards prepared for another invasion from St. Augustine, assembled a body of Indians as a reinforcement to part of his own regiment, with the Highlanders and rangers; and in the spring began his march, in order to anticipate the enemy. He encamped for some time in the neighbourhood of St. Augustine, by way of defiance: but they did not think proper to hazard an engagement; and as he was in no condition to undertake a siege, he returned to Georgia. In October the princess Louisa, youngest daughter of his Britannic majesty, was married by proxy at Hanover, to the prince-royal of Denmark, who met her at Altena, and conducted her to Copenhagen.</P>

<P>THE discontents of England were artfully inflamed by antiministerial writers, who not only exaggerated the burthens of the people, and drew frightful pictures of the distress and misery, which they said, impended over the nation, but also employed the arts of calumny and misrepresentation, to excite a jealousy and national quarrel between the English and Hanoverians. They affirmed, that in the last campaign the British general had been neglected and despised; while the counsels of foreign officers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inferior to him in capacity, quality, and reputation, had been followed, to the prejudice of the common cause: that the British troops sustained daily insults from their own mercenaries, who were indulged with particular marks of royal savour: that the sover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign himself appeared at D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tting<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in a Hanoverian searr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: and, that his electoral troops were of very little service in that engagement.

<P>In the house of commons they sustained divers attacks.

The grants specified in the votes amounted to six millions and an hair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to this sum were added three millions and an half payed to the sinking fund in perpetual taxes; so that this year's expence rose to ten millions.
<PB N="643" REF="6460"/>
The funds established for the annual charge were the land and malt-taxes, one million payed by the East-India company for the renewal of their charter, twelve hundred thousand pounds by annuities, one million from the sinking fund, six and thirty thousand pounds from the coinage; and six hundred thousand pounds by a lottery: an expedient which for some time had been annually repeated; and which, in a great measure, contributed to debauch the morals of the public, by introducing a spirit of gaming, destructive of all industry and virtue.</P>

<P>The dissensions of the British parliament were suddenly suspended by an event that seemed to unite both parties in the prosecution of the same measures. This was the intelligence of an intended invasion. By the parliamentary disputes, the loud clamours, and the general dissatisfaction of the people in Great-Britain, the French ministry were persuaded, that the nation was ripe for revolt. This belief was corroborated by the assertions of their emissaries in dif∣ferent parts of Great-Britain and Ireland. These were papists and jacobites of strong prejudices and warm imaginations, who saw things through the medium of passion and party, and spoke rather from extravagant zeal than from sober conviction. They gave the court of Versailles to understand, that if the chevalier de St. George, or his eldest son Charles-Edward, should appear at the head of a French army in Great-Britain, a revolution would instantly follow in his favour. This intimation was agreeable to cardinal de Tencin, who had succeeded Fleury as prime-minister of France He was of a violent enterprising temper. He had been recommended to the purple by the chevalier de St. George, and was warmly attached to the Stuart family. His ambition was slattered with a prospect of giving a king to Great-Britain, of performing such eminent service to his benefactor, and of restoring to the throne of their ancestors, a family connected by the ties of blood with all the greatest princes of Europe. He foresaw, that even if his aim should miscarry, a descent upon Great-Britain wo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld make a considerable diversion from the continent in favour of France, and embroil and embarrass his Britannic majesty, who was the chief support of the house of Austria and all its allies. Actuated by these motives, he concerted measures with the chevalier de St. Geo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge at Rome, who being too much advanced in years to engage personally in such an expedition, agreed to delegate his preten∣sions and authority to his son Charles, a youth of promising talents, sage, secret, brave, and enterprising; amiable in his person, grave, and even reserved in his deportment. He approved himself in the sequel composed and moderate in success, wonderfully firm in adversity; and, though tenderly nursed in all the delights of an effeminate country, and gentle climate, patient almost beyond belief of cold, hunger, and fatigue. Such was the adventurer now des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined to fulfil the hope which the French minister had conceived from the projected invasion of Great-Britain.</P>

The British ministry being apprised of his arrival in France, at once comprehended the destination of the armaments pre∣pared <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Brest and Boulogne.

But he was given to understand, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> christian majesty would not explain himself on that subject, until the king of England should have given satisfaction on the repeated complaints which had been made to him, touching the infractions of those very treaties which had been so often violated by his orders.

<P>Mean while the French court proceeded with their preparations, at Boulogne and Dunkirk, under the eye of the young pretender; and seven thou∣sand men were actually embarked. M. de Roquefeuille sailed up the channel as far as Dungeness, a promontory on the coast of Kent, after having de∣tached M. de Barreil with five ships, to hasten the embarkation at Dunkirk. While the French admiral anchored off Dungeness, he perceived, on the twenty-fourth day of February, the British fleet under Sir John Norris, doubling the South-Foreland from the Downs; and, though the wind was against him, taking the opportunity of the tide to come up and engage the French squa∣dron. Roquefeuille, who little expected such a visit, could not be altogether composed, considering the great superiority of his enemies: but the tide failing, the English admiral was obliged to anchor two leagues short of the enemy. In this interval, M. Roquefeuille called a council of war, in which it was determined to avoid an engagement, weigh anchor at sunset, and make the best of their way to the place from whence they had set sail. This resolution was favoured by a very hard gale of wind, which began to blow from the north-east, and carried them down the channel with incredible expedition. But the same storm which, in all probability, saved their fleet from destruction, utterly dis∣concerted the design of invading England. A great number of their transports was driven ashore and destroyed, and the rest so damaged that they could not be speedily repaired. The English were now masters at sea, and their coast was so well guarded that the enterprize could not be prosecuted with any probabi∣lity of success. The French generals nominated to serve in this expedition re∣turned to Paris, and the pretender resolved to wait a more favourable oppor∣tunity. The French king no longer preserved any measures with the court of London: the British resident at Paris was given to understand, that a decla∣ration of war must ensue; and this was actually published on the twentieth day of March. The king of Great-Britain was taxed with having dissuaded the court of Vienna from entertaining any thoughts of an accommodation; with having infringed the convention of Hanover; with having exercised piracy upon the subjects of France, and even blocked up the harbour of Toulon. On the thirty-first day of March, a like denunciation of war against France was published at London, amidst the acclamations of the people.</P>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An. Ch. 1744.</NOTE> The commons of England, in order to evince their loyalty, brought in a bill denouncing the penalties of high-treason against those who should maintain correspondence with the sons of the pretender. In the upper house, lord Hardwicke the chancellor moved, that a clause should be inserted, ex∣tending the crime of treason to the posterity of the offenders, during the lives of the pretender's sons. The motion, which was supported by the whole strength of the ministry, produced a warm debate, in which the duke of Bed∣ford, the earl of Chesterfield, the lords Talbot and Harvey, argued against it in the most pathetic manner, as an illiberal expedient, contrary to the dictates

<HEAD>§ VIII.</HEAD>
<P>By this time an action had happened in the Mediterranean between the British f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet commanded by admiral Matthews, and the combined squadrons of France and Spain, which had been for some time blocked up in the harbour of Toulon. On the ninth day of February they were perceived standing out of the road, to the number of four and thirty sail: the English admiral imme∣diately weighed from Hieres-bay; and on the eleventh, part of the fleets engaged. Matthews attacked the Spanish admiral Don Navarro, whose ship the Real was a first-rate, mounted with above an hundred guns. The rear∣admiral Rowley singled out M. de Court who commanded the French squadron; and a very few captains followed the example of their commanders: but vice admiral Lestock, with his whole division, remained at a great distance a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tern; and several captains that were immediately under the eye of Matthews, behaved in such a manner as reflected disgrace upon their country. The whole transaction was conducted without order or deliberation. The French and Spaniards would have willingly avoided an engagement, as the British squadron was superior to them in strength and number. M. de Court therefore made the be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t of his way towards the Streights mouth, probably with intention to join the Brest squadron: but, he had orders to protect the Spanish fleet; and as they sailed heavily, he was obliged to wait for them, at the hazard of maintain∣ing a battle with the English. Thus circumstanced he made sail and lay to by turns; so that the British admiral could not engage them in proper order; and as they outsailed his ships, he began to fear they w#uld escape him altogether should he wait for vice-admiral Lestock, who was so far astern. Under this apprehension he made the signal for engaging, while that for the line of battle was still dis∣played; and this incons<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tency naturally introduced confusion. The fight was maintained by the few who engaged with great vivacity. The Real being quite d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>bled, and lying like a wreck upon the water, Mr. Matthews sent a fireship to des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roy her; but, the expe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt did not take effect. The ship ordered to cover this machine did not obey the signal; so that the captain of the fireship was exposed to the whole fire of the enemy. Nevertheless, he continued to advance until he found the vessel sinking; and being within a few yards of the Real, he set fire to the fuses. The ship was immediately in flames, in the midst of which he and his lieutenant, with twelve men, perished. This was like∣wise
<PB N="647" REF="6500"/>
the fate of a Spanish launch, which had been manned with fifty sailors to pre∣vent the fireship from running on board the Real. One ship of the line, belonging to the Spanish squadron, struck to captain Hawke, who sent a lieutenant to take possession of her: she was afterwards retaken by the French squadron; but was found so disabled, that they left her deserted, and she was next day burned by the order of admiral Matthews. At night the action ceased; and the ad∣miral found his own ship so much damaged, that he moved his flag into another. Captain Cornwal fell in the engagement, after having exhibited a remarkable proof of courage and intrepidity: but, the loss of men was very inconsiderable. Next day the enemy appeared to leeward, and the admiral gave chace till night, when he brought to, that he might be joined by the ships a-stern. They were perc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ived again on the thirteenth at a considerable distance, and pursued till the evening. In the morning of the fourteenth, twenty sail of them were seen distinctly, and Lestock with his division had gained ground of them consider∣ably, by noon; but, admiral Matthews displayed the signal for leaving off chace, and bore away for Port-mahon, to repair the damage he had sustained. Mean while the combined squadrons continued their course towards the coast of Spain. M. de Court, with his division, anchored in the road of Alicant, and Don Navarro sailed into the harbour of Carthagena. Admiral Matthews, on his arrival at Minorca, accused Lestock of having misbehaved on the day of action; suspended him from his office, and sent him prisoner to England, where, in his turn, he accused his accuser. Long before the engagement, these two o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icers had expressed the most virulent resentment against each other<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Matthews was brave, open, and undisguised; but proud, imperious, and pre∣cipitate. Lestock had signalized his courage on many occasions, and perfectly understood the whole discipline of the navy; but, he was cool, cunning and vindictive. He had been treated superciliously by Matthews, and in revenge took advantage of his errors and precipitation. To gratify this passion, he betrayed the interest and glory of his country; for, it is not to be doubted, but that he might have come up in time to engage; and in that case, the fleets of France and Spain would in all likelihood have been destroyed: but, he intrenched himself within the punctilios of discipline, and saw with pleasure his antagonist expose himself to the hazard of death, ruin, and disgrace. Matthews himself, in the sequel, sacrificed his duty to his resentment, in restraining Lestock from pursuing and attacking the combined squadrons on the third day after the engagement, when they appeared disabled and in manifest disorder, and would have fallen an easy prey, had they been vigorously attacked. One can hardly, without indignation, reflect upon those instances, in which a community has so severely suffered from the personal animosity of individuals. The miscarriage off Toulon became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry in England. The commons, in an address to the throne, desired that a court-martial might be ap∣pointed to try the delinquents. By this time Lestock had in his turn accused Matthews, and all the captains of his division who misbehaved in the day of battle. The court-martial was constituted, and proceeded to trial. Several commanders of ships were cashiered: vice-admiral Lestock was honourably acquitted, and admiral Matthews rendered incapable of serving for the future in his majesty's navy. All the world knew that Lestock kept aloof, and that Matthews rushed into the hottest part of the engagement. Yet, the former triumphed on his trial, and the latter narrowly escaped the sentence of death

for cowardice and misconduct. Such decisions are not to be accounted for, except from prejudice and faction.</P>

<P>The war in Germany, which had been almost extinguished in the last campaign, began to revive, and raged with redoubled violence. The emperor had solicited the mediation of his Britannic majesty for compromising the differen∣ces between him and the court of Vienna. Prince William of Hesse-Cassel had confered with the king of England on this subject; and a negotiation was begun at Hanau. The emperor offered to dismiss the French auxiliaries, provided the Austrians would evacuate his hereditary dominions. Nay, prince William and lord Carteret, as plenipotentiaries, actually agreed to preliminaries, by which his Imperial majesty engaged to renounce the alliance of France, and throw himself into the arms of the maritime powers; to resign all pretensions to the succession of the house of Austria; and to revive the vote of Bohemia in the electoral college; on condition of his being re-established in the possession of his dominions, and recogn zed as emperor by the queen of Hungary; and of his being accommo∣dated with a monthly subsidy for his maintainance, as his own territories were exhausted and impoverished by the war. By a separate article, the king or Great-Britain promised to furnish him with three hundred thousand crowns, and to interpose his good offices with the queen of Hungary, that his electoral dominions should be favourably treated. These preliminaries, though settled, were not signed. The court of Vienna was unwilling to part with their con∣quests in Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate. The queen trusted too much to the valour of her troops, and the wealth of her allies, to listen to such terms of accommodation; and whatever arguments were used with the king of Great-Britain, certain it is the negotiation was dropped, on pretence that the articles were disapproved by the ministry of England. The emperor, invironed with distress, renewed his application to the king of Great-Britain; and even declared that he would refer his cause to the determination of the maritime powers: but, all his advances were discountenanced; and the treaty of Worms dispelled all hope of accommodation. In this manner did the British ministry reject the fairest opportunity that could possibly occur, of terminating the war in Germany with honour and advantage, and of freeing their country from that insufferable burthen of expence under which she groaned.</P>

<P>The inflexibility of the house of Austria, and its chief ally, proved serviceable to the emperor. The forlorn situation of this unfortunate prince excited the compassion of divers princes: they resented the insolence with which the head of the empire had been treated by the court of Vienna; and they were alarmed at the increasing power of a family noted for pride, tyranny, and ambition. These considerations gave r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se to the treaty of Frankfort, concluded in May be∣tween the emperor, the king of Prussia, the king of Sweden as landgrave of Hesse Cassel, and the elector-palatine. They engaged to preserve the con∣stitutions of the empire, according to the treaty of Westphalia, and to sup∣port the emperor in his rank and dignity. They agreed to employ their good offices with the queen of Hungary, that she might be induced to acknowledge the emperor, to restore his hereditary dominions, and give up the archives of the empire that were in her possession. They guaranteed to each other their respective territories: the disputes about the succession of the late emperor they referred to the decision of the states of the empire: they promised to assist
<PB N="649" REF="6520"/>
one another in case of being attacked; and they invited the king of Poland, the elector of Cologne, and the bishop of Liege, to accede to this treaty. Such was the confederacy that broke all the measures which had been con∣certed between the king of Great-Btitain and her Hungarian majesty, for the operations of the campaign. In the mean time, the French king declared was against this princess, on pretence of her being obstinately deaf to all terms of accommodation, and determined to carry the war into the territories of France. In her counter-declaration she taxed him with having insringed the most solemn engagement with respect to the pragmatic sanction; with having spirited up different pretenders to lay claim to the succession of the late emperor; with having endeavoured to instigate the common enemy of Christendom against her; and with having acted the incendiary in the north of Europe, that the czarina might be prevented from assisting the house of Austria, while his nu∣merous armies overspread the empire, and desolated her hereditary countries. These recriminations were literally true. The houses of Bourbon and Austria have, for many centuries, been the common disturbers and plagues of Europe.</P>

<P>The king of France, though in himself pacific and unenterprising, was stimulated by his ministry to taste the glory of conquest in the Nether∣lands, where he had assembled an army of one hundred and twenty thousand men, provided with a very formidable train of artillery. The chief command was vested in the marechal count de Saxe, who possessed great military talents, and proved to be one of the most fortunate generals of the age in which he lived. The allied forces, consisting of English, Hanoverians, Dutch, and Aus∣trians, to the number of seventy thousand effective men, were in the month of May assembled in the neighbourhood of Brussels, from whence they marched towards Oudenarde, and posted themselves behind the Schelde, being unable to retard the progress of the enemy. The French monarch, attended by his favourite ladies, with all the pomp of eastern luxury, arrived at Lisle on the twelfth day of the same month; and in the adjacent plain reviewed his army. The states-general, alarmed at his preparations, had, in a conference with his ambassador at the Hague, expressed their apprehensions, and intreated his most christian majesty would desist from his design of attacking their barrier. Their remonstrances having proved ineffectual, they now sent a minister to wait upon that monarch, to enforce their former representations and repeat their intreaties: but no regard was payed to his request. The French king told him, he was determined to prosecute the war with vigour, as his moderation hitherto had served no other purpose but that of rendering his enemies more intractable. Accordingly his troops invested Menin, which was in seven days surrendered upon capitulation. Ypres, Fort Knocke, and Furnes, underwent the same fate; and, on the twenty-ninth day of June, the king of France entered Dun∣kirk in triumph.</P>

But all his measures were defeated by the skill and activity of prince Charles of Lorraine, who found means to pass the Rhine, and obliged the French and Bavarian generals to retire to Lampertheim, that they might cover

<P>In the mean time, the schemes of the Austrian general were frus∣trated by the king of Prussia, who, in the month of August, entered the electorate of Saxony, at the head of a numerous army. There he declared, in a public manifesto, that his aims were only to re-establish the peace of the empire, and to support the dignity of its head. He assured the inhabitants that they might depend upon his protection, in case they should remain quiet; but threatened them with fire and sword should they presume to oppose his arms. In a rescript addressed to his ministers at foreign courts, he accused the queen of Hungary of obstinacy, in refusing to acknowledge the emperor, and restore his hereditary dominions: he said he had engaged in the league of Franckfort, to hinder the head of the empire from being oppressed that he had no inten∣tion to violate the peace of Bre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>au, of enter as a principal into this war: he affirmed, that his design was to act as auxiliary to the emperor, and establish the quiet of Germany.

<P>During these transactions, count Seckendorf marching into Bava∣ria, at the head of a strong army, drove the Austrians out of that electorate, and the emperor regained possession of Munich, his capital, on the twenty-second day of October. In August the French army passed the Rhine at fort Louis, and invested the strong and important city of Fribourg, defended by general Damnitz, at the head of nine thousand veterans. The king of France arrived in the camp on the eleventh day of October; and the siege was carried on with uncommon vigour. The Austrian governor made incredible efforts in the defence of the place, which he maintained until it was reduced to a heap of ruins, and one half of the garrison destroyed. At length, however, they were obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war, after the trenches had been opened five and forty days, during which they had killed above fifteen thousand of the besiegers. With this conquest, the French king closed the campaign, and his army was cantoned along the Rhine, under the inspection of the count de Maillebois. By the detachments drawn from the French army in Flanders, count Saxe had found himself considerably weaker than the con∣federates: he threw up strong intrenchments behind the Lys, where he re∣mained on the defensive, until he was reinforced by the count de Clermont, who commanded a separate body on the side of Newport. The allies, to the number of seventy thousand, passed the Schelde, and advanced towards Helc∣hin; but the enemy being so advantageously posted, that they could not at∣tack him with any prospect of advantage, they filed on in sight of Tournay; and on the eighth day of August encamped in the plains of Lisle, in hope of drawing count Saxe from the situation in which he was so strongly fortified. Here they foraged for several days, and laid the open country under contribu∣tion; but they made no attempt upon the place itself, which in all probability would have fallen into their hands had they invested it at their first approach; for then there was no other garrison but two or three battalions of militia: but count Saxe soon threw in a considerable reinforcement. The allies were unprovided with a train of battering cannon; and their commanders would not deviate from the usual forms of war. Besides, they were divided in their opi∣nions, and despised one another. General Wade, who commanded the Eng∣lish and Hanover<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> was a vain, weak man, without confidence, weight, or authority; and the Austrian general, the duke d'Aremberg, was a proud, rapacious glutton, devoid of talents and sentiment. After having remained for some time in sight of Lisle, and made a general forage without molesta∣tion, they retired to their former camp on the Schelde, from whence they soon marched into winter-quarters. Count Saxe at length quitted his lines; and, by way of retaliation, sent out detachments to ravage the Low-Countries, to the very gates of Ghent and Bruges. The conduct of the allied generals was severely censured in England, and ridiculed in France, not only in private conversation but also on their public theatres, where it became the subject of farces and pantomimes.</P>

<HEAD>§ XV.</HEAD>
<P>The campaign in Italy produced divers vicissitudes of fortune. The king of Naples having assembled an army, joined count Gages, and published a manifesto in vindication of his conduct, which was a direct violation of the neutrality he had promised to observe. He maintained, that his moderation had been undervalued by the courts of London and Vienna; that his fron∣tiers
<PB N="652" REF="6550"/>
were threatened with the calamities of war; and that the queen of Hun∣gary made no secret of her intention to invade his dominions. This charge was not without foundation. The emissaries of the house of Austria endea∣voured to excite a rebellion in Naples, which prince Lobkowitz had orders to favour by an invasion. This general was encamped at Monte Rotundo, in the neighbourhood of Rome, when, in the month of June, the confederates ad∣vanced to Velletri. While the two armies remained in sight of each other, prince Lobkowitz detached a strong body of forces, under count Soro and general Gorani, who made an irruption into the province of Abruzzo, and took the city of Aquila, where they distributed a manifesto, in which the queen of Hungary exhorted the Neapolitans to shake off the Spanish yoke, and submit again to the house of Austria. This step, however, produced little or no effect; and the Austrian detachment retired at the approach of the duke of Vieuville, with a superior number of forces. In August, count Brown, at the head of an Austrian detachment, surprised Velletri in the night; and the king of the two Sicilies, with the duke of Modena, were in the utmost danger of being taken. They escaped by a postern with great difficulty, and repaired to the quarters of count Gages, who performed the part of a great general on this occasion. He rallied the fugitives, dispelled the pannic and confusion which had begun to prevail in his camp, and made a disposition for cutting off the retreat of the Austrians. Count Brown, finding himself in danger of being surrounded, thought proper to secure his retreat, which he effected with great art and gallantry, carrying off a prodigious booty. Three thousand Spaniards are said to have fallen in this action; and eight hundred men were taken, with some standards and colours. Count Mariani, a Neapolitan ge∣neral, was among the prisoners. The Austrians lost about six hundred men; and general Novati fell into the hands of the enemy: but the exploit produced no consequence of importance. The heats of autumn proved so fatal to the Austrians, who were not accustomed to the climate, that prince Lobkowitz saw his army mouldering away, without any possibility of its being recruited: besides, the country was so drained, that he could no longer procure sub∣sistence. Impelled by these considerations, he meditated a retreat. On the eleventh day of November, he decamped from Faiola, marched under the walls of Rome, passed the Tyber at Ponte Molle, formerly known by the name of the Pons Milvius, which he had just time to break down behind him, when the vanguard of the Spaniards and Neapolitans appeared. Part of his rear∣guard, however, was taken, with count Soro who commanded it, at Nocera; and his army suffered greatly by desertion. Nevertheless, he continued his retreat with equal skill and expedition, passed the mountains of Gubio, and by the way of Viterbo reached the Bolognese. The pope was altogether passive. In the beginning <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the campaign, he had caressed Lobkowitz; and now he received the king of the two Sicilies with marks of the warmest affection. That <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> having visited the chief curiosities of Rome, returned to Naples, leaving part of his troops under the command of count Gages.</P>

<PB N="653" REF="6560"/>
the city of Nice, without opposition. In April, they attacked the king of Sar∣dinia, who, with twenty thousand men, was strongly intrenched among the mountains at Villa Franca. The action was obstinate and bloody; but their numbers and perseverance prevailed. He was obliged to abandon his posts, and embark on board of the British squadron, which transported him and his troops to Vado. The intention of Don Philip was to penetrare through the territories of Genoa into the Milanese; but admiral Matthews, who hovered with a strong squadron on that coast, sent a message to the republic, declaring, that should the combined army be suffered to pass through her dominions, the king of Great-Britain would consider such a step as a breach of their neutrality. The senate, intimidated by this intimation, intreated the princes to desist from their design; and they resolved to chuse another route. They defiled towards Piedmont, and assaulted the strong post of Chateau-Dauphine, defended by the king of Sardinia in person. After a desperate attack, in which they lost four thousand men, the place was taken; the garrison of Demont sur∣rendered at discretion, and the whole country of Piedmont was laid under con∣tribution. His Sardinian majesty was not in a condition to hazard a battle; and therefore posted himself at Saluzzes, in order to cover his capital. The combined army advanced to the strong and important town of Coni, which was invested in the beginning of September. Baron Leutrum the governor made an obstinate defence, and the situation of the place was such as rendered the siege difficult, tedious, and bloody. The king of Sardinia being reinforced by ten thousand Austrians, under general Pallavicini, advanced to its relief, and a battle ensued. The action was maintained with great vigour on both sides, till night, when his majesty finding it impracticable to force the enemy's in∣trenchments, retired in good order to his camp at Murasso. He afterwards found means to throw a reinforcement and supply of provisions into Coni; and the heavy rains that fell at this period, not only retarded, but even dispirited the besiegers. Nevertheless, the princes persisted in their design, notwithstanding a dea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th of provisions, and the approach of winter, till the latter end of No∣vember, when the chevalier de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o entered the place with six hundred fresh men.

Having dismantled the fortifications of this place, they retreated with great precipitation to Dauphinė, and were dreadfully harrassed by the Vaudois and light troops in the service of his Sar∣dinian majesty, who now again saw himself in possession of Piedmont. The French troops were quartered in Dauphine: but Don Philip still maintained his footing in Savoy, the inhabitants of which he fleeced without mercy.</P>

<PB N="654" REF="6570"/>
A frigate, commanded by captain Cheap, was shipwrecked on a desolate island in the South-Sea. Mr. Anson having undergone a dreadful tempest, which dispersed his fleet, arrived at the island of Juan Fernandez, where he was joined by the Gloucester a ship of the line, a sloop and a pink loaded with provisions. These were the remains of his squadron. He made prize of several vessels; took and burned the little town of P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yta, set fail from the coast of Mexico, for the Philippine isles; and in this passage the Gloucester was abandoned and sunk: the other vessels had been destroyed, for want of men to navigate them, so that nothing now rem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ned out the commodore's own ship the Centurion, and that but very indifferently manned; for, the crews had been horribly thinned by sickness. Incredible were the hardships and misery they sustained from the shattered condition of the ships, and the scorbutic disorder, when they reached the plentiful island of Tinian, where they were supplied with the necessary refreshments. Thence they prosecured their voyage to the river of Can∣ton in China, where the commodore ordered the ship to be sheathed, and found means to procure a reinforcement of sailors. The chief object of his attention was the rich annual ship that sails <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in Mexico, and Manila out of the Philippine islands. In <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> intercepting her, he set sail from Canton, and steered his course back to the straights of Manilla, where she actually fell into his hands, after a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ort but vigorous engagement. The prize was called Neustra Signora de Cabalong<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, mounted with forty guns, manned with six hundred sailors, and loaded with treasure and effects to the value of three hundred and thirteen thousand pounds sterling: with this windfall, he returned to Canton; from whence he proceeded to the Cape of Good-Hope, and prosecuted his voyage to England, where he arrived in safety. Though this fortunate commander enriched himself by an occurrence that may be termed almost accidental, the British nation was not indemnified for the expence of the expedition, and the original design was intirely defeated. Had the Manilla ship escaped the vigilance of the English commodore, he might have been, at his return to England, laid aside as a superannuated cap∣tain, and died in obscurity: but, his great wealth invested him with consider∣able influence, and added lustre to his talents. He soon became the oracle which was consulted in all naval deliberations; and the king raised him to the dignity of a peerage. In July, Sir John Balchen, an admiral of approved valcur and great experience, failed from Spithead with a strong squadron, in quest of an opportunity to attack the French fleet at Brest, under the com∣mand of M. de Rochambault. In the bay of Biscay he was overtaken by a violent storm that dispersed the ships, and drove them up the English channel. Admiral Stewart, with the greater part of them, arrived at Plymouth; but Sir John Balchen's own ship the Victory, which was counted the most beautiful first rate in the world, foundered at sea; and this brave commander perished with all his officers, volunteers, and crew, amounting to eleven hundred choice seamen.

<P>The dissentions in the British cabinet were now ripened into another revolution in the ministry. Lord Carteret, who was by this time earl of Gran∣ville, in consequence of his mother's death, had engrossed the royal favour so much, that the duke of N—and his brother are said to have taken um∣brage at his influence and greatness. He had incurred the resentment of those who were distinguished by the appellation of Patriots, and intirely forfeited his popularity. The two brothers were very powerful by their parliamentary inte∣rest: they knew their own strength, and engaged in a political alliance with the leading men in the opposition, against the prime-minister and his measures. This coalition was dignified with the epithet of "The Broad Bottom," as if it had been established on a true constitutional foundation, comprehending indi∣viduals of every class, without distinction of party. The appellation, however, which they assumed, was afterwards converted into a term of derision. The earl of G—perceiving the gathering storm, and foreseeing the impossibility of withstanding such an opposition in parliament, wisely avoided the impending danger and disgrace, by a voluntary resignation of his employments. The earl of Harrington succeeded him as secretary of state. The duke of Bedford was appointed first lord of the admiralty, and the earl of Chesterfield declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The lords Gower and Cobham were re established in the offices they had resigned: Mr. Littleton was admitted as a commissioner of the treasury; even Sir John Hynd-Cotton accepted of a place at court; and Sir John Phillips sat at the board of trade and plantations, though he soon renounced this employment. This was rather a change of men than of mea∣sures, and turned out to the ease and advantage of the sovereign; for, his views were no longer thwarted by an obstinate opposition in parliament. The session was opened on the twenty-eighth day of November, in the usual manner; and the commons unanimously granted about six millions and an half for the ser∣vice of the ensuing year, to be raised by the land, the malt, and the salt-taxes, the sinking-fund, and an additional duty on wines. In January, the earl of Chesterfield set out for the Plague, with the character of ambassador-extraordi∣nary, to persuade, if possible, the states-general to engage heartily in the war. About the same time, a treaty of quadruple alliance was signed at Warsaw, by the queen of Hungary, the king of Poland, and the maritime powers. This was a mutual guaranty of the dominions belonging to the contracting parties; but, his Polish majesty was paid for his concurrence, with an annual subsidy of one hundred and fifty thousand pounds, two thirds of which were defrayed by England, and the remainder was disbursed by the United-Provinces <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Robert earl of Oxford, late prime minister, died in March, after having for a very short time enjoyed a pension of four thousand pounds granted by the crown, in consideration of his past servi∣ces.

The young elector was obliged to aban∣don his capital, and retire to Augsburgh, where he found himself in danger of losing all his dominions. In this emergency, he yielded to the earnest solicita∣tions of the empress his mother, inforced by the advice of his uncle the elector of Cologne, and of his general count Seckendorff, who exhorted him to be reconciled to the court of Vienna. A negotiation was immediately begun at Fue<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sen, where in April the treaty was concluded. The queen consented to recognize the imperial dignity, as having been vested in the person of his fa∣ther; to acknowledge his mother as empress dowager; to restore his dominions, with all the fortresses, artillery, stores, and ammunition, which she had taken: on the other hand, he renounced all claim to the succession of her father, and became guarantee of the pragmatic sanction. He acknowledged the validity of the electoral vote of Bohemia in the person of the queen; and engaged to give his vote for the grand duke, at the ensuing election of a king of the Ro∣mans. Until that should be determined, both parties agreed that Ingoldstadt should be garrisoned by neutral troops; and that Braunau and Schardingen, with all the country lying between the Inn and the Saltza, should remain in the queen's possession, though without prejudice to the civil government, or the elector's revenue. In the mean time he dismissed the auxiliaries that were in his pay, and they were permitted to retire without molestation.</P>

<P>The court of Vienna had now secured the votes of all the electors, except those of Brandenburgh and the Palatinate. Nevertheless, France assembled a powerful army in the neighbourhood of Franckfort, in order to influence the election. But the Austrian army<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> commanded by the grand duke in person, marched thither from the Danube; and the prince of Conti was obliged to repass the Rhine at Nordlingen. Then the great duke repaired to Franckfort, where, on the second day of September he was by a majority of voices declared king of the Romans, and emperor of Germany. Mean while<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the king of Prussia had made great progress in the conquest of Silesia. The campaign began in January, when the Hungarian insurgents were obliged to retire into Moravia. In the following month the Prussian general Lehwald defeated a body of twelve thousand Austrians, commanded by general Helsrich: the town of Ratibor was taken by assault; and the king entered Silesia in May, at the head of seventy thousand men. Prince Charles of Lorraine being joined by the duke of Saxe-Weissenfels and twenty thousand Saxons, penetrated into S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lesia by the defiles of Landshut; and were attacked by his Prussian majesty
<PB N="657" REF="6600"/>
in the plains of Strigan, near Friedbergh. The battle was maintained from morning till noon, when the Saxons giving way, prince Charles was obliged to retire with the loss of twelve thousand men, and a great number of colours, standards, and artillery. This victory, obtained on the fourth day of June, complete as it was, did not prove decisive; for, though the victor transferred the seat of the war into Bohemia, and maintained his army by raising contributions in that country, the Austrians resolved to hazard another engagement. Their aim was to surprise him in his camp at Sohr, which they attacked on the thirtieth of September, at day-break; but they met with such a warm reception, that notwithstanding their repeated efforts during the space of four hours, they were repulsed with considerable damage; and retreated to Jaromire, leaving five thousand killed upon the spot, besides two thousand that were taken, with many standards and twenty pieces of cannon. The loss of this battle was in a great measure owing to the avarice of the irregulars, who having penetrated into the Prussian camp, began to pillage with great eagerness, giving the king an op∣portunity to rally his disordered troops, and restore the battle: nevertheless, they retired with the plunder of his baggage, including his military chest, the officers of his chancery, his-own secretary, and all the papers of his cabinet.</P>

<P>After this action his Prussian majesty returned to Berlin; and breathed nothing but peace and moderation. In August he had signed a con∣vention with the king of Great-Britain, who became guarantee of his possessions in Silesia, as yielded by the treaty of Breslau; and he promised to vote for the grand duke of Tuscany at the election of an emperor. This was intended as the basis of a more general accommodation. But, he now pretended to have received undoubted intelligence, that the king of Poland and the queen of Hungary had agreed to invade Brandenburgh with three different armies; and, that for this purpose his Polish majesty had demanded of the czarina the suc∣cours stipulated by treaty between the two crowns. Alarmed, or seemingly alarmed at this information, he sollicited the maritime powers to fulfil their engagements; and interpose their good offices with the court of Petersburgh. Yet, far from waiting for the result of these remonstrances, he made a sudden irruption into Lusatia, took possession of Gorlitz, and obliged prince Charles of Lorraine to retire before him into Bohemia. Then he entered Leipsick, and layed Saxony under contribution. The king of Poland, unable to resist the torrent, quitted his capital and took refuge in Prague. His troops, reinforced by a body of Austrians, were defeated at Pirna on the fifteenth day of December; and his Prussian majesty became master of Dr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sden without further opposition. The king of Poland, thus deprived of his hereditary dominions, was fain to acquiesce in such terms as the conqueror thought proper to impose; and the treaty of Dresden was concluded under the mediation of his Britannic majesty. By this convention the king of Prussia retained all the contributions he had levied in Saxony; and was intitled to a million of German crowns, to be payed by his Polish majesty at the next fair of Leipsick. He and the elector Palatine con∣sented to acknowledge the grand duke as emperor of Germany; and this last confirmed to his Prussian majesty certain privileges de non evocando, which had been granted by the late emperor, with regard to some territories possessed by the king of Prussia, though not belonging to the electorate of Brandenburgh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<P>Though the French king could not prevent the elevation of the grand duke to the Imperial throne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he resolved to humble the house of Austria, by making a conquest of the Netherlands. A prodigious army was there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssembled, under the au<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pices of mar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>chal count de Saxe; and his most christian <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aj<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ty, with the dauph<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, arriving in the camp, they invested the strong town of Tournay on the thirtieth day of April. The Dutch garrison consisted of e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thousand men, commanded by the old baron Dorth, who made a vigorous defence. The duke of Cumberland assumed the chief command of the allied army assembled at Soignies; and he was assisted with the advice of the count Kon<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gseg, an Austrian general, and the prince of Waldeck, commander of the Dutch forces. Their army was greatly inferior in number to that of the enemy; nevertheless, they resolved to march <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the relief of Tournay. They accordingly advanced to Le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and on the twenty-eighth day of April took post at Maulbre, in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight of the French army, which was encamped on an eminence from the village of Antoine to a large wood beyond Vezon, having Fontenoy in their front. Next day was employed by the allies in driving the enemy from some outposts, and clearing the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iles through which they were obliged to advance to the attack; while the French completed their batteries, and made the most formidable preparations for their reception. On the thirtieth day of April the duke of Cumberland having made the proper dispositions, began his march to the enemy at two o'clock in the morning: a brisk cannonade en∣sued; and about nine both armies were engaged. The British infantry drove the French beyond their lines; but, the left wing failing in the attack on the village of Fontenoy, and the cavalry forbearing to advance on the flanks, they measured back their ground with some disorder, from the prodigious <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire of the French batteries. They rallied, however, and returning to the charge with redou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdour, repulsed the enemy to their camp with great slaughter; but, being wholly unsupported by the other wing, and exposed both in front and flank to a dreadful fire which did great execution, the duke was obliged to make the necessary dispositions for a retreat about three o'clock in the afternoon; and this was effected in tolerable order. The battle was fought with great obstinacy, and the carnage on both sides was very considerable. The allies lost about twelve thousand men, including a good number of officers; and among these lieute∣nant-general Campbel, and major-general Ponsonby. The victory cost the French almost an equal number of lives; and although the attack was gene∣rally judged rash and precipitate, the British and Hanoverian troops fought with such intrepid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty and perseverance, that if they had been properly sustained by t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tch forces, and their flanks covered by the cavalry, the French, in all likelihood, would have been obliged to abandon their enterprize. The duke of Cumberland left his s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck and wounded to the humanity of the victors; and retiring to Aeth, encamped in an advantageous situation at Lessines. The garrison of Tournay, though now deprived of all hope of succour, maintained the place to the twenty-first day of June, when the governor obtained an honourable capitulation. After the conquest of Tournay, which was dismantled, the duke of Cumberland apprehending the enemy had a design upon Ghent,
<PB N="659" REF="6620"/>
sent a detachment of four thousand men to reinforce the garrison of that city<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but, they fell into an ambuscade at Pas-du-mêle; and were killed or taken, except a few dragoons that escaped to Ostend: on that very night, which was the twelfth of June, Ghent was surprised by a detachment of the French army. Then they invested Ostend, which, though defended by an English garrison, and open to the sea, was after a short siege surrendered by capitulation on the four∣teenth day of August. Dendermonde, Oudenarde, Newport, and Aeth, underwent the same fate; while the allied army lay intrenched beyond the canal of Antwerp: and the French king having subdued the greatest part of the Austrian Netherlands, returned to Paris, which he entered in triumph.</P>

<P>The campaign in Italy was unpropitious to the queen of Hungary and the king of Sardinia. Count Gages passed the Appenines, and entered the state of Lucca; from thence he proceeded by the eastern coast of Genoa to Lestride-Levante. The junction of the two armies was thus accomplished, and reinforced with ten thousand Genoese: mean while prince Lobkowitz decamped from Modena, and took post at Parma; but, he was soon succeeded by count Schuylemberg, and sent to command the Austrians in Bohemia. The Spaniards entered the Milanese without further opposition. Count Gages with thirty thousand men took possession of Serravalle; and advancing towards Placentia, obliged the Austrians to retire under the cannon of Tortona: but, when Don Philip, at the head of forty thousand troops, made himself master of Acqui, the king of Sardinia and the Austrian general, unable to stem the torrent, retreated behind the Tanaro. The strong citadel of Tortona was taken by the Spaniards, who likewise reduced Parma and Placentia; and forcing the passage of the Tanaro, compelled his Sardinian majesty to take shelter on the other side of the Po. Then Pavia was won by scalade; and the city of Milan submitted to the infant, though the Austrian garrison still maintained the citadel: all Piedmont, on both sides of the Po, as far as Turin, was reduced, and even that capital threatened with a siege: so that by the month of October the terri∣tories belonging to the house of Austria, in Italy, were wholly subdued; and the king of Sardinia stripped of all his dominions: yet he continued firm and true to his engagements, and deaf to all proposals of a separate accommodation.</P>

<P>The naval transactions of Great-Britain were in the course of this year remarkably spirited. In the Mediterranean, admiral Rowley had succeeded Matthews in the command; and Savona, Genoa, Final, St. Remo, with Bastia the capital of Corsica, were bombarded: several Spanish ships were taken; but he could not prevent the safe arrival of their rich Havannah squadron at Corunna. Commodore Barnet in the East-Indies made prize of several French ships richly laden; and commodore Townshend, in the latitude of Martinico, took about thirty merchant ships belonging to the enemy, under convoy of four ships of war, two of which were destroyed. The English privateers likewise met with uncommon success. But the most important atchievement was the conquest of Louisburgh on the isle of Cape-Breton, in North-America; a place of great consequence, which the French had fortified at a prodigious expence. The scheme of reducing this fortress was planned in Boston, recommended by their general assembly, and approved by his majesty, who sent instructions to com∣modore Warren, stationed off the Leeward-Islands, to sail for the northern parts of America, and co-operate with the forces of New-England in this expedition.
<PB N="660" REF="6630"/>
A body of six thousand men was formed under the conduct of Mr. Pepperel, a trader of Piseataway, whose influence was extensive in that country; though he was a man of little or no education, and utterly unacquainted with military operations. In April Mr. Warren arrived at Canso with ten ships of war; and the troops of New-England being embarked in transports, sailed immediately for the isle of Cape-Breton, where they landed without opposition. The enemy abandoned their grand battery, which was detached from the town; and the immediate seizure of it contributed in a good measure to the success of the enterprize. While the American troops, reinforced by eight hundred marines, carried on their approaches by land, the squadron blocked up the place by sea in such a manner, that no succours could be introduced. A French ship of the line, with some smaller vessels destined for the relief of the garrison, were inter∣cepted and taken by the British cruisers; and indeed, the reduction of Louisburgh was chiefly owing to the vigilance and activity of Mr. Warren, one of the bravest and best officers in the service of England. The operations of the siege were wholly conducted by the engineers and officers who commanded the British marines; and the Americans being ignorant of war, were contented to act under their directions. The town being considerably damaged by the bombs and bullets of the besiegers, and the governor despairing of relief, capitulated on the seventeenth day of June, when the city of Louisburgh, and the isle of Cape-Breton, were surrendered to his Britannic majesty. The garrison and inhabitants engaged, that they would not bear arms for twelve months against Great-Britain or her allies; and being embarked in fourteen cartel ships, were trans∣ported to Rochfort. In a few days after the surrender of Louisburgh, two French East-India ships, and another from Peru laden with treasure, failed into the harbour, on the supposition that it still belonged to France; and were taken by the English squadron.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>The news of this conquest being transmitted to England, Mr. Pep∣perel was preferred to the dignity of a knight-baronet; and congratulatory addresses were presented to the king on the success of his majesty's arms. The possession of Cape-Breton was, doubtless, a valuable acquisition to Great-Britain. It not only distressed the French in their fishery and navigation, but removed all fears of encroachment and rivalship from the English fishers on the banks of Newfoundland. It freed New-England from the terrors of a dangerous neighbour; overawed the Indians of that country; and secured the possession of Acadia to the crown of Great-Britain. The plan of this conquest was originally layed by Mr. Auchmury, judge-advocate of the court of admiralty in New-England. He demonstrated, that the reduction of Cape-Breton would put the English in sole possession of the fishery of North-America, which would annually return to Great-Britain two millions sterling for the manufactures yearly shipped to the plantations; employ many thousand families that were otherwise unser∣viceable to the public; increase the shipping and mariners; extend navigation; out off all communication between France and Canada by the river St. Laurence; so that Quebec would fall of course into the hands of the English, who might expel the French entirely from America, open a correspondence with the re∣mote Indians, and render themselves masters of the profitable fur trade, which was now engrossed by the enemy. The natives of New-England acquired great glory from the success of this enterprize. Britain, which had in some
<PB N="661" REF="6640"/>
instances behaved like a stepmother to her own colonies, was now convinced of their importance; and treated those as brethren whom she had too long con∣sidered as aliens and rivals. Circumstanced as the nation is, the legislature cannot too tenderly cherish the interests of the British plantations in America. They are inhabited by a brave, hardy, industrious people, animated with an active spirit of commerce; inspired with a noble zeal for liberty and independence. The trade of Great-Britain, clogged with heavy taxes and impositions, has for some time languished in many valuable branches. The French have undersold our cloths, and spoiled our markets in the Levant. Spain is no longer supplied as usual with the commodities of England: the exports to Germany must be considerably diminished, by the misunderstanding between Great-Britain and the house of Austria; consequently her greatest resource must be in her communi∣cation with her own colonies, which consume her manufactures, and make immense returns in sugar, rum, tobacco, fish, timber, naval stores, iron, furs, drugs, rice, and indigo. The southern plantations likewise produce silk; and with due encouragement might furnish every thing that could be expected from the most fertile soil and the happiest climate. The continent of North-America, if properly cultivated, will prove an inexhaustible fund of wealth and strength to Great-Britain; and perhaps it may become the last asylum of British liberty, when the nation is enslaved by domestic despotism or foreign dominion; when her substance is wasted, her spirit broke, and the laws and constitution of England are no more: then those colonies sent off by our fathers may receive and entertain their sons as hapless exiles and ruined refugees.</P>

<P>While the continent of Europe and the isles of America were thus exposed to the ravages of war, and subjected to such vicissitudes of fortune, Great-Britain underwent a dangerous convulsion in her own bowels. The son of the chevalier de St. George, fired with ambition, and animated with the hope of ascending the throne of his ancestors, resolved to make an effort for that purpose, which, though it might not be crowned with success, should at least astonish all Christendom. Whether he was invited and encouraged by the sollicitations and promises of those in Great-Britain, who wished well to his father's house, or chiefly depended upon the assistance of the French monarch; or was induced by these concurring motives, we shall not pretend to determine; but, if we judge from appearances, he seems to have projected a revolution on the strength of his own personal interest and qualifications. He knew, indeed, the principles and characters of those individuals who adhered to the Stuart family; because they had always in secret maintained a correspondence with his father: and, in all probability, he was cajoled by the sanguine misrepresentations of a few adventurers who hoped to profit by the expedition. They assured him, that the whole nation was disaffected to the reigning family: that the people could no longer bear the immense load of taxes, which was daily increasing; and, that the most considerable persons of the kingdom would gladly seize the first opportunity of crouding to his standard. He was at the same time regaled with the promise of powerful succours from France, though the ministry of that kingdom were never hearty in his cause: nevertheless they foresaw, that his ap∣pearance in England would embarrass the government, and make a considerable diversion in their favour. Certain it is, that if he had been properly supported, he could not have found a more favourable opportunity of exciting an intestine
<PB N="662" REF="6650"/>
commotion in Great-Britain; for Scotland was quite unfurnished with troops, king George was in Germany, and great part of the Highlanders were keen for insurrection. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eir natural principles were on this occasion stimulated by the suggestions of revenge. At the beginning of the war a regiment of those people had been formed, and transported with the rest of the British troops to Flanders. Before they were embarked, a number of them deserted with their arms, on pretence, that they had been decoyed into the service, by promises and assurances that they should never be sent abroad; and this was really the case. They were overtaken by a body of horse, persuaded to submit, brought back to London p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nioned like malefactors, and tried for desertion. Three were shot to death i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> terrorem; and the rest were sent in exile to the plantations. Those who suffered were persons of some consequence in their own country; and their fate was deeply re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by the clans to which they belonged. It was considered as a national outrage; and the Highlanders, who are naturally vindictive, waited impatiently for an opportunity of vengeance.</P>

<P>The young pretender being furnished with a sum of money, and a supply of arms by the ministry of France, embarked on board of a small frigate at port St. Lazare, accompanied by the marquis of Tullibardine, Sir Thomas Sheridan, with a few other Irish and Scottish adventurers; and setting sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l on the fourteenth of July, was off Belleisle joined by the Elizabeth, a French ship of war mounted with sixty-six guns, as his convoy. Their design was to sail round Ireland, and land in the western part of Scotland; but falling in with the Lion, an English ship of the line, a very obstinate and bloody action ensued. The Elizabeth was so disabled that she could not prosecute the voyage, and with difficulty reached the harbour of Brest; but the Lion was shattered to such a degree, that she floated like a wreck upon the water. Prince Charles in the frigate continued his course to the western isles of Scotland; and landing on the coast of Lochaber, was in a little time joined by a considerable number of hardy mountainers, under their respective chiefs or leaders. Some of those, however, on whom he principally depended, now stood aloof, either fluctuating in their principles, astonished at the boldness of the undertaking, or startled at the remonstrances of their friends, who did not fail to represent in aggravated colours, all the danger of embarking in such a desperate enterprize. Had the government acted with proper vigour when they received intelligence of his arrival, the adventure must have been crushed in embrio before any considera∣ble number of his adherents could have been brought together; but, the lords of the regency seemed to slight the information, and even to suspect the integrity of those by whom it was conveyed. They were soon convinced of their mistake. Prince Charles, having assembled about fifteen hundred men, encamped in the neighbourhood of Fort William; and immediately hostilities were commenced. A detachment from his main body surprised two companies of new-raised soldiers, who, with their officer, were disarmed after an obstinate dispute; another captain of the king<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s forces falling into their hands, was courteously dismissed with one of the pretender's manifestos, and a passport for his personal safety. The administration was now effectually alarmed. The lords of the regency issued a proclamation, offering a reward of thirty thousand pounds to any person who should apprehend the prince-adventurer; and a courier was dispatched to Hol∣land to hasten the return of his majesty, who arrived in England about the
<PB N="663" REF="6660"/>
latter end of August. A requisition was made of the six thousand Dutch auxiliaries; and several British regiments were recalled from the Netherlands. A loyal address was presented to the king by the city of London; and the merchants of this metropolis resolved to raise two regiments at their own expence. Orders were issued to keep the trained bands in readiness; to array the militia of West∣minster; and instructions to the same effect were sent to all the lords<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lieutenants of the counties throughout the kingdom. The principal noblemen of the nation made a tender of their services to their sovereign; and some of them re∣ceived commissions to levy regiments towards the suppression of the rebellion. Bodies of volunteers were incorporated in London, and many other places; associations formed, large contributions raised in different towns, counties, and communities; and a great number of eminent merchants in London agreed to support the public credit, by receiving, as usual, bank<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>notes in payment, for the purposes of traffic. The protestant clergy of all denominations exerted themselves with extraordinary ardour, in preaching against the religion of Rome and the pretender; and the friends of the government were encouraged, ani∣mated, and con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irmed in their principles, by several spirited productions published for the occasion.</P>

<P>In a word, the whole nation seemed unanimously bent upon opposing the enterprize of the pretender, who, nevertheless, had already made surprising progress. His arrival in Scotland was no sooner confirmed, than Sir John Cope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> who commanded the troops in that kingdom, assembled what force he could bring together, and advanced against the rebels. Understanding, however, that they had taken possession of a strong pass, he changed his route, and proceeded northwards as far as Inverness, leaving the capital and the southern parts of North-Britain wholly exposed to the incursions of the enemy. They forthwith marched to Perth, where the chevalier de St. George was pro∣claimed king of Great-Britain, and the public money seized for his use: the same steps were taken at Dundee, and other places. Here prince Charles was joined by the nobleman who assumed the title of duke of Perth, the vis∣count Strathallan, lord Nairn, lord George Murray, and many persons of distinction, with their followers. The marquis of Tullibardine, who had ac∣companied him from France, took possession of Athol, as heir of blood to the titles and estate which his younger brother enjoyed in consequence of his at∣tainder; and met with some success in arming the tenants for the support of that cause which he avowed. The rebel army being considerably augmented, though very ill provided with arms, crossed the Forth in the neighbourhood of Stirling, and advanced towards Edinburgh, which they entered without oppo∣sition. The inhabitants were divided by faction and distracted by fear: the place was not in a posture of defence, and the magistrates would not expose the people to the uncertain issue of an assault. In September, the rebels were ad∣mitted into the city; and their prince took possession of the royal palace of Holy∣rood house, in the suburbs. Then he caused his father to be proclaimed at the market-cross; and there also the manifesto was read, in which the chevalier de St. George declared his son Charles regent of his dominions, promised to dissolve the union, and redress the grievances of Scotland. His being in possession of the capital encouraged his followers, and added reputation to his arms: but he missed his aim of seizing the treasure belonging to the two banks of that kingdom, which had been previously conveyed into the castle, a strong

fortress, with a good garrison under the command of general Guest, an officer of experience and capacity.</P>

<P>During these transactions, Sir John Cope marched back from Inverness to Aberdeen, where he embarked with his troops, and on the six∣teenth day of September landed at Dunbar, about twenty miles to the eastward of Edinburgh. Here he was joined by two regiments of dragoons, which had retired from the capital at the approach of the Highland army With this reinforcement, his troops amounted to three thousand men, including some Highlanders well-affected to the government, who had offered their services to him at Inverness; and he began his march for Edinburgh, in order to give battle to the enemy. On the twentieth day of the month, he encamped in the neighbourhood of Preston-pans, having the village of Tranent in his front, and the sea in his rear. Early next morning he was attacked by the young pre∣tender, at the head of about three thousand Highlanders half armed, who charged him sword in hand, with such impetuosity, that in less than ten minutes after the battle began, the king's troops were broken and totally routed. The dragoons fled with great precipitation at the first onset: the general officers having made some unsuccessful efforts to rally them, thought proper to con∣sult their own safety by an expeditious retreat towards Berwick. All the infantry was either killed or taken; and the colours, artillery, tents, bag∣gage, and military chest, fell into the hands of the victor, who returned in triumph to Edinburgh. Never was victory more complete, or obtained at a smaller expence; for not above fourscore of the rebels lost their lives in the engagement. Five hundred of the king's troops were killed on the field of battle; and among these colonel Gardiner, a gallant officer, who disdained to save his life at the expence of his honour. When abandoned by his own re∣giment of dragoons, he alighted from his horse, joined the infantry, and fought on foot, until he fell covered with wounds, in sight of his own threshold. Prince Charles bore his good fortune with moderation. The wounded soldiers were treated with humanity; and the officers were sent into Fife and Angus, where they were left at liberty on their parole, which the greater part of them shame∣fully broke in the sequel. From this victory the pretender reaped manifold and important advantages. His followers were armed, his party encouraged, and his enemies intimidated. He was supplied with a train of field-artillery, and a considerable sum of money, and saw himself possessed of all Scotland, except the fortresses, the reduction of which he could not pretend to undertake with∣out proper implements and engineers. After the battle he was joined by a small detachment from the Highlands; and some chiefs, who had hitherto been on the reserve, began to exert their influence in his favour. But he was not yet in a condition to take advantage of that consternation which his late success had diffused through the kingdom of England.</P>

<P>He continued to reside in the palace of Holy-rood house; and made some unsuccessful attempts to cut off the communication between the castle and the city. He levied a regiment in Edinburgh and the neighbour∣hood. He imposed taxes; seized the merchandise that was deposited in the king's warehouses at Leith, and other places; compelled the city of Glasgow to accommodate him with a large sum, and layed the country under contri∣bution. The number of his followers daily increased; and he received con∣siderable
<PB N="665" REF="6680"/>
supplies of money, artillery, and ammunition, by single ships that arrived from France, where his interest seemed to rise in proportion of the suc∣cess of his arms. The greater and richer part of Scotland was averse to his family and pretensions: but the people were unarmed and undisciplined, consequently passive under his dominion. Several powerful chiefs in the Highlands were attached to the government, and exerted themselves in its defence. The duke of Argyle began to arm his vassals: twelve hundred men were raised by the earl of Sutherland: the lord Rae brought a considerable number to the field: the Grants and Monroes appeared under their respective leaders for the service of his majesty: Sir Alexander Macdonald and the laird of Macleod sent two thousand hardy Islanders from Skie, to strengthen the same interest. These gentlemen were governed and directed by the advice of Dun∣can Forbes, president of the college of justice at Edinburgh, a man of ex∣tensive knowledge, agreeable manners, and unblemished integrity. He acted with indefatigable zeal for the interest of the reigning family; and even ex∣hausted an opulent fortune in their service. He confirmed several chiefs who began to waver in their principles: some he actually converted by the energy of his arguments, and brought over to the assistance of the government, which they had determined to oppose: others he persuaded to remain quiet, without taking any share in the present troubles. The earl of Loudon re∣paired to Inverness, where he completed his regiment of Highlanders; directed the conduct of the clans who had taken arms in behalf of his majesty; and, by his vigilance, overawed the disaffected chieftains of that country who had not yet openly engaged in the rebellion. By this time, however, the prince-pretender was joined by the earl of Kilmarnock, the lords Elcho, Balmerino, Ogilvy, Pitsligo; and the eldest son of lord Lovat had begun to assemble his father's clan, in order to reinforce the victorious adventurer, whose army lay encamped by Dalkeith, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Kilmarnock, Pitsligo, and Balmerino, were men of broken and desperate fortune: Elcho and Ogilvie were sons to the earls of Wemys and Airly; so that their influence was far from being extensive. But great dependance was placed upon the power and attachment of lord Lovat, who had entered into private engage∣ments with the chevalier de St. George; though he still wore the mask of loyalty to the government, and disavowed the conduct of his son when he de∣clared for the pretender. This old nobleman is the same Simon Frazer whom we have had occasion to mention as a partisan and emissary of the court of St. Germains, in the year one thousand seven hundred and eight. He had re∣nounced his connections with that family; and, in the rebellion immediately after the accession of king George I. approved himself a warm friend to the protestant succession. Since that period he had been induced, either by disgust or ambition, to change his principles again, and was in secret an enthusiast in jacobitism. He had greatly augmented his estate, and obtained a considerable interest in the Highlands, where, however, he was rather dreaded than be∣loved. He was bold, enterprising, vain, arbitrary, rapacious, cruel, and de∣ceitful: but his character was chiefly marked by a species of low cunning and dissimulation, which, however, overshot his purpose, and contributed to his own ruin.</P>

<P>While the young pretender endeavoured to improve the advan∣tages he had gained, the ministry of Great-Britain took every possible measure to retard his progress. Immediately after the defeat of Cope, six thousand Dutch troops arrived in England, and three battalions of guards, with seven regiments of infantry, were recalled from Flanders for the defence of the king∣dom. They forthwith began their march to the North, under the command of general Wade, who received orders to assemble an army, which proceeded to Newcastle. The parliament meeting on the sixteenth day of October, his ma∣jesty gave them to understand, that an unnatural rebellion had broke out in Scotland, towards the suppression of which he craved their advice and as∣sistance. He found both houses cordial in their addresses, and zealous in their attachment to his person and government. The commons forthwith suspended the habeas corpus act, and several persons were apprehended on suspicion of treasonable practices. Immediately after the session was opened, the duke of Cumberland arrived from the Netherlands, and was followed by another de∣tachment of dragoons and infantry. The trained-bands of London were re∣viewed by his majesty: the county regiments were completed: the volunteers in different parts of the kingdom employed themselves industriously in the ex∣ercise of arms; and the whole English nation seemed to rise up as one man against this formidable invader. The government being apprehensive of a descent from France, appointed admiral Vernon to command a squadron in the Downs, to observe the motions of the enemy by sea, especially in the har∣bours of Dunkirk and Boulogne; and his cruizers took several ships loaded with soldiers, officers, and ammunition, destined for the service of the pretender in Scotland.</P>

<P>This enterprising youth having collected about five thousand men, resolved to make an irruption into England, which he accordingly entered by the west border on the sixth day of November. Carlile was invested, and in less than three days surrendered: here he found a considerable quantity of arms, and was proclaimed king of Great-Britain. General Wade being ap∣prised of his progress, decamped from Newcastle, and advanced across the country as far as Hexham, though the fields were covered with snow, and the roads almost impassable. Here he received intelligence that Carlile was reduced, and forthwith returned to his former station. In the mean time, orders were issued for assembling another army in Staffordshire, under the command of Sir John Ligonier. Prince Charles, notwithstanding this formidable opposition, determined to proceed. He had received assurances from France, that a considerable body of troops would be landed on the southern coast of Britain, to make a diversion in his favour; and he never doubted but that he should be joined by all the English malcontents, as soon as he could penetrate into the heart of the kingdom. Leaving a small garrison in the castle of Carlile, he advanced to Penrith, marching on foot in the Highland garb, at the head of his forces; and continued his route through Lancaster and Preston to Manchester, where, on the twenty-ninth day of the month, he established his head-quarters. Here he was joined by about two hundred Englishmen, who were formed into a regiment, under the com∣mand of colonel Townley. The inhabitants seemed to receive him with marks of affection; and his arrival was celebrated by illuminations and other public
<PB N="667" REF="6700"/>
rejoicings. His intention was to prosecute his march by the way of Chester into Wales, where he hoped to find a great number of adherents; but all the bridges over the river Mersey being broke down, he chose the route to Stock∣port, and forded the river at the head of his division, though the water rose to his middle. He passed through Macclesfield and Congleton; and, on the fourth day of December entered the town of Derby, in which his army was quartered, and himself proclaimed with great formality. He had now advanced within one hundred miles of the capital, which was filled with terror and confusion. Wade lingered in Yorkshire: the duke of Cumberland had as∣sumed the command of the other army assembled in the neighbourhood of Litchfield. He had marched from Stafford to Stone; so that the rebels, in turning off by Ashborne to Derby, had gained a march between him and London. Had this adventurer proceeded in his career with that expedition which he had hitherto used, he might have made himself master of the metropolis, where he would have been certainly joined by a considerable number of his well-wishers, who waited impatiently for his approach: yet this exploit could not have been atchieved without hazarding an engagement. Orders were given for forming a camp on Finchley-common, where the king resolved to take the field in person, accompanied by the earl of Stair, field-marechal and commander in chief of the forces in South-Britain. Some romish priests were apprehended: the militia of London and Middlesex were kept in readiness to march: double watches were posted at the city-gates, and signals of alarm appointed. The volunteers of the city were incorporated into a regiment: the practitioners of the law, headed by the judges: the weavers of Spittlefields, and other com∣munities, engaged in associations; and even the managers of the theatres of∣fered to raise a body of their dependants for the service of the government. Notwithstanding these precautions and appearances of unanimity, the trading part of the city, and those concerned in the money-corporations, were over∣whelmed with fear and dejection. They reposed very little confidence in the courage or discipline of their militia and volunteers: they had received in∣telligence that the French were employed in making preparations at Dunkirk and Calais for a descent upon England: they dreaded an insurrection of the roman catholics, and other friends of the house of Stuart; and they reflected that the Highlanders, of whom by this time they had conceived a most terrible idea, were within four days march of the capital. Alarmed by these con∣siderations, they prognosticated their own ruin in the approaching revolution; and their countenances exhibited the plainest marks of horror and despair. On the other hand, the jacobites were elevated to an insolence of hope, which they were at no pains to conceal; while many people who had no private property to lose, and thought no change would be for the worse, waited the issue of this crisis with the most calm indifference.</P>

<P>This state of suspence was of short duration. The young pre∣tender found himself miserably disappointed in his expectations. He had now advanced into the middle of the kingdom, and, except a few that joined him at Manchester, not a soul appeared in his behalf: one would have imagined that all the jacobites of England had been annihilated. The Welsh took no step towards an insurrection in his favour: the French made no attempt to∣wards an invasion: his court was divided into factions: the Highland chiefs
<PB N="668" REF="6710"/>
began to murmur, and their clans to be unruly: he saw himself with a hand∣ful of men hemmed in between two considerable armies, in the middle of win∣ter, and in a country <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>affected to his cause. He knew he could not pro∣ceed to the metropolis without hazarding a battle, and that a defeat would be attended with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>evitable destruction of himself and all his adherents. He called a council at Derby; and, after violent disputes, the majority deter∣mined, that they should retreat to Scotland with all possible expedition. Ac∣cordingly they abandoned Derby on the sixth day of December, early in the morning, and marched with such cel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity, that on the ninth their van guard arrived at Manchester; on the twelfth they entered Preston, and continued their route northwards. The duke of Cumberland, who was encamped at Meriden, when first apprised of their retreat, detached the horse and dragoons in pursuit of them; while general Wade began his march from Ferrybridge into Lancashire, with a view of intercepting them in their route: but at Wake∣field he understood that they had already reached Wigan; and therefore he repaired to his old post at Newcastle, after having detached general Oglethorpe with his horse and dragoons, to join those who had been sent off from the duke's army. They pursued with such alacrity, that they overtook the rear of the rebels, with which they skirmished in Lancashire. The militia of Cum∣berland and Westmoreland were raised and armed by the duke's order, to harrass them in their march. The bridges were broken down, the roads da∣maged, and the beacons lighted to alarm the country. Nevertheless, they retreated regularly with their small train of artillery. They were overtaken at the village of Clifton, in the neighbourhood of Penrith, by two regiments of dragoons. These alighted in order to attack a party of their rear-guard which had thrown themselves into the place with a view to retard the pursuit. The assailants were roughly handled; and the rebels having accomplished their purpose, retired with the loss of a few individuals, who were either killed or taken. On the nineteenth day of the month, the Highland army reached Carlile, and having reinforced the garrison of the place, crossed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland: having thus accomplished one of the most sur∣prising retreats that ever was performed; but the most remarkable circum∣stance of this expedition, was the moderation and regularity with which those ferocious people conducted themselves in a country abounding with plunder. No violence was offered, no outrage committed; and they were effectually re∣strained from the exercise of rapine. Notwithstanding the excessive cold, the hunger and fatigue to which they must have been exposed, they left behind no sick, nor stragglers; but, retired with deliberation, and carried off their can∣non in the face of their enemy. The duke of Cumberland invested Carlile with his whole army on the twenty-first day of December, and on the thirtieth, the garrison surrendered at discretion. The prisoners amounting to about four hundred, were imprisoned in different gaols in England, and the duke returned to London.</P>

<P>The pretender proceeded by the way of Dumfries to Glasgow, from which last city he exacted severe contributions, on account of its attach∣ment to the government, for whose service it had raised a regiment of nine hundred men, under the command of the earl of Hume. Having continued several days at Glasgow, he advanced towards Stirling, and was joined by some

forces which had been assembled in his absence by lord Lewis Gordon, and John Drummond, brothers to the dukes of Gordon and Perth. This last nobleman had arrived from France in November, with a small reinforcement of French and Irish, and a commission as general of these auxiliaries. He fixed his head-quarters at Perth, where he was reinforced by the earl of Cromartie, and other clans, to the number of two thousand, and he was accommodated with a small train of artillery. They had found means to surprise a sloop of war at Montrose, with the guns of which they fortified that harbour. They had received a considerable sum of money from Spain. They took possession of Dundee, Dumblaine, Down-castle<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and layed Fife under contribution. The earl of London remained at Inverness, with about two thousand Highlanders in the service of his majesty. He raised the blockade of Fort-Augustus, which the son of lord Lovat had formed: he secured the person of that nobleman, who still temporized, and at length accomplished his escape. The laird of Macleod, and Mr. Monro of Culcairn, being detached from Inverness towards Aberdeenshire, were surprised and routed by lord Lewis Gordon at Inverury; and that interest seemed to preponderate in the north of Scotland. Prince Charles being joined by lord John Drummond, invested the castle of Stirling, in which general Blakeney commanded: but, his people were so little used to enterprizes of this kind, that they made very little progress in their operations.</P>

<P>By this time, a considerable body of forces was assembled at Edinburgh, under the conduct of general Hawley, who resolved to relieve Stir∣ling-castle, and advanced to Linlithgow on the thirteenth day of January: next day his whole army rendezvoused at Falkirk, while the rebels lay en∣camped at Torwood. On the seventeenth day of the month, they were per∣ceived in full march to attack the king's forces, which were formed in order of battle, and advanced to the encounter. The enemy had taken possession of a hill on their right; and Hawley ordered two regiments of dragoons to drive them from that eminence. Their prince, who stood in the front of the line, gave the signal to fire, by waving his cap; and his followers took aim so well, that the assailants were broke by the first volley: they retreated with precipita∣tion, and fell in amongst the infantry, which were likewise discomposed by the wind and rain beating with great violence in their faces, wetting their powder, and disturbing their eye-sight. The rebels followed their first blow, and great part of the royal army, after one irregular discharge, turned their backs and fled in the utmost consternation. In all probability few or none of them would have escaped, had not general Huske, and brigadier Cholmondely rallied some regiments, and made a gallant stand, which favoured the retreat of the rest to Falkirk. Among the few that withstood the general pannic on this occasion, was the Glasgow regiment of militia, which had been appointed to guard the baggage, and maintained its ground until it was ordered to retreat. The king's forces retired in confusion to Edinburgh, leaving the field of battle, with part of their tents and artillery, to the rebels: but, their loss of men did not exceed three hundred, including Sir Robert Monro, colonel Whitney, and some other officers of distinction. It was at this period, that the officers who had been taken at Prestonpans, and conveyed to Angus and Fife, finding themselves unguarded, broke their parole, and returned to Edinburgh, on pretence of their having been forcibly released by the inhabitants of those parts.</P>

<P>General Hawley, who had b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asted that, with two regiments of dragoons, he would drive the rebel army from one end of the kingdom to the other, incurred abundance of censure for the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he made, as well as for his conduct before and after the action; but he found means to vindicate him∣self to the satisfaction of his sovereign. Nevertheless it was judged necessary that the army in Scotland should be commanded by a general in whom the soldiers might have some confidence; and the du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of Cumberland was chosen for this purpose. Over and above his being beloved by the army, it was sug∣gested, that the appearance of a prince of the blood, in Scotland, might have a favourable effe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t upon the minds of people in that kingdom: he therefore began to prepare for his northern expedition. Mean wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, the French mini∣ster at the Hague, having represented to the states-general<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the auxiliaries which they had sent into Great-Britain, were part of the garrison of Tournay, and restricted by the capitulation from bearing arms again<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t France for a certain term; they thought proper to recal them, rather than come to an open rup∣ture with his most christian majesty; and in their room six thousand Hessians were transported from Flanders to Leith, where they arrived in the beginning of February, under the command of their prince Frederi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k of Hesse, son-in-law to his Britannic majesty. By this time, the duke of Cumberland had put himself at the head of the troops at Edinburgh, consisting of fourteen batta∣lions of infantry, two regiments of dragoons, and fifteen hundred Highlanders from Argyleshire, under the command of colonel Campbell. On the last day of January, his royal highness began his march to Linlithgow; and the enemy, who had renewed the siege of Stirling-castle, not only abandoned that enter∣prize, but crossed the river Forth with precipitation. Their prince found great difficulty in maintaining his forces, that part of the country being quite ex∣hausted; he hoped to be reinforced in the Highlands, and to receive supplies of all kinds from France and Spain: he, therefore, retired by Bad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>noch towards Inverness, which the earl of Loudon abandoned at his approach. The fort was surrendered to him without opposition, and here he fixed his head-quarters. The duke of Cumberland having secured the important posts of Stirling and Perth, with the Hessian battalions, advanced with the army to Aberdeen, where he was joined by the duke of Gordon, the earls of Aberdeen and Findlater, the laird of Grant, and other persons of distinction.</P>

<P>While he remained in this place, refreshing his troops and pre∣paring magazines, a party of the rebels surprised a detachment of Kingston's horse, and about seventy Argyieshire h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ghlanders, at Keith, who were cut in pieces. Several advanced parties of that militia m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t with the same fate in different places. Lord George Murray invested the castle of Blair, which was defended by Sir Andrew Agnew, until a body of Hessians marched to its relief, and obliged the rebels to retire. They likewise undertook the siege of Fort-William, under the direction of brigadier Stapleton, an engineer in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rench service: but, the place was so vigorously maintained by captain Scot, that in the beginning of April they thought proper to relinquish the enter∣prize. The earl of London had retired into Sutherland, and taken post at Dornoch, where his quarters were beat up by a strong detachment of the rebels command<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by the duke of Perth: a major and sixty men were taken prisone<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and the earl was obliged to take shelter in the isle of Skye. These little checks
<PB N="671" REF="6740"/>
were counter-balanced by some advantages which his majesty's arms obtained. The sloop of war which the rebels had surprised at Montrose, was re-taken in Sutherland, with a considerable sum of money, and a great quantity of arms on board, which she had brought from France for the use of the pretender. In the same county, the earl of Cromarty fell into an ambuscade, and was taken by the militia of Sutherland, who likewise defeated a body of the rebels at Goldspie. This action happened on the very day which has been rendered famous by the victory obtained at Culloden.</P>

<HEAD>§ I.</HEAD>
<P>IN the beginning of April, the duke of Cumberland began his march from Aberdeen; and on the twelsth, passed the de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>p and rapid river Spey, without opposition from the rebels, though a considerable number of them appeared on the opposite side. Why they did not dispute the passage, is not easy to be conceived: but, indeed, from this inst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of neglect, and their subsequent conduct, we may conclude, they were under a total infatuation. His royal highness proceeded to Nairn, where he received intelligence, that the enemy had advanced from Inverness to Culloden, about the distance of nine miles from the royal army<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with intention to give him battle. On the sixteenth day of April, the duke having made the proper dispositions, decamped from N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn early in the morning<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and after a march of nine miles, perceived the Highlanders drawn up in order of battle, to the numb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r of eight thousand men, in thirteen divisions, supp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed with some pieces of artillery. The royal army, which were much more numerous, the duke immediat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly formed into three
<PB N="673" REF="6760"/>
lines, disposed in excellent order; and about one o'clock in the afternoon, the canonading began. The artillery of the rebels was ill served, and did very little execution; but that of the king's troops made dreadful havock among the enemy. Impatient of this fire, their front-line advanced to the attack, and about five hundred of the clans charged the duke's left wing with their usual impetuosity. One regiment was disordered by the weight of this column: but two battalions advancing from the second line, sustained the first, and soon put a stop to their career, by a severe fire, that killed a great number. At the same time, the dragoons under Hawley, and the Argyleshire militia, pulled down a park-wall that covered their right flank, and falling in among them sword in hand, completed their confusion. The French piquets on their left, did not fire a shot; but, stood inactive during the engagement, and after∣wards surrendered themselves prisoners of war. An intire body of the clans marched off the field in order, with their pipes playing: the rest were routed with great slaughter, and their prince was with reluctance prevailed upon to retire. In less than thirty minutes, they were totally defeated, and the field covered with their dead bodies. The road, as far as Inverness, was strewed with dead bodies; and a great number of people, who, from motives of curiosity, had come to see the battle, were sacrificed to the undistinguishing vengeance of the victors. Three thousand rebels were slain on the field, and in the pursuit. The earl of Kilmarnock was taken; and in a few days lord Balmerino surren∣dered himself to one of the detached parties. The glory of the victory was sullied by the barbarity of the soldiers. They had been provoked by their for∣mer disgraces to the most savage thirst of revenge: not contented with the blood which was so profusely shed in the heat of action, they traversed the field after the battle, and massacred those miserable wretches who lay maimed and expiring: nay, some officers acted a part in this cruel scene of assassina∣tion: the triumph of low illiberal minds, uninspired by sentiment, untinc∣tured by humanity. The vanquished adventurer forded the river Ness, and retired with a few horse to Aird, where he conferred with old lord Lovat: then he dismissed his followers, and wandered about a wretched and solitary fugitive among the isles and mountains, for the space of four months, during which he underwent such a series of dangers, hardships and misery, as no other person ever outlived. Thus, in one short hour, all his hope vanished, and the rebellion was intirely extinguished. One would almost imagine, the conductors of this desperate enterprize had conspired their own destruction, as they certainly neglected every step that might have contributed to their safety or succe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. They might have opposed the duke of Cumberland at the passage of the Spey: they might have afterwards attacked his camp in the night, with a good pro∣spect of success. As they were greatly inferior to him in number, and weakened with hunger and fatigue, they might have retired to the hills and fastnesses, where they would have found plenty of live cattle for provision, recruited their regiments, and been joined by a strong reinforcement, which was actually in full march to their assistance. But they were distracted by dissensions and jea∣lousies; obeyed the dictates of despair, and wilfully devoted themselves to ruin and death. When the news of the battle arrived in England, the whole nation was transported with joy, and extolled the duke of Cumberland as a hero and deliverer. Both houses of parliament congratulated his majesty on this auspi∣cious
<PB N="674" REF="6770"/>
event. They decreed, in the most solemn manner, their public thanks to his royal highness, which were transmitted to him by the speakers; and the commons, by bill, added five and twenty thousand pounds per annum to his former revenue.</P>

<P>Immediately after the decisive action at Culloden, he took possession of Inverness; and ordered six and thirty deserters to be executed: then he de∣tached several parties to ravage the country. One of these apprehended the lady Mackintosh, who was sent prisoner to the castle of Edinburgh, plundered her house, and drove away her cattle, though her husband was actually in the service of the government. The castle of lord Lovat was destroyed. The French prisoners were sent to Carlisle and Penrith: Kilmarnock, Balmerino, Cromarty, and his son the lord Macleod, were conveyed by sea to London; and those of an inferior rank were confined in different prisons. The marquis of Tullibardine, together with a brother of the earl of Dunmore, and Murray the pretender's secretary, were seized and transported to the Tower of London, to which the earl of Traquair had been committed on suspicion; and the eldest son of lord Lovat was imprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh. In a word, all the gaols of Great-Britain, from the capital northwards, were filled with those unfortunate captives; and great numbers of them were crowded together in the holds of ships, where they perished in the most deplorable manner, for want of air and exercise. Some rebel chiefs escaped in two French frigates that arrived on the coast of Lochaber about the end of April, and engaged three vessels belonging to his Britannic majesty, which they obliged to retire. Others embarked on board of a ship on the coast of Buchan; and were conveyed to Norway, from whence they travelled to Sweden. In the month of May, the duke of Cumberland advanced with the army into the Highlands, as far as Fort Augustus, where he encamped; and sent off detachments on all hands, to hunt down the fugitives, and lay waste the country with fire and sword. The castles of Glengary and Lochiel were plundered and burned: every house, hutt, or habitation, met with the same fate, without distinction; all the cattle and pro∣vision were carried off; the men were either shot upon the mountains, like wild beasts, or put to death in cold blood, without form of trial; the women, after having seen their husbands and fathers murdered, were subjected to brutal violation, and then turned out naked, with their children, to starve on the barren heaths. One whole family was inclosed in a barn, and consumed to ashes. Those ministers of vengeance were so alert in the execution of the r office, that in a few days there was neither house, cottage, man, nor beast, to be seen in the compass of fifty miles; all was ruin, silence and desolation.</P>

<P>The humane reader cannot reflect upon such a scene without grief and horror; what then must have been the sensation of the fugitive prince, when he beheld these spectacles of woe, the dismal fruit of his ambition? He was now surrounded by armed troops, that chaced him from hill to dale, from rock to cavern, and from shore to shore. Sometimes he lurked in caves and cottages, without attendants, or any other support but that which the poorest peasant could supply. Sometimes he was rowed in fisher-boats from isle to isle, among the Hebrides, and often in sight of his pursuers. For some days he appeared in woman's attire, and even passed through the midst of his enemies, unknown. But, understanding that his disguise was discovered, he assumed
<PB N="675" REF="6780"/>
the habit of a travelling mountaineer, and wandered about among the woods and heaths, with a matted beard and squalid looks, in continual danger of being apprehended, and exposed to cold, hunger, thirst, and weariness. He was obliged to trust his life to the fidelity of above fifty individuals, and many of these were in the lowest paths of fortune. They knew that a price of thirty thousand pounds was set upon his head; and that by betraying him, they should enjoy wealth and affluence: but, they detested the thought of obtaining riches on such infamous terms, and ministred to his necessities, with the ut∣most zeal and fidelity, even at the hazard of their own destruction. In the course of these peregrinations, he was more than once hemmed in by his pur∣suers, in such a manner as seemed to preclude all possibility of escaping; yet, he was never abandoned by his hope and recollection: he still found some ex∣pedient that saved him from captivity and death; and through the wholecourse of his distresses maintained the most amazing equanimity and good humour. At length a privateer of St. Malo, hired by his adherents, arrived in Loch∣nanach; and on the seventeenth day of September, this unfortunate prince embarked in the most wretched attire. He was clad in a short coat of black frize thread-bare, over which was a common highland plaid girt round him by a belt, from whence depended a pistol and a dagger. He had not been shifted for many weeks: his shoes and stockings hung in tatters on his feet and legs. His eye was hollow, his visage wan, and his constitution greatly im∣paired by famine and fatigue. He was accompanied by Sullivan and Sheridan, two Irish adherents, who had shared all his calamities, by Cameron of Lochiel and his brother, and a few other exiles. They set sail for France, and after having been chaced by two English ships of war, arrived in safety at Roscau near Morlaix in Bretagne. Perhaps, he would have found it still more diffi∣cult to escape, had not the vigilance and eagerness of the government been relaxed, in consequence of a report, that he had already fallen among some persons that were slain by a volley from one of the duke's detachments.</P>

<P>Having thus explained the rise, progress, and extinction of the rebel∣lion, it will be necessary to take a retrospective view of the proceedings in par∣liament. The necessary steps being taken for quieting the intestine commotions of the kingdom, the two houses began to convert their attention to the affairs of the continent. On the fourteenth day of January, the king repaired to the house of peers, and in a speech from the throne gave his parliament to understand, that the states-general had made pressing instances for his assist∣ance in the present conjuncture, when they were in such danger of being op∣pressed by the power of France in the Netherlands; that he had promised to co-operate with them towards opposing the further progress of their ene∣mies; and even concerted measures for that purpose. He declared it was with regret that he asked any further aids of his people: he exhorted them to watch over the public credit; and expressed his intire dependance in their zeal and unanimity. He was favoured with loyal addresses, couched in the warmest terms of duty and affection: but the supplies were retarded by new convulsions in the ministry. The earl of G. had made an effort to retrieve his influence in the cabinet, and his sovereign favoured his pretensions. The two brothers, who knew his aspiring genius, and dreaded his superior talents, refused to admit such a colleague into the administration: they even resolved to
<PB N="676" REF="6790"/>
strengthen their party, by introducing fresh auxiliaries into the offices of state. Some of these were personally disagreeable to his majesty, who accordingly re∣jected the suit by which they were recommended. The duke of Newcastle and his brother, with all their adherents, immediately resigned their employments. The earl of Granville was appointed secretary of state, and resumed the reins of administration; but finding himself unequal to the accumulated opposition that preponderated against him; foreseeing that he should not be able to secure the supplies in parliament, and dreading the consequences of that confusion which his restoration had already produced, he, in three days, voluntarily quitted the helm; and his majesty acquiesced in the measures proposed by the opposite party. The seals were re-delivered to the duke of Newcastle and the earl of Harrington: Mr. Pelham, and all the rest who had resigned, were re∣instanted in their respective employments; and offices were conferred on several individuals who had never before been in the service of the government. Wil∣liam Pitt, Esq; was appointed vice-treasurer of Ireland, and soon promoted to the place of paymaster-general of the forces; at the same time the king de∣clared him a privy-counsellor. This gentleman had been originally designed for the army, in which he actually bore a commission; but fare reserved him for a more important station. In point of fortune he was barely qualified to be elected member of parliament, when he obtained a seat in the house of com∣mons, where he soon outshone all his compatriots. He displayed a surprising extent and precision of political knowledge, an irresistable energy of argument, and such power of elocution, as struck his hearers with astonishment and ad∣miration. It flashed like the lightning of heaven against the ministers and sons of corruption, blasting where it smote, and withering the nerves of opposition: but his more substantial praise was founded upon his disiterested integrity, his incorruptible heart, his unconquerable spirit of independance, and his invari∣able attachment to the interest and liberty of his country.</P>

<P>The quiet of the ministry being re-established, the house of commons provided for forty thousand seamen, nearly the same number of land-forces, besides fifteen regiments raised by the nobility, on account of the rebellion, and about twelve thousand marines. They settled funds for the maintenance of the Dutch and Hessian troops that were in England, as well as for the subsidy to the landgrave. They granted three hundred thousand pounds to the king of Sardinia; four hundred thousand pounds to the queen of Hungary; three hundred and ten thousand pounds to defray the expence of eighteen thousand Hanoverians; about three and thirty thousand pounds in subsidies to the electors of Mentz and Cologne; and five hundred thousand pounds in a vote of credit and confidence to his majesty. The whole charge of the current year amounted to seven millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, which was raised by the land and malt-taxes, annuities on the additional duties imposed on glass, and spirituous liquors, a lottery, a deduction from the sinking fund, and exchequer bills, chargeable on the first aids that should be granted in the next session of parliament.</P>

<P>The rebellion being quelled, the legislature resolved to make examples of those who had been concerned in disturbing the peace of their country. In June an act of attainder was passed against the principal persons who had em∣barked in that desperate undertaking; and courts were opened in different parts
<PB N="677" REF="6800"/>
of England, for the trial of the prisoners. Seventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at Kennington-common, in the neighbourhood of London, and suffered with great constancy under the dreadful tortures which their sen∣tence prescribed: nine were put to death, in the same manner, at Carlisle; six at Brumpton, seven at Penrith, and eleven at York: a few obtained pardons, and a considerable number were transported to the plantations. Bills of in∣dictment for high-treason were found by the county of Surry against the earls of Kilmarnock and Cromartie, and the lord Balmerino. These noble∣men were tried by their peers in Westminster-hall, the lord chancellor presiding as lord high-steward for the occasion. The two earls confessed their crime, and in pathetic speeches recommended themselves to his majesty's mercy. Lord Balmerino pleaded not guilty: he denied his having been at Carlisle at the time specified in the indictment; but this exception was over-ruled: then he moved a point of law in arrest of judgment, and was allowed to be heard by his counsel. They might have expatiated on the hardship of being tried by an ex post facto law, and claimed the privilege of trial in the county where the act of treason was said to have been committed. The same hardship was imposed upon all the imprisoned rebels: they were dragged in captivity to a strange country, far from their friends and connexions, destitute of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to produce evidence in their favour, even if they had been innocent of the charge. Balmerino waived this plea, and submitted to the court, which pronounced sen∣tence of death upon him and his two associates. Cromartie's life was spared; but the other two were beheaded, in the month of August, on Tower-hill. Kilmar∣nock was a nobleman of fine personal accomplishments: he had been educated in revolution principles, and engaged in the rebellion, partly from the desperate situation of his fortune, and partly from resentment to the government, on his being deprived of a pension which he had for some time enjoyed. He was convinced of his having acted criminally, and died with marks of penitence and contrition. Balmerino had been bred to arms, and acted upon principle: he was unpolished in his manners, brave, rough, and resolute, eyed the imple∣ments of death with the most careless familiarity, and seemed to triumph in his sufferings. In November, Mr. Ratcliff, the titular earl of Derwentwater, who had been taken in a ship bound to Scotland, was arraigned on a former sen∣tence, passed against him in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixteen: he refused to acknowledge the authority of the court, and pleaded that he was a subject of France, honoured with a commission in the service of his most christian majesty. The identity of his person being proved, a rule was made for his execution; and on the eighth day of December he suffered decapita∣tion, with the most perfect composure and serenity. Lord Lovat, now turned of fourscore, was impeached by the commons, and tried in Westminster-hall before the lord high-steward. John Murray, secretary to the prince-pretender, and some of his own domestics appearing against him, he was convicted of high∣treason, and condemned. Notwithstanding his age, infirmities, and the recol∣lection of his conscience, which was supposed to be not altogether void of of∣fence, he died like an old Roman, exclaiming, <Q>“dulce et decorum pro patria m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.”</Q> He surveyed the crowd with attention, examined the axe, jested with the executioner, and layed his head upon the block with the utmost indiffe∣rence. From this last scene of his life one would have concluded, that he had
<PB N="678" REF="6810"/>
approved himself a patriot from his youth, and never deviated from the paths of virtue.</P>

<P>The flame of war on the continent did not expire at the election of an emperor, and the re-establishment of peace among the princes of the empire. On the contrary, it rag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with double v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lence in consequence of these events; for the force that was before divided being now united in one body, exerted itself with greater vigour and rapidity. The state<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>general were overwhelmed with consternation. Notwithstanding the pains they had taken to avoid a war, and the condeso<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nsion with which they had soothed and supplicated the French mo∣narch in repeated embassies and memorials, they saw themselves stripped of their barrier, and once more in danger of being overwhelmed by that ambitious nation. The city of Brussels had been reduced during the winter; so that the enemy were in possession of all the Austrian Netherlands, except a few fortresses. Great part of the forces belonging to the republic were restricted from action by capitulations, to which they had subscribed. The states were divided in their councils between the two factions which had long subsisted. They trembled at the prospect of seeing Zealand invaded in the spring. The Orange party loudly called for an augmentation of their forces by sea and land, that they might pro∣secute the war with vigour. The common people, fond of novelty, dazzled by the splendor of greatness, and fully persuaded, that nothing but a chief was wanting to their security, demanded the prince of Orange as a stadtholder; and even mingled menaces with their demands. The opposite faction dreaded alike the power of a stadtholder, the neighbourhood of a French army, and the seditious disposition of the populace. An ambassador was sent to London with repre∣sentations of the imminent dangers which threatened the republic; and he was ordered to sollicit in the most pressing terms the assistance of his Britannic ma∣jesty, that the allies might have a superiority in the N<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>herlands by the begin∣ning of the campaign. The king was very well disposed to comply with their request; but the rebellion in his kingdom, and the dissensions in his cabinet, had retarded the supplies, and embarrassed him so much, that he found it im∣possible to make those early preparations that were ne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ssary to check the career of the enemy.</P>

<P>The king of France, with his general the count de S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xe, took the field in the latter end of April, at the head of one hundred and twenty thousand men, and advanced towards the allies, who, to the number of four and forty thousand, were intrenched behind the Demer, under the conduct of the Austrian general Bathiani, who retired before them, and took post in the neighbourhood of Breda, the capital of Dutch Brabant. Marechal Saxe immediately invested Antwerp, which in a few days was surrendered. Then he appeared before the strong town of Mons in Hainault, with an irresistible train of artillery, an immense quantity of bombs and warlike implements, and carried on his ap∣proaches with such unabating impetuosity, that notwithstanding a very vigorous defence, the garrison was obliged to capitulate on the twenty-seventh day of June, in about eight and twenty days after the place had been invested. Sieges were not now carried on by the tediou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> method of sapping. The French king found it much more expedi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous and effectual to bring into the field a prodi∣gious train of battering cannon, and enormous mortars, that kept up such a fire as no garrison could sustain, and discharged such an incessant hail of bombs
<PB N="679" REF="6820"/>
and bullets, as in a very little time reduced to ruins the place, with all its fortifi∣cations. St. Guislain and Charleroy met with the fate of Mons and Antwerp; so that by the middle of July the French king was absolute master of Flanders, Brabant, and Hainault.</P>

<P>Prince Charles of Lorraine had by this time assumed the command of the confederate army at Terheyde, which being reinforced by the Hessian troops from Scotland, and a fresh body of Austrians under count Palfi, amounted to eighty-seven thousand men, including the Dutch forces commanded by the prince of Waldeck. The generals, supposing the next storm would fall upon Namur, marched towards that place, and took post in an advantageous situation on the eighteenth day of July, in sight of the French army, which was encamped at Gemblours. Here they remained till the eighth day of August, when a detach∣ment of the enemy, commanded by count Lowendahl, took possession of Huy, where he found a large magazine belonging to the confederates; and their communication with Maestricht was cut off. Marechal Saxe, on the other side, took his measures so well, that they were utterly deprived of all subsistence. Then prince Charles retiring across the Maeze, abandoned Namur to the efforts of the enemy, by whom it was immediately invested. The trenches were opened on the second day of September; and the garrison, consisting of seven thousand Austrians, defended themselves with equal skill and resolution; but, the cannonading and bombardment were so terrible, that in a few days the place was converted into a heap of rubbish; and on the twenty-third day of the month the French monarch took possession of this strong fortress, which had formerly sustained such dreadful attacks. Mean while the allied army encamped at Maestricht, were joined by Sir John Ligonier, with some British and Bavarian battalions; and prince Charles resolved to give the enemy battle. With this view he passed the Maeze on the thirteenth day of September, and advanced towards marechal Saxe, whom he found so advantageously posted at Tongres, that he thought proper to march back to Maestricht. On the twenty-sixth day of September he crossed the Jaar in his retreat; and his rear was attacked by the enemy, who were repulsed. But, count Saxe being reinforced by a body of troops, under the count de Clermont, determined to bring the confederates to an engagement. On the thirteenth day of the month he passed the Jaar, while they took possession of the villages of Liers, Warem, and Roucoux, drew up their forces in order of battle, and made preparations for giving him a warm reception. On the first day of October the enemy advanced in three columns; and a terrible cannonading began about noon. At two o'clock prince Waldeck on the left was charged with great fury; and after an obstinate defence over∣powered by numbers. The villages were attacked in columns, and as one brigade was repulsed another succeeded; so that the allies were obliged to abandon these posts, and retreat towards Maestricht, with the loss of five thou∣sand men, and thirty pieces of artillery. The victory, however, cost the French general a much greater number of lives; and was attended with no solid ad∣vantage. Sir John Ligonier, the earls of Crawford<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This nobleman, so remarkable for his courage and thirst of glory, exhibited a very extraordinary instance of pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of mind on the morning that preceded this battle. He and some volunteers, accompanied by his aid-du-camp, and attended by two orderly dragoons, had rode out before day to reconnoitre the situation of the enemy; and fell in upon one of their advanced guards. The serjeant who commanded it immediate<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y turned ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his men, and their pieces w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re presented when the earl fir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t perce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed them.

<P>The campaign in Italy was altogether unfavourable to the French and Spaniards. The house of Austria being no longer pressed on the side of Ger∣many, was enabled to make the stronger efforts in this country<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Bri∣tish subsidy encouraged the king of Sardinia to act with redoubled vivacity. Marechal Mallebois occupied the greater part of Piedmont with about thirty thousand men. Don Philip and the count de Gages were at the head of a greater number in the neighbourhood of Milan; and the duke of Modena, with eight thousand, secured his own dominions. The king of Sardinia augmented his for<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es to six and thirty thousand; and the Austrian army, under the prince of Lichtenstein<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amounted to a much greater number; so that the enemy were reduced to the necessity of acting on the defensive, and retired towards the Mantuan. In February baron Leutrum the Piedmontese general, invested and took the strong fortress of Aste. He afterwards relieved the citadel of Alex∣andria, which the Spaniards had blocked up in the winter, reduced Casal, recovered Valencia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and obliged Mallebois to retire to the neighbourhood of Genoa. On the other side, Don Philip and count Gages abandoned Milan, Pavi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Parma, re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reating before the Austrians with the utmost precipitation, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>centia, where they were joined on the third of June by the French forces under Mallebois.</P>

<P>Before this junction was effected the Spanish general Pignatelli, had passed the river Po in the night with a strong detachment, and beaten up the quarters of seven thousa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Austrians posted at Codogno. Don Philip find<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng himself at the head o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> two and fifty thousand men by his junction with the French general, resolved to attack the Austrians in their camp at San Lazaro, before they should be reinforced by his Sardinian majesty. Accordingly, on the fourth day of June in the evening, he marched with equal silence and expedi∣tion, and entered the Austrian trenches about eleven, when a desperate battle ensued. The Austrians were pr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pared for the attack, which they sustained with great vigour till morning. Then they quitted their intrenchments, and charged the enemy in their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with such fury, that after an obstinate resistance the
<PB N="681" REF="6840"/>
combined army was broke, and retired with precipitation to Placentia, leaving on the field fifteen thousand men killed, wounded, and taken, together with sixty colours, and ten pieces of artillery. In a few weeks the Austrians were joined by the Piedmontese: the king of Sardinia assumed the chief command, and prince Lichtenstein being indisposed, his place was supplied by the marquis de Botta. Don Philip retired to the other side of the Po, and extended his troops in the open country of the Milaneze. The king of Sardinia called a council of war, in which it was determined, that he should pass the river with a strong body of troops, in order to straiten the enemy on one side; while the marquis de Botta should march up the Tydone, to cut off their communication with Placentia. They forthwith quitted all the posts they had occupied between the Lambro and Adda, resolving to repass the Po, and retreat to Tortona. With this view they threw bridges of boats over that river, and began to pass on the ninth day of August in the evening. They were attacked at Rotto Freddo by a detachment of Austrians, under general Serbelloni, who maintained the engagement till ten in the morning, when Botta arrived: the battle was renewed with redoubled rage, and lasted till four in the afternoon, when the enemy retired in great disorder to Tortona, with the loss of eight thousand men, a good number of colours and standards, and eighteen pieces of cannon. This victory cost the Austrians four thousand men killed upon the spot, including the gallant general Bernclau. The victors immediately summoned Placentia to su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>render; and the garrison, consisting of nine thousand men, were made pri∣soners of war: Don Philip continued his retreat, and of all his forces brought six and twenty thousand only into the territories of Genoa.</P>

<P>The Piedmontese and Austrians rejoining in the neighbourhood of Pavia, advanced to Tortona, of which they took possession without resistance; while the enemy sheltered themselves under the cannon of Genoa. They did not long continue in this situation; for on the twenty-second day of August they were again in motion, and retired into Provence. The court of Madrid imputing the bad success of this campaign to the misconduct of count Gages, recalled that general, and sent the marquis de las Minas to resume the command of the forces. In the mean time the victorious confederates appeared before Genoa on the fourth day of December; and the senate of that city thinking it incapa∣ble of defence, submitted to a very mortifying capitulation, by which the gates were delivered up to the Austrians, together with all their arms, artillery, and ammunition; and the city was subjected to the most cruel contributions. The marquis de Botta being left at Genoa with sixteen thousand men, the king of Sardinia resolved to pass the Var, and pursue the French and Spaniards into Provence; but, that monarch being seized with the small-pox, the conduct of this expedition was intrusted to count Brown, an Austrian general of Irish extract, who had given repeated proofs of uncommon valour and capacity. He was on this occasion assisted by vice-admiral Medley, who commanded the British squadron in the Mediterranean. The French forces had fortified the passes of the Var, under the conduct of the marechal de Belleisle, who thought proper to abandon his posts at the approach of count Brown; and this general, at the head of fifty thousand men, passed the river without opposition, on the ninth day of November. While he advanced as far as Draguignan, laying the open country under contribution, baron Roth, with four and twenty battalions,
<PB N="682" REF="6850"/>
invested Antibes, which was at the same time bombarded on the side of the sea by the British squadron. The trenches were opened on the twentieth day of September; but, Belleisle having assembled a numerous army, superior to that of the confederates, and the Genoese having expelled their Austrian gu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts, count Brown abandoned the enterprize, and repassed the Var, not with∣out some damage from the enemy.</P>

<P>The court of Vienna, which has always patronized oppression, exacted such heavy contributions from the Genoese, and its directions were so rigor∣ously put in execution, that the people were reduced to despair; and resolved to make a last effort for the recovery of their l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>berty and independence. Ac∣cordingly they took arms in secret, seized several important posts of the city; surpr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed some battalions of the Austrians; surrounded oth<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, and cut them in pieces; and in a word, drove them out with great slaughter. The marquis de Botta acted with caution and spirit; but being overpowered by numbers, and apprehensive of the peasants in the country, who were in arms, he retreated to the pass of the Bochett<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the side of Lombardy, where he secured himself in an advantageou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuation, until he could receive reinforcements. The loss he had sustained at Genoa did not hinder him from reducing Savona, a sea-port town belonging to that republic; and he afterwards made himself master of Gavi. The Genoese, on the contrary, exerted themselves with wonderful in∣dustry in fortifying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir city, raising troops, and in taking other measures for a vigorous defence, in case they should again be insulted.</P>

<P>The naval transactions of this year reflected very little honour on the British nation. Commodore Peyton, who commanded six ships of war in the East-Indies, shamefully declined a decisive engagement with a French squadron of inferior force; and abandoned the important settlement of Madrass on the coast of Coromandel, which was taken without opposition in the month of September, by the French commodore de la Bourdonnais. Fort St. David, and the other British factories in India, would have probably shared the same fate, had not the enemy's naval force in that country been shattered and partly destroyed by a terrible tempest. No event of consequence happened in America, though it was a scene that s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to promise the greatest success to the arms of England. The red<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ction of Cape-Breton had encouraged the ministry to project the conquest of Quebec, the capital of Canada, situated upon the river of St. Laurence<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Commissions were sent to the governors of the British colonies in North-America, impowering them to raise companies to join the armament from England; and eight thousand troops were actually raised in consequence of these directions; while a po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erful squadron and transports, having six regiments on board, were prepared at Portsmouth for this expedition. But their depar∣ture was po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tponed by unaccountable delays, until the season was judged too far advanced to risque the great ships on the boisterous coast of North-America. That the armament, howev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght not be wholly useless to the nation, it was employed in making a descent upon the coast of Brittany<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the supposition, that Port L'Orient, the repository of all the stores and ships belonging to the French East-India company, might be surprised; or, that this invasion would ala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m the enemy, and, by making a diversion, facilitate the operations of the Austrian general in Provence.</P>

<P>The naval force intended for this service consisted of sixteen great ships, and eight frigates, besides bomb-ketches, and storeships, commanded by Richard Lestock, appointed admiral of the blue-division. Six battalions of land troops, with a detachment of matrosses and bombardiers, were embarked in thirty transports, under the conduct of lieutenant-general Sinclair; and the whole fleet set sail from Plymouth on the fourteenth day of September. On the twentieth the troops were landed in Quimperlay-bay, at the distance of ten miles from Port L'Orient. The militia, reinforced by some detachments from different regiments, were assembled to the number of two thousand, and seemed resolved to oppose the disembarkation; but, seeing the British troops determined to land at all events, they thought proper to retire. Next day general Sinclair advanced into the country, skirmishing with the enemy in his route; and arriving at the village of Plemure, within half a league from Port L'Orient, summoned that place to surrender. He was visited by a deputation from the town, which offered to admit the British forces, on condition, that they should be restrained from pillaging the inhabitants, and touching the magazines; and, that they should pay a just price for their provisions. These terms being rejected, the inhabitants prepared for a vigorous defence; and the English general resolved to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iege the place in form: though he had neither time, artillery, nor forces <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for such an enterprize. All his cannon amounted to no more than a few fie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> pieces; and he was obliged to wait for two iron guns, which the sailors <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up from the shipping. Had he given the assault on the first night after <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrival, when the town was filled with terror and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onfusion, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>titute of regular troops, in all probability it would have been eas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y taken by sealade. But the reduction of it was rendered impractica∣ble by his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elay The ramparts were mounted with cannon from the ships in the harbour; new works were raised with great industry; the garrison was reinforce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by several bodies of regular troops, and great numbers were assembling from all parts; so that the British forces were in danger of being surrounded in an enemy's country. Notwithstanding these discouragements, they opened a small battery against the town, which was set on fire in several places by their bombs and re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hot bui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ets: they likewise repulsed part of the garrison which had made a saily to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estroy their works; but their cannon producing no effect upon the fortifications, the fire from the town daily increasing, and admiral Lestock declaring, in repeated messages, that he could no longer expose the ships on an open coast at such a season of the year; general Sinclair abandoned the siege; and having caused the two iron pieces of cannon to be buried, retreated in good order to the sea-side, where his troops were reimbarked, having sustained very inconsiderable damage since their first landing. He expected reinforcements from England, and was resolved to wait a little longer for their arrival, in hope of being able to annoy the enemy more effectually. In the beginning of October the fleet sailed to Quiberon-bay, where they destroyed a French ship of war; and a detachment of the forces being landed, took possession of a fort on the peninsula; while the little islands of Houvat and Heydic were reduced by the sailors. In this situation the admiral and general continued till the seventeenth day of the month, when the forts being dismantled, and the troops reimbarked, the fleet sailed from the French coast: the admiral returned to England, and the transports with the soldiers proceeded to Ireland, where they arrived in safety.</P>

or proposal of the government and its ministers. The commons having considered the estimates, voted forty thousand seamen for the service of the ensuing year, and about sixty thousand land-forces, including eleven thousand five hundred marines. They granted four hundred and thirty three thousand pounds to the empress queen of Hungary; three hundred thousand pounds to the king of Sardinia; four hundred and ten thousand pounds for the mainte∣nance of eighteen thousand Hanoverian auxiliaries; one hundred and sixty-one thousand six hundred and seven pounds, for six thousand Hessians; sub∣sidies to the electors of Cologne, Mentz, and Bavaria; and the sum of five hundred thousand pounds to enable his majesty to prosecute the war with ad∣vantage. In a word, the supplies amounted to nine millions, four hundred twenty-five thousand two hundred fifty-four pounds; a sum almost incredible, if we consider how the kingdom had been already drained of its treasure. It was raised by the usual taxes, reinforced with new impositions on windows, carriages, and spirituous liquors, a lottery, and loan from the sinking-fund. The new taxes were mortgaged for four millions by transferable annuities, at an interest of four, and a premium of ten per centum. By reflecting on these enormous grants, one would imagine the ministry had been determined to im∣poverish the nation; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the eagerness and expedition with which the people subscribed for the money, one would conclude that the riches of the kingdom were inexhaustible. It may not be amiss to observe, that the supplies of this year exceeded, by two millions and a half, the greatest annual sum that was raised during the reign of queen Anne, though she maintained as great a number of troops as was now in the pay of Great Britain, and her armies and fleets acquired every year fresh harvests of glory and advantage: whereas this war had proved an almost uninterrupted series of events big with disaster and dishonour. During the last two years, the naval expence of England had ex∣ceeded that of France about five millions sterling; though her fleets had not obtained one signal advantage over the enemy at sea, nor been able to protect her commerce from their depredations. She was at once a prey to her declared adversaries and professed friends. Before the end of summer, she numbered among her mercenaries two empresses, five German princes, and a powerful monarch, whom she hired to assist her in trimming the balance of Europe, in which they themselves were immediately interested, and she had no more than a secondary concern. Had these fruitless subsidies been saved; had the na∣tional revenue been applied with o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>conomy to national purposes; had it been employed in liquidating gradually the public incumbrances, in augmenting the navy, improving manufactures, encouraging and securing the colonies, and extending trade and navigation; corruption would have become altogether un∣necessary, and disaffection would have vanished: the people would have been eased of their burthens, and ceased to complain: commerce would have flourished, and produced such affluence as must have raised Great-Britain to the highest pinnacle of maritime power, above all rivalship or competition.

<P>The king, in order to exhibit a specimen of his desire to diminish the public expence, ordered the third and fourth troops of his life-guards to be disbanded, and reduced three regiments of horse to the quality of dragoons. The house of commons presented an address of thanks for this instance of oeconomy, by which the annual sum of seventy thousand pounds was saved to the nation. Notwithstanding this seeming harmony between the king and the great council of the nation, his majesty resolved, with the advice of his council, to dissolve the present parliament, though the term of seven years was not yet expired since its first meeting. The ministry affected to insinuate, that the states-general were unwilling to concur with his majesty in vigorous measures against France, during the existence of a parliament which had undergone such a vicissitude of complexion. The allies of Great-Britain, far from being suspicious of this assembly, which had supplied them so liberally, saw with concern, that, according to law, it would soon be dismissed; and they doubted whether another could be procured equally agreeable to their purposes. In order to remove this doubt, the ministry resolved to surprise the kingdom with a new election, before the malcontents should be prepared to oppose the friends of the government. Accordingly, when the business of the session was dis∣patched, the king having given the royal asient to the several acts they had prepared, dismissed them in the month of June, with an affectionate speech that breathed nothing but tenderness and gratitude. The parliament was im∣mediately dissolved by proclamation, and new writs were issued for convoking another. Among the laws passed in this session, was an act abolishing the heritable jurisdictions, and taking away the tenor of wardholdings in Scotland, which were reckoned among the principal sources of those rebellions that had been excited since the revolution. In the Highlands, they certainly kept the common people in subjection to their chiefs, whom they implicitly followed and obeyed in all their undertakings. By this act these mountaineers were le∣gally emancipated from slavery: but as the tenants enjoyed no leases, and were at all times liable to be ejected from their tarms, they still depended on the pleasure of their lords, notwithstanding this interposition of the legislature, which granted a valuable consideration in money to every nobleman and petty baron, who was thus deprived of one part of his inheritance. The forfeited estates, indeed, were divided into small farms, and let by the government on leases at an under-value; so that those who had the good fortune to obtain such leases tasted the sweets of independence: but the Highlanders in general were left in their original indigence and incapacity, at the mercy of their superiors. Had manufactures and fisheries been established in different parts of their country, they would have seen and felt the happy consequences of industry, and in a little time been effectually detached from all their slavish connections.</P>

<P>The operations of the campaign had been concerted in the winter, at the Hague, between the duke of Cumberland and the states-general of the
<PB N="687" REF="6900"/>
United-Provinces, who were by this time generally convinced of France's de∣sign to encroach upon their territories. They therefore determined to take ef∣fectual measures against that restless and ambitious neighbour. The allied powers agreed to assemble a vast army in the Netherlands; and it was resolved that the Austrians and Piedmontese should once more penetrate into Provence. The Dutch patriots, however, were not roused into this exertion, until all their remonstrances had failed at the court of Versailles; until they had been urged by repeated memorials of the English ambassador, and stimulated by the im∣mediate danger to which their country was exposed: for France was by this time possessed of all the Austrian Netherlands, and seemed bent upon pene∣trating into the territories of the United-Provinces. In February, the duke of Cumberland began to assemble the allied forces; and in the latter end of March they took the field in three separate bodies. His royal highness, with the English, Hanoverians, and Hessians, fixed his head quarters at the village of Tilberg: the prince of Waldeck was posted with the Dutch troops at Breda; and marechal Bathiani collected the Austrians and Bavarians in the neighbour∣hood of Venlo. The whole army amounted to one hundred and twenty thou∣sand men, who lay inactive six weeks, exposed to the inclemency of the weather, and almost destitute of forage and provision. Count Saxe, by this time created marechal-general of France, continued his troops within their cantonements at Bruges, Antwerp, and Brussels, declaring, that when the allied army should be weakened by sickness and mortality, he would convince the duke of Cumberland, that the first duty of a general is to provide for the health and preservation of his troops. In April this fortunate commander took the field, at the head of one hundred and forty thousand men; and the count de Clermont commanded a separate body of ninteen battalions and thirty squadrons. Count Lowendahl was detached on the sixteenth day of the month, with seven and twenty thousand men, to invade Dutch Flanders: at the same time, the French minister at the Hague presented a memorial to the states, intimating, that his master was obliged to take this step by the ne∣cessity of war: but that his troops should observe the strictest discipline, without interfering with the religion, government, or commerce of the re∣public: that the countries and places of which he might be obliged to take possession, should be detained no otherwise than as a pledge, to be restored as soon as the United-Provinces should give convincing proofs that they would no longer furnish the enemies of France with succours.</P>

<P>While the states deliberated upon this declaration, count Lowen∣dahl entered Dutch Brabant, and invested the town and fortress of Sluys, the garrison of which surrendered themselves prisoners of war on the nineteenth day of April. This was likewise the fate of Sas-van Ghent; while the mar∣quis de Contades, with another detachment reduced the forts Perle and Leif∣kenshoek, with the town of Philippine, even within hearing of the confederate army. The fort of Sanberg was vigorously defended by two English battalions; but they were overpowered and obliged to retire to Welsthoorden; and count Lowendahl undertook the siege of Hulst, which was shamefully surrendered by La Roque the Dutch governor, though he knew that a reinforcement of nine battalions was on the march to his relief. Then the French general took possession of Axel and Terneuse, and began to prepare flat-bottomed boats for

The vigorous consequences of this resolution immediately appeared. All commerce and contracts with the French were prohibited: the peasants were armed and exercised: a resolution passed for making a con∣siderable augmentation of the army: a council of war was established, for inquiring into the conduct of the governors, who had given up the frontier places; and orders were issued to commence hostilities against the French, both by sea and land.</P>

<P>Mean while, the duke of Cumberland took post with his whole army between the two Nethes, to cover Bergen-op Zoom and Maestricht; and marechal Saxe called in his detachments, with a view to hazard a general engagement. In the latter end of May, the French king arrived at Brussels; and his general resolved to undertake the siege of Maestricht. For this pur∣pose he advanced towards Louvain; and the confederates perceiving his drift, began their march to take post between the town and the enemy. On the twentieth day of June, they took possession of their ground, and were drawn up in order of battle, with their right at Bilsen, and their left extending to Wir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, within a mile of Maestricht, having in the front of their left wing the village of Laffel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, in which they posted several battalions of British infantry. The French had taken possession of the heights of Herdeeren, immediately above the allies; and both armies cannonaded each other till the evening. In the morning, the enemy's infantry marched down the hill, in a prodigious column, and attacked the village of La<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eldt, which was well fortified and defended with surprising obstinacy. The assailants suffered terribly in their approach, from the cannon of the confederates, which was served with sur∣prising <NOTE PLACE="marg"># Not the person who commanded in the West-Indies.</NOTE>
<PB N="689" REF="6920"/>
dexterity and success; and they met with such a warm reception from the British musquetry as they could not withstand: but, when they were broken and dispersed, fresh brigades succeeded with astonishing perseverance. The con∣federates were driven out of the village; yet being sustained by three regiments, they measured back their ground, and repulsed the enemy with great slaughter. Nevertheless, count Saxe continued pouring in other battalions; and the French regained and maintained their footing in the village, after it had been three times lost and carried. The action was chiefly confined to this post, where the field exhibited a horrible scene of carnage. At noon the duke of Cumberland ordered the whole left wing to advance against the enemy, whose infantry gave way: prince Waldeck led up the centre, marechal Bathiani made a motion with the right wing towards Herdeeren, and victory seemed ready to declare for the confederates; when the fortune of the day took a sudden turn to their prejudice. Several squadrons of Dutch horse, posted in the centre, gave way, and flying at full gallop, overthrew five battalions of infantry that were ad∣vancing from the body of reserve. The French cavalry charged them with great impetuosity, increasing the confusion that was already produced, and penetrating through the lines of the allied army, which was thus divided about the centre. The duke of Cumberland, who exerted himself with equal cou∣rage and activity, in attempting to remedy this disorder, was in danger of being taken; and the defeat would, in all probability, have been total, had not Sir John Ligonier taken the resolution of sacrificing himself and a part of the troops to the safety of the army. At the head of three British regiments of dragoons, and some squadrons of Imperial horse, he charged the whole line of the French cavalry, with such intrepidity and success, that he over∣threw all that opposed him, and made such a diversion as enabled the duke of Cumberland to effect an orderly retreat to Maestricht. He himself was taken by a French carabineer, after his horse had been killed; but the regiments he commanded retired with deliberation. The confederates retreated to Mae∣stricht, without having sustained much damage from the pursuit, and even brought off all their artillery except sixteen pieces of cannon. Their loss did not <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> six thousand men killed and taken; whereas the French general <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> at a much greater expence. The common cause of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is said to have suffered from the pride and ignorance of their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the eve of the battle, when the detachment of the count de <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> on the hill of Herdeeren, marechal Bathiani asked <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in chief to attack them before they should be <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he would answer for the success of the enterprize.

He replied, <Q>“I shall <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be found at the head of my troops,”</Q> and retired in disgust. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> disposition has likewise been blamed, inasmuch as not above one half of the army could act, while the enemy exerted their whole force.</P>

<P>The confederates passed the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, and encamped in the dutchy of Limburg, so as to cover Maestricht; while the French king remained with his army in the neighbourhood of Tongres. Marechal Saxe, having amused the allies with marches and counter-marches, at length detached count Lowen∣dahl with six and thirty thousand men to besiege Bergen-op-zoom, the strongest
<PB N="690" REF="6930"/>
fortification of Datch Braban<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the favourite work of the famous engineer Cochorn, never conquered, and generally esteemed invincible. It was secured with a garrison of three thousand men, and well provided with artillery, am∣munition, and magazines. The enemy appeared before it on the twelfth day of July, and summoned the governor to surrender. The prince of Saxe-Hild∣burghausen was sent to its relief, with twenty battalions and fourteen squadrons of the troops that could be most conveniently assembled: he entered the lines of Bergen-op-zoom, where he remained in expectation of a strong reinforce∣ment from the confederate army; and the old baron Cronstrom, whom the stadtholder had appointed governor of Brabant, assumed the command of the garrison. The besiegers carried on their operations with great vivacity; and the troops in the town defended it with equal vigour. The eyes of all Europe were turned upon this important siege<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> count Lowendahl received divers rein∣forcements; and a considerable body of troops was detached from the allied army, under the command of baron Schwartzemberg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to co-operate with the prince of S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xe-Hildburghausen. The French general lost a great number of men by the close and continual fire of the besieged; while he, in his turn, opened such a number of batteries, and plied them so warmly, that the defences began to give way. From the sixteenth day of July to the fifteenth of Sep∣tember, the siege produced an unintermitting scene of horror and destruction: desperate sallies were made, and mines sprung with the most dreadful effects: the works began to be shartered, the town was laid in ashes, the trenches were filled with carnage: nothing was seen but fire and smoke; nothing heard but one continued roar of bombs and cannon. But, still the damage fell chiefly on the besiegers, who were slain in heaps; while the garrison suffered very little, and could be occasionally relieved or reinforced from the lines. In a word, it was generally believed that count Lowendahl would be baffled in his endea∣vours; and by this belief the governor of Bergen-op-zoom seems to have been lulled into a blind security. At length, some inconsiderable breaches were made in one ravelin and two bastions, and these the French general resolved to storm, though Cronstrom believed they were impracticable; and on that sup∣position, presumed that the enemy would not attempt an assault. For this very reason count Lowendahl resolved to hazard the attack, before the preparations should be made for his reception. He accordingly regulated his dispositions, and at four o'clock in the morning, on the sixteenth day of September, the signal was made for the assault. A prodigious quantity of bombs being thrown into the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avelin, his troops threw themselves into the fosse, mounted the breaches, forced open a sally-port, and entered the place, almost without resistance. In a word, they had time to extend themselves along the curtains, and form in order of battle, before the garrison could be assembled. Constrom was asleep, and the soldiers upon duty had been surprised by the suddenness and impetuosity of the attack. Though the French had taken possession of the ramparts, they did not gain the town without opposition. Two battalions of the Scottish troops, in the pay of the states-general, were assembled in the market-place, and attacked them with such fury, that they were driven from street to street, until fresh reinforcements arriving, compelled the Scots to retreat in their turn: yet, they disputed every inch of ground, and fought until two thirds of them were killed upon the spot. Then they brought off the old governor, abandon∣ing
<PB N="691" REF="6940"/>
the town to the enemy: while the troops that were encamped in the lines retreating with great precipitation, all the forts in the neighbourhood imme∣diately surrendered to the victors, who now became masters of the whole navi∣gation of the Schelde. The French king was no sooner informed of Lowen∣dahl's success, than he promoted him to the rank of marechal of France, ap∣pointed count Saxe governor of the conquered Netherlands, and returned in triumph to Versailles. In a little time after this transaction, both armies were distributed into winter-quarters, and the duke of Cumberland embarked for England.</P>

<P>In Italy the French arms did not triumph with equal success, though the marechal de Belleisle saw himself at the head of a powerful army in Provence. In April he passed the Var without opposition, and took posses∣sion of Nice. He met with little or no resistance in reducing Montalban, Villa∣franca, and Ventimiglia; while general Brown, with eight and twenty thousand Austrians, retired towards Final and Savona. In the mean time, another large body under count Schuylemberg, who had succeeded the marquis de Botta, co∣operated with fifteen thousand Piedmontese in an attempt to recover the city of Genoa. The French king had sent thither supplies, succours, and engineers, with the duke de Boufflers as ambassador to the republic, who likewise acted as commander in chief of the forces employed for its defence. The Austrian general assembled his troops in the Milanese: having forced the passage of the Bochetta on the thirteenth of January, he advanced into the territories of Genoa, and the Riviera was ravaged without mercy. On the last day of March he appeared before the city at the head of forty thousand men, and summoned the revolters to lay down their arms. The answer he received was, that the republic had fifty-four thousand men in arms, two hundred and sixty cannon, thirty-four mortars, with abundance of ammunition and provision: that they would defend their liberty with their last blood, and be buried in the ruins of their capital, rather than submit to the clemency of the court of Vienna, except by an honourable capitulation guarantied by the kings of Great-Britain and Sardinia, the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces. In the beginning of May, Genoa was invested on all sides: a furious sally was made by the duke de Boufflers, who drove the besiegers from their posts; but the Austrians ral∣lying, he was repulsed in his turn, with the loss of seven hundred men. General Schuylemberg carried on his operations with such skill, vigour, and intrepidity, that he made himself master of the suburbs of Bisagno; and in all probability would have reduced the city, had not he been obliged to desist, in consequence of the repeated remonstrances made by the king of Sardinia and count Brown, who represented the necessity of his abandoning his enterprize, and drawing off his army, to cover Piedmont and Lombardy from the efforts of marechal de Belleisle. Accordingly he raised the siege on the tenth day of June, and returned into the Milanese, in order to join his Satdinian majesty; while the Genoese made an irruption into the Parmesan and Pla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entin, where they committed terrible outrages, in revenge for the mischiefs they had under∣gone.</P>

<P>While the marechal de Belleisle remained at Ventimiglia, his bro∣ther, at the head of four and thirty thousand French and Spaniards, attempted to penetrate into Piedmont: on the sixth day of July he arrived at the pass of
<PB N="692" REF="6950"/>
E<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illes, a strong fortress on the frontiers of Dauphiné, situated on the north side of the river Doria. The defence of this important post the king of Sar∣dinia had committed to the care of the count de Brigueras, who formed an encampment behind the lines with fourteen battalions of Piedmontese and Austrians, while divers detachments were posted along all the passes of the Alps. On the eighth day of the month the Piedmontese intrenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ments were attacked by the chevalier de Belleisle, with incredible intrepidity; but the columns were repulsed with great loss in three successive attacks. Impatient of this obstinate opposition, and determined not to survive a miscarriage, this impetuous general seized a pair of colours, and advancing at the head of his troops, through a prodigious fire, pitched them with his own hand on the ene∣my's intrenchments. At that instant he fell dead, having received two musket∣balls and the thrust of a bayonet in his body. The assailants were so much dispirited by the death of their commander, that they forthwith gave way, and retreated with precipitation towards Sestrieres, having lost near five thousand men in the attack. The marechal was no sooner informed of his brother's misfortune than he retreated towards the Var, to join the troops from Exilles: while the king of Sardinia, having assembled an army of seventy thousand men, threatened Dauphiné with an invasion; but the excessive rains prevented the execution of his design. General Leutrum was detached with twenty battalions to drive the French from Ventimiglia; but, Belleisle marching back, that scheme was likewise frustrated: and thus ended the campaign.</P>

<DIV4 N="25" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>§ XXV.</HEAD>
<P>In this manner was the French king baffled in his projects upon Italy; nor was he more fortunate in his naval operations. He had, in the preceding year, equipped an expensive armament under the command of the duke d'Anville, for the recovery of Cape Breton; but it was rendered ineffec∣tual by storms, distempers, and the death of the commander. Not yet dis∣couraged by these disasters, he resolved to renew his efforts against the British colonies in North-America, and their settlements in the East-Indies. For these purposes two squadrons were prepared at Brest, one to be commanded by the commodore De la Jonquiere; and the other, destined for India, by monsieur de St. George. The ministry of Great-Britain, being apprized of these measures, resolved to intercept both squadrons, which were to set sail <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ogether. For this purpose vice-admiral Anson and rear-admiral Warren took their departure from Plymouth with a formidable fleet, and steered their course to Cape Finisterre on the coast of Gallicia. On the third day of May they fell in with the French squadrons commanded by La Jonquiere and St. George, consisting of six large ships of war, as many frigates, and four armed vessels equipped by their East-India company, having under their convoy about thirty ships laden with merchandize. Those prepared for war immediately shortened sail, and formed a line of battle; while the rest, under the pro∣tection of the six frigates, proceeded on their voyage with all the sail they could carry. The British squadron was likewise drawn up in line of battle: but Mr. Warren perceiving that the enemy began to sheer off, now their convoy was at a considerable distance, advised admiral Anson to haul in the signal for the line, and hoist another for giving chace and engaging, otherwise the French would in all probability escape by favour of the night. The proposal was embraced; and in a little time the engagement began with great fury, about
<PB N="693" REF="6960"/>
four o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy sustained the battle with equal con∣duct and valour, until they were overpowered by numbers, and then they struck their colours. The admiral detached three ships in pursuit of the con∣voy, nine sail of which were taken; but the rest were saved by the intervening darkness. About seven hundred of the French were killed and wounded in this action. The English lost about five hundred; and among these, captain Grenville, commander of the ship Defiance. He was nephew to the lord vis∣count Cobham, a youth of the most amiable character and promising genius, animated with the noblest sentiments of honour and patriotism. Eager in the pursuit of glory, he rushed into the midst of the battle, where both his legs were cut off by a cannon-ball. He submitted to his fate with the most heroic resignation, and died universally lamented and beloved. The success of the British arms, in this engagement, was chiefly owing to the conduct, activity, and courage of the rear-admiral. A considerable quantity of bullion was found in the prizes, which were brought to Spithead in triumph; and the treasure being landed, was conveyed in twenty waggons to the bank of London. Admiral Anson was ennobled, and Mr. Warren honoured with the order of the Bath.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXVI.</HEAD>
<P>About the middle of June, commodore Fox with six ships of war cruising in the latitude of Cape Ortegal in Gallicia, took above forty French ships richly laden from St. Domingo, after they had been abandoned by their convoy. But the French king sustained another more important loss at sea, in the month of October. Rear-admiral Hawke sailed from Plymouth in the beginning of August, with fourteen ships of the line, to intercept a fleet of French merchant-ships bound for the West-Indies. He cruised for some time on the coast of Brittany; and at length the French fleet sailed from the isle of Aix, under convoy of nine ships of the line, besides frigates, commanded by monsieur de Letenduer. On the fourteenth day of October the two squadrons were in sight of each other, in the latitude of Belleisle. The French commo∣dore immediately ordered one of his great ships and the frigates to proceed with the trading ships, while he formed the line of battle and waited the attack. At eleven in the forenoon admiral Hawke displayed the signal to chace, and in half an hour both fleets were engaged. The battle lasted till night, when all the French squadron, except the Intrepide and Tonant, had struck to the English flag. These two capital ships escaped in the dark, and returned to Brest in a shattered condition. The French captains sustained the unequal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght with uncommon bravery and resolution, and did not yield until their ships were disabled. Their loss in men amounted to eight hundred: the number of English killed in this engagement did not exceed two hundred, including captain Saumarez, a gallant officer, who had served under lord Anson in his expedition to the Pacific Ocean. Indeed, it must be owned, for the honour of that nobleman, that all the officers formed under his example, and raised by his influence, approved themselves in all respects worthy of the com∣mands to which they were preferred. Immediately after the action, admiral Hawke dispatched a sloop to commodore Legge, whose squadron was stationed at the Leeward Islands, with intelligence of the French fleet of merchant∣ships, outward bound, that he might take the proper measures for intercepting them in their passage to Martinique, and the other French islands. In conse∣quence
<PB N="694" REF="6970"/>
of this advice, he redoubled his vigilance, and a good number of them fell into his hands. Admiral Hawke conducted his prizes to Spithead: and in his letter to the board of admiralty declared, that all his captains behaved like men of honour during the engagement, except Mr. Fox, whose conduct he desired might be subjected to an inquiry. That gentleman was accordingly tried by a court-martial, and suspended from his command, for having fol∣lowed the advice of his officers, contrary to his own better judgment: but he was soon restored, and afterwards promoted to the rank of admiral; while Mr Matthews, whose courage never incurred suspicion, still laboured under a suspension, for that which had been successfully practised in both these late engagements, namely, engaging the enemy without any regard to the line of battle.</P>

<P>In the Mediterranean vice-admiral Medley blocked up the Spa∣nish squadron in Carthagena; assisted the Austrian general on the coast of Villafranca; and intercepted some of the succours sent from France to the assistance of the Genoese. At his death, which happened in the beginning of August, the command of that squadron devolved upon rear-admiral Byng, who proceeded on the same plan of operation. In the summer, two British ships of war, having under their convoy a fleet of merchant ships bound to North America, fell in with the Glorioso, a Spanish ship of eighty guns, in the latitude of the Western Isles. She had sailed from the Havannah, with an im∣mense treasure on board, and must have fallen a prize to the English ships, had each captain done his duty. Captain Erskine in the Warwick of sixty guns, attacked her with great intrepidity, and fought until his ship was entirely disabled: but being unsustained by his consort, he was obliged to haul off, and the Glorioso arrived in safety at Ferrol; there the silver was landed, and she proceeded on her voyage to Cadiz, which, however, she did not reach. She was encountered by the Dartmouth, a British frigate of forty guns, commanded by captain Hamilton, a gallant youth, who, notwithstanding the inequality of force, engaged her without hesitation: but, in the heat of the action, his ship being set on fire by accident, was blown up, and he perished with all his crew, except a midshipman and ten or eleven sailors, who were taken up alive by a privateer that happened to be in sight. Favourable as this accident may seem to the Glorioso, she did not escape. An English ship of eighty guns, under the command of captain Buckle, came up, and obliged the Spaniards to surrender, after a short, but vigorous engagement. Commodore Griffin had been sent with a reinforcement of ships, to assume the command of the squadron in the East-Indies; and although his arrival secured Fort St. David's, and the other British settlements in that country, from the insults of monsieur de la Bourdon∣nais, his strength was not sufficient to enable him to undertake any enterprize of importance against the enemy: the ministry of England therefore resolved to equip a fresh armament, that when joined by the ships in India, should be in a condition to besiege Pondicherry, the principal settlement belonging to the French on the coast of Coromandel. For this service, a good number of in∣dependent companies was raised, and set sail, in the sequel, with a strong squa∣dron under the conduct of rear-admiral Boscawen, an officer of unquestioned valour and capacity. In the course of this year, the British cruisers were so alert and successful, that they took six hundred and forty-four prizes from the
<PB N="695" REF="6980"/>
French and Spaniards, whereas the loss of Great-Britain, in the same time, did not exceed five hundred and fifty.</P>

<P>All the belligerant powers were, by this time, heartily tired of a war which had consumed an immensity of treasure, had been productive of so much mischief, and in the events of which, all in their turns, had found themselves disappointed. Immediately after the battle of Lasseldt, the king of France had, in a personal conversation with Sir John Ligonier, expressed his desire of a pacification; and afterwards his minister at the Hague presented a declaration on the same subject, to the deputies of the states-general. The signal success of the British arms at sea, confirmed him in these sentiments, which were likewise reinforced by a variety of other considerations. His finances were almost exhausted, and his supplies from the Spanish West-Indies, rendered so precarious by the vigilance of the British cruisers, that he could no longer depend upon their arrival. The trading part of his subjects had sustained such losses, that his kingdom was filled with bankruptcies; and the best part of his navy now contributed to strengthen the fleets of his enemies. The election of a stadtholder had united the whole power of the states-general against him, in taking the most resolute measures for their own safety: his views in Germany were entirely frustrated by the elevation of the grand duke to the Imperial throne, and the re-establishment of peace between the houses of Austria and Brandenburgh: the success of his arms in Italy, had not at all answered his ex∣pectation: and Genoa was become an expensive ally He had the mortification to see the commerce of Britain flourish in the midst of war, while his own people were utterly impoverished. The parliament of England granted, and the nation payed, such incredible sums as enabled their sovereign, not only to maintain invin∣cible navies and formidable armies, but likewise to give subsidies to all the powers of Europe. He knew that a treaty of this kind was actually upon the anvil between his Britannic majesty and the Czarina, and he began to be apprehensive of seeing an army of Russians in the Netherlands. His fears from this quar∣ter were not without foundation. In the month of November, the earl of Hyndford, ambassador from the king of Great-Britain at the court of Russia, concluded a treaty of subsidy, by which the Czarina engaged to hold in readiness thirty thousand men, and forty gallies, to be employed in the service of the confederates, on the first requisition. The states-general acceded to this agreement, and even consented to pay one-fourth of the subsidy. His most christian majesty, moved by these considerations, made farther advances towards an accommodation both at the Hague and in London; and the contending powers agreed to another congress, which was actually opened in March at Aix∣la-Chapelle, where the earl of Sandwich, and Sir Thomas Robinson, assisted as plenipotentiaries from the king of Great-Britain.</P>

<P>The elections for the new parliament in England, had been con∣ducted so as fully to answer the purposes of the duke of Newcastle, and his brother Mr. Pelham, who had for some time wholly engrossed the administra∣tion. Both houses were assembled on the tenth day of November, when Mr. Onslow was unanimously re elected speaker of the commons. The session was opened, as usual, by a speech from the throne, congratulating them on the signal successes of the British navy, and the happy alteration in the government of the United Provinces. His majesty gave them to understand, that a congress
<PB N="696" REF="6990"/>
would speedily be opened at Aix-la-Chapelle, to concert the means for effecting a general pacification; and reminded them that nothing would more conduce to the success of this negotiation than the vigour and unanimity of their proceedings. He received such addresses as the ministers were pleased to dictate. Opposition now languished at their feet. The duke of Bedford was become a courtier, and in a little time appointed secretary of state, in the room of the earl of Chesterfield, who had lately executed that office which he now resigned; and the earl of Sandwich no longer harrangued against the ad∣ministration. This new house of commons, in imitation of the liberality of their predecessors, rea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy gratified all the requests of the government. They voted forty thousand seamen, forty-nine thousand land-forces, besides eleven thousand five hundred marines; the subsidies for the queen of Hungary, the czarina, the king of Sardinia, the electors of Mentz and Bavaria, the Hessians, and the duke of Wolfembuttle: the sum of two hundred thirty-five thousand seven hundred and forty-nine pounds, was granted to the provinces of New England, to re imburse them for the expence of reducing Cape-Breton; five hundred thousand pounds were given to his majesty for the vigorous prosecution of the war; and about one hundred and fifty two thousand pounds to the Scottish claimants, in lieu of their jurisdiction. The supplies for the ensuing year fell very little short of nine millions, of which the greater part was raised on a loan by subscription, chargeable on a new subsidy of poundage, exacted from all merchandize imported into Great-Britain. Immediately after the rebellion was suppressed, the legislature had established some regulations in Scotland, which were thought necessary to prevent such commotions for the future. The Highlanders were disarmed, and an act passed, for abolishing their peculiarity of garb, which was supposed to keep up party-distinctons, to encourage their martial disposition, and preserve the memory of the exploits atchieved by their ancestors. In this session a bill was brought in to enforce the execution of that law, and passed with another act, for the more effectual punishment of high treason in the Highlands of Scotland. The practice of insuring French and Spanish ships at London, being deemed the sole circumstance that prevented a total stagna∣tion of commerce in those countries, it was prohibited by law under severe penalties; and this step of the British parliament, accelerated the conclusion of the treaty. Several other prudent measures were taken in the course of this session, for the benefit of the public; and among these, we may reckon an act for encouraging the manufacture of indigo in the British plantations of North America; an article for which Great-Britain used to pay two hundred thousand pounds yearly to the subjects of France. The session was closed on the thir∣teenth<NOTE PLACE="marg">A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</NOTE> day of May, when the king declared to both houses, that the prelimi∣naries of a general peace were actually signed at Aix-la-Chapelle by the mi∣nisters of Great-Britain, France, and the United-Provinces; and that the basis of this accommodation was a general restitution of the conquests which had been made during the war. Immediately after the prorogation of parliament, his majesty set out for his German dominions, after having appointed a regency to rule the realm in his absence.</P>

<P>The articles might have been much less unfavourable to Great-Britain and her allies, had the ministry made a proper use of the treaty with the czarina; and if the confederates had acted with more vigour and expedition
<PB N="697" REF="7000"/>
in the beginning of the campaign. The Russian auxiliaries might have been transported by sea to Lubeck, before the end of the preceding summer, in their own gallies which had been lying ready for use since the month of July. Had this expedient been used, the Russian troops might have joined the confederate army before the conclusion of the last campaign. But this easy and expeditious me∣thod of conveyance was rejected for a march by land, of incredible length and difficulty, which could not be begun before the month of January, nor accomplished till Midsummer. The operations of the campaign had been con∣certed at the Hague in January, by the respective ministers of the allies, who resolved to bring an army of one hundred and ninety thousand men into the Netherlands, in order to compel the French to abandon the barrier which they had conquered. The towns of Holland became the scenes of tumult and in∣surrection. The populace plundered the farmers of the revenue, abolished the taxes, and insulted the magistrates; so that the states-general seeing their country on the brink of anarchy and confusion, authorized the prince of Orange to make such alterations as he should see convenient. They presented him with a diploma, by which he was constituted hereditary stadtholder and captain-general of Dutch Brabant, Flanders, and the upper quarter of Guelderland; and the East-India company appointed him director and governor-general of their commerce and settlements in the Indies. Thus invested with an autho∣rity unknown to his ancestors, he exerted himself with equal industry and discretion in new-modelling, augmenting, and assembling the troops of the republic. The confederates knew that the count de S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xe had a design upon Maestricht: the Austrian general Bathiani made repeated remonstrances to the British ministry, intreating them to take speedy measures for the preservations of that fortress. He in the month of January proposed, that the duke of Cumberland should cross the sea, and confer with the prince of Orange on this subject: he undertook, at the peril of his head, to cover Maestricht with seventy thousand men, from all attacks of the enemy: but his representa∣tions seemed to have made very little impression on those to whom they were addressed. The duke of Cumberland did not depart from England till towards the latter end of February: part of March was elapsed, before the transports sailed from the Nore with the additional troops and artillery; and the last draughts from the foot-guards were not embarked till the middle of August.</P>

<P>The different bodies of the confederated forces joined each other, and encamped in the neighbourhood of Ruremonde, to the number of one hun∣dred and ten thousand men; and the French army invested Maestrich<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, with∣out opposition, on the third day of April. The garrison consisted of Imperial and Dutch troops, under the conduct of the governor baron d'Aylva, who defended the place with extraordinary skill and resolution. He annoyed the besiegers in repeated sallies; but they were determined to surmount all oppo∣sition, and prosecuted their approaches with incredible ardour. They assaulted the covered-way, in which they effected a lodgment, after an obstinate dispute, in which they lost two thousand of their best troops; but, next day they were intirely dislodged by the gallantry of the garrison These hostilities were suddenly suspended, in consequence of the preliminaries signed at Aix-la-Chapelle. The plenipotentiaries agreed, that, for the glory of his christian majesty's arms, the town of Maestricht should be surrendered to his general, on condition that is
<PB N="698" REF="7010"/>
should be restored, with all the magazines and artillery. He accordingly took possession of it on the third day of May, when the garrison marched out with all the honours of war; and a cessation of arms immediately ensued. By this time the Russian auxiliaries, to the number of thirty-seven thousand, com∣manded by prince Repnin, had arrived in Moravia, where they were reviewed by their Imperial majesties; then they proceeded to the confines of Franconia, where they were ordered to halt, after they had marched seven hundred miles since the beginning of the year. The French king declared, that should they advance farther, he would demolish the fortifications of Maestricht and Bergen∣op-zoom. This dispute was referred to the plenipotentiaries, who, in the be∣ginning of August, concluded a convention, importing, that the Russian troops should return to their own country; and that the French king should disband an equal number of his forces. The season being far advanced, the Russians were provided with winter-quarters in Bohemia and Moravia, where they continued to the spring, when they marched back to Livonia. In the mean time seven and thirty thousand French troops were withdrawn from Flan∣ders into Picardy, and the two armies remained quiet till the conclusion of the definitive treaty. The suspension of arms was proclaimed at London, and in all the capitals of the contracting powers: orders were sent to the respective admirals in different parts of the world, to refrain from hostilities; and a com∣munication of trade and intelligence was again opened between the nations which had been at variance. No material transaction distinguished the cam∣paign in Italy. The French and Spanish troops who had joined the Genoese in the territories of the republic, amounted to thirty thousand men, under the direction of the duke de Richelieu, who was sent from France to assume that command, on the death of the duke de Boufflers; while marechal de Belleisle, at the head of fifty thousand men, covered the western Riviera, which was threat∣ened with an invasion by forty thousand Austrians and Piedmontese, under ge∣neral Leutrum. At the same time general Brown, with a more numerous army, prepared to re-enter the eastern Riviera, and re-commence the siege of Genoa. But these intended operations were prevented by an armistice, which took place as soon as the belligerant powers had acceded to the preliminaries.</P>

<P>In the East-Indies, rear-admiral Boscawen undertook the siege of Pondicherry, which, in the month of August, he blocked up by sea with his squadron, and invested by land with a small army of four thousand Europeans, and about two thousand natives of that country. He prosecuted the enterprize with great spirit, and took the fort of Area Coupan, at the distance of three miles from the town: then he made his approaches to the place, against which he opened batteries, while it was bombarded and cannonaded by the shipping. But the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortifications were so strong, the garrison so numerous, and the engi∣neers of the enemy so expert in their profession, that he made very little pro∣gress, and sustained considerable damage. At length, his army being diminished by sickness, and the rainy season approaching, he ordered the artillery and stores to be reimbarked; and raising the siege on the sixth day of October, returned to sort St. David, after having lost about a thousand men in this ex∣pedition. In the sequel, several ships of his squadron, and above twelve hun∣dred sailors, perished in a hurricane. The naval force of Great Britain was more successful in the West-Indies. Rear-admiral Knowles, with a squadron
<PB N="699" REF="7020"/>
of eight ships, attacked fort Louis on the south side of Hispaniola, which after a warm action of three hours was surrendered on capitulation, and dismantled. Then he made an abortive attempt upon St. Jago de Cuba, and returned to Jamaica, extremely chagrined at hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> disappointment, which he imputed to the misconduct of captain Dent, who was tried in England by a court-martial, and honourably acquitted. On the first day of October, admiral Knowles cruising in the neighbourhood of the Havannah, with eight ships of the line, encoun∣tered a Spanish squadron of nearly the same strength, under the command of the admirals Reggio and Spinola. The engagement began between two and three o'clock in the afternoon, and continued with intervals till eight in the evening, when the enemy retired to the Havannah, with the loss of two ships; one of which struck to the English admiral, and the other was, two days after, set on fire by her own commander, that she might not fall into the hands of the English. Mr. Knowles taxed some of his captains with misbehaviour, and they recrimi∣nated on his conduct. On their return to England, a court-martial was the consequence of their mutual accusations. Those who adhered to the comman∣der, and the others whom he impeached, were inflamed against other with the most rancorous resentment. The admiral himself did not escape uncensured: two of his captains were reprimanded: but captain Holmes, who had displayed uncommon courage, was honourably acquitted. Their animosities did not end with the court-martial. A bloodless encounter happened between the admiral and captain Powlet: but captain Innes and captain Clarke, meeting by ap∣pointment in Hyde-park wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h pistols, the former was mortally wounded, and died next morning; the latter was tried, and condemned for murder, but in∣dulged with his majesty's pardon. No naval transaction of any consequence happened in the European seas, during the course of this summer. In January indeed, the Magnanime, a French ship of the line, was taken in the channel by two English cruisers, after an obstinate engagement; and the privateers took a considerable number of merchant ships from the enemy.</P>

<HEAD>§ XXXIII.</HEAD>
<P>The plenipotentiaries still continued at Aix-la-chapelle, discus∣sing all the articles of the definitive treaty, which was at length concluded and signed on the seventh day of October. It was founded on former treaties, which were now expresly confirmed, from that of Westphalia to the last concluded at London and Vienna. The contracting parties agreed, That all prisoners on each side should be mutually released, without ransom, and all conquests re∣stored: That the duchies of Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla, should be ceded as a settlement to the infant Don Philip, and the heirs-male of his body; but in case of his ascending the throne of Spain, or of the two Sicilies, or his dying without male-issue, that they should revert to the house of Austria: That the king of Great-Britain should, immediately after the ratification of this treaty, send two persons of rank and distinction, to reside in France, as hostages, until restitution should be made of Cape-Breton, and all the other conquests which his Britannic majesty should have atchieved in the East or West-Indies, before or after the preliminaries were signed: That the assiento contract, with the ar∣ticle of the annual ship, should be confirmed for four years, during which the enjoyment of that privilege was suspended since the commencement of the present war: That Dunkirk should remain fortified on the land-side, and towards the sea continue on the footing of former treaties. All the con∣tracting
<PB N="700" REF="7030"/>
powers became guaranties to the king of Prussia for the duchy of Silefia and the county of Glatz, as he at present possessed them; and they likewise engaged to secure the empress-queen of Hungary and Bohemia in possession of her hereditary dominions, according to the pragmatic sanction. The other articles regulated the forms and times fixed for this mutual restitu∣tion, as well as for the termination of hostilities in different parts of the world. But the right of English subjects to navigate in the American seas, without being subject to search, was not once mentioned; though this claim was the original source of the differences between Great-Britain and Spain: nor were the limits of Acadia ascertained. This and all other disputes were left to the dis∣cussion of commissaries. We have already observed, that after the troubles of the empire began, the war was no longer maintained on British principles. It be∣came a continental contest, and was prosecuted on the side of the allies, without conduct, spirit, or unanimity. In the Netherlands they were outnumbered and outwitted by the enemy. They never hazarded a battle without sustaining a defeat. Their vast armies, payed by Great-Britain, lay inactive, and beheld one fortress reduced after another, until the whole country was subdued; and as their generals fought, their plenipotentiaries negotiated. At a time, when their affairs began to wear the most promising aspect; when the arrival of the Russian auxiliaries would have secured an undoubted superiority in the field; when the British fleets had trampled on the naval power of France and Spain, intercepted their supplies of treasure, and cut off all their resources of commerce; the British ministers seemed to treat, without the least regard to the honour and advantage of their country. They left her most valuable and necessary rights of trade unowned and undecided: they subscribed to the insolent demand of sending the nobles of the realm to grace the court, and adorn the triumphs of her enemy: and they tamely gave up her conquests in North-America, of more consequence to her traffic than all the other dominions for which the powers at war contended: they gave up the important isle of Cape-Breton, in exchange for a petty factory in the East-Indies, belonging to a private com∣pany, whose existence has been deemed prejudicial to the commonwealth. What then were the fruits which Britain reaped from this long and desperate war? A dreadful expence of blood and treasure, disgrace upon disgrace, an additional load of grievous impositions, and the national debt accumulated to the enor∣mous sum of eighty millions sterling.</P>
