<HEAD>ENGLISH SOVEREIGNS.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE the Romans came into this island, the Britons, who then possessed the country, were divided into several nations, each of them governed by their own kings. And, when Britain became a mem∣ber of the Roman empire, many of their tribes had their proper kings, who were suffered to govern by their own laws, provided they were tributary. Such kings were Cogidunus and Prastitagus, mentioned by Tacitus; Lucius, said to be the first christian king, who died in 407, and left the Roman emperor heir to his kingdom; with Coilus, the father of Helena, mother of Constantine the Great. After the Romans had quitted Britain, upon the irruptions of the Goths into Italy, in the empire of Honorius, that is, in 430, the kingly government returned to the Britons, who chose for their king, Constantine, brother of Aldroi∣nus, king of Brittany, in France, a prince of the British blood; to whom succeeded Constantine his son; then Vortiger, who usurped the crown; but being harassed by the Scots and Picts in 440, and to maintain his usurpation, first called in the Saxons, at that time hovering along the coast of Britain, in 446
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
These having got sure footing in the island, never left the Britons quiet till they were in possession of the whole. And though they were overthrown in many battles by King Vortimer, the son and successor of Vortiger, and afterwards by King Arthur, yet the Britons were, soon after his death, so broken and weakened, that they were forced at last to retreat, and exchange this sweet and rich part of Britain for the mountains of Wales. Cadwallader, last king of the Britons, began to reign 660, killed in battle Lothair, king of Kent; and Ethelwold, king of the West Saxons, turned monk and died at Rome.— Thus the Britons left the stage, and the Saxons en∣tered. By these the country was divided into seven kingdoms, called the Heptarchy. Kent, the first kingdom, was in Julius Caesar's time, the sovereignty of four petty princes, and never called a kingdom, till Hengist erected it into one.</P>

<P>This kingdom began 534, ended 829, having con∣tinued 295 years. Its first christian king was Kingils.</P>
<P>The Saxons, though they were divided into seven kingdoms, were for the most part subject unto only one monarch, who was stiled King of the English nation; the most powerful giving the law unto the others.</P>
<P>HENGIST, first monarch of Britain, landed in the isle of Thanet, 449; and, after having surprized Vortiger, and put to death a great number of the Britons, took possession of his dominions, and laid the foundation of the monarchy. He bore in his standard the white horse, blazoned in the same manner as borne by the Dukes of Brunswick. He was born at Angria, in Westphalia, and left behind him two sons and a daughter, having reigned 34 years, died 484.</P>
<P>ELLA, 2d monarch, sent for by Hengist, in the 23d year of his reign, brought with him a supply of Saxons, and landed at Shoreham, in Sussex. He continued in Britain five years, harassing the na∣tives, before he assumed the title of King of the
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
South Saxons, which he governed for six years before the death of Hengist, whom he succeeded, as the second monarch. He had three sons; the eldest died before his father, and the youngest suc∣ceeded him in the kingdom of the South Saxons. Ella reigned 26 years, died 499.</P>
<P>CHERDIC, 3d monarch, arrived in Britain, and overcame a British sovereign, called Natanleod, near Chard, in Hampshire, in the 7th year of Ella's monarchy; and, about 6 years after, began the kingdom of the West Saxons, where he reigned 13 years, when he assumed the monarchy, which he continued for the space of 21 years; and, having two sons, died in 534, the 33d of his kingdom, and the 40th after his arrival.</P>
<P>KRNRIKE, 2d king of the West Saxons, 4th monarch, the eldest son of Cherdic, succeeded in his domini∣ons in 534. He twice defeated the Britons in the 32d year of his age. He reigned 26 years, and died in 560. He left three sons.</P>
<P>CHEVLINE, 3d king of the West Saxons, and 5th monarch, succeeded his father in both his dignities, and enlarged his kingdom of the West Saxons; but, treating his subjects with contempt, he was by them compelled to abdicate his throne, in the 33d year of his reign, and died in banishment, in 592. He had two sons.</P>
<P>ETHELBERT, 5th king of Kent, and 6th monarch, began to reign 561, when St. Augustine first ar∣rived in his dominions, who, with his followers, were entertained by this king at Canterbury, where they settled, and to whose doctrine Ethelbert be∣came a convert, and gave Canterbury to the use of the Augustines. He also gave Augustine an idol temple without the walls of the city, as a burial place for him and his successors, which was con∣verted
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
into a monastery. This king was the first that caused the laws of the land to be collected, and translated into Saxon. He died Feb. 24, 616, the 21st of his christianity, the 23d of his monarchy, and the 56th of his reign over Kent, and was bu∣ried at Canterbury. His first wife was the daugh∣ter of Chilperike, king of France, by whom he had three children, a son and two daughters. He had a second wife, whose name has not been transmit∣ted to us, being unworthy of remembrance, for marrying her son-in-law after the death of his father. Pope Boniface presented Ethelbert's eldest daughter, Ethelburge, with a looking-glass, and an ivory comb (which was preserved in Sir Robt. Cotton's collection) to induce her to be married to Edwin, king of Northumberland.</P>
<P>REDWALD, 3d king of the East Angles, became 7th monarch, about 616, and in the 24th of his reign over the East Angles; who, in the second year of his reign, had established Edwin in Northumber∣land. He died in the 8th year of his monarchy, and the 31st year of his reign over the East Angles, 624. He had two sons.</P>
<P>EDWIN the Great, king of Northumberland, succeed∣ed Redwald, as 8th monarch, in 624. He was the first Christian and the second King of Nor∣thumberland. He received baptism the 12th of April, in the 11th year of his reign, 627, about 180 after the arrival of the Saxons. He lost his life in a battle, Oct. 4, 633, in the 6th of his Chris∣tianity, the 7th of his monarchy, and the 47th year of his age. His body was buried at Whitby, in Yorkshire. He had four sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>OSWALD, 3d King of Northumberland, 9th monarch, in 634, erected a cross of wood, which is said, by Bede, to be the first altar to Christ among the Bornicians. He was slain at Mascifield, in Shrop∣shire,
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
Aug. 1, 642, the 9th year of his reign, and the 38th of his age. He married Kineburg, daugh∣ter of Kingils, the first christian king of the West Saxons, by whom he had a son.</P>
<P>OSWY, 4th king of Northumberland, became 10th monarch, in 642, on Oct. 13. He defeated Pen∣da, the Mercian, and Ethelred, king of the East Angles, Nov. 6, 655, and reigned with glory 33 years. He it was that decided the long contro∣versy for the celebration of Easter. He died Feb. 15, 670, having reigned as monarch 28 years. His wife was the daughter of Edwin of Northum∣berland, by whom he had two sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>VULFHERE, 6th king of the Mercians, became 11th monarch in 670; began in Mercia in 659, and reigned over them 17 years, and Britain 4, died 674, and was buried at Peterborough. He married the daughter of Ercombert of Kent, by whom he had three sons and a daughter.</P>
<P>ETHELRED, 7th king of Mercia, and 12th monarch, succeeded his brother Vulfhere in both dignities, in 675. In the beginning of his reign he desolated part of Kent, and, in 677, destroyed Rochester, and many religious foundations; in recompence for which, he became a monk, and died abbot of Bradney, in the 30th year of his reign, 716. He married the daughter of Oswy of Northumberland, by whom he had a son.</P>
<P>KENRED, his nephew, 8th king of Mercia, and 13th monarch, succeeded him in 704, reigned in peace 4 years, and then, following his uncle's example, became a monk. In his reign Pope Constantine ordained the adoration of images to commemo∣rate saints.</P>
<P>CHELDRED, son to Ethelred, 9th king of the Mer∣cians,
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
and 14th monarch, in 709, was killed in battle with the West Saxons, after a reign of seven years, 716; died without children, and was buri∣ed at Litchfield.</P>
<P>ETHELBALD I. 10th king of the Mercians, became 15th monarch, in 716. The beginning of his reign was debauched; but he reformed, on being ad∣monished by Cuthbert of Canterbury, and, for atonement, built Croy-land abbey, in Lincolnshire. In the 30th year of his reign, it was enacted, that the Scriptures should be read in monasteries, and the Lord's Prayer and Creed taught in the Saxon tongue. In the 40th year of his reign, he was slain by his own subjects, when he was leading his troops against Cuthred, the West Saxon, at Secon∣dine, three miles from Tamworth, in Warwick∣shire, and was buried at Repton, in Derbyshire, in 750, leaving neither wife nor child.</P>
<P>OFFA, the 11th king of the Mercians, and 16th mo∣narch. He was born lame, deaf, and blind, which continued till he arrived to manhood, when the Mercian nobles received him for their king, and he began his reign with great prospect of glory. He took up arms against Kent, slew their king at Otterford, and conquered that kingdom. He made great havock beyond the Humber, whence returning triumphant, he went against the West Saxons. He caused a great trench to be dug from Bristol to Basingwerk, in Flintshire, as the boun∣dary of the Britons who harboured in Wales in 774; which the Welch endeavoured to destroy, but were repulsed with great loss. The ledger-book of St. Alban's says, Offa first ordained the sounding of trumpets before the kings of England, to denote their appearance, and require respect. He repulsed the Danes to their great loss. He ad∣mitted his son Egfryd, a partner in his sovereignty,
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
and, out of devotion, paid a visit to Rome, where he made his kingdom subject to a tribute, then called Peter-pence, and procured the canoniza∣tion of St. Alban. At his return he built St. Alban's monastry, in Hertfordshire, 793. He died at Offley, June 29, 794, in the 39th year of his reign, and was buried at Bedford, in a chapel, since swallowed up by the river Ouse. He had issue by his queen, one son and three daughters.</P>
<P>EGFRYD, 12th king of the Mercians, and 17th mo∣narch, succeeded his father in both dignities, July 13, 794, but died Dec. 17 following, and was buried at St. Alban's, leaving neither wife nor child.</P>
<P>KENWOLF, 13th king of the Mercians, and 18th Monarch, succeeded Egfryd in 795. He was an example of piety, and impartially administered jus∣tice. He conquered Kent, gave that kingdom to Cuthred, and kept their king Pren captive in Mer∣cia. He built Winchcomb monastery in Gloucester∣shire, where he led Pren to the altar, and released him without ransom or entreaty. He died in 819, the 22d year of his reign, and was buried at Winch∣comb. He left one son and two daughters.</P>
<P>EGBERT, 17th king of the West Saxons, and 19th but first sole monarch of the English. He began his reign over the West Saxons in 800. The Cornish and Welch associated against him, which provoked him to enact a law, commanding no Briton to presume to pass Offa's ditch, and immediate death to his enemies that durst set foot upon English ground. He took Chester, and caused their broken image of Cadwallo to be thrown down from the western gate of London. He conquered Mercia, and laid the foundation of the sole monarchy in 819, which put an end to the Saxon Heptarchy, and was so∣lemnly crowned at Winchester, when, by his edict,
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
he ordered all the south of the island to be called England, 820. He repulsed the Danes, and drove them out of England, 836. He died Feb. 4, 836, in the 36th year of his reign over the West Saxons, and 17th of his monarchy, and was buried at Winchester. He left two sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>ETHELWOLF, eldest son of Egbert, succeeded his father, notwithstanding, at the time of Egbert's death, he was bishop of Winchester. He gave his bishopric to Swithin. In 846 he ordained tithes to be collected, and exempted the clergy from re∣gal tributes He visited Rome in 847, confirming the grant of Peter-pence, and agreed to pay Rome 300 marks per ann. His son, Ethelbald, obliged him to divide the sovereignty with him, 856. He reigned above 20 years, died Jan. 13, 857, and was buried, but removed to Winchester. He had four sons and one daughter.</P>
<P>ETHELBALD II. eldest son of Ethelwolf, succeeded his father in 857, and, notwithstanding he oppo∣sed his father, for honouring the emperor Charles's daughter with being his queen, after his death, contrary to all laws, took her for his own wife. He died Dec. 20, 860, and was buried at Sher∣born, but removed to Salisbury.</P>
<P>ETHELBERT II. second son of Ethelwolf, succeeded his brother in 860, and was harassed greatly by the Danes, who were repulsed and vanquished. He died in 866, and was succeeded by</P>
<P>ETHELRED, his brother, third son of Ethelwolf, in 866, when the Danes again harassed his kingdom; in 870, they destroyed the monasteries of Bradney, Crowland, Peterborough, Ely, and Huntingdon, when the nuns of Coldingham defaced themselves to avoid their pollution; and, in East Anglia, they murdered Edmund, at Edmundsbury, in Suffolk.
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
Ethelred overthrew the Danes, 871, at Assendon, which was the greatest loss the Danes had ever met with in England. He had nine set battles with the Danes in one year, and was wounded at Wit∣tingham, which occasioned his death, April 27, 872, and was buried at Winborne, in Dorsetshire. He had two sons and one daugher.</P>
<P>ALFRED, the fourth son of Ethelwolf, succeeded his brother in 872, in the 22d year of his age, was crowned at Winchester, and is distinguished by the title of Alfred the Great. He was born at Wantage, in Berkshire, 849, and obliged to take the field of battle against the Danes, within one month after his coronation, at Wilton, in Oxford∣shire. In the 4th year of his reign they divided their army, one part seized on Exeter, where they wintered, and the other went into Northumber∣land. Alfred defeated them at Exeter, but they again made head against him at Chippenham, in 876, where he was defeated, and again soon after at Bristol; but he recovered strength, and attacked them in camp, at Abingdon, in Oxfordshire. He fought seven battles with them the same year. In 877, another succour of Danes arrived, and Al∣fred was obliged to disguise himself in the habit of a shepherd, in the isle of Aldersey, in the coun∣ty of Somerset, till he, in a still further disguise of a musician, in 878, discovered the Danes' careless way of living, and, collecting his scattered friends, attacked and defeated them, in 879, when he o∣bliged them to receive baptism, and the greatest part of their army to quit the land. In 885 they returned, but were repulsed in 889. However, in 892, they again arrived, with 250 ships, and harassed the land. In 897 they came up the Thames, and, by some small boats, went up the rive Lea, and built a fortress at Wear, when king
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
Alfred turned off the course of the river, and left the ships dry, which obliged the Danes to remove. He died Oct. 28, 901, in the 30th year of his reign. The same year he died, he formed a body of laws, afterwards made use of by Edward the Confessor, and was the ground-work of the pre∣sent. He divided his kingdom into shires, hun∣dreds and tithings; and obliged his nobles to bring up their children to learning, and to induce them thereto, permitted none into office unless they were learned; and, to enable them to procure that learning, he founded the university of Oxford. He was buried at Winchester, and had two sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>EDWARD the Elder, his son, succeeded him, and was crowned at Kingston upon Thames, in 901. The kingdom was greatly harassed by the Danes on his accession; but, in 910, two Danish chiefs were slain at Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire, which stopped their ravages. In 911 Leolin, Prince of Wales, did homage to Edward for his principality. He died at Farringdon, in Berkshire, in 924, the 24th year of his reign, and was buried at Winchester. He had by his first Queen two sons and a daughter, by his second Queen two sons and five daughters, and by his last Queen two sons and two daughters.</P>
<P>ATHELSTAN, his eldest son, succeeded him, and was crowned with far greater magnificence than usual, at Kingston upon Thames, in 924. In 937 he defeated two Welch princes, but soon after, on their making submission, he restored them their estates. He escaped being assassinated in his tent, 938, which he revenged by attacking his enemy, when five petty sovereigns, 12 dukes, and an army who came to the assistance of Anlaf, King of Ire∣land, were stain; which battle was fought near
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
Dunbar in Scotland. He made the Princes of Wales tributaty, 941; and the year before caused the Scriptures to be translated into Saxon. He died, without issue, Oct. 17, 940, at Gloucester, having reigned 15 years and odd months.</P>
<P>EDMUND I. the 5th son of Edward the Elder, suc∣ceeded him, who, at the age of 18, was crowned king at Kingston upon Thames in 940, whose reign was disturbed by Anlaf, King of Ireland. On May 26, 946, in endeavouring to part two of his servants, who were quarrelling, he received a wound, by which he bled to death, having reigned 5 years and 7 months, and was buried at Glastonbury. He had issue two sons.</P>
<P>EDRED, his brother, aged 23, succeeded him, in the year 946, and was crowned at Kingston upon Thames the 17th of August. A rebellion broke out in the North, which he suppressed, and burnt the monastery of Ripon. He died in the 10th year of his reign, 955, and was buried at Win∣chester. He left two sons.</P>
<P>EDWY, eldest son of Edmund, succeeded Edred, and was crowned at Kingston upon Thames, in 955. He had great dissentions with the clergy, and ba∣nished Dunstan, their ringleader, which occasions little credit to be given of the character the priests give him. He died of grief in 959, after a tur∣bulent reign of 4 years, and was buried at Win∣chester. He had no children.</P>
<P>EDGAR, at the age of 16, succeeded his brother, and was crowned at Kingston upon Thames in 959, and again at Bath in 972. He expelled married priests, and gave the guidance of his affairs to Archbishop Dunstan. Among other laws, he en∣acted one to suppress excessive drinking, ordaining a size by pins in the cup, with penalties to any who should presume to drink deeper than the
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
mark; and imposed on the Prince of Wales a tribute of wolves heads, that for three years a∣mounted to 300 each year, which extirpated them, when the tribute ceased. He obliged 8 tributary princes to row him in a barge on the river Dee, in 961. So great was his naval power, as to em∣ploy 3600 ships to secure the coast from pirates. He reigned in peace above 16 years, died July 8, 973, in the 37th year of his age, and was buried at Glastonbury. He had one son by his first Queen, and two by his second.</P>
<P>EDWARD, surnamed the Martyr, his eldest son, suc∣ceeded him, being but 16 years of age, was crown∣ed by Dunstan at Kingston upon Thames in 973. He was stabbed by the private instructions of his mother-in-law, as he was drinking a cup of wine, when he called to see her and his half-brother, at Corfe-castle, in the isle of Purbeck, in Dorsetshire, on May 18, 979, in the 4th year of his reign. He was buried at Wareham, without any ceremo∣ny, but removed three years after, in great pomp, to Shaftesbury.</P>
<P>ETHELRED II. succeeded his half-brother, and was crowned at Kingston upon Thames, 979. The Danes, in the second year of his reign, arrived with 7 ships upon the coast of Kent, and landed on the isle of Thanet. In 981 they again entered the British seas. In 982 his palace, with great part of London, was destroyed by fire, after which succeeded a great mortality. In 989 and 991, the Danes invaded his kingdom, but were restrained from further mischief, by Ethelred pay∣ing them 10,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to desist and depart. Notwith∣standing they then departed, so great an emolu∣ment excited them to commence hostilities soon after, and they made frequent invasions in 993, 995, 996, 998, and 999, received at one pay∣ment
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
about 16,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> raised by a land-tax called Danegelt; and the Danes grew so imperious as to acquire the title of Lord-Danes, which induced Ethelred to order a general massacre of the Danes on Nov. 13, 1002. This exasperated the Danes, and excited them to revenge their countrymen's deaths; for which purpose Sweyn landed on the coast of Devon in 1003, and on the coast of Nor∣folk the year following, when he destroyed the city of Norwich and the town of Thetford; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> did he quit the kingdom till Ethelred had paid him 36,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> which he, the year following, de∣manded as an annual tribute. To enforce the payment of this demand, he sent a fleet, to op∣pose which, in 1007, Ethelred fitted out a fleet much larger than any ever possessed by his prede∣cessors; but, by the dissentions of the nobility, was rendered useless; and the Danes pillaged Kent, and secured their winter-quarters in the isle of Thanet. In the spring of 1008, they subdued great part of the kingdom, pillaging wherever they went. To stop their progress, it was agreed to pay the Danes 48,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> to quit the kingdom, 1012. Soon after Sweyn entered the Humber again, threatening desolation, which so intimidated Ethelred, that he retired to the isle of Wight, and sent his sons, with their mother Emma, into Nor∣mandy, to her brother; and Sweyn took possession of the whole kingdom, 1013.</P>
<P>SWEYN proclaimed King of England in 1014, and no one disputed his title. His first act of sove∣reignty was laying on the people an insupportable tax, which he did not live to see enforced. He was killed by the people at Gainsborough Feb. 2, 1014.</P>
<P>CANUTE, his son, was proclaimed March, 1014, and endeavoured to gain the aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions of his English subjects, but without success.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="54"/>ETHELRED returned at the invitation of his subjects, and Canute left England. This calm was short; for Canute returned, with a fleet of 200 sail, and landed at Sandwich, which occasioned Ethelred to retire to the north; but, by evading a battle with the Danes, he lost the affections of his subjects, and retiring to London, he expired, after a reign of 37 years, 1016. By his first queen he had six sons and four daughters, and by his second two sons.</P>
<P>EDMUND IRONSIDE, his son, was crowned at Kingston upon Thames, April, 1016; but, by a disagreement among the nobility, Canute was like∣wise crowned at Southampton. In June following, they both took the field. Canute totally routed Edmund, at Ashdown, in Essex; after which he met Canute in the isle of Alderncy, in the Severn, where a peace was concluded, and the kingdom divided between them.

<HEAD>SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>THIS nation has as great pretensions to antiquity as any in Europe, having, according to their historians, possessed that kingdom for above 2000 years, without ever being entirely conquered; though they have been subdued at certain periods by the Romans and English, and in a great measure over∣run by the Danes. They boast a line of 115 kings, who can all of them deduce their pedigree from Fer∣gus I. who was sent by the people of Ireland, and came into Scotland about the time that Alexander the Great took Babylon, viz 330 years before Christ. As to the origin of the Scots, there are various opini∣ons, and the historians who contend for their anti∣quity, say they came from Spain. Those are opposed by others who, in general, suppose them to be a re∣mainder of the Britons, who fled from the Roman servitude. However, we shall begin with Metel∣lanus, the 17th King of Scotland, in the second year of whose reign Jesus Christ was born; he died in 29, and was succeeded by Caractacus.</P>

<P>666 Tuda was ordained, and the same year died of the plague, which then raged in Northum∣berland. The see was governed 14 years by Eata, then Abbot of Holy Island, after when time he was made Bishop of the same see, and continued so four years.</P>
<P>685 St. Cuthbert—he was consecrated at York by Theodore, then Archbishop, King Egfrid and seven bishops being present at the consecration, which was upon Easter-day. Upon the de∣cease of St. Cuthbert, the see was governed by</P>

<P>Eadbert, who was bishop 8 years. Then</P>
<P>854 Eardulph—At this time certain Danes and Pa∣gans of divers other nations invaded and de∣stroyed this nation in many parts; and Hal∣dane, king of the Danes, with a great army, arrived in Tinmouth haven, with intent to destroy the county of Northumberland, plun∣dered and destroyed great part of the superb Abbey, at Tinmouth; when the bishop and clergy took the corpse of St. Cuthbert, and fled with it from place to place, without any certain rest, for almost the space of 7 years, to avoid the merciless infidels. The said Ear∣dulph was bishop of Chester above 18 years.</P>
<P>Cutheard was made bishop in his room, who purchased many lands and possessions, and gave them to the Church of St. Cuthbert.</P>

<P>1042 Eadred, a secular priest, and assistant to the former in the government of his diocese, usurped the see, and on the first entering the church as Bishop, was suddenly deprived of the use of his limbs, and lay bed-ridden till the tenth month of his usurpation, when he died.</P>
<P>Egelrick succeeded, he pulled down the church of Chester, which was built with wood, and erected a new one of stone; in digging the foundation he found a great quantity of trea∣sure, which he sent to the monastery of Peter∣borough, and, having resigned the see to his brother,</P>
<P>Egelwin, followed it thither. The see con∣tinued vacant one year, when</P>
<P>1072 Walcher, a secular priest, and of noble paren∣tage, was consecrated at Winchester, and died in the ninth year of his consecration: he bought the government of Northumberland, but oppressed the people with so much extor∣tion, that he became odious to them, and on his going to Gateshead, to settle controversies between certain Northumbrians and his ser∣vants, the people rose upon him there and murdered him, with sundry of his clergy and all his attendants, about 100 in number,</P>
<P>1080 and burnt down the church, where they had fled for sanctuary. The see was vacant 6 months and 10 days, when</P>
<P>1081 William de Carileph, a Monk, was consecra∣ted Bishop, who added several lands for the
<PB N="77" REF="81"/>
emolument of the Monks. This Bishop fell under the displeasure of King William Rufus, who seized the bishoprick and kept it in his own hands for 3 years; but was afterwards, for certain good services, restored to his for∣mer dignity and place. This prelate began to build the present Abbey or Cathedral Church at Durham, but died nine years before it was finished. After a vacancy in the see for 3 years</P>
<P>199 Randulph Flamberd, of the secular order, and chaplain to the king, was consecrated Bishop; he was in such high favour with the king that he made him his treasurer and chancel∣lor; but in the reign of Henry I. he was, for a certain time, banished the realm; in the mean time, the king seized upon the see, and dismembered it of Hexham and Carlisle, which from the days of St. Cuthbert, had been an∣nexed to it; but, for certain political reasons, was again seated in the chair. The see was vacant 5 years, after which</P>
<P>1133 Galfrid Rufus, Lord Chancellor to Henry T. was consecrated. He built the castle at Nor∣thallerton, and died 1140. The see was again vacant 3 years, through the usurpation of William Comyn, a Scottish clerk, but after that time</P>

<P>1207 Durham, and began to coin money. After his decease, the see was vacant 5 years, 10 Months, and 24 days, when</P>

Glass windows began to
<PB N="132" REF="136"/>
be used in private houses in England, 1180; glass was first made into bottles and vessels, 1457; the first glass-plates, for looking-glasses and coach-win∣dows, made at Lambeth, by the encouragement of the Duke of Buckingham, who introduced (from Venice) the manufacturing of fine glass into Eng∣land, 1674.</P>
<P>Sometime in the reign of Queen Elizabeth came over to England, from Lorrain, the Henzels, Tyzacks, and Tytorys. The reason of their coming hither was the persecution of the Protestants in their own country, of whose persuasion they were. They were by occupation Glass-makers. At their first coming to this town they wrought in their trade at the Close-gate, after that they removed into Staf∣fordshire, from whence they removed again, and settled upon the river side, at the place called, from their abiding in it, the Glass-houses. Deservedly, therefore, have so many of these families been named Peregrines from the Latin word <HI>peregrinus</HI> which signifies a pilgrim, or a stranger.</P>
<P>Having at last settled here they became very nume∣rous, and generally married into each others fami∣lies to preserve the three names of Henzel, Tyzack, and Tytory. But the latter of them within these few years became extinct. There are of the Ty∣zacks several remaining; but the Henzels are more numerous.</P>

<P>Tallow-candles were thought so great a luxury in England, that splinters of wood were used for light: they had no idea of wax ones, 1300.</P>
<P>Sedan-chairs were first used in London; a man called Duncombe, was granted a fourteen-years patent for selling them, 1634.</P>
<P>The art of gilding with leaf-gold, on bole-ammoniac, was invented by one Margaritone, 1273.</P>

<P>The first clock-makers that were in England, were three from Delft, 1368.</P>
<P>The first bankers were goldsmiths, whose business was to buy and sell plate, and foreign coins; and at first paid four-pence per cent. per diem, but lent to others at higher interest, 1645.</P>
<P>Gardening introduced into England, from the Ne∣therlands, 1509; musk-melons, and apricots cul∣tivated in England; the pale goose-berry, with salads, garden roots, cabbages, &amp;c. brought from Flanders, and hops from Artois, 1520; damask-rose brought here by Dr. Linaere, physician to Henry VIII. Pippins brought into England by Leonard Mascal, of Plumstead in Sussex, 1525; Currants, or Corinthian grapes first planted in England, 1533, brought from the isle of Zant, belonging to Venice; the musk rose, and several sorts of plumbs from Italy, by Lord Cromwell; ta∣merisk plant, from Germany, by Archbishop Grindal; at and about Norwich the Flemmings first planted flowers unknown in England, as gilly-flowers, carnations, province rose, &amp;c. 1567; woad origi∣nally from Thoulouse in France; tulip roots first brought into England, from Vienna, 1578; aspa∣ragus, artichoaks, oranges, and lemons, introduced into England about this time; cauliflowers somewhat later; also beans, peas, and salads, now in com∣mon use, 1660.</P>

<P>A statute was made, enacting, that a runagate servant, or any, who live idly three days, be brought be∣fore two justices of the peace, and marked V, with a hot iron, on the breast, and adjudged the slave of him who brought him for two years; he shall take the said slave, and give him bread, water, or small-drink, and refuse-meat, and cause him to work, by beating, chaining, or otherwise; and if, within that space, he absent himself 14 days, to be marked on the forehead or cheek, by a hot iron, with an S, and be his master's slave for ever; second deser∣tion felony, when it is lawful to put a ring of iron round his neck, arm, or leg; a beggar's child may be put apprentice, and, on running away, a slave to his master, 1547.</P>

and every lord, knight, and gentleman of 20 marks of land, and their heirs, and such as have borne an office of worship in any city, town, or place, and the wardens of the London companies, 1571.</P>
<P>Time measurer by water introduced by Scip. Nasica, 159. King Alfred's time-keeper was six large wax-tapers, each 12 inches long, and divided into inches; as they burnt unequally, owing to the wind, he invented a lanthorn, made of wood, and then scraped plates of ox horns, glass being then a rarity, 887.—The ancients had three sorts of time measurers, viz. hour-glasses, sun-dials, and a vessel full of water, with a hole in its bottom.</P>
<P>Nero, having a foolish fancy to see a mock-burning of Troy, set Rome on fire, and lays the fault upon the Christians. This was the occasion of the first persecution, which was a dreadful one, 65.</P>
<P>Constantine, who was in Britain at his father's death hastening to Rome against Maxentius the Usurper, as he passed over the Alps, near the town of Au∣tun, there appeared to him a shining cross in the air, with these words, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, which not at first understanding, he was after ad∣monished in a vision to use the cross as a military sign; which he did, and at his arrival at Rome, defeated Maxentius and his mighty army. Where∣upon Constantine openly renounced Paganism, and embraced the Christian religion; and in the 312th year of our Lord, he issued out a proclamation, per∣mitting Christians the open profession of their faith, and to assemble and build temples. The church, whose brightness and purity till then had only shined in the midst of the blood and ashes of her children, assumes a new face, and from the wild desarts where she wandered before, now comes to live in towns, and finds an entertainment even in
<PB N="136" REF="140"/>

<P>Charles the Great, called in French <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> was one of the greatest princes that has lived since the days of Constantine; he was courageous, virtuous, and wise, a great favourer of learned men, and an industrious propagator of Christianity, having dis∣pensed the light of the Gospel in Saxony, and the other northern parts of Germany which he con∣quered. The Boii, or Bavarians, were likewise subjected by him, and the Saracens, Huns, Danes, and Normans felt the power of his sword. Being in peaceable possessions of the kingdoms of France and Germany, he was invited by the Pope into Italy, to redress the injury Desiderius, king of Lom∣bardy, had offered. Him Charles conquered, and added that kingdom to his empire; and finally, by the pope's procurement, at Rome the people saluted him emperor, to which dignity Leo III. crowned him on Christmas-day, 800.</P>
<P>The Turks were masters of Syria, the lesser Asia, and all Palestine, where they very much oppressing the Christians, Simeon, patriarch of Jerusalem, writes to the Pope for relief, who calls a council at Placentia, and obtains a general cruisade for war from all the nations of Christendom, for re∣covery of the Holy-land, to be decreed, 1095 — Great preparations are immediately made for the holy war, and divers princes and noblemen, among whom Godfrey of Bulloigne (duke of Loraine, or rather of Brabant) set forward with a great army, 1096.</P>

<P>Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa, having, partly by his own study in geography, and partly by the information of some seamen who had been driven on some far western coast, conceived an opinion, that there was a large country westward of us, yet unknown, applied himself zealously for the discovery of it; to which purpose he first de∣sired assistance of the state of Genoa, afterwards of our King Henry VII. and of Emanuel, King of Portugal; by all whom being refused, he at length obtained it of Ferdinand and Isabella, king and queen of Spain, who, in the year 1492, gave him three ships, with men and provisions; with these he set out, and happily effected his intention, dis∣covering Cuba and Hispaniola, and returned to Spain, 1493.</P>
<P>Afterwards Americus Vespasius being sent forth by Emanuel, king of Portugal, discovered the southern continent of America; which name he had the ho∣nour to give to all that vast country, 1497.</P>
<P>Mahomet, the false prophet, flies from Mecca to Me∣dina, in Arabia, in the 44th year of his age and 10th of his ministry, when he laid the foundation of the Saracen empire, and from whom the Maho∣metan princes to this day claim their descent.

<P>A party of rebels got together at Alnwick, in Nor∣thumberland; whereupon some troops of dragoons and companies of foot marched immediately to se∣cure Newcastle, where the remembrance of the hardships imposed upon that place by the Scots during the rebellion against King Charles I. armed the inhabitants against every inclination of admit∣ting their northern neighbours, and their guests, newly come out of Scotland.

This occasioning the affair to be divulged in all places, it came at last to the ears of the Duke of Somerset, lord of the manor of Corbridge, who demanded of Mr. Cookson the same, as his right. Mr. Cookson, being desired by his friends to acquiesce, and leave the whole to his grace's pleasure, his grace ordered Mr. Cookson to be paid back the money it cost, and over and a∣bove a present of money, 1758.
