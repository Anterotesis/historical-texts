<P>SIR,</P>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is not my Purpose, in this Address, to run into the common Tract of Dedicators, and attempt a Panegyric which would prove <HI>ungrateful</HI> to You, too <HI>arduous</HI> for Me, and <HI>superfluous</HI> with Regard to the World. To You it would prove <HI>ungrateful,</HI> since there is a certain generous
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
Delicacy in Men of the most distinguished Merit, disposing Them to avoid those Praises They so power∣fully attract. And when I consider that a <HI>Character,</HI> in which the VER∣TUES, the GRACES, and the MUSES join their Influence, as much exceeds the Expression of the most elegant and judicious Pen, as the finish'd <HI>Beauty</HI> does the Representation of the Pencil, I have the best Reasons for declining such an <HI>arduous</HI> Undertaking. As, indeed, it would be <HI>superfluous</HI> in it self; for what Reader need to be told of those great Abilities in the Manage∣ment of public Affairs, and those amia∣ble Accomplishments in private Life, which You so eminently possess. The general Voice is loud in the Praise of so many Vertues, tho' Posterity alone will do Them Justice. But may You, SIR, live long to illustrate your own Fame by your own Actions, and by
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
them be transmitted to future Times as the BRITISH MAECENAS!</P>
<P>YOUR Example has recommend∣ed POETRY, with the greatest Grace, to the Admiration of Those, who are engag'd in the highest and most active Scenes of Life: and this, tho' con∣fessedly the least considerable of those exalted Qualities that dignify your Cha∣racter, must be particularly pleasing to <HI>One,</HI> whose only Hope of being in∣troduced to your Regard is thro' the Recommendation of an ART in which You are a Master.—But I forget what I have been declaring above, and must therefore turn my Eyes to the following Sheets. I am not ignorant that, when offered to your Perusal, they are put into the Hands of one of the finest, and consequently the most indulgent Judges of the Age: but as there is no Mediocrity in POETRY,
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
so there should be no Limits to its Ambition.—I venture directly on the Tryal of my Fame.—If what I here present You has any Merit to gain your Approbation, I am not a∣fraid of its Success; and if it fails of your Notice, I give it up to its just Fate. This Advantage at least I se∣cure to myself, an Occasion of thus publickly declaring that I am, with the profoundest Veneration,</P>

He comes! attended by the sultry <HI>Hours,</HI></L>

<L>And is there ought in Sleep can charm the Wise?</L>
<L>To lie in dead Oblivion, lost to all,</L>

<L>Total Extinction of th' enlighten'd Soul!</L>
<L>Or else to feaverish Vanity alive,</L>

Wilder'd, and tossing thro' distemper'd Dreams.</L>
<L>Who would in such a gloomy State remain</L>
<L>Longer than Nature craves? When every <HI>Muse,</HI></L>
<L>And every blooming <HI>Pleasure</HI> wait without,</L>

<L>BUT yonder comes the powerful <HI>King</HI> of Day,</L>
<L>Rejoicing in the East. The lessening Cloud,</L>

High-gleaming from afar. Prime Chearer, <HI>Light!</HI></L>

<L>How many Forms of Being wait on Thee,</L>
<L>Inhaling Gladness! from th'unfetter'd Mind,</L>
<L>By Thee sublim'd, to that Day-living Race,</L>
<L>The mixing Myriads of thy evening Beam.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE vegetable World is also thine,</L>
<L>Parent of Seasons! from whose rich-stain'd Rays,</L>
<L>Reflected various, various Colours rise:</L>
<L><PB N="17" REF="15"/>
The freshening Mantle of the youthful Year;</L>
<L>The wild Embroidery of the watry Vale;</L>
<L>With all that chears the Eye, and charms the Heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THE branching Grove thy lusty Product stands,</L>
<L>To quench the Fury of thy Noon-Career;</L>
<L>And crowd a Shade for the retreating Swain,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>FRUIT is thy Bounty too, with Juice replete,</L>
<L>Acid, or mild; and from thy Ray receives</L>
<L>A Flavour pleasing to the Taste of Man.</L>
<L>By Thee concocted, blushes; and by Thee</L>
<L>Fully matur'd, into the verdant Lap</L>
<L>Of <HI>Industry,</HI> the mellow Plenty falls.</L>

<LG>
<PB N="18" REF="16"/>
<L>EXTENSIVE Harvests wave at thy Command,</L>

<L>EVEN <HI>Winter</HI> speaks thy Power, whose every Blast,</L>

<L>With breathing Frost, is eloquent of Thee,</L>

<L>A bleeding Radiance! grateful to the View.</L>
<L>From Thee the <HI>Saphire,</HI> solid Aether! takes</L>
<L>His Hue cerulean; and, of evening Tinct,</L>
<L>The Purple-streaming <HI>Amethyst</HI> is thine.</L>

<L>A trembling Variance of revolving Hues,</L>
<L>As the Site changes in the Gazer's Hand.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="18"/>
<L>THE very dead Creation, from thy Touch,</L>
<L>Assumes a mimic Life. By Thee refin'd,</L>
<L>In brisker Measures, the relucent Stream</L>
<L>Frisks o'er the Mead. The Precipice abrupt,</L>
<L>Projecting Horror on the blacken'd Flood,</L>
<L>Softens at thy Return. The Desart joys</L>
<L>Wildly, thro' all his melancholy Bounds.</L>
<L>Rude Ruins glitter; and the briny Deep,</L>
<L>Seen from some pointed Promontory's Top,</L>
<L>Reflects, from every fluctuating Wave,</L>
<L>A Glance, extensive as the Day. But these,</L>
<L>And all the much transported Muse can sing,</L>

<L>Unequal far, great, delegated Source,</L>

<LG>
<PB N="21" REF="19"/>
<L>HOW shall I then attempt to sing of Him,</L>
<L>Who, LIGHT HIMSELF, in uncreated Light,</L>

<L>From Mortal Eye, or Angel's purer Ken;</L>
<L>Whose single Smile has, from the First of Time,</L>

<L>And all th' extinguish'd Stars, would, loosening, reel</L>
<L>Wide, from their Spheres, and Chaos come again.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AND yet, was every faultering Tongue of Man,</L>
<L>ALMIGHTY POET! silent in thy Praise,</L>
<L>Thy matchless Works, in each exalted Line,</L>

<L>Often beguil'd. Some thro' the green-Wood Glade</L>
