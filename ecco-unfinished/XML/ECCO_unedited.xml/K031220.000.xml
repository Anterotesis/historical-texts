<HEAD>THE
Publisher's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Piece was accidentally drop'd near
the <HI>Mews</HI> Gate. I pick'd it up in my Way from
<HI>Charing-Cross</HI> to <HI>Hedge</HI> Lane. 'Twas in a lea∣thern
Case, which had once been red, but was
grown black with Grease, and tied round with a Scrap of
dirty Tape. When I open'd the Parcel, I found by an inge∣nious
Epigram, that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tape had formerly belong'd to Mrs. <HI>Haywood,</HI> (the divine <HI>Eliza!</HI>) but whether it had bound
her Hair, or was Part of her Apron-string, I shou'd have
been at a Loss to learn, had not the Relict been sanctified by
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Muse: He tritely compared it to <HI>Cytherea</HI>'s
Girdle, and sent it as a caluable Pledge of Friendship to
our Author. In this Pacquet were several Letters directed
to Mr. <HI>Iscariot Hackney,</HI> dated from the <HI>Ship</HI> Tavern, <HI>Cha∣ring-Cross,</HI> and signed <HI>J-m-s M—Sm-th, L. Th-b-ld, L.
W-lst-d, Edmund Curll, John Dennis, Thomas Cooke,</HI> and <HI>Bezaleel Morris.</HI> Those of the earliest Date import, that <HI>J-m-s M—Sm-th,</HI> Es{que} was unanimously chosen Speaker of
this Society. I met with many more Informations of this
Nature; but what pleased me most was the Performance of
our Author. I was curious to find out so excellent a Wri∣ter,
and have enter'd into a Treaty with him for future
Memoirs, which I have engaged to give the Publick.</P>
<P>It is with much Glee that I have mark'd the Herd bel∣lowing
against the <HI>Dunciad</HI> for Indelicacies. Not to mention
with what an ill Grace this Criticism comes from that
Quarter, I fancy it may easily be proved, that the grossest of
those Images are most suitable to the Subject; a Subject com∣posed,
for the most Part, of Authors, whose Writings are the
Refuse of Wit, and who in Life are as the very Excre∣ment
<PB REF="4"/>
of Nature. Yet even here Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> shews himself a
Master. It is true that he has used Dung; but he disposes
that Dung in such a Manner, that it becomes rich Ma∣nure,
from which he raises a Variety of fine Flowers. He
deals in Rags, but he deals with them like an Artist,
who commits them to a Paper-Mill, and brings them out
useful Sheets. The Chymist extracts a fine Cordial from
the most nauseous of all Dung, and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has drawn a
sweet, poetical Spirit from the most offensive and unpoetical
Objects of the Creation—Unpoetical, tho' eternal Writers of
Poetry.</P>
<P>I have also laugh'd at the Clamour of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Bathos</HI> against the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> for insulting them on their
Poverty. I own that a Man's Poverty, when it proceeds
not from any Folly, but is owing, (as it often happens) to his
Vertue, sets him in an amiable Light. He becomes the Ob∣ject
of Compassion; and, if he bears his Misfortunes like a
Man, instead of falling into Contempt, raises our Admira∣tion.
But when his Wants are of his own seeking, and prove
the Motive of every ill Action, (for the Poverty of bad Au∣thors
has always a bad Heart for its Companion) is it not
a Vice, and properly the Subject of Satire?</P>
<P>Most of these Persons are of very low Parentage, and with∣out
any Pretence of Merit, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aspiring to the Rank of Gen∣tlemen.
Thus they become ill Oeconimists, Poverty is the
Consequence of ill Oeconomy, and dirty Tricks the Consequence
of their Poverty. Tho they are sad Writers, they might have
been good Mechanicks; and therefore by endeavouring to
shine in Spheres, to which they are unequal, are guilty of de∣priving
the Publick of many that might have been its useful
Members.</P>
<P>Methinks when the World is so ungrateful as not to read
their Writings, they might vouchsafe to follow the Example
of the great Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> (tho' an Author undoubtedly
inferior to them) who, when he heard the First Part
of his History succeeded not, had Spirit enough to commit
the Second to the Flames: But the Gentlemen of the <HI>Bathos</HI>
<PB REF="5"/>
are apt, like bad Horses, to run faster immediately after
stumbling. Shou'd the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> declare, that
the great Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> (the Son of a <HI>Sadler</HI>) had better have
been a common Parish Cryer, than a Poet or Critick! Have
not forty Years, and upwards, witness'd the Truth of this?
Is it not evident, that his Poverty results from a Misapplica∣tion
of his Talents?</P>
<P>Had it not been an honester and more decent Livelyhood
for Mr. <HI>N-rt-n (Daniel</HI>'s Son of Love, by a Lady, who vended
Oysters) to have dealt in a <HI>Fish-Market,</HI> than to be dealing
out the Dialects of <HI>Billingsgate</HI> and Detracton in the <HI>Flying
Post?</HI></P>
<P>Shoud not Mr. <HI>R-ch-rd M-rl-y</HI> rather have been blacking
Shoes at the Corner of Streets (to which, it is well known
his industrious, and more prudent younger <HI>Brother</HI> submitted)
than black'ning Reputations in the <HI>History</HI> of <HI>Mother Wise-bourn,</HI>
and <HI>Weekly Journals?</HI> The <HI>Black'ning</HI> of the <HI>Brush</HI> from the <HI>Japan Pot</HI> is so useful and ornamental, that it is
frequently call'd <HI>Honour;</HI> but the Dash of <HI>Dick</HI>'s <HI>Pen,</HI> so often
dipt in an <HI>Ink Standish</HI> is dirty, and detrimental, conse∣quently
<HI>Dishonour;</HI> so that <HI>Dick</HI> and his <HI>Brother</HI> illustrate
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Saying,</HI> Some are made to HONOUR, and
some to <HI>DISHONOUR.</HI></P>
<P>Had it not been more laudable in Mr. <HI>R—m,</HI> the Son of
an <HI>Undertaker,</HI> to have borne a <HI>Link,</HI> and a <HI>Mourning Staff</HI>
in the <HI>long Procession</HI> of a <HI>Funeral,</HI> than to have been fre∣quently
<HI>lamenting</HI> the <HI>Burials</HI> of his <HI>miserable, short-lived
Libels?</HI> Had it not been more pious in him, to have sung
Psalms, according to Education, in an <HI>Anabaptist Meeting,</HI>
than to have been altering the <HI>Jovial Crew,</HI> or <HI>Merry Beg∣gars</HI>
into a <HI>wicked</HI> Imitation of the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> the Translator of <HI>Hesiod,</HI> is the Son
of a <HI>Muggletonian-Teacher,</HI> who kept a little obscure Ale∣house
at <HI>Braintree</HI> in <HI>Essex.</HI> Tho' this Author has no more
Genius for Poetry than a Snail, nay less than Mr. <HI>Ambrose
Phillips,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Welsted;</HI> and though he would consequently
have wanted Spirit enough for his Father's Tapster; yet
<PB REF="6"/>
his Enemies confess him not without Merit: To do the
Man Justice, he might have made a tolerable Figure as
a <HI>Taylor.</HI> 'Twere too presumtuous to affirm he cou'd have
been a <HI>Master</HI> in any Profession; but, dull as I allow him, he
wou'd not have been despicable for a third, or fourth hand <HI>Journeyman.</HI> Then had his Wants been avoided; for he
wou'd at least have learn'd, to cut his <HI>Coat according to
his Cloth.</HI></P>
<P>Why wou'd not Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> continue an Attorney? Is
not <HI>Word-catching</HI> more serviceable in splitting a Cause, than
explaining a fine Poet?</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>H-yw—d</HI> grew too homely for a <HI>Strolling
Actress,</HI> why might not the Lady, (tho' once a <HI>Theatrical
Queen)</HI> have subsisted by turning <HI>Washer-woman?</HI> Has not
the Fall of Greatness been a frequent Distress in all Ages?
She might have caught a beautiful Bubble as it arose from
the Suds of her Tub, blown it in Air, seen it glitter,
and then break! Even in this low Condition, she had
play'd with a Bubble, and what more is the Vanity
of human Greatness? She might have also consider'd the
sullied Linnen growing white in her pretty red Hands,
as an Emblem of her Soul, were it well <HI>scoured</HI> by Repentance
for the Sins of her Youth: But she rather chuses starving by
writing Novels of Intriegue, to teach young Heiresses the Art
of running away with Fortune-hunters, and scandalizing
Persons of the highest Worth and Distinction.</P>
<P>When this Lady, or these Gentlemen are ask'd why they
abuse such and such Persons, their Answer is, they are ob∣liged
to write for want of Money, and to abuse for want of
other Subjects. Is want of Money an Excuse for picking a
Pocket? Or what is worse, taking away a Man's good
Name? Is the Poverty of <HI>Moore</HI>'s Genius an Excuse for <HI>filching Pope</HI>'s Lines? And appears not the Theft in his Co∣medy
as plain, as if a Cinder-Wench shou'd steal a Gold
Watch, and afterwards wear it? If this Play was brought
forth, because his Circumstances were reduced, was he to
retrieve 'em by committing poetical Felonies, and afterwards
<PB REF="7"/>
being the first to cry out Thief? Deserves he not a whipping
for such petty Lasceny? By a whipping be it known I only
mean the poetical, wholesome Lash of Satire. A <HI>Danish</HI> Co∣lonel
has lately condescended to be a common Centinel, and
were <HI>Jemmy</HI>'s Heart as firm as his Countenance, had it not
been more graceful in him, to have carry'd a Grenadier's
Cap, a Buff-Coat, and a brown Musquet? He is a proper
Figure, and of an exact Size for his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty's
Service. Then had his Comedy been <HI>fritter'd</HI> into <HI>Oxford
Jests,</HI> each of his Acquaintance had claim'd their own,
and he escap'd the Hisses and Horse-laughs of the Town,
for spoiling and misapplying 'em in a damn'd Play.</P>
<P>Methinks <HI>Laurus</HI> had better been an University Vintner,
than a <HI>Divine,</HI> or <HI>Poet?</HI> Wou'd not bad Wine have been easier
put off than bad Poetry? Had not a Bunch of Grapes flou∣rish'd
more naturally on his Brow, than a Sprig of Bays?
Had he not with more Propriety been seen sitting astride a <HI>Butt</HI> with a Bottle in one Hand, and a Bumper in the other,
roaring out a merry Catch, than mounting after the first
Stave to thump a Pulpit Cushion, and pause at every half
Sentence with a Hiccup.?</P>
<P>If Poverty in these Lights is judged not a Subject for Ri∣dicule,
I refer the Reader to <HI>Iscariot Hackney,</HI> and after
his Acquaintance with that <HI>Spark,</HI> I will only address
my self in these few Words to the Allies of <HI>Charing-Cross.</HI> Say Gentlemen, has the <HI>Dunciad</HI> lash'd your Poverty? A
much severer Satire on it you may find in your own Lives.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> What is mentioned in the following Letter con∣cerning
the <HI>British Journal,</HI> relates only to the Con∣duct
of that Paper before it took the Title of the

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEING
A PROPOSAL to the Knights, Esquires, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> AM glad to find you meddle with the dirty
Works of your Brother Journalists. To be
inoffensive is a puritannical Spirit, and will ne∣ver
succeed in a free-thinking Age. What is
Gold itself (says the Philosopher) but Dirt? It
is dug out of dirty Mines; and, as a Proof it
retains its Nature, we come at it easiest thro' dirty Means.
Be assured, a Scavenger of Wit is a more gainful Occupation
than that of a delicate, moral Writer.</P>
<P>BY this I mean to let you see my Ability and to proffer my
Service. You must know when my Mother was pregnant of
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
me, she once dreamt she was delivered of a Monster. It
was observed also, at the Time of my Birth, that a Weezle was
heard to shriek; and a Bat (tho' at Noon Day) flew into
the Room, and settled upon the Midwife's Wrist, just as she
received me. While in the Cradle I was very froward.
Early at School I discovered a promising Genius for Mischief.
I carried Tales from one Boy to another to set them a fight∣ing,
and afterwards to the Master to have them whipp'd. I
had always Cunning enough, when I committed a Fault, to
lay the Blame upon another, and laugh'd to see him suffer
for it. (A sure Prognostick of my future Judgment in Poli∣ticks!)
I was fond of tearing away the Legs and Wings of
Flies, of picking out the Eyes of some little Bird, or laming
some favourite Lap-Dog, merely by way of Amusement.
This was only a Sign, that one time or other I should have
Ill-nature enough for a <HI>great Wit.</HI> Now I understand to be
a <HI>great Wit,</HI> is to take a Pleasure in giving every Body Pain,
and to shew no Mercy to a Reputation, which is dearer to
some Fools than perhaps a Limb, or an Eye. I was also gi∣ven
to pilser whatever lay in my Way; a Proof only that I
wou'd never scruple being a Plagiary, shou'd I turn Author.
I was expert at almost every thing except learning my Book;
but neither Encouragement nor Correction could bring me to
any Sense of Duty. I was always very sullen after being
corrected; and if my Master forgave, and admonished me
in a friendly Manner, I all the while ridiculed the old <HI>Put,</HI>
(as I then call'd him) by making Mouths or Horns over his
Shoulder. This shew'd I had always Wit enough to laugh at
the common Notion of Gratitude. I hooted at any unfortu∣nate,
ill-dress'd Person in the Street, if he look'd like a Gen∣tleman,
and never fail'd to mock the Infirmities of <HI>old Age.</HI>
When at a Sermon, I was very full of Play myself, and fond
of interrupting the Devotion of others; so that (I thank my
Stars!) in my Youth I had a fashionable Contempt for Reli∣gion.
I came young into the World with little Education,
less Money, and no visible Way of living: However, I qua∣lified
myself (tho' of mean Birth) for a Gentleman of Wit
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
and Humour about Town. I have naturally a Sourness of
Temper, a droll Solemnity of Countenance, and a dry Manner
of joking upon such Accidents, as Fools who value themselves
upon Humanity, would be apt to compassionate. I have also
a Propensity to sneer upon all Mankind, and particularly upon
those who fancy they can oblige me. These elegant Quali∣ties
recommended me early to the Friendship of <HI>Dick
Morley,</HI> Author of <HI>Mother Wiseborn.</HI> We met frequently
at a little, snug Gaming-House, never yet discovered by in∣forming
Constables. A Similitude of Circumstances and Sym∣pathy
of Souls endeared us to each other; and to him I owe the
Improvements of my afore-mentioned Faculties. These he cul∣tivated,
and many others implanted in me of the like Nature.</P>
<P>WE commenced Authors together. At my first setting out
I was hired by a reverend Prebend to libel Dean <HI>Swift</HI> for
Infidelity. Soon after I was employed by <HI>Curll</HI> to write a
merry Tale, the Wit of which was its Obscenity. This we
agreed to palm upon the World for a posthumous Piece of
Mr. <HI>Prior.</HI> However, a certain Lady, celebrated for certain
Liberties, had a Curiosity to see the real Author. <HI>Curll,</HI> on
my Promise that if I had a Present, he should go Snacks, sent
me to her. I was admitted while her Ladyship was <HI>shifting;</HI>
and on my Admittance, Mrs. <HI>Abigail</HI> was order'd to with∣draw.
What passed between us, a Point of Gallantry obliges
me to conceal; but after some extraordinary Civilities, I was
dismiss'd with a Purse of Guineas, and a Command to write
a Sequel to my Tale. Upon this I turn'd out smart in Dress,
bit <HI>Curll</HI> of his Share, and run out most of my Money in
printing my Works at my own Cost. But some Years after
(just at the time of his starving poor <HI>Pattison</HI>) the Varlet
was revenged. He arrested me for several Months Board,
brought me back to my Garret, and made me drudge on in
my old, dirty Work. 'Twas in his Service that I wrote Ob∣scenity
and Profaneness, under the Names of <HI>Pope</HI> and
<HI>Swift.</HI> Sometimes I was Mr. <HI>Joseph Gay,</HI> and at others
Theory <HI>Burnet,</HI> or <HI>Addison.</HI> I abridg'd Histories and Tra∣vels,
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
translated from the <HI>French,</HI> what they never wrote, and
was expert at finding out new Titles for old Books. When
a notorious Thief was hanged, I was the <HI>Plutarch</HI> to pre∣serve
his Memory; and when a great Man died, mine were
his Remains, and mine the Account of his last Will and Te∣stament.
Had Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> agreed, my Assi∣stance
had probably been invited into Father <HI>Boheur</HI>'s Lo∣gick,
and the critical History of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT before all this happen'd, a young Nobleman gratified
me for letting some Verses of mine be handed about at Court
in Manuscript under his Name. This was the first Time that
I ever heard my Writings generally commended. But alas!
how short-lived the Appl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use? They unfortunately stole into
Print, lost their Reputation at once, and I am now asham'd to
write any more, as a Person of Quality. I am a great Joker,
and deal in Clenches, Puns, Quibbles, Gibes, Conundrums, and
carry Whichits. Many a good Time have I lash'd the whole
Body of Clergy, and crack'd many a smart Joke upon the Trini∣ty.
One of my Books had the Honour of being presented for a
Libel, by the Grand-Jury, and another was made a Burnt-Offering
by the Hands of the Common Hangman. When an
Author writes a Piece that has Success in his own Character,
I abuse him; but if in a fictitious one, I endeavour to perso∣nate
him, and write a Second Part to his Work. I am very
deeply read in all Pieces of Scandal, Obscenity, and Profane∣ness,
particularly in the Writings of Mrs. <HI>Haywood, Henley,
W'—lst—d, Morley, Br—v—l, Foxton, Cooke, D'Foe, Norton,
Woolston, Dennis,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Rival Modes.</HI> From
these I propose to compile a very grand Work, which shall
not be inferior to <HI>Utopia, Carimania, Gulliverania, Art of
Flogging, Daily Journal</HI> Epigrams on the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> or
<HI>Oratory Transactions;</HI> and as this is designed for the Use of
young Templers, it is hoped they will promote my Subscrip∣tion.
Since private Vices have been proved to be publick
Benefits, I wou'd venture to call it, <HI>An useful Body of</HI> IM∣MORALITY,
and print it in a broad, pompous Folio; but such
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
a one as may very well be bound up with Dean <HI>Smedley</HI>'s in∣tended
<HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>BY the Help of Indexes, and technical Dictionaries, I work
on every Branch of Learning. I pore often over the Volumes
of State Tracts, whence I collect Paragraphs which I mix
with Remarks of my own, and range under several Heads.
Those against a discarded Minister I send to the <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>British Journals,</HI> and others more virulent against a Prime
One (for I naturally hate my Superiors) are for my very good
Friend the <HI>Craftsman.</HI> Rather than stand out of Play, I have
penn'd Panegyricks in <HI>Mist</HI> on <HI>Rich</HI>'s Pantomines, and <HI>Theo∣bald</HI>'s
<HI>Shakespears Restored.</HI> I am always listed by Mr. <HI>Lun</HI>
the Harlequin, to hiss the first Night at any of the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
Performances. Sometimes I draw up Challenges for the
Champions of Mr. <HI>Figg</HI>'s Amphitheatre, and sometimes for
the Disputants of Mr. <HI>Henley</HI>'s Oratory.</P>
<P>I HAVE an excellent Knack at Birth-day Odes, Elogies,
Acrosticks, Anagrams, Epithalamiums, Prologues, Recom∣mendatory
Poems, Rhimes for Almanack-Makers, and witty
Distichs for the Signs of Country Inns and Ale-houses. When
with an audible Voice I spout forth my own Verses, marve∣lous
is their Effect! The very Bellman has been touch'd with
Envy!—An Author, who like Mr. <HI>Ralph,</HI> has distinguish'd
himself by <HI>Night;</HI> the Shrilness of my clamorous, dunning
Landlady has been charm'd into a still Attention! Nay, the
very Bailiff, in act to rush upon me, has stop'd short to listen,
and for a Minute suspended the rapacious Palm that was to
fall upon my Shoulder!</P>
<P>I HAVE well perused the Writings of <HI>Luke Milbourn, Shad∣well,
Settle, Blackmore,</HI> and many others of our Stamp, no∣table
for salt Wit upon <HI>Dryden.</HI> From these I have extract∣ed
curious Hints to assist <HI>Welsted</HI> in his new Satire against
<HI>Pope,</HI> which was once (he told me) to have been christen'd
<HI>Labeo.</HI> 'Tis yet an Embrio, and there are divers Opinions
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
about the Birth of it. Some expect it will spring from his
wise Noddle, like <HI>Minerva</HI> from the Head of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and
work Wonders. Others, that it will resemble <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fi∣gure
of <HI>Sin</HI> coming from the Brain of the Father of Lies.
Then, say they, it will damn its Parent's Reputation. But
most are of Opinion, that my Brother has no Reputation to
lose, and therefore the Brat will be still-born. 'Tis possible
<HI>Barnham Goode</HI> also may miscarry of his <HI>Mock Aesop,</HI> tho'
<HI>James Moore Smythe,</HI> Es{que} is to officiate Man-Midwife.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man of Quality is distinguish'd for Wit, or an
Encourager of it, I endeavour to strike him for a Dedication;
but I have generally been so unhappy as to disgust my Patrons
by praising them in the wrong Place. For want of being ac∣quainted
with polite Life, I have unwittingly complemented
a Person for an illustrious Birth, who really owed his Rise en∣tirely
to his Merit. Thus have I caused his Enemies to sneer,
and, perhaps, to libel him for my squab Complement; when,
had I left him to his Choice, he had rather chose my Satire
than my Panegyrick.</P>
<P>THERE is a certain Right Honourable <HI>Didapper Knight</HI> of
the <HI>BATH-os,</HI> a Man of my Namesake, <HI>Iscariot</HI>'s own Pro∣bity,
and famous, like one of the Suitors in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Odyssey,</HI> for
<HI>dead-born Jests.</HI> Many a Sonnet of mine, and several <HI>Bouts
Rimez</HI> that were filled up by me, has he read with his usual
Modesty, at <HI>White</HI>'s and the Drawing-Room for his own; but as
they were mere Slips of my Pen, and could be of no Advantage
to my Reputation, (low as it stands) I am contented to humour
his Vanity, and forbear to claim them. To deal plainly, this
little Knight is a Person whom I, even I, <HI>Iscariot Hackney,</HI>
treat with Contempt; and furthermore, I fear no Revenge
from him for publishing this Declaration, unless he should
<HI>breathe</HI> upon me—It must be confess'd, indeed, there is a
strange Influence in all that issues from his <HI>Mouth.</HI> I assisted
him in a pretty Play of Words on the Letter <HI>P,</HI> and the Ad∣vertisement
of the <HI>Lady</HI>'s <HI>Writing Desk;</HI> for which our
<PB N="7" REF="14"/>
Printer underwent the Discipline of the Cane. I was really sor∣ry
for the poor Fellow's Misfortune, and cou'd have heartily
wished it had fallen with more Justice and less Mercy on the
little smart Knight. Soon after I chopp'd Sides, and wrote
the <HI>History of the Norfolk Dumpling,</HI> the Verses on the
<HI>Norfolk Lanthorn,</HI> and many other popular Libels on Persons
who least deserv'd them; but the Reason of that was, be∣cause
they were of the Ministry.</P>
<P>Now is the Session of Parliament, and the Poetical Quar∣rels
must give way to the Political. Consequently the Affairs
of State (as <HI>Abel</HI> in the Play of the <HI>Committee</HI> observes) <HI>will
lie heavy upon my Neck and Shoulders.</HI> It is a Custom a∣mong
great Generals to send Spies into an Enemy's Camp,
and among Politicians to employ 'em in foreign Courts. I
have therefore (as I am determined to oppose the Ministry)
settled a secret Correspondence with several Gentlemen of the
Party-colour'd Cloth; Men of Dignity! such as have no less
an Honour than that of holding a Plate in the Presence of
some certain Knights of the Blue Ribbon. My Bribe is a Pot
of Ale, and my Intelligence the Scraps of Conversation that
fall at the Table of great Ministers. By these I am enabled
to discuss the Matters in debate at the <HI>House of Commons,</HI>
and the Congress of <HI>Soissons,</HI> to state the Debts of the Na∣tion,
to arraign the Conduct of those at Helm, and to
hold the Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> with as much Ease as a Monkey
does a Chesnut, in my own Paw.</P>
<P>THE Time has been when, after an Evening's hard booz∣ing,
my brother Bards (who have been what we call Seedy
or Crop-sick) have bilked the publick House, and barbarously
left me in pawn for the Reckoning. On this Emergency I
have written an Account of a <HI>sharp and bloody Fight, a Vi∣sion
in the Air,</HI> or a <HI>Wonderful Prophecy</HI> to be hawk'd about
Streets: And (wou'd you believe it?) even these Producti∣ons
of mine have pass'd for design'd Wit, and I have
<PB N="8" REF="15"/>
silently sneered, to find the Merit of them claimed and boast∣ed
of by <HI>Jemmy Moore,</HI> and the above-mention'd <HI>Knight.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE sometimes taken it in my Head, that I might
make a Fortune by writing for the Stage. As a Proof that I
have an excellent Taste, I always despised the Tragedies of
<HI>Shakespeare, Otway;</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> and preferr'd with Admira∣tion
Mr. <HI>Rolli</HI>'s Opera's at the <HI>Hay-Market.</HI> I wonder, that
the Success of the Latter shou'd be applied to Mr. <HI>Hendell</HI>'s
Musick, or the Performances of <HI>Senesino, Faustina,</HI> and <HI>Cut∣zoni:</HI>
the Town in this have been shamefully blind to the
Merit of Mr. <HI>Rolli.</HI> He has followed the Antients so closely
in the Propriety of his Conduct, the Unity of his Characters,
the natural Variety of Passions, the Strength of Sentiment,
and the Elegance of Diction, that I here invite him to join
with me in an <HI>English</HI> Tragedy on an Opera Plan.</P>
<P>IF the Gentleman thinks this too arduous an Undertaking,
let us venture at a lower Cast! In fine, let us make the Town
an ample Amends for the Suppression of Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s Sequel!
without any Recourse to Wit, Humour, Natural Dialogue,
Songs aptly introduced, or any other of those Trifles with
which the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> abounds. We have one sure Com∣fort;
that is, we cannot fall short of Mr. <HI>Johnson's Village
Opera,</HI> nor be excell'd by <HI>R—m</HI> and his Didapper <HI>Knight:
R—m</HI> cannot excel me, unless he excels himself.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried all Means (but what Fools call honest ones)
for a Livelihood. I offer'd my Service for a secret Spy to the
State; but had not Credit enough even for that. When it
was indeed very low with me, I printed Proposals for a Sub∣scription
to my Works, received Money, and gave Receipts
without any Intention of delivering the Book. Tho' I have
been notoriously prophane, and was never at an University, I
once aim'd to be admitted into Orders; but being obliged to
abscond lately from the Parish-Officers, on Account of a Ba∣stard
<PB N="9" REF="16"/>
Child, and falling besides into an unlucky Salivation,
my Character was so scandalous, that I cou'd not prevail even
on the lowest of the Fleet-Prison Parsons to sign my Testi∣monials.</P>
<P>MY last Attempt was to have been a Travelling Tutor to
some young Gentleman. If I am deficient in Classic Lear∣ning,
I cou'd yet have instructed him in the Laws of his own
Country; for tho' I never studied <HI>Coke</HI> upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> yet I
have conversed with Bailiffs and petty-fogging Attornies; nay,
I have conn'd over the <HI>Abridgements of</HI> Giles Jacob; I cou'd
also have read him Lectures of Politicks from Essays of my
own in <HI>Weekly Journals.</HI> What, tho' I wanted Knowledge
to make Dissertations upon the Languages, Manners, Histories,
Statutes, Coins, Paintings, Architecture, or any other Curio∣sities,
ancient or modern of foreign Climes? what, tho' I
cou'd not have traced out any one Country in a Map? cou'd
I not have pillaged Voyage Writers, and have taken the Re∣ports
of Inn-Keepers or Postilions, to have told where there
were good Wine, good Beds, buxom Girls, and tall Steeples?
Few foreign Tutors understand the dead Languages; but if
they play at Cards, dance, talk of Things they never saw;
or, having seen, cou'd not understand; if they put on the
swaggering Air of Half-pay Captains, and swear <HI>French</HI> mili∣tary
Oaths with a <HI>bon Grace,</HI> will they not pass for Men of
Wit, Experience, and Knowledge? I shou'd have made a ve∣ry
fashionable Tutor, I wou'd have spirited up my Pupil to
run away with a Nun; and, if he aimed at smaller Game,
not scrupled being Pimp. I have studied Physick under
the <HI>Anodyne Necklace</HI> Doctor, and wou'd have prepared,
and exported a whole Cargo of <HI>Anti-venereal</HI> Pills for his
Safety. No one, I am perswaded will blame me, if I took
this Opportunity of feathering my own Nest. I shou'd per∣haps
have made him pay Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> for his own Money,
when I disbursed it, and a Guinea on many Occasions for his
Honour; twenty Shillings of which I might have put in my
own Pocket. Who knows but I might have married some rich
Widow by securing my Pupil for one of her Daughters? I
<PB N="10" REF="17"/>
wou'd have contrived he shou'd have stolen the young Lady
to avoid paying her Fortune. If this Scheme failed, I had
another, for which I am afraid I might have been a little cen∣sured;
'twas only to have set him at a gaming Table (when
abroad) for about a thousand Pounds, and afterwards gone
Snacks with the Sharpers. But on second Thoughts, where
had been the Hurt? When return'd, and at Age, I cou'd ea∣sily
have made him Amends, by negotiating a Mortgage, or
the Sale of a Reversion for him with honest <HI>Ch-rt-r-s.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, tho' I had but a hundred a Year, and for no more
than two, or three Years Service, I cou'd retire to <HI>Swisserland,</HI>
or <HI>Wales,</HI> with about Fifteen Hundred Pounds in my Pocket,
and an Anuity of fifty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for Life. In
such a Retirement I shou'd have set down like my Brother
<HI>Br-v-l</HI> to writing an <HI>Account of my Travels.</HI> When those
were finished, by carefully extracting from Gazettes, I shou'd
have been able to have left my Executors the Memoirs of
my own Times, then wou'd I have indulged my Spleen a∣gainst
the present Ministers, for neglecting to gratify my Me∣rit.
'Tis dangerous to anger a Poet or Historian.</P>
<P>I observed at the Head of this Letter, that I have a Drol∣lery
in my Countenance; Egad! 'tis as <HI>peculiar</HI> a One as
<HI>R-m's.</HI> We are so like, that before he scribled himself in∣to
Preferment, we have actually been mistaken for each o∣ther.
Our Looks are so happy, as to have pass'd off many a
Saying in Conversation for Wit and Humour, that, when pub∣lished,
has been thought flat: Nay, the same Thing has been
said of me, as was utter'd by a certain <HI>Wit</HI> (one very different
from our Rank) on him, viz. that the <HI>R-g-'s Misfortune is,
he cannot print his Face to his Joke.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I am thus delineating my Features, permit me to
own, that I wish my Portrait might shine in a <HI>Mezitento</HI>
thro' the Glass-Windows of Picture-Shops in <HI>Fleet-Street,</HI> and
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard; then shou'd I be gaz'd on with Ad∣miration
by Mercers 'Prentices! But I will at least Indulge my
<PB N="11" REF="18"/>
Vanity in appearing on a large Sheet of Paper, in a Wooden
Cut, which ingenious School-Boys may delight to Colour
with yellow and red <HI>Ocker.</HI> What a glaring Figure shall
I then make in the long Piazza of <HI>Covent-Garden!</HI> I shall be
surrounded by venerable Old Ballads; and several of my
Family Pieces, such as the <HI>Sinners Coat of Arms,</HI> and the
dreadful Sketches of <HI>Death, Judgment,</HI> and <HI>Damnation!</HI>
Thence shall I be translated to the naked Walls of Country
Ale-houses, Coblers Stalls, and Necessary Houses!—And
thou, O <HI>R-m,</HI> thou who art my <HI>other self!</HI> be this thy
Glory! however different our Fortunes, however unlike the
Incidents of our Lives; yet whensoe'er the Countenance of
<HI>Iscariot Hackney</HI> is seen, thy own <HI>dear Phiz</HI> will be called
to Remembrance.</P>
<P>IN short, I am a perfect Town Author: I hate all Man∣kind,
yet am occasionally a mighty Patriot. I am very poor,
and owe my Poverty to my Merit; that is, to my Writings:
I am as proud as I am poor; yet, what is seemingly a Con∣tradiction,
never stick at a mean Action, when the Welfare
of the Republick of Letters; or, in other Words, my own
Interest is concerned. My Pen, like the Sword of a <HI>Swiss,</HI>
or the pleading of a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> is generally employed for <HI>Pay.</HI>
There is one Piece of Advice, Gentlemen, which I wou'd pro∣pose
to you: If any Papers of a <HI>dead Wit</HI> shou'd fall into the
Hands of a Member of your Society, let him be sure to print
them, tho' never so derrogatory to the Person's Reputation,
to get himself Money; and if, among whole Heaps of indi∣gested
Papers, he finds a few with large <HI>Corrections</HI> and <HI>Ad∣ditions</HI>
by <HI>another eminent Hand</HI> (which he well knows) let
him be sure to suppress <HI>that Circumstance</HI> in his Publication.</P>
<P>BUT to return to myself—My Pamphlets sell many more
Impressions than those of celebrated Writers; the Secret of
this is, I learned from <HI>Curll</HI> to clap a new Title-Page to
the Sale of every half Hundred; so that when my Bookseller
has sold Two Hundred and Fifty Copies, my Book generally
enters into the <HI>Sixth Edition,</HI> 'Tis reckon'd a villanous
<PB N="12" REF="19"/>
Action to write a Libel, but more so to father one on a Per∣son,
who neither wrote it, nor approves it; now, I own I ne∣ver
scruple to do both. When a Man of Figure (perhaps an
Ornament of his Country) has been cruelly aspersed in his
Life-time, I love to revive the Aspersion at his Death: It is
Mirth to me to grieve a whole Family, by insulting his Me∣mory
before his Body is cold in the Grave. In this I imitate
the Author of <HI>Sarah the Quaker in the Shades,</HI> to <HI>Lotha∣rio
lately deceased.</HI> Tho' I am so ready to libe. others, I am
downright frighten'd if I but hear of a Satire where my Name
is likely to be inserted. When a Person does me a Favour, I
either suspect he has some Design on me; or think it less than
my due, and that he is obliged to me, because an <HI>Author,</HI> for
accepting it. I am very testy if I am not allow'd <HI>Dictator</HI>
of my Company; nor had I ever a Friend, whom I did not in
his Absence sacrifice to my Jest. I comtemn the Few who ad∣mire
me, am angry with the Multitude who despise me, and
mortally hate all, who have any Ways obliged me. I assure
you I am very famous for several Treatises in Defence of <HI>In∣gratitude.</HI>
I never fail to illustrate them with the Examples of
<HI>Marcus Brutus</HI> among the <HI>Ancients,</HI> and very eminent <HI>States∣men</HI>
among the <HI>Moderns.</HI> My private Resentment, like that of
other <HI>Great Men,</HI> is always a publick Justice.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, if you like me for a Correspondent, my
Price is the Price of a <HI>Journalist,</HI> a Crown; and, in the Stile
of a Love Bargain, Half Wet, Half Dry. You may find me in
a Morning at my Lucubrations, over a Quartern Pot in a <HI>Ge∣neva</HI>
Shop in <HI>Clare-Marke<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> a House where I propose many
learned Interviews with Orator <HI>Henley,</HI> who has removed his
<HI>Stage</HI> to that Place. I generally dine with a Brother <HI>Bard</HI> at
one of the little Cook's Shops near St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Church, and
pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ably spend the Evening with him at a Night-Cellar in the
