<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the LIFE and DEATH of Sir John Dineley Goodere, Bart.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S the inhuman murder of sir J. Dineley, my unfortunate uncle, has made so great a noise as to excite the public attention, some persons have made their advan∣tage of this circumstance, in or∣der to palm upon the world a false account of the matter. We must not wonder that the horrid fact I am about to treat of, as well as capt. Goodere's conduct and lady Dineley's character, have been greatly misrepresented: which makes it necessary to set those particu∣lars in a clear light, in order to do justice to the memory of the deceased and to the cha∣racters of the living. Capt. Goodere was ac∣counted a man of honour 'till he murdered his brother; and sir J. Dineley, a plain ho∣nest gentleman, was reckoned a very sad fel∣low, lived almost universally hated, and died unlamented.</P>
<P>I shall only relate such matters of fact as came within the verge of my own knowledge.</P>
<P>Sir John Dineley's grandfather and grand∣mother, by his mother's side, where sir Edw. Dineley, of Charlton, Worcestershire, and
<PB N="4" REF="5"/>
Frances, a sister to the earl of Rockingham. His father, sir Edw. Goodere of Burghope, Herefordshire, married miss Dineley, their only daughter, by whom that estate came into the Goodere family. Sir Edw. Dineley, by will, had settled his estate upon his daugh∣ter's eldest son. Sir J. Dineley, at that time, was a younger son, and had no great prospect in point of fortune, his father having a great many children. As sir Edw. Dineley had the care of all the young gentlemen's educa∣tion, he was determined not to adhere to that false principle which had so much prevailed amongst the English gentry, of rather letting their younger children starve, than derogate from the dignity of their family by putting any of them to trade; wherefore this young gentleman was placed very rarly in the mer∣chant's sea service; and, after he had served the usual time, had the command of a ship given him. At this juncture unfortunately for him as it afterwards proved, his elder bro∣ther was killed in a duel in Ireland. Upon this sir John was sent for to Charlton. With much reluctance he left the service; but he obeyed the will of his grandfather, and en∣tered upon a way of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife quite new and singu∣lar to him. Sir Edw. Dineley soon after died. Lady Goodere was the only person between sir John and the estate, and she did not sur∣vive her father many years. Sir John suc∣ceeded to the estate, without an education suitable to such a rank; for, with all due de∣ference to the gentlemen of the navy, a ship was not at that time thought a proper academy
<PB N="5" REF="6"/>
for politeness, nor the art of navigation a necessary ingredient towards composing a so∣cial character. Under these disadvantages sir John came to his estate: but opened this part of his life with an action which gave sufficient proof of the natural goodness of his heart. Sir E. Goodere, upon his lady's death, found himself fal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en, from very flourishing circum∣stances, to a narrow income: Sir John, who knew his father's temper, was aware how an affair of this kind would affect sir Edward's Iosty spirit, and voluntarily consented to the enlargement of his father's fortune, by con∣tracting his own. Henley hall, on the banks of the Severn, Worcestershire, about 500 l. a year, was desired by sir Edward, and devised by-sir John to his father's use for life.</P>
<P>But I will relate an affair which was much exaggerated to sir John's disadvantage, and which, I am sorry to say it, it is not in my power fully to vindicate.—The funeral of sir Edw. Goodere drew a general odium on sir J. Dineley. The very great obligation that sir John had laid on his father, made it natu∣ral for the son to expect that s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Edward would make some returns for this favour at his death; but con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulting his will, sir John found him∣self only tenant for life, subject to an im∣peachment of waste. Sir Edward had like∣wise often assured him, that what he left would be free and unincumbered; but, upon exa∣mination, sir Edward's debts amounted to above 500 l. and both his real and personal estates bound for the payment of them. This
<PB N="6" REF="7"/>
usage sir John resented not a little; and not being philosopher enough to master his passions, he, in the heat of blood, hurried away his father, and buried him in a preci∣pitate and slighting manner.</P>
<P>Some time aster his mother's death, he m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rried, with the consent of all parties, an agreeable young lady, who was the only daughter of Mr. Lawsord, of Stapleton, near Bristol. She brought sir John a large real and personal estate; and for some time they were as happy a couple as ever entered into the conjugal state; 'till at length, some little jar∣ring happening between them, several per∣sons, as it is too common on such occasions, worked up sir John to a very great uneasiness. Lady Dineley's conduct was her protection, by which she triumphed over the malice of those who chiefly were instrumental in causing a variance between sir John and herself.</P>
<P>I will now enter upon that part of sir John's life which gave rise to those broils and con∣tentions that quite dissolved all the bonds of friendship and brotherly love between the Captain and him.—S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>muel Goodere, es{que} was another son of sir Edw. Goodere, and was likewise by his grandfather placed very early in the King's service, on board a man of war; and, on several occasions, behaved bravely. He was at the taking of St. Sebastian, Ferrol and St. Antonio; at which latter place he burnt three men of war, the magazines, and stores. Before he went to sea he was placed at Henley school by his grandfather, from whence, with some companions, he made an
<PB N="7" REF="8"/>
excursion to Charlton, robbed sir Edward Dineley's house, and clapped a pistol to his mother's breast, whose great indulgence to all her children was her only fault. Another instance is contained in a letter from Captain Goodere to his father: it was a demand for money, in order to supply some extravagant expences; and he acquainted him, if he would not comply with his request, it was his fixed resolution to wait on him in the country, and send a brace of bullets thro' his heart.—Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, in his early days, he had learned to contemn all laws, both divine and human.</P>
<P>We shall next consider the Captain's con∣duct as a brother.—Capt. Goodere had been in the service upwards of 20 years, and never attained to any higher post than a lieutenan∣cy of a man of war. This surprized every body, bec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>use sir Edw. Goodere h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it once in his power to obtain almost any favo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from the gentlemen in the administation. Whether the son's unhappy conduct had alienated <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e father's affections, or whether sir Edward's spirit would not permit him to solicit a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r for his own family, I cannot dete<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t capt. Goodere, 'till the year 1733, was but a lieutenant. The occasion of his prese<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt at last you will find as follows:—Ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lton, the seat of the Dineley <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amily, is s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tuate near the corporate town of Evesham; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or which reason, that family have always had a gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t influence upon the const<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>uents of that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o∣rough. Sir Edw. Goodere represented them in two or three parliaments. At the general election there were three candidates for that
<PB N="8" REF="9"/>
corporation. One of them imagined if he could reconcile sir Edward and his two sons to his interest he should be sure of carrying his point: upon this he immediately applied to the Captain, and told him, if he would do him that kind office, he should soon be made commander of a ship. Capt. Goodere swallowed the bait, and brought his father and brother to comply with the gentleman's request. Not long after capt. Goodere found that this great promiser had it not in his power to be as good as his word. This baulk, with a promise of the like nature from another of the candidates, induced the captain to turn sides. He likewise desired his father and bro∣ther to follow his example; but they rejected his requests, and, with a becoming scorn, assured him, they would never swerve from the interest they had once espoused. But this declaration had no other effect upon the Captain, than to make him a more obedient tool to his MASTER.</P>
<P>The two brothers stood candidates for the office of mayor the same year, and were both elected. This administered fresh cause of contention; but an action of the captain that followed this, was quite unp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdonable. The two Worshipfuls the sunday after the election, went, attended by the proper officers, to church. Sir John came first, and accordingly took possession of Mr. Mayor's seat. The Captain came in after the service was begun, and seeing his brother in the chair, ordered his servants to dethrone Mr. Mayor; which orders were execu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed; sir John was removed,
<PB N="9" REF="10"/>
and the Captain solemnly installed. This revolution disgusted sir John not a little; but he had prudence enough to stifle his resent∣ment; and, considering that it was neither a proper time nor place for wrangling, sat very contentedly in an humbler place, From this time an open declaration of war was made on both sides: whoever was a friend, or even a companion, to one, was looked on by the other as his most inveterate enemy. Sir Ed. Goodere declared himself on his eldest son's side, and refused to see his son Samuel for many years; but my mother, mrs. Foote, a daughter of sir Edw. Goodere, at last healed it up between the captain and his father.</P>
<P>After this difference was composed, the Captain concealed the rancour of his mind, and made professions of the great love he bore his brother, and how greatly the number of law suits sir John was engaged in afflicted him, and how readily he would contribute all his assistance towards extricating him out of these difficulties: but when sir Edward died, it was plain the Captain hated his brother as much as ever, but thought an open declaration of it, in his father's life time, might prejudice the views and expectations he had from him. The moment sir Edward expired, he plucked off the mask and appeared in his natural co∣lours. Sir John, upon the news of his father's illness, immediately set out for Burghope, and found, upon his arri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al there, no hopes of sir Edward's recovery: he therefore dis∣patched a messenger, to acquaint his brother with the affair, and desire his company: agree∣able
<PB N="10" REF="11"/>
to this message the Captain came to Burghope; not as an afflicted son. who came to pay his last sad offices to his father's me∣mory, but as an assassin and robber: for the moment sir Edward expired, the Captain at∣tacked his brother, and told him to depart the house, for both that and the e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ate were his, by virtue of a lease granted to him be∣fore his father's death. Upon this sir John shewed him sir Edw. Goodere's will, which gave the Herefordshire estate to sir John for his life, and after him to capt. Goodere and his heirs male <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d sir John Dineley's threatening to disinherit Capt, Goodere, in favour of his sister's son, John Foote, of Tru<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, in Cornwall, es{que} (brother to the late Samuel Foote, es{que}) has been generally thought to have been the cause of sir John's murder.—The aforesaid John Foote was heir to his uncle by will, and assumed the name of Dineley; but Mary Dineley Goodere, widow of fir John, holding the Charlton estate in dower, remarried with Mr. William Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ner, a printer, in White Fryars, London, who being thus in possession, did, by purchasing mr. Foote's right, become seised of the whole in see, and soon after sold it to Joseph Biddle, es{que} of Ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sham, whose executors sold it to messrs. Beesley, Socket, Lilly, and Bevington, of Worcester, in 1774. They obtained an act of parliament for enclosing the com∣mon fields, and othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wise much improved it at a considerable expence. It is said, that the above estate is since sold to others.</NOTE>. The Captain replied, the will was of no consequnce, because his deed
<PB N="11" REF="12"/>
was prior to it. On this sir John desired to see the lease; whlch capt. Goodere refused; and swore, if he did not turn out immediately he would call in six bull dogs he had at the door, that should soon make him repent his refusal. Upon this six stout fellows were in∣troduced, who it is supposed would have done sir John's business at that time, had not the Captain's wife, a worthy good lady, prevent∣ed them, by falling at her husband's feet, and with tears intreating him to desist from so rash an enterprise:—This gave sir John an op∣portunity to slip up stairs, where he laid hold on a blunderbuss, and threatening to shoot the first that attacked him, he made the Cap∣tain march off without effecting his design.</P>
<P>I can give very little information with re∣gard to the lease Capt. Goodere would have palmed upon his brother. Such a thing was indeed once proposed by the Captain to his father, but sir Edward was very angry with him, and would not listen to it. Yet grant∣ing Capt. Goodere had a lease, it was, ac∣cording to his own account, on such condi∣tions as could by no means be advantageous to him: he was to pay his brother the full rent of the estate, to have possession of the house, and to be at the expence of keeping the gardens in order. But admitting that the Captain might be a trifling gainer by it, it was certainly a very impolitic step to exas∣perate a brother, who, not a year before, had a large estate put in his power to give to whom he pleased. And this unavoidably
<PB N="12" REF="13"/>
leads me to mention something of the reco∣very which sir John, jointly with his son, suffered about a year besore.</P>
<P>Here it will be necessary to observe, that Capt. Goodere, about the time of his father's death, was forming a scheme to frustrate the design of the recovery, and render all the proceedings void. With this view he moved the court of Common Pleas against sir John Dineley, his attorney, and all the parties concerned in suffering the fine. The rule was obtained, by alledging that many flagrant frauds had been committed by the defendants: but, upon a full hearing; the affair was clear∣ed up greatly to their honour. As this oc∣currence has made a great noise, I shall men∣tion the particulars on which Capt. Goodere grounded his hopes, and leave the reader to form a Judgment on the equity of his pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>Sir John Dineley had one son by his lady, who was taken off almost in the morning of his days, through his libertine way of living. This young gentleman's ruin was in a great measure owing to the indulgence of his mo∣ther, the pernicious advice of bad company, and his running counter to all the admoni∣tions of his father. Neither was sir John entirely blameless, for he treated his son with the utmost indifference; and what heightened this ill treatment, was his putting the young gentleman apprentice to a sadler.</P>
<P>In this unhappy situation was poor Mr. Dineley, despised by all mankind, destitute
<PB N="13" REF="14"/>
of the necessaries of life, when his last sick∣ness attacked him. Considering in his ill∣ness into what a gulph of misery his own ill conduct had plunged him, he knew that, upon his recovery, a gaol must be his por∣tion. This horrid prospect prompted him to find out some scheme to evade the impen∣ding danger. There was but one way which he thought practicable; which was, to give his father, in confideration of an annuity and payment of his debts, the whole estate entailed upon him. This proposal he sent to sir John, who came to him, and, finding no danger would attend his removal, had him conveyed to his attorney's house in Fet∣ter Lanc. As Mr. Dineley was very weak, the recovery was immediately set about, and compleated two days before the young gen∣tleman's death.</P>
<P>When Capt. Goodere heard of this tran∣saction, he thought himself greatly injured, and resolved at all events to set aside the re∣covery. With this design the Captain set out for London, and made a strict scrutiny-into all the proceedings. After much search, he imagined he had detected a fraud which would crown all his hopes; and; elated with these thoughts, immediately commenced a suit against his brother. The foundation on which Captain Goodere grounded his assur∣ance of success was as follows: in the deed leading to the use of the recovery, Mr. Dineley had begun to write his name on the wrong side of the seal: the attorney stopped
<PB N="14" REF="15"/>
him when he had wrote about sour letters, and desired him to place his name on the other ssde: this he did in the presence of a great many credible witnesses. The Captain law this deed, and interpreted that part of it in the following manner. <Q>“It is true, this deed was drawn with my nephew's appro∣bation, and he was going to sign it, but expired before he could accomplish it; and then his father put the pen in his son's hand after he was dead, and signed it.”</Q> This was a bold assertion, and the pretence for it weak and shallow: no wonder then that the superstructure fell to pieces, since its foundation was so very feeble; though, to do the Captain justice, he left no s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>one unturned to inpport his cause, and all his actions loudly test<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rest of his family was his principal regard.—I shall trou∣ble the reader wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but one in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ance of his prudent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al care of his children.—One o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the principal evidences to the recovery was a woman, whose low circumstanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Captain Goodere imagined m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de it possi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le for her to res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>empt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of a bribe.

<P><PB N="15" REF="16"/>
I come now to the most shocking part of this narrative, which is the murder of my uncle Sir John Dineley Goodere; an event so barbarous and tragical, that I can scarce bear the thoughts of it; however, I here give the substance of the evidences and proofs that were made on the trial of Capt. Goodere.</P>

<P>THIS examinant voluntarily confesseth and saith, That he hath been a sailor on bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd the said ship for about 17 months last past. That about one o'clock in the night, on sunday last, the 18th inst. he was asleep in his hammock on board the said ship, and was cal∣led out by one Matthew M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony, another sailor on board the said ship, who told him, that the Captain (meaning Capt. S. Goodere, commander of sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d ship) wanted to speak with him in his cabin; and accordingly he went to him. The captain asked him to sit down, and gave him a wine glass of rum, and after that 4 or 5 more, and asked him, If he could kill a Spaniard? And this examinant answer'd. That he never did. On which the Capt. told him, He had a Job for him to do, if he would
<PB N="16" REF="17"/>
undertake it; and this examinant asked him, What job it was? and the Captain told him, It was to make away with his brother; whose name, as this examinant is informed, was sir John Dineley Goodere, bart. who was in the purser's cabin on board the said ship. And the said Matt. Mahony told this examinant, That he must go with him to help him to do it. Whereupon the said Capt. went out of the cabin first, Mahony followed him, and this examinant went next; and when he came to the purser's cabin door, where sir J. Dineley was, the Capt. was standing centinel himself at the door, with a cutlass in his hand, and Mahony had entered the cabin: And this examinant entered likewise, where M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony was talking with the said sir John, and had a piece of rope, called three quarter of an inch rope, in his hand, about six feet in length, and sir John lying on the bed: and, particu∣larly, Mahony asked sir John, How his head was, and what he had got about it? and, at last, told him, It did not signify talking about it any longer: and then fell on him on the bed, took hold of his throat with his hand, his stock being on, and so strangled him with his stock; and afterwards put the said rope about his neck, which was prepared on pur∣pose, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a noose in it, before <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was brought out of the Captain's cabin. And then Ma∣hony hauled the rope tight about his neck, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd upon this examinant's asking him, What he did that for? he answered, <Q>“For fear he should not be dead enough:”</Q> And this examinant took a kni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e out of his pocket,
<PB N="17" REF="18"/>
and cut it off, and threw it overboard; dur∣ing all which time the Captain stood centinel at the door, as aforesaid. And as soon as this examinant had cut the rope off, the Captain handed a candle to Mahony, who gave it to him; and Mahony took the watch and Money out of sir John's pockets; and then the Captain asked them. <Q>“Have you done?”</Q> meaning, as this examinant ap∣prehended, murdered the said sir John; and then came in himself. And this examinant went thro' the hold, and came upon deck, where he walked for about the space of half a quarter of an hour, and the Captain and Mahony went into the Captain's cabin to∣gether. Then this examinant went into the steerage, and Mahony c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled him into the cabin, where the Captain h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d undressed him∣self in order to go to bed, and there the Captain gave him five Guineas; and this examinant had received of the said Captain a six-and-thirty shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ling piece of gold, before the said sir John was murdered. And <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur∣ther this examinant saith, That Mahony shewed the watch he had taken out of sir John's pocket, and the Captain gave Maho∣ny his own watch, and kept sir John's him∣self; and Mahony likewise shewed the Cap∣tain the money, who bid him keep it; and Mahony gave it to this examinant, who put it into his pocket; And he and Mahony shared the money on the forecastle, and this examinant had two pieces to one, in consi∣deration that Mahony had the watch; and
<PB N="18" REF="19"/>
this examinant believes they shared about 30 l. between them. And further this exa¦minant saith, That the said Captain told him and Mahony, they might go any where for three weeks, and he would send them their Tickets. And lastly, this examinant faith, That between four and five o'clock in the same morning, when the man of war's yawl was coming to this city, he and Ma∣hony landed at the Gibb there.—C. WHITE.</P>

<P>THIS examinant confesseth and saith, That about 16 or 17 days ago, and several times since, he was desired by Mr. Goodere, captain of the Ruby man of war, to seize the said Captain's brother, sir John Dineley Goodere, bart. and bring him on board the said man of war: And that, on Tuesday last, this examinant and the crew belonging to the man of war's barge, and Edward M'Daniel, John M'Graree, and Wm. Hammond, privateer's men, were placed by the said Captain at the White Hart Ale∣house, opposite St. Augustine's church, in order to seize sir John Dineley that day; but it so happened that the Captain sorbad them to do it then: And that, on Sunday last, this
<PB N="19" REF="20"/>
examinant, the said barge's crew, or the greatest part of them, George Best, cock∣swain of the barge, the said Edw. M'Daniel, J. M'Graree, Wm. Hammond, and one Ch. Bryan, Privateer's men, were again placed at the White Hart aforesaid, to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eize the said s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r John Dineley Goodere, and waited there for some time, and he coming out of Mr. Jarrit Smith's house, and coming under St. Au∣gustine's church wall, this examinant and his comrades pursued him, and near the pump they came up with him, and told him, There was a gentleman wanted to speak with him; and he asked, Where the gentleman was? was answered, A little way off. And he went quietly a little way, but no one ap∣pearing, he res<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sted, and refused to go fur∣ther: whereupon this examinant and his comrades sometimes forcibly pushed and haul∣ed, and at other t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mes carried him, over St. Augustine's butts, capt. Day's rope walk, and along the road to the Hot Well, (capt. Goodere being sometimes a little behind, and sometimes amongst the croud, all the way) till they came to the Slip where the barge lay: But sir John was very unw<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lling to go, made the utmost resistance, and cried out murder a great many times; and when he was put into the barge, called out, and de∣sired somebody would go to mr. Jarrit Smith, and tell him of his ill usage, and that his name was sir John Dineley; whereupon the Captain clapped his hands upon sir John's mouth, to stop his speaking, and told him, not to make such a noise; he had got him
<PB N="20" REF="21"/>
our of the Lion's mouth (meaning the law∣yer's hands) and would take care he should not spend his estate, and bid the bargemen row away, which they did: And in their passage to the man of war, the two brothers bickered all the way; but when they came to the man of war, sir John went on bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rd as well as he could, and the Captain took him down to the Purser's c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bin, and stayed a lit∣tle time with him, and treated him with a dram of rum, and then left him for a con∣siderable time: <Q>And, in the interim, the Captain sent sor this examinantin to his cabin, and there told him, “He must murder his brother; for that he was mad, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould not live 'till four o'clock in the morning:”</Q> And this examinant reasoned with him, and told him he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ould not be concerned; and th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hought he had brought him there with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only to bring him to reason, and take c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re that he did not spend his estate in law, and to have a persect reconciliation; but the Captain still insisting th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, as this examinant had taken him, he should do it; and this examinant then saying, He was not able to do it of himself; the Captain replied, if this examinant could get No-body else, he and this examinant must do it themselves; and then ordered him to call on Elisha Cole: but he being too drunk to undertake such an affair the Captain bid this examinant call one Charles White, a very stout lusty fellow; the Captain gave him a dram, and bid him sit down, and soon after gave him other
<PB N="21" REF="22"/>
drams, and asked him, if he could fight, and told him, Here's madman, and he must be murdered, and thou shalt have a handsome reward. And this examinant, the said Char. White, and the Captain being all agreed to murder the said sir John Dineley; the Cap∣tain then proposed the method, and pro∣duced a piece of half-inch rope about nine feet long; and Charles White having made a noose in the rope, the Captain said, ap∣plying himself to this examinant and the said C. White, You must strangle him with this rope; and, at the same time, give the hand∣kerchief now produced, to stop his mouth in case he m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de a noife; and said, I will stand centinel over the door whilst you do it: and accordingly, that instant, went out of his cabin and turned the centinel from the Purser's cabin, where sir John Dineley was lying in his cloaths on a bed: The Captain having pulled to the door, and standing cen∣tinel himself, the said White first strangled sir John with his hands, and then put the rope about sir John's neck, and hauld it tight, and sir John struggled, and endevonred to cry out, but could not. And this exami∣nant confesses, that while White was strang∣ling sir John, this Examinant took care to keep him on the bed; and when one end of the rope was loose, he drew and held it tight; and thus each bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a part 'till sir John was dead: Then, having rifled the deceased of his watch and money, they knocked at
<PB N="22" REF="23"/>
the door to be let out; and the Captain cal∣led, Have ye done? They replying, Yes; he opened the door, and asked again, Is he dead! And being answered in the affirmative, and having a light, swore by G—d he'd be sure he was dead, and then went in himself; and returning, locked the door, and put the key in his pocket. And they all went to∣gether to the captain's cabin again, where this examinant gave the Captain sir John's watch, and the Captain gave him his own in lieu of it; and then the Captain gave them both some money, and White afterwards gave this examinant eight guineas, as part of the money he took out of the deceased poc∣ket: And then the Captain ordered them to be put on shore in his own bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t. And fur∣ther th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s examinant confesses and saith. That before the murder was committed, the Cap∣tain, White, and this examinant consulted what to do with the corpse; and the Captain proposed to keep it two or three days in the ship, and, as he expected to go to sea, they could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew it up in a hammock, and there throw it overboard. And that before this examinant and his comrades were sent to seize sir John, they were ordered by Captain Goodere, if they met with any resistance, to repel force by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orce, and were prepared with short heavy sticks, or bludgeons sor that purpose.</P>

<P>I Unfortunately got acquainted with Mat∣thew Mahony, a seman who belonged to the Ruby man of war, and in conversation with him, at my own lodgings, I and my comrades told him we had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nipped ourselves to go to Jamaica; at which he des<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red me not to go away 'till the Friday <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ollowing; for if we would but <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him in getting a man that was crazy into the man of war's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oat, he s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id the Captain would not only reward us with a bond of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but likewi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e protect us from the p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s; which occ<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d us on Tuesday to go <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee the Captain: But not finding him at his lodg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngs, went with the said Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ony to the sign of the White Hart, in the College Green, and, as the landlord told us, the Captain ordered us what liquors and v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctuals we pleased to call for. But we being afraid to go nigh the man of war's boat, acquainted the said M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony with our doubts, and he immediately informed the Captain thereof; wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> told us, to be under no dread, for it was not worth his while to lye in that man∣ner for three or four seamen; but he wanted to lay hold of a man who was a lunatic, and ruining himself, his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amily, and him the said Captain; and that he wanted him on board
<PB N="24" REF="25"/>
to keep him out of the lawyer's and affidavit men's hands; and promised that no harm should attend us on that account; and that he would not only give us a plentiful reward, but likewise protect us from all manner of press. That when the said gentleman came out of mr. Smith's house in the green, the Captain ordered us not to touch him, but to follow him, and see if he put up at any house <HI>in</HI> the city; which we did; but the gentle∣man continuing his journey without stopping we returned back; and, on our return, Ma∣hony went into the Coffee house near the Change, and spoke to the Captain, who told him we should have a better opportunity, and desired of us not to be out of the way. Accordingly we all met on the Sunday fol∣lowing, and waited in the Green 'till the gentleman came out of mr. Smith's, where he left the Captain behind him; and being encouraged by Mahony and others belong∣ing to the said Ship, we stopped him, and hauled him to the man of war's boat, being assisted by some of the crew. The Captain came prciently after us to the boat, where we left them, and returned to our lodgings, and staid there all night. In the morning fol∣lowing, before we were out of bed, Mahony and one Charles White came to out lodgings, and made us get up to drink punch, which we did; but seeing White have a quantity of gold, and Mahony have a gold watch, it made us imagine they had robbed the gentle∣man, and thereupon we went directly on board the man of war, to acquaint the Cap∣tain;
<PB N="25" REF="26"/>
but when we came on board we found the Captain a prisoner for assisting in the death of the gentleman, and the Lieutenant, knowing that we helped to bring him to the boat, ordered us to be confined, where we remained for eight-days, 'till the Mayor sent for us, who, after examining us, committed us to Newgate, where we now remain.</P>
<P>WM. HAMMOND, EDW. M'DANIEL, and CHARLES BRYAN.</P>
<P>Mr. HOBBS sworn.—Mr. Hobbs. On Monday, Jan. 12, 1740-1, the Captain (who was dressed in a scarlet cloak, with a sword by his side) and Mahony came to my house, and defiring to see an upper room, went up stairs, when the Captain looking out of the window, said to Mahony, Here's a fine pros∣pect of the tower, &amp;c. and then asbed, If he eould not breakfast in that room next morn∣ing at nsne o'clock, on a dish of coffee? But I endeavouring to recommend him to the coffee-house a little below, he replied, he liked the room (which presented to mr. Smith's house in the Green) and had much rather have his breakfast there than at the coffee-house, and insisted very much on it.—Then, after calling for a pint of ale for Ma∣hony, and paying for it, they both depart∣ed; the Captain telling me to mind the hour for his breakfast.</P>
<P>On Tuesday, about seven or eight o'clock, the Captain came by himself, drest in a drab coloured coat, with the cape buatoned clo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
<PB N="26" REF="27"/>
up under his hat, covering most of his face, insomuch that I did not know, for some time, that it was the same gentleman that was there the day before; and I was then making a fire in the room: The shutters of the windows not being open, he desired me to open them, which I did, and in the par∣lour, in which the Captain stood near half an hour, from whence he had a perfect view of mr. Jarrit Smith's house; (and this was the day mr. Smith speaks of, when s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r John promised to be with him to settle the loan, &amp;c.) That about the time the breakfast was got ready▪ Mahony and seven or eight more came in (amongst whom were M'Daniel, Hammond, and Bryan) when Mahony en∣quired if the Captain of the Man of war was there? And being told by me, that the gentleman who was with him the day before was there, (but whether he was the Captain of the Man of war he could not tell:) Ma∣hony desired to be admitted to him, with whom he stayed a considerable time; when the Captain ordered the men below to have what they would eat and drink, &amp;c. during which time Mahony often went up and down, and the others were often looking out, either at the door or at the window, towards mr. Smith's house; and after they had spent a considerable time there, Mahony calls out to the Posse, and shews them sir John's man, who was riding one horse and leading ano∣ther, before mr. Smith's door, with holsters and pistols to each, telling them, That is his fervant: Shortly after I saw a gentleman
<PB N="27" REF="28"/>
come out of mr. Smith's, and mount his horse; and, as he mounted his horse, I heard the Captain call to Mahony, telling him, That is he, look well at him, but do not touch him; on which they all went out, and Mahony and the rest returning about half an hour after, bespoke the same room for the Sunday following.</P>
<P>Accordingly on that day, Mahony, Mac Daniel, Hammond, and Bryan, with three or four others, came to the White Hart, and drank a considerable time; that all the time they were there, one or other was conti∣nually looking out towards mr. Smith's; that about five that evening sir John was seen coming out of mr. Smith's, with a velvet cap on, under a broad brim hat, who came down the hill by himself; at the sight of whom the ruffians rushed out, and the Cap∣tain was seen shortly to follow.—When it was that sir John was seized and kidnapped away, and afterwards murdered, will fully appe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r by other witnesses.</P>
<P>Council.—Call mr. Jones.</P>
<P>EDWARD JONES sworn.—Mr. Jones. On Sunday J<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n. 15, about seven at night, Capt. Goodere brought his brother sir John on board, and conveyed him down into the Purser's cabin by force. When he was down, the Captain asked, whether the cabin was clear (for on the Thursday before the Captain had ordered me to get the Purser's cabin ready for a gentleman who was to come on
<PB N="28" REF="29"/>
board.) I answered, Yes, sir. He then opened the door, and the people of the ship forced sir John in, he groaning all the while. That when he was in, the Captain called for his steward, and told him to bring a bottle of rum and a glass. That the Captain then asked sir John, How he did? Sir John com∣plained of pains, especially in his thigh. That the Captain asked him, If he would drink a dram? Sir John said, He had drank nothing but water these two years. That the Captain then asked him, If he would have any rum to bathe his thigh? Sir John an∣swered. No. That the Captain ordered a dram for Mahony and Elisha Cole; and after they had had a dram, they all came out of the cabin. That then Cole defired Leave to speak to the gentleman [sir John], thinking he was the Captain of the ship he was pressed out of. That Cole went in, and told sir John, He did his duty on board the Charles as well as another man, and swore he would have his wages, Sir John told him. He did not know him, or any thing of the Charles: On which he again swore. He'd have his wages before he went out of the ship; for that. if he was not the Captain, he was the Owner. Soon after Cole went out, and the Captain called one of the carpenters to put two strong bolts on the Purser's cabin door, which was accord∣ingly done. That about this time, sir John asked▪ If he could speak to any of the offi∣cers on board. That the carpenter answered. I am the carpenter. Sir John asked, If he
<PB N="29" REF="30"/>
could speak a word with him? He replied, An hundred, if he pleafed. That the car∣penter opening the door, in order to clench the staples, sir John asked me, What his bro∣ther Sam was going to do with him; What is he going to murder me? I replied, No; he is willing to have your company, sir; he does it for your good. But sir John said, What will become of my servants and estate all this time? On this I retired, and presently the Capt in came down again, and ordered the Doctor's first mate to feel his pulse, saying, We must patch him up as well as we can; he is a crazy old fellow, go in and feel his pulse. Accordingly the Doctor went in, and, when he came to sir John, he asked him, Where his pains were? He answered, He lately came from Bath, and had a pain in his head; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omplained of many other pains occa∣sioned by the rough usage in bringing him on board. Says the Captain, Doctor, feel his pulse, and come out. So accordingly the Doctor came out, and the cabin door was shut. After this I heard him praying for God to be comfortable to him in his afflic∣tions, for that he believed he was going to be murdered; and hoped it would be brought to light, for that it was impossible it could be done without somebody hearing or seeing it. About nine o'clock at night I heard him knocking and calling out, Ho! ho! brother sailors! (I have almost forgot my sea-terms) let me have a bucket to p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss in and ease my∣self, for it will be a shame to do if in the
<PB N="30" REF="31"/>
cabin. Then I looked out at the cabin door, and called to the centry to get something for the gentleman to ease himself in. Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntly after Mahony came with the bucket; when sir John told him of his exploits, and that he had been Captain of an Indiaman, &amp;c. About two or three o'clock in the morning, my wise waked me; when I heard a vast struggling at first, and the old gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n cried out, Twenty guineas! Take it! Take it! Must I die! Must I die! and very soon after all was quiet: Then a candle was handed into the cab<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and I saw, thro' the crevice of the partition, Mahony hold the candle in his hand, &amp; White plundered his pockets, turning his body in order to come at it, and took out of his poc∣kets his watch and money; and White not getting the watch out of sir John's pocket, Mahony said to him, D—n it, lay hold of the chain; and it was some time before they got the watch out of his pocket, being forced at last to unbutton his breeches. White put his hand into one pocket and found nothing but silver, and putting his hand into the other, said, Here it is! Then he put his hand into another pocket and found a piece of paper, which he was going to read, but that Mahony damned him, bid∣ding him put it in his pocket, and not stand to read it now; and in about a minute after, I saw a white hand on the throat of the de∣ceased, which I took to be the captain's; and presently they all went out of the cabin, and left the deceased alone. I then went to the doctor's mate and the centry, and, by their
<PB N="31" REF="32"/>
opinion, we took the gentleman to be dead. Then I went to the lieutenant, and told him what I had seen and heard, and that Maho∣ny and White had murder<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the gentleman, and that I believed the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptain was concern∣ed. The lieutenant was very dubious of the truth at first, telling me, he did not think the Captain would be guilty of any such thing; but on my giving him such plain demonstrations of the fact, he began to think there was something in it. While we were talking, the midshipman came to acqua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt the lieutenant, that the Captain had order'd Mahony and White ashore; then he swore they should not go, for they were the two persons that had killed the gentleman: but the midshipman returning to the captain, he ordered they should be put ashore imme∣diately, and accordingly they were.</P>
<P>About nine or ten in the morning, the lieutenant and gunner contrived that I should go in, and complain I had lost six guineas out of my chest; and going with this com∣plaint. I seized the captain as he was walking with his hands behind him, and the rest, who were at hand, rushed in after me. The Captain being thus seized, he cried out, Hay! Hay! What have I done?—Upon which I replied, Sir, you are my prisoner; you was the cause of your Brothers death last night. Then the captain said, If there is murder done in the ship I know nothing of it. Ac∣cordingly he was secured, and the barge or∣dered out, for four of the crew to pursue White and Mahony. They took White at

the Bell, in Marsh street, (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>wearing and damning his mother for sending him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o much money,) very much in liquor. He w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s soon conquered, and brought before a mag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>strate; but was so drunk that his confession was not taken 'till next morning.—A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>out twelve at night they took Mahony at a private house opposite the Ship, on St. Mi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hael's Hill Steps, and conveyed him before a magistrate, and when he was sober, he also m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de his confession of the murder.</P>

<P>Mrs. Jones. On sunday the 18th of Jan. 1740-1, somebody came down, and the Cap∣tain asked, If the cabin was clean? biding them bring the old mad fellow in. Then he called for the doctor, and told him, He had got an old mad fellow there, and that he must doctor him as well as he could. Then they went into the cabin, when the Captain asked his brother, How he did now? Sir John told him; He had a great pain in his arms and thighs by the men's hauling him down to the boat. Then the captain asked him, If would drink a dram? Sir John told him, No; for he had dra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> nothing but water the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e two years. Then the captain said he <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould have something to anoint his thigh, and called for the stewaed to bring a bottle of Rum; when the captain again asked his brother, If he would drink? who answered, No. On which the captain said, it is much
<PB N="33" REF="34"/>
the better for you. And, at this time, she perceived there was in the cabin one Elisha Cole, whom the captain ordered a dram for, and bid him sit down. Sir John still com∣plaining of his legs and arms, the captain ordered Mahony to pull his stockings off: on which sir John said, Do not strip me before I am dead. Then the captain made answer, Do not mind him, for he is crazy.—Says sir John to his brother, Brother S<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, what do you bring me here for? You cannot murder me without letting somebody know of it: telling him several times, he would rot in a gaol for it. That then the captain went to the doctor's mate, and sent him to feel his pulse; but charged him not to talk to him much. That in obedience to the captain's command, the doctor went to sir John, and felt his pulse, and sir John told him, He had a great pain in his head; that he had been a week at Bath, since which his head was worse than ever. Then the captain went up to supper; mean while the carpenter came to put two bolts on the cabin door; when sir John asked M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony (who was constantly to and sro,) If he could speak with one of the officers? Mahony told him, They were all on Shore except the carpenter, and he was nailing on the bolts. On this sir John asked, If he was going to be nailed in? M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony replied, No, sir: then, says sir John, I de∣sire to speak with the carpenter. That on this Mahony went out of the cabin, but neglected to acquaint the carpenter of it; so sir John called the carpenter himself, and
<PB N="34" REF="35"/>
asked him. If he pleased to hear him speak one word? The carpenter replied, Aye, twenty, if you please, sir. That then he asked the carpenter, What his Brother meant by bringing him there? The carpenter re∣plied, He hoped it was for his good: Sir John made answer, But what will my servants and my estates do the while? I suppose my brother tells you I am a madman; but I am not; though he is enough to drive me m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d: on which the carpenter went out. That about ten o'clock, the captain came down again with a pair of stockings in his hand, and asked his brother, If he would put them on? sir John told him, No; he would 'bide as he was. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t at this time sir John did not talk much, but told his brother, He would rot in a gaol. On this the captain bid Mahony see if he h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d any k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fe about him; when sir John took a little knife out of his pocket, and gave it to M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hony, and went and laid himself on the bed directly: then the captain went out, and spoke aload, and ch<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rged (I suppose the centry) that no one should come near him; for that by and by he would kick and tear, and make a noise as though he would tear the cabin down: for he was a madman.—That then the captain went out again, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at in the doctor's birth, saying to mr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h, the mid hipman, You must go ashore in the morning between three and four o'clock: and also ordered him to go to the post-office for the letters; and if any body made enquiry for the old mad fellow, he should tell them, That he had taken him
<PB N="35" REF="36"/>
on board to prevent his rotting in a gaol: in short, continued he, the world has blam'd me that I have not done it be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore.—That about twelve, sir John asked Mahony for the knife, saying, What, does my brother think I am going to make away with myself? God forbid! The world is bad enough to do it: telling Mahony, It was his deceased son's knife and that he would have it again. And after he had talked to him sometime, he bid him go out, for he could '<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>de by himself. That Mahony said to him, Sir, I must bide and t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of you <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mediately put the candle out. Sir John still kept talking to Mahony, praying to God to give him patience: and Mahony told him, He must have patience. Sir John replied, sighing, I had as good. Then s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r John <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id to Ma∣hony, If a great many gentlemen <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Bristol did but know how he was used, they would <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him from thence: on which Mahony told him, He should go ashore in the morn∣ing, and that then he would convey any let∣ters to the post-office, if he pleased.—That, some time after two, she happened to awake, when s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e heard Mahony persuading sir John to go to sleep. That sir John and he kept talking for some time, when, on a sudden, she heard a great strugling, and two people whispering in the cabin, and sir John groan∣ing and m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>king a lamentable noise, mutter∣ing out, Murder! Help, for God's sake! giving several kecks with his throat.

said, Keep out you Negro; or, Keep the door too, you Negro That while that person was at the door, fir John said, Here's Twenty guineas for you! Take it! Take it! Must I die! Must I die! Between the words he gave several kecks, and spoke inwardly, Oh, my life! Which were the last words he spoke. That some time after a light was brought in, which she saw in Mahony's hand: then she saw a man trying to pull sir John upon his back, his face lying towards the boards; and saw White pull his face, in order to come at his pocket; when Mahony said, D—mn it, pull his watch out. The person replied, He could not. Then Mahony told him to pull it out by the chain. That then she said to her husband, The gentleman is dead, for they are robbing him: on which her husband got up, and looked thro' the crevice of the par∣tition; her fight being intercepted by him, she could not see the watch drawn out of the pocket, tho' she afterwards saw White give it Mahony, bidding him put it in his pocket. Presently after; she heard one say, Here's no∣thing but silver! Then she heard him say, Here's the gold! Hearing no more of them in the cabin, she heard them go out, bolt &amp; lock the door. Several words were spoken when they went out, which she did not understand, only Mahony said, in a flutter, Which way shall I go? The other answer'd, (who was White by his voice) Follow me, my boy! and they went off. Which is all I know of the matter, an't please your Lordship.</P>

Court. Call another witness.—[Duncan Buchanan sworn.]</P>
<P>D. Buchanan. On Jan. 13, 1740-1, the captain ordered the barge and yawl up (meach of which was a midshipman) and ordered a midshipman and six of the bargemen to go to the White Hart, the Foot of the College green. That when they came there, they saw the Captain, Mahony, and five of the Privateer's, who were drinking hot Flip in a room by themselves, whilst himself and the five bargemen were sitting in the public kit∣chen drinking of ale. That shortly after he saw sir John come from mr. Smith's, opposite the White Hart, where his man was waiting for him, with pistols to each of their horses: That the Privateer's men seeing him, they rushed out together, and were for seizing sir John then; but the Captain ordered them not to touch him at that time, but to follow him, and see which way he went. That they followed him round the corner, and the Cap∣tain after them; but the captain returned to the White Hart again in about an hour, and ordered the boat down.—That on the sun∣day following, the same gentleman he saw in the Green was brought on board the Ruby: That as he was bringing on board, the Capt. bid the people not mind what he said, for he was a madman; but he would bring him to his senses by and by. That he saw no more of him at that time. That at twelve o'clock he was placed centry over sir John, and a little after the Capt. sent his man for him:
<PB N="38" REF="40"/>
That he gave the centry at the gun-room charge, that nobody should come down the ladder 'till he had spoke with the Captain. That when he went into the Captain's cabin, he saw the Captain and Mahony with a bottle of Rum and a glass before them, out of which he had a dram. That the Captain asked him, If his brother made any noise? On which he told him, That he made a little moan the time he was there. The Captain replied, I know the reason of that, he wants to be shifted: I will come down and shift him with dry stockings presently. That when he went out, the C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ptain told him to let nobody into the cabin to sir John but Mahony. Says Mahony, You may let ano∣ther go, because—here he stopped. About two, the Captain came down, and asked him, If his brother made any noise? and listened himself at the cabin door. Then the Capt. said to him, Centry, give me the sword, and you go upon deck; because I want to talk to my brother privately: That accordingly he gave him the sword, and went up into the gun-room, and there walked. That a little while after down came Mahony, and the Centry asked, Where he was going? He said, D—n you, you dog, what is that to you? D—n you, how busy you make yourself! That then Mahony went down into the cock∣plt, and so into the Purser's cabin. That soon after, he heard sir John mutter out, Murder! Then every thing was quiet for a little while, and the Captain took the lan∣thorn
<PB N="39" REF="41"/>
that was hanging up, and gave it into the cabin himself. That seeing the candle given into the cabin, he thought it not pro∣per for the Captain to stand without a light, and therefore lighted a candle in the gun∣room, and was going down into the cockpit, where the Captain was standing with a sword in his hand; but on his approach the Capt. held the sword to his breast, saying, Stay where you are, That accordingly he went back, and walked for a small time in the gun∣room: That the Captain came to the foot of the ladder with the candle out, telling him to light it and come down: which he accordingly did. Then the Captain gave him the sword, and bid him take his post; locking and bolting the cabin door, and put∣ting the key in his pocket (which before the murder was left in the door;) telling him, If he heard his brother make any more noise, to send to him and let him know it.</P>
<P>Theodore Cote, master of the Ruby, de∣clar'd, He saw the gentleman brought on board, and the ship was then in King's Road. That in the morning the Captain sent for him, and told him, he had an order from the Ad∣miralty to go to sea, though he did not care if he got no farther than the Holmes; and asked him, If there was good anchoring ground there? Mr. Cote replied, There was no such thing as anchoring there. The Captain insisted very much on going, but I told him, The ship was an old tattered vessel,
<PB N="40" REF="42"/>
and that he must go against wind and tide: So I did not care to venture to move the ship from where she was.</P>
<Q>[Then there arose a dispute, whether the Ship was really in the Liberties of the city and county of Bristol; the Captain endeavouring to prove, that she rode a good way up the Severn. But several of the oldest officers being sworn, and deposing that they had for many years ser∣ved Processes out of the courts of Bristol and Westminster in King's Road, it proved a sufficient pre∣cedent to confirm the authority of the Court.]</Q>
<P>Mr. Williams swore, That he steered the Barge sir John was carried down in, and heard a great deal of talk, the substance of which is before recited by the other Evidence; particularly that part of it, where sir John advised the Captain, after he had murdered him to go and hang himself, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. Weller, the carpenter, proved that he put the bolts upon the Purser's cabin door, by the Captain's order, whilst sir John was in the cabin.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="43"/>
William M'Ginnis swore, That he saw the Captain stand at the Purser's cabin door, at the time of the murder, with a drawn sword in his hand; and that when he offered to draw near him, the Captain held up his sword, and bid him keep back.</P>
<P>Mr. Duggen, doctor's mate, That the Captain ordered him into the cabin to seel the gentleman's pulse, and that he acquaint∣ed the Captain that his pulse was regular.</P>
<P>The Captain in his defence pleaded the ut∣most innocence; alledging, That could it be thought he could be guilty of the murder of his brother, whereas by his death he lost at least 40,00 l.?—That fickness and dis∣order in the prison, debarred him of his law∣yer and friends conversing with him.—That he applied to the Captain of the Ruby as soon as he was allowed pen, ink, and paper, for his evidences on ship board (which were lieutenant Perry; the doctor; mr. Robert Haythorn, mr. Richard Wilson, and Hugh Discal:)—That he applied to the lords of the admiralty, who sent him an order, but that the ship sailed the day before it arrived: which debarred him of justifying himself, they being material evidences:—That the News Papers being full of reflecting false expressions, was a great detriment to him:—Then he urged (in a low speech) That his prosecutors would set easy in the birth right of his innocent children, should he be convicted:—In vindication of seizing sir John in that manner, he urge<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, That he
<PB N="42" REF="44"/>
was a lunatic, and therefore he did it to take care of him:—That his being taken in the day-time on board, was plain there was no secret design, nor harm infended to come to him:—And that when he parted with him at mr. Smith's, he behaved in a very mad manner, and took no leave <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Friend to both of them, at Bristol, who knew their mortal antipathy invited them once to dinner, in hopes to reconcile them, and says, That they parted that evening in seeming Friend∣ship.—Captain Goodere's son, who was heir to the Title, but being young at the untimely death of his father, did, when he was grown up, take the name of sir John Dineley Goodere, and afterwards litigated with divers persons for part of the patrimony of his father and uncle, and soon spent what small share he recovered by it.—He afterwards went to Scotland, and studied phy∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ic there, becoming an <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinerant doctor, where he is now living: at his decease the Dineley and Goodere's family will be quite extinct</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In order to prove sir John a lunatic, he called upon mrs. Gethens, to signify, That he had intimated to her some time before his intention of securing sir John as a luna∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c; and that he proposed to her to have a g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rret for air, and other conveniencies; and that Mahony was to attend him, and to have five shillings a week for his pains:—[Though mrs. Gethens, when called on, declared she knew nothing of Mahony, nor of any such bargain.]—That the people
<PB N="43" REF="45"/>
on board knew of his coming a week before he came, to prevent his running out the estate; therefore, he intimated, that he must be very silly to bring a person to three hun∣dred evidences to commit a vile act, where nathing can be kept a Secret above four hours.</P>
<P>The Captain likewise brought two young women to prove sir John a lunatic; one of whom said, She believed him to be mad, because he would get up in the middle of the night and disturb all the servants: That sometimes he would busy himself in hanging on the pot, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A Gentleman was called by Captain Good<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re to his character; when being ask∣ed, Whether he knew sir John to be any way mad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or the like; decla<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, That he was so f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r from being a lunatic, that he had more sense than the whole family.—Sir John was also proved by mr. Smith to be in his perfect sense<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the hour before he was hurried away.</P>
<P>The evidence for the king being clear and sull, the Jury, after a trial of nine hours, brought in their verdict, That the prisoners were all GUILTY.</P>

<HEAD>An ACCOUNT of Capt. GOODERE's Behaviour aster Sentence of Death.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN he returned to Newgate, he went on foot, with a scarlet cloak on, and, as he passed along the streets, he was very particular in making his obeisance to the gentry and others of his acquaintance. After which his lady, who bears the charac∣ter of a worthy gentlewoman, spared no pains for his life, and petitioned that his sentence of death might be mitigated, or else changed into transportation or imprisonment. But she not having success in her application for mercy, his Friends desired him to turn his thoughts upon eternity. for that there was no hope of any favour from the higher pow∣ers. <Q>And on the 8th of April, as a Me∣mento Mori, his coffin was carried into his apartment in the gaol, with this inscription, “SAMUEL GOODERE, aged 53 years, who departed this life, April 15, 1741;”</Q> at the sight of which he was very much cast
<PB N="45" REF="47"/>
down, and became sorrowful; and then the rev. mr. Weston, curate of St. Peter's, and mr. Penrose, rector of St. Wasbrose, two worthy and learned divines, were desired to attend him, and prepare him for another world. They seriously pressed him to the acknowledgment of his crime; but he per∣sisted that he had no intention to murder his brother, but only to bring him from those meafures he was pursuing, so highly inju∣rious to the family.</P>
<P>Several Sermons were preached to him to bring him to a sense of religion; and the sunday before he died, the rev. mr. Rogers, rector of St. Peter's and Ocle, in Hereford∣shire, and an intimate friend of his, preach∣ed from the following words: <Q>“For if we believe that Jesus died, and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. I. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hess. iv. 14.”</Q> Which was done in such a pathe∣tic manner, that it drew tears from his eyes and most of his audience.</P>
<P>At length these gentlemen, by the power and grace of their admonitions, so molified his heart, that at last they prevailed over him, (being terrified with God's justice, and encouraged by his mercies) and with tears and groans he confessed the murder of his brother, and bitterly repented it; thanking those godly divines for their charity, care, and zeal for his soul, and besought them to pray to the Lord to forgive him and receive him into his blest abodes. And then he
<PB N="46" REF="48"/>
spent most of his time in prayer, singing of psalms, reading, meditation, and good dis∣courses: his thoughts being wholly taken up with preparations to die: And it is hoped, that through the blessing of God and the charitable assistance of these pious men, he was brought to a true repentance and abhor∣rence of his atrocious crime.</P>
<P>Some days before he died, he earnestly desired to partake of the Lord's Supper; but the minister told him, he could not comply with his request, until he had openly confessed his crime, and declared himself to have truly repented of it.</P>
<P>He appeared very sorrowful, and could not refrain from tears, when he thought of his brother: His ingratitude to him, and the disgrace brought on his family, present∣ed themselwes alternately to his tortured mind, which gave him much uneasiness, and added to the agonies of his approaching end. He prayed for forgiveness of God, and that mankind might learn, from his example, to restrain their passion, and not suffer themselves to be carried beyond the bounds of reason and humanity. He was much concerned he had not a more favour∣able sentence passed upon him, or at least, to die like a gentleman; but, at the same time, reflecting on his crimes, he acknowledged the justice of the decree which the court had passed on him: And before he died, he took the sacrament with his lady, who de∣parted
<PB N="47" REF="49"/>
out of the city of Bristol immediately afterwards.</P>
<P>On Wednesday the 15th day of April, 1741, about eleven o'clock in the forenoon, captain Goodere was conveyed in a mourn∣ing chariot, through the greatest croud as ever was known in Bristol. An infinite number of people of all ranks were assem∣bled at St. Michael's Hill, which was the plaee appointed for his and his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ellow suf∣ferers execution, to see them take their last farewell of this world; when the captain behaved with a becoming decency, and the tranquility of a sens<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble man and a true penitent.</P>
<P>After some private discourse with mr. Pen∣rose, he confessed the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me, and that it was the justice of God that he should under∣go th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t ignominous death; he besought the spectators to pray for his soul; he lamented his cruelty to his brother, and said, that his brother's cutting off the entail of the estate, to the prejudice of his family, had carried his re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entment beyond reason, and thereby brought him to this shameful end; he ex∣horted them to take example by him; and solemnly freed his lady, and other relations, from being any way accessary, or acquainted with his intention to murder his brother. He then joined in prayers with mr. Penrose, and, after having sung a psalm, he embrac∣ed and thanked the minister for his offices in his behalf; and, in a most tender manner,
<PB N="48" REF="50"/>
took leave of his acquaintance about him; and was heard to say, at several different times, Lord do not reward me according to my deserts.</P>
<P>When he came to the fatal tree, and saw Mahony and White, he embraced them with very great tenderness, and was much grieved to think he was the means of bring∣ing them to that untimely end. And, ac∣cording to his desire, when he dropped his handkerchief, which was the fignal, he was turned off; whilst many of the specta∣tors sent up their prayers and good wishes for his eternal welfare.</P>
<P>After he had hung above an hour and a quarter he was cut down, and his corpse was carried in a hearse back to Newgate, and it lay there all night, by order of the ma∣gistrates, in order to prevent any art being made u<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e of to bring him to life; and the next day he was carried in a hearse, with six horses, to be buried in Hereford amongst his Ancestors.</P>
