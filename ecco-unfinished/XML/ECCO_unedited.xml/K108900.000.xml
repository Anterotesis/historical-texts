<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Sneering.)</STAGE>
<P>A Lawyer! No one to see you in this Trim, would imagine you had ever carried a Cause in any Body's Suit but your own—had you a grain of Spirit left, you might—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Spirit! Nay, nay, Wife, don't complain of my want of Spirit; Was it not my Spirit that drove me from the Capital, and make me bury my Talents in Obscurity? Have not I attended all the Harangues of the Courts with only a little Whizzing on one side, and a Deafness on the other? And have not I con∣vinced you I had too much Spirit on a certain Oc∣casion?—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very fine indeed,—And so you make a Merit of your Blunders.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Blunders, indeed!—I think I made a Blun∣der in coming here—Not a single Job have I got since I have been down; not a broken Head, nor a Quarrel for one to get a Penny by—there has not been a Bastard born since we have been here! And, Damn me, if I don't think the very Cattle keep out of the Pound on purpose to spite me. Now, if one could put on the Appearance of Business, the Rea∣lity will follow of Course, and perhaps something may turn out.—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and in the mean Time, your poor Wife may starve, and your Daughter lose the Opportunity of settling herself handsomely with one of the young Men that pay their Addresses to her; which the Shabbiness of your Appearance has fright∣ened away.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, to be sure, I am Shabby enough of all Conscience, and cannot with any Propriety make my Appearance in Public.—Let me see—I have it—I'll go and purchase a Suit of Clothes directly.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Purchase a Suit of Clothes without a Shilling in your Pocket?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, my Dear, that's nothing at all: most of the fashionable Suits in London are purchas∣ed that way. Let me see—what Colour shall I chuse? shall it be a Brown—a Grey—a Bat's-wing—or—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! never mind the Colour, so you can only find somebody Fool enough to let you have the Cloth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, I'll warrant you. Let me see now—There's Neighbour Snarl now, that lives over the Way, he keeps a large Assortment of Colours, I'll hum him out of a Suit.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mr. Snarl!—take care what you do there, Husband; his Son, Charles, is in Love with our Harriot, and would have married her before now, but for fear of his Father's Anger—I would not for the World disappoint the Girl's hopes.</P>

<SP>

<P>No, Sir, I think you have got a very good one.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No such Thing—I tell you that Sheep∣face is a Rogue—Here he has lived with me only a Fortnight, and there are missing Fourteen of my best Weathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>Consider, Sir, what Havock such a Dis∣order makes in a little Time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Yes,—I have considered—and I know pretty well by this Time. I have long suspected him—and last Night I caught him in the very Fact, killing one of my fattest Weathers; and am de∣termined to have him up before Justice Mittimus this Day—but reach me my Book, and let me look over the Account of my Flock, perhaps there may be more Missing.</P>

<P>Only to tell you, I've been with Neigh∣bour Gripe, the Constable, who has been speaking to me about Sheep-stealing, Justice Mittimus, your Honour, and a power of Things—so I said to my∣self, as how I would not make it a Secret any longer with your good Workship.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why! Fellow! this affected Simplicity won't serve your Purpose.—Did not I catch you last Night killing one of my fattest Weathers.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheepface.</SPEAKER>
<P>Only to keep it from Dying, by my Feckins.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>the Doctor, ha! the Doctors have a Li∣sence to kill from the College, but you have none, I believe. Why! there was not such a Breed in all the Kingdom for Spanish Wool!</P>

<P>Please your Worship, satisfy yourself with the Blows you gave me, and make Matters up, if it be your Worship's good Will and Pleasure.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>But 'tis not my good Will and Pleasure—my good Will and Pleasure is to see you hanged, you Rascal.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sheepface.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! no; don't hang me!—consider that would be the Death of me! besides, your Worship, I was only married Yesterday—leave me alone for a Week or two, and who knows, but by that Time, I may save your Worship the Trouble.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, no, the Gallows will be the best Way at first, and every bit as sure.</P>

<P>Very true, Sir, very true; when would you like to receive this Money? for I am impatient to pay every body.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, when you please.—No Time like the Time present.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Scout.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very true; I have it told out at home; but as I only hold my Father's Effects in Trust for my Daughter Harriot, for Form sake, you know it will be proper to have some of the other Guardians present at the Time of Payment.</P>

<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>

<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Very. It's my favourite Dish.</P>

<P>Pretty well; I can't complain.</P>

<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, Sir, you slatter me!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Snarl.</SPEAKER>
