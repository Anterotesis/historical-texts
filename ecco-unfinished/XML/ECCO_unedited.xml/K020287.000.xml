<P>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE JOHN HELY HUTCHINSON, PRIME SERJEANT AT LAW, AND ONE OF HIS MAJESTY'S MOST HONOURABLE PRIVY COUNCIL OF THE KINGDOM OF IRELAND, THIS COMEDY IS INSCRIBED BY HIS MOST OBLIGED AND MOST DEVOTED HUMBLE SERVANT, GEORGE COLMAN.</P>

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE fate of this little comedy, on its first appear∣ance, was extremely singular. After having been very favourably received the two first nights, a violent attempt was made to prevent its exhibition on the third. The pretence for this determined condemnation of the piece was, that it contained not only personal, but even national, reflections. The author had the greatest abhorrence of both. The piece was written several years ago; the very names of the persons who supposed themselves aggrieved, were unknown to him; and so far from intending to cast an illiberal reflection on the Irish nation, it was evidently his main design to vindi∣cate the gentlemen of that country from the reproach deservedly incurred by worthless adventurers and out∣casts. The gentlemen of Ireland appeared the foremost in his defence. The author is truly sensible of their candour on this occasion, and is so conscious of the pu∣rity of his own intentions, which he doubts not will appear on the perusal of the piece, that he has ven∣tured to inscribe it to one of the most eminent charac∣ters of that kingdom.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. WOODWARD, in the Character of a Gentleman-Commoner.</HEAD>
<L>FRESH from the Schools, behold an Oxford Smart!</L>
<L>No Dupe to Science, no dull Slave of Art.</L>
<L>As to our Dress, faith Ladies, to say truth,</L>
<L>It is a little aukward and uncouth.</L>
<L>No Sword, Cockade, to lure you to our Arms—</L>
<L>But then this airy Tassel has its Charms.</L>
<L>What mortal Oxford Laundress can withstand</L>
<L>This, and the Graces of a well-starch'd Band?</L>
<L>In this Array, our Spark, with winning Air,</L>
<L>Boldly accosts the froth-compelling Fair:</L>
<L>Fast by the Tub with folded Arms he stands,</L>
<L>And sees his Surplice whiten in her Hands;</L>
<L>And as she dives into the scapy Floods,</L>
<L>Wishes almost himself were in the Suds.</L>
<L>Sometimes the Car be drives impetuous on,</L>
<L>Cut, lash, and slash, a very Phaeton!</L>
<L>Swift as the fiery Coursers of the Sun,</L>
<L>Up Hill and down his raw-bon'd Hackneys run.</L>
<L>Leaving, with Heat half dead, with Dust half blind,</L>
<L>Turnpikes, and bawling Hosts, unpaid behind.</L>
<L>You think perhaps we read—perhaps we may,</L>
<L>The News, a Pamphlet, or the last new Play:</L>
<L>But for the Scribblers of th' Augustan age,</L>
<L>Horace, and such queer Mortals, not a Page.</L>
<L><PB REF="5"/>His brilliant sterling Wit we justly hold</L>
<L>More brilliant far transform'd to sterling Gold.</L>
<L>Tough Euclid we digest without much Pain,</L>
<L>And solve his Problems into brisk Champagne.</L>
<L>Fir'd with this Juice—why let the Proctor come,</L>
<L>"Young Men 'tis late—'tis time you were at home."</L>
<L>"Zounds! are you here, we cry, with your dull Rules,</L>
<L>Like Banquo's Ghost, <HI>to push us from our Stools?</HI>"</L>
<L>Such are the Studies Smarts pursue at College—</L>
<L>O! we are great Proficients in such Knowledge.</L>
<L>But now no more from Classick Fields to glean,</L>
<L>The Muse to Covent-Garden shifts the Scene.</L>
<L>There shall I enter next, sans Cap and Gown,</L>
<L>And play my Part on this Great Stage, <HI>the Town</HI>.</L>
<STAGE><HI>Bows, and going, returns.</HI></STAGE>
<L>Soft ye, a Word or two before I go—</L>
<L>Our Piece is call'd a <HI>Comedy</HI> you know;</L>
<L>A Two-act Comedy: tho' Rome enacts,</L>
<L>That every Comedy be just Five Acts.</L>
<L>Hence, parent Dulness the vain Title begs</L>
<L>For squalling, dancing Monsters on five Legs.</L>
<L>The Bantling of To-night, if rear'd by you,</L>
<L>Shall run, like Men and Women, upon two.</L>

<SPEAKER>CARELESS.</SPEAKER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ELL, once more welcome to Lon∣don! Welcome, for a short week at least, days of ease and nights of plea∣sure! What? In the dumps, Charles? Prithee, throw off that musty col∣lege countenance. You breathe the air of dear Covent-Garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Carel.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>So much the worse? So much the bet∣ter, you mean, Charles. Is not this chearful square beyond the doll gloom of a melancholy
<PB N="2" REF="8"/>
quadrangle? and the gay appearance of every one you meet, a more pleasing sight, than a few so∣lemn faces in starched bands and grizel wigs? But what can be the matter with you? I never knew you quarrel with jollity before. You were fretful and out of humour all the way upon the road; but there your unaccountable gravity only lulled us to sleep; but now, in the name of all that's happy and chearful, awake, man! and be the same jovial airy <HI>Knowell</HI> you used to be.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Frank, that I am as fond of jollity as you are: but I must own, that our pre∣sent excursion, and our late frequent journies to town, I have particular reasons to dislike.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What reasons?—You are certainly the oddest compound that ever made up one man. One minute, all alive and merry; the next, <HI>tcute à la mort</HI>. Now would I lay ten to one that little slut of a sister of mine, that Polly, has done something to vex you. You have be-rhimed her in some woeful madrigal, and she has taken no notice of it: for nothing but love could sink a young fellow of so much pleasantry into such low spirits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, one thing more, and but one per∣haps, could have this effect on me. Suppose now all my uneasiness should arise from friendship, from my friendship for you, Frank.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>From your friendship for me? Impossi∣ble. For, without flattery, there is not a man in the world to whom I should so soon wish to be of service. Be quick, and clear up this mystery, and let me know in plain English the cause of all this disquietude.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You know, Careless, I never objected to any schemes of mirth and jollity, nay, have often proposed them myself. I am a young man as well
<PB N="3" REF="9"/>
as you, love mirth as well as you, and enjoy my pleasures as heartily: but I cannot bear to see the man whom I love best in the world, whose sister I am doatingly fond of, and to whom I have reason to think, I am not indifferent ——I cannot bear I say to see that man betrayed by the goodness of his heart into ruin, and falling a prey to sharpers and pickpockets!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>What can all this mean? Sharpers and pickpockets!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Hard words, I must confess: but for my part, I see no difference between a cheat at the orange barrow, or the hazard-table; nor have I more contempt for a poor rogue in rags than a rascal in embroidery. To be plain with you, Frank, I believe these new friends of ours, these three men, to meet whom was the chief reason that brought us to town, are no better than arrant sharpers; who have a mind for a few throws at your estate, and will take care to secure the odds on their side.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Away with these idle and ungenerous sus∣picions, for shame, Charles. They are three as hearty honest fellows as any in the world. Besides, they are our fellow-countrymen, you know. They are of the nation, honey.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>National reflections are always mean and scandalous: but it is owing to such men as these that so much undeserved scandal has been thrown on our country: a country, which has always pro∣duced men as remarkable for honour and genius as any in the world. A few mean wretches, who are acknowledged rogues and vagabonds there, are no sooner landed here, than they commence fine gentlemen and persons of honour.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="4" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>But still I see no reason to look on these gentlemen in this odious light. Two of them espe∣cially, Shark and Rook, are men of as liberal and gentlemanlike appearance as I ever was acquaint∣ed with; and M'Shuffle, though not quite so gen∣teel and polite, has a blunt honesty about him, which makes it ridiculous as well as unjust to sus∣pect him of any villainy. Besides, Rook's estate lies contiguous to mine, and he is very well ac∣quainted with the whole neighbourhood.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>With every acre of your estate, that I dare say; and knows how deep he may touch you, to a shilling. As to that smooth specious behavi∣our, which takes you in, Frank, it is the common gloss and varnish of many a scoundrel, and lack∣ers over most of the sharpers in town. But in that rough unpolished rascal M'Shuffle, the cheat is too gross to pass. The rank brogue in his mouth, with all that timber in his legs, and brass in his countenance, that have so long distinguished the pretended Irish <HI>Jontleman</HI> from the true gentlemen of Ireland.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Come, come, Charles, no more of this. It is not handsome in you. I would not have them suspect your thoughts of them, on any ac∣count: nor do I chuse myself to hear any abuse of my friends.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Your friends!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I shall always regard them as such till I have full proof the contrary: and prithee now, my dear Knowell, do not disturb the merriment of the company, but be as free, jolly, and sociable, as usual. At the same time I give you my word, that when you can shew any convincing reasons that they are not men of honour, I will have done with them. Will this satisfy you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="5" REF="11"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Entirely: but in the mean time have a care; do not engage too hastily, and suffer convic∣tion to come too late for your relief.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Never fear me. I shall be cautious, I'll warrant you. But we lose time: we are in the land of joy now, Charles; life is short, and hours are precious. Let's in, and enquire after our friends, and see about the girls, my boy: soft, smiling, delicate, tempting rogues, Charles! not like red-armed washerwomen and dirty bed-makers. Per∣haps too we shall meet with some Oxford acquain∣tance, for I know that Bob Lounge, and Dick Scamper drew for their quarterage but two days ago; and they always spend the first week after they receive it in Covent-Garden.</P>

<P>Poor Careless! He is so fond of these fellows, that nothing but his absolute ruin would convince him of their villainy. To prevent which, and, at the same time, to lay them quite open to him, I have pretended to enter into this association, and to act in concert with them: in which, if I were really in earnest, I should even be a greater rascal than themselves. With what joy the scoundrels lifted me in their gang! <Q>“How useful I might be to them! How easily I might draw Careless in! and what a pretty fortune I might secure to ”myself!</Q>—<Q>And then that broad-mouthed scoun∣drel, M'Shuffle, swearing upon his shalvation “there's no shin in it; and since you can get into the best company, I'll shew you two or tree tricks that shall be worth two or tree tousand a-year, ”honey.</Q>—Dogs! But what to do about this intend∣ed marriage?—Careless's reserve, in this instance, vexes me. She's a fine girl, that's the truth on't;
<PB N="7" REF="13"/>
and sometimes seems to be possessed of a mind and disposition above the rest of the sisterhood: poor Frank thinks her an angel, and worth forty thou∣sand pounds into the bargain. What pity it is that an excess of honesty and good-nature should make a man liable to be imposed on; and that the sincerest warmth of friendship should lay him open to the most dangerous enemies!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, ay, don't let us do the thing by halves, but put your scheme in full force this very evening. You may easily get him into play, for when he is tipsy he is fond of it. Win a good round sum of him, and take his bond for it imme∣diately. Rook, you were clerk to an attorney, and know enough of the law to draw it up on the spot. In a day or two, press him home for the money; and then he will be glad to marry Lucy as soon as possible, to extricate himself. He will be obliged to snap at the scheme, without having time to look too deeply into it, and we shall finish the whole bu∣siness before he goes out of town again.</P>

<P>Why really, gentlemen, this is more free and easy than a moping college life, I must confess: and to be let into the secrets of the knowing ones is a genteeler subsistance, and will introduce one into better company than all the learning that can be scraped together at the university.</P>

<P>O ma'am! I can assure you they lives very well. I was an Oxford girl myself. My father was a barber, and mayor of the town once. It was a gentleman-commoner of <HI>Marlin's College</HI> (a sweet, pretty, dear, good-natured man as ever lived) that first <HI>ruined</HI> me; and has been a particular good friend to me ever since. O my dear Jack Airy! when will he be in town? Why did not you bring him up along with you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Why, poor Jack has got into a sad scrape with the <HI>Doctors</HI>, as you call them, about a riot; and so they have confined him to college for a month. It is a pity they did not rusticate him, Charles; for then he might have been in town the whole time. But he'll come up again soon with a pocket full of money, and then Nancy—But here comes the wine.</P>

<P>Ay, my dear, this is the night of action: the business of to-night will shorten the scene of courtship between you most wonderfully. They

<P>But should not you be there too? how will the business go on without you?</P>
</SP>

<SP>

<P>Very true. I had forgot my fortune.

<P>Torture you! What in the name of won∣der can be got into you? I left you scarce an hour ago drinking and hollaing like a mad thing; and now I find you as dull and melancholy as a fresh-man at college after a jobation.</P>

<P>Since you left us I have been fool enough to play, and have lost six thousand pounds to Shark.</P>

<P>Six thousand pounds!—You have made short work of it, Gentlemen, and dispatched a great deal of business in a very little time.—Mr. Shark! a word with you, if you please.—This is a good round sum, I must insist upon four thousand.</P>

<P>O good, Mr. M'Shuffle, don't be out∣rageous. I shall go very calmly to work.—I say, Careless, you shan't pay a shilling of this money.</P>

<P>O, I must; I must, indeed, Charles. Sup∣posing your suspicions to be true, it is impossible to prove them, and I am bound in honour to pay the money. So, Mr. Shark, I'll give you my note immediately.</P>

<P>It is not impossible to prove them—You shall give no note.</P>

<P>Mr. Careless, you have behaved like a man of honour, and a gentleman, and as such I always regarded you. But as for your friend there, I shall find a time—</P>

<P>Find a time, Sir!—There's none like the present time—Nay, take your hand from your sword: I'll encounter you with your own wea∣pons; a little art, Mr. Shark; two or tree little tricks, Mr. M'Shuffle.—You shall give no note, Frank.—I will produce a person that shall lay down

the whole sum for you immediately. Will that satisfy you, Gentlemen?</P>

<P>My Lucy! This is generous beyond ex∣pression.—Do you, Madam, interest yourself in my distress? How can I return you proper thanks?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I deserve no thanks at your hands, Sir! Give them to your friend Mr. Knowell. He is the only person to whom they are due.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>More mysteries! Explain, Charles, for heaven's sake.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>That, Sir, must be my province: and since, in spite of my present situation, I cannot re∣late this dark history of my shame without a con∣scious abhorrence of it, I shall be as brief as pos∣sible. In a word then, Sir, the friendship of these men for you, and your intended marriage with me, was all a laid scheme concerted for your ruin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="27" REF="33"/>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>How! Villains! But by what means? pray go on, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>First, Sir, they were to draw you into play, and by packed cards and loaded dice make you lose a considerable sum to them. This, it seems, they have already effected. Then, Sir, you were to have been decoyed to marry me, (whom you supposed a great fortune) which would have made you liable to a false debt of ten thousand pounds, due from me to Shark upon a bond. Here, Sir, is the bond with the blanks not yet filled up, unsigned, and unsealed.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE><HI>Delivers a bond.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Monstrous rascals! But pray, Madam—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>You shall know all immediately.—Having thus stripped you of so large a part of your fortune, the confederates were to divide the spoils among them; and all these designs upon you would most probably have succeeded, if Mr. Knowell had not dived into the plot, and by an artful pretence of furthering and assisting it, entirely overthrown it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Honest, generous Knowell! How have I deserved such a friend?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>My dear Frank, no more of this.—To be able to serve a person one loves, is surely the highest reward.—But we'll defer stating the measure of obligations and acknowledgments, till we have put a final stroke to this business.—Here, my honest friends there! Messieurs Slap and Co. walk in, gentlemen.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Slap <HI>and other Officers</HI>.</STAGE>
<P>There, those are your prisoners.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Slap.</HI></SPEAKER>

<P>If I once got well out of this shame scrape, upon my shoul I would not pretend to be a jontleman any longer, but would beg my way back, as I came here, faith, with a hay-fork in my hand.<STAGE><HI>Exit with Shark, &amp;c.</HI></STAGE></P>

<P>You must know, Frank, that Lucy is under our protection: I'll let you into the parti∣culars by and by.</P>

<P>Dear Charles, you have saved me from ruin. How infinitely am I obliged to you!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Know.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, no more of that, prithee, now.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Care.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Charles, I will say no more of my obligations to you, since I shall have almost an im∣mediate opportunity of making you a recompence, which I believe you will be fond of. I will acquaint my father of this whole affair as soon as possible, and at the same time let him know of the fondness that has so long subsisted between you and Polly; and, faith, I think your marrying her, Charles, is a more agreeable conclusion of this business, than my being tied to little Lucy here.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER><HI>Lucy.</HI></SPEAKER>
<P>I am conscious, Sir, that I deserve all you can say of me; but I can assure you that I am Heartily sorry for the concern I have had in this bu∣siness, and I hope my future conduct will convince you of my repentance.—In the mean time, Sir, give me leave to say that it would be happy for
<PB N="29" REF="35"/>
every young student of the university, if his jour∣nies to London should turn out as improving lec∣tures as your own: and happy indeed would it be for every gentleman who engages at play, if he had such a friend as your's, to convince him that nothing but folly or knavery can draw people to the hazard-table.</P>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. MATTOCKS. Enters with a Pack of Cards.</HEAD>
<L>HERE they are, Ladies!—Shou'd these charming Packs</L>
<L>Be doubly loaded with a filthy Tax?</L>
<L>My Card to your's, my Lord, a thousand Pound!</L>
<L>Oh, charming Sport! Oh! might I deal 'em round!</L>
<L>Yet I will use 'em; and, oh deign to list!</L>
<L>Tho' 'tis no Lecture on the Game of Whist.</L>
<L>The future doom of Gamesters to explore,</L>
<L>I, like the Sybill's leaves, the Cards turn o'er.</L>
<L>Nor, think, ye Fair, these Books of Fate deceive,</L>
<L>These only Books 'tis modish to believe.</L>
<L>First, with long Staff, short Coat, a swaggering Spark,</L>
<L>Some Gambler 'Prentice, or Attorney's Clerk,</L>
<L>His Fortune asks—what Card describes these Cubs?</L>
<L>Oh! here I have him—in the <HI>Knave of Clubs</HI>.</L>
<L>By clear Construction of these Pips I read,</L>
<L>Thus he will play his Cards, and thus succeed:</L>
<L>At Hazard, Faro, Brag, he joins the Groupe,</L>
<L>And ends a Knave, as he commenc'd a Dupe:</L>
<L>And thence his broken Fortunes to repair,</L>
<L>At Hounslow first, then Tyburn, takes the Air.</L>
<L>Here, in <HI>The King of Diamonds</HI>, pictur'd stands</L>
<L>An Heir, just warm in his d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Father's Lands.</L>
<L><PB REF="37"/>Now Hey for Cards and Dice! his Elbows shake;</L>
<L>The sympathizing Trees and Acres quake.</L>
<L>His Cooks lament, Dogs howl, and Grooms regret</L>
<L>Their Fate depending on each desperate Bet.</L>
<L>Now dup'd, the Bullet whizzes thro' his Head,</L>
<L>And shatters Dust to Dust, by Lead to Lead.</L>
<L>Lo! next to my prophetic Eye, there starts</L>
<L>A beauteous Gamester in <HI>The Queen of Hearts</HI>.</L>
<L>The Cards are dealt, the fatal Pool is lost,</L>
<L>And all her golden Hopes for ever crost.</L>
<L>Yet still this card-d voted Fair I view,</L>
<L>Whate'er her Luck, to <HI>Honour</HI> ever true.</L>
<L>So tender there, if Debts croud fast upon her,</L>
<L>She'd pawn her Virtue to preserve her <HI>Honour</HI>.</L>
<L>Thrice happy were my Art, cou'd I foretell,</L>
<L>Cards wou'd be soon abjur'd by each fond Belle!</L>
<L>Yet I pronounce, who cherish still this Vice,</L>
<L>And the pale Vigils keep of Cards and Dice,</L>
<L>'Twill in their Charms strange havock make, Ye Fair!</L>
<L>Which <HI>Rouge</HI> in vain shall labour to repair.</L>
<L>Beauties shall grow mere Hags, Toasts wither'd Jades,</L>
<L>Frightful, and ugly as <HI>The Queen of Spades</HI>.</L>
