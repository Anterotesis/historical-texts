<L>Love is, in youth, a pleasing fruit,</L>
<L>Does with the season aptly suit;</L>
<L>And where its fertile branches shoot,</L>
<L>With health and joy we're feasted:</L>

<L>'Tis a t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee bearing out of time,</L>

<L>In ancient fable we are told,</L>
<L>A lcides of immortal mould,</L>
<L>Did for a wench a distaff hold,</L>
<L>And gravely sat to spinning.</L>
<L>Think when the fool a master plays,</L>
<L>And weds his maid, although he strays,</L>
<L>He is no worse than Hercules;</L>
<L>And pray, Sirs, spare your grinning.</L>

<L>Folks may find fault with this and that,</L>
<L>Say love with youth comes only pat,</L>
<L>That youthful pairs give tit for tat,</L>
<L>And all goes fine and clever.</L>
<L>That age should prudent be and cold▪</L>
<L>But if men love not e'er they are old,</L>
<L>Thus much to say, I will be bold,</L>
<L>'Tis better late than never.</L>
