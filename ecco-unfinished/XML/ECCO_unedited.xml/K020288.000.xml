<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE character of <HI>Sally</HI> (in which the little actress who performed it discovered more than the dawn of theatrical genius) is an imitation of that of <HI>Babet,</HI> in the comedy of <HI>La Fausse Agnès,</HI> by <HI>Destouches</HI>—and there are some traits of the character of <HI>Kitchen,</HI> in the 3d vol. of <HI>The CONNOISSEUR.</HI></P>
<P>To these acknowledgments, the Author has only to add his most grateful thanks to the Publick, for their candid and indulgent recep∣tion of this little piece, as well as to the per∣formers for their great excellence, in the re∣presentation of it.</P>

<P>Ha, George!—How do you?—Well—but you need not look so melancholy—What! in mourning!—another annuity, I suppose—Ha, George!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—I am in mourning, Sir, for a dear and worthy friend, and a most valuable partner—a man, whose goodness of heart was even superior to his admirable talents in his profession.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your friend's death was a public loss, Sir.—He was deservedly a favourite of the pub∣lick, and is very generally regretted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, but George, now you have put on mourning for your friend, I am afraid you will
<PB N="3" REF="6"/>
be obliged to continue to wear it for Covent∣garden theatre.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope not, Sir—The publick is candid and generous; and we must be attentive and indus∣trious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—you have been dabbling again, I see.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A stroke at the Jubilee—Ha, Mr. Dapperwit!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>An innocent laugh, Sir—raised out of an ad∣venture which, I have taken the liberty to sup∣pose, happened during that period.—As to the Jubilee itself, or the design and conduct of it, I cannot consider them as objects of satire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir? they have been roundly attacked—Lodgings without beds—Dinners without victuals—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know what you mean, Sir.—My friend Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quin has infinite humour, but his pleasantries are exceedingly harmless, and I believe he wishes they should be so.—The scandal of others is mere dirt—throw a great deal, and some of it will stick. But the satire of Pasquin is like fuller's-earth—it daubs your coat indeed for a time—but it soon grows dry; and when it rubs off, your coat is so much the cleaner.—Thus it has happened on the present occasion—for after all, gentlemen, if a building be erected for a particular purpose, is not it natural to pull it down again, when that pur∣pose is answered? A great number of people can∣not
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
be assembled without creating a croud—a rainy day will prevent the exhibition of a pageant—and heavy showers destroy the effect of a firework.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, Sir—but an ode without poetry—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to the ode—it had one capital fault, I must confess.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY and JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—and what was it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Gentlemen, I understood every word of it.—Now, an ode, they say—an ode—to be very good, should be wholly unintelligible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, your servant, Sir!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—but you intend to give it us here, I suppose?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No—the ode can no where be heard to so much advantage as from the mouth of the au∣thor—and indeed it was so happily calculated for the time and place, for which it was originally in∣tended, and the speaker so truly felt a noble enthu∣siasm on the occasion, that you have lost a very ex∣quisite pleasure (never to be retrieved) by not hearing it at Stratford-upon-Avon.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir—but the pageant and the mas∣querace—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Those you shall see, Sir—and perhaps they may appear to more advantage, and be seen
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
with more satisfaction, at the Theatres Royal, than they could have been at Stratford itself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—but George—tell us a little of your comedy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Walk in, Sir, and it will speak for itself—The curtain is just going to draw up.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And how do you feel yourself?—Eh, George!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Much as usual on similar occasions—all hurry and flutter—which strangers are apt to mis∣take for high spirits, and my friends and acquain∣tance know to be nothing but apprehension.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>We'll give you a hand—I know of a strong party against it, I can tell you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>DAPPERWIT.</SPEAKER>
<P>I fear no party, unless my own dulness raises one against me. The publick will suffer no party, no malice, to interrupt its amusements.—If I succeed, I shall owe my success to their indulgence—if I fail, I shall owe it to myself. With these sentiments I enter the theatre.—Come, Gen∣tlemen—my trial is near coming on, for the play must be just going to begin.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>TOWNLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>We attend you, Sir.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>JENKINS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, little Dapperwit—Have a good heart, my boy! We'll keep it up, I warrant you!</P>

<P>Come along with me then, and we'll teach you how to despise sleep.—There is a set of us have taken the room beyond the music for the whole

time of the Jubilee—and it serves us for dining∣room, parlour, and bed-chamber. Ever since dinner to-day—faith I believe I may say yesterday, for it's almost day-light again—we have been fol∣lowing the example set us at the amphitheatre, and have been drinking bumpers to the immortal memory of Shakespeare, to the steward of the Ju∣bilee, with a round of Shakespeare's toasts—Here old Snarl! here's a jubilee-favour! see here! <STAGE>(shewing his cockade.)</STAGE> So come along with me, my boy, and I'll introduce you to the jolliest com∣pany at Stratford upon Avon—for</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FIRST MAN PASSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is flying as they say—flying to town in one day, as they call it.—Hoisted into the coach
<PB N="6" REF="15"/>
at ten o'clock at night, and stuck together as close as dried figs—Here, in spite of fatigue, we fall asleep before midnight, and soon after wake with a damned crash, and find ourselves canted into a slough by way of a feather-bed—Damn their flying, I say—a tight ship with plenty of sea-room is worth forty on't.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>WOMAN PASSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am sure it's a shame, so it is, to stuff the coach in the manner they do—six inside passengers, two children in lap—three upon the box—four upon the top of the coach, and half a dozen in the basket—besides hardware par∣cels and haunches of venison in the boot and the coach seats. Such a load! no wonder the machine should break down or turn over.</P>

<SPEAKER>ANOTHER WOMAN PASSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Mercy on me! I am in such a pickle—I am ashamed to be seen—and then I shall never reco∣ver my fright—pray, ma'am, could you get me a little hartshorn and water?</P>

<P>Get me some mulled wine and a dry toast—D'ye hear, you Sir? zouns, how this house is al∣tered! It used to be one of the best inns upon the road—but now there's hardly getting any body to come near one—no attendance—no accom∣modation!</P>

<SPEAKER>LANDLADY.</SPEAKER>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>SECOND MAN PASSENGER.</SPEAKER>
<P>Jubalo! I have heard of nothing but jubilees, and Shakespeares, and mulberry-trees, for these three months. What the devil is this jubilee?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Lack-a-day, Sir, I can hardly tell you myself; but it is one of the finest things that ever was seen—There is the great little gentleman from London, and I don't know how many painters, and carpenters, and musicianers, and actor-people, come down on purpose—Great doings, I promise you.</P>

<SPEAKER>LANDLADY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh yes—abundance of dancing—but begun with going to church, and singing of <HI>antums</HI> and <HI>o-ra-to-ries,</HI> I think they call them—and then there is eating and drinking, and pro∣cessioning, and masquerading, and horse-racing, and fireworks—So gay—and as merry as the day is long.</P>

<P>La Fleur! Take the baggage off the chaise, and come to me immediately.—My dear Frankly! who would have thought of finding you here? What brought you to Stratford upon Avon?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Birmingham stage-coach.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, ridiculous! And what could cram you in∣to a stage-coach?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>An accident—and another accident had like to have thrown me out of it again.—I have been on a recruiting party in Staffordshire.—Losing a wheel of my post-chaise, about six miles off, I was glad to get into the stage, which I had scarce well done, when it was overturned. My fellow-travellers are but just set forward for Lon∣don.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="11" REF="20"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—I met the plebeians just as I drove into the yard.—I have been on the road all night myself, egad. I rattled through Oxford at mid∣night, loud enough to rouse all the sleepy fellows of colleges—and am just arrived here, where, I find, no body can get a bed to sleep in.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what hurried you so?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, you must know I should have been here last night, at farthest—but having promised to dine at the Macaroni yesterday with Rochester, Brampton, and Evergreen—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>The noblemen of those titles, d'ye mean?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, to be sure—but you never mention ti∣tles—titles of people you live with. 'Tis not the <HI>Ton—</HI>When you say plain <HI>Townly, Lovelace, Ogleby,</HI> and so forth,—People who live in the world mean the Duke, Marquis, or Lord of the name;—but when we say Jack Wilson, George Belford, Ned Thompson—and so on—we mean a commoner—We speak of peers as peers subscribe themselves in writing—no Christian name—and no∣thing of the title except the place from which it is taken.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>I beg your pardon—proceed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="12" REF="21"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then being engaged to dine with them, I say, I did not set out from Pall-Mall till be∣tween eight or nine o'clock.—I lost six hundred before the chaise came to the door.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Deep play!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Pooh! nothing at all—Lovelace lost four and thirty hundred to Jack Airy of the Guards, at the same sitting.—We used to set ten or twenty, perhaps, sometime ago—but now, they never make up a <HI>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uleau</HI> of less than fifty guineas.—La Fleur! <STAGE>(calling)</STAGE> where is this fellow? I must get off my boots.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did you ride any part of the way?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>What in the dark, and on the road?—Oh, no!—Indeed I hardly ever ride now but in the spring, through the three parks; or to pay visits.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Visits on horseback?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why not? We all visit on horseback since the new pavement—and I'm very often out the whole morning without going off the stones.—Take horse at Hall's stables, a short bait at Ar∣thur's—a slice of pine-apple, and half a dozen of scandal and politicks at Betty's—and so make the tour of the parish of St. James's through the square, Pall-Mall, Piccadilly—and Hall's stables again.—But, La Fleur! Where the duce is this
<PB N="13" REF="22"/>
fellow! I shan't have my hair drest these three hours.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not these six hours, if one may judge by the quantity.—Is not so much hair behind troublesome?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not at all—So far from it, that above half of it is false—for in an undress, unless you have a club as thick as both your doubled-fists, you are not fit to be seen—but with that, a little French hat cut to the quick, that leaves your face as broad as Harry the Eighth's, an ell of shirt∣sleeves hanging over a short half-inch pair of ruffles, a coat powdered half way down your back, a tambour waistcoat, white linen-breeches, and a taper switch in your hand, your figure, Frankly, must be irresistible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Your</HI> figure you mean, Marcourt.—But what could prevail on you to exhibit it at Strat∣ford? Do you intend to make one in the pageant, and shew yourself as one of the characters of Shakespeare?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>No faith; such an original did not exist in his days; and the writers of our time have left off drawing other people's characters for the sake of exposing their own.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—but your business here, Marcourt?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Business of consequence, I can tell you, Frank∣ly.—One must have a wife, you know, if it is only for the pleasure of getting rid of her.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="14" REF="23"/>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, I conceive you! A matrimonial affair.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—the old affair with Charlotte.—We have now brought matters to a crisis.—Old Cross and his wife—the father and mother, you know—are always quarreling;—no wonder, therefore, they squabble about the choice of a husband for their daughter.—The mother, who is a kind of a cousin of mine, and is desirous of bringing the girl into the world, has pitched upon me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>A wise lady!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—but the tramontane father—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Has chosen some other man, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>He has—but who now, of all mankind, d'ye think is, in his idea, a proper husband for his daughter? That horrid fellow Kitchen.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Kitchen! What, the famous <HI>bon vivant?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>The same—a fellow that has not an idea beyond a haunch of venison—Kitchen and old Cross are of a club; and when Mrs. Cross and he have been wrangling, Kitchen, who is reckon∣ed a joker at the club, puts him into humour again.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="15" REF="24"/>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But he has some real pleasantry, they say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not he—dull, dull as colonel Grin, who has got Joe Miller by heart, and is always teazing you with a story.—No <HI>splash</HI> in the world—His conversation is all table talk,—made up of eating and drinking.—He is a mere walking larder—His mind is a great pantry, from which he is always serving up some choice dishes for the entertainment of his friends and acquaintance.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>But has not he been able to render himself a formidable rival?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Formidable! ridiculous—no, no—the father is his friend indeed,—but the mother knows reason—and then the girl is so fond—poor thing! she doats on me to distraction—pre∣tends to join in old Cross's designs in favour of Kitchen, but holds a privy council with the mo∣ther and me, and turns every motion to my ad∣vantage.—Now this it is, Frankly, that brings me post to Stratford.—The father you must know—but mum! here comes Kitchen himself—I knew we should meet—but I am prepared for him.—I shall snap the delicious morsel out of his mouth, I promise him.</P>

<P>Your servant, Sir.</P>
<STAGE><HI>[Distant civility on both sides—con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itedly on the part of</HI> Marcourt, <HI>and rough on that of</HI> Kitchen.]</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD.</SPEAKER>
<P>The jubilee, Sir, is on account of our fa∣mous townsman, Shakespeare—the great play-writer, that wrote King Lear and his three Daughters, and Othello Moor of Venice. They say he loved venison—and, Heaven bless him! he has set many a haunch going in our house—the town is brim full of company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="17" REF="26"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>If it is a Jubilee, it must be nonsensical.—I was at the Jubilee at Rome some years ago.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>LANDLORD,</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh, this is quite another thing, I believe, Sir. There is no pope<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in our Jubilee, though it be∣gan with going to church, they say.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never knew any of our travelled fine gen∣tlemen that did not draw comparisons between things totally opposite. Between antient Rome and this country, there might be some resemblance; but modern Italy is no more to be compared to Old England, than a sirloin of beef to a spoonful of macaroni.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>How should a man talk of things abroad, who has past his whole life at home? You will allow us, Mr. Kitchen, to be more competent judges, who have travelled, and skimmed the cream of Europe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can travel to more advantage than most of you, without stirring out of my elbow chair.—I can digest what I read, and chew the cud of re∣flection upon it.—As for you fine gentlemen, you skim the cream of Europe, as you say, and bring home nothing but froth, and whipt-sillabub.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well said, John Bull!—You like Shakespeare now, I warrant you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Like him? I adore him! No man of sense and true taste can do otherwise.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="18" REF="27"/>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, I thought so. You prefer his puns and quibbles to the wit and humour of Moliere, I suppose.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, Sir.—Bigotry is not the growth of this country, in literature any more than religion. Puns and quibbles were the vicious taste of the times; and if they made their way into the pulpit, no wonder that they were to be met with on the stage. I hate a forced chace of puns and little conceits, as much as you can do.—Sheer wit is like sheer wine—but a pun or a quibble—rot it—a pun is nothing but jingling the glasses.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! they are not the only faults of h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s bar∣barous farces—as uncouth a medley to present to this age as a pageant or a puppet-shew.—No foreigner can endure him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>They can't taste him, because they don't under∣stand him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>MARCOURT.</SPEAKER>
<P>They can understand him well enough to be shocked at his absurdities. A baby in the first act become a grown person in the last—plays made out of halfpenny ballads—ghosts and grave∣diggers, witches and hobgoblins.—Brutus and Cassius conversing like a couple of English Com∣mon-councilmen.—Hamlet killing a rat—and Othello raving about an old pocket-handker∣chief.—There's your Shakespeare for you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I should have been sure you had tra∣velled, if I had not known it before.—This is a
<PB N="19" REF="28"/>
mere hash of foreign criticism, as false as superfi∣cial, and made up of envy and ignorance.—Shake∣speare, Mr. Marcourt—Shakespeare is the Turtle of Literature. The lean of him may perhaps be worse than the lean of any other meat;—but there is a deal of green fat, which is the most delicious stuff in the world.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>FRANKLY.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, Marcourt, I think the gentleman is too hard for you.</P>

<SP>

<P>Ay; you have your particular place for every thing—Not because it's better, but because it's the fashion—You would sooner give a crown a yard more for a silk than buy it any where but on Ludgate-Hill—But I am never in the right in any thing—I dare say now you will insist upon it, that this room is not damp—tho' I can swear it was not dry when I came down this morning—I shall catch my death of cold I suppose.</P>

<P>Lord! you're so delicate—You may think yourself very well off to have a good house over your head, when so many people are glad to lie in a hay<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oft, and to lodge their servants in lan∣daus and post-chaises.</P>

<P>Well—it's no matter—I deserve it—what the plague had I to do at Stratford?—Such a ridi∣culous journey! I wonder how I could be such a blockhead as to give into it—And as for yourself too, you care no more for Shakespeare, than I for the Pope of Rome.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mrs. CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what does that signify, as to going to the jubilee? Are not all the people of condition round the country to be here? Shakespeare is

nothing to the purpose; I would not see the finest play the man ever wrote but in a side-box—And one only goes into the side-box, because it's going into the best company.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, that's reason enough for you to do any thing—Because a Countess, who has a range of rooms as long as Pall-Mall, gets the whole town together at her route—You must have a route too, and squeeze all your acquaintance into two closets and a cupboard—Nay, last winter, when the town ran masquerade-mad, you got a ridiculous party of about eighteen or twenty fops and fli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts, to make fools of themselves, and called it a masquerade.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir, I have obeyed your orders, you see.—I have crossed the country from the West of England, on purpose to attend you.—Colonel Cramwell, Lord Pepper, and two or three more of us, have been on a coasting party.—It has been a delightful summer; and I think I never knew the whitings, turbots, brills, red mullets, and John Dories in higher perfection.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am most heartily glad to see you, Mr. Kit∣chen; and this meeting will, I think, be deci∣sive.—Our schemes are now ripe for execution—I have humoured my wife in this ridiculous journey, merely because it gave me a better opportunity of
<PB N="29" REF="38"/>
thwarting her in the grand point of Charlotte's marriage.—This house, you must know, has been taken in our name for this month, under the pre∣tence of attending this jubilee—but <HI>really</HI> in order to make the family parishioners—by which means the banns have been asked, as the law requires, between you and Charlotte—and the minister is prepared to perform the ceremony this very morn∣ing.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But is Miss Charlotte prepared for it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Perfectly—Charlotte is a shrewd clever girl; and tho' she carries it fair with her mother, will do every thing that I bid her, and is wholly in your interest.—Oh, here she is!</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Charlotte.</STAGE>
<P>Come hither, Charlotte! I have once more the pleasure of presenting Mr. Kitchen to you, and by and by I hope you will receive him as my son-in-law.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Don't you think, Sir, I have a hard task of it between you and my mama? Your commands are as opposite as north and south, and yet you both expect to be obeyed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Never tell me—I am master of the family—it is her duty to honour and obey; and I am resolved to be absolute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ah, my dear papa—Your insisting so eter∣nally upon your right, is the very thing that
<PB N="30" REF="39"/>
renders it so difficult to maintain it. All women love power; and the best way of securing their obedience, is to tell them that they govern you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Did not I say, she was a shrewd girl, Mr. Kit∣chen?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>The young lady is perfectly in the right. A wife is like a trout; she must be tickled, Mr. Cross.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well—but have you prepared matters? How do you propose to manage it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Just as I have managed every thing else: while my mama supposes I approve of <HI>her</HI> choice, she has no suspicion of my favouring your own—but what d'ye think she would say, if I was to tell her that Mr. Marcourt was my aversion?—I have never dropt a single word to her in behalf of Mr. Kitchen.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well—that may be right enough per∣haps.—But no wonder that Marcourt's your aversion. He is one of the most empty feather∣headed coxcombs in town.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>An insipid fellow, Madam!—neither pepper nor salt in him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CROSS.</SPEAKER>
<P>True. My daughter has not the least relish for him.—But Charlotte! won't it be diffi∣cult to carry on this affair in the midst of so much company?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh no! the more, the merrier, Sir.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the fewer, the better cheer, Madam.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in this instance, Sir. This jubilee is a fortunate circumstance. One is never so private as in a croud, you know.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>KITCHEN.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true. Intrigues carried on in the face of the world are always least liable to detec∣tion—and now-a-days most people seem to act upon that principle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CHARLOTTE.</SPEAKER>
<P>A truce with your satire, Sir; for we are not to act barefaced, I assure you: and the jubilee con∣cluding with a masquerade affords us an admirable opportunity—Do you—Lord, I'm a mad girl—I was going to make an assignation with you before my father's face.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Do! do—I insist on it.</P>
</SP>
