<HEAD>EPISTLE, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE you, dear TOWNSHEND, o'er the billows ride,</L>
<L>MULGRAVE in front, and HANGER by thy side,</L>
<L>Met it delights the woods and wilds to court,</L>
<L>For rustic feats and unambitious sport.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At that dim hour when fading lamps expire,</L>
<MILESTONE N="5"/>
<L>When the last, ling'ring, clubs to bed retire,</L>
<PB N="6" REF="4"/>
<L>I rise!—how should I then thy feelings shock,</L>
<L>Unshav'd, unpowder'd, in my shooting frock!</L>
<L>What frock? thou criest—I'll tell thee—the old brown;</L>
<L>Trimm'd to a jacket, with the skirts cut down—</L>
<MILESTONE N="10"/>
<L>Thou laugh'st; I know, thou do'st; but check that sneer;</L>
<L>What tho' no fashion'd sportsman I appear,</L>
<L>Yet hence thy CHARLES'S voice gains shriller force;</L>
<L>Ah! JACK, if DUNNING shot, he'd not be hoarse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor deem ev'n here the cares of state forgot,</L>
<MILESTONE N="15"/>
<L>I wad with gazettes ev'ry second shot:</L>
<L>ALMON'S bold sheets the intervals supply;</L>
<L>And still, methinks, his charges farthest fly.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oft too, while all around my pointers stray,</L>
<L>With patriot names I cheer them on their way:</L>
<MILESTONE N="20"/>
<L>No servile ministerial runners they!</L>
<PB N="7" REF="5"/>
<L>Not RANGER then, but WASHINGTON, I cry;</L>
<L>Hey on! PAUL JONES, re-echoes to the sky:</L>
<L>Toho! old FRANKLIN—SILAS DEANE, take heed!—</L>
<L>Cheer'd with the sound, o'er hills and dales they speed:</L>
<MILESTONE N="25"/>
<L>Till one, to whose quick sense and practis'd skill</L>
<L>His active followers yield a hasty will,</L>
<L>Touch'd by the scent the passing gales convey,</L>
<L>With startled vigilance presumes the prey:</L>
<L>The rest a disciplin'd subservience keep;</L>
<MILESTONE N="30"/>
<L>Dash where he runs, and as he crouches, creep:</L>
<L>At length the hostile league one point avow:</L>
<L>Now places, places! order, order, now!</L>
<L>"BUNB'RY! let me (I cry) for party's sake,</L>
<L>"Teach thee where best to aim, what ground to take."</L>
<MILESTONE N="35"/>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And see, a young bird rises, weak and slow;</L>
<L>"At him, Sir CHARLES!"—He fires, and lays him low—</L>
<PB N="8" REF="6"/>
<L>Scar'd at the sound, up the full covey springs;</L>
<L>RICHARD at random fires, and only <HI>wings:</HI></L>
<L>Not so thy CHARLES; intent with half-clos'd sight,</L>
<MILESTONE N="40"/>
<L>Cautious I watch their veteran leader's flight:</L>
<L>At him I aim, the covey's head and guide;</L>
<L>I fire; but ah! too plainly on one side:</L>
<L>Again I try, like <HI>rising to explain,</HI></L>
<L>A double barrel's force, but try in vain;</L>
<MILESTONE N="45"/>
<L>Against myself the heated tube recoils,</L>
<L>Nor gains one feather to requite my toils.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But if too soon the startled covey rise,</L>
<L>And move a <HI>previous question</HI> in the skies,</L>
<L>My faithful groom quick marks them as they spring,</L>
<MILESTONE N="50"/>
<L>And counts their noses, undeceiv'd as BYNG:</L>
<L>Whether in close array, and nemine con,</L>
<L>To their old beaten ground the covey's gone;</L>
<PB N="9" REF="7"/>
<L>Or, scattering wild, in petty parties fall,</L>
<L>Some to <HI>pair off,</HI> and some to wait a <HI>call.</HI></L>
<MILESTONE N="55"/>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus from each kindred image, fancy draws</L>
<L>The latent emblem of a nobler cause.</L>
<L>If chance, a stray, lone, bird my course invites,</L>
<L>I think of MEREDITH, and proselytes;</L>
<L>Mean, mangled, game not for itself I prize;</L>
<MILESTONE N="60"/>
<L>Vengeance and PALLISER to memory rise.—</L>
<L>Some senatorial type ev'n Pointers yield;</L>
<L>One loves too narrow, one to wide a field;</L>
<L>This creeps below, that springs above his work,</L>
<L>As HARTLEY slow, or uncontroll'd as BURKE.</L>
<MILESTONE N="65"/>
<L>With rav'nous ardour some devour the prey;</L>
<L>O gentle SAWBRIDGE, lash such fiends away!</L>
<L>Others, with puzzling zeal, small objects mark;</L>
<L>Judicious LUTTRELL, bid them <HI>ware a lark!</HI>—</L>
</LG>
<PB N="10" REF="8"/>
<LG>
<L>But come, dear JACK, all martial as thou art,</L>
<MILESTONE N="70"/>
<L>With spruce cockade, heroically smart,</L>
<L>Come, and once more together let us greet</L>
<L>The long lost pleasures of ST. JAMES'S STREET.</L>
<L>Enough o'er stubbles have I deign'd to tread;</L>
<L>Too long wer't thou at anchor, at SPITHEAD!</L>
<MILESTONE N="75"/>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Come, happy friend! to hail thy wish'd return,</L>
<L>Nor vulgar fire, nor venal light shall burn,</L>
<L>From gentle bosoms purer flames shall rise,</L>
<L>And keener ardours flash from Beauty's eyes.</L>
<L>Methinks, I see thee now resume thy stand,</L>
<MILESTONE N="80"/>
<L>Pride of Fop-alley, tho' a little tann'd:</L>
<L>What tender joy the gazing Nymphs disclosed!</L>
<L>How pine with envy the neglected Beaux!</L>
<L>While many a feeble frown and struggling smile</L>
<L>Fondly reprove thy too adventurous toil,</L>
<MILESTONE N="85"/>
<PB N="11" REF="9"/>
<L>And seem with reprehensive love to say,</L>
<L>"Dear Mr. TOWNSHEND, wherefore didst thou stray!</L>
<L>"What fatal havoc might one shot have made,</L>
<L>"If not thy life, thy leg the forfeit paid!</L>
<L>"That shot thy foretop might have made it's prey,</L>
<MILESTONE N="90"/>
<L>"Or sing'd one dear devoted curl away;</L>
<L>"Or lopp'd that hand, the pride of love and lace;</L>
<L>"Or scarr'd, with bolder sacrilege, thy face."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Soon as to BROOKS'S thence thy footsteps bend,</L>
<L>What gratulations thy approach attend!</L>
<MILESTONE N="95"/>
<L>See GIBBON rap his box; auspicious sign;</L>
<L>That classic compliment and wit combine;</L>
<L>See BEAUCLERK'S cheek a tinge of red surprise,</L>
<L>And Friendship give what cruel Health denies.</L>
<L>Important TOWNSHEND! what can thee withstand?</L>
<MILESTONE N="100"/>
<L>The ling'ring black-ball lags in BOOTHBY'S hand;</L>
<PB N="12" REF="10" MS="y"/>
<L>Ev'n DRAPIER checks the sentimental sigh,</L>
<L>And SMITH, without an oath, suspends the dye.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>That night, to festive wit and friendship due,</L>
<L>That night thy CHARLES'S board shall welcome you.</L>
<MILESTONE N="105"/>
<L>Sallads, that shame ragouts, shall woo thy taste;</L>
<L>Deep shalt thou delve in WELTJE'S motley paste;</L>
<L>D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>RBY shall lend, if not his plate, his Cooks,</L>
<L>And, know, I've bought the best Champaigne from BROOKS;</L>
<L>From liberal BROOKS, whose speculative skill,</L>
<MILESTONE N="110"/>
<L>Is hasty credit, and a distant bill;</L>
<L>Who, nurs'd in clubs, disdains a vulgar trade,</L>
<L>Exults to trust, and blushes to be paid!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On that auspicious night, supremely grac'd</L>
<L>With chosen Guests, the pride of liberal Taste,</L>
<MILESTONE N="115"/>
<PB N="13" REF="11"/>
<L>Not in contentious heat, nor mad'ning strife,</L>
<L>Not with the busy ills, nor cares of life,</L>
<L>We'll waste the fleeting hours; far happier themes</L>
<L>Shall claim each thought, and chase Ambition's dreams.</L>
<L>Each <HI>Beauty</HI> that <HI>Sublimity</HI> can boast</L>
<MILESTONE N="120"/>
<L><HI>He</HI> best shall tell, who still unites them most.</L>
<L>Of wit, of taste, of fancy, we'll debate;</L>
<L>If SHERIDAN for once is not too late:</L>
<L>But scarce a thought to ministers we'll spare,</L>
<L>Unless on Polish Politics, with HARE:</L>
<MILESTONE N="125"/>
<L>Good natur'd DEVON! oft shall then appear</L>
<L>The cool complacence of thy friendly sneer:</L>
<L>Oft shall FITZPATRICK'S wit, and STANHOPE'S ease,</L>
<L>And BURGOYNE'S manly sense unite to please.</L>
<L>And while each guest attends our varied feats</L>
<MILESTONE N="130"/>
<L>Of scatter'd covies and retreating Fleets,</L>
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
<L>Me shall they wish some better sport to gain,</L>
<L>And Thee more glory, from the next campaign.</L>
