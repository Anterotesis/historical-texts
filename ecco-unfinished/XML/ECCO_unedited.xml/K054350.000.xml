<P>HOW fortune drops into the mouth of the di∣ligent man, —see, if I be not transform'd courtier again—four silken gamesters, who attended the king, and were revelling by themselves, at some distance from the shepherds, have drank so plenti∣fully, that their weak brains are turn'd topsy-tur∣vy—I found one of 'em, an old court comrade of mine, retir'd from the rest, sobering himself with sleep under the shade of a hawthorn; I made use of our antient familiarity to exchange garments with him; the pedlar's clothes are on his back, and the pack by his side, as empty as his pockets, for I have sold all my trumpery; not a counter∣feit stone, nor a ribband, glass, pomander, browch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn; they throng'd who shou'd buy first. I pick'd out and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's son, and scar'd my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army—aside, aside, here is more matter for a hot brain.</P>

<P>I know it all, my friend; the king of Sicily is arriv'd.</P>

<P>Not only the king of Sicily is arriv'd, but his daughter; his long-lost daughter, is found!</P>

<SPEAKER>PAULINA.</SPEAKER>
<P>His daughter found! Can it be? how was she sav'd? and where has she been concealed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CAMILLO.</SPEAKER>
<P>That shepherdess, our prince has so long and so secretly affected, proves Sicilia's heiress: the old shepherd, her suppos'd father, deliver'd the man∣ner how he found her upon the coast, produc'd a fardel, in which are uncontested proofs of every circumstance.</P>

<SPEAKER>AUTOLICUS.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, wou'd preferment fall upon my head. I brought the old man and his son to the king's, and told them, I heard them talk of a fardel, and I know not what—but 'tis all one to me; for had I been the finder out of this secret, it wou'd not have relish'd among my other discredits—here come those I have done good to against my will, and already appearing in the blossoms of their for∣tune.</P>

<P>You are well met, sir; you denied that I was a gentleman born; see these clothes! say you see them not, and think me still no gentleman born— give me the iie, do—and try whether I am now no gentleman born.</P>

<P>And so have I, boy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>CLOWN.</SPEAKER>
<P>So you have; but I was a gentleman born be∣fore my father; for the king's son took me by the hand and call'd me brother; and then, the prince, my brother, and the princess, my sister, (that is, that was my sister) called my father, fa∣ther; and so we all wept: and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</P>
