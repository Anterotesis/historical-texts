OF
Peregrine Pickle.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="79" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine arrives at the garison, where he re∣ceives
the last admonitions of Commodore Trun∣nion,
who next day resigns his breath, and is
buried according to his own directions. Some
gentlemen in the country make a fruitless attempt
to accommodate matters betwixt Mr. Gamaliel
Pickle and his eldest son.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT four o'clock in the morning our
hero arrived at the garison, where he
found his generous uncle in extremity,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>apported in bed, by Julia on one side, and lieu∣tenant
Hatchway on the other; while Mr. Jolter
administered spiritual consolation to his soul, and
<PB N="2" REF="7"/>
between whiles comforted Mrs. Trunnion, who,
with her maid, sat by the fire, weeping with
great decorum; the physician having just taken
his last see, and retired, after pronouncing the
fatal prognostic, in which he anxiously wished
he might not be mistaken.</P>
<P>Though the commodore's speech was inter∣rupted
by a violent hiccup, he still retained the
use of his senses; and when Peregrine approach∣ed,
stretched out his hand with manifest signs of
satisfaction. The young gentleman, whose heart
overflowed with gratitude and affection, could
not behold such a spectacle, unmoved. He en∣deavoured
to conceal his tenderness, which in
the wildness of his youth, and in the pride of
his disposition, he considered as a derogation from
his manhood; but, in spite of all his endeavours,
the tears gushed from his eyes, while he kissed
the old man's hand; and he was so utterly dis∣concerted
by his grief, that when he attempted
to speak, his tongue denied its office: so that
the commodore, perceiving his disorder, made a
last effort of strength, and consoled him in these
words: “Swab the spray from your bowsprit,
my good lad, and coil up your spirits. You must
not let the top-lists of your heart give way, be∣cause
you see me ready to go down at these years;
many a better man has foundered before he has
made half my way; thos I trust, by the mercy
of God, I shall be sure in port in a very few
glasses, and fast moored in a most blessed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ding:
for my good friend Jolter hath overhaul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the journal of my sins; and by the observatio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
he hath taken of the state of my soul, I hope <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
shall happily conclude my voyage, and be brough
up in the latitude of heaven. Here has been a
<PB N="3" REF="8"/>
doctor that wanted to stow me chock-full of phy∣sic;
but, when a man's hour is come, what sig∣nifies
his taking his departure with a 'pothecary's
shop in his hold? Those fellows come along
side of dying men, like the messengers of the ad∣miralty
with sailing orders: but, I told him as
how I could slip my cable without his direction
or assistance, and so he hauled off in dudgeon.
Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s cursed hiccup (damnation seize it) makes
such a rippling in the current of my speech, that
mayhap you don't understand what I say. Now,
while the sucker of my wind pump will go, I
would willingly mention a few things, which I
hope you will set down in the log-book of your
remembrance, when I am stiff, d'ye see. There's
your aunt sitting whimpering by the fire, I desire
you will keep her tight, warm, and easy in her
old age; she's an honest heart in her own way,
and thos she goes a little crank and humoursom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
by being often over-stowed with Nantz and re∣ligion,
she has been a faithful ship-mate to me,
and I dare say never turned in with another man,
since we first embarked in the same bottom.
Jack Hatchway, you know the trim of her as
well as e'er a man in England, and I believe she
has a kindness for you; whereby, if you two
will grapple in the way of matrimony, when I
am gone, I do suppose, that my godson, for love
of me, will allow you to live in the garison all
the days of your life.”</P>
<P>Peregrine assured him, he would with plea∣sure
comply with any request he should make, in
behalf of two persons whom he esteemed so
much; and the lieutenant, with a waggish sneer,
which even the gravity of the situation could not
prevent, thanked them both for their good will,
<PB N="4" REF="9"/>
telling the commodore, he was obliged to him
for his friendship, in seeking to promote him to
the command of a vessel which he himself had
wore out in the service: that notwithstanding,
he should be content to take charge of her, tho'
he could not help being shy of coming after such
an able navigator.</P>
<P>Trunnion, exhausted as he was, smiled at this
sally, and a ter some pause, resumed his admo∣nitions
in this manner: “I need not talk of
Pipes, because I know you will do for him, without
my recommendation; the fellow has failed with
me in many a hard gale, and I'll warrant him as
stout a seaman as ever set face to the weather:
but I hope you will take care of the rest of my
crew, and not disrate them after I am dead, in
favour of new followers. As for that young wo∣man,
Ned Gauntlet's daughter, I am informed
as how she is an excellent wench, and has a re∣spect
for you; whereby, if you run her on board
in an unlawful way, I leave my curse upon you,
and trust you will never prosper in the voyage of
life: but, I believe you are more of an honest
man, than to behave so much like a pitate. I
beg of all love, you wool take care of your con∣stitution,
and beware of running soul of harlots,
who are no better than so many mermaids, that
sit upon rocks in the sea, and hang out a fair
face for the destruction of passengers; thos I must
say, for my own part, I never met with any of
those sweet singers, and yet I have gone to sea
for the space of thirty years. But, howsomever,
steer your course clear of all such brimstone
bitches; shun going to law as you would shun
the devil, and look upon all attornies as devour∣ing
sharks, or ravenous fish of prey. As soon
<PB N="5" REF="10"/>
as the breath is out of my body, let minute guns
be fired, till I am safe under ground: I would
also be buried in the red jacket I had on, when
I boarded and took the <HI>Renummy.</HI> Let my pi∣stols,
cutlass, and pocket-compass be laid in the
coffin along with me. Let me be carried to the
grave by my own men, dressed in the black caps
and white shirts which my barge's crew were
wont to wear; and they must keep a good look∣out,
that none of your pilfering rapscallions may
come and heave me up again, for the lucre of
what they can get, until my carcase is belayed by
a tomb-stone. As for the motto, or what you
call it, I leave that to you and Mr. Jolter, who
are scholars; but I do desire, that it may not be
ingraved in the Greek or Latin lingos, and much
less in the French, which I abominate, but in
plain English, that when the angel comes to pipe
<HI>all hands</HI> at the great day, he may know that I
am a British man, and speak to me in my mother
tongue. And now I have no more to say, but
God in heav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n have mercy upon my soul, and
send you all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weather, wheresoever you are
bound.” So saying, he regarded every indivi∣dual
around him with a lock of complacency,
and closing his eye, composed himself to rest,
while the whole audience (Pipes himself not ex∣cepted)
were melted with sorrow; and Mrs.
Trunnion consented to quit the room, that she
might not be exposed to the unspeakable anguish
of seeing him expire.</P>
<P>His last moments, however, were not so near
as they imagined; he began to dose, and enjoyed
small intervals of ease, till next day in the after∣noon;
during which remissions, he was heard
to pour forth many pious ejaculations, expressing
<PB N="6" REF="11"/>
his hope, that, for all the heavy cargo of his sins,
he should be able to surmount the foothook∣shrouds
of despair, and get alost to the cross-trees
of God's good favour. At last, his voice sunk
so low, as not to be distinguished; and having
lain about an hour, almost without any percep∣tible
signs of life, he gave up the ghost, with a
groan which anounced his decease.</P>
<P>Julia was no sooner certified of this melan∣choly
event, than she ran to her aunt's chamber,
weeping aloud; and immediately a very decent
concert was performed by the good widow and
her attendants. Peregrine and Hatchway re∣tired
till the corpse should be laid out; and Pipes
having surveyed the body, with a face of rueful
attention, “Well fare thy soul! old Hawser
Trunnion, (said he) man and boy I have known
thee these five and thirty years, and sure a truer
heart never broke biscuit. Many a hard gale
hast thou weathered; but now thy spells are all
over, and thy hull fairly laid up. A better com∣mander
I'd never desire to serve; and who knows
but I may help to set up thy standing rigging in an∣other
world?”</P>
<P>All the servants of the house were affected with
the loss of their old master, and the poor people
in the neighbourhood assembled at the gate, and
by repeated howlings expressed their sorrow for
the death of their charitable benefactor. Pere∣grine,
though he felt every thing which love and
gratitude could inspire on this occasion, was not
so much overwhelmed with affliction, as to be
incapable of taking the management of the fa∣mily
into his own hands. He gave directions
about the funeral with great discretion, after
having paid the compliments of condolance to
<PB N="7" REF="12"/>
his aunt, whom he consoled with the assurance
of his inviolable esteem and affection. He or∣dered
suits of mourning to be made for every
person in the garison, and invited all the neigh∣bouring
gentlemen to the burial, not even ex∣cepting
his father and brother Gam, who did not,
however, honour the ceremony with their pre∣sence;
nor was his mother humane enough to
visit her sister-in-law in her distress.</P>
<P>In the method of interment, the commodore's
injunctions were obeyed to a tittle; and at the
same time our hero made a donation of fifty
pounds to the poor of the parish, as a benefac∣tion
which his uncle had forgot to bequeath.</P>
<P>Having performed these obsequies with the most
pious punctuality, he examined the will, to
which there was no addition since it had been first
executed, adjusted the payment of all the legacies,
and being sole executor, took an account of the
estate to which he had succeeded, and which,
after all deductions, amounted to thirty thousand
pounds. The possession of such a fortune, of
which he was absolute master, did not at all con∣tribute
to the humiliation of his spirit, but in∣spired
him with new ideas of grandeur and mag∣nificence,
and elevated his hope to the highest
pinnacle of expectation.</P>
<P>His domestic affairs being settled, he was vi∣sited
by almost all the gentlemen of the county,
who came to pay their compliments of congra∣tulation,
on his accession to the estate; and some
of them offered their good offices towards a re∣conciliation
betwixt his father and him, induced
by the general detestation which was entertained
for his brother Gam, who was by this time
looked upon by his neighbours as a prodigy of
<PB N="8" REF="13"/>
insolence and malice. Our young squire thanked
them for their kind proposal, which he accepted;
and old Gamaliel, at their intreaties, seemed
very well disposed to an accommodation: but,
as he would not venture to declare himself, before
he had consulted his wife, that favourable dispo∣sition
was rendered altogether ineffectual, by the
instigations of that implacable woman; and our
hero resigned all expectation of being reunited
to his father's house. His brother, as usual, took
all opportunities of injuring his character, by
false aspersions and stories misrepresented, in or∣der
to prejudice his reputation: nor was his sister
Julia suffered to enjoy her good fortune in peace.
Had he undergone such persecution from an alien
to his blood, the world would have heard of his
revenge; but, notwithstanding his indignation,
he was too much tinctured by the prejudices of
consanguinity, to lift his arm in judgment against
the son of his own parents; and this considera∣tion
abridged the term of his residence at the ga∣rison,
where he had proposed to stay for some
months.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="80" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. LXXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The young gentleman having settled his domestic af∣fairs,
arrives in London, and sets up a gay
equipage. He me<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts with Emilia, and is in∣troduced
to her uncle.</HEAD>
<P>HIS aunt, at the earnest solicitation of Julia
and her husband, took up her quarters at
the house of that affectionate kinswoman, who
made it her chief study to comfort and cherish
the disconsolate widow; and Jolter, in expecta∣tion
<PB N="9" REF="14"/>
of the living, which was not yet vacant, re∣mained
in garison, in quality of land-steward
upon our hero's country-estate. As for the lieu∣tenant,
our young gentleman communed with
him, in a serious manner, about the commo∣dore's
proposal of his taking Mrs. Trunnion to
wife; and Jack, being quite tired of the solitary
situation of a batchelor, which nothing but the
company of his old commander could have en∣abled
him to support so long, far from discover∣ing
aversion to the match, observed with an arch
smile, that it was not the first time he had com∣manded
a vessel in the absence of Captain Trun∣nion;
and therefore, if the widow was willing,
he would chearfully stand by her helm, and, as
he hoped the duty would not be of long conti∣nuance,
do his endeavour to steer her safe into
the port, where the commodore might come on
board, and take charge of her again.</P>
<P>In consequence of this declaration, it was de∣termined
that Mr. Hatchway should make his
addresses to Mrs. Trunnion, as soon as decency
would permit her to receive them; and Mr. Clo∣ver
and his wife promised to exert their influence
in his behalf. Mean while, Jack was desired to
live at the castle as usual, and assured, that it
should be put wholly in his possession, as soon as
he should be able to accomplish this matrimonial
scheme.</P>
<P>When Peregrine had settled all these points to
his own satisfaction, he took leave of all his
friends, and repairing to the great city, purchased
a new chariot and horses, put Pipes and another
lacquey into rich liveries, took elegant lodgings
in Pall-mall, and made a most remarkable ap∣pearance
among people of fashion. It was owing
<PB N="10" REF="15"/>
to this equipage, and the gaiety of his personal
deportment, that common fame, which is al∣ways
a common liar, represented him as a young
gentleman who had just succeeded to an estate of
five thousand pounds <HI>per annum,</HI> by the death of
an uncle; that he was intitled to an equal fortune
at the decease of his own father, exclusive of
two considerable jointure<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, which would devolve
upon him, at the demise of his mother and aunt.
This report (false and ridiculous as it was) he
could not find in his heart to contradict; not but
that he was sorry to find himself so misrepre∣sented:
but his vanity would not allow him to
take any step that might diminish his importance
in the opinion of those who courted his ac∣quaintance,
on the supposition that his circum∣stances
were actually as affluent as they were said
to be. Nay, so much was he infatuated by this
weakness, that he resolved to encourage the de∣ception,
by living up to the report; and ac∣cordingly,
engaged in the most expensive parties
of pleasure; believing, that before his present
finances should be exhausted, his fortune would
be effectually made, by the personal accomplish∣ments
he should have occasion to display to the
beau monde, in the course of his extravagance.
In a word, vanity and pride were the ruling foibles
of our adventurer, who imagined himself suffi∣ciently
qualified to retrieve his fortune in various
shapes, long before he could have any idea of
want or difficulty. He thought he should have
it in his power, at any time, to make prize of a
rich heiress, or opulent widow; his ambition had
already aspired to the heart of a young handsome
duchess dowager, to whose acquaintance he had
found means to be introduced: or, should matri∣mony
<PB N="11" REF="16"/>
chance to be unsuitable to his inclinations,
he never doubted, that by the interest he might
acquire among the nobility, he should be favoured
with some lucrative post, that would amply re∣compense
him for the liberality of his disposition.
There are many young men, who entertain the
same expectations, with half the reason he had to
be so presumptuous.</P>
<P>In the midst of these chimerical calculations,
his passion for Emilia did not subside; but, on
the contrary, began to rage to such an inflam∣mation
of desire, that her idea interfered with
every other reflection, and absolutely disabled him
from prosecuting the other lofty schemes which
his imagination had projected. He therefore laid
down the honest resolution of visiting her in all the
splendor of his situation, in order to practise upon
her virtue with all his art and address, to the ut∣most
extent of his influence and fortune. Nay,
so effectually had his guilty passion absorb'd his
principles of honour, conscience, humanity, and
regard for the commodore's last words, that he
was base enough to rejoice at the absence of his
friend Godfrey, who being then with his regi∣ment
in Ireland, could not dive into his purpose,
or take measures for frustrating his vicious
design.</P>
<P>Fraught with these heroic sentiments, he de∣termined
to set out for Sussex in his chariot and
six, attended by his valet de chambre and two
footmen; and as he was now sensible, that in his
last essay he had mistaken his cue, he determined
to change his battery, and sap the fortress, by
the most submissive, soft, and insinuating beha∣viour.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="17"/>
On the evening that preceded this purposed
expedition, he went into one of the boxes at the
play-house, as usual, to shew himself to the la∣dies;
and in reconnoitring the company through
a glass, (for no other reason, but because it was
fashionable to be purblind) perceived his mistress
very plainly dressed, in one of the seats above the
stage, talking to another young woman of a very
homely appearance. Though his heart beat the
alarm with the utmost impatience at sight of his
Emilia, he was for some minutes deterred from
obeying the impulse of his love, by the presence
of some ladies of fashion, who, he feared, would
think the worse of him, should they see him
make his compliments in public to a person of
her figure. Nor would the violence of his incli∣nation
have so far prevailed over his pride, as to
lead him thither, had not he recollected, that his
quality-friends would look upon her as some hand∣some
Abigail, with whom he had an affair of gal∣lantry,
and of consequence gave him credit for
the intrigue.</P>
<P>Encouraged by this suggestion, he complied
with the dictates of love, and slew to the place
where his charmer sat. His air and dress were
so remarkable, that it was almost impossible he
should have escaped the eyes of a curious ob∣server,
especially as he had chosen a time for
coming in, when his entrance could not fail to
attract the notice of the spectators; I mean, when
the whole house was hushed in attention to the
performance on the stage. Emilia, therefore,
had perceived him at his first approach; she found
herself discovered by the direction of his glass,
and guessing his intention by his abrupt retreat
from the box, summoned all her fortitude to her
<PB N="13" REF="18"/>
aid, and prepared for his reception. He advanced
to her with an air of eagerness and joy, tempered
with modesty and respect, and expressed his sa∣tisfaction
at seeing her, with a seeming reverence
of regard. Though she was extremely well pleased
at this unexpected behaviour, she suppressed the
emotions of her heart, and answered his compli∣ments
with affected ease and unconcern, such as
might denote the good humour of a person who
meets by accident with an indifferent acquaint∣ance.
After having certified himself of her own
good health, he very kindly inquired about her
mother and Miss Sophy, gave her to understand,
that he had lately been favoured with a letter
from Godfrey, and that he had actually intended
to set out next morning on a visit to Mrs. Gaunt∣let,
which (now that he was so happy as to meet
with her) he would postpone, until he should
have the pleasure of attending her to the coun∣try.
After having thanked him for his polite in∣tention,
she told him, that her mother was ex∣pected
in town in a few days, and that she her∣self
had come to London some weeks ago, to
give her attendance upon her aunt, who had
been dangerously ill, but was now pretty well
recovered.</P>
<P>Although the conversation of course turned
upon general topics, during the entertainment,
he took all opportunities of being particular with
his eyes, through which he conveyed a thousand
tender protestations. She saw, and inwardly re∣joiced
at the humility of his looks; but, far from
rewarding it with one approving glance, she in∣dustriously
avoided this ocular intercourse, and
rather coquetted with a young gentleman that
ogled her from the opposite box. Peregrine's
<PB N="14" REF="19"/>
penetration easily detected her sentiments, and
he was nettled at her dissimulation, which serv∣ed
to confirm him in his unwarrantable designs
upon her person. He persisted in his assiduities
with indefatigable perseverance; when the play
was concluded, handed her and her companion to
an hackney-coach, and with difficulty was per∣mitted
to escort them to the house of Emilia's
uncle, to whom our hero was introduced by the
young lady, as an intimate friend of her brother
Godfrey.</P>
<P>The old gentleman, who was no stranger to
the nature of Peregrine's connexion with his
sister's family, prevailed upon him to stay supper,
and seemed particularly well pleased with his con∣versation
and deportment, which, by help of his
natural sagacity, he wonderfully adapted to the
humour of his entertainer. After supper, when
the ladies were withdrawn, and the citizen called
for his pipe, our sly adventurer followed his ex∣ample;
and though he abhorred the plant, smoak∣ed
with an air of infinite satisfaction, and expa∣tiated
upon the virtues of tobacco, as if he had
been deeply concerned in the Virginia trade. In
the progress of the discourse, he consulted the
merchant's disposition; and the national debt
coming upon the carpet, held forth upon the
funds like a professed broker. When the alder∣man
complained of the restrictions and discou∣ragement
of trade, his guest inveighed against
exorbitant duties, with the nature of which he
seemed as well acquainted as any commissioner
of the customs; so that the uncle was astonished
at the extent of his knowledge, and expressed
his surprize, that a gay young gentleman, like
him, should have found either leisure or inclina∣tion
<PB N="15" REF="20"/>
to consider subjects so foreign to the fashion∣able
amusements of youth.</P>
<P>Pickle laid hold on this opportunity to tell
him, that he was descended from a race of mer∣chants;
and that, early in life, he had made it
his business to instruct himself in the different
branches of trade, which he not only studied as
his family-profession, but also as the source of
all our national riches and power. He then
launched out in praise of commerce, and the pro∣moters
thereof; and, by way of contrast, em∣ployed
all his ridicule, in drawing such ludicrous
pictures of the manners and education of what is
called high life, that the trader's sides were shaken
by laughter, even to the danger of his life; and
he looked upon our adventurer as a miracle of
sobriety and good sense.</P>
<P>Having thus ingratiated himself with the uncle,
Peregrine took his leave, and next day in the
forenoon visited the niece in his chariot, after
she had been admonished by her kinsman to be∣have
with circumspection, and cautioned against
neglecting or discouraging the addresses of such a
valuable admirer.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He prosecutes his design upon Emilia with great art
and perseverance.</HEAD>
<P>OUR adventurer, having by his hypocrisy
obtained free access to his mistress, began
the siege, by professing the most sincere contri∣tion
for his former levity, and imploring her for∣giveness
with such earnest supplication, that,
<PB N="16" REF="21"/>
guarded as she was against his flattering arts, she
began to believe his protestations, which were
even accompanied with tears, and abated a good
deal of that severity and distance she had pro∣posed
to maintain, during this interview. She
would not, however, favour him with the least
acknowledgment of a mutual passion, because, in
the midst of his vows of eternal constancy and
truth, he did not mention one syllable of wed∣lock,
though he was now intirely master of his
own conduct; and this consideration created a
doubt, which fortified her against all his attacks:
yet, what her discretion would have concealed,
was discovered by her eyes, which, in spite of all
her endeavours, breathed forth complacency and
love. For, her inclination was flattered by her
own self-sufficiency, which imputed her admirer's
silence, in that particular, to the hurry and per∣turbation
of his spirits, and persuaded her, that
he could not possibly regard her with any other
than honourable intentions.</P>
<P>The insidious lover exulted in the tenderness
of her looks, from which he presaged a compleat
victory: but, that he might not over-shoot him∣self
by his own precipitation, he would not run
the risk of declaring himself, until her heart
should be so far entangled within his snares, as
that neither the suggestions of honour, prudence,
or pride should be able to disengage it. Armed
with this resolution, he restrained the impatience
of his temper within the limits of the most deli∣cate
deportment; and after having solicited and
obtained permission to attend her to the next
opera, took her by the hand, and pressing it to
his lips in the most respectful manner, went
away, leaving her in a most whimsical state of
<PB N="17" REF="22"/>
suspence, checquered with an interesting vicissi∣tude
of hope and fear.</P>
<P>On the appointed day, he appeared again about
five o'clock in the afternoon, and found her na∣tive
charms so much improved by the advantages
of dress, that he was transported with admiration
and delight; and while he conducted her to the
Hay market, could scarce bridle the impetuosity
of his passion, so as to observe the forbearing
maxims he had adopted. When she entered the
pit, he had abundance of food for the gratifica∣tion
of his vanity; for, in a moment, she eclipsed
all the female part of the audience, each indi∣vidual
allowing in her own heart, that the stranger
was by far the handsomest woman there present,
except herself.</P>
<P>Here it was that our hero enjoyed a double
triumph; he was vain of this opportunity to en∣hance
his reputation for gallantry among the la∣dies
of fashion, who knew him, and proud of
an occasion to display his quality-acquaintance to
Emilia, that she might entertain the greater idea
of the conquest she had made, and pay the more
deference to his importance in the sequel of his
addresses. That he might profit as much as pos∣sible
by this situation, he went up and accosted
every person in the pit, with whom he ever had
the least communication, whispered and laughed
with an affected air of familiarity, and even
bowed at a distance to some of the nobility, on
the slender foundation of having stood near them
at court, or presented them with a pinch of Rap∣pee
at White's chocolate-house.</P>
<P>This ridiculous ostentation, though now pract∣ised
with a view of promoting his design, was
a weakness that, in some degree, infected the
<PB N="18" REF="23"/>
whole of his behaviour; for nothing gave him
so much joy in conversation, as an opportunity
of giving the company to understand, how
well he was with persons of distinguished rank
and character: he would often (for example)
observe, as it were occasionally, that the duke
of G—was one of the best natured men in
the world, and illustrate his assertion by some in∣stance
of his affability, in which he himself was
concerned: then, by an abrupt transition, he
would repeat some repartee of lady T—, and
mention a certain <HI>bon mot</HI> of the earl of C—,
which was uttered in his hearing.</P>
<P>Abundance of young men, in this manner,
make free with the names, though they have never
had access to the persons of the nobility: but,
this was not the case with Peregrine, who, in
consideration of his appearance and supposed for∣tune,
together with the advantage of his intro∣duction,
was by this time freely admitted to the
tables of the great.</P>
<P>In his return with Emilia from the opera,
though he still maintained the most scrupulous
decorum in his behaviour, he plied her with the
most passionate expressions of love, squeezed her
hand with great servency, protested that his whole
soul was ingrossed by her idea, and that he could
not exist independent of her favour. Pleased as
she was with his warm and pathetic addresses, to∣gether
with the respectful manner of his making
love, she yet had prudence and resolution suffi∣cient
to contain her tenderness, which was ready
to run over; being fortified against his arts, by
reflecting, that if his aim was honourable, it was
now his business to declare it. On this conside∣ration,
she refused to make any serious reply to
<PB N="19" REF="24"/>
his earnest expostulations, but affected to receive
them as the undetermined effusions of gallantry
and good breeding.</P>
<P>This fictitious gaiety and good humour, though
it baffled his hope of extorting from her an ac∣knowledgment
of which he might have taken
immediate advantage, nevertheless encouraged
him to observe, (as the chariot passed along the
Strand) that the night was far advanced; that
supper would certainly be over, before they could
reach her uncle's house; and to propose, that he
should wait upon her to some place, where they
might be accommodated with a flight refreshment.
She was offended at the freedom of this proposal,
which, however, she treated as a joke, thank∣ing
him for his courteous offer, and assuring him,
that when she should be disposed for a tavern-treat,
he alone should have the opportunity of bestow∣ing
it.</P>
<P>Her kinsman being engaged with company abroad,
and her aunt retired to rest, he had the good for∣tune
to enjoy a <HI>téte a tôte</HI> with her during a whole
hour, which he employed with such consummate
skill, that her caution was almost overcome. He
not only affailed her with the artillery of sighs,
vows, prayers and tears, but even pawned his
honour in behalf of his love. He swore with
many imprecations, that although her heart were
surrendered to him at discretion, there was a
principle within him, which would never allow
him to injure such innocence and beauty; and
the transports of his passion had, upon this occa∣sion,
so far overshot his purpose, that if she had
demanded an explanation, while he was thus agi∣tated,
he would have engaged himself to her
wish by such ties, as he could not possibly break,
<PB N="20" REF="25"/>
with any regard to his reputation. But, from
such expostulation, she was deterred partly by
pride, and partly by the dread of finding herself
mistaken in such an interesting conjecture. She
therefore enjoyed the present flattering appearance
of her fate, was prevailed upon to accept the
jewels which he had purchased with part of his
winning at Bath, and with the most inchanting
condescension submitted to a warm embrace,
when he took his leave, after having obtained
permission to visit her, as often as his inclination
and convenience would permit.</P>
<P>In his return to his own lodgings, he was
buoyed up with his success to an extravagance
of hope, already congratulated himself upon his
triumph over Emilia's virtue, and began to pro∣ject
future conquests among the most dignified
characters of the female sex. But his attention
was not at all dissipated by these vain reflections;
he resolved to concentrate the whole exertion of
his soul upon the execution of his present plan,
desisted, in the mean time, from all other schemes
of pleasure, interest and ambition, and took
lodgings in the city, for the more commodious
accomplishment of his purpose.</P>
<P>While our lover's imagination was thus agree∣ably
regaled, his mistress did not enjoy her ex∣pectations,
without the intervention of doubts
and anxiety. His silence touching the final aim
of his addresses was a mystery on which she was
afraid of exercising her sagacity; and her uncle
tormented her with inquiries into the circum∣stances
of Peregrine's professions and deportment.
Rather than give this relation the least cause of
suspicion, which must have cut off all intercourse
betwixt her and her admirer, she said every thing
<PB N="21" REF="26"/>
which she thought would satisfy his care and con∣cern
for her welfare; and in consequence of such
representation, she enjoyed, without reserve, the
company of our adventurer, who prosecuted his
plan with surprising eagerness and perseverance.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He prevails upon Emilia to accompany him to
a masquerade, makes a treacherous attempt
upon her affection, and meets with a deserved
repulse.</HEAD>
<P>SCARCE a night elapsed in which he did
not conduct her to some public entertain∣ment;
and when, by dint of his insidious car∣riage,
he thought himself in full possession of her
confidence and affection, he lay in wait for an op∣portunity;
and hearing her observe in conversa∣tion,
that she had never been at a masquerade,
begged leave to attend her to the next ball; at
the same time, extending his invitation to the
young lady, in whose company he had found her
at the play, she being present when this subject
of discourse was introduced. He had flattered
himself, that this gentlewoman would decline the
proposal, as she was a person seemingly of a de∣mure
disposition, who had been born and bred in
the city, where such diversions are looked upon
as scenes of lewdness and debauchery. For once,
however, he reckoned without his host; curiosity
is as prevalent in the city as at the court-end of
the town: Emilia no sooner signified her assent
to his proposal, than her friend, with an air of
satisfaction, agreed to make one of the <HI>partie;</HI>
and he was obliged to thank her for that com∣plaisance
<PB N="22" REF="27"/>
which laid him under infinite mortifica∣tion.
He set his genius at work, to invent some
scheme for preventing her unseasonable intrusion.
Had an opportunity offered, he would have acted
as her physician, and administered a medicine
that would have laid her under the necessity of
staying at home: but his acquaintance with her
being too slight to furnish him with the means of
executing this expedient, he devised another,
which was practised with all imaginable success.
Understanding that her grandmother had left her
a sum of money independent of her parents, he
conveyed a letter to her mother, intimating, that
her daughter, on pretence of going to the masque∣rade,
intended to bestow herself in marriage to
a certain person, and that in a few days she would
be informed of the circumstances of the whole
intrigue, provided she would keep this informa∣tion
secret, and contrive some excuse for de∣taining
the young lady at home, without giving
her cause to believe she was apprized of her in∣tention.
This billet, subscribed, <HI>Your well-wisher
and unknown humble servant,</HI> had the de∣sired
effect upon the careful matron, who, on the
ball-day, seigned herself so extremely ill, that
miss could not, with any decency, quit her
mamma's apartment; and therefore sent her apo∣logy
to Emilia in the afternoon, immediately after
the arrival of Peregrine, who pretended to be
very much afflicted with the disappointment,
while his heart throbbed with a transport of joy.</P>
<P>About ten o'clock the lovers set out for the
Hay-market, he being dressed in the habit of
Pantaloon, and she in that of Columbine; and
they had scarce entered the house, when the
music struck up, the curtain was withdrawn, and
<PB N="23" REF="28"/>
the whole scene displayed at once, to the admi∣ration
of Emilia, whose expectation was infi∣nitely
surpassed by this exhibition. Our gallant
having conducted her through all the different
apartments, and described the oeconomy of the
place, led her into the circle, and, in their turn,
they danced several minuets; then going to the side∣board,
he prevailed upon her to eat some sweet-meets
and drink a glass of Champagne; and,
after a second review of the company, they en∣gaged
in country-dances, at which exercise they
continued, until our adventurer concluded, that
his partner's blood was sufficiently warmed for
the prosecution of his design. On this supposi∣tion,
which was built upon her declaring, that
she was thirsty and fatigued, he persuaded her to
take a little refreshment and repose; and for that
purpose, handed her down stairs into the eating-room,
where having seated her on the floor, he
presented her with a glass of wine and water;
and as she complained of being faint, enriched
the draught with some drops of a certain elixir,
which he recommended as a most excellent re∣storative,
though it was no other than a stimu∣lating
tincture, which he had treacherously pro∣vided
for the occasion. Having swallowed this
potion, by which her spirits were manifestly ex∣hilerated,
she ate a slice of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am with the wing of
a cold pullet, and concluded the meal with a
glass of Burgundy, which she drank at the earnest
intreaty of her admirer. These extraordinary
cordials co-operating with the ferment of her
blood, which was heated by violent motion,
could not fail to affect the constitution of a deli∣cate
young creature, who was naturally sprightly
and volatile. Her eyes began to sparkle with un∣usual
<PB N="24" REF="29"/>
fire and vivacity, a thousand brilliant sallies
of wit escaped her, and every mask that accosted
her, underwent some smarting repartee.</P>
<P>Peregrine, overjoyed at the success of his ad∣ministration,
proposed that they should resume
their places at the country-dances, with a view
to promote and assist the efficacy of his elixir;
and when he thought her disposition was properly
adapted for the theme, began to ply her with all
the elocution of love. In order to elevate his
own spirits to that pitch of resolution which his
scheme required, he drank two whole bottles of
Burgundy, which inflamed his passion to such a
degree, that he found himself capable of under∣taking
and perpetrating any scheme for the grati∣fication
of his desire.</P>
<P>Emilia, warmed by so many concurring in∣centives,
in savour of the man she loved, abated
considerably of her wonted reserve, listened to
his protestations with undissembled pleasure, and
in the confidence of her satisfaction, even owned
him absolute master of her affections. Ravished
with this confession, he now deemed himself on
the brink of reaping the delicious fruits of his art
and assiduity; and the morning being already
pretty far advanced, assented with rapture to the
first proposal she made of retiring to her lodgings.
The blinds of the chariot being pulled up, he
took advantage of the favourable situation of her
thoughts; and on pretence of being whimsical,
in consequence of the wine he had swallowed,
clasped her in his arms, and imprinted a thou∣sand
kisses on her pouting lips, a freedom which
the pardoned as the privilege of intoxication.
While he thus indulged himself with impunity,
the carriage halted, and Pipes opening the door,
<PB N="25" REF="30"/>
his master handed her into the passage, before she
perceived that it was not her uncle's house, at
which they had alighted.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this discovery, she with some con∣fusion
desired to know his reason for conducting
her to a strange place at these hours: but he
made no reply, until he had led her into an apart∣ment,
when he gave her to understand, that as
her uncle's family must be disturbed by her going
thither so late in the night, and the streets near
Temple-bar were infested by a multitude of rob∣bers
and cut-throats, he had ordered his coach∣man
to halt at this house, which was kept by a
relation of his, a mighty good sort of a gentle∣woman,
who was proud of an opportunity to
accommodate a person for whom he was known
to entertain such tenderness and esteem.</P>
<P>Emilia had too much penetration to be im∣posed
upon by this plausible pretext: in spite of
her partiality for Peregrine, which had never been
inflamed to such a pitch of complacency before,
she comprehended his whole plan in a twinkling;
and though her blood boiled with indignation,
thanked him, with an affected air of serenity, for
his kind concern, and expressed her obligation to
his cousin; but, at the same time, insisted upon
going home, lest her absence should terrify her
uncle and aunt, who she knew would not retire
to rest, till her return.</P>
<P>He urged her, with a thousand remonstrances,
to consult her own ease and safety, promising to
send Pipes into the city, for the satisfaction of her
relations: but finding her obstinately deaf to his
intreaties, he assured her, that he would in a few
minutes comply with her request; and, in the
mean time, begg'd she would fortify herself against
<PB N="26" REF="31"/>
the cold with a cordial, which he poured out in
her presence, and which (now that her suspi∣cion
was aroused) she refused to taste, notwith∣standing
all his importunities. He then fell upon
his knees before her, and the tears gushing from his
eyes, swore that his passion was wound up to such
a pitch of impatience, that he could no longer live
upon the unsubstantial food of expectation; and
that, if she would not vouchsafe to crown his happi∣ness,
he would forthwith sacrifice himself to her dis∣dain.
Such an abrupt address, accompanied with
all the symptoms of frantic agitation, could not
fail to perplex and affright the gentle Emilia,
who, after some recollection, replied with a re∣solute
tone, that she could not see what reason
he had to complain of her reserve, which she was
not at liberty to lay intirely aside, until he should
have avowed his intentions in form, and ob∣tained
the sanction of those whom it was her duty
to obey. “Divine creature! (cried he, seizing
her hand, and pressing it to his lips) it is from
you alone I hope for that condescension, which
would overwhelm me with transports of celestial
bliss. The sentiments of parents are sordid, silly,
and confined; seek not then to subject my pas∣sion
to such low restrictions as were calculated
for the purposes of common life. My love is too
delicate and refined, to wear those vulgar setters,
which serve only to destroy the merit of volun∣tary
affection, and to upbraid a man incessantly
with the articles of compulsion, under which he
lies. My dear angel! spare me the mortification
of being compelled to love you, and reign sole
empress of my heart and fortune. I will not af∣front
you so much as to talk of settlements; my
<PB N="27" REF="32"/>
all is at your disposal. In this pocket-pook are
notes to the amount of two thousand pounds;
do me the pleasure to accept of them; to-morrow
I will lay ten thousand more in your lap. In
a word, you shall be mistress of my whole estate,
and I shall think myself happy in living dependent
on your bounty!”</P>
<P>Heavens! what were the emotions of the vir∣tuous,
the sensible, the delicate, the tender Emi∣lia's
heart, when she heard this insolent declara∣tion
from the mouth of a man, whom she had
honoured with her affection and esteem! It was
not simply horror, grief, or indignation that she
felt, in consequence of this unworthy treatment,
but the united pangs of all together, which pro∣duced
a sort of hysteric laugh, while she told
him, that she could not help admiring his gene∣rosity.</P>
<P>Deceived by this convulsion, and the ironical
compliment that attended it, the lover thought
he had already made great progress in his opera∣tions,
and that it was now his business to storm
the fort by a vigorous assault, that he might spare
her the confusion of yielding without resistance.
Possessed by this vain suggestion, he started up,
and folding her in his arms, began to obey the
furious dictates of his unruly and ungenerous de∣fire;
upon which, with an air of cool determi∣nation,
she demanded a parley; and when, upon
her repeated request, he granted it, addressed her∣self
to him in these words, while her eyes gleam∣ed
with all the dignity of the most awful resent∣ment.
“Sir, I scorn to upbraid you with a re∣petition
of your former vows and protestations,
nor will I recapitulate the little arts you have
practised to ensnare my heart; because, though
<PB N="28" REF="33"/>
by dint of the most persidious dissimulation, you
have found means to deceive my opinion, your
utmost efforts have never been able to lull the vi∣gilance
of my conduct, or to engage my affec∣tion
beyond the power of discarding you without
a tear, whenever my honour should demand such
a sacrifice. Sir, you are unworthy of my con∣cern
or regret, and the sigh that now struggles
from my breast, is the result of sorrow, for my
own want of discernment. As for your present
attempt upon my chastity, I despise your power,
as I detest your intention. Though, under the
mask of the most delecate respect, you have de∣coyed
me from the immediate protection of my
friends, and contrived other impious stratagems
to ruin my peace and reputation, I conside too
much in my own innocence, and the authority
of the law, to admit one thought of fear, much
less to sink under the horror of this shocking si∣tuation,
into which I have been seduced. Sir,
your behaviour on this occasion, is in all respects
low and contemptible: for, ruffian as you are,
you durst not harbour one thought of executing
your execrable scheme, while you knew my bro∣ther
was near enough to prevent, or revenge the
insult; so that you must not only be a treacherous
villain, but also a most despicable coward.”
Having expressed herself in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> manner, with a
most majestic severity of aspect, she opened the
door, and walked down stairs with surprising re∣solution,
committed herself to the care of a
watchman, who accommodated her with a hack∣ney-chair,
in which she was sasely conveyed to
her uncle's house.</P>
<P>Mean while, the lover was so confounded and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver-awed, by these cutting reproaches, and her
<PB N="29" REF="34"/>
animated behaviour, that all his resolution for∣sook
him, and he found himself not only inca∣pable
of obstructing her retreat, but even of ut∣tering
one syllable to deprecate her wrath, or ex∣tenuate
the guilt of his own conduct. The na∣ture
of his disappointment, and the keen remorse
that seized him, when he reflected upon the dis∣honourable
predicament in which his character
stood with Emilia, raised such perturbation in
his mind, that his silence was succeeded by a vio∣lent
fit of distraction, during which he raved like
a Bedlamite, and acted a thousand extravagancies,
which convinced the people of the house, (a cer∣tain
bagnio) that he had actually lost his wits.
Pipes, with great concern, adopted the same opi∣nion;
and, being assisted by the waiters, hin∣dered
him, by main force, from running out and
pursuing the fair fugitive, whom, in his delirium,
he alternately cursed and commended, with hor∣rid
imprecations, and lavish applause. His faith∣ful
valet, having waited two whole hours, in hope
of seeing this gust of passion overblown, and per∣ceiving
that the paroxysm seemed rather to in∣crease,
very prudently sent for a physician of his
master's acquaintance, who having considered the
circumstances and symptoms of the disorder, di∣rected,
that he should be plentifully blooded,
without loss of time, and prescribed a draught to
compose the tumult of his spirits. These orders
being punctually performed, he grew more calm
and tractable, recovered his reflection so far, as
to be ashamed of the extasy he had undergone,
suffered himself quietly to be undressed, and put
to bed, where the fatigue occasioned by his exer∣cise
at the masquerade, co-operated with the pre∣sent
dissipation of his spirits to lull him in a pro∣found
<PB N="30" REF="35"/>
found sleep, which greatly tended to the preser∣vation
of his intellects: not that he found him∣self
in a state of perfect tranquillity, when he
waked about noon; the remembrance of what
had passed overwhelmed him with mortification.
Emilia's invectives still sounded in his ears; and
while he deeply resented her disdain, he could
not help admiring her spirit, and in his heart did
homage to her charms.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">He endeavours to reconcile himself to his mistress,

<P>IN this state of division, he went home to his

with himself, whether he should relin∣quish

nature of the contents; and opening the seal
with disordered eagerness, found the jewels he
had given to her, inclosed in a billet couched in
these words.</P>
<P>“THAT I may have no cause to reproach
myself with having retained the least me∣morial
of a wretch whom I equally despise and
abhor, I take this opportunity of restoring these
<PB N="31" REF="36"/>
ineffectual instruments of his infamous design
upon the honour of Emilia.”</P>
<P>His chagrin was so much galled and inflamed
by the bitterness of this contemptuous message,
that he gnawed his fingers, till the blood ran over
his nails, and even wept with vexation. Some∣times
he vowed revenge against her haughty vir∣tue,
and reviled himself for his precipitate decla∣ration,
before his scheme was brought to matu∣rity;
then he would consider her behaviour with
reverence and regard, and bow before the irre∣sistible
power of her attractions. In short, his
breast was torn by conflicting passions; love,
shame, and remorse contended with vanity, am∣bition,
and revenge; and the superiority was still
doubtful, when headstrong desire interposed, and
decided in favour of an attempt towards a recon∣ciliation
with the offended fair.</P>
<P>Impelled by this motive, he set out in the af∣ternoon
for the house of her uncle, not without
hopes of that tender enjoyment, which never
fails to attend an accommodation betwixt two lo∣vers
of taste and sensibility. Though the con∣sciousness
of his trespass encumbered him with an
air of awkward confusion, he was too confident
of his own qualifications and address to despair of
forgiveness; and by that time he arrived at the
citizen's gate, he had conned a very artful and
pathetic harangue, which he proposed to utter
in his own behalf, laying the blame of his conduct
on the impetuosity of his passion, incensed by the
Burgundy, which he had too liberally drank:
but he did not meet with an opportunity to avail
himself of this preparation. Emilia, suspecting that
he would take some step of this kind to retrieve
<PB N="32" REF="37"/>
her favour, had gone abroad on pretence of vi∣siting,
after having signified to her kinsman, her
resolution to avoid the company of Peregrine, on
account of some ambiguities which (she said)
were last night remarkable in his demeanour, at
the masquerade. She chose to insinuate her sus∣picions
in these hints, rather than give an expli∣cit
detail of the young man's dishonourable con∣trivance,
which might have kindled the resent∣ment
of the family to some dangerous pitch of
animosity and revenge.</P>
<P>Our adventurer, finding himself baffled in his
expectation of seeing her, inquired for the old
gentleman, with whom he thought he had in∣fluence
enough to make his apology good, in case
he should find him prepossessed by the young la∣dy's
information. But here too he was disap∣pointed;
the uncle had gone to dine in the coun∣try,
and his wife was indisposed; so that he had
no pretext for staying in the house, till the return
of his charmer. Being, however, fruitful of ex∣pedients,
he dismissed his chariot, and took pos∣session
of a room in a tavern, the windows of
which fronted the merchant's gate; and there
he proposed to watch until he should see her ap∣proach.
This scheme he put in practice with
indefatigable patience, though it was not attend∣ed
with the expected success.</P>
<P>Emilia, whose caution was equally vigilant and
commendable, foreseeing that she might be ex∣posed
to the fertility of his invention, came home
by a private passage, and entered by a postern,
which was altogether unknown to her admirer;
and her uncle did not arrive, until it was so late,
that he could not with any decency demand a
conference.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="38"/>
Next morning, he did not fail to present him∣self
at the door, and his mistress being denied by
her own express direction, insisted upon seeing
the master of the house, who received him with
such coldness of civility, as plainly gave him to
understand, that he was acquainted with the dis∣pleasure
of his niece. He therefore, with an air
of candour, told the citizen, he could easily per∣ceive,
by his behaviour, that he was the confi∣dant
of Miss Emily, of whom he was come to
ask pardon for the offence he had given; and did
not doubt, if he could be admitted to her pre∣sence,
that he should be able to convince her,
that he had not erred intentionally, or at least
propose such reparation, as would effectually
atone for his fault.</P>
<P>To this remonstrance the merchant, without
any ceremony or circumlocution, answered, that
though he was ignorant of the nature of his of∣fence,
he was very certain, that it must have
been something very flagrant, that could irritate
his niece to such a degree, against a person for
whom she had formerly a most particular regard.
He owned, she had declared her intention to re∣nounce
his acquaintance for ever, and, doubtless,
she had good reason for so doing; neither would
he undertake to promote an accommodation, un∣less
he would give him full power to treat on the
score of matrimony, which he supposed would be
the only means of evincing his own sincerity, and
obtaining Emilia's forgiveness.</P>
<P>Peregrine's pride was kindled by this blunt de∣claration,
which he could not help considering as
the result of a scheme concerted betwixt the
young lady and her uncle, in order to take the ad∣vantage
of his heat. He therefore replied, with
<PB N="34" REF="39"/>
manifest signs of disgust, that he did not appre∣hend
there was any occasion for a mediator to
reconcile the difference betwixt Emilia and him;
and that all he desired, was an opportunity of
pleading in his own behalf.</P>
<P>The citizen frankly told him, that as his niece
had expressed an earnest desire of avoiding his
company, he would not put the least constraint
upon her inclination; and in the mean time gave
him to know, that he was particularly engaged.</P>
<P>Our hero glowing with indignation at this su∣percilious
treatment; “I was in the wrong (said
he) to look for good manners, so far on this side
of Temple-bar: but, you must give me leave to
tell you, Sir, that unless I am favoured with an
interview with Miss Gauntlet, I shall conclude,
that you have actually laid a constraint upon her
inclination, for some sinister purposes of your
own.” “Sir, (replied the old gentleman) you
are welcome to make what conclusions shall seem
good unto your own imagination; but, pray be
so good as to allow me the privilege of being
master in my own house.” So saying, he very
complaisantly shewed him to the door; and our
lover, being diffident of his own temper, as well
as afraid of being used with greater indignity, in
a place where his personal prowess would only
serve to heighten his disgrace, quitted the house
in a transport of rage which he could not wholly
suppress, telling the landlord, that if his age did
not protect him, he would have chastised him for
his insolent behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He projects a violent scheme, in consequence of
which he is involved in a most fatiguing adven∣ture,
which greatly tends towards the augmenta∣tion
of his chagrin.</HEAD>
<P>THUS debarred of personal communication
with his mistress, he essayed to retrieve her
good graces by the most submissive and pathetic
letters, which he conveyed by divers artifices to
her perusal; but reaping no manner of benefit
from these endeavours, his passion acquired a de∣gree
of impatience, little inferior to downright
frenzy; and he determined to run every risk of
life, fortune, and reputation, rather than desist
from his unjustifiable pursuit. Indeed his resent∣ment
was now as deeply concerned as his love,
and each of these passions equally turbulent and
loud in demanding gratification. He kept centi∣nels
continually in pay, to give him notice of her
outgoings, in expectation of finding some oppor∣tunity
to carry her off; but her circumspection
entirely frustrated this design; for she suspected
every thing of that sort from a disposition like
his, and regulated her motions accordingly.</P>
<P>Baffied by her prudence and penetration, he
altered his plan, and, on pretence of being called
to his country-house by some affair of importance,
he departed from London, and taking lodgings at
a farmer's house, that stood near the road through
which she must have necessarily passed, in her
return to her mother, concealed himself from all
intercourse, except with his valet de chambre
and Pipes, who had orders to scour the country,
<PB N="36" REF="41"/>
and reconnoitre every horse, coach, or carriage,
that should appear on that high way, with a view
of intercepting his Amanda in her passage.</P>
<P>He had waited in this ambuscade a whole week,
when his valet gave him notice, that he and his
fellow-scout had discovered a chaise and six, dri∣ving
at full speed towards them; upon which,
they had flapped their hats over their eyes, so as
that they might not be known, in case they
should be seen, and concealed themselves behind
a hedge, from whence they could perceive in the
carriage, as it passed, a young man plainly dressed,
with a lady in a mask, of the exact size, shape, and
air of Emilia; and that Pipes followed them at a
distance, while he rode back to communicate this
piece of intelligence.</P>
<P>Peregrine would scarce allow him time to con∣clude
his information; he ran down to the stable,
where his horse was kept ready saddled for the
purpose, and never doubting that the lady in
question was his mistress, attended by one of her
uncle's clerks, mounted immediately, and rode
full gallop after the chaise, which (when he had
proceeded about two miles) he understood from
Pipes, had put up at a neighbouring inn. Though
his inclination prompted him to enter her apart∣ment
without farther delay, he suffered himself
to be dissuaded from taking such a precipitate
step, by his privy counsellor, who observed, that
it would be impracticable to execute his purpose
of conveying her against her will from a public
inn, that stood in the midst of a populous village,
which would infallibly rise in her defence; and
advised him to lie in wait for the chaise, in some
remote and private part of the road, where they
might accomplish their aim without difficulty or
<PB N="37" REF="42"/>
danger. In consequence of this admonition, our
adventurer ordered Pipes to reconnoitre the inn,
that she might not escape another way, while he
and the valet, in order to avoid being seen, took
a circuit by an unfrequented path, and placed
themselves in ambush, on a spot which they chose
for the scene of their atchievement. Here they
tarried a full hour, without seeing the carriage,
or heating from their centinel; so that the youth,
unable to exert his patience one moment longer,
lest the foreigner in his station, and rode back to
his faithful lacquey, who assured him, that the
travellers had not yet have up their anchor, or
proceeded on their voyage.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding this intimation, Pickle began
to entertain such alarming suspicions, that he
could not refrain from advancing to the gate,
and inquiring for the company which had lately
arrived in a chaise and six. The inn-keeper,
who was not at all pleased with the behaviour of
those passengers, did not think proper to observe
the instructions he had received; on the con∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ary,
he plainly told him, that the chaise did not
halt, but only entered at one door, and went
out at the other, with a view to deceive those
who pursued it, as he guessed from the words of
the gentleman, who had earnestly desired, that
his route might be concealed from any person who
should inquire about their motions. “As for
my own peart, measter, (continued this chari∣table
publican) I believes as <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow they are no
better than they should be, else they wouldn't be
in such a deadly fear of being overtaken. Me∣thinks,
(said I) when I saw them in such a
woundy pother to be gone, oddsheartikins! this
must be some Lundon prentice running away with
<PB N="38" REF="43"/>
this measter's daughter, as sure as I'm a living
soul. But, be he who will, sartain it is, a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
has nothing of the gentleman about en; for,
thos a axed such a savour, a never once put hand
in pocket, or said, “Dog, will you drink?”
Howsomever, that don't argufy in reverence of
his being in a hurry; and a man may be some∣times
a little too judgmatical in his conjunctures.”
In all probability, this loquacious landlord would
have served the travellers effectually, had Pere∣grine
heard him to an end; but this impetuous
youth, far from listening to the sequel of his ob∣servations,
interrupted him in the beginning of
his career, by asking eagerly, which road they
followed; and having received the inn-keeper;
directions, clapp'd spurs to his horse, command∣ing
Pipes to make the valet acquainted with his
course, that they might attend him with all ima∣ginable
dispatch.</P>
<P>By the publican's account of their conduct,
his former opinion was fully confirmed; he plied
his steed to the height of his mettle, and so much
was his imagination ingrossed by the prospect of
having Emilia in his power, that he did not per∣ceive
the road on which he travelled, was quite
different from that which led to the habitation of
Mrs. Gauntlet. The valet de chambre was at
utter stranger to that part of the country; an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as for Mr. Pipes, such considerations were alto∣gether
foreign to the oeconomy of his reflection.</P>
<P>Ten long miles had our hero rode, when hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
eyes were blessed with the fight of the chaise as∣cending
an hill, at the distance of a good league<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
upon which, he doubled his diligence in such:
manner, that he gained upon the carriage eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
minute, and at length approached so near to i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="39" REF="44"/>
that he could discern the lady and her conductor,
with their heads thrust out at the windows, look∣ing
back, and speaking to the driver alternately,
as if they earnestly besought him to augment the
speed of his cattle.</P>
<P>Being thus, as it were, in fight of port, while
he crossed the road, his horse happened to plunge
into a cart-rut, with such violence, that he was
thrown several yards over his head; and the
beast's shoulder being slipt by the fall, he found
himself disabled from plucking the fruit, which
was almost within his reach; for he had left his
servants at a considerable distance behind him;
and although they had been at his back, and sup∣plied
him with another horse, they were so in∣differently
mounted, that he could not reasonably
expect to overtake the flyers, who profited so
much by this disaster, that the chaise vanished in
a moment.</P>
<P>It may be easily conceived, how a young man
of his disposition passed his time, in this tanta∣lizing
situation. He ejaculated with great fer∣vency,
but his prayers were not the effects of re∣signation.
He ran back on foot with incredible
speed, in order to meet his valet, whom he un∣horsed
in a twinkling; and taking his seat, be∣gan
to exercise his whip and spurs, after having
ordered the Swiss to follow him on the other
gelding, and commit the lame hunter to the care
of Pipes.</P>
<P>Matters being adjusted in this manner, our
adventurer prosecuted the race with all his might;
and having made some progress, was informed
by a countryman, that the chaise had struck off
into another road, and, according to his judg∣ment,
was by that time about three miles ahead;
<PB N="40" REF="45"/>
though, in all probability, the horses would not
be able to hold out much longer, because they
seemed to be quite spent when they passed his
door. Encouraged by this intimation, Peregrine
pushed on with great alacrity; though he could
not regain fight of the desired object, till the
clouds of night began to deepen, and even then
he enjoyed nothing more than a transient glimpse;
for the carriage was no sooner seen, than shroud∣ed
again from his view. These vexatious cir∣cumstances
animated his endeavours, while they
irritated his chagrin; and in short, he continued
his pursuit till the night was far advanced, and
himself so uncertain about the object of his care,
that he entered a solitary inn, with a view of ob∣taining
some intelligence, and to his infinite joy,
perceived the chaise standing by itself, and the
horses panting in the yard. In full confidence
of his having arrived at last at the goal of all his
wishes, he alighted instantaneously, and running
up to the coachman, with a pistol in his hand,
commanded him, in an imperious tone, to con∣duct
him to the lady's chamber, on pain of death.
The driver, affrighted at this menacing address,
protested with great humility, that he did not know
whither his fare had retired; for that he himself
was paid and dismissed from this service, because he
would not undertake to drive them all night cross
the country, without stopping to refresh his horses:
but he promised to go in quest of the waiter, who
would shew him to their apartment. He was ac∣cordingly
detached on that errand, while our
hero stood centinel at the gate, till the arrival
of his valet de chamb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who joining him by ac∣cident,
before the coachman returned, relieved
him in his watch; and then the young gentle∣man,
<PB N="41" REF="46"/>
man, exasperated at his messenger's delay, rushed
with fury in his eyes from room to room, de∣nouncing
vengeance upon the whole family; but
he did not meet with one living soul, until he en∣rered
the garret, where he found the landlord and
his wife in bed. This chicken-hearted couple,
by the light of a rush-candle that burned on the
hearth, seeing a stranger burst into the chamber,
in such a terrible attitude, were seized with con∣sternation;
and exalting their voices, in a most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mentable strain, begg'd for the passion of Christ,
that he would spare their lives, and take all
they had.</P>
<P>Peregrine, guessing from this exclamation, and
the circumstance of their being abed, that they
mistook him for a robber, and were ignorant of
that which he wanted to know, dispelled their
terror, by making them acquainted with the cause
of his visit, and desired the husband to get up
with all possible dispatch, in order to assist and
attend him in his search.</P>
<P>Thus reinforced, he rummaged every corner
of the inn, and at last finding the ostler in the
stable, was by him informed, (to his unspeak∣able
mortification) that the gentleman and lady
who arrived in the chaise, had immediately hired
po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t-horses for a certain village at the distance of
fifteen miles, and departed without halting for
the least refreshment. Our adventurer, mad
with his disappointment, mounted his horse in an
in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eant, and, with his attendant, took the same
road, with fall determination to die, rather than
desist from the prosecution of his design. He
had, by this time, rodeupwards of thirty miles since
three o'clock in the afternoon; so that the horses
were almost quite jaded, and travelled this stage
<PB N="42" REF="47"/>
so slowly, that it was morning before they reached
the place of their destination, where, far from
finding the fugitives, he understood, that no such
persons as he described had passed that way, and
that, in all likelihood, they had taken a quite
contrary direction, while, in order to mislead him
in his pursuit, they had amused the hostler with a
false route. This conjecture was strengthned,
by his perceiving (now for the first time) that
he had deviated a considerable way from the road,
through which they must have journeyed, in or∣der
to arrive at the place of her mother's resi∣dence;
and these suggestions utterly deprived him
of the small remains of recollection, which he
had hitherto retained. His eyes rolled about,
witnessing rage and distraction; he foamed at the
mouth, stamped upon the ground with great vio∣lence,
uttered incoherent imprecations against
himself and all mankind, and would have sallied
forth again he knew not whither, upon the same
horse, which he had already almost killed with
fatigue, had not his confident found means to
quiet the tumult of his thoughts, and recal his
reflection, by representing the condition of the
poor animals, and advising him to hire fresh
horses, and ride post across the country, to the
village in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Gauntlet's
habitation, where they should infallibly intercept
the daughter, provided they could get the start
of her upon the road.</P>
<P>Peregrine not only relished, but forthwith
acted in conformity with this good counsel. His
own horses were committed to the charge of the
landlord, with directions for Pipes, in case he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
should come thither in quest of his master; and
a couple of stout geldings being prepared, he and
<PB N="43" REF="48"/>
his valet took the road again, steering their course
according to the motions of the post-boy, who
undertook to be their guide. They had almost
finished the first stage, when they descried a
post-chaise just halting at the inn where they pro∣posed
to change horses; upon which, our adven∣turer,
glowing with a most interesting presage,
put his beast to the full speed, and approached
near enough to distinguish, (as the travellers
quitted the carriage) that he had at last come up
with the very individual persons whom he had
pursued so long.</P>
<P>Flushed with the discovery, he galloped into
the yard so suddenly, that the lady and her con∣ductor
scarce had time to shut themselves up in
a chamber, to which they retreated with great
precipitation; so that the pursuer was now cer∣tain
of having housed his prey. That he might,
however, leave nothing to fortune, he placed
himself upon the stair, by which they had ascended
to the apartment, and sent up his compliments to
the young lady, desiring the favour of being ad∣mitted
to her presence, otherwise he should he
obliged to wave all ceremony, and take that li∣berty
which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he would not give. The servant
having conveyed this message through the key∣hole,
returned with an answer, importing, that
she would adhere to the resolution she had taken,
and perish rather than comply with his will.
Our a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>venturer, without staying to make any
rejoinder to this reply, ran up stairs, and thun∣dering
at the door for entrance, was given to un∣derstand
by the nymph's attendant, that a blun∣derbuss
was ready primed for his reception, and
that he would do well to spare him the necessity
of shedding blood, in defence of a person who
<PB N="44" REF="49"/>
had put herself under his protection. “All the
laws of the land (said he) cannot now untie the
knots by which we are bound together; and
therefore I will guard her as my own property;
so that you had better desist from your fruitless
attempt, and thereby consult your own safety:
for, by the God that made me! I will discharge
my piece upon you, as soon as you set your nose
within the door; and your blood be upon your
own head.” These menaces from a citizen's
clerk, would have been sufficient motives for
Pickle to storm the breach, although they had
not been reinforced by that declaration, which
informed him of Emilia's having bestowed herself
in marriage upon such a contemptible rival. This
sole consideration added wings to his impetuosity,
and he applied his foot to the door with such irre∣sistible
force, as bursted it open in an instant, en∣tering
at the same time with a pistol ready cock'd
in his hand. His antagonist, instead of firing
his blunderbuss, when he saw him approach,
started back, with evident signs of surprize and
consternation, exclaiming, “Lord Jesus! Sir,
you are not the man! and, without doubt, are
under some mistake with regard to us.”</P>
<P>Before Peregrine had time to answer this salu∣tation,
the lady hearing it, advanced to him,
and pulling off a mask, discovered a face which
he had never seen before. The Gorgon's head,
according to the fables of antiquity, never had a
more initantan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous or petrifying effect, than that
which this countenance produced upon the asto∣nished
youth. His eyes were fixed upon this un∣known
object, as if they had been attracted by
the power of inchantment, his feet seemed <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vetted
to the ground, and after having stood mo∣tionless
<PB N="45" REF="50"/>
for the space of a few minutes, he dropped
down in an apoplexy of disappointment and de∣spair.
The Swiss, who had followed him, see∣ing
his master in this condition, lifted him up,
and laying him upon a bed in the next room, let
him blood immediately, without hesitation, be∣ing
always provided with a case of lancets, against
all accidents on the road. To this foresight our
hero, in all probability, was indebted for his life.
By virtue of a very copious evacuation, he re∣covered
the use of his senses; but the complica∣tion
of fatigues, and violent transports which he
had undergone, brewed up a dangerous fever in
his blood; and a physician being called from the
next market-town, several days elapsed before
he would answer for his life.</P>

<P>AT length, however, his constitution over∣came
his disease, though not before it had
in a great measure tamed the fury of his dispo∣sition,
and brought him to a serious consideration
of his conduct. In this humiliation of his spirits,
he reflected with shame and remorse upon his
treachery to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air, the innocent Emilia; he
remembered his former sentiments in her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>avour,
as well as the injunctions of his dying uncle; he
recollected his intimacy with her brother, against
which he had so basely sinned; and revolving all
the circumstances of her conduct, found it so
commendable, spirited, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that he deemed
her an object of sufficient dignity to merit his ho∣nourable
<PB N="46" REF="51"/>
addresses, even though his duty had not
been concerned in the decision: but, obligated as
he was, to make reparation to a worthy family,
which he had so grosly injured, he thought he
could not manifest his reformation too soon; and,
whenever he found himself able to hold the pen,
wrote a letter to Mrs. Gauntlet, wherein he ac∣knowledged,
with many expressions of sorrow and
contrition, that he had acted a part altogether
unbecoming a man of honour, and should never
enjoy the least tranquillity of mind, until he
should have merited her forgiveness. He pro∣tested,
that although his happiness intirely de∣pended
upon the determination of Emilia, he
would even renounce all hope of being blessed
with her favour, if she could point out any other
method of making reparation to that amiable
young lady, but by laying his heart and fortune
at her feet, and submitting himself to her plea∣sure
during the remaining part of his life. He
conjured her, therefore, in the most pathetic
manner, to pardon him, in consideration of his
sincere repentance, and use her maternal influence
with her daughter, so as that he might be per∣mitted
to wait upon her with a wedding-ring, as
soon as his health would allow him to undertake
the journey.</P>
<P>This explanation being dispatched by Pipes,
who had, by this time, found his master, the
young gentleman inquired about the couple whom
he had so unfortunately parsued, and understood
from his valet de chambre, who learn'd the story
from their own mouths, that the lady was the
only daughter of a rich Jew, and her attendant
no other than his apprentice, who had converted
her to christianity, and married her at the same
<PB N="47" REF="52"/>
time; that this secret having taken air, the old
Israelite had contrived a scheme to separate them
for ever; and they being apprized of his inten∣tion,
had found means to elope from his house,
with a view of sheltering themselves in France,
until the affair could be made up: that seeing
three men ride after them with such eagerness
and speed, they never doubted that the pursuers
were her father, accompanied by some friends or
domestics, and on that supposition had fled with
the utmost dispatch and trepidation, until they
had found themselves happily undeceived, at that
very instant, when they expected nothing but
mischief and misfortune: and lastly, the Swiss
gave him to understand, that after having pro∣fessed
some concern for his deplorable situation,
and enjoyed a slight refreshment, they had taken
their departure for Dover, and, in all likelihood,
were safely arrived at Paris.</P>
<P>In four and twenty hours after Pipes was
charged with his commission, he brought back an
answer from the mother of Emilia, couched in
these words.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>“SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received the favour of yours, and am glad,
for your own sake, that you have attained a
due sense and conviction of your unkind and un∣christian
behaviour to poor Emy. I thank God,
none of my children were ever so insulted before.
Give me leave to tell you, Sir, my daughter was
no upstart, without friends or education, but a
young lady as well bred, and better born, than
most private gentlewomen in the kingdom: and
therefore, though you had no esteem for her per∣son,
you ought to have paid some regard to her
<PB N="48" REF="53"/>
family, which (no disparagement to you, Sir) is
more honourable than your own. As for your
proposal, Miss Gauntlet will not hear of it, be∣ing,
that she thinks her honour will not allow her
to listen to any terms of reconciliation; and she
is not yet so destitute, as to embrace an offer to
which she has the least objection. In the mean
time, she is so much indisposed, that she cannot
possibly see company; so I beg you will not take
the trouble of making a fruitless journey to this
place. Perhaps your future conduct may deserve
her forgiveness; and really, as I am concerned
for your happiness, which (you assure me) de∣pends
upon her condescension, I wish with all my
heart it may; and am (notwithstanding all that
has happened)</P>

<P>From this epistle, and the information of his
messenger, our hero learn'd, that his mistress
had actually profited by his wild-goose-chace, so
as to make a safe retreat to her mother's house
and, though sorry to hear of her indisposition, he
was also piqued at her implacability, as well as
at some stately paragraphs of the letter, in which
(he thought) the good lady had consulted her own
vanity rather than her good sense. These motives
of resentment helped him to bear his disappoint∣ment
like a philosopher, especially as he had
now quieted his conscience, in proffering to re∣dress
the injury he had done; and, moreover,
found himself, with regard to his love, in a calm
state of hope and resignation.</P>

A seasonable fit of illness is an excellent me∣dicine
for the turbulence of passion. Such a re∣formation
had the fever produced in the oeconomy
of his thoughts, that he moralized like an apostle,
and projected several prudential schemes for his
future conduct.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as soon as his health was
sufficiently re-established, he took a trip to the
garison, in order to visit his friends; and learn'd
from Hatchway's own mouth, that he had broke
the ice of courtship to his aunt, and that his ad∣dresses
were now fairly afloat; though when he
first declared himself to the widow, after she had
been duly prepared for the occasion, by her niece
and the rest of her friends, she had received his
proposal with a becoming reserve, and piously
wept at the remembrance of her husband, ob∣serving,
that she should never meet with his
follow.</P>
<P>Peregrine promoted the lieutenant's suit with
all his influence; and all Mrs. Trunnion's ob∣jections
to the match being surmounted, it was
determined, that the day of marriage should be
put off for three months, that her reputation
might not suffer by a precipitate engagement.
His next care was to give orders for erecting a
plain marble monument to the memory of his
uncle, on which the following inscription, com∣posed
by the bridegroom, actually appeared in
golden letters.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He returns to London, and meets with Cadwal∣lader,
who entertains him with a curious dia∣logue.</HEAD>
<P>THE young gentleman having performed
these last offices, in honour of his deceased
benefactor, and presented Mr. Jolter to the long∣expected
living, which at this time happened to
be vacant, returned to London, and resumed his
former gaiety: not that he was able to shake
Emilia from his thoughts, or even to remember
her without violent emotions; for, as he reco∣vered
his vigour, his former impatience recurred,
and therefore he resolved to plunge himself head∣long
into some intrigue, that might engage his
passions, and amuse his imagination.</P>
<P>A man of his accomplishments could not fail
to meet with a variety of subjects, on which his
gallantry would have been properly exercised;
and this abundance distracted his choice, which
at any time was apt to be influenced by caprice
and whim. I have already observed, that he had
lifted his view, through a matrimonial perspec∣tive,
as high as a lady of the first quality and di∣stinction;
and now, that he was refused by Miss
Gauntlet, and enjoyed a little respite from the
ag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nies of that flame which her charms had
kindled in his heart, he renewed his assiduities to
her grace; and, though he durst not yet risk an
explanation, enjoyed the pleasure of seeing him∣self
so well received in quality of a particular ac∣quaintance,
that he flattered himself with the be∣lief
of his having made some progress in her
<PB N="52" REF="57"/>
heart; and was confirmed in this conceited no∣tion,
by the assurances of her woman, whom, by
liberal largesses, he retained in his interest, be∣cause
she found means to persuade him, that she
was in the confidence of her lady. But, not∣withstanding
this encouragement, and the san∣guine
suggestions of his own vanity, he dreaded
the thoughts of exposing himself to her ridicule
and resentment, by a premature declaration, and
determined to postpone his addresses, until he
should be more certified of the probability of suc∣ceeding
in his attempt.</P>
<P>While he remained in this hesitation and sus∣pence,
he was one morning very agreeably sur∣prized
with the appearance of his friend Crabtree,
who, by the permission of Pipes, to whom he
was well known, entered his chamber before he
was awake, and, by a violent shake of the
shoulder, disengaged him from the arms of sleep.
The first compliments having mutually passed,
Cadwallader gave him to understand, that he had
arrived in town over-night in the stage-coach
from Bath, and entertained him with such a lu∣dicrous
account of his fellow-travellers, that Pe∣regrine,
for the first time since their parting, in∣dulged
himself in mirth, even to the hazard of
suffocation.</P>
<P>This relation was confined to a curious dia∣logue
that passed betwixt a woollen-draper and
his wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, who were his only companions during
the best part of the journey. The lady laboured
under a Diabetes, in consequence of having used
the waters injudiciously for another complaint;
and, that she might not be an impediment to the
carriage, by ordering it to halt, as often as she
should have occasion to disembogue, she had pro∣vided
<PB N="53" REF="58"/>
herself with a leathern convenience, which
her husband carried in the pocket of his great
coat, conveying it privately to her, when she
found herself necessitated to use it; and after∣wards,
taking the opportunity to empty it out at
the window, when the Misanthrope's head chanced
to be turned another way.</P>
<P>As this couple embarked with Crabtree, in the
full persuasion of his being utterly bereft of the
sense of hearing, they kept no sort of reserve in
their conversation; and at last fairly quarrelled,
on account of the good man's want of alertness,
in handing the commodity, when his help-mate's
occasions were so extremely pressing, that her
flood-gates gave way, before she was prepared for
the irruption. Smarting with this disagreeable
circumstance, “Odds plague! you nincompoop,
(cried she) you have fumbled so long about the
pot, that I have drenched myself all over. I
wish to God you had received the stream in your
mouth.” “I thank you for your good-will, my
dear, (answered the patient husband) you would
promote me to the honour of being a pissing-post.”
“I'm sure, (retorted his yoke-fellow, snatching
the utensil from his hand) you are fit for no other
post; and, accordingly, suffer yourself to be piss'd
upon by every body. Witness your pitiful beha∣viour
at the E. O. table, when that officer bul∣lied
you out of twenty guineas, which you wan't
obliged to pay.” “There you happen to be
wide of the matter, (said the draper) the whole
company gave it against me, as a fair bett; be∣sides,
the captain threatened to cut my throat,
and I did not choose to give him that trouble.”
“Cut your throat! (exclaimed the virago) I
would a durst: you had a good action against him
<PB N="54" REF="59"/>
for putting you in fear of your life. But you are
a poor tool, good for nothing but squandering
away my money. If you had possessed spirit
enough to follow my advice, you might have been
a deputy of the ward, by this time. But, all
your care is to sit among your companions of the
garden, and sing bunting-songs, till you get drunk,
leaving your trade at sixes and sevens, and your
family to go to the dogs.”</P>
<P>The husband (pacific as he was) being nettled
at these insinuations, frankly told her, that his
affairs had never prospered, since she had per∣suaded
him to swear a book-debt against a gen∣tleman's
executor, after he had been paid by the
deceased. Upon which, her eyes lightened with
fury, and she called him a mean-spirited sorry
fellow, for upbraiding her, a weak woman, with
what she had done for his own good. “Sirrah,
(said she) I suppose you would be base enough
to turn evidence against me, if you thought you
could get any thing by the information, though
that was the only thing you ever did for your
poor family. Who is to provide for my children,
if their father don't?” “And I wish from my
heart their father would provide for them.” (said
the husband, irritated by the epithets she had ut∣tered.)
“An't you their father, Mr. Wiseacre,
(cried the aggressor:) Ha'n't I brought you five
as fine babes as any in the parish?” “Yes, yes,
(replied the other) you have brought me several
very fine children, that must be allowed; but,
whether or not they are of my begetting, is a
question that I am not quite so clear about.”
“How, fellor! (replied the wife) do you doubt
my vartue?” “No, not I, (answered the
shopkeeper) I have no doubts about the matter.
<PB N="55" REF="60"/>
It is a long time since surgeon C—assured me,
that he would suckle upon his thumb all the chil∣dren
I should ever beget; and I have other con∣vincing
reasons to support his opinion.”</P>
<P>These last words had scarce proceeded from his
mouth, when his sweet-blooded spouse, leaving
her duty and obedience on the left hand, and for∣getting
that she was subject to the eye of any un∣concerned
spectator, lifted up the machine she
had just replenished, and made such application
with it to the forehead of her husband, as pressed
the two sides of it together, by which means,
the contents were squirted out in a full stream,
that played upon the visage of the astonished
Misanthrope; and, not satisfied with the ven∣geance
she had taken, she quitted her weapon,
and assaulted him with tooth and nail, exclaim∣ing
all the time, “Ah! you pitiful cuckoldy
scrub, have you the impudence to own to my
face, that you married a woman of my character,
when you knew your own infirmities? You
had a base design upon my fortune, you slave,
although you was sensible that you could never
deserve it. But, I'll be revenged of you, if
there be a man to be had for love or money.”</P>
<P>Thus, far from attempting to clear herself
from the imputation implied in her husband's
words, she construed his declaration into an ac∣knowledgment
of the ill usage she had suffered;
and while she trumpeted her own wrongs, with
great vociferation, exercised her claws with such
rancour and agility, that the poor draper was
fain to roar aloud for assistance; and as Cadwal∣lader
had no inclination to interpose, he would,
in all probability, have met with the fate of Or∣pheus,
had not his cries reached the ears of the
<PB N="56" REF="61"/>
coachman, who descended from his box, and
partly by threats, and partly by intreaties, put an
end to her operations.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Crabtree sounds the duchess, and undeceives Pickle,
who, by an extraordinary accident, becomes ac∣quainted
with another lady of quality.</HEAD>
<P>CRabtree having rehearsed this adventure, in
such a peculiarity of manner, as added in∣finite
ridicule to every circumstance, and re∣peated
every scandalous report which had circu∣lated
at the Bath, after Peregrine's departure,
was informed by the youth, that he harboured a
design upon the person of such a duchess, and
in all appearance had no reason to complain of
his reception; but, that he would not venture
to declare himself, until he should be more as∣certained
of her sentiments: and therefore, he
begg'd leave to depend upon the intelligence of
his friend Cadwallader, who, he knew, was ad∣mitted
to her parties.</P>
<P>The Misan hrope, before he would promise his
assistance, asked if his prospect verged towards
matrimony? and our adventurer (who guessed
the meaning of his question) replaying in the ne∣gative,
he undertook the office of reconnoitring
her inclination, protesting at the same time, that
he would never concern himself in any scheme,
that did not tend to the disgrace and deception of
ail the sex. On these conditions, he espoused
the interest of our hero, and a plan was imme∣diately
concerted, in consequence of which they
met by accident at her grace's table; and Pickle
<PB N="57" REF="62"/>
having stayed all the fore-part of the evening,
and sat out all the company, except the Misan∣thrope
and a certain widow-lady, who was said
to be in the secrets of my lady duchess, went
away, on pretence of an indispensible engage∣ment,
that Crabtree might have a proper oppor∣tunity
of making him the subject of conver∣sation.</P>
<P>Accordingly, he had scarce quitted the apart∣ment,
when this Cynic attending him to the
door, with a look of morose disdain, “Were I
an absolute prince, (said he) and that fellow one
of my subjects, I would order him to be cloath'd
in sack cloth, and he should drive my asses to
water, that his lofty spirit might be lowered to
the level of his deserts. The pride of a peacock
is dewnright self-denial, when compared with
the vanity of that coxcomb, which was naturally
arrogant, but is now rendered altogether into∣lerable
by the reputation he acquired at Bath,
for kicking a bully, outwitting a club of raw
sharpers, and divers other pranks, in the execu∣tion
of which he was more lucky than wise. But
nothing has contributed so much to the increase
of his insolence and self-conceit, as the favour he
found among the ladies. Ay, the ladies, Madam,
I care <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot who knows it: the lad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, who (to
their honour be it spoken) never sail to patronize
foppery and folly, provided they solicit their en∣couragement.
And yet, this dog was not on the
footing of those hermaphroditical animals, who
may be reckoned among the number of waiting-women,
who air your shifts, comb your lap∣dogs,
examine your noses with magnifying glasses,
in order to squeeze out the worms, clean your
teeth-brushes, sweeten your handkerchiefs,
<PB N="58" REF="63"/>
and soften waste paper for your occasions. This
fellow Pickle was entertained for more important
purposes; his turn of duty never came till all
those lapwings were gone to roost; then he
scaled windows, leaped over garden-walls, and
was let in by Mrs. Betty, in the dark. Nay,
the magistrates of Bath complimented him with
the freedom of the corporation, merely because,
through his means, the waters had gained extra∣ordinary
credit; for every female of a tolerable
appearance, that went thither on account of her
sterility, got the better of her complaint, during
his residence at the Bath: and now, the fellow
thinks no woman can withstand his addresses.
He had not been here three minutes, when I
could perceive with half an eye, that he had
marked out your grace for a conquest; I mean
in an honourable way; though the rascal has im∣pudence
enough to attempt any thing.” <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
saying, he fixed his eyes upon the duchess, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(while her face glowed with indignation) turning
to her confidant, expressed herself in these words.
“Upon my life! I believe there is actually some
truth in what this old ruffian says; I have myself
observed that young fellow eying me with a very
particular stare.” “It is not to be at all won∣dered
at, (said her friend) that a youth of his
complexion should be sensible to the charms <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
your grace; but I dare say, he would not pre∣sume
to entertain any, but the most honourable
and respectful sentiments.” “Respectful senti∣ments!
(cried my lady, with a look of ineffable
disdain) if I thought the fellow had assurance
enough to think of me in any shape, I protest <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
would fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d him my house. Upon my honour
such instances of audacity should induce persons
<PB N="59" REF="64"/>
of quality to keep your small gentry at a greater
distance; for they are very apt to grow impu∣dent,
upon the least countenance or encourage∣ment.”</P>
<P>Cadwallader, satisfied with this declaration,
changed the subject of discourse, and next day
communicated his discovery to his friend Pickle,
who, upon this occasion, felt the most stinging
sensations of mortifying pride, and resolved to
quit his prospect with a good grace. Nor did the
execution of this self-denying scheme cost him
one moment's uneasiness; for his heart had never
been interested in the pursuit, and his vanity tri∣umphed
in the thoughts of manifesting his in∣difference.
Accordingly, the very next time he
visited her grace, his behaviour was remarkably
frank, sprightly, and disengaged; and the subject
of love being artfully introduced by the widow,
who had been directed to sound his inclinations,
he rallied the passion with great ease and severity,
and made no scruple of declaring himself heart∣whole.</P>
<P>Though the duchess had resented his supposed
affection, she was now offended at his insensi∣bility,
and even signified her disgust, by ob∣serving,
that perhaps his attention to his own
qualifications screened him from the impression
of all other objects.</P>
<P>While he enjoyed this sarcasm, the meaning
of which he could plainly discern, the company
was joined by a certain virtuoso, who had gained
free access to all the great families of the land,
by his notable talent of gossipping and buffoonery.
He was now in the seventy-fifth year of his age;
his birth was so obscure, that he scarce knew his
father's name, his education suitable to the dig∣nity
<PB N="60" REF="65"/>
of his descent, his character publickly branded
with homicide, profligacy, and breach of trust;
yet this man, by the happy inheritance of im∣pregnable
effrontery, and a lucky prostitution of
all principle, in rendering himself subservient to
the appetites of the great, had attained to an in∣dependency
of fortune, as well as to such a par∣ticular
share of favour among the quality, that
although he was well known to have pimped for
three generations of the nobility, there was not a
lady of fashion in the kingdom, who scrupled to
admit him to her toilette, or even to be squired
by him, in any public place of entertainment.
Not but that this sage was occasionally useful to
his fellow-creatures, by these connexions with
people of fortune; for, he often undertook to
solicite charity in behalf of distressed objects, with
a view of embezzling one half of the benefac∣tions.
It was an errand of this kind that now
brought him to the house of her grace.</P>
<P>After having sat a few minutes, he told the
company, that he would favour them with a very
proper opportunity to extend their benevolence,
for the relief of a poor gentlewoman, who was
reduced to the most abject misery, by the death
of her husband, and just delivered of a couple
of fine boys. They, moreover, understood from
his information, that this object was daughter of
a good family, who had renounced her, in con∣sequence
of her marrying an ensign without a
fortune; and even obstructed his promotion with
all their influence and power; a circumstance of
barbarity, which had made such an impression
upon his mind, as disordered his brain, and drove
him to despair, in a fit of which he had made
<PB N="61" REF="66"/>
away with himself, leaving his wife then big with
child, to all the horrors of indigence and grief.</P>
<P>Various were the criticisms on this pathetic
picture, which the old man drew with great ex∣pression.
My lady duchess concluded, that she
must be a creature void of all feeling and re∣flection,
who could survive such aggravated mi∣sery;
therefore, did not deserve to be relieved,
except in the character of a common beggar;
and was generous enough to offer a recommen∣dation,
by which she would be admitted into an
infirmary, to which her grace was a subscriber;
at the same time, advising the sollicitor to send
the twins to the Foundling-hospital, where they
would be carefully nursed and brought up, so as
to become useful members of the commonwealth.
Another lady, with all due deference to the opi∣nion
of the duchess, was free enough to blame
the generosity of her grace, which would only
serve to encourage children in their disobedience
to their parents, and might be the means not only
of prolonging the distress of the wretched crea∣ture,
but also of ruining the constitution of some
young heir, perhaps the hope of a great family;
for, she did suppose that madam, when her month
should be up, and her brats disposed of, would
spread her attractions to the public, (provided
she could profit by her person) and, in the usual
way, make a regular progress from St. James's
to Drury-lane. She apprehended, for these rea∣sons,
that their compassion would be most effec∣tually
shewn, in leaving her to perish in her pre∣sent
necessity; and that the old gentleman would
be unpardonable, should he persist in his endea∣vours
to relieve her. A third member of this
tender-hearted society, after having asked if the
<PB N="62" REF="67"/>
young woman was handsome? and been answered
in the negative, allowed, that there was
a great deal of reason in what had been said
by the honourable person who had spoke last
nevertheless, she humbly conceived, her sentence
would admit of some mitigation. “Let the
bantlings (said she) be sent to the hospital, ac∣cording
to the advice of her grace, and a small
collection be made for the present support of the
mother; and when her health is recovered,
will take her into my family, in quality of a
upper-servant, or medium between me and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
woman; for, upon my life! I can't endure to
chide, or give directions to a creature, who is
in point of birth and education, but one degree
above the vulgar.”</P>
<P>This proposal met with universal approbation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
The duchess (to her immortal honour) began
the contribution with a crown; so that the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of the company were obliged to restrict their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
berality to half the sum, that her grace might <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
be affronted; and the proposer demanding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
poor woman's name and place of abode, the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

(on more accounts than one) to find <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

his half-crown, however; and retir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
from the company, betook himself to the lodging
of the forlorn lady in the straw, according to the

that she was then visited by some cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ritable
<PB N="63" REF="68"/>
gentlewoman, who had sent for a nurse,
and waited the return of the messenger; and he
sent up his respects, desiring he might be per∣mitted
to see her, on pretence of having been in∣timate
with her late husband.</P>
<P>Though the poor woman had never heard of
his name, she did not think proper to deny his
request; and he was conducted to a paultry
chamber in the third story, where he found this
unhappy widow sitting up in a truckle-bed, and
sockling one of her infants, with the most pi∣teous
expression of anguish in her features, which
were naturally regular and sweet, while the
other was fondled on the knee of a person, whose
attention was so much ingrossed by her little
charge, that for the present she could mind no∣thing
else: and it was not till after the first com∣pliments
passed betwixt the hapless mother and
cat adventurer, that he perceived the stranger's
countenance, which inspired him with the highest
esteem and admiration. He beheld all the graces
of elegance and beauty, breathing sentiment and
beneficence, and softened into the most inchant∣ing
tenderness of weeping sympathy: and when
he declared the cause of his visit, which was no
other than the desire of befriending the distressed
lady, to whom he presented a bank-note for
twenty pounds, he was favoured with such a
look of complacency by this amiable phantom,
who might have been justly taken for an angel
ministering to the necessities of mortals, that his
whole soul was transported with love and vene∣ration.
Nor was this prepossession diminished by
the information of the widow, who, after having
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her gratitude in a flood of tears, told
him, that the unknown object of his esteem was
<PB N="64" REF="69"/>
a person of honour, who having heard by acci∣dent
of her deplorable situation, had immediately
obeyed the dictates of her humanity, and com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
in person to relieve her distress; that she had <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
only generously supplied her with money for pre∣sent
sustenance, but also undertaken to provide<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
nurse for her babes, and even promised to favour her
with protection, should she survive her present me∣lancholy
situation. To these articles of intelli∣gence
she added, that the name of her benefactre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
was the celebrated lady—, to whose character
the youth was no stranger, though he had never
seen her person before. The killing edge of her
charms was a little blunted by the accidents of
time and fortune; but no man of taste and ima∣gination,
whose nerves were not quite chille<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
with the frost of age, could, even at that time
look upon her with impunity: and as Peregrine
saw her attractions heightened by the tender of∣fice
in which she was engaged, he was smitted
with her beauty, and so ravished with her com∣passion,
that he could not suppress his emotions
but applauded her benevolence with all the warmth
of enthusiasm.</P>
<P>Her ladyship received his compliments with
great politeness and affability; and the occasion
on which they met being equally interesting to
both, an acquaintance commenced between them
and they concerted measures for the benefit <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the widow and her two children, one of whom
our hero bespoke for his own godson; for Pick<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
was not so obscure in the beau monde, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
same had reached the ears of this lady, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
therefore, did not discourage his advances toward
her friendship and esteem.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="70"/>
All the particulars relating to their charge being
adjusted, he attended her ladyship to her own
house; and, by her conversation, had the plea∣sure
of finding her understanding suitable to her
other accomplishments. Nor had she any reason
to think, that our hero's qualifications had been
exaggerated by common report.</P>
<P>One of their adopted children died before it was
baptized; so that their care concentered in the
other, for whom they stood sponsors; and un∣derstanding
that the old agent was become trou∣blesome
in his visits to the mother, to whom he
now began to administer such counsel as shocked
the delicacy of her virtue, they removed her into
another lodging, where she would not be ex∣posed
to his machinations; and in less than a
month, our hero learn'd from a nobleman of his
acquaintance, that the hoary pandar had actually
engaged to procure for him, this poor afflicted
gentlewoman; and being frustrated in his inten∣tion,
substituted in her room a nymph from the
purlieus of Covent-garden, that made his lord∣ship
smart severely for the favours she bestowed.</P>
<P>Mean while, Peregrine cultivated his new ac∣quaintance
with all his art and affiduity, pre∣suming,
from the circumstance of her reputation
and fate, as well as on the strength of his own
merit, that, in time, he should be able to indulge
that passion which had begun to glow within his
breast.</P>
<P>As her ladyship had undergone a vast variety of
fortune and adventure, which he had heard in∣distinctly
related, with numberless errors and mis∣representations,
he was no sooner intitled, by
the familiarity of communication, to ask such a
favour, than he earnestly intreated her to enter∣tain
<PB N="66" REF="71"/>
him with the particulars of her story; and,
by dint of importunity, she was at length pre∣vailed
upon (in a select partie) to gratify his cu∣riosity
in these words.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The memoirs of a lady of quality.</HEAD>
<P>BY the circumstances of the story which I am
going to relate, you will be convinced of
my candour, while you are informed of my in∣discretion;
and be enabled, I hope, to perceive,
that howsoever my head may have erred, my
heart hath always been uncorrupted, and that I
have been unhappy, <HI>because I loved, and was a
woman.</HI></P>
<P>I believe I need not observe, that I was the
only child of a man of good fortune, who in∣dulged
me, in my infancy, with all the tender∣ness
of paternal affection; and when I was six
years old, sent me to a private school, where I
stayed till my age was doubled, and became such
a favourite, that I was (even in these early days
carried to all the places of public diversion, the
court itself not excepted; an indulgence that flat∣tered
my love of pleasure, to which I was natu∣rally
addicted, and encouraged those ideas of va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣nity
and ambition, which spring up so early <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
the human mind.</P>
<P>I was lively and good-natured, my imagination
apt to run riot, my heart liberal and disinterested
though I was so obstinately attached to my own
opinions, that I could not well brook contra∣diction;
and in the whole of my disposition, re∣sembled
<PB N="67" REF="72"/>
that of Henry the fifth, as described by
Shakespear.</P>
<P>In my thirteenth year I went to Bath, where
I was first introduced into the world as a wo∣man,
having been intitled to that privilege by
my person, which was remarkably tall for my
years; and there my fancy was quite captivated
by the variety of diversions in which I was con∣tinually
engaged: not that the parties were alto∣gether
new to me, but because I now found my∣self
considered as a person of consequence, and
surrounded by a croud of admirers, who courted
my acquaintance, and fed my vanity with praise
and adulation. In short, whether or not I de∣served
their encomiums, I leave the world to
judge; but my person was commended, and my
talent in dancing met with universal applause.
No wonder then, that every thing appeared joy∣ous
to a young creature, who was so void of ex∣perience
and dissimulation, that she believed every
body's heart as sincere as her own, and every ob∣ject
such as it appeared to be.</P>
<P>Among the swains who sighed, or pretended
to sigh for me, were two that bore a pretty equal
share of my favour; (it was too superficial to de∣serve
the name of love.) One of these was a for∣ward
youth of sixteen, extremely handsome,
lively, and impudent, who attended in quality
of page upon the princess Amelia, who spent
that season at the Bath; the other was a Scotch
nobleman turned of thirty, who was graced with
a red ribbon, and danced particularly well, two
qualifications of great weight with a girl of my
age, whose heart was not deeply interested in the
cause. Nevertheless, the page prevailed over
this formidable rival; though our amour went
<PB N="68" REF="73"/>
no farther than a little flirting, and ceased in∣tirely
when I left the place.</P>
<P>Next year, however, I revisited this agreeable
scene, and passed my time in the same circle of
amusements; in which, indeed, each season at
Bath is exactly resembled by that which succeeds,
allowing for the difference of company, which is
continually varying. There I met with the same
incense, and again had my favourite, who was
a North Briton, and captain of foot, near forty
years of age, and a little lame, an impediment
which I did not discover, until it was pointed out
by some of my companions, who rallied me upon
my choice. He was always chearful, and very
amorous, had a good countenance and an ex∣cellent
understanding, possessed a great deal of
art, and would have persuaded me to marry him,
had I not been restrained by the authority of my
father, whose consent was not to be obtained in
favour of a man of his fortune.</P>
<P>At the same time, many proposals of marriage
were made to my parents; but, as they came
from people whom I did not like, I rejected them
all, being determined to refuse every man who
did not make his addresses to myself in person,
because I had no notion of marrying for any
thing but love.</P>
<P>Among these formal proposers was a Scottish
earl, whose pretensions were broke off by some
difference about settlements; and the son of an
English baron, with whom my father was in
treaty, when he carried me to town, on a visit
to a young lady, with whom I had been intimate
from my infancy. She was just delivered of her
first son, for whom we stood sponsors; so that
this occasion detained us a whole month, during
<PB N="69" REF="74"/>
which, I went to a ball at court on the queen's
birth-day, and there, for the first time, felt what
love and beauty were.</P>
<P>The second son of duke—, who had
just returned from his travels, was dancing with
the princess royal, when a young lady came and
desired me to go and see a stranger, whom all the
world admired: upon which, I followed her into
the circle, and observed this object of admira∣tion.
He was dressed in a coat of white cloth,
faced with blue sattin embroidered with silver, of
the same piece with his waistcoat; his fine hair
hung down his back in ringlets below his waist,
and his hat was laced with silver, and garnished
with a white feather; but his person beggared all
description. He was tall and graceful, neither
corpulent nor meagre, his limbs finely propor∣tioned,
his countenance open and majestic, his
eyes full of sweetness and vivacity, his teeth re∣gular,
and his pouting lips of the complexion of
the damask rose. In short, he was formed for
love, and inspired it wherever he appeared; nor
was he a niggard of his talents, but liberally re∣turned
it; at least what passed for such: for he
had a flow of gallantry, for which many ladies
of this land can vouch from their own expe∣rience:
but he exclaimed against marriage, be∣cause
he had, as yet, met with no woman, to
whose charms he would surrender his liberty,
though a princess of France, and a lady of the
same rank in—, were said to be, at that
time, enamoured of his person.</P>
<P>I went home, totally ingrossed by his idea,
flattering myself, that he had observed me with
some attention; for I was young and new, and
<PB N="70" REF="75"/>
had the good fortune to attract the notice and
approbation of the queen herself.</P>
<P>Next day, being at the opera, I was agreeably
surprised with the appearance of this amiable
stranger, who no sooner saw me enter, than he
approached so near to the place where I sat, that
I overheard what he said to his companions;
and was so happy as to find myself the subject of
his discourse, which abounded with rapturous
expressions of love and admiration.</P>
<P>I could not listen to these transports without
emotion; my colour changed, my heart throbbed
with unusual violence, and mine eyes betrayed
my inclinations in sundry favourable glances,
which he seemed to interpret aright, though he
could not then avail himself of his success, so far
as to communicate his sentiments by speech, be∣cause
we were strangers to each other.</P>
<P>I passed that night in the most anxious suspence,
and several days elapsed, before I saw him again.
At length, however, being at court on a ball∣night,
and determined against dancing, I per∣ceived
him among the croud, and, to my un∣speakable
joy, saw him advance with my lord
P—, who introduced him to my acquaintance.
He soon found means to alter my resolution; and
I condescended to be his partner all the evening;
during which, he declared his passion in the most
tender and persuasive terms that real love could
dictate, or fruitful imagination invent.</P>
<P>I believed his protestations, because I wished
them true, and was an unexperienced girl of fif∣teen.
I complied with his earnest request of
being permitted to visit me, and even invited
him to breakfast next morning; so that you may
imagine (I speak to those that feel) I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not,
<PB N="71" REF="76"/>
that night, enjoy much repose. Such was the
hurry and flutter of my spirits, that I rose at six
to receive him at ten. I dressed myself in a new
pink sattin-gown and my best laced night-cloaths,
and was so animated by the occasion, that if
ever I deserved a compliment upon my looks, it
was my due at this meeting.</P>
<P>The wished-for moment came, that brought
my lover to my view: I was overwhelmed with
joy, modesty, and fear of I knew not what.
We sat down to breakfast, but did not eat. He
renewed his addresses with irresistible eloquence,
and pressed me to accept of his hand, without
farther hesitation: but, to such a precipitate step,
I objected, as a measure repugnant to decency,
as well as to that duty which I owed to my fa∣ther,
whom I tenderly loved.</P>
<P>Though I withstood this premature proposal,
I did not attempt to disguise the situation of my
thoughts; and thus commenced a tender corre∣spondence,
which was maintained by letters while
I remained in the country, and carried on (when
I was in town) by private interviews, twice or
thrice a week, at the house of my milliner, where
such endearments passed as refined and happy lo∣vers
know, and others can only guess. Truth
and innocence prevailed on my side, while his
heart was fraught with sincerity and love. Such
frequent intercourse created an intimacy which
I began to think dangerous, and therefore yielded
to his repeated desire, that we might be united
for ever: nay, I resolved to avoid him, until the
day should be fixed, and very innocently (though
not very wisely) told him my reason for this
determination, which was no other than a
consciousness of my incapacity to refuse him
<PB N="72" REF="77"/>
any thing he should demand as a testimony of my
love.</P>
<P>The time was accordingly appointed, at the
distance of a few days, during which I intended
to have implored my father's consent, though I
had but faint hopes of obtaining it: but, he was
by some means or other apprized of our design,
before I could prevail upon myself to make him
acquainted with our purpose. I had danced with
my lover at the Ridotto on the preceding even∣ing,
and there, perhaps, our eyes betrayed us.
Certain it is, several of lord W—m's relations,
who disapproved of the match, came up and ral∣lied
him on his passion; lord S—k in particu∣lar,
used this remarkable expression, “Nephew,
as much love as you please, but no matri∣mony.”</P>
<P>Next day, the priest being prepared, and the
bridegroom waiting for me at the appointed place,
in all the transports of impatient expectation, I
was, without any previous warning, carried into
the country by my father, who took no notice
of the intelligence he had received, but decoyed
me into the coach, on pretence of taking the
air; and when we had proceeded as far as Turn∣ham<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>green,
gave me to understand, that he
would dine in that place.</P>
<P>There was no remedy: I was obliged to bear
my disappointment, though with an aching heart,
and followed him up stairs into an apartment,
where he told me he was minutely informed of
my matrimonial scheme. I did not attempt to
disguise the truth, but assured him, while the
tears gushed from my eyes, that my want of
courage alone had hindered me from making him
privy to my passion; though I owned, I should
<PB N="73" REF="78"/>
have married lord W—m, even though he
had disapproved of my choice. I reminded him
of the uneasy life I led at home, and frankly ac∣knowledged,
that I loved my admirer too well
to live without him; though if he wou'd favour
me with his consent, I would defer my intention,
and punctually observe any day he should fix for
our nuptials. Mean while, I begged he would
permit me to send a message to lord W—m,
who was waiting in expectation of my coming,
and might (without such notice) imagine I was
playing the jilt. He granted this last request;
in consequence of which, I sent a letter to my lo∣ver,
who, when he received it, had almost fainted
away, believing that I should be locked up in the
country, and snatched for ever from his arms.
Tortured with these apprehensions, he changed
cloaths immediately, and taking horse, resolved
to follow me whithersoever we should go.</P>
<P>After dinner, we proceeded as far as Brent∣ford,
where we lay, intending to be at my fa∣ther's
country-house next night; and my admirer
putting up at the same inn, practised every expe∣dient
his invention could suggest, to procure an
interview; but all his endeavours were unsuccess∣ful,
because I, who little dream'd of his being
so near, had gone to bed upon our first arrival,
overwhelmed with affliction and tears.</P>
<P>In the morning I threw myself at my father's
feet, and conjured him by all the ties of paternal
affection, to indulge me with an opportunity of
seeing my admirer once more, before I should be
conveyed from his wishes. The melancholy
condition in which I preferred this supplication,
melted the tender heart of my parent, who yielded
<PB N="74" REF="79"/>
to my solicitation, and carried me back to town,
for that purpose.</P>
<P>Lord W—m, who had watched our mo∣tions,
and arrived at his own lodgings, before
we alighted at my father's house, obeyed my
summons on the instant, and appeared before me
like an angel. Our faculties were, for some mi∣nutes,
suspended by a conflict of grief and joy.
At length, I recovered the use of speech, and
gave him to understand, that I was come to
town, in order to take my leave of him, by the
permission of my father, whom I had promised
to attend into the country next day, before he
would consent to my return; the chief cause and
pretence of which, was my earnest desire to con∣vince
him, that I was not to blame for the dis∣appointment
he had suffered, and that I should
see him again in a month, when the nuptial knot
should be tied in spite of all opposition.</P>
<P>My lover, who was better acquainted with the
world, had well nigh run distracted with this in∣formation.
He swore he would not leave me,
until I should promise to meet and marry him next
day; or, if I refused to grant that request, he
would immediately leave the kingdom, to which
he would never more return; and before his de∣parture,
sacrifice lord H—B—, son to the duke
of S. A—, who was the only person upon earth
who could have betraved us to my father, be∣cause
he alone was trusted with the secret of our
intended marriage, and had actually undertaken
to give me away; an office which he afterwards
declined. Lord W—m also affirmed, that
my father decoyed me into the country, with a
view of cooping me up, and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equesting me <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tirely
from his view and correspondence.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="80"/>
In vain I pleaded my father's well-known ten∣derness,
and used all the arguments I could re∣collect
to divert him from his revenge upon lord
H—. He was deaf to all my representations,
and nothing, I found, would prevail upon him
to suppress his resentment, but a positive promise
to comply with his former desire. I told him, I
would hazard every thing to make him happy;
but could not, with any regard to my duty, take
such a step, without the knowledge of my pa∣rent;
or, if I were so inclined, it would be im∣practicable
to elude his vigilance and suspicion.
However, he employed such pathetic remon∣strances,
and retained such a powerful advocate
within my own breast, that before we parted, I
assured him, my whole power should be exerted
for his satisfaction; and he signified his resolution
of sitting up all night, in expectation of seeing
me at his lodgings.</P>
<P>He had no sooner retired, than I went into
the next room, and desired my father to fix a
day for the marriage; in which case, I would
cheatfully wait upon him into the country;
whereas, should he deny my request, on pretence
of staying for the consent of my lover's relations,
which was very uncertain, I would seize the first
opportunity of marrying lord W—m, cost
what it would. He consented to the match, but
would not appoint a day for the ceremony, which
he proposed to defer until all parties should be
agreed; and such a favourable crisis, I feared,
would never happen.</P>
<P>I therefore resolved within myself to gratify
my lover's expectation, by eloping, if possible,
that very night; though the execution of this
plan was extremely difficult, because my fa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er
<PB N="76" REF="81"/>
was upon the alarm, and my own maid, who
was my bedfellow, altogether in his interest.
Notwithstanding these considerations, I found
means to engage one of the house-maids in my
behalf, who bespoke an hackney-coach, to be
kept in waiting all night; and to bed I went with
my Abigail, whom (as I had not closed an eye)
I waked about five in the morning, and sent to
pack up some things for our intended journey.</P>
<P>While she was thus employed, I got up, and
huddled on my cloaths, standing upon my pil∣low,
lest my father, who lay in the chamber be∣low,
should hear me afoot, and suspect my de∣sign.</P>
<P>Having dressed myself with great dispatch and
disorder, I flounced down stairs, stalking as hea∣vily
as I could tread, that he might mistake me
for one of the servants; and my confederate open∣ing
the door, I sallied out into the street, though
I knew not which way to turn, and, to my un∣speakable
mortification, neither coach nor chair
appeared.</P>
<P>Having travelled on foot a good way, in hope
of finding a convenience; and being not only dis∣appointed
in that particular, but also bewildered
in my peregrination, I began to be exceedingly
alarmed with the apprehension of being met by
some person who might know me; because, in
that case, my design would undoubtedly have
been discovered, from every circumstance of my
appearance at that time of day; for I had put
on the very cloaths which I had pulled off over
night, so that my dress was altogether odd and
peculiar: my shoes were very fine, and over a
large hoop I wore a pink sattin quilted petticoat
trimmed with silver, which was partly covered
<PB N="77" REF="82"/>
by a white dimity night-gown, a full quarter of
a yard too short: my handkerchief and apron
were hurried on without pinning; my night-cap
could not contain my hair, which hung about
my ears in great disorder, and my countenance
denoted a mixture of hope and fear, joy and
shame.</P>
<P>In this dilemma, I made my addresses to that
honourable member of society a shoe-black, whom
I earnestly intreated to provide me with a coach
or chair, promising to reward him liberally for
his trouble: but he having the misfortune to be
lame, was unable to keep up with my pace; so
that, by his advice and direction, I went into the
first public-house I found open, where I stayed
some time, in the utmost consternation, among
a crew of wretches whom I thought proper to
bribe for their civility, not without the terror of
being stripped. At length, however, my mes∣senger
returned with a chair, of which I took
immediate possession; and fearing that, by this
time, my family would be alarmed, and send di∣rectly
to lord W—m's lodgings, I ordered my∣self
to be carried thither backwards, that so I
might pass undiscovered.</P>
<P>This stratagem succeeded according to my
wish; I ran up stairs, in a state of trepidation,
to my faithful lover, who called an hackney∣coach,
in which we went to church and were
married.</P>
<P>His fears were then all over, but mine recurred
with double aggravation: I dreaded the sight of
my father, and shared all the sorrow he suffered on
account of my undutiful behaviour: for I loved
him with such piety of affection, that I would
have endured every other species of distress, rather
<PB N="78" REF="83"/>
than have given him the least uneasiness: but
love (where he reigns in full empire) is altoge∣ther
irresistible, surmounts every difficulty, and
swallows up all other considerations. This was
the case with me; and now the irrevocable step
was taken, my first care was to avoid his sight.
With this view, I begged that lord W—m
would think of some remote place in the coun∣try,
to which we might retire for the present;
and he forthwith conducted me to an house on
Blackheath, where we were very civilly received
by a laughter-loving dame, who seemed to mi∣stake
me for one of her own sisterhood.</P>
<P>I no sooner perceived her opinion, than I de∣sired
lord W—m to undeceive her; upon
which she was made acquainted with the predica∣ment
in which I stood, and shewed us into a pri∣vate
room, where I called for pen and paper, and
wrote an apology to my father, for having acted
contrary to his will, in so important a concern.</P>
<P>This task being performed, the bridegroom
gave me to understand, that there was a necessity
for our being bedded immediately, in order to
render the marriage binding, lest my father should
discover and part us before consummation. I
pleaded hard for a respite till the evening, ob∣jecting
to the indecency of going to bed before
noon; but he found means to invalidate all my
arguments, and to convince me, that it was now
my duty to obey. Rather than hazard the im∣putation
of being obstinate and refractory on the
first day of my probation, I suffered myself to be
led into a chamber, which was darkened by my
express stipulation, that my shame and confusion
might be the better concealed, and yielded to the
<PB N="79" REF="84"/>
privilege of a dear husband, who loved me to
adoration.</P>
<P>About five o'clock in the afternoon we were
called to dinner, which we had ordered to be
ready at four; but such a paultry care had been
forgot, amidst the transports of our mutual bliss.
We got up, however, and when we came down
stairs, I was ashamed to see the light of day, or
meet the eyes of my beloved lord. I ate little,
said less, was happy, though overwhelmed with
confusion, underwent a thousand agitations, some
of which were painful, but by far the greater
part belonged to rapture and delight; we were
imparadised in the gratification of our mutual
wishes, and felt all that love can bestow, and sen∣sibility
enjoy.</P>
<P>In the twilight, we returned to lord W—m's
lodgings in town, where I received a letter from
my father, importing, that he would never see
me again. But there was one circumstance in his
manner of writing, from which I conceived an
happy presage of his future indulgence. He had
begun with his usual appellation of <HI>Dear Fanny,</HI>
which, though it was expunged to make way for
the word <HI>Madam,</HI> encouraged me to hope that
his paternal fondness was not yet extinguished.</P>
<P>At supper, we were visited by lord W—m's
youngest sister, who laughed at us for our incon∣siderate
match, though, she owned, she envied
our happiness, and offered me the use of her
cloaths, until I could retrieve my own. She
was a woman of a great deal of humour, plain
but genteel, civil, friendly, and perfectly well∣bred.
She favoured us with her company till the
night was pretty far advanced, and did not take
her leave till we retired to our apartment.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="85"/>
As our lodgings were not spacious or magni∣ficent,
we resolved to see little company; but
this resolution was frustrated by the numerous ac∣quaintance
of lord W—m, who let in half the
town; so that I ran the gauntlet for a whole
week among a set of wits, who always delight
in teazing a young creature of any note, when
she happens to make such a stolen match. Among
those that visited us upon this occasion, was my
lord's younger brother, who was at that time in
keeping with a rich heiress of masculine memory,
and took that opportunity of making a parade
with his equipage, which was indeed very mag∣nificent,
but altogether disregarded by us, whose
happiness consisted in the opulence of mutual
love.</P>
<P>This ceremony of receiving visits being per∣formed,
we went to wait on his mother the du∣chess
of H—, who hearing I was an heiress,
readily forgave her son for marrying without her
knowledge and consent, and favoured us with a
very cordial reception; insomuch that, for several
months, we dined almost constantly at her table;
and I must own, I always found her unaltered in
her civility and affection, contrary to her general
character, which was haughty and capricious.
She was undoubtedly a woman of great spirit
and understanding, but subject to an infirmity
which very much impairs and disguises every other
qualification.</P>
<P>In about three weeks after our marriage, I was
so happy as to obtain the forgiveness of my fa∣ther,
to whose house we repaired, in order to pay
our respects and submission. At sight of me he
wept; nor did I behold his tears unmoved: my
heart was over-charged with tenderness and sor∣row,
<PB N="81" REF="86"/>
for having offended such an indulgent pa∣rent;
so that I mingled my tears with his, while
my dear husband, whose soul was of the softest
and gentlest mould, melted with sympathy at the
affecting scene.</P>
<P>Being thus reconciled to my father, we at∣tended
him into the country, where we were re∣ceived
by my mother, who was a sensible good
woman, though not susceptible of love, and there∣fore
less apt to excuse a weakness, to which she
was an utter stranger. This was likewise the
case with an uncle, from whom I had great ex∣pectations.
He was a plain good-natured man,
and treated us with great courtesy; though his
notions, in point of love, were not exactly con∣formable
to ours. Nevertheless, I was, and
seemed to be so happy in my choice, that my fa∣mily
not only became satisfied with the match,
but exceedingly fond of lord W—m.</P>
<P>After a short stay with them in the country,
we returned to London, in order to be introduced
at court, and then set out for the North, on a
visit to my brother-in-law the duke of H—,
who had, by a letter to lord W—m, invited
us to his habitation. My father accordingly
equipped us with horses and money; for our own
finances were extremely slender, consisting only
of a small pension allowed by his grace, upon
whom the brothers were intirely dependent, the
father having died suddenly, before suitable pro∣vision
could be made for his younger children.</P>
<P>When I took my leave of my relations, bid∣ding
adieu to my paternal home, and found my∣self
launching into a world of care and trouble,
though the voyage on which I had embarked was
altogether voluntary, and my companion the per∣son
<PB N="82" REF="87"/>
on whom I doated to distraction, I could not
help feeling some melancholy sensations, which,
however, in a little time, gave way to a train of
more agreeable ideas. I was visited in town by
almost all the women of fashion, many of whom,
I perceived, envied me the possession of a man
who had made strange havock among their hearts,
and some of them knew the value of his favour.
One in particular endeavoured to cultivate my
friendship with singular marks of regard; but I
thought proper to discourage her advances, by
keeping within the bounds of bare civility; and
indeed, to none of them was I lavish of my com∣plaisance;
for I dedicated my whole time to the
object of my affection, who engrossed my wishes
to such a degree, that although I was never jea∣lous
(because I had no reason to be so) I envied
the happiness of every woman whom he chanced
at any time to hand into a coach.</P>
<P>The duchess of—, who was newly
married to the earl of P—, a particular friend
of lord W—m's, carried me to court, and
presented me to the queen, who expressed her ap∣probation
of my person in very particular terms,
and observed the satisfaction that appeared in my
countenance with marks of admiration; desiring
her ladies to take notice, how little happiness de∣pended
upon wealth, since there was more joy
in my face than in all her court beside.</P>
<P>Such a declaration could not fail to overwhelm
me with blushes, which her majesty seemed to
behold with pleasure; for she frequently repeated
the remark, and shewed me to all the foreigners
of distinction, with many gracious expressions of
favour. She wished lord W—m happiness in∣stead
of joy, and was pleased to promise, that she
<PB N="83" REF="88"/>
would provide for her pretty beggars: and poor
enough we certainly were in every article but
love. Nevertheless, we felt no necessities, but
passed the summer in a variety of pleasures and
parties, the greatest part of which were planned
by lord W—m's sister and another lady, who
was at that time mistress to the prime minister.
The first was a wit, but homely in her person;
the other, a woman of great beauty and mascu∣line
understanding; and a particular friendship
subsisted between them, though they were both
lovers of power and admiration.</P>
<P>This lady, who sat at the helm, was ex∣tremely
elegant as well as expensive in her diver∣sions,
in many of which we bore a share; parti∣cularly
in her parties upon the water, which
were contrived in all the magnificence of taste.
In the course of these amusements, a trifling cir∣cumstance
occurred, which I shall relate as an
instance of that jealous sensibility which charac∣terised
lord W—'s disposition. A large com∣pany
of ladies and gentlemen having agreed to
dine at Vauxhall, and sup at Marblehall, where
we proposed to conclude the evening with a
dance, one barge being insufficient to contain the
whole company, we were divided by lots; in
consequence of which, my husband and I were
parted. This separation was equally mortifying
to us both, who, though married, were still lo∣vers;
and my chagrin was increased, when I
perceived that I was doomed to sit by Sir W—
Y—, a man of professed gallantry: for, al∣though
lord W—m had, before his marriage,
made his addresses to every woman he saw, I
knew very well he did not desire that any per∣son
should make love to his wife.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="89"/>
That I might not therefore give umbrage,
by talking to this gallant, I conversed with a
Scotch nobleman, who, according to common
report, had formerly sighed among my ad∣mirers:
by these means, in seeking to avoid one
error, I unwittingly plunged myself into a
greater; and disobliged Lord W—m so much,
that he could not conceal his displeasure; nay,
so deeply was he offended at my conduct, that
in the evening, when the ball began, he would
scarce deign to take me by the hand in the course
of dancing, and darted such unkind looks as
pierced me to the very soul; and what augment∣ed
my concern, was my ignorance of the trespass
I had committed. I was tortured with a thou∣sand
uneasy reflections; I began to fear that I
had mistaken his temper, and given my heart to
a man who was tired of possession; tho' I re∣solved
to bear without complaining the misfor∣tune
I had entailed upon myself.</P>
<P>I seized the first opportunity of speaking to
him, and thereby discovered the cause of his
chagrin; but, as there was no time for expostu∣lation,
the misunderstanding continued on his
side, with such evident marks of uneasiness, that
every individual of the company made up to
me, and inquired about the cause of his disorder;
so that I was fain to amuse their concern, by
saying that he had been ill the day before, and
dancing did not agree with his constitution. So
much was he incensed by this unhappy circum∣stance
of my conduct, which was void of all in∣tention
to offend him, that he determined to be
revenged of me, for my indiscretion, and at sup∣per,
chancing to sit between two very handsome
ladies, (one of whom is lately dead, and the o∣ther,
<PB N="85" REF="90"/>
at present, my neighbour in the country)
he affected an air of gaiety, and openly coquetted
with them both.</P>
<P>This was not the only punishment he inflicted
on his innocent wife. In the course of our en∣tertainment,
we engaged in some simple diver∣sion,
in consequence of which, the gentlemen
were ordered to salute the ladies; when Lord
W—m, in performing this command, unkind∣ly
neglected me in my turn; and I had occasion
for all my discretion and pride, to conceal from
the company the agonies I felt at this mark of
indifference and disrespect. However, I obtained
the victory over myself, and pretended to laugh
at his husband-like behaviour, while the tears
stood in my eyes, and my heart swelled even to
bursting.</P>
<P>We broke up about five, after having spent
the most tedious evening I had ever known; and
this offended lover went to bed in a state of sullen
silence and disgust. Whatever desire I had to
come to an explanation, I thought myself so
much aggrieved by his unreasonable prejudice,
that I could not prevail upon myself to demand a
conterence, till after his first nap, when my pride
giving way to my tenderness, I clasped him in
my arms, though he pretended to discourage
these advances of my love: I asked how he could
be so unjust as to take umbrage at my civility to
a man whom, he knew, I had refused for his
sake. I chid him for his barbarous endeavours
to awake my jealousy, and used such irre∣sistible
arguments in my own vindication, that
he was convinced of my innocence, sealed my
acqu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttal with a kind embrace, and we mutually
<PB N="86" REF="91"/>
enjoyed the soft transports of a fond reconci∣liation.</P>
<P>Never was passion more eager, delicate, or
unreserved, than that which glowed within our
breasts. Far from being cloyed with the posses∣sion
of each other, our raptures seemed to in∣crease
with the term of our union. When we
were parted, though but for a few hours, by the
necessary avocations of life, we were unhappy
during that brief separation, and met again, like
lovers who knew no joy but in one another's
presence. How many delicious evenings did we
spend together, in our own little apartment, after
we had ordered the candles to be taken away,
that we might enjoy the agreeable reflection of the
moon, in a fine summer's evening. Such a mil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
and solemn scene naturally disposes the mind to
peace and benevolence; but when improved with
the conversation of the man one loves, it fills the
imagination with ideas of ineffable delight! For
my own part, I can safely say, my heart was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
wholly ingrossed by my husband, that I never
took pleasure in any diversion, where he was
not personally concerned; nor was I ever guilty
of one thought repugnant to my duty and my
love.</P>
<P>In the autumn we set out for the north, and
were met on the road by the duke and twenty
gentlemen, who conducted us to H—n, where
we lived in all imaginable splendor. His grace, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that time, maintained above an hundred servants
with a band of music, which always performes
at dinner, kept open table, and was visited by a
great deal of company. The oeconomy of his
house was superintended by his eldest sister, a
beautiful young lady of an amiable temper, with
<PB N="87" REF="92"/>
whom I soon contracted an intimate friendship▪
She and the duke used to rally me upon my sond∣ness
for lord W—m, who was a sort of an
humourist, and apt to be in a pet, in which case
he would leave the company, and go to bed by
seven o'clock in the evening. On these occasions
I always disappeared, giving up every considera∣tion
to that of pleasing my husband, notwithstand∣ing
the ridicule of his relations, who taxed me
with having spoiled him with too much indul∣gence.
But how could I express too much
tenderness and condescension for a man, who
doated upon me to such excess, that when busi∣ness
obliged him to leave me, he always snatched
the first opportunity to return, and often rode
through darkness, storms and tempests to my
arms.</P>
<P>Having stayed about seven months in this
place, I found myself in a fair way of being a
mother; and that I might be near my own re∣lations,
in such an interesting situation, I and my
dear companion departed from H—n, not with∣out
great reluctance; for I was fond of the Scots
in general, who treated me with great hospitality
and respect; and to this day, they pay me the
compliment of saying, I was one of the best
wives in that country, which is so justly cele∣brated
for good women.</P>
<P>Lord W—m having attended me to my fa∣ther's
house, was obliged to return to Scotland,
to support his interest in being elected member
of parliament; so that he took his leave of me,
with a full resolution of seeing me again, before
the time of my lying-inn; and all the comfort I
enjoyed in his absence, was the perusal of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which I punctually received, together
<PB N="88" REF="93"/>
with those of his sister, who, from time to time,
favoured me with assurances of his constancy and
devotion. Indeed these testimonials were neces∣sary
to one of my disposition; for I was none of
those who could be contented with half an heart.
I could not even spare one complacent look to any
other woman, but expected the undivided homage
of his love. Had I been disappointed in this ex∣pectation,
I should (though a wife) have re∣belled
or died.</P>
<P>Mean while, my parents treated me with great
tenderness, intending that lord W—m should
be settled in a house of his own, and accommo∣dated
with my fortune; and his expectations from
the queen were very sanguine, when I was ta∣ken
ill, and delivered of a dead child: an event
which affected me so much, that when I under∣stood
the extent of my misfortune, my heart
throbbed with such violence, that my breast
could scarce contain it; and my anxiety being ag∣gravated
by the absence of my lord, produced a
dangerous fever, of which he was no sooner ap∣prized
by letter, than he came post from Scot∣land;
but before his arrival, I was supposed to be
in a fair way.</P>
<P>During this journey, he was tortured with
all that terrible suspence which prevails in the
minds of those who are in danger of losing that
which is most dear to them; and when he en∣tered
the house, was so much overwhelmed with
apprehension, that he durst not inquire about the
state of my health.</P>
<P>As for my part, I never closed an eye from
the time on which I expected his return; and
when I heard his voice, threw open my curtains,
and sat up in the bed to receive him, though at
<PB N="89" REF="94"/>
the hazard of my life. He ran towards me with
all the eagerness of passion, and clasp'd me in his
arms; he kneeled by my bed-side, kissed my hand
a thousand times, and wept with transports of
tenderness and joy. In short, this meeting was
so pathetic, as to overcome my enfeebled consti∣tution;
and we were parted by those who were
wiser than ourselves, and saw that nothing was
so proper for us as a little repose.</P>
<P>But how shall I relate the deplorable transition
from envied happiness to excess of misery, which I
now sustained! My month was hardly up, when my
dear husband was taken ill: perhaps the fatigue of
body as well as mind, which he had undergone on
my account, occasioned a fatal ferment in his blood,
and his health fell a sacrifice to his love. Physi∣cians
were called from London; but alas! they
brought no hopes of his recovery. By their ad∣vice,
he was removed to town, for the con∣venience
of being punctually attended. Every
moment was too precious to be thrown away;
he was therefore immediately put into the coach,
though the day was far spent; and I, though ex∣ceedingly
weak, accompanied him in the journey,
which was performed by the light of flambeaus,
and rendered unspeakably shocking, by the dismal
apprehension of losing him every moment.</P>
<P>At length, however, we arrived at our lodgings
in Pall-mall, where I lay by him on the floor,
and attended the issue of his distemper, in all the
agonies of horror and despair. In a little time
his malady settled upon his brain, and in his deli∣rium,
he uttered such dreadful exclamations, as
were sufficient to pierce the most savage heart.
What effect then must they have had on mine,
which was fraught with every sentiment of the
<PB N="90" REF="95"/>
most melting affection! It was not a common
grief that took possession of my soul; I felt all
the aggravation of the most acute distress. I
sometimes ran down to the street in a fit of di∣straction:
I sent for the doctors every minute:
I wearied heaven with my prayers; even now
my heart akes at the remembrance of what I suf∣fered,
and I cannot without trembling proceed
with the woeful story.</P>
<P>After having lain insensible some days, he re∣covered
the use of speech, and called upon my
name, which he had a thousand times repeated,
while he was bereft of reason. All hopes of has
life were now relinquished, and I was led to
bed-side to receive his last adieu, being direct<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
to summon all my fortitude, and suppress my sor∣row,
that he might not be disturbed by my agi∣tation.
I collected all my resolution to support
the in this affecting scene: I saw my dear lord <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
extremity; the beauties of his youth were all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
cayed, yet his eyes, though languid, retained un∣speakable
sweetness and expression. He felt his
end approaching, put forth his hand, and within
look full of complacency and benevolence, ut∣tered
such a tender tale—Good heaven! how
had I deserved such accumulated affliction! the
bare remembrance of which now melts me in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tears.
Human nature could not undergo my s∣tuation,
without suffering an extasy of grief! <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
clasped him in my arms, and kissed him a thou∣sand
times, with the most violent emotions <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
woe: but I was torn from his embrace, and in
little time he was ravished for ever from m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
view.</P>
<P>On that fatal morning, which put a period <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
has life, I saw the duchess of L—approach <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="91" REF="96"/>
bed, and, from her appearance, concluded that
he was no more; yet I begg'd she would not
confirm the unhappy presage, by announcing his
death; and she accordingly preserved the most
emphatic silence. I got up, and trod softly over
his head, as if I had been afraid of interrupting
his repose. Alas! he was no longer sensible of
such disturbance. I was seized with a stupifica∣tion
of sorrow: I threw up the window, and
looking around, thought the sun shone with the
most dismal aspect; every thing was solitary,
chearless, and replete with horror.</P>
<P>In this condition I was, by the direction of
my friend, conveyed to her house, where my fa∣culties
were so overpowered by the load of an∣guish
which oppressed me, that I know not what
passed during the first days of my unhappy wi∣dowhood:
this only I know, the kind duchess
treated me with all imaginable care and compas∣sion,
and carried me to her country-house,
where I stayed some months; during which, she
endeavoured to comfort me with all the amuse∣ments
she could invent, and laid me under such
obligations, as shall never be erased from my re∣membrance:
yet, notwithstanding all her care
and concern, I was, by my excess of grief,
plunged into a languishing distemper, for which
my physicians advised me to drink the Bath
waters.</P>
<P>In compliance with this prescription, I went
thither towards the end of summer, and found
some benefit by adhering to their directions;
though I seldom went abroad, except when I vi∣sited
my sister-in-law, who was there with the
princess; and upon these occasions, I never failed
to attract the notice of the company, who were
<PB N="92" REF="97"/>
struck with the appearance of such a young crea∣ture
in weeds. Nor was I free from the persecu∣tion
of professed admirers; but being dead to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
joy, I was deaf to the voice of adulation.</P>
<P>About Christmas, I repaired to my father's
house, where my sorrows were revived by every
object that recalled the idea of my dear lamented
lord. But these melancholy reflections I was ob∣liged
to bear, because I had no other home or ha∣bitation,
being lest an unprovided widow, altoge∣ther
dependant on the affection of my own family.</P>
<P>During this winter, divers overtures were made
to my father, by people who demanded me in
marriage; but my heart was not yet sufficiently
weaned from my former passion, to admit the
thoughts of another master. Among those the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
presented their proposals, was a certain young
nobleman, who upon the first news of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
W—m's death, came post from Paris, in or∣der
to declare his passion. He made his first ap∣pearance
in a hired chariot and six, accompanies
by a big fat fellow, whom (as I afterwards
learn'd) he had engaged to sound his praises, with
the promise of a thousand pounds, in lieu <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
which he paid him with forty. Whether it was
with a view of screening himself from the col<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
or of making a comfortable medium in case of
being overturned, and falling under his weight<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
companion, I know not; but certain it is, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
carriage was stuffed with hay, in such a manner
that when he arrived, the servants were at some
pains in rummaging and removing it, before they
could come at their master, or help him to alight
When he was lifted out of the chariot, he ex∣hibited
a very ludicrous figure to the view: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
was a thin, meagre, shivering creature, of a lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="93" REF="98"/>
stature, with little black eyes, a long nose, sal∣low
complexion, and pitted with the small pox,
dressed in a coat of light brown frize, lined with
pink-coloured shag, a monstrous solitaire and
bag, and (if I remember aright) a pair of huge
jack-boots. In a word, his whole appearance
was so little calculated for inspiring love, that I
had (on the strength of seeing him once before
at Oxford) set him down as the last man on
earth, whom I would chuse to wed; and I will
venture to affirm, that he was, in every parti∣cular,
the very reverse of my late husband.</P>
<P>As my father was not at home, he stayed but
one evening, and left his errand with my mother,
to whom he was as disagreeable as to myself; so
that his proposal was absolutely rejected; and
I heard no more of him during the space of
three whole months, at the expiration of which,
I went to town, where this mortifying figure
presented itself again, and renewed his suit, of∣fering
such advantageous terms of settlement,
that my father began to relish the match, and
warmly recommended it to my consideration.</P>
<P>Lord W—m's relations advised me to embrace
the opportunity of making myself independent;
all my acquaintance plied me with with argu∣ments
to the same purpose: I was uneasy at
home, and indifferent to all mankind. I weighed
the motives with the objections, and with reluc∣tance
yielded to the importunity of my friends.</P>
<P>In consequence of this determination, the little
gentleman was permitted to visit me; and the
manner of his address did not at all alter the
opinion I had conceived of his character and un∣derstanding.
I was even shocked at the prospect
of marrying a man whom I could not love; and,
<PB N="94" REF="99"/>
in order to disburthen my own conscience, took
an opportunity of telling him one evening, as
we sat opposite to each other, that it was not in
my power to command my affection, and there∣fore
he could not expect the possession of my
heart, lord W—m's indulgence having spoiled
me for a wife. Nevertheless, I would endeavour
to contract a friendship for him, which would in∣tirely
depend upon his own behaviour.</P>
<P>To this declaration he replied (to my great
surprize) that he did not desire me to love him,
my friendship was sufficient; and next day,
repeated this strange instance of moderation in a
letter, which I communicated to my sister, who
laughed heartily at the contents, and persuaded
me, that since I could love no man, he was the
properest person to be my husband.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the wedding cloaths and equipage
being prepared, the day—<HI>the fatal day was fixed!</HI>
on the morning of which, I went to the house of
my brother-in-law duke H—, who loved me
tenderly, and took my leave of the family; a
family which I shall always remember with love,
honour, and esteem. His grace received me in
the most affectionate manner, saying at parting,
“Lady W—m, if he does not use you well,
I will take you back again.”</P>
<P>The bridegroom and I met at Ox—chapel,
where the ceremony was performed by the bishop
of W—, in presence of his mother, my fa∣ther,
and another lady; and the nuptial knot
being tied, we set out for my father's house in
the country, and proceeded full twenty miles on
car journey, before my lord opened his mouth;
my though<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s having been all that time employed
on something quite foreign to my present situa∣tion;
<PB N="95" REF="100"/>
for I was then but a giddy girl of eighteen.
At length my father broke silence, and clapping
his lordship on the shoulder, told him he was but
a dull bridegroom; upon which, my lord gave
him to understand, that he was out of spirits.
This dejection continued all the day, notwith∣standing
the refreshment of a plentiful dinner,
which he ate upon the road; and in the evening we
arrived at the place of destination, where we were
kindly received by my mother, though she had
no liking to the match; and after supper, we re∣tired
to our apartment.</P>
<P>It was here that I had occasion to perceive the
most disagreeable contrast between my present
help-mate and my former lord: instead of flying to
my arms with all the eagerness of love and rap∣ture,
this manly representative sat moping in a
corner, like a criminal on execution-day, and
owned he was ashamed to bed a woman, whose
hand he had scarce ever touched.</P>
<P>I could not help being affected with this pusilani∣mous
behaviour: I remembered lord W—m,
while I surveyed the object before me, and made
such a comparison as filled me with horror and
disgust: nay, to such a degree did my aversion
to this phantom prevail, that I began to sweat
with anguish at the thought of being subjected to
his pleasure: and when, after a long hesitation,
he vertured to approach me, I trembled as if I
had been exposed to the embraces of a rattle∣snake.
Nor did the efforts of his love diminish
this antipathy; his attempts were like the pawings
of an imp, sent from hell to teize and torment
some guilty wretch, such as are exhibited in
some dramatic performance, which I never see
acted, without remembering my wedding-night.
<PB N="96" REF="101"/>
By such shadowy, unsubstantial, vexatious beha∣viour,
was I tantalized, and robb'd of my re∣pose;
and early next morning I got up, with a
most sovereign contempt for my bedfellow, who
indulged himself in bed till eleven.</P>
<P>Having passed a few days in this place, I went
home with him to his house at Twickenham;
and soon after we were presented at court, when
the queen was pleased to say to my lord's mo∣ther,
she did not doubt that we should be an hap∣py
couple, for I had been a good wife to my for∣mer
husband.</P>
<P>Whatever deficiencies I had to complain of in
my new spouse, he was not wanting in point of
liberality: I was presented with a very fine cha∣riot
studded with silver nails, and such a profu∣sion
of jewels as furnished a joke to some of my
acquaintance, who observed that I was formerly
queen of hearts, but now metamorphosed into
the queen of diamonds. This uncommon splen∣dour
attracted the eyes and envy of my competi∣tors,
who were the more implacable in their re∣sentments,
because, notwithstanding my mar∣riage,
I was as much as ever followed by the men
of gallantry and pleasure, among whom it is a
constant maxim, that a woman never with-holds
her affections from her husband, without an in∣tention
to bestow them somewhere else. I never
appeared without a train of admirers, and my
house in the country was always crouded with
gay young men of quality.</P>
<P>Among those who cultivated my good graces
with the greatest skill and assiduity, were the earl
C—, and Mr. S—, brother to lord F—.
The former of whom, in the course of his ad∣dresses,
treated me with an entertainment of sur∣prising
<PB N="97" REF="102"/>
magnificence, disposed into a dinner, sup∣per,
and ball; to which I, at his desire, invited
eleven ladies, whom he paired with the like num∣ber
of his own sex: so that the whole company
amounted to twenty-four. We were regaled
with a most elegant dinner, in an apartment
which was altogether superb, and served by
gentlemen only, no livery-servant being permit∣ed
to come within the door. In the afternoon
we embarked in two splendid barges, being at∣tended
by a band of musick, in a third; and en∣joyed
a delightful evening upon the river, till the
twilight, when we returned, and began the ball,
which was conducted with such order and taste,
that mirth and good humour prevailed, and no
dissatissaction appeared, except in the countenance
of one old maid, since married to a son of the
duke of—, who, tho' she would not refuse to
partake of such an agreeable entertainment, was
displeased that I should have the honour of invit∣ing
her. O baleful Envy! thou self-tormenting
fiend! How do'st thou predominate in all assem∣blies,
from the grand gala of a court to the meet∣ing
of simple peasants at their harvest-home! Nor
is the prevalence of this sordid passion to be won∣dered
at, if we consider the weakness, pride, and
vanity of our sex. The presence of one favourite
man shall poison the enjoyment of a whole com∣pany,
and produce the most rancorous enmity
betwixt the closest friends.</P>
<P>I danced with the master of the ball, who em∣ployed
all the artillery of his eloquence in making
love; yet I did not listen to his addresses, for he
was not to my taste, tho' he possessed an agree∣able
person, and a good acquired understanding;
but he was utterly ignorant of that gentle prevail∣ing
<PB N="98" REF="103"/>
art which I afterwards experienced in Mr.
S—, and which was the only method he could
have successfully practised, in seducing a young
woman like me, born with sentiments of ho∣nour,
and trained up in the paths of religion and
virtue. He was, indeed, absolutely master of
those insinuating qualifications which few wo∣men
of passion and sensibility can resist; and had
a person every way adapted for profiting by these
insidious talents. He was well acquainted with
the human heart, conscious of his own power and
capacity, and exercised these endowments with
unwearied perseverance. He was tall and thin,
which was perfectly agreeable to my taste, with
large blue eloquent eyes, good teeth, and a long
head turned to gallantry. His behaviour was the
standard of politeness, and all his advances were
conducted with the most profound respect; which
is the most effectual expedient a man can use
against us, if he can find means to persuade us,
that it proceeds from the excess and delicacy of
his passion. It is no other than a silent compli∣ment,
by which our accomplishments are con∣tinually
slattered, and pleases in proportion to the
supposed understanding of him who pays it.</P>
<P>By these arts and advantages this consummate
politician in love began by degrees to sap the
foundations of my conjugal faith; he stole imper∣ceptibly
into my affection, and, by dint of oppor∣tunity,
which he well knew how to improve,
triumphed, at last, over all his rivals.</P>
<P>Nor was he the only person that disputed
my heart with Earl C—, who was also rivaled
by lord C—H—, a Scotchman, who had been
an intimate and relation of my former husband.
This gentleman I would have preferred to most
<PB N="99" REF="104"/>
of his competitors, and I coqueted with him for
some time: but this amour was interrupted by
his going to Ireland; upon which occasion, under∣standing
that he was but indifferently provided
with money, I made him a present of a gold
snuff-box, in which was inclosed a bank-note; a
trifling mark of my esteem, which he afterwards
justified by the most grateful, friendly, and gen∣teel,
behaviour; and as we corresponded by let∣ters,
I frankly told him, that Mr. S—had stept
in, and won the palm from all the rest of my ad∣mirers.</P>
<P>This new favourite's mothers and sisters, who
lived in the neighbourhood, were my constant
companions; and, in consequence of this inti∣macy,
he never let a day pass without paying his
respects to me in person; nay, so ingenious was
he in contriving the means of promoting his suit,
that whether I rode or walked, went abroad or
stayed at home, he was always of course one of the
party: so that his design seemed to ingross his whole
vigilance and attention. Thus he studied my dis∣position,
and established himself in my good opi∣nion,
at the same time. He found my heart
was susceptible of every tender impression, and
saw that I was not free from the vanity of youth;
he had already acquired my friendship and esteem,
from which he knew there was a short and easy
transition to love; and by his penetration choosing
proper seasons for the theme, urged it with such
pathetic vows and artful adulation, as well
might captivate a young woman of my complexion
and inexperience, and circumstanced as I was,
with a husband whom I had such reason to de∣spise.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="105"/>
Tho' he thus made an insensible progress in
my heart, he did not find my virtue an easy con∣quest;
and I myself was ignorant of the advantage
he had gained, with regard to my inclinations,
until I was convinced of his success by an alarm
of jealousy which I one day felt, at seeing him
engaged in conversation with another lady. I
forthwith recognized this symptom of love, with
which I had been formerly acquainted, and
trembled at the discovery of my own weakness,
I underwent a strange agitation and mixture of
contrary sensations: I was pleased with the pas∣sion,
yet ashamed of avowing it even to my own
mind. The rights of a husband (tho' mine was
but a nominal one) occurred to my reflexion,
and virtue, modesty and honour forbad me to
cherish the guilty flame.</P>
<P>While I encouraged these laudable scruples,
and resolved to sacrifice my love to duty and re∣putation,
my lord was almost every day employ∣ed
in riding post to my father, with complaints of
my conduct, which was hitherto irreproachable;
tho' the greatest grievance which he pretended to
have suffered, was my refusing to comply with
his desire, when he intreated me to lie a whole
hour every morning, with my neck uncovered,
that by gazing he might quiet the perturbation of
his spirits. From this request you may judge of
the man, as well as of the regard I must enter∣tain
for his character and disposition.</P>
<P>During the whole summer I was besieged by
my artful undoer, and in the autumn set out
with my lord for Bath, where, by reason of the
intimacy that subsisted between our families, we
lived in the same house with my lover and his
sister, who, with another agreeable young lady,
<PB N="101" REF="106"/>
accompanied us in this expedition. By this time
Mr. S—had extorted from me a confession of a
mutual flame, tho' I assured him that it should
never induce me to give up the valuable posses∣sions
of an unspotted character, and a conscience
void of offence. I offered him all the enjoy∣ment
he could reap from an unreserved inter∣course
of souls, abstracted from any sensual con∣sideration;
and he eagerly embraced the Plato∣nic
proposal, because he had sagacity enough to
foresee the issue of such chimerical contracts, and
knew me too well to think he could accomplish
his purpose without seeming to acquiesce in my
own terms, and cultivating my tenderness under
the specious pretext.</P>
<P>In consequence of this agreement we took all
opportunities of seeing each other in private; and
these interviews were spent in mutual protesta∣tions
of disinterested love. This correspondence,
tho' dangerous, was (on my side) equally inno∣cent
and endearing; and many happy hours we
pass'd, before my sentiments were discovered.
At length my lover was taken ill, and then my
passion burst out beyond the power of conceal∣ment;
my grief and anxiety became so conspi∣caous
in my countenance, and my behaviour was
so indiscreet, that every body in the house per∣ceived
the situation of my thoughts, and blamed
my conduct accordingly.</P>
<P>Certain it is I was extremely imprudent, tho'
intentionally innocent. I have lain whole nights
by my lord, who teized and tormented me for
that which neither I could give nor he could take,
and ruminated on the fatal consequence of this
unhappy flame, until I was worked into a fever
of disquiet. I saw there was no safety but in
<PB N="102" REF="107"/>
flight, and often determined to banish myself for
ever from the sight of this dangerous intruder.
But my resolution always failed at the approach
of day, and my desire of seeing him as constant∣ly
recurred. So far was I from persisting in such
commendable determinations, that, on the eve of
our departure from Bath, I felt the keenest pangs
of sorrow at our approaching separation; and as
we could not enjoy our private interviews at my
house in town, I promised to visit him at his own
apartments, after he had sworn by all that's sa∣cred,
that he would take no sinister advantage of
my condescension, by presuming upon the op∣portunities
I should give.</P>
<P>He kept his word; for he saw I trusted to it
with fear and trembling, and perceived that my
apprehension was not affected, but the natural
concern of a young creature, distracted between
love and duty, whom, had he alarmed, he never
would have seen within his doors again. Instead
of pressing me with sollicitations in favour of his
passion, he was more than ever respectful and
complaisant; so that I found myself disengaged
of all restraint, conducted the conversation,
shortened and repeated my visits, at my own
pleasure, till, at last, I became so accustomed to
this communication, that his house was as fami∣liar
to me as my own.</P>
<P>Having in this manner secured himself in my
confidence, he resumed the favourite topic of
love, and warming my imagination by gradual
advances on the subject, my heart began to pant;
and when he saw me thus, he snatched the favou∣rable
occasion to practise all his eloquence and
art. I could not resist his energy, nor even fly
from the temptation that assailed me, until he
<PB N="103" REF="108"/>
had obtained a promise that he should, at our
next meeting, reap the fruits of his tedious ex∣pectation.
Upon this condition I was permitted
to retire, and blessed heaven for my escape,
fully determined to continue in the path of virtue
I had hitherto trod, and stifle the criminal flame,
by which my peace and reputation were endan∣gered.
But his idea, which reigned within my
heart, without controul, soon bassied all those
prudent suggestions.</P>
<P>I saw him again; and he reminded me of my
promise, which I endeavoured to evade with affect∣ed
pleasantry; upon which he manifested the ut∣most
displeasure and chagrin, shedding some cro∣codile
tears, and upbraiding me with levity and
indifference. He observed, that he had sollicited
my favour for ten long months, without inter∣mission,
and imagined I had held out so long
on virtuous motives only; but now he could
plainly perceive that his want of success had been
owing to my want of affection; and that all my
professions were insincere: in a word, he per∣suaded
me, that his remonstrances were just and
reasonable. I could not see the affliction of a man
I loved, when I knew it was in my power to re∣move
it; and rather than forfeit his opinion of
my sincerity and love, I consented to his wish.
My heart now flutters at the remembrance of the
dear, tho' fatal indiscretion; yet I reflect with∣out
remorse, and even remember it with plea∣sure.</P>
<P>If I could not avoid the censure of the world,
I was resolved to bear it without repining; and
sure the guilt (if there was any in my conduct)
was but venial; for I considered myself as a per∣son
absolved of all matrimonial ties, by the in∣significance
<PB N="104" REF="109"/>
of lord—, who, tho' a nominal
husband, was, in fact, a mere non entity. I
therefore contracted a new engagement with my
lover, to which I resolved to adhere with the
most scrupulous fidelity, without the least inten∣tion
of injuring my lord or his relations; for had
our mutual passion produced any visible effects, I
would immediately have renounced and aban∣doned
my husband for ever, that the fruit of my
love for Mr. S—might not have inherited, to
the detriment of the right heir. This was my
determination, which I thought just, if not pru∣dent;
and for which I have incurred the imputa∣tion
of folly, in the opinion of this wise and ho∣nest
generation, by whose example and advice I
have, since that time, been a little reformed in
point of prudentials, tho' I still retain a strong
tendency to return to my primitive way of think∣ing.</P>
<P>When I quitted Mr. S—, after the sacrifice
I had made, and returned to my own bed, it
may perhaps be supposed that I slept but little.
True: I was kept awake by the joyful impa∣tience
of revisiting my lover. Indeed I neglect∣ed
no opportunity of flying to his arms: when
lord—was in the country we enjoyed each
other's company without interruption, but when
he resided in town our correspondence was li∣mited
to stolen interviews, which were unspeak∣ably
delicious, as genuine love presided at the en∣tertainment.</P>
<P>Such was my happiness, in the course of this
tender communication, that to this day I remem∣ber
it with pleasure, tho' it has cost me dear in
the sequel, and was at that time enjoyed at a
considerable expence; for I devoted myself so in∣tirely
<PB N="105" REF="110"/>
to my lover, who was desirous of en∣grossing
my time and thoughts, that my ac∣quaintance,
which was very numerous, justly ac∣cused
me of neglect, and of consequence cooled
in their friendships: but I was <HI>all for love, or the
world well lost.</HI> And were the same opportunity
to offer, I would act the same conduct over
again.</P>
<P>Some there are who possibly may wonder how
I could love twice with such violence of affection:
but all such observers must be unacquainted with
the human heart. Mine was naturally adapted
for the tender passions, and had been so fortunate,
so cherished, in its first impressions, that it felt
with joy the same sensations revive, when in∣fluenced
by the same engaging qualifications.
Certain it is I loved the second time as well as the
first, and better was impossible. I gave up my
all for both: fortune and my father's favour for
the one; reputation, friends, and fortune for the
other. Yet, notwithstanding this intimate con∣nexion,
I did not relinquish the world all at
once; on the contrary I still appeared at court,
and attracted the notice and approbation of my
royal patroness; I danced with the p—of W—;
a circumstance which so nearly affected Mr. S—,
who was present, that, in order to manifest his
resentment, he chose the ugliest woman in the
ball for his partner; and I no sooner perceived his
uneasiness than I gave over, with a view of ap∣peasing
his displeasure.</P>
<P>Without repeating particular circumstances,
let it suffice to say, our mutual passion was a
perfect copy of that which had subsisted between
me and dear lord W—m. It was jealous,
melting and delicate, and checquered with little
<PB N="106" REF="111"/>
accidents, which serve to animate and maintain
the flame, in its first ardency of rapture. When
my lover was sick, I attended and nursed him
with indefatigable tenderness and care; and dur∣ing
an indisposition which I caught in the per∣formance
of this agreeable office, he discharged
the obligation with all the warmth of sympathy
and love.</P>
<P>It was, however, judged necessary by the
physicians, that I should use the Bath-waters for
the recovery of my health; and I set out for that
place, glad of a pretence to be absent from lord
—, with whom I lived on very unhappy terms.
He had, about nine months after our marriage,
desired that we might sleep in separate beds, and
gave a very whimsical reason for this proposal.
He said, the immensity of his love deprived him
of the power of gratification, and that some
commerce with an object, to which his heart was
not attached, might, by diminishing the transports
of his spirits, recompose his nerves, and enable
him to enjoy the fruits of his good fortune.</P>
<P>You may be sure I made no objections to this
plan, which was immediately put in execution.
He made his addresses to a nymph of Drury-lane,
whose name (as he told me) was Mrs. Rock.
She made shift to extract some money from her
patient; but his infirmity was beyond the power
of her art; though she made some mischief be∣tween
us; and I communicated my suspicion to
duke H—, who intended to have expostu∣lated
with her upon the subject; but she got inti∣mation
of his design, and saved him the trouble,
by a precipitate retreat.</P>
<P>After my return from the Bath, where Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and I had lived happily, until we were interrupted
<PB N="107" REF="112"/>
by the arrival of my husband, his lordship ex∣pressed
an inclination to be my bedfellow again;
but in this particular I desired to be excused: for
though I would not be the first to propose the se∣paration,
which, though usual in other countries,
is contrary to the custom of England, being un∣willing
to furnish the least handle for censure,
as my character was still unblemished; yet, when
the proposal came from himself, I thought myself
intitled to refuse a re-union, to which I accord∣ingly
objected.</P>
<P>This opposition produced a quarrel, which rose
to a state of perpetual animosity; so that we be∣gan
to talk of parting. My lord relished the ex∣pedient,
agreeing to add three hundred pounds a
year to my pin-money, which (by the bye) was
never paid; and I renounced all state and gran∣deur,
to live in a small house that I hired at Case∣horton,
where I passed my time for two months,
in the most agreeable retirement, with my dear
lover, till I was disturbed by the intrusion of my
lord, who molested me with visits and solicita∣tions
to return, pretending that he had changed
his mind, and insisting upon my compliance with
his desire.</P>
<P>I exhausted my invention in endeavours to
evade his request; but he persecuted me without
ceasing: so that I was fain to capitulate, on con∣dition
that we should immediately set out for
France; and that he should not presume to ap∣proach
my bed, till our arrival at Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is. We ac∣cordingly
departed for that kingdom; and, far
from infringing the last article of our treaty, his
lordship did not insist upon his privilege, before
we reached the capital of France.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="113"/>
Mean while, I began to feel the effect of my
passion in a very interesting manner, and com∣municated
my discovery to the dear author of it,
who would not leave me in such an affecting si∣tuation,
but took the first opportunity of follow∣ing
us to France.</P>
<P>In our road to Paris, we stopp'd to visit Chan∣tilly,
a magnificent Chateau belonging to the
prince of Condé, and there met by accident with
some English noblemen, to whom I was known.
The prince and his sisters invited me very politely
into the gallery where they sat. They comple∣mented
me on my person, and seemed to admire
my dress, which was altogether new to them,
being a blue English riding-habit trimmed with
gold, and an hat with a feather. They were
particularly well pleased with my hair, which
hung down to my waist, and pressed me to stay
a fortnight at their house; an invitation which I
was very much mortified at being obliged to re∣fuse,
because my lord did not understand the
French language. I was inchanted with the
place and the company, the women being amiable
and the men polite; nor were they strangers to
my name and story; for Mr. S—calling at
the same place a few days after, they rallied him
on my account.</P>
<P>When we arrived at Paris, the first thing I
did was to metamorphose myself into a French
woman. I cut off my hair, hid a very good
complexion of my own with <HI>Rouge,</HI> reconcile<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
myself to powder, which I had never used before,
put on a robe with a large hoop, and went to
the <HI>Thuilleries,</HI> full of spirits and joy; for at that
time every thing conspired to make me happy: <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
had health, youth and beauty, love, vanity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="109" REF="114"/>
affluence, and found myself surrounded with di∣versions,
which were gay, new and agreeable.
My appearance drew upon me the eyes of the
whole company, who considered me as a stranger,
but not a foreigner, so compleatly was I equipped
in the fashion of the French; and when they un∣derstood
who I was, they applauded my person
with the most lavish encomiums, according to
their known politeness.</P>
<P>After having made a circuit round all the pub∣lic
places of entertainment in Paris, I was intro∣duced
into company, by an English family re∣siding
in that city; and, among others, became
acquainted with a French lady, whose charms
were remarkably attractive. The duke of K—
was her admirer; but she lived in reputation
with her mother and an agreeable sister, whose
lover was the prince of C—, (for almost every
lady in France has her <HI>Amant.</HI>)</P>
<P>With this charming woman, whose name was
Madam De la T—, I often made parties of
pleasure. The duke, Mr. S—, she and I,
used to meet in the Bois de Boulogne, which is
a pleasant wood at a small distance from Paris,
whither the company repairs, in the summer∣season,
for the benefit of the air; and after hav∣ing
amused ourselves among the groves, em∣barked
in his grace's equipage, which was ex∣tremely
elegant, being a calash drawn by six
fine long-tailed greys, adorned with ribbons in
the French taste; and thus we were conducted
to a little inchanted, or at least inchanting palace,
possessed by the duke, at one end of the town.
The lower apartment, appropriated to me, was
furnished with yellow and silver, the bed sur∣rounded
with looking glasses, and the door opened
<PB N="110" REF="115"/>
into a garden, laid out in a cradle-walk, and in∣tervening
parterres of roses and other flowers.
Above stairs my female companion lodged, in a
chamber furnished with chintz. We supped all
together in the saloon, which, though small, was
perfectly elegant. The company was always
good-humoured, the conversation sprightly and
joyous, and the scene, though often repeated,
still delightful and entertaining.</P>
<P>At other times, Mr. S—and I used to pass
our evenings at the palace of the prince of C—,
which his highness lent us for our accommoda∣tion.
The apartments opened into the gardens
of the Luxembourg, and were, in point of mag∣nificence,
suitable to the owner. Thither I used
to repair in a flaming equipage, on pretence of
visiting, and spent the best part of the night with
him, who was dearer to me than all the princes
in the world.</P>
<P>While I was happily engaged in these ravishing
parties, my little lord was employed in efforts to
recover his health by restoratives, and I know not
what; for he still lamented the enfeebling effects
of his passion, and complained, that he loved me
more like an angel than a woman, though he
strove to govern his affection according to the
doctrines of the christian religion, as he regu∣lated
his life by the maxims of Charles the twelfth
of Sweden. The meaning of this declaration I
could never learn; and indeed, I have been often
tempted to believe he had no meaning at all.</P>
<P>Be that as it will, I found my size visibly in∣creasing,
and my situation extremely uneasy, on
account of the perpetual wrangling which pre∣vailed
betwixt us, in consequence of his desiring
to sleep with me again, after we had parted beds
<PB N="111" REF="116"/>
for the second time: and, that I might be no
longer exposed to such disagreeable persecution, I
resolved to leave him, though at the hazard of
my life.</P>
<P>Thus determined, I went to the British em∣bassador
in an hackney coach; and, in order to
disguise my youth, which might have prepossessed
him against my judgment, muffled myself up in
a black hood, which (as he said) instead of lending
an air of gravity to my countenance, added a wild∣ness
to my looks, which was far from being dis∣agreeable.
He had been agallant man in his youth,
and even then, though well stricken in years,
was not insensible to the power of beauty. This
disposition, perhaps, rendered him more favour∣able
to my cause, though he at first advised me to
return to my husband; but finding me obstinate, he
undertook to serve me in my own way, and pro∣cure
a protection from the French king, by virtue
of which, I could live at Paris unmolested by my
lord. Nevertheless, he advised me (if I was de∣termined
to leave him) to make the best of my
way to England, and sue for a divorce.</P>
<P>I relished his opinion, and concealed myself
about three days in Paris, during which I bor∣rowed
some linen; for, as it was impossible to
convey any thing out of my own house without
suspicion, I had neither cloaths for my accom∣modation,
nor a servant to wait on me.</P>
<P>In this solitary condition I took the road to
Flanders, after I had put my lord upon a wrong
scent, by writing a letter to him, dated at Calais,
and travelled through an unknown country, with∣out
any other attendant than the postilion, being
subjected to this inconvenience by the laws of
France, which are so severe in some particulars,

that if any person had been apprehended with
me, he would have suffered death, for going
off with a man's wife; though any man might
go to bed with the same woman, without fear or
incurring any legal punishment.</P>
<P>I proceeded night and day without intermis∣sion,
that I might the sooner reach Flanders,
where I knew I should be safe; and as the nights
were excessively cold, I was fain to wrap myself
up in flannel, which I bought for the purpose,
as I had no cloaths to keep me warm, and tra∣velled
in an open chaise. While we passed
through dreary woods, quite remote from the ha∣bitations
of men, I was not without apprehen∣sion
of being stripped and murthered by the po∣stilion;
and, in all probability, owed my safety to
the indigence of my appearance, which might
also protect me in two miserable places where I
was obliged to lie, before I got out of the terr∣tories
of France: for, as I could not reach the
great towns where I intended to lodge, I was
under the necessity of putting up at little wretched
hovels, where no provision was to be had, but
sour brown bread and sourer cheese; and every
thing seemed to denote the dens of despair and a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sassination.</P>
<P>I made shift, however, to subsist on this fare,
uncomfortable as it was, confided in the meanne<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
of my equipage for the security of my person;
and at length arriving at Brussels, fixed my quar∣ters
in the Hotel de Flandre (so well known to the
English since) where I thought myself extremely
happy in the accomplishment of my flight.</P>
<P>I had not been full two days in this place,
when I was blessed with the sight of my lovers
and having concerted measures for proceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="113" REF="118"/>
England, I hired a tall fine Liegeoise for a maid;
and setting out for Ostend, we embarked in a
vessel, in which Mr. S—had bespoke our pas∣sage.
Our voyage was short and prosperous, and
the time most agreeably spent in the company of
my dear partner, who was a most engaging man
in all respects, as I dare say my lady O—has
since found him.</P>
<P>I assumed a fictitious name, took private lodg∣ings
in Poland-street, retained lawyers, and com∣menced
a suit for separation against my lord. I
communicated the reasons of my elopement to
my father, who was shocked and surprised at my
conduct, which he condemned with expressions
of sorrow and resentment. But the step was ta∣ken;
nor did I repent of what I had done, ex∣cept
on his account.</P>
<P>In the morning after my arrival at London, I
waited upon the lord-chief-justice, to whom I
complained of the usage I had received from my
lord, whose temper was teazing, tiresome, and
intolerably capricious. His behaviour was a strange
compound of madness and folly, seasoned with a
small proportion of sense: no wonder then that
I who am hot and hasty, should be wretched,
under the persection of such a perverse hu∣mourist,
who used to terrify me, and scold at
me the whole night without intermission, and
shake my pillow from time to time, that I might
not sleep, while he tormented me with his dis∣agreeable
expostulations. I have been often
frightened almost out of my senses, at seeing
him convulsed by the most unreasonable pas∣sion;
and chagrined to the highest degree of
disgust, to find (by repeated observation) his dis∣position
so preposterous, that his satisfaction and
<PB N="114" REF="119"/>
displeasure never depended upon the cause he had
to be satisfied or disobliged; but, on the con∣trary,
when he had most reason to be pleased, he
was always most discontented, and very often in
good humour, when he had reason enough for
vexation.</P>
<P>While I lived in Poland-street, I was engaged
with lawyers, and so often visited by my father,
that I could not dedicate my whole time, as
usual, to my lover; nor was it convenient that
he should be seen in my company: he therefore
took a small house at Camberwell, whither I
went as often as I had an opportunity; and main∣tained
the correspondence with such eagerness and
industry, that although I was six months gone
with child, I have often, by myself, set out for
his habitation, in an hackney-coach, at eleven
o'clock at night, and returned by six in the morn∣ing,
that I might be in my own bed, when my
father came to see me; for I concealed my amout,
as well as the effects of it, from his knowledge,
and frequently took water from the Bridge, that
my motions might not be discovered. Nothing
but the most passionate love could have sup∣ported
my spirits under such vicissitudes of fi∣tigue,
or enabled my admirer to spend whole
days by himself, in such a solitary retirement.</P>
<P>By this time, my lord was arrived in England
and employed in discovering the place of my re∣treat;
so that I lived in continual alarm, and
provided myself with a speaking-trumpet, which
stood by my bed side, to be used in calling so
asistance, in case my pursuer should make <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
attack upon my lodgings.</P>
<P>This situation being extremely uncomfortable
I had no sooner begun my process against him
<PB N="115" REF="120"/>
than I put myself intirely under the protection of
Mr. S—, who conducted me to the house of a
friend of his who lived in the country, where I
was secure from the attempts of my husband.</P>
<P>The world had now given me up, and I had
renounced the world with the most perfect re∣signation.
I weighed in my own breast what I
should lose in point of character, with what I
suffered in my peace at home, and found, that
my reputation was not to be preserved, except at
the expence of my quiet, (for his lordship was
not disposed to make me easy, had I been never
so discreet.) I therefore determined to give up a
saw ceremonial visits, and empty professions, for
the more substantial enjoyments of life.</P>
<P>We passed our time very agreeably, in various
amusements, with this friend of Mr. S—, until
the term of my reckoning was almost expired,
then returned to London, and took lodgings in
Southampton street, where I began to make pre∣parations
for the approaching occasion. Here I
proposed to live with the utmost circumspection.
I disguised my name, saw nobody but my lawyer
and lover, and never approached the window,
lest I should be discovered by accident.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding these precautions, my French
maid, whom I had sent for some of my cloaths,
was dogged in her return, and next morning my
lord took my lodgings by storm. Had he gi∣ven
the assault in his own person only, I make
no doubt but he would have suffered a repulse,
from the opposition of the Ligeoise, who made
all the resistance in her power, but was obliged
to give way to superior number.</P>
<P>I was at that time abed, and hearing an un∣usual
noise below, rung my bell, in order to
<PB N="116" REF="121"/>
know the cause of such disturbance. I drew my
curtain at the same time, and who should I see
entering my chamber but his lordship, attended
by a constable, and the sootman who had detected
my retreat!</P>
<P>Such an unexpected visit could not fail to affect
me with surprize and consternation: however, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
summoned all my fortitude to my aid, and per∣ceiving
the fellows were about to open my window-shutters
desired their principal to order them down∣stairs.
He readily complied with my request, and
sitting down by my bed-side, told me with an a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
of triumph, that he had found me at last; and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
frankly owned, that I was heartily sorry for his
success. Instead of upbraiding me with me
escape, he proceeded to entertain me with all the
news in town, and gave me a minute detail of
every thing which had happened to him since our
parting; among other articles of intelligence,
giving me to understand, that he had cha'lenged
Mr. S—, who had refused to fight him, and
was in disgrace with the prince of W—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that account.</P>
<P>But here his lordship did not strictly adhere to
the naked truth: he had indeed, before our de∣parture
for the country, gone to my lover, and
insisted upon having satisfaction in Hyde-park,
two days from the date of his demand, and at
three o'clock in the afternoon; S—believing
him in earnest, accepted the invitation; thou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
he observed, that these affairs could not be dis∣cussed
too soon, and wished the time of meeting
might be at an earlier hour. But his lordship
did not choose to alter the circumstances of has
first proposal; and when he went away, said <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="117" REF="122"/>
should expect him at the appointed time and
place, if it did not rain.</P>
<P>His antagonist gave me an account of the con∣versation,
when I assured him the whole business
would end in smoke. Accordingly, my lord sent
him a letter on Monday, desiring that the assig∣nation
might be deserred till Thursday, that he
might have time to settle his affairs, and pay S—
an hundred pounds, which he had formerly bor∣rowed
of him. When Thursday came, he was
favoured with another epistle, importing, that
the challenger had changed his mind, and would
seek satisifaction at law. Thus ended that heroic
exploit, which his lordship now boasted of with
such arrogant misrepresentation.</P>
<P>Whilst he regaled me with these interesting par∣ticulars,
I was contriving a scheme to srustrate
the discovery he had made; so that I did not con∣tradict
his assertions, but told him, that if he
would go down stairs, I would rise and come to
breakfast. He consented to this proposal with
great chearfulness; and I own, I was not a little
surprized to find him, at this first interview, in
as good humour, as if nothing had happened to
interrupt the felicity of our matrimonial union.</P>
<P>It cost me some invention to conceal my con∣dition
from his notice, being now within a week
of the expected crisis: but I knew I had to do
with a man of no great penetration, and suc∣ceeded
in my attempt accordingly. We break∣fasted
with great harmony, and I invited him to
dinner, after having prevailed upon him to send
away his myrmidons, whom, nevertheless, he
ordered to return at eleven o'clock at night.
We conversed together with great gaiety and
mirth; and when I rallied him for visiting me in
<PB N="118" REF="123"/>
such a dishabille, he stood a tiptoe to view him∣self
in the glass; and owning I was in the right,
said he would go and dress himself before dinner.</P>
<P>He accordingly went away, charging my maid
to give him entrance at his return; and he was
no sooner gone than I wrote to Mr. S—. giv∣ing
him an account of what had happened; then,
without having determined upon any certain
plan, huddled on my cloaths, muffled myself up,
and calling a chair, went to the next tavern,
where I stayed no longer than was sufficient to
change my vehicle; and, to the astonishment of
the drawers, who could not conceive the mean∣ing
of my perturbation, proceeded to a shop in
the neighbourhood, where I dismissed my second
chair, and procured an hackney coach, in which
I repaired to the lodgings of my lawyer, whom I
could trust. Having made him acquainted with
the circumstances of my distress, and consulted
him about a proper place of retreat, after some
recollection he directed me to a little house in a
court, to which, by the assistance of my lover,
my woman and cloaths were safely conveyed that
same evening.</P>
<P>My lord, however, came to dinner, accord∣ing
to invitation, and did not seem at all alarmed
when my maid told him I was gone, but stepped
to my lawyer, to know if he thought I should re∣turn;
and upon his answering in the affirmative,
and advising his lordship to go back in the mean
time, and eat the dinner I had provided, he very
deliberately took his advice, made a very hearty
meal, drank his bottle of wine, and, as I did not
return, according to his expectation, withdrew,
in order to consult his associates.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="124"/>
This motion of his furnished my woman with
an opportunity of making her retreat; and when
he returned at night, the coast was clear, and he
found no body in the house but a porter, who
had been left to take care of the furniture. He
was so enraged at this disappointment, that he
made a furious noise, which raised the whole
neighbourhood, reinforced his crew with the au∣thority
of a justice of the peace, tarried in the
street till three o'clock in the morning, discharg∣ed
a lodging he had hired at a barber's shop, op∣posite
to the house from which I had escaped, and
retired with the comfortable reflexion of having
done every thing which man could do to retrieve
me.</P>
<P>The hurry of spirits, and surprize I had un∣dergone
in effecting this retreat, produced such a
disorder in my constitution, that I began to fear
I should be delivered before I could be provided
with necessaries for the occasion. I signified my
apprehension to Mr. S—, who with infinite
care and concern endeavoured to find a more
convenient place; and, after all his inquiries,
was obliged to fix upon a paultry apartment in the
city, tho' his tenderness was extremely shocked
at the necessity of choosing it. However, there
was no remedy, nor time to be lost: to this mi∣serable
habitation I was carried in an hackney
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; and, tho' extremely ill, bore my fate
with spirit and resignation, in testimony of my
sincere and indelible attachment to my lover,
for whose ease and pleasure I could have suffered
every inconvenience, and even sacrificed my
life.</P>
<P>Immed<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ately after I had taken possession of my
wretch apartment, I was constrained by <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="120" REF="125"/>
disposition to go to bed, and send for the neces∣sary
help; and in a few hours a living pledge of
my love and indiscretion saw the light, tho' the
terrors and fatigue I had undergone had affected
this little innocent so severely, that it scarce dis∣covered
any visible signs of life.</P>
<P>My grief at this misfortune was inexpressible:
I forthwith dispatched a message to the dear, the
anxious father, who flew to my arms, and shared
my sorrow, with all the gentleness of love and
parental fondness; yet our fears were happily
disappointed by the recovery of our infant daugh∣ter,
who was committed to the charge of a nurse
in the neighbourhood; so that I could every day
be satisfied in my inquiries about her health.
Thus I continued a whole fortnight, in a state
of happiness and tranquillity, being blessed with the
conversation and tender offices of my admirer,
whose love and attention I wholly ingrossed. In
a word, he gave up all business and amusement,
and concentred all his care and assiduity in mi∣nistring
to my ease and satisfaction. And sure I
had no cause to regret what I had suffered on his
account.</P>
<P>But this my agreeable situation was one day
disturbed by a most alarming accident, by which
my life was drawn into imminent danger. The
room under my bed-chamber took fire; I imme∣diately
smelled it, and saw the people about me
in the utmost perplexity and consternation, tho'
they would not own the true cause of their con∣fusion,
left my health should suffer in the fright.
Nevertheless I was so calm in my inquiries, that
they ventured to tell me my suspicion was but too
just: upon which I gave such directions as I
thought would secure me from catching cold, in
<PB N="121" REF="126"/>
case there should be a necessity for removing me;
but the fire being happily extinguished, I escaped
that ceremony, which might have cost me my
life. Indeed it was surprising, that the agitation
of my spirits did not produce some fatal effect up∣on
my constitution; and I looked upon my deli∣verance
as the protection of a particular provi∣dence.</P>
<P>Tho' I escaped the hazard of a sudden remo∣val,
I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound it was high time to change my lodg∣ings,
because the neighbours rushing into the
house, upon the alarm of fire, had discovered
my situation, though they were ignorant of
my name; and I did not think myself safe, in
being the subject of their conjectures. Mr. S—
therefore procured another apartment, with bet∣ter
accommodation, to which I was carried, as
soon as my health would admit of my removal;
and soon after my lord wrote to me, by the
hands of my lawyer, earnestly intreating me to
drop my prosecution, and come home. But I
would not comply with his request; and nothing
was farther from my intention than the desire of
receiving any favours at his hands.</P>
<P>Thus repulsed, he set on foot a most accurate
search for my person; in the course of which he
is said to have detected several ladies and young
girls, who had reasons for keeping themselves
concealed; and had like to have been very se∣verely
handled for his impertinent curiosity. Be∣ing
unsuccessful in all his attempts, he entered
into treaty with one Sir R—H—, a person of a
very indifferent character, who undertook to fur∣nish
him with an infallible expedient to discover
the place of my abode, if he would gratify him
with a bond for a thousand pounds; which be∣ing
executed accordingly, this worthy knight ad∣vertised
<PB N="122" REF="127"/>
me and my maid in the public papers,
offering one hundred pounds as a reward to any
person who should disclose the place of our re∣tirement.</P>
<P>As soon as the paper fell into my hands I was
again involved in perplexity; and being afraid of
staying in town, resolved, with the concurrence
of my lover, to accept of an invitation I had re∣ceived
from the duke of K—, who had by this
time arrived in England, with that lady whom
I have already mentioned, as one of our parties
at Paris. Having visited my little insant, I next
day set out for the duke's country-seat, which is
a most elegant <HI>chateau,</HI> and stands in a charming
situation: Mr. S—followed in a few days; we
met with a very cordial reception; his grace
was civil and good-natured, lived nobly and
loved pleasure; Madam la T—was formed to
please: there was always a great deal of good
company in the house; so that we passed our
time agreeably in playing at billiards and cards,
hunting, walking, reading and conversation.</P>
<P>But my terms of happiness were generally of
short duration. In the midst of all this felicity
I was overtaken by a most severe affliction, in the
death of my dear hapless infant, who had in∣grossed
a greater share of my tenderness than per∣haps
I even should have paid to the offspring of a
legitimate contract, because the circumstance of
her birth would have been an unsurmountable
misfortune to her thro' the whole course of her
life, and rendered her absolutely dependent on
my love and protection.</P>
<P>While I still lamented the untimely fate of
this fair blossom, lord—came down, and de∣manded
me as his wife; but the suit which I then
<PB N="123" REF="128"/>
maintained against him deprived him, for the pre∣sent,
of an husband's right; and therefore the
duke would not deliver me into his hands.</P>
<P>In six months he repeated his visit and de∣mand;
and an agreement was patched up, in
consequence of which I consented to live in the
same house with him, on condition that he
should never desire to sleep with me, or take any
other measure to disturb my peace; otherwise I
should be at liberty to leave him again, and in∣titled
to the provision of a separate maintenance.
To these articles I assented, by the advice of my
lawyers, with a view of obtaining the payment
of my pin-money, which I had never received
since our parting, but subsisted on the sale of my
jewels, which were very considerable, and had
been presented to me with full power of aliena∣tion.
As to my lover, he had no fortune to sup∣port
me; and for that reason I was scrupulously
cautious of augmenting his expence.</P>
<P>We had now enjoyed each other's company
for three years, during which our mutual passion
had suffered no abatement, nor had my happi∣ness
been mixed with any considerable allay, ex∣cept
that late stroke of providence which I have
already mentioned, and the reflexion of the sor∣row
that my conduct had intailed upon my dear
father, whom I loved beyond expression, and
whom nothing could have compelled me to dis∣oblige
but a more powerful flame, that prevailed
over every other consideration. As I was now
forced to break off this inchanting correspondence,
it is not to be doubted that our parting cost us the
most acute sensations of grief and disappointment.
However, there was no remedy: I tore myself
from his arms, took my leave of the family, after
<PB N="124" REF="129"/>
having acknowledged my obligations to the duke,
and set out for the place of rendezvous, where I
was met by my lord, attended by a steward whom
he had lately engaged, and who was one chief
cause of our future separations. My lord having
quitted his house in town, conducted me to his
lodgings in Pall-Mall, and insisted upon sleeping
with me the first night; but I refused to grati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
his desire, on the authority of our agreement.</P>
<P>This dispute produced a quarrel, in conse∣quence
of which I attempted to leave the house;
and he endeavouring to prevent my retreat, I
fairly locked him in, ran down stairs, and calling
a hackney coach, made the best of my way into
the city, to my father's lodgings, where I lay,
the family being in town, tho' he himself was in
the country. I wrote to him immediately, and
when he came to London, declared my intention
of separating from my lord, with which, seeing
me obstinate and determined, he at length ac∣quiesced,
and a formal separation accordingly en∣sued,
which at that time I thought binding and
immutable.</P>
<P>I was now sheltered under the wings of an in∣dulgent
father, who had taken me into favour
again, on the supposition that my commerce
with Mr. S—was absolutely at an end. Never∣theless,
tho' we had separated, in all appearance,
for ever, we had previously agreed to maintain
our correspondence in private interviews, which
should escape the notice of the world, with
which I was again obliged to keep some mea∣sures.</P>
<P>Our parting at the duke of K—'s house in the
country was attended with all the genuine marks
of sincere and reciprocal affection, and I lived in
<PB N="125" REF="130"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he sweet hope of seeing him again, in all the
transport of his former passion, when my lawyer,
who received my letters, brought me a billet one
night, just as I had gone to bed. Seeing the su∣perscription
of S—'s hand-writing, I opened it
with all the impatience of an absent lover; but
how shall I describe the astonishment and con∣sternation
with which I was seized, when I pe∣rused
the contents! Instead of the most tender
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows and protestations, this fatal epistle began
with, <HI>Madam, the best thing you can do is to re∣turn
to your father;</HI> or some cold and killing
expression, to that effect.</P>
<P>Heaven and earth! what did I feel at this dire
conjancture! The light forsook my eyes, a cold
sweat bedewed my limbs, and I was overwhelm∣ed
with such a torrent of sorrow and surprize,
that every body present believed I would have
died under the violent agitation. They endea∣voured
to support my spirits with repeated draughts
of strong liquor, which had no sensible effect up∣on
my constitution, tho' for eight whole years I
had drank nothing stronger than water; and I
must have infallibly perished in the first extasy of
my grief, had it not made its way in a fit of tears
and exclamation, in which I continued all night,
to the amazement of the family, whom my con∣dition
had alarmed, and raised from their repose.
My father was the only person who guessed the
cause of my affliction; he said he was sure I had
received some ill usage in a letter or message from
that rascal S—(so he termed him in the bitter∣ness,
of passion).</P>
<P>At mention of that name my agony redoubled
to such a degree, that all who were present wept
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of my deplorable condition. My poor
<PB N="126" REF="131"/>
father shed a flood of tears, and conjured me to tell
him the cause of my disquiet: upon which, rather
than confess the truth, I amused his concern,
by pretending that my lover was ill. The whole
family having stayed by me till I was a little more
composed, left me to the care of my maid, who
put me into bed about six in the morning; but I
enjoyed no rest: I revolved every circumstance
of my conduct, endeavouring to find out the
cause of this fatal change in S—'s disposition; and
as I could recollect nothing which could justly
give offence, concluded that some malicious per∣sons
had abused his ears with stories to my pre∣judice.</P>
<P>With this conjecture I got up, and sent my
lawyer to him with a letter, wherein I insisted
upon seeing him, that I might have an opportu∣nity
of justifying myself in person; a task which
would be easily performed, as I had never offend∣ed,
but in loving too well. I waited with the
most anxious impatience for the return of my
messenger, who brought me an answer couched
in the coldest terms of civility which indifference
could dictate; acknowledging, however, that he
had nothing to lay to my charge, but that it was
for the good of us both we should part.—He
ought to have reflected on that before, not after
I had sacrificed my all for his love! I was well
nigh distracted by this confirmation of his incon∣stancy;
and I wonder to this day how I retained
the use of reason, under such circumstances of
horror and despair! My grief laid aside all de∣corum
and restraint; I told my father that S—
was dying, and that I would visit him with all
expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="132"/>
Startled at the proposal, this careful parent de∣monstrated
the fatal consequence of such an un∣guarded
step, reminded me of the difficulty with
which he had prevailed upon my mother and
uncle to forgive my former imprudence, observ∣ed
that his intention was to carry me into the
country next day, in order to effect a perfect re∣conciliation;
but now I was on the brink of forfeit∣ing
all pretensions to their regard, by committing
another fatal error, which could not possibly be
retrieved; and that for his part, whatever pangs
it might cost him, he was resolved to banish me
from his sight for ever.</P>
<P>While he uttered this declaration the tears
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> down his cheeks, and he seemed over∣whelmed
with the keenest sorrow and mortifica∣tion;
so it may be easily conceived what were
the impressions of my grief, reinforced with the
affliction of a father whom I dearly loved, and
the consciousness of being the cause of all his dis∣quiet!
I was struck dumb with remorse and
woe; and when I recovered the use of speech, I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him how sensible I was of his great goodness
and humanity, and owned how little I deserved
his favour and affection; that the sense of my
own unworthiness was one cause of my present
distraction; for such was the condition of my
fate, that I must either see S—or die. I said,
tho' I could not expect his forgiveness, I was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> worthy of his compassion; that nothing
but the most irresistible passion could have misled
me at first from my duty, or tempted me to incur
the least degree of his displeasure; that the same
fatal influence still prevailed, and would, in all
probability, continue to the grave, which was
the only abode in which I hoped for peace.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="133"/>
While I expressed myself in this manner, my
dear good father wept with the most tender sym∣pathy,
and saying I might do as I pleased, for he
had done with me, quitted the room, leaving me
to the cruel sensations of my own heart, which
almost bursted with anguish, upbraiding me with
a fault which I could not help committing.</P>
<P>I immediately hired a chariot and fix, and
would have set out by myself, had not my fa∣ther's
affection, which all my errors could not
efface, provided an attendant. He saw me quite
delirious and desperate; and therefore engaged a
relation of my own to accompany and take care
of me in this rash expedition.</P>
<P>During this journey, which lasted two days, I
felt no remission of grief and anxiety, but under∣went
the most intolerable sorrow and suspense:
at last we arrived at a little house called the Hut,
on Salisbury plain, where, in the most frantie
agitation, I wrote a letter to S—, describing the
miserable condition to which I was reduced by
his unkindness, and desiring to see him, with the
most earnest sollicitations.</P>
<P>This billet I committed to the care of my at∣tendant,
and laid strong injunctions upon him to
tell Mr. S—, my injuries were so great, and
my despair so violent, that if he did not favour
me with a visit, I would go to him, though at his
sister's house, where he then was.</P>
<P>He received my message with great coldness,
and told my friend, that if I would return to
London, without insisting upon the interview I
demanded, he would in a little time follow me to
town, and every thing should be amicably ad∣justed.
But when the messenger assured him,
that I was too much transported with grief, to
<PB N="129" REF="134"/>
hear of such a proposal, he consented to meet
me in the middle of Salisbury-plain, that we
might avoid all observation: and though I was
little able to walk, I set out on foot for the place
of assignation, my companion following at a small
distance.</P>
<P>When I saw him leading his horse down the
hill, I collected all my fortitude, and advanced
to him with all the speed I could exert; but when
I made an effort to speak, my tongue denied its
office; and so lively was the expression of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
forrow in my countenance, that his
heart hard as it was) melted at sight of my suf∣ferings,
which he well knew proceeded from the
sincerity of my love. At length I recovered the
use of speech, enough to tell him, that I was
come to take my leave; and when I would have
proceeded, my voice failed me again: but, after
a considerable pause, I found means, with great
difficulty, to let him know how sensible I was of
my own incapacity to retrieve his lost affections;
but that I was willing (if possible) to retain his
esteem, of which, could I be assured, I would
endeavour to compose myself; that I was deter∣mined
to leave the kingdom, because I could not
bear the sight of those places where we had been
so happy in our mutual love; and that, till my
departure, I hoped he would visit me sometimes,
that I might, by degrees, wean myself from his
company; for, I should not be able to survive the
shock of being deprived of him all at once.</P>
<P>This address may seem very humble to an un∣concerned
observer; but love will tame the
proudest disposition, as plainly appeared in my
case; for I had naturally as much spirit, or more,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the generality of people have, Mr. S—
<PB N="130" REF="135"/>
was so much confounded at the manner of my
behaviour, that he scarce knew what answer to
make; for (as he afterwards owned) he ex∣pected
to hear himself upbraided; but he was not
proof against my tenderness. After some hesita∣tion,
he said he never meant to forsake me in∣tirely,
that his affection was still unimpaired, and
that he would follow me directly to London. I
imposed upon myself, and believed what he said,
because I could not bear to think of parting with
him for ever, and returned to town in a more
tranquil state of mind than that in which I had
left my father, though my heart was far from
being at ease; my fears being ingenious enough
to foresee, that I should never be able to overcome
his indifference.</P>
<P>I took lodgings in Mount-street, and my maid
having disposed of herself in marriage, hired an∣other,
who supplied her place very much to my
satisfaction; she was a good girl, had a particular
attachment to me, and for many years, during
which she lived in my service, was indefatigably
assiduous in contributing to my ease, or rather,
in alleviating my affliction: for, though S—
came up to town according to promise, and re∣newed
a sort of correspondence with me for the
space of five months, his complaisance would ex∣tend
no farther; and he gave me to understand,
that he had determined to go abroad with Mr.
V—, whom he accordingly accompanied in his
envoyship to D—n.</P>
<P>I understood the real cause of this expedition,
which, notwithstanding his oaths and protesta∣tions
of unabated love and regard, I construed
into a palpable mark of dislike and disrespect; no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
could the repeated assurances I received from him
<PB N="131" REF="136"/>
in letters, mitigate the anguish and mortification
that preyed upon my heart. I therefore gave up
all hopes of recovering the happiness I had lost:
I told him, on the eve of his departure, that he
might exercise his gallantry a great while, before he
would meet with my fellow, in point of sincerity
and love; for I would rather have been a servant
in his house, with the privilege of seeing him,
than the queen of England, debarred of that
pleasure.</P>
<P>When he took his leave, and went down stairs,
I shrunk at every step he made, as if a new
wound had been inflicted upon me; and when I
heard the door shut behind him, my heart died
within me. (I had the satisfaction to hear af∣terwards,
he lamented the loss of me prodi∣giously,
and that he had never been so happy
since.) I sat down to write a letter, in which
I forgave his indifference, because I knew
the affections are altogether involuntary, and
wished him all the happiness he deserved. I then
walked up and down the room in the most rest∣less
anxiety, was put to bed by my maid, rose at
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, mounted my horse, and rode forty miles, in
order to fatigue myself, that I might, next night,
enjoy some repose. This exercise I daily under∣went
for months together; and when it did not
answer my purpose, I used to walk round Hyde∣park
in the evening, when the place was qui e
solitary, and unvisited by any other human crea∣ture.</P>
<P>In the course of this melancholy perambula∣tion,
I was one day accosted by a very great
man, who, after the first salutation, asked whe∣ther
or not my intercourse with S—was at as∣end;
and if I had any allowance from my hus∣band?
<PB N="132" REF="137"/>
To the first of these questions I replied
in the affirmative; and to the last answered, that
my lord did not allow me a great deal; indeed I
might have truly said, nothing at all: but I was
too proud to own my indigence. He then ex∣pressed
his wonder, how one like me, who had
been used to splendor and affluence from my
cradle, could make shift to live in my present
narrow circumstances; and when I told him that
I could make a very good shift, so I had peace,
he seemed to lament my situation, and very
kindly invited me to sup with his wife, at his
house. I accepted the invitation, without any
apprehension of the consequence; and when I
went to the place, was introduced into an apart∣ment,
magnificently lighted up (I suppose) for
my reception.</P>
<P>After I had stayed alone for some time in this
mysterious situation, without seeing a living
soul, my inviter appeared, and said, he hoped I
would not take it amiss, that he and I were to
sup by ourselves, as he had something to say,
which could not be so properly communicated
before company or servants. I then, for the
first time, perceived his drift, to my no small
surprize and indignation; and with evident marks
of displeasure told him, I was sure he had no∣thing
to propose that would be agreeable to my
inclination, and that I would immediately leave
the house. Upon which, he gave me to under∣stand,
that I could not possibly retire, because
he had sent away my chair, and all his servants
were disposed to obey his orders.</P>
<P>Incensed at this declaration, which I considered
as an insult, I answered with an air of resolu∣tion,
it was very well; I despised his contrivance,
<PB N="133" REF="138"/>
and was afraid of nobody. Seeing me thus
alarmed, he assured me I had no reason to be
afraid; that he had loved me long, and could
find no other opportunity of declaring his passion.
He said, the Q—had told him, that lord C—
had renewed his addresses to me; and as he un∣derstood
from my own mouth, my correspon∣dence
with S—was absolutely broke off, he
thought himself as well intitled as another to my
regard. In conclusion, he told me, that I might
command his purse, and that he had power
enough to bring me into the world again with
<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>clat.</HI> To these advances I replied, that he was
very much mistaken in his opinion of my cha∣racter,
if he imagined I was to be won by any
temptations of fortune, and very frankly de∣clared,
that I would rather give myself to a foot∣man,
than sell myself to a prince.</P>
<P>Supper being served, we sat down together;
but I would neither eat nor drink any thing,
except a little bread and water; for I was an odd
whimsical girl; and it came into my head, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he might, perhaps, have mixed something in the
victuals or wine, which would alter my way of
thinking. In short, finding himself bassled in
all his endeavours, he permitted me, about twelve
o'clock, to depart in peace, and gave up his suit,
as a desperate cause.</P>
<P>This uncomfortable life did I lead for a whole
twelvemonth, without feeling the least abatement
of my melancholy; and finding myself worn to
a skeleton, I resumed my former resolution of
trying to profit by change of place, and actually
went abroad with no other attendant but my wo∣man,
and the utmost indifference for life. My
Intention was to have gone to the South of
<PB N="134" REF="139"/>
France, where I thought I could have subsisted
on the little I had left, which amounted to five
hundred pounds, until the issue of my law-suit,
by which I hoped to obtain some provision from
my lord; and, without all doubt, my expecta∣tion
would have been answered, had I put this
my plan in execution: but being at Paris, from
whence I purposed to set forward in a few days, I
sent to Mr. K—, who had been formerly
intimate with my father, and shewn me many ci∣vilities
during my first residence in France.</P>
<P>This gentleman favoured me with a visit, and
when I made him acquainted with my scheme,
dissuaded me from it, as an uncomfortable deter∣mination,
and advised me to stay at Paris, where,
with good oeconomy, I could live as cheap as in any
other place, and enjoy the conversation and coun∣tenance
of my friends, among which number re∣declared
himself one of the most faithful; assuring
me, that I should be always welcome to his table,
and want for nothing; and promising to recom∣mend
me as a lodger to a friend of his, with
whom I would live in a frugal and decent man∣ner;
and that, as the woman was well known
and esteemed by all the English company in Paris,
it would be the most reputable step I could take,
(considering my youth and situation) to lodge
with a creditable person, who could answer for
my conduct. Thus persuaded, I very simply
followed his advice; I say simply, because, not∣withstanding
his representations, I soon found my
money melt away, without any prospect of
fresh supply. In lieu of this, however, I passed
my time very agreeably in several English
and some French families, where, in a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="135" REF="140"/>
time, I became quite intimate, saw a great deal
of company, and was treated with the utmost
politeness and regard; yet, in the midst of these
pleasures, many a melancholy sigh would rise at
the remembrance of my beloved S—, whom
for several years I could not recollect without
emotion; but time, company, amusements, and
change of place, in a great measure dissipated
these ideas, and enabled me to bear my fate with
patience and resignation.</P>
<P>On my last arrival at Paris, I was surrounded
by a croud of professed admirers, who sighed and
flattered in the usual forms; but, besides that my
heart was not yet in a condition to contract new
engagements, I was prepossessed against them all,
by supposing that they presumed upon the know∣ledge
of my indiscretion with S—; and
therefore rejected their addresses with detestation
and disdain: for, as I have already observed, I
was not to be won, but by the appearance of
esteem and the most respectful carriage; and
though, by a false step, I had, in my own opi∣nion,
forfeited my title to the one, I was resolved
to discourage the advances of any man who seemed
d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ficient in the other.</P>
<P>In this manner, my lovers were, one by one,
repulsed, almost as soon as they presented them∣selves,
and I preserved the independance of my
heart, until I became acquainted with a certain
peer, whom I often saw at the house of Mrs.
P—, an English lady then resident at Paris.
This young nobleman professed himself deeply
cram used of me, in a stile so different from that
of my other admirers, that I heard <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
were without disgust; and though my inclinations
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still free, could not find in my heart to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>countenance his addresses, which were pre∣ferred
<PB N="136" REF="141"/>
with the most engaging modesty, disin∣terestedness
and respect.</P>
<P>By these never-failing arts, he gradually con∣quered
my indifference, and gained the preference
in my esteem from lord C—y and the prince
of C—, who were at that time his rivals.
But what contributed (more than any considera∣tion)
to his success, was his declaring openly,
that he would marry me without hesitation, as
soon as I could obtain a divorce from my present
husband, which, in all probability, might have
been easily procured; for before I left England,
lord—had offered me five thousand pounds,
if I would consent to such a mutual release, that
he might be at liberty to espouse one Miss W—
of Kent, to whom be then made love upon ho∣nourable
terms: but I was fool enough to refuse
his proposal, by the advice of S—: and whe∣ther
or not his lordship finding it impracticable to
wed his new mistress, began to make love upon
another footing, I know not; but certain it is,
the mother forbad him the house, a circumstance
which he took so heinously ill, that he appealed
to the world in a public advertisement, begin∣ning
with, <HI>Whereas, for some time, I have pas∣sionatcly
loved Miss</HI> W—, <HI>and upon my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
complying with the mother's proposals, they have
earned me out of doors; this is to justify,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>This declaration, signed with his name, was
actually printed in a number of detached adver∣tisements,
which he ordered to be distributed to
the public; and afterwards, being convinced by
some of his friends, that he had done a very filly
thing, he recalled them at half a guinea apiece.
A copy of one of them was sent to me at Paris,
and I believe my father has now one of the or∣ginals
in his possession. After this wise vindica∣tion
<PB N="137" REF="142"/>
of his conduct, he made an attempt to carry
off the lady from church, by force of arms; but
she was resecued by the neighbours, headed by her
brother who being an attorney, had like to have
made his lordship smart severely for this explort.</P>
<P>Mean while, my new admirer had made some
progress in my heart; and my finances being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
I was reduced to the alternative of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
to lord—again, or accepting earl
B—<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s love. When my affairs were brought
to that issue, I made no hesitation in my choice,
putting myself under the protection of a man of
honour, whom I esteemed, rather than suffer
every sort of mortification, from a person who
was the object of my abhorrence and contempt.
From a mistaken pride, I chose to live in lord
B—k's house, rather than be maintained at his
expence in any other place. We spent several
months agreeably in balls and other diversions, vi∣sited
lord B—k, who lived at the distance of a few
kagues from Paris, and staved some days at <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> where the entertainment was, in all respect,
delightful, elegant, and refined. Their habitation
was the rendezvous of the best company in
France; and lady B—k maintained the same su∣periority
in her own sex, for which her lord is
so justly distinguished among the men.</P>
<P>About Christmas we set out for England, ac∣companied
by a little North Briton, who lived
with lord B—as his companion, and did not
at all approve of our correspondence; whether
out of real friendship for his patron, or appre∣hension
that in time I might supersede his own
influence with my lord, I shall not pretend to
determine. Be that as it will, the frost was so
severe, that we were detained ten days at Calais,
before we could get out of the harbour; and
<PB N="133" REF="143"/>
during that time, I reflected seriously on what
my new lover had proposed: as he was very
young, and unacquainted with the world, I
thought my story might have escaped him; and
therefore determined to give him a faithful detail
of the whole, that he might not have any thing
to reproach me with in the sequel; besides, I did
not think it honest to engage him to do more
for me than he might afterwards, perhaps, think
I was worth. Accordingly, I communicated to
him every particular of my life; and the narra∣tion,
far from altering his sentiments, rather
confirmed his good opinion, by exhibiting an
undoubted proof of my frankness and sincerity.
In short, he behaved with such generosity, as
made an absolute conquest of my heart: but my
love was of a different kind from that which had
formerly reigned within my breast, being founded
upon the warmest gratitude and esteem, exclu∣sive
of any other consideration, though his person
was very agreeable, and his address engaging.</P>
<P>When we arrived in England, I went directly
to his country-seat, about twelve miles from
London, where he soon joined me, and we
lived some time in perfect retirement, his relations
being greatly alarmed with the apprehension that
lord—would bring an action against him;
though he himself desired nothing more, and
lived so easily under that expectation, that they
soon laid aside their fears on his account.</P>
<P>We were visited by Mr. H—B—, a re∣lation
of my lord, and one Mr. R—of the
guards, who, with the little Scotch gentleman
and my lover, made an agreeable set, among
whom I enjoyed hunting, and all manner of
country diversions. As to Mr. H—B—
<PB N="139" REF="144"/>
if ever there was perfection in one man, it cen∣tered
in him; or at least, he, of all the men I
ever knew, approached nearest to that idea which
I had conceived of a perfect character. He was
both good and great, possessed an uncommon
genius and the best of hearts. Mr. R—was a
very sociable man, had a good person and culti∣vated
understanding; and my lord was excessively
good humoured; so that, with such companions,
no place could be dull or insipid: for my own
part, I conducted the family; and as I endea∣voured
to please and make every body hap∣py,
I had the good fortune to succeed. Mr. B—
told me, that before he saw me, he heard I was
a f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ol; but finding (as he was pleased to say)
that I had been egregiously misrepresented, he
courted my friendship, and a correspondence com∣menced
between us: indeed, it was impossible
for any person to know him, without entertain∣ing
the utmost esteem and veneration for his
virtue.</P>
<P>After I had lived some time in this agreeable
retreat, my husband began to make a bustle: he
sent a message, demanding me from lord B—;
then came in person, with his night-cap in his
pocket, intending to have stayed all night, had
he been asked, and attended by a relation, whom
he assured that I was very fond of him, and de∣tained
by force from his arms.</P>
<P>Finding himself disappointed in his expecta∣tions,
he commenced a law-suit against lord B—,
though not for a divorce, as we desired, but
with a view to reclaim me as his lawful wife.
His lawyers, however, attempted to prove cri∣minal
conversation, in hopes of extorting money
from my lover; but their endeavours were alto∣gether
<PB N="140" REF="145"/>
fruitless; for no servant of lord B—'s
or mine, could with justice say, we were ever
seen to trespass against modesty and decorum; so
that the plaintiff was nonsuited.</P>
<P>While this cause was depending, all my lo∣ver's
friends expressed fear and concern for the
issue, while he himself behaved with the utmost
resolution, and gave me such convincing proofs
of a strong and steady affection, as augmented
my gratitude, and rivetted the ties of my love,
which was unblemished, faithful and sincere.</P>
<P>Soon after this event, I was seized with a vio∣lent
fit of illness, in which I was visited by my
father, and attended by two physicians, one of
whom desparied of my life, and took his leave
accordingly; but Dr. S—, who was the other,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his attendance, and, in all human
appearance, saved my life; a circumstance by
which he acquired a great share of reputation:
yet, notwithstanding all his assistance, I was con∣fined
to my bed for ten weeks; during which,
lord B—'s grief was immoderate, his care and
generosity unlimited. Whilst I lay in this ex∣tremity,
Mr. S—, penetrated by my melan∣choly
condition, which revived his tenderness,
begg'd leave to be admitted to my presence; and
lord B—would have complied with his re∣quest,
had I not been judged too weak to beat
the shock of such an interview. My constitu∣tion,
however, agreeably disappointed their fears;
and the fever had no sooner left me, than I was
removed to a hunting seat belonging to my lover,
from whence, after I had recovered my strength,
we went to B—Castle, where we kept open
house: and while we remained at this place, lord
B—received a letter from lord—, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="141" REF="146"/>
in November, challenging him to single combat
in May, upon the frontiers of France and Flan∣ders.
This defiance was sent in consequence of
what had passed betwixt them long before my in∣disposition,
at a meeting in a certain tavern, where
they quarrelled, and in the fray my lover threw
his antagonist under the table. I counselled him
to take no notice of this rhodomontade, which I
knew was void of all intention of performance;
and he was wise enough to follow my advice;
resolved, however, should the message be re∣peated,
to take the challenger at his word.</P>
<P>Having resided some time in this place, we re∣turned
to the other country-house which we had
kit, where lord B—addicted himself so much
to hunting, and other male diversions, that I be∣gan
to think he neglected me, and apprized him
of my suspicion; assuring him, at the same time,
that I would leave him as soon as my opinion
should be confirmed.</P>
<P>This declaration had no effect upon his beha∣viour,
which became so remarkably cold, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mr. R—, who lived with us, imagined
that his affection was palpably diminished. When
swent to town, I was usually attended by his
cousin, or this gentleman, or both, but seldom
favoured with his company; nay, when I repair∣ed
to Bath, for the re-establishment of my health,
he permitted me to go alone; so that I was quite
persuaded of his indifference; and yet, I was mis∣taken
in my opinion: but, I had been spoiled by
the behaviour of my first husband, and Mr. S—,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never quitted me for the sake of any a∣musement,
and often resisted the calls of the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> business, rather than part from me, tho'
but for a few hours. I thought every man who
<PB N="142" REF="147"/>
loved me truly, would act in the same manner;
and whether I am right or wrong in my conjec∣tures,
I leave wiser casuists to judge. Certain it
is, such sacrifice and devotion is the most pleasing
proof of an admirer's passion; and <HI>Voyez <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
plus souvent, &amp; ne mé donnez rien,</HI> is one of my
favourite maxims. A man may give money, be∣cause
he is profuse; he may be violently fond, be∣cause
he is of a sanguine constitution; but if he
gives me his time, he gives me an unquestionable
proof of my being in full possession of his heart.</P>
<P>My appearance at Bath, without the company
of lord B—, occasioned a general surprize, and
encouraged the men to pester me with addresses;
every new admirer endeavouring to advance his
suit, by demonstrating the unkind and disrespect∣ful
behaviour of his lordship. Indeed, this was
the most effectual string they could touch: my
pride and resentment were alarmed, and I was
weak enough to listen to one man, who had like
to have insinuated himself into my inclinations.
He was tall and large boned, with white hair, in∣clining
to what is called sandy, and had the repu∣tation
of being handsome, tho' I think he scarce
deserved that epithet. He possessed a large for∣tune,
loved mischief, and stuck at nothing for the
accomplishment of his designs; one of his chief
pleasures, being that of setting any two lovers at
variance. He employed his address upon me with
great assiduity, and knew so well how to manage
my resentment, that I was pleased with his man∣ner,
heard his vows without disgust, and, in a
word, promised to deliberate with myself upon
his proposals, and give him an account of my
determination in writing.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="148"/>
Thus resolved, I went to lord B—, in Wilt∣shire,
whither I was followed by this pretender to
my heart, who visited us on the footing of an ac∣quaintance;
but when I reflected on what I had
done, I condemned my own conduct, as indis∣creet,
though nothing decisive had passed between
us, and began to hate him in proportion to the
self-conviction I felt; perceiving that I had in∣volved
myself in a difficulty from which I should
not be easily disengaged. For the present, how∣ever,
I found means to postpone my declaration;
he admitted my excuse, and I returned to Lon∣don
with lord B—, who was again summoned
to the field by his former challenger.</P>
<P>H—d—n, governor, counsellor, and steward
to this little hero, came to lord B—with a ver∣bal
message, importing, that his lordship had
changed his mind about going to Flanders, but
expected to meet him, on such a day and hour,
in the burying-ground near Red-lion-square.
Lord B—accepted the challenge, and gave me
an account of what had passed; but he had been
anticipated by the messenger, who had already
tried to alarm my fears, from the consideration of
the consequence, that I might take some measures
to prevent their meeting. But I perceived his
drift, and told him plainly that lord—had
no intention to risque his person, tho' he endea∣voured
with all his might to persuade me, that his
principal was desperate and determined. I knew
my little husband too well, to think he would
bring matters to any dangerous issue, and was ap∣prehensive
of nothing but soul play, from the vil∣lainy
of H—n, with which I was equally well
acquainted. Indeed I signified my doubts on that
score to Mr. H—, who would have attended
<PB N="144" REF="149"/>
his kinsman to the field, had he not thought he
might be liable to censure, if any thing should
happen to lord B—, because he himself was
heir at law: for that reason, he judiciously de∣clined
being personally concerned; and we pitched
upon the earl of A—, his lordship's uncle, who
willingly undertook the office.</P>
<P>At the appointed time they went to the place
of rendezvous, where they had not waited long
when the challenger appeared, in a new pink sa∣tin
waistcoat, which he had put on for the oc∣cassion,
with his sword under his arm, and his
steward by him, leaving, in an hackney coach,
at some distance, a surgeon whom he had pro∣vided
for the care of his person. Thus equipped,
he advanced to his antagonist, and desired him to
choose his ground; upon which lord B—told
him, that if he must fall, it was not material
which grave he should tumble over.</P>
<P>Our little hero finding him so jocose and de∣termined,
turned to lord A—, and desired to
speak with him, that he might disburden his con∣science
before they should begin the work of
death. They accordingly went aside; and he
gave him to understand, that his motive for
fighting was lord B—'s detaining his wife from
him, by compulsion. The earl of A—assured
him, he was egregiously mistaken in his con∣jecture;
that his nephew used no force or uncue
influence, to keep me in his house; but it could
not be expected that he would turn me out or
doors.</P>
<P>This explanation was altogether satisfactory
to lord—, who said he was far from being to
unreasonable as to expect lord B—would com∣mit
such a breach of hospitality; and all he de∣sired
<PB N="145" REF="150"/>
was, that his wife should be left to her own
inclinations. Upon these articles peace was con∣cluded,
and they parted without bloodshed. At least
these are the particulars of the story, as they were
related by lord A—, with whom I laugh'd
heartily at the adventure; for I never doubted
that the challenger would find some expedient to
prevent the duel, tho' I wondered how he mus∣tered
up resolution enough to carry it so far.</P>
<P>That he might not, however, give us any
more trouble, we resolved to go and enjoy our∣selves
in France, whither I went by myself, in
hopes of being soon joined by my lover, who was
obliged to stay some time longer in England, to
settle his affairs. He was so much affected at our
parting (tho' but for a few weeks) that he was
most distracted; and this affliction renewed my
renderness for him, because it was an undoubted
proof of his love. I wrote to him every post
from France; and, as I had no secrets, desired
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m to take care of all the letters that should
come to his house, directed to me, after my parture
from England.</P>
<P>This was an unfortunate office for him, in the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>cution of which he chanced to open a letter
from Sir T—A—, with whom (as I have al∣ready
observed) I had some correspondence at
Path. I had, according to my promise, given
the gentleman a decisive answer, importing, that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> determined to remain in my present situa∣tion,
but as lord B—was ignorant of my senti∣ments
in that particular, and perceived from the
better that something extraordinary had passed be∣tween
us, and that I was earnestly sollicited to
have him, he was seized with the utmost conster∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation
and concern; and having previously ob∣tained
<PB N="146" REF="151"/>
the king's leave to go abroad, set out that
very night for France, leaving his affairs in the
greatest confusion.</P>
<P>Sir T—A—hearing I was gone, without
understanding the cause of my departure, took
the same rout, and both arrived at Dover next
day. They heard of each other's motions:
each bribed the master of a packet-boat to trans∣port
him with expedition; but that depending
upon the wind, both reached Calais at the same
time, tho' in different vessels. Sir T—sent his
valet de chambre, post, with a letter, intreating
me to accompany him into Italy, where he
would make me mistress of his whole fortune, and
to set out directly for that country, that he might
not lose me by the arrival of lord B—, promising
to join me on the road, if I would consent to
make him happy. I sent his messenger back with
an answer, wherein I expressed surprize at his
proposals, after having signified my resolution to
him before I left England; and he was scarce
dismissed, when I received another letter from
lord B—, beseeching me to meet him at Cler∣mont,
upon the road from Calais; and conjuring
me to avoid the sight of his rival, should he get
the start of him in travelling. This, however,
was not likely to be the case, as lord B—rode
post, and the other was, by his corpulence,
obliged to travel in a chaise; yet, that I might
not increase his anxiety, I left Paris immediately
on the receit of his message, and met him at the
appointed place, where he received me with all
the agitation of joy and fear, and asked if I had
ever encouraged Sir T—A—in his addresses. I
very candidly told him the whole transaction, at
which he was incensed; but his indignation was
<PB N="147" REF="152"/>
soon appeased, when I professed my penitence,
and assured him, that I had totally rejected his
rival. Not that I approve of my behaviour to
Sir T—who (I own) was ill used in this affair;
but surely it was more excusable to halt here, than
proceed farther in my indiscretion.</P>
<P>My lover being satisfied with my declaration,
we went together to Paris, being attended by
the Scotchman whom I have already mentioned,
tho' I believe he was not over and above well
pleased to see matters thus amicably compro∣mised.
The furious knight followed us to the
capital; insisted upon seeing me in person; told
this North Briton, that I was actually engaged
to him; wrote every hour, and railed at my per∣sidious
conduct. I took no notice of these deli∣rious
transports, which were also disregarded by
lord B—, till one night he was exasperated by
the insinuations of Mr. C—, who, I believe, in∣flamed
his jealousy, by hinting a suspicion that I
was really in love with his rival. What passed
betwixt them I know not, but he sent for me
from the opera, by a physician of Paris, who was
a sort of go-between among us all, and who told
me, that if I did not come home on the instant,
a deal would be fought on my account.</P>
<P>I was very much shocked at this information;
but by being used to alarms from the behaviour
of lord—, I had acquired a pretty good share of
resolution, and with great composure entered the
room where lord B—was, with his companion,
whom I immediately ordered to withdraw. I
then gave his lordship to understand, that I was
unformed of what had passed, and thought my∣self
so much injured by the person who had just
<PB N="148" REF="153"/>
quitted the apartment, that I would no longer
live under the same roof with him.</P>
<P>Lord B—raved like a bedlamite, taxing me
with want of candour and affection; but I easily
justified my own integrity, and gave him such as∣surances
of my love, that his jealousy subsidee,
and his spirits were recomposed. Nevertheless
I insisted upon his dismissing Mr. C—, on pain
of my leaving the house, as I could not help
thinking he had used his endeavours to prejudice
me in the opinion of my lord. If his conduct
was the result of friendship for his patron, he
certainly acted the part of an honest and trusty
adherent. But I could not easily forgive him,
because, a few weeks before, he had, by my in∣terest,
obtained a considerable addition to his al∣lowance;
and even after the steps he had taken
to disoblige me, I was not so much his enemy
but that I prevailed upon lord B—to double his
salary, that his leaving the family might be no
detriment to his fortune.</P>
<P>His lordship having complied with my de∣mand,
this gentleman, after having stayed three
days in the house, to prepare for his departure,
during which I would not suffer him to be ad∣mitted
into my presence, made his retreat with a
fine young girl who was my companion; and I
have never seen him since that time.</P>
<P>Sir T—still continued furious, and would not
take a denial, except from my own mouth; up∣on
which, with the approbation of lord B—, I
indulged him with an interview. He entered
the apartment with a stern countenance, and told
me I had us'd him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll. I pleaded guilty to the
charge, and begg'd his pardon accordingly. I
attempted to reason the case with him, but he
<PB N="149" REF="154"/>
would hear no arguments except his own, and
even tried to intimidate me with threats; which
provoked me to such a degree, that I defied his
vengeance, telling him that I feared nothing but
the reproach of my own conscience; that tho' I
had acted a simple part, he durst not say there
was any thing criminal in my conduct; and
that, from his present frantic and unjust beha∣viour,
I thought myself happy in having escaped
him. He swore I was the most inflexible of all
creatures, asked if nothing would move me?
and when I answered, “Nothing,” took his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eave, and never afterwards persecuted me with
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> addresses; tho' I have heard he was vain and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> enough to boast of favours, which, upon my
honour, he never received, as he himself, at one
time, owned to doctor Cantwell at Paris.</P>
<P>While he underwent all this frenzy and di∣straction
upon my account, he was loved
with the same violence of passion by a certain
Scotch lady of quality, who, when he followed
me to France, pursued him thither with the
same eagerness and expedition; and, far from
being jealous of me as a rival, us'd to come to
my house, implore my good offices with the ob∣ject
of her love, and laying herself on the floor at
full length, before the fire, weep and cry like a
person <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erest of her senses. She bitterly com∣plained,
that he had never obliged her but once;
and begg'd, with the most earnest supplications,
that I would give her an opportunity of seeing
him at my house. But I thought proper to
avoid her company, as soon as I perceived her
intention.</P>
<P>We continued at Paris for some time, during
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I contracted an acquaintance with the
<PB N="150" REF="155"/>
sister of madam la T—. She was the supposed
mistress of the prince of C—, endowed with a
great share of understanding, and loved pleasure
to excess, tho' she maintained her reputation on
a respectable footing, by living with her husband
and mother. This lady, perceiving that I had
inspired her lover with a passion, which gave me
uneasiness on her account, actually practised all
her eloquence and art, in persuading me to listen
to his love; for it was a maxim with her, to
please him at any rate. I was shocked at her
indelicate complaisance, and rejected the propo∣sal,
as repugnant to my present engagement,
which I held as sacred as any nuptial tie, and
much more binding than a forced or unnatural
marriage.</P>
<P>Upon our return to England we lived in great
harmony and peace; and nothing was wanting to
my happiness, but the one thing to me most need∣ful;
I mean the inchanting tenderness and de∣lightful
enthusiasm of love. Lord B—'s heart (I
believe) felt the soft impressions; and, for my
own part, I loved him with the most faithful af∣fection.
It is not enough to say I wished him
well; I had the most delicate, the most genuine
esteem for his virtue, I had an intimate regard and
anxiety for his interest, and felt for him as if he
had been my own son: but still there was a va∣cancy
in my heart; there was not that fervour,
that transport, that ecstasy of passion which I had
formerly known; my bosom was not filled with
the little deity; I could not help recalling to my
remembrance the fond, the ravishing moments
had passed with S—; and had I understood the
conditions of life, those pleasures were happdy
exchanged for my present situation, because, if
<PB N="151" REF="156"/>
I was now deprived of those rapturous enjoy∣ments,
I was also exempted from the cares and
anxiety that attended them; but I was generally
extravagant in my notions of happiness, and
therefore construed my present tranquillity into
an insipid languor and stagnation of life.</P>
<P>While I remained in this inactivity of senti∣ment,
lord—having received a very consi∣derable
addition to his fortune, sent a message to
me, promising, that if I would leave lord B—,
he would make me a present of an house and
furniture, where I should live at my ease, with∣out
being exposed to his visits, except when I
should be disposed to receive them. This pro∣posal
he made, in consequence of what I had
always declared, namely, that if he had not re∣duced
me to the necessity of putting myself under
the protection of some person or other, by de∣priving
me of any other means of subsistence, I
should never have given the world the least cause
to scandalize my reputation; and that I would
withdraw myself from my present dependance,
as soon as he should enable me to live by myself.
I was therefore resolved to be as good as my
word, and accepted his offer, on condition that
I should be wholly at my own disposal, and that
he should never enter my door but as a visitant
or common friend.</P>
<P>These articles being sanctioned by his word
and honour (the value of which I did not then
know) an house was furnished according to my
directions; and I signified my intention to lord
B—, who consented to my removal, with this
pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>so, that I should continue to see him. I
wrote also to his relation Mr. B—, who, in his
answer, observed, that it was too late to advise
<PB N="152" REF="157"/>
when I was actually determined. All my friends
and acquaintance approved of the scheme, tho' it
was one of the most unjustifiable steps I had ever
taken, being a real act of ingratitude to my be∣nefactor;
which I soon did, and always shall re∣gret
and condemn. So little is the world quali∣fied
to judge of private affairs!</P>
<P>When the time of our parting drew near, lord
B—became gloomy and discontented, and even
intreated me to postpone my resolution; but I
told him, that now every thing was prepared for
my reception, I could not retract without in∣curring
the imputation of folly and extravagance.
On the very day of my departure Mr. B—en∣deavoured,
with all the arguments he could sug∣gest,
to dissuade me from my purpose; and I
made use of the same answer which had satisfied
his friend. Finding me determined upon re∣moving,
he burst out into a flood of tears, ex∣claiming,
“By G—d, if lord B—can bear
it, I can't.” I was thunderstruck at this ex∣pression;
for tho' I had been told that Mr. B—
was in love with me, I gave no credit to the re∣port,
because he had never declared his passion,
and this was the first hint of it that ever escaped
him in my hearing. I was therefore so much
amazed at the circumstance of this abrupt expla∣nation,
that I could make no answer; but hav∣ing
taken my leave, went away, ruminating on
the unforeseen event.</P>
<P>Lord B—(as I was informed) spoke not a
word that whole night, and took my leaving him
so much to heart, that two years clapsed before
he got the better of his grief. This intelligence
I afterwards received from his own mouth, and
asked his forgiveness for my unkind retreat, tho'
<PB N="153" REF="158"/>
I shall never be able to obtain my own. As for
Mr. B—, he was overwhelmed with sorrow, and
made such efforts to suppress his concern, as had
well nigh cost him his life. Dr. S—was called
to him in the middle of the night, and found him
almost suffocated. He soon guessed the cause,
when he understood that I had left the house:
so that I myself was the only person concerned
who was utterly ignorant of his affection; for I
solemnly declare he never gave me the least rea∣son
to suspect it while I lived with his relation,
because he had too much honour to entertain a
thought of supplanting his friend, and too good
an opinion of me to believe he should have suc∣ceeded
in the attempt. Tho' my love for lord B—
was not so tender and interesting as the passion I
had felt for S—, my fidelity was inviolable,
and I never harboured the most distant thought
of any other person, till after I had resolved to
leave him, when (I own) I afforded some small
encouragement to the addresses of a new admirer,
by telling him, that I should, in a little time, be
my own mistress, tho' I was not now at my own
disposal.</P>
<P>I enjoyed my new house as a little paradise:
it was accommodated with all sorts of conve∣niences;
every thing was new, and therefore
pleasing, and the whole absolutely at my com∣mand.
I had the company of a relation, a very
good woman, with whom I lived in the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> manner; was visited by the best people
in town. I mean these of the male sex, the la∣dies
having long ago forsaken me;) I frequented
all reputable places of publick entertainment, and
had a concert at home once a week: so that my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on in happiness and quiet, till all my
<PB N="154" REF="159"/>
sweets were imbittered by the vexatious behaviour
of my husband, who began to importune me
again to live with him; and by the increasing
anxiety of lord B—, who (tho' I still admitted
his visits) plainly perceived that I wanted to re∣linquish
his correspondence. This discovery
raised such tempests of jealousy and despair with∣in
his breast, that he kept me in continual
alarms: he sent messages to me every hour, sign∣ed
his letters with his own blood, raved like a
man in an ecstasy of madness, railed at my in∣gratitude,
and praised my conduct, by turns;
offered to sacrifice every thing for my love, to
leave the kingdom forthwith, and live with me
for ever in any part of the world where I should
choose to reside.</P>
<P>These were generous and tempting proposals;
but I was beset with counsellors who were not to∣tally
disinterested, and who dissuaded me from
embracing the proffers of my lover, on pretence
that lord—would be highly injured by my
compliance. I listened to their advice, and har∣dened
my heart against lord B—'s sorrow and so∣licitations.
My behaviour on this occasion is al∣together
unaccountable; this was the only time
that ever I was a slave to admonition. The con∣dition
of lord B—would have melted any heart
but mine, and yet mine was one of the most sen∣sible:
he employed his cousin as an advocate with
me, till that gentleman actually refused the office,
telling him candidly, that his own inclination,
were too much engaged, to permit him to per∣form
the task with fidelity and truth. He ac∣cordingly
resolved to avoid my presence, until my
lord and I should come to some final determina∣tion,
which was greatly retarded by the perseve∣rance
<PB N="155" REF="160"/>
of his lordship, who would not resign his
hopes even when I pretended that another man
had engaged my heart, but said, that in time my
affection might return.</P>
<P>Our correspondence, however, gradually wore
off; upon which Mr. B—renewed his visits, and
many agreeable and happy hours we passed toge∣ther.
Not that he, or any other person whom I
now saw, succeeded to the privilege of a fortu∣nate
lover: I knew he loved me to madness; but
I would not gratify his passion any other way than
by the most profound esteem and veneration for
his virtues, which were altogether amiable and
sublime; and I would here draw his character
minutely, but it wou'd take up too much time to
set forth his merits; the only man living of my
acquaintance who resembles him is lord F—, of
whom I shall speak in the sequel.</P>
<P>About this time, I underwent a very inter∣esting
change in the situation of my heart. I had
sent a message to my old lover S—, desiring he
would allow my picture, which was in his posses∣sion,
to be copied; and he now transmitted it to
me by my lawyer, whom he directed to ask, if I
intended to be at the next masquerade. This
curiosity had a strange effect upon my spirits;
my heart fluttered at the question, and my imagi∣nation
glowed with a thousand fond presages. I
answered in the affirmative, and we met by acci∣dent
at the ball. I could not behold him without
emotion; when he accosted me, his well-known
v<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce made my heart vibrate, like a musical chord,
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n its unison is struck. All the ideas of our
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t love, which the lapse of time and absence
had en<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eebled and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulled asleep, now awoke, and
were reinsp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red by his appearance; so that h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
<PB N="156" REF="161"/>
artful excuses were easily admitted: I forgave
him all that I had suffered on his account, because
he was the natural lord of my affection; and our
former correspondence was renewed.</P>
<P>I thought myself in a new world of bliss, in
consequence of this reconciliation, the raptures
of which continued unimpaired for the space of
four months, during which time he was fonder of
me, if possible, than before, repeated his promise of
marriage, if we should ever have it in our power;
assured me he had never been happy since he left
me; that he believed no woman had ever loved
like me: and indeed, to have a notion of my
passion for that man, you must first have loved as
I did: but, through a strange caprice, I broke
off the correspondence, out of apprehension that
he would forsake me again. From his past con∣duct,
I dreaded what might happen; and the re∣membrance
of what I had undergone by his in∣constancy,
filled my imagination with such hor∣ror,
that I could not endure the shocking prospect,
and prematurely plunged myself into the danger,
rather than endure the terrors of expectation. In
consequence of this desertion, I received a letter
from him, acknowledging that he was rightly serv∣ed,
but that it gave him inexpressible concern.</P>
<P>Mean while, lord—continued to act in
the character of a fiend, tormenting me with
his nauseous importunities: he prevailed upon
the duke of L—to employ his influence in
persuading me to live with him; assuring his
grace, that I had actually promised to give him
that proof of my obedience, and that I would
come home the sooner for being pressed to com∣pliance
by a person of his rank and character.
Induced by these representations, the duke ho∣noured
<PB N="157" REF="162"/>
me with a visit; and in the course of his
exhortations I understood how he had been thus
misinformed: upon which I sent for lord—,
and in his presence convicted him of the falshood,
by communicating to his grace the articles of our
last agreement, which he did not think proper to
deny; and the duke being undeceived, declared
that he would not have given me the trouble of
vindicating myself, had he not been misled by
the insincerity of my lord.</P>
<P>Baffled in this attempt, he engaged Mr. H—
V—, and afterwards my own father, in the same
task; and tho' I still adhered to my first resolu∣tion,
persisted with such obstinacy in his endea∣vours
to make me unhappy, that I determined to
leave the kingdom; and accordingly, after I
had spent the evening with him at Ranelagh, I
went away about two o'clock in the morning,
leaving my companion, with directions to re∣store
to my lord his house, furniture, plate, and
every thing he had given me since our last ac∣commodation;
so far was I, upon this occasion,
or at any other time of my life, from embezzling
any part of his fortune. My friend followed my
instructions most punctually; and his lordship
knows, and will acknowledge, the truth of this
assertion.</P>
<P>Thus have I explained the true cause of my
first expedition to Flanders, whither the world
was good-natured enough to say I followed Mr.
B—and the whole army, which happened to
besent abroad that summer. Before my departure
I likewise transmitted to lord B—the dressing∣place,
china, and a very considerable settlement,
of which he had been generous enough to make
me a present. This was an instance of my in∣tegrity,
<PB N="158" REF="163"/>
which I thought due to a man who had
laid me under great obligations; and tho' I have
lived to be refused a small sum both by him and
S—, I do not repent of my disinterested beha∣viour;
and all the revenge I harbour against the
last of these lovers, is the desire of having it in
my power to do him good.</P>
<P>I now found myself adrift in the world again,
and very richly deserved the hardships of my con∣dition,
for my indiscretion in leaving lord B—,
and in trusting to the word of lord—, with∣out
some farther security; but I have dearly paid
for my imprudence. The more I saw into the
character of this man whom destiny hath ap∣pointed
my scourge, the more was I determined
to avoid his fellowship and communication; for
he and I are, in point of disposition, as opposite
as any two principles in nature. In the first place,
he is one of the most unsocial beings that ever
existed; when I was pleased and happy he was
always out of temper, but if he could find means
to overcast and cloud my mirth, tho' never so
innocent, he then discovered the signs of un∣common
satisfaction and content, because, by
this disagreeable temper, he banished all com∣pany
from his house. He is extremely weak of
understanding, tho' he possesses a good share of
low cunning, which has so egregiously imposed
upon some people, that they have actually be∣lieved
him a good-natured easy creature, and
blamed me because I did not manage him to bet∣ter
purpose; but, upon further acquaintance,
they have always found him obstinate as a mule,
and capricious as a monkey. Not that he is ut∣terly
void of all commendable qualities: he is
punctual in paying his debts, liberal when in
<PB N="159" REF="164"/>
good humour, and would be well bred, were he
not subject to fits of absence, during which he is
altogether unconversable; but he is proud, natu∣rally
suspicious, jealous, equally with and with∣out
cause, never made a friend, and is an utter
stranger to the joys of intimacy; in short, he
hangs like a damp upon society, and may be pro∣perly
called <HI>Kill-joy,</HI> an epithet which he has
justly acquired. He honours me with constant
professions of love, but his conduct is so opposite
to my sentiments of that passion, as to have been
the prime source of all my misfortunes and af∣fliction;
and I have often wished myself the
object of his hate, in hopes of profiting by a
change in his behaviour.</P>
<P>Indeed, he has not been able to make me more
unhappy than, I believe, he is in his own mind;
for he is literally a self-tormentor, who never
enjoyed one gleam of satisfaction, except at the
expence of another's quiet; and yet with this (I
had almost called it diabolical) quality, he ex∣pects
that I should cherish him with all the ten∣derness
of affection; and after he has been at
pains to incur my aversion, punishes my disgust,
by contriving schemes to mortify and perplex
me, which have often succeeded so effectually,
as to endanger my life and constitution; for I
have been fretted and frighted into sundry fits of
illness, and then I own I have experienced his
care and concern.</P>
<P>Over and above the oddities I have mentioned,
he is so unsteady in his oeconomy, that he is al∣ways
new modelling his affairs, and exhausting
his fortune, by laying out ten pounds, in order to
save a shilling; he inquires into the character of a
servant after he has lived two years in his family,
<PB N="160" REF="165"/>
and is so ridiculously stocked with vanity and self∣conceit,
that notwithstanding my assurance be∣fore,
and the whole series of my conduct since
our marriage, which ought to have convinced
him of my dislike, he is still persuaded, that at
bottom, I must admire and be enamoured of his
agreeable person and accomplishments, and that
I would not fail to manifest my love, were I not
spirited up against him by his own relations.
Perhaps it might be their interest to foment the
misunderstanding betwixt us; but really, they
give themselves no trouble about our affairs;
and, so far as I know them, are a very good
sort of people. On the whole, I think I may
with justice pronounce my precious yoke-fellow a
trifling, teazing, insufferable, inconsistent creature.</P>
<P>With the little money which remained of what
I had received from his lordship, for housekeep∣ing,
I transported myself to Flanders, and ar∣rived
in Ghent, a few days after our troops were
quartered in that city, which was so much
crowded with these new visitants, that I should
have found it impracticable to procure a lodging,
had I not been accommodated by lord R—B—,
the duke of A—'s youngest brother, who very
politely gave me up his own. Here I saw my
friend Mr. B—, who was overjoyed at my
arrival, though jealous of every man of his ac∣quaintance;
for he loved me with all the ardour
of passion, and I regarded him with all the per∣fection
of friendship, which, had he lived, in time
might have produced love; but it never did. Not∣withstanding
his earnest solicitations to the con∣trary,
I stayed but a week in Ghent, from whence
I proceeded to Brussels, and fixed my abode in
the Hotel de Flandre, among an agreeable set of
<PB N="161" REF="166"/>
gentlemen and ladies, with whom I spent my
time very chearfully. There being a sort of
court in this city, it was frequented by all the
officers, who could obtain permission to go thi∣ther;
and the place in general was gay and agree∣able.
I was introduced to the best families, and
very happy in my acquaintance; for the ladies
were polite, good tempered, and obliging, and
treated me with the utmost hospitality and re∣spect.
Among others, I contracted a friendship
with Madam la comtesse de C—, and her
two daughters, who were very amiable young la∣dies;
and became intimate with the princess
C—and countess W—, lady of the bed∣chamber
to the queen of Hungary, and a great
favourite of the governor Monsieur D'H—,
in whose house she lived with his wife, who was
also a lady of a very engaging disposition.</P>
<P>Soon after I had fixed my habitation in Brus∣sels,
the company at our Hotel was increased by
three officers, who professed themselves my ad∣mirers,
and came from Ghent, with a view of
soliciting my love. This triumvirate consisted
of the Scotch earl of—, lord R—M—, and
another young officer: the first was a man of a
very genteel figure and amorous complexion,
danced well, and had a great deal of good hu∣mour,
with a mixture of vanity and self-conceit.
The second had a good face, though a clumsy
person, and a very sweet disposition, very much
adapted for the sentimental passion of love: and
the third (Mr. W—by name) was tall, thin,
and well-bred, with a great stock of good na∣ture
and vivacity. These adventurers began their
addresses in general acts of gallantry, that com∣prehended
several of my female friends, with
<PB N="162" REF="167"/>
whom we used to engage in parties of pleasure,
both in the city and the <HI>environs,</HI> which are ex∣tremely
agreeable; and when they thought they
had taken the preliminary steps of securing them∣selves
in my good opinion and esteem, they
agreed to go on without farther delay, and that
lord—should make the first attack upon my
heart.</P>
<P>He accordingly laid siege to me, with such
warmth and assiduity, that I believe he deceived
himself, and began to think he was actually in
love; though at bottom, he felt no impulse that
deserved the sacred name. Though I discou∣raged
him in the beginning, he persecuted me
with his addresses; he always sat by me at din∣ner,
and imparted a thousand trifles in continual
whispers, which attracted the notice of the com∣pany
so much, that I began to fear his behaviour
would give rise to some report to my prejudice;
and therefore avoided him with the utmost cau∣tion.
Notwithstanding all my care, however,
he found means one night, while my maid, who
lay in my room, went down stairs, to get into
my chamber after I was abed: upon which, I
started up, and told him, that if he should ap∣proach
me, I would alarm the house; for I never
wanted courage and resolution. Perceiving my
displeasure, he kneeled by the bed-side, begg'd I
would have pity on his sufferings, and swore I
should have <HI>carte blanche</HI> to the utmost extent of
his fortune. To these proposals I made no other
reply, but that of protesting I would never speak
to him again, if he did not quit my apartment
that moment; upon which, he thought proper
to withdraw; and I never afterwards gave him
an opportunity of speaking to me on the same
<PB N="163" REF="168"/>
subject: so that, in a few weeks, he separated
himself from our society; though the ladies of
Brussels considered him as my lover, because, of
all the other officers, he was their greatest fa∣vourite.</P>
<P>His lordship being thus repulsed, Mr. W—
took the field, and assailed my heart in a very
different manner. He said, he knew not how
to make love, but was a man of honour, would
keep the secret, and so forth. To this cavalier
address I answered, that I was not angry, as I
otherwise should have been at his blunt declara∣tion,
because I found, by his own confession, he
did not know what was due to the sex; and my
unhappy situation in some shape excused him for
a liberty, which he would not have dream'd of
taking, had not my misfortunes encouraged his
presumption. But I would deal with him in
his own way; and far from assuming the prude,
frankly assured him, that he was not at all to my
taste, hoping he would consider my dislike as a
sufficient reason to reject his love.</P>
<P>Lord R—began to feel the symptoms of a
genuine passion, which he carefully cherished in
silence, being naturally diffident and bashful;
but, by the very means he used to conceal it from
my observation, I plainly discerned the situation
of his heart, and was not at all displeased at the
progress I had made in his inclinations. Mean
while, he cultivated my acquaintance with great
assiduity and respect, attended me in all my ex∣cursions,
and particularly in an expedition to
An<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>werp, with two other gentlemen, where, in
downright <HI>gaietè de coeur,</HI> we sat for our pic∣tures,
which were drawn in one piece; one of the
partie being represented in the dress of an hussar,
<PB N="164" REF="169"/>
and another in that of a running footman. This
incident I mention, because the performance,
which is now in my possession, gave birth to a
thousand groundless reports, that circulated in
England at our expence.</P>
<P>It was immediately after this jaunt, that lord
R—began to disclose his passion; though he,
at the same time, started such objections as
seemed well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igh to extinguish his hopes, la∣menting,
that even if he should have the hap∣piness
to engage my affections, his fortune was
too inconsiderable to support us against the efforts
of lord—, should he attempt to interrupt our
felicity; and that he himself was obliged to fol∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w
the motions of the army. In short, he
seemed to consider my felicity more than his
own, and behaved with such delicacy, as gra∣dually
made an impression on my heart; so
that when we parted, we agreed to renew our
correspondence in England.</P>
<P>In the midst of these agreeable amusements,
which I enjoyed in almost all the different towns
of Flanders, I happened to be at Ghent one day,
sitting among a good deal of company, in one of
their Hotels, when a post-chaise stopped at the
gate; upon which we went to the windows to
satisfy our curiosity, when who should step out
of the convenience, but my little insignificant
lord. I no sooner announced him to the company,
than all the gentlemen asked whether they should
stay and protect me, or withdraw; and when I
assured them, that their protection was not ne∣cessary,
one and all of them retired; though lord
R—M—went no farther than the par∣lour
below, being determined to screen me
against all violence and compulsion. I sent a
<PB N="165" REF="170"/>
message to my lord, desiring him to walk up into
my apartment; but although his sole errand was
to see and carry me off, he would not venture to
accept of my invitation, till he had demanded me
in form, from the governor of the place.</P>
<P>That gentleman being altogether a stranger to
his person and character, referred him to the
commanding officer of the English troops, who
was a man of humour, and upon his lordship's
application, pretended to doubt his identity; ob∣serving,
that he had always heard lord—re∣presented
as a jolly corpulent man. He gave
him to understand, however, that even granting,
him to be the person, I was by no means subject
to military law, unless he could prove, that I had
ever inlisted in his majesty's service.</P>
<P>Thus disappointed in his endeavours, he re∣turned
to the inn, and, with much persuasion,
trusted himself in my dining-room, after having
stationed his attendant at the door, in case of ac∣cidents.
When I asked, what had procured me
the honour of this visit; he told me, his business
and intention were to carry me home; and this
declaration produced a conference, in which I
argued the case with him; and matters were ac∣commodated
for the present, by my promising to
be in England some time in September, on con∣dition
that he would permit me to live by my∣self,
as before, and immediately order the arrears
of my pin-money to be paid. He assented to
every thing I proposed, returned in peace to his
own country, and the deficiencies of my allow∣ance
were made good; while I returned to Brus∣sels,
where I stayed until my departure for Eng∣land,
which I regulated in such a manner as was
consistent with my engagement.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="171"/>
I took lodgings in Pall-mall, and sending for
my lord, convinced him of my punctuality, and
put him in mind of his promise; when, to my
utter astonishment and confusion, he owned, that
his promise was no more than a decoy to bring
me over, and that I must lay my account with
living in his house, like a dutiful and obedient
wife. I heard him with the indignation such
treatment deserved, upbraided him with his per∣fidious
dealing, which I told him would have de∣termined
me against cohabitation with him, had
I not been already resolved: and being destitute
of all resource, repaired to Bath, where I after∣wards
met with Mr. D—and Mr. R—,
two gentlemen who had been my fellow-passen∣gers
in the yacht from Flanders, and treated me
with great friendship and politeness, without ei∣ther
talking or thinking of love.</P>
<P>With these gentlemen, who were as idle as
myself, I went to the jubilee at Preston, which
was no other than a great number of people as∣sembled
in a small town extremely ill accommo∣dated,
to partake of diversions that were bad
imitations of plays, concerts, and masquerades.
If the world should place to the account of my
indiscretion, my travelling in this manner, with
gentlemen to whom I had no particular attach∣ment;
let it also be considered, as an alleviation,
that I always lived in terror of my lord, and con∣sequently
was often obliged to shift my quarters;
so that my finances being extremely slender, I
stood the more in need of assistance and protec∣tion.
I was, besides, young, inconsiderate, and
so simple, as to suppose the figure of an ugly
man would always secure me from censure on
his account: neither did I ever dream of any
<PB N="167" REF="172"/>
man's addresses, until he made an actual declara∣tion
of his love.</P>
<P>Upon my return to Bath, I was again har∣rassed
by lord—, who came thither accom∣panied
by my father, whom I was very glad to
see, though he importuned me to comply with
my husband's desire, and for the future keep
measures with the world. This remonstrance
about living with my lord, which he constantly
repeated, was the only instance of his unkindness
which I ever felt. But all his admonitions were
not of force sufficient to shake my resolution in
that particular; though the debate continued so
late, that I told his lordship, it was high time to
retire, for I could not accommodate him with a
bed. He then gave me to understand, that he
would stay where he was; upon which my fa∣ther
took his leave, on pretence of looking out
for a lodging to himself.</P>
<P>The little gentleman being now left <HI>tête a téte</HI>
with me, began to discover some signs of appre∣hension
in his looks; but mustering up all his re∣solution,
he went to the door, called up three of
his servants, whom he placed as centinels upon
the stair, and flung himself in my elbow-chair,
where he resigned himself to rest. Intending to
go to bed, I thought it was but just and decent
that I should screen myself from the intrusion of
his footmen, and with that view bolted the door.
Lord—hearing himself locked in, started up
in the utmost terror and consternation, kicked
the door with his heel, and screamed aloud, as if
he had been in the hands of an assassin. My fa∣ther,
who had not yet quitted the house, hearing
these outcries, ran up stairs again, and coming
through my bed-chamber, into the dining-room
<PB N="168" REF="173"/>
where we were, found me almost suffocated with
laughter, and his heroic son-in-law staring like
one who had lost his wits, with his hair standing
on end.</P>
<P>When my father asked the meaning of his
exclamations, he told him with all the symptoms
of dismay, that I had lock'd him in, and he did
not understand such usage: but I explained the
whole mystery, by saying, I had bolted the door,
because I did not like the company of his ser∣vants,
and could not imagine the cause of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, unless he thought I designed to ravish
him; an insult, than which nothing was farther
from my intention. My father himself could
scarce refrain from laughing at his ridiculous fear;
but seeing him in great confusion, took pity on
his condition, and carried him off to his own
lodgings, after I had given my word, that I
would not attempt to escape, but give him au∣dience
next morning. I accordingly kept my
promise, and found means to persuade them to
leave me at my own discretion. Next day, I
was ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed upon the stratagem I had contrived to
frighten lord—; and a thousand idle stories
were told about this adventure, which happened
literally as I have related it.</P>
<P>From Bath I betook myself to a small house
near Lincoln, which I hired of the d—of
A—, because a country life suited best with
my income, which was no more than four hun∣dred
pounds a year, and that not well paid.
I continued some months in this retirement, and
sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no company, except lord R—M—,
who lived in the neighbourhood, and visited me
twice; till finding myself indisposed, I was ob∣l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged
to remove to London, and took lodgings
<PB N="169" REF="174"/>
in Maddox-street, where my garison was taken
by storm, by my lord and his steward, rein∣forced
by Mr. L—V—, (who, as my lord
told me, had a subsidy of five and twenty pounds,
before he would take the field) and a couple of
hardy footmen. This formidable band rushed
into my apartment, laid violent hands upon me,
dragged me down stairs, without gloves or a
cloak, and thrusting me into a coach that stood
at the door, conveyed me to my lord's lodgings
in Gloucester-street.</P>
<P>Upon this occasion, his lordship courageously
drew his sword upon my woman, who attempted
to defend me from his insults, and, in all proba∣bility,
would have intimidated him from pro∣ceeding;
for he looked pale and aghast, his knees
knocked together, and he breathed thick and
hard, with his nostrils dilated, as if he had seen
a ghost. But he was encouraged by his merce∣nary
associate, who, for the five and twenty
pounds, stood by him in the day of trouble, and
spirited him on to this gallant enterprize.</P>
<P>In consequence of this exploit, I was cooped
up in a paultry apartment in Gloucester-street,
where I was close beset by his lordship, and his
worthy steward Mr. H—, with a set of ser∣vants
that were the creatures of this fellow, of
whom lord—himself stood in awe; so that
I could not help thinking myself in Newgate,
among thieves and ruffians: and to such a degree
did my terror prevail, that I actually believed I
was in danger of being poisoned, and would not
receive any sustenance, except from the hands of
one harmless-looking fellow, a foreigner, who
was my lord's valet de chambre. I will not pre∣tend
to say my fears were just; but such was my
<PB N="170" REF="175"/>
opinion of H—n, that I never doubted he would
put me out of the way, if he thought my life in∣terfered
with his interest.</P>
<P>On the second day of my imprisonment, I was
visited by the duke of L—, a friend of my
lord, who found me sitting upon a trunk, in a poor
little dining-room filled with lumber, and lighted
with two bits of tallow-candle, which had been
left over night. He perceived in my counte∣nance
a mixture of rage, indignation, terror and
despair: he compassionated my sufferings, though
he could not alleviate my distress, any other way
than by interceding with my tyrant to mitigate my
oppression. Nevertheless, I remained eleven days
in this comfortable situation: I was watched like
a criminal all day, and one of the servants
walked from one room to another all night, in
the nature of a patrole; while my lord, who lay
in the chamber above me, got out of bed, and
tripp'd to the window, at the sound of every
coach that chanced to pass through the street.
H—n, who was consummate in the arts of a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cophant, began to court my favour, by con∣doling
my affliction, and assuring me, that the
only method by which I could regain my liberty,
was a chearful compliance with the humour of
my lord. I was fully convinced of the truth of
this observation; and though my temper is alto∣gether
averse to dissimulation, attempted to affect
an air of serenity and resignation. But this dis∣guise,
I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, would not answer my purpose; and
therefore I had recourse to the assistance of my
maid, who was permitted to attend me in my
confinement. With her I frequently consulted
about the means of accomplishing my escape;
and, in consequence of our deliberations, she di∣rected
<PB N="171" REF="176"/>
a coach and fix to be ready at a certain
part of the town, and to wait for me three days
in the same place, in case I could not come before
the expiration of that term.</P>
<P>This previous measure being taken according
to my instructions, the next necessary step was to
elude the vigilance of my guard: and in this
manner did I effectuate my purpose. Being, by
this time, indulged in the liberty of going out
in the coach, for the benefit of the air, attended
by two footmen, who had orders to watch all my
motions, I made use of this privilege one fore∣noon,
when lord—expected some company
to dinner, and bad the coachman drive to the
lodgings of a man who wrote with his mouth,
intending to give my spies the slip, on pretence
of seeing this curiosity: but they were too alert
in their duty to be thus outwitted, and followed
me up stairs into the very apartment.</P>
<P>Disappointed in this hope, I revolved another
scheme, which was attended with success: I
bought some olives at an oil-shop; and telling the
servants I would proceed to St. James's gate, and
take a turn in the park, broke one of the bottles
by the way, complained of the misfortune when
I was set down, and desired that my coach might
be cleaned before my return. While my atten∣dants
were employed in this office, I tripp'd
across the parade to the horse-guards, and chanced
to meet with an acquaintance in the park, who
said, he saw by my countenance, that I was up∣on
some expedition. I owned his supposition was
just; but, as I had not time to relate particulars,
I quickened my pace, and took possession of a
hackney-coach, in which I proceeded to the ve∣hicle
which I had appointed to be in waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="177"/>
While I thus compassed my escape, there was
nothing but perplexity and confusion at home;
dinner was delayed till six o'clock; my lord ran
half over the town in quest of his equipage,
which at last returned, with an account of my
elopement. My maid was brought to the que∣stion,
and grievously threatened; but (like all
the women I ever had) remained unshaken in her
fidelity. In the mean time, I travelled night and
day towards my retreat in Lincolnshire, of which
his lordship had not, as yet, got the least intelli∣gence;
and as my coachman was but an unex∣perienced
driver, I was obliged to make use of
my own skill in that exercise, and direct his en∣deavours
the whole way, without venturing to
go to bed, or take the least repose, until I reached
my own habitation, where I lived in peace and
tranquillity for the space of six weeks, when I
was alarmed by one of my lord's myrmidons,
who came into the neighbourhood, blustering
and swcaing, that he would carry me off, e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er
dead or alive.</P>
<P>It is not to be supposed that I was perfectly
easy, when I was made acquainted with his pur∣pose
and declaration, as my whole family <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of no more th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n a couple of women and one
footman. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> summoned up my cou∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e,
which had been often tried, and never f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ook
me in the day of danger; and sent him
word, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t if <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er he should presume to approach
my hous<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, I would order <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be shot, without
cer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mony. The fellow did not choose to put me
to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and returned to town without his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. But as th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place of my above was new
discovered, I <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my account w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th having a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
from his employer: I therefore planted spies upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> road, with a promise of reward to him who
should bring me the first intelligence of his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dship's approach.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I was one morning apprized of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> coming; and mounting horse immediately,
with my woman and valet, away we rode, in
defiance of winter, and in two days got through
the wilds of Lincolnshire and hundreds of Essex,
crossed the river at Tilbury, breakfasted at Chat∣ham,
by the help of a guide and moon-light, ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ved
at Dover the same evening, and embarked
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is, in which place I found myself next day
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> two o'clock in the afternoon; and being hear∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
tired with my journey, betook myself to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. My maid, who was not able to travel with
such expedition, followed me at an easier pace;
and the footman was so astonished at my perse∣verance,
that he could not help asking upon the
road, if ever I was weary in my life. Certain it
is, my spirits and resolution have enabled me to
undergo fatigues that are almost incredible. From
Calais I went to Brussels, where I again set up
my <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est in private lodgings; was again per∣fectly
well received by the fashionable people of
that place; and, by the interest of my friends,
obtained the queen of Hungary's protection against
the persecution of my husband, while I should re∣side
in the Austrian Netherlands.</P>
<P>Thus secured, I lived uncensured, conversing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the English company, with which this city
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but spent the most agreeable part
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my time with the countess of Calemberg, in
whose house I generally dined and supped; and I
also contracted an intimacy with the princess of
Chemay, who was a great favourite with Madam
D'H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arach, the governor's lady.</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="179"/>
I had not been long in this happy situation,
when I was disturbed by the arrival of lord—,
who demanded me of the governor; but finding
me sheltered from his power, he set out for Vi∣enna;
and, in consequence of his representations,
strengthened with the duke of N—'s name, my
protection was withdrawn. But, before this ap∣plication,
he had gone to the camp, and addressed
himself to my lord Stair, who was my parti∣cular
friend, and ally by my first marriage, de∣siring
he would compel me to return to his house,
His lordship told him, that I was in no shape sub∣ject
to his command; but invited him to dinner,
with a view of diverting himself and company, at
the expence of his guest. In the evening, he
was plied with so many bumpers to my health,
that he became intoxicated, and extremely ob∣streperous,
insisted upon seeing lord Stair, after
he was retired to rest, and quarrelled with lord
D—, who being a tall, large, raw-boned
Scotchman, could have swallowed him at one
mouthful; but he thought he might venture to
challenge him, in hopes of being put under ar∣rest
by the general: though he reckoned without
his host; lord Stair knew his dispo∣sition, and,
in order to punish his presumption, winked at the
affair. The challenger, finding himself mistaken
in his conjecture, got up early in the morning,
and went off post for Vienna: and lord Stair de∣sired
a certain man of quality to make me a visit,
and give me an account of his behaviour.</P>
<P>Being now deprived of my protection and p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣money,
which my generous husband would no long∣er
pay, I was reduced to great difficulty and distress.
The duchess D'Aremberg, lord G—, and many
other persons of distinction, interceded in my be∣half
<PB N="175" REF="180"/>
with his majesty, who was then abroad;
but he refused to interpose between man and
wife. The countess of Calemberg wrote a letter to
my father, in which she represented my uncom∣fortable
situation, and undertook to answer for
my conduct, in case he would allow me a small
annuity, on which I could live independant of
lord—, who, by all accounts, was a wretch
with whom I could never enjoy the least happi∣ness
or quiet; otherwise, she would be the first to
advise me to an accommodation. She gave him
to understand, that her character was neither
doubtful nor obscure; and that if my conduct
there had not been irreproachable, she should not
have taken me under her protection: that as I
proposed to board in a convent, a small sum
would answer my occasions; but, if that should
be denied, I would actually go to service, or take
some other desperate step, to avoid the man who
was my bane and aversion.</P>
<P>To this kind remonstrance my father answer∣ed,
that his fortune would not allow him to assist
me; he had now a young family; and that I
ought, at all events, to return to my husband.
By this time, such was the extremity of my cir∣cumstances,
that I was forced to pawn my
cloaths, and every trifling trinket in my posses∣sion,
and even to descend so far as to sollicit Mr.
S—for a loan of fifty pounds, which he refused.</P>
<P>Thus was I deserted, in my distress, by two
persons, to whom, in the season of my affluence,
my purse had been always open. Nothing so
effectually subdues a spirit unused to supplicate, as
want: repulsed in this manner, I had recourse to
lord B—, who was also (it seems) unable to relieve
<PB N="176" REF="181"/>
my necessities. This mortification I deserved at
his hands, tho' he had once put it in my power
to be above all such paultry demands; and I
should not have been compelled to the disagree∣able
task of troubling my friends, had not I vo∣luntarily
resigned what he formerly gave me.
As to the other gentleman to whom I addressed
myself, on this occasion, I think he might have
shewn more regard to my application, not only
for the reasons already mentioned, but because
he knew me too well to be ignorant of what I
must have suffered, in condescending to make
such a request.</P>
<P>Several officers, who guess'd my adversity,
generously offered to supply me with money; but
I could not bring myself to make use of their
friendship, or even to own my distress, except
to one person, of whom I borrowed a small s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m.
To crown my misfortunes, I was taken very
ill, at a time when there was no other way of
avoiding the clutches of my persecutor, but by a
precipitate flight. In this emergency, I appl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
to a worthy gentleman of Brussels, a very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
friend of mine, but no lover. I say no <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
because every man is supposed to act in that c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣city
who befriends a young woman in <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
This generous Fleming set out with me, in the
night, from Brussels, and conducted me to the
frontiers of France. Being very much indisposed
both in mind and body when I was obliged to
undertake this expedition, I should, in all proba∣bility,
have sunk under the fitigue of travelling,
had not my spirits been kept up by the conversa∣tion
of my companion, who was a man of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
and consequence, and undertook to manage
<PB N="177" REF="182"/>
my affairs in such a manner as would enable me
to re establish my residence in the place I had
left. He was young and active, attended me
with the utmost care and assiduity, and left no∣thing
undone which he thought would contribute
to my ease and satisfaction. I believe his friend∣ship
for me was a little tinctured with another
passion; but he was married, and lived very well
with his wife, who was also my friend; so that
he k<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew I would never think of him in the light
of a lover.</P>
<P>Upon our arrival at Valenciennes, he accom∣modated
me with a little money (for a little was
all I would take) and returned to his own city,
after we had settled a correspondence by letters.
I was detained a day or two in this place by my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd sposition, which increased; but nevertheless
proceeded to Paris, to make interest for a pro∣tection
from the king of France, which that
monarch graciously accorded me, in three days
after my first application; and his minister sent
orders to all the governors and intendants of the
province towns, to protect me against the efforts
of lord—, in whatever place I should choose
to reside.</P>
<P>Having returned my thanks at Versailles for
this favour, and tarried a few days at Paris,
which was a place altogether unsuitable to the
low ebb of my fortune, I repaired to Lisle, where
I intended to fix my habitation; and there my
disorder recurred with such violence, that I was
obl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ged to send for a physician, who seemed to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> been a disciple of Sangrado; for he scarce
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> drop of blood in my body, and yet I found
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Indeed I was so
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> exhausted by these <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and my
<PB N="178" REF="183"/>
constitution so much impaired by fatigue and per∣turbation
of mind, that I had no other hope of
recovering but that of reaching England, and
putting myself under the direction of a physician
on whose ability I could depend.</P>
<P>With this doubtful prospect, therefore, I de∣termined
to attempt a return to my native air,
and actually departed from Lisle, in such a me∣lancholy
enfeebled condition, that I had almost
fainted when I was put into the coach. But be∣fore
I resolved upon this journey I was reduced
to the utmost exigence of fortune; so that I
could scarce afford to buy provisions, had it been
in my power to eat, and should not have been
able to defray my travelling expences, had I not
been generously befriended by lord R—M—
who (I am sure) would have done any thing for
my ease and accommodation, tho' he has un∣justly
incurred the imputation of being parsimo∣nious,
and I had no reason to expect any such
favour at his hands.</P>
<P>In this deplorable state of health I was convey∣ed
to Calais, being all the way (as it were) in
the arms of death, without having swallowed the
least sustenance on the road; and so much was
my indisposition augmented by the fatigue of the
journey, that I swooned when I was brought in∣to
the inn, and had almost expired before I could
receive the least assistance or advice: however,
my spirits were a little revived by some bread and
wine, which I took at the persuasion of a French
surgeon, who chancing to pass by the door, was
called up to my relief; and having sent my ser∣vant
to Brussels to take care of my cloaths, em∣barked
in the packet-boat, and by that time we
arrived at Dover, was almost in extremity.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="184"/>
Here I found a return coach, in which I was
carried to London, and was put to bed in the house
at which we put up, more dead than alive. The
people of the inn sent for an apothecary, who ad∣ministred
some cordial that recalled me to life;
and when I recovered the use of speech, I told
I am who I was, and desired him to wait upon
Dr. S—and inform him of my situation. A
young girl who was niece to the landlord's wife,
seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e unattended, made a tender of her ser∣vice
to me, and I accepted the offer, as well as
a lodging in the apothecary's house, to which
I was conveyed as soon as my strength would ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t
of my removal; and there was visited by my
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>cian, who was shocked to find me in such a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> condition: however, having considered
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, he perceived that my indisposition <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
from the calamities I had undergone,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> encouraged me with the hope of a speedy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, provided I could be kept easy and undis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</P>
<P>I was accordingly tended with all imaginable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> my lord's name being never mentioned in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earing, because I considered him as the fatal

to persuade me, that it would be my

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he had often occasion to see. But I
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, commenced a new <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
and took a small house in St.
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Square.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at this time, my woman retumed from
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but without my cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, which were
<PB N="180" REF="185"/>
detained on account of the money I owed in that
place; and asking her dismission from m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> service,
set up shop for herself. I had not lived many
weeks in my new habitation, when my persecutor
renewed his attempts to make himself master of
my person; but I had learn'd from experience,
to redouble my vigilance, and he was frustrated
in all his endeavours. I was again happy in the
conversation of my former acquaintance, and vi∣sited
by a great number of gentlemen, most∣ly
persons of probity and sense, who culti∣vated
my friendship, without any other motive
of attachment. Not that I was unsolicited on
the article of love; that was a theme on which I
never wanted orators; and could I have pre∣vailed
upon myself to profit by the advances that
were made, I might have managed my opportu∣nities,
so as to have set fortune at defiance for the
future. But I was none of those oeconomists,
who can sacrifice their hearts to interested con∣siderations.</P>
<P>One evening, while I was conversing with
three or four of my friends, my lawyer came in,
and told me he had something of consequence to
impart: upon which, all the gentlemen but one
went away; and he gave me to understand, that
my suit would immediately come to trial; and
though he hoped the best, the issue was uncer∣tain:
that if it should be given against me, the
decision would inspire my lord with fresh spirits
to disturb my peace; and therefore it would be
convenient for me to retire, until the affair should
be brought to a determination.</P>
<P>I was very much disconcerted at this inte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣gence;
and the gentleman who stayed percei<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>,
my concern, as<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed what I intended to so, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="181" REF="186"/>
he could serve me in any shape, and desired to
know whither I proposed to retreat. I affected
to laugh, and answered, “To a garret I be∣lieve.”
To this over-strained raillery he replied,
that if I should, his friendship and regard would
find the way to my apartment; and I had no
reason to doubt the sincerity of his declaration.
We consulted about the measures I should take,
and I determined to remove into the country,
where I was soon favoured with a letter from
him, wherein he expressed the infinite pleasure
he had, in being able to assure me, that my suit
had been successful, and that I might appear again
with great safety.</P>
<P>Accordingly, I returned to town in his coach
and six, which he had sent for my convenience,
and the same evening went with him to the masque∣ra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,
where we passed the night very agreeably,
his spirits, as well as mine, being elevated to a
joyous pitch, by the happy event of my process.
This gentleman was a person of great honour,
wroth and good nature; he loved me extremely,
but did not care that I should know the extent of
his passion: on the contrary, he endeavoured to
persuade me, he had laid it down as a maxim,
that no woman should ever have power enough
over his heart, to give him the least pain or dis∣quiet.
In short, he had made a progress in my
affection, and to his generosity was I indebted
for my subsistence two whole years; during
which, he was continually professing this philo∣sophic
indifference, while, at the same time, he
was giving me daily assurances of his friendship
and esteem, and treating me with incessant marks
of the most passionate love: so that I concluded
<PB N="182" REF="187"/>
his intention was cold, though his temper was
warm; and considering myself as an incumbrance
upon his fortune, I redoubled my endeavours to
obtain a separate maintenance from my lord, and
removed from St. James's Square to lodgings at
Kensington, where I had not long enjoyed my∣self
in tranquillity, before it was interrupted by
a very unexpected visit.</P>
<P>While I was busy one day dressing in my
dining-room, I found his lordship at my elbow,
before I was aware of his approach, although his
coach was at the door, and the house already in
the possession of his servants. He accosted me
in the usual stile, as if we had parted the night
before; and I answered him with an appearance
of the same careless familiarity, desiring him to
sit down, while I retreated to my chamber,
lock'd the door, and fairly went to bed; being,
perhaps, the first woman who went thither for
protection from the insults of a man. Here then
I immured myself with my faithful Ahigail; and
my lord finding me secured, knocked at the door,
and through the key-hole begg'd to be admitted;
assuring me, that all he wanted was a conference.
I desired to be excused, though I believed his as∣surance;
but I had no inclination to converse
with him, because I knew from experience the
nature of his conversation, which was so disagree∣able
and tormenting, that I wou'd have exchanged
it at any time for a good beating, and thought
myself a gainer by the bargain. However, he
persisted in his importunities to such a degree,
that I assented to his proposal, on condition that
the duke of L—should be present at the in∣terview;
and he immediately sent a message to
his grace, while I in peace ate my breakfast,
<PB N="183" REF="188"/>
conveyed in a basket, which was hoisted up to
the window of my bed-chamber.</P>
<P>The duke was so kind as to come at my lord's
request, and before I would open the door, gave
me his word, that I should be protected from all
violence and compulsion. Thus assured, they
were permitted to enter; and my little gentle∣man
sitting down by the bed-side, began to re∣peat
the old hackneyed arguments he had for∣merly
used, with the view of inducing me to
live with him; and I, on my side, repeated my
former objections, or pretended to listen to his
representations, while my imagination was em∣ployed
in contriving the means of effecting an
escape, as the duke easily perceived by my coun∣tenance.</P>
<P>Finding all his remonstrances ineffectual, he
quitted the chamber, and left his cause to the
eloquence of his grace, who sat with me a whole
half hour, without exerting himself much in be∣half
of his client, because he knew I was alto∣gether
obstinate, and determined on that score;
but joked upon the behaviour of his lord∣ship,
who (though jealous of most people) had
left him alone with me in my bed-chamber, ob∣serving,
that he must either have great confi∣dence
in his virtue, or a very bad opinion of him
afterwise. In short, I found means to defer the
catgorical answer till next day, and invited the
duke and his lordship to dine with me to-morrow.
My wife yoke-fellow seemed to doubt the sin∣cerity
of this invitation, and was very much dis∣posed
to keep possession of my fort: but, by the
p<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>asions of his grace, and the advice of H—n,
who was his chief counsellor and back, he was
<PB N="184" REF="189"/>
prevailed upon to take my word, and for the pre∣sent
left me.</P>
<P>They were no sooner retired, than I rose with
great expedition, pack'd up my cloaths, and took
shelter in Essex for the first time. Next day,
my lord and his noble friend came to dinner, ac∣cording
to appointment; and being informed of
my escape by my woman, whom I had left in the
house, his lordship discovered some signs of dis∣content,
and insisted upon seeing my papers;
upon which, my maid produced a parcel of bills
which I owed to different people. Notwith∣standing
this disappointment, he sat down to
what was provided for dinner, and with great de∣liberation
ate up a leg of lamb, the best part of
a fowl, and something else, which I do not now
remember; and then very peaceably went away,
giving my maid an opportunity of following me
to the place of my retreat.</P>
<P>My intention was to have sought refuge, as
formerly, in another country; but I was pre∣vented
from putting my design in execution by a
fit of illness, during which I was visited by my
physician and some of my own relations, parti∣cularly
a distant cousin of mine, whom my lord had
engaged in his interests, by promising to recom∣pence
her amply, if she could persuade me to
comply with his desire. In this office she was as∣sisted
by the doctor, who was my friend, and a
man of sense, for whom I have the most perfect
esteem, though he and I have often differed in
point of opinion. In a word, I was exposed to
the incessant importunities of all my acquaintance,
which, added to the desperate circumstances of
my fortune, compelled me to embrace the terms
<PB N="185" REF="190"/>
that were offered, and I again returned to the
domestic duties of a wife.</P>
<P>I was conducted to my lord's house by an old
friend of mine, a gentleman turned of fifty, of
admirable parts and understanding; he was a
pleasing companion, chearful and humane, and
had acquired a great share of my esteem and re∣spect.
In a word, his advice had great weight in
my deliberations, because it seemed to be the re∣sult
of experience and disinterested friendship.
Without all doubt, he had an unfeigned concern
for my welfare; but, being an admirable poli∣tician,
his scheme was to make my interest coin∣cide
with his own inclinations; for I had un∣wittingly
made an innovation upon his heart;
and as he thought I should hardly favour his
passion, while I was at liberty to converse with
the rest of my admirers, he counselled me to
sarrender that freedom, well knowing that my
lord would be easily persuaded to banish all his ri∣va's
from the house; in which case, he did not
doubt of his being able to insinuate himself into
my affections; because he laid it down as an
eternal truth, that if any two persons of different
sexes were obliged to live together in a desart,
where they would be excluded from all other
human intercourse, they would naturally and in∣evitably
contract an inclination for each other.</P>
<P>How just this hypothesis may be, I leave to
the determination of the curious; though, if I
may be allowed to judge from my own disposi∣tion,
a couple so situated would be apt to im∣bibe
mutual disgusts, from the nature and ne∣cessity
of their union; unless their association
was at first the effect of reciprocal affection and
esteem. Be this as it will, I honour the gentle∣man
<PB N="186" REF="191"/>
man for his plan, which was ingeniously con∣trived,
and artfully conducted: but I happened
to have too much address for him in the sequel,
cunning as he was, though at first I did not per∣ceive
his drift; and his lordship was much less
likely to comprehend his meaning.</P>
<P>Immediately after this new accommodation, I
was carried to a country-house belonging to my
lord, and was simple enough to venture myself
(unattended by any servant on whose integrity I
could depend) in the hands of his lordship and
H—n, whose villainy I always dreaded; th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
at this time my apprehensions were consi∣derably
increased, by recollecting, that it was
not his interest to let me live in the house, le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t
his conduct should be inquired into; and by re∣membering,
that the very house to which we
were going, had been twice burnt down in a
very short space of time, not without suspicion
of his having been the incendiary, on account of
some box of writings, which was lost in the con∣flagration.
True it is, this imputation was never
made good; and perhaps he was altogether inno∣cent
of the charge, which nevertheless affected
my spirits in such a manner, as rendered me the
most miserable of all mortals; and in this terror
did I remain, till my consternation was weakened
by the arrival of Mr. Bal—, a good natured
worthy man, whom my lord had invited to his
house, and I thought would not see me ill used;
and in a few weeks, we were joined by Dr. S—
and his lady, who visited us according to their
promise; and it was resolved that we should set
out for Tunbridge, on a partie of pleasure, and
at our return examine H—n's accounts.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="192"/>
This last part of our scheme was not all re∣lished
by our worthy steward, who, therefore,
determined to overturn our whole plan, and suc∣ceeded
accordingly. My lord, all of a sudden,
declared himself against the jaunt we had pro∣jected,
and insisted upon my staying at home,
without assigning any reason for this peremptory
behaviour; his countenance became cloudy, and
for the space of three days he did not open his
mouth.</P>
<P>At last, he one night entered my bed-cham∣bet,
to which he now had free access, with his
sword under his arm, and, if I remember aright,
it was ready drawn. I could not help taking no∣tice
of this alarming circumstance, which shocked
me the more, as it happened immediately after a
gloomy fit of discontent. However, I seemed
to overlook the incident, and dismissing my maid,
went to bed; because I was ashamed to ac∣knowledge,
even to my own heart, any dread of
a person whom I despised so much. However,
the strength of my constitution was not equal to
the fortitude of my mind: I was taken ill, and
the servants were obliged to be called up; while
my lord himself, terrified at my situation, ran up
stai<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to Mrs. S—, who was in bed, told her,
with evident perturbation of spirits, that I was
very much indisposed, and said, he believed I
was frightened by his entering my chamber with
his sword in hand.</P>
<P>This lady was so startled at his information,
that she ran into my apartment half-naked, and
as she went down stairs, asked what reason could
induce him to have carried his sword with him?
Upon which he gave her to understand, that his
intention was to kill the bats. I believe and
<PB N="188" REF="193"/>
hope he had no other design than that of intimi∣dating
me, but when the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happened, I was
of a different opinion. Mrs. S—having put on
her cloaths, sat up all night by my bed-side, and
was so good as to assure me, that she would not
leave me, until I should be safely delivered from
the apprehensions that surrounded me in this
house, to which she and the doctor had been the
principal cause of my coming; for my lord had
haunted and importuned them incessantly on this
subject, protesting that he loved me with the
most inviolable affection; and all he desired was,
that I would sit at his table, manage his family,
and share his fortune. By these profession, ut∣tered
with an air of honesty and good-nature, he
had imposed himself upon them, for the best
tempered creature upon earth; and they used
all their influence with me to take him into fa∣vour.
This hath been the case with a great
many people, who had but a superficial know∣le<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge
of his disposition; but, in the course of
their acquaintance, they have never failed to dis∣cern
and acknowledge their mistake.</P>
<P>The doctor, on his return from Tunbridge,
to which place he had made a trip by himself,
found me ill a-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, and the whole family in con∣fusion:
surprized and concerned at this disorder,
he entered into expostulation with my lord, who
owned, that the cause of his displeasure and dis∣quiet
was no other than jealousy: H—had in∣formed
him, that I had been seen to walk out
with Mr. Bal—in a morning; and that our cor∣respondence
had been observed with many addi∣tional
circumstances, which were absolutely false
and groundless. This imputation was no sooner
understood, than it was resolved that the accuser
<PB N="189" REF="194"/>
should be examined, in presence of us all. He
accordingly appeared, exceedingly drunk, tho'
it was morning, and repeated the articles of the
charge, as an information he had received from
a man who came from town to hang the bells,
and was long ago returned to London.</P>
<P>This was an instance of his cunning and ad∣dress,
which did not forsake him even in his
hours of intoxication. Had he fixed the calumny
on any one of the servants, he would have been
confronted and detected in his falshood. Never∣theless,
tho' he could not be legally convicted, it
plainly appeared that he was the author of this
defamation, which incensed Mr. Bal—to such a
degree, that he could scarce be with held from
punishing him on the spot, by manual chastise∣ment.
However, he was prevailed upon to ab∣stain
from such immediate vengeance, as a step
unworthy of his character; and the affair was
brought to this issue, that his lordship should ei∣ther
part with me or Mr. H—; for I was fully
determined against living under the same roof
with such an incendiary.</P>
<P>This alternative being proposed, my lord dis∣miss'd
his steward, and we returned to town with
the doctor and Mrs. S—;for I had imbibed such
horror and aversion for this country seat (tho' one
of the pleasantest in England) that I could not
bear to live in it. We therefore removed to an
house in Bond-street, where, according to the
advice of my friends, I exerted my whole power
and complaisance, in endeavours to keep my
husband in good humour; but was so unsuccess∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
in my attempts, that if ever he was worse
tempered, more capricious, or intolerable, at
one time than at another, this was the season in
<PB N="190" REF="195"/>
which his ill-humour predominated to the most
rancorous degree. I was scarce ever permitted
to stir abroad, saw no-body at home but my old
male-friend whom I have mentioned above, and
the doctor with his lady, from whose conversa∣tion
also I was at last excluded.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I contrived to steal a meeting,
now and then, with my late benefactor, for whom
I entertained a great share of affection, exclusive
of that gratitude which was due to his generosity.
It was not his fault that I compromised matters
with my lord; for he was as free of his purse as
I was unwilling to use it. It would, therefore,
have been unfriendly, unkind, and ungrateful in
me (now that I was in affluence) to avoid all in∣tercourse
with a man who had supported me in
adversity.—I think people cannot be too shy and
scrupulous in receiving favours; but once they
are conferred, they ought never to forget the
obligation: and I was never more concerned at
any incident of my life, than at hearing that this
gentleman did not receive a letter, in which I
acknowledged the last proof of his friendship and
liberality which I had occasion to use, because I
have since learned, that he suspected me of ne∣glect.</P>
<P>But, to return to my situation in Bond-street,
I bore it as well as I could for the space of three
months, during which I lived in the midst of
spies who were employed to watch my conduct;
and underwent every mortification that malice,
power, and folly could inflict. Nay, so ridiculous,
so unreasonable was my tyrant in his spleen,
that he declared he would even be jealous of He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣digger,
if there was no other man to incur his
suspicion: he expected that I should spend my
whole time with him, <HI>téte a téte;</HI> and when I
<PB N="191" REF="196"/>
sacrificed my enjoyment to these comfortable
parties, he never failed to lay hold on some inno∣cent
expression of mine, which he made the
foundation of a quarrel; and when I strove to
avoid these disagreeable misinterpretations, by
reading or writing, he incessantly teized and tor∣mented
me with the imputation of being peevish,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullen and reserved.</P>
<P>Harrassed by this insufferable behaviour, I
communicated my case to Dr. S—and his lady,
intimating that I neither could nor would expose
myself any longer to such usage. The doctor
exhorted me to bear my fate with patience, and
Mrs. S—was silent on the subject; so that I still
hesitated between staying and going, when the
doctor being one night at supper, happened to
have some words with my lord, who was so vio∣lently
transported with passion, that I was ac∣tually
afraid of going to bed with him; and next
morning when he waked, there was such an ex∣pression
of frantic wildness in his countenance,
that I imagined he was actually distracted.</P>
<P>This alarming circumstance confirmed me in
my resolution of decamping; and I accordingly
moved my quarters to an house in Sackville∣street,
where I had lodged when I was a widow;
and when I was settled, sent a message to the
duke of L—, desiring he would make my lord
acquainted with the place of my abode, my rea∣sons
for removing, and my intention to defend
myself against all his attempts. The first night
of this separation I went to bed by myself, with
as much pleasure as a man could do in going to
bed to his mistress, whom he had long solicited
in vain. So rejoiced was I to be delivered from
my obnoxious bedfellow!</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="197"/>
I had not long changed my lodgings, which
I did to Brook-street, and enjoyed the sweets of
my escape, when I was importuned to return, by
a new steward whom my lord had engaged in the
room of H—n. This gentleman, who bore a
very fair character, made such judicious repre∣sentations,
and behaved so candidly in the dis∣charge
of his function, that I agreed he should
act as umpire in the difference between us; and
once more a reconciliation was effected, tho' his
lordship began to be dissatisfied even before the
execution of our agreement, in consequence of
which he attended me to Bath, whither I went
for the benefit of my health, which was not a
little impaired.</P>
<P>This accommodation had a surprising effect
upon my lover, who, notwithstanding his re∣peated
declarations, that no woman should ever
gain such an ascendency over his heart, as to be
able to give him pain, suffered all the agonies of
disappointed love, when he now found himself
deprived of the opportunities of seeing me, and
behaved very differently from what he had ima∣gined
he should: his words and actions were des∣perate;
one of his expressions to me was, “It
is like twisting my heart-strings, and tearing
it out of my body.” And I should never have
done it, had I thoug<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t he would have suffered;
but I protest I believed him when he said other∣wise
so much, that it was the occasion of my giv∣ing
him up; and it was now too late to re∣tract.</P>
<P>In our expedition to the Bath I was ac∣companied
by a very agreeable young lady,
with whom I pas'd my time very happily, amid
the diversions of the place, which s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ened
<PB N="193" REF="198"/>
me, in a good measure, from the vexatious so∣ciety
of my hopeful partner. From this place
we repaired to his seat in the country, where we
spent a few months, and thence returned again
to our house in Bond-street. Here, while I was
confined to my bed by illness, it was supposed
my indisposition was no other than a private ly∣ing
in, tho' I was under the roof with my lord,
and attended by his servants.</P>
<P>While my distemper continued, my lord (to
do him justice) behaved with all imaginable ten∣derness
and care; and his concern on these occa∣sions
I have already mentioned, as a strange in∣consistency
in his disposition. If his actions were
at all accountable, I should think he took pains
to fret me into a fever first, in order to manifest
his love and humanity afterwards. When I re∣covered
my strength and spirits, I went abroad,
saw company, and should have been easy, had he
been contented; but as my satisfaction increased,
his good humour decayed, and he hanished, from
his house, one by one, all the people whose con∣versation
could have made my life agreeable.</P>
<P>I often expostulated with him upon this malig∣nant
behaviour, protesting my desire of living
peaceably with him; and begging he would not
lay me under the necessity of changing my mea∣sures.
He was deaf to all my remonstrances,
(tho' I warned him more than once of the event)
persisted in his maxims of persecution; and, after
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epeated quarrels, I again left his house, fully de∣termined
to suffer all sorts of extremity, rather
than subject myself to the tyranny of his dispo∣sition.</P>
<P>This year was productive of one fatal event,
which I felt with the utmost sensibility of sorrow,
<PB N="194" REF="199"/>
and shall always remember with regret: I mean
the death of Mr. B—, with whom I had con∣stantly
maintained an intimate correspondence
since the first commencement of our acquaint∣ance.
He was one of the most valuable m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and
promised to be one of the brightest ornaments that
this or any other age had produced. I enjoyed
his friendship, without reserve; and such was the
confidence he reposed in my integrity, from long
experience of my truth, that he often said he
would believe my bare assertion, even tho' it
should contradict the evidence of his own senses,
These being the terms upon which we lived, it is
not to be supposed that I bore the loss of him
without repining: indeed my grief was unspeak∣able;
and tho' the edge of it be now smoothed
by the lenient hand of time, I shall never cease
to cherish his memory with the most tender re∣membrance.</P>
<P>During the last period of my living with my
lord, I had agreed to the expediency of obtain∣ing
an act of parliament, which would enable
him to pay his debts; on which occasion there
was a necessity for cancelling a deed that subsist∣ed
between us, relating to a separate mainte∣nance;
to which, on certain provisos, I was in∣titled:
and this was to be set aside, so far as it
interfered with the above mentioned scheme,
while the rest of it should remain in force. When
this affair was about to be transacted, my lord
very generously insisted upon my concurrence, in
annulling the whole settlement; and when I re∣fused
to comply with this demand, because this
was the sole resource I had against his ill usage, he
would not proceed in the execution of his plan,
tho' by dropping it he hurt no-body but himself;
<PB N="195" REF="200"/>
and accused me of having receded from my word,
after I had drawn him into a considerable ex∣pence.</P>
<P>This imputation of breaking my word, which
I defy the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le world to prove I ever did, in∣censed
me the more, as I myself had proposed the
scheme for his service, altho' I knew the accom∣plishment
of it would endanger the validity of
my own settlement; and my indignation was
still more augmented by the behaviour of Mr.
G—, who had always professed a regard for my
interest, and upon my last accommodation with
my lord, undertaken to effect a reconciliation be∣tween
my father and me: but when he was que∣stioned
about the particulars of this difference,
and desired to declare whether his lordship or I
was to blame, he declined the office of arbitra∣tor,
refused to be explicit on the subject, and by
certain shrewd hums and ha's signified his disap∣probation
of my conduct; and yet this very man,
when I imparted to him, in confidence, my in∣tention
of making another retreat, and frankly
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed his opinion of my design, seemed to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
in the justice of it, in these remarkable
words: “Madam, if I thought, or had hopes
of my lord's growing better, I would down
on my knees, to desire you to stay; but as I
have not, I say nothing.”</P>
<P>If he connived at my conduct in this particu∣lar,
why should he disapprove of it, when all I
asked was but common justice? But he was a de∣pendent;
and therefore I excuse his phlegmatic
not to call it unfriendly) behaviour. Indeed he
could not be too cautious of giving offence to his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rdship, who sometimes made him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f∣fects
of that wrath which other people had
<PB N="196" REF="201"/>
kindled; particularly, in consequence of a small
adventure which happened about this very period
of time.</P>
<P>A very agreeable, sprightly, good-natured
young man, a near relation of my lord, hap∣pening
to be at our house one evening, when
there was a fire in the neighbourhood, we agreed
to go and sup at a tavern, <HI>en famille;</HI> and hav∣ing
spent the evening with great mirth and good
humour, this young gentleman, who was natu∣rally
facetious, in taking his leave, saluted us all
round. My lord, who had before entertained
some jealousy of his kinsman, was very much
provoked by this trifling incident, but very pru∣dently
suppressed his displeasure till he returned to
his own house, where his rage co-operating with
the Champagne he had drank, inflamed him to
such a degree of resolution, that he sprung upon
the innocent G—n, and collared him with great
fury, though he was altogether unconcerned in
the cause of his indignation.</P>
<P>This extravagant and frantic behaviour, added
to the other grievances under which I laboured,
hastened my resolution of leaving him; and he
to this day blames his relation, as the immediate
cause of my escape, whereas he ought to place it
to the account of his own madness and indiscre∣tion.
When I retired to Park-street, he c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣tioned
all my tradesmen (not even excepting my
baker) against giving me credit, assuring them
that he would not pay any debts I should con∣tract;
and the difficulties to which I was re∣duced,
in consequence of this charitable declara∣tion,
together with the reflection of what I had
suffered, and might underg<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, from the c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>price
and barbarity of his disposition, affected my
<PB N="197" REF="202"/>
health so much, that I was taken again ill, and
my life thought in danger.</P>
<P>My constitution, however, got the better of
my distemper, and I was ordered into the coun∣try
by my physicians, for the benefit of the air;
so that I found myself under the necessity of keep∣ing
two houses, when I was little able to support
one, and set up my chariot, because I could
not defray the expence of an hackney coach; for
I had as much credit given me as I ask'd for, not∣withstanding
my lord's orders to the contrary.</P>
<P>Having recruited my spirits in the country, I
returned to town, and was visited by my friends,
who never forsook me in adversity, and in the
summer removed to an house in Essex, where I
lived a few months in great tranquillity, unmo∣lested
by my tyrant, who sometimes gave me a
whole year's respite. Here I used to ride and
drive by turns (as my humour dictated) with
horses which were lent me; and I had the com∣pany
of my lover, and another gentleman, who
was a very agreeable companion, and of singu∣lar
service to me in the sequel.</P>
<P>At last, my lord having received intelligence
of the place of my abode, and his tormenting hu∣mour
recurring, he set out for my habitation,
and in the morning appeared in his coach and
six, attended by Mr. G—n, and another person,
whom he had engaged for the purpose, with se∣veral
domesticks armed. I immediately shut up
my doors at his approach, and refused him admit∣tance,
which he endeavoured to obtain by a suc∣cession
of prayers and threats; but I was deaf to
both, and resolved to hold out to the last. See∣ing
me determined, he began his attack, and his
servants actually forced their way into the house;
<PB N="198" REF="203"/>
upon which I retreated up stairs, and fortified
myself in an apartment, which the assailants
stormed with such fury, that the door began to
give way, and I retired into another room.</P>
<P>Whilst I remained in this post, Mr. G—n
demanded a parley, in which he begg'd I would
favour my lord with an interview, otherwise he
knew not what would be the consequence. To
this remonstrance I replied, that I was not dis∣posed
to comply with his request; and that
though their design should be murder, I was not
at all a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raid of death. Upon this declaration they
renewed their attacks, which they carried on
with indifferent success till the afternoon, when
my lord (as if he had been at play) sent a formal
message to me, desiring that all hostilities should
cease, till after both parties should have dined.
At the same time, my own servants came for in∣structions;
and I ordered them to let him have
every thing which he should call for, as far as the
house would afford.</P>
<P>He did not fail to make use of this permission;
but, sitting down with his companions, ate up
my dinner without hesitation, after he had paid
me the compliment, or desiring to know what he
should send up to my apartment. Far from hav∣ing
any stomach to partake of his meal, I sat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>∣tary
upon my bed, in a state of melancholy ex∣pectation,
having fastened the door of the o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t∣ward
room for my security, while I kept my
chamber open for the convenience of air, the
weather being excessively hot.</P>
<P>His lordship having indulged his appetite, re∣sumed
his attempt, and all of a sudden I heard a
noise in the next room; upon which I started up,
and perceiving that he had got into my anti∣chamber,
<PB N="199" REF="204"/>
by the help of a bench that stood un∣der
the window, I flung to the door of my room,
which I locked with great expedition, and open∣ing
another that communicated with the stair∣case,
ran out of the house, through a croud of
more than an hundred people, whom this fray
had gathered together.</P>
<P>Being universally beloved in the neighbour∣hood,
and respected by my lord's servants, I
passed among them untouched, and took refuge
in a neighbouring cottage; while his lordship
bawled and roared for assistance, being afraid to
c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me out as he had got in. Without waiting
for his deliberations, I changed cloaths with the
poor woman who had given me shelter, and in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er clue apron and straw-hat sallied out into the
fields, intending to seek protection at the house
of a gentleman not far off, though I was utterly
ignorant of the road that led to it. However, it
was my good fortune to meet with a farmer, who
undertook to conduct me to the place; otherwise
I should have missed my way, and, in all proba∣bility,
lain in the fields; for, by this time, it
was eight o'clock at night.</P>
<P>Under the direction of this guide, I traversed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dges and ditches, (for I would not venture to
navel in the highway, lest I should fall into the
han's of my pursuer) and after I had actually
tum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led in the mire, and walked six or seven long
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by the help of a good spirit, which never
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me on such occasions, I arrived at the
place, and rung the bell at the garden-gate for
admittance. Seeing my figure, which was very
unc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uth, together with my draggled condition,
they denied me entrance; but when they under∣stood
who I was, immediately opened the door,
<PB N="200" REF="205"/>
and I was hospitably entertained, after having
been the subject of mirth, on account of my
dress and adventure.</P>
<P>Next day I returned, and took possession of
my house again, where I resumed my former
amusements, which I enjoyed in quiet, for the
space of a whole month, waiting with resignation
for the issue of my law-suit; when one after∣noon,
I was apprized of his lordship's approach,
by one of my spies, whom I always employed to
reconnoitre the road; and so fortunate was I in
the choice of these scouts, that I never was be∣trayed
by one of them, though they were often
bribed for that purpose.</P>
<P>I no sooner received this intelligence, than I
ordered my horse to be saddled, and mounting,
rode out of sight immediately, directing my
course a different way from the London road. I
had not long proceeded in this tract, when my
career was all of a sudden stopp'd by a five-b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r
gate, which, after some hesitation, I resolved to
leap (my horse being an old hunter) if I should
find myself pursued. However, with much dif∣ficulty
I made shift to open it, and arrived in
safety at the house of my very good friend Mr.
G—, who being a justice of the peace, had
promised me his protection, if it should be
wanted.</P>
<P>Thus secured for the present, I sent out spies
to bring information of his lordship's proceedings,
and understood that he had taken possession of
my house, turned my servants adrift, and made
himself master of all my moveables, cloaths and
papers. As for the papers, they were of no con∣sequence,
but of cloaths I had a good stock; and
when I had reason to believe that he did not in∣tend
to relinquish his conquest, I thought it was
<PB N="201" REF="206"/>
high time for me to remove to a greater distance
from his quarters. Accordingly, two days after
my escape, I set out at eleven o'clock at night,
in a chariot and four, which I borrowed of my
friend, attended by a footman, who was a stout
fellow and well armed, I myself being provided
with a brace of good pistols, which I was fully
determined to use, against any person who should
presume to lay violent hands upon me, except
my lord, for whom a less morral weapon would
have sufficed, such as a bodkin or a tinder-box.
Nothing could be farther from my intention, than
the desire of hurting any living creature, much
less my husband; my design was only to defend
myself from cruelty and oppression, which I
knew, by fatal experience, would infallibly be
my lot, should he get me into his power: and I
thought I had as good a right to preserve my
happiness, as that which every individual has to
preserve his life, especially against a set of ruf∣fians,
who were engaged to rob me of it, for a
little dirty lucre.</P>
<P>In the midst of our journey, the footman
came up, and told me I was dogg'd; upon which
I looked out, and seeing a man riding by the
chariot-side, presented one of my pistols out at
the window, and preserved that posture of de∣fence,
until he thought proper to retreat, and
rid me of the fears that attended his company.
I arrived in town, and changing my equipage,
hired an open chaise, in which (though I was al∣most
starved with cold) I travelled to Reading,
which I reached by ten next morning; and from
thence proceeded farther in the country, with a
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew of taking refuge with Mrs. C—, who
was my particular friend. Here I should have
<PB N="202" REF="207"/>
found shelter, though my lord had been before∣hand
with me, and endeavoured to prepossess her
against my conduct, had not the house been
crouded with company, among whom I could
not possibly have been concealed, especially from
her brother, who was an intimate friend of my
persecutor.</P>
<P>Things being thus situated, I enjoyed but a
very short interview with her, in which her sor∣row
and perplexity on my account appeared with
great expression in her countenance; and though
it was not in her power to afford me the relief I
expected, she, in the most genteel manner, sent
after me a small sum of money, thinking that,
considering the hurry in which I left my house, I
might have occasion for it on the road. I was
by this time benumbed with cold, fatigued with
travelling, and almost fretted to death by my dis∣appointment.
However, this was no time to in∣dulge
despondence; since no body could, or
would, assist me, I stood the more in need of
my own resolution and presence of mind. After
some deliberation, I steered my course back to
London; and being unwilling to return by the
same road in which I came, as well as impatient
to be at the end of my journey, I chose the Bag∣shot
way, and ventured to cross the heath by
moon-light.</P>
<P>Here I was attacked by a foot-pad armed with
a broad-sword, who came up, and demanded my
money. My stock amounted to twelve guineas;
and I foresaw, that should I be stripp'd of the
whole sum, I could not travel without discovering
who I was, and, consequently, running the risk
of being detected by my pursuer. On these con∣siderations,
I gave the fellow three guineas and
<PB N="203" REF="208"/>
some silver; with which he was so far from being
satisfied, that he threatened to search me for
m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re: but I ordered the coachman to proceed,
and by good fortune escaped that ceremony;
though I was under some apprehension of being
overtaken with a pistol-bullet in my flight, and
therefore held down my head in the chaise, in
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itation of some great men, who are said to
have ducked in the same manner, in the day of
battle.</P>
<P>My fears happened to be disappointed: I lay
at an inn upon the road, and next day arrived in
town, in the utmost difficulty and distress; for I
knew not where to fix my habitation, and was
destitute of all means of support. In this di∣lemma,
I applied to my lawyer, who recom∣mended
me to the house of a tradesman in West∣minster,
where I lodged and boarded, upon cre∣dit,
with my faithful Abigail, (whom I shall di∣stinguish
by the name of Mrs. S—r) for the
space of ten weeks, during which I saw nobody,
and never once stirred abroad.</P>
<P>While I was thus harrassed out of all enjoy∣ment
of life, and reduced to the utmost indi∣gence,
by the cruelty of my persecut<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, who had
even str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pp'd me of my wearing apparel, I made
a conquest of lord D—, a nobleman who is
now dead, and therefore I shall say little of his
character, which is perfectly well known: this
only will I observe, that, next to my own ty∣rant,
he was the only person of whom I had the
greatest abhorrence. Nevertheless, when these
two came in competition, I preferred the offers
of this new lover, which were very considerable;
and as an asylum was the chief thing I wanted,
agreed to follow <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m to his country-seat, whither
<PB N="204" REF="209"/>
I actually sent my cloaths, which I had purchased
upon credit.</P>
<P>However, upon mature deliberation, I changed
my mind, and signified my resolution in a letter,
desiring at the same time, that my baggage might
be sent back. In consequence of this message, I
expected a visit from him, in all the rage of in∣dignation
and disappointment, and gave orders,
that he should not be admitted into my house:
yet, notwithstanding this precaution, he found
means to procure entrance; and one of the first
objects that I saw, next morning, in my bed∣chamber,
was my lover, armed with his horse∣whip,
against which (from the knowledge of the
man) I did not think myself altogether secure;
though I was not much alarmed, because I be∣lieved
myself superior to him in point of bravery,
should the worst come to the worst: but, con∣trary
to my expectation, and his usual behaviour
to our sex, he accosted me very politely, and
began to expostulate upon the contents of my
letter. I freely told him, that I had rashly as∣sented
to his proposal, for my own convenience
only; that when I reflected on what I had done,
I thought it ungenerous in me to live with him
upon these terms; and that, as I did not like
him, and could not dissemble, such a correspon∣dence
could never tend to the satisfaction of ei∣ther.
He allowed the inference was just, though
he was very much chagrined at my previous pro∣ceeding:
he relinquished his claim, restored my
cloaths, and never afterwards upbraided me with
my conduct in this affair; though he at one time
owned, that he still loved me, and ever should,
because I had used him ill; a declaration that
strongly marks the peculiarity of his character.
<PB N="205" REF="210"/>
As for my own part, I own that my behaviour on
this occasion, is no other way excusable, than
on account of the miserable perplexity of my cir∣cumstances,
which were often so calamitous,
that I wonder I have not been compelled to take
such steps, as would have rendered my conduct
much more exceptionable than it really is.</P>
<P>At last, all my hopes were blasted by the issue
of my suit, which was determined in favour of
my lord. Even then I refused to yield; on the
contrary, coming out of retirement, I took lodg∣ings
in Suffolk-street, and set my tyrant at de∣fiance.
But, being unwilling to trust my doors
to the care of other people, I took an house in
Conduit-street; and no sooner appeared in the
world again, than I was surrounded by divers
and sundry sorts of admirers. I believe I received
the incense and addresses of all kinds under the
sun, except that sort which was most to my
liking, a man capable of contracting and in∣spaing
a mutual attachment; but such a one is
equally rare and inestimable: not but that I own
myself greatly obliged to all those who cultivated
my good graces, though they were very little be∣holden
to me; for, where I did not really love, I
could never profess that passion: that sort of dissi∣mulation
is a slavery that no honest nature will un∣dergo.
Except one worthy young man whom I
sometimes saw, they were a strange medley of
insignificant beings; one was insipid, another
ridiculously affected, a third void of all education,
a fourth altogether inconsistent; and in short, I
found as many trifling characters among the men,
as ever I observed in my own sex. Some of them
I endeavoured to bring over to my maxims,
whole they attempted to make a prosely t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of me;
<PB N="206" REF="211"/>
but finding the task impracticable on both sides,
we very wisely dropt each other.</P>
<P>At length, however, I was blessed with the ac∣quaintance
of one nobleman, who is, perhaps,
the first character in England, in point of ho∣nour,
integrity, wit, sense and benevolence:
when I have thus distinguished him, I need
scarce mention lord—. This great, this
good man, possesses every accomplishment re∣quisite
to inspire admiration, love and esteem.
With infinitely more merit than almost ever fell
to one man's share, he manifests such diffidence
of his own qualifications, as cannot fail to pre∣possess
every company in his favour. He seems
to observe nothing, yet sees every thing; his
manner of telling a story, and making trifles ele∣gant,
is peculiar to himself; and though he has a
thousand oddities, they serve only to make him
more agreeable. After what I have said, it may
be supposed that I was enamoured of his person:
but this was not the case; love is altogether ca∣pricious
and fanciful; yet I admire, honour, and
esteem him to the highest degree; and when I
observe, that his character resembled that of my
dear departed friend Mr. B—; or rather, that
Mr. B—, had he lived, would have resembled
lord—, I pay the highest compliment I
can conceive both to the living and the dead.</P>
<P>In this nobleman's friendship and conversation
I thought myself happy; though I was, as usual,
exposed to the indefatigable efforts of my lord,
who, one day, while I was favoured with the
company of this generous friend, appeared at my
door in his coach, attended by another gentle∣man,
who demanded entrance, with an air of
authority. A very honest footman, who had
<PB N="207" REF="212"/>
been long in my service, ran up stairs in the ut∣most
consternation, and gave me an account of
what had happened below. Upon which, I told
him he had nothing to answer for, and ordered
him to keep the door fast shut against all opposi∣tion:
though I was so much affected with this
unexpected assault, that lord—said, he
w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s never more surprized and shocked in his life,
than at the horror which appeared in my coun∣tenance,
when I saw the coach stop at my door.</P>
<P>My little hero being refused admittance, went
away, threatening to return speedily with a re∣inforcement;
and during this interval, I provided
myself with a soldier, whom I placed centinel at
the door withinside, to guard me from the danger
of such assaults for the future. My lord, true to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> promise, marched back with his auxiliaries,
r<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nforced with a constable, and repeated his de∣mand
of being admitted; and my soldier open∣ing
the sash, in order to answer him according
to my directions, he no sooner perceived the red
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> than he was seized with such a pannic, that
he instantly fled with great precipitation; and
when he recounted the adventure, like Falstaff in
the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> multiplied my guard into a whole sile
o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> masqueteers. He also made shift to discover
the gentleman, who had been so kind as to lend
me one of his company, and complained of him
to the duke of N—, in hopes of seeing him
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>roke for this misdemeanour; but in that expec∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
he was luckily disappointed.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that in England I should never en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, but be continually subject to those
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and disquiets which had already impaired
my health and spirits, I resolved to repair again
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, my best refuge and sure retreat from
<PB N="208" REF="213"/>
the persecution of my tyrant. Yet, before I
took this step, I endeavoured, by the adv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce of
my friends, to conceal myself near Windsor;
but was in a little time discovered by my lord,
and hunted out of my lurking place, accordingly.
I then removed to Chelsea, where I suffered in∣conceivable
uneasiness and agitation of m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd,
from the nature of my situation, my tranquil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity
being thus incessantly invaded by a man who
could not be satisfied with me, and yet could not
live without me: so that, though I was very
much indisposed, I set out for France, by the
way of the Hague, as the war had shut up all
other communication, having no other attendant
but my woman S—r, who, though she dreaded
the sea, and was upon the brink of matrimony,
would not quit me in such a calamitous condition,
until I was joined by my footman and other
maid, whom I ordered to follow me with the
baggage. But, before my departure, I sent a
message to lord—, demanding my cloaths,
which he had seized in Essex; and he refusing to
deliver them, I was obliged to equip myself anew,
upon credit.</P>
<P>I was supplied with money for my journey by
my good friend L—; and after a short and
pleasant passage, arrived at the Hague, where I
stayed two months, and parted with S—r, on
whom I settled an annuity of five and twenty
pounds, payable out of the provision which I had
or might obtain from my husband. The same
allowance had I prevailed upon lord B—to
grant to another maid, who attended me while
I lived in his house.</P>
<P>I did not much relish the people in Holland,
because they seemed entirely devoted to self-in∣terest,
<PB N="209" REF="214"/>
without any taste for pleasure or polite∣ness;
a species of disposition that could not be
very agreeable to me, who always despised mo∣ney,
had an unbounded benevolence of heart,
and loved pleasure beyond every other considera∣tion.
When I say pleasure, I would not be un∣derstood
to mean sensuality, which constitutes
the supreme happiness of those only, who are
void of sentiment and imagination. Neverthe∣less,
I received some civilities in this place; and
among the rest, the reputation of having for my
lever the king of P—'s minister, who was young
and airy, and visited me often; circumstances that
were sufficient to lay me under the imputation of
an amour, which I frequently incurred, without
having given the least cause of suspicion.</P>
<P>Having taken leave of my Dutch friends, I
departed from the Hague, in company with an
Englishwoman, whom I had chose for that pur∣pose,
and arrived at Antwerp, with much diffi∣culty
and danger, the highway being infested
with robbers. After having reposed myself a few
da<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s in this city, I hired a coach for myself, and
set out, with my companion, for Brussels; but,
before we reached Mechlin, our vehicle was at∣tacked
by two hussars, who, with their sabres
drawn, obliged the coachman to drive into a
wood near the road. I at first imagined they
wanted to examine o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r passports, bat was soon
too well convinced of their design; and though
very much shocked at the discovery, found reso∣lution
enough to suppress my concern, so that it
should not aggravate the terrors of the young
woman, who had almost died with apprehension.
I even encouraged her to hope for the best; and
addressing myself to the robbers in French, begg'd
in the most suppliant manner, that they would
<PB N="210" REF="215"/>
spare our lives; upon which, one of them, who
was a little fellow, assured me in the same lan∣guage,
that we had nothing to fear for our
persons.</P>
<P>When we were conveyed in a state of dreadful
suspence about three quarters of a mile into the
wood, the ruffians came into the coach, and tak∣ing
my keys, which I kept ready in my hand
for them, opened three large trunks, that con∣tained
my baggage, and emptying them of every
thing but my hoops and a few books, packed up
their booty in a cloth; then robbing me of my
money and jewels, even to my shoe-buckles and
sleeve-buttons, took my footman's laced hat,
and gave it, by way of gratification, to a peasant,
who came from behind the bushes, and assisted
them in packing.</P>
<P>This affair being dispatched, they ordered us
to return to the road, by a different way from
that in which we were carried into the wood;
and mounting their horses, rode off with the
plunder, though not before the little fellow, who
was the least ferocious of the two, had come and
shaken me by the hand, wishing us a good jour∣ney;
a compliment which I heartily returned,
being extremely well pleased at the retreat of two
such companions, who had detained us a whole
half hour; during which, notwithstanding the
assurance I had received, I was in continual ap∣prehension
of seeing their operation conclude
with the murder of us all; for I supposed they
were of that gang, who had some time before
murthered a French officer, and used a lady ex∣tremely
ill, after having rifled her of all she had.</P>
<P>Having thus undergone pillage, and being re∣duced
to the extremity of indigence in a foreign
<PB N="211" REF="216"/>
land, it is not to be supposed that my reflections
were very comfortable; and yet, though I su∣stained
the whole damage, I was the only person
in the company who bore the accident with any
resolution and presence of mind. My coachman
and valet seemed quite petrified with sear; and it
was not, till I had repeated my directions, that
the former drove farther into the wood, and took
the first turning to the right, in order to re¦gain
the road, according to the command of the
robbers, which I did not choose to disobey.</P>
<P>This misfortune I suffered by the misinforma∣tion
I received at Antwerp, where I would have
provided myself with an escort, had I not been
assured, that there was not the least occasion to
put myself to such extraordinary expence: and
indeed, the robbers took the only half hour in
which they could have had an opportunity of
plundering us; for we no sooner returned into
the Highway, than we met with the French ar∣tillery
coming from Brussels, which was a secu∣rity
to us, during the rest of our journey. We
were afterwards informed at a small village, that
there was actually a large gang of deserters, who
harboured in that wood, from which they made
excursions in the neighbourhood, and kept the
peasants in continual alarms.</P>
<P>Having proceeded a little way, we were stopp'd
by the artillery crossing a bridge; and as the
train was very long, must have been detained til<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
night, had not a soldier informed me, that if I
would take the trouble to come out of my coach,
and apply to the commandant, he would order
them to halt, and allow me to pass. I took the
man's advice, and was by him conducted, with
much difficulty, through the croud to some of∣ficers,
<PB N="212" REF="217"/>
who seemed scarce to deserve the name;
for, when I signified my request, they neither
rose up, nor desired me to sit down; but lo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing
in their chairs, with one leg stretched out, asked,
with an air of disrespectful raillery, where I was
going; and when I answered, “To Paris;” de∣sired
to know what I would do there.</P>
<P>I, who am naturally civil where I am civilly
used, and saucy enough where I think myself
treated with disregard, was very much piqued at
their insolent and unmannerly behaviour, and be∣gan
to reply to their impertinent questions, very
abruptly; so that a very tart dialogue would have
ensued, had not the conversation been interrupted
by a tall, thin, genteel young French nobleman,
an officer in the army, who chancing to come in,
asked with great politeness, what I would please
to have. I then repeated my desire, and pro∣duced
my passports, by which he learn'd who I
was. He immediately gave orders, that my
coach should pass; and afterwards visited me at
Paris, having obtained my permission, and taken
my address at parting; while the others, under∣standing
my name and quality, asked pardon for
their impolite carriage, which they told me was
owing to the representation of the soldier, who
gave them to understand, that I was a strolling
actress.</P>
<P>I could not help laughing heartily at this mi∣stake,
which might have proceeded from the cir∣cumstances
of my appearance, my footman hav∣ing
been obliged to change hats with the peasant,
and myself being without buckles in my shoes,
and buttons in my riding-shirt, while my counte∣nance
still retained marks of the fear and confu∣sion
I had undergone. After all, perhaps the fel∣low
<PB N="213" REF="218"/>
was a droll, and wanted to entertain him∣self
at my expence.</P>
<P>The day was so far consumed in these adven∣tures,
that I was obliged to take up my lodging
at Mechlin, where I addressed myself to the in∣tendant,
giving him an account of the disaster I
had met with, and desiring I might have credit
at the inn, as our whole company could not raise
the value of a six-pence. This gentleman, tho'
a provincial, was polite in his way, and not only
granted my request, but invited me to lodge at
his own house. I accordingly gave him my com∣pany
at supper, but did not choose to sleep in his
quarters, because he appeared to be what the
French call <HI>un vieux debauché.</HI></P>
<P>Next day, he sent a trumpet to the general,
with a detail of my misfortune, in hopes of re∣trieving
what I had lost; but, notwithstanding
all possible search, I was fain to put up with my
damage, which, in linen, laces, cloaths and bau∣bles,
amounted to upwards of seven hundred
pounds: a loss which never deprived me of one
moment's rest; for though I lodged at a mise∣rable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and lay in a paultry bed, I slept as
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und as if nothing extraordinary had happened,
after I had written to London and Paris, direct∣ing
that the payment of my bills of credit might
be stopp'd. Indeed, I know but of two misfor∣tunes
in life, capable of depressing my spirits,
namely, the loss of health and friends; all others
may be prevented, or endured. The articles of
that calamity, which I chiefly regretted, were a
picture of lord W—m, and some inimitable
letters from Mr. B—.</P>
<P>From Mechlin I proceeded to Brussels, where
being known, I got credit for some necessaries,
<PB N="214" REF="219"/>
and borrowed twenty guineas, to defray the ex∣pence
of my journey to Paris. Having consulted
with my friends, about the safest method of tra∣velling
through Flanders, I was persuaded to
take places in the public Voiture; and accord∣ingly
departed, not without fears of finding one
part of the country as much infested with robbers
as another. Nor were these apprehensions as∣suaged
by the conversation of my fellow-travellers,
who being of the lower sort of people, that de∣light
in exaggerating dangers, entertained me all
the way, with an account of all the robberies
and murders which had been committed on that
road, with many additional circumstances of their
own invention.</P>
<P>After having been two days exposed to this
comfortable conversation, among very disagree∣able
company, which is certainly one of the most
disagreeable situations in life, I arrived at Lisle,
where, thinking the dangerous part of the jour∣ney
was now past, I hired a post-chaise, and in
two days more reached Paris, without any farther
mol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>station.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in this capital, I was imme∣diately
visited by my old acquaintances, who
hearing my disaster, offered me their cloaths, and
insisted upon my wearing them, until I could be
otherwise provided. They likewise engaged me
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parties, with a view of amusing my imagina∣tion,
that I might not grow melancholy in re∣flecting
upon my loss; and desired me to repeat
the particulars of my story forty times over, ex∣pressing
great surprize at our not being mur∣thered,
or ravished at least. As for this last sp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of outrage, the fear of it never once entered
my he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, otherwise I should have been more
<PB N="215" REF="220"/>
shocked and alarmed than I really was: but it
seems this was the chief circumstance of my
companion's apprehension; and I cannot help ob∣serving,
that an homely woman is always more
apt to entertain those fears, than one whose per∣son
exposes her to much more imminent danger.
However, I now learned, that the risk I ran was
much greater than I imagined it to be, those ruf∣fians
being familiarized to rape as well as murder.</P>
<P>Soon after my appearance in Paris, I was fa∣voured
with the addresses of several French lo∣vers;
but I never had any taste for foreigners, or
indeed for any amusement of that kind, except
such as were likely to be lasting, and settled upon
a more agreeable footing than that of common
gallantry. When I deviated from this principle,
my conduct was the effect of compulsion, and
theref<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re I was never easy under it, having been
reduced to the alternative of two evils, the least
of which I was obliged to choose, as a man leaps
into the sea, in order to escape from a ship that is
on fire.</P>
<P>Though I rejected their love, I did not refuse
their company and conversation; and though my
health was considerably impaired by the shock I
received in my last adventure, which was con∣siderably
greater than I at first imagined, and af∣fected
my companion so much, that she did not
recover her spirits, till she returned to England:
I say, though I was for some time a valetudina∣rian,
I enjoyed myself in great tranquillity for the
space of ten months, during which I was visited
by English, Scotch, and French, of all parties and
persuasions; for pleasure is of no faction, and
that was the chief object of my pursuit; neither
was I so ambitious of being a politician, as to
<PB N="216" REF="221"/>
employ my time and thoughts upon subjects
which I did not understand. I had admirers of
all sides, and should have spent my time very
much to my liking, had not I felt my funds sen∣sibly
diminish, without any prospect of their being
repaired; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or I had been obliged to lay out a great
part of the sum allotted for my subsistence, in
supplying my companion, my servant and myself
with necessaries, in lieu of those which we had
lost.</P>
<P>Having before mine eyes the uncomfortable
prospect of wanting money in a strange place, I
found myself under the necessity of returning to
England, where I had more resources than I could
possibly have among foreigners; and with that
view wrote to lord—'s agents, desiring that I
might be enabled to discharge my obligations at
Paris, by the payment of my pin-money. Thus
a negotiation commenced, and his lordship pro∣mised
to remit money for the clearance of my
Paris debts, which amounted to four hundred
pounds: but he would not advance one farthing
more, though I gave him to understand, that
while he protracted the agreement, I must inevi∣tably
be adding to my incumbrances, and that I
should be as effectually detained by a debt of
twenty pounds, as if I owed a thousand. Not∣withstanding
all my representation, he would
not part with one shilling over the neat sum which
I had at first stipulated; so that all my measures
were rendered abortive, and I found it altogether
impracticable to execute those resolutions I had
formed in his favour.</P>
<P>Thus did he, for a meer trifle, embarrass the
woman <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o whom he professes the most unlimited
love, and whose principles he pretends to hold in
<PB N="217" REF="222"/>
the utmost veneration. Indeed his confidence in
my integrity is not without foundation; for many
wives, with one half of my provocation, would
have ruined him to all intents and purposes;
whereas, notwithstanding all the extraordinary
expences, to which I have been exposed by his
continual persecution, he never paid a shilling on
my account, except one thousand pounds, ex∣clusive
of the small allowance which was my
due. In a word, so much time elapsed before
my lord could prevail upon himself to advance
the bare four hundred, that I was involved in
fresh difficulties, from which I found it impossible
to extricate myself: and though I had occasion
to write a letter to my benefactor lord—, in
which I expressed my acknowledgment for past
favours, I could not venture to sollicit m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re;
even when I was encouraged by a very obliging
answer, wherein he declared, that the good qua∣lities
of my mind and heart, would bind him to
me in friendship for ever.</P>
<P>While I ruminated on my uncomfortable situa∣tion,
which would neither permit me to return
to England, nor to stay much longer where I
was, a young Englishman of immense fortune
took Paris in his way from Italy, accompanied
by a most agreeable Scotchman of very good
sense and great vivacity. It was my good or ill
fortune to become acquainted with these gentle∣m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,
who having seen me at the opera, expressed
a desire of being known to me, and accordingly
favoured me with a visit one afternoon, when the
brisk North Briton ingrossed the whole conversa∣tion;
while the other seemed fearful and diffident
even to a degree of bashfulness, through which,
however, I could discern a delicate sensibility
<PB N="218" REF="223"/>
and uncommon understanding: there was in his
person (which was very agreeable) as well as in
his behaviour, a certain <HI>naivetè</HI> that was very
pleasing; and at this first interview, we relished
each other's company so well, that a sort of inti∣macy
immediately commenced, and was car∣ried
on in a succession of parties of pleasure, in
the course of which I found him fraught with all
the tenderness and sentiment that render the
heart susceptible of the most refined love; a dis∣position
that immediately made me partial to him,
while it subjected his own heart to all the violent
impressions of a passion, which I little imagined
our correspondence would have produced.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, I was far from being displeased
with my conquest, because his person and qualifi∣cations,
as well as his manner of address, were
very much to my liking, and recommended him
in a particular manner to my affection. Indeed,
he made a greater progress in my heart than I
myself suspected; for there was something con∣genial
in our souls, which from our first meeting
I believe had attracted us (unknown to ourselves)
under the notions of friendship and regard, and
now disclosed itself in the most passionate love.</P>
<P>I li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tened to his addresses, and we were truly
happy. His attachment was the quintessence of
tenderness and sincerity, while his generosity
knew no bound. Not contented with having
paid twelve hundred pounds on my account, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n
the space of one fortnight, he would have loaded
me with present after present, had not I abso∣lutely
re used to accept such expensive marks of
his munificence. I was even morti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied at those
instances of his liberality, which my situation
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to receive, left, being but little
<PB N="219" REF="224"/>
acquainted with my disposition, he should suspect
me of being interested in my love, and judge
my conduct by the malicious reports of common
same, which (he afterwards owned) had at first
obtained such credit with him, that he believed
our mutual attachment would not be of long du∣ration.
But, in this particular, he was soon unde∣ceived:
his heart, though naturally adapted for
the melting passion, had hitherto escaped un∣touched
by all the ladies of Italy and France;
and therefore the first impressions were the more
deeply fixed. As he was unpractised in the ways
of common gallantry and deceit, the striking
simplicity in his character was the more likely to
engage the heart of one who knew the perfidy
of the world, and despised all the farce and bom∣bast
of fashionable profession, which I had always
considered as the phrase of vanity and ostenta∣tion,
rather than the genuine language of love.
Besides, gratitude had a considerable share in aug∣menting
my affection, which manifested itself in
such a warm, cordial, artless manner, as in∣creased
his esteem, and rivetted his attachment;
for he could easily perceive, from the whole te∣nour
of my conduct, that my breast was an utter
stranger to crast and dissimulation: yet I was at
first fearful of contracting any engagement with
him, because, being younger than me, he might
be the more apt to change, and the world might
be malicious enough to suppose I had practised
upon his inexperience; but, conscious of my
own integrity, I s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nder at defiance, trusting
to my own behaviour, and his natural probity,
for the continuance of his love. Though we
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve together in the same house, the
greatest part of our time was spent in each other's
<PB N="220" REF="225"/>
company; we dined and supped at the same ta∣ble,
frequented public places, went upon parties
to the country, and never parted, but for a few
hours in the night, which we passed in the utmost
impatience to meet again.</P>
<P>In this agreeable manner did the days roll on,
when my felicity was interrupted by a fit of jea∣lousy
with which I happened to be seized, I had
contracted an acquaintance with a young married
lady, who, though her personal attractions were
but slender, was, upon the whole, an agreeable,
chearful, good-natured companion, with a little
dash of the coquette in her composition. This
woman being in very indigent circumstances, oc∣casioned
by some losses her husband had sustained,
no sooner had an opportunity of seeing and con∣versing
with my lover, than she formed the de∣sign
of making a conquest of him. I should
have forgiven her for this scheme, whatever
pangs it might have cost <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/> I believed it
the effect of real passion; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut I knew her too
well, to suppose her heart was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of
love, and accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it. In the execu∣tion
of her plan, she <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> nothing which
she thought capable <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his attention.
She took al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>portunities of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> near him at

My bl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at her though my pride, for
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me time, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> me to conceal my un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>asiness:
till at length <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> became so arrogant
and gross, that I couldn<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ger suppress my in∣dignation,
and one day told my lover, that I
would immediately renounce his correspondence.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="226"/>
He was greatly alarmed at this unexpected de∣claration;
and when he understood the cause of
it, assured me, that for the future he would ne∣ver
exchange one word with her. Satisfied with
this mark of his sincerity and regard, I released
him <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom this promise, which he could not pos∣sibly
keep, while she and I lived upon any terms;
and we continued to visit each other as usual,
though she still persisted in her endeavours to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ival me in his affection, and contracted an inti∣macy
with his companion, who seemed to enter∣tain
a passion for her, that she might have the
more frequent opportunities of being among us;
for she had no objection against favouring the
addresses of both. One evening, I remember,
we set out in my coach for the opera; and in the
way, this inamorata was so busy with her feet,
that I was incensed at her behaviour; and when
we arrived at the place, refused to alight; but, set∣ting
them down, declared my intention of return∣ing
home immediately. She was so much pleased
with this intimation, that she could not conceal the
joy she felt at the thoughts of conversing with
him, uninterrupted by my presence; an oppor∣tunity
with which I had never favoured her be∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re.
This open exultation increased my anger
and anxiety: I went home; but, being still tor∣tured
with the reflection of having left them to∣gether,
adjusted myself in the glass, though I
was too angry to take notice of my own figure,
and without farther delay returned to the opera.</P>
<P>Having inquired for the box in which they sat,
I took possession of one that fronted them, and
reconnoitring them, without being perceived,
had the satisfaction of seeing him removed to as
great a distance from her as the place would per∣mit,
<PB N="222" REF="227"/>
and his head turned another way. Com∣posed
by this examination, I joined them with∣out
further scruple, when my young gentleman
expressed great joy at my appearance, and told
me he was determined to have left the entertain∣ment,
and come in quest of me, had not I re∣turned
at that instant.</P>
<P>In our way homewards, my rival repeated her
usual hints, and with her large hoop almost over∣shadowed
my lover from my view: upon which
my jealousy and wrath recurred with such vio∣lence,
that I pulled the string, as a signal for the
coachman to stop, with a view of getting out,
and going home afoot; a step which would have
afforded a new spectacle to the people of Paris,
But I reflected, in a moment, upon the folly of
such a resolution, and soon recollected myself,
by calling my pride to my assistance. I deter∣mined,
however, that she should act no more
scenes of this kind in my presence, and that same
night insisted upon my lover's dropping all inter∣course
and connexion with this tormentor. He
very chearfully complied with my desire, and was
even glad of an occasion to break off his acquaint∣ance
with a person about whom I had plagued
him so much.</P>
<P>Thus was I freed from the persecution of one
of those creatures, who, tho' of little conse∣quence
in themselves, are yet the pests of so∣ciety,
and find means to destroy that harmony
which reigns between two lovers, by the intru∣sion
of a loose appetite, void of all sensibility and
discretion: having no feeling themselves, they
cannot sympathize with that of other people, and
do mischief out of meer wantonness.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="228"/>
My lover being obliged to go to England, had
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttled me in a genteel house in Paris, with a
view of returning when his affairs should be ad∣justed;
but when the time of his departure ap∣proached,
he began to be uneasy at the prospect
of separation, and, in order to alleviate his
anxiety, desired me to accompany him to Ca∣lais,
where we stayed together three or four
days, during which the dread of parting became
more and more intense: so that we determined
upon my following him into England, by the
first opportunity, where I should live altogether
<HI>incog,</HI> that I might be concealed from the inqui∣ries
and attempts of my lord. Even after this
resolution was fixed, we parted with all the ago∣nies
of lovers who despair of ever meeting again;
and the wind blowing very high after he had im∣barked,
increased my fears. But by the return
or the packet-boat, I was blessed with the report
of his being safe arrived in England, and had the
satisfaction of perusing his letters by every post.</P>
<P>My admirer being thus detached from me, my
thoughts were intirely employed in concerting
some private method of conveying myself to him.
As I would not trust myself in the common
packet, for fear of being discovered, after hav∣ing
revolved divers schemes, I determined to trans∣port
myself in one of the Dutch fishing-boats,
tho' I knew the passage would be hazardous;
but, in a case of such interesting concern, I over∣looked
all danger and inconvenience. Before I
put this resolution in practice, I was so fortunate
as to hear of a small English vessel that arrived at
Calais with a prisoner of war, in which I em∣barked
with my companion, and another lady,
who lived with me for some time afterwards;
<PB N="224" REF="229"/>
and when we came on board, discovered that the
ship was no other than a light collier, and that
her whole company amounted to no more than
three men. Nevertheless, tho' the sea was to
rough, and the weather so unpromising, that no
other boat would venture to put to sea. we set
sail, and between two storms, in about three
hours arrived in safety at Dover.</P>
<P>From hence my first companion went to her
friends, in the stage coach, while the other lady
and I hired an open post-chaise (tho' it snowed
very hard) and without any accident performed
our journey to London, where I met with my
lover, who flew to my arms in all the transports
of impatient joy; and, doubtless, I deserved his
affection, for the hardships, perils, and difficul∣ties
I had undergone to be with him; for I never
scrupled to undertake any thing practicable, in
order to demonstrate the sincerity of what I pro∣fessed.</P>
<P>In consequence of our plan, I assumed a ficti∣tious
name, and never appeared in publick, be∣ing
fully satisfied and happy in the company and
conversation of the man I loved; and when he
went into the country, contented myself with
his correspondence, which he punctually main∣ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned,
in a series of letters equally, sensible, sin∣ce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e
and affectionate.</P>
<P>Upon his return to town for the remainder of
the season, he devoted the greatest part of his
time to our mutual enjoyment; left me with re∣luctance,
when he was called away by indispen∣sible
business, and the civility which was due to his
acquaintance, and very seldom went to any place of
publick ent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rtainment, because I could not accom∣pany
and share with him in the diversion: nay,
<PB N="225" REF="230"/>
so much did I ingross his attention, that one even∣ing,
after he had been teized into an agreement
of meeting some friends at a play, he went thi∣ther
precisely at the appointed hour, and as they
did not arrive punctually at the very minute, he re∣turned
to me immediately, as much rejoiced at his
escape as if he had met with some signal deliverance.
Nor was his constancy inferior to the ardour of
his love: we went once together to a ball in the
Hay-market, where, in the midst of a thousand
fine women, whose charms were inhanced by the
peculiarity of the dresses they wore, he remained
unthaken, unseduced, preserving his attachment
for me, in spite of all temptation.</P>
<P>In the summer he provided me with a house in
the neighbourhood of his own; but the accom∣modations
being bad, and that country affording
no other place fit for my residence, he brought
me home to his own seat, and by that step raised
an universal clamour, tho' I saw no company,
and led such a solitary life, that nothing but ex∣cessive
love could have supported my spirits: not
but that he gave me as much of his time as he
could possibly spare from the necessary duties of
paying and receiving visits, together with the
avocations of hunting, and other country amuse∣ments,
which I could not partake. Formerly,
indeed, I used to hunt and shoot, but I had left
off both; so that I was now reduced to the alter∣native
of reading and walking by myself: but,
<HI>Love made up for all deficiencies to me, who think
nothing else worth the living for!—Had I been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a partner for l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe, who could have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sincerely, and inspired me with a mutual
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>me, I would have asked no more of fate. Inte∣rest
and ambition have no share in my composition;
<PB N="226" REF="231"/>
love which is pleasure, or pleasure which is love,
makes up the whole. A heart so disposed cannot be
devoid of other good qualities; it must be subject to
the impressions of humanity and benevolence, and
enemy to nothing but itself.</HI> This you will give me
leave to affirm, in justice to myself, as I have
frankly owned my failings and misconduct.</P>
<P>Towards the end of summer my heart was a
little alarmed by a report that prevailed, of my
lover's being actually engaged in a treaty of mar∣riage:
however, I gave little credit to this ru∣mour,
till I was obliged to go to town about
business, and there I heard the same information
confidently affirmed. Tho' I still considered it
as a vague surmise, I wrote to him an account of
what I had heard; and in his answer, which is
still in my possession, he assured me, with re∣peated
vows and protestations, that the report
was altogether false. Satisfied with this declara∣tion,
I returned to his house; and tho' the tale
was incessantly thundered in my ears, still be∣lieved
it void of all foundation, till my suspicion
was awaked by a very inconsiderable circum∣stance.</P>
<P>One day, on his return from hunting, I per∣ceived
he had a very fine pair of Dresden ruffles
on his shirt, which I could not suppose he would
wear at such a rustic exercise; and therefore my
fears immediately took the alarm. When I
questioned him about this particular of his dress,
his colour changed; and tho' he attempted to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lude my suspicion, by imputing it to a mistake
of his servant, I could not rest satisfied with this
account of the matter, but inquired into the
truth with such eagerness and penetration, that
he could not deny he had been to make a visit;
<PB N="227" REF="232"/>
and, by degrees, I even extorted from him a con∣fession,
that he had engaged himself farther than
he ought to have proceeded, without making me
acquainted with his design, tho' he endeavoured
to excuse his conduct, and pacify my displeasure,
by saying that the affair would not be brought to
bear for a great while, and perhaps might never
come to a determination: but he was in great
confusion, and indeed hardly knew what he
said.</P>
<P>I would have quitted his house that moment,
had not he, before-hand, obtained a promise that
I would take no rash resolution of that kind, and
put it out of my power to procure any method of
conveyance by which I could make my retreat.
I gave no vent to reproaches, and only upbraid∣ed
him with his having permitted me to return
in ignorance to the country, after I was once
fairly gone: upon which he swore that he could
not bear the thoughts of parting with me. This
declaration was a mystery at that time, but I
have been since so fully satisfied of his reasons
for his conduct, that I heartily acquit him of all
injustice to me. And indeed, it is my sincere
opinion, that if ever young man deserved to be
happy, he is certainly intitled to that privi∣lege;
and, if I may be allowed to judge, has
an heart susceptible of the most refined enjoy∣ment.</P>
<P>The violence of the grief and consternation
which I suffered from this stroke, having a little
subsided, I deliberated with myself about the
measures I should take, and determined to leave
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> house some day when he should be abroad. I
<PB N="228" REF="233"/>
was encouraged in this resolution by the advice of
our Scotch friend, who came about this time
from London, on a visit to his fellow-traveller:
we thought such an abrupt departure would be
less shocking than to stay and take a formal leave
of my lover, whose heart was of such a delicate
frame, that after I told him I should one day
withdraw myself, in his absence, he never came
home from the chace, or any other avocation,
without trembling with apprehension that I had
escaped.</P>
<P>After he had been some time accustomed to
these fears by my previous intimation, I at length
decamped, in good earnest, tho' my heart aked
upon the occasion, because I left him loving and
beloved; for his affection was evident, notwith∣standing
the step he had taken, by the advice and
importunity of all his relations, who laid a dis∣agreeable
restraint upon his inclinations, while
they consulted his interest in every other parti∣cular.</P>
<P>While I halted in the next great town, until
I could be supplied with fresh horses, I was visited
by a gentleman who had been formerly intimate
with my lover; but a breach had happened in
their friendship, and he now came to complain
of the treatment he had received. Perceiving
that I was not in a humour to listen to his story,
he shifted the conversation to my own, and ob∣served,
that I had been extremely ill used. I
told him I was of a different opinion: that it
was not only just, but expedient, that a young
man of Mr.—'s fortune should think of
making some alliance to strengthen and support
<PB N="229" REF="234"/>
the interest of his family; and that I had no∣thing
to accuse him of but his letting me remain
so long in ignorance of his intention. He then
gave me to understand, that I was still ignorant
of a great part of the ill usage I had received, af∣firming,
that while I lived in his house, he had
amused himself with all the common women in
that town, to some of whom this gentleman
had personally introduced him.</P>
<P>At first, I could not believe this imputation;
but he supported his assertions with so many con∣vincing
circumstances, that I could no longer
doubt the truth of them; and I felt so much re∣sentment,
that my love vanished immediately
into air. Instead of proceeding in my journey to
London, I went back a considerable way, and
sent a message, desiring to see him in a little
house, about mid way between his own habita∣tion
and the town from whence I came. He
obeyed my summons, and appeared at the place
appointed, where I reproached him with great
bitterness. He pleaded guilty to the charge, so
far as acknowledging that he had corresponded
with other women lately, in order to get the bet∣ter
of his affection for me, but the experiment
had failed, and he found that he should be for
ever miserable.</P>
<P>I did not look upon this candid confession as a
sufficient atonement for his past dissimulation,
and, in the sharpness of my revenge, demanded
a settlement, which he peremptorily refused; so
that, for the present, we held each other in the
utmost contempt. Indeed, I afterwards despised
myself for my condescension, which was owing
to the advice of my companion, supported and
inflamed by the spirit of resentment. Neverthe∣less,
<PB N="230" REF="235"/>
he begged that I would return to his house,
or stay all night where I was; but I was deaf to
his intreaties, and, after a great deal of ironi∣cal
civility on my side, I took my leave, and
went away; yet, before I set out, I looked back,
and saw him on horseback, with such an air of
simplicity and truth, as called up a profound sigh,
notwithstanding all that had passed in our con∣versation.</P>
<P>Upon my arrival in London, I took lodgings
in Leicester-Fields, and answered a letter which
I had some months before received from my lord;
telling him, that I would go home to him, with∣out
stipulating for any terms, to try what effect
my confidence would have upon his generosity.
He readily embraced the offer, and took an house
in St. James's street, where I proposed to com∣ply
with his humour in every thing that was
consistent with my own peace and tranquil∣lity.</P>
<P>Mean while, my lover passed his time very
disagreeably in the country, with his friend, of
whom (it seems) he had conceived some jealousy,
which was increased by a letter I wrote to that
gentleman, till he was made acquainted with the
contents, which he read over forty times; and
then his passion breaking out with more violence
than ever, he not only expressed his feeling, in
an epistle which I immediately received, but
when he came to town, suffered such agonies of
despair as I had never seen before, except in lord
B—. It was then in my power to have taken
ample revenge upon him, as well as upon my
insolent rival, who had insisted upon my leaving
his house, in a very abrupt manner, tho' he ab∣solutely
refused to gratify her malice; for he was
<PB N="231" REF="236"/>
now disposed to do any thing for my satisfaction:
but I knew his worth, and had too much regard
for his reputation to advise him to act incon∣sistent
with his honour.</P>
<P>About this time, many tender meetings and
sorrowful partings happened between us, till the
marriage-knot was tied, when he sent me a
bank-note for a thousand pounds, by way of spe∣cimen
(as he called it) of his friendship, and of
what he would do for me, should I ever want
his assistance. This mark of his generosity I re∣ceived
in a most tender billet, which I shall never
part with, together with his picture set in dia∣monds.</P>
<P>I now employed my thoughts in keeping mea∣sures
with my lord; we lay in the same apart∣ment,
and for the first four or five months I nei∣ther
dined nor supped abroad, above twice; and
then he knew where I was, and approved of my
company. But all this complacency and cir∣cumspection
had no effect upon his temper,
which remained as capricious and dissatisfied as
ever. Nay, to such a provoking degree did this
unhappy humour prevail, that one day, in the
presence of his lawyer, he harrangued upon my
misconduct since our last re-union; and very
freely affirmed, that every step I had taken was
diametrically opposite to his will.</P>
<P>Conscious of the pains I had been at to please
him, I was so incensed at these unjust invectives,
that starting up, I told him he was a little dirty
fellow; and would have left the house imme∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ately,
had not his lawyer, and others who
were in the next room, interposed, and by dint
of argument and importunity diverted me from
my purpose. By the bye, I have been informed
<PB N="232" REF="237"/>
by a person of rank, that my lord discovered ex∣actly
the same disposition in his father's life-time,
and only changes the subject of his complaint
from the word <HI>father</HI> to that of <HI>wife.</HI> Indeed
he takes all opportunities of plaguing my dear
parent, as he has just sagacity enough to know,
that this is the most effectual way he can take
to distress me.</P>
<P>After repeated trials, I have given up all hopes
of making him happy, or of finding myself easy
in my situation; and live with him at present to
avoid a greater inconvenience. Not that his ill∣nature
is all the grievance of which I complain:
exclusive of the personal disgust I entertain for
him, his folly is of that species which disobliges
rather than diverts, and his vanity and affecta∣tion
altogether intolerable; for he actually be∣lieves
himself, or at least would impose himself
upon mankind, as a pattern in gallantry and
taste; and, in point of business, a person of in∣finite
sagacity and penetration: but the most ri∣diculous
part of his character is his pretended ta∣lent
for politics, in which he so deeply concerns
himself, that he has dismissed many a good ser∣vant,
because he suspected him of having wrong
connexions; a theme upon which he has often
quarrelled with me, even almost to parting, ac∣cusing
me of holding correspondence with the
earls of B—and C—, and Mr. H—V—tho' I
never had the least acquaintance with any of these
gentlemen, except the earl of C—, to whom I
have not spoke for these ten years past.</P>
<P>In short, I have often been at a loss to know,
whether he was more mad or malicious in those
sits of enthusiasm, wherein he seemed transport∣ed
with zeal for the commonwealth, and tor∣mented
<PB N="233" REF="238"/>
me with his admonitions, out of all
temper and patience. At length, however, I
contrived an expedient which freed me from
these troublesome expostulations, and silenced
him effectually on the score of politicks. This
was no other than an open avowal of being con∣nected
with all those people whom I have nam∣ed.
Indeed, I knew him too well to believe
there was any thing solid in his intention or pro∣fessions,
even when he carried them so far as to
demand a private audience of the K—, in order
to communicate a scheme for suppressing the re∣bellion;
and that being denied, sollicited the
duke of D—'s interest, for permission to raise
and head a regiment of Kentish smugglers: nay,
to such a pitch did his loyalty soar, that he pur∣chased
a firelock of particular mechanism, cal∣culated
for the safety of the bearer, in case he
had been placed centinel at his majesty's door;
and kept his horses ready caparisoned, with a
view of attending his sovereign to the field. Not∣withstanding
all these pompous preparations, had
he been put to the proof, he would have insal∣libly
crept out of his engagements, thro' some
sneaking evasion, his imagination being very fer∣tile
in such saving pretences. Yet he will talk
sometimes so servently, and even sensibly, on
the subject, that a stranger would mistake him
for a man of understanding, and determined zeal
for the good of his country.</P>
<P>Since my last return to his house, that act of
parliament passed, by which he was enabled to
pay his debts, and among the rest, a thousand
pounds of my contracting, the only burden of
that kind I ever intailed upon him, exclusive of
my pin-money, which was never regularly paid;
<PB N="234" REF="239"/>
nor would he have been subject to this, had he
not, by his persecution and pursuit, exposed me
to an extraordinary expence. I have also had it
in my power to reward some of my faithful Abi∣gails;
in particular, to relieve from extreme di∣stress
that maid to whom (as I have already ob∣served)
lord B—granted an annuity, which she
had sold: so that she was reduced to the most
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bject poverty, and I found her in a dismal hole,
with two infants, perishing for want; a spectacle
which drew tears from my eyes, and indeed
could not but make a deep impression upon an
heart like mine, which the misery of my fellow-creatures
never failed to melt.</P>
<P>Nor did I, upon this occasion, forget the at∣tachment
and fidelity of my other woman Mrs.
S—, who hearing I was robbed in my passage
thro' Flanders, had generously relinquished the
allowance I had settled upon her at parting. The
exercise of such acts of humanity and benevo∣lence,
and the pleasure of seeing my dear and
tender parent often, in some measure alleviate
the chagrin to which I am subject, from the dis∣agreeable
disposition of my lord, who, consistent
with his former inconsistency, upon our last re∣conciliation
chearfully agreed to a proposal I
made of having concerts in the house, and even
approved of the scheme with marks of particular
satisfaction: but before one half of the winter
was expired, he found means to banish all the
company, beginning with lord R—B—, who,
as he walked up stairs one evening, was stopped
by a sootman, who plainly told him he had or∣ders
to say to him in particular, that his lordship
was not at home: yet the very next day perceiv∣ing
that nobleman and me walking together in
the park, he joined us with an air of alacrity, as
<PB N="235" REF="240"/>
if no such thing had happened, and even be∣haved
to lord R—with the most sawning
complaisance. His deportment was equally ab∣surd
and impertinent to the rest of our friends,
who forsook us gradually, being tired of main∣taining
any friendly communication with such a
disagreeable composition of ignorance and arro∣gance.
For my own part, I look upon him as
utterly incorrigible; and as fate hath subjected
me to his power, endeavour to make the bitter
draught go down, by detaching myself, as much
as possible, from the supposition that there is any
such existence upon earth. Indeed, if I had not
fatal experience of the contrary, I should be apt
to believe that such a character is not to be found
among the sons of men; because his conduct is
altogether unaccountable by the known rules
and maxims of life, and falls intirely under the
poet's observation, when he says.</P>
<LG>
<L>Tis true, no meaning puzzles more than wit.</L>
</LG>
<P>Her ladyship having thus concluded her story,
to the entertainment of the company, and the
admiration of Peregrine, who expressed his asto∣nishment
at the variety of adventure she had un∣dergone,
which was such as he thou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht sufficient
to destroy the most hardy and robust constitution,
and therefore infinitely more than enough to
overwhelm one of her delicate frame; one of the
gentlemen present, roundly taxed her with want
of candour, in suppressing some circumstances of
her life, which he thought essential in the consi∣deration
of her character.</P>
<P>She reddened at this peremptory charge, which
had an evident effect upon the countenances of
the whole audience, when the accuser proceeded
<PB N="236" REF="241"/>
to explain his imputation, by observing, that, in
the course of her narration, she had omitted to
mention a thousand acts of uncommon charity,
of which he himself knew her to b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> guilty; that
she had concealed a great many advantageous
proposals of marriage, which she might have
accepted, before she was engaged; that she
had not spoke one word of her first husband's
debts, which, to his certain knowledge, she had
paid out of her own privy purse, after her second
marriage, and on that account received the
thanks of lord W—'s elder brother, who,
though he had undertaken to discharge them, de∣layed
the execution of his purpose longer than
she thought they should remain unpaid: and that,
in relating her inducements for leaving Mr. S—,
(whether out of forgetfulness, or from tender∣ness
to a lover once so dear to her, he would not
pretend to say) she had omitted a very cogent
motive for her own conduct; for as he had first
courted her favour in her rising fortune, and left
her in its decline, she could not avoid reflecting,
that, after this precipitate re-engagement, when
the first transports of their meeting were over,
he would again act the same conduct, as soon as
her tranquillity should be disturbed by the perse∣cution
of her lord.</P>
<P>The company were agreeably undeceived by
this explanation; which her ladyship acknow∣ledged
in very polite terms, as a compliment
equally genteel and unexpected: and our hero,
after having testified the sense he had of her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omplaisance and condescension, in regaling him
with such a mark of her confidence and esteem,
took his leave, and went home in a state of
confusion and perplexity; for, from the cir∣cumstances
of the tale he had heard, he plainly
<PB N="237" REF="242"/>
perceived, that her ladyship's heart was too de∣licate
to receive such incense, as he, in the ca∣pacity
of an admirer, could at present pay; be∣cause,
though he had in some measure abridged
the empire of Emilia in his own breast, it was
not in his power to restrain it so effectually, but
that it would interfere with any other sovereign
whom his thoughts should adopt: and, unless
lady—could ingross his whole love, time
and attention, he foresaw, that it would be
impossible for him to support the passion which
he might have the good fortune to inspire. He
was, moreover, deterred from declaring his love,
by the fate of her former admirers, who seemed
to have been wound up to a degree of enthu∣siasm,
that looked more like the effect of in∣chantment,
than the inspiration of human at∣tractions;
an extasy of passion which he durst
not venture to undergo; therefore resolved to
combat with the impressions he had already re∣ceived,
and, if possible, cultivate her friendship
without soliciting her affection: but, before he
could fix upon this determination, he desired to
know the predicament in which he stood in her
opinion; and by the intelligence of Crabtree, ob∣tained
in the usual manner, understood that her
sentiments of him were very favourable, though
without the least tincture of love. He would have
been transported with joy, had her thoughts of
him been of a more tender texture; though his
reason was better pleased with the information he
received; in consequence of which, he mustered
up the ideas of his first passion, and set them in
opposition to those of this new and dangerous at∣tachment;
by which means, he kept the balance
<HI>in equilibrio,</HI> and his bosom tolerably quiet.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. LXXXIX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine amuses his imagination, by slight incur∣sions
upon the territory of vice and folly; reforms
a back-sliding brother, and sends a celebrated
sharper into exile.</HEAD>
<P>HIS heart being thus, as it were, suspended
between two objects that lessened the force
of each other's attraction, he took this op∣portunity
of enjoying some respite, and for the
present detached his sentiments from both; re∣solving
to indulge himself in the exercise of that
practical sative, which was so agreeable and pe∣culiar
to his disposition. In this laudable determi∣nation
he was confirmed by the repeated sugge∣stions
of his friend Cadwallader, who taxed him
with letting his talents rust in indolence, and sti∣mulated
his natural vivacity, with a succession of
fresh discoveries in the world of scandal.</P>
<P>Thus reinforced, they took the field, and per∣formed
various exploits, to the mortification,
astonishment and dismay of all those coxcombs,
whether male or female, sierce or feeble, insolent
or tame, that hang like tatters on the skirts of
gallantry, and bring the fashion into disgrace.
As I might trespass upon the patience of the rea∣der,
in giving a minute det<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>l of each adventure
of this kind which they atchieved, I shall content
myself with relating two only, to which indeed
all the rest bore s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me resemblance.</P>
<P>Peregrine's intelligencer, who (as we have al∣ready
observed) was a privileged person in all
parties, happened one morning to breakfast with
a fort of a great man, who, with a large stock
<PB N="239" REF="244"/>
of timorous superstition and exterior piety, had
at bottom a spice of carnality, which all his re∣ligion
could not extinguish. Among the rest of
his dependants, there was a certain favourite,
who by the most assiduous attention to his hu∣mour,
in a course of artful flattery and servile
complaisance, had insinuated himself so far into
his confidence and esteem, that he now acted in
the capacity of his counsellor and director, both
in his spiritual and temporal concerns.</P>
<P>This cunning parasite having discovered his
patron's infirmity, began to be afraid, that in the
instigations of the flesh, he might be tempted to
employ some other agent for the gratification of
his appetite: and foreseeing that any minister of
this kind would infallibly prove a dangerous rival
to him, in the good graces of his master, he re∣solved
to anticipate the misfortune, and, with his
other offices, monopolize the functions of a Mer∣cury,
for which his talents were perfectly well
adapted. But this was not the whole of his task;
he knew there were certain qualms and scruples
of conscience to be removed, as well as other
motives of shyness and distrust, which he durst
not leave to the operation of his friend's own de∣sires,
lest he should choose some other confident;
he therefore observed the different seasons of his
constitution, and culled the proper opportunities
of expressing a relaxation in his sentiments of cha∣stity;
which being gratefully received, he pro∣ceeded
in the work of conversion, already half
effected by his patron's own passions; and in
conclusion, sound a willing dame to quench this
fire that scorched his vitals. He had overnight
obtained her consent, and the particulars of their
meeting were adjusted, in presence of Cadwal∣lader,
<PB N="240" REF="245"/>
who gave his associate to understand that,
with a view of keeping the rendezvous secret
and mysterious, as well as of saving the lovers
that mutual confusion which the light must have
produced, the scene of their interview was laid
in a summer-house, that stood at the end of his
garden, to which the lady and her conductor
would be admitted in the dark, through a back-door
that should be left open for the purpose.
Peregrine being made acquainted with these par∣ticulars,
together with the hour of assignation,
ordered Pipes to purchase a live calf, and carried
it in a sack, about the twilight, to the back∣garden-door,
which our hero entered without he∣sitation,
disposing himself and his attendants in a
dark alcove immediately under the summer-house,
where (without disengaging the animal from its
covering) he besmeared its front with liquid
phosphorus, and directed Tom to unveil, and
present it to the company at their approach,
while he himself absconded behind a pillar, from
whence he could view the entertainment. They
had continued a whole hour in this situation,
when they perceived by star-light, three persons
enter the postern, and advance towards the place
where they lay; upon which, Pipes began to dis∣entangle
his charge, that he might be ready to
play it off at the proper time; but, as he was not
very expert in this business, the calf finding itself
disengaged from its confinement, sprung all of a
sudden out of his hands, and running directly for∣wards,
encountered those that approached, and
as it passed them, uttered a loud <HI>Baa.</HI></P>
<P>The gallant, whose passions were exalted to a
pitch of enthusiasm, as susceptible of religious
horror as of love, seeing such an apparition, when
<PB N="241" REF="246"/>
he was at the point of indulging a criminal appe∣tite,
and hearing the dreadful cry, accompanied
with the terrible word <HI>damnation,</HI> which Pipes,
in his peculiar tone, exclaimed from the alcove,
when the animal made its escape; he was seized
with consternation and remorse, and falling upon
his face, lay in all the agonies of terror, believing
himself warned by a particular message from
above. His trusty squire, who was not quite so
visionary, recollecting himself from the surprize
he had suffered at the first appearance of such a
glaring phaenomenon, which had also such an ef∣fect
upon the lady, that she ran out into the
fields, screaming all the way: I say, he no sooner
recovered the faculty of reflection, which this ac∣cident
had for some minutes taken away, than
he observed his patron's prostration; and guessing
the condition of his thoughts, resolved to profit
by his sagacity. He accordingly laid himself
gently down upon the cold walk, and lay very
quietly, till the lover, having in a faultring voice
called thrice upon his name, without being fa∣voured
with an answer, raised himself up, and
coming to the spot, shook him by the arm; upon
which he seemed to wake from his trance, and in
a most penitent tone pronounced a very pious
ejaculation, which confirmed the opinion of his
principal, who asked him with fear and trembling,
if he had heard the voice and seen the light. Be∣ing
an excellent actor, he replied with all the
marks of amazement, that he was struck blind
with a gush of light, far exceeding that of the
sun at noon, and his ears appalled with a voice,
like the found of many waters, denouncing dam∣nation
to those who obey the lusts of the flesh.</P>
<P><PB N="242" REF="247"/>
The converted lover, though he was not sen∣sible
of such extraordinary circumstances of visi∣tation,
implicitely believed every tittle of his ac∣count,
imputing the difference of his own per∣ception
to the weakness of his organs, which
were sooner disturbed than those of his purveyor.
He therefore proposed, that they should adjourn
to the chamber which had been destined for the
scene of his transgression, and with sorrow and
contrition ask pardon of heaven for his intended
offence, acknowledging at the same time, the
seasonable and salutary interposition of providence.
This duty was accordingly performed, after they
had searched in vain for the nymph, who (the
squire seemed to think) was conveyed by some su∣pernatural
means from the garden; for he said,
as he lay intranced upon the ground, he heard a
rattling like the chariots of Aminadab, and the
shrieks of the young woman gradually sinking in
a distant cadence, as if she had been transported
through the air.</P>
<P>As this pair of penitents walked up stairs to
the summer-house, the patron, in an extasy
of faith, pronounced, “After this tremen∣dous
scene, who can be so incredulous, so
dead to all conviction, as to doubt the miracle
of the loaves and fishes, or the amazing cir∣cumstances
that attended the conversion of St.
Paul?” While they were employed in the ex∣ercise
of their devotion, our hero and his atten∣dant
retired by the back-door, which opened in∣to
the fields; and while Pipes went in pursuit of
his calf, which had taken shelter under the wall,
his master proceeded forwards to the place from
whence he had come, where he had agreed to
meet Cadwallader, and communicate the success
<PB N="243" REF="248"/>
of his enterprize, with which he was perfectly
well pleased. In crossing the field that lay be∣twixt
him and that part of the town for which
he was bound, he chanced to pass by a heap of
wood, upon which he perceived a woman, tole∣rably
well dressed, sitting, and holding a smel∣ling-bottle
to her nose. He immediately guessed
her to be the lady whom he had interrupted in
her assignation; and thinking it was incumbent
upon him to make some atonement for the in∣jury
he had done, he accosted her with great po∣liteness
and respect, telling her, he presumed,
from her being in such a solitary place, at such an
hour, that she had met with some misfortune;
and that, if she would put herself under his pro∣tection,
he would defend her from any farther
insult.</P>
<P>His conjecture was right; this was the indi∣vidual
inamorata who had fled from the garden,
and who was so terrified at the vision, the mean∣ing
of which she could not comprehend, that
she found herself unable to proceed farther home∣wards,
and sat down on a log of wood, to enjoy
a little pause of rest, and endeavour to recollect
her dissipated spirits. She had not yet got the
better of her apprehension, which was rather in∣creased
by the darkness of the night and the lone∣liness
of the place; so that she, without scruple,
emb<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aced the offer of a person who behaved with
s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ch gentle address: and as she was enervated by
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar, she carefully supported her in walking, with
his arm round her waist, encouraging her all the
way with assurances of safety, and expressing his
curiosity to know the adventure, in consequence
of which she had occasion for assistance. She
spoke very little during her passage through the
<PB N="244" REF="249"/>
field, because, notwithstanding his professions and
appearance, he was still a stranger; and therefore
she could not be altogether easy, while she
thought herself absolutely in his power: but,
when they entered the town, and mingled with
the concourse of people that pass and repass
through all the streets of this metropolis, her dif∣fidence
intirely vanished, and her conversation
became altogether unreserved.</P>
<P>The remembrance of what had discomposed
her so much in the garden, now afforded subject
for her mirth; and when her conductor still re∣peated
his desire of information, she could not help
laughing heartily, at the circumstances which his
questions recalled. Encouraged by this mani∣festation
of good humour, he observed, that as
her spirits were exhausted by the fatigue and dis∣quite
she had undergone, it would be impossible
for her to walk much farther, and begg'd she
would step with him into the next tavern, where
they might send for an hackney-coach or chair,
in which she would be conveyed to her own lodg∣ing.
After much intreaty, she consented to his
proposal; and he had the pleasure to see, that she
was a very handsome young woman, about the
age of eighteen.</P>
<P>The joy he felt at this discovery lightened in
his eyes; nor was she able to conceal a certain
alacrity and satisfaction that appeared in her
countenance, when she obtained a distinct view
of her protector's person. In short, she was pre∣vailed
upon to drink a glass of wine; and Pere∣grine
presuming upon his knowledge of her ad∣venture,
began to make love with great vehe∣mence.
At first, she pretended to take offence
at his presumption; but, perceiving from certain
<PB N="245" REF="250"/>
insinuations which he artfully dropp'd, that he
was better acquainted with her character than
she had imagined, her shyness gradually wore off,
and they soon came to a satisfactory explanation;
in the beginning of which, he frankly unravelled
the whole mystery of the apparition: a discovery
which had almost proved fatal to her, from the
violence of mirth it produced; and she as can∣didly
disclosed her own private history. She told
him, that her lover's honourable agent had for∣merly
lived in the house of her mother, who
being a poor widow, supported her family by
letting lodgings; that he had, by the opportu∣nities
of familiarity and friendship, employed
his arts upon her, and actually debauched
this girl, when she was no more than fifteen years
of age; that upon the remonstrances of her mo∣ther,
who detected their correspondence, by
perceiving she was with child, he had quitted
the house, with an absolute refusal to provide for
her; so that she was obliged to sue him for the
maintenance of the infant, and reduced to the
necessity of receiving gallants in private; though
she had always managed her occupation in such
a manner, as to preserve her character unsus∣pected
in the neighbourhood: and lastly, that
her first seducer had lately renewed his correspon∣dence,
by dint of presents and apologies, and
procured her as a virgin for his patron, who
had promised to settle some small provision upon
her for life.</P>
<P>Peregrine com<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orted her for her disappoint∣ment,
by reciting what he had overheard of the
conversation that passed in the garden, after she
made her elopement; from whence he inferred,
that her interest would suffer no prejudice from
<PB N="246" REF="251"/>
that interruption; because, in all probability,
her intended lover's flesh would soon get the better
of the spirit again, in spite of a thousand appa∣ritions;
in which case, he would again have re∣course
to her compliance; or, should his super∣stition
prevail, he would look upon himself as in
duty and conscience bound, to enable her, by a
suita ble settlement, to withstand such temptations
for the future.</P>
<P>She seemed to concur with his opinion, and
was perfectly satisfied with that expectation,
while our hero was more and more engaged by
her easy and agreeable deportment. Her conver∣sation
was that of a gay libertine, who had a
good share of sense and imagination, which, with
a natural vivacity, she employed in accommo∣dating
herself to the humour of her gallant: but
his ears were not disgusted with the nauseous ri∣baldry
and vulgar execrations which characterise
the discourse of those nymphs, whose temporary
endearments are solicited by the distinguishing
youth of this refined age. In a word▪ this acci∣dental
meeting was productive of very agreeable
consequences to both; and an intimacy of inter∣course
immediately commenced, the result of
which was, her promising to reserve her favours
for him alone, till farther notice, and to enter
into no measures with the visionary, but such as
he should know and approve.</P>
<P>Having passed the evening with this new ac∣quaintance,
and informed himself of the particu∣lars
necessary to be known, for the support of the
correspondence they had established, he favoured
her with some marks of his bounty, and repaired
to the lodgings of his friend Crabtree, who was
so much incensed at his breach of punctuality,
<PB N="247" REF="252"/>
that he ordered himself to be denied; and when
the young gentleman forced his entrance into his
chamber, <HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> would not open his mouth;
but assuming the most grim contraction of his
countenance, sat in sullen silence, till the circum∣stances
of the adventure, which his associate knew
how to relate to the greatest advantage, gradually
unbended his features to an involuntary smile,
which soon dilated into an unrestrained laugh,
assuring Peregrine of his forgiveness and appro∣bation:
for though (as I have already observed)
this Misanthrope had gained an absolute ascen∣dency
over the muscles of his face, and, when
under the eye of the world, could laugh inward∣ly,
without betraying the least symptom of mirth,
this self-denial was not exerted without pains;
and therefore he, in private, indemnified himself
for the trouble he was at, in preserving that in∣flexible
gravity in public.</P>
<P>Next day in the evening, our adventurer vi∣sited
his fair Phillis, and understood that she had
a message from the new convert, exhorting her
to repentance and reformation, and promising to
support her in her laudable endeavours, as soon as
she should be disposed to begin the great work.
At the same time, his trusty messenger had talked
of his patron's conversion in the most ludicrous
terms, accounted for the apparition, by affirm∣ing,
that it was no other than a dog, with a
paper-lanthorn hanging to his neck, equipped in
that manner by some prentices for their diversion;
that he had been thrown over the wall, with a
view to frighten the servants of the family; and
not liking his quarters, no sooner perceived the
garden-door opened, than he naturally ran to∣wards
it, in order to make his escape. He like∣wise
<PB N="248" REF="253"/>
frankly owned, that he had, with a view to
his own interest, encouraged his lord and master
in his superstitious fears, and even counselled him
to execute, in the course of his penitence, a plan
which he had formerly laid, of commencing au∣thor,
and espousing in print the cause of miracles,
against the children of perverseness and incredu∣lity:
and in conclusion, this faithful adviser had
made strong love on his own score, proposing to
maintain a correspondence with her, for which
she would be amply recompenced by the bounty
of his patron, whom he undertook to deceive
with a seigned account of her repentance.</P>
<P>The wench, having an aversion to the cha∣racter
of this parasite, whom she had too great
reason to know, instead of embracing his pro∣posal
with chearfulness and alacrity, told him
with an affected air of severity, that howsoever
his heart might be hardened against the warnings
of heaven, she had the internal comfort to find
her own breast touched with a due sense of her
unworthiness, and would, by the blessing of pro∣vidence,
imitate the salutary example of his good
friend, to whom she intended to write an account
of her inward workings, which she hoped were
no other than the motions of the spirit.</P>
<P>Mr. Mercury hearing this unexpected decla∣ration,
which was delivered with a face of pious
resolution, immediately availed himself of that
hypocrisy, which he possessed to such a consum∣mate
degree; and after having protested with
great earnestness, that what he had said, was ut∣tered
with a view to try whether or not she was
intirely mortified to all the l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts of the flesh, he
applauded her determination with the most lofty
encomiums, and admonished her to perseverance,
<PB N="249" REF="254"/>
in an enthusiastic harangue; during which, the
tears actually gushed from his eyes, and his looks
adopted a sort of wildness and extatic stare, as if
he had been really transported.</P>
<P>Though she saw through the disguise, she
seemed convinced of his sincerity; as a confir∣mation
of which, he gave her his purse, and
took his leave, assuring her that she should never
want, so long as she could retain grace enough
to persist in the happy work she had so righteously
begun. Peregrine approved of her behaviour,
and having instructed her with regard to her fu∣ture
conduct, returned to his auxiliary and intel∣ligencer,
with whom he concerted another stra∣tagem,
to be practised upon a certain she-gamester
of fashion, and a French adventurer, who, under
the title of count, supported with invincible ef∣frontery,
and a large stock of sinesse, had found
means to introduce himself among the quality,
from many of whom he had extracted large sums
of money at play. Among those whom he laid
under contribution, was this lady, who with all
the inclination of a rank sharper, had fallen a sa∣crifice
to his superior talents, and become his
debtor for five hundred pounds, which she could
not pay without the assistance of her husband,
whom she did not think proper to inform of the
loss. She had for some days evaded the demands
of her creditor, by divers specious pretences,
which, however, were soon exhausted; and he
grew so disagreeably importunate, as to threaten
an application to her lord, if she would not dis∣charge
the debt immediately.</P>
<P>The lady being a latitudinarian in her prin∣ciples,
and reduced to great perplexity by these
menaces, could think of no other expedient to
<PB N="250" REF="255"/>
extricate herself, than that of practising upon
the foreigner's heart, which she accordingly as∣sailed
with all the arts of coquetry, reinforced
by a very agreeable person, to which she had
been often indebted for sundry fortunate events.
Nevertheless, in all probability she would have
found the count impregnable, had not he, at
this crisis, luckily met with such a flow of suc∣cess,
as elevated his fancy, and opened his heart
to amorous impressions. In this state of exulta∣tion
did he first perceive, or at least acknowledge
the attractions of his debtor, to whom he, in a
billet, declared his passion, and frankly proposed
the alternative, which it was her sole aim to pro∣cure.</P>
<P>After the necessary scruples of decent reluc∣tance,
the affair was compromised, in the hear∣ing
of Cadwallader, who reported to his asso∣ciate,
that she had given the count an assignation
at the house of a discreet matron, who, under
the denomination of a milliner, kept commo∣dious
apartments for interviews of this kind.</P>
<P>Peregrine, who was not unknown to this
priestess of love, no sooner received this intelli∣gence,
than he went and bespoke one of her
chambers, contiguous to that which the foreigner
had chosen for his accommodation; and some
time before the hour of their appointment, took
possession of it, accompanied by Crabtree, whom
he had dressed in woman's apparel, because the
Misanthrope would not run the risque of being
observed <HI>in propria persona.</HI></P>
<P>The lovers, true to their contract, met pre∣cisely
at the hour; the lady having disguised
herself in an ordinary dishabille, with a capuchin,
the hood of which effectually concealed her
<PB N="251" REF="256"/>
countenance; and the door of their apartment
being shut, the count found himself on the brink
of enjoying his good fortune, when all of a sud∣den,
Peregrine, placing himself at the door, pro∣nounced
aloud, in the very voice and manner of
her lord, whom he personally knew, “Stand
firm upon your post, Mr. Constable, and take
care that none shall pass, while I break open the
door, and make sure of the delinquent; for now
I think her ladyship is fairly caught.”</P>
<P>This exclamation produced an instantaneous
effect in the chamber: the count, terrified at the
prospect of immediate death or prosecution, ran
directly to the window, and throwing up the
sash, would have made his exit into the street,
without ceremony; but my lady, who never
doubted that her husband was at the door, had
recourse to that presence of mind, which never
forsook her upon such occasions; and seizing her
gallant by the collar, exalted her voice, crying,
“Rape! Murder! Rape! Ah villain! do you
attempt my virtue? Are these the laces you in∣vited
me to come and see? Ah, you beastly
monster! Help, good people, help!”</P>
<P>The noise of these outcries, (in consequence
of which Pickle immediately retreated to his
den) alarmed the whole family. The landlady,
whose reputation was at stake, ran up stairs, ac∣companied
by two chairmen, who waited for
my lady below; and the door being burst open
by her directions, they found her ladyship in a
violent agitation, holding fast by the count, who
stood without his perriwig, shaking from head
to foot, in all the agony of horror and dismay▪
My lady, finding herself delivered from the at∣tempts
of this ravisher, sunk down upon the
<PB N="252" REF="257"/>
couch in a swoon; and while the matron of the
house administered to her nostrils, the chairmen
secured the poor gallant, whose faculties were
actually suppressed by the extasy of his fear.</P>
<P>The lady having a little recollected her spirits,
and looking around, without perceiving her hus∣band,
concluded that he was satisfied of her in∣nocence,
by the artifice of her behaviour, and
omitted to shew himself, that she might not be
shocked at his appearance. On this supposition,
she renewed her clamour against the count, whom
she reviled with the epithets of perfidious wretch,
and abominable ruffian; and expressed her doubts
about the honesty of the house, to which (she
said) he had decoyed her, on pretence of shewing
some laces of a new pattern, that the milliner had
received from abroad.</P>
<P>The landlady was no stranger to her person
or character, and therefore had never doubted
the truth of the count's information, when he
made her privy to the nature of this interview;
but her ladyship's present behaviour, (the true
cause of which she did not know) intirely al∣tered
her opinion; and she now believed, that
the count intended to have made her house the
scene of a rape in good earnest. This suggestion
divested her of all regard for her customer,
against whom she exclaimed with great viru∣lence,
as a person who had endeavoured to in∣tail
the curse of infamy upon her house; and
assured the plaintiff, that he had hired the apart∣ment
for a young lady, whom he pretended to
have privately espoused, without the consent of
her parents, from whose inquiries he had reasons
to conceal the place of her abode.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="258"/>
The rueful foreigner, baited with their joint
invectives, and more than half distracted with
the terrors of an English jury, never dream'd of
attempting to vindicate himself from the imputa∣tion
he had incurred; because he imagined the
whole affair was the result of a conspiracy against
his life and fortune; but falling upon his knees
before his accuser, in the most suppliant manner,
implored her pardon, which he offered to ac∣knowledge
by a present of a thousand pounds.
Had these terms been seasonably proposed, mat∣ters
would soon have been brought to an accom∣modation;
but she could not decently enter into
a treaty with him, in presence of such witnesses;
and besides, she believed herself still under the
inspection of her husband. She therefore rejected
his proffer with disdain, observing, that his guilt
was of such a nature, as to preclude all hopes of
forgiveness; and ordered the chairmen to take
charge of his person, until he should be taken in∣to
custody by an officer properly authorized.</P>
<P>Having given these directions, at which the
poor prisoner wrung his hands in horror and de∣spair,
she withdrew with the matron into another
room, in expectation of being visited by her hus∣band;
and after having waited some time with
manifest impatience, could not forbear asking if
there were any other lodgers in the house: when
the landlady replied in the negative, she began to
sift her with a variety of questions, in the course
of which she learn'd, that not a soul had entered
the house after her own arrival; and then con∣jectured,
that the voice she had mistaken for
her husband's, must have been part of a con∣versation
that passed in the next house, from
which she was separated by a thin party-wall.</P>
<P><PB N="254" REF="259"/>
This discovery mortisied her in one respect,
and plaserd her in another; she was chagrined at
the disagreeable interruption, because it laid her
under the necessity of exposing her character to
the inquiries of those whom her cries had brought
to her affitance; though she was at the same
time very well satisfied to find that her lord was
ignorant of the adventure, and that it was now
in her power to be revenged upon the count, for
the severity of his behaviour, when he acted in
the capacity of her creditor. She therefore res∣olved
to extrot a sum of money from him, by
way6 for composition; and, under pretence of
hushing up an affair, which might (otherwise)
give scandal an opportunity to be free with her
reputation, signified to her hostelsa, a desire of
seeing matters compromised.
The prudent miliner applauded her modera∣tion,
by which, she foresaw that her own cha∣racter
would escape censure; and being favoured
with her ladyship's confidence, went out imme∣diately,
in order to communicate her proposals to
the prisoner; but while these deliberations were
upon the carpet, he had employed his rhetyoric to
successfully upon his guard, that they were pre∣valed
upon to set him at liberty, and make their
own retreat, at the same time. So that her la∣dysship's
scheme proved abortive, and she was fain
to retire to her own house, meditating further
vengeance upon the fugitive, who did not think
proper to stand the brunt of her indignation; but
cecamped that night for his native country, in
which he happley secured his retreat, fully per∣suaded,
that his run had been planned by a pow∣erful
confederacy in England, of which my lady
who the chief instrument.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="260"/>
Mean while, our young gentleman and his
tutor enjoyed the consternation and perplexity
which they had produced, as an wholesome cha∣stisement
bestowed upon a profligate virago, lost
to all sense of oeconomy and decorum, and a just
punishment inflicted upon an infamous adven∣turer,
who not only pillaged, but also disgraced
the company by whom he was caressed. It was
in consequence of this adventure, that Peregrine
conceived a very ludicrous project, the execution
of which furnished entertainment and admiration
to all the fashionable people in town. The ap∣pearance
of Cadwallader in a female dress, was so
uncouth and preternatural, that the good mil∣liner,
who chanced to be favoured with a glimpse
of him, as he went up stairs with his supposed
gallant, was not only astonished, but affrighted
at the peculiarity of his countenance; and not∣withstanding
her well-tried discretion, which had
never permitted her curiosity to exceed the
bounds of complaisance, she could not forbear
calling her son Pickle into another room, after
her ladyship's retreat; and asking with manifest
marks of confusion and disquiet, if the person
whom he had brought into her house, was really
and <HI>bona side</HI> a woman and a christian; at the
same time, expressing her suspicion, from the
desposition of his companion's wrinkles, and the
bristles that appeared upon her chin, that she
was no better than a witch or a conjurer, whom
he had employed to embroil and expose her cu∣stomers
by the art of sorcery, for which she
prayed God would forgive him. “Certain I
am (said she) the count and my lady went into
the chamber with the disposition of two lambs,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the twinkling of an eye, (Lord have
<PB N="256" REF="261"/>
mercy upon us!) there was nothing to be heard
but discord and desperation! Ah! Mr. Pickle,
Mr. Pickle! it was for no charitable end, that
you was so anxious to occupy the next room. I
thought there was something unnatural in the
case, when I saw you lead up that old beldame
with the beard. You have ruined the reputation
of my house, Mr. Pickle. My good friends the
countess of Peppermarsh, lady Tickletoe, and
Mrs. Riggle, will never enter my doors again.
I shall be deprived of getting an honest liveli∣hood;
and all by the cruelty of one that I loved
as well as if I had been the mother that bore
him. O that ever I was born to see this unlucky
day!” These words she accompanied with sun∣dry
sobs, and a few <HI>extempore</HI> tears, the nature
of which he perfectly understood; and therefore
prescribed a cordial which in a moment set her
heart at ease.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="90" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XC.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">He persuades Cadwallader to assume the character
of a magician, in which he acquires a great
share of reputation, by his responses to three fe∣males
of distinction, who severally consult the
researches of his art.</HEAD>
<P>HER suspicion of his associate, while it af∣forded
him subject for mirth, struck his
imagination with an idea which he could not help
indulging; and when he communicated the con∣ceit
to Cadwallader, it in a moment acquired his
approbation. This notion he imparted in a pro∣posal,
to subject the town to their ridicule, by
giving responses in the character of a professed
<PB N="257" REF="262"/>
conjurer, to be personated by the old Misan∣thrope,
whose aspect was extremely well calcu∣lated
for the purpose. The plan was imme∣diately
adjusted in all its parts; an apartment
hired in an house accommodated with a public
stair; so that people might have free ingress and
egress, without being exposed to observation;
and this tenement being furnished with the appa∣ratus
of a magician, such as globes, telescopes,
a magic <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nthorn, a skeleton, a dried monkey,
together with the skins of an alligator, otter and
snake, the conjurer himself took possession of his
castle, after having distributed printed advertise∣ments,
containing the particulars of his under∣taking.</P>
<P>These bills soon operated according to the wish
of the projectors. As the price of the oracle
was fixed at half a guine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the public naturally
concluded, that the author was no common for∣tune-teller;
and the very next day, Peregrine
found some ladies of his quality-acquaintance, in∣fected
with the desire of making an experiment
upon the skill of this new conjurer, who pretended
to be just arrived from the Mogul's empire,
where he had learned the art from a Brachman
philosopher. Our young gentleman affected to
talk of the pretensions of this sage with ridicule
and contempt, and with seeming reluctance, un∣dertook
to attend them to his apartment, ob∣serving,
that it would be a very easy matter to
detect the fellow's ignorance, and no more than
common justice to chastise him for his presump∣tion.
Though he could easily perceive a great
fund of credulity in the company, they affected
to espouse his opinion, and under the notion
of a frolic, agreed, that one particular lady
<PB N="258" REF="263"/>
should endeavour to bassle his art, by appearing
before him in the dress of her woman, who
should, at the same time, personate her mistress,
and be treated as such by our adventurer, who
promised to squire them to the place. These
measures being concerted, and the appointment
fixed for the next audience-day, Peregrine fur∣nished
his friend with the necessary information;
and when the hour of assignation arrived, con∣ducted
his cha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ge to this oraculous seer.</P>
<P>They were admitted by our hero's valet d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
chambre, whose visage being naturally meagre
and swarthy, was adorned with artificial whiskers;
so that he became the Persian dress which he
were, and seemed a very proper master of the
ceremonies to an oriental Necromancer. Having
crossed his arms upon his breast, with an incli∣nation
of the head, he stalked in solemn silence
before them into the Penetralia of the temple,
where they sound the conjurer sitting at a table,
provided with pen, ink and paper, divers books
and mathematical instruments, and a long white
wand lying across the whole. He was habited
in a black grown and fur-cap, and his countenance,
over and above a double proportion of philosophic
gravity which he had assumed for the occasion,
was improved by a thick beard white as snow,
that reached to his middle, and upon each shoulder
sat a prodigious large black cat which had been
tutored for the purpose.</P>
<P>Such a figure, which would have startled Pe∣regrine
himself, had not be been concerned in
the mystery, could not fail to make an impression
upon these whom he accompanied. The ficti∣tious
chambermaid, in spite of all her natural
pertness and vivacity, changed colour when she
<PB N="259" REF="264"/>
entered the room, and the pretended lady, whose
intellects were not quite so enlightened, began to
tremble in every joint, and ejaculate petitions to
heaven for her safety. Their conductor ad∣vancing
to the table, presented his offering, and
pointing to the <HI>suivante,</HI> told him, that lady de∣sired
to know what would be her <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in point
of marriage. The philosopher, without lifting
up his eyes to view the person in whose behalf he
was consulted, turned his ear to one of the sable
familiars that purred upon his shoulder, and
taking up the pen, wrote upon a detached slip of
paper these words, which Peregrine, at the de∣sire
of the ladies, repeated aloud, “Her destiny
will, in a great measure, depend upon what hap∣pened
to her about nine o'clock in the morning,
on the third day of last December.”</P>
<P>This sentence was no sooner pronounced, than
the counterfeit lady uttered a fearful scream, and
ran out into the antichamber, exclaiming, “Christ
have mercy upon us! Sure he is the devil incar∣nate!”
Her mistress, who followed her with
great consternation, insisted upon knowing the
transaction to which the response alluded; and
Mrs. Abigail, after some recollection, gave her
to understand, that she had an admirer, who, on
the very hour and day mentioned by the cunning
man, had addressed himself to her in a serious pro∣posal
of marriage. This explanation, however,
was more ingenious than candid; for the admirer
was no other than the identical Mr. Pickle him∣self,
who was a meer dragon among the chamber∣maids,
and, in his previous information com∣municated
to his associate, had given an account
of this assignation, with which he had been fa∣voured
by the damsel in question.</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="265"/>
Our hero seeing his company very much af∣fected
with this circumstance of the wizzard's art,
which had almost frighted both mistress and maid
into hysteric fits, pretended to laugh them out of
their fears, by observing that there was nothing
extraordinary in this instance of his knowledge,
which might have been acquired by some of those
secret emissaries whom such impostors are obliged
to employ for intelligence, or imparted by the
lover himself, who had, perhaps, come to con∣sult
him about the success of his amour. En∣couraged
by this observation, or rather prompted
by an insatiable curiosity, which was proof
against all sort of apprehension, the disguised lady
returned to the magician's own apartment, and
assuming the air of a pert chambermaid, “Mr.
Conjurer (said she) now you have satisfied my
mistress, will you be so good as to tell me, if
ever I shall be married?” The sage, without the
least hesitation, favoured her with an answer, in
the following words: “You cannot be married
before you are a widow; and whether or not
that will ever be the case, is a question which my
art cannot resolve, because my foreknowledge ex∣ceeds
not the term of thirty years.”</P>
<P>This reply, which at once cut her off from
the pleasing prospect of seeing herself independent
in the enjoyment of youth and fortune, in a mo∣ment
clouded her aspect; all her good humour
was overcast, and she went away, without fur∣ther
inquiry, muttering, in the rancour of her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hagrin, that he was a Silly impertinent fellow,
and a meer quack in his profession. Notwith∣standing
the prejudice of this resentment, her
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onviction soon recurred; and when the report of
his answer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was made to those confederates by
<PB N="261" REF="266"/>
whom she had been deputed to make trial of his
skill, they were universally persuaded that his art
was altogether supernatural, tho' each affected
to treat it with contempt, resolving, in her own
breast, to have recourse to him in private.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the maid, tho' laid under
the most peremptory injunctions of secrecy, was
so full of the circumstance which related to her
own conduct, that she extolled his prescience, in
whispers to all her acquaintance, assuring them,
that he had told her all the particulars of her life;
so that his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame was almost instantaneosly con∣veyed,
thro' a thousand different channels, to all
parts of the town; and the very next time he as∣sumed
the chair, his doors were besieged by cu∣rious
people of all sects and denominations.</P>
<P>Being an old practitioner in this art, Cadwal∣laner
knew it would be impossible for him to sup∣port
his reputation in the promiscuous exercise of
fortune-telling, because every person that should
come to consult him would expect a sample of his
skill, relating to things past; and it could not be
supposed, that he was acquainted with the private
concerns of every individual who might apply to
him for that purpose: he therefore ordered his
minister, whom he distinguished by the name of
Hadgi Rourk, to signify to all those who de∣manded
entrance, that his price was half a guinea;
and that all such as were not disposed to gratify him
with that consideration would do well to leave the
passage free for the rest.</P>
<P>This declaration succeeded to his wish; for
this congregation consisted chiefly of footmen,
chambermaids, prentices, and the lower class of
tradesmen, who could not afford to purchase
prescience at such a price; so that, after fruitl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss
<PB N="262" REF="267"/>
offers of shillings and half crowns, they dropped
off one by one, and left the field open for cus∣tomers
of an higher rank.</P>
<P>The first person of this species who appeared
was dressed like the wife of a substantial trades∣man;
but this disguise could not screen her from
the penetration of the conjurer, who at first sight
knew her to be one of the ladies of whose coming
he had been apprized by Peregrine, on the sup∣position
that their curiosity was rather inflamed
than allayed by the intelligence they had receiv∣ed
from his first client. This lady approached
the philosopher with that intrepidity of counte∣nance
so conspicuous in matrons of her dignified
sphere, and in a soft voice, asked with a simper,
of what complexion her next child would be?
The necromancer, who was perfectly well ac∣quainted
with her private history, forthwith de∣livered
his response in the following question,
written in the usual form, “How long has Pom∣pey
the black been dismissed from your ladyship's
service?”</P>
<P>Endued as she was with a great share of that
fortitude which is distinguished by the appellation
of effrontery, her face exhibited some signs of
shame and confusion at the receit of this oracu∣lar
interrogation, by which she was convinced of
his extraordinary intelligence; and accosting him
in a very serious tone, “Doctor (said she) I per∣ceive
you are a person of great abilities in the art
you profess; and therefore, without pretending
to dissemble, I will own you have touched the
true string of my apprehensions. I am persuaded
I need not be more particular in my inquiries.
Here is a purse of money; take it, and deliver
me from a most alarming and uneasy suspence.”
So saying, she deposited her offering upon the
<PB N="263" REF="268"/>
table, and waited for his answer with a face of
fearful expectation, while he was employed in
writing this sentence for her perusal: “Tho' I
see into the womb of time, the prospect is not
perfectly distinct; the seeds of future events lie
mingled and confused: so that I am under the
necessity of assisting my divination in some cases,
by analogy and human intelligence; and cannot
possibly satisfy your present doubts, unless you
will condescend to make me privy to all those
occurrences which you think might have inter∣fered
with the cause of your apprehension.”</P>
<P>The lady having read the declaration, affected
a small emotion of shyness and repugnance, and
seating herself upon a settee, after having cau∣tiously
informed herself of the privacy of the
apartment, gave such a detail of the succession of
h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r lovers, as amazed while it entertained the ne∣cromancer,
as well as his friend Pickle, who
from a closet in which he had concealed himself,
overheard every syllable of her confession. Cad∣wallader
listened to her story with a look of in∣finite
importance and sagacity, and after a short
pause told her, that he would not pretend to give
a categorical answer, until he should have deli∣berated
maturely upon the various circumstances
of the aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r; but if she would take the trouble of
honouring him with another visit on his next
public day, he hoped he should be able to give
her full satisfaction. Conscious of the importance
of her d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bts, s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e could not help commending
his caution, and took her leave, with a promise
of returning at the appointed time; then the
conjurer being joined by his associate, they gave
a loose to their <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which having indulged,
they began to concert measures for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>
<PB N="264" REF="269"/>
disgraceful punishment on the shameless and insa∣tiate
termagant who had so impudently avowed
her own prostitution.</P>
<P>They were interrupted, however, in their
conference, by the arrival of a new guest, who
being announced by Hadgi, our hero retreated to
his lurking-place, and Cadwallader resumed his
mysterious appearance. This new client, tho'
she hid her face in a mask, could not conceal her∣self
from the knowledge of the conjurer, who by
her voice recognized her to be an unmarried
lady of his own acquaintance. She had, within
a small compass of time, made herself remark∣able
for two adventures, which had not at all
succeeded to her expectation: being very much
addicted to play, she had, at a certain route, in∣dulged
that passion to such excess, as not only got
the better of her justice, but also of her circum∣spection;
so that she was unfortunately detected
in her endeavours to appropriate to herself what
was not lawfully her due. This small slip was
attended with another indiscretion, which had
likewise an unlucky effect upon her reputation.
She had been favoured with the addresses of one
of those hopeful heirs who swarm and swagger
about town, under the denomination of Bucks;
and in the confidence of his honour consented to
be one of a partie that made an excursion as far as
Windsor, thinking herself secured from scandal by
the company of another young lady, who had
also condescended to trust her person to the pro∣tection
of her admirer. The two gallants, in
the course of this expedition, were said to use the
most perfidious means to intoxicate the passions
of their mistresses, by mixing drugs with their
<PB N="265" REF="270"/>
wine, which inflamed their constitutions to such
a degree, that they fell an easy sacrifice to the
appetites of their conductors, who, upon their
return to town, were so base and inhuman as to
boast among their companions of the exploit they
had atchieved. Thus the story was circulated,
with a thousand additional circumstances to the
prejudice of the sufferers, one of whom had
thought proper to withdraw into the country, un∣til
the scandal raised at her expence should sub∣side;
while the other, who was not so easily put
out of countenance, resolved to outface the re∣port,
as a treacherous aspersion, invented by her
lover as an excuse for his own inconstancy; and
actually appeared in public, as usual, till she
found herself neglected by the greatest part of her
acquaintance.</P>
<P>In consequence of this disgrace, which she
knew not wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther to impute to the card affair,
or to the last <HI>faux pas</HI> she had committed, she
now came to consult the conjurer, and signified
her errand, by asking whether the cause of her
present disquiet was of the town or country?
Cadwallader at once perceiving her allusion, an∣swered
her question in these terms. “This honest
world will forgive a young gamester for indiscretion
at play, but a favour granted to a blabbing cox∣comb
is an unpardonable offence.” This reponse
she received with equal astonishment and cha∣gri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
and, fully convinced of the necromancer's
om<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscience, implored his advice touching the
retrieval of her reputation: upon which he coun∣selled
her to wed with the first opportunity;
and she seemed so well pleased with his admoni∣tion,
that she gratified him with a double fee, and
dropping a low curt'sy, retired.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="271"/>
Our undertakers now thought it high time to

Peregrine and his friend renewed the deliberations,
which had been interrupted, and settled a plan of
operations for the next occasion: mean while it
was resolved, that Hadgi should not only exer∣cise
his own talents, but also employ inferior

<HEAD>CHAP. XCI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine and his friend Cadwallader proceed in
the exercise of the myst<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry of fortune-telling, in
the course of which they atchieve various adven∣tures.</HEAD>
<P>THESE preliminaries being adjusted, our
hero forthwith repaired to a card assembly,
which was frequented by some of the most not∣able
gossips in town, and having artfully turned
the conversation upon the subject of the fortune-teller,
whose talents he pretended to ridic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le, in∣censed
their itch of knowing secrets to such a de∣gree
of impatience, that their curiosity became
flagrant, and he took it for granted<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that all or
some of them would visit Albuma<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on his very
first visiting-day. While Peregrine was thus en∣gaged,
his associate made his appearance in ano∣ther
convocation of fashionable people, where
he soon had the pleasure of hearing the conjurer
brought upon the carpet by an elderly gentlewo∣man,
<PB N="267" REF="272"/>
remarkable for her inquisitive disposition,
who addressing herself to Cadwallader, asked, by
the help of the finger-alphabet, if he knew any
thing of the magician that made such a noise in
town? The misanthrope answered as usual, in
a surly tone, “By your question you must either
take me for a pimp or an ideot. What, in the
name of nonsense, should I know of such a ras∣cal,
unless I were to court his acquaintance with
a view to feast my own spleen, in seeing him fool
the whole nation out of their money? Tho', I
suppose, his chief profits arise from his practice,
in quality of pander. All fortune-tellers are
bawds, and for that reason are so much followed
by people of fashion. This fellow (I warrant)
has got sundry convenient apartments for the be∣nefit
of procreation; for it is not to be supposed
that those who visit him on the pretence of con∣sulting
his supernatural art, can be such fools,
such drivelers, as to believe that he can actually
prognosticate future events.”</P>
<P>The company, according to his expectation,
imputed his remarks to the rancour of his dispo∣sition,
which could not bear to think that any
person upon earth was wiser than himself; and
his ears were regaled with a thousand instances of
the conjurer's wonderful prescience, for which
he was altogether indebted to fiction. Some of
these specimens being communicated to him, by
way of appeal to his opinion, “They are (said
he) meer phantoms of ignorance and credulity,
swelled up in the repetition, like those unsub∣stantial
bubbles which the boys blow up in soap∣suds
with a tobacco pipe. And this will ever be
the case in the propagation of all extraordinary
intelligence: the imagination naturally magnifies
<PB N="270" REF="273"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dant seeing him very much irritated, positively
denied that he had mentioned a brace; one in∣deed
(said he) I own I took notice of, upon the
authority of your own physician, who gave me
an account of it this morning.” “By the Lord!
(cried the sufferer in a rage which he could no
longer contain) that rascal has been suborned by
my rival, to slander my character in this man∣ner;
but I'll be revenged, if there be either law
or equity in England.” He had scarce pro∣nounced
these words, when the doctor happened
to enter the room; when his exasperated patient
li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting up his cane, “Sirrah (said he) if I live,
I'll make that black crow the blackest circum∣stance
of thy whole life and conversation.” The
physician, confounded at this address, assured
him that he was utterly ignorant of his meaning,
and when the other gentleman explained it, ab∣solutely
denied the charge, affirming he had said
no more than that he had vomited a quantity of
something as black as a crow. The landlord of
the house acknowledged that he might have been
mistaken; and thus the whole mystery was ex∣plained.”</P>
<P>The company seemed to relish the story of the
three black crows, which they considered as an
impromptu of Cadwallader's own invention; but,
granting it to be true, they unanimously declared
that it could have no weight in invalidating the
testimony of divers persons of honour, who had
been witnesses of the magician's supernatural
skill. On the next day of consultation, the ne∣cromancer
being in the chair, and his friend be∣hind
the curtain, the outward door was scarce
opened, when a female visitant flounced in, and
discovered to the magician the features of one of
<PB N="271" REF="274"/>
those inquisitive ladies, whose curiosity, he knew,
his confederate had aroused, in the manner above
described. She addressed herself to him with a
familiar air, observing, that she had heard much
of his great knowledge, and was come to be a
witness of his art, which she desired him to dis∣play,
in declaring what he knew to be her ruling
passion.</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who was no stranger to her dis∣position,
assumed the pen without hesitation, and
f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rnished her with an answer, importing, that
the love of money predominated, and scandal
possessed the next place in her heart. Far from
being offended at his freedom, she commended
his frankness with a smile; and, satisfied of his
uncomm<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n talents, expressed a desire of being
better acquainted with his person: nay, she
began to catechise him, upon the private history
of dive<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s great families, in which he happened
to be well versed; and he, in a mysterious man∣ner,
dropt such artful hints of his knowledge,
that she was amazed at his capacity, and actually
asked if his art was communicable. The con∣jurer
replied in the affirmative; but, at the same
time, gave her to understand, that it was attain∣able
by those only who were pure and undefiled
in point of chastity and honour; or such as, by
a long course of penitence, had weaned them∣selves
from all attachments to the flesh. She not
only disapproved, but seemed to doubt the truth
of this assertion; telling him, with a look of
disdain, that his art was not worth having, if one
could not use it for the benefit of one's pleasure:
she had even penetration enough to take notice
of an inconsistency in what he had advanced;
and asked, why he himself exercised his know∣ledge
<PB N="272" REF="275"/>
for hire, if he was so much detached from
all worldly concerns. “Come, come, doctor,
added she, you are in the right to be cautious
against impertinent curiosity; but, perhaps, I
may make it worth your while to be communi∣cative.”</P>
<P>These overtures were interrupted by a rap at
the door, signifying the approach of another
client; upon which the lady inquired for his
private passage, thro' which she might retire,
without the risque of being seen: and when she
understood he was deficient in that convenience,
she withdrew into an empty room, adjoining to
the audience-chamber, in order to conceal herself
from the observation of the new-comer. This
was no other than the inamorata, who came by
appointment to receive the solution of her doubts:
and the Misanthrope, glad of an opportunity to
expose her to the censure of such an indefatigable
minister of same as the person, who (he knew)
would listen from the next apartment; laid her
under the necessity of refreshing his remembrance
with a recapitulation of her former confession,
which was almost finished, when she was alarmed
by a noise at the door, occasioned by two gentle∣men
who attempted to enter by force.</P>
<P>Terrified at this uproar, which disconcerted
the magician himself, she ran for shelter into the
place which was pre-occupied by the other lady,
who, hearing this disturbance, had closed the
window-shutters, that she might have the better
chance of remaining unknown. Here they en∣sconced
themselves, in the utmost consternation,
while the necromancer, after some recollection,
ordered Hadgi to open the door, and admit the
rioters, who (he hoped) would be over-awed by
<PB N="273" REF="276"/>
the authority of his appearance. The janitor
had no sooner obeyed his instructions, than in
rushed a young libertine, who had been for some
time upon the town, together with his tutor,
who was a worn-out debauchee, well known to
the magician. They were both in that degree of
intoxication necessary to prepare such dispositions
for what they commonly call frolicks, and the
sober part of mankind feel to be extravagant out∣rages
against the laws of their country, and the
peace of their fellow-subjects. Having staggered
up to the table, the senior, who undertook to be
spokesman, saluted Cadwallader with “How
do'st do, old Capricorn? Thou seem'st to be a
most venerable pimp, and, I doubt not, hast
abundance of discretion. Here is this young
whoremaster (a true chip of the old venereal
block his father) and myself, come for a comfort∣able
cast of thy function. I don't mean that
stale pretence of conjuring: damn futurity; let
us live for the present, old Haly. Conjure me
up a couple of hale wenches, and, I warrant,
we shall get into the magic circle in a twinkling.
What sa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Galileo? What says the reverend
Brahe? Here is a purse, you pimp: hark, how it
chinks! This is sweeter than the musick of the
spheres.”</P>
<P>Our necromancer, perplexed at this rencoun∣ter,
made no reply; but taking up his wand,
waved it around his head in a very mysterious
motion, with a view of intimidating these for∣ward
visitants, who, far from being awed by
this sort of evolution, became more and more ob∣streperous,
and even threatened to pull h<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m by
the beard, if he would not immediately comply
with their desire. Had he called his associate, or
<PB N="274" REF="277"/>
even Hadgi, to his aid, he knew he could have
soon calmed their turbulence; but, being unwil∣ling
to run the risque of a discovery, or even of
a riot, he bethought himself of chastising their
insolence in another manner that would be less
hazardous, and rather more effectual. In con∣sequence
of this suggestion, he pointed his wand
towards the door of the apartment in which the
ladies had taken sanctuary; and the two rakes,
understanding the hint, rushed in without hesi∣tation.</P>
<P>The females finding their place of retreat
taken by assault, ran about the room in great
consternation, and were immediately taken pri∣soners
by the assailants, who pulling them to∣wards
the windows, opened the shutters at the
same instant of time, when (strange to tell!) one
of the heroes discovered, in the prize he had made,
the very wife of his bosom; and his companion
perceived that he had stumbled in the dark upon
his own mother. Their mutual astonishment
was unspeakable at this eclaircissement, which
produced an universal silence for the space of se∣veral
minutes; and during this pause the ladies
having recollected themselves, an expostulation
was begun by the elder of the two, who roundly
took her son to task for his disorderly life, which
laid her under the disagreeable necessity of watch∣ing
his motions, and detecting him in such an
infamous place.</P>
<P>While the careful mother thus exercised her
talent for reprehension, the hopeful young gen∣tleman,
with an hand in each fob, stood whistling
an opera-tune, without seeming to pay the most
profound regard to his parent's reproof: and the
other lady, in imitation of such a consummate
<PB N="275" REF="278"/>
pattern, began to open upon her husband, whom
she bitterly reproached with his looseness and in∣temperance,
demanding to know what he had to
alledge in alleviation of his present misconduct.
The surprize occasioned by such an unexpected
meeting had already in a great measure destroyed
the effects of the wine he had so plentifully drank,
and the first use he made of his recovered sobriety,
was to revolve within himself the motives that
could possibly induce his wife to give him the
rendezvous in this manner. As he had good
reason to believe she was utterly void of jealousy,
he naturally placed this rencontre to the account
of another passion; and his chagrin was not at
all impaired by the effrontery with which she now
presumed to reprimand him. He listened to her,
therefore, with a grave, or rather grim aspect;
and to the question with which she concluded her
rebuke, answered with great composure, “All
that I have to alledge, madam, is that the bawd
has committed a mistake, in consequence of
which we are both disappointed: and so, ladies,
your humble servant.” So saying, he retired
with manifest confusion in his looks; and as he
passed through the audience-chamber, eying the
conjurer askance, pronounced the epithet of <HI>pre∣cious
rascal,</HI> with great emphasis. Mean while,
the junior, like a dutiful child, handed his
mamma to her chair; and the other client, after
having reviled the necromancer, because he could
not foresee this event, went away in a state of
mortification.</P>
<P>The coast being clear, Peregrine came forth
from his den, and congratulated his friend upon
the peaceable issue of the adventure which he had
overheard: but, that he might not be exposed
<PB N="276" REF="279"/>
to such inconvenience for the future, they re∣solved,
that a grate should be fixed in the middle
of the outward door, through which the conjurer
himself should reconnoitre all the visitants, before
their admission; so that, to those whose appear∣ance
he should not like, Hadgi should, without
opening, give notice, that his master was en∣gaged.
By this expedient too, they provided
against those difficulties which Cadwallader must
have encountered, in giving satisfaction to stran∣gers,
whom he did not know; for the original
intention of the founders was to confine the prac∣tice
of their art to people of fashion only, most
of whom were personally known to the counter∣feit
magician and his coadjutor.</P>
<P>Indeed, these associates, Cadwallader in par∣ticular,
notwithstanding his boasted in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight into
the characters of life, never imagined that his
pretended skill would be consulted by any but the
weaker-minded of the female sex, incited by that
spirit of curiosity which he knew was implanted
in their nature: but, in the course of his practice,
he found himself cultivated in his preternatural
capacity, by people of all sexes, complexions,
and degrees of reputation, and had occasion to
observe, that when the passions are concerned,
howsoever cool, cautious and deliberate, the dis∣position
may otherwise be, there is nothing so
idle, frivolous, or absurd, to which they will not
apply for encouragement and gratification. The
last occurrence, according to the hopes and ex∣pectation
of the confederates, was whispered
about by the ladies concerned, in such a manner,
that the whole affair was, in a few days, the uni∣versal
topic of discourse, in which it was retailed
with numberless embelishments, invented by the
<PB N="277" REF="280"/>
parties themselves, who had long indulged a pique
at each other, and took this opportunity of en∣joying
their revenge.</P>
<P>These incidents, while they regaled the spleen,
at the same time augmented the renown of the
conjurer, who was described on both sides as a
very extraordinary person in his way; and the
alteration in his door was no sooner performed,
than he had occasion to avail himself of it, against
the intrusion of a great many, with whom he
would have found it very difficult to support the
same he had acquired.</P>
<P>Among those who appeared at his grate, he
perceived a certain clergyman, whom he had long
known an humble attendant on the great, and
with some the reputed minister of their pleasures▪
This Levite had disguised himself in a great▪ coat
boots, and dress quite foreign to the habit worn
by those of his function; and being admitted, at∣tempted
to impose himself as a country squire
upon the conjurer, who calling him by his name,
desired him to sit down. This reception corres∣ponding
with the report he had heard, touching
our magician's art, the doctor said he would lay
aside all dissimulation; and after having professed
an implicit belief, that his supernatural know∣ledge
did not proceed from any communication
with evil spirits, but was the immediate gift of
heaven, he declared the intention of his coming
was to inquire into the health of a good friend
and brother of his, who possessed a certain living
in the country, which he named; and, as he
was old and infirm, to know what space of time
was allotted to him in this frail state of mortality,
that he might have the melancholy satisfaction of
<PB N="278" REF="281"/>
attending him in his last moments, and assisting
him in his preparations for eternity.</P>
<P>The conjurer, who at once perceived the pur∣port
of this question, after a solemn pause, dur∣ing
which he seemed absorpt in contemplation,
delivered this response to his consulter, “Tho' I
foresee some occurrences, I do not pretend to be
omniscient. I know not to what age that cler∣gyman's
life will extend, but so far I can pene∣trate
into the womb of time, as to disce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that
the incumbent will survive his intended succes∣sor.”
This dreadful sentence in a moment ba∣nished
the blood from the face of the appalled
consulter, who hearing his own doom pronounc∣ed,
began to tremble in every joint; he listed up
his eyes in the agony of fear, and saying, “The
will of God be done,” withdrew in silent despon∣dence,
his teeth chattering with terror and disinay.</P>
<P>This client was succeeded by an old man
about the age of seventy-five, who b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ng re∣solved
to purchase a lease, desired to be deter∣mined
in the term of years by the necromancer's
advice, observing, that as he had no children of
his own body, and had no regard for his heirs at
law, the purchase would be made with a view to
his own convenience only; and therefore, con∣sidering
his age, he himself hesitated in the pe∣riod
of the lease, between thirty and threescore
years.</P>
<P>The conjurer, upon due deliberation, ad∣vised
him to double the last specified term, be∣cause
he distinguished in his features something
portending extreme old age and second childhood,
and he ought to provide for that state of incapa∣city,
which otherwise would be attended with
infinite misery and affliction. The superannuat∣ed
<PB N="297" REF="282"/>
wretch, thunderstruck with this prediction,
held up his hands, and, in the first transports of
his apprehension, exclaimed, “Lord have mercy
upon me! I have not wherewithal to purchase
such a long lease, and I have long outlived all
my friends; what then must become of me, sin∣ner
that I am, one hundred and twenty years
hence!” Cadwallader (who enjoyed his terror)
under pretence of alleviating his concern, told
him, that what he had prognosticated did not de∣prive
him of the means which he and every per∣son
had in their power, to curtail a life of mis∣fortune;
and the old gentleman went away,
seemingly comforted with the assurance, that it
would always be in his power to employ an hal∣ter
for his own deliverance.</P>
<P>Soon after the retreat of this elder, the magi∣cian
was visited by one of those worthies known
among the Romans by the appellation of <HI>Here∣dipetes,</HI>
who had amassed a large fortune by a
close attention to the immediate wants and
weakness of raw unexperienced heirs. This ho∣nourable
usurer had sold an annuity upon the life
of a young spendthrist, being thereto induced by
the affirmation of his physician, who had assured
him his patient's constitution was so rotten, that
he could not live one year to an end: he had, ne∣vertheless,
made shi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to weather eighteen months,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now seemed more vigorous and healthy than
he had ever been known; for he was supposed
to have nourished an hereditary pox from his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Alarmed at this alteration, the sellor
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to consult Cadwallader not only about the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the ann<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt, but also concerning the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of his health at the time of his purchasing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 words" DISP="〈◊◊〉"/>, purposing to sue the physician for
<PB N="280" REF="283"/>
false intelligence, should the conjurer declare
that the young man was sound, when the doc∣tor
pronounced him diseased. But this was a
piece of satisfaction he did not obtain from the
Misanthrope, who, in order to punish his sordid
disposition, gave him to understand, that the
physician had told him the truth, and nothing
but the truth; and that the young gentleman was
in a fair way of attaining a comfortable old age.”</P>
<P>“That is to say (cried the client, in the impatience
of his mortification at this answer) bating acci∣dents;
for, thank God, the annuitant does not
lead the most regular l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe: besides, I am credibly
informed he is choleric and rash; so that he may
be concerned in a duel: then there are such
things as riots in the street, in which a rake's
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may be casually cracked; he may be over∣turned
in a coach, overset in the river, thrown
from a vicious horse, overtaken with a cold, en∣dangered
by a surseit; but what I place my chief
confidence in, is an hearty pox, a distemper
which hath been fatal to his whole family. Not
but that the issue of all these things is uncertain;
and expedients might be found, which would
more effectually answer the purpose. I know
they have arts in India, by which a man can se∣cure
his own interest, in the salutation of a
friendly shake by the hand; and I don't doubt
that you who have lived in that country, are
master of the secret. To be sure, if you was in∣cl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ned
to communicate such a nostrum, there are
abundance of people who would purchase it, at
a very high price.”</P>
<P>Cadwallader understood this insinuation, and
was tempted to amuse him in such a manner as
would tend to his disgrace and confusion; but, con∣sidering
<PB N="281" REF="284"/>
that the case was of too criminal a nature
to be tampered with, he withstood his desire of
punishing this rapacious cormorant any other
way than by telling him, he would not impart
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t secret for his whole fortune ten times doubled;
so that the usurer retired, very much dissatisfied
with the issue of his consultation.</P>
<P>The next person who presented himself at this
altar of intelligence, was an author, who recom∣mended
himself to a gratis advice, by observing
that a prophet and poet were known by the same
appellation among the antients; and that, at this
day, both the one and the other spoke by inspi∣ration.
The conjurer refused to own this affini∣ty,
which, he said, formerly subsisted, because
both species of the <HI>Vates</HI> were the children of
fiction; but as he himself did not fall under that
predicament, he begged leave to disown all con∣nexion
with the family of the poets; and the
poor author would have been dismissed without
his errand, tho' he offered to leave an ode as se∣curity
for the magician's see, to be paid from the
profits of his first third night, had not Cadwalla∣der's
curiosity prompted him to know the subject
of this gentleman's inquiry. He therefore told
him, that in consideration of his genius, he
would for once satisfy him, without a fee; and
desired him to spec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy the doubts in which he
wished to be resolved.</P>
<P>The son of Parnassus, glad of this condescen∣sion,
for which he thanked the necromancer,
gave him to understand, that he had some time
before presented a play in manuscript to a cer∣tain
great man, at the head of taste, who had not
only read and approved the performance, but
also undertaken to introduce and support it on
<PB N="282" REF="285"/>
the stage; that he (the author) was assured by
this patron, that the play was already (in conse∣quence
of his recommendation) accepted by one
of the managers, who had faithfully promised to
bring it to light; but that, when he waited on
this same manager, to know when he intended
to put his production into rehearsal, the man de∣clared
he had never seen or heard of the piece:
“Now, Mr. Conjurer (said he) I want to
know whether or not my play has been present∣ed,
and if I have any sort of chance of seeing it
acted this winter?</P>
<P>Cadwallader, who had, in his younger days,
sported among the theatrical muses, began to lose
his temp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r at this question, which recalled the
remembr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce of his own disappointments; and
dispatched the author with an abrupt answer, im∣porting,
that the affairs of the stage were alto∣gether
without the sphere of his d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vination, being
intirely regulated by the daemons of dissimulation,
ignorance, and caprice.</P>
<P>It would be an endless task to recount every
individual response which our magician delivered,
in the course of his conjuration. He was con∣sulted
in all cases of law, physic, and trade, over
and above the ordinary subjects of marriage and
fornication; his advice and assistance were solli∣cited
by sharpers who desired to possess an insal∣lible
method of cheating, unperceived; by for∣tune-hunters
who wanted to make prize of wi∣dows
and heiresses; by debauchees who were
disposed to lye with other men's wives; by cox∣combs
who longed for the death of their fathers;
by wenches with child, who wished themselves
rid of their burthens; by merchants who had in∣sured
above value, and thirsted after the news of
<PB N="283" REF="286"/>
a wreck; by under-writers who prayed for the
gift of prescience, that they might venture mo∣ney
upon such ships only, as should perform the
voyage in safety; by Jews who wanted to fore∣see
the fluctuations of stock; by usurers who ad∣vance
money upon undecided causes; by clients
who were dubious of the honesty of their coun∣cil:
in short, all matters of uncertain issue were
appealed to this tribunal; and, in point of calcu∣lation,
<HI>De Moivre</HI> was utterly neglected.</P>

undisguised, passed as it were in re∣view
before the confederates, who, by divers in∣genious
contrivances, punished the most flagrant
offenders with as much severity as the nature of
their plan would allow. At length, they pro∣jected
a scheme for chastising a number of their
own acquaintance, who had all along professed
the utmost contempt for the talents of this con∣jurer,
which they endeavoured to ridicule in all
companies, where his surprising art was the sub∣ject
of discourse; not that they had sense and dis∣cernment
enough to perceive the absurdity of his
pretensions, but affected a singularity of opinion,
with a view of insulting the inferior understandings
of those who were deceived by such an idle im∣postor.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="287"/>
Peregrine indeed, for obvious reasons, had al∣ways
espoused their judgment in this case, and
joined them in reviling the public character of
his friend; but he knew how far the capacities of
those virtuosi extended, and had frequently caught
them in the fact of recounting their exploits
against the conjurer, which were the productions
of their own invention only. On these conside∣rations,
his wrath was kindled against them, and
he accordingly concerted measures with his coad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tor,
for over<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>helming them with confusion and
dismay.</P>
<P>In the first place, a report was spread by his
emissaries, that the magician had undertaken to
entertain the view with the appearance of any
person whom his customers should desire to see,
whether dead, or at the distance of a thousand
leagues. This extraordinary proposal chancing
to be the subject of conversation, in a place where
most of those infidels were assembled, they talked
of it in the usual stil<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and some of them swore,
the fellow ought to be pillory'd for his pre∣sumption.</P>
<P>Our hero seizing this favourable opportunity,
acquiesced in their remarks, and observed with
great vehemence, that it would be a meritorious
action to put the rascal to the proof, and then
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oss him in a blanket for non-performance. They
were wonderfully pleased with this suggestion,
and forthwith determined to try the experiment;
though, as they understood the apparition would
be produced to one only at a time, they could
not immediately agree in the choice of the person
who should stand the first brunt of the magician's
skill. While each of them severally excused
himself from this preference on various pretences,
<PB N="285" REF="288"/>
Peregrine readily undertook the post, expressing
great confidence of the conjurer's incapacity to
give him the least cause of apprehension.</P>
<P>This point being settled, they detached one of
their number to Crabtree, in order to bespeak
and adjust the hours and terms of the operation,
which he insisted upon performing at his own
apartment, where every thing was prepared for
the occasion. At the appointed time, they went
thither in a body, to the number of seven, in full
expectation of detecting the impostor; and were
received with such gloomy formality, as seemed
to have an effect upon the countenances of some
among them; though they were encouraged by
the vivacity of Pickle, who affected a double
share of petulance, for the more effectual ac∣complishment
of his purpose.</P>
<P>Cadwallader made no reply to the interroga∣tions
they uttered, in the levity of their insolence,
at their first entrance, but ordered Hadgi to con∣duct
them through the next room, that they
might see there was no previous apparatus to af∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>right
their deputy with objects foreign to his un∣dertaking.
They found nothing but a couple of
wax-tapers burning on a table that stood with a
chair by it, in the middle of the apartment, and
returned to the audience-chamber, leaving Pere∣grine
by himself, to encounter the phantom of
that person, whom they should (without his
knowledge) desire the magician to conjure up to
his view.</P>
<P>All the doors being shut, and the company
seated, a profound silence ensued, together with
a face of dreadful expectation, encouraged by
the blue flame of the candles, which were tipt
with sulphur for that purpose, and heightened by
<PB N="286" REF="289"/>
the dismal sound of a large bell, which Hadgi
tolled in the anti-chamber. Cadwallader having
thus practised upon their ignorance and fear, de∣sired
them to name the person to be produced;
and after some whispers among themselves, one
of them took the pen, and writing the name of
commodore Trunnion upon a slip of paper, put
it into the hands of the magician, who rose from
his seat, and opening the door of his closet, dis∣played
to their view a scull, with thigh-bones
crossed upon a table covered with black cloth.</P>
<P>This melancholy spectacle made a remarkable
impression upon the imaginations of the com∣pany,
already prepossessed by the previous cere∣mony;
and they began to survey one another
with looks of consternation, while Cadwallader
shutting himself in the closet, that was contiguous
to the chamber in which his friend Peregrin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was
stationed, thrust the label with his uncle's name
through a small chink in the partition, according
to agreement, muttering all the time a sort of
gibberish, that increased the pannic of his au∣dience;
then returning to his chair, the knell
was knolled again, and Pickle called aloud,
“Damn your mummery, why don't you dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>?”</P>
<P>This was a signal to Crabtree, who thus cer∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>fied
of his having received the paper, stood up
and waved his wand in the figure of an S. The
motion being thrice performed, their ears were all
of a sudden invaded by a terrible noise in the next
room, accompanied with the voice of Peregrine,
who exclaimed in a tone of horror and amaze∣ment,
“Guard me, heaven! my uncle Trun∣nion!”
This ejaculation ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such an effect up∣on
the hearers, that two of them swooned with
<PB N="287" REF="290"/>
fear, a third fell upon his knees, and prayed
aloud, while the other three, in a transport of
dismay and distraction, burst open the door, and
rushed into the haunted chamber, where they
found the table and chair overturned, and Pere∣guine
extended (in all appearance) without sense
or motion, upon the floor.</P>
<P>They immediately began to chase his temples▪
and the first symptom of his recovery, which
they perceived, was an hollow groan; after which,
he pronounced these words: “Merciful powers!
if I live, I saw the commodore with his black
patch, in the very cloaths he wore at my sister's
wedding.” This declaration compleated their
astonishment and terror; they observed a wild∣ness
in his looks, which he seemed to bend on
something concealed from their view; and were
infected by his appearance to such a pitch of su∣perstition,
that it would have been an easy matter
to persuade them, that the chair and table were
apparitions of their forefathers. However, they
conducted Peregrine into the council chamber,
where the conjurer and Hadgi were employed in
ministring to those who had fainted: and the pa∣tients
having retrieved the use of their faculties,
Cadwallader assuming a double portion of severity
in his aspect asked if they were not ashamed of
their former incredulity; declaring, that he was
ready to give them more convincing proofs of his
art upon the spot, and would immediately recal
th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rations of their progenitors from the
dead, if they were disposed to relish such com∣pany.
Then turning to one of them, whose
great grandfather had been hanged, “Are you
(<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he) am<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ous of seeing the first remarkable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of your family? Say the word; and
he shall appear.”</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="291"/>
This youth, who had been the most insolent
and obstreperous of the whole society, and was
now depressed with the same proportion of fear,
alarmed at the proposal, assured the magician, he
had no curiosity of that sort remaining; and that,
what he had already seen, would (he hoped)
have a good effect upon his future life and con∣versation.
Every one of these heroes made an
acknowledgment and profession of the same kind,
some of which were attended with tears; and
Hadgi having provided chairs for the whole com∣pany,
they depa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted exceedingly crest<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fallen; and
two of the number actually sickened with the
agitation they had undergone, while our hero and
his associate made themselves merry with the suc∣cess
of their enterprise.</P>
<P>But this scheme of fortune telling did not en∣gress
his whole attention; he still continued to
maintain his appearance in the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eau monde; and
as his expence far exceeded his income, strove to
contract intimacies with people of interest and
power: he shewed himself regularly at court,
paid his respects to them in all places of public di∣version,
and frequently entered into their parties,
either of pleasure or cards. In the course of this
cultivation, he happened one evening, at a cer∣tain
chocolate-house, to overlook a match at
piquet, in which he perceived a couple of sharpers
making prey of a young nobleman, who had nei∣ther
temper nor skill sufficient to cope with such
antagoni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s.</P>
<P>Our hero being a professed enemy to all
knights of industry, could not bear to see them
cheat in pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lick with such insolent audacity; and
therefore, under pretence of communicating some
business of importance, he begg'd the favour of
<PB N="289" REF="292"/>
speaking to the young gentleman in another cor∣ner
of the room, and in a friendly manner cau∣tioned
him against the arts of his opponents.
This hot-headed representative, far from thinking
or owning himself obliged to Pickle for his good
counsel, looked upon the advice as an insult upon
his understanding; and replied with an air of fe∣rocious
displeasure, that he knew how to take
care of his own concerns, and would not suffer
either him or them to bubble him out of one
shilling.</P>
<P>Peregrine, offended at the association, as well
as at the ingratitude and solly of this conceited
coxcomb, expressed his resentment, by telling
him, that he expected at least an acknowledge∣ment
for his candid intention; but he found his
intellects too much warped by his vanity, to per∣ceive
his own want of capacity and experience,
Instantned by this reproof, the young nobleman
challenged him to play for five hundred pounds,
with many opprobrious, or at least contemptuous
terms of defiance, which provoked our hero to
accept the proposel; and after the other had dis∣engaged
himself from the old rooks, who were
extremely mortified at the interruption, the two
young champions sat down, and fortune acting
with uncommon impartiality, Pickle, by the supe∣ri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rity
of his talents, in two hours won to the
amount of as many thousand pounds, for which
he was obliged to take his antagonist's no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, the
sharpers having previously secured his ready money.</P>
<P>Frantic with his loss, the rash young man
would have continued the game, and doubled
flakes every time; so that Peregrine might have
increased his acquisition to ten times the sum he
had gained; but he thought he had already suffi∣ciently
<PB N="290" REF="293"/>
chastifed the presumption of the chal∣lenger,
and was unwilling to impower fortune to
ravish from him the frui<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his success: he
therefore declined my lord's proposal, unless he
would play for ready money; and his lordship
having in vain tried his credit among the com∣pany,
our adventurer withdrew, leaving him in
an extasy of rage and disappointment.</P>
<P>As the insolence of his behaviour had increased
with his ill luck, and he had given vent to divers
expressions, which Peregrine took amiss, our
young gentleman resolved to augment his punish∣ment,
by teazing him with demands which could
not, he knew, be immediately satisfied; and
next day, sent Pipes to his father's house with the
note, which was drawn payable upon demand.
The debtor, who had gone to bed half distracted
with his misfortune, finding himself waked with
such a disagreeable dun, l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st all patience, cursed
Pickle, threatened his messenger, blasphemed
with horrible execrations, and made such a noise,
as reached the ears of his father, who ordering
his son to be called into his presence, examined
him about the cause of that uproar, which had
disturbed the whole family. The young gentle∣man,
after having essayed to amuse him with
sundry equivocations, which served only to in∣crease
his su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>picion, and desire of knowing the
truth, acknowledged that he had lost some mo∣ney
overnight at cards, to a gam<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster, who had
been so impertinent as to send a message, de∣manding
it that morning, though he had told the
fellow, it would not su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t him to pay it imme∣diately.
The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ather, who was a man of honour,
repro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ched him with gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t severity <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or his prosli∣gate
behaviour in general, and this seandalous
<PB N="291" REF="294"/>
debt in particular, which he believed to be some
trifle, and giving him a bank note for five hun∣dred
pounds, commanded him to go and dis∣charge
it, without loss of time. This well-prin∣cipled
heir took the money, but instead of waiting
upon his creditor, he forthwith repaired to the
gaming-house, in hopes of retrieving his loss;
and before he rose from the table, saw his note
mortgaged for seven eighths of its value.</P>
<P>Mean while, Pickle, incensed at the treatment
which his servant had received, and informed of
his lordship's second loss, which aggravated his
resentment, determined to preserve no medium;
and taking out a writ that same day, put it im∣mediately
in execution upon the body of his
debtor, just as he stepp'd into his chair, at the
door of White's Chocolate-house. The pri∣soner
being naturally fierce and haughty, at∣tempted
to draw upon the bailiffs, who disarmed
him in a twinkling; and this effort served only
to heighten his disgrace, which was witnessed by a
thousand people, most of whom laughed very hear∣tily,
at the adventure of a lord's being arrested.</P>
<P>Such a public transaction could not long escape
the knowledge of his father, who (that very day)
had the satisfaction to hear that his son was in a
spunging-house. In consequence of this informa∣tion
he sent his steward to learn the particulars of
the arrest, and was equally offended, surprized,
and concerned, when he understood the nature
of the debt, which he imagined his son had al∣ready
discharged. Unwilling to pay such a con∣siderable
sum for a spendthrist, whom he had but
too much indulged, and who in less than one
week might involve himself in such another dif∣ficulty,
the old gentleman wrote a letter to Pe∣regrine,
<PB N="292" REF="295"/>
representing what a hardship it would be
upon him to forfeit such sums by the indiscretion
of a son, whose engagements he was not bound
to fulfil, and desiring some mitigation in his de∣mand,
as it was not a debt contracted for value
received, but incurred without subjecting him
to the least damage or inconvenience.</P>
<P>Our adventurer no sooner received this letter,
than he went in person to wait upon the author,
to whom he, in a candid manner, related the
particular circumstances of the match, together
with the ingratitude and audacity of his son, which
he owned had stimulated him to such measures as
he, otherwise, would have scorned to take. The
nobleman acknowledged, that the revenge was
hardly adequate to the provocation, and con∣demned
the conduct of his son with such justice
and integrity, as disarmed Peregrine of his re∣sentment,
and disposed him to give an undoubted
proof of his own disinterestedness, which he im∣mediately
exhibited, by producing the note, and
tearing it to pieces, after having assured his lord∣ship,
that the writ should be withdrawn, and the
prisoner discharged before night.</P>
<P>The earl, who perfectly well understood the
value of money, and was no stranger to the cha∣racters
of mankind, stood amazed at this sacrifice
which Pickle protested was offered by his esteem
for his lordship; and after having complimented
him upon his generosity, in a very uncommon
strain of encomium, begg'd the favour of his ac∣quaintance,
and insisted upon his dining wi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h him
next day. The youth, proud of having met
with such an opportunity to distinguish himself,
in less than an hour performed every article of his
promise; and in the morning was visited by the
<PB N="293" REF="296"/>
debtor, who came, by the express order of his
father, to thank him for the obligation under
which he was laid, and ask pardon for the offence
he had given.</P>
<P>This condescension was very glorious for our
hero, who graciously received his submission,
and accompanied him to dinner, where he was
caressed by the old earl with marks of particular
affection and esteem. Nor was his gratitude con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed
to exterior civility; he offered him the use
of his interest at court, which was very power∣ful,
and repeated his desire of serving him so
pressingly, that Peregrine thought he could not
dispense with the opportunity of assisting his ab∣sent
friend God<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rey, in whose behalf he begg'd
the influence of his lordship.</P>
<P>The earl, pleased with this request, which
was another proof of the young gentleman's be∣nevolence,
said, he would not fail to pay the ut∣most
regard to his recommendation; and in six
weeks a captain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s commission was actually signed
for the brother of Emilia, who was very agreeably
surprized at the intimation he received from the
war-office, though he was utterly ignorant of the
canal through which he obtained that promotion.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="93" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XCIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Peregrine is celebrated as a wit and patron, and
proceeds to entertain himself at the expence of
whom it did concern.</HEAD>
<P>IN the mean time, Peregrine flourished in the
gay scenes of life, and (as I have already
observed) had divers opportunities of profiting in
the way of marriage, had not his ambition been
<PB N="294" REF="297"/>
a little too inordinate, and his heart still biassed
by a passion, which all the levity of youth could
not balance, nor all the pride of vanity overcome.
Nor was our hero unmarked in the world of let∣ters
and taste: he had signalized himself in se∣veral
poetical productions, by which he had ac∣quired
a good share of reputation; not that the
pieces were such as ought to have done much ho∣nour
to his genius; but any tolerable perfor∣mance
from a person of his figure and supposed
fortune, will always be considered, by the bulk of
readers, as an instance of astonishing capacity;
though the very same production, ushered into
the world with the name of an author in less
affluent circumstances, would be justly disregarded
and despised; so much is the opinion of most peo∣ple
influenced and over-awed by ridiculous con∣siderations.</P>
<P>Be this as it will, our young gentleman was no
sooner distinguished as an author, than he was
marked out as a patron, by all the starving retainers
to poetry: he was solemnized in odes, celebrated
in epigrams, and fed with the milk of soft dedica∣tion.
His vanity even relished this incense; a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d
though his reason could not help despising those
that offered it, not one of them was sent away,
unowned by his muni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icence. He began to think
himself, in good earnest, that superior genius
which their flattery had described; he cultivated
acquaintance with the wits of fashion, and even
composed in secret a number of <HI>b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns mots,</HI> which
he uttered in company as the impromptu's of his
imagination. In this practice indeed, he imitated
some of the most renowned geniuses of the age,
who (if the truth were known) have l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>boured in
secret, with the sweat of their brows, for many a
<PB N="295" REF="298"/>
repartee which they have vended as the imme∣diate
production of fancy and expression. He was
so successful in this exercise of his talents, that
his same actually came in competition with that of
a great man, who had long sat at the helm of
wit; and in a dialogue that once happened be∣tween
them, on the subject of a cork-screw,
wherein the altercation was discharged (according
to Bayes) slap for slap, dash for dash, our hero
was judged to have the better of his lordship, by
some of the minor satellites, that commonly sur∣round
and reflect the rays of such mighty lumi∣naries.</P>
<P>In a word, he dipped himself so far in these li∣terary
amusements, that he took the management
of the pit into his direction, putting himself at
the head of those critics who call themselves the
town; and in that capacity chastised several play∣ers,
who had been rendered insolent and refrac∣tory
by unmerited success. As for the new pro∣ductions
of the stage, though generally unspirited
and insipid, they always enjoyed the benefit of his
influence and protection; because he never disliked
the performance so much as he sympathized with
the poor author, who stood behind the scenes in
the most dreadful suspence, trembling, as it were,
on the very brink of damnation: yet, though he
extended his generosity and compassion to the
humble and needy, he never let slip one oppor∣tunity
of mortifying villainy and arrogance. Had
the executive power of the legislature been vested
in him, he would have doubtless devised strange
species of punishment for all offenders against hu∣manity
and decorum; but, restricted as he was,
he employed his invention in subjecting them to
the ridicule and contempt of their fellow subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="299"/>
It was with that view he set on foot the scheme
of conjuration, which was still happily carried on,
and made use of the intelligence of his friend
Cadwallader; though he sometimes converted this
advantage to the purposes of gallantry, being (as
the reader may have perceived) of a very amorous
complexion. He not only acted the re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ormer, or
rather the castigator, in the fashionable world, but
also exercised his talents among the inferior class
of people, who chanced to incur his di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>spl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> asure.</P>
<P>Being one day insulted by a couple of chair∣men,
who demanded more than their fare, he
took particular notice of their number; and next
day, Pipes, being dressed in one of his old suits,
went by his direction to a coffee-house near their
stand, after he had loaded himself with an addi∣tional
weight, amounting to an hundred pounds
at least; and calling the same individual partners
who had affronted his master, he took possession
of their chair, and ordered them to carry him to
a place at the distance of two long miles. The
burthen was so extraordinary, that when they at∣tempted
to take him up, they imag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ned the ve∣hicle
was detained by some crack or crevice of the
pavement, and one of them actually went to disen∣gage
it; but finding it clear, he began a song of
imprecations upon his fare, who he swore had got
a backside of block-tin; but, being obliged to ac∣complish
his undertaking, he bent his shoulders
once more to the lead, bidding his comrade lift
fair and be damn'd. The task was not performed
in silence; while they staggered along, he cursed
in a strain peculiar to himself, and in vain ende<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣voured
to provoke the patient Pipes with oppro∣brious
language, hoping that he would either dis∣miss
them from his service, or be so incensed at
<PB N="297" REF="300"/>
his abuse, as to proceed to manual chastisement;
in which case, the fellow would have an oppor∣tunity
of gratifying his choler upon the author of
his present grievance. Finding, however, that
the gentleman bore his reproaches with the most
philosophic indifference, he lost all patience; and
being restrained, by the fear of the law, from an
assault upon his fare, he turned the stream of his
indignation upon his own partner, who, he al∣ledged,
did not bear his share of the burthen.
This imputation created a dispute, which was
maintained on both sides with such virulence of
obloquy, as produced a quarrel, and mutual de∣fiance
to single combat, on the spot.</P>
<P>The chair was accordingly set down, without
ceremony, the antagonists stripped themselves in
a moment; and a fierce battle ensuing, Peregrine,
who followed at a distance, enjoyed the pleasure
of seeing them both beaten almost to jelly, be∣fore
the contest was determined. As for Pipes,
he sat still, and viewed the engagement with great
composure; and perceiving his carriers disabled
by their mutual prowess and perseverance, opened
the chair, and very de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberately walked home to
his master's lodging, where he disincumbered him∣self
of his load.</P>
<P>A few days after the atchievement of this ex∣ploit,
one of our hero's friends, who lodged at
the house of an old peevish puritanical widow,
that kept an hosier's shop, was obl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to quit
his apartment at a minute's warning, because he
had scandal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zed the house, by treating a female
co<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sin at supper over-night. On this occasion, a
great deal of sharp repartee had passed between
him and his landlady, who not only subjected him
to infinite inconvenience, from such a precipitate
<PB N="298" REF="301"/>
removal, but had likewise given her tongue such
disagreeable liberties, at his expence, that he
vowed revenge, and now sollicited the advice and
assistance of his friend. Pickle having inquired
into the character of the delinquent, who was
hated by her neighbours, for her insolent and
fretful disposition, undertook the cause of his com∣panion,
to whom he dictated the following adver∣tisement,
which was immediately inserted in one
of the news-papers: “Any person possessed of a
male black cat, with white feet, and a b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y tail,
not exceeding the age of two or three years, will
find a purchaser, by carrying it to the sign of the
kid near St. James's.”</P>
<P>The projector and his associate having obtained
the promise of the publisher, that this intimation
should appear next day, went early in the morn∣ing
to a public house, and occupying a room,
the windows of which fronted the hosier's door,
sat with joyful expectation to see the effect of
their scheme, which soon yielded them all the sa∣tisfaction
they could desire. The shop was no
sooner opened, than it was surrounded by a great
number of the Cannaille, who having heard the
advertisement read in ale-houses, came (each with
a cat under his arm) in hopes of making an ad∣vantageous
bargain; for though many of them
were too inconsiderable to produce such an ani∣mal
of their own property, they had made free
with the first cats they could pick up, and every
one repair<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with all possible dispatch to the ap∣pointed
place, with a view of foresta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing the
market; so that, in disputing the precedence, the
whole crew went to loggerheads about the door,
to the utter astonishment of the shopkeeper, who
could not conceive the meaning of such a congre∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="302"/>
Nevertheless, she began to harangue them in
her usual stile, which was not the mildest sort of
expostulation; and one of the multitude, who
found means to detach himself from the general
uproar and confusion, told her, he had brought
a cat, which, he supposed, would answer the
marks of her advertisement. “Here, (said he,
presenting the creature) look at him, mistress;
I'll be damn'd if you ever saw a finer boar in
your life. Do but mind his tu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s and his ta<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l;
his tail is for all the world like a squirrel's, and
yet he's no more than a kitten; I'm the son of a
bitch, if he's a day more than six months old.”
This address, while it compleated her amaze∣ment,
ki<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dled her rage to such a degre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, that she
spit in his <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ace, calling him a cat, and a rat, and
a rascal; and shutting the hatch, threatened the
whole assembly with Br<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dewell and imprisonment,
if they would not immediately disperse. Her de∣clamation
was so shr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, as to command the at∣tention
of the whole audience, who finding their
hopes frustrated, and hearing themselves so bit∣terly
reviled, put an end to their own jars, and
held a momentary conference; in consequence of
which, one of them was deputed to ask, whether
or not she had advertised for a black cat. This
question being answered in the negative, with a
string of reproachful epithets, the interrogator ap∣proaching
the do<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r, “Why, ye bitch of B<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
(said he) if you won't give m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ney for my ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,
you shall have him for love.” With those words
he threw it into the shop, and retired; while his
brethren, in obedience to this signal, lifted up
their hands as one man, and like soldiers at the
word of command, discharged about forty cats at
the same instant of time, upon the con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>d
<PB N="300" REF="303"/>
hosier, who finding herself overwhelmed by such
a number of animals, which she looked upon as
so many fiends sent to torment her, ran aghast into
the street with dismal outcries, imploring the as∣sistance
of her neighbours, who (as well as our
confederates) enjoyed her distress; and after hav∣ing
indulged their animosity, contributed their aid,
in ridding her of such a dangerous annoyance.</P>
<P>The next mischievous plan that entered our
hero's imagination, was suggested by two adver∣tisements
published in the same paper, by persons
who wanted to borrow certain sums of money,
for which they promised to give undeniable secu∣rity.
Peregrine, from the stile and manner of
both, concluded they were written by attornies,
a species of people for whom he entertained his
uncle's aversion: and in order to amuse himself,
and some of his friends, with their disappoint∣ment,
he wrote a letter signed A. B. to each ad∣vertiser,
according to the address specified in the
news-paper, importing, that if he would come
with his writings, to a certain coffee-house near
the Temple, precisely at six o'clock in the even∣ing,
he would find a person sitting in the right-hand
box, next to the window, who would be
glad to treat with him about the subject of his ad∣vertisement,
and, should his security be liked,
would accommodate him with the sum which he
wanted to raise. Before the hour of this double
appointment, Pickle with his friend Cadwallader,
and a few more gentlemen, to whom he had
thought proper to communicate the plan, went to
the coffee-house, and seated themselves near the
place that was destined for their meeting.</P>
<P>The hope of getting money had such an evident
effect upon their punctuality, that one of them
<PB N="301" REF="304"/>
arrived a considerable time before the hour; and
having reconnoitred the room, took his station
according to the direction he had received, fixing
his eye upon a clock that stood before him, and
asking of the bar-keeper if it was not too slow. He
had not remained in this posture many minutes,
when he was joined by a strange figure, that
waddled into the room, with a bundle of papers in
his bosom, and the sweat running over his nose.
Seeing a man in the box to which he had been
directed, he took it for granted he was the lender;
and as soon as he could recover his breath, which
was almost exhausted by the dispatch he had made,
“Sir, (said he) I presume you are the gentleman
I was to meet, about that loan.”—Here he
was interrupted by the other, who eagerly re∣plied,
“A. B. Sir, I suppose.” “The same,
(cried the last comer) I was afraid I should be
too late; for I was detained beyond my expecta∣tion,
by a nobleman in the other end of the
town, that wants to mortgage a small trifle of his
estate, about a thousand a year; and my watch
happens to be in the hands of the maker, having
met with an accident a few nights ago, which set
it asleep. But howsomever, there's no time lost,
and I hope this affair will be transacted to the sa∣tisfaction
of us both. For my own part, I love
to do good offices myself, and therefore I expect
nothing but what is fair and honest of other
people.”</P>
<P>His new friend was exceedingly comforted by
this declarati<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, which he considered as a happy
omen of his success; and the hope of fingering
the cash operated visibly in his countenance,
while he expressed his satisfaction at meeting with
a person of such candour and humanity. “The
<PB N="302" REF="305"/>
pleasure (said he) of dealing with an easy conscien∣tious
man, is, in my opinion, superior to that of
touching all the money upon earth; for what joy
can be compared with what a generous mind
feels, in bef<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iending its fellow-creatures? I was
never so happy in my life, as at one time, in
lending five hundred pounds to a worthy gentleman
in distress, without insisting upon rigid security.
Sir, one may easily distinguish an upright man by
his countenance; for example now, I think I
could take your word for ten thousand pounds.”
The other with great joy protested, that he was
right in his conjecture, and returned the compli∣ment
a thousand fold: by which means, the ex∣pectation
of both was wound up to a very inter∣esting
pitch; and both, at the same instant, be∣gan
to produce their papers, in the un<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying of
which, their hands shook with transports of ea∣gerness
and impatience; while their eyes were so
intent upon their work, that they did not per∣ceive
the occupation of each other.</P>
<P>At length, one of them, ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing got the start
of the other, and unrolled several skins of musty
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hment, directed his view to the employment
of his friend; and seeing him fumbling at his
bundle, asked if that was a blank bond and con∣veyance,
which he had brought along with him.
The other, without lifting up his eyes, or de∣sisting
from his endeavours to loose the knot,
which by this time he had applied to his teeth,
answered this question in the negative, observing,
that the papers in his hand were the security which
he proposed to give for the money.</P>
<P>This reply converted the looks of the inquirer
into a stare of infini<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e stolidity, accompanied with
the word, <HI>Anan!</HI> which he pronounced in a t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ne
<PB N="303" REF="306"/>
of fear and astonishment. The other, alarmed
at this note, cast his eyes towards the supposed
lender, and was in a moment infected by his as∣pect.
All the exultation of hope that sparkled in
their eyes, was now succeeded by disappointment
and dismay; and while they gazed ruefully at
each other, their features were gradually elon∣gated,
like the transient curls of a Middle-row
periwig.</P>
<P>This emphatic silence was, however, broke
by the last comer, who, in a faultering accent,
desired the other to recollect the contents of his
letter. “Of your letter!” cried the first, putting
into his hand the advertisement he had received
from Pickle; which he had no sooner perused,
than he produced his own, for the satisfaction of
the other party: so that another gloomy pause
ensued, at the end of which, each uttered a pro∣found
sigh, or rather groan, and rising up, sneak'd
off, without farther communication; he who
seemed to be the most afflicted of the two, taking
his departure, with an exclamation of “Hum∣bugged,
egad!”</P>
<P>Such were the amusements of our hero, tho'
they did not engross his whole time, some part
of which was dedicated to nocturnal riots and re∣vels,
among a set of young noblemen, who had
denounced war against temperance, oeconomy,
and common sense, and were indeed the devoted
sons of tumult, waste, and prodigality. Not
that Peregr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e relished those scenes, which were
a succession of absurd extravagance, devoid of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
true spirit, taste, or enjoyment: but his vanity
prompted him to mingle with those who were
intitled the choice spirits of the age; and his dis∣position
was so pliable, as to ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt itself easily to
<PB N="204" REF="307"/>
the measures of his company, where he had not
influence enough to act in the capacity of director.
Their rendezvous was at a certain tavern, which
might be properly stiled the temple of excess,
where they left the choice of their fare to the
discretion of the landlord, that they might save
themselves the pains of exercising their own rea∣son;
and, in order to avoid the trouble of ad∣justing
the bill, ordered the waiter to declare how
much every individual must pay, without speci∣fying
the articles of the charge; and this propor∣tion
generally amounted to two guineas <HI>per</HI> head
for each dinner and supper, and frequently ex∣ceeded
that sum; of which the landlord durst
not abate, without running the risque of having
his nose slit for his moderation.</P>
<P>But this was a puny expence, compared with
that which they often incurred, by the damage
done to the furniture and servants, in the mad∣ness
of their intoxication, as well as the loss they
sustained at hazard, an amusement to which all
of them had recourse, in the progress of their
debauches. This elegant diversion was intro∣duced,
encouraged, and promoted by a crew of
rapacious sharpers, who had made themselves ne∣cessary
companions to this hopeful generation,
by the talents of pimping and buffoonery: and
though they were universally known, even by
those they preyed upon, to have no other means
of earning their livelihood, than the most in∣famous
and fraudulent practices, they were ca∣ressed
and cou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted by these infatuated dupes, when
a man of honour, who would not join in their
excesses, would have been treated with the ut∣most
indignity and contempt.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="308"/>
Though Peregrine, in his heart, detested those
abandoned courses, and was a professed enemy to
the whole society of gamesters, whom he con∣sidered,
and always treated as the foes of human
kind, he was insensibly accustomed to licentious
riot, and even led imperceptibly into play by
those cormorants, who are no less dangerous in
the art of cheating, than by their consummate
skill in working upon the passions of unwary
youth. They are, for the most part, naturally
cool, phlegmatic and cra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty, and by a long habit
of dissimulation, have gained an absolute domi∣nion
over the hasty passions of the heart; so that
they engage with manifest advantage over the im∣patience
and impetuosity of a warm, undesigning
temper, like that of our young gentleman, who,
when he was heated with wine, misled by ex∣ample,
invited on one hand, and defied on the
other, forgot all his maxims of caution and so∣briety,
and plunging into the reigning folly of
the place, had frequent occasions to moralize in the
morning, upon the loss of the preceding night.</P>
<P>These penitential reflections were attended with
many laudable resolutions of profiting by the ex∣pence
which he had so dearly purchased; but he
was one of those philosophers, who always put
off, till another day, the commencement of their
reformation.</P>
