<HEAD>PROGRESS
OF
FLAX-HUSBANDRY
IN
SCOTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>AS the power of a state consists chiefly
in the number and industry of its
people, every thing must be of im∣portance
that contributes to these ends. This
observation puts the linen manufacture in a
conspicuous light; for it employs many
hands, and requires the most painful indu∣stry.
In Scotland, this manufacture, which,
within the memory of man, scarce deserved
the name, has of late years made a progress so
rapid, as to become our chief manufacture,
circulating more money than all our other
manufactures in conjunction. Nor is there
any symptom of its being stationary: on the
contrary, it is every year boldly advancing
with wider and wider steps.</P>
<P>This prospect must be agreeable to every
<PB N="4" REF="3"/>
well-hearted Briton; and to gratify the lau∣dable
curiosity of such persons, the follow∣ing
brief account of the progress of the ma∣nufacture
is presented. The board of Tru∣stees
was established <HI>anno</HI> 1727; the value of
the linen stamped from November 1727 to
November 1728, not including what was
made for private use,

<P>Though the progress of the linen manu∣facture
in general is not the professed pur∣pose
of this paper, yet I shall endeavour to
account for it, as a proper introduction to a
historical narrative of the measures taken by
the Trustees for promoting our flax-husband∣ry.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4"/>
The union of the two crowns of England
and Scotland, was a fatal event for the latter.
The great increase of power which our kings
thereby acquired, reduced the Scotch nobility
to a state of humble dependence. From being
petty monarchs, they became slaves to the
crown, and had nothing left to support their
accustomed dignity, but, under protection of
the crown, to enslave their inferiors. The na∣tional
spirit, bold and brave, subsided by de∣grees;
and a general torpor succeeded, the
never-failing effect of slavery. Though resto∣red
to liberty and independence, by the u∣nion
of the two nations, yet mutual jealousy
and enmity obstructed long the advantages
of our new situation. At length the blessings
of liberty and independence became conspi∣cuous,
and invigorated multitudes to exert
themselves in laudable undertakings. And
hence that spirit for improvement in Scot∣land,
displayed upon husbandry, upon ma∣nufactures,
upon commerce, and upon lite∣rature.</P>
<P>The establishing a board of Trustees for
directing this national spirit, upon fisheries,
and upon the manufactures of linen and
woollen, was a measure wise and political,
zealously promoted by a worthy patriot, who
<PB N="6" REF="5"/>
was rewarded, by the opportunity he long
had of serving his country, as an eminent
member of that board. His statue was erect∣ed
in the senate-house, by those of his own
profession, in token of their veneration for
him, as a judge above all corruption. From
his fellow-citizens in general a statue was not
less due, as a token of their gratitude for
his patriotism.</P>
<P>But whatever was his zeal for the public
good, and whatever zeal he inspired into
others, yet the operations of that board were
not at first attended with great success. The
indolence and ignorance of the low people,
and their want of honesty, could not be cured
but by perseverance and artful management.
But unluckily we were at that time ill pro∣vided
with political physicians, skilled in the
cure: which is always the case in a country
where industry is dead, and no person thinks
of it. The Trustees were forced for some
time to grope in the twilight of knowledge:
they frequently mistook their road, and ad∣opted
measures that were not always ade∣quate
to the ends proposed. But, as the in∣tendment
of this paper is neither to make a
satire nor encomium upon the Trustees, it
shall only be observed in passing, that the ig∣norance
<PB N="7" REF="6"/>
of this nation with respect to manu∣factures,
and with respect to the means of
promoting them, may well excuse the few
errors committed by the Trustees at the
commencement of their management; and
that these errors ought not to derogate from
their merit, in serving their country without
the slightest motive of private interest.</P>
<P>The Trustees, having with great assiduity
surmounted endless difficulties and obstruc∣tions,
were encouraged to redouble their di∣ligence.
The people are in a measure reclaim∣ed
from idleness and dishonesty: industry is
gaining ground, and is spreading even to di∣stant
corners: spinners and weavers, greatly
multiplied, are daily acquiring more and
more skill: many bleachfields are perfected,
and the colour of our linens is much impro∣ved;
nor have water-mills been neglected for
dressing flax of our own growth; though
these, after much expence bestowed, do not
now give general satisfaction.</P>
<P>These expensive articles drew great sums
from the Trustees; so great, that little was
left for promoting other branches. But these
articles being now far advanced, so as not to
require much further support, it is the inten∣tion
of the Trustees to promote the growth of
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
our own flax with their utmost assiduity.
This appears the proper time for encouraging
that capital article, because a market is now
provided for it, <HI>viz.</HI> a home market, which
of all is the best; and no person can doubt of
this market when he is informed, that foreign
flax to the amount of <HI>L.</HI> 110,000 is yearly
imported into Scotland.</P>
<P>The saving this annual sum to the nation,
is not the only, nor indeed the greatest bene∣fit
that will accrue by promoting flax-hus∣bandry.
A manufacture cannot but be upon
a precarious footing, when recourse must be
had to a foreign market for the crude mate∣rials;
and a nation must be upon a pre∣carious
footing, when it is in the power
of foreigners, with a single <HI>Fiat,</HI> to starve a
great proportion of its people, by withdrawing
from them the means of labour. This obser∣vation
is in part unhappily verified by the
present state of our flax-commerce; for fo∣reign
flax has, within these seven years, been
gradually so much raised upon us, that we
pay now for it fifty <HI>per cent.</HI> more than for∣merly.
<HI>2dly,</HI> For a further encouragement
to raise flax, the farmer may be assured, that
our own flax, when skilfully managed, and
the ground well prepared, is tough, compact,
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
and smooth; and consequently, for thread,
lace, gauze, cambric, and lawn, is better
fitted than that of Holland, which generally
is spungy and cottony. Scotch flax, when
brought to its utmost perfection, may proba∣bly
rival even that of Flanders. It is too
good for Osnaburgs, which require coarse
Russian flax. The Dutch flax is only prefer∣able
for thick hollands. <HI>3dly,</HI> All the labour
bestowed upon foreign flax purchased by us,
in preparing the ground, in sowing and pull∣ing,
in watering, grasing, and dressing for
the heckle, is paid for by us. What a bene∣fit
to this nation must it be, to give bread to
numbers of our own people, by employing
them in that work? <HI>4thly,</HI> As a considerable
proportion of the flax we use is of foreign
growth, and as the heckler and the spinner
must pay money for it, the one is disposed
to over-heckle it, and the other to draw it out
into too fine yarn, in order to make the most
of their money. This evil would be in a
good measure prevented by having flax in
plenty of our own growth; for the heckler
and spinner would in that case use it freely,
without labouring to draw it beyond its
grist.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9"/>
The Trustees, for these reasons, cannot di∣rect
their management to a more important
object than to that of flax-raising. This in∣deed
they had early in view, though they did
not always hit upon the most effectual means.
They brought flax-raisers and flax-dressers
from Holland, Flanders, and England: they
published directions for raising flax: they
laid out money for breeding apprentices to
flax-raising and flax-dressing: they encoura∣ged
the erection of lint-mills; gave salaries
to stationed raisers and dressers of flax, and
distributed heckles. The article last men∣tioned
did good, and continues to do good:
but most of the other articles were less suc∣cessful
than was expected; because the Tru∣stees,
inflamed with the spirit of patriotism,
made a more rapid progress than was con∣sistent
with the circumstances of the country.
For one instance, it seldom happens that the
best artists are moved by the hope of greater
gain to desert their native country; and
therefore to send some hopeful young men
abroad to be thoroughly perfected in the art,
is a measure more slow indeed, but always
more successful. And had this method been
followed, the superior skill of the men thus
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
educated would have procured them good
bread, without burdening the public fund
with salaries. By neglecting this safe mea∣sure,
there were few or no skilful persons
that could be employed as stationary raisers
and dressers of flax; and the Trustees were
forced to take up with such persons as could
procure the best recommendations; which
generally proceeded from interested motives.
The negligence, accordingly, and unskilful∣ness
of these persons, ruined all.</P>
<P>One of the encouragements for flax-raising,
was a premium of fifteen shillings upon every
acre prepared for flax-seed according to a me∣thod
prescribed. This premium was in ef∣fect
putting the plough before the horses. It
indeed excited many to sow lint-seed; but it
was soon discovered, and might have been
foreseen, that it was no sufficient encourage∣ment,
without providing a market for the
flax when separated from the ground. The
premium was not the half of the price of the
seed: the product lay upon the farmer's
hand, who had neither skill nor people for
dressing it with stock and hand, lint-mills be∣ing
at that time extremely rare; and, by
these means, he was upon the whole a great
loser by this premium.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11" MS="y"/>
Lint-boors came next in play, by a hint
taken from Holland and Flanders. The lint-boors
there purchase all the green lint in the
neighbourhood, water and grase it, and, in
a word, prepare it for the spinner. This
measure had a fair appearance; the Trustees
were fond of it, and gave great encourage∣ment
for carrying it into execution. But
this measure proved abortive; and it could
not happen otherwise. It was not adverted
to, that the culture of flax had subsisted in
Holland and Flanders for centuries; and that
considerable stocks were acquired by dealing
in the different branches of the manufacture;
part of which could not be better employed
than in the lucrative trade of a lint-boor, sur∣rounded
with lint-fields, that save the expence
of carriage. In Scotland every article was
opposite. The manufacture was still in its
infancy: no provision of skilful hands: lint-fields
were thinly scattered; and it was a
great burden upon the lint-boor to carry so
weighty a crop from a great distance: no
person had a stock for building houses, pre∣paring
canals, <HI>&amp;c.;</HI> and had there been such
persons, they would not have stooped to an
inferior branch, while the higher branches
lay open to employ their money upon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12"/>
The water-mills mentioned above, having
a specious appearance, met with vigorous en∣couragement,
and exhausted a great deal of
public money. They were favourites of the
country-people, by saving labour in dressing
the flax; of which those were the most sen∣sible
who were acquainted with the slowness
and fatigue of the stock and hand. It was
not doubted but that these mills would in∣cline
every farmer to raise flax; and the Tru∣stees
were intent to accelerate that effect. A
premium was notified of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI>
stone for dressed flax of our own growth;
which was confined to the three great linen
counties of Perth, Fife, and Angus, because
the public fund was not adequate to a more
general premium. The success of this mea∣sure
has been considerable; and would have
been still more considerable, had a sufficient
number of skilful flax-raisers been provided
to instruct the country-people. The demand
for foreign flax has greatly subsided in these
counties; and in a few years will probably
vanish altogether. This premium is now
transferred to the counties of Lanark, Air,
Renfrew, Dumbarton, and Stirling, where it
will certainly produce the same beneficial ef∣fects;
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
and the intention is, to carry it progres∣sively
through the kingdom.</P>
<P>For the same purpose of promoting flax-rai∣sing,
quantities of lint-seed have been distri∣buted,
mostly in the Highlands, at first <HI>gra∣tis,</HI>
and afterward under prime cost. This
measure had a good effect; but not equiva∣lent
to the sums bestowed upon it. For the
farmers were not sufficiently skilled in pre∣paring
the ground: and they were not suffi∣ciently
anxious to be instructed, because they
put little value upon seed which they got for
nothing, or at a low price.</P>
<P>To remedy this evil, and to excite a spirit
of cultivation, large premiums were given
for the greatest quantities of flax produced
upon an acre. This inflamed the industry
of the farmer, and had the effect of pro∣curing
very rich crops. Some farmers be∣came
expert in high dressing for flax-seed,
and every one was fond to receive instruc∣tion;
which was the great object of the pre∣mium.
And yet the Trustees were forced to
drop this premium, though with great re∣luctance,
before the effect was completed.
Industry was not so far advanced as to
have reclaimed entirely the labouring poor
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
from trick and deceit. The premiums were
considerable; and if, upon the one hand,
they promoted good husbandry, they, on the
other, were a temptation to practise fraudu∣lent
methods for obtaining false reports of the
quantities of flax produced. Such frauds
are infectious; and the Trustees saw no o∣ther
means to prevent the infection, but to
withdraw the bounty altogether. There is
no reason however to repent of having set
this measure on foot; for though it may not
have had the complete effect intended, it
has undoubtedly promoted skill in flax-hus∣bandry,
and has also given sufficient evidence
to the flax-farmer, that plentiful crops can be
produced by high cultivation.</P>
<P>To proceed in the history of water-mills,
experience discovered that they were attended
with many inconveniencies. The labour of
carrying rough lint to these mills from a di∣stance,
came to be felt; as also the delay of
getting the lint dressed, when the mill happens
to be much employed. At the same time,
the ordinary yield of this mill in dressed flax,
is so much inferior in quantity to that of
stock and hand, as to overbalance fully what
is saved upon labour; not to mention the
hurt that is done to the flax by the violent
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
and ill-directed action of the mill. But the
worst of all is, that the lint-miller, being un∣der
no check nor control, is tempted to de∣fraud
his customers of part of their dressed
flax: and there are instances where the whole
has been with-held from poor people, who it
was thought would not have courage to bring
a law-suit. In many places there is not suffi∣cient
house-room provided for the flax that is
brought to the mill; which, in a throng
time, is often exposed to the air for months
together before the miller can reach it. By
these means, many lint-millers, I am far
from saying the whole, are so sunk in their
credit, that the farmers in their neighbour∣hood,
rather than submit to the foregoing
hardships, chuse to abandon flax-raising alto∣gether.</P>
<P>It is peculiarly lucky for Scotland, that, du∣ring
this distressing situation, a flax-machine
has been invented, that promises not only to
remedy the said inconveniencies, but also to
advance flax-dressing to its perfection, with no
less frugality than expedition. It is wrought
by a single hand, takes up little room, is
portable in a cart, and so little expensive, that
three or four neighbouring farmers may have
one in common for a mere trifle contributed
<PB N="17" REF="16"/>
by each. Its motion, at the same time, is so
easy, and so much under command, that it is
equal to stock and hand with respect to the
yield of dressed flax, and also with respect to
the gentleness of its motions. And taking
into the account the expedition of this ma∣chine,
which performs at least thrice the work
of stock and hand, it must be pronounced a
happy invention.</P>
<P>But we have not exhausted all that can be
said in its favour, nor indeed the greater part.
It is a capital advantage, that by it the farmer
can superintend the dressing his flax without
hazard of being cheated; and, what is still
more, to get his flax dressed without a far∣thing
of charge; which may be done by the
following method. The flax is generally wa∣tered
and grased before the corn-harvest, or
at least before it turn throng; and therefore
may be done by the farm-servants, without
interrupting other work. The flax may be
housed at the end of a barn or other conveni∣ent
place till winter, when the farm-servants,
for want of light, are laid idle for some
hours in the afternoon. During this time,
the farmer and his servants cannot be more
profitably employed than in dressing their flax;
and the long nights afford more than suffi∣cient
<PB N="18" REF="17"/>
time for dressing all that will be raised
by a knot of neighbouring farmers. And
even supposing the swiftest progress of lint∣husbandry,
every farmer may afford to pur∣chase
a machine for his own use solely, which
may be employed, not only during the dark
hours of the afternoon, but frequently in
day-light, when bad weather forbids all field-operations.</P>
<P>It is difficult, I am sensible, to entice peo∣ple
to employ in labour their accustomed idle
hours; but address and perseverance will
conquer many difficulties. And to operate
this conversion of idleness into labour, there
is one means among many that cannot fail of
success. An article is commonly stipulated by
farm-servants as part of their wages, which
is, to have ground allotted them for sowing
some lint-seed. They are generally put off
with the worst soil, ill prepared: their crops
are scanty: the expence of dressing unconsci∣onable:
and stating every article by a just
calcul, lint purchased at a market would
come cheaper to them than what they thus
procure. To engage them to work at the ma∣chine,
no more is necessary but that the
farmer take them in as partners. He has, for
example, one hogshead of lint-seed; they ano∣ther
<PB N="19" REF="18"/>
among them. Let it be all sown pro∣miscuously
in the same field; upon which,
for his own sake, the farmer will bestow the
highest dressing. It is watered in common,
grased in common, and dressed in common.
When a division is made in proportion to the
quantities sown, the poor labourers will re∣joice
in a double increase, purchased with a
little additional labour, without any expence.
Far from grudging this labour, their conve∣ning
together in one place, with a fire for dry∣ing
the flax, will afford them high amuse∣ment.
Their labour will be easy, being di∣vided
among many hands, and it is fit that
the farmer encourage them by taking part in
the labour. A little care, at the same time,
with proper lanterns, such as are used in
heckling, will remove all hazard of fire; e∣specially
if the farmer himself take a narrow
survey every evening when the servants leave
off work.</P>
<P>Though the dressing of flax by this ma∣chine
requires not more skill than by stock
and hand, yet to show the management of
it, particularly the dexterous handling of
the flax, and to instruct the country-people
in the preceding articles of chusing and pre∣paring
ground, weeding, pulling, watering,
<PB N="20" REF="19"/>
and grasing, it must be of consequence that
the Trustees educate and employ in different
parts a number of itinerants. This method
of having the flax dressed by the country-ser∣vants
in their otherwise idle hours, is far su∣perior
to that of lint-boors, even supposing
we were ripe for these artists; because by no
other means is it possible to get flax dressed
without expence, and indeed without any la∣bour
that can be reckoned upon. The ex∣pence
of dressing has hitherto been a bulky
article; and, considering the waste occasioned
by water-mills, is perhaps not under 40 <HI>per
cent.</HI> of the flax; all of which may be saved
by the machine under consideration.</P>
<P>Though few of the measures laid down by
the Trustees for promoting flax-husbandry,
have corresponded to the sanguine hopes at
first conceived of them; yet these measures,
imperfect as they were, contributed consider∣ably
to the flax-husbandry, which is farther
advanced than is commonly thought. The va∣lue
of flax annually produced in Scotland, af∣ter
it is heckled, and ready for the spinner, may
be pretty nearly ascertained as follows. The
linen cloth now made in a year amounts to
about <HI>L.</HI> 700,000; the value of the thread
manufactured in a year cannot be less than
<PB N="21" REF="20"/>
<HI>L.</HI> 100,000; we are more uncertain about
the quantity of the linen yarn exported; but
we cannot be far wrong in stating it at ano∣ther
<HI>L.</HI> 100,000: and these articles amount
in whole to <HI>L.</HI> 900,000. The next point is, to
ascertain the value of heckled flax used in
these different articles. Taking all the diffe∣rent
kinds of linen cloth at an average, the
value of the heckled flax may be about a
third; and the proportion is rather more in
thread. Of the yarn exported, the value of
the flax cannot be much below the half.
Joining these particulars together, the value
of the heckled flax annually manufactured in
Scotland amounts to <HI>L.</HI> 316,666. Subtract
the value of the flax imported, and the price
of heckling it, which is performed at home,
computed to <HI>L.</HI> 125,000, the remainder,
<HI>L.</HI> 191,666, or <HI>L.</HI> 190,000 in round num∣bers,
is the value of the heckled flax from our
own growth.</P>
<P>The purpose of this paper is, to encourage
land-holders and farmers to apply vigorously
to flax-raising, which, from what is said a∣bove,
will appear equally beneficial to them∣selves
and to their country. The Trustees
struggled at first with many difficulties; the
ignorance, the idleness, the indocility of the
<PB N="22" REF="21"/>
people. But happily these difficulties are in a
measure surmounted. There are not wanting
hands expert in raising and dressing flax;
and the Trustees are bent upon increasing
their number. To deal in this article, the en∣couragement
must be great, when there is a
market at home; and there must always be
such a market while importation continues.
The late premiums for the greatest quantity
of flax upon an acre, have spread the art of
preparing land for flax-seed; and reiterated
experiments of the great produce of flax
from high dressing, must rouse every farmer.
The bounty of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> stone for
dressed flax, though limited to a few coun∣ties,
will in time make its progress through
every county; and farmers, if they regard
their interest, will early prepare for receiving
the benefit of this bounty when it reaches
them. But of all encouragements for flax-raising,
that of the new machine is in reality
the greatest; by preventing a great waste of
flax, by rescuing farmers out of the fraudu∣lent
hands of lint-millers, and by saving an
endless expence formerly laid out for bring∣ing
lint to the heckle. In using this machine,
a farmer superintends the dressing his own
flax; it is done by his own servants when
<PB N="23" REF="22"/>
they cannot be otherwise employed; and it
is done without expence. A crop of flax, of
all the most lucrative, will by these means
pay a considerable part of the rent, and
make quicker returns of money than most o∣ther
crops. Nor ought it to be overlooked,
that the finding employment for servants
when they would otherwise be idle, comes to
the same with lessening their wages. The
Trustees will scatter a few of these machines
<HI>gratis</HI> in different quarters to serve as models.
The machine is of easy construction, and
can be correctly copied by any good work∣man.</P>
<P>It is zealously to be wished, and may rea∣sonably
be expected, that flax-raising will be
greatly promoted by this machine, and will
creep into every corner. But there is some∣thing
still wanting to complete the encourage∣ment;
and that is, a ready market for the flax
when it is prepared for the heckle. To that
end the Trustees will consider whether it may
not be proper to appoint lint-markets in cer∣tain
counties, where buyers and sellers may
resort; and to proclaim premiums for the
greatest quantities of flax brought by indivi∣duals
to these markets; and we cannot copy
a better model than the premiums given for
<PB N="24" REF="23"/>
improving the staple of our wool, a regula∣tion
that has a fine effect. It is submitted,
whether it may not be proper to begin with
appointing three or four markets within the
five western counties, which at present enjoy
the bounty of eighteen pence <HI>per</HI> stone for
home flax; because frauds that may be com∣mitted
in claiming the proposed premiums,
will be easily checked by the itinerant raisers
and dressers of flax appointed for instructing
the people in these counties. The Trustees
will also consider, whether it may not be use∣ful
to proclaim at the same time flax-fairs in
central places of other counties, assuring the
inhabitants of the premium in their course.</P>
<P>Having discussed flax-raising, we shall sub∣join
an appendix regarding the linen manu∣facture
in general. As this manufacture is
now advanced much beyond what is necessary
for our own consumpt, it is the duty of the
Trustees to attend to the commerce of that
commodity, and to use their endeavours to
put it upon the best footing. To form a so∣lid
judgment upon this important subject, one
must be previously acquainted with the man∣ner
in which that commerce is carried on
at present; a brief view of which is as fol∣lows.
London is our capital market: our
<PB N="25" REF="24"/>
linens are consigned to factors who sell upon
time: to them it is of little consequence what
the price be, or whether punctual payment be
made, because they remit only what money
they receive: commission and other charges
are subtracted; which, with slow payments,
is a grievous burden upon the dealers in this
country. Of a commerce carried on in this
manner, the natural and necessary effect with
respect to the dealers here, is to confine it to
those who have large stocks, and can afford to
lie out of their money. This state of our
linen-commerce must cramp the manufacture
exceedingly: it is in effect a monopoly, and
a monopoly of the very strictest kind, confi∣ning
manufacturers to the wholesale-dealer
who lives among them, or in their neigh∣bourhood;
for to try all the dealers where a
single web only is to be sold, would be a
great waste of time, with little prospect of a
better price. There are, it is true, some
petty dealers engaged in this commerce,
known by the name of <HI>hawkers,</HI> who afford
to the weaver some slight relief against this
slavish dependence. These men lay out their
small stocks in picking up linen cloth as it
comes from the loom; which they also must
sell to the wholesale-man, for they cannot af∣ford
<PB N="26" REF="25"/>
to deal directly with London. But be∣ing
better able than a weaver with a single
web, to cope with the wholesale-dealers, and
having more knowledge of the trade, they ge∣nerally
obtain a more equal price, because
they can change about if they be ill treated.
Hence it is, that these hawkers are no fa∣vourites
of the wholesale-men; which re∣markably
appeared in an application to the
board of Trustees, inveighing bitterly against
hawkers, and calling forth the vengeance of
the board upon them, as destructive to the
manufacture. It was possibly imagined, that
the Trustees might have overlooked a maxim
of which none are ignorant, viz. That the
more numerous purchasers are, the better for
the manufacture. But this incident may
justly give reason to apprehend a combina∣tion
among the wholesale-dealers to destroy
hawkers: an agreement not to purchase from
them, or to keep down the price, will pro∣duce
that effect; and, by this simple means,
the whole trade may be monopolized by the
great dealers without a competitor.</P>
<P>The plan that bids the fairest for putting
this commerce upon its most advantageous
footing, is, that there be four linen fairs held
annually at Edinburgh, as the most central
<PB N="27" REF="26"/>
place, each of them to continue four or five
days; which will naturally produce a con∣siderable
circulation of ready money, and
consequently afford the poor manufacturer
some instant relief for carrying on his busi∣ness.
We indeed can scarce hope for com∣missions
from wholesale-merchants in Lon∣don,
who have linen-drapers at hand to fur∣nish
them goods for completing their assort∣ments.
But an instance somewhat similar,
gives encouragement to hope that other
English dealers may resort to our fairs.
When the commerce of black cattle was laid
open by the union, our people carried their
droves to England: but expence of travel∣ling,
and fluctuation of markets, made this a
precarious and hazardous commerce, and
reduced to bankruptcy many of our drovers.
At length the prospect of choice and cheap∣ness
at a public market, drew down to this
country the English dealers; and now the
greater part of our cattle are sold at home
for ready money. What reason have we to
doubt, but that the English dealers will resort
to our fairs for linen, as they do for cattle?
There is no reason to doubt, provided we per∣form
our part; which is, to be industrious in
advancing our linens to their perfection. Our
<PB N="28" REF="27"/>
situation for such fairs is undoubtedly better
than that of Ireland: for, supposing other ar∣ticles
equal, an English dealer, unaccustom∣ed
and averse to sea-voyages, will never pre∣fer
a perilous navigation before a safe and
snug journey upon <HI>terra firma.</HI></P>
<P>The trouble and expence of carrying home
goods that remain unsold at a fair, have
suggested a linen-hall, as a repository for
such goods, where dealers may be provi∣ded
during the interval between two fairs.
But as it is difficult to foresee the fate of any
new project, the Trustees, sensible of former
disappointments, will probably be disinclined
to adopt any expensive plan for a linen-hall.
It is the safest course to be frugal in making
the experiment: success may encourage them
hereafter to be more bold.</P>
<P>One capital view of the plan proposed,
which can scarce fail of success, is, to rescue
the poor weavers from the oppression of the
wholesale-dealer, by affording them a choice
of markets. If the price offered by their
neighbour, the wholesale-man, be not thought
sufficient, a number of them clubbing toge∣ther
may send their goods to an Edinburgh
fair, under the care of one of themselves, or
of any trusty person. This plan will be a
<PB N="29" REF="28"/>
signal blessing to the hawkers in particular:
it will enlarge their field of action: it will
make them independent: and it will augment
their number; than which nothing can be
more beneficial to the manufacturer. Every
web is picked up as it comes from the loom,
with a view to some little profit at an ap∣proaching
fair; and in so swift a circulation,
a very slender profit will content a hawker.
This plan will be equally convenient for ped∣lers,
who, instead of painful journeys through
the country to make up their assortments,
find at hand in a fair, every sort they have oc∣casion
for. Nor need we be diffident of com∣missions
from Glasgow, Liverpool, and other
trading towns on the west coast; because the
dealers in these towns will find themselves
cheaper served here than at London.</P>
<P>These effects of the plan are obvious at first
view. But there appear other good effects,
some more, some less extensive, that cast up
upon further consideration. In the <HI>first</HI> place,
Frugal persons, who purchase for their own use,
will undoubtedly resort to the public market,
because ready money will afford them both
choice and cheapness. <HI>2dly,</HI> Buyers and sel∣lers
coming to be mutually acquainted, the
reputation of the best artists will procure
<PB N="30" REF="29"/>
them private commissions for all the linen
they make. <HI>3dly,</HI> These fairs will be a great
means for improving the fabric of our linens.
At present there is little opportunity for a
comparative trial; but here manufacturers
will soon be made sensible that they have
little chance to vend their goods if the fabric
be in any degree imperfect. <HI>Lastly,</HI> The quick
circulation of money produced by these fairs,
will enable the manufacturer to vend his
goods at the lowest price; and the current
price for ready money being thus fixed, must
have the effect to regulate in some measure
the bargains that are made upon time.</P>
<P>Every one who gives attention to what is
passing in the world, must perceive the im∣portance
of the linen manufacture to Scot∣land.
Like a stone rolled half-way up-hill,
it must be pushed to the summit, or it will
fall to the bottom, and involve all in ruin.
Honest labour and unrelenting industry will
push this manufacture to the summit, and
produce a moderate degree of opulence, with
its never-failing attendants, plenty and popu∣lation.
Opulence so acquired, being distri∣buted
through every vein of the politic body,
serves to animate every member. May Hea∣ven
avert from our thoughts the ambition of
<PB N="31" REF="30"/>
acquiring wealth independent of labour and
industry; for profuse wealth, being always
unequally distributed, never fails to sap the
foundations of virtue, to erect a throne for
luxury, and for depraved selfishness, which
reduce a nation to an abject state of degene∣racy,
and terminate in a total corruption of
manners.</P>
