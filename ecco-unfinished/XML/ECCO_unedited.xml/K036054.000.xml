Dear Jing,

This is an interesting problem; I do not think that we
have encountered it before!

It seems to me that we have *alternative versions* of several
pages. Perhaps pages from two different editions
were bound up together? All we can do is treat these
explicitly as alternative versions, and force them into
<div>s, or perhaps into embedded <text>s, to indicate that.

For the first example, the duplication around pages 43-44,
it seems that two different versions or editions of
pages 43-44 are both found in our image set.

We could use either DIVs or an embedded TEXT. Either would
work, but I think the embedded TEXT (within <P>) is a
little simpler. I suggest something like this:

<DIV TYPE="section" N="5">...
(beginning of section up to the problem bit . . . . )
(image 72, pg 42)
(image 73, pg 43)
(image 74, pg 44)
 <TEXT><BODY>
 <DIV1 TYPE="alternative version of pp 43-44">
 <PB REF="75" N="43"/>
 (image 76 = duplicate of image 74. Capture as <GAP>)
 (image 77 = duplicate of image 75. Capture as <GAP>)
 <PB REF="78" N="44"/>
 </DIV1></BODY></TEXT>
(image 79, pg 45)
... etc. ...

--------

The next problem (sect. 7) is a little different, because we
have two complete versions of an entire section. The pages need
to be reassembled in the correct order, but they all seem to be
there (note the strange sequence of image numbers). It would
probably be easiest to capture this section using subordinate
divs rather than an embedded text, like this:

<DIV1 TYPE="section" N="7">
 <DIV2 TYPE="alternative version" N="1">
 <PB REF="87" N="53"/>
 <HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>Their former Value.</HI></HEAD>

 </DIV2>

 <DIV2 TYPE="alternative version" N="2">

 <HEAD>SECTION VII. <HI>Their former Value.</HI></HEAD>

 <PB REF="95" N="57"/>
 farthings of our money ... near the Imperial aera.
 </DIV12>
</DIV1>

----

IN the next section (sect. 8), it appears that there is an
alternative version of only the first page of the section,
which makes it more like the problem at pp. 43-44.
Again I suggest using an embedded TEXT to solve the problem.
(Note that image 97 actually belongs in the previous
section, as indicated above).

In general, yes, you should ignore pages that do not
belong at all to the book. But in this case I have looked
through the image set and cannot find a stray page 4.
Do you happen to know which image it is? (i.e. the image
number or file number of the tiff?)

I hope this helps!

Yours,

Paul

<P>AN ESSAY ON MEDALS.</P>
<P>LONDON: PRINTED FOR JAMES DODSLEY IN PALL-MALL MDCCLXXXIV.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="preface">
<PB N="iii" REF="2"/>
<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the study of medals, at∣tending the other arts and sciences upon their revival in Europe, became any thing prevalent, books aiming, like this, to contain general principles of that branch of knowledge likewise appeared. In Italy, where collections of ancient coins were first formed, it was natural that works of this kind should arise. Accordingly, in 1548<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Others say 1555; they had not seen the first edition of the Giolito, Vinegia, 1548, 4to.</NOTE>, Enea Vico published his Discourses on the Medals of the Ancients; a treatise of good
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>method, and large intelligence for that pe∣riod. He therein treats of the metals em∣ployed in ancient coinage; of portraits to be found on coins; of the types on their reverses; of their legends; of medallions; of false medals, and rules for discerning them; dates of history; forms of edifices; names of magistrates, &amp;c. His example was imitated in France by Antoine le Pois, who in 1579 gave his Discourse on the Coins and Seals of the Ancients; of which the dry and verbose method is compen∣sated by the most exquisite plates which perhaps ever attended a medallic work.</P>
<P>Tho these productions had merit, yet they had an unnecessary length, and pe∣dantic formality of erudition. These faults became the more striking as science advanced, and pedantry, of consequence, began to disappear; for the latter is only the school-master of the former, and as science attains to maturity, their acquaint∣ance ceases of course. When a man is in
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>the rudiments of any knowledge, how full he is of it! how importantly he talks of it! but, as he advances, it becomes fami∣liar, and he wears it easily about him. In like manner countries have their pedantry, as well as individuals; it being the neces∣sary attendant of the introduction of science.</P>
<P>A small work therefore, which should display brief and easy instructions for the intelligence of coins, being still very much wanted, in 1665 Charles Patin, son of the celebrated Guy Patin physician to the French king, and a very skilful medallist, published his History of Medals, or Intro∣duction to that Science. This treatise, of which the last edition, 1695, is, in my opinion, much superior to the work of Jobert, next to be mentioned, ran thro many editions, and was translated into all the languages of Europe.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the high merit of this work, and its vast success, in 1692 Pere
<PB N="vi" REF="5"/>Jobert presented to the public his <HI>Science des Medailles;</HI> a title surely the most im∣pudent that ever stood at the head of any book. Patin had modestly called his an Introduction to the science; but Jobert's was the science itself; and the book cor∣responds to the title, being every way worthy of a Jesuit, and replete with the most glaring plagiarism from Patin, whom he does not mention above once. But such is the preference of impudence over modesty, that his book effectually sup∣planted that of Patin, and has stood its ground ever since, passing thro many edi∣tions, and being translated into most lan∣guages. Every bookseller will tell us, that literature is a lottery; and the obser∣vation was never more verified than in this instance. It is proper to add, that the very first edition of Jobert is the best of those published by himself; for that of 1715, which he published in two vo∣lumes, is only swelled with impertinence, and the crude reveries of Pere Hardouin,
<PB N="vii" REF="6"/>whom the author wished to flatter. The edition of 1739 is doubtless the very best; but this we owe to the editor<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. le Baron Bimard de la Bastie; the <HI>Bimardus, Bare Bimar∣dus,</HI> and <HI>Bimardus de la Bastie,</HI> of Froelich's <HI>Notitia.</HI></NOTE>, and not to the author; and even of this edition the second volume is a mere farrago of useless lumber.</P>
<P>In the very year that Jobert published his book, one, something similar, first ap∣peared in the English language<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">There is a Latin bauble, <HI>De Nummis,</HI> ascribed to our great Selden, of which he is quite innocent. It was written by Alex∣ander Sardo, of Ferrara, and published at Mentz, 1575, 4to, tho re-published at London, about 1676, by some villainous editor, under the name of <HI>Seldenus de Nummis.</HI> Labbe's <HI>Bibliotheca Nummaria</HI> is annexed to it, and they are both of a piece, and fit only to wrap pastry.</NOTE>. It's title is, <Q>The Greek and Roman History “illustrated by Coins and Medals, repre∣senting their Religions, Rites, &amp;c. &amp;c. By O. W. [Obadiah Walker]. Lon∣don, ”1692.</Q> 12mo. The work an∣swers to the title in one respect; that, of 360 pages, not 60 are medallic; the rest
<PB N="viii" REF="7"/>are all made up of Roman antiquities and history: but how it illustrates Greek his∣tory cannot be discovered. It's plan is so very confused and bad, and the whole work so feeble, that it is no wonder that it never had any success. In 1695 a trans∣lation of Jobert's work appeared, inti∣tuled, "The Knowledge of Medals," which is ascribed to Walker.</P>
<P>The <Q>Numismata, or Discourse of “”Medals, ancient and modern,</Q> by Mr. Evelyn, was printed in 1697. The size is folio, and the plan and writing are likewise in folio. That gentleman's style is so very uncouth and unintelligible, that, while he wrote upon every thing, he ought to have written about the black art only; but in this work he <HI>outdoes his former out-doings;</HI> for it is impossible for any one to know his meaning if he did not know it before. None of his observations are new, but all tacitly taken from Vico, Le Pois, Patin, and Jobert. The plates of English me∣dals
<PB N="ix" REF="8"/>are of little use, now that those of Snelling have appeared. Even they would have been better understood, had he not added explanations. There is, in the Bri∣tish Museum, a copy of this work, cor∣rected by the author, with an original let∣ter prefixed, complaining that the printer had utterly mangled and spoiled his work, so that it is necessary to give corrections. The corrections are for the worse.</P>
<P>In 1720 Nicolao Haym, an Italian fiddler, published at London his <HI>Tesoro Britannico,</HI> or British Treasury, in Italian and English; in which he proposed to en∣grave and describe, in about twelve quarto volumes, all the coins, statues, gems, &amp;c. to be found in cabinets in England, and not before made public. He has accord∣ingly given two volumes of Greek and Roman coins, with <HI>his</HI> explanations. But what explanations! If but a letter ap∣pears on a coin, he can ascertain to what name that letter belongs; if but a nose,
<PB N="x" REF="9"/>he will find a face to it; if the coin is quite bare, to divine its ancient forms costs him not a thought. Medals and au∣thors are misrepresented, as objects in the eyes of a madman. With the help of Diogenes Laertius he will find all the phi∣losophers of Greece upon old coins! Yet the reveries of this rash <HI>forsennato</HI> have been followed with much reverence by medallic writers, while to people of sense they afford laughter, and utter disgust. Khell, a German medallist of some credit, has even lately republished Haym's strange mass in Latin, with additions. But had he inspected the original medals, or known the character which that pitiful work bears here, where only it can be duly estimated, or indeed been possessed of any judgment, he would not have incurred the imputation of trying to perpetuate the gross errors of so very foolish a bauble. As Haym pre∣tends to mark the rarity, &amp;c. of many of the coins he produces, his work was en∣titled to notice here.</P>
<PB N="xi" REF="10"/>
<P>Did not my design in this preface in∣duce me to enumerate every English work, in particular, which has appeared of this kind, I should pass in silent contempt that called <Q>An Introduction to the Know∣ledge “of Medals, by the late Reverend David Jennings, D. D. printed by Bask∣erville, ”1764,</Q> 12mo. But this being the only other attempt in the language, it is necessary to mention it in few words. It consists only of about 60 pages, most of which are taken up with Jewish shekels and divinity, <HI>as in duty bound to pray.</HI> The only apology which can be made for it is, that it was drawn up by the author, as would seem, without the most distant view of publication; but was sent <HI>into the breathing world, not half made up,</HI> by some officious friend. It's innumerable blunders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To instance a few, he tells us that all ancient coins were first cast in molds, then stamped; that there were sometimes five mint∣masters; that S. C. is on all medals; that an altar on a coin of Augustus is a gate; that <HI>Votis XXX. mult. XXXX.</HI> implies a wish that the emperor may live 30 years and 40 more. He seems to say that all the Roman emperors appear with diadems. He certainly had never seen a dozen coins; nor a single medallic writer of this century.</NOTE> and holy verbosity, stamp it
<PB N="xii" REF="11"/>the most childish work which ever appear∣ed in any science whatever.</P>
<P>From this deduction the reader will per∣ceive how much a treatise of this kind was wanted, in our language in particular; tho indeed such a work has been univer∣sally known to be needed, and much wished for, during this whole century. How far the present may answer the in∣tention, or expectation, the reader must judge; tho if he does not condemn, it will not be owing to the want of previous instructions; for I am well aware that nothing is more provocative of criticism than any attempt of which the author cri∣ticises his predecessors. But, as this is a work of instruction, it was absolutely ne∣cessary to point out the faults of others, that they might be avoided.</P>
<PB N="xiii" REF="12"/>
<P>The less an author says at any time about his own productions the better; so it shall only be added, that, tho this little essay was begun as a mere amusement and relief from idleness; yet I soon found that infinite labour was required to answer my own expectations. As it is disagreeable to relinquish a design when entered upon, this toil has not been spared. Indeed the reader will hardly believe how much at∣tention is required in a work of this kind, for every page almost contains a number of minute facts, for each of which consi∣derable information is necessary: insomuch that perhaps in two or three lines the fruit of much research into a dozen or two of authors is presented. Hence mistakes are unavoidable; and tho all possible pre∣vention has been used, yet many errors may have crept in; any of which, if the reader will point out in a letter, inclosed to the care of the publisher, the admo∣nition will be most thankfully accepted;
<PB N="xiv" REF="13"/>and, should the work attain another edi∣tion, be followed by a removal of the fault.</P>
<P>They who wish to proceed in this sci∣ence may next peruse the most excellent and useful work of Froelich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Notitia Elementaris Numismatum antiquorum illorum, quae Urbium Liberarum, Regum et Principum, ac Personarum ”Illustrium, appellantur. Viennae, Pragae, et Tergesti, 1758,</Q> 4to. This work is, however, not without faults; the list of Greek cities of which we have coins is defective in about a third of the number; and the plan of splitting the series of kings of every realm into different epochs is execrable. A more minute fault is, his giving plated coins the title of <HI>bracteati,</HI> a name be∣longing to a very different kind, as the reader will see in Section XVIII. of this work. <HI>Nummi lamella argentea obducti</HI> was the proper phrase for plated coins.</NOTE>, and after∣wards such books of medals as they please, in chronological order as published, from Goltzius down to Pellerin and Combe. I scruple not to recommend Goltzius, tho all his works have many coins not yet found in cabinets, his own being unfortu∣nately lost, because medals which he de∣scribes, and which were looked upon as fictitious, are yearly found really existent,
<PB N="xv" REF="14"/>and of undoubted antiquity. A French writer compares him to Pliny the natural historian, who was thought to deal much in falsehood, till Time drew his truth out of the well; so that, as knowledge ad∣vances, most of his wonders acquire gra∣dual confirmation. For modern coins and medals, the authors who have treated those of each particular country must be consulted; the English, in particular, ap∣pear, in Snelling's Works, and Folkes's Tables, to an advantage which will not be soon surpassed.</P>
<P>As the reader may, however, expect some directions for his medallic studies, I shall beg leave to offer him a list of what authors have appeared to me the best, after a perusal of almost every work published in this line, from a duodecimo pamphlet to two volumes folio, and from the begin∣ning of the sixteenth century to the pre∣sent hour. Perhaps this estimate may be thought too severe, when the shortness of
<PB N="xvi" REF="15"/>my list is considered; but I will venture to say, that in no science whatever have so many bad books, and so few good ones, been given as in this. At the same time, if the reader wishes to enlarge his studies, he may please his fancy; all that I shall do here is, to give him a short catalogue of the best medallic productions, and the best editions of them.</P>
<P>For the general science I must recom∣mend Vico's work, <HI>Discorsi sopra le Me∣daglie de gli antichi;</HI> best editions are, <HI>Vi∣negia,</HI> 1555, 4to, and <HI>Parigi,</HI> 1622, 4to: and Patin's <HI>Histoire des Medailles, ou In∣troduction a la connoissance de cette Science;</HI> best edition is of Paris, 1695, 12mo.</P>
<P>The study of the Greek coins may be begun with Goltzius, <HI>Historia Siciliae et Magnae Graeciae ex antiquis Numismatibus,</HI> Antwerpiae, 1644, folio. Recourse may then be had to Gessner's <HI>Thesaurus Numis∣matum,</HI> Tiguri, 1738, two volumes folio.
<PB N="xvii" REF="16"/>This work contains all the Greek and Ro∣man coins published by every preceding author, and consists entirely of copper-plates, with printed explanations of only the Greek kings, tho the civic coins are likewise explained in copper-plates. The Roman medals, which compose the second volume, are not illustrated at all. It is a pity that many of the coins are not in exact order, in the beginning of the first volume, and that the author has been foolish enough to give us many of the forged coins, tho he always marks them as such; but, upon the whole, this is the best medallic work of general reference ever published<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The work of Gessner is rare, and, when met with, is very seldom complete. Such copies as have fallen in my way go no lower than Philip the son; later coins will be found in Banduri.</NOTE>. The productions of Pellerin, Paris, 1762, and following years, till 1778, ought next to be perused, mak∣ing, with all the supplements, ten quarto volumes. These volumes chiefly contain coins never before published, and are justly
<PB N="xviii" REF="17"/>held in high esteem. I believe it is to M. Pellerin that we are indebted for the first plates of medals, perfectly represent∣ing the originals in every flaw and irregu∣larity of edge and impression, which is a most capital improvement, and makes the view of such plates almost equal to that of the coins themselves. Mr. Combe's publication of Dr. Hunter's coins of Greek cities, London, 1782, 4to, as it is the last, so it is the very best of the kind ever yet given. The plan of presenting the weight, metal, and size of every coin, in marginal columns, cannot be enough praised, as every use may be made of a description so arranged that can be drawn from the coins themselves.</P>
<P>For the Greek monarchic coins Gessner may be referred to, as the most ample as∣semblage; and a few additional coins may be found in the authors mentioned in Sec∣tion II. of this work, Froelich's <HI>Notitia,</HI> and Pellerin. We must regret that the
<PB N="xix" REF="18"/>medals of Greek princes in Dr. Hunter's cabinet are not published, as they form the largest and best collection of that kind in the world, being infinitely superior to that of the French king.</P>
<P>The Roman consular coins will be found in full detail in Gessner; and those who wish for descriptions may read Vaillant's <HI>Nummi antiqui Familiarum Romanarum,</HI> Amst. 1703, 2 volumes folio; or the <HI>The∣saurus Morellianus,</HI> Amst. 1734, which is a later and a better work.</P>
<P>The imperial coins of Rome are like∣wise very amply displayed by Gessner; tho along with him, for the rare coins, should be read Vaillant's <HI>Numismata Im∣peratorum Romanorum,</HI> published by Bal∣dini at Rome, 1743, 3 volumes 4to; and Khell's <HI>Numismata Imperatorum Romano∣rum,</HI> Vindobonae, 1767, 4to, being a sup∣plement to the Roman edition of Vaillant. Banduri's <HI>Numismata Imp. Rom.</HI> Lutetiae,
<PB N="xx" REF="19"/>1718, 2 volumes folio, should likewise be perused, for the Byzantine coins in parti∣cular, being superior to the work of Du∣cange on that subject. Occo's <HI>Numismata Imp. Rom.</HI> is a good book of general refer∣ence, being only a list of all coins in every reign, digested into the years in which they were apparently struck. Occo's own second edition is the best; the additions of Mezzabarba are of dubious faith<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An authentic work on the portraits of illustrious men of an∣tiquity, drawn from coins, gems, busts, statues, &amp;c. is much want∣ed. That of Ursinus is not to be depended on; he was the Haym of a former period, and, like him, is given to substitute his own ravings for truth. The portrait of Virgil, in particular, which we now find every where, and for which we are indebted to one of the dreams of Ursinus, is only that of a Muse. A gem with∣out inscription, or attribute, was the foundation of this universal authority!</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of books on modern coins and me∣dals the first which ought to be perused by a British subject are those relating to his own country. He cannot begin better than with Mr. Clarke's <Q>Connexion of “the Roman, Saxon, and English Coins,
<PB N="xxi" REF="20"/>”London, 1767,</Q> 4to. A good work on British and Saxon coins, with prints, is much wanted; but as none now exists, let us pass to the English: and in the very first place may be recommended Mr. Lowndes's excellent <Q>Report, containing “an Essay for the Amendment of the Silver ”Coins,</Q> published by order of govern∣ment at London in 1695, 8vo; a produc∣tion, tho short, yet full of the most valua∣ble and authentic information. Then Snel∣ling's Views of English Money, London, 1763, and following years, 4to, ought to be perused, and followed by Folkes's Ta∣bles of English Coin, London, 1763, 4to, correcting the errors of either work, by means of the other. Ducarel's Letters on Anglo-Gallic Coins are very commendable, and singularly interesting to every one con∣cerned in the ancient glory of this country. English medals are published by Snelling, and in Vertue's account of Simon's works. On the Scotish coins the only books are those of Anderson and Snelling, neither of
<PB N="xxii" REF="21"/>them laudable. The Irish are well display∣ed by Simon, in his Historical Essay on Irish Coin, Dublin, 1749, 4to, with the Supplement.</P>
<P>With regard to other modern countries, the coins of France are best studied in Le Blanc's <HI>Traitè Historique des Monnoies de France,</HI> Paris, 1689, or Amsterdam same year, both editions in 4to. The ancient coins of Spain will be found to much ad∣vantage in the work of Florez, called <HI>Me∣dallas de las Colonias, Municipios y Pueblos antiguos de Espana, con las de los reyes Godos,</HI> 3 tom. 4to; the two first were pub∣lished in 1757, the last in 1773. On the more modern Spanish coins I know of no treatise to recommend. The papal medals were published at Rome in 1696, 2 vo∣lumes folio. The German coins, tho many authors have written in the German language about them, are not given in any good work, written in a language of more general intelligence. The Swedish coins
<PB N="xxiii" REF="22"/>are displayed in Brenner's <HI>Thesaurus Num∣morum Sueo-Gothorum,</HI> Holmiae, 1731, 4to. Bizot's <HI>Histoire Medallique de la Hollande</HI> gives the medals struck by the United Provinces, for few readers will have phlegm enough to read Van Loon's five folio vo∣lumes, of which a French translation was published at the Hague in 1732. On the coins of the several Eastern countries, and those of the smaller states in Europe, dif∣ferent treatises have been published, but, as they are little interesting, it were need∣less to enumerate them.</P>
<P>Such is the list of almost all the works, worth attention, which have been written on this science. Most of the others the reader will not peruse with impunity, as he will croud his memory with many errors, which it will require much study for him to eradicate. Pamphlets upon single medals, and the like, are commonly written by the authors only to shew that old women are not the only persons who can say a great deal upon nothing. These
<PB N="xxiv" REF="23"/>particularly swarm; and I will be bold to say that not one of them deserves perusal, even tho the name of a first-rate medallic author stands at the head of it.</P>
<P>This preface cannot be dismissed with∣out offering a remark upon the pedantry which, to this day, so prevails in this sci∣ence. They who make a pursuit of it, ought to reflect that, tho it is a most in∣nocent pursuit, and such as never engaged the attention of a bad man, it is yet a far more laudable amusement. They ought, in consequence, not to make of it an arti∣cle of faith, but to treat all the parts of it with coolness and candour, as matters of the merest indifference, and certainly of no necessity or importance. Instead of this, the conversation of some medallists is com∣monly vehement about trifles, and con∣demnatory of every opinion, of either liv∣ing or dead authors, which accords not with their own. Like other pedants, they are fierce and stern: for there are
<PB N="xxv" REF="24"/>many analogies between men and other animals, and none stronger than this, that they get fierce from being kept in the dark.</P>
<P>The French medallists treat the science with more politeness, tho they carry the attachment to a height unknown to us; as may be judged from the very late ex∣ample of M. Pellerin, a man of great wealth, who was so fond of medals as to continue to write upon the subject after he was blind with age. This he did by means of an invention described in the last volume of his works. The French fashion is now beginning to be followed among us; and many of the present medallists are no less distinguished by their knowledge than by their modest and liberal communication of it; so that it is to be hoped that, in a very short time, the pedantic spirit which has so long infested this science will totally disappear.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON MEDALS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> Rise and Progress of the Study of Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE amusement arising from medals is so common and universal, that we meet with few people who have not formed a little collec∣tion of some kind or other. As no axiom is looked upon as more certain than that even the minutest principles of the human mind have been the same in all ages, we must be induced to suppose that the study of medals is almost as ancient as medals themselves. We find not, however, in ancient writers, the slightest hint of collections of this kind. But many small par∣ticulars of the manners and customs of the an∣cients are passed without notice in their writers.
<PB N="2" REF="32"/>Indeed, in the days of Greece, a collection of such coins as then existed must have been re∣garded as no valuable acquisition, consisting only of those struck by the innumerable little States then using the Greek characters and lan∣guage. This would give them an air of do∣mestic coinage; and make them be regarded with an eye of little curiosity, however exqui∣site their impressions. Add to this the small in∣tercourse between different provinces and coun∣tries during that period, and we shall not won∣der that if a traveller or two collected a few hundred coins, yet none of their fellow-citizens thought such a minute anecdote worth commit∣ting to writing.</P>
<P>If we pass to the Romans, the only other people of antiquity in whose writings we can expect any information of this kind, we shall find that, almost as soon as any communication was opened between them and the Greeks, the future sovereigns of the world treated the Gre∣cian art, displayed in the minutest, as well as in the largest works of that ingenious nation, with due distinction and applause. The Grecian coins were imitated by the Roman workmen, and preserved in the cabinets of their senators, among the choicest treasures. The first cir∣cumstance we learn from the Roman medals of that period; and the latter from Suetonius, who tells us that Augustus used, on solemn occa∣sions,
<PB N="3" REF="33"/>to present his friends with medals of fo∣reign states and princes, along with other the most valuable testimonies of his love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Saturnalibus, et si quando alias libuisser, modo mun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ta divi∣debat, vestem, et aurum, et argentum; modo nummos omnis notae, et<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>am veteres regios ac peregrinos. Sueton. in Aug. n. 75.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a more advanced period of the Roman empire, we know that individuals must have formed serieses of Roman coins; for a complete series of silver was lately found in our island, containing all the emperors down to Carausius, inclusive<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Stukeley's Medallic History of Carausius; an author whom facts alone can justify my quoting.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From the decline of the Roman empire a total darkness envelopes every branch of sci∣ence, till the revival of literature in the end of the fifteenth century. Indeed, while the Chris∣tian dominion of Constantinople lasted, which was near twelve unhappy centuries, it may be pronounced to have stood the very palladium and sanctuary of ignorance and of barbarism. No fine art flourished in any kingdom during that gloomy period. But as soon as Constan∣tinople fell a prey to the Turks, that shrine of ignorance, with the goddess herself, became their portion; and science, as at the breaking of a talisman, stood confest all over Europe in an∣cient glory.</P>
<P>During a glimmering twilight which pre∣ceeded this radiant morning, literature was a
<PB N="4" REF="34"/>little cultivated in Italy. And so intimate and necessary a connection has now the study of medals with that of ancient erudition, that, on the very earliest appearance of a revival of the latter, the former was also disclosed.</P>
<P>For we find that Petrarca, one of the very first men in Europe who in modern times aspired to the celebrity of learning and of ge∣nius, was likewise the first to institute an ex∣ample of the science of medals. This eminent writer being desired by the Emperor Charles IV. to compose a book containing the lives of il∣lustrious men, and to place him in the list, with a noble pride answered, that he would comply with this desire whenever the emperor's future life and actions deserved it. Taking occasion from this, he sent that monarch a collection of gold and silver coins of celebrated men, as he tells us in his epistles. "Behold," says he to the emperor, <Q>to what men you have suc∣ceeded! “Behold whom you should imitate and admire! To whose very form and image you should compose your talents! The inva∣luable present I should have given to nobody but you: it was due to you alone. I can only know or describe the deeds of these great men. Your supreme office enables you ”to imitate them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecce, Caesar, quibus successisti. Ecce quos imita<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i studeas, et mirari: ad quorum formulam et imaginem to componas: quos, pretor to unum, nulli hominum daturus eram: tua me movit authoritas. Licet enim ho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um motes et nomina, horum ego res gestas norim; tuum est, non modum nosse, sed sequi. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hi itaque debebantur. Lib. x. epist. 3.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<PB N="5" REF="35"/>
<P>In the next age Alphonso king of Arragon caused all the ancient coins, that could be dis∣covered throughout the whole provinces of Italy, to be collected. The collection, however, must not have been very large, as it was placed in an ivory cabinet, and always carried with him. The author of his life informs us, that Alphonso confessed himself excited to great actions by the presence, as it were, of so many illustrious men in their images.</P>
<P>Anthony Cardinal of St. Mark, nephew of Eugene IV. who ascended the pontifical chair in 1431, had a vast collection. Soon after this, Cosmo de Medici began the grand museum of the family of the Medici at Florence; as the most ancient, so the most noble, in the universe. Among a profusion of other monuments of an∣cient art, coins and medals were not neglected. About the same period Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, formed a noble collection of coins, along with ancient manuscripts and other va∣luable reliques of antiquity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For some of these instances the author is indebted to the pre∣face of the last edition of La Science des Meda<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lles, Paris, 1739, 2 vols. 12mo.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Hitherto, however, no writer had ever thought of examining the subject of ancient
<PB N="6" REF="36"/>medals. I take the celebrated Agnolo Poli∣ziano, more known by the Latin appellation of Angelus Politianus, to be the very first who even adduced them as vouchers of ancient or∣thography and customs. In his Miscellanea<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cap. 19.58. &amp;c. Basil. 1522. 12mo.</NOTE>, written about 1490, he cites different coins of the Mediccan collection, then devolved to Lau∣rence de Medicis, duke of Florence, successor to the great Cosmo.</P>
<P>Maximilian I. emperor of Germany, having formed a cabinet of medals, Joannes Hutti∣chius was enabled, by its means, to publish a book of the lives of the emperors, enriched with their portraits, delineated from ancient coins. This book, which is thought to be the first<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Labbé, however, in his Bibliotheca Nummaria, mentions a work, called <HI>Illustrium Imagines,</HI> by one Andreas Fulvius, printed in 1<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>17, in which, as would appear, most of the portraits are from medals.</NOTE>of the kind, was printed in 1525, reprinted in 1534, and in 1537 a third edition appeared, with the addition of forty-two consular medals, engraved on wood. Prior to this, however, and about 1512, Guillaume Budé, a French writer, had written his treatise De Asse, though it was not printed till many years afterwards.</P>
<P>M. Grollier, treasurer of the armies of France in Italy during part of the sixteenth century, had a great collection of coins in all metals. De Thou tells us, in his History of his own
<PB N="7" REF="37"/>times, that, after the death of Grollier, his brass medals were carried from Paris into Pro∣vence, and were about to be sent to Italy, when the King of France, being informed of this transaction, gave orders that they should be stopped, and bought them at a high price for his own cabinet of antiquities. Besides the me∣dals of brass mentioned by De Thou, M. Grollier had an assortment of gold and silver. The cabinet containing them fell, two centu∣ries afterwards, into the hands of M. L'Abbé de Rothelin; and was known to have been that of Grollier from some slips of paper on which was his usual inscription for his books, "Jo∣annis Grollierii et amicorum."</P>
<P>Guillaume du Choul was the contemporary of Grollier, and likewise a man of distinction and fortune. He had a good collection of me∣dals, and published many in his treatise on the religion of the ancient Romans, printed at Ly∣ons in 1557.</P>
<P>The letters of Erasmus shew that the study of medals was begun, in the Low Countries, about the beginning of the sixteenth century. About the middle of that century, Hubertus Goltzius, a printer and engraver, travelled over a great part of Europe in search of coins and medals, for works, relating to them, which he intended to publish. In the prole∣gomena to his life of Julius Caesar, published
<PB N="8" REF="38"/>as a specimen of larger works in consequence of these researches, he addresses an epistle to all the antiquaries who assisted him, or whose ca∣binets he visited. This epistle contains a list of collectors, and their places of residence; by which it appears that, in the middle of the six∣teenth century, there were, in the Low Coun∣tries, 200 cabinets of medals; 175 in Germany; more than 380 in Italy; and about 200 in France. A prodigious number! but which now may be fairly quadrupled, I imagine, for these countries, with the addition of 500 for our own, which we must regret that Goltzius did not visit.</P>
<P>It is not, however, to be doubted that, while the other kingdoms of Europe were so rich in collections, this island neglected those treasures of antiquity, which the very soil afforded to every labourer. For in few countries in the world, if we except Italy, are more ancient coins found than in Britain; but at what period the study of them particularly commenced among the learned here, we are left in the dark. I suspect, however, that Camden was one of the first, if not the very first, of our writers, who produced medals in his works, and who must have had a small collection.</P>
<P>In the next, being the seventeenth, century, Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Earl Mar∣shal
<PB N="9" REF="39"/>of England, well known by the Arundelian Tables, and other monuments of antiquity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the cellar of a house in Norfolk Street in the Strand, is a fine antique bath, formerly belonging to this Earl of Arundel, whose house and vast gardens were adjacent. It is a pity that it is not more known, and taken care of.</NOTE>, which he imported into this island from Greece and Italy, had, in his exuberant collection of antiquities, a rich cabinet of medals, gathered by Daniel Nisum. The Dukes of Buckingham, and Hamilton; Sir William Paston, Sir Thomas Fanshaw, of Ware Park, Sir Thomas Hanmer, Ralph Sheldon, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Mr. Selden, and many more, are enumerated by Mr. Evelyn as having collections. The Earl of Clarendon, the histo∣rian, must not be omitted: far less the unhappy hero of his tale, Charles I. That imprudent monarch, with an utter hatred for liberty, the parent of the fine arts, was yet singularly at∣tached to these arts themselves; and, among other instances, had a very fine cabinet of me∣dals<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hear Junius, librarian to Charles the First, speaking of the palace at St. James's: <Q>Quem locum, si vic<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>am pinacothecam, “bibliothecae celeberrimae conjunctam; si <HI>numismata antiqua Graeca, ac Romana;</HI> si statuas, et signa, ex ae<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e et marmote, consideras, non immerito Thesaurum Antiquitatis, et <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> ”instructissimum, nominare potes.</Q> In Notis ad Clem.

<P>To trace the history of this study any further would swell this little treatise to a most unneces∣sary size. I shall content myself with observing that, from the middle of the last century, down to these times, almost every year has produced some new work, or new discovery, in this science.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> Utility of this Study.</HEAD>
<P>IF we cast an eye over the whole circle of the productions of human genius, perhaps we shall perceive none of such grand importance and utility to mankind as History. Most of the other efforts of the mind only interest indivi∣duals as such; but history, when executed with philosophic candour and propriety, concerns and instructs whole empires, indeed the whole universe. By it statesmen and states are taught, from the example of former and other nations, and that of their own in preceding times, to propagate measures that contribute to the gene∣ral welfare; and to guard against evils, which are often unforeseen, and, in consequence, not warded off, only because they are not known to
<PB N="12" REF="42"/>have existed in ancient periods, nor the me∣thods investigated which then prevented or mi∣tigated them.</P>
<P>But the very basis of history is truth, without which the causes of human action, nay the ac∣tions themselves, are disguised, and the instruc∣tion, arising from the narration, totally lost, or converted into an empty chimaera. Now the sole evidence we can have of the veracity of an historian consists in such collateral documents as are palpable to all, and can admit of no falsifi∣cation.</P>
<P>Such, in modern times, are public memoirs, instructions to ambassadors, letters of state, and the like vouchers; which every person allows to be irrefragable.</P>
<P>But as these proofs are subject to innumerable accidents, mutilation, and utter loss, their evi∣dence cannot be presumed to extend to very distant ages.</P>
<P>Add to this that, as such vouchers most com∣monly remain in the country whose actions they import, they cannot be satisfactory to the world at large without a degree of faith which, to the severe eye of philosophy, will appear too large.</P>
<P>Hence monuments of longer duration are re∣quired to evince the veracity of ancient history. Such indeed are public buildings, statues, and in∣scriptions. But the evidence of these testimonies, tho it extends to remote ages, does not extend to
<PB N="13" REF="43"/>remote countries, if we except a very few in∣stances of the two last articles.</P>
<P>The reader must have, ere now, recollected, from this deduction, that medals alone remain as the principal proofs of historic truth, their evidence reaching at once to the most remote ages, and the most remote countries.</P>
<P>The vast utility of this study is therefore clear, because it serves as a basis to the most important of all human sciences.</P>
<P>Perhaps the grounds of this reasoning may be looked upon as more abstract than existent; but a few examples will shew their justice and recti∣tude. I should indeed expect the sensible reader's derision, if these examples were such as are sometimes adduced on this score. Some writers tell us, that, without the science of an∣cient coins, we should never have known that Antoninus had a son by Faustina, called Marcus Annius Valerius Antoninus, had not a Greek coin fortunately preserved the memory of this most stupendous event; that we should never have known that a tyrant called Pacatianus existed, without such a circular record; nor that Barbia Orbiana was the wife of Alexander Severus. Astonishing discoveries! and equally fitted to delight and instruct!</P>

<PB N="14" REF="44"/>
<P>Leaving these impertinences of crude erudi∣tion, let us examine a little what has been ac∣tually performed towards an elucidation of dif∣ferent parts of ancient history, by means of the study of medals.</P>
<P>Vaillant, in his learned history of the kings of Syria, printed at Paris, 1681, set the first important example of fixing the dates, and ar∣ranging the order of events in ancient historians, by means of these infallible vouchers. By them alone he was enabled to fix, in a very great degree, the chronology and progress of events of three of the most important king∣doms of the ancient world, namely, those of Egypt, of Syria, and of Parthia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Many coins have been discovered of all these princes since Vaillant wrote, which further illustrate his provinces of history. His history of the Arsacidae of Parthia is his worst work; it is in∣deed a posthumous one; but he gives too much way to conjecture, as to the many princes on whose coins dates are wanting; which, in that series, are so numerous that, at this day, only ten princes have been found whose medals six their epoch.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Father Hardouin trod in the same path, but with a rashness which always attends ignorance, though indeed his Series of the Herodiades, or Kings of Judaea, successors of Herod, is the most unexceptionable of his works. Noris, in his learned treatise on the epochs of the Syro∣macedonian princes, and Bayer, in his history of Osrhoëne, followed the same plan, after∣wards
<PB N="15" REF="45"/>honoured by the names of Froelich<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Annales Regum et rerum Syriae. Vien. 1754.</NOTE>, Corsini<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De Minnilati, aliorumque Armentae Regum, Nummis, &amp;c. 1744</NOTE>, and Cary<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Histo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re des Rois de Thrace, et du Bosphore Cimmerian, eclaircie par les Medailles. Paris, 1752.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But the study of the Greek coins, tho it illustrates the chronology of reigns, yet never interprets that of events. This important addi∣tion is displayed, in all its vigour, in the Ro∣man medals; in which, most commonly, with the portrait of the prince, and date of his con∣sulship, or of his tribunician power, we have a representation, or poetical symbol, of some grand event on the reverse.</P>
<P>The Greek medals, struck in the imperial ages, often mark the year of the prince's reign; the Roman, most commonly, the number of the emperor's consulships, or of his tribunician power. As the latter aera is sometimes mis∣taken, by antiquaries, for a mark synonymous to the year of the emperor's reign, we shall beg leave to offer a few remarks on that subject, as perhaps a more proper occasion may not occur.</P>
<P>When Julius Caesar assumed the supreme power, he dared not to take the title of King, however ardently desirous of so ambitious a distinction. He was contented with that of
<PB N="16" REF="46"/>Perpetual Dictator, synonymous with the for∣mer in effect, and, had he been rightly advised of an import even more invidious. Certain i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, that it necessarily implied his intention never to quit, or even relax his authority; whereas he ought, under the disguise of some supreme magistrature of annual election, to have lulled the people with a dream that they might terminate his power when they pleased; or that he would himself resign it when the necessities of state, which required his tempo∣rary elevation, had subsided. His power would by this art have been perpetual, without great envy; whereas his open assumption of an empty title submitted him to all the malevolence which the utter despair of the people could supply. He paid for the mistake with his life.</P>
<P>Augustus, who, with far less ability than his uncle, had yet that cunning which, in the commerce of life, commonly avails more to its possessor than great talents, which are indeed always incompatible with it, had the prudence to follow the proper plan. Every person, the least skilled in Roman history, knows that there was an office, entrusted at first to two plebeians, called The Tribuneship of the People. This was of annual election; and in fact, in any other hands but those of plebeians, must have been the supreme power in the state, for it belonged
<PB N="17" REF="47"/>to that office to put an absolute negative upon every public measure whatever. Augustus, as of senatorial rank, could not assume the title of Tribune of the People, but he invested himself with one quite equivalent, Tribunicia Potestate, that of being endued with tribunician power. This had the advantages formerly pointed out as accruing to an appearance of temporary su∣premacy. Towards the end of his reign, he often assumed his destined successor, Tiberius, as a colleague in the office, for it had been for∣merly allotted to two, but at first he enjoyed it alone, and in all public instruments and records numbered his tribunician power as an annual office. This, with his other artifice of laying down his understood supreme power, and re∣suming it from ten years to ten years, at the de∣sire of the Senate, affianced his sovereignty to him in perfect security, to the natural end of his life.</P>
<P>This example was followed by his successors; so that the inscription on their coins is almost always TRIBUNICIA POTESTA<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>E, among other ti∣tles, with the date annexed to it, as TR. POT. VII. &amp;c. Yet, tho this date far most generally im∣plies the year of the emperor's reign, it however sometimes happens that the emperor was, by the special favour of a former prince, endued with this title before he came to the throne, as being the chosen successor to that prince. Of
<PB N="18" REF="48"/>this Tiberius, the fixed heir of Augustus, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Titus, the eldest son, and natural heir of Ve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pasian, are instances.</P>

<P>This little disquisition was necessary, whe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> treating of the utility of the Roman coins to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> chronology of history; but, leaving it, I shall proceed to observe, that a series of medals pre∣sents the very best suite of documents, of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Roman history in particular, that the art o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> man could have invented. Checking the flat<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣tery of some of them by the truth of history they in their turn reciprocally evidence th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> falsehood or veracity of the historian.</P>
<P>Were I inclined to display erudition upon th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subject of the various sources of utility arising<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the study of ancient medals, I should per∣haps
<PB N="19" REF="49"/>run the risk of rivalling Spanheim, who has written two stupendous folio volumes on this very theme. But as I much prefer a single spark of British sense to all the German erudi∣tion in the world, I shall content myself with offering a very few remarks further upon this division of my work, and even those after pre∣mising, that if any reader shall be inclined to pronounce, that the principal utility of this study is the elegant and scientific amusement which it affords, I shall not be disposed to quarrel with him upon the score of difference in our opinions.</P>
<P>However, besides its service to history, the science of medals is certainly of considerable use to geography; to natural history; to the il∣lustration of ancient writers; to architecture; and to the knowledge of a connoisseur, or that of ancient monuments, busts, statues, ceremonies, and the like.</P>
<P>Its utility to geography may be traced from the many Greek coins in which the situation of towns is assigned, as near some noted river, mountain, &amp;c. Thus we have MAENHTΩN ΣHIΥΛOΥ, of the inhabitants of Magnesia un∣der mount Sipylus: EΦEΣIΩN, and the figure of a river, with KAIΣTPOΣ in the exergue; which shews that Ephesus stood upon the river Cayster. Innumerable similar instances may be
<PB N="20" REF="50"/>given upon this head, but these may serve as a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> specimen.</P>
<P>The utility of the study of ancient medals to natural history arises chiefly from the coins struck on the celebration of the saecular games in which the figures of various animals are pre∣served. A celebrated naturalist would not have asserted that the camelopard had never been seen in Europe till this century, had he chanced on the saecular coin of Philippus, in which, if I mistake not, it appears. Indeed had he read Horace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> camelo." Epist. ad Aug.</NOTE>, you will say, he might have cor∣rected this blunder: and Politianus, in his Mis∣cellanea<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>, would have informed him of one sent in a present from the Sultan of Egypt to Lorenzo de Medici. These saecular medals very often indeed establish the point whether any animal was known to the ancients or not. On many of the Greek medals are the lively representations of many uncommon plants and animals; as in most of the medals of Cyrene is the celebrated plant called <HI>sylphium;</HI> and on those of Tyre the shell-fish from which the fa∣mous Tyrian purple was procured.</P>
<P>The brevity of my design obliges me to pass to the next division of utility, namely, that of the illustration of obscure passages in ancient writers to be drawn from coins. This article,
<PB N="21" REF="51"/>if treated at length, might be found almost in∣finite; for such parts of authors of antiquity as have been explained, or may be explained, by the help of old coins, and are explainable by that help only, are innumerable. Upon so vast a theme, therefore, I chuse rather to say no∣thing than to say little.</P>
<P>The uses to be drawn from this study to the art of the architect are undoubtedly many; for on medals are preserved the exact delineations of many of the most beautiful edifices of an∣tiquity, now not existing even in their ruins.</P>
<P>The knowlege of medals is no less useful, nay is absolutely necessary, to the connoisseur, because by it alone he is enabled to ascribe ancient busts and statues to their proper per∣sons; with innumerable other minute points of information, without which he cannot aspire to that name, and which are only to be attained from an attention to this branch of science.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> Connection of the Study of Medals with the Fine Arts of Poetry, Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture.</HEAD>
<P>THE connection of this science with poetry has already been treated, at a considerable length, by one of the most excellent writers England has produced. Mr. Addison, in his Essay on the Usefulness of ancient Medals, has compared them with passages of the Latin poets at some length. His title-page mentions that the Greek poets fall likewise into his plan; but this must be a mistake of the printer, or a yet stranger mistake of his own, for there is not the slightest quotation from any Greek writer whatever from beginning to end. The prefer∣ence
<PB N="23" REF="53"/>indeed which Mr. Addison seems always inclined to give to the Latin poets, over those of Greece<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Was Mr. Addison skilled in the Greek language<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he was, his sad taste in neglecting the Greek w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ters; if he was not, as I suspect, his ignorance, must evince him but very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣li<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ied for the office of a critic.</NOTE>, that is, to imitation over original genius, cannot be too severely reprobated. The opinion of that justly celebrated writer has a vast influence upon public taste; and it is no wonder, for the Spectator, of which the princi∣ples of criticism are, in many instances, very suspicious, is, nevertheless, deservedly the most popular book ever written.</P>
<P>I shall not, however, attempt here to supply that grand defect in Mr. Addison's performance, having the fear of Greek, and the ladies, before my eyes: not to mention that such an attempt would swell this slight essay to a size much be∣yond my intention. A few remarks, however, upon the general connection between the study of medals and poetry I shall beg leave to offer.</P>
<P>It may justly be observed, that the know∣ledge of Greek medals is most necessary for a sculptor, and perhaps an architect; while that of the Roman is the more interesting to a poet, and a painter. This is owing to the former containing chiefly the head of some king, some god, or goddess, of exquisite relief and work∣manship
<PB N="24" REF="54"/>on the obverse; while the reverse sel∣dom, in the early Greek coins, affords much fancy of symbol, and, in the Imperial Greek coins, is chiefly impressed with temples of their deities.</P>
<P>To a man of poetical imagination the Roman coins are most entertaining, from the fine perso∣nifications and symbols to be found on their re∣verses.—To instance in a few.</P>
<P>HOPE is represented as a sprightly girl, walk∣ing quickly, and looking strait forwards. With her left hand she holds up her garments, that they may not impede the rapidity of her pace; while, in her right hand, she holds forth the bud of a flower, an emblem infinitely more fine than the trite one of an anchor. This personification, with some others, must have been very familiar to the ancients, for often in this, and a few more instances, no name, as SPES AVG. or the like, is inserted in the legend.</P>
<P>ABUNDANCE is imaged as a sedate matron, with a cornucopia in her hands, of which she scatters the fruits over the ground, and does not hold up her cornucopia, and keep its contents to herself, as many modern poets and painters make her do.</P>
<P>The Emperor Titus, having cause to import a great supply of corn, during a scarcity at Rome, that supply, or the ANNONA, is finely re∣presented as a sedate lady, with a filled cornu∣copia
<PB N="25" REF="55"/>in her left hand, which she holds upright, to indicate that she does not, however, mean to scatter it, as Abundance hath a title to do, but to give it to Equity to deal out. This last par∣ticular is shewn by her holding a little image of Equity, known by her scales, and <HI>hasta pura,</HI> or pointless spear, in her right hand, over a basket filled with wheat. Behind the ANNONA is the prow of a ship, decked with flowers, to imply that the corn was brought by sea (from Africa), and that the ships had had a prosperous voyage. The best poet in the world could not have given us a finer train of imagery: the best painter would be puzzled to express so much matter in so small a compass.</P>
<P>SECURITY stands leaning on a pillar, indica∣tive of her being free from all designs and pur∣suits; and <HI>teres atque rotundus,</HI> round and po∣lished, as Horace phrases i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, against all the rubs of chance.</P>
<P>The emblems of PIETY, MODESTY, and the like, are equally apposite and poetical.</P>
<P>The happiness of the state is pictured by a ship, sailing before a prosperous breeze: an image than which the superlative genius of Gray could find none more exquisite; and he has accordingly used it in his most capital pro∣duction, The Bard, with due success.</P>
<P>The different countries of the then known world are also delineated with great poetical
<PB N="26" REF="56"/>imagery. It affords patriotic satisfaction i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particular to a Briton, to see his native island always represented, upon the earliest imperial coins, sitting on a globe, with the symbol o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> military power, the <HI>labarum,</HI> in her hand, and the ocean rolling under her feet. An emblem almost prophetic of the vast power which her dominion over the sea will always give her, providing she asserts her element of empire with due vigor and perseverance.</P>
<P>Speaking of the poetical imagery of ancient coins, it must not be forgotten that there is one, and, to add to the wonder, a colonial one, and of rude execution, of Julius and Augustus, inscribed IMP. &amp; DIVI F. which has a high claim to merit in this way. On the reverse the conquest of Egypt is represented by the appo∣site metaphor of a crocodile, an animal almost peculiar to that country, and at that period esteemed altogether so, which is chained to a palm-tree, at once a native of the country and symbolic of victory.</P>
<P>But, of the poetical invention displayed in very many of the ancient coins, these few in∣stances may suffice, considering, as has been said, that Mr. Addison has written so fully upon the subject of the connexion of this study with that of Latin poetry; and to enter upon that in other languages falls not into the brief plan of this little performance.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="57"/>
<P>I think we are told that Rubens had a very fine collection of medals, and indeed, to a painter who dealed so much in allegorical sub∣jects, they must have been of the very first im∣portance; for no where are the attributes of personification so finely preserved or delineated. A cabinet of medals may indeed be said to form the classic erudition of a painter.</P>
<P>It may be added, that, as the reverses are so useful for knowlege of personification, symbols of countries and actions, and the like, so the portraits to be seen on old coins are no less im∣portant to a painter; the high merit of a great number of them, in every character, justly entitling them to be regarded as the best studies in the world. Not to mention that to a painter of the highest rank, an historic painter, the sci∣ence of ancient medals is absolutely necessary, that he may delineate his personages with the features they really bore when in existence. This can only be attained in this way, or from statues and busts, any one of which will cost as much as hundreds of medals; and indeed a col∣lection of such is only attainable by princes.</P>
<P>This naturally leads me to consider a little the advantages arising from this study to sculp∣tors. Almost all the uses which connect the science of medals with painting likewise render it subservient to the art of the sculptor but the latter will, from the study of the Greek
<PB N="28" REF="58"/>coins in particular, derive no small profit. The heads of the several deities represented on them, in the most exquisite alto-relievo, will recommend them to his attention in a particular manner.</P>
<P>The wonderful skill of the Greeks in sculp∣ture has always been a subject of admiration to the world. Nations, in which a taste for the fine arts has made any progress, have viewed, with universal applause, the wonderful efforts of Grecian genius; the character and expression of the faces, the contour, and perfect nature and symmetry of the whole figure; the strength, chas∣tised with inimitable <HI>morbidezza,</HI> that, if not life itself, is almost superior.</P>
<P>Yet, I know not how it is, that the Grecian coins, sister productions of art, have never yet been regarded, so far as I know, with proper attention by men of taste. I can only account for this by supposing that the study of Greek medals has hitherto been looked upon as the province of the mere antiquary. But I will venture to say, that, to the man who admires medals solely as pieces of workmanship, those of Greece will afford the highest satisfaction. Considered in this view, and indeed in most others, they excel those of Rome, the best times of Rome, to a surprising degree. The perfect beauty and ten∣derness of the female portraits, and the strength and expression of the male, cannot be exceeded,
<PB N="29" REF="59"/>in any shape, by the largest efforts of Grecian sculpture.</P>
<P>In every quality of art the Roman coins yield to the Greek alone. If any aera were to be as∣signed to the Roman, as more eminent for work∣manship than another, that from Augustus to Adrian must have the preference. In the days of Adrian, in particular, the Roman mint seems to have been the very seat of art and genius; witness the vast number of exquisite personifica∣tions, engraved with equal workmanship, which swarm on the medals of that prince. Yet, from his time, down to the Posthumi, coins of admi∣rable execution are to be found. Those of the Faustinas and Lucilla deserve particular men∣tion. There is one, and not an uncommon one, of the latter in great brass, which yields to no∣thing of the kind. The reverse is a Venus, with the name around her. The portrait of the obverse seems to spring from the field of the coin. It looks, and breathes; nay, talks, if you trust your eyes.</P>

<P>The connection of the study of ancient coins with architecture consists in the views of many of the most excellent ancient edifices, which are found in perfect preservation on medals, and there only. These furnish much pleasure and
<PB N="30" REF="60"/>instruction to the architect, and serve to form his taste to the ancient manner; that manner which unites perfect simplicity with sublimity and grace; that manner which every age ad∣mires in proportion as it has genius to imitate.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> The various Sources of Delight and Amusement arising from it.</HEAD>
<P>THE principal and most legitimate source of pleasure arising from the science of medals is their workmanship. The motives of delight, which owe their origin to the other efforts of imitative art, will here likewise of course predo∣minate. A philosophic enquiry into the prime causes of our pleasures arising from art, tho it would make an admirable subject for a trea∣tise, yet were in this place foreign and im∣pertinent.</P>
<P>Not to enter then into that profound subject, this we know, that the most barbarous nations are more pleased with the rudest efforts of art than with the most admirable works of nature;
<PB N="32" REF="62"/>and that, in proportion as the powers of the mind are large and various, such, likewise, ar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pleasures which it receives from those su∣perlative productions of art, which can only b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the offspring of vast genius. It follows, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the creation of art alike pleases the most unin¦formed, and the most cultivated, mind.</P>
<P>In that creation the skill of the engraver o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> medals certainly deserves an honourable place<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> The offspring of his labour, to the portableness and high finishing of miniature painting, adds<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the relief and expression of sculpture.</P>
<P>The chief and most rational amusement, therefore, which springs from this study, origi∣nates from the strength and spirit, from the finish and beauty, which the engraver has dis∣played.</P>
<P>But, besides this, there are many other sources of entertainment in the science of medals. Such is the personal acquaintance which, so to speak, it gives us with all the great men of former times. Nothing can well be more amusing than to read history, with contemporary coins before you. It brings the actions, in a manner, before our eyes; and we sit, as in a theatre, with the actors before us.</P>
<P>Portraits have been always very interesting to mankind; and I doubt not but the love of them gave rise, not only to painting, but to sculpture.
<PB N="33" REF="63"/>No where are they to be found so ancient, so numerous, so well preserved, as in medals. For a knowlege which, tho unimportant, is yet, to our trifling natures, most interesting, namely, that of the form and features of those whose virtues and talents almost surpassed hu∣manity, we are indebted to this science only. Lawgivers, monarchs, warriors, authors, all pass, as in a fairy review, before us.</P>
<Q><L>"The medal, faithful to its charge of fame,</L>
<L>"Through climes and ages bears each form and name;</L>
<L>"In one short view, subjected to our eye,</L>
<L>"Gods, Emperors, Heroes, Sages, Beauties lie."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>We even mark, with delight, the surly features of a Perseus, or a Nero, and the lovely counte∣nance of a Faustina, tho their vices disgraced human nature.</P>
<P>To this satisfaction we may add that of be∣holding, in lively portraiture, the various dresses, manners, and customs, religious and civil cere∣monies; in short, <HI>the very form and pressure of the times</HI> of the ancients. Medals almost present an history of manners, an article but very lately cultivated, yet perhaps the most useful and in∣teresting of all the provinces of history.</P>
<P>For the ineffable delight which the sheer an∣tiquary takes in any rusty commodity, and de∣faced medals in particular, we shall not attempt
<PB N="34" REF="64"/>to account, but will leave it to any author who may, in future times, think of writing a much-wanted treatise on the diseases of the human mind. Certain it is, that men there are of this description, who look upon coins as the more ancient, and of course the more valuable, because the portrait, reverse, and legends, are almost totally obliterated, or at least so far as not to be recognizable by the most plodding as∣siduity, and forlorn conjecture. That exquisite device for a tattered banner,
<Q>"Quanto e piu lacera, tanto e piu bella,"</Q>
is their aphorism on the score of coins; where∣as, to the man of just taste, the perfect pre∣servation of a medal forms one of its principal qualities.</P>

<DIV2 N="5" TYPE="section">
<PB N="35" REF="65"/>
<HEAD><HI>SECTION V.</HI> Metals used in the fabrication of Coins and Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THESE metals are well known to be princi∣pally three; Gold, Silver, and the various modifications of Copper.</P>
<P>It is looked upon as an undeniable axiom in this science, that the more ancient the gold em∣ployed in coinage is, the greater is its purity. The standard of the utmost purity of gold <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s well known to be twenty-four carats. From these twenty four carats almost every nation in modern Europe has deducted nearly two, which are made up of alloy; so that the most usual purity of coined gold amounts to about twenty-two carats. The old English standard now used
<PB N="36" REF="66"/>is however twenty-three grains and a half fine and half a grain alloy.</P>
<P>Now the gold of the coinage of Philip o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Macedon, Alexander the Great, Demetrius, and other princes, and cities, within a few centurie<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of their respective ages, is of superior pu∣rity, and very little inferior to <HI>fine</HI> gold. In∣deed, the only reason which appears, in these early times, to have occasioned the use of alloy at all, seems to have been, that, without it en∣tirely, the gold would have been totally unmal∣leable and unworkable. For the fact is, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> little more alloy is allowed than was absolutely necessary for the purposes of fabrication.</P>
<P>The Roman gold coinage, down to Vespasian is very good, tho not so pure, for there is only a forty-eighth part of the <HI>fine</HI> gold alloy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> After that prince, indeed, the alloy is doubled, so that it rises to a twenty-fourth. Let us not rashly blame Titus, his successor, the best of princes, the delight of mankind, for the invidious office of debasing the public money. To those who have properly considered the subject, this de∣basement, far from appearing, as it would do in these times, an infamous effort of tyrannic power, will, on the contrary, shine forth in its proper colours, as an act which adds glory even to a Titus.—Let us explain this in few words.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="67"/>
<P>The taxes of the Roman empire were always returned to the Imperial treasury in gold, wit∣ness the common terms of civil law: <HI>Aurum Lustrale; Aurum Vicesimarium; Aurum Corona∣rium,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. On the contrary, the state expenditure was defrayed in silver. Hence, when, towards the decline of the empire, in∣finite debasements were permitted in the other metals, yet none was allowed in gold, being that in which the Emperor's income was paid, and of which any abatement in value came, of course, out of his own pocket. Thus the ad∣ditional alloy permitted by Titus was, in fact, an important alleviation of the taxes of his subjects.</P>
<P>Most of the gold coins of his father and pre∣decessor, Vespasian, have a purity quite surpriz∣ing, if the story told by Bodin be as true as it is improbable; for he tells us that the goldsmiths of Paris, upon melting a Vespasian of gold, found only a 788th part alloy. I suppose any of these goldsmiths would have informed him that gold of that purity was never used in any shape.</P>
<P>The silver of the ancient Greek medals is of corresponsive chastity, only admitting, as the gold, a very minute proportion of alloy; in like manner as the general run of modern coinage has likewise observed the same pro∣portion of alloy in the gold and the silver coin.</P>
<PB N="38" REF="68"/>
<P>But the Roman silver coinage, even in its greatest antiquity and purity, by no means equals the Greek; for the debasement of the silver was as great an advantage to the state as that of the gold would have been a loss. However, it can never be called base money till the reign of Didius Julianus, who, squan∣dering great wealth in his infamous purchase of the empire and subsequent donations to the praetorians, to induce them to maintain that purchase, found himself forced to have recourse to a vast degradation of the silver coinage. After this period, a pound of such silver is only worth a third part of the value of real silver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patin, introduct. a l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Hist. des Medailles.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Proceeding to the brass employed in mintage by the ancients; when pure, which is very un∣common, it consists of two kinds; the red, or what the ancients called Cyprian brass, what we call copper; and the yellow.</P>
<P>The first of these is very uncommon in the largest size of brass medals, or what are called large brass; but is common in the other sizes.</P>
<P>Having spoken of these three pure metals, let us proceed to mention the mixed. With us every coin of mixed metal is looked upon, without hesitation, as the produce of a forger's craft; but with the ancients it was otherwise; their coins in mixed metals being nearly as numerous as any others.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="69"/>
<P>Taking these mixtures according to their dignity, the first which occurs is <HI>electrum,</HI> being a mixture of equal parts of gold and silver. The coins of the kings of the Cimmerian Bos∣phorus, during the imperial ages of Rome, are struck in this metal, and are very scarce.</P>
<P>The next in value were Corinthian brass, had the ancients even struck a single medal in that metal, which, unfortunately for many a fond antiquary, they did not. That celebrated me∣tal, during the very little time it was ever known at all, was certainly only employed in the fabrication of vases and other ornamental toys. Indeed its aera of being in use was, as any rate, very short; for Pliny the elder tells us, that for a long time it had been utterly unknown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Adeoque exolevit fundendi <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is pretiosi ratio, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ne fortuna quidem in aere jus a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s habeat. Hist. Nat. XXXIV. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. With reason, therefore, we may laugh at those deluded authors, who pretend not only to find this metal in Imperial coins, but even to find three kinds of it; namely, 1. That in which gold predominates; 2. That in which silver is most eminent; 3. That in which brass is the most plenteous metal. I suspect Enea Vico, one of the earliest writers on me∣dals, to have been the author of this strange idea; which Savot, a writer of the beginning of the seventeenth century, had sense enough
<PB N="40" REF="70"/>to confute. The mistake must have arisen from the circumstance of the first propagator of it not being able to account for the various mix∣tures and modifications of brass, observable in ancient coins of the large size; and which, especially in so common a metal, appear so odd to modern eyes. But, not to mention the authority of Pliny, above quoted, which is per∣fect proof; or that of later antiquaries, who all declare that they have never seen one coin of Corinthian brass, or brass mingled with the slightest proportion of gold or silver; there is another evidence of such simple structure, and yet such vast weight, that nothing can well mark the absence of the antiquaries more than its omission, namely, that it is in the imperial <HI>ases,</HI> worth about a penny, that this precious metal is discovered, for I remember not to have heard of medallions in it. As the great size and weight of these <HI>ases</HI> are well known, and they passed in common currency for about a penny only, it were truly surprising could the ancients have afforded any gold or silver in their fabric; nay, a predominance of either metal over the brass!</P>
<P>The fact is, that those coins, which some an∣tiquaries denominate of Corinthian brass, are only struck on a mixture of the red and yellow brass mentioned above.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="71"/>
<P>To place the succeeding sorts of mixtures according to their actual value, were an attempt as superfluous as difficult. They shall there∣fore be detailed as they rise to memory.</P>
<P>Many of the Roman coins are of what the French call <HI>potin,</HI> which is described as a mix∣ture of copper, lead, and tin, with a fifth part silver. The Abbé Rothelin, a noted collector of this century, had a complete suite of this metal. The suite must of consequence have been the work of the Egyptians, who used that metal, or of Roman forgers, thro the several reigns, in imitation of the silver currency. As must likewise that sort called by the Italians <HI>metalline,</HI> which are common in the third and fourth ages of Roman emperors, and are only of copper tinged or washed with silver. Many coins of what is called large brass are of those mixtures now called pot metal and bell-metal. There are medals of Nero of a most debased and brittle brass. After the days of Gallienus coinage of brass with a very minute addition of silver, may, I suspect, be in many instances regarded as that authorised by the state. As may those of copper or iron plated with silver, which always, however, console the collector, for their diminution of intrinsic value, by their indubitable antiquity.</P>

<P>A few particulars relating to ancient coins which deserve notice, and yet which do not so properly fall under any of the other sections of this work, nor are proposed to be treated at such length as to constitute sections of them∣selves, I shall beg leave to state here.</P>
<P>The ROMAN MINT, as the most important of these articles, deserves to be first mentioned. Of the Greek Mints we know little or nothing, but the excellence of the engravers employed, the most important object indeed to the lover of medals. But the Roman Mint we know was justly regarded as one of the most essential ornaments and sinews of the state. It's impor∣tance was vast, from the vastness of that empire thro which its produce was to circulate.</P>
<P>Not to enter at length into the subject, which indeed cannot be expected here, a few notices
<PB N="43" REF="73"/>only shall be given which are most necessary to the science of medals.</P>
<P>The <HI>Questor</HI> seems at first to have had the di∣rection of the Mint, as well as the Treasury. About the time of the first coinage of silver in Rome, or 266 years before Christ, the <HI>Triumviri Monetales</HI> seem to have been created<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pomponius ascribes their first creation to the year of Rome <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>63, or 289 before Christ. <HI>Ad legem</HI> 2. § <HI>de origine juris.</HI> On <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Augustus and Tiberius their names are common with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> VIR.

They were at first of the senatorial rank, till Augustus appointed them from the equestrian; and the alteration seems to have continued. However this be, the title <HI>Triumviri</HI> remained till after Ca∣racalla, as appears from inscriptions given us by Gruter, and by Bouteroue. But under Aurelian it is probable there was but one master of the Roman mint, called the <HI>Rationalis</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vop<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scus, in Aureliano.</NOTE>: and I sus∣pect this change took place under Gallienus. Aurelian having conquered the revolted pro∣vinces, and united the whole empire again, seems to have altered the form of the mints in the capital provincial cities, and to have ordered them all to strike money with Latin legends, and of the same forms; for with him first ap∣pear coins on this plan with mint-marks of ci∣ties and offices. He seems also to have per∣mitted the provincial cities to strike gold and silver, as at Rome. And we know from his

<P>This office was of the highest dignity and emolument, and had under it a vast number of inferior offices.

He says that this number will puzzle us even supposing an error of a cypher; but errors of cyphers do not occur in old MSS, where n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cyphers are found. The number will be th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more surprising if, with some antiquaries, w<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> suppose slaves never employed in any office about the Roman Mint; for indeed the Roman laws most inhumanly prohibited slaves from be∣ing employed in any ingenious or liberal art. Yet I see not that this forbad their being em∣ployed in any office about the Mint, save that of engraving the dies; so I doubt not but that a number of the 40,000 were slaves. Indeed, supposing slaves not employed about the Mint, yet we may well conjecture that the Triumvirs of the Mint armed their own slaves upon such an occasion; and we all know that 5000 slaves were in the possession of many not the most opulent Romans.</P>
<P>In the Roman colonies the direction of the Mint appears to have been with the Duumviri, or two annual magistrates, elected in imitation of the consuls at Rome. Their names are often upon colonial coin, which is indeed of little</P>

</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<PB N="45" REF="79"/>value, but to the man of antiquity, being gene∣rally of rude invention, and always of rude execution.</P>
<P>The ancient manner of coining was very sim∣ple, as we may judge from the coins them∣selves, and from the instruments, as they are represented on the reverses of some ancient me∣dals, particularly one with this legend T. CARI∣SIVS. The engraving of the dye was indeed a work of much labour and genius; and, what is very surprising, hardly any two coins were struck off without an alteration on the dye, of some minute kind or other. Hence very many antiquaries have been induced to that wild opi∣nion, that there was never, in the good ages of the Roman empire, above one coin struck from one dye. Indeed M. de la Bastie, a most able judge of these matters, informs us, that the only two Roman imperial coins, of the first ages, which he had seen, that were perfectly alike, were two of Galba; and many compe∣tent judges of this science caution us, when we meet with two coins quite alike, to be upon our guard against the falsity of one of them. But it must be observed, that the differences in coins apparently from the same dye, are often very minute, so as sometimes to escape an eye not used to microscopic observation of this sort.</P>
<P>The process of the Roman coinage seems to have been, 1. The melting the metal, and
<PB N="46" REF="80"/>making it of the proper alloy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed in the mint-master's titles by <HI>Flando.</HI></NOTE>, then hammer∣ing it to the proper thickness. 2. The cutting it into pieces of due weight; as, in cutting, the pieces, when round, often exceeded weight, we seldom see medals quite circular, frag∣ments being clipped off the sides of them, to reduce them to the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weight. 3. The impressing the dye, which was done by repeated strokes of the hammer<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>It is looked upon as a certain rule in this sci∣ence, that none of the ancient money was cast in molds, except the Egyptian, and a few of the Greek colonial coins, with some of Post∣humus, in great and middle brass. All other cast coins are forgeries of ancient or of modern times: for this was a manoeuvre of the ancient forgers, as we learn from several Roman molds<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">A <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> one may be seen in the <HI>Nummi P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrokiani.</HI></NOTE>which have been found, and which have led the unskilful to imagine that the ancients first cast their money, and then stamped it, to make the impression more deep and sharp; an idea so ut∣terly absurd as to need no confutation.</P>
<P>The ancients, though strangers to the art of impressing legends upon the edges of their money, like the DECUS ET TUTAMEN upon our crown pieces, and to the fine indentation observ∣able on our gold, yet knew something of cre∣nating
<PB N="47" REF="81"/>the edges of their coin. This they did by cutting out regular notches on the edges, in the shape of small parts of a circle. Some of the Syrian coins, and of the Roman consular, with a few other early ones, are ornamented in this manner.</P>
<P>It may not be improper to add to this section some hints as to the number of ancient coins, with quite different reverses, which we have. The Abbé Rothelin had in his cabinet no less than 1800 coins of Probus, whose reign was but of seven years. The number of Roman gold imperial coins may amount to 3000; the silver to 6000; and the brass to 30,000. The whole of the different ancient coins, known to us, to about 50,000.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VI.</HI> Different Sizes of ancient Coins.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greek coins, in gold and silver, are di∣vided into the several denominations of the <HI>Drachm,</HI> which is nearly equal in value to the Roman <HI>denarius,</HI> and commonly a little large<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> than our sixpence; the <HI>Didrachm,</HI> or double the former; the <HI>Tridrachm,</HI> or it's triple; and the <HI>Tetradrachm,</HI> equal in value, as the name im∣ports, to four <HI>drachms.</HI></P>
<P>All these Greek pieces, tho of fixed weight, are of very uncertain sizes; the Tetradrachm, for instance, being sometimes expanded to the size of our crown-piece, and often no larger than our shilling, tho what it wants in extent
<PB N="49" REF="83"/>it compensates in thickness, so as to preserve nearly the same weight. Hence medallists have been forced, in arranging the Greek medals, to do it by their weight, while they place the Ro∣man according to size.</P>
<P>Indeed, the ancient Greek gold and silver coinage was always allotted by the weight of different parts of their ounce, the drachm being in Greece, as at this day, the term of a weight equal to the eighth part of an ounce, and that, I suppose, before the invention of money<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Homer mentions scales, but knew nothing of money.</NOTE>: for it is natural to imagine that, upon the invention of coinage, the first rude attempts bore no sort of impression whatever<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">They who wish to see this subject enveloped in the darkness of German erudition may consult the book of Sperlingius, <HI>De Nummis non Cusis.</HI></NOTE>, but were solely valued by their weight. As different States, however, found it convenient to pursue different modes of coinage, some rude mark, as a badge of distinc∣tion, was at first impressed upon one side of the coin. This is very evident in the progress of the Grecian coinage in particular. It is true, that, to this day, no pieces have been found to∣tally unimpressed, or, if they have, no notice has been taken of them; but we have coins which, from their form and feature, are allowed to be the oldest in the world, and which are struck upon one side with the uncouth figure of a tor∣toise,
<PB N="50" REF="84"/>while the other has only indented mark<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> occasioned by its being fixed upon some instru∣ment in order to receive the impression. Coi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the same marks in every respect, and evi∣dently of the same State, but in a more ad∣vanced mintage, have All<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l upon them. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> antiquaries interpret <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Aegium in Achaia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a place almost unknown to any geographer, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mentioned by Homer very slightly, as of n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> account.

<P>To return. As weight was doubtless th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first estimate of coin, so, in the Grecian in par∣ticular, it continued always the standard: th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is surprizing that this ingenious people di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not perceive that by fixing the size, as well as the weight of money, much unnecessary trou∣ble might have been saved in commerce. In∣deed,
<PB N="51" REF="85"/>the weight itself varied in different states, and in the same state at different periods: but to detail erudition upon this point were as ab∣surd as unnecessary; it is sufficient to have laid down the general rules for distinguishing the different Greek coins. It may not however be improper to add, that small Grecian silver coins are likewise found of the value of the half and quarter, nay the eighth and sixteenth, of a drachm; and that the Greek <HI>stateres,</HI> often mentioned in their writers, were sometimes di∣drachms, and sometimes tetradrachms, of gold.</P>
<P>The Grecian brass coins are, the Lepton, which is the smallest, the Chalcos, the Dichal∣cos, Hemiobolium, and Obolus, which is larger than the Roman large brass; and when it occurs, or the Double Obolus, they are com∣monly called <HI>weights</HI> by antiquaries, who, under that name, often disguise their ignorance of the size of some ancient coins.</P>
<P>The sizes of the Roman coins are much more fixed and appropriated. In gold we have the golden denarius, by the ancients termed simply <HI>aureus,</HI> which is always much of a size with the denarius. In silver likewise the largest we have is the <HI>denarius.</HI> Any Roman coins in gold or silver of superior size are medallions. Lesser silver coins, however, are the <HI>quinarius,</HI> or half the denarius, and the <HI>sestertius,</HI> or its fourth. There are likewise a few <HI>quinarii</HI> of gold.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="86"/>
<P>The Roman copper coinage, it is well known, falls chiefly into three sizes; the <HI>as,</HI> or large brass; the <HI>semis,</HI> or middle brass; and the <HI>quadrans,</HI> or small brass. We have no coins between the first and second sizes, which are equal to those of our crown and half crown; but after the second size there is great variety, being the <HI>quincunx, triens, quadrans,</HI> and <HI>sex∣tans,</HI> of the ancients; all which however me∣dallists denominate, without distinction, coins in small brass.</P>
<P>After the time of Gallienus the large brass is very uncommon, except in the medals of Postumus; but after Postumus the large brass is deemed a medallion, and the middle brass is regarded as of a rank with the large of the earlier emperors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION VII.</HI> Their former Value.</HEAD>
<P>IN estimating the former value of ancient coins a curious distinction occurs between them and the modern. In the proportion of the copper to the silver, both are much alike; but in that of the silver to the gold there is a very wide difference. Our guinea, equal in size to our shilling, contains twenty one shillings; whereas the Greek gold drachm, and Roman <HI>aureus,</HI> equal in size to the silver drachm, and denarius, were only valued at ten drachms, or denarii, of silver. The modern discoveries of America, and other countries opulent in mines, can have no effect upon this change in the pro∣portional value of gold and silver, as much being found of the former as of the latter
<PB N="54" REF="90"/>The causes why gold encreases in its value and preeminence over other metals, almost every century, I must confess to be latent to me, and I have in vain tried to investigate them.</P>
<P>It is in the copper and silver coinage of the ancients that we must find our standard of the relative value of their money to ours. The gold is out of all proportion, owing to the na∣tions of antiquity valuing that metal at only one half the price which we put upon it. So that if we are told in an ancient writer that a house, for example, was bought for 4000 drach<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of gold, instead of appretiating the house at 80,000 drachms of silver, the modern proportion, we should mark it's value at 40,000, the ancient relation of gold to silver; that is, instead of 2666<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 13<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> we should put 1333<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; if we would have the real purchase in English money.</P>
<P>It is by no means intended here to lay before the reader any account of the ideal money of the ancients. All that is proposed is to inform him of the relative value of the real ancient coins which commonly occur, and are mention∣ed in the preceding section. This shall be done in the order they are there enumerated.</P>
<P>The Greek silver drachm is worth eight pence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some drachms occur worth 7 ½<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; others of 8 ½<ABBR><HI>d;</HI></ABBR> the mean is chosen.</NOTE> of our money: the gold drachm, being
<PB N="55" REF="93"/>worth ten of the silver, must, according to the ancient estimate, be worth 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; but, by the modern calculation of gold and silver, 13<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> The other Greek coins in gold and silver may easily be appretiated of course.</P>
<P>Of the Grecian brass six oboli went to a drachm<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pollux.</NOTE>; the <HI>obolus</HI> was therefore current for 1 ¼<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> and 2/6, or about five farthings of our mo∣ney. The lepton is nearly half a farthing; the chalcos nearly a farthing; the dichalcos rather more than a farthing; the hemiobolus rather more than a halfpenny.</P>
<P>In the Roman coinage the <HI>aureus</HI> was, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t one time, worth, as the Grecian gold drachm, only ten of the silver denarii. Pliny however in∣forms us, that it was afterwards raised to the value of sixteen silver denarii, at which rate it is supposed to have stood ever after; so that we must put t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ureus</HI> at 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> ancient va∣luation, 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> modern.</P>
<P>The <HI>denarius</HI> is by all writers, ancient and modern, rated at the same value with the Greek drachm, tho the latter sometimes exceeds it in weight by five grains. The <HI>quinarius</HI> passed for half, or 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> The <HI>sestertius</HI> for the quarter, 2<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> It may not be improper to observe a peculiarity in the Roman writers with regard to the last of these, the <HI>sestertius,</HI> likewise
<PB N="56" REF="94"/>by them called <HI>nummus</HI> indefinitely, which is, that in the neuter plural it multiplies one thou∣sand fold, as <HI>decom sestertia</HI> are equal to 10,000 sestertii; and in the neuter singular it multiplies two thousand sold, as <HI>decies sestertium</HI> stands for 20,000 sestertii. <HI>Mille sestertium</HI> equals in our money 8<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 5 ½<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; but <HI>mille sestertia</HI> 8072<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 18<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d</HI></ABBR><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arbuthnot on ancient coins, weights, and measures.

<P>The largest of the Roman copper coins was at first the <HI>dupondius</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The only <HI>dupondius,</HI> I suppose, ever found, is in the Earl of Pembroke's cabinet.

This being found most inconvenient from it's vast weight, the <HI>as,</HI> or <HI>aes,</HI> signifying a piece of brass, was coined, and weighed, in the earliest times, a pound, whence it was called <HI>libella.</HI> However, the Romans, finding their money exhausted by the Punic wars and other calamities, reduced the <HI>as</HI> by degrees from a pound weight to an ounce<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Many writers say half an ounce.

<PB N="57" REF="95"/>farthings of our money; and it is at present nearly worth that for the metal, if it is good.

<P>The different divisions of the <HI>as</HI> may, if it is worth while, be easily estimated from the value of the whole.

<P>Nothing contributes so much to the conser∣vation of coins as that fine rust, or rather var∣nish, which their lying in a particular soil oc∣casions. This is only to be found however in the brass or copper, the gold and silver never admitting of it: there is indeed a red rust which is sometimes found on the latter, but it is pre∣judicial, and not ornamental; and corrodes the coin, instead of preserving it.</P>
<P>This fine rust, which is indeed a natural varnish not imitable by any effort of human art, is sometimes of a delicate blue, like that of a turquoise; sometimes of a bronze brown, equal to that observable in ancient statues of bronze, and so highly prized; and sometimes of an exquisite green, a little on the azure hue, which last is the most beautiful of all. In a few instances a rust of deeper green is found; and it is sometimes spotted with the red or bronze shade, which gives it quite the appear∣ance of the East Indian stone called blood-stone. These rusts are all, when the real product of time, as hard as the metal itself, and pre∣serve it much better than any artificial varnish could have done; concealing at the same time
<PB N="60" REF="100"/>not the most minute particle of the impressio<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the coin.</P>
<P>When medals are found in which the letter are displaced, as is common in those of Clau∣dius Gothicus, their condition is looked upon as dubious, and they are not near so much esteemed as coins without fault. The same may be said of those which, not being well fixed in the dye, have slipped at every stroke of the hammer, and by this means present a double o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> triple image. Many of these last are found in which the portrait is thus blundered, while the reverse is distinct; and others, of which the portrait is perfectly well struck, while the re∣verse confuses the eye by it's double or triple contours. This must have been owing to that particular half of the dye being mismanaged in which the fault is found.</P>
<P>There is another blemish of ancient coins, which, notwithstanding, rather recommends them to the curious than otherwise. It is when, after having struck a coin, the workmen thro forgetfulness put another into the dye without retiring the first. Hence, the portrait of the other piece being commonly upwards, and in the upper part of the dye, the second coin is impressed with it by the dye, and at the same time made hollow on the other side with the form of the portrait already stamped on the former medal.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="101"/>
<P>Coins of genuine antiquity are often found split on the edges, or even in the middle, by the force of the hammer. But this, far from being regarded as a fault, is looked upon as a great merit by the collector, it being considered as a proof that the coin is undoubtedly of an∣cient fabric<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am afraid one of these split coins has given rise to an error with regard to the wife of an emperor who reigned in Britain with much magnificence.

<P>THESE portraits ought to be taken in chro∣nological order, and, in this view, the Kings of Macedon will have the first rank, as their coins have the greatest antiquity of any yet discovered on which portraits are found<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Of these, Amyntas, who began his reign about 550 years before Christ, is the earliest mo∣narch whose medals have yet been discovered; and of course he begins the series.</P>
<P>Then follow those kings and queens who reigned in Sicily, Caria, Cyprus, Heraclia, and Pontus. To these succeeds the series of kings of Aegypt, Syria, the Cimmerian Bosphorus,
<PB N="63" REF="103"/>Thrace, Bithynia, Parthia, Armenia, Damascus, Cappadocia, Paphlagonia, Pergamus, Galatia, Cilicia, Sparta, Paeonia, Epirus, Illyricum, Gaul, and the Alps. This series extends from the time of Alexander the Great to the birth of Christ, a period of about 330 years. The last series of ancient kings goes down to the fourth century, and includes some of Thrace, the Bos∣phorus, and Parthia; those of Commagene, Edessa or Osrhoene, Mauretania, and Judaea.</P>
<P>Such are the serieses of the portraits of kings to be found on medals struck with Grecian characters. Of Greek coins, impressed with the heads of illustrious men, a good number may be found, but ought more properly to be called a collection than a series, the latter term always implying a chronological succession.</P>
<P>The Roman emperors present a most distinct series, from Julius, the first of them, to the destruction of Rome by the Goths: nay, to a much later period, were not the coins after this so barbarous as to destroy the beauty of the series while they add to its perfection.</P>

<P>AS that side of the coin on which any por∣trait is delineated is commonly termed the <HI>face,</HI> or <HI>obverse,</HI> so the opposite side is termed the <HI>reverse.</HI></P>
<P>These reverses, in the ancient Greek and Roman coins, are of infinite variety, and afford one of the chief amusements arising from this study. They contain figures of deities, at whole length, with their attributes and sym∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ols; public buildings, and diversions; allego∣rical representations; ceremonies, civil and re∣ligious; historical and private events; figures of ancient statues; plants, animals, and other subjects of natural history; ancient magistracies,
<PB N="66" REF="106"/>with their insignia; in short, almost every objec<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of nature or art.</P>
<P>Some reverses bear the portrait of the queen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the son, or the daughter, of the prince wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appears on the obverse. Such are esteemed highly by antiquaries, not only because it is a rule with them that every coin stamped with portraits on either side is very valuable, but because they identify the personage on the re∣verse to have been the wife, the son, or the daughter, of such a particular prince, and by this means help in the adjusting of a series.</P>
<P>The reverses of the Roman coins have more of art and design than the Greek; but, in re∣turn, the Greek have more exquisite relief and workmanship than the other.</P>
<P>In the very ancient coins, as in those of the first kings of Macedon, no reverse is found, save a rude mark struck into the metal, as of a square with a cross in it, or the like. This was owing to the medal being merely fixed firm to some instrument on that side, that it might receive the impression upon the other. By degrees however we see some little image of a horse, or other animal, inserted into one of the departments of the rude cross, or into the body of the square. Then follows a perfect reverse of an horse, or the like, with a slight mark, and at length without any mark of the square or
<PB N="67" REF="107"/>cross. Such is the progress of the reverses of coins from rudeness to design, which was soon after carried to refinement.</P>
<P>The figures of deities and personifications, on the Roman coins, are commonly attended with their names, besides being distinguished by their attributes. These names, when without any adjunct, as they sometimes stand, may be safely looked upon as put down merely because it was necessary the coin should have a legend. Thus, in a coin of Lucilla, Venus, tho well known by the apple which she always holds in her hand, has yet the name round her, VENVS, without any addition whatever. The like may be ob∣served in a few other instances. But most com∣monly an adjunct is added, which renders the insertion of the name very proper and neces∣sary, as in the instance of a Neptune, with NEPTVNO REDVCI; a Venus, with VENERI VICTRICI; and others similar. The like may be said of the coins with a figure of Modesty, PVDICITIAE AVGVSTAE; of Virtue, VIRTVS AV∣GVSTI; and others of the same kind: for it is the legend which appropriates the virtue to the emperor or empress, and thus leaves no doubt as to the meaning of the reverse. A quality not so often observed on modern medals, which are frequently dark as a riddle; and it seems to be the intention of the designer to make the
<PB N="68" REF="108"/>legend and reverse fight a combat together and obscure, not illustrate, each other's meaning</P>
<P>In the Greek coins, however, perhaps it is a superior delicacy that the name of the deity i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> never expressed, but left to the easy interpre∣tation of fixed symbols. This remarkable dif∣ference is observable in the earliest coins of the two countries, and on which only the bust o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the deity or personification is given. The Ro∣man have almost always the name, as PIE∣TAS, LIBERTAS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> while the Greeks conten<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves with giving us Ceres with he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wheaten garland; Jupiter with his mild coun∣tenance, laurel crown, and beard; Minerva with her helmet, and so forth. This practice of the Greeks makes it necessary to present my reader, in the next section, with some account of the symbols most observable on their coins<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When I speak of <HI>the Greek coins,</HI> absolutely, thro-out this work, those preceding the imperial ages of Rome are meant: yet the present list of symbols applies in a great degree to the Greek imperial coins.</NOTE>, that when he meets with them he may easily know the deity they distinguish.

When the bust only occurs, he has a fair young face, and is crowned with laurel; and, in the character of the sun, his head is surrounded with rays.</P>
<P N="4">IV. MARS, seldom seen on Greek medals, is distinguishable by his armour, and sometimes by a trophy on his shoulders. The bust is known by the helmet and ferocious counte∣nance.</P>
<P N="5">V. MERCURY appears with the <HI>caduceus,</HI> or wand twined with serpents, and the <HI>marsupium,</HI> or purse, which he holds in his hand. He is delineated as a youth with a small cap on his head, and wings behind his ears and at his feet. The bust is known by the cap, which resem∣bles a small hat, and the wings.</P>
<PB N="72" REF="112"/>
<P N="6">VI. AESCULAPIUS is remarkable by his bush<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beard, and his leaning on a club with a serpen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twisted round it. He sometimes occurs with his wife Hygeia, or Health, and their little so<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Telesphorus, or Convalescence, between them.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The attributes of BACCHUS are, the ti∣ger, the satyrs around him, the <HI>thyrsus</HI> or ro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> twisted with ivy or vine, and the crown com¦posed of one of these plants. His bust is dis∣tinguishable by the latter symbol.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The club, lion's skin, and sinewy strength, reveal HERCULES: sometimes a cup is added, to imply that wine inspires courage; and the poplar tree, symbolic of vigor. He often appears as breaking the neck of the Ne∣maean lion by crushing it stoutly in his arms. His bust is common on coins of Alexander the Great, and other princes; as also on those of some Sicilian cities, as Messina, and others: it is that of a youth without a beard, with the lion's skin wrapt around it; and on the coins of Alexander has been falsely taken for the por∣trait of that prince. He likewise is sometimes drawn with a beard, in which case he is called the Old Hercules; as, when he appears beard∣less, he is denominated the Young Hercules.</P>
<P N="9">IX. SERAPIS, one of the fantastic gods of Egypt, is known by his bushy beard, and the measure upon his head. APIS appears as a bull with a flower of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the <HI>celtis,</HI> or <HI>lotus,
<PB N="73" REF="113"/>fructu nigricante,</HI> of botanists, between his horns. This tree, by us called the nettle-tree, from the form of its leaf, seems to have been a great fa∣vourite of the ancients, and placed in the same rank with the laurel and the myrtle, the fa∣vourites of Apollo and Venus. Its flower is in the form of a rose, of five leaves, and with many stamina in the bosom; and its fragrance induced the ancients to sprinkle it over their couches, along with the blooms of the myrtle.</P>

<P N="10">X. HARPOCRATES, the god of silence, is evident from the familiar token of putting his finger to his mouth. Sometimes he has the sistrum in his left hand, which is a symbol common to most of the Egyptian deities.</P>
<P N="11">XI. CANOPUS is very common on the coins of Egypt, in the singular shape of a human head, placed upon a kind of pitcher. This deified pitcher seems to refer to an anecdote of ancient superstition, which, I believe, is recorded by Plutarch. It seems, some Persian and Egyptian priests had a contest which of their deities had the superiority. The Egyptian said that a sin∣gle vase, sacred to Serapis, would extinguish the whole power of the Persian deity of fire.
<PB N="74" REF="114"/>The experiment was tried, and the wily Egyp∣tian boring holes in the side of the vase, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stopping them with wax, afterwards filled th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vessel with water, which, gushing through th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> holes, as the wax melted, extinguished th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Persian deity. Hence the vase was deified, and certainly deserved it better than the onions and leeks of that learned and foolish nation, so wel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ridiculed by Juvenal:

<P N="12">XII. This list of symbolized gods shall be closed with the IEPA ΣΥNKΛHTOΣ, and IEPOΣ ΔHMOΣ, the HOLY SENATE, and the HOLY PEOPLE, so frequent on Greek Imperial coins. These ideal persons are commonly seen in the same image of an ancient bearded head, crowned with laurel; sometimes, however, the latter appears as a youth.</P>
<P>Passing to the female deities, or goddesses, the first in dignity is,</P>
<P N="1">I. JUNO, known by the peacock, a bird sa∣cred to her from the fable of Argus. When she appears as the goddess of marriage, she is veiled to the middle, and sometimes to the toes. Her bust is that of a beautiful young woman, sometimes without any badge, which is distinc∣tion sufficient, as the rest of the goddesses have badges; and sometimes with a diadem.</P>
<PB N="75" REF="115"/>
<P N="2">II. The symbols of MINERVA are very re∣markable, consisting of her being in armour, with a spear in her right hand, and the aegis, or shield, with Medusa's head, in the other; an owl commonly standing beside her. Her bust is equally distinguishable from the helmet which she always wears: it is very common on the gold coin of Alexander the Great; and one cannot help laughing at the odd blunder of Elzevir, or his editor, who, in the best edition of Quintus Curtius, gave an head of this god∣dess for that of Alexander.</P>
<P N="3">III. DIANA is revealed by the crescent, by her bow and arrows, and often by her hounds. The Ephesian Diana, common upon Greek Im∣perial coins, appears with a number of <HI>mammae;</HI> she is supported by a couple of deer, and bears a panier of fruit on her head. The bust of Diana is known by the crescent on her brow, and sometimes by the bow, or quiver, engraved on one side.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The apple in her hand, the prize of beauty, declares VENUS. Sometimes she is only to be known by her total want of dress, without any other symbol. Her bust is distinguishable by her supreme beauty, and is often adorned with pearls around the neck. It might have been mentioned above, that CUPID sometimes appears on the Syrian coins, in half-length, as
<PB N="76" REF="116"/>painters call it, and is known by his infanc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and wings.</P>
<P N="5">V. CYBELE has the turreted crown, and lion<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or is seen in a chariot drawn by lions. Her bu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is known by the first-mentioned attribute.</P>
<P N="6">VI. CERES has the torches in her hands with which she is fabled to have gone in search of her daughter Proserpine. She has sometimes two serpents by her, and is sometimes drawn in a chariot by them. Her bust is readily known by the wheaten garland; and is most common on coins of Sicily, an island celebrated for it's fertility.</P>
<P N="7">VII. ISIS, an Egyptian goddess, has the sis∣trum in her hand, and a bud, or flower, on her head, symbolic of the eternal bloom of the in∣habitants of heaven<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plutarch de Iside.</NOTE>. The flower is said to be that of the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or southernwood, which is not very likely: it would rather seem to be that of a species of amaranth.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. ASTARTE, a Sidonian goddess, appears on a globe, supported by a chariot of two wheels, and drawn by two horses.</P>
<P>Such are the more eminent symbols and attributes of the deities; there only remain to be mentioned a few symbols, which stand by themselves, as figurative of persons or cir∣cumstances.</P>
<PB N="77" REF="117"/>
<P>Such are vases, with sprigs of plants issuing out of them, symbolic of solemn games. The small chest, or hamper, with a serpent leaping out of it, shews the mystic rites of Bacchus. Coins with the latter image are called <HI>cistophori;</HI> and a learned treatise has been published con∣cerning them.</P>
<P>The anchor on Seleucian medals marks the coin to be struck at Antioch, where an anchor was found upon digging the first foundations of the city, tho at a considerable distance from the sea.</P>
<P>A small seat, like a bushel pierced with many holes, upon which Apollo sits, in dif∣ferent coins of the princes of Syria, is that upon which the priest of Apollo at Daphne, near Antioch, used to sit to return oracles. It was placed over an aperture of the floor of the temple, through which the gale of inspiration was thought to arise.</P>
<P>Having discussed the most remarkable sym∣bols observed on the Greek coins, let us exa∣mine a very few of the Roman, which stand alone, and require explanation; for the deities and personifications on the Roman coins, as has been said, have not only attributes, but their names likewise in the legend of the medal, which renders it quite unnecessary to dwell upon them.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="118"/>
<P>An ensign on a Roman reverse, where stands alone, and without any persons, shews colony drawn from one legion; when many e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦signs or banners appear in the like circum∣stances, they evince the colony to have been drawn from as many legions as there are ensigns<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>A bull often represents Apis, and is often symbol of strength and security. Which of these is meant in the common coin of Julian, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> middle brass, esteemed large brass in that age<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when no larger was coined, upon the reverse o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which is a bull, with two stars over him, and the legend SECVRITAS REIPVB. I will not say.</P>
<P>The caduceus marks peace and concord; the cornucopia, abundance; the pontifical hat, the priesthood. They all appear upon a reverse o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Julius, and are symbols of the concord of the empire, and the plenty which attended his power. The last symbol only denotes that Caesar was Pontifex Maximus, not his attention to religion, as Pere Jobert religiously ex∣plains it.</P>
<P>The <HI>parazonium,</HI> observable on Roman coins, was a baton of command, and not a pointless dagger, as many antiquaries describe it to have been. This is evident from a reverse of Galba, HONOS ET VIRTUS, and other circumstances: it is always held as a baton, not placed by the side, or held by the handle, as a dagger. Why no Roman emperor or soldier appears on their coins with a sword by his side can never be ex∣plained
<PB N="79" REF="119"/>by antiquaries; much less why that weapon is never seen on their coins.</P>
<P>The instruments of sacrifice appear on many Roman coins, and are, 1. The <HI>secespita,</HI> or an oblong hatchet, or large knife, to kill the vic∣tim. 2. <HI>Aspersorium,</HI> or vessel for holy water, with which the priest sprinkled the assistants. 3. <HI>Simpullum,</HI> or the vessel for pouring wine on the sacrifice. 4. <HI>Patina,</HI> or <HI>patera,</HI> a dish for the fat, and other portions sacred to the gods. 5. <HI>Acerra,</HI> a little coffer of incense.</P>
<P>The <HI>lituus,</HI> or wand twisted round at the top, something like an episcopal staff, is a badge of the augurship; as the <HI>apex,</HI> or cap with strings, and terminating with a tuft, is of the pontificate.</P>
<P>The <HI>thensa,</HI> or divine chariot, which carried the image of a deity in sacred processions (im∣properly termed <HI>carpentum</HI> by some), is a badge of consecration of an empress; as is the peacock, which was the bird of Juno, the queen of Heaven. These sometimes appear without the legend <HI>Consecratio,</HI> as the <HI>thensa</HI> on a coin struck under Tiberius for the consecra∣tion of Livia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is well known that Livia took the name of Julia after her high marriage.</NOTE>, the wife of Augustus, S. P. Q. R. IVLIAE AVGVST.; and the peacock on that most rare silver coin of Julia, the daughter of Titus, the front of which has her bust, IVLIA AV∣GVSTA, and the reverse a peacock, DIVI TITI FILIA.</P>
<PB N="80" REF="120"/>
<P>The palm-tree, on both Greek and Roman coins, is symbolic of Phoenicia, where that tree flourished: as the <HI>silphium</HI> is of Cyrene, from the earliest times down to those of the Roman empire.</P>
<P>Before this section is dismissed, a few words must be said respecting the symbols observable on the obverses of ancient medals, consisting of the diadem, and other ornaments of the busts of eminent persons, to be found on them.</P>
<P>The diadem, or <HI>vitta,</HI> was a ribbon worn around the head, and tied in a floating knot be∣hind, anciently the simple, but superlative, badge of kingly power. It is observable on the Greek monarchic medals, from the earliest ages to the last; and is almost an infallible sign of the portrait of a prince. In the Roman coins it is seen on the consular ones of Numa and Ancus; but never after, if I am not mis∣taken, till the time of Licinius. So great an aversion had the Romans to this kingly distinc∣tion, that their emperors had, almost for an age, worn the radiated crown, peculiar to the gods, before they dared to assume this tyranni<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> badge. In the family of Constantine the dia∣dem becomes common, though not with the ancient simplicity, being ornamented on either edge with a row of pearls.</P>
<P>The radiated crown, at first, as on the post∣humous coins of Augustus, a mark of deifica∣tion,
<PB N="81" REF="121"/>was in little more than a century after put upon most of the emperors' heads in their se∣veral medals.</P>
<P>The crown of laurel was at first the honorary prize of conquerors, but afterwards commonly worn, at least in their medals, by all the Ro∣man emperors from Julius, who was permitted by the senate to wear it always, to hide the baldness of his forehead. This perhaps gave rise to the first emperors always appearing with it on their coins, a circumstance continued to our times with a most risible and truly Gothic absurdity. The laurel, employed by the an∣cients in forming their crowns, is undoubtedly what we term the Alexandrian laurel, a most beautiful evergreen, of a fine and tender ver∣dure.</P>
<P>Agrippa appears on his coins with the rostral crown, a sign of naval victory or command, being made of gold, in resemblance of prows of ships tied together. He is likewise seen with the mural or turreted crown, the prize of first ascending the walls of an enemy's city.</P>
<P>The oaken, or civic crown, is frequent on reverses, as of Galba, and others; and was the badge of having saved the life of a citizen, or of many citizens.</P>
<P>Besides the diadem, the Greek princes some∣times appear with the laurel crown. The Ar∣sacidae, or kings of Parthia, wear a kind of
<PB N="82" REF="122"/>sash round the head, with their hair in rows o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> curls like a wig. Tigranes, and the kings o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Armenia, wear the <HI>tiara,</HI> a singular kind o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cap, but the well known badge of imperia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power in the ancient eastern world. Xerxes, a petty prince of Armenia, appears in a coi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> extant of him in a conic cap, with a diadem around it. Juba the father has a singular crown, like a conic cap made of leaves of oak.</P>
<P>The kings of Syria assumed, by way of dis∣tinction, different symbols of deity, to be ob∣served on the busts of their medals. Such a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the lion's skin of Hercules, which surrounds the head of the first Seleucus; the ram's hor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> placed behind the ear, a scriptural image o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their strength and power, or of their being the successors of Alexander, called the son of Jupi∣ter Ammon; the wing placed, in like manner, behind the ear, symbolic of the rapidity of their conquests, or of their descendance from the god Mercury; and the like.</P>
<P>The empresses and queens never, so far as I remember, are seen with the diadem of any kind. The variety of their head-dresses more than compensates for the want of this orna∣ment.</P>
<P>Besides the distinctions of supreme power, or honorary reward, there are other symbolic or∣naments of the head observable on some Ro∣man coins which ought to be mentioned. Such
<PB N="83" REF="123"/>is the veil, or more properly the <HI>toga,</HI> drawn over the head, to be seen on the busts of Julius Caesar and Lepidus on their coins. This shews that the person bore the pontificate, or the au∣gurship; the augurs having a particular gown, called <HI>laena,</HI> with which they covered their heads when employed in observing the omens. The veil of Faustina and other empresses, denotes them to have held some sacred dignity.</P>

<P>MOST coins, along with the portrait it front and various figures in the reverse have likewise words, explicative of some cir∣cumstance concerning them, marked on one o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> both sides. The early Greek coins of cities commonly only contain the name of the city, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the initial letters of it; as those of the Greek princes their name, the beginning characters of it, or its monogram<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A monogram, with medallists, is the name of a prince, city or the like, of which the characters are woven together, so <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> speak, and the limb of one character perhaps applies to three o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> four others; so that in the small room of one or two characters <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whole name is comprehended.</NOTE>. But in the Roman
<PB N="85" REF="125"/>and Greek imperial medals there is some∣times not only a literal information around the face, and around the reverse, but likewise in the field of the reverse, which in such instances often consists wholly of this intelligence, with∣out any figures whatever. When the letters or words of a medal thus occupy the field, they are called an <HI>inscription;</HI> but when they run round the margin, are on either side of the figures, or upon the exergue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The exergue is the bottom of a coin, commonly separated from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he field by a line, upon which the figures of the reverse stand. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is so called from being <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>out of the work</HI> of the medal.</NOTE>, they are denominated a <HI>le∣gend.</HI></P>
<P>The French, who are fond of devices, call the figures the <HI>body,</HI> and the legend the <HI>soul,</HI> of a medal.</P>
<P>The legends of the earliest Greek coins, as above observed, are very brief, rehearsing only the initials of the city, or prince; as AΘE, money of Athens; AM, money coined by Au∣myntas king of Macedon. Afterwards the name is put at full length, as ΣΥPAKOΥΣIΩN, coin of the Syracusians; ΦIΛIΠIIOΥ, coin of Philip of Macedon. In process of time the Syrian and Egyptian kings, successors of Alex∣ander, added some epithet which did them praise, as EΥEPΓETHΣ, beneficent, or the like; together with the title of BAΣIΛEΥΣ, or king; and the year of their aera in which the coin was
<PB N="86" REF="126"/>struck. Such the Greek coinage remained till the universality of the Roman empire swallowed up all the kingdoms and cities which used that language.</P>
<P>Under the dominion of the Roman emperor<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Grecian mint assumed more of the Roman form, then indeed more perfect, as to legend, than their own. On the face they gave the Roman emperor, or empress, with their titles; the founder of their city, with his name; the senate, or the people of Rome, who had pro∣tected them; or the ideal bust of the genius o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their city: while the reverse presents us with a legend indicative of the name of the magistrate under whom the money was struck; of some treaty entered into with one or more neigh∣bouring states; of the river, or deity, repre∣sented; and the like. Yet it must be observed, to the credit of the Greek artists, even when their genius was depressed by the Roman power, that they seldom or never explain by their legends the reverses of their coins, but leave it to the spectator; commonly, and al∣most universally, putting for the legend of the reverse the name of the city, and frequently adding that of the magistrate. The symbols of the deities were indeed so familiar as to require no explanatory legend; and personifications are very rare in Greek coins, except those of their cities and rivers. A few instances how∣ever
<PB N="87" REF="127"/>occur of them, and they are commonly accompanied by an illustrative legend; as on the reverse of a very rare Otho, where we see his victory over Galba, imaged by a placid female figure, with a victory in one hand, and a tro∣phy in the other, with this legend, KPAΣIΣ, Moderation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spon, Voyage du Levant, tome III.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Inscriptions filling the whole field of the re∣verse are not so common in Greek coins. A few however there are, and particularly upon those of Smyrna. The imperial medals struck at Antioch are always very remarkable, from the letters S. C. inscribed on their reverses, within a peculiar crown, or wreath. Sometimes they have longer inscriptions; as in that most capi∣tal coin of Otho, of large brass, which is in Dr. Hunter's collection; upon which we read, within the usual wreath of Antiochian medals, EIII MOΥKIANOΥ ANTIOXEΩN, with the aera ET. ZIP. How the people of Antioch hap∣pened to adopt the S. C. signifying SENATVS CONSVLTO, "by decree of the senate," a mark almost peculiar to the Roman mint, in so many of their imperial coins, is a paradox not ex∣plained, and not attempted to be explained, by medallic authors.</P>
<P>This leads me to observe, that the noted S. C. or mark of the authority of the senate of
<PB N="88" REF="128"/>Rome for striking any coin, never appears upon those of gold or silver, in the sense we are to construe it, when it occurs upon the brass, Medallists lay it down as an infallible rule, that this mark upon gold and silver coins always re∣fers to the subject of the reverse upon which it is stamped, and not to the coin itself. So far as we can learn, the Roman emperors had the sole disposal of the gold and silver coinage, but lest that of brass entirely to the senate. Hence the S. C. is never wanting upon the brass, and in very few instances appears upon the superior metals; where it is always understood to refer to the device of the coin, as a statue, a trium∣phal arch, or the like, erected by decree of the senate; and not to the coin itself, as issued in virtue of that decree.</P>
<P>The simplicity of the legends to be found upon the early Greek coins has already fallen under observation; those of the Roman, with equal simplicity at first, by degrees proceeded to more explicit length, and at length, from elegant and simple veracity, degenerated into flattery. These remarks refer to the legends of the obverse, for those of the reverse began to flatter as soon as there was a prince, an idol upon whose altar to burn the cloudy perfume. We find Clemency and Moderation upon the medals of Tiberius, as well as equivalent vir∣tues upon those of Titus. The DIVI FILIVS,
<PB N="89" REF="129"/>"the son of Augustus the deity," upon the ob∣verses of Tiberius, is a title more of security than flattery: but upon those of the following princes we find nothing more than their names, with the date of their Tribunician power, or of their Consulship, and the glorious title of PATER PATRIAE, the father of their country, till Com∣modus added the title of FELIX, followed by that of PIVS, and at length by the tyrannic pre∣face of D. N., DOMINVS NOSTER, Our Lord. In the lower empire Michael first assumed the proud addition of BAΣIΛEΥΣ, or king; which was followed by that of ΔHΣΠOTOΣ, or despot.</P>
<P>The reverses of the very first imperial coins are not however wanting in adulation, nor is it to be wondered at, when we consider that Virgil and Horace, men of the most enlightened minds, whatever may be decided of their claim to ge∣nius, were yet capable of even forgetting the sa∣cred dignity of poetry, and prostituting it at the bloody footstool of a tyrant. What Montes∣quieu says of the English, that, if ever they were reduced to be slaves, they would prove the meanest of all slaves, was exemplified in the conduct of the ancient Romans. This can no way be better proved than from the coin struck by decree of the senate, in which we find all the virtues ascribed to the most infamous set of monsters that ever disgraced humanity. It may
<PB N="90" REF="130"/>however be said, in vindication of the Romans that the ascribing of virtues to princes, from whose hearts they were most distant, was the only method which they dared to use to remin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them of their duty to their subjects.</P>
<P>In a short time, however, a succession of vir∣tuous monarchs authorised the reverses so fo∣reign to most of their praedecessors. S. P. Q R. OPTIMO PRINCIPI, so common on the coins o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trajan, is not flattery, but glory. All the vir∣tues appear without impropriety on the medals of Nerva, Trajan, Adrian, and the Antonini.</P>
<P>Almost equal in justice and glory to the OP∣TIMO PRINCIPI of Trajan is a reverse of the emperor Justinian, on which is the portrait o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Belisarius, with this legend, GLORIA ROMANO∣RVM<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Patin, Hist. des Medailles. I have never seen this coin either in books or cabinets.</NOTE>. But, in proportion as the empire de∣clined, the more common are flattery and gross impropriety in the legends of the Roman coin. So early as the time of Severus we find this upon one of Julia his wife, MATer AVGG. MA∣Ter SENATVS, MATer PATRIAE.</P>
<P>The Greeks, ingenious in faults as in virtues, likewise carried their flattery of their Roman masters as far as it would well go. Certain it is that they surpassed the Romans themselves in this base art. We have a Greek medal of
<PB N="91" REF="131"/>Commodus with a legend, implying that while that emperor reigned all the world was blest; a piece of adulation and falshood only to be equalled by an inscription preserved in the gar∣den of the Villa Borghese at Frascati, and for∣merly placed under a statue of Caracalla, in which, among other titles, is NVMINI PRAE∣SENTI, "to the present deity." Among other instances of the Grecian art of conciliating the favour of their masters, may be mentioned that of first winning the protection of the empress, and other imperial ladies, by striking beautiful medals in their honour: a flattery to which we are indebted for many a fine portrait not to be found in the Roman coinage.</P>
<P>But it is time that we should proceed to some few other particulars observable in the legends of ancient medals. Upon many of the coins struck in the Greek cities we find the legend of the obverse in Latin, while that of the reverse is in Greek. The reason of this, medallic writers have endeavoured to account for in many ways, but appear not to me to have lighted upon the truth, which seems to be, that the magistrate of such country mint, not having any portrait of the emperor, sent to Rome for one, which was returned in a die ready cut with the legend. To this a reverse was made by the Greek artists, the magistrate inclining to save the expence of cutting another obverse. In confirmation of this
<PB N="92" REF="132"/>opinion, I believe, it will be found that few <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no coins are found with Latin legends on th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reverse and Greek, in front.</P>
<P>Perhaps the most remarkable feature in th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> legends and inscriptions of Greek imperial me∣dals is the addition, almost perpetual, of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> title NEΩKOPOΣ to the names of certain cities The word is equivalent to the Latin <HI>Aedituus</HI> and will, in spite of my reader's smile, bear th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> English interpretation of Churchwarden<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The word is derived by the etymologists from <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>a temple,</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to sweep:</HI> the humble primitive meaning is therefore <HI>temple-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eepers.</HI> In Acts xix. 35, we are told that Ephesus was the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or city devoted to the worship of Diana.</NOTE>. I implies that the cities who adopted that appel∣lation looked upon themselves as guardians o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the shrine of some celebrated deity, whose de∣voted worshippers they were; and of conse∣quence blest in the immediate and peculiar protection of such heavenly power. At other times it signifies solely the latter circumstan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of particular favour; and in this sense we meet with NEΩKOPΩN TOΥ ΣEBAΣTOΥ, the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of the emperor, and the like; tho in some instances this may be doubtless applied in the full sense of the word; for temples of different ΣEBAΣTOI, or emperors, were frequent in the Greek cities, as marks of superlative flattery. Nor let us wonder that the most important Greek cities esteemed themselves honoured in a
<PB N="93" REF="133"/>title which to us appears, at first glanoe, so trifling; for the celebrated temples, such as that of Diana at Ephesus, and others, were the grand sources of all the wealth and power of those cities who were their guardians. By them strangers were induced to crowd their streets, and lay out their money to enrich the inhabitants. Hence their wealth: and all pos∣sible power was derived from the vast influence which these holy cities had over others, in vir∣tue of the sacred deposits committed to their care, and the imaginary, but no less strong, horror of the present deity. Both the autho∣rity and the opulence of these cities were in∣creased by solemn and pompous games, cele∣brated at distant periods, in honour of their guardian divinity. At these games the empe∣rors, sometimes present, and at other times by commission, caused such cities to be solemnly proclaimed NEΩKOPOI, as a singular badge of their favour: and hence in coins and inscrip∣tions we often find B. NEΩKOPΩN, T. NEΩ∣KOPΩN, ΔIΣ NEΩKOPΩN, TPIΣ NEΩKO∣PΩN, implying that the inhabitants had been twice or thrice, or oftener, honoured with this solemn distinction.</P>
<P>A circumstance almost as remarkable of the Roman medals, is the inscription VOT. V. MVI. T. X., VOT. X. MVLTIS XX., to be found upon many reverses, and most commonly marked on a
<PB N="94" REF="134"/>shield, or within a crown of laurel. This Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cange interprets to refer to the artifice of Au∣gustus, who pretended to lay down his power, and resume it for ten years longer as at the re∣quest of the senate. This term, says he, was by succeeding emperors shortened to five; and solemn vows were entered into by their subjects for their safety to the end of that period; nay, that double that period might be allotted to their reign, again to be prolonged, in the wishes of their people, to a further date. To confute this opinion, we need only refer to the coins of Crispus, and the other Caesars, upon which this inscription is so common, and from which it is palpable that it can have no reference to their reign, nor to the art of Augustus. However, while the opinion of Du Cange is rejected, it must be confessed that no other interpretation has been offered, and this inscription must, so far as can be seen, be left in obscurity.</P>
<P>The compass of a coin is so small, that artists have always been obliged to use abbreviations in the legends and inscriptions. An explana∣tion of the most common of these, originally drawn up by Patin, will be found in the Ap∣pendix. For any which do not there occur, the reader may have recourse to the large work of Ursatus, <HI>De Notis Romanorum.</HI> The Greeks do not deal so much in abbreviations, and when
<PB N="95" REF="135"/>they use them, so much of the word is commonly given as to leave no doubt of the whole. A very little study of the Greek medals will enable any one to peruse their legends with facility, especially with the assistance of any work on Greek coins. It may however be observed, that the interpretation of letters which do not often occur is a dangerous attempt, either with regard to the Roman or Greek coins. The risible blunders of father Hardouin on the for∣mer are well known; and it was Fortunius Li∣cetus, a man of learning, who discovered that A. IΔ., upon a coin of Hadrian, implying the fourteenth year of his reign, signified <HI>Lucernas invenit Delta;</HI> and who from thence ascribed the invention of lanthorns to Egypt.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XIII.</HI> Medallions.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE we proceed to the particular con∣sideration of the coins of different nations, it will be proper to examine the medallions. Under this term are included all those pieces, produced by the ancient mints, which, from their superior size, were evidently not intended for circulation as coin, but for other occasions. Such were public games, when the emperor used to scatter them among the people; whence the Romans called them <HI>Missilia:</HI>—a dangerous diversion for the mob, whatever amusement the struggle might afford to the superior spectators! Medallions were likewise presented by the em∣peror to his friends, and by the mint-masters to
<PB N="97" REF="137"/>the emperor, as specimens of fine workmanship: they were struck upon the commencement of the reign of a new emperor, and other solemn occasions: and frequently, the Greek in par∣ticular, as monuments of gratitude, or of flat∣tery. Sometimes they were merely what we would call trial, or pattern, pieces; <HI>testimonia probatae monetae;</HI> and such must be the most uncommon.</P>
<P>It has been already observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. VI.</NOTE>, that all Roman pieces in gold, exceeding the denarius aureus; all in silver, superior in size to the denarius; and all in brass, superior to the <HI>as,</HI> or what the medallists term large brass; fall under this de∣scription. Such, at least, is the common divi∣sion; but, in my opinion, the gold medallions weighing two, three, or four aurei only, passed in currency as the Greek gold didrachms, tri∣drachms, or tetradrachms, according to their size. The like may be said of the silver, which are not rare, and are commonly of the value of a Greek tetradrachm: they, I have little doubt, went in currency for four denarii. This opi∣nion may be confirmed by observing, that, in our own coinage, the five and two guinea pieces, and the crowns in silver, are as scarce in pro∣portion as the Roman gold and silver medal∣lions.</P>
<PB N="98" REF="138"/>
<P>But whether any of these pieces called me¦dallions passed as coin with the ancients, is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> matter of no moment; it is sufficient to have pointed out what articles are now accounted o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that class. The brass medallions, as the largest so are commonly of the most exquisite work manship, and uncommon device. Many o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them are composed of two sorts of metal, th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> center being copper, with a ring of brass around it; or the contrary. The inscription of such sometimes bites upon both metals, and at othe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> times runs upon one. Medallions of this kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are inimitable, and of undoubted antiquity.</P>
<P>Medallions, from the time of Julius to tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Hadrian, are very uncommon, and of va<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> price: from Hadrian to Postumus they are generally speaking, less rare: very few meda¦llions appear after Postumus; and so few of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> large brass coins, that they always rank wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> medallions of the reigns of all the succeedin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> princes.</P>
<P>Hardly any Roman medallion is to be foun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of which the whole type is not repeated upo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common coin. Hence they appear not of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> much importance as the Greek, whereof th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> impressions are frequently most uncommon, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no where else to be found. A remarkable di<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tinction between the Greek and Roman meda¦llions lies in their different thickness, the R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣man
<PB N="99" REF="139"/>being often three or four lines thick, while the other seldom exceed one. When I speak of the Greek medallions, I mean those struck in the imperial periods: for few or no Greek medallions are found prior to the emperors of Rome.</P>
<P>All medallions, save in one or two instances, are very rare, and of princely purchase; for which reason I shall not enlarge any more upon them, but content myself with observing, that, even in the richest cabinets, twenty or thirty medallions are esteemed of great weight. In the last century, however, Christina, queen of Sweden, was so fortunate as to procure about three hundred; and the king of France's cabi∣net, the most opulent and wonderful collection of medals ever seen, has by degrees attained to about twelve hundred medallions; a number in former times not believed to exist.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XIV.</HI> Medals called <HI>Contorniati.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THIS class ought likewise to be discussed before proceeding to the common coin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of antiquity. They are so called from the Ita∣lian CONTORNIATO, <HI>encircled;</HI> because of the hollow circle which commonly runs around them: and are not distinguished from medal∣lions by their size, but by their thinness; fain<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relief; reverses sometimes in <HI>intaglio,</HI> hollowed, not raised; and, in general, by their peculia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and inferior workmanship.</P>
<P>Many and various have been the opinions o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> medallic writers respecting these singular piece<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="101" REF="141"/>of coinage. Some suppose them struck by Gallienus, to the memory of illustrious men, and celebrated <HI>athletae,</HI> at the time when he caused all the consecration coins of his pre∣decessors to be restored. This sentiment seems nearly adopted by M. Mahudel, who says, the <HI>contorniati</HI> were struck originally at Rome, about the close of the third century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist, de l'Acad. des Belles Lettres, tome V. p. 284.</NOTE>. Others ascribe their invention to Greece, and that in her days of glory; because they bear frequently the names and images of illustrious Greeks, as Homer, Pythagoras, Socrates; and of Grecian <HI>athletae,</HI> or actors in the games.</P>
<P>Other opinions have been given, which to enumerate were superfluous. I shall therefore content myself with submitting an opinion to the reader, which I have as yet found in no author, together with a few arguments to en∣force it.</P>
<P>Upon the very first sight I had of <HI>contorniati</HI> coins, it struck me that they could be nothing else than tickets for different places in the pub∣lic games. The dye, appearance, device, in∣scription of the reverse, every thing, confirmed this opinion, which I have since had the plea∣sure to find perfectly consonant to that of two or three of the first medallists in this country.</P>
<PB N="102" REF="142"/>
<P>These pieces, tho of different kinds, are mostly of a size between two and three inche<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> diameter. Some have, upon the obverse part<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the head of the emperor, or empress, who gave the games; and almost a series might be formed of them, from Augustus down to Gal∣lienus. What strengthens my opinion very much is, that such emperors as were remarkable for their attachment to public diversions occur very frequently on these pieces, which we shall in future call <HI>ticket-medals,</HI> if the reader will; whereas the others appear more seldom, and those who never presented any games, not at all. Nero, for instance, is so common on their ob∣verses, that his ticket-medals sell for almost no price at all.</P>
<P>Other obverses are most precious from pre∣serving to us the portraits of illustrious authors of antiquity, no where else to be found. Sal∣lust, Horace, and other Roman writers, were delineated on these tickets, when the memory of their persons was yet fresh to the inhabitants of Rome, and their portraits may therefore be depended on. So much cannot be said for the Greek portraits, in this way, of Homer, Solon, Pythagoras, Socrates, and others, all which I take to have been struck at Rome, when Gre∣cian actors were to perform; or in the Grecian cities during the Roman empire. However,
<PB N="103" REF="143"/>even these are valuable, as being ancient, and perhaps traditional, portraits of those great men.</P>
<P>A few obverses again present <HI>athletae,</HI> or actors in the games, and such are commonly represented holding a horse by the rein, or in some other attitude peculiar to their profession.</P>
<P>But the reverses present the most certain ar∣guments for the opinion I have advanced with regard to the use of these pieces: for on them there is almost always a charioteer driving a chariot, or some similar device, peculiar to public games, and to them alone. Those struck for the theatre are the most scarce, and have sometimes an actor at full length on the reverse, with PLACEAS, "mayest thou please!" or some such legend. One, in particular, has a bust of Sallust on the obverse; and on the other side, three persons, one of whom has an instrument resembling the common flute; an∣other, an instrument like the scenic flute seen in the hands of Pan; while the third is de∣claiming. The legend is PETRONI PLACEAS, "mayest thou please, Petronius!" The person represented declaiming is evidently this Petro∣nius, who was perhaps that day to make his first appearance upon the Roman stage; and the whole design, of this last instance in parti∣cular, is so clear, that it moves surprize how
<PB N="104" REF="144"/>the intention of these tickets could so long have escaped the medallic authors<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tickets of this kind are used for the pit, to this day, at ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> theatres. The practice is at least as ancient as Charles II. for <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very fine one of that prince, with his bust, without titles a front, and FOR THE PIT on the reverse, may be seen in the British Museum; as well as another of William and Mary, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same model.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It has been said above, that these pieces wer<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tickets for different seats or places at the games What leads to this supposition is the variety o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marks to be found on the obverses of them Some have a sprig of laurel; others a P, wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an E below it, which last is very common others, a particular animal, or some such badge All these marks, in such tickets as are perfectly preserved, are cut in the brass, and then filled up with silver. There is in the British Museum a fine collection of upwards of one hundred of these pieces, presented to that noble institu∣tion by the Earl of Exeter, upon one of which the head of an empress, Faustina, I think, i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> singularly adorned with a line of silver border∣ing her head-dress, and another around he<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> neck. The particular marks, I have no doubt referred to the different honourable seats to which the tickets conducted.</P>
<P>The pieces of this class with imperial por∣traits are of very little value; those bearing the images of illustrious men are precious, tho no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XV.</HI> Greek Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE Greek coins, if not the most ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which we have, are at least of superior antiquity to any whose dates can be clearly au¦thenticated. Perhaps some of the Barbari<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pieces, those of Persia, or other eastern coun∣tries, for instance, may have a claim to priority of aera; but as that claim is latent, and mus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ever be so, owing to such coins having no le∣gends, or legends in characters irretrievably lost, we must allot to the Grecian medals that place in a cabinet, from their antiquity, which their workmanship might ensure to them, in∣dependent of that adventitious consideration.</P>
<PB N="107" REF="147"/>
<P>The invention of coinage, like that of other fine arts, is very obscure. We know that the Egyptians, who claim the origin of many of the arts, have no title to this; for no Egyptian coins with hieroglyphics are found; nor any that are charged with the deities of Nile, till the introduction of the Greek language into that country under the Ptolemies.</P>
<P>Herodotus, in his first book, informs us, that the people of Lydia, a country in Asia Minor, are supposed to have been the first who coined money. This is thought to have been about the time of Homer, upwards of one thousand years before the Christian aera.</P>
<P>Whether this art was really invented by the Lydians, and by them first substituted to the ancient eastern mode of weighing the metal, or whether they received it from their more eastern neighbours the Persians, and were con∣sidered by the Greeks as the original inventors, because they handed the art to Greece, cannot be decided. Lydia was, for many centuries after the period to which this invention is ascribed, a powerful and opulent kingdom, till Croesus the last king, so celebrated for his wealth, was conquered by Cambyses king of Persia; so that it is not at all improbable that to so rich and flourishing a state<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he very origin of coinage may be due.</P>
<PB N="108" REF="148"/>
<P>Leaving these uncertainties, we know fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> respectable authorities that the first mone coined in Greece was that struck in the islan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Aegina, by Phidon king of Argos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strabo, lib. VIII. Aelian, in his Various History, book xii. ch. 10. is another witness of the first Greek coins being struck in Aegina, tho he makes no mention of Phidon, but dwells upon the wealth and power of the islanders, and their fortitude displayed against the Persians; then adds, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> that is, <Q>they first struck mo∣ney, “”which from them was called Aeginaion.</Q></NOTE>. H<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reign is fixed by the Arundelian marbles to a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> aera correspondent to the 885th year before Christ; but whether he derived this art from Lydia, or any other source, we are not told Many of these coins are extant; for I make n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scruple to ascribe all those with the rude figur<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a tortoise on one side, and an indented squar<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> on the other, to this coinage. Medallists, in deed, impute them to Aegium in Achaia, a place almost unknown, and where, I will ven¦ture to say, there never was a shadow of a mint; merely because they look upon the tor∣toise as a sure symbol of coins struck some∣where in the Peloponnesus: when the most superficial examination must convince them that these symbols are most uncertain, every city having a great number, and perpetually chang∣ing them, so that no man would found any thing upon them, except one who is found of building castles in the air. Besides, granting
<PB N="109" REF="149"/>their position, that the tortoise is a badge of cities of the Peloponnesus, was not Argos one of the most important of those cities? and does not our ancient authority inform us, that this money was struck in Aegina, by Phidon king of the Argives?</P>
<P>I have dwelt the longer on this point be∣cause that in great cabinets these coins com∣monly occur; and it is a curious fact that these are the most ancient that can be any ways iden∣tified. Not to mention that it is a singular in∣stance of the uncertainty of some parts of this science, and how ill the general principles of medallic writers apply to particular examples, as this of a king of Argos establishing his mint in Aegina. Indeed, when a medallic au∣thor falls into an error, he is commonly blindly followed by his successors, who are generally inclined to save the trouble of consulting the original authors of antiquity, by taking upon credit the superficial opinions of those who have written on the science before them. By this blunders are propagated to an endless degree: and the last medallic writers seek to cover their depredations from the former only by railing at them in conversation; in imitation of Voltaire's conduct to Shakspere.</P>
<P>These coins of Aegina, and all others of most remote antiquity, may be distinguished by these infallible marks: 1. Their oval circum∣ference,
<PB N="110" REF="150"/>and globous swelling shape. 2. Ari∣tiquity of alphabet. 3. The characters being retrograde; or the first division of the legend in the common style, while the next is retro∣grade. 4. The indented square, described in a former section, on the reverse. 5 The simple structure of the mintage. 6. Some of the largest very old coins are hollowed on the re∣verse with the image impressed on the front. 7. The dress, symbols, &amp;c. are of the rudest design and execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Froelich, Notitia Elementaris Numismatum.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Besides these coins of Aegina, many ancient medals of different states occur with all these marks of profound antiquity. Those of Athens, Tegea, and two or three other cities; some Persian silver pieces, with the archer upon one side, and the hollow square upon the other; several coins of the first kings of Macedon, are examples. There is in the British Museum, a medal of silver, ascribed to Lesbos, of this de∣scription, upon which much has been said and written. The art must have circulated widely before the square on the reverse was obliterated by superior art in the fabric; for I have seen a silver drachm of Cyrene, with the <HI>sylphium</HI> upon one side, and a head of Jupiter Ammon upon the other, evidently of Grecian workmanship, upon both sides of which the square was very visible.</P>
<PB N="111" REF="151"/>
<P>But in a short time the Greek coins assumed that elegance which they were ever afterwards to afford. Innumerable of the medals of cities, which, from the character, we must judge of highest antiquity, have a surprizing strength, beauty, and relief, in their impressions. Many of those of the early Macedonian, and other monarchs, are entitled to no less praise: but, about the time of Alexander the Great, the art seems to have attained its very highest perfec∣tion.</P>
<P>It is something surprising, with regard to the coins of this prince, that his own portrait so seldom occurs on them; or, if it does, is so dis∣guised, that medallists, after describing those with the bust of Hercules, of Jupiter Ammon, and a variety of others, as infallibly stamped with the image of Alexander, and being forced to relinquish these opinions by finding those very heads upon coins struck before the birth of that prince, seem at last determined to be∣lieve that no head of Alexander is to be found on any medal whatever. But this opinion is doubtless too wide. Where a coin of this cele∣brated monarch occurs with the head bare, or circled with a diadem, there can be no doubt of its bearing his portrait. The coins of Alex∣ander are all very common, save silver di∣drachms, which are so rare as to be almost unique. His reverses commonly bear a Jupiter
<PB N="112" REF="152"/>sitting, with the eagle on his hand; and ha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> besides different small symbols, as mint-mark denoting the places where they were coine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> These, if we trust a very celebrated medall<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Medallic works of Pellerin, published at Paris, 1762, <HI>et se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 10 vols. 4to.

<P>The coins of the Syrian and Egyptian kings successors of Alexander, yield not to his i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> beauty and bold relief. Even the Parthia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coins of the Arsacidae are worthy the Grecian workmen, whose they are, as is evident from th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Greek legends imprest on them; in very many of which these monarchs assume the singula<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> title of ΦIΛEΛHNIKOΣ, or LOVER OF THE GREEKS. Most of the Parthian coins are drachms; the other sizes frequently occur it those of Egypt and Syria.</P>
<P>How the Grecian language and character come to appear upon the latter Parthian me∣dals,
<PB N="113" REF="153"/>cannot be explained, but from the excel∣lence, and consequent universality, of that speech at the time. Indeed it is no wonder, that a language, in which genius had first spoken, should have attracted the admiration of all nations. The Grecian tongue acquired that preeminence from its writers, which the Latin gained afterwards from the force of the Roman arms alone; for no writer in that language displayed that miraculous originality of genius which shines in the Grecian productions. The best Roman writers thought themselves fortu∣nate if they could steal from the Greeks with some dexterity; and their Virgil, whom they fondly classed as their first poet, obtained that title because he was the chief of the robbers, and had not a single thing in his possession which was not stolen. It is amusing to observe upon medals the progress of the Greek tongue: the very improvement of the character, and other trifles, delight the legitimate admirer of the divine writers of that great country; him I mean who reads them in the original lan∣guage, where only they are to be known in all their beauty and majesty. From the intro∣duction of some characters, the antiquity also of Greek coins may be ascertained; the H and Ω, for instance, not being known in Greece till the archonship of Euclid, which falls into the

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XVI.</HI> Roman Medals.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a little surprising, that, tho the Grecian coinage was carried to high perfection before the foundation of Rome, yet near two centuries more should elapse ere any mint was known to the Romans. For, according to the best authorities<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. XXXIII. C. iii.</NOTE>, it was in the reign of Servius Tullius that the first Roman coins were struck, which were large pieces of brass, rudely im∣pressed, on one side only, with the figure of an ox, a ram, or some other animal, whence money it is said derived its Latin term of <HI>pecu∣nia.</HI> These symbols, the ox in particular, were
<PB N="118" REF="158"/>derived from the coins of the Umbri, a people of Italy, originally Lydians, according to He<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> rodotus<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Herodot. lib. 1. de Lydis loq. T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Etruseans were likewise a colony from Lydia.</NOTE>, which are distinguished by tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> token, and unknown characters, resembling the Errusean, to this day. So that it would ap∣pear that not only Greece, but Italy, was in∣debted to the Lydians for the tradition, if no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the invention, of coinage.</P>
<P>The pieces of Servius Tullius would seem to have been divided into two sizes; the <HI>dupondius,</HI> or piece of two pounds weight; and the <HI>libella,</HI> or that weighing one pound. The term <HI>aes,</HI> or <HI>as,</HI> seems to have been indiscriminately ap∣plied to both, and indeed with no impropriety, signifying merely <HI>a piece of brass:</HI> but at length it was confined to the latter, the coinage of the former having totally ceased, after a very short duration, abridged by its weight and unwieldy inconvenience; circumstances but too eminent even in the smaller denomination.</P>
<P>In the progress of time the impression of the <HI>as</HI> was changed to that of a bust of Janus, upon the front, and the prow of a ship on the reverse; and, for the more general utility, pieces of inferior weight and value were coined. They bore a relative and ascertained value to the parent coin: the <HI>semis</HI> being half the <HI>as;</HI> the <HI>triens,</HI> a third part; the <HI>quadrans,</HI> a fourth
<PB N="119" REF="159"/>part; and the <HI>sextans,</HI> a sixth. While the <HI>as</HI> continued a pound weight, these parts conse∣quently contained proportional ounces, the Roman pound always consisting of twelve; and the ounce of seven denarii, as the Grecian of eight drachms. But the Romans, being much reduced by the Punic wars, and other public calamities, were obliged to lower the size of their coin so much that the <HI>as</HI> fell down to the weight of one ounce, and its divisions in proportion. They continued in this state till about the reign of Gallus, when the <HI>as,</HI> or largest brass coin, appears again to have been lowered one half in size; for, after that period, the middle brass, or what was esteemed the <HI>semis</HI> in former times, occurs in the usual proportion of the large brass of the preceding reigns; and this last is so very unfrequent that it classes with medallions.</P>
<P>The consular brass coins of Rome are not so interesting as those of silver, but, in return, the imperial series of large brass is the most im∣portant of all the Roman coinage. The small brass medals are rare of the early emperors, and the large and middle brass of the latter.</P>
<P>This article must not be left without ob∣serving that the notorious <HI>spintriae</HI> of Tiberius, some of the most infamous monuments of vice which any art has produced, class with the
<PB N="120" REF="160"/>small brass coins of the early princes. They have no obverse, but the Roman numerals I. II. III. &amp;c. inscribed in the center: the re∣verses—but I blush for the degradation of human nature.</P>
<P>Having treated, in such limits as our work will allow, of the earliest, being the brass, coinage of Rome, let us proceed to the next in point of antiquity, namely that of silver.</P>
<P>Pliny tells us it was about the 485th year of Rome, that is, about 300 years after the first brass coinage, and 266 before the Christian period, that the first silver issued from the Ro∣man mint. The denarius was the first and last principal form which it assumed, for the other sizes are so very scarce that it is clear few were ever struck. This was at first stamped with a head of Rome in front, and x., or a star, to mark that it was worth ten ases; and upon the reverse bore Castor and Pollux on horseback, or a chariot of victory. Afterwards the busts of different deities were given on the obverse; and, in process of time, about the seventh century of Rome, those of illustrious men, such as Ancus Martius, Numa, and others, whose deaths had long secured their virtues from envy. But, till the age of Julius, a century after, no portrait of a living personage appears upon any Roman medal: Caesar was indeed the very
<PB N="121" REF="161"/>first who assumed that high honour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dio, lib. XI. IV.</NOTE>. A good judge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">De la Bastie, in his notes to the last edition of La Science des Medailles, 1739.</NOTE> observes, that there is very small dif∣ference in the workmanship of the best and worst silver consular coins upon which illus∣trious names occur: this leads him to think, that the plan of engraving on coins the names of great men and magistrates, was only intro∣duced about the time of Marius and Sylla.</P>
<P>The reverses of the silver consular medals are fraught with much erudition and curiosity. We frequently find remarkable actions, and other matters, represented on them in no mean taste. Thus on a coin of the family of Aemi∣lia, with this legend, M. LEPIDVS PONT. MAX. TVTOR REGIS, Lepidus appears in the dress of a consul, and puts the crown upon the head of young Ptolemy, whom his father had left to the tutorage of the Roman people. On the obverse is the turreted head of the city Alex∣andria in Egypt, with ALEXANDREA. So, in the same family, there is a medal, with a youth on horseback carrying a trophy, with this le∣gend, M. LEPIDVS ANNORVM XV. PRAETEXTA∣TVS HOSTEM OCCIDIT CIVEM SERVAVIT. Many other instances might be given of the curiosity and importance of consular medals in silver,
<PB N="122" REF="162"/>but I hasten to speak a little of the imperia series in this metal, after just hinting that, b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consular coins, medallists only imply tho<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> struck by the curators, and afterwards by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> triumviri of the money, during the time of th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consuls, until Julius assumed the suprem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> power. The names upon this suite, from which complete catalogues of the Roman illustrious families have been arranged, are always those of the curators, or triumviri, at the time, and of illustrious persons ancestors of their several families. So many of these names occur, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it is evident the office was annual till after th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> time of Augustus; but whether it continued <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> or not, we have no proof.</P>
<P>The sequence of imperial denarii is the leas<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> interesting of any save the gold. The device<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are almost always repeated, and to more advan∣tage, upon the large and middle brass. A series of this metal may be formed at less ex∣pence than any other, there not being above five emperors who are scarce, Pertinax, Didius Julianus, Pescennius Niger, and the Gordian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Africani.</P>
<P>Gold was first coined at Rome 62 years after the application of the mint to silver. The consular coins, whose number is estimated a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 400 in brass and 1000 in silver, extend not to above 100 in gold, whereof, if we except the beautiful Pompey with his sons on the reverse,
<PB N="123" REF="163"/>and the Brutus with his brother Lucius, com∣monly classed with imperial coins, tho the spirit of these personages should rank them with the consular, few are of much distinction. Some, however, are uncommon, and of high price.</P>
<P>The gold imperial series is by far the least interesting of any, owing to the reverses varying as little from the brass as those of the silver, and there being infinitely fewer of the gold than of the latter metal: there not being above 3000 various coins in gold, while the silver may ex∣tend to 9000.</P>
<P>It is a striking circumstance, with regard to the Roman coins, to remark how much they are spread thro all parts of the empire, even to the most remote corners. The number found in all the countries where the Roman arms penetrated is amazing. It was, no doubt, a cus∣tom with that people, in every instance ardently desirous of fame, to bury parcels of their coin, as a monument of their having, as it were, taken possession of the ground. Passing, as without certain foundation, the account of a brass medal of Augustus being found in the gold mines at Brasil, and sent by the arch∣bishop of that province to the Pope<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Maurinus Siculus.</NOTE>; we know that Roman coins have been found in the Orkneys, where we should not other∣wise
<PB N="124" REF="164"/>have known that any Roman had been; tho it is possible that some barbaric pirate brought them there from a robbery. Roman coins have likewise been found in numbers in other the most remote parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa, at that time discovered. For the quantity found in the central provinces, the want of banks for money, which obliged indi∣viduals to bury their cash for security, and other circumstances of the Roman polity, not ne∣cessary here to dilate, must alone account.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XVII.</HI> Medals of other ancient Nations.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING treated, at such length as the design will permit, of the coins of the two principal languages of antiquity, it remains to mention those of the others. This shall be done with much brevity, as such coins are un∣important, and of little or no worth.</P>
<P>It may be premised, that, by ANCIENT coins, all preceding the ninth century, or age of Charlemagne, are meant: and by MODERN, all posterior to that period.</P>
<P>Taking the subjects of this section in a kind of chronological order, the first place will be due to the remote coins of Persia, with the bust of a king upon one side, and an archer, most commonly, upon the other. The ancient joke
<PB N="126" REF="166"/>upon Agesilaus is well known, who was force<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to retire from the Persian dominions by the bri∣bery used by the barbaric king to instigate the enemies of Sparta; namely, that he was de∣feated by the <HI>archers</HI> of Persia. Some of these coins are found in gold, which are evidently the ancient <HI>darics,</HI> so called from <HI>Darius</HI> king of Persia; as the Greek Philippi and our Jaco∣buses, being unites of James I.; formerly so called. Several of them have legends in un∣known characters, certainly ancient Persian. The present or late Bishop of Bagdad had a nu∣merous collection of these pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Voyage to the East Indies in 1759. London, 1773. 4to.</NOTE>; and perhaps, were many of them published, an alphabet and explanation of the language might follow. The busts of them bear perfect similarity, in point of dress, to the Kings whose figures appear on the ruins of Persepolis; and a near resemblance to the Arsacidae, whose coins we have, in∣scribed with Greek legends.</P>
<P>The Hebrew shekels, which are of silver, and about the value of the Greek tetradrachm; and brass coins, with Samaritan characters; would have been named first, were not all of them later than the Christian aera, and most of them the fabrications of modern Jews. At any rate, the same impression of a sprig on one side, and a vase upon the other, runs thro all the coins of that barbarous nation; and the ad∣mission
<PB N="127" REF="167"/>of but one of them is rightly esteemed to be almost a disgrace to a cabinet.</P>
<P>The ancient Arabian coins appear in the singular shape of a fish-hook. Such as I have seen are of silver, and the more modern have Arabic inscriptions.</P>
<P>The Punic coins, and the Etruscan, ought perhaps, in point of time, to precede the Ara∣bic. The former are ascribed to Phoenicea, and to Carthage; but Punic characters fre∣quently occur on Sicilian coins of cities; on those of the elder Juba king of Mauritania; and others. No probable alphabet, or interpre∣tation, has yet been given of this language, tho attempts have been made, and a whole scene of Plautus in that tongue exists to conduct re∣searches. The Etruscan character nearly re∣sembles the Punic; and exists upon coins struck by the cities, it is thought, engaged in the grand foederal war against Rome<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">About 112 years before the Christian period.</NOTE>. Other me∣dals and inscriptions are likewise found with Etruscan characters; but the language remains unknown<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dutens seems to have given the best idea of it in his <HI>Me∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>illes Greques et Phaeniciennes,</HI> London, 1775, 4to.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nearly allied to the Punic are those coins not uncommonly found in Spain, and by the Spa∣nish writers termed <HI>medallas desconocidas,</HI> "un∣known medals." Some of them, it is likely,
<PB N="128" REF="168"/>were struck by the Carthaginian colonies i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spain; and others by the early Spanish king and petty princes. Many of them have been published so long ago as the middle of the last century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Musco de las Medallas desconocidas Espanolas, par Don Vinc. Juan Delastonola. Huesca, 1645, 4to.</NOTE>; and some Spanish writers have at tempted to explain them without success.</P>
<P>The Runic is another unknown language which occurs on a very few of the earliest northern coins; and a treatise<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nicolai Kede<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i Runae in Nummis vetustis, seu De Nummis Runicis Commentarii. Lipsiae, 1704, 4to.</NOTE> has likewise been written on them with the usual prosperity of those who would offer explanations without any principles.</P>
<P>Such are the chief, if not the only, coins of antiquity which occur with unknown legends and barbaric characters. But there are a few medals with Roman legends which fall into this section: for it must be observed, that, tho all coins with Greek legends are indiscrimi∣nately termed Grecian, many with Roman cha∣racters by no means rank with the Roman. This is owing to the Roman character having, since the days of Rome, spread all over Europe, and continued in universal and constant use with most nations; so that the absurdity which would spring from classing even the ancient coins of other kingdoms as Roman, because
<PB N="129" REF="169"/>their legends are in Roman characters, is appa∣rent, and must start to every eye.</P>
<P>The British stand in the very first rank of an∣cient national medals impressed with Roman characters. Most of them yet sound have CVNO upon one side, with an ear of wheat, a horse, a kind of head of Janus, or some such symbol; and often CAMV, thought the initials of Came∣lodunum, called by Ptolemy Camudolanum, upon the other side, with a boar and tree, or variety of other badges. They have likewise frequently the word TASCIA upon them, not hitherto explained, tho commonly thought the name of the Moneyer. They are mostly found in copper; but some in gold, silver, and elec∣trum, or a mixture of the two last. A very few have VER on the reverse, thought to mean Verulamium; and other legends and inscrip∣tions. The British Museum has a very fine collection, formerly the property of Sir Robert Cotton.</P>
<P>Coins of the early potentates of Gaul and Germany are likewise found with Roman le∣gends: and the reader will perceive that all the kings of France down to Charlemagne range in this division.</P>
<P>Liuva I. and the other kings of the West Goths in Spain, likewise appear upon their coins encircled with Roman characters. Liuva I.
<PB N="130" REF="170"/>began his reign in the 567th year of our aera; so that two hundred years, and upwards, of the Spanish monarchy, fall into the period assigned to the coins treated of in this section.</P>
<P>Different other Gothic kings, who reigned in Italy and other countries, after the fall of the Roman empire of the west, likewise use the Roman language in their coinage. They most commonly occur on the size of medals termed small brass; and in this way we meet with Athalaric, Theodahat, Witigez, Totila, Ba∣duela, and Theias. Ateula likewise appears, whom many medallists take to be the famous Attila; but, as others doubt of it, and ascribe these coins to a German prince of the name of Ateula, the point remains dubious.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XVIII.</HI> Modern Coins and Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE reader must readily have observed, that thro the whole of this work, till now, the terms Coin and Medal have been used as synonymous; and that of Medallion applied to such productions of the mint as were not in∣tended for the currency of money. But now he will please to remark, that, in treating of modern coinage, the word Coin only is used in speaking of common cash; and that of Medal supplies the place of the term Medallion. The word <HI>Medaglione,</HI> from <HI>Medaglia,</HI> signifies, in its original and proper signification, 'a large Me∣dal;' as <HI>Sallone,</HI> from <HI>Salle,</HI> signifies a Salloon, or large Hall.</P>
<PB N="132" REF="172"/>
<P>The term Medallion is very proper in treat∣ing of ancient pieces, because their devices are so various that size alone distinguishes those not meant for cash from the others: but this is not the case with the modern; for such is the stupid gothicism yet predominant over the mo∣dern mint, that uncommon impression, as fre∣quently as size, discerns its solemn from i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common products. Medallion were therefore an improper term if applied generally to the former; and tho it might often be used with fitness in discussing particular pieces of modern coinage, yet medallists, to save nice and un∣necessary distinctions, have universally adopted the more familiar appellation of Medal.</P>
<P>What are meant by MODERN Coins and Me∣dals the foregoing section has explained to be all struck since Charlemagne, or the commence¦ment of the ninth century. It must necessarily strike the reader, therefore, that the theme o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this section is so vast, as to be almost infinite But he must be informed, that it is intended to say little or nothing of the several coinages o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the different modern nations, but merely to give a few general remarks. These coinage are in fact only interesting, saving in a very few instances, to their particular nations. Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which reason it is proposed to display that o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our own country at such length as this sligh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plan will permit, in the next section; leaving
<PB N="133" REF="173"/>the natives of other countries, and those who are generally curious in modern coinage, to peruse the best works which have been written upon the Coins and Medals of each country.</P>
<P>Modern coins, down to the revival of litera∣ture in the beginning of the sixteenth century, are so very rude, that curiosity is the sole induce∣ment to peruse them. Without dates or e∣pochs they can serve not one purpose of utility. The very portraits found on them are so un∣couth, that the human face divine is hardly discernible. The reverses always bear a most beautiful cross garnished with pellets, or a dish of some such exquisite flavour. Yet such is the lust of curiosity, of completing a series, or of self-love indulged in the extreme by posses∣sing a bauble which nobody else does, that ten or twenty guineas are often given for one of these pretty little things.</P>
<P>Such might be the rigid censure of a severe judge upon this subject; but even the most severe judge must allow, that national monu∣ments, however rude, are more interesting to far the greater part of a people, than the most perfect productions of art pertaining to another nation. And this principle is questionless as rational as it is general; for nothing can be more engaging in this way than monuments illustrative of, or in the least relating to, per∣sons,
<PB N="134" REF="174"/>or actions, in the glory whereof the com∣mon passion of national vanity warmly interests our affections. The noble of Edward III. on which he appears in a ship, as asserting the Bri∣tish dominion of the ocean, would, tho uncouth in execution, which it by no means is, justly command our highest regard and attention: and doubtless any patriot, nay, I believe, any Briton, would, even in these days, (what days!) place most justly a higher value upon this coin, than upon the most perfect medal which Gre∣cian skill has produced. The coins of Edward the Black Prince, and others, are alike in∣teresting upon this score, tho indeed the whole English series must be interesting to every one interested in English history.</P>
<P>But even what is here said, as to the interest which particular nations must take in their own coinage, is a sufficient argument for touching very lightly upon that of other countries, in order that all the room possible may be re∣served in this little treatise for the subjects of national predilection. Indeed, if the reader has seen cabinets of coins, or even looked into sale-catalogues, he must know that not even kings, or the most wealthy private collectors, ever think it worth while to form large and complete serieses of coins of other nations than their own. When such foreign coins occur, it is from a late period, or owing to some re∣markable
<PB N="135" REF="175"/>circumstance attending them. So we find medals of Henry IV. in cabinets which possess not another French coin, because of the fame of that prince, and glory of his actions. Such being the case, I am confident that not one of my readers will regret my closing this section with a very few remarks.</P>
<P>Distinct sequences of the coins of some mo∣dern states are easily formed; of others not. Indeed it is matter of wonder that the money of some small states should so much abound, while that of several very wealthy kingdoms is so deficient. To give one example: the opulence of the Moresque kingdoms in Spain is well known; yet very few of their coins are extant. Even Granada, the richest and greatest of these kingdoms, nay the last conquered, presents us but one or two solitary monarchs, from Mahomad Alhamar, the first king, in 1273, to Abo Audili, called Chico, or the Lit∣tle, the last king, from whom the crown was wrested by Ferdinand king of Spain towards the close of the fifteenth century. Yet Gra∣nada was the city in which the wonderful pa∣lace of Alhambra stood, that vast monument of barbaric wealth and art; Granada was the king∣dom graced with the country palace of Alix∣ares upon the river Xenil, so celebrated in co∣temporary writers for its astonishing magnifi∣cence.
<PB N="136" REF="176"/>All its apartments were of surpassing pomp, and the wealth of the king is declare<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the payment of the architect.</P>
<Q><L>El Moro que las labrava</L>
<L>Cien doblas ganava el dia;</L>
<L>Y el dia que no las labra</L>
<L>Otras tantas se perdia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Historia de las Guerras civiles de Granada.</NOTE>.</L></Q>
<P>But, allowing these verses the privilege o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> poetry, the remains of the palace called Alham∣bra, are a sufficient evidence of the state of the arts, and vast opulence of this kingdom<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Swinburne's Travels in Spain.</NOTE>; and these arts, and that opulence, conspire to ren∣der the extreme scarcity of its coinage so unac∣countable. Nor let it be imagined that the Mahometan religion had any effect upon this circumstance, for we have coins of fifty or sixty Arabian caliphs, almost forming a series.</P>
<P>What conduces to render serieses of mo∣dern coins very imperfect, is the great number of petty states and kingdoms, into which all the grand parts of Europe were divided, during the turbulent night of the middle ages. The Saxon heptarchies in England indeed close at the year 801, when Egbert rose sole monarch of this kingdom; exactly at the very period assigned to the commencement of modern coins.
<PB N="137" REF="177"/>Hence the series of modern English coins is more complete than that of any country in the world, not excepting France, tho the latter was a great monarchy, not indeed so wide as at pre∣sent, for four centuries before. For, in the series of English princes, not one reign is want∣ing in the coinage; whereas there are several French kings of whom no coins are found, and hardly any with portraits, till Louis XII.; an imperfection however infinitely more ap∣parent in the sequences of every other country of no very modern name and government.</P>
<P>The first modern MEDALS we know are those by Pisano the painter, and by Bolduci, towards the middle of the fifteenth century. Of Bolduci nothing is known, save that his works are distinguished by the mark <HI>Opus Bolducis.</HI> Pisano was a painter of some merit for the time; whence his medals are inscribed <HI>Opus Pisani pictoris.</HI> Such is that of John Emperor of Constantinople, 1439; and another of Al∣phonso, king of Arragon, 1448; which last oc∣curs in lead, but was doubtless likewise struck in more precious metals. Vasari gives us a ca∣talogue of the medals engraved by Pisano in his lives of the painters. A medal of the council of Florence, held in 1439, is likeways observa∣ble, and is struck in gold.</P>
<P>Paul II. who was created Pope in 1464, is the first Pontiff, who struck medals with his
<PB N="138" REF="178"/>own portrait, as it is believed. We have in∣deed Papal medals from Martin V. 1417, but all those prior to Paul II. were engraved under the pontificate of Alexander VII. 1655, by the care and direction of Abbé Bigot, and at the expence of Cardinal Francisco Barberini. Co∣aeval medals of Paul II. indeed exist, but not of his successors, till Julius II. so that the series properly begins with the latter.</P>
<P>From the pontificate of Julius II. we have many Papal medals of very fine relief and workmanship; to be found indeed on those of Leo X. his successor, in the highest perfec∣tion. The celebrated Cellini tells us, in the very entertaining account of his own life, that he engraved different medals for Clement VII. but I know not if he put his name upon them, or left them in his pride to be known by the superiority of the performance<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a fine silver medal of duke Alexander of Florence by Cellini in the British Museum. It is much in the bold manner of the a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent, without that minute finish observable on most mo∣dern medals, the reverse is a bust of Cosmo II. There is like∣wise a large brass medal of Pisano by himself, PISANVS PICTOR.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The arts now reviving apace, after the commencement of the sixteenth century we find many medals of all the European powers. It is remarkable that, almost as soon as the strik∣ing of medals was again brought into use, they began to be satyric, a quality unknown to the
<PB N="139" REF="179"/>ancient mint. Julius II. having irritated Louis XII. of France, with whom he was at variance, by a satyric medal, that prince retorted by his celebrated one stamped in gold of two sizes, about the bulk of our guinea, and less, in 1512; upon the front of which is the king's bust, with his titles; and upon the reverse the arms of France, by the bye a most improper reverse for the occasion, with this legend PERDAM BABILONIS NOMEN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an account of them, with engravings, in that amusing miscellany of fugitive Literature, the Gentleman's Magazine, 1782.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Of the same kind, but more witty, is the medal of Henry IV. of France, retorting upon the Duke of Savoy. This prince having seized upon Saluzzo. during the time that the French monarchy was rent by civil wars in 1588, struck a coin, upon the reverse of which a cen∣taur appears carrying off a fine woman, with this legend OPPORTVNE. Henry having reconquered Saluzzo in 1603, published another, upon which Hercules appears killing the centaur, with the word OPPORTVNIVS.</P>
<P>Satire indeed forms a chief attribute of mo∣dern medals, insomuch that we may safely say as many exist of this angry kind, as of almost all the others. Wit and humour are indeed qualities which may be looked upon as of mere modern growth, and there can be no
<PB N="140" REF="180"/>harm in their appearing on medals, as well as any where else. Medals were the vehicles of political satire, till the print-shops took up the trade. Had we any ancient satyric pieces of this sort, they would be valued more highly than any other objects of a cabinet. Witness that ancient medal, suspected to be satyric upon Gallienus the emperor, under whom the whole empire was torn to pieces by usurpers. The front bears the emperor's bust GALLIENAE AVG; the reverse a figure of Peace, PAX VBIQVE. Some will have it that there was a Galliena Augusta; and that the engraver, by a mistake, which sometimes occurs, has put her name round the emperor's bust; and perhaps at same time inscribed the name of Gallienus around a dye prepared for her. But the legend of the reverse is so uncommon that I remember it upon no other coin, which induces me to be decidedly of their opinion, who put this piece as satyric. Besides, if it is not meant to be witty, it is only the more so.</P>
<P>Many of the modern medals are superior to any ancient productions of the kind in beauty and high finish; but they commonly yield in strength and relief. The Dutch have perhaps struck the greatest number of medals of any modern nations: and Louis XIV. of France has exceeded all modern princes in this way. But his medals, tho many an Abbé formed the de∣signs,
<PB N="141" REF="181"/>and many a petit-maitre the mottos, and tho they are likeways tolerably well engraved in a few instances, are despised even in France <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self, being indeed contemptible efforts of vain glory. The series of his medals may well be called a chain of lyes; the occasions and events being far most generally falsified and misrepre∣sented: and his blind flatterers converted into matters of praise actions and events of the most just obloquy and scorn, such as the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and innumerable others.</P>
<P>Before I close this section, it will be proper to say something respecting a particular issue of modern mints, called JETTONS, or COUNTERS. These pieces very frequently occur, and are apt to confound the unskilful, who know not what to make of them. They are small, and very thin, pieces, commonly of copper or brass, tho sometimes of silver, and even of gold. The latter precious metals were stamped in different countries, and are stamped in France to this day, for the purpose of being presented, by purses at a time, from trading or other companies, to persons of high condition upon solemn occa∣sions.</P>
<P>The intention of the common counters, as im∣plied by both the English name, and the French Jetton, from <HI>Jetter</HI> to <HI>cast,</HI> whence our phrase <HI>to cast up</HI> accounts, was merely for calculation.
<PB N="142" REF="182"/>This was performed by means of a boan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> marked with parallel lines. The bottom line was the place of units, and the second of tens each superior line multiplying ten-fold in the same manner. The operation, difficult in ap∣pearance, doubtless became very easy by much practice. But, for a proper and clear detail of it, we must refer to Mr. Snelling's useful pamphlet on Counters, commonly bound up with his works on English coins.</P>
<P>These pieces were of most common use in abbeys, and other places where the revenue was complex, and of difficult adjustment. For this reason a great number of them is found in the ruins of our English abbeys, whence they are commonly called Abbey-pieces.</P>
<P>But almost all of them are coined abroad; and that from the fourteenth century down to the present times<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">French jettons exist from Philip VI. 1328.</NOTE>: tho some few have likewise been struck in England, from the time of Henry VIII. downwards.</P>
<P>Most of the gold and silver counters are within the present century, and struck in France. They are so readily known from the arms of the companies on them, and other marks, that it is needless to dwell on them. The English <HI>touch-pieces</HI> may be classed with
<PB N="143" REF="183"/>silver counters: they commonly bear St. Mi∣chael and the Dragon on one side, and a ship on the other; and were designed to be hung round the neck when the king touched the party for the evil: the latest are of James II.</P>
<P>The ancient copper counters are the most ready to impose upon a beginner, who is apt to pay for them as coins, tho they are not worth a penny a piece. For which reason it will be pro∣per to give him some marks to discern them. In Mr. Snelling's treatise he will find plates of them of all ages, whereby he will more surely judge of their devices than by any other method. He will there perceive that the most ancient have crosses with pellets upon both sides, and similar devices; the next, globes surmounted by crosses, &amp;c. and the most modern portraits of princes and dates, with the arms of the kingdoms on the reverse.</P>
<P>They are besides easily distinguished by their thinness, which degrades them from all other coin: for as medals are superior to coin, so counters of all kinds are inferior. The ancient ones can impose upon nobody, for copper was not coined for currency in France, and other countries where they are principally struck, till about 1580; and brass never was common coin of any state in modern times. The modern have almost always a legend in Latin, French,
<PB N="144" REF="184"/>or Flemish, which marks their intention; being so many maxims of justice in accompts; or le∣gends declarative of their use, as for accompt∣ing in the French king's wardrobe, his exche∣quer, or other offices. Those with Dutch, Fle∣mish, or German legends are more apt to de∣ceive, because nobody understands the lan∣guage; but if the reader lays it down as a ge∣neral rule that not a coin with these languages is worth a farthing, he will not be in the wrong.</P>
<P>Some people are so puerile as to allow these baubles a place in a cabinet, while the true judge ranks them with those other counters, of indeed the very same value, which every toy∣man sells to children. But as there is no rule without exceptions, it must be granted that a very few of these pieces, impressed with memo∣rials of events, and the like, are by no means unworthy of notice.</P>
<P>The mention of counters leads me to say a word or two with regard to the <HI>Nummi Brac∣teati</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name is derived from <HI>bractea,</HI> a spangle, or thin bit of metal. Seneca uses <HI>bracteata felicitas</HI> for what we might call <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> happiness,</HI> a false glit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er of felicity.</NOTE>, a species of the early modern coins something between counters and money. They are little thin plates, commonly of silver, stamped with wooden dyes, as would seem,
<PB N="145" REF="185"/>upon one side only, with the rude impression of various figures and inscriptions. Most of them are ecclesiastic, as appears from the cross, &amp;c. and belong to the tenth century. They are commonly found in Germany, and the northern kingdoms of Sweden and Denmark.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XIX.</HI> Coins and Medals of Great Britain, and Ireland.</HEAD>
<P>AS this section may extend to some little length, it shall be divided into five se∣veral Articles. I. Coins of England. II. Eng∣lish medals. III. Coins of Scotland. IV. Scotish medals. V. Coins of Ireland; there being no medals struck in that country.</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE I.</HI> Coins of England.</HEAD>
<P>The coins of the Saxon heptarchies might have been treated in the section intitled <HI>Coins of other ancient nations,</HI> for they are pre∣vious to the period assigned for the appellation of modern. But, to present a regular view of
<PB N="147" REF="187"/>English coinage, it was more proper that they should come in here.</P>
<P>A few coins supposed to be Anglo-saxon, or of Saxon kings in England, have been found in gold. But they are almost universally silver, and of the ancient penny size and weight. A number of insignificant pieces of copper, called Stycas, likewise occur: they are worth about half a farthing, and were only coined in the kingdom of Northumberland towards its termi∣nation.</P>
<P>These Saxon pennies, which have unintelli∣gible, or no, legends, are justly esteemed the most ancient; and such are now termed skeats, from the Saxon Sceatta, the name of a coin, twenty of which at first went to a shilling; but afterwards they were raised to the penny weight, and only five went to the shilling<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clarke's Connexion of the Roman, Saxon, and English coins. London, 1767. 4to.</NOTE>. Mr. Clarke likewise contends that Saxon shillings worth five ancient pennies, about fifteen pence of our money, and Thrimsas of three pennies, were actual, and not ideal, coins; but none such have yet been found.</P>
<P>Saxon pennies appear of many of the hep∣tarchic princes; such as Cuthred and Athelstan of Kent: Eothbert, Sihtric, Anlaff, of Northum∣berland, the two latter likeways kings of Ire∣land:
<PB N="148" REF="188"/>Ethelweard of the West Saxons: Eori<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the East-Angles: Offa of Mercia, and Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> red his queen; with Kenwulf, Wiglaff, Bent<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wulf, Bughred, and Ceolwulf, all kings o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mercia: besides the archbishops Wlfred and Ciulnoth. And pennies of the kings of all Eng∣land are known from Egbert, the first sole mo∣narch.</P>
<P>The series of English pennies extends there∣fore without any failure from Egbert the first king to the present reign; and will, in all pro∣bability, to the end of time. It is already, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we except a gradual diminution of size owing to the encreasing value of silver, the most uni∣form, and, without doubt, the most lengthened, sequence of one species of coins in the world. The Roman denarii extend not, for a certainty, beyond 500 years; but this has already attain∣ed very near 1000. The Reverend Mr. South∣gate, who, to his many virtues, adds the infe∣rior praise of an eminent skill in medals, pos∣sesses, in his chosen cabinet, the most neat and complete series of this kind perhaps to be found. It is true, the pennies of Hardy knu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Richard I, which are of the most extrem<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scarcity, are wanting; but in return several pieces unique, or almost so, are found there <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the best preservation; such as the penny <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="149" REF="189"/>Richard III, the full-faced penny of Henry VIII, in fine silver, and others.</P>
<P>The first English pennies weigh 22½ grains Troy, though one would judge, from our term penny-weight, that they primarily weighed 24 grains, which go to our present weight of that denomination. Towards the close of Ed∣ward III. the penny weighs but 18 grains, and in the reign of Edward IV. it fell to 12, after previously sinking to 15. In Edward the Sixth's time, 1551, the penny was reduced to 8 grains, and after the 43d of Elizabeth to 7 23/31 grains; at which weight it continues to this day. I have been the more particular in this deduction because the penny is the best rule of estimating the other silver coins.</P>
<P>Proceeding with the SILVER coinage of Eng∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following short account of English coinage is chiefly de∣rived from Snelling's Views of English Coin, London, 1763, 4to; and from the Tables of English Coin by Martin Folkes, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> pub∣lished by the Society of Antiquaries, in 1763, 4to.</NOTE>, as the most ancient metal, the next coins in antiquity are the Halfpennies and Farthings, first struck by Edward I. about 1280, for a continuance, though some were formerly struck in Ireland by John. The first were continued down to the Commonwealth, since which time none have been struck in silver; the farthings ceased with Edward VI.</P>
<PB N="150" REF="190"/>
<P>To these succeeds the Groat, from the French <HI>gros,</HI> a <HI>large</HI> piece, which was first issued by Ed∣ward III. in 1354, and continues, tho not in common circulation, to this day. The half-groat, or two-pence, is of the same date and continuance.</P>
<P>Next to the groat is the Testoon, or Shilling, first coined by Henry VII. in 1503. The ap∣pellation of Testoon was from the <HI>teste, tete,</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> head, of the king upon it. The shilling was first, as would seem, a German appellation, <HI>schelling;</HI> coins of which name had been struck at Hamburgh in 1407. The silver coinage now begins to wear its present form, the crown being published by Henry VIII. in silver<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Only one or two silver crowns of Henry VIII. are known they are, it would seem, of his last year, and only pattern pieces.</NOTE>; whereas before it had only appeared in gold; whence the old phrase of <HI>crowns of gold</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crowns of gold were however the largest gold coin in France, and other countries, for a long period, being worth about 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> ster<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing.

Elizabeth, in 1558, coined three-halfpenny and three-farthing pieces, but they were dropt in 1582.</P>
<P>From the 43d of Elizabeth, 1601, the forms, weight, and fineness of English silver remain the same to this hour.</P>
<PB N="151" REF="191"/>
<P>Having thus given a brief view of the Eng∣lish silver coinage, I shall offer a few miscella∣neous observations, ere I proceed to the gold; and shall begin with observing, that the whole coinage of this country, and the silver among the rest, have generally been of the first purity. At two or three particular periods, however, debasements of a short date have taken place. The captivity of Richard I. and the immense ransom paid to the Emperor Henry VI. for his redemption, must have much impoverished the kingdom. The ransom amounted to 100,000 marks, which, at 13<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> a mark, makes 1,600,000 pennies, then the only coin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Some writers say 150,000 marks of Cologn silver, which much enhances the argument.</NOTE>: a vast sum in the currency of those days, and which prevents our wonder at but one or two English pennies of Richard, and none of John, his successor, being to be found; tho a dozen or more of Richard's pennies, struck in France<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The English coins struck in France have, however, no po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>traits, save the pennies of William I, till the reign of Edward III.</NOTE>, are known, and those of John, coined in Ireland, are not so rare. Yet we find not that any degradation, or diminution of the coin took place in consequence of this calamitous event, tho there is no doubt but the public poverty gave rise to much of the happy ferment
<PB N="152" REF="192"/>in John's time; and perhaps we may pronounce that it is to the captivity of Richard that we are indebted for our freedom.</P>
<P>Henry VIII. was the first prince who debased the public money; and it was a debasement in∣deed! for it extended to 91 per cent. All his full-faced money, with a few exceptions, is of this description; and his side-faced, or first coined, is good. The reverse is the case with that of his successor Edward VI. whose side-faced is bad, as first coined, and his full-faced good, being also the last full-face upon English coin. Edward's base coin of 1547 is the very first English money bearing a date. In 1552 the silver coin was restored to the old standard, and ever since the 43d year of Elizabeth, 1601, it has stood at 18 penny-weights alloy in the pound weight.</P>
<P>However, the silver, in William the Third's time, was so prodigiously diminished by clip∣ping, and other infamous arts, that, in 1696, the guinea rose in its value to thirty shillings of such silver currency as then was. The diminu∣tion of the silver had gradually raised the value of the gold from 1688, when the guinea was at 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> till 1696, when at 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> This was principally owing to the common circulation of the old hammered silver coin, very broad and thin, and consequently very liable to clipping and other injuries. By Act of Parliament all
<PB N="153" REF="193"/>the former silver was brought in; and in 1696 that which is called The Grand Recoinage of Silver took place, amounting to upwards of 6,400,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> sterling. For the more expedition country mints were established at Bristol, Ches∣ter, Exeter, Norwich, and York; the pieces there struck have the first letter of these names under the bust of the king; and to this Grand Recoinage it is owing that the silver of Wil∣liam III. is so very common.</P>
<P>At present, however, the silver of this kingdom is very near as bad as before the Grand Recoinage; for the Birmingham artists gain very much by fabricating current coins, even of good silver, our shillings not being worth above nine pence, and the rest in propor∣tion. This calls aloud for parliamentary inter∣position, were not all the powers and uses of parliament, at this dismal period, utterly anni∣hilated by party. When the Duke of North∣umberland went lord lieutenant to Ireland, in 1763, one hundred pounds worth of the present king's shillings were struck; and three other trials have been made at the Tower, the latest 1778: but a silver coinage, tho wanted in the highest degree, seems never yet to have been tho ught of.</P>
<P>The GOLD coinage, as the next in antiquity, must claim our second attention. About 1257 Henry III. formed the design of a gold coinage,
<PB N="154" REF="194"/>and ordered it to be current in the kingdom; but it must have been very confined, as only one specimen of it has reached us, at least the coin is hitherto unique. It is called a gold penny, of about the size of a silver one, and is not of bad execution for the time, as may be judged from a print of it in Snelling's View of the Gold Coin, copied in Folkes's Tables of the last edition.</P>
<P>But it is from Edward III. that the series of gold coinage commences, for no more occurs till 1344, when that prince first struck Florens, supposed to be so called from the best gold then coined at Florence, a state where the fine arts began faintly to dawn. The floren was then worth six shillings, but is now intrinsically worth nineteen, from the increased value of gold, and diminution of silver coins. The half and quarter of the floren were struck at the same time; and it is needless to add that they were of proportional value.</P>
<P>This coin being rather inconvenient, as form∣ing no distinct and articulate portion of larger ideal denominations, in the same year the Noble was made public, of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> value, and conse∣quently forming half a mark, then the most ge∣neral ideal mode of money. It was so termed from the nobility of the metal, being of the finest gold then, or now, used in the world for coinage, and was attended by its half and quar∣ter:
<PB N="155" REF="195"/>the proportion of silver to gold being then 1 to 11. This coin, sometimes called the Rose Noble, from both sides being impaled in an undulating circle, resembling the outline of an expanded rose, together with its half and quarter, continued the only gold coins till the Angels of Henry VI, 1422, stamped with the Angel Michael and the Dragon, and the Ange∣lets, equal to half the Angel, or 3<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 4<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> were substituted in their place. Antiquaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Leake, in his Historical Account of English Money, and others.</NOTE> like∣wise assert, that gold being scarce in Henry the Fifth's time, that prince diminished the noble, retaining its former value; but that Henry VI. restored it to its size, and caused it to pass for 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> under the new name of Ryal. According∣ly, the noble of Henry V. weighs only 107 grains now, while those preceding his reign weigh 118. This speaks gold to have increased in value about 10 per cent. The old noble of Edward III. and Richard II, at 118 grains, passed but for 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR>; but in the 49th year of Henry VI, 1461, the angel was of equal value, tho but 80 grains in weight; which shews gold to have increased in value then no less than 30 per cent. Certain it is that the ryal of 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and the angel of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 8<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> with their divisions of half and quarter, were the sole gold coins till, in 1485,

<P>Henry VIII, in 1527, added to the gold de∣nominations the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">So my authors; but these coins are only equivalent to the half and quarter ryal, known since Henry VI, 1422, and the ap∣pellation of crown seems as old as the time of Henry VII.

The gold crown of Henry VIII. is about the size of our shilling, and the half crown of a sixpence, but thin, as all hammered money was in modern times.</P>
<P>These coins continued, with a few variations, till Charles II. established the present sorts of gold coin; but some remarks upon these varia∣tions, and other matters connected with this point, it will be proper to give.</P>
<P>Edward VI., upon assuming the scepter, found the coin in a state of debasement, to which none, but that frantic tyrant his father, would have dared to reduce it. The gold of
<PB N="157" REF="197"/>his last year being of 20 carats fine and 2 alloy; and the silver of 4 ounces fine and — 8 ounces alloy in the pound of 12 ounces! With much labour the gold coin was in 1551 restored by Edward VI. to its old standard, after one coinage of 22 carats fine, 2 alloy, which was a proportion occasionally admitted into our gold coin after Henry VIII. till a very late period, it is believed the reign of George I.</P>
<P>Till Edward VI. our monarchs appear upon their gold coin at full, or three quarters, length; that prince was the first whose bust only is seen. Silver, which had been to gold for some time as 1 to 4, was again reduced in 1551 to its old proportion of 1 to 11.</P>
<P>Upon the union of the crowns, James I. of England gave the sovereign the name of unite, it being then of 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> value. Of him are like∣wise rose ryals of 30<ABBR><HI>s.,</HI></ABBR> and spur ryals of 15<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; angels of 10<ABBR><HI>s.,</HI></ABBR> and angelets of 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; till his ninth year, when gold was raised in the pro∣portion of 1<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> in 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Silver, which had fallen in its proportion from gold to the degree of 1 to 12, now sunk further as 1 to 13 ½ in weight. The gold crown, and half crown continued to this prince inclusive, and the crown to his suc∣cessor.</P>
<P>The sovereign, which had been likewise commonly termed the broad piece, under the
<PB N="158" REF="198"/>common-wealth assumed the uninvidious name of the twenty shilling piece, which it retained till supplanted by that of the guinea. The common-wealth likewise struck ten shilling and five shilling pieces in gold. Oliver published none but twenty shilling pieces, and very few even of these.</P>

Charles II. likewise issued half-guineas, double guineas, and five guinea pieces, which have been all continued thro every reign to this day; tho the latter two are not in common circulation. George I. published quarter-gui∣neas, an example imitated by his present ma∣jesty; but these last of George III. were found so troublesome, and apt to be lost, that they were stopped within a year or two when re∣ceived at the Bank of England<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is computed that the whole cash of the kingdoms passes thro the Bank of England once in three years.</NOTE>, and thus si∣lently annihilated.

<P>It has already been observed, that in 1688, after the Revolution, partly owing to the bad state of the silver, and partly, no doubt, to the effect of that glorious event upon public cre∣dit, specified in the highest and purest coin, the guinea rose to 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d.,</HI></ABBR> and went on in∣creasing in value till 1696, when it was 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> After the grand re-coinage of 1697, 1698, it fell by degrees till the 25 December, 1717, when it stood as before at 21<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Owing much to the bad state of the silver coin, gold in∣creased in its value; silver, which in Charles the Second's time had fallen to the state of 1 to 14 ½, fell before the great re coinage much lower; and in 1717, when the guinea resumed its former value, silver was fixed in its present proportion to gold, being as 1 to 15 ½ in weight<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In 1733 all the old gold coins, as the unit or jacobus, then of 25<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> the carolus of 23<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> and the broad-piece of 21<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> or 22<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> were called in, and forbid to circulate.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The last coinage, which is that of COPPER, waits our next notice. It is worthy observa∣tion,
<PB N="160" REF="200"/>that, while copper money was in Greece of as ancient a date as the silver, and in Rome two centuries older, yet in almost all the na∣tions of modern Europe it arose a thousand years later. This holds true at least with re∣gard to this country, for the Saxon stycas were of so confined a date, and besides only circu∣lating in the particular county of Northumber∣land, then a petty kingdom, that they by no means deserve to form any exception. The reader will observe, that the modern money is now the subject of our discussion, for the first money coined in ancient Britain seems to have been copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nummo utuntur parvo et aenco. Caesar de Britannis loquen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>: but the Saxons, who gave the first form of our modern money, the penny, for which they were palpably indebted to the Ro∣man denarius, never thought of coining cop∣per, save in the brief instance of the styca. How so common a metal came to escape their use, it were to be wished that some able anti∣quary would enquire; tho indeed the penny, divided by a cross, and commonly cut thro the limbs of the cross into four parts, supplied even farthings, which were adapted to all the pur∣poses of coin; yet the farthing of that day is nearly worth our present penny. But while copper coin continued to be wanting in the
<PB N="161" REF="201"/>English authorised money till the year 1672<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There were two kinds of black-money, the counterfeit in∣tended by forgers to pass for silver; and the authorised money of billon. Black-money, or <HI>billon,</HI> was struck in the mints of the English dominions in France, by command of the kings of England, for the use of their French subjects; but black-money and copper money are very different. Money of <HI>billon</HI> was com∣mon in all France from about the year 1200. <HI>Hardies,</HI> being authorised black-money, of Edward the Black Prince, are likewise found.</NOTE>, with a few small exceptions after the time of Elizabeth, we need not much wonder that, in more remote periods, its deficiency was not at all felt.</P>
<P>The known aversion of that illustrious queen, and of the nation in general, to a copper coin∣age, the last shewn in a particular manner in the instance of the farthing-tokens of James I. presently to be mentioned, has not been ex∣plained by our medallic writers, who, if they explain a legend, think they have done all their duty. It was owing to the counterfeit money, called <HI>black money,</HI> being always of copper mixed or washed with about a fifth part silver. The term of black money evidently arose from contradistinction to <HI>white money,</HI> yet a name for that of pure silver, which it was made to imi∣tate. When it is considered, therefore, that the base money was always of copper, it is no wonder that the idea of a copper coinage should be confounded with that of an imposition of authorised bad money.</P>
<PB N="162" REF="202"/>
<P>Edward VI. was the last prince under whom farthings could possibly be coined of silver, the metal being so increased in its value; and tho it is known from records that he did coin farthings, not one of them is to be found. The smallness indeed even of the silver half-penny, though continued down to the com∣mon-wealth, was of extreme inconvenience; for a dozen of them might be in a man's pocket, and yet not be discovered without a good mag∣nifying glass. Hence in Elizabeth's time, there being no state-farthings, some cities, as Bristol, Oxford, and Worcester, struck farthings, which were confined to the use of their respective in habitants, till called in by government in 1594 Besides these cities, near 3000 tradesmen and others coined tokens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Cotton's Posthuma, 1679, 12mo. p. 199.</NOTE>; upon returning which to the issuer, he gave current coin, or value, for them as desired.</P>
<P>In 1594 this practice had got to a great length and government had serious thoughts of a cop∣per coinage; for now, as would appear, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> small copper coin was struck, of about the siz<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a silver two-pence, with the queen's mono¦gram upon one side, and a rose on the other; the running legend of both sides being TH<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PLEDGE OF—A HALF PENNY. Patterns of this occur both in copper, and in silver, but the
<PB N="163" REF="203"/>queen not being able to resign her fixt aversion to copper coinage, the scheme fell to the ground.</P>
<P>It was not revived till the succeding reign, when, upon the 19th May, 1613, King James's Royal farthing tokens commenced by proclama∣tion. They are mostly of the same size with the above, and have upon one side two scepters in saltier, surmounted with a crown, and the harp upon the other, as would seem with intention that if the English refused them currency, as was justly suspected, they might be ordered to pass in Ireland. For they were not forced upon the people in the light of farthings, or esta∣blished coin, but merely as pledges or tokens, for which government was obliged to give other coin if required. Their legend is the king's common titles running upon each side.</P>
<P>These pieces were by no means favourably received, but continued in a kind of reluctant circulation all this reign, and the beginning of the succeeding. In 1635, Charles I. struck those with the rose instead of the harp. The vast number of counterfeits, and the king's death in 1648, put an utter s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>p to their cur∣rency; and the tokens of towns and tradesmen again took their run, increasing prodig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ously till 1672, when farthings properly so called were first published by government.</P>
<PB N="164" REF="204"/>
<P>These town pieces and tradesmens' tokens, together with them of the time of Elizabeth, are collected by some antiquaries with an avi∣dity truly puerile. For I will venture to say, that their workmanship is always utterly contemp∣tible, and that not one purpose of taste, infor∣mation, or curiosity, can be drawn from them. It need hardly be added that they are re∣commended to the supreme scorn of the reader, who may justly regard the studying or collect∣ing of them, along with the admiration of counters, as beneath any man of common sense. This madness, one of the strangest that ever creeped into the confines of any science, was prophecied in a singular manner by Evelyn in his work on medals; for which reason his words are here laid before the reader. Speak∣ing of the Attic small copper coins, he says, <Q>“Hardly half as large as the tokens, which every tavern and tippling-house in the days of ”late anarchy among us</Q> (he knew not that they were as frequent in the glorious reign of Elizabeth) <Q>presumed to stamp, and utter “for immediate exchange; as they were passa∣ble through the neighbourhood. Which, though seldom reaching further than the next street or two, may haply in after-times come to exercise and busy the learned what they should signify, and fill whole volumes with conjectures, as I am persuaded several as ar∣rant
<PB N="165" REF="205"/>”trifles have done.</Q> Similar tokens are to this day current in Scotland, both of cop∣per and tin, principally issued by the bakers and grocers; farthings not being very common in that country.</P>
<P>Government however had now frequent ideas of improving the copper coinage, for many pattern pieces for farthings occur. So early as 1640 one arises, upon one side of which the legend is FARTHING TOAKENS, and upon the other TYPVS MONETAE ANG. AERIS; thought to be the work of Briot, as resembling his pat∣tern shilling. Tryal farthings of the common-wealth likewise appear with various types and legends: those of Oliver have his bust with different reverses, and one of his bears the sin∣gular date of 1651, if Snelling does not mis∣lead me, when he was not protector till 1653. Of Charles II. many pattern farthings are known ere 1672, when they and half-pence were first made public money: of which the most remarkable is that with the king's bust, CAROLVS A CAROLO, and the reverse of Bri∣tannia as in the present, with QVATVOR MARIA VINDICO. These were first struck in 1665, and most commonly occur in silver; whence the copper are esteemed the most precious. None of them ever were in circulation, tho we meet with a few impressions both in silver and cop∣per, dated 1676, thrown off, I suppose, by the
<PB N="166" REF="206"/>engraver, to oblige his friends. The half-pence of this legend are more common in copper than in silver.</P>
<P>In 1670 current half-pence and farthings first began to be struck at the Tower, but they were not proclaimed till 16th August 1672. They were of pure Swedish copper, and the die were engraved by Roettier. These conti∣nued till the last of Charles II. 1684, when some disputes arising about the copper, latterly had from English mines, tin farthings were coine<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with a stud of copper in the center, and in∣scribed round the edge, as the crown-pieces with NVMMORVM FAMVLVS, 1685, or 1686. Half-pence of the same kind were issued the year after, 1685, and tin continued to be coined til<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1692, to the value of upwards of 65,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 1693 the tin was all called in, and the copper coinage commenced anew.</P>
<P>All the farthings of the following reign o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ann are tryal-pieces, save that of 1714, her last year. They are of the most exquisite work¦manship, exceeding any copper coins of ancien<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or of modern times, and will do honour to th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> engraver, Mr. Croker, to the end of time.

The other far¦things, and the half-pence, are not so valu∣able.</P>
<PB N="167" REF="207"/>
<P>Before this brief account of the copper coin∣age is closed, I must beg leave to make one ob∣servation upon a most material defect in it, which is, that the intrinsic worth of the metal is not one half of its currency. The pound of copper, which in itself is only worth ten pence, yields forty-six half-pence, or twenty-three pence when coined. Hence forgeries even in good metal are of very high profit, and the whole kingdom swarms with counterfeit copper, insomuch that not the fiftieth part of that cur∣rency is legitimate; a disgrace to the annals, and the legislature of any nation! In other countries the pound, at ten pence, only yields the proportion of eighteen pence; but certainly twelve pence out of the pound at ten pence were sufficient. The size of the coin might be doubled without any inconvenience, save to the forgers; and there is an ample field for fame to any patriot whose situation may enable him to contribute to the remedy of so large an evil.</P>
<P>Having concluded this short view of the money of England, before the subject is left, it is proper that some coins should be mentioned, which, being of confined currency, could not well be arranged with the cash of the kingdom. Such indeed are the town pieces, and trades∣mens' tokens above noted; and which would have been first mentioned here, had they not
<PB N="168" REF="208"/>been of such connection with the copper coin∣age, that they could not well be separated. The first that shall be mentioned therefore are what are called the Portcullis coins of Elizabeth, coined in rivalship of the Spanish king, for the service of her East India Company in their set∣tlements abroad. They are of different sizes from the crown downwards, and are easily dis∣tinguished by the Portcullis on the reverse. These may be regarded as the first peculiar go∣vernment money; for the coins of English monarchs, struck in France and Ireland, are not considerable in this view, but circulated thro all their dominions.</P>
<P>To them succeed the various siege-pieces of Charles I. in gold and silver, some of the latter being so large as to be of forty shillings value. A description of these pieces were as endless as unnecessary; and it were likewise needless to dwell upon the Bombay money; upon lord Baltimore's or the other American coin, one of the best of which is the two penny, penny, half-penny, and farthing of George I. marked with a rose, ROSA AMERICANA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was another seheme of Wood, who had the Irish pa∣tent. These coins are all of Bath metal, a mixture of brass and copper.</NOTE>.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE II.</HI> English Medals.</HEAD>
<P>The first English medal known is that of Henry VIII. struck in 1545. It is of gold, larger than a crown piece, and has the king's head full-faced upon the obverse, with three legends within each other of his titles and other matter. The reverse contains two in∣scriptions, declarative of his being the head of the church, &amp;c. the first in Hebrew, the other in Greek. This was imitated in all points by his successor Edward VI. in his coronation me∣dal, being the first we have. There are other medals of Henry VIII. the largest of which in silver is that with his side face upon the front, and titles, and a portcullis on the reverse, with this legend, SECVRITAS ALTERA.</P>
<P>Elizabeth presents us with a good number of medals, one or two of which are tolerable, but the rest very poor, inferior indeed to those of Philip and Mary, two of whom in silver by Trezzo are of high relief, and good execution. The medal of Elizabeth mentioned in the Spec∣tator, as struck upon the defeat of the Ar∣mada, with this device, a fleet scattered by the winds, AFFLAVIT DEVS, ET DISSIPANTVR,
<PB N="170" REF="210"/>is no where to be sound, tho prints of two resembling it may be seen in Evelyn's <HI>Numis∣mata;</HI> one of which being quoted from me∣mory, no doubt occasioned the mistake.</P>
<P>Decent medals appear of James I. and his queen: and a very large one of Charles I. and Henrietta, in 1636, deserves notice from its fine workmanship. The reverse represents Justice and Peace kissing, aukwardly enough; but the execution of the king's bust, and that of his lovely queen, is very masterly. The <HI>tout ensemble</HI> of the piece is however bad, and quite unlike the antique, the standard of per∣section in this way; owing to the field of the medal not being above a line thick, while the relievos are a full half inch in thickness; whereas, in the best and boldest ancient medal∣lions, the edge of the piece is two or three lines thick, where the relief is three or four. A hollowness is indeed given in the ancient to the inner field around the relief, both to give more elevation and boldness, and that the edge may something protect the subjects of the field. As the above is a great deficiency in many mo∣dern medals, it was thought proper to point it out: those with this fault being indeed not me∣dals, but embossed pieces of metal.</P>
<P>To enumerate the many English medals were a vain and unnecessary attempt, nor, after the
<PB N="171" REF="211"/>well-known miracles of Simon, do any remark∣ble occur till the fine gold, silver, and copper ones of Queen Anne appeared. Only two or three different pieces of the first were struck; but, in the other medals of this princess, we have a series of all the great events with which Marlborough illuminated her reign.</P>
<P>About 1740, and for some years before and after, Dassier, a native of Geneva, settling in London, engraved a series of medals of all the English kings with great taste and spirit. They are struck upon fine copper, and amount to thirty-six in number. He likewise gave medals of many illustrious men of this and other nations, all which deserve consider∣able praise.</P>
<P>Those who wish for fuller information of English medals, may have recourse to Mr. Snelling's plates of them; as indeed figures, which bring the objects before the eye, con∣stitute the only plan of studying this branch of my subject, if no opportunity is present for that best of all methods, the perusing of the medals themselves.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE III.</HI> Coins of Scotland.</HEAD>
<P>There is no certainty of any coins being struck in Scotland till the reign of Alexander II. which began in the year 1214. Those ascribed to Alexander I. there is little doubt, belong to the second prince of that name; else many would be found in the long reign of David, who succeeded Alexander I. and tho the short time, which Malcolm IV. David's successor, held the scepter, may excuse the want of his coins, yet William has not this apo∣logy. No coins of David I. Malcolm IV. or William the Lion, are found, which are not ascribed to other princes by the best medallists: those of the last, in particular, belonging to William the Conqueror, only struck in Nor∣mandy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the succeeding abstract of Scotish coin, Ruddiman's pre∣face to Anderson's Diplomata<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et Numismata Scotice, Edinburgi, 1739, folio. and Snelling on Scotish coin, London, 1776, 4to. have been the chief guides. The latter only lived to describe the silver coin; but has plates of the gold and billon.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The series from Alexander II. has not these difficulties to combat, and it is therefore from that king only that we shall date the commence∣ment
<PB N="173" REF="213"/>of Scotish coin. Nor is it any wonder that no money should be struck in that king∣dom till so late a period, when its want of mines, and its distance from any country where silver, the only metal anciently used for coin∣age, is found, are attended to. Not to add that the kingdom, by no means opulent when complete, was divided into different states, till the ninth century, when the Picts were sub∣dued. Soon after that event however the mo∣ney of England seems to have made a gradual progress into Scotland, as would appear from the different English coins of the Saxon and Norman princes there found: and prior to that period all bargains must have been by ex∣change; and indeed long after among the poor, for the English cash was no doubt confined to the higher class.</P>
<P>From the English the people of Scotland de∣rived, and now derive, most of their improve∣ments; and, among others, are surely indebted to them for the example of their coin. The Scotish money indeed continued, as we know from authentic records, the very same with that of England in size and value till the time of David II. 1355, whose vast ransom drained the Scotish coin, and occasioned a diminution of size in the little left. Till this time it had been current in England upon the same foot∣ing
<PB N="174" REF="214"/>with the money of that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See a rescript of Edward III. in Rymer, vol. V. p. 813.</NOTE>, and to preserve this equality we have proof that, upon the diminution of the Scotish silver coin, Ed∣ward III. thought himself obliged in conse¦quence to lessen the English<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rastal, and Rymer. In the reign of David I. the ounce <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> silver was coined into 20 pennies; Robert I. 21 pennies; Robert III. 1393, 32 pennies. Stat. Robert III. C. 22.</NOTE> that the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> might last; a circumstance which would argue that the money of Scotland was frequent in his dominions.</P>
<P>That prince having first struck groats in 1354 Scotland immediately followed the same plan the first being of David II.</P>
<P>After the ransom of David II. the Scotish coin gradually diminishing, in the first year of Robert III. it passed only for half its nominal value in England; and at length, in 1393 Richard II. ordered that it should only go for the weight of the genuine metal in it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stat. 1393. C. 1.</NOTE> To close this point at once, the Scotish money equal in value to the English till 1355, sunk by degrees, reign after reign, owing to succeeding public calamities, and the consequent impo∣verishment of the kingdom, till in 1600 it was only a twelfth part value of English money of
<PB N="175" REF="215"/>the same denomination; and remained at that point till the union of the kingdoms cancelled the Scotish coinage. Having thus briefly dis∣cussed the comparative value of the Scotish mo∣ney with the English, let us proceed to men∣tion the several divisions of it.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with the SILVER: of Alex∣ander II. who reigned till 1249, we have only pennies; but Edward I. of England in 1280, having coined half-pence and farthings, in ad∣dition to the pennies till then the only coin, Alexander III. who succeeded Alexander II. and reigned till 1293, likewise coined half∣pence; a few of which we have, but no far∣things are found. The groat and half-groat in∣troduced by David II. completed the denomi∣nations of silver money till the reign of Mary, when they all cease to be struck in silver: for about her time the price of silver was so in∣creased, that they could no more be coined, ex∣cept in <HI>billon</HI> of four parts copper, and one silver; which had been practised by her prede∣cessors James II. III. IV. and V. and was like∣wise at different times in the monies of her own reign<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reverend Mr. Southgate has a full-faced penny of Mary in billon; which is very scarce.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="176" REF="216"/>
<P>In 1544, the second year of Mary, four marks Scotish were equal to one mark English, that is, Scotish money was a fourth of that of England. About 1550 shillings, or testoons, were first coined, bearing the bust of the queen, and the arms of France and Scotland on the reverse; they, being of the same intrinsic value as those of England, were then worth four shillings; the half-testoons two, Scotish money. Marks of thirteen shillings and four pence Scotish were also struck, worth three shillings and four pence English. During the commo∣tions of this reign, the coinage appears not to have been directed, as anciently, by acts of Par∣liament, but by orders of Privy Council, and oftener, it would seem, by contract and imme∣diate order of the queen. Hence the positive dates of some new kinds cannot be fixt; yet it may safely be presumed that about 1560 crown-pieces of silver, equal to the English, appeared and went for 25<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Scotish, with the half, some∣times called the mark of 12<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 6<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> Scotish, and quarter of 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> 3<ABBR><HI>d,</HI></ABBR> the coin being then as 1 to 5. But it is amazing with what rapidity the coin of Scotland declined in the course of a few years; for in 1565, by act of the Privy Council of that kingdom, the crown, weighing an ounce, went for 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Scotish; and lesser pieces of 20<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> and 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> were struck in proportion; so that the coin was to the English as 1 to 6.
<PB N="177" REF="217"/>These pieces have the marks XXX, XX, X, upon them, to express their value<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Between 1565 and 1567 must have been struck those pieces called Crookstone Dollars, which have Henry and Mary on one side, and a yew tree, DAT GLORIA VIRES, on the reverse, as I am told. They derive their name from Crookstone, an estate of the Lenox family, near Glasgow. I suspect they are only the tommon crowns of Mary and Henry.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the time of James VI, 1571, the mark and half-mark, Scotish, were struck, the former being then worth about 22 pence, and the latter 11 pence, English.</P>
<P>Upon these pieces the motto NEMO ME IMPUNE LAEDET was ordered, but does not appear. In 1578 the famous NEMO ME IMPUNE LACESSET occurs first upon the coin; the same in sense with the other, but of a better sound. Its invention is ascribed to Buchanan; but Father Bouhours gives it to the Jesuit Petra Sancta<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Les Entretiens d'Ariste et d'Eugene. Ent. VI. <HI>Les Devises.</HI> Amst. 1708. p. 400.</NOTE>; tho, from the perfectly similar motto ordered in 1571, and altered 1578, there is no doubt but Bouhours is mistaken, either from misinformation, or the paltry vanity of ascrib∣ing to his order the invention of this celebrated sentence. In 1582, as authorised by the con∣tract entered into between the Earl of Morton, governor of Scotland, and Atkinson, then mint∣master, dated in 1579, forty shillings Scotish,
<PB N="178" REF="218"/>went to the crown of an ounce, thence marked XL.

<P>Thus silver, which in England had been tripled in value since William the Conqueror's time, the pound being then coined into 240 pennies, worth, in ideal money, 20 shillings, but now into 62 shillings, was in Scotland raised to 36 times its first price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Ruddiman strangely misunderstands and misrepresent Le Blanc's meaning, when he tells us that silver is diminishe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 40 times in value in France since the time of Charlemagne Coin in France has gone through as degrading a revolution as in Scotland; a <HI>solidus</HI> of Charlemagne is worth 40 mod<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>sels.</HI></NOTE>.</P>

Wil∣liam and Mary continued the same coins. Of Anne we have only the 10 and the 5, marked under the head with these figures, denoting their value. At the union of the kingdoms all the Scotish coin was called in, and recoined at Edinburgh, with the mark E under the bust, to distinguish it; and since there has been no mint in Scotland.</P>
<P>To close this account of the Scotish silver coin with a few unconnected remarks, it may be first observed, that the money of that coun∣try is equal to the cotemporary English, and often superior in workmanship. This is owing indeed merely to the chance of employing su∣perior artists. The coin of James V. in parti∣cular, is much better executed than that of Henry VIII. The groat of James V, in which he always appears with a side face, is a very good coin; as are the different pieces of Mary, particularly her testoons; but the fine crown of her and Henry Darnley, engraved in Ander∣son, is so very scarce that few have seen it. It is a pity that the portrait of this princess so seldom appears upon her money. The best heads of her are those upon the shillings, 1553, &amp;c. and gold coins of equal size, mostly marked 1555, below the bust; which last are supposed
<PB N="180" REF="220"/>to have passed for 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Scotish, being worth 15<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> English of that time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Slender, sharp features, and the nose of an elegant aquiline, distinguish all the coins and genuine paintings of Mary.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>There is a singular defect in the groats of Robert II. who, succeeding David II, there is no alteration but of the name; the head, and every thing else, remaining the same in those of Robert as in them of David. A strange in∣stance of the state of the arts in Scotland at that period! tho, if I mistake not, it is paralleled by the coin of England much later, for there are groats of the first year of Henry VIII. in which there is no alteration from those of his father but in the numeral. The great seals of the five first Jameses have similar absurdity, the portraits being the same, whatever minute al∣terations may be made otherwise.</P>
<P>The GOLD coinage of Scotland will not de∣tain us long. In this, as usual, the English example was imitated. Edward III. having given the first currency in this metal, 1344, about thirty years afterwards Robert II. issued his; for, tho the princes of the middle ages, unhappily, neyer thought of adding numerals, declarative which of the name they were, yet I scruple not, from analogy, to ascribe the first gold coinage to Robert II, and not to Robert
<PB N="181" REF="221"/>III, as others have done. Indeed, it is more probable that this should happen about thirty years after 1344, when gold first appeared in English coinage, than at a longer distance. However, it is needless to insist upon a point of which no proof has hitherto arisen, especially when it is impossible to distinguish the gold coins of the second from those of the third Robert. Certain it is, that no gold was coined prior to the reign of Robert II.</P>
<P>The gold coins of Scotland are not upon the scale of the English, but of much smaller model. They were first called St. Andrews, from the figure of that tutelar saint upon his cross, who appears on them, with the arms of Scotland, a lion in a shield, on the reverse. Mr. Anderson has not given us the names of the gold coins which he delineates, nor indeed are most of them to be learned by any possible research. We know, however, that the Lion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gold coins, which Edward the Black Prince struck in France, were, in like manner, termed Leopards, from that ani∣mal, part of the then English arms, being on the reverse. They weigh half the noble. Le Lion was a French coin of early date. See Le Blanc.</NOTE>was another name for the largest gold coin, from the Scotish arms upon it; and that the chief gold pieces of James V. were the Bonnet-pieces, so called from the particular cap, re∣sembling
<PB N="182" REF="222"/>indeed a Scotish bonnet, in which that king's head appears upon them. These bonnet-pieces are of very fine execution, and almost equal to the ancient coins, that prince being the first who contracted the size of the coin, without diminishing its weight, in imitation of the French; an improvement not adopted by the English for a whole century afterwards, when, under Oliver, Simon contracted the ridi∣culous thinness and extent of the sovereign and broad piece into a shapely twenty shilling piece. The last gold coinage of Scotland is the pi∣stole and half-pistole, coined by William II., in 1701, worth 12<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> and 6<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> Scotish.</P>
<P>It may be safely imagined that the English names of many gold coins were adopted in Scotland, along with the coins themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix, N<SUP>o</SUP> III, for farther illustrations upon the and other point<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relating to Scotish coin.</NOTE>. Little also is known with regard to the gold coinage of Scotland, save that it fell in the same proportion of ideal value with the silver. That great prince James I. of Scotland ordered both the gold and silver money to be put upon a par with that of England; but after his reign, which was, unhappily, not of long dura∣tion, they rushed down with more velocity, like a stream which breaks a bank set against its winter force.</P>
<PB N="183" REF="223"/>
<P>The COPPER coinage of Scotland, tho more ancient than that of England, is by no means of so early a date as some writers would make it. Copper was not coined in France till the time of Henry III. about 1580; and I doubt much if it was lawful coin in any modern state till the middle of that century. Certain it is, that the Scotish had the idea no where but from the French; and I am convinced that the notion of a copper coinage was brought over from France, soon after its appearance in that kingdom.</P>
<P>In Dr. Hunter's noble collection there is a coin ranked with copper, and attributed to James II. to whom it may indeed belong, tho I take it to be of James III.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It has a bust on one side, IACOBVS DEI GRATIA; re∣verse, a cross, with fleurs de luce and crowns, alternate, REX SCOTORVM. There is another of Mary, quite similar; both have the full-face. Groats of James V. appear there of this kind also.</NOTE> Whoever it is of, it is <HI>black-money,</HI> and not copper coinage, and is of a size meant to pass for a half-groat. Historians mention that one of the chief crimes imputed to James III. was his coining of <HI>black-money;</HI> and the copper, as it is called, attri∣buted to James II, III, IV, and V, is all of this description. Buchanan speaks confusedly of copper coined in Scotland before James III.; but he either means <HI>black-money,</HI> or was mis∣informed;
<PB N="184" REF="224"/>for in coinage he was never versant, and therefore easily misled. Mr. Ruddiman, upon the subject of the copper coinage of Scot∣land, had certainly a design to excite our risibi∣lity, when he tells us, gravely, that money of this metal may have been very ancient in Scot∣land, but the specimens now totally destroy∣ed, by lying so long in the ground. He ought to have known that rust preserves, and does not destroy, copper; and that Roman copper coins, far more ancient than any Scotish could possibly have been, are yet often found, in perfect pre∣servation, to this day, even in the corroding soil of Scotland, which he would paint as being as inimical to antiquities as that of Ireland is to vermin.</P>
<P>All the Scotish copper coin, down to James VI. may be safely regarded as <HI>black-money,</HI> being of the size of groats, half groats, and pennies, and intended to go as such. The ex∣ample of Henry VIII. of England had a bad effect upon most of the money of Europe for some years after 1544, when he began so much to debase the English coin. Hence more of the money of Mary is bad, than of her predecessor James V. The reader must beware of arrang∣ing, as copper coin of Mary, the very common <HI>billon</HI> pieces, of about the size of a bodle, with a thistle crowned upon the front, and M. R. at the sides, MARIA D. G. REGINA SCOTORVM;
<PB N="185" REF="225"/>and upon the reverse two scepters, crossed, with a fleur de luce in the center, and a flouret of five leaves upon each side, OPPIDVM EDINBVRGI. They are copper it is true, but were all washed with silver, tho from some the silver has quite disappeared; and they seem to have been hastily struck towards the end of her tumultu∣ous reign, and to have passed for six pennies Scotish, when the coin was as 1 to 6.</P>
<P>During the reign of James VI. the copper coinage begun; and speedily increased in its species. The penny, like the billon penny of Mary, has upon one side I. R. under a crown, IACOBVS D. G. R. SCO.; the reverse, a lion rampant, VILLA EDINBVRG. The coin declining fast in size, and, in 1601, be∣ing to the English as 1 to 12, and at its lowest value, unexpectedly the Scotish money assumed nearly the French shape. For the <HI>bodle,</HI> equal in size to the <HI>liard,</HI> and worth two pennies Scotish, was struck, and so called from Bothwell, the mint-master at the time. The <HI>billon</HI> coin, worth six pennies Scotish, and called <HI>bas-piece,</HI> from the first questionable shape in which it appeared, being of what the French call <HI>bas-billon,</HI> or the worst kind of billon, was now struck in copper, and termed, by the Scotish pronunciation, <HI>baw-bee.</HI> This corre∣sponded in value to the French <HI>sol,</HI> and Eng∣lish halfpenny; and the penny Scotish, now
<PB N="186" REF="226"/>equal to the French <HI>denier,</HI> was but the twelfth part of an English penny, the sixth part of the baw-bee, and the half of the bodle. The <HI>at∣kinsons</HI> of James VI. I take to have been only the baw-bees, coined about 1582, when the money was to the English as 1 to 8; but upon its falling to as 1 to 12, a third was added to their value of consequence, and they went for eight pennies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fynes Morison, in his Itinerary, printed 1617, tells us of other coins called placks, of 4 pennies Scotish, and hard-head; of 1<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> ½. The first is a familiar term of an ideal low coin in Scotland to this day, as I am told; but its existence as a real coin is dubicus: the last, if ever struck, must have been in imi∣tation of the 1<ABBR><HI>d.</HI></ABBR> ½ silver piece of Elizabeth. But I am positive that Morison's fugitive intelligence misled him, and that the hard-head is really the French <HI>hardie,</HI> Scotified. <HI>Hardies</HI> were black-money, struck in Guienne, and equal, in all points, to the <HI>liards</HI> struck in Dauphiny, tho the last term obtained the prefer∣ence, and remains to this day. An ordinance of Louis XI mentions their both having been current time out of mind; and the <HI>hardie</HI> is supposed to be so called from Philip le Hard<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under whom they were first struck, and who began to reign in 1270.

<P>This coinage continued the same thro the reigns of Charles I. and II. Scotish copper coins of the former are, however, the scarcest of any.

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE IV.</HI> Scotish Medals.</HEAD>
<P>To enumerate all the medals struck in Scot∣land were no difficult task; but only one or two of the principal, and most remarkable, are meant to be noticed here. The greater part, as may be seen in the latter plates of Anderson's <HI>Numismata et Diplomata Scotioe,</HI> consists of those struck in oval forms by Mary, containing a va∣riety of devices upon the reverses, that princess being fond of these symbols, which the fre∣quent tournaments rendered at that time, and a whole century afterwards, a favourite study of the French court, where she received her edu∣cation. These medals are very uncommon, especially in this country, so much so indeed, that, not having seen any of them, I can say nothing of their execution.</P>
<P>It is worthy remark, that a Scotish medal of James IV, necessarily struck before 1513, when he was killed at Flodden, should be the very first British medal known, for it precedes that of Henry VIII. of England 32 years. I have never seen that piece, which must indeed be almost unique, nor had Anderson seen it, for Ruddiman gives it in his Prefatory Dissertation
<PB N="189" REF="229"/>from Evelyn's work on Medals<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numismata, p. 88.</NOTE>, where the original print is to be found. The whole ap∣pearance, characters, and every thing, are so resembling the coins of that prince, that not the smallest doubt of its coaeval authenticity can exist. The front contains a very fine por∣trait of James IV. in the collar of the order of St. Michael, IACOBVS IIII. DEI GRATIA REX SCOTORVM. The reverse presents a Doric pillar (fit emblem of the unadorned strength of Scot∣land), with a bust of a kind of Janus, bearing two young laurelled heads, evidently both in∣tended as portraits likewise of the king. This pillar stands upon a small hill, beyond which is a view of the sea, and land on either side, with this legend, VTRVMQVE. The two lands seen are evidently those of France and England; and the whole device declares his prudent in∣tention to have a watchful eye upon both. Mr. Evelyn thinks this remarkable medal was struck in 1513, when James was preparing his force against England; but I see no possible reason for this conjecture: and as there is no date on the piece, it will fit any year of his reign, from 1498 to 1513. Indeed there will be no improbability in supposing it even prior to the papal ones of Julius II, about 1510; for if a king of Arragon had a medal struck in
<PB N="190" REF="230"/>1448, why may not a king of Scotland, not a much more remote province from Italy, the seat of the renewal of this art, have one of 1500?</P>
<P>The next remarkable Scotish medal is that inaugurative of Francis II. of France and Mary of Scotland, tho it is more properly indeed French, being, as would seem, struck upon their coronation as king and queen of that country. It presents busts of Francis and Mary, face to face, with three legends around them, the outermost of which contains their titles, the middle one this singular sentence,
<Q>"Which wonders how the devil it got there:"</Q>
HORA NONA DOMINVS IHS EXPIRAVIT HELLI CLAMANS, a most ominous motto, one would imagine, to a superstitious ear. The innermost legend is only the name of the city of Paris. There are fine French crowns of Francis and Mary, likewise presenting them face to face, with the arms of France and Scotland upon the reverse, as is likewise the case of the medal just mentioned. These crowns are so fine and rare that Dr. Hunter gave ten guineas for the one in his cabinet, which contains as vast and well-chosen a private collection of all sorts of coins and medals as any in the world.</P>
<P>The fine crown of Mary and Henry, 1565, is so rare as to be esteemed a medal of the
<PB N="191" REF="231"/>highest value; indeed it is wanting in the very first cabinets, and there is no doubt but it would bring 40 or 50 guineas in a sale. Henry and Mary appear on it, face to face, with their ti∣tles; and the reverse bears the arms of Scot∣land, with this legend, QVOS DEVS CONIVNXIT BOMO NON SEPARET. It is said that the en∣graver at first placed the king's name before the queen's; but the latter being offended, the piece was altered. If any pattern exists, before the alteration, it were invaluable to the curious collector.</P>
<P>Another remarkable medal of Mary is that which gives her portrait full-faced, and weep∣ing, O GOD GRANT PATIENCE IN THAT I SVFFER VRANG. The reverse has this inscrip∣tion in the center, QVHO CAN COMPARE WITH ME IN GREIF—I DIE AND DAR NOCHT SEIK RELEIF; and this legend around, HOVRT NOT THE (figure of a heart) QVHAIS IOY THOV ART<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There are medals of Lord Loudon, 1634, by Abraham Simon, and of Charles Seton Earl of Dunfermline, 1646, and the Earl of Lauderdale, by Thomas Simon. See the Works of Simon, by Vertue.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The last Scotish medal which shall be men∣tioned is the celebrated coronation medal of Charles I. when he underwent his inauguration at Edinburgh, 18 June, 633. This was exe∣cuted by Briot, an eminent French artist. It
<PB N="192" REF="232"/>was the first piece struck in Britain with a le∣gend on the edge, and was, it is supposed, the only one ever coined of gold found in Scot∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have the impression, in lead, from the dye of a Frenc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> medal of this sort.

Around the edge is, EX AVRO VT IN SCOTIA REPERITVR BRIOT FECIT EDINBVRGI, 1633. This medal is in the style of what the French call <HI>piedforts,</HI> that is, very thick for its size, which is about that of half a crown. The relief is, however, very flat, and the whole workmanship, if compared to Simon's, not highly laudable. The legend of the edge is very well, as the art then stood, and is crenated with small upright strokes, which have a good effect, and which I have ob∣served in no other coin. There must have been very few struck on the Scotish gold; for not above three are known to exist, whereof one is in the Museum. The piece is even very un∣common in silver, in which metal it wants the legend on the edge, which constitutes its chief curiosity and merit. It was evidently in rival∣ship
<PB N="193" REF="233"/>to this that Simon gave his fine medal of Oliver, the reverse of which is an olive-tree, NON DEFICIENT OLIVAE: and, had not Simon exerted his miraculous art so soon after, per∣haps the medal of Briot might have had now a higher reputation, tho it is doubtless, taken altogether, of fine execution for the time.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ARTICLE V.</HI> Irish Coins.</HEAD>
<P>There never being, so far as I know, any medals struck in Ireland, this article is confined to the coins of that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the Irish coins this work is much indebted to Simon's Essay on Irish Coins, Dublin, 1749, 4to.</NOTE>. Indeed the Irish coins themselves are so totally unimportant, consisting entirely of coins of English princes struck in that kingdom, that a very few notices will suffice concerning them. It is true there are various coins with no legends, or with unintelli∣gible ones, found in Ireland, but they, with those found of the same kind in Scotland and the Isle of Man, may with more probability be regarded as Runic, and ascribed to the Danes, invaders of these countries, and often defeated, thence leaving their dead, and the treasures of their

They bear the king's name, SIHTRC REX DVFLI, around his bust, and the reverses present names of moneyers. Dufli is allowed to be Dublin. It is something surprising that Mr. Simon, in his Essay on Irish coins, speaks of Sihtric as a Danish prince who reigned in Ireland<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Kedder, a native of Stockholm, and a sheer antiquary, in 170<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> published <HI>Nummorum in Hibernia, antequam bac Insula, sub Hen∣rico II.

Edgar king of England con∣quered all Ireland, as he asserts himself in the charter of Oswald slaw, dated at Gloces<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er, 964.</NOTE>. Was he ignorant that Sihtric was the Anglo-Saxon king of Northumberland? He seems to shew the like want of knowlege as to Anlaff, ano∣ther king of Northumberland, and to mention his Irish coin as of a monarch who reigned in Ireland only. This was certainly owing to his wish of giving Ireland one native and peculiar
<PB N="195" REF="235"/>coin at least; for he allows the coins of Ethel∣red, 866; Edred, 948; and Edgar, 959; to belong to English princes of those names: as indeed, when all England obeyed one monarch in Egbert, Dublin, and that part of Ireland formerly in possession of the kings of North-umberland, of course fell into the hands of Eg∣bert and his successors. Ireland, which was totally conquered, in Henry the Second's time, by Robert Fitz-Stephen and Richard Strong∣bow earl of Pembroke, with 1630 men only, seems to have been regarded by the former English monarchs as a possession not worth holding after Ethelred II. 979, commenced the struggles with the Danes by the inhuman and imprudent massacre of all those to be found in England. The succeeding Danish invasions called for all the sorce which the English mo∣narchs could muster, and there is little doubt but that during them the English garrison was withdrawn from Ireland to strengthen their own country; and the English dominion in Ireland was thus silently resigned. The numerous petty monarchs conquered by the generals of Henry II. evince Ireland to have been, after the retreat of the English a century or two before, the seat of numerous Fingalian chiefs, neither in possession of silver or artists to coin it. In∣deed those chiefs, or kings, or patriarchs, or
<PB N="196" REF="236"/>what you will, of whom a score could be sub∣dued by 1630 men, must have been poor and weak indeed: and to look for their coinage were to look for that of the old chiefs of high∣land clans.</P>
<P>In 1172 Henry II. was Lord of Ireland, for to take the name of king over such a country would have been deemed a profanation of that august title; and this addition of Lord of Ire∣land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The sovereignty of Ireland was thus thought much inferior that of Aquitain, a province of France. From the latter the titl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Duke was derived; from the former only a Baron's style. Se<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the coins of Edward III. This style continued to 1541!</NOTE>continued for many centuries aftewards. King of Ireland was a style then despised by the English monarchs, but that country is now one of the brightest jewels in their crown, and the title worthy of a rank with that first in the world, King of Great Britain. None of the Irish coins of Henry II. are yet found: the first are of John his successor. The Irish coins from John to Henry V. are known by the tri∣angle enclosing the king's head: after Henry V. they are distinguished by the names of Irish cities where they were struck. It may be sup∣posed, indeed, that no Irish money was coined by Henry II. The triangle, which appears in that of John, is considered by some antiquaries as alluding to the triangular shape of the harp<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="197" REF="237"/>the badge of Ireland. But it is merely a mark of distinction, and appears on coins of other countries about that period. The harp is never seen upon Irish coin till the reign of Henry VIII.; and it will be difficult to carry the anti∣quity of that badge much higher.</P>
<P>The Irish coin being the same in all respects with the other money struck by the kings of England, it is perfectly needless to take any notice of it till some slight differences arise. These begin in 1601, when copper pennies and half-pence were coined for Ireland by Eliza∣beth, tho she would not listen to a copper coinage in England. These circulated in Ire∣land when James I. published his copper far∣thing-tokens; and the last are of two sizes, in order that if they failed in England they might be sent to Ireland as pennies and half-pence. In 1635 a mint was established in Dublin by Charles I.; but the Irish massacre, and the un∣happy disturbances which followed, put a stop to it, and that plan has never since been re∣sumed. After that massacre, 1641, the papists struck what are called St. Patrick's half-pence and farthings, known by the legends FLOREAT REX; reverse ECCE GREX; and the farthing QVIESCAT PLEBS. In Cromwell's time copper tokens were struck by towns and tradesmen, as in England. In 1680 half-pence and farthings were given by authority with the harp and date.</P>
<PB N="198" REF="238"/>
<P>James II. arriving in Ireland from France in 1689, to make a struggle for his lost domi∣nions, he instituted a mint, and on the 18th June issued shillings; and half-crowns on the 27th of the same month. These coins are struck of all the refuse metal which could be got: some brass guns especially were em∣ployed, whence the coinage is generally called gun-money. The half-crowns gradually dimi∣nished in size, as the metal became scarce, from June 1689 to July 1690: and the month of their mintage being always upon them, this decrease is easily marked. Pennies and half∣pennies of lead mixed with tin, and crowns of white metal, were published in March 1690: and other crowns of gun-metal 15 June 1690, of the size of half-crowns, and known by having no month marked on them, as the half-crowns have. The crowns of white metal, which are very scarce, have James on horse∣back, with titles no longer his; and on the re∣verse the arms, CHRISTO VICIORE TRIVMPHO, with this legend on the rim, MELIORIS TESSERA FATI ANNO RTGNI SEXTO. James, however, having totally mistaken Christ's meaning in the legend of his crown pieces, and being com∣pletely defeated, left Ireland in July 1690; but a few half-pence were struck in Limerick by his adherents, 1691, called <HI>Hibernias,</HI> from the reverse.</P>

<P>In 1722 William Wood, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> acquired from George I. the famous patent which excited such discontent in Ireland. This was for coin∣ing halfpence and farthings; and the loss to Ireland, from the small size allowed to these pieces by the patent itself, was estimated at 60,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>; but Wood caused them to be struck of a far smaller form than the patent bore, so that his gain would have been near 100,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> They are, however, of very fine copper and workmanship; and have the best portrait of George I. perhaps to be any where found. Sir Isaac Newton, then at the head of the mint, said they were superior to the English in every thing but size. In 1737, 10th of George II, Irish halfpence and farthings were again coined of just size and weight, with the harp only on the reverse; and the like are continued to this day. There being no mint in Ireland they are all coined at the Tower, and sent to that king∣dom, whence they return in the course of cir∣culation, and are as common here as the British. In 1760, however, there was a great scarcity of copper coin in Ireland; upon which a society of Irish gentlemen applied for leave, upon proper conditions, to coin halfpence; which being granted, those appeared with a very bad por∣trait of George II. and VOCE POPVLI around it. The bust bears a much greater resemblance to the pretender; but whether this was a piece
<PB N="200" REF="240"/>of waggery in the engraver, or only arose from his ignorance in drawing, must be left in doubt.</P>
<P>Since the abolition of the mint erected by Charles I, which happened about 1640, no gold or silver coins have been struck with the Irish badge, but copper only. The gold and silver money, previous to the above period, is not distinct from that of England, but by the harp upon the reverse after that symbol was adopted by Henry VIII.: and the triangle and names of cities, as mentioned before, upon the more ancient. To make any further relation of it were therefore unnecessary.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XX.</HI> Observations on the Progress of the British Coinage.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE stating some notices upon this interesting subject, it will be proper to examine a little the metals employed in our mint.</P>
<P>To ascertain the purity of gold, a kind of mi∣crometer is used, consisting of 24 degrees, each degree being again divided into quarters. The common estimation of gold by carats is meant, the utmost fineness of that metal being marked at the highest degree, or twenty four carats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Jaucourt, in the Encyclopedic, seems to speak other∣wise; for he tells us that an ounce of gold, at 24 carats fine, has 152 grains fine gold, and 24 grains alloy. Perhaps he speaks of chymice gold. Encyclopedic, Neusch. 1765, art. MONNOYE.—It must, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>owever, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> allowed, that no gold can be made quite so fine as 24 carats, but always wants a quarter of a grain. Fine gold is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and flexible as melting wax, but a very little alloy hardens it.</NOTE>.
<PB N="202" REF="242"/>These whole 24 carats, considered as a weight, form but about the sixth part of an ounce Troy, or that used in goldsmith's work and mintage; but are seldom or never viewed in this light, the carat-weights being always em∣ployed about pearls, precious stones, gold, and such articles of small size and vast price<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The carat-grain is but 10/<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>0 of the grain Troy, the carat being only 3 ⅓ grains Troy. The Venetians have an actual weight of proportion, called a carat, 150 to the ounce Troy, which is the rare of ours. See Harris on Money and Coins.</NOTE>. This division extends over almost all Europe; but in France the carat is sometimes considered as containing 4 grains, and at other times as consisting of 32 divisions, each division being the 8th part of a grain. These divisions are now and then inaccurately marked grains, by ignorant and careless writers; by which means we meet with 23 carats 16 grains, and the like, in some French works. The English gold-smiths have likewise the smaller divisions of 20 mites to the grain, 24 droits to the mite, 20 perits to the droit, and 24 blanks to the perit; but they are seldom or never used in speaking of coinage.</P>
<PB N="203" REF="243"/>
<P>The gold employed in English coin was commonly twenty three carats three grains and a half fine; that is, contained only an 192<ABBR><HI>d</HI></ABBR> part alloy, till Henry VIII. debased it, by de∣grees, even to 20 carats, in his last coinage, of 1546. This was, however, the only coinage of that degree; but in most succeeding reigns, to a very late period, I suppose that of George I, coinages of gold have been given at 22 carats, sometimes with two carats, and at others with only one carat, alloy. Such is called <HI>crown gold,</HI> because the crowns and half-crowns of Henry VIII. were of that standard, as well as all the gold crowns and half-crowns of suc∣ceeding reigns. The gold has now its pristine chastity of twenty-three carats three grains and a half fine, and half a grain, of either silver or copper, alloy. This purity is only rivalled by the coin of Venice, which has the same; the other European gold being inferior, and some of it, as the French louis d'or, not above 21 carats fine.</P>
<P>The estimate of silver is by the pound weight Troy, of 12 ounces, each ounce being 20 penny-weights, as the penny-weight is 24 grains. Our silver coinage is 11 ounces 2 penny-weights fine, with 18 penny-weights of copper alloy; that is, about a 13th part. The admission of so much alloy is owing to the softness of the metal, which is very great; so
<PB N="204" REF="244"/>that, even with this alloy, silver coinage is soon so much worn as to lose all impression. In∣deed the only use of alloy, in genuine coinage, is to harden the fine metal, and to pay the ex∣pences of the mint; not to add the great ex∣pence there is in refining metal to its utmost purity, gold being never found above 22 carats fine, and seldom that.</P>
<P>Of the copper nothing need be said, save that, in the first coinages of that metal, Swedish copper was used; but since so many excellent mines of copper have been found in this island, the English has been employed.</P>
<P>The coinage of England, as always equal, or superior to any modern coinage, in the purity of the metals employed, so has maintained an equal pre-eminence in workmanship, till within a very late period. The use of the hammer in fabricating money being the only method first known, was of very easy management and ex∣pence; and hence the vast number of mints known in almost every city of England during the first reigns after the Conquest, and the num∣ber of moneyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">These names would seem to have been of the engraver of the dye, not of the moneyer, by which name I understand master of the little mint; for the same names appear on English and Scotish money of the same period, and tho the artist might travel about, it is not to be thought that the master did.</NOTE> whose names appear on the early coin, sometimes amounting to a hundred,
<PB N="205" REF="245"/>or near, upon that of one prince. But illustra∣tions upon the early English mints must be left to some diligent antiquary, the subject never having as yet been examined properly, tho of much curiosity.</P>
<P>It is the workmanship of the English coinage which is meant to be the subject of this section. This, like that of all the world, during the middle ages, must be allowed to have small title to praise. In the reign of Edward III, when gold, and a larger size of silver than pen∣nies, were first struck, the coin is very tolerable, and certainly superior to any other money in the world of that period.</P>
<P>A remarkable feature of the modern ham∣mered coin is its thinness, and large size in re∣spect of its value. Hence no relief could well be given to its impression, a fault certainly of choice, and not necessity, for the hammer was the only mode known to the Greek and Roman mints.</P>
<P>Constantine the Ist, or the Great, if you please, is said to have ordered the Roman coin to be struck thin, and consequently with very little relief, in order that the common fraud of covering lead or copper with gold or silver, which we know the thickness of the ancient coin led to, might be prevented. But, in fact, the money got thinner and thinner, by the gradual decline of art, long before and after
<PB N="206" REF="246"/>the time of Constantine; and it was barbarism, and not prevention of fraud, which caused this alteration.</P>
<P>No great improvement can be observed in the English coinage till the introduction of the mill in place of the hammer. The mill used in mintage was invented by Antoine Brucher, in the reign of Henry II. of France; and the first money was struck with it in that kingdom in the year 1553. The use of it continued there till 1585, when, in the fifteenth year of Henry III., it was discontinued, because of its great expence in comparison of the other plan. Nor was it revived till 1645, when, by an edict of Louis XIV, it was established for ever.</P>
<P>Elizabeth, ever zealous of the glory of her kingdom, and desirous of making it, in every respect, equal to any other in Europe, had milled money, struck in England, so early as 1562. Its continuance, however, was not then above ten years<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip Most<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el, a Frenchman, brought the mill over here, in the reign of Elizabeth. He was banged at Tyburn, for forging the coin of the kingdom, in 1569, 17th January. Stow's Annals, p. 662.—Did Elizabeth's milled money cease with him?</NOTE>, and the hammer was again adopted as of far less expence; an example which was soon followed by France, as the after success of the mill in England was the cause of its <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> establishment in that kingdom, in 1645.</P>
<PB N="207" REF="247"/>
<P>Briot, a French artist of considerable merit, after making several unsuccessful attempts to persuade the government of France to adopt again the use of the mill, came to England in 1623. Being favourably received, he struck several coins, chiesly pattern pieces, in this way; but the mill was not in constant and authorized use in the English mint till 1662. It has been just said, that the success of the mill in this country occasioned its re-establishment in France, in 1645; and for this there is the au∣thority of M. de Jaucourt, a well-informed writer: yet it is something doubtful if France did not set the example to us; for it is certain that so little of our coin was milled before 1662, that it is not to be supposed any example of utility could be derived from it. The mill was always, from its invention, used in France for medals and jettons, tho discontinued in common coinage; and it is probable that the taste for medals instilled into Louis XIV, and shewn afterwards in the vast number he struck, was the great cause of the revival of the fine coinage, produced by means of the mill, in preference to the rudeness of the modern ham∣mered money.</P>
<P>Be this as it may, the coinage of England was, soon after the revival of the mill in this kingdom by Briot, carried to a pitch of per∣section which it never had reached; and, in
<PB N="208" REF="248"/>point of workmanship, never will in future attain. The reader will instantly perceive that the miraculous works of Thomas Simon are meant; works which excell, and will ever excell any of the kind, either ancient or modern.</P>
<P>The greater number of medals any person has seen, the more he will be inclined to allow this praise to be just. One of the smallest pieces of Simon, the little oval medal of Oliver, in copper, with the olive tree on the reverse, may be compared with the most finished works of other medallic artists, not excepting the great names of Parise, Karlsteen, Hamerani, Dassier, Urbani, Croker, and Heydlinger. What then shall be said of his large and most elaborate productions? But referring those who wish for fuller information upon this point to Mr. Ver∣tue's Account of Simon's Works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An improved edition of this work has lately been published, with valuable additions, by Mr. Gough.</NOTE>, a few re∣marks only, pertinent to the present subject of the progress of the English coinage, shall be laid before the reader, with regard to the la∣bours of this surprizing artist.</P>
<P>The first coins of Simon are the gold and silver pieces of the Commonwealth, 1648. After he had been brought from Yorkshire, supposed his native county, by Briot, on his
<PB N="209" REF="249"/>return from Scotland in 1633, he had improved surprizingly in a short time; insomuch that, by his master's interest, as would appear, he got a place at the mint not long after, tho he had no opportunity of displaying his talents till the Commonwealth employed him to cut their great seal, and afterwards the dyes of their coin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Simon's first work is the great seal of the Admiralty, 1636, and was of exquisite workmanship, the ship being finished with astonishing minuteness. Briot returning to France in 1646, Simon succeeded as chief engraver at the mint. Cromwell's warrant appoints him sole chief engraver for life, July 1656.

Charles II. made his whole salary 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> He was paid for his works besides.</NOTE>. This work he performed so well, that he was continued in his place of first engraver at the mint.</P>
<P>This Commonwealth money is, however, hammered, and not milled, save the patterns of 1651<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Leake's Account of English Money, 1745, 8vo. 2d edit.—Blondeau arrived from France, by order of the Council of State of the Commonwealth, September 1649. After several struggles with the people of the mint, both gave milled patterns of most silver coins in 1651. The crown and half-crown of Blondeau have a legend on the edge; his shilling and sixpence are grained. The patterns of Ramage, who was employed by the mint, have the shield of England, supported by angels, with the legend, G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ARDED WITH ANGELS. All these patterns are very scarce, but particularly those of Ramage, who only struck <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> patterns in all, while Blondeau took 300. Ramage's half-crown was lately sold for 22<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> Simon was employed by Blondeau, and got at his secrets of the mill and legend on the edge by working under him. In 1652 the people of the mint complaining against Blondeau, as a forger, because he had given patterns of the cur∣rency, without a warrant under the great seal, it is likely th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he returned to France in a fright, for we hear no more of hi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> after this.</NOTE>, and has the grand faults of the for∣mer coin, largeness and thinness. But, under Oliver, the old aukward broad piece begins first to assume the more decent, tho by no means perfect, form of the guinea; and the whole coin gets more solid and compact. The coins engraved by Simon for the Protector are the
<PB N="210" REF="250"/>twenty-shilling piece, whereof the patterns, struck in large as usual, are called fifty-shilling pieces by the ignorant; and the ten-shilling piece. Of the last, however, the dye was only prepared; which coming into the hands of Mr. Folkes, about 1760, he had a few struck from it, which are the only ones in existence. These are the gold; and the silver consists of the crown, half-crown, shilling, and half-shilling. Of these the crowns are very scarce; and the dye having received a flaw below the neck, after a few were struck, those without the line occasioned by this flaw are still of much greater scarcity than the others. But the want of this mark of the flaw is by no means to be esteemed a sign of forgery, as Mr. Leake strangely tells us; as if coins of Simon were to be counter-feited! The half-crown is not so scarce, but of equal beauty: the shilling is the most com∣mon, but very sine. The sixpence, or half-shilling,
<PB N="211" REF="251"/>is the rarest of all; insomuch that not above half a dozen are thought to exist, whereof perhaps four are pattern pieces. In copper the pattern farthings of Oliver are by Simon.</P>
<P>In all these coins the mill is used, and their perfection evinces the merit of that invention; but they are so scarce that an opinion has been entertained that the money of Oliver never was in circulation. Yet many twenty-shilling pieces and shillings of Oliver are seen, so much worn is to have almost lost all impression; which confutes the remark of those who assert that all Oliver's pieces are so finely preserved, that it is evident they never were current cash<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is, in my possession, a forged shilling of Oliver, evi∣dently intended for circulation, and not for the connoisseur; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch affords a strong proof of their abundant currency; one two others have likewise come in my way.</NOTE>. The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en-shilling piece, and the half-shilling, could <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ever be in circulation: of crowns very few ever circulate, because few are struck, and even <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose few are hoarded; and it is likely that not many of the half-crowns were issued. Indeed, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he extreme beauty of the whole set, and the great plenty of the Commonwealth money, will excuse all wonder at the preservation of most of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he pieces.</P>
<P>As, in this illustrious coinage, the mill first <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isplayed its advantages in full splendor, and an
<PB N="212" REF="252"/>article new to our money, and, it is suspected, to that of any other kingdom, the marking a legend on the edge was introduced, it will not be improper to dwell a moment upon these points. The advantages of the mill over the former method are indeed so obvious, upon a bare comparison of the products, that it is al∣most unnecessary to mention that one of the greatest of these advantages consists in the firm and uniform force lent to the dye at once, so much superior to the repeated exertions of the hammer. By this means an impression, infinitely superior, is given; and the most minute strokes are procured from the dye, in all their delicacy, If the reader would see the difference between the mill and the hammer, in point of delicacy, let him compare the frost-work in the shields of the Commonwealth money with that on the coins of Oliver.</P>
<P>It is believed that Simon first introduced the idea of marking the crown and half-crown with a legend on the edge, as an ornament and protection to the coin. Of this art the inventor is unknown; but the first piece, which is yet known to be an instance of it, is a medal of Fer∣dinand Duke of Florence, in 1603. We have seen that Briot gave the first specimen of it in Great Britain upon his Scotish coronation me∣dal, 1633; and Simon now introduced it into the larger coin, with great propriety, as it is
<PB N="213" REF="253"/>both ornamental, and preserves such pieces from being clipped.</P>
<P>The method in which this was performed till 1685, when a better plan succeeded, tho given in the Encyclopedie, is yet conveyed in so short a manner, that, I must confess, it is not intel∣ligible to me; but the original description, with what can be made of it, will be found be∣low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>“Cotte operation se faisoit en mettant le flanc dane unc virse juste, qu'il excedoit de hauteur; et en frappant dessus plusieurs coups de balancier; la matiere s'etendoit, et reçevoit l'em∣preinte ”des lettres qui etoient gravées fur la virole.</Q> Encycl. art. <HI>Monnoye.</HI> That is, literally translated: <Q>This operation “was performed by putting the piece, before it was stamped with the dye, into a ferule of its size, which it however exceeded in height; and in striking it with repeated strokes of the press or mill, the metal extended itself, and received the impression of ”the letters which were engraved on the ferule.</Q> The difficulty lyes in there being no description of this <HI>virole,</HI> or ferule: we are indeed referred to that article, of which all that is the least like the matter runs thus: <Q>VIROLE: petite bande de for, d'argent, “ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d'autre metal, qui sert et entoure le petit bout du manche d'une clesne, serpette, marteau, peson, couteau, &amp;c. qui sert a ”tenir la meche de l'alumele ferme dans le manche.</Q> <Q>A <HI>virole</HI> “is a small fillet of iron, silver, or other metal, which closely surrounds the small end of the handle of knives, ham∣mers, spindles, &amp;c.: and which serves to hold the inserted part ”of the knife firm in its handle.</Q> This is nothing: but such is the Encyclopedic, which, with its eternal references to other ar∣ticles in consequence of its horrible plan, and blunders thence arising, may be safely regarded, if considered as a whole, as a dis∣grace, and not an ornament, to science.</NOTE>The process, since 1685, is by means of a very simple, but not the less ingenious, machine, invented by M. Castaing, and then
<PB N="214" REF="254"/>first introduced into the French mint; but since, it is believed, into all the mints in Eu∣rope; a description of which, taken from the Encyclopedie, shall now be laid before the rea∣der. This process is indeed kept a severe se∣cret at our mint, and the men employed sworn not to reveal it; but as it is openly done at all other mints, and given in so well known a book as the Encyclopedie, and in the English Cyclo∣pedias, there can be no harm in stating it here.</P>
<P>The machine for this purpose consists of two plates of steel, each being in the oblong shape of a flat ruler, of about a line thick. Upon their edge is engraved the legend, half upon one plate, and half upon the other. One of these plates is motionless, and fastened with screws to a plate of copper, which is again se∣cured to a very thick table.</P>
<P>Sometimes little plates which bear the le∣gends are fastened in the inside of the above plates of steel, and at other times the legend is engraved upon the latter themselves; but the former seems the best way, if the legend is often changed.</P>
<P>The other plate of steel is moveable, and is placed parallel to the fixed one, at a distance proper to admit the coin between them. The moveable plate slides upon the plate of copper, to which the other is fastened, by means of a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="215" REF="255"/>pinioned or indented iron wheel moved by a handle, the teeth of this wheel catching an indentation which is upon the upper face of the sliding plate of steel, and so moving it a∣long.</P>
<P>From the prints which accompany the de∣scription, it appears that the small plates, upon which the legend is most commonly engraved, are so cut upon the inscribed edge, that, below the letters in each, and all along that side, runs a small projection of metal, upon which the coin may roll without falling down between them, or touching the copper plate below. When the machine is therefore ready for the insertion of the coin, the two plates with the legend on their edges are even at the ends, and the legend runs so that the first half of it being on the moveable one, for instance, the other half on the fixed plate stands exactly opposite to it.</P>
<P>Thus the piece before it is coined, being placed horizontally between the steel plates, is led on by the motion of that which is move∣able, joined to the letters catching its edges, so that, when it has described a semicircle, both halves of the legend are upon it, and it is en∣tirely marked. When it reaches the end of the legend, and of the steel plates, it falls off, and drops thro a hole in the table into any recepta∣cle which is placed to receive it.</P>
<PB N="216" REF="256"/>
<P>For this description, which I hope is very clear, I am more indebted to the plates than to the account given in the Encyclopedie, which is a very brief, and of consequence a very lame one. We are there told, that by the help of this machine one man may mark 20,000 coins in a day.</P>
<P>To return to the coins of Simon, that won∣derful artist continued in his employment at the mint after the Restoration; but hammered money being again struck after that event, his skill was less visible in the coin, and was chiefly exerted in several fine medals, seals, &amp;c. Yet, when the use of the mill was, in 1662, finally adopted, Simon found himself neglected by Charles II., who had brought over two Flemish artists called Roettiers with him, whom he em∣ployed in the coinage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Others say, the Roettiers were called over in 1662 by the di∣rectors of the mint, as Simon's works proceeded too slowly. The first milled money of 1662 is by the Roettiers.</NOTE>. Simon, in the pride of emulation, produced that exquisite crown piece, commonly called, by way of eminence, his Tryal Piece, which will ever be the wonder of the world. From the RELIEF implored of the king in the petition round the edge, it would seem that Simon's large family encum∣bered him much, for the salary was 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a year<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and he had made considerable sums by his works, for which he was paid besides, so as to
<PB N="217" REF="257"/>be the proprietor of a farm or two. However, even this wonderful piece of workmanship had no effect upon Charles, whose taste and facul∣ties were always besotted with low pleasures. Roettier continued in employment; and of Si∣mon we know little more but that he died, in 1665, as was supposed, of the plague, but, ac∣cording to others, after he retired into his na∣tive county. Supposing him twenty years of age when taken under Briot's care in 1633, he was only fifty-two when he died, leaving behind him the just reputation of being the first artist in this line whom the world had beheld, or could hope to behold. His works might in∣deed have been more perfect, had they more re∣lief; but, for the want of this, his inimitable frost-work atones, by deepening the shades, and thus giving the full effect of high relief. It might more justly be said that, had he confined this frost work to the flesh, for which its softness finely adapts it, and given the hair and gar∣ments in another style, his works would have been perfection itself.</P>
<P>It has ever been the curse of this country that, while it superabounds in men calculated for all the arts and employments, yet, by a singular frenzy, foreigners are always sure to obtain the preference. This must strike every person in the competition of Simon, a superla∣tive native artist, with Roettier, a very middling
<PB N="218" REF="258"/>foreign one. But such has ever been the case; tho in a country equal, as this is, to any in the world for every art, save painting, it is a shame to put foreign artists into those situations, which superior skill and excellence, with other grand considerations, entitle natives alone to fill. In a kingdom where the natives are not equal to the arts, as is the case in Russia just now, fo∣reigners ought to be employed; but, in any other, it is a tacit confession, either of the igno∣rance of its artists, or of the contempt which the government entertains of its own subjects. The madness of this predilection for foreigners, who pick our pockets, and call us a liberal nation, cannot be better demonstrated, than in the his∣tory of our coin. Simon and Croker are the only artists whose works have done honour to the British coinage; and they were both natives of England.</P>
<P>Till the reign of Queen Anne the coinage re∣ceived no improvement, and made no progress. In that reign Mr. Croker was chief engraver at the mint, and to him we are indebted for many excellent medals, and pattern pieces, which rank his name next to that of Simon<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a pity that the works of this great artist, with some ac∣count of him, are not given to the public in the same way with those of Simon. Dyes of medals, &amp;c. engraved by Croker, to the amount of 150, with several of the puncheons, are now in the possession of Mr. Martin, of King Street, Covent Garden.</NOTE>. Of the
<PB N="219" REF="259"/>former the series of Queen Anne's medals, a series equal to the glorious actions which gave subject to them, constitute a grand specimen: of the latter, the celebrated farthings are well known. The pattern farthings with peace in a chariot, PAX MISSA PER ORBEM, and those with Britannia under a porch, are the finest and rarest: the first would however be more perfect did not the traces of the car, injudiciously brought in next the eye, give the appearance of a slaw; whereas in ancient coins, and in the truth of nature, they are utterly invisible in so diminutive a delineation.</P>
<P>The whole coinage of Queen Anne, and part of that of George I. which is of this artist, is en∣titled to praise. It afterwards continued in a to∣lerable condition till the commencement of the present reign, when it fell into the deplorable state in which we now view it. In the first gold coinage of this reign, the face was quite a mo∣del, destitute of all feature and character: and another portrait has been given since 1770, or a year or two before or after, with such gross faults as to make our coinage a matter of laughter. For the head being most sweetly and languishingly screwed about to the left, so that a great part of it should appear, yet, to our astonishment, no head is to be seen; so that the malicious joke of Foote might jump into any one's mouth. Instead of the due proportion of
<PB N="220" REF="260"/>head and hair, we only perceive the face cut off from the head, and a few rude lines scratched where the junction must have been, evidently put there that ladies might not be shocked with the study of anatomy.</P>
<P>Our gold coin can only be rivalled by our copper. The first halfpence present such a face as human creature never wore, jutting out something in the likeness of a macaw. The latter ones are improved a little; and in this our copper coin has a preference over our gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The pattern shilling of 1778 exceeds all our coinage. It is perfection itself—in the <HI>bathos</HI> of art.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The state of coinage in any kingdom is com∣monly a barometer of its power, always of the state of its arts. Hence it is matter of national glory, that the coin be well executed; and the decline of the money is justly esteemed a sure symptom of the decline of the state. Some grey-haired medallists, from this circumstance, foretold the loss of America, and all the cala∣mities which, during this reign, have hastened the decline of Britain. Jesting apart, whatever may be the case with our glory, our coin may rank with that of the lowest times of the Ro∣man empire.</P>
<P>It is not therefore surprizing to hear that a noble Lord has projected a wonderful improve∣ment
<PB N="221" REF="261" MS="y"/>upon our money, and has actually got pattern pieces struck upon this new plan. The intent of this project is, that all our coin shall be in <HI>cameo,</HI> not <HI>intaglio;</HI> cut hollow, not in re∣lief. Were it to take effect, what would be the <HI>nummi bracteati,</HI> or all the efforts of the politer Goths of antiquity, to our currency? May the noble Lord appear upon one of the first hollow coins, in all his glory!</P>
<P>But surely the whole plan of coinage is yet susceptible of real and most important improve∣ments. A far higher relief might be given to the impression, so as to rival the ancient in this grand criterion of good coin<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To give more relief to our coinage would take more time, and employ more artists; but what are a few hundred pounds to a nation when its perpetual glory is interested?</NOTE>; and this relief might with ease be protected by a circle of equal height around the rim of the piece. This circle would not only serve to preserve the coin, but might, in the whole coinage, bear a legend upon the edge; an operation so simple as to appear upon the tin halfpence, when they were in use. This circular legend, now used only upon the crown and half-crown, ought to adorn and protect every coin, from the five-guinea piece down to the farthing; for there cannot be so easy and so effectual a guard against forgery. The legends ought to be
<PB N="222" REF="262"/>placed within the circle, and that on the edge might extend over the whole surface, so as no∣thing could be taken from the coin without ap∣pearance. The copper coinage of 1717, and gold coinage of 1728, are something in the general style of this proposed, but not of suffi∣cient relief, and without the circular legends. Such as they are, however, these coinages ought to be recommended, as of the very best form which has ever yet appeared.</P>
<P>As to the obverse, the decorating a modern prince with a crown of laurel, an ornament never now used, is truly childish; as is the Roman armour, and every circumstance not be∣longing to real life. Want of genius is the only plea an artist can offer for the stupid prac∣tice of following models at the expence of nature.</P>
<P>On the reverse, the poor presentation of the arms of a country may be considered as a proof that Europe wants yet some centuries of eloping from barbarism. Of all possible reverses this must be allowed the most Gothic, and empty of all thought or design. Room for the highest elegance ought to be given upon the reverses of coin, and objects of delight and instruction delineated.</P>
<P>The legends ought always to be in the lan∣guage of the country where the coin is struck; for the money is made for it, and not for so∣reign
<PB N="223" REF="263"/>nations; and every inhabitant ought to be enabled to read the legends of the coin, which is made for him, and every day passes thro his hands. It is surprizing that, when the scripture was given in English, the coin was not likewise translated: but the night of ignorance drops at once; while it is with many a long and arduous struggle that even the dawn of science appears.</P>
<P>Supposing, for the sake of a reverie, an alte∣ration in the British coin upon these principles, the obverse might thro-out, as at present, con∣tain the king's portrait, but without armour, or laurel crown, till he wears them. Around would run the illustrious title, GEORGE III. KING OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND: the other titles, of which the initials cut so auk∣ward a figure upon the reverse of our gold and silver, might be left out of the coin without in∣convenience.</P>
<P>But the reverses, if historical events are not allowed, in imitation of the Roman, should be varied, in every species, something in this way. The guinea might present a figure of Liberty, as the most precious of our possessions, and worthy of the analogy of gold; the legend might be, THE GUARDIAN OF BRITAIN. On the half-guinea, suppose an image of Fortitude, THE GUARDIAN OF LIBERTY. The crown-piece might bear Liberty, Agriculture, and
<PB N="224" REF="264"/>Commerce, UNITED TO BLESS: the half-crown, the king, a peer, and a commoner, emblematic of our happy constitution, with the legend, UNITED TO PROTECT. The shilling might be charged with a ship of war conveying a mer∣chant vessel, WEALTH AND POWER: the six∣pence with an oak in a storm, STRONGER FROM THE TEMPEST. The halfpenny may remain as it is, with regard to the impression, only doubling the size of the coin; the Britannia should hold a trident in her right hand, and let the other recline upon the helm of a ship, in∣stead of holding both aloft, with impertinent articles in each, a posture very Gothic, and un∣known to the ancients. What is the meaning of her long spear? What of her olive branch, with which she sits, like an old lady in a Gothic picture with a flower in her hand? The far∣thing, of the size of the present halfpenny, might present an husbandman sowing, with this legend, BY INDUSTRY SMALL THINGS GROW GREAT.</P>
<P>But any effectual improvement of our coin∣age must be left till GOD help us; together with the more important improvements of the police of London, of our waste lands, and of parliamentary representation.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXI.</HI> Rarity of some ancient and modern Coins.</HEAD>
<P>FROM different causes several coins, ancient and modern, are very seldom to be met with, and in consequence bear high value; such are called Rare Coins. This rarity is considered by medallists as having four or five degrees, beginning with such coins as are nei∣ther rare nor common, and terminating at the superlative degree of unique.</P>
<P>The rarity of ancient medallions, and of modern medals, need not be considered; for such pieces are considered as necessarily rare, and a few exceptions do not injure the general rule.</P>
<PB N="226" REF="266"/>
<P>It must occur that the prime cause of the rarity of coins bearing any particular impression must be owing to the few that were struck with that impression, or their being called in, and issued from the mint in another form. The first is the case with the copper of Otho and gold of Pescennius Niger, the latter with the coinage of Caligula; tho this last is not of sin∣gular rarity, which shews that even the power of the Roman senate could not annihilate an established money, and that the first cause of rarity, arising from the small quantity origi∣nally struck, ought to be regarded as the principal.</P>
<P>In the ancient cities this rarity must have arisen from the poverty, or smallness of the state, and consequent little use of the mint, and deficience of native currency. The scarceness of ancient regal and imperial coins owes its source, principally, to the shortness of the reign, and, in some cases, to no mintage taking place during that reign, as money super-abounded before. From the last cause we all know how rare a shilling of our present king is and may easily assimilate this case to the an∣cient. Shortness of reign indeed does not al∣ways operate; for the coins of Harold II, who reigned but a year, are very common, while those of Richard I, who reigned ten years, are almost unique.</P>
<PB N="227" REF="267"/>
<P>Sometimes coins, formerly esteemed almost singular, will, in later times, lose that rarity, and become much more common. This is owing to the high price given, which tempts many of the holders to bring them to market; but chiefly to hoards being found. The first was the case with the farthings of Queen Ann, some of which, formerly sold at five guineas, would not now bring five shillings; the latter with the coins of Cnute, or Canute, king of England, which were very rare till a large hoard of them was discovered in the Orkneys. Owing to the same cause of parcels being dis∣covered, very many coins, of all denominations, lose their rarity; and perhaps, after the period of dispersion of such parcels, resume it: and some common coins become rare from the very neglect of them.</P>
<P>The coins of Greek cities are all esteemed much more common in copper than in silver, double the number existing in the first metal; those of Greek princes the reverse, with a few exceptions, the silver being superior in number. Of the Grecian civic coins the silver are all rare, save those of Dyrrachium, Massilia, Syra∣cuse, and a few others; the copper, as just said, are rather common.</P>
<P>Of the Greek monarchic coins the tetra∣drachms of the Syrian kings, the Prolemies, the princes of Bithynia and Macedon, except∣ing
<PB N="228" REF="268"/>Alexander the Great, Lysimachus, and Demetrius Poliorcetes, are all rare. Cappa∣docian kings are not found, unless of small size, and are scarce. Of the kings of Numidia and Mauritania, Juba the father is common, the son is scarce, as is the nephew Ptolemy. The kings of Sicily, in large silver, are rare; as are those of Parthia. The Judaean kings are very rare. The kings of Arabia and Commagene only occur in brass, and are scarce; and likewise the kings of Bosphorus, who appear in <HI>electrum,</HI> and a few in brass. Philoterus, king of Pergamus, and the kings of Pontus, save Mithridates the Great, are all rare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chamillard, dans l'Appendix aux Epitres de l'Age d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pacatien.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The gold coins of Philip of Macedon, Alex∣ander the Great, and Lysimachus, are common; the others very rare.</P>
<P>All silver tetradrachms of kings are account∣ed medallions, and bear high price. The smaller silver coins of Greek princes are some of them not uncommon; the scarcest is the didrachm of Alexander the Great.</P>
<P>The Grecian monarchic money of copper may, in most instances, be considered as rare; that of Hiero II. of Sicily is, however, singu∣larly common; as is that of several of the Pto∣lemies. I scruple not to ascribe to Hiero II. all
<PB N="229" REF="269"/>the coins which medallists give to Hiero I. and in return to impute those called of the latter to the former. For, as no other proofs arise on either side, it is much more reasonable to sup∣pose that the coin of Hiero II, who reigned near sixty years, should be common, than that of Hiero I, who reigned but ten years.</P>
<P>To pass to the Roman coins, the consular coins restored by Trajan are the rarest of their class. To dwell on particular instances were endless; so it shall only be observed, in gene∣ral, that the gold consular coins are the most rare, and the silver the most common; except∣ing the coin of Brutus, with a cap of liberty between two daggers, EID. MART. which is scarce, and a few other instances.</P>
<P>Of the Roman imperial coins very little need be said, as a particular estimate of their rarity will be found, at much length, in the Appendix. The reason of the scarcity of Otho in brass, and his not occurring at all on coins struck at Rome of that metal, is, that the se∣nate, as has already been told in a former section, had the power of striking the brass money, and it had never declared for Otho, but waited to see the issue of the contest be∣tween him and Vitellius. The portrait of Otho, upon the brass coins of Egypt and An∣tioch, is very bad; as are those of almost all
<PB N="230" REF="270"/>the Greek imperial coins, in point of likeness. The only genuine bust of Otho is upon his gold and silver money, which last, in particular, is very common<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Of the brass coins of Otho the Greek and Egyptian are all of the middle or small sizes, and have various reverses. Those of Antioch have the legends in Latin, as most of the other imperial Antiochean coins, and never have any reverse but the S C. in a wreath, save in one instance, or two, of the large brass, where they have Greek inscriptions. Latin coins of Otho in brass, which have figures on the reverse, are infallibly false.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In mentioning the rarity of modern coins, I shall confine myself to those of Great Britain and Ireland only; and indeed, as it is proposed to give illustrations upon the English likewise, in the Appendix, little or nothing need be said here. Only, as that account of the rarity of English coins, which is chiefly drawn from Mr. Snelling's Works, and Dr. Gifford's Postscript to Folkes's Tables, will begin at William the Conqueror, it may be proper to say something of preced∣ing reigns. The heptarchic coins are mostly rare, save the stycas, which are very common. Of kings of all England, the money of Alfred, bearing his bust, is rather scarce; his other coin is common. The coins of Hardyknute are very scarce; and it was even denied that they existed, so as to be distinguished from those of Knute; but there are no less than
<PB N="231" REF="271"/>three in the Museum<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The collection in the Museum having been often men∣tioned in this work, as being the most open to the public, it may be proper to give a very short hint of its contents. The Greek and Roman coins in it are neither numerous nor valu∣able: the British are very good. But in modern coins, of this and other countries, it yields to few collections, and in modern medals to none. The medals of private persons are particularly numerous and curious.
<P>The principal part of the cabinet was Sir Hans Sloane's. The British and English coins, and a few others, were chiefly of Sir Robert Cotton's collection, and went with the Cotton Li∣brary. Since the institution of the Museum, Lord Maynard left a number to this repository; and Lord Exeter gave a large set of the <HI>Contorniati;</HI> but, so little does public spirit prevail, that no other additions worth mention have been made. The whole are now under the care of Mr. Planta, who has con∣siderable knowledge of medals, and communicates it with the most obliging liberality.</P>
<P>It were ingratitude in me to mention this great institution, without adding, that its several departments are happily filled by men whose talents, respectable characters, and zeal to oblige, reflect the greatest honour upon science.</P></NOTE>, upon all of which HARHKNVIE is quite legible.</P>
<P>Of kings after the Conquest, no English coins of John are found, but Irish only; and of Richard I. only two English coins are known. Leake made a strange blunder in ascribing coins of different kings, with two faces, and otherwise spoiled in the stamping, to this prince; in which, as usual, he was fol∣lowed by a misled number.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXII.</HI> Counterfeit Medals, and the Arts of distinguishing them from the true.</HEAD>
<P>THE gain upon forging imitations of an∣cient coins being so immense, it is no wonder that this species of imposition has been much cultivated. Restricted by the laws of no country; and far from being considered as a crime, but, on the contrary, regarded as an exertion of masterly skill in their profession, by the most eminent modern artists, this kind of forgery, which arose at the beginning of the sixteenth century, has spread, and continues to spread to an amazing degree.</P>
<P>It were unnecessary here to mention several medals, of which the forgery is so apparent
<PB N="234" REF="274"/>that he must be a novice indeed upon whom they impose. Such are those of Priam BAΣIΛEOΣ ΠPIAMOΥ, with a view of Troy TPOIA, upon the reverse; those of Aeneas Cicero; and Caesar, VENI, VIDI, VICI; with several others of the same stamp. Of this kind is that of the emperor Heraclius likewise, with Greek and Latin sentences, representing tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prince stroking his beard; with a chariot o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the reverse. This last piece imposed upon Scaliger and Lipsius, but would not now im¦pose upon any one; so much has this scienc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> improved.</P>
<P>It is from other artists, and other productions that any danger of deceit arises. And there i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no wonder that even the skilful are misled b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such artists as have used this trade; for among them appear the names of Victor Gambello<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Giovani del Cavino, called THE PADUAN, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his son; Alessandro Bassiano, likewise of Padua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Benvenuto Cellini, Alessandro Greco, Leo Are∣tino, Jacobo da Trezzo, Federigo Bonzagna and Giovani Jacopo, his brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Those preceding this mark are all mentioned by Vico, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wrote in 1548.</NOTE>; Sebastian<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Plumbo, Valerio de Vicenza, Gorlaeus, a Ger∣man, Carteron, of Holland, and others; all, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most of them, of the sixteenth century; and Ca∣vino, THE PADUAN, who is the most famous, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="235" REF="275"/>the beginning of it, if I am not mistaken. The forgeries of Cavino are held in no little esteem, being of wonderful execution. His, and those of Carteron, are the most numerous; many of the other artists here mentioned not having forged above two or three coins. Later forgers were Dervieu of Florence, who confined himself to medallions; and Cogornier, who gave coins of the thirty tyrants in small brass.</P>
<P>The chief part of the forgeries of Greek me∣dals, which have come to my knowledge, are of the first mentioned, and very gross, kind; representing persons who could never appear upon coin, such as Priam, Aeneas, Plato, Alci∣biades, Artemisia, and others. The real Greek coins were very little known, or valued, till the works of Goltzius appeared, which were hap∣pily posterior to the aera of the grand forgers. Why later forgers have seldom thought of counterfeiting them, cannot easily be accounted for, if it is not owing to the masterly workman∣ship of the originals, which sets all imitation at defiance. Forgeries, however, of most ancient coins may be met with, and of the Greek among the rest.</P>
<P>It is in the Roman medals that this imposi∣tion reigns to an amazing degree. But the reader must beware of looking upon all for∣geries in the more precious metals as modern. On the contrary, many pieces are of ancient
<PB N="236" REF="276"/>forgers of the public money; and are often more esteemed than the genuine coins, because plated, or otherwise executed, in a way that no modern forgers could attain to; and of conse∣quence bearing intrinsic marks of antiquity. The ancients themselves held coins ingeniously counterfeited in such high esteem, that P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iny informs us many true denarii were often give<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for one false one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Falsi denarii spectatur exemplar; pluribusque veris denarii<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> adulterinus emitur. Plin. Hist Nat.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Even of the Roman consular coins not very many have ever been forged. The celebrated silver denarius of Brutus with the cap of liberty and two daggers, is the chief instance of a con∣sular coin of which a counterfeit is cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt. But it is easily rejected by this mark: in the true coin the cap of liberty is below the guard, or hilt, of the daggers; in the false the top of it rises above that hilt.</P>
<P>It is in the grandest series in the world, the imperial series of Rome, that modern forgery has almost universal prevalence: and rules for discerning it shall presently be laid down from the essay of M. Beauvais, the latest given on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the subject<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">La maniere de discerner les medailles antiques de celles qu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sont contrefaites, 4to, Paris, 1739. This dissertation was after∣wards added to the treatise on the Finances of the Romans translated into English: but the best edition, here followed, is a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the end of Histoire abregée des Empereurs, &amp;c. par M. Beau∣vais, Paris, 1767, 3 tomes, 12mo. This essay is however very desicient, and a few of its defects are attempted to be supplied. Vico, whom Beauvais copies, but does not mention, is a far su∣petior writer on the point, tho not so general.</NOTE>. It may be premised that the de∣ception
<PB N="237" REF="277"/>of forgery at first extended to the most eminent writers, for William du Choul, who wrote more than two hundred years ago, caused to be engraved in his treatise, On the religion of the ancient Romans, two medals of Agrip∣pa; one of great brass, on the reverse of which is the Pantheon: and another of silver, with Neptune in his car drawn by two sea-horses, with this legend AEQVORIS HIC OMNIPOTENS. Both of these medals were undoubtedly false. Antony Le Pois, who lived at the same time, produces different medals of certain falsity; such as a Scipio Africanus; the Aelian bridge on a reverse of Hadrian; and a Pescennius Ni∣ger of gold; then undiscovered, tho since found, and to be seen in the French king's cabi∣net. These instances must convince us that, almost as soon as a taste for coins began to spread among the curious, the trade of imposi∣tion arose.</P>
<P>Counterfeit medals fall into six classes; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. Medals known to be modern imitations of the ancient; but which being by masters, such as the Paduan, &amp;c. have their value.</P>
<PB N="238" REF="278"/>
<P N="2">2. Medals cast from these modern masterly imitations.</P>
<P N="3">3. Medals cast in molds taken from the an∣tique.</P>
<P N="4">4. Ancient medals which are retouched, and the obverses or reverses altered.</P>
<P N="5">5. Medals which are impressed with new de∣vices, or which are soldered.</P>
<P N="6">6. Counterfeit medals which have clefts, or which are plated.</P>
<P>In treating of these different impositions, I shall do little more than divest M. Beauvais's work on this subject of extraneous matter, and lay the essence of it before my reader in as few words as possible.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>CLASS I.</HI> Medals known to be modern Imitations, but which derive a Value from their masterly Execution.</HEAD>
<P>Among these, as has already been observed, those of the Paduan stand in the first rank for masterly execution. They are so numerous, that a complete series of imperial medals, of almost every metal and size, may be formed of them alone; nay, a numerous collection of me∣dallions themselves. In France, particularly, they so swarm, and so impose upon the un∣knowing, that far the greater part of the coins
<PB N="239" REF="279"/>in country cabinets, upon being brought to Pa∣ris for sale, are found to be of this stamp. A connoisseur however easily distinguishes them by these marks: 1. They are almost univer∣sally thinner than the ancient. 2. They are never worn nor damaged. 3. The letters are forked and modern. 4. They have either no varnish, or it is false, which is easily discerned, for it is black, greasy, and shining<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sometimes a light green coaty-like varnish is given, sported with a kind of iron marks. It is made of sulphur, verdigrease, and vinegar; and is often distinguished, among other marks, by hair strokes of the brush with which it was laid on. Vico is learned upon false rusts, lib. I. C. 22.</NOTE>, besides be∣ing very tender when touched with a needle or burin; while the ancient has none of these qua∣lities, and is hard as the coin itself. 5. The sides are filed, which is discoverable by the least attention; or they are too much smoothed by art, or bear marks of a small hammer. 6. They are always very circular, which the an∣cient are not, especially after Trajan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tho M. Beauvais gives these six marks here, yet some of them more properly refer to the two following classes: a few observations shall therefore be added. 1. The coins and me∣dallions of the Paduan are seldom thinner than the ancient, but those of inferior forgers are almost always. 2. The Paduan forgeries very seldom appear as worn, or damaged, but the others very frequently, especially in the reverse, and legend of the re∣verse, which sometimes, as in many forged Othos, appear as half consumed by time. 3. The letters in coins cast in molds taken from the antique have the very rudeness of antiquity. 4. False varnish is either light green or black, and shines too much or too little. 5. The sides of forged coins are often quite smooth, and undiscernable from the ancient; to smooth them indeed requires little or no art. 6. Counterfeit medals are very often of as irregular a form as the real; tho those of the Pa∣duan are generally circular: false coins have often little sec∣tions cut off, and other perfect imitations of the ancient. One great distinction of cast coins is, that the letters do not go sharp down to the field of the medal, but appear as molting into it; so that they have no fixed outline, and one cannot see to their bottom, so to speak. Add to this, that the minute angles of the letters and drapery, &amp;c. of the figures are commonly filled up in cast coins, and have not the sharpness of the genuine; and where the figures and letters are faint the coin is greatly to be suspected.</NOTE>.</P>
<PB N="240" REF="280"/>
<P>All medallions from Julius Caesar to Hadrian are much to be suspected of this fabrication <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those of the first fourteen emperors, when true, being of vast value, and only to be found in princely cabinets.</P>
<P>Hence it may be observed, once for all, that the letters of the legend form the very surest test of medals, those of modern medals being always modern, while the ancient have many rude peculiarities, such as the M always in this form M, and not with straight strokes; which, with many other little differences, constitutes an infallible distinction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The letters form the grand criterion of medals, the modem being uniform, the ancient very rude.

<HEAD><HI>CLASS II.</HI> Medals cast from the modern by For∣gers, who, wanting genius to engrave dyes, are content to mould them from the <HI>Paduan</HI> and other Masters.</HEAD>
<P>These are sometimes more difficult to dis∣cern than the former, because that, in casting them, they give them what thickness they please; and, filling with mastic the little cavi∣ties which the sand leaves, they retouch the letters with a graving tool, and masque the im∣position with varnish. However, most of the instructions given for the first class likewise avail in this, with another distinction, which is, that coins of this class are always much lighter than true medals of their size, because fire rare∣fies the melted metal, while that which is struck is condensed, and becomes of consequence more weighty.</P>
<P>Those which are cast in gold or silver, either in this way or from the antique, betray them∣selves, as these metals admit no varnished imita∣tion of rust.</P>
<P>The marks of the file on the margin of these form a sure badge of falsity, as in the first class: but it must be observed, that these marks, in gold or in silver coins, by no means declare them modern, when they constitute the sole suspicion; for the ancient Romans often
<PB N="242" REF="282"/>filed coins in these metals, that they might be enchased in rings, around vases, or the like; as we sometimes have quarter-guineas, &amp;c. inserted in the bottom of punch-ladles.</P>
<P>It is a common trick, in this class of counter∣feits especially, to cover a false coin with wax, then pricking it on the margin, to drop aqua fortis into the holes. This destroys the sides of a coin more effectually than if it had been eaten into by time. The amateur must be upon his guard against this fraud, which is not easily distinguishable, and bear it in mind, that a medal eaten into on the sides may yet be mo∣dern, and a filed medal of gold or silver may, notwithstanding this suspicious appearance, boast indubitable antiquity.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>CLASS III.</HI> Medals cast in Moulds from the Antique.</HEAD>
<P>The same distinctions which serve in the for∣mer classes are likewise to be used in this.</P>
<P>M. Beauvais informs us, that skilful work∣men in this way, when about to forge coins of gold or silver, are sometimes so careful, that the quality of their metal shall not betray them, that they will melt a common medal of the very emperor whom they mean to counterfeit, in order to give it the new device of a rare one
<PB N="243" REF="283"/>of the same prince. This has been done in the silver Septimius Severus, with the reverse of a triumphal arch, for which a common coin of the same prince has been melted; and in other instances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Putting medals in the fire, or upon hot iron, to cleanse them, gives them an appearance of being cast; for some spots of the metal, being softer than the rest, will run, which makes this one of the worst plans of cleansing medals.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>CLASS IV.</HI> Ancient Medals retouched and al∣tered.</HEAD>
<P>This is the species of deception which is the most apt to impose even on the skilful; and one must know a good deal of medals not to be the dupe of it. The art exerted in this class is astonishing; and a connoisseur is apt the less to suspect it, as the coins themselves are in fact ancient. The acute minds of the Italian artists exerted themselves in this way, when the other kinds of forgeries became common and known. With graving tools they alter the portraits, the reverses, the inscriptions themselves, in a surprising manner. Of a Claudius, struck at Antioch, they make an Otho: of a Faustina, a Titiana: of a Julia Severi, a Didia Clara: of a Macrinus, a Pescennius: of an Orbiana, an Annia Faustina: of a Mamaea, a Tranquillina:
<PB N="244" REF="284"/>of a Philip, an Emilian. Give them a Marcus Aurelius, he starts up a Pertinax, by thicken∣ing the beard a little, and enlarging the nose. In short, wherever there is the least resem∣blance in persons, reverses, or legends, an ar∣tist of this class can, from a trivial medal, gene∣rate a most scarce and valuable one.</P>
<P>This fraud is distinguishable by the false var∣nish which sometimes masks it; but, above all, by the letters of the legend, which are always altered. Tho this is sometimes done with an artifice almost miraculous, yet most commonly the characters straggle, are disunited, and not in a line.</P>
<P>Medals of this class are often met with of which the obverse has not been touched, but the reverse made hollow, then filled with mas∣tic of the colour of the coin, which is engraved with such device and legend as the artist knew was uncommon, and would bear a great price.</P>
<P>Others are only retouched in some minute particulars, which however very much diminish the value of the coin.</P>
<P>Against all these arts severe scrutiny must be used by the purchaser upon the medal itself and the investigation and opinion of eminent antiquaries had upon its being altered, or ge∣nuine as it issued from the mint.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="245" REF="285"/>
<HEAD><HI>CLASS V.</HI> Medals impressed with new Devices, or soldered.</HEAD>
<P>The first article of this class concerns those medals of which the real reverses have been totally filed off, and new ones impressed by dint of a dye and the hammer. This is done by putting the face or obverse, whichever is not touched, upon different folds of pasteboard, and then applying the dye, and impressing it with strokes of an hammer.</P>
<P>Most of such coins of themselves betray their falsity; the devices and inscriptions being such as are known not to exist upon real medals. Such as the Pons Aelius on the reverse of Ha∣drian; the Expeditio Judaica of the same em∣peror; and the like.</P>
<P>Besides this, another infallible token is the difference, more or less, in the fabrication of the face and of the new reverse. This an eye of any skill will always discern at first glance.</P>
<P><HI>Soldered</HI> medals are those which consist of two halves belonging to different medals that are sawed thro, and then joined with solder. This deceit is common in silver and in brass. They will take an Antoninus, for example, and saw off the reverse, then solder to the obverse a Faustina which they have treated in like
<PB N="246" REF="286"/>manner. This makes a medal which will, from an unknowing purchaser, bring an hundred times the price of the two coins which com∣pose it. When the deceit is used in brass coins, they take care that the two medals be of one hue; tho indeed some pretenders in this way sometimes solder copper and brass together, which at once reveals the disguise.</P>
<P>Medals which have a portrait on each side, and which are always valuable, are the most liable to suspicion of this fraud.</P>
<P>To a very nice eye the minute ring of the solder is always visible; and upon inserting a graver the fabrication falls in halves.</P>
<P>Reverses are likewise often treated in this way, by being soldered to faces not originally connected with them. Pere Jobert tells us of a Domitian, with the Amphitheatre, a reverse of Titus, thus glewed to it: and many others of the like kind arise to this day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The temple of Janus, upon Nero's medals, gives instance <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another art: that of the middle brass being sometimes taken o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and inserted into a cavity made in the reverse of a large bra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coin of that prince.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It may be worth while to observe here, that many reverses in coins of the lower empire are so unconnected with their obverses, that they inspire a mistaken suspicion of this forgery. These occur especially after the days of Gal∣lienus,
<PB N="247" REF="287"/>when numerous usurpers walked over the tragic scene of empire so fast that it was difficult to catch their features. The coiners had scarcely time to engrave a portrait of the emperor, much less to make his medal an ap∣propriated monument of adulation. Hence PACATOR ORBIS on a reverse of Marius, who reigned only three days: and innumerable others, which are owing to the coiners stamp∣ing the medals of these fugitive sovereigns with reverses which they had ready fabricated for some preceding monarch whose reign was at least of sufficient duration to afford time for engraving a reverse.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD><HI>CLASS VI.</HI> Counterfeit Medals which have Clefts, or which are plated.</HEAD>
<P>Many true medals are split on the sides, owing to the ancient method of striking them with repeated strokes of a hammer. As these clefts were regarded as infallible marks of an∣tiquity, those artists who wish to impose on the collector of medals in every shape readily set themselves to imitate them. This they did by filing an incifion upon the margin of the coin as much resembling the casual clefts as possible.</P>
<PB N="248" REF="288"/>
<P>But this flaw is easily distinguishable from the casual by its being wide at the extremity, and going straight in, ending at once in a point, and not with those almost imperceptible fila∣ments which terminate the genuine. Add to this, that the two sides of an antique cleft cor∣respond to each other by mutual chinks and protuberances, which are inimitable by the file, so that the distinction is by no means a task of difficulty. If the filaments of the real clefts are attempied to be imitated, a small needle will easily decide of their depth and reality.</P>
<P>Such medals as are <HI>plated,</HI> and in fact forged in ancient times, were believed to be incapable of modern imitation, and very much trusted to till of late years, when some ingenious rogues thought of piercing false medals of silver with a red-hot needle, which gave a blackness to the inside of the coin, and made it appear plated to an injudicious eye. This fraud is easily dis∣tinguished by scraping the side of the medal.</P>
<P>This section shall be concluded, after ob∣serving, that those rules laid down by M. Beau∣vais, tho very proper, will yet be of little ser∣vice without a real and practical knowledge of coins. This is only to be acquired by seeing a great number, and comparing the forged with the genuine. It cannot therefore be too
<PB N="249" REF="289"/>much recommended to the young connoisseur, who wishes to acquire knowledge in this way, to visit all the sales and cabinets he can, and to look upon all ancient medals with a very mi∣croscopic eye. By these means only is to be acquired that ready knowledge which enables, at first glance, to pronounce upon a forgery, however ingenious. Nor let the science of me∣dals be from this concluded to be uncertain, for no knowledge is more certain and immedi∣ate when it is properly studied by examination of the real objects. A man who buys coins, trusting merely to his theoretic perusal of me∣dallic books, will find himself woefully mis∣taken. He ought to study coins first, where only they can be studied, in themselves. Nor can it be matter of wonder, or implication of caprice, that a medallist of skill should, at one perception, pronounce upon the veracity or falshood of a medal; for the powers of the hu∣man eye, employed in certain lines of science, are amazing. Hence a student can distinguish a book among a thousand similar, and quite alike to every other eye: hence a shepherd can discern and characterize every ram and ewe of his flock, tho they strike every body else as uniformity itself: hence a sailor can know of what country a vessel is at an immense dis∣tance: hence any one knows his friend, tho in
<PB N="250" REF="290"/>a croud at the further end of a street, where any marks of him were unattainable to an in∣different spectator: hence the medallist can in an instant say, "this is a false coin, and this a true," tho to other people no distinction be perceivable.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXIII.</HI> Directions for forming Cabinets.</HEAD>
<P>CABINETS of medals may be divided into three distinct sizes: I. The large and complete cabinet; containing, or meant to contain, every issue of the mint, in every age, and of every country. This, it may easily be seen, requires a vast expence, and few but kings ought to attempt it. The King of France has the most opulent cabinet of this kind in exist∣ence, and which is calculated to have cost, since its institution till now, when arrived at a point of perfection which it can but little ex∣ceed, near 100,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> sterling. That of Dr. Hunter is perhaps one of the best private cabi∣nets ever formed in this style, and is thought
<PB N="252" REF="292"/>to have cost about 15,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>—II. The smaller cabinet; the collector of which, confining him∣self to the forming of five or six sequences, as of middle and small Roman brass only, of English pennies, or of groats, or any other par∣ticular serieses, considers other medals as out of his line of collecting, tho he may purchase a few desolate ones, or belonging to other sets, to give variety to his selection. Such a cabi∣net may infer an expence of from 200<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> or 300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 1000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>—III. The least cabinet, or casket of medals, which may include all little collections of coins, from a hundred to a thousand or two. In this not above a sequence or two can well be formed; but the <HI>amateur</HI> pleases his fancy by the miscellaneous insertion of any article which curiosity, or other motives, may incline him to procure. The expence, of consequence, depends entirely upon the pleasure of the pro∣prietor.</P>
<P>To begin with the large and complete ca∣binet, it is to be observed that, in the grand division of ancient coins, as distinct from the modern, the Greek medals, of every denomina∣tion, can never be arranged by the metals, or sizes, like the Roman; for no series of any one metal, or size, can be found of this class in the most opulent cabinet. For this reason the civic coins, of all metals and sizes, are digested in alphabetical order, and the monarchic in
<PB N="253" REF="293"/>chronological. The same rule is to be ob∣served in the Roman consular medals, which are arranged in alphabetical series of the fami∣lies, like those of the Greek cities. Indeed, of all ancient coins, the Roman imperial series is the only one admitting of being digested in sizes and metals. And even from it must be excepted the <HI>quinarii,</HI> or very smallest coins; which are so scarce that the only sequence of this kind in the world is that belonging to the King of Spain, which was formed by a most skilful French medallist, and consists of all the metals.</P>
<P>Having premised these observations, the pro∣per divisions of a grand and complete cabinet shall next be stated; which, in the part allotted to ancient coins, may run thus:</P>
<P N="1">I. The coins of cities and of free states, in alphabetical order.</P>
<P N="2">II. Kings in chronological series, both as to foundation of empire and seniority of reign.</P>
<P N="3">III. Heroes, heroines, and founders of em∣pires, and of cities.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Other illustrious men and women.</P>
<P N="5">V. Roman <HI>ases.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. Coins of families, commonly called Consular.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Imperial medallions.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Imperial gold.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Imperial <HI>quinarii,</HI> of all metals.</P>
<PB N="254" REF="294"/>
<P N="10">X. Imperial silver.</P>
<P N="11">XI. Imperial first brass.</P>
<P N="12">XII. Second brass.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. Third brass.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. Colonial coins, which are all of brass.</P>
<P N="15">XV. Greek cities under the emperors, of all metals and sizes. In a smaller cabinet they may be put with the Roman, according to their metal and size.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. Egyptian coins struck under the Ro∣man emperors, of all metals and sizes. They are mostly of a base metal, called by the French writers <HI>potin,</HI> being a kind of pot-metal, or brittle brass<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is composed of copper, lead, and tin, with sometimes a fifth, and oftener a tenth, or twelfth part silver, to make it brit∣tle; for, according to my information, without silver it would not be brittle at all. The Egyptian coins are cast in molds, and are very thick: perhaps this metal was used because best for casting. It is worth about 6<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> a pound weight.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="17">XVII. <HI>Contorniati,</HI> or ticket-medals.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. Coins of Gothic princes, &amp;c. inscrib∣ed with Roman characters.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. Coins of Southern nations, using un∣known alphabets; as the Persian, Punic, Etrus∣can, Spanish.</P>
<P N="20">XX. Coins of Northern nations, using un∣known characters; as the Runic and German.</P>
<P>In the Modern Part no series can be formed of copper that will go back above two centu∣ries;
<PB N="255" REF="295"/>but sequences of gold and of silver may be arranged of all the different empires, king∣doms, and states, so far as their several coinages will allow. Those of England and France will be the most perfect. Modern silver is com∣monly arranged in three sequences: the dollar-size, the shilling-size, and the groat-size. The medals of each modern country ought of course to be separated, tho it is best to arrange each set in chronological order, let their size or me∣tal be what they will. It may be remarked here that our modern medals, of the size of a tea-saucer, are only so many monuments of Gothicism. The ancient medallions are almost universally but little larger than our crown-piece, tho three or four of them may extend to two inches diameter, but very many modern medals to four inches and more. A large me∣dal always declares an ignorant prince, or an ignorant artist. Into the size of a crown-piece the ancients threw more miracles in this way than will ever appear on these monstrous pro∣ductions; but, as Zeuxis said to his scholar, who had daubed a paltry design with florid colours, <Q>“If thou hast not made it beautiful, thou hast ”made it rich,</Q> so it may be said to those enor∣mous artists, with this addition, that a pair of scales give the most just estimate of their works.</P>
<P>The formation of a cabinet of the Second Class next demands our attention. The direc∣tions
<PB N="256" REF="296"/>for the former will likewise apply to this, so far as it is meant to go. But as the Smaller Cabinet only includes a few complete sequences, either of ancient or modern coins, some more particular instructions may be given. If, for instance, the collector means to form a series of the Roman large brass, he will find the coins of four or five emperors so scarce as not to be at∣tainable in that series, even at any price. He must of necessity supply their places with the middle brass, as is allowed with regard to Otho even in the best cabinets, there not being above three coins of that emperor, in large brass, known in the world; whereas, of the middle brass, two or three hundred may exist. If this is allowed in one instance, why not in others? Why may not Tiberius, or Pertinax, appear in the middle brass, as well as Otho? I confess I can see no reason for the collector putting himself to a needless expence, which might be laid out in articles of more importance to his cabinet, merely that a series may receive a fini∣cal completion, which is of no necessity but it the eyes of visionaries. This will appear the more just when we consider th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it is not by the size of the coin only that <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, even th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most rigid in the superstition of their fantasti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> science, decide whether it belongs to the first or second brass, but by that of the head which it bears. The conclusion to be drawn from
<PB N="257" REF="297"/>these arguments is, that, in cabinets of the se∣cond class, the collector may mingle the middle with the large brass, as he thinks proper: and in like manner the small with the middle; tho it will not be so well to unite such dispropor∣tionate sizes as the large and the small. In the small sequence, however, there can be no harm in his mixing gold, silver, and brass, as chance or curiosity may lead him to purchase any of these metals. And tho your starched bigotted medallist may sneer, because such a sequence would controvert his formal and narrow way of thinking, common sense will authorise us to laugh at the pedant in our turn, and to pro∣nounce such a series more various, rich, and in∣teresting, than if the collector had only arranged one metal, and rejected a curious article because he did not collect gold or silver.</P>
<P>Pedantry, in most sciences, is now held in just contempt, but it yet reigns in the medallic line in a supreme degree. Nor is this surpriz∣ing, when it is considered that the pedants them∣selves are the giver of their own silly laws; for, excepting perhaps half a dozen instances, books upon this subject have only been written by men lost in the pedantry of numismatic erudition.</P>
<P>In like manner, if, in the Modern Part of the Smaller Cabinet, any coin of a series is of high price, or of bad impression, there can be no im∣propriety in putting another of the same reign,
<PB N="258" REF="298"/>which is cheaper, or better executed, tho of a different denomination, and a little larger size. In short, the collector has no rules, but in the Greek cities and Roman families to observe alphabetical order, and chronology in every thing else.</P>
<P>To assist a selection of a casket of medals no directions can be given, fancy being the only law. The arrangement may, however, be ma∣naged by the observations already made upon the two higher descriptions.</P>

<HEAD><HI>SECTION XXIV.</HI> Present Prices of Medals.</HEAD>
<P>THE current value of coins is subject to a few fluctuations, arising from the taste for medals being more, or less, prevalent at parti∣cular periods, and other causes. Yet, upon the whole, the present prices have taken place for a century or more, except in some instances; and may therefore be considered as permanent. They are certainly high enough in general; and, if any alteration takes place, it may safely be imagined that it will be in favor of the collector.</P>
<P>The gold coins of Greek cities are mostly very small; and not above a dozen states have yet been found in gold: of which only Carthage, Cyrene, and Syracuse, are rather common, and worth but double their intrinsic value. The other gold civic coins are worth from 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> to 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The king, who has about 400 gold coins, lately pro∣cured two <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> of Athens before unknown, for that in the Museum is suspected: of these the queen got one for Dr. Hunter, and they are
<PB N="260" REF="300"/>the only two gold coins of Athens known to exist. Dr. Hunter's, if sold, might bring the very highest price a coin can bear.</P>
<P>The silver coins of Greek cities are many of them extremely scarce. The common ones are priced according to their size, for the largest are always the rarest. Those of Syracuse, Dyrra∣chium, Massilia, Athens, and a few other states are common: drachms, and lesser sizes, may bring 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> each: didrachms, and tridrachms, from 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> according to beauty and pre∣servation.

<P>Of the copper civic medals of Greece many are common. They are almost all of those sizes which are called small brass in the Roman series: the middle size is scarce. The largest, prior to the Roman emperors, is of extreme scarcity. The <HI>obolus,</HI> arranged with copper in a former section, belongs to the
<PB N="261" REF="301"/>Greek imperial coins, with its half, or the he∣miobolium; for had they been current coins of ancient Greece in copper, as many of them must have reached us as of the Roman large brass; whereas not above one or two solitary ones will appear in a large series, and they of the Roman imperial times. We must conclude from this that the obolus, or sixth of a drachm, and the hemiobolium, or its twelfth, were al∣ways, in the better days of Greece, coined in silver; but, about the commencement of the Roman imperial times, were coined in copper, from the deficience of currency, arising from the tributes imposed by the victors, and in∣crease of the value of silver, as has been the case in modern times. There can be little scruple then in putting down the silver coins, now weighing about the sixth of a drachm, or 10 ½ grains, as oboli, and those about the twelfth, or 5 ½ grains, as hemiobolia. The weight is, however, often diminished by time, or indeed at the very coinage, for many drachms under com∣mon weight were issued by different states, at different times. That there is not a vast multi∣tude extant of these silver oboli, and hemio∣bolia, cannot be wondered at, when their ex∣treme smallness is considered; for to the same reason it is owing that so few of the silver half∣pence and farthings of our ancient kings are met with, tho certainly more current than their
<PB N="262" REF="302"/>pennies, and nearly as common as their present substitutes of copper. The analogy of the mo∣dern coinages of Europe likewise contributes very much to confirm this opinion, silver gra∣dually increasing in value till the minute coin∣ages can only appear in copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Perhaps the only oboli which occur in brass, previous to the time of Augustus, are those of the later Ptolemies, with a head of Jupiter on one side, and an eagle on the other, BAΣI∣ΛEOΣ ΠTOΛEMEIOΥ. Hemiobolia, nay, double and triple oboli, occur of this description. Some medallists call them weights, others medallions. Upon the most diligent scrutiny of the whole ancient writers who have made the least mention of the obolus, every one will be convinced that it, and its half, or the hemiobolium, were of silver, and not of copper, till the Roman empire prevailed over Greece. Hear Celsus, whose proof is posi∣tive: <Q>Unius deinde denarii pondus dividi a me in sex parte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> “id est, sex sextulas; ut idem in sextula denarii habeam, quo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ”Graeci habent in eo quem <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> appellant.</Q> This shews th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> obolus to have been a sixth of the drachm in weight likewise, a in value, consequently not of brass, but silver; for a brass obolus would have weighed ten denarii, or drachms. Indeed, the ver<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> name, <HI>chalcos,</HI> equivalent to the Roman <HI>as,</HI> or <HI>as,</HI> shews that th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was at first the highest brass coin, and called <HI>the piece of brass,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> way of eminence.

<P>The copper coins of the Greek kings are, in most instances, scarcer than the silver; and, like those of the cities, are almost all of the size called small brass. They ought to bring a high price; but the metal, and similarity to the copper civic coins, which are common, keep their actual purchase very moderate, if the seller is not well instructed, and the buyer able and willing to pay the price of rarity.</P>
<P>The Greek coins struck under the Roman empire will all be stated in the particular esti∣mate of imperial coins, to be found in the Ap∣pendix; which likewise leaves me but very few illustrations to add upon the prices of Ro∣man medals. A few classes, however, must be noticed, which do not fall into that plan.</P>
<P>Ancient Roman <HI>ases,</HI> with their divisions ig∣norantly enough termed weights<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The appellation of weights given to the largest Roman coins arises from strange ignorance. Roman weights are seen in lead, and sometimes in brass; but they have only the knobs, marking their proportion to the pound weight, upon one side, with little <HI>fleurettes</HI> around, but without the smallest shadow of busts or le∣gends, much loss of reverses, the other side being smooth and bare, that it may rest in the scale. Who ever heard of weights issued from a mint, o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> globular, as the more ancient <HI>ases</HI> are? The ab∣surdity is yet greater with regard to the large Greek brass, of one or two of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, some of which are of a size equal to the Roman ases. Medallists do not seem to reflect that the Greek obolus was equal in value, as P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bius tells us, to near two <HI>ases;</HI> and if struck in brass, even in the latest periods, must weigh about two ounces, and if in elder periods a pound, or a pound and a half. In short, wherever a piece of ancient metal is stamped on both sides with busts or figures, it may be laid down as a certain rule that it is a coin; but when marks of proportion of weight appear, with slight ornaments, upon one side only, in that case, and that alone, it is to be regarded as a weight.</NOTE>, bring from 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 5<ABBR><HI>s,</HI></ABBR> according to the singularity of their devices.</P>

<P>Upon the Roman imperial coins it must be observed, in general, that a few of many princes, whose medals are numerous, may yet be rendered very precious from uncommon re∣verses.

<P>The medals with unknown characters, it may be supposed, are of small expence.</P>
<P>The only modern coins and medals, particu∣larly treated in this work, are those of Great Britain and Ireland. A valuation of English coins, since the Conquest, will be found in the Appendix: what remain to be briefly mention-here are those previous to the Conquest, English medals, and the coins of Scotland and Ireland. Saxon pennies of the heptarchic princes are generally rare, and worth from 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 2<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 2<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> each, according to scarcity and preservation. Those of the kings of all England are some very common, Edward the Confessor in parti∣cular; others rare, and worth from 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to

<P>Of English medals, the gold ones of Henry, 1545, and of Edward's coronation, are worth 20<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> each. The Mary of Trezzo, 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> The dearest of Simon's works are his head of Thur∣loe, in gold, 12<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> his oval medal, in gold, upon Blake's victory at sea, 30<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>; his Tryal Piece, if brought to a sale, would, there is little doubt, bring upwards of that money. Queen Anne's medals in gold, intrinsically worth about two guineas and a half, bear about 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> a piece; the silver, of about the size of a crown-piece, will bring 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> each; the copper from 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> The copper-pieces of Dassier fetch from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/><ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> to 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> each; save a few which bear higher price. Such are some of the principal English medals mentioned in this essay: to enumerate the whole were impossible in the limits to which it is confined.</P>
<P>The Scotish coins are on a par with the Eng∣lish, except that the gold sell higher. The shilling of Mary with the bust is very rare, and brings 30<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; the 3<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> piece, 5<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 5<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR> The French crown of Francis and Mary brings 10<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> 10<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR>; the Scotish one of Mary and Henry would bring 50<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>; as would the medal of James IV.

<P>The English coins struck in Ireland, or ap∣propriated to that kingdom, are mostly of the same price as the other English coins. The St. Patrick's halfpence and farthings are rather scarce. The gun-money of James II. is quite common. The rare crown of white metal never was exposed to sale, but, if it was, could not bring much. All other Irish coins are very common.</P>

<ITEM>Tho the silver coin of Scotland was, till the reign of Mary, upon the scale of that of England; the gold and copper coinages of Scotland have no connection with the English. The St. Andrew supposed of Robert II. weighs but 38 grains: the English noble of that period 107 grains; so that the first forms no division of the later. That thought to be of Robert III. weighs 60 grains; and that of James I, 53 or 54, which last being half the English noble, got the title of <HI>Demy,</HI> as in the foregoing acts: the St. Andrew or Lion of James II. is of equal weight. The St. Andrew on one side, and arms of Scotland on the other, continue the sole bearings of the Scotish gold coin, till James III. when the unicorn appears holding the shield. That prince's largest gold coin weighs 60 grains: and the bonnet piece of James V. 90 grains, with a smaller of 60 grains: the lion of Mary, with her cypher, weighs 78 grains; the golden ryal, 1555, with her bust, 115 grains, being the very weight of the ryals of Elizabeth, which are so extremely rare, and which went for 15<ABBR><HI>s.</HI></ABBR></ITEM>

<HEAD><HI>N<SUP>o</SUP> IV.</HI> An estimate of the rarity of all the Coins of Roman Emperors, with their prices.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM>THE first writer who seems to have formed an idea of this estimate was Savot, in his <HI>Dis∣cours sur les medailles,</HI> Paris, 1627, followed by Bau∣delot, in his book <HI>De l'utilité des voyages,</HI> Paris, 1686. The Baron Ezekiel Spanheim succeeded; a man of great distinction in life, and of no mean knowledge of medals. His manuscript is extant in the British Museum, No 3879, of Mr. Ayscough's Catalogue (not to be named without praise, as the best digested ever yet offered to the public), and is entitled <HI>Numis∣mata Imperatoria, secundum varios raritatis gradus, per Ezekiel<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m Spanhemium.</HI> He uses no less than eight degrees of rarity, which is indeed a superfluous nicety, and his whole list is very full of mistakes, whence it is in fact of infinitely more prejudice than utility.</ITEM>
<ITEM>The next attempt of this kind was by a French writer of later period, and better information. It is annexed to the best, but now very rare, edition of La Science des Medailles, Paris 1739. 2 tomes, 12mo. and tho insinitely preferable to that of Spanheim, yet is by no means faultless.</ITEM>
<ITEM>At length M. Beauvais, one of the first medallists of the age, set about this necessary work, and pro∣duced
<PB N="291" REF="330"/>his <HI>Histoire Abregée des Empereurs Romains,</HI> Paris 1767. 3 tomes, 12mo. They however who advised him to swell his estimate, at first his only in∣tention, with short accounts of all the emperors and empresses, gave unnecessary counsel, for the work were better without them. However this has no effect upon his valuation, which may be looked upon as the most perfect that can well appear. He was the first writer who added the prices, which is a vast improvement: and the assistance which he had from M. Pellerin, and others, the first medallists in France, almost ensures infallibility to his labours. which I have had before my eye, and almost copied, but with several additions and alterations, in every instance of the succeeding estimate.</ITEM>
<ITEM>In France and Italy most medals bear a higher price than in England: in other countries a lower. This is owing solely to the vast prevalence of this study in Italy and France; and its being less general, and much less violent, here. The prices therefore fixt by M. Beauvais are in a few instances reduced one half, to accommodate them to this country: these alter∣ations are however almost all authorized by atten∣tion to sales, and sale catalogues, and other practical modes of information. Yet in very important ar∣ticles, such as medallions, and coins of supreme scarcity, no change could take place; because if they cannot bring the high value here, the seller may send them with ease to Paris, so that the price must be the same, if they are bought in this country at all. To make this estimate as compact as possible, the following abbreviations are used.</ITEM>

<ITEM>Marcus Aurelius Severus Antoninus Aug. (CARA∣CALLA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The coins of Caracalla not being casily distinguished from those of Elagabalus, the names being the same, a few marks may be necessary. Caracalla has commonly the title GER <HI>Manicus,</HI> or <HI>BRITannicus,</HI> which the other never has. Elagabalus bears most commonly FELix. Caracalla seldom is styled IMP. Elagabalus always. But the most certain mark is the sun, delineated like an asterisk, and thence by medallists vulgarly termed a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar, which is almost always seen on coins of Elagabalus, behind or before the figures on the reverse. It is well known that he was priest of the sun, and thence the mark; which may likewise be found on coins of Julia Soaemias his mother, and on others. Some French writers will have it, that this badge appears also on one or two coins of Caracalla, which I must beg leave to impute to mistake till the strongest proof shall arise of their position, which I strongly suspect to be quite void of foundation.</NOTE>A.

Collectors supply the place of silver, in this interval, with copper washed with silver; nay, with the copper of Probus, which is only washed with tin. But these coins were neyer held silver currency in any period of the empire, for they are common in reigns when good silver is also frequent; that of Gallienus for example: not to add, that <HI>quinarij</HI> of good silver occur in these very reigns to which so bad a coinage is ascribed; and who will suppose that the denarius was of washed copper, and its half of good silver? The denarij washed with silver, or with tin, were evidently the <HI>denarij <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rei</HI> of the age of Aure∣lian; and had no more concern with silver currency than the black-money, and tin half-pence, of modern times. They who form sequences in distinct metals ought to keep the copper washed with silver, or with tin, among the series of small brass, or more properly apart by itself; but upon no account to blend it with the silver currency. It is truly risible to see such collectors mixing these coins with silver, or with brass, just as the washing happen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be in better, or worse, preservation; nay, some are so ignorant as to pronounce the fresh ones silver currency of the period!
<P>These remarks ought likewise to be applied to the Egyptian coins of brittle brass; and those of the same country in billon, or those washed with silver. The latter two articles ought to be kept apart from the first by formal collectors, were it only on ac∣count of their colour.</P></NOTE></ITEM>

<LIST>
<ITEM>P. 151 Some of our first medallists inform me, that, upon ac∣curate inspection and examination, the two English pennies of Richard I. prove to be spurious. Mr. Folkes's Pables, and Snelling's View of the Silver Coinage, led me into this error; which is a proof among many how little the best medallic works are to be trusted. These pennies are thought to be the fabrications of a certain col∣lector, notorious in this way, and who must suppose that to em∣barrass the path of any science with forgery and futility implies no infamy. In forgeries of antient coin the fiction is, perhaps, sufficiently atoned by the vast skill required; and the artist may plausibly alledge, that his intention was not to deceive, but to excite his utmost power by an attempt to rival the antient masters. But no possible apology can be made for forging the rude money of former modern times. The crime is certainly greater than that which leads the common coiner to the gallows, inasmuch as it is committed with more ease, and the profit is incomparably larger. The person above hinted at may therefore rest assured, that, when his death shall have rendered the mention of his name safe and free from cruelty, not all his good qualities will prevent its being delivered to posterity with perpetual contempt and obloquy.</ITEM>

<ITEM>P. 212. I. 24. The first piece marked on the edge is a silver <HI>piedsort</HI> of Charles IX. of France, dated 1573. The first medal
<PB REF="365"/>is one in silver of George Frederic Marquis of Brandenburg, dated 1589: the legend on the edge of which last is, CONCORDIA RES PARVAE CRESCVNT, DISCORDIA RES MAXIMAE DILABVNTVR. G. F. M. B. SACRUM. 1589. Both these pieces are in the pos∣session of Mr. Miles, and have been inspected by the author.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 260. Tridrachms are all very scarce, but not the more va∣lued on account of their name: however, they may always class with tetradrachms in price. Some civic tetradrachms, of exceed∣ing rarity and preservation, will bring from one to four guineas.</ITEM>

<ITEM>P. 276. Good pennies of Henry I. or of Stephen, are worth 2<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> each. Delete the sentence with regard to English coins of Richard I.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 277. The pieces, called groats of Edward I. are all proofs; and it is dubious if they were meant for pieces of that name. It is also more likely that they belong to Edward II. or III.</ITEM>
<ITEM>P. 279. Medallists assert, that there are quarter florins of Ed∣ward III. known, tho it seems doubtful if they are not coins of Aquitain. They have a helmet on one side, with a field of fleurs-de-luce; and not above one or two have yet appeared. There are two other gold coinages of Edward III. preceding his 27th year: the last of which has 42 nobles to the pound weight.
