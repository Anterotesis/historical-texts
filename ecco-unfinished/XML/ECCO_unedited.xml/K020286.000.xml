<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Cannot commit this Tragedy to the press without availing myself of the opportu∣nity to acknowledge the support you gave it on the stge. I felt myself under the weight of a responsibility during its trial before the Public, which made those moments extremely anxious; for had I been adjudged guilty of misemploying your talents, I must have sunk under the sentence without appeal, conscious of having conceived the fable, and addressed every feature and expression of the prevailing character professedly to you: in short there was no possible shelter for self-prejudice (had that been amongst my failings) to resort to, where all the Performers stood so ably in the scene, and where the spectacle was so fully
<PB N="iv" REF="3"/>
furnished by the liberality of the Proprietors, that I can honestly declare my endeavours, antecedent to the exhibition, had not been employed to urge their spirit to expence, but on the contrary to restrain it.</P>
<P>I am deeply grateful to a generous and can∣did Audience for their reception of this Tra∣gedy; and though I am not to learn how much of their applause rests personally with you and your associates in the cast, I am no less penetrated with a sense of the favours I am to transfer to others, than of those which I may be permitted to retain to myself.</P>
<P>The character of our Drama in its best ex∣amples is so close to Nature, that you, Madam, who are apt to give so perfect a reflection of her image, seem born for the elevation of the British stage. The Author, who shall write for you, must copy from no other model but Nature; every thing must be addressed to the spectator's heart, and of course must flow from his own; artificial situations, tricking inci∣dents and studied declamations, must be thrown aside where you are to appear; it will not be his aim to make you loquacious
<PB N="v" REF="4"/>
in the scene, because he has such fine recita∣tion to resort to, nor will he call you out into starts and attitudes, merely because he has a form so striking to display at his command; glittering passages and traps for plaudits will be beneath his attention; he will lead sim∣plicity in his hand, and keep sublimity in his eye.</P>
<P>To such a Poet may I now consign you!—Yet before I make over so valuable a convey∣ance, let me apprise him of the extent of his good fortune; and that it is not only in the public representation of his scenes where he will find your importance, but in every stage of the business preparatory to their exhibition. To add one voice to a multitude is a small tribute to your talents; but to bear testimony to your zeal, diligence, and punctuality in all those duties of your profession, which, though of equal moment, are of less notoriety, falls first to my lot; and if my successor shall feel these offices as sensibly as I do, he will ac∣knowledge stronger reasons to esteem you for the good qualities originating with yourself, than for the brilliant gifts which you derive from nature.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5"/>
Proceed in your course, and depend upon a generous Public. It would be living to an evil purpose indeed, if it were for no other purpose but to depress them we live with; and your contemporaries will not fail to see how much it is their concern to foster and pro∣tect a genius, which contributes to render their own times and their own country superior to all others.</P>

<LG>
<L>OLD Drury's dock prepares a launch this night,</L>
<L>New from the keel, (fair speed The Carmelite!)</L>
<L>True British-built, and from the Tragic slip;</L>
<L>She mounts great guns—tho' not a first-rate ship:</L>
<L>A gallant Knight commands, of ancient fame</L>
<L>And Norman blood, <HI>Saint Valori</HI> his name;</L>
<L>On his main-top the Christian Cross he bears,</L>
<L>From Holy Land he comes, and Pagan wars:</L>
<L>Twenty long years his lady mourns him dead,</L>
<L>And bathes with faithful tears a widow'd bed;</L>
<L>Our scene presents him ship-wreck'd on her coast—</L>
<L>No sign, we hope, our venture will be lost.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet bold the Bard, to mount ambition's wave,</L>
<L>And launch his wit upon a watery grave;</L>
<L>Sharp critic rocks beneath him lie in wait,</L>
<L>And envious quicksands bar the Muse's straight;</L>
<L>Wild o'er his head Detraction's billows break,</L>
<L>Doubt chills his heart, and terror pales his cheek:</L>
<L>Hungry and faint, what cordials can he bring</L>
<L>From the cold nymph of the Pierian spring?</L>
<L>What stores collect from bare Parnassus' head,</L>
<L>Where blooms no vineyard, where no beeves are fed?</L>
<L>And great Apollo's laurels, which impart</L>
<L>Fame to his head, are famine to his heart.—</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet on he toils, and eager bends his eyes,</L>
<L>Where Fame's bright temple glitters to the skies.</L>
<L>Ah, Sirs, 'tis easy work, to sit on shore</L>
<L>And tutor him who tugs the labouring oar:</L>
<L>Whilst he amidst the surging ocean steers,</L>
<L>Now here, now there, as fashion's current veers:</L>
<L>Rouse, rouse for his protection! you, who sit</L>
<L>Rang'd in deep phalanx, arbiters of wit!</L>
<L>And you aloft there, keep your beacon bright,</L>
<L>Oh, make your Eddy-stone shew forth it's light;</L>
<L>So shall our Bard steer to its friendly blaze,</L>
<L>And anchor in the haven of your praise.</L>

<L>No; yet it moves my wonder why your conscience,</L>

<L>That sting is grief:</L>
<L>You mourn a wife perhaps, or some dear friend,</L>

<L>By the devouring bankrupt waves for ever:</L>
<L>What then? your cares have perish'd with your fortune.</L>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>HILDEBRAND.</SPEAKER>
<L>The wreck of friends and fortune I bewail</L>

<L>Then I conjectur'd right, and 'tis remorse</L>
<L>Which tortures you; I read it in your eyes:</L>

<L>None, no wounds;</L>
<L>Nor was he in his youth, as when he died,</L>
<L>But grey with years, and much transform'd by time:</L>
<L>At first I knew him not, and as he spoke</L>

<L>I came this instant from the Carmelite</L>

<L><PB N="61" REF="68"/>
The breathless corpse of Hildebrand; the Monk</L>
<L>In his last moments had been private with him:</L>
<L>I urg'd the murder, to his own confession</L>
<L>Appealing in my accusation's proof;</L>
<L>When, strange to tell! his confessor the Monk</L>
<L>Boldly denied that he had kill'd Saint Valori.</L>
<L>Rous'd at this daring insult and indignant</L>
<L>I turn'd upon De Courci, and demanded</L>
<L>If he wou'd vouch the falsehood; he, more hot</L>
<L>And no less confident than t'other, hurl'd</L>
<L>Defiance in my teeth, and to the ground</L>
<L>Threw down his gauntler, pledging to the truth</L>
<L>Of what the Monk affirm'd.</L>

<L>I am amaz'd;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>MONTGOMERI.</SPEAKER>
<L>Before I could reply,</L>
<L>The Carmelite had seiz'd De Courci's pledge,</L>

<L>A haughty warrior than a son of peace,</L>
<L>Sternly forbade the challenge to proceed:</L>

<BYLINE>By the AUTHOR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS.</BYLINE>
<LG>
<L>LADIES, we now have shewn a faithful wise,</L>
<L>And trust our scene prevails in real life;</L>
<L>We hope that nupital truth's your reigning passion,</L>
<L>If not—why let the stage begin the fashion:</L>
<L>'Tis c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs to paint you innocent and true;</L>
<L>To be what we describe depends on you—</L>
<L>Two <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ragic masters grac'd th' Athenian stage,</L>
<L>One s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ctch'd with caudour, t'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her dash'd with rage:</L>
<L>Old Sephocles's dames were heav<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly creatures,</L>
<L>His rival <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rew them all in sury features;</L>
<L>Both err'd, perhaps.—The <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilder urg'd this plea,</L>
<L>"I paint my women as they ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht to be:"</L>
<L>The angry bard, relentless to the Fair,</L>
<L>Sternly replied, "I paint mine as they are."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author (pardon if he brings his name</L>
<L>Too near to these of an immortal same)</L>
<L>At humble distance takes the milder plan,</L>
<L>Less proud to be a poet than a man:</L>
<L>Scorns first to forge and then enforce a crime,</L>
<L>Or polish libels into truth by rhyme.</L>
<L>If you have faults, alas! he bids me say,</L>
<L>Oh! that his wish cou'd charm them all away!</L>
<L>For if no cure but caustics can be found,</L>
<L>He will not make a sore to heal a wound;</L>
<L>If you have saults, they're faults he won't discover,</L>
<L>To your own sex he legs to bind you over.</L>
<L>So many ladies now there are who write,</L>
<L>You'll hear of all your trips some winter's night:</L>
<L>Since Pegasus has learn'd the jadish trick</L>
<L>To bear a side sadale, you'll final him hick.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let no saty<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ist touch my lips with gall,</L>
<L>Lips from which none but grateful words shall fall.</L>
<L>Can I forget?—But I must here be dumb,</L>
<L>So vast my debt. I cannot count the sum;</L>
<L>Words would int fail me, and I claim no art,</L>
<L>I beast in eloquence—but of the heart.</L>
