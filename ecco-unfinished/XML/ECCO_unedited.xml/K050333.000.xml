<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SUch was the Strength of a Strugling Party in this Nation,
that it cannot be expected they should go off of the Stage
of Action without making various Efforts, to retrieve
their Expiring Interest.</P>
<P>And 'tis a peculiar Happiness to the present Establish't
Peace of this Government, to see the Opposers of the Publick
Good, thus brought to the last Extremities.</P>
<P>Envy, (like the dying Pangs of a strong Man) is known by
its particular Efforts; the Convulsions Expiring Nature falls
into, when the fatal Parting is in view, are so particular, that
you may know the approaching Separation is near, by the pro∣per
Symptoms of Death upon the Patient.</P>
<P>Thus the Struggles of the Party, in this Kingdom, have ma∣nifest
Tokens and Symptoms upon them of the approaching
Death of their Cause; They are descended to Railing,
instead of Argument; to Prevarications in Fact, to reproaching
Vertue, to defaming Merit, to searching for Crimes, and ac∣cusing
the Innocent, to Suggestion, Surmise, Mis-construction,
pretended Fore-bodings, prophesying Evil Tidings, canting
Exclamations, and all the little and low Steps that have the
least Prospect, tho' not of Bettering their own Cause, yet of
Dividing, Blackening, and Throwing Dirt upon those whose
Vertues they hate, because they envy their Glory.</P>
<P>Time was, this Party made Attempts that had some Air of
Vigour, and of which there was some reason to be Apprehen∣sive;
and in such Cases the Nation was really, and indeed, just∣ly
allarm'd at them, and took Care with Needful Caution, to
prevent their Mischievous Designs; and tho' they were indeed
treated like Children, or Mad-men, <HI>for whom we retain a Respect,
tho' they would mischief us,</HI> and their Hands were only tyed
<PB N="2" REF="4"/>
from Harm, without giving them the Personal Mortifications
they had deserv'd; yet it was thought likewise proper to re∣move
them from all Power of doing Ill, by taking the edg'd
Tools and wicked Weapons out of their Hands, such as Legisla∣tion,
Ministry, Commands, Commissions, Trusts, Sallaries,
disposal of Offices, and the like.</P>
<P>While they had these Things in their Hands, the Lunacy of
their Heads made them Dangerous People; and it was
too much in their Power, to make Experiments, tack
Persecution Laws, betray Councils, disappoint Expeditions, re∣tard
Preparations, erect Parties, influence Governours, infringe
Liberties, invade Properties, and a thousand other things pe∣culiar
to the Principle of their Party, to Divide this Nation, Ex∣pose
us to fatal Dissentions at Home, and at last deliver us up to
Potent Enemies Abroad.</P>
<P>But now the Power of doing these Mischiefs is taken from
them, and they are remov'd at a due Distance from Action,
the Nation has a double Satisfaction; one, to see 'tis out of
their Power to Effect those publick and fatal Disorders they had
in their Design; and the other, to see them discover plainly
what was in their very Nature, and what they would have
Executed by the weak Self-destroying Efforts of an Impotent
Ungovern'd Rage.</P>
<P>Now, like the Dog that bites the Stone, because he cannot
reach the Hand that throws it, they act all the most weak, fool∣ish,
and absurd Parts, that Distraction and Desperation can
Dictate.</P>
<P>I could enumerate abundance of these Unaccountable Expres∣sions
of the present Frenzy of the Party, such as High-Church
Memorials, Inflammation-Sermons, Coffee-house-Declamations,
Noble P—r's Speeches, H-—of C-—Tower-Excursions,
and the like: All which, were I to discuss the Particulars, I
would freely appeal to the Gentlemen themselves, whether
they have not sensibly sunk their own Cause, weaken'd the
very Opinions of their own Admirers, discourag'd their Friends,
driven Numbers of wavering Auxiliar Converts from them,
and by Consequence, confirm'd the present Establishment of Par∣ty-Peace
in the Nation, at the Expence of all their Hopes,
Prospects, and Expectations.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="5"/>
And as a further Demonstration of the sensible Decay of
the Numbers, Interests, and Hopes of the Party, we find them,
now descend yet lower; and cloathing themselves in various
Shapes, they stoop to act in Masquerade, and Counterfeit that
Honesty they would Overthrow; and even in this, they have
the Happiness to make such miserable Chasma's and Spaces in
their Scenes, that the Design lies Naked to Common View, and
he must be unaccountably blind, that cannot see through the
thin Covering of this foolish, and most ridiculous Disguise.</P>
<P>But because there were some People who could not under∣stand
<HI>the Shortest Way with the Dissenters,</HI> and whose Judgments
are too often hood-wink't with light Outsides, that (like the
Old Woman, <HI>That could see the Needle, but could not see the
Barn</HI>) overlook Things at Hand, and see Things Remote:
The Author of this, hopes they will not take it amiss, if he at∣tempts
to Expose the Nudities of the present Undertakings, and
tell the World who they are, and with what Design, that
amuse the Age with false Lights, the <HI>Igni fatui,</HI> of Abortive
Envy, and Defeated Malice.</P>
<P>If pursuing this Design, brings me to consider more particu∣larly
some Persons and Things which too justly merit their
Place among the Disturbers of the Nation's Peace, let such as
think themselves touch'd, blame their own Guilt. I shall a∣void
Personal Reflections as much as possible; but Truth being
the only Thing capable of Effecting this Necessary Underta∣king,
it must be spoken out; and if its Plainness affects any
Body, the reason of it will be found among themselves.</P>
<P>It would be endless to enter upon the many little Steps, ta∣ken
by those I am talking of, to raise Dust in the Eyes of the
People, against their Benefactors; I shall therefore fix my Dis∣course
upon a late Extraordinary Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>A Let∣ter
to the Author of the Memorial of the State of</HI> England.</P>
<P>To usher this Book into the World, it was necessary to find
such a Thing, of which <HI>Hudibras</HI> gives a very significant De∣scription.</P>
<Q><L>—a Tool</L>
<L>Which Wise Men work with, call'd a F—.</L></Q>
<P><PB N="4" REF="6"/>
To find out this, requir'd some Art; for to have brought one
of their own Party upon the Stage, had been only calling a
Spade, a Spade, and been Memorial the <HI>second,</HI> the same Thing
over again; but it was necessary, the Man should not only talk
like a Whig, but <HI>be a Whig,</HI> at least one that had past for such,
and whose Disguise was not yet thrown off.</P>
<P>This was absolutely necessary, that the Dissenters might be
effectually cheated, amus'd, and wheedl'd, to fall in with the
Thing, give it their good Word; and, as some Men are al∣ways
to be found that love Calumny, should give a better
Reception to it in the World.</P>
<P>To forward this, it was industriously spread abroad, that it
was wrote by a Dissenter; the Book was secretly handed about
among some of our unhappily, and too ignorantly prejudic'd
Friends, and the Delusion spread a great way.</P>
<P>At last it came out, and appeared to be wrote by a Clergy∣man
of the Ch. of <HI>England,</HI> and as such I am to consider it.</P>
<P>The Book (<HI>to give a short Description of it</HI>) is <HI>Another Shortest
Way with the Dissenters;</HI> a Papist set up for a-Patriot, a Devil
in the Disguise of a Whig, a High-Church-man Masqueraded
into a <HI>Williamite;</HI> and the Cloven Foot appears so Naked, that
he cannot tax me with want of Charity in my Opinion; for who
can resist Demonstration?</P>
<P>I allow, in some parts of it, the Colours are lively enough,
and some, even of the Wiser, may be deceiv'd; and I shall not
be wanting to do him Justice.</P>
<P>There was a Book wrote some Months since, Entituled, <HI>A
Memorial of the State of</HI> England, <HI>in answer to the Memorial of
the Church.</HI> I shall not trouble this Tract with my Opinion of its
Performance; I believe it was honestly meant; if it had a
soft Place in it, or any imperfect, or ill-manag'd Part, 'twas
under that Head, where he takes upon him, to defend the
present Ministry, by making Reflections on some Gentlemen
that Manag'd in King <HI>William's</HI> Time.</P>
<P>That this gives the Author of this Pamphlet a good Handle,
and some Advantage, I am very free to own; but whether he
makes a just Use of it, will come under the Cognizance of the
Ensuing Sheets.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="7"/>
Without doubt, this Mistake of the Author of <HI>The State-Memorial,</HI>
put it into our Author's Head, to Personate the
Whig, and make a Scheme, which without question in its first
Prospect, pleas'd the Contriver very well; for on the foot of
this Project, he fancies he has bid fair for a Three-fold Divi∣sion.</P>
<P>1.
To divide the present Ministry from the last, and break
the good Correspondance between the Gentlemen Managing
under King <HI>William,</HI> and those to whom Her Majesty has com∣mitted
the publick Affairs; as if acting from the same General
Principles of publick Good, they must differ, because the Per∣sons
and Circumstances, under which they acted, do not exact∣ly
chime.</P>
<P>2. To divide the present Ministry from one another, bend∣ing
the Stress of their Forces against one part, and leaving o∣thers
untouch'd, that if possible, they might seem to render
one Culpable, and the other Innocent; and prompt the Inno∣cent
to separate from the Guilty, to avoid the Cenfure.</P>
<P>3. To divide between the present Ministry and the People,
and fill the Nation with Jealousies and Dislike of those, who
hazard their All to serve them, to fill the Nation with Reflections
upon their best Endeavours, throw Dirt at their Persons, and
suggest Evil Designs, even from the Best and Uprightest Pro∣ceedings
in the World.</P>
<P>The first of these Designs, has the only proper Advantage
the Author wanted, <HI>viz.</HI> to cover him with the pretended Vi∣zor
of a Whig; and 'tis as apparent, that all the fine soft
Things he says of the Gentlemen he would be thought to de∣fend,
are meerly Ironical, at least in his Design; as 'tis certain,
those Gentlemen need no Defence of their Actions from any
thing, which the present Methods of the Government, or Mi∣nistry,
lays upon them.</P>
<P>As to the Mistaken Politicks of the Author of <HI>the State-Me∣morial,</HI>
I shall leave the two Authors to defend themselves as
well as they can, and proceed a little to dissect the Hypocrite
in this before me, and thro' his Weak Coverings, to discover
what's apparently hidden under his Sheep's Cloathing.</P>
<P>He begins his Epistle, to the Author of <HI>the State-Memorial,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="8"/>
with a seeming Complement, upon the first Three Parts of his
Book, and tells him 'tis Unanswerable; so distinct, so solid, so
close, that 'tis without Exception, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet, even in this
very first Paragraph, discovers himself in one of the Keenest
Satyrs of all his Book, <HI>viz.</HI> very Civilly calling him <HI>Coxcomb,</HI>
that had not said one Word but what had been said before,
had borrow'd all his Arguments from other People that had
Treated on the same Subject; and so his whole Book, and all
its Unanswerable, Unexceptionable Beauties, were not one
Word to the Purpose, and left the Age not a jot the Wiser.</P>
<Q>“Nor do I Esteem it the less, because the Argument is Ex∣hausted,
and thereby Discuss'd before, by several
Able Hands. <HI>p. 1. l.</HI> 8.”</Q>
<P>This is all <HI>Sarcastick;</HI> and to say he does not Esteem it the
less, <HI>is bestowing the Favour,</HI> as if he had said, <HI>Nor, Sir, do I
Esteem it the less,</HI> tho' I ought to do so, <HI>since you have said no∣thing,
but what Wiser Men have said before you.</HI></P>
<P>Observe next, how he comes to discourse of Persecution, and
when he would pretend to explode it; he justifies it from the
very Example quoted by his Adversary, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>“I will not deny, but that something might reasonably have
been said for Persecution of Dissenters in the <HI>Jewish</HI> Com∣mon-wealth,
and among Turks and Heathens, whose
main Points of Religion consisted in the <HI>Opera operata</HI> of
External Ceremonies, and Bodily Performances, which,
as to the Matter and Manner of them, were laid down
and instituted in express, positive and intelligible Terms:
But to talk of Persecution in a Religion which consists of
Mysteries and Duties which are to be believ'd, and per∣form'd
altogether in a mental and spiritual Manner, and
which the Infliction of Corporal Punishments can in no
manner influence o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amend, must needs be the most mon∣strous
and absurd Conceit that ever enter'd into the
Minds of such, who have the Priviledge of Think∣ing.”</Q>
<P>Now 'tis apparent, that the Persecution of Dissenters here
pretended to be argued against, <HI>is not</HI> for that part of Religion
which <HI>consists of Mysteries and Duties, which are to be believ'd
<PB N="7" REF="9"/>
and perform'd altogether in a mental and spiritual Manner, p.</HI> 1. but
for those Things which, <HI>as he says,</HI> consist in <HI>the opera operata
of External Ceremonies, and Bodily Performances,</HI> ibid. and for
these, he owns it proper to persecute: So that this is fairly an
Attempt, under the Colour of Exploding Persecution in gene∣ral,
to justfy it in particular; and to me, seems a plain Insinu∣ation,
that it is Lawful to Persecute Dissenters, who differ a∣bout
the <HI>opera operata</HI> of External Ceremonies, but not the Pa∣pists,
who differ in Mysteries and Duties, to be perform'd in a
mental and spiritual Manner.</P>
<P>I should be very loth to be tax'd here with a Breach of Cha∣rity,
in charging this seeming Whig, with Advocating for the
Papists; but I hope the following Particulars will clear me of
that Scandal; wherein I think it will appear, without Possibili∣ty
of Dispute, That either this Author is <HI>a Papist</HI> in his Heart,
or one of those Exceeding Charitable Church-men, who have
lately taken up that very Modern Christian Principle, That
<HI>they had rather be Papists, than Dissenters;</HI> or if not, he sincere∣ly
Advocates for the Papist, in order to Conceal himself as a
Whig; the <HI>Mystery</HI> of which is <HI>wholly Mental,</HI> as he notes of Re∣ligion,
and past my Understanding to unfold.</P>
<P>To make out this Charge, I appeal to his next Argument a∣gainst
Persecution; wherein, taking what he says for granted,
he proves the Church of <HI>England</HI> ought to be persecuted by the
Papists, and the Dissenters by the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as plain,
as that two and three makes five. See <HI>p. 2. l.</HI> 7.</P>
<Q>“Toleration therefore is a Claim which all Christians may
demand as a Natural and Common Right, unless it be
those that refuse the same Justice to their Fellow-Crea∣tures;
for it is evident, that such Persons ought to be
Excluded from it; as those who will not suffer others to
live, forfeit the Title to their own Lives.”</Q>
<P>Now the next five Pages of the Book are wholly taken up,
in proving, That both the Dissenters to the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
and the Church of <HI>England</HI> to the Papists, did, when in
their Power, deny Toleration to others; and what can be more
Natural, than to argue from thence, that both ought to be ex∣cluded
from it themselves? And which he very naturally does to
<PB N="8" REF="10"/>
my Hand, where he owns it his Opinion, they ought to be perse∣cuted,
eve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n so many Words, <HI>p. 2. l. 2, 3, He that persecutes
for Opinion, let him suffer for Opinion.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, the Author draws another Inference, which still,
as he thinks, carrys on the Mask, but too poorly to hide the
former Design: His Inference is <HI>P.</HI> 2. That the whole Con∣tention
in <HI>England</HI> is about Places and Pensions, and that the
Clamours of promoting the Interest of the Church, have had
no other Ultimate Consequence these twenty Years.</P>
<P>Now tho' this may be partly too true in Fact, yet I cannot
see how this Relative belongs to the other Antecedent, how this
Conclusion can be drawn from the other Premises; which, to
my Apprehension, are as remote as <HI>Mahomet</HI> and <HI>Jupiter.</HI></P>
<P>But the other Argument, I think, stands fairly prov'd in his
Book, and of which I draw this short Abstract from his own
Words.</P>
<P>Those Persons who refuse Toleration to others, ought to be Excluded
from it themselves. <HI>Letter, p. 2. l.</HI> 9.</P>
<P>But the Dissenters, when uppermost, prov'd most Furious in their
Persecutions, and would Exercise the same, or worse Cruelties, <HI>&amp;c.
Letter, p. 3. l.</HI> 10, 17, 21.</P>
<P>But the C. of <HI>E.</HI> in the Days of <HI>Ed.</HI> 6. burnt an Anabaptist,
Heretick, and <HI>Cranmer</HI> press'd the King to Sign the Warrant.
<HI>p. 5. l.</HI> 21.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Neither the <HI>Dissenter,</HI> nor the <HI>Church of England</HI> de∣serve,
but ought to be Excluded from Toleration.</P>
<P>If this be not fair arguing from the Premises here laid down,
I am content to submit, and when fairly refuted, will ask
Pardon.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>if it be,</HI> I refer the Principles of my
Antagonist, who pretends himself a <HI>Whig,</HI> to the Judgment of
every Impartial Reader.</P>
<P>His <HI>Reflections</HI> all along, upon the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and
upon Arch-bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Constancy, which he says, was
quite different at his Death, from that of a <HI>Socinian,</HI> that was
also burnt in K. <HI>Edward</HI>'s Days, farther explain the Man; and
it cannot but raise the Wonder of any Man, to see a Man cloath'd
with the Office and Honour of a Ch. of <HI>England</HI> Minister, first
<PB N="9" REF="11"/>
defend the Papists, then call the <HI>Socinian</HI> a good Christian, then
plead for Persecuting the Dissenter, and at last expose the Na∣kedness
of the C. of <HI>England</HI> it self, and upbraid that very
Church <HI>He is a Minister of,</HI> with burning an Anabaptist imme∣diately
after she was her self deliver'd from the Fire and Fag∣got
of Popish Persecution; a Thing, however true and justly
to be censur'd, he should have been one of the last Men to have
brought to Remembrance; and no History, but the <HI>Roman</HI>
Account of that Day, ever reflected upon the Conduct of that
Blessed Martyr in his last Moments; the burning of his right
Hand, in Detestation of his sinful Compliance with them, be∣ing
never disputed, no, not by his Enemies.</P>
<P>I could give another Demonstration of the Principle of this
Author, from a farther Excursion of his <HI>meer Self, p. 5. l.</HI> 6, 7,
8; where, <HI>the Essay at Catholick Communion,</HI> a Book lately
wrote by a known Papist, is plainly Reviv'd, and a Tolerati∣on
of Popery demanded as a piece of Justice of the Dissenters,
being the same Thing lately recommended to the Dissenters by
Mr. <HI>Toland,</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q>And I think, at this time, it would tend very much to their Honour, as
well as Benefit (speaking to the Dissenters) to approve of an Ʋniversal
Toleration of all manner of Opinions that are meerly religious, and
respect Conscience only.</Q>
<P>I think I have said enough to unmask our Author as to his
Religion. I shall proceed now, to examine his Politicks; and
I think, he will discover himself more plainly here than before.</P>
<P>I am not very much concern'd to debate, whether the Au∣thor
of the <HI>State Memorial</HI> has given him the Advantage he
pretends to, or no, in his Partiality, with respect to the Mini∣stry
of the late Reign, and the present Ministry of this.</P>
<Q><HI>Any Body would be glad to know, who he means, when he
turns the Tables, and says,</HI> p. 8. l. 16. <HI>That</HI> those Gentlemen
gain'd a great deal of Honour for their Endeavours, to preserve to us
the Protestant Religion, together with our Rights and Liberties, entire;
when others, who have succeeded them in the same Posts, have done all
that lay in their Power, to root up the very Foundation of Property and
true Religion.</Q>
<P>If he means the present Ministry, he cannot be right, be∣cause
these did not immediately succeed those he is talking of;
<PB N="14" REF="12"/>
if he means the last, let them answer it that think them∣selves
concern'd.</P>
<P>'Tis plain he means one of them, by the next Words, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<Q>I would not be thought to detract from the good Qualifications of any,
whom Her Majesty has thought fit to Employ in the Administration
of Affairs.</Q>
<P>I omit interrupting him in his <HI>Panegyrick upon the Reign and
Ministry of King William;</HI> tho' his Design of Embroiling the
Gentlement of that Time, with those of this Reign, which he
treats with the Scandalous Term of <HI>Conspirators, p.</HI> 11. a Ca∣lumny
not worth enquiring into, is very Conspicuous.</P>
<P>Nor shall I examine here, the already Thorowly-debated
Point of Disbanding the Army; neither is it material, since 'tis
very possible, that two Persons may act in differing Measures
from the same honest Principle of the Publick Good.</P>
<P>But all these Instances, 'tis plain, are reviv'd, not so much
to defend the Ministry of those Gentlemen, whose Actions
need none of his Oratory to defend them, as to render odious
the present Ministry, upon whom he all along pretends to thro'
the Burthen of every Disappointment in the last Reign, fre∣quently
treats them as Traytors to the Publick, and <HI>Conspiring
against the Welfare and Happiness of their Country,</HI> p. 10. l. 22.
p. 12. l. 30.</P>
<P>And I cannot but observe here, that in the last of these re∣cited
Places, he brings a most Notable Proof of these Gentle∣men
that are now in the Ministry, conspiring against the Safe∣ty
of the Common-wealth in the last, <HI>viz.</HI> That these Gentle∣men
brought in the Bill, <HI>for Regulating Tryals in Cases of
Treason.</HI></P>
<P>The weighty Reason he gives for this Charge, is very Re∣markable,
<HI>viz.</HI> They hop'd they might carry on their Contri∣vances
and Machinations with greater Success and Security.</P>
<P>Now, certainly these were the first Men, who, resolving to
be Traytors, promoted Laws to procure fair Tryals; Men of
Guilt seldom move, to have the Proceedings againdt them Re∣gulated;
and that this Occult Project was true, is very uncer∣tain,
and the Suggestion very presumptive, as it is really ve∣ry
improbable.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="13"/>
A Judgment of Common Charity would rather conclude
that a Care of Posterity, least being sworn into Plots they were
innocent of, they should be hurry'd out of their Lives upon
slight Evidence, Innuendoes, and suggested Crimes, mov'd their
proposing such a Law; and the Proof, that none of these Con∣spirators,
as he vilely calls them, have ever since had occasion
of those Laws, ought, one would think, to have guarded their
Repuration from such a scandalous <HI>Innuendo.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this Author less <HI>Sarcastick,</HI> even upon the Gentlemen
he would defend, and thereby plainly shows, how all along he
mingles the Gall with the Liquid; when applauding their op∣posing
this Law, he tells us, <HI>p.</HI> 13, it was <HI>their Zeal for the
Safety of the King;</HI> as if those Gentlemen, or the King Him∣self
either, drove at the Royal Safety, by the little Illegal Pra∣ctises
of the Law, by which so many had been hurry'd out of
the World, in the former Reigns, and were afraid to give Cri∣minals
Fair and Regulated Tryals for their Lives.</P>
<P>Thus, first, he Charges Honest Gentlemen, opposing a good
Law, with design to preserve the King, and these Gentlemen,
bringing in this Good Law, with design to betray him.</P>
<P>The Malice of this is so gross, and the Covering so thin; that,
I think, I need say no more to Expose it; and the Breach he
would fain make here, can never take Effect, because all Men
know, that Law did take Effect; the King was not betray'd
by it; Traytors and Assassinators were brought to condign
Punishment by Fair and Legal Process; and without doubt,
Treason will be as well punish't by fair Proceedings, as by
Tricks and Advantages of Law, since we always find those
Advantages us'd more against Innocent Men, than Guilty.</P>
<P>Fair Proof lies hardest upon Men of Guilt; 'tis when Evil
Governments have a Mind to hook Men into Snares, that they
frame Points, make Constructive Judgments, and hurry Men
out of the World by Imperfect Methods.</P>
<P>Such as these, neither the King, nor that Ministry, could
be capable of desiring; it was below His Majesty to desire it;
they were some of the very Tyrannies he came hither to Abo∣lish<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;
and no Man, Acting under His Majesty, could be sup∣posed
to have such Designs.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="14"/>
But 'tis still more Ridiculous, that Men should push at Laws,
for fair, legal, and unbyass'd Justice, that expected to Merit,
being brought upon the Stage of that Justice.</P>
<P>But such are the Shifts and Difficulties, thro' which our Au∣thor
must bring his Charge against the present Ministry; and
such wrethed Arguments he is driven to, to prove these Gen∣tlemen
Conspirators; because when they were to be taken,
they desir'd to be try'd fairly, it seem'd rather to be, that
they apprehended they should be, one time or other, thus bar∣barously
us'd; and therefore resolv'd to proceed so, that when∣ever
it happen'd, they might have fair Play for their Lives.</P>
<P>From this he goes on to the Case of the Gentlemen, who
still suffer under the Suspension of the <HI>Habeas Corpus</HI> Act, which
I cannot but understand, to be meant as a Satyr upon the
King, and upon the Management of that Time: At the same
time that he is pretending to defend it, if he would have it be
otherwise understood, what need of his repeating, that it was
never done before, but in favour to the King.</P>
<P>As if he had said, that suspending of the Law was done in
favour of so extraordinary a Person as King <HI>William.</HI> In what
was King <HI>William</HI> extraordinary as to this Case, but in this
that he declar'd against Dispensing Power, which was after∣wards
practised the first time upon his particular account.</P>
<P>Now had this Gentleman gone on to tell us on whose ac∣count,
and at whose motion this Suspension was continued,
even after the King who was that only Person concern'd was
dead, he might have clear'd up the matter and shown us
some People that were willing to preserve the Example, who
can never be reproach'd with too much respect for King
<HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>The suspending this Law therefore out of a tender regard to
the Safety of this Prince, must be a Banter, since 'tis suspended
still, and the Persons kept confin'd to this day, how justly I will
not determine, tho' that Prince has been dead so many Years.</P>
<P>I shall trace him no farther thro' these Parts, in which
he keeps up the Panegyrick iu Masquerade; I freely joyn
with him in Recording the Memory of those Gentlemen,
whose peculiar Glory it is, that they are so true to the Ge∣neral
<PB N="13" REF="15"/>
Good of their Native Country, and so satisfied of its
being honestly aud earnestly pursu'd by the present Ministry,
that they openly concur in, Approve of, and Defend the pre∣sent
Management; <HI>and thereby prove,</HI> that there is some∣thing
else in some Peoples Designs, than barely striving to
get into Places.</P>
<P>From these Matters our Author descends to the Stage of
Publick Action, where you have him entirely discover'd and
the Mask thrown off, the whole Design appears naked, and
he shews himself one of the New-modell'd Party, who are
Erecting a third Sort of Division in <HI>England</HI> as we saw late∣ly
in <HI>Poland.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen has made Use of but two Sorts of Men in the
Administration, and this New Party pretends to like none of
them; and to bring their Designs to a Head, the Founda∣tion
is laid in Defamations, Decrying the best Actions and
Branding the best Endeavours to serve our Country, and these
rallied together are all thrown upon the present Ministry.</P>
<P>All Men that have their Eyes in their Heads, see plainly the
present Design is to run upon the Ministry with Clamour
and Raillery, to throw Dirt at them and their Actions by
all possible Methods of Rudeness and Indecency, Pamphlets,
Speeches and Opprobrious Terms, and the Author of this
has made, <HI>I think,</HI> the Tenth Essay that Way, I mean in
Publick; and I think, I need not go back to Speeches, Vin∣dication
of Speeches, Memorials, Sermons, and the various
Subsequent Libells of the last three Months to enumerate
the rest.</P>
<P>But for the present Gentleman he has indeed by a pecu∣liar
Method of his own, thrown off the Vail of good Lan∣guage
from his Stile, and falls upon them with an un-re∣strain'd
Fury, his Arguments are all Positives, and the Con∣struction,
Meer Calling Rogue and Rascal without any to∣lerable
Colour either of Reason or Argument.</P>
<P>And first he begins, P. 17. with the Queen, he tells you,
<HI>He has some Reason to hope the War may terminate to our Ho∣nour:</HI>
and he is the more encourag'd to think so, because
<PB N="10" REF="16"/>
<HI>Her Majesty</HI> in Her <HI>Gracious</HI> and <HI>Glorious</HI> Speech has in a
<HI>Manner</HI> assur'd us, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I am not willing to strain any Man's Meaning, and con∣demn
him for thinking, but all People ought to have Sence
enough to see when they are banter'd; as to his Epithet
of <HI>Glorious</HI> to a Speech, I shall say little to it, but tell you
a Story; I have heard of a Brave Honest Fisherman of <HI>Pool</HI>
who when for more Courage than Brains, he was advanc'd,
to the Command of a Man of War, saluted the Admiral al∣ways
with the Title of Your <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory;</HI> Now he
that concludes any Thing from hence, but that either the
Admiral was banter'd, or the Captain a Blockhead, must
see further into it than I; and the poor Captain was call'd
<HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> for it as long as he liv'd: 'Tis plain we
must not call our Author Blockhead: what follows is as plain,
when he tells us of <HI>a Glorious Speech,</HI> I think, I under∣derstand
him right, and he wou'd have it pass for a Glo∣rious
Banter, as to the <HI>Manners of it</HI> I leave that to the
Author: The Words following add something to the Ju∣stice
of this Opinion here, The Queen <HI>has in a Manner as∣sur'd
us</HI> (says he P, 17.) or after a Fashion. -—Now if
we wou'd examine Her Majesty's Speech, I think 'tis plain
the Reasons are laid down, why the Queen thought the
Prospect laid before Her People hopeful and promising;
and therefore to say <HI>It was Assuring them IN A MANNER,</HI>
can be nothing bnt putting a Jest upon the Queen, which
I leave him to defend by himself.</P>
<P><HI>In this Paragraph</HI> every Line is mixt with these <HI>Sarcasms,</HI>
under a pretended <HI>Irony</HI> of Expression, and therefore, I
have thought it proper to transcribe it here as the True
Picture of its Author.</P>
<Q>I have some Reason to hope, but much more to wish that the Present
War may in a short Time terminate to our Honour and Happiness,
And I am the more encouraged to think so, because Her Majesty in Her
Gracious and GLORIOƲS Speech, has IN A MANNER assured us of
the good Posture of our Affairs, and that we shall act vigorously
in all Places upon the Offensive the next Campaign. Besides the
<PB N="11" REF="17"/>
Consideration of our Publick Money's being well husbanded, and
dispos'd of to the best Advantage, together with the known Cou∣rage
and Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> which was shewn
in that Memorable Victory obtained against the <HI>French</HI> at <HI>Blen∣heim,</HI>
will not suffer me to give an Entire Credit to those invidi∣ous
Reports which are spread about the Town, to the great Dispa∣ragement
of our Ministry, by some discontented, tho' well-affected
Friends to the Government. And yet at the same Time, I must
say, that if I knew well how to answer them, I should not be so
uneasie to hear them.</Q>
<P>Here you have a very brief Acknowledgment of my
Lord Treasurer's Just Prudence and Punctual Discharge, to
which we have nothing subjoin'd; it being, <HI>First,</HI> true, that
the worst Enemies of <HI>that Great Man</HI> cannot suggest any
thing against it, and so <HI>they cannot make the Dirt stick there:</HI> And
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Because 'tis the full Design here if possible, to sup∣pose
a Division between those accus'd and those acquitted
in the Ministry.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> is next brought in with an En∣comium
on his Courage and Conduct, but least we should
not see <HI>the Ghost</HI> thro' this <HI>Winding Sheet,</HI> 'tis left open in
the very Front, the Courage and Conduct of the Duke is
confin'd to the Action of <HI>Blenheim.</HI></P>
<P>And shall I enquire of this Gentleman some Particulars
here; Was the Courage and Conduct of that Glorious Prince
<HI>no where shewn</HI> but at <HI>Blenheim?</HI> Had this Author said, <HI>more
particularly shewn at the Battle of Blenheim,</HI> he might have been
excus'd; but 'tis plain, this is spoken with an Emphasis at
the same time, detracting from the Merit of his former, and
other Actions.</P>
<P>Without doubt, the Anticedents to that Glorious Relative,
had as much, of both the Courage and Conduct of the Duke
in them, as the Action it self; the first concerting that pro∣digious
March, the amusing the <HI>French</HI> with the Uncertainty,
where the Storm would fall, and so preventing their
quitting the Country about <HI>Landau,</HI> to Reinforce the <HI>Mare∣schall
Tallard,</HI> least a suddain Countermarch should snatch that
Valuable Conquest from them, and open a Door to insult the
very Frontiers of <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="18"/>
After this, the Celerity of the March, the Iufluencing the
<HI>German</HI> Affairs to a Promptness unusual in those Princes,
the Passing by the Strong Encampment of the <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Bavarians,</HI> and Falling in upon the Impracticable Post of
<HI>Schellemberg,</HI> a Place that had been 14 Several Times Assault∣ed
in vain, and never was carry'd, but by that Invincible O∣riginal
of Fighting <HI>Gustavus Adolphus;</HI> to whose Character, no
Man in <HI>Germany</HI> ever came nearer, than this Second, both in
Courage and Success; and I make no Difficulty to say, That
the Attack at <HI>Schellenberg,</HI> as it first gave the Enemy a Taste
of what they were to Expect, as it was an Attack upon the
Flower of their Troops, and in an Impregnable Post of Ad∣vantage,
the Courage and Conduct of the Duke was more
Conspicuous in that Action, than in the Fight at <HI>Blenhiem,</HI> tho'
the Consequence and Glory of the last reach'd farther; for
Actions are not always Truly Great in their Consequences,
that are so in their Management.</P>
<P>From this Instance, I crave leave, previous to this Author's
Clamour, to ask, Whether the General Conduct of the War,
(let particular Actions speak for themselves) does not Confirm
the Conduct, and consequently the Glory of the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough,</HI>
beyond all the little Reproaches of Cavilling and
Detracting Men, who Envy and Malign the Honours, the
whole World pays to his Merit?</P>
<P>To explain what I mean by this, I desire all considering Peo∣ple
to examine, how the State of the War appears? How the
whole Form of its Management has receiv'd a General Turn
in <HI>Europe,</HI> by the Conduct of this One Man we would defame?</P>
<P>King <HI>William</HI>'s Glory no Man will dispute, and even
his Enemies acknowledge; yet almost all his Reign, even
back to the first of these Wars <HI>France</HI> gave Measures to all
<HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The Business of the Generals was to keep their Eyes up∣on
the Motions of the <HI>French,</HI> the Secrecy and Celerity of
their Actions were the just Subject of our Watchfulness and
Admiration, and you were to be strong or weak here or
there, as they were expected to make their Efforts; the Con∣federates
follow'd, but <HI>France</HI> always led.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="19"/>
Was the Seat of the War to be in <HI>Ireland?</HI> It was because the
<HI>French</HI> Forces were sent thither, and King <HI>James</HI>'s Army there
before you. Did you raise Forces under Young <HI>Scombergh,</HI>
and bring a <HI>German</HI> Army into <HI>Italy?</HI> It was not to carry the
War into <HI>Italy,</HI> but because the King of <HI>France</HI> was there be∣fore
you.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this War, he seiz'd every Appendice of
the <HI>Spanish</HI> Monarchy; you were oblig'd to follow him, not
lead him every where; even in <HI>Italy,</HI> tho' the <HI>Germans</HI> had not
the 4th Part of the Way to March, they found the <HI>French</HI> up∣on
the Banks of the <HI>Adige,</HI> and possess'd of the Strong Pass at
<HI>Roveredo</HI> before them; and had the <HI>Germans</HI> been Commanded
by any Man but Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> (whom no Difficulty could
resist) perhaps they had never got into <HI>Italy</HI> at all.</P>
<P>The King, who was as good a Judge of the Men, fit to car∣ry
on the War, as of the War it self, recommended this Ge∣neral,
and gave him that Character which his Grace has Effe∣ctually
made good: And now, let any Man but view the Face
of the War, in the Management of this General.</P>
<P>You are no more concern'd, to enquire what Steps the <HI>French</HI>
take; but you have turn'd the Tables, and they take their
Measures from you; you are not to examine into their Coun∣cils,
or follow their Motions, <HI>BƲT THEY YOƲRS;</HI> the Secre∣cy
or Celerity of their Motions, does not now alarm you so
much as it us'd to do; for they are oblig'd now to wait as you
us'd to do, to see where the Gathering Cluds of their Enemies
will break.</P>
<P>The Effects of this are plain; you have divided their For∣ces
in so many Parts, they cannot get into the Field before you,
and secure their Summer's Work before-hand, and so cut you
out the Labour of a Campaign, before you get into the Field;
but you lead them into the Field, as well as tell them, where
it shall be; you are there before them, and they follow you to
Action, not knowing where to begin. The Advantages of
this Turn of Affairs, are too many for any Man that is not
wilfully blind, not to see them.</P>
<P>This gave you the Victory at <HI>Blenheim,</HI> while the <HI>French</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="20"/>
Army on the Upper Rhine, could neither Oppose, nor Divert
you, nor durst go into <HI>Bavaria</HI> before you; this gave you the
Rich Plunder of <HI>Port St. Mary,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leet,</HI> the Town of
<HI>Gibralter,</HI> and the Conquests of <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alonia,</HI> while your Enemies,
not knowing where the Storm would fall, are put to the
Trouble now, not to lead, but follow; and to the Discourage∣ment,
not of defending, but regaining Conquests.</P>
<P>Where-ever you turn, they are oblig'd to come after; when
they March to the <HI>Moselle,</HI> they are call'd back into <HI>Brabant;</HI>
to Day they are Insulting <HI>Leige;</HI> to Morrow cannot Defend
their Lines; your Conquests in <HI>Alsace</HI> summon 'em to the Up∣per
Rhine, from thence to <HI>Rousillion.</HI></P>
<P>If they March from <HI>Portugal</HI> to <HI>Arragon,</HI> they are call'd a∣way
to <HI>Valentia;</HI> fresh Invasions summons 'em back to <HI>Anda∣lusia,</HI>
and the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal:</HI> And thus you harrass 'em
with various Scenes of Action, that formerly made the Seat of
War, where they pleas'd to be the Aggressors.</P>
<P>Now you carry the War into their own Country, which
they always (till now) carry'd on in yours; they expect you
on the Frontiers of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and find you in <HI>Catalonia;</HI> and
they must Traverse whole <HI>Spain,</HI> to wait for you on the Fron∣tiers
of the Kingdom of <HI>Arragon.</HI></P>
<P>They expect to sit down before <HI>Turin,</HI> but are summon'd
back to the Frontiers of <HI>Milan,</HI> to Fight the Troops this Great
and Politick General concerted last Year in the Court of
<HI>Berlin.</HI></P>
<P>And to whom is this Turn of Affairs owing? Who is the
Helm of the War? Who concerts in the Congress of Great
Designs, all the Invasions and Attacks upon the Enemy, and
the Places and Seasons of Action? Who negotiates in Winter,
the Operations of the Summer? Who is the Man that has re∣mov'd
the Difficulty at the Courts of <HI>Berlin</HI> and <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI>
which obstructed the March of Succours to <HI>Italy?</HI> That recon∣ciles
the Clashing Interests of Princes, and conquers the Scru∣ples
and Difficulties of Jarring Courts, that brings them to
wave Niceties, and abate Ceremonies for the Publick Good,
spurs on the sleeping Princes to Action, and prevents their be∣ing
doz'd with the Golden <HI>Opiats</HI> of <HI>France?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="21"/>
Let us look back to the Frontiers; Has there been no Con∣duct
in the Conquests of <HI>Spanish Guelderland,</HI> the Province of
<HI>Limbough,</HI> and the Principality of <HI>Leige?</HI> Why did not the Su∣perior
<HI>French</HI> bring you back from the <HI>Danube,</HI> to defend <HI>Mae∣strich't</HI>
that Year, as he did from the <HI>Moselle</HI> this Year, to save
the Cittadel of <HI>Leige?</HI></P>
<P>Must all these Things be laid asleep in the Grave of Envy,
and the Conduct of a Man that <HI>England</HI> retrieves her Honour
by, be blacken'd by Suggestions and Surmises? who will ever
venture to serve a Nation that would thus requite his Hazards,
and attempt to blacken his Conduct amidst Universal Successes?</P>
<P>I come next to exaamine the Little and Forg'd Allegations
that are set as a Balance against a most Rising Glory, and
that some People think, are sufficient to justify their being un∣grateful
to the Deliverers of their Country; and here let us see
with what Industry Trifles are magnify'd; and Defect of Sub∣stance,
supply'd with Forgery, Surmise and unfair Suggestion:
To such Exigence, was the Author of this Calumny reduc'd,
that he makes no Scruple to intrench upon his own Morals,
and supply his Design with Slander and Falshood?</P>
<P>I am sorry a Man of his Cloath should forget, that <HI>Truth is
a Moral Vertue,</HI> which no honest Man can forsake, and all Men
of Honour think themselves bound to act by; and that when
he advanc'd what is so obvious to every Man's Understanding,
he could not but expect to be answer'd to his Disadvantage;
and that the Project being detected, would infallibly fix such
a Scandal on his Sincerity, that no Man who regarded his Cha∣racter,
could be easy under.</P>
<P>The first Thing this Man of Politicks goes upon, is to Re∣proach
a Noble Peer, in his Speech in the House of Lords,
which he calls an <HI>Anniversary,</HI> with ignorantly laying the Blame
of our Miscarriage last Year on our Confederates, which this
Gentleman will remove from them, to the Duke of <HI>Marl∣borough.</HI></P>
<P>As to his Quotation of my Lord <HI>H—shams,</HI> I leave him
to his Lordship's Resentments; but his fixing the Matter on
the Duke, is infinitely absurd; as will appear in the Particu∣lars
following.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22"/>
<HI>1st.</HI> He reckons up a Great Number of Misfortunes that hap∣pen'd
last Year to the Confederates. As,</P>
<Q><P>That the <HI>French,</HI> who were broken, and distracted in their Measures, have
thereupon re-assum'd their Courage, aud have had the Confidence to
rally, and defy us; that the secret Designs and Negotiations the <HI>French</HI>
Agents have been this Winter carrying on among the Northern Princes,
and the Measures that have been concerted in those Parts to break the
Confederacy, by raising Disputes and Quarrels among themselves, and
so necessitating them to withdraw their Troops from the Common Ser∣vice,
is, as they say, owing to the same Mismanagement.</P>
<P>The Business of <HI>Lubec,</HI> the Difference between the States of <HI>Holland</HI>
and the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and that Prince's Design of sending Succour
to the <HI>Swede;</HI> the Insurrections in <HI>Bavaria,</HI> the Success of the <HI>Male-contents</HI>
in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and the Straits and Difficulties of Prince <HI>Eu∣gene,</HI>
are all put by these People to the same Score.</P></Q>
<P>2. He lays all this to the Duke's Charge, in his Retreat from
the <HI>Moselle;</HI> as follows.</P>
<Q><P>None of which would, or could have happen'd, if we had stuck to our first
Scheme; which could not have fail'd of putting a Glorious End to the
War, if we had pursued the Design Capitulated with our Confederates,
and maintained our Post instead of that precipitate Retreat, or rather
Flight from the <HI>Moselle,</HI> towards the <HI>Maese</HI> and <HI>Sambre.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And, to prove this was the Duke's particular Fault, he tells us,
p.</HI> 19. That the Blame laid on Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was without Ground,
That part of the <HI>German</HI> Army had actually join'd us, and the rest
were marching towards us with all Convenient Expedition, and that
they were never known to be earlier in the Field than at that time;
That we our selves were able to have kept our Ground as least against
the <HI>French</HI> Army, till the rest had come up, and that we had plentiful
Magazines at <HI>Treves</HI> to supply us, which made our Desertion so much
the more Ʋnaccountable.</P>
<P><HI>And all this is confirm'd,</HI> (1.) Because the Dyet of the Empire found
no fault in Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Conduct, but immediately made him <HI>Gene∣ralissimo</HI>
of all their Forces; and (2.) Because afterwards when <HI>Mar∣shall
Villars</HI> attempted the Lines at <HI>Lauterburgh,</HI> Reinforcements
were sent to <HI>Count Thungen,</HI> from the <HI>Moselle.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="21" REF="23"/>
Before I go on with this Rapsody of a Charge, which he
brings in as a Discourse of other Peoples, let me consider how
faintly he brings himself in, opposing these Allegations; and
as he that desends an Argument Ill, gives it up; let me tell
this Gentleman, what he might have said to contradict these
Suggestions, if they had not been of his own contriving, and
how easily have confuted them.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> His Innumeration of the Disadvantages of the last
Campaign are wrong stated, false in Fact, or maliciously
strain'd, to serve the turn of Slander, for which they are; tho'
very weakly calculated.</P>
<P><HI>1st.</HI> It appears the <HI>French</HI> were not broken, and distracted
in their Measures, but settl'd, ready, and sedately resolv'd
what to do; and this appears, in that they never offer'd to
make Detachments from the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> where they had fix'd
their Measures: It appears they knew the <HI>Germans</HI> were not in
a Condition to hurt them, and that on the other hand, they
were in a Condition to expect the worst the Duke's Forces
could do without them; of which more presently.</P>
<P><HI>2d.</HI> The Designs and Negotiations of the <HI>French</HI> to break the
Confederacy, by raising Disputes, and obliging the Northern
Princes to withdraw their Troops, are so far an Argument a∣gainst,
that they raise the Glory of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI>
on a double Account; First, In that, if they had conceiv'd
Hopes of them from the Disappointment on the <HI>Moselle,</HI> the
Advantage did not prove sufficient to enable them to finish
those Designs: Secondly, The Conduct of the Duke, since the
Campaign, to the Honour of his Wisdom, as the other is of
his Courage, has not only prevented their effecting those De∣signs,
but remov'd the very Causes of them, in dissolving all
the pretended Disputes and Quarrels, and Establishing a Good
Understanding among those Northern Princes, to the utter
disappointing the Expectations of a Party here, who, we see,
lye ready to TACK every Cross Event, to the Suggestions of
Mis-conduct.</P>
<P>Putting the Business of <HI>Lubeck,</HI> the Insurrection of <HI>Bavaria,</HI>
and the Success in <HI>Hungary</HI> to the same Account, are Absur∣dities
<PB N="22" REF="24"/>
too gross to need a Reply, and as they have all receiv'd
a Cheque since, are of no Moment: The Affair of <HI>Lubeck</HI>
happen'd upon the Mortality of a Person, which, as no Body
could foresee, so the same Dispute would have follow'd when∣ever
it had happen'd. The Insurrection of <HI>Bavaria</HI> was long
before concerted; but if it was hasten'd by this, it was an
Admirable Piece of Service, to delude them into a Precipitati∣on
of their Affairs, and to form that Revolt in <HI>December,</HI> when
they were certain to be immediately surrounded with all the
Forces of the Empire; which, if they had done in <HI>July</HI> be∣fore,
or delay'd to the Summer following, might have unra∣vel'd
all the Chain of Successes of the preceeding Campaign,
been fatal to the Confederacy, and made the Victory at <HI>Blen∣heim</HI>
of no Effect to us. As to the Success of the <HI>Hungarians</HI>
this last Campaign, I suppose the Author had not had an Ac∣count
of them, and spoke by guess, he never else would have
call'd Prince <HI>Ragotsky</HI>'s being beaten at <HI>Scibo,</HI> and losing all his
Footing in <HI>Transilvania,</HI> any thing like Success—but we must
bear with a great deal of such incoherent Arguing, before we
have done with a General Detractor from Universal Merit.—</P>
<P>As to the Differences between the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and the
<HI>States of Holland,</HI> and that King sending Troops to assist the
<HI>Swede,</HI> they appear meer <HI>Chimera's,</HI> coin'd at <HI>Sutton,</HI> forg'd in
a distemper'd Head, full of a New Party-Frenzy, which serve
only as Embellishments to eke out his Cause, and I leave them
as Fictions, that by the Consequence of Things, contradict
themselves, and need no Reply.</P>
<P>Now let us see his Logick.—“None of which (says he) could
have happen'd,” if we had stuck to our first Scheme. Monstrous
Absurdity! what not the Bishop of <HI>Lubeck</HI> dye, and the <HI>Hol∣steineer</HI>'s
Dispute with the <HI>Dane</HI> about the Succession? What
not the King of <HI>Prussia</HI> claim his Part in the Estate of the late
King <HI>William?</HI> Not the <HI>French</HI> Intrigue with the Northern
Princes, nor the <HI>Hungarians,</HI> have continu'd in Arms? for Suc∣cess
they have had none: None of all these Things have hap∣pen'd,
if the Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> had stood his Ground on the
<HI>Moselle!</HI> this is very strange, and if form'd into an Argument,
would hang very ill together.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="25"/>
But to come to the next Branch of his Argument, there I
shall tell him with a little more Reason, not what would not
have happen'd, but really what would. As <HI>1st. Leige,</HI> and its
whole Principality had been lost, <HI>Maestrich't</HI> besieg'd, and by
Consequence taken, the Dutch Frontiers insulted, and at the
Mercy of 60000 Men, with no Army to defend it; for all the
Insantry Monsieur <HI>Averquerque</HI> had, would not have been suf∣ficient
to have Garrison'd their Frontiers: Indeed the Diffe∣rence
between the <HI>Prussian</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and sending Troops
to joyn the <HI>Swede,</HI> might have been prevented, for they would
both have had other Work; the one, to defend his Dutchy of
<HI>Cleve;</HI> and the other, to take Care of the Capitals of their
Provinces.</P>
<P>And this leads me, to put the Case in a true Light, which
will unriddle all this Mystery, and expose the wretched Poli∣ticks
of these Men.</P>
<P>The Question is not, Whether the <HI>Germans</HI> were a coming, or
no? Or, Whether Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> was too backward? but did
they join in the Numbers concerted? Supply'd for Action,
and Time enough to enable the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> as his
Grace had concerted, to push the <HI>French</HI> with Advantage, and
to force them to alter their Measures on the <HI>Maes,</HI> and send
Detachment to the <HI>Moselle,</HI> or to enable his Grace to have
made such Detachments as should have made Monsieur <HI>Au∣verquerque</HI>
a Match for the Duke of <HI>Bavaria?</HI></P>
<P>It this was not done, 'tis nothing to us where the Fault
lay as to the present Case; but 'tis plain, the Retreat does
not lye at the Duke of <HI>Marborough</HI>'s Door, any more than
the Palatine General's abandoning <HI>Treves,</HI> and Burning the
Magazine can be laid to his Charge, which I doubt not,
had he been at his Grace's Dispose should have cost him
his Head.</P>
<P>But says this Wise Statesman, he might have stood his
Ground in Spight of the Mareschal <HI>Villars</HI> with that Army
he had; Excellent Politicks! who doubts it? And had his
Grace been touch't with <HI>French</HI> Counsels, as is afterwards
horridly suggested, he had certainly stood his Ground; and
<PB N="24" REF="26"/>
from the little Knowledge I have of the <HI>French</HI> King's Sa∣gacity,
that Prudent Monarch would have given him Four
Millions of Livres to gratifie the <HI>Root of all Evil, with
which this Gentleman reproaches him,</HI> on Condition to have staid
on the <HI>Moselle;</HI> and my Reason is short.</P>
<P>1. Because he would have rais'd trebble that Sum in
Contributious upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Prussian</HI> in the mean Time,
besides perhaps penetrating into the Bowels of their Coun∣try,
and bidding fair for their Destruction; for my Part in a
fair State of the Successes, that Army might have made on
the <HI>Dutch,</HI> with no Army in the Field to oppose them, for that
would have been the Case; I would have compounded with
them for <HI>Maestrich</HI> aud <HI>Nimeguen,</HI> and whether the Conquest
of the last would have given them Leave to have spread their
Troops by way of Contribution; I leave to the Inhabitants
of <HI>Ʋtrecht</HI> one Way, and <HI>Overyssel</HI> another Way to determine.</P>
<P>Here had been fine Work indeed, and such as I doubt
not, our Gentlemen would have been very well pleas'd with,
and the <HI>Dutch</HI> themselves soon saw this, as is plain by the
pressing Instances they made to his Grace to countermarch
and come to save them.</P>
<P>Now from this let us come to the Justice of Things, The
Duke has to his Grace's Immortal Honour, and to the Ho∣nour
of his Country, the Command of the <HI>Dutch</HI> as well as
<HI>English</HI> Army, he is <HI>their</HI> General as well as <HI>our</HI> General; would
it have been reasonable when the <HI>Dutch</HI> found themselves inva∣ded
by a powerful Enemy, and send to their own General
to bring their own Troops to their Assistance, that he should
refuse to come; would not every General Officer under him,
that had in a Council of War voted to have refus'd, been
a Traytor to his Country? Was it not their Duty and
his Duty, to take Care of that Country that paid and em∣ploy'd
them; and whose Servants they were? What wretched
Priest's Policy is this, that would have had the Duke stood
his Ground, tho' in no Condition; for Want of the <HI>Ger∣mans</HI>
Assistance to act Offensively, and suffer the <HI>Dutch</HI> to be
ruin'd and over-run, while he commanded their Army that
should defend them.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="27"/>
Farther, for the Reason of the Case, who was it fit the
Duke should Expose? The <HI>Germans</HI> who had expos'd him, and
who were not in a Condition, for want of Supplys to act; or,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> who had done their Part Honourably, parted
with their Army from Home, to joyn in concerted Measures
with their Confederates, had March'd 160 Miles, and
fac'd the Enemy, before the other were in Condition to ap∣pear.</P>
<P>Had our Author offer'd these Reasons to his pretended Ob∣jections,
he would have clear'd himself of being the Ob∣jector,
forming the Cavil first; and then pretending not
to know what to say to it; nor could he have been tax'd with
such Folly, as to pretend to be surpriz'd with an Objections, which
every Boy of ten Years old, that has but read the Account of
these Things, might have answer'd.</P>
<P>The Question is not here about Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>'s Con∣duct;
I see no Reason to object against that Prince, or why the
Diet of the Empire should not declare him <HI>Generalissimo;</HI> the
after Conduct of that Prince clears him of all Suspicion of Cor∣respondence
with the Enemy; whether Affairs on that side
would not have been mended sooner, if that Honour had been
confer'd sooner, I will not determine; but all this, let it lay
the Miscarriage where it will, serves but to assist in clearing
up the Conduct of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> which indeed re∣quires
this Vindication, more to Expose the Empty and Weak
Efforts of an Expiring Party to renew their Cause, than to
open any Body's Eyes to the Cleanness of his Character, which
is approv'd by the Confession of his worst Enemies abroad, and
the Universal Applause of all the Confederacy.</P>
<P>We have now four Pages spent in a most Labour'd Slander
upon the Duke, in the Action of <HI>Overysche,</HI> wherein this Gen∣tleman
taking quite different Steps from my Lord <HI>H—sham,</HI>
and with much more Malice, would insinuate that the Duke had
really no Intent to Fight the <HI>French</HI> at all, but to bring the
Army on pretence of Fighting, to some such Exigence as
should make the <HI>Dutch</HI> Deputies refuse to Fight, give the Duke
Cause to complain, and open the Door to a large, or more un∣limited
Command in the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="28"/>
Now tho' this is a far-fetch't, unprov'd and improbable
Suggestion, yet the following Clause is so horrid, that no∣thing
but a Spirit of Envy and Detraction can possibly form
in the Thoughts; <HI>viz.</HI> That his Grace should covet this
Command in the Army, with a Design to enable him and
countenance him, in making an advantagious Bargain with
<HI>France,</HI> by felling them a Peace, to the inconceivable Loss
and Detriment of his own Country and the Confederates.</P>
<P>This black Suggestion is so directly of the Devil, and so
maliciously inferr'd, that not the worst Enemy his Grace ever
yet had, nor the best Advocates for this Cause ever yet had Gall
enough to invent, or Front enogh to advance to the World;
and I cannot but think, 'tis Vindication enough to the Duke of
<HI>Marlborough</HI> to expose this Horrid Slander to the World.</P>
<P>To tell us, a General, who having but the last Year been
trusted with the Power of the whole Confederacy, and
commanded absolutely two of the Greatest Men in the
World, Prince <HI>Lewis</HI> of <HI>Baden</HI> and Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy;</HI>
that commanded the United Armies of the <HI>Empire, England,
Holland, Prussia,</HI> and <HI>Hessia,</HI> that having an Uncontroul'd
Power, exercis'd that Power with the Utmost Fidelity, Va∣lour
and Success against the <HI>French;</HI> should from a Prince
of such Conduct and Faithfulness, be in one Year descended
to the Meaness of a Mercenary Traytor, that seeks an Ab∣solute
Command to sell his Country to the <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P>What horrid Insinuations are these! Now let us see their Sup∣port:
No Wonder he that form'd such a Slander breaks in upon
his Truth to uphold it, and flies to a Refuge of L—s to make
it out.</P>
<P>To make this probable, the Duke is tax'd with being in
Private with his Prisoner Monsieur <HI>D' Alegre,</HI> and with
great Intimacy with <HI>Don Pedro De Ronquillo</HI> the <HI>Spaniard.</HI></P>
<P>I shall only say to these, <HI>1st.</HI> That neither of these Things
are prov'd. And, <HI>2dly.</HI> That I am credibly inform'd <HI>both
are false,</HI> and that his Grace never admitted the least Pri∣vacy
with either of these Persons, or ever discoursed them
without such Witnesses pre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent, as are more than sufficient
to vindicate his Honour against forty such Calumniators as
<PB N="27" REF="29"/>
these; and <HI>if this be so,</HI> as I have good Reason to believe,
The Wisdom and Prudence of the Duke is very conspicu∣ous,
in so happily Guarding himself against the Private and
Clandestine Attempts of Invincible Prejudice.</P>
<P>But what can secure Men of Vertue and Character from
the Blasts of Envy and Party-Malice, that in one Book, and
in the same Page, can charge him with <HI>Protracting the War,
and at the same Time designing a Clandestine Peace;</HI> the Incon∣gruity
and Inconsistency of which, is a Demonstration
of their inveterate, but ill-concerted Spleen.</P>
<P>No General, like his Grace the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> has
been so much for pushing the <HI>French</HI> to fight, as <HI>the Only
Way to deal with them,</HI> and to bring the War to a Speedy
Conclusion; and to charge a General with <HI>Protracting the
War,</HI> that is always for Fighting, is just Arguing from Contra∣ries,
and Choosing a Reason <HI>for it,</HI> that was the only Rea∣son
<HI>against it;</HI> but to such Methods they will always be
driven who attempt to oppose Demonstrations, and to ec∣clipse
the Glory that by a Channel of great Actions is illu∣strated
so many Ways, as makes it impossible to be sully'd
by Slander and Reproach.</P>
<P>But we cannot end here, his Grace is charg'd in so many
various Ways, and by so many Vulcano's and Eruptions of
this Infernal Spirit, that the most shining Actions of his Life
are pointed out as Plots against his Country; and 'tis Mat∣ter
of Wonder to me, that they did not bring the <HI>Battel
of Blenheim</HI> into the Number, as they had Publickly de∣sign'd
to do <HI>the March</HI> of the Troops unto the <HI>Danube,</HI> had not
the Success of that Battel baulk't all their Designs, and made
them <HI>asham'd to own</HI> what they Openly <HI>threaten'd him with</HI> before.</P>
<P>Generals of Armies in the common ordinary Course of
Things, when the <HI>Hurries of the Campaign,</HI> the Fatigues and
Hazards of the Field are over, and the Troops gone into
Quarters, have also <HI>their Recess,</HI> and retire to their Respe∣ctive
Courts and Countries; even Prince <HI>Eugene</HI> of <HI>Savoy,</HI> the
most Active of all the Foreign Generals of the Confederacy,
either you have him in his Head Quarters, or gone from the
Army to <HI>Vienna;</HI> all <HI>the Interval of Action</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> Generals
<PB N="28" REF="30"/>
come to the <HI>Hague,</HI> the Prince of <HI>Hesse</HI> to <HI>Cassel,</HI> and Prince <HI>Lewis</HI>
of <HI>Baden</HI> is to be found at <HI>Rastadt</HI> seven Months in the Year.</P>
<P>Nay, even the <HI>Vigilant French</HI> are found at <HI>Versailles,</HI> and no
sooner is the Campaign at a full Stop, but all the Marshals of
the several Armies are found at Court; this Practice has been
<HI>such an Establish't Custom,</HI> that the Seat of War has seldom been
so remote as to prevent it, 'till the <HI>New Turn of Affairs,</HI> of
which <HI>I noted before,</HI> that it has oblig'd the <HI>French</HI> to <HI>take their
Measures from the Confederates;</HI> has also kept the D. <HI>De Vendosme</HI>
in <HI>Italy,</HI> nay, and in <HI>the Field too,</HI> almost two Winters together.</P>
<P>But among all the Men of Action now in the World, the
Duke of <HI>Marlborough</HI> appears to be the only Man, of whom it is
to be said, <HI>He is allow'd no Rest;</HI> the Calms and Intervals of Action
are deny'd to him, the Broils of the Great Men, the Piques and
Ceremonies of Princes, the Brigues and Cabals of Parties in Fo∣reign
Courts as well as at Home, call him every Where by his
Presence and Prudence, to quench <HI>Rising Flames,</HI> prevent in
their Beginnings <HI>Trifles</HI> breaking out <HI>into Feuds,</HI> and Insignifi∣cant
Niceties interrupting the <HI>Currency</HI> of Publick Matters.</P>
<P>No sooner is the Prospect of Action over, nay, even before
the Armies are separated, he is <HI>call'd away</HI> to the remotest Angles
of <HI>the Confederacy;</HI> the General Concert of Affairs depends up∣on
him; '<HI>Tis he,</HI> that helps forward the Imperial Preparations;
<HI>By his Advice,</HI> they use Lenity instead of Rigour to the <HI>Bava∣rian
Boors,</HI> and quell an Insurrection by that Temper and Mo∣deration,
which with so much Success he had practis'd at home,
which by other Steps might have endanger'd the whole Empire.</P>
<P><HI>He prevails</HI> with the Imperial Court, even in the Midst of
Victories, to make Concessions <HI>to the Hungarians,</HI> and offer
Terms to a People obstinate in rejecting them; he engages
them to recruit, and supply their Armies in <HI>Italy</HI> too often
<HI>abandon'd,</HI> and sollicits Encouragement to a Prince, than whom
none ever better deserv'd to be supported, and who if not
now succour'd, <HI>must have</HI> quitted <HI>Italy</HI> to the superiour <HI>French.</HI></P>
<P><HI>From thence</HI> he flies to the Court of <HI>Prussia,</HI> removes Diffi∣culties,
renews Treaties, concerts Measures, disperses Jealou∣sies,
establishes Princes, and <HI>is gone</HI> before other Envoys can
have settled Preliminaries.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="31"/>
<HI>At the Hague</HI> we find him dispersing the Feuds of Princes,
regulating Quarters of Troops, that they may be at Hand
for Action, the Circles break in upon their Customs, to oblige <HI>so
Great an Intercessor. At his</HI> powerful Solicitations, the <HI>Elector Pa∣latine</HI>
parts with a whole Army for a Service, where even
the Troops themselves care not to serve.</P>
<P>Thus at <HI>Vienna,</HI> at <HI>Berlin,</HI> at <HI>Dusseldorp,</HI> in less than six Weeks
Time, he raises 20000 Men to back Prince <HI>Eugene,</HI> and ransom
the opprest Duke of <HI>Savoy</HI> from Difficulties, any Prince in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI>
but he, would have sunk under before now.</P>
<P>How many less vissible, tho' not less necessary Negotia∣tions,
were the Fruits of <HI>that Journey</HI> I leave to the Issues
of Time, only must say, that he who either by Ignorance,
<HI>which as it must be wilful is criminal;</HI> or Envy, can censure
such a Laborious, <HI>Invincible Diligence,</HI> such a Dispatch, such
a Fatigue, as an Effect of Vanity or Covetousness, must at
the same time, <HI>make a Satyr</HI> on all the Princes of <HI>Christen∣dome,</HI>
who universally pay a profound Deference to the Won∣ders
of his Conduct; and in the Respects shown him <HI>by the
Magnificence of their Presents,</HI> raise as great a Panegyrick upon
their own Justice and Discerning, as upon his Personal Merit.</P>
<P>Nor did I ever see Malice <HI>pull off its Mask so freely,</HI> as in the
Vileness and Weakness of such a Suggestion, that a Person
rais'd to such a Degree, and that has so many other Ways to
gratifie what he calls the <HI>Root of all Evil,</HI> should take a Journey
of above 2000 Miles with so Mechanick a Design, as to collect
the Bounty of several Princes, which had he carry'd no personal
Merit, but the Character of his Imployment, must have been
very doubtful in Number, and bear no Proportion in Value to
the Difficulties of the Undertaking.</P>
<P>But <HI>Malice goes always with its Mouth open,</HI> and persuing Vertue, is
never put so into Fits of Raving and Lunacy, as where the Merit of
the Object, is of a Magnitude too great to be reach'd by its utmost
Efforts; Then it grows senseless and distracted, exposes the Design, and
becomes the Contempt of the World.</P>
<P>From the Duke, we must trace him in his Chain of Slander, and
see him Unman himself to fall upon the Sex, and Madam the Dutchess
in very good Company, no less than the Queen Herself, must stand the
Dirt of his Pen; to which I shall say nothing but this, <HI>Fye, fye,
Mr.</HI> Stephens, MEDDLE WITH THE WOMEN! <HI>that should have
been below your Breeding, and the Behaviour very much disgraces your.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="32"/>
Now we find this Gentleman removing his Attack, and the next
Man of Merit he falls upon, is Mr. <HI>Secretary Harley;</HI> and tho' in
Truth, he has the Misfortune to find <HI>nothing to his Purpose here,</HI> yet
there never shall be a Case, where a Man in such a Design shall have
<HI>nothing to say;</HI> whether to his own purpose, or to his Adversarys;
and I cannot but observe here, how naturally the very Methods
he has taken to blacken this Gentleman, if he could, even by his own
way of Arguing; is the best Vindication any Man could have made
for him in such a Case.</P>
<P>The first Charge against this Gentleman is, that <HI>the Memorial took
no Notice of him</HI> from whence this Author advances, that they were
sure of his Friendship, and he must, one time or other, be of a Party
with them, because they had not disoblig'd him.</P>
<P>This is both a Barbarous, and a Ridiculous way of Arguing; it
had been much more honest and fair to conclude, that because they
said nothing, <HI>they had nothing to say;</HI> since that warm Libel miss'd no
Body they could form any thing against, tho' much higher and lower
than this Gentleman.</P>
<P>Had he happen'd to say, they car'd not to bring to Remem∣brance,
the Man, who having out-shot them in their own Bow, had
push'd them upon those Follies and Extravagances, which at the same
time that they ruin'd their Cause, expos'd their Politicks, turn'd 'em
off the Stage, and made Fools of 'em too.</P>
<P>Had he happen'd to say, that Great States-man handed them
on to their Occasional Bills, Tackings, Dangerous Experiments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and seeing beyond their Reach, drove them like <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Fool,
to the Correction of the Stocks, and made their Fu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y their De∣struction?</P>
<P>These
had been fairer Suggestions for their saying nothing of him in
the Memorial, than any this Author makes, and may be subjoyn'd to a
great many more, which are as useful in the Consequence as the Moral.</P>
<P>Why else do these Gentlemen complain of being betray'd, and that
he has betray'd both Partys; that he has not betray'd the Whigs, the
Consequence, and his present Services demonstrate; but pray Gen∣tlemen
what did he betray you in?</P>
<P>Was it, that when he had prevail'd upon you to do your Duty, <HI>viz.</HI>
to recognize the Rites of the People, which you comply'd with, not
by Inclination, but as you thought it was an insulting your Prince;
when you afterwards address'd the Queen to extend Her Prerogative,
he would not follow;—Was it, that when you thought him your
own, and expected him to joyn in betraying your Country, invading
the Rights of the People, and persecuting the Dissenters, he refus'd
you? If these are the Betrayings of the Party, we are content; if not,
it had been infinitely obliging, as well as just, if this Gentleman had
told us in what he betray'd them.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="33"/>
As to the other Party, how are they betray'd? We find him in the
Ministry and the Dissenters safe, their Toleration secur'd, their Li∣berties
unbroken, and the whole Party easy; how are they betray'd?</P>
<P>But he has betray'd those Persons that trusted him with their Complaints,
against some of the Chief Ministers, by his Faint and Partial Attacks.</P>
<P>This is a Dark Saying, <HI>1st.</HI> It remains unprov'd, that their Com∣plaints
would bear more warm Attacks, for weak and trifling Accu∣sations
are no Novelties in this Age; and if all Men are betray'd,
whose frivolous Charges are not vigorously push'd on, according to
the warmth of their own misguided Passions? All wise Men must be∣tray
some people of every Party.</P>
<P>These are the Extreams he hated of every side, and so I come to my
Author again.</P>
<P>This Gentleman <HI>always hated the Extreams of all Partys,</HI> and there∣fore
says our Author, is <HI>extreamly hated of all Partys.</HI>—</P>
<P>And so shall every Man be hated that opposes the Extreams of Par∣tys,
and yet these <HI>Extreams of all Partys</HI> are the only Things dange∣rous
to this Nation's Prosperity; the High-flying mad Men of the
Age hate this Gentleman no doubt of it, and so they do every wise
and honest Men besides; and a wise Man <HI>would be hated by such;</HI> for to
what end can a Man desire to be valu'd by the Enemies of his Country?</P>
<P>This therefore, that our Author designs as a Satyr upon this Gen∣tleman,
is really the Greatest Panegyrick upon his Conduct that could
have been made; and no Man that will pursue the Interest of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
unbyass'd by Partys, but shall in their turn be hated, censur'd
and abandon'd by all Partys.</P>
<P>Had Mr. <HI>Stephens</HI> descended to Particulars with this Gentleman,
and told the World when any thing for the publick Good, for
the Peoples Liberties, for the National Interest, was opposed by
him, then it indeed might have been needful to have examin'd his
Character, in order to vindicate him; but if every Law for the
publick Good, if Tolerations, if Acts of Securities, Abjurations,
and Settlements, if Protestant Succession, if Recognition of Rights
of the People, if all these have had his Affirmatives, if all your
Dangerous Experiments, Occasional Bills, Tackings, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> owe their
Destruction to his Conduct, I would have all Men of Conduct
and Justice, consider before they venture to mistake, and censure
their Friends among their Enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Partys in</HI> England <HI>are not always pleas'd when they are serv'd,</HI>
and unless they are serv'd their own way, <HI>vvhich may be some∣times
to their Ruine,</HI> they will not be convinc'd they <HI>vvere serv'd
at all:</HI> Providence it self, takes such Measures frequently in his
Government of this World, to bring about the greatest Delive∣verances
to a Nation; and we need not go far back, to remem∣ber

how we thought our selves entirely ruin'd in the late Reign,
under the Fears of Popery and Arbitrary Power,—what Cen∣sures,

<P>Tis very hard, that he must make a Sacrifice of his Common
Reputation, that will serve such a People as we are; had not
somebody led a party by the -—into <HI>the Wilderness of the Na∣tions

<HI>never after pull down;</HI> they had not Governed the State in such a
Confused manner when they came into the Chair, but they found
themselves so hamper'd with Laws, <HI>and some of them of their own
making too,</HI> that it put them out of their Measures, drove them to
Distractions, and State Lunacies, 'till the Queen was forc't to dis∣miss
them from the publick Administration, to save us all from
a general Shipwrack; and what the Consequence will be, any body
may guess at; they hate the Instrument that drew them in to be
honest, and got them to <HI>lock the Door</HI> so fast against Tyrannick
Excursions, that when they had the <HI>Key in their own Hands,</HI> they
found it Overshot, and could never open it but by the <HI>Hammers

the People, they cryed <HI>Thieves;</HI> and wak'd the Queen. The
Rogues were turn'd out of Doors, and all has been quiet since.</P>
<P>Imediately came Invectives, Lampoons, Sermons, Memorials,
Letters, and Inumerable Pamphlets, to Cry out upon the Queen,
and Her Ministry, for turning these State <HI>Thieves</HI> out of Doors and
taking honester Men in; and why should this be strange to us,
It has ever been so in all Ages; <HI>when honest men Rule, Knaves are

<P>These must be sometimes taken Notice of, not only that they
may not be Wise in their own Conceit, but that they may not
deceive other Weak Men like themselves, and bring Snares
upon honest People, whose want of Meaning subjects them to
the Subtilties of a Party, and prompts them to do Ignorantly
the Mischief they would avoid.</P>
<P>These Sheets then, while they seem to clear up the Aspersi∣ons
cast upon the Dignity and Honour of Her Majesty's most
Faithful Servants, and the Nation's Best Friends, are not to
signify, that your Actions want the poor Efforts of Words and
Arguments, to explain or defend them, but to remove all those
<PB N="2" REF="36"/>
Clouds and Coverings, that the false Glosses, cunning <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
and malicious Suggestions of designing Men, have
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> over the Judgments, and discerning Faculties of the Ig∣no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt.</P>
<P>Your Actions stand in need of no Vindications; and if any
Mis-understanding is to be found in the Nation concerning you,
'tis occasion'd by the wilful Darkness of their Judgments, who
resist Demonstrations: True Merit (like a handsome Face) re∣quires
no Aid from the Painter's flattering Colours, it only
wants him to show his Skill in making it a true Likeness: To
Write Panegyricks on your Management, requires the Histo∣rian,
not the Poet; a Faithful Relator, not a Flourishing Ora∣tor;
and therefore the humble Author covets, in these Sheets, to
set your Actions in a true Light, that they may be seen as they
are; than which no greater Honour can be done you, nor a
greater Kindness to the Reader, since 'tis enough to compleat
the Glory of your Families, to have Posterity know you as
you really are, unsully'd with the Dirt of Envy, or undaub'd
with the Oyl of Praise.</P>
<P>But the Reason of this Address (at the Conclusion of these
Sheets) is to be found more particularly in an Humble Zeal of
their Author, for the Publick Good; and if that Zeal prompts
him to an Officious Application to your Honours, which
may seem too singular, he humbly asks your Pardon,
since he presumes there are no sincere Protestants in this Nati∣on
that are sensible of the true State of our Affairs, but will
joyn in a most Humble Address to your Honours, that you
would not lay this Sin to the Nation's Charge; and that you
would not be discourag'd by the ill Treatment you find from
a Thankless and Ungrateful Generation, nor provok'd by the
Unkindness of the Times, to cease the Vigilent Persuit of the
Nation's Safety, and the Queen's Glory.</P>
<P>The Protestant Religion, <HI>may it please your Honours,</HI> and the
Numerous. Throng of worthy Professors of it, either in the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> or otherwise; the Queen, a Glorious Mi∣stress,
that the best Men think it an Honour to serve▪ The far
greater Part, and by much the most Illustrious of the Nobili∣ty:
<PB N="3" REF="37"/>
The Gentry, <HI>a few; poyson'd with Party-Prejudice <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI>
Universally the common People untainted with the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
of Party-Strife, have no hand in these Calumnies.</P>
<P>Nor is the Church of <HI>England,</HI> however unhappily some of
her Clergy are tainted with the Mischief of Party-Manage∣ment,
or however one of her Clergy has been drawn in, to dip
his weak Pen in Slander and Reproach, and to suffer himself to
personate what, 'tis but too plain, was not his own Design;
—The Church therefore as such, has no hand in these Follies,
and still solicites your Honours for your Powerful Patronage a∣gainst
foreign Invasion of Popery, French Government, Dome∣stick
Invasion of Tyranny, aud Persecution Principles.</P>
<P>Your Merit makes daily Converts among wise Men; and
they that Reason can reduce, daily submit to the Conquest of
Demonstrations. Victories abraod, Difficult Negotiations Ma∣ster'd
and Concluded, Currency of Cash, and punctual Pay∣ments
amidst a general Scarcity of Coyn, swift and faithful In∣telligence
of other's Affairs, and secret Conduct of our own:
These are Things cannot but subdue Envy it self, and reduce
even those that are unwilling to be convinc'd.</P>
<P>Let nothing therefore discourage your Honours in the faith∣ful
and vigorous Pursuit of those glorious Things you have so
happily begun, till you obtain the great End of all these Dis∣sorders
and Confusions, <HI>Truth, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Liberty:</HI> These are
the Sum of the Queen's Designs, your own Uudertakings, and
all honest Men's Desires.</P>
<P>What, tho' Malecontent <HI>Quondam</HI> Statesmen look pale and
yellow; Big, both with Envy and Jealousy, they strive to raise
Clamours, debauch ignorant unwary Members, push at di∣viding
Projects, and try all the little, low, and dishonourable
Methods, to dishonour and defame you.</P>
<P>What! tho' M—rs write Memorials, Parsons write Rail∣ing
Accusations, Divines turn Callumniators, and Tools work
their own Ruin to gratify a Party: All these Things will fall to
the Ground, and be trampl'd under the Feet of a Glory rais'd
on the true Foundation of Merit, and Zeal for the Service of
the Queen and Country.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="38"/>
The Noble Union of your Actions being built on a Truth of
Design, will never shake with the fruitless Gust of Party-Storms:
This Nation will never let such Men fall under the
Feet of Envy, whose true and successful Endeavours are con∣stantly
aim'd at the Publick Safety.</P>
<P><HI>Henry.</HI> the III<HI>d.</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> when banish'd by the Rebellious
Parisians, and treated in a most Villainous Manner by the
Clergy, and the Rabble, he sent to the K. of <HI>Navarr,</HI> to come
to his Assistance; at their first Enterview express'd himself
with great Concern at the barbarous Usage he met with, par∣ticularly
from the Clergy, to whom he had been especially ob∣liging;
The K. of <HI>Navarr</HI> reply'd, <HI>Sir, Be not concern'd, let
us March; your Majesty has nothing to do but to Conquer.</HI></P>
<P>Pardon the Allusion; your Honours have nothing to do, but
to pursue the happy Measures you have taken to reduce the E∣nemy;
do but conquer, all these Things will dye of themselves;
Malice will run her self out of Breath, if these Men could sour
your Tempers, and turn your Resolutions, cool your Zeal, and
lessen your Affections for the Publick Good, and for the Safety
of Her Majesty's Interest; they would have their End, and
would quickly find other Malecontents to Callum<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iate you,
and call you Conspirators against your Country.</P>
<P>It is therefore with a pardonable Presumption, an humble
Author ventures to say, All good Men are humble Sollicitors
to your Honours, that you would neither be discourag'd or pro∣vok'd
by these Sons of Ingratitude, that nothing may remove
you from the steady Resolutions you have hitherto pursu'd, for
the Glory of our Soveraign, the Safety of the Protestant Religi∣on,
the Prosperity of our Commerce, and the Liberty of
<HI>England.</HI></P>
