<HEAD>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE The EARL of SALISBURY, LORD CHAMBERLAIN of ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Lord Chamberlain of this kingdom is too intimately connected with the English Drama, and with every thing that relates to the character of the British Stage, to be in∣different to so gross an attack as it has sus∣tained by the late lawless attempt to break down the barrier which defends it from the disgrace with which it was overwhelmed be∣fore the present wholesome laws were framed for its regulation, and for the maintenance of its dignity, and for securing the property
<PB N="6" REF="3"/>
of its conductors. For this reason, and be∣cause it is universally known that your Lord∣ship has its true interests much at heart, I do myself the honour to inscribe the fol∣lowing pages to your Lordship. The Legi∣slature wisely foreseeing that particular cir∣cumstances might sometimes require a re∣laxation of the Laws enacted for general pur∣poses, vested in the person of the Lord Cham∣berlain, a power of dispensing therewith, in certain cases, whenever he should find it pro∣per; and while the high office is honoured by your Lordship's exercise of its privileges, there can be no reason to apprehend an abuse of its constitution. The licentiousness with which direct personal allusions, literal ex∣tracts from letters respecting a dispute they were themselves concerned in, and the many purposes of malicious, slanderous, and insolent insinuation, which have already been brought forward upon the Boards of the Royalty Theatre, sufficiently prove how little it is an
<PB N="7" REF="4"/>
object with the Authors and Managers of that undertaking to adhere to, or pay the least respect to the great purposes of the Drama, and to what vile uses a Theatre is likely to be applied which is not regulated by the Laws enacted for its support and welfare.</P>

<HEAD>A VERY PLAIN STATE of the CASE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE persons interested in the support and success of the Royalty Theatre, have with infinite address endeavoured to turn aside the attention of the public from the original merits of the undertaking; and well knowing that ground was not very tenable, like able advocates in a cause where facts bear down the best evidence they can bring forward, a warm, animated and pathetic appeal, however ill founded, is made to the passions of the Jury, with a view to gain that success on the ground of humanity and charity, which a dependence upon the justice of their cause could never obtain them.—<Q>Hence “Mr. Palmer struggles, as a tender
<PB N="2" REF="6"/>
husband and an affectionate parent, to pro∣vide for a numerous family, whose entire dependence is upon his honest exerti∣ons;”</Q> hence <Q>“the unparalleled cruel∣ty with which he has been singled out the object of legal oppression;”</Q> and hence the public, who are ever forward to relieve domestic woe, and to become the patrons of injured merit, were expected to have been caught by the device, and to have turned out the decided supporters of the laudable undertaking: but the public, who are some∣times very easily to be taken in, saw too plainly the stalking horse they were, in this instance, designed to be made of, and therefore, very ungratefully to be sure, disallowed the claim which disappointed folly had thought proper to make upon them.</P>
<P>The project having completely failed, there would be a degree of illiberality in follow∣ing the unfortunate, if the general conduct of the business had not been prosecuted with a spirit of little low trick and cunning, of insolence, of unprovoked malice, and of direct personal slander, which calls for expo∣sure, and ought not, in justice to the greatly injured, to be concealed.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="7"/>
To investigate the affair thoroughly, it may not be amiss to leave the Managers of the Patent Theatres out of the question a little, while the original undertaking is made the subject of enquiry; and I will venture to pronounce, that either the scheme was the most extravagantly absurd, preposterous, ridiculous speculation that ever was sub∣scribed to, or the schemers mere impostors, in whom the truth is not. If facts do not confirm this, it will go for nothing.</P>
<P>The authors of the scheme, which was declared to have been from the first to per∣form plays and farces, either did imagine they were legally authorised to carry it into execution, or they knew they were not.</P>
<P>To fet out with as much good manners as it is possible to attempt in such company, I will give (for argument's sake) credit to their own assertions, and for a moment ad∣mit to be true what Mr. Palmer advances in his address.</P>
<P><Q>“This Theatre was built under a letter of approbation from the Lord Lieute∣nant Governor of the Tower; and being situated in a Palace and Fortress, in a
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
district immediately within his jurisdic∣tion, his consent, added to a licence ob∣tained from the magistrates, authorising a place of public entertainment, were deemed legal authority.”</Q></P>
<P>It is needless, in this place, to quote the Acts, they have been too recently be∣fore the Public to make it necessary; equally so is it to say any thing about the probability or the improbability of Mr. Palmer and his friends in the concern, being very well ac∣quainted with them. A shorter way pre∣sents itself, in the words of their own ad∣vocate, who says—<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> a Review of the present Contest, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> <Q>“He had obtained the consent of the Magistrates of that district, therefore nothing from that quarter was to be expected; and <HI>though he evidently had an Act of Parliament directly in his teeth,</HI> &amp;c.”</Q></P>
<P>His having secured the consent of the Magistrates, (who by the bye are the very people whose subscriptions built the house) is a most unquestionable proof that he knew the <HI>letter of approbation from the Lord Lieu∣tenant of the Tower</HI> would not, nor coul<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
not legally authorise such a place of public entertainment as they had planned; equally notorious is it, that they could not be ig∣norant of the insufficiency of the Magistrates licence for the protection and support of the scheme; and the common sense which told them both were inadequate, told them like∣wise the one could de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive no strength what∣ever from the other.</P>
<P>A report however has obtained, which is very generally credited, and has not been contradicted, that Lord Cornwallis by no means approved of the undertaking, and linding by the petitions the neighbour∣ing parishes presented, praying the scheme might not be suffered to go on, that it was objected to even by those whose convenience was the pretence for the undertaking, he absolutely declared his resolution to oppose it. This intention of his Lordship could apply only to the establishing a Theatre, without any consideration of the particular entertainments meant to be exhibited; for his Lordship could not be so extremely un∣informed as not to know that his official power was inadequate to the authorising per∣formance
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
of Plays and Farces. The depar∣ture of Lord Cornwallis to his Oriental go∣vernment, was highly favourable to the scheme; it opened a fine field for deception and imposition, and the use which has been made of his Lordship's name in the business, shews the parties were very well disposed to turn it to account. But whether this be so or not, admit or reject this circumstance re∣lative to Lord Cornwallis's sentiments and intentions, take it in the most favourable point of view for the projectors, and it can∣not but appear to have been the most extra∣vagantly absurd, the most preposterous, and the most ridiculous speculation that ever was subscribed to. This is under the idea of their imagining that they had authority for what they were about.</P>
<P>But now, to take it the other way, which I believe will, by most people of discern∣ment, be thought the right way of judging it, what are we to say of a set of Justices, with an Editor of a news-paper, and an eminent Actor, who in order to give a little colour to a business that would not very well bear the light, affect to believe what they
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
knew to be false, in order to establish a claim to the pity of the public, and to induce them to feel, that <HI>though the poor proprietors have been mistaken as to the legality of their plan, it would be devilish hard for them not to be supported, after expending their</HI> ALL <HI>for our amusement, and therefore we must stick by them at all events?</HI> I ask again, whether such is or is not the conduct of Impostors? And to shew why I believe that most people of discernment will think this the right light to view it in, I beg to offer a few observations.</P>
<P>From the parade of laying the first stone, the greatest mystery was maintained as to the nature of the authority that was to warrant the undertaking. To his brother perform∣ers, and his most intimate friends, Mr. Pal∣mer always declined the question, by a most significant hint, that <HI>there were reasons,</HI> and <HI>you must excuse me,</HI> &amp;c. What can speak plainer than this, that they knew they had no authority whatever to justify their pro∣ceeding? Nay, this same farcical mystery was kept up till a day or two before the Theatre opened, and Mr. QUICK was given
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
to understand, that their authority was most unquestionable, that when it was produced it would utterly defeat the hopes of their opponents, but that <HI>there were reasons of the greatest magnitude why it could not, must not be explained, no not even to him!</HI> De∣pending upon this assertion, QUICK was firm to his engagement with them, nor did he relinquish it, till he found he had been tricked, duped and imposed upon from the beginning, and that the boasted legal autho∣rity, like the th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>usand pounds indemnifica∣tion with which he was also amused, was a mere trick to deceive him, as the whol<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> scheme was to deceive the Public. Does i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> then, or does it not appear, that they knew they had no sufficient authority for what the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> were about? If it does, read the paragrap<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I have quoted from Mr. Palmer's address and tell me how is their account to be settle with that Public they have so grossly in¦sulted?</P>
<P>I now ask, can any thing be plainer tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that the scheme was to preclude enquir<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and to defy objection, by throwing a veil <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> mystery over the authority that was to su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦port
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
them, until such time as the building was finished, all the necessary expences in∣curred, and the door keepers ready to take the cash; <Q>and then, to put the best face they could upon things, to bully it out, if that was possible to be done; and if not, to raise a popular cry in their favour, by applying the most opprobrious epithets to whoever should (even in defence of their own pro∣perty) venture to discountenance the scheme, depending for very warm support upon the effect which the embarkation of their <HI>little all,</HI> and the <HI>“tender husband, the affectionate "parent, and the numerous offspring”</HI> would have upon the soft corner of John Bull's heart;</Q> but he, honest soul, having a little head as well as heart, was not to be caught in so very clumsy a trap, and so the bubble burst. This firm however of Palmer and Co. including so numerous a body of opu∣lent and <HI>trading</HI> Justices, (and if this is not making a trade of their Magisterial power, I don't know what the devil is!) was not to be broken up, even if things so far did fail; no, no. The game was at any rate a very safe one, for in case they missed of the great
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
stake for which they played, there were other chances, which made the venture de∣sirable, as even a Theatre for Burletta's, In∣terludes and Pantomimes, in a part of the town so distant from any other, and where there was so much Gallery company to be drawn in, would pay good interest for the money, and thus all would be well at the worst.</P>
<P>So much for the original scheme; and now for that part of its progress which is related to the attack upon the Managers of the established Theatres.</P>
<P>The Advertisement containing Extracts from the Acts, with Counsel's opinion there∣on, was the first open declaration of the op∣position intended to be maintained agains<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the scheme. It was unequivocal and de∣cided; it was in all respects proper accord∣ing to the object in view. Whether that ad∣vertisement was inserted by or under the di∣rection of the Magistrates or the Managers has not been explained. For the credit o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Commission, I should hope it is th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> former; if the latter, no man in his sense will argue for a moment that he would no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="11" REF="15"/>
have done the same, had he an extensive property in either of the established Theatres. That is a point not to be contended; but it seems a plurality of opinions are entertained respecting the propriety of denouncing such resolution so near the opening of the Theatre. To pursue this consideration, the argument requires that we admit the Advertisement to have come from the Managers. Much has been said about the want of liberality and fairness in not declaring their intentions be∣fore matters had gone so far; but very little indeed of that much would have been said, if those who made the observation had been acquainted with the cloud of concealment which put it out of every body's power to know, or even to guess, what Mr. Palmer's real intentions were. <Q>His most particular friends were quite in the dark about it. The common question wherever the topic was broached was, “Well, what do you think Palmer will do after all?”</Q> <Q>To which the common answer was, “That I believe nobody knows but himself!”</Q> <Q>And the as common observations were, “Why he holds out that he shall perform Plays and Farces,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
and that such and such performers are engaged for that purpose; but, that can∣not be—the violation of property in the other Theatres, and the Act of Parlia∣ment for the protection of that property▪ will render it impossible, unless he gets an Act in his favour.”</Q> <Q>Well, says one who knows him, “All I can say is, that he is very positive in his manner of speaking of it.”</Q> <Q>“But has he said what his au∣thority is to be?”</Q> <Q>“No, that he keeps to himself; and, no doubt, for some very sufficient reason.”</Q> A general laugh, or a few significant hems at the absurdity of such holdings out, generally terminated the con∣versation; and theatrical people will ten to one bear me out in asserting, that where one person had an idea of Plays being acted at the Royalty Theatre, a hundred scouted the opinion as absurd, improbable, and ridicu∣lous to the greatest degree. Under such circumstances then how could either of the three Managers attempt an interference in a business every body but the conductors of i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew nothing at all about? Even admitting that they suspected it, the mere suspicion
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
would not warrant their taking any measures. As Mr. Palmer thought proper to be so mysterious, it would have been imperti∣nence in them to have tried to extort infor∣mation; and the hardship he now complains of from their not declaring their sentiments sooner, comes with just as good a grace as the remonstrance of a Smuggler who had been suffered to build his cutter under the very Custom-house windows, without hav∣ing the least notice given him of the officers intention to seize his property till the boat was finished, the cargo on board, and his little all, with the means for supporting his wife and rising progeny stowed in her hold. The laws against smuggling, and the laws for protecting Theatrical property, are so thoroughly well known and understood, as to leave the one character as well as the other without any reasonable plea of hard usage on that ground. The cases however differ in some respects, for it seldom happens I be∣lieve, that the officers of the Customs go snacks with the smugglers in face of open day, whereas the Justices <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The majority of the Justices belonging to that division.</NOTE> who rank on the one side as the Custom-house officers do on
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
the other, are the avowed aiders and abettors of the business from first to last.</P>
<P>An explanation of the finesse with which the managers were severally tricked into a tacit indifference as to what was going on in the East, will easily account for Mr. Col∣man's writing the lines so much dwelt upon in Mr. Palmer's benefit prologue, and for the non-interference of the winter managers, though here I should speak only of those be∣longing to Drury Lane, Mr. Harris I be∣lieve not having opportunities of conversing with him at all. To Mr. Colman it was seriously held out that the plan was to open only in the winter; to the others it was to be a summer scheme, and so the ball of de∣ception was bandied about. The first sus∣picion Mr. Colman had of its being a sum∣mer scheme, arose from Mr. Palmer's dis∣inclination to sign articles for the present season; but as things were not ripe enough to justify his throwing off the mask entirely, he covered that with a very good grace by actually executing the agreement, trusting no doubt, to the penalty's never being en∣forced, on account of the illiberality of such
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
a step on Mr. Colman's part in the eye of the world; besides, if he did pursue it to trial, the tale of domestic woe, and the loss of the <HI>little all,</HI> would, upon the suscepti∣ble hearts of an English jury, operate so as to bring down the damages to a very mode∣rate amount. All this is in strict conformity with the original plan.</P>
<P>There is one circumstance in the carrying on of this contest which must not be over∣looked, and that is the marked inveteracy with which Mr. Harris is singled out from the other two managers. The reason is ob∣vious. The engagement at Drury Lane must not be given up, a little tenderness is there∣fore not altogether unnecessary there; and as the cards have gone, it will never do to pre∣vent the possibility of a future summer's re∣treat behind the scenes of the Haymarket Theatre, too much violence must on the like account be avoided here too; but with the Covent Garden manager there are nei∣ther hopes nor fears to be entertained. At him without mercy! make him pay for all! charge, prime, present, fire, and away fly at his head all the little dirty malice, odious
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
epithets, unworthy insinuations, false sug∣gestions, and downright personal insults that words can be made to convey.</P>
<P>There are few situations in life which does not expose a man to the making some enemies, be his general conduct ever so com∣mendable; but a prime minister is not liable to make more enemies than the manager of a Theatre, and when once he can be brought out and set up as the mark to be peppered away at, egad they all let fly; envious and disappointed authors, ignorant and discarded actors; not a painter that can hold a brush, or a carpenter that can pull a rope in a pan∣tomime, and has been refused such a situa∣tion as he conceits himself qualified for, but what at a moment like this will have his fling at the manager. Fortified with the best possible defence, the consciousness of having done and deserved well by the pub∣lic, and proudly upheld by their unequivo∣cal confirmation of his being entitled to that character; to such a man as Mr. Harris, these rifle shots are no more than pellets ou<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of a pop-gun, deadened by the invulnerabl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> resistance of a good name, and a standing
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
with the public not easily shaken; the shafts of petty malice are incapable of wounding, and disgrace only the archer that can basely seek gratification in selecting such a victim for his vengeance.</P>
<P>To stand forth the advocate of insulted character is a duty all good citizens owe to one another; and surely there never was an instance of such unprovoked, such malevo∣lent, and such persecuting treatment, as in conformity with the abominable plan I have described, has been heaped upon this gen∣tleman's shoulders. But he is in the hands of the public, a public that knows, that ac∣knowledges his claim to their approbation, and are ready to testify their sense of his in∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ries. Specious and plausible was the trick <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o point him out as the oppressor, and Mr. Palmer as the oppressed; but the unqualified violence of the attack soon shewed who was <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he persecutor and who the persecuted, and the resentment it excited burns strongly in the breasts of the liberal-minded part of the public, who are not capriciously to be sway∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d from their experience, or so very easily to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made the tools of an artful and designing
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
party. I advance nothing more than those who know him best will proclaim him to be well deserving of; and I am induced to deal forth so much in his commenda∣tion, because he, for no reason whateve<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but that of aiming to protect his own pro¦perty in a lawful way, has been treated wit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> insults that could be merited only by th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> common plunderer of another's property an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the infamous assassin of another's characte<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Were Mr. Palmer a proprietor of either <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the winter Theatres, would he tamely <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> still and suffer so bold an attempt to be pra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦tised to his prejudice, without at least stri<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ing to oppose it? Were he to answer n<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> question in the negative, would any one b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lieve him?</P>
<P>But the fact respecting the opposition I find extremely different from what has be<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> understood. It is not the Managers of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Theatres, but the Magistracy in the ex<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦cise of their proper duty, and influenced the interposition of the highest authority the government. Never was authority <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦erted with greater propriety; never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
the Public more sensible of it. Had the then Secretary of State pushed on the County Justices, and those of Westminster, at the commencement of Lord George Gordon's affair, as Lord Sydney has done in a very timely, and a very proper way in this, the laws of the country had not been trod under foot, nor the dreadful consequences have followed which the supineness of the civil power gave way to at that unhappy period. It is only by an early interference in support of violated laws that effect can be given to the object in view. Had the Wellclose-Square scheme been suffered to rear its head, we should, by degrees, have had similar ex∣cressences disgracing the Drama in every part of the town; their numbers would have pre∣vented their success, and the ruin of all would have been the consequence. That two Theatres in winter, and one in the sum∣mer, are as many as the town with all the influx of strangers can support, is verified in Mr. Harris's not even making use of the dormant Patent he is possessed of. The Public know this, and naturally ask, Why then should an ill-judged scheme be coun∣tenanced
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
for the ideal benefit of one, when the probability is, that it would bring about the ruin of all?</P>
<P>The indeceny, the inconsistency, and the extreme cruelty of dragging forth Mr. Har∣ris before the Public, not merely as the only opposer of Mr. Palmer's views, but as a premeditated enemy to his success in life, and an active foe to the prosperity of his family, has not only been universally repro∣bated, but with the general execration such infamous arts deserve, it has been very suf∣ficiently branded by most of the writers in the public papers, both favourers and op∣posers of the Royalty Theatre scheme.</P>
<P>Men capable of such illiberal conduct, and who can be so regardless of the consequences that seldom fail to follow, are of too des∣perate a description to hesitate about any fur∣ther measures, however violent or however dangerous, that may afford them the most distant gleam of hope, either to carry their own point, or to oppress, injure, and distress the marked objects of their malice. Much therefore is yet to be expected from them
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
Petitions to Parliament, praying for autho∣rity to carry their plan into execution will, no doubt, be hawked about for signature, and presented with as many names as the Eastern part of the town can be supposed to lodge. The idea of acquiring popularity themselves, by depriving the other managers of it, will unquestionably be followed up by every art that can be devised. Much has already been done, though happily without effect, to stir up in the public a disposition to mark an attachment to the new theatre by testimonies of their resentment to the ma∣nagers of the old; and as the game has been played so as to make all the acrimony that can be excited, centre in its application to Mr. Harris only, (and that for the reasons I have before described) the evident object is to excite a disturbance at the opening of his theatre, and to work about an injury to his property by the consequence of a riot. With the public on his side, however, Mr. Harris has nothing of that kind to dread: serious indeed would be the consequences to Mr. Palmer, and to those who depend upon him for subsistence, if such an attempt was
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
to be carried into execution; for the bold and unqualified steps he has taken in the face of open day, to bring about such an event, by various other means as well as by the strong points to that end in his public ad∣dress, would place him in a situation to ex∣perience, in a severer degree than perhaps has ever yet been felt, the force of that jus∣tice which an appeal, from an individual so grossly injured, to the decision of an Eng∣lish jury, could not fail to draw down upon him.</P>
<P>Such are the circumstances of the extra∣ordinary case I have undertaken to state, and agreeable to my undertaking I have stated them plainly. It was high time the veil should be removed, and the generous pub∣lic, who had discernment enough to preserve them from being dupes to the scheme, fully informed of its extent. They will decide for themselves; and it is upon the general rectitude and the justice of their decision, that Mr. Harris is to look up for protection against the most impudent and the most un∣provoked attack upon character that ever was attempted.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="27"/>
Standing forward the ostensible chief in the conduct of this business, Mr. Palmer must of course receive and suffer the greatest part of the odium which accompanies it; but those who know him, know that had his been the conduct and the rule, such il∣liberality would never have marked the pro∣gress of the scheme; and here the line must be drawn. In the folly of the undertaking, he no doubt had his share, but he surren∣dered the management of it to one who is confessedly better informed, and more equal to the task, had he kept within the proper line; thereby he has suffered himself to be∣come the dupe of a Viper, whose venomous sting has darted its poison with too much effect on former occasions, which the Public are very well acquainted with, and who in this instance, by acting under cover of ano∣ther person's name, has given him heavy cause to repent the dependence that has been placed upon him. The man however who adopts an error, makes it his own; and it remains for Mr. Palmer to stem the torrent of reprehension he has brought upon him∣self, as well as he can, having at least the
<PB N="24" REF="28"/>
<HI>pity</HI> of the Public for the consequences of his inconsiderate conduct.</P>
<P><Q>What further remains to be said on the subject, may be more satisfactorily offered by way of reply to, or remark upon, certain passages in the Pamphlet published in favour of the Royalty Theatre and its conductors, under the title of “A Review of the pre∣sent” Contest between the Managers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>

<P>What pretence then has he for proceeding as he has done, in utter contempt of those acts?</P>
<Q><P><Q>“Mr. Quick complains of Mr. Palmer having thrown out false colours to the performers who engaged under his ban∣ners, by asserting that he had a legal sanction for the establishment of his thea∣tre, when he had no such sanction; cer∣tainly Mr. Palmer is culpable for keeping the performers in the dark respecting their situation, for by that means they were about to perform under the idea of a legal sanction, when they were subject to the act for the punishment of vagrants; but
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
nevertheless, it must be acknowledged, though not strictly justifiable in Mr. Pal∣mer, with respect to the performers, that it was <HI>sound policy</HI> as a General, to keep the enemy in the dark, with respect to the weakness of his ammunition.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>"Sound policy?" rank deceit, treachery and imposition! but such being the foun∣dation of the scheme, 'tis no wonder a simi∣lar conduct was deemed necessary to the carrying it on.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“Mr. Palmer has done what will ever raise him in the opinion of the Pub∣lic; having not only contributed the pro∣fits of the first night of his performance to the London Hospital, but has gener∣ously offered one night for their benefit every successive season of his representa∣tion.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P><Q>And so in giving away what he could not keep without a certainty of being sent to Bridewell, or paying penalties greatly be∣yond

it, “he has done what will ever raise him in the opinion of the Public!”</Q>—Well said Mountebank! Andrew, where are you now?!!!</P>

<P><HI>Or a Palmer,</HI> the Gentleman may now add, as the performances of the Royalty Theatre are exactly upon the same plan.</P>
<Q><P>—<Q>“Or any other of those promoters of not only ribaldry and nonsense, but im∣morality: these exhibitions, I will ven∣ture to affirm, are a disgrace to the Ma∣gistrates who suffer them; they have no one object in view, which can be com∣mended, or even passed over with silence; they are relaxations from business without any attention to rationality; but they ra∣ther disorder the minds of the lower class of people, encourage that weakness which
<PB N="31" REF="35"/>
they already too much possess, and induce them to follow the footsteps of idleness with unwearied industry (by the Critic's leave, no paradox), rather than those of industry herself.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P><Q>Perfectly right! perfectly right throughout the whole of this paragraph. How then shall the Magistrates justify the establishing such a nursery for “ribaldry, nonsense, idle∣ness, and immorality?”</Q></P>
<Q><P><Q>“In how different a light must the con∣duct of Mr. Palmer be viewed, who no∣bly, as he really could have no interested views at heart, promised to allow each of the performers, who enlisted under his banners, that they might not be left de∣stitute, one half of the salaries for which they contracted.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Mountebank again! He knew the odds against his being suffered to perform plays and farces, were, in young Philpot's words, "all Lombard Street to an egg-shell," and
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
therefore he engaged just such a company as would suit the business he expected to have for them. This being the case, his allow∣ing them but half salary during the time he kept his doors shut, was a conduct that, after what the poor people had suffered, ra∣ther smack'd of a mean, pitiful, unfeeling narrowness, than of the liberality for which he has puffed himself off in such high sound∣ing terms.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“And if the Theatre should be hereafter opened, should they in consequence of this dispute, or from any unforeseen accident that might happen, be of no service to him in their capacity, they should each of them receive the full salary for which they originally agreed, during the re∣mainder of the season?”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Wonderful benevolence! knowing at the same time, that in a few days he should have to push them forward in his interludes, bur∣lettas, and pantomimes. Or supposing that to be doubtful, how does so liberal an offer, which went to the maintenance and support
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
of a score or two of people, correspond with the exhausted finances of a man who had ad∣vanced his <HI>little all</HI> before, in order to get the house ready, or with the provident du∣ties of an affectionate father to the numer∣ous offspring, whose sole dependence was upon him for the bread they eat? But this is true mountebank again.</P>

<HEAD>As the Author of the REVIEW has thought proper to make Mr. Palmer's address, and other literary productions on the subject, a part of his book, I hope I am not taking an improper liberty, seeing those articles thus before me, if I ven∣ture to animadvert a little upon them.</HEAD>
<Q><P><Q>“This Theatre was built under a Letter of approbation from the Lord-Lieutenant Governor of the Tower; and, being situ∣ated in a Palace and Fortress, in a district
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
immediately within his jurisdiction, his consent, added to a licence obtained from the magistrates, authorising a place of public entertainment, were deemed legal authority.”</Q></P>
<P><HI>Vide</HI> Mr. Palmer's Address.</P></Q>
<P>Read page 5 of this work.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“As Mr. Colman knew the plan I had then in view, it was fair to conclude that he did not meditate an opposition.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Mr. Colman did <HI>not</HI> know the plan Mr. Palmer had in view, he was tricked into a belief that the plan was widely different. Read page 14 of this work.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“Mr. Harris, the manager of Covent Garden Theatre, gave his consent in wri∣ting, that Mr. Quick should be engaged here.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>What a fuss has been made about Mr. Harris's consent to Mr. Quick's engaging, when we all know that his consent, or his
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
objecting, could not influence Mr. Quick, or any other performer belonging to his Theatre, if not so disposed of their own ac∣cord. They have no occasion to consult Mr. Harris about any thing of the kind, from the closing of his Theatre one season, to the opening it another. If they do it at all, it must be a matter of courtesy; and it is as plain as the sun at noon day, that Mr. Harris, without adopting a language he had no right to use, and telling them they should not, did, from first to last, dissuade those who consulted him, from having any thing to do with so absurd an undertaking, telling them at the same time, that they were to do as they pleased, for he had no right to controul them one way or other. How then can this be construed into a consent?</P>
<Q><P>"I have the satisfaction to find, that those three gentlemen are the only enemies to this undertaking."</P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Never more mistaken in your life, Mr. Palmer. The undertaking, almost as much
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
as the mode of carrying it on, is scouted in nine companies out of ten all the town over.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“For myself, I have embarked my all in this Theatre; persuaded, that under the sanction I obtained, it was perfectly legal.”</Q></P>

<Q>“And we hope that the Three Managers, with the magistrate in their interest”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>That magistrate had the unanimous thanks of all the Justices at the county meeting, for his proper conduct throughout the business, and for the praise-worthy zeal he had shewn to do his duty; while the same respectable meeting, and to their honour be it spoken, reprobated the conduct of the Justice who particularly countenanced the lawless scheme, and who in consequence of the galling lesson they gave him, absolutely committed all the performers (with whom he till then had gone on as a partner in the common cause) for three hours to the green-room. While such men are admitted to act in the com∣mission of the peace it is no wonder men of character are so shy of the appointment. And let me here ask, under what pretence it is represented that the managers were the suppressors of the scheme? Who will now say that it was done by any other than the magistracy at large, not a busy individual, but the body of Justices of the Peace, who
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
at a county meeting were roused to a sense of their duty in defence of the laws, which were scarce ever before so flagrantly insulted?</P>
<Q><P><Q>“A combination being formed to oppress and ruin me.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Though Mr. Palmer here means insi∣diously to allude to the managers, the asser∣tion can apply only to the justices, assembled at the county meeting. A poor wretch who for violating the laws of his country is placed at the bar of the Old Bailey, might say the very same of the Jury appointed to try him, and with just as much reason.</P>

<HEAD>Mr. Harris's letter to Mr. Quick, is so much to the purpose, and it marks so sincere a regard for the stage in his argu∣ments for preserving the respectability of the professors, that I should but ill shew my earnestness for the cause I have un∣dertaken, if I were to pass it over with∣out notice.</HEAD>
<Q><P><Q>“By this time, I suppose you all confess, (for it must always have been known) that nothing but an Act of Parliament can legalize its opening. Will you, one of the heads of a profession in itself as li∣beral as that of law, physic, or any other, degrade, vagabondize, and, as far as you are able, ruin all Theatrical Property, and in most certain consequence, all its de∣pendants? Such must be our inevitable fate, when unprotected by legal mono∣poly,” and Royal Parliamentary sanction.</Q></P>
<P>Vide Mr. Harris's Letter.</P></Q>
<P>It ever has been such when unprotected by legal monopoly, and will be again, should the time ever arrive when that monopoly is
<PB N="40" REF="44"/>
done away. Are those <HI>friends</HI> to the stage then who cry out against the legal mono∣poly? No. Traitors to the constitution of the drama, and underminers of the very foundation upon which its success is so proudly erected.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“If Mr. Palmer can perform plays, &amp;c. &amp;c. why not Mr. Hughes, Mr. Jones, Mr. Astley, and Sadler's Wells, and Free∣mason's Hall, <HI>&amp;c.”</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Why not indeed?</P>
<Q><P><Q>“Depend on it, your plan leads to the making an Actor and a Manager two of the most despicable characters in society:—A Physician is a most honourable em∣ploy, but who more infamous than a Mountebank?”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Incontrovertibly so.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“Your caution to me, about being the single ostensible opposer of your scheme,
<PB N="41" REF="45"/>
I take exceedingly kind; but you your∣self are an instance, that I have hitherto not so acted.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>The only ostensible and the effectual op∣posers of the scheme were the Magistrates, and well is it for the reputation of the Stage, that they have so acted.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“You know I have not <HI>actively</HI> opposed you, nor any one of your Company, from agreeing with the Proprietors of that place.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Why no, it would have been exercising a controul which while Covent Garden Theatre was shut up, he could not reconcile to the liberal principles which with the public has ever formed a leading feature of his cha∣racter.</P>
<Q><P><Q>“At the same time, I feel it would be disingenuous not to confess to you, that my absolute inactivity arises from con∣viction,
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
that an attempt so palpably in the face of all legal authority cannot succeed.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P></Q>
<P>Who, but the silly schemers of this ridi∣culous business, could even for a single mo∣ment imagine it would?</P>
<P>The grossness and impudence with which detached sentences of this letter were brought forward upon the public Stage, could be equalled only by the sufferance of the au∣dience which permitted it to be done with impunity. But they knew where they were, and that accounts for it.</P>
<P>The unanswerable matter contained in the following appeal, as it goes so much stronger than any thing I can advance to the points it alludes to, must not be omitted.</P>
<P><Q>“Mr. Harris thinks it would be an af∣front to the often experienced candour of the Public, to offer any thing more in proof, that the insinuation of duplicity on the part of Mr. Harris has no foundation
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
whatever, as to the complaint, that no notice was given during the building of the Theatre. It may be asked, could it be considered as incumbent on the Paten∣tees to lay down the law for Mr. Palmer? In fact, the Acts of Parliament restraining the performances of Plays, Interludes, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> were notorious to Mr. Palmer, and all concerned in theatrical representa∣tions. But Mr. Palmer uniformly, and with the most solemn asseverations in∣sisted, he possessed a complete, though concealed, legal right for theatrical per∣formances. Indeed, Mr. Palmer himself acted inconsistently with his avowal, by actually engaging himself in the begin∣ning of February to Mr. Colman, for his regular performances during the whole of the Season at the Haymarket Theatre, though at the same time, he was by every means engaging others to perform for him in Wellclose-square. Still, however, this firm language (of having legal authority) he invariably held until Monday last, when it appeared to Mr. Quick and others, that he had none. To such hidden pre∣tended
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
authority, Mr. Harris could only oppose his disbelief of the fact, and any notice of such, his opinion, given for∣merly in writing to Mr. Palmer, must have been ridiculous in the extreme. Mr. Harris is much concerned, to be <HI>compelled</HI> thus to obtrude himself on the public no∣tice, being conscious that the attacks of falsehood and disappointed malevolence are the most completely repelled by per∣fect silence and contempt; and this me∣thod, which he conceives to be most consistent with the high respect and duty he owes the <HI>public,</HI> he will most determi∣nately oppose to the calumny which he” must expect to incur upon this occasion.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“Mr. Harris has too much regard for the profession by which he lives, not to feel with much concern the distresses that must be endured by numbers of the drama's dependants, who have relied on Mr. Pal∣mer's assurances for a subsistence for the ensuing summer; he therefore gives this public notice, that if those under the above description can form such a company as may be able to give any theatrical per∣formance
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
that may probably attract the notice of the Public, sufficient to afford them any relief in their present situation, they are welcome to the free use of Co∣vent Garden, wardrobe, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> for three nights, at any time that may be most convenient to them, between the present and the first of August next.”</Q></P>
<P>Ibid.</P>
<P>In preserving the silence and contempt he promised, he has acted with the greatest pro∣priety. His offer in behalf of the per∣formers Mr. Palmer had engaged could ori∣ginate only in a benevolent and good mind; his guarding that offer by saying, that if they could form such a company as might be able to give a performance likely to attract the notice of the public, &amp;c. was perfectly con∣sistent with the respect he professes to have for the public, as they could not be invited to an exhibition of mummery, at Covent Gar∣den Theatre, without feeling that resent∣ment toward the responsible conductor of the entertainments there, which in such a case they would most certainly exercise.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="50"/>
The insolent air of the performers' ad∣vertisement in reply, was the very essence of ignorance, impudence, and ingratitude, and did Mr. Palmer (for suffering so barn-like a composition to appear) more injury with the public than he can possibly conceive. <Q>Some∣what of the same temper and stile is the composition signed "JOHN PALMER," and dated “Royalty Theatre, June 22, 1787.”</Q> It however produced one good consequence, and that was the letter which three days after appeared in the Morning Chronicle, under the signature of WHIT∣TINGTON, and which, to shew that I am not above following the example even of my adversary, where I think he is right, I will, like him, take the liberty of copying.</P>

<P><Q>“YOUR claim to the sympathy of the Public, is somewhat like that of an Houn∣flow collector; he, like you, only vio∣lates

the laws of his country, and then, in mitigation of his fault, he pleads the wants of a numerous progeny. You, however, are the greater aggressor. The poor, misled and vitiated marauder has, perhaps, real poverty to encounter in ex∣tenuation of his error; but you, Sir, on the contrary, with an income of upwards of a thousand a-year, to fly in the face of the laws of your country, and then to affect ignorance, is not only the grossest insult on the Public, but upon its legal repre∣sentatives,” the British legislature.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“The property of the three English thea∣tres in this metropolis, is deemed to be as well secured by an express statute, as any chartered right in the kingdom. It is transferable, as all other landed secu∣rities, upon the good faith of the English constitution. Those who choose either to embark their all, or a small por∣tion of their fortunes, in these three le∣galized theatres, do it like stock-holders, or land-holders, from a conscious opi∣nion of their stability; and this opinion too is congenial to that true spirit of le∣gislation,
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
which is always very wary how it infringes upon private property when it” is fairly purchased.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“With equal justice, Sir, might you build upon another man's ground, and then insist, from your ignorance, or your large family, that you ought to be sup∣ported by public sympathy in your illegal encroachment. Are you in want? Set forth a subscription, in addition to your large salary and your two yearly benefits. Your merit, like your family, is no doubt considerable: the town will feel for your embarrassments, and most likely subscribe towards your relief with their accustomed generosity. This will be acting like an” honest though embarrassed citizen.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“But your present conduct is somewhat worse. By attempting to infringe upon the rights of others, you very much di∣minish your own claims upon the purse of the public. To real distress it is ever open:—even with fictitious distress it is seldom shut. But to the sturdy suppli∣cant, who is fool-hardy enough to make an arrogant inroad on the laws of his

country, and afterwards sue for its mercy, if the public purse be then opened, it must proceed from that sort of pity that is ex∣cited” by the infant settlers of South Wales.</Q></P>
<P><Q>“However, Sir, I really feel for your de∣lusion, as it must, no doubt, involve you in some difficulties. But, for these you stand indebted only to your own injudi∣cious friends, and your heated imagina∣tion: you are neither injured by the pro∣prietors of the theatres, nor by the pub∣lic that fill them. An over-laudable and left handed zeal for your own interest, at the expence of others, has hurried you into your present situation.

<HEAD>"CASE and OPINION.</HEAD>
<P><Q>“BY the 10th of George, it is enacted, that no person shall, for hire, gain, or reward, act, represent, or perform, or cause to be acted, &amp;c. &amp;c. any interlude, tragedy, comedy, play, farce, or other entertainment of the stage, except under a Patent from the Crown, or a Licence from the Lord Chamberlain, as by said” act is provided.</Q></P>

<P><Q>“Are you of opinion, that by a licence under the 26th Geo.

<P><Q>“I am of opinion that no licence, under the 26th Geo.

<P>"EDWARD BEARCROFT.</P>

<P><PB N="52" REF="56"/>
For every performance they are all liable, from the Manager and <HI>honest</HI> Charles Ban∣nister down to Leoni's little Pupil, to a se∣parate information, which will oblige them each to pay a penalty of 50l. for every offence, or to be imprisoned in Bridewell, for each offence, three months; and these informations may be lodged any time within six months from the day on which each of∣fence was committed. The very little le∣nity to which Mr. Palmer is entitled by such a conduct as is explained in the foregoing sheets, or the performers by the impudent and ungrateful return they made to Mr. Harris's benevolent offer, need not be dwelt upon, it is sufficient for me to shew how much the managers have it in their power to resent the insults that have been heaped upon them, if such objects could for a moment be thought worth their resentment or further notice. But let the future conduct of the managers, respecting these performers and their chief be what it may, it is next to an impossibility for them to escape the punish∣ment which the laws pronounce, for, with∣out looking to the many Justices' runners,
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
whose daily bread is purchased by their share of penalty incurred by the unfortunate, whom they inform against, it is not to be imagined that the numberless needy wretches about the metropolis, to whom a few pounds is so much an object, will suffer so inviting an opportunity of acquiring them to pass un∣embraced. The justices are obliged to take the informations from whoever shall come forward, and to levy the penalties. What then will be the probable situation of these poor people whenever the Theatre closes? What their continual and hourly apprehen∣sions while it is open, and while every day augments the load of guilt which is to be expiated only at so severe a rate? Indeed, after the justices have been made so much a party in the affair, their characters are at stake, nor dare they suffer the law to sleep, and therefore, as is said to a criminal placed for trial at the Bar of the Old Bailey, I con∣clude with saying to the unhappy people be∣longing to the Royalty Theatre, GOD SEND YOU A GOOD DELIVERANCE! Manager, Actors, Actresses and all.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="58"/>
Here I close my very plain state of the case. The public are to determine upon the merits of the cause. If I have departed from the truth, in any instance, I shall be contradicted; but so far as I have had to do with facts, there is little fear of that. The hurry in which I have been obliged to state the case, must be my apology for want of method, and correctness. Seeking neither same or profit, as the writer, my sole ob∣ject is to possess the Public of all the circumstances relating to this extraordi∣nary business. I do it, not to promote the views, or to support the cause of any indi∣vidual, or any set of men. I can receive no thanks from those I may be supposed to serve, because I will, if possible, remain unknown.</P>
