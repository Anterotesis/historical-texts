<HEAD>EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Courteous and Civil Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT is the Custom of the World to make Apologies before Books, and I comply with that Custom, not for Formality's Sake, but that it is reasona∣ble and just, and Self-defensive.</P>
<P>I know there will be many Objections against this Sermon, the which it is convenient to obviate. Some will say, What have the <HI>Quakers</HI> to do with the <HI>Union?</HI> I say, We have to do with the <HI>Union;</HI> for <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Union</HI> are our avow'd Principles, and ever were: And we pay as much Respect to the <HI>QUEEN</HI> of the <HI>UNION,</HI> as any loyal People ought to do.</P>
<P>Another Objection will be, Why was it not publish'd sooner? (Thus a Man's Modesty becomes his Crime!) Thou know'st, Reader, that at that Time Abundance of Sermons were printed, which had been held forth in the Pulpit by Men of Learning and Parts, adorn'd with all the Beauties of Rhetorick, and Gayety of Elo∣quence; these were universally read and admir'd. Now, for a <HI>Quaker</HI> to print his plain honest Sermon at that Time, would have been like putting a Child into the crowding Throng, to have it trampled under
<PB REF="3"/>
Foot, and smother'd in the Dust. They are the <HI>Ce∣dars,</HI> but we are the <HI>Shrubs.</HI></P>
<P>And now the great and learn'd Sermons are all read over, perhaps the Men of the World may be at Leisure to read a plain Sermon. I can tell thee, Reader, thou wilt find in it no fine Language, for it has never been in the Polisher's Hands; but 'tis as full of Truth, as an Egg is full of Meat. Thou wilt find nothing against the Government in it, but Abundunce for it, and a∣gainst its Enemies; the <HI>Tackers</HI> and <HI>High-Flyers.</HI></P>
<P>And herein, I know, I have incurr'd the Hatred and Malice of that sort of People, whose good Word is a Man's Scandal, and whose ill Word is his Honour and Glory. Nor is it any Wonder, that they abuse her Majesty's good Friends, when they are so impudent as to abuse even her Majesty her self. Ungrateful Wretches, to abuse so good a Queen! And what's the Reason of it, I pray? Only because her Majesty is for Peace and Union, and will not suffer them to destroy the harmless Flock, the Friends.</P>
<P>And I have printed this to be sold for two Pence, that it might not be burdensome and chargeable to the Friends. And I do forewarn the Reader, and every Body else, That in Case the Pirate-Printers do sur∣reptiously print this Sermon upon me, that the genuine Copy is only sold by our Friend <HI>Benjamin Bragge,</HI> and by none else.</P>
<P>And now, Reader, I bid thee farewel heartily, hoping thou wilt take in good Part, what I have held forth and publish'd for the Good, Instruction, and Edification of the Friends; I say, accept it savoura∣bly from</P>

<HEAD>THE Quakers Sermon ON THE UNION.</HEAD>
<P>MY Friends, the Men of the World, the Sons of Iniquity, and the wicked High-Church-Priests, do calumniate and abuse the Friends, the Chil∣dren of the Light, commonly known by the Name of QUAKERS, of which Number all we of the Godly here present, are.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends and Brethren, be it known unto you all and singular, unto the Women of the Light, as well as to the Men, nay, even to the friendly Babes, that I don't value what the High-Church-Priests say of us. My Friends, I no more value what they say, than I do the Barking of a pernicious Cur-Dog as I pass along the Streets, or the Saying of that High-flying Bird of Per∣dition, by the Men of the World call'd a <HI>Parrot,</HI> when he calls after me, and cries out, <HI>a Quaker, a Quaker, a Quer!</HI> No, my Friends, I don't value what these impious Ones do say of us; but the honest Men speak Evil of us, and I am afraid too justly.</P>
<P>What the Light within me has difcover'd to my out∣ward Man, I also will discover unto you, my Friends, for I am set aloft in this Place of Holding-forth, as a Beacon on the Top of a Hill, to give Light unto the Children of the Light, nay, and also to the Children of Darkness. The honest Men of the World say unto me, that we the Friends, commonly known by the Name of QUAKERS, have not Held-forth, or according to the Phrase of the World, Preach'd or Sermoniz'd on the Subject of the UNION.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="5"/>
Our good Queen ANN, with much Care and Pains, has brought this <HI>Union</HI> to pass, for the Good of every Body, Lay, even for the Good of the Friends; and, say the Men of the World, What mean the <HI>Quakers,</HI> that they take no Notice of a Thing so very considerable? I say <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nto you, my Friends and Brethren, it is a Fault, a great Fault; and therefore this Day I will strike your Ears with a Stroke on this Subject.</P>
<P>The Church-men. (I mean the honest Church-men that are on the Side of Queen ANN, not the pernicious Non∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urers) the Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erians, the Anabaprists, the Indepen∣cents, and all the Churches, except the High-flying Church of <HI>England,</HI> have preach'd on this Subject. And now, lo! I speak to that Point.</P>
<P>But, my Friends, I shall not, as the Men of the World do, take a Text, and make a long Splutter upon a few Words: I shall not, as they have done, speak of the UNION, but of its contrary and direct Opposite, DIS∣CORD.</P>
<P>Then will the Men of the World say of me, and of you, that we are cross People, that all our Religion lies in Opposition and Stubbornness; that we will not do as others <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, only because we will not. But will shew unto you and them, that to treat of DISCORD, on this Oc∣casion, is more proper, than to speak of UNION.</P>
<P>These that speak of <HI>Union,</HI> do, as the People say, put the Cart before the Horse; for <HI>Discord</HI> is before <HI>Union;</HI> and my Reason for so saying, is, because <HI>Union</HI> is after <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scord.</HI> There must be Strife, Contention, and Discord, before there can be an <HI>Union.</HI> People can't be said to be reconcil'd, that never were at Variance. And therefore, without Vanity, I say it, my speaking of <HI>Discord</HI> is far more regular, than speaking of <HI>Union,</HI> because I begin at the right End; and so, I hope, it will be said of me and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that we are more regular and orderly in our Discourses, than others our Brethren the Dissenters, nay, even than the Steeple-men themselves.</P>
<P>To speak of <HI>Union,</HI> is a lovely Subject: The Thing it self is lovely, and 'tis pleasant to speak of it, as it is to speak of a good and vertuous Wife, or a true and sincere Friend. UNION is from high Heaven and Queen ANN, but DISCORD is from the deep, low, bottomless <HI>Abyss,</HI> from <HI>dell</HI> and the <HI>High-Flyers:</HI> UNION is an <HI>Angel,</HI> but DISCORD is the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6"/>
I have read a Story, my Friends, of two Painters, that con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ded for Mastership in Art: The one drew Grapes on a Wall, so much to the Life, that the mistaken Birds came and pe k'd at 'em, as if they had been natural Fruit: The other drew on the same Wall an ill-favour'd Fellow, like a <HI>High-Flyer,</HI> that frighted away the Birds. Now, which of these was the best Artist? Certainly the latter. And so shall I be, my Friends: 'Tis less Art to paint a beauteous <HI>Angel,</HI> than an ugly <HI>Devil.</HI> If I can so paint, and hold forth in Words this monsterous <HI>Devil,</HI> DIS∣CORD, in its most ugly deform'd Shapes, I shall prove my self a better Painter, than those that have shewn UNION in all its Graces and exquisite Beauties; and to aff<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ignten Men from <HI>Discord,</HI> is sending them to <HI>Union:</HI> A good and pious Work, if artfully perform'd. As our shewing the ugly Nature of Sin, is affrightening Men to Vertue, the Terrors of <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> causes Men to take a View of GOD and <HI>Heaven;</HI> to hate the one, and be in Love with the other. When the Disguise, the Mask of Iniquity, is thrown off, then Men become in Love with the Beauties of Vertue and Godliness.</P>
<P>There is no better Way of shewing you the ugly Na∣ture of SIN, than by representing to Mankind the Mis∣chiefs it has done in this lower World. <HI>Sin</HI> is <HI>Discord:</HI> It is a Disagreement with the eternal GOD, a Rebellion against the fundamental and establish'd Laws of Heaven: It was <HI>Discord</HI> that cast our first Parents, the unhappy Originals of Mankind, out of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it was what turn'd the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> into a Wilderness, soft and de∣licate Plants into prickly Thorns, delicious Fruits into sower Grapes. From this black Fountain of <HI>Discord,</HI> has flow'd all the human Sweat, Toil, and Labour, that ever since the Fall has been intail'd on the miserable Posterity of our first Parents: Their <HI>Disunion,</HI> and <HI>Discord</HI> with GOD, brought Mankind, and even the Beasts of the Field, under hard Pressures and Bondage; and from them has the Spirit of <HI>Discord</HI> been diffus'd ever since, throughout the whole Creation.</P>
<P>We look right, when we look into the Originals and Causes of Things. By what Cause, and for what Reasons did our first Parents disagree, and fall out with their Maker? Was it not by the Temptations of a <HI>black De∣vil?</HI> And how is this fatal <HI>Discord</HI> continued, to embroil unhappy Mankind? Is it not by the Tem∣ptations
<PB N="8" REF="7"/>
and Artifices of a <HI>black High-flying</HI> Priest∣hood?</P>
<P>And what was the Occasion of the first Discord be∣twixt the Creature and the Creator? Was it not about Empire and Supremacy? The Creature would not be bound by the ecuitable Law of Heaven, but broke thro' the Boundaries set him by his Maker, the Supream Law-Giver. How did <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the Son of the Morning, and the Host of Angels, fall into utter Darkness? Was it not b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> attempting to dethrone the Almighty? Was not the Contention for Empire and Dominion, the Occasion of their Fall?</P>
<P>And is not the Spirit of <HI>Discord</HI> now reigning in the disobedient Children of High-Church, founded on the some Basis, a Struggle, and a wicked Struggle for Empire and Dominion?</P>
<P>As 'tis fabl'd of the Giants of old, how they invaded Heaven; so it is really seen how these invade the Queen's <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rer gative, and attempt a Sovereign Empire and Domi∣nion over the Consciences of their Fellow-Subjects.</P>
<P>That they invade the Queen's Prerogative, is plainly seen, in denying her a Supremacy, as Head of the Church, tho' that Dignity is essential to her high Office, as Queen of <HI>Gre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t Britain,</HI> as has been fully prov'd to them by our Friend <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Observator.</HI></P>
<P>What Instruments of <HI>Discord</HI> were these High-flying <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ack <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> at the last Election for Members of Parlia∣ment, when they went about the Country fowing the Seeds of Strife and Contention among the Queen's good Subjects, opposing the Queen's Friends, and promoting the Interest of those that were the Queen's Enemies, Lovers of <HI>Discord</HI> and Disunion? Insomuch, that had not the friendly and peaceable <HI>Quakers</HI> bestirr'd themselves, with otner the Dissenters, in Conjunction with the moderate, yet truly zealous Church-men, for the Queen's Interest, they might have accomplish'd their Design of bringing the Royal Dignity low, and the Liberty of the Subject to just nothing at all.</P>
<P>Take these High-flying Tacking Priests in their spiritual Capacity, as they term it, and they appear mutinous, re∣bellious, and harden'd in <HI>Discord:</HI> They fly in the Face or their spiritual Governours, the <HI>Bishops,</HI> who have a legal <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>isdiction over them, as the Queen has over the whole
<PB N="9" REF="8"/>
Church of <HI>England,</HI> as it is establish'd by the Laws of the Realm.</P>
<P>And this Spirit of <HI>Discord</HI> in them, is the true Spirit of the Devil; for they oppose every Thing that is good. Tho' we are of a different Perswasion from the Governours of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> yet we must acknowledge them to be the best <HI>Bishops</HI> that have been in our Days, or that we find recorded in former Ages. My Friends, we may speak feelingly and sensibly in this Point; we han't yet forgot how much we suffer'd in the black Reign of that black King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, when we were made a Prey to the Sons of Iniquity, the Informers, who plunder'd our Houses, and sold the Conveniencies of our Well-being before our Faces, taking from us the necessary Subsistance of our earthly Tabernacles. We han't forgot, that then it was esteem'd good Service for the Men cloath'd with Beasts Hides, with the carnal Weapons on their Shoulders, com∣monly known by the Name of the City Train'd-Bands, to take the Friends by the Nose, and lead them from the Pla∣ces of holding-forth, to the Goals and Dungeons, like so many Sheep to the Slaughter: I say, we can't have yet forgotten those Days of Tribulation and Bondage; and the Remembrance of those dark and cloudy Days, should serve to heighten the Thoughts of the Blessings, the Sun∣shine and Ease we now enjoy under the best of Queens, and the best of Bishops.</P>
<P>And this, my Friends, is the Occasion why the tac∣king Priests are become so much malignant; this is the Reason of their Discord, and Envy with and against the Friends, that by the gentle Reign of our good Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> their Nails are par'd so, that they cannot scratch the Dis∣senters, as they us'd to do: They are angry with their G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣vernours, the Bishops, because they are not of the same persecuting Spirit with themselves. These are the <HI>Levia∣thans</HI> of High-Church, that think they sit safe no where, but on raging Billows; they are not those Sons of <HI>Thun∣der</HI> mention'd in the Scriptares, but the Sons of <HI>Boreas,</HI> de∣lighting in Storms and Tempests; true Priests-Militants of the Church, that delight in Blood. Oh, my Soul, enter not into their Secrets! And let my righteous Spirit arise against them, whenever I make mention of their Name!</P>
<P>A spiritual Tyrant is much worse than a temporal or civil Tyrant, as much as the Soul is better than the Body. A civil Tyrant (but I think ben't very civil Folk nei∣ther)
<PB N="10" REF="9"/>
can do Mischief only to my outward Man, my E∣state and Goods, (all which are valuable in this Life) but not beyond it: But a spiritual Tyrant, such a one la s a Force upon Conscience, and makes the Ordinances of Man, Terms of Salvation; his Malice reaches beyond the Grave, even to a future State; and such is the Empire the High-Church Tacking-Priests aim at, such is their Pride, such their Malice, and their Spirit of Discord and Persecu∣tion.</P>
<P>My Friends, these Tacking-Priests, what are they? From whence came they? If they were of God, God's Work they would do. Methinks 'tis terrible to pronounce any, as coming from the Devil; but these are of their Fa∣ther the Devil, and his Works they will do.</P>
<P>And now, my Friends, han't we a fine Crew among us? Such as our Fore-fathers never knew, and such as we are asham'd of; such as have the <HI>Devil</HI> for their Father, the <HI>Pope</HI> for their Nuncle, the <HI>French</HI> King for their Ally, and would have PERKIN to be their King. These are the Tackers, whom all good Men would be glad to see, not <HI>tack'd</HI> up in their own Sense, but <HI>tuck'd</HI> up in the Sense of him, whom the Men of the World call the <HI>Fi∣nisher of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>And here, my Friends, I cannot help observing, that the High-Flyers and Tackers are the only People that fill the College o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Newgate,</HI> and create so much Trouble to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> Men at the <HI>Old Brily;</HI> ever now and then a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> puts in for a Share; but the Papists and the Tackers are Cousin-Germans, and will shake Hands even at the Gal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ows; and that dry Tree at <HI>Hyde-P rk</HI> Corner seems <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to bear no other Sort of Fruit. But when do they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any of the Friends, or other the Dissenters, making their <HI>Exit<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> at that Place?</P>
<P>And yet these Tacking-Priests would have us believe, that they are the only Priests, and that theirs is the only Church; when instead of being <HI>Pillars,</HI> they are the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the Church, and destroy every green Thing, do <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Good, but devour and ruinate.</P>
<P>They say, theirs is the only true Church. Now, what <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they mean by the Church? Why, nothing at all, but that Fabrick, call'd the <HI>Steeple-House;</HI> and because the Friends and Dissenters have not Steeples with Ding-Dongs in 'em affix'd to their Meeting-Houses, therefore t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey are not esteem'd as Churches. Poor ignorant Crea∣tures!
<PB N="11" REF="10"/>
The Church is the Assembly of the Faithful met together to worship God, according to the Scriptures, by the Direction of the Spirit within us, and the Light it has shewn us. The Church is a living, not a dead ina∣nimate Substance. It is the People, that compose the Church; 'tis not the Walls of the Steeple-House, that does it.</P>
<P>But the High-Church is the true Church, as they say: And the Tacking Non-juring Priests, are the pro∣per Priests to administer the Sacraments, as <HI>George Hickes,</HI> the Non-juring Levite, has affirm'd in a Book he has lately written against the Queen, and the Peace of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends, I do assert and affirm unto you, by the Light and the Truth which I have receiv'd, that the Sacraments are no proper Sacrifice, and that these Priests are no proper Priests to administer them.</P>
<P>I am apt to think, that these Priests are lineally de∣scended from those under the <HI>Levitical</HI> Law, who were Butchers, as well as Priests, and slew the Sacrifice with their own Hands. That Manner of Offering is now ex∣tinct by a new Dispensation; the Priests are no longer Butchers, tho' the Cruelty of the Butcher is convey'd downwards, runs in the Blood of the Tacking-<HI>Levites,</HI> is inherent in their Natures; and for this Reason, I take it, the Wisdom of the <HI>British</HI> Legislature did exclu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Priests and Surgeons from being Jurors, in Case of Life and Death, because they were Men of <HI>Blood.</HI></P>
<P>Do you think, my Brethren and Friends, that these Priests are proper Priests to administer the holy Sacra∣ments, who are Spit-Fires in the Pulpit, and out of it sow the Seed of Discord and Contention? That in wicked and scandalous Memorials abuse the Queen, her Ministry, and her good Subjects? That neglect their Preaching▪ Work, and the Souls of those committed to their Charge, and ride about the Country upon their Sorrel-Nags, to make Interest against the Queen's Friends at the Elections of Members to serve in Parliament? For Shame, ye Tac∣king-Priests, don't pretend to any Sanctity above other Peo∣ple, when your dissolute Lives encourage Atheism, and your Doctrines Slavery. You pretend to be proper Priests, when you can't properly be call'd either <HI>Britains,</HI> or Christians.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="11"/>
My Friends, it is not long ago, as I walk'd the Streets, I saw a <HI>Levite,</HI> whom the Creature had overcome, and in whom the Light was extinguish'd, wallowing in the Ken∣nel like a Swine. Now, my Friends, do any of you ima∣gine this to be a proper Priest? Or, that ever God Almighty ordain'd the holy Sacraments to be administer'd by his un∣sanctify'd Fist? Certainly no: Creatures more pure than these, are appointed to serve at the Altar.</P>
<P>Next, my Friends, how came the Sacraments to be a proper Sacrifice? Where there is Sacrifice, there is an Altar. But where is the Altar? I don't read of it in the <HI>New Testament.</HI> Every Man's own Heart may properly be call'd an Altar; but the proper Priest at this Altar, is the Man himself, who offers up to God Almighty the Sacri∣fice of a broken and contrite Spirit. The Sacraments are no proper Sacrifice; for the Priest offers up nothing for the People By Faith, Love, and new Obedience, they are made Partakers of the Benefits of the Ordinance, and this they offer up for themselves; the Priest is only a Ser∣vant at the Altar, as some of the best Church-men have acknowledg'd.</P>
<P>But to tell you the Truth, my Friends, these Tacking-Priests can be proper Priests in no Respect whatsoever. They are a Sort of Land <HI>Mer-men,</HI> half Fish and half Flesh, and yet are <HI>neither Fiso, Flesh, nor good red Herring,</HI> but black Somethings, that disturb both the Church and the State, the Queen and the People.</P>
<P>They cannot be Priests after the <HI>Levitical</HI> Order, or the <HI>Jewish</HI> Oeconomy. They may indeed perform the Eutcher's Part, in killing the Sacrifice; but 'tis to be fear'd, they would rather sacrifice the Friends, and the other Dissen∣ters, than the Blood of Bulls and of Goats. And, to be sure, we should then have no <HI>Peace-Offerings</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>em; for they are given to Strife, Envy, and Confusion.</P>
<P>And now, my Friends, I come to the Application of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat I have held forth, for the common Good of you, and every Body else; and in this I shall give you two Uses, 1st. Of Reproof, and 2dly, Of Exhortation.</P>
<P>1st. Of Reproof. You are to be reprov'd, my Friends, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea, and I must reprove you, according to the Light which <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have receiv'd. You are the Children of the Light; but you walk as if in Darkness, as if the Light shone not. But I would have you throughly illuminated in the inward <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd the outward Man; in the inward Man, that the Light
<PB N="13" REF="12"/>
within you might lead you in the safe Road to Salvation; in the outward Man, that the Eyes of your Reason might be open'd, that you might see the Wiles and Wickedness, the Craft and Cozenage, the Knavery and Villainy of the Tacking-Priests, and their Party: So that you may pass your Pilgrimage through the Wilderness of this World, without being bitten or stung by that Generation of Vipers, who are the Seed of the crooked Serpent.</P>
<P>My Friends, we are all to blame; I reprove my se'f as well as you; we have taken so much Care to look after the Light within us, that we have overlook'd those dark and black evil Spirits, that surround us without, who stand ready with their Bellows of Contention, to puff and blow out the Light. And of this we have excus'd our selves, by saying, that it was none of our Business, that belong'd to the Men of the World; our Business was to keep the Light within us in a shining Condition.</P>
<P>Now, my Friends, that this Use of Reproof may also tend to Edification and Instruction, I will fairly argue the Point with you, and lay down this Position: <HI>That the Friends, or the People commonly call'd</HI> Quakers, <HI>ought to be as much concern'd about the Civil Government of the King∣dom, as any other Sort of People that live in it.</HI></P>
<P>But here, my Friends, I must distinguish and set Things in a clear Light: I don't mean, that the Friends should concern themselves <HI>in</HI> the Government, but <HI>about</HI> the Go∣vernment; <HI>i. e.</HI> they should not attempt to get Offices and Places in the Government, but they should concern them∣selves <HI>about</HI> the Government, <HI>i. e.</HI> concerning the Support and Establishment of it. But all this while, I mean a righte∣ous Government, such as is the Government of Queen ANN.</P>
<P>We ought to live in this World, as not enjoying it; not setting our Hearts upon it, as if it were of eternal Dura∣tion; we ought not to value the good Things and Comforts of this Life, as if in them there was any real Satisfaction that an, in the least Measure, satisfy the Desires of an immortal Saul. But we ought to behave our selves as Tra∣vellers to another and better Country; and if this World bean Inn, wherein we are to lodge as but for a Night, during that Stay we ought to keep our Doors close lock'd and barr'd against Robbers, Thieves, and Cut-throats.</P>
<P>Whilst we are nere, we make a Part of the Men of the World; <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have the same Freedom by Birth-right, as any other <HI>Britains;</HI> our Property is the same as theirs;
<PB N="14" REF="13"/>
and if we will not be equally diligent and vigilaut with them in Defence of our Property, plainly, my Friends, we throw up and relinquish our Right, and do not deserve to be esitem'd as <HI>Britains,</HI> but as willing Slaves.</P>
<P>Many of you, my Friends, are Free-holders in this Kingdom, either by Patrimony of Purchase; now, your Free-hold, in its self, is not so valuable, as the Right and Property annex'd and inseparable from that Free-hold. What signifies an Estate, if it is in the Power of any one to deny me a peaceable and quiet Possession? The Free-holders in <HI>France,</HI> (one can't properly call <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em so) what do their Lands of Possession signify, when 'tis in the Power of their Tyrant to take half the Income, or more, if he pleases, to himself? Some tell me, that a Person inheriting 100 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> has seldom more than 25 <HI>l.</HI> of that 100 <HI>l.</HI> to himself, in that Country.</P>
<P>My Friends, would you be willing to live under such a Go∣vernment as this? Would you have Estates without a Ti∣tle, but such as your Tyrant pleases? I am perswaded you would not: And to this deplorable Condition you must be brought, if you don't stand up in Defence of this Govern∣ment. If you lose this good Queen, as the Tackers and <HI>Perkinites</HI> would have us do, a <HI>French</HI> Government, wooden Shoes, and arbitrary Power, must be the Consequence of it; which, I am satisfy'd, will not suit very well with any of your Stomachs: I am sure mine rises to think of it.</P>
<P>Now, the only Way for you to secure your selves in the legal Possession of your Rights, is, to stand by your Queen, who administers Justice with a steady Hand. The Rights of the People, and the Prerogatives of the Crown, are to be alike supported, and by the same Methods: The Inte∣rest of this Queen, and the Liberty of the Subject, are in∣separable; one cannot be damag'd, but the other must suffer with it.</P>
<P>It has not been so in some former Reigns: In the luxu∣rious Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> the 2d, when Vice was tri∣umphant, and all Manner of Wickedness was in Fashion; when poor Vertue was in Disgrace, and banish'd the Court; when Godliness was reputed a Crime, and was forc'd to retreat to the obscure Parts of the Land; then, I say, the Interest of the Prince and the People were not the same; for then a <HI>French</HI> Government and Popery was creeping in upon us to our Ruin, which was effected in the Reign of King <HI>Ja<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es</HI> the 2d; and we had all been ruin'd, we must
<PB N="15" REF="14"/>
have been Slaves and Papists, or murder'd or massacre'd, had we not been deliver'd by King <HI>William.</HI></P>
<P>My Friends, don't you remember how evilly intreated the Friends were, at that Time, by those that call'd them∣selves High-Church-men, who are Tackers now? How they sold our Goods for a Song, turn'd us out of House and Home, and took Possession, as if they had been licens'd Free∣booters and Robbers of the Church? Thus they did the Pope's and the Devil's Work; and had the Revolution been retarded but for a few Months longer, you would have found 'em all Popelings: The Tacking-Priests would all of 'em have been reconcil'd to the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> according to the Example of their Brother <HI>Slater,</HI> the Parish-Priest of <HI>Putnoy,</HI> and <HI>Obadiah Walker,</HI> of the famous University of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>Now, to secure the Queen's Government and our own Liberties, against the evil Devices and wicked Practices of these Men, you that have Votes at Elections of Members to serve in Parliament, be sure to vote for the Queen's Friends; her Friends are our Friends; and our Friends must be her Friends; if we are not, both she and we shall have too ma∣ny Enemies. Our Enemies, the Tackers, are united among themselves to ruin and destroy the Government; and we ought to be firmly united in the Preservation of it.</P>
<P>The Tackers can no Ways effect their Designs, but by get∣ting a Parliament of their own Kidney; and this was what they aim'd at, in their famous Bill, to prevent Occasional Conformity: For by that Bill, none of the Friends, or other Dissenters, could have a Vote at Elections, so that none but the Church-men were to chuse; and, by that Means, they thought to make themselves perpetual Dictators in the House of Commons; and what would they not have done, had not our noble Patriots, the Peers, stood up in Defence of Liberty and Property, and frustrated their wicked Designs? And then came on the Project of the TACK; the Queen must have no Money, if she wou'd not pass the Occasional Bill; she must pass all, or none. Oh! Wretches! barbarous to so good a Queen!</P>
<P>Now; my Friends, this was perfectly enslaving all the Dissenters in the Kingdom, by taking away the Privileges we are born to: My Right of Voting, is annex'd to my Free-hold, and they may as well take away my Free-hold, as my Right of Voting: And why should Religion be thrown as a Stumbling-Block in the Way of our civil Li∣berties?
<PB N="16" REF="15"/>
I do not vote as a <HI>Quaker,</HI> but as a <HI>Britain;</HI> and yet, my Friends, Religion is greatly concern'd herein, for could they have carry'd the Occasional Bill, or have mana∣ged the TACK, as they hop'd for, and expected, then the <HI>Tolleration-Act</HI> would soon have been repeal'd, and a more terrible Persecution would have follow'd, than either we, or our Fore-fathers ever knew or felt. And this brings me to the last Use of this Text which I propos'd, in which I shall be short; and which is,</P>
<P>Secondly, A Use of Exhortation. And certainly I believe every Friend here present knows within himself, that I mean to exhort you to PEACE and UNION among your selves, and to stand firm and fix'd to the Queen and her Interest; for in doing so, you not only do the Thing that is just and right, but you do Good to your selves, and your Posterity after you.</P>
<P>My Friends, we are the Children of the Light, and yet too too many of us have been in the Dark in Relation to Ci∣vil Affairs. The Eyes of our Understandings were never o∣pen'd that Way, 'till the last Election; and what open'd them then? Why, Occasional Bills, Tacks, and a dismal Prospect of Persecution; the Loss of our Queen and Govern∣ment were in View, as was a <HI>French</HI> Government and a Po∣pish Pretender. As they rous'd their wicked Natures against the Queen, her Government, and Ministry; so we rous'd our righteous Spirits on their Behalf, and united in their common Defence.</P>
<P>It was the first Time, that ever the Friends made fo good an Appearance at the Elections; they were united through∣out the Kingdom for the Queen and her Friends; very few went contrary, only such as were not thoroughly enlighten'd, as a few about <HI>Agmondesham,</HI> a Remnant, but small, in whom the Light only glia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mer'd, and shone not.</P>
<P>My Friends, to conclude, I humely desire, request, and intreat you, as you have receiv'd the Light, to walk worthy of it; not as in Darkness with the wicked Band of Tackers, but that you again will be industrious at the Elections in chusing the Queen's Friends, and Men of <HI>Moderation</HI> and <HI>Union;</HI> by this Means, you will rivet the Interest of the best of Queens, compleat your own Happiness, and frustrate the Designs of the Enemies of Queen and People. By this Means, you will secure to your Posterity the same Happiness your selves now enjoy, and in a few Years not so much as the Name of a TACKER shall be heard of in these Lands.</P>
