<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE following Work seems to have
as little need of a Preface as any
of the kind that has been pub∣lish'd
in this Age: It is hoped it
is it self but a Preface, or Intro∣duction
to some larger and fuller
History, that may, by better Hands, <HI>some time
or other,</HI> do Justice, not to the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
only, but to the Memory and Families of
the particular Sufferers and Confessors, who have
sacrificed themselves in Defence of Religion, in
that Part of <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>It is a moving Reflexion, that these larger and
fuller Accounts have been so often promised, and so
long ago undertaken by several able and Worthy
Hands, and that yet nothing has been finished, in
a Cause wherein History is so much in debt to
Truth; me see no full Account yet given, and 'tis
to be feared will not be given in our Age.</P>
<P>This Consideration has made an officious Stranger
concern him self in the Work; he could not bear to
think, that the Memory of the most glorious Scene
<HI>of Action,</HI> and the most dismal Scene of <HI>Suffer∣ing,</HI>
which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> has passed
<PB REF="3"/>
through, should lie buried in their own Ashes, and
not a Man to be found who would effectually em∣ploy
himself, and set seriously about the Work of
ransoming things of such Consequence from the
Grave of Forgetfulness.</P>
<P>For this Reason he has applied himself, by <HI>Books,</HI>
by just <HI>Authorities,</HI> by <HI>Oral-Tradition,</HI> by <HI>li∣ving
Witnesses,</HI> and by all other rational Means,
to make himself sufficiently Master of the <HI>Matters
of Fact;</HI> at least to furnish out Memoirs, tho' not a
perfect Mistory, of these Things; and to endeavour to
restore the general Knowledge of these great Trans∣actions
to the Use of Posterity, till some more large
and particular Account of these things shall appear.</P>
<P>I shall say nothing to the Performance, but this, that
I have endeavoured carefully to adhere to Truth of
Fact, and to have it told so evidently and clearly,
that it may not be misunderstood by the Ignorant, or
misrepresented by the malicious Part of Mankind in
Ages to come.</P>
<P>There is a Mistake in the Paging, and a great
Breach made in the Figures between the Second and
Third Parts of this Work, which may make some
suggest there is something omitted; but the Reader
is desired to observe, that there is no Breach of the
Story, and that the Reading goes on without Interru∣ption,
tho' the Figures seem to be a little confused,
which were occasioned only by the Mistake of the
Printers.</P>
<P>The Author recommends the Work to the Candor of
impartial Readers; and if any Mistakes are to be
found, tho' he has been critically careful to avoid
them, he desires they may be placed to the Account
of a disinterested Zeal to do Justice and Service to
the People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to a Cause which he had
too much at Heart to let lie neglected any longer,
how many Imperfections soever might happen in his
Performance.</P>

<HEAD>Of the CHURCH in her Infant State.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HOEVER enquires narrowly
into the Subject I am now entring
upon, I mean the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
will find it a meer <HI>Terra
incognita,</HI> a vast Continent of hid∣den,
undiscovered Novelties; and
will find himself surprised, to the last Degree, that
Things so near us should be so entirely hid from us.</P>
<P>Not that there is any thing monstrous or un∣heard
of in the Constitution or Circumstances of
<PB N="2" REF="5"/>
this Church, much less in her Profession and Pra∣ctise;
but that she has been represented to the
World in so many monstrous Shapes, drest up in
so many <HI>Devil's Coats,</HI> and <HI>Fool's Coats,</HI> charg'd
with so many Heresies, Errors, Schisms, and An∣tichristianisms
by the Mob of this slandering Ge∣neration,
that when a Man comes to view her in
her original Reformation, her subsequent Settle∣ment,
her many Revolutions, Convulsions, and
Catastrophe's in her subjected, persecuted State,
and now in her glorious Restroration and Esta∣blishment,
nothing can be more wonderful in
humane Affairs, than to see how Mankind has
been imposed upon about her, and with what
Front the Absurdities charg'd on her could be
broach'd in the World.</P>
<P>When we view the Soundness and Purity of her
<HI>DOCTRINE,</HI> the Strictness and Severity of
her <HI>DISCIPLINE,</HI> the Decency and Order
of her <HI>WORSHIP,</HI> the Gravity and Majesty
of her <HI>GOVERNMENT:</HI> When we see
the Modesty, Humility, and yet Steadiness of
her Assemblies; the Learning, Diligence, and
Painfulness of her Ministers; the awful Solem∣nity
of her Administration; the Obedience, Se∣riousness,
and Frequency of her People in hear∣ing,
and universally an Air of Sobriety and Gra∣vity
on the whole Nation; we must own her to
be, at this Time, the best regulated, national
Church in the World, without Reflection upon
any of the other Nations where the Protestant
Religion is establish'd and profess'd.</P>
<P>I am not comparing the Constitutions of
Churches, neither shall I enter into an invidi∣ous
Comparison here between the Circumstances
of this Church and the Church of <HI>England.</HI>—Let
them fight that Quarrel out with the Pen
and Ink by themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="6"/>
But this, I believe, I may challenge the Na∣tions
for, in the Name of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
That as to obeying their Constitution, as to
preserving the Purity of Doctrine and Worship,
as to enacting good Laws, and maintaining a
strict Observance of them, no Body of Men in
the World come up to them.</P>
<P>I know the Church of <HI>England</HI> have Canons
and Injunctions, which when People defend her,
they argue from; and those Canons and Injuncti∣ons
are far less liable to Objection, than those
who only guess by her Practice, may imagine:
For, when they come to examine how her Mini∣sters
obey those Canons, and how they are pu∣nish'd
when they break them, <HI>Hic labor, hoc o∣pus,</HI>
This is the most monstrous thing in the
World, and confirms what was said by a Divine
of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> (viz.) That no Nati∣on
or Church, in these Parts of the World,
have so good Laws so ill regarded as they<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See Dr. <HI>Edward's</HI> Testimony to the Discipline of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in his Sermon on the Union.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Nor shall I examin here whence a Thing so
justly scandalous to the Church of <HI>England</HI> pro∣ceeds;
'tis not the Work of this Piece, in which
the State of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> not of the
Church of <HI>England,</HI> is my Theme: But when
I have shewn therein the Advantages, which the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> reaps by a Strictness of Dis∣cipline,
peculiar to her self, and that Discipline
exactly executed in every Part; and how by
this she seems qualified to be the Chinch in the
World, the hardest to be invaded by Errors and
Schisms, and perfectly invulnerable by Heresies
and Corruptions, we must be very blind in <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
if we do not see, that the Slackness and
<PB N="4" REF="7"/>
Remisness in Discipline is the only Door at
which all the notorious Errors and Heresies,
now swarming in the <HI>English</HI> Church, are crept
in; such as Arianism, Socinianism, Arminianism,
Scepticism, Atheism, Deism, and the new ridi∣culous
Corruptions, Notions, and Novelties of
<HI>Dodwell, Coward, Asgill,</HI> and Others, who call
themselves of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and are
daily filling the World with Absurdities in Re∣ligion,
not fit to be suffered in a Protestant
Church or Government.</P>
<P>Did the Convocation of the Church of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
do their Duty, who often times sit long,
and do little; did they, in Time, check the
Growth of these Things; did they call in the
Aid of the Civil Authority, to curb the Exor∣bitance
of the Press, and exercise their Ecclesi∣astick
Authority in that of the Pulpit; in short,
were they as exact in their Discipline, as grave
in their Censures, and as strict in the Pursuit of
such Things as the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Errors
and Heresies would creep, like other venomous
Creatures, upon the Ground, grovel in the Dust,
and come out but in the Dark; such Crimes
would be acted as Crimes, and the Guilty would
hide themselves, like <HI>Adam,</HI> among the Bushes;
and not bully Religion, and affront God Al∣mighty
to his Face; laugh at Church Discipline,
and banter Civil Justice as now they do every Day.</P>
<P>But in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I take upon me with Boldness to
assure the World, it is not so; no Error broach∣ed,
lies brooding like hot Embers laid among
dry Buildings, neglected till it sets all in a
Flame: No ignorant Person can gain Admit∣tance
to, no immoral Person obtain Connivance
in the Pulpit; no Error there escapes Censure,
no Censure dies there for Want of Prosecution.
<PB N="5" REF="8"/>
If any Breach be made, the Church Judicatories
never fail to keep it in the stated Forms of
Proceeding, where it cannot sleep; the guilty
Person must be brought either to Repentance
or to Punishment.</P>
<P>If there is any Breach in this Order, any
Stop in the free Exercise of their Authority, or
any Interruption to the full Extent of the
Church's Power in Censure, it proceeds either
(1.) from the exorbitant Power of the Gentry and
Nobility, who, often especially when their own
Guilt is the Question, stand out to Extremity
against Church-Censures, and think themselves
too great for the Authority of the Ecclesiastick
Judicatories.—Or (2.), from the Looseness of
the Episcopal Dissenters, who, as they separate
in Worship, so they would be understood to
be excused from Discipline.—Of both which
I shall speak at large in their Place, and only
note it here, That even in both these Cases, there
are Instances wherein the highest and most ob∣stinate
have thought fit to submit to the Disci∣pline
of the Church, either convinc'd of its
Justice, or loath to have the just Reproach of
the Opposition entailed upon their Posterity.—In
which Case <HI>Scotland</HI> is not without Instances,
where her Noblemen have accepted a Rebuke
for the Breaches of their Morals in the open
Congregation.—But of all this I shall be more
particular in its Place.</P>
<P>In these Judicatories the admirable Order of
Proceeding is such, that it seems impossible any
Man can be opprest; for he is able to appeal
so often, the Cause shall be heard so often, and
by such different Judges, that he cannot fail of
Justice. On the other Hand, the Subordination
of Judicatories is such, and the Proceedings so
<PB N="6" REF="9"/>
nicely accounted for by the Kirk-Sessions to the
presbyteries, by the Presbyteries to the Pro∣vincial
Synods, and by the Synods to the Gene∣ral
Assemblies, that there can no Mistake pass
unobserved, no Complaint can pass unheard, no
Grievance unrectified.</P>
<P>I shall not insist on the Particulars here; be∣cause
I shall give it at large in the Scheme I pur∣pose
to draw of the State of these Judicatories
in this Church; to which I refer.</P>
<P>But what I am upon here is, that by this
Means you have the fewest Breaches made upon
this Church by the Defection or Degeneracy of
either Ministers or people, among themselves, of
any Church in the World; and this, I believe,
will very remarkably appear in the subsequent
Sheets.</P>
<P>To give a true and concise Scheme of the State
of this Church, it will be needful to go back to
its original Constitution, which I shall only a∣bridge,
and take no more of it, than is needful to
hand down a right understanding of its Cir∣cumstances
to the present Time. And this is
the Design of these Memoirs.</P>
<P>It began to reform from Popery in the Year
1557, being sometime before the Reformation in
<HI>England.</HI> Not but that the Seeds of the Protestant
Religion were sown, and the Protestant Doctrine
spread very far in private even before that; as
may appear by the several Confessors for the
Truth, who were put to Death under the Ad∣ministration
of the Queen-Regent, by the Assi∣stance
and particular Fury of the Cardinal <HI>Be∣ton,</HI>
of which presently.</P>
<P>But this will be farther evident by entring into
an Examination of Matters in <HI>England.</HI> For after
the Death of <HI>James</HI> V, <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, K. of <HI>England,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="10"/>
sending Ambassadors openly to treat of a Mar∣riage<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">King <HI>Hen. VIII.</HI> sont Ja. 5th Books, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> See <HI>Buch.</HI> lib. 14. fol. 63.</NOTE>
for his Son, with the Queen of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
the said Treaty and Marriage being proposed in
Parliament, was so openly contradicted by the
Priests in general, with the Queen Dowager,
a <HI>French</HI> Woman, and Cardinal <HI>Beton</HI> at the
Head of them, that the Cardinal was consined
till the Question was put in the parliament.</P>
<P>And tho' when the Cardinal was thus remo∣ved,
the Matter was soon concluded, yet the
Cardinal making his Escape out of Prison, he
and the Popish Faction so ordered Affairs that
the Articles could never be executed, nor the
Hostages, agreed on, obtained.</P>
<P>A cruel War followed on this, the King of
<HI>England</HI> resenting all these Indignities: Which
War, and the Calamities it brought with it, to∣gether
with the Confusions in the Regency of
the Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> occasioned by the Policy
and Cruelty of the Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> gave the Peo∣ple
a greater liberty than otherwise they would
have had; so that the Protestant Religion, then
particularly called <HI>Lutheranism,</HI> got a great deal
of Ground; and not only were the common Peo∣ple
enclined to it, but a great many of the No∣bility
and Gentry of <HI>Scotland</HI> favoured the Re∣formation:
Nay, so far had it obtained, that
some Towns began to own it in Bulk: And <HI>Bu∣chanan</HI>
records it, and from him I hand it
down to Posteriry for the particular Honour of
the Town of <HI>Dundee,</HI> that they were the only
Town in <HI>Scotland</HI> that was then addicted to the
<PB N="8" REF="11"/>
<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Buch. lib. 15. fal. 157.—Sed Cardinalis, parum tutum ratus duos Homines nobiles, &amp; factiosos, &amp; bene Comitatos in opidum recipere, unum instairatoe religioni addictissimum, egit cum prorege, ut <HI>Pertham</HI> rediret.</NOTE> Protestant Religion: Or, which the Sense
will very well bear if the History of the Time
be examined, the Town of <HI>Dundee</HI> was the first
Protestant Town in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and therefore the
Cardinal would not venture to receive the Earl
of <HI>Rothes</HI> and <HI>Patrick Gray,</HI> who, it seems, fa∣vour'd
the Reformation, in that Town, but
fled to <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Time when, at <HI>Perth,</HI> they burnt
a Woman and her Infant, because she would
not call on the <HI>Virgin-Mary</HI> when she was in
Travel.—And having vowed the Destruction
of the Reformed, they came to <HI>Dundee,</HI> to search
for such as read the New Testament: And then
it was that they raised<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Tanta{que} erat Coecitas, ut Sacerdotum pleri{que} contenderent, Novum Testamentum nuper à <HI>Martino Luthero</HI> fuisse seriptum. <HI>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id.</HI> Fol. 157.</NOTE> a Report among the
poor People, that the New Testament was writ∣ten
by Luther and therefore to be rejected as
an heretical Book. But, it seems, the honest
People of Dundee like true <HI>Bereans,</HI> enquired
farther into the <HI>Matter, and have retained their
better Knowledge to this Day.</HI></P>
<P>That the Popish Clergy apprehended a general
Revolution in the Affairs or Religion, and law
a strong Inclination to that Change in the Peo∣ple,
was apparent from their Vigilanee and
Subtilty in rejecting the Offer of an Intermar∣riage
with <HI>England,</HI> first made by King <HI>Henry</HI>
VIII, in the Time of <HI>James</HI> V of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
afterwards their running headlong into a War
<PB N="9" REF="12"/>
with <HI>England,</HI> rather than consent to match
their Queen, then an Infant, to Prince <HI>Edward,</HI>
afterwards <HI>Edward</HI> VI, King of <HI>England.</HI> The true
Reason of which appeared to be, least the <HI>English</HI>
Reformation should be imposed upon them.</P>
<P>This Obstinacy was so great, as that had
the <HI>English</HI> pursued their Design with Force,
after the Battle at <HI>Pinky,</HI> they might have
ruined <HI>Scotland</HI> very much, their Queen be∣ing
a Child, and the Mobility much divided
among themselves.—And yet the <HI>Scots,</HI> tho'
their Army was overthrown, and their Coun∣try
over-run by the <HI>English</HI> rejected the Match,
and privily conveyed their young Queen into
<HI>France.</HI> And all this for fear of a Reformation.</P>
<P>This was all from the Subtilty of the Popish
Clergy, as is evident through the whole Course of
the Histories of those Times.—The Priests had in
vain opposed the growing Reformation with the
unprevailing Remedies of Fire and Faggot: The
burning of <HI>Patrick Hamilton,</HI> at St. <HI>Andrews;</HI> a
Gentleman of noble Extract, was rather a Help
than a Hindrance to the Reformation; of whom
<HI>George Buchanan</HI> says, he dy'd by the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Buchanan. rerum Scoticarum,</HI> lib. 14. fol. 146. Eo quo{que} anno, <HI>Patricius Hamiltonius</HI> è <HI>Johanms Ducis Albani sorore,</HI> ex fratre <HI>Comitis Araniae, natus,</HI> Juvenis ingenio summo &amp; eruditione sigulari, conjuratione Saeerdotum oppressus, as Fanum Andreoe vivus est crematus.</NOTE> <HI>Conspira∣cy
of the Priests.</HI> And the Story of the <HI>Domini∣can</HI>
Friar, whom he having convinced of the
Truth of his Doctrine, afterwards betrayed him,
and witnessed against him, is very remarkable:
For when <HI>Patrick Hamilton,</HI> at his Death, appeal∣ed
to his Conference that he believed, and was
convinc'd of the Truth of what he persecuted
<PB N="10" REF="13"/>
him for, the Friar, struck with the Conviction,
ran distracted immediately, and died mad.—
This, says the same Author<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> Animos Hominum conterruit Alexandri Cambelli Mors.
See the Story in <HI>Buchanan,</HI> fol. 146. Is erat <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>egrave; Sodalitio Dominicanorum—to mortem obiit—</NOTE>, much terrified
the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>Afterwards in the Year 1539, Five more were

and some recanted. Among the Banish∣ed

<P>How the Priests managed King <HI>James</HI> the V, a
Prince, as <HI>Buchanan</HI> says<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">His velut machinis admotis cum regis animum superstitionibus ohnoxium labefactassent, turn corruptis, qui plurimum poteretnt aulicis, magnain per eos regi pecunioe vim polliciti, penitus cum a collowuio averterunt, <HI>Ibid.</HI> fol. 149.</NOTE>, naturally superstiti∣ous;
how they corrupted his Courtiers, how
they flattered him on the giving to them the
Books sent him by the King of <HI>England;</HI> how
they, by the meer Force of Money, prevailed
upon him first to delay, and afterwards to break
off “the Enterview appointed between him and
the King of <HI>England,</HI> and how all this was for
Fear of the growing Reformation in <HI>England,</HI>
and the introducing it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> is so plain in
History, that I need only refer the Readers to
the Particulars which they will find in <HI>Calder∣wood,
Spotswood,</HI> and <HI>Buchanan,</HI> the last of whom,
(<HI>viz.) Buchanan,</HI> speaks it plainly, that the Priests
<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Demum Sacerdetes,qui pro aris ac focis sibi certandum videbant, <HI>Jacobum Betonium Fani Andreae</HI> Achiepiscopum &amp; <HI>Georgium Crichtonium</HI> Caledonioe Episcopum, senes invalidos, ad aulam pertraxerant, freere religionem, hoc congressu prodi, <HI>&amp;c. Ibid.</HI> fol. 149.</NOTE> had this in their View.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="14"/>
And yet in all this, <HI>Scotland</HI> had an unfore∣seen
Advantage, <HI>viz.</HI> That having been obli∣ged,
by these things, to defer the Reformation, I
mean, as a publick Action; they had Leisure
thereby to see the Defects of the <HI>English</HI> Refor∣mation,
which happened in the mean time, and
going a Step farther, to leave out some Things
which the <HI>English</HI> retained; and which, by the
Error of the Times, got such deep Root there,
as never to be altered to this Day: Such as the
Supremacy, prescribed Rites and Ceremonies,
and which they esteem'd also a Defect, <HI>Epis∣copacy:</HI>
Which Things, as they began now
to be objected against in <HI>England</HI> by several of
the best and most eminent for Piety in the first
Reformation, so they obtained not at all in
<HI>Scotland</HI> but; <HI>John Knox,</HI> whom, for this, I
think I may call the Father of the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> going over to <HI>Geneva,</HI> and there con∣ferring
with the most eminent Protestant Di∣vines
concerning the Model of Church Govern∣ment,
which should be most agreeable to Scri∣pture-Institution,
he brought over the Figure of a
Church as to Worship, Discipline, and Govern∣ment,
the same which we find now establish'd.</P>
<P>It would be too long a Work for these Me∣moirs
to set down here the Beginning, Progress,
Manner, and Issue of the first Reformation: It
may be sufficient to note here the Heads of it,
and withal, the different Manner of it from that
in <HI>England,</HI> which produced that Effect mention∣ed
above, <HI>viz.</HI> a differing Form of Settlement.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="15"/>
In <HI>England</HI> the Reformation, as to the Settle∣ment
of it, began in the Crown, the several
Kings put the first Hand to it: As 1. King <HI>Hen∣ry</HI>
VIII, by dethroning the Pope's Supremacy,
demolishing the religious Houses, forbidding
Appeals to <HI>Rome,</HI> and the like. 2. King <HI>Edward</HI>
VI, by a general Overthrow of all the Popish
Hierarchy, casting their Images out of the
Churches, their Mass, and all their <HI>Romish</HI>
Innovations out of their Worship, dethroning
their whole Authority, and rooting out the
Remains of their Ceremonies from the Nation.</P>
<P>But this had two Effects.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That when King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII abolish'd the
Pope's Supremacy, his Principle at that time be∣ing
rather Politick than Religious, he set his
own Authority up in the stead of it, calling him∣self
supream Head of the Church in all Things,
whether Ecclesiastical or Civil; a Thing since
made very ill use of, and improve'd to a Tyran∣ny,
which neither in the Divine or Humane
Original of it could find any legal Foundation.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That when King <HI>Edward</HI> rejected the Pon∣tificate
of <HI>Rome,</HI> he yet erected a Protestant
Pontificate in its stead, which being soon oppo∣sed
by some of the most eminent for Piety and
Wisdom in the Reformation, quickly begot a
Division in the Church, which has since been
carried on to that Heighth, and encreased to the
Magnitude which we see this Day.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. King <HI>Edward,</HI> and the first Reformers,
when they came to the Matters of Worship, did
not wholly destroy the Model, but reform'd it

the Extent of their Light, honestly design'd to
leave out all that was superstitious and idola∣trous
in the former, and did really believe it
<PB N="13" REF="16"/>
was so; yet they thought themselves obliged to
retain a Similitude of Form.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Nor do we since so much object against the
Form, less against a Form in general; but a∣gainst
prescribing that Form as a Term of Com∣munion.</P>
<P>These are the Three Heads which have since
caused so much Dispute in <HI>England,</HI> made un∣happy
Breaches in the common Charity, and
risen up to such large Divisions as we see at
this Day.</P>
<P>But to return to the <HI>Scots,</HI> their Reformation
began quite in another Manner.—The Know∣ledge
of the Scriptures began the first Step to it,
and the <HI>English</HI> Bible got in among the People ve∣ry
quickly: Some eminent, for Learning, even
among the Popish Zealots, began to be enlight∣ed
by the Reading the Word of God: And as
Knowledge is naturally diffusive, so this Kind,
having an invisible Instructor to second it, I
mean the holy Spirit of God, spread secretly,
but swiftly, through the Nation.</P>
<P>Among those, whom it pleased God to make
use of as the first Instruments in this glorious
Work, was <HI>George Wishart,</HI> and several others,
who became eminent: They were bold and steady
Preachers of the Reformation, and the People
of all sorts became so addicted to the Protestant
Religion, by their Instruction, that after the Re∣gent,
by the Instigation of Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> had
consented to the Martyrdom of that great
and good man Mr. <HI>Wishart, Buchanan</HI> tells us the
whole Nation began to<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Buch.</HI> lib. 15. fol. 163.

<P><PB N="14" REF="17"/>
'Twould be endless to recite the Names;
Lives, and Death of the many Preachers who,
at first, with the extremest Hazard, and with a
Constancy, even to Martyrdom, spread the
reformed Doctrines through <HI>Scotland.</HI> It suf∣fices
to note, that in a few Years it had such Suc∣cess,
that in general the whole Kingdom seem∣ed
to be touch'd with the Sense of the true
Religion, and not the common People only, but
the Nobility and Gentry embraced it with great
Zeal, Eagerness, and Resolution; and in this
Case the Affairs of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> stood,
when the Regent was persuaded by the <HI>French</HI>
Court to demit, and to resign his Government
into the Hands of the Queen Mother.—.</P>
<P>This Lady being wholly <HI>French</HI> and acted by
their Counsels, set her self with more Heat, than
Discretion, to suppress the reformed Religion,
and, <HI>as she f<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>attered her self,</HI> to extirpate the Begin∣nings
of it out of <HI>Scotland;</HI> but she found her
self mistaken, it was now too late; the Thing
had taken too deep Root in the Hearts of the
People for her to master it.</P>
<P>However, for Two Years, Matters of Re∣ligion
slept, the Queen being married to
the Dauphin of <HI>France,</HI> the Regent taken up
by a War with <HI>England:</HI> And the Clergy,
tho' cruel and bloody enough, yet being baulk∣ed
by the Murther of Cardinal <HI>Beton,</HI> (who was
slain in his Bed-Chamber, as <HI>George Wishart</HI> had
<PB N="15" REF="18"/>
predicted, and cast out of a Window by <HI>Norman
Lesley,</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> and his Follow∣ers)
they wanted a Head to prosecute the Refor∣mers
to Blood, and a Power to protect them in it.</P>
<P>All this while the Reformed held their pri∣vate
Assemblies, where they had their Worship
in their own Language, and had frequent Con∣ferences
upon religious Matters; for as yet they
had no publick Preaching: However, by this
Means the Work of Reformation still spead it
self, and took deep Root in the Nation.</P>
<P>The first popular Discovery this made in the
Minds of the Commonality was, in the City
of <HI>Edenburgh,</HI> when the Shrine of St. <HI>Giles,</HI> the
Patron of that City, was robbed of its Relicks,
which they had in so much Veneration.</P>
<P>The 1st of <HI>September,</HI> it seems, was the Fe∣stival
of this tutelar Saint, when his Image was
to be carried in Procession about the City, and
the Queen Regent resolved to be present at the
Solemnity: But when they came to look for the
Saint, he was pleased to suffer himself to be sto∣len
away, to the great Confusion of the Clergy,
who had pleased themselves with the Expectati∣on
of the Procession, and the Honour done them
by the Regent to grace the Show.</P>
<P>However, to make up the Matter as well as
they could, they made another Image to set in
the Pageant, and began their Procession in the
usual Form.—After the Show had passed the
principal Parts of the City, and the Queen Re∣gent
was retired, the Mob rose upon the Priests,
and put an End to their Pageantry: For they
pulled St. <HI>Giles</HI> out of his Throne, which was
erected on the Shoulders of the Priests, threw
his Saintship into the Dirt, and in short, the sa∣cred
Image suffered immediate Martyrdom. But
<PB N="16" REF="19"/>
the Priests had no Mind to die with their Deity;
for they fled every Man as he could.—And yet
this they need not have done, for the Rabble of∣fered
no Body any Injury but the wooden Idol,
which they broke all to pieces, and so departed.</P>
<P>This, however, might give the Regent a Taste
of what Posture the Affairs of Religion were
in, if she had pleased to have taken Notice of it.
However, she countenanced the Priests to go on
with all the persecuting Methods they could,
tho' every where they met with Insults, Slights,
and Contempt from the People: As particularly
When citing <HI>Paul Meffen</HI> of <HI>Dundee</HI> before them,
and he not appearing, was intercommoned; that
is, every one was forbid to harbour, or relieve
him, or converse with him, on severe Penalties:
which yet the brave Citizens of <HI>Dundee</HI> open∣ly
disregarded, and protected him, entertained
him in their Houses, and sued to the Regent to
remit his Banishment.</P>
<P>But things were now coming to a greater
Height; for the Asserters of the reformed
Religion resolved not to bear any longer the
Oppressions and Invasions of the Clergy, but to
demand their Liberty in a different Manner
from what had formerly been done.</P>
<P>They had calculated their Right first, and
then their Strength: They found that if they
were proceeded against by Law, they could not
be hurt, for they had offended no Law; and if
their Enemies had recourse to Arms, they were
more numerous than they, and would defend
themselves. Upon these Resolutions, several
were sent abroad by their Brethren to concert
Measures, and to form themselves into some∣thing
of a Body.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="20"/>
These were eminent Persons, as <HI>Buchanan</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. 16. fol. 167. Inter hoec quidam viri nobiles è <HI>Fifa</HI> maxime &amp; <HI>Angusia,</HI> ac aliquot opidorum cives illustriores.</NOTE>

alledge, that the Reformation in <HI>Scotland</HI> was
the Effect only of the Fury of the Rabble.—
They went severally, to the remotest Parts of
the Kingdom<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">In omnes Scotiae praefecturas dispersi hortabantur universos ut sinceram divinae legis praedicationem amarent, <HI>Ibid.</HI> fol. 167.</NOTE>, moving the Gentlemen and

as they were sure to do. And to this was added
the Assurance, as it was call'd, which some call'd
the first Covenant, and is as follows:</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The first Covenant of Scotland, 1557.</HEAD>
<P>“WE perceiving how Sathan in his Mem∣bers,
the Antichrists of our Time, cru∣elly
does rage, seeking to overthrow and destroy
the Gospel of Christ, and his Congregation,
ought, according to our bounden Duty, to strive
in our Master's Cause, even unto the Death,
being certain of the Victory in him: The which
<PB N="18" REF="21"/>
our Duty being well considered, we do promise,

forward, and establish the most blessed Word

do join us; and so do forsake and renounce the
Congregation of Sathan, with all the superstiti∣ous
Abomination and Idolatry thereof. And
moreover, shall declare our selves manifestly
Enemies thereto, by this our faithful Promise
before God, testified to this Congregation, by
our Subscription of these presents. At <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>

Et caetera.</Q>
<P>Soon after this they sent their Proposals to
the Queen Regent by Sir <HI>James Sandelands</HI> of <HI>Cal∣der,</HI>
which contained in short these Particulars.</P>
<P>1. “That the Worship of God, Prayers and
Sacraments might be had in the vulgar Tongue.”</P>
<P>2. “That scandalous Ministers might be re∣mov'd.”</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="22"/>
3. “That the People might have the Choice
of their own Ministers.”</P>
<P>This was called the Oration and Petition of
the Protestants of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Queen Regent,
and is at length printed in the said History of the
Reformation, <HI>lib.</HI> 2. p. 127, 128, 129. But is
too long to recite here.</P>
<P>The Parliament soon after this sat down,
which was in <HI>December Anno</HI> 1558, and the
Reformers presented a Letter to them also,
including their Requests, and annexed to it a
solemn Protestation, which they demanded to
be registred at the same Time that they deliver∣ed
it.</P>
<P>The Regent's Answer to this Protestation
was mild, and such as deceived the Reformers
for a while: Her Answer was thus—<HI>Me will
remember what is protest. Me sal put good Order in
all thing that now controverse. Note,</HI> the Regent
was a <HI>French</HI> Woman, and spoke broken <HI>En∣glish.</HI></P>
<P>The Regent all this while dealt cautiously and
subtilly; for she guess'd wisely that the People
who durst make these Demands, must have
some Prospect of Power to support them; and
she dreaded the Tumults of the Rabble: She
therefore consented, in Shew, to some things, as
particularly, to let them have their Worship in
the vulgar Tongue, on Condition it should be
without Tumult, and that they should not preach
publickly in <HI>Leith</HI> or <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>For some time, it seems, <HI>the Reformed</HI> con∣tented
themselves with this, and kept the In∣junctions
of the Regent exactly; but the Priests
were furious, to the last Degree, at these things,
and made all possible Opposition, till at last
they drove things to the Extremities which
<PB N="20" REF="23"/>
followed, and pav'd the Way for their own
Overthrow.</P>
<P>They held their Meetings to consult for the
Suppressing the Reformed, and had all the As∣sistance
underhand that the <HI>Queen Regent</HI> could
give them; but she still carried it fair to the
Reformers, and answered them mildly, lead∣ing
them on in Hopes.</P>
<P>At last she threw off the Mask, and openly
profest her Resolution to destroy them; that
she would not suffer the Majesty of the Govern∣ment
to be debased, but would restore it to
its ancient Veneration by some remarkable
Thing.</P>
<P>I am content to acknowledge I follow <HI>Bu∣chanan</HI>
in these Notes upon the Affairs of those
Days; because tho' other Historians are more
particular than he, yet the Enemies of the
Reformation are not without Objections against
the Reputation of their Writings, whereas <HI>Bu∣chanan</HI>'s
Reputation, as an Historian, is unque∣stioned,
even by his greatest Enemies. I find
them also all agree, in Substance, with him.
He is also concise, and more pertinent than
some of them; and all Sides acknowledge him to
be authentick and faithful. <HI>But this by the Way.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen, as I have noted, dealt for a while
mildly with the Reformers, but it lasted not
long; for they were obliged to come to a Point
with her; And therefore not to be wanting to
themselves, as well as at the same Time to be∣have
decently to the Regent, they sent the Earl
of <HI>Glencairn, Hugh Campbell,</HI> Sheriff of <HI>Air,</HI> and
others, to entreat her favourable Answer to
their Desires.</P>
<P>The Queen Regent, now casting off the
Mask, gave her Passion a full Vent, and told
<PB N="21" REF="24"/>
them<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. 16. fol. 168. Ibi non se potuit continere, quin vocem impietatis testem profundere<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Invitis, inquit, vobis, vestrisque ministris isti, ersi Paulo sincerius concionabuntur, tamen exulabunt.</NOTE>, in so many Words, they had nothing
to expect from her.—They calmly reminded
her of her Promises to them, but in vain: She
told them in effect<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Respondit, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dem promissorum a principibus exigendam, quatenus eam praestare commodum eis videretur. <HI>Ib.</HI></NOTE>, <HI>Princes were not bound by
the Promises which they were obliged to make in
the Exigence of their Affairs.</HI>—The Protestants
finding such Usage as this, and knowing as well
what they were to expect, as their own Strength
to resist it, <HI>boldly defyed her,</HI> and told her to
her Face<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ad haec illi subjecerunt, Se ergo omne obsequium &amp; par<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n∣di necessitatem ei renunciare, atque proemonuerunt, quantum in∣commodorum esset ab hoc fonte Emanaturam. <HI>Ib.</HI></NOTE>, that they then renounced all Obe∣dience
to her, and advised her to consider the
Consequences of it.</P>
<P>Now the Fire was kindled, and the Flame be∣gan
to burn out, and tho' the Queen Regent was
rather enraged by their Boldness than made
<HI>thoughtful,</HI> yet she soon found the Differences
of Things; she found her Authority to de∣crease,
and her Commands every where slight∣ed:
<HI>For Example,</HI> she commanded the <HI>Provost</HI> of
St. <HI>Johnston,</HI> now called <HI>Perth,</HI> to suppress the
Innovation of Religion there; he answered, that
he had no Dominion <HI>over their Consciences:</HI> She
commanded the Sheriff of <HI>Dundee</HI> to send <HI>Paul
Meffen,</HI> their Protestant Minister, bound to her,
instead of which the Sheriff sent to Mr. <HI>Meffen,</HI>
to tell him, that he might secure himself: She
wrote to the Neighbour Assemblies, to observe
<PB N="22" REF="25"/>
<HI>Easter</HI> as usual, after the <HI>Roman</HI> way, but not
one of them obeyed her.</P>
<P>Upon this she cited all the Ministers of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to appear at <HI>Stirling,</HI> on the 10th of <HI>May</HI>
1559; but they came there with such Atten∣dants,
and so numerous, <HI>tho' unarm'd;</HI> that it fright∣ed
the Regent out of her Design, and made her
entreat <HI>John Ereskine</HI> of <HI>Dun,</HI> a Lover of the
Religion, and that could influence them by him∣self,
that he would disperse the People, giving
her Promise at the same Time to act Nothing
against the Reformers.—But see the Faith kept
at that Time with Protestants: As soon as on
those Promises the honest Men were returned
home, she held the Meeting intended, called over
the Names, and outlawed those that were ab∣sent
for Contempt.</P>
<P>The Nobility and Gentry assembled with the
Ministers, finding in what Manner they were
to be used, that the Queen was wholly beut
for their Destruction, and neither to be bound
by Promises, or any other Obligation, and that
their Ruin was absolutely determined, prepared
for Force, resolving to defend themselves.</P>
<P>And now began the Fury of the People to
break out a little beyond the Bounds which the
better<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ort designed; for the Mob at <HI>Perth,</HI> says
<HI>Buchanan,</HI> on Mr. <HI>John Knox</HI>'s preaching a Sermon
to them against Idolatry, took Fire at the Hint,
and immediately fell to breaking down the I∣mages
in all the Churches and Monasteries at
<HI>Perth,</HI> Other Historians say, This was upon
the Laird of <HI>Dun</HI>'s giving them an Account of
the Falshood and Injustice of the Queen to the
Ministers<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at the Meeting at <HI>Sterling,</HI> and give
a very particular Account, introduced thus:
“The Laird of <HI>Dun,</HI> coming to St. <HI>John∣ston,
<PB N="23" REF="26"/>
Johnston,</HI> exposed the Case even as it was, and
did conceal nothing of the Queen's Craft and
Falsehood, which being understood, the Multi∣tude
was so inflamed, that neither could the
Exhortation of the Preachers, nor the Com∣mandment
of the Magistrates stay them from
destroying the Places of Idolatry.” <HI>Vide Knox</HI>'s
History of the Reformation, <HI>lib. 2. fol.</HI> 136. Be
it which Way it will, <HI>whether</HI> by Mr. <HI>Knox</HI>'s Ser∣mon,

Rubbish; so that in some Places they hardly
left any Remembrance of them to Posterity.</P>
<P>And now the War was begun in earnest; for
the breaking down of Images, and pulling
<PB N="24" REF="27"/>
down Monasteries began to spread over the
whole Country: The Town of <HI>Cowper</HI> followed
that of <HI>Perth,</HI> and the Friars and Ecclesiasticks
began every where to shift for themselves, all
the rest being apprehensive, and not without good
Cause, of the same Fate.</P>
<P>The Regent, exasperated to the highest De∣gree,
solemnly swore she would be reveng'd on
the City of <HI>Perth,</HI> that she would have the
Blood of the Citizens, and burn their City
down to the Ground; But she reckon'd without
her Host; for the People let her see how little
they feared her; for that the very same Week
several other Towns did the like.—In order
therefore to put a Stop to this Sort of Work,
she raised an Army, and marched directly a∣gainst
the Protestant Mobility, who, by the way,
had ever since the Association, I mentioned be∣fore,
been called <HI>The Lords of the CONGRE∣GATION:</HI>
And the Protestants in general, as
then united, were called <HI>The CONGREGA∣TION.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Congregation,</HI> for so I shall
now call them, far from being discouraged at
the Regent's Preparations, sent Messengers to all
their Brethren to come and stand by what they
had begun, and not to desert so good a Cause in
its last Extremity. And this had such an Ef∣fect,
that they had soon a very good Army, and
'tis recorded, to the Honour of the Earl of
<HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>encairn,</HI> that he brought with him 21<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>O Men,
well armed, to their Assistance.</P>
<P>The Queen Regent had rather more Forces
than the <HI>Congregation,</HI> including her <HI>French Aux∣iliaries,</HI>
but yet she was loth to venture a Bat∣tle;
but sends Two Gentlemen who were in
her Army, and who were Favourers of the Re∣formed,

<HI>James Stuart,</HI> and <HI>Gillespy Campbel,</HI> and they to

<P>These made, says <HI>Buchanan,</HI> a temporary A∣greement;
for indeed it was no more. It a∣mounted
to a disbanding the Troops on either
Side, the Queen was to be admitted into <HI>Perth,</HI>
on her Promise not to injure any of the Towns∣men,
her <HI>French</HI> Troops were not to come with∣in
Three Miles of the Town, and all religious
Differences were to be left to the next Parlia∣ment.</P>
<P>Thus the War, which was just breaking out,
was seemingly stopt for a while; but the Queen
Regent kept not one of her Articles; for she
brought her <HI>Frenchmen</HI> into the City, she exerci∣sed
all Sorts of Violence on the Citizens, and
fell on them by Fines at Pleasure, Change of
their Magistrates, Banishment of some, and
Murther of others, and, at her Departure, left
a Garrison of Mercenaries in the Town.</P>
<P>This Treatment of the Citizens of <HI>Perth,</HI> fi∣nished
the Ruin of all the Regent's Affairs, and
this was the last Day of her Prosperity; for
now her Friends began to for sake her; the Lord

<P>It should be noted here, that at the breaking up
of the Meeting of the Lords of the <HI>Congregation</HI> at
<HI>Perth,</HI> when that City was yielded to the Queen
Regent, there was another Writing subscribed
which Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> calls the <HI>Second Covenant,</HI> and
was for mutual Assistance: And to this the
Earl of <HI>Argyle</HI> and Lord <HI>James Stuart</HI> signed,
having before promised, if the Queen broke her
Word to the Citizens of St. <HI>Johnston,</HI> they
would join with all their Power with <HI>the Con∣gregation,</HI>
as now they did together with the
Lord <HI>Ruthwen,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Menteth,</HI> and Lord
<HI>Tullibardin.</HI> The Queen sent after them, requi∣ring
them to return, on pain of Displeasure;
<PB N="27" REF="30"/>
but they boldly rejected her, sending her Word
plainly, that, with safe Conscience, they could
not be partakers with her in so manifest Ty∣ranny
as was by her practised, <HI>Knox lib. 2. p.</HI> 152.</P>
<P>The Second Covenant was as follows:</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>The Second Covenant at Perth, 1559.</HEAD>
<P>“AT <HI>Perth</HI> the last of <HI>May,</HI> the Yeere of God

Perth, Dundie, Angus, Mernes,</HI> and <HI>Monrosse,</HI> be∣ing
convened in the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> in the Name

commanded by God, are confederate, and be∣come

<P>The Queen was now in <HI>Fife,</HI> marching to
<HI>Cowper,</HI> and from thence intending to St. <HI>An∣drews,</HI>
where the Lords having designed to go
on with the Reformation, had brought Mr. <HI>John
Knox</HI> to preach against Idolatry; but the Bi∣shop,
terrified with the Thoughts of Reforma∣tion
in his Cathedral-Church, hasted thither
with 100 Spearmen, and came into the Town
the Evening before. The two Lords, and their
Friends, had no Soldiers, Only their meer
Houshold-Servants, and the Queen with her
Army was but 12 Miles off, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Faulkland,</HI>
nor was the Town yet confirmed in the reform∣ed
Religion, and to compleat all, the Arch-Bi∣shop,
who had before caused <HI>John Knox</HI> to be
burnt in Effigie, sent them Word by Mr. <HI>Robert
Coldwell,</HI> Laird of <HI>Clesse,</HI> That if <HI>KNOX da∣red
to present himself to the Preaching-Place in his
Town and Church, he would cause him to be saluted
with a Dozen of Culverins, the most Part of which
should light upon his Nose.</HI> The Lords delibera∣ted
on the Matter, and most were for not expo∣sing
Mr. <HI>Knox;</HI> but when they came to consult
him he valued no Threats, bat<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Knox</HI>'s Hist. of Reform. lib. 2. fol. 153.</NOTE> boldly re∣solved
<PB N="29" REF="32"/>
to preach, and did preach, and preached
against Idolatry from that Text in <HI>Matt.</HI> of the
Ejection of the Buyers and Sellers from the Tem∣ple.
In this Sermon he shewed the Duty of Magi∣strates
and People to pull down Idolatry, and this
he did with such Vehemence, and it had such an
Effect upon the People, that not only the common
People, but the Provost, Bailies, and Magistrates
resolved to remove all the Monuments of Idola∣try
in that Place, and performed it accordingly;
the Bishop taking Sanctuary with the Queen,
who lay with her Army then at <HI>Faulkland,</HI> as
before. The Queen, tho' she had no great Kind∣ness
for the Bishop, yet <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heard him upon this
Occasion with great Concern and Attention, and
resolved immediately to advance with her Army
to St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> to punish the Offenders with
the utmost Severity, and accordingly ordered
her Army to march.</P>
<P>As the Queen was drawing towards them
with her Forces, so they, <HI>as before,</HI> had sent about
to all the rest of the <HI>Congregation,</HI> desiring them
with all possible Speed to come to their Assi∣stance;
which they did with such Speed, that
by the next Day they encreased from about
300 Men, Horse and Foot, to above 3000 well
mounted and accoutred, and among them were
some of the most eminent of the Nobility, such
as the Earl of <HI>Rothes,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ruthwen,</HI> the Earl
of <HI>Argyle,</HI> the Lord <HI>James Stuart,</HI> Earl of <HI>Glen∣cairn,</HI>
and others.</P>
<P>The Queen's Army marched all Night to
surprize them, but found they had Intelligence
of her March, were drawn up ready to of∣fer
her Battle, and resolved to give her a warm
Reception: The Earl of <HI>Ruthwen</HI> led the Gen∣tlemen
of <HI>Fife, Angus,</HI> and <HI>Mearns,</HI> who made
<PB N="30" REF="33"/>
a Thousand Spears on Horseback: The Towns
of <HI>Dundie</HI> and St. <HI>Andrews</HI> made a good Bri∣gade
of Foot, and were drawn up by themselves.</P>
<P>When the Queen's Men saw the Order the
Lords appeared in, and that they were so posted
as that they could not be attackt but with great
Hazard, she had recourse to her old Subtilty of
treating with them, but they were not to be
taken twice in one Snare: They refused to treat
with her, and prepared to fight.—She sent
Messengers again, who pressed them to treat, to
prevent the Effusion of Blood; but they still de∣clined
it, and stood ready to engage, bidding
her fall on with her <HI>French</HI> Cut-throats when
she pleased, alledging, there was no Safety in
treating with her. However, at length they
consented to come to a Treaty on this Prelimi∣nary
first settled, that an Assurance should be
signed by the Duke of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that all the
<HI>French</HI> should be sent away over the <HI>Firth.</HI></P>
<P>This was done, and is called in <HI>Knox</HI>'s Histo∣ry
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Knox</HI>'s Hist. p. 155.</NOTE> the Assurance, and is signed by the
Duke of <HI>Chattelerault (Hamilton)</HI> and <HI>Dosell,</HI>
a <HI>French</HI> Lord. This Assurance was, That in 8
Days, Messengers should be sent by the Queen to
treat of a full Peace; but the Queen, who never
regarded her Engagements in such Cases, never
sent any Body to treat as she had promised, nor,
it seems, did she intend it; but thought that upon
this Treaty she should have an Opportunity to
convey her <HI>French</HI> Troops safe out of <HI>Fife,</HI> and
perhaps bring the Lords, in Confidence of her
Treaty, to disperse their Men: The first of these
she gain'd, but not the last.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="34"/>
The Lords waited some Time, but finding
no Body come, they, as Reason good, concluded
the Treaty broken.—And from this Time for∣ward
they depended no more upon the Faith
of Treaties, but upon their Arms: Many of the
principal Nobility came in to them every Day,
and instead of dispersing, they grew very strong;
and first they march'd to St. <HI>Johnston,</HI> to de∣liver
it from the Oppression of the Garrison
which the Queen Regent had placed there: The
Town was surrendered after some Difficulty,
and the Bishop's House at <HI>Scone</HI> rifled and burnt,
his Servants unadvisedly provoking the Multi∣tude,
whom the Lords had prevailed with to let
it alone.</P>
<P>From hence, fearing the Queen should inter∣cept
their advancing, which she was about to
do, by marching her self to <HI>Sterling,</HI> and putting
a Garrison into the Castle, they resolved to pre∣vent
her, and marching all Night, they took
Possession of <HI>Sterlings,</HI> and stopping there but
Three Days; in which the Churches were stript
of their Popish Ornaments, and the Abbey of
<HI>Cambuskenneth</HI> demolished, they marched on the
Fourth Day for <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen might, by this Time, have per∣ceived,
if her Eyes had been open, that the
whole Nation was bent upon the Reformation,
and that there was no resisting it; but God
had hardened her Heart, and she would not
understand what was visible to all the World;
for the People of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> hearing the Lords
of the <HI>Congregation</HI> were marching to them, did
all the Work to their Hands, and left no Rem∣nant
of Popery in any of the Churches, even
before the Lords got thither.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="35"/>
It was now the Year 1559, when the Lords
marched to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> in their Passage they
took <HI>Lithgo,</HI> and were joined by Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI>
who now came over to them, and wherever
they came, the Images, Altars, pictures, and
other Ensigns of Popery went to wreck.</P>
<P>I think 'tis a Piece of Justice to God's Provi∣dence,
which no one ought to pass over, that in
this Beginning of the Reformation, the Awe of
the Work was on the Hearts of the popish
Party; for had they made the least regular Op∣position,
the Congregation might at first have
been easily suppress'd.</P>
<P><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood</HI>'s Hist. lib. 111. fol. 126.</NOTE> Bishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> in his History tells us,
the Lords had but 300 Men in all their Com∣pany
when they marched from <HI>Sterling</HI> to <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
and the Queen had near 3000 <HI>French</HI> Sol∣diers,
besides the Popish Party, and their Ad∣herents,
who clave to her and yet at the first
News of their Approach, she fled to<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Buehan. lib. 16. fol. 170.—Scotorum &amp; Gallorum cohortes Mercenarias tantus terror invasit, ut cum omnibus quae trahere poterant impedimsntis Dunbarum perfugerent.</NOTE> to <HI>Dun∣bar</HI>
with all her Forces, and durst not look them
in the Face.</P>
<P>The Congregation being now Masters of the
capital City, and the Queen and her Foreign
Troops fled; they began to act in behalf of their
Country's Liberty, as well as in religious Mat∣ters;
This even by the Accounts which all
the Historians of that Time give of it, will
clear the first Reformers from the Slander that
is so diligently cast upon them of making a
<HI>tumultuary</HI> Reformation, or that it was only a
Rabble of the meaner Sort, who were for Plun∣der,
<PB N="33" REF="36"/>
and who, to enrich themselves with
Spoils of the Churches, ran into the Reforma∣tion
meerly to justifie their Robberies, and in∣demnifie
the Depredations they had made up∣on
the Church; for now they had not only
Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> at their Head, but a very great
Number of the Nobility and Gentry were
profest Managers of the Reformation, and the
common People having, except in their Ex∣cesses
about demolishing Idolatry, had little
Hand in it but as directed by their Superiors.</P>
<P>Another Thing worth noting here is, that
having now gotten Possession of <HI>Edinburgh, Octo∣ber</HI>
17. 1559. they appointed the reformed Mi∣nisters
to<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Scotorum proceres instaurandae religionis prin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ipes com∣plures in re ordinand<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Diei morati, praeter Aedium sacrarum a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> omni missificandi apparatu, repurgationem, verbo Dei sincere enun∣ciando, concionatores constituerunt—<HI>Ibid.</HI></NOTE> preach publickly in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>

but they saw an eminent Hand was with
them, and as the Scripture says of <HI>Jacob</HI> when
he journeyed from <HI>Succoth, the Fear of</HI> them <HI>fell
on all the Cities round about.</HI></P>
<P>Things standing in this Posture, (after Con∣sultation

does not note that there was yet any stated Coun∣cil
of the Nation establish'd on their Side<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hist. fol. 12.</NOTE>,
they sent several Messages to the Queen about the
settling Matters now in so much Disorder: The
Queen had published a Proclamation, wherein
she professed to be willing to refer Matters of
Religion to a free Parliament, to meet in <HI>Janu∣ary</HI>
next following, and gave Liberty of Preach∣ing,
<PB N="34" REF="37"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> till then:, but reproaches the Lords of
the Congregation with rejecting all<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> lib. 111. fol. 126.

Offers, shewing, that it is not Religion
they seek, but the Subversion of Authority, and
the Usurpation of the Crown. The Lords con∣front
this with Letters to the Queen, and by
open<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> lib. 3. fol. 126, 127. The Particulars of these Letters, Proclamations, and Declarations are set down.</NOTE> Proclamation to the people. In both they
call God to witness, that their only Intention is,
to banish Idolatry, advance the true Religion
and defend the Preachers thereof, promising to
continue in all Duty towards their Sovereign
and her Mother the Regent, provided they
might have these things secured to them, and
offered, in the mean Time, to give Assurance
of their Loyalty.</P>
<P>Several Messages and Returns pass'd between
them, and a Meeting was appointed of 100 of
a Side, to see, if possible, to accommodate
Matters: The chief on the Reformers Side were
the Earls of <HI>Argyle</HI> and <HI>Glencairn,</HI> Lord <HI>Ruth∣ven,</HI>
Lord <HI>Boyd,</HI> Lord <HI>James Hamilton,</HI> Lord <HI>O∣chiltry,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>These could come to no Conclusion, and
parted; and the Queen on her Part, prepared to
attack the Congregation: They kept together
in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and prepared to defend it: The
Duke of <HI>Chatellerault</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI>
laboured to compose Things, and at last a Truce
was agreed on, <HI>July</HI> 24, 1559.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="38"/>
By this Truce the Protestants; on one Hand,
were to be free in the Exercise of the reformed
Religion, and the Papists were likewise to be
unmolested; their religious, Houses not insulted,
nor their Tithes obstructed; the Congregation
was to quit <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but no Injury was to be
done the Citizens, nor any Garrison put upon
them; And all Things were to be referred to
a Parliament, to meet on the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>January</HI>
next.</P>
<P>Tho' the Queen Regent kept this Truce bet∣ter
than any before, yet it was not long; for a
Thousand <HI>French</HI> Foot arriving to her Assi∣stance,
she began her usual Deviations, first with
fortifying <HI>Leith</HI> for a Port, by which she might
secure her Supplies, and secondly, sending for
more Troops from <HI>France,</HI> by both which she
visibly prepared for War.</P>
<P>This occasioned that famous Meeting at <HI>Ha∣milton,</HI>
where the Lords of the Congregation
agreed to write a common Letter to the Queen
Regent, which was dated <HI>September</HI> 29, 1559<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> lib. 3 fol. 131. The Contents of the Letter.</NOTE>,
and subscribed by the Duke of <HI>Chattellerault,</HI> the
Earls of <HI>Arran, Argyle, Glencairn,</HI> and <HI>Monteth,</HI>
and abundance of Lords and Gentlemen.</P>
<P>The Congregation were so alarm'd at the
fortifying of <HI>Leith,</HI> and the <HI>French</HI> Troops the
Queen had fixed there, for she had now 2000
Foot more arrived, with Money, Arms, and Am∣munition;
that they gave Notice, by Letters, into
all Parts of the Kingdom; and long Messages,
Proclamations<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> 132, 133. See there the Queen's Proclamation, the Lords Declaration, the Lords Letter to the Queen at <HI>Leith,</HI> the Queen;s Message by <HI>Lyon,</HI> King at Arms, to the Lords, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>, Charges, and Recriminations
<PB N="36" REF="39"/>
past between the Queen Regent and them, in
which they insisted upon the dismissing the Fo∣reign
Troops, and demolishing <HI>Leith;</HI> but all to
no Purpose.</P>
<P>Upon this the Lords arm'd again, and ad∣vanc'd
to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> The Queen retreats to her
new Fortifications at <HI>Leith,</HI> and with her <HI>French</HI>
Forces and Friends, to the Number of 6000,
shutting her self up there, sends Messages to the
Duke and the Lords, by the Herald at Arms,
charging them with Rebellion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords convened a great Assembly, little
less than a general Convention, wherein the
Lord <HI>Ruthven</HI> was President; and having there
considered how they had made all the peaceable
Applications to the Queen Regent for their Li∣berties,
both Civil and Religious; for the dis∣missing
Strangers, and demolishing the Fortifi∣cations
raised there, and having not been able to
obtain Redress by Reason of the Obstinacy of
the Regent, they began to deliberate how, re∣serving
their Loyalty and Obedience to their
Sovereign, and her lawful Authority, they might
yet depose the exorbitant Power of the Queen
Regent, or at least restrain it, as being exerci∣sed
in Breach of the Laws, and injurious to the
Authority and Royal Dignity of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>It was a bold Offer at that Time of Day,
and startled the Assembly at first; some were
for it, some against it, and they resolved to
ask the Opinion of the Ministers about it. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
have not Room here to insert the Messages, De∣clarations,
Proclamations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are to be
found at large, as noted below<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> lib. 3. fol. 136, 137.
<HI>Knox</HI>'s Hist. lib. 2. fol. 202.</NOTE>; for <HI>Bucha∣nan</HI>
<PB N="37" REF="40"/>
meddles not with them. But the Ministers
Opinion I cannot omit.</P>
<P>The Ministers, who were called, were Two,
Mr. <HI>John Willock</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Knox,</HI> whose O∣pinions
are faithfully enough related by Mr.
<HI>Spotswood,</HI> and agree with the Account in <HI>Knox</HI>'s
History, and areas follows.</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Willock <HI>first gave his Opinion,</HI> “That,
albeit Magistracy be God's Ordinance, and
that they who bear Rule, have their Authority
from him, yet their Power is not so largely ex∣tended
but that the same is bounded and limit∣ed
by God in his Word: And albeit God had
appointed Magistrates his Lieutenants on Earth,
honouring them with his own Title, calling
them Gods; yet did he never so establish any,
but for just Causes they might be deprived:
For even as Subjects, <HI>said he,</HI> are commanded
to obey their Magistrates; so Magistrates have
Directions given them for their Behaviour to∣wards
those they rule; and God, in his Word,
hath defined the Duty both of one and the
other. In deposing Princes, and those that
have born Authority, God did not always use
his immediate Power, but sometimes he used
other Means, such as in his Wisdom he thought
good; as by <HI>Asa,</HI> he removed <HI>Maacha,</HI> his own
Mother; by <HI>Jehu,</HI> he destroyed <HI>Joram;</HI> and by
divers others he deposed from the Govern∣ment
those whom he had established before
by his own Word. From which, <HI>he inferred,</HI>
That since the Queen Regent had denied her
chief Duty to the Subjects of the Realm, which
was to minister Justice indifferently, to pre∣serve
them from the Invasion of Strangers,
and to suffer the Word of God to be freely
preached; seeing also she was a Maintainer of
<PB N="38" REF="41"/>
Superstition, and despised the Counsel of the
Nobility, he did think, they might justly deprive
her from all Regiment and Authority over
them.”</P>
<P><HI>Mr.</HI> Knox <HI>coming to speak after approved all
that his Brother had said, adding this more,</HI> “That
the Iniquity of the Queen Regent ought, no
to withdraw their Hearts from the Obedi∣ence
due to their Sovereign; nor did he wish
any such Sentence to be pronounced against
her, but that when she should change her
Course, and submit her self to good Council,
there mould be Place left to her of Regress
to the same Honours from which, for just
Causes, she ought now to be deprived.”</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Spotswood</HI> is very angry<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotfwood,</HI> lib. 3 fo. 137 It had been a better and a wiser Part in these Preachers, to have excused themselves from giving any Opinion in these Matters; for they might be sure to have it cast in their Teeth, to the Scandal of their Profession—</NOTE> with the Mi∣nisters
for Two Things here, in which, tho'
he is a good Historian, he shews himself of a
Party against them in behalf of the Doctrine of
Passive Obedience, a Thing not much talk'd of
in those Days.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> He says, the Ministers should have re∣fused
to have meddled in this Matter, or to
have given their Opinion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> he says, the Examples they brought
were not to the Case; and then he subjoins his
own Opinion, in which he takes upon him to
condemn the Practice of Nations in deposing Ty∣rants
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> Hist. fol. 137. lib. 3. Neither was the Opinion, they gave, sound in it self, nor had it any Warrant in the Word of God: For howbeit, the Power of the Magistrates be limited and their Office prescribed by, God, and that they may likewise full into great Offences: Yet it is no where permitted to Subjects to call their Princes in Question, or to make Insurrections against them, God having reserved the Punishment of Princes <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Himself. [It were to be wish'd the Author had proved this last Affirmation.]</NOTE>, and rescuing themselves by Force
<PB N="39" REF="42"/>
from Bondage and Slavery, when all other
Means have been found to no purpose, <HI>which was
exactly the Case here.</HI> But we all know when
this good old Man wrote; I mean, in an Age
when these Nations lull'd asleep by the wheed∣ling
Arts of Tyranny, under the gay-painted
Visor of Loyalty and Subjection, became Agents
to their own Bondage,—But they have grown
wiser since, which, if Mr. <HI>Spotswood</HI> had lived to
see, I dare say he had so much good Sense and
good Meaning in him, he must have altered his
Opinion.</P>
<P>As to his first Objection—which strikes at the
Discretion of the Ministers only, and charges
their▪ Prudentials, it may be briefly answered,
that their Case differed: This was a Case begun
in, and carried on for, the Matters of Religion:
The Nobility and the Ministers had all along
gone on Hand in Hand, aiding, assisting, and ad∣vising
one another, and it would have been ve∣ry
unkind if the Ministers, in a Case of Consci∣ence
too, should have declined their Opinion
to those Gentlemen who, at that Time, by their
Instigation very much, <HI>at least with their full
Concurrence,</HI> had ventured their Lives, Families,
and Estates in the publick Affair of religious
Liberty; it had been abandoning their Friends,
and which is worse, their Cause too.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="43"/>
Nor was this all, but the Case required it;
for if it was <HI>against their Opinions</HI> that Authority
might be resisted in Cases of Invasion of Right,
<HI>what did they there?</HI> And if it <HI>was their Opini∣on,</HI>
Silence had only signified that it was their
Judgment, but that they <HI>feared the chief Priests,</HI>
John xii. 42. <HI>that is,</HI> were Cowards, and durst
not own their Principles.</P>
<P>Again, it was a general Convention of the
Estates of <HI>Scotland,</HI> that on such an Emergen∣cy,
demanded their Opinion and this was to
them the <HI>lawful Authority</HI> at that Time, and
they ought not to have disobeyed them in any
lawful Thing, if they esteem'd them a lawful
<HI>Authority.</HI></P>
<P>His Doctrine about deposing Rulers is on so
many Occasions answered, both in Print, as also in
the Practice of Nations, that I shall not take up
any of these Sheets in it. But this I thought ne∣cessary
to say in Defence of the Ministes of the
first Reformation, I hope none of the Clergy
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> will blame them, seeing
they owe now the Settlement and Deliverance
of their own Church from Popish Invasions to
the same deposing Doctrine at the Revoluti∣on.</P>
<P><HI>But to return to the Story:</HI> The Assembly, or

after the Ministers had given their Opinion, u∣nanimously
voted the Regent out of her Office,
renounced their Obedience to her, and bid her
and her <HI>Frenchmen</HI> depart.</P>
<P>They exhibited to her a long Charge, where∣in
they did not spare her; but setting out her
false and treacherous Dealings with them, they

concluded thus<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Buchan. lib. 16. fol. 172.

<P>I have been the longer upon this Part of the
Story, <HI>and shall atone for it in my Brevity in o∣ther
Cases;</HI> because as the Reason of these Me∣moirs
is to set the Matter of the past and pre∣sent
State of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in a true
Light, cleared from those Mists and Darkness
which the partial Glosses of some late Pa∣trons
of Tyranny have spread over her Histo∣ry;
so these being some of the most capital
Parts of her Progression to the present happy
Settlement which we see her now in, it is
essential to my Work to leave this Part as clear
and explicit as I can.</P>
<P>And it may be particularly pleasant to the
Friends of her Establishment, to observe how
wonderfully divine Providence has wrought for
her, not barely in rescuing her by Violence out
of the Jaws of Superstition, and its Handmaid
Tyranny; but the same Providence has given a
Sanction to the very Method, by obliging those
very People, who upbraid her with the Man∣ner
of her Establishment, as being popular and
tumultuary, and built on the Foundation of Re∣bellion,
against lawful Authority, to be behold∣ing
<PB N="42" REF="45"/>
to the very same lawful Means for the E∣stablishment
they now are built upon.</P>
<P>Nor is there any Case that I meet with so
parallel to the late Revolution in <HI>England</HI> as
this Revolution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet we are not
of the Opinion that the Revolution in <HI>England</HI>
was tumultuary at all.</P>
<P>They both began, and both were carried on
by the same Methods, and no other, by which
Nations oppressed, have, in all Ages, recover∣ed
their Liberty, and snatched themselves out
of the Jaws of Tyranny and Oppression: Ways
honourable, and justifiable by the Laws of God,
of Nature, and of Nations.</P>
<P>I shall keep my Word, as to Brevity, in the
following Part of the Story.—The Nobility
having thus renounced the Regent, they sent to
summon the Town of <HI>Leith;</HI> but the <HI>French</HI>
had made it too strong to part with it so easily.</P>
<P>They were indeed formidable to the Con∣gregation;
for they had the Command of the
Sea, and being at least 8000 Men well officer'd
and disciplin'd, they transported themselves o∣ver
into <HI>Fife,</HI> and ravaged the Country from
<HI>Sterling</HI> Bridge to St. <HI>Andrews.</HI></P>
<P>The Congregation had no proportioned Forces
for this Work, nor wherewith to supply them:
They sent to <HI>England</HI> and borrow'd 4000 Crowns
for present Occasion; but the Queen, who had
her Spies upon them, got Intelligence of it, and
surpriz'd both the Man and the Money.</P>
<P>Their Affairs thus running backward, they
came to the last and only Expedient, which was
to put themselves under the Protection of the
Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and seek Assistance.—And
here it is to be noted, that the Presbyterians did
not fly to Foreign Help to invade their Sove∣reign,
<PB N="43" REF="46"/>
as some will have it to be; the Establishing
the Reformation did not seek Foreign Help; for
the Nation having so universally embrac'd the
Protestant Religion, there was not one in Ten
to stand against them.</P>
<P>But the Case turned just the other Way: The
Lords of the Congregation had, as has been re∣lated,
engaged in the Reformation; the Queen
Regent had, by several Treaties, assented to it,
Part, at one Time, Part at another, but keep∣ing
no Faith with them, and resolving, if pos∣sible,
to root them out—she <HI>flies to Foreign Aid:</HI>
Mark it; she brings in an Army of Strangers,
takes Possession of their Towns, and fortifies'em,
in Order to support her in the tyrannical Mea∣sures
she had taken.</P>
<P>To root out this Mischief the War began, and
not meerly for Religion; had the Nation been
clear'd of Foreigners, on either Side, the Work
had soon been done; but being invaded by
<HI>France,</HI> they flew to <HI>England</HI> for Help, and
soon obtained it.</P>
<P>The Queen of <HI>England,</HI> upon a Treaty sign'd
in her Name by the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> and in
Name of the Duke of <HI>Chattellerault</HI> by Commis∣sion
appointed, sent the Lord <HI>Gray</HI> with 2000
Horse, and 6000 Foot, and after that a Reinforce∣ment
of 2000 Foot more.</P>
<P>By these, after a long Siege, and an obstinate
Resistance, the Town was at last surrendered,
and the <HI>French</HI> Soldiers, by Capitulation, con∣veyed
home to <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>During these Things, the Queen Regent had
retired to the Castle of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where she
fell sick, and soon after dyed. Some say, she
broke her Heart for Grief that she was thus
reduced. Bishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> says, That she sent
<PB N="44" REF="47"/>
for the Duke and the confederate Lords, before
she died, and exhorted them to end this War,
and send home both <HI>French</HI> and <HI>English:</HI> That
she ask'd Pardon of all she had injured, and dy∣ed
very<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood,</HI> lib. 3. fol. 146. She sent for <HI>John Willock,</HI> the Preacher, (<HI>Bishop</HI> Spotswood <HI>would not call him Minister</HI>) and conferring with him a reasonable Space, declared openly that she trusted to be saved only by the Death and Merits of Jesus Christ, and thus ended her Life most christianly.</NOTE> christianly. But he quotes no Au∣thority
for it, neither do any other Historians,
that I have met with, say any such Thing.</P>
<P>Her Death finished this first War, <HI>as I may
call it,</HI> and hastened the Surrender of <HI>Leith,</HI>
which held out but a little while; not but that
it might have held longer, and no doubt it
would, the Garrison being resolute, well pro∣vided,
and Relief expected; but the Queen of
<HI>England</HI> and the King of <HI>France</HI> having brought
Matters to a Treaty abroad, a Treaty at home
followed of course; so Ambassadors, from either,
met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and a Truce being at first a∣greed
on, the Capitulation and general Peace
followed; and the <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1560, the <HI>English</HI>
Army marched for <HI>Barwick,</HI> the <HI>French</HI> set sail
for <HI>France,</HI> and a general Peace was made; in
which, among other Articles, this glorious Sti∣pulation
was one, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>the REFORMA∣TION
WAS ACKNOWLEDG'D,</HI> and con∣sidering
the Infancy of the Church, and the
Difficulties her first Champions had waded
through, it was a very great Step to her fu∣ture
Establishment.</P>
<P>The Death of the Queen Mother was follow∣ed
by another Event, which had no less In∣fluence
upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and this
<PB N="45" REF="48"/>
was, That the Queen became a Widow, <HI>Fran∣cis</HI>
II, the King of <HI>France,</HI> dying the same Year,
a few Months after his Mother-in-Law.</P>
<P>This gave a new Turn to the Affairs of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
and the Popish Party was, and not with∣out
Cause, exceedingly surprized at it; for they
had before, the whole Kingdom of <HI>France</HI> con∣cern'd
to support them; and their Queen being
then married to the King of <HI>France</HI> they had
them jointly concerned in the Affairs; whereas
now, another King succeeding to the Crown of
<HI>France,</HI> their Queen became but a Dowager, an
Allie, and her Interest and Power would be the
less to support her Friends in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Congregation had now the Government
of the whole Kingdom in their Hands, and the
Queen was, as we may say, at their Mercy:
And this was a special Providence to them, as
for settling the Reformation, so to clear up the
Reputation of the Reformers, and purge them
from the Charge the late Queen Regent had laid
upon them, of aiming at the Subversion of the
Government, and dethroning their Sovereign,
to set up either Lord <HI>James,</HI> or the Duke of
<HI>Chattellerault</HI> in her Place.</P>
<P>But this still tended to their Reputation, and
to exonerate them as to the Charge for when
the Regent was dead, the Queen a desolate Wi∣dow,
and they had all the power in their Hands,
their upright Design could never better appear;
for they had no one to hinder their Project,
if they had had it in their View; but being
sincerely bent for the Reformation of Religion,
and the Establishment of their Civil Liberties,
and aiming at nothing else, they applyed them∣selves
wholly to that Work, and no other, as
will appear in the Pursuit of this Story.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="49"/>
In order to this, having dismiss'd the <HI>English</HI>
Army, and shipp'd off the <HI>French,</HI> the first
Thing that was done was, That in the great
Church at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Lords of the Congre∣gation,
and all the Gentlemen, their Adherents,
who were there, met to give solemn Thanks
to God for their Deliverance from the Tyran∣ny
of Foreigners and establishing the true Re∣ligion,
and their Civil Liberties.</P>
<P>Then says, Bishop <HI>Spotswood</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 3. fol.</HI> 149.</NOTE> <HI>Then were the Ministers,
by common Advice, distributed among the</HI> Burghs; John Knox
<HI>for</HI> Edinburgh, Christopher Goodman <HI>for St.</HI> Andrews, A∣dam
Herriot <HI>at</HI> Aberdeen, <HI>&amp;c. Besides these they did nomi∣nate</HI>
(but he does not say who) <HI>for the Direction of Church
Affairs: Some to be Superintendents,</HI> viz. <HI>Mr.</HI> John Spotswood
<HI>for</HI> Louthian <HI>and</HI> Mers, <HI>Mr,</HI> John Winram <HI>for</HI> Fife, John
Areskine <HI>of</HI> Dun <HI>for</HI> Angus <HI>and</HI> Mearns, <HI>Mr.</HI> John Willock
<HI>for</HI> Glasgow, <HI>and Mr.</HI> John Kerswell <HI>for</HI> Argyle <HI>and</HI> Iles.
<HI>With this small Number of Bishops</HI> (he would have called
them) <HI>was the Plantation of the Church at first undertaken.,</HI> for I must
be particular here as to Authors, they distribu∣ted
Ministers among the Burghs, and appoint∣ed
Superintendents for the Direction of the
Church Affairs.</P>
<P>I note this the rather here, because some.
Gentlemen, who are angry with the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> for the present Establishment, would
call this Superintendency an Infant Prelacy; and
from thence argue, that the first Reformation
was Episcopal, which Difficulty we shall see
clear'd up as we go on.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, it will receive its full Answer
in these Two Observations.</P>
<P>1. They had no Power: What they were to do, or
what Power they had for the planting or displacing
Ministers in the Kingdom, had these two Things
<PB N="47" REF="50"/>
<HI>attending it, which quite enervates the Bishop's Al∣legation,</HI>
viz.</P>
<P>(1.) That it was all subservient to the Assembly
of Ministers; nay, these <HI>Superintendents</HI> were sub∣jected
to the respective Presbyteries: They might be
displac'd by them, <HI>and</HI> supply'd by them; <HI>and</HI> the
Assembly does <HI>still,</HI> on extraordinary Occasions, depute
or commission Ministers, <HI>in like manner,</HI> for the
planting or displacing their Ministers, visiting of
Churches, and the like.</P>
<P>(2.) They had neither Superiority of <HI>Dignity,</HI> or
Enlargement of <HI>Stipend,</HI> or any other Thing
which might invade that PARITY which is
orofess'd by the Presbyterian Church.</P>
<P>2. The Case was extraordinary, and it is what
is never practised in the Church but on extraordi∣nary
Occasions, of which this is allowed to be one;
and there is no Question but on the like extraordina∣ry
Occasions, the like Offices would be made use of
again, which, in short, were only Delegations, or Substi∣tutions
by and from the General Assembly: The Men
had neither personal Dignity, nor personal Power;
their Commission was temporary, and the Limitation
of their Authority was such, as whenever the Bishops
of the Church of <HI>England</HI> please to reduce them∣selves
to, there is no Presbyterian Church in the
World but would receive them.</P>
<P>The Debate therefore of this supposed Episcopacy
must fall to the Ground, unless the Gentlemen that
are for it, are content to subject Episcopacy to
Presbytery; for the Assembly of Ministers, either
General, Synodical, or Presbyterial had a Power
over those Superintendents, and the Remark would be
very well worth Note what a Kind of a Bishop it
is these Gentlemen plead for.</P>
<P>The Superintendents were, in short, a temporary
Expedient for the Necessity of the first planting the
<PB N="48" REF="51"/>
Church, and the Ministers, who appointed them,
were the most antiepiscopal in Principle that could
be found, as we shall see presently. <HI>But I return to
the Story.</HI></P>
<P>The Lords having thus settled the Church's
Affairs for the present, all Things rested till
the Meeting of a Convention, or Parliament,
which was appointed to be in <HI>August</HI> following.</P>
<P>Here another Dispute happened, which the
Popish Party have still insisted on, <HI>viz. How
this could be called a Parliament, since it was not
called by the Queen,</HI> neither <HI>had her Majesty any
Body there commissioned to represent her Person.</HI></P>
<P>But the Treaty of Peace solv'd this; which
being stipulated in the Name and by the Am∣bassador
of the King and Queen, authorised the
Council of Twelve, to call a Convention or
Parliament, and this fully legitimated it, tho'
there was no Person to represent the Sovereign.</P>
<P>In this Parliament all that had been done be∣fore
was ratified; and having a sufficient War∣rant,
as before, for the holding this Parliament,
they esteemed what Acts pass'd, Authentick,
tho' the Queen afterwards refused to ratifie
them, <HI>as we shall hear presently.</HI></P>
<P>Four Acts pass'd in this Parliament, tho' they
had not the Royal Assent till several Years af∣terward.</P>
<P>1. The Confession of Faith. Note, it pass'd
in Parliament <HI>August</HI> 17, 1560.</P>
<P>2. An Act for abolishing the Jurisdiction and
Authority of the Bishops.</P>
<P>3. Repealing, or annulling all former Acts
made for the maintaining of Idolatry.</P>
<P>4. For punishing the Sayers and Hearers of
Mass.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="52"/>
A Messenger was sent over to the Queen with
these Acts, to desire her Majesty to sign them;
but the Queen would not so much as give an
Answer to him, but treated him with the ut∣most
Contempt. However, the Acts being past,
the Assembly was dissolved, and this was the
first Settlement of the Reformation.</P>
<P>It is to be observed here, that the Articles of
the Confession of Faith, contain all the <HI>doctrinal
Part</HI> of the Reformer's profession; but have
not one Word of the <HI>Discipline</HI> or <HI>Government</HI>
of the Church; nor was the Form of Worship
settled here: And to this it is needful to say
something; because great Pains are taken here
to make the first Reformation look as if it had
been <HI>Episcopal.</HI></P>
<P>That they had a Form of Discipline and
Worship before this, is<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood</HI>'s History, fol. 14. Before the Confession of Faith was formed, and the Book of Discipline contrived, the re∣formed Kirk had that Book which is before the Psalms in Meeter for their Direction in Discipline and external Worship; which Book is called in the Book of Diseipline, the Book of Common Order, or the Order of the Church at <HI>Geneva.</HI></NOTE> allowed by all Hi∣storians,
which was the Order of <HI>Geneva;</HI> the new
one <HI>Spotswood</HI> calls the Form of<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 3. fol. 152. In the Couvention kept at</HI> Edinburgh <HI>in</HI> January <HI>preceding,</HI> a Form of Church Po∣licy <HI>was presented, and delivered to be ratified.</HI></NOTE> Church Policy.</P>
<P>It is necessary to digress a little here to the
Story of Mr. <HI>John Knox.</HI> He had been long
at <HI>Geneva,</HI> and was Minister of the <HI>English</HI> Church
there: He had also been at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> where the
<HI>English,</HI> who fled from Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Persecu∣tion,
had a Church, and Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> preaching
there, a Difference arose about the <HI>English</HI> Ser∣vice-Book,
which drove him back to <HI>Geneva.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="53"/>
Here he drew the Model of Church Govern∣ment,
which he after presented to the Refor∣mers
in <HI>Scotland</HI> for the Scheme of theirs; and
by this was that Book of Polity or Discipline
formed which we are now to treat of. Some
Historians have called it <HI>John Knox</HI>'s Work:
Others say, it was done by a<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Commission was given to Mr.</HI> John Winram, John Spots∣wood, <HI>the Bishop's Father,</HI> John Willock, John Douglas, John Rew, <HI>and</HI> John Knox, <HI>to draw up a Book of Policy and Discipline of the Church, as they had done of the Doctrine.</HI></NOTE> Committee.</P>
<P>They that would call it <HI>John Knox</HI>'s, strive to
do it because the Article of Superintendents
being mentioned in this Book of Discipline, they
would have <HI>John Knox</HI> be acknowledged to be
of Episcopal Principles.</P>
<P>But I conceive, that all this Dispute about
the Superintendents would be at an End, if it
were examined, whether these Superintendents
were not really Bishops? And whether the true
Episcopacy is not plainly to be reduced to the
ministerial Function? So that this is so far from
justifying the Authority, Dignity, and Superi∣ority
of Bishops, as now practised, that it ra∣ther
brings down the Bishop, to the Station of
those Superintendents, the utmost of whose Au∣thority
is by Dr. <HI>Rule</HI> plainly proved to be ve∣ry
consistent with <HI>Presbyterian Parity,</HI> a Thing
which, if well<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib.</HI> III. <HI>fol. 174. It had been fram'd by</HI> John Knox, <HI>partly in Imitation of the reformed Churches in</HI> Germany, <HI>and partly of that he had seen at</HI> Geneva.</NOTE> considered, would soon put
an End to this Debate.</P>
<P>This Book of Discipline, however, could not
obtain, with the Lords, to a general Assent, whe∣ther
Mr. <HI>Knox</HI> formed it or not; 'tis plain he
<PB N="51" REF="54"/>
exceedingly press'd to have it pass'd in the Con∣vention.
Bishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> says, the Estates at
that Time did not think it meet to enter into
the Examination of the <HI>Polity.</HI> By this he
would insinuate, that the Reformation was set∣tled
in general, as to Doctrine, and that all a∣greed
in the Suppression of Popery; but that
the Manner, Order, Polity, or Discipline of the
Church was left uncertain and undetermined.
But neither will this answer: For tho' as an As∣sembly
or Convention they did not sign it, yet
as private Men, the whole Body of the first Re∣formers,
who had been called <HI>The Congregation,</HI>
and who had done all the Work, <HI>signed it</HI>—
These were the Duke of <HI>Chatellerault,</HI> the Earls of
<HI>Arran, Argyle, Glencairn, Marshall, Monteith,
Morton,</HI> and <HI>Rothes;</HI> Lords, James <HI>Hamilton, Ye∣ster,
Boyd, Ochiltrie, Sanquhar, Lindsay:</HI> And A∣bundance
of the Gentry, Barons, and Burgesses,
with one Bishop, <HI>viz.</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> and the Dean
of <HI>Murray.</HI></P>
<P>But to go on with our History.</P>
<P>Thus far the Convention had acted in behalf
of the Church: (1.) They pull'd down, and by
an Act, abolished Popery for ever. (2.) They
declared the Confession of the Protestant Faith,
and pass'd the Articles of it into an Act: And
thus they set the Church upon her own Legs,
and then left her to settle and fix her self upon
such Foundations of Discipline and Government
as she should determine.</P>
<P>In order to this, the first General Assembly
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> sat down at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>December,</HI> 1560.</P>
<P>Their chief Work was appointing and re∣ceiving
Ministers, and that alone determined, that
the very Office of Superintendent was subjected
<PB N="52" REF="55"/>
to the Assembly; but if that did not, we shall
see in a few Years they take upon them to li∣mit,
approve, and disapprove their Actions.</P>
<P>Even in this first Assembly, the other Party
made some Struggle about the Authority of as∣sembling
without the Queen's Command, and
as this has been a Point frequently push'd at
since, and once not very long ago, and may, in
Time, come to be push'd at again, it cannot be
amiss to set down the Argument then used,
which, in short, was this principally.</P>
<P>They had then a Popish Queen, who, unwilling∣ly,
stoop'd to Necessity in the Reformation, their
Words are these, <HI>viz.</HI> if the Liberty of the Kirk should
depend upon the Allowance and Disallowance of the
Sovereign, <HI>we may be deprived, not only of</HI> Assem∣blies,
<HI>but of the publick Preaching of the Gospel. Take
from the Church the Freedom of Assemblies, and
you take from us the Reformation; for how shall
the Government of the Church be supported, Order
and Unity in Doctrine be maintained, but by the
Liberty of holding</HI> Assemblies, <HI>and keeping up the
judicial Authority of the Church entire.</HI> This
way of Arguing was never yet answered, and,
I presume, will not easily be answered.</P>
<P>It was then moved, in the Assembly, that the
Queen might be desired to ratifie the Book of
Discipline, but it was deferred for that Time.</P>
<P>The Queen was now returned to <HI>Scotland, an.</HI>
1561, and began to take Cognizance of her
Affairs, in which she very early discovered her
Dislike of what was doing, and her general
Aversion to the Reformation.</P>
<P>It seem'd, however, that the Queen, enclined
to stoop to the Necessity of the Times, and to ac∣quiesce
in the new Church Settlement, with al∣lowing
her the Liberty of her own Opinion,
<PB N="53" REF="56"/>
and to have Mass said in private in her own
Chappel—but this gave great Offence, and the
Ministers particularly insisted upon it, that it
was against their Engagements for the abolish∣ing
Idolatry, and, inculcating this on the Peo∣ple,
the Queen found she lost very much of
their Affection by it, and not only so, but met
with some Affronts in it also. However, re∣solved
to support, not only her Authority, but
her Party, she proceeded warmly.</P>
<P>She put the Provost of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> into the Ca∣stle,
and obliged the Citizens to choose another.
This was done for their forbidding the Popish
Priests to be received into the Town. She then
commanded the Town-Council of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to
choose a new Provost, which they, for Fear,
at that Time complied with. Next by Procla∣mation,
she made the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> free, as
she term'd it, for all her Subjects to repair to on
their lawful Occasions. This restor'd the Papists:
And here she not only had the better of the City,
but really seemed to have some Right on her
Side, and therefore the Lords did not stand by
the Citizens in it as was expected.</P>
<P>Indeed the Court being now formed, and the
Queen acting with great Candour in other
Things, the Nobility began to be drawn in by
Offices, Sallaries, and Preferments; together
with the Emulation and Ambition, usual in such
Cases; so that the Lords, who were before, the
most zealous for the Reformation, tho' they re∣tained
their sincere Profession of the Protestant
Religion, yet they remitted much of their for∣mer
Zeal, and seemed to be drawn off from
their Strictness in the Prosecution of, and their
warm Application to the great Work of all. And
<PB N="54" REF="57"/>
this our Historians, of both Parties<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 4. fol.</HI> 183. Some of the Noblemen who had, in former Times, shewed themselves most zealous against the Toleration of Idolatry, were grown a little more cold by the Flat∣teries of the Court; and all of them emulous of each other's Greatness, were striving who should be in most Favour with the Queen.</NOTE>,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol. 34. The Courtiers and Lords de∣pending upon the Court, came not to the Assembly; but the Day following, to avoid Suspicion, they came:</HI> These he names, <HI>viz. The Duke, the Earls of</HI> Argyle, Murray, Glencairn, Morton, Rothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The very Authors and Beginners of the Congregation:</NOTE> very
much complain of, as if they had abandoned
the Reformation: However, they soon gave good
Evidence to the contrary.</P>
<P>Little pass'd now for some Time in the Affairs
of the Reformation, the Assembly had their con∣stant
Dyets, and peaceably proceeded in Church-Affairs,
as Matters presented: The Queen
suffered them to go on, but at the same Time
she shewed, on all Occasions, that she secretly
resolved to cut them short, as Opportunity
should present.</P>
<P>In this interval one Thing happened which
might have shewn her, that the Protestants, their
Religion being but secured to them, were very
loyal to her Person, and to her Government
also; for in the Insurrection, which about that
Time was raised by <HI>Huntley</HI> and the <HI>Gordons,</HI>
she saw the Papists in Arms against her, and
the Lord <HI>James Stuart,</HI> who was now Earl of
<HI>Murray,</HI> and was the most zealous Reformer,
fighting for her with a Band of Protestants at
the Battle at <HI>Corriche,</HI> where <HI>Huntley</HI> was rout∣ed,
and kill'd, and all his popish Party scat∣tered.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="58"/>
The long Accounts now intervene in our Hi∣stories
of the Queen's proposed Interview with
the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and how the Papists dis∣appointed
it, from the very same Principles
which they did the Interview of King <HI>James</HI> V,
and <HI>Henry</HI> VIII, of <HI>England</HI> long before. Also
the History of the Queen's Amours with the
Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> and that wretched Marriage from
whence so many Mischiefs ensued; how the Ex∣orbitance
of <HI>David Rizzio</HI> brought not only his
own Ruin upon his Head, but the exasperated
King running into the unhappy Excess of Jea∣lousie
and Murther, so alienated the Queen from
him, as to run her into the same Extreams of
Murther and Revenge: And this upon the ve∣ry
Person of her Husband: These are sad Sto∣ries,
and as they have no Concern in this Work,
so I am not delighting enough in such tragical
Relations, as to make a Digression here to intro∣duce
them, neither do they relate at all to the
Affairs of the Church. To which I return.</P>
<P>Soon after the Defeat of the <HI>Gordons,</HI> the
Queen calls a Parliament; when she made so
many Concessions to the Protestants that some
blind sort of People began to fancy the Queen
would come over to the reformed Religion:
But she soon undeceived them.</P>
<P>For the Match between the Queen and the
Lord <HI>Darnly</HI> now coming forward, the Prote∣stant
Nobility took Umbrage at the Conse∣quences,
the Lord <HI>Darnley professing himself Popish.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen summon'd the Estates of the King∣dom
to <HI>Sterling,</HI> to give their A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent to her
Marriage.</P>
<P>There was little Opposition made in that Parli∣ament,
either to that or any Thing else; the
Nobility, in Complaisance to the Queen, com∣plying
<PB N="56" REF="59"/>
Plying more readily than was expected, only
one<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 4. fol. 189. Lord</HI> Ochiltry <HI>only opposed it openly, prosessing that he would never consent to admit a King of the Papish Religion.</HI>

themselves so much exalted, and behaved
with so little Caution in their Hopes, that it
occasioned great Jealousie among the Nobility,
and was partly the Occasion of what followed;
for no sooner was this Assent of the Estates to the
Marriage made publick, but the People fell into a
Rage, saying, that the Lords of the Estates had
broke in upon their Engagements, and would over∣throw
the Reformation: Several Tumults also
happened, particularly in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which the
Queen prosecuted with great Severity.</P>
<P>But now the Lords, of whom I noted before
that they were suspected to be yielding too
much to the Court, began to open their Eyes
and come to themselves, joining themselves to∣gether
to oppose this Marriage, and to main∣tain
the Reformation.</P>
<P>The General Assembly of the Church was
sitting at the same Time, and as all People be∣gan
to entertain Jealousies of the Queen's De∣signs,
and strong Apprehensions filled the Heads
of those that were most concern'd for Religion,
seeing the Queen resolved to support Popery,
and that she was now going to strengthen that
Interest with a Popish Match: So they for∣med
a Petition to her Majesty, containing Eight
Heads. The <HI>2d</HI> Article, of which was, That
<PB N="57" REF="60"/>
the Protestant Religion should be openly pro∣fessed
by all Persons, and by the Queen her self.
The Queen's Answer, very sharp and satyri∣cal,
is, with the Articles of the Petition, set
down at large in <HI>Spotswood</HI>'s<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spotswood'<HI>s History, lib. 4. fol.</HI> 190, 191.</NOTE> History, where∣in
she rejects their Petition, and tells them plainly
she will not change her Religion, nor put the
Patronage of Benefices out of her Hands.</P>
<P>Tho' they could expect no other Answer, yet
this inflamed Matters, and serv'd to six the
Confederation, and restore the Zeal of the No∣bility,
who had now begun to oppose her, and
in which she afterwards found her Ruine.</P>
<P>The Match was now fix'd, and the Queen
married to the Lord <HI>Darnley,</HI> in <HI>July</HI> 1564, dis∣regarding
the Representation of the discontent∣ed
Lords, who openly profess'd it to be against
the Liberties of the Kingdom, and began to
arm.</P>
<P>The Queen prepar'd to oppose them, and
march'd towards <HI>Sterling,</HI> and the King with
her; but the Lords, not prepared for Resistance,
fled to <HI>Paisly,</HI> near <HI>Glasgow;</HI> from thence, be∣ing
followed by the Queen's Forces, they fled
to <HI>Hamilton,</HI> thence to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> then separated,
some fled to <HI>England,</HI> and some reconciled them∣selves
to the Queen: Thus the first Beginnings
of this Fire were quenched for a while, and the
People quieted, who nevertheless were zealous
in the Cause, tho' discouraged by these unhappy
Beginnings. The Nobility being thus disper∣sed
for some Time, the Protestant Cause seem'd
to lie bleeding. The Lords, who fled to <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
obtained the Queen of <HI>England</HI> to inter∣ceed
<PB N="58" REF="61"/>
for them by her Ambassador; but she was,
as it were,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Spot▪ <HI>fol. 192. The Messenger had his answer in Writing,</HI> viz. <HI>That Queen</HI> Elizabeth <HI>would do well to have no meddling with the Affairs of</HI> Scotland, <HI>but leave them to the Discretion of their princes; seeing neither she nor her Husband did offer to trouble themselves with her Subjects.</HI></NOTE> bid to mind her own Business,
and not to concern her self in these Matters.</P>
<P>The Duke of <HI>Chatellerault</HI> seeing the Queen
both resolute and powerful, made his Peace,
and was well received.</P>
<P>The Assembly met as usual, and sollicited
the Queen still to encrease and settle the Stipends
of their Ministers, in which they did at length
obtain some Supply; but in the Affair of Reli∣gion
it self, they received no Satisfaction at all.</P>
<P>The Broils of the Court, and the Murther
of <HI>David Rizzio</HI> began the Year 1565. <HI>Spotswood</HI>
in his History, <HI>fol.</HI> 195, makes very good Re∣marks
on this, <HI>viz.</HI> That it had been much bet∣ter
to have brought him to publick Justice,
and executed him by the Hand of<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Buchanan <HI>says, they designed to hang hang him publickly, but that</HI> Morton, <HI>and his Men, had not Patience enough with him.</HI></NOTE> the Hang∣man;
for it brought on all the Miseries which
followed, one on the Neck of another, almost
to the Ruin of the Nation, and effectually to
the Ruin of the King, and in the End, of the
Queen also.</P>
<P>The Queen resolved to ruin the Lords, who
were fled, called a Parliament, to forefault or
attaint them: In this Parliament, say<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 4. fol. 195. The Queen designing he should act as Chanceller in this Parliament,</HI> Morton <HI>who, after</HI> Hunt∣ley's Death, had supplied that Place, took it as an Affr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt to him.</NOTE> some,
she designed to make <HI>Rizzio</HI> Chancellor, and
<PB N="59" REF="62"/>
this occasioned <HI>Morton</HI>'s falling upon him. O∣thers
say, he had plotted the Destruction of the
Nobility, and had proposed to the Queen the
cutting them off by way of Massacre. Again,
he is charged with a scandalous Familiarity
with the Queen, which, whether it were true,
or that it was suggested to the King to irri∣tate
him, and bring him to be concerned in the
Fact, is not material farther than this; that by
it, the Enmity between the Queen and him,
which was before begun, was made so irrecon∣cileable,
that as <HI>he never rested</HI> till he had caused
the <HI>Italian</HI> to be murthered, <HI>the Queen never re∣sted</HI>
till she had caused her Husband to be mur∣thered,
and divine Justice, after all, <HI>never rest∣ed</HI>
till it had caused her to be murthered; so
that Blood followed Blood till that whole Knot
was destroyed. And thus the Enemies of the
Reformation made Way, by their own Destru∣ction,
for the more legal and more peaceable
compleating of this great Work of the Refor∣mation,
to the Glory of God, and the Honour
of true Religion, as shall presently appear.</P>
<P>The Murther of this obscure Fellow however
had this Influence, that upon this Prospect of
the Lords of the Court engaging with the King
against <HI>David Rizzio,</HI> the banished Lords took
Courage to come home, and the Parliament be∣ing
sitting, offered themselves to Tryal, and no
Body appearing against them, the Lords being
all bandyed into Parties on the other Occasion,
they were acquitted; again the Queen terrified
with the Strength of her Husband's Party, and
the Resolution which they appeared to have
taken, fac'd about to the Lords that had fled,
received them into Favour, and bent her Fury
at the Murtherers of her Favourite.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="63"/>
In this Juncture she was brought to Bed of a Son,
who was afterwards King <HI>James</HI> VI, who was
born in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Castle on the <HI>19th</HI> of <HI>June,</HI>
in a little Room facing the Castle-Hill, which
is still remembred as the Birth-Place of that
King. 'Tis reported she was so irritated at the
King for the Murther of <HI>Rizzio,</HI> that she had
determined to destroy the Child, as not bear∣ing
to nourish any Thing of his begetting. I
do not say this was any more than a Report;
but it gives us a Hint of the Spirit that then
reigned, and she having, as there is Reason to
believe, at the same Time resolved to murther
the Father, it might not be improbable she had
as barbarous Thoughts towards the Child. But
God had other Designs to bring to pass in this
Birth, whether for the Good or Ill of the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Consequence will make appear.</P>
<P>Another Note is made here upon this Prince,
how justly I will not determine, <HI>viz.</HI> That the
Fright and Terror his Mother was in, at the
drawn Swords which were in the Hands of the
Persons employed in this Attempt, (for <HI>Rizzio</HI>
was fallen upon in her Presence) so far influenc'd
the Child in her Womb, that his Retentives
generally fail'd him at the Sight of Weapons
ever after.—<HI>But this by the Way.</HI> 'Tis no Scan∣dal
to say of him, he was no Man of War.</P>
<P>The Assembly being then sitting, they sent
some of their Number to congratulate the Queen
on the Birth of a Son, and humbly to desire
the Prince might be baptized into the Protestant
Church: The Queen gave no Answer to it at
that Time, but very effectually made a Reply to
it afterwards, causing him to be baptized after
the Popish Manner, at <HI>Sterling</HI> Castle, by the
Archbishop of St. <HI>Andrews.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="64"/>
The Church now began to see which Way
Things were going; for the Queen not only
honoured the Archbishop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> with
the baptizing the Prince, but gave him also a
Commission, whereby he was restored to his
ancient Jurisdiction in several Things, which
clash'd with their Authority; such as confirming
Testaments, Collation to Benefices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> both
which being directly contrary to the Acts of
Parliament, which established the <HI>Reformation,</HI>
and to the true Interest of the Protestant Set∣tlement,
the Assembly was exceedingly alarm'd
at it; but finding it in vain to address the Queen
any more, they formed a Paper in manner of
an Appeal; but called it a Supplication, dire∣cted,
<HI>as appears in the Title,</HI> to the Nobility and
Lords of the secret Council, who had profess'd
Jesus Christ, and who had renounced the <HI>Ro∣man</HI>
Antichrist: These Proceedings on both
Sides, ripened Things for the sudden Change
which soon after followed.</P>
<P>The Murther of the King was the next Tra∣gedy
that came on the Stage of this unhappy
Court: The Queen, after her being delivered of
a Son, and, if she had the wicked Design of
murthering it, being prevented the Execution
of that Murther, retired to <HI>Alloway,</HI> a House of
the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> near <HI>Sterling;</HI> the King fol∣lowed
her, but was refused Admittance, (she
resolving to have no more of his Race, as she
openly declared) and was treated with great Con∣tempt.—Upon
this the King, (say some, with
Grief<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Buchanan, <HI>Hist. Eng. says, he fell sick: The Queen ha∣ving given him Poyson, which, working before its Time, broke out all over his Body, and so Nature expelled the Poison.</HI></NOTE> <HI>others say,</HI> by Poyson) fell sick, and was
<PB N="62" REF="65"/>
carried to <HI>Glasgow.</HI> The Queen, after some
Time, whether she relented at her Usage of
him, or whether in the Plot for his Ruine, or
whether <HI>Bothwell</HI> formed his Destruction upon
an Apprehension of the Queen's being reconci∣led
to him at that Time, <HI>is uncertain</HI> to this Hour;
but she went to visit him, and after some Words
they were openly reconciled again, and the
King was, at the Queen's Appointment, carried
to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he had not been many Days
but he was most barbarously murthered in his
Bed, and the House blown up with Gunpowder,
as by the Histories of those Times more large∣ly
is to be seen.</P>
<P>It is not to the Case to enquire here into the
Manner and Circumstances of this Barbarity, and
who did it, of all which, Authors also<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 4. fol.</HI> 200.—<HI>says</HI>—Bothwel <HI>came upon him, in the Night, as he lay asleep, and strangled him—</HI></NOTE>,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Buchanan <HI>says, it was the Conspirators, but seems not to be positive, that</HI> Bothwell <HI>did it with his own Hands, tho' he owns him in the Conspiracy.</HI></NOTE> dif∣fer.
All agree that it was vilely contrived be∣tween
the Queen and <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and more vilely
executed by <HI>Bothwell,</HI> either in Person or by his
Agents.</P>
<P>But I am, by the Course of Things, hasten∣ing
to the great Revolution which now hap∣pened,
and which all these horrid Things were
but as so many preparatory Steps to bring to
pass.</P>
<P>First, the abominable Marriage between <HI>Both∣well</HI>
and the Queen, which was brought to pass
soon after, which made the Matter so black that
nothing could be worse, next to owning the
<PB N="63" REF="66"/>
Fact, <HI>viz.</HI> That a Woman should link her self
in Marriage to the Murtherer of her Husband.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Her Behaviour at the Parliament
which then approach'd, where she positively
refused all that was desired of her in behalf of
he Reformation, and behaved with a quite dif∣erent
Air from all she had done formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Manifest Designs and secret Attempts
of the Queen to get the Custody of her Son
out of the Hands of the Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> who claim'd
it by Birth as hereditary Keeper of the King's
Children.</P>
<P>The first Step to what followed was by the
Earl of <HI>Athol,</HI> who, fully satisfied of the Guilt
of <HI>Bothwell</HI> in the Murther of the King, and
meditating how he might with most Ease bring
him to Justice, begins to start among the No∣bility
his just Suspicions, that the same Villainy
might be practised upon the Infant as had been
upon the Father.</P>
<P>Upon this the Protestant Lords appoint a
Meeting at <HI>Sterling,</HI> in order to protect and
secure the Person of the <HI>Prince:</HI> And in this
Meeting the Destruction of Popery, Treason,
and Murther took its Rise: They all met with
their Fate together, and this abominable Genesration,
with their short liv'd Joy, vanished in
Stink and Smoak, being grown noysome to the
whole World by the most horrid Actions that
were ever read of.</P>
<P>The Queen, hearing of this Meeting, and
that the Lords had entered into Bond, one to
another, for mutual Assistance, pretends a Jour∣ney,
to visit the Borders, and thereby, accord∣ing
to Custom, summons the Subjects to attend
her with Arms and Provisions for 15 Days:
Upon this, a Rumour being spread that the
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
Queen designed to seize on the young Prince,
and take him from the Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> the Lords
aforesaid take Arms, the Queen publishes a De∣claration
that she does not design to remove the
Prince; but this not satisfying the Lords, they
surround her in <HI>Brothwick</HI> Castle, but not being
able entirely to invest the Place, <HI>Bothwell</HI> and
the Queen make their Escape to <HI>Dunbar,</HI> and
then, tho' too late, she raises Forces.</P>
<P>The Lords advanc'd to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the
Queen to <HI>Musscelburgh,</HI> but when the Armies fa∣ced
one another, the Queen's Men did not care to
fight, <HI>Bothwell</HI>'s Guilt was too great, his Heart
fail'd him, and he ran away: The Queen, who
had both more Courage and more Presence of
Mind, staid, but was obliged to put her self
into the Hands of the Lords, who carried her
to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and from thence, shewing her in∣deed
but very little Respect, sent her Prisoner
to the Castle of <HI>Loch-Leven.</HI> Thus ended the
Reign of Popery in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I mean barefac'd
profess'd, down right Popery; as for Popery
in Masquerade, eventual Popery, disguised Po∣pery,
'tis but a very few Years since that went
off the Stage also; and we shall, in the Course
of these Memoirs, see many a Farce of its acting,
and some bloody Tragedies also, till at length it
vanish'd with as much Contempt as the other.</P>
<P><HI>Buchanan</HI> tells us<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Buch. lib. 18. fol. 195. Cum ad secundam aciem perv<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣nisset, concors ab omnibus clamor sublatus est, ut meretricem, ut parricidam cremarent.

surrendred her self to the Lords, the second <HI>Bat∣talia,</HI>
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
or Line of the Men, when she came among
them, used her very barbarously, and cried out
for putting her to Death, painting a Standard
with the murthered King and his little Son
lying by him, and displaying it before her.</P>
<P>It was, without doubt, a very great Revolu∣tion,
and in it the Justice of Heaven visibly
pursued the Murther of the King, the Barbarity
of which hath hardly had its Parallel in any
Age: And as this is one of the Reasons why
I enter into that Part of the Story, so tho' I
cannot go through all the Particulars, yet I can∣not
but remind the Reader of one nice Reflecti∣on,
<HI>viz.</HI> That tho' Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> is blam'd,
and perhaps justly, for putting her to Death af∣terwards;
yet it is plain it was the Work of a
superior Power, and that Vengeance, which fol∣lowed
them all, suffered her not to live.</P>
<P><HI>Bothwell,</HI> who had been the chief Contriver and
Acter of the whole Tragedy, never saw her
more; he fled to <HI>Shetland,</HI> an Island in the
<HI>North,</HI> where, for a while, he turned Pyrate;
but being beaten from thence, he fled to <HI>Den∣mark,</HI>
where he was taken up, by the King's
Order, and kept in a loathsome Prison, and being
reduced to extream Poverty, lived about Ten
Years in a Jail, and at last died raving mad.</P>
<P>The Archbishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> who, as <HI>Bu∣chanan</HI>
relates, had been one of those that vo∣luntarily
undertook the Murther, was hang'd by
the Regent, the Earl of <HI>Murray;</HI> being taken
in the Surprize of <HI>Dunbarton</HI> Castle.</P>
<P><HI>John Hamilton,</HI> who was one of the Actors,
dyed of Grief, after he confest the Murther to
a Priest the School-Master at <HI>Paisley.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69"/>
Even <HI>Morton</HI> himself, who had the least Con∣cern
in it, and at most was no otherwise guilty
than that he knew of it, and concealed it after
it was done, was beheaded for that Concealment
many Years after at the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen's Guilt was particularly demon∣strated
by her own Letters, taken in <HI>Bothwell</HI>'s
Silver Cabinet; where, under her Hand, she
transacted the whole Affair with him; and a∣mong
which was a Contract of Marriage, sign∣ed
by her own Hand, to him, in her Husband's
Life, to be consummated after he should be
dispatched<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Buch. lib. 19. fol. 201.

<P>These Things made her Guilt so plain, that
her Name became odious to all the World:
And the Regent afterward made them all so
plain to every Body's Understanding, when he
was at <HI>London,</HI> and when the Queen of <HI>England</HI>
enquired of the Reasons why they deposed their
Sovereign, that, the same Author says, Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> declared, <HI>she was not worthy to be assist∣ed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/>
And yet after all this Aversion manifested
to her Person, and Detestation of her Crime,
she formed such Parties among the People, who,
after the first Heat, began to relent and com∣miserate
her, that she found Means to escape out
of <HI>Lochleven</HI> Castle, and raise new Commotions.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Nobility considered of
settling the Government, and of entirely deposing
the Queen: The first Step to this was, by pro∣curing
her to demit or resign the Crown: she
at first resolutely opposed it, but afterwards
sign'd<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 4. fol. 211. She was perswaded to it by</HI> Robert Melvill, <HI>who was sent from the Earls of</HI> Athol <HI>and</HI> Lethington, <HI>to aduise her as she loved her Life not to refuse them any thing they should require. He likewise brought a Let∣ter from Sir</HI> Nicholas Throckmorton, <HI>the Ambassador from</HI> England, <HI>to the same Effect, declaring,</HI> That no Resignati∣on, made in the Time of her Captivity, would be of any Force, and in Law was null, because done out of a just Fear.</NOTE> any Thing they brought her, as 'tis
said, without so much as reading it, <HI>upon this
Foundation,</HI> that being under Confinement, no∣thing
she did now could be binding upon her
for the future.</P>
<P>Thus she signed several Instruments, one for
the Surrender of the Crown, renouncing and
demitting the Government in Favour of her
Son, commissioning the Lords for his solemn In∣vestiture:
One other was a Power to some No∣blemen
to make the solemn Resignation, in her
Name, in the publick Meeting of the States:
One other was for nominating the Earl of
<HI>Murray,</HI> who was then in <HI>France,</HI> Regent of the
Kingdom in the Minority of her Son: And the
other for naming Governours to her Son. But
afterwards when she made her Escape out of
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
<HI>Lochleven,</HI> she revok'd all those Writings as done
by her under the Restraint of a Prison, and
under Terror of her Life, which they say the
Lord <HI>Lindsay</HI> threatned when he came to her
with the Instruments. However, the Lords
took her at her first Word, and in the mean
Time proceeded upon the Authority of these
Demissions, and having put all other Things in
order, they proclaimed her Son King of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and crowned him <HI>July 29, anno</HI> 1567, and made
<HI>James,</HI> Earl of <HI>Murray,</HI> Regent, tho' then absent
in <HI>France.</HI> This is the same I have always cal∣led
Lord <HI>James,</HI> being the Queen's half Brother,
who was after called the <HI>good Regent,</HI> and who
was, under God, the blessed Instrument of the
establishing the Reformation in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>The Queen, as I noted, having made her E∣scape,
raises an Army about <HI>Hamilton,</HI> the Re∣gent,
tho' inferiour in Number, marches to <HI>Glas∣gow,</HI>
and at <HI>Langside,</HI> a Village not far from <HI>Glas∣gow,</HI>
gives her Battle, and her Forces being over∣thrown,
she fled into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There she past a long Imprisonment, by Order
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> during which for carrying
ou innumerable Plots and Contrivances against
the said Queen and her Subjects, she was at last
brought to the Block, on Pretence of con∣spiring
against the <HI>English.</HI>—Whether their
Pretence against her was just or no, I do not
determine; but that Justice pursued her, as is
said before, for the most abominable Fact a∣bove,
I mean the Murther of her Husband, I
think is plain from all Histories of those Times.</P>
<P>The Realm was now under the Conduct of
the <HI>Regent,</HI> the King an Infant, and they had
brought the Queen to make a Kind of Assent
to the crowning her Son, and to appoint him
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
Governours. The Regent managed with a Pru∣dence
not to be described; in Diligence unwea∣ried,
in Action undaunted, in Government sa∣gacious,
in Religion zealous, and exceeding pi∣ous,
in Life sedate, and in his violent Death
patient and resigned.—He was barbarously mur∣thered
by <HI>James Hamilton,</HI> set to work by the
Queen's Party: He shot him through the Body
in the Street at <HI>Lithgo,</HI> as he was riding out of
the Pallace amidst a great Throng of the People
crouding to see him: The Murtherer made his
Escape out of a Back-Door, and could not be
apprehended.</P>
<P>Upon this Disaster, great Contention follow∣ed
among the several Parties: The Nobility
came several Times together in order to chuse
a new Regent, and parted without bringing it to
a Conclusion, and the Queen's Party grew very
strong, particularly the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> sided
with her. At last <HI>Matthew,</HI> Earl of <HI>Lenox,</HI> Fa∣ther
to the late murthered King, was chosen
Regent.</P>
<P>He carried on the War against the Queen's
Party, and taking Possession of <HI>Leith,</HI> had seve∣ral
Skirmishes with her Troops, as at <HI>Leith, Dal∣keith,</HI>
and other Places; but at last he is sur∣prized at <HI>Sterling,</HI> with a great many of the
Nobility and Gentry, by a Party of the Queen's
Men, who take the Town by Surprize, and took
the Regent, the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> and sundry
other Prisoners; but the Queen's Men being beat
out of the Town again, and forc'd to quit their
Prisoners, the Regent was shot through by him
that had him Prisoner, because he could not
carry him off; for which Fact he was afterwards
hang'd, as he well deserved.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="73"/>
The Lord <HI>Ereskine,</HI> E. of <HI>Mar,</HI> was then chosen
Regent; but the Queen's Interest was so strong at
that Time, and the King's so weak, that there was
great Danger of a new Turn in Affairs, and Po∣pery
began to hold up its Head; but they had
the Pleasure of being disappointed in that Parti∣cular
also, by the Turn of Affairs in <HI>England</HI>
with the Queen; who, on a Discovery of her
Plot there with the Duke of <HI>Norfolk,</HI> was closer
confined, and afterwards tryed for her Life,
and beheaded: With her fell all the Hopes of
Popery in <HI>Scotland.</HI> But the Church found other
Enemies to struggle with, in some Respects, as
fatal to her Prosperity as the Papists, of which
we shall find Cause to speak more particularly
in the Second Part of this Work.</P>
<P>But to return to the Affairs in Hand. As
this Revolution was against the Interest of
the Queen and her Party, so it was a farther,
and, I think, I may call it a compleat Establish∣ment
of the Church; for whatever Factions and
Parties were form'd in the State, the Nobility
frequently changing Parties as their Interests and
Fortunes guided them, yet they all joined in
the Matter of the Reformation, and the confe∣derated
Lords were entirely in the Interest of
Religion: But to look into this we must go
back again to the first seizing the Queen.</P>
<P>The Earl of <HI>Murray</HI> being declared Regent,
as above, was, while he lived, a very great Fur∣therance
to the Establishment of the Church:
That great Man being not only a vigorous and
constant Friend to the Reformation, but a most
pious, religious and sincere Professor of it him∣self</P>
<P>Things heing in so good a Posture for the
Church, when the Queen was taken Prisoner,
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
the first Parliament was holden at <HI>Edinburgh De∣cember</HI>
15, 1567, in the Name of the King, tho'
but an Infant; and the first Thing they went
about was, to recognize the whole Proceedings
of the Reformation in the following Acts.</P>
<P><HI>1st,</HI> An Act abolishing the Jurisdiction and
usurp'd Authority of the Pope, which was
still no more than confirming the Act
made before for that Purpose; but it was
done because the Papists raised some Obje∣ctions
against the Validity of that Parlia∣ment,
the Queen having not given her As∣sent
to their Meeting, nor confirmed the
Articles at <HI>Leith.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2d,</HI> Another Act past, for repealing former
Laws for establishing Popery.</P>
<P><HI>3d,</HI> The Confession of Faith was ratified.</P>
<P><HI>4th,</HI> An Act appointing, That all Kings and
Magistrates should, at the Time of enter∣ing
upon their Offices, swear to maintain
the Church, expressed in these Words: <HI>To
maintain the true Religion as now received.</HI></P>
<P>The Polity and Jurisdiction of the Church
was, <HI>says Spotswood,</HI> referred to Delegates, and
the Thirds of Benefices were, for the present,
granted to the Church; the Necessity of the Times
made it impossible to obtain the rest: For the
publick Affairs requiring the Assistance of all its
Interest, the remaining Revenues of the Church
were retained to the Service of the Nation.</P>
<P>In this Parliament the King's Authority be∣ing
acknowledged, the Queen, his Mother, was
concluded <HI>to perpetual Imprisonment,</HI> which was
then thought very severe, and brought a great
many to espouse her Quarrel, in meer Compas∣sion
<PB N="72" REF="75"/>
to her Circumstances; and this, facilitating
her Escape, as before, filled the Nation with a
long Series of Blood, Tumult, and Disorder.</P>
<P>Yet under all these Turmoils the Church
was supported in her Jurisdiction, as well as
Doctrine; and therefore here I fix the Period
of what I call her Infant-State: And I think
my Opinion is back'd very much by that fa∣mous
Letter of the General Assembly of the
Kirk, <HI>Anno</HI> 1567, being the same Year I am
now upon.</P>
<P>The Letter was to Mr. <HI>Willock,</HI> one of their
Ministers, and one who was particularly famous
for his Share in the Reformation; but was fled
into <HI>England</HI> from the Troubles of the first
Years of the Queen's Return: This Man the
Assembly writes to, to invite him to come back
again: And their Reasons to move him to re∣turn
were, `That they had a religious and zea∣lous
Magistrate constituted, meaning the Earl
of <HI>Murray,</HI> commonly called the <HI>Gude Regent;</HI>
sufficient Provision appointed for Ministers, the
Church established, and Religion flourishing
throughout the Realm—and they conclude
their Letter, <HI>Now you shall see the Cope-Stone of
that Work whereof you laid the Foundation.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that the Book of Polity or Disci∣pline
was not to this Day establish'd by Par∣liament,
and therefore the Church had not all
the Authority that they wish'd in the Matters
of Jurisdiction, Government, and Discipline.
But the Gentlemen that would dispute here the
Priority of Episcopal Government in the Church
to Presbyterial, will get nothing by that; for
all this while the Church exercised a compleat
Presbyterial Jurisdiction, and no other; had
their exact regular Meetings of Kirk or pa∣rochial
<PB N="73" REF="76"/>
Sessions, Presbyteries, Synods, and Ge∣neral
Assemblies.</P>
<P>The Nobility, upon all Occasions, signed the
Book of Discipline, and the Book of Polity was
frequently revised, and in this Parliament was
ordered to be revised again.</P>
<P>The Bishops that remained, had nothing left
them but a ministerial Authority, and were e∣qually
subjected to Presbytery, Synod, and As∣sembly;
and the Superintendency, of which so
much is alledged to prove it an Equivalent to
Episcopacy, was under all the essential Articles
of a Parity; a famous Instance of which was
the Bishop of <HI>Orkney,</HI> whowao, as a private Mi∣nister,
censured in the first Assembly of the King,
for solemnizing the adulterous Marriage of the
Queen with <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and was deprived by them
by virtue of an Act of Assembly against marry∣ing
a divorced Adulterer; for such, it appear∣ed,
<HI>Bothwell</HI> was<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol. 44. He was deprived till the As∣sembly was satisfied for the Scandal.</HI></NOTE>, having been divorced from
his Wife to come into that horrid Marriage.</P>
<P>Again, the next General Assembly, <HI>An.</HI> 1568.
the said Bishop was<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>He is restored to his Ministry, but they ordained that
he publickly make a Confession of his Faith in the Kirk of</HI> Haly∣Rood-House, <HI>on the Lord's-Day, at the End of Sermon.</HI></NOTE> restored, upon his Hu∣miliation,
and satisfying the Assembly.</P>
<P><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>And the Superintendents of</HI> Angus <HI>and</HI> Louthian <HI>were to report their Diligence to the next Assembly.</HI></NOTE> At the same Assembly the Superintendent
of <HI>Fife</HI> was censured for his Negligence in Visi∣tation,
and that he was careless in punishing A∣dulterers.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77"/>
These are such plain Acts of Presbyterial Ju∣risdiction
over the Superintendents, that nothing
can be needful to add to it. In the same Assem∣bly
was the Form of Excommunication appro∣ved,
and ordered to be printed, and is affixed
just before the Psalms in Meeter.</P>
<P>One other Thing is very essential to this De∣bate,
which will be also found at large in <HI>Calder∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>od</HI>'s History, <HI>fol.</HI> 45.</P>
<P>The Principal, and some of the Regents of the
College at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> were deprived by order of
the Assembly, for refusing to acknowledge the se∣veral
Laws of establishing the Church, and other
Things objected; but they were deprived not
by the Superintendent, but by the Superinten∣dent,
together with the Ministers and Commissi∣oners,
and the Superintendent acted only as Com∣missioner
from the Assembly, as is to this Day
to be seen in the Register.</P>
<P>As to Discipline the Practice of it was, tho'
not established, yet every Day regulated and
directed by the Assembly. And if there were
any difficult Things in Matters of Order and
Dicipline, it was only owing to this, that the
Polity of the Church was not perfected and
settled.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Have fix'd the Period of the Church's
Infancy at the dethroning Queen
<HI>Mary,</HI> when the glorious Top∣Stone
of the Reformation seem'd
to be laid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the
Church arrived to a Condition to stand upon
her own Feet.</P>
<P>Her doctrinal Articles were assented to, and
her Worship establish'd, and both confirmed
by sundry Acts of Parliament, under the Ad∣ministration
<PB N="76" REF="79"/>
of the first Regents, the Earl of
<HI>Murray,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Lenox:</HI> Likewise her
Judicatories took Place, her Churches were
planted, and her Discipline was agreed to, so
that as, in the Letter of the Assembly to Mr.
<HI>Willock,</HI> is noted, <HI>The Church was fully planted:</HI>
As to her intestine Troubles, they seemed in∣deed
to be but begun; for the Polity of the
<HI>Kirk,</HI> it was not yet establish'd, nor could they
ever bring the Book of Discipline to be past in∣to
an Act in the Convention or Parliament of
that Day. At this Door crept in all the Mis∣chiefs
that for above 120 Years after, continu∣ally
harrass'd this Church, and brought her se∣veral
Times under the Yoke, both of temporal
and ecclesiastick Tyranny; several Times into
cruel and bloody Persecutions, and more than
once to the very Gates of Destruction, as shall
be seen in its Order.</P>
<P>The Church had been now 14 Years in her
first Struggles with Popery, had enjoyed her
General Assemblies 12 Years, and tho' the Go∣vernment
of the Church was not past into a
Law by the Civil Sanction of a Parliament, as
is observed above, yet the greatest Part of the
Nobility and Gentry had signed it; and all that
Part which was needful to the true Discipline
of the Church was fully practised by the Mi∣nisters
in their particular Churches, and fre∣quently
regulated in their General Assemblies.</P>
<P>But as in all the Ages of the Church, the
Prosperity of their Affairs has led them into
mutual Jarrings, Divisions, and Jealousies, which
consequently ushered in Multitudes of Innovati∣ons;
<HI>so it was here:</HI> The Ambition and Emula∣tion
of the Clergy and Nobility ushered in a
Model of Episcopal Government, which, as it
<PB N="77" REF="80"/>
was at first a <HI>Motley Scheme</HI> of Church-Govern∣ment,
composed neither of Presbytery nor Pre∣lacy,
so it laid the Foundation of its own Cor∣ruptions,
and in them of all the Confusions
which followed in the Church, as will appear
hereafter.</P>
<P>The first Step to this, was in the Year 1572,
when, upon the old Foot of settling and per∣fecting
the Polity of the Church, that fatal
Commission was granted <HI>to settle the Kirk,</HI> of
which in its Place. The Regent was now the
Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> who, tho' a Protestant, was, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>seems, particularly inclined to the <HI>new Scheme</HI> of
Church-Government which had been proposed
in an Assembly or Convention of the Church
at <HI>Leith,</HI> viz. to restore the Government of
<HI>Bishops</HI> as it was in the Time before the Refor∣mation:
And as there was a strong Party even
among the Ministers who fell in with the Court,
and no doubt the Hopes of Church-Preferment
had moved some, they soon were prevail'd with
to join with the Party that pretended to settle
the Church according to that Scheme.</P>
<P>In order to this, a Commission was grant∣ed
to a certain Number of Gentlemen to treat
with a like Number of Ministers, to be com∣missioned
by the General Assembly, and to con∣sider
of, settle, and conclude anent all Things
tending to the Establishing the <HI>Polity of the Kirk.</HI></P>
<P>And this was that famous, or rather fatal
Commission which first brought Episcopacy into
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and their Act was expres∣sed
in these Words:</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol.</HI> 50.</NOTE> “They think good, in Consideration of
the present Estate, that the Names and Titles
<PB N="78" REF="81"/>
of Archbishops and Bishops be not innova∣ted,
nor the Bounds of the Diocesses confound∣ed—but
stand and continue in Time coming
as they did before the Reformation, at leasttill
the King's Majority, or till Consent of
Parliament.”</P>
<P>Episcopacy being thus brought in, as we call
it, by Head and Shoulders into the Church,
did not, however, answer their End who brought
it in; for at first it came in so fetter'd and
shackled with Limitation of Power and Castra∣tion
of Stipends, that there was little in it
more than was before in the Ministers, who
were called <HI>Superintendents;</HI> the Name and Dig∣nities
excepted. And here it is worth obser∣ving,
that the true Reason appeared both why
the Church could never obtain a Parliamentary
Establishment of their Book of Discipline, as al∣so
why the Nobility and Gentry fell in so sud∣denly
with this new Model; the Case is very
plain: Under this Model the Gentlemen retain∣ed
to themselves the Revenues of the Church
either in Temporalities <HI>feu'd</HI> to themselves, as
they call it in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or Pensions and Payments
which they obtained<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol. 51. Hence they were called Tul∣chane</HI> Bishops: <HI>A Tulchane is a Calf-Skin stuffed with Str<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> plac'd to make the Cow give Milk; for now the Bishop had the Title, which was but the Straw, but the Lord got the Milk <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Benefice.</HI></NOTE> from the Church-Men
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which they could never before obtain under the
Ministers; for the Ministers would not so far be∣tray
the Church as to alienate her Revenues to
the Courtiers and Gentry. But now it was done
effectually, and the Gentlemen hold many of
these Things to this Day, to the great Impove∣rishment,
<PB N="79" REF="82"/>
as well as Discouragement of the
Church, and Hinderance of the Planting Mini∣sters
in many Parts of the Country.</P>
<P>However, the Clergy found Ways to help
themselves as to the Revenue in after Times.
This was the first Condition they came into the
Church in, and this simoniacal Project, for it
was no less, (<HI>viz.</HI>) giving Part of the Church's
Revenues to the Nobility, that they might have
their Vote to possess the rest; this simoniacal
Project, I say, was the first Reason of the In∣troduction
of Bishops into the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>We shall now see how this Matter relish'd
with the Reformers, and whether, as some al∣ledge,
it was a general Act of the Reformation,
<HI>YEA,</HI> or <HI>NO.</HI> In <HI>February.</HI> 1572, a new Bi∣shop
was inaugurated at St. <HI>Andrews:</HI> Mr. <HI>Knox</HI>
protested against it, and pronounced his Ana∣thema,
or great Curse against both Giver and
Receiver.</P>
<P>But the Case was much altered in <HI>Scotland</HI> at
this Time among the Gentry and Nobility.
(1.) Abundance of the first Reformers, debauch∣ed
by the Luxury of the Court, and touch'd
upon the Niceties of Allegiance, adhered to the
Queen, who was Popish, tho' they themselves
were Protestants; such was the Duke of <HI>Chatel∣lerault,</HI>
the Earls of <HI>Argyle, Rothess,</HI> Laird of
<HI>Grange,</HI> and others. (2.) Of the rest, the Inte∣rest
of the Nobility in the Church's Revenues,
made them all slack in the Matter of the Church
<HI>Polity,</HI> shy of the extraordinary Authority of the
Assembly, and averse to the Severity of Disci∣pline.</P>
<P>The two first Regents the Earls of <HI>Murray</HI>
and <HI>Lenox,</HI> adher'd honestly and faithfully to the
Church, and were the constant Patrons of her
<PB N="80" REF="83"/>
Settlement: The Earl of <HI>Mar,</HI> the third Regent,
was both zealous for the Reformation, and re∣ligious
in his Person; but gave way a little too
early to the abovementioned Court-Principle, I
mean as to their retaining the Church's Reve∣nues.
But the Earl of <HI>Morton,</HI> who succeeded
him, openly invaded the Authority of the As∣sembly,
and throwing off the Mask, protected
the Bishops in usurping an Authority indepen∣dent
of the Assembly; and by the same Conse∣quence,
placing an Authority in the Prince to
appoint the Bishop. And thus he did the Drudg∣ery
of the Party, for which they ill rewarded
him afterward, as will appear in the Course of
this Story.</P>
<P>The first Introduction of Bishops, as above,
left them fetter'd and shackled, as I noted, under
the Power of the Assembly; and tho' even the
Name gave Offence, yet they were so reduc'd,
as that the Name began not to be questioned,
and such the Church will not dispute to this
Day: For tho' they were allow'd to be called
Bishops, yet they were really only Superinten∣dents,
and not that neither very long; for the
Assembly, <HI>Anno</HI> 1574, voted the Bishops to be
only Pastors of one Parish, and delated several
of them afterward for not preaching, and for
not attending at their<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 5, fol. 226. The Question was proposed to the Assembly, whether Bishops, as they were then in</HI> Scotland, <HI>had their Function warranted by the Word of God. The Assembly, without giving a direct Answer, approved the Opinion of the last Assembly, with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>is Addition,</HI> “That Bishops should be∣take themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Service of some one Church within their Diocess, and name the particular Flock of which they would acce<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Charge.”</NOTE> Charge:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>The Bishop of</HI> Du<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keld <HI>was deposed by the Assembly for Dilapidations.</HI></NOTE> The Bi∣shop
<PB N="81" REF="84"/>
of <HI>Dunkeld</HI> was actually deposed by the
Assembly. The Bishop of <HI>Glasgow</HI> was delated
for not preaching—The Superintendent of
<HI>Louthian</HI> was censur'd for inaugurating the Bi∣shop
of <HI>Ross,</HI> when he was admonished by the
Assembly not to do it.</P>
<P>Innumerable Instances are to be found in the
History of those Times, as well of Superinten∣dents
as of Bishops, who were tried and cen∣sured
by the Assembly. On the other Hand,
Bishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> affirms positively, that the Su∣perintendent's
Power was Episcopal; but gives
not one Instance to prove it.</P>
<P>At last the grand Affair came before the Ass∣embly,
and was then decisively asserted; for
the Assembly, beginning to see themselves en∣croached
upon, came immediately to the Root
of the Question, <HI>Whether the Function of a Bi∣shop
be warranted by the Word of God.</HI> The
Name of Bishop no Body disputed, but the Ex∣tent
of the Title and Office was the Thing.</P>
<P>In the <HI>6th</HI> Session of the Assembly 1575, the
Brethren did not conclude finally, but came to
this Resolution, that they asserted their own Su∣periority<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol. 69. If any Bishop be chosen who hath not such Qualities as the Word of God requireth, let him be tried by the General Assembly,</HI> DE NOVO, <HI>and let him be depo∣sed if there be Cause.</HI></NOTE>, and their Power to turn the Bi∣shop
out, after which they stated the Thing in
general thus.</P>
<P>1. “That the Name of Bishop is common
to every one that hath a particular Flock,
over which he hath a peculiar Charge; as
well to preach the Word, and to minister
Sacraments, as to execute ecclesiastical Dis∣cipline,
<PB N="82" REF="85"/>
with Consent of his Elders.—And
this is his chief Function by the Word of
God.”</P>
<P>“Out of the Number of Bishops some
may be chosen to have Power to oversee
and visit such reasonable Bounds, besides
his own Flock, as the General Assembly
shall appoint; and in these Bounds to ap∣point
Ministers, with the Consent of the
Ministers of that Province, and with the
<NOTE PLACE="marg">☞</NOTE> Consent of the Flock, [<HI>MARK THAT</HI>]
to whom they shall be appointed: As also
to appoint Elders and Deacons in every
particular Congregation, where there is
none, with Consent of the People thereof,
[<HI>MARK THAT ALSO</HI>] and to sus∣pend
Ministers for reasonable Causes, with
Consent of the Ministers aforesaid.”</P>
<P>This is, in short the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s
first Opinion of the <HI>Office</HI> of a Bishop: They
did not declare directly against the very Word
<HI>Bishop;</HI> for the Court run high for the new Pro∣ject,
and they were<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood,</HI> fol. 69. They answered not directly to the Question at this Time, by Reason of the Regent's Authority, who was bent upon the Course whereof he was the chief Instrument, yet they agreed upon such Points as overthrow the Authority and Power of a Bishop.</NOTE> not forward to fly in
the Face of the Regent, yet they were resolute
in the Substance of the Thing.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that when these Reso∣lutions
were past in the Assembly, there were
present, the Archbishop of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> the Bishops
of <HI>Dunkeld, Galloway, Brichen, Dumblain,</HI> and
<HI>Iles;</HI> and all these, by their Silence, acknow∣ledg'd
they understood themselves to be Bishops
<PB N="83" REF="86"/>
in such a Sense; and <HI>Spotswood</HI> complains upon
them for it.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><P>Spotswood, <HI>lib. 1. fol. 276. It doth not appear by the Register of these Proceedings, that the Bishops who were present, did so much as open their Mouths in defence of their Office and Calling: What it was that made them so quiet, whether, as I have heard, that they expected these Motions shou'd have been dash'd by the Regent, or otherwise, that they affected the Praise of Humility, is unknown; which was no Wisdom in them to have given way to such Novelties, and have suffered the Lawfulness of their Vocation to be thus called in Question.</HI></P>

<P>Thus the Church asserted her Authority, and
the Project of the Court was very much disap∣pointed.</P>
<P>Hitherto Intreague, Subtilty, and Management
had been the Method in all the Steps which had
been taken to have introduc'd this Novelty in∣to
the Church; but these were all defeated by
this Proceeding; for the Assembly took away
the Power, and left them the Name, which, 'tis
plain, did not answer the End.</P>
<P>There remained no other Way then, but open
Violence; and here we find the Regent making
the first Invasion upon the Kirk, and leading
the Way to all the Assaults which have been
made upon her ever since.</P>
<P>The Bishop of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> dying, the Re∣gent
recommends, or rather appointed the
Chapter to choose one Mr. <HI>Adamson,</HI> his Chap∣lain,
to succeed the Bishop.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="87"/>
The Chapter deferred the Election till the
General Assembly, and acquainted them with
it: Mr. <HI>Adamson,</HI> who was present in the As∣sembly,
was hereupon ask'd if he would sub∣mit
to Trials—and accept the Office with those
Injunctions which the Church would prescribe—
He answered, the Regent had forbid him to ac∣cept
of the Office otherwise than as appointed
by Church and State.</P>
<P>I give this <HI>verbatim</HI> out of Bishop <HI>Spotswood;</HI>
because his Authority is least questioned by the
Advocates of this Cause<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 5. fol. 277. Imparted to them the War∣rant they had received: The Bishop owns it was a Command <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Chapter to chuse him.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>Upon this Answer, which shew'd a direct In∣vasion
of their Authority, the Assembly could
do no less than assert their Right, and therefore
<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <HI>Inhibited the Chapter to proceed.</HI></NOTE> rejected him—but the Regent<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ibid.</HI> Upon a new Charge given them, they convened and made Choice of him.</NOTE> com∣manded
the Chapter to elect him, and they did
so, in Defiance of the General Assembly.</P>
<P>The Assembly, justly provok'd at this, gave
a Commission to the Superintendent of<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Calderwood <HI>says, it was the Superintendent of</HI> Fi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, <HI>which is most likely, St.</HI> Andrews <HI>being in that Province.</HI></NOTE>
<HI>Louthian,</HI> and two other Ministers—to call him
before them, and prohibit him to exercise any
Jurisdiction, till he should be authorized thereto
by the General Assembly.</P>
<P>Here we see a Bishop suspended, the Roy∣al
Mandate disputed, and a Superinten∣dent
who, <HI>Spotswood,</HI> in another Place, says,
had Episcopal Power, yet receiving a Commis∣sion
<PB N="85" REF="88"/>
from the Assembly, together with other
Ministers, to suspend only; which, had he been
a Bishop, he might have exercis'd without a
Commission, if it had been in his own Bounds,
and could not if he had been a Bishop, out of
his Diocess, by any Commission.</P>
<P>Upon this Attack of the Church, the Assem∣bly
resolving to act with as much Temper and
Moderation as possible, consisting with their
Right and the just Authority they possest: And
in order to prevent any more Disputes of this
Kind, resolved, if possible, to fix upon a Form
of Church-Polity, and accordingly it was
drawn up and<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Spotswood, <HI>lib. 5. fol. 277. The Form of Church-Polity was presented to the Regent by Mr.</HI> Robert Pont, <HI>Mr.</HI> David Lindsay, <HI>and Mr.</HI> James Lawson.</NOTE> offered, in their Names, to
the Regent; but the Troubles which quickly
followed upon this in the State, put a Stop to
the settling it at this Time also, as it had done
several Times before<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol. 73, 74, 75, 77, 80. The Regent ever resisted the Work of the Polity, which was then in Hand, and pressed his own Injunctions and Conformity with</HI> England.</NOTE>. Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> gives
a long Account of the Conference of the Mini∣sters
in the <HI>West,</HI> with those appointed by the
Assembly, in order to fix this ecclesiastical Po∣lity,
to which I refer; the Thing not being
obtained, 'tis not to my Purpose to enter into
Particulars other than this, that the Presbyterial
Authority was clearly establish'd in it, and the
very Name as well as Office and Power of a
Bishop left out.</P>
<P>The Regent, who opposed them in all Things,
did so, underhand, in this; for it was evident
he push'd not at the introducing the Bishops on∣ly,
<PB N="86" REF="89"/>
but even at the Dissolution of the Assembly,
whose Authority was too great for him, and
made him uneasie.—However, the Form was
presented, as above, and he did not openly re∣ject
it; but started Objections, and appointed
Questions to be answered, and nam'd a Commit∣tee
of the Council to confer with them about
it.</P>
<P>But now a new Revolution of Affairs hap∣pened;
for Factions rising, among the Nobility,
against the Regent, and, as it was thought, he
being sensible of his being too weak for them,
was advised to stoop to the Juncture of Affairs,
quietly to concede his Authority, and demit that
Power which, it was manifest, he could not
keep.</P>
<P>The King was now almost Twelve Years old,
and tho' he was under Governours, yet the Fa∣ction
of Lords not agreeing who to repose the
Trust in, it was resolved to declare the King
<HI>MAJOR,</HI> and put the Government into his
own Hands. This also seemed the more ho∣nourable
for the Regent; for to have named
another after him, had been plainly to have told
the World he was turned out—but to resign
his Government into the King's own Hand, had
a much greater Appearance of Honour.</P>
<P>He did so: But as great Mens Fall seldom
stop with the Loss of their Preferments, so it
was with him; he past through various Trou∣bles,
till at last the Persecution of his Enemies
brought him to the Block.</P>
<P>The King was young, but began to be infor∣med
of Things, and as well from <HI>Morton</HI> at
first, as the rest of the Courtiers about him af∣terwards,
he received too early Prejudices a∣gainst
the Constitution of the Church, and in
<PB N="87" REF="90"/>
particular he took all Occasions to intrench upon
the Power of the Assembly.</P>
<P>The Debate was now wholly about Bishops, the
Assembly was for reducing their Power, which
was effectually done as before; they were now
for reducing the Name too, as a Thing which
they found furnished Matter of continual Di∣sturbance:
So in the Third Session of the As∣sembly
1577, it was ordained, <HI>That all Bishops
and others, bearing Ecclesiastical Function, be called
by their own Names, or Brethren only</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Hist fol. 82. That the said Act shall be ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ended to all Times to come, and till the Corruption of the State of Bishops be utterly removed out of the Church.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the Seventh Session of the same Assembly
they put a Stop to the Number, and ordered
that no Bishop be elected or admitted before
the next General Assembly; for bidding Ministers
and Chapters to elect, or any way proceed to
the Election of any Bishop, on Pain of Depriva∣tion.</P>
<P>In the Assembly at <HI>Sterling,</HI> in <HI>June</HI> 1578, they
made the said Law perpetual, and that all Bi∣shops
already elected, be required to submit
themselves to the General Assembly. And thus
that infant mongrel Episcopacy, <HI>so it was then
called,</HI> was voted out of the Church as a Nusance.</P>
<P>In the same Assembly they appointed a Com∣mittee
to wait upon the King with the Book of
Polity and a Supplication, which was done; and
they were received well enough by the King
with good Words and Promises of Kindness and
Countenance, and a certain Number named by
the Council to confer with them; tho' the King
himself secretly hated both their Persons and
<PB N="88" REF="91"/>
Measures, for which Reason nothing could be
obtained by that Conference.</P>
<P>The <HI>16th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> after, the Parliament met;
and the Commissioners, appointed by the Assem∣bly
to wait upon the Parliament, sollicited to
have the Book of Polity brought in there, and
confirmed; but the Nobility always put it off,
having, as afterwards appeared, no Kindness
for the Strictness and Severity of Presbyterian
Discipline.</P>
<P><HI>Morton</HI>'s Fall was not yet; for he still guid∣ed
the King, and instilled early Thoughts into
him in Prejudice of the Kirk, and in Favour of
the Bishops.</P>
<P>However the Church went on against them,
and the Assembly fell particularly upon two by
Name, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Adamson,</HI> whom <HI>Morton,</HI>
by his Letter, had made Bishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>John Boyd</HI> Bishop of <HI>Glasgow.</HI></P>
<P>But now a second Attempt was made upon the
Church, and that was by the King himself, or at
least in his Name. The Assembly, as has been
noted, having long struggled to obtain their
Book of Polity, they had been always, tho' not
absolutely denied to have it pass, yet so delay'd
and postponed, that it was easie to see the
Court was against them, and that it was not
design'd to be pass'd at all; nevertheless they went
on upon the Foot of the Scheme form'd, as what
was their just Right to demand, tho' they had
not Influence enough upon the Government to
obtain the Grant.</P>
<P>Being thus, as I have noted, proceeding up∣on
the Foot of the Polity <HI>as their Right,</HI> they
receive a Letter from the King, dated at <HI>Sterling</HI>
the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1579, inhibiting them to proceed
and commanding them to refer all the Matter<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="89" REF="92"/>
undecided in the Polity of the Kirk to the De∣cision
of the next Parliament<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Calderwood. <HI>fol.</HI> 86. [The Words in the Letter are] <HI>Forbearing any Proceedings at this Time that touch Matters here∣tofore not concluded by our Laws, or receiv'd into Practice; but whatsoever in the former Conferences, touching the Polity of the</HI> Kirk, <HI>was remitted to be decided by our Estates in Parliament, let it so rest without prejudging the same by any of your Conclusions at this Time.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The Assembly, notwithstanding this Letter,
went on; but with all the Caution and Respect
possible.</P>
<P>They examine the Articles referred, and pre∣sent
an Address to the King, desiring a farther
Conference upon the Affair of the Polity, and
followed this with a long Supplication, to move
the King to farther this Book of Polity.</P>
<P>While this was in Consideration, and 2 or 3
Years spent in the pressing the Polity on one
Hand, and putting it off on the other, in the
Year 1580; the General Assembly finding, as
they apprehended, that all they had yielded to
before as to the Word Bishop, was improved to
enlarge the Office and extend the Power of a
Bishop, they resolve to pull it up by the Roots,
and remove the very Name of it out of the
Church; and in order to this, they pass two Acts,
entirely abrogating the Office as unscriptural,
declaring it void and unlawful, as having no
Warrant or Foundation in the Word of God:
Which Acts, being very remarkable, are worth
perusing, and therefore, as abridg'd, are in the
Notes underneath<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><P>Forasmuch as the Office of a Bishop, as it is now used and commonly taken within this Realm, hath no sure Warrant, Authority, nor good Ground out of the Book of Scriptures; but is brought in by the Folly and Corruption of Mens Invention to the great Overthrow of the true Kirk of God: The whole Assembly, in one Voice, after Liberty given to all Men to reason in the Mat∣ter, none opposing themselves in defence of the said pretended Of∣fice, findeth and declareth the same pretended Office, used and termed as is abovesaid, unlawful in its self; as having neither Fundament, Ground, or Warrant in the Word of God; and Or∣daineth, that all such Persons as brook, or hereafter shall brook the said Office, be char'd <HI>simpliciter</HI> to demit, quit, and leave off the same, as an Office whereunto they are not called by God, and sic-like to desist and cease from preaching, Ministration of the Sacraments, or using any way the Office of Pastor, while they receive <HI>de novo</HI> Admission from the General Assembly, under the Pain of Excommunication, if they be found disobedient, to be pro∣nounced and executed against them.—</P>

<P>NOTE, the Bishop of <HI>Dumblain</HI> quietly conformed and submitted to this Act.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="93"/>
Putting all these Accounts together with as
much Impartiality as possible, 'tis manifest, and,
I think, out of Dispute, that the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
was in its original <HI>PRESBYTERIAN.</HI>
I have nothing to do here with the Difference or
the Disputes about which is the most scriptural,
Episcopacy <HI>or</HI> Presbytery, that Dispute is han∣dled
very strongly by its self; but <HI>the Reason I
have been so long on this Part, is to clear up the
Question which has been the Occasion of so much De∣bate
in the World, whether the first Reformation of</HI>
Scotland <HI>was</HI> Episcopal or Presbyterian.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="94"/>
The Court had indeed, from the latter End
of the Earl of <HI>Mar</HI>'s Administration, strug∣gled
hard with the Assembly to reserve its own
Power, and to have some Share in the Matter
independent of the Assembly, and at the Con∣vention
at <HI>Leith,</HI> they got Ground, as has been
hinted; but the Assembly vigorously opposed it,
and afterwards overthrew it all again, and by
<HI>these Acts</HI> entirely abolished the very Name of
a Bishop in the Church.</P>
<P>I come now to enter into a sad Series of Strife
between the Church and the Court upon this
very Subject; which continued with infinite
Struggles, <HI>Ʋps,</HI> and <HI>Downs,</HI> intervals of Liberty,
Storms of Tyranny, some horrid Scenes of
Ruin and Destruction, and perhaps some Ex∣tremes
on both Sides: All which harrass'd this
poor Kingdom till at last the Restoration of
King <HI>Charles</HI> II, brought the Church quite un∣der
Foot: And there begins her <HI>PERSECUTED
STATE. Of which by it self.</HI></P>
<P>The Court were, no question, very ill plea∣sed
with this Proceeding of the Assembly—but
they went still on with Steadiness: Several of
the Bishops submitted to this Order of the Ass∣embly,
and made their Submission, the Copies
of which, by after Times, their Successors be∣ing
ashamed so plain a Testimony of Fact should
appear, have been rac'd out of the Registers<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, fol. 92. There wanteth here in the Register Part of the Third Session, the whole Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Part of the Seventh riven out, as the rest of them were by the same sacrilegious Hands in the Year 1584; where the Submission of the Bishops of Glasgow, <HI>St.</HI> Andrews, <HI>and the</HI> Iles <HI>were set down, every one of whom accepted a particular Kirk,</HI> [and so from Bishops, as now meant, became Ministers only, or Bishops in a Scripture-Sense.]</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="95"/>
At length the King being advanced, by the
Death of the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> to the united
Crown of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> the Disputes rested for
some Time, the Court being taken up with the
Rejoicings of their new Acquisition, and with
the other Incidents of the new Government:
And by this Means the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> may
be said to have got some Ground, even at that
Time when the King, who was their avow'd
Enemy, was so encreas'd in Power as to be for∣midable
to them.</P>
<P>But the King was taken up with Mirth, and
the Court in Revels, I had almost said in De∣bauchery;
and not the King only, but the No∣bility
also, who were always the Hinderers of
the Reformation, were now absent, and not so
much concerned about what became of the
Church, when they had their private Fortunes
to make by the Favour of their Prince. This
Absence of the Court, I say, gave the Church
great Advantage, and the General Assembly con∣tinued
to assert and maintain their Establish∣ment
as Presbyterian in opposition to Episcopa∣cy,
notwithstanding all the Injunctions and In∣terruptions
which they met with from the
Court, and therefore this may very well be cal∣led
the growing State of the Kirk.</P>
<P>But to go back to what happened in the mean
Time. It was about the Year 1582, that the
King, by the ill Government of the Duke of
<HI>Lenox,</HI> Earl of <HI>Arran,</HI> &amp;c. who had him, as it
might be said, in Tutelage, had not only im∣posed
and intruded the so much abhorred Pre∣lacy
upon the Church, but had insulted the
Church in their Discipline and Government on
many Occasions, too long to relate; as particu∣larly
in the Affair of <HI>Montgomery,</HI> and the Tu∣mult
<PB N="93" REF="96"/>
in <HI>Glasgow,</HI> where, in defence of a Man ex∣communicated
for notorious Scandal, they mob∣bed
the Presbytery, beat and very ill treated
Mr. <HI>John Howison</HI> the Moderator, and wounded
several of the Students of the College; nor was
it far from setting Fire to the College it self: It
was said, that some of the King's Guards were
employed upon this Riot, to encourage a Tu∣mult;
for that the common People could not
otherwise be brought to injure the Ministers
after such a Manner.</P>
<P>But the Kirk recovered all this, when a few
Weeks after happened that memorable Attempt
of the Noblemen against <HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Arran,</HI> cal∣led
the Rode of <HI>Ruthven,</HI> taking the King out
of their Hands, by Force, and carrying him to
<HI>Sterling.</HI> This, I say, was called the <HI>Rode</HI> of
<HI>Ruthven,</HI> of which we shall hear a great deal
more, and was put in Execution <HI>August</HI> 20, 1582,
as the King came back from the great annual
hunting in <HI>Athol.</HI></P>
<P>It is not to our Purpose to enter into the Hi∣story
or Causes of this Attempt: It is enough
to say, that the Power of these two Noblemen,
or at least their imprudent exercising of that
Power was become intollerable to the Nation,
and the rest of the Nobility and Gentry con∣cerned,
found no other way to deliver themselves
from it, but to set the King at Liberty to act
by better Council.</P>
<P>They presented a Declaration to the King of
their Reasons for this Conduct, and carrying his
Majesty to <HI>Sterling,</HI> they gave him full Liberty
of his Person and a free Exercise of his Govern∣ment,
only taking Care that the Administration
was entirely removed from the hated Hands of
<HI>Lenox</HI> and <HI>Arran.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="97"/>
The King, tho' he never forgave this Action,
and to his last resented it against the Kirk, as if
they had been the only Instruments, yet com∣plied
with the Time, and the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI>
being clapp'd up in <HI>Duplin</HI> Castle, and the Duke
of <HI>Lenox,</HI> charg'd by Proclamation, to depart
the Country, his Majesty consented that a Pro∣clamation
should be published, intimating that
he was i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Town of <HI>Perth,</HI> at full Liberty;
that he staid there of his own Choice for some
Time, and that he approved of all the Lords
had done as for his Interest and Service. At
the same Time a Proclamation was also publish∣ed
for restoring the Liberties of the Kirk, the
Freedom of their Assemblies and Judicatures,
and for encouraging the Ministers in Discharge
of their Duty.</P>
<P>Thus the Church got the Day of their Ad∣versaries,
and all Violences offered to their Judi∣catures,
the Laws made to restrain their Li∣berties
or abridge their Rights, were declared
to be unjust and illegal, and were laid to the
Charge of the said Duke of <HI>Lenox</HI> and Earl of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪</P>
<P><HI>Arran; SƲCH AS</HI> the Disposition of Bene∣fices
<HI>Pleno Jure,</HI> without the Examination of
the Persons, and Admission by the Kirk, making
the King and his Council Judges in Matters
meerly ecclesiastical; discharging or prohibiting
the General Assembly to proceed to Excommu∣nication;
annulling the Sentence of Excommu∣nication
when past; Prelacy obtruded upon them
contrary to the Principles of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
who had declared in the General Assembly,
that the same was unscriptural, devilish, and of<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
humane Invention, <HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this Declaration a General Assembly
was convened to meet at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the <HI>9th of
<PB N="95" REF="98"/>
October</HI> 1582, and this was perhaps the first As∣sembly,
even from the Reformation, in which
it might be said the Church had an uninterrupted
Liberty to exert her full Power in her own E∣stablishment.</P>
<P>At this Assembly the Laird of <HI>Paisly,</HI> in the
Name of the associated Lords, declared, that
the Dangers of the Ecclesiastical Constitution,
and of Religion it self, as well as the Danger
of the King's Person and of the Civil Govern∣ment,
were the principal Causes of their late
Undertaking, and they desired the Concurrence
of the Assembly, as well in recognizing the
Necessity of what had been done, as in concert∣ing
what was yet to be done for the establish∣ing
and securing both the Church and State.</P>
<P>The Assembly unanimously voted (every Mem∣ber
being severally asked) the Reality of the
Dangers attending the Reformation and the
Church. The King, upon the Assembly's sending
some of their Body to him, readily declared,
that not only his own Person, but Religion it
self was in Peril, and that such Measures had
been entered into as must necessarily have over∣turn'd
the Reformation; that he esteem'd his
own Safety and the Safety of Religion to be in∣separable,
and exhorted the Assembly to do their
Duty to remove the Dangers that threatned
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth him and them.</P>
<P>This occasioned that famous Act of the
Assembly, wherein the Reformation is recog∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ized,
and the pursuing it recommended earn∣stly
as well to Ministers as People; all the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inisters are exhorted to set forth the Dangers
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the Church, the King, and the Common∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ealth
to their Flocks, in the most pressing
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anner, urging all who love and tender the
<PB N="96" REF="99"/>
Glory of God, the prosperous State of the King
and Common-wealth, to concur with them in
their Endeavour to their full Deliverance.</P>
<P>After this the Assembly proceeded with Vi∣gour
to exert themselves: They erected Pres∣byteries
and Church-Judicatures in such Parts
where there were none before, as in the North∣ern
Provinces of <HI>Sutherland, Caithness, Ross,
Murray, Aberdeen,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Then they empowered the Presbyteries to sum∣mon
before them the Bishops, and to cause them
to answer to the said Presbyteries for such
Offences as they should be accused of: The
Crimes the said Bishops were thus accused of
were such as these:</P>
<Q><P>Not Preaching, and administring the Sacra∣ments,
as is the Duty of a Gospel-Minister.</P>
<P>Neglect in Discipline.</P>
<P>Error in Doctrine.</P>
<P>Associating themselves with excommunica∣ted
Persons.</P>
<P>Wasting of the Patrimony of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Letting Leases of Land against the Prohibi∣tions
of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Collating to Benefices against the Tenor of
the Acts of the Kirk.</P>
<P>Scandal in Life and Conversation.</P></Q>
<P>And many other Things, not then articled,
which were left to the Examination of Wit∣nesses.
And the Presbyteries were farther em∣powered
to hear, try, acquit, and condemn, as
the Matters of Fact should appear to them.</P>
<P>The Time was now come when the Autho∣rity
of the Church had its full Establishment▪
The Convention of Estates, which was the<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="97" REF="100"/>
called, and which met at <HI>Perth,</HI> gave Room to
the Assembly to lay all their Grievances before
them, which was done in 22 Articles, and
their Demands of particular Redress for Wrong
and Wreck, <HI>as it was called,</HI> in 11 Articles
more.</P>
<P>The Bishops were now deposed, and many
of them submitted to become Pastors of private
Parish-Churches.</P>
<P>The Laird of <HI>Minto,</HI> who, at the Head of a
Mob, had insulted the Moderator of the Pres∣bytery
of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> submitted himself to the Ass∣embly,
and begg'd Pardon.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Robert Montgomery,</HI> whose Case had raised
such Disputes between the King and the Church;
the Church excommunicating him, and the
King restoring him by Proclamation; came in
and submitted, offering to undergo the Injuncti∣ons
of the Presbytery of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> and desiring
to be received into the Bosm of the Church.</P>
<P>And thus stood the Affairs of the Church at the
Beginning of the Year 1583, but it continued
but for a short While; for the King, impatient
of the good Government of the Lords, and in∣wardly
hating the Church, contriv'd to make his
Escape from <HI>Falkland,</HI> which, by the Assistance
of another Faction among the Nobility, he effect∣ed
the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1583, taking Refuge in the
Castle of St. <HI>Andrews:</HI> Thither repair'd imme∣diately
all those among the Nobility who were
privy to the Design; and thus they laid the
Foundation of an entire Change of Measures and
Persons in his Administration.</P>
<P>As in the State, so in the Church, all
Things tended to Change; saving only that the
Assembly, maintaining their Principles, stood
their Ground against the Court with a Con∣stancy
<PB N="98" REF="101"/>
of Zeal which could never be subdu∣ed.</P>
<P>However, the Bishops immediately got foot∣ing
by <HI>this Turn</HI> of the Court, and the Bi∣shop
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> being in the Castle there,
immediately reassumed his Office and Character,
presuming one the King's Protection, as openly
as if he had been placed in it by a legal Au∣thority,
even the King himself not yet decla∣ring
his Consent to his Attempt.</P>
<P>During these Transactions, the General As∣sembly
conven'd at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> (viz.) the <HI>20th</HI>
of <HI>October;</HI> nor did they slack their Hands in
their Proceedings against the Bishops, notwith∣standing
the King appeared now openly of the
Prelatick Party; for they call'd for the Report
of their Commissioners, appointed by the for∣mer
Assembly, to proceed against four Delin∣quent
Bishops, <HI>viz.</HI> the Archbishop of St. <HI>An∣drews,</HI>
the Bishops of the <HI>Isles, Dunkeld,</HI> and
<HI>Dumblain.</HI></P>
<P>The Archbishop had been summoned by the
Synod of <HI>Fife, apud acta,</HI> to appear at this As∣sembly,
which, he now thinking himself too
high to submit to, declined to do; so they pro∣ceeded
against him as in Contempt; and the
Process against his Woman Counsellor <HI>Alison
Pearsone,</HI> as a Witch, was also brought before
the Assembly, and a Committee was a appoint∣ed
to examine Witnesses against them both.</P>
<P>They also resolved now to make a Represen∣tation
of their Grievances, and of the State of
the Church and Kingdom, and lay the same
before the King himself in Discharge of them∣selves:
This some of the Ministers prest with
the more Earnestness, prophetically suggesting
that a Cloud of Darkness and Persecution was
<PB N="99" REF="102"/>
coming upon them, and would break over their
Heads in a violent and furious Storm, as well
from the Prelates as from the King himself.
The Heads of this Representation are at large
to be seen in the Histories of those Times. Ha∣ving
drawn out their<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol.</HI> 142.</NOTE> Grievances, some of
which pointed directly at the King as a Fa∣vourer
of the Enemies of God, as well Popish
as prelatick; they sent Ten Commissioners
with it to the King then at <HI>Sterling:</HI> They were
very coldly received, and told, that the King
advised the Assembly to keep within the Bounds
of their proper Business: The Commissioners
were sent back again to desire a more particu∣lar
Answer; but were told they had been fully
answered already.</P>
<P>At this Time two of the most bold and zeal∣ous
Members of the Assembly died, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr.
<HI>Alexander Arbuthnot,</HI> Principal of the College at
<HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Thomas Smeton,</HI> Principal of
the College at <HI>Glasgow.</HI> By the Loss of these
two great Men their Hands were extremely
weakened in the Struggles they were quickly
to meet with.</P>
<P>However, during the Sitting of this Assembly
they abated nothing of what they thought their
Duty: They prosecuted the Archbishop to such
a Hight, that he was obliged to feign an Em∣bassy
into <HI>England</HI> upon publick Affairs, <HI>tho'
others said he was worse employed,</HI> and fearing a
Sentence of Deposition, he obtained from the
King to be freed from Censure during his Ab∣sence.
It was said, that during this Journey
into <HI>England,</HI> he concerted with some of the
<PB N="100" REF="103"/>
Episcopal Clergy there, those wicked Measures
by which he afterward oppressed the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in the End overthrew it for a
Time.</P>
<P>That famous Supporter of the Church's
Cause, Mr. <HI>John Durie,</HI> was one of the first that
felt the Effects of the new Change, being com∣manded
by the King to depart from <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and remain at <HI>Montrose,</HI> which he submitted
to; but both the Town-Council and the Kirk-Session of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> gave him noble Testimo∣nials
both of his Life and Doctrine; which was
more to his Honour than all the Reproach his
Enemies laid upon him could overballance.</P>
<P>The persecuting the Ministers was the first
Work the new Establishment began with, be∣fore
they fell upon the Church it self; and even
in their dealing with the Ministers they acted
cautiously, and strove to begin with such Things
as they called legal Prosecutions for pretended
Offences: Afterwards they grew bolder, and
fell upon them in a grosser Manner.</P>
<P>In these pretended legal Prosecutions Mr. <HI>An∣drew
Melvin</HI>'s Case was the most famous Ex∣ample:
he was summoned before the Council,
where he was questioned for offensive Words
spoken in the Pulpit, on a Fast-Day, reflecting
on the King and his Administration, saying,
<HI>That the King was unlawfully promoted to the Crown,
with other seditious Words.</HI> The University, re∣solving to assert
their Privileges, sent two of
their Body with a Testimonial in his Behalf,
sign'd by 30 of their principal Men, as well
Masters as Students, and demanded that he
should be censured only by the University; the
Presbyteries of the Bounds sent Commissioners
to protest against the Proceedings as against the
<PB N="101" REF="104"/>
Liberties of the Church, and Mr. <HI>Melvin</HI> himself
declin'd the Jurisdiction of the Council in his
Case, in a long Declaration, which is to be seen
at large in Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s History, <HI>fol.</HI> 144,
145. But all these were rejected by the Coun∣cil.
In this Declaration he both positively de∣nied
the Words, solemnly and before God, pro∣testing
that he never spoke them, accused the
Informer of Malice and declared Prejudice, and
justified what he had really said to be accord∣ing
to God's Word and his own Duty: Upon
giving in this Declaration, he retired into <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
having Notice that he was to be confi∣ned
in <HI>Blackness</HI> Castle. After his Retreat he
was publickly praised, and pray'd for in the
Pulpit by the Ministers in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> which, as
the History of those Times expresses it, <HI>pleased</HI>
the People and <HI>galled</HI> the Court.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Land was full of Trou∣bles,
the Lords of <HI>Angus</HI> and <HI>Mar</HI> surprized
the Castle of <HI>Sterling;</HI> but their great Friend
<HI>Gowry</HI> being taken, and others secur'd, and they
being not strong enough to defend themselves
against the young King, who came against them
with a great Army, they flsed into <HI>England:</HI>
The Castle was surrendered, the Captain and
Three others, who surrendered it, were hanged:
This Attempt weakened the Hands of the
Church and their Friends, making their Enemies
not only more strong, but also more furious
than they were before. The General Assembly
was appointed to be held at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the
<HI>24th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1584, where the Number of
Ministers, who durst appear, were but very
few: The Commissioner whom the King sent to
them, being their declar'd and enrag'd Enemy,
<PB N="102" REF="105"/>
his Name was <HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Halyards,</HI> at that
Time <HI>Justice Depute.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Graham</HI> used them after an unaccustom∣ed
Manner, exerting a Power which they allow∣ed
not to be the Right, even of the King him∣self:
He treated them in a rude and imperions
Manner also, with all possible Disrespect. First
he demanded of them, on Pain of Rebelli∣on
and Treason, to annul a former Act of As∣sembly,
approving the <HI>Rode</HI> of <HI>Ruthven,</HI> and by
a new Act to condemn it. At the same Time
he entered into a Treaty with the Provost and
Bailies of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> to imprison those Mini∣sters
that should not comply. But the Mini∣sters
got Notice of it, and being resolved not
to comply, they silently declined the Assembly,
and dropt out of Town, one by one, leaving
the Commissioner to sit by himself. He had,
it seems, private Instructions to seize upon Four
of the leading Ministers, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>James Law∣sone,
David Lyndsey, Patrick Galloway,</HI> and <HI>An∣drew Hay.</HI>
The Three first appeared in the
Assembly, but he being willing to snap them
all at once, waited for the Fourth till those
that were there got Notice, and escaped, and
so he mist them all; for which he was very
much laughed at. The few Ministers that re∣main'd
refused to act, giving for Answer, that
they were too few to constitute an Assembly;
so the Commissioner retired.</P>
<P>Note; at this Assembly, the Court influencing
the Nobility, the Barons and Gentlemen, who,
as ruling Elders, were used to be sent up from
the Provinces, and were allowed to sit and vote
with them, were forbid by the Court coming
to the Assembly.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="106"/>
The Four Ministers abovenamed were sought
after, high and low, to be apprehended, and
would have been put to Death, especially Mr.
<HI>Patrick Galloway;</HI> but they made their Escape
for that Time, as did also many other∣Ministers,
such as Mr. <HI>John Davison,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Car∣michael,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Andrew Polwart,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>Now was the Court resolved, in Conjunction
with the Bishops, to ruin and overthrow the
Church; and to this End, the Negotiations of the
Archbishop in <HI>England</HI> having succeeded so far
as to have all possible Concurrence from thence;
to finish it the King called a Parliament: In this
Parliament Matters were managed so under∣hand
by the Court, that it seemed rather a
private Council, than a Parliament. The Lords
of the Articles, which were a Committee so
called whose Work it was to prepare Busi∣ness
for the Cognizance of the House, were
sworn to Secrecy, and when the House sat the
Doors were lock'd up.</P>
<P>However, the Ministers got Intelligence of
what was doing. <HI>Calderwood</HI> in his Account of
this Part says, one of the Lords of the Articles
betrayed them, <HI>fol.</HI> 155. Be that as it will, a
Letter was privately sent to the Ministers in <HI>E∣dinburgh,</HI>
from an unknown Hand, assuring them
that the whole Business of that Parliament was
to destroy the Church, and bid them take speedy
Care about it. The Ministers knew not what
to do, but they deputed Mr. <HI>David Lindsey,</HI> Mi∣nister
of <HI>Leith,</HI> who was thought to be a Man
acceptable to the King, to represent their Case,
and to pray, in the humblest Manner, that an
Assembly might be called and heard in Parlia∣ment,
before any Thing was done to the Pre∣judice
of the Church. But instead of hearing this,
<PB N="104" REF="107"/>
the King caused Mr. <HI>Lindsey</HI> to be apprehend∣ed,
as he was going into the Palace, and car∣ried
away to <HI>Blackness-Castle,</HI> without permitting
him to deliver his Message: They sent other
Messengers, to make Protest in open Parliament,
but to no purpose; they could not get in. How∣ever,
two Ministers, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Robert Pont,</HI>
and Mr. <HI>Balcanquell,</HI> by their private Interest,
did get in, and did make a Protest against th
Proceedings.</P>
<P>Not content with this Proceeding, the King
and Council sent an Order to the Magistrates of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> that in Case any Minister did, in th
Pulpit, offer to speak any Thing against the
Proceedings of the Parliament, they should in∣stantly
pull them down from the Pulpit, and
commit them to Prison; so the Acts were past
to destroy the Church, and to erect the Episcopal
Hierarchy in its Room, and were proclaimed at
the Market-Cross of <HI>Edinburgh:</HI> The said Mr.
<HI>Pont</HI> and Mr. <HI>Balcanquell</HI> taking Instruments of
their Protest against it in the Name and Behalf
of the Church. But the said Ministers had no
sooner done so, but they were oblig'd to fly,
as did also Mr. <HI>James Lawsone,</HI> and several o∣thers.</P>
<P>These Acts of Parliament, for protesting a∣gainst
which the Ministers were thus used, a∣mounted
to neither more nor less than an Ac∣knowledgment
of the King's Supremacy, and
the Government of the Church by Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>It has been an Observation, which, I believe,
will hold good throughout all Ages of the
Church since the Reformation, that no sooner
was Episcopacy, upon any Occasion, set up in
the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but it began always to
persecute the Presbyterian Church. And this
<PB N="105" REF="108"/>
was the Case here; for soon after this the Par∣liament
sat again, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1584,
when an Act was made, enjoining all Ministers,
Masters of Colleges, and other Ecclesiastick Per∣sons,
to appear within 40 Days, and subscribe
the new Constitution of the Church, as it was
then called, and submit to their Diocesan, on
Pain of losing their Stipends.</P>
<P>Some Ministers refused this, and were sore∣ly
persecuted by the Council; but they conti∣nued
to declare against it as illegal, and being
questioned by the Council, how they durst op∣pose
or condemn an Act of Parliament, they an∣fwered
boldly, that they would condemn every
Thing that was repugnant to the Word of
God. Mr. <HI>Graig,</HI> one of these Ministers, was
greatly insulted by the Earl of <HI>Arran;</HI> but he an∣swered
him in a Kind of prophetick Rage, That
God should, in a short Time, cast him from his
Horse, meaning his Pride and Power, and humble
him for mocking the Servants of God. This came
<HI>literally</HI> to pass in a few Years after, the Earl
being unhorst by <HI>Douglas</HI> of <HI>Parkhead,</HI> and kill∣ed.</P>
<P>On this Occasion Mr. <HI>Craig</HI> was depriv'd, and
forbid to preach in <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and the Archbi∣shop
went up into his Pulpit to preach, by Or∣der
of the King and Council; but when the
People saw him come up into the Pulpit, in∣stead
of their own Minister, they universally
rose up and went out of the Church, the <HI>Court-Party</HI>
only staying in the Place. The Copy of
the Subscription required of the Ministers was
as follows.</P>
<P>We the Benefic'd-Men, Ministers, and Masters
of Schools and Colleges, testifie and promise by
<PB N="106" REF="109"/>
these our Hand-Writs, our dutiful and humble Sub∣mission
to our Sovereign Lord the King's Majesty,
and to obey, with all Humility, his Highness Act of
his late <HI>Parliament,</HI> holden at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>22d</HI>
Day of <HI>May</HI> 1584. And that according to the same
we shall shew our Obedience to our Ordinair, <HI>Bishop,</HI>
or COMMISSIONER appointed by his <HI>Ma∣jesty</HI>
to have the Exercise of spiritual Jurisdiction
in our DIOCESS. And in Case of our Diso∣bedience
in these Premisses, to be content that our
Benefices, Livings, and Stipends VAIK ipso fa∣cto,
and that qualified and obedient Persons be pro∣vided
in our Room, as if we were naturally dead.
<HI>Witness,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Ministers that refused to subscribe this
Paper, went into voluntary Banishment and re∣mained
in <HI>England,</HI> but mostly about <HI>Berwick,</HI>
where the banished Lords also resided; but they
had their Preaching even there but in private;
for such was the Correspondence between the E∣piscopal<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>People in <HI>Scotland</HI> and the Church of
<HI>England,</HI> that albeit the Queen of <HI>England</HI> per∣mitted
the banished Lords and Ministers of
<HI>Scotland</HI> to harbour in <HI>England,</HI> yet would she
not admit them to have Preaching in publick,
as not being consonant to the Worship of the
Church in <HI>England.</HI> Great Instance was made
to Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> to deliver up those Noble∣men
and fugitive Ministers, which never the less
she would never do; but she yielded at last to
oblige them to reside farther from the Borders▪</P>
<P>During these Oppressions, many Ministers of
the Kirk complied with and subscrib'd the Form
above, with some Alterations. Mr. <HI>Andrew
Simson,</HI> Minister of <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> subscribed thus:</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="110"/>
I MASTER ANDREW SIMPSON,
Minister of <HI>Dalkeith,</HI> swear by the Name of the
great God, that I shall not preach any Heresie or se∣ditious
Doctrine, nor shall privately or publickly stir
up the <HI>King's Majesty's</HI> Subjects to any Rebellion,
and shall obey all his Laws and Acts of Parliament,
so far as they agree with the Word of God.</P>
<P>Others absolutely refused, and Mr. <HI>Dalgliesh,</HI>
Minister of the <HI>West Kirk</HI> at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was one; in∣somuch
that a Scaffold was erected for his Executi∣ons
which, however, could not bring him off, nei∣ther
would he ever comply. At last the Court was
fain to publish an Explanation of it, softening
the Meaning. But tho' this Explanation, which
was penn'd by the Archbishop, was accepted
with much Applause in <HI>England,</HI> and the <HI>Scots</HI>
Ministers were censur'd then for rejecting it, yet it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in'd but very little upon the Ministers in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and serv'd only to shew the Weakness of those
Acts which they took so much Pains to explain.
In this Condition stood the Church for some
Years, struggling with daily Innovations, the
King their open and declared Enemy, and on∣ly
supported by the Integrity of her Ministers
and People: The great Subject upon which the
Ministers were persecuted was, the subscribing
the Obligation mentioned; all such as refused
were displac'd, and turn'd out; and this con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inued<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
to the Year 1587, when it pleased
God to give a new Turn to the Affairs of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> of which the following brief Account
will inform us.</P>
<P>The banished Lords, who, as has been said,
the Queen of <HI>England</HI> had been unkind to, were
one <HI>South;</HI> but an Accident happen'd upon
<PB N="108" REF="111"/>
the Borders, which brought them back; for
on the <HI>26th</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1585, at a Meeting of the
Wardens of the Borders on either Side, to ad∣just
some Disputes, instead of an Agreement,
they fell to Blows, and the young Lord <HI>Russel,</HI>
eldest Son to the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> with some
other <HI>English</HI> Men were slain by the Laird of
<HI>Fernihurst:</HI> Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> resenting this as a
high Affront, shewed her Resolution to re∣venge it;
and immediately, as a Beginning, she
smiles upon the Refugee-Lords, and encourages
them with Money and Promises of Assistance
to return into their Country by a strong Hand:
The Confusions which then happen'd at Court,
gave them a very good Opportunity, and se∣veral
discontented Lords, and some under Pro∣secutions
for differing Causes, not Religion,
yet all joined with these to recover their Liber∣ty
by Force, and to lay hold of this Occasion,
as offered by Heaven for their Return.</P>
<P>About the Beginning of <HI>October,</HI> the banish∣ed
Lords from abroad, and the discontented
Lords at home, meet at <HI>Jedburgh;</HI> and muster∣ing
their Forces found they had between Nine
and Ten Thousand Men well appointed: The
King and the Earl of <HI>Arran</HI> lay at <HI>Sterling,</HI>
with few Forces; the Lords advance to <HI>Falkirk,</HI>
and the next Day to <HI>Sterling:</HI> The Earl of <HI>Ar∣ran,</HI>
the Archbishop, and all the wicked Crew
fly over <HI>Forth,</HI> pursued faster by their own
Guilt, than by their Enemies; the Castle sur∣rendred
the <HI>4th</HI> of <HI>November;</HI> and the Lords
present themselves to the King.</P>
<P>And now the hypocritical Face being <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
outermost, they are received with Kindness
and Favour, tho' nothing less intended or de∣sired;
the Episcopal Crew fly while none pursues,
<PB N="109" REF="112"/>
the King owns he has been abused, pro∣mises
to be directed by their Counsel, and pre∣tends
to acknowledge the good Hand of God in
ringing Things to their due Course again, and
restoring them, who were his faithful Friends,
without Bloodshed.</P>
<P>The Scene being thus chang'd, Episcopacy
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anish'd in a Moment, as a Vapour before the
Sun; a Parliament was summoned, and the
Church had its Assembly again, which had been
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uppress'd for near Three Years.</P>
<P>This Assembly was appointed for the <HI>23d</HI> of
<HI>November</HI> 1587, and the Place named was <HI>Dum∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ermling,</HI>
the Plague reigning both at <HI>Edinburgh</HI>
and <HI>Sterling;</HI> but when the Ministers came thi∣ther,
they found the Ports of the Town shut
against them, by Order of the Laird of <HI>Pit∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erren;</HI>
so they adjourn'd to <HI>Linlithgow.</HI></P>
<P>But the King, who mortally hated the Kirk,
began now to work another way; for as he
could not recover the Party that was now ba∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ished
and fled; he fell to flattering the return∣ed
Lords, and by smooth Words, Entreaties,
Promises, Bribes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to bring them off from
their Engagements with the Ministers; so that
when the Assembly applyed to the King to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>brogate the Acts of Parliament, which were
their present Grievance, the King flew out in
the greatest Rage imaginable, giving them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and scurrilous Language, and railing them
out of his Sight.</P>
<P>Having met with this Repulse, they applyed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the Lords, but were sorely abash'd when
they found them cold and backward; some pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osing
Delays, others declining to meddle with
at all, others promising fair, but doing no∣thing,
and all of them willing to put it off to
<PB N="110" REF="113"/>
another Occasion. But the Ministers besieging
the King with continually insisting upon Re∣dress,
he commanded them to exhibit what they
alledg'd against the Acts of Parliament i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Writing, this they did at large, with a Sup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
plication to the King to do them Right. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
which are at large in <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s History, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
192, 193.</P>
<P>The King makes a Declaration, in Answer
to this, explaining the Acts of Parliament, and
justifying them in all Points. And thus it seem∣ed
to be a Dispute between the Kirk and the
King; for this Declaration is said to be penn'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by the King himself. The King would gra<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
no more than this Declaration allow'd, so the
Kirk return'd a Supplication to the King, and
thus it stood for that Year. This Declaration
and Supplication are curious Pieces for those
to read who desire to be fully Masters of this
Dispute, and much has been said of the ex∣traordinary
Nicety and Subtilty of the Compo∣sition.
They are to be found at large in the
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>Hist. fol. 193, to</HI> 195.</NOTE> History of those Times.</P>
<P>As the Assembly was now revived, so were
the Provincial Synods; and as that of <HI>Fife</HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>specially
had been discontinued, because of their
having fallen upon the Archbishop of St. A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<PB N="112" REF="115"/>
said <HI>Patrick Adamsone,</HI> and ordains the said Sen∣tence
of Excommunication instantly to be put in
Execution in the Face of the Assembly, and by the
Mouth of Mr. <HI>Andrew Huntar,</HI> Minister of <HI>Carn∣bie,</HI>
declaring him to be one of those whom Christ
commandeth to be holden as an Heathen or Publi∣can
—Ordaining the said Sentence to be intimated
in all the Kirks, that none pretend Ignorance there∣of.</P>
<P>The Archbishop appealed, and excommuni∣cated
several of the Ministers; but he was an∣swered
by Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> at large, and this
is the Sentence which the Bishop begg'd, at his
Death, to be absolved from: These Things
held the World in Suspence till the next As∣sembly
met, which was in <HI>May</HI> 1585. This
was that famous Assembly, called, The <HI>Assembly
of Conference;</HI> wherein a Conference was ma∣naged
by Commissioners on both Sides, and an
Accommodation was proposed. The King in∣sisted
upon the Name of Bishop, the Assembly
upon the Power and Office. The Assembly
granted the Name, and the King gave up the
Power, and thus the Matter seem'd to be com∣promised
between them. And it is from this
Assembly, that, to this Day, the Episcopal Par∣ty
say, that the Presbyterians did acknowledge
Episcopacy; but if they look into the Particu∣lars
of the Bishop which they allowed, they
will find, that he was to be a Pastor of a Con∣gregation,
and that he was to be subject to the
Assembly, and that he came under several o∣ther
Circumstances, which will very ill support
that Assertion.</P>
<P>In this Assembly, at the King's Request, and
upon the Archbishop's Submission, they took
<PB N="113" REF="116"/>
off the Excommunication, pronounced at the
Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI> against the Archbishop of St.
<HI>Andrews,</HI> and absolv'd him.</P>
<P>But against this Absolution one of the Mi∣nisters,
<HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Huntar</HI> by Name, gave
in that memorable Protestation, which stands
upon Record in the Book of the Assembly, and to
which afterwards most of the rest of the Mi∣nisters
adhered; <HI>which I have added at the End
of this Part, No.</HI> A.</P>
<P>It was observed, that the King wrought
with this Assembly by much Policy and Cun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning;
He had, by Experience, found that rigid
Methods, Persecutions, and Prosecutions would
not answer, and that the Ministers became ra∣ther
the more <HI>CONSTANT,</HI> or <HI>obstinate,
as he called it,</HI> by such Methods; wherefore he
went other ways to work, and seeking by all
secret and underhand Dealings, to divide and
draw off, to please, wheedle, perswade, entreat,
and deceive; by these Methods he got many of
the Brethren to act a different Part from what
they would otherwise have done. This was e∣vident
in the Case of the Archbishop, where he
formally submitted, but secretly abhorr'd them;
the Church formally absolv'd him, and yet se∣cretly
believ'd him to be unreformed.</P>
<P>However it was, the Church, in all this Time,
kept upon its Feet, tho' in continual Broils
with the King; upon the Subject of Episcopacy,
and as well about the Authority as the Name
of a Bishop. There were Two Assemblies in
the Year 1587, but the latter was convened
extraordinary, because of the growing Danger
of Popery; the Island being under great Appre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ensions,
at that Time, from the threatn'd Inva∣tion
of the <HI>Spanish Armada;</HI> and during which
<PB N="114" REF="117"/>
the Disputes at home were somewhat abated;
and it was on this Occasion, that the Agree∣ment,
called the <HI>General Band,</HI> was subscribed
by the King, Council, and several Persons of
divers Estates through the whole Kingdom,
which, in short, was neither more or less than
what we now call an Association, and was done
against the Papists, in which are these Words:
“And for our farther hearty Union in this
Service, we are content, and consent, that
all and whatsoever our Feuds and Variances,
fallen, or that may fall out between us, be
within 40 Days hereafter, amicably referred
and submitted to Seven or Five indifferent
Friends, chosen by his Majesty, of our whole
Number; and by their Moderation and Ar∣bitriment
taken away and componed: And
finally, that we will neither directly or in∣directly,
separate or withdraw us from the
Union or Fellowship of one another; and as
we shall answer to God, upon our Consciences;
and to the World, upon our Truth and Ho∣nour,
and under Pain to be esteemed Tray∣tors
to God and his Majesty, and to have
lost all Honour, Credit, and Estimation in
Time coming.”</P>
<P>They were at this Time under Apprehensi∣ons,
as is said, of the <HI>Spanish</HI> Invasion, and the
next Assembly being on the <HI>6th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> appointed a solemn Fast upon that
Occasion. <HI>NOTE, the Assembly, not the King
appointed this Fast.</HI> And at the End of <HI>October,</HI> the
same Year, a solemn Fast was kept Three Sab∣baths
successively, a Communion celebrated,
and the whole concluded with giving Thanks
for the Defeat of the <HI>Spanish Armada</HI> by the
<HI>English. NOTE, all this was without the King.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="118"/>
Things now remain'd in a tolerable Quiet,
the Fears of Popish Powers were over by De∣feat
of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> the King intent upon his
Marriage with the Daughter of the King of
<HI>Denmark,</HI> went over Sea to <HI>Copenhagen.</HI> The
next General Assembly was at <HI>Edinburgh Au∣gust</HI>
4. 1590, and now the King and the Church
seem'd perfectly <HI>reconciled,</HI> and, which is more,
<HI>united.</HI> Of this Assembly I must record some∣thing,
the Truth of which is not to be doubt∣ed;
but the more it is certain, the greater
Brand of Infamy and Reproach will it leave
behind upon the Person, who, after this, acted
so contrary, in his Station, to what he appear'd
that Day.</P>
<P>The Eighth Session of this Assembly the
King came in Person into the Place where the
Ministers held their Meeting, and being seat∣ed
in a Chair of State, the Moderator Mr.
<HI>Patrick Galloway</HI> proposed Three Things to him,
<HI>viz.</HI> The Ratification of their Liberties, the
Purging the Land of Jesuits, Popish Seminaries,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Provision of Salaries or Stipends
in every Parish for the Ministers. <HI>For the first,</HI>
the King answered, That in every Parliament
their Liberties were ratified, and should still
be so. That he would, <HI>with Heart and good
Will,</HI> join to do the Second; and <HI>for Stipends,</HI>
he referred them to the Council, and ordered
them to name Commissioners to treat with the
Council about it: After some other Debates,
the King stood up, and taking off his Bonnet,
with his Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven,
<HI>but hypocritically, say the Writers of those Times,</HI>
he broke out, as it were, in an Extasie of
Praises and Thanksgiving to God, “(1) That
he was born into the World, at a Time when
<PB N="116" REF="119"/>
the Light of God's Word shone clearly forth,
eclips'd neither with the Mists of Ignorance, or
the false Lights of Superstition. (2.) He bles∣sed
God that had honoured him to <HI>be a King
over SƲCH A KIRK, the sincerest KIRK
in the World,</HI>” says the King, repeating it
Three Times: To strengthen this he flies out
upon other Protestants, <HI>The Church of</HI> GENE∣VA,
<HI>what are they?</HI> Says the King, <HI>they keep
PASCHE and YƲLE, what Authority
have they in God's Word,</HI> says the King, <HI>and
where is their Institution?</HI> As for our Neigh∣bour
Church in <HI>England, says this most sincere
and wise King, whom our</HI> English Church-Men,
<HI>after this, compared to</HI> Solomon <HI>for Wisdom,</HI>
“Their Service is <HI>an EVIL MASS SAID
IN</HI> ENGLISH, they want nothing of the
Mass but the Liftings: I charge you my good
People, <HI>turning himself to every Side of the Kirk,</HI>
Ministers, Doctors, Elders, Nobles, Barons,
and Gentlemen, to stand to your Purity, and
to exhort my People to do the same, <HI>AND
I,</HI> forsooth, so long as Life and Crown be
left to me, shall maintain the same against all
deadly.”</P>
<P>Had he been sincere in this, these Words
were to be recorded to his Honour, but we
shall soon see his Majesty acting quite another
Part. However, for the present, the Words,
and above all, the affectionate Manner with
which they were spoken, and their coming from
the Mouth of their King, unthought of, un∣expected
by the Auditory, so affected the Mini∣sters
that many burst out into Tears for Joy
and Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> relating this Passage says
<HI>There was nothing heard for a Quarter of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="117" REF="120"/>
Hour</HI> in the Assembly, <HI>but praising God,</HI> and
praying for the King<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood'<HI>S Hist. of the Church of</HI> Scotland, <HI>fol.</HI> 256</NOTE>.</P>
<P>While the King continued in this Mood, the
Church gat Ground, and went on in a truly
growing Condition; her Judicatures were ac∣knowledg'd,
her Authority established, and her
Episcopal Enemies truckled. And I cannot give
a better Instance to confirm this last, than the
Submission and Recantation of the Archbishop
of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the most implacable and inve∣terate
Enemy of the Church, who had mort∣gaged
Faith and Conscience for the Cause of
Episcopacy, and had made Shipwrack of <HI>BOTH,</HI>
as will appear under his Hand. This Recan∣tation
being so eminent, and the Character of
the Man so well known, it is necessary to re∣cord
it with the History of the Times; because
it is a standing Monument of the Subjection
of the Episcopal Hierarchy to the presbyterial
Institution.</P>
<P>Nor can the Friends of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
desire two greater Testimonies to her di∣vine
Institution, than these from the Mouths of
her two greatest Opposers, <HI>viz.</HI> the King and
the Archbishop. The Acknowledgment of E∣nemies
has a double Force in it: 'Tis a Con∣fession
that comes generally extorted by the
Force of Truth, and the Influence of Consci∣ence,
as <HI>Julian</HI> the Apostate acknowledg'd
Christ, when the poisoned Dart stuck in his
Flesh. If we may believe the History of that
Time, the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had not two
more such powerful, and perhaps implacable
Enemies in that Age, nay, scarcely before o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="118" REF="121"/>
since, as the King and the Archbishop, and both
of them are now brought to acknowledge the
Purity of her Doctrine, the Exactness of her
Discipline; <HI>the one</HI> to thank God for being born
under such a sincere and heavenly Institution;
<HI>the other,</HI> to cry God and the Church's Mercy
for his apostatizing from it, and desiring to
die in the Arms of that Church of which be∣fore
he had been so cruel a Persecutor.</P>
<P>But to go on with the Bishop's Story. He
had been excommunicated by the Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI>
as has been said; one of his Crimes was Mar∣rying
the Marquess of <HI>Huntly,</HI> without requiring
him to subscribe the Confession of Faith, and
after the Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> had inhibited
any Minister to do it. For this he was pursu∣ed
at Law, and stood out to a <HI>Horning,</HI> as it is
there called, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to a Contempt or Execution;
and the King beginning to be weary of the Con∣test,
and willing, perhaps, at that Time to
please the Assembly, abandon'd him, and depri∣ved
him of the Revenue of the Bishoprick;
whether these Misfortunes, or the Reproaches
of his own Conscience, brought him down, I
will not determine, Charity bids us judge the
best. But he fell into a languishing and grie∣vous
Sickness: In this Condition he acknow∣ledges
his Offence against God and against the
Ministers, and sent to them to let them know it,
and to offer himself to make publick Confession
in the Pulpit, to give Satisfaction to all who
had been offended at his Behaviour. He sent
also to the Presbytery of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> desiring
they would give him Absolution, and receive
him again into Communion, and into the Fellow∣ship
with the Saints.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="122"/>
The Ministers were doubtful of him for a
long Time, they knew not the just Reasons,
however were loth to resist the Work of Re∣pentance,
if begun in Sincerity, and were in∣clin'd
to receive him, upon his giving Satisfa∣ction
by a publick Acknowledgment, as he pro∣posed;
but it soon appeared there was no
Room for it, his Sickness being violent and
dangerous: So they directed Two of their Bo∣dy
to go to him, and enquire of his Circum∣stances,
and make their Report. These were
Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> and Mr. <HI>Andrew Moncrief.</HI>
Assoon as the Bishop saw them enter his Room,
he pull'd off his Cap, and raising himself he
said, calling them by their Names, <HI>Forgive me,
forgive me, for God's Sake; for I have grievously
offended you</HI> in particular. They replied, that
they forgave him, with all their Heart, and
gave him their Hands thereupon; but began to
talk with him about his publick Sins, and to
exhort him to an unfeigned Repentance and
Amendment: This he received with great Af∣fection.
Then they proceeded to ask him if he
acknowledged the Validity of the Church's
Censure, and of the Excommunication he was
under. He told them <HI>YES, he acknowledg'd
it;</HI> and cried out, <HI>I pray ye loose me, loose me,
for Christ's Sake;</HI> and this he spoke with such
Earnestness, and with so many Tears, that they
could no longer doubt of his Sincerity, and ha∣ving comforted
him as well as they could, they
left him, and making their Report to the rest
of the Ministers, they met thereupon, and in
a solemn Manner <HI>absolved</HI> him, giving Thanks
to God who had been pleased to restore him
by Conviction and Repentance.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="123"/>
In <HI>April</HI> following, the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> meet∣ing
at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> the Bishop, <HI>(I call him so for
Distinction,</HI> they called him only Mr. <HI>Patrick A∣damson</HI>)
sent his Recantation in <HI>Latin;</HI> but the
Synod desired him to cause it to be drawn again
in <HI>English,</HI> and that he would make it as full
and clear as he could, and set his Hand to it,
which he did, and which is so worthy to be
read with the rest of the Story, that I could
not omit placing it in the Appendix to this Part,
<HI>No.</HI> B. There needs no more to be added of
the Bishop, save that about <HI>February,</HI> the Year
following, he died.</P>
<P>At this Time, if ever in this King's Reign,
the Church may be said to have been in its full
grown Strength; tho' it lasted not long; for
the King having, as was said, smil'd upon them,
caress'd and complimented them, <HI>tho' it soon ap∣peared
that it was no more,</HI> and their <HI>Arch-Ene∣my</HI>
having, as above, been reduced, they enjoy∣ed
a great Measure of Liberty and Authority:
Some few Things indeed were wanting, which
they set forth in their Petitions to the King and
Council in Nine Articles, which, tho' the King
did not immediately grant, yet they had kind
Answers, and so much was done as to make
them something easie. These Articles were,</P>
<Q><P>1. That all Laws that have been made for
the Weal of the true Kirk be ratified in
Parliament, and a new Act pass'd, establish∣ing
the Juridiction of the Kirk, and all
contrary Laws be abolished.</P>
<P>2. That the Kirk and Country be forthwith
purged from Popish Priests and Excommu∣nicates.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="124"/>
3. That a Law be made for repressing and
punishing the Abusers of the Sacraments.</P>
<P>4. That Ministers be maintained in the Pos∣session
of their <HI>Glebes, Manses,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>5. That Order be taken with the Author of
the Tumult at the Bridge of <HI>Dee.</HI></P>
<P>6. That Laws be made against violating the
Sabbath, and disturbing of Ministers in,
or going about the Execution of their Office.</P>
<P>7. <HI>Ibid.</HI> for repressing of Rapin and Murther,
that the Land may be purged of Blood.</P>
<P>8. That all Churches be forthwith planted
with Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and sufficient Stipends
allotted them.</P>
<P>9. That the Lands mortified to the Church, <HI>i.
e. given by deceased Persons in their Will,</HI>
with the Residue of the Tithes, which are
not employed for Minister's Stipends, be be∣stowed
on the Schools, Colleges, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As
also for Provision for the Poor, and re∣pairing the Kirks.</P></Q>
<P>All these Things the King had promised in
general Terms formerly to perform, but it
seems, the Ministers found not the Effect of
those Promises as they desired, and therefore
to the said Articles they added one, which the
King took not well at their Hands, <HI>viz.</HI> That,
in respect many Things had been promised, but
few performed, that now the Manner and
Time of performing should be expressed, and the
Execution of every Part agreed to. This Clause
seemed to reproach the King with evil treat∣ing
the Church, which he laid up in his Heart.</P>
<P>And now the Ministers thought the Time was
come, and an Opportunity presented when the
Polity of the Church might be confirm'd, and
<PB N="122" REF="125"/>
the Book of Discipline be recognized, and tho'
they foresaw that they would find it very diffi∣cult
to bring the King and his great Men to it,
so as to get it enacted in Parliament; they resol∣ved,
however, to give it all the Sanction they
could: The Commission of the General Assembly
therefore published an Act to “Order and appoint,
<HI>these are the very Words,</HI> that whosoever hath
born Office in the Ministry within this Kirk,
or presently bear, or hereafter shall bear Of∣fice
therein, do, and shall subscribe the Heads
of the Discipline of the Kirk within this
Realm, at length set down and allowed by
Act of the whole Assembly, in the Book of
Polity, registred in the Register of the Kirk,
and namely in the Heads controverted by the
Enemies of the Discipline of the reformed
Kirk in this Realm, and that they be charg'd
to do so by every particular Presbytery where
they be resident; and this, under Pain of Ex∣communication,
to be executed against the
Non-Subscribers, and the Presbyteries which
shall be negligent, shall receive publick Re∣buke
before the whole Assembly.”</P>
<P>It is observ'd, however, in<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood'<HI>s Hist. fol.</HI> 257.</NOTE> History, that
several Ministers in the Church shunned to
subscribe, and others that did subscribe, fell off
and accepted Bishopricks in the Innovations
which soon after were made by the King upon
the Church.</P>
<P>Nor was this all. But farther to prove what
I have observed of the Church's being arrived
to its full grown State, it is to be observed,
That the Parliament being now summoned to
<PB N="123" REF="126"/>
the <HI>29th</HI> of <HI>May</HI> 1692, the Church obtained,
in that Meeting, a compleat Ratification of
their Privileges and Government, and particu∣larly
of their General Assemblies, Synods, and
Presbyteries, which they had for many Years
before struggled with their Princes and Gover∣nours
for, but to no Purpose. The Tenor of
this valuable, and indeed unexpected Act of
Parliament is too long to insert at large; but
the principal enacting Clause is as follows.
The whole is to be found among the <HI>Scots</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Scots <HI>Acts of Parliament, Part</HI> 1. p. 607.</NOTE>
Acts of Parliament.</P>
<P>Our Sovereign Lord and Estates of Parliament

the said Kirk, and declareth it shall be lawful to

oftner <HI>pro re nata,</HI> as Occasion and Necessity shall

that the King's Majesty, or his Commissioner
with them, to be appointed by his Highness, be pre∣sent

thereof, nominate and appoint Time and

then, and in that Case, it shall be<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Leesome, <HI>i. e.</HI> Lawful.</NOTE> leesome to

General Assembly of the Kirk shall be keeped and
holden, as they have been in Vse to do thir Times by
past. And also ratifies and approves the Synodal,
or Provincial Assemblies, to be holden by the said
Kirk and Ministers twice ilk Year, as they have
been within every Province of this Realm, and also
the Presbyteries and particular Sessions appointed by
the said Kirk, with the whole Jurisdiction and Dis∣cipline
of the same Kirk.</P>
<Q>Agreed upon by his Majesty in Conference had
by his Highness with certain of the Ministers
convened to that Effect.</Q>
<P>It was at this Time that the Assembly took
that Freedom which they have been so often re∣proached
with since, and which, they said, King
<PB N="125" REF="128"/>
<HI>James</HI> never forgave them, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to admonish
the King. I shall give it impartially in the
Words of their own Historians: `The Assembly
directed their Brethren who were appoint∣ed
to present the Articles (<HI>that is, those above
mentioned</HI>) to go immediately to his Majesty,
and to admonish him gravely, in the Name
of the eternal God, to have Respect in Time
to the Estate of true Religion, to the many
Murthers and Oppressions, daily multiplied,
through Impunity and Lack of Justice, and to
discharge the Kingly Office in both, as he
will eschew the fearful Challenge of God,
and avert his Wrath off himself and the
whole Land, and that he might be the bet∣ter
informed, to lay down the Particulars to
him, and crave Answer.</P>
<P>It is true, it was a Freedom which Kings
have not been much acquainted with in this
Age; but the Ministers of that Age thought it
their Duty, and perhaps if Ministers had since
done their Duty, with the same Care and Con∣science,
tho' their Kings had been ill pleased,
they had done better for the Publick, and for
Religion also.</P>
<P>However this was done with dutiful Re∣spect,
and when the King complained of the
Freedom, they, for Vindication of their own Be∣haviour
to their Prince, caused the Assembly to
pass an Act, ordaining, that `No Minister with∣in
this Realm utter, from the Pulpit, any rash
or irreverent Speeches against his Majesty, or
his Council, or their Proceedings; but that
all their publick Admonitions proceed upon
just and necessary Causes, and sufficient War∣rant,
in all Fear, Love, and Reverence, under
Pain of deposing the Offenders. And this
<PB N="126" REF="129"/>
most effectually cleares them from the Charge
of being mutinous and rebllious, and of refu∣sing
to submit to lawful Authority.</P>
<P>It is worth noting, for the Observation of the
Curious, that this happy Parliament, wherein
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was thus established, and
her Rights of every Kind recognized, met <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that particular Day from which her Overthrow
was 72 Years after dated. I mean at the Re∣storation,
<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>29th</HI> of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>The Authority of the Church being in this
flourishing Estate, 'tis necessary to record, to
their eternal Praise, as no doubt it is in Hea∣ven
to their eternal Comfort, how the Ministers
made use of their Time, and how they applied
themselves to discharge the Duty which lay
upon them as a national Church. I shall sin∣gle
out one or two Examples.</P>
<P>1. They appointed a Visitation of all the
Presbyteries in the Kingdom, and that the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> may be a standing Example
to all the Protestant Churches in the World,
I shall give the very Words of the Act of the
Assembly, the Meaning and Design of this Vi∣sitation
as follows: “Forasmuch as the Visiters
of Presbyteries, universally throughout the
whole Realm, are thought a Thing very ne∣cessary,
and from diverse Assemblies Commis∣sion
hath been given for that Effect, a Ne∣cessity
yet remaining, which craveth the con∣tinuing of the
said Commission, the Assembly
hath given Commission to certain Brethren,
to visit, and try the Doctrine, Life, Conver∣sation,
Diligence, and Fidelity of the Pastors,
within the said Presbyteries: And siclike to
try, if there be any of the beneficed Number
within the famine, not making Residence, ha∣ving
<PB N="127" REF="130"/>
no reasonable Excuse: If there be any
that have dilapidate their Benefices, set Tacks
and made other Dispositions of the same,
without the Consent of the General Assembly;
any slanderous Person, unmeet to serve in the
Kirk of God, unable and unqualified to teach
and edifie: And with Advice of the Presbyte∣ry,
within the which the said Persons remain,
to proceed against them, according to the
Quality of the Offence, according to the Acts
of the Kirk.”</P>
<P>2. The Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> being met at St. <HI>An∣drews
September</HI> 25. 1593, and being informed
of the Threatnings, the Insolence, and the
growing Power of Papists and other Enemies
of the Truth, and how the Impunity in suffer∣ing
these Things to go unpunished, was a great
and a national Sin, moved with this and other
Signs of imminent Danger, made the following
Conclusion.</P>
<P>That the Pastors of every Congregation, being first
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>repared themselves, by Abstinence, Prayer, and
diligent Study, and Attendance upon their Charge,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ravel carefully by their Doctrine and good Example
to move and dispose the Hearts of their Flock to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nfeigned Repentance, calling for Mercy and Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ervation
at the Hands of God, that thus both
Pastor and People may be prepared against that
general and solemn Fast which the Synod thinketh
most needful to be published throughout the Realm.
The Causes whereof, beside the general Reasons for
Humiliation in Time past, are as follows.</P>
<P>The Causes which are here referred to were
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 289.</NOTE> summed up in many Particulars, referring
<PB N="128" REF="131"/>
chiefly to the Growth of Popery, Idolatry,
Prophaneness, and Immorality.</P>
<P>To this the said Assembly added the direct∣ing
some of their Members to the King “To
tell plainly to his Majesty, <HI>these be also their
own Words,</HI> that which all his true Subjects
think, touching his too much bearing with,
favouring and countenancing Papists and
Traytors, his Negligence in repressing Ido∣latry,
and establishing the Kingdom of Christ
within his Realm, and to declare freely to
his Majesty the Resolution of all his godly
and faithful Subjects, <HI>viz.</HI> That they are rea∣dy
to give their Lives, rather than to suffer
the same.”</P>
<P>This was plain dealing, and this was what
the Courtiers afterwards called disciplining of
the King. But the Synod stopt not here; for
they went on to excommunicate the Popish and
<HI>Spanishly</HI> affected Nobility, so they then called
them, as Persons “Who, by their Idolatry,
Hersie, Blasphemy, Apostacy, Perjury, and
professed Enmity to the Kirk and true Re∣ligion,
had, <HI>ipso, facto,</HI> cut themselves off from
Christ and his Church.” This Excommunica∣tion
by the Synod is registred at large in the
Acts of the Church, having been afterwards
approv'd by the Assembly. But the King took
great Distaste at it, and from hence forward be∣gan
to withdraw his Countenance, and Assi∣stance,
and Favour from the Church, as soon
appeared in the Consequences; for the Church
pursued the excommunicated Lords, the King
protected them: The Church desired the King
to give them no Access to his person, the
King openly received them at <HI>Jedburgh,</HI> and the
like.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="132"/>
Upon this a Meeting, or Convention of Mi∣nisters,
Commissioners of Buroughs, and Barons
met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and deputed some of their
Members to wait upon the King. The King
refused to admit them, and sent them Word
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> did not acknowledge their Convention, it
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eing without his Advice. They insisted upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Legality of their Meeting. At last <HI>the King
ielded</HI> and gave such Answers as he thought
it to their Advices, but with little Satisfaction,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd perhaps as little Sincerity. However, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xcommunicated Lords offered themselves to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ryal the King agreed to it, giving a
Commission for that Purpose to a certain Num∣ber
of the Peers and Gentlemen to try them:
Their Names were as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Earls
<HI>of Huntly, Angus, Errol,</HI> Laird of <HI>Auchindown,</HI>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Sir <HI>James Chisholme.</HI> But the King abo∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shed
the whole Process afterwards, and by
his own Royal Declaration absolved them all,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that upon Conditions not at all acceptable
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the General Assembly, who, being met at
Edinburgh <HI>May</HI> 7, 1594, ratified the Excom∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>unication
against the Lords, ordered it to be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ronounced in every Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
reputed a Committee of their Ministers to lay
Representation of the DANGERS OF
THE CHƲRCH, (mark it is an old Phrase)
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efore the King, and report his Answer. The
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epresentation was very long, and the King's
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nswer particular; but in short, the King pro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ised
to forefault the excommunicated Lords;
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat is, to <HI>outlaw</HI> them, and that the Parliament
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould meet according to the Time appointed:
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which was made good, and the excommuni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ted
Lords were declared guilty of High
reason, their Coats of Arms torn by the He∣rald,
<PB N="130" REF="133"/>
and their Estates forfeited: Upon which
they broke out into open Rebellion, and there∣upon
followed the Battle of <HI>Balrinness,</HI> between
the Earl of <HI>Argyle,</HI> and the Earls of <HI>Huntly</HI> and
<HI>Errol,</HI> wherein the excommunicated Lords were
defeated. But that is not to our Purpose.</P>
<P>Having often quoted Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Histo∣ry
to the Matters of Fact here related, I shall
now give the Words of that ancient and grave
Historian to the Subject I am upon, confirm∣ing
what I have said of the full grown State
of the Church; And I do it here, because that
State seem'd now to be at its Hight, and that
this was the Time from whence it began sen∣sible
to decline; for now the Church fell into
Difficulties and Strife, which eclips'd her<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Glory for many Years, from whence, however,
we shall see her quickly rising again with <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
double Splendor. Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s Observation<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
is this:</P>
<P>“This Year is a remarkable Year to the
Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> both for the Beginning, and
for the End of it. This Kirk was now come
to the greatest Purity that ever it attained
unto; so that her Beauty was admirable to
Foreign Kirks. But the Devil envying the
Happiness, and laudable Proceedings of the
Ministry, and Assemblies of the Kirk, stirred
up both Papists and Politicians to disturb her
Peace. The Papists perceived there was no
Rest for them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Authority
of the Kirk continued; the Politicians feared
that their Craft and Trade, which is to <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
indifferently all Men and Means to attain to
their own Ends, and to set themselves up
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>as it were, in the Throne of <HI>Christ,</HI> should be
undone. Whereas at her earnest Desire, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="131" REF="134"/>
Apostate Earls <HI>Angus, Huntly,</HI> and <HI>Errol</HI> were
forefaulted for an unnatural and treasonable
Conspiracy with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> and were ex∣pelled
out of the Country; and she was now
setting her self to reform whatsoever Abuses
and Corruptions were perceived in her Mem∣bers,
and against the Re-entry and Restaura∣ration
of the said Earls. But was forced, by
Craft and Policy of Politicians, and dissembled
Papists, to take her self to the Defence of her
own Liberties, and of that holy Discipline,
which was her Bulwark, and to desist from
farther Opposition to the Re-entry of the ex∣communicate
Earls. For some thorny Que∣stions,
in Points of Discipline, were devised,
whereby her Authority was in many Points
called in doubt. Ministers were called before
the Council, to give account of their Rebukes
in Sermons, and to underly their Censure.
The Ministers of the Kirk of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were
forced to lurk, and that Kirk, which was a
Watch-Tower, and shined as a Lamp to the
rest, was darkned, and no less Danger ap∣peared
to threaten the rest. In a Word, in
the End of this Year began a fearful Decay,
and Declining of this Kirk.”</P>
<P>To confirm this, we shall give a Summary,
and that a very brief one, of the Transactions
on the few Years next following, in which the
Ministers struggled with the Defections of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>imes, the refractory Disposition of their
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rince, and the growing Insolence of Courti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s
and Enemies, till they were crush'd, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rc'd to submit to the pleasure of him, who
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ought fit, at that Time, to bring them under
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Feet of their Enemies for a Season.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="135"/>
The next Assembly met the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>March</HI>
1596; the King himself came thither; It seems
it was to desire the Ministers to forward a
Loan of Money, which he had designed to pro∣po∣se
to the whole Kingdom, on the extraordi∣nary
Occasions which were then before him
The Ministers declined it, alledging, that the
forfeited Estates of the Rebels were to have
been applied to that Use, it being just that
those who had been the Occasion of his extra∣ordinary
Expence, should contribute to defray
the Charge of it.</P>
<P>The Ministers fell to complaining of his Con∣duct,
his personal Sins, and the Sins of those
in his Family, which it was his Duty to re∣strain.
The King answered, if there were a∣ny
gross Faults in him, or his House, he would
not decline the Judgment of the Assembly, pro∣vided
it was done privately. Old <HI>Andrew
Melvin</HI> answered bluntly, <HI>They could not justifie
private Rebuke for open Offences,</HI> and speaking to
the Moderator, charged him, as he would an∣swer
it to God, that he should now do his Du∣ty,
and speak to the King plainly and freely,
as was his Place to do. The King stood silent
a while, and then withdrew.</P>
<P>This Assembly was famous for Three Things.
<HI>First,</HI> for their Search into and Regulation of
their own Corruptions as Ministers, extending
to all the Ministers of the Church; which Re∣gulation
consists of Eight Heads, and are to be
seen in the Registers of the Church. And <HI>Se∣condly,</HI>
For that famous Humliation and so∣lemn
renewing of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> which was be∣gun
in the Assembly the <HI>30th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1596,
and was carried on through all the Ministers
of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And <HI>Thirdly,</HI> For their humble,
<PB N="133" REF="136"/>
but faithful Representation to the King of the
Sins, as well of his Person and Family, as of
this Council and Nobility, and the Remedies
thereof, which were exhibited in Five Arti∣cles,
and it must be own'd this was the last
Time he had the Blessing of a faithful Mini∣stry
to advise and exhort him; and this As∣sembly
being over, it was observed by many,
that the Church never had another like it, du∣ring
that King's Reign, and it is at this Peri∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d
that Mr. <HI>Calderwood</HI> places in capital Let∣ters
these Words:</P>
<P><HI>Here end the sincere General Assemblies of the
Kirk of</HI> Scotland.</P>
<P>The Ministers of this Assembly went on with
renewing the Covenant in all the Presbyteries,
and at last in Parishes; but when it came to
particular Persons, and especially to the Court,
or to those who lived near the Court, <HI>viz,</HI> in
Edinburgh in particular, they declined it, and it
began gradually to drop and be omitted: What
followed we shall soon see.</P>
<P>The excommunicate Lords were not with∣out
their Friends at Court; the King had
been prevailed with to consent to their Return,
but was not willing to take it upon himself
for fear of embroiling himself with the Church,
Whom he feared as well as hated. It was con∣certed
therefore to summon a Parliament, or
Convention of Estates to meet at <HI>Falkland,</HI> and
to get such especially to this Convention as
were in the secret. At the opening the Session
a Motion was made by <HI>Alex. Seatoun,</HI> Brother
to the Lord <HI>Seatoun,</HI> to recal the Lords; it was se∣conded
by several others, using some Threat∣nings,
<PB N="134" REF="137"/>
as if it would be best to do so, least
they should join with the Enemies of their
Country.</P>
<P>To carry on the Point, several Ministers had
Notice given them to be there; but it was
only such as they thought might be easiest
brought to comply. But Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin,</HI>
a famous and most faithful Champion of the
Reformation, went unsent for. It seems he was
appointed or commissioned by the last Assem∣bly
to watch against the imminent Dangers
that might threaten the Church: And this was
his Authority.</P>
<P>When the Ministers were called in, he ap∣pear'd
at the Head of them: The King taking
Notice of it, ask'd <HI>Who sent for him?</HI> He an∣swered,
<HI>SIR, I have a Call to come here from
Christ and his Church, who have a special Concern<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
on what you are doing here, and in direct Oppositi∣on
to whom you are all here assembled; but be ye
assured that no Council taken against him shall pros∣per.
And I charge you, Sir, in his Name, that
you or your Estates, here conveened, favour not
God's Enemies whom he hateth.</HI> After he had
said this, and more to the like Purpose to the
King, he turn'd his Speech to the Members of
the Convention, and “Challeng'd them with
being assembled there with a traiterous De∣sign
against Christ and his Church, and their
native Country:” And was going on when the
King interrupted him, and commanded him to
withdraw, which he did; but soon let the
King hear of him again upon the following Oc∣casion.</P>
<P>The Commission of the <HI>last Assembly</HI> was sit∣ting
at that Time, and finding which Way
Things were going, they resolved to send some
<PB N="135" REF="138"/>
of their Members to the King, to expostulate
this Matter with him: Of these the same Mr.
<HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> was one. When they came to
the King, who received them in his Closet,
Mr. <HI>James Melvin,</HI> being first in the Commissi∣on,
spoke as the Mouth of the rest, and told the
King their Errand from <HI>the Commission.</HI> The
King took him up roundly, and charg'd the
Commission with Sedition, and the Ministers
with being Spreaders of seditious Reports, a∣larming
the People with imaginary Dangers,
and creating needless and unjusft Fears. Mr.
<HI>James</HI> being a courteous, fair spoken Man, be∣gan
to answer the King with Respect and with
great Reverence, when Mr. <HI>Andrew,</HI> taking the
Words out of his Mouth, says he, “Man, this
is not a Time to flatter, but to speak plain∣ly;
for, says he, our Commission is from the
mighty God, to whom the King is but <HI>a silly
Vassal.</HI>” Then taking the King by the Sleeve,
he tells him, <HI>Sir,</HI> we will humbly reverence your
Majesty always, namely in publick; but we have this
Occasion to be with your Majesty in private, and
you are brought in extream Danger, both of your
Life, and of your Grown, and with you the Country
and Kirk of God is like to be wracked, for not
telling the Truth, and giving you a faithful Counsel:
We must discharge our Duty, or else be Enemies to
Christ and you. Therefore, Sir, as diverse Times
before, so now I must tell you, that there are two
Kings, and two Kingdoms. There is Christ and his
Kingdom the Kirk, whose Subject King <HI>James</HI> the
Sixth is, and of whose Kingdom he is not a King,
nor a Head, nor a Lord, but a Member; and they,
whom Christ hath called, and commanded to watch
over his Kirk, and govern his spiritual Kingdom,
have sufficient Authority and Power from him so
<PB N="136" REF="139"/>
to do; which no Christian King nor Prince should
control nor discharge, but fortifie and assist; other∣wise
they are not faithful Subjects to Christ. Sir,
when you were in your swaddling Clouts, Christ
reigned freely in this Land, in Spight of all his
Enemies. His Officers and Ministers conveened and
assembled for ruling of his Kirk, which was ever for
your Welfare also, when the same Enemies were
seeking your Destruction; and have been, by their
Assemblies and Meetings since, terrible to these E∣nemies,
and most steedable for your; will you now,
when there is more than Necessity, challenge Christ's
Servants, your best and most faithful Subjects, for
their conveening, and for the Care they have of their
Duty to Christ and you; whenas you should rather
commend and countenance them, as the godly Kings
and Emperors did. The Wisdom of your Coun∣sel,
which is devilish and pernicious, is this, that
you may be served with all Sorts of Men to come to
your Purpose and Grandour, Jew and Gentile, Pa∣pist
and Protestant. Because the Ministers and
Protestants in <HI>Scotland</HI> are too strong, and con∣trol
the King, they must be weakened and brought
low, by stirring up a Party against them, and the
King being equal and indifferent, both shall be fain
to flee to him: So shall he be well settled. But, Sir,
let God's Wisdom be the only true Wisdom, this
will prove meer and mad Folly: For his Curse can∣not
but light upon it; so that in seeking both, you
shall lose both: Whereas in cleaving uprightly to
God, his true Servants shall be your true Friends,
and he shall compel the rest counterfeitly and lyingly
to serve you, as he did to <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P>It is easie to guess how well this pleased the
King: However, tho' the King was at first ve∣ry
warm and angry, yet he grew calm and
pleasant; protested that he had no Knowledge
<PB N="137" REF="140"/>
of the Return of the Lords, and that offer
what they would, they should have no Favour
from him; till they had fully satisfied the Church.
This Discourse of Mr. <HI>Melvin</HI> to the King, Mr.
<HI>Calderwood</HI> says was taken out of his own Memoirs,
left behind him, written with his own Hand.</P>
<P><HI>The King kept ill his Promises in this Case also;</HI>
for now Dissatisfactions grew high between
the King and the Ministers; the King encroach∣ing
daily upon their Liberties, which they, by
no Means, would give up, they deputed Four
of their Body to the King, to represent, that
there was a most dangerous Jealousie begun be∣tween
him and the Church, which could not
but he fatal to both, and to desire his Majesty
to declare plainly what offended him, that, if
possible, they might give him Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The King answered in few Words, `That
therecould be no Agreement between him and
them till the <HI>Marches</HI> of their <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> were
ridden.' This is a <HI>Scoticism</HI> in Speech, alluding
to the People, who used to ride annually over the
Marches or Borders of both Kingdoms of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
and <HI>Scotland,</HI> to settle and ascertain the
Bounds, as our Parished-Officers do annually in
<HI>England</HI> for the Parishes. This intimated plainly
that the King resolved to put Limits to the
Church's Power, and to restrain them in some
of those Liberties and Privileges which they
claimed as their due. When the King had gi∣ven
them this Hint, he gave also Four Heads
of Complaint against them, in which, he said,
he expected Redress.</P>
<Q><P>1. That in their Preaching, they should
have nothing to do to speak of the King's
Affairs, or of Matters of State.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="141"/>
2. That the General Assembly should not
meet but by the King's Authority and
especial Command.</P>
<P>3. That he have a negative Voice in the
Assembly.</P>
<P>4. That the Church Judicatories meddle
not with Civil Matters, or with any
Matter of Law.</P></Q>
<P>The Ministers now began to see plainly, that
the Platform was laid for the Overthrow of
the Ecclesiastick Constitution: They thought it
was a good Providence to the Church that the
King spoke so directly to his own Designs, and
they acted with the greatest Prudence and Cau∣tion
possible to take from him all Occasion of
Advantage over them. They ordered therefore
(1.) That all the Acts of Parliament, Acts of
Council, Declarations of the King, or other
Documents in Favour of the Liberties and Dis∣cipline
of the Church should be search'd out,
and collected. (2.) That the Presbyteries should
be advertised not to enter into any Debates or
Disputes upon the King's Proposal, that they
might not be supposed to call in Question the
undoubted Liberties and Authority of the
Church. But <HI>he that has a Nail to drive, will
not want a Hammer:</HI> The King had an ill Turn
ready for the Church, and he let them know
it on the following Occasion.</P>
<P>One Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> a Minister in St. <HI>An∣drews,</HI>
had used some distastful Speeches in a
Sermon some Months before, which having
given Offence to the King and Council, they re∣solved
to begin there, and summoned him to
appear before the Council to answer the same.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="142"/>
Thus the King began with them, and they,
on the contrary, found him Work enough; for
in the first Place; they went on in their judicial
Process against the two great Women, whose
Cause the King had openly espoused, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Lady <HI>Huntly,</HI> and the Lady <HI>Levingstone.</HI> To
the first they directed a Libel or Summons to
answer their Charge: This was, if possible, to
prevent her being received at Court, as she
could not well be, while under the Process of
the Church, before she had given Satisfaction.
2. They ordered the Presbytery of <HI>Sterling</HI> to
proceed to Excommunication against the Lady
<HI>Levingston.</HI> And as to Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> they
ordered that he should decline the Judicatory of
the King and Council, <HI>or as we call it in</HI> England,
plead to their Jurisdiction, and refuse to an∣swer
before them. Then they came to a Re∣solution
in the Assembly, <HI>nemine contradicente,</HI>
That all Judgment of Doctrine appertaineth to
the Pastors of the Church <HI>in primâ instantiâ:</HI>
and they appointed a Committee, and farther
ordered all the Ministers to search all the War∣rants
of Scripture, or Precedents in the Laws
of the Realm, to support that Position.</P>
<P>It would swell these Memoirs too much, to
give a Particular of all the Disputes which
pass'd between the King and the Assembly of
Ministers on this Occasion: They waited on him
with their other Demands, and got tolerable
Answers, tho' the King was highly affronted
with Mr. <HI>Patrick Galloway,</HI> one of those that was
sent to him, who told him, <HI>That their Enemies
got Grants and Performance; but the Church got
fair Words and Promises only.</HI> However the King,
upon a new Application, promised them posi∣tively,
that all they desir'd should be granted
<PB N="140" REF="143"/>
with Respect to the Popish Lords and the two
Ladies abovenamed: But there was yet a Sting
in the Tail, about Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> of whom the
King said he must appear and answer for him∣self,
to satisfie the <HI>English</HI> Ambassador, who, it
seems, had complained against him, and <HI>take
heed,</HI> says the King, <HI>that you decline not my Judi∣catory,
for if you do, it will be worse than you
imagine.</HI></P>
<P>Hereupon the Assembly went upon it openly,
resolving not to give up their Rights, and direct∣ed
Mr. <HI>Black</HI> to give in a Writing of Declina∣ture
under his Hand, which, as it is a very cu∣rious
Piece, and of great Consequence in the
Question, and being penn'd with much Art, as
well as maintained with much Vigor, I cannot
omit publishing it, as follows:</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The Declinature of the King and Council's Jtudica∣ture,
in Matters spiritual, namely in preaching
of the Word, given in to the same at Halyrud-House,
by Mr David Black, Minister at St.
Andrews, in his own Name, and in Name of
his whole Brethren of the Ministry, the 18th
Day of November, 1596.</HEAD>
<P>“UNTO your Majesty and Lords of secret
Council, with all Reverence in Christ
humbly meaneth, I Mr. <HI>David Black</HI> Minister
of the Evangel at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> that where I
am charged by your Highness's Letters, to
compear and answer for certain unreverent,
unfamous, and undecent Speeches, alledged ut∣tered
by me in some of my Sermons made in
publick, in the Kirk of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> in the
Month of <HI>October</HI> last by past 1596, as at more
length is contained in the said Letters:
<PB N="141" REF="144"/>
Wherein albeit the Conscience of my innocen∣cy
upholdeth me suffciently, against whatso∣ever
Calumnies of Men; and that I am ready
by the Assistance of the Grace of my God, to
give a Confession, and stand to the Defence of
every Point of the Truth of my God, uttered
by me in the said Sermons, either in opening
up of his Word, or Application thereof, be∣fore
your Majesty or Council, or whatsomever
person or Persons, that upon any lawful Cause,
will crave an Account of that Hope which is
in me, in whatsomever Place or Manner, so
far as shall be requisite for clearing and Main∣tenance
of the Truth, and of my Ministry, and
may be done without the Prejudice of that
Liberty, which the Lord Jesus hath given and
establsed in the spiritual Office-Bearers of
his Kingdom. Yet seeing I am at this Time
brought to stand before his Majesty and Coun∣cil,
as a Judge set to cognosce, and decern
upon my Doctrine, where through my answering
to the said pretended Accusation might
import, with the manifest prejudice of the
Liberties of the Kirk, an Acknowledgment of
your Majesty's Jurisdiction, in Matters that are
meer spiritual, which might move your Ma∣jesty
to attempt farther in the spiritual Go∣vernment
of the House of God, to the Provo∣cation
of his hot Displeasure against your Ma∣jesty,
and in End either a plain subverting of
the spiritual Judicature, or at least a confound∣ing
thereof with the Civil, if at any time pro∣fane
and ambitious Magistrates might by such
dangerous Beginnings find the Hedge broken
down to make a violent Irruption upon the
Lord's Inheritance, which the Lord forbid.
Therefore I am constrained, in all Humility
<PB N="142" REF="145"/>
and Submission of Mind, to use a Declinature
of this Judgment, at least <HI>in prima instantia;</HI>
which I beseech your Majesty to consider ear∣nestly,
and accept of, according to Justice, for
the Reasons following.”</P>
<P>“The Lord Jesus, the God of Order, and not
of Confusion, as appareth evidently in all the
Churches of the Saints, of whom only I have
the Grace of my Calling, as his Ambassador,
albeit most unworthy of that Honour, to bear
his Name among his Saints, hath given me his
Word, and no Law or Tradition of Man, as
the only Instructions, whereby I should rule the
whole Actions of my calling, in Preaching of
the Word, Administration of the Seals there∣of,
and Exercise of Discipline: And in the Dis∣charge
of this Commission I cannot fall in Re∣verence
of any Civil Law of Man, but in so
far as I shall be found to have passed the Com∣pass
of my Instructions, which cannot be judg∣ed,
according to the Order established by that
God of Order, but by the Prophets, whose Lips
he hath appointed to be Keepers of his hea∣venly
Wisdom, and to whom he has subjected
the Spirits of the Prophets. And now seeing
it is the Preaching of the Word, whereupon I
am accused, which is a principal Point of my
Calling, of Necessity the Prophets must first
declare, whether I have keeped the Bounds of
my Directions, before I come to be judged of
your Majesty's Laws, for My Offence.”</P>
<P>“Because the Liberty of the Kirk, and whole
Discipline thereof, according as the same has
been, and is presently, exercised within your
Majesty's Realm, has been confirmed by diverse
Acts of Parliament, and approved by the Con∣fession
of Faith, by the Subscription and Oath
<PB N="143" REF="146"/>
of your Majesty and Majesty's Estates, and
whole Body of the Country, and peaceably
enjoyed by the Officebearers of the Kirk in all
Points; and namely in the foresaid Point,
touching the Judgment of the preaching of
the Word <HI>in prima instantia,</HI> as the Practice of
diverse late Examples evidently will shew.
Therefore the Question touching my Preach∣ing
ought first, according to the Grounds and
Practice foresaid, be judged by the Ecclesiasti∣cal
Senate, as the competent Judge thereof, in
the first Instance.”</P>
<P>“In Respect whereof, and for diverse other
weighty Causes and Considerations, namely
of eschewing the great and dangerous Incon∣veniences,
that might fall both to Religion
and to your Majesty's own Estate, by the Ap∣pearance
of Distraction of your Majesty's Af∣fection
from the Ministry, and good Cause of
God in their Hands, to the Grief of your Ma∣jesty's
best Subjects, and to the Encouragement
of the Adversaries, both of your Majesty's
E∣state and Religion. Therefore I most humbly
beseech your Majesty, and in the Name of
my Brethren the Commissioners of the General
Assembly, and the Remnant of the Brethren
of the Ministry, who, for testifying their ear∣nest
Affection and Allowance of the Premisses,
have subscribed these Presents with their
Hands, that your Majesty in this Action,
would manifest your earnest Care to maintain
that Liberty, which the Church of Christ
within the Country, for the Comfort of the
Saints, hath with so great Blessing enjoyed,
since the Gospel was first revealed in this
Land, wherethrough the Godly may be com∣forted,
the Adversaries frustrated of their Ex∣pectation,
<PB N="144" REF="147"/>
and your Majesty truly honoured
in honouring the Lord Jesus.”</P>
<P>The Foundation of Discontent being thus
laid on both Sides, all Things tended to an
open Rupture between the Parties: The King
at the Head of the Civil Power, and the As∣sembly
at the Head of the Ecclesiastick, push'd
at one another without any Appearance of a
Reconciliation. It is, without doubt, that the
King was Aggressor: He found the Severity of
the Ministers a Burthen that he could by no
Means bear. They said the same of his Invasions
upon their Liberties. Several Proposals of Ac∣commodation
were made, and sometimes they
came very near to one another, nay, at one Time
the King was brought to agree to the Mediums
they proposed, but the next Morning they found
his Mind quite altered again, and if it be true
which one of the Writers of those Times af∣firms,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the King was resolved upon
setting up Episcopacy, and had named the Bi∣shops
to every Diocess<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 358.</NOTE>, before Mr. <HI>Black</HI>'s
Declinature above. It is no more to be won∣dred
at, 'that tho' his Majesty might some∣times
seem to comply with them, for Delay, or
for other private Reasons, yet that they always
found he changed his Mind when it came to
the Point to be concluded.</P>
<P>It would be endless to set down here the
many Particulars of this Breach. Take the Sum
of them thus. Upon the failing of the many
Attempts to accommodate Matters, the Mini∣sters
preached openly and vehemently against
<PB N="145" REF="148"/>
the King's Proceedings, defended the Jurisdiction
of the Church, and daily drew the People to them.
this nettled and alarmed the King: He attempt∣ed
to perswade the Commissioners of the Assembly
by fair Means, to direct the Ministers not to
meddle. They answered, they could not be
silent, while he went on to sap the Foundati∣ons
of their Liberties, and overthrow the Dis∣cipline;
that it was their Duty to speak freely
and plainly: When Perswasions availed not, he
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sed Force; he charged the Commissioners of
the Assembly to depart the City of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
and publish'd this Charge at the Cross of <HI>Edin∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urgh:</HI>
He ordered the Council to proceed a∣gainst
Mr. <HI>David Black,</HI> notwithstanding his De∣clinature,
and to condemn him of Contumacy,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entencing him to enter into Ward, upon Pain
of <HI>Rebellion</HI> and <HI>Horning:</HI> His Crime was said to
be, <HI>For treasonable, uncivil, sladerous, and sediti∣ous
Words, Calumnies, and Speeches uttered by him
against the Queen, the Queen of</HI> England, <HI>the
Nobility, Council, and Session.</HI></P>
<P>Besides this, the King refused grant the
Stipends to the <HI>Northern</HI> Ministers, for whom
the Commissioners of the Assembly had petiti∣oned;
the King's Answer was, <HI>That such as would
aknowledge his Authority, should have their Sala∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies;
but he would give no Fee to such as would
disclaim their Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the Commissioners being warn'd to de∣part,
they published an Exhortation to the
Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as they should answer
it to God and his Church, to discharge their
Duty in so necessary and dangerous a juncture,
and to call before them the open and malici∣ous
Enemies of the Church, of whatsoever
Rank, and proceed against them, even to Ex∣communication,
<PB N="146" REF="149"/>
comunication, if they relaxed not: Likewise
to the Ministers of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to stand to their
Calling, and not to be slack in their Duty;
with Caution however that if Violence was
used; for there was a Report, that they should
be pull'd out of their Pulpits by armed
Men, they should give Place to the Fury, and
make no Resistance; and then publishing a long
Declaration, for Vindication of their Proceed∣ings,
and protesting against the Injustice that
was used towards them, they departed. This
was in <HI>December</HI> 1596.</P>
<P>The same Month the King fell upon the Mi∣nisters
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and without any particala<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Accusation or Crime alledged, charg'd Fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
of them, <HI>viz. Robert Bruce, James Balfour, Wal∣ter,
Bacanquell William Watson,</HI> to enter
in∣to Ward; that is to say, to go to Prison, with∣in
Six Hours after the Proclamation, upon Pair
of horning; they not doing it, Orders
were sent to the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> to appre∣hend
them but they fled to the Borders
There were also several of the Inhabitants o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<HI>Edinburgh</HI> in the same Condition, being all such
as were eminent for their Zeal to the true
Re∣ligion. But this was not all.</P>
<P>For the King resolving now to carry
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Game on to the uttermost, contriv'd a Writing
of Recognition, which was called there the
BAND, which all the Ministers were requi∣red
to sign, on pain of losing their Stipends▪
The Copy of which Band or Engagement is <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<DIV3>
<PB N="147" REF="150"/>
<HEAD>The Copy of the Band, ordained by his Majesty and
Estates, to be subscribed by every one of the Mi∣nistry
under the Pain of losing their Stipends.</HEAD>
<P>WE the Pastors and Ministers of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
underscribing, humbly acknowledging
our Duty to God, and Obedience to the King
our Sovereign, whom for Conscience Sake we
ought to obey, confess, that he is our Sove∣reign
Judge; to us, and every one of us, in all
Causes of Sedition and Treason, and other
civil and criminal Matters; and to all our
Speeches, which may import the said Crimes,
albeit uttered by any of us publickly in Pul∣pit
(which God forbid) or in any other Place:
And that the said Pulpits, nor no other Place
whatsoever, have that Privilege or Immunity,
to be Occasion or Pretence to any of us of
declining his Majesty's Judgment, in any of
the said civil or criminal Causes intended, or
to be intended against any of us, in time
coming; but rather that our Offence is the
greater, in Case any of us commit such Crimes
in the said Pulpits (which God forbid) where
the Word of God, his Truth and Salvation
should be preached by us unto our Flocks. In
Witness whereof, and of our humble Acknow∣ledging
of our Duty in the Premises, we have
subscribed these Presents with our Hands,
and are content the same be registrat in the
Books of our Sovereign's secret Council <HI>in
futuram rei memoriam.</HI></P>
<P>After this, <HI>for now the Mask was thrown off,</HI>
Proclamation was publish'd, by Sound of
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rumpet, at the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> empower∣ing
<PB N="148" REF="151"/>
and requiring all Magistrates, Barons, and
Gentlemen of Power, to interrupt any of the
Ministers if they should utter any Speeches ten∣ding
to Sedition from their Pulpits; or any
Speeches, in Reproach, Contempt, or Disdain
of the King, his Progenitors, or his Council, an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
any of their Proceedings; and to imprison an<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
detain them till Notice should be given to the
Council, and Orders from thence received∣about them.</P>
<P>To this Pass Things were come, in the Space
of one Year.</P>
<P>The Ministers, generally speaking, refused the
Band, with Abhorrence; and published their
Reasons for it, with their Apologies and
De∣fences in abundance; and some publick Meet∣ings
did the like, as the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> in par∣ticular.</P>
<P>We are now come to a Meeting, called By
the King a General Assembly; but not owned to be su<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
by the Church. The King having, as is said, claim∣ed
the Right of calling the General Assembly
tho' the Church had by no Means yielded <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
that Point, his Majestry thought fit to act upon
that Right, and summoned a Convention of Mi∣nisters
at <HI>Perth,</HI> to meet the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>February</HI>
1597. The Ministers, who came thither,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>at the King's Appointment,</HI> so there was a Viola∣tion
of the Liberties of the Church, in the
ve∣ry Entrance; for, by the Constitution, the Churc<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>has
the Right of calling, as well as of constitu∣ting
their Assemblies. But this was not all; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
as the Assembly was called by the King, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
were the Members nominated chiefly by him
and especially the <HI>Northern</HI> Ministers, who ap∣peared
in an unusual Number; and yet. as it was
they were for some time doubtful, whether t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="149" REF="152"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave it called an Assembly or not: Old <HI>James
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>selvin</HI> denied it to be an Assembly; but the
<HI>Northern</HI> Men outvoted them, the King also
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ining his Authority: However, eight Presby∣eres
entirely opposed it, eleven, on the other
Hand, approving it: The Commissioners of the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>resbytery of <HI>Fife</HI> made a Protestation against
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and against all that should be done in it.</P>
<P>Two Things the King attempted here upon
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em, yet neither succeeded thoroughly. First,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e King, on Pretence of conferring with them
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n some Affairs of Moment, appoints them to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eet, in the same Place, with the King and his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>states. This was a Wyle, to bring them to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive fitten as it were in Parliament; but the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>und Ministers saw it, and protested against
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Next, the King would have entered into
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iscourse of the Point in Controversie, but the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Ministers refused to put any of the Heads
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c their Discipline in Question; neither would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ey reason or speak upon them at all. The
King press'd it, but to no Purpose: The King
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ried them again, and they came to the Place,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut would enter upon no Business there; but
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade a long Protestation against whatever should
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done in that Meeting, as not being lawful∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y
constituted.</P>
<P>Having thus denied the Legality of this As∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>embly,
and refused to act, the King was left
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> go on as he liked; nor are the Things done,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aid to be rightly recorded, or any Dependance
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be had upon them. But in a Word, the
King went on his own Way, and brought his
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nds about by such arbitrary Methods, and yet
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y a specious Pretence of legal Steps, as may ea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly
he imagin'd. He exhibited 13 Articles to
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, every one of which was a Violation of
<PB N="150" REF="153"/>
their former Discipline; the Consequence of
this was bringing in the excommunicated Lords,
and at length setting up Episcopacy in the
Church.</P>
<P>In the mean Time, the legal Assembly had
been appointed to meet at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> on the
<HI>27th</HI> of <HI>April</HI> 1597, and the Moderator of the
former Assembly went thither accordingly, and
tho' the Number was not great, yet they met
in Form, constituted themselves regularly, and
having begun the Assembly with Prayer, as u∣sual,
and appointed a Fast for Confession of Sins,
they made Protestations for the Liberty of the
Church, and referr'd all other Business to the
next Meeting. This is the Assembly which the
King disowned.</P>
<P>The King, in the mean Time, went on the
other Way, and appoints another Assembly of
his new Model, to meet at <HI>Dundee,</HI> in the
Month of <HI>May</HI> after. Thus the Church was
miserably divided, and her Discipline trodden
under Foot: At this Assembly the King, as it
is said, aimed at Two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.) Bring∣ing
in the excommunicated Lords. And (2.)
acknowledging the Meeting at <HI>Perth</HI> for a
Assembly of the Church; both which the King▪
who had, by this Time, <HI>wheedled off,</HI> or <HI>brought off</HI>
many of the poorer of the Ministry to his Par∣ty,
easily obtained; some complying for Pre∣ferment,
some for the Honour, and some the
Profits of the Court; for it was an easie Mat∣ter,
<HI>says the Historian of that Time, Mr.</HI> Calder∣wood,
to draw such as thirsted for Gain and
Glory, to farther the Intentions of the Court▪
Thus a dreadful Schism was made in the Church
Which also became wider every Day. The As∣sembly
<PB N="151" REF="154"/>
of <HI>Dundee</HI> absolved the Popish Lords;
gave up the Liberty of Rebuking the Crimes of
the great ones; committed Matters of the great∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est
Import to a few, and those such as appear∣ed
devoted to the Court; quitted summary Ex∣communication,
tho' for notorious Crimes; a∣bolished
all Meetings of Ministers, not warrant∣ed
by the King, or forbidden; and all ecclesi∣astick
Matters to be treated of in the Assembly,
were, by this Model, to be first prepared and de∣termined
of by the King: So, <HI>says the same Wri∣ter,</HI>
the Assembly was now no more than the
King's LED HORSE; and all this was
brought to pass by subtle dividing the Mi∣nisters,
and awing or enticing some from the
rest; who, back'd and supported by the King,
and joined with the Creatures of the Court,
carried on his Designs to the Ruin of all true
Religion.</P>
<P>And now came on the grand Design; for the
King having gained a Number of <HI>false Brethren,</HI>
(a remarkable Word) he had every Thing done
to his Hand. The Parliament being sitting,
the Commissioners of the General Assembly pe∣tition,
in the Name of the Church, <HI>tho' falsely;
for the main Body of the Church abhorred the Thought
of such a Thing,</HI> for Ministers to be allowed to sit
and vote in Parliament. This was granted, and
pass'd into an Act, and the very Words of the Act
openly declared the Meaning of the Thing, (<HI>viz</HI>)
That those Ministers who should vote in Parlia∣ment
should be Bishops, or Prelates. The Words are
these: <HI>That such Pastors</HI> and Ministers as his Majesty
shall, at any Time, please to provide to the Office, Place,
Title, and Dignity of Bishop, Abbot, <HI>or other</HI> Prelate,
<HI>shall at any Time hereafter, have Vote in Parliament,</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="155"/>
as by the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts of Parliament for</HI> Scotland, Part 1. page 177.</NOTE> Act may be seen at large, This was
in <HI>December</HI> 1597.</P>
<P>On the <HI>7th</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1598, another <HI>Royal
Assembly,</HI> for such it was, <HI>not an Assembly of the
Church,</HI> met at <HI>Dundee,</HI> of which I need say no
more than this, that by the same Art and Ma∣nagement
that the rest was carried on, the Act
of Parliament, for Ministers to vote in Parlia∣ment,
was approved, in the said Assembly, with
all the Formality and Pretence of Good to the
Church imaginable.</P>
<P>The Glory of the purest Church in the World,
<HI>I use the King's own Words,</HI> being thus under
an almost total Eclipse, was strangely represent∣ed
ed that same Year in the Firmament, the most,
glorious Lamp of Heaven, the <HI>SƲN,</HI> suffering at
this Time, a most fearful Eclipse, <HI>so the Histo∣rians
of that Day call it,</HI> the whole Face of the
Sun being covered and darkened; but it plea∣sed
God to put them in mind by it, that altho'
it was of a long Duration, <HI>viz.</HI> near Two Hours
before it went quite off, yet the Sun recover∣ed
again its full Lustre. And thus the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> likewise has since done after many
dreadful Eclipses and Hours of Darkness.</P>
<P>The next Year finish'd the Work: The gi∣ving
the Ministers a Vote in Parliament had
been already past; the King summoned a Num∣ber
of Ministers to a Conference at <HI>Halyrcod-House,</HI>
where he thought fit to have some of
the best Sort called; but took Care to secure
a Majority of his own Party: Here, for Forma∣lity
Sake, those Things were debated and re∣solved,
which the King before had resolved,
<PB N="153" REF="156"/>
without debating: The Questions were not, if
the giving the Ministers Votes should be con∣firmed;
that was past and over before; but <HI>how
many</HI> their Number should be, who should <HI>chuse
them,</HI> and <HI>what Title</HI> they should have? Where,
finally, their Number, and the Choice of them,
was left to the King; and it was ordered that
they should have the Title of <HI>BISHOP.</HI> And
thus this long contriv'd Design obtained its fi∣nishing
Stroke, and Episcopacy was established
in, or rather upon the Ruins of, the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>I have been more particular in this Part, as
it relates to the Manner how Episcopacy got
its first footing in the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> that
the Fraud, the Artifice, and hypocritical Fawn∣ings,
the arbitrary and outragious Dealing,
which were practised with the Ministers, might
appear; as also the Strugglings and Oppositi∣on
it met with for so many Years. The next
succeeding Years will require little to be said:
The King had gain'd his Point; the Gradati∣ons,
by which Episcopacy proceeded, as it ever
idid in <HI>Scotland,</HI> from Power to Persecution, and
at length to its own Ruin and Downfal; as
they were publick, so our Account shall be
more concise and general.</P>
<P>The Time drew near now that the King was
to receive an Addition of Glory, and be call∣ed
to a Kingdom infinitely more opulent, po∣pulous,
and powerful than his own; and with∣al,
wrapt up in that Ecclesiastick Hierarchy
which he so much desir'd; in the mean Time,
he spent the Hours in daily Contests with the
Presbyterian Ministers, <HI>for the other are not now
to be called so,</HI> oppressing, imprisoning, remo∣ving,
banishing; so that no sooner was he be∣come
<PB N="154" REF="157"/>
come a King of an Episcopal Church, but, as
was always natural to the Spirit of Episcopacy
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he became a Persecutor; nay, a
Persecutor of that very Church, which, as before
is observed, he had, in the Face of the Assembly,
with Eyes and Hands lifted up to Heaven, so∣lemnly
praised and blessed God for being born
in, and made King of; calling it, <HI>alas i with
what Hypocrisie!</HI> the purest, the sincerest Church
on Earth.</P>
<P>This was the Time when the King writ that
flattering Letter to the Pope, stiling him, in the
Beginning, <HI>Beatissime Pater Pontificem maximum,</HI>
and the like; which, to escape the Censure of, he
caused, many Years afterwards, the Reproach
of to be laid upon another Person, who, it was
pretended, deceived the King; and having pri∣vately
penn'd the Letter, got the King to sign
it in a Crowd of other Writings which were
to pass the Sign-Manual, and which the King
signed of Course, without reading; but if other
Authors may be believ'd, the King, who, was
not To hurried with Business, while King of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but that, in other Cases, he was quick
sighted enough, and used not to let the smallest
Matter pass unobserved, was not to be thus de∣ceived.</P>
<P>This was the Time when Mr. <HI>John Spotswood,</HI>
who was prosecuted e<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by the King's Friends
in the Church, for having been at <HI>MASS</HI> o∣penly
in France, was protected by the King
from their Censure, and afterwards made Arch∣bishop
of St. <HI>Andrews;</HI> the same who writ the
History afterwards of these Times, and is so
often quoted in these Memoirs.</P>
<P>On the <HI>31st</HI> of <HI>March</HI> 1603, an Express ar∣rived
from <HI>England,</HI> bringing News of the Death
<PB N="155" REF="158"/>
of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> with Letters of Recogniti∣on
from the Privy-Council there, who had pro∣claimed
his Majesty King of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ire∣land.</HI>
As the King read the Letters, his Coun∣tenance
Chang'd; the Lords near-hand feared he
bad been taken ill, when, on a sudden, he left
off reading, and lift up his Hands and Eyes to
Heaven, as tho' he had prayed; and giving the
better to one of the Lords that stood next him,
said, The <HI>Queen's dead: Read that Letter,</HI> Man.</P>
<P>Immediately the Lords congratulated him,
and the Court rung with Joy; the Guns at the
Castle were fired, and the King was proclaim∣ed
at the Market-Cross of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> King of
<HI>England, France,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The next Sabbath, being the <HI>3d</HI> of <HI>April,</HI> the
King made the following Speech to the People,
in the great Church, which, I observe, because
he scarce ever performed one Word of it at all.</P>
<P>As God hath promoved me to a greater Power,
than I had; so I must endeavour to establish Re∣ligion,
and to take away Corruption, in both the
Countries. Ye need not doubt, but as I have a Body
as able as any King in <HI>Europe,</HI> whereby I am a∣ble
to travel; so I shall visit you every Three Years
at least, or oftner as I shall have Occasion; (for
so have I written in my Book directed to my Son,
and it were a Shame to me not to perform that,
which I have written) that I may with my own
Mouth take Account of the Execution of Justice
of them that are under me; and that ye your selves
may see and hear me, and from the meanest to the
greatest have Access to my Person, and pour out your
Complaints in my Bosom. This shall ever be my
Course.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="159"/>
The Triumphs of this new Accession of
Power to the King, his Passage into <HI>England,</HI>
his Reception there, his Coronation, and other
Ceremonies, are no Part of this Work; I shall
say only this of them, that they, together with the
<HI>English</HI> Business, almost took the King wholly off
of <HI>Scots</HI> Affairs for the first two or three Years
of his Reign, and he did little but confirm and
establish his new Fabrick in the Church.</P>
<P>In this Condition Things stood with the
Church almost all the rest of the Reign of
King <HI>James,</HI> the Authority of the Church Judi∣catories
was wholly lost, their Discipline de∣stroyed,
and the Government dissolved into a
prelatick Hierarchy.</P>
<P>It is true, the King being absent, and em∣barrass'd
with the <HI>English</HI> Affairs, they did not
push on the designed Persecution so far, or so
fast, as, its very likely, he would otherwise
have done; but still the Council continued daily
to invade the Privileges of the Church, and by
Encroachments of one Kind or other, went on
to oppress them; and upon every Step the Mi∣nisters
took, to assert their Right, or defend
their Privileges, they were proceeded against by
the Council as Criminals; and once no less than
Six of the Ministers were tried for high Trea∣son,
and condemned to Death, for declining the
Judicature of the Council, and continuing to
assemble at Aberdeen, without the King's Authority;
but the King would not fuffer them
to be executed: What he did with them we
shall see presently. First, a Proclamation was
published, forbidding all People, either in pub∣lick
or private, to call in Question his Majesty's
Proceedings against the said Ministers. Then
the Cause slept a while, the Parliament being
<PB N="157" REF="160"/>
to meet. This was the Year 1606, when the
Parliament met at <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> but was adjourn∣ed
to <HI>Perth;</HI> in which the Act was pass'd, enti∣tuled,
<HI>The Act for Restitution of Bishops,</HI> by
which the Temporalities of the old Bishopricks
were likewise restored to the Church, having
before been given to the Crown by a Law call∣ed
the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Act of <HI>Scots</HI> Parliament, Part 1. pag. 759.</NOTE> Act of Annexation.</P>
<P>The first Thing of Note which happened
after the King's Accession to the Crown of <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
and the last Thing of this Nature which
we shall bring into these Memoirs was, That
memorable Conference at <HI>Hampton-Courts,</HI> be∣tween
the eight Ministers of the Presbyterian
Church and the King, upon the Matters then in
Dispute. The Case in short was this, the Pres∣byterian
Ministers had met in an Assembly, as
was already noted, at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> without the
King's Authority, as they insisted they might
legally do; the King discharg'd or dissolv'd
their Meeting as illegal, but they continued to
meet for all that: And when some of them
were delated, or indicted, <HI>as we call it,</HI> before
the Court of Justice for that Contempt, they
declined the Authority of the King, <HI>that is to
say,</HI> his Authority to take Cognizance of those
Affairs; for they never disputed his Authority
in Civil Matters: For this they were again in∣dicted,
brought to Trial, found guilty of high
Treason, and received Sentence of Death, as
above.</P>
<P>But the King finding, that this pushing
Things to Extremity would not fully answer his
End, and willing rather to proceed by other
<PB N="158" REF="161"/>
Methods, concluded at length to have the Cause
brought to <HI>London,</HI> where it should be publick∣ly
heard before himself and the Council, not
doubting but it should be so managed there, as
that he should either really have the Victory, or
at least seem to have it; hereupon making shew
to desire an Agreement, he (the King) caused
a certain Number of the <HI>Scots</HI> Ministers on both
Sides, to be summoned to appear before him
at <HI>London.</HI> Their Names were as follow, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>

<P>And as this was a most eminent Transaction,
by which the Craft, Drift, and Weakness in
Argument, in the <HI>Scots</HI> Episcopal Partys, and
the Capacity, Fidelity, and Courage of the Mi∣nisters,
were more than ordinarily conspicuous;
and that it is necessary the Reader should have
it faithfully and fully stated; I say, for this Rea∣son,
I shall impartially relate the Fact, as it is
set down in the Histories of those Times, ta∣king
one Historian on one Side, and one of the
other, that the impartial Reader may judge for
himself, without any Gloss or Comment on our
Side, and the Conduct of both Sides may be
clearly seen. And because some may think the
reciting this Story, however memorable and
worth their Reading, too long an Interruption
to the Thread of Story, and yet that those,
<PB N="159" REF="162"/>
whose Curiosity is worth obliging, may not be
disappointed; and above all, that the Truth of
Fact may impartially be handed down to Po∣sterity,
that they may have a true Notion, and
be able to make a right Judgment of so re∣markable
an Event, I have placed it at large,
among other Things, by way of <HI>addenda</HI> to,
and at the End of this second Part of the Work,
where it may be read by it self, <HI>No.</HI> C, D.</P>
<P>After that Conference, as it was called, was
over, and the King had found that neither, by
Perswasion, nor Threatning, any thing was to
be done with them, so as to get the Power, he
ad assumed, confirmed by them, or the Pro∣ceedings
against their Brethren approved; he
dismissed them, and went to work with the
Ministers who were under Sentence: He found
it not for his Purpose to put them to Death;
he knew too well what a Flame it would kin∣dle
in <HI>Scotland:</HI> However, to put as great a
Show of Resentment upon it as he thought
might answer his End, he appointed a Court
of justice to sit at <HI>Lithgow,</HI> where the six con∣demned
Ministers were brought, to receive
their Sentence, which the King was pleased to
change from that of Death into that of Ba∣nishment,
never to return, on Pain of Death.
Their Names were as follows:</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>John Forbes,</HI> Minister of <HI>Awford.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>John Welch,</HI> Minister of <HI>Aire.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Robert Dury,</HI> Minister of <HI>Anster.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>Mr. <HI>John Sharp,</HI> Minister of <HI>Kilmeny.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="160" REF="163"/>
Besides these, by a Letter from the King,
directed to the Council, eight Ministers more
were confined for their Lives, or during the
King's Pleasure, in the most distant, and most
remote and barbarous Places of his Kingdom,
<HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Charles Farum,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Bute.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>John Monroe,</HI> in <HI>Kyntyre.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Robert Youngson,</HI> in the Isle of <HI>Arran.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>Mr. <HI>James Gray,</HI> in <HI>Caithness.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. <HI>Nath. Inglis,</HI> in <HI>Sutherland.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These Ministers thus sent into Banishment,
were also commanded not to come out of the
Bounds of their Confinement, upon Pain of
Death; and by another Proclamation, all other
Ministers were forbidden to recommend, in
their Prayers or Sermons, any of those so sen∣tenc'd:
This was esteemed a greater Cruelty
than the rest; likewise the Ministers at Court,
were forbidden to go back to <HI>Scotland,</HI> and one
of them, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> was taken
up, on Pretence of Words spoken in <HI>London,</HI>
and some <HI>Latin</HI> Verses made by him, reflecting
on the Cathedral-Worship in <HI>England,</HI> and was
sent to the Tower, and kept there Three Years,
after which he was banished into <HI>France,</HI> where
he ended his Days.</P>
<P>But Things ended not here; for the King
being not able to get his Will of the Mini∣sters
by the Violences above; continued, notwithstanding,
to make Innovations in their Dis∣cipline
and Government, and therefore in the
<PB N="161" REF="164"/>
Assembly held at <HI>Linlithgow, December</HI> 10. 1606,
he brought in. the Overture of <HI>constant Modera∣tors</HI>
in the Presbyteries, and the Ministers of
the Assembly being always a Majority of the
wrong Side, after a few had opposed it, agreed
to admit them upon some Conditions, tho'
they could never bring the Presbyteries to ac∣cept
of them.</P>
<P>But now came on a Blow which even the
Ministers themselves did not foresee, I mean
the Five Articles concerning Worship, called
afterwards <HI>the Articles of</HI> Perth. The Consti∣tution
of the Church consists, as it is political∣ly
understood of 4 principal Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> (1.)
Her Doctrine. (2.) Her Worship. (3) Her Dis∣cipline.
And, (4.) Her Government. The two
last were effectually redue'd, and the King had
his Will of them, as you have heard; her Do∣ctrine
and Worship seemed still to remain.
But now the King began to attack their Wor∣ship,
being resolved to bring the Church's
Neck under the Feet of her Enemies.</P>
<P>It was the Year 1617, when the King took
this Journey into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and where it was
expected, by his Presence, he should carry eve∣ry
Point; but he failed in several. And first,
at the Meeting of the Parliament he proposed
an Article, importing, “That whatever was
resolved or concluded, by his Majesty, with
Advice of the Archbishops and Bishops, in
Matters of external Polity in the Church,
should have the Force of an Ecclesiastick Law.”
This was a bold Stroke, even the Bishops them∣selves
startled at it <HI>at first,</HI> and the Ministers
signed a general Protestation against it, which
the King coming to the Knowledge of, the Ar∣ticle
was dropped, and so the Protestation was
<PB N="162" REF="165"/>
not delivered in; but the King resolved to
exercise the Power <HI>without the Ceremony of an
Act,</HI> as we shall see presently.</P>
<P>The King summoned the Bishops to meet
him at St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> where, in a set Speech to
them, he proposed what he after obtained the
Bishops referred him to an Assembly, but the
King, who owned that he resolved never to
have any more Assemblies, was very averse to
an Assembly, and it was now evident that the
Reason why the King had proposed formerly
the Article abovenamed was, that the Power
of making Ecclesiastick Laws being vested in
himself, he might have no more Occasion for
Assemblies, which even, tho' Episcopal, were
very much his Aversion.</P>
<P>However, in short, upon the Entreaty of the
Bishops, and Promises of Compliance in some
<HI>Time-serving Ministers,</HI> the King called an As∣sembly
to meet at <HI>Perth,</HI> the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>August</HI>
1617. There had been one held at St. <HI>An∣drews</HI>
the <HI>November</HI> before, which disgusted
the King very much in not complying with
his Demands.</P>
<P>In this Assembly the Worship, as well as
the Discipline was innovated, and the Conclu∣sions
were pass'd in the following Heads, af∣terwards
called, as above, <HI>the 5 Articles of</HI>
Perth. The Articles at large are to be found
in the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Spotswood, Hist. of the Church of</HI> Scot. <HI>fol.</HI> 539.</NOTE> Histories<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Calderwood <HI>fol.</HI> 611.</NOTE> of those Times; but
in short, they contained, (1.) The Kneeling at
the Communion. (2.) Private Communion at
sick Peoples Request. (3.) Private Baptism. (4.)
<PB N="163" REF="166"/>
Confirmation of Children. (5.) Observation of
Festivals. All which was now to be imposed
upon the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>When the Articles were past, Order was sent
to all the Ministers to intimate them in their
Churches, to exhort the People to conform to
them, and to preach upon the Lawfulness of it.
But this it was never in their Power to do, nor,
where Ministers did conform, was it in their
Power to make the People comply with, or
hear them; but a dreadful Rent being thus
made in the Church, the People divided from
the Ministers, and the dissenting Ministers set
up private Communions, and were almost uni∣versally
followed, as will appear presently.</P>
<P>But to return to the Affair of the Mini∣sters
in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> Ministers beha∣ved
with such Courage and such Steddiness,
that the Court could get no Ground of them;
but was forc'd to have Recourse to Coercion
and Persecution in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in <HI>England</HI> al∣so:
The Six Ministers, instead of being dispu∣ted
with, were imprisoned, and long harrass'd
from Place to Place; so that some of them
never saw <HI>Scotland</HI> more. If I enter not far in∣to
the Particulars of those Times, it is because <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
would not record some Things practised up∣on
them by some of the Clergy in <HI>England,</HI>
which it may not be grateful to Posterity to
hear; for it is not the Conduct in <HI>England,</HI>
but the Conduct in <HI>Scotland</HI> that these Memoirs
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re written about.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter is this, in few
Words; the King having miss'd of his Triumph,
and of reducing the Ministers to a Necessity of
submitting, resolved however not to miss of
is Design in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and to this End he esta∣blished
<PB N="164" REF="167"/>
a high Commission-Court there, to en∣force
the Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> and in a Word,
to abolish the Constitution of the Church of
<HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>First, instead of the General Assembly, the
King, by his special Warrant, summoned a
Convention, not of the Estates, but of Mini∣sters,
to meet at <HI>Linlithgo,</HI> the <HI>10th</HI> of <HI>December</HI>
1606; instead of the Presbyteries electing the
Ministers, as was usual. to represent them, the
King's Letter was sent, directed to the Pres∣byteries,
ordering them to send such Men, by
Name, as the King had directed. Let any <HI>En∣glishman</HI>
conceive of this, as if the King of <HI>En∣gland</HI>
were to summon a Parliament to meet at
<HI>Westminster,</HI> and instead of issuing out Writs,
for Elections of Members, should name the
Members whom they should send tip. This, was
the Method in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and with the same
Justice; and because this is a Novelty that ne∣ver
was practised before or since, I have given
the Copy of the Warrant, for thus sending up
of Ministers, at the End of this Part, <HI>No.</HI> D.</P>
<P>In this Meeting the Project of constant Mo∣derators
in the Presbyteries was proposed, it is
called the King's Advice to the Assembly; but
any one may guess what the Meaning of such a
Phrase must be; when King's advise, especially
to their own Subjects, they will not take it <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
if their People take it for a Command, and so
it prov'd; for the Act past without
on.</P>
<P>Great Arts were used, and some Violence, to
bring the Presbyteries to accept these constan
Moderators, nor could all the Threatnings and
Violence that was practised, bring them to it
The Presbytery of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was told plainly
<PB N="165" REF="168"/>
that if the Presbyteries refused them, the King
would overthrow the Presbyteries themselves,
and there should be no more in <HI>Scotland;</HI> but
all would not do: They named a Moderator
pro <HI>interim,</HI> to continue to the next General
Assembly, and, would do no otherwise; and the
like did other Presbyteries also.</P>
<P>At length the Presbyteries were charg'd, in
he King's Name, and on Pain of Rebellion,
and putting them to the Horn, to accept them:
his prevail'd with some, but many stood out,
and some of the Moderators themselves refused
accept. Not one of the Synods in <HI>Scotland</HI>
would accept them, except <HI>Angus;</HI> no Threats,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Cunning, for neither were wanting, could
bring them to it.</P>
<P>By this Time the Court found that all the
Arts hitherto used, for subverting the Church,
however they might establish a new Constitu∣tion,
would never bring the Ministers to com∣ply,
till they came to downright Persecution;
and therefore it was resolved to take that Course
by a high Commission-Court, in the Pursuit of
whose Powers, the Ministers were to be brought
by Violence, by Persecution, Horning, that is
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o say, Banishment and Confiscation of Goods,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o abandon their Flocks, and lay down the
Office of Ministers.<NOTE PLACE="foot">Calderwood, <HI>fol.</HI> 550.</NOTE></P>
<P>It was in the Year 1616, that the Commission-Courts
were first erected, <HI>viz.</HI> one in each Arch∣bishoprick.
This Commission was the highest
Exercise of Tyranny that was ever practised
by any King in <HI>Great Britain</HI> since Laws and
Constitutions were allowed to be the Rule of
<PB N="166" REF="169"/>
the Government; for it actually put the King
in, Possession of the Bodies and Goods of all his
Subjects, and empowered him to use them as
he pleased, without the ordinary Forms of Ju∣stice,
and meerly by the Agency of the Clergy
making the Bishops the Instruments of absolute
Power, not only to ruin and destroy the Li∣berties
of the Church, but even of the whole
Country, Clergy or Laity. The Copy of this
famous Commission is among the <HI>Addenda,</HI> at
the End of this Part, <HI>No.</HI> E.</P>
<P>How they exercised this unlimited Authori∣ty,
the Histories of those Times are Witnesses,
in which whoever pleases to look, will find
the Episcopal Clergy were not backward to
merit the general Reproach cast upon Priests
of all Religions.</P>
<P>There is scarce any kind of Cruelty, Inju∣stice,
and Oppression to be named in the World,
which was not practised in the Consequence
of this Commission, upon the Ministers of the
Church; present Death, Racks, and Tortures
excepted.</P>
<P>The Ministers were beset with Spies, to ob∣serve
their Words Gestures, and their Expres∣sions
in their Prayers and Sermons, in order to
observe if they offered to speak against the new
Constitutions. They were delated or prosecu∣ted
before this Court upon so many Accounts
that it was scarce possible to avoid it; such as
speaking against the Bishops, disliking the Ca∣non
reproving Wickedness, Vices, and Immo∣ralities,
alledging they pointed at the dignified
Clergy.</P>
<P>They were delated in general upon the
Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> upon Points of Doctrine, the
Supremacy of the King over the Church, own∣ing
<PB N="167" REF="170"/>
or disowning the General Assemblies, and
the like.</P>
<P>In their appearing at their Courts, they were
insulted, brow-beaten, and maltreated by the
Bishops, neither treated as Gentlemen, as Scho∣lars,
or as Ministers of the Gospel. The Bishop
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> in particular told them, at one
of his Meetings, that he should proceed to sen∣tence
as he was directed, wherein he should
have no Regard to Wives, Children, or Estate,
which he effectually made good; and indeed
he King's Order or Letter gave them express
Encouragement to such Cruelty. It seems the
Court thought them too relax and flow in their
Proceedings, which, if our Histories are true,
there was little Reason for. But after the
first Commission had tyranniz'd about Three
Years, and the Business seemed a little to rest,
it was, on a sudden, renewed again, <HI>Anno</HI>
1619; and in <HI>November</HI> after the Bishop of St.
<HI>Andrews,</HI> sitting in Judgment upon some. of the
Ministers, pull'd out the King's Letter, written
from <HI>England,</HI> dated the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>November</HI> 1619,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>imating them to all possible Severity against
the Ministers that would not comply. This
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost merciful Letter being under the King's
most own Hand, and upon such an extraordinary
stile, cannot be omitted, without leaving this
Account imperfect: The Words, so far as re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate
to the present Case, are as follows, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>I command you, as you will be answerable to me,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>at you depose all those that refuse to conform
without respect of Persons, no ways regarding the
Multitude of the Rebellious; for that, if there be
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anting Numbers to fill their Places, I will send
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Minister<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> out of <HI>England;</HI> and I charge you
<PB N="168" REF="171"/>
to certifie us of your Proceedings, betwixt this
and the 3d of <HI>March</HI> next to come.</P>
<P>As the Bishops wanted no spurring to a Work
they so much delighted in, so they fail'd not to
proceed, in consequence of this Letter, with the
utmost Rigour; the Ministers were every where
cited, and upon their refusing to conform, were
deprived, imprison'd, put to the Horn; their
Goods plunder'd, many of then banished to the
Islands, and the like; In their Examinations,
they were used with all possible Indignity and
Contempt; and in their Imprisonments, with
Rigour and Cruelty.</P>
<P>The Laity were also fallen upon for not
kneeling at the Communion, according to the
Article of <HI>Perth,</HI> and at one Time six: of the
Citizens of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were ordered to Banish∣ment,
from their Houses, Trades, and Families,
without Trial, Citation, or Form of Process, on
Pretence that they had countenanced the Mini∣sters
in their Disobedience.</P>
<P>I might fill this Volume with the History of
these Violences, and enlarge, with great Advan∣tage,
on the unprecedented Proceedings of this
tyrannical Court of Bishops: It would also be
very diverting, as well as profitable, to record
here the Conduct of the suffering Ministers and
People, how stoutly they stood, in Defence of
their Principles, how boldly they disputed, and
often baffled and put to Shame the Bishops, e∣specially
of St. <HI>Andrews</HI> and of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> in the
Arguments they used with them; as particularly
Mr. <HI>Tho. Hog,</HI> Minister of <HI>Dysert,</HI> to the Bp. of
<HI>Glasgow</HI> and Doctor <HI>Lindsay,</HI> about the Differences
between Capping and Kneeling at the Sacraments.
The Bishop, it seems, would have proved that Cap∣ping
<PB N="169" REF="172"/>
or pulling off the Hat, and kneeling, were
synonimous; that they were not <HI>diversae species ge∣stus,</HI>
but that they who did the first, could not
refuse the last, in which Mr. <HI>Hog</HI> silenc'd them
both, and brought the <HI>Bishop</HI> to say, <HI>It is long
since I learnt my</HI> Logicks, &amp;c. Mr. <HI>Hog</HI> answered,
“There is no Difficulty here to any that are de∣sirous
to learn the sacred Truths of the Gos∣pel:
Capping, in religious Exercises, is an
outward Act of Veneration or Reverence on∣ly,
and this we do at the Sacrament; because
none can deny but that Reverence is due to
the Celebration of that solemn Ordinance.
But Kneeling, in religious Exercises, is an Act
of Adoration or Worship, which is proper to
God only, and therefore Exception is taken
at it in the Sacrament, least we seem to wor∣ship
the Elements which we receive.”</P>
<P>This was so plain that the Bishop could make
no Reply, and so broke off the Discourse; ma∣ny
such Accounts, I say, might be given, both
profitable and diverting, but the short Compass
of these Memoirs admits not to enter into those
things; it may suffice to note, that they got as
little Ground by their Violence, as they did by
their Disputations; and after all they could do
in this one Article of kneeling, tho' the King
sent down his Letter also, strictly commanding
all to kneel, yet at the Communion published in
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> for Trial of the Effect of this Com∣mand,
out of Sixteen Hundred Communicants
in the College-Church there, they could make
but Twenty receive kneeling, and the next
Day but seven, and these few were either of the
Families of the complying Episcopal-Clergy,
who administred, or the poor Alms-People,
who durst not refuse; yet they publish'd in
<PB N="170" REF="173"/>
<HI>England</HI> that the People generally complied with
the King's Command, and that only a few ob∣stinate
Presbyterian Ministers stood out, a Pra∣ctice
we see reviv'd even lately while we were
told mighty Stories of the Willingness of the
People in <HI>Scotland</HI> in Queen <HI>Ann's</HI> Time, to re∣ceive
the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and how
desirous they were to have it set up there where∣as
it since appears that it has not been receiv∣ed
any where, except where the Tyranny of
their Lairds and Superiors imposed it, and that
as soon as that imposing ceased, by the subdu∣ing
the Rebellion under the Reign of his present
Majesty, we hear no more of it.</P>
<P>The last publick Step to the confirming all
this Wreck of the Church, was the getting the
Five Articles of <HI>Perth</HI> established by the Sancti∣on
of an Act of Parliament, and so giving then
the Force of a Law; for till then they acted
meerly upon the Mandate and personal Autho∣rity
of the King.</P>
<P>The Solemnity of this Transaction was ex∣traordinary,
the Parliament met the <HI>25th</HI> of <HI>July</HI>
1621, the Ministers were carefully fenc'd against,
that none should get into the House, to protest
against it; for they knew they had a Protestati∣on
ready to deliver: Mr. <HI>David Barclay,</HI> one
of the Ministers, who resolved to present the
Protestation, got into the House to the second
Bar, but was discovered and put out again, and
at last contented himeslf to read it at the Door,
and stick it up against the Wall.</P>
<P>However, there was great Opposition to this
Act, even in the Parliament it self, but the
King, by Management of the Members, and by
the Assistance of the Bishops, got a Majority to
vote it; yet a great many, both Lords and
<PB N="171" REF="174"/>
Commons opposed It. Among the first, the
Lords <HI>Rothess, Mentieth, Eglintoun, Linlithgow,
Kintail, Gray, Ross, Yester, Cathcart, Couper, Bur∣lie,
Balmerinoch, Elpbing ston, Torphichen, and For∣bess,</HI>
all publickly voted against it. The Earls
of <HI>Mortoun, Buchan,</HI> and the Marquess of <HI>Lau∣derdale</HI>
staid without the Door, because they
would not vote for it; and of the Commission∣ers
for Shires and Burghs, Forty Four voted a∣gainst
it, besides nine Lords and Six and Twen∣ty
Commissioners that cared not to appear on
one Side or other, and came not near the Par∣liament.</P>
<P>However, notwithstanding all that could be
done, the Articles were voted, the Act pass'd,
and was published with Sound of Trumpet at
the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>20th</HI> of <HI>August</HI> 1621.</P>
<P>It is recorded by several Historians of those
Times, that when this Act, for confirming the
Articles of <HI>Perth,</HI> had been voted, and pass'd,
and was presented for the <HI>KOYAL ASSE NT,</HI>
which is signified there by touching it with
the Sceptre, the Moment the high Commissi∣oner,
the Lord <HI>Scone,</HI> stood up to touch this
Act, Heaven declared its <HI>ROYAL, DISSENT,</HI>
in a most remarkable Manner; for Three Flashes
of Lightning, one immediately after the other,
darted in at the great Window, and strook di∣rectly
in the Commissioner's Face: He confess'd
afterwards he felt the Warmth of the Fire on
his Face; the last Flash was more frightful
than the two first, and they were rendred th<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
more visible by an exceeding dark Cloud, which,
for some Minutes before, hung directly over
the City: The Thunder, which followed, and
broke upon the City, and as it were more im∣mediately
on the Parliament-House, was very
<PB N="172" REF="175"/>
terrible, especially the Third Clap of Thunder,
immediately after the Lightning: The Dark∣ness,
occasioned by the said Cloud, encreas'd to
such a Degree, that it became frightful, and
the whole was followed by so violent and so
heavy a Rain, that the like had not been known
in the Memory of Man; and the Lords and
Members of Parliament, altho' their Business
was finished, and the House broke up, were kept
prisoners by the Fury of the Rain for above
an Hour, and so long it continued, that when
they did go away, every one shifted home as
they could; so that this Act could not have
the Honour of a Procession, and to have the
Regalia carried before it, as was usual on like
Occasions. The Day got the Name of black
<HI>Saturday,</HI> upon this Account, as well as on the
Occasion of the black Work they had been a∣bout.</P>
<P>Nothing but a dark Prospect of Persecution,
and a Cloud, threatening Desolation to the Church,
now appear'd; the Prisons were fill'd with de∣priv'd
Ministers, and the remote Parts with the
Banished, and the King's Letters came every
Post pressing to more and more Severities; nay,
the Magistrates of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> were threatn'd, in
express Terms, by the King with being deposed,
and the City of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> was threatn'd with
having the Session, or Term for sitting of the
Courts of Justice, removed from them to <HI>Linlith∣go,</HI>
because they were not careful to do their
Duty, in pursuing the Ministers, and prevent∣ing
private Conventicles; for the depriv'd Mi∣nisters
preach'd in their own Houses, and Mul∣titudes
left the Churches, and flock'd to hear
them.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="176"/>
But the Hand of Heaven interposed in the
very Extremity, and by a surprizing Event
put an End for the present to the Fury of those
people; for just as the Prosecution of Mr. <HI>Wil∣liam
Rigg, John Hamilton, John Meen,</HI> and seve∣ral
other suffering Ministers was come to the
Extremity, and they were at the Point of be∣ing
sent into Banishment, an Express from
<HI>London</HI> brought the News that the King was
DEAD.</P>
<P>By this one Blow the high Commission was
dissolved of course, all Proceedings depending
before them dropp'd, and Abundance of good
Men were, for the present, delivered from the
Oppressions of the Bishops.</P>
<P>But the King being succeeded by his Son
King <HI>Charles</HI> I, who was no less zealous than,
his Father in the Episcopal Part of Church-Af∣fairs,
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> got no other Ad∣vantage
by the Change than the Stop above
mentioned, which, by that extraordinary Inci∣dent
of the Death of King <HI>James,</HI> was put to
the Persecution of the Ministers, as above.</P>
<P>On the contrary, the Episcopal Model recei∣ved
all possible Encouragement, as may be
guest by Archbishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> being made Lord
Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> till the unexpected Folly
and Madness of the Court-Party unravelled all
their own Work, and the Church rose again
upon the Ruin of her Enemies.</P>
<P>Nay, such was the signal working of di∣vine
Providence, as has been seen more than
once in the Case of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than
the Oppressions and Persecutions of this Church.
were made the Means of overturning, not the
Bishops only, who were the more immediate
Persecutors, but even the King himself, and all
<PB N="174" REF="177"/>
his Family, as will eminently appear in the
Process of the Story.</P>
<P>The King died <HI>March 27th,</HI> 1625, the first
Year of his Son's Reign appeared entangled so
many ways, that he became less intent, for some
Time, upon the Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> than his
Father had been: He was left entangled in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
War with <HI>Spain,</HI> and entred afterwards rashly
and inconsiderately into another with <HI>France;</HI>
in both which his People were uneasie, and his
Generals unfortunate.</P>
<P>The Mismanagement of the War, the indi∣rect
Methods taken by the Court for raising
Money, and the ill Usage of those, who, upon
Principles of the Peoples Liberties, opposed it
made the Parliament fall upon his Favorite the
Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> refuse Subsidies, and in∣sist
warmly on Redress of Grievances. These
put the King so out of Love with Parliaments
in <HI>England,</HI> that no Parliament was afterwards
called in Fourteen Years; during which, so ma∣ny
illegal and arbitrary Things were done, that
when the King was afterwards driven, by Ne∣cessity,
to call a Parliament, they carried their
Resentment at these illegal Practices to such a
hight as drove both Parties to Arms, and end∣ed
in the Overthrow, first of the Episcopal
People in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where the Flame first broke
out. Secondly, of the whole Establishment of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> in <HI>England.</HI> And laslty, in
the Ruin of the King, and of the Royal Family.</P>
<P>This short Digression to the <HI>English</HI> Af∣fairs
should not have been made, <HI>for I have
carefully avoided suffering these</HI> Memoirs to
<HI>pass the</HI> Tweed, <HI>except on extraordinary Oc∣casions,</HI>
had it not been to reconcile the Hi∣story
of Facts, and explain what is said above,
<PB N="175" REF="178"/>
(<HI>viz.</HI>) that the Flame of the War in <HI>England</HI>
began first in Scotland.</P>
<P>During the long interval of Parliament in
<HI>England,</HI> the King had Leisure to apply himself
to the Affairs in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and being resolved
to play <HI>Rehoboam</HI>'s Part, he met with <HI>Reboboam's</HI>
Fate: His Father had, as is said above, impo∣sed
Episcopacy upon <HI>Scotland,</HI> and a long Series
of Time had accustomed too many of the Peo∣ple
to it, or an Indifferency about it; so that
it was thought had the King sat still, he might,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n Time, have reduced the Nation at last to
have been contented with it. But far from this,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not only was not content with putting Hard∣ships
upon the Presbyterian Ministers, but
prompted, by an evil Fate, he fell upon a
Thing which, even the Episcopal People in <HI>Scot∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and</HI>
could not bear; this was imposing the
<HI>English</HI> Liturgy upon the <HI>Scots.</HI> This was not
only the most rash and impolitick Part in the
Court, but it was the most unkind and ungrate∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l
Part to his Friends in <HI>Scotland;</HI> for now the
Episcopal Party themselves, who had done eve∣ry
violent Thing he had desired for his Service,
were fallen upon, except they would comply
with the Service-Book, which Abundance of
refused. And thus he made his Friends
his Enemies.</P>
<P>This was the Project of Archbishop <HI>Laud</HI> in
<HI>England,</HI> who afterwards made <HI>L' Amende hono∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able,</HI>
for these and several other <HI>English</HI> Extra∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agances
of like Nature with the Loss of his
lead. This Bishop had introduced several No∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elties
in the Church of <HI>England</HI> it self, en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uraged
and proposed the Book of Sports, per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cuted
the Puritans, and insulted with unheard
Pride several of the Clergy of the English
<PB N="176" REF="179"/>
Church, particularly in a Visitation of his Cler∣gy,
he took upon him to remove the Commu∣nion-Table
in all the Churches, which, from the
Reformation, had always slood in the Body of
the Church, and to place it Altar-Fashion at
the upper End of the Chancel, on an Ascent,
and railed about, exactly after the Manner of
the Church of <HI>Rome.</HI> “This, <HI>says a</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whitlock'<HI>s Memoirs, fol.</HI> 24.</NOTE> <HI>learn∣ed

<P>Had he contented himself to have introduc'd
his <HI>Petty-Popery</HI> into the Church of <HI>England</HI> and
let the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> alone, his worthless
Name had had no Place in these Memoirs; but
whether put upon it by his own mischievous,
turbulent Spirit, which was always restless in
tyrannizing over others; or, as some have sug∣gested,
invited to it by some of the Prelates in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it was not long 'ere he began to in<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
termeddle with his Neighbours in <HI>Scotland:</HI> And
the Occasion seems to be as follows.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> had, says<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Coke</HI>'sDetection, Vol. 1. page</NOTE> the English Histori∣ans
had so good Success in pulling down the
Presbyterian Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and setting up
an Episcopal Hierarchy, that he had conceived
what they call, in <HI>England,</HI> a farther Reforma∣tion
of that Church, <HI>meaning the Church of</HI> Scot∣land,
by bringing them to a Conformity i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Worship, as well as in Government, to t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Church of <HI>England;</HI> and for that Purpose had
<PB N="177" REF="180"/>
ordered some of the <HI>Scots</HI> Bishops to compile a
Book or Form of Common-Prayer, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be
used in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which they did; but the Death
of that Prince, and the Opposition made to it
from the most learned even of the Episcopal
Ministers themselves in <HI>Scotland,</HI> occasioned
that no more was done in it at that Time.
This is taken from the Accounts given in our <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Histories of those Things<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Whitlock'<HI>s Memoirs, fol.</HI> 25. col. 2.</NOTE>, for the <HI>Scots</HI> ei∣ther

that Liturgy, which they did; and forming ano∣ther
out of it with several material Alterations,
and even more distastful to the <HI>Scots</HI> than the
<HI>English</HI> Liturgy it self, they advised the King
to send it down into <HI>Scotland,</HI> and to command
it to be read in all the Churches there, and that
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should be conform'd universally to as it was
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were greatly alarmed
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t this Innovation; and it is said, that se∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eral
of the Episcopal Clergy took the Free∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om
to remonstrate against it, to whose Memory
would not fail to do Justice had History re∣orded
their Names.</P>
<P>But the Bishops, and some Lords of the
Council, both approving the Design, and ha∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
received the King's positive Directions for
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> set themselves immediately to Work, to cause
his Common-Prayer-Book to be read.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="181"/>
It<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whitlock</HI>'s memoirs, fol. 25. col. 2.</NOTE> is said, that before it was admitted,
some of the Bishops in <HI>Scotland</HI> objected against
it, that tho' they liked the Book, yet they were
disgusted at its being imposed by the <HI>English</HI>
also they objected against the Translation of the
Psalms, Epistles, and Gospels, which were dif∣fering
from their Bibles; and that this, to sa∣tisfie
them, was amended.</P>
<P>Now, as if they were resolved to irritate the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> to the utmost, this Service-Book
was not only appointed to be read; but
the Minister officiating was to have on the <HI>Sur∣plice,</HI>
according to the <HI>English</HI> Custom, which
was a new and uncouth Sight to the People of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> hateful to the knowing, and next to
frightful to the ignorant well-meaning People,
and which tended to make the Thing it self, to
the last Degree, odious to the whole Nation.</P>
<P>It was first set up in the Chappel Royal at
<HI>Halyrood-House,</HI> where none being obliged to
go but the King's Servants, it being no paro∣chial
Church, it was not so offensive; for tho'
the People abhorr'd the thing it self, yet as it
was not imposed upon them, they concerned
themselves the less about it; but this was on∣ly
an Introduction to the rest, and the using i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
there was to make it a little familiar to the
Citizens, who flocked thither to satisfie their
Curiosity. But this was upon a wrong suppos∣tion,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) That as the Fox, by often seeing
the Lion, was less terrified, so the more the
people were acquainted with this Innovation, the
more they would like it; whereas on the contrary
the more the People saw this Service perform'd
<PB N="179" REF="182"/>
the more hateful and abominable it appeared to
them.</P>
<P>It was on the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>July</HI> 1637, when the
Dean of <HI>Edinburgh</HI> appointed to preach in the
great Church in that City, and resolved before
Sermon, in his Habit and Surplice, to read
the Service-Book, as he had done before in the
Royal Chappel.</P>
<P>There was a great Concourse of People in the
Church, expecting what would be the End of
this Matter, and some Guards were placed at
Hand, to prevent any Disorder in the Town;
but no one expected any Thing like that which
happened, neither could it be suspected, or was
there ever afterward any Ground to believe
that any Thing was concerted before, except
that it was in the Appointment of divine Pro∣vidence,
to bring forth what follow'd by these
unforeseen Accidents.</P>
<P>The Hour of Service being come, the Dean,
in his Surplice, comes out of the Vestry, the
people gazing as at a great Show, and making
Gestures of Contempt enough, but no Noise or
Disorder; he passes through the Croud to the
Reading-Desk, and began to read, the People
still continuing quiet, when, on a sudden, at
some Words that disgusted her, an old Wo∣man,
in a Rage, starts up, <HI>VILLAIN,</HI>
says she, <HI>dost thou say the Mass at my</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>My Ear.</HI></NOTE> LƲG,
and taking up a little Stool, which she sat on,
she drives it full at his Head, raising a most
hideous Noise in the Church by it: Some that
at next her, following her Example, did the
like, till, in a Word, the whole Church was
<PB N="180" REF="183"/>
in an Uproar, and the Dean fain to come down
out of the Desk, and pull off his Surplice, for
fear of being torn in Pieces; the Bishop of
<HI>Edinburgh,</HI> being present, went up into the Pul∣pit,
and beckning for Silence, offered to speak;
but it was all to no purpose, neither did they
spare; but Sticks, Stools, and any Thing that
came to Hand, flew at him, from all Quarters,
till at last both Bistop and Dean were obliged
to give over, and retire into the Vestry.</P>
<P>The Lord Chancellor call'd to the Magistrates,
to come down and appease the People, but it
was all ineffectual; for, by this Time, the Tu∣mult
was as great without as within, and
Showers of Stones, Sticks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> assaulted the
Church-Windows from the Street.</P>
<P>Nor did it end here; for the Multitude en∣creasing,
went to all the Churches where the
Curates had designed to read the Service-Book,
and set all in an Uproar in every Quarter of
the City.</P>
<P>The Dean and Clergy, in the great Church,
with the Magistrates and the Courtiers, having
gotten rid of the Rabble for a while lock'd
themselves in, and went on with their Liturgy
by themselves; but the Mob, who waited for
them in the Street, assaulted the Bishop as he
came out, and it was not without Difficulty
that he got safe to the Palace.</P>
<P>This was the Beginning, and at that Time
it went no farther; the Care of the Magistrates,
and Power of the Court, overawing the Croud.
But the Harvest being over, and People more at
Leisure, it was soon found that the Generality of
the Nation, as well the Gentlemen as the old
Women, were disgusted at the imposing this
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the Church and about the Mid∣dle
<PB N="181" REF="184"/>
of <HI>September,</HI> great Numbers of Gentlemen
being, with their Servants, come to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI>
a Petition was drawn up, and handed about to
be signed, requesting the Council, in their own
Names, and the Names of all the Noblemen,
Gentlemen, and others, who should agree to
the same; That the Service-Book might be no
farther prest upon them till these Things
might be represented to the King, and his Ma∣jesty's
Pleasure be farther known, An infinite
Number set their Hands to this Petition, and
among them several Gentlemen of good Rank,
and their Number encreased every Day.</P>
<P>The Council, instead of showing any Concern
at these Things, pretended to resent it to the
Gentlemen that presented the Petition, and
threatned them to give the King an Account of
their Names, as disorderly and diseffected Per∣sons,
and to take Order with them as such;
and instead of an Answer to their Address, they
published a Proclamation, to remove <HI>the Session,</HI>
that is the Term, to <HI>Linithgow,</HI> thinking there∣by
to take away the Pretence for People to
flock to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> as they usually did at that
Time on their Law-Business: They also dissol∣ved
all Meetings on Church-Affairs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This encreased the Rage of the Citizens of
<HI>Edinburgh;</HI> for the Removing the Term was a
Ruin to the City, as it hinder'd the Concourse
of People there on those Occasions.</P>
<P>The very next Day after this, the Mob ga∣thered
in <HI>Edinburgh</HI> to a prodigious Multitude,
and there is no doubt but that whatever it
was before, this-new Tumult was concerted a∣mong
those Gentlemen who had petition'd, as
above; nor was it long 'ere they publickly ap∣peared
with and at the Head of them in the Street.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="185"/>
The first Thing the People did, they surround∣ed
the Council-House, the Privy-Council be∣ing
sitting, and demanded a better Answer to
their Petition, and that the Service-Book be laid
aside till the King was fully informed of the
Matter: The Bishop of <HI>Galloway,</HI> going to the
Council, was assaulted in the Street, tho' with
Words only, and followed to the Door: The
Earl of <HI>Traquair</HI> had the same Fate, as had al∣so
the Lord Treasurer. The last was indeed
insulted particularly, and his WHITE-STAFF
taken away in the Street.</P>
<P>At the same Time another Part of the Rab∣ble
beset the Magistrates of the City and the
Town-Council, and demanded of them to join
with them in opposing the <HI>English</HI> Liturgy or
Service-Book, and threatning to pull them out
by the Heels, they obliged them to draw up a
Paper, and sign it, engaging not to permit the
idolatrous Service-Book, so they then termed it,
to be read in any Place within their Bounds,
and to recal their banished Ministers.</P>
<P>It was in vain, that the Lords, in the Privy-Council-Chamber,
sent Expresses to the Town-Council-House
to the Magistrates, to come and
rescue them; who could only make Return, by
telling, that they were in the same Condition, and
what they had been obliged to do: The Lords
had then no Remedy but to send to some of
the better Sort of those of the other Side, to
come and relieve them: Upon this Request,
several Lords and Gentlemen, of good Quality,
of those who opposed the Service-Book, came
and spoke to the People, and desired them to left
the Bishops and Lords quietly depart.</P>
<P>To these the People immediately yielded, and
they guarded their Enemies to their own House
<PB N="183" REF="186"/>
through the Rabble. And now it was easie
for them to see that the People were no more
to be imposed upon; for the very next Day a
Petition was presented to the Privy Council a∣gainst
the Service-Book: And this was not a
Petition of the Rabble; but sign'd by Nineteen
Noblemen, Three Hundred Gentlemen, of good
Note, and by the principal Inhabitants of the
City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>This Petition was sent up to the King, but no
favourable Answer was obtained; but to shew
the Resentment of the Court against the Citi∣zens
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> the Session was removed to
<HI>Sterling,</HI> by Proclamation; and another was pub∣lished,
to forbid all tumultuous Resorts or
Meetings, on Pain of Rebellion.</P>
<P>This serv'd to unite the People, who, ha∣ving
made themselves obnoxious, by appearing
in these Things, were obliged, for their own
Security, to go thorough with their Work; and
therefore taking no more Notice of the Coun∣cil
than as Enemies that did them ill Offices
with the King, and resolving to defend their
Liberties at whatever Hazard, they now began
to form themselves, and to consider their
Strength, the Generality of the Nation being
really on their Side: In the first Place, the
Earl of <HI>Hume,</HI> the Lord <HI>Lyndsay,</HI> and A∣bundance
of Lords and Gentlemen drew up a
Protestation, under their Hands, against these
proclamations, and having sent it to the Coun∣cil,
they from that, Time met in a Body, <HI>de die
in diem,</HI> to consider the State of the Nation.</P>
<P>Here the famous <HI>TABLES</HI> were formed, of
which our Histories are so full; by the Order
of which every Degree sat by themselves. (1.)
the Nobility. (2.) The Gentlemen. (3.) The
<PB N="184" REF="187"/>
Burroughs. (4.) The Ministers. And yet all
communicated their Resolves; so that every
Thing was done with Unanimity and Agree∣ment.</P>
<P>They were no sooner put into this Posture,
but being sure of the Concurrence of the Peo∣ple,
they took no Notice any more of the per∣secuting
Council; no, nor of the King himself
as to his Menaces or Missions; but taking the
Administration so far into their Hands, they
proceeded to redress the Grievances of the State.</P>
<P>They began, <HI>a Jove principium,</HI> with the Restoration
of the Church: All the Episcopal Pomp
and Ceremony vanish'd at once: The Bishop;
stood at Gaze, or fled, not daring to shew their
persecuting Faces, and the Meeting of the ge∣neral
<HI>TABLE</HI> renewed the ancient Confession of
Faith and Presbyterian Church-Government, en∣tring
into a solemn <HI>COVENANT,</HI> one with an∣other,
to defend and preserve the said Profession
of the true Protestant reformed Religion, and
likewise the Person of the King.</P>
<P>The King had a particular Account of
all these Things laid before him, and they
were let to know that his Majesty resented it
highly, which was nothing more or less than
to animate them in the Prosecution of their
New Undertaking.</P>
<P>They proceeded therefore with all the Reso∣lution
and Vigour possible, to settle and esta∣blish
the Liberties and Constitution, both of
Church and State; and that in such a Manner
as not to be again supplanted or disappointed by
their Enemies. In order to this the imprison∣ed
Ministers were every where set free, the
Banished called home, and all restored to their
Livings, to the inexpressible Joy of the people
<PB N="185" REF="188"/>
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who forbare not, upon all Occasi∣ons,
to express their Detestation of the Inno∣vations
which had been put upon them before.</P>
<P>It would take up a long History by it self
to record the restless Endeavours of the Bi∣shops,
and their Dependants; as also the Epis∣copal
Clergy in <HI>England,</HI> by any Means to bring
themselves in again; but alas! there was not
the least Room to thrust the Notion of it
into the Peoples Heads: They were every
where overjoyed to see their poor banished
Ministers return, the Church restored to her
Liberties, and to enjoy her General Assem∣blies,
regular Judicatories, publick Communions,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> without Disturbance, as before.</P>
<P>The other Party had but one Way left,
which was to provoke the King to the high∣est
Resentment, SO to embark the Power of
<HI>England,</HI> in Support of that Resentment, and
to bring down a formidable Army to cha∣stise
them as Rebels against his Royal Au∣thority.
This they threatned the Covenanters
with, <HI>so the Presbyterians were then called in</HI> En∣gland,
<HI>because of the Covenant taken, as above.</HI></P>
<P>It was certain, that a King of <HI>England</HI> at the
Head of all the Powers of that oppulent Na∣tion,
was a most formidable Thing; and as
the King had Troops ready about him, these
People perfectly naked, unprovided, undisci∣plin'd,
and the like; the Resentment of the
King was the more terrible, and it occurr'd
often from <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Words, That <HI>the Wrath of a
King is like the roaring of a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>But the covenanted Lords, far from being
dismaid at all these Threats, stood boldly to
what they had done; and when the Marquess
of <HI>Hamilton,</HI> whom the King sent to them, pro∣posed
<PB N="186" REF="189"/>
posed Two Things, their Answer will suffici∣ently
acquaint us, that they acted as Men un∣der
no Apprehensions of the Power of their
Enemies.</P>
<P>The Marquess, vested with the Power of
High Commissioner to settle the Peace, entred
into a Treaty with them on Two Heads, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<Q><P>1. What it was they expected from the King,
in Satisfaction of their Grievances.</P>
<P>2. Whether they would, after such Satisfacti∣on,
return to their Obedience, and renounce
their Covenant.</P></Q>
<P><HI>To the first they answered,</HI> They expected a
free Parliament, and a legal General Assembly
and to that they were willing to refer all their De∣mands
<HI>To the second,</HI> That they had not forsaken
their Obedience, and therefore needed no Terms of
Return; but that as to their Covenant, they would
as soon renounce their Baptism: Nor would they en∣ter
into any Treaty, if it were mentioned to them a
second Time.</P>
<P>There were long and tedious Debates be∣tween
them upon these Things, and many Ex∣pedients
the Commissioner offered, in the King's
Name, to keep, if possible, the Bishops in their
Seats. He went back to the King, return'd a∣gain
with new Concessions He offer'd a Decla∣ration
from the King, consisting of Eleven
Heads, all granting Things to the Covenanters,
which they would have rejoic'd at a little be∣fore;
but now rejected. In this Declaration.
The King granted,</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="190"/>
1. To annul the Service-Book.</P>
<P>2. The Book of Canons.</P>
<P>3. The high Commission.</P>
<P>4. The Five Articles of <HI>Perth.</HI></P>
<P>5. That all Persons, whether Ecclesiastical
or Civil, should be liable to Censure of
the Parliament and General Assembly.</P>
<P>6. That no Oath be imposed upon Mini∣sters
at their Entry; but what was
contain'd in the Act of Parliament.</P>
<P>7. That the ancient Confession of Faith
should be renewed, and subscribed as it
was in his Father's Reign, with the
Band thereto annex'd.</P>
<P>8. That a General Assembly be holden at
<HI>Glasgow</HI> the 21st of <HI>May.</HI></P>
<P>9. And a Parliament at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the <HI>14th</HI>
of <HI>May</HI> after.</P>
<P>10. That therein a general Pardon of all
Offences shall be granted.</P>
<P>11. That he will appoint a general Fast.</P>
<P>These were great Things; but as the main
Thing was left behind, <HI>viz.</HI> That Episcopacy
was left in the Church, the Bishops to remain
and to sit in Parliament, and those Things left
to the King's Nomination, which, of Right,
belong'd to the Church nothing could be done:
They protested against these Concessions, as
King-Craft, to delude them and claiming the
Right to call a General Assembly themselves,
as by Act of Parliament <HI>formerly mentioned,</HI> then
in Force: They rejected any Accommodation
without a perfect restoring the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
to all her Powers and Privileges, and the
total abolishing Episcopacy in that Nation;
choosing to run all Hazards, and to put Things
<PB N="188" REF="191"/>
to the last Extremity, rather than abate one
Tittle of it.</P>
<P>Such Zeal and such Faithfulness to the Prin∣ciple
they profess'd, could not fail to prompt
them to all proper Means to support what they
had undertaken; wherefore the Marquess of
<HI>Hamilton</HI> being gone back in Disgust, and ha∣ving
used some threatning Speeches at his part∣ing,
they resolved not to be surpriz'd; but im∣mediately
to put themselves in a Posture of
Defence, that they might be able to go tho∣rough
with what they had undertaken.</P>
<P>Accordingly they began to lay Taxes for rai∣sing
Money, gave out Commissions for levying
12 Regiments of Foot and 8 Regiments of
Horse, making iu all 18000 Men, sent over in∣to
<HI>Sweden,</HI> and the low Countries, to invite
home the old experienced Generals and Officers
of their Nation, whom they could confide in, to
come and take Pay in the Service of their
Country, and in a Word, made all necessary Pre∣parations
of War.</P>
<P>As this arming in <HI>Scotland</HI> was not without
very good Intelligence from England, of the
Resolutions taken there to reduce them by
Force, and the Threats of the Marquess of
<HI>Hamilton</HI> to their Faces, when he went from
them, who told them, insulting, <HI>That they mast
not think to use their Kings now as they did for∣merly,
when they were only Kings of Rebels; that
the King had another loyal and warlike Nation at
his Command, and that they should soon feel it to
their Cost.</HI> As, I say, these Things went before
their arming, the English Historians are mani∣festly
partial, who say the King armed only in
his own Defence, and in charging the <HI>Scots</HI>
with a Design to begin the War; it being ma∣nifest
<PB N="189" REF="192"/>
they were capable of no other Design than
of securing themselves against being trampled
on by a bigotted Court and an incens'd Clergy.</P>
<P>It is also evident, that this Vigilance was, un∣der
God, the Means of their Preservation; for
that when the King advanc'd forwards to <HI>York,</HI>
and from thence to the Border, they were rea∣dy
in the Field before him, and that with such
a resolute Countenance, as that the <HI>English</HI>
Army cared not to attack them; and when the
Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> General of the Horse to the
King, advanc'd in a Bravado with a strong
Brigade of Horse and a. Detachment of Foot, he
was driven back faster than he came, by half the
Number of the Scots Cavalry, with Musketeers in
their Intervals; a Manner of fighting which the
<HI>English</HI> had not seen, and which some <HI>Scots</HI> Of∣ficers
had learn'd under the great <HI>Gustavus A∣delplus;</HI>
it would make too much Sport with
the <HI>English</HI> Courage and Bravery, which is so
well confirmed in the World, to give an Ac∣count
how like Scoundrels this Army behaved.
An <HI>English</HI> Historian of Note says, in a Manuscript
which I have seen, they were raised by the
Clergy, and Imitated their Masters; for as the
Clergy, who prompt'd this War, accompanied
the King to <HI>York,</HI> but left him when he came
into the Field; so the raw and undisciplin'd
Army accompanied him to the Field, but left
him when they should have engaged; in a Word,
none of the Troops, after the first Skirmish,
car'd to engage, or to look the <HI>Scots</HI> in the Face;
who, on the other Hand, tho' they would not
attack the King, yet stood ready, and shewed
all the Forwardness in the World to give Battle.</P>
<P>The King's Generals finding the Disposition
of their Men, told the King very plainly, it
<PB N="190" REF="193"/>
was not his best Way to engage: Upon which
Notice was given the <HI>Scots</HI> Army, that they
might send some to treat with his Majesty up∣on
their Demands, which was done, and in
which, all possible Artifice was used to make
superficial Agreement, that the <HI>Scots</HI> might be
obliged to disband, and so might be surpriz'd
again unarm'd.</P>
<P>However, they made a Pacification, and ac∣cording
to the Terms they broke their Army;
but having certain Intelligence from <HI>England,</HI>
of the treacherous Design, they kept the Officers
and Generals in Half-pay a Practice to this
used when Nations put an End to a War with no
very great Assurances of preserving the Peace.</P>
<P>As they had been inform'd, so it prov'd;
for the King, fired by the Clergy, fought Oc∣casions
of new Quarrels, and declined establish∣ing
their Civil and Ecclesiastick Liberties ac∣cording
to their Model, and then pretending
the <HI>Scots</HI> had not kept their Articles, denounced
them Rebels both in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>This obliged them to restore their Troops,
with all possible Expedition, and so soon were
they completed, the Zeal and Alacrity of the
common People furnishing Men even faster than
they required, that they were in the Field 20
Days before the King: And now they used no
more Ceremony about advancing beyond their
own Borders, <HI>as before;</HI> but finding no Army rea∣dy,
they entered <HI>England</HI> in Order of Battle, and
advanc'd to <HI>New-Castle upon Tyne,</HI> before any E∣nemy
appear'd.</P>
<P>Here the Royal Army fac'd them, and it was
thought impossible the <HI>Scots</HI> should pass the
<HI>Tyne,</HI> without fighting; but General <HI>Lesly,</HI> an
old Soldier, resolving to put it to the Issue of
<PB N="191" REF="194"/>
a Battle, pass'd the River at <HI>Newbourn,</HI> in the
Face of a strong Body of the <HI>English</HI> Army; beat
them fairly by plain Fighting from their Post,
and killed 300 of their Men; which Action so
frighted the King, and his whole Army, that
they would not strike a Stroke more; but
shamefully retreated to <HI>York,</HI> leaving <HI>New-Castle</HI>
and <HI>Durham</HI> in Possession of the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>Here began the <HI>English</HI> Troubles and Civil
War, which, as they belong not to our Story,
I shall mention no farther than to make good
what I observ'd before, <HI>viz.</HI> That God so or∣dered
it even from the Beginning of the Refor∣mation
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that no Men, or Party of
Men, have ever yet fallen upon the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> but it has been at length their own
Destruction; the Church has been like the Stone
in the Gospel, and on her religious Establish∣ment
may be written, as is upon her Banners,
<HI>Nemo me impune lacessit.</HI> Ever may it be so,
and may her Enemies take the Warning, that
they never more make the Attempt.</P>
<P>Now the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was arriv'd to
her full grown State indeed: Her Enemies were
not only subdued, but all in her Power her As∣semblies
were now reviv'd, the Covenant which
bad been the Band of all this Steadiness, was re∣newed,
all her Church-Judicatories were resto∣red,
Episcopacy was entirely abolish'd, and all
her Persecutors fled; for Fear of falling into the
Hands of that Justice which they had before
exercised to Tyranny and Oppression.</P>
<P>A few Words will finish this Part of her
Story; The King, and his High-Church Army
being retreated, after the Action at <HI>Newbourn,</HI>
it is impossible to express the Consternation they
were in: The <HI>Scots</HI> Army being advanc'd to
<PB N="192" REF="195"/>
<HI>Durham,</HI> were now entire Masters of <HI>England;</HI>
If they had pleased to advance, nothing could
have stood before them. They were entirely
possess'd of all the Counties of <HI>Northumberland,
Cumberland,</HI> and <HI>Durham,</HI> and began to extend
themselves towards the <HI>West,</HI> and as they re∣ceived
daily Supplies of Men from <HI>Scotland,</HI> they
would, in Six Days more, have been possess'd
of <HI>Westmoreland</HI> and <HI>Lancashire,</HI> there being no
Forces to oppose them but at <HI>York,</HI> and those
under the terrible Appreherision of being at∣tacked
by bur whole Army, which, God and
a just Quarrel being on the <HI>Scots</HI> Side, they
were in no Condition to oppose.</P>
<P>The King, in the utmost Distrest, here sum∣moned
a great Council of his <HI>English</HI> Nobility
to consult what to do; they advise him to what,
for 14 Year, had been his Aversion; namely,
the calling a Parliament, and to send to the <HI>Scots</HI>
to treat of a second Pacification, which they,
in the greatest Prosperity of their Affairs, rea∣dily
consent to: This was the famous Treaty
of <HI>Rippon,</HI> where, granting a Cessation of Arms,
contrary to the Practice of all victorious Armies,
rating their Contributions that the Country
might not be oppress'd, and limiting their Ar∣my
to the Banks of the River <HI>TEES,</HI> they sat
still, waiting upon Providence, and to see what
would be the Issue of those great Things which
were then in view.</P>
<P>I mention this as it concurs with what is ob∣serv'd
before, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That this arming in Scot∣land
had nothing in it of what the Enemies of
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> charg'd upon them, <HI>viz.</HI>
Of a Design against either the Person or Go∣vernment
of their Prince; but was nothing
more or less than what the evident Necessity of
<PB N="193" REF="196"/>
their Circumstances led them to, in Defence of
their Civil and Religious Rights, which were
illegally overthrown by their Enemies; which
Enemies had sollicited a <HI>FOREIGN AID; for
such even their own King, at the Head of the</HI> En∣glish
<HI>Forces, was;</HI> to subdue and destroy them;
nor was their Practice in this Case any thing
but what has been practised and allowed to
be agreeable to the Laws of Nature, and of our
Country, by both Nations, on several Occasi∣ons,
less urgent than this, as will, in Part, ap∣pear
in this Account.</P>
<P>It remains only to observe, that on the Meet∣ing
of the Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> being
fairly treated with, their just Demands granted,
and afterwards confirm'd, they quitted <HI>England</HI>
in <HI>August</HI> 1640; intermeddled not then with the
Quarrels and Divisions which, from that Time,
began to encrease; but retir'd within their own
Borders, and laid down their Arms, till the Flame
of Civil War, which afterwards broke out in
<HI>England,</HI> involv'd them of Course in the Share
of it, which they felt to their great Loss and Op∣pression,
on many Accounts.</P>
<P>But the Story of those Things not relating to
the Church-Affairs, I pass over, referring to the
Histories of both Nations. I have only to con∣clude
this Part with saying, that from this Time
to the Restoration of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, the Church
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> being uninterrupted as to her Eccle∣siastick
Jurisdiction, subsisted in her full grown
State; enjoying the full Liberty of her Constitu∣tion,
both in Worship, Discipline, and Govern∣ment:
In Civil Affairs, their Country was often
involv'd in War and Confusion enough; but as
to the Church, which is the proper Business of
this Tract, it suffer'd no considerable Interrupti∣on.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="197"/>
Her next Appearance will be a State of Trial
the Return of her implacable Enemies the Bi∣shops
and their Hierarchy, where we shall see her
again overwhelmed in Blood, and Suffering the
most cruel and merciless Persecution that ever
Protestant Church endured: Her Neck being for
Eight and Twenty Years continually under the
Feet of Tyranny and Oppression.</P>
<Q>CONCLUSION.</Q>
<P>From this whole Account, this just Observati∣on
presents it self to our View.</P>
<P>1. That as the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> reform'd
at first from Popery into Presbyterianism, so
when the Invasions of Episcopacy, supported by
the Tyranny of Princes, had reduced her to the
lowest Ebb, yet whenever the Hand of Tyran∣ny
was taken away, and the People of <HI>Scotland.</HI>
were left to the Freedom of their own Choice in
Matters of religious Worship, they never fail'd to
demonstrate, that Episcopacy was their Aversion;
and that they still retain'd a sincere Affection to
the Model of their first Reformers; that the
Presbyterian Church was truly National, and
that they would always, by their Choice, em∣brace
the same, both in Doctrine, Discipline
Worship, and Government.</P>
<P>2. That Episcopacy never got Ground in Scot∣land,
but by Violence; and never fail'd to exercise
what Power it had there, to oppress and destroy its
Opposers; being always animated with a Spirit
of Persecution in the Church, and absolute Ty∣ranny
in the State, as will still more fully appear
in that Part of this Work which is still behind.</P>

<P>“Brethren, understanding the Procced∣ings
of the Assembly in my contrare, and
being now withholden by Sickness, to pre∣sent
my self before you, that I may give
Confession of that Doctrine, wherein I hope
God shall call me, and that at his Pleasure I may
depart in the Unitie of the Christian Faith; I
thought good by Writ to utter the same unto
your Wisdoms, and to crave your godly Wis∣dom's
Assistance, not for the Restitution of any
worldly Pomp or Preeminence, which I little
respect; 5 but to remove from me the Slanders,
which are raised in this Country, concerning
<PB N="197" REF="200"/>
the Variance of Doctrine, specially on my part;
wherein I protest before God, that I have only
a single Respect to his Glorie, and by his Grace
I shall abide herein to my Life's End.”</P>
<P>“First, confess the true Doctrine of Christian
Religion to be publickly taught, and rightly
announced within this Realm, and detest all a∣pistrie
and Superstition; like as (blessed be God)
I have detested the same in my Heart the
Space of Thirtie Years, since it pleased God to
give me the Knowledge of the Truth, wherein I
have walked uprightly, as well here, as in other
Countries, as the Lord beareth me Record; un∣till
these last Days, wherein, partly for Ambi∣tion
and vain Glory, to be preferred before my
Brethren; and partly for Covetousness, to pos∣sess
the Pelf of the Kirk, I did undertake
this Office of Archbishoprick, wherewith just∣ly
the sincerest Professors of the Word have
found Fault, and have condemned the same, as
impertinent to the Office of a sincere Pastor of
God's Word. And albeit Men would colour the
same, and the Imperfections thereof, by divers
Cloaks; yet the samine cannot be concealed
from the Eyes of the Faithful; neither yet can
the Men of God, when they are put to their
Conscience, dissemble the same.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Next,</HI> I confess I was in an erroneous Opini∣on,
that I believed the Government of the
Kirk to be like unto the Kingdoms of the
Earth, plain contrary to the Command of our
Master <HI>Christ</HI> (as it is;) but also in Ministers,
who are nothing, but Vassals under him in an
Equality among themselves.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Thirdly,</HI> That I married the Earl of <HI>Huntlie,</HI>
contrair the Commandment of the Church,
without the Confession of his Faith, and Pro∣fes<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="198" REF="201"/>
fession of the sincere Doctrine of the Word, I
repent and crave God Pardon.”</P>
<P>“That I travelled both by reasoning, and o∣therways,
to subject Kirkmen to the King's
Ordinance, in Things that appertained to Ec∣clesiastical
Matters, and Things of Conscience;
whereupon sundrie great Enormities have fallen
forth in this Country, I ask God Mercie.”</P>
<P>“That I taught, Presbyteries to be a foolish
Invention, and would have had it so esteemed
of all Men, which is an Ordinance of Christ, I
crave God Mercie.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Farther,</HI> I submit my self to the Mercie of
God, and Judgment of the Assemblie, not mea∣suring
my Offences by my self, nor Infirmities
by my own Ingine, but by the good Judgment
of the Kirk, to which always I subject my
self, and beseech you to make Intercession to
God for me, and to the King, that I may have
some moyen to live, and consume the rest of
my wretched Time, for winning of whose Fa∣vour
(which foolishly I thought thereby to
obtain) I committed all these Errors.”</P>
<P>“Whereas I am burdened to be the Setter
forth of the Book, called <HI>The King's Declaration,</HI>
wherein the whole Order of the Kirk is con∣demned
and traduced, I protest before God,
that I was commanded to write the same by the
Chancellor for the Time, but chiefly by the Se∣cretar,
another great Courtier, who himself
penned the second Act of Parliament, concern∣ing
the Power and Authority of Judicature to
be absolutely in the King's Power; and that it
should not be lawful to any Subject to reclaim
from the same, under the Penaltie of the Act,
which I suppose was Treason.</P>
<P>“<HI>Item,</HI> Where it is alledged, that I should have
<PB N="199" REF="202"/>
condemned the Doctrine, announced and taught
by the Ministrie of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> concerning Obe∣dience
to the Prince, I confefs and protest be∣fore
God, that I never understood, nor yet
knew any Thing, but Sinceritie and Upright∣ness
in the Doctrine of the Ministers of <HI>Edin∣burgh</HI>
in that Point, or in any other.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Farther,</HI> I consess I was the Author of the
Act discharging the Ministers Stipends, that
would not subscribe the Acts of Parliament,
wherewith God had justly recompenced my self.”</P>
<P>“As for any violent Course, it is known well e∣nough,
who was the Author thereof, and my
Part was tried at the Imprisonment of Mr.
<HI>Nicol Dalgleish,</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Melvine,</HI> Mr. <HI>Tho∣mas
Jack,</HI> and others.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Moreover,</HI> I grant I was more busie with
some Bishops in <HI>England,</HI> in Prejudice of the
Discipline of our Kirk, partly when I was
there, and partly by mutual Intelligence since,
than became a good Christian, much less a
faithful Pastor. Neither is there any Thing
that more ashameth me, than my often decei∣ving
and abusing of the Kirk heretofore, by
Confessions, Subscriptions, Protestations, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
which be far from me now and ever hereafter.
<HI>Amen.</HI>”</P>
<Q><L>“Your Brother in the Lord</L>

<P>“Where your Wisdomes desire to have my
own Opinion, concerning the Book of the De∣claration
of the King's Intention; the same is
at more length declared in the Confession,
which I have exhibited already, wherein I have
condemned all the Articles therein contained;
like as by these Presents I condemn the same.”</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="203"/>
“Where you require, what became of the
Books of the Assemblie? I reserved them whole,
until the returning of the Lords and the Mini∣strie
out of <HI>England;</HI> and if I had not preserved
them, my Lord <HI>Arran</HI> intended to have made
them to be cast in the Fire. And upon a cer∣tain
Day in <HI>Falkland,</HI> before they were deliver∣ed
to the King's Majesty, the Bishop of <HI>N.</HI> ac∣companied
with Mr. <HI>Henry Hammiltoun,</HI> rent
out some Leaves, and destroyed such Things as
made against our Estate, and that not without
my own special Allowance.”</P>
<P>“As for the Books which I have set forth, I
have set forth nothing, except a Commentary
upon the first Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> which
shall be directed to the King's Majesty, and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Exemplar beside me; and I under∣stand
that Mr. <HI>John Geddie</HI> got the same from
the King, and lent it to Mr. <HI>Robert Hepburn▪ ”
“Farther,</HI> I wrote nothing, but only made
mention, in my Preface upon the <HI>Apocalypse,</HI>
that I should write a Book called <HI>Psillus,</HI> which
(being prevented by Disease) God would not
suffer me to finish, and the little Thing that
was done I caused destroy it. I have set forth
the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and the <HI>Lamentations</HI> of <HI>Jere∣mie,</HI>

<P>“As for my Intention, I am not disposed, nor
of Abilitie to write any Thing at this Time;
and if it please God I were restored to my
Health, I would change my Stile, as <HI>Cajetanus</HI>
did at the Council of <HI>Trent.</HI>”</P>
<P>“As for <HI>Sutlivius</HI>'s Book against the Form
and Order of the Presbyteries, so far am I
from being Partner in that Work, that as I
know not the Man, nor had ever Intelligence
of the Work, before it was done; so if it

please God to give me Days, I will write in
his contrarie.”</P>
<P>“Prays the Brethren to be at Unitie and Peace
with me, and in Token of their Forgiveness,
because my Health suffereth me not to go over
to the Colledge, where ye are presently assem∣bled,
which I would gladly do, to ask God and
you Forgiveness, that it would please you to
repair hither, that I may do it.”</P>
<P>“Moreover I condemn, by this my Subscripti∣on,
whatsoever is contained in the Epistle De∣dicatorie

<Q><HI>Mr.</HI> Patrick Adamson<HI>'s own Answer to and Refu∣tation
of the Book, salfely called,</HI> The King's
Declaration.</Q>
<P>“I have enterprised of meer remorse of Con∣science,
to write against a Book, called, <HI>A De∣claration
of the King's Majesty's Intention;</HI> albe∣it
it containeth little or nothing of the King's
own Intention, but my own at the Time of the
Writing thereof, and the corrupt Intentions of
such as for the Time were about the King, and
abused his Minoritie. Of which Book, and
Contents thereof, compiled by me at the Com∣mand
of some chief Courtiers for the Time
(as is before written) I shall shortly declare my
Opinion, as the Infirmity of Sickness, and
Weakness of Memory will permit.”</P>
<P>“<HI>First,</HI> in the whole Book nothing is contained,
but Assertions of Lies, ascribing to the King's
Majesty that whereof he was not culpable:
For albeit, as the Time went, his Majesty
could have suffered these Things to have been
published in this Realme; yet his Majesty was
never of that Nature, as to have reviled any
<PB N="203" REF="206"/>
Man's Person, or to upbraid any Man with
Calumnies, whereof there is a Number con∣tained
in that Book.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Secondly,</HI> In the Declaration of the <HI>second</HI> Act
of Parliament, there is mention made of Mr.
<HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> and his Preachings, most
wrongfully condemned, in special as factious
and seditious; albeit his <HI>Majesty</HI> hath had a
lively Trial of that Mans Fidelity and Truth,
in all Proceedings from Time to Time. True
it is, he is earnest and zealous, and can abide
no Corruption (which most unadvisedly I at∣tributed
to a fiery and salt Humour) which his
Majesty findeth by Experience to be true. For
he allowed well of him, and knoweth Things,
that were alledged upon him, to have been
false and contrived Treacheries.”</P>
<P>“There are contained in the <HI>second</HI> Act of Par∣liament,
and Declaration thereof, diverse o∣ther
false Calumnies, to defame the Ministrie,
and to bring the Kirk of God in Hatred and
Envy with their Prince and the Nobility, bur∣dening
and accusing falsely the Ministers of Se∣dition,
and other Crimes, whereof they were
innocent. As likewise it is written in the same
Act and Declaration thereof, that sovereign
and supream Power, in Matters Ecclesiastical,
pertaineth to the King; which is worthy to be
Condemned, and not to be contained among
Christian Acts, where the Power of the Word
is to be extolled above all the Power of
Princes, and they are to be brought under Sub∣jection
to the same.”</P>
<P>“The <HI>fourth</HI> Act condemned the Presbyteries,
as a Judgment not allowed by the King's Law,
which is a very slender Argument. For as con∣cerning
the Authority of the Presbyterie, we
<PB N="204" REF="207"/>
have the same warranted in the Gospel, <HI>Matth.
Ch.</HI> 18. where Christ commanded to tell the
Kirk. Which Authoritie being commanded
by Christ, and the Acts of Parliament forbid∣ding
it, we should rather obey God than Man.
And yet the Presbyterie wanted never the
Kings Authoritie for Allowance thereof from
the Beginning; saving only at that Hour of
Darkness, when he was abused with evil Com∣panie.
As for any other Thing that is contain∣ed
in this Act, against any Order or Proceeding
of the Presbyterie, it is to be esteemed, that no∣thing
was done by the Presbyterie without Wis∣dom,
Judgment, and Discretion; and so hath
received Approbation again by the Kirk,
whereunto also I understand his Majesty hath
given Allowance, hath ratified and approved
the same, which should be a sufficient Reason
to repress all Mens Curiositie, that either have,
or yet would find Fault with the same.”</P>
<P>“The <HI>last</HI> Act containeth the establishing of a
Bishop, which hath no Warrant in the Word
of God, but is grounded upon the Policie of
Man's Invention, whereupon the Primacie of
the <HI>Pope</HI> or <HI>Antichrist</HI> is risen, which is worthie
to be disallowed and forbidden: Because the
Number of the Eldership, that hath Jurisdicti∣on
and Oversight, as well of Visitation, as of
Admission, will do the same far more authen∣tickly,
godly, and with greater Zeal, than a
Bishop, whose Care commonly is not upon God
and his Dutie, but upon the World, whereupon
his chief Attendance is. Consider how that
Office hath been used, these Five Hundred
Years bygone, with what Crueltie and Tyran∣nie
it hath been exercised; ye shall find it to
<PB N="205" REF="208"/>
have been the chief mean, that hath in every
Countrey suppressed the Word of God; which
shall be evident to all that read the Storie of
the Kirk. As for my own Opinion, it seem∣eth
to be nearest to the Truth, and farthest
from all kind of Ambition, that the Brethren
in equal Degree assemble themselves under the
Head Christ, and there every Man discharge
his Office carefully, as he is commanded. And
because Weakness of Memorie and Sickness suf∣fereth
me not at length to discourse upon these
Matters, as I would, I must request the good
Reader to assure himself, that I have written
these, without Compulsion or Persuasion of any
Man, with an upright Heart; and have deli∣vered
the same with perfect Sinceritie of Mind,
so far as Infirmitie of Flesh and Blood did suf∣fer,
as God shall judge me at the latter Day:
And that the same Reader account, that what∣soever
Things are omitted, is to be imputed to
the Imbecillitie of my Memorie, and the present
Sickness; and not to any good Will, which, I
protest, was to have condemned every Point, yea
even to the false Narration of the Banquet, and
all the rest contained in the little Treatise call∣ed,
<HI>The Declaration of the King's Majesty's In∣tention,</HI>
as I acknowledge they deserve to be
condemned by the Censure and Judgment of
the Kirk, to the which also I submit my
self, in whatsoever Thing, I have either in
Word or Writ attempted in that foresaid De∣claration,
or otherways. By these Presents

<P>Here follows the Account which the Epis∣copal
Party themselves give of the Proceedings
of the <HI>Scots</HI> Bishops and Presbyterian Ministers,
<HI>mentioned in this Work,</HI> before the King at <HI>Ham∣pton-Court.</HI></P>
<P>“The first Audience was at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> the
22 of <HI>September;</HI> at which, besides the Bishops
<PB N="207" REF="210"/>
<HI>and Ministers from</HI> Scotland, <HI>were present the
Earls of</HI> Dunbar, Argyle, Glencarne, <HI>Sir</HI> Thomas
Hamilton <HI>Advocate, and Sir</HI> Alexander Straiton:
<HI>Of the</HI> English <HI>Dr.</HI> Montague <HI>Dean of the Chap∣pel
was only admitted to stay: There the King
declaring the Purpose for which he had called
them, spake a few Words to this Effect:</HI> That
having left the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in Peace at his
parting forth of it, he did now hear of great Di∣sturbances
in the same; whereof he desired to un∣derstand
the true Cause, and to have their Ad∣vice,
how the same might be removed. This being,
<HI>said he,</HI> the Errand in general for which I have
called you, I should be glad to hear your Opinions
touching the Meeting at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> where an
Handful of Ministers, in Contempt of my Authori∣ty,
and against the Discharge given them did as∣semble;
and though they were neither a suffcient
Number, nor the accustomed Order kept, they
would take upon them to call it a General Assembly,
and have since proudly maintained it by declining
my Council and such other Means as they pleased to
use. The rather I would bear your Minds, because
I am informed that divers Ministers do justifie that
Meeting, and in their publick Preachings commend
these Brethren as Persons distressed, which in Effect
is to proclaim me a Tyrant and Persecutor.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>James Melvill</HI> answering first, said,
That there was no such Discharge given to
those Ministers that met at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> as was
alledged, adjuring Sir <HI>Alexander Straiton,</HI> who
was said to have given the Charge, to declare
in his Majesty's Presence how that Matter
was carried. As to the Absence of Modera∣tor
and Clerk, he said, that none of these were
essential Parts of an Assembly, and that the
Moderator absenting himself of Purpose and
<PB N="208" REF="211"/>
the Clerk refusing to serve, the Brethren
conveened might lawfully create others in
their Places, so as the Ministers having War∣rant
to conveen from the Word of God, and
from his Majesty's Laws, as also coming thi∣ther
by Direction of their Presbyteries, he
could not in his Conscience condemn them.”</P>
<P>“Well then, <HI>said the King,</HI> I shall desire you to
answer me Three Things, that I will ask: First,
if it be lawful to pray publickly for Persons con∣victed
by the lawful Judge as Persons being incom Di∣stress,
and afflicted? 2. Whether I may not be∣ing
a Christian King, by my Authority Royal, con∣vocate
and prorogue, and desert for just and neces∣sary
Causes known to my self any Assemblies or
Meetings within my Dominions? 3. Whether or
not may I by my Authority call, and conveen before
me and my Council, whatsoever Person or Persons,
Civil or Ecclesiastical, for whatsoever Offences
committed by them in whatsoever Place within my
Dominions, and if I may not take Cognition of
the Offence, and give Sentence therein? And fur∣ther,
whether or not are all my Subjects being cited
to answer before me and my Council, obliged to
compeir and acknowledge me or them for Judges in
these Offences?”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>James</HI> answering, said that the Questions
were weighty, and craved a great Deliberati∣on;
wherefore he would humbly entreat his
Majesty to grant them a Time to confer and
advise together, that they might all give one
direct Answer. This Desire granted, they
were commanded to advise and meet together
that Night, and be ready to answer the next
Day. At this Meeting the Earls of <HI>Salisbury</HI>
and <HI>Northampton,</HI> with divers of the <HI>English</HI>
clergy were present. The Ministers desiring
<PB N="209" REF="212"/>
to have the Meeting move private, requested
the Earl of <HI>Dumbarre</HI> to move the King therein;
and that none but <HI>Scotsmen</HI> should be present;
<HI>fearing</HI> (as they said) <HI>that some unseemly Words
might escape them.</HI> But this was denied, and
they warned to speak with that Respect which
became Subjects. It was believed that the King
should have begun with the Questions proponed
in the former Meeting, but his Majesty taking
another Course, required them to declare one
by one, their Judgments touching <HI>Aherdeen</HI>
Assembly. The Bishops (being first ask'd) did
all condemn the Meeting as turbulent, factious,
and unlawful.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvill</HI> then being enquired
made Answer,” “That he could not condemn
the Assembly, being a private Man; that he
came into <HI>England</HI> upon his Majesty's Letter,
without any Commission from the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> and though he had Commission <HI>in di∣cta
causa,</HI> and not hearing what they could
say for themselves, he could not give his
Judgment; Sentence he said was given against
them in a Justice-Court; how justly, he did
remit that to the great Judge; but for him∣self
he would lay as our Saviour did in another
Case, <HI>Quis me constituit judicem?”</HI></P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>James Balfoure</HI> being next asked,” “Did
pray his Majesty not to press him with any
Answer, for that he knew nothing would be
well taken, that proceeded from his Month,
and that Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> had answered his Mind
sufficiently.”</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>James Melvil,</HI> without giving a direct
Answer, began to tell,” “That since his coming
to <HI>London</HI> he had received divers Letters, and
with them a Petition, that mould have been
<PB N="210" REF="213"/>
presented to the late Parliament in behalf of
the warded Ministers, which he was desired to
offer unto his Majesty, and as he thought, the
Petition would make all their Minds known.”</P>
<P>“The King taking the Petition and falling to
read the same, willed the Advocate to go on
and receive the Answer of the rest. And as the
Advocate was questioning Mr. <HI>William Scot,</HI> and
urging him with a distinct Answer (for he used
many Circumlocutions, according to the Cu∣stom)
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvill</HI> in a great Passion said,
<HI>That he followed the Instructions of Mr.</HI> John Hamil∣ton
<HI>his Ʋncle, who had poisoned the North with
his Papistry, and that he was now become</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>Northampton</HI> asking what he
meant by that Speech? The King said, he
calleth him, <HI>the mickle Devil:</HI> And then fould∣ing
up the Petition, said, <HI>I see you are all set for
maintaining that base Conventicle of</HI> Aberdeen?
<HI>But what Answers have you to give to the Questi∣ons
I moved?</HI> it was answered,” “That they had
conferred together, and finding them to con∣cern
the whole Church, they would not by
their particular Voices prejudge the same.” <HI>But
“you will not I trust,</HI> said the King, <HI>call my Autho∣rity
in Question, and subject the Determination of
the same to your Assemblies.</HI>” “This they said
was far from their Thoughts, but if his Maje∣sty
should be pleased to set down in Writing
what he required, they should labour to give
him Satisfaction.”</P>
<P>“Thus were they dismissed for that Time, an
being the next Day called before the <HI>Scottish</HI>
Council (for after this they were no more ad∣mitted
to his Majesties Presence) they were en∣quired,
whether they had in their publick
Prayers prayed for the warded Ministers, as
<PB N="211" REF="214"/>
Persons <HI>afflicted, and Sufferers for God's Cause?</HI>
Some of them confessed that they had <HI>prayed for
them, as Persons in Trouble, and Distress:</HI> Others,
that they had <HI>commended them to God, but re∣memberd
not in what Words.</HI>”</P>
<P>“The 20 of <HI>October,</HI> they were again brought
before the <HI>Scots</HI> Councill, and had the Three
Questions delivered to them in Writing;
which they were commanded to answer several∣ly:
Mean while they were discharged to return
into <HI>Scotland</HI> without his Majesties License, and
prohibited to come towards the Queen and
Princes Court. The Bishops and others of the
Clergy that assisted them, were permitted to

<P>Here follows the Account which the Presby∣terian
Party give of the same Conference, extra∣cted
from the Memorials of some of the Persons
present, and from <HI>Calderwood</HI>'s History of the
Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>“Upon the 22d of <HI>September</HI> they were sent
for to the King, and when they came, they
were admitted to the Chamber of Presence,
where they were courteously received by the
Bishop of <HI>Canterbury.</HI> The King came to the
Chamber of Presence, accompanied with the
Earls of <HI>Dumbar</HI> and <HI>Orknay,</HI> Lord <HI>Fleeming,</HI>
the Laird of <HI>Laurestoun,</HI> Sir <HI>Thomas Hamil∣toun</HI>
the King's Advocate, Mr. <HI>John Spotswood</HI>
Bishop of <HI>Glasgow,</HI> Mr. <HI>George Gladstones</HI> Bi∣shop
of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Law</HI> Bishop
<PB N="212" REF="215"/>
of <HI>Orknay,</HI> Mr. <HI>James Nicolson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Robert
Howie,</HI> Mr. <HI>Patrick Sharp,</HI> Mr. <HI>Andrew Lamb.</HI>
None were suffered to stay within, but the
<HI>Scotish</HI> Counsellors and Ministers, except only
that of <HI>Montague,</HI> who keeped the Door. The
King opened up the Causes, which moved him
to write for them, almost conform to the
Tenor of the Proclamation, and the Missive
sent unto them. In end, he gathered all his
Speeches to two Heads, wherein he said, he
would be through with them for the Peace
of the Church. The one about the pretend∣ed
General Assembly (so he termed it) hol∣den
at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the Proceedings, which
followed thereupon. The other, how there
might be an ordinary and peaceable Assembly
holden, to set all Things in Quietness and
good Order. They had agreed among them∣selves
to give no present Answer, but to take
all to Advisement. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> was
chosen to be their Spokesman. After he had
expressed, in a complementing Manner, their
Joy for his Inclination to intertain Peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
he desired Time to advise; because his Maje∣sty's
Letter did bear no Particular, neither
heard they of any before that Time. There∣after
there was much Time spent, upon send∣ing
of Commissioners from Presbyteries, after
receiving of his Majesty's Commissioners Let∣ter,
discharging any Assembly to be holden
at <HI>Aberdeen. Item,</HI> upon the Proceedings of
the Synod of <HI>Fife;</HI> praying for the convicted
Brethren in Prison; and upon Mr. <HI>James Mel∣vin</HI>'s
Letter directed to the Synod of <HI>Fife.</HI>
For the present they answered thus much:
Many of the Presbyteries had not received Ad∣vertisement
before the Day; these who had
<PB N="213" REF="216"/>
received, considering that there were weighti∣er
Reasons for holding the Assembly, than
for deserting of it, resolved to send their
Commissioners to keep the Day appointed by
his Majesty the Law standing, which is the
most authentick Testimony that a King can
give, as his Majesty himself declared in open
Assembly holden at <HI>Dundie:</HI> For the Enemies
were bold and busie: Many References, Ap∣pellations,
and other Matters were lying not
taken Order with, which could not be order∣ed
without a General Assembly. The great∣est
Motive was a Fear to lose the Right and
Possession of a General Assembly, which would
expire of it self, if there were not a set Day
appointed. The Words of the Letter, sent
by the Synod of <HI>Fife</HI> to other Synods, were,
in their Judgment, so conceived, that it could
neither prejudice the General Assembly, nor
his Majesty's Royal Power, nor the Brethren
who were in Ward under his Majesty's Mer∣cy.
They confessed, they prayed for the im∣prisoned
Brethren; and professed, they could
not omit that Duty to their Brethren, which
was extended even to Malefactors for their
Amendment. As for Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI>'s Let∣ter,
the King said, I heard, Mr. <HI>James,</HI> you
wrote a Letter to the Synod of <HI>Fife,</HI> holden
at <HI>Couper,</HI> where there was much of Christ,
and little good of the King. By God, I
trow, ye were raving or mad; for ye speak
otherwise now. Was that a charitable Judg∣ment
ye had of me? <HI>Sir,</HI> said Mr. <HI>James,</HI> I
was both sore and sick in Body, when I wrote
that Letter; but sober and sound in Mind.
I assured my self, and the Brethren, that these
Articles, a Copy whereof came in my Hands,
<PB N="214" REF="217"/>
could not come from your Majesty, they were
so strange. Sundry of the Bishops and Com∣missioners
of the General Assembly, that were
present, confessed, that many wrong Copies
were sent abroad, and some very odious,
whereof one might have come in Mr. <HI>James</HI>
his Hands. The King, resuming the first two
Heads, willed them to advise upon an An∣swer,
against the next Day.”</P>
<P>“They were scarce entred into their Lodging
at <HI>Kingstoun,</HI> when they received a Letter
from Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay,</HI> Secretary for the
<HI>Scotish Affairs,</HI> warning them in the King's
Name to come to Sermon to morrow. So up∣on
<HI>Tuesday</HI> the <HI>23d</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> they went
to <HI>Hampton-Court,</HI> and sat in the Place ap∣pointed
for them in the Chappel, the King
and Queen being present. Doctor <HI>Buckerage</HI>
taught upon <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1. He joined Pope and
Presbyteries together, diverse Times, as Ene∣mies
to the King's Supremacy.”</P>
<P>“After Dinner, they resolved upon this An∣swer
to the first Head, which they appointed
Mr. <HI>James Melvin</HI> to deliver. They could not
judge of the Assembly of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> for these
Reasons. 1. His Majesty had indicted by Pro∣clamation
a General Assembly, wherein his
Majesty expected a Reparation of all Disor∣ders,
in so far as belongeth to the Censures of
the Church. If they should now condemn, or
resolve, having committed such a Prejudice,
they could not be heard. They called to Re∣membrance
his Majesty's Practice, at the As∣sembly
holden at <HI>Montrose,</HI> where the Com∣missioners
of <HI>Lothian</HI> and <HI>Merce</HI> were reject∣ed,
upon the like Ground. 2. <HI>Res non erat in∣tegra,</HI>
but judged already by the Council: But
<PB N="215" REF="218"/>
they would be loath to contradict. 3. The
Judgment thereof could not appertain to them:
<HI>Nam quis constituit cos judices?</HI> 4. Put the Case
they could be Judges, and that the Matter
might be committed to them, they could not
do it <HI>indicta causa, &amp; reis non citatis nec au∣ditis.</HI>
But the King took another Course,
which was to pose every one in particular,
and so to catch Advantage, if it were possi∣ble.”</P>
<P>“The Ministers were sent for after Dinner.
The Prince stood at the King's left Hand,
with the abovenamed <HI>Scotish</HI> Noblemen, Coun∣sellors,
Bishops, and Commissioners of the Ge∣neral
Assembly. The Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury</HI>
stood at the King's right Hand, the Earls
of <HI>Salisbury, Suffolk, Worcester, Nottingham,
Northampton,</HI> Lord <HI>Stennop,</HI> Lord <HI>Knolles,</HI> and
sundry other Noblemen. Some Bishops and
Deans stood at the Door, behind the Tape∣stry,
who now and then discoverd themselves.
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> desired the Earl of <HI>Dum∣bar,</HI>
to request his Majesty that the <HI>English</HI>
might be removed, lest his Majesty should of∣fend
at any Thing spoken in a homely Man∣ner
in their Presence: But it was not granted.
The King, after returning of the Points left the
last Day, came at last to be resolved in this
Particular; whether the Assembly holden late∣ly
at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> was a lawful Assembly, or not?
And whether the Proceedings of the Ministers
at it, and afterward, were justifiable, or not?
Mr. <HI>George Gladstones, John Spotswood, James
Law, Andrew Lamb,</HI> Bishops; Mr. <HI>James Ni∣colson,
Patrick Sharpe, Robert Howie</HI> and <HI>Lau∣restoun</HI>
were first asked, and answered, they
ever damned that Assembly, and the Proceed∣ings
<PB N="216" REF="219"/>
of these Brethren, as unlawful. Then
the King demanded at Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin,</HI>
what say ye; whether think ye, that where
a few Number of Eight or Nine do meet,
without any Warrant, wanting the chief
Members of an Assembly, as the Moderator
and Scribe, conveening unmannerly without
a Sermon, being also discharged before by o∣pen
Proclamation, may make an Assembly, or
not? He answered to the first Objection thus;
That in an Assembly of the Servants of Christ,
whereof the Number is not prescribed by a
Law, it is not lawful for any to disallow there∣of
for the Number, seeing two or three (which
is the smallest Number) conveened in the
Name of Christ, have the Promise of his Pre∣sence,
who is their Lord and Ruler. Beside,
Rareness maketh not Unlawfulness in an or∣dinary
Meeting, established by Law and Pra∣ctice.
Lastly, all that was done, might law∣fully
have been done by a fewer Number, au∣thorized
with Commission, as they were: For
Continuation requireth not full Conventions.
As for their Warrant. 1. They have War∣rant
from God's Word. 2. Your Majesty's
Laws. 3. Their Presbyteries sent them in
Commission to that Effect; and therefore ap∣proved
the prorogating of the Day; which
was all they did: And therefore these Presby∣teries
were to be blamed, if any thing was
done amiss; and not the Persons, who were
Executors only of their Presbyteries Will and
Commission. To the <HI>Second</HI> he answered, that
the Absence of a Moderator and Clerk were
not <HI>de essentia Synodi:</HI> And therefore the one,
to wit, Mr. <HI>Patrick Galloway▪</HI> the Moderator of
the former Assembly, absenting himself; the
<PB N="217" REF="220"/>
other, to wit, Mr. <HI>Thomas Nicolson</HI> being pre∣sent,
but craving Leave to be absent for that
Time, because of his weighty Affairs, they
might create others in their Places, according
to the Practice of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
is to be seen in the Register of the General
Assembly. To the <HI>Third</HI> he answered, his
Majesty was misinformed: For the ordinary
Pastor of <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> to wit, Mr. <HI>James Ross</HI> had
a Sermon before the Meeting. As for the pre∣tended
Charge, given the Night before, turn∣ing
himself to <HI>Laurestoun,</HI> he said, I adjure
thee, in the Name of the Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as
you will answer before the great God, in the
Day that Christ shall appear to judge the
Quick and the Dead, to declare the Truth,
and to tell, whether there was any such Charge
given, or not. <HI>Laurestoun</HI> answered not one
Word. Then the King asked, what Reasons
he had not to condemn the Ministers. He an∣swered,
if it please your Majesty to hear, I
have these. 1. I am but a private Man, come
upon your Majesty's Letter, without any Com∣mission
from the Church of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and
therefore, seeing <HI>nemo constituit me judicem,</HI> I
cannot take upon me to condemn them. 2.
Your Majesty, by Virtue of your Proclamati∣on,
dated here at <HI>Hampton-Court</HI> (which he
then produced) hath remitted their Trial to
the General Assembly, expecting Reparation
of wrongs, if any be done: I cannot therefore
prejudge the Church and Assembly of my
Vote there, which if I give now, I shall be
sure to have my Mouth shut up then, as by
Experience I and other Brethren have found
before. 3. <HI>Res est hactenus judicata</HI> by your
Majesty's Council, whether rightly, or not,
<PB N="218" REF="221"/>
that I remit to the Lord the Searcher of all
Hearts, before whom one Day they must ap∣pear,
and answer for that Sentence: Shall I
then take upon me to contradict your Maje∣sty's
Council, and their Proceedings? I think
your Majesty would not be well content with
it. <HI>Lastly,</HI> how can 1 condemn them <HI>indicta
causa,</HI> not hearing their Accusers objecting
against them? This was the Substance of his
Answer, which he uttered after his own Man∣ner,
roundly and freely. Mr. <HI>James Balfour,</HI>
standing next in Order, was urged to declare
his Mind. He answered in Effect as mr. <HI>An∣drew</HI>
did. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> answered; their
Proceedings are already censured by your Ma∣jesty
and Council, wherein I am resolved with
the Peril to obtemperate, either by Obedience
or Patience. If your Majesty be pleased to have
it farther judged by an Assembly of the Church,
which is our Wish, I cannot prejudge the
Judgment of the Church. If in the mean
Time your Majesty will urge me to deliver
my Judgment of the Matter, according to my
Conscience; unless the Wrongs done to them,
and given in Writ to your Majesty's Estates,
at the last Parliament holden at <HI>Perth,</HI> be con∣sidered
and discussed, I would not for all the
World condemn them. A Copy of the
Wrongs we have earnestly desired of them∣selves,
that we might present them to your
Majesty, with this he stepped forward, and
delivered them to the King in his Hand.
While the rest were sporting, the King read
them over, and smiling in discontented Man∣ner,
he said, he was glad they were given in.
Mr. <HI>Robert Wallace</HI> followed. He regrated
some Delations that were given in against him,
<PB N="219" REF="222"/>
and then answered as the former did. Mr.
<HI>William Watson</HI> was sharp against <HI>Laurestoun,</HI>
and laid the Burden of all upon him: But he
never replyed one Word. Mr. <HI>William Scot</HI>
delivered his Judgment in few Words, agree∣able
with these that preceeded. The Advo∣cate
craved Licence of the King to deal with
him: But Mr. <HI>William</HI> had the upper Hand to
his Shame. Because much Time was spent,
Mr. <HI>John Carmichael</HI> and Mr. <HI>Adam Colt</HI> were
desired to be short. They answered in few
Words, conform to the rest. Their Harmo∣ny
moved the <HI>English</HI> and others to Admira∣tion.
In end Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvin</HI> brake out,
in his own Manner, and plainly avowed the
Innocency of the Brethren, in all their Pro∣ceedings
at <HI>Aberdeen.</HI> Thereafter he recount∣ed
the Wrongs done to them at <HI>Linlithgow,</HI>
whereof he was an Ear and Eye-Witness. He
laid to the Advocate's Charge his favouring
and sparing of Papists, his crafty and malici∣ous
dealing against the Ministers. So that
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> could not have done
more against the Saints of God, then ye did
at <HI>Linlithgow</HI> against the Ministers. Ye would
do God and his Majesty better Service, my
Lord, if you bended your Forces and Speech∣es
against your Uncle Mr. <HI>John Hamiltoun</HI> a
seminary Priest, and Mr. <HI>Gilbert Broun,</HI> Ab∣bot
of <HI>Newabbay,</HI> who have infected a great
Part of the Country with Popery. But these
Mens Heads ye have clapped, and shut up the
faithful Servants of Christ in Prison; and still
ye shew your self possessed with the same
Spirit: For ye think it not enough to have
pleaded against them in <HI>Scotland,</HI> with all the
Cunning and Skill ye had, but still continue
<PB N="220" REF="223"/>
<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. At which Words the
King turning him about to the Archbishop of
<HI>Canterbury,</HI> said, what is it he saith? I think
he is calling him out of the Revelation <HI>Anti∣christ;</HI>
nay, by God, he calleth him the very
Devil. Well bourded, Brother <HI>John,</HI> said the
King. In end he demanded, what Overture
they would give him for the other Point.
They answered, their best Overture was to
have a free General Assembly, by which all
Jars would be removed, and quickly quieted.
The King riseth, and they were dismissed,
not without great Applause of the <HI>English,</HI>
for their Gravity and Boldness in the Cause
of God. The Truth was cleared unto them,
which before was obscured by Misreports.
What was omitted by one, was remembred by
another, every one of them having a pretty
Space to advise upon his Answer.”</P>
<P>“When the Ministers were gone out of the
Palace, and a little on their Way to <HI>King∣stoun,</HI>
Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay</HI> sent for them, read∣eth
to them a Charge from the King, not to
return to <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor to come near the <HI>King's,
Queen's,</HI> or <HI>Princes</HI> Court, without special Li∣cence
and calling for.”</P>
<P>“Upon the 24. of <HI>September,</HI> M. <HI>Alexander Hay</HI>
willed them to return to Court with all conve∣nient
speed. When they came, he shewed to
Mr. <HI>James Melvine,</HI> that he was directed by his
Majesty to crave his Subscription to the Sheet
of Paper, which was given-in by him to his
Majesty concerning the Cause, and Manner of
the Delivery. So he gave him it to peruse,
which being done Mr. <HI>James</HI> wrote the An∣swer,
and Manner of the Delivery of them in
the Kings Hand. Within an Hour after, the
<PB N="221" REF="224"/>
Earle of <HI>Glencarne</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Gordoun</HI> came
to them, directed from the King, desiring
their Answer in Writ, and subscribed, to his
Question; what the King may do in Matters
Ecclesiastical? And whether or not he had
wholly the Power of conveening and discharg∣ing
of Assemblies? They craved the Question
to be set down in Writ, and subscribed as
from his Majesty, and sufficient Time to ad∣vise,
and so the Matter deserted at that
Time.”</P>
<P>“Upon the 28. of <HI>September,</HI> they were again
written for to come to Court. The End was
to hear Doctor <HI>Andrews</HI> Bishop of <HI>Excester,</HI>
who, teaching upon the <HI>Tenth</HI> of <HI>Numbers,</HI>
discoursed upon the Two Trumpets, and pro∣ved,
as he could, the conveening and dis∣charging
of Councils and Assemblies to belong
to Christian Kings and Emperours.”</P>
<P>“At Supper, they were again warned to be
at Court, the Day following by Eight a Clock;
because the <HI>Scotish</HI> Council was to deal with
them. But when they came, they were will∣ed
by the King's express Command, to come
to the King's Chappel, namely Mr. <HI>Andrew
Melvine</HI> and Mr. <HI>James Melvine.</HI> Mr. <HI>James</HI>
warned Mr. <HI>Andrew</HI> by the Way, that they
were to be trapped, and to have their Pati∣ence
tried. There they saw the King and
Queen offer at the Altar, whereupon were set
Two Books, Two Basons, and Two Candle∣sticks
with Two blind Candles. This was a
Day solemnly keeped, in Honour of St. <HI>Mi∣chael.</HI>
A <HI>German</HI> being present, said, <HI>ego nun∣quam
vidi talem cultum: nihil hic prefecto deest
de solenni missa, praeter adorationem consecrati pa∣nis.</HI>
Upon the Occasion of this Solemnitie,
<PB N="222" REF="225"/>
Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> made the Epigram, for
which he was afterward troubled.”</P>
<P>“That Day afternoon, the Earles of <HI>Argile
Glencarne, Orknay, Wigtoun, Dumbar,</HI> the Com∣ptroller,
the Advocat, the Abbot of <HI>Lindorse</HI>
Mr. <HI>Peter Young,</HI> the Laird of <HI>Kilsyth</HI> conveened,
in the Earle of <HI>Dumbar</HI>'s Lodging. When the
Ministers compeared, <HI>Dumbar</HI> shewed unto
them, that it was his Majesty's Will, that the
Council there conveened should deal with
them severally, and crave their Answer to
certain Heads, whereunto they prayed them
to give clear Answers, for Satisfaction of his
Majesty, and to go forth, and come in, as they
were called on. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> was first
called on, and being demanded by the Advo∣cat,
1. Whether he prayed for the impri∣soned
Brethren? 2. Whether he allowed the
holding of the Assembly at <HI>Aberdeen,</HI> and the
Declinature given in to the Council by them
who held it? 3. Where was his Letter, writ∣ten
to the Synod of <HI>Fyfe,</HI> &amp;c. He answered, I
am a free Subject of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
which hath Laws and Priviledges of their own,
as free as any Kingdome in the World, to
which I will stand. There have been no Sum∣mons
lawfully execute against me. The No∣blemen
here present, and I, am not in our own
Countrey. The Charge <HI>super inquirendis</HI> was
declared long since to be unjust. I am bound
by no Law to accuse my self, neither to fur∣nish
Dittay against my self. He desired the
Noblemen present to remember what they
were; and to deal with him, howbeit a mean
Man, yet as a free borne <HI>Scotishman,</HI> as they
would be content to be used themselves, that
is, according to the Lawes of the Realme of
<PB N="223" REF="226"/>
<HI>Scotland.</HI> The Advocat notwithstanding urg∣ed
him to answer, with whom he interchan∣ged
some sharp Speeches; and told him, that
howbeit he had not studied the Lawes, as he
had done, yet he had learned his Logick, and
taught it in the Schooles. Will ye not daigne
his Majesty with an Answer? said <HI>Dumbar.</HI>
With all Reverence, said Mr. <HI>James,</HI> if I
might know the Question, and have Time to
advise upon a good Answer. Ye shall have
that, said <HI>Dumbar;</HI> and desired him to give
in his Supplication, which the Ministers im∣prisoned
had sent to the King, which Mr.
<HI>James</HI> delivered unto him, and intreated him
to present it to the King, and to assist it. He
was removed, and the rest were called on by
Course. At last Mr. <HI>Andrew Melvine</HI> was call∣ed,
and told them plainly, they knew not
what they were doing; they had degenerated
from the ancient Nobilitie of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who
were wont to hazard their Lives and Lands,
for the Freedom of their Countrey, and the
Gospel, which they were betraying and over∣turning.
Night drawing on they were dis∣missed.”</P>
<P>“Upon the <HI>Thirty</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> they were a∣gain
called on to Sermon. Doctor <HI>King</HI> had a
most virulent Invective against the Presbyteries,
crying to the King, <HI>down, down with them.</HI>”</P>
<P>“Upon the <HI>Second</HI> of <HI>October,</HI> the Eight Mini∣sters
were again called before the <HI>Scotish</HI> Coun∣cellours.
Three Articles were delivered to
them in Writ, whereunto they were called to
give Answer in Writ, every one of them seve∣rally;
and to take as much Time to advise, as
they pleased, and indeed the chief Drift was
to drive Time, till the Convention at <HI>Linlith∣gow</HI>
<PB N="224" REF="227"/>
were past. It was permitted to them to
go where they pleased, provided they went
not far from Court, and made the Place of
their Abode known, that they might be found,
when it pleased his Majesty. The Tenor of
the Articles, subscribed by Mr. <HI>Alexander Hay,</HI>
here followeth.”</P>
<P>“1. Whether they had not transgressed their
Dutie, in making publick Prayers for the Bre∣thren
in Ward, as being afflicted: And are
willing to crave his Majesty's Favour for the
same; seing their said Brethren abide in ward
for just Causes, and by a just Sentence of a law∣ful
Judge, standing unquarrelled and unreduc'd?”</P>
<P>“2. Whether they acknowledge his Majesty by
the Authoritie of his Prerogative Royal, as a
Christian King, to have lawful and full Power
to convocat, prorogat, and cause desert, upon
just and necessare Causes known to him, the As∣semblies
of the Kirk, within his Majesty's Do∣minions.”</P>
<P>“3. If his Majesty by his Authoritie Royal,
hath not sufficient and lawful Power to call,
and conveen before him and his Councel,
whatsoever Person or Persons, Civil or Ecclesi∣astical,
for whatsoever Faults, and give Sen∣tence
thereanent? And it all his Majesty's
Subjectes be astricted to compear before his
Majesty and Councel, to answer, acknowledge
and obey his Majesty and Councels Judgment,
in the said Offences? 2. <HI>October</HI> 1606.”</P>

<PB N="225" REF="228"/>
<P>“Upon the <HI>Fourth</HI> Of <HI>November,</HI> Mr. <HI>William
Scot</HI> and Mr. <HI>John Carmichael</HI> went to <HI>Westmin∣ster,</HI>
and conferred with Mr. <HI>James Nicholson,</HI>
whom they found to be a Man far changed, and
resolved to accept the Bishoprick of <HI>Dunkelden,</HI>
bought to him by the King from Mr. <HI>Peter
Rollock</HI> for Twenty Thousand Pounds. They
delivered to him their Answers to the Three
Articles, and with all their Grievance, which
the King desired them to give-up. They a∣greed
in Substance; howbeit some were more
ample than others. Mr. <HI>James Melvine</HI> an∣swered

erroneous in Religion, or scandalous in Life, not only
discouraged the Ministry from censuring of Vice; but

the established Order of the Kirk, or against any of the
Conclusions of the bypast General Assemblies, or in
favour of any of those, who are banished, warded, or
confined for their contemptuous Offences; which being
no Matter of Doctrine, and so much idle Time spent
without Instruction of their Auditorie in their Salva∣tion,
ought so much the more severely to be punished;
<PB N="231" REF="234"/>
in Regard that they are Ministers, who of all others
should spend least idle Talk, and specially in the Chair
of Veritie: And therefore after the calling of them
before the said Commissioners, they are to be question∣ed
and tried upon the Points of that which is laid a∣gainst
them, and punished according to the Qualitie
of their Offence: And whereas Complaint shall be
made unto them by any Partie, that shall be conveen∣ed
before any Ecclesiastical Judicatorie, for any such
Crime as he shall be then suspected of, or that the Par∣tie
doth alledge always the Matter it self to be im∣proper

been informal, or that the Judicatorie it self hath

any just Cause, they are then to take Trial and Cogni∣tion

<HEAD>OF THE
CHURCH
IN HER
PERSECTED STATE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">B</SEG>Ishop <HI>Spotswood</HI> in his History of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
says, That the <HI>PERSECv;TION</HI>
of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> was a great means to
farther the first Propagation of the
GOSPEL in <HI>Scotland;</HI> which
Persecution being but in the <HI>South</HI>
Parts of <HI>BRITAIN,</HI> it brought a great many
<HI>CHRISTIANS,</HI> as well <HI>Preachers</HI> as <HI>Pro∣fessors,</HI>
into <HI>Scotland,</HI> where they were kindly
received by King <HI>Cratilinth,</HI> and the Isle of <HI>Man</HI>
given them for their Retreat, where he erected
a magnificent Church, and called it, <HI>THE
TEMPLE OF OƲR SAVIOUR.</HI>
This is said by be in the Year, 277.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="237"/>
Like Instances might be found in all the
Tracts of Antiquity from thence to the present
Time, where <HI>Persecution</HI> has spread and establish'd
the <HI>True Religion;</HI> but no where so eminently, as
the <HI>Perseeutions</HI> of <HI>PRESBYTERIANS</HI>
has done in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>It was with Respect to the several Troubles,
Divisions, Wars, and Interruptions, which the
Establishment of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> met
with, even in her most flourishing Condition,
that the last Part of this Work was call'd, <HI>The
growing Estate of the Church,</HI></P>
<P>I would have been very well pleased to have
call'd it, <HI>The compleat, or finish'd State,</HI> and to
have represented the Church in the Perfection of
her Desires, arriv'd to the Top of her own Views,
and in the full Enjoyment of her just Privileges,
supported by her own Power, and the Majesty of
her Constitution.</P>
<P>But the Divine Wisdom which has always
thought fit to exercise his Church with Tribu∣lation
and Affliction, as the best Foundation
whereon to build her temporal Establishment,
had otherwise determin'd; and all that Strength
which the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> had gain'd in the
short Intervals of Peace which she had enjoy'd,
in the last Period of her Circumstances, was
little enough to carry her thro' the fiery Tryal
she had now to endure.</P>
<P>No sooner was the Restoration of K. <HI>Charles</HI> II.
brought to pass in <HI>England,</HI> but the Enemies of
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> began to lift up their
Heads, and the black Cloud which did but ho∣ver
over them as it were for a while, and
threaten'd them with Destruction, being big
with Storms and furious Thunders, broke upon
them all at once.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="238"/>
There had some Things pass'd in the <HI>English</HI>
Parliament, which had deeply affected the Peo∣ple
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had given them a clear View
of what they were to expect, tho' it was not yet
fallen upon them., and this is what I mean by
the black Cloud which hover'd over them for
a while.</P>
<P>These were (1) The declaring the <HI>Solemn
League and Covenant</HI> to be unlawful, and obliging
all People who held any Office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to subscribe
to the said <HI>Declaration, 13 Car. 2, cap.</HI> 1. (2) The
Act of <HI>Ʋniformity,</HI> and by which the Episcopal
Hierarchy in <HI>England</HI> was restored, and the Mi∣nisters
who would not conform to the Liturgy
and Ceremonies of the Church of <HI>England</HI> before
<HI>Bartholomew</HI> Day, 1662, were depriv'd of their
Livings, 13 <HI>Car. 2, cap.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>These were Preludes to what was to be ex∣pected
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and yet albeit, the Acts in
<HI>England</HI> were made before those in <HI>Scotland,</HI> yet
the Privy Council or Council of State in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
took upon them to begin with the <HI>Presbyterians</HI>
as soon, or rather sooner, than the Parliament in
<HI>England</HI> began there: So that the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> saw early what they had to expect; and
thus we are led, without any other Need of In∣troduction,
into the History of Fact.</P>
<P>When the King was restor'd, the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> was in its best and fullest Possession of
Legal Power. The Professors of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI>
Doctrine, had by their Adherence to the Royal
Family, laid in as good a Loan of Obligation
upon the Generosity of the King, as any Party in
their Circumstances could have done: And if
but the Interest of that Debt had been paid, or,
if Gratitude had been the Fashion of the Times,
they had some Reason to expect a little Con∣sideration
to be had for them.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="239"/>
It was indeed upon some Expectation of such a
Return, that immediately, on the first News of
the King's Restoration, the Ministers in Conjun∣ction
with some of the Nobility and Gentry, re∣solv'd
to present a Paper to him, which was
called, <HI>A Monitory Supplication.</HI> It was a new
Term, perhaps, made for the Occasion: And
they did the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> much Wrong, who told
King <HI>Charles,</HI> that it was a <HI>Minatory Supplication;</HI>
for the Contents of it prove the contrary, which
are too long for the Brevity of this Tract, but
in a Word, is contained as follows,</P>
<Q><P>I. A very hearty and solemn Congratulation
of his Majesty's Restoration to the Throne
of his Ancestors, recognizing his Right, and
extolling the Goodness of God, in returning
him to his People, praying, that it may be
a Blessing to his Majesty and the whole Na∣tion,
and alluring him of their ready and
dutiful Submission to his Authority.</P>
<P>II. Reminding his Majesty with great Humi∣lity
of his COVENANT Engagement,
<HI>mark that,</HI> to God, and the Nation, and his
solemn Promises to put forward the <HI>Work of
REFORMATION</HI> in the Kingdom, as
the <HI>only</HI> Thing in which his Majesty might
expect the Blessing of God upon his Reign
and upon his People.</P></Q>
<P>This <HI>Supplication</HI> was never presented, nay,it
was not sign'd by many of the Persons who had
promoted and recommended it: But while it was
a meer Embrio the Council of State sent
their Officers, and as if it had been an Act of
Rebellion, surpriz'd and seiz'd upon such as they
<PB N="141" REF="240"/>
had Information were concerned in it, and clapt
them in Prison, having no other Pretence against
them but this <HI>Supplication,</HI> which they told them,
was seditious, and tended to disquiet the Minds
of the Leiges, and render his Majesty's Govern∣ment
uneasie to them. Most of those they seiz'd
upon were Eminent Ministers.</P>
<P>It was alledged by the Persons that were thus
taken up, <HI>That there was ho Law against suppli∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing
their Prince, and that where there was no Law
there could be no Transgression; that they had not
acted unpeaceably or undutifully to his Majesty in any
Thing, and desir'd to know upon what Law they were
committed to Prison:</HI> The Council let them know,
no other Law at that Time but their Arbitrary
Pleasure, against which the poor Gentlemen had
no Remedy but Submission.</P>
<P>And this was the first Article of Persecution
in that Reign (<HI>viz.) Imprisoning without a Law,</HI> a
Thing they reduc'd into a most general Practice
presently after.</P>
<P>The Government themselves acknowledged
the Injustice of this afterwards by procuring an
Unrighteouss Law, to be made to take away the
Subjects Liberty of Petitioning the Sovereign,
declaring it Unlawful and Seditious, <HI>Vid. 2 Sess.</HI>
of the 2d parliament of King <HI>Charles 2. Act.</HI> 2.
by which Act, even Prisoners were deny'd the
Liberty to Petition for their Deliverance; nay,
or a Condemned Person for his Pardon, or his
Life; a cruelty scarce heard of in any Nation
before; which made many good People after∣wards
endure the most intollerable Cruelties in
their Imprisonment, for fear of having them
Doubled by the Crime of Petitioning for Mercy:
But this was but the beginning of the Afflicti∣ons
of the Church of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="241"/>
In the beginning of the Year 1661. the First
Parliament of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Sate down, and
that they might lay a Ground Plot of that
Bloody Persecution, which they had resolv'd to
raise, so they immediately applied themselves
to make such Laws, and make void such already
made, as they well knew would be intollerable
to the <HI>Presbyterians:</HI> They knew, the <HI>Presby∣terians</HI>
would neither obey the one or bear the
other, and consequently would render them∣selves
obnoxious to the Penalties and Punishment
of those Laws, and give the People in Power a
sufficient Pretence for falling upon them, with all
that Violence and Inhumanity, which they had
resolv'd to treat them with.</P>
<P>To bring the Account into some Method, it
will be needful at once to give a Detail of these
Persecuting Laws, as they came to be made, or
at least of so many of them, as were made upon
these Occasions: And this I shall do in Order
to enter into the History of the Suffering of
the People in the Consequence of those Laws,
the more regularly: And this Method I shall
repeat again, as other and subsequent Laws
were made for the like purposes.</P>
<P>Some of the several New Laws, made after
the Restoration, which were the beginning of
the persecution were as follows.</P>
<P>1. Act Imposeing the Oath of Supremacy: This
was directly contrary to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Principle.</P>
<Q><HI>Note,</HI> This was the very first Act pass'd after
the Restoration, and it was call'd the Oath
of Allegiance, only to render the refusing
it the more odious, but it contained also
the Oaths of Supremacy in express Words,
and without the Antient Limitations for∣merly
granted. 1. <HI>Act. 1. Par.</HI> K. <HI>Char.</HI> 2.</Q>
<P><PB N="143" REF="242"/>
2. Act Obliging all People in Office, to ac∣knowledge
the Prerogative o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f the King, Note,
this was in such Terms, as they had then ad∣vanc'd;
above and against all former Engage∣ments,
and which they knew Conscientious
People could not comply with.</P>
<P>3. Act Declaring Void, and Dissolving the
Obligation of the Solemn League and Covenant.
This the Nation having Sworn to, the good
People could not be convinc'd, that an Act of
Parliament could dispence with the Obligation
of their Oath, in the Sight of God; and there∣fore
chose Death, rather than comply with it,
<HI>Par. 1. Sess. 1. Act. 11. Car.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>4. Act Declaring the National Covenant, to
be an Unlawful Oath, and that the same is not
of any Force to bind those that have taken it.
<HI>Par.</HI> 1. Sess. 2. <HI>Act. 2. Cha.</HI> 11.</P>
<P>5. An Act not of Parliament, but of Coun∣cil,
to burn both the said Covenants, by the
Hand of the common Hangman.</P>
<P>6. Act to restore Episcopacy in <HI>Scotland:</HI>
Striking at the Root of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church,
and Overthrowing all the Settlement and Esta∣blishment
of the said Church at one blow.</P>
<P>First Act of the Second Session of the first
Parliament of King <HI>Charles 1. Anno</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>It may be truly said, that some of these Actscere
not only surpriz'd the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> but even
fill'd the whole Nation with Horror, partly at
the Unheard of Attack made upon the Solem∣nity
of the National Covenant, which most People
there Esteem'd Sacred, and wondred how their
Temporal Power, or indeed any Power upon
Earth could take upon them to Discharge the
Pepole of the Obligation of an Oath; and partly
<PB N="144" REF="243"/>
at the Dreadful Things, which they evidently
foresaw would be the Consequence of such Pro∣ceedings.</P>
<P>It is not my business here to enter into the
Question, whether the Parliament could dispence
with the Obligation of this Oath or no, much less
will I offer, till I see the Affirmative better proved,
to Condemn the Opinion of those, who think
the Nation of <HI>Scotland</HI> guilty by that Act of a
most horrid National Perjury.</P>
<P>Having gone this length on the one Side, let
us see what Course the poor People took, who
were to suffer for the least Step they took in
Opposing these furious Proceedings.</P>
<P>The first Thing I find which the Government
laid any hold on, was the Ministers Preaching
against them: This was the least Thing they
could expect, and yet for some Time was the
greatest Opposition they met with, and which
way to deal with this they hardly knew; for it
would seem exceeding Tyrannical, to Attack
the Ministers for Words spoken in their Pulpits,
which it would be hard to ascertain, and against
which there was yet no Law: Besides having put
so many hardships already upon them, it seem'd
very unlikely, but these losers would have
leave to speak, and very hard to deny it.</P>
<P>But they soon got over this: and being re∣solv'd
to use no Ceremony, but to faill upon the
Kirk by all the violent Methods they could De∣vise,
they published a Proclamation, <HI>Discharge∣ing</HI>
as they call it, that is, prohibiting and for∣biding
<HI>Every one to speak against the Proceedings of
the State.</HI></P>
<P>This open'd a Door to fall upon the
Ministers, for many of them being Zealous for
the Reformation, and for the Covenant, which
<PB N="145" REF="244"/>
they believed was an <HI>Oath of God,</HI> and could
not be Dissolv'd by Man; could not therefore
in Conscience but declare against the Attempt
made in the aforesaid Law, to set up the Power
of Man, to dispe<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se with the Authority of God:
For maintaining this and opposing the Act of
the Kings Supremacy, a Thing which they
believ'd was no less than a Rebellion against the
Regal Authority of Christ Jesus, the only Head
and Government of his Church; Many of the
Ministers were Imprison'd, and some without
Hearing, or leave given them to make their De∣fence
were <HI>Indicta Causa,</HI> Sentenc'd to Banishment.</P>
<P>The Number of these was Seven at one Time,
they were not indeed sent or Transported to any
particular Place into Slavery, as was afterwards
practised. But they were obliged by Sentence,
to quit the Country in a certain Time, upon
pain of Death, and never to return upon the
like Penalty; and accordingly they took Ship∣ping
for <HI>Holland,</HI> to the great Grief of their
Flocks, who mourned for the loss of them▪
being left destitute as Sheep without a Shepherd;
but one was singled out from the rest to bear his
Testimony against them, in another manner; this
was Mr. <HI>James Guthrie</HI> the <HI>Proto-Martyr</HI> of this
Persecution, who was Condemn'd to Death, and
accordingly was Hang'd at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> as a Tray∣tor;
whose Behaviour during his Imprison∣ment
and Tryal, before those Tyrannical
Judges, and afterwards at the place of Execu∣tion,
might have convinc'd them, that the
Blood of these Men, would be the Seed of the
Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and that Torments and
Death, would not weaken the Cause of Religion
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> or advance them one step towards
the Conquest they aim'd at.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="245"/>
Having now Tasted Blood, their Fury seem'd
to encrease, and now in Consequence of the Act
for restoring Prelacy mention'd before, they
advanc'd such Principles as they knew were di∣rectly
contrary to the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Doctrine, and
such as they knew no Bonds, no Affliction, no
nor Death it self, would ever bring them to
comply with.</P>
<P>These were,</P>
<P>1. A Declaration in the Preamble to the Act
for Establishing Episcopacy, signifying, that <HI>the
Disposal of the Government of the Church, is in
the King, as an Inherent Right of the Crown.</HI></P>
<P>2. Depriving the Church of the Freedom of
Calling and Chusing their own Pastors: This was
included in an Act for restoring Patronages.</P>
<P>3. Dispossessing the Ministers, who would not
Conform to Episcopocy, and this without Legal
Prosecution, by a meer Act of Council, pas'd in
<HI>October,</HI> 1662.</P>
<P>I think it is very necessary to set down these
first Measures of the Persecutors of the
Church, in Order to remove a certain Slander
raised by the Enemies of these poor Suffering
Christians, and which too many good People
are Prepossess'd in this Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that the
<HI>Scots Presbyterians</HI> suffer'd upon Trifling Pun∣ctilio's,
not Essential to Religion, or upon
Points which the Christian Church have in all
Ages submitted to, even under the Government
of Heathen Emperors and the like; such as ac∣knowledging
the King, Swearing Allegiance to
him, living peaceably, paying Taxes, Tythes,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> Whereas on the contrary it is Evident,
that the Sufferings of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and the Persecution which her Faithful Confes∣sors
<PB N="147" REF="246"/>
have Labour'd under, have been occasion'd
for maintaining the Essential Points, both of
Doctrine and Government, which she has held
ever since the Reformation, and without which
no true Church can be Established, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Such
as the refusing all Usurpations upon the Sove∣reignty
of Christ, as King and Head of his
Church, in Opposition to Erastianism, and E∣piscopal
Supremacy. (2.) The Insupportable
Yoke of what they call'd Unscriptural Prelacy,
which neither they or their Fathers were able
to bear. (3.) The right of calling their own
Ministers in Opposition to the Pretences of Lay
Patronages, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the like, and (4) for
Opposing the Tyranny and Injustice, of the
Proceedings of those in Power, who Condemn'd
Men unheard, Sentenc'd Men at Pleasure,
without Examining into the Facts, or hearing
Legal Witnesses; and punish'd Men to Death,
for such Crimes as were not punishable with
Death, by the Laws of the Land.</P>
<P>These and such as these, were the Points upon
which the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> suffer'd the most
Bloody Persecution, that has been heard of in
this Age, or for the last 100 Years pass'd in
the World. The Persecution of the <HI>Protestants</HI>
in <HI>France,</HI> being in proportion to this Country,
and the Number of People, and the Blood spilt,
no way to compare to it.</P>
<P>But to come now to the Suffering Party: The
Government having thus by their Unrighteous
Laws, made way for all the Oppressions which they
design'd, having Establish'd Prelacy, and
Dispossess'd the Presbyterian Ministers of their
Kirks, filling their Places with a Race of Men,
who for Ignorance and Wickedness, were scarse
to be equall'd in the World; I mean as Mini∣sters.
<PB N="148" REF="247"/>
The poor People were immediately scat∣ter'd
and disperss'd in a Dreadful manner: The
new Set of Men, were so weak in Capacity, and
so abominable in their known Practice and Con∣versation,
(speaking without the least prejudice
of the most of them), that the People abhorr'd
to hear them, or to come into the Churches
where they were.</P>
<P>This occasion'd them to follow their own Mi∣nisters,
tho' Dispossest, into private Places and
Corners, and to hear the Word Preached, and
have their Ordinances Administred in private
Houses and Meetings, as was soon after the
practise in <HI>England,</HI> by the Dissenters here.</P>
<P>The Ministers on the other Hand, thinking it
their Duty not to forsake their People, kept
themselves Concealed and Retired, and went
from House to House, Preaching and Praying,
Visiting, Baptizing, and in a Word performing
all the Duties of their Office, as opportunity
would allow.</P>
<P>This the Episcopal Party could not bear; and
therefore in the first place, fell to their former
custom of making Laws against it in Parlia∣ment,
and Enforcing those Laws by Proclama∣tions,
and Acts of Council, which they soon
brought to be of equal Force with Acts of Par∣liament,
tho' by Law it was quite otherwise,
<HI>Vid. 3d. Act 1. Sess. 1. Par. Car.</HI> 11. Entituled
ACT <HI>Asserting his Majesty's Royal Prerogative in
making Laws.</HI></P>
<P>These Laws against Non-Conformity, are so
Extraordinary, and Savour'd so much of a true
Spirit of Persecution, were in themselves so
Unjust, and in some things so Unnatural, that
none can wonder if the Execution of them
sometimes drove the poor People to Desperation,
<PB N="149" REF="248"/>
and made, as in far less moving Cases has been
said, <HI>Nature Rebel against Principle,</HI> and drove
the People, made thus Distracted by their op∣pressions
to Tumult and Rebellion.</P>
<P>And because they have in these Things, also
been rashly censur'd by some among us, as a
People suffering as Evil doers. It must be use∣ful
in their Vindication, to expose a little the
Inhumanity and Barbarity of their Persecutors;
and this can be done in nothing better than in
giving a Brief Account of the Laws now made;
which they expected, and rigorously exacted
Obedience to; and which it was impossible for
that Poor People to obey, without <HI>making Shipwreck
of Faith and a good Conscience,</HI> abandoning their
Profession, Inverting the Rule of the Apostle,
and obeying Man rather than God.</P>
<Q>These Acts are as follow.</Q>
<P>1. ACT discharging, <HI>i. e. forbidding</HI> all
“Writing, Remonstrating, Printing, Praying or
Preaching in such manner as should shew any
dislike, (1) Of the King's Supremacy in cau∣ses
Eccles<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>astick, (2) Of the Kings absolute
Prerogative, in appointing such Government
of the Church as he thought fit, and (3) Of
the Government of the Church by Bishops:
<HI>Act.” 2. Sess. 2. Parl.</HI> I. <HI>Carol.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>“2. ACT Prohibiting any Ministers to
Preach in Churches Publickly; or Privately in
Families, without Licence first had from the
Episcopal Ministers call'd Curates, and forbid∣ing
all House Meetings for Religious Exer∣cise.
<HI>Act. 4. Sess. 2. Parl. 1. Car.</HI> 2.”</P>
<P>Both these Acts were so directly contrary to
the Principles of the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> and it was so
<PB N="150" REF="249"/>
well known, that they could not in Conscience
comply with them, that they were very justly
call'd the persecuting Laws, together with the
following Act, which gave the Finishing Stroke
to the rest, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“3. ACT Declaring, that all Non Confor∣ming
Ministers that shall presume to Exercise
their Ministry in any manner whatsoever,
shall be Punished as Seditious Persons; requi∣ring

<P>“Every <HI>Burgess</HI> the loss of his Freedom, or
Burg-Ship, and a fourth part of his Moveable
Goods.”</P>
<P>Leaving it also to the Council, to Inflict far∣ther
Punishment, and to provide for the most
effectual Execution, which they did by Procla∣mations,
of the most Arbitrary, Illegal, and
Tyrannical Nature imaginable, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“<HI>Proclamation</HI> requiring all to keep to their
Parish Churches, under Penalty of 20 <HI>s.</HI> every
Omission; they knowing at the same time,
the poor People could not in Conscience
spend the Lords Day in such a manner.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Proclamation</HI> Prohibiting all Preaching,
Praying, or hearing in Families, if above
Three, more then the Domesticks of the Fa∣mily
were present; punishing those who had
more,” as Unlawful Conventicles.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="250"/>
“<HI>Proclamation</HI> appointing all such Meetings
not Authorised, as aforesaid, to be punished
either by Pecuniary or Corporal Punishments,
at the pleasure of the Council.”</P>
<P>“<HI>Proclamation</HI> Commanding Landlords, Ma∣sters
of Families and Magistrates, to cause
their Tenants, Children, Servants, Depen∣dents,
Taxmen, or Farmers of Duties and
Revenue, and all under their Charge, to Sub∣mit
and Conform to the Episcopal Government
and Worship, and making the said Landlords,
&amp;c. answerable for the Default of their Ser∣vants,
&amp;c. the Punishment here also being left
to the pleasure of the Council.”</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> They reserv'd here the Cruelty of Pu∣nishment
to themselves; to be inflicted, not as the
Laws or the Nature of the Offence should Direct,
but as the Person who they should have before
them, stood more or less in or out of their Fa∣vour.</P>
<P>Now to finish all, and Enforce these Laws and
Proclamations, the King Erected a High Com∣mission
Court, consisting of a Medley of Clergy,
Nobility, Magistrates and Soldiers. This Body
were Empower'd to hear and determine Causes,
without Appeal, to Execute Civil and Ecclesia∣stick
Authority; they could Suspend and Deprive
Clergy Men; Excommunicate like Bishops; Com∣mit
to Prison like Justices of the Peace; Sentence
like Judges; and put to Torture and Death like
<HI>Hangmen:</HI> In a Word, as a known <HI>Scots</HI> Author
calls them, <HI>they were a Hotch-potch-Mongrel-Monster
of a judicatory, Authoriz'd by the Prerogative against
the Laws of GOD and MAN, Illegal in its Consti∣tution
and Arbitrary in its Procedure, whereby Per∣sons
brought before them, were made to Answer
SƲPER INQUIRENDIS, without either Accusa∣tion</HI>
<PB N="152" REF="251"/>
“or Accuser, contrary to an Express standing Law,
Act. 13. Parl. 10. Jac. vi.</P>
<P>It is scarce to be related, what Innumerable
Oppressions fell upon the People, but especialiy
upon the poor Ministers, in the Prosecution of
these Laws; for the Ministers finding themselves
bound in Conscience, not to abandon their
Flocks, for any Persecution or Bodily Sufferings
whatsoever, exposed themselves freely to the
worst that their Enemies could do, and failed
not at the greatest and utmost Hazard, to dis∣charge
their Duty; and the People Flocking
after them, they Preached to them with what
Privacy and Caution they were able, but at the
Extreamest Hazard. Nor was it possible, but
that many would be daily falling into the Hands
of their Persecutors; insomuch, that the Prisons
were every where full of Faithful Ministers;
whereof abundance dyed, thro' the length of
their Confinement, and severity of their Usage;
some thro' Cold and Evil Lodging, having Con-tracted Diseases and Infirmities, and others for
want of Conveniences, and even Necessaries;
who<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Blood is no doubt to be Esteem'd, as shed
in the Cause of Religion, as much as if they had
been brought out to Execution, as several of
their Brethren afterwards were.</P>
<P>By this Scandalous Judicatory, call'd the High
Commission Court, many Innocent Men, as well
Ministers as others, were prosecuted even after
a manner, near a Kin to the <HI>Spanish</HI> Inquisition;
and as an Author well observes, having no other
Precedent in the <HI>Christian</HI> World, but the said <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>
Inquisition, being neither suffred to know
their Crimes or their Accuser; never suffred to
come to a Hearing, or to make any Legal Defence.
But when they demanded their Accusation, or
<PB N="153" REF="252"/>
indictment, and leave to Answer to the same,
they were told they could not be admitted to any
Defence, unless they would first take the Oath
by which they were to acknowledge and submit to
the Jurisdiction of their Judges; and then with∣out
hearing their Offence, or having leave to
An∣swer, they were sentenc'd to Scourging, Stigmati∣zing,
Banishment, Transportation, to Slavery in
<HI>Barbadoes,</HI> perpetual Imprisonment and the like;
as the Commissioners thought fit, and this to such
a Degree, that the People fled before them, and
the whole Country-sides, <HI>as they are called there,</HI>
became depopulate, for Non-Conformity. As
this High Commission Court is justly represented
to be the most Arbitrary, Illegal, Cruel, and
Unjust Judicatory, that ever was set up in a
<HI>Protestant</HI> Nation, and imitated by none, but
the Bloody Inquisition aforesaid, so it cannot
be Unacceptable in our relating the Sufferings of
the Good People of <HI>Scotland;</HI> to give some few
Instances, <HI>Out of an Innumerable Crowd of oppres'd
suffering Christians,</HI> of the vexations, Barbarities,
Inhuman and Illegal Practises of this Court, inpursuance
of the Commission given them, to put
the aforesaid Acts in Execution.</P>
<P>The Author of a Book Entituled, <HI>The wrest∣ing
of the Church of</HI> Scotland, has toucht at the
Irregularities and Inhumanities of their Pro∣ceedings;
but Alas! What are they to the In∣numerable
Examples, which living Testimony
are yet able to give, and which the Collector of
these particulars, has receiv'd from the Mouths,
ofmany of the Sufferers themselves.</P>
<P>I have already mentioned, how Persons were
brought before these new Judges without any No∣tice,
without Information, Accusation, Witness, or
Accuser: But being fetch'd in, were instantly
<PB N="154" REF="253"/>
<HI>Charg'd by way of Inquiry,</HI> and therefore was it
that this Court was not improperly call'd a Court
of Inquisition. The Arch-Prelate, or Bishop
of St. Andrews the same who was afterwards
kill'd, presiding therein.</P>
<P>Upon the bringing any Person before them,
he was requir'd immediately to Answer such
Questions as were propounded to him, being
allow'd neither Council to advise with, or time
to consider; if he answer'd Satisfactorily to one
Question, they would still find others to Ensnare
him; if he refused to Answer, and pleaded the
Great Law of Nature, <HI>Nemo tenetur Seipsum
accusare;</HI> they set him by Instantly as Convict,
and proceeded to Sentence; if he answer'd boldly
and perhaps smartly, they immediately Sen∣tence
him for Contumacy and Disrespect: A
Minister was Sentenc'd to Banishment for cal∣ling
the Archbishop, Sir, And not my Lord.
One Mr. <HI>Porterfield,</HI> a Gentleman of a Loyal
Family, was brought before them, and ask'd
why he did not' come to his Parish Church, to
hear the Curate; to which he gave them a very
pertinent Answer, <HI>viz.</HI> Because the Curate had
abused him, and slandreds him, in such a manner,
as was both Scandalous to him as a Minister,
and just Ground of Resentment to any thing of
a Gentleman. The Court upon his exposing
and proving the Fact, were asham'd of the
Curate, but being resolv'd to Revenge it on the
Gentleman, they put several other Questions to
him, all which he answer'd, so as no Advantage
could be gain'd of him, at which the Archbi∣shop
being Enrag'd, ask'd him if he would take
the Oath of Supremacy, which when he mo∣destly
declined, they immediately Sentenc'd
him to Banishment and Confinement, to the
<PB N="155" REF="254"/>
Town of <HI>Elgin</HI> far North, and Fin'd him almost
to the full value of his whole Estate; and this
was the constant Method when any Person
Conven'd before them, Could no other way be
laid hold of; nor in their Sentence did they
confine themselves to suit the Punishment to
the Offence, or consult the Power of their
Commission, but frequently Sentenced People to
the severest Punishment, for the smallest Offen∣ces,
and frequently pass'd such Sentences, as
they had no Power by their Commission to pass:
one Famous Example, among a great Multi∣tude
is left upon Record, as follows.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>John Levingston,</HI> a most Eminent and
Reverend Minister, particularly famous in the
Church of Scotland, had been Banish'd the King∣dom
for no other Reason, but his refusing the
Oath of Supremacy; there was Collated to that
Benefice, a Curate or Episcopal Minister, one
Mr. <HI>Scot,</HI> who it seems stood Excommunicated
before, and continued under that Sentence;
besides that, the People had other Objections
against his Morals and Good Name, insomuch,
that they publickly opposed him, at his coming
to Preach; and it seems, there were some warm
Expressions used by some of the People against
him, which he complain'd of to the High
Commission Court. Four poor Men of the
Parish, where hereupon Conven'd before them,
and being not charg'd with any thing by the said
<HI>Scot,</HI> but being Interrogated, they acknowledg'd
they were present, when the Parishioners did
declare their Dissatisfaction at Mr. <HI>Scots</HI> coming
to their Kirk, but said, that they did not speak
what was said.</P>
<P>This the Commissioners, contrary indeed to
several of their own Body, Vote to be a Confes∣sion
<PB N="156" REF="255"/>
of Guilt, and immediately gave this Barba∣rous
Sentence.</P>
<P>That the Four Men should be Scourged thro'
the Town, Stigmatiz'd on the Forehead with
the Letter <HI>T.</HI> at the Cross of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and be
Transported to the Island of <HI>Barbadoes;</HI> all
which was rigorously Executed: Nor was this
enough to satisfy the Rage of the <HI>Persecutors,</HI>
even in so trifling an Offence. But a few Days
after, two Brothers, and a young Maiden their
Sister, Inhabitants of the same Parish, were
sentenc'd on the same Account, the two Men
to be Banish'd to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and the young
Woman to be whipp'd thro' the Town of <HI>Jad∣burgh;</HI>
all which Sentences were Executed ac∣cordingly.</P>
<P>Two more Examples we have of their Justice,
which are very eminent; the One, of Mr. <HI>Smith,</HI>
a Learned <HI>Nonconforming</HI> Minister, who was
brought before them for Praying and Preaching
to a few of his Friends, met privately in a
Friend's House; they had, it seems, no Evi∣dence
of the Fact, much less any Thing to
object against what he had spoken.</P>
<P>When he came before the Commissioners, he
did not speak disrespectfully at all, but he de∣clin'd
giving the Arch-Bishop the Title of <HI>Lord:</HI>
At which, one of the Bench ask'd him very
scornfully, if he knew who it was he was
speaking to, and what Character he bore; to
which he answer'd, he did know him to
be Mr. <HI>James Sharps,</HI> once a Minister, as he him∣self
then was, and that he knew no higher Cha∣racter
any Christian Man could bear, than to
be a Minister, and Ambassador of <HI>Jesus Christ:</HI>
This he spoke, directing his Words to that
Commissioner who had reprov'd him, and gave
him the Titles he was known by.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="256"/>
This so enrag'd the Arch-Bishop, that he
knew not how with Violence enough to wreak
his Malice on the poor Man. But to shew his
Willingness to destroy him, he sentenc'd him,
besides his Sentence for <HI>Conventicli<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g,</HI> as they
call'd it, to be led by the Hangman to the Place
in the <HI>Tol-Booth</HI> call'd the <HI>Thieves Hole,</HI> and there
laid in heavy Irons, there being a raving Crea∣ture
who was an Idiot, and furious, confin'd in
the same Place, and left loose with him. Here
the godly Minister lay some Days in Danger of
being destroy'd by the poor demented Wretch,
who every Moment threaten'd to kill him. But
God, that stopped the Mouths of <HI>Daniel's</HI> Ly∣ons,
restrain'd him so that he hurt him not:
And these merciful Judges hearing, that by the
Grate of this Hole which look'd to the Street,
he was reliev'd and comforted by the Charity
and Compassion of many good People of the
City, many were threaten'd for relieving him;
and at length the poor Man was carry'd away
to a Place call'd the <HI>Iron House</HI> in the same
Prison; where none could come at him. Here
he continued cl∣ole Prisoner, and in Irons, for
many Days. Besides this, they sentenc'd him
for his private Preaching to <HI>perpetual Banishment</HI>
to the Island of <HI>Shetland,</HI> the coudest, and most
unhospitable of all the <HI>Caledonian</HI> Islands; where
his only Relief, as to this World, was the So∣ciety
of other blessed Sufferers banish'd thither
for the same <HI>Good Cause.</HI></P>
<P>The next Instance of their Cruelty was one
Mr. <HI>Black,</HI> a Lay-Man, charg'd by the Com∣missioners,
with having been at a Meeting
of a few Christians in a private Way, for Prayer;
whether any Minister was with them, or not,
was not alledg'd, neither had they any Thing
<PB N="158" REF="257"/>
else to charge upon him of any Kind what∣ever.
They could not prove his being at the
Meeting; but would have him confess, which
he declin'd: Then they demanded him to give
them an Account upon his Oath, who was at
the said Meeting. This he declare'd was against
his Conscience; and he would not be an Ac∣cuser
of <HI>Innocent Men:</HI> For denying this, they
sentenc'd him to <HI>be scourged thro' the Town;</HI>
which he very patiently submitted to, and
chearfully suffer'd.</P>
<P>It would be endless to enumerate the Names
of the Sufferers in this Case, and it has not
been possible for the Author of these Collec∣tions
to come at the certain Number of those
Ministers, or Others, who dy'd in Prisons and
Banishment, upon Account of these <HI>Persecuting
Laws,</HI> there being no Record preserv'd of their
Prosecution in any Court of Justice; nor could
any Roll of their Names be preserv'd in those
<HI>Times of Confusion</HI> any where, but under the <HI>Altar,</HI>
and about the <HI>Throne of the Lamb,</HI> where their
Heads are crown'd, and their <HI>White Robes</HI> seen,
where an exact Account of their Number
will at last be found.</P>
<P>But, according to the Reports of Creditable
and Impartial People, who, upon our earnest
Enquiry, have from their Memories, as well as
they could, recollected these Things, and putting
their several Relations together, comparing
them with what has been made publick. We
shall at the End of this Part give the Calculations
which such have made of the Numbers of those
suffering Christians, who falling into, or flying
from the Hands of their Cruel Persecutors, pe∣rished
in Prisons, and went into Banishment,
without any legal Process; most of whom pe∣rished
<PB N="159" REF="258"/>
by the Distresses and Extremities they
were reduc'd to by those Means. And a sur∣prizing
Number it will be to those who have
not enquir'd, into these Things, or discoursed
with the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> about them; and all
this before the Year 1666. A Time made re∣markable
upon the following Occasion, and to
which Occasion these Things have been the
unhappy Introduction.</P>
<P>If the poor People were by those insupportable
Violences made desperate, and driven to all the
Extremities of a wild Despair, who can justly
reflect upon them, when they read in the Word
of God, <HI>That Oppression makes a wise Man mad?</HI>
and therefore, were there no other Original of
the Insurrection, known by the Name of <HI>The
Rising of</HI> Pentland, it was nothing but what
the intolerable Oppressions of those Times might
have justify'd to all the World; Nature having
dictated to all People a Right of Self-Defence,
when illegally and arbitrarily attack'd in a man∣ner not justifiable either by the Laws of Nature,
the Laws of God, or the Laws of the Country.</P>
<P>But besides all this it is evident, that this Insur∣rection
was no premeditated Design, but began
in the Violence of Military Execution committed
by four Soldiers commanded by Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI>
who falling into some Houses in <HI>Galloway</HI> without
Commission, or without Order from their own
Officers, as Sir <HI>James</HI> afterwards alledged,
were opposed, and driven out of their Doors
by four or five honest Men of the Inhabitants,
in the just Defence of their Wives, Children
and Goods unjustly insulted and offer'd to be
plundred by the said Soldiers. The more parti∣cular
Relation of this Part is recorded as follows.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="259"/>
Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> was an Officer of Dragoons
who was sent with his Troops by Order of the
Council, to quarter <HI>at Discretion</HI> upon the poor
<HI>Western</HI> People of <HI>Scotland,</HI> because there they
found the chief Body of the constant Sufferers
for, and Adherers to the <HI>True Religion</HI> were to
be found.</P>
<P>This Sir <HI>James</HI> was a Tool to their Minds, a
Stranger in the Country, being an <HI>English</HI> Man,
bred to Plunder and Rapine in the Service of
of the <HI>French,</HI> perfectly void of the Fear of
God, or Man, and unacquainted either with
Religion, or Humanity. He had made three
Invasions into this Part of the Country, where
his Cruelty and Exactions had been such as had
almost stript the Country, not of its Substance
only, but even of its Inhabitants, who were o∣bliged
to quit their Habitations to avoid the
Fury and Brutality of the Soldiers.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give the Detail of the
Cruelties and inhuman Usage the poor People
suffered from this Butcher, for such he was ra∣ther
than a Soldier; neither is it the present
Purpose but to introduce what follow'd at this
Time.</P>
<P>The poor People had patiently suffered the
merciless Treatment this Man shew'd them a∣bove
seven Months, and thereby testify'd more
<HI>Passi've Submission,</HI> than most of those who have
since upbraided them with <HI>Resistance</HI> can pre∣tend
to; when Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> put an End to
their Patience by the following Occasion.</P>
<P>On the 13th Day of <HI>November,</HI> 1666, he sent
four Soldiers from <HI>Dumfries</HI> where he quarter'd,
to a Town call'd <HI>Damfries,</HI> in the Shire of <HI>Gallo∣way,</HI>
with Orders to seize upon a poor Man's
Goods, who, he pretended, to have <HI>broken the Laws</HI>
<PB N="161" REF="260"/>
by not coming to his Parish-Church; and if
he had no Goods, to take the Man, and bring
him Prisoner to <HI>Dumfries:</HI> The Soldiers, as
Sir <HI>James</HI> alledg'd after, beyond their Instruc∣tions,
not only seized his Goods, but his Person
too; and binding the poor Old Man Hand and
Foot, like a Beast, brought him out, and laid
him on the Ground 'till they rifled his House.</P>
<P>The Neighbours moved with Compassion at
the Indignity of the Usage, and at seeing a
poor Ancient Man lye on the Ground, bound
like a Beast, to be carry'd away to the Slaughter;
and with just Indignation at the Insolence of
the four Soldiers, came to the Soldiers, and
calmly entreated them to unbind him, and to
let him go with them like a Prisoner, and like
a Man, not like a Beast.</P>
<P>The insolent Soldiers pretend to be affronted
at this Motion, and fall immediately upon the
People with their Swords, wounding two or
three. This so enraged the rest, that they
attack'd the Soldiers immediately, wounded one,
and made the rest throw down their Arms, and
beg <HI>Quarter.</HI></P>
<P>This Breach, thus purely accidental, and by an
unforeseen Provocation being begun, the Sol∣diers
vowing Revenge, and preparing to fall up∣on
the whole neighbouring Part of the Coun∣try,
drove the innocent People to the Necessity
of gathering together, and standing upon their
own Defence: So that when Ten or Twelve
Soldiers return'd with their bloody Resolution
of Plunder, and Desolation, they were likewise
disarm'd, and made Prisoners, and when after
this Three Troops were sent, they found the
People too strong to be attack'd, upon which,
they cryed prefently, <HI>A REBBLLION;</HI> ds
<PB N="162" REF="261"/>
and sent for more Forces, which of course o∣bliged
Others to run in to the Aid of their Bre∣thren,
all which was purely casual, 'till finding
themselves reduc'd by this last gathering toge∣ther
to a Circumstance which <HI>stay</HI> or <HI>go,</HI> would be
fatal to them if they fell into the Hands of the Go∣vernment,
they law no Remedy but to stand to it,
and inviting all the Injur'd and Oppress'd People
to joyn with them, they declar'd <HI>for Liberty and
the Kirk of</HI> Scotland; upon this, marching to <HI>Dum∣fries,</HI>
they there seiz'd their great Persecutor
Sir <HI>James Turner</HI> in his Quarters: Afterwards
they march'd to <HI>Kirkubright,</HI> to <HI>Air,</HI> and from
thence to <HI>Lanerck,</HI> where they solemnly renew'd
the COVENANT, and resolv'd to seal it
with their Blood, as we shall immediately find
they were oblig'd to do.</P>
<P>The brief History of this Rebellion is such, as
it can be no considerable Interruption to our
Story, and is much to the Purpose, to relate
it. The Occasion being as above; the People
having by Necessity been driven to repel unjust
Violence by Force, and seeing no Room for
Mercy, but a certain Destruction at Hand from
the Troops which were drawing about them,
they resolv'd to stand to it; they were not en∣creased
to above Four Hundred Men, but those
very well arm'd when they marched to the Town
of <HI>Dumfries,</HI> where, as I have said, they seiz'd
upon Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> who was the Comman∣ding
Officer of the persecuting Troops which
had opprest them; him they carry'd away Pri∣soner,
tho' as he confest they used him very ci∣villy.
From thence gathering and encreasing in
Number, they march'd to <HI>Kirkubright</HI> and <HI>Air,</HI>
principal Towns and Sea-ports on that Side the
Country, where they seiz'd upon all the Arms
<PB N="163" REF="262"/>
and Ammunition they could find, but in no o∣ther
Thing offered any Injury to any Man. From
hence they advanc'd, being (as was reported)
encreased to the Number of above Two Thou∣sand,
tho' <HI>that</HI> was a great Mistake, to the Town
of <HI>Lancrck,</HI> where on the 26th Day of <HI>November,</HI>
they had a great Meeting, and in a solemn
Manner fasted and humbled themselves in Be∣half
of the Nation of <HI>Scotland</HI> for the great Sin
of National Perjury in making void the COVE∣NANT;
and there in the most solemn Manner
possible they renew'd the said COVENANT
with their Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven.
From hence they advanc'd still towards <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
where they arriv'd the 27th of <HI>November,</HI>
1666, but being not strong enough to attack the
City, they posted themselves at the Foot of
<HI>Pentland</HI> Hills on the <HI>South-West</HI> of the City,
waiting the Conjunction of other Friends who
they expected from the Border and from the
City of <HI>Edinburgh.</HI></P>
<P>Here they were attack'd and surpris'd the next
Day by General <HI>Dalziel,</HI> even during a proclai∣med
Cessation, with a Body of the King's Forces,
and after a very bold and resolute Defence, they
were at length overpower'd and broken: Many
efcaped, having disperst themselves the Two
Days immediately before the Fight, about Fifty
were kill'd upon the Place, Eighty were taken
Prisoners, and the rest sav'd themselves by Flight.</P>
<P>For this Action, besides those slain, Ten were
executed at <HI>Edinburgh, December</HI> the 7th, and
the 11th, <HI>Thomas Paterson</HI> by Name, who was
condemn'd with them dy'd in the <HI>Tolbooth</HI> before
Execution being grievously wounded. Five
more were likewise condemn'd the 10th, and
of four them executed the 14th. Four more
<PB N="164" REF="263"/>
were executed at <HI>Glasgow</HI> the 19th of <HI>December,</HI>
six more at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the 22th, eight more at
Air, two at <HI>Dumfries,</HI> and two at <HI>Irvine;</HI> Five
and Fifty who had made their Escape, were
<HI>Fore-Faulted,</HI> as they call it, or Outlawed, and
Proclamation with Reward made for apprehen∣ding
them, declaring it Treason to harbour,
relieve, receive, or so much as to see and speak
to them. Among these were several Ministers,
of whom more hereafter.</P>
<P>It will hardly be allow'd us in <HI>England</HI> to call
this <HI>Persecution,</HI> or, that the Sufferers here put
to Death should be reckoned among the Martyrs
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> because (say they) these were Men
taken in Arms against the King, and executed
as Traytors. But we leave all those who afterwards
thought it lawful to joyn in the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and
in taking up Arms against the Oppressions and
Arbitrary Government of King <HI>JAMES,</HI> to
judge, whether these good Men had not the
same individual Reasons and more for this <HI>Pent∣land</HI>
Expedition; and it is Answer enough to all
that shall read these Sheets, to say, that these
Men dyed for that lawful resisting of Arbitrary
Power, which has been justified as legal, and
acknowledg'd to be justifiable by the Practise
and Declaration of the respective Parliaments of
both Kingdoms: But we leave all those Dis∣putes
to the Readers to determine, as Truth
and Justice shall guide them, and return to the
History of Fact.</P>
<P>Besides the Death of these poor Men, we find
upon Record above Eight Hundred Men pro∣scrib'd,
and driven from their Families by the
Violence of the Proceedings of this <HI>High Com∣mission</HI>-Court,
who, besides those afterwards fal∣len
upon, of whom more remains to be said,
<PB N="165" REF="264"/>
these suffered in their Flight all the Miseries that
Tongue can express, even beyond what we read
of in the <HI>11th</HI> of the <HI>Hebrews. They wander'd about
in Sheeps Skins, and Goat Skins, in Dens, and
Caves of the Earth, being destitute, afflicted, tor∣mented.</HI>
They suffer'd Extremities that Tongue
cannot describe, and which Heart can hardly con∣ceive
of, from the dismal Circumstances of Hun∣ger,
Nakedness, and the Severity of the Cli∣mate;
where it is known how unsufferable the
Cold is; lying in damp Caves, and in hollow
Clefts of the naked Rocks, without Shelter,
Covering, Fire, or Food: None durst harbour,
entertain, relieve, or speak to them, upon Pain
of Death: Many, for venturing to receive
them, were forced to fly to them, and several
put to Death for no other Offence; Fathers
were persecuted for supplying their Children,
and Children, for nourishing their Parents; Hus∣bands,
for harbouring their Wives, and Wives,
for cherishing their own Husbands; the Tyes
and Obligations of the Laws of Nature were no
Defence, but it was made <HI>Death</HI> to perform na∣tural
Duties, and many suffer'd Death for Acts
of Piety and Charity, in Cases where humane
Nature could not bear the Thoughts of suffer∣ing
it. To such an Extreme was the Rage of
these Persecutors carried on.</P>
<P>Besides these Eight Hundred Families, who
I call <HI>proscrib'd,</HI> and were oblig'd to fly from
their Habitations to avoid the Cruelty and Rapine
of their <HI>Persecutors;</HI> there were Fifty five Eminent
Persons who were <HI>Pannell'd,</HI> or as we call it in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
Arraign'd, as being actually in Arms in the
<HI>Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>land</HI> Expedition; and being prosecuted by
the Advocate, were sentenc'd respectively to be
<HI>Executed to Death when Apprehended: And in the
<PB N="166" REF="265"/>
mean Time their Estates to be forfeited, and seiz'd
upon to the KING's Ʋse.</HI> Among these were
the following Miniters; of whom more is to
be said,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Mr. John Welch,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. James Smith,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. John Cunningham,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Gabriel Semple,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. John Guthrie,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Alexander Peddin,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. William Veach,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. John Crookshanks,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. Gabriel Maxwell,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Mr. John Cairstaires.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>But GOD, in his infinite Goodness, deli∣ver'd
<HI>these</HI> &amp; out of their Hands. Also it is
very observable, that some of the above-nam'd
Fifty two <HI>Out-law'd Persons</HI> being Gentlemen of
good Estates, their said Estates were seized on,
and given by the King to the most violent of
their <HI>Persecutors,</HI> as an Encouragement to O∣thers
to imitate the Inhumanity and Butchery
by which Things had been thus brought to
Extremity.</P>
<P>Nay, some of them thought, that the <HI>Council</HI>
had it in their real Design, to drive the poor
People to the <HI>Necessity of Talking Arms,</HI> in Hole
of getting their Blood and Estates more in their
Power.</P>
<P>Never more let us talk of Popish Cruelties, or
give the <HI>Romanists</HI> the Title of BLOODY; let
not the Rigour of the <HI>Inquisition</HI> any farther en∣gage
our Pens, 'till the Barbarities of this <HI>pro∣testant
Inquisition,</HI> the merciless, unrelenting Fury
of these <HI>Protestant</HI> Persecutors has been expiated,
by their being abhorr'd by all Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="266"/>
But to leave the Generals, and descend a little
to Particulars as they occur historically to our
View.</P>
<P>It is proper to mention here, because we shall
have Occasion to speak of their Names again,
that, amongst the rest of the Ministers who fled
on this unhappy Affair, Mr. <HI>John Welch,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>Gabriel Sample</HI> were two, whose Zeal and
Sincerity in the Cause of Religion occasion'd
their being more eminent than their Brethren.
These fled to the Borders, where they found
Shelter, and Friends to harbour them in an un∣expected
Manner; and where they were made
wonderful Instruments in God's Hand, to plant
the Gospel and the Fear of God in the Hearts
of the most bloody and barbarous of Men, who
were before Robbers, and Murtherers, who, by
the Preaching of these banished Ministers be∣came
Eminent Converts, and both them, and
their Posterity were made Emineut in the
Knowledge of God, and in their Love to his
Ways, in so much, that to the Praise of so∣veraign
Grace, those rude and unguided Bor∣derers
are now the most zealous Professors of
the True Religion in <HI>Britain;</HI> and those Places
which were Dens of Robbers and Receptacles
of Thieves and Murtherers, are now become
some of the best planted, and most flourishing
Congregations of serious Christians, perhaps,
in the World.</P>
<P>It must not be forgotten here to mention the
Methods taken after this to prosecute, and fol∣low
those that fled; <HI>which</HI> (it was said) <HI>was ow∣ing
to the merciless Disposition of the Arch-Bishop
of St. Andrew's (viz.</HI>) publishing a Proclama∣tion,
prohibiting the concealing, or correspon∣ding
with any of those who had escaped; and
<PB N="168" REF="267"/>
this on <HI>Pain of High-Treason.</HI> In this <HI>Proclamation</HI>
the Fifty seven <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>Ministers</HI> mention'd
before were particularly nam'd.</P>
<P>Thus the Persecution of God's Servants in one
Country has often been the Means of calling
of Others; and perhaps is yet to be the Means
of spreading and planting the EVERLASTING
GOSPEL in all Corners of the World, of which
this Border of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the Colony of <HI>New-England</HI>
has been such Noble Examples, as we
need look no farther into History to multiply
Particulars.</P>
<P>But before I quit this Part, one Thing can∣not
be omitted, with Relation to the good
Men who dyed thus on Account of this Re∣bellion.
The <HI>Persecutors,</HI> for such this very
Thing will prove them to be: As if they
were fond of having it said, That these Men
dyed for Religion, and not for being in Arms;
and as if they scorn'd the Excuse which the
Affair of <HI>Pentland</HI> put into their Mouths for
putting them to Death, causes several of them
to be offer'd their Lives, if they would take,
and subscribe the <HI>DECLARATION to re∣nounce
the</HI> COVENANT. Whether they did
this fraudulently or sincerely, Providence never
gave them an Opportunity to discover. Nor,
whether if the Weakness of any had brought them
to yield, they would have perform'd their
Promise to them, or no. For, not a Man they
ever offer'd it to (I mean of those condemn'd
to dye for the Rebellion of <HI>Pentland</HI>) but re∣ceiv'd
it with Indignation, and chose to dye,
rather than to yield to that <HI>Ʋnconscionable Pro∣posal.</HI>
So that in that Point they gain'd an
<HI>Ʋndeniable Testimony</HI> that they <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uffer'd for Re∣ligion,
<HI>Not accepting Deliverance:</HI> For none or
<PB N="169" REF="268"/>
them esteem'd <HI>Renouncing the COVENANT</HI>
to be any Thing more, or less, than <HI>Renouncing</HI>
GOD <HI>and his CHƲRCH,</HI> to whom, and
for which, that <HI>CONVENANT</HI> was first en∣ter'd,
and engaged in.</P>
<P>The Cruelty of these Executions was
attended with one Piece of Inhumanity, which
we believe no <HI>PROTESTANTS</HI> ever practised
before; nor was it practised in all the <HI>Popish Per∣secutious</HI>
in <HI>England</HI> in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> Days:
A Barbarity beyond the Cruelty of Death (viz.)
causing the Drums to beat round the Scaffold
all the while the Executions lasted, that the
People might not hear what the Sufferers had
to lay to them, and to discompose and dis∣order
them as much as possible in their last
Moments.</P>
<P>It is very remarkable, that the like of this
was never read of in any modern History, ex∣cept
in the History of that <HI>Bloody Tyrant</HI> and
<HI>Persecutor</HI> the Duke <HI>d' Alva,</HI> Governour of the
<HI>Netherlands</HI> for the King of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>From this Time we may date the <HI>Perse∣cution</HI>
to be in its <HI>Heighth of Fury:</HI> For the
Rage of the <HI>Persecutors</HI> extended every Way,
Provok'd by the Constancy of the Sufferers;
till it came to such a Heighth, as was never
yet heard of in any <HI>Protestant</HI> Country in the
World.</P>
<P>The <HI>Poor People</HI> were driven from their Ha∣bitations
and from their Families: This was
indeed in their Power, and they did it with
the utmost Cruelty; but they could never drive
them from their <HI>Principles.</HI> Nor while <HI>Mini∣sters</HI>
were to be found, who durst preach to
them, was it ever possible to prevent the
<HI>People</HI> assembling to hear them, were the <HI>Pe∣nalty</HI>
<PB N="170" REF="269"/>
Loss of Goods, Liberty, Imprisonment;
nay, even Death itself. And which was still
wonderful; the more their <HI>Persecutors</HI> multi∣plyed
Laws and <HI>Penalties</HI> against them, and the
more they were punished by those Laws for
those Assemblies, the more numerous they grew,
and Multitudes were added to the Church
every Day by the Sufferings which they met
with.</P>
<P>But the subtil Enemy finding this, fell upon
a Stratagem which did more Harm to <HI>RE∣LIGION</HI>
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> as it made a Breach
and Division among the Sufferers, than all the
<HI>Cruelty</HI> of the <HI>Persecutors</HI> could ever do; and
this was what they called <HI>The INDƲLGENCE.</HI>
The History whereof is necessary to the Ju∣stification
of the suffering People, as well a∣gainst
the Reproaches of their Friends, who
were not rightly informed of their Circum∣stances,
as against the Slanders of their E∣nemies.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The short Account of the Affair is thus.</HEAD>
<P>“KING <HI>CHARLES</HI> IId. was a Prince,
not naturally enclin'd to <HI>Cruelty,</HI> not
a <HI>Man of Blood</HI> by his Disposition; and had, it
seems, some about him, who had taken the
Freedom to let him know more of the In∣humanity
and Barbarity of the <HI>Arch-Bisop</HI>
and his Accomplices, than these were desirous
he should have heard of: And particularly,
what was alledg'd by the Friends of the
Kirk against that <HI>Prelate's Conduct,</HI> when
the King had once before, upon the like
Representation, sent an <HI>Express Order</HI> to the
<HI>Councils, That no more should be∣out to Death</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="270"/>
(viz.) <HI>That the Arch-Bishop kept that ORDER
in his Pocket, 'till he had seen the Execution
of the last Nine or Eleven of the</HI> Pentland
<HI>Men who were Condemn'd.”</HI></P>
<P>This being represented to the King, his Majesty
began to resnt it; and spoke some Things,
which gave them Reason to think that he
would some Way or other put a Stop to their
Proceeding, if they did not find out some new
Method to impose upon him: This they
wickedly, but effectually did, at the same
Time, and in the same Act, and Deed, by
which they very fatally divided the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> against it self in the manner following.</P>
<P>First, They told the King, That they (the
Council) were not at all prosecuting the Whole Kirk;
but only some few Men that were Enemies to humane So∣ciety,
and not safe to be suffer'd in a Civil Go∣vernment,
who denyed even the Ordinance of Ma∣gistracy
it self; and would neither acknowledge,
to submit to His Majesty's Authority or the Laws
of the Kingdom; a few Obstinate Rebels, who
would neither Obey the Laws of GOD, or submit
to the Government of Man. That to convince
His Majesty of the Truth of this, they had resolv'd
to publish, an ACT OF INDULGENCE to all
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who would submit to the Civil Magistrate, and
give Assarances of their Fidelity to His Majesty's
Person and Government, allowing them the Exercise
of Relig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, according to their Consciences; and them
His Majesty, would see, that those People who would
stand out, were not fit to be suffer'd in a human
Society, were Irreconcilcable Enemies to His Ma∣jesty
and such, as no Government could be safe,
till they were rooted out and destroy'd. With
<HI>this Hypocritical Shew of</HI> CLEMENCY <HI>they</HI>
satisfy'd that Easie Prince, a Man given up to
<PB N="172" REF="271"/>
his Luxury and the Effeminacy of his Vices, and
who suffer'd the Mildness of his Disposition to be
deluded with false Pretences under the shadow of
Lenity, to all that were proper Objects of Com∣passion;
and leaving those who were misrepre∣sented
by his Flatterers, to the matchless Rage of
their irreconcileable Enemies.</P>
<P>To carry on this Farce, they pass'd an
Act of <HI>Indulgence,</HI> as they call'd it, <HI>Anno</HI> 1669,
after they had wasted the <HI>West</HI> of <HI>Scotland</HI> by their
Soldiers, even worse than an Enemies Army
would have done in Time of War; and after the
Sufferers were so entirely scatter'd, that few were
to be found, and very little Plunder lest to satisfy
the Rapine of their Dragoons: By their Act of
Council, <HI>for they caused their Acts of Council to bear
the Authority of Laws,</HI> they proclaimed, “That
all such Outed Ministers as should take License
from the Council,” or the Bishop of the Diocess,
<HI>which Licenses also had several Limitations annex'd,
all of them directly contrary to the Presbyterian Prin∣ciple,</HI>
and Homologating, <HI>as they term it, the Au∣thority
of the Civil Magistrate in Ecclesiastick Affairs,
even to the Height of</HI> Erastianism: “All such
Ministers were allowed to preach, and exercise
the Ministerial Functions in private Houses or
Meetings, and their People allowed to attend
them with a <HI>Non obstante,</HI> to all Acts of Parlia∣ment
then in Force to the contrary.” So that here
was not only an Invasion of the Church, but the
Exercise of the Dispensing Power in the Extre∣mity,
setting aside the establish 'd Laws made in
Parliament, by the Authority of the Council.</P>
<P>This <HI>Indulgence</HI> kindled a terrible Flame of
Division and Breach of Charity among the suffer∣ing
good People, a <HI>Schism</HI> that is really such,
carried on even to Excommunicating one another,
<PB N="173" REF="272"/>
and the Effects of which is felt even to this Day.</P>
<P>Many Ministers upon Principles to themselves,
perhaps satisfactory, came in, and accepted this
<HI>Indulgence;</HI> being willing to go any Length that
their Consciences could be satisfy'd with, in Or∣der
to preserve the Priviledge of exercising their
Ministry, and preaching the Gospel to their
People.</P>
<P>But the persecuted People, whose Zeal com∣manded
them not to do the least Evil to reap
the greatest Good, began to protest against this
Compliance of their Brethren, as wicked and de∣testable;
declaring not only against the <HI>Indulgence</HI>
itself, but against all those who submitted to it,
as guilty of yielding to the Power of the Prelate's
<HI>Homologating</HI> the Supremacy, forsaking their Prin∣ciples,
and breaking the <HI>Covenant.</HI> In a Word,
they not only refused to accept such a <HI>sinful Tolera∣tion,</HI>
but protested against the making it, as void in
its own Nature, and this in the warmst Manner;
and being thus effectually secluded from the Ad∣vantage
of worshipping GOD in their Houses,
even in the most secret Manner possible, they
<HI>took to the Fields.</HI></P>
<P>Now their Persecutors obtain'd what they de∣sired:
For, now they thought they might with
Assurance boast to the King, of having made a
right Judgment in these Affairs; and having said
many favourable Things of those they call'd the
<HI>Sober Presbyterians,</HI> whom now they cajol'd, in
Order to bring them to accept of the <HI>Indulgence,</HI>
and to take <HI>Licenses;</HI> they represented those
who remain'd, who were now call'd WHIGGS,
as a Party, who were not to be suffer'd in any
Government, but that ought to be rooted off
from the Face of the Earth; and this is the first
Time that the Name of a WHIGG was used in
<PB N="174" REF="273"/>
the World I mean, as applied to a Man, or to
a Party of Men; and these were the original pri∣mitive
WHIGGS, the Name for many Years
being given to no other People. The Word is said
to be taken from a mixt Drink the poor Men
drank in their Wanderings compos'd of Water
and sour Milk; <HI>but that by the Way.</HI></P>
<P>At the same Period began the <HI>Field-Preachings,</HI>
or <HI>Field-Conventicles,</HI> of which I shall have fre∣quent
Occasion to speak more largely.</P>
<P>And at the same Period also, the People fre∣quenting
these Meetings, or Field-Preachings,
were first call'd <HI>Cemeronians,</HI> from one Mr. <HI>Ca∣meron,</HI>
a zealous Assertor of the <HI>Sovereignty of Con∣science
over the Laws of Men,</HI> of whom also we
shall have Occasion to speak hereafter.</P>
<P>If the Persecution was cruel and furious before,
it was now raging and unsufferable, carry'd on
with such Madness, and with such ail unsatisfy'd
Thirst of Blood, that I believe, none of the <HI>Hea∣then
Persecutions</HI> in the primitive Times could go
beyond it in all its Parts. It is true, they did
not immediately torment the Body by Fire, by
Racks, and a vast Variety of instrumental Tor∣tures;
tho' they had Cruelty enough that Way
too, as in those barbarous Engines of Cruelty
call'd the <HI>Boot</HI> and the <HI>Thumbkins,</HI> than which
a more exquisite Torture could hot easily be de∣vised.</P>
<P>But they had Torments beyond the Cruelty of
Death, which they drove the poor persecuted
People to suffer (<HI>viz.</HI>) the driving them from
their Habitations into Mountains and Hills, into
Dens, and Holes, and Caves of the Earth, at∣tended
with unsufferable, unsupportable Hunger
and Cold, in a Climate the most unhospitable,
and Places most barren, and empty of Suste∣nance
<PB N="175" REF="274"/>
or Relief of any in these Parts of the
World.</P>
<P>It is not to be calculated how many were starv'd
in this Manner, and whose Bones, <HI>many of them,</HI>
were found afterwards, who had perished in the
most deplorable Circumstances, and were not
discover'd by any other Remains; it would make
the Heart of any considering Christian an bleed, to
contemplate the Miseries of those People who pe∣rished
in this deplorable Manner, when such was
the Cruelty of their Persecutors, that even the
Parents durst not relieve, or entertain their
Children, or Children harbour, or nourish their
Parents: But, if the Person was accused of hav∣ing
been at one of these <HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> they
were immediately <HI>proscrib'd,</HI> and <HI>intercommuned,</HI>
by which it was made Death for any one so much
as to speak with them, much more to harbour,
or relieve them.</P>
<P>It has been enquir'd, why these People would
ib obstinateiy continue to assemble in these <HI>Field-Meetings;</HI>
and I have heard them censur'd by
many, who did not uriderstand the Circum∣stances
which they were reduced to which,
therefore, it is necessary a little to describe.</P>
<P>It is mentioned before, how severe the Laws
they had already made, were against those who
<HI>did not come to Church:</HI> And how none were per∣mitted
to exercise the <HI>Ministerial Office,</HI> but upon
such and such Limitations. This they found
embarrass'd them, with the whole Body of the
Kirk, and begun to appear too rigid and se∣vere:
And for this Reason, as before, the <HI>In∣dulgence</HI>
was set on Foot. After which <HI>Lenity,</HI>
as it was call'd; they suppos'd nothing would
be call'd <HI>Cruelty</HI> upon those, whowould not ac∣cept
of <HI>Liberty</HI> upon their Terms; and therefore,
<PB N="176" REF="275"/>
no sooner was the <HI>Indulgence</HI> granted, but they
began to persecute with the utmost Fury all
those, who either would not, or did not accept
of their <HI>Benevolent Indulgence.</HI></P>
<P>Immediately Sanguinary Laws were made to
fall upon those they had now doom'd to Destruc∣tion,
for <HI>not complying with</HI> their <HI>most merciful
TOLERATION;</HI> and <HI>First</HI> as such, who thought
fit <HI>to take Licenses from the Bishops,</HI> were admit∣ted,
or indulged to Meet, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in such and
such Places. So all other were immediately
sentenc'd, by a Law to <HI>suppress Conventicles;</HI>
whereby all those <HI>Ministers,</HI> who presum'd to
<HI>Preach, Expound,</HI> or <HI>Pray</HI> in any House where
were more than the Family, were to be impri∣son'd
'till they gave Security never to offend
again, or to depart the Kingdom; and every
Person <HI>presented</HI> in such House to be fin'd a fourth
Part of their Annual Rent, if Gentlemen, and
in Proportion for others: But for <HI>Field-Conven∣ticles,</HI>
the Preacher was to be put to Death, and
his Goods Confiscated, and 500 Marks Reward was
given to the Person that should apprehend them;
the Hearers also to be fin'd double to what the
Hearers in House-Conventicles were fin'd.
This is that Famous Persecuting Law, enticuled,
<HI>Act against Conventicles,</HI> 6. Act. 2d. Sess. 2d. Parl.
Cha. II. Anno 1670. and was continued afterwards
for Three Years more, and after that continued
again, and the Fines doubled.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ministers</HI> who could not accept of this
<HI>Indulgence,</HI> had now their Sentence; if they
thought fit to lay aside their Office, and neither
be <HI>Minister,</HI> or <HI>Hearer,</HI> they were indeed to∣lerably
safe; but this they could not yield to.
What was then before them, as <HI>Ministers,</HI> was
clear; for <HI>House-Meetings,</HI> Imprisonment and
<PB N="177" REF="276"/>
Banishment; for <HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> immediate
Death. This however did not deterr the poor
People to assemble themselves together, or the
Ministers to attend and perform the Duty of
their Office, at first, in Houses, but afterwards,
their Numbers encreasing, they assembled in the
Fields, or Mountains rather; and that in such
Numbers, and so well prepar'd, as that their
Persecutors often paid dear for foalling upon them.</P>
<P>But this enrag'd them the more, and oc∣casion'd
the Persecution to rise to such a Height,
as can scarce be equall'd for its Cruelty and Va∣riety
in any History.</P>
<P>As I have said, the Numbers of the People
flocking to the Ministers were not to be con∣cealed,
indeed not to be contained in Houses;
so that it presently become so dangerous to meet
in that Manner, that few, if any such Meetings
could be held, without being discover'd, in
which Case the Minister was sure to suffer Im∣prisonment
and Banishment, and the poor People
were as sure to be ruin'd by Fines.</P>
<P>This caused them to quit their Houses, and go
co the Hills, the Beginning of <HI>Field-Conventicles,</HI>
as I said before, where they had both Conveni∣ance
of Meeting, were much easier conceal'd,
and had more Opportunity to make their E∣scapes,
if discover'd: Before this had been long
practised, the Council took the Alarm; It is
true, as soon as ever the poor People took to
this Method, their Numbers encreased to a pro∣digious
Degree; for Thousands of People, who
durst not distinguish themselves in appearing at
House-Meetings, finding more Safety, and al∣most
an Impossibility of being discover'd in these
<HI>Field-Meetings,</HI> crowded thither; so that it was
very frequent to have 7, 8 to 10000 People at
a Time at those Meetings.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="277"/>
Upon this Method, the Council being, as I
said, alarm'd, resolv'd to raise Forces, and to
put the Kingdom to the Expence of keeping,
and supporting a <HI>Standing Army,</HI> on Pretence of
suppressing the <HI>Cameronians;</HI> a People, who all
that while desir'd no more than a quiet, peace∣able
enjoying the <HI>Liberty of serving GOD, free
from the Impositions of Men; and who, altho' they
had already suffered all kinds of Oppressions and In∣justice,
yet offered Violence to none;</HI> what provok'd
their Enemies on this Occasion was, that they
could not fall upon them now in the usual Man∣ner
by their Civil Officers and Persecutors; for
the People having been before disperst from
their Habitations, and not daring to appear
where they were known; yet now gather'd to∣gether
from all Parts to the <HI>Solemn Occasions</HI> of
worshipping GOD without any Fear, and in a
Posture not to be easily disturbed. This their
Persecutors presently called <HI>REBELLION,</HI> and
represented it as well to the <HI>Parliament</HI> there,
as to the <HI>King</HI> Himself, in the most formidable
Appearances, as a Thing threatening a <HI>Civil War;</HI>
and which, if not timely supprest, would em∣broil
the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>As it was easy for them to impose by these
Things on the most credulous Prince in the
World; so they had their Agents ready at Court
to aggravate, and expatiate upon every Article:
And by this Means they brought the Court into
all their most Sanguinary Resolutions, and hav∣ing,
<HI>as is said,</HI> obtained an Act of Parliament,
whereby they made it Death, and Confiscation
of Goods, for any Minister to Preach, or Pray
at these <HI>Field-Meetings.</HI> They had this specious
Pretence to raise Forces to put that Law in Exe∣cution.
The Number of Soldiers they raised was not
<PB N="179" REF="278"/>
great, at first, amounting in the whole, not to
above 2500 Men, most Dragoons; but they
afterwards thought fit to joyn 3000 <HI>Highland</HI>
Thieves to them, by which they compleated
the Ruin of the Country. With these Forces
they pursued these poor People thro' the Hills
and Mountains, to disturb and separate their As∣semblies;
to which Purpose, they were order'd
to seize, secure, and apprehend all they could
lay Hold on, to murther, and destroy all that
made Resistance; and to plunder, and waste
the Goods of those, who they could not appre∣hend:
Nor was any Cruelty omitted by these
Dragoons, which it was in their Power to inflict,
'till their Mas;ters obtain'd by them the great
End, which they always aim'd at, (<HI>viz.</HI>) to
make the poor People desperate, and drive them
to <HI>take Arms.</HI> This was the Case, and this it∣sued;
in the <HI>Rising</HI> of <HI>Bothwell:</HI> Of which in its
Place.</P>
<P>These Troops were immediately dispers'd over
the <HI>whole</HI> Country: I mean that Part of the
Country where the Things were chiefly trans∣acted,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) the <HI>Western</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Shires.
They were impower'd to apprehend, and bring
dead, or alive, such <HI>Ministers</HI> as they had given
them by Name: And at length, they had a
Power to apprehend all People, that they had
Reason to suppose were present at any of those
Meetings, or were going to them, or coming
from them. This last Clause gave them such an
unlimited extensive Power, that no Person was
exempt from their Enquiry, and if they found
any Person upon the Road, that had but a <HI>BIBLE</HI>
in their Pockets, they took it for a sufficient
Proof, that they either had been at, or were
going to one of those <HI>Meetings;</HI> and accordingly
<PB N="180" REF="279"/>
they sent them to Prison, where they seldom
fail'd of finding some Pretence or other, to en∣snare
them, and draw them in to some Acknow∣ledgment
of what they call'd a Crime, so to
keep them in Custody: For, as the honest
People would not lye to save themselves, they
failed not to purge them with Questions, whe∣ther
they had been, or intended to be present
at any <HI>Field - Conventicles:</HI> And many Times
the People so question'd would boldly acknow∣ledge,
tho' to their own Hurt, That they <HI>both
had been at them, and intended as often as might be
to be present again at them,</HI> defying the Power of
their Enemies, and bidding them <HI>do their
Worst.</HI></P>
<P>By these Things the <HI>Prisons</HI> were fill'd with
great Numbers of Faithful Confessors; and
many were confin'd in the Island of the <HI>Bass,</HI>
the Castles of <HI>Dunnotter, Blackness,</HI> and other
unwholesome Places; where they perish'd with
Distempers, and in Misery, occasion'd by Want
of Conveniences, by Severity of Cold, and
Length of Time, and Others languished without
Hope, or at least, without Prospect of Deliver∣rance
17 or 18 Years, 'till their <HI>Persecutors</HI> were
supplanted by Heaven at the <HI>Glorious Revolution,</HI>
effected by King <HI>William.</HI> Many like wise were
banished in this Part of the <HI>Persecution,</HI> and
Hundreds, nay Thousands were driven from
their Dwellings, <HI>Out-law'd,</HI> and <HI>Intercommuned.</HI></P>
<P>The Reader is desir'd to observe now, that
the <HI>Persecutions of the Church of</HI> Scotland
may be divided into Two Parts, and they have
their respective <HI>Periods</HI> of Time. <HI>To wit,</HI> (1.)
<HI>The Persecution of the Whole PRESBYTERIAN
Church,</HI> as described from the Time of the Act,
<PB N="181" REF="280"/>
<HI>restoring EPISCOPACY, Anno</HI> 1662: Of
whieh Mention has been made. And (2.) The
<HI>Persecution of the</HI> Cameronian <HI>Presbyterians,</HI>
(so they were then call'd,) which begun at, or
immediately after the <HI>Declaration</HI> of <HI>Indulgence:
To wit,</HI> in the Year 1670. This <HI>Indulgence</HI>
was called a <HI>Declaration,</HI> because it was
not done by <HI>Act of Parliament,</HI> but by the King's
<HI>Council, upon a Letter from the King Himself:</HI>
And to give it an <HI>equal Sanstion as a Statuted Law,</HI>
an Act was immediately pass'd in the <HI>Parliament,</HI>
by which it was Enacted, That <HI>the Government
of the Church, and the Ordering thereof does
of Right belong to His Majesty, and His Successors,
by Vertue of His SUPREMACY, and is inherent in
the Crown, and that the King may set forth such
Constitutions concerning Ecclesiastic Matters, as He
shall find proper, which are to be Obey'd, and Observ'd
by all His Subjects as Law.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this <HI>Indulgence,</HI> those <HI>Ministers</HI> who sub∣mitted
to accept of <HI>Licences</HI> to preach from the
Bishop, and to take the <HI>Oaths</HI> therein prescribed;
<HI>To wit,</HI> of <HI>ALLEGIANCE and SƲPREMACY,
were allow'd to set up Meeting-Houses for Religious
Worship, and to exercise all the Parts of their Mini∣sterial
Office to such Congregations as gathered to them
for that Purpose.</HI> And it is acknowledge'd, that
in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>North</HI> Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> many,
perhaps, the greater Part of the <HI>Presbyterian
DISSENTERS</HI> did comply, and accept of
this Indulgence, esteeming it better so to
do, than to leave the People <HI>as Sheep without a
Shepherd;</HI> and better than to be utterly depriv'd
of the Means of Preaching the <HI>Gospel</HI> at all:
For, tho' they should have suffred the greatest
Extremities, and had been willing to have en∣dured
the worst their Enemies could inflict, yet
<PB N="182" REF="281"/>
could they not have had the least Opportunity to
have preached, or the People to have heard them
in those Parts, where the Country being fully
inhabited, and chiefly by their Enemies, they
would have been certain at all Times to have
been disappointed, and fallen upon.</P>
<P>But, there were a Body of People, especially
in the <HI>West</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> Parts, whose Zeal car∣ried
them beyond all such <HI>Compliances,</HI> and who
esteeming the accepting of the <HI>INDƲLGENCE,</HI>
as <HI>Homologating,</HI> (to use their own Words) their
<HI>solemnly abjur'd Prelacy,</HI> and detesting every thing
that look'd like <HI>a Yielding up the Cause of GOD,</HI>
as they really believed theirs to be, stood out,
and would by no Means accept of Deliverance
in a sinful Manner.</P>
<P>It is too long a Subject to enter upon in
these Memoirs, to set down the Reasons, that
one side gave for their complying with, and
the other for their rejecting this Indulgence; it is
sufficient to the Case in Hand, that these Men
declar'd they thought the Terms Sinful; that
the Good pretended, was by no means equivalent
to the Evil that was to be committed; that it
was against the Covenant, by which they were
engag'd to God, to endeavour to their utmost,
the Extirpation of Prelacy; that they ought to
suffer the greatest Torment, rather than to
commit the least Sin, and that as this was in
their Opinion a great Sin, they could not in Con∣science
comply with it.</P>
<P>What they deny'd or refused to do, may be
comprehended in these Heads, with the reasons
they have for it.</P>
<P>1. They would not accept of an Indulgence
for Worshiping God, by the Licence of the Bi∣shops;
because they said they had abjur'd Prelacy
in the Covenant, and had declared <HI>the Bishops</HI> to be
<PB N="183" REF="282"/>
Anti-scripturial and Anti-christian, and to take
License from them, was to homologate their Autho∣rity
as Legal, which they detested and abhorr'd.</P>
<P>2. They would not take the Oath, of Supre∣macy,
because they could not in Conscience
allow any King or Head of the Church but
<HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>3. They would not Pray for the King, or
Swear to him, because he was a Persecutor of
the Church, and thereby an Enemy to God,
because he had Renounced the Oath of God in
the Covenant, and till he had repented, they
would have nothing to do with him.</P>
<P>4. Being debarred all manner of Liberty to
Worship God in Publick, and on the severest
Penalties forbid to assemble themselves toge∣ther,
either in the Churches, or in private Fa∣milies;
and believing it at the same time their
Duty according to the Scripture, <HI>not to for sake
assembling</HI> &amp;c. They could not satisfy their Con∣sciences
to obey Man rather than God.</P>
<P>These Things however Condemned by others,
who thought the Suffering People strained their
Matters too high; were yet Principles, which
thole People could not in Conscience abate,
or go from; and it was apparent they
would lay down their Lives, rather than abate,
or go from them: And this makes the Pro∣ceedings
of the Council against them be justly
esteemed, the height of Persecution. Nor
were the methods taken with them, such as could
be justifed, either by the Laws of God or Man,
especially Christians, tho' their Principles had
been really worse, than their Enemies ever pre∣tended
they were: For they were treated not
only with all manner of Cruelty, Barbarity, and
Inhumanity, but with Treachery, Perfidy, and
breach of even the Laws of Nature: They were
<PB N="184" REF="283"/>
abandon'd to the Mercy of every common Soul∣dier,
to kill and destroy them, upon even Sus∣picion
of Guilt, without Tryal, Evidence, or
Examination; they were made Witnesses against
themselves, and against one another, and Me∣thods
were taken to Try Convict, and Execute
them in a few Moments, without Law, Order,
Judge or Magistrate.</P>
<P>The Merciless rage of their Persecutors, was
come to such a height, that they would frequently
contrive to surprize them, so as that they might
put them to Death, without giving them time
so much as to pray to God, as if they thought
their Rage could extend beyond Death,
and that if possible, they would punish
their Souls as well as their Bodies; and I think
it is no Breach of Charity to say, that if they
could have made an Act of Parliament, that
they should have had no Mercy shewn them
in the next World, any more than in this, they
would not have fail'd to have pass'd it: Few
Persecutions in the World, have ever been
Circumstanc'd with such particular marks of
Inveterate Malice, they have even Envyed them
the Prayers of others, and if upon their Tryals
any one had but said, <HI>Lord Comfort them,</HI> they
were sure to be taken up and question'd for
themselves.</P>
<P>Such Inhumanities have not been Parallel'd in
the World, as has been used here, particularly,
that when 250 of them were put on board a
Ship for Transportation, and the Ship was cast
away upon the Rocks, so hard hearted, so in∣humanly
Cruel was the Officer who Commanded,
that he would not suffer the Hatches to be
opened that they might be sav'd, tho' to be
still banish'd according to Sentence; but stood
<PB N="185" REF="284"/>
over them till they were all Drown'd in the
Hold of the Ship except 50 who Miraculously
escaped, some of whom are alive at the pub∣lishing
of this Account.</P>
<P>These however are Generals, I shall meet with
them all again in their Course: I return to the
Field Meetings, for it is of these and of the
People frequenting them, that all that is now to
be said is to be understood.</P>
<P>After the poor People had thus adjourn'd
their Meetings to the Hills <HI>as is said,</HI> and the
Council had obtain'd those Laws abovemention'd,
declaring it Imprisonment, Death, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to be
found at any of them, and Troops were
Levy'd, to put those Laws in Execution; there
could be nothing expected on any Side but
Blood, and the Fire of Persecution was but then
said to be Kindled.</P>
<P>The first Civil or pretendedly Legal Step
was an Act of Parliament, 2. <HI>Sess. 2. Parl. Cha.</HI> 2.
<HI>Anno</HI> 1670, by which every Person, of what
Quality, Age or Sex soever, was obliged to Answer
upon Oath, and depose all that they knew of
such Field Meetings, and of what Persons were
thereat? and to answer to the Questions that
should be ask'd them upon Oath, upon Pain
of Imprisonment, Fine, Corporal Punishment,
or Banishment, at the Pleasure of the Council.
By this Act, Fathers and Mothers were oblig'd
to Betray, and Accuse their own Children;
and Children co Betray and Accule their Pa∣rents;
Husbands their Wives, and Wives their
Husbands; and many for refusing thus to be∣tray
their nearest Relations, have been Trans∣ported
to the Plantations from their Country,
Relations, and Interest; where they have been
sold for Slaves, and have perished by the se∣veritg
<PB N="186" REF="285"/>
of Labour, violent Cold, or violent
Heat, not having been used to such hardships.</P>
<P>A Serious and Judicious Writer of those
Times, says, such Havock was made by the
cruelty of the Souldiers, and by the furious Ex∣ecutions
of their Arbitrary and Tyrannical
Laws, that greater could not be found in the
Reigns of <HI>Nero</HI> and <HI>Caligula Roman</HI> Emperors,
most infamous for Cruelty.</P>
<P>Nor were these Violences Exercised for a
little while, as in several of the most cruel of
the Primitive Persecutions was the Case; but for
Eighteen Years together, the poor People had
no Redress, no Relaxation, but that every Day,
matters grew worse and worse, and more and
more desperate; their Enemies always contri∣ving
some new and unpractis'd Severity, and
acting something never known before, in Order
more and more to exasperate and oppress them.
This Account of 18 Years <HI>Persecution</HI> is to be
Reckon'd from the Time of the <HI>Indulgence,</HI> or,
At least, from the Year after (<HI>viz.</HI>) 1670: But,
the whole <HI>Persecution</HI> continued 28 Years (<HI>viz.</HI>)
from <HI>May,</HI> the Beginning of the Year 1660,
being the first of the RESTORATION,
to <HI>November,</HI> the latter End of the Year 1688,
being the Beginning of the REVOLUTION.</P>
<P>Things were now come to the utmost Ex∣tremity,
and the Sufferers being treated thus
with all Manner of Cruelty, had, as is said, taken
to the <HI>Hills,</HI> where they worshipped GOD with
more Freedom, and with Gladness of Heart; but
not with much less Hazard at the last; for they
were then fallen upon as Rebels by Troops of
Dragoons who executed the Bloody Orders of the
Council with such Rage over the poor defence∣less
People, riding over the poor flying Women, and
<PB N="187" REF="286"/>
Children, and dragging them like Beasts up and
down the Fields, 'till they brought them to
Prisons; that it was no Wonder the Men took
Measures to meet together with more Safety to
themselves. From this Time it was resolved,
<HI>That seeing Self-Defence was a Natural Law, and
that every Man had a Right so preserve his own
Life in the Performance of any lawful Action, and
likewise that the Worship of God Was not only lawful,
but their indispensable Duty, which no human Power
ought to restrain, or had a Right to forbid; it was
lawful therefore for them to defend themselves from
Violence, and preserve their Liberty in the Exercise,
and during the Time of Worship: And therefore they
resolved, That at their said Field-Meetings, as many
of the young Men that had Fire-Arms, should come
arm'd, not to use Violence against any, but to resist
the Dragoons, in case they should fall upon the Meeting,
or lay bold of any of the People going to, or coming from
it.</HI></P>
<P>This was the Famous Resolve of the great
Meeting at <HI>LANERCK,</HI> and for a Time, was
some Surprize to the Persecutors. For, indeed,
after this they were often beaten back by the
Courage of much inferiour Numbers of the Peo∣ple,
notwithstanding their Rage and Fury: And
at other Times the Persecuted appeared to guard
their Meetings with such Numbers, and so skil∣fully
posted, that the Dragoons durst not attack
them: Tho' on all these Occasions the Persecuted
kept themselves on the Defensive, never offering
anymore, than to stand firm, facing their Enemies,
'till the poor frighted Women and Children were
seprated, and gotten safe from the Place.</P>
<P>I cannot refrain from giving some few In∣stances
of the Behaviour of these People, when
Power was in their Hands; which may serve to
<PB N="188" REF="287"/>
let Posterity see whether they were Rebellious
by their Inclination, or, whether they were
driven to take Arms in their Hands for their
own just Defence, or not: And to prove, that
even when it was in their Power to have cut
their Enemies in pieces, who well had deserv'd
it for their Cruelty; yet they contented them∣selves
with bare Rescuing their Brethren from
the Butchery of the Dragoons, and let the Mur∣therers
escape.</P>
<P>There had been a Meeting in the Fields, in
<HI>Nithisdale,</HI> not far from <HI>Drumlanrig</HI> Castle, the
Seat of the late D. of <HI>Queensberry.</HI> The Assembly
was very numerous, and there were about sixty
Men with Fire-Arms, who placed themselves at
convenient Distance, so as to keep off their E∣nemies,
if they should come to disturb the Ass∣embly,
'till the People might disperse: These
also had Scouts out every Way at great Distance
to discover, and give Notice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It was not
long before an Alarm was given, that <HI>They were
betray'd, and that two Parties of Dragoons were
marching to attack them.</HI> Upon this, the poor
People, as was always the Method, separated,
and went every one their own Way; so that the
Soldiers found them entirely disperst, and no
Meeting in Appearance, except of about 300, who
were gotten together, where their Men were
posted that had Arms; who presenting their
Pieces at the Dragoons from the side of a steep
Hill, where their Horses were useless, they did
not think fit to dismount, and attack them.</P>
<P>The Soldiers however grown furious, and en∣rag'd,
spread themselves over the Fields, in
Persuit of the poor straggling People, and seiz'd
several of them: And amongst the rest, they
unhappily fell upon six Men naked and unarm'd;
<PB N="189" REF="288"/>
one of whom was the Minister: These, they took
and after having abused them, bruised, and woun∣ded
them, tho' they offered no Resistance, they
bound, and dragg'd them along with them,
making the poor Men go on Foot at their
Horse-Heels, as fast as they rode. They car∣ry'd
these Prisoners directly for <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where
also they were sure to be put to Death as soon
as they arriv'd.</P>
<P>As the Ministers, on these Occasions, were
very free to hazard their Lives in the Work of
their Office, and for the Comfort and Edification
of their People: So the People again were re∣markable
for their Love to their Ministers, and
their Concern for their Preservation: No sooner
therefore was it known among them, that their
Minister was taken, but the Men began to gather
together in several Parties with their Arms. re∣solv'd,
whatever it cost, to rescue their Mini∣ster;
To this End they disperst themselves into all
the Ways by which they thought the Dragoons
might march, by which it happened, that the
smallest Number of them not being above 37
Men, who lay on the side of <HI>Entrekein</HI> Hill,
met with them, that being the Way the Enemy
really went with the Prisoners.</P>
<P>This <HI>Entrekein</HI> is a very steep, and dangerous
Mountain; nor could such another Place have been
easily found in the whole Country for their Pur∣pose;
and, had not the Dragoons been infatu∣ated
from Heaven, they would never have en∣tred
such a Pass, without well discovering the
Hill above them. The Road for above a Mile
goes winding, with a moderate Ascent on the
side of a very high, and very steep Hill, 'till on
the latter part, still ascending and the Height on
the left above them being still vastly great, the
<PB N="190" REF="289"/>
Depth on their right below them makes a prodi∣gious
Precipice, descending steep and ghastly into
a narrow deep Bottom, only broad enough for
the Current of Water to run that descends upon
hasty Rain: From this Bottom the Mountain rises
i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> stantly again steep as a recipice on the other side
to a stupenduous Height. The passage on the
side of the first Hill, by which, as I said, the
Way creeps gradually up, is narrow; so that
two Horsemen can but ill pass in Front: And,
if any Disorder should happen to them, so as
that they step but a litt<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e a-wry, they are in
Danger of falling down the said Precipice on
their right, where there would be no stopping
'till they came to the Bottom. And the Writer
of this has seen, by the Accident only of a
sudden Frost, which had made the Way slip∣pery,
3 or 4 Horses at a Time of Travellers, or
Carryers lying in that dismal Bottom; which slip∣ping
in their Way, have not been able to recover
themselves, but have fallen down the Precipice,
and rolled to the Bottom, perhaps, tumbling
20 Times over, by which it is impossible but
they must be broken to pieces, e'er they come
to stop.</P>
<P>In this Way the Dragoons were blindly march∣ing
2 and 2 with the Minister and 5 Countrymen,
whom they had taken Prisoners, and were hauling
them along to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> the Front of them being
near the Top of the Hill, and the rest reaching all
along the steep part; when on a sudden they heard
a Man's Voice calling to them from the side of the
Hill on their left a great Height above them.</P>
<P>It was misty, as indeed it is seldom other∣wise
on the Height of that Mountain; so
that no Body was seen at first: But the Com∣manding
Officer hearing some Body call, halted,
<PB N="191" REF="290"/>
and call'd aloud, <HI>What d'ye want, and who are ye?</HI>
He had no sooner spoke, but 12 Men came in
sight upon the side of the Hill above them, and
the Officer call'd again, <HI>What are ye?</HI> and bad <HI>Stand:</HI>
One of the 12 answer'd, by giving the Word of
Command to his Men, <HI>Make ready;</HI> and then
calling to the Officer, said, <HI>Sir, Will ye deliver
our Minister?</HI> The Officer answer'd with an
Oath, <HI>No, Sir, and ye were to be damn'd.</HI> At
which the Leader of the Countrymen fir'd im∣mediately,
and aim'd so true at him, tho' the
Distance was pretty great, that he shot him
thro' the Head, and immediately he fell from
his Horse; His Horse fluttering a little with
the Fall of his Rider, fell over the Precipice,
rolling to the Bottom, and was dash'd to pieces.</P>
<P>The rest of the 12 Men were stooping to give
Fire upon the Body; when the next Command∣ing
Officer call'd to them to <HI>hold their Hands,</HI>
and desir'd <HI>a Truce.</HI> It was apparent, that the
hole Body was in a dreadful Consternation;
Not a Man of them durst stir a Foot, or offer
fire a Shot. And had the 12 Men given
Fire upon them, the first Volley, in all Proba∣bility,
would have driven 20 of them down the
side of the Mountain into that Dreadful Gulph
at the Bottom.</P>
<P>To add to their Consternation, their 2 Scouts
who rode before, gave them Notice, <HI>That there
appear'd another Body of Arm'd Countrymen at
the Top of the Hill in their Front;</HI> which how∣ever
was nothing but some Travellers, who,
seeing Troops of Horse coming up, stood there
to let them pass, the Way being too narrow
to go by them: It's true, there were about 25
more of the Countrymen in Arms, tho' they had
not appeared, and they had been sufficient, if
<PB N="192" REF="291"/>
they had thought fit, to have cut this whole
Body of Horse in pieces.</P>
<P>But, the Officer having ask'd a <HI>Parley,</HI> and
demanded, <HI>What it was they would have?</HI> they
replied again, <HI>Deliver our Minister▪ Well Sir,</HI>
says the Officer. <HI>Ye's get your Minister, and ye
will promise to forbear firing: Indeed we'll for∣bear,</HI>
says the good Man, <HI>We desire to hurt
none of ye: But Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>Belike ye have
mare Prisoners: Indeed have we,</HI> says the Officer,
<HI>and ye mon deliver them all,</HI> says the honest Man▪
<HI>Well,</HI> says the Officer, <HI>Ye shall have them then.</HI>
Immediately the Officer calls to Bring forward
<HI>the Minister:</HI> But the Way was so narrow and
crooked he could not be brought up by a
Horseman, without Danger of putting them
into Disorder: So that the Officer bad them
<HI>Loose him, and let him go;</HI> which was done:
so the Minister stept up the Hill a step or
two, and stood still: Then the Officer said
to him, <HI>Sir, and I let you go, I expect you promise
to oblige your People to offer no Hindrance to our
March.</HI> The Minister promis'd them, <HI>He would
do so. Then go Sir,</HI> said he, <HI>You owe your Life
to this Damn'd Mountain. Rather Sir,</HI> said
the Minister, <HI>to that GOD that made this
Mountain.</HI> When their Minister was come
to them, their Leader call'd again to the
Officer, <HI>Sir, We want yet the other Prisoners.</HI> The
Officer gave Orders to the Rear, where they
were, and they were also deliver'd. Upon
which the Leader began to march away, when
the Officer call'd again, <HI>But hold, Sir,</HI> says he,
<HI>Ye promised to be satisfied, if ye had your Prisoners:
I expect you'll be as good as your Word. Indeed
shall I,</HI> says the Leader, <HI>I am just marching∣away;</HI>
it seems he did not rightly understand
<PB N="193" REF="292"/>
the Officer. <HI>Well, Sir, bur,</HI> says the Officer, <HI>I
expect you call off those Fellows you have posted at
the Head of the Way. They belong not to us,</HI> says
the honest Man, <HI>they are unarm'd People,waiting
'till you pass by. Say you so,</HI> said the Officer,
<HI>Had I known that, you had not gotten your Men so
Cheap, or have come off so free: Says the Country
men,</HI> And ye are for Battle, Sir, We are ready for
you still, if you think you are able for us, ye may
trye your Hands; we'll quit the Truce, if you like.
<HI>NO,</HI> says the Officer, <HI>I think ye be brave Fellows,
e'en gang your Gate.</HI></P>
<P>The Case was very clear, and the Officer saw
it plainly: Had those 37 Men, for that was
the most of their Number, fir'd but twice upon
them, and then fallen in Sword in Hand, or
with the Club of their Musquets; not a Man of
them could have escaped; Nay, they must
have destroy'd one another; for they would
have thrust one another down the Hill with
but the least Offer to move, or turn, or do any
Thing but go forward: Nor could any Dragoon
apply himself to any Thing but to govern his
Horse, so as to prevent his falling over the
Edge of the Way down the Hill: Indeed the
persecuted had them all at Mercy, and had
they commanded them all to lay down their
Arms, and surrender themselves Prisoners at
Discretion, they must have done it. But these
testify'd by their Moderation, that they sought
no Man's Blood; and that they took Arms meerly
for their own Defence, and yet four of these were
afterwards Executed for this Fact.</P>
<P>This little Affair made a great Noise. The
Officer of the Dragoons was threatened with a
Council of War: And whether he was not
broke for Cowardise I am not certain; but this
<PB N="194" REF="293"/>
I am certain of that had the best of them been
upon the Spot, they must have done the same,
or have resolv'd to have made a Journey head∣long
andown such a Hill, as would have chill'd
the Blood of a Man of good Courage but to have
thought of. As to the Mistake, of not discovering
the place before they entred the Pass. That
Fault lay upon the Officer who was kill'd, who
had already paid dear for his Omission.</P>
<P>There was another Occasion, in which the
persecuted People had let the Soldiers know,
that they were not always to expect their Blood
so cheap as they had formerly had it. And
this had been much to their Advantage, had
they not carry'd it on afterwards to an Enter∣prize,
which neither their Numbers, or Cir∣cumstances
were by any means equal to.</P>
<P><HI>John Graham,</HI> Laird of <HI>Claverhouse,</HI> the same
who was famous afterwards by the Title of
Visc. of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and was kill'd at the Battle
of <HI>Gillicranky,</HI> in the Year 1689. was a Furious
Persecutor, and an implacable Enemy of these
poor innocent People upon all Occasions: He
had, among the rest of his Cruelties, barba∣rously
murther'd several of the persecuted People
with his own Hands, as after this Action he did
several more, particularly one of his own Name,
(<HI>viz.) Graham</HI> of <HI>Galloway,</HI> who fled from him
out of a House where the said <HI>Claverhouse</HI> had
persu'd and beset him: The young Man
being forced to quit the House, and run to
save his Life, <HI>Claverhouse</HI> rid after him and o∣vertook
him; and tho' the young Man offer'd
to surrender, and begg'd him to save his Life,
he shot him dead with his Pistol. This, with
several other like barbarous Things he practised
upon the poor persecuted People. Of which
hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="294"/>
There was a very great Meeting of the per∣secuted
People in the Fields near <HI>Loudoun</HI>-Hill;
where, by Report, many Thousands were met
together. I think, they had intended to have
the Communion, and to have made it a Day,
both of Humiliation and Rejoycing; a Day of
Humiliation for the Apostacy of their Brethren,
and for the Sins of the Land: And a Day of
solemn Joy for the Liberty of, and Affection of
the People to the Service and Worship of God.</P>
<P>As it was a very great Meeting, so the Num∣ber
of Men was greater that were in Arms for
their Defence, than was usual on other and or∣dinary
Occasions; there being about 200 Men
with Fire-Arms, prepar'd for, and resolv'd to
do their Parts with the Enemy, if they came,
as was threaten'd, to disturb them.</P>
<P>The Laird of <HI>Claverhouse</HI> having Information
of this Assembly, prepar'd to attack them; and
had boasted what Havock he would make of
the <HI>Cameronians</HI> on that Occasion: <HI>It seems he said,</HI>
that he heard they had some Fire-Men among
them, but if they offered to make one shot at his
Men, he would save the Council and Courts of
Justice the Trouble of prosecuting his Prisoners
with the Formality of the Law, for he would
immediately hang up every one that fell into
his Hands, if he should take 500. Is was con∣fidently
reported, that some of the Soldiers of
his own Troops give private Notice of this,
and of the measures he had taken for assaulting
the Meeting: As also of the Menaces and
Boasts he had made. Compassion indeed might
move some of the Soldiers; for tho' generally spea∣king,
the Soldiers were barbarous and cruel as their
Officers could desire, yet oftentimes it was found
they were less so than their Officers.</P>
<P><PB N="196" REF="295"/>
However it was, the persecuted had receiv'd
Information, that <HI>Clarverhouse</HI> with 300 Dragoons
was resolv'd to surround the Meeting, and put
them all to the Sword. This Account came not
to them till after they were assembled, and their
Worship was actually begun; whereupon the Men
who had the Guard of the Meeting far from being
surprised, consulted together what they should do,
whether they should disperse for that Time, and
appoint another Meeting at another Place and
Time, or what Course they should take.</P>
<P>They had not many Hours to deliberate, much
less to put in Execution what they should resolve
on. But, in a Word: It was concluded the People
should be desir'd to sit still, and compose them∣selves,
whatever should happen, leaving the
Event to the Providence and good Pleasure of
God; and that they should send for Help to
all the neighbouring Places, And in the mean
Time to meet <HI>Claverhouse</HI> and his Men, if they
came to attack them; and do as God should
direct.</P>
<P>Upon mustering their Men, they found their
Number encreased to about 250 Men well arm'd,
besides several that came in afterwards: And
before the Action began it's thought they were
near 400. The Assembly was great, and the
People sate all on the Ground on the side of
a steep Hill: The Minister preaching to them
from a little Tent near the Bottom of the Hill.
The Laird of <HI>Claverhouse</HI> with his Dragoons came
on with great Fury, like a Troop of Wolves
to fell upon a naked and defenceless Flock of
Sheep, and not expecting any Resistance, kept
no Scouts out before him; when on a sudden they
were challeng'd and bid <HI>Stand,</HI> by an Out-Guard
of the persecuted; who finding them
<PB N="197" REF="296"/>
come on, fir'd at them, and retreated to the
main Body. But the Dragoons were a second
Time surprised, when they found a large Body
of Men advantageously posted, the first Line of
whom fir'd a Volley of shot upon them, and kill'd
and wounded them 16 or 17 Men, and some Horses.</P>
<P>This brought them to halt, and prepare for
Battle: They took not much Time for it,
but came on again with great Fury, but found that
the persecuted had a large Ditch cast up in
their Front, with a low old ruined Wall, which
serv'd them as a <HI>Parapet,</HI> from whence they fir'd
with more Security, and so well they plyed them
with their shot, that after 2 or 3 Attempts
they gave it over, and retreated, having lost
about 30 Men kill'd and wounded; and found
that they had to do with Men resolv'd to die,
and sell their Lives as dear as they could. There
were some of the persecuted who signaliz'd
themselves upon this Occasion; and who leap∣ing
over their Works advanc'd so near them,
as that once a young Gentleman laid Hands
on the Bridle of <HI>Claverhouse</HI>'s Horse, and had
certainly taken him Prisoner, if he had been
well seconded. This was Mr. <HI>Cleeland,</HI> who 18
Years after was Lieut. Col. to the Earl of <HI>Angus</HI>'s
Regiment, which was rais'd among these very
People at the <HI>Revolution,</HI> and was call'd, <HI>the</HI> Ca∣meronian
<HI>Regiment,</HI> being raised and compleated
in one Day without Beat of Drum. This was
the same Regiment, now call'd <HI>Preston,</HI>'s which
was at the Attack of the late Rebels at <HI>Prestons</HI>
in <HI>Lancashire.</HI> And this Gentleman Lieut. Col.
<HI>Cleeland</HI> was unhappily kill'd at <HI>Dunkeld</HI> against
the same <HI>Claverhouse,</HI> then Visc. <HI>Dundee.</HI></P>
<P>This Action began to make the persecuted
terrible to the Council: And had they con∣tinued
<PB N="198" REF="297"/>
to have acted thus upon the Defensive only,
it was thought they would in Time have ruin'd
the Troops of their <HI>Persecutors.</HI> But their push∣ing
Things to Extremity afterwards ruin'd them
and all their Friends.</P>
<P>It is easie to believe, that this Check enrag'd
the Soldiery to the last Degree: Many of the
Persons who had thus appeared being known;
were after this oblig'd to flye, for Fear of falling
into the Hands of their Persecutors, but the
Heads of the Actors, finding there was no going
back to their own Houses, they unhappily re∣solved
to keep together: <HI>And this begun the Re∣bellion
of</HI> Bothwell-Bridge: For, encourag'd by
Success, and made desperate by the Extremities
they, were driven to, they in less than four Days
found themselves near 2000 Men, very well arm'd
and furnish'd; upon this they march'd to <HI>Glasgow,</HI>
and were encreased in a few Days more to be∣tween
6 and 7000 Men.</P>
<P>Their Friends now began to be in pain for
them, because <HI>England</HI> was more immediately
concern'd to reduce them now, as well as <HI>Scot∣land.</HI>
And the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI> was sent down
from thence to command the Army.</P>
<P>This was, I say, that well known Insurrection of
<HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge: And it was call'd <HI>Rebellion,</HI> because
they Declar'd against the King: They were after∣wards
attack'd by the D. of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> while they
were irresolute, and consulting whether to yield
or defend themselves, and were defeated.</P>
<P>It is not any part of the present Work to give
the Particulars of this Rising. From the Action
mention'd to the Defeat, it is sufficient to ob∣serve,
That in this Action there was between
3 and 400 kill'd, and about 1200 taken Priso∣ners:
The rest escaped, and disperst themselves
<PB N="199" REF="298"/>
as well as they could; nor were the Persecutors
at all satisfy'd with the Duke of <HI>Monmouth</HI>'s Con∣duct,
who refused, at their Request, to let the
poor People be persued and massacred by the
Dragoons: Not failing to make a Complaint
against him to the Court of <HI>England</HI> on that
Head, and to have it improv'd to his Disadvantage.</P>
<P>Many were the unhappy Consequences of this
Insurrection, as well to those who were not con∣cern'd
in it, as to those who were: For tho'
the Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> as General of the Army,
restrain'd the Rage of the Soldiery as above from
the Inhumanity of a Hot-Blood Execution; yet his
Command ceasing, and himself returning imme∣diately
after to Court, the Persecutors took
pains to shew the World, that they could act
with more Cruelty in Cold Blood, than Men of
Honour, and of Christian Clemency could find
in their Hearts to suffer, even in the Heat of
Victory.</P>
<P>For now they gave themselves a full Swing
in all their Bloody Measures, letting loose the
most Bloody Agents of Tyranny to execute what∣ever
their private Rage, as well as publick could
dictate to them: Under the Pretence of rooting
out Rebellion, and of executing Justice, they per∣sued
the Innocent as well as the Guilty; and
put to Death Hundreds of People by all man∣ner
of Cruelties; and on the meanest Pretences
imaginable: Nay often without any Pretence
at all, and that in the most Barbarous manner.</P>
<P>It is impossible here to enter into the Parti∣culars
of the Murthers committed upon this oc∣casion.
And if I should take all the verbal Re∣lations,
that I have met with in conversing a∣mong
those, that were Eye-Witneses of the
Cruelties of that Time, it would exceed, if we
<PB N="200" REF="299"/>
compare the Smallness of the Country, and
Numbers of the People concern'd▪ I say it would
exceed all that ever was set down in any Hi∣story
of Persecutions, whether of <HI>Popish,</HI> or
<HI>Heathen</HI> Tyrants.</P>
<P>The first Year after this Insurrection, was
wholly taken up in searching after, and persuing
those who were actually in the Army; but had,
by the Mismanagement, as they call'd it, of the
Duke of <HI>Monmouth,</HI> made their Escape. For,
by the Way, their Desire was, that when the
Body that defended the Bridge were defeated,
and the rest began to disperse and flye,
they should have been all surrounded, and cut
in pieces, or persu'd, and no Quarter given
them, 'till not a Man of them had been left to
carry News to <HI>Glasgow</HI> of the Defeat. And this
having fail'd, they resolv'd, if possible, to find
out every Man that had been at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and
put them to Death wherever they found them,
upon the very Spot.</P>
<P>In Order to this, they neither requir'd much
Evidence of the Fact, nor took the pains to
examine the Persons themselves: But, if it was
but said to them, that such a Man, or such Men
had been at <HI>Bothwell-Brigg,</HI> they immediately
sent the Soldiers to their Houses, who were to
ask them no Questions, but seize upon them,
drag them just out of the Doors, and shoot them
dead in a Moment. How many poor innocent
Men, after protesting in the solemnest manner,
<HI>That they had not been any Way concern'd in the</HI>
Bothwell <HI>Affair,</HI> have they shot to Death with
those Protestations in their Mouths! and when
they have fallen on their Knees, and begg'd but
for 2 Minutes Time to recommend their Souls
to GOD, have deny'd them, and shot them
<PB N="201" REF="300"/>
kneeling as they were, with that Request in their
Mouths.</P>
<P>It would make any Christian Man's Heart
tremble to read the Blasphemies, the Oaths,
the Cursings, and the Insultings of those People,
over the poor Men and their Families, when
they dragg'd them thus out of the Arms of
their Wives and Children, to Massacre them.</P>
<P>Add to this, the Usage others meet with in
Order to oxtort Confessions from them of their
being at <HI>Bothwell-Brigg</HI> Rebellion; obliging Men
by Horrible Tortures to accuse themselves, and
weak Women and Children to accuse their
Husbands, Fathers, Brothers, and nearest Re∣lations;
putting Fire-matches between their
Fingers, or under their Joints; stripping stark
naked the most modest and tender Women
and Children, and thrusting them out in the
Extremity of Cold; and a Thousand other Vi∣olences,
too many to give an Account of, in
Order to discover those who were at this In∣surrection
of <HI>Bothwell.</HI></P>
<P>Of the Prisoners taken at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> and exe∣cuted
for Rebellion; I shall say the less, be∣cause
putting Men to Death who are taken in Arms is nothing but what is usual in such cases:
Not but that as the occasion of that Insurrec∣tion
was meerly the Cruelty and Violence of
Persecution for Conscience. We must account
those who were executed in cold Blood after∣wards,
as all dying by the Hand of Persecution,
and for the Cause of Religion; And this was
fully demonstrated by Mr. <HI>John King,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>John Kid,</HI> 2 Ministers taken in the Action at
<HI>Bothwell,</HI> and put to Death at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> on that
Account.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="301"/>
But when we come to speak of the Usage
given to the rest of the Prisoners, who they did
think fit to put to Death by the Hangman:
There we shall see the Spirit of Persecution
in the Abstract; and such Articles of Cruelty
as are not to be equall'd in <HI>Dioclesian</HI> or <HI>Max∣iminian;</HI>
such as are not to be found in the <HI>Irish</HI>
Massacre,or perhaps in any of the most Bloody and
Barbarous Persecutors. No, not in D' <HI>Alva</HI> him∣self;
or even in the <HI>Spanish Inquisition.</HI></P>
<P>There was as is said, about 1200 Prisoners,
few more, or less, taken at <HI>Bothwell.</HI> These
were in general stript by the Soldiers of what
Cloaths they had upon them, that were any Thing
valuable, and driven like a Herd of Beasts, bound
two and two to <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> where they were
kept several Weeks in a Church-yard wall'd in,
being strictly guarded, and allow'd no Lodging but
the Earth; neither any Covering but the Heavens;
either to shelter them from Wet, Cold, Sun or
Wind, altho' many of them were very sore
wounded. After this trifling Severity, a pretended
Mercy was extended to them, <HI>viz.</HI> That such of
them as would sign a Bond condemning their
whole Cause, acknowledging it to be Rebellion,
declaring it unlawful to Take Arms against the
King upon any Pretence whatsoever; and bind∣ing
themselves in a Penalty not to do so at any
Time thereafter were let go.</P>
<P>Many took this Declaration, and sign'd this
Bond, being not able to endure the Severity of
that Usage which they were exposed to in the
Church-yard, which however others call'd
Trifling. But many of them refused to accept of
Deliverance, upon such Terms as were against
their Principles, and as trampled upon the Blood
of their Brethren who had dy'd in that Quarrel▪
<PB N="203" REF="302"/>
These were near 400; and the <HI>Council</HI> not thinking
it proper to set the Hangman to Work upon them
all; above 50 having already been put to Death,
found out new and unheard of Ways of Mur∣thering
the greatest Part of them altogether;
About 300 of them having receiv'd a general
Sentence of Transportation to the <HI>English</HI> Colonies
in <HI>America;</HI> a Ship was found which as was pre∣tended
was bound to <HI>Jamaica,</HI> or rather was hir'd
by the Government to Transport these poor Vic∣tims
to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> where they were to be sold as
Slaves. On board this Vessel these People were
ship'd. Some have ventur'd to tell us, That so
great a Number could not possibly have gone to
<HI>Jamaica</HI> in that Ship; That the Vessel was by no
Means able to have carry'd fresh Water and ne∣cessary
Provisions for so great a Number, and so
long a Voyage. And moreover, upon Exa∣mination
we have been told that it did appear,
That no proportion of Provisions for such a
Number and such a Voyage was in the Ship at
that Time: All which, if true, serve to prove,
That what was afterwards wickedly done was the
Horrid Contrivance and Bloody Instructions of
the Persecutors, who had resolv'd the Destru∣ction
of the poor Sufferers whatever it cost.</P>
<P>The Ship sail'd, as above, and whether by
Stress of Weather, Negligence or Wickedness,
it is not material; neither could the poor Pri∣soners
who were lock'd under Hatches judge of
it. But this is certain, that coming near the
Northermost part of <HI>Scotland</HI> near the <HI>Orkneys,</HI>
the Ship was driven on shoar amongst the
Rocks, and stuck fast. The Ship's Crew sav'd
themselves, and all that belong'd to them; and
all the Prisoners, had they been allow'd to shift
for themselves, would have been sav'd with Ease
<PB N="204" REF="303"/>
enough; but the Officer set over them would
not suffer the Hatches to be opened, neither could
any Entreaty prevail upon him to let one Soul of
them out, 'till the Ship being dashed to Pieces,
they were all of them drowned in the Hold, ex∣cept
only, that an Honest Seaman, seeing, and be∣ing
struck with Horror at so Barbarous an Act;
ventur'd his Life to go on Board, and with an
Axe cutting thro' the Deck of the Vessel got
Forty nine of them out alive; the rest being
about Two Hundred and fifty perished to∣gether.
After this Piece of Cruelty is related,
I think I need make no Apology for having said,
That the Reign of <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> or any of the most
Cruel Persecutors of God's Church could not
match it: For these were Men delivered, Men to
whom Life was granted; after the Decimations
and Drafts made out of them for the Gibbet and
Scaffold were over, these were sentenc'd to Trans∣portation;
but given up to be Murther'd in the
most Inhumane and most Unprecedented Man∣ner,
such as I believe no History can shew the
like of.</P>
<P>Another Ship which had 60 or more of these
Banish'd Men put on board her, whereof several
were Ministers, and being oblig'd by the Act of
Navigation, really for she was bound for <HI>Jamaica</HI>
to go first <HI>England</HI> there by the Good Provi∣dence
of God, some Misunderstanding happening
between the Owners and Freighters of the Vessel,
upon the Terms of Charter-Party, the Ship was
not permitted to go the Voyage; and the poor
Sufferers got their Liberty, no Thanks to their
Persecutors.</P>
<P>There was near an Hundred others Transpor∣ted
in several Ships; some to one Country, some
to another; besides about 30 of the same <HI>Both-well-Brigg</HI>
<PB N="205" REF="304"/>
Prisoners, that dy'd in Prison either
of their Wounds, or otherwise by Distempers
contracted in their Confinement, and by the
Cruelty of their Keepers.</P>
<P>But this was not an End of the <HI>Bothwell-</HI> Bridge
Affair: For, as I said before, it was made for
some Years the Subject of the Strictest Inquisition;
and Abundance of poor People were Murther'd in
Cold Blood by the Persecutors on Pretence of
their having been at that Rebellion; as shall ap∣pear
in its Place.</P>
<P>In the Time of these Transactions the Arch-Bishop
of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, the most Fierce and Cruel
Persecutor of the Good People aforesaid; and
One, who, as was reported, had declared it as
his Opinion, That they were not a People fit to
live; but ought to be extirpated from the Face
of the Earth, was himself cut off by the Hands
of some Men, whose Zeal carrying them beyond
their Patience, took upon them this Execution,
as a Thing they had a Right to, as they suppo∣sed;
there being no Way to obtain Publick
Justice any other Way.</P>
<P>There have been several Accounts given in
Publick of this Man's Death; the Truth and Im∣partiality
of which I have much Reason to que∣question,
not only because I have heard it other
ways related; but because those Accounts have
manifest Contradictions in them, both as to the
Manner and Circumstances of the Fact, and as
to the Persons concern'd in it; neither shall I
say any more than this for the Relation here set
down, than that it came immediately from the
Mouth of one of the Persons concern'd in it;
and shall be repeated as near as possible in the
very Words.</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="305"/>
“We were (says' this Person) a poor People
made desperate by the Violence of our Perse∣cutors;
and still more so for Want of Oppor∣tunity
and Strength to resist them by Force;
which in Case of such manifest Injustice as we
daily receiv'd, we had very much Will to do,
and believ'd was not only lawful, but our
Duty: And on this Principle we acted before
at <HI>Pentland,</HI> and afterwards at <HI>Bothwell;</HI> which
we believe were very Lawful and Justifiable
Actions; however, it pleased not the Lord to
give us Success therein. In the Persuit of this
Opinion, it was proposed at a Meeting, whe∣ther
we being therefore, tho' supprest by Power
in a State of War, with our Persecutors, who had
illegally vow'd our Extirpation; it were not law∣ful
for us to destroy them by Surprize, or by at∣tacking
them as well a-part, as together, where∣ever
we could find them; and it was unani∣mously
agreed, That it was Lawful. Next it
was proposed, That whereas all Appeal to the
Publick Justice being deny'd us; and all Re∣medy
against our Oppressions, That is to say,
such as the Civil Magistrate ought to yield us,
being render'd impossible, we might, and ought
endeavour to execute that Justce which God
Himself had Denounced against Murtherers; and
which God had by His Own Law deputed to
the next of <HI>Kin.</HI> That the Persons here put
to Death were Murther'd, nay even Butcher'd
many of them without so much as any Pretence
to the Legal Forms, and ordinary Course
of Justice, being Kill'd in Cold Blood by
the Raging Soldiers, or by Bloody minded
Persecutors, back'd and supported by the said
Soldiers; and this by meer Surprize, and Ra∣venous
Unguided Rage, being equal to Ass∣sination,
<PB N="207" REF="306"/>
or rather something like being de∣vour'd
by Wild Beasts or Savages.”</P>
<P>“That upon such as Murther'd without Law,
Justice was to be Executed without Law, and
the Sword of God was in every Injur'd Man's
Hand to Execute the Divine Justice on such;
no Justice being also to be had from Men, those
who bore the Sword, not bearing it in vain only
but joyning themselves to, protecting, and
aiding these Murtherers, and therefore bearing
equal Guilt <HI>art and part</HI> with them.”</P>
<P>“This likewise was resolv'd upon in the Af∣firmative;
whereupon we who were then pre∣sent,
and whose Souls were fir'd with Zeal for
God's Glory, resolv'd with <HI>Phineas</HI> to Execute
Justice on those who had thus lifted up their
Hand against the Lord's People, wherever they
might be found; and to place our selves in
the Room and Authority of the Avenger of
Blood for our Innocent Brethren, who were de∣stroy'd
and cruelly Massacred for the Cause of
God and the Testimony of a Good Conscience.”</P>
<P>“In this our Zeal, and fortify'd with such
Considerations as these, 5 Men of our Number
Arming our selves, plac'd our selves in Am∣bush,
with Design to Execute God's Justice
upon the Laird of, a Cruel and
Bloody Persecutor of God's People; and who
had, not many Days before, put to Death, se∣veral
of our Brethren in the Province of <HI>Fife▪</HI>
This was our lntent, neither had we at that Time,
any Thought or Expectation of any other, when
we were surpriz'd with an Account from one
of our Number who was at a Distance; that
the Arch-Enemy of God and his People, the
Prelate of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, was passing on the
Road in his Coach.”</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="307"/>
“It was immediately suggested to us, that al∣beit
we had missed of the Man who we had
sought for; yet God had by a Wonderful
Providence delivered the Great and Capital
Enemy of his Church into our Hands; and
that it was a Visible Call to us from Heaven
not to let him escape: That he had been a
Notorious Persecutor of God's People, and a
Vile Murtherer of our Brethren; particularly
in that, when the King Himself sent his Com∣mands
to the Council in the Year 1666 after
<HI>Pentland</HI> Rising, That no more should be put
to Death; which Command was sent in Wri∣ting
directed to the said Privy Council, and
was deliver'd to the said Bishop: yet that he
had kept the said Written Order in his Pocket
`till the last 10 Persons mentioned in this Work
<HI>p.</HI> 166, who were then in Prison, were put to
Death; and that now was the Time when that
Scripture was to be executed by them, <HI>He who
spilleth Man's Blood by Man shall his Blood be
spilt;</HI> And that they ought not only to believe
that God had deliver'd him up into their Hands;
but that if they let him, escape it should be re∣quired
of them and of their Brethren, as in the
Case of King <HI>Ahab, 1 Kings 20, 42. Because
thou hast let go out of thy Hand a Man who I ap∣pointed
to utter Destruction; therefore, thy Life
shall go for his Life, and thy People for his
People.”</HI></P>
<P>“Fortify'd with these Principles, and parti∣cularly
with this Thought, <HI>viz.</HI> how won∣derfully
God had deliver'd this Great Enemy
into our Hand; we resolv'd that he should
nor escape. However, one of our Number
declined acting therein, having a private Rea∣son
against his bearing part in this Work; but
<PB N="209" REF="308"/>
not prevailing with us to desist from our Reso∣lution,
which we thought we had a Call from
Heaven to finish, he withdrew from us, stand∣ing
at a great Distance, so as to have no Hand
in the Action; in which Case the Hand of God
was farther remarkably seen by the Conse∣quence:
For, that none of us ever fell into
the Hands of the Enemy, or were put to Death
for this Fact, but that one Person, <HI>viz.</HI> Hack∣ston
of <HI>Rathillet</HI> who really had no Share in the
Work, but refused to joyn with us therein
as before.”</P>
<P>“Having resolv'd, <HI>as is said,</HI> That this Ene∣my
should not escape the Judgment of God by
our Hands; we rode after him, and coming up
to the Coach, quickly stopped the same, and
disarming his Servants, we gave him Notice of
our Resolutions, letting him know his Offen∣ces;
and in serious Terms exhorting him to
give Glory to God, by Cofessing his Guilt,
and that he would repent heartily for the
Wickedness of his Ways, and the Innocent
Blood that he had shed; for that, now his
Time was come to dye for the same.”</P>
<P>“It was some Time e'er we could convince
him, That we were in Earnest resolv'd to put
him to Death; and he seemed to smile at what
we had said about the Wickedness of his Life:
His Daughter also who was with him in the
Coach, railed on us with much Evil Language.
But thereafter, causing her to come forth of
the Coach, we let him know, that his Mo∣ments
were very few; that we would wait for
him yet a tittle while, and exhorted him
not to trifle with his Soul, but to call upon
God for Mercy: After which, seeing us in∣deed
in Earnest, he began to entreat for Life:
<PB N="210" REF="309"/>
But we soon let him know, we were not to be
put by our Purpose for any Entreaties that
could be used, and that there was no Mercy
to be shown to him, who had shown no Mer∣cy.
Hereupon he began to think of Death.
But <HI>here just the very Words of the Person who
related the Story,</HI> Behold! <HI>God did not give
him the Grace to pray to him without the Help of
a Book.</HI> But he pull'd out of his Pocket a
small Book, and began to read over some
Words to himself, which filled us with A∣mazement
and Indignation. However, wait∣ing
some Time, and then calling again upon
him to commend his Soul to God's Mercy,
for that he should immediately dye; we fir'd
upon him with our Pistols: When finding he
was not yet dead, and remembring that it had
been reported, that he had used Sorcery, in
Order to defend his Body, and that he was
invulnerable; and withal to rid him of Life
with as little Torture as we might, we slew
him with our Swords, and departed.”</P>
<P>This Relation of the Action of coming from the
Mouth of one of the Actors, has not only that
Authority for its Currency; but even seems in
its self to be most consonant with all the other
Accounts of it which have been made publick;
and is believ'd to be a very Just and Faithful
Account, both of the Killing the Bishop, and of
the Circumstances going before it.</P>
<P>The Reason why this Account is made pub∣lick
in this Place, tho' some Time after the Fact,
is on the following Account.</P>
<P>The Spirit of Persecution was now come to
the Height, and the Persecutors seem'd to have
exerted themselves to the uttermost. The com∣mon
Methods of Cruelty in putting to Death
<PB N="211" REF="310"/>
by Process and by Forms of Law were exhausted,
and they behoved to find out a more summary
Way to proceed; for there were Persons to be
destroy'd, against whom they had nothing to
alledge, nor any Proof to be made against them
of any Fact. And it was necessary to find out
some Way or other, first to make the whole
Body guilty, and then to make Men their own
Accusers, charging themselves with belonging
to the Body or Society, by owning the Prin∣ciples
upon which they acted.</P>
<P>This is that unheard of Part, which consti∣tutes
this Persecution to be the most Inhuman
of all the Persecutions which we read of, ei∣ther
before or since the Primitive Age of the
Church of God; and by which the Sufferings
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> are distinguish'd from
the Sufferings of all that ever went before
them.</P>
<P>And what Reproach must the Practice of these
Times leave upon the Episcopal Party now alive
in <HI>Scotland;</HI> many of whom were real Actors in
the Cruellest Part of this Tragedy! Nay, saving
that the Author of this would not by naming of
Names, load the Heads of some who are at the
Writing of this, under the just Prosecution of
the Government for Treason and Real Rebellion.
He could single out the Persons of some that are
now in the Hands of Justice; who were among
the most Bloody and Raging Persecutors of those
Times: But omitting their Names, however
just the Reflection, he cannot but lead them by
the Hand to this just Observation, <HI>viz.</HI> How
Righteous is that Providence, which causes them
to lye at the Feet of a Provok'd Sovereign,
Crying for Mercy, <HI>AND TO BE DENYED;</HI>
who Denyed Mercy to so many of their Inno∣cent
<PB N="212" REF="311"/>
Neighbours and Fellow-Creatures; who
were Guilty neither of Treason or Rebellion;
but only of Worshipping the Great Creator of
all Things according to His Command; and in
such a Manner as the Authority of Conscience
made their indispensible Duty.</P>
<P>But to return to the Facts: Prosecutions in
Forms of Justice, <HI>as I said,</HI> seem'd now at an
End; the Methods of drawing Blood seem'd to
be exhausted, tho' the Thirst of Blood was not
quench'd. The Number of Prisoners to be
dragg'd to Execution, or Informers to accuse
particular Persons either were few, or too few,
to satisfie the voracious Appetite of the Perse∣cuting
Party: Nor was it particular Persons, but
the whole Body of Christians in the Denomina∣tion
of <HI>Whiggs,</HI> whose Blood they resolv'd to
shed.</P>
<P>Being therefore unsatisfy'd with the personal
Guilt of such who had been at <HI>Bothwell-Bridge;</HI>
or such as could be found at Field-Meetings.
whose Number, <HI>tho' daily great,</HI> were but few,
when compar'd with what they resolv'd to fall
upon. They proceeded now to sum up their
Profession into Generals; to form them into
Principles; and then make those Principles
Criminal: By which Method they knew, they
should infallibly involve the whole Body of those
People in such Circumstances, as would entitle
the Government to a Right to put them to
Death. The Case was thus.</P>
<Q><P>1. They knew, That these persecuted People
esteem'd themselves engaged by the <HI>Na∣tional
Covenant</HI> in the Solemnest Bond ima∣ginable:
That it was the Oath of God;
that no human Power could dissolve the
<PB N="213" REF="312"/>
Obligation: And that the breaking it as
it had been broken, was no less a Crime
than a National Perjury.</P>
<P>2. They look'd upon the King as an Enemy and
Persecutor of God's People; as a Prince per∣jur'd,
by his Breaking and Renouncing the
Covenant; and guilty of involving the whole
Nation in the same Detestable Crime of
Perjury: Also they look'd upon him as
a Persecutor of God's Church, and a
Bloody Destroyer of his People. And for
these Reasons they could not satisfy them∣selves
to pray for him, or say to him, God
speed.</P>
<P>3. As for the Killing the Arch-Bishop of St.
<HI>Andrew</HI>'s, they did not esteem it a Mur∣ther,
or an Assassination; but esteeming
themselves to be in Open War with him,
and with all the Members of that Bloody
Society call'd, <HI>The Council of Scotland;</HI> who
had treated them and their Brethren with
Barbarity as Enemies to Mankind; and had
by all Kinds of Cruelty and Inhumanity
<HI>without Law; except such as their Lust of
Blood form'd into Acts of Council, and contrary
to the Constitution had call'd Laws; and to
which they gave the Force of Laws;</HI> put their
Brethren unjustly to Death; which they
esteem'd Murther of the vilest Sort, e∣steeming
these Men, I say, by their Bloody
Doings to be Blood-Suckers, Murtherers,
and open declared Enemies to God and
Man: They thought it just, <HI>as in Time
of War,</HI> to persue them to Death in what
Manner they could, and wherever they
<PB N="214" REF="313"/>
could, and wherever they might be
found.</P>
<P>4. As to the Taking Arms at <HI>Pentland</HI> and at
<HI>Bothwell,</HI> and other Places; they would by
no Means admit it to be Rebellion: Be∣cause
Nature dictating Self-Defence to all
Creatures to whom it has given a Life to
defend. And they being attack'd by the
Arm'd Troops of their Persecutors, while
they innocently and peaceably performed
their undoubted and indispensible Duty,
<HI>viz.</HI> the Worshipping God according to his
own Institution; they thought themselves
bound by the Laws of Nature, and al∣lowed
by the Laws of God to defend their
Lives, and the Lives of their Wives and
<HI>Children.</HI></P></Q>
<P>As the poor People maintain'd these Prin∣ciples
with the greatest Exactness; and per∣sisted
to do so with the greatest Constancy:
So their Persecutors knew well what Use to
make of this Steady Adherence to their Prin∣ciples;
and how to make it a Handle to them
to take Hold of the otherwise most innocent
and inoffensive part of the People, and drag
them to immediate Execution without further
Process. And this Device they question'd not
would serve them to destroy and extirpate the
whole Body of the People, as they owned was
their Design.</P>
<P>To this Wicked and Barbarous Purpose they
fram'd 4 Questions upon the Heads above-men∣tioned;
which they resolv'd to have offer'd to
the persecuted People upon all Occasions; and
to which they should oblige the said People to
<PB N="215" REF="314"/>
give an immediate direct Answer: On refusing
which Answer, or not answering to their Minds,
they were immediately to be put to Death.
And here is to be noted, that <HI>as it was said,</HI> the
late Arch-Bis;hop of St. <HI>Andrew</HI>'s, Gen. <HI>Dalziel,</HI>
and several others of the fiercest of the perse∣cuting
Council had often complain'd, That the
Formalities of the Law, that is to say, bringing
Men to the Bar, and to be Try'd by Judges,
Juries, Hearings, Pleadings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were Obstruc∣tions
to the King's Service: So the present
Council proceeding by the same Rules of Cruelty,
resolv'd to make shorter Work with them; and
therefore, that the Forms of Process, bringing
to Prisons, and to Tryals, might not delay, or
encumber the Execution, and prevent the dis∣patching
the innocent Victim fast enough. They
decreed, That every private Soldier, <HI>an Army
of whom they had now Quarter'd upon the persecuted
People,</HI> should have Power to tender the said
Questions to every Man they met, or to whom
they pleased; and upon refusing to answer, the
said Soldier was empowered, to kill them upon
the Spot; and lest I may be thought to do this
General <HI>Dalziel</HI> an Injury, and record of him
any Thing which was not suitable to the rest of
his Practice; who, if Fame belies him not, was
a Man as void of Humanity, as most that ever
Heaven permitted to live. I say, that I may
not wrong him, I shall give the following brief
Account of an Action of his, or a Specimen of
his compassionate Temper; by which the Cha∣racter
of the Man may be guest at without
Breach of Charity. It was soon after the Rising
at <HI>Pentland,</HI> when he had been sent into the
Shire of <HI>Air,</HI> to make Search for, and put to
Death such of the poor People as he could find
<PB N="216" REF="315"/>
were in the said Rising. He sends a Lieutenant
with a Party of Men to <HI>New-Mills,</HI> and order'd
them to seize and bring to him an honest poor
Man, whose Name was <HI>Finlay,</HI> and who was
peaceably living in his own House, nor had he
been at all in Arms: When his Men brought
the Prisoner to him he examin'd him private∣ly,
<HI>no Witness being by;</HI> and with a kind or Ci∣vility,
unusual to him, whether he had been at
<HI>Lanerck</HI> with the Rebels? The Man answer'd,
He was at <HI>Lanerck</HI> upon his private Business
when their Army came thither; and told him
what his Business was, offering to prove the
Truth of it; and declared, That he was not in
Arms, or had any Weapon with him: Nei∣ther
did he go among them: Then he ask'd
him if he remembred any of those he saw a∣mong
them, and who they were? The Man
declar'd he did not; whereupon he calls for
the Lieutenant, and order'd him to carry that
Man to the Gallows, and have him shot to
Death: For that he had confest he was with
the Rebels. The poor Man being brought to
the Place in a great Hurry and Surprize asks
the Lieutenant, if the General was in Earnest;
the Lieutenant said he feared he was: How∣ever
being a Civil Man, and loth to Execute
such a Cruel Commission, and the poor Man
protesting his Innocency, and entreating him as
a Christian, that at least he might have a Re∣prieve
for that Night, that he might prepare
for Death and Eternity. The Lieutenant, I say,
upon this goes back to the General, and laying
before him the poor Man's Case, entreated him
to grant him a few Hours Time no prepare for
Death: But the General flying out in a Rage
at the Lieutenant, and with Horrid Oaths and
<PB N="217" REF="316"/>
Blasphemies commands him to return, and tells
him he would teach him to obey his Orders after
a better Manner, than to come back and make
himself an Advocate for Rebels: Upon this,
the Lieutenant went back directly to the Man,
and immediately shot him dead upon the Spot.</P>
<P>This and such as this was their Temper at
that Time; And I think I may say they were
now come to the Height of their Fury. The
Measure of their Cruelty fill'd up a-pace; all the
<HI>French</HI> Dragooning, the Popish Burnings, the
Heathen Torturings that we read of in the
World, scarce ever came up to this. In all
those cases, the Sufferers were brought before
Judges and Magistrates, Officers of Justice, and
Men in Power. But such was the Thirst of
I Blood here, that they appeared willing to strip
themselves of their Magisterial Authority, and
make every private Sentinel, every Musquetier,
both Judge, Jury, and Executioner.</P>
<P>Never was Justice Executed in such a sum∣mary
Way as on this Occasion: For, now the
Soldiers fill'd the Streets and High-Ways with
Blood: Men, Women, nay, and little Children
were dragg'd out of their Houses, from their
Shops, Trades and Labour to immediate Death,
without Warning, without Pity, and without
Time given them to call upon God for Mercy
to their Souls.</P>
<P>Nor was the Life of the most Innocent Person
safe at this Time from the Rapine of the Sol∣diers:
For now, it was the easiest Thing in
the World for private Revenge to be pursued to
Blood; and it was in the Power of the Sol∣diers
to execute the greatest Villany with Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>punity:
They had no more to do but to
Rob, Ravish, Insult, Plunder, and commit what
<PB N="218" REF="317"/>
Wickedness they pleased, and adding Murther
to the rest, say, the Person Murther'd, refused
to answer the Questions.</P>
<P>These Questions model'd according to the
Heads before recited, were thus,</P>
<P>1. Will you renounce the Covenant?</P>
<P>2. Will you Pray for the King, or will you
say God bless the King?</P>
<P>3. Was the Killing the Archbishop of St. <HI>An∣drews</HI>
Murther, yea or no?</P>
<P>4. Was the rising at <HI>Bothwel Brigg</HI> Rebellion,
yea or no?</P>
<P>It should have been observ'd before this, that
in order effectually to suppress these persecuted
People, and to finish the ruin of the Country,
the Government had raised what the Country
People call'd the <HI>Highland Host.</HI> The Account
the Persecutors gave of this was, “That the
' <HI>Loyal Clans</HI> offered their Service to his Majesty,
to bring into the Field a body of Men, from
among their Vassals and Servants, compleatly
arm'd, who were to march whether his Maje∣sty
should please to command them, for the
suppressing of the Rebellion, and for pre∣venting
the Rebels and Whigs from gathering
in Troops, in the Western Shires.”</P>
<P>On these pretence's, those <HI>Highlanders,</HI> little
better than Barbarians, and in some Cases much
worse, were arm'd and taken into the Service
of <HI>Satan,</HI> and some time after the <HI>Bothwel Brigg</HI>
affair, were order'd to the Number of 8000
Men to Quarter upon the suffering People, in
the Shires of <HI>Air, Galloway,</HI> and other the We∣stern
Shires: There they exercis'd all the Ra∣pine,
Violence, Robbery and Wickedness, over
and above the Murther, and shedding of innocent
<PB N="219" REF="318"/>
Blood, of which we are just going to speak, that
may be expected from an ungovern'd Souldiery,
or that could be practised upon, or suffered by a
People, given up to the lust and rage of a crew
of Savages.</P>
<P>In this posture stood the publick Affairs as to
the Persecutors, yet their rage receiv'd no a∣batement;
the very thought of the Spirit, and
undepress'd courage of the Persecuted, gall'd and
exasperated them: To see a set of Men living
like wild Creatures in the Mountains, and yet
there in spite of human Power, freely preser∣ved
the Liberty of their Principles, and met
publickly and frequently in mighty Numbers,
for the worship of God; and that it was impos∣sible
for them, either to apprehend or prevent
them; this provok'd them to the last Degree:
They found now, that as these wandring Out∣law'd
People must be, and indeed so they really
were harbour'd and reliev'd at the greatest Peril
by the People in the plain Country, the only
way left to extirpate them more effectually, was
to ruin and impoverish the whole Country, that
the banish'd proscrib'd Refugees, might have
no relief from them; and to make it punishable
in the highest manner, and as the most capital
Crime for any so much as to talk with, much
less entertain, comfort, relieve and support one
of those, who, <HI>as they call it,</HI> were intercom<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>un'd;
and this was so severely put in Execution,
that we find among their lists of their Butchery's
by the Hangman; one <HI>Ramsey</HI> executed only
for going over a River in a Ferry Boat, with one
who had been a Rebel, and talking with him in
common, as with other Men in the Boat.</P>
<P>But all these cruelties were not yet able to ex∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>irpate
a race of Men, By whose Sufferings
<PB N="220" REF="319"/>
the Grace and Mercy of God, was to be made
so conspicuous in the World: NAY so far
was it from than, that on the other hand, the
Numbers of them daily encreased, even under
their very Persecutions, as was the Case in the
Primitive times of the Church, their Field
Meetings grew more frequented, and were
more publickly held, and that with such Mul∣titudes
as were scarce credible to relate.</P>
<P>Nor were the zealous persecuted People pre∣vailed
upon, to abate one Tittle of the Testi∣mony,
which they thought themselves oblig'd
to bear against the Wickedness of their Ene∣mies,
and that particularly in two Points.</P>
<P>1. Their National Perjury in breaking their
Oath to God, and to his People; (<HI>viz.</HI>) in break<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
and renouncing the Covenant.</P>
<P>2. Their erecting an Episcopal Church, Go∣vernment
which they abhorr'd, and which these
treated with no other Name than an Anti-christian
Prelacy.</P>
<Q><HI>Note,</HI> They justified the Term Anti-christian,
for the Prelatick Hierarchy owning the Su∣premacy
of the King over the Church,
whereas they allowed Christ Jesus to be the
only Head and King of the Church on
Earth.</Q>
<P>On the other Hand those two Articles, and
especially the open and daring Profession
O<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, by these persecuted People, was un∣sufferable,
and to the last Degree provo∣king
to their Persecutors; and the more in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
they could neither by all their Cruelties, and
most inhuman Usage, deter either those that
<PB N="221" REF="320"/>
dyed to abate their open Detestation of these
two Things, at their Execution, or those that
remained to refrain their open Profession of the
same abhorrences, no not for fear of the same
Tortures.</P>
<P>Nor could they by all their bloody prosecuti∣ons
prevent the Field Meetings they so much
exclaimed against, where the resolution of the
persecuted People, to persevere to their Death,
in their opposition to the Prelates, and their ad∣hering
to the Covenant, was always expres'd
in such Terms, and the People were so con∣firm'd
in those resolutions, that the Council
saw too plainly nothing but Death could put an
End to it; and the whole race of suffering Chri∣stians
must be destroy'd and extirpated, or they
should never Conquer the Opposition they made
to the Planting of Episcopacy in that Kingdom,
and upon this resolution they proceeded.</P>
<P>In the mean time the Poor People, as if the
heat of the Persecution had but served to in∣fluence
their Zeal, thought themselves oblig'd
to declare a War, tho' of a different Nature a∣gainst
their Persecutors; and to let them see,
that upon a just and equal Principle, they could
clear themselves of the Guilt charg'd upon
them, of being Rebels against Lawful Autho∣rity;
and to this end at one of their publick and
most numerous Meetings in the West, they o∣penly
declar'd themselves revolted fvoin the
Government, ' renounced, and disown'd all
Allegiance, Obedience, Homage or Duty to
the King and his Administration; as being an
Enemy to God and to the Church of God, and
therefore not legally constituted, or to be ac∣knowledg'd
as their Supream Lord. But <HI>Ipso
Jure</HI> deposed, from all Regal Authortiy over
<PB N="222" REF="321"/>
them, and divested of the Office of a Magi∣strate,
and of the Trust or Charge of Govern∣ment
which was reposed in and devolved
upon him, by express Compact, at his Coro∣nation,
when he solemnly entred into an Oath
and Covenant, with God and his People;
and which Oath, Covenant and Compact he
had violated, breaking all the Conditions, and
impiously renouncing the Obligation thereof,
upon which Oath and the Obligation thereof,
all his regal Authority and their Allegiance,
were entirely founded; and upon the Breach
whereof, their subjection which was limited
to the provisions of those Compacts and Co∣venants
was explicitly disengaged and remit∣ted.”</P>
<P>This was 'tis true a bold step, and many of
their Brethren seem'd to censure them upon
such a desperate proceeding, but it seems they
were only such who had Accepted the Li∣berty
mentioned before upon the Terms of
License from the Prelates which tempo∣rising
and cowardly Complyance, these zea∣lous
People abhorr'd as Sinful, and condemn'd
as a fainting in Gods Cause, giving over their
Constancy, and above all, as a wicked recogni∣tion
of that Episcopal Authority, from which
they receiv'd such License; This they call'd
Homologating the Legality of what they
themselves Condemn'd as Anti-scripturial
and Anti-christian, and which they were engaged i<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
the solemnest manner by the Covenant, never <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
permit, much less submit to in the Nation.</P>
<P>The Censure of such therefore was of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
Value to them, and they insisted upon <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
right they had to declare, their revolt fro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
their Allegiance to King <HI>Cha.</HI> II. as their natur∣al
<PB N="223" REF="322"/>
Privilege, and as the just consequence of
his Breach of the Compact of Government.</P>
<P>The noise the Council made of this Declara∣tion,
was strange indeed, how they declared
these People Rebels, Mad, Enrag'd, <HI>Scelerates,
&amp;c.</HI> People to be abhorr'd by Christians, and
to be rooted out from the general Society of
Mankind, <HI>and the like;</HI> and seem'd to justify all
the inhumanities they at that time resolv'd to
practice upon them, and to Legitimate all their
Extra-judicial Measures, by the clamour they
raised upon them, for this one Action; not fore-seeing
that in a few Years those same Men
should do the same thing, with the next King of
the same Race, and call for a Regiment of those
same honest persecuted Sufferers, whom they
had thus damn'd for Rebels and Parricides, to
guard them in the doing it, <HI>as was within the
space of 12 Years, the very Case,</HI> as I shall shew in
its order.</P>
<P>In this solemn revolt, or renouncing their Al∣legiance,
they repeated the several Acts of Vi∣olence
and Oppression, which had been practised
or authoriz'd by the King, and by his wicked
Counsellors, whereby he unhinged all the legal
Establishment of their Religion, and subverted all
their Religious Liberties: The Kings Supremacy,
they call'd a Blasphemous and Sacrilegious; Usur∣pation
being an illegal Anti-scripturial Dominion
over the Institution of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and the Ordi∣nances
of his own Divine Appointment.</P>
<P>They proceed to declare, that tlie King had
overturn'd all the Fundamental part of the
Civil Constitution, subverting the Laws and
Liberties of the People, destroying their Civil
and Natural Rights, and all the Securities of
Life and Enjoyment whatsoever; and that all
<PB N="224" REF="323"/>
this was by claiming and assuming a right to an
Absolute, Tyrannical Arbitrary Government,
by his pretended Prerogative, independent of
Law, and superior thereto; all which they de∣clare
to be illegal and inconsistent with the
Safety, Freedom, and legal Privileges of the
People, and with the Oath and Obligation of a
King.</P>
<P>These and many other things they gave, as
the reason of their revolt from, and renouncing
Allegiance to the King, which I am the more
particular in, because of their affinity to, and
the sanction they soon after receiv'd from the ge∣neral
Practise of the whole Island, and also to add
this remark, <HI>viz.</HI> How these poor People were
not only handled by their Enemies, but even
censur'd by their Friends, for owning those very
Principles at that time, upon which the Safety
of the whose Nation was found in a few Years
to depend; and for professing such Opinions, as
in so little a while were judged essential to the
publick Safety, and on which to this Day, our
<HI>Protestant</HI> Constitution is founded <HI>viz.</HI> That Ty∣rants
and Arbitrary persecuting Princes may be
Renounc'd, the People may revolt from their
Allegiance to them, depose them from their u∣surp'd
Authority, and yet cannot be justly call'd
Rebels and Traytors: <HI>Witness the Revolution and</HI>
Protestant <HI>Succession.</HI></P>
<P>But asking Pardon for this needful Digression,
I return to the suffering People, who however
righteous the Principles were which they acted
from were, yet for some Years to Drink the Dregs
of <HI>Popish</HI> and Tyrannical Persecution, to the full
Tryal of their Faith and Patience. For Example,</P>
<P>After they had thus declar'd their revolt
from, and renounced their Allegiance to the
<PB N="225" REF="324"/>
King, and his Instruments of Tyranny, they
proceeded in a solemn manner to pronounce the
greater Excommunication, in which they Ex∣communicated
the King, and the Bishops, a∣mong
the Enemies and Contemners of God and
his Church. They likewise in the same Decla∣ration
protested against a <HI>Popish</HI> Successor; and
declar'd that they would never receive the Duke
of <HI>York</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> nor admit him to possess the
Crown.</P>
<P>Thus I have given the Reader an abridg'd
Relation of what was done on their part. But
what Tongue can express, or Pen describe the
Usage these poor People received, and the Cru∣elties
they suffer'd on this Account. “Not only
Time, <HI>says a solid Writer of that Day,</HI> but
Heart and Tongue would fail any Christian
to relate all the Violences, Murthers, Plun∣derings,
Extortions, and Insolencies, that from
the beginning of this Persecution have been
committed in a military way, besides what
has been done in the form and course of pub∣lick
pretended Justice: IF stabbing, wounding,
beating, stripping, and imprisoning Mens
persons: IF violent breaking into their Hou∣ses
in the dead of the Night; beating, woun∣ding,
ravishing, and inhumanely abusing Wives
and Daughters. IF forcing weak Women by
Tortures, such as burning Matches, and other
unsufferable Torments to discover, nay accuse
their Husbands, Fathers, and dearest Relations.
IF driving away their Cattle, spoiling their
Goods without respect to Guilt or Innocence;
and this in as cruel a manner as ever <HI>Scotland</HI>
had seen, or could have seen, had a foreign
Army been in the bowels of their Country.
IF all these, and many more such may express
<PB N="226" REF="325"/>
our Misery, <HI>says this Author,</HI> some Guess may
be made at the Sufferings of this Church from
the Malice and Fury of this wicked prevail∣ing
Prelatick party.”</P>
<P>But we now come to the methods taken with
those persons who they could by no other
means lay hold upon. These consisted of two
sorts, (1.) Those who having been in Arms,
and had escaped the Sword of Battle, were fled
to the Mountains: Or, (2.) those who having
been mark'd out for Destruction by their Perse∣cutors
were withdrawn to the other: Those
Men holding fast their Integrity, and having
many Ministers among them, kept up their
Field-preachings, and enjoy'd the Free∣dom
of their Religious Exercises, notwith∣standing
the most inveterate Rage of their Ene∣mies;
and this, as I said already, provok'd the
Persecutors to such a Degree that they were not
able to contain themselves, but would flye at the
Innocent to punish the Guilty, that is to say, who
they suppos'd guilty,for other Guilt they had none.</P>
<P>To punish them then as far as they were able,
seeing they could do it no other way; <HI>First,</HI> they
intercommuned them, as they call it, forbid∣ding
any Person to harbour, hide, comfort, or
correspond with any of them; or even so much
as to salute, or talk with them on the way, on
pain of Treason and Rebellion; and of being pro∣secuted
for the same Crimes which those they so
harbour'd, comforted, or corresponded with
were charg'd with.</P>
<P>In the next place to disappoint them who were
wandring about in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins,
in Dens, and Holes, and Caves of the Earth; and
effectually to prevent their being reliev'd sup∣ported
from their Friends, Relations, or other∣wise;
<PB N="227" REF="326"/>
they found it absolutely necessary by
Troops of Soldiers who were subsisted by the poor
Sufferers, to ruin and impoverish the Country by
their various Plunderings and Depredations, ra∣ther
like Troops in an Enemy's Country, than
Troops Billited and placed under Discipline.</P>
<P>This was the Case when Justice was transferr'd
from the Judges on the Bench to the Soldier in the
Field; and this not to the Officers, to the Court
Martial, or Assembly of Officers, or Generals; but
to the brutal common Soldiers, who neither had
Conscience to judge by, Reason to judge from,
Sense to guide, Humanity to spare, or Temper to
consider who to kill, and who to save.</P>
<P>It would be endless to turn this Account into
a <HI>Scots</HI> Martyrology, or a Register of Barbarities.
These Sheets are no way equal to a History of
such a length; but keeping myself to the Brevity
of Memoirs. <HI>Agreeable to my Title,</HI> I shall give
some Specimens of the bloody management of
this part of the Work; I mean as to this new
fashioned way of Persecution, by delivering a
naked defenceless People up to the Fury of the
common Soldiers; and some flagrant Instances
of this kind will be sufficient to describe the rest.</P>
<P>The first I meet with is the Story of a poor
Woman and a young Maiden of about 16 Years
old in the West of <HI>Scotland,</HI> who were cruelly mur∣thered
by some Men belonging to <HI>Grierson</HI> of <HI>Log,</HI>
an Eminent Persecutor in that part of the Coun∣try.
They began by putting the Questions to
them abovemention'd; and the first they offered,
<HI>as what was most popular at that Time in the World,
and best serv'd, as they thought, to expose the persc∣cuted
People to the Court,</HI> was that of, <HI>Will ye say
God bless the King.</HI> As I have receiv'd this Story
from Creditable Witnesses, take it as follows;
<PB N="228" REF="327"/>
The Woman told them she would pray to God
to forgive the King his Sins: The Maid said
she would pray that God would please to give
the King Repentance: But <HI>it would be an impious
Thing,</HI> said the Woman, <HI>to pray to God to save,</HI>
that is, <HI>to bless a Covenant-breaking perjur'd Magi∣strate,</HI>
and in the Prosecution of his Perjury too:
And they both declar'd it was against their Con∣sciences,
their Principles, and the Covenant;
and that therefore <HI>they could not do it.</HI> The Wo∣man
said boldly, That while the King was <HI>a Per∣secutor
of God's People</HI> he was an Enemy to <HI>GOD</HI>
and to the Church of <HI>GOD;</HI> and she thought it
was an abominable Thing to ask of any Christian
to pray for Prosperity <HI>to the Persecutors of the Church
of Christ;</HI> for that was to say <HI>God speed to them,</HI>
Even in the very Persecution itself: She was an
undaunted Woman, and challeng'd them to an∣swer
her in that particular; but they had no∣thing
to say to her Argument, but thought she
would have some Regard to theirs which was,
<HI>Pray to God to bless the King—or dye. Will ye
kill me,</HI> says the Woman, <HI>because I will not bless
those who God curses! the Lord forbid that I should do
it, tho' I were to dye a Thousand Times.</HI> Upon this
they fix'd a Stake in the Sea at the low Water
Mark, and binding the poor Woman and the
young Girl to the Stake, let them stand there
'till the Tide flowed over them and drowned
them both, being also tormented almost to Death
with the Cold by standing in the Water so long
as 'till the Tide was high enough to drown them.
However, they both endur'd it with great Con∣stancy,
and withour the least Offer of Compliance
with the barbarous Adversary.</P>
<P>It has been matter of Censure among some, and
even of those otherwise in the same Interest, and
<PB N="229" REF="328"/>
of the same doctrinal Principles with those Peo∣ple;
when they found that they were so severely
nice in this particular of praying for the King;
seeing they are bid <HI>to pray for Kings and all in Au∣thority.</HI>
But not to make these Memoirs enter
into long Disputes of the Points between them
and their Persecutors, which is not the work of
a Historian. I shall only state and remove the
Question in few Words from these poor Sufferers
to their Enemies, and leave them to answer it if
they know how.</P>
<P>In the first place, it is true they began with these
poor Women upon that Question of praying for
the King, which was a piece of wicked Policy on
their parts; because it was the most popular Que∣stion,
and by which they thought they made
these People odious to the King, and represented
them as his particular Enemies; and persuaded
him by it to let them go on with their Persecu∣tion,
which <HI>by the way</HI> they had much ado to pre∣vail
in; for the King who was in himself of a
merciful Disposition, being often shock'd with the
Accounts of their Cruelties and often saying o∣penly
he would have no more Blood shed. <HI>I say,</HI>
this was a wicked Policy on their Part; for
'tis known they had Three or Hour Que∣stions
more in their Orders; any of which
were of such a Nature, as that the poor Peo∣ple
would have suffred Death rather than to
have comply'd: for Example, had these Two
poor Women answer'd, <HI>Yes, we will say God save
the King;</HI> the next Question had been, <HI>Will ye
renounce the Covenant?</HI> a Question, which if it
were now ask'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> I believe there are
50000 People would as soon renounce the very
Name of Christians; <HI>that is to say,</HI> they would
suffer all that humane Nature could suffer rather
<PB N="230" REF="329"/>
than do it. So that upon the whole, these People
did not suffer for a single Opposition of the King's
Lawful Authority as was wickedly charg'd on
them; but they were given up to Death by a
Party, and they singl'd out such points to question
them upon as they knew they could not comply
with, that they might destroy them; and if these
Questions would not have done it, they would
have named others for the Purpose.</P>
<P>Farther, it is evident that they refused pray∣ing
for the King upon a Religious Principle, not
upon a Rebellious Principle; and that as they
believed the King, <HI>as before,</HI> to be an Idolater,
a Persecutor; and an Enemy to God and his
People. They believ'd that for them to pray
for God to bless him would be either to mock
God by seeming to pray for what they did not
mean, or really to pray to God to bless the King,
even in his persecuting God's People, which
would be impious, and was against their Con∣sciences.</P>
<P>As to the other part which <HI>the Objectors alledge,
viz.</HI> it was a Trifle, and a Thing so small as that
they could not answer to lose their Lives for it;
we answer that then much less could those Cruel
and Inhumane Persecutors answer to take the
Lives of poor innocent Women and Children a∣way
for so small a Thing, which in the common
Judgment, and by their own Confession, was but
a Trifle in its Nature.</P>
<P>Likewise if it was against the Consciences and
Principles of the poor People, <HI>tho' we were to suppose
them misinform'd</HI> or uninform'd; yet they dyed in a
Righteous Cause, not as they dyed for refusing to
pray for the King; but as they chose to dye rather
than to violate their Obedience to the Sovereign∣ty
of Conscience, which is a Principle every
Christian ought to adhere <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o.</P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="330"/>
Let these things serve for Answers <HI>'till they can
be</HI> consuted, to the Persecutors themselves, and to
all those who would blacken the Memory of these
Conscientious and Zealous People, pretending
they were Obstinate, that they threw away their
Lives, and that they dyed upon Foundations and
Principles which are not to be justified; it is
evident they were right in their adhering sted∣fastly
to the known Duty of a Christian, <HI>viz. of
suffering the greatest Evil rather than committing the
leas Sin.</HI> Nay, tho' they were to have it granted,
that they were, <HI>as I said above,</HI> misinform'd in
the Nature of the Thing they suffer'd for: It
might be observed here, that it was the very
Argument used with many of the primitive
Martyrs in the Time of the Ten Persecutions:
That it was a small Thing but to take a Censor
in their Hands, <HI>to seem as if</HI> they did sacrifice,
<HI>tho' they did not;</HI> That the Prayer to the Gods
was made by the Priests, and it was a Thing of
no Consequence to bow the Head, which they
might do as to <HI>Caesar,</HI> and not as to the Gods
above; Thus also in the Case of the Martyr'd
<HI>Maccabees,</HI> their Persecutors pretended in Clemen∣cy
to offer them their Lives, if they would but
take a bit of Swine's Flesh into their Mouths,
tho' they did not swallow it down. But with
what Abhorrence did they <HI>REFƲSE!</HI> with what
joy and Alacrity did they dye! mean the pri∣mitive
Christians as well as the <HI>Maccabees:</HI> Inso∣much
that the wisest of the Heathen condemn'd
them as Fools; for that they cast themselves
away, and lost their Lives, not for the Essential
parts of Religion, but for Trifles and Circum∣stances
of no Consequence.</P>
<P>I might insist here upon the evident Testi∣mony,
that God was pleased to give even from
<PB N="232" REF="331"/>
Heaven to these suffering People; that the of∣fering
up their Lives in this Case was an accep∣table
Sacrifice to Him, and a reasonable Service
in them: And this Testimony was by an almost
universal Assistance given them in their Suffer∣ings,
filling them with abundant Strength to un∣dergo,
Patience to bear, and Comfort, even to
Joy and Tryumph under the severest and cruel∣lest
Torments that their most inhumane Perse∣cutors
could inflict. I take this from an Author
who was an Eye-Witness of, and a Fellow-Suf∣ferer
in much of it; and therefore give the fol∣lowing
Account in his own Words, and from his
own Observation, <HI>as follows<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>“We shall not, indeed cannot, enter upon the
particular Declaration of that Grace, Con∣stancy,
and Courage, by which the Lord's
faithful Witnesses were-sustain'd, and by which
they did bear Testimony to the Word of His
Truth: Only this is certain, that many of
them, tho' illiterate and obscure Men, and that
when they came to the Scaffold they were hur∣ry'd
and interrupted by the Order of the Pre∣lates
and Council, and by the Cruelty and In∣humanity
of the Executioners and Officers at∣tending;
yet they did bear Witness to the
Cause of God, and of that Grace and Assurance
whereby the Lord upheld them to the Admi∣ration
and Astonishment of all the Beholders.”</P>
<P>“That at <HI>Glasgow and Air,</HI> where Eleven of
them were Executed, all mean Countrymen;
some very ancient, some not above 17 Years
old; and that their Enemies caused Drums to
be beat round the Scaffold, that they might
not be heard; yet were they so little thereby
amaz'd, or disorder'd, that as well by Words
of Praise and Thanksgiving to God, when they
<PB N="233" REF="332"/>
might be heard; and by their Countenances, Ge∣stures,
and other Carriage they did bear such
Testimony to the Truth, as that thereby many
were confirm'd, and their Enemies were made
asham'd.”</P>
<P>“Likewise tho' some at other Times did ap∣pear
weak and faint-hearted at first, yet so
powerfully and abundantly was it given to
them <HI>in that Hour,</HI> that out of Weakness they
were made strong; and declar'd often, that
they had such Discoveries of God's Glory be∣tween
the Prison and the Gibbet, that all
fear was thereby discussed: And particularly
a poor Country Boy, who they Condemn'd at
<HI>Air</HI> for refusing the Declaration, which they
told him was a Renouncing the Covenant that
he had taken at <HI>Lanerck.</HI> This Child thro'
Fear, and particularly Ignorance of the Grounds
Of Christianity, was in great Agonies upon his
Soul's Account, greatly fearing to dye, yet not
daring to redeem his Life on the Terms offer'd.
But after the Prayers and Conference of some
good People that had Access to him at <HI>Irwin</HI>
two Days before he dy'd, he appear'd so much
changed, that on the Morning of has Execution
instead of the Depth of Fear and Perplexity,
the obtained a full Resolution and Joy so
much inlightned with the Knowledge of God
in and thro' our Lord Jesus Christ, and with
the Hope of Salvation thro' His Name; that all
that law him, do bear Teftimony to the Grace
and wonderful Work of God in his Heart;
whereby he went to the Scaffold with Joy,
leaping and praising God.”</P>
<P>“From all which, and the several Testimonies
and Speeches which these left behind them in
Writing, we conclude and rejoyce, that God
<PB N="234" REF="333"/>
out of the dark Cloud of such a sad and asto∣nishing
Providence which has now overspread
us, hath brought forth so blessed and so bright
a Cloud of Witnesses, strengthened and fill'd
with so much Grace and Glory to bear Testi∣mony
to His Name <HI>Covenant</HI> and Cause for
the Confirmation of all that love and wait for
His Salvation.”</P>
<P>A further Testimony of this will be seen in the
Speeches of some of the Sufferers at the place of
Execution; of which in its Order.</P>
<P>But to return to our Memoirs of Fact, the first
Thing the <HI>Highland</HI> Forces were empowered to
do, was to press from all the People where they
had any Knowledge of their being <HI>Dissenters,</HI> or
of their having <HI>Dissenters</HI> in their Families, a
<HI>BOND of Conformity,</HI> as they call'd it; wherein
every Person entring into the said Bond was
bound, not only for himself, but all under him,
<HI>viz.</HI> Wife, Children and Servants, to frequent
and keep to his <HI>Parochial Kirk,</HI> or <HI>Parish-Church,</HI>
and never to go either to any House or Field-Meeting;
nor <HI>resett,</HI> that is, receive or entertain
any that did so, on any Pretence whatsoever; also
to inform against, and to deliver up if in their
power, all the Ministers or Preachers, that exer∣cised
the Office of a Minister or Preacher, in
any such Meeting or Assembly.</P>
<P>Many thro' Fear, complyed with these unrea∣sonable
Conditions; not being able to bear the
ruin of their Families, and the severity of a
Flight into the Mountains, in the Winter Sea∣son;
where they had no Comfort or Relief, but
struggled with the extremities of Cold, Hun∣ger
and Diseases, occasion'd by damp Places to
lodge in, want of Necessaries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But others
resolving to suffer every thing, that Nature was
<PB N="235" REF="334"/>
able to support, to preserve a good Conscience,
fled to the Mountains, where they had to their
Lot exactly what is described in the 11th of the
<HI>Hebrews,</HI> ver. 37, 38. <HI>They wandered about in
Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, being destitute, afflicted,
tormented; they wandered in Desarts, and in Moun∣tains,
and in Dens and Caves of the Earth.</HI> This
was their Portion, and by this means the Towns
were left uninhabited, the Villages desolate, the
Lands unlabour'd, <HI>i. e.</HI> uncultivated, and the
richest, most populous, and, in Proportion, the
fruitfullest Part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> became a kind of
Wilderness, and like a House without the In∣habitant.</P>
<P>By this Means however, and by the Rising at
<HI>Bothwell, mention'd before,</HI> the Number of those
Refugees in the Mountains encreased, and the
Meetings in the Fields for Publick Worship were
more frequent, which still exasperated the Per∣secutors;
and they, being enraged, omitted no
Cruelty, no Injustice, no Inhumanity, for the
Destruction of them: They very well knew that
the People lurking in the Mountains must of Ne∣cessity
receive Supplies of Food and Clothes,
either from their own Families and Friends
which were left behind, or of Charity from
others; and therefore as first they took care
effectually, by Plunder and Rapine, to leave
nothing in the Houses of those that were fled,
so they persecuted with the utmost Rigour all
that were but suspected of harbouring or re∣lieving them.</P>
<P>I shall begin with the Prisoners taken at <HI>Bothwell.</HI>
Mr. <HI>Kid</HI> and Mr. <HI>King,</HI> as has been said, and se∣veral
others, were executed as Traytors; and,
as if their Cruelty had been satisfy'd, it was re∣solv'd
in Council to Transport the rest into the
<PB N="236" REF="335"/>
<HI>English</HI> Plantations. Upon the King's Orders and
under Pretence of this Transportation, there were
300 of the said Prisoners put on hoard of a
Ship, in Order, as was said, to be sent to the
<HI>West-Indies.</HI> These are those of whom Men∣tion
is made already, Page 203. of whom this is
yet necessary to be said, That altho' they were
publickly allow'd Transportation, yet it is cer∣tain
nothing less than so much Favour was de∣sign'd
them. Some have said that it was then
publickly known that the Council had, <HI>notwith∣standing
the Order from</HI> England, determined the
Transported People for Death; and, indeed, it
seems more than probable, seeing (<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>efides what
is said before of their not having sufficient Store
of Provisions in the Ship for such a Voyage)
they sail'd Northward to go to the <HI>English</HI> Co∣lonies
in <HI>America</HI> directly from <HI>Scotland;</HI> which,
by the Constituted Law of those Countries, <HI>cal∣led
the Act of Navigation,</HI> could not be done,
neither would any of those Colonies have re∣ceived
them, but have seized upon and forfeited
the Ship and Goods that came with them; so
that it is certainly more than a Suspicion that
the poor People were design'd for Destruction.
The Case was thus, when these poor People, I
say, were put on board the Ship, and sail'd out
of the <HI>Firth</HI> of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> it was expected they
should have gone directly to <HI>England,</HI> as Ships
bound to the <HI>English</HI> Plantations were always
used to do, and as indeed they were obliged by
the Laws of <HI>England</HI> to do, <HI>as above;</HI> but, on the
contrary, they sail'd Northward to the Coast of
the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> where, by Stress of Weather, <HI>as was
pretended,</HI> the Ship was driven among the Rocks,
and broken in pieces. The Master and Sea∣men,
and the Persons, or Murtherers-rather,
<PB N="237" REF="336"/>
who had the Guard or Conducting of the Pri∣soners,
easily got on Shore, as has been said;
and, had they been permitted, all the Priso∣ners
might likewise have done the same; whereas
the Officer who had the Guard of the Prisoners,
<HI>with</HI> the Master <HI>of the Ship,</HI> having, on Pretence of
Securing them, lock'd them all down under the
Hatches, would not, upon the most earnest and
moving Entreaties of even the Seamen and
others; nor the Shrieks and Cries of the poor
dying People, suffer the Hatches to be opened,
or one of them to be let out.</P>
<P>It seems there was one Seaman who ventur'd
his Life on board, when the Ship was just
breaking to pieces, and, with an Axe cutting
his Way thro' the Side or Deck of the Vessel,
let about 50 out, who were every one saved, but
the rest all perished, as before.</P>
<P>The best Excuse that the Murtherers ever
gave for this, was, that they had strict Orders,
whatsoever Port they should go on Shore at,
not to let any of the Prisoners go out of the
Ship: But this was so trifling an Excuse that
none could be satisfy'd with it, for either <HI>they had</HI>
Orders, That tho' the Ship was stranded or split
they should not let the Prisoners out, or <HI>they had
not;</HI> if <HI>they had,</HI> it must be with an Intent in
those who gave those Orders to have them pe∣rish
in such Shipwreck, as it happen'd, and
would give a shrewd Suspicion that such a Ship∣wreck
was intended, especially considering how
it afterwards came to pass. If no such Orders <HI>were</HI>
expresly <HI>given,</HI> then were the Officers Murther∣ers;
for it could not be imagin'd that a general
Order not to let the Prisoners go out of the
Ship, had any other Meaning, than that he
should use all Means possible to prevent their
<PB N="238" REF="337"/>
Escape; but not that they should be drown'd, or
that they should be kept in the Ship when she
was sinking, any more than a <HI>Mittimus</HI> to a
Jaylor, wherein he is to have the Prisoner in
safe keeping within his Jayl, suppose of <HI>New∣gate,</HI>
or any other Prison) gives him Power, or
obliges him, if the Prison-house should be on
Fire, to suffer the Prisoners to be burnt to
Death, rather than open the Doors to let them
out.</P>
<P>It is therefore very reasonable to believe that
this wretched lnstrument, or Executioner, for
he could be no better, had his secret Instru∣ctions
from the bloody persecuting Council for
what was done; and that the Ship was knock'd
on the Head on purpose to drown, and cause to
perish, the Number of poor Sufferers who the
Clemency of the Sovereign had forbid to be put
Death in a Judicial way, and who yet the Ma∣lice
and Rage of the Persecutors would not suf∣fer
to live.</P>
<P>Moreover, it has been creditably reported,
that those who provided or furnished this Ves∣sel
out for her Voyage, acknowledg'd that she
was not Victualled at all an Proportion to so
long a Voyage, and so large a Number of Peo∣ple
as were on board; no, nor any thing like it;
nay, it has been said that there was not Provi∣sions
on board for the Prisoners,sufficient to keep
them alive 14 Days; which, if it is true, would
convince an Atheist in such Things, that the
Design in putting these poor People on board,
was not to Transport, but to Murther them.</P>
<P>Another Argument is still good also against
the Persecutors of that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> If they did
not approve of the Officers Murthering these
poor People, why were they not prosecuted and
<PB N="239" REF="338"/>
punished for so horrid and inhumane a Murther,
the like of which no Protestant Age or Country
can give the History of? But, on the contrary,
the Master or Skipper, the officer of the Guards,
and all the rest concern'd, had no Punishment,
no Reprimand, neither was any thing; done to
them, to let them or the World believe they
had not done them very good Service.</P>
<P>Thus perished 250 of these good People; I
call them so on this most justifiable Foundation,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) because that tho' they might have their
Lives and Liberties given them by the Sove∣reign,
upon Terms, which, in Conscience, they
could not comply with, they <HI>loved not their Lives,
to the Death,</HI> they <HI>refused to accept of Deliverance:</HI>
And I call it Murther, because, as it is well known
the King's express Orders were that <HI>they should
not be put to Death,</HI> but be Transported. The
suffering them thus to perish, when it was ap∣parent
their Lives might have been saved, was
not a Murther only in the Officers, but a pre∣meditated
malicious Murther in the Council,
who so far conniv'd at and approv'd it, as ne∣ver
to offer any Vindication of themselves from
it, or any Resentment against the guilty Persons;
for it is a Murther of the blackest and most hor∣rid
kind, and which, I think, as before, has not
its Parallel in any History.</P>
<P>It has been mentioned also, that there were
about 60 more of these Prisoners put on board
another Ship for Transportation, who, there
being no secret Design to murther them, were
suffer'd to go by the ordinary Method, and to
fail the usual Way (<HI>viz.</HI>) to <HI>England;</HI> where, as
it is already noted, some Difference happening
between the Master and Owner of the Ship,
so that the Ship did not pursue her Voyage,
<PB N="240" REF="339"/>
and the Prisoners having been made the Pro∣perty
of the Owner, not of the Master; the
said Master thereupon, (being also a well in∣clined
Person) open'd his Hatches, and let them
all go. I mention this again here on this Oc∣casion,
<HI>viz.</HI> that it was very observable, in their
Case, that the Government here took no No∣tice
of their Escape, nor did the King order
any Search after them, or give any Order to re∣take
them, if found: All which evidently
proves, that the Cruelties exercised upon these
Sufferers in <HI>Scotland,</HI> proceeded from the Malice
and Rage of their Persecutors there, and neither
by the Direction or with the Approbation of the
King himself; not that this Clemency, which
in the King, was rather an Accident to his Na∣ture
than a Virtue in his Government, can ex∣cuse
his permitting these cruel Persecutions,
which he had, doubtless, Power to prevent;
and therefore was, doubtless, guilty of the
Blood that was spilt on that Occasion; which,
tho' his Inclination led him not to delight in,
yet his Indolence in Government, and his Apo∣state
Principles, suffer'd him to permit. But tho'
it is no Excuse to him whose Duty it was to
have put a Stop to the Stream of innocent Blood
shed under his Authority, it was, on the other
hand, a convincing Evidence of the bloody Dis∣position
of his Ministry in <HI>Scotland,</HI> who, thirst∣ing
for an Occasion to extirpate the very Name
of a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Church out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> dip'd
their Hands in Blood in that most inhumane
and unnatural manner, till they made all the
West of <HI>Scotland</HI> a Wilderness and a Desola∣tion.</P>
<P>This was the Proceeding against the <HI>Bothwell.</HI>
Bridge Prisoners. We shall now see what
<PB N="241" REF="340"/>
Usage they met with who had not been any
way concern'd in it.</P>
<P>First, in their Pursuit of the supposed Par∣ties,
they established little Inquisitions; and, in∣deed,
they were very properly called so; for
they went round the Country in Circuits, where
they enquir'd not only who really and actually
were in the Rebellion, but who were suspected
or believed to be so; and these they took Lists of,
make their Return upon; and after this they
summon'd them to appear before them, to clear
themselves.</P>
<Q><P>If they did not appear, they reputed them
Guilty, and declared them to be Rebels
Convict.</P>
<P>If they did appear, they were examin'd why
they did not go to the King's Camp, in
order to fight against the Rebels; and, if
they did not give a satisfactory answer to
those Questions, they were committed to
Prison, in order to get others to accuse
them; where many innocent Persons pe∣rished
by long and close Confinement, tho'
nothing could be laid to their Charge.</P>
<P>If in these Examinations they effectually
clear'd themselves of being in the Rebel∣lion,
yet an incredible Number were en∣snar'd
with other unforeseen Enquiries;
some were Imprison'd; some Fin'd above
the Value of their Estates; others were
Condemn'd to Death, for having but seen
and spoken to any of the escap'd Rebels,
after they had fled from <HI>Bothwell</HI>-Bridge;
alledging that it was Treason so to do, and
not to discover and apprehend them.</P>
<P>If neither by Examination, Confession, or De∣lation,
<HI>super Inquirendis,</HI> so it was termed
<PB N="242" REF="341"/>
in their Law,) they were able to reach
them, yet many such were Condemn'd and
Executed even for their Simple-declar'd
Opinion of it, according to the Questions
mention'd before, and which we shall speak
farther of presently.</P></Q>
<P>Nor was the Number small or Inconsiderable
of those who were thus dealt with: There is
scarce a County or Parish, in those Western
Parts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> where several have not been
thus Condemn'd; nor was it eafy to prevent
the poor People being drawn into this Snare,
for when they were brought before the Coun∣cil,
or the Court of Justiciary, it was often ex∣torted
from them by Threatnings of Death, and
sometimes by Torture, and upon this single
Question, in their Courts of justice (<HI>viz.</HI>} <HI>Whe∣ther
the Rising at</HI> Bothwell-<HI>Bridge was Rebellion,
and a Sin against God?</HI> I SAY, many, for re∣fusing
to answer it, waving the Question, and
declaring that they did not think themselves
oblig'd to answer, were Condemn'd, and imme∣diately
led away to Execution, <HI>for the Mercy
of those Courts was such; that</HI> many were Sen∣tenced
in the Morning, and Executed in the
Afternoon; nay, some were led immediately
from the Bar to the Gibbet, where they were
us'd again in the like cruel manner, being not
suffer'd to declare their Innocence, or to speak
to the People; but the Drums, being placed
round them, were kept beating all the Time
of their being upon the Scaffold and Ladder,
as has been mentioned already.</P>
<P>But to return to the Soldiers, to whom, as I
said before, these Cruelties not sufficing, Justice
was transposed. When we were talking of
the Severities of the Courts of Justice, and the
<PB N="243" REF="342"/>
Cruelty of their Executioners, on Pretence of
Rebellion, it was sufficient to call it Murther;
(for Injustice in Form of Law is the Devil re∣presenting
an Angel of Light; and killing inno∣cent
Men by Legal Process is the worst sort
of Murther:) But now we come from Murther
to Massacre, for the Soldiers, being now vested
with Judicial Authority, went up and down like
ravening Wolves, with Mouths open'd to suck
the Blood of the Innocent: They seem'd like
Men clothed with more Power than they un∣derstood,
tho' not more than they desir'd; that
had a Loose given to the Excess of what, by
their Occupation, they delighted in, I mean
Blood; had no Sense of justice; they knew
how to kill, but not how to save; they knew
how to destroy, but not how to spare.</P>
<P>Their grand Enquiry was for <HI>Bothwell-Brigg∣men,</HI>
as they call'd them: If they heard casually
but the least Report of a Man that he was a
<HI>Whig</HI> or a <HI>Cameronian</HI> (for so they began now
to be call'd) their way of Process was no more
than to enter his House, seize upon his Person,
and, telling him he was a Rebel, drag him imme∣diately
out to the Street, and shoot him at a Post.</P>
<P>If the Soldiers saw a Man in the Road who
seem'd in the least shy of them, or that en∣deavour'd
to shun them,they immediately pursu'd
him like Blood-hounds; and, if he fled, fired
upon him without any further Enquiry.</P>
<P>If; upon searching any strange Person, they
found a Bible about him, it was sufficient
to charge him with having been at a Field-Meeting,
or that he was going to one; either of
which was sufficient to set them upon him like
Hounds upon a Hare, when they never ceas'd
pursuing till they had brought him to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="343"/>
If when any were dragging thus to Exe∣cution,
a Stander-by should offer to intercede
for them, or look concern'd, seem to pity them,
or lift up a Sigh for them, they would lay
Hands on them, and cry, “What are you, Sir,
that you feem so much troubled at this?
Wherefore do you pity them? Are they not
the King's Enemies?” And they were all at
the Gallows, you should be glad, if you were
a Friend to the King. Come, can you an∣swer
the Questions? And thus they have
singled out honest Men among the Spectators,
by the meer Trouble which appear'd in their
Faces and Countenances for the Sufferings of
those that have been thus cruelly handled.</P>
<P>And now, to confirm all these Things by
Examples undeniable, the few that are made
publick are indeed sufficient to silence the
Tongues of any that pretend to deny the Fact;
but, alas! they are nothing, compar'd to the
Number of those that many yet living can give
an Account of from their own Knowledge and
Memories.</P>
<P>Besides the publick Accounts given by Name,
and of which Lists have been printed, we find
several Instances of Cruelty not made publick,
especially in this Case of the Soldiers having
Power given to kill and save as they pleased.</P>
<P>A Lieutenant and three Soldiers passing by the
Road, sound a Man sleeping on the Side of a
Bank, and a small Pocket-Bible lying by him;
whereupon one of the Soldiers waking him,
brings him to the Lieutenant. The Lieutenant
ask'd him who he was: He told him his Name,
Place of Abode, and whether he was travelling,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) going to <HI>Fife,</HI> being a Weaver by Trade.
They ask'd him then <HI>if he would pray for the
<PB N="245" REF="344"/>
King.</HI> He said, <HI>Yes, with all his Heart:</HI> Upon
which the Lieutenant was about to let him go;
but one of the Soldiers unhappily put in: <HI>But,
Sir, will you renounce the Covenant?</HI> The Man he∣sitated
a little, but being urged and insulted,
cries out, <HI>Lord, forgive we, that I fear'd to own
thy Work;</HI> and then speaking to the Lieutenant,
<HI>Indeed Sir,</HI> says he, <HI>I'll as soon renounce my Bap∣tism,</HI>
(or to that Purpose,) <HI>I know your Power,
work your Will with me;</HI> upon which they shot
him upon the Spot.</P>
<P>A Party of Dragoons in <HI>Nithsdale</HI> had Infor∣mation
that Six <HI>Bothwell-Brigg-men,</HI> as they
call'd them, were harbour'd in the Houfe of a
Country-man near hand; they immediately be∣set
the House, and, breaking in, they found
Four Men there and the Master of the House;
and, without enquiring whether they were guilty
of the Rising or not, brought them all out of
the Door, and shot them dead, refusing to give
them a Minute's Time to pray to God, but
swearing and blaspheming when it was but beg'd
for by the Persons.</P>
<P>The Writer of this has heard the late Lieu∣tenant-General
<HI>Maitland</HI> express great Abhor∣rence
of the Cruelties committed by Major <HI>Bal∣four,</HI>
Captain <HI>Douglass,</HI> General <HI>Dalziel,</HI> and se∣veral
others, who would take Pains to search
out such Men as they thought did but shun to
be seen, and, with little or no Examination,
shoot them upon the Spot; which he, being
then under Command, could no way prevent:
But many times, when Power was in his Hands,
he either facilitated their Escape, or otherwise
prevented the Mischief intended.</P>
<P>In a Village not far from <HI>Hamilton,</HI> a poor
Tradesman was beset in his House, while at
<PB N="246" REF="345"/>
his Work, by Five Soldiers, his Name <HI>Lawson:</HI>
They called to him to come down the Stairs,
which he refus'd to do; upon which all the
Five Soldiers fir'd at him, but he, being aware,
stood by the Wall of the Chamber and avoided
the Shot, and then call'd to them and ask'd
them wherefore they came to him, he was no
<HI>Bothwell-Brigg-man.</HI> Well then, say the Soldiers,
<HI>come down, and we will do you no Hurt.</HI> The
Man, however, knowing they were not to be
trusted, came down, but got out of his Back
Door, and jumping over two or three low
Stone-Walls of the Gardens, got into the Fields,
and took him to Flight, being very swift of
Foot, and knowing they had just fir'd all their
Pieces: They pursu'd him, and, loading their
Musquets as they run, fir'd at him again several
Shot; but, by good Providence missing him,
the Man eseaped to the Hills, but was heard

<P>The aforesaid Lieutenant-General <HI>Maitland</HI>
was then an Officer among these bloody Troops,
and was, with some Soldiers, quarter'd in Glas∣gow
but, being a Man of generous Principles,
and of too much Humanity to be guilty of
such Things as these, was a great Relief to the
persecuted People, for he shelter'd and pro∣tected
many who otherwise had been murther'd
by the Soldiers; and if he was commanded on
the Service which he abhorr'd so much, (<HI>viz.</HI>)
to fall upon the poor People in their House
or Field-Meetings, would frequently, by trusty
Messengers, give them private Notice, that they
might have Time to disperse and be gone away;
and would often find out some Occasion to make
his Men halt by the Way, that his Messengers
might not come too late.</P>

(much against his Will, being under Command)

every honest Man was in at this time, when their
Life was in the Hands of every Soldier, nor
was the Consequences other than might be ex∣pected
on such Occasions; the Fields, the Roads,
the Villages every Day bearing Witness to the
Murthers that were committed, and to the inju∣rious
and abominable things which the poor Peo∣ple
suffer'd from the Rage of the Soldiers who
were then inhumanely let loose upon them. The
following is but a small part of the Account
of the Bloodshed in this manner in one part of
the Country, and mostly within the Year 1685,
by which may be judg'd a little what was suffer'd
from the rising at <HI>Bollewell</HI> Bridge, which was in
1679 to the Revolution in 1688.</P>
<P><HI>Graham</HI> of <HI>Claverhouse</HI> the same who was after∣wards
Viscount of <HI>Dundee,</HI> and was kill'd at the
Fight at <HI>Gillicranky</HI> in King <HI>William</HI>'s time, was at
this time a most furious Persecutor of these poor
People; it was his Rage in falling upon one of
their Field Meetings, where he met with a Re∣pulse
was the Occasion and beginning of which the
rising at <HI>Bothwell</HI> as have been shewed already.
This Man is said to have kill'd above 100 Men
in this kind of cold blood Cruelty; making it his
business to follow, and pursue poor People thro'
the whole Country, and heaving at his Heels a
Crew of Savages, Highlanders, and Dragoons,
whose sport was in Blood, and whose Diversion
was to haul innocent Men out from their Houses
or hiding Places and Murther them; his Compa∣nion
in this Work was Colonel <HI>James Douglass,</HI>
since call'd Lieutenant General <HI>Douglass.</HI> These
two with their Men kill'd 28 Men in a very few
Days, and at several places in the Shire of <HI>Galloway,</HI>
most of them without the least Evidence of their
being Guilty, all of them without any legal Pro∣secution
<PB N="250" REF="349"/>
and some without To much as Exami∣nation.</P>
<P>At their first coming down they found five Men
in several Prisons, who had been committed by
other Persecutors before their coming: It seems
somebody had maliciously told this<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note, God did not permit him to have time at his Death to pray or repent, but he was kill'd even in the very <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rticle of Victory.</NOTE> <HI>Graham</HI>
that they were of the Whiggs that used the Field
Meetings; upon which without any Oath made
of the Fact, or any Examination of the Men,
without any Trial or other Sentence, than his own
command his bloody Soldiers fetch'd them
all to <HI>Mauchlin,</HI> a Village where his Head Quar∣ters
were, and hang'd them immediately, not
suffering them to enter into any House at their
coming, nor at the Entreaty of the poor Men,
would permit One to lend them a Bible who it
seems offered it, nor allow them a Moment to
pray to God.</P>
<P>Four more Men who were betray'd to him, be∣ing
hid in a House at the Water of <HI>Dee,</HI> and
were at the Time his Men came praying together;
he caused them to be drag'd just to the Door,
and shot them Dead as they came out, without
any Enquiry whether they were the Persons that
he came to apprehend; their being found praying
to God was it seems sufficient Testimony of their
Party and Offence; after this, coming to the same
Place, at two or three Days distance, and under∣standing
the People of the Town had buried
the Bodies, he caused his Men to dig them up
again, and commanded that they should lye in the
Fields: The Names of these four were <HI>John Grier,
Robert Ferguson, Archibald Stuart</HI> and <HI>Robert Stuart.</HI>
<PB N="251" REF="350"/>
At <HI>Camonel</HI> in the County of <HI>Carrick,</HI> he saw
a Man run hastily cross the Street before his
Troop, and as he might suppose did it to escape
from or avoid them, tho' as the People of the
Place related it, the poor Man had no Appre∣hensions
of them, but as he took all Occasions
for his bloody design, he commanded his Men
to shoot this Person, without so much as Exa∣mining
him, or asking who he was, the poor
Mans Name was <HI>Matthew Mckellwrat.</HI></P>
<P>The same Party having intelligence, that there
were several of the Whiggs hid in a great Cave
among the Hills of <HI>Glencairn,</HI> that the Peo∣ple
resorted to them to pray together, and that
several Women carry'd them Provision and Coal
to burn to warm them. Col. <HI>Douglass</HI> sent a
small Party who surrounded the Hill, and drew
five Men out of the Cave, it seems there had been
rear Fifty there just before having met to pray,
but were separated again; had they been all
there, <HI>Douglass</HI> had not had them so cheap, for
being all Arm'd, it was likely they would have
sent him back faster than he came, heaving but
18 Dragoons with him; these five however, who
it seems were betray'd by one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note, After the Revolution this <HI>Watson</HI> who betray'd them was seiz'd by some of the Relations of these poor Men, and put in Prison as <HI>Drumfreis,</HI> but they did not put him to Death as he deserv'd.</NOTE> <HI>Watson,</HI> this Col.
<HI>Douglass</HI> dragg'd out of the Cave and immediate∣ly

The same wretched Gang coming to a House
where they had been inform'd one <HI>Welch</HI> a Field
preacher was harbour'd, or was to be found, they
rush'd violently into the House, but found; not
the Man they sought, neither indeed was he
there; but they found five Men together, with
the Women and Children of the Family all on
their Knees at Prayers; whereupon without Exa∣mining
any farther, they said it was a seditious
Meeting which was forbidden by the Council,
and thereupon instantly dragg'd out the Men and
shot them to Death before the Door.</P>
<P><HI>John Smith,</HI> was shot to Death by two Soldiers
at <HI>Lismchago.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Skillilaw,</HI> was shot by one Lieuuenant

called after him, and the Man not making answer,
nor stopping his Horse, <HI>Graham</HI> caused one of his
Soldiers to shoot him dead, as he rode along,
whereas, upon Enquiry into the matter, it was
found that the poor Man was Deaf and could
not hear him call to him; the murthered Man's
Name was <HI>Robert Auchinleck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>William Adams,</HI> at the <HI>Wallwood</HI> in <HI>Kyle,</HI> going
along the way, and seeing some Soldiers at a
Distance, hid himself in a Thicket thinking to
shun them, but being discover'd by the Soldiers,
they instantly shot him without so much as
asking his Name, or enquiring after any other
Guilt, than his shunning to meet them.</P>
<P>Capt. <HI>Doug;ass</HI> seiz'd a Taylor and shot him
dead, only because he had some small Pieces of
Lead about him, such as the Taylors put in the
<PB N="253" REF="352"/>
Sleeves of Women's Clothes; and another of
that persecuting Family of the <HI>Douglass,</HI> shot
on no other pretence than because
he had a Flint in his Pocket; these things it seems
they call'd Ammunition: At another House he
shot a Man because he attempted to escape from
him, tho' he had no Knowledge of the Man or
any Charge against him.</P>
<P>Several were kill'd in the dark, being shot
by they knew not who, or for what; the High-landers
shot Men for their Sport without asking
them any Questions, and answer'd that they could
not mistake for all the Country were Rebels.</P>
<P>Most of these mentioned above, were massa∣cred
in the Year 1685, and in one Count, be∣sides
many more in all parts of the West Coun∣try;
the Dragoons patrol'd all over the Coun∣try,
by Night as well as by Day, so that the
distress'd People who lay hid in the Mountains,
could not come down to the Houses of their
Friends in the Night, as they usually did for
Succour, and so retreat again in the Morning
before Day; but now they got no Liberty to
come down, but at the utmost hazard; so that
their Wives and Children, or Relations, and
sometimes Charitable and Compassionate Chri∣stian
Friends, went to them to the Hills, and to
the Caves and Holes in the Earth, where they
were harbour'd, to carry them Necessaries and Re∣lief,
and without which they must have perished,
for meer want of Food; and notwithstanding
which they endured in those vast and desolate
Hills, inexpressible hardships, extremities of
Cold, without Covering, without Shelter, with∣out
Fewel in the deepest of Winter, and often
without Food and without Light: A List of
Threescore and Eighteen Men by Name has
<PB N="254" REF="353"/>
been published, who were massacred by the Per∣secutors
named above, and of whom some of
those named here were a Part, but the Number
who were thus hunted down and Murther'd by
the Highlanders, and the Dragoons, in the
whole Country, is not to be reckon'd up, and is
indeed Incredible.</P>
<P>The Writer of these Memoirs, having talked
with many Sober and Judicious Persons, who li∣ved
in that part of the Country at that time, and
were Eye Witnesses to much, of it, found that
they all agreed in this, that many Thousands of
People perished under the violent Hands of these
Men, besides those killed in the Field of Battle
at <HI>Pentland</HI> Hills, <HI>Bothwell,</HI> &amp;c. And one Reve∣rend
Minister of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> assur'd
the Writer hereof, that taking in the People
who dyed in Prisons and in Banishment; there
was an Account taken or above Eighteen Thou∣sand
People, whose Blood these Persecutors
have to Account for, besides the Numbers who
at the time of the Revolution were actually in
Prisons, in the Isle of the <HI>Bass, Dunnotter</HI> Castle,
<HI>Blackness, Edinburgh,</HI> and other Places, amoun∣ting
to a very great Number.</P>
<P>And yet here it cannot be omitted, that to the
Honour of the Cause, these People suffered in,
and in justification of the Principles which they
acted from, we must observe, that their Number
was so far from being diminished, or them∣selves,
or their Ministers, from being discoura∣ged,
that on the contrary, they encreased prodi∣giously
in Number, neither were their Meetings
ever destitute of Ministers, nor were they ever
so discouraged as to give over Meeting for the
publick Worship; resolving not to forfake the
assembling themselves together, where they prai∣sed
<PB N="255" REF="354"/>
God in singleness of Heart, and with Joy
Embraced the Opportunities tho' at the hazard
of their Lives.</P>
<P>I cannot Express this more fully than in the
Words of the Sufferers themselves left upon Re∣cord
by one of their own Fellows in Affliction,
thus, (<HI>viz.</HI>) “To speak of the Numbers, <HI>says he,</HI>
we must do Justice to the Miracle of God's
Working, whereby the very means used to ex∣tirpate
us from the Face of the Earth, was by
the Wise Disposer of all things, made to en∣crease
our Numbers; for that albeit they went
on for many Years imprisoning, banishing, and
butchering our dear Brethren, yet all the Pri∣sons
they could fill with us, and all the Ships
they could freight with us, and all the Gibbets
they could hang us on, could never either ex∣haust
or lessen our Number, but the more we
were Afflicted, the more we grew, and the
design to Destroy us, thro' the Mercy of our
God, prov'd always ruinous to the Destroyers;
and this must be acknowledged to the Praise
of God's Clemency, and the Condemnation of
Man's Cruelty, that when they had Tryed all
ways possible to destroy us, and root us out
from the Earth; after they had hang'd, shot,
tortur'd and banished for Slaves, all they could
catch of us, they were further from their pur∣pose
than when they began: Our Numbers
were not diminished, our Meeaings for Gospel
Ordinances were not disappointed, but we
enjoy'd the administrations in their Purity, and,
Power, with greater Certainty, and met toge∣ther
in greater Numbers than ever, for than
our Numbers encreased more and more:” That
this was true, their Enemies openly acknow∣ledg'd,
and this enraged the Persecutors so much
<PB N="256" REF="355"/>
the more, and that to such a degree that they
once resolv'd on a general Massacre of all together
by the Troops of <HI>Heretors,</HI> Dragoons and High-land
Men, who, forming themselves into a great
Army, spread themselves from one Side of a
whole County to the other, having their Men
placed, marching single at a great Distance, but
always one in Sight of the other; so marching
forward, every one straight before him, they
by this Means searched the Rocks, Rivers,
Woods, wasts, Mountains, Mosses, and every
the most private and retired Places of the Coun∣ty,
where they thought we were hidden; so that
it was impossible any thing could escape them:
And yet so true were the Mountain-Men, <HI>as their
Persecutors call'd them,</HI> to one another, that in all
that famous March they found not one Man,
tho' many a good Man perhaps, with trembling
Heart and Hands lift up to Heaven for Pro∣tection,
saw them, and were pass'd by them un∣discover'd.</P>
<P>Failing in any Enterprize of this Nature, and
being disappointed in their Prey, always, re∣doubled
their Fury at those who fell into their
Hands: It was not far from <HI>Edinburgh</HI> that a
Field-Meeting was appointed, and not the Mi∣nister
only, but a great many People went out
of that City, at the Hazard of their Lives, to
have been present at it; when, on the Way,
they got Notice that the Appointment had been
discovered, and that Soldiers were coming
to fall upon the People. The faithful
Spies, that gave them Intelligence of this, did
it so timely and so prudently, that the Sol∣diers
found no-body assembled at the Place: But
their Rage doubling at the Disappointment, they
fell upon every one they met in their Return,
<PB N="257" REF="356"/>
and chiefly upon the poor Women and Maid-Servants,
charging them with being actually
going to the Field-Meeting, tho not present at it:
Besides the Rudeness and Insolence of another Na∣trure
which they offer'd to the Women, as upon
all such Occasions was their Manner, they car∣ry'd
about 30 Women to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and Four
or Five Men, where they were put in Prison,
some in the Tolbooth, some in the Correction-House,
tho' Persons of good Fashion and Fa∣milies;
and of these 7 or 8 were at several
times put to death, principally upon their re∣fusing
to renounce <HI>the Covenant,</HI> and to make
Declarations condemning their Principles; and on
acknowledging their being on the Way to a
their Meeting. One poor Servant-Maid, be∣longing
to a Citizen's Wife of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> being
with her Mistress, and having her Mistress's
Bible under her Arm, was taken by the Soldiers,
her Mistress escaping by running into a Stable:
The poor Maid, being examin'd upon no other
Suspicion but having the Bible, boldly own'd
she was going to the Field-Meeting, but refused
to accuse her Mistress, or any one else; where-upon
they threaten'd her with the Torture, to
make her confess. She answer'd, she was ready
to endure Torture or Death, and talk'd to them
with such Presence of Mind, such Strength of
Reasoning, and such Chearfulness, as made them
both mad and asham'd: They sentenc'd her to
be hang'd in the Street of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and ano∣ther
young Woman with her. She receiv'd the
Sentence with rejoycing, and lifting up her
Hands and Eyes, gave God Thanks, that had
thought her worthy to suffer for her Testimony
to the Truth of Religion, and the Purity of his
Worihip.</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="357"/>
The Cruelty of the Persecutors was farther
remarkable in these poor young Women's Suf∣fering,
that they brought them to their Execu∣tion
with two Murtherers, (<HI>viz.</HI>) two Wretches
condemn'd for murthering their Bastard-Chil∣dren,
mixing thera together that the Common
People might imagine they were all guilty of
such Crimes, or that at least they might not be
known asunder by the Crowd of Spectators; but
they easily discover'd the Difference by the Man∣ner
of their Behaviour, while these two appear'd
with smiling Countenances, singing Psalms, and
in a chearful inimitable Frame; the other de∣jected,
confused, and, to say all in a Word, like
what they really were.</P>
<P>It would be endless to give an Account of the
Manner of Execution, the Behaviour of the Suf∣fering
People in their Imprisonment and at their
Execution, or the Cruelty of the Judges in Tor∣turing
those who were brought before them,
with that truly barbarous Engine for Torrture
unknown to all the World but to <HI>Scotland,</HI> call'd
the <HI>Boot;</HI> by which, the Leg being put in, and
the Wedges driven with a great Maul by the
Executioner, the Bone has been entirely com∣press'd,
and the Marrow of the Bone has been
seen to burst out thro' the macerated Flesh.</P>
<P>Yet it was not found that any one of those
who were thus tortur'd yielded to the Tor∣mentors,
either to accuse themselves or betray
others. Mr. <HI>Hugh Mackail,</HI> a young Man of
about 24 Years of Age, and being what they
call a Probationer for the Office of a Minister,
but not yet a Minister ordain'd, was Licentiat,
and had preach'd some time before the turning
out of the Presbyterians at the Restoration, he
is an eminent Example of this: His Case, in
short, io as follows;</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="358"/>
Being a young Man of promising Parts and
great Elocution, he was appointed to preach in
the Great Church, at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> the Sabbath be∣fore
the Turning out of the Ministers; and his
Subject, as might be expected, related to the
cruel Persecutions which the Church of God, in
all Ages, had undergone from the Enemies of
jesus Christ and his Kingdom; it was sug∣gested
that he carry'd on a Parallel between
the Persecutions of the People of God in the
<HI>Jewish</HI> Church, and those of the People of God
in the Presbyterian Church ot <HI>Scotland:</HI> And it
was very particular and surprizing to many that
heard him, when he told them the Church were
persecuted by a <HI>Pharaoh</HI> upon the Throne, a Ha∣man
in the State, and a <HI>Judas</HI> in the Church;
by whom he was suappos'd to mean King <HI>Charle's</HI>
the IId. then reigning upon the Throne; the Duke
of <HI>Landerdale,</HI> then principal Agent in <HI>Scots</HI> Af∣fairs;
and the Archbishop of St. <HI>Adrew's,</HI> an
Apostate from the True Church, and then the
most false Betrayer, and at that time, the most
implacable Persecutor of that very Church which
he had before been a Member and Minister of.</P>
<P>It seems the Archbishop, who was seldom
known to forgive any one, had not forgotten, this
tho' it was in the Year 1661, four Years be∣fore;
And it was not many Days after his
preaching, that Sermon, that a Party of Soldiers
was sent to seize him; but he got notice of
their Design, and convey'd himself away into the
West, where he continued retir'd till the Affair
of <HI>Penthland,</HI> of which Mention has been made,
when being oblig'd, as he thought, to join with
his Brethren in renewing the Covenant, he went
to <HI>Lanerk,</HI> where that solemn renewing the Co∣venant
was perform'd, as has been observ'd
<PB N="260" REF="359"/>
Page .... When they were defeated at
<HI>Pentland,</HI> it happen'd this young Man was taken
and brought in Prisoner to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The
Archbishop remember'd the Sermon and the
Man, and had his full Revenge upon this Oc∣casion,
as the Event shew'd: Mr. <HI>Mackail</HI> was
not taken in the Action, neither was he in it,
nor was he taken in the Company of any that
were in the Action; but meerly, and unpolitick∣ly
enough, as travelling on the Road; for the
Weakness of his Constitution having render'd
him unable to bear the Fatigues of marching,
or the Rigour of the Season, he was oblig'd to
leave the Body of Men who march'd after to
<HI>Pentland</HI>-Hills being no longer able to endure
it; so parting from them at a Place call'd
<HI>Cramond-Bridge,</HI> he was taken by some Country∣men
who were sent out to stop the Passages, to
prevent the Escape of the Rebels, as they were
then call'd.</P>
<P>Being taken and brought to Council, he was
committed to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>Tolbooth,</HI> and several times
examin'd, and at length tortur'd to make him
consels himself guilty, wrhich however they
could not make him do; the Archbishop of
St. <HI>Andrews</HI> being present all the Time of his
Torture, as one of the Judges, appointing and
directing the same: A terrible Work indeed it
was for a Christian Bishop! but very agreeable
to the rest of his Character, if we may believe
what was generally said of him at that Time a∣mong
even indifferent Men.</P>
<P>They question'd him likewise, <HI>upon Torture,</HI>
to declare what was the original Cause and
Design of that Infurrection. He answer'd, he
knew not any more of it, than <HI>that it was oc∣casion'd
by the Cruelty of Sir</HI> James Turner, <HI>who
<PB N="261" REF="360"/>
having been resisted by some People who could no longer
bear his Violence; that Resistance having exposed
them to the Revenge of the Soldiers, and the Appre∣hensions
of that Revenge having made them desperate,
that very Accident drove them to take Arms,</HI> as
has been observ'd before in the Accounts given
of that Action.</P>
<P>They were not satisfy'd with, this answer,
but press'd him to declare all he knew of that
Affair; and, upon his declaring he knew <HI>no
more,</HI> they order'd him to be tortured: At every
Blow the Tormentors struck, they ask'd if he
would confess; and upon receiving still the
same answer (<HI>viz.) That he knew no more than he
had told them,</HI> they renewed the Torture till he
had received Eleven Strokes of the Hang-man.</P>
<P>It seems they had been heated the same Morn∣ing,
and their Fury encreas'd, by having just
before torturM another Gentlemen (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>Ni∣cholson
of Corsack,</HI> in a most terrible manner.</P>
<P>Here, for the Information of the <HI>English</HI> Rea∣der,
or other Stranger to the Customs and Ju∣dicatories
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it is necessary to note,
that this Examination by Torture is always done
in the Presence ot the Judges, who order the
Tormentors when to begin, how long to pro∣ceed,
and when to stop, and interrogate the
Sufferer all the time, and in the Interval of their
Blows.</P>
<P>“Mr. <HI>Mackail, says an Author who relates that
Story,</HI> having before declar'd ingenuously all
he knew, could not be mov'd by the Torture
to express any Impatience or Bitterness, tho'
the Torture was in it self very violent and
terrible, by reason of the Compressure of the
Flesh, Sinews, and even the Bones, by the
Force of woodden Wedges driven in with a
<PB N="262" REF="361"/>
Hammer in a double and unusual Measure
even to 10 or 11 Strokes, with considerable
Intervals; all which he sustain'd most con∣stantly
and christianly: But before he received
the last three Strokes, he protested solemnly
in the Sight of God, That he could say no
more, tho' all the Joints of his Body were in
as great Torture as that poor Leg; and de∣sires
to know what could hinder them to be∣lieve
one of his Profession, who had so so∣lemnly
declared, as in the Sight of God, that
he knew no more than he had told, <HI>viz.</HI>
That, to the best of his Knowledge, the Ri∣sing
in the West was meerly occasional, upon
Discontent between the People in the <HI>Stewartry</HI>
of <HI>Galloway</HI> and Sir <HI>James Turner,</HI> to which
every one did run as their Hearts mov'd
them, when they heard of it.”</P>
<P>The Violence of this Torment, threw him
into a Fever, and yet could not these merciful
Judges be prevail'd with to respite his Appearing
before them above one Day, tho' two Physicians
and a Surgeon certify'd his dangerous Condition,
and he petition'd for a Delay on that Account:
Accordingly the next Day he was rather dragg'd
or carry'd than went to their Bar, and was con∣demn'd
to die; on the third Day after which
was executed, accordingly.</P>
<P>There is another of these Sufferers who can∣not
be forgot when we are Recording the Zeal
of the Church of <HI>Scotland's</HI> Martyrs, who, in
Imitation of the Primitive Zeal of the firft Cen∣turies,
offer'd himself to the Sacrifice, without
any one laying Hand on him. This was <HI>James
Nicol of Peeble.</HI></P>
<P>He was occasionally at <HI>Edinburgh</HI> when three
of the Western People were to be brought to
<PB N="263" REF="362"/>
their Assize or their Trial, for refusing to an∣swer
the wicked ensharing Questions so often
mention'd in these Memoirs. He went to the
Justiciary Court to see them Try'd: It grieved
his Soul to see three innocent Men deliver'd, as
meek Lambs, into the Hands of the Butchers,
to be slaughter'd: It mov'd his Passion to see the
Tyrannical Behaviour of the cruel judges and
Persecutors, insulting and reviling the Sufferers;
and much ado he had, as he express'd himself,
to restrain his Anger from breaking out upon
the Spot, and from reproaching them with shed∣ding
innocent Blood; but was in part satisfy'd
and appeas'd, when he heard the three Sufferers,
who were his dear Friends and Brethren in the
Cause of God, answer with such Chearfulness
and Courage as put their Enemies to Shame.</P>
<P>He went from the Court however grieved in
his Spirit, having seen them Condemn'd, and
heard the bloody Sentence pronounc'd; and
that, it being then about 11 o'th' Clock, they
were order'd to be carry'd not back to Prison,
but from the Court where they received their
Sentence, to the Place of Execution.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Nicol,</HI> not intending to see the sad Sight,
order'd his Horse to be brought out about One
o'th' Clock, to return to his own House, but was
oblig'd to stop at the West Port of the City to
have his Saddle mended; while he was staying
there, he saw the People running, and, asking
what it was for, was told the three honest Men
were bringing to the Place of Execution, and
looking up the Street saw them ascend the
Scaffold, which was in View of the Place where
he stood: This moved him to walk up the
Grass Market to see them die Now he was
no longer able to contain, being moved with a
<PB N="264" REF="363"/>
strong Zeal against these Murtherers: But he
crys out in the midst of the throng; <HI>they had mur∣ther'd
Three of God's Servants, contrary to their own
Laws, and in a most Barbarous and Inhumane manner.</HI>
Hereupon he was immediately apprehended,
this was on the 10th of <HI>August</HI> 1684, on the 18th
he was examined before the Council, where they
were astonished to find that he, against whom
they had no Accusation, was bold to declare
himself in the most dangerous Questions, and
rather sought the Martyrdom he expected, than
that he would endeavour to avoid what they had
to Inflict, as the Reader will see by the manner
of their Interrogating him, and his Answers
penn'd by himself as follows.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST,</HI> I was Interrogate by two in a Room
privately thus. Question, Was you at <HI>Both∣wel
Bridge? A.</HI> I am not bound to be my own
Accuser; I am not (said one of them) to desire
you, but only say upon your Honest Word, that
you were not there. <HI>A.</HI> I am not bound to sa∣tisfy
you, but Prove what you have to say against
me, and especially you, till I come before my
Accusers. Well, said he, I am one of them.
Then I Answered, I was there. <HI>Q.</HI> How came
you to rise in Arms against the King? <HI>A.</HI> Because
he has broken the Covenant of the Lord my
God. <HI>Q.</HI> Was the Prelate's Death Murther? <HI>A.</HI>
No, it was not Murther. <HI>Q.</HI> Was <HI>Hackstoun's</HI>
Death Murther? <HI>A.</HI> That it was indeed. <HI>Q.</HI>
How dare you own the Covenant, seeing the King
gave Orders to burn it by the Hand of the
Hangman! <HI>A.</HI> Yes, I dare own, for altho' ye
should escape the hand of Men for so doing, yet
ye shall all pay for it, e're all be done, and that
<PB N="265" REF="364"/>
to purpose: As for me I would not do it for the
whole Earth. Then I was Interrogate by other
two, who asked some frivolous Questions which
I baffled to silence. Then I was brought in be∣fore
the Bloody Crew. What now, Sir, said
they, do ye own the King's Authority? <HI>A.</HI> I
own all things that the Precious Word of God
owns in less or more, and all Faithful Magistrates.
<HI>Q.</HI> But do you not own King <HI>Charles
also! A.</HI> I dare not for a World, because it is
Perjury, for he has unking'd himself in a high
degree, <HI>and that</HI> in doing all things contrary to
the Word of God and Confession of Faith, and
Catechisms Larger and Shorter. <HI>Q.</HI> Know ye to
whom ye are Speaking? <HI>A.</HI> I know I am before
Men. But (said one of them) ye are speaking
to the <HI>Chancellor</HI> and <HI>Members of Council,</HI> Sir, But,
said I; AS I have told you already that he has
unking'd himself, SO have you degraded your
selves from being Princes. <HI>Q.</HI> If the King were
here what would you say, Sir? <HI>A.</HI> I know how
I ought to speak to the King, if he were King,
<HI>Sir,</HI> is ordinarily said to him; and so to let you know
that I am no Quaker, or Erroneous in any thing,
but a pure <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and of a Gospel, Aposto∣lick
Spirit, I call you <HI>Sirs,</HI> because ye are Noble∣men
by Birth, but not because ye are my Judges.
<HI>Q.</HI> Will ye not say God bless the King's Majesty!
<HI>A.</HI> I dare not bless them whom God hath reje∣cted;
“If any Man bring another Doctrine then
ye have received bid him not, God speed, nor
receive him into your House <HI>2 John</HI> 10. And
<HI>Psalms</HI> 16. verse 4th says <HI>David,</HI> Their Drink
Offerings of Blood will I not Offer, nor take
up their names into my Lips, <HI>viz.”</HI> Them
that hasten after other Gods, and therefore I dare
not Pray for him. <HI>Q.</HI> And will ye not Pray for
<PB N="266" REF="365"/>
him? <HI>A.</HI> If he belongs to the Election of Grace,
he has a part of my Prayers; and also if he were
a King that had keeped Covenant with God I
would giye him a double share, and make menti∣on
of his Name; but he is an Apostate, (So,
my Friends, they looked still one to another at
every Question and Answer) <HI>Q.</HI> How Old are
you Sir, <HI>A.</HI> I am 51 Years. <HI>Q.</HI> How dare you
own the Covenants seeing we have burnt it by
the hand of the Hangman. <HI>A.</HI> Sir, I dare own
them upon all Perrils whatsomever to the utmost
of my Power, all the Days of my Life. And with
that they Smiled and Laughed one to ano∣ther
and to me; and said my Days were near an
end; I said I am now in your Power, but if ye
take my Blood, ye shall take Innocent Blood
upon your selves, as in <HI>Jer.</HI> 26. As for me, I am
in your Hands do to me as seems good and meet unto you,
but know for a certainty that if ye put me to Death ye
shall bring Innocent Blood upon your selves and on this
City, and <HI>the Inhabitants thereof.</HI> And as for me,
if ye take my Blood, it's as Innocent Blood as
ever ye did take; for I did never wrong any
Man to this Day.</P>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you go to the Church? <HI>A.</HI> I went ay
to the Church, where I could get any faithful Mi∣nister
to go to; but for your Prelates Kirks, and
<HI>Baal's Priests,</HI> I never heard any of them, nor
never intends to do, if I were to live an hun∣dred
Years: But (said they) Ye shall not live
long now Sir.</P>
<P>Then on <HI>Tuesday</HI> they called me before them,
again, being the 19th Day of this Instant. <HI>Q.</HI>
What say ye the Day, do you adhere to all ye
said Yesterday? <HI>A.</HI> I adhere to all and hail
upon all Perrils whatsomever. <HI>Q.</HI> Do ye approve
of <HI>Bothwell Bridge? A.</HI> Yes I do. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you
<PB N="267" REF="366"/>
go to the Kirk at <HI>Peebles? A.</HI> No, nor never in∣tends
to go there, nor no Place else, which per∣tains
to the perjured Prelates. <HI>Q.</HI> Do you own
the Covenants? <HI>A.</HI> I adhere to every <HI>Point</HI> of
them. <HI>Q.</HI> Do ye own <HI>Airs-Moss, Sanquhair, Ru∣therglen
and Lanerk Declarations? A.</HI> Yes, I do;
because they are agreeable to the Covenants, and
Work of Reformation. Many more Que∣stions
they asked, which I cannot now particu∣larly
remember, but I told them in general, That
I was against <HI>Popery, Prelacy, Malignacy</HI> and <HI>Pro∣phanity,</HI>
and all that is against sound Doctrine,
Discipline, Worship and Government; and all
Errors whatsomever, which are contrary to sound
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Doctrine, be what they will; for
there is none other right, but erroneous; how
fair a Face soever they have, which shall be found
not agreeable to the Apostles Doctrine. And
then they read some thing of what I had said, and
questioned if I would subscribe what I had said.
I answered, No, <HI>Q.</HI> Can ye write! <HI>A.</HI> Yes, I
can write? Then do it, said they: I said,
I would not do it at all, Now, my Friends, I
say these are but part of my Interrogations.</P>
<P>Again I was brought before the Justiciary (as
they call themselves) on the 20th of this Instant,
and interrogate thus: <HI>Q.</HI> What now, Sir, what
think you of your self the Day? <HI>A.</HI> I praise my
GOD, I am the same I was. <HI>Q.</HI> What think ye
of what ye said Yesterday before the <HI>Chancellor</HI>
and the <HI>Council? A.</HI> I hold all, and decline no∣thing;
no not one Ace. <HI>Q.</HI> Were ye at <HI>Bothwel
Bridge? A.</HI> Yes, that I was. <HI>Q.</HI> Had ye Arms?
<HI>A.</HI> Yes that I had. One of them said, <HI>GOD
help you:</HI> And I said, I wote none of ye can pray
for your self: said he, I wish you better nor
<PB N="268" REF="367"/>
ye do your self: But I said, No: for ye would
have me disown my great LORD, the King of
<HI>Zion,</HI> and obey Man; yea, base Men; <HI>whose Breath
is in their Nostriles,</HI> who give out Laws and Com∣mands
contrary to his. <HI>Q.</HI> How dare ye rise in
Arms against the King? <HI>A. It is better to
obey GOD than Man,</HI> and he is an Enemy to GOD.
<HI>Q.</HI> Would ye rise yet in Arms for the Covenants
against the King's Laws, if ye had the Occasion?
<HI>A.</HI> Yes, that I would, say the contrary who will,
upon all Peril. <HI>Q.</HI> What think ye of your self
in spoiling the Country of Horse and Arms, Sir?
<HI>A.</HI> Sir, I had not the worth of a Spur Whang of
any Man's, but was mounted of Horse and Arms
of my own. <HI>Q.</HI> Where have ye been all this
Time? <HI>A.</HI> Sometimes here and there, in <HI>En∣land</HI>
and <HI>Scotland. Q.</HI> Whom have ye conver∣sed
with? <HI>A.</HI> I was about my Business, being a
Merchant. They said ye have been about ano∣ther
Business; for ye are found to be a <HI>Fugitive</HI>
and <HI>a Vagabond. A.</HI> I have been a Merchant from
my Youth. <HI>Q.</HI> But where had ye your Chamber
in this Town? <HI>A.</HI> I had none these several Years.
<HI>Q.</HI> Where quarter ye in this Town? <HI>A.</HI> I have
not been much in it these 7 or 8 Years: <HI>Q.</HI> But
where was ye the Night, and the last Night be∣fore
the Execution? <HI>A.</HI> I was not in Town, I
came but in to Port just when the first was
cast over. Then they looked one to another,
and whispered together; But they would
fain have had me wronging my Landlords in all
the Parts of the Country, and in all Burghs;
but Glory to my LORD, I have wronged none
yet, nor yet hopes to do; for it was ay my Care,
and Prayer to GOD earnestly, that I might wrong
no Man, and that I had rather suffer before any
were wronged by me, which he has keeped me
<PB N="269" REF="368"/>
from to this Day: Then they read what I had
said. <HI>Q.</HI> Will ye subscribe what ye have said.
<HI>A.</HI> No, no. <HI>Q.</HI> Can ye write, Sir? <HI>A</HI> Yes,
that I can. Well, said they, write down, That
he can, but will not. They told me five or six
Times, that my Time should not be long, and
said to me, Will ye have a Minister? <HI>A.</HI> I will
have none of your <HI>Baal's Priests.</HI></P>
<P>After these Interrogations, and that they had
left him for Two or Three Days, on the 22th on<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
brought him the Copy of his Indictment, telling
him at the same Time, that on the 27th he
would receive his Sentence, and that he would be
carryed directly from the Bar to the Scaffold,
which was done accordingly, and where he
Dy'd with the same resolute undaunted Courage,
that he had behaved with all along.</P>
<P>There was yet another small action in Arms,
which the Writers of those Times say little of,
they are asham'd to call it Rebellion, they would
call it a persuit of Murtherers, but <HI>the Fact was
thus;</HI> the Number of the Persons proscrib'd was
prodigiously Great, who flying into Dens, and
Holes and Caves of the Earth, lay concealed in
the Hills and Mountains, from whence by the
vigilance of their Enemies, they were frequently
dragg'd out to Execution and Death, either with
or without Process, as has been said. Sometimes as
Occasion offered, these distress'd People would
get together either for their Field Meetings, or
to shift from Place to Place, as Occasion offer'd
for their Relief, and that they might not be a
prey to every single Soldier or Laird, that
should meet them Naked and Unarm'd, they
carry'd Arms for their Defence; so long only as
they were together, separating again as they had
Occasion, and then laying by their Weapons.</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="369"/>
One of these Parties with Mr. <HI>Richard Cameron</HI>
their Minister, the same from whom these Men
were after called <HI>Cameronians,</HI> having been toge∣ther
some Days but with no other view, than
their own Security as above; were pursued by the
Dragoons, and being surprized as they were ly∣ing
down upon the Grass for refreshment, at a
place call'd <HI>Aird-Moss,</HI> they were oblig'd to fight:
The Dragoons who came upon them were about
120 Men, being 3 Troops; the persecuted People
were about 40 Foot indifferently Arm'd, and 26
Horse; the Horse were led by <HI>David Hackston,
Es{que}</HI> of <HI>Rathillet,</HI> a Gentleman of a good Family
and allyed to some of the best Families in <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
he had been proscrib'd long before for the
killing the Arch-bishop of St. <HI>Andrews,</HI> tho' <HI>as
has been observ'd,</HI> he was the only Man of that
Company who refused to have any Hand in it.—
Some say he refused, because he would not have
had him kill'd, but others say he refused, because
he formerly had a declar'd Quarrel against him
Personally, and would not suffer it to be said that
he executed his private Revenge; be that as it
will, it is allow'd by all that he was not an actor
in the Death of the Bishop, any way whatsoever,
but that being with the Persons who kill'd him,
he separated from them, and refused to be con∣cern'd
in it:</P>
<P>Being forced thus to Fight as above, with so
unequal Numbers, Mr. <HI>Hackston</HI> follow'd by 15
Horse, charged up to the very Faces of the Dra∣goons,
and after giving them a Fire from their
Carabines, broke into the body of them, where
having shewed all the Marks of Bravery and Gallan∣try
possible, being surrounded by Numbers and o∣ver
power'd, the most of them were Kill'd or
Wounded: Mr. <HI>Hackston seeing</HI> his Men broken,
<PB N="271" REF="370"/>
fought like a Lyon, and with a desperate Courage
made his way quite thro' the Enemy, Kil∣ling
and wounding several of them with his own
Hand; and being got clear, and without recei∣ving
any considerable Wound, he made off, but
was closely pursued by 4 Dragoons; the good∣ness
of his Horse carryed him from them, and
he was in a fair way to have escap'd, when his
Horse plung'd into a Bog, from whence he could
not get him out: Being thus un-horst a Dragoon
came up to him who knew him, and offered him
Quarter, which he refused, and fought him with
his Sword, and would have Master'd him, but
Three other Dragoons surrounding him, they
knock't him down, giving him several Wounds
in the Head, and so took him Prisoner.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Cameron</HI> fighting as boldly at the Head of
the other part of the Horse, was Killed, and his
Head cut off, and carryed with the Prisoners to
<HI>Edinburgh.</HI> The Foot being rid down by the
Dragoons and Dispersed, fled to the Hills, a∣bout
17 of them were kiled or taken, and the
rest escaped. They carryed Mr. <HI>Hackston</HI> Woun∣ded
as he was to <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where they led him,
and Three more of the Prisoners taken at the
same place in Triumph thro' the City on a Horse,
with his Face to the Horse's Tail, Mr. <HI>Cameron's</HI>
Head stuck on the point of a Halberd, being car∣ry'd
before him, and another Head in a Sack: His
Examination, his resolute Answers, his horrible
Torture, and his cruel Execution, are well known
to all <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>He had been several Times, carryed before
the Justiciary Court, <HI>as they were call'd, for he
would not call them so,</HI> where he refused to answer
to any Questions whatsoever, declining their Ju∣risdiction,
and protesting against their Authority.
<PB N="272" REF="371"/>
But they resolv'd to treat him for it, in a Me∣thod
which they doubted not, would bring him
to submit to them, wherein however they failed,
and were most effectually disappointed; for nei∣ther
was their threats of Torture, the barbarous
loading him with Irons, who had seven Wounds
upon him, the refusing to let those Wounds be
Drest for some Time, no nor at last the Torture
it self, prevail with him to answer them.</P>
<P>They would have had him confess the Mur∣ther
of the Archbishop, but he would not;
then they would have had him deny it, but nei∣ther
would he do that, but steddily adher'd to
his Protestation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That they had usurped
the Supremacy over the Church, which belong'd
alone TO JESUS CHRIST, and esta∣blish'd
Idolatry, Perjury, and other Abominati∣ons;
and in Confiscating themselves therein, had
persecuted God's People, and shed innocent
Blood, and for this Reason, he would have no∣thing
to say to them, but Declared them open
Enemies, to Christ's Kingdom, Competitors
with him, for his Crown and Power, and utterly
declin'd them as <HI>Judges.</HI> This was the substance
of his Answers, upon several Times being
brought before them, and it is no Wonder, that
they were exceedingly Provok'd at him, as they
soon shew'd they were.</P>
<P>Upon <HI>Friday July</HI> 30, being again brought be∣fore
the <HI>Counsel,</HI> it was asked of him if he had
any other thing to say? He answered, That
which I have said I will Seal it. Then they told
him that they had something to say to him, and
commanded him to fit down and receive his Sen∣tence,
which willingly he did; but told them
they were all Murderers, for all that Power they
had was derived from Tyranny, and that these
<PB N="273" REF="372"/>
Years by-gone, they have not only Tyrannized
over the Church of GOD, but have also grinded
the Faces of the Poor; so that Oppression, Blood∣shed,
Perjury, and many Murders were to be
found in their Skirts, upon which he was incon∣tinent
carried away to the Scaffold at the Mercat-Cross
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> where he died with great

which are as follows.</P>
<P>It is impossible to relate all the particulars, of
their Persecution, either as to the cruelty of the
Persecutors, or the constancy of the Sufferers: what
has been said, will serve to open the Eyes of all who

with Abhorrence of the Practices, and of
the very Names and Memories of the Persons
who exercised such Cruelties on their <HI>Christian</HI>
Brethren.</P>
<P>I say Brethren, because to the Dishonour of
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Name, it is said that these Perse∣cutors
were call'd <HI>Protestants.</HI></P>
<P>There is but one thing that either ev<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was, or
indeed could be said to Extenuate the Charge and
great Pains has been taken to possess the World
with the Notion (<HI>viz.</HI>) that these Men were
<HI>Mad-Men,</HI> Enemies to Government, to Monar∣chy
and to Civil Society, that they denyed Ma∣gistracy
it self, as well as the Person and Govern∣ment
<PB N="274" REF="373"/>
of the King, and that they were executed
as Rebels, not as Religious Persons.</P>
<P>It is needless to answer to any part of this
Charge; the prosssion of the Sufferers at the
Place of Execution, and upon all other Occasions
against the Enemies they opposed, making it
clear that they did not oppose Government or
Monarchy as such; but Wicked, Perjur'd and
Persecuting <HI>Governors;</HI> These they did oppose,
and declare against, as Enemies to God and their
Country; and as breakers of Sacred Oaths and
Covenants, made both with God and Man: These
they Opposed, and thought themselves bound in
Conscience to do so, as being discharg'd from all
<HI>Civil</HI> Allegiance to them, by the Breach of their
Coronation Engagements; and of all <HI>Religious</HI> En∣gagements
to them, by the breaking their solemn
Oath to God and his Church; and turning Pers∣cutors
of that very Church they had Sworn to
maintain; and this they did on the same Arguments
which justify'd the Revolution, and on which
the <HI>Protestant</HI> Succession of <HI>Hannover</HI> is now foun∣ded;
<HI>to wit,</HI> of taking Arms against perjur'd Prin∣ces,
who break their solemn Compact with God
and their People; Renouncing and Deposing
them, and excluding both them and their Race;
and blessed be God who has given such a Testi∣mony
in our Days, to the Memory of his Saints,
and to the truth of the Doctrine and Principles,
which these faithful Martyrs in <HI>Scotland</HI> suffered
for, by bringing the whole Nation, nay even
some of the very Persecutors themselves, to take
up those very Principles, with respect to Govern∣ment
and Obedience, that those suffering Christi∣ans
Dy'd for; and to Expel and Depose, reject and
cast off that very Race, and one of those very
Kings as Tyrants and Robbers, breakers of their
<PB N="275" REF="374"/>
Oaths, and injurious to the People, which these
good People were Persecuted and Murthered for
rejecting before. And therefore even the De∣claration
at <HI>Torwood</HI> as it was call'd, where they
Excommunicated the King, and which the Ene∣mies
of these good People pretented, to be En∣thusiastick,
Devellish, Rebellious and Antichri∣stian,
and for which said good People were Cen∣sur'd,
even by their Brethren who acce pted of
the Indulgences. I say, that very Excommuni∣cation
is expresly founded upon the same Grounds,
as was afterwards the renouncing the King by
the Revolution, with this Difference only, that
the Reasons given by Mr. <HI>Cargil,</HI> Mr. <HI>Cameron</HI>
and the People then call'd <HI>Cameronians</HI> in the De∣claration
of the <HI>Queens-Ferry,</HI> and the Excom∣munication
of <HI>Torwood,</HI> contain all that is under∣stood
in the Memorial to the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI>
from the People of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> to invite him to
assist them in Arms against the same King, and
much more.</P>
<P>To make this clear, I here give you that fa∣mous
Excommunication, pronounced by Mr.
<HI>Donald Cargil</HI> at <HI>Torwood, Anno</HI> 1684 and only
desire the impartial Reader, to compare it with
the Memorials abovenam'd, and see if it be pos∣sible
for any <HI>British Protestant,</HI> who owns the Ju∣stice
of the Revolution, to reflect upon the Zeal
of these People, without blushing for himself,
and the whole Nation, that they did not see and
abhor the Tyranny of those Reigns sooner: Then
they had joy<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d with these People, instead of censu∣ring
their Zeal: The Revolution had then been
brought about, without Foreign help at all; the
Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> had then been call'd over as
peaceably as King <HI>George,</HI> to take possession of
the Crown, and the Blood of near Twenty Thou∣sand
<PB N="276" REF="375"/>
People, who were one way or other Murther'd
or Destroy'd, by that now abdicated race of Ty∣rants,
and their bloody Administration had been
saved.</P>
<P>What a shame it is to us, and how much to the
Honour of these persecuted People, that THEY
could thus see the Treachery and Tyranny of
those Reigns, when we saw it not; or rather that
they had so much Honesty of Principle, and o∣bey'd
so strictly the Dictates of Conscience, as to
bear their Testimony Early, Nobly, and Glori∣ously,
to the truth of God, and the rights of
their Country, both Civil and Religious, while
we all, tho' seeing the same Things, and equal∣ly
convinc'd of its being Right, yet betray'd the
cause of Liberty and Religion, by a sinful Silence,
and a dreadful Cowardice; not joyning to
help the Lord, or the People of the Lord, a∣gainst
the Mighty, sitting still and seeing our
Brethren Slaughter'd and Butchered, in Defence
of their Principles, which our Consciences told
us, <HI>even then,</HI> were founded on the Truth, and
by those Tyrants, who we knew deserv'd to be
rejected both of God and the Nation, and who
afterwards we did reject accordingly: <HI>But to Pro∣ceed.</HI></P>
<P>As those Suffering People are abundantly ju∣stifyed
by the Practice of the whole Nation, in
the Revolution, so I must add, that they are a∣bundantly
acquitted of that weak and unjust
Charge, mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> of their being Ene∣mies
to Government, and refusing to submit to
Lawful Authority, by their behaviour in the Re∣volution;
their Chearful joining in it, and their
being the first that Petitioned the Parliameut to
make the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> King, and promising
<PB N="277" REF="376"/>
all Dutiful Submission to such a King, as they
knew would rule in Righteousness, and Defend,
not Destroy the Heretage of the Lord; but as
this belongs to the next part of this Work, I shall
refer to the fuller Account of their Conduct,
which will appear in its Place.</P>
<Q>Here follows an Account of the Proceedings at
<HI>Torwood.</HI></Q>
<P>The Meeting was in the Fields, at a Place call'd
<HI>Torwood,</HI> in the Western part of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
11th of <HI>September,</HI> 1684 Mr. <HI>Richard Cameron,</HI>
Mr.—and Mr. <HI>Donald Cargil Ministers,</HI>
assisting but Mr. <HI>Cargil</HI> Preached the action Sermon
from 21 <HI>Ezek. 25, 26, 27. And thou prophane
wicked Prince of</HI> Israel, <HI>whose Day is come, when
Iniquity shall have an End: Thus saith the Lord God,
remove the Diadem and take off the Crown, &amp;c.</HI> In
this Preaching, he made first a short Pertinent
Discourse, on the Nature, Subject, Causes, and
Ends of Excommunication, and declared fully
his own Motives then to Pronounce it, and that it
was not from any private Spirit, Malice, or Pas∣sion,
but Conscience of his Duty and Zeal, for
the Honour of God, and of his Church, after
which, he began as follows, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>“We have spoken of Excommunication, the
Causes, Subject, and Ends thereof, we shall
now proceed to the Action it self, being con∣strained
by the Conscience of our Duty, and
Zeal for God, to Excommunicate at this Time,
some of those among us in thse Lands, who
have been guilty of such Crimes, as renders
them the proper Subjects of this Censure, and
especially those who have been Authors of
<PB N="278" REF="377"/>
the present Mischiefs, to the Church of Christ,
in this Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and in doing this, we
shall give them the ordinary Names, by which
they are called, that it may not be in the least
doubtful, who we are speaking of, in so solemn
an Occasion.”</P>
<P>“I Being a Minister of Jesus Christ, and having
Authority and Power from him, do in his Name,
and by his Spirit Excommunicate <HI>CHARLES</HI> II.
King, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that upon the Account of these
wickednesses following. 1. For his high mocking
the Majesty of God in that, where he had
Confest his own Sins, his Fathers Sins, his Mo∣thers
Idolatry, and had Solemnly engag'd against
them in his Declaration, at <HI>Dumferlin, August,</HI>
16. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>650. and was upon that Declaration, and
on the Conditions thereof accepted as King:
He has broken the said solemn Engagement,
and return'd more avowedly to those Sins, than
all that were before him. (2.) For his abhorr'd
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At the Revolution, they charg'd King James with Perjury, in breaking his Coronation Oath, wherein he had Sworn to maintain the Church, and true Religion.</NOTE> Perjury in that, after he had Twice so∣lemnly
subscrib'd the Covenant; he most Pre∣sumptuously
disown'd, and Renounc'd it, cau∣sing
it to be burn'd by the Hangman. (3) For
that he has caused all those<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">At the Revolution, they charg'd him with dispensing with the Laws, and setting up his Arbitrary Will, in the Room of the Law.</NOTE> Laws for esta∣blishing
Religion and Reformation, and which
he had engaged in the said Covenant, to
preserve, to be rescinded; and enacted Laws, di∣rectly
contrary, and is still Working to set up

<HI>Poyery</HI> among us.<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">King James charg'd with setting up <HI>Popery</HI> among us.</NOTE>(4) For Commanding his
Armies<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">King James charg'd with keeping up a standing Army in time of Peace.</NOTE> to destroy the Lords People, who were
standing in their own just Defence, of their

<HI>Things, to render him Obedience, if he had Reigned

of true <HI>Protetants;</HI> a savourers<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">King James charg'd with helping and favouring <HI>Papists.</HI></NOTE> and
helper of the <HI>Papists,</HI> at Home and Abroad,
and hath hindred the due Execution of just
Laws. (6) For his relaxing of the
Kingdom, by his frequent granting Par∣don
to Murtherers, which is expresly contrary
to the Law of God, and therefore not in the
Power of any King to do. (7) His great and
dreadful Uncleaness, Adultery, and Incest his
Drunkenness and Dissimulation, with God and
Man, performing his Promises, where his Engage∣ments
were Sinful, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>“By the same Authority, and in the same
Name, I Excommunicate and Cast out of the
True Church, and deliver up to <HI>Sattan, James</HI>
Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and that for his Idolatry, as far
<PB N="280" REF="379"/>
as concerns <HI>Scotland,</HI> for other Things I read
not; and for setting up Idodatry in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to
defile the Lords Land, and his encouraging and
drawing others to do so.”</P>
<P>“Next in the same Name, and by the same
Authority, I Excommunicate <HI>James</HI> Duke of
<HI>Monmouth, &amp;c.</HI> For his coming into <HI>Scotland,</HI>
upon his Fathers unjust Command, and leading
Armies against the Lords People; they being
constrained to Rise, being Killed in, and for
the Right Worshipping of the true God, and
for his refusing at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> the Ceslation pro∣posed
by Others.”</P>
<P>“Next I do by the same Authority, and in the
same Name, excommunicate, cast out of the
true Church, and deliver up to <HI>Sathan, John</HI> D.
of <HI>Lauderdale,</HI> for his dreadful Blasphemy,
against the great God, especially those horrible
Expressions used by him, to the Prelate of St.
<HI>Andrews,</HI> in Prophanation of the Holy Word
of God, (<HI>viz.) Sit thou at my right Hand,</HI> till I
make thine Enemies thy Footstool: Likewise for his
Atheistical drolling upon the Scriptures of God
in General; scoffing at Religion, and Religious
Persons; his Apostacy from the Covenant and
Reformation, and Persecuting thereof, after he
had been professor and pleader for, and possessor
of the said Covenant, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Likewise for his
Perjury and Murther, in the Case of Mr.<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">He was one of them in the Council, who gave publick Faith to Mr. Mitchel, that his Life should be saved, if he would Confess his fireing a Pistol, at the Bishop of St. Andrews, and Wounding the Bishop of Glasgow; without which Confession they could not have put him to Death; notwithstanding which, they not only did make ue of that Confession to condemn Him to Death, but made Oath before the Justiciary Court upon his Tryal and <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that there was no such publick Faith given.</NOTE>
<HI>James Mitchell;</HI> likewise for his Adulteries, and

Uncleanness, for his Counselling and Assisting
the King, in all his Tyrannies, and endeavou∣ring
to overturn the true Religion; for his o∣penly
Gaming on the Lords Days, and finally
for his usual and ordinary Cursing.”</P>
<P>“Next I do by the same Authority, and in the
same Name, cast out of the true Church, and de∣liver
up to <HI>Sathan, John</HI> Duke of <HI>Rothess, &amp;c.</HI> For
his Perjuries, in the aforesaid Case of Mr.
<HI>Mitchell,</HI> for his Adulteries and Uncleanness,
and openly allotting the Lords Day for the
same. For his openly professing and avowing
his Willingness and Readiness, to set up <HI>Popery</HI>
in this Land, at the King's Command, and for
his Barbarous and Unheard of Cruelty, to
that Worthy Gentleman, <HI>David Hackstoun</HI> of
<HI>Rathillet,</HI> whereof he was the chief Author,
Contriver and Commander; and lastly, for his
ordinary Cursing, Swearing, and Drunkeness.”</P>
<P>“Next, I do by the same Authority, and in
the same Name, Excommunicate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Sir <HI>Geo.
Mackenz,</HI> the King's Advocate, for his Apo∣stacy
in turning to a profligate Conversation,
after he had begun a solemn Profession of
Holiness; for his constant Pleading against,
and Persecuting to Death, the Servants of God,
and alledging and laying to their Charge,
Things which in his Conscience he knew to
be against the Word of God, against Truth,
Reason, and the Laws of this Kingdom: And,
on the other hand, his Pleading for Sorcerers,
Murtherers, and other Criminals, that, by the
Laws of God and Man, ought to have been
put to death; likewise for his Ungodly, Er∣roneous,
Fantastick and Blasphemous Tenets
<PB N="282" REF="381"/>
publish'd to the World in his Pamphlets and
Pasquils.”</P>
<P>“Lastly, I do by the same Authority, and in
the same Name, Excommunicate, <HI>&amp;c. Thomas
Dalziel</HI> of <HI>Bins,</HI> for his Leading Armies, and
Commanding the pillaging, oppressing, and
cruelly murthering the Lord's People; particu∣larly
for his Commanding to shoot at Post—<HI>Finlay,</HI>
an innocent Person, at <HI>New Millus,</HI>
without any Form of Law, Civil or Military,
he not being guilty of any thing which they
themselves counted a Crime; likewise for his
Lewd and Impious Life, led in Adultery and
Uncleanness from his Youth, in a Contempt
of lawful Wedlock, which is the Ordinance of
God; for his Atheistical and Irreligious Life;
and, lastly, for his unjust Taking away and Keep∣ing
Possession of the Estate of that worthy Gen∣tleman
<HI>William Muire</HI> of <HI>Caladol,</HI> and other inju∣rious
Deeds in Exercise of this Power.”</P>
<P>After he had pronounc'd the above Sentences
of Excommuication, he went on to the Purpose
following. “I think, said he, none that acknow∣ledge
the Word of God, the Power deputed
to his Church, and the Reason and Nature
of that Power, can judge this Sentence to be
unjust. The Pretence of its being unformal,
without Warnings, Admonitions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is fully
answer'd, in that those Men have placed them∣selves
above the Admonitions of Ministers,
have repell'd all due Warnings, and wickedly
put to cruel Deaths the Servants and Ministers
of Christ, who have with Freedom and Boldness
adventur'd to give them Warnings and Ad∣monitions,
and shut up all Access from us
that remain to do the like; and as for Proof
of the Fact, I have here charg'd upon them
<PB N="283" REF="382"/>
it needeth not, the Deeds being notour and
known, and the most of them such as them∣selves
do avow, and, to their Shame, boast of.
And <HI>as the Causes are just,</HI> and such as for which
the Ministers of Christ have in all Ages pro∣ceeded
to the like Sentence, SO it being now
done by a Minister of the Gospel, and in such
a Manner as the present Circumstances of the
Church of Christ, with respect to the present
cruel Persecution, will admit, the Sentence
likewise is undoubtedly just also; and there
are no Powers on Earth, either of Kings,
Princes, Magistrates, or Ministers of the
Gospel, can, without the Repentance of the
Persons openly and legally appearing, reverse
these Sentences upon any <HI>such</HI> Account: And
as God, who is the Author of that Power, is
the more engaged to the ratifying these Sen∣tences,
so all that acknowledge the Word of
God, and believe themselves subject to his
Government, ought also to acknowledge them.”</P>
<P>“If any shall object, as we hear they do, that
these Proceedings, tho' not unjust, are foolish
and rigorous: We answer with that Word of
Scripture which we have much more reason
to use than those of whom it is recorded,
<HI>Gen. 34. 31. Should he deal with our Sister as with an
Harlot?</HI> Should they deal with our God as
with an Idol; Should they deal with his Peo∣ple
as with Murtherers and Malefactors; and
shall we not draw out God's Sword against
God's Enemies.”</P>
<P>It is true that this Action was the Execration
and Aversion of those Times, and of the Sove∣reign
that then Reigned, and to their Reproach
it will be Recorded, that two sorts of People
blam'd the <HI>Cameronians for running</HI> that length.
<PB N="284" REF="383"/>
<HI>First,</HI> Their Brethren of the Presbyterian Church,
who temporised at that time, and not thinking
themselves called to bear their Testimony in such
a manner against the Persecutors; or perhaps not
being able to bear the fury of the Prosecution,
consented to receive the liberty of their Wor∣ship
by <HI>the Indulgence</HI> of the King, and the Li∣cense
of the Bishops: And <HI>3dly,</HI> The good Peo∣ple,
as well Dissenters as others in England or
elsewhere; who were Ignorant not only of what
those People sffered, but of the Principles by
which they acted; and who receiving their Infor∣mation
in a Partial, or Imperfect manner from
their Enemies only, or from the other People who
join'd not with them, never rightly understood
their Case; which Ignorance, and consequently
the Prejudices that attended it, remains to this
Day.</P>
<P>As <HI>to the First,</HI> God has been pleased to Con∣vince
most of those People, that their suffering
Brethren were in the Right; and for the Infor∣mation
<HI>of the Second Part,</HI> these Memoirs are
written.</P>
<P>I shall close this Account of Sufferers with
Two or Three remarkable Instances, as well of
Christian Constancy in the Persons Suffering, as
of the Account given by them of the Reason of
their then bearing their Testimony against the
Power that then Ruled: And the First is in the
Death of <HI>Mr. John Nisbet,</HI> who was put to death
at <HI>Edinburgh, Dec.</HI> 4. 1685. the first Year of the
Reign of King <HI>James</HI> VII.</P>
<P>The account of this Gallant spirited Gentle∣man,
as well as couragious Christian, is thus
faithfully abridg'd by one of his near Relations,
who was an Eye Witness to his Sufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="384"/>
“In the Year 1664 he had a Child born, and
refusing to let it be Baptised by the <HI>Parish Cu∣rate,</HI>
or Episcopal Parson, he had it privately
Baptised by one of the outed Ministers. The
Persecution being then but newly begun, and
very little Blood shed on that account: The <HI>Cu∣rate</HI>
enrag'd at this, publish'd in his Pulpit, that
he would Excommunicate Mr. <HI>Nisbet</HI> the next
Lord's day, and had done so, but that the Day
before he was snatch'd away by Death suddenly.
When the Persecuted People in 1666, met to∣gether
at <HI>Lanerk,</HI> and received the Covenant at
<HI>Lanerk,</HI> his Conscience summon'd him to join
with them; and being known, and threatn'd with
Death for that Action, was oblig'd for his own
safety to follow those People, and keep with
them in Arms: At the Fight at <HI>Pentland</HI> he was
sore wounded, stript as Dead, and left among the
Slain, but was preserv'd, and made his escape.”</P>
<P>“At the Insurrection at <HI>Bothwell,</HI> he joyn'd with
the same People again, and fought openly and
<HI>Boldly</HI> at the <HI>Bridge;</HI> being not only a zealous
Christian, but a Man of great Bravery and Re∣solution,
as long as any Man would stand;
and made his retreat and escaped falling
into the Enemies Hands for that time;
but being known was proscrib'd by Pro∣clamation,
and a large Reward offer'd for ap∣prehending
him, his Estate and Goods seiz'd,
his Wife and four Children stript of all, and
turn'd out of Doors.”</P>
<P>“In this Condition he was one of those who are
discrib'd in the <HI>11th Heb. 38. They wandred about
in Desarts and in Mountains, and in Dens and
Caves of the Earth, of whom the World was not
worthy,</HI> and thus he lived, Suffering as we may
say, all kinds of Distress, from the Year 1679
<PB N="286" REF="385"/>
to 1685, above six Years, <HI>not accepting Deliver∣ance,</HI>
that he might preserve to himself the free
enjoyment of the Gospel faithfully Preached in
the Fields and Hills; whether he, and a select
Company, such as he was, came always well
Arm'd, as well to defend themselves, as to Pro∣tect
their Ministers and Bretheren from Vio∣lence
during the Worship of God, as occasion
should present: At length being retired to a
poor Man's House in the Parish of <HI>Tinnick,</HI>
where they had used to be sheltered in severe
Weather, it pleased God that they were seen,
and private Information given, so that before
they were aware the House was surrounded, and
after a very desperate Resistance, in which he
received Seven Wounds, they were all taken.”</P>
<P>“The Lieutenant of Dragoons, who was of his
own Name, yet Insulted him, and Treated him
in a most Barbarous manner: First he took his
three Friends, who were Prisoners with him,
and Shot them Dead before his Face; then com∣ing
to him, asked him <HI>what he thought of himself
now?</HI> He Reply'd, <HI>I think as well of Christ and
his Cause as ever, and not at all the worse for what I
Suffer; and I only Grieve that I am left, and my
dear Brethren are gone to Heaven, whom you have
wickedly Murther'd.</HI> The Bloody Cruel Wretch
Reply'd with an Oath, <HI>he should not be long behind
them, but he reserved him for worse Punishment.</HI>
He Answered, <HI>If the Lord stand by me, and keep
me faithful to Death, I care not what Sufferings I
am put to endure.</HI> The Lieutenant then bound
him Cruelly, tho' bleeding at his Wounds, and
carried him to <HI>Kilmarnock,</HI> and from thence
to <HI>Air,</HI> where by Intercession of Friends, a Sur∣geon
was allow'd to dress his Wounds, after
which he was carried to <HI>Edinburgh.</HI> It seems all
<PB N="287" REF="386"/>
this was done, that the Lieutenant might have
the Reward published for apprehending him,
otherwise he had been Shot with the rest.”</P>
<P>“Being brought to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> he was brought be∣fore
the Bloody Council, where they ask'd him
the Questions following, and received short An∣swers
from him, such as barely shew'd, that he
neither expected or sought any Mercy at their
Hands. The Questions were thus.”</P>
<Q><P><HI>Q. Was you at the Field Conventicle at—?</HI> [Here
they Nam'd the Day and the Place]</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes.</P>
<P>Q. How many Men in Arms had you there?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I went there to hear the Gospel Preach'd,
and not to take an Account of Men or Arms
that might be there.</P>
<P>Q. Which Way went you when the Preaching was done?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The best way we could to escape your Cru∣elty.</P>
<P>Q. Where keep you the General Meetings, and what
do you at them?</P></Q>
<P>To this he Answered he was not obliged to
give an Account; at which one of the Council
pretended he would do it for them, and made a
long Speech of what was done (tho' he gave a
false Account) at a General Meeting near <HI>Edin∣burgh:</HI>
Then they asked the Prisoner <HI>if he was not
there.</HI></P>
<Q><P><HI>A.</HI> No.</P>
<P>Q. We hope you are so much of a Christian as to
Pray for the King.</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Prayer is a holy Ordinance of God, and
we ought to Pray for the King as well as
for others, but not when every Profligate
Commands us.</P>
<P>Q. Do you own the King as Lawful and sole Sove∣raign
Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="387"/>
<HI>A.</HI> He being Papist and that from his Youth,
and a Protestant of the Presbyterian covenanted
Perswasion, I neither can or will own him while
he remain such, if he repents and turns to God,
I shall readily acknowledge him and obey him,
and pray for him.</P></Q>
<P>Upon these answers and without any farther
process, they passed Sentence of Death upon him,
which he receiv'd, <HI>says the relator of this Story,</HI>
not only with Christain Submission, but with
thankfullness, blessing, and praising God, who
had counted him worthy to suffer for his Name:
during the time of his Imprisonment he was
used very cruelly, having a merciless Weight of
Irons upon him during the whole time; yet he de∣clar'd
that he had a constant wonderful inward
Assistance and Support from the Good Spirit of
God, bearing him up under the Cross, having
both a comfortable Assurance of the Pardon of his
Sins, and a full Satisfaction of the Justness of the
Cause in which he suffered.</P>
<P>After this we need but conclude this Work
with an Account of the last Martyr who suffered
in this Cause, and this was a Godly Minister; to
leave it upon Record, that as the first that dyed
was a Minister (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>James Guthrie.</HI> So was
the last also (<HI>viz.</HI>) Mr. <HI>James Renwick.</HI></P>
<P>There is another Observation on the Occasion
of his Death (<HI>viz.</HI>) that he dyed the 17th of <HI>Feb.</HI>
1688, the begiinning of the same Year of the Revo∣lution,
Testifying that the Episcopal Party never
abated or relented; that they were never satiated
with Blood; but went on as long as they had Power,
even till they saw the very Cloud hovering and
the Storm ready to break upon their Heads,
nor had their thirst of Blood been quench'd
to this Day, or as long as their had been a faith∣ful
<PB N="289" REF="388"/>
Mewber of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> left alive,
had their Power lasted; so that it was the End of
their Government put an End to their Persecuti∣ons,
and no Clemency, Pity or Compassion in
them; no such things were so much as named
among them.</P>
<P>This Observation puts me in mind of a brief
Story within the Compass of my own Knowledge,
of a Gentleman who was set upon by a Furious
Mastive Dog: The Gentleman defended himself
with a Sword for some time, but the Mastive after
being very much wounded, got within his point
and fastned on his Arm, the Gentlaman being in
great Distress, and fearing every Moment that he
would quit his Arm and fasten upon his Throat,
had no other way to Master this Great Dog, but
being a large heavy Man, he cast himself flat
down upon the Dog with his other Elbow lying
on the Dogs Breast, and thus with the Weight of
his Body crush'd the Beast to Death, and upon
this he observ'd that as the Dog dyed gradually
under him, so fast and no faster his Teeth loosen'd
in his Arm; his Fury lasted with his Life, and
both ended together.</P>
<P>The whole Story is applicable to the Purpose
in hand: The Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was near worried
by this cruel Creature call'd Prelacy, and very
near she was to being taken by the Throat and
destroy'd. But she fell at last upon the Mastive,
and crush'd him to Death, and as hedyed under her,
his Teeth loosen'd, his bloody Feud abated, and
not one jot faster; the persecuting Rage of <HI>Scots</HI>
Prelacy continued with its Life, died when
it died, and will revive if ever it revives, of
which we shall see some Confirmation in the last
Part of this Work.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="389"/>
Mr. <HI>Renwick</HI> at his Death, hath this remarka∣ble
prophetic Expression, in his last Speech,
<HI>(viz.) Do not fear, that the Lord will cast off Scot∣land,
for he will certainly</HI> return again, <HI>and shew
himself gracious in our Land.</HI> This I quote here,
tho' his last Speech is also added at Large, in the
next Pages: I say, this Prophetick saying I quote
here, because the fulfilling of this Prophesy is
the Subject of the next Part.</P>
<P>In this Persecution, as has been Collected from
the Accounts, both Publick and Private, above
18000 People have suffered the utmost Extreme∣ties,
their Enemies could inflict; of which the
following Particulars are a part, many of which
can be proved even to the very Names of the
Persons, with the Places of their Aboad.]</P>
<P>Have been Banished as Slaves to the <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Plantations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1700</NOTE> besides such as were by or∣der
of Council, at the beginning of the Per∣secution,
ordered on pain of Death, to leave
their Country, which amounted to Eighty
Seven; and besides above 750 banished to
<HI>Sheteland,</HI> to the Isles of <HI>Lewis, Orkney,</HI> and
other remote Places belonging to <HI>Scotland:</HI> Of
these 200 were wilfully, and premeditated∣ly
Murthered, by keeping them under
Hatches 'till they were drowned, when the
Ship was Stranded, and there was time for
them to escape, as is observed already.</P>
<P>800 were Outlaw'd as we call it in
<HI>England,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">800</NOTE> about the time of <HI>Pentland</HI> affair, by
the Order of the High Commission Court,
and five and Fifty eminent Persons were Pan∣nelled,
as the Scots Law Terms it; that
is, were Prosecuted absent, and were Sen∣tenced
<PB N="291" REF="390"/>
to be Executed without farther Pro∣secution,
when they should be taken, as ma∣ny
of them afterwards were; among these
were 10 or 11 Ministers, of which Notice is
taken before, page 165.</P>
<P>It is impossible to give an Account of
those who perished by unjust and tedious
Confinement in Prisons by the Barbarity of
merciless Jaylors, stench of close and hor∣rible
Dungeons and Vaults, want of Con∣veniencies,
crowding 30 or 40 into little,
dark and damp Rooms together, lying on
the Ground, extremity of Cold and Hun∣ger,
weight of Chains, Bolts and Irons, and
the like. Besides this great Numbers by the
unhappy Places, where they were Confin'd,
such as the Castles of <HI>Blackness, Dunnotter,
Inverlochy,</HI> and the Bass, and by innume∣rable
Cruelties, Practised upon them,
in those Places, contracted Diseases, lost the
use of Limbs and Senses, as Sight, Hearing,
Tasting, and some even of their Under∣standings,
but many more of their Lives;
and those who think they have modestly
computed the Number of these, for an ex∣act
Account cannot be had; Tell us, they
amount to above 3600, including the 800,
and the 27 last mentioned.</P>
<P>In the several Actions, which their Per∣secutors
call <HI>Rebellions,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">3600</NOTE> and the Skirmishes
which on those Occasions, as also upon Sur∣prises,
or otherwise have happened; there
has been kill'd in the Field about 560,<NOTE PLACE="marg">560</NOTE> as at
<HI>Pentland, Bothwell, Aird Moss,</HI> Queen Ferry,
and other Places, in defence of their Meet∣ings,
and personal defence of their Lives,
<PB N="291" REF="391"/>
besides those who have dyed of Wounds,
receiv'd on such Occasions, which are rec∣kon'd,
to be about 120.<NOTE PLACE="marg">680</NOTE>
Those that have fled from their Country,
into voluntary Banishment, have been yet a
greater Number: These made their way in∣to
<HI>England, Ireland, Holland, Sweden,</HI> and to
any Place whether Necessity drove them, for
safety of their Lives, and as opportunity of
Escape offered; in which Countries they
were driven to great Distress; such as Want,
Cold and Hunger, having their Lives given
them indeed for a Prey; but being perfectly
destitute of Friends, Shelter, Help or Re∣lief;
other than what God was pleased to
raise them up by his Providence, and by the
Christian Charity of Foreign Protestants.
The Number of these, have been esteemed
by such as think they have made a modest
Calculation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">7000</NOTE> at above 7000.</P>
<P>Of these, that I may do Justice to the
Charity of every Man, and every sort of
Men, the Cruelty they suffered at Home, and
the Extremities they suffered abroad, were
such, as was even detested by Papists them∣selves;
and some of the Suffering People
have acknowledged, they have met with
Compassion, even among the Roman Ca∣tholicks;
who have expressed their Asto∣nishment,
that Protestants should exercise
such Inhumanities upon one another. In <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
also they were often Harboured, Re∣liev'd,
Entertain'd and Concealed, even by
some Charitable People, who were of them∣selves
Episcopal, and Members of the E∣stablish'd
Episcopal Church; but who ab∣hor'd
the Cruelties and Inhumanities of
<PB N="292" REF="392"/>
the <HI>Scots</HI> Persecutors, and even abhorr'd the
Persecution it self.</P>
<P>Of those who went then into voluntary
Banishment, or, as it may be rather said,
fled from the Face of their bloody Persecutors,
very few ever returned again to <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
the Number of Years being such, that
Age, together with the hardship of their
Sufferings, carried most of them off before
the happy time of the Deliverance of their
Country arriv'd.</P>
<P>Besides these, there were abundance of
Innocent and Pious Sufferers, who were
basely Murthred by the Soldiers and Perse∣cutors,
upon the Occasions and by the Me∣thods
of which we have Spoken, being ge∣nerally
kill'd in cold Blood, without Process
of Law, Civil or Military, without visible
Crime, Charge, or Examination: Of those,
the Printed Accounts tell us the Names of
78 Murther'd by particular Persons, and I
am well assur'd there were very many more,
and have hear'd, that a Person, whom I
have not met with, has the Names of above
420 more; but that Number I do not a∣vouch.<NOTE PLACE="marg">498</NOTE></P>
<P>The Number really Executed, in the Pre∣tended
course of Justice, and by the Sen∣tence
of the cruel Persecutors, and who died
by the Hangman, as I am credibly Inform'd,
is very great, and I am told that about 362
are to be found on the several Books of
the Justiciary, and Council Courts, upon Re∣cord,
besides what were Executed by Mili∣tary
Laws,<NOTE PLACE="marg">352</NOTE> as they call them, of which no
Record has been kept.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="393"/>
The Numbers of those who Perished thro' Cold,
Hunger, and other Distresses, Contracted in their
Flight into the Mountains, wandring without
Shelter or Harbour, in dreadful Winters, during
the long space of 28 Years Persecution, and who
often came home in such Extremities, as just to
step into their own Houses to die, and some times
were, even in the Article of Death, dispatch'd
by the Murthering Soldiers: These were many
Thousands, and cannot be Calculated, but will
certainly make up more than the Number of
Eighteen Thousand, mentioned above.</P>
<P>Among these, I say nothing of the Pillage and
Spoil of Goods, the turning Women and Chil∣dren
out into the Fields, in Cold and Nakedness,
after devouring their Food, and tearing off the
Cloaths from their Backs, of which many Pe∣rished
for Want, and by the Extremeties of the
Weather.</P>
<P>It were also endless, to Number the Families
ruined and reduc'd to Misery and Want, which
must be the Consequence of the Plunderings and
Murthers, mentioned above; so that it should be
wondered rather, that any of those People were
left, or that there were any found at the Revolu∣tion;
tho' to the Honour of Truth, it must be
own'd, that at the Revolution, their Number was
found to be greater than ever, Witness their rai∣sing
a Regiment of 800 Men in one Day, without
beat of Drum, for the Guard of the Convention,
and for the Service of their Protestant King; which
Regiment was composed of Men, as serious in
Religion towards God, as Resolute in Arms for
their King and Country, and were Eminent in the
Army for preserving the Worship of God among
them, for which they were call'd in Derision, the
Psalm Singing Regiment. Their Noble Colonel,
<PB N="295" REF="394"/>
the Earl of <HI>Angus,</HI> was kill'd at the Fight at
<HI>Steenkirk,</HI> where the Regiment behav'd with such
Gallantry, that the King himself gave Testimony
of their Bravery, and is still in being in the Army,
having lately given another happy Instance of
their Behaviour at <HI>Preston,</HI> where great Part of
them were Slain, and where, if they had not be∣haved
with an uncommon Resolution, the Rebels
had not been reduced as they were.</P>
<P>All the Account given of those Things are
fil'd with the last Speeches of the dying People,
which the Brevity of these Memoirs does not al∣low,
nor the Design of them make needful. How∣ever,
as I promis'd, <HI>Page</HI> 290. I have clos'd the
Scene with the dying Speech of one Mr. <HI>James
Renwick,</HI> whose Tragedy clos'd the Persecution,
for he was not only the last Minister, bat the
last Man they had Power to put to Death, and it
is as follows.</P>
<P>“Spectators, (or if there be any of you) Auditors,
I must tell you, I am come here
this Day to lay down my Life, for adhering to
the Truths of CHRIST, for which I am nei∣ther
affraid nor asham'd to suffer; Nay, I bless
the LORD, that ever he counted me worthy,
or enabled me to suffer any thing for him; and
I desire to praise his Grace, that he hath not
only kept me free from the gross Pollutions of
the Time; but also from many ordinary Pollu∣tions
of Children; and such as I have been
stain'd with, he hath washed me from them in
his own Blood. I am this Day to lay down my
Life, for these three Things. (1.) For disown∣ing
the Usurpations and Tyranny of <HI>James</HI>
Duke of <HI>York.</HI> (2.) For preaching, That it
was unlawful to pay the <HI>Cess,</HI> expresly exacted
<PB N="194" REF="395"/>
for bearing down the Gospel. (3.) For preach∣ing,
That it was lawful for People to carry
Arms, for desending themselves in their Meet∣ings
for the persecuted Gospel Ordinances. I
think a Testimony for these is worth many
Lives, and if I had Ten hundred, I would think
it little enough to lay them all down for the
same.”</P>
<P>“Dear Friends, Spectators and (if any of you
be) Auditors, I must tell you, That I dye a
<HI>Presbyterian Protestant.</HI> I own the Word of God
as the Rule of Faith and Manners. I own the
<HI>Confession of Faith, Larger and Shorter Catechisms,
Sum of Saving Knowledge,</HI> Directory for Wor∣ship,
&amp;c. Covenants National and Solemn League,
Acts of General <HI>Assemblies,</HI> and all the faithful
Contendings that have been for the Work of
Reformation. I leave my Testimony approving
the Preaching of the Gospel in the Fields, and
the Defending the same by Arms. I adjoyn my
Testimony to all that hath been seal'd by Blood,
shed either on Scaffolds, Fields or Seas, for the
Cause of Christ. I leave my Testimony against
Popery, Prelacy, Erastianism, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Against all
Prophanity, and every thing contrary to sound
Doctrine; particularly against all Usurpations
made upon Christ's <HI>Rights,</HI> who is the PRINCE
OF THE KINGS OF THE EARTH, who
alone must <HI>bear the Glory</HI> of Ruling his own
Kingdom, the Church: And in particular a∣gainst
the <HI>Absolute Power</HI> usurp'd by this Usur∣per,
that belongs to no Mortal, but is the <HI>In∣communicable
Prerogative of JEHOVAH;</HI> and a∣gainst
this <HI>Toleration flowing from that Absolute
Power.”</HI></P>
<P>Upon this he was bid have done; He an∣swer'd,
“I have near done. Then he said, ye
<PB N="295" REF="396"/>
that are the People of GOD, do not weary in
maintaining the <HI>Testimony of the Day,</HI> in your
Sations and Places; And whatever ye do, make
sure of an Interest in Christ; for there is a Storm
coming that shall try your Foundation. <HI>SCOT∣LAND
must be rid</HI> of <HI>SCOTLAND,</HI> before the
Delivery come. And you that are Strangers to
GOD, <HI>break off your Sins by Repentance,</HI> else I will
be a Witness against you, in the Day of the
Lord. Here they caus'd him to desist. Upon
the Scaffold he sung a part of the 103d <HI>Psalm</HI>
from the beginning, and read the 19th Chapter
of the <HI>Revelation:</HI> And having thus finish'd his
Course, ser'd his Generation, and witness'd a
good Confession for his Lord and Master, before
many Witnesses, by the Will of GOD, he
yielded up his Spirit into the Hands of GOD
who gave it.”</P>
<P>“Being the last that seal'd the Testimony of
this suffering Period in a publick Way upon a
Scaffold.”</P>

<HEAD>THE
CHURCH
IN HER
PRESENT STATE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>e are now happily come to the
End of this melancholly Part, and
the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> having now
gone thro' a long Series of Trou∣ble
and Affiction, began to see a
glimpse of that glorious Delive∣rance
which was approaching: The Tyrannick and
illegal Attempts upon the Religion and Liberties
of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, as well as of the <HI>Scots,</HI>
began to stir up that Nation to think of pre∣serving
themselves from Destruction; and having
apply'd themselves to the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> for
Assistance, that glorious Person began to listen
to their Proposal, and to make Preparations for
his coming into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="398"/>
In the Deliverance that follow'd, the Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> found her Deliverance also: For in the
Death of Civil Tyranny, Christian Liberty re∣vivd.</P>
<P>The History of the coming of the Prince of
<HI>Orange</HI> to the <HI>English</HI> Throne, is perfectly and
fully related in so many Histories, is recent in
the Memory of all People at the writing hereof,
and probably will still be on so many subsequent
Occasions preserv'd to Posterity, that as it
does not immediately relate to our present Me∣moirs:
So also I need not enter upon an Account
of it here, other than what is absolutely Neces∣sary
to the Story I am relating.</P>
<P>It is also well known, that this Glorious Prince
having finish'd the Deliverance of the <HI>English</HI>
Nation, resolv'd the same should extend to <HI>Scot∣land;</HI>
and that <HI>as it is express'd in his Declaration,</HI>
Religion should be settl'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in such a
manner as was most agreeable to the Inclinations
of the People; from whence, and in the Conse∣quence
of which, we shall soon see many usful
Observations most naturally drawn, pertinent to
the Case now before us; and which, I see, all
have great Occasion to make mention of again in
the Process of these Memoirs.</P>
<P>1. But AS <HI>it has been already made plain</HI> in the
first Part of these Memoirs, that the beginning
of the Reformation in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the first Re∣formers
of <HI>Scotland</HI> were <HI>Presbyterian,</HI> and that
Episcopacy sprung up there but from the Dege∣neracy
of the Reformation: SO it will now, <HI>that</HI>
the Inclination of the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> Ran with
an irresistible Torrent into <HI>Presbyterianism</HI> a∣gain
at the Revolution, as it had always done
when it was left in the Choice of the People;
<PB N="299" REF="399"/>
and that as at the Revolution aforesaid, it was lest
to the Nation by the <HI>Prince of Orange,</HI> to settle
Religion in such manner as was most desir'd by
the People, not <HI>a Dog wag'd his Tongue</HI> against the
<HI>Presbyterian</HI> Establishment, <HI>not a Mouth gave a
Vote</HI> for <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> nor was it so much as nam'd
to the King as a Question, whether the Incli∣nation
of the People was for <HI>Episcopacy</HI> or <HI>Pres∣bytery;</HI>
insomuch, that the King was often heard
to say afterwards, that he wonder'd much what
was become of the Episcopal Party, seeing no
Man at the Revolution so much as nam'd the
Word Episcopacy to him, nor had the Party any
one to speak for them, or one Word to speak for
themselves.</P>
<P>How they could, since that, have the Face to
say, <HI>especially as they often did to the late Queen,</HI>
that they were superior in Number to the <HI>Pres∣byterians;</HI>
and that if the People of <HI>Scotland</HI> were
left free to Vote, they would carry it for Epis∣copacy,
<HI>I say,</HI> how they could say thus, would
be strange to any that did not know how that
Party have, on all Occasions, made such Things
<HI>their Refuge,</HI> and the Refuge of their Prelatick
Hierarchy; and the Author of these Memoirs is
Thankful, that even at the Time they did so, he
had the Honour in behalf of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
to let her Late Majesty know how untrue
that Suggestion was, and to Convince her Mini∣stry
how grosly those Men endeavour'd to impose
upon <HI>England</HI> in that Case, as they did at the
same Time in their Boast of the People receiving
the <HI>English</HI> Service Book with willingness in <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
which Her Majesty was afterwards fully
satisfy'd was a Cheat, and done only to amuse the
<HI>English</HI> Clergy, and get Money of them.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="400"/>
2. It is observable in the Revolution, that the
People of <HI>Scotland</HI> came all into the Principles of
the suffering sincere Party, the suffering Party kept
their own footing, and did not go over to them;
those that had thro' Fear, or from Time-serving
Principles, or for want of Zeal, or for any other
weak Reason consented, and, <HI>as I may call it,</HI>
taken so low a Step, as to accept of Licenses
from God's Enemies to serve Christ; asking leave
of Men to Worship God; a Duty and Debt which
they had a Natural and Divine Right to, without
bowing the Knee to <HI>Baal</HI> for it; I say, THESE,
far from justifying or recommending the Practice,
openly recogniz'd the Zeal, Courage and Sin∣cerity
of the Sufferers, honour'd them for it, and
rather desir'd to bury their own Compliances in
Silence and Forgetfulness, than to have it menti∣on'd
or remember'd.</P>
<P>3. Now it was seen, and made plain to the
World, that the suffering People in <HI>Scotland</HI> acted
upon no Principles of Enthusiasm, blind Zeal
or religious Frenzy, <HI>as their Enemies suggested;</HI>
that they were no Enemies to Monarchy, Civil
Government, order of Society, and the like, <HI>as
had been scandalously said;</HI> but that they kept strict∣ly
to the Rule of God's Word, adher'd to an
honest Cause, and acted upon just Principles:
And when such Kings were call'd to the Throne,
as desir'd to Rule for God, and the Good of the
People, who made the Laws of God and Man
<HI>the Rule</HI> of their Government, and the Prosperity
of Religion, and of their Subjects <HI>the End of it;</HI>
they knew how to obey, serve and defend such
Princes with their Blood and Treasure, as well
as they had Courage to resist and reject those,
who, with the Breach of Faith, Honour or Con∣stitution,
became Tyrants and Persecutors, Ene∣mies
<PB N="301" REF="401"/>
<HI>mies</HI> to God, and Destroyers of Men, as their
former Princes had been.</P>
<P>This is evident by their Practice, at the Re∣volution;
in that no sooner was the <HI>Prince</HI> of
<HI>Orange</HI> Landed in <HI>England,</HI> and the Enemies of
our Constitution began to stagger, but these Peo∣ple
immediately took Arms, and successfully
chas'd <HI>the bloody Party,</HI> out of their Country.
But when this was done, <HI>what Measures did they
take?</HI> Did they run into any Enthusiasm? Did
they set up KING JESUS as a Temporal Prince,
and the fifth Monarchy in his Name? Did they
Preach the Doctrine of <HI>Dominion founded on Grace,</HI>
or form Schemes of Republican Government?
Did they erect themselves as Tyrants in the Room
of those they pull'd down, so making the Peo∣ple
change their Masters, not their Yoke? NO,
NO, they adher'd to the Legal Constitution of
their Country, they submitted chearfully to the
Return of Magistracy, and the free Course of the
Laws, of their Country, they arm'd themselves,
and came up to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> at their own Charge,
form'd themselves into Companies; <HI>indeed, they
were able to have form'd a considerable Army,</HI> and
offer'd themselves to March to any Part of the
Nation against the Popish and Jacobite Party;
and especially they offer'd, and were accepted,
and admitted to Guard the <HI>Convention of Estates,</HI>
against the Attempt of the Duke of <HI>Gordon,</HI> who
at that Time commanded a Popish Garison in the
Castle of <HI>Edinburgh;</HI> and against all, of any De∣nomination
that should attempt to Disturb them;
and to the eternal Honour of the wild Antimo∣narchical,
Enthusiastick, Lunatick <HI>Cameronians,
for so their Enemies had call'd them;</HI> they were the
first Men in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that address'd or petition'd
<PB N="302" REF="402"/>
the Convention of Estates, to Place the Crown of
<HI>Scotland</HI> on the Head of their Deliverer King
<HI>WILLIAM,</HI> which was done accordingly; to
the restoring of Religion, healing the Breaches
of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and the utter Confusion of their per∣secutors,
of whom I shall have more to say pre∣sently.</P>
<P>I cannot give a better Account of this, than in
their own Words: First, of their Declaration,
or Memorial of their Grievances, and then their
Petition itself: At the End of the said Memo∣rial
of Grievances, we have them concluding
thus, the Repetition of which will appear very
Pertinent to the Case in Hand (<HI>viz.</HI>) to prove
their willing adhering to Legal and Religious Go∣vernors
and Government, their Words are these,
(<HI>viz.</HI>) “We are represented by our Enemies as
Antipods to all Mankind, Enemies to Govern∣ment,
and incapable of Order; But as their
Order and Cause is, <HI>Toto Diametro,</HI> opposite to
the institutions, and Cause of Christ; so they
must have little Wit:, and lefs Honesty, who
believe and receive those Notions, and the Re∣proaches
of those, who were as great Rebels and
Enemies to the present Government, as we a∣vow'd
ourselves, to be to the last: Our Suffer∣ings
for declining the Yoke of Tyranny, and
Popish Usurpation, are already hinted, and
are generally known; and all that will examine,
and consider our Conduct, since the King began
his heroick Undertaking, to redeem these Na∣tions
from Popery and Slavery, will be forc'd
to acknowledge, that we have given as good
Evidence of our being <HI>willing to be Subject</HI> to
King <HI>William,</HI> as we gave before of our being <HI>un∣willing
to be Slaves</HI> to King <HI>James:</HI> Upon the
firt Report of the Prince of <HI>Orange's</HI> Expedi∣tion,
<PB N="303" REF="403"/>
we own'd his Quarrel, even while the

<P>From this Time forward till the Union, we
scarce ever heard of the <HI>Cameronians:</HI> Their Sepa∣ration
before was evident from just Reasons, their
not complying with indul'ed Liberty, accepting
that from their Enemies which was their Native
Right, and by which they must recognize the
Right and Superiority of Episcopal Jurisdiction,
which they abhor'd, this was all founded on
Conscience and in just Exceptions: But when up∣on
the Revolution, and upon King <HI>William</HI>'s esta∣blishing
their antient Liberty, and that Episco∣pacy was depos'd,
as we shall see presently: They
appeared to be all one united Body of Presbyteri∣ans,
one Church, under one Religious Govern∣ment
and Administration; the same in Opinion,
the same in Doctrine, Discipline, Worship, and
Government, having fewer Breaches, fewer Di∣visions,
fewer fallings off to a differing Opinion,
than any Protestant Church in the World.</P>
<P>It remains then that our Memoirs give a brief
Account of the Restoration of the Church upon
this great Turn of Affairs, and this shall be done
so concisely, and with such regard to what has
been made public already on other Occasions, that
I hope none shall think their Time lost in looking
back, or think the Relation a vain Repetition.</P>
<P>According to the Prayer of the above Petition,
King <HI>William</HI> was declared King of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the
Crown was tendred to him, and accepted by him
in Form, in Conjunction with Queen <HI>Mary.</HI> The
Act of Tender, the Claim of Right, the King's
Acceptance, with his Majesty's Letter to the
<PB N="309" REF="409"/>
Meeting of Estates concerning his accepting the
Crown, and the remarkable Oaths taken by the King
and Queen on that Occasion, are all to be found
in the Collection of Public Acts of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Vol. 3.
P. 147, 153, 156, 159, 187. As soon as these
Things were done, the Convention of Estates were
turned into a Parliament, and from thence forward
began to Act as the Public Legislature of the Nati∣on.
I say no more of the Particulars, because
they are to be found in all the Histories of that
Time: But it is to our present Purpose to Note,
that therewith <HI>Persecution</HI> entirely ceased, <HI>Episcopacy</HI>
sunko into its Primitive State of Obscurity, <HI>the
Persecutors</HI> fled on all Hands from Justice; <HI>The ba∣nish'd,</HI>
and proscrib'd, such as were left alive re∣turned
to their Families, Friends and Native
Country. Religion now began to hold up its
Head, the Godly persecuted Ministers and People
shewed their Faces, and possess'd the Seat of their
Enemies.</P>
<P>The first Act of Parliament (after that for turn∣ing
the Convention into a Parliament, and ano∣ther
to recognize the King's Authority,) was the
Act for abolishing Episcopacy: This makes it
abundantly clear, that the general Bent and Incli∣nation
of the People was for Presbytery, and that
Episcopacy was their Aversion, for that the very
first Act after constituting the Civil Government,
was this of abolishing the Ecclesiastick Govern∣ment
I say the first, because as there were but
two Acts which past before it, one for turn∣ing
the Meeting into a Parliament, the other for
recognizing the King's Authority; 'tis evident
without these they could not have acted at all,
and therefore the Act for abolishing Prelacy may
be said to be the first Act they made, after the
Power of acting was confirmed.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="410"/>
The Act for abolishing Prelacy is very remark∣able,
and can not be omitted without manifest De∣fect
in our Work, it is as follows.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ACT abolishing PRELACY.
July 22d 1689.</HEAD>
<P>“WHereas the Estates of this Kingdom in
their Claim of Right or the 11th of <HI>April</HI>
last declared that Prelacy, and the Superiority
of any Office in the Church, about Presbyters, is
and hath been a great and insupportable Grie∣vance
Nation, and contrary to the Incli∣nation
of the generality of the People ever
since the Reformation; they having reform'd
from Popery by Presbyters, and therefore ought
to be abolished. OUR SOVEREIGN LORD
and LADY the King and Queens Majesty, with
Advice and Consent of the Estates of Parlia∣ment,
do hereby <HI>abolish Prelacy</HI> and all Superio∣rity
of any Office in. the Church of this King∣dom
above Presbyters; and hereby rescinds
Cases, and annulls the 1 Act, 2 Sess. the first
Parl. <HI>Cha.</HI> II. and the 2 Act, 3d Sess. ist Parl.
<HI>Cha.</HI> II. and the 4th Act, 3d Parl. <HI>Cha.</HI> II. and
all other Acts, Statutes and Constitutions in so
far allanerly, as they are inconsistent with this
Act, and do abolish Prelacy, or the Superiority
of Church Officers above Presbyters; and do de∣clare,
that they with the Advice and Consent
of the Estates of this Parliament, will settle by
Law that Church Government in this Kingdom,
which is most agreeable to the Inclinations of
the People.”</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="411"/>
This was a short Session, the Meeting requi∣ring
nothing of publick Business at that Time but
those three Necessary Acts: They met again in
<HI>April,</HI> and then the second Act pass'd, was to do
Justice to the poor persecuted suffering Mini∣sters,
who had been driven out by the Fury of
the late Times; By this Act all the Ministers who
had been so driven away, or as the Law expresses,
it <HI>Thrust from their Churches,</HI> from the 1st of <HI>Jan.</HI>
1661▪ to that Time should be forthwith admit∣ted
and allow'd free Access to their Churches,
from which they were so Thrust out; that so
they might presently Exercise their Ministry in
their several <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arishes without any new Call, and
the present Incumbents are order'd to give Place
to them, and remove themselves.</P>
<P>This was not Persecution, <HI>as some would have
stil'd it,</HI> but restoring the persecuted, and re∣moving
Intruders, for they were no other; and
this was previous to any Church Settlement, be∣cause
it was no more than putting the injur'd
Men into Possession of their Legal Right: All this
while Episcopacy held its Possession in general,
tho' its Government was dissolv'd.</P>
<P>But the fifth Act of the same Session of Parlia∣ment
laid the Ax to the Root of the Tree; this
was that famous Act, entitul'd, <HI>For ratifying the Confession
of Faith, and settling Presbyterian Church
Government;</HI> the Law itself is too long to be re∣printed
here, it is to be found in the Collection
of Acts, <HI>Vol. 3. Page</HI> 206. to 234.</P>
<P>As the Government of the Church was now
restor'd, so were her Judicatories of Course; and
at this Time began the first free General Assem∣bly,
which for eight and twenty Years had not been
seen in <HI>Scotland;</HI> it is needless here to enter into
the detail of the Acts of Assembly, which are
<PB N="312" REF="412"/>
all to be found in the Registers of the Church;
'tis enough to our Purpose to Record, that now
the Church was restor'd to the full and free Ex∣ercise
of her Just and Legal Authority, the Judi∣catures
were erected in their proper Places, such
as Kirk Sessions, Presbytery, Synod, and Assem∣bly,
and all Ecclesiastical Justice ran in its pro∣per
Channel.</P>
<P>Before I go on to what has since happen'd, in
Consequence of this Revolution in the Church, it
will be necessary to say something here to that
Challenge, which some have been very forward
to bring against the Church, of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as if she
were also of persecuting Principles, and had exer∣cised
the same Coertion in point of Conscience
in her Turn, which she had condemn'd in others;
this they have carried on even to the Charge of
Cruelty and Persecution in the Treatment and U∣sage
of the Episcopal Ministers who were dispos∣sess'd
by those Two Acts, <HI>viz. Of abolishing Prela∣cy,
and settling Presbyterian Church Government.</HI></P>
<P>This Charge consists of Two Parts, in clearing
up both which, the Honour and Character of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> will not only be vindicated,
but the Injustice and indeed the Ingratitude of the
Episcopal People, who have brought this Charge,
will very much appear; and a quite contrary Be∣haviour
will be made out to have been the Pra∣ctice
of the present Government.</P>
<Q><P>1. The first Respects the Conduct of the
People, when they took up Arms in a tu∣multuous
Manner at the Beginning of the
Revolution.</P>
<P>2. The next Respects the judicial Proceedings
against the Episcopal Party since, in both
<PB N="313" REF="413"/>
which, there needs no more for the Vin∣dication
of the Church, than that the
Truth of Fact should be impartially sta∣ted.</P></Q>
<P>As to the first it is true, That as soon as the
News came to <HI>Scotland</HI> that the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI>
was landed, with an Army in <HI>England,</HI> and that
King <HI>James</HI> was not able to maintain his Ground
the People of <HI>England</HI> enclining to a general Re∣volt:
The People in the West of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
they were the first, ran immediately to Arms,
and declared for the Prince of <HI>Orange:</HI> This was
done with so Universal a Resolution, and the
Consternation the other People were in at the Ge∣neral
Face of Things, was such at the same Time,
that there was no Capacity, or even Disposition
to oppose them.</P>
<P>In this general Defection from the Government,
the Western People not only took Arms, as is
said; but ran in a Tumultuous manner, first upon
the Church Affairs, for there it was that the Op∣pressions
of the former Times had been most sen∣sibly
felt: In this first Fury it cannot be won∣dered
that they dispossess'd the Episcopal Mini∣sters
(Curates, as they call'd them) of their Churches,
and restoring the old Worship, caused their own
banish'd persecuted Ministers to come and preach
among them: But the Nature of all such Rabbles
consider'd, and above all the Sufferings and Provo∣cation
of those poor People, and of which I have
given some Account; being duly weigh'd, it must
be confess'd to be wonderful, that any kind of
Violence was forborn, not that I allow it was
just to have committed them; but how could
less have been expected from a People so treated
<PB N="314" REF="414"/>
as they had been when, they were thus perfectly
let loose to thier own Resentments.</P>
<P>Yet we do not find that the utmost Violence
complained of, amounts to any more than an over
hasty turning the said Episcopal Ministers out of
the Parsonage Houses, which it was their Opinion
were unlawfully possess'd, and some injurious hur∣rying
their Goods out with them; and this but to
a few: But as to any personal Injury, such as
wounding or killing of any, I do not find that any
such Thing is charged upon them.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, when we reflect, how ma∣ny
must be among those Rabbles who had suffered
deeply in the Persecution, I have spoken of; who
had lost Fathers, Mothers, Children, Husbands,
Wives, and the dearest of remoter Relations in
that Persecution, and could not be without the
warmest Resentment; add to this, that some of
those Ministers or Curates, who they were then
dispossessing, had dipt their Hands too much in the
Persecution of those poor Sufferers: I say, if these
things were duly con<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ider'd, what can be said, but
that it was next to miraculous, that an ungovern'd
Multitude, left to the full Vent of their own Rage;
and that Rage grounded upon such just Provocati∣ons
should have left any of them alive and I can
not think it any Breach of Charity to say, its
very probable had the Parties been chang'd, it
would have been quite otherwise.</P>
<P>And tho' any tumultuous Violences are not
justifiable in a civiliz'd Christian Nation, yet the
the Conduct of these People at that Time, with
their Provocations and Circumstances consider'd, is
a great Testimony of the Moderation of the Pres∣byterians
in <HI>Scotland:</HI> The Scripture makes this an
extraordinary Case, 1 <HI>Sam. 24. 19. If a Man find
<PB N="315" REF="415"/>
his Enemy, will he let him go well away:</HI> yet when
the Presbyterian People in <HI>Scotland</HI> had their Ene∣my
in their Hands, for so at this Time they had,
they left their Revenge to him <HI>to whom Vengeance
belongs;</HI> and contenting themselves with putting it
out of the Power of their Enemies to do any more
Mischief for the Time to come, they meddled
not with punishing them for what was past.</P>
<P>But supposing those Rabbles did commit some
Violences, as to Plunder, and as to Personal Rud∣ness
to the Ministers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who they turned out,
which yet I have not met with any Account of:
This is fully answered in a Book formerly written
on that Subject, in these Words.</P>
<P><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Presbyserian Persecution, p. 9. 10.</NOTE> “What's this to the Church? It might be
done by Presbyterians <HI>of the Church;</HI> but it can never
be said, it was ever done by <HI>THE PRESBYTE∣RIANS
as a Church:</HI> It was done by no Act of
the Church, no, nor of the Government; nor
did either the Church or the Government ever
Approve, Justify, or Employ any of the Per∣sons—
'Tis true, there was no publick pu∣nishing
the Actors; neither did the Govern∣ment
in <HI>England</HI> punish, neither was it a Time
to punish those Excesses: And particularly the
Government in <HI>England</HI> thought fit, by Parlia∣ment,
so far to bear with them, as to stop all
Process against Trespasses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>”</P>
<P>“There is also another unhappy Circumstance,
that so effectually clears the Church of this
Charge, that I cannot but wonder, the Party
could ever make use of it as an Argument, or
bring this Matter of Rabbling into the Charge;
<PB N="316" REF="416"/>
And that is, That these Tumults, Plunderings,
And Driving away the Episcopal Ministers, were
all done and over, before there was any such
thing as a Presbyterian Church; I mean, esta∣blish'd,
or in any Power to Act as a Judicatory,
or as a Body; So that, to charge the Church
with this, is like Indicting a Man for a Mur∣der
committed before he was born.”</P>
<P>This I think may serve to clear up the first
Head, <HI>viz.</HI> the Conduct of the Rabble, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I come next to the general Proceedings of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> as a Church after their
Restoration, or new Establishment: How they were
settled by Act of Parliament, has been already
observ'd; it remains to enquire how they acted
when settled, and whether either the Civil Govern∣ment
or Church Government, can be justly char∣ged
with Persecution.</P>
<P>“It could not be expected, but that, upon the
Revolution, the Prelatic Tyranny would fall
with the Regal; And, were it worth Examin∣ing
into, it would be easy to prove, there was
an inevitable Necessity it should do so, they
being so effectually supported one by another,
that they could not but stand and fall together.”</P>
<P>“That the conjunct Tyranny of both Church
and State had treated the Presbyterians with
such an Impolitic Fury, as must imply, they had
not the least Apprehension of being ever pull'd
down again by them, is very evident from the pa∣ticulars,
which make up the former Part of these
Memoirs. But to return to the History.”</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="417"/>
The Bishops being Deposed, and the Presbyte∣rian
Government and Discipline restored in the
Church: The first thing the Assembly went upon
was, to consider of planting Ministers in the Va∣cant
Churches; for it could, not be, but that in
Eight and Twenty Years of Cruelty and Blood
which they had suffered under, and which I have
given some Account of in these Memoirs, a great
Number of the ancient Ministers were fallen; be∣sides
that, even the length of Time, would by the
Course of Nature carry a great many off the Stage.
<HI>And so it was,</HI> even to such a Degree, that it was
at first not very easy to find Ministers to supply
Churches from which, the Episcopal Ministers or
Curates were necessarily to be removed.</P>
<P>And here again the pretence of Persecution is
brought as a Plea against the displacing those In∣cumbents,
who would not quality themselves ac∣cording
to Law: But neither will it hold in this
Case neither; See the Words of the same Author,
upon the same Subject, where he gives the follow∣ing
brief History of the first Step taken in this
Case.</P>
<P>The Government, says he, was no sooner esta∣blish'd
by the Revolution, and the Kirk restor'd to
her Judicatorial Authority but her several Courts,
as Session, Presbytery, Synod and Assembly, took
their Courses, and began to Act.</P>
<P>By the first Act of Parliament for settling these
Matters, past <HI>June</HI> 7. 1690. Intituled, <HI>Act Ratify∣ing
the Confession of Faith, And Settling Presbyterin
Church Government;</HI> It is ordain'd, <HI>That the General
Assembly the Minister and Elders, should have
Power to try and purge out al Insufficient, Scandelous,
<PB N="318" REF="418"/>
and Erroneous Ministers, by due Course of Ecclesiati∣cal
Process and Censures:</HI> But this Act no where Im∣power'd
them to Censure any who were not In∣sufficient,
Scandalous, or Erroneous, tho' they
would not take the Oaths to the Government—
So that, by this Law, the Church could not be
capable of Persecution.</P>
<P>It may be objected here, That to be Episcopal,
might beadjudged Erroneous by this Judicatory, and
so come under the Church Censure, by Authority
of this Act.</P>
<P>To this 'tis replied—, First, <HI>In Fact,</HI> No Man
was ever since the Revolution Deposed by the
Church, meerly for being Episcopal, nor was any
Process ever commenc'd against any Man on that
Foundation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It was particularly declared by the
First General Assembly after the Revolution, <HI>viz.</HI>
in the Sixth Session, in the Year 1690, <HI>That this
Assembly will Depose no Incumbents simply for their
Judgment anent the Government of the Church, and
Ʋrge Re-ordination upon them. Vide Index</HI> of the
Unprinted Acts of the Assembly, <HI>Sess</HI> 6, 1690.</P>
<P>In the same Assembly, in their Instructions gi∣ven
to their Commission, which was to sit during
their Recess, we have these Words;</P>
<P>That they be very Cautious of receiving Information,
against the late Conformists; And that they proceed in
the Matter of Censure very Deliberately, so as none
may have just Cause to complain of their Rigidity; And
that the shall not proceed to Censure, but upon relevant
Libels and sufficient Probation, <HI>Act 15th, Sess. 26th,
Assembly</HI> 1690.</P>
<P>Again, lest the Presbyterians should be rash and
severe the Commission is impower'd as follows,
<HI>That if they shall be inform'd of any precipitant Proce∣dure
<PB N="319" REF="419"/>
of the Presbyterians in such Processes, to restrain
them, Vide the same Act as above.</HI></P>
<P>If then they were thus Moderate even in Scan∣dalous
Things, and declared against proceeding in
Cases meerly Eyiscopal, where shall we find the
Article of Persecution?</P>
<P>'Tis true, That in the Year 1693, an Act of
Parliament was made to Deprive all such Mini∣sters,
as would not both Swear to the Govern∣ment,
and Acknowledge the Church Government
also, and the Confession of Faith—. But the
Occasion of this Act is visible to all that know
the Affairs of that Time, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was past
to satisfy the Minds of the People, who were ex∣ceedingly
disturb'd at the Churches having been
Insulted in the Assembly 1692, by a general <HI>For∣mula</HI>
procured by the Episcopal Clergy, together
with their Appeal to the King on a Refusal: And
the Assembly being abruptly Dissolved, or Dis∣missed
<HI>sine die,</HI> which put the Nation into a very
great Ferment.</P>
<P>Yet, even upon this Act, I may challenge the
Episcopal Clergy to show me one Minister, that
ever was Deposed for not acknowledging the
Church, if at the same Time he offered to ac∣knowledge
the Government, and take the Oaths,
and they have been often challenged on this Head.</P>
<P>And to confirm this Lenity of Practice by a
Law, that famous Act of Parliament was made in
the Year 1695, wherein taking the Oaths to the
Government is made the <HI>Onely</HI> and <HI>Fully Sufficient</HI>
Qualification, and all Ministers that would so <HI>Qua∣lifie
themselves</HI> are continued. As may be seen at
large by the Act, Intituled, <HI>Act concerning the
Church, Anno</HI> 1695.</P>

This very Act of Parliament, if I were to go
no further, effectually clears the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
from the Charge of Persecution; since 'tis
plain there was no religious Tenet in dispute, but
a civil Question of owning or not owning the Go∣vrenment.</P>
<P>It was by this Act of Parliament taken quite out
of the Power of the Church, to Depose any Man
meerly for being Episcopal in Principle, or for
refusing to own the Presbyterian Church; nay,
the Episcopal Clergy, who by vertue of this Act,
remain in their Livings, many of them to this
Day, refuse to acknowlege the Church, to submit
to any of her Judicatories, or to join, either in
Discipline or Worship.</P>
<P>How impossible it is then to be true, that the
Presbyterian Church has been guilty of Persecuti∣on,
I leave to any Impartial Reader to judge; ad∣ding
withal, what was published in the same Case,
<HI>viz.</HI> That there was at the Time of the Union
One hundred and sixty five Episcopal Ministers then
possessing Churches and Stipends in <HI>Scotland</HI> by the
Lenity and Forbearance of the Government, who
had no other Qualification required of them, than
the taking the Oaths to the Government, and
were not bound to, neither did they comply with,
or submit to the Presbyterian Church; and a List
of their Names has been published, and of the
the Parishes in which they Reside; nay, in several
Parishes where these Episcopal Ministers are In∣cumbent,
the Presbyterians are at the Expence to
have a Minister of their own, who they maintain,
and who Preaches in a Meeting House at their own
private Expence: Take the Case in the Words for∣merly
publish'd thus.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="423"/>
It would be pleasant for People who charge the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> with persecuting the Episcopal
Clergy, to go to some of these Paroches and see
this uncouth Jest, where the persecuting establish∣ed
Church is fain to submit to a Meeting-House,
and the persecuted Episcopal Clergy-man insults
them from the Parish Church, and keeps both the
Pulpit and the Stipend in spight of them all—
Here is the establish'd Church turn'd Dissenter,
and the Dissenter made the Incumbent, the Per∣secutor
become persecuted, and <HI>per contra</HI> the per∣secuted
made the Persecutor.</P>
<P>Thus the Church has re-obtain'd her Establish∣ment,
and here she may be said to be arrived at
the full extant of her Militant State, flourishing
in Peace, and the Wounds of her afflicted State
healing apace.</P>
<P>It remains as a proper Close to this Work, that
something should be said concerning this despised
persecuted Church in General, a Body of Chri∣stians
placed thus, as it were in the remotest part
of the World, in whom however God has been
pleased so eminently to appear, and for whom to
do such great Things as has been here related.</P>
<P>Now she enjoy'd her full Establishment, I mean
just before the Union: After the <HI>Ʋnion,</HI> Attempt
that Episcopacy could make upon her could over∣throw
her Settlement, without overthrowing at
the same Time the whole Constitution of <HI>Great
Britain.</HI> What Attempts have been made upon
her during the Interest which her Enemies had in
the Administration, at the latter End of the last
Reign, have rather scratch'd her Face, than touch'd
her Vitals, and have rather shewed their Design
than their Power: Whether she will obtain that
<PB N="322" REF="424"/>
Justice to have those Injuries redress'd now the
whole Government is restor'd, I cannot yet say,
nor does it relate to the present part of this
Work.</P>
<P>Her Government, Discipline and Worship, are
establish'd now by Treaty, and have the Assent of
an Episcopal Church and Nation as a Sanction to
it: The Act for her Security is Incorporated into,
and made a part of the Act of Union; and the
establishing the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is there called
the establishing the true Protestant Religion.</P>
<P>I know but Two Things which the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> can be said to complain of, or to ask more
than was at this Time granted to her; and those
there is some Reason to fear she never will obtain,
but as they are not Essential to Religion it self, I
shall not lay too great a stress upon them.</P>
<P>1. That the Revenues of the Church, I mean
of the Archbishops, and Bishops, Deans, Chapters,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> when they were Deposed, and Episcopacy
Abolished, were not appropriated to the Uses of
the Church, as indeed they ought to have been,
but divided like the Spoil of the Revolution among
the Nobility and Gentry: Had this been done,
there had been a Fund for the Service of the
Church, which would have been sufficient to have
answer'd several Wants, which in Default of this
Supply, she feels the Effects of, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>1. There had been a Supply for supporting
Students in the Colleges for the Study of
Divinity, and to have enlarged the Sti∣pends
of the Regents or Tutors in the said
Colleges, which were at that Time very
low; and not suitable to the Labour and
Application requisite in those, Offices: The
latter was so evident, that the late Queen
<PB N="323" REF="425"/>
was pleased to add considerably out of her
own Purse, as an encrease of Sallery amount∣ing
in the whole. as I have heard, to
about 300 <HI>l.per Annum.</HI></P>
<P>2. There had been a Fund to encrease the
Stipends of Ministers in remote Parishes,
where they were too small, to encourage
the Incumbents and support their Familes
in waiting upon their Work.</P>
<P>3. There would have been a Fund to have
bred up Ministers to act as Misionaries for
the <HI>Highlands,</HI> to study the <HI>Irish</HI> Language,
and qualify themselves to go into the re∣motest
Parts to Instruct the poor Ignorant
Families of the <HI>Highlanders,</HI> and to support
them in such a Work: A Thing attempt∣ed
since the Union, by a General Subscrip∣tion
for the <HI>Propagating Christian Knowledge,</HI>
but I do not find the Success answers the
Goodness of the Design.</P>
<P>4. There would have been a Fund to have an∣swered
the common Incidents of the
Church, such as sending up Ministers to
<HI>London</HI> to solicit Redress of Grievances,
upon any Occasion, and for every pub∣lick
Transaction with the Court. OR
<HI>which were very desirable</HI> for the maintain∣ing
an Agent constantly at <HI>London,</HI> to take
care of their Interests, to present their
Addresses, recommend their Concerns, and
in a Word to manage their Affairs; all
which they are now obliged either to
want Assistance in, or the Ministers <HI>who do
come up as Agents</HI> on extraordinary Occasi∣ons,
are oblig'd to bear their own Charges,
which is a Hardship many of them may not
be very well furnish'd to bear.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="426"/>
2. Another Thing they complain of, is the
want of the Sanction of the Civil Power to en∣force
Ecclesiastic Discipline and Censure; for want
of which, obstinate Offenders are often encourag'd
to stand out in Scandal and in wicked Practices, and
refuse to submit to the Sentences of the Church,
however just, righteous, and moderate: This is
one Reason why the Nobility and Gentry very of∣ten
live in Defiance of Ecclesiastic Judicatures
and Process, even in the profess'd and avow'd
Commission of flagrant Crimes, such as blasphe∣mous
Swearing, open Drunkenness, Fornication,
and even Adultery it self; whereas were the Civil
Magistrate oblig'd to assist in the Execution of
Church Sentences, no Man would then be above
Reproof, and Punishment in just Cases.</P>
<P>But as I said before, these Things do not at
all break in upon the Church; either in her Do∣ctrine,
or in the Liberty of her Worship; they
may indeed affect the Establishment of her Dis∣cipline,
tho' not much, so that <HI>by the Treaty of
Ʋnion,</HI> it is to be hoped her last struggle with
Episcopacy is at an End; and she may now be
able to say, that not only she is arriv'd to her full
grown State, but that the Continuance of it is se∣cured
to her People and their Posterity.</P>
<P>This brings to my Mind, a Reproach usually
cast on the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> by her Enemies,
or rather it may be call'd an Insult, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That
Presbytery was often hatch'd in <HI>Scotland</HI> and nur∣sed
up. But was never <HI>Major;</HI> never came to be
<HI>of Age;</HI> alluding to a young Man, who tho' care∣fully
brought up, dies before he attains to the
Age of One and Twenty; But that Jest will serve
them, no longer, seeing it is now Eight and Twen∣ty
<PB N="325" REF="427"/>
Year since the Revolution, and since the pas∣sing
the Act for abolishing Episcopacy; and yet
Presbytry not only remains, but seems to be in a
better and more probable Way for Duration than
it ever has been since the Reformation.</P>
<P>It might be proper here to say a few Words by
way of Observation, concerning the present State
of the Discipline of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was confirm'd also at the Time of the Union, and
indeed I cannot refrain it for Two Reasons.</P>
<Q><P>1. That I think it is a Debt due to the Church
her self, who I find suffer innumerable un∣just
Reproaches, and is contemptibly
thought of, not among her Enemies only,
but even among those in <HI>England,</HI> whose
Interest as well as Principles ought to
move them to inform themselves better
concerning her, and who being better in∣form'd,
ought to do more justice to those
who so well deserve it at their Hands.</P>
<P>2. That she may be a Pattern to all the
several Sorts of Protestants in <HI>Britain,</HI> and
may shew them by her Example, not only
what the Blessing would be of an esta∣blish'd
well executed Discipline in a Na∣tional
Church, and of a laborious well re∣gulated
Clergy, but also how easy it is to
attain to it.</P></Q>
<P>I shall not examine into the Discipline of the
Two National Churches in this Island, in order to
compare them, to recommend one of them as
better than the other: But for their due Emulation,
this I may say, that supposing the Rules of their
Discipline equally good, yet no Man will deny
Two Things.</P>
<Q><PB N="326" REF="428"/>
<P>1. That the Church of <HI>England</HI> Discipline is
the most Neglected, the Execution of it
the most Incumber'd, and the Prosecution
made the most Difficult and Tedious, as well
as Expensive and Chargeable to the Prosecu∣tor
of any Protestant Church in the World.</P>
<P>2. That the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI>'s Discipline is
the most exact in Form, the most easy and
cheap to the Prosecutor, and the most
punctually and strictly Executed, without
Partiality, Bribery, or any sort of Cor∣ruption,
as also without a tiresome, tedi∣ous
and dilatory Proceeding, of any Church
Discipline in the World.</P></Q>
<P>Some of the Consequences of this, are these;</P>
<Q><P>1. The Ministers (for they are as much sub∣jected
to the Discipline of the Church as
the People, and perhaps more) are daily
and duly enquired into as to their Couduct,
and fail not to be Censur'd if they give
occasion of Scandal in the severest manner;
and in this Censuring of the Ministers in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> it is to be particularly observ'd,
That Ministers have there a severity used
with them, if they offend, which the
common People have not, and which per∣haps
no Ministers in the World but
these, are subject to, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if a Mi∣nister
falls into any scandalous Crime, for
which he is Deposed, he is Deposed for
ever; a private Man is receiv'd again, af∣ter
Scandal given, if he Repent and give
Satisfaction, but a Minister never.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="429"/>
NOTE, Upon Repentance and making
publick Acknowledgement to the Satisfa∣ction
or the Church, he shall be received
again to Communion as a Fellow Christi∣an,
but as a Minister he is perfectly use∣less,
and never can be repon'd,</P>
<P>NOTE <HI>also,</HI> That this severity is not by
the Law of Discipline, but the Practice
and Usage of the Church, the People will
never hear or receive such a Man as a Mi∣nister.</P>
<P>NOTE <HI>Thirdly</HI> That the happy Conse∣quences
of this Severity, and which must
be mention'd to the Honour of the Church
of <HI>Scotland;</HI> IS, That there is not a Mini∣ster
now preaching and exercising the Of∣fice
of a Pastor in the whole Church of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> who can be charg'd with any Im∣moralities
or scandalous Behaviour, except
such as are under Prosecution for the same.</P></Q>
<P>Could this be said of the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
or could it be said that all due Care, as far as her
own Laws would allow, was taken to bring it to
this, what a new Face would there be of Religion,
in this part of the Island!</P>
<Q>2. The People are retrained in the Ordinary
Practice of Common Immorallitles, such
as Swearing, Drunkenness, Slander, For∣nication,
Adultery and the like: As to
Theft, Murther, and other Capital Crimes,
they come under the Cogniscance of the
Civil Magistrate, as in other Countries;
<PB N="328" REF="430"/>
But in those Things which the Church has
Power to punish, the People being con∣stantly
and impartially prosecuted, they
are thereby the more restrained, kept so∣ber
and under Government, and you may
pass thro, Twenty Towns in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
without seeing any Broil, or hearing an Oath
sworn in the Streets; whereas if a Blind
Man was to come from thence into <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
he shall know the first Town he sets
his Foot in within the <HI>English</HI> Border, by
hearing the Name of God blasphem'd and
prophanely used, even by the very little
Children in the Street.</Q>
<P>Another Thing I cannot omit, in which the
Constitution of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> is Singular
and Differing from her Neighbours, and this, is
that not the least Room is left here for the popu∣lar
Charge of Priest-craft, with which the Deists,
Atheists and prophane People of this Age, Charge
the Ministers of the Gospel of all Perswasions, al∣ledging
that all they do is either under the Awe of
the Great Ones, to pursue their Interest and Li∣vings,
or with Wheedling and Delusion to win
upon the poor to make a Profit of them.</P>
<P>To the Honour of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> her
Ministers are so stated, as that (1.) They are under
no Influence, Awe, or Command from the Great
Ones; for the Stipend or Sallary of the Minister
depends not upon the Lord or Patron, but is set∣tled
by Parliament, to be paid duly by the Here∣tor,
or Person who receives the Tithes; and if he
refuses or delays, the Minister may demand it of
his Tenant, so that the Ministers are wholly in∣dependant
of the Gentry, how much soever the
poor People are in Bondage to them.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="431"/>
(2.) As they can lose nothing by the Anger of
the Gentry, they can get nothing by Favour of the
Commonalty; and this is very remarkable, that
no Fees, no Perquisites, no Advantages are made
of any kind by the Minister in his Parish, of or
from his People; He receives nothing for Burials,
Marriages, Baptisms, Visiting, or any other
Thing belonging to his Office as a Minister; So
that he has nothing to Wheedle the People into,
or for. On the contrary, as he presides in his
Kirk-Session or Vestry, he is rather a Magistrate
or Inspector over the Lives and Conversations of
his Parishioners, than a Tool to please and cajole
them, that he may get Money by them, as is too
much the Case in <HI>England,</HI> and in other Coun∣tries
also.</P>
<P>This Power of the Minister in his Parochial
Jurisdiction is that upon which Mr. <HI>Lauder,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Lauder,</HI> antient Bishops consider'd, cap. <HI>viii.</HI> page 316.</NOTE> in
that famous <HI>and yet unanswered</HI> Book of his, argues,
That a private Parish Minister in <HI>Scotland</HI> is a
compleat Diocesan Bishop, according to <HI>Cypri∣an,
and according to the Scripture Institution of a</HI>
Bishop; presiding in Judicature over his Flock or
Diocess, being Vested with the Power both to
Censure and Absolve; and that the Government
of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> by Kirk-Sessions, Pres∣byteries,
Synods, and General Assemblies, is real∣ty and
properly <HI>Episcopal Government,</HI> to all Intents
and Purposes, as the Government of the Church
<HI>was Episcopal</HI> in the Third and Fourth Centuries.</P>
<P>(30) The Office of a Minister in the Church of
<HI>Scotland</HI> is a quite different Thing from the Office
<PB N="330" REF="432"/>
of a Minister in <HI>England;</HI> that is to say, as it is
now Executed, either in the National Church or
among the Dissenters; and it may be said without
an Hyperbole, that were the Ministerial Office
subjected and discharged in <HI>England,</HI> as it is in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> in that Laborious Self-denying Manner,
and under such small Encouragements, Thousands
of the Clergy, I dare say, would with to have
been brought up Mechanicks rather than Parsons;
and scarce a Man that had any Temporal Estate
to subsist on, would take the fatigue of the Gown
upon them. Here are no Drones, no Idle Par∣sons,
no pamper'd Priests, no Dignities or Pre∣ferments
to excite Ambition, no Pluralities and
Curacies to encourage Sloth, no Authority or
Power over one another to gratify Pride, no Ex∣emtion
from the Laborious part, or Excuse for
not performing it.</P>
<P>Every Minister in <HI>Scotland</HI> preaches twice a Day,
and Lectures upon or Expounds a Chapter, or
part of a Chapter, before the Morning Sermon;
except only where in some large Parishes, there
are Assistants or Collegues allowed; every Mini∣ster
is bound by his Office to Visit every Family in
his Parish ministerially, and at least once a Year to
Examine every examinable Person in his Parish:
Every Minister is oblig'd in Conjunction with his
Elders, <HI>who with the Minister compose the Kirk-Session,</HI>
to take Cognisance of and hear all Complaints against
the Morals of every Person in his Parish, and to pro∣ceed
judicially as the Case shall require. Every
Minister likewise is obliged to Visit the Sick in his
Parish, when ever they send to him; nor is that
an easy Work in the Country where the Parishes
are large, and the Villages included in them re∣mote
from one another.</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="433"/>
Who ever considers the Office of a Minister in
<HI>Scotland,</HI> how faithfully the Ministers there execute
it, how constantly they preach, how painfully they
Study, how diligently they Examine, how duly
they Visit, will easily Account for that weak
Scandal that our People in <HI>England</HI> raise upon
them, <HI>(viz.) That we see none of their Writings:</HI>
And I shall add to it, what a Worthy and Reve∣rend
Divine of the Church of <HI>England</HI> said on
Occasion of that Reflection, (<HI>viz.</HI>) That if our
Ministers, as well of the Church, as the Dissenters,
would Study more, Preach more, Visit, Comfort,
Examine and Istruct their People more, though
they wrote less, it would be better Service to the
Church, and they would more deserve the Name
of Gospel Ministers.</P>
<P>There are many other Laborious things which the
Ministers of the Church <HI>Scotland</HI> go thousan'd, which
Ministers in England know nothing of; such as their
managing the Parish Charity, keeping the, Trea∣sure
for the Poor, for there are there neither
<HI>Church-Wardens</HI> or <HI>Overseers,</HI> their Travelling to
reconcile Breaches and heal Divisions among their
People their Expensive Journeys Monthly to the
Presbyteries, half Yearly to the Synods, and an∣nually
to the General Assemblies, and the like:
All which serve to make it true which was said by
an impartial Enquiror there, (<HI>viz.) That the Life
of an</HI> English <HI>Porter</HI> was easy compar'd to that of a
Presbyterian Minister in <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>Yet all this is supported and discharged with such
Courage, such Temper, such Steadiness in Applica∣tion,
such unwearied Diligence, such Zeal and Vigour
in the Work, that our <HI>English Sermon-Readers</HI> know
little of, not having the same Support, <HI>and I fear,</HI>
not the same Spirit to carry them thro'; in a Word,
as they have a Work which, humane Strength, is
<PB N="332" REF="434"/>
hardly sufficient to Discharge, so they have a Sup∣port
which humane Nature is not capable to sup∣ply;
and I must acknowlege that there seems to
be such an Appearance of the Spirit and Presence
or God with and in this Church, as is not at this
Time to be seen in any Church in the World.</P>
<P>Farther, as there is among the Ministers a Spi∣rit
of Zeal, and an earnest devoting of all their
Powers, Faculties, Strength, and Time to their
Work, so the Peoples Part is in proportion equal;
their Taste of Hearing, their Affection to their
Ministers, their Subjection to be Instructed, and even
to Discipline; their eagerness to follow the Directi∣ons
given; those are Things so visible in <HI>Scotland,</HI>
that they are not to be describ'd but admir'd; To
see a Congregation sit with Looks so eager, as if
they were to eat the Words as they came out of
the Mouths of the Preacher; to see the Affecti∣on
with which they hear, that there shall be a Ge∣neral
Sound of a Mourning thro' the whole Church
upon the extraordinary warmth of Expression in
the Minister, and this not affected and design'd,
but casual and undissembled.</P>
<P>And one Thing as a Hint, to <HI>English</HI> Hearers, I
cannot omit, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That in a whole Church full
of People, not one shall be seen without a Bible,
a Custom almost forgotten In <HI>England:</HI> On
the other Hand in a Church in <HI>Scotland,</HI> if you shut
your Eyes when the Minister Names any Text of
Scripture, you shall hear a little russling Noise over
the whole Place, made by turning the Leaves of
the Bible; nay, if a blind Body be at the Church,
they will have a Bible, which they will give to the
Persons next to them to fold down the Texts quo∣ted,
that they may cause some Body to read them
to them when they come home.</P>
<P><PB N="333" REF="435"/>
There are many more Circumstances, in which
I might show the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> to be happi∣ly
distinguish'd from most, if not all the other
Protestant Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> but the Particulars
are too many.</P>
<P>I wish I could have had Room in these Memoirs
to have set down the Heads of their Discipline,
which we call an <HI>England</HI> the Canon, but it is too
long; what has been said, as it is impartially sin∣cere,
so tho' short in Particulars, is sufficient to
let you know what a Church she is, and what a
Flourishing and Glorious State she is now in.
The Glory be to Jesus Christ, the Eternal King
and only Head of his Church, for ever and ever,
AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX
OF THE

OF THE
CHURCH
SINCE THE
UNION</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S these Memoirs were Written soon
after the Union between <HI>England</HI>
and <HI>Scotland</HI> was finish'd and rati∣fy'd,
so the Period chosen for the
last Part was proper to the Time;
but no less than Nine Years having
past since that Time, and before the Publication
here of, it is requisite that some Notice should
be taken of what has happen'd in that Time, and
this the rather, because some Depredations have
<PB REF="437"/>
been made upon the establish'd Liberties of the
Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> since that Time, and some
Attempts, even besides the open Rebellion of the
Jacobites, in Order, if possible, to pull down her
Fences, and lay open her Enclosure; that <HI>Jacob</HI>
might be given to the Spoil, and <HI>Israel</HI> to the
Robber.</P>
<P>But that Providence which has so eminently
guarded the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> in so many Dan∣gers,
has deliver'd her from this also, and now
she sees her self free again from farther Invasion.</P>
<P>We have seen in the Accounts pass'd, on what
Foot of Establishment the Church stood soon after
the Revolution, and how she went, even till the
Treaty of Union neither is there any Thing in
her History, which requires particular Notice du∣ring
that interval of Time. Farther 'tis obser∣vable,
that the Church being effectually restor'd <HI>as
before,</HI> and enjoying an uninterrupted Prosperity;
there remain'd nothing to be done in her Behalf,
at the Time of the <HI>Treaty of Ʋnion,</HI> but to preserve
her as she was in the full Enjoyment and <HI>Security</HI> of
her Doctrine, Discipline Worship and Govern∣ment.</P>
<P>For this Reason, when the Treaty began, it was
laid down as a Fundamental, <HI>That the Commissioners
on either Side should have no Power to enter into any Con∣ferences
upon the Ecclesiastick Settlement of either Na∣tion,</HI>
for as where was no View or Design, or indeed
possbility of bringing the Two Churches to unite:
So to agree at first, that both should remain <HI>just
at they were,</HI> was the only Method to put the Trea∣ty
in a way of being finish'd: The want of such a
Preliminary having been the only Reason why all
other Attempts for a Union had proved ineffectual
and come to nothing.</P>
<P><PB REF="438"/>
The Church then having no room to apprehend
that her Constitution should come to be debated
in this Treaty, had nothing left to do, but to
bring her Security to be one of the Articles of the
Union, and so bring the Episcopal Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
not only to Recognize her Establishment, but
to engage the whole Nation and Power of <HI>England</HI>
to support and maintain it.</P>
<P>And this alone made the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> be acknowledg∣ed
to be serviceable to the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> for
otherwise it must be allow'd, that it had been a
dangerous Thing for the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> which
was the weaker, to join and incorporate her Civil
Power, which was her Defence, with the <HI>English,</HI>
which was the stronger: But now the Security,
Liberty and Establishment of the Church of <HI>Scot∣land</HI>
being twisted with the <HI>English</HI> Constitution,
and built upon the same Foundation with that of
the Church of <HI>England</HI> it becomes invulnerable,
unless we shall suppose the whole Ecclesiastic and
Civil Constitution of <HI>Great Britain</HI> should suffer a
Convulsion, and be overturn'd and destroy'd.</P>
<P>Nor had the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> so good a Se∣curity
for her Establishment before; her Nobility
and Representatives, being not the best Friends to
her Constitution, often offended at the Severity of
her Discipline, and in part debauch'd from her
Principles by the Levity and Fashion of the Court;
and it was more than probable, that in time they
night have given a Blow to the Constitution of the
Church, which now it is for ever out of their
Power to do.</P>
<P>It is true, that there is not one Ounce of <HI>Good
Will</HI> the more between the Two Churches for this
Union, nor can I lay that the <HI>English</HI> Church has
not shewn her Teeth on several Occasions since
that: The <HI>Scots</HI> Episcopal Clergy have met with
<PB REF="439"/>
Encouragement in their insulting the Church, of
<HI>Scotland,</HI> as in the Case of Mr. <HI>Greenshields,</HI> who
let up a Meeting-House in the Teeth of the Ma∣gistrates
of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and vilely insulted them when
they touch'd him on that Head, telling them he
was a Member of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and ap∣pealing
from them to the House of Lords.</P>
<P>But after all, as the Government were convin∣ced,
that the Episcopal Men were in the Wrong,
and that they could not support the Design; so
the Man had some Money given him to withdraw,
and the Case was dropt as quietly as they could,
and with, that just Caution with which wise Men
generally drop a Thing they are ashamed of.</P>
<P>Nor can I say, that even the Union it self has
been so sacredly observ'd on the <HI>English Side,</HI> as
the Case of the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> required, or her
Privileges so well preserv'd as they had Reason to
expect, from the good Words which were given
them at the time of the Treaty; Witness the se∣veral
Attacks made upon them in the Affair of
Patronages, the Yule Vacance, and the imposing
Oaths upon the Ministers, inconsistent with their
principles; Things of which all I shall now say, is,
That as they were done in a Reign, which did
several other Things which the present Reign di∣sowns
and declares; against so we have great room
to hope, and the Church of Scotland to expect,
that those Impositions and Infractions of the Trea∣ty
will be repealed, and that she shall have
more Justice for the future.</P>
<P>The Church made what struggle they could at
that Time against the passing the Bill for restoring
Lay-Patrouages; the Agents they employ'd here
were heard by their Council, and considering how
much was said against it, and how little was, or
could be said for it, 'twas thought very unaccount∣able
<PB REF="440"/>
that such an Act should pass at all; but it must
be placed to the Account of the Times, and who
ever reflects upon the Persons who manag'd the
Affairs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and had the Power at that
Juncture, will find the Necessity they were in of
gratifying the Episcopal Party: Their Advocate
then was the Earl of <HI>Marr,</HI> the same who has
been since their Champion, and who was then
Secretary of State, it was no wonder then that the
Church had as little favour in every thing that
was mov'd against her, or wherein her Interest was
concern'd, as if she had been an Enemy; nor was
it in the Power of the few Gentlemen in <HI>England,</HI>
who were sensible of the Injury, and would have
serv'd her at that Time, to do any Thing for her.</P>
<P>However, a long Defence of her Privileges was
published and delivered to the Members of Parlia∣ment,
and was handsomely spoken to in the
House; and the Church had this Satisfaction, that
her Cause was lost by Numbers, not by Strength
of Reasoning, or of Right.</P>
<P>It would be too long to incert here the tedious
Account publish'd on that Occasion, by some who
shew'd their good Will, rather than Capacity to
State the Case: But the true State of the Case, as
it was presented to the House of Lords by the Three
Ministers deputed by the Church for that Purpose,
cannot but be proper to pubish, because it gives
the Churches Plea in her own Words, and is as fol∣lows.</P>
<DIV2>
<PB REF="441"/>
<HEAD>To the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Tempo∣ral
in Parliament Assembled. The Humble Represen∣tation
of William Carstairs, Thomas Blackwell
and Robert Baillie, Ministers of the Church of
SCOTLAND, concerning the Bill for restoring Patro∣nages,
now depending before your Lordships.</HEAD>
<P>IT is with all humble Duty and Submission re∣presented
unto your Lordships, that this de∣pending
Bill seems to be contrary to the present
Constitution of our Church, so well secured by
the late Treaty of Union, and solemnly ratified
by the Acts of Parliament in both Kingdoms: That
this may be more clear, it is to be observ'd, That
from, the first Reformation from Popery, the Church
of <HI>Scotland</HI> hath always reckon'd Patronages a Grie∣vance
and Burden, as is declared by the first and
second Books of Discipline, publish'd soon af∣ter
the said Reformation, since which Time they
were still judged a Grievance, till at length they
came by Law to be abolished.</P>
<P>These Patronages having been restor'd with
Episcopacy, in the Year 1661, and 1662; did
continue to the Year 1690, that Episcopacy was
abolish'd, and Presbyterian Government again esta∣blish'd;
and tho' the Act of Parliament 1690,
resettling Presbyterian Church Government, was
founded upon the Act of Parliament 1592, which
bears a Relation unto Patronages, yet the said Act
of Parliament 1690, doth expresly except that
Part of the old Act, and refer Patronages to be
thereafter consider'd, which accordingly was con∣sider'd
in the same Parliament 1690, whereby it is
plain, that the Abolition of Patronages was made
a Part of our Church Constitution, enacted by the
Act 1690, and that this Act 1690, with all other
Acts relative thereto being expresly ratified, and
<PB REF="442"/>
for ever confirm'd by the Act for securing the
Protestan Religion and Presbyterian Government,
and Ingross'd as an essential Condition of the Rati∣fications
of the Treaty of Union past in the Par∣liaments
of both Kingdoms, The said Act abolish∣ing
Patronages must be understood to be a Part
of our Presbyterian Constitution secur'd to us by
the Treaty of Union for ever.</P>
<P>Yet it is to be particularly consider'd, that the
same Parliament 1690, was so tender of the civil
Rights of Patrons, and so sincerely desirous only
to restore the Church to its just und primitive Li∣berty
of calling Ministers in a Way agreeable to
the Word of God, that they only discharged the
Patrons Power of Presenting Ministers to vacant
Churches, but as to any thing of their civil Rights,
did make the Condition of Patrons better than
before, not only by reserving unto them the Right
of Disposal of vacant Stipends, for pious Uses
within the Paroch, but also for giving unto them
the heretable Rights of the Tythes, restricting
the Minister, who formerly had the said Right to
Stipends, much below the Value of the said Tythes,
notwithstanding which advantageous Concession to
the Patrons by the Parliament, this Bill takes
back from the Church the Power of Presentation
of Ministers, without restoring the Tythes which
formerly belong'd to her, hy which the Parons
come to enjoy both the Purchase and the Price.</P>
<P>This being then the true Account of our legal
Settlement as to this Matter, it appears to be evi∣dent
that the Restitution of Patronages, as to the
Point of Presentation, can only gratify a few, while
on the other Hand it must necessarily disoblige a
far greater Number, that are now freed of that
Imposition, and indeed it cannot but seem strange,
that this Bill should be so much insisted upon,
<PB REF="443"/>
when there are so many Patrons, and those too of
the most considerable in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that are against
such a Restitution.</P>
<P>It is also apparent, that Presbyteries must come
under many Difficulties and Hardships, as to their
Compliance with this Innovation, and that many
Contests, Disorders and Differences, will probably
insue betwixt patrons, Presbyters, Heretors and
People, besides the known Abuses wherewith Pa∣tronages
have been attended even in their most
settled Condition; whereof many Instances might
be given; especially, that thereby a Foundation
was said for Simoniacal Factions, betwixt Patrons
and, those presented by them, and likewise Mini∣sters
were imposed upon Paroches by Patrons who
were utterly Strangers to their Circumstances, ha∣ving
neither Property nor Residence therein.</P>
<Q>It is therefore with all Submission expected from
your Lordships Justice and mature Deliberation,
That a Bill, as we humbly conceive, so nearly af∣fecting
the late Treaty of Ʋnion in one of its most
Fundamental and Essential Articles, respecting the
Preservation of the Rights and Privileges, which
our Church at that Time was possess'd of by Law,
for the Security of which the Parliament of Scot∣land
was so much concern'd as not to allow their
Commissioners to make it any Part of their Treaty,
but reserved it as a Thing unalterable by any Judi∣cature
deriving its Constitution from the said
Treaty, shall not be approv'd by Your Lordships,
especially while the Nature of the Treaty it self
shews it to be a reciprocal Transaction between the
Two Nations.</Q>

<P>Before the Commons, as have said, they
Were heard by Council; but all wag to no Purpose,
the Bill pass'd; and which is worse, we do not see
the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or even the Gentlemen
in the Parliament of <HI>Britain,</HI> who were actually a∣gainst
the Bill at that time, equally solicitous to
restore the Church now to the Privileges which
she lost then, how unjust soever the taking them
away has been.</P>
<P>Indeed we find the Commission of the Assembly
very earnest to solicit the redress of those Grie∣vances,
and not without Hope that it shall be ef∣fected:
And therefore, even while this was wri∣ting,
Two Ministers, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr.—<HI>Hamilton,</HI> Pro∣fessor
of Divinity in the College of <HI>Edinburgh,</HI> and
Mr. <HI>William Mitchel,</HI> one of the Ministers of <HI>Edin∣burgh,</HI>
are Deputed by the said Commission to at∣tend
the fitting of the approaching Parliament, to
get, if possible, Redress of the Churches Grie∣vances,
and a Repeal of those Acts which pass'd
in the preceding Reign in their Prejudice: The
Acts are particularly.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Act for restoring Patronages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Act for Tollerating Episcopal Meet∣ings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Act for the <HI>Yule</HI> Vacance; that is, for
keeping <HI>Christmas.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>If those Three are obtain'd, the Church will
then be restor'd to her full Lustre and Authority,
end its hoped will never more have any Occasion
to Complain of being Oppress'd.</P>
