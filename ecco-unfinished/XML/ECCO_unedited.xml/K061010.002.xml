<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T was easy to see at the
Close of the first Volume of
this Work, that the Subject
was not exhausted, whatever
the Tradesman was; and how
compleat soever he was to be made by
the intended Instructions of the Author,
and upon the Foot of the long Expe∣rience
of the Adviser, yet the Advices
were not compleat, and much remain'd to
be spoken, every Way as useful and ab∣solutely
necessary as what was said be∣fore.</P>
<P>THIS Volume has gone thorough with
the Work, and I doubt not will be found
both as profitable and as entertaining as the
other: As it is distinguish'd from the first
by the Nature of its Advices, so 'tis di∣rected
<PB N="vi" REF="4"/>
in a differing Manner: The first
Volume particularly called for the Atten∣tion
of young Tradesmen in their Begin∣ning,
Introduction, and first Steps in Trade,
in order to make their Way safe, their
Going on easy, and their End prosperous.</P>
<P>THIS Part is directed as well to the
old, as to the young Tradesmen; it is to
the Men of Business; as well to the over∣grown,
as to the growing; the upper Class,
as well as the lower; and it may be abso∣lutely
necessary to both.</P>
<P>WHILE the Tradesman is not above Tra∣ding,
he will find himself not out of the
Need of Caution: Age in Trade has its
trading Diseases as well as Age in Body,
and may in proportion stand in Need of the
Physician; and as ill Habits increase, and
grow fatal to Men in Years, and are hard∣est
to cure, so ill Habits in the Youth of
Trade, grow upon the Tradesman as his
Purse thickens, and his Strength in Trade
increases, and ought to be well guarded
against.</P>
<P>A young Tradesman has Dangers to
shun, and wise Measures to learn, the Good
or Evil of which are to himself; the old
well-thriven Tradesman, when his Measures
are taken, and when he is over Head and
<PB N="vii" REF="5"/>
Ears, as we call it, in getting Money, grows
dangerous to himself, and to the whole
Body of Tradesmen about him.</P>
<P>'TIS needful to warn them both; the
young against the early Practice, and the
old against the full-grown Habit; and the
first Part of this Work is adapted to both.</P>
<P>THE Length of the necessary Advices
has oblig'd me to leave out a very useful
Chapter, which was address'd to both Kinds
of Tradesmen, the Old, as well as the
Young: The Subject was against that dange∣rous
Thing, which the wise Man calls <HI>striking
Hands with a Stranger;</HI> by which I mean,
and so did <HI>Solomon</HI> also, the Tradesmens
being bound one for another.</P>
<P>IT is true, that as the particular Circum∣stances
of Trade are now stated, it is hardly
possible for Tradesmen to go through the
World in their Business without being
bound for one another; the high Duties,
such as Excises, Customs, and the Number
of Offices in the publick Revenue, obli∣ging
Men to get Bondsmen; the Govern∣ment
gives Credit, but requires Security,
and it seems absolutely necessary they
should do so; and this in some Things
makes my Advices be given with the more
Caution; but let it be upon what Occasion
<PB N="viii" REF="6"/>
it will, the Tradesman ought to be very
wary of engaging himself.</P>
<P>THREE Things every Tradesman ought
to consider before he strikes Hands with a
Stranger, that is, before he is bound for
another.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WHETHER he is able to pay the Debt;
for he that is bound for a Debt, must
expect to pay the Debt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT when he binds himself for his
Friend, he binds his Wife, Children,
and Estate, and brings them all into
the Hazard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT he binds also, all those innocent
Tradesmen who deal with him, and
perhaps trust him; who put their Estates
and Families, as it were, into his Hand,
and who in Justice ought not to be em∣bark'd
in the Risque, or brought to run
more Hazards than they are aware of.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>WOULD the considering Tradesman give
these three Heads their due Weight in his
Thoughts when he is called upon to do the
(fatal) kind Office of being Surety for his
Friend, he would not be easily drawn into
any Snare on that Account.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="7"/>
THERE are some Distinctions indeed which
should be made in this Case, and Sureti∣ship
should be divided into three Heads also:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. BEING Bail for Appearance: This indeed
depends not upon the Tradesman's Abi∣lity,
but his Honesty; for if the Bond
be for a Debt, the Man may not be
able to pay it; and so the Tradesman,
who is bound may be oblig'd to pay
the Debt, tho' the Man were honest; but
if it be only Bail for Appearance, that
he is always able to do if he be alive,
and if he dies, the Obligation ceases;
so that there is not the same Hazard
by a great deal.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. BEING bound for the Honesty of a
Person upon entering into publick Of∣fices
or Trusts This also depends up∣on
the Integrity of the Man, not his
Ability; and though it be more dan∣gerous
than the first, yet not equally
with the last.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. BUT the last is downright Suretiship
for the Debt; and the Tradesman ought
never to do it, unless, as above, his
Circumstances are such, that he can
pay the Debt without Hazard to his
Credit or to his Creditors.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="8"/>
I could not but mention this here, ha∣ving
been prevented from speaking at large
to it, in its proper Place, for want of Room.</P>
<P>THE latter Part of this Work may serve as
a Plan of the Inland Trade of <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI>
the Title is an Index of the Work;
its Uses are general, and it concerns the
younger as well as the elder Tradesmen;
the Tables, the Calculations, and the Con∣clusions
are equally needful and useful to
them all, and I could not think the Work
compleat without them.</P>
<P>THE whole Design is now perfected;
the World will see no more Volumes upon
this Subject; our Business being not to
multiply Books, but to make the Advices
compleat, that they may make the Trades∣men
so.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. I. <SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F HONESTY</HI> in Trade;
how rare to be found;
how necessary for the
promoting Commerce;
what Scandal the
Tradesmen generally lie under about it;
what the Meaning of it is; and how
to be understood; with a Word or two to
distinguish the Kinds of it. Page 28.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. II.</HI> Of the needful Capacities of a
compleat Tradesman; that he need not be
a Scholar, yet should not be a Dunce; that
he need not be a Wit, yet should not be a
Fool; that a competent Degree of Know∣ledge
is necessary to his Business; and al∣though
too much may rather make him
too enterprizing, or too indolent, yet the
Direction of Business requires, that a
Tradesman should be a Man of good Sense,
a Man of Ʋnderstanding and Judgment. 53.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xii" REF="10"/>
<HI>CHAP. III.</HI> Of the honest Tradesman, when
by Time and long Success in Trade, he is
grown well to pass, how he ought to go∣vern
himself, and how to guard against
Disasters, which naturally attend a pro∣sperous
Circumstance in Trade. Page 86.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Tradesman, when he has
thriven and grown rich by his Trade; how
he ought to act with regard to the Publick
Interest of Trade, as it respects the Coun∣try
he lives in; and of its being necessary
that Trade should run through as many
Hands as it can. 108.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> That a rich over-grown Trades∣man
should not, by Engrossings, Combina∣tions,
and other illegal Practices in Trade,
oppress and endeavour to ruin young Begin∣ners.
128.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. VI.</HI> Of what are the particular
Dangers, to which a rich over-grown
Tradesman may be liable, what he has to
fear, and how he may avoid a Miscarriage.
159.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. VII.</HI> That as the Tradesman is never
too high to fall, so he is never too low to
rise; and no Condition is so low or so de∣spicable
in a Tradesman, but he may with
Diligence and Application recover it.
182.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. VIII.</HI> That a <HI>Tradesman,</HI> though
standing himself secure, should have a cha∣ritable
Concern for those who miscarry, at
<PB N="xiii" REF="11"/>
least, should not insult and rejoice at their
Calamity. Page 191.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>CHAP. IX.</HI> That the rich Tradesman leaving
off, should endeavour to quit the World of
Trade in Peace, and go off in a Calm, with
the good Word of the Rich, and the Bles∣sings
of the Poor, and whatever he was
before, be well spoken of at last. 210.</ITEM>

the Folly and the Scandal of it;
and how justly ridiculous it renders him
in the World. 227.</ITEM>

and litigious, forward to go to Law
for every Trifle, and to be always embroil'd

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<DIV3 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>Itherto we have talk'd in a Dia∣lect
suited to the young Trades∣man,
to whom the Subject was
more immediately directed, and
given Advices, as the Circum∣stances
of young Beginners might be sup∣posed
to want it.</P>
<P>AT the first Entrance into Trade, the
Tradesman, like a young Commander of
a Ship, launching into the Ocean for a
long Voyage which he had never been be∣fore,
should look out for skilful Assistants,
as the Captain take experienced Mates,
and, if need be, a good Pilot, that knows
the Coast, to stand to him, and give him
<PB N="2" REF="14"/>
good Direction, when he comes to make
Land; to describe the Bearings, try the
Depths, and other Difficulties which usually
occur in such Cases.</P>
<P>OUR former Work has been recommend∣ed
as a Pilot or Guide to the young Trades∣men
of this Island; and as it was no more
than what was extremely wanted among
them, so they cannot suggest that it has not
been significant; worth my undertaking,
and their Acceptance; nothing of the like
Nature having been attempted before;
it must be acknowledged then to be useful,
unless they that suggest otherwise will first
tell us that the Tradesmen of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
are an inconsiderable Branch of our
People, a Class whose Significance is not
much, their Number small, and their Pro∣sperity
of little Importance to the whole
Body of the Nation.</P>
<P>BUT they must be extremely ignorant of
the State of Commerce in this Nation, and
of the Number and Weight of the Trades∣men
among us, who would venture to say
so; for that though <HI>it is true</HI> I confine my
whole Discourse to the Tradesmen concern'd
in our Inland Trade only, which they call the
lowest Class, and the meanest of the trading
World, next but one Degree above the la∣bouring
Poor, yet I must lay this Objection
in their Way, <HI>viz.</HI> that as low as they may
or can suppose them to be, they are the
<PB N="3" REF="15"/>
most essential to the Trade itself, the most
considerable in Number, and employ among
them the largest Share of the Capital
Stock of the whole Kingdom, having also,
without Comparison, the greatest Share of
Credit: Let us join Issue then upon that
Point, and examine the Particulars.</P>
<P>IT would be hard, indeed, to make a Guess
at the Numbers of those I call Tradesmen,
as they are described in our former Volume,
and to whom that Discourse and this is to be
directed, and who are employed in the In∣land
Trade of this Nation: I'll first give you
a new Description of them in a few Words.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THEY are to be understood to contain
all those People through whose Hands
the Produce and Manufacture of <HI>Great
Britain</HI> pass for Sale from their being
finished, and fitted for the Market to
their immediate Consumption or Expor∣tation;
the Wholesale Tradesmen being
the first Buyer, and the Retale Shop-Keeper
the last Seller of all the said
Produce and Manufacture.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. ALL those Tradesmen who are likewise
employed in buying Goods of foreign
Growth, from the Merchant who is the
Importer; and selling them again as well
by Wholesale as Retale, from one to
another, how many Hands soever they
<PB N="4" REF="16"/>
may pass through, whether to be manfac∣tured
or worn, till, as above, they come
to the last Consumer: Of all which I
shall speak at large in its Order.</ITEM>
</LIST>
By the last Consumer here is not merely un∣derstood
those that eat or wear, and so con∣sequently
consume the Goods, whether the
home Produce and Manufacture, or the fo∣reign
Importation; but those other Trades∣men
or Manufacturers, who, in their ordinary
Employments and Business, use up and em∣ploy
those Goods as Materials, or absolutely
necessary Articles in the making, or manufac∣turing,
or preparing other Goods. <HI>For Ex∣ample;</HI></P>
<P>FIRST the Wool is carried from Place to
Place before it comes to the Manufacturer,
and is made the Subject of Trade in two or
three Capacities, <HI>viz.</HI> from the Farm to the
Wool-Stapler, or from the Butcher to the
Fell-Monger; from those again to this or
that Market, and sometimes to several; then
to the Wool-Comber, and at last is bought by
the Woollen Manufacturer, by whom it is
brought to the Consumption: For there is an
End of its Species as Wool; it no longer bears
its own Name, but is lost in the several Names
of the Manufacture into which it is con∣verted.</P>
<P>So the Oil imported from <HI>Sevill, Lis∣bon,
Cadiz, Gallipoli,</HI> and several other
<PB N="5" REF="17"/>
Places, or made at our own Oil-Mills,
and the <HI>Train</HI> Oil brought from <HI>New Eng∣land,
Newfoundland, Greenland, &amp;c.</HI> is all
lost in the Hands of the said Manufacturers;
they are properly the last Consumers.</P>
<P>THE several Drugs and Dye-Stuffs, such as
Dying Woods, Braziletto, <HI>Nicaragua Wood,</HI>
Logwood, Fustick, Shumach, and the like;
the Red Earth, the Lichen, the Gums,
the Gauls, Cochineal, Indico, Woad, and
abundance of other Things both of our
own and foreign Growth, which are the Sub∣ject
of Commerce, and very considerable Ar∣ticles
of Trade, are lost in the Dye-Fat,
and the Dyer is to them the last Consumer:
The like of Painters Colours, which include
abundance of curious Things, the Produc∣tions
both of Nature and Art.</P>
<P>THE like also of Drugs used in Medicine,
the Furniture of the Labaratories of the Learn∣ed,
the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the Physician's
Practice, the Fundamentals of all Pharmacy,
and the Assistants to Art, whether in Phy∣sick
or Surgery, the Chymist and the Gale∣nist,
the Surgeon and Apothecary, are the
last Consumers; and all Persons, through
whose Hands those Things pass by way of
Sale, either from the first Grower or Planter
of them at home, or the Importer of them
from abroad, are what I properly call <HI>Trades∣men.</HI>
For Example;
<Q><PB N="6" REF="18"/>
<P>THE Dye Stuffs are bought from the Mer∣chant
Importer by the <HI>Salter,</HI> he is the
Tradesman; he sells some of them to
the Country Shop-Keepers, and they are
Tradesmen in that particular Article;
for of those the Dyers buy them, who
the last Consumers.</P>
<P>THE Drugs are bought from the Merchant
Importer by the Druggist, and by him
sold to the Chymist, or to the Apothe∣cary,
the Surgeons, and the Physicians,
such of them (at least) as make up any
Medicines, Salves, or other Prepara∣tions
of their own; and these are the
Tradesmen in those particular Cases;
and so of the rest.</P></Q>
But ordinarily the last Consumer of every
Species in Trade, is the Person who buys by
Retale for his own or his Family Use, such
Things either for eating, drinking, wearing,
or using, as are never to pass any farther in
Sale.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE the Person who, as a Mer∣chant
or Adventurer, buys for Exportation,
and for Consumption in foreign Parts, so
that it is no more exposed to Sale, or
passes through any other Hands trading in
this Island or Country: These are indeed
the last Consumers, <HI>as to us,</HI> and are at
the End of the Inland Commerce, as much
as if they were the Consumers of those Goods
themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="19"/>
Now all the People thus concerned be∣tween
the two Extremes, between the Growth
and the Consumption or Exportation of the
Goods, are properly the Tradesmen I am
speaking of. If any Man will call these by
the Diminutives I have mentioned above,
such as People of a low Figure, a mean
Class, few in Number, and of no Impor∣tance,
let them, before they go on too fast,
tell us, if them can, how many they are; not
how many in proportion to others, but how
many Thousands, nay, how many hundred
Thousand they are; and then let them calcu∣late
the Weight they bear in Trade, and the
Consequence they are of to the rest of the
Nation: Let them tell us something, if they
can; for no Man can give a full Account
of it.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Of the Stocks they employ, and the
Wealth and Substance that is in their
Hands.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Of the Credit they give, and how ma∣ny
Thousands of other Families are to
trade under them, and live upon them,
being supported and made able to carry
on their several Employments, by the
Assistance of the Shop-Keepers and
Tradesmen, with whom they deal:
How they trust the Manufacturer for
Wool, for Oil, for Metals, and even for
Tools to work with: How they trust
<PB N="8" REF="20"/>
even the Merchant for what he exports,
and often take his Imports, which are
the Returns for the same Goods, in pay∣ing
for the Credit given.</ITEM>
</LIST>
These two Articles alone make the Impor∣tance
of the Inland Tradesmen be out of
question great, and represent them in general
as the most considerable People in the whole
Kingdom, I mean as to the Trade of the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>How do all that infinite Number of Peo∣ple
employed under them in Carriage of
Goods only from Place to Place, depend en∣tirely
upon them; the Tradesmen are the
Masters, who keep so many Thousands of
Men, Horses, Carriages, Waggons, Carts,
Boats, and Ships employed, and all the la∣bouring
Employments depending upon these
Carriages.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> By Ships and Boats, here I am to
be understood, only such Vessels, of all
Sorts, as are employed in the River Navi∣gation,
and the Coasting Trade of <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> not concerning the Ships of the
Merchants employed abroad in it at all,
though the Inland Tradesmen are the
Life even of the merchandising Part
itself also.</Q>
<P><PB N="9" REF="21"/>
IT is scarce possible to make a Calcula∣tion
of the Money expended yearly in this
Kingdom, in the Charge of carrying and
recarrying Goods from Place to Place: First
from the Tradesman to the Manufacturer;
then from the Manufacturer to the Markets
and Fairs. I have heard that there has been
paid above fifty thousand Pounds for the
Carriage only of Goods to and from <HI>Stur∣bridge-Fair</HI>
in the Time of one Fair only:
I do not vouch the Calculation, but I must
say, I believe it is sometimes with the least.</P>
<P>IF the like Calculation was to be made of
the Money paid yearly for Carriage to and from
this City of <HI>London</HI> only, suppose it drawn
but from some particular Trade, what an im∣mense
Sum would it amount to? For Ex∣ample:
The Freight paid annually to Vessels
employed to bring Corn, Meal, Malt, Sy∣der,
Fruit, Coals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to the City, what an
Article might it be called, and how asto∣nishing
would it be to a Stranger, if it could
be fairly represented? The Number of Ves∣sels
of all Sorts, their Value, the Trades
employed in building and fitting them out,
and in their continual Supplies, Repairs, and
the Number of Men in sailing and mana∣ging
them; and all by the Inland Trades∣men:
Of which you will see a farther Ac∣count
given in this Work, and some probable
Calculations also.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="10" REF="22"/>
<ITEM>1. THE Barges and Luggage-Boats em∣ployed
in the <HI>Thames</HI> above Bridge,
as 'tis called, including only those on
the River <HI>Lea</HI> below Bridge, all gene∣rally
employed in bringing Malt, Meal,
Timber, Fire-Wood, Cheese, Paper,
and other bulky Goods, from several
Countries adjoining to those Rivers,
and carrying back Coals, Salt, Iron,
Lead, Oil, Tar, Hemp, Dyers Stuff,
and the like heavy Goods; as also Gro∣cery
of all Kinds, for the Use of the
Country Shop-Keepers, called Trades∣men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE Coasting Vessels of all Kinds em∣ployed
from the Northern and Wes∣tern
Coasts of <HI>England,</HI> exclusive of
<HI>Newcastle</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> North, and of
<HI>Cornwall, Wales,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> West;
whose Loading is generally delivered
at <HI>Bear-Key, St. Katherine's,</HI> and the
<HI>Bridge-House.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THE Coal-Ships and Corn-Ships from
<HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Coast of <HI>Scotland,</HI>
and from <HI>Wales</HI> and <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>London,</HI>
importing Coals, Salt, Fish, Butter,
Cheese, Culm, Rock Salt, Block Tin,
Copper Ore, Tallow, Linnen, and
Syder.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THE Fishing Vessels for the same Con∣sumption,
only such as in the Season
<PB N="11" REF="23"/>
bring Oysters, Cod, Lobsters, Sprats,
Macrael, and Herring, to <HI>Billingsgate.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IF it was possible to make a Calculation
of these Things, we might from them, as
the Painter from the Foot of <HI>Hercules,</HI>
draw some probable Estimate of this Trade
called <HI>Inland,</HI> also of the Number and Im∣portance
of those People I am speaking
of, called <HI>Tradesmen,</HI> of the Business they
do, and the Return they make in Trade:
But how shall it be done? The very Freight
of Coals, including that of the Keels, which
load them at <HI>Newcastle,</HI> and the Lighters,
Carts and Horses, Boats and Barges, which
unload them, and carry them on to the last
Consumer, is supposed to amount to at least
350000 <HI>l. per Annum,</HI> for the River of <HI>Thames</HI>
and the Countries adjacent only: And what
else should raise the Value of the Coals be∣tween
the Coal-Pit whence they come, and
the Chimney, where they end from four
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Chaldron to Thirty, and in
many Places to forty or fifty Shillings <HI>per</HI>
Chaldron.</P>
<P>IF the Carriage of Coals only runs thus
high, what must all the Corn-Trade, Malt∣Trade,
and the other Particulars mentioned
above, backward and forward, necessarily
amount to; of which, to say no more, we
may conclude, that the Money expended in
the mere Carriage of Goods, to and from, for
<PB N="12" REF="24"/>
the Inland Commerce and Consumption of
this Island, amount at least to two Millions
<HI>per Annum;</HI> and what must then the Value
of the Goods themselves amount to?</P>
<P>SHOULD I descend to the Particulars of
Land Carriage, and the Water Carriage on
the West, and Middle Parts of <HI>England,</HI>
the Navigation of the <HI>Severn</HI> and <HI>Wye,</HI>
the <HI>Trent,</HI> the <HI>Humber,</HI> the <HI>Ouse,</HI> the
<HI>Yare,</HI> and all the Rivers which are na∣vigable
into and out of them; the Coasting
Trade on the Side of <HI>Wales,</HI> and the <HI>Bristol</HI>
Channel and the Coal-Trade of <HI>Swanzy</HI>
and <HI>Whitehaven,</HI> it would shew us a little
the Magnitude of the <HI>British</HI> Home-Trade,
and, by consequence, how considerable the
Tradesmen of this Island are; for that's the
Point I am now directing myself to.</P>
<P>THE Number of Horses and Carriages
for the carrying Goods to Fairs, and to
and from the Sea-Ports and navigable Ri∣vers,
it is so prodigious a Thing, that if the
Trade itself, and the Tradesmen which ma∣nage
it, were not incredibly great and consi∣derable,
beyond expressing, what could it be
supported by?</P>
<P>LET no Man then pretend to tell us the
Tradesmen of <HI>Great Britain</HI> are a mean
and inconsiderable Class of Men, and of
small Importance in the Affair of Commerce:
It is most certain, that the greatest Stroke
of Trade in the whole World is carried on
<PB N="13" REF="25"/>
under their Hands, and by their Stocks: They
are the Life of all the Inland Trade of the
Nation: The whole Manufacture and Pro∣duce
goes through their Hands: They are
in all their Circumstances beyond our Cal∣culation:
In their Number monstrous, and
beyond all Conjecture: In their Substance,
yet infinitely more, and beyond all Account:
As also in the Credit they both give and
take for the carrying on the said Commerce.</P>
<P>As they are then so considerable a Body,
and really much more then I have or can set
forth in Writing, it is not of small Import
to speak to them by way of Inftruction: The
ill or well Government of such a Body of
People must be of Consequence to the pub∣lick
Interest; the evil or good Management of
such a Weight of Business must have a great
deal depending upon it; the Consequence of
any general Mistake, and of any false Steps
taken in an Affair which the whole Com∣munity
of Trade must be so much concern'd
in, must be very great.</P>
<P>A vulgar Error, generally espoused in such
a Case as this, and in carrying on such a
Commerce, may at any Time be fatal to the
whole Commerce; at least, any Thing uni∣versally
espoused among them, is either ex∣ceedingly
to the Good and Advantage of the
whole Body, or to their Damage and Loss.</P>
<P>A Miscarriage here is in Commerce, as a
Plague or Infection is in the State of Health,
<PB N="14" REF="26"/>
dangerous and destructive to the whole Body,
and may be as fatal in Proportion: For Ex∣ample;
any Stagnation of Credit, any Alte∣ration
of Coin, any publick Tax imprudent∣ly
laid upon this or that Branch of the Trade
where it is rival'd by Foreigners: How do
such Things spread their Influence through
the whole Body, and give a Wound not to
this or that Tradesman in particular, but to
the whole Article of Trade in general?</P>
<P>How did the Advance of the Rate of Gui∣neas,
so long ago as the Year 1694-95. give
a Shock to the whole Trade, and to all the
Manufacture of <HI>Britain?</HI> And had it not
been prudently check'd, and provided against
by the Parliament immediately following,
how would it have brought an immense
Wealth out of the publick Stock of the Na∣tion
into the Hands of Foreigners. For Ex∣ample;</P>
<P>AN
Ounce of Gold cost from three Pounds
eighteen Shillings to four Pounds; at last,
came to four Pounds five Shillings in <HI>Hol∣land</HI>
or <HI>France:</HI> This being sent over hither,
and coined into Guineas, at thirty Shil∣lings,
immediately yielded six Pounds; with
this six Pounds costing four Pounds, that
<HI>Dutch</HI> Man or Foreigner going to Market,
bought as many <HI>English</HI> Manufactures as the
<HI>English</HI> Merchant could buy for six Pounds,
really costing six Pounds Sterling; consequent∣ly
when these Goods came to Market, suppose
<PB N="15" REF="27"/>
at <HI>Cadiz</HI> or <HI>Lisbon,</HI> that <HI>Dutch</HI> Merchant
was able to sell as cheap, with 25 <HI>per Cent.</HI>
Gain, as the <HI>English</HI> Merchant could sell with
25 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Loss.</P>
<P>THIS is a plain Case; and had it gone on,
the <HI>Dutch</HI> would in a little while have got
all the <HI>British</HI> Manufacture into their Hands
for nothing, and the <HI>English</HI> Merchant abroad
must have been undone, and in the End the
Manufacturer also.</P>
<P>I COULD give Instances of other publick
Disasters, which, when they fall upon Trade,
are to it as publick Calamities are to a Na∣tion:
And this is the Reason why seasonable
Advices to Tradesmen are from being low∣priz'd,
or to be esteemed needless or imper∣tinent;
when the greatest Dangers are in
View, the most early Councils are and ought
to be esteemed friendly and valuable.</P>
<P>NOT that I assume the Station of an In-structor
to all the Tradesmen of <HI>Great Bri∣tain;</HI>
but something may possible be said,
which all the Tradesmen in <HI>England</HI> may
pick useful Things from, and apply to
proper Purposes for the general Good:
The wiser Tradesmen will make good use of
those Advices, which they have the least
occasion for; and the rest will both find oc∣casion
for them, and make use of them
with Prudence for their own Advantage.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="28"/>
BUT our Undertaking wants no Excuses,
no Flourishes; it is directed chiefly to Peo∣ple
who, being young in Business, and newly
venturing upon Trade, cannot have any Pre∣tence
to be above Directions: Such as not
being grown Compleat Tradesmen, are in the
Way for it, and cannot but want Direction
in their Way.</P>
<P>To such what is past has been directed,
and they have accepted the Good-will of it,
and given Testimony to the Weight of the
Advices.</P>
<P>WE are now turning the Tables, and
talking to the Tradesmen in another Capa∣city:
Before I directed them how to thrive;
I am now telling them how to behave when
they are thriven; how to improve upon their
Improvement; grow rich after they are
grown rich; and to act in the Shape and Ap∣pearance
of established Tradesmen already
thriven.</P>
<P>THERE are Measures still wanting for the
Tradesman, even after he is grown rich: 'Tis
never too late to give him due Caution to de∣serve
his Character, preserve the Reputation he
has got, and keep his Money. I have given you
great Examples of the Miscarriages of those
in Trade, who once thought themselves as
much above the World as any Tradesmen
now in <HI>Great Britain</HI> can do, who thought
themselves out of the Reach of Disaster,
above the Shocks of Fortune, above the
<PB N="17" REF="29"/>
Fear, or even the Possibility of a Blow:
How many such have I seen come down,
even till they became below Contempt.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman, as he is never out of
Danger of being overborn in his Commerce,
so he is never out of the Danger of a Blow
to his Credit; and for both those Reasons can∣not
be out of the Reach of good Council.</P>
<P>You will be apt to say in Contempt of
this, that they are out of Danger of a Wound;
they are stanch, and fear nothing, and there∣fore
'tis good Council to them to defy Dan∣gers
distant or present; and in Cases of real
and present Dangers, to be as bold as if they
were all distant.</P>
<P>ONE of the greatest Dangers attending
a thriving Tradesman, is, lest he should do
some little weak Thing to adventure his
Credit, or some gross and foolish Thing to
endanger his Stock. I have here given Exam∣ples
where the greatest and best-assur'd have
miscarried; and we shall see 'tis very easy.</P>
<P>THE Account I have given in this Work of
the Magnitude of our Commerce, is an Argu∣ment
to confirm this Danger: There are Ad∣venures
in the <HI>British</HI> Trade, too big for any
Man's single Head, and too big for any Man's
single Strength; too great for the Grasp of
their Estates, let them be what they will;
and the rich overgrown Tradesman has as
much need to be cautioned to keep within
Compass, and to avoid Projects and Projec∣tors,
<PB N="18" REF="30"/>
as any the poorest and youngest Head
of them all; and in one Respect more, name∣ly,
that the higher his Leap, the greater his
Fall; the more his Adventure, the more
Danger of his Miscarriage.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the rich well-increased Trades∣man,
as he has a great Stock in Trade, so
he has a great Fund of Credit; and he ought
to be more cautious than another Man, how
he does any Thing to lessen his Character,
and wound his Credit.</P>
<P>THEY say of young Surgeons, they will
make desperate Attempts, push at all, and
sometimes do great Cures by those enterpri∣sing
Things, when a long-experienced, rich,
establish'd Surgeon will not offer at them,
will not meddle or venture upon such Things,
because he will not hazard his Reputation,
and bring his Credit upon the Stage in case
of a Miscarriage.</P>
<P>IF the establish'd Tradesman is then in
Danger; if he wants to be caution'd in the
great Article of his Reputation; if it is easy
for the bigest to grasp beyond his Reach,
and, like <HI>Milo,</HI> in Presumption of his
Strength, be fasten'd in the Cleft till he is
devoured; then this second Volume of Di∣rections
to the Compleat Tradesman, is as
much to the Purpose as the first, and in some
respect more, because the People this is di∣rected
to are infinitely of more Consequence
in case of a Disaster.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="31"/>
A Tradesman, like a great Tree in a
thick Wood, if he falls, he is sure to crush
a great deal of the Under-Wood which lies
within the Reach of his Boughs and Branches.
A young Tradesman miscarries, and it reaches
but a little Way; a few Creditors are affect∣ed,
and some Hurt is done: But if the over∣grown
Tradesman falls, he shakes the <HI>Ex∣change,</HI>
as we call it; he dips deep among
other Tradesmen; he pulls down here half
a Dozen, and there half a Score; and they
pull down others, and, like rolling Nine∣pins,
they tumble down one another.</P>
<P>THE Fall of a great Tradesman is a Shock
even to the Trade itself; he sinks every
Man about him: As his Credit was good,
so his Debts are large; if he owes Mo∣ney,
'tis not by Hundreds, but by Thou∣sands,
which strikes deep into the Pro∣sperity
of all round about him, and the
whole Trade is said to suffer by him: He
pulls down Families; and if twenty Top∣ping
Tradesman fall with him, as is some∣times
the Case, those twenty may bring down
every one two or three more, and so on,
the Destruction is endless.</P>
<P>IT is not, therefore, for nothing that I
direct my first Cautions to these great Trades∣men;
much less is it a useless Argument,
that I begin to use with them, <HI>viz,</HI> to insist
upon their Honesty: Honesty is never out
of Season to a Tradesman; but more essen∣tial
<PB N="20" REF="32"/>
when he is grown great and rich, than
even at his Beginning. At first we say there
is no Fear of him; he dares not be a
Knave; his Stock of Credit being just in its
Rise, and the Foundation but just laying,
he cannot but know that the least unfair
Action exposes him at once, and he is
blown up and gone.</P>
<P>BUT when the Tradesman is thriven, and
grown rich, his Character establish'd, and
his Credit past Danger, then he can act, as
we say, secure, and take greater Liberties
then he durst do before: Then is the Tryal
of his Principles, as an honest Man, and
then indeed is the most Danger of his being
a K—.</P>
<P>'Tis hard, you'll say, that a Man should
be in most Danger of turning a Knave, when
he has the least Temptation to it. When
Men are poor, and are found guilty of little
Prevarications and Infractions of Principle,
Necessity and Poverty is the Plea, and passes
with some People for an Excuse; though, by
the Way, it is no more so, than Poverty is
a Plea at the <HI>Old Baily,</HI> for committing a
Robbery or a Burglary.</P>
<P>BUT when we are speaking comparatively,
'tis certainly a just Way of arguing, that a
poor Man has a stronger Temptation, and
may be the more an C<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bject of our Pity,
when he makes a Slip, because his Distress
was great: He has perhaps a Family, and
<PB N="21" REF="33"/>
his Circumstances are low; the Temptation
strong, the Necessity great, and who knows
what he might do in this Case? 'Tis a hard
Thing to see a Family starve, and having a
Loaf of Bread in his keeping, entrusted with
him by a Neighbour, refuse to cut it, be∣cause
it was not his own; and where that
honest Man is, I must confess I do not know.
But that's out of my Way at present; I shall
touch it again presently.</P>
<P>BUT if the poor Man has no Excuse,
much less has the rich: If he has nothing
to say but his Poverty, what has the rich
Man to say: To be rich is to be without
Temptation; the rich Tradesman may have
the greatest Opportunity of being a K—,
but he has much the least Temptation to it,
or Excuse for it.</P>
<P>AND yet so it is, every Station of Life
has its Snares attending it, and every Degree
of Business has its Invitation to do Evil:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Necessity tempts the poor Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Avarice tempts the rich.</ITEM>
</LIST>
It is true, they are both, to the last Degree,
criminal in yielding to the Temptation; but
the latter much more than the former; for
he is tempted by that which is in itself a
Crime: 'Tis not criminal to be poor; Ne∣cessity
is no Offence till it makes itself a
Snare, and places itself in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Stead:
<PB N="22" REF="34"/>
But <HI>Avarice</HI> is a Crime in its Nature; 'tis
a <HI>Devil</HI> in its very Kind, born of Hell, and
infused in the very Soul itself: The first is
an Accident to the Man, a Circumstance of
Life, and comes from without; but Avarice
is within the Man; 'tis mingled, as we say,
with his Animal Life; it runs in his Blood;
it has insinuated itself into his very Species,
and he is truly, as the Text says, <HI>drawn
aside by his own Lust, and enticed.</HI></P>
<P>Now, speaking of Honesty in this Situa∣tion,
the rich Tradesman is tempted in a
more violent Manner than the poor, and
perhaps is equally unfortified against the
Attack, consequently he is every Way as
liable to fall into it. There are, for ought
I know or see, as many rich trading K—<HI>s</HI>
as poor ones, and, in proportion to their
Number, many more; and it cannot, there∣fore,
be taken amiss, that I begin this Work
with the Importance of this great Article of
Trading HONESTY.</P>
<P>IT is not less to the Purpose, in speaking
to the superior Rank of Tradesmen, to ad∣monish
them of that dangerous Article of
Trading Tyranny; and that they should
avoid, as much as lies in them, making them∣selves
a Grievance in Trade, a Prejudice to
the Commerce itself, as well as to their
Neighbours; 'tis certain that a rich well∣thriven
topping Tradesmen may be a Bles∣sing
to the Publick, as he is a Credit to it;
<PB N="23" REF="35"/>
and he may carry on a great Trade, without
being a Hindrance to others, especially if
he will preserve the Title of a fair and ge∣nerous
Tradesman, that is, willing to let
other Men live by him, and live with him
in Trade.</P>
<P>BUT if on the other Part he sets up to be
an Engrosser, that is to say, an Oppressor
in Trade; if by the Strength of his Cun∣ning,
and the Strength of his Stock united,
he commits Spoil, and, as it may be truly
called, ravages the Trade, and runs down
his Neighbours, he is not only so far a pub∣lick
Grievance in Trade, but is not indeed
an honest Man; nor can he be called so, for
he is far from doing as he would be willing
other Men should do by him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I have touch'd this Point as
gently as I could, allowing a needful Liber∣ty
to explain the Gr<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vance, so as to convince
this Tradesman that it is really such; that it
is not a fair Way of Trading; and that by
this Practice he becomes an Oppressor, in∣deed,
a Plunderer, a meer Trading Dragoon,
and destroys not the Tradesman only, but
the Trade itself.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told by some People, on
reading the first Volume of this Work, that
having never duly considered the Thing it∣self
in its full Latitude, as I have laid it
down, they did not look upon the Inland
Trade of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to be any Thing
<PB N="24" REF="36"/>
so considerable as they now find it is; that
the Tradesmen, that is to say, the Shop-Keepers
and Warehouse-Keepers of <HI>England,</HI>
were in their Opinion a mean Kind of Peo∣ple,
not so considerable either for their Num∣ber,
their Wealth, or their Usefulness, as
they now find they are; and that they thought
my Work was accordingly of no great Im∣portance.</P>
<P>FOR this Reason I thought it was need∣ful
to let them see in a clear Light, how far
they are mistaken, and how apparent it is
that the whole Weight of the Inland Com∣merce
of <HI>Great Britain</HI> is in the Hands of
these People who I call <HI>Tradesmen,</HI> how
numerous and how considerable they are;
upon which indeed the Importance of this
Work will be abundantly seen.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, when I direct my Work to
the Tradesmen of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and their
several Dependants, Servants, Journeymen,
Apprentices, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am talking to above two
Millions of People, all living, as we may
call it, at their own Hands, Trucking, Bar∣tering,
Buying, Selling, Turning and Twis∣ting,
this Way and that Way, all the needful
Subjects of Commerce, and every one pick∣ing
a Penny by them in their Passage.</P>
<P>PRODUCTION and Consumption are the
two great Extreams of Commerce, as Gene∣ration
and Corruption are the two great Ends
of Nature; in a Word, as Beginning and
<PB N="25" REF="37"/>
Ending are the two great Extreams of all
Things in the World, and even of the World
itself.</P>
<P>I have therefore spent a little Time to
make the World sensible of the Magnitude
and Importance of this unknown and little
consider'd Article of the <HI>English</HI> Inland
Trade, how and by what Means it is car∣ried
on and manag'd to such a Prodigy as it
is; by which the Tradesmen will know,
that it is not of a small Concern to the Na∣tion,
that their Way is directed, and that they
are told in a familiar, plain, but effectual
Manner how they ought to guide their Af∣fairs,
and how to act, so as to be useful both
to their Country and to themselves.</P>
<P>SOME Descriptions of the Commerce itself
may come in too of course; and are absolutely
necessary to the forming in the Tradesman's
Mind right Notions and just Ideas of what
Part he is acting in the World; of what Use he
is, to his native Country; and how to proceed,
so that he may really be of Use to himself,
and not become a Nusance or Offence either
to Poor or Rich.</P>
<P>THERE are some trading Vices too touch'd
at in this Work; which, though in respect
to the general Good, I found necessary to
mention, yet, in respect to the Persons of the
Tradesmen in general, I have touch'd them
but lightly, being willing to act the skilful
Surgeon, and make no deeper <HI>Incisions</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="38"/>
than are absolutely needful, in order to a
Cure.</P>
<P>THE rich Tradesman has his <HI>Faux pas,</HI>
and wrong Steps in his Conduct, as well as
the poor, and the old Standard as well as the
young Beginner; perhaps the latter are not the
easiest to cure, any more than the former; and
yet at the same Time they are not the least
mischevious in their Consequences, but the
more by the Ability of the Persons to do Hurt.</P>
<P>THE Descriptions of the <HI>British</HI> Trade,
judged by the Proportion of its Appendixes,
such as the Taxes that may or have been le∣vy'd
from it, the Expences of Freight and
Carriage of their Goods, as well by Coasting
and Fresh-water Navigation as by Land∣Carriage,
are Things which carry their own
Evidence along with them; and tho' they
may not be so intelligible to those who have
not been long experienced in Trade, and
may not have had Occasion to look criti∣cally
into them, yet the more knowing Part
of the Trading World will see, that some of
the clearest Views of the Magnitude of our
Home Trade may be taken from them that
are any other Way to be had.</P>
<P>IF it be true that the City of <HI>London</HI>
only, besides Coals and Corn, two immense
Articles of Land and Water Carriage, re∣ceives
every Year from the several Counties
of <HI>Cheshire, Wiltshire, Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>War∣wick,</HI>
so many thousand Ton of Cheese,
<PB N="27" REF="39"/>
and so many thousand Firkins of Butter,
besides what comes up in Pots, and so
many thousand Hogsheads of Syder, and the
like Proportion of other Things, the Car∣riage
of which I have spoken of at length in
its Place, what must the Carriage of all
the prodigious Trade in other Things amount
to, most of all the Manufactures of <HI>England</HI>
being brought by Land, and some from
a hundred and fifty to two hundred Miles?
and what must the Return of that Trade it∣self
amount to?</P>
<P>BUT I shall dwell no longer upon gene∣ral
Heads, or make Apologies for any Thing:
I begin with a Satisfaction that I shall need
no Defence for any Thing said in this Book,
and consequently no previous Excuses: 'Tis
aim'd at the publick Good, evidently pur∣sues
it through all its Parts, and will con∣vince
all its Readers of it by the Conse∣quence.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of HONESTY in Trade; how rare to be
found; how necessary for the promoting
Commerce; what Scandal the Tradesmen
generally lie under, about it; and what
the Meaning of it is; and how to be un∣derstood;
with a Word or two to distin∣guish
the Kinds of it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E had occasion to mention some∣thing
of the Honesty requir'd in a
Tradesman in the first Volume of this
Work; but as it had a quite diffe∣rent
View from this, it is meet to make a
farther Enquiry into it.</P>
<P>HONESTY is indeed a nice Article, and is
not easily to be describ'd; 'tis much more talk∣ed
of than understood; more understood than
practis'd; and more practis'd too, than en∣courag'd
or accepted. It is well describ'd
by one Author, to be a nice Plant, that grows
best in a barren Soil, and upon poor Ground;
for where the Soil is rich, and the Land en∣cumber'd
with other Productions, 'tis apt to
be choak'd with the spreading Leaves of
other Plants, or be trod under Foot by the
Workmen that come to take Care of other
Things.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="41"/>
IT does not thrive best, indeed, among
the Money-getting Part of the World, and
therefore it may be, that it is not so culti∣vated
and taken Care of among our Trades∣men
as it might be, and as it were to be
wish'd it had been; in which Case we might
perhaps have had a better Crop: But yet I
may let you see where it is nourish'd too,
with pretty good Success, even in Commerce,
especially among our Home Traders, to
their Honour be it spoken; and 'tis to be
hoped they will encourage others to fair
Dealings too by their Example.</P>
<P>HONESTY, however despicably some speak
of it, and however ragged and forlorn it may
look at present among us, may have a Time
to come in play again; and tho' it seems to
be dropp'd pretty much out of Trade ever
since the Year <HI>Twenty,</HI> when so many honest
Men turn'd K—, and Conscience was
Bubble-ridden and Stock-jobb'd till it came
under PAR, yet Time may come, in spite of
Companies, and Companies of Sharpers, that
<HI>Honesty</HI> may be able to appear upon <HI>Change</HI>
again; whether ever it may in the ALLEY, or
not, I dare not say.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed a great many Preten∣ders
to <HI>Honesty</HI> in the World, and a great ma∣ny
among Tradesmen too, as well as among
other People; and especially those who make
a great Noise with their Honesty, who when
they come to be examined a little more nar∣rowly
<PB N="30" REF="42"/>
into the Particulars, it is easy to disco∣ver
they know nothing of the Matter; and
indeed, 'tis a Rule that seldom fails among
Tradesmen, whether it is the same with
other People, or no, I will not determine,
<HI>viz.</HI> That they have not always the most
<HI>Honesty,</HI> that make the most Noise about it,
who talk most of it, and seem to put the
greatest Value upon it: As it is in Religion,
They have not always the most Assurance of
Salvation, that support their common Affirma∣tives
with that ordinary, tho' extraordinary
Expression, <HI>As I hope to be sav'd;</HI> so they
do not speak most Truth, that are always swea∣ring
by their Troth; nor have they the most
<HI>Honesty</HI> that are always boasting of it: Nay,
if I may advise the Tradesman, I would re∣commend
it to him as a needful Policy, if
it were no more, to leave off swearing and
blasting himself behind the Compter: As to
the Religion of it, that's another Point; I
am not speaking of it at this Time, nor are
all Tradesmen fit to be talk'd to in that Man∣ner.</P>
<P>But
as I am talking to Money-getting
Men, who are pushing their Fortunes, as
I may call it, by Wholesale and Retale, I
would advise them to abate that Part out of
their Shop and Warehouse Rhetorick, upon
this Account, <HI>viz.</HI> That no Body believes them
one Jot the more for it; nor is it any Ad∣vantage
to them in their Busincss, or Credit
to their Character.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="43"/>
AFFIRMING Things in Trade upon the
Faith os such Asseverations, is bearing Wit∣ness
to themselves, and stands for nothing;
and that which is still worse, is, that it is so
often done to support Cheat and Fraud, and
so seldom in Aid of Truth, that it really leaves
the Veracity of the Tradesman much worse
than it found him; and I must needs say,
adds to the general Scandal upon Shop-Keep∣ers,
namely, That whatever they may in
other Places, they are never to be minded
behind the Compter; that tho' you may be∣lieve
what they say in another Place, you are
not to believe what they swear when they are
there; so that 'tis Part of the Art and My∣ftery
of the Profession, to swear and forswear
in the Shop and the Warehouse; and there's
no Sin in it, for they could not live without
it.</P>
<P>HENCE comes that common Saying among
some People, who perhaps want Charity more
than they wont Knowledge, <HI>That all Trades∣men
are Knaves;</HI> and 'tis absolutely neces∣sary
they should be so; that it cannot be
otherwise; that 'tis impossible they should
be honest Men; and if they were not all
Rogues, they would break, and be undone;
they could not live or get their Bread; and
the like.</P>
<P>THIS is a terrible Attack upon the poor
Tradesman; and were it true, no honest Man
would put his Son Apprentice to a Tradesman
<PB N="32" REF="44"/>
upon any Account whatever; for who would
bind his Child to the <HI>Devil?</HI> (for 'tis all
one;) who would put his Son Apprentice
to that which must of consequence carry
him to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and make a Knave of
him unavoidably by the consequence of
that Thing?</P>
<P>THE Tradesmen tell you, indeed, to ex∣cuse
themselves, that 'tis the Consequences
of Trade; that they are not so as Men, or
as in any of their other Conduct, but only
as Tradesmen; that Trade is not to be car∣ried
on without Roguery: A Tradesman
to be honest, say they! 'tis against the Na∣ture
of the Thing: They must lye, and
cheat, and cozen, or they could neither
buy or sell; 'tis a grand essential Part of
Commerce; they that deal with them know
it, and expect it, and indeed are in part the
Reason and Occasion of it; nay, the Buyers
are the Aggressors: Shew a Customer a Piece
of Goods, 'tis natural for them to slight
and disparage them: '<HI>Tis naught, 'tis naught,</HI>
says the Buyer; but when he goes away, he
boasteth. <HI>Solomon,</HI> you see, <HI>blames the Buyer
more than the Seller, or rather than the Seller.</HI></P>
<P>BUYING and Selling, as is observed in
the former Volume, is but a Piece of
Jargon betweeen the Shop-Keeper and the
Customer, giving one another the <HI>Lye</HI> for
half an Hour together, in all the civil Lan∣guage
imaginable: One says 'tis very good,
<PB N="33" REF="45"/>
and the other 'tis very bad; and both Sides
swearing to what they say, 'tis nothing but
<HI>you lye,</HI> and <HI>you lye:</HI> Indeed you lye, <HI>Madam;</HI>
and in Troth you lye, <HI>Sir;</HI> and then they go
on: And there's no buying or selling without
it; in a word, there's no keeping a Shop
open without it: And where is the <HI>Honesty</HI>
of it all the while?</P>
<P>I confess, if this Part were true; I mean,
that there could be no keeping the Shop open
without it, then it would consequently fol∣low,
indeed, as it is alledg'd, and the Tradef∣man
could not be an honest Man; that they
were all K—s and R—s; and that it
could not be otherwise.</P>
<P>BUT Thanks be to Virtue and good Mean∣ing
that Fact is not true; 'tis certainly a Slan∣der
upon a Million of People in this Island,
who, we have Reason to believe, are as honest
as their Neighbours; and I make no Ques∣tion,
but it is as possible for a Tradesman to
be as honest as any other Man, and yet to
carry on his Trade too; and I'll make it ap∣pear
to be so, with allowing all that can be
said to the contrary.</P>
<P>BUT pray take me right, and observe, when
I say <HI>tis possible,</HI> I do not deny but it is
difficult; a Tradesman may be an honest Man,
but I do not say 'tis so easy to him to be so,
as it is for a Man out of Trade; there are
more Snares, more Obstructions in his Way,
and more Allurements to him to turn Knave,
<PB N="34" REF="46"/>
than in any other Employment, that I will
not dispute.</P>
<P>BUT then, the Argument is highly in his
Favour, that as the Difficulty is the greater,
the greater is his Praise, and the greater his
Reward, and, which is to my present Purpose
in particular, the greater is the Value of him
as to Men. An honest Tradesman is a Jewel
indeed, and ought to be valued, and indeed
is valued wherever he is found.</P>
<P>NOR is it the Rarity only which makes
a Tradesman of Integrity be valued so much
among his Neighbours: Besides, perhaps I
am not so much of the Opinion of the Rarity
of them as some are; but that, on the contrary,
there are a great Number. But 'tis the Use∣fulness
ofsuch Tradesman that renders them so
valuable: A Tradesman perfectly and nicely
honest, sincere, and without Guile, is one
of the most useful Things in a Common∣wealth,
and which the Publick stands often
Times in great need of.</P>
<P>AN honest Tradesmen is more capable of
serving his Country, either in a publick or
a private Capacity, than almost any other
Man of the same Figure. He is necessary
on many Occasions to the Government, to
the People, to publick, to private Interests;
and indeed almost to every Body, and to
every Thing.</P>
<P>BUT first let us speak of the Difficulty of
a Tradesman's being honest: He has without
<PB N="35" REF="47"/>
Question more Obstructions to his Honesty,
more Opportunities, and more Importunities
to Knavery, than are more within any other
Station of Life; every Day clandestine Ad∣vantages
of Trade offer themselves to him,
secret Occasions to enrich himself, supplant
his Neighbour, and put a Trick upon the
World, for his private Advantage: The
Wedge of Gold, and the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Gar∣ment
shew themselves every now and then,
as they did to <HI>Achan;</HI> and he has a private
Hint to take them, and hide them among
his Stuff; and 'tis hard for him to resist it.
Here he can over-reach his Customer, there
Bite his Country Manufacturer; this Way he
can impose upon the Rich, there devour the
Poor; and as getting Money by all possible
(fair) Methods is his proper Business, and
what he opens his Shop for, or keep his
Warehouse for, 'tis not the easiest Thing in
the World to distinguish between fair and
foul, when 'tis against himself.</P>
<P>Add to this, that when a Thing something
doubtful happens in his Way, and he has an
Opportunity to get Money, 'tis not very ea∣sy
for him to determine it to be dishonest,
against himself; and a Tradesman may be
too apt to be partial to his own Interest, and
judge in his own Favour.</P>
<P>THIS at least, as it exposes him to the Ha∣zard
of Dishonesty, so he often bears the
<PB N="36" REF="48"/>
Censure of being dishonest when he really
was not so.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, it must be acknowledg'd,
that a Tradesman walks upon the Edge of
the Precipice, and sometimes goes so near
the utmost Brink, that to make a small Slip
is almost unavoidable; and this gives the Oc∣casion
of saying as above, that he cannot be
honest; he is surrounded with others that are
not honest, and they will reproach him to wash
their own Character, and rank him with them∣selves,
if they can: As my Lord <HI>Rochester</HI>
says of the Gamesters, there is no playing
fair among them; if you don't cheat as they
do, they will say you do, and that's the same
Thing, as he says,
<Q><L>If with known Cheats you'll play upon the
Square,</L>
<L>You'll be undone.—</L>
<L>For Honesty's against all common Sense;</L>
<L>Men must be Knaves, 'tis in their own
Defence.</L>
<L>Nor will weak Truth your Reputation
save:</L>
<L>The Knaves will all agree to call you
Knave.</L></Q></P>
<P>IF then you will turn the Words a little,
and instead of saying a Tradesman cannot be
an honest Man, that 'tis impossible he should
be honest, and that all Tradesmen are Knaves,
<PB N="37" REF="49"/>
you will express it thus, That 'tis impossible
for a Tradesman not to be thought a Knave;
or that every Tradesman, or all Tradesmen,
are thougnt Knaves, that is to say, by some
or other; then it can hardly be contradicted.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis the honest Tradesman's Mercy;
that to be a Knave, and to be call'd a Knave
are oftentimes extremely different; a Man
may be under the Power of gross Abuses;
strong Calumny attacks him, and the Knaves
all agree to call him <HI>Knave,</HI> and yet he may
be truly and sincerely honest for all that.</P>
<P>THIS would lead me into a just Exclama∣tion
against the abhorr'd Practice of Calum∣ny,
raising Clamour, and casting Dirt at
the Characters of innocent Men, or taking
Pleasure in blackening Mens Characters for
Trifles, and for small Matters, with the many
other Excursions of the Tongue, loading
Men with Reproach, which they do not
deserve.</P>
<P>IT is indeed an abhorr'd Practice; and yet we
find is so general, that 'tis hard to meet with
a spotless Character; 'tis difficult for a Man
to act so as not to deserve Blame in any
Thing, and much more difficult not to bear
the Reproach of it, whether he deserve it or no.
Tradesmen walk, as I say, on the Brink of Of∣fence;
they must sometimes split a Hair, as 'tis
called, between Innocence and Fault, between
Honest and Dishonest; and who can do this,
<PB N="38" REF="50"/>
and not fall under Reproach on one Side or
on the other.</P>
<P>To be honest, therefore, and to have the
Reputation of it, as I said above, are two
Things, and vastly different from one ano∣ther:
There may be, and I know there are,
a great many Tradesmen that are nicely ho∣nest,
intentionally so, even to Perfection;
for Intentional Honesty may be perfect, what∣ever
actual Honesty may be: I say I know
many are so Intentionally, and <HI>actually too,</HI>
in their utmost Endeavour: But the Knaves
will never cease to call them all <HI>Knaves,</HI> as
well as themselves, and to brand them with
the odious Title, whether just, or no; and
while it is so, how must an honest Man, that
is really so, demean himself? how shall he
be able to walk, and act, and preserve him∣self?</P>
<P>WHEN
I say preserve himself, I must ex∣plain
the Meaning of it a little, or I shall not
be understood. A Tradesman has two Arti∣cles
which are and ought to be his particu∣lar
Care to preserve in the World; and by
preserving them, he preserves himself.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. His Character,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His Property.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>To preserve both together is exceeding
difficult, and sometimes impossible; a cla∣mouring
noisy impertinent Man, but not a
<PB N="39" REF="51"/>
Tradesman, nor of his own Profession, quar∣rels
with him unjustly, abuses, insults him,
I mean in his Business; demands such and
such Things which are not his Due to de∣mand,
or the other Man's Due to pay; the
honest Man is in a Strait; if he yields it,
he gives up his Right, wrongs his Family;
wherefore he insists upon it, and defends him∣self,
and he cannot be honest to himself, if
he does not; this is <HI>preserving his Proper∣ty;</HI>
why then, he is called a Knave, a Cheat,
a Rogue, and <HI>all Tradesmen are the same;</HI>
and thus the general Slander begins.</P>
<P>AGAIN, it is unavoidable but that where
there is such a prodigious Number of Trades∣men,
as there are in this Nation, and such
an infinite Variety of Disputes, and Cases
which happen among them; their Business and
Number, not being to be calculated or expres∣sed,
much less to be guess'd at; I say it is un∣avoidable,
but that there must happen also
abundance of Disputes, Quarrels, Cavils,
and Contentions among them: It is evident
in one particular Case, which I have often ob∣served,
and you will find it so if you enquire
among the Lawyers, <HI>viz.</HI> that when Trade
declines, their Business falls off; and as Trade
revives, <HI>Westminster-Hall</HI> is full of Busi∣ness.</P>
<P>THE
Meaning is plain; the more Trade,
the more Suits at Law: Men differ, dispute,
contend, and appeal to the Law about their
<PB N="40" REF="52"/>
Bargains, Debts, Accounts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then, not
being able to determine Right and Wrong
among themselves, the Lawyers come in
to adjust Things for them: Business is intri∣cate,
and Accidents in Trade numerous, and
full of Niceties, and this appears in their
so frequently quarrelling with one another.</P>
<P>Now 'tis evident, that where two Parties
quarrel, and go to Law, both, generally
speaking, think they are right, and their
Opposer wrong: He that says he suffers
Wrong, fails not to reproach the other with
injurious Language; blames him for Oppres∣sion,
Fraud, Falshood, and the like. In a
word, it seldom happens but that both Sides
call Names, and this of <HI>Knave</HI> principally,
and in the first Place; and where is the
Tradesman that does not both give and re∣ceive
this good Language?</P>
<P>THUS it is owing to the Tradesmen them∣selves
that they obtain the Name of <HI>Knave,</HI>
and Cheat, Injurious, a Plunderer, and in a
word, a dishonest Man: They generally get
it from one another, and they are the first
to reproach one another; so that they have
no Body to blame so much as themselves, for
the Scandal, or rather Slander mentioned
above, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is impossible for a Trades∣man
to be an honest Man.</P>
<P>BUT to bring this Matter, to talk Sense
and Truth both at once, if that be possible,
<HI>and,</HI> as we say proverbially, <HI>to saddle the
<PB N="41" REF="53"/>
right Horse,</HI> the following Particulars will go
a great way in stating the Case fairly be∣tween
the trading World and the rest of
Mankind.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. IT must be granted it requires a great
deal of Care and Circumspection in a
Tradesman to be honest, and to deserve
the Title of an honest Man.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THERE are indeed abundance of Trades∣men
that are not honest Men, and whose
Conduct has assisted very much in rai∣sing
this general Scandal upon all the rest,
<HI>viz. That they cannot be honest.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But yet 'tis very possible, and Exam∣ples
are very frequent in the Case, where
Tradesmen are as strictly and as exactly
honest as any Men can be.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>IT is alledged again by the Enemy, that
true it is, or it may be true rather, that there
are many honest Tradesmen who are honest
in the Language of Trade, and are esteemed
so among their own Sort, that is, among
Tradesmen; but then, say they, that is Ho∣nesty
among Tradesmen, that is not Ho∣nesty
with other Men; and so they enter into
the Merits of the Tradesman's Way of deal∣ing
in all the several Branches of it; and
setting up our Saviour's Rule for a Standard
of Uprightness, they insist upon it, that
there is not an honest Tradesman in <HI>Great
Britain,</HI> namely, who <HI>does by all Men</HI> no∣thing
<PB N="42" REF="54"/>
but as he would <HI>be willing they should
do by him:</HI> 'Tis the Golden Rule, and ought
to be the Standard of a Tradesman's Ma∣nagement
in his Business.</P>
<Q>Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris.</Q>
<P>THIS is a Rule without Spot indeed, a
perfect and unexceptionable Rule, and will
hold for an unalterable Law as long as
there is a Tradesman left in the World;
but it may be said, indeed, Where is the
Man that acts thus? where is the Man whose
spotless Integrity reaches it? who has kept
up to the Height, who has govern'd his Ac∣tions
so regularly, and with such Exactness,
as to say, <HI>All this have I kept from my
Youth?</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, I much question whether that
Man be alive, that can say thus of himself
absolutely; but I cannot doubt in the least
but that there are many Tradesmen that, aba∣ting
human Infirmity, may say, That they
have endeavour'd after such a Perfection;
who if they fall, rise again; if they slip, are
the first to reproach themselves with it; re∣pent,
and re-assume their upright Conduct;
the general Tenor of whose Lives is to be
honest, and to do fair Things. And this is
what we may be allow'd to call <HI>an honest
Man;</HI> for as to Perfection, we are not look∣ing
for it in Life; 'tis enough if it be to be
<PB N="43" REF="55"/>
found in the Intention and Desire: Sincerity of
Desire is Christian Perfection; Heaven will ac∣cept
it for such, and we ought to do so: He that
objects should be sure that he has a greater
Degree of Perfection to produce for himself;
but that is not our Business.</P>
<P>To desire to be honest, is Honesty; because
he that does so, will not fail to endeavour,
by all possible Means, to act honestly in
every Thing he does; if not, he will give
but very slender Testimony of the Sincerity
of his honest Wishes.</P>
<P>Now let a Tradesman's Difficulties be as
great as they will, be his Snares as many as
are reasonably to be supposed; be the Impor∣tunities
of his Advantage how great soever,
yet he may both sincerely desire, and endea∣your
to act honestly in every Thing: And
he that does so, and who, if he slips at any
Time, both repents and reforms, re-affumes
his Resolutions to do honestly, and to make
Reparations where he has done Wrong, that
Man should pass for an honest Man with
me, as long as I have any Reason or Rule to
judge of an honest Man by.</P>
<Q><L>He that repents, and does his Crimes amend,</L>
<L>Stands next to him, that never did offend.</L></Q>
<P>AND why is it not to be allowed to a
Tradesman to repent, and reform: This would
not only shut half the World out of our own
<PB N="44" REF="56"/>
good Opinion, but would lock them out of
Heaven too. If it were true, that a Tradesman
could not be an honest Man, and could not
reform or repent, we might e'en say of them,
as the Disciples said to our Saviour about the
rich Men, <HI>Who then can be sav'd?</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, this would be a Step to make all
the Tradesmen be, what you talk them up to
be; to make them Desperadoes; and seeing
that by Profession they must be K—s,
make them conclude, they can be no other,
and so make them resolve to be as bad as they
can. If you once persuade a Man that he
can never be honest, you open the Door to
him never to endeavour it.</P>
<P>BUT why may not a Tradesman be honest?
Is it because he endeavours to sell his Goods
as dear as he can, and to buy his Goods as
cheap as he can? I see no room to make out
the Charge upon that Foot, if he does not
yield to some dishonest Means, to persuade
the Buyer to think a Thing to be what it is
not. Now how far the Seller of the Goods
is bound to discover every Thing in the Goods
he sells that may be to its Disadvantage, any
more than he is to conceal any Thing that
may be to its Advantage, is a Point not yet
settled in the World, nor perhaps ever will
be.</P>
<P>NOR are the Bounds and Limits of Ho∣nesty
strictly settled betwixt the Buyer and
Seller. How far the former may recommend
<PB N="45" REF="57"/>
his Goods; how far the latter may decry
and disparage them; how far the Seller
(Tradesman) may set them off with Flourishes
and Rhetorick; and what Art he may use to
persuade the Customer to buy; and how far
the Customer may strive and struggle with
the Tradesman, by running down the Good∣ness
of his Goods, and lessening the Value
of them, in order to bring him to abate.</P>
<P>THE Limits between these two, I say,
are not settled with respect to their Honesty
or Dishonesty; and so it remains a Difficulty,
how far the Tradesman is to be censur'd on
that Account; but then I must add too, that
if it be upon this Foot that the Tradesman
is censur'd as dishonest, and that all Trades∣men
that practise the Art of setting off their
Goods by the Help of Words are Knaves,
then I must add, that all Buyers, who with
<HI>Solomon</HI>'s Chap says, <HI>'Tis Naught, 'tis
Naught;</HI> that is to say, endeavours to depre∣ciate
and run down the Goods he buys by
the Help of the same Artifice, is a Knave
too, and that as much as the Tradesman;
and so we shall bring almost all Mankind in∣to
the Charge; and it will not be true only that
the Tradesman cannot be honest, but in Fact,
no Man that has any Thing to do in the
World with the Poor, or with the Rich, with
the Buyer or with the Seller, with a Labour∣er,
or the Master, with one or with another,
can be honest. But we are all K—<HI>s,</HI> and
<PB N="46" REF="58"/>
the Sons of K—<HI>s,</HI> Man and Mother's
Child; not an honest Wretch left on the Face
of God's Globe, no, not one.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is carrying the Charge too
far, running up Things too high; and you
have, like DAVID in another Case, <HI>said in your
Haste, that all Men are Lyars:</HI> And on the
other Hand, I must in Vindication of the
Tradesmen of this Nation say two or three
Things of them:</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> They are, generally speaking, fair
Traders and punctual honest Dealers; there
may be Sharpers and double-dealing Knaves
among them, but generally speaking, there
is a Face of Honesty upon the whole
Body.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I believe it may be said of them
without boasting, or without Partiality, that
they are rather honester and fairer in their
Dealings here, than other Nations, I mean
than other trading Nations.</P>
<P>I think I may venture to say, 'tis a Proof
of this, that I observe there is greater per∣sonal
Credit given in Trade in this Nation,
<HI>that is,</HI> Men are more trusted upon their
Words, upon their Honesty, than in any
other Nation in the World.</P>
<P>IF you were to trust a <HI>Russian</HI> in <HI>Muscovy</HI>
upon his Parole, he would not only cheat
you, but would boast of it the next Day,
laugh in your Face, and ask you how you
came to be such a Fool to trust him: If you
<PB N="47" REF="59"/>
part with your Goods to any of the wander∣ing
Dealers of the Eastern World, without
the Effects to be exchang'd secur'd in your
Hands, you may expect to hear no more of
them.</P>
<P>IN <HI>France</HI> and in <HI>Italy</HI> Men trade with the
utmost Jealousy and Caution; and except it
is among the Merchants and Men of great
Dealing, and establish'd Reputation in Busi∣ness,
you see very little fair punctual Dealing
among the meaner People.</P>
<P>BUT in <HI>England</HI> a Man sells his Goods up∣on
Trust, and delivers them to an ordinary
Shop-Keeper or Retailer, and that to a con∣siderable
Quantity and Value, with the
greatest Tranquility and Ease of Mind in the
World, and has as punctual and honest Deal∣ing,
as if he had a Bond and Security for
Payment; and a Warehouse-Keeper sleeps as
easy, that has six or seven thousand Pounds
owing him among the Country Tradesmen
and Shop-Keepers, upon the meer Credit of
their Words, being what we call a Book-Debt:
I say, he sleeps as easy, tho' his whole
Fortune lies thus dispers'd, perhaps in all the
principal Towns in <HI>England,</HI> or most of them,
as if it was all in Cash, in the Bank, or laid
out in Land, and in his full Possession.</P>
<P>THIS is the Fruit of the Tradesman's Ho∣nesty;
fair and just Dealing raises Credit,
and for ought I see, is the only Foundation
upon which Credit in Trade is rais'd; and if
<PB N="48" REF="60"/>
so, as the <HI>English</HI> Credit in Trade, is the
greatest in the World at this Time, I mean
in their home Trade, it is no unjust Inference
to draw from it, that their Honesty is in Pro∣portion
greatest also. But I shall have occa∣sion
to speak of this again in its Course.</P>
<P>I return to the Description of this nice
Article call'd Honesty, as it respects Trade,
as I said before; the Limits of it are not
duly settled, and we have not set up a stated
Rule to judge it by. Hence we are frequent∣ly
wrangling about it, and every Day cal∣ling
Truth Falshood, and Justice Knavery;
while on the other Hand, the K—calls
himself an honest Man, and the greatest
Frauds are carried on under a Mask of the
utmost Nicety. Hypocrisy is cover'd with
a Habit or Dress, resembling Honesty, as a
Whore puts on the Habit of a <HI>Nun</HI> at the
<HI>Ball,</HI> and covers the <HI>Courtesan</HI> with the <HI>Re∣ligieuse.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Honesty,</HI>
like Silver, should have a Stan∣dard
for the Essay; and then should receive
a Stamp of Current upon it, as the Silver
does that of a Coinage; after which there
would be no room to question it: But if
any one doubted, the Touch would deter∣mine
its Quality to be Sterling. It is indeed
very injurious to the World, that this is not
done; tho' how to bring it about is something
difficult; for there are a great many Sorts of
Honesty in the World, as well of the right
<PB N="49" REF="61"/>
true Honesty, as of the pretended or coun∣terfeit
Honesty.</P>
<Q>1. As I observ'd before, there are several
Degrees of Honesty, and several kinds
of it, even of what we call true Ho∣nesty,
as there is Silver of a coarser
or finer kind, some of one Country,
some of another; for Example, they
tell us of several Kinds of Honesty,
even here at home, such as <HI>Yorkshire</HI>
Honesty, for Example; which, however,
some People, who call themselves good
Judges too, don't care to take for Stan∣dard
Honesty, and yet when you come
into <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> they tell you, their Coun∣try
Honesty is of the finest Kind in the
World, and that it is farther North that
the counterfeit Honesty grows; and tho'
I have been far North too, yet I don't
find, but their Honesty is as good as
other People's, and other People's Kna∣very
as bad as theirs; for Honesty, in a
Word, is Honesty, let it grow where it
will, and let People set up what they
will for Honesty, yet the Counter∣feit
will discover it self wherever it is
found.</Q>
<P>THUS in some Part of the World, Cun∣ning
is call'd Honesty, and passes Current
too, without any considerable Exception;
<PB N="50" REF="62"/>
and which is more wonderful, there is a
Country not far off, neither where they take
Simplicity for Honesty, and Men pass for
honest, because they are Fools; which Ho∣nesty,
by the way, like the old brass Far∣things,
will go but a very little Way from
Home, and if it comes abroad among People
where their Honesty is true Sterling, it is
presently discover'd.</P>
<P>THERE is another kind of <HI>Honesty,</HI> which
they call <HI>New-England Honesty,</HI> and which
they say, is the most dangerous of any of
the Counterfeits. But I cannot see that it
has done any great Harm in the World; which
some malicious People intimate is, because
they keep it at Home pretty much; and that
they say is, because it is known, and so will
not pass abroad: But of that I have no Room
to discourse fully in this Work, neither is it
to my Purpose. If our Friends in <HI>New-England</HI>
have been imposed upon, and a coun∣terfeit
Honesty has been introduc'd, and
made to pass for Current Honesty among
them, I doubt not but they will call it into
their Mint, and recoin it; and then, without
Doubt, it will come out as good Standard,
Current Honesty as ours is in <HI>Europe;</HI> so pray,
Gentlemen before we examine other People's
Honesty too far, let us take Care of our
own.</P>
<P>THERE is, as I have said, a great Variety
in the kinds of Honesty among our selves;
<PB N="51" REF="63"/>
and this is that which touches the Point that
I am upon. For when I insist, that there is a
kind of Honesty in our Dealings, and in Trade,
and that a Tradesman may be an honest Man as
above, I am presently answered in this gibing
Way: Yes, you Tradesmen may have some Ho∣nesty;
but then that passes for Honesty among
you, which is not Honesty with other Men; for
Example, say they, lying, and cheating, set∣ting
off bad Goods for good, damag'd and
unfinished for merchantable, and the like;
this is call'd Honesty behind the Compter,
but is not so any where else; nor will the
Tradesman call it so in any but himself; ex∣cusing
his own Practice, with this very ordinary
and coarse Plea, <HI>viz. That he cannot help it;</HI>
he cannot carry on his Trade without it;
which last we grant to be true, say they, and
therefore add, that a Tradesman cannot be
an honest Man; he must be a K—by Vir∣tue
of his Business; <HI>he cannot help it.</HI></P>
<P>BUT all this is answered in this General,
by telling you, that 'tis a vulgar Error; that
the Tradesmen must be distinguish'd, as the
rest of the World are, into honest and disho∣nest;
that perhaps there are Men who thus
plead the Necessity of their Business for it; but
that on the other Hand, there are Men that
do not act thus, nor do they find any Ne∣cessity
for it; but can, and do carry on their
Trades very well without it, and thereby wit∣ness
that others might do so too.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="64"/>
THIS <HI>Honesty</HI> then consists in a general Pro∣bity
of Conduct; punctual keeping their Word,
making the Honour of Trade, (as it is call'd,)
be their Guide, and their Word be equal to
their Bond in all Cases. I knew a Trades∣man
that was never sued at Law by any Bo∣dy,
and yet carried on a very considerable
Business in <HI>London</HI> for almost fifty Years,
having no Quarrel in Trade with any Man;
if he had any considerable Debt owing him,
that he could not get in, he used such Forbear∣ance
and Lenity with others, that he never
arrested any Man in his Life. It is true, he
might be a Loser by that Part, and was so;
but that was a Damage only to himself: But
he preserv'd the Character of an honest and
an upright Dealer to the last, and really de∣serv'd
it, for he was so; and no Doubt,
there are many more such; and therefore the
Reproach, that a Tradesman cannot be an
honest Man is a Slander, and no other; and
there I shall leave it.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the needful Capacities of a compleat
Tradesman; that he need not be a Scholar,
yet should not be a Dunce; that he need
not be a Wit, yet should not be a Fool;
that a competent Degree of Knowledge is
necessary to his Business; and although
that too much may rather make him too
enterprizing, or too indolent, yet the Di∣rection
of Business requires, that a
Tradesman should be a Man of good Sense,
a Man of Understanding and Judg∣ment.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>IS an odd Saying, as well as said in
an odd (antient) Style, that a <HI>Trades∣man</HI>
should have <HI>Mother-Wit,</HI> but
no <HI>Clergy:</HI> I differ exceedingly
from my Forefathers in that Point; a Fool
may make a Fiddler, but he will make an
ill Shop-Keeper; the Tradesman must be a
Man of Sense, or he will never be a Man of
Business.</P>
<P>BY a Fool here I would be understood
as <HI>I mean,</HI> not as <HI>I speak;</HI> that is to say,
not in the Letter; I don't mean an Idiot, a
<PB N="54" REF="66"/>
Driveler, a meer natural Fool; but an un∣taught,
illiterate, shallow-headed Fellow,
who we ordinarily call a Fool; and even
such the Tradesmen should not be, if it be
possible to help or avoid it.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Tradesman, I say, should be
a Man of Sense; what if it is not absolutely
necessary he should be what we call a Man
of Parts? He should, nay, he must, have
Knowledge competent to his Business. As to
Learning, it is not absolutely necessary he
should understand <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin;</HI> but
'tis absolutely necessary he should understand
Trade and Business: Tho' he need not be
a Man of Letters, he ought to be a Man
of Figures; as a Carpenter need not under∣stand
Mr. <HI>Whiston</HI>'s Astronomical Tables,
yet he ought to be Master of <HI>Gunter's Scale,</HI>
and know how to measure by his Rule and
his Compass.</P>
<P>THERE are many Studies as remote from
a Tradesman as the <HI>Greek Grammar</HI> is from
the <HI>English Primmer;</HI> but it does not fol∣low,
therefore, that the Tradesman must
know nothing but his Weights and Mea∣sures:
As I say in my Title, he need not
be a <HI>Wit,</HI> but he should not be a <HI>Dunce:</HI>
He need not be a Poet or a Pedant; but he
should not be a dull sleepy Thing, that has
no Genius to any Thing, but just what he
has before him; he should have some Spirit
and Life in his Business.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="67"/>
THERE are <HI>thin-headed</HI> Fellows, who
are all Flutter and Fancy, that are too vo∣latile
for a Shop or Warehouse, and ase fit∣ter
for Dancing Masters than Tradesmen;
and there are <HI>thick-headed</HI> Fellows on the
other hand, who must have every Thing
beaten into them, as Men cleave Blocks, with
Beetle and Wedges.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Tradesman is the Middle
among these Extremes; he knows more
than he has an immediate Use for, and is
capable of learning more than he knows;
he loves Knowledge enough to make him
seek it, and knows he wants it enough to
make him love it; he has Knowledge enough
to make him diligent, and not so much as
to make him loose and aspiring.</P>
<P>ONE of the best Parts of Knowledge the
Tradesman in good Business can have, is to
know <HI>when he is well;</HI> be contented to go
on where he is, keep the Road, not strag∣gling
into unknown By-paths of Trade,
which he has never travelled in before, and
where he does not know the Way in, or the
Way out, but may be lost before he can
look round him. Over much searching after
more Business, when he has enough already,
grasping when he has his Hands full, and
hatching more, when he is as full as he can
hold, is a trading Evil, and generally is fa∣tal
to the Tradesmen; 'tis like a Sow bring∣ing
forth more Pigs than she can suckle, or
<PB N="56" REF="68"/>
a Hen laying more Eggs than she can
cover.</P>
<P>THE ploding fair-driving Tradesman, that
goes on safe and sure, and is always mo∣ving;
he, I say, is the Man that bids fairest
to be rich: The Coach and the Chariot gal∣lop,
and drive, and the Posts whip and spur;
but the Plowman and the Carrier go soft
and fair, and yet the last come with the
greatest Certainty to the End of their Jour∣ney,
and draw or carry the greatest Burden.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> Carriage, which we use in
drawing the greatest Burdens or Loads, I
mean such as draw Timber, and are, in our
modern Usage, call'd a Wain or Carriage,
are in <HI>Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex</HI> called a <HI>Tug,</HI> from
the old <HI>Saxon</HI> Language, signifying Hard
Labour; and the <HI>Waggon</HI> has its Deriva∣tion
from the same Language, wherein the
Words are usually expressive of the Manner
or Thing which they are used for; as the
<HI>Waggon</HI> is a Carriage, which being heavy
loaden, does but just WAG ON; but still
'tis observ'd, it keeps wagging, and it al∣ways
goes on; and as softly as it goes, we
see some of our Carriers come as far as from
<HI>Exeter,</HI> a hundred and fifty Miles to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
with forty to fifty Hundred Weight, and
make their Journeys constantly, wet or dry,
dark or light, blow high, blow low, still,
according to their true original Name, and
the Meaning of it, they WAG ON.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="69"/>
THUS the prudent Tradesman, that goes
on carefully and gently, lets no Irons burn,
and yet lets no Irons cool; he truly drives
his Trade, but does not push it; keeps it
going, but does not over-run it; keeps
in his own Orbit, and within the Circle of
his own diurnal Revolution: This is in a Word
the Compleat Tradesman.</P>
<P>Now, as I said, this Tradesman should
neither be a Wit or a Fool: My Reason is
this; I do not think a Man can have too
much Wit, let his Calling or Employment
be what it will, provided there is a due
Weight of Judgment and Experience to
ballance this Wit; for there is a manifest
Difference between Wit and Judgment, not
in the Nature of them only, but in their
Operation also; and indeed, they will nei∣ther
of them be able to shew their Value
alone. Like <HI>Spanish</HI> Wool in the <HI>English</HI> Ma∣nufacture,
they are too fine to work by
themselves; and, as Silver, is too brittle to
work without its Aloy: There must be a
Mixture of Judgment to keep the Wit solid.</P>
<Q><L>Wit, without Sense, is like the laughing Evil,</L>
<L>While Sense unmix'd with Fancy, is the Devil.</L></Q>
<P>WIT, like Mercury and Quicksilver, is
of Use to make the Silver Ore run, and se∣parate
the Sterling from the Dross; but
bring it to the Crucible by itself, it flies up
<PB N="58" REF="70"/>
into the Air, like a true Spirit, and is lost
at once, and who can fix it again after∣wards.</P>
<P>A Wit, turn'd Tradesman! what an in∣congruous
Part of Nature is there brought
together, consisting of direct Contraries?
No Apron Strings will hold him; 'tis in
vain to lock him in behind the Compter,
he's gone in a Moment; instead of Journal
and Ledger, he runs away to his <HI>Virgil</HI>
and <HI>Horace;</HI> his Journal Entries are all
Pindaricks, and his Ledger is all Heroicks;
he is truly dramatick from one End to the
other, through the whole Scene of his
Trade; and as the first Part is all Comedy,
so the two last Acts are always made up with
Tragedy; a Statute of Bankrupt is his <HI>Exeunt
omnes,</HI> and he generally speaks the Epilogue
in the <HI>Fleet Prison</HI> or the <HI>Mint.</HI> Again,
take the Fool-Tradesman, the thick-headed
Wretch, that has nothing bright about him;
no Genius neither for one or other; he
should have been the Manufacturer, not
the Factor; he should have stood by the
Shuttle and the Warping-Mill, not come to
the Buying and Selling; indeed he is a
kind of a natural Mechanick, <HI>viz.</HI> Nature
cut him out to be a meer Mechanick, not a
Tradesman; to make the Work, not buy
and sell it; and he is out of his Element
when he is out of the Loom.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="71"/>
INDEED, when you see him in the Shop
or the Warehouse, he seems to be a little like
the Shuttle that the Weaver throws backward
and sorward, he is ever going just the same
Pace, and keeps the same soad: This backward
and forward is the only Motion, for ought
I know, in all Natures Engines, that is not
circular; 'tis the Pendulum of the Manu∣facture,
which regulates and measures the
rest of its Motions, and makes all the circu∣lar
Motions be exact.</P>
<P>THIS Man is no more fit for a Tradesman
than the fluttering Shuttlecock-Tradesman
mentioned above as a Wit: If the Tradesman
is a Man of Wit, a Man of bright Thoughts,
has a Touring Fancy, a Profusion of polite Ideas,
let him make it his Business to keep all those
fine Parts of Nature's Imagery within Bounds;
let him make use of them like fine Paint∣ings,
to be hanged up in his Hall, and grace
the Entrance; let him garnish his Soul with
them as much as he pleases, and shew them
as much as he finds Occasion, but not take
them down, and displace them.</P>
<P>THE finest Accomplishments of Nature
may do the Tradesman no Harm, if he can
keep this Magazine of Gunpowder from the
Fire; but if he brings the Candle to it, or
brings the Powder to the Candle, he is gone,
he is sure to be blown up: Pictures taken
down from the Wall, and set one before
another, with their painted Sides inward,
<PB N="60" REF="72"/>
are the worst Furniture in the House, and
like a fine brocaded Silk, are beautiful on one
Side, but all Rags and Ends on the other.</P>
<P>THE Brightness of the Tradesman's Head,
the Clearness of his Thought, the Eleva∣tion
of his Fancy, they are all <HI>out-of-the∣way
Things</HI> to the poor Man in his Business,
and serve only to set him up in a Station
above himself; make him fancy himself fra∣med
by Nature for other Things than the
Compter or the Compting-House; and so
set his Pride a tip-toe, bloating it up into
Conceit; and thus the Man is undone.</P>
<P>THE first and worst Mischief that can at∣tend
a Tradesman is Conceit of his own
Worth: Such a Man fancies the World is
ill-sorted with him, that he is under-rated
among Mankind; that Nature design'd him
for something above what he is, and his
Father made a wrong Judgment of him
when he put him to a Trade: He should
have been sent to the University when he
was put Apprentice, and should have had a
Company in the Guards when he set up Shop∣keeping;
that then he had been something
in the World like himself, and been fit
Company for Gentlemen, and the like; or
should have been put to the Law, and made
a Counsellor.</P>
<P>LET the Tradesman once have but his Head
full of these Things, and he is a lost Man:
From that Hour he takes out a Commission of
<PB N="61" REF="73"/>
Bankrupt against himself by the very Notion
of it; he can do nothing ever after, but read
News, go abroad to see Shows, Masque∣rades,
and Opera's: If War is upon the Anvil,
he wishes himself in the Field, and thinks
himself qualified to be every Thing that he
sees other Men arrive at.</P>
<P>D—it, said a good substantial Chim∣ney-Sweeper,
that I knew, if my Father had
had the least Understanding, how to suit the
Employments he put his Children to, with
the Genius and Inclinations of his Sons, he
would have made my Brother <HI>Tom</HI> a Chim∣ney-Sweeper,
not me: I should have been
bred to the Sea, or sent into the Army: I,
that knew how to deserve, and had Sense and
Parts to recommend myself, I should have
been an Admiral by this Time, or a General
Officer, and shewn my Understanding in a
Council of War: I should have let the World
know that I had good Blood in my Veins,
and that my Ancestors, tho' buried in Obli∣vion
by the Injuries of Time, were cer∣tainly
something considerable; and that their
Virtue and Gallantry should revive in their
Posterity, though their Families could not
be distinguish'd by the Heralds. Upon
this the puff'd-up Mortal laid by his black
Cloaths and his Truncheon, went into the
Army, got maim'd with a Shot in his Hand,
and the next News I had of him was, that
I saw him a begging.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="74"/>
AMBITION and aspiring Thought are
Plagues and Diseases to a Tradesman: When
they work in his Mind, his Friends should
get his Head shav'd, and put him into a
dark House for a little while, administring
proper Physick to him, to keep him from the
Vapours; and that the Cure might be wrought
upon his Understanding, it should be first
wrought upon his Body, for the desir'd Ef∣fect.</P>
<P>THE
Tradesman should be wise rather
than witty; he should be as wise as he can
in his Business; and though he passes for <HI>no
Body</HI> among the Beaus, and Wits of the
Town, Nature's Weather-Cocks, and the
Froth and Flutter of the Creation, he will
be <HI>some Body</HI> in his own Way, and build
upon a Foundation, that his Posterity may
have Room to value themselves upon;
and if he cannot be a Gentleman, he may
be able to buy a Gentleman, and that's
enough to him.</P>
<P>BUSINESS is a Thing suited to a ftaid
Head; it does not require the polite Part
of human Understanding, or call for a li∣beral
Education; and it is the Tradesman's
Mercy that it is so: But at the same Time
he knows little of Business, who thinks a
Tradesman may be a Fool, an Idiot, or a
Natural.</P>
<P>IT is a poor Pittance of human Nature,
that these Men will allow to a Tradesman,
<PB N="63" REF="75"/>
that they will allow him neither Sense or
Honesty; that he need not be a wise Man,
and is bound to be a K—; that he needs
no Wit, and can have no Honour: But such
Men forget that the Honesty and the Wit
are Assistants to one another, and that the
Tradesman that is a K—, is generally so
for want of Sense: I do confess 'tis very
hard for the Fool-Tradesman to be an ho∣nest
Man, and there I believe the Scandal
began; but if he is a Man of Sense, that
Sense is the Protection of his Principles,
and he is honest because he is wise, as he is
rich because he is diligent.</P>
<P>I have heard somejudicious People say from
their Judgment of Nature, and I join exactly
with their Opinion, that a Fool and a Coward
can never be an honest Man; the Reasons they
give are too many, and too philosophical to
enter upon here: But you may take them
in the Gross.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A Fool cannot be an honest Man, be∣cause
he does not understand it; he does
not know what Honesty is, when he
goes beyond the Limits of it, and when
not; what is litterally honest, and what
is constructively so; what Honesty im∣plies,
and what it contains; in a Word,
he does not know where Honesty ends,
and Knavery begins, or where the Ex∣tremes
of them join. How sould a
<PB N="64" REF="76"/>
Man be honest, strictly honest, that does
not know when he is so? and when he
is not, when he does right and when he
does wrong? One Way he is honest to
his own Loss and Disadvantage, for
fear of being a Knave; another Way
he is a Knave, by the meer Folly and
Weakness of his Head, and when he does
not design it? and all because he does not
know it, and consequently does not
know how to shun and avoid it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A Coward cannot be honest, because
when Difficulties and Hazards, Quarrels
and Dangers happen, and his Way
seems to be hedg'd up with Thorns,
the Man sinks with the Terror of
it, and has not Courage to be honest;
he cannot <HI>Dare,</HI> he cannot hold up
his Head against Danger, or his Heart
against Power; he may be threatened
and frighted into an ill Thing, though
it is not willingly; and though he is not
a Knave in Choice, he will be so for
fear; he cannot be otherwise.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THERE is a great Deal more of this kind
to be said for it, under both those Heads;
and the poor Tradesman has too many attend∣ing
Circumstances which break in upon his
Morality, and, as it were, force him to
intrench, and break the Bounds of Con∣science.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="77"/>
WELL may it be said, that a Tradesman
should not be a Fool, if a Fool cannot be
an honest Man: The Tradesman that wants
a Head, wants the Essential of his Charac∣ter,
he is neither fit to be a Chriftian, or to
be a Tradesman; a Fool is not qualified for
this World, or for another; he is a K—because
he is a Fool, and knows not how to
be honest; and he is still the more a Fool,
because he stoops to be a K—; in a word,
he is an unhappy Creature, and unhappily
embarrassed in the absolute Necessity of being
both wicked and simple together.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman therefore must not be a
Fool; it entangles him in the most miserable
Circumstances of Life, and brings him into
the Necessity of acting in a Manner that does
not consist with that Reputation, so essen∣tial
to a Tradesman; a solid Quantity of
good Sense, no Pride, (no Flutter, no Fop,)
Sense and Wit consolidated, mix'd in due
Proportions, and suited to the main End of
Life: These are the Qualifications needful to
a Compleat Tradesman.</P>
<P>THERE are a certain sort of People, often
found among Tradesmen, that are in the
middle State between these two above∣named;
I mean K—and F—, and
who yet we take to be properly of neither of
the two Species; and these we call <HI>Cunning
Men;</HI> a kind of shrewd designing Men, that
are always studying to be what they call
<PB N="66" REF="78"/>
sharp; that never think they do any Thing,
if they do not act beyond every Body, and
if they do not circumvent every Body they
deal with.</P>
<P>THESE Cunning Men will find it a very
hard Matter support the Credit of their Ho∣nisty,
or to make a good Claim to the Title
of it. Honesty and Cunning are a different
Species. I have heard of a kind of North∣Country
Double-faced Honesty, which is
little better than meer Craft; but it will ne∣ver
stand the Test, it will never pass for
Honesty among Men of simple well-mean∣ing
Principles.</P>
<P>A Tradesman should be wise as the Ser∣pent,
but he should be innocent, that is,
<HI>Honest</HI> too as the Dove; he should have the
Wisdom of the Serpent, but not the Cun∣ning,
the Craft, the Sharping, the Biting of
the Serpent; he should be wise and honest,
and if he is truly wise, he must be honest;
Wisdom is a Part of his Honesty, as it is es∣sential
to it.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Tradesman must be a wise
Man; and yet, as I said, he need not be a
Wit: He should be a Man wise in his Busi∣ness,
wise in his Way, and that Wisdom is
enough to him: He should be wise as a
Tradesman. And I think it would not be amiss
to explain my self a little upon that Subject,
for the Wisdom of a Tradesman has many
effential Things in it, which yet do not qua∣lify
<PB N="67" REF="79"/>
him for the Wisdom of any other Species,
or to pass for a Wit in the World.</P>
<Q>1. He must be wise and wary; wise enough
not to be cheated and impos'd upon,
ruin'd, and undone by others: This is a
Wisdom, which however it maybe said to
be of a meaner Kind, and that the Brutes
are acknowledged to be very much
Masters of it; yet it is absolutely ne∣cessary
to be found in a Man embark'd
in Business: The World is full of
Craft and Subtilty, Sharping and Bi∣ting;
and if the Tradesman be honest,
and not wary; if he is what we call a
weak Man, he is in the utmost Danger
of being undone. 'Tis very hard,
yet so it is, that the Honesty in that
Case is a Disaster to him, that is to
say, the want of being sharp in his
Business makes his Principle of Ho∣nesty
dangerous to him; he is not able
to prevent Frauds upon himself, for
want of Sagacity, and a due Share of
Understanding, and he cannot return
Sharping for Sharping; and so his Ho∣nesty
not being fortified by his Wit, and
the Heart not assisted by the Head, he
falls a Prey to the first cunning sharping
Knave, that he happens to be dealing
with.</Q>
<P><PB N="68" REF="80"/>
THERE is a memorable Story well known
in the Place where it was transacted, which
is so directly to this Purpose, that tho' it re∣lates
to an Affair in foreign Commerce, yet
I cannot think it out of Course in this
Place.</P>
<P>A certain <HI>English</HI> Merchant in <HI>Asia,</HI> having
a large Parcel of <HI>English</HI> Cloths to sell, an
<HI>Armeian</HI> Merchant comes to see them: He
brings with him a <HI>Jew,</HI> who was a Broker
between them, and which is usual in these
Countries, to make the Bargain, and to fix the
Price; all which, to shorten the Story, was
done to his Mind. But the main Question
was about Payment.</P>
<P>THE Merchant enquired of the <HI>Jew</HI> about
the Character of his <HI>Armenian</HI> Customer;
and he, pretending to be very impartial, an∣swer'd
coldly, That he could say nothing to
that, only that he believed him to be very
honest, and also able; that he had a great
Parcel of Goods, such as Bales of Silk,
and Sacks of Gaul to sell; and that he sup∣posed
he might either have them in Ex∣change
for his Cloths; but added, that he
could say little.</P>
<P>THE Merchant was not satisfied with that
Account, because the <HI>Armenian</HI> insisted up∣on
twenty Days Time for the disposing his
Goods, and that then he would pay in Mo∣ney;
and did not offer his own Goods in imme∣diate
Exchange; so they parted.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="81"/>
A few Days after, the <HI>Armenian</HI> finds
Means, by the Help of the same <HI>Jew,</HI> to
get ten Bales, that is to say, a hundred Cloths
into his Warehouse, belonging either to the
<HI>Jew</HI> himself, or some other Person, for
which it seems the <HI>Armenian</HI> had either made
Payment, or given Pledge for the returning
them.</P>
<P>AFTER this the knavish <HI>Jew</HI> takes an
Occasion to bring the Merchant to the
<HI>Armenian</HI>'s Chamber or Room in the <HI>Cara∣vansera,</HI>
or Inn, and there he sees ten Bales
of <HI>English</HI> Cloth: Upon this he concludes
the <HI>Jew</HI> had trick'd him, and had spoken in∣differently
of the <HI>Armenian,</HI> on Purpose to
sell another Merchant Goods, and hinder
him; and asking the <HI>Jew</HI> the Meaning of
it, he told him, they were such a Merchant's
Bales, naming some Merchant that was
gone away from the Place at that Time, for
about three Weeks; so that he could not en∣quire
of him, and that he had trusted the
<HI>Armenian</HI> very readily with those hundred
Cloths, knowing him to be a very honest
Man,</P>
<P>UPON this the Merchant solicites the <HI>Ar∣menian</HI>
again to buy, who appeared back∣ward,
play'd off, and said he was now sup∣plied,
and had almost enough; but at last
suffer'd himself to be prevail'd with by the
<HI>Jew,</HI> who was a Confederate, to take the
Goods; and the honest weak Merchant per∣fectly
<PB N="70" REF="82"/>
deluded, concludes the Bargain, being
10th to lose the Opportunity of selling the
Goods.</P>
<P>THE next Day the Goods are delivered to
the Value of 3000 <HI>l.</HI> or upwards, in three Days
more, being but two Days before Payment
was to be made, the <HI>Armenian</HI> disappeared,
and the <HI>Jew</HI> also; and the poor deceived
Merchant was ruined and undone.</P>
<P>A Tradesman, tho' he need neither be
Poet or Politician, should yet have so much
Wit, or whatever you please to call it, not to
be cheated thus; so much Capacity as to bear
up against Fraud, and deal with a <HI>Jew:</HI>
And this is absolutely necessary for his own
Safety; for without this the Tradesman is
never secure; and he that is not sufficiently
stored in the Head, to defend himself against
such Things as these, is not qualified to be a
Tradesman; such a Man should be put Ap∣prentice
to some Handicraft, or should be
sent to <HI>Bedlam,</HI> rather than to be plac'd
in a Compting-House, or behind the Comp∣ter.</P>
<P>THEY are therefore much deceived, that
think Men of the meanest Capacities only are
qualified to be Tradesmen: Though the
Tradesman, as I have said, need not be a
polite finish'd Genius, tho' he need not be
a Poet, a Scholar, a Statesman, yet he should
be a Man of Sense; one that understands his
Business in general, that knows something
<PB N="71" REF="83"/>
of the World, and how to deal with Man∣kind;
not a Novice, that may be made a
Tool of, and be cheated by every Shar∣per.</P>
<P>I have hinted in the former Volume, that
it is absolutely necessary a Tradesman should
understand the Goods he deals in; and it is
absolutely necessary, indeed; but I must add,
there is a general Understanding also needful
to the Tradesman, which goes beyond the par∣ticular
Part; that is, he should be a Man of
Understanding as a Tradesman; it is in ge∣neral
expressed by that common but signifi∣cant
Term, a Man of Business, a Man ac∣quainted
with Business in general, that knows
the ordinary Rules of Dealings in the World,
and how an honest Man should act in all
Cases; one that, tho' he is in himself an honest
Man, will not be at a Loss how to deal with
Knaves, <HI>Jews,</HI> and Sharpers; that is to say,
not how to deal with them in their own Way,
but how to fence against them, and how to
prevent his being circumvented by them.</P>
<Q><P>2. Besides this Wariness, the Tradesman
ought to be a Man of universal Know∣ledge
in Dealing; he ought to under∣stand
something of all the general
Schemes of Commerce, especially of
his own Country; I say, <HI>his own Coun∣try
now,</HI> because I am confined in this
Discourse to the Inland Home-Trade
<PB N="72" REF="84"/>
of <HI>England,</HI> and am speaking of the
<HI>English</HI> Tradesman in particular; for
as to foreign Trade, it is not concern'd
in this Article at all.</P>
<P>As I am speaking thus of the Home∣Trade,
and the <HI>English</HI> Tradesman only:
It is not enough, that the Tradesman
should understand just what he more
immediately deals in; he meets with
frequent Offers and Occasions to Trade,
to Day in one Thing, to Morrow in an∣other;
to Day on his own Account, to
Morrow by Commission; to Day singly,
to Morrow in Partnership; and it is
requisite he should be a Man of Busi∣ness,
that, as is usually said, nothing may
come amiss to him, nothing may be so
out of his Way, as that he may not un∣derstand
it.</P></Q>
<P>IF he is not a Man of State and Poli∣ticks,
he should be a Man of full Employ;
a Tradesman is never idle: <HI>Business</HI> is in
its right Sense a comprehensive Word, and
requires a comprehensive Understanding
too in its kind; and though I have not
room fully to explain it, yet the Reader will
understand what I mean by what I have all
along insisted on in the Direction to Trades
men, namely, to apply themselves with all
their Might, and exert their utmost Dili∣gence
in the carrying on their Trade; to
<PB N="73" REF="85"/>
get Judgment in the Goods they deal in;
to gain a general Knowledge in all Business;
to be able to undertake any Trade, though
not bred to it; to understand how to corres∣pond;
to write a Trading Style; to keep
their Books well; and the like, in whatever
Business they undertake.</P>
<P>THESE Things help to constitute a Man
of Business; in a word, he that is thus
qualified is fit for any Thing, will get his
Bread in any Country, is agreeable to all
Society, and in all Places can turn his Hand
and his Head to any Trade, to any Employ∣ment,
as Occasion calls him out.</P>
<P>I need say no more then, to his Ca∣pacities:
You will easily grant, that
such a Man as this must not be a Fool,
not an empty shallow-headed, rattling,
nothing-doing Fellow; the Man of Bu∣siness
is a Man of Weight, a Man of
Value and of Worth, and cannot be an ig∣norant,
dull, unmeaning Head; it is evi∣dent
in Experience, we see it every where,
the Tradesman that is a thriving, managing,
diligent Man, is full of Vigour, full of Vi∣vacity,
always stirring and bustling, never
idle, never sottish; his Head and his Heart
are employ'd; he moves with a kind of
Velocity, unknown to other Men: The Plow∣man
goes on heavy, and with Labour, tho'
steadily and suitably to his Business too:
The Carrier <HI>wags on,</HI> according to the true
<PB N="74" REF="86"/>
Import of the Machine he drives, which
was therefore call'd a Waggon, from the
Slowness of its Motion; but the Tradesman,
all Life and Spirit, like a Planet, is conti∣nually
in a brisk Motion; and whether di∣rect
or retrogade, he always has his double
Revolution round his own Axis, and at the
same Time progressive too: He has his an∣nual
and his diurnal Motion; by the last
he influences his Shop, and immediate Cor∣respondence;
and by the first his Encrease
in Stock, and the general Gain of his Busi∣ness,
which he casts up annually for his
compleat Satisfaction.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Tradesman then must be
a Man of general Knowledge, as well as
of a particular Understanding; he must not
only understand his Shop, his Books, and
how to sell his Goods, but he must have a
general Knowledge of all Trade; he must
know the true Original of all the Goods he
deals in, the Growth and Fountain of every
Product, and the several Variations of Spe∣cies;
the Changes that every Manfacture suf∣fers
by Dying, Managing, and all the O∣perations
by which the Face of it is alter'd;
how it comes to be what it is; whence every
Thing comes, and whether it goes, and (as I
may call it) the Beginning and End of every
Article in Trade.</P>
<P>A Tradesman may be too learned, as I
have said, in other Things; but he can ne∣ver
<PB N="75" REF="87"/>
know too much in Trade; he may speak
too much <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> but can never
speak too much Trading <HI>English;</HI> he may
be too much a Man of Letters, but he can
never be too much a Man of Figures.</P>
<P>THE Compleat Tradesman is made com∣pleat
by this very Thing; 'tis by the gene∣ral
Knowledge of Business that he becomes
a Man of Business, that he is fitted for un∣dertaking
whatever offers to his Advantage,
and knows how to judge what is fit for him
to undertake.</P>
<P>AND this brings me to one of the main
Parts of a Tradesman's Wisdom, that Ex∣cellence
of Knowledge and Understanding
by which he knows not only what may be
for his Advantage, and what Undertaking to
venture upon, and how to enter upon it;
but by which he is qualified to give that
most useful Thing called a <HI>Negative</HI> in any
Proposal of Business that is before him.</P>
<P>IT is but too often that a Tradesman is
drawn in by the specious Pretences of Gain,
and of apparent Success, to embark in Busi∣ness
perhaps out of his Way, and remote
from his ordinary Employment; and some∣times
by the Nature of the Thing itself, or
by the meer Dint of his own Application
and exquisite Management, he may be said
even to force it to succeed.</P>
<P>BUT the nicest Part of his Skill is, to search
the Thing to the Bottom at first, and see all
<PB N="76" REF="88"/>
the Arcana, the Creeks and Corners of the
Affair beforehand, and judge whether it will
do, or no, before he engages; then accord∣ing
to that Judgment to refuse, as well as to
accept; and so, as above, to give a Nega∣tive,
if he sees it reasonable; not embark
first, and then find by the Loss that
the Thing would not do, and so be ob∣liged
at last to throw it up with burnt Fin∣gers.</P>
<P>THE
refusing specious Projects and fair∣looking
Proposals of Profit, calls for the ut∣most
Perfection of Judgment in a Trades∣man;
for the meer natural Propensity which
there is in a Tradesman, by the very Con∣sequence
of his Profession, to hearken to
every Thing that is probable to bring an
Advantage, has a violent Biass in his
Thoughts, in favour of a new Proposal; but
this Fire is often to his Loss, and he ought
to have a needful Degree of Phlegm to
balance it, to bring him to examine every
Side of the Proposal, see the good and the
bad together, setting the Probabilities on either
Side in a true Light, and judging with the
utmost Calmness and Indifferency between
the one and the other, so to bring himself to
a Power of saying No, which I must con∣fess
it is very difficult to a Tradesman to
do.</P>
<P>IN all Proposals, such as I am now speak∣ing
of, the Profits are generally placed in
<PB N="77" REF="89"/>
the Front of the Undertaking, and the
Tradesman is shewn the smooth Side of
Things first; the Difficulties, the Hazards,
the Possibilities, and Events, the Probabilities
of Disaster and Miscarriage ordinarily lie
hid, and out of Sight; and this is the Rea∣son
why so many Tradesmen are drawn into
Disaster and Misfortune before they are
aware, and dip into Business too deep be∣fore
they see their Way out, before they
find their Mistake, and why so many do not
see it till it is too late to retrieve it, and so
never get out at all.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman's Prudence, if he be a Man
of Judgment, is how to put every Thing to its
Tryal; HERE if at any Time Wit stands him
instead, when it furnishes him with a Penetra∣tion
sufficient to judge for himself, that he
may neither refuse an Advantage, which it
is against the Grain very much for a Trades∣man
to do, or fall into a Snare.</P>
<P>NOR is this meerly when an Offer is
made by Sharpers and Projectors, to cheat
and deceive him, and with a Design to tra∣pan
him; for there sometimes an ordinary
Judgment may find Things out, and a
Knave may be detected in the very first
Appearance; but it is most dangerous when
it is brought to him in the Hand of good∣meaning
honest Men, who may be mista∣ken
in their Judgment, or may be blinded
by the specious Probabilities, and the Out∣side
<PB N="78" REF="90"/>
of Things, and may offer and propose
without Design to delude or deceive the Per∣son
they make the Proposal to.</P>
<P>THESE are indeed of the two the most
dangerous; for in such a Case the Man
proposing is deceived himself, through his
Ignorance, and deceives or offers to deceive
the Tradesman innocently, and without any
Design of Evil; believing that the Propo∣sal
is really every Way as advantageous as
he (the Proposer) sets it out to be, of∣fering
to embark with him in an equal
Risque, and on an equal Foot with himself;
in which Case, if it fail, the Consequence
is, that they are both deceived together, and
perhaps both ruin'd together; and yet the
Man that drew him in may be no Deceiver
neither, as is often the Case.</P>
<P>Now here the Perfection of the Trades∣man's
Judgment shews itself; here is need
of his utmost Skill and Penetration, to see into
the deficient Parts of a fair and promising
Outside, to weigh with an unbiass'd and im∣partial
Judgment every Thing, not that
appears only, but all the Events, all the
Disappointments, and all the cross Incidents
that may happen to thwart the Expectations
of the Proposer, and render the Design
abortive, and, according to these Discoveries,
to close with, or to decline the Adventure.</P>
<P>BY this Prescience of his Understanding
and Judgment he concludes thus: It is pos∣sible,
<PB N="79" REF="91"/>
indeed, such an Undertaking may an∣swer,
nay, 'tis very probable too, and there
are such and such good Prospects in it, and
I believe the Man means no Fraud, but is
perfectly honest in the Design of it; but
I see there are Difficulties in it too, and here
it may fall short, there it may miscarry;
here I may be disappointed, and there I
may be disappointed; and upon the Whole,
I doubt it will do me no good, and there∣fore
I will not meddle with it, I wont ven∣ture;
I'll let it alone; better sit still, than
rise up and fall.</P>
<P>THIS Caution is the safe Side of a Trades∣man's
Management; and we seldom see such
a Man miscarry; 'tis the only Perfection of
his Judgment to be able to give a Nega∣tive,
and to give himself a Reason for it;
for the Difficulty of refusing, lies in the
Tradesman himself; the powerful Inclina∣tion
to get Money is in a Tradesman like the
Attraction in the Centre of the Solar System;
it draws all the Bodies within its Compass to,
or towards itself; it influences all their Mo∣tions,
and directs them to their proper End.</P>
<P>GAIN is the Tradesman's Life, 'tis the
Essence of his Being, as a qualified Trades∣man.
Convenience, and the Supply of ne∣cessary
Things for Life, were the first Causes
indeed of Trade; but the Reason and End
of the Tradesman is to get Money: 'Tis the
Pole-Star and Guide, the Aim and Design
<PB N="80" REF="92"/>
of all his Motions; 'tis the Center and
Point to which all his Actions tend; 'tis
the Soul of Business, the Spur of Industry,
the Wheel that turns within all the Wheels
of his whole Business, and gives Motion to
all the rest.</P>
<P>Now, 'tis hard to turn the Tradesman
from any Undertaking which has a probable
View of Gain in it: The Proposal comes
with great Advantage to him, when the very
Prospect shines in his Eyes with such a
Lustre, that 'tis a meer Prepossession in fa∣vour
of the Design itself, he is half
engaged before he looks into the Inside:
This makes him see every Thing afterward
with an already-biass'd Judgment, and the
Sight of his Understanding is dazzled, so
that he sees every Thing near hand double,
and Thing remote not at all.</P>
<P>BY this Delusion, the Man is too apt to be
drawn into the Snare, closes eagerly with a
new projected Scheme, jumps at the Bait,
and sees not the Hook; and many an inno∣cent
unthinking Tradesman is ruined by these
Precipitations. But the Man of Business takes
Things quite another Way; he weighs eve∣ry
Part with a calm Mind and a steady Judg∣ment;
he has, what the late King <HI>William</HI>
said of the Duke of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> a warm
Heart, and a cool Head; his Pulse beats high
for the Profit of a Business, as high as any
Man's, but his Hand will not go before his
<PB N="81" REF="93"/>
Head; his Act and Deed will not run be∣fore
his Judgment; he maturely considers
and weighs every Article, states the Ac∣count
of Profit and Loss, with an Equality
of Judgment, and wisely stands ready to
give the Negative, as easily as the Affirma∣tive,
if he sees an Occasion.</P>
<P>THE real Difficulty of this is a Testimo∣ny,
that a Compleat Tradesman must be no
Fool; there is much more of the wise Man
to be seen in the Negative, than in the Af∣firmative,
in almost all the Parts of Life.
'Tis one of the Characters of a Man of
Sense, that he knows how to say No. How
many well-natur'd, easy-temper'd, good-hu∣mour'd
Gentlemen are ruined in the World,
ruined in their Morals, in their Fortunes, in
their Prospects, meerly for Want of this hap∣py
Negative, for Want of the Power of
saying No.</P>
<P>SOCIETY tempts, a pleasant Companion in∣vites,
this Friend sends, and that Friend calls;
the easy, good-humoured, weak Creature,
goes immediately; he has no Power to resist;
he has no Negative, he cannot say No, and
away he goes, be it to the Tavern, or to a
worse House; nay, be it to the Gaming-Ta∣ble,
or still worse, the Highway.</P>
<P>BUT the rough positive Temper is the safe
Man; that can be surly, and if he dislikes
the Proposals, however his Inclination may
tempt him, yet turns upon his Heel, and
<PB N="82" REF="94"/>
says No; that's the Man that escapes the Dan∣ger.</P>
<P>IT is the same Thing in Trade: The safe
Man is he that can say No; who considering
all the Circumstances of a Proposal, and
weighing the bad against the good, the pro∣bable
Miscarriage against the probable Suc∣cess,
maturely says No; declines the Propo∣sal,
and avoids the Danger; is content to be
safe rather than rich, to be easy rather than
busy, that is, cautious of Hazard, as well as
forward for Profit.</P>
<P>THIS, therefore, is the Wisdom of a Trades∣man,
and it requires a great Share of Un∣derstanding,
as well as of Prudence, to guide
the Man of Business in this Part; for it is
a difficult Thing, and the wifest Man may
be mistaken; he may refuse an Advantage
as well on one Hand, and (as they call it in
the Language of Trade) stand in his own
Light, as well as avoid a Loss on t'other;
all that can be said is, he must judge for him∣self:
And that brings me back to the Propo∣sitions
advanc'd above, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Trades∣man
must be no Fool.</P>
<P>THERE are, indeed, a Set of Men in the
World, and in our particular <HI>British</HI> World
of Trade too, for that is what I mean by our
World, who have but a very mean Share of
Understanding, and yet carry on great Trades,
go through a great deal of Business, and
with Success too; nay, some are of Opi∣nion,
<PB N="83" REF="95"/>
that these downright empty-headed
Tradesmen are the sasest, and best, and the
most likely to thrive; and we often find it
so.</P>
<P>BUT then I must add, these are generally
Men, who either have a certain natural Cau∣tion
in their Tempers, which guides them to
say No, as above, though they do it without
any Act of their Judgment, because they have
little or no Judgment to act with; Or that
have a kind of a Sagacity, as the Birds espe∣cially,
and also other Brutes have, to be
afraid of every Body, and so they trust no
Body; they are shy of every Thing that
stirs, and every Body that offers; believe
every Body will bite them, and cheat them,
and by this they are secured; nothing can
hurt them, for they meddle with nothing;
no Body can cheat them, because they trust
no Body; no Body deceives them, because
they believe no Body.</P>
<P>BUT this kind of general Jealousy of
Mankind, is not the Act or Effect of the
Tradesman's Judgment; it is not his Wis∣dom,
as I was just now speaking, and the
Perfection of his Trading Prudence; but 'tis
a meer brutal Part, gross and rough, sordid∣ly
ignorant, and neither guided by Reason,
or by the Nature of the Thing; 'tis neither
an Act of Prudence or of Foresight, but a
meer Part of surly Ignorance, and Humour:
Such Men as these, as they are safe from
<PB N="84" REF="96"/>
the Accident of their Temper, so they are
rich, if it so happens to them, meerly from
the Consequence of being <HI>So and So</HI> stated in
a Round of Business, by the Accident of
their Situation; having perhaps jump'd into
a Shop, or into a Trade, by Succession to
Parents or Masters, who left it to them; and so
Coing right forward, like the Carrier's Horse
in the Road, where they were always used
to travel; as they would be lost if they were
but just turn'd out into a strange Track,
where they had never gone before, so they
are obstinate against all Proposals, that may
turn them out of the old Path.</P>
<P>THEIR Success, I say, is the meer Effect
of their Situation in Trade; and if they are
put out of the Road of Business, they are
lost; they neither know to go on, or how to
find their Way into the Road again from
whence they come.</P>
<P>THESE are a sort of Passive People, who
stand as an Exception against a general Rule;
who thrive in their Ignorance, and grow rich,
not by their Wisdom, but meerly by being
Fools; meerly because they were in the Road,
and had neither Courage or Understanding
to go out of it.</P>
<P>BUT if a Fool in Trade happens to thrive,
and perhaps thrives because he is a Fool, yet
it does not at all argue agaist my Proposi∣tion,
that a Tradesman should be a Man of
Sense. If the honst Tradesmen were all
<PB N="85" REF="97"/>
Fools, the t'other Half, I mean the K—s
Tradesmen, would be all Aldermen, that is
to say, all rich; for they would soon make
their Market of their Neighbours; for all
the Foods would not be wary and cautious,
like him hinted at above, and the rest would
be undone; in a word, a Fool may be a
Tradesman, but the Compleat Tradesman I
speak of must not be a Fool.</P>
<P>NOR could such wife Fools as that I have
describ'd, carry on the vast Inland Commerce
of this Nation: Here and there a weak Man
acting within his own narrow Circle, and
having the Pattern of wiser Heads round
him, to be as it were, his Pole-Star to steer
by, may go plodding on, as I have said,
and may do well enough, may act with a
little, and keep himself up tolerably well:
But when we come to describe a Man of Cor∣respondence
and of general Trade, a Man
carrying on a Head of Business, and, as we
say, driving the World before him; the poor
empty-headed Man I speak of, must not be
the Man; his Capacity is not equal to it;
as his Understanding is confin'd, so must his
Correspondence; a large Business would be
too much for his Head, if it was not too
much for his Hands; as his Brains are limit∣ed,
so would his Circle of Business be re∣strained;
and it would appear, he could ne∣ver
be a Compleat Tradesman, because he
was a Fool.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the honest Tradesman, when by Time
and long Success in Trade, he is growen
well to pass, how he ought to govern him∣self,
and how to guard against Disasters
which naturally attend a prosperous
Circumstance in Trade.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are now to suppose a Tradesman,
having been twenty Years, or per∣haps
more, in his Business, and
having pursued it with an honest
Diligence, and been blest, that is, with tole∣rable
Success is grown warm in his Nest, is
beforehand in the World, and begins to be
called a rich Man.</P>
<P>I'LL take it for granted too, that having
prospered thus long, he has gain'd some
Reputation and Character in the World:
And there are three Characters; one of which
a Tradesman of such standing generally
comes under the Name of, whether with
good or bad Fame.</P>
<Q><P>1. THAT he has been a <HI>Hard-Head,</HI> a
Devourer, a <HI>Jew;</HI> for these and more
<PB N="87" REF="99"/>
such are the general Titles by which such
Tradesmen are usually distinguish'd and
known; that he will let no Body live
by him, that he will skin a Flint, that
he will buy cheaper than any Man
can sell, and sell dearer than any Man
can buy; that he cares not who sinks
if he can but swim; that he grinds the
Faces of his Workmen, and will hard∣ly
let a poor Man live by his Labour:
Thus he has got what he has by gri∣ping
and squeezing of labouring Men;
and that it will never thrive with him,
<HI>and the like.</HI></P>
<P>2. OR they tell you he has got it by
<HI>Sharping</HI> and <HI>Trickin,</HI> undermining
of his Neighbours, worming People
out of their Interest in Things, and
setting up Bubbles and Bites to cheat
the World with; that he is a Man of
no <HI>Conscience,</HI> that cares not who loses
so he can but gain; that he (in a word)
cheats every Body if he can, but takes
care no Body shall cheat him; that he
has been a Knave in his Dealing, over∣reaching
and defrauding wherever he
could; that so he did but get Money,
he car'd not how he got it, nor of
whom; that he neither valued the
Blessing of the Rich, or the Curses of
the Poor, so he could but get Money by
them. This is a dreadful Character,
<PB N="88" REF="100"/>
it must be cofesss'd; and that there
are some Tradesmen that deserve it,
must also be granted: But the next is
a brighter Side by a great deal, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>3. THAT he is an honest, open-hearted,
generous, fair-dealing Tradesman; that
every Body speaks well of him, loves
to deal with him; and whether they
get or lose by him, they are always
pleased; that he treats the Rich with
good Manners, and the Poor with good
Language, is courteous and kind to
all People, and that in particular he is a
punctual Pay-Master; that when he has
made a Bargain, whether he gets or
loses by it, he always performs it, and
without Murmuring or Cavilling; that
he takes no unjust Advantage, does not
lie upon the Catch to supplant any
Body, and scorns, in short, to do an
ill Thing, though he might gain by
it; that his Word is as sacred as his
Bond; that he never grinds the Face of
the Poor, but pays for his Work chear∣fully
and readily, and is content to let
poor Men live by him; that he scorns
to make Mistake pass for Payment, or
to lie upon the Catch to trapan his
Neighbour; in a word, that he is a
fair, downright, honest Man, God has
blest him, and every Body gives him a
good Word.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="89" REF="101"/>
I believe I may venture to say, that one
of these three Characters takes in almost all
the thriving Part of our Tradesmen, let
them be of what Trade, or of what kind
of Business they will: It is true, there are
some who come under a middling kind of
Half-in-Half Character, and are neither well
spoken of, or ill spoken of; neither well
thought of, or ill thought of; no People
hardly know what to make of them, or
what to say to them; they are close and
concealed, honest in Shew, and never bite
and devour, but when no Body sees them,
and when they can do it securely; that
are fond of being called honest Men, and
make as if they would deserve it; but cut
sharp, go close to the Brink of Knavery, tho'
they would not be thought to step out be∣yond
their Bounds; that keep themselves to
themselves; and, in a word, no Body knows
where to have them.</P>
<P>THESE must be what they are; as no Bo∣dy
speaks much ill of them, so I shall say
little well of them, only this, that they are
none of the People that will raise the Credit
of the Tradesmen in general to any great
Height; and when a Slanderer tells us that
all Tradesmen must be K—, we cannot
bring this Tradesman out for a Voucher in
their Behalf.</P>
<P>BUT now, to speak of the Tradesman as
such, let his just Character be as it will, what is
<PB N="90" REF="102"/>
his Business now he is, as we say, thriven,
and grown rich; he understood his Business,
or else he would not have gone on so well;
but let me tell him, he is not past the Dan∣ger
yet; Men of the best Figures in Trade
have met with a Fall, and have made a Slip
at last, which at one Blow have ruin'd all
their Prospects, blasted them at once, and
overthrown at one Blow all their twenty
Years Labour: Witness the late Directors
of the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Company; and let their
Fall be just or unjust, that is not my Busi∣ness;
perhaps I am not of the same Opi∣nion
with the general Clamour under which
they fell; but this Part is exactly to my
presently Purpose.</P>
<P>MANY of those Gentlemen were Trades∣men
of long standing; they had behav'd so
as to have obtain'd, and as I have heard,
to deserve an unspotted Reputation in Trade:
If they were not honest Men, there were
indeed no honest Men in Trade in the World,
nay, some received that Testimony even in
the very Article of their Misfortune, and
may besaid to fall, only in consequence of
the Title they bore, and the Office they
were embarked in, tho' it appeared they had
not acted one way or other; but if I may
use the Words of an infinitely superior Case,
they were number'd with Transgressors.</P>
<P>YET these Men fell into Ruin; as Down
a Precipice, ingulph'd at once in the common
<PB N="91" REF="103"/>
Calamity; as Directors without directing; as
guilty, tho' innocent; as blackened with the
general Calumny, tho' not particularly ca∣lumniated.</P>
<P>EVEN the worst of those unhappy Gen∣tlemen,
how were they sent into the Wil∣derness
like the 'Scape Goat, with the Sins
of their Superiors upon their Heads, bearing
the Burden for other People's Crimes, and
linking, as it were, on purpose, to let others
swim.</P>
<P>BUT not to enter into particular Cases any
farther than to make them Examples for the
Caution of others, and to intimate to the
World, how they ought to act in the Conduct
of Trading Life, which is the most intricate
of all human Measures; let the People I
am writing to take the Hint, and than leave
the Persons to their own Oppressions, which
are heavy enough: The Use of it to us in
the Case before me is this.</P>
<P>A Tradesman is never safe; his Condition
is subjected to innumerable Casualties, and
to unavoidable Disasters: No Estate is so big
as not to be in Hazard, no Posture of his
Affairs out of the Reach of Accidents; while
he continues in Trade, like a Seaman, tho'
he is at the Mouth of the Harbour, nay,
tho' safe in the Port, and come to an An∣chor,
he can never say he is entirely out
of Danger, and perfectly safe, till he has set
both Feet safe on Shore; in the Mer∣chandize
<PB N="92" REF="104"/>
on board 'tis the same, the Voyage
is not ended till the Goods are landed, and
in the Merchant's Warehouse.</P>
<P>IN like manner, the Tradesman is not past
the Danger till his Bottom is wound up;
and if he continues in Trade, we may say
of him, he is never perfectly safe till he is
nail'd up between two Elm Boards; never
out of Danger till he is in his Grave; no
State of Prosperity so high, or so great, but
some have fallen from as high a Condition.</P>
<P>I once saw a Spectacle, which, tho' I was
entirely unconcern'd, mov'd me so much,
that it brought Tears into my Eyes in spite
of all my Resolution, and, I am perswaded,
must a little affect the most sensible Reader.
It was a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> a Tradesman;
he did not live far from the <HI>Monument,</HI> and
his Name was—: I conceal it in com∣passion
to his Memory: He was not only
believed, but it was afterwards proved that
he was a clear Man, all his Debts paid,
with upwards of 200000 <HI>l.</HI> in his Pocket.</P>
<P>IN the Height of his Prosperity I have
seen him cloathed in Embroideries, and
Cloath of Gold Wastcoats, his Coach and
six Horses, and three or four Footmen waiting
for him at the <HI>Exchange-Gate:</HI> His Lady
in her guilt Chariot, which cost 400 <HI>l.</HI> her
Habit the richest imaginable, <HI>tout Brilliant,</HI>
as the <HI>French</HI> call it, covered with Diamonds
and Jewels, without Price.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="105"/>
WITHIN less than twenty Years I saw
this Man led into Mr. Baron <HI>Hatsell</HI>'s Cham∣ber
in the <HI>Temple,</HI> between two of his Cre∣ditors,
crying like a Child, and hardly able
to support the Weight of his Grief. The
Creditors came with him, to testify how his
Calamity had master'd all their Resentment;
and one of his Creditors was so mov'd, that
he wept at the very Spectacle. In a word,
he came to be discharg'd by the Act of Par∣liament
called, the <HI>Act for discharging Deb∣tors,</HI>
where two Thirds in Number, and
Value of their Creditors, complied; and
this poor Man came to claim the Benefit of
it, bringing in his Hand his Instrument of
Composition for one Penny in the Pound;
I say one Penny for every twenty Shillings,
for ninety thousand Pound Debts; and, as
one of the Creditors told me, they were to
take his Bond for that Penny.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the Vicissitudes of a Tradesman's
Life; if a Man riding in his Coach and Six,
with 200000 <HI>l.</HI> in his Pocket, may sink un∣der
the Disasters of Trade, who then can
say he is safe, and out of Danger: How of∣ten
have I heard a Tradesman say, <HI>I lost</HI>
30000 <HI>l. by such a Project: I lost 20000 l.
by such a Company:</HI> How must it be with
many a Man, when within the Space of
two or three Years the <HI>East-India</HI> Com∣pany
Stock would be worth 350 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI>
and down beneath 70 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> The
<PB N="94" REF="106"/>
<HI>African</HI> Stock at 400 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and sink
down under 40 <HI>l.</HI> and this thirty Years and
more before the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Distractions pos∣sess'd
the Nation.</P>
<P>THE Linnen Manufacture was at 400 <HI>l.
per Cent.</HI> and not worth ten Pounds within
the Compass of less than five Years.</P>
<P>THE Paper Company was at the like
Rate of 400 <HI>l. per Cent.</HI> and at length came
down to no Buyers, and consequently no
Price.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Hudson</HI> Bay Company the like, and
their Colony and Plantation gone, taken by
the <HI>French,</HI> and the Stock sunk to nothing.</P>
<P>THE like was to be said of several other
Projects and Undertakings at that Time;
and how many flourishing Tradesmen sunk
under it? nay, some that did not fall by
Stock-jobbing and Bubbling; for these
Things were young in the World, and
scarce heard of in these Days.</P>
<P>I might go back beyond these, to the Times
of King <HI>Charles</HI> II. and the shutting up
the <HI>Exchequer:</HI> How many flourishing
Tradesmen sunk in those Times, who
thought themselves above the Reach of
Trading Disasters? <HI>The Forths,</HI> who were
once Men of such Funds and Figure, that
one of them undertook to farm the Reve∣nue
of <HI>Ireland;</HI> of whom, when they fail∣ed,
King <HI>Charles</HI> II. said merrily, that
three Fourths of the City were broke: It
<PB N="95" REF="107"/>
seems there were three Brothers of them; and
at last they all came to be so low, that they
were maintain'd by mere Charity.</P>
<P>HOW many City Knights, Aldermen, and
some of them Lord Mayors, can I reckon
up from Sir <HI>Robert Vyner</HI> to Sir <HI>Justus
Beck,</HI> who have sunk from a Knighthood,
and immense Wealth to the lowest Misery
and Poverty: I think I can reckon fourteen
within the Compass of my own Remem∣brance,
besides some Hundreds equal to them
in Wealth, tho' not honour'd with the
Sir and the Gold Chain. Some of these were,
<LIST>
<ITEM>Sir <HI>Robert Vyner,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Ald. <HI>Backwell,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Ald. <HI>Forth,</HI> and his
Two Brothers,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir <HI>Thomas Vyner,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Sir</HI> John Sweetapple,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir <HI>Matthew Kirwood,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir <HI>Thomas Cook,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Sir <HI>Basil Firebrass,
cum aliis.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THESE are recent Testimonies that no Pros∣perity
in Trade is out of the Reach of Di∣saster;
so that the Tradesman can never call
himself a safe Man, till he is entirely drawn
out of Trade, and, as I said before, landed
in the Grave, or in his Country Retreat,
and can say, he has no more to do with Bu∣siness.</P>
<P>HENCE then, the Tradesman is not above
Caution, let his Condition be what it will:
My Caution is this, never to run out of his
Business into Hazards, great Undertakings,
<PB N="96" REF="108"/>
capital Adventures, wild Experiments upon
Presumption of Success, and upon Prospect
of new Advantage and farther Gain: Me∣thinks
a Man that has once 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket, should not want to be advised to be
satisfied with the Road of Business, which
has rais'd him to that Height, and not to
hazard a Fall, in order to rise higher.</P>
<P>HE that is not satisfied, and does not think
himself rich enough with 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket, neither would he be satisfied one Jot
the more, if he had five Times that Sum.
Where was the Man in the late distracted
Times, who thought himself well, and sat
still content with the most immense Sum?
had it been possible, we had not had so many
ruined Families now among us, cursing their
own Avarice, and lamenting their Folly; I
was worth so much and so much; some
50000 <HI>l.</HI> some twice as much, but could not
be content, and so fool'd it away all.</P>
<P>LET the wise and wary Tradesman take
the Hint, keep within the Bounds where
Providence has placed him, be content to rise
gradually and gently, as he has done; and
as he is sufficiently rich, if he will make
it more, let it be in the old Road; go softly
on, least he comes not softly down.</P>
<P>PRECIPITATIONS of all Kinds are dangerous;
a Tradesman rises gently, but he falls hasti∣ly;
nay, which is worse than all the rest,
and is particular to the Disasters of Trade, a
<PB N="97" REF="109"/>
Tradesman seldom stumbles, but he falls;
the Reason lies here, the least Slip of a
Tradesman touches his Credit, and if his Cre∣dit
is touch'd, the Tradesman is gone: He
may struggle for some Time, and if his Bot∣tom
is very good, he may perhaps keep him∣self
from a mortal Wound; but let his Bot∣tom
be what it will, he rarely recovers it in
Trade, never goes on chearfully and tho∣roughly
if his Credit is hurt by the Blow:
'Tis like some Diseases, which, tho' they may
be cur'd as the Physicians call a Cure, yet
they leave a Taint in the Blood, which is ne∣ver
thoroughly carried off, but breaks out
again upon all Occasions of other Illness,
and the Man is never perfectly sound while
he lives.</P>
<P>I know 'tis objected, that when a Man is
once grown rich, his Dependance upon Cre∣dit
is at an End; what cares he? or rather,
what need he care for Credit, that has twen∣ty
thousand Pounds in his Pocket?</P>
<P>I would rather say, what need he care for
Trade, that has twenty thousand Pound in
his Pocket? why should he trade any farther?
and what need he desire any more, that has
such a Bank? 'Tis Time to leave off and
have done; 'tis Time to leave labouring for
the World, when he has the World, as they
call it, in a String.</P>
<P>I must confess, I am of Opinion, it would be
much better for the publick Interest of Trade,
<PB N="98" REF="110"/>
and for the Tradesmen too, if every Man that
is advan<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d in Business, so as to be worth
twenty thousand Pounds, should leave off;
as I have said above, that it would be
much better for Trade, and for the publick
State of Business; so I add now, 'twould be
much better for the Nation in general, that
twenty Tradesmen, with each a thousand
Pound in his Pocket, were employ'd in
Trade, than one Tradesman with twenty
thousand Pounds. For first, the same Trade
would then maintain twenty Families, which
now supports but one. 2. Those twenty Fa∣milies,
would in consequence, have abun∣dance
of Dependencies more upon them,
than one single Family, let that one Family
make as good a Figure in Trade as they will.
3. The twenty Families would act, with less
Danger to one another, and to Trade in
general, than one over-rich Tradesman
does, or can do.</P>
<P>I explain my self thus:
<Q>1. The Number of Families maintain'd
by Trade, while the Commerce it self
is under no Oppression by them, is a
visible Benefit, nay, even a Blessing to
the Nation, where the Trade is carried
currently on, as that Increase of People,
is a Blessing in it self; but 'tis a far∣ther
Benefit too, as it is an Increase of
the diligent Part of the People, an In∣crease
<PB N="99" REF="111"/>
not of Vagrants and indigent Peo∣ple;
Mouths that are unprofitable and
that live upon the Labour of other Peo∣ple,
more capable or more industrious
than themselves; but as it is an Increase
of Business, and of People to do it: An
Increase of Labour always brings Hands
together to perform it, and the multiply∣ing
of diligent labouring People, where
Work is found to employ them, is cer∣tainly
a publick Benefit to the Nation.</Q></P>
<P>I cannot think I should be ask'd so weak a
Question, whether a Trade carried on by
twenty Master-Tradesman, with each Man a
thousand Pound in Stock, shall not necessari∣ly
employ more People than that same Trade,
carried on by one Master-Tradesman, with
the same Stock united in one Hand; the Fact is
so easily to be demonstrated, that it will hardly
bear the Name of a Question. Suppose it was
only that they keep every one an Apprentice,
and one other Servant, it cannot be suggested,
that the other Tradesman, tho' with twenty
thousand Pounds in his Pocket, would keep
twenty Apprentices and twenty Servants, be
it almost of any Trade whatever; and if it
was not a Shop-Keeping Trade, but an Em∣ployment
that required some Hands, yet the
rich Master-Tradesman could not employ
twenty Times the Number of Men, as the
single thousand Pound Man would do; so
<PB N="100" REF="112"/>
that even that Way the common Interest
lies best in the twenty Hands than in one.</P>
<P>ADD to this what relates to the second
Consideration above, <HI>viz.</HI> that the twenty
Tradesmen must inhabit twenty Houses, pay
abundantly a greater Proportion to all Man∣ner
of Taxes, be rated perhaps twenty Times
as much to the Poor, to Parish Taxes, to
the Church, to the Highways, and to every
personal Rate; for sometimes the Tradesman,
with his twenty thousand Pounds Stock, may
live in no better a House than the Tradesman
with a thousand Pounds Stock; so that in
all these Cases the dividing Trade into many
Hands, is a much greater Advantage to the
Publick, than to have it continued in one
Hand only.</P>
<P>AS to the last Head, <HI>viz.</HI> that it would be
better for Trade itself, 'tis an Article of par∣ticular
Moment in the Subject I am upon, and
brings me forward to the immediate Subject of
the next Chapter, relating to Mischiefs or∣dinarily
attending Trade, from the Encroach∣ings,
Engrossings, and other avaricious Mea∣sures
which are often the Consequences of an
over-grown Tradesman's pushing still on
when he is too great and too powerful for
his Neighbours.</P>
<P>THOSE Tradesmen, who, tho' increas'd
in their Trade, can set no Bounds to their De∣sires;
who neither know when they have
enough, or when they have too much, are
<PB N="101" REF="113"/>
oftentimes fatal in their Measures, not only
to their Neighbours in Trade, but even to
Trade itself; and therefore the Publick is
sometimes oblig'd to make Laws against them
to restrain their Exorbitancies and Excesses,
and to prevent their eating up the little
Tradesmen about them.</P>
<P>THESE are the Laws against Extortion,
taking large Interest for Money, engrossing
particular Commodities, forestalling Mar∣kets,
Combinations in Trade, and the like;
all which are the Effects of large over∣match'd
Stocks, and the Capital Projects of
money'd Men in Trade; and if it were not for
such Laws, sometimes the smaller Trades∣men
would be over-run, be foreclos'd in
Trade, and be left to stand at their Shops
or Shop-Doors unemploy'd, and without
Business.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, 'tis evident, that an
over-grown or over-rich Tradesman, pushing
still on in Trade, is really far from being a
publick Benefit to Trade itself in the gene∣ral,
or to the Country where he lives; or it
is far from a Benefit to Trade to have it con∣tracted
in a few Hands, to have it circulate
in Gross, and be manag'd by a few Masters.</P>
<P>I might run it out, for farther Explana∣tion,
into the particular manufacturing
Tradesmen, where it is much more to be seen
than in the Shop-Keeping Part; but I shall
speak of it again at large in its Place.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="114"/>
I return therefore to the rich Tradesman,
whose Case was the principal Subject of this
Chapter: Two Things are absolutely neces∣sary
to him to take into his Concern, and
are never below him, so long as Trade itself
is not below him.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> HE is to be cautious still of not launch∣ing
out beyond himself: Nothing of its kind
is more common than for the Tradesman,
when he once finds himself grown rich, to
have his Head full of great Designs and
new Undertakings. He finds his Cash flow
in upon him, and perhaps he is fuller of
Money than his Trade calls for; and as he
scarce knows how to employ more Stock in
it than he does, his Ears are the sooner
open to any Project or Proposal that offers
itself; and I must add, that this is the most
critical Time with him in all his Life; if
ever he is danger of Ruin, 'tis just then.</P>
<Q><P>1. HE is first of the Opinion, that as he has
an over-grown Stock, he ought to em∣ploy
it, and that no Money ought to
lie idle; what though it is an Adven∣ture
a little out of his Way, he only
employs some loose Corns in it, some
small Sums that he can spare, and which
he does not value; if he loses them it
won't hurt him, and the like.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="115"/>
2. THAT 'tis a probable Undertaking; that
it may hit, and then he shall do his Bu∣siness
at once; and then comes all the
great Things into his Head that am∣bitious
Men fire their Thoughts with,
which turn the Windmill of his Brain
so fast, that they make him delirious in
Trade, and he is a meer Trade Luna∣tick
ever after.</P></Q>
<P>THIS therefore, I say, is the most critical
Time of a Tradesman's Life; at this Moment
he is more in Danger of being undone than
ever he was when he had not 500<HI>l.</HI> in his
Pocket. For,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> HE ought to be told, that no
Tradesman is out of Danger of being un∣done
while he continues in Trade, that no
Estate, no over-grown Circumstance is too
great to be ruin'd by a Project; nay, the
greater and stronger his Stock, and the vainer
he is of it, the more Danger he is in of run∣ning
some bold Adventure, which may at
last give him a mortal Wound, and hazard
the Overthrow of all his Fortunes at once.
I could name such Examples of this, that
has happened within our own Knowledge and
Memory, that would put it out of all Ques∣tion;
and I forbear meerly because I would
not open the Wounds of the unhappy Suf∣ferers,
<PB N="104" REF="116"/>
and bring the Miserable upon the
Stage again, to renew their Sorrows.</P>
<P>HE that in this World thinks himself se∣cure
against the Shocks of Fortune, as we
may well call them, seems either to know
very little of the World, or to think but lit∣tle
of what he does know: No Station is
above Disaster; and no Man is so subject to
them, as he that having a strong Fund, is yet
for pushing at more, not knowing when he
has enough, or not satisfied with enough.
As Ambition is the Ruin of the greatest Mo∣narch
when he grasps at, and would devour
his innocent neighbouring Princes and States,
so <HI>Avarice</HI> is often the Ruin of the greatest
Tradesmen, when not satisfied with having
gain'd a plentiful Fortune by their Diligence
and Application, they are resolv'd to push at
greater Things than they can grasp, launch
out of their Depth in Trade, and blinded with
the Vanity of their projected Hopes, do not
see their Danger.</P>
<P>AN ill Pilot as soon loses a great Ship as
a small, and a rich Cargo is as easily ship∣wreck'd
as a poor: The Rocks and Sands which
lie under Water hid and conceal'd, are as
dangerous to a Man of War as to a Merchant
Ship; and the Number of its Guns, which
makes it terrible to other Enemies, are ra∣ther
Instruments to forward its Ruin, in case
of Tempests and Storms, than Helps to deli∣ver
it.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="117"/>
THE richer the Tradesman is, the bolder
he is apt to be in his Adventures, not being to
be so easily wounded by a Loss; but as the
Gamester is tempted to throw again, to re∣trieve
the past Loss, so one Adventure in
Trade draws in another, till at last comes a
capital Loss, which weakens the Stock, and
which wounds the Reputation; and thus, by
one Loss coming in the Neck of another,
the Tradesman is first made desperate, in his
Desperation ventures at all, and so is at once
undone.</P>
<P>IF any Man should be so ill-natur'd as to
tell me I speak too feelingly upon this Part
of the Subject, though it may not be the
kindest Thing he could have said to a poor
Author, yet it may not be the worse for
the Argument: An old Sailor, that has split
upon a sunk Rock, and has lost his Ship, is
not the worst Man to make a Pilot of for
that Coast; on the contrary, he is in par∣ticular
able to guide those that come after
him to shun the Dangers of that unhappy
Place.</P>
<P>TRADE is a safe Channel to those that
keep in the <HI>fair Way,</HI> (so the Sailors call the
ordinary Entrance into an Harbour;) but
if in Contempt of Dangers, and of fair
Warnings, any Man will run out of the
Course, neglect the Buoys and Marks which
are set up by the Publick for the Direction
of Sailors, and, at all Hazards, venture
<PB N="106" REF="118"/>
among the Rocks, he is to blame no body
but himself if he loses his Ship.</P>
<P>THE Sum of the Matter is this; That no
Tradesman, however rich and prosperous,
should think himself out of the Reach of
Misfortunes in Business, and therefore none
should run upon needless Hazards and Diffi∣culties,
in confidence of their own good Suc∣cess
in Things past, and upon the Assurance
of their Strength of Stock, no Condition
being beyond the Reach of Disaster.</P>
<P>HOW unpitied do such Men fall? how
does the World reproach them with Stupidi∣ty
and Folly, when they who had no need
to hazard themselves, run into unlikely Ad∣venturings,
and ruin themselves without
Cause; who thinking themselves safe, fall
when no body throws them down, and sur∣prize
the World with their Disasters, when
every one thought them secure from all Di∣faster?</P>
<P>I
know no State of Life, I mean in that
we call the Middle Station of it, and among
the senisible Part of Mankind, which is more
suited to make Men perfectly easy, and com∣fortable
to themselves, than that of a thriving
Tradesman: He seems not only thoroughly
settled with Respect to his Circumstances,
but that Settlement seems the best secur'd and
establish'd; and tho' he is not uncapable of a
Disaster, yet is in the best Manner fenc'd
against it of any Man whatever.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="119"/>
HIS Life is perfectly easy, surrounded
with Delights; every Way his Prospect is
good; if he is a Man of Sense, he has the
best Phylosophick Retreats that any Station
of Life offers him: He is able to retire from
Hurry, to contemplate his own Felicity, and
to see it the least encumber'd of any State
of the middle Part of Life: And as the low
State of Life is in itself the best qualified to
make a Man really happy, so he has the
best Station in that low State.</P>
<P>HE is below the Snares of the Great, and
above the Contempt of those that are call'd
Low: His Business is a Road of Life, with
few or no uneven Places in it; no chequer'd
Work, no Hills and Dales in it, no Woods
and Wildernesses to lose his Way, and wan∣der
in: Plenty surrounds him, and the In∣crease
flows in daily: Like a swelling Tide,
he has a Flood without an Overwhelming;
Deeps without Drowning, Heights without
falling: He is a safe Man, nothing can hurt
him but himself: If he comes into any Mis∣chiefs,
they are of his own chusing; if he falls,
'tis his own doing, and he has no body to
blame but himself.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman, when he has thriven and
grown rich by his Trade; how he ought to
act with regard to the Publick Interest
of Trade, as it respects the Country he
lives in; and of its being necessary that
Trade should run through as many Hands
as it can.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T does not follow, that because a
Tradesman is grown rich by Trade,
that therefore he must turn a general
Devourer and Destroyer of the Trade
itself, as well as of his Neighbour Trades∣man;
that he must, or may make Ravages
and Depredations by the Greatness of his
Stock, and run down, and ruin, not only the
Tradesmen about him, but the Trade it self.</P>
<P>THERE is a due Regard, which Justice
claims from him, even after his own Business
is done, to preserve as far as may be fairly
and honestly to himself, the Interest of the
Trade in general, as well as his own Inte∣rest
in particular; and thus in all his Me∣thods
of carrying on his Trade. An honest
Sailor, when by the Assistance of his Expe∣rience
<PB N="109" REF="121"/>
he knows the Entrance, and how to car∣ry
his Ship safe into Harbour, will do nothing
to bar or block up the Passage against those
that come after him: On the contrary, he
leaves all the Marks and Buoys which have
been a Guide to him, exactly in their first Po∣sition,
that others may steer with Safety the
same Way after him.</P>
<P>IT seems not unjust only, but a little mali∣cious,
that when a Tradesman is got into a
Channel of Trade, by his Success in which he
has gain'd an Estate, he should purposely ren∣der
that Channel impracticable to others. For
Example:</P>
<P>THERE is a Maxim in Trade, <HI>as I have said,</HI>
especially in the Home Trade, which will ever
remain true as long as Trade bears its Name in
the World, <HI>viz.</HI> That the more Hands it
goes through, the greater publick Advantage
it is to the Country it is carried on or mana∣ged
in; and therefore, it is not always the
true Interest of a Manufacturer in this or that
particular Place, to shorten or lessen the need∣ful
Expence of Trade, tho' it should render
the Goods something the cheaper at Market.</P>
<Q>N. B. I am not speaking now of Foreign,
but of Home Trade, and Goods for a
Home Consumption; it must be always
true, that it is our Interest to send our
Manufacture as cheap to a foreign Mar∣ket
as we can, especially where they
<PB N="110" REF="122"/>
are rivalled by other Manufactures of
the same or a like kind. But even in
that Case, it were better that Encourage∣ment
were given to the Exportation, by
taking off Imposts or Duties payable
on the said Exportation, and even by
Bounties given by the Publick to en∣courage
the Merchant, than by Depre∣dations
upon the Trade it self.</Q>
<P>EVERY Manufacture has its proper Chan∣nel
of Trade, after it is finished as a Manu∣facture;
as it is made in this or that particu∣lar
Country remote from <HI>London,</HI> it is, gene∣rally
speaking, sent up to <HI>London</HI> for Sale:
There it is sold by a Factor or Warehouse∣Keeper
to the Merchant for Exportation, or
to the Shop-Keeper for retailing, or to the
Wholesale-Man, for sending again into other
Countries proper for its Sale, and to the
Shop-Keepers there for Retail, and so on.</P>
<P>THE growing of the Wool, and the wearing
of the Cloths, are the two Extremes of Trade;
the Beginning and End of all Manufacturing
and Management about it. The Sheep-Mas∣ter,
who sheers and sells the Fleece,
and the Shop-Keeper, who sells the Cloth
or Cloths ready made by Retail, are the
first and the last Tradesmen concerned in the
whole Trade: Now to bring it directly to
the Point, and that the meanest Capacity may
understand me, I observe here, that the more
<PB N="111" REF="123"/>
Hands this Manufacture, suppose of Cloths
or Stuff, passes through, either in the Work∣manship,
or Carriage, or Sale of the Goods;
and which the Goods themselves are able to
spport, so much the greater Benefit is that
Manufacture to the publick Stock of the Na∣tion,
because the Employment of the People is
the great and main Benefit of Trade.</P>
<P>IT is not an Equivalent to say, that the
Wearer or Consumer shall buy the Cloth or
Stuff Six Pence or a Shilling a Yard, or a
Suit of Cloaths Two or Three Shillings the
cheaper; for though that would be some Be∣nefit
to him in private, yet it is not, I say, an
Equivalent to the finding Bread and Subsis∣tance,
as it passes, for six or seven Families,
who might otherwise gain their Living by
that Manufacture, if it went in the ordinary
Channel. For Example;</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the Manufacture be a Piece of
Broad Cloth, and it is made in <HI>Wiltshire,</HI> at
<HI>Warminster,</HI> or thereabouts. The Clothier
when it is finished, sends it up by the Carrier
to <HI>London,</HI> to Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI>
Factor to be sold. Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the Factor, sells
it to Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Draper: Mr. <HI>B.</HI>
the Woollen-Draper, sells it to Mr. <HI>C.</HI> Shop-Keeper
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and he cuts it out in
his Shop, and sells it to <HI>D</HI>—<HI>E</HI>—Es{que}
a Country Gentleman, and other Gentlemen
about him, to make them new Suits of
Cloaths, and so they are the last Consumers;
<PB N="112" REF="124"/>
also 'tis sent down by the Carrier from <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
to <HI>Northampton.</HI></P>
<P>NOW between the <HI>Wiltshire</HI> Clothier and
the <HI>Northampton</HI> Shop-Keeper, here are no
less than four important Families of Trades∣men,
who get their Living, and, perhaps, in
Time grow rich by their Business, in the ne∣gotiating,
as I may call it, this Piece of
Cloth.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE Carrier from <HI>Warminster</HI> to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
his Pay comes to, perhaps, 5 <HI>s. per</HI>
Cloth, which is Two Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard
upon the Cloth at Market.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Mr. <HI>A.</HI> the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factor has
his Commission at two and a half
<HI>per Cent.</HI> which if this Cloth be sold
for fifteen Shillings a Yard, amounts
to Four Pence Half-Penny <HI>per</HI> Yard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Draper, selling
it to Mr. <HI>C.</HI> the Shop-Keeper at <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI>
and giving him, perhaps, six
to nine Months Credit, he cannot afford
to get less than Nine Pence or a Shilling
<HI>per</HI> Yard by him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THE <HI>Northampton</HI> Carrier for Carriage,
must have something, suppose about
Three Half-Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard for Carriage,
all which amounts to One Shilling and
Eight Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard Advance upon
the Cloth.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="113" REF="125"/>
BUT now here is Mr. <HI>F. G.</HI> another Shop-sKeeper
at <HI>Northampton,</HI> and perhaps an
Alderman, a rich over-grown Tradesman;
and he having more Money than his Neigh∣bours,
and wanting no Credit, but prying
about into all the Secrets of the Trade, he finds
out where these Cloths are made, and away goes
he to <HI>Warminster</HI> directly; and there finding
out the Clothier, or perhaps two or three
Clothiers, he settles a Correspondence with
them, buys his Goods there, and has them
brought directly by Horse-Packs to <HI>Nor∣thampton;</HI>
and perhaps paying Ready Mo∣ney,
tempts the Clothier to sell it him a
Penny <HI>per</HI> Yard cheaper too than his Factor
sold it at <HI>London</HI> to the Woollen-Draper.</P>
<P>BY this Means, the following Incidents
happen in Trade, and the following Advan∣tages,
to the rich Shop-Keeper at <HI>Northamp∣ton.</HI></P>
<P>1.
The Carriage from <HI>Warminster</HI> to <HI>Nor∣thampton</HI>
he must pay, which being a little
farther than to <HI>London,</HI> and out of the ordi∣nary
Road, may amount to Two Pence a
Yard upon the Cloth, but the Man buying,
perhaps, three or four Horse-Packs at a
Time, he has it carried cheap; and finding
Ways, perhaps, to load the Horses out with
Wool, sill by the Strength of his great Stock
he makes his Advantage both Ways, and
gains so much, that the Carriage of his
Wool and his Cloth costs him nothing, for
<PB N="114" REF="126"/>
he sends the Clothier the Wool, and brings
the Cloth back.</P>
<P>THUS he has his Cloth Two Shillings and
Six Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard cheaper than his Neigh∣bour
Shop-Keeper, and by selling it so much
cheaper to <HI>D. E.</HI> Es{que} and others, he gets
all their Custom from his poor Neighbour
Tradesman, who can sell to no Body but
such People, as perhaps being in his Books,
must buy of him, because they owe him
Money.</P>
<P>BUT this is not all: For this Mr. <HI>F. G.</HI>
of <HI>Northampton,</HI> buying thus of the Clo∣thier,
here is the Carrier of <HI>Warminster</HI> sunk
out of Trade; he is supplanted, and the Man
and his Horses put out of their Employment,
and the <HI>Northampton</HI> Carrier likewise. Mr. <HI>A.</HI>
the <HI>Blackwell-Hall</HI> Factor, also loses his Em∣ploy,
aud may sit and blow his Fingers for
want of Trade. Mr. <HI>B.</HI> the Woollen-Dra∣per,
lose shis Trade too, and he having a great
Family, and sitting at a high Rent, is ruin'd
by the Loss of his wholesale Trade, so he runs
out, breaks, and is undone. Thus the Channel
of Trade is turn'd, the Stream is cut off, and all
the Families that were before employ'd (be∣tween
them) are cut out of their Business,
and turn'd loose in the World to get their
Bread some other Way, or perhaps want it.</P>
<P>AND what's all the Benefit which is made by
this Spoil upon Trade? only this, That 'Squire
<HI>D—E—</HI> of <HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> buys his
<PB N="115" REF="127"/>
Suits of Cloths half a Crown a Yard cheap∣er;
which is of no great Concern to him, nor
does he value it, or is it of any moment in
Proportion to the Wounds which Trade re∣ceives
by it, in all the Particulars mentioned
above.</P>
<P>THIS is cutting off the Circulation of Trade;
this is managing Trade with a few Hands;
and if this Practise, which is indeed evident∣ly
begun, was come to be universal, a Mil∣lion
of People in <HI>England</HI> that now live
handfomely by Trade, would be destitute of
Employment, and their Families in Time
might want Bread.</P>
<P>NOR in Conclusion, would the Gentlemen
or last Consumers be better'd by it all; for
this Want of Employment, would in the
End, drive away the People, and the Mouths
would be wanting for the Bread, as well as
the Bread for the Mouths; the Growth of the
Land not being consumed, the Rents must
fall of Course, and so the Mischief would
circulate, as the Trade should have done.
Certainly the Gentlemen find their Interest in
the Dearness of the Manufacture, if it may
be call'd Dearness, whether they will see it,
or no; 'tis highly their Advantage to have
Multitudes of People upon their Lands, and
nothing can keep the People together like
something that can find them Employment.</P>
<P>THERE is another Fundamental in the Pros∣perity
of a Nation, which will never fail to
<PB N="116" REF="128"/>
be true, <HI>viz.</HI> that no Land is fully improv'd,
'till it is made to yield its utmost Increase:
But if our Lands should be made to
yield their utmost Increase, and your
People cannot consume the Increase, or fo∣reign
Trade take it off your Hands, 'tis
then no Increase to us, and must not be pro∣duced;
so that the Lands must be laid down,
that is to say, a certain Proportion of them,
and left to bear no Corn, or feed no Cattle,
because your Produce is too great for your
Consumption.</P>
<P>HENCE 'tis a certain and unquestioned Bene∣fit
to a Nation to increase the Number of Peo∣ple,
that they may consume the Product of the
Land. But then take it with you as you go,
that this is supposed to be an Increase of such
People as can not only consume the Provisions,
but can pay for them too; for an Increase of
Beggars is no Increase at all in Sense of Trade.</P>
<P>AND how shall the Numbers of such Peo∣ple
be increas'd, but by finding Employment
for them? Let any Experiment of this kind
be referr'd to, let any Man erect a Manufacture
in a Village, where there are but few Inha∣bitants;
if that Manufature goes on, and
there are Wages to be paid constant, and
Work to be had, there will soon be People:
Where Business leads, the People always
follow. If People did not come in imme∣diately,
being kept out by Parish Laws,
they would soon increase by those who had
<PB N="117" REF="129"/>
or could obtain legal Settlements, staying all
at home; whereas where there is no con∣stant
Employment, the People scatter and
disperse, and seek Settlements where they
can get Employment.</P>
<P>THUS you see wherever there are Manu∣facture,
there are always Crowds of People;
the Towns grow populous, and are throng'd
with working Poor till they grow rich, and,
as it were, innumerable. Thus it is in the
West Riding of <HI>Yorkshire;</HI> thus in <HI>Norfolk,</HI>
about <HI>Norwich,</HI> and the Country round; at
<HI>Exeter,</HI> and all over the County of <HI>Devon;</HI>
and the like in other Parts: Wherever the
Trade is, there are the People.</P>
<P>THE Consequence of this, is, that where
these populous Towns are, the Country can∣not
produce enough to feed them; but they
buy the Provisions from the neighbouring
Provinces or Counties.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, where there are no Ma∣nufactures,
there's no Employ for the People;
where the Inhabitants are, only Landlord
and Tenant, there the People cannot con∣sume
the Product of the Earth; and did
not the next or neighbouring Counties take
off their Corn and Cattle, the poor Far∣mers
and Tenants would not know what to
do with them, or how to pay their Rent.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is the Support of the whole
Community, employs the People, keeps them
at home, and in Throngs together, by which
<PB N="118" REF="130"/>
the Produce of the Country is consum'd, which
is the Life of the whole Country. It is cer∣tain,
that were it not for Trade, the People
of <HI>England</HI> would not be able to consume the
Provisions which the Land produces; and
even as it is, they could not do it, were it
not that great Quantities of Corn are every
Year exported into foreign Countries:
Should a large and good Crop, and a sea∣sonable
Harvest come in, and no Demand
for Corn come from abroad, 'tis hard to ex∣press
what our Case in <HI>England</HI> should be;
and though 'tis an Expression which may at
first Sight appear strange, yet it is actually
so, we should be curs'd with Plenty.</P>
<P>THERE was a Time, when this was more
sensibly felt in <HI>England,</HI> perhaps than in
most Part of <HI>Europe, viz.</HI> in the Year 1680.
to the Revolution, a small Interval of one
Piece of a Year of Drought excepted. There
was during those Years, an uninterrupted
Series of Plenty, not in <HI>England</HI> only, but
in all the neighbouring Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI>
so that we had not only a great Plenty at
Home, but no Demand from abroad.</P>
<P>THE Consequence of this was, that the
best Wheat was sold at the great Markets
near <HI>London,</HI> such as <HI>Farnham, Dartford,
Hemsted, Hertford, Hitchin,</HI> and other
known Markets, at from Sixteen to Eighteen
Shillings <HI>per</HI> Quarter; and farther off, as in
<HI>Northamptonshire</HI> and <HI>Bedfordshire, Hamp∣shire.
<PB N="119" REF="131"/>
Sussex,</HI> and Places of the like Distance,
at Thirteen to Fourteen <HI>per</HI> Quarter.</P>
<P>AND as this Cheapness held for so many
Years, what was the Consequence of it?
Truly this, That all the Farmers in <HI>England,</HI>
generally speaking, were in a sinking Con∣dition;
many broke and blew up every
Year; and it was impossible that those who
depended upon nothing but their Labour,
and the Crop, could pay the Rent. I remem∣ber
to have seen a Farmer who had twenty
Acres of good Wheat, a fair and flourishing
Crop, yet when it came to Market, it would
not pay for the Seed, the Husbandry, the
Harvesting, and Threshing, and Carriage
to Market, all the Rent of the Land sunk,
and to be paid out of his dead Stock.</P>
<P>NOR was the Goodness of the Crop any
Advantage to the poor Farmer; but the
more Corn the more Charge of Reaping,
Housing, Threshing, Cleaning, and Carry∣ing
to Market; and where the Price was so
small, it could ill pay those Charges, except
that oftentimes the poor Man did most of
that Work himself.</P>
<P>HAD this continued till now, most of the Far∣mers
all over <HI>England</HI> had been Beggars;
the Farms would in most Places have been
thrown up, and the Landlords must have
turn'd Plowmen, or, which is what I men∣tioned
above, the Rent of Lands must have
sunk extremely low, which is, in short,
<PB N="120" REF="132"/>
sinking the Fee-Simple, and reducing the
Estates of the Gentry all over the Nation.</P>
<P>THOSE that enter into these Particulars,
may, with me, make this useful Observa∣tion,
namely, that 'tis Trade alone that can
remedy this Evil: Employing Numbers of
People secures the Consumption of the Pro∣duce,
and that keeps up the Price, and by
consequence the Rate of the Lands: This
keeping up the Price of the Produce, enables
the Farmer to pay his Rent. If our Manu∣factures
were so increas'd by Trade, that
they could maintain more People than the
Land could feed, and that, <HI>as the</HI> Dutch <HI>do
at this Time,</HI> we were obliged to fetch all
our Corn, or great Part of it from abroad,
it would most certainly be an Advantage to
the Publick, and the Rent of Lands would
rise in Proportion.</P>
<P>IT would be a long and useful Discourse,
if I could digress to it, to shew how great
and real an Advantage keeping up the Rent
is to the Wealth and Strength of the Nation;
all your Taxes are rated upon it, your Pro∣portions
form'd from it, your Militia raised
by it, your Poor's Rates and Surveyors
Rates, and every other Thing of Parish Pro∣portion
taxed by it.</P>
<P>THE more the Rate of Lands, the more
your Land-Tax pays to the Publick, and
yet without Loss to the Landlord, but on
the contrary, greatly to his Gain; and the
<PB N="121" REF="133"/>
more the Land-Tax brings in, the less Need
of Levies by other <HI>Ways and Means;</HI> the
more your Land-Tax raises, the more the
Strength of the Nation is tried, the Go∣vernment
is enabled to raise the more Forces.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as the raising the Rents and
Rates of Lands is an Addition to the Strength
of the Nation, so the increasing the Num∣ber
of People, that is to say, of such Peo∣ple
as are able to work and maintain them∣selves,
still increases the Strength; for the
more Hands the more Strength, and the
more Mouths the more Wealth; because
every Mouth helps to consume the Growth,
supposing the Hands still to pay for what
the Mouth consumes; for you must always
take it with you, that Multitudes of Alms∣taking
Poor, Numbers of Beggars do nothing.</P>
<P>THIS would be a Digression, if I was to
go on with it: But as it stops here, and is
turn'd short upon the Subject in hand, it is
extremely to the Purpose, thus, <HI>viz.</HI> that
all this is done by Trade, and by Trade
only.</P>
<P>TRADE maintains Multitudes, and in∣creases
them by the Consequence of their
Labour.</P>
<P>TRADE raises Towns, Cities, and popu∣lous
Villages, by bringing the People toge∣ther
to particular Places, where the Com∣merce
fixes, and where the Manufactures
are fix'd.</P>

TRADE employs the People, and pays
them Wages for their Labour.</P>
<P>TRADE increases by those People con∣suming
and wearing the Manufactures they
make, as well as the Provisions they buy.</P>
<P>THUS Trade is a publick Benefit; and, in
a word, the Wealth of Families, the Rates
of Lands, and the Strength of the Nation
depend all upon Trade.</P>
<P>AS Trade then is a publick Benefit, the
Tradesmen are a publick Blessing; for they
are the Men that carry it on; or, as I observ'd
before, may very well be said to DRIVE the
Trade; they manage it, they keep it up to
its Rules and Regulations; they keep up
the Value of the Manufacture, and the Re∣putation
of the Manufacturer; for 'tis plain
the Credit of the Manufacturer is maintain'd
by the Goodness of his Manufacture.</P>
<P>AND here I shall just mention it, though
I shall speak more largely to it elsewhere:
It is not always the Interest of Trade to
have the Manufacture be brought down to
a low Price, especially if the Goodness of
the Goods sinks with the Rate: But to keep
up the Manufacture to its Goodness, though
the Price be higher than its Neighbours, is
a Credit to the Manufacture, and to the
Nation that make them, let them come from
what Part of the World they will.</P>
<P>IT was urg'd by some, who suggested that
our Manufacture of Broad Cloth will be out
<PB N="123" REF="135"/>
done by the <HI>French,</HI> that we shall lose our
<HI>Turky</HI> Trade, the <HI>French</HI> selling their
Cloaths cheaper at <HI>Smyrna</HI> and at <HI>Aleppo</HI>
than the <HI>English;</HI> and that because Cheapness
always causes Consumption, and the <HI>French</HI>
Cloths were cheaper, therefore we should
not sell our Cloths till all the <HI>French</HI> were
gone.</P>
<P>BUT Experience has prov'd the contrary;
the <HI>French</HI> Cloths feel as fine, look as well,
the Colours are dyed as good, the Cloth∣workers
Part was perform'd as well, for the
Cloths were well dress'd; in a word, they
look'd every Way as good, and perhaps at first
had some Advantage, and went well off.</P>
<P>BUT when they came to wear, the Con∣sumer
presently found the Advantage; as the
<HI>English</HI> Cloth weighed twenty to thirty, to for∣ty
Pound a Bale more than the <HI>French</HI> at the
Scale; so in the wearing there was no Compa∣rison:
The <HI>French</HI> wore like Druggets, rough
and woolly; the <HI>English</HI> like Velvet, smooth
and solid: The <HI>French</HI> wore <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appy and coarse,
the <HI>English</HI> wore soft and fine: The <HI>French</HI>
wore into Rags, and wore out; the <HI>English</HI>
wore firm and lasting, even to the Thread:
And what followed, the Consequence was
plain.</P>
<P><Q><P>THE <HI>English</HI> Cloth obtain'd Credit, and
increased it by its real Worth.</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="136"/>
THE <HI>French</HI> Cloth lost its Credit, and
declined by the Value appearing to lose:
And what follow'd?</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> Cloth, though dearer, went
always off, and was sold first.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> Cloth, though cheaper, lay
on hand, and would seldom sell while
there was any <HI>English</HI> Cloth to be
had.</P></Q>
SO that it is not always that a lower priced
Manufacture goes best off.</P>
<P>THERE is a great Difference between dear
and high-priced, or cheap and low-priced;
Goods may be high-priced, and not dear,
low-priced, and not cheap; the Rates of all
Goods are to be measur'd by their Good∣ness
or Badness; and 'tis therefore the Inte∣rest
of Tradesmen to keep up the Goodness
and Value of their Goods, and then the
Price, though higher than others, may be
lower in Proportion: But of this also I may
speak more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>IT is, however, to the Purpose here, thus,
<HI>viz.</HI> That to keep up the Goodness of a
Manufacture is not only the way to keep
up its Rate at Market, but by that to keep
up the Wages of the Workmen; and it is of
the utmost Consequence to keep up the Rate
of the Wages of the Poor, if it can be done,
upon many Accounts too long to dwell upon
here.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="137"/>
BY the Height of Wages the Rate of all
Things are supported; the Price of Provi∣sions
are in the first Place maintain'd by it;
by the Price of Provisions the Rent of Lands
are kept up, and by the Rent of Lands the
Estates of the Nobility and Gentry, and the
whole landed Interest are supported, and
the publick Stock of the Nation kept up,
and improved as above.</P>
<P>UPON this Account, and from the whole
of what has been said, it appears, that 'tis
absolutely necessary to keep up the Rate of
our Manufactures to as good a Price as the
Reason of the Thing will allow: When I
say it is absolutely necessary, I mean it is so
in the Language of Trade; it is absolutely
necessary to the Prosperity of Trade,
and therefore let none trouble us or them∣selves
with the less necessary Cavil at the
Words absolutely necessary; if they do,
we shall disregard it: 'Tis the Thing, not
the Words that we are laying the Weight
upon; and I must be understood to speak
in the Language of Trade, which is the Sub∣ject
I am speaking of, and I make these
Cautions here once for all, that I may not
trouble myself or the Reader any more with
such Criticisms in the Reading.</P>
<Q><P>1. IT may be said in the Language of
Trade, that a Man <HI>cannot do</HI> a Thing
which he cannot do to his Gain; a
<PB N="126" REF="138"/>
Tradesman cannot sell his Goods at
such a Price, that is to say, he cannot
to save or gain by them: He has Goods
in his Hands to dispose of for a Manu∣facturer,
or for any Employer, and he
writes him word he cannot sell them,
that is, he cannot sell them but to Loss,
or at the Price he is limited to.</P>
<P>HE is to send Goods to <HI>Bristol,</HI> but he
cannot send them by such a Carrier,
that is, he cannot send them so cheap
as he can by such another.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman leaves off a particular
Trade or Trading to a particular Place;
why he answers, he can trade in such
Goods no longer, or he cannot trade to
such a Place any more; the Reason is,
he cannot do it without Loss.</P>
<P>HE cannot trade in such Goods, for he
can get nothing by them.</P>
<P>SUCH and such People can supply such a
Market cheaper than he can afford it,
they living near to the Place, and for
that Reason he can trade there no lon∣ger.</P>
<P>THAT cannot be done in Trade which
cannot be done to Advantage; for Gain
is the End of Commerce to the Mer∣chant,
as Supply of Necessaries is the
End of it to the Consumer.</P>
<P>2. THAT Thing is absolutely necessary to
a Trade, which it is not to be carried
<PB N="127" REF="139"/>
on profitably without: For Example,
Ships, Seamen, and the Water are ab∣solutely
necessary for carrying on the
Coal-Trade from <HI>Newcastle</HI> to <HI>London;</HI>
the Water is absolutely necessary to the
Ships, the Ships absolutely necessary
to the Seamen, and all of them abso∣lutely
necessary to the Trade; because
the Coals could not be sold without the
Market, the Market not supplied with∣out
Ships to carry them, the Ships could
not float without the Water, the Water
could not guide them without the Sai∣lors
and Pilots.</P>
<P>SHIPS are necessary to the Coal-Trade
as Food is necessary to Life: In like
Cases, therefore, when I say in Matters
of Trade such or such Things are ab∣solutely
necessary, I am to be under∣stood
that they are so when they are
necessary to the Prosperity of Trade.</P></Q>
<P>HAVING thus enter'd those preliminary
Cautions, as I said, once for all, I return
to the Subject where I left off, namely, that
it is absolutely necessary in Trade to keep up
our Manufacture to as good a Price, that is,
to as high a Rate as the Nature and Reason
of the Thing will allow; the Reasons are
plain, because, as the Manufactures sink in
Price, Wages abate to the Poor, Provisions
must abate in the Market, and Rents must
<PB N="128" REF="140"/>
sink, and abate to the Landlords, Taxes and
Pound-Rates sink to the Publick, and the
whole Stock of the Nation abates in
its Value. Ishall explain this in the next
Chapter, and distinguish it from several ex∣ceptionable
Cases.</P>

<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That a rich over-grown Tradesman should
not by Engrossings, Combinations, and other
illegal Practices in Trade, oppress and
endeavour to ruin young Beginners.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">N</SEG>Othing is more frequent among
Tradesmen than to supplant and
underwork one another in their
Business, by sinking or abating the
Value or Price of the Goods they sell, that
is, in a word, to <HI>under-sell</HI> one another, to
carry away the Trade.</P>
<P>THIS is a Thing so big with Mischiefs, so
complicated in trading Craft, and the Particu∣lars
so little known or considered by the Peo∣ple
that go that Way to work, that I doubt
not the honest Tradesman will be thankful
to be let into the Consequences of it, and
at least to see how it affects him: But first,
<PB N="129" REF="141"/>
I must state the Case, and enquire into the
Persons.</P>
<P>THERE are two or three Sorts of Trades∣men
that undersel their Goods:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. YOUNG Tradesmen, newly set up;
and they do it to get a Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. RICH old Tradesmen, who have over-grown
Stocks; and they do it to keep
their Trade.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Poor Tradesmen, who are obliged to
sell to raise Money.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> YOUNG Tradesmen, newly set up,
and who think by selling cheap they shall
get a Trade, and bring Custom to their Shop:
It is true the Pretence is specious and fair;
but the Thing in itself is foul and unfair,
and in the End is ruinous to the Trade and
to the Tradesman also.</P>
<Q><P>1. IT is a Fraud in icself; for 'tis only
deceiving the Customers you invite,
who you draw in to come to your Shop,
perswading them to believe they shall
always buy cheaper of you than of
other People; whereas your Defign is
to make yourself Amends upon them
afterwards, and at least not to continue to
sellthem so cheap for a Constancy, as they
call it. Thus I knew, or perhaps I might
say know, a certain Shop-Keeper that,
<PB N="130" REF="142"/>
to invite a Lady to his Shop, promised
to sell her considerably cheaper than
she should buy any where else in <HI>Lon∣don;</HI>
and accordingly surpriz'd her by
selling her a Suit of Cloaths near two
Shillings a Yard cheaper, than he sold
the same Silk to another Lady before
her Face.</P>
<P>IT was hardly possible but that finding
herself so kindly us'd, she should go
again to his Shop, and not only go
herself, but carry her Friends there too:
But the Tradesman, who kept his Account
very well in his Head, did not forget
to make himself Satisfaction in his next
Bargain for the Loss in his sist, and
she paid sufficiently for it in what she
bought next, not in the Price, so much
as in the Goodness of what she bought.
If it is objected, that then she need not
have bought; I answer, that is no suf∣ficient
Objection, because 'tis to be sup∣posed
that the Lady, by being so ex∣ceedingly
well used at first, might, no
question, come into the Shop prepos∣sess'd
a little in the Mercer's Favour,
and with a Belief, that he would use her
well at least, though perhaps he could
not use her so very well as he did
before. One is apt to speak well of the
Bridge that carries us well over, and
<PB N="131" REF="143"/>
to expect good Pennyworths To-day,
where we had such good Usage Yester∣day;
and so the Party is at least the
easier to to be cheated.</P>
<P>BUT in the next Place, it is not so easy for a
Customer to avoid being cheated in the
Goods, as it may be to avoid being im∣posed
upon in the Price. The Price is
generally a little known, or with∣in
a little to be guessed at; but the
Goodness of the Goods are not so easi∣ly,
at least not so nicely judg'd of
or distinguish'd by the Buyer; their
Judgment cannot be so good as the
Tradesman's, who knows the Making
of them, and perhaps might himself fur∣nish
the Materials; He is capable of
some certain Frauds in that Part, which
it is impossible for the Buyer to know,
or at least to discover, till the Wear∣ing,
and till the Experience comes to
bear Witness for them; and then the
Tradesman never fails to put it off by
saying he is very sorry for it, that he
thought it an extraordinary Piece, and
by adding a more fatal Wheedle, <HI>viz.</HI>
that he will make you Amends when
you please to want any Thing else;
and when the Lady comes again, he
does do it perhaps a little, to carry on
the Bite, and so alternately cheats her
and abates, and abates and cheats her
<PB N="132" REF="144"/>
successively, till one Time with another
he makes himself even with her, and
makes her even with him too; Thus he
secures her Custom, and has her fast to
his Shop; after which she is like other
Customers to him, and they deal as
well as they can together.</P></Q>
<P>THIS is a Piece of Shop-Keeping Craft,
and there's no great Matter in it; no more
indeed is there in the young Shop-Keeper's
selling cheap at his first Opening; it is his
Interest, and the Buyer is even with him in
the Trick of it; for as they say, Every one
has a Penny for a new Shop: The Reason is
this; People always think the new Shop∣keeper
will sell cheaper than ordinary, to
oblige and get Trade, and so they go there
to have (as they call it) some of his good
Pennyworths, though perhaps they never
intend to come again. So the Shop-Keeper
sells cheaper than his Neighbours, to engage
them to his Shop, though he never designs
to use them so again, but, like the Mer∣cer,
to make himself even with them when
they are become Customers to his Shop.</P>
<P>AND thus the Customers bite the Shop∣keeper,
by telling him that they intend to
be constant to his Shop, if he sells them
cheap; that is to say, if he will sell his
Goods cheaper than he can afford, they will
come and buy, and help to ruin him. On the
<PB N="133" REF="145"/>
other hand, he tells them, that he does sell
them cheaper than he can afford, in hopes
to engage them to the Shop, that is to say,
in hopes he may have an Opportunity to
pick their Pockets another Time; so they go
on, according to a Piece of modern <HI>Latin,</HI>
(if you please to accept of it) of my rude
making, <HI>Qui sharpat sharpabitur.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> BUT to leave this little petty Fraud
of Underselling to get a Trade, which is only
less hurtful than others, because it goes a
less Way, and is but of a short Continu∣ance:
There is another that is more fatal in
its Consequence, and that as it is of a greater
Magnitude; and this is when the rich over-grown
Tradefman undersels to keep his
Trade, to prevent young Beginners setting
up by him, and to break others that are al∣ready
trading within his Reach. And this is
fatal many Ways:
<Q><P>1. TIS fatal to the poorer and little Dea∣lers
about him; for they stand still,
with their Fingers in their Mouths, as
we call it, or walk about at their Shop
Doors, and have nothing to do, while
they see all the Trade run in the great
Channel of their neighbouring Alder∣man's
Shop; who gives large Credit at
a Ready-Money Price, or sells for Rea∣dy
Money Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> cheaper than
<PB N="134" REF="146"/>
they can; so that they are undone of
Course, have a high Rent to pay, and
no Trade, and the great over-grown
Dealer gets all the Business.</P>
<P>2. BUT this is not all: This over-grown
Dealer out-buys them too; for being,
as is noted, full of Money, he watches
all possible Advantages of Buying; lies
ready when a poor Manufacturer has
a great Stock of Goods on his Hands,
and cannot sell them, or wants Money,
and perhaps must sell them; and then
he buys at an Under-Price, and by
oppressing the Maker, on one hand,
he makes him able to oppress his Neigh∣bour
Shop-Keepers on the other; for he
that underbuys, can be sure to undersel.</P></Q></P>
<P>NOR is this all; the Mischief does not
end here: He is not content to run down
the poor Tradesman that lives near him by
underselling, and oppressing here and there
a Manufacturer by hard buying, but he does
the same in its kind by all the Manufacturers
who he employs; for he will buy nothing
but with the utmoft grinding, and screwing;
Beating them down to the lowest Pitch of li∣ving,
and even below living; till they are so
far from letting a Tradesman or Workman
live under them, that, as a poor Clothier
said to Sir—, a known hard Buyer in
<PB N="135" REF="147"/>
the City, he will hardly give them leave
to starve under him.</P>
<P>NOW, as the Consequence of this goes
farther than what I was speaking of before,
so it is more fatal; for,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THIS Method is not only fatal to
the poor Clothier, but, in a word, 'tis fatal to
the Clothing, 'tis injurious to the Trade
itself, and ruins not the Clothier, but the
Nation; the whole Country feels the Blow,
like an Earthquake, which does not shake
this or that particular Town or Village only,
but gives a Shock to the whole Country.
For Example,</P>
<P>THE Clothier having sold this great
Merchant a large Quantity of Goods very
low, and engaging with him to supply him
all the Year in proportion to the same Price;
the first Effect of this is, that the Merchant
casts off all the Clothiers who he dealt with
before, or at least those who made that Sort of
Goods before, unless they will sell at the
same Price, which he makes to be perhaps
five or ten Shillings upon a Cloth lower than
formerly.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> OTHER Merchants in <HI>London,</HI>
who are Buyers of the same Goods, (sup∣posing
they do not at first know the parti∣cular
Case or Reason of it,) finding an
Alteration, that the Clothiers hang about
them, and that they cannot sell their Goods, and
that the Hall or the Factors Warehouses are
<PB N="136" REF="148"/>
full of Goods, piled up, as is sometimes the
Case: The Merchants, I say, seeing the Clo∣thiers
importuning them for a Market, fail
not to make their Advantage, and to screw
them down to an Abatement, and the Clo∣thier
rather than not sell, and wanting Money
too to pay their Spinners and Workfolks in
the Country, are forc'd to comply; and thus
by degrees the Goods are sunk at Market:
For Example; suppose,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The white Cloths made at <HI>Cirencester</HI>
usually sold at Six Pound <HI>per</HI> Piece Rea∣dy
Money, are now brought down to
Five Pound Ten Shillings <HI>per</HI> Piece,
three Months or six Months Credit, and
to Five Pound Ready Money.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. FINE <HI>Medley</HI> Cloths of <HI>Trowbridge</HI> or
<HI>Warminster,</HI> at Fourteen or Fifteen Shil∣lings
<HI>per</HI> Yard, brought down by the same
Rule to Thirteen or Fourteen Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Yard.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. DU-Roys of <HI>Taunton</HI> and the Towns
round it, from Twenty Seven Shillings
<HI>per</HI> Piece, to Twenty Four Shillings.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. FINE Druggets of <HI>Devizes,</HI> or of
<HI>Bristol,</HI> from Eighteen Pence <HI>per</HI> Yard,
Fifteen Pence.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Shaloons of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> or of the West
Country, in Proportion.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND thus indeed of all the several
Woollen Manufactures of one kind or ano∣ther
<PB N="137" REF="149"/>
throughout <HI>England;</HI> for the Case is
the same in one Thing as in another, from
this over-rich Buyer running down the poor
Clothiers, and driving them away to seek
a Market; they on the other hand are sent
hawking about to other Merchants or Buyers,
or forc'd to borrow Money of the Factor,
which is the same Thing; (for at last he un∣dersels
their Goods to pay himself,) and thus
at length all the Buyers seeing a Glut of
Goods, run down the Price, and the whole
Market sinks upon their Hands.</P>
<P>THIS is one Step to Ruin.</P>
<P>BUT it does not end here; for the Clo∣thier
pinch'd in Price, and not able to live
at the Rate he is now oblig'd to sell at,
comes down into the Country, and the first
Thing he does is, to slack his Hand in Quan∣tity,
and make less; The Consequence
of this is, that he dismisses so many Looms,
and turns off so many Spinners; so there
in the first Place the Employment of the
Poor is shorten'd, and the Trade in general
is abated.</P>
<P>THE poor Weavers and Spinners go to
seek other Masters; but by this Time the
rest of the Clothiers finding the Market sink
as above, are in the same Condition, and they
won't take on more Workfolk, when, as it
happens, they had rather too many before,
and in a little while they are fain to do just
the same Thing, <HI>viz.</HI> turn off their Weavers
and Spinners too.</P>
<P><PB N="138" REF="150"/>
THE Poor being thus pinch'd, have these
several Recourses.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To Abatement,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To Charity,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Fly from their Misery,</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Go to Jail.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>THUS the Ruin reaches the Labourer; for
as it is with the Master, so it must be with
the Servant.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> TO Abatement of Price: As it was
with the Clothier, rather work starvingly
than not work at all; rather pinch than pe∣rish;
the Wages abate, and the Poor suffer:
As their Pay sinks, they are obliged to pinch,
fare hard, feed coarse, be cloath'd in Rags,
and the like: And what follows this? the
Price of Provisions must follow the Price
of Wages; for as the Poor have Money, or
not Money, so they must buy, or not buy
in the Market: 'Tis true they must not,
they cannot starve; but they must abate,
and feed as (I say) coarse, and fare harder;
and by this Means Provisions, which for∣merly
went off well, come back from the
Market unsold: The Butcher, which kill'd
three Sheep for a Market-Day, kills but
two; and others, that killed a Bullock
for a Market-Day in the Country, perhaps,
kill a Bullock between three or four of
them.</P>
<P><PB N="139" REF="151"/>
THUS abating the Labour of the Poor,
and sinking their Wages, affects the Markets,
and the Consumption of Provisions abates;
but I must go thro' the rest of the Articles
too, for they all end at the same Point.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> WANT of Work oppressing the
labouring Poor, they fly from their Misery;
(like <HI>Hagar,</HI> that could not see the Death of
the Child,) they run away: A poor Man
cannot see his Wife and Children starve;
if he could work and relieve them, he would
stay, and be willing to labour with all his
Heart; but his Master the Clothier, who
employ'd him, has put him off, has no Work
for him; and he has tried all the other Mas∣ters
in the Town, and the Case is the same;
they have all more Workmen than they can
employ, for the Market declines; or if they
would employ them, they must abate their
Wages; so that with his utmost Labour he
can but just keep himself from starving, not
being able to get any Thing for a Wife and
three, four, or five poor Children; and
this makes the Man distracted: He cannot
feed them; He cannot bear to hear them
cry for Bread, and have none to give them.
Indeed, who could? So the Man runs away
in Despair, lists for a Soldier, goes to Sea,
or any Thing but starve, and the Conse∣quence
is this:
<Q><PB N="140" REF="152"/>
<P>1. THE Market, as I said before, is so
much lessen'd, as the Provision that
Man eat before amounted to; that's a
plain Case;. and if this should be, or
suppose this to be but a hundred or
two hundred in a whole County, such
as <HI>Essex,</HI> which is a manfacturing Coun∣ty;
and if it goes on, it may be many
hundred; the Consumption of Provi∣sions
in that County sinks in Proportion,
and the Effect of that I am to speak
to by itself.</P>
<P>2. BUT if this Man can possibly get a little
Work, he will; and rather than see his
Family perish, as above, he gets in where
he can, though he supplants another;
and that he obtains by offering to work
cheaper; and so another Family is turn∣ed
out of Work; then the Weaver of
that other Family, rather than starve
too, does the same; and thus the Men,
it may be, keep their Work, but sink
their Pay; and as this is, more or less,
so the poor Family is more or less
distress'd, and are oblig'd to fare the
harder, and buy the less or the worse
Provisions in the Market; so the Effect
is the same; and besides which, this
brings on the third Article, <HI>viz.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> CHARITY. If the Man is not able
to maintain his Family, the Parish must:
<PB N="141" REF="153"/>
Perhaps the Wages he gain'd before was but
just enough: One Pair of Hands to work, and
three or four Pair of Mouths to feed, seven or
eight Backs to cloath, with House-Rent and
Fire, what can the poor Man do? he had
just enough to do before, and now his
Wages are abated, perhaps, so much upon a
Piece, as may amount to two, or three, or
four Shillings a Week upon his Labour,
and in proportion as much upon the Spin∣ning,
which was his Wife's Labour; and
this brings the Family into Distress, and they
have nothing to do but to make their Case
known to the Parish, and they must relieve
them: This is, in case, the poor Man stays,
and works under an Abatement of Wages.</P>
<P>BUT if the Man, not able to stay to see
the Misery of his Family, runs away, lists
into the Army, or goes to Sea: Then the
Wife and Children comes to the Parish whol∣ly,
and lie upon them, not to help, but to
keep; and the Consequence of this also I
must speak to by itself.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> BUT there is yet another Shift;
and this is the same in its Consequences eve∣ry
Way, but rather more miserable to the
Family: The poor Man, not able to maintain
his Family by his Labour, now the Price or
Wages of his Work is sunk and abated, shifts
as long as ever he can, goes on Trust at the
<PB N="142" REF="154"/>
Chandler's Shop for Necessaries of one sort,
at the Apothecary's for another; here for
Food, there for Physick; at the Baker's for
Bread, at the Alehouse for Drink, till no
Body will credit him any farther; and being
not able to pay what he owes already, the
Baker arrests him, and that being known,
the Alehouse-Keeper loads him with his
Action too, and so the rest; and the poor
Creature is carried to Gaol: There he can
neither work at one Price or another, but
begs at the Grate, and the first cold Winter
is starved, and dies in the Prison: The Fa∣mily
are to be sure, on this sad Occasion, in
the utmost Distress; and, as in the Case be∣fore,
they fall wholly upon the Parish.</P>
<P>NOW let us sum up the Account: I could
run it a great Way farther, but 'tis needless,
the Fact is too plain. This happens so often,
no Man that understands Trade, need be sent
to ask another about it: The young Trades∣man
need not go, and ask his Father; or the
antient Tradesman rumage his Memory; and
for the Time when it was thus, 'tis even just
now upon us: And how many Tumults
have you had, and how many Riots, and
some Lives lost upon it? Nay, you are ob∣liged
to keep a Party of Horse in <HI>Colchester,</HI>
another at <HI>Froome,</HI> and another at <HI>Bradford,</HI>
at this very Time, to keep the Peace
among the Poor, and to make them acquiescc
<PB N="143" REF="155"/>
with their own Misery; as to the Numbers
it has driven from their Work, and the dis∣tress'd
Families that have been brought to the
Parishes by this means, let the People of the
Places inform you, who labour under the
Weight of it; and tho' the exquisite Manage∣ment
of the Inhabitants, whose Charge it has
been, keeps it down very much, yet 'tis a Load,
few Corporations in <HI>England</HI> could support.</P>
<P>THIS is some of the Effects of sinking the
Rate of our Manufacture; and who is the
better for all this? If it did indeed increase
the Consumption, as is the Case on many
other Occasions, according to the antient
Maxim in Trade, <HI>viz.</HI> that Cheapness causes
Consumption, something might be plead∣ed
for it; but this Part, which I have stated
among the Clothiers and their Dealers, is
not owing to a Stop or Decay of the fo∣reign
or domestick Commerce; tho' it cannot
be, indeed, when there is a quick Demand for
the Goods abroad: But 'tis here owing all
to the Avarice of the over-grown Trades∣man,
of whom I mentioned above, that he
would ruin his Neighbours; and so indeed
he would ruin the Country, in effect; for
every Thing that lowers the Rate of the
Poor's Wages, injures the Publick Stock.</P>
<P>I know a great Stir is made, about bring∣ing
our Manufacture to be as cheap abroad
as may be; that rival Nations, may not be
able to weaken us, or to undermine our
<PB N="144" REF="156"/>
Manufacture: And this I grant most readily;
but there are a hundred Ways to bring our
Manufacture down to a low Rate at a foreign
Market, besides that of running down the
Wages of the Maker, such as taking off all
Duties, and if need be, giving a Bounty on
the Exportation, to encourage it, which
Bounty might be levied again upon the Con∣sumption
at Home or many other Ways.</P>
<P>BESIDES sinking the Rate of the Wages,
is not the best Way to render the Manufac∣ture
cheap at the Markets abroad; my Rea∣sons
are brief, but sound.</P>
<P>EVERY Thing is dear or cheap, as it is in
Proportion good or bad, or as the Goodness
is proportioned to the Price.</P>
<P>THERE is a manifest Difference in Trade,
between cheap and low-priz'd: It is always
our Trading Interest, to have our Manufac∣ture
cheap in the foreign Markets; but it
may not be always our Trading Interest to
have them low-priz'd; they may be cheap,
tho' high-prized, if the Substance be rich, and
they may be dear tho' low-priz'd, if they are
mean in their Value. Now 'tis the Excellence
of the <HI>English</HI> Manufacture, that it is the best
in all the foreign Markets of the World, and
tho' the Price may be high, yet the Manufac∣ture
may be cheap; and it is so with our Goods
at this Time, and therefore it is, that the best
Buyers always call for our Manufactures a∣broad,
before those, either of <HI>France</HI> or <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
<PB N="145" REF="157"/>
or any other Countries, whether it be
in <HI>Spain,</HI> or in <HI>Italy,</HI> in <HI>Turky</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI>
or wherever you go.</P>
<P>IT is true, the English Woollen Manufac∣ture
bears the best Price in all the Markets
in the World: The Reason is plain; 'tis the
best of its kind, and, in Proportion to
its Goodness, is the cheapest too in the
World.</P>
<P>NOW if you would bring down the Wa∣ges
of the People that make it, whether it
be that of the Spinners or Weavers, or what∣ever
People you employ, what will be the
Consequence? You will lower the Price, 'tis
true, but then you will abate the Goodness
too; then you bring it to a Level with other
Country Clothing, and in short, ruin your
Manufacture, ruin its intrinsick Value, and
that will ruin its Credit at Market, and that
in effect, is to ruin your Trade.</P>
<P>'TIS a Mistake to say, the <HI>French</HI> and
<HI>Dutch</HI> rival your Manufacture; they may
rival them indeed in Price, in endeavouring
to undersel you; but no Nation in the World
can come up to you in Goodness, or match
the intrinsick Value of the Goods; and what
does all their rivalling and imitating your
Manufacture amount to? If they cannot equal
it in Goodness, equalling it in Price amounts
to nothing; a Diamond may be cheap, and
a Cart-Load of old Iron may be dear:
The <HI>English</HI> Manufacture is always good, its
<PB N="146" REF="158"/>
never dear, because the Price is proportioned
to the Goodness, and is more than as much
better than the <HI>French,</HI> as it is in Price high∣er;
and that is so much more than equivalent
in the Market.</P>
<P>THIS as it respects foreign Trade, is in∣deed
foreign to our Purpose, and therefore, I
pray, it may be taken for a Digression, or
read it in Parenthesis, and so you may read
it, or pass it over as you please, the other
Work will read without it.</P>
<P>BUT I bring it back to our Inland Com∣merce
thus; The Cheapness or Dearness of
that Part of our publick Stock, which is con∣sumed
at Home, is not of one Farthing Va∣lue
in our Trade, because it is not of any
Weight, one Way or other in the publick
Stock. It is begun among our selves, paid
for by our selves, and to our selves, and so is
neither here or there, 'tis the same Thing;
and tho' all the Hands it passes thro', raise a
Gain from it, and it goes on saddled with
their Expence, yet the last Consumer pays it
all; he loses whatever others gain, and so
you are but just where you was; 'tis a Dance
truly in a Circle, and you end just where
you began, the People live by one another,
and then live upon one another.</P>
<P>THUS the Plowman raises the Corn, which
pays his Landlord his Rent; the Poor buy the
Corn for Bread for their Families, which Corn
they pay for to the Countryman in Money;
<PB N="147" REF="159"/>
this enables him to pay his Landlord the Rent.
The Manufacturer employs the Poor, and
gives them a good Price for their Labour,
by which they are enabled to pay the Far∣mers,
or the Bakers under them for their
Corn, that is, for their Bread; and again the
Tradesman employs the Manufacturer, and
pays him in Money, enabling him to em∣ploy
the Poor, the Spinner, Weaver, <HI>&amp;C.</HI>
and thus the Money circulates with the Trade.</P>
<P>IF this Tradesman grinds down the Manu∣facturer,
and abates his Price, as has been
hinted, the Abatement circulates through the
whole Trade, and influences every Branch,
even to the Landlord's Rent, as above; and
what Advantage is this to the Nation's Com∣merce?
Not one Farthing in fact. Nor in∣deed
does even the Consumer, that is, the last
Buyer, or Wearer, ordinarily feel any Ad∣vantage
by it: 'Tis all sunk in the Pocket of
the said over-grown Tradesman, who by this
means, becomes an Oppressor of his Fellow-Tradesmen,
and is injurious to his Country,
and to the Commerce in general.</P>
<P>`Tis, therefore, no improper Maxim, to
lay down in a Discourse of this Nature, that
a Tradesman grown over-great and over-rich,
is no Advantage to Trade in general. I have
read of a Law, which was in force in a cer∣tain
Island in the <HI>Levant,</HI> call'd <HI>Zia,</HI> that
whoever was so unjust to his Country, as
to live above sixty Years, should be poisoned;
<PB N="148" REF="160"/>
that the rest of the People might not be in
Danger of being starv'd.</P>
<P>THIS was indeed a little barbarous; but
it would be much more rational in Commerce,
to make a Law, that after a Tradesman should
arrive to be worth above such a certain Sum,
suppose it should be thirty, to forty, to fifty,
or to sixty thousand Pounds, place it where
you will, he should then be obliged to leave
off Trade, and have no more to do with
Commerce; I mean Shop-Keeping or Ware∣house-Keeping
Commerce; but should be
obliged to leave it to other Tradesmen, that
he might not starve the poor young Trades∣men,
that set up by him, by engrossing the
Business, and underselling.</P>
<P>NOT that such a Law can be expected in
this Land of Liberty, but every Body will
claim to Trade, as long as they please, and
for as much as they please, and as cheap as
they please. But it must be said too, that it
is no less a Grievance in Trade for all that.</P>
<P>ALL regrating and forestalling of Markets,
is accounted so pernicious in Trade, that there
are Laws against it, as there is against Com∣binations
and Engrossings also; in short, a
Man thus over-grown in Trade and Wealth,
is an Engrosser and Forestaller of Course,
he is also a Combination in himself. How
often have we seen one over-rich Tradesman
attempt at an <HI>India</HI> Sale, to buy all the Cof∣fee,
another all the Pepper, and so of other
<PB N="149" REF="161"/>
Goods, and then put their own Price upon
those Goods for a while, and so impose upon
the whole Nation.</P>
<P>WE have had several Examples of this
kind in Trade here in <HI>London,</HI> but general∣ly
without Success; Sir <HI>Thomas Cooke</HI> of
<HI>Hackney,</HI> bought up once all the long Cloths
at an <HI>East-India</HI> Sale, amounting to 80000 <HI>l.</HI>
Sterling, and having the Command of a great
Shop of Cash, as I might call it, near <HI>Lom∣bard-Street,</HI>
clear'd and paid for them all in
Time. We have seen the same done lately in
other Goods, as the Cochineal by one, and
the Pepper by another: But as these Engros∣sings
did not usually succeed, so indeed, nei∣ther
is it the Advantage of Trade that it
should be so; and such over-grown Trades∣men
are a Nusance in Trade.</P>
<P>AS I said, that Trade ought to circulate
through as many Hands as possible, so it is
not for the Advantage of the Trade in gene∣ral,
to be managed by a few Tradesmen.</P>
<P>IN the first Place, it is more in the Power
of those few to make Combinations in Trade,
then it is when the Tradesmen are multiply'd
to a greater Number; two or three great rich
Tradesmen are able to join together, and to
buy up any Quantity of Goods; whereas if
the Trade was in the Hands of a great Num∣ber,
they would never be brought into it,
or would never agree when they were in.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="162"/>
IT is certainly better, that fifty Trades∣men
were carrying on a particular Trade,
with every Man a 1000 <HI>l.</HI> Stock, than one
great over-grown Tradesman, with 50000 <HI>l.</HI>
Stock; for besides that by so much Trade
being engrossed in one Hand, as would main∣tain
fifty Families, 'tis also in the Power of
that one Tradesman to oppress, and perhaps
injure an hundred more, and in the End, ruin
several of them: This is too evident in ma∣ny
Particulars. In a Word, an over-grown
Tradesman is a publick Grievance in Trade.</P>
<Q><P>1. AS by his flowing Stock, he has the
Opportunity of watching Advantages;
and buying only of the poorest Dealers,
and when they, wanting Money, are obli∣ged
to sell, tho' to Loss, rather than not
raise immediate Cash to keep the Wheel
of their Trade a-going; like those saving
House-Keepers that go to Market at
eleven a-Clock at Night, when they
know the Butchers (willing to be gone)
will rather sell a Joint of Meat for less
than it cost them, than turn away a Cus∣tomer.
This is an Oppression upon
Trade, and is an Advantage meerly
owing to the Stock they have above
their Neighbours.</P>
<P>2. BY the vast Stock they have in Trade,
they give large Credit where they think
the Tradesmen they deal with are safe,
<PB N="151" REF="163"/>
and by keeping such Men always in
their Books, they secure the Customer,
and make him pay a better Price than
otherwise he would do; so making
themselves whole that Way for what
they sell at Under-Rates at other Times,
and to other Men.</P>
<P>3. WHERE they are rivall'd by any other
Tradesmen, they immediately sell their
Goods at Underprizes, to get and secure
the Trade from that Rival; and this
they will do, so long, till they shall tire
the other out, and cause them to give
it over. Thus I have seen a Brewer
in a Country. Town, when another has
set up near him, sell all his Beer Two
or Three Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel cheaper,
on purpose to break the new Comer,
and carry it on, till he has brew'd him∣self
a thousand Pound out of Pocket,
and when the other, being overcome,
and perhaps almost broke, has given it
over, then he has rais'd his Price Four
or Five Shillings <HI>per</HI> Barrel, till he has
made himself whole again, and then go
on upon a Level as before.</P>
<P>4. UPON all Occasions these Men stand
ready to buy (as the Tradesmen call
it) the good Bargains, to get all the
Pennyworths, which other Tradesmen
cannot do for want of Money. In a
word, these are the Men that can buy
<PB N="152" REF="164"/>
cheap and sell dear, and that have infi∣nite
Advantages over their Neighbours;
and for that very Reason they are, as
I call it, a Burden and a Nusance to
Trade, an Injury to young Begin∣ners,
the Ruin of the Poor, and a general
Calamity to the whole Nation; I mean
in its trading Capacity only, for other∣wise
to have Men be Masters of large
Stocks gain'd in Trade, is an Encou∣ragement
to Trade it self, and a Benefit
to the Publick.</P></Q>
<P>I shall conclude this Part by directing
the thriving rich or over-rich Tradesman
to act the generous Part; to charge it upon
himself, to continue, what 'tis supposed
he had been in his Beginning, namely, a
fair Trader; not to take unjust and ruinous
Advantages in Trade; not to turn Devourer
in Business, cruel and voracious to his Neigh∣bour;
crushing the poor Country Manufac∣turer
or Wholesale Dealer by either unfair
Buying or Underselling.</P>
<P>LET him not grind the poor Manufactu∣rer,
by forcing them to sell cheaper than
'tis apparent he can work: He should
remember that the Man will but go home
and get it out of the labouring Poor,
and so, as I said above, drive them to
the Jail, or to the Parish, or perhaps to
<PB N="153" REF="165"/>
both; the Man to the first, and his Wife
and Children to the last.</P>
<P>HE should remember that by thus buying
cheaper than the Maker can sell, he not only
makes the Manufacturer oppress and crush
the Poor, and so, as has been said, scatter
and disperse them, lessen the Consumption
of the Produce, and so cause both Labour
and Land to sink together; but he oppresses
the Trade itself, wrongs the Credit of the
Goods, and brings them down as Market;
because the Maker being impos'd upon in the
Abatement of Price, by the Consequence
abates in the Goodness of his Goods, and
brings them worse to Market than ever he
did before.</P>
<P>THE Nature of the Thing implies it: If
the Price is abated, the Workmanship will
abate; the Spinners, Weavers, and Cloth∣workers
all are affected, and all will agree in
this Method, that if you will not give the
usual Price, you cannot expect the Goods
to be of the usual Goodness.</P>
<P>AND what's the Consequence of all this,
but that in the End the Trade is ruin'd, the
Manufacture spoil'd, the Tradesmen are
broke, the Poor remov'd, and the Manufac∣ture,
in a word, is given over? 'Tis not
known again by its own Face, or call'd by
its own Name; the very Names of the
Goods are lost in the World: New Manu∣factures
are invented, and so the Trade goes
<PB N="154" REF="166"/>
round in a Circle; the Rich devour the
Poor, the Poor starve the Manfacture,
and the Badness of the Manufacture ruins
the Trade; and this is the Reason why such
flourishing Tradesmen every Day break,
and are undone, namely, that vying with one
another in this Manner of Trade, and sink∣ing
their Goods, they fall together, ruin
themselves and the Trade too.</P>
<P>SUCH Tradesmen as these should leave
off; 'tis Time they should leave Room for
those that come after them: To see a Trades∣man
worth forty or fifty thousand Pound,
and yet trading sill, plodding still, I look
upon him like a great Dragon in a Wood,
that devours all the Travellers, till some
great Accident happens, that disarms him,
and puts an End to him, and to the Spoil he
does, all at once.</P>
<P>ENGROSSING Trade is in itself as much
an Evil as engrossing any particular Goods
in Trade; it is a Combination which is al∣ways
esteem'd a Grievance; that Man is a
Fund of Commerce in himself, and he has
held it so long, that he is a meer Combi∣nation
in himself, though he has no Corre∣spondence
in it with others: As he himself
confederates with himself, he buys up all
the large Parcels of Goods, which are too
great for other Tradesmen in his own Way
to buy, then sells them all out among those
Tradesmen, but with an Advance to him∣self;
<PB N="155" REF="167"/>
so that he as effectually secures them
from selling under such or such a Price, as
if they had combin'd together positively not
to do it, and none but himself can under∣sell;
for at the same Time he can sell as
cheap as he will; he can sell as low as
they bought, that is to say, he can sell as
cheap to another Chapman as he did to those
of his own Trade.</P>
<P>THUS he is a Bite upon the Men of his
own Trade; for they are bound, and he is
loose; they are bound by their Interest not
to sell cheaper than they bought, and he at
the same Time is free to sell as low as he
did to them, by which Means they can sell
none while he has any left.</P>
<P>WHAT scandalous doing is this? 'tis
a Tyranny in Trade; the over-grown
Tradesman is, in short, a trading Tyrant,
and he tyrannizes in a most unjust and
unreasonable Manner over all the Trades∣men
of his own Class; nay, he tyrannizes
over Trade itself; for while it is the true
Interest of Trade to be extended, and dilated
in such a Manner, that as many Families,
and as many People as possible, may be em∣ploy'd
in, and maintain'd by it; he, on
the contrary, contracts it, crowds it into a
narrow Compass, manages as much in his
own little Circle, and perhaps with four or
five Servants, as would and might, and in∣deed
ought to employ and maintain twenty
<PB N="156" REF="168"/>
Families of Head-Tradesmen, such as him∣self,
or at least such as himself was when
he begun, and their Servants, suppose two
Servants to each Shop.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he is a Tyrant, and an Oppres∣for
to those very Servants who he keeps;
for suppose, for Example, he keeps at a
Time five Apprentices; when these Ap∣prentices
come out of their Times, he
starves them; he prevents them; they may
easily see 'tis to no Purpose to set up near
him; there's no body can live within his
Compass; like a high, old, overspreading
Tree, it ought to be cut down, or at least
the Branches be loppp'd off; for nothing
will grow under it; what with keeping the
Beams of the Sun off, and what with drop∣ping
continually in wet Weather, and shed∣ding
a whole Surface of Leaves at another
Season, its Greatness and Breadth makes the
very Soil barren about it; nothing can
thrive under its Shade.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman thus over-grown with
Stock, and pushing on his Trade with a power∣ful
Cash, is a destructive Shade to all the
young Tradesmen that set up near him;
so that he breeds up Apprentices, in short,
to nothing; he takes their Money, indeed,
and has the Benefit of their seven Years
Services, and when they come out of their
Times, they are just where they were; they
can do nothing for themselves, unless they
<PB N="157" REF="169"/>
go out of his Reach, out of his Knowledge;
and as that is to go out of their own Know∣ledge
too, so all the Acquaintance they
have made in the Time of their Service is of
no Use to them.</P>
<P>NOR does it end here; but perhaps in
the Town they go to, there's such another
trading Tyrant, and so on in a third Place;
and what if there were one in every conside∣rable
trading Town? as to speak the Truth,
there are few without; what then? what
must young Tradesmen do? The Answer is
best given by pleading the Fact; what do
they do? 'Tis plain: They do set up, and
labour in the Fire; some few struggle hard,
and by Dint of Industry and Stock, make
Shist to hold it till kind Death, or some other
Accident, removes the Tyrant Tradesman,
and then the Stream of Trade that was
damm'd up, breaks out, and every one gets
some, as in a great Drought, a hasty Rain
making a Flood, the low Lands drink in their
Fill, and then the rest are refresh'd.</P>
<P>BUT in the mean Time, how many poor
young Tradestmen are crush'd, and not being
able to live under the Droppings of this great
Tree, languish a while, starve and die away?
I mean, die as Tradesmen? that is to say,
fail and break, or waste what Stock they had,
and are obliged to give over, for Fear of it?
In which last Case, they always come off
with Wounds and Scars, Losses, and lessen∣ing
<PB N="158" REF="170"/>
of their Fortunes; and this makes so
many young Tradesmen go abroad; pushing
some into one Business, some into another,
to raise their Fortunes, and some into the
Armies.</P>
<P>BUT it must be added too, that this is a
Calamity in Trade, and abundantly proves
that it is injurious; that to have too much
Trade engross'd into one Hand, is taking the
Bread from the Mouths of many others that
have a Right to be fed with it, and is an Ex∣orbitance
which, if it were possible, ought to
be prevented. Trade should be a current
Channel, and ought to flow for the Benefit
of the whole Body: Industry claims an
Encouragement; and though a great and rich
Tradesman cannot be legally limited and re∣strain'd
from continuing in Trade, as long
as he pleases; yet such a Man may be told,
that he should not make himself an Oppres∣for
in Trade; that he should not be an un∣fair
Trader at his latter End, that was not
so in his Beginning; that he should have a
just Regard to the Trade it self, as well as to
his private and particular Profit; not to run
down the Price of Goods, or the Labour of
the Poor, only because he can gain when
others cannot.</P>
<P>In a word, he may be told, that he is
a common Grievance to the Trade in gene∣ral,
and to his Country, when he does so;
and that he ceases to be a Compleat Trades∣man,
<PB N="159" REF="171"/>
when he turns Engrosser and Under∣miner
of his Neighbours. The Compleat
Tradesman is a generous Tradesman, and
will not be an unfair Trader, will not act
to the Prejudice, either of his Trading
Neighbours, or of the Trade it self: Where
such are, and how hard they are to be found,
is a Subject to be spoken of by it self.</P>

and to whom it is his Interest to bring their
Husbands into Part of his Business; and so
he may divide it into several Parts.</P>
<P>PART of his Substance may be abroad in
foreign Adventures, and he may think it pro∣per
to wait till it comes safe in; for a Trades∣man
is not a Compleat Tradesman till he has
got all his Effects Home, every Bottom
wound up, and his Estate lodg'd, either in
the Bank, or in some establish'd Fund, where
he is sure to enjoy its Revenue, without Ha∣zard
or Defalkation of any kind.</P>
<P>IN this Case, and supposing all safe, we
must talk of him in a different Position: 'Tis
certain, leaving off his Business with twenty
thousand Pounds in his Pocket, he changes
his Situation in the World, that is to say,
<PB N="161" REF="173"/>
he lays down the Tradesman, and takes up
the Gentleman with a thousand Pounds a
Year Estate.</P>
<P>AS he begins his new Figure in such an
advanc'd Station, let me give seasnable
Hint to him; and then as he has done with
Trade, so I shall have done with him; for
I am not writing to the Gentleman, but
the Tradesman.</P>
<Q><P>1. AS he has been bred up a Tradesman,
he will not be to seek in what Part of
Life to begin; a managing Gentleman
is certainly the safest in his Circumstan∣ces;
the one main Thing he has to do
as a Gentleman, is only to live within
the Compass of his Income, within the
Limits of his Estate.</P>
<P>HE that has a thousand Pounds a Year Estate
ought to spend five hundred a Year, and
no more: He that once comes to lay
up five hundred Pounds a Year, out of
his Eftate, will always see a rising Fa∣mily
under him; as he that spends
but one hundred Pounds a Year more
than his Estate brings in, will always
be necessitous, under the Hatches,
must borrow, mortgage, or sell, and
so gradually bleeds to Death.</P></Q>
<P>LET the managing Tradesman be but a
managing Gentleman too, and he is made for
<PB N="162" REF="174"/>
Ages, his Family is established; every two
Years he can add fifty Pounds a Year in
Land to his Estate; and if he lives twenty
Years in such a Circumstance, adding the
additional Income, and the Advances made
by it, he leaves his Estate doubled, and
grown up to two thousand Pounds a Year.</P>
<P>THE great Misfortune of this luxurious
Age is, that the Gentlemen of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI>
cannot do thus; that they must, and do,
and will live, as the <HI>Scots</HI> calls it, in the
middle of their Geer, that is, to the Extent
of their Revenue; and this is the Reason,
that they not only cannot increase, but will
always decline, unless they please to take up,
and live within the Compass of their Estates.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Truth, that the Luxu∣ry
of the Gentry is the Prosperity of the
Tradesman; the high and expensive Way
of Living, which the Gentry of this Nation
are, of late fallen into, is a too certain Foun∣dation
of the Increase of Commerce, and of
the Ruin of the Gentry both together; it is
true, frequent War, a flourishing Court, and
the Increase of publick Business, is a Door
at which Preferment enters, by which the
Posterity of the present declined Fami∣lies
may rise again, and the young beggar'd
Gentry may pick up a little; but suppose
that, what a Decimation do they first suffer?
how few are those that rise to those that fall?
and how poor are the ordinary Heights they
<PB N="163" REF="175"/>
rise to, compar'd to what their luxuriant An∣cestors
fell from?</P>
<P>LET the miserable List of Half-Pay Men,
the Skeletons of the late War, testify this: What
are they look'd upon to be at this Time? Are
they not the Nation's Pensioners, spending the
Remains of their Days as their Parents did?
The Remains of their Fortune is a kind of
Indolence, that themselves are asham'd of,
like an old Weapon growing rusty for want
of Use, till by meer Time, they grow In∣valids
to their Country, as they have been
all along to themselves; and if a War does
not intervene to restore them to Action, they
die off, only to relieve their Country, and
ease the Publick of the Charge of them.</P>
<P>BUT I return to the exalted Tradesman:
He knows the World too well, not to know,
that not to live within the Compass of his Es∣tate,
is to condemn himself to a declining Con∣dition
from the first Hour; and who would
think, that obliging himself to live within
the Compass of five, or six, or seven hun∣dred
a Year Expence, can be called a Con∣finement?</P>
<P>HE
that has been a frugal managing Man
in Trade, can never, with his Senses about
him, turn an unthinking ftupid Extravagant
when he leaves off: 'Tis contrary to the very
Nature of the Thing; 'tis contrary to the or∣dinary
Course of his Life; he must lay aside
all his Experience, his Understanding in Bu∣siness,
<PB N="164" REF="176"/>
and Knowledge of the World; for
there is something so absurd in a Life of
imprudent Expence, that a Man bred in Bu∣siness
can never fall into it, unless he has
first forfeited all his former Capacities, and
is no more able to make any Judgment of
Things.</P>
<P>IT is not possible he should not see the
spending more than his Income must end in
Ruin, must reduce that Income, and oblige
him at last to lessen the Expence double to
the first Extravagance: 'Tis very seldom that
Tradesmen, who have labour'd for the getting
an Estate, are themselves the Destroyers of
it; they know too well how to cast up Profit
and Loss, and 'tis too natural to them to look
into Things, to let them run on to Extremi∣ties.</P>
<P>HENCE,
I think there is the less Need to
talk to the Tradesman after he has laid down,
and is listed among the Gentry, than before.
I therefore return to him, as yet a Tradesman,
tho' rich, and when in the Height of his
trading Fortunes; for just then when he be∣gins
to cool in his trading Warmth, and enter∣tains
Thoughts of laying down and leaving
off, but has not yet done it, I say, then is an∣other
Crisis of the Tradesman's Fortunes, a
Juncture when he is in Danger of a Blow,
much more than he was in the full Course
of his Trade, or perhaps may ever be after
it.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="177"/>
1. THEN he is in the greatest Danger of
Projects, and that with this particular Mis∣chief,
that if he adventures upon any Thing,
'tis generally something large, great, propor∣tion'd
to the Figure he made in Business be∣fore,
that is to say, it will be as equal in Danger
to his Capacity of bearing, as lesser Projects
are to lesser People; and indeed the Diffe∣rence
between them lies here only, <HI>namely,</HI>
that a little Tradesman is ruined by little Pro∣jects,
a capital over-grown Tradesman by
larger Undertakings; with this Disadvan∣tage
still to the latter, <HI>viz.</HI> that if his great
Undertakings miscarry, the Blow is gene∣rally
irrecoverable, and the Wound incu∣rable.</P>
<P>LESSER
Hurts may be healed; but these
are mortal Wounds, or no Wounds at all.
I could name some of the vast Undertakings
which deep Heads have run into, which
have been too great for any single Hands to
manage, too heavy for any single Backs to
bear; such was farming the Revenues of
<HI>Ireland,</HI> by Alderman <HI>Forth,</HI> engrossing
the Long Cloth and Sallampores by Sir
<HI>Thomas Cook;</HI> building whole Streets, or
Towns rather, besides <HI>Osterly-House,</HI> by
Doctor <HI>Barebone;</HI> planting Colonies in <HI>New
Jersey, Pensilvania,</HI> and <HI>Carolina,</HI> and ma∣ny
others; all which mortally wounded the
Fortunes and Credit of the Undertakers of
them, even after they were worth not
<PB N="166" REF="178"/>
20000 <HI>l.</HI> only, but some of them three or four
Times those Sums.</P>
<P>I know nothing in which a rich <HI>Leaving∣off</HI>
Tradesmen has more need of Advice,
than just at the Time of advancing into
some Capital Undertaking, that has a fair
Prospect, but a remote and vastly extended
View; which if it takes, will indeed do great
Things, but if it miscarries, will undo great
Things also, and ruin him after he is already
made rich.</P>
<P>WHAT Temptation but that I mentioned
before, of meer Avarice, can lie in the Way
of a Man worth 20000 <HI>l.</HI> in his Pocket?
what can he propose to himself, better than
what he already has? If it be to get an Es∣tate,
he is answered, he has an Estate. As
I said before, he has a thousand a Year in
Hand, and a moral Certainty of a thousand
a Year more, with a Negative only.</P>
<P>IT is a very remarkable Difference which
attends the Tradesman I am speaking to,
in the Consequence of this Management; his
Prosperity consisted before all in the active
Part of Life; in Diligence, Application,
Endeavour, and turning his Head and Hand
to every profitable Thing in the Road and
Course of his Business; and I have said
enough to spur the young Tradesman on to
Diligence, on Purpose to bring him to this
Circumstance of Life, which I call rich.</P>
<P><PB N="167" REF="179"/>
BUT now being to wind off the Bottom,
being grown rich, and resolv'd to leave off,
as he is going to change the Figure of his
Life, and place himself in a quite differing
Posture in Life, so the Direction is quite dif∣ferent
also, for now his only Virtue is Indo∣lence,
the only safe Part he is to act (if it be
proper to call it acting) is, <HI>I say,</HI> to do no∣thing,
and I must add, it is the most difficult
Part too.</P>
<P>IT is not difficult only, but next to im∣possible
to a Tradesman, bred to Business,
bred to be always looking sharp out, watch∣ing
Advantages, and then taking hold of
them, improving every Hint, pushing every
visible Advantage; 'tis next to impossible,
for such a Man to sit still, and do nothing;
to see the World flow up to his very Teeth,
and not open his Mouth to take it in; 'tis
against the very Current of his Blood;
he cannot do it; Nature, Reason, and every
Thing about him, at least by their Outsides,
call upon him to come in, and be made at
once. But a good Judgment, and the Event
of Things foreseen at a Distance, would with∣hold
him; there his Reason would sound
a Negative to him, and bid him stand, <HI>fast.
Come in and be made:</HI> Why I am made, <HI>says
he;</HI> I dont want it. <HI>Come in and be rich,</HI>
Avarice says: I am rich; and can, with Pa∣tience,
be as much richer as I please.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="180"/>
HOW many over-grown rich Tradesmen,
leaving off, nay, who had left off Trade,
and retir'd to enjoy what they had got,
came at this unhappy Summons of their
Avarice, into the late publick Infatuation,
ruin'd at one Blow the Fruits of forty Years
unwearied Diligence and Labour, and
went out and hang'd themselves.</P>
<P>AND yet who could withstand the At∣tack;
the very Principle of a Tradesman
fell in with it: There was no room to resist
it; Nature hardly furnish'd them with one
Word to say against closing with it: 'Twas
the hardest Thing in the World to reconcile
the Negative to common Sense; and yet
none but those who adher'd to the Nega∣tive,
even against common Sense, were safe;
unless they got safe out after they were
plung'd deep in, which was next to impos∣sible.</P>
<P>BUT
to leave exclaiming at particular
Examples, the Advice is general, and will
hold good in all its several Parts: The rich
Tradesman once left off, having converted
his Money into solid Rents, laid the Trades∣man
down, and commenc'd Gentleman, as
above, he ought the first Thing he does to
put a resolved Negative upon all Proposals
of Business whatsoever: He has one esta∣blish'd
Business before him, and in that he
is effectually safe, has no Risque to run, no
Dangers in View; 'twill make him rich with∣out
<PB N="169" REF="181"/>
Possiblity of Miscarriage, and that is,
live upon one Half of his Income, and lay
up the other Half: Such a Man is out of
the Reach of Fortune or Misfortune; no
Casualty can reach him; 'tis impossible he
can be hurt.</P>
<P>IF he leaves off, as I have said, at 20000 <HI>l.</HI>
in his Pocket, that is, at 1000 <HI>l.</HI> a Year
Estate, how easily will he raise his Revenue
to 2000 <HI>l.?</HI> and how easily may his Suc∣cessor,
pursuing that Method, advance it
to almost what Magnitude he pleases?</P>
<P>PRUDENT Management, and frugal Living,
will increase any Fortune to any Degree:
I knew a private Gentleman, whose Father
set him up thus, worth 20000<HI>l.</HI> and bid
him go and set up for a Gentleman, for he
would not let him meddle with Trade. The
Father had gotten a great Estate by Mer∣chandize;
but told his Son 20000<HI>l.</HI> was a
very good Trade, and if he manag'd it well,
he would be rich without running the Risques
of a Merchant.</P>
<P>THE young Gentleman took the Hint,
and begun the World with a good Estate,
liv'd frugally, yet handsomely; purchas'd an
Estate of 1500<HI>l. per Annum</HI> with his own
Stock and his Wife's Fortune, which was
very considerable.</P>
<P>IN this Manner he went on for some
Years, till his Family increas'd: He spent
about 300<HI>l. per Annum,</HI> then 400<HI>l.</HI> and
<PB N="170" REF="182"/>
at length 500<HI>l.</HI> Before he came to spend 400<HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> he had raised his Estate to 1800<HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> by the mere Increase of its
own Income; always putting the Money out
as fast as it came in, upon the publick Se∣curities,
which at that Time paid 7 <HI>l. per
Cent.</HI> Interest. At the End of fifteen Years
he had raised his Estate to 2500<HI>l.</HI> a Year,
the Subscription or Engraftment, as it was then
called, to the <HI>Bank,</HI> falling in at that Time:
When his Estate was thus large, he took a
larger House into his Hands, being of his
own Estate too; and setting up a Coach,
his Expences amounted to near 800<HI>l.</HI> a
Year, not more; and at that Time his old
Father died, and left him a vast Addition
to his Fortune, being no less than between
50 and 60000<HI>l.</HI> in Money and Rents; so
that when it was all put together, he had a
clear Estate of between 5 and 6000<HI>l.</HI> a
Year.</P>
<P>AS he liv'd in a handsome Figure before,
so he did not at all enlarge his Equipage
on this Occasion; but his Family growing
numerous, and also growing up, obliged him
to an Expence of about 1000 to 1200 <HI>l.
per Annum,</HI> never more.</P>
<P>THIS Man lived twenty two Years after
his Father's last Lump was left him; and
going on upon the same prudential Improve∣ment
as above, it was found at his Death,
that he had 16000<HI>l. per Annum</HI> stated Re∣venue,
<PB N="171" REF="183"/>
and almost 90000<HI>l.</HI> in Ready Mo∣ney,
that is to say, in the <HI>Bank, Exchequer,</HI>
and such other publick Securities, as were to
be esteemed Ready Money.</P>
<P>ONCE I saw a Caculation made from his
Estate in his own Presence; for I had so
far an Intimacy with his Affairs, by which
it appear'd, that in twenty five Years more,
had he liv'd so long, he must have been
worth two Millions Sterling.</P>
<P>'TIS true this was raised from a capital
Beginning; but 'tis as true, that every Be∣ginning,
where the Expence is within the
Compass of the Income, will do the same
Thing in Proportion, and that without any
Risque of miscarrying. Indeed (human Vi∣ciffitudes
allow'd for) a Man that lives thus
within the Limits of his Revenue, cannot
miscarry; there's no Room for Disaster, no
Possibility of Miscarriage.</P>
<P>He does not increase by Art and by Craft,
not by Management of Stock, or making
Gain of this or that particular Thing; he
increases by Nature, by the mere Consequence
of Things; if fix comes in, and four goes out,
there must be two left behind; nothing can
break in upon the Security of this Man's
Affairs, but some publick Calamity, such
a War, as should expose us to publick Inva∣sions
and Depredations of an Enemy, to ra∣vage
the Land, and burn down the Tenants
Houses; and even in such a Case they could
<PB N="172" REF="184"/>
not carry away the Land; the Fee-Simple,
with After-Years of Peace would restore all
again.</P>
<P>WHY then should the Tradesman look
any where but right before him? If he is
withdrawn from Trade, let him fix his Staff
down there, and never turn to the Right
Hand, or to the Left; he has an Estate and
an Establishment for his Life, by that he
stands, and keeping to that he can never fall;
let him resolve to give the Negative to eve∣ry
Proposal, to every Offer, however ad∣vantageous;
and till he can do that, he is
never safe.</P>
<P>FROM the first Hour that he withdraws
out of Trade, he should resolve to with∣draw
wholly out of it, and then he may
write <HI>Secure</HI> upon his Door, and not till then,
because Trade is never without its Hazards;
an Estate as an Estate, is in no Danger, but
from the Kitchen and the Stable. Nothing
wounds the Estate, but the Table and the
Equipage, if the Expence is kept under the
Revenue, the Man will always grow, and
be always growing; if not, I need not say,
what will follow: Causes and Consequences
are always steady and the same, and will
ever be so to the End of Time.</P>
<P>THERE are also many Disasters in Trade,
which sometimes bear hard upon, even the
most Capital Tradesmen, and that so hard, as
to hazard their Ruin, even in the Highest of
<PB N="173" REF="185"/>
their Fortunes: The sudden rising and fal∣ling
of any one particular Article in Trade,
how has it sunk a particular Tradesman, four
to five thousand Pounds at a Time? This I
have known frequently happen, and that in
several particular Sorts of Goods; and this
dips deep into a Tradesman's Stock, tho' he
should be so overgrown, as we have now
described: The sudden Surprize of Fires, as
such Disasters are sometimes circumstanced,
and especially, before the late Insurances of
Goods in Warehouses have been set up. I
could name some so very considerable with∣in
these few Years, as had not such Insuran∣ces
been made, would have overthrown a
Man of 20000<HI>l.</HI> Stock; but 'tis not proper
to enter upon Particulars of such a Nature,
where the Examples are still in being and in
Business. 'Tis an ill Office to publish
Tradesmen Losses, 'tis what should be con∣ceal'd,
not reviv'd, especially while the
Men are living and trading.</P>
<P>BUT to go back beyond our present Age,
Sir <HI>William Warren</HI> was a famous Justice,
who by three, if not more Fires in <HI>Wap∣ping,</HI>
was so demolished, not only his Dwel∣ling
House, but whole Streets of Houses of
his own building, and rebuilding, burnt down,
that from a Man of a very great acquired
Fortune by Business, he was reduc'd to very
mean Circumstances, and yet had no other
<PB N="174" REF="186"/>
apparent Losses, at least none that were con∣siderable.</P>
<P>THE shutting up the Exchequer in King
<HI>Charles</HI> II's Time, how did it at once reduce
the Fortunes and Credit too of the chief
Bankers in <HI>Lombard-Street?</HI> eleven of them
were, as it evidently appear'd by the Accounts
afterwards given into Parliament, Men of
clear and great Estates, from 20000<HI>l.</HI> the least,
to immense Sums the highest; yet at one
Blow, they fell as if they had been blown
up with Gunpowder, or as the City of <HI>Pa∣lermo</HI>
lately fell by an Earthquake.</P>
<P>BUT to go no farther back than our own
Times; Will any Man say a Tradesman is
safe from Disaster? Let such look back upon
our late War, when not some Ships only, but
whole Fleets of Ships fell into the Hands of
the <HI>French,</HI> so that 3000 Sail were taken
before the Seas were any Thing like being
defended or duly guarded: Or to look on
our Affair of the <HI>South-Sea,</HI> or our Neigh∣bours
of the <HI>Missisipi,</HI> how many ruined
Families are to be seen in either Nation, and
among the Tradesmen only, who before that
Time were as much above the Fear of Dis∣aster,
as 20000<HI>l.</HI> can be supposed to make
any Man be.</P>
<P>LARGE Adventures are the Fate of large
Stocks in Trade; Men in the Height of Trade
do not, like young Beginners, venture a little
here and a little there; consequently, if Los∣ses
<PB N="175" REF="187"/>
come, they fall heavy. I have seen a
Tradesman in <HI>London</HI> give up his Books,
where he has appear'd to be worth 40000<HI>l.</HI>
clear of all Debts and Demands, and yet
sink and become Bankrupt in less than two
Years, and be, as we call it in Trade, half
as much worse than nothing.</P>
<P>IF this then is the Case, and the Trades∣man
is never safe while he is in Trade, he is
so long not out of the Reach, no, nor out
of the Want of good Advice; and the first
Advice I would give a rich Tradesman, be∣sides
what I have mentioned already, is, not
to run into great Adventures on the Presump∣tion
of his great Stock, or which is worse,
not on Presumption of his great Credit; not
to risque, because he can bear a Loss, but
as he grows rich let his Wariness and his Cau∣tions
increase, as his Stock increases.</P>
<P>IT is recorded of some Men famous in
Story for their Bravery and Courage, that
when they grew rich they grew Cowards,
and backward to run Hazards. The Story
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Merchant, who lifted under
<HI>Sertorius,</HI> whether Fact or a Fable, is very
applicable to this Case: He came a Stranger
into the Army, but was soon made remark∣able
to the whole Camp, and to the Gene∣ral
in particular, by his Gallantry, and by
his Courage on the most desperate and diffi∣cult
Occasions.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="188"/>
AT Length the General sent for him, and
desir'd to know him, and told him he had
been Witness to his Behaviour, and that he
was justly admir'd for his Courage and Bra∣very,
and enquired into his Circumstances:
He told the General, that he was a Merchant
of <HI>Italy:</HI> I suppose he told him of what
Place in particular; that travelling Home∣ward
out of <HI>Gaul,</HI> he fell among Thieves,
and was robb'd of all he had; by which be∣ing
utterly undone and reduc'd to Beggary
and Distress, he came into the Army for no
other End, but to die honourably, and so
put an End to a Life of Misery and Despe∣ration.</P>
<P>THE
General mov'd with Compassion, for
his Misfortunes, and pleas'd that he could
reward a Man of such Merit, gave him a
Commission, as we call it, that is, made him
a Centurion; his Behaviour still continuing
brave, he advanc'd him to the Command of
a Cohort, that is to say, made him a Colonel;
a Cohort generally consisting of from 800 to
1000 Men.</P>
<P>SOME Time after this, <HI>Sertorius</HI> having
some particular Pieces of Service, which re∣quired
an Officer of known Experience and
try'd Courage, he singled this Man out, and
gave him the Introduction to it, with a Com∣pliment
upon his Fidelity and Valour, which
he had seen try'd upon so many extraordi∣nary
Occasions. But was surprised to find
<PB N="177" REF="189"/>
that it was not received with the same Alacrity
and chearful Countenance as usual; but on
the contrary, with a kind of Reluctance
and Backwardness not usual in Men of Cou∣rage.</P>
<P>THIS
was so evident too, that the General
ask'd him the Occasion of it; and the Man
answer'd frankly, it was not that he was
weary of the Service, only that he thought
himself not so fit for it now, as before; but
if he could find out some Body <HI>that had
been robb'd lately,</HI> would certainly be
a fitter Man for it.</P>
<P>THE Moral of the Story is exactly to
my Purpose: Bold Adventures are for Men
of desperate Fortunes, not for Men whose
Fortunes are made; to make a Man rich and
great, adds nothing to his Vigour and Spirit
in the Business he is to undertake: Men
furnish'd for great Attempts, must be Men
who have great Expectations; when you
mount the Man, you dismount his Courage;
when he is upon the Pinacle of his For∣tunes,
he is past the Pinacle of his enter∣prising
Spirit; he has nothing to do then, but
to keep himself where he is.</P>
<P>NOW, though this is a Scoundrel Spirit
in a Hero, 'tis yet a noble Spirit in a Trades∣man:
'Tis a Meanness hardly honest in a
General; but 'tis a Wisdom and a Prudence
never enough to be commended in a Trades∣man:
Adventure sparingly if you would
<PB N="178" REF="190"/>
come out of Trade readily; the adventuring
Days are over, when the Tradesman sees
the Door open, and is looking for his Way
out of Trade.</P>
<P>HE that runs into great Adventures after
he has enrich'd himself; seems not to have
a true Notion of Trade; or to think it so
much a Lottery as he ought to know it is.
One would think common Prudence should
make a deeper Impression upon a Man of
twenty or thirty Years Experience in Trade,
than to leave him in any Want of Advice
as to such a Thing as this.</P>
<P>HE that has traded, as I say, twenty or
thirty Years, must have seen the Beginning
and End of many a fair Outside, must have
seen many a plausible Proposal vanish into
Smoke, and end in the same Emptiness
where it began: For him to dip in Air and
Vapour, and buy the Fancies of Projectors
and Undertakers with the solid Substance,
which he has laboured so many Years for,
it has something so preposterous in it, that
one would think no Man of ordinary Ex∣perience
could come into it; and yet nothing
is more frequent than to see such Men who
have been cunning enough for all the World
before, drop into the weakest Snares, and
be made Dupes of at last, by the meanest
and most Scoundrel Projector.</P>
<P>ON this Account, and because of the
many Examples there are to be given where
<PB N="179" REF="191"/>
such Men have miscarried: I say, on this
Account it is that I think this Advice is sea∣sonable;
and no Tradesman will think him∣self
affronted, if from the frequent Examples
of Men ruined by such Mistakes, I venture
to argue, that no Man is above the Caution,
no Man so secure as not to want it.</P>
<P>NOR do I confine myself in this Part, to
the Tradesman's being drawn into Projects
and great Undertakings, tho' these have been
the capital Mischiefs which have overthrown
so many, that I may well make it a Mark
of the whole.</P>
<P>BUT even in the Way of their own Busi∣ness,
how many rich Tradesmen have I seen
fall at last by over-large Adventures within
the Compass of their proper Business? How
many were ruined at the Beginning of the
first War, by undertaking to cloth the Ar∣my?
Others by the Transport Service:
Some by furnishing one Commodity, some
another; giving Credit to the Government,
under the Temptation of a great Price for
their Goods, and large Profits; at the same
Time being drawn in from one Article to
another, till they launched out not their
whole Stocks only, but to the utmost Ex∣tent
of their Credit; and the Government
not paying in Time, the rich Tradesman
has been ruined, with his Talleys in his
Hand, and with his Accounts to shew.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="192"/>
INNUMERABLE Instances of Tradesmen
ruined by these Things were to be seen in
those Days, till Want of the publick Cre∣dit
grew a terrible Calamity upon Trade;
and had not the Parliament restored that
Credit in the very critical Time, by making
good past Deficiencies, and shewing the Na∣tion
where their grand Securities lay; that
the Parliament only was the Fund of Funds,
which could alone give Credit, and sup∣port
it when given; by which the People
were encouraged to trust the Government,
without heavy Discounts and large Ad∣vancements
on the Rates of Goods sold to
them: I say, had not this been the Cafe,
the publick Credit must entirely have sunk,
and innumerable Tradesmen, even of the
first Magnitude, have fallen with it under the
general Calamity.</P>
<P>ALL this is mentioned, without any par∣ticular
Views in the Retrospect, to let us
see how frequent it has been, and conse∣quently
still may be, for the most Topping
Tradesmen, <HI>to use a Trading City Phrase,</HI>
to be overthrown, and sink under the or∣dinary
Calamities of Business; not with stand∣ing
their Circumstances have been otherwise
esteemed (even by themselves) to be above
the Reach of Disaster: From hence I may
reasonably argue, that the Tradesman has al∣ways
Occasion to be wary and cautious; and
even the higher he advances, he should be
<PB N="181" REF="193"/>
so far from abating, that he should increase
his Vigilance, by how much his Dangers
are greater from Adventures of greater Mag∣nitude.</P>
<P>PARTICULARLY
there seems to be a Danger
such Men are more than others expos'd to;
I mean that of giving over-large Credit.
This is sometimes unavoidable, but gene∣rally
speaking, should be guarded against as
one of the most dangerous Consequences of
a strong Stock, and a powerful Credit.
How often have we found in some of our
late Commissions of Bankrupt, that this or
that particular Man has come in a Creditor
to the Rate of ten, twelve, to fourteen
thousand Pounds a Man? All trusted, as
we say, upon the Honour of a particular
Tradesman, who in the End shews, that he
has no Honour, or perhaps Honesty at all;
and this without Bond or Security, upon the
ordinary Faith of a Book Debt, and with∣out
any previous Consideration, more than
the mere Credit of the Man.</P>
<P>IF it were only that such a Man cannot
reasonably run in Debt so great a Sum,
if his own Circumstances were good, yet
such a Credit does not seem to correspond
with the usual Prudence of a Tradesman;
unless the Person trusting him has such a
clear Stock of his own, as not to value the
Loss of ten thousand Pounds at a Time; and
how many of these are to be found?</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="194"/>
THIS is generally the Reason why, when
such a Tradesman sinks, he pulls down a
great many with him, as was hinted before;
as a great Tree, which falling among the
smaller Wood, crushes many smaller, and
otherwise promising Plants with its Fall:
A Tradesman in full Credit, but ill rooted, and
rotten at Bottom, is really a terrible Article
in the Commonwealth of Trade; for Men
live with him as the People dwell upon
<HI>London-Bridge,</HI> without Fear, because of
his long Standing.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">That as the Tradesman is never too high
to fall, so he is never too low to rise;
and no Condition is so low or so despica∣ble
in a Tradesman, but he may with
Diligence and Application recover it.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S it was the encouraging Saying
of a wise Man relating to the ge∣neral
Changes of Life, 'tis much
more justly applied to the Misfor∣tunes
of a Tradesman, <HI>Nil desperandum:</HI>
A diligent Tradesman ought never to de∣spair.
And truly, Diligence is so absolutely
<PB N="183" REF="195"/>
necessary to a Tradesman's Prosperity, that
without it he ought never to hope.</P>
<P>A MAN that will lie still, should never
hope to rise; he that will lie in a Ditch
and pray, may depend upon it he shall lie
in the Ditch and die. This has determin'd
Diligence to be absolutely necessary to De∣liverance,
as Legs are to Progression. Ap∣plication
may be justly called Nature's
Crutches; he that will not help himself,
shall never be help'd: Heaven is always
able; but Heaven always requires us to be
a Means to ourselves, and he seldom fails
concurring with those Means; nay, it is so
far Heaven is pleased to concur, that he
gives the very Honour of our Prosperity
to ourselves, as if we were the Causes of it.
<HI>The diligent Hand makes rich.</HI> We know
'tis the Hand of Heaven that makes rich;
but the Text gives it to the Hand of Dili∣gence,
as if it were to encourage the Man to
Application, and to beftir himself, heartily
promising him both the Advantage and the
Credit of it, both the Honour and the Reward.</P>
<P>I HAVE spoken to the Subject of Indus∣try
at large in the former Volume; but I
have not mentioned it as a Distress, and un∣der
the Weight of Discouragement, which
is what I now propose: A Tradesman sets
up, falls, and sinks under Misfortunes, and
is undone: If he is a Man of no Spirit, in∣dolent,
dead-hearted, and desponding, he
<PB N="184" REF="196"/>
is undone indeed, or, as we say, <HI>utterly un∣done;</HI>
he despairs, faints, and lies in the
<HI>Mint,</HI> skulks under privileg'd Places, and
there his Creditors not complying, he sinks,
and dies: I have seen too many do thus
merely for want of Spirit and Courage to
work through Disster.</P>
<P>BUT the vigorous restless Man of Dili∣gence
never lies still there; he struggles,
he strives with Creditors, to get free; if
that will not do, he gets abroad, turns him∣self
round in the World, nay, I might say,
turns the World round with his Applica∣tion:
If one Thing fails, he meets another;
if not in one Place, he seeks out another;
he never gives out. I have known a Trades∣man
rise and fall, and rise and fall six or se∣ven
Times, and never give it over till at
last he has conquer'd the World, and risen
to stand.</P>
<P>NOR should any Man upbraid a Trades∣man
for being unwearied in his Applica∣tion;
nothing but unwearied Diligence and
invincible Courage can work a Man into
Business, who is once toss'd out of it by the
Misfortunes of Trade: Trade is like a Rol∣ling
Sea, that sometimes one Wave washes
a Man over Board, the next returning
Surge washes him on Board again; as one
Breath of Wind puffs a Candle out, and
the next Puff blows it in again: A
Tradesman is never out of Hope to rise,
<PB N="185" REF="197"/>
till he is nail'd up in his Coffin, and six
Foot under Ground.</P>
<P>HE may be truly said to walk after he is
(civilly) dead; for he revives when the very
Name of him is, as it were, buried and
forgotten; if he is in this Part of the Globe,
or in another, 'tis all one; his Hand or
Head is always at Work, or perhaps both;
he rolls about the World like a Snowball,
always gathering more, always increasing,
till he comes to a Magnitude sufficient to
exist of himself, and then he boldly shews
himself in the same Orbit, in which he first
shin'd; for that is what he ever aims at.</P>
<P>BUT then 'tis observable of the poor bu∣stling
Creature, that whenever he thus rises
from his Disasters, 'tis with the additional
Circumstances of great Industry and Hones∣ty,
or with no Character or Reputation; for
the Restoration of his Fortune and Figure
by Fraud and Knavery, is not, in my cast∣ing
up the Account, any Recovery at all,
any more than if a Man should go to Sea,
and get a new Estate by Rapine and Pyra∣cy:
This I would call no rising in the World,
no restoring of Circumstances; but he that
returns from the Captivity of his Fortunes,
with an Addition of Integrity to that of
Wealth, he returns with an Advantage
that wipes out the Infamy of his former Mis∣carriage,
and he shines the brighter for the
dark Cloud that has so long cover'd him.

THUS I have known a Tradesman come
back from an Absence of twenty Years, a
long Banishment from his Shop, his Busi∣ness,
and his Family, and having met with
happier Turns abroad, has called his Cre∣ditors
together, and though discharged from
legal Demands, has thought himself obliged
to make equitable Satisfation of the Debt,
as much as if it had been hill owing in due
Form.</P>
<P>AND this Testimony of the Integrity of
a Tradesman's Principle, I must acknow∣ledge
stands upon Record against the com∣mon
Scandal mentioned in our third Chap∣ter,
namely, that a Tradesman cannot be
honest; that they are all Rogues; that they
not only are so, but must be so; that it is
so by the absolute Necessity of their Calling;
and that it cannot be otherwise. But by
this Gallantry of Principle in Trade, they
testify it was really at Bottom in all their
Actions, whatever the unhappy Exigences
of their Circumstances brought them to the
absolute Necessity of doing; for I must
always be allowed to say, that absolute
Necessity forces many a poor distressed
Tradesman to do Things, which he is
a Penitent for to the last Hour of his
Life, and which his very Soul abhorr'd in
the very doing.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="201"/>
BUT how glorious a Testimony is it to the
Fame and Character of the Man, when
through the many Difafters of a long un∣happy
Life, he returns loaden with Ho∣nesty,
and a good Conscience, and without
any evident Force, pays the Widows and
the Orphans, whose Families had fuffer'd
by him, and who had, as we may say, for∣gotten
the antient Injury, and retain'd no
Hopes of such a Free-will offering, how∣ever
due.</P>
<P>NOR must I forget (Charity commands
it) to take notice of the many mourning
Penitents, who have the same Honesty,
but are not blest with the same Opportunity
of making Reparation of Wrongs, and Re∣stitution
of Injuries done to others, whose
Grief it is, that they cannot do it, and who
sincerely wish for the Occasion: I cannot
doubt but there are many such in the
World, and have always been such; and
that righteous Heaven accepts the sincere
Resolution of such, for Peformance, though
they have not been bless'd with the Means
to perform it.</P>
<P>YET if I might be allow'd here to speak
a Word to the distreffed Tradesman in the
worst of his Circumstances, that savour'd
of any Thing serious, it should be to urge
him to maintain the Principle entire; as
the best Means, at least, to hope that he
shall have the Occasion put into his Hand,
<PB N="188" REF="202"/>
not by way of meritorious Honesty, but
upon this Dependance, That as Heaven
alone can support the Principle, so it may
be hoped he will one Time or other join
the Means and the End, and make them
able to do what they sinerely desire to do.</P>
<P>IT cannot be forgot, without Injustice to
the Case before me, That I know no Cir∣cumstance
of Life gives a Man a greater
Testimony to his Integrity than this of a
Tradesman; a Man in any other Capacity
seems to be entirely without so much as a
View or Prospect of it.</P>
<P>IN all other Disasters of Life, once un∣happy,
ever unfortunate; once branded
with Reproach, ever wearing that Mark of
Infamy: 'Tis the Tradesman's Felicity
only, that if he recovers his Disasters, 'tis
in his Breast too to recover his Character,
to restore himself to the Opinion of good
Men, and set himself right in their Esteem.</P>
<P>HOW many Gentlemen have I heard la∣ment
their Difafter in this Circumstance in
particular, that would sacrificed their Lives
to have recovered but the Name of an ho∣nest
Man, which perhaps for one early Slip,
leaves a BUT in their Character, like a Bend
in their Coat of Arms, to be remember'd as
long as their Names are to be heard of.</P>
<P>WHAT Examples might we not give in
History of this, particularly in two of the
greatest Men of their Days; the first of the
<PB N="189" REF="203"/>
good Lord <HI>Cranmer,</HI> Archbishop of <HI>Canter∣bury,</HI>
who to shew his Execration of that
one, and perhaps that only one ill Action
of his Life, with an inimitable Constancy
thrust his right Arm into the Fire, and held
it there to the last Gasp of Life, crying out,
<HI>Burn unworthy Right Hand,</HI> being the In∣strument
by which he denied his God, and
recanted his Religion.</P>
<P>THE other was the truly great Man, the Lord
<HI>Bacon,</HI> who being overcome by the Temp∣tation
of Avarice, fell once into the Crime of
Corruption in Justice, sunk under the Infa∣my
and Misery of it, and could never, by the
greatest Testimonies of Penitence, and of a
real Grief for the Fact, recover his Charac∣ter;
and the Weight of that particular Thing
broke his Heart.</P>
<P>I might give Instances nearer Home, and
in Cases some greater, some less, tho' none
more worthy our Mention. But to bring
it all to our Purpose: The Tradesman, how∣ever
miserable in his Fall, however scanda∣lous
in the Circumstance of it, however
great the Infamy, and with whatever Ag∣gravations
his Ruin has been, yet if once
he appears with a generous Honesty to dis∣charge
his old Obligations, and pay off the
Debts contracted in his Distress, he becomes
the Darling, even of Fame it self; he gains
an Applause, infinitely superior to all the
Reproach he suffer'd; he has ample Amends
<PB N="190" REF="204"/>
made him by the World, in a Manner, so
very much to his Advantage, that I know
no Case that comes up to it.</P>
<P>Nay, that which seems to requite the Man,
and make his very Memory Satisfaction for all
the unworthy Blasts it had before cast upon
his Reputation, and that not only in kind,
but with Interest, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is
ever paying the Debt, for it has never done
with it; the Man's Name is never men∣tioned,
but the Remembrance of this Pattern
of his Honesty is annex'd, as if it were an Ap∣pendix
to his History; 'tis a Debt due to
his Memory paid with Interest.</P>
<P>I cannot but say this is a particular En∣couragement
to a Tradesman to be honest,
because whenever he pleases to be so, all his
trading Miscarriages are forgotten, all his
false Steps are buried in that one Action of In∣tegrity,
and he is call'd an honest Man, nay,
the honestest of honest Men, ever after; with∣out
so much as one Reflection of Dishonour
upon the worst of his past Life: He is wash'd
clean from every Spot; he is clearer than an
Innocent, that never offended; for he is spo∣ken
of with such an Addition of Honour to
his Character, that a simple Life of Honesty,
though in the highest Degree seldom attains
to.</P>
<P>TO fall, is common to all Mankind; to
fall and rise, is a Particular that few Men
arrive to, and no Man so easy or so often
<PB N="191" REF="205"/>
as the Tradesman; but to fall into the very
Dirt of Scandal and Reproach, and rise with
Reputation; to fall with Infamy, and rise
with Applause; to fall detested, and rise
caressed and embraced by all Mankind; this
I think is a kind of Peculiar to the Trades∣man;
nay, to the unhappy unfortunate
Tradesman, who by this one Turn of his
Affairs, is lifted out of the Mire into a Sta∣tion
of Life, infinitely superior to the best
Condition he was ever in before.</P>
<P>AND this abundantly supports the Title
of this Chapter, namely, that a Tradesman
is never too low to rise: But let the Reader
of this Part take this with him as he goes,
that it must be attended still with a previous
Honesty, or else the other Part follows also,
of which I have spoken already, That he is
never too high to fall.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">That a Tradesman, though standing himself

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>F it would not offend the flourishing
Tradesman too much, I might here
put in a Caution for his Use; and
<PB N="192" REF="206"/>
I think 'tis the more seasonable here, because
I too often find that Tradesmen are apt to
be the forwardest in the Offence, I mean,
that of triumphing in the Misfortunes, and
over the Persons of their Neighbours in Dis∣tress.</P>
<P>NOR is it sufficient to triumph, as I say,
in their Misfortunes, but they generally are
the forwardest to reproach their Names, en∣ter
into the Particulars of their Conduct, and
heap Scandal upon them as well as Shame.</P>
<P>IT is true, that 'tis hard for a Tradesman
to fall, but that some Charge may lie against
his Morals, some Reproach may be rais'd
upon his Management; and no Man is so
capable of seeing into this Part, as his Neigh∣bour
Tradesman. I have touch'd at some
of those in the former Volume, such as
breaking his Word in Appointments of Pay∣ment,
which depending upon other Appoint∣ments,
may be unavoidable, and many other
Cases, wherein it must be said for the poor
Tradesman, that the best Man that ever
broke or fail'd in Trade, has been obliged
to do those Things in his Distress, which at
other Times his very Soul abhorred, and
which he looks back upon with the utmost
Regret and Self∣eproach.</P>
<P>AND as I said, the best Tradesman that
ever failed, may do thus; so I must add, the
better the Tradesman is, the more this Reflec∣tion
afflicts him, when he looks back upon
<PB N="193" REF="207"/>
those Things: And as we are directed in the
Lord's Prayer to say, <HI>Deliver us from
Evil</HI> so a poor declining, and yet conscien∣tious
Tradesman ought to say, <HI>Deliver us</HI>
from the <HI>horrid Necessity</HI> of doing <HI>Evil.</HI>
Indeed, it may be called a Necessity of do∣ing
Evil; for such it is to the Tradesman,
and it is an absolute Necessity, unavoidable
to him; he must do these Things, or sink
into Destruction immediately.</P>
<P>IT is true, strictly speaking, he ought to
sink, he ought to perish, rather than do it:
When he has his Neighbour's Bread in his
keeping, he ought to starve, and see Wife and
Children starve and perish, rather than touch
it; but where is the Man? or, who is the Man
that can resist the absolute Necessity? and
therefore the wise Prayer of <HI>Agar</HI> is very
significant, <HI>Give me not Poverty, lest I
steal, Prov. xxx.</HI> 9. The Meaning is plain,
Keep me from Poverty; for I fear if I am
distress'd, I should not be honest.</P>
<P>AGAIN, the very Text itself speaks, tho'
not in favour of the Crime, yet in great
Compassion and Pity for the Criminal Men:
<HI>Do not despise a Thief that steals to satissfy
his Hunger,</HI> Prov. vi. 30. Not that the
Text encourages Thest on any Account;
but 'tis evidently implied, that the Neces∣sity
is too great to be supported; that Hun∣ger
will make Men turn Thieves. And let
human Nature speak for itself: Will the
<PB N="194" REF="208"/>
honestest Man alive perish for Hunger, and
not touch his Neighbours Loaf, when it is
in his keeping? I tell you, he will not eat
his Neighbour's Loaf only, but eat his
Neighbour himself, ay, and crave a Bles∣sing
to the Food too, as has been known to
be the Case in many Distresses that have hap∣pen'd
in the World.</P>
<Q><P>DISTRESS is an Article which human Na∣ture
is not equal to.</P>
<P>TEN Men are in a Boat at Sea; they
have no Food to eat, no Water to
drink: Hunger is raging: One of them,
a good Man, abhors an evil Action;
and goes on till he is in the utmost A∣gony;
he dares not kill himself, that
is Self-Murder, and leaves no Room
for Repentance.</P>
<P>THE Extremity increases, he grows ra∣venous,
and his Eye is evil against his
Neighbour's Life; they fall upon one,
and kill and devour him, and yet pe∣rish;
he lies down, and mourns with the
Horror, and wishes for Death; but the
Rage of Hunger increasing, they draw
Lots for Life, and do the same Thing
again.</P></Q>
<P>THE poor Tradesman's Case is the same
in Degree: He has not his Neighbour in∣deed
with him in the Boat, but he has his
<PB N="195" REF="209"/>
Neighbour's Bread with him, that is to say,
his Neighbour's Stock, his Goods, or his
Money, are embarked with him, and he de∣vours
them; that is to say, he makes use of
them in his Distress to relieve himself, per∣haps
to keep himself from an Arrest and a
Jail, or to bring himself out of a Prison,
when he is put in, which is still worse.</P>
<P>THESE are the heavy Distresses of the
Tradesman, overwhelm'd with the Difficul∣ties
of his Business; and this is really to sa∣tisfy
his Soul, as the Scripture expresses it,
when he is hungry; and this, with the same
Text, calls for our Pity, not our Reproach.</P>
<P>IT is upon that Account I mention it;
not that I justify the Tradesman acting thus,
and think, as I have already said, such a
Tradesman should chuse to shut up, and
call his People together, before it comes to
that Length. But I am not talking to him
now, but to his rich flourishing Neighbour:
When I directed my Speech to the Trades∣man
himself, I gave him such Advice as I
think was suitable to his Case.</P>
<P>BUT now I speak to the rich Tradesman,
that looks on with Smiles upon the Cala∣mity
of his Neighbour; that triumphs over
his Disaster, and loads him with Reproaches,
adding Sorrow to the Afflicted, and Grief
to the Miserable: To such I must say, in
the Words of the Text, though meant of
another Kind of Standing, <HI>Let him that
<PB N="196" REF="210"/>
thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall,</HI>
1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 12. and 'tis observable, the Cau∣tion
in the Text is not to him <HI>that standeth,</HI>
but him <HI>that thinketh he standeth;</HI> intima∣ting,
that Men may think themselves safe,
when they are not so, and may but think
they stand.</P>
<P>IF it be so in Religion, much more is it
so in Trade: Here Men may really think
they stand, and that they are past Danger,
and many Times are in such Circumstances
as would almost justify any Body's thinking
so; and were their Thoughts bounded, and
their Ambition duly limited, they might be
said to be out of Danger; but as I have
said, that a Tradesman is never out of Dan∣ger
till he is out of Trade, so he is never
out of Danger till his Desires of having more
are limited; he is never too high to fall, till
he is once so high as to aim no higher.</P>
<P>AMBITION is Avarice in a Tradesman;
in a Courtier it is to be in great Posts; in
a Soldier to be in great Command; but in
a Tradesman it is to have a great Estate: It
is indeed Covetousness in them all, and
Pride in them all; so we count them capital
Vices among all; but the End is the same,
tho' the different Views differ with the Men.
In short, the Courtier's Avarice is to be great
in State and in Figure; and the Tradesman's
Ambition is to be rich in his Business; and as
'tis in one, so 'tis in both; while the Ambition,
<PB N="197" REF="211"/>
the Avarice remains, the Tradesman is
never out of Danger any more than the
Statesman.</P>
<P>THE Inference is the same as before: If
not out of Danger of falling yourself, take
heed then, how you carry it to those that do
fall: To the afflicted Tradesman Pity should
be shewn, as the Scripture says, <HI>To him that
is afflicted Pity should be shewn by his Friend.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Method now is to trample upon,
and triumph over the Afflictions of the
poor overwhelm'd Tradesman; and that by
his Neighbour Tradesman, who perhaps is
not many Year after him, nor long behind
him in the same Calamity.</P>
<P>NOR does this trampling on his Disaster
consist only in the Triumph of the Tongue,
adding Insults and Reproaches to his Cala∣mity;
but it is a formal Charge or Accusa∣tion
against his Morals; loading him with
Scandal, and indeed is an Indictment against
him in Form; which the Tradesman ought
not to do, unless he can prove the Facts,
and unless he will appear before the Com∣missioners
of Bankrupt, or in some Court
of Justice, and legally prosecute the same.</P>
<P>THIS makes me speak it with the more
Earnestness, that the rich Tradesman, or
supposedly standing Tradesman, should <HI>take
heed lest he fall;</HI> that is, in the Sense of the
present Case, should act as if he was not sure,
as no Tradesman is, that he shall not fall;
<PB N="198" REF="212"/>
he should act with Prudence, with Modesty,
and with Charity.</P>
<P>AND this the more, because as that he
is not sure he <HI>shall not fall,</HI> so is not sure
the Tradesman, poor and discourag'd, sunk
and demolish'd as he is, shall not yet rise
again. That Text in <HI>Micah,</HI> however
meant in and applied to another Case, may
be justly applied to this of the Tradesman,
<HI>Micah</HI> vii. 8. <HI>Rejoice not against me, O
mine Enemy, when I fall; I shall arise,</HI>
&amp;c.</P>
<P>NO Men rise oftner out of the deepest
Distresses than the ruin'd Tradesmen of this
particular Nation: 'Tis observable that it is
not so easy to recover the ruin'd Fortunes
of a Tradesmen in other Nations, as it is
of this: The Reasons for that are, not that
the Tradesinen in this Nation are less dili∣gent
and indefatigable than in other Coun∣tries;
I wish I could say it was so; nay, I
wish I could say it was not just the contra∣ry;
but I believe it to be owing to the
great Flux of Business which is carried on
here; which is certainly greater in <HI>Eng∣land</HI>
than in any other Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI>
or in the whole World; and we shall see
more into that Part when the Magnitude of
the <HI>English</HI> or <HI>British</HI> Commerce comes to
be spoken of.</P>
<P>THE <HI>English</HI> Tradesman is a kind of
<HI>Phooenix,</HI> who often rises out of his own
<PB N="199" REF="213"/>
Ashes, and makes the Ruin of his Fortunes
be a firm Foundation to build his Recove∣ry:
Indeed there is something in the first
Ruin of a Tradesman, that furnishes him
effectually to stand the firmer for the Time
to come.</P>
<P>NO Man is so well caution'd against Di∣sasters,
so well warn'd against Mischief of
all Kinds, so well fortified against false
Measures, as a ruin'd Tradesman; he knows
what has once blown him up; If it was
high Living before, he goes on the more
frugally now: If it was hard Drinking before,
he lives temperately now: If it was keeping
Company before, he keeps his Shop now:
And by these new Measures he conquers
first himself, and then all his Misfortunes;
he becomes not only a new Man, but a
new Tradesman; makes a new Figure in
the World, and all his former Mistakes are
forgotten: He is as if he had never been
otherwise: The World is reconcil'd to him
in a Moment: If his former Circumstances
are recover'd, his Reputation is doubled;
and I know no Man that sinks with greater
Hope, and rises again with greater Advan∣tage
than the <HI>British</HI> Tradesman.</P>
<P>THIS, if there was nothing else in it,
should make their Neighbour Tradesman
cautious how they ill use them in their Mis∣fortunes
and Afflictions, and how they tri∣umph
and trample over them, as if they
<PB N="200" REF="214"/>
were like Trees twice dead, and pluck'd up
by the Roots.</P>
<P>HOW ill does it look upon a Neighbour
Tradesman to rejoice over the Miscarriage
of a poor Tradesman his Neighbour, or perhaps
his Debtor? I say, how ill does it look upon
him when the poor Tradesman, working
through his Difficulties, comes to set up
again just at his Door, and he sees the Cus∣tomers
flock to his Shop, and that he rises
in Credit, in Business, and in Stock?</P>
<P>BUT to come back to the poor, broken,
dislocated, comfortless, Tradesman, that has
fallen under his Misfortunes, as I said to
him before; <HI>Nil Desperandum;</HI> let him
never despair, never give out, never abate
his Diligence: If one Thing will not do,
try another; be always attempting, always
hoping; and 'tis on this Account I men∣tion
it; when I say he should despair of
nothing, it is to introduce this Part, <HI>viz,</HI>
always hoping.</P>
<P>HOPE is the strongest Spur to Diligence;
he that works without Hope will never
hold it long: It is true, 'tis the Fault of
some Men, that they are always hoping,
even when it is groundless, and consequent∣ly
sruitless; they hope with a causeless
Expectation; hope without Views; are full
of Expectations from Emptiness and Air;
and this is the Reason, that if they are full
of any Thing, it is of Disappointment.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="215"/>
How should these Men fail of Disap∣pointments,
who anticipate their own Sor∣rows,
by fixing their Hopes upon incapable
Objects. This is, as when a Ship is sinking to
take hold of an Anchor, or of one of the
great Guns to get to Shore upon, instead of
a spare Top∣ast,
or a spare Yard; the
latter may float the Man to the Land, the
former will sink him directly to the Bot∣tom.</P>
<P>AS long as the Tradesman has any Hope,
so long he will be sure to struggle with his
Misfortunes; and as long as he can struggle,
he may hope: A Tradesman is the best fit∣ted
to struggle with Disasters of any Part
of Mankind: The Soldier, indeed, takes up
a Mankind: The Soldier, indeed, takes up
a Musket, or gets a Commission, and ha∣ving
a hundred thousand to one Odds against
him, is knock'd on the Head, or rises to
something: The Scholar, got into Misfor∣tune,
is good for just nothing, but to scrib∣ble
for Bread; write Poems, and as Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI> says,
<Q>To daub the Vile, and compliment the Great.</Q></P>
<P>BUT the Tradesman can live in any
Part of the World; give him but Liberty,
and something to begin with, he will not
fail to engage in something or other that
may turn to Account. How many Trades∣men,
after being ruin'd in <HI>England,</HI> have
<PB N="202" REF="216"/>
gone to the <HI>East Indies</HI> at the mean Salary
of 20<HI>l.</HI> a Year, and have come home with
as many Thousands in their Pockets? How
many have gone to other of our Colonies
empty, in the Nature of Servants, and are
now resident there, in the Quality of conside∣rable
Planters, or come home again with Es∣tates.</P>
<P>NO People in the World recover the
most desperate and hopeless Circumstances, or
work through the most inextricable Difficul∣ties
like them.</P>
<P>IF the Tradesman is never to despair of
his own Circumstances, then we should ne∣ver
give him up for lost, and use him as if
he was dead, and never to rise: As he is
the most likely to rise again when he falls,
so we have the least Reason to think him
lost when we see him down: The Advice,
then, is to him that thinketh he standeth, to
use tenderly those that fall.</P>
<P>BUT to come to the Fact: The poor Dis∣tress'd
Tradesman has been, as others be∣fore
him have been, oblig'd to do many
Things, which otherwise he would not
have done; he has been oblig'd to run in
Debt when he would not; to take Money
when he could not refund it; to touch
Trusts committed to him; to promise Pay∣ment,
and break Promises: And what is the
Meaning of all this? His Distress has driven
<PB N="203" REF="217"/>
him to it: The rich Man upbraids him with
it, and says, he never did thus and thus.</P>
<P>YOU never did so: Was you ever tried?
Was you ever distressed to make Payment,
and did not promise without a Prospect?
Was you ever in Prison, and would not
make use of another Man's Money entrust∣ed
with you, to fetch you out?</P>
<P>HE is the honest Man that has stood the
Test of the ordinary and extraordinary
Question in that Case; who can say he has
starved rather than touch his Neighbour's
Loaf: 'Tis he that can pay, and will not,
that is the Knave; but for him that would
pay, and cannot, he may be as honest as he
that does pay because he can.</P>
<P>WHEN the poor Broken Tradesman first
fails, he bears all these Reproaches, that's
true; but when he rises again, and pays
every Man punctually again, not needing
to do it, having been legally discharged,
then he shines brighter than before, and ob∣tains
a brighter Character than he that never
fail'd at all.</P>
<P>AS then the Fortunes of the rich Trades∣man
are never known till he is dead, so the
Fate of the Bankrupt is not concluded while
he is alive; his Principles are not fully
shewn, and therefore his Actions should not
be censur'd till his Bottom is wound off, till
he has done with the World, and the World
with him.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="218"/>
LET us look at both the Tradesmen, the
low and the high: Their Characters are
known by the Conclusion, and not before;
as I have said above. Death only deter∣mines
their Characters; the poor diligent
Tradesman, recovering from his Misfortunes
and shewing his Honesty in the fairest
Manner, yet may fail again; he may meet
with Disasters again, ay, and again; and
we often see Men fail three Times over,
and more; and yet go to their Graves, as
we may, in their own Coaches, pick up
their Fortunes at last, and die rich.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, we have seen flou∣rishing
Tradesmen carry it on with a full
Credit, and a great Stroke of Business to
the last, and when they have died, not leave
enough to bury them, nay, not enough to
pay five Shillings in the Pound: So various,
so uncertain is the Scene of a Tradesman's
Life: And hence it came to be a proverbial
Saying, <HI>That no Man knows what a Trades
man is till he is dead.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT then can the Tradesman say for
insulting the Reputation of an unfortunate
Brother? Let his own Bottom be wound
up first, and then he may speak with the
more Assurance; for a Tradesman neither
knows himself, or is known, till his Bottom
is wound off; and it greatly reproaches his
own Chararcter to have him triumph over
the Disasters of another.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="219"/>
THE antient Standard Tradesman has
also something to regard relating to his own
Reputation at the Close of his trading Days.</P>
<P>I have distinguish'd in the Character of a
Tradesman, between Credit and Reputation,
and the Distinction is very just.</P>
<P>THE Credit of a Tradesman consists in
his punctual Payment of his Bills, and De∣mands
of every Kind; and this Credit may
be untainted and spotless as to Trade, when
he may have no Reputation, as a Man of
Worth, a Man of Value, or as to his Morals,
or his personal and relative Conduct in his
Neighbourhood.</P>
<P>A Tradesman may have a thorough Credit
for Payment; that Men would trust him for
any Sum; that when Bills were accepted,
they are paid to a Day, to a Tittle; and
yet take him in his other Part, even of his
Dealings, he has no Reputation; that he
will bite every Man he can, oppress the
Poor in his Bargains; take all Advantages
in Trade; that he will do nothing but what
he may be forc'd to, nothing but what he
can't help: The usual Saying of such a
Man is, <HI>That he is an honest Man with
good looking to; that he will be always
honest when 'tis for his own Interest:</HI> And
indeed 'tis well among some People, if
so much as that could be gained of them.

<PB N="205" REF="221"/>
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page duplicate〉"/></P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="222"/>
BUT he is the Tradesman of Credit and
Reputation, who is known to be a fair and
generous Tradesman, that will own a ver∣bal
Bargain, and not prevaricate and deny
Facts, because they are not to be shewn
under Hand and Seal; that when he is char∣ged
upon his Word, will acknowledge the
Promise, will perform the Condition, and
will not take the Advantage to defraud his
Dealers on frivolous Pretences, and find
Holes to creep out to evade Contracts not
to his Mind, and break his Word to save
his Interest.</P>
<P>THERE'S many a Tradesman, whose
Credit will pass in Trade, or upon <HI>Ex∣change,</HI>
for ten thousand Pound, who yet
has the Name of a Rogue and a Knave in
his ordinary Dealing, and will die, at least
die out of Trade, blasted and branded with
Infamy, as an unfair Dealer, as a Man of
no Probity, no Character, and that would
seldom do a fair Thing.</P>
<P>CREDIT is supported by a good Fund of
Money; and he shall always be trusted in
Trade that pays punctually.</P>
<P>BUT Reputation is supported by Hones∣ty,
by fair, and punctual, and honourable
Dealings; by a generous clean Behaviour
in Trade, and by acting upon all Occasions
as an honest Man, though without Com∣pulsion,
and without Necessity.</P>
<P><PB N="207" REF="223"/>
To bring this home to the present Case;
the rich over∣rown
Tradesman may have
the first of these; his Credit may be good
and untouch'd, no Man doubts his Ability;
but his Reputation may be good for no∣thing;
he may be an immoral Man, an un∣just,
a cozening, cheating Knave at the
Bottom, and that in Trade too, and yet his
Credit for Payment be perfectly good.</P>
<P>HE may be branded with over reaching,
circumventing,
trapaning his Neighbours,
taking all Advantages, just or unjust, not
valuing his Word, or being to be bound by
any Thing but Hand and Seal; in a Word,
he may be a compleat Knave, and yet, as
to his punctual Payment, be as compleat a
Tradesman as can be desir'd.</P>
<P>AND what is the Reputation of such a Man
good for? Let him be as rich as a <HI>Tysson,</HI>
or a <HI>Cutler,</HI> if he has not the Character of
an honest Tradesman, as well as substan∣tial
Tradesman, what is it good for? and
of what Value is such a Man in the Place
where he dwells? He dies with the Re∣proaches
of the Rich, and with the Curses
of the Poor.</P>
<P>NOR indeed is it rightly to be called Ho∣nesty,
that a Tradesman pays his Bills cur∣rently,
that he pays Ready Money for
what he buys, or, to put it into Trades∣mens
Words, that he buys all for Ready
Money: All this he may do without one
<PB N="208" REF="224"/>
Grain of Principle; when his Bills are ac∣cepted,
he must pay them to save his Cre∣dit,
or to avoid Force; in a Word, he is in
all that, only honest, <HI>as we say,</HI> because he
can't help it.</P>
<P>HE buys for Ready Money, that is, be∣cause
he would buy cheaper than ordinary;
and he pays Ready Money because he buys
so, and must do it, or else no Man will sell
Goods to him at a Readymoney
Price ano∣ther
Time.</P>
<P>IN a word, he buys his Credit by these
Things, and he is honest because he cannot
help it; as many Men are not Thieves only
for fear of the Gallows; and as another Pro∣verb
says, though profanely, <HI>That</HI> God
<HI>would have few Servants if the</HI> Devil
<HI>were dead;</HI> but there is not one Dram of
Principle in all this: It is far from deser∣ving
so much as the Name of Honesty; and
the Tradesman may do this, and yet be as
great a K—as any walks the <HI>Exchange,</HI>
or that opens a Shop in the whole Kingdom.</P>
<P>HONESTY is quite another Thing: A tru∣ly
honest Tradesman would be so if no
Body was Witness to it; would keep his
Word to a Tittle, though no Body heard
him promise: He scorns to undermine or
circumvent his Neighbour, but acts the
friendly Part to the Rich, and the generous
Part to the Poor; oppresses no Man, grinds
no Man, takes no unjust Advantages against
<PB N="209" REF="225"/>
any Man, but witnesses against himself, as
well as for himself, upon all Occasions.</P>
<P>THIS Distinction between Credit and Re∣putation,
as it is very needful in Trade, so 'tis
very just to the Tradesmen; for many Men
go to their Graves with the just Character
of Knave, dishonest, unjust, who yet die
in full Credit, as Tradesmen, and leave im∣mense
Wealth behind them. I could name
some Tradesmen in <HI>London,</HI> who have died
worth a hundred thousand Pounds in Estate,
who could not with all the Money have
purchased their Reputation of honest Men,
no, nor with ten Times the Money.</P>
<P>REPUTATION is not to be purchas'd by
Money; 'tis rais'd by Probity, and Prudence
of Conduct, and by that only; a long Series
of generous and just Dealings, open Evidences
of an Integrity of Mind, these bear Wit∣ness
to themselves, and give a Character.</P>
<P>CREDIT, indeed, is gain'd by Money:
When we want to credit a Man in Trade, we
ask, is he able? is he rich? if you are once
satisfied of the Ability, you are satisfied to
trust the Man, and sell your Goods; for
says the Tradesman selling, <HI>Let him but
buy; if he is able, I'll make him willing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>How much better is Reputation than this
Credit? I mean to the Man, as a Man, and
as a Christian: It must be acknowledged,
as the Times go now, it will not go so far
in Trade as the Credit:</HI> Let the Man be
<PB N="210" REF="226"/>
the greatest Sharper and Cheat in the City,
if he is but able, we'll take his Bills, trust
him with our Goods, and hazard with him
upon all Adventures, because we depend
upon the Law, as above, to make him wil∣ling.</P>
<P>BUT what imports his Honesty to us
in Trade; if the Man be not able, his
Honesty may make us value him, but 'tis
his Ability that makes us trust him, and
trade with him. <HI>And this, I doubt not,
makes so many Tradesmen (too many in∣deed)
value their Credit so much above
their Conscience; of which I had rather say
nothing than speak all the Truth.</HI></P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="9" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">That the rich Tradesman leaving off, should
endeavour to quit the World of Trade in
Peace, and go off in a Calm, with the
good Word of the Rich, and the Bles∣sings
of the Poor, and whatever he was
before, be well spoken of at last.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Bring all this back to the antient
substantial Tradesman, that talks
of leaving off, and being grown
rich, begins to flack his Hand in
<PB N="211" REF="227"/>
Business; is, as it were, satisfied with what
he has, and tired with the Hurry of the
World: It cannot but be to the Advantage
of this Tradesman to come off clean, to
wind up the Bottom well, without any
tangled Skeins behind; to leave no Broils
upon the Hands of his Successors in Trade,
and no Slurs upon his Reputation that
gave it over.</P>
<P>IT is true, that a Tradesman leaving off,
is not under the same absolute Necessity of
guarding himself, to raise a Credit, and sup∣port
his Character for the Support of his
Business; but 'tis still of some Weight to
a Tradesman, to maintain the Reputation
which he had, and to go off well, that he
may not go out of Busines, as some go out
of the World, like the Snuff of a Candle,
with a Smoke and a Stink.</P>
<P>IF he has been a cunning, sharping, bi∣ting,
overreaching
Wretch; if he has put
<HI>Torkshire</HI> upon the World all his Days, and
set up Craft for Honesty, 'tis Time to leave
it off at last, and, if he can, to recover
himself, and get a better Name to go off
the Stage with; as the worst Malefactors,
repent when they come to the Gallows, and
gain our Pity at last by their Penitence, if
they could not by their Crime; so the most
unfair designing rich Tradesman may (at
the Close) do some handsome Things to re∣store
his good Name, and reconcile the
<PB N="212" REF="228"/>
common Opinion to him at his going off;
and 'tis better late than never, like the Peo∣ple
in some Countries, who cheat and lye,
oppress, deceive, and run through a long
Life of scandalous Injustice in their Busi∣ness,
and then, with the Money they have
screw'd out of the Poor, build an Hospital,
and settle Revenues and Masses to hire
Prayers to be said for them.</P>
<P>BUT I would suppose our Tradesman
not so bad as that; I am not a rating him
with the worst neither, but suppose him to
be a Man that, it may be, has been a little
sharp and hard, and the World has found
fault with him; he has not so good a Name
as some of his Neighbours in his Business,
and now he is drawing out: I would re∣commend
it to such a Tradesman, I say, to
come off clean, pay every Man handsomely,
wrangle with no Body, bring no contested
Accounts, no Quarrels, no Suits at Law
along with him; but, as he pretends, to sit
down easy, so I would advise him to sit
down so, as to make every Body easy with
him.</P>
<P>A Man may be easy himself, in oppres∣sing
and wronging every Body else, and
going off with the Spoils of the Poor; but
if he would have the World be easy too, he
must do every Thing clean and fair by
them at last, as well as by himself: A Man
that leaves his Business with the Reproach
<PB N="213" REF="229"/>
of a thousand little Quarrels about his Ears,
rather hides himself from the World, than
sits down to enjoy it: All the Tradesman's
Accounts should be fairly and quietly clos'd,
all Disputes calmly ended, and all Mouths
friendly stopp'd.</P>
<P>IT is an uncomfortable Thing to be pur∣sued
from the Shop to the Retreat, where∣ever
it is, or may be, with the Glamours
of oppressed Families, the Noise of the
Poor, or the Insults of the Rich: I am to
suppose, if a Tradesman is leaving off, it
is with the usual Saying of the rich Men
that withdraw from the World, <HI>That he
may enjoy himself; that he may live in
Quiet and Peace at the latter End of
his Days, without Noise, and without
Hurry.</HI> And how can that be done, when
the remaining Disputes of twenty Years
standing continue unsettled, and all the lit∣tle
Brangles of forty Years Trade hang upon
and haunt him to the last?</P>
<P>IF he would die in Peace, he must live
in Peace, make Peace with every Body be∣fore
he dies: The Tradesman leaving his
Shop, is like another Man's leaving the
World; he should resolve to die in Charity
with all Men: It is a trading Death; he
dies out of Trade as much as another dies
out of the World; he should therefore en∣deavour
to go off in a Calm.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="230"/>
BUT a little farther, to explain myself: I do
not mean by this that he should close all Ac∣counts
only, and pay every Man his Due and
just Demands; for that he must do, or else
they will say he <HI>goes off,</HI> not <HI>goes out of
Trade;</HI> that he is broke, not that he leaves
off; that he is a rich Bankrupt, and a thou∣sand
other nameless Things, which no Man
would care to have said of him.</P>
<P>A Tradesman is not properly said to
have quite left off, or be out of Business,
just by his shutting up his Shop, or put∣ting
another into it; unless he has evened
all Differences, and adjusted all his Disputes
with the World: 'Tis not enough that he
has paid all his Debts, (as he calls it,) if
there are open Accounts and Demands, ei∣ther
upon him, or by him upon others; the
Man is still involved, and, which is worse,
embroil'd with the World: Those tan∣gled
Skeins are as apt to raise Slurs, and
bring Scandal upon him at parting, as any
Thing whatever; and the avoiding these
Things as much as may be, is at least a Part
of what I call going quietly out of Trade,
and parting friendly with the World.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY I lay the Stress of this upon
such Cases, and such Disputes, wherein he
is Plaintiff, not Defendant; where perhaps
he is injurious, or at least is said to be so,
and rigid in his Demands; taking the utmost
Advantages in Accounts, upon the Defi∣ciency
<PB N="215" REF="231"/>
of a Debtor's Books; for all Trades∣men
are not Accomptants; all are not equal∣ly
careful; here Parcels of Goods may be
deliver'd to him, and yet the Persons not
able to make due Proof; there Receipts for
Money may be mislaid, or not be carefully
preserved, or perhaps Money has been paid,
and the Receipt omitted, and the rich Trades∣man,
at finishing his Accounts, refuses to
allow them, though perhaps he knows it
just, taking Advantage of the other's Neg∣ligence:
In all these Cases, the Tradesman
brings an ill Character upon himself; and
this he should industriously avoid: He ought
to acknowledge Goods that he knows he has
had deliver'd, Money that he knows he has
received; and not putting the poor Trades∣man
upon the Proof of Things, when he
knows he has some Advantage of his Neg∣ligence:
He ought not to take Mistake for
a Balance, and make a poor Tradesman
Debtor to his Ignorance; such an Act of
open Honesty, acknowledging Money paid,
though without a Receipt, and Goods deli∣ver'd,
though without an Evidence, will
do him more Honour in Trade, besides the
Justice of it, than ever Money, twice de∣manded,
will do him good.</P>
<P>ALSO by leaving off quietly, and going out
of Trade in a Calm, I mean, that he should
do generous and kind Things by the World at
parting; not exacting the utmost Penny with
<PB N="216" REF="232"/>
Severity, where it cannot be had without
Distress; not doing hard Things by any
Man, which at another Time he would not
do upon the Score of farther Trade; and
tear Mankind to Pieces, because, or with
this Expression, <HI>What do I value disob∣liging
him, I shall trade no more with him,
I shall get no more by him, and therefore
I will have my Money.</HI></P>
<P><HI>TRADESMEN often, nay, generally for∣bear
a Customer, though he be far in Debt,</HI>
Because, <HI>says the Creditor,</HI> he is a good
Customer, though a little long-winded, and
I deal considerably with him, and am every
Day getting Money by him; and if I am
hard upon him, I shall disoblige him, and
los my Customer; <HI>and so he lets him owe
a considerable Sum.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when he leaves off, then the Scene
changes: I have done Trade; I expect to
get no more by him; I have nothing to do
but to get in my Debts; what care I for
his Good-will or his Ill-will; I must have
my Money, and will have it: And so he
falls upon the poorer Tradesman with Vio∣lence
and Cruelty; and the Man, not able
to pay him all at once, is undone, and
breaks.</P>
<P>BY this Method the rich Tradesman may
indeed hurry in those of his Debts that are
current, and where the Debtors are able;
and though it is with Difficulty to many,
<PB N="217" REF="233"/>
yet they that are any way in Condition to pay,
will do it; but two Things will certainly
follow: First, Those that pay him in that
Manner, and especially those that do it
with Difficulty, will reproach him with In∣civility
and Ingratitude, after long, fair,
and friendly Usage, and after having gain'd
many Thousands or Hundreds of Pounds
by them.</P>
<P>AND those who cannot bear the Hurry,
though with Patience and easy good Usage
they might have paid all, yet are overthrown,
and fall under the Violence, sink, and are
undone; and so the eager, merciless, but
avaricious Creditor, loses the Debt he might
have sav'd, and gains the Scandal of a cruel
Creditor into the Bargain.</P>
<P>THIS Way of leaving off Trade is like
one of the Pagan Emperors, that when he
went out of the World, would have had all
the best Men of his Court, and some that
had serv'd him most faithfully, and the best
and wealthiest of the Nobility, put to
Death, that the World might mourn for
his Death in the Persons of their Friends,
who had not died, if the Emperor had liv'd.</P>
<P>THUS the rich Tradesman, acting with
Violence and Cruelty, leaves off with the
Ill-ill; and ill Word of every Body; car∣rying
off the Spoils of the Trade, as well
as off the poor oppressed Tradesman; and
will he call this leaving off, and Retiring?
<PB N="218" REF="234"/>
he should rather call it running away from
the just Clamours of the Poor, and remo∣ving
himself only out of the Hearing of it;
like a Man that sets his own House on Fire
to burn his Neighbour's, but takes care to
get out of the Way, that he may not be
burnt himself.</P>
<P>AS nothing is of more Value to a Trades∣man,
while in Business, than his Credit,
so nothing can be of more Value to him
at his going out of Business, than his Re∣putation:
To trade fairly, and leave off
handsomely, finishes a Tradesman's Scene of
Life, and finishes it the most to his Advan∣tage,
and in the best Manner he can desire;
he goes off with Applause; he can ask his
Friends, as <HI>Augustus</HI> did, at his Death,
if he had acted his Part well; and can say
to them with <HI>Augustus, Plaudite,</HI> and go
off smiling.</P>
<P>FOR any Tradesman to say he does not
value the Tongues of Men, or care what
the World says of him, is to talk like a De∣sperado,
not like a wise Man; for tho' (while
acting justly and prudently) it is a Part of Wis∣dom,
and of a true Greatness of Mind not
to value what the World says slanderously
and unjustly of us; yet it is always the Stu∣dy
of good and wise Men, and is not unwor∣thy
that Greatness of Mind, to act so as
that no Evil can be spoken justly, and with
Cause.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="235"/>
EVERY wise Man studies to merit the
the Praise of wise and good Men, and to
merit it by wise and good Actions: To be
evil spoken of may be the Lot of a good
Man; but to be spoken of for Evil, is only
the just Due of a Criminal: 'Tis one Thing
to be accused, and 'tis another Thing to be
falsely accused; as 'tis one Thing be char∣ged
with a Crime, and another Thing to be
guilty; the first a wise Man laughs at, the
last he trembles at.</P>
<P>BUT not to run this up to a Part too
pungent, and to make it seem piquant and
particular, my Meaning is clear; as Repu∣tation
and Credit in Business is a Treasure,
and esteemed so by all Tradesmen, as Dea∣lers,
so to go with Reputation out of Busi∣ness,
is a Treasure every Man should esteem
and covet, as a wise Man and as a Christian.</P>
<P>NOW no Man has more Advantage in this
Particular than a Tradesman, if his Cha∣racter
was any thing tolerable before: By
leaving off well, he puts himself in a Ca∣pacity
of forming a compleat Fame, as to
Business; nay, if he had but an indifferent
good Name before, yet if he goes off clean,
he wipes out all the Blots at once, if they
are not too indelible, and have not, like a
Tincture in Grain, stain'd too deep to be
discharg'd.</P>
<P>BY going out of Trade clean, I mean
closing the trading Scene without the Cla∣mour
<PB N="220" REF="236"/>
of the Poor; without Quarrels from
the Rich; without the Charge of fraudulent
Accounts, cavilling and litigious Wran∣glings
upon Trifles, denied or revoked A∣greements,
Bargains relinquish'd and dis∣owned,
only because disadvantageous; with∣out
suffering Suits for just Debts, and op∣pressing
poor Men, even in reasonable De∣mands;
and many other Cases, which serve
only to sully the Character of a Trades∣man
at his going off.</P>
<P>THE Tradesman and the World, like a
Master and an old Servant, should part lo∣vingly,
without Reslections and Ill∣ill;
and
this cannot be done without taking care
to leave no old Scores between them un∣balanced.
To go out of Trade with the
Clamours of Mankind, loaded with Re∣proach,
and follow'd with Imprecations,
and a general Censure on their ordinary
Actions, as well as extraordinary; what is
this but declaring War with the World, and
biding human Nature Defiance.</P>
<P>A Tradesman that has been in good Busi∣ness,
must necessarily have a large Acquain∣tance;
his Employment requires it; at his
laying down, he drops his general Know∣ledge
of the World, his common and ordi∣nary
Society, and reserves only a particular
chosen few, who he sets by to call Friends;
forms an Interest of Intimacy and Friend∣ship
<PB N="221" REF="237"/>
with them, and preserves it after the
rest are all dropp'd and forgotten.</P>
<P>BUT he does not commence a Breach with
all the rest; neither does the singling out
a few particular Friends for his Confidence
and Company, intimate, that he should dis∣oblige
any Body; no Man then can be af∣fronted
that he is not made a Friend, because
he was a Customer, or claim that he should
be a particular Friend afterward, because he
was a general Acquaintance before.</P>
<P>THIS therefore is not the Case; but my
Meaning is, that the Tradesman should not,
as the Month of <HI>March</HI> is said to do some∣times,
invert the Course of Things, and
coming in like a Lamb, go out like a Lion:
Trade is indeed a Scene of Hurry some∣times,
and the more Business the more Noise;
but the Man is not bound to live in a Hurry,
and die in a Storm: In a word, every
wealthy Tradesman, who is a Man of
Sense, will strive, at his laying down his
Business, to do it with the Smiles of his
Friends, and the good Word of his Ene∣mies;
with the Blessings of the Poor, and
the Favour of the Rich.</P>
<P>THE End of this Discourse is chiefly di∣rected
to this Part; namely, That a Trades∣man
should not, for a few small petty Debts,
ruffle his poorer Debtors, and commence
Suits at Law with his Customers, upon this
old Foot, this ill-natured Conclusion, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="238"/>
That I have got all I can by them, and I will
lose nothing back again, if I can help it;
and as for their good Will, what is it to me?
I shall have no more to do with them, I
have no more Dealings with them; what do
I value their good or their ill Will?</P>
<P>ON the contrary, with what Advantage
does an honest Tradesman leave the World,
when he shews himself easy with his Deb∣tors,
giving Time to some, and even quit∣ting
others, where Pity calls for it? As a
good Christian dies in Charity with all the
World, so he goes off the Stage of Trade
with a general Kindness in his Breast to all
Mankind; he gives every one good Usage,
and receives the like; the Poor pray for him,
the Rich are fond of him, and all Men
speak well of him.</P>
<P>THIS is the Exit of a Compleat Trades∣man:
Hitherto I have been directing him
in his Way, I am now directing how to make
up his Bottom. There is as much need of
Council in a Tradesman's End, as there was
in his Beginning, only perhaps the last is
the more difficult; as 'tis always more diffi∣cult
to end wisely, than to begin wisely.</P>
<P>AS I know not whether of the two is the
most difficult in the Course of a Christian's
Life, to <HI>live well,</HI> or to <HI>die well;</HI> and 'tis
certain, that one depends very much upon
the other: So it is the same in Tradesmen;
if a Man has been a fair Trader all his Life,
<PB N="223" REF="239"/>
if he has acted justly and honourably in the
World, if he has been a generous open heart∣ed
Neighbour, a fair Dealer, quiet in his Dis∣position,
a Man of a wise prudent Manage∣ment,
he finds it as easy to preserve the good
Will of Mankind at last, as he did to gain
it at first; but if he has been a sharping, cun∣ning,
over-reaching
Dealer; if he has been
a cruel Biter and Devourer of the Poor that
laboured under him, obliging them to make
Brick without Straw, shortening their Wa∣ges,
but exacting, or rather increasing
their Work; making them first beg for Work,
and then beg for their Pay; taking Advan∣rages
of the Poverty of the Seller, to buy
under the true Worth of the Goods; and, in
a Word, oppressing, not the Tradesman on∣ly,
but the Trade itself; he meets with the
the Reward of it at last, and goes out of
Trade with as ill a Name as he lived in it;
he entails even upon his Memory, as a
Tradesman, the Curses of the Poor, the Re∣proaches
of the Rich, the ill Word of eve∣ry
Body, and has the good Word of no
Body.</P>
<P>THERE'S no Popery in Trade: Works of
Supererogation may be allowed here; and tho'
a Tradesman's Soul shall not be sav'd by his
own Merit, any more than that of another
Fellow-christian,
yet his Reputation may;
indeed, it shall or can be preserv'd by no other
Means: As he behaves, so he shall be es∣teem'd.
<PB N="224" REF="240"/>
It is true, the World may some∣times
run against a Man's Character, in a
strong Current of general Dislike, without
a due Cause, and common Fame does not al∣ways
do a Man Justice: But this is very rare,
and happens rather in other Things than in
Trade, as in publick Affairs, in Politicks, in
Religion and Opinion; and it is particular
to such Cases, because those Things general∣ly
run by Parties and Factions, by Schisms
and Divisions in Principles, and the like.</P>
<P>BUT in Trade it is very seldom thus; the
World is generally more just in this Part
of Life, than in any other Cases: If a
Tradesman is just and fair in his Dealings,
if he is compassionate and kind to the Poor;
if he performs his Agreements punctually,
and pays his poor Workmen chearfully and
generously; he carries the Fame of it after
him, and goes off, I mean at his laying
down Trade, with the good Will and the
good Word of all the World. Nay, which
is something unusual in most other Cases in
the World, they are as extravagant in their
Applause, as they are on the other Side
of their Clamour, and will set him as high
above his Merit, as they will run another
down below it.</P>
<P>AS then this is the Way of the World,
and that People do and will act thus by one
another in all such Cases, 'tis in the Trades∣man's
View, and consequently in his Choice,
<PB N="225" REF="241"/>
upon what Terms to stand with Mankind at
parting; and tho' 'tis true, a wise Man will
not overrate
the Popular Opinion, whether
for him or against him, yet I cannot but
think, every Man would rather go off the
Stage with the good Will of his Neigh∣bours,
than with a general Odium.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but recommend it to every
Tradesman to do so for this Reason, because
the Merit of <HI>the first</HI> is ordinarily founded
upon a just and human Course of Life, do∣ing
Things commendable and Praiswe∣orthy
in
themselves, and which a wise Man ought
to practise, whether they were rewarded with
due Acknowledgments from the World, or no.
On the other hand, the Merit of the second
is generally founded upon Justice too, that
is to say, the Man by a long Series of un∣fair
Dealing, or of unkind and cruel Usage,
and other, the ordinary Vices of a griping
over-reaching
Tradesman, justly brings those
Things upon himself; and he may so far be
properly said to suffer as an Evil-doer,
that
is to say, to suffer justly, which no wise
Man can desire to do.</P>
<P>THIS is the Reason why I lay so much
Weight upon that Point, and argue so much
for the Tradesman's laying down his Busi∣ness
upon good Terms with the World. I
am as much for despising Slander and Re∣proach
as any Man, and as any Man ought
to be. I think it a <HI>Brutum fulmen</HI> in its
<PB N="226" REF="242"/>
own Nature; 'tis a Thunder without a Bolt,
a Cannon fir'd without a Ball, Rage with∣out
a Weapon, a Snake without a Sting;
there's no true Satyr in it, and a good Man
has nothing to fear from it.</P>
<P>BUT then we must add this, that we
should be sure that it is really Slander, not
Scandal: Scandal is supposed to be the Lash
of a real Fact; Slander is the Scourge of
Falshood, and the Effect of Malice. He
that can despise the ill Tongues of Men, is
a Philosopher and a good Christian; but it
must be upon a Supposition, that he is inno∣cent
too, or else he acts neither Philosopher
or Christian, but goes upon a meer Stock of
<HI>Face,</HI> a kind of Hardness that I can hardly
give a Name to.</P>
<P>HE that can hold up his Face to the World,
in the Teeth of a general Clamour, and yet
be at the same Time guilty, and know in his
Conscience that he merits their Reproach,
and that they have Reason for what they
say, is arriv'd to a Degree something be∣yond
the Power of human Nature, even in
its utmost Degeneracy; and must have some
Assistance from one whose Name I need
not mention.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman's being Purse-proud; the
Folly and the Scandal of it; and how just∣ly
ridiculous it renders him in the World.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>S I have cautioned the Tradesman
against being secure in his Prosperi∣ty,
so I cannot quit him, without
saying a Word to him about his particular
personal Conduct in his Prosperity; and that
is a noisy, furfeiting, troublesome Bluster of
his Wealth, and of his great Wisdom and
good Judgment in gaining it; this we call,
and justly too, being <HI>Purse-proud;</HI>
and 'tis
the most hateful unsociable Thing belonging
to a Tradesman; and yet 'tis what is very
difficult for him to avoid.</P>
<P>If the Tradesman is risen from nothing to
be an Alderman, to be a Man in Wealth and
Figure, it might suffice him, that the verySta∣tion
of Life he fills up in the Place where he
lives, declares it: His Fur-gown
and Gold
Chain, the antient Geugaws of Corporation
Pageantry, and the grave magisteral Suppor∣ters
of a Tradesman's Pride, might be sufficient
to tell the World he is rich, without his
never-weasing
Tongue being always trum∣peting
out his own Praises, and his own
Wealth.</P>
<P><PB N="228" REF="244"/>
OR, if I was to talk seriously to him, tho'
that's out of Fashion too in the City, as
well as at Court, I would say, he should
satisfy himself with being secretly thankful
to Heaven, for blessing his Diligence, and
not be always boasting to Men, as if his Di∣ligence
was the Merit, and that Heaven was
only just to him, in giving him the due Re∣ward
of it.</P>
<P>BUT a Word about that Part is enough, <HI>as
Times</HI> go; I am now to speak to the sociable
Part of it: How odd does it found in his
Mouth, to have his whole Time, (on all Oc∣casions,
in all Societies, and interrupting all
Conversation,) be taken up with it, all Dis∣course
summ'd up in it, all good Company
entertain'd with it, I might have said dis∣turb'd
with it?</P>
<P>I MUST confess, I think a Purse-proud
Tradesman
one of the most troublesome and
intollerable of all God's two legg'd Crea∣tures;
and this as well before he has left off
Trade, as afterwards.</P>
<P>BEFORE he has left off, he is so to his
Neighbours and <HI>Fellow∣radesmen;</HI>
after he
has left off he is the like <HI>among Gentlemen:</HI>
As to the Tradesman, he insults every one
of them in their Turn, Poor as well as Rich:
He lessens the latter, and perfectly tramples
upon the former: He attacks the rich Trades∣man
with all possible Railery, tells you he
has thriven a little by Accident or Necessity;
<PB N="229" REF="245"/>
that he may perhaps have gotten a little
Money, but nothing like what the World
talks of: That had he been left in such a Bu∣siness,
he would have made twenty Times as
much of it by that Time: The other, says he,
was left with a good Stock, and a good Trade,
but has been so far from bettering it in his
Hands, that he has not half the Trade his indus∣trious
Father had: Whereas I, <HI>says the Rho∣domontading
bloated Creature,</HI> began without
any of those Advantages; I hammer'd out
a Trade by my own Industry, by the Force
of an invincible Application, and by my
Judgment in Business: If he had begun
without such Helps as he had to introduce
him, he would have been a Beggar and a
Bankrupt long ago; and then he adds, grin∣ning,
who knows what may happen yet?
whereas I hewed my Way through Rocks
and Mountains.</P>
<P>THEN he goes on upon another Point:
He has fool'd away good Part of what he
got, says the blustring Creature, by trusting
out his Stock hand-over-head, to he knew
not who; taking no Care to be well inform'd
of the Characters of Men, and whether they
were fit to be trusted, or no; and there, adds
he, with a Snear, he fool'd away 500 <HI>l.</HI> by
trusting <HI>G</HI>—<HI>S</HI>—, a Fellow I would not
have trusted with 500 <HI>s.</HI> Alas! I saw by the
Way of his trading, and the Manner of his
going on, that he would not hold it; I knew
<PB N="230" REF="246"/>
he would break at last; I always believed
so, and always said so.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> That might be true, indeed, be∣cause
he generally said so of every Bo∣dy,
as is customary; for when any Man
fails in Trade, 'tis usual for such Peo∣ple
to pretend, they knew and expect∣ed
it long before, tho' perhaps all the
rest of the Town was surpriz'd at it,
and thought the Person a rich and safe
Man to deal with.</Q>
<P>THEN he runs on again upon the Folly
and Madness of the rich Tradesman's trust∣ing
out his Effects, and hazarding his Estate,
by unwarily giving great Credit to such and
such People, by which he has had great Los∣ses,
such as, for ought he knows, may be fatal
to him at last. But I, <HI>continues he,</HI> (with a
Gravity suitable to his Pride,) have always
acted by other Rules, I have taken other
Measures; if I had not I had not been where
I am; I had been still labouring in the Fire,
and working to get Money honestly, for
Fools to run away with knavishly.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> This Discourse is upon a Sup∣position,
that a Man may always judge
of the Bottom and Substance of every
Tradesman that he deals with, than
which nothing is more untrue; and that
<PB N="231" REF="247"/>
we see the most flourishing Tradesmen,
those who we thought to be like Pil∣lars
of the <HI>Exchange,</HI> sink and fall in∣to
Misfortune and Misery, as I have said
but just before; and nothing is more as∣suming,
than for a Man to say, he can
always judge of the Substance of a
Tradesman by his Outside, and, in short,
may know who is fit to be trusted, and
who not.</Q>
<P>THUS far we take the Purse-proud
Trades∣man's
Blustering among his Fellow Trades∣men,
and vaunting of his own Prudence
and Condition; his Wisdom in judging who
to deal with, and who not; who were fit to
be trusted, and who not; and what Trades∣men
were likely to stand, and what to fall;
when at the same Time the wisest and most
wary Men in Trade in the World are often
deceiv'd in that very one Point, which I take
to be one of the most important Difficulties
of Trade.</P>
<P>BY this Prudence it is he boasts, that he
has always avoided Losses, has forborn to
trust those Men, who have afterwards fail'd;
that by this he has preserved himself and his
Fortune, when others have sunk by their Un∣wariness,
and been undone, whereas the
Truth of the Story has been, that he has not
had Stock sufficient to trust them, and so has
<PB N="232" REF="248"/>
not been in a Condition in Trade to lose any
Thing by their Misfortune.</P>
<P>THUS I have known several of those
Purse-proud
Creatures fit peddling in a Shop
twenty to thirty, nay, to forty Years, and not
being able to give Credit, tho' to the best of
Dealers, (for almost all Tradesmen take as
well as give Credit in their Business,) rise
perhaps to be worth a thousand Pound, or
perhaps two, and then boast of their Policy
and Prudence in Trade, their Wariness and
Caution in giving Credit, <HI>and the like;</HI> where∣as
the generous open-hearted
Tradesman,
who they reproach with his Want of Cau∣tion,
tho' he has lost more than the other
ever got, goes on with Courage, and, it may
be, leaves off at last with ten to fifteen to
twenty thousand Pound in his Pocket; having
carried on a vast Trade, given great Credit,
serv'd his Neighbours, been a publick Be∣nefit
to Trade in general, and to all the
People he has dealt with in particular;
which the Purse-proud
Creature, I speak
of, could not pretend to, nor had Room to
expect; and yet he blasts this Conduct with
his vain conceited Tongue, and suggests, that
the more frank and generous Tradesman must
die a Beggar.</P>
<P>THIS insupportable Wretch has always
another Thing attending his ill Tongue,
and that is Envy: As he speaks well of no
Body, so he must envy every Body, espe∣cially
<PB N="233" REF="249"/>
every Body that out∣ives
his Re∣proach;
it cannot be otherwise: He that
thus speaks suspiciously of his thriving
Neighbours, speaks as he wishes it to
be; he has an Exception to every Man's
Fame and Character, be it ever so good;
and the better it is, the more he is piqu'd
at it: This is the natural Product of an en∣vious
Spirit; he insinuates, that they will
miscarry, because he secretly desires they
should do so. Again, Envy is of a Na∣ture
so agreeing with that of the dreadful
Pit from whence it came, and so tinctur'd
from <HI>Satan,</HI> in whom, <HI>if we may believe
the Learned,</HI> it was the original Crime, and
laid the Foundation of his first Rebellion,
that, like him, it falls always upon the best
Objects: The brightest Character is the
Mark at which Envy is certain to shoot all
its poison'd Darts; and as it is so in Cases
of a higher Nature, 'tis so in its Degree in
this.</P>
<P>THE Man I am speaking of is first a
poor, empty, bloated-up
Animal, who ri∣sing
from nothing, or something very mean,
and having been lifted up beyond what he
was, continues always lifted beyond what
he is: He is so, and will be so, because,
though his Stock of Money may encrease,
yet his Stock of Pride encreases still faster
than his Wealth; and as he knows that
tho' he is tolerably well, yet he is not all
<PB N="234" REF="250"/>
he pretends to be; so he cannot patiently
bear that others should rise beyond what he
knows himself to be.</P>
<P>THIS swells his Envy; for as Pride is the
first Vice in the Soul, so Envy is the first∣born
Product of Pride, and 'tis a true natu∣ral
Child, the Image of its Parent: In a
word, to drive at Things above ourselves
is Pride; to hate all that out-go
us, and
rise too fast for us, is Envy; and to slan∣der
all we hate, is the Product of both;
'tis the Fruit by which the Tree is known.</P>
<P>WHY is the Man's Mouth always full of
Evil, but because his Heart is always full of
Envy? And whence comes his Envy, but from
his Pride? Because the Man exceeds him or
excels him, the first in Wealth, the last in
Merit, either of them whets his Anger,
and he runs on railing; for 'tis said justly
of Envy, it goes always with its Mouth
open.</P>
<P>BUT to leave the Causes, and go on with
the Facts; for 'tis this gives the Offence,
and makes the Man so troublesome to all
about him: Could his Picture be drawn,
you would see him like a Ballad-singer,
always
with a Crowd about him; but they
are of such a kind, as no Man need be vain
of, and none but such a Man could; for
wise Men shun him as they would an In∣fection;
he persecutes them, indeed, with
his Noise; but any By-stander
might see,
<PB N="235" REF="251"/>
though himself cannot, that they are sick
of him; that his Noise surfeits them; that
his Song, being always to one Tune, has no
Musick in it; and that they avoid him as
much as possible.</P>
<P>INDEED, my Business is not to write Cha∣racters
here, but to warn the Compleat
Tradesman, to whom I all along direct my
Discourse, to avoid the hateful Character;
and as I would have him act in another
Manner, so I would have him act from other
Principles: The Truth is, to infuse Princi∣ples
of Modesty, Prudence, Diligence, and
Virtue, into a young Tradesman, is to se∣cure
him from acting in such a Manner as
this: He that rises by Steps of Wisdom and
Prudence, will stand upon the same Bottom,
will go on to act by the same Rules, and
not run into the Vices of Trade, when he
has thriven by the Virtue of it.</P>
<P>HE that gets an Estate by Honesty, will
enjoy it with Modesty: To boast of his
own Wisdom in the amasing his Money,
and insult the Senses and Understanding of
every Man that has miscarried, is not only
a Token of Immodesty, but, if that were
of any Force with this Age, I should say,
'tis the infallible Mark of Irreligion; 'tis
sacrificing to his own Net, and to his own
Drag, to his own Head, and to his own
Hands: 'Tis not a Pharisee, indeed; for he
went up to the Temple with, <HI>God, I thank
<PB N="236" REF="252"/>
thee,</HI> in his Mouth; he boasted, indeed, of
more Holiness than he had, as this Man
often does of more Money than he has:
But the Pharisee out-did
him there, that he
acknowledg'd it to his Maker, that he was
so good and so righteous, and not like the
Publican: But this Man forgetting to look
up, or to look in, as he might do, looks
only upon the Outside of his Affairs, as
<HI>Nebuchaduezzar</HI> did upon the City of <HI>Ba∣bylon,</HI>
Dan. iv. 30. <HI>Is not this great</HI> BABEL,
<HI>that I have built for the House of my
King, done by the Might of</HI> my Power, <HI>and
for the Honour of</HI> my Majesty; and what
follows in the very next Line, a Voice came
from Heaven, thus: <HI>O</HI> KING, <HI>to thee is it
spoken, they shall drive thee</HI> from Men,
<HI>and thy Dwelling shall be</HI> with the Beasts,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I confess the <HI>Simile</HI> is too high for the
Beast I am speaking of, infinitely too high;
but it is so suitable to him in all the Parts,
as well as in the End, that nothing can more
justly, or more aptly match with him; he
is really fit to be driven <HI>from among Men,</HI>
and to dwell with the Beasts of the Field;
for he is too tiresome to live among his
Neighbours.</P>
<P>I would calmly caution my young Trades∣man,
who aims at the Title I am prepa∣ring
him for, <HI>viz.</HI> to be Compleat, to shun
every Thing that has the least Tendency
<PB N="237" REF="253"/>
to this Evil, this trading Vice, as a Thing
that will at last rob him of all the true
Enjoyment of his Prosperity when it comes.</P>
<P>A Tradesman has Hazards enough of
thriving at all, and Fears and Anxieties
enough all the Way he goes; and 'tis great
Pity, that when he has thriven he should
not enjoy it with Satisfaction to himself,
and with the Kindness, Esteem, and Affec∣tion
of his Neighbours: A wise, sober,
modest Tradesman, when he is thriven, and
grown rich, is really a valuable Man, and
he is valued on all Occasions: As he went
on with every Body's good Wishes when
he was getting it, so he has every Body's
Blessing and good Word when he has
got it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, if he retains the Character when
he is out of Business, which he deserved
and gain'd when he was in Business, he is a
publick Good in the Place where he lives; as
he was useful to himself before, he is useful
to every Body else after: Such a Man has
more Opportunity of doing good than al∣most
any other Person I can name: He is
useful a thousand Ways, and many of them,
such as Men of ten Times his Learning
and Education and Capacities in other
Things are able to be.</P>
<P>HE is in the first Place a kind of a natu∣ral
Magistrate in the Town where he lives;
and all the little Causes, which in Matters
<PB N="238" REF="254"/>
of Trade are innumerable, and which often,
for want of such a Judge, go on to Suits
at Law, and so ruin the People concern'd
in them by the Expence, the Delay, the
Wounds in Substance, and the Wounds in
Reputation, which they often bring with
them: I say, all these Causes are brought
before him; and he not only hears and de∣termines
them, but in many of them his
Determination shall be as effectual among
the contending Tradesmen, and his Vote as
decisive, as any Lord Chancellor in the
Kingdom.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, he is the general Peace∣Maker
of the Country, the common Arbi∣trator
of all trading Differences, Family
Breaches, private Injuries; and in general,
he is the Domestick Judge, in Trade espe∣cially;
and by this he gains a general Re∣spect,
an universal Kind of Reverence in
all the Families about him, nay, he has the
Blessings and Prayers of Poor and Rich.</P>
<P>AGAIN, he is the Trade-counsellor
of
the Country where he lives: It must be con∣fess'd,
in Matters of Commerce, Lawyers
make but very poor Work, when they come
to be consulted about the little Disputes
which continually happen among Trades∣men,
and are so far from setting Things to
Rights, that they generally, by their Igno∣rance
in the Usage and Customs of Trade,
make Breaches wider, rather than closing
<PB N="239" REF="255"/>
them, and leave Things worse than they
find them.</P>
<P>NOT that I have any Regard in this Part
to the general Scandal which lies upon the
Country Lawyers, (ay, and Town Lawyers
too,) <HI>viz.</HI> of setting People together by
the Ears, in order to reconcile them; that
is to say, to widen Breaches, in order to
heal them their own Way; but it too often
happens so, whether they intend it so, or no;
and I cannot say they have the Reproach
of it without Cause; whether it happens
through Ignorance or Design, is not to my
present Purpose; nor am I to make this
Work go out of its Way, to write Satyr
upon Professions of any kind.</P>
<P>BUT let the Lawyers act how they will,
and go to—their own Way in general:
The Case here is Fact, in the Particular,
that as among Counsellors one is a good
Chancery Man, another a good City Coun∣sel,
another is practis'd in one Court, and
at one Bar, another at the other Bar; one
is a Chamber-counsel,
another a Convey∣ancer,
another a Pleader; so the old, ap∣prov'd,
experienced Tradesman, that has
the Reputation of an honest Man, has left
off Business, and gone out of Trade with
a good Reputation for Judgment, Integrity,
and Modesty, he is the Oracle for Trade,
every one goes to him for Advice, refers to
<PB N="240" REF="256"/>
his Opinion, and consults with him in diffi∣cult
and intricate Cases.</P>
<P>AND to crown all, he is the Trade∣Chan∣cellor
of the whole Place: Differences are
adjusted, Enemies reconcil'd, equitable Que∣stions
resolv'd by him: He is not the Arbi∣ter,
but the Umpire; he is the last Resort;
even when Arbitrators cannot make it up,
he is chosen to arbitrate between the Arbi∣trators:
As the <HI>Romans</HI> had two Consuls,
which were their Leaders in Time of War,
and their Guides in Time of Peace; Gene∣rals
in the Field, and Judges in the Town;
so they had their <HI>Dictator,</HI> who was Su∣perior
to the Consuls, who had the ultimate
Authority that the Commonwealth could
give; they were every Thing, and every
where; had the Power of Life and Death
in their absolute Determination; the Dicta∣tor
was Lord Chancellor in the State, and
Generalissimo in the Camp.</P>
<P>SO this happy Tradesman is the Sum of all
the Application of the other Tradesmen near
him, or that know him; he not only adjusts
Differences before they come to a Height, and
so prevents the People going to Law, saves
them from the Expence of their Money,
and the wasting Extravagances of violent,
and perhaps malicious Prosecutions, but
makes Men Friends, when they are, as it were,
just beginning to be Enemies; and before
the Breaches are come to a Head, he stops
<PB N="241" REF="257"/>
the Erruption; Like the Moderator, he calms
the Passions of the Furious, checks the Con∣tentious;
and finding out the healing Medium
which satissies both Sides, brings them to
yield to one another, and so does Justice to
both.</P>
<P>THUS he is, in a word, a kind of a common
Peace-maker;
and as we call the eldest Al∣derman
the Father of the City, so he is, in a
kind, the Father of the trading World in the
Orb or Circle where he moves in; his Pre∣sence
has a kind of a Peace-taking
Aspect in
it, and he is as necessary as a Magistrate, whe∣ther
he is in Office, or not, nay, he is a thou∣sand
Times more useful than some good-for-nothing
Mayors and Aldermen, when not
attended with valuable and suitable Qua∣lities:
And this brings me back to the poor
empty rattling Purse-proud
Body I was speak∣ing
of before.</P>
<P>LET my young Tradesman but fix his
Eye upon such an one; I doubt he needs not
go far to seek him; there are few Cities, or
Corporations, or Courts of Aldermen, but
have some Time or other the Misfortune to
be troubled with them: Let him, I say, mark
the Man, see how he behaves, hark how
he rings out his own Character, how he
dwells upon his own extraordinary Self on
every Occasion; and with what a Storm of
Impertinence he breaks out, in the greatest
<PB N="242" REF="258"/>
and best Company, and let him ask himself,
if the Pattern be worth his Imitation?</P>
<P>FROM him let the Observer turn to his
wiser Neighbours, and see how the bluster∣ing
Creature is accepted; how all the Com∣pany
are surfeited with him, and sick of
him; how they turn from him when he is
present, and laugh at him when he is ab∣sent;
how he is the common Burthen of So∣ciety,
and how diligently the best Men a∣void
him.</P>
<P>LET him hear the Opinion of the most
Judicious, concerning this Man's Conduct;
his Way in Company, or out of it, in his
Business, or out of his Business; and not∣withstanding
his having gotten some Money,
let the Tradesman judge from the whole,
whether that Conduct is to be imitated; whe∣ther
you would be pleas'd with such a Cha∣racter;
with being so receiv'd among wise
Men; and with having so visibly, so uni∣versally
the Contempt of all Men cast upon
you, in Company, or out of Company; and
as you can upon sedate Thoughts be plea∣sed
with it, or displeas'd, so make your
own Conduct agree with it or disagree with
it.</P>
<P>I have upon many Occasions spoken in
this Work to the Tradesman I am talking
to, of a certain Thing called Reputation:
The Word indeed in Trade has a particular
<PB N="243" REF="259"/>
Import, and signisies a Man of Substance, a
Man of Credit, fit to be trusted, or as it is
more ordinarily express'd, an able Man: Also
there is a Thing called Honesty, which is
understood too in the general Article of Re∣putation:
To say a Man is a Knave, or to
reflect upon him as not an honest Man, is
to wound his Reputation; so that Reputa∣tion
there, is of a particular Signification:
But there is a Reputation too which relates
to the personal Conduct and Capacities of a
Man; as such a Man has the Reputation of
being a Man of Sense, the Reputation of
a Man of Parts and Understanding, or the
Reputation of a Man of Virtue and Modes∣ty,
and the like. If you reproach a Man
with ill Manners, or ill Morals, (the last espe∣cially,)
he takes it very ill, and says you in∣jure
his Reputation.</P>
<P>IT is every Way to my Purpose here;
if my young Tradesman is to be suppos'd to
aim at his true Interest, he will observe, that
to be careful of his Reputation in all these, is
as essential to him, as that of his Credit in
Payments, and that to be esteemed a Man of
Understanding, of Sense, Modesty, and Vir∣tue,
is as well worth his Concern, as 'tis to
be esteem'd a Man of Subftance.</P>
<P>THE laft indeed is useful in the Begin∣ning
of his Business, and the first in his lea∣ving
it off; the last makes him come in with
<PB N="244" REF="260"/>
Reputation, and the first makes him go out
with Reputation; with this Difference too in
the Kinds, <HI>viz.</HI> that the Reputation, which
we call Credit, is temporary, 'tis wanting
and needful only for a little while, that is to
say, so long as he wants to be trusted, so long
as he is drudging through the World, and
working for an Estate; but when he has
thriven, and got it, that Reputation is use∣less,
and at an End.</P>
<P>BUT the Reputation of his Capacities,
Sense, and Understanding, and especially
that which indeed is ordinarily attendant up∣on
them, namely, his Virtue and Modesty;
these are valuable from his Beginning to his
End, and that not to the End of his Trade only,
but of his Life; not only when he was poor,
but when he is rich, and rather more at last
than at first.</P>
<P>NOR can he ever say it is of no Use to
him, to be thought a wise and understand∣ing,
a modest and good Man; he always
stands in Need of it: This is the Life of
his Character <HI>at last,</HI> as well as <HI>at first:</HI>
This is the good Name, which the wise Man
says is <HI>better than Life,</HI> which a good
Man had rather die than part with, and cea∣ses
to be a good Man when he loses it, espe∣cially
if he justly forfeits it.</P>
<P>A Tradesman grown rich and above the
World, tells you he wants no Credit, he
<PB N="245" REF="261"/>
does not value Credit, because he asks no
Man to trust him. But no Tradesman, at
least no wise Man, will say so of his Repu∣tation;
for every Man, Tradesmen or others,
desires to deserve the Name of an honest Man,
and of a Man of Sense and Virtue; and
a Tradesman leaving off his Business ought
to regard it much more, than even the same
Tradesman in the Hurry of his Trade; not
that an honest Man should not always pre∣serve
his Character as a Man of Honesty;
but it may be more remarkably necessary at
one Time than another, at least, it is of more
Use at one Time than another. <HI>For Ex∣ample;</HI></P>
<P>THE
Character of a Tradesman, for a
Man of Sense and Understanding, is more
particularly of Use to him, when he comes
to leave off, and settle among his Neighbours
as a Man of Years, than at any Time be∣fore;
and that on many Accounts: Of what
Use is he to the World, or to himself, if he
is not also a Man of some Weight in this
particular Article of his Understanding?
Of what Use to himself? of what Value
to those about him? Of what Weight is an
OLD FOOL in a Parish, or in a Town?
What Good does a poor shallow, noisy, Purse∣proud
Tradesman do in his Generation, to
himself, or to any Body else? A weak-head∣ed
empty Tradesman out of Business, and
<PB N="246" REF="262"/>
left capable to do nothing, and say nothing,
what is he? what but a poor unactive
Thing, that rises in the Morning to go to
Bed at Night? waits a little Time just to
drop into the Grave, and be forgotten? No
body wants him while he lives, or miss him
when he dies: If any Thing of Conse∣quence
is felt from him, it is the Ease that
his Neighbours obtain at their Clubs and So∣cieties,
and in their ordinary Conversation,
by being delivered from his Noise, and
being no more tired and disordered by the
discording unsonorous Clamour of his
Tongue, always ringing Changes upon the
hateful Subject of his own Praises, and his
mighty Wealth, gotten by his exorbitant Di∣ligence,
and his inimitable Application.</P>
<P>BUT to have done with him as fast as we
can, I must take a little Notice of him when
he is out of his Element, as well as in it; and
then I shall do, as it ought to be done with
him, turn him out of the Company. I have
mentioned his Behaviour and Reception a∣mong
his Fellow-Tradesmen,
his Brethren
of the <HI>Counter</HI> and the <HI>Compting-House,</HI>
the
Men of Trade and Business, his Neigh∣bours,
and Equals.</P>
<P>IF they are sick of him, if they are gor∣ged
with his Rattling and Noise, how is it
when he comes among Gentlemen? when
sallying out from his Sphere, in which Na∣ture
<PB N="247" REF="263"/>
circumscrib'd him, and for which alone
he was fitted, (if fit for any Thing,) he comes
out, and calls himself <HI>a Gentleman?</HI> What
Figure does he make among them? What
Reception do they give him? The late King
<HI>Charles</HI> II. of merry Memory, the best hu∣mour'd
Man (whatever he was for a King)
that ever till then wore the Character of
<HI>Royal,</HI> usually had that Expression, that he
<HI>could make a Knight,</HI> but he <HI>could not make
a</HI> GENTLEMAN; <HI>Ex quo vis Ligno non fit
Mercurio.</HI> If it was a Work too hard for a
King, how should the clownish Impertinent
that I am speaking of do it? Nay, how
should he be the Agent upon himself, me∣tamorphise
himself, and turn himself, not
<HI>inside out,</HI> for that he does every Day, but
turn himself <HI>outside in,</HI> from a conceited
Purse-proud
Shop-Keeper
turn himself into
a Gentleman? Much easier might he get an
<HI>Actaeon</HI> set upon his Shoulders, than a Stock
of Brains put into his Head, <HI>Modesty</HI> upon
his Face, or <HI>Manners</HI> upon his Behaviour.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>be that as it will,</HI> there's no Remedy,
he will call himself a <HI>Gentleman,</HI> and will
thrust himself into the Company of such,
that he may at least be thought so by others:
But what Pen can describe, what Tongue ex∣press
the nauseous, offensive, contemptible
Appearance, which he makes there? How
do the Gentlemen commiserate their own
<PB N="248" REF="264"/>
Condition, when he comes in? Who can
conceive the general Disorder it puts them
into? How they look upon and condole with
one another, for spoiling their Company,
and marring their Mirth with the unsuitable
Society of a Scoundrel? how they consult in
what Manner to be best rid of him? and
how they wish for a Law to establish the
just sorting Mankind, and ranging them in∣to
Classes, as the rest of God's Creatures are,
where among the very Beasts and Fowls,
they associate in Kinds, and <HI>Birds of a Fea∣ther
flock together?</HI></P>
<P>STRANGE that the sensitive Life should
enjoy a better Regimen than the Rational:
We don't see the Sheep herd with the Dogs,
especially with <HI>Mungrels,</HI> or the Deer with
the Hounds; the generous Horse hates to
graze with the long-ear'd
abject Ass; and the
majestick Lyon abhors to sociate with that
Emblem of a Churl, the <HI>Bear.</HI></P>
<P>BUT among Men, where the Difference is
infinitely greater, the sordid teizing Mecha∣nick,
trusted by Heaven with a little more
Money than his Neighbours, borrows the
Feathers of the Gay, the Polite, the Manly,
and the Mannerly; and in spite of Nature,
and his Want of Brains, claims not to pass
for what he is, but for what he neither is,
or is capable to be.</P>
<P><PB N="249" REF="265"/>
IF suitable Society is a heavenly Life,
Heaven guard us all from that evident
Plague of Nature, that State of Life which
is the immediately contrary to all human Fe∣licity,
<HI>viz.</HI> being unequally match'd: Con∣versation
is certainly the Glory of a Man,
and particularly of a <HI>Gentleman;</HI> but to
mix the Boor and the Gentleman, especially
the Man of Letters and the Stupid, the
Man of Manners and the Clown; to sort
the noisy unbred Piece of dead Life, who
suits with nothing but the Shop and the
Apron, with the Men of Sense and Edu∣cation;
what is this, but setting up a Chand∣ler's
Shop in <HI>Whitehall,</HI> as if the Vice-Chancellor
of <HI>Oxford</HI> should appoint a Box∣ing-Match
in the Theatre, and set up a
Wrestling-Ring in the College-Gardens,
that the Rabble should dispute with the
Students at Cudgels, and instead of Logick
and Syllogisms, they should every one
play three Hits at Backsword with the But∣chers?</P>
<P>WHAT is this less than that? What is
an impertinent Purse-proud Shop-Keeper
among a Society of Gentlemen, but linking
the Inns of Court and the Bear-Garden,
and condemning the Well-bred, the Polite,
the Wife, and the Sensible, to be baited at
a Stake, not by Dogs, but much worse, by
the Man-Brute, a kind of a Creature worse
<PB N="250" REF="266"/>
than the Tarantula, that talks them to
Death, stifles them with Nonsense; and if
they escape, 'tis like a Man that just gets
out of a Crowd, and pants for Breath, be∣ing,
with the utmost Difficulty, escaped
from being squeez'd flat with the Weight of
his Fellow-Creatures,
and press'd to Death
among the Rabble.</P>
<P>I remember a Case which to me serves for
a just Emblem of this Calamity of Man∣kind;
and with this I shall dismiss the Sub∣ject.</P>
<P>EVERY Body knows, remembers, or has
heard of the Story of the late King <HI>James</HI> II.
who endeavouring to go off from <HI>Rochester</HI>
to <HI>France</HI> in a small Vessel, was stopp'd at the
Mouth of the <HI>East-Swale</HI>
of <HI>Medway,</HI> and
being rudely seiz'd by the Crew of a Fish∣ing-Smack,
was brought up in a barbarous
Triumph to <HI>Feversham.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN his Majesty was there, though he
was taken out of the Hands of those dirty
Fellows that first seiz'd him, and used him
as I care not to remember; he found him∣self
in the Hands of a yet more dangerous
Sort of People, the Rabble, who, upon the
Noise of the King's being taken, as they
call'd it, throng'd from all Parts of the
Country to <HI>Feversham;</HI> so that the King
found himself surrounded, as it were, with
an Army of Furies, the whole Street, which
<PB N="251" REF="267"/>
is very wide and large, being fill'd, and
Thousands of the noisy Gentry got toge∣ther,
for they knew not what, and, not un∣likely,
to do they knew not what.</P>
<P>HIS Majesty, who knew well enough the
Temper of the People at that Time, but
not what they might be push'd upon to do
at such a Juncture, when the whole Nation
was in a Ferment, was very uneasy, as well
he might, and spoke to some of the Gen∣tlemen,
who came with more Respect, and
more like themselves to the Town upon
that surprising Occasion: The King told
them he was in their Hands, and was con∣tent
to be so, and they might do what they
would with him; but whatever they thought
fit to do with him, he desired they would
quiet the People, and not let him be de∣liver'd
up to the Rabble to be torn to
Pieces.</P>
<P>THE Gentlemen told his Majesty they
were sorry to see him used so ill, and they
would do any thing that was in their Power
to protect him; but that it was not possible
for them to quel the Tumult of the People;
they should rather be in Danger, of being
torn to Pieces for Papists, and the like.</P>
<P>THE King distress'd to the last Degree
with the Insults of the Street; the People
shouting, and hollowing, and pressing to
have the Door open'd in a really frightful
<PB N="252" REF="268"/>
Manner; At length, his Majesty observing
a mighty busy forward Gentleman (as he
seemed to be) among the Crowd, who run
about from one Party to another, hollow∣ing,
and animating the People, heading the
Mob, and, as it were, leading them on to
a Charge, shaking his Hat, and calling to
the People to hollow, and the like, accord∣ing
to the Street-Usage
in other Cases; the
King sent a Gentleman to him to bring him
in, and tell him his Majesty desir'd to speak
with him.</P>
<P>THE Message was deliver'd with all pos∣sible
Civility, and the little <HI>Massinello</HI> was
prevail'd with to come up Stairs: The King
receiv'd him with a Courtesy rather equal
to his present Circumstances than to his
Dignity, and began to argue with him; told
him what he was doing might have an Event
worse than he intended; that he seemed to
be Heating the People up for some Mis∣chief,
which perhaps he did not foresee;
and that as he had done him no immediate
personal Wrong, why should he attack
him in this Manner; that he was in their
Hands, and they might do what they pleas'd
with him; but he hop'd they did not design
to murder him.</P>
<P>THE Fellow stood, as it were, Thunder∣struck
with the Awe of Majesty, and said
not one Word; but the King went on speak∣ing
<PB N="253" REF="269"/>
to him, and told him, he found he had
some Influence on the Rabble, and desir'd
him that he would pacify them, and quiet
them; that Messengers were gone to <HI>London,</HI>
to the Parliament at <HI>London;</HI> and that he
desir'd only they would be quiet till they
return'd.</P>
<P>THE King knew nothing of the Man,
what he was, or who he was; perhaps if
he had, he would not have spent so much
Pains upon him, much less did his Majesty
know that it was a Purse-proud Country
Shop-Keeper; but that by-the-by, the Sto∣ry's
very short.</P>
<P>WHAT the Fellow answer'd to the King
I know not; but as I immediately enquir'd,
they told me he did not say much but this;
<HI>What can I do with them? and what would
you have me do with them?</HI> but as soon as
the King had done speaking to him, he
turn'd short, and made to the Door as fast
as he could, to go out of the Room.</P>
<P>UPON that, one of the Gentlemen spoke
to him to the same Purpose, <HI>very civilly,</HI> and
began to use some Argument with him: He
answered him, like a true Churl, with Inso∣lence,
and to the last Degree rude, like himself,
<HI>Don't talk to me,</HI> says he, <HI>about it; what can
I do?</HI> and so goes on to the Stairs. As soon as
he was got fairly to the Stair-Head,
and
saw his Way open, he turns short about to
the Gentlemen, and raising his Voice so
<PB N="254" REF="270"/>
that the King, who was but in the next
Room, should be sure to hear him, says he,
<HI>I have a Bag of Money as long as my Arm,</HI>
HOLLOW, <HI>Boys,</HI> HOLLOW.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> THE King was so filled with Con∣tempt
and just Indignation, at the mean
low-spirited Insolence of the <HI>Purse∣proud</HI>
Wretch, that it quite took off the
Horror of the Rabble, which was too
much upon his Mind before, and
his Majesty only <HI>sinil'd,</HI> and sat
down, and said, <HI>Let them alone, let
them do their worst.</HI> But that by the
Way, the Story I know personally to
be true.</Q>
<P>THE Example, I think, serves my Pur∣pose
exactly, and lets you see the true Pic∣ture
of a Purse-proud
Tradesman; for this
Man was a Country <HI>Grocer,</HI> not in <HI>Fe∣versham,</HI>
but in a little Village in the ad∣jacent
Country: After this short History,
I need say no more by way of Character
about it.</P>
<P>BUT I cannot conclude it without giving
my Compleat Tradesman a Caution against
the Temper: To be a rich Tradesman is desi∣rable;
but to be vain of the mere Wealth as
such, is a Token of the greatest Meanness
of Spirit that Mankind is or can be capable
<PB N="255" REF="271"/>
of; 'tis a Baseness of Soul below a rational
Creature; 'tis like a Boar, who is surly and
mischevious only because he is fat; when it
is certain that he is fed up to that ungo∣vernable
Height and Heat of his Blood
only to have his Throat cut, and make the
larger Brawn.</P>
<P>OF all the Mistakes of a Tradesman's
Life, I mean after that of breaking, and
turning Bankrupt is past Danger, this of
being Purse-proud
is the worst, and with the
utmost Diligence to be avoided by the
Tradesmen; 'tis what exposes him most to
the just Scorn and Contempt of the World,
at least of the wiser Part of it, and making
those Men sick of him, that it should be
his Honour to be agreeable to.</P>
<P>NOR is it an exposing him only, but it
is particularly his Disaster, in that, it ex∣poses
him at that Time of his Life when
his Character should be establish'd; when
the Interest he should have among the best
Men should begin, and when what Reputa∣tion
he gains would be sure to stay with
him; when being well received among even
his Superiors, and honour'd among his E∣quals
and Inferiors, he should go with the
utmost Pleasure through the Remainder of
Life, and enjoy all that the World could give,
or the Deity design'd for making a Man of
his Station compleatly happy.</P>
<P><PB N="256" REF="272"/>
IF then the Tradesman would go on in
his Business chearfully, and go out of it
comfortably; if he would be esteemed
when in Trade, and valued and wellaccepted-in
the World, when out of Trade;
if he would be useful to others and to him∣self,
be honoured by the Poor, and be agree∣able
to the wisest and best of Men; if he
would go through the World with Ap∣plause,
and out of it with Satisfaction; ob∣tain
a good Esteem when alive, and leave
a good Report behind him when he is dead;
let him of all the Errors of Life, I mean
respecting Mankind, avoid this as the worst;
as the most scandalous, most offensive, and
most ridiculous Thing he can ever be guil∣ty
of.</P>

<DIV4 N="11" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of a Tradesman being quarrelsome and
litigious, forward to go to Law for eve∣ry
Trifle, and to be always embroil'd with
his Neighbours.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG>F all the Signals of a Purs∣roud
Tradesman,
I know none more in∣fallible
than this, of his being quar∣relsome
and litigious among his Neigh∣bours
<PB N="257" REF="273"/>
and Customers, to catch at every Ad∣vantage,
to wrangle without Reason, quar∣rel
without Provocation, dispute Trifles,
and go to Law without Justice.</P>
<P>IT is usual to say, when we see a Man
fond of going to Law, that he does not know
what to do with his Money; he that will
seek Justice in the Law, ought to be first
very sure he can obtain Justice no other
Way: The Law was not design'd to set Peo∣ple
together by the Ears, but to prevent it:
He that seeks his Remedy by Law, that may
have his Right by Treaty, makes the Law
a Stalking-horse
to his Passions, and is as
much guilty of Violence, as he that takes
his Right by Force.</P>
<P>GOING to Law for a Debt, tho' the Debt
be just, before all due and christian Mea∣fures
are made use of to obtain Right by fair
Means, that is, by peaceable Methods, is ta∣king
your Neighbour by the Throat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
a Thing, tho' not expresly forbidden, yet
left as an Example of ungrateful Fury and
Rage, and a Mark of Infamy left on it, as a
Brand of Heaven's Dislike.</P>
<P>IF we talk of Heaven and our Maker,
we are all Bankrupts, insolvent Debtors, and
unable to pay, no not the lowest Composi∣tion;
and if our great Creditor had not found
out a merciful Method for an imputed Pay∣ment,
we must have all gone to Jail, 'till
we had paid the uttermost Farthing: And
<PB N="258" REF="274"/>
is it for us then to take our Neighbour <HI>by
the Throat?</HI> and with Rage and Fury cry,
pay me what thou owest me? where's the
Gratitude of it to him that forgave the great
Debt? where the Compassion which we had
so much need of ourselves?</P>
<P>BUT if there is such a Brand of Cruelty
and Ingratitude upon our violent exacting,
even our just Due, what then is the Charac∣ter
of him that uses Violence with Injustice
too? Injurious Violence is but a legal Rob∣bery;
for without question, taking, what
we call the Advantages of the Law, may be
as much a Violence as breaking up a House;
and tho' the Letter of the Law may be in
their Favour, yet Conscience, and Justice,
and honest Dealing, would deter a fairdealing
Man from it.</P>
<P>THERE is a Court of Chancery in every
Man's Breast, and every Man is Judge in
that Court, even for himself; whatever it
may be in other Cases, there a Man is al∣low'd
to be Judge in his own Cafe; but the
Reason is plain, as Conscience is Lord Chan∣cellor,
he can't help determining the Cause
impartially within himself; and whether it
be right or wrong on his Side, whether for
him or against him, the secret Judge within
will tell him very faithfully how it stands,
and what ought to be done.</P>
<P>IF he will not liften to what that Judge
says to him, if he will not acknowledge
<PB N="259" REF="275"/>
the Jurisdiction of the Court, and submit to
the Sentence pronounced, that is another
Case quite, he takes that upon himself, and
the Judge of that secret Court of Chan∣cery
will appeal to a higher Bar; as a Man
appeals here from the Lord Chancellor's De∣cree
to the Judgment of the House of Lords;
only with this Difference, that here the
Chancellor appeals against the Client, there
the Client appeals against the Chancellor;
the Judge appeals against the Criminal, not
the Criminal against the Judge.</P>
<P>NOw let the Tradesman I am speaking to,
bring this home to himself: Before he goes
to Law with his Debtor or Dealer, let him
try the Cause in Equity in his own Breast;
let him ask the Opinion of his own Law∣yer,
(I may say Lawgiver,) the Lord Chan∣cellor
of his own Heart, I mean Conscience;
and let him take heed when he has done
so, that he takes the Counsel there given
him.</P>
<P>IT is a high Affront to a Counsellor at
Law, to ask his Advice, and then not fol∣low
it; 'tis like sending for a Physician, and
then refusing his Medicines; and they who
are so us'd, generally think themselves ob∣lig'd
to justify the Advice they gave.</P>
<P>HE that consults his own Conscience, and
then refuses to listen to its Direction; that
declines its Determination, and will not o∣bey
the Dictates of that Impartial Judge,
<PB N="260" REF="276"/>
may expect its Resentment; it will ap∣peal
against him elsewhere, and justify the
Equity of the Sentence even in his Face.</P>
<P>HE that thus acts in Contempt of the just
Sentence within, and will pursue his Rage
and Revenge against another, because he
has the Advantage over him by some Neg∣lect
on one Side, or Disaster on the other,
must expect the Appeal of Conscience in its
Turn, and tho' the oppress'd Debtor may
not obtain Relief, may be made to pay
wrongfully and unjustly, yet the Reward of
the Oppressor is behind, and may be expect∣ed.
Justice may sleep, but will wake:
<Q><L>'T has leaden Wings, but iron Hands to
show,</L>
<L>It will be certain, tho' it may be slow.</L></Q></P>
<P>BUT perhaps this is too grave for the
Times; the quarrelsome Purse-proud
Trades∣man
I speak of, is got into the Law, and he's
above Gospel; he has an Advantage which
the <HI>Devil</HI> has put into his Hands, and he will
make his Market of it; as for going to the
<HI>Devil</HI> for it, let the <HI>Devil</HI> and him alone
to agree about that, give him the Money,
he has no more to say about Conscience, and
the secret Reproof within himself; he can
get over all that his own Way, 'tis sa∣tisfying
his Avarice and Revenge that he
is bent upon: I have him fast, <HI>says he,</HI> and
<PB N="261" REF="277"/>
I'll follow him, I'll warrant you; I'll push him
Home, I'll ruin him; he shall pay me every
Penny, Charges and all, or he shan't stand
at his Shop∣oor.</P>
<P>WELL but says a peaceable Neighbour,
that goes between them, don't be so warm;
it may be you have an Advantage against
the poor Man: He did owe your Father so
much Money indeed, but he declares he paid
him 200 <HI>l.</HI> of it in several Payments, and
his Books make it appear; but two of the
Receipts are lost, he cannot find them; his
Apprentice is gone beyond Sea, who kept
his Cash, and kept the Receipts and other
Papers, and the Receipts are missing; sure
you won't take the Advantage of such a
Thing.</P>
<P>NOT take the Advantage! says he again;
why not take every just Advantage, to ob∣tain
my Right?</P>
<P>AY, but Sir, says the other, you must
needs know that you had the Money.</P>
<P>I KNOW! says the Tradesman; I know
nothing but black and white; if I had the
Money, to be sure he had my Receipt.</P>
<P>WELL, says the Peace-Maker, and so he
had, no doubt; but it is mislaid.</P>
<P>MISLAID! says the K—; don't tell me,
Tradesmen never mislay Receipts, and of
such a Consequence too.</P>
<P>WELL, but Sir, says the Peace-Maker,
will you shew your own Books? What if it
<PB N="262" REF="278"/>
should appear to be enter'd there? No doubt
you keep Books as well as other Men, and if
you have receiv'd the Money—</P>
<P>HERE he interrupts him haughtily, and
raising his Voice says, what d'ye mean by
that? what are my Books to make up his
Accompts? Sure I keep my Books for my
own Use, and he keeps his Books for his
Use.</P>
<P>I don't know Sir, <HI>says the good Peace-Maker,</HI>
what you may keep your Books for;
but an honest Man will never refuse to shew
his Books in such a Case as this.</P>
<P>WELL, well, I am as honest as he: He
pretends to say, he has paid this 200 <HI>l.</HI> but
has nothing to shew for it: What must I
take his Say∣so
for Payment: I tell you Sir,
I will allow my own Hand to a Receipt, if
he can produce it; if he can't, the Law will
not suppose the Money was ever paid, nor
shall I allow it.</P>
<P>THAT very severe, says the Peace-Maker:
But Sir, adds he, Let me ask one Fa∣vour
of you in behalf of this innocent Suf∣ferer?
You won't shew your Books, you
say, to set it to rights.</P>
<P>NO I wont, Sir, says the Tradesman; he
has nothing to do with my Books.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, replies the other, Grant me
one Thing, however, about your Books.</P>
<P>WHAT that, pray?</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="279"/>
Why shew 'em your self; look into them
fairly, and see whether this Money does not
appear fairly enter'd there at such and such a
Time.</P>
<P>AND what then? what would you make
of that? says the Tradesman, jeering.</P>
<P>NOTHING Sir, nothing, says the Peace-Maker;
only look in them, promise me
that.</P>
<P>I NEED not promise you that, says the
Tradesman, I look in my Books every Day.</P>
<P>WELL, Sir, I say no more, only look par∣ticularly
into this Man's Account, and I'll
be satisfied with one Thing that will certain∣ly
follow: When you see the Money made
receiv'd in your Cash, only ask your self,
Whether it is honest and fair for you to de∣mand
it again?</P>
<P><HI>Ask my self!</HI> a pretty Story to put off a
Debt; I tell you I ask him for the Money,
and I'll have it too: I am sure enough,
if he has no Receipt, I have had no Pay∣ment.</P>
<P>WELL, do but look in your Books, says the
Peace∣aker,
and see if the Money won't
stare in your Face there: Try the Cause
before your own Conscience; I warrant you
'twill go against you; you'll be cast in that
Court.</P>
<P>NAY, says the Tradesman, if you come
to preach, I have done with you: I'll send
for you when I want a Parson; at present
<PB N="264" REF="280"/>
I have no Occasion; Im not sick Sir: I
ha'n't sent for the Doctor yet; and we always
consult the Doctor before the Priest.</P>
<P>WELL Sir, says the Peace-Maker, you may
jest with your Friends, but don't jest with
your self; you may want the Doctor and the
Parson too in due Time: But in the mean
Time, you may want good Advice; and
mine is no bad Counsel, use it as you will.</P>
<P>AY, ay, I'll use it as I will, says the
Tradesman; in the mean Time I want my
Money, and my Money I'll have, or I
know my Way, I'll take my Course for
it.</P>
<P>NO Sir, says the Peace-Maker, you
don't want your Money, you want his Mo∣ney;
it is not yours; I am fully satissied you
have had yours already.</P>
<Q><P>UPON this they parted; the Tradesman
sued the poor Man for the 200<HI>l.</HI> and got
a Verdict against him; but the poor
Debtor brought his Bill in Chancery,
and made such Circumstances appear,
as that the Chancellor granted him an
Injunction against Proceedings, till
Time might be had to send over to
his Apprentice, who was gone to <HI>New
England,</HI> to know of him what he
could say to it.</P>
<P>UPON the Return to this Letter, the
young Man, who was then for him∣self,
<PB N="265" REF="281"/>
recollected the Thing, and sent
over an Affidavit before proper Per∣sons,
and attested in Form by a Notary
Publick, that he paid the Money, and
nam'd several Circumstances too which
much confirm'd it.</P>
<P>BUT with the rest he sent over Direc∣tions
to search among some Papers
which he had left with his other Goods
at a Relation's House in <HI>London,</HI> inti∣mating,
that he believed the Receipts
would be found there.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, upon searching the Pa∣pers,
there were the two Receipts found
under the Tradesman's own Hand; up∣on
producing which the unjust Trades∣man
was fairly, but (to him) shamefully,
cast, and decreed to pay the Charges
of Suit, as well in Chancery as in Com∣mon
Law, and other Damages also,
to no less a Sum altogether, than be∣tween
thirty or forty Pound, besides
his own Charges.</P></Q>
<P>I might give many Examples of like
Injustice, whereby Bills, Receipts, or Bonds,
having been lost, or burnt, or destroy'd, the
Money has been lost, and the unjust Plain∣tiff
has made no Scruple of pursuing ea∣gerly
for the Money that had been fairly
paid before; but they are too long for this
Work.</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="282"/>
BUT I come nearer to the Tradesman's
Conscience than this still; and I say, though
the Debt be just, though the Defendant does
not dispute the Payment, but perhaps dis∣putes
some particular Circumstances in the
Demand, some promised Abatement, some
Defect in the Goods, some trifling Objec∣tion;
and perhaps both Sides are litigious,
quarrelsome, Purse-proud
Tradesmen; I
say they both come under the just Reproof,
and they ought rather to yield small Mat∣ters
on one Hand, or perhaps on both
Hands, rather than push at one another
with Violence: If they want Temper, if
they are equally warm, equally opiniated
of being right, let them chuse Peace-Makers,
refer their Disputes to indifferent
and moderate Judges between them, and
make up Trifles by peaceable-minded
Men,
that they may avoid Trouble and Law-Charges.</P>
<P>THIS
is when two litigious, quarrelling,
Purse-proud
Tradesmen meet; when both
are haughty and outrageous, positive and
obstinate: It must be confess'd, when such
do fall out, and fall upon one another, we
are apt to say, that they are well match'd;
that let them fight it out; they have either
of them Money enough, and no body pities
them; let them tire themselves a little, and
when they have both felt the Expence of
it, they will grow cool.</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="283"/>
BUT as I am directing myself to the foo∣lish
rich Tradesman, 'tis not that they should
be foolish. on Purpose to make Sport to
those that are wiser; but it is to shew them
the Folly of it, that they may grow wiser
themselves: I have heard of two Trades∣men
that fell out thus about the Pack-cloth
that
a Parcel of Goods were deliver'd in,
that is to say, sent down into the Country
in: The Country Shop-Keeper
bought such
and such Goods at a Wholesale-draper's
or
Mercer's, or some such Tradesman in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and went home, leaving the Whole∣sale
Man to send the Goods down after
him.</P>
<P>1. THE Warehouse Man accordingly makes
up the Goods in three Bales or Parcels, and
sends them down by the Carrier. Two In∣cidents
happen upon this Occasion.</P>
<P>THEY had made no Capitulation about
what the Goods should be pack'd up in;
but the Wholesale Man taking himself to
be left at Liberty, packs some of the finer
Goods in a Case or Chest, and the rest in
Canvas, and charges seven Shillings for
the Case, and twelve Shillings for the Can∣vas.</P>
<P>2. THEY had neither of them thought of
what Carrier to send them by, there being
two Carriers who carried Goods to the same
Town; one who was the ordinary Carrier
of the Place, and one who only went thro'
<PB N="268" REF="284"/>
the Town to another Town forty Miles be∣yond
it; the latter, it seems, was the Car∣rier
which the Country Tradesman made
use of; but he had not positively directed
his Goods to be sent by him; and the other
being, as is said, the ordinary Carrier of the
Place; the Tradesman in <HI>London</HI> thought he
was the Man, and so deliver'd the Goods
to him.</P>
<P>IN the Journey the Carrier met with a
Disaster; the Weather was exceeding wet;
extraordinary hasty Rains happened, and the
Waters were out, and so high, that going
through a River which was usually passable,
the Water came into the Waggon, and the
Goods, especially those in the Chest, or Case,
were damag'd very much.</P>
<P>THE Country Chap, a rich Purse-proud
Tradesman,
quarrels at both these Articles;
he would not pay for the Case or the Can∣vas
that the Goods were pack'd in; he
bought the Goods, and he expected to have
those Things thrown in, as Paper and Pack∣thread
is thrown into smaller Things, and
Things sold by Retail: At best, he would
return the Chest and the Canvas, but he
would not pay for them.</P>
<P>THEN as to the Carrier: The Goods were
not sent by his Carrier, and he had not or∣dered
them to be sent by the other, and he
would not stand to the Damage that had
<PB N="269" REF="285"/>
happen'd, and so would not receive the
Goods.</P>
<P>HERE was a double Quarrel, and not
very easy to determine which was right, and
which was wrong; in fact, it seemed both
were right, and both were wrong; that is,
the Country Tradesman was right in the
last, and the City Tradesman in the first.</P>
<P>IT matters not to my Purpose to try the
Cause here; but take it which Way you
will, the Consequence was much the same:
They went on, spent a great deal of Money,
even more than the Goods were worth; at
last one of them died; the Executors had
more Wit, and the surviving Tradesman
was out of Breath; and so the Suit ended
to the Damage of both, unspeakably.</P>
<P>NOW were it only thus; were this litigious
Purse-proud
Temper only to happen among
those of the same fort, I confess the Grie∣vance
would be the less: But how often
does the haughty Creature, who has neither
Reason or Compassion to steer his Actions,
but who is hurried on by his Pride and Inso∣lence
only? I say, how often does he vent
his Fire, and let loose his Pride upon the
innocent, quiet, well-meaning
Tradesman,
falling upon him upon every Occasion in
Trade, and quarrelling upon every Occa∣sion
out of Trade, nay, even without Oc∣casion,
and watching and waiting for an
Occasion?</P>
<P><PB N="270" REF="286"/>
ALL this points, indeed, at the scan∣dalous
Creature, describ'd in our last Chap∣ter,
and it is his Due, and much more: But
I would have this Chapter be directed ano∣ther
Way, namely, to the young Trades∣man,
who is coming forward in Business,
thriving, and in a fair Way to be a rich
Tradesman: I would have him be the Man
I aim at, and wish for, <HI>viz.</HI> a Compleat
Tradesman; and he that is so, will care∣fully
avoid the Extreme I am speaking of,
and never be either vain of his good For∣tune,
or quarrelsome and litigious in the
enjoying it.</P>
<P>PRIDE is the Vice of a long Purse; he
that in Business has the Money, and not
the Corruption, is my Compleat Trades∣man;
indeed he alone is the happy Man in
Trade: To see a Tradesman rich and hum∣ble,
is to see one of the stanch Supports of
the Government, and of the whole Nation
in general: No Nation in the World has
more Tradesmen than <HI>England,</HI> or so many
wealthy, rich, and truly honourable Persons
in Trade, or so much Business upon their
Hands: But there are some among them at
the same Time that have the Vices with the
Virtue, the Salt with the Fresh.</P>
<P>TO be Purse-Proud in Trade is the same Vice
in its Sphere, as to be conceited in Wit; only
with this Difference, that the Tradesman
has frequently the Purse that he is proud
<PB N="271" REF="287"/>
of; but the Fop is generally conceited of
the Wit which he has not.</P>
<P>INDEED, sometimes we see a most in∣congruous,
monstrous Piece of trading Fop∣pery,
<HI>viz.</HI> we see a Tradesman Purse-proud,
and not have the Purse neither; the Man
first fancies himself rich, and then indulges
the Vanity of it: Such a Man may be said
to be proud of the Purse without the Mo∣ney.
Of those, I think, I may say, turn∣ing
his Lines a little, as Mr. <HI>Dryden</HI> said
to Poet <HI>Shadwell,</HI> who charg'd him with
being conceited and proud of his Parts; Mr.
<HI>Dryden</HI> seems to grant it, and replies thus:
<Q><L>Our Pride of Wit and Parts may be an Evil,</L>
<L>But to be proud of Nonsense, <HI>that's the Devil.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>TURN the Tables to our Tradesman,
who is Purse-proud and yet poor, and it
will run thus:
<Q><L>Pride of the swelling Bags may be an Evil,</L>
<L>But to be Poor and Purse-proud, that's the
Devil.</L></Q></P>
<P>AND to carry on the Allusion a little
farther: As the conceited <HI>Would-be-Wit</HI> is
generally a Fool, or, to speak sparingly of
him, a weak Man, so it is in Trade; take
the Purse-proud Tradesmen, and generally
speaking, they are not among the bright
<PB N="272" REF="288"/>
Men, not the Compleat Tradesmen: He is
quite another Man; his Conduct is quite
differing; the Compleat Tradesman is a
Man of too much Sense, he understands
himself better; and to bring it directly to
the Case in hand:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. HE understands himself better than to
be continually embarrassing himself in
Suits at Law; falling upon his Fellow∣Tradesmen
with Heat and Passion, ma∣king
Quarrels for the sake of them,
and pursuing Advantages as if he liv'd
by them; 'tis quite out of his Way;
he does not relish Strife.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. HE understands Trade better than to
push every Debtor to Extremity, and
tear Men to Pieces just when he knows
they cannot answer his Demand; when
he knows that by Patience, and a lit∣tle
Forbearance, the Debt may be got
in, that by Violence would be at least
in Danger of being lost.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. HE knows the Value of his Money
better than to throw it away in Prose∣cutions
at Law for Trifles; in which
he knows he that gets the Victory, al∣ways
is a Loser: He works too hard
for his Money, and gets it with too
much Care and Application, to make
<HI>Ducks and Drakes</HI> of it when he has
done, and throw it away in Gratifica∣tion
<PB N="273" REF="289"/>
of his common Resentment: He'll
never go to Law for the Pack-cloth
'till he spends the Parcel, or fell his
Customer for an empty Box.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THERE cannot be a greater Testimony
of the Decay of a Tradesman's Understand∣ing,
or of his real Deficiency of Brains, than
this of his being litigious, and apt to quar∣rel;
taking Advantage of every Man, and
pushing those Advantages, whether just or
unjust, awing and terrifying poor Men to Ex∣tremities
with <HI>going to Law,</HI> for even Disre∣spect;
making Men Offenders for Words,
and threatning them with Bags of Money,
their Hundreds and Thousands.</P>
<P>AS nothing but a Man of bad Parts, or
bad Principles can delight in making him∣self
Terror and Plague to the Country
round him, so he has the Reward of it;
he is sure to be first hated, then shunn'd,
and at last despis'd; when first they
fear him, they naturally hate him: But
when the Fear abates, and they see him,
like the Devil, not so terrible or so black as
he is painted, they learn to scorn and de∣spise
him.</P>
<P>NOR is this Temper any easier to them∣selves
than it is to their Neighbours; for they
are every Day impoverishing themselves to
carry on the litigious Practice; constant Law-Suits,
and constant Charges eat them up; and
<PB N="274" REF="290"/>
tho' they get the better, they are Losers by
the Quarrels they raise.</P>
<P>I knew a Tradesman that, generally
speaking, had these Kinds of Broils always
upon his Hands; and he was the most un∣easy
Man alive: He was always alaying
Lawyers
Bills, always reading over Bills in
Chancery exhibited against him; for 'twas
observ'd he was always Plaintiff at common
Law, and Defendant in Chancery; that is
to say, that he pursued his Neighbours first
upon every flight Advantage, and they al∣ways
sought Relief in Equity, and gene∣rally
had it too; for he was most injurious
in his first Pretensions; and he that is so, will
always have the worst of it in Equity,
whatever he may have at Common Law.</P>
<P>THIS good-humour'd
Citizen, I believe,
spent for some Years before he left off, 200<HI>l.</HI>
a Year in Law∣uits,
and oftentimes he
paid both Plaintiff's and Defendant's Charges,
and very rarely (if ever) got the Money
the Suit cost him; it was well if he came
off without paying double Cost, that is,
their Cost whom he went to Law with, and
his own also.</P>
<P>IT is true, he was not reduc'd to Poverty
by it; but he was always kept embroil'd
and embarrass'd, and was not so rich by a
great many hundred Pounds, perhaps Thou∣sands,
as he would otherwise have been: At
last he met with one crabbed Tradesman,
<PB N="275" REF="291"/>
who held him so hard to it, that first and
last it cost him above 300 <HI>l.</HI> and he was cast
too, and oblig'd to pay Cost on the Defen∣dant's
Side; and this Piece of costly Expe∣rience
cur'd him of that quarrelsome Tem∣per,
and made him sick of the Law ever
after.</P>
<P>WHO can help wishing every litigious∣temper'd
Tradesman the like Success in his
quarrelling Proceedings, that we might have
many more such converted People among
us, that is to say, that being made wise by
their own Experience, they might quit the
hateful Disposition, and live at Peace with
their Fellow-tradesmen.</P>
<P>IT
is recorded of the <HI>Turks,</HI> that when
they had martial warlike Princes among
them, who by their Conduct enlarg'd their
Empire to the Magnitude we now see it ar∣riv'd
at, they took Care always to be ma∣king
War in one Place or other, on one
Side or other, that their Soldiery might not
lose their Vigour, that their Swords might
not rust, and that they might not want ex∣perienc'd
Officers, or have their Men unexer∣cis'd
in the Discipline; and take them, as they
were, a furious bloody Generation, that
made it their Business to over-run
the World;
yet they were right to themselves.</P>
<P>I think it may very aptly be brought
home to the Tradesman I am speaking of:
He is so enur'd to the contentious Habit,
<PB N="276" REF="292"/>
that if he should discontinue it any Time,
if he should be condemned to live at Peace
with his Neighbours, he would grow rusty,
and lose the Art of disturbing Mankind,
which is, in short, the chief Enjoyment of
his Life.</P>
<P>A Tradesman thus quarrelsome, wran∣gling
in every Bargain, disputing every
Trisle, and going to Law for every Dis∣pute,
living by Differences, and delighting
in Storms and Tempests, should be esteem'd
what we call a common Barreter in the
Law, or as a Scold among the Women; he
should be presented as a publick Nusance, a
common Disturber of the Neighbourhood;
and, as the Peace∣aker,
has the Blessing
of Heaven, and the Prayers of his Neigh∣bours
upon him, so this uneasy Creature
seems to be just in the contrary Situation,
and ought to expect the contrary from
both.</P>
<P>IN short, he that goes to Law with his
Neighbours for Trifles, that lives in Con∣tention
as in his Element, I do not see why
the famous Engine call'd a <HI>Ducking-stool</HI>
should
not be as proper an Application to
him, to cool his Passion, abate the Venom of
his Blood, and take out the Acrimony of his
Spirits, as it is to a little fiery outrageous
old Woman, that scolds Day and Night
merely to open her Pipes.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="293"/>
'TIS certain, the quarrelling Tradesman is a
common publick Grievance in the Country
where he dwells; and as his Conduct, or
rather Want of Conduct, is tormenting to
others, so it is pernicious to himself; 'tis rui∣nous
to his Family, destroys his Substance,
makes him hated among his Neighbours,
and in the End, he is vexatious to himself;
for he eats upon himself, as Envy is describ'd
by a Viper gnawing its own Bowels, so 'tis
most true in him; for his Envy, which, as
above, is the real Cause of his quarrelsome
Disposition, eats in upon himself, destroys
his Substance, which is the vital Strength
of his Business as a Tradesman, and reduces
him in the End to narrow Circumstances,
and perhaps to Poverty.</P>
<P>AND yet so it is; and I must take No∣tice
of it here, to the Scandal of our unhap∣py
<HI>English</HI> Temper, that even Poverty it∣self
does not put an End to it; and it is to
be seen in the Disposition even of the com∣mon
People; I mean the Poor: How are
they almost continually together by the Ears
among one another for Trisles, and carrying
on their wrangling Tempers by stated
Degrees, just as the quarrelsome Tradesmen
do among their Neighbours.</P>
<P>FIRST they differ a little, and which is
very particular, for little or nothing; then
it makes Words; Words raise the Passions;
then they scold, call Names, and perhaps
<PB N="278" REF="294"/>
fight; then away to the Justice for a War∣rant:
If the Justice is a good peaceable Gen∣tleman,
pities them, and perswades them to
make it up, as is often the Case, they fly out
into a Passion, and perhaps Rudeness, and away
they go to another Justice, and so to ano∣ther;
for they will have a Warrant, what∣ever
it costs them.</P>
<P>IF it be Matter of Right and Wrong,
though but to the Value of Sixpence or a
Shilling, away they run to an Officer, and
get a Writ; and I have seen a poor Crea∣ture,
that wanted Bread, pay sixteen or se∣venteen
Shillings for Charges, in prosecuting
a Debt of Ten Pence or a Shilling.</P>
<P>BUT above all, if it be Matter of Scan∣dal;
if in their Fury a hard Word has e∣scap'd,
and a hard Name been dropp'd, the
Lawyer is immediately employ'd, the poor
Wretch in Rags arrests the poor Wretch in
Rags,
<Q>And Beggars spend the Parish Alms at Law.</Q></P>
<P>IT is true, this is a Digression; but it is a
useful Digression; that the litigious Trades∣man
may see the Picture of his Behaviour in
Miniature: Here he may see the true Plan
of his own Disposition; and if any Thing
could make an Impression upon him, I think
this should; for as hateful as it is among
<PB N="279" REF="295"/>
the Poor, so much the more it is among the
Tradesmen, who live by their Business, and
who should be particularly careful to live
peaceably with every Body, because they
may be said indeed to get their Bread by
every Body; and if Contention does not
make them poor, I may venture to say it
will never make them rich.</P>
<P>I believe no Tradesman will ever get an
Estate by pulling other Tradesmen in Pieces;
and if he did, it is a horrid Way of encreasing
his Wealth; A contentious Humour certainly
tends to waste the Tradesman, not to en∣crease
him: It is true, he wastes those he
quarrels with; and that may be some Part
of his Satisfaction; and a wretched Satisfac∣tion
it is; but it will in the End waste him∣self
too: Wherefore, upon the whole, I
think the blessed A postle's Rule, as it was
good and wholsome for those he wrote to,
'tis still more so to a Tradesman, <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 15.
<HI>If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live
peaceably with all Men.</HI> I shall pursue the
Advice for the curing this Pestilence of
Trade in the next Chapter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="12" TYPE="chapter">
<PB N="280" REF="296"/>
<HEAD>CHAP. XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Tradesman's avoiding Law-Suits
and Contention in Business, and studying
to live peaceably with his Neighbours,
especially in Matters of Trade.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT has been said in the last
Chapters points at the two most scan∣dalous
Parts of a Tradesman's Life,
the grand Vices of a thriving Tradesman,
<HI>viz.</HI> his being impertinently Purse-proud,
and his being vexatious and quarrelsome:
'Tis to be hop'd, it may be sufficient to cau∣tion
a Tradesman of Sense and Modesty from
falling into either of those Snares, both fatal
to his Character, and both rendering him a
Burden and Offence to the World, as far as
his narrow Circle can extend.</P>
<P>I would now turn to the better∣anag'd
Tradesman;
who beginning-well, desires to
go on so; who endeavours to mind his Bu∣siness,
follow what is before him, and di∣sturb
no Body: As he is caution'd against
the quarrelsome Temper, and the Purse∣proud
Excursions of the other, by the odious
Example, so let me turn to him with Per∣swasions
for the rest of his Conduct, drawn
<PB N="281" REF="297"/>
from such Arguments as wife Men will al∣ways
listen to.</P>
<P>FOR his own sake, for his Family's sake,
for the sake of a good Fame among the best
Men, and that he may go through the World
with an easy and comfortable Suit, let him
<HI>study to be quiet, and to do his own Business,</HI>
that is, not to be the common Disturber of
his Neighbours, and the Aversion of his
Dealers.</P>
<P>WHO cares to deal with a Tradesman that
is always tormenting them with Cavils and
Quarrels, wrangling for Trifles, and going
to Law for meer Shadows of Difference, as
if he sought Advantages, and quarrelled for
the sake of Quarrelling?</P>
<P>THE best Customers will always shun
trading with such a Man. No, says the
County Tradesman, or Chapman, what
should I deal with him for, that is always
raising Objections, and seeking Advantages?
that when he has receiv'd one hundred Pound,
will go to Law with me for eighteen Pence;
always bringing some After-Reckonings to
cavil and wrangle about, and is never pleas'd
when a Man is in his Debt, or out of his
Debt? I love, adds the good honest Shop∣Keeper,
to trade where I can have honest
fair Dealing: I pay well, and I think I de∣serve
to be us'd well, and I will be us'd
well too, or I wont be us'd at all.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="298"/>
THE Tradesman who values his Business,
must always value his Customers; and as he
that does so, and uses them with Civility,
shall always keep them, and add to their
Number; so he that does not, shall always
lose them.</P>
<P>IT is a strange Temper of Uneasiness that
a Man should not be able to use those Men
well that he gets his Bread by, and keep
those Men fast to him that he is oblig'd to
for their Custom. As the Tradesman must
be just in all the Parts of his Correspon∣dence,
so he should be civil too; there is a
Courtesy in Trade as well as in Conversa∣tion,
which is due to every Body we deal
with; 'tis due in both, but much more in
Trade: Civility in Conversation is a Debt to
ourselves, as 'tis a Test of good Manners,
and gives a Lustre to Behaviour: But in
Trade 'tis a Debt to the Buyer; as in Money
the Borrower is Servant to the Lender, so in
Trade the Seller is so far Servant to the
Buyer.</P>
<P>HIS Shop is a Place to be invited into,
not to be commanded into; and therefore
we see the best Shop-Keepers
do not think
it below them to stand at the Door, and with
Cap in Hand, that is, with the utmost Re∣spect,
to ask their Customers to come in, to
see if they can please themselves, and find
what they have Occasion for.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="299"/>
FOR a Tradesman to be too proud thus to
invite his Customer, is to be above his Busi∣ness,
which is one of the worst Things can
be said of him; for he that is above his Bu∣siness
should leave it off, or else in Time he
may chance to turn the Tables, and his Busi∣ness
will be above him.</P>
<P>IF then an extraordinary Civility is a Debt
in Trade, from the Seller to the Buyer, to
be sure quarrelling and a litigious Wrangle
with the Buyer is a Breach of the just Con∣duct
of a Tradesman; it ought indeed to be
his Aversion, as certainly it will be the Buy∣er's
Avession in the End: Such a Tradesman
sells not the Parcel only, but the Customer,
and will in the End sell his Trade too; for no
Man will deal twice with him, after he dis∣covers
it once.</P>
<P>IT is objected here, that 'tis impossible for
a Man in a great Business to be without Broils
and Quarrels, and even Suits at Law some∣times
in the Course of his Trade; it will
happen, and he cannot avoid it, unless he
will always give up his Right: Sometimes
the Buyer or Customer, is the litigious Man;
He quarrels; the Bill of Parcel as soon as
the Goods are sent in, denies the Price of
Things, though agreed for, raises innumera∣ble
groundless Scruples and Objections, con∣trary
to Truth, and contrary to the Nature
of the Thing; and there's no dealing with
such Men; they are not to be oblig'd; they
<PB N="284" REF="300"/>
are not to be won by Courtesy or good
Usage, but play upon all those Things, and
take their Advantages of them; what can a
Man do?</P>
<P>THIS is a well-grounded Objection,
if true; and in this Case the Tables are
turn'd just the other Way: The Buyer is then
become the Man of Strife, and the litigious
Man; the Breach of the Harmony is all
in him: And I add then, my Reproof lies
upon him, and not upon the Seller. The
Tradesman may err in both Extremes; he
may be a wrangling contentious Person,
which End of the Staff soever he holds;
and the Reproof is to him that is guilty, not
to the other; to the Agressor, not the Per∣son
attack'd.</P>
<P>WHEN the Man has bought Goods, and
the Price is agreed on, he ought to acquiesce
in the Price, and not raise Cavils and Dis∣putes
afterward, to perplex the Case, making
a plain Bargain difficult, and disputing
a just Demand; forcing the Tradesman he
dealt with to go to Law for a just Debt;
than which nothing is more scandalous in
Trade.</P>
<P>BUT it is still the same Thing; the Ad∣vice
is just and well founded; as the Seller
should avoid being litigious and contentious,
so should the Buyer also; for Justice is the
same in all.</P>
<P><PB N="285" REF="301"/>
I grant sometimes in Trade, Law-Suits
and Contention are not to be avoided; and
where there is a great Business, the Occasions
of such Breaches often happen, so that unless
the most injurious Things in Nature are to
be born with, and unless the Defendant will
suffer Depredations upon his Property, and
even allow himself to be plunder'd, he must
defend himself, and seek his Protection in
the Law.</P>
<P>BUT this has no Relation to what I am
speaking of; this is not to be litigious, but to
defend a Man's Interest and Family against
the litigious quarrelling Dealer, perhaps a
Tradesman too; but the Character is al∣ways
due to the Agressor; for the most
quiet inoffensive Man in the World must de∣fend
himself if he is attack'd; Nature re∣quires
it, Duty to his Family requires it, com∣mon
Justice, and indeed Necessity, calls up∣on
him to do it.</P>
<P>BUT this, I say, is not the Man I am
speakingof: It is the Agressor; 'tis the Plain∣tiff,
not the Defendant, that is the quarrel∣ling
litigious Tradesman, and who justly
comes under the Reproof of this Work.
The Difference is very plain in the Manner
of their going to Law: The quiet, honest,
inoffensive Tradesman may be Plaintiff, but
the querulous litigious Tradesman is never
Defendant. By never, I must be understood
to mean, very rarely, very seldom: He al∣ways
<PB N="286" REF="302"/>
falls out first, he is easy to quarrel,
loth to be reconcil'd; he does no Right,
and takes no Wrong; this is the Man that (I
say) should be deem'd a common Disturber
in the Sense of the Law, and especially in
the Sense of his Neighbours.</P>
<P>I think I need say very little to set out
to the Considering Tradesman, the hateful
Picture of this Kind of Man, and less to
warn him from following the Example:
He is the Contempt of his Rich, and the
Aversion of his Poorer Neighbours, the
Scandal of his Trade, and the Terror of
his Customers.</P>
<P>AND what must we say now to the Com∣pleat
Tradesman, with Respect to this Prac∣tice?
There are so many Pleas for it, so ma∣ny
Arguments in the Defence of it, that the
Tradesmen seem to approve of the Thing,
even where they do not follow the Example:
Nay, you have frequent Excuses made for
such People by some Tradesmen, upon a
Kind of simple Policy, least we should think
it was not allowable to a Tradesman to sue
for his just Debt, even where they could
not be otherwise recover'd.</P>
<P>BUT such shall have an Opportunity to see
themselves mistaken: It is necessary there∣fore
to distinguish a little in this Case be∣tween
the litigious quarrelling Temper I am
exposing, and the necessary Recovery of our
Right.</P>
<P><PB N="287" REF="303"/>
THERE are some Men so fond of going to
Law for their Debts, that they will sue for
their Money by Process, when they may
have it without; that will hardly demand a
Debt but by a Writ, and who sends the At∣torney
or the Bailiff to a Debtor before they
ask for the Money: These are the Men I
point at in this Discourse; but as some are
thus in the Extreme one Way, so some again
will pay no Body, till they are forc'd to it,
and they are in the Extreme another Way.</P>
<P>THE happy Medium between these Ex∣tremes,
and which I would recommend to
the Compleat Tradesman, is this:
<Q><P>1. NOT to decline or delay paying a just
Debt, if able to discharge it, but to
pay it without giving any Man Cause,
or putting him to the Charge of suing
for his own.</P>
<P>2. NOT to give any Man Trouble, tho' for a
just Debt, where there is any Probabi∣lity
of obtaining it without, no, nor till
all reasonable, Quiet, and friendly Me∣thods
are tried to avoid it.</P>
<P>3. When oblig'd by Necessity to use Vio∣lence,
that is to say, the Violence of a
legal Prosecution, yet to do it with Ci∣vility,
with Tenderness, without ex∣posing
the Debtor more than needs must,
and above all without putting him to
more than necessary Charges: This
<PB N="288" REF="304"/>
shews a just Reluctance to the Thing,
and testifies, that the Plantiff, (that is,
the Tradesman,) would not have thus
sued for his Debt, if not forc'd by una∣voidable
Necessity; in which Case the
Defendant is justly answerable for all
the Evils, which he suffers, and which
he brings thus upon himself.</P></Q></P>
<P>As it is in Matter of Debt, that all possi∣ble
Means should be used to avoid coming
to Extremeties with the Debtor, so in Mat∣ters
of Right and Wrong, disputed and con∣tended,
about the honest peaceable Tradesman,
will, as far as in him lies, prevent a Decision
at Law; if it be possible, he will bring all
Differences to a friendly Accommodation, by
Expostulation, by Application, by Arbitra∣tion,
nay, and even abating sometimes much
of his Demands for Peace sake.</P>
<P>WHEN two Tradesmen of this pacifick
Temper meet, a Reference never fails to put
an End to all Disputes between them: A
Man that means Honestly, is never afraid or
asham'd to refer all his Differences to the next
unbiass'd and indifferent Man he meets: He
embraces all Occasions of bringing such
Things to an amicable peaceable Conclusion;
he leaves no Stone unturn'd to persuade his
Opposer, to convince him he is wrong; that
he does him Injustice; that to contend at Law,
is but weakning himself, and injuring both;
<PB N="289" REF="305"/>
that it is but throwing away their Money,
which is the Life and Blood of their Trade;
like Princes making War for Trifles, where
both Sides are sure to be Loosers, and to spill
the Blood of their innocent Subjects for no∣thing,
or at least nothing comparatively.</P>
<P>IT may be possible, that Both the contend∣ing
Tradesmen may be in the Right, and
both in the Wrong; that is to say, one may
be right in one Particular, and one in an∣other,
while both the Particulars are Part of
the Dispute. <HI>If both are peaceably inclin'd,</HI>
a grave Neighbour of a healing Disposition,
such a Compleat Tradesman as I describ'd
in the last Chapter, who having left off Bu∣siness
with Reputation, and particularly with
the Reputation of a Man of Sense and Tem∣per:
Such a one being call'd in, never fails
to make up the Breach, to reconcile all the
Differences, and shew them how easily they
might, with the Help of a little Moderation,
have done it without him.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, if <HI>two Tradesmen,</HI>
who are Men of Passion, both hot, both
quarrelsome, and given to Law-Suits, Men
of Contention and Strife, <HI>that is,</HI> Lovers of
it, such as I have describ'd; if those two
meet in a Breach, 'tis like two Enemies meet∣ing
in a Mine; one brings Fire, and the o∣ther
Gunpowder, and both are blown up to∣gether.</P>
<P><PB N="290" REF="306"/>
IN order then to prevail with the Man of
Business, to act upon a better View, and
with wiser Measures, we need do no more
than recommend to him the Example of the
litigious Tradesman, when, <HI>as we say in
other Cases,</HI> he meets with his Match: When
two such fiery hot-headed People meet toge∣thes,
let him but calmly observe, how like
two Mastiffs they worry one another; how
they waste their Substance in the needless
Expence, raise their Spleen in the Aggrava∣tions
and Provocations which they meet with
in the Proceedings; for the Rage rises with
the Expences, and the Men are like two Li∣ons
in two cages, who are tearing one an∣other
in Pieces in their Imagination, and are
really eager to do it, but cannot come at
one another to make use either of Teeth or
Claws.</P>
<P>THE litigious Tradesman who I am thus
describing, are acting the Brutes, not the
Christians; they pursue one another with
personal Spleen, not with a just Demand of
Right. To set this Part in a true Light, we
ought to state the Thing it self; that which
we call in our Language, <HI>Going to Law:</HI>
The simple and direct Meaning is, a Man
who is injur'd by another in his Property,
<HI>that is,</HI> kept out of his Money unreasona∣bly
long, or positively denied Payment of his
just Due, or is otherwise manifestly injured,
appeals to the Judge or Judges of his Coun∣try
<PB N="291" REF="307"/>
to do him Right, to order his Oppo∣nent,
and reduce him to the Necessity of an∣swering
his Demands, according to Law.</P>
<P>THE very Nature of the Thing intimates,
that this is, in every wise Man, an Act not
of Choice, but of Necessity; and that it
ought to be so; that no honest Man will pro∣ceed
in this Manner with another, if he can
avoid it; for who would chuse to get that by
War, which he might obtain with Peace;
and I have sometimes thought, that it is ma∣ny
Ways best for us in this Nation, that in
Suits at Law 'tis generally found the Victor
is a Loser; that so Men may see a Reason be∣fore-hand,
why they should not <HI>go to Law,</HI>
if they can avoid it.</P>
<P>BUT to return: <HI>Going to Law,</HI> is an Ap∣peal
of Right; as it is an Appeal to the Law,
so its End must be Peace; and this may, and
indeed ought always to be done with Temper:
When I say its End is Peace, I would be
rightly understood thus; the only justifiable
End of going to Law, is that Right being
first done me, I may be at Peace, may live
in Charity and good Neighbourhood, other∣wise
we make the Breach in a Civil Matter
become criminal.</P>
<P>FOR Men to make a Dispute at Law be
a formal Quarrel, engage their Passions in
the Difference, and turn their Trade-Breaches
into Breaches of Charity and Breaches of
T<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mper: This is to put off the Christian,
<PB N="292" REF="308"/>
and the Man of Sense both together; if this
were the true End and the justifiable Prac∣tice
in going to Law, such Men could not
be call'd Christians, according to the Rules
of Christianity; nor could they be admitted
to the Sacrament while such a Suit at Law
continued.</P>
<P>THIS Way of going to Law had a terrible
Event a few Years ago in this Nation, and
left a bloody Precedent, <HI>viz.</HI> in the late
Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> and the Lord <HI>Mohun:</HI> They
had been many Years contending at Law a∣bout
an Estate; the Particulars are not mate∣rial
here; but meeting occasionally while the
Suit was depending, the Heat of the legal
Process broke out in an illegal Flame; they
differ in Words, give and return disobliging
Expressions, (to say no worse of it;) this
kindles their Passions, both hot, both brave,
and neither of them over-much Master of
their Temper. <HI>In a word,</HI> they quarrel, a
Challenge ensues, they both meet, both fight,
and were both kill'd. I need say no more,
the Story is too well known, and was too
lately acted to be forgot.</P>
<P>THIS is the Case in Substance, though not
carried on to such a fatal Length, with all the
Men who go to Law upon Trifles, and carry
on their Suits at Law with Heat and Ani∣mosity;
in short, they go to Law like Duke
<HI>Hamilton</HI> and Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> and if they had
<PB N="293" REF="309"/>
Courage to engage, would put it to the like
Issue.</P>
<P>IF the Tradesman should not go to Law
at all, but with evident Necessity, and not
till he is satisfied, he cannot obtain his Right
by any other Way, it is a Consequence that
he should not proceed in it with personal
Feud and Animosity: As he should enter
upon it with Reluctance, so he should go
on with it in the same Temper; always pre∣serving
a Willingness to be reconcil'd, and
to make an amicable End of the Dispute;
always testifying that he seeks nothing but his
Right, and that once granted, he has no
farther View.</P>
<P>HE that goes to Law upon any other
View, may be said not to Go to Law,
but to <HI>fight at Law;</HI> that is, he fights his
Opposer with the Weapons of the Law,
and he fights him indeed as an Enemy, to
kill and destroy him, to wound, hurt, and
indeed ruin him: I need not explain it; we
have too many Examples of it among us.</P>
<P>THIS I affirm is not a lawful going to
Law: But above all, this should not be the
Tradesman's Way of living among his
Neighbours: It will neither gain him Cre∣dit
or Comfort, nor will it advance his Trade
at all; for when once a Tradesman gains
the Repute of a litigious, quarrelsome, sple∣natick
Man among his Fellow-Tradesmen
and Dealers, no Body cares to deal with
<PB N="294" REF="310"/>
him, and they that do, always endeavour to
keep him at Arm's End, act with him upon
the Square, and with the utmost Caution,
as with a Man that lies upon the Catch for
all Advantages, and that will draw them
into a Snare, if he can.</P>
<P>IN a few Words then, I must advise the
Tradesman to avoid the Cause, as he would
avoid the Character; avoid the Scandal of
a litigious quarrelling Temper in Business, as
the worst Thing that can be said of him, I
mean in Trade: Indeed, a Tradesman can∣not
have a worse Character in the World,
except it be that of downright Cheat and
Fraud; and if he is come to that, he is out
of the Rank of those that I am speaking
to; he is no more a Compleat Tradesman,
but a Knave; a Tradesman degenerated into
a Devourer; a kind of ravenous Creature, of
the wolish Kind, that watches, and lies in
wait for his Neighbours, to ruin and de∣stroy
them.</P>
<P>AND this leads me to the great Article
of a Tradesman's Tenderness and Compas∣sion
to his Debtors, who are justly his Deb∣tors,
but perhaps are not always able to an∣swer
his Demands, or at least not to answer
them in their due Time, either when he ex∣pects
it, or indeed when Reason demands it.</P>
<P>YET even to such the Tradesman under
the several Denominations, in which I have
describ'd him, will treat them with Ten∣derness:
<PB N="295" REF="311"/>
It is true, he ought to be paid,
and the Debtor ought to shew a just Endea∣vour
to pay him; for 'tis but too true, there
are some litigious Tempers, even in Debtors,
that will abuse the utmost Patience, that
will delay Payment, even when they are
able to answer the Debt; in a word, that
will not pay till they are forc'd, and
that wickedly take all Advantages possible
to evade the Payment of just Debts, what∣ever
Charge they are at, or whatever Charge
they put others to.</P>
<P>WITH these I am not directing the Trades∣man
how he should act: As they seem to
ask no Pity, so they certainly deserve none;
they are not only mischievous to themselves,
but they are the Cause of much Severity to
Men of better Principles; who suffer some∣times
very deeply, because they are not dis∣tinguish'd
from Men who act knavishly and
deceitfully.</P>
<P>BUT the Tradesman using a just Endea∣vour
to find it out, will distinguish between
them; will soon see the industrious poor
Tradesman, who would pay punctually if
he could, and who does pay as he can, and
as fast as he is able; from the litigious De∣fendant
Tradesman, who, though able to
pay, stands out to the last against a just Debt;
tries all possible Shifts, and Tricks of the
Law, to evade, to delay, to put off; suffers
Judgment by Default to protract Time, brings
<PB N="296" REF="312"/>
Writs of Error, to hang up the Cause, as they
call it, and at last either shifts out of the
Way, and carries his Goods away, and
breaks, or otherwise makes it up as well as
he can, to the Loss of the Prosecutor as
well as himself: I say the Difference between
these two may be clearly discover'd with a
little Care and Caution, and the Tradesman
then will know how to govern himself.</P>
<P>FOR the poor honest Tradesman, he for∣bears
him, takes the Money as he can pay
it, shews him all the Tenderness and Com∣passion
that good Temper and good Princi∣ples
dictate to him; and by this Means often
gets in his Debts, which, under a rash and
rigorous Prosecution, would have been lost,
and the poor Debtor ruin'd also.</P>
<P>AND this indeed is what I mention it for:
A Tradesman who is in Condition to forbear
an industrious, decaying, or reduc'd Fel∣low-Tradesman,
will find this a general
Truth, with very few Exceptions, <HI>viz.</HI> For∣bearance
has sav'd many a poor Tradesman,
and been a Means to his recovering in the
World; while Cruelty and furious falling
upon a Debtor, has run down many a Trades∣man,
whose Circumstances have been other∣wise
good, and has been his Ruin.</P>
<P>IT is an unhappy Truth with many
Tradesmen, That Misfortunes seldom come
alone; the Case is often deriv'd from this
Original, <HI>viz.</HI> that a rash passionate Credi∣tor
<PB N="297" REF="313"/>
not only falls upon him, but does it
with Rage, and perhaps something of Spleen,
but to be sure with Passion; and exposing
him to the common Talk of the Place,
brings other Demands upon him, one in the
Neck of another, till the Man, not able to
stand a Storm, though he might have stood
against one Shock or two, is overwhelmed,
even before his Time.</P>
<P>IT is a terrible Article to a poor Trades∣man,
when he falls into the Hands of a
Creditor of this litigious quarrelsome Tem∣per;
he is sure to find no Mercy, no good
Usage, no Civility from him.</P>
<P>BUT I come back to the Point: I am ad∣vising
a Tradesman how to govern himself
in this Part of his trading Conduct; and I
believe he will find himself advis'd for his
own Advantage.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Court no Trade-Quarrels;</HI> go to Law
with no Body, tho' for your just Due,
if it may be obtained without it: What
reasonable Man will seek his Right by
violent and rough Means, that may ob∣tain
it by soft and smooth Methods.</P>
<P>2.<HI>Try all the Methods of Gentleness and
Patience,</HI> which a forbearing Temper
can dictate, or which Prudence and the
Safety of your Debt will allow, before
you proceed to Rigour and Prosecution.</P>
<P><PB N="298" REF="314"/>
3. <HI>If you are forced</HI> to such Prosecution
of Right, as the Law directs, yet act
in it so as may testify the Reluctance
of your Mind; that you are forced to
act as you do, and that nothing of
Heat and Passion has moved you to it;
but the mere absolutely necessary Care
of your Interest and Family.</P>
<P>4.<HI>Proceed with all due Caution</HI> for the
Reputation of your Debtor, without
exposing him where it may be avoided,
without putting him to needless and
extravagant Expences, and, if possible,
without leaving him to the Cruelty and
exacting Violence of Bailiffs and At∣torneys.</P>
<P>5. In a word, <HI>be always ready</HI> to put an
End to such Prosecutions by Arbitra∣tions,
where the Nature of the Thing
will allow them, and upon moderate
Terms, where they will not, rather
abating than rigorously exacting the
utmost of your Demands.</P></Q>
<P>THIS is the Temper of the truly Chris∣tian
and Peaceable Tradesman: This will
gain him two inestimable Blessings, the most
valuable in Life, namely, Peace of Mind,
and the Love and Esteem of all his honest
Neighbours.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION to the Second PART.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE former Volume of this Work
chiefly respects the Introducti∣on
of a young Tradesman into
his Business, and Dirctions for
his carrying it on, and especially
for his personal conduct in it; the seasona∣ble
Advice, and the substantial Instructions
<PB N="2" REF="316"/>
there given, are such, that if well accepted,
studied, and pursued, they will certainly lay
a firm foundation for a Tradesman's establish∣memt
and prosperity.</P>
<P>The world has been convinc'd of the
usefulness of those Instructions; they have
been received with a general approbation,
they have been made acceptable in their
manner, as they are useful in their me∣thod;
and they seem to be made a <HI>vade me∣cum</HI>
for the ages to come, by the reception
they have met with in the age that is
past.</P>
<P>But the readers of the first Volume seem
to rise from it with an appetite, and it has
been a kind of a general notion in their
reading, certainly the hand that has been
employ'd to give all those kind Directions
is able to give more; and they look at me
with a kind of an expectation of some∣thing
yet to come.</P>
<P>It is certain, the subject is copious, I
might say 'tis even voluminous, and there
is still room for much more to be said than
has yet been possible in the narrow compass
of one single volume to be express'd.</P>
<P>Trade is an ocean, the best and most ex∣perienc'd
Sailor needs his Pilot books, his
navigating Instruments, his Cross-staff, Qua∣drant,
Compass, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to steer by, and take
his observations, and it may with truth be
said, the Mathematicians on shore make all
<PB N="3" REF="317"/>
the Ships sail at sea, for 'tis by their Rules,
their Scales, their Tables of Lines and Tan∣gents,
by their Problems, and Experiments,
that the expert Seamen direct their Ships,
keep their Reckonings, and perform their
Voyages.</P>
<P>Trade, I say, is an ocean, they that sail in
it, however experienc'd, have always need
of Directions; the various changes and turns
that Trade takes in the nature and conse∣quence
of things, and by the length of time,
are such, that the most experienc'd Trades∣man
may stand in need of new Instructions
and Hints, and make daily discoveries of
things, which he knew nothing of before.</P>
<P>How frequent is it to hear an old Tradesman
say, Trade is quite altered, since I knew it;
the methods are chang'd, the course of things
is chang'd, the manner both of buying and sel∣ling
is altered; the Manufactures are chang'd,
the very places where they are made are
chang'd, the Manufacturers remove from
town to town, and the places know them no
more; the Markets remove where they are
sold, and even the demands of them both
abroad and at home, the very Nations to
which they were exported in former times,
take none now; and Nations which for∣merly
made no use of them, are now the
particular Staple or Market for them? As ha∣bits
and the form of clothing are chang'd
by the fancies and fashions of Men, so Trade
<PB N="4" REF="318"/>
is necessarily bound to follow the customs
which the same fashions and fancies intro∣duce.
The Manufactures indeed, are in kind
the same, because the principles of all Ma∣nufactures
are the same. Wool, Flax, Silk
and Hair, are the four grand principles and
foundations of Manufacture, as drugs and
plants are the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> the princi∣ples
of Physic and Pharmacy.</P>
<P>But tho' the principles are the same, the
management of the materials differ continu∣ally;
invention forms the modes of wear∣ing,
and art follows as invention leads. The
Manufacturing is the effect of art, the ma∣terials
are the work of Nature; the first are
variable, but the last is the same. The Silk
of <HI>Persia,</HI> and the <HI>Indies,</HI> and the fine Linen
of <HI>Egypt</HI> were the Manufactures and Mer∣chandizes
of <HI>Tyre,</HI> as ancient as the first
ages of Trade; and I could run out my dis∣course
in a useful as well as diverting dis∣course
upon the antiquity of Trade and Ma∣nufacture,
from the vast variety of the pro∣duct
of the World, as far back as the Pro∣phet
<HI>Ezekiel;</HI> but I shall not take up your
time with things so remote.</P>
<P>The present use of it is to observe the
various changes which Trade has suffer'd;
the several turns given to the Manufactures
by the invention of Men; the violent re∣movings
of the Manufactures, and the Mar∣kets
of them from one City to another, and
<PB N="5" REF="319"/>
from one Nation to another, as Wars, the
convulsions of Nations, and the fate of the
World has directed.</P>
<P>In proportion to these, tho' not equal in
degree, we see daily changes in the na∣ture
of our Commerce, in the kinds of our
Manufacture among our selves, in their sorts,
their value, the places of their making, and
of their vending; and this makes room for
new observations and instructions to the
Tradesman. He that was expert in business
forty year ago, let him lay by, and be out
of Trade but twenty year, will have need al∣most
to serve a new Apprenticeship, and
learn new skill and judgment in the Goods
he formerly dealt in; and in a word, will
want just to begin where he begun be∣fore.</P>
<P>And
yet the materials are still the same,
the Silks of <HI>Persia</HI> are transported to <HI>Italy,</HI>
to <HI>France</HI> and to <HI>Spittlefields;</HI> the raw Silk
is remov'd, I mean the very growth of it,
from the banks of the <HI>Caspian,</HI> to the banks
of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; and from the
shores of <HI>Georgia</HI> to the shores of <HI>Italy;</HI>
and the Manufactures of <HI>Asia</HI> are infinitely
out done in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>The fine Linen of <HI>Egypt</HI> is remov'd to
<HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the dyeing of
Purple and Scarlet, for which the <HI>Phoenici∣ans</HI>
were so fam'd, is lost to that part of
<PB N="6" REF="320"/>
the World, and set up in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Hol∣land.</HI></P>
<P>To
bring this home, we find several bran∣ches
of our Manufactures in <HI>England</HI> chang'd,
and some of them remov'd; the kinds of
them alter'd, the demand for them chang'd,
and that within our own memory, as shall
be at large shew'd in its place.</P>
<P>By this means, and for this reason, the
Trade is chang'd, the face of it is chang'd,
and the place of it; for the Trade follows
the demand, as the Cart follows the Horse
that draws it.</P>
<P>This variety gives, as I have said, a new
face to things, and the Manufacturer has
daily new rules to learn, new customs to set
up, and new measures to take, such as his
Fore-fathers never knew, and so it will be
to the end of time.</P>
<P>It is become a policy in Trade, to alter
Fashions and Customs; not only in Cloths,
that part was always variable, at least in these
parts of the World; but it never went such
a length in other things as it does now:
For the Fashions alter now in the more
durable kinds of things, such as Furni∣ture
of Houses, Equipages, Coaches, nay even
of Houses themselves; and Houses built
twenty or thirty years ago, are now old fa∣shion'd,
and must be pull'd down, to build
more modish Apartments; and we see more
new Houses at this time in <HI>England,</HI> built
<PB N="7" REF="321"/>
within twenty to thirty years, than were
built in <HI>England</HI> in two hundred years be∣fore.</P>
<P>This
must needs give a new turn to the
Trade, and that of course gives new methods
and new measures to the Manufacturers,
obliges them to a continual study of novel∣ty,
and to rack their invention for new Fa∣shions,
introduces new Customs, and even
gives a turn to Trade it self.</P>
<P>Upon this foundation it becomes neces∣sary,
to an <HI>English Tradesman,</HI> to give him a
state of the <HI>English</HI> Trade, an account of its
present, not its past situation; and to let him
see, not what it has been, but what it is, and
not what a <HI>Tradesman</HI> was to do forty years a∣go,
but what he is to do now, in order to carry
on his business prosperously and successfully.</P>
<P>Nor has the state and nature of Trade on∣ly
suffer'd a change; but the <HI>Tradesmen</HI>
themselves are fallen into more extravagan∣cies,
and make new kinds of excursions
out of their business, run new hazards and
dangers, and are ruin'd by new and differ∣ent
ways than they did, or indeed than they
could formerly.</P>
<P>In the good old days of Trade, which
our Fore-fathers plodded on in, and got
Estates too at, there were no Bubbles, no
Stock-jobbing, no South-sea Infatuations,
no Lotteries, no Funds, no Annuities, no
buying of Navy Bills, and publick Securi∣ties,
<PB N="8" REF="322"/>
no circulating Exchequer Bills; in a
word, Trade was a vast great River, and all
the Money in the Kingdom ran down its
mighty stream; the whole wealth of the Na∣tion
kept in its Channel, and there were
no new Canals or Side-drains laid open to
abate its waters, to divert its current, and
to carry its stream off from the ordinary
course.</P>
<P>Whereas now half your Trading Ma∣nufacturers
are Stock-jobbers, and half the
stock of the Nation is diverted from the
channel of Trade to run waste, as I may
say, and like a River without banks, to
drown the flat country, and spoil the in∣dustry
of the Plough and the Husbandman.
Or like a river which used to drive many
Mills, when the Water is by new Drains
drawn off, and the Stream diverted, they have
scarce Water enough left in the ordinary
Channel to keep the Mills just jogging on,
not in full work, and sometimes, nay too
often, they stand still for want of Water;
whereas sometimes they have been known
to be in danger of blowing up by a too great
weight upon them.</P>
<P>In a word, and to leave allegories, Trade
is limited and straightn'd in abundance of ar∣ticles,
by the diverting so vast a stock of ready
Money from it, as our Stocks, and Banks,
and Funds carry out of that ordinary course;
and by the reducing Paper Credit to a much
<PB N="9" REF="323"/>
narrower compass than it was formerly at,
and by several other things which are acci∣dents
to Trade particular to these times, and
which Tradesmen were never acquainted
with before.</P>
<P>For this reason a new state of Commerce,
and new Instructions to Trading Manufa∣cturers,
for their carrying on their Trades,
and for the management of themselves, af∣ter
the new methods of Trade, is very suita∣ble
to these times; and must be useful to our
Trading Manufacturers, and this is the far∣ther
design of this Work.</P>
<P>Previous to this undertaking, and preli∣minary
to this part of it, 'tis necessary to
mention, that I am still confining my self
in this work to our <HI>English</HI> Trade; that is
to say, the home Trade, and home Traders,
including a little of our shipping and sailing;
so far only as it relates to our inland river na∣vigation,
and the coasting Trade, which be∣longs
to, and is wholly cairried on within our
selves; not at all concerning our selves with
the Merchant or the Merchandizing part of
our Trade, how great soever it is, and how∣ever
well worth considering; nay, the
greater and more worth considering that
part may be, the more I shall avoid med∣ling
with it here, referring it to be talk'd
of in its proper place, well meriting to be
spoken of apart, and unincumbred with
any other discourse.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="324"/>
It is no boast, nor any peculiarity or par∣tiality
to our selves to say, that <HI>England</HI>
is at this time not only a Nation of the
greatest Trade in the World, but is the cen∣ter
of the whole Commerce of <HI>Europe</HI> at
least, if not the whole trading World.
I prove it by these two heads.</P>
<Q><P>I. It exports more value of its own pro∣duce,
and of the labour of its own peo∣ple,
than any other Nation.</P>
<P>II. It consumes more of the Growth and
Produce, Labour and Manufacture of
foreign Countries, than any other Na∣tion.</P></Q>
<P>The first shews the value and excellence
of its Produce, and of its Manufactures, and
the demand for them in other Countries.</P>
<P>And the second proves the dependance
foreign Nations have upon the <HI>English</HI>
Trade, for the consumption of their Goods,
and without which they would not know
how to vent or dispose of them.</P>
<P>And to bring it to the point in debate,
both these shew the greatness and prodigi∣ous
extent of our home Trade, which with∣out
partiality is certainly beyond any other
Nation in <HI>Europe;</HI> and including <HI>Scotland</HI>
and <HI>Ireland,</HI> which yet are not considerable
in proportion to the rest, greater than all
<PB N="11" REF="325"/>
the rest of the inland Commerce of <HI>Europe.</HI>
As to our Plantations or Colonies, they are
naturally to be included, their people being
our own, and their consumption always to
be reckon'd as part of our own, their Pro∣duce
our Produce, and their Wealth our
Wealth; and so it is, in all cases cosider'd,
I say our Trade so consider'd, is I believe
greater than all the inland Trade of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It may be worth while, but to take a short
view here of our importation of Goods of
foreign growth from abroad, which Goods,
<HI>for such I shall only mention,</HI> are chiefly
made use of, and consumed at home, as for
such as are exported again to other Coun∣tries,
I take little notice of them.</P>
<P>The Wines and Brandy imported from
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> when our Trade was open
with <HI>France,</HI> was so great, that 'tis hardly cre∣dible;
according to an account given in
from the Custom-house, they amounted as
follows.</P>
<P>Wine 22372 ton.</P>
<P>Brandy 11291 ton.</P>
<P>That Trade being since check'd by prohi∣bitions,
and high duties, the brandy is
indeed brought in by smuggling and clan∣destine
Trade, so that no estimate can be
made of it; and the channel of the wine
Trade being turn'd, we imported in the
year 1621. into the port of <HI>London</HI> only,
as follows,
<LIST>
<PB N="12" REF="326"/>
<ITEM>Portugal wine 20938 pipes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Spanish wine 14147 pipes.</ITEM>
<ITEM>French wine 999 ton.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Rhenish wine 358 1/2 ton.</ITEM>
</LIST>
All these wines are consum'd at home,
besides the several quantities imported in
the out-ports of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> and
in <HI>Scotland,</HI> which tho' uncertain, yet by
an ordinary computation thus.</P>
<P>The importation in the out-ports of
<HI>Great Britain,</HI> and including <HI>Ireland,</HI> esti∣mated
at one third of the quantity import∣ed
at <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The importation of wine in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in∣cluding
<HI>French,</HI> and inclusive of the wines
run on shore there, and at the Isle of <HI>Man,</HI>
are indeed too low in this calculation by
a great deal.</P>
<P>The importation of brandy has been nine
thousand ton a year, suppose it now at
one half, so that by estimation, the <HI>British</HI>
Dominions import yearly from <HI>France, Spain,
Portugal</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> above forty thousand ton
of wine and brandy, besides <HI>Madera</HI> wine
yearly carried to our <HI>West India</HI> Colonies,
which, one year with another, amounts to
above a thousand pipes a year.</P>
<P>2. The Silk in bales, raw and thrown silk
including, the <HI>East-Indies</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> a∣mounts
to an incredible quantity, all which
<PB N="13" REF="327"/>
is manufactured at home, except a very small
quantity sent to <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>1000 bales and chests from <HI>India</HI> and <HI>China</HI>
raw silk.</P>
<P>2000 bales from <HI>Turkey.</HI></P>
<P>2000 bales from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily.</HI></P>
<P>The value of this at but 100<HI>l.</HI> per bale, one
with another, is 500000<HI>l.</HI> per Annum.</P>
<P>3. Add to this, that the fruit properly call'd
so, (<HI>viz.</HI>) raisins, figs, almonds, oranges, le∣mons,
currants, raisins of the sun, particular∣ly
so called, from <HI>Alicant, Denia</HI> and Xevia.</P>
<P>Other raisins from <HI>Malaga,</HI> almonds from
<HI>Barbary.</HI></P>
<P>Oranges and lemons from <HI>Seville,</HI> and
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> and <HI>Malaga.</HI></P>
<P>Oyl from <HI>Seville</HI> and <HI>Lisbon, Cadiz</HI> and
<HI>Oporto.</HI></P>
<P>Other oyl from <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> as also from <HI>Ge∣noa</HI>
and <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>Figs from <HI>Faro</HI> and <HI>Figuera.</HI></P>
<P>Currants from <HI>Zant</HI> and <HI>Cephalonia.</HI>
Almost the whole quantity of these are im∣ported
here, the <HI>Dutch</HI> or <HI>French</HI> take very
few of them; except some oranges and le∣mons
to <HI>Holland; France</HI> has them of their
own.</P>

<P><PB N="14" REF="328"/>
The quantity of linen imported yearly in∣to
<HI>England</HI> is so prodigious great, besides
our own linen now greatly encreas'd from
<HI>Ireland</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> that no estimate can
be made of it; the least that I have heard it
valued at, has been a million sterling <HI>per
Annum.</HI> And I have a great deal of reason
to believe, that it is very much less than
the quantity amounts to.</P>
<P>5. Besides the importation of linen-yarn,
which is manufactur'd here, and which is
now every day encreasing.</P>
<P>6. Add to this the great consumption of
other petty imports from <HI>Holland,</HI> call'd ha∣berdashry
ware, such as thread and incle,
gimps, bonelace, and other goods of that
kind, the quantity of which is exceeding
great. As also,</P>
<P>7. Dye stuffs, such as woad and madder,
shumack, orchill, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>8. Also the great importation of cotton,
as well cotton-wool as cotton-yarn from
<HI>Turkey,</HI> chiefly from <HI>Smyrna</HI> and <HI>Scandaroon,</HI>
with goats hair, camels hair, <HI>Grogram</HI> yarn,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> all for Manufacturing in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>9. Spices of the <HI>Indies</HI> by way of <HI>Hol∣land,</HI>
cloves, nutmegs, mace, cinnamon, all
consum'd among our selves.</P>
<P>10. <HI>Spanish</HI> wool, an article of great va∣lue,
and principally brought hither.</P>
<P>11. Iron from <HI>Sweden,</HI> and some from
<HI>Biscay</HI> in <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="329"/>
12. Naval stores from the <HI>Baltic, (viz.)</HI>
Tar, pitch, rosin, hemp and flax, generally
call'd naval stores.</P>
<P>13. Deals, timber and masts from <HI>Nor∣way.</HI></P>
<P>14.
Sulphur, (brimstone) and block mar∣ble,
from <HI>Naples, Genoa, Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>15. Pickles (<HI>viz.</HI>) anchovies, capers, o∣lives,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>ditto.</HI></P>
<P>16. Paper from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> a very
great quantity.</P>
<P>17. Drugs of many sorts from <HI>Turkey,
Barbary, Spain</HI> and the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P>18. Cochineal, indigo, cocao and dying
woods, from <HI>New Spain</HI> and <HI>Brasil,</HI> by way
of <HI>Cadiz</HI> and <HI>Lisbon.</HI></P>
<P>19. Gold and silver from <HI>Guinea,</HI> and
<HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>20. Salt-peter, calicoe's, coffee, tea, red
earth, china ware, diamonds, pearl, and
several other goods which I do not men∣tion,
because they are exported again; such
as wrought silks of <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Bengal,</HI> plain
and printed callicoes, all prohibited here
except the plain. Let the quantities of these
goods which are imported here, and which
are consum'd at home, be duly consider'd,
and let them be compared with the small
quantities of the like goods, or of any other
which any of our neighbouring nations im∣port,
and it will easily be decided, whether
<PB N="16" REF="330"/>
<HI>England</HI> may not justly be call'd the center
of the Commerce of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>It is true, that the <HI>Hollanders</HI> do exceed
us in some articles of Trade, which they
import in greater quantities than <HI>England,</HI>
as particularly,</P>
<P>1. In the quantity of iron from <HI>Sweden.</HI></P>
<P>2. Naval stores from the <HI>Baltic.</HI></P>
<P>3. Oyl and whole sinns from <HI>Greenland.</HI></P>
<P>4. Spices, and silks, and callicoes, from
the <HI>East Indies.</HI></P>
<P>5. Herrings from the coast of <HI>Scotland.</HI></P>
<P>6. Wine and brandy from <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>I believe, I do them justice in saying, that
except these six articles, they do not come
up to us in the quantity of any one im∣portation
whatsoever; and none of these
five articles are imported for their own con∣sumption,
but are exported again by them,
to all the other parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> where they
are able to dispose of them.</P>
<P>Two articles more, indeed, they import
in vast quantities, to their great loss and
expence, which however, blessed be God,
we do not want; but spare a great deal an∣nually
to them for their money, these are
corn and salt.</P>
<P>The first, they fetch from <HI>Dantzick</HI> and
from <HI>Great Britain.</HI></P>
<P>The last from <HI>Setubal,</HI> or St. <HI>Ubies</HI> near
<HI>Lisbon,</HI> in the K. of <HI>Portugal's</HI> dominions.
<PB N="17" REF="331"/>
But all the other goods they import as Mer∣chants,
and export them again, being, as it
may be said, only the carriers and brokers
for the rest of the World.</P>
<P>But all the importations I have mention'd
above, and abundance more, which are con∣sum'd
at home, are mingled with our own
produce and manufacture, and join together,
to make up the one Immense article, of which
I am speaking, call'd <HI>home trade;</HI> and thus
I have brought the whole discourse, which
might at first look like a digrssion, down
to the Tradesman, who is the man I am
talking to, and to our inland Trade, which
is the main subject of our discourse.</P>
<P>Not only these, but more of other kinds,
too many to enumerate, and some equally
considerable, from other parts, supply our
Tradesmens Shops, besides all the product
of our Colonies and Plantations, which are
an import equal to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> return of
Plate from <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> and which
I did not mention among the rest. Be∣cause</P>
<P>1.
They are the growth and produce of
our own Colonies, and so are to be rec∣koned,
as our own growth and produce,
as I have hinted before. And</P>
<P>2. Because great quantities of those goods
are exported again to other countries, to
the singular encrease of the wealth and com∣merce
of this Nation.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="332"/>
But as far as they are consum'd at home,
they mingle, I say, with our own growth,
and manufactures, help to store the ware∣houses,
and cellars of our Shop-Keepers, and
add to the immense greatness of our inland
Trade, and so still they come home to our
text.</P>

<P>All these, and an innumerable sort of name∣less
particulars more, are not only import∣ed,
but are imported for our own con∣sumption,
and consequently encrease our
Manufactures, and encrease our home Trade.</P>
<P>Nor are all these goods so immediately
made use of at home, as only to be pre∣sently
retailed out to the consumer; in
which case, they would not be of much
real benefit to the publick stock, and be on∣ly
a drain for our money, assisting the fo∣reign
Commerce, and causing the ballance
of Trade to run against us. But many of
these importations run thro' several parti∣cular
operations of Art, before they come
to use; and others are manufactured here, and
so employ our poor in great multitudes,
before they are fitted for use, and so are
many ways subservient to our home Trade,
<PB N="20" REF="334"/>
which is still the burthen of the song; for
example,
<Q>An account of foreign Materials, which are
used in, or actually are Manufactures of
<HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>1. The raw silks are dyed, spun, thrown,
and then woven into broad and narrow silks,
ribbons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and so lose their species, be∣come
an <HI>English</HI> Manufacture, and are
now a very great Manufacture too.</P>
<P>2. Cotton, Cotton-yarn, Hair, Grograms,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> allused and manufactur'd here at home;
and in several sorts of goods, chiefly Cottons,
Fustians, Dimities, and <HI>Manchester</HI> wares;
losing their species, and becoming <HI>English</HI>
Manufactures, as the silk.</P>
<P>3. Kid skins are all manufactured, and los∣ing
the very name of their kind, are sold in
gloves, and that only.</P>
<P>4. Elephants teeth chiefly made into
Combs, and Toys, become a Manufacture
of ivory.</P>
<P>5. Tin plates are manufactur'd by the tin
men, into all sorts of kitchen utensils, lan∣thorns,
watering-pots for gardens, canisters
for tea, funnels for chymneys, speaking trum∣pets,
and the like.</P>
<P>6. Black-latin is manufactur'd into all
kinds of woolline brass work; but especially
clock work, movements for watches, wheels,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="335"/>
7. Clapboard, Wainscots and Staves ma∣nufactur'd
into cabinet work, wainscotting;
and cooperage for making of casks.</P>
<P>8. Hemp manufactur'd by the rope-ma∣kers
into all kind of cordage, cables, and
rigging for ships.</P>
<P>9. <HI>Swedes</HI> iron and copper manufactur'd
into innumerable cutlery, and foundery,
and armoury wares, too many to dwell up∣on.</P>
<P>10. Sugars, very great quantities, which
they call muscavado's, or unpurg'd sugars,
are sold to the sugar-bakers or refiners,
where they pass an apparent operation call'd,
tho' falsly, sugar-baking, for it should be
call'd sugar-boiling, and are then sold to
the Grocers throughout <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>11. Beaver-hair, manufactur'd into hats.</P>
<P>12. <HI>Spanish</HI> wool mingl'd with our own,
and wrought into fine broad-cloths and drug∣gets,
call'd therefore <HI>Spanish</HI>-cloths and <HI>Spa∣nish</HI>-druggets.</P>
<P>13.
All the dye stuffs used in their pro∣per
places, for the dyeing all sorts of Goods,
which pass that operation, to sit them for
the Trade.</P>
<P>14. Oyl generally used in our woollen
Manufactures, and if not, then made up
into Soap.</P>
<P>15. Sulphur and Salt peter manufactured
again in the dangerous Trade of making
Gunpowder.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="336"/>
Thus the vast import of our Trade is not
properly for the immediate propagation of
luxury, and the expence of eating and drink∣ing,
tho' much goes that way too; but it is
again employ'd by many thousands of hands,
and gains to those hands a comfortable sub∣sistence,
to the propagating our Manufac∣ture,
employing our Poor, and furnishing
the Shops and Ware-houses of the retailer,
with Goods to the great encrease of our
home Trade.</P>
<P>This is a copious subject indeed; nor is it
easy to give a Description of it in the nar∣row
compass to which I am prescrib'd; It
would rather call for a large Volume in
Folio, however, I must do it in little as
well as I can.</P>
<P>Tho' the Trading Manufacturer is describ'd
in the close of our first part, to be only
such as are concern'd in the home Trade;
that is to say, in buying and selling among
our selves, exclusive of all that part, which
we call foreign correspondence; yet the
home Trade is not confin'd to the Goods
only made at home, or to the Goods only
consum'd at home. But the Trading Ma∣nufacturer
I am speaking of, is employ'd in
buying and selling, as well the Manufactures
made at home, and the Growth of the
Country at home, which are exported into
foreign Countries, and are bought by the
<PB N="23" REF="337"/>
Merchants for that purpose; as also in buy∣ing
and selling the Goods, which are the
Growth and Manufacture of foreign Coun∣tries;
and are imported here by the Mer∣chants,
but are consum'd at home, or made
use of at home, tho' it be for the fitting
other Goods for exportation.</P>
<P>Also many of the Goods imported from
abroad, and which are of the Growth and
Produce of the Country, from whence they
come, or the Manufacture of the people
of those Countries, are bought by our
Tradesmen of those Merchants, which
imported them, and sold again Nett as they
come, to other Merchants who export them
again to other Countries; so that tho' they
are exported again, yet passing thus thro'
the hands of some of our Trading Manufac∣turers,
they become on that account a
branch of our home Commerce, and are a
part of the general circulation of Trade
mention'd before. <HI>For example,</HI>
<Q><P>Dye stuffs and drugs of several sorts, as
I mention'd in the case of carriage, are
foreign Goods; and are bought of the
Merchants by the Dry-salter, who is an
<HI>English</HI> Trading Shopkeeper; and these
are sold again by the said Salter to other
Merchants to be exported again; and so
far as they pass thro' the hands of the
<PB N="24" REF="338"/>
said Salter, they become an article of our
home Trade for the time only; such are
our Salt-peter, Indico, Shumach, Gauls,
Logwood, Fustick, Brasileto, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> these
lose also their Appearance, suffering the
operation of grinding in a Mill, which
sometimes causes them to be bought and
sold several times before they come to be
exported.</P>
<P>Callicoe's, <HI>India</HI> Silks, Cotton, Wool,
Coffee, Tea, Pepper, and in general, al∣most
all the sorts of Goods imported from
the <HI>East-Indies,</HI> are thus bought and sold;
first from the Company, and secondly to
the Merchants, for the said Exportation;
and so they become an article of our
home Trade in the same manner; and
so of the rest.</P></Q></P>
<P>But with this short exception for the
buying and shipping off foreign Goods;
which in the language of the Custom-house
is call'd exporting by Certificate; they have
also another, <HI>viz.</HI> that they only pass thro'
a few hands; the rest of our Trade,
which may properly, and in a more li∣mited
restrain'd sense be call'd our home
Trade, consists in buying and selling such
Goods of any kind, and of all kind what∣soever,
as are consum'd at home; whether
manufactured at home or no, and whether
of our own Growth or no; as well what is im∣ported
for our use from abroad, as what
<PB N="25" REF="339"/>
is exported for other Countries of the Growth
or Manufacture of our Country, and Peo∣ple
at home; this I take to be a short, and yet
full account, of the Fund at least, of our
home Trade, and of what our <HI>English</HI>
Tradesmen are employ'd in and about.</P>
<P>The various manner, how these Goods
of so many sorts and kinds are brought to∣gether,
and brought to the several Markets
where they are sold; the manner in which
they pass from hand to hand, and from
place to place, which I call the circulation
of Trade, and the prodigious numbers of
People, which are by this means employ'd,
more than otherwise would be, are the con∣sequences
of that circulation, and which
are all articles by themselves, serving to add
to the great mass of Business call'd the <HI>En∣lish</HI>
home Trade.</P>
<P>Nor can I exclude that prodigy of Busi∣ness,
which tho' it is neither buying or sel∣ling,
making or manufacturing, planting or
reaping, yet is to be reckon'd a part of
Trade; and the People principally manag∣ing
it, are justly also call'd Tradesmen; I
mean the article of carriage, by Land and
by Sea, mention'd in my Introduction, but
promis'd there to be spoken to more at
large.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> By this article of carriage, which
I thus call a branch of Trade, I do
<PB N="26" REF="340"/>
not mean the Farmer's carrying his
corn from the Field to his Barn, or
from his Barn to the Market; nor the
Manufacturer carrying his wool to the
Spinner's, or his yarn from the Spin∣ner's
back to his own house; the Ba∣ker's
carrying about his bread, or the
Butcher and Farmer his provisions to
Market; no, tho' these are for sale;
nor do I reckon up an innumerable
number of smaller things carried from
place to place, such as Materials for
building and repairing, chalk, and lime,
and dung, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for manuring of Land,
and the like.</Q>
<P>But by this great article of carriage, I am
to be understood, to mean carriage for
Trade; in the capital articles of River and
Coast Navigation, whether of corn or any
other Goods; and the carriage of shopkeep∣ers
Goods, Manufactures and Materials
for Manufacturers, which are carry'd by stat∣ed
and usual Carriers for hire, and for the
particular assistance of Trade, either by
Cart, Waggon, or Horsepacks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>If just calculations were made of the im∣mense
sums of Money paid yearly in <HI>En∣gland</HI>
upon this one occasion, the numbers
of people, of cattle, and of ships which it
constantly employs, tho' no calculation could
be made from it, of the value of the Goods
<PB N="27" REF="341"/>
carried, especially by land carriage; yet it
might form some <HI>Ideas</HI> in the mind of the
reader, how prodigious a thing the Com∣merce
it self is; and of what importance
the people are consequently who carry it
on.</P>
<P>It is true, the carriage of some heavy
Goods, and in their often removes from
place to place, as well as from hand to hand,
before they come to the last consumer, a∣mounts
several times over the value of
the first cost; and several examples might
be given of this; as particularly that of
coals, salt, fish, tobacco, chalk, potters
and pipe-clay, and several other Goods of
the like sorts, which are bulky or heavy,
and are brought either by Sea or by Land∣carriage
a great way.</P>
<P>How the coals in several parts of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
where they are carried twenty to thir∣ty
miles and more, by waggons and horse∣carriage,
are bought for 2 <HI>s.</HI> or 4 <HI>s.</HI> per
Chaldron at the Pit, and are worth from
five to ten times that sum at the con∣sumer's,
merely by the expence of carriage,
I have mention'd already; it must be add∣ed,
that where they pay no tax, for the
Tax upon coals is only plac'd upon such
coals as are carried by Sea, the River
carried coals paying no part of it, though
in some places carried over large arms or
Bays of the Sea: thus in the case of the coals
<PB N="28" REF="342"/>
brought from the west part of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI>
from <HI>Wakesield,</HI> down the River <HI>Calder;</HI>
these coals are carry'd by Water to <HI>Selby;</HI>
and then they enter the open Sea, or arm
of the Sea, which we call the <HI>Humber;</HI> the
<HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Calder,</HI> tho' join'd, losing their
names. Thus they pass the said <HI>Hum∣ber,</HI>
where it is several miles broad, and
then enter the <HI>Ouse,</HI> and go up by the tide
to the City of <HI>York,</HI> and yet pay no duty;
these coals are bought at the Pit for at most
1 <HI>d.</HI> to 1 1/2. per Bushel, and yet at <HI>York,</HI> tho'
carried all the way by Water, are sold for
7 <HI>d.</HI> to 8 <HI>d.</HI> per Bushel at cheapest; and much
more sometimes.</P>
<P>The <HI>Newcastle</HI>-coals brought by Sea to
<HI>London,</HI> are bought at the Pit, or at the Steath,
which is the Wharf, for under 5 <HI>s.</HI> per Chal∣dron;
I suppose I speak with the most; but
when they come to <HI>London,</HI> are not deliver'd
to the consumcrs under from 25 to 30 <HI>s.</HI> per
Chaldron; and when they are a third time
loaded on board the Lighters in the <HI>Thames,</HI>
and carried thro' bridge, then loaded a fourth
time into the great west-country Barges, and
carry'd up the River, perhaps to <HI>Oxford,</HI> or
<HI>Abbington,</HI> and thence loaded a fifth time in
carts or waggons, and carried perhaps ten or
fifteen or twenty miles, to the last consumer;
by this time they are sometimes sold for 45 to
50 <HI>s.</HI> per Chaldron; so that the 5 <HI>s.</HI> first cost
including 5 <HI>s.</HI> tax is encreased to five times
<PB N="29" REF="343"/>
the prime cost; and because I have menti∣on'd
the frequent loading and unloading the
coals, 'tis necessary to explain it here once
for all, because it may give a light into the
nature of this River and Coast Commerce,
not in this thing only, but in many others.
These loadings are thus.</P>
<P>1. They are dug in the Pit a vast depth
in the Ground, sometimes fifty, sixty, to a
hundred sathom, and being loaded, for so
the Miners call it, into a great basket or Tub,
are drawn up by a wheel and horse, or hor∣ses,
(to the day that is to the light) to the top
of the shast or pit mouth, and there thrown
out upon the great heap to lye ready against
the Ships come into the Port to demand them.</P>
<P>2. They are then loaded again into a
great machine call'd a Waggon, which by
the means of an artificial road call'd a <HI>Wag∣gon-way,</HI>
goes with the help of but one
horse, and carries two Chaldron or more
at a time; and this sometimes three or four
miles to the nearest River or Water-carriage
they come at, and there they are either
thrown into or from a great store-house call'd
a <HI>Stethe,</HI> made so artificially, with one part
close to or hanging over the Water, that
the <HI>Lighters</HI> or <HI>Keels</HI> can come close to
or under it, and the coals be at once shot
out of the Waggon into the said Lighters,
which carry them to the Ships; which I
call the first loading upon the Water.</P>
<Q><PB N="30" REF="344"/>
<P>From the Lighters they are thrown by
hand into the Ships, which is the se∣cond
loading.</P>
<P>From the Ships being brought to <HI>London,</HI>
they are deliver'd by the <HI>Coal-Meeters</HI>
into Coal-lighters or Vessels in the River,
which is the third loading.</P>
<P>From those Lighters into the great West∣country
Barges, suppose for <HI>Oxford</HI> or
<HI>Abbington,</HI> which is the fourth load∣ing.</P>
<P>From those Barges they are loaded into
Carts and Waggons, to be carried to
the respective Country Towns to the
last consumer, which is the fifth load∣ing.</P></Q>
<P>But if you include the account of their digging
and loading into the Waggons, this makes
seven several removes, all which adds to the
expences, and heightens the price of Coals to
such a degree, as is mention'd above.</P>
<P>It is the like in several other Goods, too
many to repeat; such as Salt, Lead, Stone,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> As the workmanship adds to the
value of Manufactures, so the carriage to
that of heavy Goods; thus the Tobacco from
<HI>Virginia</HI> is bought thence at 1 <HI>d.</HI> per pound,
and yet by the freight, the lading first by Sloops
there, then unlading by Lighters here, and
Carts after, to what a rate does it raise the
Goods! not to mention the duties to the
Crown.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="345"/>
But from these bulky heavy articles, let
us come to that which is more particular∣ly
a branch of the great Commerce I am
speaking of, namely the carriage of Trades∣mens
Goods from place to place, for sale.</P>
<P>This article would seem very incredible
were it not to be demonstrated; the num∣bers
of carriers by waggon and by pack∣horses,
who are constantly going and com∣ing,
between this great City of <HI>London,</HI>
and almost all the Towns of note in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
from beyond <HI>Exeter</HI> 160 miles South∣west,
to <HI>Edinburgh</HI> 300 to 340 miles North;
and from <HI>West-Chester</HI> 150 miles North∣west,
to <HI>Norwich</HI> and <HI>Yarmouth</HI> 100 miles
East.</P>
<P>The number of vessels, horses and peo∣ple
employ'd in this carriage is incredible,
and the Money annually paid for this car∣riage
is so also; let some few articles explain
it in general.</P>
<P>It is computed by Authors of good Cre∣dit,
that the County of <HI>Warwick</HI> sends up
to <HI>London</HI> yearly, and to <HI>Sturbridge-Fair</HI>
19000 ton of Cheese.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and its adjacent
Lands, near 30000 ton of Cheese to <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and all other places.</P>
<P>The Counties of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> including <HI>Cam∣bridgeshire</HI>
and a small quantity from <HI>York,</HI>
fifty thousand firkins of Butter, each firkin
weighs 56 pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="346"/>
The quantity of Corn consum'd in the
City of <HI>London</HI> and parts adjacent is so great,
and the way of its being brought thither
so different, as shall be shewn in its
place, that no calculation can be made of
it, so I shall not attempt it: 'Tis our great
selicity in <HI>England,</HI> that how great and
grievous soever the Taxes have been, we
are not yet come to a <HI>Gabelle</HI> or tax up∣on
Corn, as is the case of <HI>Italy,</HI> and many
other Countries, and may in time be our
case, if Wars and publick Perplexities en∣crease
upon us. Were that our case, we had
been able exactly to calculate the quantity
of Corn brought to this great Market, and
to all the rest of the great Corn Markets
in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But it may suffice at present to observe,
that besides the prodigious quantity of Corn,
and Meal, and Malt, brought by Sea, and
by the navigation of the <HI>Thames,</HI> and other
Rivers; such as the <HI>Medway,</HI> the <HI>Lea,</HI> and
several smaller Rivers to <HI>London,</HI> the like of
which is not to be seen in the World; there
is also a very great quantity, especially of
Meal and Malt, brought by Land-carriage,
from the Counties of <HI>Surrey, Kent, Sussex,</HI>
and <HI>Hampshire,</HI> for the Wheat is carry'd by
Land even from beyond <HI>Winchester</HI> to <HI>Farn∣ham</HI>
Market, and from thence to the Mills a∣bout
<HI>Guildford,</HI> and all the Country adjoin∣ing,
and then to <HI>London</HI> by Water.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="347"/>
In like manner Wheat is brought from
<HI>Northamptonshire,</HI> nay from <HI>Harbro<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in <HI>Lei∣cestershire,</HI>
and from <HI>Bedford,</HI> to the great
Markets of <HI>Hempstead,</HI> S. <HI>Albans,</HI> and <HI>Hitch∣in,</HI>
and being then ground at innumerable
Mills (in the County of <HI>Hertford</HI> chiefly,
which is full of Mills,) is brought by Land-carriage
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>This vast carriage of Corn and Meal to
<HI>London,</HI> is a branch of Trade, and is to be
reckon'd as such, otherwise I should not men∣tion
it, having hinted, that I do not rec∣kon
the carriage of Corn to Market, as
an ordinary part of Trade: But this ar∣ticle
is a part of the great Carriage I am
speaking of, and 'tis observable, that there
are many Farmers, and others that are not
Farmers, who keep Teams of Horses on pur∣pose
to let them out, for the bringing of
Corn, and Meal, and Malt to <HI>London;</HI> and
generally these Carriages go back laden
with Coals, Grocery, Wine, Salt, Oil,
Iron, Cheese, and other heavy Goods for
Shop-Keepers and Tradesmen of the
Country, and it is a very great return they
make for the mere expence of this Car∣riage.</P>
<P>Here
I might branch out this discourse very
profitably, and very much for the benefit of
the <HI>English</HI> Tradesman, in giving an account
of the Corn-Trade, the Butter and Cheese-Trade,
and the Malting-Trade; three arti∣cles
<PB N="34" REF="348"/>
which employ so much of the Lands
of <HI>England,</HI> and such an innumerable num∣ber
of our People and Cattle, that they are,
and I believe justly so esteem'd, a quarter
part of the whole inland Commerce: But
this wou'd be a task so difficult, is a subject
so nice, so full of variety, and of useful
Instruction to the Tradesmen, as well as
to the landed Men, that unless I wou'd
handle it very superficially, which I de∣sire
not to be guilty of in any thing I
shall speak of in this Work, it wou'd be
the greatest folly imaginable to meddle with
it.</P>
<P>The parts of it are so many, the Chan∣nels
it runs in so differing and distant from
one another, and the People are employ'd
in it in so differing a manner, that it wou'd
take up a large Volume by it self.</P>
<P>It must suffice to say, that <HI>England</HI> and
<HI>Scotland,</HI> which are now prodigiously en∣creas'd
in the Product of Corn, and every
day more and more encreasing, do supply
a very great part of the Trading Countries,
I mean on the South and West Shores of
<HI>Europe,</HI> with Corn, whenever their Crops
fail, or that by Scarcity or War, or any o∣ther
means, the price in those Countries
makes it worth while to carry it to them.</P>
<P>It is very seldom but in some parts or
other the Harvest fails, differing Climates
and differing Soils make frequent deficiencies
<PB N="35" REF="349"/>
in Corn, drought starves them in <HI>Spain,</HI> Lo∣custs
devour 'em in <HI>Sicily,</HI> and on the coast of
<HI>Barbary;</HI> excessive Rains hurt 'em in <HI>France,</HI>
and especially Hail; and the like in <HI>Germany;</HI>
and as to <HI>Holland,</HI> their doors are always
open to receive Corn, having little, very lit∣tle
of their own; not enough, as a good
Author writing on that subject expresses it,
to feed their Cocks and Hens. Some or
other of these Markets seldom fail, and
<HI>England</HI> lying open by Sea to them all, 'tis
very seldom but we have a vent abroad.</P>
<P>If it happens otherwise, if plenty and a
good Harvest blesses all the Countries I speak
of, and they call for no Corn for <HI>France,
Spain, Portugal,</HI> or <HI>Italy,</HI> that Blessing which
makes the World smile, makes us mourn;
'tis a bad article for <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> that we
are, as it may be said, curs'd with Plenty.
In a word, our Product being more than
our consumption, and the Corn not find∣ing
a vent, the Farmer is ruin'd, the Land∣lord
can't be paid his Rent, the Lands can∣not
be till'd, so the poor are not employ'd;
a strange Paradox! the People starve by
having too much Bread.</P>
<P>As the Corn-Trade is os such consequence
to us, for the Shipping off the overplus, so
it is a very considerable Business in it self;
the principal People concern'd in it, as a
Trade, are, tho' very numerous indeed, yet
but of four Denominations.</P>
<LIST>
<PB N="36" REF="350"/>
<ITEM>I. Corn-Factors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Meal-Men.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Malsters.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Carriers.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I. Corn-Factors; these, as Corn is now
become a considerable article of Trade, as
well foreign Trade or Merchandize, as in∣land
Trade, are now exceeding numerous;
and tho' we had them at first only in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
yet now they are also in all the
great Corn-Markets and Ports where Corn
is exported thro' the whole Island of <HI>Bri∣tain,</HI>
and in all those Ports they generally
correspond with the Corn-Factors in <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>These
Corn-Factors in the Country ride
about among the Farmers, and buy the
Corn, even in the Barn before it is thresh'd,
nay, sometimes they buy it in the Field
standing, not only before it is reap'd,
but before it is ripe. This subtle business
is very profitable, for by this means, cun∣ningly
taking advantage of the Farmers by
letting them have Money before-hand,
which they, poor Men, often want, they buy
cheap when there is a prospect of Corn be∣ing
dear; yet sometimes they are mistaken
too, and are catch'd in their own snare; by
all which you will easily allow me, that
these are one of those sorts of Tradesmen,
who, as I said, (<HI>Chap. II.</HI>) ought not to be
<PB N="37" REF="351"/>
fools, and indeed they seldom are so; and
were they fam'd for their honesty, as much
as they generally are for their understanding
in business, they might boast of having
a very shining character.</P>
<P>II. Meal-Men; these generally live either
in <HI>London,</HI> or within thirty Miles of it,
that employment chiefly relating to the Mar∣kets
of <HI>London;</HI> they formerly were the
general buyers of Corn, that is to say,
Wheat and Rye, in all the great Markets
about <HI>London,</HI> or within thirty or forty
Miles of <HI>London,</HI> which Corn they used
to bring to the nearest Mills they could find
to the Market, and there have it ground,
and then sell the Meal to the Shopkeepers,
called Meal-men in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>But a few Years past has given a new
turn to this Trade; for now the Bakers in
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent, go to the
Markets themselves, and have cut out the
Shopkeeping Meal-men; so the Bakers are
the Meal-men, and sell the fine Flower to
private Families, as the Meal-men used to do;
and as the Bakers have cut out the Meal-shops
in <HI>London,</HI> so the Millers have cut
out the Mealmen in the Country; and
whereas they formerly only ground the
Corn for the Meal-men, they now scorn
that Trade, buy the Corn, and grind it for
themselves; so the Baker goes to the Mil∣ler
<PB N="38" REF="352"/>
for his Meal, and the Miller goes to
the Market for the Corn.</P>
<P>It is true, this is an anticipation in Trade,
and is against that stated wholesome rule
of Commerce, which I mention'd before,
<HI>viz.</HI> That Trade ought to pass thro' as
many hands as it can, and that the cir∣culation
of Trade, like that of the
Blood, is the life of the Commerce. But
I am not directing to what shou'd be, but
telling what is; 'tis certain, the Meal-men
are in a manner cut out of the Trade, both
in <HI>London</HI> and in the Country too, except
it be those Country Meal-men who send
Meal to <HI>London</HI> by Barges, from all the
Countries bordering on the <HI>Thames,</HI> or on
any navigable River running into the
<HI>Thames,</HI> West, and some about <HI>Chichester,
Arundel,</HI> and the coast of <HI>Sussex</HI> and <HI>Hamp∣shire,</HI>
who send Meal by Sea; and these are
a kind of Meal-Merchants, and have Fac∣tors
at <HI>London</HI> to sell it for them, either
at <HI>Queen-hith,</HI> the great Meal-Market of
<HI>England,</HI> or at other smaller Markets.</P>
<P>By this change of the Trade, the Mil∣lers,
especially in that part of <HI>England</HI> which
is near the <HI>Thames</HI> who in former times were
eseem'd People of a very mean Employ∣ment,
are now become Men of vast Busi∣ness;
and it is not an uncommon thing to
have Mills upon some of the large Rivers
<PB N="39" REF="353"/>
near the Town, which are let for three or
four hundred pounds a year rent.</P>
<P>III. Malsters; these are now no longer
Farmers, and as might be said, working
labouring People, as was formerly the case,
when the public expence of Beer and Ale,
and the number of Alc-houses was not so
great, but generally the mail considerable
Farmers malted their own Barley, especial∣ly
in the Towns and Countries; and from
whence they supplied <HI>London,</HI> and almost
every farm house of note.</P>
<P>As the demand for Malt encreas'd, those
Farmers found it for their purpose to make
more and larger quantities of Malt, than
the Barley they themselves sowed wou'd sup∣ply,
and so bought the Barley at the smal∣ler
Farms about them; till at length the
Market for Malt still encreasing, and the
profits likewise encouraging, they sought far
and near for Barley; and at this time the
Malting Trade at <HI>Ware, Hartford, Royston,
Hitchin,</HI> and other Towns on that side
of <HI>Hertfordshire,</HI> fetch their Barley twenty,
thirty, or forty Miles, and all the Barley they
can get out of the Counties of <HI>Essex, Cam∣bridge,
Bedford, Huntingdon,</HI> and even as far
as <HI>Suffolk,</HI> is little enough to supply them;
and the like it is at all the Malt-making
Towns upon the River of <HI>Thames,</HI> where
the Malt-Trade is carried on for supply of
<PB N="40" REF="354"/>
<HI>London,</HI> such as <HI>Kingston, Chertsey, Windsor,
High-Wickham, Reading, Wallingford, Ab∣bington,
Tame, Oxford,</HI> and all the Towns
adjacent; and at <HI>Abbington</HI> in particular they
have a Barley - Market, where you see
every Market - day four or five hundred
Carts and Waggons of Barley to be sold at
a time, standing in rows in the Market place,
besides the vast quantity carry'd directly to
the Malsters houses.</P>
<P>The Malt-Trade thus encreasing, it soon
came out of the hands of the Farmers; for
either the Farmers found so much Business,
and to so much advantage in the Malting
Trade, that they left off Ploughing, and put
off their Farms, sticking wholly to the Malt;
or other Men, encouraged by the apparent
advantage of the Malting Trade, set it up by
it self, and bought their Barley, as is said
above of the Farmers when their Malt Trade
first encreased, or both these together,
which is most probable; and thus Malting
became a Trade by it self.</P>
<P>Again, tho' the Farmers then generally
left off Malting in the manner as above;
yet they did not wholly throw themselves
out of the profit of the Trade, but hir'd the
making of their own Malt; that is, to put
out their Barley to the Malt-houses to be
made on their account; and this occasion'd
many Men to erect Malt-houses chiefly to
make Malt only for other people, at so
<PB N="41" REF="355"/>
much per Quarter, as they could agree;
and at intervals, if they wanted full em∣ploy,
then they made it for themselves: of
these I shall say more presently.</P>
<P>It is objected by some, that this Malting
or Malt-making is not a Trade, but a Manu∣facture,
and that the Malsters, therefore,
shou'd not be rank'd among the Tradesmen,
of whom this Work has all along been sup∣posed
to speak.</P>
<P>But my answer will reconcile this by the
help of two distinctions.</P>
<Q><P>1. We must distinguish between Trades∣men
that are Shopkeepers, and which
are properly spoken of in the former
part of this Work, and Tradesmen,
who tho' they are dealers, and that
perhaps as conisderably as the others,
yet by the course of their Business,
transact their Affairs in another man∣ner,
of whom there are a very great
variety, and whom we must distinguish
not in this Trade of Malting only,
but in several other articles of Business,
of which we may have occasion to
speak.</P>
<P>2. In this particular Trade of Malting,
we must distinguish between those Mal∣sters
who make their Malt themselves,
and sell it either at home or at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and who are very properly call'd
<PB N="42" REF="356"/>
Tradesmen, and those Malsters, who,
as above, are only working Malsters,
and make it for other Men, at a cer∣tain
price per Quarter, for the mere la∣bour
of the operation; these are indeed
Manufacturers of Malt, and with them
the Malt is a Manufacture and no more;
as in the City of <HI>London,</HI> there are
Goldsmiths who keep Shops, sell
wrought Plate, Rings, and several o∣ther
things of Silver and Gold, and buy
old Plate; and these are very justly cal∣led
Tradesmen, and distinguish'd as such
by the name of Goldsmiths; and there
are at the same time Plateworkers, who
Melt, Cast and Hammer up all sorts
of Plate and other valuable things of
Gold or Silver, and these are call'd
working Goldsmiths or Silversmiths,
and are very properly call'd Smiths,
for they are mere Manufactuers and
Workmen, and the Plate, as it comes
out of their hands, is a Manufacture,
and no more.</P></Q>
<P>These distinctions will set us right in our
judging of who are, and who are not to be
call'd Tradesmen in the sense of this dis∣course;
so that when we direct our Instruc∣tions
to the <HI>Complete Tradesman,</HI> we may
know who we are talking to, and who
not.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="357"/>
It is with, this distinction, that I menti∣on'd
the Corn-factors in the last article be∣fore
this as Tradesmen, tho' they keep no
Shops; and they must be mentioned again
here; because as the Malt-Trade is now be∣come
so great, there are great numbers
of those Factors who sell no other Grain
(for Malt is still a Grain) than Malt; and
are, as we may say, agents for the Malsters
who stay in the Country, and only send
up their Goods, and assistants to those Mal∣sters
who come up themselves.</P>
<P>The mentioning these Factors again here,
naturally brings me to observe a new way
of buying and selling of Corn, as well as
Malt, which is introduc'd by these Factors
a practice greatly encreas'd of late, tho' it is
an unlawful way of Dealing, and many
ways prejudicial to the Markets; and this
is buying of Corn by samples only: the
case is thus.</P>
<P>The Farmer that has perhaps twenty load
of Wheat in his Barn, rubs out only a few
handfulls of it with his hand, and puts it
into a little money bag, and with this sam∣ple,
as 'tis call'd, in his pocket, away he goes
to Market.</P>
<P>When he comes there, he stands with his
little bag in his hand at the particular
place where such business is done, and there
the Factors or Buyers come also; the Factor
looks on the sample, asks his price, bids, and
<PB N="44" REF="358"/>
then buys; and that not a sack or a load, but
the whole quantity; and away they go to∣gether
to the next Inn to adjust the bar∣gain.</P>
<P>This
adjusting the bargain is thus; The Fac∣tor
demands how much he has of the Corn,
he settles that at twenty load, more or less,
as the mow may come out; then how soon
he can have it, ready thresh'd, clean'd and
deliver'd, and the time is agreed on.</P>
<P>The Farmer inquires where he must de∣liver
it, which is generally agreed to be ei∣ther
to such or such Hoys or Barges, or Ves∣sels,
as the nearest navigation to the place;
or at such and such Mills, if it be Wheat,
as are nearest to be ground at; (this last is,
if the buyer acts for a Meal-man or Miller.)
The next demand is the payment, and that
is adjusted to be at the delivery, or per∣haps
the Factor will be so kind to the Far∣mer
as to bring it to his house, if not far
off; upon this the Factor gives earnest, and
so the whole barn, or stack, or mow of
Corn is sold at once; and not only so, but
'tis odds but the Factor deals with him ever
after by coming to his house, and so the
Farmer troubles the Market no more.</P>
<P>This kind of Trade is chiefly carried on in
those Market-Towns which are at a small
distance from <HI>London,</HI> or at least from the
River <HI>Thames;</HI> such as <HI>Rumford, Dartford,
Grayes, Rochester, Maidstone, Chelmsford,
<PB N="45" REF="359"/>
Malden, Colchester, Ipswich,</HI> and so down
on both sides the River to the <HI>Northsore∣land;</HI>
and particularly at <HI>Margate,</HI> and
<HI>Whitstaple,</HI> on one side; and to the coast
of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> and along the coast both ways
beyond, and likewise up the River; also</P>
<P>At these Markets you may see, that be∣sides
the Market-house where a small quan∣tity
of Corn perhaps is seen, the place men∣tioned
above, where the Farmers and Fac∣tors
meet is like a little exchange, where
all the rest of the Business is transacted, and
where an hundred times the quantity of
Corn is bought and sold, as appears in sacks
in the Market-house; it is thus in particu∣lar
at <HI>Grayes,</HI> and at <HI>Dartford;</HI> and tho
on a Market-day there are very few Wag∣gons
with Corn to be seen in the Market,
yet the Street or Market-place, nay, the
Towns and Inns are throng'd with Far∣mers,
and samples on one hand, and with
Meal-men, <HI>London</HI> - Bakers, Millers, and
Corn-Factors, and other Buyers on the other;
the rest of the Week you see the Waggons
and Carts continually coming all Night,
and all Day, laden with Corn of all sorts to be
deliver'd on board the Hays, where the Hoy∣men
stand ready to receive it, and general∣ly
to pay for it also; and thus a prodigious
Corn-Trade is manag'd in the Market, and
little or nothing to be seen of it.</P>
<P>Now tho' this is openly done, nor do I
<PB N="46" REF="360"/>
see it will be ever practicable to prevent it,
yet it must be acknowledg'd, that this is a
really clandestine Trade, utterly unlawful,
and may sometimes be very inconvenient, as
it opens the door to the fatal and forbid∣den
Trade of engrossing, regrating, forestal∣ling
the Markets, and the like, which in
cases of scarcity may be, and sometimes has
been very injurious to the public, and espe∣cially
to the poor.</P>
<P>It is also a great injury to the Markets
as well to the Market-Towns, in prevent∣ing
the concourse of People, and horses,
and carriage to the place, which affects the
whole Tsade of that Market, as is visible
in those Towns where it is practis'd to a
great degree; as also to the Market, as a
property; for the Markets of <HI>England</HI> are
srequently the particular Estates of private
Persons, and the Markets in Corporations
are generally the Estate and Property of the
Corporation as a body Politic.</P>
<P>But it is not our business here to discourse
of the Injustice in this part of Trade, but to
describe it, and give an account that it is
so. There are many branches of this Corn-Trade,
which vary as the circumstances of
time, and of public Affairs influence it; by
which frequent prohibitions, and restraints
are laid upon the Exportation, and some∣times
Limitations of the price: But these
things are too long for this place.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Principles and Subject of the
Home-Trade, about which our
Tradesmen are more particularly
employ'd.</HEAD>
<P>THE Introduction having frequently
led me from speaking of and to
the Tradesmen of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>
to the Trade it self, especially as it is ex∣plain'd
to mean the <HI>Home-Trade,</HI> exclusive
of the Merchandizing part of Business: I
am now of course to speak of the other
parts or branches of that Trade, not men∣rioned
in the said Introduction; and it seems
proper to dispatch these several branches
together, that our account of things may
not be confus'd.</P>
<P>The <HI>Home-Trade</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as is noted
already, may be understood to consist of
things produc'd at Home, or things im∣ported
from Abroad; and as all these gradu∣ally
come into the hands of the Trades∣man,
so they more particularly become
the subject of the <HI>Home-Trade:</HI> The Goods
imported from abroad are bought by the
Tradesman from the Merchant importer;
the Goods produc'd at home are, in like
<PB N="48" REF="362"/>
manner, bought from the Grower or first
Producer; such as Wool from the Grasier,
Corn from the Farmer, Metal from the
Miner, and the like; or from the Merchant
or Maker, such as 'Woollen Manufactures
from the Clothier, Cotton Manufactures
from the Maker, Leather from the Tanner,
Earthen-ware from the Potter, wrought
Iron from the Black-smith, wrought Plate
from the Silver-smith, <HI>and the like;</HI> and thus
these also become the subject of Trade,
and so employ the Tradesmen of whom I
have been speaking.</P>
<P>Of the Goods imported from abroad and
bought of the Merchant, I have spoken in
the Introduction. These foreign Importa∣tions
coming into the Shopkeeper's hands,
or into the hands of Manufacturers, who, as I
have said, are so far the Consumers, are
now no more to be treated as foreign, but
the branches of the general home Consump∣tion,
and in part are the support of the
Tradesmen of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>The next and chief article is our own
product or inland Goods in general, and
these, <HI>as above,</HI> are divided into two
heads.</P>
<Q><P>1. The mere product of NATURE, such as
are also mentioned before, <HI>viz.</HI> Wool,
Skins, Hides, Corn, Coals, Metals,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="363"/>
II. The product of ART, such as we more
particularly and properly call Manufac∣ture.</P></Q>
<P>Both these are the subject of Trade, and
the support of the Tradesmen of <HI>Great-Bri∣tain,</HI>
of whom I am speaking; and since 'tis
necessary to describe them more particular∣ly,
I shall do it so as that the Tradesman
may receive Instruction too in his business
from the description, and so make this part
of the Work useful to him, as a Trades∣man,
as well as the other. I begin with
the Manufactures.</P>
<P>The Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> are
so prodigious in quantity, that the variety
of kinds is scarce taken notice of; nay,
some have their thoughts so engross'd by
the Woollen and Clothing Manufacture,
that when you name the word Manufacture,
they wou'd understand nothing but the
Woollen Manufacture, they wou'd have it
be call'd THE <HI>Manufacture,</HI> as if there were
no Manufacture, or that nothing was to
be call'd a Manufacture, but what was made
of Wool; whereas <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> as we
shall see in its course, has her people em∣ploy'd
in many very useful Manufactures,
and that such as make very considerable
articles in our Commerce as well our home,
Trade as our foreign Trade, giving busi∣ness
to the Tradesman and to the Mer∣chant
<PB N="50" REF="364"/>
also, as it does likewise employment
and wages to the poor.</P>
<P>In giving an account of these Manufac∣tures
it will be very useful to the Tradesman
to observe, not only what the Manufactures
themselves are, their names and kinds, but
where they are principally made, and in what
part of the Country, that so the Tradesmen
dealing in those Goods may have at least
a general notion of the Manufacture it self,
what it is, how made, and where to en∣quire
after it.</P>
<P>But here, previous to the several species
of the Woollen Manufacture, there is a ne∣cessary
observation to be made relating to the
first and general operation of the thing call∣ed
Wool; however plain and easy the road
of Manufacturing may be, or rather appears
to be, I must let the Tradesmen know, that
the apparatus in general is in itself very
considerable, and almost equal to the Ma∣nufacture
itself; and that in order to under∣stand
the Manufacture, it is necessary to
understand the several things done in or∣der
to prepare the materials, and the many
hands those materials pass thro' before they
come to the finisher, or, as I may call him,
the Master Manufacturer who sends them to
Market, by whom they come to the Trades∣man
himself.</P>
<P>The Wool and the Oil mentioned in
our beginning, as the great principles of
<PB N="51" REF="365"/>
the Manufacture in general, are brought by
differing channels to the hands of the Ma∣nufacturer;
and indeed pass a long way in
the ordinary channel of Trade, before they
meet at the Clothier's house.</P>
<P>The OIL has already been mention'd, it
chiefly comes from <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> a City in the
gulph of <HI>Otranto</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> and in the King∣dom
of <HI>Naples,</HI> or from <HI>Seville,</HI> and <HI>Cadiz,</HI>
in <HI>Spain,</HI> and from <HI>Faro, Figuera, Lisbon,</HI> and
<HI>Oporto</HI> in <HI>Portugal;</HI> but the greatest quan∣tity
is that from <HI>Gallipoli;</HI> I need not add
that this is imported by the Merchant, bought
by the Tradesman, and sold to the Manu∣facturer.</P>
<P>The
WOOL has many Channels as well
from Abroad as at Home.</P>
<P>I. Wool from Abroad makes only two
Articles.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Spanish-wool,</HI> of which I need say no
more than as is said of the Oil, 'tis im∣ported
from <HI>Spain</HI> by the Merchant,
and chiefly from <HI>Bilboa,</HI> is bought by
the Tradesman, sold again to the
Clothier, being mostly used up with the
<HI>English</HI>-wool, and mixt together, the
<HI>Spanish</HI> being too fine, and short, to use
by itslf, except in some particular goods.</P>
<P>2. <HI>Irish-wool,</HI> this comes over by allow∣ance
settled by Parliament, and is only
admitted to be imported at the fol∣lowing
<PB N="52" REF="366"/>
Ports, <HI>viz.</HI> at <HI>Biddiford, Barn∣staple,
Minhead, Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Liverpool.</HI></P></Q>
<Q><P><HI>N. B.</HI> We have sometimes, and in small
quantities, a good sort of Wool from
<HI>Barbary,</HI> the <HI>African</HI> Wool being of
good substance, a long full staple, and
not very coarse.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> It might be noted, that if the
<HI>Spaniards</HI> were an industrious, diligent
People, and understood any thing of
Improvement, and especially of Ma∣nufacturing,
and wou'd furnish them∣selves
with this Wool of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and
mix it with their own, it wou'd work
as well together as could be desir'd,
and they might make as good a Ma∣nufacture
as our <HI>Spanish</HI>-Cloths; but
they have neither the art or the appli∣cation.</P></Q>
<P>Also we have sometimes Wool import∣ed
from <HI>Turkey</HI> and is called <HI>Caramania</HI>-Wool,
which is very good, but the quan∣tity
is but small.</P>
<P>3. The <HI>English-Wool,</HI> This is the main
article, the substance of the whole Manu∣facture,
and consequently the chief article
in all the Home Trade of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P>But we must not pass it over, that this
Wool takes a great many several turns
thro' a great many hands, and appears in
<PB N="53" REF="367"/>
many several Shapes, suffers a great ma∣ny
several Operations, and even alterations,
before it comes to the Manufacturer or
Clothier, and in those various turns of its
species, it may be said to be for some time
in the hands of the Tradesman, and is ma∣naged
as an article of the Home-Trade, and a
very considerable article too; tho' afterwards
it ceases to move in that channel, and be∣comes
a material in the hand of the Labou∣rer
or Manufacturer as you will see in its
order.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Wool itself being taken from
the Sheeps back, either by (the Sheerer) the
Farmer, or by the Fellmonger from the
Skin, the Creature being dead, becomes a
subject of Trade, and is either sold to the Sta∣pler,
that is the Wool-Merchant, and by him
to the Manufacturer, or is carried by the Far∣mer,
and Fellmonger, as is sometimes the
case, to the particular Counties where it
is consum'd.</P>
<P>These Staplers and Wool - dealers are
seatter'd all over the Kingdom, and are a
very important and considerable sort of
Tradesmen, being the first Tradesmen into
whose hands the said Wool comes for sale;
the principal Towns in <HI>England,</HI> where they
are found to be in any numbers together, are
in <HI>London,</HI> or <HI>Southwark</HI> rather, being prin∣cipally
in <HI>Barnaby-street,</HI> and the Town of
<HI>Blandford</HI> in <HI>Dorsetshire;</HI> there are also
<PB N="54" REF="368"/>
some in <HI>Norwich</HI> and in <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> and
<HI>Leicestershire a great many.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sturbridge-<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>air</HI> is famous for the great
quantity of Wool sold there, and which
goes beyond any other Fairs or Markets in
all the North or East part of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But wherever the Wool is carried, and
by whomsoever it is sold, this of course
brings it to the first part of its Manufactur∣ing,
and this consists of two operations.</P>
<Q><LIST>
<ITEM>1. Combing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Carding.</ITEM>
</LIST></Q>
<P>The Combers are a particular set of Peo∣ple,
and the combing a Trade by itself; the
carding on the other hand is chiefly done
by Workmen hired by the Clothiers them∣selves;
the Combers buy the Wool in the
Fleece, or in the Pack, and when it is comb∣ed,
put it on to the next operation on their
own account; the Carding is generally done
by hired servants as above; these operati∣ons
hand on the Wool to the next, which
is common to both, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Spining.</HI></P>
<P>But before it comes this length it re∣quires
a prodigious number of People, Hor∣ses,
and carriages (Carts or Waggons) to
carry it from place to place; for the People
of those Countries where the Wool is
grown, or taken as above, are not the Peo∣ple
who spin it into Yarn.</P>
<P>On the contrary, some whole Counties
and parts of Counties are employ'd in Spin∣ing,
<PB N="55" REF="369"/>
who see nothing of any Manufacture
among them, the mere Spining only ex∣cepted.</P>
<P>Thus
the Weavers of <HI>Norwich,</HI> and of
the parts adjacent, and the Weavers of <HI>Spit∣tlefields</HI>
in <HI>London,</HI> send exceeding great
quantities of Wool into remote Counties
to be spun, besides what they spin in both
those populous Counties of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and
<HI>Suffolk;</HI> particularly they employ almost the
whole Counties of <HI>Cambridge, Bedford,</HI>
and <HI>Hertford;</HI> and besides that, as if all this
part of <HI>England</HI> was not sufficient for them,
they send a very great quantity of Wool
one hundred and fifty Miles by Land-car∣riage
into the North, as far as <HI>Westmorland</HI>
to be spun, and the Yarn is brought back
in the same manner to <HI>London,</HI> and to
<HI>Norwich.</HI></P>
<P>This vast Consumption of Wool in <HI>Nor∣folk</HI>
and <HI>Suffolk</HI> is supply'd chiefly out of
<HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> a County famous for the large
breed of Sheep bred up for the supply of
the <HI>London</HI>-Markets, as the <HI>Western</HI>-Manu∣facturers
are supply'd from <HI>Leicestershire,</HI> of
which in its place.</P>
<P>Nor is all this sufficient still, but as if all
<HI>England</HI> was not able to spin sufficient to
the Manufactures a very great quantity of
Yarn ready spun, is brought from <HI>Ireland,</HI>
landed at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and brought from thence
<PB N="56" REF="370"/>
by Land-carriage to <HI>London,</HI> and then to
<HI>Norwich</HI> also.</P>
<P>The County of <HI>Essex,</HI> a large and exceed∣ingly
populous County, is chiefly taken up
with the great Manufacture of Bayes and
Perpets; the Consumption of Wool for this
Manufacture is chiefly bought of the Sta∣plers
in <HI>London;</HI> the sorting, oyling, comb∣ing,
or otherwise preparing the Wool, is the
work of the Master Manufacturer or Bay∣maker;
and the Yarn is generally spun
in the same County, the extent of it be∣ing
not less than between fifty and sixty
Miles square, and full of great and popu∣lous
Towns; such as <HI>Colchester, Braintree,
Cogshall, Chelmsford, Billerecay, Bishop∣stafford,
Saffron-walden, Waltham, Rum∣ford,</HI>
and <HI>innumerable</HI> smaller, but very po∣pulous
Villages, and in a word, the whole
Country full of People.</P>
<P>The Western part of <HI>England,</HI> superior
both in Manufactures, and in numbers
of People also, are neither to be supplied
either with Wool, or with Spining, among
themselves, notwithstanding two such articles
in both, as no other part of <HI>England</HI> can
come up to, no, not by a great deal. (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>1. Notwithstanding the innumerable
numbers of Sheep fed upon those al∣most
boundless Downs, and Plains in
the Counties of <HI>Dorset, Wilts, Glou∣cester,
<PB N="57" REF="371"/>
Somerset,</HI> and <HI>Hampshire,</HI>
where the multitudes, not of Sheep
only, but even of Flocks of Sheep, are
not to be reckon'd up; insomuch that
the People of <HI>Dorchester</HI> say, there
are six hundred thousand Sheep always
feeding within six Miles round that
one Town.</P>
<P>2. Notwithstanding the large and most po∣pulous
Counties of <HI>Wilts, Somerset,
Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> in which the
Manufacture being so exceeding great,
all the Women Inhabitants may be
supposed to be thoroughly employ'd
in spining the Yarn for them; and in
which Counties are, besides the popu∣lous
Cities of <HI>Excester, Salisbury, Wells,
Bath, Bristol,</HI> and <HI>Gloucester;</HI> I say, be∣sides
these the greatest Towns, and the
greatest number of them, that any o∣ther
part of the whole Kingdom of
<HI>Great-Britain</HI> can shew; some of which
excced even the great Towns of <HI>Leeds,
Wakesield, Sheffield,</HI> &amp;c. in the North;
such as, <HI>Taunton,</HI> Divizes, Tiverton,
Crediton, Bradsord, Trowbridge, West∣bury,
Froom, Stroud, Biddisord, Barn∣staple,
Dartmouth, Bridgewater, Min∣head,
Pool, Weymouth, Dorchester,
Blandford, Wimbourn, Sherborn, Ciren∣cester,
Honiton, Warminster, Tewks∣bury,
Tedbury, Stroud, Malmsbury,
<PB N="58" REF="372"/>
and abundance of others, too many to set
down; all which I mention, because those
that pretend to have calculated the num∣bers
of People employ'd in these four Coun∣ties,
assure me, that there are not so few
as a million of People constantly employ'd
there, in Spining and Weaving, for the
Woollen Manufacture only; that besides
the great Cities, Towns and Sea-ports men∣tion'd
above, there are not less than one hun∣dred
and twenty Market Towns, six large
Cities, and fifteen hundred Parishes, some
of which are exceeding full of People.</P>
<P>And yet notwithstanding all this, such is
the greatness of this prodigious Manufac∣ture,
that they are said to take yearly thirty
thousand packs of Wool, and twenty five
thousand packs of Yarn ready spun from
<HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, take a short view of the
middle part of <HI>England; Leicester,</HI> and <HI>Nor∣thampton,</HI>
and <HI>Warwickshires,</HI> having an in∣numerable
number of large Sheep, which,
as is said of <HI>Lincolnshire,</HI> are bred for the
<HI>London</HI> Markets, the Wool consequently is
of an exceeding long staple, and the finess
is known also to be extraordinary.</P>
<P>This Wool is brought every week, <HI>Tues∣day</HI>
and <HI>Friday,</HI> to the Market at <HI>Cirences∣ter,</HI>
on the edge of <HI>Gloucester</HI> and <HI>Wilts,</HI>
the quantity is suppos'd to be at least five
hundred packs of Wool per Week.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="373"/>
Here it is bought by the Wool-combers
and Carders of <HI>Tedbury, Malmsbury,</HI> and
the Towns on all that side of <HI>Wilts,</HI> and
<HI>Gloucester;</HI> besides what the Clothiers them∣selves
buy; These carry it out far and near
among the poor People of all the adjacent
Countries for the spining, and having made
the Yarn they supply that Manufacture as
far as <HI>Froom, Warminster</HI> and <HI>Taunton,</HI> and
thus the West Country is furnished.</P>
<P>The North requires another Inspection,
the rest of the <HI>Leicestershire</HI> Wool-Mer∣chants,
who do not bring their Wool South∣ward,
carry it forward to the North, to
<HI>Wakesield, Leeds,</HI> and <HI>Hallifax;</HI> here they
mix it with, and use it among the Northern
Wool, which is not esteem'd so fine.</P>
<P>Not forgetting, not with standing, that they
have a great deal of very fine Wool, and
of a good staple from the Woulds or Downs
in the East riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI> and from the
Bishoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> more especially the
Banks of the <HI>Tees,</HI> where for a long way, the
grounds are rich, and the Sheep thought
to be the largest in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Hither all the finest Wool of those Coun∣tries
is brought, and the coarser sort, and
the Scots Wool, which comes into <HI>Halli∣fax,</HI>
Rochdale, Bury, and the <HI>Manufacturing</HI>
Towns of <HI>Lancashire, Westmoreland,</HI> and
<HI>Cumberland</HI> is employ'd in the coarser Ma∣nufactures
of those Countrics, such as Ker∣sies,
<PB N="60" REF="374"/>
half-thicks, Yarn-stockings, Duffelds;
Ruggs, <HI>Turkey-work</HI> Chairs, and many o∣ther
useful things, which those Countries
abound in.</P>
<P>Thus you have in as few Words as may
be, a Scheme of the disposition of the Wool,
as it is the apparatus to the Woollen Manu∣facture,
as well before it comes to be spun
into the Yarn, as after.</P>
<P>It remains to give the Tradesman a like
view of the Manufacture itsef, when finish∣ed,
and made fit for the Market, that is to
say, for the Tradesmen, how they please to
dispose them afterwards, is a thing by it∣self.</P>
<P>The several Manufactures of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI>

<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> It is not to be understood, that
these Manufactures are all made, or only

<P>AS the Trade of <HI>England</HI> is exceeding

consirable Traders.</P>
<P>6. Brokers, and Buyers, and Sellers of
Cattle, Corn and other Provisions by
wholesale for other Men.</P></Q>
<P>These are the Men who carry on the
whole Trade of the Kingdom, and under
them almost all those whom we call labour∣ing
poor are maintain'd and employ'd.</P>
<P>1. The Farmer and Grasier, those, as a∣bove,
are not properly Tradesmen; they em∣ploy

Husbandmen, who Plow, Sow, Harvest
and Carry out to Market the first principles
of all Commerce, (<HI>viz.</HI>) the Provisions for
the subsistence of the whole, such as Corn
and Cattle, Bread and Flesh; the poor ser∣vants,
which are employ'd by these Farmers
<PB N="74" REF="388"/>
and Grasiers are numberless, and there is no
estimate can be made of them, as well Men∣servants
as Maid - servants, Dairy - maids,
House-maids, and maids for looking after
the Cows and Poultry, and the Families;
these I say, I do not call Tradesmen.</P>
<P>2. The Manufacturer and Handicraft or
Artist of every kind; I do not mean the
working People, tho' many and most of
them do work also, at least they are far from
being idle, yet these are not among my list
of Tradesmen; they are indeed the first
springs, the wheels in the whole move∣ment
of the whole Manufacturing; they buy
the Wool, put it out to spinning, and after
that to weaving, and under them employ and
subsist not many thousands only, but many
hundred thousands of poor People, whose
dependence is wholly upon it; and these
are they who follow the Manufacture so
well, so effectually, so fully, that they keep
up the goodness of the Manufactures to
their true standard and value, and to whose
judgment and care is owing the great Cre∣dit
and real Esteem of the <HI>English</HI>-woollen
Manufactures in foreign Parts, above all
the rival Manufactures, which are so often,
and have been so long attempted in other
Countries to their prejudice; yet these are
not Tradesmen.</P>
<P>The next is the true <HI>Tradesman, viz.</HI> the
Factor employ'd by the said Manufacturer,
who sells the Goods from the very first hand to
<PB N="75" REF="389"/>
the Retailers and Merchants, the first selling
them at home, and the last exporting them
abroad. These indeed are real Tradesmen,
and the chief of Tradesmen; and tho' they
are but few, compared to the other heads,
and are chiefly resident in <HI>London,</HI> yet they
correspond with all the Nation, and may be
said to be the most considerable both in
business, in credit, and in substance.</P>
<P>Lastly the <HI>Retailer,</HI> this is the last and
finishing agent of Trade: All Commerce
ends in the Consumption, and with the
consumer; in this number are included all
the Country Shop-Keepers in <HI>England,</HI>
whose number is not to be known, unless
somebody should be sent with <HI>Joab</HI> out to
number the People, which I hope will not
be attempted.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, in the Introduction to
this Work, how impossible it is to make
any just calculations, either of the magni∣tude
of our inland Trade, the number of
the Tradesmen, or the value and extent of
their Stocks, and the Commerce they drive;
nor shall I undertake the unequal task here:
But I shall give some little Specimens from
such particulars, as may be more easily come
at, by which at least it will appear, how
impracticable it is to make a regular and
exact Computation.</P>
<P>I also gave some hints from the prodigi∣ous
expence of Carriage only, which at∣tends
<PB N="76" REF="390"/>
the Commerce of this Island: But
that article is not sufficiently spoken to
there, nor was it intended to be so; you
will therefore have some farther light into
it under the present enquiry.</P>
<P>We have in <HI>England</HI> near ten thousand
Parishes, some indeed, and the most in num∣ber,
are but Villages, and thin of People:
But others again are very large and popu∣lous
Towns, throng'd with Inhabitants, be∣cause
full of business, and bigger than ma∣ny
Cities; I might name some smaller,
which are yet very populous, such as <HI>Ware,
Chelmsford, Kingston, Uxbridge,</HI> and seve∣ral
such as these.</P>
<P>There is hardly a Parish of all the ten
thousand but has some of these Retailers in
them, and that several. On the other hand
some, and that not a few, have many hun∣dreds,
nay, perhaps a thousand in a Parish, in
such great Parishes as those I have mention'd.</P>
<P>We are told that there are in the Parish
of <HI>Manchester</HI> above 60000 People, in that
of <HI>Hallifax</HI> 100000 Communicants, in
<HI>Sheffield</HI> 50000, in <HI>Yarmouth</HI> 20000, in
<HI>Froome</HI> 50000, and so in proportion in o∣ther
places.</P>
<P>We are told also there are ten Trading∣Towns
in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> the West - riding of
<HI>Torkshire,</HI> and the adjacent Country, which
have most of them not above one Parish,
and none above two, and in most of them
<PB N="77" REF="391"/>
the highest Magistrate is a Constable, and
yet have each of them more People than
the City of <HI>York,</HI> and some of them twen∣ty
times as much Trade; such are <HI>Warring∣ton,
Manchester, Macclesfield, Liverpool,
Hallifax, Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield, Don∣caster,
Huthersfield;</HI> in all these the num∣ber
of Shop-Keepers, Retailers, and such as
come under the proper denomination of
Tradesmen, are infinite, by which I mean
not to be calculated by any rule, or guest
at by any proportions.</P>
<P>There are abundance of other very popu∣lous
Trading and Manufacturing Towns in
<HI>England,</HI> which may have from two to four
or five Parishes, the number of whose Trades∣men,
as well wholesale as retail, is not to
be reckon'd up; such as <HI>Hull, Birmingham,
New Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne, Leicester, Notting∣ham,
Taun<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on, Reading, Plymouth, Ports∣mouth,
Rochester,</HI> and abundance more, too
many to name; and experienc'd Tradesman,
who I am just now conversing with upon
this Head, bids me set it down upon his
Credit, and that he will be oblig'd to De∣monstrate
it upon any just occasion, that
there are fixty thousand Tradesmen in the
particular denomination of a Tradesman as
here describ'd, within the County of <HI>Nor∣folk</HI>
only; and he adds, that he believes there
are not less than an hundred thousand, if I al∣low
those to be Tradesmen who are deal∣ers
<PB N="78" REF="392"/>
in Wool, in spun Yarn, and in the
Manufactures of Stuffs made all over that
County, and are not Makers, and several
Traders of other kind, all which I must ac∣knowledge
ought to be reckon'd Tradesmen.</P>
<P>If this is true, then there may be two mil∣lions
of Tradesmen, including their Ser∣vants,
Prentices and Journeymen in <HI>Great∣Britain;</HI>
for I have yet said nothing of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI>
where the number of Tradesmen are
very considerable also, and their Trade con∣siderable
too; but this number however I
take to be of the most.</P>
<P>Besides these, I have not yet reckon'd
those travelling Tradesmen who we call
<HI>Manchester-Men,</HI> and those who carry <HI>Leeds</HI>-Cloth,
Kersies and <HI>Yorkshire</HI>-cloth of all
sorts upon Horses all over <HI>Britain,</HI> who
are some of them very considerable Dealers,
and furnish the Shop-Keepers all over <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
with their Goods, without cutting or
retailing any thing. Also,</P>
<P>Besides those who travel and go from
House to House selling by retail, and who
are properly Pedlars, and call'd by that
name; many of which do also keep Shops
or Chambers, or Warehouses, in the adja∣cent
Market-Towns, and sell their Goods
in the Villages round. These all come un∣der
the title of Tradesmen; they are by some
call'd Petty-chapmen, and the number of
them is very great, tho' as some think not
<PB N="79" REF="393"/>
so great as they have formerly been, which
however is a question does not relate to
my present business.</P>
<P>Under these denominations the general
Commerce of this Kingdom is carried on,
the home made Manufactures dispers'd and
circulated, and the foreign Importations
handed about to the last consumer.</P>
<P>It is true, this Calculation makes a pro∣digious
number of People be employ'd in
Trade; and so no question there are, how
else should the Trade it self, which is so
immensely great, be carried on? and how
else should the supplying the whole Nation,
Men, Women and Children, with all sorts
of Provisions, Clothes, House-furniture, Eat∣ables
and Drinkables be managed?</P>
<P>There are also abundance of other People
who must still come into the list of Trades∣men,
besides those already nam'd, and who
are certainly Tradesmen. For example,
All our Brewers and Distillers, and the
Dealers in many things relating to them,
as the Hop-Merchants, Hoop and Stave∣Merchants
for their Cask, nay, the Iron∣Merchants
for their Iron-hoops; and to
join them together, all the Vintners, Inn∣holders,
Alehouse-Keepers, and that pro∣digiously
multiplied article of Strong-wa∣ter
Shops, these are all Tradesmen; and as
such, were it worth while, I might fill up
this Book with needful Instructions for
<PB N="80" REF="394"/>
their particula Government, and all little
enough; for how shou'd they be tyed up by
rules who are encouragers of the rest of man∣kind,
to live without rule or Government?</P>
<P>Yet these have the most need of Instruc∣tion:
However, as the Instruction to them,
and to such as them, regards rather their
morals and manners, than their manage∣ment
of business, I omit it here, that part
being not the business of this tract; besides,
who shou'd go about to direct or govern
those people, who, I say, are the ruin of all
the Nation, as to Government and ma∣nagement
of themselves?</P>
<P>These are a sort of People that indeed
not only live without morals, but that
Trade without method; they generally go on
like their Customers, and carry on their
Trade, as if they were always drunk; keep
no Books but their Slate, and no Pen and
Ink but their Chalk and their Tallies; they
live without rule, Trade without order,
they thrive by mere chance, as Customers
come in, and when they grow rich, 'tis by the
necessity of their affairs, the World reels in
upon them as their Customers reel out; they
live by the sins of the People, and they are
a collection of sinners against the People,
for they break almost all the known laws
of Government in the Nation.</P>
<P>Yet their number is prodigious great,
and they are hardly to be reckoned up; and
<PB N="81" REF="395"/>
we must admit them into the class of Trades∣men,
there is no remedy, for they buy and
fell, trade on this side, and that, and are
no Manufacturers on one hand or on the
other.</P>
<P>The Butchers are also Tradesmen, and
particularly that part of them of which we
have a great many in <HI>London,</HI> call'd car∣case
Butchers, that is to say, wholesale Butch∣ers,
who kill the meat in great quantities,
and fell it out to the Butchers in the out∣parts
and in the Villages and Towns near the
City; these are indeed the more considera∣able
of the kind, but the retail Butchers are
Tradesmen too, for they buy and sell con∣tinually.</P>
<P>Horse-coursers,
or Jockeys and Horse-deal∣ers,
are also Tradesmen, so are the buyers
and sellers of Cattle, whether fat or lean, I
mean such as act between the Breeder and
the Butcher; and between the Breeder and
the Feeder, of which there are great num∣bers
in <HI>England;</HI> some are called Sales-men,
some Cow-jobbers, some Dealers, some
Brokers, and many of them Factors; as par∣ticularly
the buyers of Cheese, Butter, Corn
and Malt are called Factors.</P>
<P>These and many more kinds of Dealers
may be called Tradesmen, tho' they keep
neither Shop or Ware-house, and of these
the number is beyond all account.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Trade in Liquors, as well Wine
as Beer, Ale and other Liquors,
and of the vast numbers of Peo∣ple,
and particularly of Trades∣men
that it employs.</HEAD>
<P>THE next considerable article of Trade
managed out of the class of Shop∣keeping
and Ware-house-Keeping, is the
sale of Liquors, which tho' not equally ne∣cessary
as the Corn- Trade, yet is perhaps
equally considerable, if not superior to it.
The last Chapter allows the Vintners, Vic∣tuallers,
Inn-Keepers, Brandy-shops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
to be Tradesmen, and allows me to rank
them accordingly. I must now enquire a
little into the substance they deal in, which
is a considerable branch of Trade, and
the materials are all furnish'd by Trade,
either domestick or foreign; this Trade
in Liquors is to be distinguish'd into five
particular heads.</P>
<LIST>

<ITEM>Beer and Ale.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Brandy and Spirits.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Cyder and Perry.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Vinegar.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="83" REF="397"/>
The Wine Trade is wholly an Importati∣on,
being not only the substance of a fo∣reign
Product, but wholly of foreign o∣peration.</P>
<P>The <HI>Brandy</HI> and <HI>Spirits</HI> are of a mixt ori∣ginal,
and are partly home Product, and
partly foreign; the first is the Product of the
Grape, and the latter of the Malt.</P>
<P><HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> is wholly a home product,
being brewed intirely from Malt of <HI>En∣glish</HI>
growth.</P>
<P><HI>Cyder</HI> is the like, being drawn by pressing
from Apples and Pears all growing in <HI>En∣gland,</HI>
and principally in the South parts,
there being no considerable quantity of
Fruit growing North by Trent.</P>
<P><HI>Vinegar,</HI> as now used, is wholly of <HI>En∣glish</HI>
Produce, being made of Malt by E∣bullition
and Fermentation.</P>
<P>The Wine-trade, tho' it is an Importation,
is a very considerable article in Trade; the
magnitude of it is to be calculated by the
Custom-house Accounts, and may be seen
or rather guest at by the following Account
of the Importation of all sorts of Wine
in the year 1721, as it stands in our Custom∣house
Books for the Port of <HI>London</HI> on∣ly.</P>

</LIST></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> 5000 Ton of Brandy is much too
little.</P>
<P>These quantities amount to a very great
value, and being imported in one year,
shews us the magnitude of the Trade; the
quantity too being encreased, if common
same may be believed, by some mixtures they
receive here to the scandal of the Trades∣men
concerned in it.</P>
<P>Again it is to be noted, that as this is for
the City of <HI>London</HI> only, the Importation
of the same Wines, in all the other parts
of <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> is exceedingly encreas'd
since that time, and if we may believe the
common opinion, goes on encreasing <HI>in a de∣gree
hardly to be guest at.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="399"/>
The first value of these Wines in the
Countries from whence they come is not
great, in comparison to the value when
they come to the pint pot, as they call it,
that is to the Retailer. But the duties of
Importation, the freight to the Ships, the
expences attending it, the landing, the ma∣naging,
housing, carrying from place to
place, Cellerage, Cooperage, and the like;
these put all together make the value of this
Trade, reckoning it at the rate to the last
consumer, come to above two Millions
sterling <HI>per annum.</HI> For example,</P>
<P>Take the usual Tavern rate of <HI>Spanish</HI>
and <HI>Portugal</HI> wine to be 20 pence <HI>per</HI> quart,
this amounts to 40 pounds <HI>per</HI> Pipe; if we
import 60000 Pipes of <HI>Spanish</HI> and <HI>Portu∣guese</HI>
Wines, and of Brandy in a Year; these
cast up together, and 'tis plain I do not
over reckon the quantity, amount to two
millions four hundred thousand pounds ster∣ling;
besides that all the <HI>French</HI> Wine, the
Canary and the Brandy are sold much dear∣er,
but take them together it is an im∣mense
sum.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the rate of 20 pence
<HI>per</HI> quart is the lowest price of Wines as
retailed in the Taverns; all the Wines call'd
<HI>Canary, Rhenish,</HI> old <HI>Hock, Moselle, French</HI>
and <HI>Florence</HI> Wines, are sold at higher rates,
from 2<HI>s.</HI> to 6<HI>s.</HI> and 7<HI>s. per</HI> quart; so that I
take the estimation upon the lowest value
<PB N="86" REF="400"/>
of the sale of Wine in <HI>England,</HI> to a∣mount
to 2514824<HI>l.</HI> 6<HI>s.</HI> o <HI>d.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner I rate the quantity, as ap∣pears
above, much under what is every Year
imported; so that I cannot be taxed with
a false Computation, if I insist that the va∣lue
of the Wines sold in <HI>Great-Britain</HI> a∣mounts
to three millions <HI>per</HI> annum.</P>
<P>As the quantity of Wine is thus great,
the number of people (Tradesmen) who are
employed in buying, selling, carrying and
disposing this vast quantity of Wines, are
also great in Proportion; and there is so just
a connection between the quantity of
Goods in Trade, and the number of Trades∣men
managing and carrying on the Trade,
that I know no better way to form an Idea
of one, than by a just estimate of the other.</P>
<P>When we see a vast Circulation, a pro∣digious
Importation, and know the mighty
Consumption of the Goods, it is most na∣tural
to conclude, there is a number of Peo∣ple
equal to the Employment employ'd in
the vent of them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Beer</HI> and <HI>Ale</HI> is the next clause in
the Article of Liquors consum'd in <HI>Eng∣land;</HI>
the gross quantity brew'd in <HI>Great∣Britain</HI>
is not easily calculated; because the
excise is no rule to judge it by, great quan∣tities
being brewed which are not for sale,
and consequently pay no excise; but as the
quantity brewed for sale is only concerned
<PB N="87" REF="401"/>
in the case before us, namely the judging of
the numbers of Tradesmen (that is publick
House-Keepers) employ'd in the venting and
disposing of it, so a guess may be made.</P>
<P>The numbers of Ale-houses and Inn-Keep∣ers
in <HI>England</HI> are said by ordinary com∣putation
to be above 200000; and indeed I
believe that calculation to be very much
within compass; especially if all those Ta∣verns,
who likewise sell Malt Liquors, are
taken into the number.</P>
<P>The quantity of Liquors these houses dis∣pose
of must be prodigious great; especial∣ly
if we consider the excessive draft, which
some of those Publick houses have; particu∣larly
in this City, and in some other Towns
of great concourse of People, Houses on the
great Roads, in Sea-port Towns, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and
the like, of distilled Spirits.</P>
<P>But the best calculation of the quantity of
drink brew'd, is to be taken from the quan∣tity
of Malt made; since all the Malt, ex∣cept
a very small quantity exported, is ei∣ther
brew'd into Beer and Ale, distilled
into Spirits, or fermented into Vinegar.
Now the quantity of Malt is thus to be
stated. The Malt-tax before <HI>Scotland</HI> came
in to pay their Proportion, amounted one
Year to 660000 <HI>l.</HI> and it is generally now
given for 600000, that is to say, to bring
in so much clear of the Collection.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="402"/>
If then it brings in 660000 pounds in∣cluding
the charge of collecting, the
quantity is easily computed; for the duty
being six-pence <HI>per</HI> Bushel, or four shillings
<HI>per</HI> quarter, the question is, how many six∣pences
there are in six hundred and sixty
thousand pound; there being just forty six∣pences
in twenty shillings, or a pound, it is
easily cast up, <HI>viz.</HI> that there is twenty six
millions four hundred thousand six-pences,
and consequently, just so many Bushels of
Malt made in <HI>England,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI>
came in to pay the same Tax with us. But
then here is not any allowance for the esta∣blishment,
as they call it, of the Officers
Sallaries in Collecting, all which is paid out
of the Duty, and consequently so much more
Malt made to pay it.</P>
<P>The sum of the account then is, that
there is twenty six millions four hundred
thousand Bushels, or three millions three
hundred thousand Quarters of Malt made
in <HI>England</HI> in a Year, besides so much as
pays the Officers Sallaries, that collect it,
and incident charges, which is a very con∣siderable
article also.</P>
<P>It is true, they tell us there is a very great
quantity of this Malt distill'd into Spirits,
and also fermented as above into Vinegar;
but of all this I do not find they pretend
to above 300000 quarters; so that the Beer
and Ale must be found to make up the rest,
<PB N="89" REF="403"/>
which makes the brew'd part alone to be
three millions of Quarters.</P>
<P>In the strong Beer brewing they calculate
ordinarily three barrels upon a quarter, so
that if there are three millions of quarters
brew'd, it must be supposed to make nine
millions of Barrels of strong Beer, supposing
no small Beer to be made; but as a very
great quantity of small Beer is also brew'd
for and by small Families, the number of
the whole must be prodigiously greater, tho'
not all of strong Beer; if then such an im∣mense
quantity of Malt is brew'd and distill'd,
what a prodigious number of Tradesmen
of all sorts must be employ'd in venting,
(that is) in retailing this Beer and Ale?</P>
<P>This leads me of course to enquire into
the other branches of our Liquid Trade,
which occasions also a very great business,
such as,</P>
<P>1. Distilling, a new Trade in <HI>England,</HI> is
encreas'd to a prodigious degree, by an acci∣dent
in our Commerce, which was the Pro∣hibition
of Brandy from <HI>France;</HI> not that
our drinking of Brandy and Spirits is so
very much encreas'd: But upon the raising
the price of foreign Brandy, first by an ab∣solute
Prohibition, and then by a Duty of
two and fifty pound <HI>per</HI> Ton upon the Im∣portation,
the dearness occasion'd the stop
to the Consumption, and this encourag'd
the Distilling Trade at home, and put
<PB N="90" REF="404"/>
the Distillers upon exerting their skill to
such a degree, as we see it raised to at this
time; in which they are come to such Per∣fection,
that the ordinary People are now
so very well satisfied with their Malt Spirits,
and especially with their new Compositions,
that they do not seek <HI>French</HI>-Brandy in
such a manner as they formerly did.</P>
<P>It is most certain that in the Years 1687
and 1688 when the Trade with <HI>France</HI> was
open, and the duty paid upon the Importa∣tion
of Brandy was but nine pound <HI>per</HI> Ton,
there was imported and consequently con∣sum'd
in this Nation from <HI>France</HI> in one
Year from 9000 to 11000 Ton of Brandy;
a quantity, which were it imported now,
wou'd be an expence almost equal to the
common nett charge of all the Liquors
drank in <HI>England</HI> put together, I mean
clear of Excise: for example,</P>
<P>Suppose the quantity at a medium of
Years to amount to 10000 Ton in a Year,
and suppose this Brandy to amount in <HI>France</HI>
but to 10 pound <HI>per</HI> Ton, let us see the
value.</P>

<P>We find since these Prohibitions very
great quantities of Brandy run by the arts
<PB N="91" REF="405"/>
of Clandestine Traders; but even that
quantity is now much abated, except in the
North parts and West parts, since the Dis∣tillers
have found out a way to hit the
palate of the Poor, by their new fashion'd
compound Waters call'd <HI>Geneva;</HI> so that
the common People seem not to value the
<HI>French</HI>-Brandy as usual, and even not to
desire it.</P>
<P>That this Distilling Trade, as thus im∣proved
and encreased, adds exceedingly to
the numbers of our Tradesmen, and has
even erected several new species of Traders,
which were little or not at all known or
understood before, I need go no farther for
a proof of, than an account laid before
the House of Commons the very last Year
1726 in behalf of the Distillers, and to
shew the House how useful they were to
the publick; in which account, to make it
appear that they ought to be encouraged,
and the Trade preserved and nourished by
the Government, as a thing upon which
the publick prosperity very much depended,
they offered the following heads to the
Parliament's consideration.</P>

<ITEM>I. That the Distillers in and about <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
only, consum'd annually 200000
quarters of Malt, the Growth of our
own Country.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That besides this, they consume a
<PB N="92" REF="406"/>
very great quantity of Melasses, the
Product of our own Colonies, which
ought to be esteem'd our own Pro∣duce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. That besides Malt and Melasses, they
consumed from 10 to 15000 hogsheads
of Cyder every Year, and sometimes
more, besides a great quantity of damag∣ed
Wines, which would otherwise by
Act of Parliament be stav'd and spilt.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. They insisted that by the Consump∣tion
of Malt they employ'd above
100000 Acres of Land; this they al∣ledg'd
was true, because the Malt they
used being of an inferior quality, the
Lands it generally grew upon were
poor, and might be supposed not to
yield above 2 quarters upon an Acre.
<HI>N. B.</HI> It added to the merit of
this Trade, that it employ'd and oc∣casion'd
the cultivating so much
Land of that kind that would other∣wise
lye waste and until'd; also
that the Cattle employ'd in the Hus∣bandry
of the Land, and in the
Carriage of the said Malt from place
to place, besides the Water Carri∣age,
the Horses so employ'd must con∣sume
the Growth of many thousands
of Acres more.</ITEM>
<ITEM>V. They made it appear also, that they paid
in the bare Excise of the Liquors, thus
<PB N="93" REF="407"/>
distill'd, above an hundred thousand
pounds <HI>per annum</HI> to the Govern∣ment,
besides 200000 six-pences, which
is 5000 <HI>l.</HI> a year by the excise upon
the Malt, and besides the duty upon
Coals, the excise upon the Cyder and
the Custom of the Melasses.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These were the Allegations brought in
by the Distillers to shew to the Parliament
what useful People they were, how necessa∣ry
in the Common-wealth, how assistant
to the Government, in paying such great
sums to the publick Funds and the like.</P>
<P>And all these arguments serve in their
turn, to shew what numbers of Tradesmen
they have set up, what a great share of bu∣siness
they supply, what stocks, what poor
People they employ; and so it brings them
down to the present purpose.</P>
<P>It is true, that these Liqours are sold as
<HI>Addenda</HI> to other Trades, by the Chandlers,
Grocers, Inn-Keepers, Victuallers, and the
like; But let us cast our Eyes about us, and
in the Streets of <HI>London,</HI> and parts adjacent,
we may see a prodigious number of Shop∣keepers
whose business is wholly and solely
the selling of Spirits and Strong-waters, as we
call them, and nothing else; and I am told
there are in <HI>England</HI> some thousands of
such, more than was ever known before.</P>
<P>I must confess I should add here, that
the Advice to the Complete Tradesmen
<PB N="94" REF="408"/>
ought to have bestowed a little pains upon
these Gentlemen call'd Strong-water Men,
whose share in ruining the Peoples Morals,
as well as their Health, is too great, not to
require that they shou'd be animadverted
upon; let them take this gentle hint, they
know how to reform it.</P>
<P>But to bring it home to the present pur∣pose,
'tis evident to common observation,
that these Additions to the Trade in Li∣quors
are not trifles in the inland Com∣merce
of the Nation; and 'tis upon that
Foundation, that these Calculations are
made.</P>
<P>The Cyder Trade may perhaps be thought
a trifle, too mean to mention here; but I shall
put the Tradesmen in mind, that thro'
several Counties in <HI>England</HI> Cyder is, at
least for many Miles together, the common
draft of the Peoples drink; and that even
in their Publick-houses, there are no Malt
Liquors sold at all, and in others but very
little, as I can testifie of my own knowledge,
in the Shires of <HI>Worcester, Gloucester</HI> and
<HI>Hereford,</HI> and the like in <HI>Devonshire</HI> and
<HI>Somersetshire;</HI> from whence they tell us
they ship off twenty thousand hogsheads of
Cyder a Year to <HI>London,</HI> as is mentioned
above, so that Cyder, as a Trade, is far from
being inconsiderable.</P>
<P>All these articles, however trifling in them∣selves,
become considerable in the case be∣fore
<PB N="95" REF="409"/>
us, namely, that as they pass thro' many
hands, between the Growth and the Con∣sumption,
and go thro' some particular O∣perations
in the passage, they by that means
are a medium of Commerce, and add a
very great number to the general mass of
Tradesmen; such as to whom these two
Volumes are addressed, and especially to
those Tradesmen, who, as I said above, do
not come into the class of Shop-Keepers or
Ware-house keepers.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here, and indeed it wou'd
very well take up a whole Chapter, to give
some particular Instructions to those Trades∣men
I call Publick-house-Keepers, Vint∣ners,
Victuallers, Inn-Keepers and the like;
how they shou'd carry on their Trades like
Men of business, and perhaps, in the end,
not less to the advantage of their Families,
without prompting the Pot and the Glass, and
as the Text calls it, putting the Bottle to
their Neighbour's Nose, in a gross and scan∣dalous
manner, as is generally the practice;
making themselves Brokers to the <HI>Devil,</HI>
and tempters to Vice, merely for the getting
two-pence or three-pence, or perhaps six∣pence
extraordinary spent in their house;
I think I need not explain my self, the
ordinary Practice of those People, and the
Custom of their houses (those Tabernacles
of <HI>Bacchus</HI>) describe it too plainly, and I
shall speak of it by itself.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="410"/>
This makes the name of an Ale-house a
scandal, and the very Employment, which
wou'd otherwise be as reputable as other
Trades, is placed under License, as if it was
needful to keep them under the awe of the
Magistrate, and keep a check upon them,
that they might take better care of their
conduct, on the pain of having their Li∣censes
taken from them, and their Shops, as
we may say, shut up.</P>
<P>That a Victualler or Ale-house-Keeper
may be a very honest Tradesman is cer∣tainly
true; and I might give an account
of several within my own knowledge of
the World that are so; 'tis a disaster to them,
however it came to pass, to be so stated in
the World as to be engaged in an Employ∣ment
that subjects them to reproach, and
that implies a Crime even in the necessity
of carrying it on; but with a careful and
circumspect management, how easy is it
for them to establish a Reputation for a
quiet, calm, modest and well govern'd house;
and to found that Reputation upon the foot
of a just, exact and regular conduct in the
management of their business, let the na∣ture
of it be what it will?</P>
<P>I have seen some Inn-Keepers in particu∣lar,
manage their business with all the ex∣actness
of right and thorough bred Trades∣men,
keep their Houses, their Stables, their
Cellars, their Books, all with such care,
<PB N="97" REF="411"/>
such constant Application, such regular Dis∣positions
of things, one apart from ano∣ther,
that there has not been the least dis∣order
about them.</P>
<P>Many of these have large Farms upon
their hands dependent upon their Inns,
and some the Post-house; and that too, where
they have had a large branch in their hands,
and several by-bags and by-roads to direct,
and to keep the accounts of, yet do all
with the utmost readiness, and perhaps, be
their own Brewers also at the same time.</P>
<P>Will any one deny that these are to be
call'd Tradesmen? 'tis apparent that they are
not only Tradesmen, but some of the most
significant Tradesmen that bear that name;
and this, especically when they come to
have had extraordinary business, as is often
the case.</P>
<P>But it must be allow'd, that together with
these sober, grave and substantial Trades∣men,
there are abundance of scoundrel, sor∣ry,
griping, sharping Fellows, who neither
merit the name or the character; and that
these are embark'd in the destroying the
morals of the Nation, and the health and
livelyhood of the People, and to them a
Chapter of advice wou'd have been very
seasonable; but it is enough to tell such,
they are the reproach of the employment,
which but for their ill conduct▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ight be
<PB N="98" REF="412"/>
as reputable, as honest, and as free from
vices as any other employment.</P>
<P>I have heard much of the excessive drink∣ing
among the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Germans,</HI>
and especially in the Provinces of <HI>Westpha∣lia</HI>
and the Lower-<HI>Saxony;</HI> where they Brew
great quantities of Beer, and Mum, and have
plenty of Wine besides: But I believe I
may venture to challenge all the World to
shew the like quantity of Beer, and Ale, and
Wine, and Cyder, and Brandy, Arrack and
Geneva, and other Strong-waters, consum'd
in so narrow a compass of Land, or among
an equal number of People, as is now in
this our Country of <HI>England;</HI> nor is it
possible there can be a like number of
Tradesmen employ'd in the Management.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>Rostock,</HI> in the Duke of
<HI>Mecklemburgh</HI>'s Country, is famous for its
Brewery, and for the great quantity of Beer
they Brew there, and export to other Coun∣tries;
and it is indeed the principal Trade
of the whole Port; yet I am inform'd
that there may be found two Brewing∣offices
in <HI>London,</HI> which Brew more Beer
than all that City; and if it is true, as I be∣lieve
it is, that there are two Brewers in
<HI>London</HI> who Brew each of them 1000 Bar∣rels
a Week, which makes 104000 Barrels
a Year, I believe <HI>Rostock</HI> cannot go be∣yond
it.</P>
<P>It is not much to the purpose here to
<PB N="99" REF="413"/>
cnter into the particular proportions, be∣tween
the Beer and Ale, and that of Bran∣dy
and Strong-waters, and the Persons em∣ploy'd
in selling, venting and putting off
those Liquors, the number of the first bear∣ing
no proportion to the numbers of the
last, except in <HI>London</HI> only; but it must of
necessity be very great.</P>
<P>Thus we see the Foundation laid, on
which to raise an estimate of the numbers
of the Tradesmen in this Kingdom; and
really if all the schools of <HI>Bacchus,</HI> all the
Houses that sell Liquors, and entertain loose
and drunken People of all kinds, are to be
reckon'd among the honest Tradesmen, as
I do not see it can be otherwise; we must
allow the Trade to be exceeding great, and
the Tradesmen multiplying every Day.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Luxury and Extravagancies of
the Age becoming Virtues in Com∣merce,

<P>I Might add to the Victualling and Drink∣ing
Trade all the several Trades em∣ploy'd,
in the Vanity, Gaiety and Luxu∣ry
<PB N="100" REF="414"/>
of the Age, which are now become
such eminent branches of our Commerce,
that to make what we call sumptuary
Laws, for restraining Habits, Clothes,
Equipages and expensive customs, wou'd be
one of the greatest Invasions of our Trade
that could possibly be made, and wou'd
ruin thousands of Families: <HI>For Exam∣ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>:</HI></P>
<P>Suppose
an Act of Parliament were
to pass to prohibit the wearing of Pe∣rukes,
an extravagance which no Nation
ever run into like this, except the <HI>French:</HI>
But shou'd such a Law pass, how many
thousand Hair-Merchants, Periwig-makers
and their Dependances must sink, want Em∣ployment,
and be undone? the like might
be said of several other things.</P>
<P>Suppose a like Law shou'd pass against
wearing Silver or Gold either in Buttons,
or Lace, embroidery, or any other way, as
it was (before the Union) in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and
as during the late War, was strictly enjoin'd
in <HI>France;</HI> but how many Silver and Gold-wire-Drawers,
Embroiderers, Lace-makers,
and Lace-sellers would lose their Employ∣ments,
shut up Shop, and be undone? and
so of other Employments.</P>
<P>Suppose publick calamities shou'd reduce
our Pride to such a degree, as that no Bone∣lace
shou'd be allow'd to be worn in all
his Majesty's Dominions, what a blow wou'd
<PB N="101" REF="415"/>
it be to the Employment of the Poor in
those Counties, where so many thousands
of poor People gain their Bread by that Ma∣nufacture?
and the like of many other parts
of the Ladies Dresses, which however need∣less,
and however the mere effect of Pride
and Luxury, are yet by custom become ne∣cessary
to our Commerce, by which means
the Luxury of the People is become a ver∣tue
in Trade.</P>
<P>If a due Calculation were made of all the
several Trades besides Labouring, Manufac∣turing
and Handicraft Business, which are
supported in this Nation merely by the
Sins of the People, <HI>as I may call them,</HI> I
mean the sumptuary Trades, the Ribbons,
the Perfumes, the Silks, the Cambricks, the
Muslins, and all the numberless Gayeties of
Dress; as also by the Gluttony, the Drunk∣enness,
and other exorbitances of Life, it
might remain a question, whether the ne∣cessary
or the unnecessary were the greatest
blessing to Trade; and whether reforming
our Vices wou'd not ruin the Nation.</P>
<P>'Tis very hard, and a melancholy reflec∣tion
to think, that Wickedness shou'd have
got such root in this Nation, and should be
so effectually fix'd, that it could not be re∣moved,
but at the expence of our Trade,
and the ruin of an infinite number of Peo∣ple;
that it is so incorporated with our
<PB N="102" REF="416"/>
felicity, that like a Limb of the Body an
amputation wou'd endanger the Life.</P>
<P>It is next to Incredible, what a share the
Luxury of the Age has, in the Employment
of Families, and in the multiplying of Trades∣men
in this Nation, among whom no one
article they deal in, may be call'd a neces∣sary
to Life, or even to the real comforts
of Life.</P>
<P>The exorbitances of Dress I have named,
at least some of them; the excesses of Eat∣ing
and Drinking I have but just named;
but I may be allowed to add, that those ex∣cesses,
as they are more Criminal than those
of Dress and Attire, so they are even in that
excess become more interwoven with our
publick advantages; and to our great Mis∣fortune
be it spoken, are so necessary to the
support of the very Government, as well as of
Commerce, that without the Revenue now
raised by them, we can hardly see how
the publick Affairs could be supported. For
example:
<Q><P>The Wine-trade, as calculated above, pays
the Government in the ordinary cus∣toms,
besides the advantages flowing
from it to the Shipping, the Naviga∣tion,
and the employ of Seamen, above
580000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> If it should be something over
or under, that is not material in so
general a calculation.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="417"/>
The Malt tax as mention'd above 600000,
some rate it now, including <HI>Scotland,</HI>
at 700000, but I think it too much.</P>
<P>The Excise, take it in all its Branches up∣on
Liquors, and now including Coffee
and Tea, which may well be call'd
part of our Luxury, I suppose to be,
1.000000 more or less,</P>
<P>Together 2.180000 <HI>l. per Annum.</HI></P></Q></P>
<P>Observe that this is supposed to be the
nett duties clear of the vast expences of
the Collection, which it is not my business
to examine here; because I am now giv∣ing
only the gross sums of things where∣in
there is no necessity of a strict examina∣tion
into smaller Circumstances.</P>
<P>But the great enquiry upon the Suppo∣sition
of these Calculations being really true,
or near the truth, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>How many Wines and Brandy wou'd be
imported? how much Malt made, and Beer
brew'd, and Spirits distill'd, and Coffee and
Tea drank; if all Luxury and Intemperance
were laid aside, if no more of all these was to
be made use of, than a due moderation in the
use of them all required? I do not mean
that the People shou'd be supposed to drink
no more Strong-beer or Ale than necessi∣ty
required, that they shou'd take Wine
only as Physick, and that Canary shou'd be
<PB N="104" REF="418"/>
sold only in the Apothecaries Shops, as was
the case in <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. time, and in Queen
<HI>Elizabeth</HI> also; and that all of them were
to be used no more than was needful
for Health, which by the way wou'd go but
a very little way.</P>
<P>But I wou'd suggest a moderate temperate
way of drinking only; suppose it to be such
as the <HI>Spaniards, Italians</HI> and such Nations
use it, that no Drunkenness, no Extrava∣gancies,
no Excesses were practis'd among
us, either among the Poor or the Rich; and
let any one that understands the general
Consumption of these Liquors tell me, what
defalcation he thinks wou'd be made in the
revenue from what it is, as things now stand
among us; and whether at least a million
and half of that vast Revenue wou'd not
be taken off from the account.</P>
<P>But then, let them tell us also, what a
dreadful Blow wou'd this Reformation be
to Trade? however necessary, however call'd
for by Heaven and Earth, however requir'd
for the health both of Soul and Body, that's
not the question: But it wou'd be a clap
of Thunder to the Nation: As it wou'd im∣mediately
save above a million of Money,
so it wou'd immediately starve above a mil∣lion
of People.</P>
<P>How many Ale-houses must shut up, how
many Bushes be taken down, what an ar∣my
of Drawers and Tapsters, that scum of
<PB N="105" REF="419"/>
the Rabble, wou'd immediately go a beg∣ging?
what regiments of Gaugers and Ex∣cise-men,
Tide-waiters and Searchers, and
all the Mob of Custom-house and Excise
Officers wou'd be disbanded, and left to the
Grave and the Gallows? and what an in∣numerable
throng of Women and Children,
the wretched dependants of those misera∣bles,
wou'd come to the Parish for Bread?</P>
<P>And what must be done in this case? 'tis
a dreadful story; that's the truth of it; the
Nation's Prosperity is built on the ruin of
the Nation's Morals; their Excesses are the
Excess of their welfare, and in a Word,
we must Preach no more to them Sobriety,
Temperance, and Abatement either of Pride
or Drunkenness, for if they shou'd reform
they are undone; upon the giving up their
Souls depends the keeping up their Bodies;
and if you put a stop to the Excesses of the
Age, as you lessen the Revenue, so you ruin
the People; in short, Virtue would be really,
in the very Letter of it, a SINKING FUND,
for it wou'd in a Word sink the value of ma∣ny
of our most important Funds; and to
add to it all, it wou'd sink the value of
Lands too: The Consumption of a pro∣digious
quantity of the Barley, which is now
used, would be lessen'd in proportion, and
the Lands which are yearly employ'd to
produce it be uncultivated.</P>
<P>But what a blow wou'd it be to Trade?
<PB N="106" REF="420"/>
it wou'd take up all the remaining part of this
Work, to give a particular account of the
many Trades and Families of Tradesmen,
and the poor People depending upon them,
who must sink, be without business, and seek
their Bread at other Employments, which
they were not bred to.</P>
<P>What a poor Nation must we have been
if we had been a sober, religious, temperate
Nation? How had preserving our Morals
made us Beggars? unless the Rich had run
into Excesses and Crimes innumerable,
How must innumerable poor have starv'd?
in a Word, it looks as if we were bound to
be wicked or Poor, and go a sotting, or go
a begging; the wealth of the Country is
rais'd by its Wickedness, and if it shou'd be
reform'd it wou'd be undone.</P>
<P>Nor is this our case in our Liquors only,
and in our gaieties of Dress, but in almost
every thing else; particularly in our table
Excesses; the wast and wantonness in Eating
is come to such a height, that it is the sup∣port
of innumerable People: what a swarm
of Gardiners, Poulterers, Pastry-Cooks, Eat∣ing-houses,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> are supported by the mere
Extraordinaries of Eating; raising Plants by
mere Violence, and as it were a rape upon the
Earth; forcing her to produce things before
her time, and as it were in spite of seasons,
climates, forward or backward Springs, and
the most obstinate opposition of natural
Causes?</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="421"/>
What Rapes are committed upon nature
in the production of Animals as well as
Plants? making the Ewes bring Lambs all
the Winter, fatting Calves to a monstrous
size, using cruelties and contrary diets to
the poor Brute, to whiten its Flesh for the
Palates of the Ladies, and to gorge the dain∣ty
Stomachs of those that lay up their feli∣city
in Eating fine, as they call it?</P>
<P>It is not my business here to write a Satyr
upon Luxury, and therefore I go no farther
in my Exclamations against these horrible
Excesses: But as my Observations lye an∣other
way, I return to the Text. How many
Trades are depending upon these unhappy
Articles? how many People, Cattle, Acres
of Land, nay whole Countries (almost) are
employ'd, in furnishing Rarities for the
nice Palates of these Friends to Luxury?
Should we be reduc'd to moderation in our
diet, and to feed sparingly, though whole∣some
too, but not dainty, so as Heaven could
with but one dry or wet Summer bring us
to the necessity of doing; how many Trades∣men
wou'd it be the ruin of? how many
Maid-servants wou'd it dismiss from their
Places? how many Shops wou'd it shut up?
how many Kitchens wou'd it make half use∣less?
in a Word, was Eating and Drinking
reduced to things needful only, and to need∣ful
quantities too, we shou'd be a most mi∣serable
Nation as to Trade, I won't say but
<PB N="108" REF="422"/>
more of our People wou'd dye good Chris∣tians,
and many of them live longer too,
as well as better than they do. But we
shou'd have no more Trade than they have
in <HI>Swedeland</HI> and <HI>Norway,</HI> comparatively
speaking; and our moderation and temper∣ance,
practis'd first to reform our manners,
wou'd be soon necessary to us, for want of
Money to live better.</P>
<P>It must be confess'd, Trade is almost uni∣versally
founded upon Crime; the few Ar∣ticles
which mere necessity obliges one Na∣tion
to purchase from another, are very
few; they would employ but few Ships,
call for small Stocks, and but few Mer∣chants:
I do not doubt but necessity was
the first foundation of Trade: People tra∣vel'd
or sail'd from one Nation to another
to buy and exchange such Goods only as
they wanted for their needful supply: But
yet finding in remote Countries rarities to
invite the curious, gaieties to tempt the fine,
rich Furrs to clothe the tender and delicate,
and fine Silks to please the wanton and
gay world; these being carried away and
brought to Countries where they receiv'd
Goods equally rare, but perhaps as super∣fluous,
they carried Specimens at first to shew
in the Countries they came from, and there
receiv'd orders to fetch over quantities, and
thus we came to have the Silks of <HI>Persia,</HI>
the Sables and Ermins of <HI>Russia</HI> and <HI>Mus∣covy,</HI>
<PB N="109" REF="423"/>
the Callicoes of <HI>India;</HI> thus the <HI>Per∣sians</HI>
and <HI>Armenians</HI> fetch our Woollens,
tho' they have their own Silks: Thus the
toys and trifles, the essences and perfumes of
the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Italians,</HI> the Wine and
Oil of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and all the superfluities
of the Nations are carried from Place to
Place at a vast Expence, and become the
subject of Trade, both of Labour and Mo∣ney,
and find Employment for millions of
People in all parts almost of the World.</P>
<P>On this very account, two thirds of the
Navigation of the World is employ'd, to
speak nothing of Land-carriage; let a short
reflection explain it to your understanding,
we have in <HI>England</HI> ten thousand sail of
Ships, some say twenty thousand, and I
believe they that say twenty speak nearest
the truth.</P>
<P>Now take out of those all the Coal-ships,
Salt-ships, Corn-ships, and such like coast∣ing
Vessels, which carry necessaries from
one place to another, and for the supply of
this great City in particular, and others in
proportion: Take away the Fishing Ves∣sels
also for the same Places, and what are
all the rest employ'd in? How at least does
the unnecessary mingle with the needful,
and what few absolutely necessary things
do we find among the rest?</P>
<P>What necessity have we of all our <HI>East-India</HI>
Trade? of the Callicoes, wrought Silks,
<PB N="110" REF="424"/>
raw-Silk; the Tea of <HI>China,</HI> the Coffee of
<HI>Arabia,</HI> the Diamonds of <HI>Golconda</HI> and of
<HI>Borneo,</HI> the Oriental Pearl of <HI>Ormus</HI> and
<HI>Gamberoon,</HI> the Emeralds of the Great <HI>Mo∣gul</HI>'s
Country, the Indigo of <HI>Lahore,</HI> the
Salt-peter and the Dye-stuffs of the rest, and
the Pepper likewise of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and other
trifles of all that Country, nay, even the
Spices themselves, <HI>I say</HI> what is our neces∣sity
of them all?</P>
<P>Even the Tobacco of <HI>Virginia,</HI> the Sugars
and Melasses of <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> the Cocoa and
the Rum of <HI>Jamacia,</HI> and the Furs and Bea∣ver
of all the other Countries of <HI>America,</HI>
what necessity are they of?</P>
<P>The Wines, the Fruit, the Brandy, the
Lace, the Calicoes, Cambricks and other
fine Linens, from <HI>France, Spain, Portugal,
Italy</HI> and <HI>Flanders?</HI></P>
<P>The fine Oil from <HI>Lucca,</HI> the Capers and
Anchovies from <HI>Leghorn,</HI> the Oranges from
<HI>Seville,</HI> and the Limons from <HI>Malaga,</HI> what
are they but Sauces to whet our gorg'd
Appetites, and to assist our surfeited Sto∣machs,
over-charg'd with quantities of Food,
help our Gluttony and prompt us to repeat
our Cravings, and call for more?</P>
<P>In a Word, our Navigation is chiefly em∣ploy'd
upon the exorbitances of Life; such
as we call needful for Trade, but in the
main are not necessary to the being of Man∣kind,
no, nor for their <HI>well being</HI> neither;
<PB N="111" REF="425"/>
but are employ'd in promoting the Luxury
of the World, and are all now thought
extraordinary advantages to the publick, as
they encrease Trade; so that to promote
Trade is a sufficient defence now, of any
branch of Commerce, however tending di∣rectly
to the propagating Vice; like laying
a Tax upon Cards and Dice, which seems
to be a Tacit Liberty to the use of them,
whether otherwise lawful or no.</P>
<P>But not to make this Work a continued
Satyr, let any Man who thinks these things
worth considering, reflect upon the Com∣merce
of other Countries, and only make the
comparison; he will soon see what are the
specific reasons why we have so much Trade
and those other Countries so little; why
our People are employ'd and theirs starve;
why our Poor live well and theirs to the
last degree miserable.</P>
<P>Take the comparison between the Do∣minions
of the <HI>Turks</HI> and those of <HI>England,</HI>
and between the great City of <HI>Constanti∣nople</HI>
and the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Turks,</HI> whatever else they are, and
however wicked, blasphemous, cruel, that's
nothing to us; but certainly, did all the rest
of the World live like them, the thing call∣ed
Trade would hardly deserve a name in
the World, I mean-comparatively to the pro∣digious
hurry the Christian part of <HI>Europe</HI>
appears to be in.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="426"/>
Their Trade is only an exchange of the
more necessary things of Life, such as we
say are required for Food and Raiment;
this Food is far from luxurious feasting, or
faring diliciously, such as we call fine Eating
and nice Feeding; their treats are Coffee,
Sherbet, and messes of Rice, dress'd their own
way, a little Flesh and but very little.</P>
<P>Their Clothes know no gaiety, very little or∣nament,
except among the <HI>Bassas,</HI> the <HI>Sultans</HI>
and the Persons of Rank; nor do they of∣ten
change their Fashions, so that the ex∣pensive
part of their Clothing, which gives
a mass of Employment in such a City as
this, is not known.</P>
<P>As is their Habit, the like are their Build∣ings
and Furniture, Gardens, Equipages,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> nothing of Ostentation appears, nothing
Chargable; how then should there be any
business, for such throngs of Artificers of
several sorts, as are to be found in this part
of the World?</P>
<P>Let us consider <HI>London</HI> as containing a
million 500000 People, as I believe to be of
the least, taking <HI>London</HI> with its dependencies,
that is to say, for five Miles round it: I ven∣ture
to affirm, that if all the Trades of which
there are none to be found in <HI>Constantino∣ple,</HI>
were to be taken civilly and quietly out
of the City of <HI>London,</HI> there wou'd be much
fewer People in <HI>London</HI> than there are now
in <HI>Constantinople:</HI> For Example:</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="427"/>
The <HI>Turks</HI> have neither Malt or Malt<SEG REND="decorInit">L</SEG>iquor:
There at once they abate you all
the Inns, Ale-houses and Publick Drinking
or Eating-houses, which are to be seen in
<HI>London,</HI> and the parts adjacent; and whose
number is so scandalously great, that should
it be made publick, Strangers would hardly
think it credible: But if you were to see
the number that depend upon them too,
such as Maltsters, Malt-makers, Brewers
and their Servants, Taps, ters and all the
nameless crew of Masters and Servants,
Horses, Carriages, Farmers, Ploughmen,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> who all get their Bread by the Drink∣ing-trade;
reckoning from the sowing the
Barley to the drunken consumer of the Li∣quor:
How many thousands more would
there still be that would have their Bread to
seek, and new Employments to look out for,
if the Drinking of Malt Liquor was to
be taken wholly out of Trade, and the
practice of it at once left off?</P>
<P>From the Beer and Ale, let us adjourn
to the Distillers of Malt-spirits; I have ob∣served
in its place, that the Distillers in this
City only, consume two hundred thousand
quarts of Malt every Year, besides 15000
hogsheads of Cyder in the distilling or draw∣ing
Spirits: to reduce this to the vulgar Mea∣sure
known abroad, it is sixteen hundred
thousand Bushels of Malt, and 40000 Bari∣co's
<PB N="114" REF="428"/>
of Cyder, for those Measures they only
know it by at <HI>Constantinople.</HI></P>
<P>Add to this, all the several quantities of
Spirits extracted from Melasses, from
eager, and damag'd Wines, and Bottoms,
whose number we cannot easily guess at.</P>
<P>Go on then to the Wine, Brandy, Cy∣der
and other Liquors consum'd in this City,
which according to some is not less than
50000 ton of Wine, and 10000 ton of
Brandy, Cyder, and all other Liquors.</P>
<P>Bring this to a calculation with the City
of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> where, unless the <HI>Franks</HI>
and <HI>Jews,</HI> there is no such thing as Wine,
Brandy, or Spirits tasted, unless secretly and
by stealth, it being prohibited by their Law.</P>
<P>Take then our of our accounts of Trade
in <HI>London,</HI> all the Merchants, Importers of
Wine, all the Wine-Coopers, Porters, Car∣men,
and their Servants and Horses who
are concern'd in Landing, Housing, Carry∣ing
in, and Carrying out these Wines, be∣fore
they come to the Vintner, and the
Pint-pot.</P>
<P>Strike off next all the Vintners, Tavern-Keepers,
Inn-Keepers and Publick-houses,
who draw Wine; with their Drawers and
Servants; all the Strong-water-shops, Bran∣dy-shops,
Cyder-houses, Gin-shops, Punch-houses
and Retailers of Spirits, and all their
Servants and Dependencies.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="429"/>
Next take off all the Cooks, Eating-houses,
Spring-gardens, Bowling-greens, and
others, such as are call'd houses of Entertain∣ment
and their Dependencies; all the Hack∣ney-coachmen,
Chairmen and their Depen∣dants,
none of all which are known or
heard of in <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the place we
are now to measure with.</P>
<P>Then call over all your Hair-merchants,
Perriwig-makers and their Servants and De∣pendencies,
all the Coach-makers, Chair∣makers,
Harness-makers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Trades so pro∣digiously
multiply'd of late in this City,
with all the numberless Artificers depend∣ing
upon and employ'd by them, such as
Glass-makers, Founders, Workers in Lea∣ther,
in Iron and in Brass, Painting, Carv∣ing,
Gilding, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>All the several Trades employ'd in the
gay Equipages of our People, and particu∣larly
the Liveries for perhaps an hundred
thousand Coachmen, Footmen, Pages, Va∣lets,
and such Servants as wear Liveries.</P>
<P>It is well known, you see no Perriwigs
worn among the <HI>Turks,</HI> they have Slaves
indeed, but they are not so kind to give
them Liveries, lac'd Coats, edg'd Hats and
shoulder Knots; the <HI>Turks</HI> keep no Coach∣es
or Chairs, Chaises or Berlins; the Ladies
walk on Foot to Church; nor are their
Mosques parted off into Pews, and lin'd
with Green-cloth or Velvet to separate the
<PB N="116" REF="430"/>
high from the low, the <HI>Bassa</HI> kneels down
with the poor <HI>Janizary,</HI> the rich with the
poor, make their Prayers together.</P>
<P>I could make some just observations here
upon our ordinary behaviour in solemn
things, so scandalous to all the Nations of
the World, and 'tis hard to forbear; but it
is not my business here; I return to the
Trade.</P>
<P>Let those that consider <HI>Constantinople</HI>
to be a City containing a million of Peo∣ple,
and yet subsisting under all these nega∣tives
in Trade, calculate if they can how
many People wou'd be found in <HI>London,</HI> or
<HI>Paris,</HI> or <HI>Amsterdam,</HI> if all the ways of
living mentioned above were taken away,
and many more that I could name.</P>
<P>Not to say a word of all the Ships which
are employ'd in bringing these forbidden,
(out of fashion) Materials to them, and all
the Trades depending upon the building and
constant repair of those Ships: For Ex∣ample:</P>
<P>The
<HI>Turks</HI> have no Collonies in remote
Countries, to bring in vast Fleets yearly, the
Growth of <HI>Virginia, Barbadoes, Jamaica,
New-Spain</HI> and the <HI>Brasils;</HI> their Tobacco
Grows as it were every where at their own
Doors, they Drink their Coffee without Su∣gar,
nature's juices are sufficient to them
without sweetning; there at once a vast
throng of <HI>West-India</HI> Merchants with all
<PB N="117" REF="431"/>
their Ships, the Loading and the Sailors are
quite put out of Employment and voted
useless in Trade.</P>
<P>I might go on to discard out of Trade all
the mighty throng of those Trades who get
their living here by vanity and dress; I
mean by the variety and changes of fashion
in dress, whether of Men or Women, as
also for the rich furniture of Houses, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
what numbers of Taylors and Mantua-ma∣kers,
Hosiers, Milleners, Sempstresses, Up∣holsterers
and in particular Lace-shops and
Linen-drapers must we dismiss out of Trade
in this Case.</P>
<P>Particularly, and which indeed I should
have reckoned before, all the Haberdashers
of Hats, and Glovers, all the Hat-makers
and Glove-makers wou'd be dismiss'd at
once, and most of the Shoe-makers also; so
that the spoil wou'd fall among the Handi∣crafts
also, as well as among the Trades∣men.</P>
<P>But
to avoid dwelling upon things too
long, this great City, I believe, must be glad
to dismiss two thirds of its People, and send
them into the Country to 'Till the Land,
and get their Bread as <HI>Adam</HI> did, by the
Sweat of their Brows; where they must dis∣perse
too, and scatter up and down, for they
must live no more of them in a place, than
the Land could maintain, if they did they
must starve.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="432"/>
I bring all this home to my first argu∣ment
thus; <HI>viz.</HI> Trade is propagated by
our crimes, the people support one another
by their Extravagance and Luxury, their
Gaiety and Pride; Gluttony and Drunken∣ness
assist to maintain the Nation; the peo∣ple
grow rich by the people; they support
one another; the Taylor, the Draper, the
Mercer, the Coach-maker, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and their
Servants, all haunt the Publick-houses; the
Masters to the Taverns, the Servants to the
Ale-houses, and thus the Vintner and the
Victualler thrive and grow rich. Those a∣gain
getting before-hand in the World,
must have fine Clothes, fine Houses, and
fine Furniture; their Wives grow gay, as
the Husbands grow rich, and they go to the
Draper, the Mercer, the Taylor, the Up∣holsterer,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to buy fine Clothes and nice
Goods; Thus the Draper and Mercer and
Taylor grow rich too, Money begets Mo∣ney,
Trade circulates, and the tide of Mo∣ney
flows in with it, one hand washes the
other hand, and both hands wash the Face.</P>
<P>Hence we see the Tradesman depends
upon the poor as well as the rich, and all
together makes Trade; which observation
affords a good inference to keep a Trades∣man
humble; but of that by itself.</P>
<P>In the mean time, this however may be
said in the behalf or defence of our Com∣merce,
as well Foreign as Home Trade, <HI>viz.</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="433"/>
that the Trade does not make the Vice,
but the Vice makes the Trade; if the Trades∣men
propagate Crimes in the ordinary way
of their business, the fault is not in the Trade,
but in the Man; as in the care of Drunken∣ness,
the Grape and the Malt is not charg∣able,
they are an innocent product, no, nor
are the Wine, the Spirits, the Beer or A<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
guilty; 'tis the excess, 'tis drinking them
extravagantly, taking an unreasonable quan∣tity
loytering away an unreasonable deal of
time, spending their Money and starving
their Families; these are the Vices.</P>
<P>Again, Trade, take it in the first Person
of the Tradesman, does not introduce the
Luxury, and Extravagance of the people; or
their exorbitant expence in fine Clothes or
fine Equipages, their Pride and Ostentation
in either or any of these: But the Vice is
in the breast of the vicious; the Pride is in
the inside of the Beau, while his Embroide∣ries,
his Laces, his fine Clothes only flut∣ter
in the Wind from the outside of his
Carcass. Now the Tradesman indeed takes
the advantage of the Fop, and puts in to
furnish him with Gaieties, and fine Feathers:
But the Tradesman does not bid him turn
Peacock, and strut about to shew and spread
his Plumes.</P>
<P>The Man is a Fool, or Fop, or Beau, the
terms are synonymous, 'tis much the same
call him what you will, he comes to the
<PB N="120" REF="434"/>
Tradesman's shop, he buys one toy here, ano∣ther
trifle there; he calls for Silver-buttons
in one place, fine Brocade or Cloth of Gold
in another; here he sets an Embroiderer to
Work, there a Lace-maker; he directs
one to make this, another that; in a
word, he scatters his Money about as a Far∣mer
makes Hay, and when all these things
are brought together; as <HI>Aaron</HI> cast the
Earings into the Fire, and out came a Calf;
so the Taylor is sent for, and all the ap∣paratus
of his Pride being thrown into his
hands, out comes the Pye-ball'd party-co∣lour'd
Beau, compleatly cook'd up and dress'd
as gay as a Merry-andrew.</P>
<P>All this while 'tis not the Monkey that
plays the Man, but 'tis the Man that plays the
Monkey; 'tis not the Merry-andrew that
acts the Mountebank, 'tis the Mountebank
that acts the Merry-andrew: But still Trade
is in the right of it, to take their Money for
this is a vertue, as it employs a great num∣ber
of People; and thus it frequently appears,
that the extravagant pride of the age feeds
Trade, and consequently the Poor.</P>
<P>And what wou'd become of Trade if it
was not thus? The alternative is unhappily
come upon us; we must either sell them
fine Clothes, or they will buy abroad, which
is quite contrary to the reason of Trade:
If fine Silks, rich Brocades, Velvets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
are not to be had here, the Beau and the
<PB N="121" REF="435"/>
fine Lady will send to <HI>France</HI> for them, nay,
they will go to <HI>France</HI> to fetch them, rather
than want them.</P>
<P>The <HI>French</HI> do the like, they are forbid
importing our fine Woolen Cloths into
<HI>France;</HI> and their Manufacturers, whatever
they boast of, cannot make the like there:
And what follows? we see every Summer
the <HI>French</HI> Beaus make a trip over to <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
on purpose to make new Clothes
and go home again (for they may carry
them ready made.)</P>
<P>It may be answer'd, we might reduce
the national Pride by sumptuary Laws; re∣straining
the wearing of Embroidery, Silver
and Gold Trimmings, high priz'd Laces, and
the like. Hold there; you may restrain their
Extravagance, but you can't promise to re∣strain
their Pride; the gay Dress may be for∣bid,
yet the gay temper may remain; so you
ruin your Trade and keep your Vice.</P>
<P>A Man lighted off from his Horse, to
take a stone out of his Foot, and to ease
the poor Creature who halted sorely; The
ignorant Horse kick'd him, (perhaps sup∣posing
he was going to hurt him, his Foot
being tender) is it so! answers the Man (and
(lifting his own Foot up) gives the Horse a
kick, <HI>there's kick for kick,</HI> (says he) <HI>and
the stone in your Foot still.</HI></P>
<P>All your sumptuary Laws do nothing to re∣form
the Vice, and yet they injure the Trade
<PB N="122" REF="436"/>
so, that there's the Trade wounded, the
Tradesmen ruin'd, and the Crime's in the
Country still.</P>
<P>But to return to the case as it is; Trade
takes the benefit of all your Extravagancies,
Trade gains by the Vice, but Trade does
not make the Vice; that would be to make
Trade criminal in its own nature; and no
honest Man could then be a Tradesman, no
religious Man could be a Mercer, or a Lace∣man,
or a Taylor, and so of the rest; and
this way indeed it might be said, as I for∣merly
noted, that a Tradesman could not
be an honest Man.</P>
<P>It is most certain, that Trade is supported
and enlarg'd, especially in this Country, by
many Branches of our excesses and immo∣ralities;
and tho' I might set down some
Expedients here, which might contribute
something towards an abatement at least of
the evil, tho' not to an effectual cure, yet
as I am upon other things in this Work, it
is at present quite out of the way.</P>
<P>Collected bodies of People are also a par∣ticular
assistance to Trade; and therefore
to have one great and capital City in a
Kingdom, is a very great advantage to
Trade, and much more than if the same
numbers of People dwelt in several places.
For example:</P>
<P>Suppose the City of <HI>London</HI> to contain
fifteen hundred thousand People, as they
<PB N="123" REF="437"/>
tell us it does; I insist that it is much more
to the advantage of the whole Kingdom,
I mean as to Trade, that it shou'd be so,
than that the same number of People were
divided equally, and liv'd in fifteen seve∣ral
Cities remote from one another.</P>
<P>It is the same as to Navigation, it is much
better that they have here one command∣ing
Port, one noble navigable River, than
that they had in their divided and remote
situation, as above, fifteen navigable Rivers,
one to every City.</P>
<P><HI>Spain</HI> is a remarkable infstance of this,
there is there no capital City, the City or
rather Village of <HI>Madrid,</HI> where the Court
resides, is supposed to contain 300,000 Peo∣ple,
and this is call'd the capital; but it has
neither Sea-port or Inland Navigation, no
Navigable River being near it; the nearest is
the <HI>Tagus</HI> at <HI>Toledo,</HI> which is not only distant
12 Leagues at least, but does not open in∣to
the Sea in the same Dominion, but in
<HI>Portugal;</HI> so that it is no Navigation at all
as to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>Spain</HI> has abundance of other Popu∣lous
Cities and Sea-ports in it, disperst and
remote from one another, as <HI>Seville, Gra∣nada,
Cadiz, Barcelona, Saragossa, Malaga,
Granada, Valentia, Toledo, Cordoua,</HI> and
several others.</P>
<P>The first of those, <HI>Seville,</HI> has at least
300,000 People in it also, and several of the
<PB N="124" REF="438"/>
rest from 100,000 upwards to near 200,000,
at <HI>Cadiz, Barcelona, Malaga, Saragossa,
Valentia, Granada,</HI> which last City our
best Geographers reckon to be very near as
Populous as <HI>Seville</HI> or <HI>Madrid;</HI> to sum them
up from the the <HI>Spanish</HI> way of estimating
Cities, and by the best accounts, we can
meet with, take them thus.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Madrid</HI> 24000 Families, half of which
are of Nobility and Quality, having
from 20 to 30 and upwards in Family,
the rest being of the ordinary rate.</P>
<P>Besides estimating the King's Houshold at
the <HI>Pardo,</HI> which including the ordi∣nary
Guards is said to contain always
12000 Souls. 2. <HI>Seville,</HI> containing
60000 Families at six in a House 360000
Souls. 3. <HI>Granada,</HI> 50000 Families.
4. <HI>Malaga. 5. Cordoua. 6. Valentia.</HI>
7. <HI>Barcelona. 8. Saragossa. 9. Cadiz.</HI>
10. <HI>Majorca,</HI> each of these, 15000 Fa∣milies,
which with the Poor and the re∣ligious
Houses make far above 100000
in each City.</P></Q>
<P>The reason of naming these Cities will
appear presently: Put them all together, they
are not supposed to contain more People
than the City of <HI>London,</HI> and those adja∣cent
Towns to <HI>London,</HI> which depend up∣on
<PB N="125" REF="439"/>
their supply of Provisions from the Ci∣ty,
including also the Ships in the River.</P>
<P>Now as these Cities stand all remote
from one another, and most of them in the
most rich and fertil soil, on or near the Sea∣coasts,
or on the banks of navigable Rivers,
their supply of Provisions, Fewel, Clothing,
Equipage, Furniture, and take it of as ma∣ny
kinds as you please, does neither come
with difficulty, call for multitudes of hands
to be employ'd in raising, procuring, fetch∣ing
or carrying them, nor does it Influence
the Country to any perceptible degree,
except perhaps for twenty or thirty Miles
round them.</P>
<P>But were all these Cities, that is to say,
the number of the Inhabitants included in
them, all join'd in one capital, suppose <HI>Ma∣drid,</HI>
and tho' you were to suppose <HI>Ma∣drid</HI>
had a noble navigable River coming
up to it, such as the <HI>Tagus,</HI> or the <HI>Ebro,</HI> or
the <HI>Guadalquiver,</HI> 'tis evident, the whole
Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> large and spacious as it is,
for it may be reckon'd almost 500 Miles
Square, wou'd be engag'd and influenced,
more or less, in supplying that one City
with Provisions.</P>
<P>All the Sea-coasts, and all the Cities and
Ports upon those Coasts wou'd be busied, and
Fleets of Ships employ'd to furnish Wine,
Corn, Oil, Fruits, and Foreign Importations of
every kind, all to the capital port of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="440"/>
All the Inland Provinces wou'd be en∣gag'd
and employ'd in Ploughing and Sow∣ing
the Lands, to raise Corn, planting Vines
and groves of Olives, to make Wine and
Oil for this great Metropolis.</P>
<P>All the rich Meadows and Pastures wou'd
be improv'd to feed and fatten the black
Cattle, to nourish the Cows, suckle the
Calves, and furnish Beef, Veal and Milk,
Butter, Cheese, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all the Mountains,
the Forrests, and Plains for breeding the black
Cattle and Horses before they came to those
rich Pastures; also the Plains must be co∣ver'd
with flocks of Sheep, which are now
disperst and scatter'd a few and few together;
and thus as it is in <HI>England,</HI> every Pro∣vince
wou'd be providing something for the
Capital.</P>
<P>Nor is it a just objection to say, the same
number of People will consume the same
quantity of Provisions in whatever situation
they may be plac'd; for tho' the quantity
should be the same, yet the Influences up∣on
Trade occasion'd by it being all pointed
to one Center, is such as quite alters the
case, and wou'd put the whole Body of the
People into motion as it is in <HI>England.</HI>
What Fleets would there be employ'd to
bring Oil from <HI>Seville</HI> and <HI>Majorca,</HI> Wine
from <HI>Cadiz, Malaga, Alicant, Barcelona,</HI>
and <HI>Galicia, &amp;c.</HI> Fish, Wrought Iron and
Steel, all sorts of Weapons, fire Arms and
<PB N="127" REF="441"/>
Artillery from <HI>Bilboa</HI> and st. <HI>Antonio,</HI> and
Silk and Wool from <HI>Segovia</HI> and <HI>Valentia,</HI>
and the like from other parts?</P>
<P>What an infinite number of Horses, Mules
and Carriages, and Carriers must be em∣ploy'd
by Land from all the inland Provinces
to carry the Product of the Earth directly
to <HI>Madrid,</HI> or if too remote for that, to
carry them to the several Sea-ports, where
those Ships and Fleets were to take them
on board?</P>
<P>How is this the cause of employing a
thousand sail of Ships, and perhaps three
times as many in <HI>England?</HI> to bring the
Coals from one place, Salt from another,
Cheese from another, Lead from the North,
Block-Tin from the West, Corn from <HI>Hull,</HI>
from <HI>Lynn,</HI> and from all the Coasts of <HI>Nor∣folk,
Suffolk, Essex, Kent, Sussex,</HI> and <HI>South∣ampton,</HI>
Fish from all the Seas on the East
and South side of the Island, and so of the
rest.</P>
<P>How many thousands, I might say hun∣dreds
of thousands, of Men and Horses are
employ'd in the carrying and re-carrying to
and from <HI>London</HI> the Growth of <HI>England,</HI>
and the Importations of foreign Countries;
and how many of these wou'd stand still
and want Business, (nay want Bread, per∣haps,)
if this great City was divided into fif∣teen
Cities, as above; and they were situated
in so many different Places, remote from
<PB N="128" REF="442"/>
one another, where the Country within
twenty or thirty Miles round them wou'd be
sufficient for them, and able to supply them,
and where every Port would Import their
own Goods from Abroad.</P>
<P>In a Word, we should have a general
want of Business, whereas now all the
World (here among us) are in a hurry and
fully employ'd, in carrying out and carry∣ing
in.</P>
<P>Particularly observe another Article, the
number of People at <HI>London</HI> makes this
City the Center of foreign Commerce; here
a great quantity of Goods from all foreign
Countries, are brought in, because here is al∣ways
a Market, and here they can be con∣sum'd;
whereas take all the other Ports of
<HI>England,</HI> many of them can send Ships
Loaden out, but few can bring them Load∣en
home; for example:</P>
<P><HI>Bristol</HI> is the most capable of this, next
to <HI>London,</HI> and even <HI>Bristol</HI> cannot always
dispose of the Loading of Ships home;
again <HI>Yarmouth</HI> can send perhaps eight
or ten large Ships out to the <HI>Streights, viz.</HI>
to <HI>Cadiz,</HI> to <HI>Malaga,</HI> to <HI>Leghorn,</HI> to <HI>Ve∣nice,</HI>
every Year, laden with <HI>Red-herrings.</HI>
But if those Ships load back with Currants
from <HI>Zant,</HI> Oil from <HI>Gallipoli,</HI> Silk and <HI>Li∣pari,</HI>
Raisins and Oil from <HI>Messina,</HI> Silk
and Wine, fine Oils, Anchovies, Capers,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> from <HI>Leghorn;</HI> Silks, and Paper, and
<PB N="129" REF="443"/>
Sulphur, and blocks of Marble from <HI>Genoa,</HI>
what shall they do with those at <HI>Yarmouth?</HI>
they must all unlade and deliver their Car∣goes
at <HI>London,</HI> and so of the rest; so that
the bulk of <HI>London</HI> makes the Trade of
<HI>England;</HI> and those People thro' their abun∣dant
ignorance, especially in Trade, are great∣ly
mistaken, who pretend the bulk and
growing greatness of the City is, too much
for the whole Country; alledging that the
Nation is Liver-grown, and must dye of a
<HI>Pleura.</HI> The City drawing away the nourish∣ment
from the Country as a dropsie swells
the Body, but draws the nourishment away
from the extreme parts.</P>
<P>But I say, this is a mistake; even the simi∣le
itself will not hold; for this swelling the
Body of the City makes it the Center of
Nourishment to the whole Nation; and as
every part of the Kingdom sends up hither
the best of their Produce, so they carry back
a return of wealth: The Money flows from
the City into the remotest parts, and fur∣nishes
them again to encrease that Produce,
to improve the Lands, pay Rent to their
Landlords, Taxes to their Governors, and
supply their Families with necessaries; and
this is Trade.</P>
<P>Nor should we know any thing consider∣able
of this Trade if the greatness of the
City did not cause it; here the Manufactures
as well as Produce of the several Countries
<PB N="130" REF="444"/>
are amass'd for sale, as well for the circu∣lation
of Commerce at home, as the Ex∣portation
to Countries abroad.</P>
<P>Here Ships from all parts arrive, and se∣veral
of the most considerable Branches of
Trade are confin'd to this place by Law:
The <HI>East-India</HI> Trade is all settled here;
the <HI>Greenland</HI> Trade deliver all here; the
<HI>Italian</HI> Thrown Silk is confin'd to be im∣ported
here, and here only, and at no other
Port in <HI>England:</HI> Here the <HI>African</HI> Com∣pany
import all their Gold, and the <HI>South-Sea</HI>
Company all their Silver; in a Word, 'tis
the great gulph of the <HI>British</HI> Trade, and as
it comes in here, so it goes out again from
hence to all parts of the Nation, circulating
in <HI>Home-Trade</HI> from the Merchant to the
Consumer.</P>
<P>Let us observe how this wou'd be in
<HI>Spain,</HI> to go back to the same reflections as
before; there is lately published, by an Au∣thority
that may be depended upon, an ac∣count
of the Consumption of Provisions at
<HI>Madrid;</HI> it is done by way of Ostenta∣tion,
to shew the greatness of the place,
and the number of its inhabitants, and a
little to take notice of the plenty of Flesh
eaten in <HI>Spain,</HI> in contradiction to the no∣tion
which some have in this Country, that
they eat more Flesh in <HI>London</HI> in a Month
than they do in all <HI>Spain</HI> in a Year; the
Account is thus.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="445"/>
Provisions consum'd for one Year, in the
capital Town of <HI>Madrid.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>500000 Sheep and Goats.</ITEM>
<ITEM>12000 Black Cattle or Beeves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6000 Lambs and Kids.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9000 Calves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>13000 Swine.</ITEM>
<ITEM>90000 Arobas of Oil.</ITEM>
<ITEM>960000 Arobas of Wine, each Aroba
is 25 pound weight, that is about three
Gallons and a half.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>56000 Quintals of Bacalco that is Salt
Fish, each Quintal 113 pound weight.</P>
<P>It must be acknowleg'd this is a very
considerable quantity of Provisions; but I
must add, that it is not possible to guess at
the numbers of People in <HI>Madrid,</HI> by this
account. On the other hand, take the Com∣putation
and compare it with <HI>England,</HI> I
make no doubt, but the City of <HI>Bristol</HI> con∣sumes
much more, tho' we do not reckon
one third of the People to be in it.</P>
<P>It is true, the Wine and the Oil exceeds
the expence of Wine and Oil in <HI>Bristol;</HI>
but if it be considered that their Oil is used
as we use Butter, and that Wine or Wa∣ter
is the only Liquor they Drink, and that
they have neither Malt-liquor or Cyder; the
Provisions consum'd at <HI>Bristol</HI> will far exceed
<PB N="132" REF="446"/>
those of <HI>Madrid,</HI> tho' <HI>Madrid</HI> is said to have
near 300000 People, and <HI>Bristol</HI> not quite
one.</P>
<P>For set the quantity of Butter, Cheese
and Milk against their Oil, and the quanti∣ty
will be infinitely out-done; and set the
Malt-liquor and Cyder and Wine against
their Wine alone, the quantity will exceed
in <HI>Bristol</HI> and the value much more.</P>
<P>As to the number of Sheep and Lambs,
I suppose there will be no great difference;
but for the Hogs, Lambs, Calves and black
Cattle, I doubt not but <HI>Bristol</HI> goes greatly
beyond <HI>Madrid,</HI> especially the Victualling
their Ships at <HI>Bristol</HI> included.</P>
<P>But to bring this back to my Subject;
all these Provisions expended at <HI>Madrid,</HI>
what do they do for the Country as to Trade?
Truly they employ the Country very
much, that's certain, and we must do justice;
and our City of <HI>Bristol</HI> does the like: But
how far in the Country does that Employ∣ment
extend? How far do they feel the
Influence? perhaps in <HI>Spain</HI> it may go far∣ther,
and the Country may be concern'd in
furnishing Corn twenty or thirty Mile, and
Cattle farther, forty or fifty Mile, but after
that you find little or nothing of it.</P>
<P>Thus at <HI>Bristol</HI> they carry Corn a great
way indeed, by Water down the Rivers <HI>Se∣vern</HI>
and <HI>Avon,</HI> out of <HI>Gloucestershire</HI> and
<HI>Worcestershire,</HI> and from the Vale of <HI>Eve∣sham;</HI>
<PB N="133" REF="447"/>
likewise they bring Cyder from <HI>He∣refordshire</HI>
down the <HI>Wye, Cheshire</HI> Cheese
by the <HI>Severn</HI> out of <HI>Shropshire,</HI> and But∣ter
from <HI>South-Wales</HI> by Sea, and so <HI>Bris∣tol</HI>
may affect all those Countries.</P>
<P>But their Black Cattle are supplied from
<HI>Somersetshire</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> and their Mutton
and Corn, Cheese and Bacon from <HI>Wilts</HI> and
<HI>Gloucestershires,</HI> all Counties just adjoining;
and after you are gone twenty Miles from
them, even in those Counties, you scarce find
any mention of the place; I mean of <HI>Bris∣tol;</HI>
nay one way there are other Cities and
great Towns that Intercept the Provisions,
so that very little comes that way, except
Beef; I mean <HI>Somersetshire,</HI> where there is
the City of <HI>Wells,</HI> the City of <HI>Bath,</HI> and the
Towns of <HI>Bridgwater</HI> and <HI>Froom;</HI> the latter
more Populous than both the two former
put together (tho' Cities) if we may believe
Fame and Travellers.</P>
<P>Thus Trade receives but little influence
from such places as <HI>Madrid</HI> in <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>Bri∣stol</HI>
in <HI>England,</HI> except it be just in the ad∣jacent
Counties, and within twenty or
thirty Mile of the place.</P>
<P>But bring this back to <HI>London,</HI> and con∣sider
the multitudes of People there, and the
exceeding numbers which are gather'd South∣ward
into the Counties and Towns for
thirty to forty Miles round <HI>London,</HI> almost
every way, how all the Country round is
<PB N="134" REF="448"/>
made populous by the vast run of Business oc∣casion'd
by the neighbourhood of the City;
insomuch that 'tis supposed if there is a
Million and half of People in <HI>London,</HI> there
is at least half a Million more in <HI>Middlesex,</HI>
and in those parts of <HI>Essex, Surrey</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI>
which lye so adjacent to <HI>London,</HI> as to be
within about ten Miles of it; now for the
supply of these two Millions of People, we
find the whole Kingdom more or less en∣gaged,
and the wheels of Trade are set a
going by it almost all over the Island.</P>
<P>Nor let us suppose that the Influence is small
at the remoter distances of the Country; but
just the contrary, for Multitudes of People
are employ'd in the extremest parts of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
for the supply of <HI>London,</HI> either with
Food or Fuel, or Manufactures, and that
to a surprizing degree; <HI>for Example:</HI></P>
<P>What a prodigy of Trade does the bare
bringing Coals from the North to <HI>London</HI>
keep up in the Nation? They tell us 30000
People are always employ'd under Ground,
in digging them at <HI>New-Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne;</HI>
a thousand sail of Ships, or not many fewer,
are employ'd in carrying them, and ten
thousand Seamen, Lightermen, Keelmen
and Boatmen, in the Loading, Carrying
and Unloading the Coals.</P>
<P>Of the Corn Trade I have spoken at large,
I refer to it for this part. Take then the But∣ter
Trade in <HI>Yorkshire</HI> and <HI>Suffolk;</HI> the
<PB N="135" REF="449"/>
Cheese Trade in <HI>Wilts, Gloucester</HI> and <HI>War∣wickshire,</HI>
all remote from <HI>London,</HI> and all
employ'd for the supply of <HI>London,</HI> where
(according to the most moderate accounts
I have met with) above fifty thousand ton
of Cheese is consum'd in a Year, and as
much Butter; with this difference only, that
the Butter is most of it made near <HI>London,</HI>
that is to say, within 40 to 50 Miles, the
Cheese generally from 70 to 150 Miles.</P>
<P>The multitudes of People concern'd in,
and employ'd by these things in the most
remote parts of the Kingdom, are not to
be conceiv'd, much less calculated, but by
those who understand the particular Funds
of Provisions, and the places where they are
made: How many Lands do they cause to be
cultivated and improv'd, by the vast stocks of
Cows fed on them? How many by the num∣bers
of Black Cattle fed in the farthest parts
of <HI>England,</HI> every way; as in <HI>Lancashire</HI> and
<HI>Westmoreland,</HI> the North-riding of <HI>Yorkshire,</HI>
the Counties of <HI>Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Kent</HI> and <HI>Sussex?</HI> such Bullocks as (by the
way) <HI>Spain</HI> never saw: Again the prodigi∣ous
extent of Grounds in the wilder and
remoter Parts of <HI>Scotland</HI> one way, and
<HI>Wales</HI> another, and the Mountains of <HI>York∣shire</HI>
and <HI>Durham</HI> another; all employ'd
in Breeding, as the other are in Feeding
the stores of Black-Cattle for the Market
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="450"/>
The like to be said of the Sheep, which
take up whole Counties and Tracts of Lands
in several Parts of the Country; as in <HI>Lei∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ester</HI>
and <HI>Lincolnshire, Northampton</HI> and
<HI>Bucks,</HI> the Bank of <HI>Tees,</HI> and <HI>Rumney-Marshes</HI>
in <HI>Kent,</HI> all these for large Sheep:
<HI>Salisbury-plain, Dorchester</HI> and <HI>Winchester,</HI>
and <HI>Marlbro'-downs,</HI> and all the open Coun∣try
between, for near 50 Miles square, <HI>for
midling siz'd Sheep;</HI> as likewise the <HI>Cats∣would-Hills,
Lemster-fields,</HI> the <HI>South-downs</HI>
in <HI>Sussex, Bansted-downs, New-market,</HI>
and <HI>Lincoln Heaths,</HI> whose Numbers are
Numberless, and all for the supply of <HI>Lon∣don.</HI></P>
<P>What an Infinite number of People do
these employ? What millions of Acres of
Land do they improve? And how do they
create and propagate Trade, even in the re∣motest
Corners of the Island, all mov'd,
supplied, and the Trade supported by the
prodigious Demand of all these things at the
capital City? Not half of which would be
felt, if the capital City and its adjacent
Multitudes were as I said above, separated,
and dwelt in ten or fifteen several Cities,
remote from one another, and every one
subsisting as it were by itself; I say, though
there wou'd be the same number of People
to feed, there wou'd not be half the Trade
or Business occasion'd to Feed them by.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="451"/>
The Hurry, the Bustle, the Throng, that
is to be seen here, evidently add to the
Trade; People beget a throng of Business,
how many Trades does it employ? what
crowds do they call for upon that very oc∣casion,
which in the divided Circumstances
of things wou'd not be thought of? <HI>For
Example,</HI></P>
<P>What need of Hackney Coaches in smal∣ler
Cities, either for the hurry and dispatch
of Business, or for Pleasure; where the num∣bers
abate the variety of both. How many
are there at <HI>Bristol,</HI> at <HI>Excester,</HI> at <HI>Norwich,</HI>
or at <HI>New-Castle</HI> upon <HI>Tyne? Edinburgh,</HI>
tho' a capital of a Kingdom separate, and
once bless'd with a Court, a Parliament, a
Term Court of Justice, and all the Cere∣mony
and necessary pomp of a Royal City,
had not above ten or twelve Hackney Coach∣es,
and no City or other Town in <HI>Bri∣tain</HI>
has any at all except <HI>London:</HI> This
therefore wou'd be all laid aside; so there
would be eight hundred Hackney Coach∣men,
and above two thousand Horses, besides
other depending People and their Families,
and all the Farmers and Carriages employ'd
to Furnish them with Forage, dismiss'd at
once out of Business, and made perfectly
useless in the World.</P>
<P>None of the Rivers in <HI>Britain,</HI> except
the <HI>Thames,</HI> have Wherries and Watermen
to Row on them, always plying at the
<PB N="138" REF="452"/>
Stairs, and wholly depending upon the car∣rying
Persons about their Business or Plea∣sure
as Passengers only; nor if the Cities
of <HI>England</HI> were dispers'd as above, would
any of them have occasion for such; neither
is it seen in the World where Boats ply in
that manner, except the Wherries at <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and the Gondolo's at <HI>Venice;</HI> and what
number of those wou'd be wanting, if the
City of <HI>London</HI> was reduc'd to about the
size of <HI>Bristol?</HI></P>
<P>There then wou'd be four or five thousand
Watermen, some say twice the number, dis∣miss'd
out of Business at once; and if you
include the Lightermen, Bargemen and Sail∣ors,
and other People employ'd upon the
River by the Coal and the Corn Trade, and
such like Business, more than are in pro∣portion
employ'd at <HI>Bristol,</HI> or wou'd be here
if this City were reduc'd to the size of the
City of <HI>Bristol;</HI> I say, if those were to be
included, you might without any Challenge
upon me for making an immoderate Com∣putation,
conclude thirty thousand People
immediately dropt out of Business, and all
their Families reduc'd to the utmost distress.</P>
<P>I take this Proposition about great Cities,
and the number of People collected toge∣ther
making Trade, to agree in some mea∣sure
with what you may observe in the
Spring of the Year, from the variety of the
Seasons; take a time of drought, and when
<PB N="139" REF="453"/>
the Earth for want of Rain is dry'd, hard
and parch'd up; comes a light flying Shower
and wets the Surface a little, and goes off;
then comes a hot gleam from the Sun, and
licks it up, and by and by comes another
dash of wet, and then more Sun shine, and so
on successively, and alternately, several times
a day, and for a week or a fortnight together.</P>
<P>These light flying Showers answer no
end, do little or no Good; the Sun dryes
it up as fast as it wetted, and (by the long
intervals between) all the benefit is lost; the
Ground remains hard, steril and barren still,
'tis all one as a drought.</P>
<P>But would the same quantity of Rain
fall all in one Shower, was there a weight
of Water sufficient to set Nature at Work,
sink down to the Root, and duly mois∣ten
the Plants, give drink to the thirsty
Earth, and set the Prisoners free, (I mean
the Seeds which lye bak'd and block'd up
in the Earth, and cannot get out) then the
Earth is refresh'd, and every thing thrives
and flourishes as it shou'd do.</P>
<P>I think the simile is very just; a small
body of People do nothing, as to this Arti∣cle
of Trade; I say they do nothing; they
do not Influence Trade, even in proporti∣on
to their Numbers; like a small stream of
Water to a Mill, it not only will not make
the Wheel go, at a slower and a propor∣tion'd
rate, but it runs by, or under it, goes
<PB N="140" REF="454"/>
off in wast, and does not make the Mill <HI>go
at all;</HI> It runs all away to no purpose.</P>
<P>Here a small City, and there a large
Town, they are good to depend upon the
Capital, and to have the Capital, in ma∣ny
things, depend upon them; but they
are not able to substitute a Capital, and to
stand in the room of it; when they come
to have the general Body, the whole Na∣tion's
Trade depend upon them, instead of
a capital City, then they are nothing at all,
they are of no Importance.</P>
<P>They tell us <HI>France</HI> is so situated by the
assistance of navigable Rivers, that there
are two and forty large Cities, which have
all a Communication with the great City
of <HI>Paris</HI> by Water, either by Sea or River
Navigation; and what is the consequence?
Not that these Cities make <HI>Paris</HI> great
and Rich, but that all these Cities are made
rich and great by the City of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>I say the same of <HI>London,</HI> tho' not as to
River Navigation; but the whole Kingdom
of <HI>England</HI> by its Communication with
<HI>London,</HI> is the same; it is not the Kingdom
makes <HI>London</HI> rich, but the City of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
makes all the Kingdom rich.</P>
<P>The Country corresponds with the City,
but the City corresponds with all the World;
the Country supplies the City with Corn
and Cattle, that is to say, with Provisions;
yes, and if there was not such a City to
<PB N="141" REF="455"/>
take off and consume them, what wou'd the
Country do? How must the product of the
Land be sold? how the Rent paid? the Land
must lye wast and uncultivated, the Cattle
would run Wild, and devour the Country,
or be starv'd and dye: The Country sends
up their Corn, their Malt, their Cattle,
their Fowls, their Coals, their Fish all to
<HI>London;</HI> and <HI>London</HI> sends back Spice, Su∣gar,
Wine, Druggs, Cotton, Linen, To∣bacco,
and all foreign necessaries to the
Country; and above all the rest that useful
drug call'd <HI>Money;</HI> so that still 'tis the capi∣tal
City that is the life of the Country,
and keeps them all in motion.</P>
<P>Again, the Countrymen sheer their Sheep,
sell their Wool, carry it from Place to Place;
the Manufacturers set it to work, to Comb∣ing,
Carding, Spining, Winding, Twisting,
Dying, Weaving, Fulling, Dressing, and thus
they finish their numberless Manufactures;
But what must they do with them, what
could a <HI>Madrid,</HI> or a <HI>Bristol</HI> do for them?
<HI>Bristol</HI> could take off some, indeed, and does
export a Proportion with its Neighbours;
but <HI>London</HI> is the Center of the gross body
of Manufacture, <HI>London</HI> answers the end
of every Trade Abroad, and of every Ma∣nufacture
at Home; be it <HI>Manchester</HI> for
Cotton-ware, <HI>Yorkshire</HI> for coarse Cloth,
Kersies, <HI>&amp;c. Wilts</HI> and <HI>Gloucester</HI> for fine
Cloths, <HI>Norwich</HI> for Stuffs, <HI>Wales</HI> for
<PB N="142" REF="456"/>
Flannels, all goes to <HI>London,</HI> and all have
their Money in return from <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><HI>London</HI> consumes all, circulates all, ex∣ports
all, and at last pays for all, and this
is Trade; this greatness and wealth of the
City is the Soul of the Commerce to all the
Nation; and as there is the greatest num∣ber
of Tradesmen in this City, that are to
be seen in any Place in the World; so they
again support, and supply an innumerable
number of Shopkeepers and Tradesmen of
every kind in the Country, and in every part
of the Country.</P>
<P>It may be thought a little assuming to say,
the City supports the Tradesmen of the
Country, but the fact is plain; you cannot
go to a Shopkeeper of any Note in the re∣motest
Town in <HI>England,</HI> but he holds
some correspondence at <HI>London;</HI> or else
he must be a mean Tradesman, that buys
his Goods of some of his better furnish'd
Neighbours, and they buy at <HI>London;</HI> so
that the other may be said to buy at <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
too, only he does it at second Hand.</P>
<P>Nor is this all; but, as all these Country
Tradesmen buy at <HI>London,</HI> so they all are
in debt at <HI>London</HI> more or less; they all
owe the <HI>London</HI> Shopkeepers Money; so
that the whole Country may in some re∣spects
be said to Trade upon the City's stock,
the <HI>London</HI> Tradesmen giving them all Cre∣dit.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="457"/>
It is indeed a little remote from the sub∣ject
of inland Trade, or else 'tis very remark∣able
and worth our observing, that the Ci∣ty
of <HI>London</HI> Trades with such an immense
Stock, that it may be said they give Cre∣dit
to all the World; all the Trades they
carry on Abroad, almost in every part of
the World, are carried on by the strength
of their Stocks; They do not receive
the Goods from Abroad, and so make the
returns back to the several Countries from
whence they come; but they send their own
Goods first out, and receive the Goods of
other Counries back in payment.</P>
<P>Thus in all the Ports of <HI>Spain, Portugal, Italy</HI> and <HI>Turkey,</HI> the Merchants of <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
have their Houses (as they call them)
there; the Warehouses are pil'd full up to
the Ceilings with <HI>English</HI> Bales; <HI>Eng∣lish</HI>
Stocks carry on the Trade; in a word,
we give Credit to all the World.</P>
<P>Not a Fleet of <HI>Portuguese</HI> Ships from the
<HI>Brasils</HI> not the Galleons of Flota from <HI>New-Spain,</HI>
but the Gold of the first, and the Sil∣ver
of the last, or at least a great share of
it, is the product of <HI>English</HI> Stocks, and
belongs to <HI>London</HI> Merchants, whose
Goods sold upon Credit at <HI>Lisbon</HI> and <HI>Ca∣diz,</HI>
went first out to <HI>America</HI> to purchase
that Gold and Silver.</P>
<P>Not a <HI>Turkey</HI> Fleet, or a Ship from <HI>Leg∣horn,
Messina,</HI> or <HI>Genoa,</HI> how rich soever
<PB N="144" REF="458"/>
frieghted with the finest raw and Thrown
Silk, the choicest Druggs and Gums, but
'tis all the Effects of the Merchants of <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
and in return for Credit first given by
the City of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>It is the like in the Plantation Trade, all
the <HI>New-England</HI> Trade, the <HI>Jamaica</HI> Trade,
the <HI>Barbadoes</HI> Trade, 'tis all carried on by
the Stocks of the <HI>English</HI> Merchants.</P>
<P>The Sugars, the Tobacco's, the Furrs, the
Turpentine, the Cocoa, the Indigo, and all
the rest of the Produce of our Colonies,
it comes Home in return from all those
Islands for the Goods long before consign'd
to them from <HI>London;</HI> so that in a Word
almost all the Plantations are managed up∣on
the Stocks and Substance of the Citi∣zens
of <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>To bring it all back to what I observ'd
before; as this vast correspondence Abroad
is thus carried on by the City of <HI>London</HI>
upon its own Stock, and they give Credit
to all the World; so when those returns
come back, they disperse all those Goods
again among the Country Tradesmen, and
give them Credit too; and this is the Effect
of a capital City: A capital City carries
on a capital Trade, and enriches, and em∣ploys
the whole Country, which if the
same People dwelt in a divided and se∣parate
Capacity, wou'd not be the Case
at all.</P>
<P><PB N="145" REF="459"/>
So many Deductions must be made from
the Home Trade, that thousands, nay hun∣dreds
of thousands of People now employ'd
in Collecting the Commerce thus to one
place, would then be left without Business,
and by consequence without Bread; as in
the Country, if the Sheep fed all about the
Farmers Houses as the Swine do, or were
Domesticks like their Dogs, and not in
Flocks, requiring to be tended and direct∣ed,
there wou'd be no employ for all the
Shepherds, which in the West and Northern
parts of <HI>England</HI> are maintain'd by keep∣ing,
and waiting upon, and folding them;
so the necessary Attendance upon the Trade,
as it all goes up to, and comes back from <HI>Lon∣don,</HI>
how many thousands of People does
it Employ?</P>
<P>It is ordinarily said, that there are 30000
Higglers, and Travelling Market Folks, as
we call them, about this City, a poor sort
of People that are wholly employ'd to
bring Butter, Eggs, Pigeons, Fowls, Chic∣kens,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> to <HI>London</HI> Market, and bring
Veal and Pork, and smaller things up and
down, from House to House, and every one
of them have a Horse, some more, some
Carts; some of them come forty or fifty
Miles; these wou'd be all out of Business,
except only such as lived within four, or
five, or six Miles of the Place.</P>
<P>The like of Gardiners, whose numbers
are now, within a few Years, so prodigious∣ly
<PB N="146" REF="460"/>
encreased, and who now keep Carts and
whole Teams of Horses, or large Luggage
Boats upon the River, and Employ an In∣credible
quantity of Land for ten Miles
distance round the City; whereas were it a
<HI>Bristol</HI> or an <HI>Excester,</HI> no such thing wou'd
be remov'd above a Mile from the place,
nor so many Horses and Servants be em∣ploy'd
by nineteen in twenty.</P>
<P>These are some of the Benefits of a ca∣pital
City, as to Trade: I might give a great
many Examples, of other Advantages, which
a conflux of People necessarily bring with
it; but it is enough, the Magnitude of the
<HI>English</HI> inland Commerce is a Testimony
of it; the Influence of the City upon it all
has evidently been not the support only,
but the very Birth and Foundation of the
Trade itself.</P>
<P>The City of <HI>London</HI> is such a Fund of
Commerce, as indeed cannot be describ'd in
a narrow compass; the Tradesmen of it,
however degenerated, and whatever deficien∣cies
may be found in their Conduct as such,
yet it must be acknowledg'd, they carry on
as great a Trade as ever, and perhaps a
greater, nor can it be disputed, but that their
Trade encreases every Day.</P>
<P>It may indeed be true, that the encrease
of Crime is the encrease of Commerce,
and the Wickedness of the time is the
Blessing of the Trade; the Vanity, the
<PB N="147" REF="461"/>
Luxury, the Folly, and even the Vice of the
People is the cause of that encrease, or at
least, part of it, <HI>as I have said already;</HI> but
the fact is still true, that the Trade is en∣creas'd,
and that in a surprising manner;
as to the Error of it, that is not our present
Business, the morality of the Tradesmen's
Conduct upon that account is indeed an
Article by it self, and I shall take some No∣tice
of it in our next Chapter.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="5" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of such Tradesmen who by the neces∣sary
Consequences of their Business
are oblig'd to be accessary to the
Propagation of Vice, and the En∣crease
of the Wickedness of the
Times, and that all the Immorality
of the Age is not occasion'd by the
Ale-houses and the Taverns.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a very melancholy Reflection, for
an honest Tradesmen to make, that by
the Consequence of his Trade, which is his
lawful Calling, he may be a Tool in the
hand of the Devil to prompt and propagate
the Vice, and encreasing immoralities of the
Times, and of the Country where he lives.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may think now, I am go∣ing
<PB N="148" REF="462"/>
to run out here in a long Exclamation
against the several Professions or Trades,
which are made Instruments of Crime; as
Alehouse-Keepers, Tavern-Keepers, and such
like People, whose Houses are too often the
receptacles and retreats of Lewdness and
Gaming, as well as Drunkenness, and other
Excesses; and to reproach them with their
Professions as such: But you will be Mis∣taken;
a Vintner or a Victualler may, if he
pleases, keep as regular a House, and as good
order in it, as any other Man; so that it
is not his Profession that is the cause of
the Scandal; but if he does not, at least as
far as his own Government extends (and
I cannot say he is answerable for any more)
the Man is the Criminal, not the Trade, and
I shall explain my self more particularly pre∣sently.</P>
<P>But
the Sumptuary Trades, on the other
hand, cannot do this; and such of them
whose whole Employ has a natural and di∣rect
tendency to the Propagation of our Ex∣cesses
of several sorts, these are of another
nature; and there the Tradesman is natu∣rally
the very immediate Instrument in the
Vice, the Instigator, I may say, the Tempter.</P>
<P>And what shall we say, while we are
come to an Age, when, as I hinted just now,
the national Vices are become Virtues in
Trade, and the flourishing of so many
thousand Shop-Keepers, so many rich Ma∣nufacturers,
<PB N="149" REF="463"/>
and the Employment of so
many millions of poor People is the mere
Effect of abominable Luxury and Pride;
such as that of Dress, of Furniture; of change
of Fashion, of delicacies in Dyet, Eat∣ing,
Drinking, and the like.</P>
<P>Every Taylor invents Fashions, the Mer∣cer
studies new Patterns, the Weaver forms
them into beautiful and gay Figures, and
stores himself with a vast variety to allure
the fancy; the Coach-maker contrives new
Machines, Chairs, Berlins, Flyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all to
prompt the Whim<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies, and unaccounta∣ble
Pride of the Gentry, and draw them or
lead them into uncommon Extravagancies;
changing their Equipages as often as fancy,
not necessity directs.</P>
<P>The Upholder does the like in Furniture,
till he draws the gay Ladies to such an Ex∣cess
of Folly, that they must have their
Houses new furnish'd every Year; every
thing that has been longer than a Year in
use must be call'd old, and to have their
fine Lodgings seen by Persons of any Fi∣gure
above twice over, looks ordinary and
mean.</P>
<P>It wou'd take up a Book of itself to give
a due Measure of Satyr to the surprizing
folly of our People, especially the Gentry,
who, as if their Estates were too great, and
that they knew not which way to dispose
of their Money fast enough, suffer the Trades∣men,
<PB N="150" REF="464"/>
as above, to guide their Vanity by the
artifice of Words, making them dislike their
richest Clothes, Equipages and Furniture,
fancying them out of Fashion, and not fit to
be seen, only that the Upholder, the Coach∣maker,
or the Taylor may furnish new, and
be paid for it.</P>
<P>The present Case is not directed to the
Ladies and Beaus who are thus wheedl'd and
drawn in, or to the folly of the Times, in be∣ing
subject to be so ridiculously impos'd up∣on,
but to the Tradesmen whose business sub∣sists
upon the Practice of such Arts, at least the
success and prosperity of their Business often
depend upon it.</P>
<P>As the Vanities of the People encrease
Trade, so the Craft of these Tradesmen en∣crease
the Vanity of the People; I must re∣fer
it to Principle, if upon sedate Reflecti∣on
it can be reconcil'd to their Thoughts,
if it sits easie upon their Consciences, they
must go on; but I wou'd recommend it to
such Tradesmen to act with some Caution
in these Cases, with respect to the Days of
reflection which may be perhaps a great way
off, but will certainly come.</P>
<P>There is a just Impartiality which a
Tradesman may observe between his In∣terest
and his Customer; if the Buyer comes
and directs him to make this or that parti∣cular
thing, of such and such materials, and
in such and such a form, it is his Business to
<PB N="151" REF="465"/>
perform it, and the Extravagance is indeed
the Fop's that Imposes it upon him.</P>
<P>But we have some Tradesmen who rack
Invention to bring something into the
World more than ordinarily whimsical and
extravagant, to allure and fall in with the
most stupid and easily abus'd humour of the
Time; if this takes, that Man values him∣self
upon being the Inventor of this new
thing; if possible gets it call'd by his own
Name, and the Town runs after it, in the
excess of their Folly, even to distraction.</P>
<P>This Man values himself upon it, gets
a fame by it that answers his end in Trade,
and brings a profit inexpressible; then he
sets up for a <HI>Fashion-Monger,</HI> and then the
meanest things go down with the fancy of
the abused People only upon the name of
the Man. Such was the <HI>Doyly</HI> Stuffs, well
known in the Town some Years ago, and
which tho' a trifle in itself, yet set the Beaus
a dressing in the meanest and most foolish
trash, and which was neither more or less
than the grossest piece of Imposition of its
kind that ever went down with the Town.</P>
<P>It may be true, that this was no Exam∣ple
of Vice indeed, but of Folly, and that
these Follies create Trade; but the Excesses
mentioned above, carry these Follies to a
greater height, even till they become Cri∣minal
to the Families concern'd in them,
while the Persons run in Debt for their Gaie∣ty,
<PB N="152" REF="466"/>
and wound their Estates to make a shew
in their Houses.</P>
<P>Here the fine tall Oaks, nay Woods of
them are fell'd to raise the Equipage of the
Family, and the Fields are stript without
Doors to line the Mansion House within:
In a Word, the Children are starv'd to be
made Gay, made Beggars to be fine, and poor
only to look as if they were rich; if the
Woods cease to supply, they Borrow, Mort∣gage,
run in Debt, and at last go a begging
too, for the pleasure of going fine; and if
the Luxury of the present Age does not fill
the <HI>Fleet,</HI> and <HI>Kings-Bench</HI> Prisons with Ba∣ronets,
and Esquires, the Court with Cham∣bermaids
of Quality, and the Army with
eldest Sons instead of younger Brothers, it
must be prevented by some Extraordinary
Change of Management in the World,
which in an Age where Reformation is so
much out of Fashion can hardly be expected.</P>
<P>Now this is the way of Living that makes
Trade, which by the way is the only good
it can be said to do; but how the Trades∣men
who propagate this in order to form
their private Interest, can justify that Prac∣tice
to their own Principles, or can pretend
to have any pretences to Principles, that
Merits to be considered.</P>
<P>This I must acknowledge is in my Opi∣nion
a much worse Article in, and has a far
greater tendency to debauching the Morals
<PB N="153" REF="467"/>
of the People, than the Ale-house and the
Brandy-shop; for the Luxury of the rich is,
in my Opinion, much worse than the Drunk∣enness
of the Poor; and has a Tendency to
much worse things, which I could make out
at large, but that is not my present subject.</P>
<P>But it Propagates Trade, and that is my
subject: Pray let us examine a little into
the manner, and some of the Consequences
of this, I mean in Trade, for that is the Point.</P>
<P>'Tis True, the growing Wealth of the
Town, and the Gaiety of Dress have advanc∣ed
the Silk Manufacture to a prodigy, in
which the Improvement of Fancy runs on
to bear a share: The Weaver's Art is so
encouraged by this, that now we make at
home all the fine Broad-silks, Velvets, Bro∣cades,
Damasks, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which formerly came
from <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> Above twelve hun∣dred
thousand pounds a Year, which by the
strictest Calculation was formerly paid to the
<HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Genoese, &amp;c.</HI> for wrought
Silks, is now all kept at Home, and ex∣pended
among our own Poor; so far the
effect in Trade is very good.</P>
<P>But observe the difficulty upon the Trades∣men,
the known humour of the Peo∣ple
of this Nation, (more perhaps than of
any other in the World,) is to despise the
Growth or Product of their own Country,
and give the most Extravagant Prices for
Foreign Manufactures, whether better in
<PB N="154" REF="468"/>
kind or not: Now what's the consequence
of this, the Mercers find out the soft place,
the Ladies will allow nothing but <HI>French</HI>
to be fit for a Person of Quality to wear;
if you offer them the richest Silk, the most
beautiful Pattern, the most agreeable Co∣lours,
if it has the Scandal of being <HI>Eng∣lish,</HI>
it must not have the honour to come
upon their Backs, there's the original Vice:
'Tis founded in humour.</P>
<P>The Mercer has two or three ingenious
Workmen, Master Weavers in <HI>Spittlefields,</HI>
who are Men of exquisite Art, clean
Heads, and bright Fancies in their Business;
these Men so far outdo the <HI>French,</HI> that
nothing comes from <HI>France</HI> equal to what
they perform here.</P>
<Q><HI>N. B.</HI> Thus far the Trade is improv'd,
and the Silk Manufacture in <HI>England</HI>
nobly advanc'd; and this Trade might
perhaps be carry'd on without Crime,
as much as any Trade that relates to
dress and the gaiety of Apparel.</Q>
<P>But the Mercer finding how the hu∣mour
of the Town goes, he sets these
skilful Artists to Work, and to rack their
Invention for new out-of-the-way Fancies
and Patterns of Silks, such (to be sure) as
have not been seen in the Town before;
the Workmanship is exquisitely good, the
<PB N="155" REF="469"/>
Silk rich and weighty, the Brocades thick
and high, and the Patterns flaming in Fan∣cy;
these the Mercer keeps in Petto, and
when the Ladies have with disdain look'd
upon all the fine Things a well furnish'd
Shop can produce, and are as it were just
going out of his Door, the cunning Trades∣man,
well furnish'd with a Stock in his Face,
as well as in his Shop, an oyly Tongue and
a case-harden'd Conscience, takes the Ladies
to one Corner of the Shop, and whisper∣ing,
as if he was afraid any one shou'd hear
what he desired every one shou'd know,
he makes 'em this formal Speech with the
utmost Assurance, and not one Word of
Truth in it.</P>
<Q><P>“Madam, says he, I can indeed shew
you some very fine <HI>French</HI> Silks, but
your Ladyship knows there is some
hazard in that part of our Business,
and we dare not shew them publickly
in our Shop; besides, very few Ladies
will go to the Price of them: But I
dare so far depend upon your Lady∣ship's
Honour, that you will not do me
any Injury if you shou'd not Buy.”</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> With this he Invites them into
an Inner-shop, or perhaps up Stairs in∣to
his dining Room, and there he
goes on with the Cheat.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> 'Tis to be observ'd also, that 'tis
<PB N="156" REF="470"/>
an original falshood in Fact; for the
<HI>French</HI> Silks are by him supposed to be
run, or as we call it smuggled; that is,
got on shore without paying Duties;
so that he is liable to be inform'd
against, and have the Goods seized;
whereas the Goods come no more
from <HI>France,</HI> than the Mercer.</P></Q>
<P>The Ladies taken with this Bite, and per∣fectly
drawn into the snare, follow the Mer∣cer
into his retreat, and there he produces
the Extraordinaries he pretends to; the La∣dies
are surpriz'd with the Silks, that's the
first Article; for they are really fine, rich,
new, charming in every respect, and well
worth their not liking only, but admiring.</P>
<P>The first question the Ladies ask is, if they
are really <HI>French,</HI> the Mercer makes no
scruple to affirm they are, and perhaps
swears to it: But fails not to add another
black Article, <HI>Yes,</HI> Madam, <HI>French!</HI> your
Ladyship may depend upon it, <HI>they are
French; we can make no such Things as these
in England.</HI> There are two direct falshoods
by way of Preliminary, besides laying a scan∣dal
upon his Country, as if we were not
able to come up to the <HI>French,</HI> or any o∣ther
Nation in the Perfection of the Ma∣nufacture;
whereas 'tis known we go be∣yond
them in every branch of the Trade,
<PB N="157" REF="471"/>
and in every particular Article of the Per∣formance.</P>
<P>But this is not all, for the grand Cheat
is behind, and 'tis not a Cheat only, but 'tis
a complicated fraud; dress'd, and set out with
so many downright falshoods, that 'tis like
a Silver Watch gilded, and then set out with
false Diamonds, so that no Body but a Per∣son
well skill'd in the Fraud can perceive
the Cheat.</P>
<P>The next thing the Lady asks is the Price;
the cunning Tradesman smiles, shakes his
Head, and with a world of Grimace tells
her, indeed, Madam, I am almost afraid to
tell your Ladyship the Price: But 'tis what
we can't help; these things will be always
dear, because they are so difficult to be had,
and so much hazard attends it; Indeed, Ma∣dam,
I cannot say they are cheap; and then
he stops, and takes Breath a little; not that
the matter of what he has said, which has
not a word of Truth in it, is in any danger
of being discover'd, or as we say, in like
cases, that a L—would choak him, or en∣danger
his Lungs: But to give the Lady
time to swallow and digest the gross things
already said to her.</P>
<P>Well, says the Lady, but let's hear it how∣ever,
let's know the Price; upon which ha∣ving
prepar'd her for the extravagant de∣mand,
he asks her 35 <HI>s.</HI> a Yard, with an
Assurance not to be describ'd, tho' cover'd
<PB N="158" REF="472"/>
at first, and dress'd up with the Appearance
of all possible sincerity and modesty.</P>
<P>The Price thus broke, the Lady starts a
little at it at first, but is drawn in gradual∣ly
to it, by the Repetition of all those Trad∣ing
L—s we mentioned before; and be∣ing
assured by the Mercer, that it is a right
<HI>French</HI> Silk, and was brought over from
<HI>France</HI> with a great deal of difficulty and
hazard, she comes up to his Price within a∣bout
half a Crown a Yard; so he sells her
the Silk as a vast favour, a great Penny∣worth,
lays a great Obligation upon her
Ladyship for the particular respect shewn her
in venturing to shew it her at all; and claims
an Interest in her favour for her self and
her friends, for their future coming to his
Shop.</P>
<P>And now after all this Grimace, as I
think it may be justly call'd, here are three
or four things in it worth our Notice.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Here is a stated established form of
Cheating and Falshood, set up as a Rule
of Trade, and what the Mercer resolves
upon as a Practice in the Course of
his Business.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Here is a fatal national folly encourag∣ed,
and in its own Imagination grati∣fied
too; tho' the Person is deceiv'd,
and most egregiously imposed upon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Here is a most immoderate gain made
<PB N="159" REF="473"/>
by the Fraud, which indeed is the
grand Incentive and Provokative to
the Crime.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Here is general Trade propagated by a
double Crime; <HI>the first,</HI> against Man
in the foolish depressing a useful home
Manufacture, discouraging Trade, de∣priving
the Poor of our own Coun∣try,
and affecting the Labours of Fo∣reigners;
<HI>and the second,</HI> against Truth,
and the Author of Truth; in pushing
on Business at the expence of our Mo∣rals,
and with a Chain of accumulat∣ed
Falshood and Prevarication.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>What can the Tradesmen say for this?
who wou'd be a rich Man at this Price,
and how do these things give Life to the
general Scandal upon Business, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that
a Tradesman cannot be an honest Man?
The Mercer makes his Market by the Fraud,
that's true; he sells this Silk for 32 <HI>s. 6 d.</HI>
a Yard, which he could very well afford,
for 18 to 20, or 22 <HI>s.</HI> and gain an honest
Profit too.</P>
<P>Now what must we say to those Trades∣men,
whose Business seems to lay them
under the necessity of this way of acting;
how do they, as I said above, not only
prompt and draw People on in the popular
Vice of <HI>over gay Dress,</HI> and Excesses in ha∣bit,
but prostitute Principle to propagate
<PB N="160" REF="474"/>
Crime, and sacrifice Conscience to support
the Luxurious Temper? for Excess of Orna∣ment
is a Luxury in Habit, as well as Eat∣ing
and Drinking.</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be hard to persuade the
Tradesmen that this is a Crime, and could
it be abstracted from the plain Cheat, and
the black addenda of Falshood and L—ing,
it would be still more difficult; but as the
Offences cannot be separated, so the re∣proach
cannot be resisted.</P>
<P>But what must be done? whatever Manu∣facture
is discourag'd, the Manufacture of
Cheating ought not to be encourag'd to
prevent it: If Trade cannot be carried on
without sending the Tradesmen to the <HI>De∣vil,</HI>
the <HI>Devil</HI> shou'd come and open Shop
himself, rather than any honest Men shou'd
Trade for him, as these do, and at such a
price, raise their Fortunes under his Con∣duct;
for indeed in such Cases, 'tis little bet∣ter
than the <HI>Devil</HI> driving the Trade, and
the Tradesmen's being the <HI>Devils</HI> Journey∣men;
they certainly carry on the Trade for
him, and he pays them board Wages; thus
the Tradesmen get the Money, and the
<HI>Devil</HI> gets the Tradesmen.</P>
<P>On the other hand, wou'd the Mer∣cer
act the honest Part, that is, first be honest
to their Country, and to the Manufucture
wrought at Home, as in one respect, they
really ought to do, and propagate our own
<PB N="161" REF="475"/>
Manufactures with their utmost Endeavour,
refusing Universally to sell any <HI>French</HI> or
Foreign Silks, which really and <HI>Bona fide</HI>
there is no manner of need of; and wou'd
they at the same time tell the Ladies plain∣ly,
that <HI>France</HI> cannot furnish any thing fi∣ner,
richer, more beautiful, or more agree∣able
than is made by our own Weavers,
and that all these charming Patterns, fine Co∣lours,
rich Brocades, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are made at Home
and are inimitable from Abroad as is most
true.</P>
<P>Wou'd they do thus, I say, as honest Deal∣ings
claim they shou'd do, they would effec∣tually
suppress the foolish humour of de∣spising
our own Manufacture, which is so
general among the People, and in a little
time our own Weavers wou'd advance their
Improvements to such a Degree, as to send
their wrought Silks Abroad, even to <HI>France</HI>
itself.</P>
<P>I come now to mention the turn which
the Luxury of our People has given to Trade
in some other particulars, which will lead
the Tradesmen to the like just Reflections.</P>
<P>The Face of Trade has its new turns in
the Heads of the People, within these few
Years to such a Degree, that it is worth our
Reflections, and we may draw many useful
Inferences from it, in the very subject I am
upon.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="476"/>
Let any Man whose Years and Strength
of Head allow him to look back, and to
remember how things stood in <HI>London</HI> a∣bout
forty to fifty Years ago, and let him
but consider the Face of the City in those
Days, and how it is now; I mean with re∣spect
of Trade only, for I keep close to my
Text.</P>
<P>The Mercers were few in number, but
great Dealers; <HI>Pater <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> noster Row</HI> was the
Center of their Trade; that Street was built
for them, the spacious Shops, back Ware-houses,
Skie-lights, and other Conveniences
made on purpose for the Trade are still to
be seen, and the Stocks they had were pro∣digious
great.</P>
<P>As were the Tradesmen, so was the
Trade; the Street was throng'd, the Coach∣es
were oblig'd to stand in two rows, one
side to go in, and the other to go out, for
there was no turning, and the Mercers kept
two Beadles to keep the order of the Street;
any one may see and judge what Num∣bers
the Street could hold, about fifty prin∣cipal
Shops took up the whole, the rest
were Dependents, as Lace-Men about the
middle near <HI>Ivy-lane,</HI> the Button-shops at
the end of the Street next <HI>Cheapside,</HI> and
the Cruel-shops, Silk-men and Fringe-shops,
near at hand in <HI>Blow-bladder-street.</HI></P>
<P>They held it in this Figure about twen∣ty
Years after the Fire, and not more, and
<PB N="163" REF="477"/>
even in that time, the number encreasing as
the gay humour came on, we saw outly∣ing
Mercers set up about <HI>Aldgate,</HI> the East
end of <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> and <HI>Covent-garden:</HI>
In a few Years more <HI>Covent-garden</HI> began
to get a name, and at length by degrees
intercepted the Quality so much, the Streets
also being large and commodious for Coach∣es,
that the Court came no more into the Ci∣ty
to buy Clothes; on the contrary, the Ci∣tizens
ran to the East and West; <HI>Pater-noster
Row</HI> began to be deserted and abandon'd of
its Trade, and in less than two Years the
Mercers began to forsake the Place, and
follow the Trade, seeing the Trade wou'd
not follow them; as at Sea, if the shoals of
Fish shift their usual station, the Fishermen
follow the Fish, not the Fish the Fishermen.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pater-noster Row</HI> Mercers, as I re∣member,
went all away to <HI>Covent-garden,</HI>
and there for some Years was the Center of
Trade; reserving some still within <HI>Aldgate,</HI>
and at the Corners of <HI>Lombard</HI> and <HI>Fen-Church
-Street,</HI> and within <HI>Lombard street,</HI>
as far as to <HI>Clements-lane</HI> End, and in the
Lane the Button-makers, who followed like∣wise
from <HI>Pater-noster Row.</HI></P>
<P>Within about ten Years more the Trade
shifted again; <HI>Covent-garden</HI> began to de∣cline,
and the Mercers encreasing prodigi∣ously
went back into the City; there like
Bees unhiv'd they hover about a while,
<PB N="164" REF="478"/>
not knowing where to fix; but at last, as if
they would come back to the old Hive in
<HI>Pater-noster Row,</HI> but could not be admit∣ted,
the swarm settled on <HI>Lugate-hill.</HI></P>
<P>How they are encreased there, how they
spead themselves within the Gate as well as
without, and take up both sides of the
way from the Ditch almost to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s,
except such Houses as could not be had;
how they are spread in lesser swarms, and
settled in other Places, as at <HI>Round court,
Fen-Church-street,</HI> and <HI>Hounds-ditch,</HI> this
I need not mention.</P>
<P>This change of the Face of the Trade,
and encrease of the number of Mercers,
I do not take to inferr a proportion'd in∣crease
of the Trade, tho' the Trade is cer∣tainly
encreas'd too, as the numbers, and
Pride, and Wealth, of the People are en∣creas'd;
but not, I say, in proportion to the
numbers of Mercers, whose numbers, instead
of about fifty to sixty, which they were in
the Year 1663, may now be call'd about
three or four hundred.</P>
<P>This will the better appear, when I shall
tell you that there has not been the like
number of Bankrupts of any Trade in the
whole City of <HI>London,</HI> as of the Mercers, for
these 30 Years past; and that as I am inform∣ed,
there is not a Mercer's Shop on all <HI>Lud∣gate-hill,</HI>
and <HI>Ludgate street,</HI> out of which
there has not one Mercer or more broke,
<PB N="165" REF="479"/>
since the Swarm, as I said, first settled there;
whereas in <HI>Pater-noster Row</HI> they all grew
Rich, and very seldom any fail'd or mis∣carried.</P>
<P>But to go on with my view of the Face
of Trade in the City, since the Mercers re∣moved
from <HI>Pater-noster Row,</HI> as above;
we have seen almost all the Collections of
Tradesmen, who appear'd in whole Streets
before, separated and dispers'd, except the
Shoe-makers, and even those are not so
congregated in Rows as formerly; for Ex∣ample:</P>
<P>How are the great Woollen-Drapers se∣parated
from St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard, the
Sales-Men from <HI>Birchin-lane,</HI> the wholesale
Upholsterers on the South-side of <HI>Cornhill,</HI>
the Bankers in <HI>Lombard-street,</HI> the Cake∣shops
in <HI>Wood-street,</HI> even the Butchers in
great and little <HI>East-cheap,</HI> almost all dis∣pers'd
and gone? We see <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-yard
fill'd with Cane Chair-makers on one side;
<HI>Cornhill</HI> with the meanest of Trades, such
as Coffee-houses, Perriwig-makers, Pattern∣shops
and Pastry-cooks; even <HI>Cheapside</HI> it
self, formerly famous for capital Traders, and
the most flourishing wholesale Dealers as
well as Shop-Keepers, how do we see it now
fill'd up with Shoe makers, Milleners, Toy∣shops,
and Pastry-cooks? And had not the
Linen-Drapers, whose Business also, as
well as Numbers, is monstrously encreas∣ed,
<PB N="166" REF="480"/>
took that Street, it had been all dwind∣led
into Pedling, and Petty Trade.</P>
<P>The like turn appears in the two great
Centers of the Women Merchants; I mean
the Exchange Shops; particularly at the <HI>Roy∣al
Exchange,</HI> and the <HI>New-Exchange</HI> in the
<HI>Strand;</HI> both these we saw full of Flourish∣ing
Shops of the Millenary kin<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>: But now
we see all the upper part of the <HI>New Ex∣change,</HI>
turn'd into a Looking-Glass Ware∣house,
the several Divisions of the <HI>Royal-Exchange</HI>
turn'd into Offices of Assurance,
Rooms for publick Sales, and the like; and
the Millenary Trade separated into innu∣merable
little Commode Shops, Head Dres∣sers
and such like People, yet taking Shops
in the most publick parts of the City.</P>
<P>Now to observe whence all this squan∣dring
of the Tradesmen proceeded, 'tis evi∣dent
it came from the encrease of the Gaie∣ty
and profuse Humour, which I call the Lux∣ury
of the Times; as this temper of the Peo∣ple
encreas'd, and the numbers also of the
People thronging to the City made a more
than common encrease of Customers, by the
same rule the numbers of these Trades like∣wise
encreas'd, and became too great for the
several Places where they were formerly,
as it may be said, Confin'd.</P>
<P>Hence the wholesale Drapers formerly
centred in <HI>Cornhill,</HI> and among the Whole∣sale
Country Dealers in <HI>Bread-street,</HI> and
<PB N="167" REF="481"/>
<HI>Friday-street</HI> are spread so extreamly, that
the Northside of <HI>Cheapside</HI> seems to be
one great row of Drapers shops, the Bankers
spread from <HI>Lombard-street</HI> to <HI>Temple-bar,</HI>
and then to <HI>Charing-cross,</HI> and so of the
rest.</P>
<P>Again, the same flourishing of Pride has
dictated new Methods of Living to the Peo∣ple,
and while the poorest Citizens strive to
live like the Rich, the Rich like the Gentry,
the Gentry like the Nobility, and the No∣bility
striving to outshine one another, no
wonder that all the sumptuary Trades en∣crease;
that instead of ten or twelve Coach-makers
in the City, and not quite so many
at the other end of the Town, we have
the Company of Coach-makers incorporat∣ed,
and whole Streets of them set up toge∣ther;
as in <HI>Long-Acre,</HI> great <HI>Queen-street,</HI>
little <HI>Queen-street, Cow-lane, Bishopsgate-street,
Aldersgate-street,</HI> and many other
Places, where their numbers are hardly to be
reckoned up.</P>
<P>The like surprizing encrease of Perriwig-makers,
of whom including Barbers, they
tell us there's not less than 30000 in the
City and adjacent parts of <HI>London;</HI> all this
is occasion'd by that one Excess of wearing
Perriwigs, a thing little known in <HI>England</HI>
fifty Year ago, and not at all fourscore
Years ago.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="482"/>
Undertakers for Funerals, and the usage
of Burying with Coaches, tho' the party lies
Dead but two Doors off from the Church,
with all the frightful Geugaws of Funeral
Pomp, and the growing Extravagances of
new Customs in Funerals, how wonderful
a Foppery! and how are Families become
Slaves to what the Undertakers please to
call the Fashion in dressing both the Liv∣ing
and the Dead?</P>
<P>See next the universal Custom of wear∣ing
excessive fine Linen, not a Shop-Keep∣er,
not a Barber, not hardly a Barber's Pren∣tice,
but must have a Shirt of fine Holland of
6 s. an Ell, and the ordinary Beaus run it
up to 10 s. and 12 s. an Ell; their Grand∣fathers,
perhaps as clean, tho' not so gay, con∣tented
themselves with good Holland of half
the price, and with shifting their Linen
prehaps twice a week; to correct which
our nicer Gentlemen have brought it to
two clean Shirts a Day; we must suppose
their uncleaner Bodies require more than
those of their Ancestors did—</P>
<P>These are some of the modest Articles
which increase Trade, increase the Num∣bers
of Linen-drapers, and that not in <HI>Lon∣don</HI>
only, but all over <HI>England,</HI> and that have
brought Trade to this particular height;
namely, that <HI>England,</HI> tho' we make no
Linen of any value, yet wears more fine
Linen than not only the Countries where
<PB N="169" REF="483"/>
they are made, and where they are so much
cheaper than they are here, but even than
any other Country in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Now, as this is an Extravagance in Life,
and an Excess in its own Nature, as to the
expence of it, as well as to the ridiculous
Pageantry of it, so it makes a Vice in Trade;
those Linens being all bought from Abroad,
from <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Flanders,</HI> and the quan∣tity
imported is now so very great, that in
<HI>Flanders</HI> in particular they tell us, the <HI>Fle∣mings</HI>
trade with us with their Cambricks,
and other sorts of fine Linens, above an
hundred thousand pounds a Year to our loss
in the Ballance of Trade.</P>
<P>These are the Vices that propagate Trade,
and it was upon the Foundation of these,
that we ventur'd to say, our Vices are be∣come
Virtues in Commerce, propagate
Trade, Labour, Manufacture, and the en∣crease
of Employment of the Poor in all
parts of <HI>England,</HI> and even Abroad as well
as at Home.</P>
<P>I might enter upon a useful Enquiry here
with relation to this mighty Article call'd
Trade in <HI>England;</HI> whether as our Vices
seem to be come to a height, nay, I might
say to the highest, to the farthest extreme,
that it is possible they can be brought to,
whether our Trade is not brought to its
Meridian also. <HI>I must own I think it is,</HI>
and that as in all Cases of such a Nature,
<PB N="170" REF="484"/>
things decline when they are at their Ex∣tremes,
so Trade not only must decline, but
does already sensibly decline.</P>
<P>Our Manufactures decline, which is to our
Trade, as Bread is to the Body, the staff of
their Life; the Nations round us begin to
tast the sweetness of it, to see how we are
enrich'd by it, and they not only envy us,
but imitate us, and set their Inventions
upon the rack to supply their demands by
their own Labour, and so keep their Mo∣ney
at Home, which otherwise does, and
must come to <HI>England</HI> to purchase our Ma∣nufactures.</P>
<P>The
consequence is, that the <HI>English</HI>
Woollen Manufactures are prohibited in
many parts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and those Prohibiti∣ons
encrease every Day, <HI>France, Holland,
Prussia, Brandenburgh, Sweden, Saxony,
Swisserland, Austria, Bohemia, Piedmont,</HI>
all have set up Manufactures of their own;
and <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Swisserland,</HI> not only sup∣ply
their own People, but are able to ex∣port
large quantities for the use of other Na∣tions,
and already boldly supplant us at the
best Markets Abroad.</P>
<P>If this be our case, as I believe it's too ap∣parent
to all those who either are concern'd
<HI>in</HI> or <HI>for,</HI> or otherwise understand our Trade;
this is a natural Conclusion, and for which
indeed I name it, <HI>viz.</HI> That as the rising and
encrease of our Manufactures have raised
<PB N="171" REF="485"/>
the Wealth and Pride of this Nation to
the height which we at this time see it ar∣riv'd
to, the decay of those Manufactures,
will of course cause that Wealth to decay
also; whether our Pride will abate with it
or no, is none of my Business; but this leads
me to a natural Conclusion to the Com∣plete
Tradesman, to whom I have all along
directed my Speech, and with which I shall
close the whole Work.</P>
<DIV5 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>LET all the Tradesmen then and the
Dependants upon Trade in <HI>England</HI>
consider the infinite Moment it is to them
in Commerce, to promote, encourage and
support that Trade (I mean the inland Trade,
the home Trade of this Nation) by which
they are themselves all supported, and their
Poor maintain'd; <HI>and in a Word,</HI> by which
all the Branches of our Commerce are
brought to the present Immense greatness
in which they now appear, and of which
so much has been said: And that I may not
be thought to be Preaching Religion here,
instead of Trade, I shall clear my self of
that Scandal, by explaining my self in a few
Articles.</P>
<P>It is alledg'd, that if Vice is, as it too
plainly appears, so much the support of our
Trade, when I urge you to promote and sup∣port
<PB N="172" REF="486"/>
the Trade of the Nation, I tacitly in∣sinuate,
that we must Encourage our Vice
for the Encouragement of our Trade; but
this is such a Corrupt use of a just reason∣ing,
that it needs no great art to overthrow
it.</P>
<P>I make no doubt, but that notwithstand∣ing
all that has been said of our Vice pro∣pagating
our Commerce, yet our Trade
might be supported, our Tradesmen be kept
employ'd, and their Shops still be open'd,
tho' a Time of Reformation were to come,
which I doubt is but too far off.</P>
<P>Perhaps it wou'd at first give a turn to the
present situation of Home-Trade, and there
might be some little shock given to our
sumptuary Employments, and to those Shops
and Shambles of Vice, the Victualling
and Liquor Trades; but God forbid, that
we shou'd be understood to prompt the Ex∣cesses
of the Age, in order to preserve and
encrease that particular branch of Com∣merce.</P>
<P>I doubt not to shew the World, that we
are not obliged to run into Extremes and
Extravagancies in Dress to promote the Silk
Manufactures, to have our poor People turn
Sots and Drunkards, to promote the Malt
and Brewing Trade, or the rich to support
the Wine Trade; and so of other Madnesses
which are the present Grievances of the
Times.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="487"/>
The Silk Manufacture, as it is now improv∣ed
and made our own, is a very great help
to Trade, as well the Home Trade as the
Foreign Trade; and especially is a timely
relief to us, in the present evident decay
of our Woollen, which I call our National
Manufacture; and 'tis not only necessary to
us in Trade, but it is so in it self also;
nor is it to be all charg'd to the Account of
our Vice or our Pride: We may be as
Proud, and as Vain, and as Gay, as Luxuri∣ous,
and as Vitious in our Woollen Manu∣facture,
as in our Silk, and I doubt we are
so.</P>
<P>The Silk is ordinarily the wear and dress
of the Ladies, and I am not willing to be
so unjust, as to lay all the Pride at their
Doors. I doubt there is not so much Odds
between the Sexes as to Crime; but
that if they were all join'd in our account of
publick Follies, they would have little reason
to complain of partiality: But this is what I
think may be insisted on, a Reformation might
effect Trade in many particular things, but
need not overthrow and destroy it in general.</P>
<P>The Silk Manufacture might be very con∣siderable
in <HI>England,</HI> if the Ladies went a
little more modestly dress'd, if they were
a little less Curious, less Extravagant, less
Exotick, and abated a little of their Excesses.</P>
<P>The Wine Trade would still be very
Considerable, tho' the Gentlemen abated
<PB N="174" REF="488"/>
their immoderate Drinking, and went Home
now and then a little sooner, and a little
soberer.</P>
<P>The Malt and Brewing Trades, the Dis∣tilling
Spirits, and the Importation of Bran∣dy
might be still very great Articles in our
Trade, and all together be very great sup∣ports
to the publick Revenue, and to the
Government, tho' not so great as they now
are, if the number of Alehouses were a
little less, and tho' the Gin-shops and Bran∣dy-shops
were fewer by some thousands.</P>
<P>Trade need not be destroy'd, tho' Vice
were mortally wounded, much less need
we be oblig'd to encourage Flaming Luxu∣ry
for fear of discouraging our Commerce
lessening our Revenue, or starving our Poor.</P>
<P>But there are Vices in Trade, which I
wou'd direct the Complete Tradesmen to
avoid, and which tend indeed to destroy
our Trade, to wound it in the most tender
parts, and to expose it, in the End, to a
total Decay, if not to Death and Destruc∣tion;
I mean as to its prosperous and flou∣rishing
Circumstances. It is true, while there
are People, while we are a populous, a nu∣merous
Nation, we must have Trade, Peo∣ple
make Trade of mere necessity, and for
mere necessity Men must have Food and
Clothes, and that alone will continue some
Trade; but this will not support the de∣gree
of Trade which must be maintain'd,
<PB N="175" REF="489"/>
to make our Trade be what we call great
and flourishing.</P>
<P>Nor indeed will the Home-Trade of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI>
in a few more Years, be like what it
now is, if we do not enter into some new
Measures for its support; and this is what
I wou'd move the Complete <HI>English</HI> Trades∣men
to consider.</P>
<P>The first and main thing is this, that
while we are call'd Home Traders, we shou'd
not be promoters of Foreign Trade in pre∣judice
of our own.</P>
<P>It has been of great weight in my Direc∣tions
to the Complete Tradesmen, in order
to persuade him to go on successfully,
that he shou'd not be above his Business,
that he shou'd not be asham'd of his Shop
or of his Counter, that he shou'd be dili∣gent
in all his Affairs, that he shou'd add Ap∣plication
and Industry, in his Business, to
Knowledge and Experience of his Business.</P>
<P>But let me add, if our Manufactures are
the Tradesmens Life, if they are his Trade,
why shou'd they not be his Wear? why
should the Merchant be above his own Ma∣nufactures?
'tis an absurdity in Trade; and
however frequent it be, it cannot be pleaded
for; that whereas the Consumption of the
Manufacture is the Life and Soul of the Ma∣nufacturers,
and of the Tradesmen that deal
in it, those Manufacturers and Tradesmen
shou'd with-hold their Hands from that Con∣sumption,
<PB N="176" REF="490"/>
and be above wearing the Manu∣factures
they get their Bread by.</P>
<P>It is an unhappy humour, which at pre∣sent,
I may say, runs in the Blood of this
whole Nation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that while we see al∣most
all the Nations, in <HI>Europe</HI> labouring
to discourage our Manufacture, and to wear
their own, however inferior in goodness<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
while we see them Diligent to promo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>
their own Growth, and employ their own
Poor, and rather to content themselves with
worse and meaner things, I mean as t<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Cloathing, than they wou'd otherwise make
use of, that they may encourage and employ
their own People; we see our own Nation
at the same time pleas'd with any Foreign
Manufacture, rather than their own, and
choosing to dress in the tawdry and sorry
trifles of Strangers, rather than in the much
more valuable Articles of their own Work∣manship;
as if they were Sick and Surfeit∣ed
with their own Manufactures, and will∣ing
to see their own People starve, rather
than encourage them by wearing the very
Goods they Sell.</P>
<P>I have only room to add, that while we
practise this, we ought never more to com∣plain
of the Decay of our Trade.</P>
