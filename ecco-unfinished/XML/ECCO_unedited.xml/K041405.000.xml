<L>CHILL'D by rude gales, while yet reluctant May</L>
<L>Withholds the beauties of the vernal day;</L>
<L>As fome fond maid, whom matron frowns reprove,</L>
<L>Suspends the smile her heart devotes to love;</L>
<L>The season's pleasures too delay their hour,</L>
<L>And winter revels with protracted power;</L>
<L>Then blame not, Critics, if, thus late, we bring</L>
<L>A winter Drama—but reproach—the spring.</L>
<L>What prudent Cit dares yet the season trust,</L>
<L>Bask in his whisky, and enjoy the dust?</L>
<L>Hors'd in Cheapside, scarce yet the gayer spark</L>
<L>Achieves the Sunday triumph of the Park;</L>
<L>Scarce yet you see him, dreading to the late,</L>
<L>Scour the New Road, and dash thro' Grosvenor-gate:—</L>
<L>Anxious—yet timorous too!—his steed to show,</L>
<L>The hack Bucephalus of Rotten-row.</L>
<L>Careless he seems, yet, vigilantly sly,</L>
<L>Wooes the stray glance of Ladies passing by,</L>
<L>While his off heel insidiously aside,</L>
<L>Provokes the caper which he seems to chide.</L>
<L>Scarce rural Kensington due honour gains;</L>
<L>The vulgar verdure of her walk remains!</L>
<L>Where white-rob'd misses-amble two by two,</L>
<L>Nodding to booted beaux—“How'do, how'do?”</L>
<L>With gen'rous questions that no answer wait,</L>
<L>“How vastly full! A'n't you come vastly late?</L>
<L>I'n't it quite charming? When do you leave town?</L>
<L>A'n't you quite tir'd? Pray can we set you down?”</L>
<L>These suburb pleasures of a London May,</L>
<L>Imperfect yet, we hail the cold delay;</L>
<L>Should our Play please—and you're indulgent ever—</L>
<L>Be your decree—“'Tis better late than never.”</L>

<L>ERE yet Suspense has still'd its throbbing fear,</L>
<L>Or melancholy wip'd the grateful tear,</L>
<L>While e'en the miseries of a sinking State,</L>
<L>A Monarch's danger, and a Nation's fate,</L>
<L>Command not now your eyes with grief to flow,</L>
<L>Lost in a trembling Mother's nearer woe;</L>
<L>What moral lay shall Poetry rehearse,</L>
<L>Or how shall Elocution pour the verse</L>
<L>So sweetly, that its music shall repay</L>
<L>The lov'd illusion, which it drives away?</L>
<L>Mine is the task, to rigid custom due,</L>
<L>To me ungrateful, as 'tis harsh to you,</L>
<L>To mar the work the tragic scene has wrought,</L>
<L>To rouse the mind that broods in pensive thought,</L>
<L>To scare Reflection, which, in absent dreams,</L>
<L>Still lingers-musing on the recent themes;</L>
<L>Attention, ere with contemplation tir'd,</L>
<L>To turn from all that pleas'd, from all that fir'd;</L>
<L>To weaken lessons strongly now imprest,</L>
<L>And chill the interest glowing in the breast—</L>
<L>Mine is the task; and be it mine to spare</L>
<L>The souls that pant, the griefs they see, to share;</L>
<L>Let me with no unhallow'd jest deride</L>
<L>The sigh, that sweet Compassion owns with pride—</L>
<L>The sigh of Comfort to Affliction dear,</L>
<L>That Kindness heaves, and Virtue loves to hear.</L>
<L>E'en gay THALIA will not now refuse</L>
<L>This-gentle homage to her Sister-Muse.</L>
<L>O ye, who listen to the plaintive strain,</L>
<L>With strange enjoyment, and with rapturous pain,</L>
<L>Who erst have felt the <HI>Stranger</HI>'s lone despair,</L>
<L>And <HI>Haller</HI>'s settled, sad, remorseful care,</L>
<L>Does <HI>Rolla</HI>'s pure affection less excite</L>
<L><PB REF="6"/>
The inexpressive anguish of delight?</L>
<L>Do <HI>Cora</HI>'s fears, which beat without control,</L>
<L>With less solicitude engross the soul?</L>
<L>Ah, no! your minds with kindred zeal approve</L>
<L>Maternal feeling, and heroic love.</L>
<L>You must approve; where man exists below,</L>
<L>In temperate climes, or midst drear wastes of snow,</L>
<L>Or where the solar fires incessant flame,</L>
<L>Thy laws, all-powerful Nature, are the same:</L>
<L>Vainly the Sophist boasts, he can explain</L>
<L>The causes of thy universal reign—</L>
<L>More vainly would his cold presumptuous art</L>
<L>Disprove thy general empire o'er the heart:</L>
<L>A voice proclaims thee, that we must believe,</L>
<L>A voice that surely speaks not to deceive;</L>
<L>That voice poor <HI>Cora</HI> heard, and closely prest</L>
<L>Her darling infant to her fearful breast;</L>
<L>Distracted dar'd the bloody field to tread,</L>
<L>And sought <HI>Alonzo</HI> through the heaps of dead,</L>
<L>Eager to catch the music of his breath,</L>
<L>Though faltering in the agonies of death,</L>
<L>To touch his lips, though pale and cold, once more,</L>
<L>And clasp his bosom, though it stream'd with gore;</L>
<L>That voice too <HI>Rolla</HI> heard, and, greatly brave,</L>
<L>His <HI>Cora</HI>'s dearest treasure died to save,</L>
<L>Gave to the hopeless Parent's arms her child,</L>
<L>Beheld her transports, and expiring smil'd.</L>
<L>That voice ye hear—Oh! be its will obey'd!</L>
<L>'Tis Valour's impulse and 'tis Virtue's aid—</L>
<L>It prompts to all Benevolence admires,</L>
<L>To all that heav'nly Piety inspires,</L>
<L>To all that Praise repeats through lengthen'd years,</L>
<L>That Honour sanctifies, and Time reveres.</L>

<STAGE>A magnificent Pavillion near <HI>PIZZARO'S</HI> Tent—a
View of the Spanish Camp in the back Ground.—<HI>ELVIRA</HI>
is discovered sleeping under a canopy on
one side of the Pavillion.—<HI>VALVERDE</HI> enters,
gazes on <HI>ELVIRA,</HI> kneels, and attempts to kiss
her hand; <HI>ELVIRA,</HI> awakened, rises and looks
at him with indignation.</STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>AUDACIOUS! Whence is thy privi∣lege
to interrupt the few moments of repose
my harassed mind can snatch amid the tumults
of this noisy camp? Shall I inform your mas∣ter
of this presumptuous treachery? shall I dis∣close
thee to Pizarro? Hey!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am his servant, it is true—trusted by
him—and I know him well; and therefore 'tis
I ask, by what magic could Pizarro gain your
heart, by what fatality still holds he your affec∣tion?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="9"/>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold! thou trusty SECRETARY!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ignobly born! in mind and manners
rude, ferocious, and unpolished, though cool and
crafty if occasion need—in youth audacious—ill
his first manhood—a licensed pirate—treating
men as brutes, the world as booty; yet now the
Spanish hero is he styled—the first of Spanish
conquerors! and for a warrior so accomplished,
'tis fit Elvira should leave her noble family, her
fame, her home, to share the dangers, humours,
and the crimes of such a lover as Pizarro!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>What! Valverde moralizing! But grant
I am in error, what is my incentive? Passion,
infatuation, call it as you will; but what attaches
<HI>thee</HI> to this despised, unworthy leader?—Base
lucre is thy object, mean fraud thy means. Could
you gain me, you only hope to win a higher in∣terest
in Pizarro—I know you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>On my soul, you wrong me; what else
my faults, I have none towards you: but indulge
the scorn and levity of your nature; do it while
yet the time permits; the gloomy hour, I fear,
too soon approaches.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Valverde a prophet too!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Elvira—Shame from his late
defeat, and burning wishes for revenge, again
have brought Pizarra to Peru; but trust me, he
over-rates his strength, nor measures well the
foe. Encamped in a strange country, where ter∣ror
cannot force, nor corruption buy a single
friend, what have we to hope? The army mur∣muring
at increasing hardships, while Pizarro
decorates with gaudy spoil the gay pavillion of
his luxury! each day diminishes our force.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you not the heirs of those that
fall?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="10"/>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Are gain and plunder then our only pur∣pose?
Is this Elvira's heroism?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, so save me Heaven! I abhor the
motive, means, and end of your pursuits; but
I will trust none of you:—in your whole army
there is not one of you that has a heart, or speaks
ingenuously—aged Las-Casus, and he alone, ex∣cepted.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>He! an enthusiast in the opposite and
worse extreme!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! had I earlier known that virtuous
man, how different might my lot have been!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>I will grant, Pizarro could not then so
easily have duped you; forgive me, but at that
event I still must wonder.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hear me, Valverde.—When first my
virgin fancy waked to love, Pizarro was my
country's idol. Self-taught, self-raised, and self∣supported,
he became a hero; and I was formed
to be won by glory and renown. 'Tis known
that when he left Panama in a slight vessel, his
force was not an hundred men. Arrived in the
island of Gallo; with his sword he drew a line
upon the sands, and said, “Pass those who
to die or conquer with their leader.” Thirteen
alone remained, and at the head of these the
warrior stood his ground. Even at the moment
when my ears first caught this tale, my heart
exclaimed, “Pizarro is its lord!” What since I
have perceived, or thought, or felt! you must
have more worth to win the knowledge of.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>I press no further; still assured that while
Alonzo de Molina, our General's former friend
and pupil, leads the enemy, Pizarro never more
will be a conqueror.</P>
<STAGE>(Trumpets without.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Silence! I hear him coming; look not
<PB N="4" REF="11"/>
perplexed.—How mystery and fraud confound
the countenance! Quick, put on an honest face,
if thou canst.</P>
<P><HI>Pizarro (Speaking without.</HI>) Chain and secure
him; I will examine him myself.</P>
</SP>
<STAGE>PIZARRO <HI>enters.</HI></STAGE>
<STAGE>(Valverde <HI>bows</HI>—Elvira <HI>laughs.</HI></STAGE>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why dost thou smile, Elvira?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elz.</SPEAKER>
<P>To laugh or weep without a reason, is
one of the few privileges we women have.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elvira, I will know the cause, I am re∣solved!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad of that, because I love reso∣lution,
and am resolved not to tell you. Now
my resolution, I take it, is the better of the two,
because it depends upon myself, and yours does
not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Psha! trifler!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Elvira was laughing at my apprehensions
that—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Apprehensions!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes—that Alonzo's skill and genius
should so have disciplined and informed the
enemy, as to—</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alonzo! the traitor! How I once loved
that man! His noble mother entrusted him, a
boy, to my protection. At my table did he
feast—in my tent did he repose. I had marked
his early genius, and the valorous spirit that
grew with it. Often I had talked to him of our
first adventures—what storms we struggled with
—what perils we surmounted. When landed
with a slender host upon an unknown land—
<PB N="5" REF="12"/>
then, when I told how famine and fatigue, dis∣cord
and toil, day by day, did thin our ranks;
amid close-pressing enemies, how still undaunted
I endured and dared—maintained my purpose
and my power in despite of growling mutiny or
bold revolt, till with my faithful few remaining I
became at last victorious!—When, I say, of these
things I spoke, the youth, Alonzo, with tears of
wonder and delight, would throw him on my
neck, and swear, his soul's ambition owned no
other leader.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>What could subdue attachment so be∣gun?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Las Casas—he it was, with fascinating
craft and canting precepts of humanity, raised
in Alonzo's mind a new enthusiasm, which forced
him, as the stripling termed it, to forego his
country's claims for those of human nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, the traitor left you, joined the Pe∣ruvians,
and became thy enemy and Spain's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>But first with weariless remonstrance he
sued to win me from my purpose, and untwine
the sword from my determined grasp. Much he
spoke of right, of justice and humanity, calling
the Peruvians our innocent and unoffending
brethren.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>They!—Obdurate heathens!—They our
brethren!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when we found that the soft folly of
the pleading tears he dropt upon my bosom fell
on marble, he flew and joined the foe: then,
prositing by the lessons he had gain'd in wrong'd
Pizarro's school, the youth so disciplined and led
his new allies, that soon he forced me—Ha! I
burn with shame and fury while I own it in
<PB N="6" REF="13"/>
base retreat and foul discomfiture to quit the
shore.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>But the hour of revenge is come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is; I am returned—my force is strength∣ened,
and the audacious Boy shall soon know
that Pizarro lives, and has—a grateful recollecti∣on
of the thanks he owes him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Val.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis doubted whether still Alonzo lives.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis certain that he does; one of his ar∣mour-bearers
is just made prisoner; twelve thou∣sand
is their force, as he reports, led by Alonzo
and Peruvian Rolla. This day they make a so∣lemn
sacrifice on their ungodly altars. We must
profit by their security, and attack them unpre∣pared—the
sacrificers shall become the victims.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<STAGE>(Aside.)</STAGE>
<P>Wretched innocents! And their
own blood shall bedew their altars!</P>

<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why should I retire?</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Piz.</SPEAKER>
<P>Because men are to meet here, and on
manly business.</P>

<SP>

<P>O, men! men! ungrateful and per∣verse!
O, woman! still affectionate though
wrong'd! The Beings to whose eyes you turn
for animation, hope, and rapture, through the
days of mirth and revelry; and on whose bosoms
in the hour of sore calamity you seek for rest and
consolation; THEM, when the pompous follies of
your mean ambition are the question, you treat
as playthings or as slaves!—I shall not retire.</P>

<P>Remain then—and, if thou canst, be

tiger, chased by the hunter's spear; in peace as
gentle as the unweaned lamb. CORA was once
betrothed to him; but finding she preferred
Alonzo, he resigned his claim, and, I fear, his
peace, to friendship and to CORAS'S happiness;

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rol.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet never was the hour of peril near,
when to inspire them words were so little need∣ed.
My brave associates—partners of my toil,
my feelings and my fame!—can Rolla's words
add vigour to the virtuous energies which inspire
your hearts?—No—YOU have judged as I
have, the foulness of the crafty plea by which
these bold invaders would delude you—Your
generous spirit has compared as mine has, the
motives, which, in a war like this, can animate
<HI>their</HI> minds, and OURS.—THEY, by a strange
frenzy driven, fight for power, for plunder,
and extended rule—WE, for our country, our
altars, and our homes.—THEY follow an Ad∣venturer
whom they fear—and obey a power
which they hate—WE serve a Monarch whom
we love—a God whom we adore.—Whene'er
they move in anger, desolation tracks their pro∣gress!
—Where'er they pause in amity, afflic∣tion
mourns their friendship!—They boast, they
come but to improve our state, enlarge our
thoughts, and free us from the yoke of error!
YES—THEY will give enlightened freedom to
<HI>our</HI> minds, who are themselves the slaves of pas∣sion,
avarice and pride.—They offer us their
protection—Yes, such protection as vultures
give to lambs—covering and devouring them!
—They call on us to barter all of good we have
inherited and proved, for the desperate change
of something better which they promise.—Be
<PB N="23" REF="30"/>
our plain answer this: The throne WE honour is
the PEOPLE'S CHOICE—the laws we reverence are
our brave Father's legacy—the faith we follow
teaches us to live in bonds of charity with all
mankind, and die with hope of bliss beyond the
grave. Tell your invaders this, and tell them
too, we seek no change; and, least of all, such
change as they would bring us.</P>

Next I should tell how hurtful customs, and su∣perstitions
strange and sullen, would often scatter

where now, in clustered villages, they live like
brethren, social and confiding, while through

the thrilling records of his praise; my lips to

my brain to turn giddy with delight,
reading the applauding tributes of his monarch's

throb with transport, while I heard the shouts of
acclamation which announced the coming of my
hero; my whole soul to love him with devotion!
with enthusiasm! to see no other object—to own
no other tie—but to make HIM my WORLD!
Thus to love is at least no common weakness.

<P>And should posterity applaud my deeds,

<SPEAKER>Elv.</SPEAKER>
<P>Each word thou speakest—each moment

to feel what genuine fame and glory are—yes,
prefer the flattery of thy own fleeting day to the
<PB N="46" REF="53"/>
bright circle of a deathless name—yes, prefer
to stare upon the grain of sand on which you
trample, to musing on the starred canopy above
thee. Fame, the sovereign deity of proud am∣bition,
is not to be worshipped so: who seeks
alone for living homage, stands a mean canvasser
in her temple's porch, wooing promiscuously
from the fickle breath of every wretch that passes,
the brittle tribute of his praise. He dares not
approach the sacred altar—no noble sacrifice of
his is placed there, nor ever shall his worship'd

<P>Pizarro, if not to honour, if not to hu∣manity,

of the sacrifices I have made for thy sake.
Have I not for thee quitted my parents, my
friends, my fame, my native land? When
escaping, did I not risque in rushing to thy arms
to bury myself in the bosom of the deep? Have
I not shared all thy perils, heavy storms at sea,
and frightful 'scapes on shore? Even on this

dreadful day, amid the route of battle, who re∣mained
firm and constant at Pizarro's side? Who
presented her bosom as his shield to the assailing
foe?</P>

lips which, cold and jeering, barbing revenge
with rancorous mockery, can insult a fallen ene∣my,
shall never more receive the pledge of love:
the arm unshaken by its bloody purpose, which
shall assign to needless torture the victim who
avows his heart, never more shall press the hand
