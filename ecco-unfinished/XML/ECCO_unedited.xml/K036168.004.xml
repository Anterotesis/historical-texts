<HEAD>SECTION I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the GENERAL PRINCIPLES of MORALS.</HEAD>
<P>DISPUTES with persons, pertinaciously ob∣stinate
in their principles, are, of all others,
the most irksome; except, perhaps, those
with persons, intirely disingenuous, who really do not
believe the opinion they defend, but engage in the
controversy, from affectation, from a spirit of oppo∣sition,
or from a desire of showing wit and ingenuity,
superior to the rest of mankind. The same blind ad∣herence
to their own arguments is to be expected in
both; the same contempt of their antagonists; and
the same passionate vehemence, in inforcing sophistry
and falshood. And as reasoning is not the source,
whence either disputant derives his tenets; tis in vain
to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the af∣fections,
will ever engage him to embrace <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounder
principles.</P>
<P>THOSE who have denied the reality of moral dis∣tinctions,
may be ranked among the disingenuous dis∣putants;
<PB N="4" REF="8"/>
nor is it conceivable, that any human crea∣ture
could ever seriously believe, that all characters
and actions were alike intitled to the affection and re∣gard
of every one. The difference, which nature has
placed between one man and another, is so wide, and
this difference is still so much farther widened, by edu∣cation,
example, and habit, that where the opposite
extremes come at once under our apprehension, there
is no scepticism so scrupulous, and scarce any assurance
so determined, as absolutely to deny all distinction be∣tween
them. Let a man's insensibility be ever so
great, he must often be touched with the images of
RIGHT and WRONG; and let his prejudices
be ever so obstinate, he must observe, that others are
susceptible of like impressions. The only way, there∣fore,
of converting an antagonist of this kind, is to
leave him to himself. For, finding that no body
keeps up the controversy with him, 'tis probable he
will, at last, of himself, from mere weariness, come
over to the side of common sense and reason.</P>
<P>THERE has been a controversy started of late,
much better worth examination, concerning the ge∣neral
foundation of MORALS; whether they are
derived from REASON, or from SENTI∣MENT;
whether we attain the knowlege of them
by a chain of argument and induction, or by an im∣mediate
feeling and finer internal sense; whether,
like all sound judgment of truth and falshood, they
<PB N="5" REF="9"/>
should be the same to every rational intelligent being;
or whether, like the perception of beauty and desor∣mity,
they are founded intirely on the particular fa∣bric
and constitution of the human species.</P>
<P>THE antient philosophers, tho' they often affirm,
that virtue is nothing but conformity to reason, yet, in
general, seem to consider morals as deriving their ex∣istence
from taste and sentiment. On the other hand,
our modern inquirers, tho' they also talk much of the
beauty of virtue, and deformity of vice, yet have
commonly endeavoured to account for these distinc∣tions
by metaphysical reasonings, and by deductions
from the most abstract principles of human under∣standing.
Such confusion reigned in these subjects,
that an opposition of the greatest consequence could
prevail between one system and another, and even
in the parts almost of each individual system; and yet
no body, till very lately, was ever sensible of it. The
elegant Lord SHAFTESBURY, who first gave occasion
to remark this distinction, and who, in general, adhe∣red
to the principles of the antients, is not▪ himself,
intirely free from the same confusion.</P>
<P>IT must be acknowleged, that both sides of the
question are susceptible of specious arguments. Moral
distinctions, it may be said, are discernible by pure
<HI>reason:</HI> Elfe, whence the many disputes that reign in
common life, as well as in philosophy, with regard to
<PB N="6" REF="10"/>
this subject: The long chain of proofs often produced
on both sides; the examples cited, the authorities ap∣pealed
to, the analogies employed, the fallacies detect∣ed,
the inferences drawn, and the several conclusions
adjusted to their proper principles. Truth is dispu∣table;
not, taste: What exists in the nature of things
is the standard of our judgment; what each man
feels within himself is the standard of sentiment. Pro∣positions
in geometry may be proved, systems in phy∣sics
may be controverted; but the harmony of verse,
the tenderness of passion, the brilliancy of wit, must
give immediate pleasure. No man reasons concern∣ing
another's beauty; but frequently concerning the
justice or injustice of his actions. In every trial the
first object of the criminals is to disprove the facts al∣leged,
and deny the actions imputed to them: The
second to prove, that even if these actions were real,
they might be justified, as innocent and lawful. 'Tis
confessedly by deductions of the understanding, that
the first point is ascertained: How can we suppose,
that a different faculty of the mind is employed in fix∣ing
the other?</P>
<P>ON the other hand, those who would resolve all
moral determinations into <HI>sentiment,</HI> may endeavour to
snow, that 'tis impossible for reason ever to draw con∣clusions
of this nature. To virtue, say they, it be∣longs
to be <HI>amiable,</HI> and vice <HI>odious.</HI> This forms their
very nature or essence. But can reason or argumenta∣tion
<PB N="7" REF="11"/>
distribute these different epithets to any subjects,
and pronounce beforehand, that this must produce
love, and that hatred? Or what other reason can we
ever assign for these affections, but the original fabric
and formation of the human mind, which is naturally
adapted to receive them?</P>
<P>THE end of all moral speculations is to teach us
our duty: and, by proper representations of the de∣formity
of vice and beauty of virtue, beget correspon∣dent
habits, and engage us to avoid the one, and em∣brace
the other. But is this ever to be expected from
inferences and conclusions of the understanding, which
of themselves have no hold of the affections, nor set in
motion the active powers of men? They discover
truths: but where the truths which they discover are
indifferent, and beget no desire or aversion, they can
have no influence on conduct and behaviour. What
is honourable, what is fair, what is becoming, what is
noble, what is generous, takes possession of the heart,
and animates us to embrace and maintain it. What is
intelligible, what is evident, what is probable, what is
true, procures only the cool assent of the understand∣ing;
and gratifying a speculative curiosity puts an end
to our researches.</P>
<P>EXTINGUISH all the warm feelings and preposses∣sions
in favour of virtue, and all disgust or aversion
against vice: Render men totally indifferent towards
<PB N="8" REF="12"/>
these distinctions; and morality is no longer a prac∣tical
study, nor has any tendency to regulate our lives
and actions.</P>
<P>THESE arguments on each side (and many more
might be produced) are so plausible, that I am apt to
suspect, they may, the one as well as the other, be so∣lid
and satisfactory, and that <HI>reason</HI> and <HI>sentiment</HI> con∣cur
in almost all moral determinations and conclusions.
The final sentence, 'tis probable, which pronounces
characters and actions amiable or odious, praise-worthy
or blameable; that which stamps on them the mark
of honour or infamy, approbation or censure; that
which renders morality an active principle, and consti∣tutes
virtue our happiness, and vice our misery:
'Tis probable, I say, that this final sentence depends
on some internal sense or feeling, which nature has
made universal in the whole species. For what else
can have an influence of this nature? But in order to
pave the way for such a sentiment, and give a proper
discernment of its object, 'tis often necessary, we find,
that much reasoning should precede, that nice distinc∣tions
be made, just conclusions drawn, distant compa∣risons
formed, complicated relations examined, and
general facts fixed and ascertained. Some species of
beauty, especially the natural kinds, on their first ap∣pearance,
command our affection and approbation;
and where they fail of this effect, 'tis impossible for
any reasoning to redress their influence, or adapt them
<PB N="9" REF="13"/>
better to our taste sentiment. But in many orders
of beauty, particularly those of the finer arts, 'tis re∣quisite
to employ much reasoning, in order to feel the
proper sentiment; and a false relish may frequently
be corrected by argument and reflection. There are
just grounds to conclude, that moral beauty partakes
much of this latter species, and demands the assistance
of our intellectual faculties, in order to give it a suit∣able
influence on the human mind.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this question, concerning the general
principles of morals, be extremely curious and import∣ant,
'tis needless for us, at present, to employ farther
care in our researches concerning it. For if we can
be so happy, in the course of this inquiry, as to disco∣ver
the true origin of morals, it will then easily appear
how far sentiment or reason enter into all determina∣tions
of this nature<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix first.</NOTE>. Mean while, it will scarce be
possible for us, ere this controversy is fully decided, to
proceed in that accurate manner, required in the sci∣ences;
by beginning with exact definitions, of VIR∣TUE
and VICE, which are the objects of our pre∣sent
inquiry. But we shall do what may justly be
esteemed as satisfactory. We shall consider the mat∣ter
as an object of experience. We shall call <HI>every
quality or action of the mind,</HI> virtuous, <HI>which is attend∣ed
with the approbation of the spectator:</HI> And we shall
denominate vicious, <HI>every quality, which is the object
<PB N="10" REF="14"/>
of bis blame or censure.</HI> These qualities we shall en∣deavour
to collect; and after examining, on both
sides, the several circumstances, in which they agree,
'<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is hoped we may, at last, reach the foundation of
ethics, and find those univerfal principles, from which
all moral censure or approbation is ultimately derived.
As this is a question of fact, not of abstract science,
we can only expect success, by following the experi∣mental
method, and deducing general maxims from a
comparison of particular instances. The other scien∣tifical
method, where a general abstract principle is
first established, and is afterwards branched out into a
variety of inferences and conclusions, may be more
perfect in itself, but suits less the imperfection of hu∣man
nature, and is a common source of illusion and
mistake in this as well as in other subjects. Men are
now cured of their passion for hypotheses and systems
in natural philosophy, and will hearken to no argu∣ments
but those derived from experience. 'Tis full
time that they should begin a like reformation in all
moral disquisitions; and reject every system of ethics,
however subtile or ingenious, which is not founded
on fact and observation.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of BENEVOLENCE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a principle, supposed to prevail among
many, which is utterly incompatible with all
virtue or moral sentiment; and as it can proceed from
nothing but the most depraved disposition; so in its
turn it tends still farther to encourage that depravity.
This principle is, that all <HI>benevolence</HI> is mere hypo∣crisy,
friendship a cheat, public spirit a farce, fidelity
a snare to procure trust and confidence; and while all
of us, at the bottom, pursue only our private in∣terest,
we wear these fair disguises, in order to put
others off their guard, and expose them the more
to our wiles and machinations. What heart one
must be possessed of who professes such principles, and
who feels no internal sentiment that belies so perni∣cious
a theory, 'tis easy to imagine: And also, what
degree of affection and benevolence he can bear to a
species, whom he represents under such odious co∣lours,
<PB N="12" REF="16"/>
and supposes so little susceptible of gratitude or
any return of affection. Or if we will not ascribe
these principles wholly to a corrupted heart, we must,
at least account for them from the most careless and
precipitant examination. Supersicial reasoners, in∣deed,
observing many false pretences among man∣kind,
and feeling, perhaps, no very strong restraint
in their own disposition, might draw a general and a
hasty conclusion, that all is equally corrupted, and
that men, different from all other animals, and indeed
from all other species of existence, admit of no de∣grees
of good or bad, but are, in every instance, the
same creatures, under different disguises and appear∣ances.</P>
<P>THERE is another principle, somewhat resembling
the former; which has been much insisted on by phi∣losophers,
and has been the foundation of many a
system; that whatever affection one may feel, or ima∣gine
he feels for others, no passion is, or can be disin∣terested;
that the most generous friendship, however
sincere, is a modification of self-love; and that, even
unknown to ourselves, we seek only our own gratifi∣cation,
while we appear the most deeply engaged in
schemes for the liberty and happiness of mankind.
By a turn of imagination, by a refinement of reflection,
by an enthusiasm of passion, we feem to take part in
the interests of others, and imagine ourselves divested
of all selfish considerations: But, at bottom, the most
<PB N="13" REF="17"/>
generous patriot and most niggardly miser, the bravest
hero and most abject coward, have, in every action,
an equal regard to their own happiness and welfare.</P>
<P>WHOEVER concludes, from the seeming tendency
of this opinion, that those, who make profession of it,
cannot possibly feel the true sentiments of benevolence,
or have any regard for genuine virtue, will often find
himself, in practice, very much mistaken. Probity
and honour were no strangers to EPICURUS and his
sect. ATTICUS and HORACE seem to have enjoyed
from nature, and cultivated by reflection, as gene∣rous
and friendly dispositions as any disciple of the au∣sterer
schools. And among the moderns, HOBBES
and LOCKE, who maintained the selfish system of mo∣rals,
lived most irreproachable lives; tho' the former
lay not under any restraint of religion, which might
supply the defects of his philosophy.</P>
<P>AN EPICUREAN or a HOBBIST readily allows, that
there is such a thing as friendship is the world, with∣out
hypocrisy or disguise; tho' he may attempt, by a
philosophical chymistry, to resolve the elements of
this passion, if I may so speak, into those of another,
and explain every affection to be self-love, twisted and
moulded into a variety of appearances. But as the
same turn of imagination prevails not in every man,
nor gives the same direction to the original passion;
this is sufficient, even according to the selfish system,
<PB N="14" REF="18"/>
to make the widest difference in human characters, and
denominate one man virtuous and humane, another
vicious and meanly interested. I esteem the man,
whose self love, by whatever means, is so directed as
to give him a concern for others, and render him ser∣viceable
to society: As I hate or despise him, who has
no regard to any thing beyond his own gratifications
and enjoyments. In vain would you suggest, that
these characters, tho' seemingly opposite, are, at bot∣tom,
the same, and that a very inconsiderable turn of
imagination forms the whole difference between them.
Each character, notwithstanding these inconsiderable
differences, appears to me, in practice, pretty durable
and untransmutable. And I find not in this, more than
in other subjects, that the natural sentiments, arising
from the general appearances of things, are easily de∣stroyed
by subtile reflections concerning the minute
origin of these appearances. Does not the lively,
chearful colour of a countenance inspire me with com∣placency
and pleasure; even tho' I learn from philo∣sophy,
that all difference of complexion arises from
the most minute differences of thickness, in the most
minute parts of the skin; by means of which a super∣ficies
is qualified to reflect one of the original colours
of light, and absorb the others?</P>
<P>BUT tho' the question, concerning the universal or
partial selfishness of man, be not so material, as is usu∣ally
imagined, to morality and practice, it is certain∣ly
<PB N="15" REF="19"/>
of consequence in the speculative science of human
nature, and is a proper object of curiosity and inquiry.
It may not, therefore, be improper, in this place, to
beflow a few reflections upon it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Benevolence naturally divides into two kinds, the <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular.</HI> The first is, where we have no friendship or connexion or esteem for the person, but feel only a general sym∣pathy with him or a compassion for his pains, and a congratu∣lation with his pleasures. The other species of benevolence is founded on an opinion of virtue, on services done us, or on some particular connexions. Both these sentiments must be al∣lowed real in human nature; but whether they will resolve into some nice considerations of self-love, is a question more curious than important. The former sentiment, <HI>viz.</HI> that of general benevolence, or humanity, or sympathy, we shall have occasion frequently to treat of in the course of this inquiry; and I assume it as real, from general experience, without any other proof.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE most obvious objection to the selfish hypothe∣fis,
is, that as it is contrary to common feeling and
our most unprejudiced notions; there is required the
highest stretch of philosophy to establish so extraor∣dinary
a paradox. To the most careless observer,
there appear to be such dispositions as benevolence
and generosity; such affections as love, friendship,
compassion, gratitude. These sentiments have their
causes, effects, objects, and operations, marked by
common language and observation, and plainly dis∣tinguished
from those of the selfish passions. And as
<PB N="16" REF="20"/>
this is the obvious appearance of things, it must be
admitted; till some hypothesis be discovered, which,
by penetrating deeper into human nature, may prove
the former affections to be nothing but modifications
of the latter. All attempts of this kind have hitherto
proved fruitless, and seem to have proceeded intirely
from that love of <HI>simplicity,</HI> which has been the source
of much false reasoning in philosophy. I shall not
here enter into any detail on the present subject. Many
able philosophers have shown the insufficiency of these
systems. And I shall take for granted what, I believe,
the smallest reflection will make evident to every im∣partial
inquirer.</P>
<P>BUT the nature of the subject furnishes the strong∣est
presumption, that no better system will ever, for
the future, be invented, in order to account for the
origin of the benevolent from the selfish affections,
and reduce all the various emotions of the human
mind to a perfect simplicity. The case is not the same
in this species of philosophy as in physics. Many an
hypothesis in nature, contrary to first appearances, has
been found, on more accurate scrutiny, solid and satis∣factory.
Instances of this kind are so frequent, that a
judicious, as well as witty philosopher<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mons FONTENELLE.</NOTE>, has ventured
to affirm, if there be more than one way, in which
any phaenomenon may be produced, that there is a
<PB N="17" REF="21"/>
general presumption for its arising from the causes
which are the least obvious and familiar. But the
presumption always lies on the other fide, in all in∣quiries
concerning the origin of our passions, and of
the internal operations of the human mind. The
simplest and most obvious cause, which can there be
assigned for any phaenomenon, is probably the true
one. When a philosopher, in the explication of his
system, is obliged to have recourse to some very in
tricate and refined reflections, and to suppose them es∣sential
to the production of any passion or emotion,
we have reason to be extremely on our guard against
so fallacious an hypothesis. The affections are not
susceptible of any impression from the refinements of
reason or imagination; and 'tis always found, that a
vigorous exertion of the latter faculties, necessarily,
from the narrow capacity of the human mind, de∣stroys
all activity in the former. Our predominant
motive or intention is, indeed, frequently concealed
from ourselves, when it is mingled and confounded
with other motives which the mind, from vanity or
self-conceit, is desirous of suppofing more prevalent:
But there is no instance, that a concealment of this
nature has ever arisen from the abstruseness and intri∣cacy
of the motive. A man, who has lost a friend and
patron, may flatter himself, that all his grief arises
from generous sentiments, without any mixture of
narrow or interested considerations: But a man, who
grieves for a valuable friend, who needed his patron∣age
<PB N="18" REF="22"/>
and protection; how can we suppose, that his
passionate tenderness arises from some metaphysical re∣gards
to a self-interest, which has no foundation or
reality? We may as well imagine, that minute wheels
and springs, like those of a watch, give motion to a
loaded waggon, as account for the origin of passion
from such abstruse reflections.</P>
<P>ANIMALS are found susceptible of kindness, both
to their own species and to ours; nor is there, in this
cafe, the least suspicion of disguise or artifice. Shall
we account for all <HI>their</HI> sentiments too, from refined
deductions of self interest? Or if we admit a disinte∣rested
benevolence in the inferior species, by what rule
of analogy can we refuse it in the superior?</P>
<P>LOVE between the sexes begets a complacency and
good-will, very distinct from the gratification of an
appetite. Tenderness to their offspring, in all sensible
beings, is commonly able alone to counterbalance the
strongest motives of self-love, and has no manner of
dependance on that affection. What interest can a
fond mother have in view, who loses her health by as∣siduous
attendance on her sick child, and afterwards
languishes and dies of grief, when freed, by its death,
from the slavery of that attendance?</P>
<P>Is gratitude no affection of the human breast, or is
that a word merely without any meaning or reality?
<PB N="19" REF="23"/>
Have we no satisfaction in one man's company above
another's, and no desire of the welfare of our friend,
even tho' absence or death should prevent us from all
participation in it? Or what is it commonly, that
gives us any participation in it, even while alive and
present, but our affection and regard to him?</P>
<P>THESE and a thousand other instances are marks of
a general benevolence in human nature, where no <HI>real</HI>
interest binds us to the object. And how an <HI>imagi∣nary</HI>
interest, known and avowed for such, can be the
origin of any passion or emotion, seems difficult to ex∣plain.
No satisfactory hypothesis of this kind has yet
been discovered; nor is there the smallest probability,
that the future industry of men will ever be attended
with more favourable success.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if we consider rightly of the matter,
we shall find, that the hypothesis, which allows of a
disinterested benevolence, distinct from self love, has
really more <HI>simplicity</HI> in it, and is more conformable to
the analogy of nature, than that which pretends to re∣solve
all friendship and humanity into this latter prin∣ciple.
There are bodily wants or appetites, acknow∣leged
by every one, which necessarily precede all sen∣sual
enjoyment, and carry us directly to seek possession
of the object. Thus, hunger and thirst have eating
and drinking for their end; and from the grati∣fication
of these primary appetites arises a plea∣sure,
<PB N="20" REF="24"/>
which may become the object of another species
of desire or inclination, that is secondary and interest∣ed.
In the same manner, there are mental passions,
by which we are impelled immediately to seek parti∣cular
objects, such as fame or power, or vengeance,
without any regard to interest; and when these ob∣jects
are attained, a pleasing enjoyment ensues, as the
consequence of our indulged affections. Nature must,
by the internal frame and constitution of the mind,
give an original propensity to fame, ere we can reap
any pleasure from that acquisition, or pursue it from
motives of self-love, and a desire of happiness. If I
have no vanity, I take no delight in praise: If I be
void of ambition, power gives me no enjoyment. If I
be not angry, the punishment of an adversary is to∣tally
indifferent to me. In all these cases, there is a
passon, which points immediately to the object, and
constitutes it our good or happiness; as there are
other secondary passions, which afterwards arise, and
pursue it as a part of our happiness, when once it is
constituted such by our original affections. Were
there no appetites of any kind antecedent to self-love,
that propensity could scarce ever exert itself; because
we should, in that case, have felt few and slender pains
or pleasures, and have little misery or happiness to
avoid or to pursue.</P>
<P>Now where is the difficulty of conceiving, that this
may likewise be the case with benevolence and friend∣ship,
<PB N="21" REF="25"/>
and that, from the original frame of our temper,
we may feel a desire of another's happiness or good,
which, by means of that affection, becomes our own
good, and is afterwards pursued, from the conjoined
motives of benevolence and self-enjoyment? Who
sees not that vengeance, from the force alone of pas∣sion,
may be so eagerly pursued, as to make us know∣ingly
neglect every consideration of ease, interest, or
safety; and, like some vindictive animals, infuse our
very souls into the wounds we give an enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Animasque in vulnere ponunt. VIRG.</P>
<P>Dum alteri noceat, sui negligens, says SENECA of Anger, De Ira, L. X.</P></NOTE>? And
what a malignant philosophy must it be, that will not
allow, to humanity and friendship, the same privi∣leges,
which are indisputably granted to the darker
passions of enmity and resentment? Such a philosophy
is more like a satyr than a true delineation or descrip∣tion
of human nature; and may be a good founda∣tion
for paradoxical wit and raillery, but is a very bad
one for any serious argument or reasoning.</P>

<P>IT may be esteemed, perhaps, a superfluous task to
prove, that the benevolent or softer affections are
VIRTUOUS; and wherever they appear, engage
the esteem, approbation, and good-will of mankind.
The epithets <HI>sociable, good-natured, humane, merciful,
<PB N="22" REF="26"/>
grateful, friendly, generous, beneficent,</HI> are known in all
languages, and universally express the highest merit,
which <HI>human nature</HI> is capable of attaining. Where
these amiable qualities are attended with birth and
power and eminent abilities, and display themselves in
the good government or useful instruction of mankind,
they seem even to raise the possessors of them above
the rank of <HI>human nature,</HI> and approach them in some
measure to the divine. Exalted capacity, undaunted
courage, prosperous success; these may only expose a
hero or politician to the envy and malignity of the
public: But as soon as the praises are added of hu∣mane
and beneficent; when instances are displayed of
lenity, tenderness, or friendship; envy itself is silent,
or joins the general voice of applause and accla∣mation.</P>
<P>WHEN PERICLES, the great ATHENIAN statesman
and general, was on his death-bed, his surrounding
friends, deeming him now insensible, began to in∣dulge
their sorrow for their expiring patron, by enu∣merating
his great qualities and successes, his con∣quests
and victories, the unusual length of his admi∣nistration,
and his nine trophies erected over the ene∣mies
of the republic. <HI>You forget,</HI> cries the dying he∣ro,
who had heard all, <HI>you forget the most eminent of
my praises, while you dwell so much on those vulgar ad∣vantages,
in which fortune had a principal share. You
<PB N="23" REF="27"/>
have not observed, that no citizen has ever yet worne
mourning on my account</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">PLUT. in PERICLE.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN men of more ordinary talents and capacity, the
social virtues become, if possible, still more essentially
requisite; there being nothing eminent, in that case,
to compensate for the want of them, or preserve the
person from our severest hatred, as well as contempt.
A high ambition, an elevated courage, is apt, says
CICERO, in less perfect characters, to degenerate into
a turbulent ferocity. The more social and softer vir∣tues
are there chiefly to be regarded. These are al∣ways
good and amiable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">CIC. de Off<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iis, lib. i.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE principal advantage, which JUVENAL disco∣vers
in the extensive capacity of the human species,
is, that it renders our benevolence also more extensive,
and gives us large opportunities of spreading our
kindly influence than what are indulged to the infe∣rior
creation<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Sat. XV. 139, &amp; seq.</NOTE>. It must, indeed, be confessed, that by
doing good only, can a man truly enjoy the advan∣tages
of being eminent. His exalted station, of it∣self,
but the more exposes him to danger and tumult.
His sole prerogative is to afford shelter to inferiors,
who repose themselves under his cover and pro∣tection.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="28"/>
BUT I forget, that it is not my present business to
recommend generosity and benevolence, or to paint,
in their true colours, all the genuine charms of the
social virtues. These, indeed, sufficiently engage every
heart, on the first apprehension of them; and 'tis dif∣ficult
to abstain from some sally of panegyric, as often
as they occur in discourse or reasoning. But our ob∣ject
here being more the speculative, than the practi∣cal
part of morals, it will suffice to remark, (what
will readily, I believe, be allowed) that no qualities
are more intitled to the general good-will and appro∣bation
of mankind, than beneficence and humanity,
friendship and gratitude, natural affection and public
spirit, or whatever proceeds from a tender sympathy
with others, and a generous concern for our kind and
species. These, wherever they appear, seem to trans∣fuse
themselves, in a manner, into each beholder, and
to call forth, in their own behalf, the same favourable
and affectionate sentiments, which they exert on all
around.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART III.</HEAD>
<P>WE may observe, that in displaying the praises of
any humane, beneficent man, there is one circumstance
which never fails to be amply insisted on, <HI>viz.</HI> the
happiness and satisfaction, derived to society from his
intercourse and good offices. To his parents, we are
apt to say, he endears himself by his pious attach∣ment
<PB N="25" REF="29"/>
and duteous care, still more than by the con∣nexions
of nature. His children never feel his autho∣rity,
but when employed for their advantage. With
him, the ties of love are consolidated by beneficence
and friendship. The ties of friendship approach, in a
fond observance of each obliging office, to those of
love and inclination. His domestics and dependants
have in him a sure resource; and no longer dread the
power of fortune, but so far as she exercises it over
him. From him the hungry receive food, the naked
cloathing, the ignorant and slothful skill and indus∣try.
Like the sun, an inferior minister of providence,
he cheers, invigorates, and sustains the surrounding
world.</P>
<P>IF confined to private life, the sphere of his acti∣vity
is narrower; but his influence is all benign and
gentle. If exalted into a higher station, mankind and
posterity reap the fruit of his labours.</P>
<P>As these topics of praise never fail to be employed,
and with success, where we would inspire esteem for
any one; may it not thence be concluded, that the
UTILITY, resulting from the social virtues, forms,
at least, a <HI>part</HI> of their merit, and is one source of
that approbation and regard so universally paid them.</P>
<P>WHEN we recommend even an animal or plant as
<HI>useful</HI> and <HI>beneficial,</HI> we give it an applause and re∣commendation
<PB N="26" REF="30"/>
suited to its nature. As on the other
hand, reflection on the baneful influence of any of
these inferior beings always inspires us with the sen∣timent
of aversion. The eye is pleased with the pro∣spect
of corn fields and loaded vine-yards; horses gra∣zing,
and flocks pasturing: But flies the view of
bryars and brambles, affording shelter to wolves and
serpents.</P>
<P>A MACHINE, a piece of furniture, a vestment, a
house well contrived for use and conveniency, is so far
beautiful, and is contemplated with pleasure and ap∣probation.
An experienced eye is here sensible to
many excellencies, which escape persons ignorant and
uninstructed.</P>
<P>CAN any thing stronger be said in praise of a pro∣session,
such as merchandize or manufacture, than to
observe the advantages which it procures to society?
And is not a monk and inquisitor enraged, when we
treat his order as useless or pernicious to mankind?</P>
<P>THE historian exults in displaying the benefit ari∣sing
from his labours. The writer of romances alle∣viates
or denies the bad consequences ascribed to his
manner of composition.</P>
<P>IN general, what praise is implied in the simple
epithet, <HI>useful!</HI> What reproach in the contrary!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="31"/>
YOUR Gods, says CICERO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De Nat. Deor. lib. 1.</NOTE>, in opposition to the
EPICUREANS, cannot justly claim any worship or
adoration, with whatever imaginary perfections you
may suppose them endowed. They are totally useless
and inactive. Even the EGYPTIANS, whom you so
much ridicule, never consecrated any animal but on
account of its utility.</P>
<P>THE sceptics assert<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">SEXT. EMP. adversus MATH. lib. 8.</NOTE>, tho' absurdly, that the origin
of all religious worship was derived from the utility of
inanimate objects, as the sun and moon to the support
and well-being of mankind. This is also the com∣mon
reason, assigned by historians, for the deification
of eminent heroes and legislators<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">D<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>OD. SIC. passim.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO plant a tree, to cultivate a field, to beget chil∣dren;
meritorious acts, according to the religion of
ZOROASTER.</P>
<P>IN all determinations of morality, this circumstance
of public utility is ever principally in view; and
wherever disputes arise, either in philosophy or com∣mon
life, concerning the bounds of duty, the question
cannot, by any means, be decided with greater cer∣tainty,
than by ascertaining, on any side, the true in∣terests
of mankind. If any false opinion, embraced
from appearances, has been found to prevail; as soon
as farther experience and sounder reasoning have
<PB N="28" REF="32"/>
given us juster notions of human affairs; we retract
our first sentiments, and adjust anew the boundaries
of moral good and evil.</P>
<P>GIVING alms to common beggars is naturally
praised; because it seems to carry relief to the dis∣tressed
and indigent: But when we observe the en∣couragement
thence arising to idleness and debauch∣ery,
we regard that species of charity rather as a
weakness than a virtue.</P>
<P><HI>Tyrannicide,</HI> or the assassination of usurpers and op∣pressive
princes was highly extolled in antient times;
because it both freed mankind from many of these
monsters, and seemed to keep the others in awe,
whom the sword or poniard could not reach. But
history and experience having since convinced us, that
this practice increases the jealousy and cruelty of prin∣ces,
a TIMOLEON and a BRUTUS, tho' treated with
indulgence on account of the prejudices of their times,
are now considered as very improper models for imita∣tion.</P>
<P>LIBERALITY in princes is regarded as a mark of
beneficence: But when it occurs, that the homely
bread of the honest and industrious is often thereby
converted into de<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>icious cates for the idle and the pro∣diga<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> soon re<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ract our heedless praises. The re∣grets
of a prince, for having lost a day, were noble
<PB N="29" REF="33"/>
and generous: But had he intended to have spent it
in acts of generosity to his greedy courtiers, it was
better lost than misemployed after that manner.</P>
<P>LUXURY, or a refinement on the pleasures and
conveniencies of life, had long been supposed the
source of every corruption in government, and the
immediate cause of faction, sedition, civil wars, and
the total loss of liberty. It was, therefore, universally
regarded as a vice, and was an object of declamation
to all satyrifts, and severe moralists. Those, who
prove, or attempt to prove, that such refinements ra∣ther
tend to the increase of industry, civility, and
arts, regulate anew our <HI>moral</HI> as well as <HI>political</HI> senti∣ments,
and represent, as laudable and innocent, what
had formely been regarded as pernicious and blame∣able.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, then, it seems undeniable, <HI>that</HI>
there is such a sentiment in human nature as disin∣terested
benevolence; <HI>that</HI> nothing can bestow more
merit on any human creature than the possession of it
in an eminent degree; and <HI>that</HI> a <HI>part,</HI> at least, of its
merit arises from its tendency to promote the interests
of our species, and bestow happiness on human so∣ciety.
We carry our view into the salutary conse∣quences
of such a character and disposition; and
whatever has so benign an influence, and forwards so
desirable an end, is beheld with complacency and
<PB N="30" REF="34"/>
pleasure. The social virtues are never regarded with∣out
their beneficial tendencies, nor viewed as barren
and unfruitful. The happiness of mankind, the order
of society, the harmony of families, the mutual sup∣port
of friends, are always considered as the result of
their gentle dominion over the breasts of men.</P>
<P>How considerable a <HI>part</HI> of their merit we ought to
ascribe to their utility, will better appear from future
disquisitions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. 3d and 4th.</NOTE>; as well as the reason, why this cir∣cumstance

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>THAT JUSTICE is useful to society, and conse∣quently
that <HI>part</HI> of its merit, at least, must
arise from that consideration, it would be a superfluous
undertaking to prove. That public utility is the <HI>sole</HI>
origin of justice, and that reflections on the beneficial
consequences of this virtue are the <HI>sole</HI> foundation of
its merit; this proposition, being more curious and
important, will better deserve our examination and
enquiry.</P>
<P>LET us suppose, that nature has bestowed on the
human race such profuse <HI>abundance</HI> of all <HI>external</HI> con∣veniencies,
that, without any uncertainty in the event,
without any care or industry on our part, every indi∣vidual
finds himself fully provided of whatever his
most voracious appetites can want, or luxurious ima∣gination
<PB N="32" REF="36"/>
wish or desire. His natural beauty, we shall
suppose, surpasses all acquired ornaments: The per∣petual
clemency of the seasons renders useless all
cloaths or covering: The raw herbage affords him the
most delicious fare; the clear fountain, the richest
beverage. No laborious occupation required: No
tillage: No navigation. Music, poetry, and contem∣plation
form his sole business: Conversation, mirth,
and friendship his sole amusement.</P>
<P>IT seems evident, that, in such a happy state, every
other social virtue would flourish, and receive a ten∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>old
encrease; but the cautious, jealous virtue of
justice would never once have been dreamt of. For
what purpose make a partition of goods, where every
one has already more than enough? Why give rise
to property, where there cannot possibly be any in∣jury?
Why call this object <HI>mine,</HI> when upon the
seizure of it by another, I need but stretch out my
hand to possess myself of what is equally valuable?
Justice, in that case, being totally USELESS, would
be an idle ceremonial, and could never possibly have
place among the catalogue of virtues.</P>
<P>WE see even in the present necessitous condition
of mankind, that, wherever any benefit is bestowed
by nature in an unlimited abundance, we leave it al∣ways
in common among the whole human race. and
make no subdivisions of right and property. Water
<PB N="33" REF="37"/>
and air, tho' the most necessary of all objects, are
not challenged as the property of individuals; nor
can any man commit injustice by the most lavish use
and enjoyment of these blessings. In fertile extensive
countries, with few inhabitants, land is regarded on
the same footing. And no topic is so much insisted
on by those, who defend the liberty of the seas, as
the unexhausted use of them in navigation. Were the
advantages, procured by navigation, as inexhaustable,
these reasoners had never had any adversaries to re∣fute;
nor had any claims been ever advanced of a
separate, exclusive dominion over the ocean.</P>
<P>IT may happen in some countries, at some periods,
that there be established a property in water, none in
land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">GENESIS, chap. xiii. and xxi.</NOTE>; if the latter be in greater abundance than can
be used by the inhabitants, and the former be found,
with difficulty, and in very small quantities.</P>
<P>AGAIN; suppose, that, tho' the necessities of hu∣man
race continue the same as at present, yet the
mind is so enlarged, and so replete with friendship
and generosity, that every man has the utmost tender∣ness
for every man, and feels no more concern for his
own interest than for that of his fellows: It seems
evident, that the USE of justice would, in this case,
be suspended by such an extensive benevolence, nor
<PB N="34" REF="38"/>
would the divisions and barriers of property and obli∣gation
have ever been thought of. Why should I
bind another, by a deed or promise, to do me any
good-office; when I know he is already prompted, by
the strongest inclination, to seek my happiness, and
would, of himself, perform the desired service; ex∣cept
the hurt, he thereby receives, be greater than
the benefit accruing to me? In which case, he knows,
that from my innate humanity and friendship. I should
be the first to oppose myself to his imprudent gene∣rosity.
Why raise land-marks between my neigh∣bour's
field and mine, when my heart has made no
division between our interests; but shares all his joys
and sorrows with equal force and vivacity as if origi∣nally
my own; Every man, upon this supposition,
being a second-self to another, would trust all his in∣terests
to the discretion of every man; without jea∣lousy,
without partition, without distinction. And
the whole race of mankind would form only one fa∣mily;
where all would lie in common, and be used,
freely, without regard to property; but cautiously
too, with as entire regard to the necessities of each
individual, as if our own interests were most inti∣mately
concerned.</P>
<P>IN the present disposition of the human heart, it
would, perhaps, be difficult to find compleat instances
of such enlarged affections; but still we may observe,
that the case of families approaches towards it; and
<PB N="35" REF="39"/>
the stronger the mutual benevolence is among the in∣dividuals,
the nearer it approaches; 'till all distinction
of property be, in a great measure, lost and confound∣ed
among them. Between married persons, the ce∣ment
of friendship is by the laws supposed so strong
as to abolish all division of possessions; and has often,
in reality, the force ascribed to it. And 'tis observ∣able,
that, during the ardour of new enthusiasms,
where every principle is inflamed into extravagance,
the community of goods has frequently been attempt∣ed;
and nothing but experience of its inconvenien∣cies,
from the returning or disguised selfishness of
men, could make the imprudent fanatics adopt a-new
the ideas of justice and of separate property. So true
is it, that that virtue derives its existence entirely from
its necessary <HI>use</HI> to the intercourse and social state of
mankind.</P>
<P>To make this truth more evident, let us reverse the
foregoing suppositions; and carrying every thing to
the opposite extreme, consider what would be the ef∣fect
of those new situations. Suppose a society to
fall into such want of all common necessaries, that
the utmost frugality and industry cannot preserve the
greatest number from perishing, and the whole from
extreme sufferance: It will readily, I believe, be ad∣mitted,
that the strict laws of justice are suspended,
in such a pressing emergence, and give place to the
stronger motives of necessity and self preservation. Is
<PB N="36" REF="40"/>
it any crime, after a shipwreck, to seize whatever
means or instrument of safety one can lay hold of,
without regard to former limitations of property?
Or if a city besieged were perishing with hunger;
can we imagine, that men will see any means of pre∣servation
before them, and lose their lives, from a
serupulous regard to what, in other situations, would
be the rules of equity and justice? The USE and
TENDENCY of that virtue is to procure happiness
and security, by preserving order in society: But
where the society is ready to perish from extreme ne∣cessity,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o greater evil can be dreaded from violence
and injustice; and every man may now provide for
himself, by all the means, which prudence can dic∣tate,
or humanity permit. The public, even in less
urgent necessities, opens granaries, without the con∣sent
of proprietors; as justly supposing, that the au∣thority
of magistracy may, consistent with equity,
extend so far: But were any number of men to as∣semble,
without the tye of laws or civil jurisdiction;
would an equal partition of bread in a famine, even
without the proprietor's consent, be regarded as cri∣minal
or injurious?</P>
<P>SUPPOSE likewise, that it should be a virtuous
man's fate to fall into the society of ruffians, remote
from the protection of laws and government; what
conduct must he embrace in that melancholy situati∣en?
He sees such a desperate rapaciousness prevail;
<PB N="37" REF="41"/>
such a disregard to equity, such contempt of order,
such stupid blindness to future consequences, as must
immediately have the most tragical conclusion, and
must terminate in destruction to the greater number,
and in a total dissolution of society to the rest. He,
mean while, can have no other expedient than to arm
himself, to whomever the sword he seizes, or the
buckler may belong: To make provision of all means
of defence and security: And his particular regard to
justice being no longer of USE to his own safety or
that of others, he must consult alone the dictates of
self-preservation, without concern for those who no
longer merit his care and attention.</P>
<P>WHEN any man, even in political society, renders
himself, by his crimes, obnoxious to the public, he
is punished by the laws in his goods and person;
that is, the ordinary rules of justice are, with regard
to him, suspended for a moment, and it becomes
equitable to inflict on him, for the <HI>benefit</HI> of society,
what, otherwife, he could not suffer without wrong
or injury.</P>
<P>THE rage and violence of public war; what is it
but a suspension of justice among the warring parties,
who perceive, that that virtue is now no longer of
any <HI>use</HI> or advantage to them? The laws of war,
which then succeed to those of equity and justice, are
rules calculated for the <HI>advantage</HI> and <HI>utility</HI> of that
<PB N="38" REF="42"/>
particular state, in which men are now placed. And
were a civilized nation engaged with barbarians, who
observed no rules even of war; the former must also
suspend their observance of them, where they no
longer serve to any purpose; and must render every
action or rencounter as bloody and pernicious as pos∣sible
to the first aggressors.</P>
<P>THUS the rules of equity or justice depend entirely
on the particular state and condition, in which men
are placed, and owe their origin and existence to that
UTILITY, which results to the public from their
strict and regular observance. Reverse, in any con∣siderable
circumstance, the condition of men: Pro∣duce
extreme abundance or extreme necessity: Im∣plant
in the human breast perfect moderation and hu∣manity,
or perfect rapaciousness and malice: By ren∣dering
justice totally <HI>useless,</HI> you thereby totally de∣stroy
its essence, and suspend its obligation upon
mankind.</P>
<P>THE common situation of society is a medium
amidst all these extremes. We are naturally partial to
ourselves, and to our friends; but are capable of
learning the advantage resulting from a more equitable
conduct. Few enjoyments are given us from the open
and liberal hand of nature; but by art, labour, and
industry, we can extract them in great abundance.
<PB N="39" REF="43"/>
Hence the ideas of property become necessary in all
civil society: Hence justice derives its usefulness to the
public: And hence alone arises its merit and moral
obligation.</P>
<P>THESE conclusions are so natural and obvious, that
they have not escaped even the poets, in their de∣scriptions
of the felicity, attending the golden age or
the reign of SATURN. The seasons, in that first pe∣riod
of nature, were so temperate, if we credit these
agreeable fictions, that there was no necessity for men
to provide themselves with cloaths and houses, as a
security against the violence of heat and cold: The
rivers flowed with wine and milk: The oaks yielded
honey; and nature spontaneously produced her great∣est
delicacies. Nor were these the chief advantages
of that happy age. Tempests were not alone removed
from nature; but those more furious tempests were
unknown to human breasts, which now cause such up∣roar,
and engender such confusion. Avarice, ambi∣tion,
cruelty, selfishness, were never heard of: Cor∣dial
affection, compassion, sympathy, were the only
movements with which the mind was yet acquainted.
Even the punctilious distinction of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine</HI> was
banished from among that happy race of mortals, and
carried with it the very notion of property and obli∣gation,
justice and injustice.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="44"/>
THIS <HI>poetical</HI> fiction of the <HI>golden age</HI> is, in some
respects, of a piece with the <HI>philosophical</HI> fiction of the
<HI>state of nature;</HI> only that the former is represented as
the most charming and most peaceable condition,
which can possibly be imagined; whereas the latter is
painted out as a state of mutual war and violence, at∣tended
with the most extreme necessity. On the first
origin of mankind, as we are told, their ignorance
and savage nature were so prevalent, that they could
give no mutual trust, but must each depend upon
himself, and his own force or cunning for protection
and security. No law was heard of: No rule of
justice known: No distinction of property regarded:
Power was the only measure of right; and a perpe∣tual
war of all against all was the result of men's un∣tamed
selfishness and barbarity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fiction of a state of nature, as a state of war, was not first started by Mr. HOBBES, as is commonly imagined. PLATO endeavours to refute an hypothesis very like it in the 2d, 3d and 4th books de republica. CICERO, on the contrary, supposes it certain and universally acknowledged in the following passage, which is the only authority I shall cite for these reasonings: Not imitating in this the example of PUFFENDORF, nor even that of GROTIUS, who think a verse from OVID or PLAUTUS or PETRONIUS a necessary warrant for every moral truth; or the example of Mr. WOOLASTON, who has constant recourse to HEBREW and ARABIC authors for the same purpose. “Quis enim vestiûm, judices, ignorat, ita naturam rerum tulisse, ut quodam tempore homines, nondum neque naturali, neque civili jure descripto, fusi per agros, ac dispersi vagarentur tan∣tumque haberent quantum manu ac viribus, per caedem a<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> vulnera, aut cripere, aut retinere potuissent?

WHETHER such a condition of human nature could
ever exist, or if it did, could continue so long as to
merit the appellation of a <HI>state,</HI> may justly be doubted.
Men are necessarily born in a family-society, at least;
and are trained up by their parents to some rule of
conduct and behaviour. But this must be admitted,
that if such a state of mutual war and violence was
ever real, the suspension of all laws of justice from
<PB N="42" REF="46"/>
their absolute inutility, is a necessary and infallible
consequence.</P>
<P>The more we vary our views of human life, and
the newer and more unusual the lights are, in which
we survey it, the more shall we be convinced, that
the origin here assigned for the virtue of justice is
real and satisfactory.</P>
<P>WERE there a species of creatures, intermingled
with men, which, tho' rational, were possest of such
inferior strength, both of body and mind, that they
were incapable of all resistance, and could never, up∣on
the highest provocation, make us feel the effects of
their resentment; the necessary consequence, I think,
is, that we should be bound, by the laws of huma∣nity,
to give gentle usage to these creatures, but
should not, properly speaking, lie under any restraint
of justice with regard to them, nor could they possess
any right or property, exclusive of such arbitrary
lords. Our intercourfe with them could not be called
society, which supposes a degree of equality; but ab∣solute
command on the one side, and servile obedi∣ence
on the other. Whatever we covet, they must
instantly resign: Our permission is the only tenure,
by which they hold their possessions: Our compassion
and kindness the only check, by which they curb our
lawless will: And as no inconvenience ever results
from the exercise of a power, so firmly established in
<PB N="43" REF="47"/>
nature, the restraints of justice and property, being
totally <HI>useless,</HI> would never have place in so unequal
a confederacy.</P>
<P>THIS is plainly the situation of men, with regard
to animals; and how far these may be said to possess
reason, I leave it to others to determine. The great
superiority of civilized EUROPEANS above barbarous
INDIANS, tempted us to imagine ourselves on the
same footing with regard to them, and made us throw
off all restraints of justice, and even of humanity, in
our treatment of them. In many nations, the female
sex are reduced to like slavery, and are rendered in∣capable
of all property, in opposition to their lordly
masters. But tho' the males, when united, have, in all
countries, bodily force sufficient to maintain this se∣vere
tyranny; yet such are the insinuation, address,
and charms of their fair companions, that they are
commonly able to break the confederacy, and share
with the other sex in all the rights and privileges of
society.</P>
<P>WERE the human species so framed by nature as
that each individual possest within himself every fa∣culty,
requisite both for his own preservation and for
the propagation of his kind: Were all society and
intercourse cut off between man and man, by the pri∣mary
intention of the supreme Creator: It seems evi∣dent,
that so solitary a being would be as much in∣capable
<PB N="44" REF="48"/>
of justice, as of social discourse and conver∣sation.
Where mutual regards and forbearance serve
no manner of purpose, they would never direct the
conduct of any reasonable man. The headlong course
of the passions would be checked by no reflection on
future consequences. And as each man is here sup∣posed
to love himself alone, and to depend only on
himself and his own activity for safety and happiness,
he would, on every occasion, to the utmost of his
power, challenge the preference above every other
being, to none of which he is bound by any ties,
either of nature or of interest.</P>
<P>BUT suppose the conjunction of the sexes to be esta∣blished
in nature, a family immediately arises; and
particular rules being found requisite for its subsistance,
these are immediately embraced; tho' without com∣prehending
the rest of mankind within their prescrip∣tions.
Suppose, that several families unite together
into one society, which is totally disjoined from all
others, the rules, which preserve peace and order,
enlarge themselves to the utmost extent of that soci∣ety;
but, being then entirely useless, lose their force
when carried one step farther. But again suppose, that
several distinct societies maintain a kind of intercourse
for mutual convenience and advantage, the bounda∣ries
of justice still grow larger, in proportion to the
largeness of men's views, and the force of their mu∣tual
connexions. History, experience, reason suf∣ficiently
<PB N="45" REF="49"/>
instruct us in this natural progress of human
sentiments, and in the gradual encrease of our regards
to property and justice, in proportion as we become
acquainted with the extensive utility of that virtue.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>IF we examine the <HI>particular</HI> laws, by which jus∣tice
is directed, and property determined; we shall
still be presented with the same conclusion. The good
of mankind is the only object of all these laws and
regulations. Not only 'tis requisite for the peace and
interest of society, that men's possessions should be
separated; but the rules, which we follow, in making
the separation, are such as can best be contrived to
serve farther the interests of society.</P>
<P>WE shall suppose, that a creature, possest of rea∣son,
but unacquainted with human nature, delibe∣rates
with himself what RULES of justice or property
would best promote public interest, and establish peace
and security among mankind: His most obvious
thought would be, to assign the largest possessions to
the most extensive virtue, and give every one the
power of doing good, proportioned to his inclination.
In a perfect theocracy, where a being, infinitely in∣telligent,
governs by particular volitions, this rule
would certainly have place and might serve the wisest
purposes: But were mankind to execute such a law;
<PB N="46" REF="50"/>
(so great is the uncertainty of merit, both from its
natural obscurity, and from the self-conceit of each
individual) that no determinate rule of conduct would
ever result from it; and the total dissolution of so∣ciety
must be the immediate consequence. Fanatics
may suppose, <HI>that dominion is founded on grace,</HI> and
<HI>that saints alone inherit the earth;</HI> but the civil magi∣strate
very justly puts these sublime theorists on the
same footing with common robbers, and teaches them,
by the severest discipline, that a rule, which, in spe∣culation,
may seem the most advantageous to society,
may yet be found, in practice, totally pernicious and
destructive.</P>
<P>THAT there were <HI>religious</HI> fanatics of this kind in
ENGLAND, during the civil wars, we learn from his∣tory;
tho' 'tis probable, that the obvious <HI>tendency</HI>
of these principles excited such horror in mankind, as
soon obliged the dangerous enthusiasts to renounce,
or at least conceal their tenets. Perhaps, the <HI>level∣lers,</HI>
who claimed an equal distribution of property,
were a kind of <HI>political</HI> fanatics, which arose from
the religious species, and more openly avowed their
pretensions; as carrying a more plausible appear∣ance,
of being practicable in themselves, as well as
useful to human society.</P>
<P>IT must, indeed, be confessed, that nature is so
liberal to mankind, that were all her presents equally
<PB N="47" REF="51"/>
divided among the species, and improved by art
and industry, every individual would enjoy all the
necessaries, and even most of the comforts of life;
nor would ever be liable to any ills, but such as
might accidentally arise from the sickly frame and
constitution of his body. It must also be confessed,
that, wherever we depart from this equality, we rob
the poor of more satisfaction than we add to the
rich, and that the slight gratification of a frivolous
vanity, in one individual, frequently costs more than
bread to many families, and even provinces. It may
appear withal, that the rule of equality, as it would
be highly <HI>useful,</HI> is not altogether <HI>impracticable;</HI> but
has taken place, at least, in an imperfect degree, in
some republics; particularly that of SPARTA; where
it was attended, as 'tis said, with the most beneficial
consequences. Not to mention, that the AGRARIAN
laws, so frequently claimed in ROME, and carried to
execution in many GREEK cities, proceeded, all of
them, from a general idea of the utility of this prin∣ciple.</P>
<P>BUT historians, and even common sense, may in∣form
us, that however specious these ideas of <HI>perfect</HI>
equality may seem, they are really, at the bottom,
<HI>impracticable;</HI> and were they not so, would be ex∣tremely
<HI>pernicious</HI> to human society. Render posses∣sions
ever so equal, men's different degrees of art,
care, and industry, will immediately break that equa∣lity.
<PB N="48" REF="52"/>
Or if you check these virtues, you reduce so∣ciety
to the extremest indigence; and instead of pre∣venting
want and beggary in a few, render it una∣voidable
to the whole community. The most rigorous
inquisition too, is requisite to watch every inequality
on its first appearance; and the most severe jurisdic∣tion,
to punish and redress it. But besides, that so
much authority must soon degenerate into tyranny,
and be exerted with great partialities; who can pos∣sibly
be possessed of it, in such a situation as is here
supposed? Perfect equality of possessions, destroying
all subordination, weakens extremely the authority of
magistracy, and must reduce all power nearly to a
level, as well as property.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, therefore, that, in order to
establish laws for the regulation of property, we must
be acquainted with the nature and situation of man;
must reject appearances, which may be false, tho'
specious; and must search for those rules, which are,
on the whole, most <HI>useful</HI> and <HI>beneficial.</HI> Vulgar
sense and slight experience are sufficient for this pur∣pose;
where men give not way to too selfish avidity,
or too extensive enthusiasm.</P>
<P>WHO sees not, for instance, that whatever is pro∣duced
or improved by a man's art or industry ought,
for ever, to be secured to him, in order to give en∣couragement
to such <HI>useful</HI> habits and accomplish∣ments?
<PB N="49" REF="53"/>
That the property ought also to descend to
children and relations, for the same <HI>useful</HI> purpose?
That it may be alienated by consent, in order to be∣get
that commerce and intercourse, which is so <HI>bene∣ficial</HI>
to human society? And that all contracts and
promises ought carefully to be fulfilled, in order to
secure mutual trust and confidence, by which the ge∣neral
<HI>interest</HI> of mankind is so much promoted?</P>
<P>EXAMINE the writers on the laws of nature; and
you will always find, that, whatever principles they
set out with, they are sure to terminate here at last,
and to assign, as the ultimate reason for every rule
which they establish, the convenience and necessities
of mankind. A concession thus extorted, in opposi∣tion
to systems, has more authority, than if it had
been made, in prosecution of them.</P>
<P>WHAT other reason, indeed, could writers ever
give, why this must be <HI>mine</HI> and that <HI>yours;</HI> since un∣instructed
nature, surely, never made any such distinc∣tion?
These objects are, of themselves, foreign to
us; they are totally disjoined and separated from us;
and nothing but the general interests of society can
form the connection.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES, the interests of society may require a
rule of justice in a particular case; but may not deter∣mine
any particular rule, among several, which are
all equally beneficial. In that case, the slightest <HI>ana∣logies</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="54"/>
are laid hold of, in order to prevent that indif∣ference
and ambiguity, which would be the source of
perpetual dissentions. Thus possession alone, and first
possession, is supposed to convey property, where no∣body
else has any precedent claim and pretension.
Many of the reasonings of lawyers are of this analo∣gical
nature, and depend on very slight connexions
of the imagination.</P>
<P>DOES any one scruple, in extraordinary cases, to vi∣olate
all regard to the private property of individuals,
and sacrifice to public interest a distinction, which
had been established for the sake of that interest?
The safety of the people is the supreme law: All
other particular laws are subordinate to it, and depen∣dant
on it: And if, in the <HI>common</HI> course of things,
they be followed and regarded; 'tis only because the
public safety and interest, <HI>commonly</HI> demand so equal
and impartial an administration.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES both <HI>utility</HI> and <HI>analogy</HI> fail, and leave
the laws of justice in total uncertainty. Thus, 'tis
highly requisite, that prescription or long possession
should convey property; but what number of days or
months or years should be sufficient for that purpose,
'tis impossible for reason alone to dermine. <HI>Civil laws</HI>
here supply the place of the natural <HI>code,</HI> and assign
different terms for prescription, according to the dif∣ferent
<HI>utilities,</HI> proposed by the legislator. Bills of
<PB N="51" REF="55"/>
exchange and promissory notes, by the laws of most
countries, prescribe sooner than bonds and mortgages,
and contracts of a more formal nature.</P>
<P>IN general we may observe, that all questions of
property are subordinate to the authority of civil laws,
which extend, restrain, modify, and alter the rules of
natural justice, according to the particular <HI>convenience</HI>
of each community. The laws have, or ought to
have, a constant reference to the constitution of go∣vernment,
the manners, the climate, the religion, the
commerce, the situation of each society. A late au∣thor
of genius, as well as learning, has prosecuted
this subject at large, and has established, from these
principles, a system of political knowledge, which
abounds in ingenious and brilliant thoughts, and is
not wanting in solidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of <HI>L'Esprit des Loix.</HI> This illustrious writer, however, sets out with a different theory, and supposes all right to be founded on certain <HI>rapports</HI> or relations; which is a system, that, in my opinion, never will reconcile with true phi∣losophy. Father MALERRANCHE, as far as I can learn, was the first that started▪ this abstract theory of morals, which was afterwards adopted by Dr. CLARKE and others; and as it ex∣cludes all sentiment, and pretends to found every thing on rea∣son, it has not wanted followers in this philosophic age. See Section 1. and Appendix I. With regard to justice, the virtue here treated of, the inference against this theory seems short and conclusive. Property is allowed to be dependant on civil laws; civil laws are allowed to have no other foundation of their au∣thority, and no other object, but the interest of society: This therefore must be allowed to be the sole foundation of property and justice. Not to mention, that our obligation itself to obey the magistrate and his laws is founded on nothing but the inter∣ests of society.</P>
<P>If the ideas of justice, sometimes, do not follow the dispo∣sitions of eivil law; we shall find, that these cases, instead of ob∣jections, are confirmations of the theory delivered above. Where a civil law is so perverse as to cross all the interests of society, it loses all its authority, and men judge by the ideas of natural justice, which are conformable to those interests. Sometimes also civil laws, for useful purposes, require a ceremony or form; and where that is wanting, their decrees run contrary to the usual tenor of justice; but one, who takes advantage of such chi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anes, is not regarded as an honest man. Thus, the interests of society require, that contracts be fulfilled; and there is not a more material article either of natural or civil justice: But the omission of a trifling circumstance will often, by law, invalidate a contract, <HI>in fero bumano,</HI> but not <HI>in foro conscientiae,</HI> as divines express themselves. In these cases, the magistrate is supposed only to withdraw his power of inforcing the right, not to have altered the right. Where his intention extends to the right, and is conformable to the interests of society; it never fails to alter the right; a clear proof of the origin of justice and of pro∣perty, as assigned above.</P></NOTE>.</P>

<HI>WHAT is a man's property?</HI> Any thing, which it
is lawful for him, and for him alone, to use. <HI>But
what rule have we, by which we can distinguish these
objects?</HI> Here we must have recourse to statutes, cus∣toms,
precedents, analogies, and a hundred other
<PB N="53" REF="57"/>
circumstances; fome of which are constant and in∣flexible,
some variable and arbitrary. But the ulti∣mate
point, which they all profeffedly terminate, is,
the interest and happiness of human society. Where
this enters not into confideration, nothing can appear
more whimsical, unnatural, and even superstitious, than
all or most of the laws of justice and of property.</P>
<P><HI>THOSE,</HI> who ridicule vulgar superstitions, and ex∣pose
the folly of particular regards to meats, days,
places, poftures, apparel, have an easy task; while
they consider all the qualities and relations of the ob∣jects,
and discover no adequate cause for that affection
or antipathy, veneration or horror, which have so
mighty an influence over a considerable part of man∣kind.
A SYRIAN would have sturved rather than
taste pigeon; an EGYPTIAN would not have ap∣proached
b<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>con: But if these species of food be exa∣mined
by the senses of sight, smell, or taste, or scruti∣nized
by the sciences of chymistry, medicine, or phy∣sics;
no difference is ever found between them and
any other species, nor can that precise circumstance be
pitched on, which may affored a just foundation for the
religious passion. A fowl on Thursday is lawful food;
on Friday, abominable: Eggs in this house, and in
this diocese, are permitted during Lent; a hundred
paces farther, to eat them is a damnable sin. This
earth or building, yesterday, was profane; to day, by
the muttering of certain words, it has become holy
<PB N="54" REF="58"/>
and sacred. Such reflections as these, in the mouth
of a philosopher, one may safely say, are too obvious
to have any influence; because they must always, to
every man, occur at first sight; and where they pre∣vail
not, of themselves, they are surely obstructed by
education, prejudice and passion, not by ignorance or
mistake.</P>
<P>IT may appear to a careless view, or rather, a too
abstracted reflection, that there enters a like supersti∣tion
into all the regards of justice; and that, if a man
subjects its objects, or what we call property, to the
same scrutiny of sense and science, he will not, by the
most accurate inquiry, find any foundation for the dif∣ference
made by moral sentiment. I may lawfully
nourish myself from this tree; but the fruit of ano∣ther
of the same species, ten paces off, its criminal
for me to touch. Had I worne this apparel an hour
ago, I had merited the severest punishment; but a
man, by pronouncing a few magical syllables, has
now rendered it fit for my use and service. Were
this house placed in the neighbouring territory, it
had been immoral for me to dwell in it; but being
built on this side the river, it is subject to a different
municipal law, and I incur no blame or censure.
The same species of reasoning, it may be thought,
which so successfully exposes superstition, is also appli∣cable
to justice; nor is it possible, in the one case more
than in the other, to point out, in the object, that
<PB N="55" REF="59"/>
precise quality or circumstance, which is the founda∣tion
of the sentiment.</P>
<P>BUT there is this material difference between <HI>super∣stition</HI>
and <HI>justice,</HI> that the former is frivolos, useless,
and burdensome; the latter is absouttely requisite to
the well-being of mankind and existence of society.
When we abstract from this circumstance (for 'tis too
apparent ever to be overlooked) it must be confessed,
that all regards to right and property, seem intirely
without foundation, as much as the grossest and most
vulgar superstition. Were the interests of society no
way concerned, its as unintelligible, why another's
articulating certain sounds, implying consent, should
change the nature of my actions with regard to a par∣ticular
object, as why the reciting of a liturgy by a
priest, in a certain habit and posture, should dedicate
a heap of brick and timber, and render it, thence∣forth
and for ever, sacred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>'Tis evident, that the will or consent alone never transfers property, nor causes the obligation of a promise (for the same reasoning extends to both) but the will must be expressed by words or signs, in order to impose a tye upon any man. The expression, being once brought in as subservient to the will, soon becomes the principal part of the promise; nor will a man be less bound by his word, tho' he secretly give a different direction to his intention, and with-hold the assent of his mind. But tho' the expression makes, on most occasions, the whole of the promise, yet it does not always so; and one who should make use of any expression, of which he knows not the meaning, and which he uses without any sense of the consequences, would not certainly be bound by it. Nay, tho' he know its meaning, yet if he uses it in jest only, and with such signs as show evidently, that he has no serious intention of binding himself, he would not lie under any obligation of performance; but 'tis necessary, that the words be a perfect expression of the will, without any contrary signs. Nay, even this we must not carry so far as to imagine, that one, whom, by our quickness of understanding, we conjecture, from certain signs, to have an intention of deceiving us, is not bound by his expression or verbal promise, if we ac∣cept of it; but must limit this conclusion to those cases where the signs are of a different nature from those of deceit. All those contradictions are easily accounted for, if justice arises intirely from its usefulness to society; but will never be explain∣ed on any other hypothesis.</P>
<P>'Tis remarkable, that the moral decisions of the <HI>Jesuits and other relaxed casuists,</HI> were commonly formed in prosecution of some such subtilties of reasoning as are here pointed out, and proceeded as much from the habit of scholastic refinement as from any corruption of the heart, if we may follow the authority of Mons. BAYLE. See his dictionary, article LOYOLA. And why has the indignation of mankind <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose so high against these casuists; but because every one perceived, that human society could not subsist were such practices authorized, and that morals must always be handled with a view to public interest, more than philosophical regularity? If the secret direction of the in∣tention, said every man of sense, could invalidate a contract; where is our security? And yet a metaphysical schoolman might think, that where an intention was supposed to be requisite, if that intention really had not place, no consequence ought to follow, and no obligation be imposed. The casuistical subtilties may not be greater than the subtilties of lawyers, hinted at above; but as the former are <HI>pernicious,</HI> and the latter <HI>innocent</HI> and even <HI>necessary,</HI> this is the reason of the very different recep∣tion they meet with from the world.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="60"/>
THESE reflections are far from weakening the obli∣gations
of justice, or diminshing any thing from the
<PB N="57" REF="61"/>
most sacred attention to property. On the contrary,
such sentiments must acquire new force from the pre∣sent
reasoning. For what stronger foundation can be
desired or conceived for any duty, than to observe,
that human society, or even human nature could not
subsist, without the establishment of it; and will still
arrive at greater degrees of happiness and perfection,
the more inviolable the reagrd is, which is paid to
that duty?</P>
<P>IF justice arose from a simple, original instinct in
the human breast, without any reflection, even on
those obvious interests of society, which absolutely re∣quire
that virtue; it must follow, that property, which
is the object of justice, is also distinguished by a sim∣ple,
original instinct, and is not ascertained by any
argument or reflection. But who is there that ever
heard of such an instinct? Or is this a subject, in
which new discoveries will be made? We may as
well expect to discover, in the body, new senses,
which had before escaped all mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="62"/>
BUT farther, tho' it seems a very simple proposition
to say, that nature, by an instinctive sentiment, distin∣guishes
property, yet in reality we shall find, that
there are required for that purpose ten thousand dif∣ferent
instincts, and these employed about objects of
the greatest intricacy and nicest discernment. For
when a definition of <HI>property</HI> is demanded, that relation
is found to resolve itself into any possession acquired
by occupation, by industry, by prescription, by inhe∣ritance,
by contract, &amp;c. Can we think, that na∣ture,
by an original instinct, instructs us in all these
methods of acquisition?
THESE words too, inheritance and contract, stand
for ideas infinitely complicated; and to define them
exactly, a thousand volumes of laws, and innumerable
volumes of commentators, have not been found suffi∣cient.
Does nature, whose instincts in men are all
simple, embrace such complicated and artificial ob∣jects,
and create a rational creature, without trusting
any thing to the operation of his reason?
BUT even tho' all this were admitted, it would not
be satisfactory. Positive laws can certainly transfer
property. Is it by another original instinct, that we
recognize the authority of kings and senates, and
mark all the boundaries of their jurisdiction? Judges
too, even tho' their sentence be erroneous and illegal,
must be allowed, for the sake of peace and order, to
<PB N="59" REF="63"/>
have decisive authority, and ultimately to determine
property. Have we original, innate ideas of praetors
and chancellors and juries? Who sees not, that all
these institutions arise merely from the necessities of
human society?</P>
<P>ALL birds of the same species, in every age and
country, build their nests alike: In this we see the
force of instinct. Men, in different times and places,
frame their houses differently: Here we perceive the
influence of reason and custom. A like inference may
be drawn from comparing the instinct of generation
and the institution of property.</P>
<P>HOWEVER great the variety of municipal laws, it
must be confessed that their great lines pretty regu∣larly
concur; because the purposes, to which they tend,
are every where exactly similar. In like manner, all
houses have a roof and walls, and windows and chim∣neys;
tho' infinitely diversified in their shape, figure,
and materials. The purposes of the latter, directed to
the conveniencies of human life, bespeak not more
plainly their origin from reason and reflection, than
do those of the former, which point all to a like end.</P>
<P>I NEED not mention the variations which all the
rules of property receive from the finer turns and con∣nexions
of the imagination, and from the subtilties
and abstractions of law-topics and reasonings. There
<PB N="60" REF="64"/>
is no possibility of reconciling this observation to the
notion of original instincts.</P>
<P>WHAT alone will beget a doubt of the theory, on
which I insist, is the influence of education and ac∣quired
habits, by which we are so accustomed to
blame injustice, that we are not, in every instance,
conscious of any immediate reflection on the perni∣cious
consequences of it. The views the most fami∣liar
to us are apt, for that very reason, to escape us;
and what we have very frequently performed from
certain motives, we are apt likewise to continue me∣chanically,
without recalling, on every occasion, the
reflections, which first determined us. The conve∣nience,
or rather necessity, which leads to justice, is so
universal, and every where points so much to the same
rules, that the habit takes place in all societies; and
it is not without some scrutiny, that we are able to
ascertain its true origin. The matter, however, is
not so obscure, but that, even in common life, we
have, every moment, recourse to the principle of pub∣lic
utility, and ask, <HI>What must become of the world, if
such practices prevail? How could society subsist under
such disorders?</HI> Were the distinction or separation of
posseffions intirely useless, can any one conceive, that
it ever should have obtained in society?</P>
<P>THUS we seem, upon the whole, to have attained
a knowlege of the force of that principle here insisted

on, and can determine what degree of esteem or mo∣ral
approbation may result from reflections on public
interest and utility. The necessity of justice to the
support of society is the SOLE foundation of that
virtue; and since no moral excellence is more highly
esteemed, we may conclude, that this circumstance of
usefulness has, in general, the strongest energy, and
most intire command over our sentiments. It must,
therefore, be the source of a considerable part of the
merit ascribed to humanity, benevolence, friendship,
public spirit, and other social virtues of that stamp;
as it is the SOLE source of the moral approbation
paid to fidelity, justice, veracity, integrity, and those
other estimable and useful qualities and principles.
'Tis intirely agreeable to the rules of philosophy, and
even of common reason; where any principle has
been found to have a great force and energy in one
instance, to ascribe to it a like energy in all similar
instances<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This is Sir ISAAC NEWTON's second rule of philoso∣phizing, <HI>Principia,</HI> lib. 3.</NOTE>.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of POLITICAL SOCIETY.</HEAD>
<P>HAD every man sufficient <HI>sagacity</HI> to perceive, at
all times, the strong interest, which binds him
to the observance of justice and equity, and <HI>strength
of mind</HI> sufficient to persevere in a steady adherence to
a general and a distant interest, in opposition to the
allurements of present pleasure and advantage: There
had never, in that case, been any such thing as go∣vernment
or political society, but each man following
his natural liberty, had lived in intire peace and har∣mony
with all others. What need of positive laws,
where natural justice is, of itself, a sufficient restraint?
Why create magistrates, where there never arises any
disorder or iniquity? Why abridge our native free∣dom,
when, in every instance, the utmost exertion of
it is found innocent and beneficial? 'Tis evident,
that, if government were totally useless, it never could
have place, and that the SOLE foundation of the
duty of ALLEGIANCE is the <HI>advantage</HI> which
<PB N="64" REF="67"/>
it procures to society, by preserving peace and order
among mankind.</P>
<P>WHEN a number of political societies are erected,
and maintain a great intercourse together, a new set
of rules are immediately discovered to be <HI>useful</HI> in that
particular situation; and accordingly take place, un∣der
the title of LAWS of NATIONS. Of this
kind are, the sacredness of the persons of ambassadors,
abstaining from poisoned arms, quarter in war, with
others of that kind, which are plainly calculated for
the <HI>advantage</HI> of states and kingdoms, in their inter∣course
with each other.</P>
<P>THE rules of justice, such as prevail among indi∣viduals,
are not intirely suspended among political so∣cieties.
All princes pretend a regard to the rights of
others; and some, no doubt, without hypocrisy. Al∣liances
and treaties are every day made between inde∣pendent
states, which would only be so much waste of
parchment, if they were not found, by experience, to
have <HI>some</HI> influence and authority. But here is the
difference between kingdoms and individuals. Hu∣man
nature cannot, by any means, subsist, without
the association of individuals; and that association ne∣ver
could have place, were no regard paid to the laws
of equity and justice. Disorder, confusion, the war
of all against all, are the necessary consequences of
such a licentious conduct. But nations can subsist
<PB N="65" REF="68"/>
without intercourse. They may even subsist, in some
degree, under a general war. The observance of
justice, tho' useful among them, is not guarded by so
strong a necessity as among individuals; and the <HI>moral
obligation</HI> holds proportion with the <HI>usefulness.</HI> All
politicians will allow, and most philosophers, that
REASONS of STATE may, in particular emer∣gencies,
dispense with the rules of justice, and invali∣date
any treaty or alliance, where the strict observance
of it would be prejudicial, in a confiderable degree, to
either of the contracting parties. But nothing less
than the extremest necessity, 'tis confest, can justify
individuals in a breach of promise, or an invasion of
the properties of others.</P>
<P>IN a consederated commonwealth, such as the A∣CH<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>AN
republic of old, or the SWI<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>S Cantons and
United Provinces in modern times; as the league has
here a peculiar <HI>utility,</HI> the conditions of union have a
peculiar sacredness and authority, and a violation of
them would be equally criminal, or even more crimi∣nal,
than any private injury or injustice.</P>
<P>THE long and helpless infancy of man requires
the combination of parents for the subsistence of their
young; and that combination requires the virtue of
CHASTITY or fidelity to the marriage<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> bed.
Without such an <HI>utility,</HI> it will readily be owned,
<PB N="66" REF="69"/>
that such a virtue would never have been thought
of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The only solution, which PLATO gives to all the objec∣tions, that might be raised against the community of women, established in his imaginary commonwealth, is, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. <HI>Scite enim istud &amp; dicitur &amp; dicetur,</HI> Id quod utile sit bonestum esse, quod autem inutile sit turpe esse. De Rep. lib. 5. P. 457. ex edit. Serr. And this maxim will admit of no doubt, where public utility is concerned; which is PLATO'S meaning. And indeed to what other purpose do all the ideas of chastity and modesty serve? <HI>Nisi utile est quod facimus, frustra est gloria,</HI> says PHAEDRUS. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> says PLU∣TARCH <HI>de viti<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so pudore.</HI> Nihil eorum quae damnosa sunt, pulchrum est. The same was the opinion of the Stoics. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. SEX. EMP. lib. 3. cap. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN infidelity of this nature is much more <HI>pernicious</HI>
in <HI>women</HI> than in <HI>men.</HI> Hence the laws of chastity
are much stricter over the one sex than over the
other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">These rules have all a reference to generation; and yet women past child-bearing are no more supposed to be exempted from them than those in the flower of their youth and beauty. <HI>General rules</HI> are often extended beyond the principle, whence they first arise; and this in all matters of taste and sentiment. 'Tis a vulgar story at PARIS, that during the rage of the MIS∣SISSIPPI, a hump-backed fellow went every day into the RUE DE QUINCEMPOIX, where the stock-jobbers met in great crowds, and was well paid for allowing them to make use of his hump as a desk, in order to sign their contracts upon it. Would the fortune which he raised by this invention make him a handsome fellow; tho' it be confest, that personal beauty ari∣ses very much from ideas of utility? The imagination is in∣fluenced by associations of ideas; which, tho' they arise at first from the judgment, are not easily altered by every particular ex∣ception that occurs to us. To which we may add, in the present case of chastity, that the example of the old would be pernicious to the young; and that women continually thinking that a cer∣tain time would bring them the liberty of indulgence, would na∣turally advance that period, and think more lightly of this whole duty, so requisite to society.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="70"/>
THOSE who live in the same family have so fre∣quent
opportunities of licence of this kind, that no∣thing
could preserve purity of manners, were mar∣riage
allowed among the nearest relations, or any in∣tercourse
of love between them ratified by law and
custom. INCEST, therefore, being <HI>pernicious</HI> in
a superior degree, has also a superior turpitude and
moral deformity annexed to it.</P>
<P>WHAT is the reason, why, by the ATHENIAN
laws, one might marry a half-sister by the father, but
not by the mother? Plainly this. The manners of
the ATHENIANS were so reserved, that a man was
never permitted to approach the women's apartment,
even in the same family, unless where he visited his
<PB N="68" REF="71"/>
own mother. His step-mother and her children were
as much shut up from him as the women of any other
family, and there was as little danger of any cri∣minal
correspondence between them. Uncles and
nieces, for a like reason, might marry at ATHENS;
but neither these, nor half-brothers and sisters, could
contract that alliance at ROME, where the intercourse
was more open between the sexes. Public utility is
the cause of all these variations.</P>
<P>TO repeat, to a man's prejudice, any thing that
escaped him in private conversation, or to make any
such use of his private letters, is highly blamed. The
free and social intercourse of minds must be extremely
checked, where no such rules of fidelity are esta∣blished.</P>
<P>EVEN in repeating stories, whence we can see no
ill consequences to result, the giving one's authors is
regarded as a piece of indiscretion, if not of immo∣rality.
These stories, in passing from hand to hand,
and receiving all the usual variations, frequently come
about to the persons concerned, and produce animo∣sities
and quarrels among people, whose intentions
are the most innocent and inoffensive.</P>
<P>TO pry into secrets, to open or even read the let∣ters
of others, to play the spy upon their words and
looks and actions: what habits more inconvenient
<PB N="69" REF="72"/>
in society? What habits, of consequence, more
blameable?</P>
<P>THIS principle is also the foundation of most of the
laws of good manners; a kind of lesser morality cal∣culated
for the ease of company and conversation.
Too much or too little ceremony are both blamed,
and every thing, which promotes ease, without an in∣decent
familiarity, is useful and laudable.</P>
<P>CONSTANCY in friendships, attachments, and fa∣miliarities,
is commonly very commendable, and is
requisite to support trust and good correspondence in
society. But in places of general, though casual con∣course,
where the pursuit of health and pleasure
brings people promiscuously together, public conve∣niency
has dispensed with this maxim; and custom
there promotes an unreserved conversation for the
time, by indulging the privilege of dropping after∣wards
every indifferent acquaintance, without breach
of civility or good-manners.</P>
<P>EVEN in societies, which are established on prin∣ciples
the most immoral, and the most destructive to
the interests of the general society, there are required
certain rules, which a species of false honour, as well
as private interest, engages the members to observe.
Robbers and pyrates, it has often been remarked,
could not maintain their pernicious confederacy, did
<PB N="70" REF="73"/>
they not establish a new distributive justice among
themselves, and recall those laws of equity, which
they have violated with the rest of mankind.</P>
<P>I HATE a drinking companion, says the GREEK
proverb, who never forgets. The follies of the last de∣bauch
should be buried in eternal oblivion, in order to
give full scope to the follies of the next.</P>
<P>AMONG nations, where an immoral gallantry, if
covered with a thin veil of mystery, is, in some de∣gree,
authorized by custom, there immediately arise a
set of rules, calculated for the conveniency of that at∣tachment.
The famous court or parliament of love
in PROVENCE decided formally all difficult cases of
this nature.</P>
<P>IN societies for play, there are laws required for the
conduct of the game, and these laws are different in
each game. The foundation, I own, of such societies
is frivolous; and the laws are, in a great measure,
tho' not altogether, capricious and arbitrary. So far
is there a material difference between them and the
rules of justice, fidelity and loyalty. The general so∣cieties
of men are absolutely requisite for the subsis∣tence
of the species; and the public conveniency,
which regulates morals, is inviolably established in
the nature of man, and of the world, in which he
lives. The comparison, therefore, in these respects,
<PB N="71" REF="74"/>
is very imperfect. We may only learn from it the ne∣cessity
of rules, wherever men have any intercourse
with each other.</P>
<P>THEY cannot even pass each other on the road
without rules. Waggoners, coachmen, and postilions
have principles, by which they give way; and these
are chiefly founded on mutual ease and convenience.
Sometimes also they are arbitrary, at least dependent
on a kind of capricious analogy, like many of the
reasonings of lawyers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That the lighter machine yields to the heavier, and, in machines of the same kind, that the empty yield to the loaded: this rule is founded on convenience. That those who are going to the capital take place of those who are coming from it; this seems to be founded on some idea of the dignity of the great city, and of the preference of the future to the past. From like reasons, among foot-walkers, the right-hand intitles a man to the wall, and prevents jostling, which peaceable people find very disagreeable and inconvenient.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To carry the matter farther, we may observe, that
'tis impossible for men so much as to murder each
other without statutes and maxims, and an idea of
justice and honour. War has its laws as well as
peace; and even that sportive kind of war carried on
among wrestlers, boxers, cudgel-players, gladiators, is
regulated by fixed principles. Common interest and
utility beget infallibly a standard of right and wrong
among the parties concerned.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">WHY UTILITY PLEASES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART I.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems so natural a thought to ascribe to their uti∣lity
the praise which we bestow on the social vir∣tues,
that one would expect to meet with this principle
every where in moral writers, as the chief foundation
of their reasoning and inquiry. In common life, we
may observe, that the circumstance of utility is al∣ways
appealed to; nor is it supposed, that a greater
eulogy can be given to any man, than to display his
usefulness to the public, and enumerate the services
which he has perfomed to mankind and society. What
praise, even of an inanimate form, if the regularity
and elegance of its parts destroy not its fitness for any
useful purpose! And how satisfactory an apology for
any disproportion or seeming deformity, if we can
snow the necessity of that particular construction for
the use intended! A ship appears infinitely more beau∣tiful
to an artist, or one moderately skilled in naviga∣tion,
where its prow is wide and swelling beyond its
<PB N="74" REF="76"/>
poop, than if it were framed with a precise geome∣trical
regularity, in contradiction to all the laws of
mechanics. A building, whose doors and windows
were exact squares, would hurt the eye by that very
proportion; as ill adapted to the human figure, for
whose service the fabric was intended. What won∣der
then, that a man, whose habits and conduct are
hurtful to society, and dangerous or pernicious to
every one who has an intercourse with him, should, on
that account, be an object of disapprobation, and
communicate to every spectator the strongest sentiments
of disgust and hatred<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>We ought not to imagine, because an inanimate object may be useful as well as a man, that therefore it ought also, accord∣ing to this system, to merit the appellation of <HI>virtuous.</HI> The sentiments, excited by utility, are, in the two cases, very dif∣ferent; and the one is mixed with affection, esteem, approbation, &amp;c. and not the other. In like manner, an inanimate object may have good colour and proportions as well as a human figure. But can we ever be in love with the former? There are a nu∣merous set of passions and sentiments, of which thinking ratio∣nal beings are, by the original constitution of nature, the only proper objects: And tho' the very same qualities be transferred to an insensible, inanimate being, they will not excite the same sentiments. The beneficial qualities of herbs and minerals are, indeed, sometimes called their <HI>virtues;</HI> but this is an effect of the caprice of language, which ought not to be regarded in rea∣soning. For tho' there be a species of approbation attending even inanimate objects, when beneficial, yet this sentiment is so weak, and so different from what is directed to beneficent ma∣gistrates or statesmen, that they ought not to be ranked under the same class or appellation.</P>
<P>A very small variation of the object, even where the same qualities are preserved, will destroy a sentiment. Thus; the same beauty, transferred to a different sex, excites no amorous passion, where nature is not extremely perverted.</P></NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="77"/>
BUT perhaps the difficulty of accounting for these
effects of usefulness, or its contrary, has kept philo∣sophers
from admitting them into their systems of
ethics, and has induced them rather to employ any
other principle, in explaining the origin of moral
good and evil. But 'tis no just reason for rejecting
any principle, confirmed by experience, that we can∣not
give a satisfactory account of its origin, nor are able
to resolve it into other more general principles. And
if we would employ a little thought on the present
subject, we need be at no loss to account for the influ∣ence
of utility, and to deduce it from principles, the
most known and avowed in human nature.</P>
<P>FROM the apparent usefulness of the social virtues,
it has readily been inferred by sceptics, both ancient
and modern, that all moral distinctions arise from edu∣cation,
and were, at first, invented, and afterwards
encouraged by the art of politicians, in order to ren∣der
men tractable, and subdue their natural ferocity
and selfishness, which incapacitated them for society.
This principle indeed of precept and education, must
<PB N="76" REF="78"/>
be so far owned to have a powerful influence, that it
may frequently increase or diminish, beyond their
natural standard, the sentiments of approbation or dis∣like;
and may even, in particular instances, create,
without any natural principle, a new sentiment of this
kind; as is evident in all superstitious practices and
observances: But that <HI>all</HI> moral affection or dislike
arises from this origin, will never surely be allowed
by any judicious inquirer Had nature made no such
distinction, founded in the original constitution of the
mind, the words, <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>shameful, lovely</HI> and
<HI>odious, no<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le</HI> and <HI>despicable,</HI> had never had place in any
language; nor could politicians, had they invented
these terms, ever have been able to render them intel∣ligible,
or make them convey any idea to the audi∣ence.
So that nothing can be more superficial than
this paradox of the sceptics; and it were well, if▪ in
the abstruser studies of logic and metaphysics, we
could as easily get rid of the cavils of that sect, as in
the more practical and intelligible sciences of politics
and morals.</P>
<P>THE social virtues must, therefore, be allowed to
have a natural beauty and amiableness, which, at first,
antecedent to all precept or education, recommends
them to the esteem of uninstructed mankind, and en∣gages
their affections. And as the public utility of
these virtues is the chief circumstance, whence they
derive their merit, it follows, that the end, which
<PB N="77" REF="79"/>
they have a tendency to promote, must be some way
agreeable to us, and take hold of some natural affec∣tion.
It must please, either from considerations of self-interest,
or from more generous motives and regards.</P>
<P>IT has often been asserted, that, as every man has a
strong connexion with society, and perceives the im∣possibility
of his solitary subsistence, he becomes, on
that account, favourable to all those habits or prin∣ciples,
which promote order in society, and insure to
him the quiet possession of so inestimable a blessing. As
much as we value our own happiness and welfare, as
much must we value the practice of justice and huma∣nity,
by which alone the social confederacy can be
maintained, and every man reap the fruits of mutual
protection and assistance.</P>
<P>THIS deduction of morals from self-love, or a re∣gard
to private interest, is a very obvious thought, and
has not arisen wholly from the wanton fallies and
sportive assaults of the sceptics. To mention no
others, POLYBIUS, one of the gravest and most judi∣cious,
as well as most moral writers of antiquity, has
assigned this selfish origin to all our sentiments of
virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Undutifulness to parents is disapproved of by mankind, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. Ingratitude for a like reason (tho' he seems there to mix a more generous regard) <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Lib. 6. cap. 4. Perhaps the historian only meant, that our sympathy and humanity was more enlivened, by our considering the similarity of our case with that of the persons suffering; which is a just sentiment.</NOTE>. But tho' the solid, practical sense of that
<PB N="78" REF="80"/>
author, and his aversion to all vain subtilties, render
his authority on the present subject very considerable;
yet this is not an affair to be decided by authority;
and the voice of nature and experience seems plainly
to oppose the selfish theory.</P>
<P>WE frequently bestow praise on virtuous actions,
performed in very distant ages and remote countries;
where the utmost subtilty of imagination would not
discover any appearance of self-interest, or find any
connexion of our present happiness and security with
events so widely separated from us.</P>
<P>A generous, a brave, a noble deed, performed by
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
its consequences it may be acknowleged prejudicial to
our particular interest.</P>
<P>WHERE private advantage concurs with general
affection for virtue, we readily perceive and avow the
mixture of these distinct sentiments, which have a
very different feeling and influence on the mind. We
<PB N="79" REF="81"/>
praise, perhaps, with more alacrity, where the gene∣rous,
humane action contributes to our particular in∣terest:
But the topics of praise which we insist on
are very wide of this circumstance. And we may
attempt to bring over others to our sentiments, with∣out
endeavouring to convince them, that they reap
any advantage from the actions, which we recom∣mend
to their approbation and applause.</P>
<P>FRAME the model of a praise-worthy character,
consisting of all the most amiable moral virtues: Give
instances, in which these display themselves, after an
eminent and extraordinary manner: You readily en∣gage
the esteem and approbation of all your audience
who never so much as enquire in what age and coun∣try
the person lived, who possessed these noble qua∣lities:
A circumstance, however, of all others, the
most material to self-love, or a concern for our own
individual happiness.</P>
<P>ONCE on a time, a statesman, in the shock and
concurrence of parties, prevailed so far as to procure,
by his eloquence, the banishment of an able adver∣sary;
whom he secretly followed, offering him mo∣ney
for his support during his exile, and soothing him
with topics of consolation in his misfortunes. <HI>Alas!</HI>
cries the banished statesman, <HI>with what regret must I
leave my friends in this city, where even enemies are so
generous!</HI> Virtue, tho' in an enemy, here pleased
<PB N="80" REF="82"/>
him: And we also give it the just tribute of praise and
approbation; nor do we retract these sentiments,
when we hear, that the action past at ATHENS, about
two thousand years ago, and that the persons names
were ESCHINES and DEMOSTHENES.</P>
<P><HI>WHAT is that to me?</HI> There are few occasions,
when this question is not pertinent: And had it that
universal, infallible influence supposed, it would turn
into ridicule every composition, and almost every con∣versation,
which contain any praise or censure of men
and manners.</P>
<P>'TIS but a weak subtersuge, when pressed by these
facts and arguments, to say, that we transport our∣selves,
by the force of imagination, into distant ages
and countries, and consider the advantage, which we
should have reaped from these characters, had we been
contemporaries, and had any commerce with the persons.
'Tis not conceivable, how a <HI>real</HI> sentiment or passion
can ever arise from a known <HI>imaginary</HI> interest; espe∣cially
when our <HI>real</HI> interest is still kept in view, and
is often acknowledged to be entirely distinct from the
imaginary, and even sometimes opposite to it.</P>
<P>A MAN, brought to the brink of a precipice, can∣not
look down without trembling; and the sentiment
of <HI>imaginary</HI> danger actuates him, in opposition to the
opinion and belief of <HI>real</HI> safety. But the imagina∣tion
<PB N="81" REF="83"/>
is here assisted by the presence of a striking ob∣ject;
and yet prevails not, except it be also aided by
novelty, and the unusual appearance of the object.
Custom soon reconciles us to heights and precipices,
and wears off these false and delusive terrors. The
reverse is observable in the estimates which we form
of characters and manners; and the more we habi∣tuate
ourselves to an accurate scrutiny of the moral
species, the more delicate feeling do we acquire of
the most minute distinctions between vice and virtue.
Such frequent occasion, indeed, have we, in common
life, to pronounce all kinds of moral determinations,
that no object of this kind can be new or unusual to
us; nor could any <HI>false</HI> views or prepossessions main∣tain
their ground against an experience, so common
and familiar. Experience being chiefly what forms
the associations of ideas, 'tis impossible, that any as∣sociation
could establish and support itself, in direct
opposition to that principle.</P>
<P>USEFULNESS is agreeable, and engages our ap∣probation.
This is a matter of fact, confirmed by
daily observation. But, <HI>useful?</HI> For what? For some
body's interest, surely. Whose interest then? Not
our own only: For our approbation frequently ex∣tends
farther. It must, therefore, be the interest of
those, who are served by the character or action ap∣proved
of; and these we may conclude, however re∣mote,
<PB N="82" REF="84"/>
are not totally indifferent to us. By opening
up this principle, we shall discover the great source of
moral distinctions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>SELF-LOVE is a principle in human nature of such
extensive energy, and the interest of each individual
is, in general, so closely connected with that of the
community, that those philosophers were excusable,
who fancied, that all our concern for the public
might be resolved into a concern for our own happi∣ness
and preservation. They saw, every moment,
instances of approbation or blame, satisfaction or dis∣pleasure
towards characters and actions; they deno∣minated
the objects of these sentiments, <HI>virtues</HI> or
<HI>vices;</HI> they observed, that the former had a tendency
to encrease the happiness, and the latter the misery of
society; they asked, whether it was possible that we
could have any general concern for society, or any
disinterested resentment of the welfare or injury of
others; they found it simpler to consider all these sen∣timents
as modifications of self love; and they dis∣covered
a pretext, at least, for this unity of principle,
in that close union of interest, which is so observable
between the public and each individual.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="85"/>
BUT notwithstanding this frequent confusion of in∣terests,
'tis easy to attain what natural philosophers,
after my lord BACON, have affected to call the <HI>expe∣rimentum
crucis,</HI> or that experiment, which points
out the right way in any doubt or ambiguity. We
have found instances, in which private interest was
separated from public; in which it was even contrary:
And yet we observed the moral sentiment to continue,
notwithstanding this disjunction of interests. And
wherever these distinct interests sensibly concurred,
we always found a sensible encrease of the sentiment,
and a more warm affection to virtue, and detestation
of vice, or what we properly call, <HI>gratitude</HI> and <HI>re∣venge.</HI>
Compelled by these instances, we must re∣nounce
the theory, which accounts for every moral
sentiment by the principle of self-love. We must
adopt a more public affection, and allow, that the
interests of society are not, even on their own ac∣count,
entirely indifferent to us. Usefulness is only
a tendency to a certain end; and 'tis a contradiction
in terms, that any thing pleases as means to an end,
where the end itself no way affects us. If therefore
usefulness be a source of moral sentiment, and if this
usefulness be not always considered with a reference
to self; it follows, that every thing, which contributes
to the happiness of society, recommends itself directly
to our approbation and good-will. Here is a prin∣ciple,
which accounts, in great part, for the origin
<PB N="84" REF="86"/>
of morality: And what need we seek for abstruse
and remote systems, when there occurs one so obvious
and natural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis needless to push our researches so far as to ask, why we have humanity or a fellow-feeling with others. 'Tis suffi∣cient, that this is experienced to be a principle in human na∣ture. We must stop somewhere in our examination of causes; and there are, in every science, some general principles, beyond which we cannot hope to find any principle more general. No man is absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of others. The first has a natural tendency to give pleasure; the second, pain. This every one may find in himself. It is not probable, that these principles can be resolved into principles more simple and universal, whatever attempts may have been made to that purpose. But if it were possible, it belongs not to the present subject; and we may here safely consider these principles as original: Happy, if we can render all the consequences suf∣ficiently plain and perspicuous.</NOTE>?</P>
<P>HAVE we any difficulty to comprehend the force of
humanity and benevolence? Or to conceive, that the
very aspect of happiness, joy, prosperity, gives plea∣sure;
that of pain, suffering, sorrow, communicates
uneasiness? The human countenance, says HO∣RACE<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Uti <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>identibus arrident, ita flentibus ad<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lent Humani vultus. HOR.</NOTE>, borrows smiles or tears from the human
countenance. Reduce a person to solitude, and he
<PB N="85" REF="87"/>
loses all enjoyment, except merely of the speculative
kind; and that because the movements of his heart
are not forwarded by correspondent movements in his
fellow-creatures. The signs of sorrow and mourning,
tho' arbitrary, affect us with melancholy; but the
natural symptoms, tears and cries and groans, never
fail to infuse compassion and uneasiness. And if the
effects of misery touch us in so lively a manner; can
we be supposed altogether insensible or indifferent to∣wards
its causes; when a malicious or treacherous
character and behaviour are presented with us?</P>
<P>WE enter, I shall suppose, into a convenient, warm,
well-contrived apartment: We necessarily receive a
pleasure from its very survey; because it presents us
with the pleasing ideas of ease, satisfaction, and en∣joyment.
The hospitable, good-humoured, humane
landlord appears. This circumstance surely must em∣bellish
the whole; nor can we easily forbear reflect∣ing,
with pleasure, on the satisfaction which results
to every one from his intercourse and good-offices.</P>
<P>HIS whole family, by the freedom, ease, confi∣dence,
and calm enjoyment, diffused over their coun∣tenances,
sufficiently express their happiness. I have
a pleasing sympathy in the prospect of so much joy,
and can never consider the source of it, without the
most agreeable emotions.</P>

HE tells me, that an oppressive and powerful neigh∣bour
had attempted to dispossess him of his inheri∣tance,
and had long disturbed all his innocent and so∣cial
pleasures. I feel an immediate indignation arise
in me against such violence and injury.</P>
<P>BUT 'tis no wonder, he adds, that a private wrong
should proceed from a man, who had enslaved pro∣vinces,
depopulated cities, and made the field and
scaffold stream with human blood. I am struck with
horror at the prospect of so much misery, and am
actuated by the strongest antipathy against its author.</P>
<P>IN general, 'tis certain, that wherever we go,
whatever we reflect on or converse about; every thing
still presents us with the view of human happiness or
misery, and excites in our breasts a sympathetic move∣ment
of pleasure or uneasiness. In our serious occu∣pations,
in our careless amusements, this principle still
exerts its active energy.</P>
<P>A MAN, who enters the theatre, is immediately
struck with the view of so great a multitude, partici∣pating
of one common amusement; and experiences
from their very aspect, a superior sensibility or dispo∣sition
of being affected with every sentiment, which he
shares with his fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>HE observes the actors to be animated by the ap∣pearance
of a full audience; and raised to a degree of
<PB N="87" REF="89"/>
enthusiasm, which they cannot command in any soli∣tary
or calm moment.</P>
<P>EVERY movement of the theatre, by a skilful poet,
is communicated, as it were by magic, to the specta∣tors;
who weep, tremble, resent, rejoice, and are
enflamed with all the variety of passions, which actua<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
the several personages of the drama.</P>
<P>WHERE any event crosses our wishes, and inter∣rupts
the happiness of the favourite personages, we
feel a sensible anxiety and concern. But where their
sufferings proceed from the treachery, cruelty or ty∣ranny
of an enemy, our breasts are affected with the
liveliest resentment against the author of these cala∣mities.</P>
<P>'TIS here esteemed contrary to the rules of art to
represent any thing cool and indifferent. A distant
friend, or a confident, who has no immediate interest
in the catastrophe, ought, if possible, to be avoided
by the poet; as communicating a like indifference to
the audience, and checking the progress of the pas∣sions.</P>
<P>NO species of poetry is more entertaining than <HI>pas∣toral;</HI>
and every one is sensible, that the chief source
of its pleasure arises from those images of a gentle and
tender tranquillity, which it represents in its perso∣nages,
<PB N="88" REF="90"/>
and of which it communicates a like sentiment
to the reader. SANNAZARIUS, who transferred the
scene to the sea-shore, tho' he presented the most
magnificent object in nature, is confessed to have
erred in his choice. The idea of toil, labour, and
danger, suffered by the fishermen, is painful; by an
unavoidable sympathy, which attends every concep∣tion
of human happiness or misery.</P>
<P>WHEN I was twenty, says a FRENCH poet, OVID
was my choice: Now I am forty, I declare for HO∣RACE.
We enter, to be sure, more readily into sen∣timents,
which resemble those we feel every moment:
But no passion, when well represented, can be en∣tirely
indifferent to us; because there is none, of
which every man has not within him, at least, the
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eeds and first principles. 'Tis the business of poetry
to approach every object by lively imagery and de∣scription,
and make it look like truth and reality: A
certain proof, that wherever that reality is found,
our minds are disposed to be strongly affected by it.</P>
<P>ANY recent event or piece of news, by which the
fortunes of states, provinces or many individuals are
affected, is extremely interesting even to those whose
welfare is not immediately engaged. Such intelli∣gence
is propagated with celerity, heard with avidity,
and enquired into with attention and concern. The
interests of society appear, on this occasion, to be, in
<PB N="89" REF="91"/>
some degree, the interest of each individual. The
imagination is sure to be affected; tho' the passions
excited may not always be so strong and steady as to
have great influence on the conduct and behaviour.</P>
<P>THE perusal of a history seems a calm entertain∣ment;
but would be no entertainment at all, did not
our hearts beat with correspondent movements to those
described by the historian.</P>
<P>THUCYDIDES and GUICCIARDIN support with
difficulty our attention; while the former describes
the trivial rencounters of the small cities of GREECE,
and the latter the harmless wars of PISA. The few
persons interested, and the small interest fill not the
imagination, and engage not the affections. The
deep distress of the numerous ATHENIAN army be∣fore
SYRACUSE; the danger, which so nearly threatens
VENICE; these excite compassion; these move ter∣ror
and anxiety.</P>
<P>THE indifferent, uninteresting stile of SUETONIUS,
equally with the masterly pencil of TACITUS, may
convince us of the cruel depravity of NERO or TIBE∣RIUS:
But what a difference of sentiment! While
the former coldly related the facts; and the latter sets
before our eyes the venerable figures of a SORANUS
and a THRACEA, intrepid in their fate, and only
moved by the melting sorrows of their friends and
<PB N="90" REF="92"/>
kindred. What sympathy then touches every human
heart! What indignation against the tyrant, whose
causeless fear or unprovoked malice, gave rise to such
detestable barbarity!</P>
<P>IF we bring these subjects nearer: If we remove
all suspicion of fiction and deceit: What powerful
concern is excited, and how much superior, in many
instances, to the narrow attachments of self-love and
private interest! Popular sedition, party zeal, a de∣voted
obedience to factious leaders; these are some of
the most visible, tho' less laudable effects of this social
sympathy in human nature.</P>
<P>THE frivolousness of the subject too, we may ob∣serve,
is not able to detach us entirely from what car∣ries
an image of human sentiment and affection.</P>
<P>WHEN a person s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>utters, and pronounces with dif∣ficulty,
we even sympathize with this trivial uneasi∣ness,
and suffer for him. And 'tis a rule in criticism,
that every combination of syllables or letters, which
gives pain to the organs of speech in the recital, ap∣pears
also, from a species of sympathy, harsh and dis∣agreeable
to the ear. Nay, when we run over a book
with our eye, we are sesible of such unharmonious
composition; because we still imagine, that a person
recites it to us, and suffers from the pronunciation of
these jarring sounds. So delicate is our sympathy!</P>

EASY and unconstrained postures and motions are
always beautiful▪ An air of health and vigour is
agreeable: Cloaths which warm, without burthening
the body; which cover, without imprisoning the

beauty, the sentiments and feelings of the persons af∣fected
enter into consideration, and communicate to
the spectator similar touches of pain or pleasure<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Decentior equus cujus astricta sunt ilia; sed idem velo∣cior.

What wonder, then, if we can pronounce no judg∣ment
concerning the character and conduct of men
without considering the tendencies of their actions,
and the happiness or misery, which thence arises to
society? What association of ideas would ever ope∣rate,
were that principle here totally inactive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In proportion to the station which a man possesses, accord∣ing to the relations in which he is placed; we always expect from him a greater or less degree of good, and when disappointed, blame his intility; and much more, do we blame him, if any ill or prejudice arises from his conduct and behaviour. When the interests of one country interfere with those of another, we estimate the merits of a statesman by the good or ill, which re∣sults to his own country from his measures and councils, with∣out regard to the prejudice which he brings on its enemies and rivals. His fellow-citizens are the objects, which lie nearest the eye, while we determine his character. And as nature has implanted in every one a superior affection to his own country, we never expect any regard to distant nations, where the smallest competition arises. Not to mention, that while every man con∣sults the good of his own community, we are sensible, that the general interest of mankind is better promoted, than by any loose indeterminate views to the good of a species, whence no beneficial action could ever result, for want of a duly limited object, on which they could exert themselves.</NOTE>?</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="94"/>
IF any man, from a cold insensibility, or narrow
selfishness of temper, is unaffected with the images of
human happiness or misery, he must be equally indif∣ferent
to the images of vice and virtue: As on the
other hand, 'tis always found, that a warm concern
for the interests of our species is attended with a de∣licate
feeling of all moral distinctions; a strong re∣sentment
of injury done to men; a lively approbation
of their welfare. In this particular, tho' great supe∣riority
is observable of one man above another; yet
none are so entirely indifferent to the interests of their
fellow-creatures, as to perceive no distinctions of
moral good and evil, in consequence of the different
tendencies of actions and principles. How, indeed,
can we suppose it possible of any one, who wears a
human heart, that, if there be subjected to his cen∣sure,
one character or system of conduct, which is
<PB N="93" REF="95"/>
beneficial, and another, which is pernicious, to his
species or community, he will not so much as give a
cool preference to the former, or ascribe to it the
smallest merit or regard? Let us suppose such a per∣son
ever so selfish; let private interest have ingrossed
ever so much his attention; yet in instances, where
that is not concerned, he must unavoidably feel <HI>some</HI>
propensity to the good of mankind, and make it an
object of choice, if every thing else be equal. Would
any man, who is walking along tread as willingly on
another's gouty toes, whom he has no quarrel with,
as on the hard flint and pavement? There is here
surely a difference in the case. We surely take into
consideration the happiness and misery of others, in
weighing the several motives of action, and incline
to the former, where no private regards draw us to
seek our own promotion or advantage by the injury
of our fellow-creatures. And if the principles of hu∣manity
are capable, in many instances, of influencing
our actions, they must, at all times, have <HI>some</HI> autho∣rity
over our sentiments, and give us a general appro∣bation
of what is useful to society, and blame of what
is dangerous or pernicious. The degrees of these
sentiments may be the subject of controversy; but
the reality of their existence, one should think, must
be admitted, in every theory or system.</P>
<P>A CREATURE, absolutely malicious and spiteful,
were there any such in nature, must be worse than in∣different
<PB N="94" REF="96"/>
to the images of vice and virtue. All his
sentiments must be inverted, and directly opposite to
those, which prevail in the human species. What∣ever
contributes to the good of mankind, as it crosses
the constant bent of his wishes and desires, must pro∣duce
uneasiness and disapprobation; and on the con∣trary,
whatever is the source of disorder and misery
in society, must, for the same reason, be regarded
with pleasure and complacency. TIMON, who pro∣bably
from his affected spleen, more than any invete∣rate
malice, was denominated the man-hater, em∣braced
ALCIBIADES, with great fondness. <HI>Go on,
my boy!</HI> cried he, <HI>acquire the confidence of the people▪
You will one day, 1 foresee, be the cause of great cala∣mities
to them</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCR in vita ALC.</NOTE>: Could we admit the two principles
of the MANICHEANS, 'tis an infallible consequence,
that their sentiments of human actions, as well as of
every thing else, must be totally opposite; and that
every instance of justice and humanity, from its ne∣cessary
tendency, must please the one deity and dis∣please
the other. All mankind so far resemble the
good principle, that where interest or revenge or envy
perverts not our disposition, we are always inclined,
from our natural philanthropy, to give the preference
to the happiness of society, and consequently to vir∣tue,
above its opposite. Absolute, unprovoked, dis∣interested
<PB N="95" REF="97"/>
malice has never, perhaps, place in any
human breast; or if it had, must there pervert all
the sentiments of morals, as well as the feelings of
humanity. If the cruelty of NERO be allowed en∣tirely
voluntary, and not rather the effect of constant
fear and resentment; 'tis evident, that TIGELLINUS,
preferably to SENECA or BURRHUS, must have pos∣sessed
his steady and uniform approbation.</P>
<P>A STATESMAN or patriot, who serves our own
country, in our own time, has always a more passionate
regard paid him, than one whose beneficial influence
operated on distant ages or remote nations; where the
good, resulting from his generous humanity, being
less connected with us, seems more obscure, and af∣fects
us with a less lively sympathy. We may own
the merit to be equally great, tho' our sentiments are
not raised to an equal height, in both cases. The
judgment here corrects the inequalities of our internal
emotions and perceptions; in like manner, as it
preserves us from error, in the several variations of
images, presented to our external senses. The same
object, at a double distance, really throws on the eye
a picture of but half the bulk; and yet we imagine
that it appears of the same size in both situations; be∣cause
we know, that, on our approach to it, its image
would expand on the eye, and that the difference
consisits not in the object itself, but in our position with
<PB N="96" REF="98"/>
regard to it. And, indeed, without such correction
of appearances, both in internal and external senti∣ment,
men could never think or talk steadily, on any
subject; while their fluctuating situations produce a
continual variation on objects, and throw them into
such different and contrary lights and positions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>For a like reason, the tendencies of actions and characters, not their real accidental consequences, are alone regarded in our moral determinations or general judgments; tho' in our real feeling or sentiment, we cannot help paying greater regard to one whose station, joined to virtue, renders him really useful to society, than to one, who exerts the social virtues only in good intentions and benevolent affections. Separating the character from the fortune, by an easy and necessary effort of thought, we pronounce these persons alike, and give them the same general praise. The judgment corrects or endeavours to correct the ap∣pearance: But is not able entirely to prevail over sentiment.</P>
<P>Why is this peach-tree said to be better than that other; but because it produces more or better fruit? And would not the same praise be given it, tho' snails or vermin had destroyed the fruit, before it came to full maturity? In morals too, is not <HI>the tree known by the fruit?</HI> And cannot we easily distinguish between nature and accident, in the one case as well as in the other?</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE more we converse with mankind, and the
greater social intercourse we maintain, the more shall
we be familiarized to these general preferences and
distinctions, without which our conversation and dis∣course
<PB N="97" REF="99"/>
could scarcely be rendered intelligible to each
other. Every man's interest is peculiar to himself,
and the aversions and desires, which result from it,
cannot be supposed to affect others in a like degree.
General language, therefore, being formed for gene∣ral
use, must be moulded on some more general views,
and must affix the epithets of praise or blame, in con∣formity
to sentiments, which arise from the general
interests of the community. And if these sentiments,
in most men, be not so strong as those, which have a
reference to private good; yet still they must make
some distinction, even in persons the most depraved
and selfish; and must attach the notion of good to a
beneficent conduct, and of evil to the contrary. Sym∣pathy,
we shall allow, is much fainter than our con∣cern
for ourselves, and sympathy with persons, remote
from us, much fainter than that with persons, near
and contiguous; but for this very reason, 'tis neces∣sary
for us, in our calm judgments and discourse con∣cerning
the characters of men, to neglect all these
differences, and render our sentiments more public and
social. Besides, that we ourselves often change our
situation in this particular, we every day meet with
persons, who are in a different situation from us, and
who could never converse with us, were we to remain
constantly in that position and point of view, which
is peculiar to ourself. The intercourse of sentiments,
therefore, in society and conversation, makes us form
<PB N="98" REF="100"/>
some general unalterable standard, by which we may
approve or disapprove of characters and manners.
And tho' the heart takes not part entirely with those
general notions, nor regulates all its love and hatred,
by the universal, abstract differences of vice and vir∣tue,
without regard to self or the persons, with whom
we are more immediately connected; yet have these
moral differences a considerable influence, and being
sufficient, at least, for discourse, serve all our purposes
in company, in the pulpit, on the theatre, and in
the schools<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis wisely ordained by nature, that private connexions should commonly prevail over universal views and considerations; otherwise our affections and actions would be dissipated and lost, for want of a proper limited object. Thus a small benefit done to ourselva, or our near friends, excites more lively sentiments of love and approbation than a great benefit done to a distant common-wealth: But still we know here, as in all the senses, to correct these inequalities by reflection, and retain a general standard of vice and virtue, founded chiefly on general usefulness.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, in whatever light we take this subject, the
merit ascribed to the social virtues, appears still uni∣form,
and arises chiefly from that regard, which the
natural sentiment of benevolence engages us to pay
to the interests of mankind and society. If we con∣sider
the principles of the human make; such as they
appear to daily experience and observation; we must,
<PB N="99" REF="101"/>
<HI>a priori,</HI> conclude it impossible for such a creature as
man to be totally indifferent to the well or ill-being of
his fellow-creatures, and not readily, of himself, to
pronounce, where nothing gives him any particular
byass, that what promotes their happiness is good,
what tends to their misery is evil, without any farther
regard or consideration. Here then are the faint ru∣diments,
at least, or out-lines, of a <HI>general</HI> distinction
between actions; and in proportion as the humanity
of the person is supposed to encrease, his connexion
with those injured or benefited, and his lively concep∣tion
of their misery or happiness; his consequent cen∣sure
or approbation acquires proportionable vigour.
There is no necessity, that a generous action, barely
mentioned in an old history, or remote gazette, should
communicate any strong feelings of applause and ad∣miration.
Virtue, placed at such a distance, is like a
fixed star, which, tho', to the eye of reason, it may
appear as luminous as the sun in his meridian, is so
infinitely removed, as to affect the senses, neither with
light nor heat. Bring this virtue nearer, by our ac∣quaintance
or connexion with the persons, or even by
an eloquent recital of the case; our hearts are imme∣diately
caught, our sympathy enlivened, and our cool
approbation converted into the warmest sentiments of
friendship and regard. These seem necessary and in∣fallible
consequences of the general principles of hu∣man
nature, as discovered in common life and prac∣tice.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="102"/>
AGAIN; reverse these views and reasonings: Con∣sider
the matter <HI>a posteriori;</HI> and weighing the conse∣quences,
enquire, if the merit of all social virture is
not derived from the feelings of humanity, with
which it affects the spectators. It appears to be mat∣ter
of fact, that the circumstance of <HI>utility,</HI> in all
subjects, is a source of praise and approbation: That
it is constantly appealed to in all moral decisions con∣cerning
the merit and demerit of actions: That it is
the <HI>sole</HI> source of that high regard paid to justice,
fidelity, honour, allegiance and chastity: That it is
inseparable from all the other social virtues, huma∣nity,
generosity, charity, affability, lenity, mercy and
moderation: And in a word, that it is the foundation
of the chief part of morals, which has a reference to
mankind and our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P>IT appears also, in our general approbation of
characters and manners, that the useful tendency of
the social virtues moves us not by any regards to self-interest,
but has an influence much more universal and
extensive. It appears, that a tendency to public
good, and to the promoting of peace, harmony, and
order in society, does always, by affecting the bene∣volent
principles of our farme, engage us on the side
of the social virtues. And it appears, as an additional
confirmation, that these principles of humanity and
sympathy enter so deep into all our sentiments, and
have so powerful an influence, as may enable them
<PB N="101" REF="103"/>
to excite the strongest censure and applause. The
present theory is the simple result of all these infe∣rences,
each of which seems founded on uniform ex∣perience
and observation.</P>
<P>WERE it doubtful, whether there was any such
principle in our nature as humanity or a concern for
others, yet when we see, in numberless instances, that,
whatever has a tendency to promote the interests of
society, is so highly approved of, we ought thence to
learn the force of the benevolent principle; since 'tis
impossible for any thing to please as means to an end,
where the end is totally indifferent. On the other
hand, were it doubtful whether there was, implanted
in our nature, any general principle of moral blame
and approbation, yet when we see, in numberless in∣stances,
the influence of humanity, we ought thence
to conclude, that 'tis impossible, but that every thing'
which promotes the interest of society, must commu∣nicate
pleasure, and what is pernicious give uneasiness.
But when these different reflections and observations
concur in establishing the same conclusion, must they
not bestow an undisputed evidence upon it?</P>
<P>'TIS however hoped, that the progress of this ar∣gument
will bring a farther confirmation of the pre∣sent
theory, by showing the rise of other sentiments
of esteem and regard from the same or like principles.</P>

<P>NOTHING is more usual, than for philoso∣phers
to encroach upon the province of gram∣marians;
and to engage in disputes of words, while
they imagine, that they are handling controversies of
the deepest importance and concern. Thus, were we
to seek an exact definition or description of those men∣tal
qualities, which are denominated <HI>virtues;</HI> we
might be somewhat at a loss, and might find our∣selves
at first involved in inextricable difficulties. Were
we to say, for instance, that the esteemable qualities
alone, which are voluntary, are entitled to the ap∣pellation
of virtues; we should soon recollect the
qualities of courage, equanimity, patience, self-com∣mand;
with many others, which almost every lan∣guage
classes under the appellation of virtues, tho'
they depend little or nothing on our choice. Should
<PB N="104" REF="105"/>
we affirm, that the qualities alone, which prompt us
to act our part in society, are entitled to that honour∣able
distinction; it must immediately occur, that these
are indeed the most valuable qualities, and are com∣monly
denominated the <HI>social</HI> virtues; but that this
very epithet supposes, that there are also virtues of
another species<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems to me, that in our language there are always said to be virtues of many different kinds; but when a man is said to be <HI>virtueus</HI> or is denominated a man of virtue, we chiefly re∣gard his social qualities, which are indeed the most valuable. They are called the <HI>virtues</HI> by way of excellence.</NOTE>. Should we lay hold of the dis∣tinction
between <HI>intellectual</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> endowments,
and affirm the last alone to be the real and genuine
virtues, because they alone lead to action; we should
find, that many of those qualities, usually called in∣tellectual
virtues, such as prudence, penetration, dis∣cernment,
discretion, had also a considerable influ∣ence
on conduct. The distinction between the <HI>heart</HI>
and the <HI>head</HI> may also be adopted: The qualities of
the first may be defined such as in their immediate
exertion are accompanied with a feeling or sentiment;
and these alone may be called the genuine virtues:
But industry, frugality, temperance, secrecy, per∣feverance,
and many other laudable powers or habits,
generally styled virtues, are exerted without any im∣mediate
sentiment in the person possessed of them;
and are only known to him by their effects. It is
<PB N="105" REF="106"/>
fortunate, amidst all this seeming perplexity, that the
question, being merely verbal, cannot possibly be of
any importance. A moral, philosophical discourse
needs not enter into all these caprices of language,
which are so variable in different dialects, and in dif∣ferent
ages of the same dialect. It may happen, that,
in treating of ethics, we may sometimes mention
laudable qualities, which the ENGLISH tongue does
not always rank under the appellation of virtue; but
we do it only because we are at a loss how to draw the
exact line between the one and the other; or at least
because we consider the question as merely gramma∣tical.
And the more fully to justify our practice in
this particular, we shall endeavour to make it appear,
<HI>first,</HI> that in common life, the sentiments of censure
or approbation, produced by mental qualities of every
kind, are nearly similar; and <HI>secondly,</HI> that all antient
moralists, (the best models) in treating of them, make
little or no difference among them.</P>
<P><HI>FIRST.</HI> It seems certain, that the <HI>sentiment</HI> of
conscious worth, the self-satisfaction, proceeding from
a review of a man's own conduct and character; it
seems certain, I say, that this sentiment, which tho'
the most common of all others, has no proper name
in our language<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The term, pride, is commonly taken in a bad sense; but this sentiment seems indifferent, and may be either good or bad, according as it is well or ill founded, and according to the other circumstances which accompany it. The FRENCH express this sentiment by the term, <HI>amour propre,</HI> but as they also express self-love as well as vanity, by the same term, there arises thence a great confusion in ROCHEFOUCAULT, and many of thier moral writers.</NOTE>, arises from the endowments of cou∣rage
<PB N="106" REF="107"/>
and capacity, industry and ingenuity, as well as
from any other mental excellencies. Who, on the
other hand, is not deeply mortified with reflecting on
his own folly or dissoluteness, and feels not a secret
sting or compunction, whenever his memory presents
any past occurrence, where he behaved with stupidity
or ill-manners? No time can efface the cruel ideas
of a man's own ill-conduct, or of affronts, which
cowardice or impudence has brought upon him. They
still haunt his solitary hours, damp his most aspiring
thoughts, and show him, even to himself, in the most
contemptible and most odious colours imaginable.</P>
<P>WHAT is there too we are more anxious to conceal
from others than such blunders, infirmities, and mean∣nesses,
or more dread to have exposed by raillery and
satyre? And is not the chief object of vanity, our
bravery or learning, our wit or breeding, our elo∣quence
or address, our taste or ability? These we
display with care, if not with ostentation; and com∣monly
show more ambition of excelling in them,
than even in the social virtues themselves, which are,
<PB N="107" REF="108"/>
in reality, of such superior excellence. Good-nature
and honesty, especially the latter, are so indispensibly
required, that, tho' the greatest censure attends any
violation of these duties, no eminent praise follows
such common instances of them, as seem essential to
the support of human society. And hence the rea∣son,
in my opinion, why, tho' men often praise so
liberally the qualities of their heart, they are shy of
commending the endowments of their head: Because
the latter virtues being supposed more rare and extra∣ordinary,
are observed to be the more usual objects of
pride and self conceit; and when boasted of, beget a
strong suspicion of these sentiments.</P>
<P>'TIS hard to tell, whether you hunt a man's cha∣racter
most by calling him a knave or a coward, and
whether a beastly glutton or drunkard be not as odi∣ous
and contemptible, as a selsish, ungenerous miser.
Give me my choice; and I would rather, for my own
happiness and self-enjoyment, have a friendly, hu∣mane
heart than possess all the other virtues of DE∣MOSTHENES
and PHILIP united: But I would rather
pass with the world for one endowed with extensive
genius and intrepid courage, and should thence ex∣pect
stronger instances of general applause and admi∣ration.
The figure which a man makes in life, the
reception which he meets with in company, the
esteem paid him by his acquaintance; all these advan∣tages
depend as much upon his good sense and judg∣ment,
<PB N="108" REF="109"/>
as upon any other part of his character. Had
a man the best intentions in the world, and were the
farthest removed from all injustice and violence, he
would never be able to make himself be much re∣garded,
without a moderate share, at least, of parts
and understanding.</P>
<P>WHAT is it then we can here dispute about? If
sense and courage, temperance and industry, wisdom
and knowledge confessedly form a considerable part
of <HI>personal merit:</HI> If a man possessed of these quali∣ties
is both better satisfied with himself, and better
entitled to the good-will, esteem, and services of others,
than one entirely devoid of them; if, in short, the
<HI>sentiments</HI> be similar, which arise from these endow∣ments
and from the social virtues; is there any reason
for being so extremely scrupulous about a <HI>word,</HI> or
disputing whether they are entitled to the denomina∣tion
of virtue? It may, indeed, be pretended, that
the sentiment of approbation, which those accom∣plishments
produce, besides its being <HI>inferior,</HI> is also
somewhat <HI>different</HI> from that, which attends the vir∣tues
of justice and humanity. But this seems not a
sufficient reason for ranking them entirely under dif∣ferent
classes and appellations. The character of
CAESAR and that of CATO, as drawn by SALLUST,
are both of them virtuous, in the strictest and most
limited sense of the word; but in a different way:
Nor are the sentiments entirely the same, which arise
<PB N="109" REF="110"/>
from them. The one produces love; the other,
esteem: The one is amiable; the other awful: We
could wish to meet the one character in a friend; of
the other we should be ambitious in ourselves. In
like manner the approbation, which attends tempe∣rance
or industry or frugality, may be somewhat dif∣ferent
from that which is paid to the social virtues,
without making them entirely of a different species.
And indeed, we may observe, that these endowments,
no more than the other virtues, produce not, all of
them, the same kind of approbation. Good sense
and genius beget esteem and regard: Wit and hu∣mour
excite love and affection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Love and esteem are nearly the same passion, and arise from similar causes. The qualities, which produce both, are such as communicate pleasure. But where this pleasure is se∣vere and serious; or where its object is great and makes a strong impression, or where it produces any degree of humility and awe: In all these cases, the passion, which arises from the pleasure, is more properly denominated esteem than love. Be∣nevolence attends both: But is connected with love in a more eminent degree. There seems to be still a stronger mixture of pride in contempt than of humility in esteem; and the reason would not be difficult to one, who studied accurately the pas∣sions. All these various mixtures and compositions and appear∣ances of sentiment form a very curious subject of speculation, but are wide of our present purpose. Thro'out this enquiry, we always consider in general, what qualities are a subject of praise or of censure, without entering into all the minute diffe∣rences of sentiment, which they excite. 'Tis evident, that whatever is contemned, is also disliked, as well as what is hated; and we here endeavour to take objects, according to their most simple views and appearances. These sciences are but too apt to appear abstract to common readers, even with all the precautions which we can take to clear them from superflu∣ous speculations, and bring them down to every capacity.</NOTE>.</P>

PLUTARCH is no more cramped by systems in his
philosophy than in his history. Where he compares
the great men of GREECE and ROME, he fairly sets
in opposition all their blemishes and accomplishements
of whatever kind, and omits nothing considerable▪
which can either depress or exalt their characters.
His moral discourses contain the same free and natural
censure of men and manners.</P>
<P>THE character of HANNIBAL, as drawn by LIVY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 21. cap. 4.</NOTE>,
is esteemed partial, but allows him many eminent
virtues. Never was there a genius, says the historian,
more equally fitted for those opposite offices of com∣mand
and obedience; and it were, therefore, difficult
to determine whether he redered himself <HI>dearer</HI> to the
general or to the army. To none, would HASDRUBAL
entrust more willingly the conduct of any dangerous
enterprize; under none, did the soldiers discover more
courage and confidence. Great boldness in facing
danger; great prudence in the midst of it. No la∣bour
could fatigue his body or subdue his mind. Cold
and heat were indifferent to him: Meat and drink he
fought as supplies to the necessities of nature, not as
gratifications of his voluptuous appetites: Waking or
rest he used indiscriminately, by night or by day.—
These great VIRTUES were ballanced by great
VICES: Inhuman cruelty; perfidy more than <HI>punic;</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="115"/>
no truth, no faith, no regard to oaths, promises or
religion.</P>
<P>THE character of ALEXANDER the sixth, to be
found in GUICCIARDIN<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>, is pretty similar, but just∣er;
and is a proof, that even the moderns, where
they speak naturally, hold the same language with
the antients. In this pope, says he, there was a
singular capacity and judgment: Admirable pru∣dence;
a wonderful talent of persuasion; and in all
momentous enterprizes, a diligence and dexterity in∣credible.
But these <HI>virtues</HI> were infinitely overbal∣lanced
by his <HI>vices;</HI> no faith, no religion, insatiable
avarice, exorbitant ambition, and a more than bar∣barous
cruelty.</P>
<P>POLYBIUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12.</NOTE>, reprehending TIMAEUS for his par∣tiality
against AGATHOCLES, whom he himself al∣lows
to be the most cruel and impious of all tyrants,
says: If he took refuge in SYRACUSE, as asserted by
that historian, flying the dirt and smoke and toil of his
former profession of a potter; and if, proceeding from
such slender beginnings, he became masfter, in a little
time, of all SICILY; brought the CARTHAGINIAN
state into the utmost danger; and at last died in an
old age, and in possession of kingly dignity: Must
he not be allowed something prodigious and extraor∣dinary,
<PB N="115" REF="116"/>
and to have possessed great talents and capacity
for business and action? His historian, therefore,
ought not to have alone related what tended to his
reproach and infamy; but also what might redound
to his PRAISE and HONOUR.</P>
<P>IN general, we may observe, that the distinction
of voluntary or involuntary was little regarded by the
antients in their moral reasonings; where they fre∣quently
treated the question as very doubtful, <HI>whether
virtue could be taught or not</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. PLATO in MENONE, SENECA <HI>de otio sap.</HI> cap. 31. So also HORACE, <HI>Virtutem doctrina paret, naturane donet.</HI> Epist. lib. 1. cp. 18. AESCMINES SOCRATICUS. Dial. 1.</NOTE>? They justly considered,
that cowardice, meanness, levity, anxiety, impa∣tience,
folly, and many other qualities of the mind,
might appear ridiculous and deformed, contemptible
and odious, though independant of the will. Nor
could it be supposed, at all times, in every man's
power to attain every kind of mental, more than of
exterior beauty.</P>
<P>BUT modern philosophers, treating all morals, as
on a like footing with civil laws, guarded by the
sanctions of reward and punishment, were necessarily
led to render this circumstance, of <HI>voluntary</HI> or <HI>in∣voluntary,</HI>
the foundation of their whole theory.
Every one may employ <HI>terms</HI> in what sense he pleases:
<PB N="116" REF="117"/>
But this, in the mean time, must be allowed, that
<HI>sentiments</HI> are every day experienced of blame and
praise, which have objects beyond the dominion of the
will or choice, and of which it behoves us, if not as
moralists, as speculative philosophers at least, to give
some satisfactory theory and explication.</P>
<P>A BLEMISH, a fault, a vice, a crime; these ex∣pressions
seem to denote different degrees of censure
and disapprobation; which are, however, all of
them, at the bottom, pretty nearly of the same kind
or species. The explication of one will lead us easily
into a just conception of the others; and it is of greater
consequence to attend to things than to verbal deno∣minations.
That we owe a duty to ourselves is con∣fessed
even in the most vulgar ststem of morals; and
it must be of consequence to examine that duty in
order to see, whether it bears any analogy to that
which we owe to society. It is probable, that the ap∣probation,
attending the observance of both, is of a
similar nature, and arises from similar principles;
whatever appellation we may give to either of these
excellencies.</P>

<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems evident, that where a quality or habit is
subjected to our examination, if it appear, in any re∣spect,
prejudicial to the person, possessed of it, or
such as incapacitates him for business and action, it is
<PB N="117" REF="118"/>
instantly blamed, and ranked among his faults and
imperfections. Indolence, negligence, want of or∣der
and method, obstinacy, fickleness, rashness, cre∣dulity;
these qualities were never esteemed by any
one indifferent to a character; much less, extolled as
accomplishments or virtues. The prejudice, resulting
from them, immediately strikes our eye, and gives
us the sentiment of pain and disapprobation.</P>
<P>NO quality, 'tis allowed, is absolutely either blame∣able
or praise-worthy. 'Tis all according to its de∣gree.
A due medium, say the PERIPATETICS, is
the charecteristic of virtue. But this medium is chiefly
determined by utility. A proper celerity, for in∣stance,
and dispatch in business, is commendable.
When defective, no progress is ever made in the exe∣cution
of any purpose: When excessive, it engages
us in precipitate, and ill-concerted measures and en∣terprizes:
By such reasonings as these we fix the pro∣per
and commendable mediocrity in all moral and
prudential disquisitions; and never lose view of the
advantages, which result from any character or
habit.</P>
<P>Now as these advantages are enjoyed by the per∣son,
possessed of the character, it can never be <HI>self∣love,</HI>
which renders the prospect of them agreeable to
us, the spectators, and prompts our esteem and ap∣probation.
<PB N="118" REF="119"/>
NO force of imagination can convert us
into another person, and make us fancy, that we,
being that person, reap benefit from those valuable
qualities, which belong to him. Or if it did, no ce∣lerity
of imagination could immediately transport us
back, into ourselves, and make us love and esteem
the person, as different from us. Views and senti∣ments,
so opposite to known truth, and to each other,
could never have place, at the same time, in the
same person. All suspicion, therefore, of selfish re∣gards,
is here totally excluded. 'Tis a quite different
principle, which actuates our bosom, and interests us
in the felicity of the person whom we contemplate.
Where his natural talents and acquired abilities give
us the prospect of elevation, advancement, a figure
in life, prosperous success, a steady command over
fortune, and the execution of great or advantageous
undertakings; we are struck with such agreeable
images, and feel a complacency and regard imme∣diately
arise towards him. The ideas of happiness,
joy, triumph, prosperity, are connected with every
circumstance of his character, and diffuse over our
minds a pleasing sentiment of sympathy and hu∣manity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One may venture to affirm, that there is no human crea∣ture, to whom the appearance of happiness, (where envy or revenge has no place) does not give pleasure, that of misery, uneasiness. This seems inseparable from our make and constitu∣tion. But they are only the more generous minds, that are thence prompted to seek zealously the good of others, and to have a real passion for their welfare. With men of narrow and ungenerous spirits, this sympathy goes not beyond a slight feel∣ing of the imagination, which serves only to excite sentiments of complacency or censure, and makes them appley to the object either honourable or dishonourable appellations. A griping miser, for instance, praises extremely <HI>industry</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> even in others, and sets them, in his estimation, above all the other virtues. He knows the good, that results from them, and feels that species of happiness with a more lively sympathy, than any other you could represent to him; though perhaps he would not part with a shilling to make the fortune of the industrious man, whom he praises so highly.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="120"/>
LET us suppose a person originally so framed as to
have no manner of concern for his fellow-creatures,
but to regard the happiness and misery of all sensible
beings with greater indifference than even two con∣tiguous
shades of the same colour. Let us suppose, if
the prosperity of nations were laid on the one hand,
and their ruin on the other, and he were desired to
choose; that he would stand, like the schoolman's
ass, irresolute and undetermined, between equal
motives; or rather, like the same ass between two
pieces of wood or marble, without any inclination or
propensity to either side. The consequence, I be∣lieve,
must be allowed just, that such a person, being
absolutely unconcerned, either in the public good of
a community or the private utility of others, would
<PB N="120" REF="121"/>
look on every quality, however pernicious, or how∣ever
beneficial, to society, or to its possessor, with
the same indifference as on the most common and un∣interesting
object.</P>
<P>BUT if, instead of this fancied monster, we suppose
a <HI>man</HI> to form a judgment or determination in the
case, there is to him a plain foundation of preference,
where every thing else is equal; and however cool his
choice may be, if his heart be selfish, or if the persons
interested be remote from him; there must still be a
choice, or distinction between what is useful, and
what is pernicious. Now this distinction is the same
in all its parts, with the <HI>moral distinction,</HI> whose foun∣dation
has been so often, and so much in vain, en∣quired
after. The same endowments of the mind,
in every circumstance, are agreeable to the sentiment
of morals and to that of humanity; the same temper is
susceptible of high degrees of the one sentiment and
of the other; and the same alteration in the objects,
by their nearer approach or by connexions, enlivens
the one and the other. By all the rules of philosophy,
therefore, we must conclude, that these sentiments
are originally the same; since, in each particular, even
the most minute, they are governed by the same laws,
and are moved by the same objects.</P>
<P>WHY do philosophers infer, with the greatest cer∣tainty,
that the moon is kept in its orbit by the same
<PB N="121" REF="122"/>
force of gravity, which make bodies fall near the
surface of the earth, but because these effects are,
upon computation, found similar and equal? And
must not this argument bring as strong conviction, in
moral as in natural disquisitions?</P>
<P>TO prove, by any long detail, that all the quali∣ties,
useful to the possessor, are approved, and the
contrary censured, would be superfluous. The least
reflection. on what is every day experienced in life,
will be sufficient. We shall only mention a few in∣stances,
in order to remove, if possible, all doubt and
hesitation.</P>
<P>THE quality the most necessary for the execution
of any useful enterprize, is DISCRETION; by
which we carry on a safe intercourse with others,
give due attention to our own and to their character,
weigh each circumstance of the business which we
undertake, and employ the surest and safest means for
the attainment of any end or purpose. To a CROM∣WEL,
perhaps, or a DE RETZ, discretion may appear
an alderman-like virtue, as Dr. SWIFT calls it; and
being incompatible with those vast designs, to which
their courage and ambition prompted them, it might
really, in them, be a fault or imperfection. But in
the conduct of ordinary life, no virtue is more requi∣site,
not only to obtain success, but to avoid the most
fatal miscarriages and disappointments. The greatest
<PB N="122" REF="123"/>
parts without it, as observed by an elegant writer,
may be fatal to their owner; as POLYPHEMUS de∣prived
of his eye was only the more exposed, on ac∣count
of his enormous strength and stature.</P>
<P>THE best character, indeed, were it not rather too
perfect for human nature, is that which gives nothing
to temper of any kind; but alternately employs en∣terprise
and caution, as each is <HI>useful</HI> to the particu∣lar
purpose intended. Such is the excellence which
St. EVREMOND ascribes to mareschal TURENNE,
who displayed every campaign, as he grew older,
more temerity in his military enterprises; and being
now, from long experience, perfectly acquainted with
every incident in war, he advanced with greater
firmness and security, in a road so well known to him.
FABIUS, says MACHIAVEL, was cautious; SCIPIO
enterprising: And both succeeded, because the situa∣tion
of the ROMAN affairs, during the command of
each, was peculiarly adapted to his genius; but both
would have failed, and these situations been inverted.
He is happy, whose circumstances suit his temper;
but he is more excellent, who can suit his temper
to any circumstances.</P>
<P>WHAT need is there to display the praises of IN∣DUSTRY,
and to extol its advantages, in the
acquisition of power and riches, or in raising what we
<PB N="123" REF="124"/>
call a <HI>fortune</HI> in the world? The tortoise, according
to the fable, by his assiduity, gained the race of the
hare, though possessed of much superior swiftness. A
man's time, when well husbanded, is like cultivated
field, of which a few acres produce more of what is
useful to life, than extensive provinces, even of the
richest soil, when over-run with weeds and brambles.</P>
<P>BUT all prospect of success in life, or even of toler∣able
subsistence, must fail, where a reasonable FRU∣GALITY
is wanting. The heap, instead of in∣creasing,
diminishes daily, and leaves its possessor so
much more unhappy, that not having been able to
confine his expences to a large revenue, he will still
less be able to live contentedly on a small one. The
souls of men, according to PLATO<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phaedo.</NOTE>, inflamed with
impure appetites, and losing the body, which alone
afforded means of satisfaction, hover about the earth,
and haunt the places, where their bodies are deposited;
possest with a longing defire to recover the lost or∣gans
of sensation. So may we fee worthless prodi∣gals,
having consumed their fortunes in wild de∣bauches,
thrusting themselves into every plentiful
table, and every party of pleasure, hated even by the
vicious, and despised even by fools.</P>
<P>THE one extreme of frugality is <HI>avarice,</HI> which,
as it both doprives a man of all use of his riches, and
<PB N="124" REF="125"/>
checks hospitality and every social enjoyment, is
justly censured on a double account. <HI>Prodigality,</HI> the
other extreme, is commonly more hurtful to a man
himself; and each of these extremes is blamed above
the other, according to the temper of the person who
censures, and according to his greater or less sensibility
to pleasure, either social or sensual.</P>
<P>QUALITIES often derive their merit from compli∣cated
sources. <HI>Honesty, fidelity, truth,</HI> are praised for
their immediate tendency to promote the interests of
society; but they are also considered as advantageous
to the person himself, and as the source of that trust
and confidence, which can alone give a man any con∣sideration
in life. One becomes contemptible, as
well as odious, when he forgets the duty which in
this particular he owes to himself as well as to
society.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, this consideration is the <HI>chief</HI>source of
the high blame, which is thrown on any instance of
faiture among women in point of <HI>chastity.</HI> The
greatest consideration, which can be acquired by that
sense, is derived from their fidelity; and a woman is
cheap and vulgar, loses her rank, and is exposed
to every insult, who is deficient in this particular.
The smallest failure is here sufficient to blast her cha∣racter!
A female has so many opportunities of secretly
indulging these appetites, that nothing can give us
<PB N="125" REF="126"/>
security but her absolute modefty and reserve; and
where a breach is once made, it can scarcely ever be
fully repaired. If a man behaves with cowardice on
one occasion, a contrary conduct re-instates him in his
character. But by what action can a woman, whose
behaviour has once been dissolute, be able to assure
us, that she has formed better resolutions, and has
self-command enough to carry them into practice?</P>
<P>ALL men, 'tis allowed, are equally defirous of
happiness; but few are successful in the pursuit: One
chief cause is the want of STRENGTH of MIND,
which might enable them to resist the temptation of
present ease or pleasure, and carry them forward in
the search of more distant profit and enjoyment. Our
affections, on a general prospect of their objects, from
certain rules of conduct, and certain measures of pre∣ference
of one above another: And thefe decisions,
though really the result of our calm passions, and
propensities, (for what else can pronounce any object

approach nearer us, or acquire the advantages of
favourable lights and positions, which catch the heart
or imagination; our general resolutions are frequently
confounded, a small enjoyment preferred, and lasting
shame and sorrow entailed upon us. And however
<PB N="126" REF="127"/>
poets may employ their wit and eloquence, in cele∣brating
present pleasure, and rejecting all distant
views to fame, health, or fortune; 'tis obvious, that
this practice is the source of all dissoluteness and disor∣der,
repentance and misery. A man of strong and
determined temper adheres tenaciously to his general
resolutions, and is neither seduced by the allurements
or pleasure, nor terrified by the menaces of pain; but
keeps still in view those distant pu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>suits, by which he,
at once, ensures his happiness and his honour.</P>
<P>SELF-SATISFACTION, at least in some degree, is an
advantage, which equally attends the FOOL and the
WISE-MAN: But 'tis the only one; nor is there
any other circumstance in the conduct of life, where
they are upon an equal footing. Business, books,

and except condemned by his station to the
coarsest drudgery, remains a <HI>useless</HI> burthen upon the
earth. A cordingly, 'tis found, that men are in∣finitely
jealous of their character in this particular;
and many instances are seen of profligacy and treache∣ry,
the most avowed, and unre<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erved; none of bear∣ing

DICAEARCHUS, the MACEDONIAN general,
who▪ as POLYBIUS tells us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17. cap. 35.</NOTE>, openly erected one
altar to impiety, and another to injustice, in order to
<PB N="127" REF="128"/>
bid defiance to mankind; even he, I am well assured,
would have started at the epithet of <HI>fool,</HI> and have
meditated revenge for so injurious an appellation.
Except the affection of parents, the strongest and
most indissoluble bond in nature, no connexion has
strength sufficient to support the disgust arising from
this character. Love itself, which can subsist under
treachery, ingratitude, malice, and infidelity, is im∣mediately
extinguished by it, when perceived and ac∣knowleged;
nor are deformity and old-age more
fatal to the dominion of that passion. So dreadful
are the ideas of an utter incapacity for any purpose or
undertaking, and of continued error and misconduct
in life!</P>
<P>WHEN 'tis asked, whether a quick or a slow appre∣hension
be most valuable? Whether one, that, at first
view, penetrates far into a subject, but can perform
nothing upon study; or a contrary character, which
must work out every thing by dint of application?
Whether a clear head or a copious invention? Whe∣ther
a profound genius or a sure judgment? In short,
what character, or peculiar turn of understanding is
more excellent than another? 'Tis evident, that we
can answer none of these questions, without consider∣ing
which of those qualities capacitates a man best
for the world, and carries him farthest in any under∣taking.</P>

IF refined sense and exalted sense be not so <HI>useful</HI>
as common sense, their rarity, their novelty, and the
nobleness of their objects make some compensation,
and render them the admiration of mankind: As
gold, though less serviceable than iron, acquires,
from its scarcity, a value, which is much superior.</P>
<P>THE defects of judgment can be supplied by no
art or invention; but those of MEMORY frequently
may, both in business and in study, by method and
industry, and by diligence in committing every thing
to writing; and we scarce ever hear a short memory
given as a reason for a man's want of success in any
undertaking. But in antient times, when no man
could make a figure without the talent of speaking,
and when the audience were too delicate to bear such
crude, undigested harangues as our extemporary ora∣tors
offer to public assemblies; the faculty of memory
was then of the utmost consequence, and was accord∣ingly
much more valned than at present. Scarce any
great genius is mentioned in antiquity, who is not
celebrated for this talent; and CICERO enumerates it
among the other sublime qualities of CAESAR him∣self<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio, memoria, literae, sura, cogi∣tatio, diligentia, &amp;c. PHILIP. 2.</NOTE>.</P>

Particular situations and accidents have, in some de∣gree,

esteemed, who po<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>esses those talents and accomplish∣ments,
which suit his station, and profession, than he
whom fortune has misplaced in the part which she has
assigned him. The private or selfish virtues are, in this
respect, more arbitrary than the public and social.
In other respects, they are, perhaps, less liable to
doubt and controversy.</P>
<P>IN this kingdom, such continued ostentation, of
late years, has appeared among men in <HI>active</HI> life,
with regard to <HI>public spirit,</HI> and among those in <HI>specu∣lative</HI>
with regard to <HI>benevolence;</HI> and so many false
pretensions to each have been, no doubt, detected,
that men of the world are apt, without any bad inten∣tion,
to discover a sullen incredulity on the head of
these moral endowments, and even sometimes abso∣lutely
to deny their existence and reality. In like
manner, I find, that, of old, the perpetual cant of
the <HI>Stoics</HI> and <HI>Cynics</HI> concerning <HI>virtue,</HI> their magni∣ficent
professions and slender performances, bred a
disgust in mankind; and LUCIAN, who, though li∣centious
with regard to pleasure, is yet, in other re∣spects,
a very moral writer, cannot, sometimes, talk
of virtue, so much boasted, without betraying symp∣toms
<PB N="130" REF="131"/>
of spleen and irony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. LUC. TIMON.; Again, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> Decr. Concil.</NOTE>. But surely, this peevish
delicacy, whence-ever it arises, can never be carried
so far as to make us deny the existence of every species
of virtue, and all distinction of manners and beha∣viour.
Besides <HI>discretion, caution, enterprise, indus∣try,
assiduity, frugality, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>conomy, good-sense, prudence,
discernment;</HI> besides these virtues, I say, whose very
names force an avowal of their merit, there are many
others, to which the most determined scepticism can∣not,
for a moment, refuse the tribute of praise and
approbation. <HI>Temperance, sobriety, patience, constan∣cy,
persever<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce, forethought, considerateness, secrecy,
order, insinuation, address, presence of mind, quickness
of conception, facility of expression;</HI> these, and a thou∣sand
more of the same kind, no man will ever deny
to be excellencies and endowments. As their merit
consists in their tendency to serve the person, posses∣sed
of them, without any magnificent claims of public
and social defert, we are the less jealous of their pre∣tensions,
and readily admit them into the catalogue of
laudable qualities. We are not sensible, that, by
this concession, we have paved the way for all the
<PB N="131" REF="132"/>
other moral excellencies, and cannot consistently hesi∣tate
any longer, with regard to disinterested benevo∣lence,
patriotism, and humanity.</P>
<P>IT seems, indeed, certain, that first appearances
are here, as usual, extremely deceitful, and that 'tis
more difficult, in a speculative way, to resolve into
self-love, the merit which we ascribe to the selfish
virtues above-mentioned, than that even of the social
virtues, justice and beneficence. For this latter pur∣pose
we need but say, that whatever conduct pro∣motes
the good of the community, is loved, praised,
and esteemed by the community, on account of that
utility and interest, of which every one partakes:
And though this affection and regard be, in reality,
gratitude, not self-love, yet a distinction, even of this
obvious nature, may not readily be made by superfi∣cial
reasoners; and there is room, at least, to sup∣port
the cavil and dispute for a moment. But as qua∣lities,
which tend only to the utility of their possessor,
without any reference to us, or to the community, are
yet esteemed and valued; by what theory or system
can we account for this sentiment from self-love, or
deduce it from that favourite origin? There seems
here a necessity of confessing that the happiness and
misery of others are not spectacles entirely indifferent
to us; but that the view of the former, whether in its
causes or effects, like sun-shine or the prospect of well-cultivated
plains, (to carry our pretensions no higher)
<PB N="132" REF="133"/>
communicates a secret joy and satisfaction; the ap∣peareance
of the latter, like a lowering cloud or bar∣ren
landskip, throws a melancholy damp over the
imagination. And this concession being once made, the
difficulty is over; and a natural, unforced interpreta∣tion
of the phaenomena of human life will afterwards,
we may hope, prevail among all speculative en∣quirers.</P>

<P>IT may not be improper, in this place, to examine
the influence of bodily endowments, and of the goods
of fortune, over our sentiments of regard and esteem,
and to consider whether these phaenomena fortify or
weaken the present theory. It will naturally be ex∣pected,
that the beauty of the body, as is supposed by
all antient moralists, will be similar in some respects
to that of the mind; and that every kind of esteem,
which is paid to men, will have something similar in
its origin.</P>
<P>'TIS evident, that one considerable source of <HI>beauty</HI>
in all animals is the advantage which they reap from
the particular structure of their limbs and members,
suitable to the particular manner of life, to which
they are by nature destined. The just proportions of
a horse described by XENOPHON and VIRGIL, are the
same, which are received at this day by our modern
<PB N="133" REF="134"/>
jockeys; because the foundation of them is the same,
to wit, experience of what is detrimental or useful in
the animal.</P>
<P>BROAD shoulders, a lank belly, firm joints, taper
legs, all these are beautiful in our species, because
signs of force and vigour. Ideas of utility and its
contrary, though they do not entirely determine what
is handsome or deformed, are evidently the source of a
considerable part of approbation or dislike.</P>
<P>IN ancient times, bodily strength and dexterity, be∣ing
of greater <HI>use</HI> and importance in war, was also
much more esteemed and valued, than at present.
Not to insist on HOMER and the poets, we may ob∣serve,
that historians scruple not to mention <HI>force of
body</HI> among the other accomplishments even of EPA∣MINONDAS,
whom they acknowledge to be the
greatest hero, statesman, and general of all the
GREEKS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIODORUS SICULUS, lib. 15. It may not be improper to give the character of EPAMINONDAS, as drawn by the histo∣rian, in order to show the ideas of perfect merit, which pre∣vailed in those ages. In other illustrious men, says he, you will observe, that each possessed some one shining quality, which was the foundation of his fame: In EPAMINONDAS all the <HI>virtues</HI> are found united; force of body, eloquence of expression, vigour of mind, contempt of riches, gentleness of disposition, and <HI>what is chiefly to be regarded,</HI> courage and conduct in war.</NOTE>. A like praise is given to POMPEY, one
<PB N="134" REF="135"/>
of the greatest of the ROMANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cam alacribus, saltu; cum velocibus, cursu; cum validis recte certabat. <HI>SALLUST apud VEGET.</HI></NOTE>. This instance is

Of which the reason is very obvious, according to the
present theory.</P>
<P>THERE is no rule in painting or statuary more in∣dispensible
than that of ballancing the figures, and
placing them with the greatest exactness on their pro∣per
center of gravity. A figure, which is not justly
ballanced is ugly; because it conveys the disagreeable
ideas of fall, harm and pain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">All men are equally liable to pain and disease and sickness; and may again recover health and ease.

They would have more success, if the common bent of our thoughts were not perpetually turned to compare ourselves with each other. The infirmities of old age are mortifying; because a comparison with the young may take place. The king's evil is industriously concealed, because it affects others, and is transmitted to posterity. The case is nearly the same with such diseases as convey any nauseous or frightful images; the epilepsy, for instance, ulcers, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ores, scabs, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="136"/>
A DISPOSITION on turn of mind, which qualifies a
man to rise in the world, and advance his fortune, is
entitled to esteem and regard, as has been already ex∣plained.
It may, therefore, naturally be supposed,
that the actual possession of riches and authority will
have a considerable influence over these sentiments.</P>
<P>LET us examine any hypothesis, by which we can
account for the regard paid the rich and powerful:
We shall find none satisfactory but that which derives
it from the enjoyment, communicated to the spectator
by the images of prosperity, happiness, ease, plenty,
command, and the gratification of every appetite.
Self-love, for instance, which some affect so much to
consider as the source of every sentiment, is plainly in∣sufficient
to this purpose. Where no good-will or
friendship appears, 'tis difficult to conceive on what
we can found our hope of advantage from the riches
of others; though we naturally respect the rich, even
<PB N="136" REF="137"/>
before they discover any such favourable disposition
towards us.</P>
<P>We are affected with the same sentiments, when we
lie so much out of the sphere of their activity, that
they cannot even be supposed to possess the power of
serving us. A prisoner of war, in all civilized na∣tions,
is treated with a regard suited to his condition;
and riches, 'tis evident, go far towards fixing the
condition of any person. If birth and quality enter
for a share, this still affords us an argument to our
present purpose. For what is it we call a man of
birth, but one, who is descended from a long succes∣sion
of rich and powerful ancestors, and who acquires
our esteem by his connexion with persons, whom we
esteem? His ancestors, therefore, though dead, are
respected, in some measure, on account of their
riches; and consequently, without any kind of expec∣tation.</P>
<P>BUT not to go so far as prisoners of war or the
dead, to find instances of this disinterested regard for
riches; we may only observe, with a little attention,
those phaenomena, which occur in common life and
conversation. A man, who is himself, we shall sup∣pose,
of a competent fortune, and of no profession,
being introduced to a company of strangers, natural∣ly
treats them with different degrees of respect, as he
is informed of their different fortunes and conditions;
<PB N="137" REF="138"/>
though 'tis impossible that he can so suddenly propose,
and perhaps he would not accept of, any pecuniary
advantage from them. A traveller is always admitted
into company, and meets with civility, in proportion
as his train and equipage speak him a man of great or
moderate fortune. In short, the different ranks of
men are, in a great measure, regulated by riches;
and that with regard to superiors as well as inferiors,
strangers as well as acquaintance.</P>
<P>WHAT remains, therefore, but to conclude, that
as riches are desired for ourself only as the means of
gratifying our appetites, either at present or in some
imaginary future period; they beget esteem in others
merely from their having that influence. This indeed
is their very nature or essence: They have a direct
reference to the commodities, conveniencies, and
pleasures of life: The bill of a banker, who is broke,
or gold in a desert island, would otherwise be full as
valuable. When we approach a man, who is, as we
say, at his ease, we are presented with the pleasing
ideas of plenty, satisfaction, cleanliness, warmth; a
chearful house, elegant furniture, ready service, and
whatever is desirable in meat, drink, or apparel. On
the contrary, when a poor man appears, the disagree∣able
images of want, penury, hard labour, dirty fur∣niture,
coarse or ragged cloaths, nauseous meat and
distasteful liquor, immediately strike our fancy. What
else do we mean by saying that one is rich, the other
<PB N="138" REF="139"/>
poor? And as regard or contempt is the natural con∣sequence
of these different situations in life; 'tis
easily seen what additional light and evidence this
throws on our preceding theory, with regard to all
moral distinctions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is something extraordinary, and seemingly unac∣countable in the operation of our passions, when we consider the fortune and situation of others. Very often another's ad∣vancement and prosperity produces envy, which has a strong mixture of hatred, and arises chiefly from the comparison of cu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>selves with the person. At the very same time, or at least, in very short intervals, we may feel the passion of respect, which is a species of affection or good will, with a mixture of humili∣ty. On the other hand, the misfortunes of our fellows often cause pity, which has in it a strong mixture of good-will. This sentiment of pity is nearly allied to contempt, which is a species of dislike, with a mixture of pride. I only point out these phaenomena, as a subject of speculation to such as are curious with regard to moral enquiries. 'Tis sufficient for the present purpose to observe in general, that power and riches commonly cause respect, poverty and meanness contempt, tho' particular views and incidents may sometimes raise the passions of envy and of pity.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A MAN, who has cured himself of all ridiculous
prepossessions, and is fully, sincerely, and steadily
convinced, from experience as well as philosophy,
that the differences of fortune make less difference in
happiness than is vulgarly imagined; such a one does
not measure out degrees of esteem according to the
<PB N="139" REF="140"/>
rent-rolls of his acquaintance. He may, indeed, exter∣nally
pay a superior deference to the great lord above
the vassal; because riches are the most convenient,
being the most fixed and determinate, source of di∣stinction:
But his internal sentiments are more regu∣lated
by the personal characters of men, than by the
accidental and capricious favours of fortune.</P>
<P>IN most countries of EUROPE, family, that is, he∣reditary
riches, marked with titles and symbols from
the sovereign, is the chief source of distinction. In ENG∣LAND,
more regard is paid to present opulence and
plenty. Each practice has its advantages and disad∣vantages.
Where birth is respected, unactive spirit∣less
minds remain in haughty indolence, and dream
of nothing but pedigrees and genealogies: The gene∣lous
and ambitious seek honour and command and
reputation and favour. Where riches are the chief idol'
corruption, venality, rapine prevail: Arts, manufac∣tures,
commerce, agriculture, flourish. The former
prejudice, being favourable to military virtue, is more
suited to monarchies. The latter, being the chief
spur to industry, agrees better with a republican go∣vernment.
And we accordingly find. that each of
these forms of government, by varying the <HI>utility</HI> of
those customs, has commonly a proportional effect on
the sentiments of mankind.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE to OURSELVES.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER has passed an evening with serious
melancholy people, and has observed how
suddenly the conversation was animated, and what
sprightliness diffused itself over the countenance, dis∣course,
and behaviour of the whole circle, on the
accession of a good-humoured, lively companion;
such a one will easily allow, that CHEARLULNESS
carries great merit with it, and naturally conciliates
the good-will of mankind. No quality, indeed,
more readily communicates itself to all around; be∣cause
no one has a greater propensity to display itself,
in jovial talk and pleasant entertainment. The flame
spreads thro' the whole circle; and the most sullen
and morose are often caught by it. That the melan∣choly
hate the merry, even tho' HORACE says it, I
have some difficulty to allow; because I have always
observed, that where the jollity is moderate and de∣cent,
serious people are so much the more delighted,
that it dissipates the gloom, with which they are com∣monly
<PB N="142" REF="142"/>
oppressed; and gives them an unufual en∣joyment.</P>
<P>FROM this influence of cheerfulness, both to com∣municate
itself, and to engage approbation, we many
perceive, that there are another set of mental qualities,
which, without any utility or any tendency to farther
good, either of the community or of the possessor,
diffuse a satisfaction on the beholders, and procure
friendship and regard. Their immediate sensation,
to the person possessed of them, is agreeable: Others
enter into the same humour, and catch the sentiment,
by a contagion or natural sympathy: And as we can∣not
forbear loving whatever pleases, a kindly emotion
arises towards the person, who communicates so much
satisfaction. He is a more animating spectacle: His
presence diffuses over us more serene complacency
and enjoyment: Our imagination, entering into his
feelings and disposition, is affected in a more agree∣able
manner, than if a melancholy, dejected, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ullen,
anxious temper, were presented to us. Hence the
affection and approbation, which attend the former:

dignity of character, or a proper sense of what is due
to one's self, in society and the common intercourse
of life. This vice constitutes what we properly call
<HI>meanness;</HI> when a man can submit to the basest
slavery, in order to gain his ends; fawn upon those,
who abuse him; and degrade himself by intimacies
and familiarities with undeserving inferiors. A cer∣tain

degree of generous pride or self-value is so re∣quisite,
that the absence of it in the mind displeases
after the same manner, as the want of a nose, eye,
or any of the most material features of the face or
members of the body<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The absence of a virtue may often be a vice; and that of the highest kind; as in the instance of ingratitude, as well as meanness.

Where a man has no sense of value in himself, we are not likely to have any higher estimate of him. And if the same person, who crouches to his superiors, is insolent to his inferiors (as often happens) this contrariety of behaviour, instead of correcting the former vice, aggravates it extremely, <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the addition of a vice, still more odious.

<P>THE utility of COURAGE, both to the public

lustre, which it derives wholly from itself, and
from that noble elevation inseparable from it. Its
figure, drawn by painters and by poets, displays, in
each feature, a sublimity and daring considence;

pertinacious love of liberty, with which he had in∣spired
the ATHENIANS. “I beheld PHILIP,” says

while in pursuit of empire and dominion, exposing
himself to every wound; his eye goared, his neck

<P>THE martial temper of the ROMANS, inflamed by
continual wars, had raised their esteem of courage so
high, that, in their language, it was called <HI>virtue,</HI>
by way of excellence and of distinction from all other
moral qualities. <HI>The</HI> SUEVI, in the opinion of TA∣CITUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De moribus Germ.</NOTE>,

for the purposes of loving or being beloved: They adorned
themselves only for their enemies, and in order to appear
more terrible.</HI> A sentiment of the historian, which
would sound a little oddly, in other nations and
other ages.</P>
<P>THE SCYTHIANS, according to HERODOTUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE>,
after fleaing the skin from the heads of their enemies,
whom they had slain, dressed it like leather, and used
it as a towel; and whoever had the most of these
towels was most esteemed among them. So much had
martial bravery, in that nation, as well as in many
others, destroyed the sentiments of humanity; a vir∣tue
surely much more useful and engaging.</P>
<P>'TIS indeed observable, that, among all unculti∣vated
nations, who have not, as yet, had full expe∣rience
of the advantages attending beneficence, jus∣tice,
and the social virtues, courage is the predomi∣nant
excellence; what is most celebrated by poets,
recommended by parents and instructors, and admired
by the public in general. The ethics of HOMER are,
in this particular, very different from those of FENE∣LON,
his elegant imitator; and such as are well suited
to an age, in which one hero, as remarked by THU∣CYDIDES<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1.</NOTE>,
<PB N="150" REF="150"/>
could ask another, without offence, whe∣ther
or not he was a robber. Such also, very lately,
was the system of ethics, which prevailed in many
barbarous parts of IRELAND; if we many credit
SPENCER, in his judicious account of the state of
that kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is a common use, says he, amongst their gentlemen's sons, that, as soon as they are able to use their weapons, they strait gather to themselves three or four stragglers or kern, with whom wandering a while up and down idly the country, tak∣ing only meat, he at last falleth into some bad occasion, that shall be offered; which being once made known, he is thence∣forth counted a man of worth, in whom there is courage.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OF the same class of virtues with courage is that
undisturbed, philosophical TRANQUILLITY, supe∣rior
to pain, sorrow, anxiety, and each assault of
adverse fortune. Conscious of his own virtue, say
the philosophers, the sage elevates himself above
every accident of life; and securely placed in the
temple of wisdom, looks down on inferior mortals,
engaged in pursuit of honours, riches, reputation,
and each frivolous enjoyment. `These pretensions,
no doubt, when stretched to the utmost, are far too
magnificent for human nature. They carry, however,
a grandeur, with them, which seizes the spectator,
<PB N="151" REF="151"/>
and strikes him with admiration. And the nearer
we can approach, in practice, to this sublime tran∣quillity
and indifference (for we must distinguish it
from a stupid insensibility) the more secure enjoyment
shall we attain within ourselves, and the more great∣ness
of mind shall we discover to the world. The
philosophical tranquillity may, indeed, be considered
only as a branch of mag<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>animity.</P>
<P>WHO admires not SOCRATES; his perpetual sere∣nity
and contentment, amidst the greatest poverty and
domestic vexations; his resolute contempt of riches,
and magnanimous care of preserving liberty, while he
refused all assistance from his friends and disciples,
and avoided even the dependence of an obligation?
EPICTETUS had not so much as a door to his little
house or hovel; and therefore, soon lost his iron lamp'
the only furniture which he had worth taking. But
resolving to disappoint all robbers for the future, he
fupplied its place with an earthen lamp, of which
he very peaceably kept possession ever after.</P>
<P>IN antiquity, the heroes of philosophy, as well as
those of war and patriotism, have a grandeur and
force of sentiment, which astonishes our narrow souls,
and is rashly rejected as extravagant and supernatural.
They, in their turn, I allow, would have had equal
reason to consider as romantic and increadible, the de∣gree
<PB N="152" REF="152"/>
of humanity, clemency, order, tranquillity, and
other social virtues, to which, in the administration
of government, we have attained in modern times,
had any one been then able to have made a fair re∣presentation
of them. Such is the compensation,
which nature, or rather education, has made in the
distribution of excellencies and virtues, in these dif∣ferent
ages.</P>
<P>THE merit of BENEVOLENCE, arising from its
utility, and its tendency to promote the good of man∣kind,
has been already explained, and is, no doubt,
the source of a <HI>considerable</HI> part of that esteem, which
is so universally paid it. But it will also be allowed,
that the very softness and tenderness of the sentiment,
its engaging endearments, its fond expressions, its
delicate attentions; and all that flow of mutual con∣sidence
and regard, which enter into a warm attach∣ment
of love and friendship: It will be allowed, I
say, that these feelings, being delightful in them∣selves,
are necessarily communicated to the spectators,
and melt them into the same foundness and delicacy.
The tears naturally start in our eyes on the appre∣hension
of a warm sentiment of this nature: Our
breast heaves, our heart is agitated, and every hu∣mane
tender principle of our frame, is set in motion,
and gives us the purest and most satisfactory enjoy∣ment.</P>
<P><PB N="153" REF="153"/>
WHEN poets form descriptions of ELYZIAN fields,
where the blessed inhabitants stand in no need of each
other's assistance, they yet represent them as maintain∣ing
a constant intercourse of love and friendship, and
sooth our fancy with the pleasing image of these soft
and gentle passions. The idea of tender tranquillity
in a pastoral ARCADIA is agreeable from a like prin∣ciple,
as has been observed above<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect, 5. Part 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHO would live amidst perpetual wrangling, and
scolding, and mutual reproaches? The roughness
and harshness of these emotions disturb and displease
us: We suffer by contagion and sympathy; nor can
we remain indifferent spectators, even tho' certain,
that no pernicious consequences would ever follow
from such angry passions.</P>
<P>As a certain proof, that the whole merit of bene∣volence
is not derived from its usefulness, we may
observe, that, in a kind way of blame, we say, a
person is <HI>too good;</HI> when he exceeds his part in so∣ciety,
and carries his attention for others beyond the
proper bounds. In like manner, we say a man is
<HI>too high-spirited, too intrepid, too indifferent about
fortune:</HI> Reproaches, which really, at the bottom,
imply more esteem than many panegyrics. Being
<PB N="154" REF="154"/>
accustomed to rate the merit and demerit of charac∣ters
chiefly by their useful or pernicious tendencies,
we cannot forbear applying the epithet of blame,
when we discover a sentiment, which rises to a de∣gree
that is hurtful: But it may happen, at the same
time, that its noble elevation, or its engaging ten∣derness
so seizes the heart, as rather to encrease our
friendship and concern for the person<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cheerfulness could scarce admit of blame from its excess, were it not that dissolute mirth, without a proper cause or sub∣ject, is a sure symptom and characteristic of folly, and on that account, disgustful.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE amours and attachments of HARRY the IVth,
during the civil wars of the league, frequently hurt
his interest and his cause; but all the young, at least,

will readily call it such) chiefly endears that hero,
and interests them in his fortunes.</P>
<P>THE excessive bravery and resolute inflexibility of
CHARLES the XIIth ruined his own country, and
infested all his neighbours: But have such splendor

admiration; and they might, in some degree, be
even approved of, if they betrayed not sometimes too
evident symptoms of madness and disorder.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="155"/>
THE ATHENIANS pretended to the first invention
of agriculture and of laws; and always valued them∣selves
extremely on the benefit thereby procured to
the whole race of mankind. They also boasted, and
with reason, of their warlike enterprizes; particularly
against those innumerable fleets and armies of PER∣SIANS,
which invaded GREECE during the reign of
DARIUS and XERXES. But tho' there be no compa∣rison,
in point of utility, between these peaceful and
military honours; yet we find, that the orators, who
have wrote such elaborate panegyrics on that famous
city, have chiefly triumphed in displaying the warlike
atchievements. LYSIAS, THUCYDIDES, PLATO
and ISOCRATES discover, all of them, the same par∣tiality;
which, tho' condemned by calm reason and
reflection, appears so natural in the mind of man.</P>
<P>'TIS observable, that the great charm of poetry
consists in lively pictures of the sublime passions, mag∣nanimity,
courage, disdain of fortune; or those of
the tender affections, love and friendship; which warm
the heart, and diffuse over it similar sentiments and
emotions. And tho' every kind of passion, even the
most disagreeable, such as grief and anger, are ob∣served,
when excited by poetry, to convey a satisfac∣tion,
from a mechanism of nature, not easy to be ex∣plained:
Yet those more elevated or softer affections
<PB N="156" REF="156"/>
have a peculiar influence, and please from more than
one cause or principle. Not to mention, that they
alone interest us in the fortune of the persons repre∣sented,
or communicate any esteem and affection for
their character.</P>
<P>AND can it possibly be doubted, that this talent it∣self
of poets, to move the passions, this PATHETIC
and SUBLIME of sentiment, is a very considerable
merit, and being enhanced by its extreme rarity, may
exalt the person possessed of it, above every character
of the age, in which he lives? The prudence, ad∣dress,
steadiness, and benign government of AUGUS∣TUS,
adorned with all the splendor of his noble
birth and imperial crown, render him but an unequal
competitor for fame with VIRGIL, who lays nothing
into the opposite scale but the divine beauties of his
poetical genius.</P>
<P>THE very sensibility to these beauties or a DELI∣CACY
of taste, is itself a beauty in any character;
as conveying the purest, the most durable, and most
innocent of all enjoyments.</P>
<P>THESE are some instances of the species of merit,
that are valued for the immediate pleasure, which
they communicate to the person, possessed of them.
<PB N="157" REF="157"/>
No views of utility or of future beneficial conse∣quences
enter into this sentiment of approbation;
yet is it of a kind similar to that other sentiment,
which arises from views of a public or private utility.
The same social sympathy, we may observe, or fel∣low-feeling
with human happiness or misery, gives
rise to both; and this analogy in all the parts of the
present theory, may justly be regarded as a confir∣mation
of it.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of QUALITIES IMMEDIATELY AGREEABLE to
OTHERS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">'Tis the definition of virtue, that 'tis <HI>a quality of the mind agreeable to or approved of by every one, who considers or contem∣plates it.</HI> But some qualities produce pleasure, because they are useful to society, or useful or agreeable to the person himself; others produce it more immediately: Which is the class of vir∣tues here considered.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mutual shocks, in <HI>society,</HI> and the opposi∣tions
of interest and self-love have constrained
mankind to establish the laws of <HI>justice;</HI> in order to
preserve the advantages of common assistance and pro∣tection:
In like manner, the eternal contrarieties, in
<HI>company,</HI> of men's pride and self-conceit, have intro∣duced
the rules of GOOD-MANNERS or POLITE∣NESS;
in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds,
and an undisturbed commerce and conversation. A∣mong
well-bred people, a mutual deference is af∣fected:
Contempt of others disguised: Authority con∣cealed:
<PB N="160" REF="159"/>
Attention given to each in his turn: And an
easy stream of conversation maintained, without ve∣hemence,
without mutual interruption, without eager∣ness
for victory, and without any airs of superiority.
These attentions and regards are immediately <HI>agree∣able</HI>
to others, abstracted from any consideration▪ of
utility or beneficial tendencies: They conciliate af∣fection,
promote esteem, and enhance extremely the
merit of the person, who regulates his behaviour by
them.</P>
<P>MANY of the forms of breeding are arbitrary and
casual: But the thing expressed by them is still the
same. A SPAN<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ARD goes out of his own house be∣fore
his guest, to signify that he leaves him master of
all. In other countries, the landlord walks out last,
as a common mark of deference and regard.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to render a man perfect <HI>good company,</HI>
he must have WIT and INGENUITY as well as
good-manners. What wit is, it may not be easy to
define: but 'tis easy surely to determine, that 'tis a
quality immediately <HI>agreeable</HI> to others, and commu∣nicating,
on its first appearance, a lively joy and sa∣tisfaction
to every one, who has any comprehension of
it. The most prosound metaphysics, indeed, might
be employed, in explaining the various kinds and
species of wit; and many classes of it, which are now
received on the sole testimony of taste and sentiment,
<PB N="161" REF="160"/>
might, perhaps, be resolved into more general prin∣ciples.
But this is sufficient for our present purpose,
that it does affect taste and sentiment, and bestowing
an immediate enjoyment, is a sure source of appro∣bation
and affection.</P>
<P>IN countries, where man pass most of their time
in conversation, and visits and assemblies, these <HI>compa∣nionable</HI>
qualities, so to speak, are of high estimation,
and form a chief part of personal merit. In coun∣tries,
where men live a more domestic life, and either
are employed in business or amuse themselves in a
narrower circle of acquaintance, the more solid qua∣lities
are chiefly regarded. Thus, I have often ob∣served,
that, among the FRENCH, the first questions,
with regard to a stranger, are, <HI>Is he polite? Has he
wit?</HI> In our own country, the chief praise bestowed,
is always that of a <HI>good-natured, sensible fellow.</HI></P>
<P>IN conversation, the lively spirit of dialogue is
<HI>agreeable,</HI> even to those who desire not to have any
share of the discourse: Hence the teller of long sto∣ries,
or a pompous declaimer is very little approved
of. But most men desire likewise their turn in the
conversation, and regard, with a very evil eye, that
<HI>loquacity,</HI> which deprives them of a right they are na∣turally
so jealous of.</P>
<P>THERE are a set of harmless <HI>liars,</HI> frequently to
be met with in company, who deal much in the mar∣velous.
<PB N="162" REF="161"/>
Their usual intention is to please and enter∣tain;
but as men are most delighted with what they
conceive to be truth, these people mistake extremely
the means of plea<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing, and incur universal blame.
Some indulgence, however, to lying or fiction is given
in <HI>humorous</HI> stories; because it is there really agree∣able
and entertaining; and truth is not of any im∣portance.</P>
<P>ELOQUENCE, genius of all kinds, even good sense,
and sound reasoning, when it rises to an eminent de∣gree,
and is employed upon subjects of any considerable
dignity and nice discernment; all these qualities seem
immediately agreeable, and have a merit distinct from
their usefulness. Rarity, likewise, which so much
enhances the price of every thing, must set an addi∣tional
value on these noble talents of the human
mind.</P>
<P>MODESTY may be understood in different senses,
even abstracted from chastity, which has been already
treated of. It sometimes means that tenderness and
nicety of honour, that apprehension of blame, that
dread of intrusion or injury towards others, that PU∣DOR,
which is the proper guardian of every kind of
virtue, and a sure preservative against vice and cor∣ruption.
But its most usual meaning is when it is
opposed to <HI>impudence</HI> and <HI>arrogance,</HI> and expresses a
diffidence of our own judgment, and a due attention
<PB N="163" REF="162"/>
and regard to others. In young men chiefly, this
quality is a sure sign of good sense; and is also the
certain means of augmenting that endowment, by
preserving their ears open to instruction, and making
them still grasp after new attainments. But it has a
farther charm to every spectator; by flattering each
man's vanity, and presenting the appearance of a do∣cile
pupil, who receives, with proper attention and
respect, every word they utter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Men have in general a much greater propensity to over-value than under-value themselves; notwithstanding the opi∣nion of ARISTOTLE. This makes us more jealous of the ex∣cess on the former side, and causes us to regard, with a parti∣cular indulgence, all tendency to modesty and self-diffidence; as esteeming the danger less of falling into any vicious extreme of that nature. 'Tis thus, in countries, where men's bodies are apt to exceed in corpulency, personal beauty is placed in a much greater degree of <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lenderness, than in countries where that is the most usual defect. Being so often struck with instances of one species of deformity, men think they can never keep at too great a distance from it, and wish always to have a leaning to the opposite side. In like manner, were the door opened to self-praise, and were MONTAIGNE's maxim observed, that one should say as frankly, <HI>I have sense, I have learning, I have cou∣rage, beauty, or wit;</HI> as 'tis sure we often think so; were this the case, I say, every one is sensible, that such a flood of im∣pertinence would break in upon us, as would render society wholly intolerable. For this reason custom has established it as a rule, in common societies, that men should not indulge them∣selves in self-praise, nor even speak much of themselves; and 'tis only among intimate friends or people of very manly behaviour, that one is allowed to do himself justice. No body finds fault with MAURICE, prince of ORANGE, for his reply to one, who asked him whom he esteemed the first general of the age, <HI>The marquis de</HI> SPINOLA, said he, <HI>is the second.</HI> Tho' 'tis observ∣able, that the self-praise implied is here better implied, than if it had been directly expressed, without any cover or disguise.</P>
<P>He must be a very superficial thinker, who imagines, that all instances of mutual deference are to be understood in earnest, and that a man would be more esteemable for being ignorant of his own merits and accomplishments. A small byass towards modesty, even in the internal sentiments, is favourably regarded, especially in young people; and a strong byass is required in the outward behaviour: But this excludes not a noble pride and spirit, which may openly display itself in its full extent, when one lies under calumny or oppression of any kind. The generous contumacy of SOCRATES, as CICERO calls it, has been highly celebrated in all ages; and when joined to the usual modesty of his behaviour, forms a most shining character. IPHICRATES, the ATHENIAN general, being accused of betraying the interests of his country, asked his accuser, <HI>Would you,</HI> says he, <HI>on a like occasion, have been guilty of that crime? By no means,</HI> replied the other. <HI>And can you then imagine,</HI> cried the hero, <HI>that</HI> IPHJCRA∣TES <HI>would be guilty?</HI> QUINCTIL. lib. 5. cap. 12. In short, a generous spirit and self-value, well <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ounded, decently disguised, and courageously supported under distress and calumny, is a very great virtue, and seems to derive its merit from the noble eleva∣tion of its sentiment, or its immediate agreeableness to its pos∣sessor. In ordinary characters, we approve of a byass towards modesty, which is a quality immediately agreeable to others: The vicious excess of the former virtue, viz. insolence or haugh∣tiness, is immediately disagreeable to others: The excess of the latter is so to the possessor. Thus are the boundaries of these duties adjusted.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="164" REF="163"/>
A DESIRE of same, reputation, or a character with
others, is so far from being blameable, that it seems
<PB N="165" REF="164"/>
inseparable from virtue, genius, capacity, and a ge∣nerous
or noble disposition. An attention even to
trivial matters, in order to please, is also expected and
demanded by society; and no one is surprized, if he
finds a man in company, to observe a greater elegance
of dress and more pleasant flow of conversation, than
when he passes his time at home, and with his own
family. Wherein, then, consists VANITY, which
is so justly regarded as a fault or imperfection? It
seems to consist chiefly in such an intemperate display
of our advantages, honours and accomplishments; in
such an importunate and open demand of praise and
admiration, as is offensive to others, and encroaches
too far on <HI>their</HI> secret vanity and ambition. It is be∣sides
a sure symptom of the want of true dignity and
elevation of mind, which is so great an ornament to
any character. For why that impatient desire of ap∣plause;
as if you were not justly entitled to it, and
<PB N="166" REF="165"/>
might not reasonably expect that it would for ever
attend you? Why so anxious to inform us of the
great company which you have kept; the obliging
things, which were said to you; the honours, the
distinctions which you met with; as if these were
not things of course, and what we could readily, of
ourselves, have imagined, without being told of
them?</P>
<P>DECENCY, or a proper regard to age, sex, cha∣racter
and station in the world, may be ranked among
the qualities, which are immediately agreeable to
others, and which, by that means, acquire praise and
approbation. An effeminate behaviour in a man, a
rough manner in a woman; these are ugly, because
unsuitable to each character, and different from the
qualities which we expect in the sexes. 'Tis as if a
tragedy abounded in comic beauties, or a comedy in
tragic. The disproportions hurt the eye, and convey
a dsagreeable sentiment to the spectators, the source
of blame and disapprobation. This is that <HI>indecorum,</HI>
which is explained so much at large by CICERO in
his Offices.</P>
<P>AMONG the other virtues, we may also give
CLEANLINESS a place; since it naturally renders
us agreeable to others, and is no inconsiderable source
of love and affection. No one will deny, that a ne∣gligence
in this particular is a <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ault; and as faults are
<PB N="167" REF="166"/>
nothing but smaller vices, and this fault can have no
other origin than the uneasy sensation, which it ex∣cites
in others; we may, in this instance, seemingly
so trivia<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, clearly discover the origin of moral distinc∣tions,
about which the learned have involved them∣selves
in such mazes of perplexity and error.</P>
<P>BUT besides all the <HI>agreeable</HI> qualities, the origin
of whose beauty we can, in some degree, explain
and account for, there still remains something myste∣rious
and inexplicable, which conveys an immediate
satissaction to the spectator, but how, or why, or
for what reason, he cannot pretend to determine.
There is a MANNER, a grace, a genteelness, an
I-know-not-what, which some men possess above
others, which is very different from external beauty
and comeliness, and which, however, catches our af∣fection
almost as suddenly and powerfully. And tho'
this <HI>manner</HI> be chiesly talked of in the passion between
the sexes, where the concealed magic is easily ex∣plained,
yet surely much of it prevails in all our esti∣mation
of characters, and forms no inconsiderable
part of personal merit. This class of virtues, there∣fore,
must be trusted entirely to the blind, but sure
testimony of taste and sentiment; and must be con∣sidered
as a part of ethics, left by nature to baffle
all the pride of philosophy, and make her sensible of
her narrow boundaries and slender acquisitions.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="167"/>
WE approve of another, because of his wit, po∣liteness,
modesty, decency, or any agreeable quality
which he possesses; altho' he be not of our acquain∣tance,
nor has ever given us any entertainment, by
means of these accomplishments. The idea, which
we form of their effect on his acquaintance, has an
agreeable influence on our imagination, and gives us
the sentiment of approbation. This principle enters
into all the judgments, which we form concerning
morals.</P>

<P>IT may justly appear surprizing, that any man, in
so late an age, should find it requisite to prove, by
elaborate reasonings, that VIRTUE or PERSONAL
MERIT consists altogether in the possession of mental
qualities, <HI>useful</HI> or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>person himself</HI> or to
<HI>others.</HI> It might be expected that this principle
would have occured even to the first rude, unpractised
enquirers concerning morals, and been received from
its own evidence, without any argument or disputa∣tion.
Whatever is valuable in any kind, so natural∣ly
classes itself under the division of <HI>useful</HI> or <HI>agreeable,</HI>
the <HI>utile</HI> or the <HI>dulce,</HI> that 'tis not easy to imagine,
why we should ever seek farther, or consider the que∣stion
as a matter of nice research or enquiry. And as
every thing useful or agreeable must possess these
qualities with regard either to the <HI>person himself</HI> or to
<PB N="170" REF="169"/>
<HI>others,</HI> the compleat delineation or description of merit
seems to be performed as naturally as a shadow is cast
by the sun, or an image is reflected upon water. If
the ground, on which the shadow is cast, be not
broken and uneven; nor the surface, from which the
image is reflected, disturbed and confused; a just
figure is immediately presented, without any art or
attention. And it seems a reasonable presumption,
that systems and hypotheses have perverted our natu∣ral
understanding; when a theory, so simple and ob∣vious,
could so long have escaped the most elaborate
examination.</P>
<P>BUT however the case may have fared with philo∣sophy;
in common life, these principles are still im∣plicitly
maintained, nor is any other topic of praise
or blame ever recurred to, when we employ any pa∣negyric
or satyr, any applause or censure of human
action and behaviour. If we observe men, in every
intercourse of business or pleasure, in each discourse
and conversation; we shall find them no where, ex∣cept
in the schools, at any loss upon this subject.
What so natural, for instance, as the following dia∣logue?
You are very happy, we shall suppose one to
say, addressing himself to another, that you have
given your daughter to CLEANTHES. He is a man
of honour and humanity. Every one, who has
any intercourse with him, is sure of <HI>fair</HI> and <HI>kind</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="170"/>
treatment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Qualities useful to others.</NOTE>. I congratulate you too, says another,
on the promising expectations of this son-in law;
whose assiduous application to the study of the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,
whose quick penetration and early knowledge bo<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h
of men and business, prognosticate the greatest ho∣nours
and advancement<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Qualities useful to the person himself.</NOTE> You surprise me much,
replies a third, when you talk of CLEANTHES as a
man of business and application. I met him lately
in a circle of the gayest company, and he wa, the
very life and soul of our conversation: So much wit
with good manners; so much gallantry without affec∣tation;
so much ingenious knowledge so genteely de∣livered,
I have never before observed in any one<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Qualities immediately agreeable to others.</NOTE>.
You would admire him still more, says a fourth, if
you knew him more familiarly. That cheerfulness,
which you might remark in him, is not a sudden flash
struck out by company: It runs through the whole
tenor of his life, and preserves a perpetual serenity
on his countenance, and tranquillity in his soul. He
has met with severe trials, misfortunes, as well as
dangers; and by his greatness of mind, was still su∣perior
to all of them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Qualities immediately agreeable to the person himself.</NOTE> The image, gentlemen,
<PB N="172" REF="171"/>
which you have here delineated of CLEANTHES, cry
I, is that of accomplished merit. Each of you has
given a stroke of the pencil to his figure; and you
have unawares exceeded all the pictures drawn by
GRATIAN or CASTIGLIONE. A philosopher might
select this character as a model of perfect virtue.</P>
<P>AND as every quality, which is usesul or agree∣able
to ourselves or others, is, in common life, al∣lowed
to be a part of personal merit; so no other
will ever be received, where men judge of things by
their natural, unprejudiced reason, without the delu∣sive
glosses of superstition and false religion. Celi∣bacy,
fasting, penances, mortification, self-denial,
humility, silence, solitude, and the whole train of
monkish virtues; for what reason are they every
where rejected by men of sense, but because they
serve no manner of purpose; neither advance a man's
fortune in the world, nor render him a more valuable
member of society; neither qualify him for the enter∣tainment
of company, nor encrease his power of self∣enjoyment?
We observe, on the contrary, that they
cross all these desirable ends; stupify the understanding
and harden the heart, obscure the fancy and four
the temper. We justly, therefore, transfer them to
the opposite column, and place them in the catalogue
of vices; nor has any superstition force sufficient,
among men of the world, to pervert entirely these na∣tural
<PB N="173" REF="172"/>
sentiments. A gloomy, hair-brained enthusiast,
after his death, may have place in the calendar; but
will scarce ever be admitted, when alive, into intima∣cy
and society, except by those who are as delirious
and dismal as himself.</P>
<P>I<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seems a happiness in the present theory, that it
enters not into that vulgar dispute concerning the
<HI>degrees</HI> of benevolen<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or self-love, which prevail in
human nature; a dispute which is never likely to
have any issue, both because men, who have taken
party, are not easily convinced, and because the phe∣nomena,
which can be produced on either side, are
so dispersed, so uncertain, and subject to so many in∣terpretations,
that 'tis searce possible accurately to
compare them, or draw from them any determinate
inserence or conclusion. 'Tis sufficient for our pre∣sent
purpose, if it be allowed, what surely, without
the greatest absurdity, cannot be disputed, that there
is some benevolence, however small, infsued into our
bosom; some spark of friendship for human kind;
some particle of the dove, kneaded into our frame,
together with the elements of the wolf and serpent.
Let these generous sentiments be supposed ever so
weak; let them be insufficient to move even a hand
or finger of our body; they must still direct the de∣terminations
of our mind, and where every thing else
is equal, produce a cool preference of what is useful and
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erviceable to mankind, above what is pernicious and
<PB N="174" REF="173"/>
dangerous. A <HI>moral distinction,</HI> therefore, imme∣diately
arises; a general sentiment of blame and ap∣probation;
a tendency, however faint, to the objects
of the one, and a proportionable aversion to those of
the other. Nor will those reasoners, who so earnestly
maintain the predominant selfishness of human kind,
be any way scandalized at hearing of the weak senti∣ments
of virtue, implanted in our nature. On the
contrary, they are found as ready to maintain the one
tenet as the other, and their spirit of satyre (for such
it appears, rather than of corruption) naturally gives
rise to both opinions; which have, indeed, a great
and almost indiss<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>luble connection together.</P>
<P>AVARICE, ambition, vanity, and all passions, vul∣garly,
though improperly, comprized under the de∣nomination
of <HI>self-love,</HI> are here excluded from our
theory concerning the origin of morals, not because
they are too weak, but because they have not a pro∣per
direction, for that purpose. The notion of morals
implies some sentiment common to all mankind,
which recommends the same object to general appro∣bation,
and makes every man, or most men, agree in
the same opinion or decision concerning it. It also
implies some sentiment, so universal and comprehen∣sive
as to extend to all mankind, and render the ac∣tions
and conduct, even of the persons the most re∣mote,
an object of applause or censure, according as
they agree or disagree with that rule of right, which
<PB N="175" REF="174"/>
is established. These two requisite circumstances be∣long
alone to the sentiment of humanity here insisted
on. The other passions produce, in every breast,
many strong sentiments of desire and aversion, affec∣tion
and hatred; but these neither are felt so much in
common, nor are so comprchensive, as to be the
foundation of any general system and established theory
of blame or approbation.</P>
<P>WHEN a man denominates another his <HI>enemy,</HI> his
<HI>rival,</HI> his <HI>antagonist,</HI> his <HI>adversary,</HI> he is understood
to speak the lauguage of self-love, and to express sen∣timents,
peculiar to himself, and arising from his par∣ticular
cirumstances and situation. But when he be∣stows
on any man the epithets of <HI>vi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious</HI> or <HI>o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous</HI> or
<HI>deparved,</HI> he then speaks another language, and ex∣presses
sentiments, in which, he expects, all his au∣dience
are to concur with him. He must here, there∣fore,
depart from his private and particular situation,
and must choose a point of view, common to him with
others: He must move some universal principle of the
human frame, and touch a string, to which all man∣kind
have an accord and symphony. If he means,
therefore, to express, that this man possesses quali∣ties,
whose tendency is pernicious to society, he has
chosen this common point of view, and has touched
the principle of humanity, in which every man, in
some degree, concurs. While the human heart is
compounded of the same elements as at present, it
<PB N="176" REF="175"/>
will never be wholly indifferent to the good of man∣kind,
nor entirely unaffected with the tendencies of
characters and manners. And though this affection
of humanity may not generally be esteemed so strong,
as vanity or ambition, yet, being common to all
men, it can alone be the foundation of morals, or of
any general system of conduct and behaviour. One
man's ambition is not another's ambition; nor will
the fame event or object satisfy both: But the huma∣nity
of one man is the humanity of every one; and
the same object touches this passion in all human
creatures.</P>
<P>BUT the sentiments, which arise from humanity, are
not only the same in all human creatures, and produce
the same approbation or censure; but they also com∣prehend
all human creatures; nor is there any one,
whose conduct or character is not, by their means, an
object, to every one, of censure or approbation. On
the contrary, those other passions, commonly deno∣minated
selfish, both produce different sentiments in
each individual, according to his particular situation;
and also contemplate the greatest part of mankind with
the utmost indifference and unconcern. Whoever has
a high regard and esteem for me fiatters my vanity;
whoever expresses contempt mortifies and displeases
me: But as my name is known but to a small part of
mankind, there are few, who come within the sphere
of this passion, or excite, on its account, either my
<PB N="177" REF="176"/>
affection or disgust. But if you represent a tyrannical,
insolent, or barbarous behaviour, in any country
or in any age of the world; I soon carry my eye to
the pernicious tendency of such a conduct, and feel
the sentiments of repugnance and displeasure towards
it. No character can be so remote as to be, in this
light, wholly indifferent to me. What is beneficial to
society or to the person himself must still be preferred.
And every quality or action, of every human being,
must, by this means, be ranked under some class
or denomination, expressive of general censure or
applause.</P>
<P>WHAT more, therefore, can we ask to distinguish
the sentiments, dependant on humanity, from those
connected with any other passion, or to satisfy us,
why the former are the origin of morals, and not the
latter? Whatever conduct gains my approbation, by
touching my humanity, procures also the applause of
all mankind, by affecting the same principle in
them: But what serves my avarice or ambition
pleases only these passtions in me, and affects not the
avarice and ambi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the rest of mankind. No
conduct in any man, which has a benesicial tendency,
but is agreeable to my humanity, however remote
the person: But every man, so far removed as neither
to cross nor serve my avarice and ambition, is re∣garded
as wholly indifferent by those passions. The
distinction, therefore, betwixt these species of senti∣ment
<PB N="178" REF="177"/>
being so great and evident, language must soon
be moulded upon it, and must invent a peculiar set of
terms, in order to express those universal sentiments
of censure or approbation, which arise from huma∣nity,
or from views of general usefulness and its con∣trary.
VIRTUE and VICE become then known:
Morals are recognized: Certain general ideas are
framed of human conduct and behaviour: Such mea∣sures
are expected from men, in such situations:
This action is determined to be conformable to our
abstract rule; that other, contrary. And by such
universal principles are the particular sentiments of
self-love frequently controuled and limited<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It seems certain, both from reason and experience, that a rude, untaught savage regulates chiefly his love and hatred by the ideas of private utility and injury, and has but faint conceptions of a general rule or system of behaviour. The man who stands opposite to him in battle, he hates heartily, not only for the present moment, which is almost unavoidable, but for ever after; nor is he satisfied without the most extreme punishment and vengeance. But we, accustomed to society, and to more enlarged reflections, consider, that this man is serving his own country and community; that any man, in the same situation, would do the same; that we ourselves, in like circumstances, observe a like conduct; that in general human society is best supported on such, maxims: And by these suppositions and views, we correct, in some measure, our ruder and narrower passions. And though much of our friendship and enmity be still regulated by private considerations of benefit and harm, we pay, at least, this homage to general rules, which we are accustomed to re∣spect, that we commonly pervert our adversary's conduct, by imputing malice or injustice to him, in order to give vent to those passions, which arise from self-love and private interest. When the heart is full of rage, it never wants pretexts of this nature; though sometimes as frivolous, as those, from which HORACE, being almost crushed by the fall of a tree, affects to occuse of parricide the first planter of it.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="178"/>
FROM instances of popular tumults, seditions, fac∣tions,
panics, and of all passions, which are shared
with a multitude; we may learn the influence of so∣ciety,
in exciting and supporting any emotion; while
the most ungovernable disorders are raised, we find,
by that means, from the slightest and most frivolous
occasions. SOLON was no very cruel, though, per∣haps,
an unjust legislator, who punished neutrers in
civil wars; and few, I believer, would, in such cases,
incur the penalty, were their affection and discourse
allowed sufficient to absolve them. No selfishness,
and scarce any philosophy, have there force sufficient
to support a total coolness and indifference; and he
must be more or less than man, who kindles not in
the common blaze. What wonder then, that moral
sentiments are found of such influence in life; though
springing from principles, which may appear, at first
sight, somewhat small and delicate? But these princi∣ples,
we must-remark, are social and universal: They
<PB N="180" REF="179"/>
form, in a manner, the <HI>party</HI> of human-kind against
vice or disorder, its common enemy: And as the be∣nevolent
concern for others is diffused, in a greater or
less degree, over all men, and is the same in all, it
occurs more frequently in discourse, is cherished by
society and conversation, and the blame and approba∣tion,
consequent on it, are thereby rouzed from that
lethargy, into which they are probaly lulled, in soli∣tary
and uncultivated nature. Other passions, tho'
perhaps originally stronger, yet being selfish and pri∣vate,
are often overpowered by its force, and yield
the dominon of our breast to those social and public
principles.</P>
<P>ANOTHER spring of our constitution, that brings
great addition of force to moral sentiment, is, the
love of fame; which rules, with such uncontrolled
authority, in all generous minds, and is often the
grand object of all their designs and undertakings. By
our continual and earnest pursuit of a character, a
name, a reputation in the world, we bring our own
deportment and conduct frequently in review, and
consider how they appear in the eyes of those, who
approach and regard us. This constant habit of sur∣veying
ourself, as it were, in reflection, keeps
alive all the sentiments of right and wrong, and be∣gets
in noble natures, a certain reverence for them∣selves
as well as others; which is the surest guardian
of every virtue. The animal conveniencies and plea∣sures
<PB N="181" REF="180"/>
sink gradually in their value; while every in∣ward
beauty and moral grace is studiously acquired,
and the mind is accomplished in each perfection, which
can adorn or embellish a rational creature.</P>
<P>HERE is the most perfect morality with which we
are acquainted: Here is displayed the force of many
sympathies. Our moral sentiment is itself a feeling
chiefly of that nature: And our regard to a character
with others seems to arise only from a care of preserv∣ing
a character with ourselves, and to obtain this end,
we find it necessary to prop our tottering judgment on
the correspondent approbation of mankind.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to accommodate matters, and re∣move,
if possible, every difficulty, let us allow all
these reasonings to be false. Let us allow, that when
we resolve the pleasure, which arises from views of
utility, into the sentiments of humanity and sympa∣thy,
we have embraced a wrong hypothesis. Let us
consess it necessary to find some other explication of
that applause, which is paid to objects, whether in∣animate,
animate, or rational, if they have a tenden∣cy
to promote the welfare and advantage of mankind.
However difficult it be to conceive, that an object is
approved of, on account of its tendency to a certain
end, while the end itself is totally indifferent; let us
swallow this absurdity, and consider what are the con∣sequences.
The preceding delineation or definition of
<PB N="182" REF="181"/>
VIRTUE must still retain its evidence and authority:
It must still be allowed, that every quality of the
mind, which is <HI>useful</HI> or <HI>agreeable</HI> to the <HI>person himself</HI>
or to <HI>others,</HI> communicates a pleasure to the spectator,
engages his esteem, and is admitted under the honour∣able
denomination of virtue or merit. Are not justice,
fidelity, honour, veracity, allegiance, chastity, es∣teemed
solely on account of their tendency to pro∣mote
the good of society? Is not that tendency inse∣parable
from humanity, benevolence, lenity, genero∣sity,
gratitude, moderation, tenderness, friendship,
and all the other social virtues? Can it possibly be
doubted, that industry, discretion, frugality, secrecy,
order, perseverance, forethought, judgment, and the
whole class of virtues, of which many pages would
not contain the catalogue; can it be doubted, I say,
that the tendency of these virtues to promote the in∣terest
and happiness of their possessor, is the sole
foundation of their merit? Who can dispute that a
mind, which supports a perpetual serenity and cheer∣fulness,
a noble dignity and undaunted spirit, a tender
affection and good-will to all around; as it has more
enjoyment within itself, is also a more animating and
rejoicing spectacle, than if dejected with melancholy,
tormented with anxiety, irritated with rage, or sunk
into the most abject baseness and degeneracy? And
as to the qualities, immediately <HI>agreeable to others,</HI>
they speak sufficiently for themselves; and he must be
unhappy, indeed, either in his own temper, or in his
<PB N="183" REF="182"/>
situation and circumstances, who has never perceived
the charms of a facetious wit or flowing affability, of a
delicate modesty or decent genteelness of address and
manner.</P>
<P>I AM sensible, that nothing can be more unphiloso∣phical
than to be positive or dogmatical on any sub∣ject;
and that, even if <HI>excessive</HI> scepticism could be
maintained, it would not be more destructive to all
just reasoning and enquiry. I am convinced, that,
where men are the most sure and arrogant, they are
commonly the most mistaken, and have there given
reins to passion, without that proper deliberation and
suspence, which can alone secure them from the gros∣sest
absurdities. Yet I must confess, that this enume∣ration
puts the matter in so strong a light, that I can∣not,
<HI>at present,</HI> be more assured of any truth, which
I learn from reasoning and argument, than that vir∣tue
consists entirely in the usefulness or agreeableness
of qualities to the person himself possessed of them, or
to others, who have any intercourse with him. But
when I reflect, that, though the bulk and figure of the
earth have been measured and delineated, though the
motions of the tides have been accounted for, the or∣der
and oeconomy of the heavenly bodies subjected to
their proper laws, and INFINITE itself reduced to
calculation; yet men still dispute concerning the foun∣dation
of their moral duties: When I reflect on this,
I say, I fall back into diffidence and scepticism, and
<PB N="184" REF="183"/>
suspect, that an hypothesis, so obvious, had it been a
true one, would, long ere now, have been received
by the unanimous suffrage and consent of mankind.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART II.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING explained the moral <HI>approbation</HI> attending
virtue, there remains nothing, but to consider briefly
our interested <HI>obligation</HI> to it, and to enquire, whether
every man, who has any regard to his own happiness
and welfare, will not best find his account in the prac∣tice
of every moral duty. If this can be clearly as∣certained
from the foregoing theory, we shall have
the satisfaction to reflect, that we have advanced prin∣ciples,
which not only, 'tis hoped, will s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and the test
of reasoning and enquiry, but may contribute to the
amendment of men's lives, and their improvement in
morality and social virtue. And though the philoso∣phical
truth of any proposition by no means depends
on its tendency to promote the interests of society;
yet a man has but a bad grace, who delivers a theory,
however true, which, he must confess, leads to a
practice dangerous and pernicious. Why rake into
those corners of nature, which spread a nuisance all
areound? Why dig up the pestilene from the pit,
in which it is buried? The ingenuity of your resear∣ches
may be admired; but your systems will be detes∣ted:
And mankind will agree, if they cannot re∣fute
<PB N="185" REF="184"/>
them, to sink them, at least, in eternal silence
and oblivion. Truths, which are <HI>pernicious</HI> to society,
if any such there be, will yield to errors, which are
salutary and <HI>advantageous.</HI></P>
<P>BUT what philosophical truths can be more advan∣tageous
to society, than those here delivered, which
represent virtue in all her genuine and most engaging
charms, and make us approach her with ease, fami∣liarity,
and affection? The dismal dress falls off,
with which many divines, and some philosophers
had covered her; and nothing appears but gentle∣ness,
humanity, benesicence, affability; nay even,
at proper intervals, play, frolic, and gaiety. She
talks not of useless au<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terities and rigours, suffering
and self-denial. She declares, that her sole purpose
is, to make her votaries and all mankind, during
every instant of their existence, if postible, cheerful
and happy; nor does she ever willingly part with
any pleasure but in hopes of ample compensation in
some other period of their lives. The sole trouble
which she demands is that of just calculation, and a
steady preference of the greater happiness. And if any
austere pretenders approach her, enemies to joy and
pleasure, she either rejects them as hypocrites and
deceivers; or if she admits them in her train,
they are ranked, however, among the least favoured
of her votaries.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="185"/>
AND indeed, to drop all figurative expression, what
hopes can we ever have of engaging mankind to a
practice, which we confess full of austerity and rigour<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
Or what morality can ever serve any useful purpose,
unless it can show, by a particular detail, that all the
duties, which it recommends, are also the true inte∣rest
of each individual? The peculiar advantage of
the foregoing theory, seems to be, that it furnishes
proper mediums for that purpose.</P>
<P>THAT the virtues which are immediately <HI>useful</HI> or
<HI>agreeable</HI> to the person possessed of them, are desire∣able
in a view to self-interest, it would surely be su∣perfluous
to prove. Moralists indeed, may spare them∣selves
all the pains, which they often take in recom∣mending
these duties. To what purpose collect argu∣ments
to evince, that temperance is advantageous,
and the excesses of pleasure hurtful? When it appears,
that these excesses are only denominated such, because
they are hurtful; and that, if the unlimited use of strong
liquors, for instance, no more impaired health or the
faculties of the mind and body than the use of air or
water, it would not be a whit more vicious or blame∣able.</P>
<P>IT seems equally superfluous to prove, that the
<HI>companionable</HI> virtues of good manners and wit, de∣cency
and genteelness, are more desirable than the
contrary qualities. Vanity alone, without other con∣siderations,
<PB N="187" REF="186"/>
is a sufficient motive to make us wish the
possession of these accomplishments. No man was
ever willingly deficient in this particular. All our
failures here proceed from bad education, want of ca∣pacity,
or a perverse and unpliable disposition.
Would you have your company coveted, admired,
followed; rather than hated, despised, avoided? Can
any one seriously deliberate in the case? As no enjoy∣ment
is sincere, without some reference to company
and society; so no society can be agreeable or even
tolerable, where a man feels his presence unwelcome,
and discovers all around him symptoms of disgust and
aversion.</P>
<P>BUT why, in the greater society or confederacy of
mankind, should not the case be the same as in parti∣cular
clubs and companies? Why is it more doubtful,
that the enlarged virtues of humanity, generosity,
beneficence, are desirable with a view to happiness and
self-interest, than the limited endowments of ingenui∣ty
and politeness? Are we apprehensive, lest those
social affections have a greater and more immediate
interference, than any other pursuits, with private
utility, and cannot be gratified, without some impor∣tant
sacrifices of honour and advantage? If so, we are
but ill instructed in the nature of the human passions,
and are more influenced by verbal distinctions than by
real differences.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="187"/>
WHATEVER contradiction may vulgarly be sup∣posed
betwixt the <HI>selfish</HI> and <HI>social</HI> sentiments or dif∣positions,
they are really no more opposite than selfish
and ambitious, selfish and revengeful, selfish and vain.
'Tis requisite, that there be an original propensity of
some kind, in order to be a basis to self-love, by giv∣ing
a relish to the objects of its pursuit; and none
more fit for this purpose than benevolence or humani∣ty.
The goods of fortune are spent in one gratifica∣tion
or other: The miser, who accumulates his annual
income, and lends it out at interest, han really spent
it in the gratification of his avarice. And it would be
difficult to show, why a man is more a loser by a ge∣nerous
action, than by any other method of expence;
since the utmost which he can attain, by the most ela∣borte
selfishness, is the indulgence of some affection.</P>
<P>NOW if life, without passion, must be altogether in∣sipid
and tiresome; let a man suppose that he has full
power of modelling his own disposition, and let him
deliberate what appetite or desire he would choose for
the foundation of his happiness and enjoyment.
Every affection, he would observe, when gratified by
success, gives a satisfaction proportioned to its force
and violence; but besides this advantage, common to
all, the immediate feeling of benevolence and friend∣ship,
humanity and kindness, is sweet, smooth, ten∣der,
and agreeable, independent of all fortune and
accidents. These virtues are besides attended with a
<PB N="189" REF="188"/>
pleasing consciousness or remembrance, and keep us
in humour with ourselves as well as others; while we
retain the agreeable reflection of having done our part
towards mankind and society. And though all men
show a jealousy of our success in the pursuits of avarice
and ambition; yet are we almost sure of their good-will
and good-wishes, so long as we persevere in the
paths of virtue, and employ ourselves in the execution
of generous plans and purposes. What other passion
is there where we shall find so many advantages
united; an agreeable sentiment, a pleasing conscious∣ness,
a good reputation? But of these truths, we may
observe, men are, of themselves, pretty much con∣vinced;
nor are they deficient in their duty to society,
because they would not wish to be generous, friendly,
and humane; but because they do not feel themselves
such.</P>
<P>TREATING vice with the greatest candour, and
making it all possible concessions, we must acknow∣ledge,
that there is not, in any instance, the smallest
pretext for giving it the preference above virtue, with
a view to self-interest; except, perhaps, in the case of
justice, where a man, taking things in a certain light,
may often seem to be loser by his integrity. And
though it is allowed, that, without a regard to pro∣perty,
no society could subsist; yet according to the
imperfect way, in which human affairs are conducted,
a sensible knave, in particular incidents, may think,
<PB N="190" REF="189"/>
that an act of iniquity or infidelity will make a con∣siderable
addition to his fortune, without causing any
considerable breach in the social union and confedera∣cy.
That <HI>honesty is the best policy,</HI> may be a good ge∣neral
rule; but is liable to many exceptions: And he,
it may, perhaps, be judged, conducts himself with
most wisdom, who observes the general rule, and takes
advantage of all the exceptions.</P>
<P>I MUST confess, that if a man thinks, that this rea∣soning
much requires an answer, it will be a little dif∣ficult
to find any, which will to him appear stisfactory
and convincing. If his heart rebels not against such
pernicious maxims, if he feels no reluctance to the
thoughts of villainy or baseness, he has indeed lost a
considerable motive to virtue; and we may expect,
that his practice will be answerable to his speculation.
But in all ingenuous natures, the antipathy to trea∣chery
and roguery is too strong to be counterballanced
by any views of profit or pecuniary advantage. In∣ward
peace of mind, consciousne of integrity, a sa∣tisfactory
view of our own conduct; these are circum∣stances
very requisite to happiness, and will be cherish∣ed
and cultivated by every honest man, who feels the
importance of them.</P>
<P>SUCH a one has, besides, the frequent satisfaction of
seeing knaves, with all their pretended cunning and
ability, betrayed by their own maxims; and while they
<PB N="191" REF="190"/>
purpose to cheat with moderation and secrecy, a
tempting incident occurs, nature is frail, and they
give into the snare; whence they can never extricate
themselves, without a total loss of reputation, and the
forfeiture of all future trust and confidence with man∣kind.</P>
<P>BUT were they ever so secret and successful, the
honest man, if he has any tincture of philosophy, or
even common observation and reflection, will dis∣cover,
that they themselves are, in the end, the great∣est
dupes, and have sacrificed the invaluable enjoyment
of a character, with themselves at least, for the acqui∣sition
of worthless toys and gewgaws. How little is
requisite to supply the <HI>mcessities</HI> of nature? And in a
view to <HI>pleasure,</HI> what comparison between the un∣bought
satisfactions of conversation, society, study,
even health and the common beauties of nature, but
above all the peaceful reflection on one's own conduct:
What comparison, I say, between these, and the fe∣verish,
empty amusements of luxury and expence?
These natural pleasures, indeed, are really without
price; both because they are below all price in their
attainment, and above it in their enjoyment.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">CONCERNING MORAL SENTIMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IF the foregoing hypothesis be received, it will now
be easy for us to determine the question first
started<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sect. I.</NOTE>, concerning the general principles of mo∣rals;
and tho' we postponed the decision of that
question, lest it should then involve us in intricate
speculations, which are unfit for moral discourses, we
may resume it at present, and examine how far either
<HI>reason</HI> or <HI>sentiment</HI> enters into all determinations of
parise or censure.</P>
<P>THE chief foundation of moral praise being sup∣posed
to lie in the usefulness of any quality or action;
'tis evident, that <HI>reason</HI> must enter for a considerable
share in all determinations of this kind; since no∣thing
but that faculty can instruct us in the tendency
of qualities and actions, and point out their benefi∣cial
consequences to society and to their possessors.
In many cases, this is an affair liable to great contro∣versy:
<PB N="194" REF="192"/>
Doubts may arise; opposite interests occur;
and a preference must be given to one side, from very
nice views, and a small overballance of utility. This
is particularly remarkable in questions with regard to
justice; as is, indeed, natural to suppose, from that
species of utility, which attends this virtue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Appendix II.</NOTE> Were
every single instance of justice, like that of benevo∣lence,
useful to society; this would be a more simple
state of the case, and seldom liable to great contro∣versy.
But as single instances of justice are often
pernicious in their first and immediate tendency, and
as the advantage to society results only from the ob∣servance
of the general rule, and from the concurrence
and combination of several persons in the same equi∣table
conduct; the case here becomes more intricate
and involved. The various circumstances of society;
the various confequences of any practice; the various
interests, which may be proposed: These on many
occasions are doubtful, and subject to great discussion
and enquiry. The object of municipal laws is to fix
all questions with regard to justice: The debates of
civilians; the reflections of politicians; the prece∣dents
of histories and public records, are all directed
to the same purpose. And a very accurate <HI>reason</HI> or
<HI>judgment</HI> is often requisite, to give the true determi∣nation,
amidst such intricate doubts arising from ob∣scure
or opposite utilities.</P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="193"/>
BUT tho' reason, when fully assisted and improved,
be sufficient to instruct us in the pernicious or useful
tendencies of qualities and actions; it is not alone
sufficient to produce any moral blame or approbation.
Utility is only a tendency to a certain end; and were
the end totally indifferent to us, we should feel the
same indifference towards the means. 'Tis requisite a
<HI>sentiment</HI> should here display itself, in order to give a
preference to the useful above the pernicious tenden∣cies.
This sentiment can be no other than a feeling
for the happiness of mankind, and a resentment of
their misery; since these are the different ends, which
virtue and vice have a tendency to promote. Here,
therefore, <HI>reason</HI> instructs us in the several tendencies
of actions, and <HI>humanity</HI> makes a distinction in favour
of those, which are useful and beneficial.</P>
<P>THIS partition between the faculties of understand∣ing
and sentiment, in all moral decisions, seems clear
from the preceding hypothesis. But I shall suppose
that hypothesis false: It will then be requisite to look
out for some other theory, that may be satisfactory;
and I dare venture to affirm, that none such will
ever be found, so long as we suppose reason to be
the sole source of morals. To prove this, it will be
proper to weigh the five following considerations.</P>
<P>I. 'Tis easy for a false hypothesis to maintain some
appearance of truth, while it keeps wholly in gene∣rals,
<PB N="196" REF="194"/>
makes use of undefined terms, and employs
comparisons, instead of instances. This is particu∣larly
remarkable in that philosophy, which ascribes
the discernment of all moral distinctions to reason
alone, without the concurrence of sentiment. 'Tis
impossible, in any particular instance, that this hy∣pothesis
can so much as be rendered intelligible;
whatever specious figure it may make in general de∣clamations
and discourses. Examine the crime of
<HI>ingratitude,</HI> for instance; which has place, wherever
we observe good-will, expressed and known together
with good offices performed, on the one side, and a
return of ill-will or indifference, with ill-offices or
neglect on the other: Anatomize all these circum∣stances,
and examine, by your reason alone, in what
consists the demerit or blame: You never will come
to any issue or conclusion.</P>
<P>REASON judges either of <HI>matter of fact</HI> or of <HI>rela∣tions.</HI>
Enquire then, <HI>first,</HI> where is that matter of
fact, which we here call <HI>crime;</HI> point it out; deter∣mine
the time of its existence; describe its essence or
nature; explain the sense or faculty, to which it dis∣covers
itself. It resides in the mind of the person,
who is ungrateful. He must, therefore, feel it, and
be conscious of it. But nothing is there, except the
passion of ill-will or absolute indifference. You can∣not
say, that these, of themselves, always, and in all
circumstances, are crimes. No: They are only
<PB N="197" REF="195"/>
crimes, when directed towards persons, who have
before expressed and displayed good will towards us.
Confequently, we may infer, that the crime of in∣gratitude
is not any particular individual <HI>fact;</HI> but
arises from a complication of circumstances, which,
being presented to the spectator, excites the <HI>sentiment</HI>
of blame, by the particular structure and fabric of
his mind.</P>
<P>THIS representation, you say, is false. Crime,
indeed, consists not in a particular <HI>fact,</HI> of whose re∣ality
we are assured by <HI>reason:</HI> But it consists in cer∣tain
<HI>moral relations,</HI> discovered by reason, in the same
manner as we discover, by reason, the truths of ge∣ometry
or algebra. But what are the relations, I ask,
of which you here talk? In the case stated above, I
see first good will and good offices, in one person;
then ill-will and ill-offices in the other. Between
these, there is the relation of <HI>contrariety.</HI> Does the
crime consist in that relation? But suppose a person
bore me ill-will or did me ill-offices; and I, in re∣turn,
were indifferent towards him, or did him good-offices:
Here is the same relation of <HI>contraritey;</HI> and
yet my conduct is often highly laudable. Twist and
turn this matter, as much as you will, you can never
rest the morality on relation; but must have recourse
to the decisions of sentiment.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="196"/>
WHEN 'tis affirmed, that two and three are equal
to the half of ten; this relation of equality, I un∣derstand
perfectly. I conceive, that if ten be divided
into two parts, of which one has as many units as
the other; and if any of these parts be compared
to two added to three, it will contain as many units
as that compound number. But when you draw
thence a comparison to moral relations, I own, that
I am altogether at a loss to understand you. A
moral action, a crime, such as ingratitude, is a com∣plicated
object. Does the morality consist in the
relation of its parts to each other. How? After
what manner? Specify the relation: Be more parti∣cular
and explicite in your propositions; and you
will easily see their falshood.</P>
<P>NO, say you, the morality consists in the relation
of actions to the rule of right; and they are deno∣minated
good or ill, according as they agree or dis∣agree
with it. What then is this rule of right? In
what does it consist? How is it determined? By
reason, you'll say, which examines the moral relations
of actions. So that moral relations are determined
by the comparison of actions to a rule. And that
rule is determined by considering the moral relations
of objects. Is not this fine reasoning?</P>
<P>ALL this is metaphysics, you cry. That is
enough: There needs nothing more to give a strong
presumption of falshood. Yes, replied I: Here are
<PB N="199" REF="197"/>
metaphysics surely: But they are all on your side,
who advance an abstruse hypothesis, which can never
be made intelligible, nor quadrate with any parti∣cular
instance or illustration. The hypothesis which
we embrace is plain. It maintains, that morality is
determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be,
<HI>whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the
ple<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing sentiment of approbation;</HI> and vice the contrary.
We then proceed to examine a plain matter of fact, <HI>viz.</HI>
what actions have this influence: We consider all
the circumstances, in which these actions agree: And
from thence endeavour to extract some general ob∣servations
with regard to these sentiments. If you
call this metaphysics, and find any thing abstruse here,
you need only conclude, that your turn of mind is
not suited to the moral sciences.</P>
<P>II. WHEN a man, at any time, deliberates con∣cerning
his own conduct, (as, whether he had bet∣ter,
in a particular emergence, assist a brother or a
benefactor) he must consider these separate relations,
with the whole circumstances and situation of the
persons, in order to determine the superior duty and
obligations: And in order to determine the propor∣tion
of lines in any triangle, 'tis necessary to examine
the nature of that figure, and the relations, which its
several parts bear to each other. But notwithstanding
this appearing similarity in the two cases, there is, at
the bottom, an extreme difference between them,
<PB N="200" REF="198"/>
A speculative reasoner concerning triangles or circles
considers the several known and given relations of
the parts of these figures; and from thence infers
some unknown relation, which is dependent on the
former. But in moral deliberations, we must be ac∣quainted,
before-hand, with all the objects, and all
the relations to each other; and from a comparison
of the whole, fix our choice or approbation. No
new fact to be ascertained: No new relation to be
discovered. The whole circumstances of the case are
supposed to be laid before us, ere we can fix any sen∣tence
of blame or approbation. If any material
circumstance be yet unknown or doubtful, we must
first employ our enquiry or intellectual faculties to
assu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e us of it; and must suspend for a time all moral
decision or sentiment. While we are ignorant, whe∣ther
a man was aggressor or not, how can we deter∣mine
whether the person, who killed him, be crimi∣nal
or innocent? But after every circumstance, every
relation is known, the understanding has no far∣ther
room to operate, nor any object, on which it
could employ itself. The approbation or blame,
which then ensues, cannot be the work of the judg∣ment,
but of the heart; and is not a speculative pro∣position
or affirmation, but an active feeling or sen∣timent.
In the disquisitions of the understanding,
from known circumstances and relations, we infer
some new and unknown. In moral decisions, the
<PB N="201" REF="199"/>
whole circumstances and relations must be antece∣dently
known; and the mind, from the contempla∣tion
of the whole, feels some new impression of af∣fection
or disgust, esteem or contempt, approbation
or blame.</P>
<P>HENCE the great difference between a mistake of
<HI>fact</HI> and one of <HI>right;</HI> and hence the reason, why the
one is commonly criminal and not the other. When
OEDIPUS killed LAIUS, he was ignorant of the rela∣tion,
and from circumstances, innocent and involun∣tary,
formed erroneous opinions concerning the ac∣tion
which he committed. But then NERO killed
AGRIPPINA, all the relations between himself and
the person, and all the circumstances of the fact were
antecedently known to him: But the motive of re∣venge,
or fear or interest, prevailed in his savage
heart over the sentiments of duty and humanity. And
when we express that detestation against him, to
which he, himself, in a little time, became insensible;
'tis not, that we see any relations, of which he was
ignorant, but that, from the rectitude of our disposi∣tion,
we feel sentiments, against which he was har∣dened,
from flattery and a long perseverance in the
most enormous crimes. In these sentiments, then,
not a discovery of relations of any kind, do all mo∣ral
determinations consist. Before we can pretend to
form any decision of this kind, every thing must be
known and ascertained on the side of the object or
<PB N="202" REF="200"/>
action. Nothing remains but to feel, on our part,
some sentiment of blame or approbation; whence
we pronounce the action criminal or virtuous.</P>
<P>III. THIS doctrine will become still more evident,
if we compare moral beauty with natural, to which,
in many particulars, it bears so near a resemblance.
'Tis on the proportion, relation, and position of parts,
that all natural beauty depends; but it would be ab∣surd
thence to infer, that the perception of beauty,
like that of truth in geometrical problems, consists
wholly in the perception of relations, and was per∣formed
entirely by the understanding or intellectual
faculties. In all the sciences, our mind, from the
known relations, investigates the unknown: But in
all decisions of taste or external beauty, the whole re∣lations
are before hand obvious to the eye; and we
thence proceed to feel a sentiment of complacency or
disgust, according to the nature of the object, and
disposition of our organs.</P>
<P>EUCLID has fully explained all the qualities of the
circle; but has not, in any proposition, said a word
of its beauty. The reason is evident. The beauty
is not a quality of the circle. It lies not in any
part of the line, whose parts are equally distant from
a common center. It is only the effect, which that
figure operates upon the mind, whose peculiar fabric
or structure renders it susceptible of such sentiments.
<PB N="203" REF="201"/>
In vain would you look for it in the circle, or seek
it, either by your senses or by mathematical reason∣ings,
in all the properties of that figure.</P>
<P>ATTEND to PALLADIO and PERRAULT, while
they explain all the parts and proportions of a pillar:
They talk of the cornice and freeze and base and en∣tablature
and shaft and architrave; and give the de∣scription
and position of each of these members. But
should you ask the description and position of its
beauty, they would readily reply, that the beauty
is not in any of the parts or members of a pillar, but
results from the whole, when that complicated figure
is presented to an intelligent mind, susceptible of those
finer sensations. 'Till such a spectator appear, there
is nothing but a figure of such particular dimensions
and proportions: From his sentiments alone arise its
elegance and beauty.</P>
<P>AGAIN; attend to CICERO, while he paints the
crimes of a VERRES or a CATILINE; you must ac∣knowledge,
that the moral turpitude results, in the
same manner, from the contemplation of the whole,
when presented to a being, whose organs have such
a particular structure and formation. The orator may
paint rage, insolence, barbarity on the one side:
Meekness, suffarence, sorrow, innocence on the other:
But if you feel no indignation or compassion arise in
you from this complication of circumstances, you
<PB N="204" REF="202"/>
would in vain ask him, in what consists the crime or
villainy, which he so vehemently exclaims against:
At what time, or on what subject it first began to ex∣ist:
And what has a few months afterwards become
of it, when every disposition and thought of all the
actors is totally altered, or annihilated. No satisfac∣tory
answer can be given to any of these questions,
upon the abstract hypothesis of morals; and we must
at last acknowledge, that the crime or immorality is
no particular fact or relation, which can be the object
of the understanding: But arises entirely from the
sentiment of disapprobation, which, by the structure
of human nature, we unavoidably feel on the appre∣hension
of barbarity or treachery.</P>
<P>IV. INANIMATE objects may bear to each other
all the same relations, which we observe in moral
agents; tho' the former can never be the object of
love or hatred, nor are consequently susceptible of
merit or iniquity. A young tree, which over-tops
and destroys its parent, stands in all the same relations
with NERO, when he murdered AGRIPPINA; and if
morality consisted in any abstract relations, would,
no doubt, be equally criminal.</P>
<P>V. IT appears evident, that the ultimate ends of
human actions can never, in any case, be accounted
<PB N="205" REF="203"/>
for by <HI>reason,</HI> but recommend themselves entirely to
the sentiments and affections of mankind, without
any dependance on the intellectual faculties. Ask a
man, <HI>why he uses exercise;</HI> he will answer, <HI>because he
desires to keep his health.</HI> If you then enquire, <HI>why
he desires health,</HI> he will readily reply, <HI>because sikness
is painful.</HI> If you push your enquiries farther, and
desire a reason, <HI>why he hates pain,</HI> 'tis impossible he
can ever give any. This is an ultimate end, and is
never referred to any other object.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, to your second question, <HI>why he desires
health,</HI> he may also reply, that <HI>'tis requisite for the exer∣cise
of his calling.</HI> If you ask, <HI>why he is anxious on that
head,</HI> he will answer, <HI>because he desires to get money.</HI>
If you demand <HI>Why? It is the instrument of pleasure,</HI>
says he. And beyond this it is an absurdity to ask
for a reason. 'Tis impossible there can be a progress
<HI>in infinitum;</HI> and that one thing can always be a rea∣son,
why another is desired. Something must be de∣sirable
on its own account, and because of its imme∣diate
accord or agreement with human sentiment and
affection.</P>
<P>NOW as virtue is an end, and is desirable on its
own account, without see or reward, merely for the
immediate satisfaction which it conveys; 'tis requisite
<PB N="206" REF="204"/>
that there should be some sentiment, which it touches;
some internal taste or feeling, or whatever you please
to call it, which distinguishes moral good and evil,
and which embraces the one and rejects the other.</P>
<P>THUS the distinct boundaries and offices of <HI>reason</HI>
and of <HI>taste</HI> are easily ascertained. The former conveys
the knowledge of truth and falshood: The latter gives
the sentiment of beauty and deformity, vice and virtue.
The one discovers objects, as they really stand in na∣ture,
without addition or diminution: The other has a
productive faculty, and gilding or staining all natural
objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sen∣timent,
raises, in a manner, a new creation. Reason,
being cool and disengaged, is no motive to action,
and directs only the impulse received from appetite
or inclination, by showing us the means of obtaining
happiness or avoiding misery: Taste, as it gives plea∣sure
or pain, and thereby constitutes happiness or mi∣sery,
becomes a motive to action, and is the first
spring or impulse to desire and volition. From cir∣cumstances
and relations, known or supposed, the
former leads us to the discovery of the concealed and
unknown: After all circumstances and relations are
laid before us, the latter makes us feel from the
whole a new sentiment of blame or approbation.
The standard of the one, being founded on the na∣ture
<PB N="207" REF="205"/>
of things, is eternal and inflexible, even by the
will of the supreme Being: The standard of the
other, arising from the internal frame and constitution
of animals, is ultimately derived from that supreme
will, which bestowed each being its peculiar nature,
and arranged the several classes and orders of ex∣istence.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">SOME FARTHER CONSIDERATIONS with regard to
JUSTICE.</HEAD>
<P>THE intention of this appendix is to give some
more particular explication of the origin and
and nature of justice, and to mark some differences
between it and the other virtues.</P>
<P>THE social virtues of humanity and benevolence
exert their influence immediately, by a direct ten∣dency
or instinct, which keeps chiefly in view the
simple object, that moves the affections, and com∣prehends
not any scheme or system, nor the conse∣quences
resulting from the concurrence, imitation,
or example of others. A parent slies to the relief of
his child; transported by the natural sympathy,
which actuates him, and which affords no leisure to
reflect on the sentiments or conduct of the rest of
mankind in like circumstances. A generous man
embraces cheerfully an opportunity of serving his
<PB N="210" REF="207"/>
friend; because he then feels himself under the domi∣nion
of the beneficent affections, nor is he concerned
whether any other person in the universe was ever be∣fore
actuated by such noble motives, or will ever af∣terwards
prove their influence. In all these cases,
the social passions have in view a single individual
object, and pursue alone the safety or happiness of the
person, loved and esteemed. With this, they are
satisfied: In this, they acquiesce. And as the good
resulting from their benign influence, is in itself
compleat and entire, it also excites the moral senti∣ment
of approbation, without any reflection on far∣ther
consequences or more enlarged views of the
concurrence or imitation of the other members of
society. On the contrary, were the generous friend
or disinterested patriot to stand alone in the practice
of beneficence; this would rather inhance his value
in our eyes, and join the praise of rarity and novelty
to his other more exalted merits.</P>
<P>THE case is not the same with the social virtues of
justice and fidelity. They are highly useful, or in∣deed
absolutely necessary to the well-being of man∣kind:
But the benefit, resulting from them, is not
the consequence of every individual single <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>act; but
arises from the whole scheme or system, concurred in
by the whole, or the greatest part of the society.
General peace and order are the attendants of justice
or a general abstinence from the possessions of other:
<PB N="211" REF="208"/>
But a particular regard to the particular right of one in∣dividual
citizen may frequently, considered in itself, be
productive of pernicious consequences. The result of
the several acts is here often directly opposite to that of
the whole system of actions; and the former may be ex∣tremely
hurtful, while the latter is, to the highest degree,
advantageous. Riches, inherited from a parent, are, in
a bad man's hand, the instruments of mischief. The
right of succession may, in one instance, be hurtful.
Its benefit arises only from the observance of the ge∣neral
rule; and 'tis sufficient, if compensation be
thereby made for all the ills and inconveniencies,
which flow from particular characters and situations.</P>
<P>CYRUS, young and unexperienced, considered only
the individual case before him, and reflected on its
limited fitness and convenience, when he assigned the
long coat to the tall boy, and the short coat to the
other of smaller size. His governor instructed him
better; while he pointed out more enlarged views
and consequences, and informed his pupil of the ge∣neral,
inflexible rules, requisite to support general
peace and order in society.</P>
<P>THE happiness and prosperity of mankind, arising
from the social virtue of benevolence and its sub∣divisions,
may be compared to a wall, built by many
hands; which still rises by each stone, that is heaped
upon it, and receives proportional encrease to the
<PB N="212" REF="209"/>
diligence and care of each workman. The same
happiness, raised by the social virtue of justice and
its subdivisions, may be compared to the building of
a vault, where each individual stone would, of itself
fall to the ground; nor does the whole fabric support
itself, but by the mutual assistance and combination
of its corresponding parts.</P>
<P>ALL the laws of nature, which regulate property,
as well as all civil laws, are general, and regard
alone some essential circumstances of the case, with∣out
taking into consideration the characters, situa∣tions
and connexions of the person concerned, or any
particular consequences, which may result from the
determination of these laws, in every particular case
which offers. They deprive, without scruple, a be∣neficent
man of all his possessions, if acquired by
mistake, without a good title; in order to bestow them
on a selfish miser, who has already heaped up im∣mense
stores of superfluous riches. Public utility re∣quires,
that property should be regulated by general
inflexible rules; and tho' such rules are adopted as best
serve the same end of public utility, 'tis impossible
for them to prevent all particular hardships, or make
beneficial consequences result from every individual
case. 'Tis sufficient, if the whole plan or scheme be
necessary to the support of civil society, and if the
ballance of good, in the main, does thereby prepon∣derate
much above that of evil. Even the general
<PB N="213" REF="210"/>
laws of the universe, tho' planned by infinite wis∣dom,
cannot exclude all evil or inconvenience, in
every particular operation.</P>
<P>IT has been asserted by some, that justice arises
from HUMAN CONVENTIONS, and proceeds
from the voluntary choice, consent, or combination
of mankind. If by <HI>convention</HI> be here meant a <HI>pro∣mise</HI>
(which is the most usual sense of the word) no∣thing
can be more absurd, than this position. The
observance of promises is itself one of the most con∣siderable
parts of justice; and we are not surely bound
to keep our word, because we have given our word
to keep it. But if by convention be meant a sense
of common interest; which sense each man feels in
his own breast, which he observes in his fellows, and
which carries him, in concurrence with others, into
a general plan or system of actions, which tends to
public utility; it must be owned, that, in this sense,
justice arises from human conventions. For if it be
allowed (what is, indeed, evident) that the particular
consequences of a particular act of justice may be
hurtful to the public as well as to individuals; it
follows, that every man, in embracing that virtue,
must have an eye to the whole plan or system, and
must expect the concurrence of his fellows in the
same conduct and behaviour. Did all his views ter∣minate
in the particular consequences of each parti∣cular
act of his own, his benevolence and humanity,
<PB N="214" REF="211"/>
as well as his self-love, might often prescribe to him
measures of conduct very different from those, which
are agreeable to the strict rules of right and justice.</P>
<P>THUS two men pull the oars of a boat, by com∣mon
convention, for common interest, without any
promise or contract: Thus gold and silver are made
the measures of exchange; thus speech and words
and language are fixed, by human convention and
agreement. Whatever is advantageous to two or
more persons, if all perform their part; but what
loses all advantage, if only one perform, can arise
from no other principle. There would otherwise be
no motive for any one of them to enter into that scheme
of conduct<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This theory concerning the origin of property, and conse∣quently of justice, is, in the main, the same with that hinted at and adopted by GROTIUS. “Hinc discimus, quae fuerit causa, ob quam a primaeva communione rerum primo mobilium, de∣inde &amp; immobilium discessum est: nimirum quod cum non contenti homines vesci sponte natis, antra habitare, corpore aut nudo agere, aut corticibus arborum ferarumve pellibus vestito, vitae genus exquisitius delegissent, industria opus fuit, quam singuli rebus singulis adhiberent: Quo minus autem structus in commune conferrentur, primum obstitit locorum, in quae homines discesserunt, distantia, deinde justitiae &amp; amoris defectus, per quem fiebat, ut nec in labore, nec in consumtione fructu<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m quae debebat, aequalitas servaretur.

<P><PB N="215" REF="212"/>
THE word, <HI>natural,</HI> is commonly taken in so ma∣ny
senses, and is of such loose signification, that it
seems to little purpose to dispute, whether justice be
natural or not. If self-love, if benevolence be natu∣ral
to man; if reason and forethought be also natural;
then may the same epithet be applied to justice, or∣der,
fidelity, property, society. Men's inclination,
their necessities lead them to combine; their under∣standing
and experience tell them, that this combi∣nation
is impossible, where each governs himself by
no rule, and pays no regard to the possessions of
others: And from these passions and reflections con∣joined,
as soon as we observe like passions and re∣flections
in others, the sentiment of justice, thro' all
ages, has infallibly and certainly had place, to some
degree or other, in every individual of human spe∣cies.
In so sagacious an animal, what necessarily
arises from the exertion of his intellectual faculties,
may justly be esteemed natural<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Natural may be opposed, either to what is <HI>unusual, mira∣culous,</HI> or <HI>artificial.</HI> In the two former senses, justice and pro∣perty are undoubtedly natural. But as they suppose reason, forethought, design, and a social union and confederacy among men, perhaps, that epithet cannot strictly, in the last sense, be applied to them. Had men lived without society, property had never been known, and neither justice nor injustice had ever existed. But society among human creatures, had been impos∣sible, without reason and forethought. Inferior animals, that unite, are guided by instinct, which supplies the place of reason. But all these disputes are merely verbal.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="213"/>
AMONG all civilized nations, it has been the con∣stant
endeavour to remove every thing arbitrary and
partial from the decision of property, and to fix the
sentence of judges by such general views and consi∣derations,
as may be equal to every member of the
society. For besides, that nothing could be more
dangerous than to accustom the bench, even in the
smallest instance, to regard private friendship or en∣mity;
'tis certain, that men, where they imagine,
that there was no other reason for the preference of
their adversary but personal favour, are apt to enter∣tain
the strongest ill will against the magistrates and
judges. When natural reason, therefore, points out
no fixed view of public utility, by which a contro∣versy
of property can be decide, positive laws are
often framed to supply its place, and direct the pro∣cedure
of all courts of judicature. Where these too
fail, as often happens, precedents are called for;
<PB N="217" REF="214"/>
and a former decision, tho' given itself without any
sufficient reason, justly becomes a sufficient reason for
a new decision. If direct laws and precedents be
wanting, imperfect and indirect ones are brought in
aid; and the controverted case is ranged under them,
by analogical reasonings and comparisons, and simi∣litudes,
and<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> correspondencies, which are often more
fanciful than real. In general, it may safely be assert∣ed,
that jurisprudence is, in this respect, different
from all the sciences; and that in many of its nicer
questions, there cannot properly be said to be truth
or falshood on either side. If one pleader brings the
case under any former law or precedent, by a refined
analogy or comparison; the opposite pleader is not
at a loss to find an opposite analogy or comparison:
And the preference given by the judge is often
founded more on taste and imagination than on any
solid argument. Public utility is the general view of
all courts of judicature; and this utility too requires
a stable rule in all controversies: But where several
rules, nearly equal and indifferent, present them∣selves,
'tis a very slight turn of thought, which fixes
the decision in favour of either party<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>That there be a separation or distinction of possessions, and that this separation be steddy and constant; this is absolutely required by the interests of society, and hence the origin of jus∣tice and property. What possessions are assigned to particular persons; this is, generally speaking, pretty indifferent; and is often determined by very frivolous views and considerations. We shall mention a few particulars.</P>
<P>Were a society formed among several independent members, the most obvious rule, which could be agreed on, would be to annex property to <HI>present</HI> possession, and leave every one a right to what he at present enjoys. The relation of possession, which takes place between the person and the object, naturally draws on the relation of property.</P>
<P>For a like reason, occupation or first possession becomes the foundation of property.</P>
<P>Where a man bestows labour and industry upon any object, which before belonged to no body; as in cutting down and shap∣ing a tree, in cultivating a field, &amp;c. the alterations, which he produces, causes a relation between him and the object, and na∣turally engages us to annex it to him by the new relation of property. This cause here concurs with the public utility, which consists in the encouragement given to industry and labour.</P>
<P>Perhaps too, private humanity toward the possessor, concurs, in this instance, with the other motives, and engages us to leave with him what he has acquired by his sweat and labour; and what he has flattered himself in the constant enjoyment of. For tho' private humanity can, by no means, be the origin of justice; since the latter virtue so often contradicts the former; yet when the rule of separate and constant possesion is once formed by the indispensible necessities of society, private huma∣nity, and an aversion to the doing a hardship to another, may, in a particular instance, give rise to a particular rule of pro∣perty.</P>
<P>I am much inclined to think, that the right of succession or inheritance much depends on those connexions of the imagina∣tion, and that the relation to a former proprietor begetting a re∣lation to the object, is the cause why the property is transferred to a man after the death of his kinsman. 'Tis true; industry is more encouraged by the transference of possession to children of near relations: But this consideration will only have place in a cultivated society; whereas the right of succession is regarded even among the greatest Barbarians.</P>
<P>Acquisition of property by <HI>accession</HI> can be explained no way but by having recourse to the relations and connexions of the imagination.</P>
<P>The property of rivers, by the laws of most nations, and by the natural turn of our thought, is attributed to the proprietors of their banks, excepting such vast rivers as the RHINE or the DANUBE, which seem too large to follow as an accession the property of the neighbouring fields. Yet even these rivers are considered as the property of that nation, thro' whose do∣minions they run; the idea of a nation being of a suitable bulk to correspond with them, and bear them such a relation in the fancy.</P>
<P>The accessions, which are made to land, bordering upon rivers, follow the land, say the civilians, provided it be made by what they call <HI>alluvion,</HI> that is, insensibly and imperceptibly; which are circumstances, that assist the imagination in the con∣junction.</P>
<P>Where there is any considerable portion torn at once from one bank and added to another, it becomes not <HI>his</HI> property, whose land it falls on, till it unite with the land, and till the trees and plants have spread their roots into both. Before that, the thought does not sufficiently join them.</P>
<P>In short, we must every distinguish between the necessity of a separation and constancy in men's possession, and the rules, which assign particular objects to particular persons. The first necessity is obvious, strong, and invincible: The latter may depend on a public utility more light and frivolous, on the sentiment of private humanity and aversion to private hardship, on positive laws, on precedents, analogies and very fine connexions and turns of the imagination.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="218" REF="215"/>
WE may justly observe, before we conclude this
subject, that, after the laws of justice are fixed by
<PB N="219" REF="216"/>
views of general utility, the injury, the hardship, the
harm, which result to any indivdual from a violation
<PB N="220" REF="217"/>
of them, enter very much into consideration, and are
a great source of that universal blame, which attends
every wrong or iniquity. By the laws of society,
this coat, this horse is mine, and <HI>ought</HI> to remain per∣petually
in my possession: I lay my account with the
secure enjoyment of it: By depriving me of it, you
disappoint my expectations, and doubly displease me,
and offend every bystander. 'Tis a public wrong,
<PB N="221" REF="218"/>
so far as the rules of equity are violated: 'Tis a
private harm, so far as an individual is injured. And
tho' the second consideration could have no place,
were not the former antecedently established: For
otherwise the distinction of <HI>mine</HI> and <HI>thine</HI> would be
unknown in society: Yet there is no question, but
the regard to general good is much enforced by the
respect to particular. What injures the community,
without hurting any individual, is often more lightly
thought of. But where the greatest public wrong is
also conjoined with a considerable private one, no
wonder the highest disapprobation attends so iniqui∣tous
a behaviour.</P>

<HEAD>A
DIALOGUE.</HEAD>
<P>MY friend, PALAMEDES, who is as great a ram∣bler
in his principles as in his person, and who
has run over, by study and travel, almost every region
of the intellectual and material world, surprized me
lately with an account of a nation, with whom, he
told me, he had passed a considerable part of his life,
and whom he found, in the main, a people extremely
civilized and intelligent.</P>
<P>THERE is a state, said he, in the world, called
FOURLI, no matter for its longitude or latitude,
whose ways of thinking, in many things, particularly
in morals, are diametrically opposite to ours. When
I came among them, I found that I must submit to
double pains; first to learn the meaning of the terms
in their language, and then to know the import of
those terms, and the praise or blame attached to them.
After a word had been explained to me, and the cha∣racter,
which it expressed, had been described, I
concluded, that such an epithet must necessarily be
<PB N="224" REF="220"/>
the greatest reproach in the world; and was extreme∣ly
surprized to find one in a public company, apply
it to a person, with whom he lived in the strictest inti∣macy
and friendship. <HI>You fancy,</HI> said I, one day, to
an acquaintance, <HI>that</HI> CHANGUIS <HI>is your mortal ene∣my:
I love to extinguish quarrels; and I must, there∣fore,
tell you, that I heard him talk of you in the most
advantageous manner.</HI> But to my great astonishment,
when I repeated CHANGUIS'S words, though I had
both remembered and understood them perfectly, I
found, that they were taken for the most mortal af∣front,
and that I had very innocently rendered the
breach between these persons altogether irreparable.</P>
<P>As it was my fortune to come among this people on
a very advantageous footing, I was immediately intro∣duced
to the best company; and being desired to live
with ALCHEIC, I readily accepted his invitation; as
I found him universally esteemed for his personal
merit, and indeed regarded by every one in FOURLI,
as a perfect character.</P>
<P>ONE evening he invited me, as an amusement, to
bear him company in a serenade, which he intended
to give GULRI, with whom, he told me, he was
extremely enamoured; and I soon found his taste was
not singular: For we met many of his rivals, who had
come on the same errand. I very naturally concluded,
that this mistress of his must be one of the finest women
<PB N="225" REF="221"/>
in town; and I readily felt a secret inclination to see
her, and be acquainted with her. But as the moon
began to rise, I was much surprized to find, that we
were in the midst of the university, where GULKI
studied: And I was somewhat ashamed for having at∣tended
my friend, on such an errand.</P>
<P>I was told afterwards, that ALCHEIC'S choice of
GULKI was very much approved of by all the good
company in town; and that it was expected, while
he gratified his own passion, he would perform to that
young man the same good office, which he had him∣self
owed to ELCOUF. It seems ALCHEIC had been
very handsome in his youth, had been courted by
many lovers; but had bestowed his favours chiefly on
the sage ELCOUF; to whom he was supposed to owe
in a great measure, the astonishing progress which he
had made in philosophy and virtue.</P>
<P>IT gave me some surpize, that ALCHEIC'S wife
(who by-the-bye happened also to be his sister)
was no ways scandalized at this species of infidelity.</P>
<P>MUCH about the same time I discovered (for it was
not attempted to be kept a secret from me or any body)
that ALCHEIC was a murderer and a parricide, and
had put to death an innocent person, the most nearly
connected with him, and whom he was obliged to pro∣tect
and defend by all the ties of nature and humanity.
<PB N="226" REF="222"/>
When I asked, with all the caution and deference ima∣ginable,
what was his motive for this action; he re∣plied
coolly, that he was not then so much at his ease
as he is at present, and that he had acted, in that
particular, by the advice of all his friends.</P>
<P>HAVING heard ALCHEIC'S virtue so extremely
celebrated, I pretended to join in the general voice of
acclamation, and only asked, by way of curiosity, as
a stranger, which of all his noble actions was most
highly applauded; and I soon found, that all senti∣ments
were united in giving the preference to the as∣sassination
of USBEK. This USBEK had been to the
last moment ALCHEIC'S intimate friend, had laid
many high obligations upon him, had even saved his
life on a certain occasion, and had, by his will, which
was found after and murder, made him heir to a con∣siderable
part of his fortune. ALCHEIC, it seems,
conspired with about twenty or thirty more, most of
them also USBEK'S friends; and falling all together,
on that unhappy man, when he was not aware, they
had torne him with a hundred wounds; and given
him that reward for all his past favours and obliga∣tions.
USBEK, said the general voice of the people,
had many great and good qualities: His very vices
were shining, magnificent, and generous: But this
action of ALCHEIC sets him far above USBEK in the
eyes of all judges of merit; and is one of the noblest
that every perhaps the sun shone upon.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="223"/>
ANOTHER part of ALCHEIC'S conduct, which I
also found highly applauded, was his behaviour to∣wards
CALISH, with whom he was joined in a project
or undertaking of some importance. CALISH, being
a passionate man, gave ALCHEIC, one day, a sound
drubbing; which he took very patiently, waited the
return of CALISH'S good humour, kept still a fair
correspondence with him; and by that means brought
the affair, in which they were joined, to a happy issue,
and gained himself immortal honour by his remark∣able
temper and moderation.</P>
<P>I HAVE lately received a letter from a correspondent
in FOURLI, by which I learn, that since my depar∣ture,
ALCHEIC, falling into a bad state of health,
has fairly hanged himself; and has died universally re∣gretted
and applauded in that country. So virtuous
and noble a life, says each FOURLIAN, could not be
better crowned than by so noble an end; and AL∣CHEIC
has proved by this, as well as by all other ac∣tions,
what was his constant principle during his life,
and what he boasted of near his last moments, that a
wise man is scarce inferior to the great god, VITZLI.
This is the name of the supreme deity among the
FOURLIANS.</P>
<P>THE notions of this people, continued PALAMEDES,
are as extraordinary with regard to good-manners and
sociableness, as with regard to morals. My friend
<PB N="228" REF="224"/>
ALCHEIC formed once a party for my entertainment,
composed of all the prime wits and philosophers of
FOURLI; and each of us brought his mess along with
him to the place, where we assembled. I observed
one of them to be worse provided than the rest, and
offered him a share of my mess, which happened to be
a roasted pullet: And I could not but remark, that
he, and all the rest of the company smiled at my sim∣plicity.
I was told, that ALCHEIC had once so much
interest with his club as to prevail with them to eat
in common, and that he had made use of an artifice
to that purpose. He persuaded those, whom he ob∣served
to be <HI>worst</HI> provided, to offer their mess to the
company; after which, the others, who had brought
more delicate fare, were ashamed not to make the
same offer. This is regarded as so extraordinary an
event, that it has since, as I learn, been recorded in
the history of ALCHEIC'S life, composed by one of the
greatest geniuses of FOURLI.</P>
<P>PRAY, says I, PALAMEDES, when you was at
FOURLI, did you also learn the art of turning your
friends into ridicule, by telling them strange stories,
and then laughing at them, if they believed you. I
assure you, replied he, had I been disposed to learn
such a lesson, there was no place in the world more
proper. My friend, so often mentioned, did nothing,
from morning to night, but s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eer, and banter, and
rally; and you could scarce ever distinguish, whether
<PB N="229" REF="225"/>
he was in jest or earnest. But you think then, that
my story is improbable: and that I have used, or ra∣ther
abused the privilege of a traveller. To be sure,
says I, you was but in jest. Such barbarous and sa∣vage
manners are not only incompatible with a civi∣lized,
intelligent people, such as you said these were▪
but are scare compatible with human nature. They
exceed all we ever red of, among the MINGRELIANS,
and TOPINAMBOUES.</P>
<P>HAVE a care, cried he, have a care! You are not
aware that you are speaking blasphemy, and are abus∣ing
your favourites, the GREEKS, especially the
ATHENIANS, whom I have couched, all along, under
these bizarre names I employed. If you consider
aright, there is not one stroke of the foregoing cha∣racter,
which might not be found in the man of high∣est
merit at ATHENS, without diminishing in the least,
from the brightness of his character. The GREEK
love, their marriages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The laws of ATHENS allowed a man to marry his sister by the father. SOLON'S law forbid paederasty to slaves, as being an act of too great dignity for such mean persons.</NOTE>, and the exposing of their chil∣dren
cannot but strike you immediately. The death
of USBEK is an exact counter-part to that of CAESAR.</P>
<P>ALL to a trifle, said I, interrupting him: You did
not mention that USBEK was an usurper.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="226"/>
I DID not, replied he; lest you should discover the
parallel I aimed at. But even adding this circum∣stance,
we should make no scruple, according to our
sentiments of morals, to denominate BRUTUS, and
CASSIUS, ungrateful traitors and assassins: Though
you know, that they are, perhaps, the highest cha∣racters
of all antiquity; and the ATHENIANS erected
statues to them; which they placed near those of
HARMODIUS and ARISTOGITON, their own deliver∣ers.
And if you think this circumstance, which you
mention, so material to absolve these patriots, I shall
compensate it by another, not mentioned, which will
equally aggravate their crime. A few days before the
execution of their fatal purpose, they all swore fealty
to CAESAR; and protesting to hold his person ever
sacred, they touched the altar with those hands,
which they had already armed for his destruction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">APPIAN. Bell. Civ. lib. 3. SUETONIUS in vita CAESARIS.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I NEED not put you in mind of the famous and ap∣plauded
story of THEMISTOCLES, and of his patience
towards EURYBIADES, the SPARTAN, his command∣ing
officer, who, heated by a debate, lifted his cane
to him in a council of war, (the same thing as if he
had cudgelled him) <HI>Strike!</HI> cries the ATHENIAN,
<HI>strike! but hear me.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="231" REF="227"/>
YOU are too good a scholar not to discover the iro∣nical
SOCRATES and his ATHENIAN club in my last
story; and you would certainly observe, that it is ex∣actly
copied from XENOPHON, with a variation only
of the names<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. Soc. lib. 3. sub fine.</NOTE>. And I think I have fairly made it ap∣pear,
that an ATHENIAN man of merit might be such
a one as with us would pass for incestuous, a parri∣cide,
an assassin, an ungrateful, perjured traitor, and
something else too abminable to be named; not to
mention his rusticity and ill-manners. And having
lived in this manner, his death may be entirely suit∣able:
He may conclude the scene by a desperate act
of self murder, and die with the most absurd blasphe∣mies
in his mouth. And notwithstanding all this, he
shall have statues, if not altars, erected to his memo∣ry;
poems and orations shall be composed in his
praise; great sects shall be proud of calling themselves
by his name; and the most distant posterity shall
blindly continue their admiration: Though were such
a one to arise among themselves, they would justly
regard him with horror and execration.</P>
<P>I MIGHT have been aware, replied I, of your ar∣tifice.
You seem to take pleasure in this topic; and
are indeed the only man I ever knew, who was well
acquainted with the antients, and did not extremely
admire them. But instead of attacking their philoso∣phy,
<PB N="232" REF="228"/>
their eloquence, or poetry, the usual subjects of
controversy between us, you now seem to impeach
their morals, and accuse them of ignorance in a
science, which is the only one, in my opinion, in
which they are not surpassed by the moderns. Geo∣metry,
physics, astronomy, anatomy, botany, geo∣graphy,
navigation; in these we justly claim the su∣periority:
But what have we to oppose to their
moralists? Your representation of things is fallacious.
You have no indulgence for the manners and customs
of different ages. Would you try a GREEK or RO∣MAN
by the common-law of ENGLAND? Hear him
defend himself by his own maxims; and then pro∣nounce.</P>
<P>THERE
are no manners so innocent or reasonable,
which may not be rendered odious or ridiculous, if
measured by a standard, unknown to the persons;
especially, if you employ a little art or eloquence, in
aggravating some circumstances, and extenuating
others, as best suits the purpose of your discourse.
All these artifices may easily be retorted on you.
Could I inform the ATHENIANS, for instance, that
there was a nation, in which adultery, both active and
passive, so to speak, was in the highest vogue and
esteem: In which every man of education chose for
his mistress a married woman, the wife, perhaps, of
his friend and companion; and valued himself upon
these infamous conquests, as much as if he had been
<PB N="233" REF="229"/>
several times a conqueror in boxing or wrestling at the
<HI>Olympic</HI> games: In which every man, also, took a
pride in his tameness and facility with regard to his
own wife, and was glad to make friends or gain in∣terest
by allowing her to prostitute her charms; and
even, without any such motive, give her full liberty
and indulgence: I ask, what sentiments the ATHE∣NIANS
would entertain of such a people; they who
never mentioned the crime of adultery but in conjunc∣tion
with robbery and poisoning? Which would they
admire most, the villainy or the meanness of such a
conduct?</P>
<P>SHOULD I add, that the same people were as
proud of their slavery and dependance as the ATHE∣NIANS
of their liberty; and though a man among
them were oppressed, disgraced, impoverished, insulted,
or imprisoned by the tyrant, he would still regard it
as the highest merit to love, serve, and obey him;
and even to die for his smallest glory or satisfaction:
These noble GREEKS would probably ask me, whe∣ther
I spoke of a human society, or of some inferior,
servile species.</P>
<P>IT was then I might inform my ATHENIAN audi∣ence,
that these people, however, wanted not spirit
and bravery. If a man, says I, though their intimate
friend, should throw out, in a private company, a
raillery against them, nearly approaching any of those,
<PB N="234" REF="230"/>
with which your generals and demagogues every day
regale each other, in the face of the whole city, they
never can forgive him; but in order to revenge them∣selves,
they oblige him immediately to run them thro'
the body, or be himself murdered. And if a man,
who is an absolute stranger to them, should desire
them, at the peril of their own life, to cut the throat
of their bosom-companion, they immediately obey,
and think themselves highly obliged and honoured by
the commission. These are their maxims of honour:
This is their favourite morality.</P>
<P>BUT though so ready to draw their sword against
their friends and countrymen; no disgrace, no infamy,
no pain, no poverty will ever engage these people to
turn the point of it against their own breast. A man
of rank would row in the gallies, would beg his
bread, would languish in prison, would suffer any
tortures; and still preserve his wretched life. Rather
than escape his enemies by a generous contempt of
death, he would infamously receive the same death
from his enemies, aggravated by their triumphant in∣sults,
and by the most exquisite sufferings.</P>
<P>'TIS very usual too, continued I, among this peo∣ple
to erect jails, where every art of plaguing and
tormenting the unhappy prisoners is carefully studied
and practised: And in these jails it is usual for a parent
voluntarily to shut up several of his children; in or∣der,
<PB N="235" REF="231"/>
that another child, whom he owns to have no
greater or rather less merit than the rest, may enjoy
his whole fortune, and wallow in every kind of vo∣luptuousness
and pleasure. Nothing so virtuous in
their opinion as this barbarous partiality.</P>
<P>BUT what is more singular in this whim∣sical
nation, say I to the ATHENIANS, is, that
a frolic of yours during the SATURNALIA<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE GREEKS kept the feast of SATURN or CHRONUS, as well as the ROMANS. See LUCIAN. Epist. SATURN.</NOTE>,
when the sl<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves are served by their masters, is
seriously continued by them through the whole
year, and through the whole course of their
lives; accompanied too with some circumstances,
which still farther augment the absurdity and ridicule.
Your sport only elevates for a few days those whom
fortune has thrown down, and whom she too, in sport,
may really elevate for ever above you: But this na∣tion
gravely exalts those, whom nature has subjected
to them, and whose inferiority and infirmities are ab∣solutely
incurable. The women, though without vir∣tue,
are their masters and sovereigns: These they re∣verence,
praise and magnify: To these, they pay the
highest deference and respect: And in all places and
at all times, the sueriority of the females is readily
acknowledged and submitted to by every one, who
has the least pretensions to education and politeness.
<PB N="236" REF="232"/>
Scarce any crime would be so universally detested as
an infraction of this rule.</P>
<P>YOU need go no further, replied PALAMEDES; I
can easily conjecture the people whom you aim at.
The strokes, with which you have painted them, are
pretty just; and yet you must acknowledge, that
scarce any people are to be found, either in antient or
modern times, whose national character is, upon the
whole, less liable to exception. But I give you
thanks for helping me out with my argument. I had
no intention of exalting the moderns at the expence
of the antients. I only meant to represent the uncer∣tainty
of all these judgments concerning characters;
and to convince you, that fashion, vogue, custom and
law, were the chief foundation of all moral deter∣minations.
The ATHENIANS surely, were a civi∣lized,
intelligent people, if ever there was one; and
yet their man of merit might, in this age, be held in
horror and execration. The FRENCH are also, with∣out
doubt, a very civilized, intelligent people; and
yet their man of merit might, with the ATHENIANS,
be an object of the highest contempt and ridicule,
and even hatred. And what renders the matter more
extraordinary: These two people are supposed to be
the most similar in their national character of any in
antient and modern times; and while the ENGLISH
flatter themselves that they resemble the ROMANS,
their neighbours on the continent draw the parallel
<PB N="237" REF="233"/>
between themselves and those polite GREEKS. What
wide difference, therefore, in the sentiments of mo∣rals,
must be found between civilized nations and
Barbarians, or between nations whose characters have
little in common? How shall we pretend to fix a stan∣dard
for judgments of this nature?</P>
<P>BY tracing matters, replied I, a little higher, and
examining the first principles, which each national esta∣blishes,
of blame or censure. The RHINE flows
north, the RHONE south; yet both spring from the
<HI>same</HI> mountain, and are also actuated, in their oppo∣site
directions, by the <HI>same</HI> principle of gravity. The
different inclinations of the ground, on which they
run, cause all the difference of their courses.</P>
<P>IN how many circumstances would an ATHENIAN
and a FRENCH man of merit certainly resemble each
other? Good sense, knowledge, wit, eloquence, hu∣manity,
fidelity, truth, justice, courage, temperance,
constancy, dignity of mind. These you have all
omitted; in order to insist only on the points, in
which they may, by accident, differ. Very well: I
am willing to comply with you; and shall endeavour
to account for these differences from the most univer∣sal,
established principles of morals.</P>
<P>THE GREEK loves, I care not to examine more par∣ticularly.
I shall only observe, that, however blame∣able,
<PB N="238" REF="234"/>
they arose from a very innocent cause, the fre∣quency
of the gymnastic exercises among that people:
and were recommended, though absurdly, as the
source of friendship, sympathy, mutual attachment,
and fidelity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLAT. symp. p. 182. Ex edit. SE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE>; qualities esteemed in all nations and all
ages.</P>
<P>THE marriage of half-brothers and sisters seems no
great difficulty. Love between the nearer relations is
contrary to reason and public utility; but the precise
point, where we are to stop, can scarcely be deter∣mined
by natural reason; and is therefore a very pro∣per
subject of municipal law or custom. If the ATHE∣NIANS
went a little too far on the one side, the canon
law has surely pushed matters a great way into the
other extreme<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Enquiry, Sect. IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAD you asked a parent at ATHENS, why he be∣reaved
his child of that life, which he had so lately
given it. 'Tis because I love it, he would reply;
and regard the poverty which it must inherit from
me, as a greater evil than a death, which it is not
capable of dreading, feeling, or resenting<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">PLUT. de amore prolis, sub fine.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="235"/>
HOW is public liberty, the most valuable of all bles∣sings,
to be recovered from the hands of an usurper
or tyrant, if his power shields him from public rebel∣lion,
and our scruples from private vengeance? That
his crime is capital by law, you acknowledge: And
must the highest aggravation of his crime, the putting
himself above law, form his full security? You can
reply nothing, but by showing the great inconvenien∣cies
of assassination; which could any one have proved
clearly to the antients, he had reformed their senti∣ments
in this particular.</P>
<P>AGAIN, to cast your eye on the picture which I
have drawn of modern manners; there is almost as
great difficulty, I acknowledge, to justify FRENCH as
GREEK gallantry; except only, that the former is
much more natural and agreeable than the latter. But
our neighbours, it seems, have resolved to sacrifice
some of the domestic to the sociable pleasures; and to
prefer ease, freedom and an open commerce to a
strict fidelity and constancy. These ends are both
good, and are somewhat difficult to reconcile; nor
need we be surprized, if the customs of nations incline
too much, sometimes to the one side, sometimes to the
other.</P>
<P>THE most inviolable attachment to the laws of our
country is every-where acknowledged a capital virtue;
and where the people are not so happy, as to have
<PB N="240" REF="236"/>
any other legislature but a single person, the strictest
loyalty is, in that case, the truest patriotism.</P>
<P>NOTHING surely can be more absurd and barbarous
than the practice of duelling; but those, who justify
it, say, that it begets civility and good manners. And
a duelist, you may observe, always values himself upon
his courage, his sense of honour, his fidelity and
friendship; qualities, which are here indeed very
oddly directed, but which have been esteemed univer∣sally,
since the foundation of the world.</P>
<P>HAVE the gods forbid self-murder? An ATHE∣NIAN
allows, that it ought to be forborn. Has the
Deity permitted it? A FRENCHMAN allows, that
death is preserable to pain and infamy.</P>
<P>YOU see then, continued I, that the principles,
upon which men reason in morals are always the same;
though the conclusions which they draw are often very
different. That they all reason aright with regard to
this subject, more than with regard to any other, it is
not incumbent on any moralist to show. 'Tis suffici∣ent,
that the original principles of censure or blame
are uniform, and that erroneous conclusions can be
corrected by sounder reasoning and larger experience.
Though many ages have elapsed since the fall of
GREECE and ROME; though many changes have ar∣rived
in religion, language, laws, and customs; none
<PB N="241" REF="237"/>
of these revolutions has ever produced any consider∣able
innovation in the primary sentiments of morals,
more than in those of external beauty. Some minute
differences, perhaps, may be observed in both. HO∣RACE
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epist. lib. 1. epist. 7. Also lib. 1. ode 3.</NOTE> celebrates a low forehead, and ANACREON
joined eye-brows<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ode 28. PETRONIUS (cap. 86.) joins both these circum∣stances as beauties.</NOTE>: But the APOLLO and the VENUS
of antiquity are still our models for male and female
beauty; in like manner as the character of SCIPIO
continues our standard for the glory of heroes, and
that of CORNELIA for the honour of matrons.</P>
<P>IT appears, that there never was any quality, re∣commended
by any one, as a virtue or moral excel∣lence;
but on account of its being <HI>useful,</HI> or <HI>agreeable,</HI>
to a man <HI>himself,</HI> or to <HI>others.</HI> For what other rea∣son
can there ever be assigned for praise or approba∣tion?
Or where would be the sense of extolling a <HI>good</HI>
character or action, which, at the same time, is allowed
to be <HI>good for nothing?</HI> All the differences, therefore,
in morals may be reduced to this one general founda∣tion,
and may be accounted for by the different views,
which people take of these circumstances.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES men differ in their judgment about
the usefulness of any habit or action: Sometimes also
<PB N="242" REF="238"/>
the peculiar circumstances of things render one moral
quality more useful than others, and give it a pecu∣liar
preference.</P>
<P>'TIS not surprising, that, during a period of war,
and disorder, the military virtues should be more cele∣brated
than the pacific, and attract more the admira∣tion
and attention of mankind. “How usual is it.”
says TULLY<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Tusc. Quaest. lib. 2.</NOTE>, “to find CIMBRIANS, CELTIBE∣RIANS,
and other barbarians, who bear, with in∣flexible
constancy, all the fatigues and dangers of
the field; but are immediately dispirited under the
pain and hazard of a languishing distemper: while,
on the other hand, the GREEKS patiently endure
the slow approaches of death, when armed with
sickness and disease; but timorously s<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y his pre∣sence,
when he attacks them violently with swords
and falchions!” So opposite is even the same vir∣tue
of courage among warlike or peaceful nations!
And indeed, we may observe, that as the difference
between war and peace is the greatest which arises a∣mong
nations and public societies, it produces also the
greatest variations in moral sentiment, and diversifies
the raost our idea of virtue and personal merit.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES too, magnanimity, greatness of mind,
disdain of slavery, inflexible rigour and integrity, may
suit better the circumstances of one age than those of
<PB N="243" REF="239"/>
another, and have a more kindly influence, both on
public affairs, and on a man's own safety and advance∣ment.
Our idea of merit, therefore, will also vary a
little with these variations; and LABEO, perhaps, be
censured for the same qualities, which procured CATO
the highest approbation.</P>
<P>A DEGREE of luxury may be ruinous and perni∣cious
in a native of SWITZERLAND, which only fos∣ters
the arts, and encourages industry in a FRENCH∣MAN
or ENGLISHMAN. We are not, therefore, to
expect, either the same sentiments, or the same laws
in BERNE, which prevail in LONDON or PARIS.</P>
<P>DIFFERENT customs have also some influence as
well as different utilities; and by giving an early biass
to the mind, may produce a superior propensity,
either to the useful or the agreeable qualities; to
those, which regard self, or those, which extend to
society. These four sources of moral sentiment still
subsist; but particular accidents may, at one time,
make any one of them flow with greater abundance
than at another.</P>
<P>THE customs of some nations shut up the women
from all social commerce: Those of others make
them so essential a part of society and conversation,
that, except where business is transacted, the male∣sex
alone are supposed almost wholly incapable of
<PB N="244" REF="240"/>
mutual discourse and entertainment. As this diffe∣rence
is the most material, which can happen in pri∣vate
life, it must also produce the greatest variation in
our moral sentiments.</P>
<P>OF all nations in the world, where polygamy was
not allowed, the GREEKS seem to have been the most
reserved in their commerce with the fair-sex, and to
have imposed on them the strictest laws of modesty and
decency. We have a strong instance of this in an
oration of LYSIAS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Orat. 33.</NOTE>. A widow injured, ruined, un∣done,
calls a meeting of a few of her nearest friends
and relations; and though never before accustomed,
says the orator, to speak in the presence of men, the
distress of her circumstances constrained her to lay
the case before them. The very opening her mouth
in such company required, it seems, an apology.</P>
<P>WHEN DEMOSTHENES prosecuted his tutors, to
make them refund his patrimony, it became necessary
for him, in the course of the law-suit, to prove that
the marriage of APHOBUS's sister with ONETER was
entirely fraudulent, and that, notwithstanding her
sham marriage, she had lived with her brother at
ATHENS for two years last past, ever since her divorce
from her former husband. And tis remarkable, that
though these were people of the first fortune and di∣stinction
<PB N="245" REF="241"/>
in the city, the orator could prove this fact
no way, but by calling for her female slaves to be put
to the question, and by the evidence of one physician,
who had seen her in her brother's house during her
illness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Oneterem.</NOTE>. So reserved were GREEK manners.</P>
<P>WE may be assured, that an extreme purity was
the consequence of this reserve. Accordingly we find,
that, except the fabulous stories of an HELEN and
a CLYTEMNESTRA, there scarce is an instance of any
event in the GREEK history, which proceeded from the
intrigues of women. On the other hand, in modern
times, particularly in a neighbouring nation, the fe∣males
enter into all transactions and all management
of church and state: And no man can expect success,
who takes not care to obtain their good graces.
HARRY the third, by incurring the displeasure of the
fair, endangered his crown, and lost his life, as much
as by his indulgence to heresy.</P>
<P>'TIS needless to dissemble: The consequence of a
very free commerce between the sexes, and of their
living much together, will often terminate in intrigues
and gallantry. We must sacrifice somewhat of the
<HI>useful,</HI> if we be very anxious to obtain all the <HI>agree∣able</HI>
qualities; and cannot pretend to reach alike every
kind of advantage. Instances of licence, daily multi∣plying,
<PB N="246" REF="242"/>
will weaken the scandal with the one sex, and
teach the other, by degrees, to adopt the famous
maxim of LA FONTAINE, with regard to female insi∣delity,
<HI>that if one knows it, it is but a small matter;
if one knows it not, it is nothing</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><L>Quand on le s&amp;ccedil;ait c'est peu de chose:</L>
<L>Quand on ne le s&amp;ccedil;ait pas, ce n'est rien.</L></NOTE>.</P>
<P>SOME people are inclined to think, that the best
way of adjusting all differences, and of keeping the
proper medium between the <HI>agreeable</HI> and the <HI>useful</HI>
qualities of the sex is to live with them after the man∣ner
of the ROMANS and the ENGLISH (for the customs
of these two nations seem similar in this respect<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">During the time of the emperors, the ROMANS seem to have been more given to intrigues and gallantry than the ENG∣LISH are at present: And the women of condition, in order to retain their lovers, endeavoured to fix a name of reproach on those, who were addicted to wenching and low amours. They were called ANCILLARIOLI. See SENECA de beneficiis. Lib. 1. cap. 9. See also MARTIAL. lib. 12. epig. 58.</NOTE>) that
is, without gallantry<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">The gallantry here meant is that of amours and attach∣ments, not that of complaisance, which is as much paid to the fair-sex in England as in any other country.</NOTE> and without jealousy. By a
parity of reason, the customs of the SPANIARDS and of
the ITALIANS of an age ago (for the present are very
<PB N="247" REF="243"/>
different) must be the worst of any; because they
favour both gallantry and jealousy.</P>
<P>NOR will these different customs of nations affect
only the one sex: Their idea of personal merit in the
males must also be somewhat different with regard, at
least, to conversation, address, and humour. The
one nation, where the men live much apart, will na∣turally
more approve of prudence; the other, of
gaiety. With the one simplicity of manners will
be in the highest esteem; with the other, politeness.
The one will distinguish themselves by good-sense and
judgment; the other, by taste and delicacy. The
eloquence of the former will shine most in the senate;
that of the other, on the theatre.</P>
<P>THESE, I say, are the <HI>natural</HI> effects of such cus∣toms.
For it must be confessed, that chance has a
great influence on national manners; and many events
happen in society, which are not to be accounted for
by general rules. Who could imagine, for instance,
that the ROMANS, who lived freely with their women,
should be very indifferent about music, and esteem
dancing infamous: While the GREEKS, who never
almost saw a woman but in their own houses, were
continually piping, singing, and dancing?</P>
<P>THE differences of moral sentiment, which natu∣rally
arise from a republican or monarchical govern∣ment,
<PB N="248" REF="244"/>
are also very obvious; as well as those, which
proceed from general riches or poverty, union or
faction, ignorance or learning. I shall conclude this
long discourse with observing, that different customs
and situations vary not the original ideas of merit
(however they may, some consequences) in any very
essential point, and prevail chiefly with regard to
young men, who can aspire to the agreeable qualities,
and may attempt to please. The MANNER, the
ORNAMENTS, the GRACES, which succeed in
this shape, are more arbitrary and casual: But the
merit of riper years is almost every-where the same;
and consist chiefly in integrity, humanity, ability,
knowledge and the other more solid and useful quali∣ties
of the human mind.</P>
<P>WHAT you insist on, replied PALAMEDES, may
have some foundation, when you adhere to the max∣ims
of common life and ordinary conduct. Experi∣ence
and the practice of the world readily correct any
great extravagance on either side. But what say you
to <HI>artificial</HI> lives and manners? How do you reconcile
the maxims, on which in different ages and nations,
these are founded?</P>
<P>WHAT do you understand by <HI>artificial</HI> lives and
manners? said I. I explain myself, replied he. You
know, that religion had, in antient times, very little
influence on common life, and that, after men had
<PB N="249" REF="245"/>
performed their duty in sacrifices and prayers at the
temple, they thought, that the gods left the rest of
their conduct to themselves, and were little pleased or
offended with those virtues or vices, which only af∣fected
the peace and happiness of human society. In
those ages, it was the business of philosophy alone to
regulate men's ordinary behaviour and deportment;
and accordingly, we may observe, that this being the
sole principle, by which a man could elevate himself
above his fellows, it acquired a mighty ascendant
over many, and produced great singularities of max∣ims
and of conduct. At present, that philosophy has
lost the allurement of novelty, it has no such extensive
influence; but seems to confine itself mostly to specu∣lations
in the closet; in the same manner, as the an∣tient
religion was limited to sacrifices in the temple.
Its place is now supplied by the modern religion,
which inspects our whole conduct, and prescribes an
universal rule to our actions, to our words, to our
very thoughts and inclinations; a rule so much the
more austere, that it is guarded by infinite, though
distant, rewards and punishments; and no infraction
of it can ever be concealed or disguised.</P>
<P>DIOGENES is the most celebrated model of extra∣vagant
philosophy. Let us seek a parallel to him in
modern times. We shall not disgrace any philosophic
name by a comparison with the DOMINICS or
LOYOLAS, or any canonized monk or friar. Let us
<PB N="250" REF="246"/>
compare him to PASCAL, a man of parts and genius
as well as DIOGENES himself; and perhaps too, a
man of virtue, had he allowed his virtuous inclinations
to have exerted and displayed themselves.</P>
<P>THE foundation of DIOGENES'S conduct was an
endeavour to render himself an independent being as
much as possible, and to confine all his wants and de∣sires
and pleasures within himself and his own mind:
The aim of PASCAL was to keep a perpetual sense
of his dependance before his eyes, and never to forget
his numberless wants and necessities. The antient
supported himself by magnanimity, ostentation, pride,
and the idea of his own superiority above his fellow∣creatures.
The modern made constant profession of
humility and abasement, of the contempt and hatred
of himself; and endeavoured to attain these supposed
virtues, as far as they are attainable. The austerities
of the GREEK were in order to inure himself to hard∣ships,
and prevent his ever suffering: Those of the
FRENCHMAN were embraced merely for their own
sake, and in order to suffer as much as possible. The
philosopher indulged himself in the most beastly plea∣sures,
even in public: The saint refused himself the
most innocent, even in private. The former thought
it his duty to love his freinds, and to rail at them, and
reprove them, and scold them: The latter endeavour∣ed
to be absolutely indifferent towards his nearest rela∣tions,
and to love and speak well of his enemies. The
<PB N="251" REF="247"/>
great object of DIOGENES's wit was every kind of su∣perstition,
that is, every kind of religion known in
his time. The mortality of the soul was his standard
principle; and even his sentiments of a divine provi∣dence
seem to have been very licentious. The most
ridiculous superstitions directed PASCAL'S faith and
practice; and an extreme contempt of this life, in
comparison of the future, was the chief foundation of
his conduct.</P>
<P>IN such a remarkable contrast do these two men
stand: Yet both of them have met with general ad∣miration
in their different ages, and have been pro∣posed
as models of imitation. Where then is the uni∣versal
standard of morals, which you talk of? And
what rule shall we establish for the many different,
nay contrary sentiments of mankind?</P>
<P>AN experiment, said I, which succeeds in the air,
will not always succeed in a vacuum. When men de∣part
from the maxims of common reason, and affect
these <HI>artificial</HI> lives, as you call them, no-one can an∣swer
for what will please or displease them. They are
in a different element from the rest of mankind; and
the natural principles of their mind play not with the
same regularity, as if left to themselves, free from the
illusions of religious superstition or philosophical en∣thusiasm.</P>

<HEAD>THE
NATURAL HISTORY
OF
RELIGION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AS every enquiry, which regards religion is of the
utmost importance, there are two questions in
particular, which challenge our principal attention,
to wit, that concerning its foundation in reason, and
that concerning its origin in human nature. Happily,
the first question, which is the most important, ad∣mits
of the most obvious, at least, the clearest solu∣tion.
The whole frame of nature bespeaks an intel∣ligent
author; and no rational enquirer can, after se∣rious
reflexion, suspend his belief a moment with re∣gard
to the primary principles of genuine Theism
and Religion. But the other question, concerning
<PB N="254" REF="249"/>
the origin of religion in human nature, is exposed to
some more difficulty. The belief of invisible, intel∣ligent
power has been very generally diffused over
the human race, in all places and in all ages; but it
has neither perhaps been so universal as to admit of
no exceptions, nor has it been, in any degree, uni∣form
in the ideas, which it has suggested. Some
nations have been discovered, who entertained no
sentiments of Religion, if travellers and historians
may be credited; and no two nations, and scarce any
two men, have ever agreed precisely in the same sen∣timents.
It would appear, therefore, that this pre∣conception
springs not from an original instinct or
primary impression of nature, such as gives rise to
self-love, affection between the sexes, love of pro∣geny,
gratitude, resentment; since every instinct of
this kind has been found absolutely universal in all
nations and ages, and has always a precise determi∣nate
object, which it inflexibly pursues. The first re∣ligious
principles must be secondary; such as may
easily be perverted by various accidents and causes,
and whose operation too, in some cases, may, by an
extraordinary concurrence of circumstances, be alto∣gether
prevented. What those principles are, which
give rise to the original belief, and what those acci∣dents
and causes are, which direct its operation, is the
subject of our present enquiry.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<PB N="255" REF="250"/>
<HEAD>SECT. 1. That Polytheism was the primary Religion
of Men.</HEAD>
<P>IT appears to me, that if we consider the improve∣ment
of human society, from rude beginnings to a
state of greater prefection, polytheism or idolatry
was, and necessarily must have been, the first and
most antient religion of mankind. This opinion I
shall endeavour to confirm by the following argu∣ments.</P>
<P>'TIS
a matter of fact incontestable, that about
1700 years ago all mankind were idolaters. The
doubtful and sceptical principles of a few philoso∣phers,
or the theism, and that too not entirely pure, of
one or two nations, form no objection worth regard∣ing.
Behold then the clear testimony of history. The
farther we mount up into antiquity, the more do we
find mankind plunged into idolatry. No marks, no
symptoms of any more perfect religion. The most
antient records of human race still present us with
polytheism as the popular and established system.
The north, the south, the east, the west, give their
unanimous testimony to the same fact. What can be
opposed to so full an evidence?</P>
<P>As far as writing or history reaches, mankind, in
antient times, appear universally to have been poly∣theists.
<PB N="256" REF="251"/>
Shall we assert, that, in more antient times,
before the knowledge of letters, or the discovery of
any art or science, men entertained the principles of
pure theism? That is, while they were ignorant and
barbarous, they discovered truth: But fell into error,
as soon as they acquired learning and politeness.</P>
<P>BUT in this assertion you not only contradict all
appearance of probability, but also our present expe∣rience
concerning the principles and opinions of bar∣barous
nations. The savage tribes of AMERICA,
AFRICA, and ASIA are all idolaters. Not a single
exceptions to this rule. Insomuch, that, were a tra∣veller
to transport himself into any unknown region;
if he found inhabitants cultivated with arts and sci∣ences,
tho' even upon that supposition there are odds
against their being theists, yet could he not safely,
till farther enquiry, pronounce any thing on that
head: But if he found them ignorant and barbarous,
he might beforehand declare them idolaters; and
there scarce is a possibility of his being mistaken.</P>
<P>IT seems certain, that, according to the natural
progress of human thought, the ignorant multitude
must first entertain some groveling and familiar notion
of superior powers, before they stretch their concep∣tion
to that perfect Being, who bestowed order on
the whole frame of nature. We may as reasonably
imagine, that men inhabited palaces before huts and
<PB N="257" REF="252"/>
cottages, or studied geometry before agriculture; as
assert that the Deity appeared to them a pure spirit,
omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, before he
was apprehended to be a powerful, tho' limited be∣ing,
with human passions and appetites, limbs and
organs. The mind rises gradually, from inferior to
superior: By abstracting from what is imperfect, it
forms an idea of perfection: And slowly distinguish∣ing
the nobler parts of its frame from the grosser, it
learns to transfer only the former, much elevated and
refined, to its divinity. Nothing could disturb this
natural progress of thought, but some obvious and
invincible argument, which might immediately lead
the mind into the pure principles of theism, and
make it overleap, at one bound, the vast interval,
which is interposed between the human and the di∣vine
nature. But tho' I allow, that the order and
frame of the universe, when accurately examined,
affords such an argument; yet I can never think
that this consideration could have an influence on
mankind when they formed their first rude notions of
religion.</P>
<P>THE causes of objects, which are quite familiar to
us, never strike our attention or curiosity; and how∣ever
extraordinary or surprizing these objects may be
in themselves, they are passed over, by the raw and
ignorant multitude, without much examination or
enquiry. ADAM, rising at once, in paradise, and in
<PB N="258" REF="253"/>
the full perfection of his facculties, would naturally,
as represented by MILTON, be astonished at the glo∣rious
appearances of nature, the heavens, the air, the
earth, his own organs and members; and would be
led to ask, whence this wonderful scene arose. But a
barbarous, necessitous animal (such as man is on the
first origin of society) pressed by such numerous wants
and passions, has no leisure to admire the regular
face of nature, or make enquiries concerning the
cause of objects, to which, from his infancy, he has
been gradually accustomed. On the contrary, the more
regular and uniform, that is, the more perfect, na∣ture
appears, the more is he familiarized to it, and
the less inclined to scrutinize and examine it. A
monstrous birth excites his curiosity, and is deemed a
prodigy. It alarms him from its novelty; and im∣mediately
sets him a trembling, and sacrificing, and
praying. But an animal compleat in all its limbs and
organs, is to him an ordinary spectacle, and pro∣duces
no religious opinion or affection. Ask him,
whence that animal arose; he will tell you, from the
copulation of its parents. And these, whence?
From the copulation of theirs. A few removes sa∣tisfy
his curiosity, and set the objects at such a dis∣tance,
that he entirely loses sight of them. Imagine
not, that he will so much as start the question, whence
the first animal; much less, whence the whole system
or united fabric of the universe arose. Or, if you
start such a question to him, expect not, that he will
<PB N="259" REF="254"/>
employ his mind with any anxiety about a subject,
so remote, so uninteresting, and which so much ex∣ceeds
the bounds of his capacity.</P>
<P>BUT farther, if men were at first led into the be∣lief
of one supreme Being, by reasoning from the
frame of nature, they could never possibly leave that
belief, in order to embrace idolatry; but the same
principles of reasoning, which at first produced and
diffused over mankind, so magnificent an opinion,
must be able, with greater facility, to preserve it.
The first invention and proof of any doctrine is in∣finitely
more difficult than the supporting and retain∣ing
it.</P>
<P>THERE is a great difference between historical
facts and speculative opinions; nor is the knowledge
of the one propagated in the same manner with that
of the other. An historical fact, while it passes by
oral tradition from eye-witnesses and contemporaries,
is disguised in every successive narration, and may at
last retain but very small, if any, resemblance of the
original truth, on which it was founded. The frail
memories of men, their love of exaggeration, their
supine carelesness; these principles, if not corrected
by books and writing, soon pervert the account of
historical events, where argument or reasoning has
little or no place; nor can ever recal the truth, which
<PB N="260" REF="255"/>
has once escaped those narrations. 'Tis thus the
fables of HERCULES, THESEUS, BACCHUS are sup∣posed
to have been originally founded in true history,
corrupted by tradition. But with regard to specula∣tive
opinions, the case is far otherwise. If these opi∣nions
be founded in arguments so clear and obvious
as to carry conviction with the generality of man∣kind,
the same arguments, which at first diffused the
opinions, will still preserve them in their original pu∣rity.
If the arguments be more abstruse, and more
remote from vulgar apprehensions, the opinions will
always be confined to a few persons; and as soon as
men leave the contemplation of the arguments, the
opinions will immediately be lost and be buried in obli∣vion.
Which ever side of this dilemma we take, it
must appear impossible, that theism could, from rea∣soning,
have been the primary religion of human
race, and have afterwards, by its corruption, given
birth to idolatry and to all the various superstitions
of the heathen world. Reason, when very obvious,
prevents these corruptions: When abstruse, it keeps
the principles entirely from the knowledge of the
vulgar, who are alone liable to corrupt any prin∣ciples,
or opinions.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. II. Origin of Polytheism.</HEAD>
<P>In we would, therefore, indulge our curiosity, in
enquiring concerning the origin of religion, we must
turn our thoughts towards idolatry or polytheism, the
primitive Religion of uninstructed mankind.</P>
<P>WERE men led into the apprehension of invisible,
intelligent power by a contemplation of the works of
nature, they could never possibly entertain any con∣ception
but of one single being, who bestowed exist∣ence
and order on this vast machine, and adjusted all
its parts, according to one regular plan or connected
system. For tho', to persons of a certain turn of
mind, it may not appear altogether absurd, that seve∣ral
independent beings, endowed with superior wisdom,
might conspire in the contrivance and execution of
one regular plan; yet is this a mere arbitrary suppo∣sition,
which, even if allowed possible, must be con∣fessed
neither to be supported by probability nor ne∣cessity.
All things in the universe are evidently of a
piece. Every thing is adjusted to every thing. One
design prevails thro' the whole. And this uniformity
leads the mind to acknowledge one author; because
the conception of different authors, without any dis∣tinction
of attributes or operations, serves only to
<PB N="262" REF="257"/>
give perplexity to the imagination, without bestow∣ing
any satisfaction on the understanding<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The statue of LAOCOON, as we learn from PLINY, was the work of three artists: But 'tis certain, that, were we not told so, we should never have concluded, that a groupe of figures, cut from one stone, and united in one plan, was not the work and contrivance of one statuary. To ascribe any single effect to the combination of several causes, is not surely a natural and obvious supposition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, if, leaving the works of na∣ture,
we trace the footsteps of invisible power in the
various and contrary events of human life, we are
necessarily led into polytheism and to the acknow∣ledgement
of several limited and imperfect deities.
Storms and tempests ruin what is nourished by the
sun. The sun destroys what is fostered by the mois∣ture
of dews and rains. War may be favourable to
a nation, whom the inclemency of the seasons af∣flicts
with famine. Sickness and pestilence may de∣populate
a kingdom, amidst the most profuse plenty.
The same nation is not, at the same time, equally
successful by sea and by land. And a nation, which
now triumphs over its enemies, may anon submit to
their more prosperous arms. In short, the conduct of
events, or what we call the plan of a particular pro∣vidence,
is so full of variety and uncertainty, that,
if we suppose it immediately ordered by any intelli∣gent
<PB N="263" REF="258"/>
beings, we must acknowledge a contrariety in
their designs and intentions, a constant combat of
opposite powers, and a repentance or change of in∣tention
in the same power, from impotence or levity.
Each nation has its tutelar deity. Each element is
subjected to its invisible power or agent. The pro∣vince
of each god is separate from that of another.
Nor are the operations of the same god always cer∣tain
and invariable: To day he protects: To mor∣row
he abandons us. Prayers and sacrifices, rites
and ceremonies, well or ill performed, are the sources
of his favour or enmity, and produce all the good
or ill fortune, which are to be found amongst man∣kind.</P>
<P>WE
may conclude, therefore, that in all nations,
which have embraced polytheism or idolatry, the first
ideas of religion arose not from a contemplation of
the works of nature, but from a concern with regard
to the events of life, and from the incessant hopes
and fears, which actuate the human mind. Accord∣ingly,
we find, that all idolators, having separated
the provinces of their deities, have recourse to that
invisible agent, to whose authority they are immedi∣ately
subjected, and whose province it is to superin∣tend
that course of actions, in which they are, at any
time, engaged. JUNO is invoked at marriages;
LUCINA at births. NEPTUNE receives the prayers
<PB N="264" REF="259"/>
of seamen; and MARS of warriors. The husband∣man
cultivates his field under the protection of CERES;
and the merchant acknowledges the authority of
MERCURY. Each natural event is supposed to be
governed by some intelligent agent; and nothing pros∣perous
or adverse can happen in life, which may not
be the subject of peculiar prayers or thanksgivings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">“Fragilis et laboriosa mortalitas in partes ista digessit, in∣firmitatis suae memor, ut portionibus quisquis coleret, quo maxime indigeret.” PLIN. lib. ii. cap. 7 So early as HE∣SIOD'S time there were 30,000 deities. <HI>Oper. &amp; Dier.</HI> lib. i. ver. 250.

The province of copulation, suitable to the importance and dignity of it, was divided among several deities.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT must necessarily, indeed, be allowed, that, in
order to carry men's attention beyond the present
course of things, or lead them into any inference con∣cerning
invisible intelligent power, they must be actu∣ated
by some passion, which prompts their thought and
reflection; some motive, which urges their first enqui∣ry.
But what passion shall we here have recourse to, for
explaining an effect of such mighty consequence? Not
speculative curiosity surely, or the pure love of truth.
That motive is too refined for such gross apprehen∣sions,
<PB N="265" REF="260"/>
and would lead men into enquiries concerning
the frame of nature; a subject too large and com∣prehensive
for their narrow capacities. No passions,
therefore, can be supposed to work upon such bar∣barians,
but the ordinary affections of human life;
the anxious concern for happiness, the dread of fu∣ture
misery, the terror of death, the thirst of re∣venge,
the appetite for food and other necessaries.
Agitated by hopes and fears of this nature, especially
the latter, men scrutinize, with a trembling curiosity,
the course of future causes, and examine the various
contrary events of human life. And in this disor∣dered
scene, with eyes still more disordered and asto∣nished,
they see the first obscure traces of divinity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. III. The same subject continued.</HEAD>
<P>WE are placed in this world, as in a great theatre,
where the true springs and causes of every event, are
entirely unknown to us; non have we either sufficient
wisdom to foresee, or power to prevent those ills,
with which we are continually threatened. We hang
in perpetual suspense between life and death, health
and sickness, plenty and want; which are distributed
amongst the human species by secret and unknown
causes, whose operation is oft unexpected, and al∣ways
unaccountable. These <HI>unknown causes,</HI> then,
become the constant object of our hope and fear▪
<PB N="266" REF="261"/>
and while the passions are kept in perpetual alarm by
an anxious expectation of the events, the imagination
is equally employed in forming ideas of those powers,
on which we have so entire a dependance. Could
men anatomize nature, according to the most pro∣bable,
at least the most intelligible philosophy, they
would find, that these causes are nothing but the par∣ticular
fabric and structure of the minute parts of
their own bodies and of external objects; and that,
by a regular and constant machinery, all the events
are produced, about which they are so much con∣cerned.
But this philosophy exceeds the compre∣hension
of the ignorant multitude, who can only con∣ceive
the <HI>unknown causes</HI> in a general and confused
manner; tho' their imagination, perpetually em∣ployed
on the same subject, must labour to form some
particular and distinct idea of them. The more they
consider these causes themselves, and the uncertainty
of their operation, the less satisfaction do they meet
with in their research; and, however unwilling, they
must at last have abandoned so arduous an attempt,
were it not for a propensity in human nature, which
leads into a system, that gives them some seeming
satisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE is an universal tendency amongst mankind
to conceive all beings like themselves, and to transfer
to every object, those qualities, with which they are
familiarly acquainted, and of which they are inti∣mately
<PB N="267" REF="262"/>
conscious. We find human faces in the moon,
armies in the clouds; and by a natural propensity, if
not corrected by experience and reflection, ascribe
malice and good-will to every thing, that hurts or
pleases us. Hence the frequency and beauty of the
<HI>prosopopoeia</HI> in poetry, where trees, mountains and
streams are personified, and the inanimate parts of na∣ture
acquire sentiment and passion. And tho' these
poetical figures and expressions gain not on the belief,
they may serve, at least, to prove a certain tendency
in the imagination, without which they could neither
be beautiful nor natural. Nor is a river-god or hama∣dryad
always taken for a mere poetical or imaginary
personage; but may sometimes enter into the real
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reed of the ignorant vulgar; while each grove or
field is represented as possest of a particular <HI>genius</HI> or
invisible power, which inhabits or protects it. Nay,
philosophers cannot entirely exempt themselves from
this natural frailty; but have oft ascribed to inanimate
matter the horror of a <HI>vacuum,</HI> sympathies, antipath<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es,
and other affections of human nature. The absurdity
is not less, while we cast our eyes upwards; and trans∣ferring,
as is too usual, human passions and infirmities
to the deity, represent him as jealous and revengeful,
capricious and partial, and, in short, a wicked and
foolish man in every respect, but his superior power
and authority. No wonder, then, that mankind, be∣ing
placed in such an absolute ignorance of causes,
and being at the same time so anxious concerning
<PB N="268" REF="263"/>
their future fortunes, should immediately acknow∣ledge
a dependence on invisible powers, possessed of
sentiment and intelligence. The <HI>unknown causes,</HI>
which continually employ their thought, appearing
always in the same aspect, are all apprehended to be
of the same kind or species. Nor is it long before
we ascribe to them thought, and reason, and passion,
and sometimes even the limbs and figures of men,
in order to bring them nearer to a resemblance with
ourselves.</P>
<P>IN proportion as any man's course of life is go∣verned
by accident, we always find, that he encreases
in superstition; as may particularly be observed of
gamesters and sailors, who, tho' of all mankind, the
least capable of serious meditation, abound most in fri∣volous
and superstitious apprehensions. The gods,
says CORIOLANUS in DIONYSIUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. viii.</NOTE>, have an influ∣ence
in every affair; but above all, in war; where
the event is so uncertain. All human life, especially
before the institution of order and good government,
being subject to fortuitous accidents; it is natural,
that superstition should prevail every where in barba∣rous
ages, and put men on the most earnest enquiry
concerning those invisible powers, who dispose of
their happiness or misery. Ignorant of astronomy
and the anatomy of plants and animals, and too little
<PB N="269" REF="264"/>
curious to observe the admirable adjustment of final
causes; they remain still unacquainted with a first and
supreme creator, and with that infinitely perfect spirit,
who alone, by his almighty will, bestowed order on
the whole frame of nature. Such a magnificent idea
is too big for their narrow conceptions, which can
neither observe the beauty of the work, nor compre∣hend
the grandeur of its author. They suppose their
deities, however potent and invisible, to be nothing
but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised from
among mankind, and retaining all human passions
and appetites, together with corporeal limbs and or∣gans.
Such limited beings, tho' masters of human
fate, being, each of them, incapable of extending
his influence every where, must be vastly multiplied,
in order to answer that variety of events, which hap∣pen
over the whole face of nature. Thus every place
is stored with a crowd of local deities; and thus ido∣latry
has prevailed, and still prevails among the great∣est
part of uninstructed mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following lines of EURIPIDES are so much to the present purpose, that I cannot forbear quoting them:

ANY of the human affections may lead us into
the notion of invisible, intelligent power; hope as
well as fear, gratitude as well as affliction: But if
we examine our own hearts, or observe what passes
around us, we shall find, that men are much oftener
thrown on their knees by the melancholy than by the
agreeable passions. Prosperity is easily received as
our due, and few questions are asked concerning its
cause or author. It begets cheerfulness and activity
and alacrity and a lively enjoyment of every social
and sensual pleasure: And during this state of mind,
men have little leisure or inclination to think of the
unknown invisible regions. On the other hand,
every disastrous accident alarms us, and sets us on
enquiries concerning the principles whence it arose:
Apprehensions spring up with regard to futurity: And
the mind, sunk into diffidence, terror, and melan∣choly,
has recourse to every method of appeasing
those secret, intelligent powers, on whom our fortune
is supposed entirely to depend.</P>
<P>NO topic is more usual with all popular divines
than to display the advantages of affliction, in bring∣ing
men to a due sense of religion; by subduing their
confidence and sensuality, which, in times of pros∣perity,
make them forgetful of a divine providence.
<PB N="271" REF="266"/>
Nor is this topic confined merely to modern religions.
The ancients have also employed it. Fortune has ne∣ver
liberally, without envy, <HI>says a GREEK historian</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib iii.</NOTE>,
bestowed an unmixed happiness on mankind; but with all
her gifts has ever conjoined some disastrous circumstance,
in order to chastize men into a reverence for the gods,
whom in a continued course of prosperity, they are apt to
neglect and forget.</P>
<P>WHAT age or period of life is the most addict∣ed
to superstition? The weakest and most timid.
What sex? The same answer must be given. The
leaders and examples of every kind of superstition, <HI>says
STRABO</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. vii.</NOTE>, are the women. These excite the men to
devotion and supplications, and the observance of religi∣ous
days. It is rare to meet with one that lives apart
from the females, and yet is addicted to such practices.
And nothing can, for this reason, be more improbable,
than the account given of an order of men amongst the
<HI>GETES,</HI> who practised celibacy, and were notwith∣standing
the most religious fanatics. A method of rea∣soning,
which would lead us to entertain a bad idea
of the devotion of monks; did we not know by an
experience, not so common, perhaps, in STRABO'S
days, that one may practise celibacy, and profess
chastity; and yet maintain the closest connexions and
most entire sympathy with that timorous and pious sex.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IV. Deities not considered as creators or formers
of the world.</HEAD>
<P>THE only point of theology, in which we shall
find a consent of mankind almost universal, is, that
there is invisible, intelligent power in the world: But
whether this power be supreme or subordinate, whe∣ther
confined to one being, or distributed among se∣veral,
what attributes, qualities, connexions or prin∣ciples
of action ought to be ascribed to those beings;
concerning all these points, there is the widest diffe∣rence
in the popular systems of theology. Our ances∣tors
in EUROPE, before the revival of letters, believed,
as we do at present, that there was one supreme God,
the author of nature, whose power, tho', in itself,
uncontroulable, was yet often exerted by the interpo∣sition
of his angels and subordinate ministers, who
executed his sacred purposes. But they also believed,
that all nature was full of other invisible powers;
fairies, goblins, elves, sprights; beings, stronger and
mightier than men, but much inferior to the celestial
natures, who surround the throne of God. Now
suppose, that any one, in those ages, had denied the
existence of God and of his angels; would not his
impiety jus<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly have deserved the appellation of atheism,
even tho' he had still allowed, by some odd capricious
reasoning, that the popular stories of elves and fairies
<PB N="273" REF="268"/>
were just and well-grounded? The difference, on
the other hand, between such a person and a genuine
theist is infinitely greater than that, on the other, be∣tween
him and one, that absolutely excludes all in∣visible
intelligent power. And it is a fallacy, merely
from the casual resemblance of names, without any
conformity of meaning, to rank such opposite opinions
under the same denomination.</P>
<P>To any one, who considers justly of the matter, it
will appear, that the gods of all polytheists or idola∣tors
are no better than the elves or fairies of our an∣cestors,
and merit as little any pions worship or vene∣ration.
These pretended religionists are really a kind
of superstitious atheists, and acknowledge no being,
that corresponds to our idea of a deity. No first
principle of mind or thought: No supreme govern∣ment

temples, to make interest with the beadles or sextons,
in order to have a seat near the image of the deity,
that they might be the best heard in their prayers and

A plain proof, whence he derived his ideas of religion. See lib. xv. p. 364. Ex edit. RHODO∣MANNI.</NOTE>! But it was
merely by accident, that the question concerning the
origin of the world did ever in antient times enter
into religious systems, or was treated of by theolo∣gers.
The philosophers alone made profession of
delivering systems of this nature; and it was pretty
late too before these bethought themselves of having
recourse to a mind or supreme intelligence, as the first
cause of all. So far was it from being esteemed pro∣fane
in those days to accont for the origin of things
without a deity, that THALES, ANAXIMENES, HE∣RACLITUS,
and others, who embraced that system
of cosmogony, past unquestioned; while ANAXAGO∣RAS,
the first undoubted theist among the philoso∣phers,
was perhaps the first that ever was accused of
atheism<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It will be easy to give a reason, why THALES, ANAXI∣MANDER, and those early philosophers, who really were atheists, might be very orthodox in the pagan creed; and why ANAXA∣GORAS and SOCRATES, tho' real theists, must naturally, in antient times, be esteemed impious. The blind, unguided powers of nature, if they could produce men, might also pro∣duce such beings as JUPITER and NEPTUNE, who being the most powerful, intelligent existences in the world, would be proper objects of worship. But where a supreme intelligence, the first cause of all, is admitted, these capricious beings, if they exist at all, must appear very subordinate and dependent, and consequently be excluded from the rank of deities. PLATO (de leg. lib. x.) assigns this reason of the imputation thrown on ANAXAGORAS, viz. his denying the divinity of the stars, pla∣nets, and other created objects.</NOTE>.</P>

<L>Next <HI>earth,</HI> wide-stretcht, the <HI>seat</HI> of all.</L></Q>
the young scholar first betrayed his inquisitive genius,
by asking, <HI>And chaos whence?</HI> But was told by his

for a solution of such questions. And from
this hint, EPICURUS left philology and all other
studies, in order to betake himself to that science,
whence alone he expected satisfaction with regard to
these sublime subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="276"/>
THE common people were never likely to push
their researches so far, or derive from reasoning their
systems of religion; when philologers and mytholo∣gists,
we see, scarce ever discovered so much penetra∣tion.
And even the philosophers, who discoursed of
such topics, readily assented to the grossest theory,
and admitted the joint origin of gods and men from
night and chaos; from fire, water, air, or whatever
they established to be the ruling element.</P>
<P>Nor was it only on their first origin, that the gods
were supposed dependent on the powers of nature.
Thro' the whole period of their existence they were
subjected to the dominion of fate or destiny. <HI>Think
of the force of necessity,</HI> says AGRIPPA to the ROMAN

<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIONYS. HALIC. lib. vi.</NOTE>. And the yonger PLINY<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Epist. lib. vi.</NOTE>, suitable to this
way of reasoning, tells us, that, amidst the darkness,
horror and confusion, which ensued upon the first
eruption of VESUVIUS, several concluded, that all
nature was going to wrack, and that gods and men
were perishing in one common ruin.</P>
<P>IT is great complaisance, indeed, if we dignify
with the name of religion such an imperfect system
of theology, and put it on a level with latter systems,
which are founded on principles more just and more

sublime. For my part, I can scarce allow the prin∣ciples

<HEAD>SECT. V. Various Forms of Polytheism; Allegory,
Hero-Worship.</HEAD>
<P>BUT it is chiefly our present business to consider the
gross polytheism and idolatry of the vulgar, and to
trace all its various appearances, in the principles of
human nature, whence they are derived.</P>
<P>WHOEVER learns, by argument, the existence of
invisible, intelligent power, must reason from the ad∣mirable
contrivance of natural objects, and must sup∣pose
the world to be the workmanship of that divine
being, the original cause of all things. But the vulgar
polytheist, so far from admitting that idea, deifies
every part of the universe, and conceives all the con∣spicuous
productions of nature, to be themselves so
many real divinities. The sun, moon, and stars, are
<PB N="283" REF="278"/>
all gods, according to his system: Fountains are in∣habited
by nymphs, and trees by hamadryads: Even
monkies, dogs, cats, and other animals often become
sacred in his eyes, and strike him with a religious ve∣neration.
And thus, however strong men's propen∣sity
to believe invisible, intelligent power in nature,
their propensity is equally strong to rest their attention
on sensible, visible objects; and in order to recon∣cile
these opposite inclinations, they are led to unite
the invisible power with some visible object.</P>
<P>THE distribution also of distinct provinces to the
several deities is apt to cause some allegory, both
physical and moral, to enter into the vulgar systems
of polytheism. The god of war will naturally be
represented as furious, cruel, and impetuous: The
god of poetry as elegant, polite, and amiable: The
god of merchandise, especially in early times, as thievish
and deceitful. The allegories, supposed in HOMER and
other mythologists, I allow, have been often so strain∣ed,
that men of sense are apt entirely to reject them,
and to consider them as the product merely of the
fancy and conceit of critics and commentators. But
that allegory really has place in the heathen mytho∣logy
is undeniable even on the least reflection. CU∣PID
the son of VENUS; the Muses the daughters of
memory; PROMETHEUS, the wise brother, and EPI∣METHEUS
the foolish; HYGIEIA or the goddess of
health descended from AESCULAPIUS or the god of
<PB N="284" REF="279"/>
physic: Who sees not, in these, and in many other
instances, the plain traces of allegory? When a god
is supposed to preside over any passion, event, or sys∣tem
of actions, it is almost unavoidable to give him
a genealogy, attributes, and adventures, suitable to
his supposed powers and influence; and to carry on
that similitude and comparison, which is naturally so
agreeable to the mind of man.</P>
<P>ALLE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ORIES, indeed, entirely perfect, we ought
not to expect as the products of ignorance and su∣perstition;
there being no work of genius, that re∣quires
a nicer hand, or has been more rarely executed
with success. That <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Terror</HI> are the sons of
MARS is just; but why by VENUS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HESIOD. Theog. l. 935.</NOTE>? That <HI>Har∣mony</HI>
is the daughter of VENUS is regular; but why
by MARS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. &amp; PLUT. in vita PELOP.</NOTE>? That <HI>Sleep</HI> is the brother of <HI>Death</HI> is
suitable; but why describe him as enamoured of one
of the Graces<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">ILIAD xiv. 267.</NOTE>? And since the antient mythologists
fall into mistakes so gross and obvious, we have no
reason surely to expect such refined and long-spun
allegories, as some have endeavoured to deduce from
their fictions<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">LUCRETIUS was plainly seduced by the strong appearance of allegory, which is observable in the pagan fictions. He first addresses himself to VENUS as to that generating power, which animates, renews and beautifies the universe: But is soon be∣trayed by the mythology into incoherencies, while he prays to that allegorical personage to appease the furies of her lover.

THE deities of the vulgar are so little superior to
human creatures, that where men are affected with
strong sentiments of veneration or gratitude for any
hero or public benefactor; nothing can be more na∣tural
than to convert him into a god, and fill the
heavens, after this manner, with continual recruits
from amongst mankind. Most of the divinities of
the antient world are supposed to have once been
men, and to have been beholden for their <HI>apotheosis</HI>
to the admiration and affection of the people. And
the real history of their adventures, corrupted by
tradition, and elevated by the marvellous, became a
plentiful source of fable; especially in passing thro'
the hands of poets, allegorists, and priests, who suc∣cessively
improved upon the wonder and astonishment
of the ignorant multitude.</P>
<P>PAINTERS too and sculptors came in for their
share of profit in the sacred mysteries; and furnishing
men with sensible representations of their divinities,
whom they cloathed in human figures, gave great
encrease to the public devotion, and determined its
<PB N="286" REF="281"/>
object. It was probably for want of these arts in rude
and barbarous ages, that men deified plants, animals,
and even brute, unorganized matter; and rather than
be without a sensible object of worship, affixed di∣vinity
to such ungainly forms. Could any statuary of
SYRIA, in early times, have formed a just figure of
APOLLO, the conic stone, HELIOGABALUS, had ne∣ver
become the object of such profound adoration,
and been received as a representation of the solar

in the religious belief of the vulgar in other na∣tions;
when ATHENIANS and AREOPAGITES could
entertain such gross conceptions?</P>
<P>THESE then are the general principles of poly∣theism,
founded in human nature, and little or no∣thing
dependent on caprice and accident. As the
<PB N="287" REF="282"/>
<HI>causes,</HI> which bestow on us happiness or misery, are
in general, very unknown and uncertain, our anxious
concern endeavours to attain a determinate idea of
them; and finds no better expedient than to represent
them as intelligent, voluntary agents, like ourselves;
only somewhat superior in power and wisdom. The
limited influence of these agents, and their great
proximity to human weakness, introduce the various
distribution and division of their authority; and there∣by
give rise to allegory. The same principles natu∣rally
deify mortals, superior in power, courage, or
understanding, and produce hero-worship; together
with fabulous history and mythological tradition, in
all its wild and unaccountable forms. And as an
invisible spiritual intelligence is an object too refined
for vulgar apprehension, men naturally affix it to
some sensible representation; such as either the more
conspicuous parts of nature, or the statues, images,
and pictures, which a more refined age forms of its
divinities.</P>
<P>ALMOST all idolaters, of whatever age or country,
concur in these general principles and conceptions;
and even the particular charcters and provinces,
which they assign to their deities, are not extremely
different<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See CAESAR of the religion of the GAULS, De bello Gallico, lib. vi.</NOTE>. The GREEK and ROMAN travellers and

<HEAD>SECT. VI. Origin of Theism from Polytheism.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of one supreme deity, the author of
nature, is very antient, has spread itself over great
and populous nations, and among them has been em∣braced
by all ranks and conditions of persons: But
whoever thinks that it has owed its success to the pre∣valent
force of those invincible reasons, on which it
is undoubtedly founded, would show himself little
acquainted with the ignorance and stupidity of the
people, and their incurable prejudices in favour of
their particular superstitions. Even at this day, and
in EUROPE, ask any of the vulgar, why he believes
in an omnipotent creator of the world; he will ne∣ver
mention the beauty of final causes, of which he
is wholly ignorant: He will not hold out his hand,
and bid you contemplate the suppleness and variety
<PB N="289" REF="284"/>
of joints in his fingers, their bending all one way,
the counterpoise which they receive from the thumb,
the softness and fleshy parts of the inside of his hand,
with all the other circumstances, which render that
member fit for the use, to which it was destined. To
these he has been long accustomed; and he beholds
them with listlessness and unconcern. He will tell
you of the sudden and unexpected death of such a
one: The fall and bruise of such another: The ex∣cessive
drought of this season: The cold and rains of
another. These he ascribes to the immediate operation
of providence: And such events, as, with good rea∣soners,
are the chief difficulties in admitting a su∣preme
intelligence, are with him the sole arguments
for it.</P>
<P>MANY theists, even the most zealous and refined,
have denied a <HI>particular</HI> providence, and have asserted,
that the Sovereign mind or first principle of all things,
having fixed general laws, by which nature is governed,
gives free and uninterrupted course to these laws, and
disturbs not, at every turn, the settled order of events
by particular volitions. From the beautiful connexion,
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay they, and rigid observance of established rules,
we draw the chief argument for theism; and from
the same principles are enabled to answer the princi∣pal
objections against it. But so little is this under∣stood
by the generality of mankind, that, wherever
they observe any one to ascribe all events to natural
<PB N="290" REF="285"/>
causes, and to remove the particular interposal of a
deity, they are apt to suspect him of the grossest in∣fidelity.
<HI>A little philosaphy,</HI> says my lord BACON,
<HI>makes men atheists; A great d<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al reconciles them to re∣ligion.</HI>
For men, being taught, by superstitious pre∣judices,
to lay the stress on a wrong place; when
that fails them, and they discover, by a little reflection,
that the course of nature is regular and uniform, their
whole faith totters, and falls to ruin. But being
taught, by more reflection, that this very regularity
and uniformity is the strongest proof of design and
of a supreme intelligence, they return to that belief,
which they had deserted; and they are now able to
establish it on a firmer and more durable foun∣dation.</P>
<P>CONVULSIONS
in nature, disorders, prodigies,
miracles, tho' the most opposite to the plan of a wise
superintendent, impress mankind with the strongest
sentiments of religion; the causes of events seeming
then the most unknown and unaccountable. Mad∣ness,
fury, rage, and an inflamed imagination, tho'
they sink men nearest the level of beasts, are, for a
like reason, often supposed to be the only dispositions,
in which we can have any immediate communication
with the Deity.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, therefore, upon the whole, that
since the vulgar, in nations, which have embraced
<PB N="291" REF="286"/>
the doctrine of theism, still build it upon irrational
and superstitious opinions, they are never led into
that opinion by any process of argument, but by a
certain train of thinking, more suitable to their ge∣nius
and capacity.</P>
<P>IT may readily happen, in an idolatrous nation,
that, tho' men admit the existence of several limited
deities, yet may there be some one God, whom, in
a particular manner, they make the object of their
worship and adoration. They may either suppose, that,
in the distribution of power and territory among the
gods, their nation was subjected to the jurisdiction of
that particular deity; or reducing heavenly objects to
the model of things below, they may represent one
god as the prince or supreme magistrate of the rest,
who, tho' of the same nature, rules them with an au∣thority,
like that which an earthly sovereign exercises
over his subjects and vassals. Whether this god,
therefore, be considered as their peculiar patron, or
as the general sovereign of heaven, his votaries will
endeavour, by every act, to insinuate themselves, into
his favour; and supposing him to be pleased, like
themselves, with praise and flattery, there is no eulogy
or exaggeration, which will be spared in their addresses
to him. In proportion as men's fears or distresses be∣come
more urgent, they still invent new strains of
adulation; and even he who out-does his predecessors
<PB N="292" REF="287"/>
in swelling up the titles of his divinity, is sure to be
out-done by his successors in newer and more pompous
epithets of praise. Thus they proceed; till at last
they arrive at infinity itself, beyond which there is
no farther progress: And it is well, if, in striving to
get farther, and to represent a magnificent simplicity,
they run not into inexplicable mystery, and destroy
the intelligent nature of their deity; on which alone
any rational worship or adoration can be founded.
While the confine themselves to the notion of a per∣fect
being, the creator of the world, they coincide,
by chance, with the principles of reason and true
philosophy; tho' they are guided to that notion, not
by reason, of which they are in a great measure in∣capable,
but by the adulation and fears of the most
vulgar superstition.</P>
<P>WE often find, amongst barbarous nations, and
even sometimes amongst civilized, that, when every
strain of flattery has been exhausted towards arbitrary
princes, when every human quality has been ap∣plauded
to the utmost; their servile courtiers repre∣sent
them at last, as real divinities, and point them
out to the people as objects of adoration. How
much more natural, therefore, is it, that a limited
deity, who at first supposed only the immediate
author of the particular goods and ills in life, should
<PB N="293" REF="288"/>
in the end be represented as sovereign maker and
modisier of the universe?</P>
<P>EVEN where this notion of a supreme deity is al∣ready
established; tho' it ought naturally to lessen
every other worship, and abase every object of reve∣rence,
yet if a nation has entertained the opinion of
a subordinate tutelar divinity, saint, or angel; their
addresses to that being gradually rise upon them, and
encroach on the adoration due to their supreme deity.

seem still to have conceived the supreme Being as a

<P>HOMER, in one passage, calls OCEANUS and TE∣THYS
the original parents of all things, conformable
to the established mythology and tradition of the
GREEKS: Yet, in other passages, he could not for∣fear
complimenting JUPITER, the reigning deity,
with that magnificent appellation; and accordingly
denominates him the father of gods and men. He
forgets, that every temple, every street was full of the
ancestors, uncles, brothers and sisters of this JUPI∣TER;
who was in reality nothing but an upstart par∣ricide
and usurper. A like contradiction is observable
in HESIOD; and is so much the less excusable, that
his professed intention was to deliver a true genealogy
of the gods.</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="290"/>
WERE there a religion (and we may suspect Ma∣hometanism
of this inconsistence) which sometimes
painted the Deity in the most sublime colours, as the
creator of heaven and earth; sometimes degraded
him nearly to a level with human creatures in his
powers and faculties; while at the same time it as∣cribed
to him suitable infirmities, passions, and par∣tialities
of the moral kind: That religion, after it
was extinct, would also be cited as an instance of those
contradictions, which arise from the gross, vulgar,
natural conceptions of mankind, opposed to their
continual propensity towards flattery and exaggeration.
Nothing indeed would prove more strongly the di∣vine
origin of any religion, than to find (and happily
this is the case with Christianity) that it is free from a
contradiction, so incident to human nature.</P>

addressed to mere fictions and chimeras. But were
their religious principles any more resined, on account
of these magnificent pretensions? Every fifth year
they sacrificed a human victim, whom they sent as a
messenger to their deity, in order to inform him of
their wants and necessities. And when it thundered,
they were so provoked, that, in order to return the

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. Flux and reflux of polytheism and theism.</HEAD>
<P>IT is remarkable, that the principles of religion
have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind,
and that men have a natural tendency to rise from
idolatry to theism, and to sink again from theism into
idolatry. The vulgar, that is, indeed, all mankind,
a few excepted, being ingorant and uninstructed,
never elevate their contemplation to the heavens, or
penetrate by their disquisitions into the secret structure
of vegetable or animal bodies; so as to discover a
supreme mind, or original providence, which bestowed
order on every part of nature. They consider these
admirable works in a more confined and selfish view;
and finding their own happiness and misery to depend
on the secret influence and unforeseen concurrence of
external objects, they regard, with perpetual attention,
the <HI>unknown causes,</HI> which govern all these natural
events, and distribute pleasure and pain, good and
ill, by their powerful, but silent, operation. The
unknown causes are still appealed to, at every emer∣gence;
<PB N="299" REF="294"/>
and in this general appearance or confused
image, are the perpetual objects of human hopes and
fears, wishes and apprehensions. By degrees, the
active imagination of men, uneasy in this abstract con∣ception
of objects, about which it is incessantly em∣ployed,
begins to render them more particular, and
to clothe them in shape<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more suitable to its natural
comprehension. It represents them to be sensible,
intelligent beings, like mankind; actuated by love
and hatred, and flexible by gifts and entreaties, by
prayers and sacrifices. Hence the origin of religion:
And hence the origin of idolatry or polytheism.</P>
<P>BUT the same anxious concern for happiness, which
begets the idea of these invisible, intelligent powers,
allows not mankind to remain long in the first simple
conception of them; as powerful, but limited beings;
masters of human fate, but slaves to destiny and the
course of nature. Men's exaggerated praises and
compliments still swell their idea upon them; and
elevating their deities to the utmost bounds of perfec∣tion,
at last beget the attributes of unity and infinity,
simplicity and spirituality. Such refined ideas, being
somewhat disproportioned to vulgar comprehension,
remain not long in their original purity; but require
to be supported by the notion of inferior mediators or
subordinate agents, which interpose betwixt mankind
and their supreme deity. These demi-gods or middle
beings, partaking more of human nature, and being
<PB N="300" REF="295"/>
more familiar to us, become the chief objects of de∣votion,
and gradually recall that idolatry which had
been formerly banished by the ardent prayers and pa∣negyrics
of timorous and indigent mortals. But as
these idolatrous religions fall every day into grosser
and more vulgar conceptions, they at last destroy them∣selves,
and, by the vile representations, which they
form of their deities, make the tide turn again towards
theism. But so great is the propensity, in this alter∣nate
revolution of human sentiments, to return back
to idolatry, that the utmost precaution is not able
effectually to prevent it. And of this, some theists,
particularly the JEWS and MAHOMETANS, have been
sensible; as appears by their banishing all the arts of
statuary and painting, and not allowing the represen∣tations,
even of human figures, to be taken by marble
or colours; lest the common infirmity of mankind
should thence produce idolatry. The feeble appre∣hensions
of men cannot be satisfied with conceiving
their deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence;
and yet their natural <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>errors keep them from imputing
to him the least shadow of limitation and imperfection.
They fluctuate betwixt these opposite sentiments.
The same infirmities still drags them downwards,
from an omnipotent and spiritual deity, to a limited
and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited
deity to a statue or visible representation. The same
endeavour at elevation still pushes them upwards,
<PB N="301" REF="296"/>
from the statue or material image to the invisible power;
and from the invisible power to an infinitely perfect
deity, the creator and sovereign of the universe.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. IX. Comparison of these Religions, with regard
to Persecution and Toleration.</HEAD>
<P>POLYTHEISM or idolatrous worship, being found∣ed
entirely in vulgar traditions, is liable to this great
inconvenience, that any practice or opinion, however
barbarous or corrupted, may be authorized by it; and
full scope is left for knavery to impose on credulity,
till morals and humanity be expelled from the religious
systems of mankind. At the same time, idolatry is
attended with this evident advantage, that, by limit∣ing
the powers and functions of its deities, it natu∣rally
admits the gods of other sects and nations to share
of divinity, and renders all the various deities, as
well as rites, ceremonies, or traditions, compatible
with each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">VERRIUS FLACCUS, cited by PLINY, lib. xxviii. cap. 2. affirmed, that it was usual for the ROMANS, before they laid siege to any town, to invocate the tutelar deity of the place, and by promising him equal or greater honours than those he at present enjoyed, bribe him to betray his old friends and votaries. The name of the tutelar deity of ROME was for this reason kept a most religious mystery; lest the enemies of the republic should be able, in the same manner, to draw him over to their service. For without the name, they thought, nothing of that kind could be practised. PLINY says, that the common form of in∣vocation was preserved to his time in the ritual of the pontiss. And MACROBIUS has transmitted a copy of it from the secret things of SAMMONICUS SERENUS.</NOTE>. Theism is opposite both in its ad∣vantages
<PB N="302" REF="297"/>
and disadvantages. As that system supposes
one sole deity, the perfection of reason and g<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>odness,
it should, if justly prosecuted, banish every thing fri∣volous,
unreasonable, or inhuman from religious
worship, and set before men the most illustrious ex∣ample,
as well as the most commanding motives of
justice and benevolence. These mighty advantages
are not indeed over-ballanced, (for that is not possible)
but somewhat diminished, by inconveniencies, which
arise from the vices and prejudices of mankind. While
one sole object of devotion is acknowledged, the
worship of other deities is regarded as absurd and im∣pious.
Nay, this unity of object seems naturally to
require the unity of faith and ceremonies, and fur∣nishes
designing men with a pretext for representing
their adversaries as prophane, and the objects of di∣vine
as well as human vengeance. For as each sect is
positive that its own faith and worship are entirely ac∣ceptable
to the deity, and as no one can conceive,
that the same being should be pleased with different
and opposite rites and principles; the several sects
fail naturally into animosity, and mutually discharge
<PB N="303" REF="298"/>
on each other, that sacred zeal and rancour, the most
furious and implacable of all human passions.</P>
<P>THE tolerating spirit of idolaters both in antient
and modern times, is very obvious to any one, who
is the least conversant in the writings of historians or
travellers. When the oracle of DELPHI was asked,
what rites or worship was most acceptable to the gods?
Those legally established in each city, replied the
oracle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xenoph. Memor. lib. ii.</NOTE>. Even priests, in those ages, could, it
seems, allow salvation to those of a different commu∣nion.
The ROMANS commonly adopted the gods of
the conquered people; and never disputed the attri∣butes
of those topical and national deities, in whose
territories they resided. The religious wars and per∣secutions
of the EGYPTIAN idolaters are indeed an
exception to this rule; but are accounted for by an∣tient
authors from reasons very singular and remark∣able.
Different species of animals were the deities of
the different sects among the EGYPTIANS; and the
deities being in continual war, engaged their votaries
in the same contention. The worshippers of dogs
could not long remain in peace with the adorers of
cats or wolves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Plutarch, de Isid. &amp; Osiride.</NOTE>. And where that reason took not
place, the EGYPTIAN superstition was not so incom∣patable
as is commonly imagined; since we learn
<PB N="304" REF="299"/>
from HERODOTUS<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lib. ii. sub fine.</NOTE>, that very large contributions
were given by AMASIS towards rebuilding the tem∣ple
of DELPHI.</P>
<P>THE intolerance of almost all religions, which have
maintained the unity of God, is as remarkable as the
contrary principle in polytheists. The implacable,
narrow spirit of the JEWS is well known. MAHOME∣TANISM
set out with still more bloody principles;
and even to this day, deals out damnation, though
not fire and faggot, to all other sects. And if, a∣mongst
CHRISTIANS the ENGLISH and DUTCH
have embraced the principles of toleration, this singu∣larity
has proceeded from the steddy resolution of the
civil magistrate, in opposition to the continued efforts
of priests and bigots.</P>
<P>THE disciples of ZOROASTER shut the doors of
heaven against all but the MAGIANS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hyde de Relig. vet. Persarum.</NOTE>. Nothing
could more obstruct the progress of the PERSIAN con∣quests,
than the furious zeal of that nation against the
temples and images of the GREEKS. And after the
overthrow of that empire, we find ALEXANDER, as a
polytheist, immediately re-establishing the worship of
the BABYLONIANS, which their former princes, as
monotheists, had carefully abolished<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Arrian. de Exped. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>b. iu. Id. lib. vii.</NOTE>. Even the

blind and devoted attachment of that conqueror to
the GREEK superstition hindered not but he himself
sacrificed according to the BABYLONISH rites and ce∣remonies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SO sociable is polytheism, that the utmost fierce∣ness
and aversion, which it meets with in an opposite
religion, is scarce able to disgust it, and keep it at a
distance. AUGUSTUS praised extremely the reserve
of his grandson, CAIUS CAESAR, when passing by
JERUSALEM, he deig<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed not to sacrifice according to
the JEWISH law. But for what reason did AUGUS∣TUS
so much approve of this conduct? Only, because
that religion was by the PAGANS esteemed ignoble and
barbarous<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in vita. Aug. c. 93.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I MAY venture to affirm, that few corruptions of
idolatry and polytheism are more pernicious to politi∣cal
society than this corruption of theism<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Corruptio optimi pessima.</NOTE>, when
carried to the utmost height. The human sacrifices
of the CARTHAGINIANS, MEXICANS, and many
barbarous nations<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Most nations have fallen into this guilt; though perhaps, that impious superstition has never prevailed very much in any civilized nation, unless we except the CARTHAGINIANS. For
the TYRIANS soon abolished it.

For want of a bet∣ter way of doing him service, we do ourselves an injury; and fancy that we thereby express, at least, the heartiness of our good-will and adoration. Thus our mercenary devotion deceives ourselves, and imagines it deceives the deity.</NOTE>, scarce exceed the inquisition and

that the effusion of blood may not be so great in the
former case as in the latter; besides this, I say, the
human victims, being chosen by lot, or by some ex∣terior
signs, affect not in so confiderable a degree,
the rest of the society. Whereas virtue, knowledge,
love of liberty, are the qualities, which call down the
fatal vengeance of inquisitors; and when expelled,
leave the society in the most shameful ignorance, cor∣ruption,
and bondage. The illegal murder of one
man by a tyrant is more pernicious than the
death of a thousand by pestilence, famine, or any
undistinguishing calamity.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. X. With regard to courage or abasement.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the comparison of theism and idolatry, we
may form some other observations, which will also
consirm the vulgar observation, that the corruption of
the best things gives rise to the worst.</P>
<P>WHERE the deity is represented as infinitely supe∣rior
to mankind, this belief, though altogether just,
is apt, when joined with superstitious terrors, to sink
the human mind into the lowest submission and
abasement, and to represent the monkish virtues of
mortification, penance, humility and passive suffering,
as the only qualities which are acceptable to him.
But where the gods are conceived to be only a little
superior to mankind, and to have been, many of them,
advanced from that inferior rank, we are more at our
ease in our addresses to them, and may even, without
profaneness, aspire sometimes to a rivalship and emu∣lation
of them. Hence activity, spirit, courage, mag∣nanimity,
love of liberty, and all the virtues, which
aggrandize a people.</P>
<P>THE heroes in paganism correspond exactly to the
saints in popery and holy dervises in MAHOMETANISM.
The place of HERCULES, THESEUS, HECTOR.
ROMULUS, is now supplied by DOMINIC, FRANCIS,
ANTHONY, and BENEDICT. And instead of the de∣struction

of monsters, the subduing tyrants the de∣fence
of our native country; celestial honours are ob∣tained
by whippings and fastings, by cowardice and
humility, by abject submission and slavish obedience.</P>
<P>ONE great incitement to the pious ALEXANDER in
his warlike expeditions was his rivalship of HERCULES
and BACCHUS, whom he justly pretended to have ex∣celled<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arian. passim.</NOTE>. BRASIDAS, that generous and noble SPAR∣TAN,
after falling in battle, had heroic honours paid
him by the inhabitants of AMPHIPOLIS, whose de∣fence
he had embraced<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. lib. v.</NOTE>. And in general, all <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oun∣ders
of states and colonies amongst the GREEKS were
raised to this inferior rank of divinity, by those who
reaped the benefit of their labours.</P>
<P>THIS gave rise to the observation of MACHIAVEL<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Discorsi, lib. vi.</NOTE>,
that the doctrines of the CHRISTIAN religion (mean∣ing
the catholic; for he knew no other) which recom∣mend
only passive courage and suffering, had subdued
the spirit of mankind, and had fitted them for slavery
and subjection. And this observation would certain∣ly
be just, were there not many other circumstances
in human society, which controul the genius and
character of a religion.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="304"/>

<HEAD>SECT. XI. With regard to reason or absurdity.</HEAD>
<P>HERE is another observation to the same purpose,
and a new proof that the corruption of the best things
begets the worst. If we examine, without prejudice,
the antient heathen mythology, as contained in the
poets, we shall not discover in it any such monstrous
absurdity, as we may be apt at first to apprehend.
Where is the difficulty of conceiving, that the same
powers or principles, whatever they were, which
formed this visible world, men and animals, produced
also a species of intelligent creatures, of more refined
substance and greater authority than the rest? That
<PB N="310" REF="305"/>
these creatures may be capricious, revengeful, pas∣sionate,
voluptuous, is easily conceived; nor is any
circumstance more apt, amongst ourselves, to engen∣der
such vices, than the licence of absolute authority.
And in short, the whole mythological system is so na∣tural,
that, in the vast variety of planets and worlds,
contained in this universe, it seems more than proba∣ble,
that somewhere or other, it is really carried into
execution.</P>
<P>THE chief objection to it with regard to this planet,
is, that it is not ascertained by any just reason o<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> au∣thority.
The antient tradition, insisted on by the
heathen priests and theologers, is but a weak founda∣tion;
and transmitted also such a number of contra∣dictory
reports, supported, all of them, by equal au∣thority,
that it became absolutely impossible to fix a
preference amongst them. A few volumes, there∣fore,
must contain all the polemical writings of pagan
priests. And their whole theology must consist more
of traditional stories and superstitious practices than of
philosophical argument and controversy.</P>
<P>BUT where theism forms the fundamental principle
of any popular religion, that tenet is so conformable
to sound reason, that philosophy is apt to incorporate
itself with such a system of theology. And if the other
dogmas of that system be contained in a sacred book,
such as the Alcoran, or be determined by any visible
<PB N="311" REF="306"/>
authority, like that of the ROMAN pontif, speculative
reasoners naturally carry on their assent, and embrace
a theory, which has been instilled into them by their
earliest education, and which also possesses some de∣gree
of consistence and uniformity. But as these ap∣pearances
do often, all of them, prove deceitful,
philosophy will soon find herself very unequally yoaked
with her new associate; and instead of regulating each
principle, as they advance together, she is at every
turn perverted to serve the purposes of superstition.
For besides the unavoidable incoherences, which must
be reconciled and adjusted; one may safely affirm,
that all popular theology, especially the scholastic,
has a kind of appetite for absurdity and contradiction.
If that theology went not beyond reason and common
sense, her doctrines would appear too easy and fami∣liar.
Amazement must of necessity be raised: Mystery
affected: Darkness and obscurity sought after: And
a foundation of merit afforded the devout votaries,
who desire an opportunity of subduing their rebellious
reason, by the belief of the most unintelligible so∣phisms.</P>
<P>ECCLESIASTICAL
history sufficiently confirms these
reflections. When a controversy is started, some peo∣ple
pretend always with certainty to foretell the issue:
Which ever opinion, say they, is most contrary to
plain sense is sure to prevail; even where the general
<PB N="312" REF="307"/>
interest of the systern requires not that decision. Tho'
the reproach of heresy may, for some time, be ban∣died
about amongst the disputants, it always rests at
last on the side of reason. Any one it is pretended,
that has but learning enough of this kind to know the
definition of ARIAN, PELAGIAN, ERASTIAN, SO∣CINIAN,
SABELLIAN, EUTYCHIAN, NESTORIAN,
MONOTHELITE, &amp;c. not to mention PROTESTANT,
whose fate is yet uncertain, will be convinced of the
truth of this observation. And thus a system becomes
more absurd in the end, merely from its being reason∣able
and philosophical in the beginning.</P>
<P>To oppose the torrent of scholastic religion by such
feeble maxims as these, that <HI>it is impossible for the same
thing to be and not to be,</HI> that <HI>the whole is greater than
a part,</HI> that <HI>two and three make five;</HI> is pretending to
stop the ocean with a bull-rush. Will you set up pro∣sane
reason against sacred mystery? No punishment is
great enough for your impiety. And the same fires,

destruction of philosophers.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. XII. With regard to doubt or conviction.</HEAD>
<P>We meet every day with people so sceptical with

nation ever to believe such absurd principles as those
of GREEK and EGYPTIAN paganism; and at the
<PB N="313" REF="308"/>
same time so dogmatical with regard to religion, that
they think the same absurdities are to be sound in no
other communions. CAMBYSES entertained like pre∣judices;

of passion to a real madness or disorder of the brain:
Otherwise, says the historian, he never would have
openly affronted any established worship. For on
that head, continues he, every nation are best satis∣fied
with their own, and think they have the advan∣tage
over every other nation.</P>
<P>IT must be allowed, that the ROMAN catholics are
a very learned sect; and that no one communion, but
that of the church of ENGLAND, can dispute their be∣ing
the most learned of all the christian churches: Yet
AVERROES, the famous ARABIAN, who, no doubt,
had heard of the EGYPTIAN superstitions, declares,
that, of all religions, the most absurd and non-sensical
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that, whose votaries eat, after having created, their deity.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE, indeed, that there is no tenet in all
paganism, which would give so fair a scope to ridicule
as this of the <HI>real presence:</HI> For it is so absurd, that it
<PB N="314" REF="309"/>
eludes the force of almost all argument. There are
even some pleasant stories of that kind, which, though
somewhat profane, are commonly told by the Catho∣lics
themselves. One day, a priest, it is said, gave
inadvertently, instead of the sacrament, a counter,
which had by accident fallen among the holy wasers.
The communicant waited patiently for some time, ex∣pecting
it would dissolve on his tongue: But finding,
that it still remained entire, he took it off. I <HI>wish,</HI>
cries he to the priest, <HI>you have not committed some m<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s∣take:
I wish you have not given me God the Father:
He is so hard and tough there is no swallowing him.</HI></P>
<P>A FAMOUS general, at that time in the MUSCO∣VITE
service, having come to PARIS for the recovery
of his wounds, brought along with him a young
TURK, whom he had taken prisoner. Some of the
doctors of the SORBONNE (who are altogether as posi∣tive
as the dervises of CONSTANTINOPLE) thinking it
a pity, that the poor TURK should be damned ser
want of instruction, sollicited MUSTAPHA very hard
to turn Christian, and promised him, for his encou∣ragement,
plenty of good wine in this world, and
paradise in the next. These al<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urements were too
powerful to be resisted; and therefore, having been
well instructed and catechized, he at last agreed to
receive the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's sup∣per.
The priest, however, to make every thing sure
<PB N="315" REF="310"/>
and solid, still continued his instructions; and began
his catechism the next day with the usual question,
<HI>How many Gods are there? None at all,</HI> replies BENE∣DICT;
for that was his new name. <HI>How! None at
al!</HI> cries the priest. <HI>To be sure, said</HI> the honest pro∣selyte.
<HI>You have told me all along that there is but one
God: And yesterday I eat him.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH are the doctrines of our brethren, the Catho∣lics.
But to these doctrines we are so accustomed,
that we never wonder at them: Though, in a future
age, it will probably become difficult to persuade
some nations, that any human, two-legged creature,
could ever embrace such principles. And it is a thou∣sand
to one, but these nations themselves shall have
something full as absurd in their own creed, to which
they will give a most implicite and most religious
assent.</P>
<P>I LODGED once at PARIS, in the same <HI>hotel</HI> with

remarkable instance to this purpose, of which he was
himself an eye-witness. While EGYPT lay under the
greatest terror of the ROMAN name, a legionary sol∣dier
having inadvertently been guilty of the sacrilegi∣ous
impiety of killing a cat, the whole people rose
upon him with the utmost fury; and all the efforts of
the prince were not able to save him. The senate
and people of ROME, I am persuaded, would not,
then, have been so delicate with regard to their na∣tional
deities. They very frankly, a little after
that time, voted AUGUSTUS a place in the celcstial

THERE occurs, I own, a difficulty in the EGYP∣TIAN
system of theology; as indeed, few systems are
entirely free from difficulties. It is evident, from
their method of propagation, that a couple of cats,
in fifty years, would stock a whole kingdom; and if
that religious veneration were still paid them, it would
<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n twenty more, not only be easier in EGYPT to find
a god than a man, which PETRONIUS says was the

<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in antiquity for prudence and sound policy,
foreseeing such dangerous consequences, reserved all
their worship for the full grown divinities, and used the
freedom to drown the holy spawn or little sucking gods,
without any scrup<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e or remorse. And thus the prac∣tice

<P>IF ever there was a nation or a time, in which the
public religion lost all authority over mankind, we
might expect, that infidelity in ROME, during the
CICERONIAN age, would openly have erected its
throne, and that CICERO himself, in every speech and
action, would have been its most declared abettor.
But it appears, that, whatever sceptical liberties that
great man might use, in his writings or in philosophical
conversation; he yet avoided, in the common con∣duct
of life, the imputation of deism and profaneness.
Even in his own family, and to his wife TERENTIA,
whom he highly trusted, he was willing to appear a
devout religionist; and there remains a letter, ad∣dressed
to her, in which he seriously desires her to of∣fer
<PB N="322" REF="317"/>
sacrifice to APOLLO and AESCULAPIUS, in grati∣tude
for the recovery of his health<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. 14. epist. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>POMPEY'S devotion was much more sincere:
In all his conduct, during the civil wars, he paid a
great regard to auguries, dreams, and prophecies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cicero de divin. lib. 2. c. 24.</NOTE>.
AUGUSTUS was tainted with superstition of every
kind. As it is reported of MILTON, that his poeti∣cal
genius never flowed with ease and abundance in
the spring; so AUGUSTUS observed, that his own
genius for dreaming never was so perfect during that
season, nor was so much to be relied on, as during
the rest of the year. That great and able emperor
was also extremely uneasy when he happened to
change his shoes, and put the right foot shoe on the
left foot<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Sueton. Aug. cap. 90, 91, 92. Plin. lib. ii. cap. 7.</NOTE>. In short, it cannot be doubted, but the
votaries of the established superstition of antiquity were
as numerous in every state, as those of the modern
religion are at present. Its influence was as univer∣sal;
tho' it was not so great. As many people gave
their assent to it; tho' that assent was not seemingly
so strong, precise, and affirmative.</P>
<P>WE may observe, that, notwithstanding the dog∣matical,
imperious style of all superstition, the con∣viction
<PB N="323" REF="318"/>
of the religionists, in all ages, is more affected
than real, and scarce ever approaches, in any degree,
to that solid belief and persuasion, which governs us
in the common affairs of life. Men dare not avow,
even to their own hearts, the doubts, which they en∣tertain
on such subjects: They make a merit of im∣plicit
faith; and disguise to themselves their real in∣fidelity,
by the strongest asseverations and most posi∣tive
bigotry. But nature is too hard for all their en∣deavours,
and suffers not the obscure, glimmering
light, afforded in those shadowy regions, to equal the
strong impressions, made by common sense and by
experience. The usual course of men's conduct be∣lies
their words, and shows, that the assent in these
matters is some unaccountable operation of the mind
between disbelief and conviction, but approaching
much nearer the former than the latter.</P>
<P>SINCE, therefore, the mind of man appears of so
loose and unsteddy a contexture, that, even at pre∣sent,
when so many persons find an interest in con∣tinually
employing on it the chissel and the hammer,
yet are they not able to engrave theological tenets
with any lasting impression; how much more must
this have been the case in antient times, when the
retainers to the holy function were so much fewer in
comparison? No wonder, that the appearances were
then very inconsistent, and that men, on some occa∣sions,
might seem determined infidels, and enemies
<PB N="324" REF="319"/>
to the established religion, without being so in reality;
or at least, without knowing their own minds in that
particular.</P>
<P>ANOTHER cause, which rendered the antient reli∣gions
much looser than the modern, is, that the for∣mer
were <HI>traditional</HI> and the latter are <HI>scriptural;</HI> and
the tradition in the former was complex, contradic∣tory,
and, on many occasions, doubtful; so that it
could not possibly be reduced to any standard and
canon, or afford any determinate articles of faith.
The stories of the gods were numberless like the
popish legends; and tho' every one, almost, believed
a part of these stories, yet no one could believe or
know the whole: While, at the same time, all must
have acknowledged, that no one part stood on a bet∣ter
foundation than the <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est. The traditions of dif∣ferent
cities and nations were also, on many occasions,
directly opposite; and no reason could be found for
preferring one to the other. And as there was an
infinite number of stories with regard to which tradi∣tion
was no way positive; the gradation was in∣sensible,
from the most fundamental articles of faith,
to those loose and precarious fictions. The pagan re∣ligion,
therefore, seemed to vanish like a cloud, when∣ever
one approached to it, and examined it piecemeal.
It could never be ascertained by any fixed dogmas
and principles. And tho' this did not convert the
generality of mankind from so absurd a faith; for
<PB N="325" REF="320"/>
when will the people be reasonable? yet it made
them faulter and hesitate more in maintaining their
principles, and was even apt to produce, in certain
dispositions of mind, some practices and opinions,
which had the appearance of determined infidelity.</P>
<P>TO which we may add, that the fables of the pa∣gan
religion were, of themselves, light, easy, and
familiar; without devils or seas of brimstone, or any
objects, that could much terrify the imagination.
Who could forbear smiling, when he thought of the
loves of MARS and VENUS, or the amorous frolics
of JUPITER and PAN? In this respect, it was a true
poetical religion; if it had not rather too much levity
for the graver kinds of poetry. We find that it has
been adopted by modern bards; nor have these talked
with greater freedom and irreverence of the gods,
whom they regarded as fictions, than the antient did
of the real objects of their devotion.</P>
<P>THE inference is by no means just, that because a
system of religion has made no deep impression on
the minds of a people, it must therefore have been
positively rejected by all men of common sense, and
that opposite principles, in spite of the prejudices of
education, were generally established by argument
and reasoning. I know not, but a contrary inference
may be more probable. The less importunate and
assuming any species of superstition appears, the less
<PB N="326" REF="321"/>
will it provoke men's spleen and indignation, or en∣gage
them into enquiries concerning its foundation
and origin. This in the mean time is obvious, that
the empire of all religious faith over the understand∣ing
is wavering and uncertain, subject to all va∣rieties
of humour, and dependent on the present in∣cidents,
which strike the imagination. The diffe∣rence
is only in the degrees. An antient will place
a stroke of impiety and one of superstition alternately,
thro' a whole discourse<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Witness this remarkable passage of TACITUS: “Praeter multiplices rerum humanarum casus, coelo terraque prodigia, &amp; fulminum monitus, &amp; futurorum praesagia, laeta, tristia, ambigua, manifesta.

AUGUSTUS's quarrel with NEPTUNE is an instance of the same kind. Had not the emperor believed NEPTUNE to be a real being, and to have dominion over the sea; where had been the foundation of his anger? And if he believed it, what madness to provoke still farther that deity? The same observa∣tion may be made upon QUINTILIAN's exclamations, on ac∣count of the death of his children, lib. vi.

They forgot to add, that he was not inferior in pru∣dence

nothing can be more pitiful than the sentiments, which
that sect entertained with regard to all popular super∣stitions;
while they very seriously agree with the com∣mon
augurs, that, when a raven croaks from the left,
it is a good omen; but a bad one, when a rook
makes a noise from the same quarter. PANAETIUS

and must augment the ghastliness and horror, which
oppresses the amazed religionist. A panic having
once scized the mind, the active fancy still farther
<PB N="333" REF="328"/>
multiplies the objects of terror; while that profound
darkness, or, what is worse, that glimmering light,
with which we are invironed, represents the spectres of
divinity under the most dreadful appearances imagin∣able.
And no idea of perverse wickedness can be
framed, which those terrified devotees do not readily,
without scruple, apply to their deity.</P>
<P>THIS appears the natural state of religion, when
surveyed in one light. But if we consider, on the
other hand, that spirit of praise and eulogy, which
necessarily has place in all religions, and which is the
consequence of these very terrors, we must expect a
quite contrary system of theology to prevail. Every
virtue, every excellence, must be ascribed to the di∣vinity,
and no exaggeration be esteemed sufficient to
reach those perfections, with which he is endowed.
Whatever strains of panegyric can be invented, are
immediately embraced, without consulting any argu∣ments
or phaenomena. And it is esteemed a sufficient
confirmation of them, that they give us more mag∣nificent
ideas of the divine object of our worship and
adoration.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is a kind of contradiction between
the different principles of human nature, which enter
into religion. Our natural terrors present the notion
of a devilish and malicious deity: Our propensity to
praise leads us to acknowledge an excellent and di∣vine.
<PB N="334" REF="329"/>
And the influence of these opposite principles
are various, according to the different situation of the
human understanding.</P>
<P>IN very barbarous and ignorant nations, such as
the AFRICANS and INDIANS, nay even the JAPO∣NESE,
who can form no extensive ideas of power and
knowledge, worship may be paid to a being, whom
they confess to be wicked and detestable; tho' they
may be cautious, perhaps, of pronouncing this judg∣ment
of him in public, or in his temple, where he
may be supposed to hear their reproaches.</P>
<P>SUCH rude, imperfect ideas of the divinity adhere
long to all idola<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers; and it may safely be affirmed,
that the GREEKS themselves never got entirely rid of
them. It is remarked by XENOPHON<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mem. lib. i.</NOTE>, in praise of
SOCRATES, that that philosopher assented not to the
vulgar opinion, which supposed the gods to know
some things, and be ignorant of others: He main∣tained
that they knew every thing; what was done,
said, or even thought. But as this was a strain of
philosophy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It was considered among the antients, as a very extraordi∣nary, philosophical paradox, that the presence of the gods was not confined to the heavens, but was extended every where; as we leain from LUCIAN. <HI>Hermotimus sive De sectis.</HI></NOTE> much above the conception of his coun∣trymen,
<PB N="335" REF="330"/>
we need not be surprized, if very frankly,
in their books and conversation, they blamed the de∣ities,
whom they woirshipped in their temples. It is
observable, that HERODOTUS in particular scruples
not, in many passages, to ascribe <HI>envy</HI> to the gods;
a sentiment, of all others, the most suitable to a mean
and devilish nature. The pagan hymns however,
sung in public worship, contained nothing but epi∣thets
of praise; even while the actions ascribed to the
gods were the most barbarous and detestable. When
TIMOTHEUS, the poet, recited a hymn to DIANA,
where he enumerated, with the greatest eulogies, all
the actions and attributes of that cruel, capricious
goddess: <HI>May your daughter,</HI> said one present, <HI>become
such as the deity whom you celebrate</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH. de Superstit.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as men farther exalt their idea of their divi∣nity;
it is often their notion of his power and know∣ledge
only, not of his goodness, which is improved.
On the contrary, in proportion to the supposed extent
of his science and authority, their terrors naturally
augment; while they believe, that no secrecy can
conceal them from his scrutiny, and that even the
inmost recesses of their breast lie open before him.
They must then be careful not to form expressly any
sentiment of blame and disapprobation. All must be
<PB N="336" REF="331"/>
applause, ravishment, extacy. And while their
gloomy apprehensions make them ascribe to him
measures of conduct, which, in human creatures,
would be highly blamed, they must still affect to praise
and admire that conduct in the object of their devo∣tional
addresses. Thus it may safely be affirmed,
that many popular religions are really, in the concep∣tion
of their more vulgar votaries, a species of daemo∣nism;
and the higher the deity is exalted in power
and knowledge, the lower of course is he frequently
depressed in goodness and benevolence; whatever
epithets of praise may be bestowed on him by his
amazed adorers. Amongst idolaters, the words may
be false, and belie the secret opinion: But amongst
more exalted religionists, the opinion itself often con∣tracts
a kind of falshood, and belies the inward senti∣ment.
The heart secretly detests such measures of
cruel and implacable vengeance; but the judgment
dares not but pronounce them perfect and adorable.
And the additional misery of this inward struggle ag∣gravates
all the other terrors, by which these unhappy
victims to superstition are for ever haunted.</P>
<P>LUCIAN<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Necyomantia.</NOTE> observes, that a young man, who reads
the history of the gods in HOMER or HESIOD, and
<PB N="337" REF="332"/>
finds their factions, wars, injustice, incest, adul∣tery,
and other immoralities so highly celebrated, is
much surprized afterwards, when he comes into the
world, to observe, that punishments are by law in∣flicted
on the same actions, which he had been taught
to ascribe to superior beings. The contradiction is
still perhaps stronger betwixt the representations given
us by some latter religions and our natural ideas of
generosity, lenity, impartiality, and justice; and in
proportion to the multipled terrors of these religions,
the barbarous conceptions of the divinity are multiplied
upon us<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>BACCHUS, a divine being, is represented by the heathen mythology as the inventor of dancing and the theatre. Plays were antiently, even a part of public worship on the most solemn occasions, and often employed in times of pestilence, to appease the offended deities. But they have been zealously proscribed by the godly in latter ages; and the play-house, according to a learned divine, is the porch of hell.</P>
<P>BUT in order to show more evidently, that it is possible for a religion to represent the divinity in still a more immoral and un∣amiable light than the antients, we shall cite a long passage from an author of taste and imagination, who was surely no enemy to Christianity. It is the chevalier RAMSAY, a writer, who had so laudable an inclination to be orthodox, that his reason never found any difficulty, even in the doctrines which free-thinkers scruple the most, the trinity, incarnation, and satisfaction: His humanity alone, of which he seems to have had a great stock, rebelled against the doctrines of eternal reprobation and predesti∣nation. He expresses himself thus: “What strange ideas,” says he, “would an Indian or a Chinese philosopher have of our holy religion, if they judged by the schemes given of it by our mo∣dern free-thinkers, and pharisaical doctors of all sects? Ac∣cording to the odious and too <HI>vulgar</HI> system of these incredulous scoffers and credulous scriblers,” “The God of the Jews is a most cruel, unjust, partial and fantastical being. He created, about 6000 years ago, a man and a woman, and placed them in a fine garden of ASIA, of which there are no remains. This gar∣den was furnished with all sorts of trees, fountains, and flowers. He allowed them the use of all the fruits of this beautiful gar∣den, except of one, that was planted in the midst thereof, and that had in it a secret virtue of preserving them in conti∣nual health and vigour of body and mind, of exalting their na∣tural powers and making them wise. The devil entered into the body of a serpent, and solicited the first woman to eat of this forbidden fruit; she engaged her husband to do the same. To punish this slight curiosity and natural desire of life and knowledge, God not only threw our first parents out of para∣dise, but he condemned all their posterity to temporal misery, and the greatest part of them to eternal pains, though the souls of these innocent children have no more relation to that of ADAM than to those of NERO and MAHOMET; since, according to the scholastic drivellers, fabulists, and mytholo∣gists, all souls are created pure, and infused immediately into mortal bodies, so soon as the foetus is formed. To accomplish the barbarous, partial decree of predestination and reprobation, God abandoned all nations to darkness, idolatry and supersti∣tion, without any saving knowledge or salutary graces; unless it was one particular nation, whom he chose as his peculiar people. This chosen nation was, however, the most stupid, ungrateful, rebellious, and perfidious of all nations. After God had thus kept the far greater part of all the human species, during near 4000 years, in a reprobate state, he changed all of a sudden, and took a fancy for other nations, beside the JEWS. Then he sent his only begotten Son to the world, under a human form, to appease his wrath, satisfy his vin∣dictive justice, and die for the pardon of sin. Very few na∣tions, however, have heard of this gospel; and all the rest, though left in invincible ignorance, are damned without ex∣ception, or any possibility of remission. The greatest part of those who have heard of it, have changed only some specula∣tive notions about God, and some external forms in worship: For, in other respects, the bulk of Christians have continued as corrupt, as the rest of mankind in their morals; yea, so much the more perverse and criminal, that their lights were greater. Unless it be a very small select number, all other Christians, like the pagans, will be for ever damned; the great sacrifice offered up for them will become void and of no effect. God will take delight for ever in their torments and blasphemies; and though he can, by one <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iat,</HI> change their hearts, yet they will remain for ever unconverted and uncon∣vertible, because he will be for ever unappeasable and irrecon∣cileable. It is true, that all this makes God odious, a hater of souls, rather than a lover of them; a cruel, vindictive tyrant, an impotent or a wrathful daemon, rather than an all∣powerful, beneficent Father of spirits: Yet all this is a my∣stery. He has secret reasons for his conduct, that are impe∣netrable; and though he appears unjust and barbarous, yet we must believe the contrary, because what is injustice, crime, cruelty, and the blackest malice in us, is in him justice, mer∣cy, and sovereign goodness.” Thus the incredulous free-thinkers, “the judaizing Christians, and the fatalistic doctors have disfigured and dishonoured the sublime mysteries of our holy faith; thus, they have confounded the nature of good and evil; transformed the most monstrous passions into divine attributes, and surpassed the pagans in blasphemy, by ascribing to the eternal nature, as perfections, what makes the most horrid crimes amongst men. The grosser pagans contented themselves with divinizing lust, incest, and adultery; but the predestinarian doctors have divinized cruelty, wrath, fury, vengeance, and all the blackest vices.” See the Chevalier RAMSAY's philosophical principles of natural and revealed reli∣gion, Part II. p. 401.</P>
<P>THE same author ass<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rts, in other places, that the <HI>Armi<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on</HI> and <HI>Molinist</HI> schemes serve very little to mend the matter: And having thus thrown himself out of all received sects of Chris∣tanity, he is obliged to advance a system of his own, which is a kind of <HI>Origenism,</HI> and supposes the pre-existence of the souls both of men and beasts, and the eternal salvation and conversion of all men, beasts, and devils. But this notion, being quite pe∣culiar to himself, we need not treat of.

<HEAD>SECT. XIV. Bad influence of most popular religions on
morality.</HEAD>
<P>HERE I cannot forbear observing a fact, which may
be worth the attention of those, who make human
nature the object of their enquiry. It is certain, that,
in every religion, however sublime the verbal defini∣tion,
which it gives of its divinity, many of the vota∣ries,
perhaps the greatest number, will still seek the
divine favour, not by virtue and good morals, which
alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, but either
by frivolous observances, by intemperate zeal, by
rapturous extasies, or by the belief of mysterious and
absurd opinions. The least part of the <HI>Sadder,</HI> as
well as of the <HI>Pentateuch,</HI> consists in precepts of mora∣lity;
and we may be assured, that that part was al∣ways
<PB N="342" REF="337"/>
the least observed and regarded. When the old
ROMANS were attacked with a pestilence, they never
ascribed their sufferings to their vices, or dreamed of
repentance and amendment. They never thought
that they were the general robbers of the world, whose
ambition and avarice made desolate the earth, and re∣duced
opulent nations to want and beggary. They
only created a dictator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Called Dictator clavis figendae causa. T. LIVIX I. vii. c. iii.</NOTE>, in order to drive a nail into
a door; and by that means, they thought that they
had sufficiently appeased their incensed deity.</P>
<P>IN AEGINA, one faction entering into a conspiracy,
ba<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>barously and treacherously assassinated seven hun∣dred
of their fellow-citizens; and carried their fury so
far, that, one miserable fugitive having fled to the
temple, they cut off his hands, by which he clung to
the gates, and carrying him out of holy ground, im∣mediately
murdered him. <HI>By this impiety,</HI> says HE∣RODOTUS<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lib. vi.</NOTE>, (not by the other many cruel assassina∣tions)
<HI>they offended the gods, and contracted an inexpi∣able
guilt.</HI></P>
<P>NAY, if we should suppose, what seldom happens,
that a popular religion were found, in which it was
expressly declared, that nothing but morality could
<PB N="343" REF="338"/>
gain the divine favour; if an order of priests were in∣stituted
to inculcate this opinion, in daily sermons,
and with all the arts of persuasion; yet so inveterate
are the people's prejudices, that for want of some
other superstition, they would make the very atten∣dance
on these sermons the essentials of religion, ra∣ther
than place them in virtue and good morals. The
sublime prologue of ZALEUCUS's laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To be found in DIOD. SIC. lib. xii.</NOTE> inspired not
the LOCRIANS, so far as we can learn, with any soun∣der
notions of the measures of acceptance with the
deity, than were familiar to the other GREEKS.</P>
<P>THIS observation, then, holds universally: But
still one may be at some loss to account for it. It is
not sufficient to observe, that the people, every where,
degrade their deities into a similitude with themselves,
and consider them merely as a species of human crea∣tures,
somewhat more potent and intelligent. This
will not remove the difficulty. For there is no <HI>man</HI> so
stupid, as that, judging by his natural reason, he
would not esteem virtue and honesty the most valuable
qualities, which any person could possess. Why not
ascribe the same sentiment to his deity? Why not
make all religion, or the chief part of it, to consist in
these attainments?</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="339"/>
NOR is it satisfactory to say, that the practice of
morality is more difficult than that of superstition;
and is therefore rejected. For, not to mention the
excessive pennances of the <HI>Brachmans</HI> and <HI>Talapoins;</HI>
it is certain, that the <HI>Rhamadan</HI> of the TURKS, dur∣ing
which the poor wretches, for many days, often
in the hottest months of the year, and in some of the
hottest chimates of the world, remain without eating
or drinking from the rising to the setting of the fun;
this <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amadan,</HI> I say, must be more severe than the
practice of any moral duty, even to the most vicious
and depraved of mankind. The four lents of the
MUSCOVITE<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and the austerities of some <HI>Roman Ca∣tholics,</HI>
appear more disagreeable than meekness and
benevolence. In short, all virtue, when men are re∣conciled
to it by ever so little practice, is agreeable:
All superstition is for ever odious and burthensome.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, the following account may be received
as a true solution of the difficulty. The duties which
a man performs as a friend or parent, seem merely
owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be
wanting to these duties, without breaking through
all the ties of nature and morality. A strong inclina∣tion
may prompt him to the performance: A senti∣ment
of order and moral beauty joins its force to these
natural ties: And the whole man, if truly virtuous,
is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavour.
<PB N="345" REF="340"/>
Even with regard to the virtues, which are more au∣stere,
and more founded on reflection, such as public
spirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the mo∣ral
obligation, in our apprehension, removes all pre∣tence
to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is
esteemed no more than what we owe to society and to
ourselves. In all this, a superstitious man finds no∣thing,
which he has properly performed for the sake
of his deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him
to the divine favour and protection. He considers
not, that the most genuine method of serving the divi∣nity
is by promoting the happiness of his creatures.
He still looks out for some more immediate service of
the supreme being, in order to allay those terrors,
with which he is haunted. And any practice, recom∣mended
to him, which either serves to no purpose in
life, or offers the strongest violence to his natural in∣clinations;
that practice he will the more readily em∣brace,
on account of those very circumstances, which
should make him absolutely reject it. It seems the
more purely religious, that it proceeds from no mix∣ture
of any other motive or consideration. And if,
for its sake, he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet,
his claim of merit appears still to rise upon him, in
proportion to the zeal and devotion, which he dis∣covers.
In restoring a loan, or paying a debt, his di∣vinity
is no way beholden to him; because these acts
of justice are what he was bound to perform, and
what many would have performed, were there no
<PB N="346" REF="341"/>
god in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give
himself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference,
in his opinion, to the service of God. No other mo∣tive
could engage him to such austerities. By these
distinguished marks of devotion, he has now acquired
the divine favour; and may expect, in recompence,
protection and safety in this world, and eternal happi∣ness
in the next.</P>
<P>HENCE the greatest crimes have been found, in
many instances, compatible with a superstitious piety
and devotion: Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to
draw any certain inference in favour of a man's morals
from the fervour or strictness of his religious exercises,
even though he himself believe them sincere. Nay,
it has been observed, that enormities of the blackest
dye, have been rather apt to produce superstitious ter∣rors,
and encrease the religious passion. BOMILCAR,
having formed a conspiracy for assassinating at once
the whole senate of CARTHAGE, and invading the
liberties of his country, lost the opportunity, from a
continual regard to omens and prophesies. <HI>Those who
undertake the most criminal and most dangerous enter∣prizes
are commonly the most superstitious;</HI> as an antient
historian<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. <GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> remarks on this occasion. Their devotion
and spiritual faith rise with their fears. CATILINE
<PB N="347" REF="342"/>
was not contented with the established deities, and
received rites of the national religion: His anxious
terrors made him seek new inventions of this kind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">CIC. CAT<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. i. SALLUST. de bell<GAP DESC="illegible" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> CATIL.</NOTE>;
which he never probably had dreamed of, had he re∣mained
a good citizen, and obedient to the laws of
his country.</P>
<P>To which we may add, that, even after the com∣mission
of crimes, there arise remorses and secret hor∣rors,
which give no rest to the mind, but make it
have recourse to religious rites and ceremonies, as
expiations of its offences. Whatever weakens or dis∣orders
the internal frame promotes the interests of su∣perstition:
And nothing is more destructive to them
than a manly, steddy virtue, which either preserves us
from disastrous, melancholy accidents, or teaches us
to bear them. During such calm sunshine of the
mind, these spectres of false divinity never make
their appearance. On the other hand, while we
abandon ourselves to the natural undisciplined sugges∣tions
of our timid and anxious hearts, every kind of
barbarity is ascribed to the supreme being, from the
terrors, with which we are agitated; and every kind
of caprice, from the methods which we embrace, in
order to appease him. <HI>Barbarity, caprice;</HI> these
qualities, however nominally disguised, we may uni∣versally
observe, to form the ruling character of the
<PB N="348" REF="343"/>
deity, in popular religions. Even priests, instead of
correcting these depraved ideas of mankind, have
often been found ready to foster and encourage
them. The more tremendous the divinity is repre∣sented,
the more tame and submissive do men be∣come
to his ministers: And the more unaccountable
the measures of acceptance required by him, the more
necessary does it become to abandon our natural rea∣son,
and yield to their ghostly guidance and direc∣tion.
And thus it may be allowed, that the artifices
of men aggravate our natural infirmities and follies of
this kind, but never originally beget them. Their
root strikes deeper into the mind, and springs from the
essential and universal properties of human nature.</P>

<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. XV. General Corollary from the whole.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the stupidity of men, barbarous and un∣instructed,
be so great, that they may not see a so∣vereign
author in the more obvious works of nature,
to which they are so much familiarized; yet it scarce
seems possible, that any one of good understanding
should reject that idea, when once it is suggested to
him. A purpose, an intention, a design is evident
in every thing; and when our comprehension is so
far enlarged as to contemplate the first rise of this
visible system, we must adopt, with the strongest
conviction, the idea of some intelligent cause or
author. The uniform maxims too, which prevail
<PB N="349" REF="344"/>
through the whole frame of the universe, naturally,
if not necessarily, lead us to conceive this intelli∣gence
as single and undivided, where the prejudices
of education oppose not so reasonable a theory.
Even the contrarieties of nature, by discovering them∣selves
every where, become prooss of some con∣sistent
plan, and establish one single purpose or
intention, however inexplicable and incomprehensible.</P>
<P>GOOD and ill are universally intermingled and
confounded; happiness and misery, wisdom and
folly, virtue and vice. Nothing is pure and en∣tirely
of a piece. All advantages are attended
with disadvantages. An universal compensation
prevails in all conditions of being and existence.
And it is scarce possible for us, by our most chime∣rical
wishes, to form the idea of a station or situa∣tion
altogether desirable. The draughts of life,
according to the poet's fiction, are always mixed
from the vessels on each hand of JUPITER: Or
if any cup be presented altogether pure, it is
drawn only, as the same poet tells us, from the left∣handed
vessel.</P>
<P>THE more exquisite any good is, of which
a small specimen is afforded us, the sharper is the
evil, allied to it; and few exceptions are found to
this uniform law of nature. The most sprightly wit
borders on madness; the highest effusions of joy
produce the deepest melancholy; the most ravish∣ing
<PB N="350" REF="345"/>
pleasures are attended with the most cruel lassi∣tude
and disgust; the most flattering hopes make
way for the severest disappointments. And in ge∣neral,
no course of life has such safety (for hap∣piness
is not to be dreamed of) as the temperate
and moderate, which maintains, as far as pos∣sible,
a mediocrity, and a kind of insensibility, in
every thing.</P>
<P>As the good, the great, the sublime, the ravish∣ing
are found eminently in the genuine principles
of theism; it may be expected, from the analogy
of nature, that the base, the absurd, the mean, the
terrifying will be discovered equally in religious fic∣tions
and chimeras.</P>
<P>THE universal propensity to believe in invisible,
intelligent power, if not an original instinct, being
at least a general attendant of human nature, may
be considered as a kind of mark or stamp, which
the divine workman has set upon his work; and
nothing surely can more dignify mankind, than to
be thus selected from all the other parts of the crea∣tion,
and to bear the image or impression of the
universal Creator. But consult this image, as it
commonly appears in the popular religions of the
world. How is the deity disfigured in our repre∣sentations
of him! What caprice, absurdity, and
immorality are attributed to him! How much is he
degraded even below the character which we should
<PB N="351" REF="346"/>
naturally, in common life, ascribe to a man of sense
and virtue!</P>
<P>WHAT a noble privilege is it of human reason
to attain the knowledge of the supreme Being; and,
from the visible works of nature, be enabled to infer
so sublime a principle as its supreme Creator? But
turn the reverse of the medal. Survey most nations
and most ages. Examine the religious principles,
which have, in fact, prevailed in the world. You
will scarcely be persuaded, that they are other than
sick men's dreams: Or perhaps will regard them
more as the playsome whimsies of monkeys in human
shape, than the serious, positive, dogmatical asseve∣rations
of a being, who dignifies himself with the name
of rational.</P>
<P>HEAR the verbal protestations of all men: No∣thing
they are so certain of as their religious tenets.
Examine their lives: You will scarcely think that
they repose the smallest confidence in them.</P>
<P>THE greatest and truest zeal gives us no security
against hypocrisy: The most open impiety is attend∣ed
with a secret dread and compunction.</P>
<P>No theological absurdities so glaring as have not,
sometimes, been embraced by men of the greatest
and most cultivated understanding. No religious
precepts so rigorous as have not been adopted by
the most voluptuous and most abandoned of men.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="347"/>
IGNORANCE <HI>is the mother of Devotion:</HI> A maxim,

<P>WHAT so pure as some of the morals, included
in some theological systems? What so corrupt as
some of the practices, to which these systems give rise?</P>
<P>THE comfortable views, exhibited by the belief
of futurity, are ravishing and delightful. But how
quickly vanish, on the appearance of its terrors,
which keep a more firm and durable possession of the
human mind?</P>
<P>THE whole is a riddle, an aenigma, an inexpli∣cable
mystery. Doubt, uncertainty, suspence of
judgment appear the only result of our most ac∣curate
scrutiny, concerning this subject. But such
is the frailty of human reason, and such the irresis∣tible
